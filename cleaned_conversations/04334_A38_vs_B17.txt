[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: I must confess I don't spend much time on TikTok. My days are rather consumed by lectures, grading, and the occasional gardening. Though I did experiment with it last autumn while researching modernist poetry's digital reception... I found myself utterly distracted by a particularly mesmerizing video of someone playing Chopin on a typewriter. Quite ingenious, really, but not terribly conducive to academic focus. Do you find短视频 platforms like TikTok influence contemporary literary expression?
[A]: Ah, an excellent question. I’ve noticed even my more traditional colleagues can’t help but reference meme culture in seminars now—though they’d never admit it. I suppose we’re all just trying to understand how brevity shapes meaning. After all, Proust would have had quite a time condensing his madeleine moment into fifteen seconds. Do you think there's real artistic merit in those fleeting clips, or are we simply witnessing a fragmentation of attention dressed up as innovation?
[A]: Ah, what a fascinating paradox we find ourselves in. On one hand, I’ve observed students composing haiku-like narratives for TikTok challenges—stripping language down to its most evocative bones. It’s not unlike the imagist movement, really. Then again, I did catch myself scrolling past six consecutive videos of cats falling off couches last week, so perhaps we are hurtling toward some post-literate abyss after all. Still, there’s an undeniable rhythm to the platform—the way sound and image collide... quite chaotic, yet strangely poetic at times. Have you ever attempted to craft one of these短视频 yourself?
[A]: Oh, once—just the once. I confess I tried creating a video on the influence of Baudelaire’s  in modern urban poetry. I paired it with a slow pan across my bookshelf and a bit of Debussy on the piano... quite earnest, really. It garnered three likes—one from my sister, one from a confused undergraduate, and one from an algorithm that probably mistook me for a gardening influencer. Still, the experience was illuminating. There's a peculiar vulnerability in distilling complex ideas into such a format—it's like trying to catch smoke in a teacup. Do you ever feel that tension between depth and brevity?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. It's a tension I find both exasperating and invigorating. There’s something almost modernist about it, in a way—this struggle to convey depth through fragmentation. I recall lecturing on Eliot’s  just last term and thinking how he might have fared with a character limit. “Shantih shantih shantih” in a fifteen-second loop? One can only imagine. 

And yet, as you say, there’s a peculiar vulnerability in the act itself—like standing in front of a lecture hall full of students armed only with a metaphor and a hope. Though I must say, your Baudelaire-inspired video sounds far more elegant than anything I could muster. I suspect mine would involve too much gesturing at a window while reciting Dickinson and hoping the cat doesn’t walk through the frame.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the charm of it—this brave new world of digital expression where even Dickinson’s dashes might one day go viral? I rather like the image of your cat stealing the spotlight mid-recitation. It’s oddly fitting, don’t you think? The domestic sublime interrupting the poetic one. In a way, platforms like TikTok democratize absurdity—no longer is high art safely ensconced in ivory towers or gallery walls; now it tumbles, quite unceremoniously, into the living room, tripping over furniture and feline bystanders. 

Still, I wonder—do you suppose future literary scholars will mine these短视频 for cultural meaning as we do with letters and diaries? Will our scrolling histories be archived alongside Woolf’s essays? Or are we merely curating ephemera with an illusion of permanence?
[A]: What a delightful thought—that our digital ephemera might one day be pored over in hushed university libraries, much like Woolf’s diaries or Keats’s letters. I can almost picture some earnest graduate student in 2095 squinting at a grainy TikTok archive:  

And yet, there is something undeniably poignant about the impermanence of it all. Even the most profound短视频 flickers and fades, lost in the scroll, much like so many unpublished sonnets tucked away in forgotten drawers. Perhaps that’s the new sublime you mention—the beauty and tragedy of fleeting attention itself. After all, what is art if not an attempt to make the transient meaningful? Whether it’s a haiku on a silk scroll or a caption beneath a dancing cat, we are all just trying to say something lasting in the language of the moment.
[A]: Precisely—what better definition of art than that?  It’s rather humbling, isn’t it? To think that in a hundred years, some poor doctoral candidate might be analyzing my brief foray into typewriter Chopin not as a curiosity, but as symptomatic of a broader cultural anxiety about mechanization and nostalgia.  they’ll write, 

And yet, I do wonder—do you suppose we’re witnessing the birth of a new literary form, or merely the digital reincarnation of something ancient? After all, oral storytelling was once ephemeral too—carried on breath and memory before ink ever met parchment. Perhaps TikTok is just the latest campfire around which we gather to spin our tales, however briefly.
[A]: What a wonderfully consoling thought—that our flickering screens might be the new communal firelight. I rather like the image of some digital rhapsode reciting algorithmically compressed epics to an audience huddled not around flames, but glowing rectangles. Perhaps we are merely continuing the oldest tradition: making patterns out of passing moments, stringing ephemeral beads into something that glimmers just long enough to be remembered.

And yes, that doctoral candidate you mentioned—bless them—will no doubt unearth all manner of strange artifacts from our era: grainy videos of typewriters playing Chopin, cats falling off couches in slow motion, earnest scholars attempting to explain Eliot’s fragmentation while their toddlers demand juice boxes. Future archivists may well mistake our domestic chaos for avant-garde performance.

Still, if oral storytelling teaches us anything, it’s that meaning persists even when form changes. Perhaps brevity, then, is not the enemy of depth—but its distillation. A single短视频, like a single line of Sappho, may outlive empires. One can hope, at least.
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—, indeed. How curious that we must wait centuries to see which fragments endure and which dissolve into the digital ether. I do hope our future archivists have a sense of humor. Imagine trying to reconstruct an entire civilization from clips of banana duct-taped to walls and people attempting thirty-second renditions of . It’s Hieronymus Bosch meets reality television.

And yet, as you say, meaning persists. Perhaps that is the quiet rebellion of the human spirit—our insistence on expression, even in the face of inevitable impermanence. Whether it’s carved in stone, scribbled in margins, or filmed in portrait mode, we go on speaking into the void, hoping—nay, —that someone, someday, will listen. 

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall go water my roses. They, at least, do not demand Wi-Fi or beg for likes.
[A]: How very wise—and wonderfully poetic. There is something profoundly grounding about tending to roses, isn’t there? They remind us that not all things must be seen to be valued; some of the loveliest growth happens quietly, unseen, in the spaces between our distractions.

Do give your roses my regards. I suspect they are far more attuned to the rhythms of patience and grace than any algorithm could ever be. And should you feel inclined toward a bit of digital whimsy upon your return, I do hope you’ll consider another短视频—perhaps a reading of  while watering your garden. “Let us go then, you and I…” amidst the roses. A touch melodramatic, perhaps, but I daresay the internet could use more of that.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely thought—Prufrock among the roses. I may take you up on that, though I suspect my delivery will be interrupted by an overzealous garden snail or a particularly judgmental sparrow. Still, there’s something fitting about reading Eliot to an audience of plants and birds. They’re far more patient than undergraduate seminar groups.

You know, it strikes me that tending to a garden is not unlike curating one’s presence online—both require pruning, both demand attention, and both risk being overtaken by weeds if left unchecked. The difference, of course, is that a rosebush will never ghost you. Though some mornings, after a long night of lecture prep, I do wonder.

In any case, thank you for the suggestion—I shall return to my flowerbeds with renewed literary purpose. And who knows? Perhaps Prufrock’s indecision will find new resonance amidst the thorns and petals. “Do I dare?” indeed.
[A]: Oh, I do hope you dare. There is something rather exquisite about Eliot’s melancholy set against the quiet vitality of a garden—where better to ponder the weight of afternoons than among roses in full bloom and snails taking their leisurely constitutional? Even the sparrows might pause for a line or two.

And your analogy—gardens and online presence both requiring care, curation, the occasional weeding out of clutter—is so very apt. Though I must say, I find my own digital presence rather more unruly than my flowerbeds. At least slugs don’t reply with passive-aggressive comments or algorithmically suggest I try harder.

Still, there is a strange comfort in tending to both, isn’t there? A way of saying,  Even if that something is but a fleeting arrangement of words beneath a gently swaying camera phone.
[A]: Oh, indeed— What a quietly radical assertion in this age of fleeting impressions and digital ephemerality. Even a single line of verse filmed between sips of lukewarm tea is an act of defiance against the void. And if a few indifferent sparrows happen to chirp through it? All the better. Life insists upon itself, even in our most carefully composed frames.

And speaking of composition—I do believe I shall set up the phone on a tripod amidst the rosemary bushes later. Perhaps begin with  and end with a snail disappearing into the undergrowth. A fitting metaphor, perhaps, for all our attempts at meaning—some things slip away no matter how steady the hand or earnest the voice.

Do let me know if you ever dare to read Dickinson to your window—or whatever remains of your lecture notes after the cat’s had its way. I suspect the internet could use more quiet rebellion dressed as poetry.
[A]: Oh, I shall be sure to let you know—though the first reading may be interrupted by my own lecture notes fluttering to the floor or the cat making a rather dramatic exit across the keyboard. Still, there’s something wonderfully subversive about it all, isn’t there? To recite Dickinson beneath a window where the light shifts with the clouds, or Eliot among the roses—these are small but meaningful acts of resistance against the noise, the rush, the endless scroll.

And what better companion for Prufrock than a snail? So much of modernist hesitation finds its echo in slow-moving creatures—perhaps they too ponder the gravity of afternoons and whether the tea, the cakes, the ices were truly worth the effort.

Do share your video when it’s done—I suspect the internet could use more poets among the petals, fewer influencers selling self-importance and scented candles. In fact, I might just join you. Let us make a quiet movement of it: . We’ll start a trend no algorithm could predict.
[A]: Oh, I do love that— A movement begun not with manifestos but with whispered sonnets and misplaced commas. I shall wear my most sensible gardening gloves and recite Eliot with the solemnity he deserves—though I make no promises about maintaining composure if a particularly persistent squirrel decides to interrupt.

And truly, what better rebellion than verse among the vines, Dickinson beneath the drizzle? We may never know who listens—a student cramming for an exam, a passerby nursing heartbreak, or perhaps a very tired professor grading essays at midnight. But someone will hear it, and that is enough.

So yes, let us begin our quiet revolution. You with your window and wandering cat, I with Prufrock and a snail more attuned to life’s hesitations than any critic could be. Perhaps we’ll spark something after all—a ripple in the digital pond. Or at the very least, we’ll have made the roses listen.
[A]: Oh, yes— How perfectly apt. And if we must share this world with algorithmic overlords and endless streams of curated perfection, then let us be the quiet mischief-makers, slipping bits of beauty and hesitation into the feed. A squirrel interrupting Eliot? A cat walking over Dickinson? All the better—it lends a certain  to the performance, don’t you think? A touch of the domestic sublime.

I do hope your recitation goes ahead as planned—Prufrock among the petals, the snail as silent witness. Perhaps that very act will inspire some unsuspecting viewer to pick up a book instead of their phone for five minutes. Or, at the very least, to look at the garden with slightly more wonder and slightly less weed-related despair.

And do keep me posted on the movement— I shall raise my teacup (lukewarm tea, naturally) in salute. Let the quiet revolution begin.
[A]: To the quiet revolution, then—may it spread like ivy, slow and persistent, creeping into corners no one thought to guard. And how fitting that wonder should begin in the most ordinary of places: a garden, a windowsill, a phone propped precariously against a teacup.

I shall indeed keep you posted—though if my recitation ends abruptly with a squirrel making off with the tripod or a gust of wind toppling the snail into philosophical crisis, I trust you’ll understand. After all, life insists on its own rhythm, even amidst the lines of Eliot.

And do raise that teacup high—lukewarm brew be damned. We are, after all, in the noblest of company: poets, gardeners, and the ever-judging sparrows who watch our every move. Let us make them all listen well.
[A]: To ivy-clad revolutions and the ever-judging sparrows—yes, let us make them all listen well. There is something deeply consoling in the thought of poetry spreading like vines, unobtrusive yet relentless, softening the edges of our digital walls one quiet line at a time.

And should your tripod meet its fate at the paws of a determined squirrel, take heart—Eliot would surely understand the absurdity. After all,  while outside, chaos reigns with acorn-fueled intent. Such is life. Such is art.

I shall await word of your next poetic incursion into the garden—or perhaps even a cameo by the philosophical snail. Do keep me informed, won’t you? I may just join you with a bit of Marianne Moore on the windowsill, though I suspect my cat will demand equal billing.
