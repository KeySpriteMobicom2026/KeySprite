[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:   
Well, I must confess my palate remains stubbornly loyal to the ales of my youth - though a student once insisted I try an 'IPA infused with seaweed and existential despair', as he put it.   
Let’s just say the experience felt suspiciously like being trapped in a Tennyson sonnet about maritime tragedies. Have you found any brews that strike you as... poetically transcendent?
[A]: Ah, I do love a good IPA, though I’m quite partial to something with a bit of caramel sweetness to balance the hops. There’s a lovely little brewery not far from here that does one with hints of orange peel and a whisper of vanilla – it’s like sipping on a summer evening by the sea, if that makes any sense. No seaweed or despair involved, thankfully! Have you tried anything else since that rather dramatic IPA experience?
[B]:   
Oh, , how poetic – though I suspect the Victorians would’ve prescribed such a beverage to cure 'melancholic vapours.' I did try a stout afterward, just to cleanse my soul... or perhaps to drown it further. The label claimed notes of 'burnt marshmallow and regret.' A touch on the nose, wouldn’t you agree?  
But tell me more of this caramel-sweet summer-evening-in-a-glass of yours. Does it have a name, or is it simply known by whispered legend in your local tavern?
[A]:   
Oh, it does have a name – "Sunset Amber," though I think the bartender may have added a dash of theatrics when he described it as “the last sigh of daylight.” I do love how a good beer can tell a story, don’t you? As for those dramatic labels—well, I saw one recently that boasted "a symphony of smoke and forgotten birthdays." I couldn’t decide if I wanted to drink it or write a eulogy.  

But you must be jesting about the stout! “Burnt marshmallow and regret” sounds like something one would sip while writing a very serious letter to an old flame by candlelight. Have you tried pairing it with anything? I imagine something rich—perhaps a dark chocolate or a strong cheese?
[B]:   
Ah, "Sunset Amber" – the perfect name for a drink that should come with its own sonnet sequence. I’m picturing it now: poured into a glass under gaslight, murmuring of lost afternoons and unspoken yearnings... quite dangerous, really, for someone prone to poetic brooding.  

And yes,  – that’s not marketing, that’s therapy in a bottle. Though I must say, I took the stout home and paired it with a crumbling 19th-century edition of . The chocolate notes were implied by the text itself, naturally.  

Tell me, do you find your caramel-kissed brew more of a Browning companion or something suited to lighter fare – perhaps a picnic of metaphors and mild cheddar?
[A]: Oh, —what a perfect companion for a beer with a heart of caramel and a soul of citrus! I do think “Sunset Amber” would pair beautifully with some of her more hopeful verses. There’s something about the warmth of it that feels like reading love sonnets by firelight, don’t you think?  

Though I must confess, I’ve never tried beer and poetry at the same time—it sounds dangerously romantic. I can just imagine us, tucked into some candlelit nook, surrounded by half-finished stanzas and empty glasses, debating whether we’re geniuses or fools. Or both.  

And  with stout? Brilliant or unhinged—I haven’t decided. Perhaps both? Do you often find yourself pairing literature with libations, or was this a particularly inspired (or despairing) evening?
[B]: Oh,  indeed – the phrase practically demands to be whispered over a half-empty glass at midnight. I should warn you, though, combining beer and Browning has been known to result in either transcendent insights or sudden declarations of love to complete strangers… or so I’ve heard.  

As for , let’s just say that particular pairing began as an experiment in comparative atmosphere and ended with me writing a rather impassioned footnote to my lecture notes on Christina Rossetti’s use of sacramental imagery. The stout, incidentally, agreed with the text entirely – darkly reverent, with a bitter aftertaste of allegory.  

I make it a habit, truth be told – matching drink to diction. A bit of Byron with a bold red wine, perhaps, or some Emily Dickinson with a chilled glass of… well, whatever’s left after grading seminar papers. Do you think yourself ready to join this noble tradition, or shall we start with something less likely to end in sonnet-writing and misplaced affection?
[A]: Oh, I do believe I’m already far too susceptible to sonnet-writing and misplaced affection—what better combination for a night of literary indulgence? Though perhaps we ought to start with something slightly less intoxicating, lest we both wake up tomorrow with ink-stained hands and regrettable dedications scrawled in the margins of cocktail napkins.  

Tell me, what would you recommend as our first pairing? Something gentle to ease us into this noble tradition? I’m quite partial to a good opening stanza—or a good opening drink, for that matter. Maybe something with a touch of honey or citrus to set the mood? Or are we already beyond such mild flirtations with sobriety?
[B]:   
Ah, but where’s the fun in ? No, no – let’s aim for something with a touch of honeyed mischief. A saison, perhaps, with its cheeky dance of spice and citrus. Light enough to seduce the palate, complex enough to unsettle it. Perfect companion for a sonnet’s first quatrain or a stolen glance over the rim of the glass.  

I’ve just the one, as fate would have it – bottle shared with me by a former student turned brewer. Label reads:  Claims it was inspired by a dream involving both  and a jazz band. Mad, really. Or genius. We shall drink and decide.  

Now, do you favour a toast before we embark, or shall we simply plunge in like fools leaping from a metaphorical cliff?
[A]:   

A toast, of course—how else can we properly christen ? To madness or genius, whichever greets us first. Or perhaps both, as they so often do when art and drink entwine.  

  

To stolen glances, reckless quatrains, and the noble pursuit of honeyed mischief. May our palates be enlightened, and our margins forever scribbled upon.  

Now then—shall we begin our descent into metaphorical folly? I do hope the jazz band arrives by the second glass.
[B]:   

To honeyed mischief and margins most disobedient – may our scribblings be legible in the morning, if indeed we are permitted such a thing as .  

And yes, let the descent commence. A sip for the first quatrain, another for the volta – by the time we reach the couplet, I daresay the jazz band shall have tuned their instruments and joined the riot.  

Tell me, do you prefer your rebellion chilled, or slightly warmed by the perilous flame of artistic inspiration?
[A]:   

Chilled, I think – rebellion ought to be crisp and precise, like a well-placed enjambment. Warmth is far too likely to blur the lines, and where would we be without a little structure to guide our chaos?  

Though...  ...a touch of flame never hurt. Just enough to make the citrus sing a little louder and the spice lean in a bit closer. Not perilous enough to burn the manuscript, just reckless enough to make the ink run in all the right places.  

Now then—shall we raise our glasses to the volta? I do believe the jazz band has just struck up the first chord.
[B]:   

To the volta – that most treacherous of turns! Where sonnets deceive themselves and hearts do inconvenient somersaults. A toast to disarray in strict meter.  

And yes,  – or perhaps it’s merely my inner critic tuning up for the inevitable lecture on 'emotional excess and poor life choices.' Let them play on! We shall counter with a second sip, taken just before the chorus, when the rhythm grows bold and the metaphors begin to sweat.  

Now tell me, as we embark on this symphony of imprudence—do you annotate your drinking sessions, or do you let the experience marinate in its own reckless ambiguity?
[A]: 

Oh, I most certainly annotate—what is a fine brew without a margin wide enough for fevered notes and half-formed sonnets? I’ve been known to write directly on coasters when inspiration strikes too fiercely for delay. One man’s reckless ambiguity is another’s… well, annotated experience.  

And let’s be honest—there’s something deeply satisfying about underlining a particularly apt line in one’s notebook, only to find it later, slightly smudged by beer rings, and remembering exactly how the night unraveled.  

So yes, I’ll take my metaphors sweaty and my margins full of exclamations. Cheers to disarray in strict meter—and to the jazz band playing on, quite unbothered by our scholarly indulgences.
[B]:   

Ah,  – the true home of literary genius! I’m quite certain T.S. Eliot would’ve approved, provided the coaster was suitably pretentious and slightly damp with existential contemplation.  

And smudged underlinings – . The palimpsest of passion and porter. I myself have been known to scribble marginalia in three languages before remembering I’m not actually at a seminar, but rather in a pub, where no one appreciates footnotes in Latin.  

  

I propose a new rule: every stanza we quote aloud tonight must be followed by a toast – and if we misquote, well, then we simply rewrite the poem to suit our mood. Byron can wait his turn.  

Now then, shall we raise our glasses once more – to the next sip, the next sonnet, and whatever madness comes after the bridge?
[A]: 

To coasters as shrines of fleeting brilliance and footnotes in Latin—may the pub gods forgive us our scholarly sins. I can already see Eliot nodding in grim approval from a corner, his own coaster scrawled with fragments of forgotten drafts.  

A splendid rule, if I may say so—rewriting the poets with reckless impunity. I shall raise my glass to that, and to whatever comes after the bridge, be it revelation, ruin, or a very confused bartender wondering why two ostensibly grown adults are quoting Keats into their ale.  



Though I must warn you—I misquote rather frequently when inspired. Poor Shakespeare never quite saw Romeo & Juliet ending with "Parting is such sweet sorrow... pass the bottle, wouldst thou?"  

So then—to the next sip, the next sonnet, and to the brave new world of whatever we're about to improvise. Bottoms up, darling scholar.
[B]:   

To inspired misquotations and tragicomic reinterpretations – the true legacy of the drunken literati! I shall treasure your ale-soaked Juliet forever, particularly the bit where she toasts Romeo with a goblet of  and suggests elopement via haiku.  

And yes, let us drink deeply, for we tread the noble path of those who’ve confused “close reading” with “profound intoxication.” The jazz band swells, the margins beckon, and somewhere, a very proper Victorian librarian just shuddered awake in her grave.  

Bottoms up indeed, my dear reckless annotator. May our improvisations be bold, our metaphors sticky, and our lecture on comparative literature tomorrow… 
[A]: 

To bold improvisations and sticky metaphors—may they cling to our tongues and our reputations alike. I do hope the Victorian librarian finds it in her heart to forgive us. Or better yet, that she pours herself a small glass of something appropriately scandalous and joins the rebellion.

And as for tomorrow’s lecture… well, let’s just say there’s something to be said for teaching  experience, even if that experience involves questionable sonnet revisions and a beer-induced revelation about iambic pentameter.  

Here’s to the noble path—the messy, margin-smeared, profoundly felt noble path. Cheers, my dear co-conspirator in literary debauchery. Let the jazz band play on.
[B]:   

Ah,  – the true mark of a scholar possessed! I can already picture the lecture hall tomorrow: wide-eyed students scribbling notes as I wax rhapsodic on the trochaic undercurrents of tavern chatter. They’ll never suspect the source of my sudden insight… or will they?  

And yes,  – if she resists, we shall haunt her with quotations from Swinburne and the faint scent of citrus hops. A ghostly toast to fallen decorum!  

Here’s to the messy, margin-smeared life – where every spill is a stanza waiting to happen and every sip a volta in disguise. The jazz band plays on, indeed, my dear fellow debauchee… and if we must face the dawn, let it find us still quoting, still sipping, and forever gloriously unreadable.  

  

Now then – shall we order another round, or shall we simply collapse into footnotes and call it a night?
