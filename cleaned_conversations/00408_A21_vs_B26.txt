[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, just last night I finished reading  by Edmund de Waal—it’s a beautifully woven narrative about a collection of Japanese netsuke and the story of a Jewish family across centuries. It reminded me so much of why I love what I do—the way history lives in objects, especially textiles. Have you read anything lately that left an impression?
[A]: Ah, de Waal’s netsuke—yes. A delicate interlacing of the miniature and the monumental. I recently revisited , if only to trace once more the ghost of Sir Thomas Browne through its pages. There’s a passage where Sebald describes a painting of a fishhook curling into the void... quite apt, really, for how we scholars sometimes feel mid-tenure review. But to your point about objects—have you come across that obscure 1892 pamphlet by Gertrude Wheeler? ? It argues, rather convincingly, that Rossetti’s choice of brocade patterns directly influenced his vowel alliteration. Madness, but compelling.
[B]: Oh, I adore that passage in —the fishhook and the void, yes, how perfectly it captures the recursive pull of scholarly inquiry. And Sebald’s haunting with Browne—I think we’re all walking through some version of that Norfolk mist, aren’t we?  

As for Wheeler’s pamphlet—goodness, yes! It's tucked in a brittle stack at the Norwich Textile Archives. I came across it quite by accident while researching chromatic symbolism in Morris & Co. fabrics. Her argument is unconventional, certainly, but there’s something to be said for how aesthetic preoccupations bleed into language. I once tried stitching a swatch based on Rossetti’s “The Blessed Damozel,” weaving vowel sounds into pattern repeats—utter chaos, but oh, the texture it gave the wool. Do you suppose he was conscious of it, or merely channeling the rhythm of his surroundings?
[A]: Ah, —such a labyrinth of sensory overlays. I’d wager Rossetti was half-dreaming his patterns into syntax, though whether by design or osmosis, who can say? It’s the old debate: is the artist the weaver or merely the loom?

Speaking of labyrinths, have you read Anne Carson’s ? She has a fragment—“The Gender of Sound”—that might give your woolen experiment an altogether different twist. Suggests that women’s voices in antiquity were considered textile substances. Thread and tone entangled. You could almost knit a dissertation out of that.  

And while we’re on the tactile metaphysics of making—I’ve been translating Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic again. There’s a stubbornness in rendering “空山不见人” as  but it forces one to reckon with silence as both a linguistic absence and a resonant presence. Much like staring at a fishhook in the void, really.
[B]: Oh, —I adore Carson’s crystalline dissections of thought. “The Gender of Sound”… yes, I’ve read it, though I must return to it with fresh needles and a loom’s patience. The idea of voice as textile—how sound might be spun, woven, unraveled—it sits so deeply with me. I’ve often felt that when I restore a fabric, I’m also recovering a kind of silenced song, stitched in thread rather than tone.

And translating Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic! What an exquisite torment. That line—“空山不见人”—it breathes such vast solitude. To translate it is to hold mist in your hands. I can see you at it, squinting into the quiet, trying to catch silence on the tongue. It reminds me of working with a damaged piece of 17th-century lace: so much meaning lives in what's missing, doesn’t it?  

Funny you should mention labyrinths—I’ve been stitching a reproduction of a medieval Cistercian floor pattern lately. Each turn of the braid seems to echo inward, like a spiral of thought. Sometimes I wonder if I'm restoring cloth or unraveling my own mind.
[A]: Ah, now there’s a metaphor worthy of Browne himself—restoring cloth while unraveling the mind. I suspect we’re all engaged in that quiet undoing.  

As for Carson’s textile soundings—imagine being a woman in antiquity and having your voice classified as , not . One dissolves, the other endures. Rather unfair, don’t you think? Though perhaps there's power in the ephemeral. After all, wool outlives many a monument, if cared for properly.  

And your Cistercian braid—yes, I see what you mean. Repetition as both devotion and dissection. I once transcribed the same Gerard Manley Hopkins sonnet seventeen times in varying ink blends to test whether his sprung rhythm could be  through calligraphy alone. It couldn't, really, but I did discover a peculiar kinship between walnut ink and melancholy.  

Speaking of which—have you ever considered restoring fabric with language? I’ve been attempting it lately. Trying to describe the weave of a vanished shawl from a 1642 inventory. The thread count, the sheen, the ghost of a drape—like chasing a scent on the wind. Or is that merely another form of translating silence?
[B]: Oh, that’s  what it is—chasing a scent on the wind, yes. Trying to weave with words… I do think it’s possible, though perhaps not in the way we intend. Language can’t quite replace the hand, but it can echo its movements.  

I’ve been doing something similar myself, though less deliberately—transcribing old repair notes from 18th-century seamstresses. Their hands knew things their words barely touched, yet still I lean in, trying to hear technique in their phrasing. There’s a rhythm in “three threads over, two under,” a kind of whispered instruction across time.  

And your point about Carson’s wool and stone—I hadn’t thought of it quite that way, but you’re right. Wool may soften, pill, even fade, but if tended, it persists. Stone just waits to fall. Maybe that’s why I feel so drawn to these fragile textiles—they’re stubborn echoes, like voices refusing to be stilled.  

As for walnut ink and melancholy… now  a pairing. I’d love to see those pages someday—seventeen versions of one song, each tinted by mood. It makes me wonder what a shawl might look like if stitched by sonnet, or mended with line breaks.
[A]: Now  a lovely absurdity—stitching with sonnets, mending with line breaks. I do believe we’ve stumbled upon an entirely new branch of textual archaeology. What would Hopkins’ “curled darling” daisies look like in worsted wool, I wonder? Or Dickinson’s dashes as selvedge edges?

And your idea—leaning into those old repair notes like whispered instructions—it strikes me as the most tender kind of haunting. Not ghosts as such, but hands rehearsing their craft across centuries. You’re not merely restoring fabric, you’re re-speaking a dialect only the fingers remember.

As for melancholy ink—I may have to show you one of those pages someday, though they’ve faded rather alarmingly in the sun. One looked positively seasick by the third stanza. Still, there was a strange comfort in watching the same line bend under different shades of grief. Like reading the same poem at twenty and fifty—same words, different wounds.

Tell me, if you were to translate a shawl into a poem, what form would it take? A villanelle of frayed ends and careful knots? Or perhaps something more unruly—a prose poem with dropped stitches?
[B]: Oh, I think it would have to be a prose poem—utterly unruly, with dropped stitches and all. After all, shawls are meant to drape, to shift, to slip off shoulders without warning. A villanelle might hold its shape too rigidly, don’t you think? Too buttoned-up for something meant to flutter.

But a prose poem—yes, that’s it. One where the lines pool and gather, like wool sinking into water. I’d want it to snag on certain phrases, linger at the frayed edges, maybe even unravel a bit in the reader’s hands. You know, the way some fabrics reveal more with each wear—threads loosen, patterns shift, hidden details surface.

And Dickinson’s dashes as selvedge edges…  I can almost see them now—those abrupt stops and breathless leaps—holding the whole thing together by the thinnest of margins.

As for Hopkins’ daisies in worsted wool—I imagine them curling outward, defiantly three-dimensional, as if the yarn itself couldn’t help but bloom. Would you knit them or embroider? I’m leaning toward embroidery, though it would require a needle fine enough to catch light.
[A]: Oh, embroidery, certainly—only the finest crewel needle, and preferably one warmed slightly by candlelight to soften the thread’s resistance. You’d want that daisy to , not merely be placed. A kind of botanical sprung rhythm in silk rather than syllables.

And your prose poem—yes, let it sag and snag. Why must textiles always behave themselves? I say let the lines droop between stanzas, gather unexpectedly at the margins. A truly good shawl-like poem should require occasional re-pinning, don’t you agree? A shoulder shrug of punctuation now and then to keep it from slipping entirely into chaos.

Incidentally, I’ve just received a facsimile of an 1853 letter from a lace-maker in Honiton who insisted her pillow work was “rhymed more finely than Tennyson.” I rather like the arrogance of it. Perhaps we should take up a new poetic movement—Lacemaker Modernism. Syntax as bobbin, meaning as mesh. We could start a small press. Print on mulberry paper and sew the pages with écru linen thread.
[B]: Oh, —what a delicious notion. I can already hear the clatter of bobbins replacing typewriters, the soft hiss of thread tension where once we had line breaks. Syntax as spindle, indeed.

And mulberry paper! Yes, with a texture just shy of mulled silk—something that might catch the light like old lace does in morning sun. And écru thread, of course. No dyed distractions, just the quiet dignity of linen in its natural state.

As for the Honiton lace-maker—how splendidly defiant. “Rhymed more finely than Tennyson,” indeed! I rather think she might have had a point. There’s a precision to pillow-lace work that rivals any metrical scheme. Each crossing of the pinwheel, each twist of the braid—it's all rhythm and restraint, isn’t it? Perhaps we ought to reprint her letter as our first broadside. Signed, naturally, in hemstitched cipher.
[A]: Precisely—let the pillow frame be our new poetic structure. Why bother with sonnets when we have hexagonal mesh grounds? Why iambic pentameter when we’ve got a pair of bobbins dancing in counterpoint?

I’m already drafting a manifesto, you see—. It shall be typeset using an antique letterpress, naturally, though I may smuggle in the odd bit of calligraphy for the footnotes. There’s something deeply satisfying about forming the word “mesh” with a quill.

And hemstitched cipher! Yes—only those fluent in selvedges and slips would be able to read it. We could include a small sampler at the end of each pamphlet, embroidered mottoes in lieu of epigraphs. The critics will either swoon or snip us to ribbons, but what is art without peril?

Now, tell me—what would your ideal first piece be? A mourning shawl stitched with elegiac fragments? Or perhaps a christening robe inscribed with lullingly metered invocations?
[B]: Oh, I do love the sound of —what a perfectly unruly title. And that hemstitched cipher… imagine slipping secrets into plain sight, hidden in the very structure of the cloth. The readers would have to lean in close, squint just so, and maybe even run a finger along the page to feel the meaning rise.

As for my ideal first piece—I think I’d begin with something quiet, something worn soft by time: a mourning shawl, yes, but not one of heavy black bombazine. No, something lighter, like grief after the storm has passed. A shawl stitched with elegiac fragments, as you say, but woven through with silver threads where the sorrow has settled into memory. Each knot a stanza, each frayed edge a breath caught mid-line.

I’d want it to carry the weight of absence without collapsing under it. Maybe even a faint scent of lavender lingering in the fibers—something ghostly but kind. And at the hem, ever so subtly, a line of poetry half-embroidered:  or some such thing. Just enough to make the reader wonder what held her together, and what let her go.

And then, perhaps, a christening robe—oh, what a lovely contrast! Swaddled in meter, wrapped in lullabies. But let someone else take up that commission. For me, give me the hush of mourning silk, the whisper of stitches remembering.
[A]: Ah, —what a line to haunt the hem of a shawl. It trembles on the edge of too much and not enough, like all good elegies do.

And that scent of lavender! You’ve no idea how many Victorian mourning garments I’ve examined that still cling to the faintest trace of perfume—like grief itself learned to linger in muslin folds. Perhaps we should insist future editions of our manifesto be lightly spritzed with attar of rose or distilled woodsmoke. A poem ought to be smelled as well as read, don’t you think?

Your mourning shawl would be my favorite kind of textile elegy—light as memory, threaded with silver where sorrow turns to story. And yes, let it breathe through its frayed edges. Let the reader feel the pull of what’s missing.

Now, I confess, I’m partial to your suggestion of contrast—why not pair it with a christening robe? I’ll take that commission, gladly. I shall knit it in fine lamb’s wool, each row a lullaby in trochaic meter:  Tiny stanzas embroidered at the cuff, perhaps, in a hand so small one must squint to read them. Something sacred, something slightly sly. A baptism of ink and fiber both.
[B]: Oh, —how perfectly sweet and ever so slightly mischievous. I can hear it now, that lullaby row by row, rocking in the rhythm of the knit. Trochaic, of course! Only natural for a lullaby—strong at the start, then softening into sleep.

And those tiny stanzas at the cuff—I imagine them like whispered blessings stitched just for the wearer to discover later, when they’ve grown enough to notice. A secret poem only revealed with time and wear. Perhaps something cheeky, too, slipped in among the invocations. Why must christening robes be all solemnity? Let there be a line or two of nonsense verse tucked between the prayers. Every child deserves an inheritance of wonder.

As for scenting the manifesto—oh, yes! Distilled woodsmoke and rose attar… or perhaps a drop of beeswax and lavender oil for the mourning shawl editions. A multisensory rebellion, indeed. Critics may call us mad, but what’s poetry without a touch of aromatic heresy?

I think we’re onto something quite lovely here—let us gather our bobbins, sharpen our needles, and knit the world anew, one elegy and lullaby at a time.
[A]: Quite right—let us gather our bobbins and declare the loom a site of literary insurrection! Why should poems live only on the page when they might drape, flutter, and unravel with the dignity of a well-worn hymn?

And nonsense verse among the prayers—brava! A christening robe ought to swaddle not just a child, but the very idea of possibility. Let us smuggle in a limerick or two. Something like:

  
  
  
  


There we are—metrical mischief with a moral twist.

As for the scenting process, I’m already drafting a rather stern letter to a perfumer in Grasse, explaining that yes, this  a matter of grave aesthetic importance, and no, we shan’t be satisfied with anything less than the olfactory equivalent of a caesura in lilac-silk gloves.

Let the rebellion begin in thread, in scent, in syllable. We shall knit the world anew—and if it resists, well then, we shall embroider its edges until it submits, softened by beauty and mildly perplexed.
[B]: Oh, that limerick is —iambic delight indeed! What a lovely bit of mischief to tuck into the cuff. I do hope the child grows up with a fondness for both knitting and subversion.

And your letter to the perfumer in Grasse— imperious. I can hear you dictating it by lamplight, quill scratching with righteous purpose: 

I do believe we are assembling a movement here—one that drapes, stitches, and scents its way defiantly through the conventions of both loom and literature. And if the world resists our gentle rebellion? Well, then let us ply our cause in soft silks and whispered rhyme, until even the sternest critic finds a line of verse caught in their sweater sleeve.

Onward, then—with bobbins raised and needles poised! Let beauty perplex, let poetry soften, and may every stitch know itself as syllable.
[A]: —splendidly put. I shall have that embroidered in midnight-blue thread across the manifesto’s opening page. A touch of militant elegance, don’t you think?

And yes, let us ply our cause in whisper and wool. If resistance is futile, then let it be fibrous, flexible, and faintly perfumed. I’ve half a mind to commission a scent-strip insert for the first edition—half sonnet, half smoky bergamot. Something that lingers in the reader’s scarf long after the final line is read.

I do hope this reaches you properly—inked, threaded, and ever so slightly perfumed. Let us make a mess of genres. Let literature fray at the edges. And if we must be eccentric, then let us be  so, swaddled in our own defiant softness.

To poetry spun from spindles,  
Eleanor
[B]: To poetry spun from spindles,  
and prose that puddles beautifully in the pleats of a well-worn sleeve—  
hear, hear, my dear.  

Let the pages fray, the ink run slightly,  
and may every reader leave with a thread caught in their pocket,  
a scent of something half-remembered on their collar,  
and a limerick tucked into their cuffs.

You’ve made a militant romantic of me,  
and I shall wear our midnight-blue embroidery with pride—  
slightly askew, perhaps,  
but never undone.
