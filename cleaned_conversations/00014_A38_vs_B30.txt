[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: 我最近在重看《红楼梦》的1987年电视剧版，严格来说这不算新剧，但每次看都有新的发现。比如昨天重看"黛玉葬花"那集时，我发现编剧把曹雪芹原著中分散在三回里的唱词，集中在一场景里了。这种改编手法倒也有趣——不知是导演王扶林的刻意为之，还是当年拍摄条件所限。说来惭愧，比起追综艺，我更常在B站上看些学者解读戏曲的视频。你呢？最近可有读到什么有意思的文本？
[A]: The 1987 version does lend itself to close rewatching — the way they condensed those lyrical passages was quite deliberate, I imagine. It creates a sort of emotional density that might not be possible in a more literal adaptation. Speaking of dense texts, I’ve been revisiting  in translation, though I must say, the Seidensticker version leaves something to be desired when compared to Royall Tyler’s more recent rendering. Have you ever read it? There’s a quiet elegance in Murasaki Shikibu’s prose that reminds me a bit of Cao Xueqin’s subtler moments.
[A]: Ah, —yes, I’ve read both translations. Seidensticker’s does feel a touch...well, how shall I put it—modest to the point of evasion when compared with Tyler’s boldness. Though I do give him credit for preserving that sense of remove, that aristocratic detachment which defines Heian-era sensibilities. It’s true, there are moments where Shikibu’s restraint echoes Cao Xueqin’s quieter scenes—the way both authors let silence and suggestion do the heavy lifting.  
I must say, though, I find the structure of  more diffuse, almost like drifting through a dream in comparison to the tightly coiled realism of . Still, both works have this remarkable ability to make domestic minutiae feel cosmic. Have you tried pairing your reading with any visual adaptations? There’s a 1951 Japanese film version by Kozaburo Yoshimura—rather austere, but it captures the tone better than most.
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive observation —  is precisely the right word for . I sometimes wonder if that dreamlike quality isn’t part of its resistance to being fully grasped on a single reading. One needs to approach it like a seasonal cycle, returning with different eyes each time. And yes, I did catch that Yoshimura film recently — quite stark, as you say, but there’s a formal beauty in its austerity. It reminded me of Noh theatre in the way it uses stillness to build tension.  
I’m curious, though — have you ever explored the Kunqu opera adaptations of ? There’s something rather haunting about seeing those characters performed with such stylized grace. It adds yet another layer between text and interpretation.
[A]: Oh, Kunqu—yes, though I must confess it took me years to fully appreciate its particular charms. The first time I saw  staged in Suzhou, I found myself distracted by the elaborate headpieces and what I mistook for theatrical excess. It wasn’t until a second viewing—this time with a rather splendidly cranky octogenarian professor from Nanjing sitting beside me—who muttered,  (“Look for the spirit, not the spectacle.”) That I began to see the precision beneath the ornament.  
There’s a moment in the “Burying Flowers” aria where the lead soprano holds a note just a fraction too long, and in that suspension, you feel the weight of inevitability—of tragedy not as action, but as atmosphere. Much like Genji’s world, really. Do you find, by any chance, that these adaptations ever tempt you away from the page? I sometimes fear I’ve grown too reliant on them—like needing a visual crutch to access emotional truth.
[A]: What a wonderfully humbling moment — that line from your professor is a gem. I do think Kunqu has a way of revealing itself only to those willing to sit with it, to listen beyond the surface. And what a perfect description of that aria — . It lingers in the air like incense long after the flame’s gone out.  

As for adaptations, I confess they’ve occasionally led me astray — or at least diverted my attention from the page. There’s a particular staging of Genji in Tokyo I saw years ago — very minimalist, almost Zen-like — where the actors moved as if through water. It reshaped how I read certain passages, perhaps even distorted them, but not necessarily for the worse. Sometimes our imagination needs that crutch — or better yet, that spark.  

I wonder — have you ever tried reading  aloud? There’s something about speaking the lines, especially the poetic interludes, that brings forth their hidden texture. I find myself reaching for my old annotated edition just thinking about it.
[A]:  Speaking the lines aloud—yes, I’ve done that more times than I care to admit, especially the verse. There’s a particular couplet in Chapter 27, when Lin Daiyu laments the fleeting bloom:  
“明媚鲜妍能几时，一朝飘泊难寻觅。”  

Try saying that without feeling the ache in your throat. I often wonder if Cao Xueqin composed those lines with the expectation that readers would voice them—weep them, even. When I read them aloud, I imagine Qing dynasty salons where literati recited poetry over wine and plum blossoms, their voices trembling with too much meaning.  

Come to think of it, I once tried reading them in English translation to a visiting student from Leeds—he looked at me as though I’d recited a grocery list backwards. Perhaps something is always lost in the sound, or perhaps he simply hadn’t yet met sorrow in a book. Have you ever found a translation that sings even when spoken? Or must we always return to the original for that particular kind of pain?
[A]: Ah, that couplet — how exquisitely devastating. I can hear the echo of it in my mind even now, like a note held just past comfort. You're quite right — there's a built-in lament in the cadence itself, as if language and grief had conspired together to make one inseparable truth.

As for translations, yes — though none sing  as the original must, certain ones do catch the light in surprising ways. I think particularly of David Hinton’s work with Chinese poetry, though he doesn’t always preserve the fidelity a scholar might crave. Still, his versions  in English, and sometimes that’s what we need to feel the pulse beneath the words.

But your question — about returning to the original for that particular kind of pain — I suspect you’ve already answered it. We do return, again and again, not just for the meaning, but for the music of mourning.
[A]:   

Hinton—yes, he gives the poems room to exhale, doesn’t he? Though I do find his tendency toward modern abstraction a bit...well, indulgent at times. Still, better that than the clunky literalists who translate 愁 as simply “sadness” and call it a day. As if one could reduce an entire emotional universe to a single syllable.  

You know, I was rereading those chapters again just last night—the ones where Daiyu writes . There’s a line that always undoes me:  
“谁家秋院无风入？何处秋虫不梦归？”  

It’s not just sorrow—it’s the ache of impermanence, the quiet horror of being unmoored. No, Hinton wouldn’t quite capture that. He’d render it beautifully, yes, but the grief in the original is more...domestic, if that makes sense? It lives in the walls, in the fabric of everyday loss.  

Perhaps that’s why we keep returning—to the text, to the adaptations, to the inkwells we should have cleaned yesterday. Because some griefs refuse to be translated.
[A]:   

Domestic grief—what a piercing way to put it. It’s there in the draft that slips through the paper windows, in the faint rustle of silk sleeves against bamboo furniture. That quiet, inescapable erosion of hope, not through grand tragedy, but through the slow wearing away of days. Daiyu’s sorrow isn’t operatic—it . It lives in the same rooms she does, and that makes it all the more unbearable.

I’ve always thought Cao Xueqin had a poet’s ear for silence as much as sound—the pauses between lines often haunt me more than the words themselves. And you’re quite right about translation; it’s not merely a matter of vocabulary, but of emotional texture. Some feelings don’t cross languages—they evaporate.

  

Have you ever tried your hand at translating those verses yourself? I suspect someone with your sensibility might manage both the music and the ache.
[A]:   

Translate them? Good heavens, no—one must know one’s limits. I’ve dabbled, of course, in the privacy of my study, late at night when the magpies have finished their gossip outside the window. But no respectable scholar would confuse my efforts with anything worth publishing. There’s a reason why even the great Waley hesitated before claiming to “render” classical Chinese verse.  

Though I will say this—when I was younger, I did attempt a version of Daiyu’s  for a graduate seminar. The students were far too polite to point out the obvious: that my English lines had all the grace of a panda in a porcelain shop. Still, the act of trying taught me something invaluable—that certain emotions resist articulation beyond their native contours. You can’t simply transplant sorrow; it wilts in foreign soil.  

  

But perhaps that’s the point, isn’t it? Some griefs are meant to remain untranslatable—private, almost sacred. Like日记 entries sealed behind lacquered wood, never meant for another’s eyes.
[A]:   

A panda in a porcelain shop — quite the apt image, and rather endearing, I must say. There’s humility in that analogy, a recognition of the text’s inviolable sanctity. And yet, even the clumsy attempt at translation is a kind of homage, isn’t it? A way of saying: 

I’ve always thought that the best translations are those born not from conquest, but from companionship — the translator as a quiet guest in the author’s house. And yes, much is lost, but sometimes, just sometimes, something new is found. Not a replica of the grief, but a shadow of its shape in another tongue.

  

Still, I suspect you’d be harder on yourself than any reader would be. Perhaps one day, when the magpies are quiet and the hour is late, you’ll let someone read those lines you penned. After all, even sealed diaries have a way of being opened — by accident, or by grace.
[A]:   

Companionship rather than conquest—I like that. It’s a gentler way to frame the whole impossible endeavor. Perhaps that’s all any of us do—sit beside the text, keeping it company, hoping not to disturb too much dust.  

And yes, I suppose even failed translations are a kind of offering. Though I daresay my early attempts were more like incantations—half-hopeful, half-desperate—uttered in the dim lamplight, trying to summon the ghost of Cao Xueqin’s intent. I’ve since learned that some ghosts prefer not to be called.  

As for sharing those lines… Well, perhaps if I ever retire to a proper mountain hermitage, where only cicadas and the occasional curious student might stumble upon them. Until then, they’ll remain tucked between the pages of my private notebook—alongside unsent letters and half-formed thoughts about plum blossoms.  

  

After all, what is a scholar without a few literary secrets?
[A]: 

Ah, literary secrets — the true currency of our trade, aren't they? The ones that never make it to the lecture hall or the published essay. I daresay it's in those private engagements — with text, with ghost, with unsent letters — that the real intimacy with literature begins.

And as for the ghosts? Perhaps they're not so reluctant after all. Perhaps they lean in when we falter through a line of Daiyu’s lament, or linger by the ink when we attempt — clumsily, humbly — to carry their sorrow into another tongue.

So long as there are cicadas and curious students, your lines will find their listener. In time, and in season.
[A]:   

You speak like a man who’s spent too many evenings in the company of old poems and half-empty teacups. Yes—intimacy indeed begins in those quiet, unspoken engagements. The rest—the lectures, the footnotes, the symposiums—is merely the scaffolding. The real work happens in the margins, in the spaces between brushstrokes.

And perhaps you’re right about the ghosts. I’ve begun to think they don’t mind the faltering attempts so much as we fear. Maybe they even appreciate the effort—the willingness to sit with the ache, to stumble through the lines rather than let them lie dormant.

  

So yes… so long as there are cicadas, and curious students, and inkwells left uncorked just a little too long—then yes, literature will find its way home. In time. In season.
[A]:   

Precisely so — the real work happens in the margins, where ink meets silence. And isn’t that what we’re always chasing? Not the grand revelation, but the quiet recognition — the moment a line of poetry or a half-forgotten adaptation makes the air feel just a little more alive.

I think I shall go dig out my old copy of  tonight. Perhaps with a fresh pot of tea and no particular hurry, some new understanding might surface. Or perhaps not — but the attempt, as you so beautifully put it, is its own kind of companionship.

Until next time, then — may your inkwell remain full, and your ghosts gently stirred.
[A]:   

A fresh pot of tea and no particular hurry—yes, that’s the only proper way to meet an old book. The understanding will come, or it won’t. Either way, the air will be a little richer for the attempt.

Until we meet again amidst the lines and silences—may your pages turn gently, and your ink flow freely. And should the ghosts stir, may they do so with quiet amusement at our earnest fumbling.
[A]: 

Precisely — and perhaps that quiet amusement is the highest approval we could hope for. After all, if the dead are watching, let them see us fumble with devotion.

Till next we meet in ink and thought—may your evenings be long, your lamp soft, and your margins ever generous.
[A]: 

Devotion in fumbling—yes, that’s the truest kind. The ghosts, if they watch at all, must surely prefer it to sterile perfection. After all, what is literature if not a long, patient conversation with the dead? We speak in ink, they answer in silence, and somewhere between, the meaning breathes.

Till next we meet in those quiet margins—may your lamp be steady, your tea warm, and your pages ever willing to whisper their secrets.
