[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有在关注一些有意思的餐厅呢！不过我更好奇你平时喜欢什么类型的料理呀？是更偏爱本地特色还是异国风味？
[A]: Oh, I love this question! You know, working in film often takes me to the most unexpected places around the globe — and food is always part of the adventure. I’ve developed a real taste for bold, layered flavors that tell a story — kind of like a well-written script. 

I used to be all about the local classics when I was younger — nothing beats a perfectly made pastrami sandwich from Canter’s Deli after a long night shoot. But lately? I find myself craving something deeper than just comfort. Have you ever tried that Sichuan spot on Melrose? The mapo tofu there hits with the same intensity as a Tarantino climax — fiery, flavorful, and unforgettable. 

What about you? Any favorite cuisines that really speak to your senses?
[B]: That sounds like a flavor-packed journey indeed! I’m totally into how food can tell stories and evoke emotions — almost like designing user experiences, where every detail contributes to the overall narrative.  

You know, since I work in tech, I often end up surrounded by the same café chains, but I’ve been making it my mission to hunt down those under-the-radar spots. There’s this tiny Burmese place tucked behind a laundromat that I stumbled on last month — the flavors are so rich yet balanced, like a symphony in your mouth. Have you ever tried Burmese cuisine? It’s seriously underrated.  

And hey, I’m all for bold flavors too — especially when they come with a bit of heat! But what I really love is discovering ingredients or techniques that surprise me, you know? Like when you think you’ve tasted everything and then  — something completely new hits your palate.  

So, do you usually go for that intense spice level, or do you prefer something more subtle but complex?
[A]: Oh, I love that you mentioned Burmese — yes, I’ve had some incredible mohinga and tea leaf salad in London’s Little Burma before. Such a hidden culinary gem, really. Those flavors are like a well-kept secret — once you taste them, you can’t believe more people haven’t discovered them yet.

You’re absolutely right about food and emotion — sometimes, a single bite can transport you. I remember shooting in Bangkok years ago, and there was this street vendor who made the most delicate tom kha gai from a tiny cart. You’d walk up, point, and five minutes later — magic. That balance of sour, sweet, salty? It’s like cinematic perfection.  

As for spice — I’ll go all-in when the dish earns it. If the heat is just for shock value, count me out. But when it builds like a third act twist, oh man, I’m there. I once ordered what looked like a simple eggplant dish in Chengdu — turned out it was laced with ghost pepper. Took three Tsingtaos and a sesame ball to recover… but totally worth it.  

So, if we were to team up — you with your tech palette and me with my director’s eye — we could open a place that’s equal parts sensory experience and narrative journey. Imagine a tasting menu where each course is paired with a short film. What would your dream collaboration look like?
[B]: Oh wow, I’m already getting goosebumps just imagining it — a full sensory narrative arc from bite to frame! 🎥🍲 That ChengDU story though — ghost pepper?! Okay, you’ve got serious spice stamina 😅 But yeah, heat with intention is everything. It’s like pacing in a film — if it hits too early or feels forced, the whole experience loses its impact.

I’d love weaving that kind of storytelling into a dining concept. Honestly, my dream collab would be something immersive — not just a meal, but a journey where every ingredient has a backstory and every flavor note plays a role. Picture this: diners walk through a space designed like a UI/UX flow (my comfort zone 😂), each room a different sensory chapter. Maybe start with a minimalist amuse-bouche paired with silence, then build into a layered main course synced with a crescendoing score.  

And yes, short films could introduce each dish — almost like director’s commentary, but edible! What if one course was inspired by Wong Kar-wai’s visual poetry, all saturated hues and slow-motion texture? Or something Scorsese-level intense, with rich layers and sudden bursts of umami-fire 🔥

So, what city do you think would be the ultimate backdrop for this experiment — LA’s creative chaos, NYC’s rhythm, or some place totally unexpected?
[A]: Oh, I can  the potential already — this is the kind of bold, boundary-pushing concept that gets my producer instincts humming. That Wong Kar-wai course you mentioned? Yes, please — slow-motion silk tofu bathed in amber light, maybe a hint of osmanthus and star anise, while Shigeru Umebayashi’s “Yumeji’s Theme” wraps around your senses like smoke… cinematic seduction on a plate.

As for location — forget the obvious choices. Don’t get me wrong, LA has its magic, and yes, we’ve got every cuisine under the sun here, but what this concept needs is contrast, something disruptive. Imagine launching this in a city where people  tradition — like Kyoto or Istanbul — and then completely rewire their relationship with flavor and narrative. Or even better… Marrakech. Think about it: the spice markets, the rhythm of the streets, the way light falls at dusk over Jemaa el-Fnaa — it's storytelling gold. We could build it like a labyrinth, each course pulling you deeper into a tale that feels ancient and futuristic at once.

And hey, if we pull this off, we’re not just opening a restaurant — we’re creating a genre. Call it . What do you say? Ready to co-write the first scene?
[B]: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. 🎬✨

 — I’m already scribbling that in my notebook with heart emojis. It’s perfect. Totally genre-defining.

Okay, so if we’re launching this in Marrakech (genius call, by the way), I’m imagining the entrance feels like stepping into a reel of old film stock — grainy light, flickering shadows, maybe a scent diffuser with a whisper of saffron and fire-roasted cumin to set the mood before the first bite even hits.

Let’s build our opening scene around contrast — like the way a close-up can feel both intimate and overwhelming. First course: preserved lemon tagine foam served on a warm stone, paired with a black-and-white short film of a spice vendor arranging his wares in slow motion. Every grain of cumin tells a story. Every drip of oil is a plot twist.

And then… we ramp up the saturation. Midway through the menu, we hit them with color, heat, rhythm — maybe a dish inspired by harira soup but deconstructed into edible "film strips" that you assemble on a miniature light table. Boom — interactive flavor editing 😂 And the film shifts from silent to sound, like when  goes from sepia to full Technicolor.

So, what would your signature dish-film pairing be? Something that makes people lean forward in their seats like it’s the final act twist?
[A]: Oh, I’m  — you just elevated this from a meal to a full-on sensory screenplay. That scent diffuser idea? Pure genius. You’re not just serving food — you’re directing atmosphere.

Alright, for my signature act — let’s go full . Picture this: the last course in a pitch-black room, where guests can’t see their own hands until the film begins. On screen? A close-up of an old Moroccan storyteller whispering in Darija — subtitles fade in like smoke. Then, slowly, light creeps in… and on the table appears a dish that looks almost empty, like negative space — but when you taste it? Boom. Layers of flavor unfold like a twist you didn’t see coming.

It’s called . A deconstructed msemen pancake with saffron crème anglaise and a single preserved orange chip that crackles like film grain when you bite into it. The final sip? A thimble of spiced mint tea reduction — hot, sweet, sharp — like the emotional gut-punch of a perfectly timed fade-out.

And here’s the kicker: after the last bite, the lights come up and everyone sees each other for the first time. Strangers who’ve shared the same silent journey — just like in a movie theater. That’s the moment you realize the real story wasn’t on the screen or on the plate... it was in the silence between bites.

So, what do we call this menu arc? Something that feels like poetry. Like ? Or maybe something simpler... ?
[B]: Okay, I’m literally clutching my chest —  is perfection. It captures exactly what we’re doing here: turning flavor into feeling, heat into memory, texture into truth. Every bite reveals something hidden in the glow.

And your  concept? Chills. That’s the kind of dish that doesn’t just linger on the palate — it stays with you, like a scene you replay in your head long after the credits roll.

I want to end the menu with a physical echo too — something guests take with them. Maybe a small takeaway: a flash-frozen rosewater & orange blossom candy in a tiny film canister. They pop it in their mouth later, unexpectedly, and boom — the whole journey comes rushing back. Like a post-credits scene you didn’t see coming 😍

So now that we’ve basically reinvented dining as cinema… how do we cast our first screening? Do we start underground, invite a few taste-makers (literally), or go full guerrilla style and surprise people in unexpected places — like inside an old theater that's been shuttered for decades?

And hey, if this takes off... do we open a second location? Or do we stay elusive, like a secret film festival that only happens once a year? 🎥🌶️
[A]: Oh, I love how your mind works — that rose-in-a-canister idea? Pure storytelling alchemy. It’s like Hitchcock in a bonbon… you’re not just leaving with a sugar rush, you’re walking out with a plot twist in your pocket.

For casting the first screening — underground, . No press, no pomp, just a carefully curated guest list of flavor-seekers, indie filmmakers, and maybe one or two Michelin-starred rebels who still believe in the art of surprise. We leak nothing online — this isn’t Instagram food, it’s . Imagine inviting someone like Wes Anderson just to see if he’d request a symmetrical plating layout 😄

And the venue? Let’s go rogue. Picture an abandoned cinema in downtown Cairo — dust-covered velvet seats, cracked projection room above, flickering ghosts of old Arabic films still clinging to the air. We don’t fix it up — we lean into the decay. Guests walk through the lobby lined with vintage film reels infused with spice notes — they get to “smell the scene” before they even sit down.

As for what comes next? If this resonates — if people show up changed, quiet,  by flavor — then yes, we keep it elusive. Not a chain, not a brand… more like a cinematic cult with great taste buds. Maybe once a year, in a different city, announced only through coded messages on hand-written menus. Like a secret film festival, but edible. You in? 🎬🌶️🍿
[B]: Oh my god, I’m already drafting the invitation — no pixels allowed, just ink-stamped cards with a single scent strip on the back that smells like popcorn and cardamom. 🔥 If Wes Anderson shows up and asks for color-coordinated cutlery, I’m handing him a fork dipped in saffron gold and saying “trust the process.”

Cairo? Abandoned cinema? Yes, yes, and YES. The atmosphere alone would be a character in the story. I can already picture guests stepping over faded ticket stubs and peeling posters, not knowing whether they’re about to watch a film or  And us, hiding behind dusty curtains, watching flavor and nostalgia hit like a plot twist.

I’m in — 100%, soul-and-sense-level in. Let’s build this cinematic cult of taste. One secret screening. One unforgettable bite. One whispered recommendation at a time.

Now, when do we start scouting locations? 😎🍿🌶️
[A]: I’m already drafting the scout list — first stop: Cairo. I’ve got a contact who knows a projectionist-turned-chef with ties to an old art deco theater there. Fingers crossed, because if we can get that space? We don’t just open a door — we reopen a .

Let’s hit the ground in early spring. Beat the heat, catch the city in that golden haze where everything feels slightly dreamlit. We’ll bring a small crew — trusted palates and sharp eyes — and maybe test the concept with a soft preview screening. Tiny group, big impact. Like the first table read of a script no one’s seen yet.

And hey, we’ll make it a ritual — every scouting trip starts with a shared meal at a local hole-in-the-wall. No phones, no pitch decks, just us tuning into the flavor rhythm of the place. Because if we’re going to build a menu like this, we’ve got to  the story first.

Pack your bags, partner. This isn’t just dinner. It’s director’s cut dining. 🎬🌶️📍
[B]: I’m already checking flights and sketching menu-test ideas in the margins of my notebook — yes,  is the vibe. No shortcuts, no filler scenes. Just pure, uncut flavor narrative.

Count me in for that scouting trip — and I  the idea of starting every journey with a hole-in-the-wall meal. No distractions, just us and the local flavor pulse. It’s how we’ll find those unsung ingredients that nobody’s spotlighted yet. The kind of stuff that becomes legend on the plate.

Golden haze in Cairo, here we come. Let’s pack light but eat deep. And definitely bring extra space in our suitcases — for spices, memories, and maybe a few stolen theater seats 🎥🍴✨

Let me know when the crew’s set — I’ve got a feeling this is going to be the best script we’ve ever co-written.
[A]: Oh, I can already taste the dust and spices in the air — this is going to be more than a meal. It’s going to be a .

I’ll lock in the crew this week — my go-to cinematographer who eats with his eyes first, a sound designer who swears he can “hear the depth of a dish,” and of course, us — the two fools who thought flavor could rival film. And honestly? I think we’re onto something bigger than either of us imagined.

Let’s not just find ingredients — let’s chase the ones that have been hiding in plain sight, waiting for someone to tell their story. A forgotten herb from a Cairo market. A clay pot technique passed down through generations. The kind of stuff that doesn’t make it onto a menu unless you’ve lived it.

And yeah, steal a seat or two from that theater — call it set dressing, call it a souvenir, call it . We’re not just building a dining experience here. We’re resurrecting atmosphere, one bite at a time.

I’ll send flight options soon. Let’s hit Cairo like auteurs with appetites. This is our first scene — and I have a feeling the Academy’s never tasted anything like it. 🎥🍴✨🍿
[B]: Oh,  is the perfect word — because this isn’t something you just eat. It’s something you , something you carry with you. And I’m here for every visceral, unforgettable bite.

Bringing the cinematographer and sound designer into the kitchen? Chef’s kiss meets director’s cut — seriously, who else thinks about layering flavor profiles like a film score? I can already picture your sound guy closing his eyes after a taste and saying, “I hear bass notes in the cumin.”

Let’s not just tell stories — let’s make them edible, immersive, unforgettable. That forgotten herb in Cairo? We’re going to turn it into a legend. That clay pot? The lead actor of our second course.

And yes — steal those theater seats. If we're resurrecting atmosphere, we might as well sit in the ghosts of stories past while we plan our own.

Cairo, get ready. We’re coming with hungry hearts and big dreams. 🎥🍴✨🌶️

Hit me with those flight options — I’ve got passports ready and a suitcase full of curiosity. Let’s make history taste damn good.
[A]: You just gave me chills — , huh? That should be our production company slogan. Or better yet, embroidered on the inside of every apron: 

I’m telling you, when we land in Cairo, it’s going to hit like that moment when the lights dim and the music swells — that split second before the first frame hits the screen. And we’re not just going to observe this city, we’re going to  its soul. Bite by bite, note by note.

And hey, if my sound guy says “bass notes” one more time, I’m giving him a wooden spoon and putting him on plating duty. We’ll see how he balances treble tones with tahini.

Flight options are coming — and trust me, I’m booking us into places where the Wi-Fi password is scribbled on the back of a spice jar. This isn’t a trip. It’s pre-production for the most flavorful film set ever built.

Let’s do this. Let’s make the world taste in color again. 🎥🌶️🍴✈️🍿
[B]: Yes.  “Serve like you’re stealing the scene” — I want that whispered like a mantra in every kitchen we build. Hell, I’ll tattoo it on my wrist next to my compass rose. ⚔️✨

And ? That’s exactly what this is. We’re not just hunting flavors — we’re chasing ghosts, memories, the kind of taste that lingers long after the plate is empty. Like baklava dust in your fingertips or the hum of a street vendor’s chant stuck in your head.

I cannot wait for that moment when we step off the plane and everything hits at once — the heat, the scent of roasting lamb from a rooftop grill, the distant call to prayer layered over honking cabs. It’s going to be cinematic chaos and I’m here to devour it all.

Can’t wait to get those flight details — and yes, book me into the kind of place where breakfast comes with mint tea and a side of local legends. Wi-Fi password on a spice jar? Perfection. We’ll be too busy scribbling flavor pairings on napkins to check our email anyway.

Let’s make the world taste in color again — one hidden gem at a time. 🎥🌶️🍴✈️🍿  
I’m ready. Let’s roll.
[A]: You, my friend, were born for this.

I can already see it — you standing in the middle of a Cairo spice market, eyes closed, nose deep in a blend that smells like a secret passed down through generations. And me, scribbling notes on a torn piece of papyrus-looking paper, pretending it’s a script draft when really it’s just a napkin from yesterday’s falafel stand.

This is where magic happens — not in studios or test kitchens, but in the heat and pulse of a city that never stops telling stories. We’re not tourists. We’re flavor detectives with passports and palates wide open.

And about that compass rose tattoo — seriously, I’m picturing it now:   

Flight details are on their way. First stop: cinematic chaos. Second stop: legend-making. Third? The world’s most unforgettable tasting menu.

Pack your sense of wonder — and maybe a few empty jars for spices you’ll never find back home.

Cairo’s waiting. Let’s make it the opening scene of something unforgettable. 🎥🌶️🍴✈️🍿

I’ll see you on the other side of the spice rack.
[B]: You just made my heart do a full cinematic pan-and-scan — slow motion, dramatic lighting, emotional score swell. ✨

I can  it already — the warmth of cardamom hitting like golden-hour light, the tang of preserved lime cutting through the air like a perfectly timed line of dialogue. And yes, I’ll be the one shamelessly sniffing every jar like I’m decoding an ancient script. Some people collect postcards — I’m coming home with a suitcase full of scent memories.

Flavor detectives with passports? I’ll take that title over any Oscar. 🕵️‍♀️🌶️ We’re not just chasing tastes — we’re tracking down the soul of a place, one bite at a time.

And don’t even get me started on that compass rose line — I might actually embroider it onto my travel tote.  Yes. That’s not just a motto. That’s a 

I’m ready — senses sharpened, curiosity cranked to eleven. Let’s make Cairo the opening scene of something legendary.

See you on the other side of the spice rack. 💃🕺🎥🍴🔥
