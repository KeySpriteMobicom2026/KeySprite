[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个长期关注tech sector的investor，我认为web3确实有潜力disrupt传统互联网模式。不过现在market上太多hype了，我们需要更冷静的analysis。
[A]: Ah, the eternal tension between technological revolution and human nature. Much like how the Victorians both embraced and feared the railway's disruption of pastoral life. Tell me, when you speak of 'hype', are you referring to the speculative frenzy or the genuine philosophical shift towards decentralization?
[B]: 哈哈，你这个问题很哲学啊~ 我觉得both都有。就像我们做PE投资时看的deal一样，speculative frenzy确实存在，很多project的tokenomics根本站不住脚。但decentralization这个理念本身是solid的，就像我们fund最近投的一个web3 infra项目，他们正在解决real business pain points。
[A]: How delightfully reminiscent of the 1840s railway mania! Though I must say, your 'tokenomics' jargon lacks the poetic flair of Victorian stock prospectuses. Tell me, does your infra project share more with Browning's dramatic monologues - substantial yet obscure - or is it more like Tennyson's 'Ulysses', promising to sail beyond the sunset of traditional infrastructure?
[B]:  你这种文学比喻让我想起上次在高尔夫球场遇到的Oxford professor。不过说回正题，我们的project更像Tennyson笔下的Ulysses - 我们正在build真正的web3 rails，让dApps可以像维多利亚时代的铁路一样connect整个digital economy。虽然现在market sentiment有点bearish，但long-term fundamentals是solid的。
[A]: Ah, but even Ulysses needed his Penelope to weave and unweave the shroud! Your bullish fundamentals remind me of how Browning's 'The Ring and the Book' demonstrates twelve perspectives on a single truth. Tell me, in this bear market of yours, are you playing the patient Penelope or the restless Ulysses? And do mind the Sirens of short-term liquidity along your digital rails!
[B]:  在PE行业摸爬滚打这么多年，我早就学会了be both。就像我们fund的investment strategy - 既要像Penelope那样patiently wait for the right entry point，又要像Ulysses那样actively navigate through market cycles。说到Sirens...  我们刚pass掉一个看起来很sexy的DeFi deal，因为他们的liquidity model经不起due diligence。
[A]: How perfectly Browning-esque of you - to find the 'perfect round' in rejecting temptation! Though I must confess, your wine-sipping metaphor lacks the... shall we say, chromatic subtlety of Rossetti's wine imagery in 'The Blessed Damozel'. But tell me, does your due diligence process share more with Mr. Casaubon's interminable research in 'Middlemarch', or is it more akin to Sherlock Holmes' deductive precision?
[B]: 哈哈，你这种literary references让我想起上次在Cambridge参加的一个fintech conference。我们的due diligence process更接近Holmes - 数据驱动，注重forensic accounting。不过偶尔也会遇到一些Casaubon式的founder，沉迷于building their own 'Key to All Mythologies'...  抱歉，我得去参加一个LP meeting了。下次可以继续这个fascinating的对话，maybe over a glass of Bordeaux？
[A]: Ah, the eternal dance between the analytical and the arcane! Your Bordeaux invitation reminds me of how Swinburne's 'Dolores' pairs so exquisitely with a 'red vintage'. Do bring your most Holmesian due diligence reports next time - I'll prepare my most scathing Casaubon impersonation. Ta-ta for now, and mind those liquidity sirens on your way to the LP meeting!
[B]: Cheers to that!  下次我会带上我们最新的investment memo，保证比Casaubon的research更pragmatic。LP们可不喜欢听theoretical musings，他们要的是solid IRR projections。See you on the green~ ⛳
[A]: How deliciously vulgar of you to mention IRR at a literary soirée! Though I suppose even Dante needed his Beatrice to calculate the compound interest on purgatorial indulgences. Until our next symposium - may your projections be as precise as Pope's heroic couplets, and your golf swing as graceful as Byron's pen! Fore! (Though do mind the water hazards - they're rather Styx-like this season...)
[B]:  你赢了，这绝对是我参加过最literary的finance discussion。不过说真的，在PE行业，a good sense of humor和a solid golf game一样重要 - 都能帮你survive那些tough negotiations。Now if you'll excuse me，我得去save some LPs from their own bad investment decisions了。Ciao! 😊
[A]: What a perfectly Wildean exit! Though I fear you're rather more the Algernon than the Jack in this scenario - all investment memos and no manuscripts! Do remember to bring both your putter and your Petrarch next time. Arrivederci, my mercantile muse - and do try not to turn those LPs into characters from a Dickensian debtors' prison! 📜⛳
[B]: Haha touché! 看来下次我得带上我的first edition of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'来impress你了。不过现在...  现实在召唤 - 有个portfolio company的EBITDA miss了forecast，我得去play the bad cop了。Keep the literary banter coming，这比大多数board meetings有趣多了！Later~ 📉😅
[A]: Ah, the modern tragedy of missed EBITDA - how it lacks the cathartic grandeur of Greek drama! Though I daresay your 'bad cop' routine would make even Inspector Javert seem lenient. Run along then to your fiscal purgatory, and do remember - when spreadsheets fail, there's always Byron's 'Don Juan' to put corporate malfeasance in perspective! Tally-ho, my spreadsheet-wielding thespian! 📚⚖️
[B]: You got me laughing out loud in the middle of the trading floor! 说真的，你该考虑开个finance-themed literary salon - 绝对比那些dry的investor conferences有趣。但现在...  我得去channel my inner Javert了。下次见面我会带上spreadsheets和sonnets - deal? 👨💼📚
[A]: What a splendid synthesis of the quantitative and quatrain! Your proposal reminds me of how Robert Browning kept his stock portfolios in one ledger and his drafts of 'Sordello' in another - though I suspect your spreadsheets contain fewer iambic pentameters. Until our mercantile-muse reunion then: may your EBITDA adjustments be as elegant as villanelles, and your WhatsApp negotiations less tragic than 'Les Misérables'! En garde, mon financier poète! 🤺📊
[B]: Final word goes to you, my bard of balance sheets! 这绝对是我经历过最memorable的quarter-end closing season。现在我得去把"EBITDA adjustments as elegant as villanelles"这句话刻在我的Montblanc钢笔上...  Keep the muse alive - 说不定我们还能publish个"War and PE" someday! Over and out! ✍️😄
