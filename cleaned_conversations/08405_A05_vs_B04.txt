[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这让我想起上周在课堂上和学生们讨论过类似的话题。说实话，作为一个语言学家，我更倾向于从认知的角度来看待这个问题。比如我们说“平行宇宙”这个词，在中文里会让人联想到“平行”这个科学概念，但在英文里 “parallel universes” 却常常出现在科幻小说中，带有一些文学上的浪漫色彩。

你有没有注意到，当我们谈论抽象概念时，母语往往会塑造我们的思维方式？有时候我觉得， bilingual people 可能更容易接受这种多维度的想法，因为他们习惯于在不同的语言系统之间切换，就像在不同的宇宙中穿梭一样 😊

不过，你为什么会问起这个呢？是看了什么相关的影视作品，还是单纯对这个概念感兴趣？
[A]: Interesting observation! 你说得对，语言确实会影响思维方式。我记得看过一个研究，说双语者在切换语言时，大脑的激活区域会有不同，有点像在不同的认知轨道上切换，这不就和parallel universes的概念有异曲同工之妙吗？😄

至于我为什么想到这个问题，其实是前两天在读一本关于quantum finance的书，里面提到一个理论，说金融市场其实也可以用多宇宙模型来解释——每一个决策节点都会分裂出不同的“市场宇宙”。虽然听着有点out there，但仔细想想，我们在做投资判断的时候，不也是在预测无数个可能的未来吗？比如一笔M&A，我们得评估各种scenario，每一个都像是一个潜在的平行世界。

说到语言和概念认知，你有没有发现，在金融圈里，很多术语中英文之间的微妙差异也会导致理解偏差？比如“due diligence”，中文可以翻译成“尽职调查”，但这个“尽职”听起来好像更偏向legal obligation，而英文里的due diligence其实包含了一种主动去挖掘、验证的过程。就像我们在看一个deal的时候，不只是走过场，而是真正在探索一个潜在宇宙的真实性 👀
[B]: That’s such a fascinating connection you made between quantum finance and multiverse theory! It reminds me of how in psycholinguistics, we talk about —the idea that certain concepts get compressed into a single term in one language, but require more elaboration in another. “尽职调查” vs. “due diligence” is a perfect example. In Chinese, the emphasis is on fulfilling a duty (尽职), which makes it sound like a checklist item, whereas “due diligence” in English carries this sense of procedural exploration, almost like… well, you said it already—cosmic exploration 🤯

And your point about decision nodes fracturing into financial universes? I can’t help but think of code-switching as a kind of cognitive M&A. When a bilingual speaker shifts from one language to another, they’re not just changing vocabulary—they’re activating different cultural frameworks, emotional registers, even ethical stances. It’s like entering a parallel cognitive market where the same idea might have a different valuation depending on which linguistic currency you're using 💸

I’m actually working on a paper right now about how students in international business programs unconsciously adopt different negotiation styles depending on the language they’re using. It’s eerie how closely it mirrors this branching-path model you described. Makes you wonder—are we all just navigating alternate versions of ourselves through language?

Do you find yourself consciously shifting mental frameworks when you switch languages during deals?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I love this metaphor — code-switching as cognitive M&A. It’s actually something I’ve noticed in cross-border deals, especially when negotiating with teams from different cultural backgrounds. Sometimes even if everyone is speaking English, the underlying “mental framework” is still shaped by their native linguistic roots. For example, a German team might approach a term sheet very analytically, almost like they’re  every clause step by step 📋, while a Chinese counterpart might look at the same document more holistically, trying to sense the overall  of the deal 😌.

And yes — I do catch myself shifting mental frameworks when switching languages during negotiations. When I speak Mandarin, my tone becomes more relational, more about building long-term trust. But when I switch to English, especially in high-stakes meetings with LPs or international co-investors, I lean into a sharper, more direct style. It’s not that I’m being fake; it’s more like activating a different version of myself that fits the linguistic environment. Almost like… tuning into a different frequency on the same radio 📡

Come to think of it, maybe that’s why some deals just feel smoother than others — it’s not only about numbers or strategy, but whether all parties are somehow operating on the same . Have you seen this affect deal outcomes before?
[B]: 完全同意！你提到的这种“调频”现象特别有意思——其实这在语言学里我们叫 。不是简单的词汇替换，而是整个认知框架、社交脚本、甚至是权力关系都在切换。就像你说的，在中文语境下，我们更倾向于用关系性语言（比如 “咱们”、“长远来看”），而在英文里，尤其是金融英语中，语言本身就带有一种契约式、逻辑优先的结构。

我之前在研究国际并购案例时注意到一个很微妙的现象：当谈判陷入僵局，如果其中一方突然开始 code-switching（比如说英文会议中突然冒出一句中文成语），往往意味着他们在试图重新设定沟通的“情感基调”。有时候是为了缓和气氛，比如说一句“大家都是自己人嘛”，有时候则是施压，比如说出“这不是一笔感情投资，是战略决策。” 这种时候，语言转换本身就成了 negotiation tactics 的一部分 📊💡

说到“同频”的重要性，我觉得最成功的 deal 通常发生在双方都愿意做 partial frame accommodation 的时候——不是谁迁就谁的语言，而是共同进入一种“混合认知空间”，可能是用英文谈条款，但保留某些中文概念里的灵活度，比如 “弹性”或者“留有余地”。有点像量子叠加态 😂 既不是纯粹A也不是纯粹B，而是一种新的中间态。

你有没有经历过那种“突然同频”的瞬间？就是谈判桌上所有人好像一下子理解了彼此的潜台词，那一刻语言不再是障碍，反而成了桥梁？
[A]: Oh totally — that  moment is gold in deal-making. I remember one particularly tough cross-border acquisition where we were stuck for weeks on the earn-out structure. The European seller wanted strict performance KPIs tied to EBITDA, while our management team insisted on more qualitative metrics like brand loyalty and customer retention. We went through three rounds of negotiation with almost no progress — it felt like we were speaking completely different languages, even though everyone was using English 🤝➡️💥

Then during a dinner (which you know, in China, dinner always changes the game), one of the German executives mentioned how his family runs a small vineyard in Tuscany. Somehow the conversation shifted to terroir, craftsmanship, and long-term value vs. short-term yield. And boom — lightbulbs everywhere. Suddenly we weren’t just talking about numbers anymore; we were talking about legacy, stewardship, and what it really means to preserve value over time 🍷✨

That’s when the frame shifted. We ended up designing a hybrid model that borrowed from both sides — hard financial milestones plus softer cultural/KPIs like employee engagement and brand sentiment. It was like we’d created a new linguistic-financial dialect just for this deal.

I think food and wine have a way of doing that — they lower the cognitive guardrails a bit, let people operate in a more intuitive, less scripted mode. Kind of like taking the formal M&A playbook and adding some jazz improvisation to it 🎷📊

Do you find that kind of emotional or cultural “anchor” often helps students bridge conceptual gaps in business communication?
[B]: Absolutely — I call it the  in business communication 😄 It’s that grounding in something tangible, human, and sensory that cuts through the abstraction. When students get too stuck in the theory or terminology, I often steer them toward concrete cultural anchors — stories, rituals, even taste memories — because those tap into shared human experience in a way that bullet points never could.

I remember one group of MBA students working on a joint venture between a French luxury brand and a Chinese tech startup. The first few drafts of their proposal were full of jargon like “value alignment” and “synergy,” but nothing really clicked until I asked them:  Suddenly they started talking about fragrance (from the French side), data personalization (from the Chinese side), and how both are ultimately about crafting an intimate, tailored experience. That metaphor became the backbone of their presentation — and it worked! Investors responded to it emotionally before they even saw the numbers 🍵🕶️

It reminds me of what you said about lowering the cognitive guardrails — when we move away from formal language, we access a different part of the brain, one that’s more open to nuance, improvisation, and yes, even magic moments of alignment. In teaching, I’ve found that the best business breakthroughs often come not from better models, but from better metaphors.

You know what’s funny? Even in highly technical fields like quantum finance or computational linguistics, people still fall back on poetic analogies — strings, waves, black boxes, terroir. Maybe the mind just needs a little narrative sugar to swallow the analytical pill 💊✨

So… do you have a go-to metaphor when things get too dry or technical in a deal room? Or maybe a favorite analogy you pull out when you want to reset the tone?
[A]: Oh, I love the  — I might just steal that for my next pitch deck 😄

You’re absolutely right about metaphors being the narrative sugar for complex ideas. In fact, I use them all the time — especially when we hit that wall of jargon and everyone’s eyes start glazing over. My go-to? Comparing deals to… golf courses 🏌️‍♂️

Yep, I tell the team: “Think of this deal like a 18-hole course. Some holes are straightforward par 3s — clean, quick, not much wind. Others are brutal par 5s with water hazards, doglegs, and sand traps hiding everywhere.” It sounds silly at first, but it actually helps people visualize risk, timeline, and complexity in a more intuitive way.

And when things get really dry — like during a 3-hour cap table deep dive — I switch to wine analogies. I’ll say something like, “This equity structure is a bit like a young Bordeaux — potential’s there, but it needs aging, some blending, and definitely the right storage conditions.” Suddenly people perk up, start asking questions like “Is it tannic?” or “What vintage are we talking about?” and before you know it, we’ve turned a spreadsheet nightmare into a sensory discussion 🍷📊

But the one analogy that never fails — especially when trying to reset tone — is comparing co-investors to jazz band members. I’ll say, “Look, we can all be amazing soloists on our own, but if we want this deal to swing, someone’s gotta play rhythm, someone takes lead, and yes, even the drummer has to know when to lay back.” That usually softens the room, brings down the ego temp a few degrees, and opens the door for real collaboration 🎷💼

So yeah, I’m with you — better metaphors > better models. What’s your favorite business-meets-poetry combo these days?
[B]: Haha, I’m living for these analogies — especially the jazz band one. It’s so true; deal-making  like improvisation. You can have a chart, but if no one’s listening to the rhythm section, you’re just noise 🎷🚫➡️🎶

I’ve been experimenting with a new one lately — actually inspired by my calligraphy hobby. I compare cross-cultural communication to brushwork in Chinese characters. Each stroke has to be deliberate, but also fluid. Some strokes are hidden — like the “heart” component in 想 (xiǎng, "to think") — you don’t see it at first glance, but it carries the emotional weight. And sometimes you have to lift the brush before you land the final line, just like in negotiation — silence, space, and timing matter more than force.

So now I tell my students: “Think of your words like brushstrokes. Are you writing clearly? With intention? Or are you smudging the meaning because you’re trying too hard to impress?” 😊

Lately, though, I’ve been obsessed with the metaphor of translation as orchestration. Not just swapping words, but conducting meaning across languages and cultures — adjusting tempo, tone, emphasis. In fact, I’m thinking of structuring my next lecture series around that idea: . Because when you're managing stakeholders from different worlds, you're not just translating language — you're harmonizing worldviews.

Maybe we should co-write a piece someday —  😏🍷
[A]: Haha, I’m already drafting the outline in my head 📝🍷 —  has such a delicious ring to it, don’t you think? It sounds like a secret weapon hidden in plain sight.

I love how you brought in calligraphy — that metaphor runs deep. The idea of hidden strokes carrying emotional weight? That’s exactly what happens in deals. So much of what drives a successful negotiation isn’t visible on the term sheet — it’s the unspoken trust, the past relationships, the cultural instincts that shape how people interpret a pause, a smile, or even silence. And you’re right — trying too hard to impress usually just smudges the meaning. Classic over-engineering 😄

As for your  angle — brilliant. I’ve always thought of good deal communication as a kind of conducting. You don’t just hand each party a solo and hope it works out; you adjust their tone, timing, and emphasis so that the final performance feels cohesive, even inevitable. Sometimes you mute the brass so the strings can shine; other times, you let the percussion drive the rhythm while everyone else listens.

And honestly, that’s where the real value gets created — not just in the numbers or structure, but in the . That’s why some deals with “better” terms fail, while others with “worse” math succeed. Because one side knew when to hold back, when to emphasize culture over control, when to let the other side feel like they won — even if the economics are balanced.

Alright, I’m officially sold — let’s do it: . I’ll bring the financial metaphors; you bring the brushstrokes and orchestration. Maybe we throw in a few wine pairings at the end of each chapter 🍷📚

You thinking of running this past a publisher or journal? Or should we just drop it on LinkedIn and watch the nerds lose their minds? 😉
[B]: Oh wow, you had me at  and  🍷😄 I think we just birthed a concept here. Honestly, this is exactly the kind of interdisciplinary alchemy that gets overlooked in both academia and finance — the idea that fluency in language  metaphor isn’t just nice-to-have, it’s deal-critical.

I’m imagining a structure already — maybe something like:

1. The Hidden Stroke Principle – how unspoken cultural and emotional cues shape negotiation
2. Code-Switching as Cognitive Capital – bilingual advantage in cross-border strategy
3. Metaphor Arbitrage – where poetic analogy creates real economic value
4. Translation as Orchestration – conducting meaning across systems
5. The Terroir Theory of Trust – why context, not just content, closes deals

And yes, each chapter should definitely end with a suggested wine (or tea) pairing. Chapter 3? Maybe a bold Cabernet Sauvignon — rich in tannins, just like a well-placed metaphor 😄

As for publishing… I say we start on LinkedIn to see which parts catch fire 🔥 The nerds will come out, dissect it, remix it — perfect. Once we get enough traction, we package it into a short-form book or even a special journal issue on cognitive linguistics and finance. Imagine slipping “linguistic arbitrage” into an abstract alongside Chomsky and Soros — poetic justice if you ask me 😉

So when do we start drafting? I’ll take Chapters 1 & 4 — you handle 2 & 3, and we’ll split the wine research budget evenly 😎🍷
[A]: I’m already drafting Chapter 2 in my head on the drive home tonight 😄

 is pure gold — it’s so true that the most powerful parts of a deal are often invisible. Like that tiny hook in 想 that represents “heart” — subtle, hidden, but essential. In PE, we see this all the time: the real reason a founder sells isn’t in the data room, it’s in a quiet conversation over dinner about wanting to spend more time with family, or fear of disruption, or even guilt. Those emotional brushstrokes? They’re the ones that actually move the needle.

And  as a chapter title? Chef’s kiss 🍷 I think that one’s going to be my favorite to write — not just because of the Cabernet pairing (though I’m definitely onboard), but because I’ve seen how a single well-placed analogy can turn gridlock into momentum. It’s not just storytelling; it’s story engineering.

Let’s lock this in:

- You: Chapters 1 & 4 – language structure, calligraphy, orchestration  
- Me: Chapters 2 & 3 – code-switching frameworks, metaphor economics  
- Shared duty: Wine pairings, tone calibration, and strategic arrogance 😎

We should also build a little companion piece — maybe a short LinkedIn series called  to prime the audience. One post per concept, bite-sized and punchy. See what sticks before we go full manuscript mode.

And hey, if this catches fire, we do a live talk. You bring the linguistic theory, I bring the financial jargon, and together we confuse  people into buying the book 😉  

Sound good? Ready when you are.
[B]: Oh, I love how this is shaping up — you’re speaking my language now 😄 And not just any language…  language. The one we just invented together.

Let’s ride this wave while it’s got momentum. I’ll start drafting Chapter 1 this weekend — I’ve already got a few killer examples from my students’ case studies. One team was negotiating with a Spanish firm and completely missed the cultural weight behind  vs. . It’s not just translation; it’s stroke order in action. You can’t rush it, or you end up with a character that looks right but doesn’t carry meaning.

And yes to  — brilliant idea. I’ll ghostwrite the first post for LinkedIn if you give me your top three metaphors from Chapter 3. We drop it on a Monday morning, when everyone’s still caffeinated enough to care 📈

I’m even thinking of inviting some of my former students who work in cross-border M&A to beta-read. They’ll give us brutally honest feedback — which I need before we go full academic rebel on Chomsky & Soros 😂

So here’s my vote:  
- Launch “Words That Deal” next Monday  
- Share draft intros by Friday EOD  
- Celebrate with an actual bottle of Cabernet once we finish the outline 🍷

And don’t worry — I’ll handle the strategic arrogance part. I’ve had years of academic practice at sounding slightly annoyingly confident while citing obscure theory 😌

Let’s make this thing real.
[A]: I couldn't have scripted this better myself —  language, built on the fly, blending finance with linguistics and just the right amount of arrogance 🍷😎. I’m telling you, we’re not just writing something smart — we’re building a whole new dialect of deal-making thought.

Count me in on the timeline:

- Monday: Launch  — drop the first post like a conceptual grenade  
- Friday EOD: Share intros, get brutally honest feedback rolling  
- Cabernet Milestone: Celebrate once the outline sings — which I have no doubt it will  

I’ll send over my top three metaphors for Chapter 3 tonight — one involves tango dancing, another is oddly inspired by sushi rice (long story), and the third? Yeah, that’s the Cabernet moment.

Let’s make  the thing nobody knew they needed until now.

You’ve got my back on the academic swagger — I’ll handle the financial jargon fog, you bring the elegant theory slicing. Together, we’re unstoppable 😄

See you on LinkedIn Monday — and may the arbitrage be ever in our favor.
[B]: Oh, we are absolutely unstoppable — like a perfectly timed  of theory and practice 😂 Tango, sushi rice, and Cabernet? I need to start taking notes.

I’ll be ready Monday with the first post — let’s give it that punchy opener:  
“What if the best deals aren’t made in boardrooms… but in the spaces between languages?”  
Then drop the 🍷😎 emoji and let the algorithm do its thing.

See you on the feed, in the drafts, and very soon — at the bookstore. Cheers to that.
[A]: Beautiful. That opener? 🔥

"What if the best deals aren’t made in boardrooms… but in the spaces between languages?"  
Add a splash of 🍷😎 and let the cognitive arbitrage begin.

I’ll be right there with you — sharpening my pen, polishing my metaphors, and quietly aging a fine Cabernet for launch day. Let’s make linguists second-guess finance, and make financiers finally care about stroke order 😌📈

See you Monday — ready to disrupt the discourse, one bilingual deal at a time.
[B]: You’re speaking my dialect again — I love it 😄

Let’s just say… come Monday, we won’t just be entering the discourse.

We’ll be rewriting it.
[A]: Now  — is a dangerous and beautiful thing to say 😈

Let’s make Monday matter.
[B]: Oh, it’s already mattered — the second we hit “send” on that outline draft 😉  
But yeah… let’s make it . Monday’s not just another day.

It’s deal day.
