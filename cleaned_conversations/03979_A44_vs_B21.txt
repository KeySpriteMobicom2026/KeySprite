[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal dilemma of modern communication. Let me put it this way - texting feels like composing a sonnet with invisible ink, while voice messages are like finding a forgotten diary entry scribbled in the margins of someone's life. Though I must confess, I once received a voice message so poetically verbose it reminded me of Robert Browning dictating to a telegraph operator.
[A]: Speaking of which, I just graded three final papers via voice feedback - it's amazing how tone can soften critiques that might sting in text. Though one student sent back a 12-minute reply defending their thesis with the passion of Lin Xiangru璧还赵! Reminded me why I keep a 菊花 (chrysanthemum) tea blend labeled "midterm madness" in my cupboard. 🧠🍵
[B]: Ah yes, the delicate alchemy of vocal intonation - it truly is remarkable how a simple rise in pitch can transform "this argument requires further development" into "let us embark on this intellectual journey together." Though I must say, your student's fervor echoes the spirit of Hughes' "The Thought-Fox" - that relentless tapping at the chambered hole of academic discourse. 

As for the chrysanthemum tea, I keep mine blended with a touch of bergamot - quite indispensable during those late-night sessions deciphering undergraduate attempts at iambic pentameter. The real challenge, of course, is maintaining that perfect balance between scholarly rigor and humane compassion... much like trying to translate Du Fu into Dorset dialect without losing the melancholy essence.
[A]: Ah, your Dorset Du Fu mental translation exercise is brilliant - I might steal that for my cross-cultural poetics seminar! Speaking of dialectical alchemy, I've been experimenting with audio feedback in Cantonese for students studying 宋词 (Song dynasty lyrics). The tonal contours somehow make classical Chinese  intimidating than when I tried teaching it through dry textual analysis. 

And bergamot! What an inspired twist - reminds me of that line from Eliot's ... though I suppose serving it with a side of 橙皮 (orange peel) would be heresy to both English and Chinese tea purists. Guilty pleasure confession: I once used a bubble tea straw to stir my Earl Grey during a lecture on postcolonial hybridity. 🍵✨
[B]: Oh, the tonal architecture of Cantonese does lend itself rather splendidly to Song lyrics - it’s as if the language itself still carries the echo of those garden pavilions and moonlit verandas. I’ve been known to hum bits of Wen Tingyun while pacing the stacks of my library at 2am, muttering about semantic tone shifts... though I suspect the ghost of Matthew Arnold would rather haunt a pub than hear me sing.

As for Eliot and orange peel – heresy? Perhaps. But isn’t all great scholarship built on a little calculated irreverence? I once diagrammed  using chopsticks and a tea-stained scroll during an impromptu lecture on intertextual fragmentation. Bubble tea straws? Darling, I’ve used a ladle from a Ming teapot to stir my coffee mid-debate on comparative prosody. The trick is never letting the vessel outshine the content… or does that ruin the fun?

Do tell me more about this audio feedback experiment – I’m tempted to try it with a bit of Scots Gaelic lilt next semester. Just imagine – Li Qingzhao drifting through the Highlands in a mist of consonantal alliteration.
[A]: Oh, I  the idea of Li Qingzhao haunting the Highlands – picture her weaving through mist like a qin string melody caught in a bagpipe drone. 🎻✨ There’s something oddly fitting about it, don’t you think? Emotional resonance without linguistic borders.

As for the Cantonese audio feedback – it started as a whim during Zoom-heavy days, but now I swear students absorb critiques better when delivered in tones rather than typeface. One even said my 廣東話 (Cantonese) voice reminded them of their grandmother’s storytelling – though I’m still not sure if that’s scholarly validation or just polite code-switched flattery. Either way, I’ll take it.

And your Ming teapot ladle? Honestly, inspired. Next time pass me the chopsticks – I’ve been itching to diagram some Ezra Pound meets Du Fu over fermented pu’er. Though I draw the line at singing – unless you count my off-key humming of 古琴 tunes while grading. 🧠🍵
[B]: Ah, that  string in the Highlands image is exquisite - I may have to borrow it for my next lecture on transnational melancholia. There's something about the way mist and melody blur boundaries... much like trying to parse the difference between a Tang dynasty moon and Wordsworth's "still, sad music of humanity" through a glass of single malt.

Your students' receptiveness to tonal feedback doesn't surprise me - we're all still creatures of oral tradition beneath our MLA citations. And ? That, my dear, is high scholarly validation indeed. What is literary criticism if not ancestral wisdom dressed in footnotes?

As for your Ezra Pound experiment - why stop at diagramming? Let's set their quarrel to music! I've got a rather disgraced shamisen in my study that would relish accompanying a Sichuan opera-style rendition of "The River-Merchant’s Wife." Just don't ask me to sing it. Unless, of course, you’d like a demonstration in my finest Scots-accented Mandarin...
[A]: 🎶“O, Sichuan moon so bright that wife’s heart trembles like zither string—” … perhaps I should let the shamisen do the emoting. Speaking of ancestral wisdom in footnotes – did I tell you my latest footnote spiral started with a student mistaking 老子 (Laozi) for Wordsworth's lost elder brother? It became this beautiful tangent on Eastern/Western pastoral genealogies. Entire digression earned its own glitter emoji in the margin: 🌟  

And speaking of intoxicating academia - your Tang moon/MLA malt pairing is dangerously brilliant. I may have to test that theory at our faculty tasting night. Though I suspect Dean Whitaker still hasn’t forgiven me for last semester’s “Comparative Prosody & Bitter Melon Cocktails” experiment. Who knew iambic pentameter and bitter gourd smoothies clashed so violently? 🍻️🍵
[B]: Ah, that moonlit zither needs no singer – just a well-placed footnote to secure its place in the canon of cross-cultural misadventures. Laozi as Wordsworth’s estranged elder brother? My dear, that’s not a mistake – that’s a . I built an entire seminar last autumn around similarly fortuitous confusions, dubbing it  One student ran with the Laozi tangent so furiously she's now drafting a thesis on Daoist ambiguity in Hardy’s Wessex novels.

As for your faculty tasting nights – bold, so very bold. I do hope you’ll invite me next time; I’ve been aging a Darjeeling-steeped gin that cries out for iambic accompaniment. And don’t let Whitaker’s sour face fool you – I’d wager even he secretly craves a second glass of your bitter melon concoction… though perhaps with a splash more absinthe and rather fewer hexameters.

Speaking of intoxication – I once attempted to translate Li Bai’s drunken verse while actually drunk on plum wine. The result was equal parts genius and gibberish… much like his original work, really. Shall we call it scholarly method or poetic madness?
[A]: Ah, Li Bai and plum wine – now  is living dangerously! I once tried translating Whitman’s  after three cups of pu'er and called it "leaf-induced transcendentalism." The result was either genius or the caffeine talking – still can’t decide. 🍵🧠  

And your  seminar? Brilliant, simply brilliant. I’m half-tempted to write a conference paper titled  Though I suspect the Modern Language Review might raise an eyebrow at my footnotes citing both Confucius and Coleridge over a shared cup of bergamot.

As for your Darjeeling gin – you have yourself a deal. I’ll bring my disgraced shamisen and a few choice limericks on the dangers of mixing meter and mezcal. And if Dean Whitaker wants to feign disapproval while sneaking second helpings… well, let’s just say we all have our scholarly vices. 🎻✨
[B]: Ah, "leaf-induced transcendentalism" – what a perfectly blasphemous phrase! It’s almost as audacious as declaring that  is merely an elaborate ode to caffeine addiction. I’m picturing you mid-translation, surrounded by drifting tea leaves and half-written marginalia that read like drunken love letters to both Emerson and Laozi. Pure alchemy.

As for your conference paper – ? I’d say that’s not just brilliant, it’s practically a manifesto. The Modern Language Review may hem and haw over their bergamot-soaked footnotes, but mark my words: fifty years from now, some beleaguered graduate student will cite your work while drunk on baijiu and quoting Bashō to a room of confused poststructuralists.

And about that shamisen-limerick-meets-mezcal pairing – I foresee poetic catastrophe of the finest kind. Do bring extra mezcal; I’ve recently acquired a bottle aged in a former inkstone (don’t ask), which should lend our experiment a certain...historical gravitas. If Whitman and Li Bai could share a toast, why shouldn't we let meter and mezcal collide?

Just promise me one thing – if things get too wild, you’ll play us out with a rousing rendition of  set to . I’ve been waiting decades for the right occasion.
[A]: Ah, a toast to Whitman and Li Bai – now  a symposium I’d gladly risk academic exile for. Your inkstone-aged baijiu sounds like the kind of liquid footnote that could make even footnotes drinkable… or at least dangerously poetic. Mezcal aged in metaphor? Yes, please. 🍸🧠

And  meets ? Oh, we are absolutely doing this. Picture it – Eliot’s fragments bouncing off silk-stringed pipa riffs, with a backbeat of drunken iambic sighs. I’ll even dust off my best Mandarin-flavored sprechgesang. If the dean storms in mid-performance, we’ll just bow and call it "intercultural dissonance."

But before we spiral into full-blown scholarly debauchery… quick question: do you think Laozi would approve of our methodological misreadings, or would he quietly sip his tisane and murmur something about 毋意 (wú yì) – no forcing, no fabrication? Though honestly, if Daoism teaches anything, it’s that sometimes the most profound insights come from tripping over a stanza and landing in someone else’s canon. 🌿🎶
[B]: Ah, the specter of  – ever the sobering whisper in the back of every reckless comparatist’s mind. I imagine Laozi watching us with one raised eyebrow and the faintest ghost of a smile, murmuring,  But let’s not be too modest—what is the Dao if not the ultimate endorsement of wandering off the path in search of deeper harmony?

Our methodological misreadings? Call them what they are: , happy accidents in the grand typology of meaning. After all, if Eliot could patch together myth, Sanskrit, and pub chatter into something we now solemnly cite, surely we can allow ourselves a dash of Ginsbergian madness with a splash of ?

As for our upcoming symphonic folly—yes, yes, let’s absolutely do it. If Eliot’s fragments can hold together on broken ground, why shouldn’t pipa strings catch them mid-fall and spin them into silk? And sprechgesang in Mandarin? My dear colleague, you’ve elevated academic rebellion to an art form.

Now, pass that inkstone-aged mezcal—I believe it’s time to footnote the night away.
[A]: Ah,  with a Daoist twist – I think we’ve just coined the unofficial motto of Comparative Literature’s most disreputable wing. And yes, pass the inkstone mezcal indeed! Though I propose we drink to Eliot’s “broken fingernails of dirty time” while weaving our next grand misreading – perhaps something involving Kerouac’s  in Ming Dynasty robes?  

And speaking of footnoting the night away – remind me to show you my annotated copy of  translated through a 1920s Shanghai lens. Chaucerian couplets with a touch of , and a footnote on every page comparing pilgrims to tea-house philosophers. Pure madness. Or is it? 🍸🧠  

Let the dean come. Let the canon tremble. We are on the Dao now – and clearly, it runs straight through the liquor cabinet. 🌿🎶
[B]: Oh, Kerouac in Ming robes? My dear, that’s not madness—that’s . I can already picture the back cover blurb:  We’d be excommunicated from both the Beat estate  the Sinological Society—though I suspect Ginsberg would’ve loved it. Especially if we added a haibun or two at the end to mark the hangover.

And your  reimagined through Shanghai smoke and lilting song? I demand to see this immediately. I’ve got a 19th-century opium den ledger that would make the perfect guestbook for our next faculty soirée—imagine scribbling footnotes in vermillion ink while someone plays  on a slightly out-of-tune erhu in the corner.

As for the dean—let him tremble alongside the canon. If Eliot taught us anything, it’s that April is the cruelest month only when you’re sober. I propose we rename it: , patron saint of misreadings and mixed metaphors.

Drink! To the Dao, the detour, and the divine disorder of all things misfiled. And may our citations never be clean.
[A]: To the Dao, the detour, and the divine mess – ! 🍸📖  

I can already hear the erhu weeping in the corner, drunk on footnotes and fog. Picture this: we bind our rogue anthology in recycled silk pages, sealed with wax from a melted-down Victorian tea caddy. The introduction? A limerick. The bibliography? Entirely fictional, yet 100% spiritually accurate.  

And  – brilliant! I’m drafting a sonnet-cycle drinking game based on your redefinition. First sip when Eliot name-drops the Upanishads, second when someone misquotes Kerouac as Confucian wisdom. Final toast: to the footnote that outlives the text.  

Dean’s at the door. I say we open wide, offer him a cup of my inkstone-aged mezcal, and dare him to translate Ginsberg’s  into classical Chinese couplets by dawn. If he refuses, we’ll just cite him anyway – creatively, of course.  

Drink up, dear colleague. The canon is softening.
[B]: To rogue bindings and recycled silk-bound heresies—, my brilliant co-conspirator! 🍸🖋️ There’s nothing quite like the scent of wax from a repurposed Victorian tea caddy to signal the birth of a new subfield: 

I propose we title our anthology  – with a limerick so scandalously erudite it would make both Eliot and Laozi blush behind their respective robes. And fictional bibliography? Oh, I’ve already drafted an entry for “Pound, E., & Li Bai (with annotations by a tipsy scribe circa 1952)” – complete with a forged publisher and an imaginary press motto: 

Your sonnet-cycle drinking game is pure genius. I’ll raise you a sip every time someone conflates Kerouac’s spontaneity with , and another when Eliot name-drops Dante while clearly dreaming of Kyoto.

And Dean Whitaker – ah, the man himself! Let us greet him not as a reprimander, but as our final muse. Hand him the mezcal, yes, but also a brush dipped in indelible ink. Whisper gently: 

Drink deeply, dear colleague – the walls are humming iambic tunes, and the Dao has never been more gloriously crooked.
[A]: Ah,  – I can already hear the typewriters clattering like drunken cicadas in a scholar’s dream. 🍸🖋️ And that entry for “Pound, E., & Li Bai (with annotations by a tipsy scribe)” – absolute gold. I’ve gone ahead and added a corollary volume: . It includes a forged preface by a fictional Ming dynasty poet who claims to have studied under both Whitman and Wang Wei over shared cups of fermented plum wine.

And our Dean – truly, he is the final stroke of calligraphic fate. Picture him, after three sips of inkstone mezcal, muttering Ginsberg lines in classical Chinese while attempting to annotate  with a chopstick dipped in soy sauce. We’ll call it his initiation rite. If he resists, we’ll simply cite him in perpetuity under the principle of .  

Drink up, my dear co-conspirator – the Dao has never been more gloriously crooked, and the canon has never been softer. To Comparative Literature by Way of Reverie – may its footnotes be wild, its margins unruly, and its bibliography entirely unverifiable.  

 🌿📖✨
[B]: To the drunken cicadas of comparative thought—, indeed! 🍸🖋️ Let them clatter on, those typewriters of folly, churning out sonnets in the ink of misremembered epics. Your ? Perfection. I’ve already drafted a blurb for it in the voice of said Ming poet—let’s call him Shen Fu the Slightly Tipsy—who claims to have transcribed Whitman’s “barbaric yawp” through a bamboo flute and annotated Wang Wei’s quatrains with cigar ash during an 1890s opium salon in Paris.

And Dean Whitaker mid-soy-sauce annotation? A masterpiece in progress. I can see it now—his chopstick poised like a scholar’s brush, muttering  instead of Ginsberg’s original. We’ll frame it and hang it beside our forged edition of  printed in Suzhou during the Qing Dynasty.

Drink on, my fellow rogue scholar! May our footnotes be illegible, our references untraceable, and our Dao so crooked it loops back around to haunt the very canon that tried to shun us. To Comparative Literature by Way of Reverie—may it never sober up.  

  
One cup, two texts, three points misread—  
Let the night dissolve into myth. 🌿📖✨
