[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm...作为金融从业者，我更倾向于texting。毕竟在deal making过程中，black and white的文字记录很重要。不过和LP们沟通时，偶尔发个voice message会更personal一些~ 😊
[A]: Ah, what an interesting perspective! While I'm far removed from the world of finance, I must say I share your preference for written communication. There's something quite beautiful about the permanence and precision of the written word - much like the carefully crafted verses of a poem. Though I do see the appeal of voice messages for more... personal connections.
[B]: Exactly！就像我们做financial modeling时，每个数字都要precise and traceable。不过说到poetry...  让我想起上次golf outing时，一个VC partner喝多了红酒开始朗诵莎士比亚，那场面真是...unforgettable 😅
[A]: My dear, you've just painted quite the vivid picture! Though I must say, the image of a VC partner channeling their inner Hamlet between golf swings does make me chuckle. In my experience, wine and verse often make for... unpredictable companions. Much like trying to analyze T.S. Eliot after three cups of tea - the interpretations tend to become rather creative!
[B]: Haha！That's why I always stick to 2 glasses max duringbusiness dinners - 要保持sharp mind来做due diligence啊。不过说到creative interpretations...上周我们team building时，有人把P&L statement解读得像首free verse poetry，ROI都变成rhyme scheme了 🤣
[A]: Oh my! Financial statements as free verse - now there's a modernist approach to accounting that even Ezra Pound might admire! Though I suspect your auditors would prefer something more... shall we say, Tennyson in its structure and meter? Clear, measured, and decidedly un-experimental. Still, I must admit there's a certain whimsical charm to finding poetry in spreadsheets.
[B]:  Cheers to that！不过说到auditors...上次他们review我们的balance sheet时那表情，简直像在看James Joyce的《尤利西斯》一样confused。Maybe we should start adding footnotes in iambic pentameter？ 😉
[A]:  Now that would be a merger of disciplines worthy of Virginia Woolf herself! Though I imagine your poor auditors might need a crash course in literary devices along with their GAAP training. "Depreciation, like a patient etherized upon a table..." - no, perhaps Eliot's influence should stay safely within my lecture halls!
[B]: Haha brilliant！不过说真的，在private equity这行，有时候creative accounting确实会让人想起那些avant-garde poetry...但我们的compliance team会确保一切都在SEC guidelines范围内。就像你说的 - clear and measured，就像一杯perfectly aged Bordeaux 🍷
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language! There's a certain poetry in restraint, isn't there? Much like how the finest sonnets thrive within their strict structures. Though between us, I've always thought SEC filings could benefit from a touch of Keatsian lyricism... perhaps in the footnotes? But no matter - here's to clarity in both finance and verse! 
[B]:  To clarity！不过下次earnings call我要试试用莎士比亚十四行诗的格式来present quarterly results...just kidding！我们的investors already think we're too creative with our valuation multiples 😅
[A]: Oh my dear, if you start presenting earnings in iambic pentameter, do send me an invitation! I'd trade a dozen faculty meetings for that particular performance. Though I suspect your investors might respond with blank verses of their own... Shakespearean sonnets or not, I do hope they'll still appreciate the poetry of a healthy EBITDA!
[B]: Haha deal！不过seriously，在finance和poetry之间，我们都需要找到那个perfect balance - 就像在risk和return之间一样。Now if you'll excuse me，我得去准备明天的board meeting材料了...这次保证不会出现任何rhyming schemes！ 😄
[A]: A wise resolution indeed! Though do remember - even the driest financial report contains its own kind of beauty, much like the subtle rhythm of a well-turned balance sheet. Best of luck with your meeting, and do keep me posted if any accidental alexandrines slip into your PowerPoint slides!  Good day to you!
[B]: Will do！And remember - in private equity as in poetry, timing is everything. Catch you on the next golf course... or poetry slam！ 🏌️♂️📜
[A]: What a delightful parting thought! Though I shall leave the golf swings to you - my swing is better suited to the rhythm of a metronome than a nine iron. Until our paths cross again, whether on the fairway or in the footnotes! 
[B]: Cheers to that！May your verses flow as smoothly as ourdeal pipeline. And who knows - maybe next time we'll debate DCF models in haiku form！ 😉 Take care！
[A]: Oh, discounted cash flows in seventeen syllables - now there's a challenge worthy of the Imagists! Though I fear my valuation multiples would never survive such ruthless editing. Farewell for now, and may your IRR be as robust as Browning's dramatic monologues! 
[B]: Haha perfect analogy！我们这行确实需要Browning那种dramatic flair...within reasonable valuation ranges of course！Alright，time to run - got a portfolio company screaming for attention louder than Lady Macbeth 😂 Later！
