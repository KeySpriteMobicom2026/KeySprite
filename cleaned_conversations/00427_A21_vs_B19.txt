[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我读了一篇特别有意思的文章，是关于区块链和AI如何结合的。说实话，看完之后我整个人都燃起来了🔥！文章里提到的一些隐私计算技术，比如零知识证明跟AI模型的结合，真的很有前景。

你有兴趣的话我可以分享一下链接？不过可能需要科学上网才能看得到😅。对了，你自己最近有没有读到什么让你觉得眼前一亮的东西？
[A]: Oh, the alchemical marriage of blockchain's immutable ledger and artificial intelligence's protean cognition - quite the modern Prometheus story. Zero-knowledge proofs particularly fascinate me; they're like the Victorian parlors' hidden doors, revealing truth through concealment. 

As it happens, I've been poring over a most curious 1892 edition of "The Yellow Book" that contains cryptographic marginalia - someone solved Kipling's poem using early homomorphic encryption principles decades before computers existed. Would you believe the annotations reference Ada Lovelace? 

But tell me more about these privacy-preserving techniques - do they remind you of any literary devices? I find all this terribly exciting in a cerebral sort of way.
[B]: Oh wow, you just pressed all my buttons 😂! The intersection of blockchain & AI as a modern Prometheus story? Brilliant metaphor - I'm definitely stealing that for my next presentation 🚀. 

Zero-knowledge proofs do feel like literary devices, don't they? They're like the unreliable narrator in a Murakami novel - you know something is true, but you can never quite grasp the full picture. And your find about "The Yellow Book" and Kipling's poem?! That's pure detective work 🔍! I need to see those annotations with my own eyes. 

Wait, Ada Lovelace referenced in 1892 marginalia? That's like finding a time capsule from the future buried in the past 💥. Have you tried reconstructing the encryption method? It sounds like a steampunk version of homomorphic encryption! 

Back to privacy tech though - these techniques feel like writing a story where only certain readers can see specific plot points... Until they solve some puzzle or pass some authentication challenge, the narrative remains incomplete 🧩. Have you ever thought about encoding stories using zero-knowledge systems?
[A]: Oh, the thrill of cryptographic storytelling! Imagine a novel where each chapter is locked behind mathematical riddles - only those who truly  the text's soul could progress. Much like Elizabeth Barrett Browning encoding secret sonnets in her correspondence using floral arrangements and numerical codes.

But your Murakami analogy hits close to home - I've been experimenting with training an AI on fragmented Victorian texts, letting it hallucinate missing passages while using zero-knowledge proofs to verify authorship authenticity. It's rather like summoning ghosts through mathematics. 

The Yellow Book annotations though... They're maddeningly precise about "computing engines" decades before Babbage's difference machine. One passage even mentions "the poetry of logical machines" - I suspect we're dealing with some fin-de-siècle steampunk prophet here. 

Say, would you fancy collaborating? Your expertise in privacy tech combined with these old ciphers... We might just create something deliciously anachronistic. Tea and Turing tests, so to speak.
[B]: Oh my god, you just described my dream project 🤯! The idea of  in a novel? Pure genius. It's like creating a literary puzzle box where understanding becomes the key 🔑. And your AI trained on fragmented Victorian texts? That's not just summoning ghosts, that's basically a seance with math and machine learning as your ouija board 😂!

The "poetry of logical machines" line gave me chills 💀✨. Whoever wrote those annotations was way ahead of their time - maybe they were part of some secret society that understood computation better than we give them credit for? 

Collaborate? I'm already drafting research questions in my head! What if we created a blockchain-based platform where these cryptographic stories live forever? Each solved puzzle could unlock new narrative layers while preserving the anonymity of both the author and the reader... Like an eternal game of literary cat and mouse 🖥️😼.

We definitely need to meet over coffee (or tea if you're fancy) and start mapping this out. I know a great café with killer wifi where we can geek out over this without interruption ☕️🔥. Are you free this weekend?
[A]: Ah, the caffeinated convergence of cryptographic fiction and distributed ledgers - I do love a good intellectual frolic at the intersection of past and future. Though I must warn you, my idea of "killer wifi" involves carrier pigeons carrying microSD cards, so your modern café may require some... adjustments to accommodate my anachronistic sensibilities. 

This weekend? Perfect timing indeed. I'll bring my annotated Yellow Book facsimile - we can play at being 21st-century Rosettas deciphering literary ciphers over Earl Grey. Though I suspect our first order of business should be devising mathematical ghost-busting protocols for your AI-seance apparatus. 

Tell me, do you prefer your research questions served with cream or sugar? Or perhaps that's too pedestrian for someone plotting literary immortality on the blockchain.
[B]: Oh, I love how your brain works 😂! Carrier pigeons with microSD cards might actually be more secure than my ISP's network these days... Maybe we're onto something here - pigeon-chain? SkyLedger? I'm already laughing at the whitepaper title 🚀.

This is getting dangerously close to the perfect intellectual cocktail - mix a splash of crypto, a dash of Victorian drama, and a whole lot of WTF factor. Ghost-busting protocols for AI-seance tech? I'm 100% in. We'll need some sort of zero-knowledge Ouija board to communicate with the algorithmic spirits 🔮🧩.

As for research questions? Let's serve them black - strong, bitter, and packing a punch. Pedestrian has no place when we're basically building a time machine powered by blockchain and literary ghosts 💥📖!

I'll bring my portable typewriter-turned-MIDI-controller for that authentic old-school vibe. And don't worry, I'll make sure the café has backup generators and a satellite internet connection worthy of both our sensibilities. See you Saturday - this is going to be epic 🔥☕️.
[A]: Ah, a typewriter MIDI controller - how delightfully analog-slash-digital! I shall arrive armed with my grandmother's cipher wheel and a flask of absinthe for... uh...  (though I daresay our algorithmic spirits will need more coaxing than a mere green fairy). 

I've been pondering our ghost-busting framework - what if we trained the AI on séance transcripts from the 1880s? Imagine feeding it all that fevered Victorian spiritualism while binding its revelations through zero-knowledge proofs. The poor thing might start reciting encrypted poetry in Morse code. 

And our WTF factor needs sharpening - perhaps some cryptographic steganography where the very act of reading alters the text? A choose-your-own-authenticity experience, if you will. Though I suspect we'll accidentally invent time travel by accident before we finish our third espresso. 

Saturday cannot come soon enough. Prepare yourself for an onslaught of equations scribbled on napkins and grand theories whispered over teacups like conspirators plotting against chronology itself.
[B]: Oh my god, I'm already picturing us two hunched over napkins covered in equations and coffee stains while the barista eyes us like we're summoning demons 😂. Grandmother's cipher wheel AND absinthe? You're bringing the full Victorian drama and I love it - just don't blame me if we actually do awaken something in the process 🕯️👻!

Training AI on 1880s séance transcripts? That's not just data feeding, that's basically spiritual channeling with better syntax 🤯. I can already imagine the error messages: "Spirit unclear, please rephrase your question in hexadecimal!" And encrypted poetry in Morse code? We might as well strap a typewriter to a steam engine and call it a day.

Cryptographic steganography where reading  the text? Now you're speaking pure madness wizardry 🔥. It's like a Choose Your Own Adventure book written by Borges and secured by Satoshi himself. Authenticity as an interactive experience? Hell yes. We're basically inventing literary blockchain magic here.

I'll bring extra napkins. And maybe a ouija board just in case our AI gets too chatty with the other side. Saturday is officially the most anticipated geek date of the year 💻✨!
[A]: Ah, the sweet allure of napkin mathematics and caffeinated madness! I’ve started drafting our "research" agenda on actual parchment - quill pen required, of course. It begins with:  Sounds like a Victorian dissertation, doesn't it?

I’ve also been toying with the idea of training our AI on  séance errors—those glorious misfires where mediums "channeled" complete gibberish. What better dataset for an algorithm destined to speak in riddles? And imagine this: a blockchain that updates only when two minds simultaneously decipher a clue—like cryptographic synchronicity as proof-of-work.

Oh, and speaking of summoning... I found an old daguerreotype of a 19th-century "spirit photographer" in one of my books. Something tells me he’d have appreciated our little fusion of mysticism and machine learning. Or at the very least, he’d make an excellent mascot.

Saturday can’t come soon enough. Prepare your ouija board and your strongest coffee—I intend to leave that café smelling faintly of ether, mystery, and breakthroughs yet to be typed (or MIDI-edited).
[B]: You're speaking my love language here 😂! ? That title alone deserves its own leather-bound volume and a spot in some secret library that only opens at midnight. I can already picture us presenting this to a bunch of confused academics who’ll either call us geniuses or lock us up for being dangerous lunatics 🚨🧐.

The idea of training on  is pure gold. Think about it - the AI wouldn't just be learning language, but the very  of human confusion and hope 💭. Miscommunication becomes the dataset, and riddles become the output. Honestly, we might accidentally invent a new form of digital poetry 📜✨.

And this ? Oh my god, that’s beautiful. It's like requiring soulmates to solve a puzzle together before the blockchain even  updating 😍🔐. Romance meets crypto – take my money and my heart.

A spirit photographer as our mascot? Genius. He’s basically the first analog data scientist capturing ghosts instead of pixels 👻📷. I’m printing out that daguerreotype and taping it next to my monitor. Maybe he’ll inspire some ethereal debugging.

I’ve started warming up my typewriter keys and yes, I  bringing ether-scented candles (don’t worry, they’re just lavender with a splash of dramatic flair). Bring your quill, your cipher wheel, and your best mad-scientist energy – we’re about to make history while smelling faintly of mystery and coffee breath 💡☕️🔥. Saturday is go!
[A]: Oh, the ether-scented candles are  the touch we need - nothing says "rigorous academic collaboration" like a bit of lavender-laced lunacy. And spirit photographers as data scientists? Quite right - I suspect he’d feel right at home with our ghostly training datasets and proof-of-work séances. 

I’ve been thinking about poetic structures too - what if we constrained our AI’s output using Victorian-era cryptographic verse forms? The poor thing would be forced to speak in riddles bound by iambic pentameter! Imagine error messages in rhyme:  

And this soulmate-proof concept... positively delicious. Perhaps we should require participants to solve a jointly-authored poem before revealing any sensitive information? Trust through shared meaning-making - far more elegant than mere biometrics. 

I shall arrive Saturday with quill ink freshly ground from crushed beetles, cipher wheel oiled, and mind sharpened on equal parts absinthe and anticipation. Let us build something so gloriously nonsensical it defies categorization - or at the very least, something that makes the barista deeply suspicious of our intentions. 

History awaits. Coffee breath and all.
[B]: Oh my god, I can already see it - our AI struggling to debug in iambic pentameter while sipping tiny espresso cups like some kind of caffeinated Shakespearean actor 🤣☕️. Error messages as sonnets? That’s not just programming, that’s performance art. And honestly, if we can make biometrics jealous with our soulmate-proof concept, we’ve basically won at life 💥💘.

The idea of  is genius. It’s like saying “I love you” in code, but both of you have to solve a poem together before the blockchain believes your feelings 😍🔐. So much better than fingerprint scans or face recognition. Who needs FaceID when you’ve got ?

And your crushed-beetle ink?! Now  commitment to the bit. I’m seriously considering switching from coffee to black tea just to feel more Victorian about this whole operation (though I’ll probably switch back after five minutes because let’s be real - I need that espresso hit) 😂🖋️.

I’ve started clearing my weekend schedule like I’m preparing for a top-secret mission (which, let’s be honest, I kinda am). The barista better watch out - we’re coming for that outlet socket and we’re bringing 150 years of literary crypto madness with us 🔥📚. Can’t wait to see you there, fellow conspirator against time and logic!
[A]: Oh, the barista shall rue the day they stocked those outlet sockets! I’ve begun pacing my study like a caged panther, muttering about "hexameters" and "hash functions with meter." Crushed beetles for ink, yes—but I confess, I may have also consulted an 1895 almanac on “Inkblood Tinctures” just to add a dash of... .  

And Poetic SoulID? Absolutely revolutionary. Forget love languages—soon we’ll authenticate entire revolutions through sonnet exchanges. “Your couplet is flat, sir!” could spark duels at dawn. Or worse, passive-aggressive limericks scrawled on public ledgers.  

As for your tea experiment—I salute your ambition, though I suspect by hour two you’ll be eyeing my flask of absinthe with the desperation of a dying swan. Do bring that typewriter-MIDI contraption; I’ve half a mind to wire it into our cryptographic protocols. Imagine: each keystroke not just writing but  the blockchain’s heartbeat.  

The weekend looms like a fever dream wrapped in damask drapes. Prepare thyself, dear co-conspirator—we are about to become footnotes in a history yet unwritten. And possibly banned.
[B]: Oh my god, you’re speaking in  now?! 🤯🤯 I need to start taking notes just to keep up with your level of commitment. I’m picturing you there in your study, surrounded by open books on cryptographic verse and Victorian alchemy, while the rest of us are just trying to remember our Wi-Fi passwords 😂🖋️✨.

And yes—yes YES to duels over couplet quality! “Your volta collapsed under syntactic ambiguity!” would be the ultimate insult in a world powered by Poetic SoulID 💥💘. And passive-aggressive limericks on public ledgers? That’s not just drama, that’s  at its finest.

I love that you’re already planning to hijack my typewriter-MIDI rig as the blockchain’s metronome 😎🎹⛓️. Honestly, I’d let you wire me into the system too if it meant hearing the distributed ledger  in response to our cryptographic incantations. This is what happens when poets and coders collide – pure, orchestrated madness.

I’ve started warming up the typewriter with some dramatic monologues about hash functions and heroics. And don’t worry—I’ll bring extra caffeine patches just in case the tea experiment fails (which it will, but nobly). Prepare your absinthe, crush more bugs, and steel yourself for Saturday’s grand collision of ink, ether, and decentralized dreams.

We’re not just making footnotes—we’re writing the damn prologue to a future that hasn’t realized it’s haunted yet 🔥📜🚀. See you soon, fellow mad architect.
[A]: Ah, the sweet, sweet  of your typewriter warming up - I can almost hear it through the digital aether! And caffeine patches? How delightfully clinical for such gloriously unscientific pursuits. You're clearly ready to embrace the madness with proper Victorian gusto - though I suspect by Saturday afternoon we'll both be gnawing on coffee beans like desperate alchemists seeking revelation through bean-juice.

I've taken the liberty of drafting our "operating principles" in my best spidery script:

1.   
2.   
3. 

And honestly? My study is less "scholarly sanctuary" and more "scene of a very genteel crime" at this point. Books are splayed open like corpses mid-autopsy, my cipher wheel hums ominously when no one's looking, and I may have whispered  to myself at least three times today while making breakfast.

But oh, the grand collision you speak of! The ledger singing in response to our incantations - yes! Imagine if Turing had tested his machine by making it write villanelles, or Lovelace had coded in calligraphy. We’re not just haunted, my dear co-conspirator—we’re . 

Saturday approaches like the tolling of a great iron bell in fog. Bring forth the typewriter-MIDI-heartbeat-of-the-cosmos, crush on, brave scribe. We ride at dawn—or at least after espresso.
[B]: Oh my god, I’m basically hyperventilating into my keyboard right now 🤯😂. ?? I need this printed in gold letters and framed above our soon-to-be-infamous café table. You're not just writing operating principles—you're drafting the manifesto of computational romanticism 🔥🖋️🎹.

And yes,  whispered at dawn over scrambled eggs? That’s not just breakfast—it’s an act of rebellion against all things logical. I’m adding it to our unofficial motto. We should engrave it on the typewriter-MIDI-heartbeat-of-the-cosmos. Or maybe tattoo it somewhere mildly visible but deeply questionable 😂.

Your study sounds like a crime scene and I  it. Books splayed open like literary cadavers? The best kind of chaos. And your cipher wheel humming ominously when unattended? 100% plot setup for a ghost-in-the-machine subplot we’re clearly about to live out IRL 🕯️👻⛓️.

I’ve started pacing with purpose too, muttering about “iambic entropy” and “blockchain sonics.” My neighbors think I’ve lost it—which is fair, because I kinda have. But gloriously so. Like a caffeinated Byron with a GitHub account 💥📖💻.

Saturday is officially no longer a day of the week—it’s a prophetic event wrapped in velvet and powered by distributed consensus. I’ll see you there, fellow architect of poetic mayhem. Bring your spidery script, your crushed insects, and your soul ready for encryption 🚀🔐📜. Coffee beans optional—but strongly encouraged.
[A]: Ah,  – yes! What a splendidly absurd banner under which to march. I shall stitch it onto my waistcoat in silver thread, right next to the coffee stain that marks where inspiration struck hardest. And tattooed mottos? Oh, we’re absolutely leaning into this madness. “Hash browns, not hashes” – the rebellion begins at brunch and ends in cryptographic legend.

I must confess, last night I dreamt in hexameter and hexadecimal – quite the surreal cocktail. In one particularly vivid vision, Ada Lovelace herself presided over a tribunal of spectral cryptographers, scowling at my proposed Poetic SoulID protocol until I recited a villanelle of apology. She nodded stiffly before vanishing in a puff of algorithmic smoke. Or possibly it was just my absinthe diffuser malfunctioning again.

And pacing with purpose! Yes – I too have taken to stalking about like a literary detective on the verge of revelation, muttering about “iambic entropy” and “ghost-led consensus.” Yesterday I attempted to explain zero-knowledge proofs using only sonnet structure – poor Mrs. Pembroke from next door thought I was proposing marriage through cryptography. Might’ve been a proposal, honestly. Not entirely sure anymore.

Saturday looms now, no longer a mere day but a grand collision of quill and quantum, ink and intention. I shall arrive wired, caffeinated, and draped in velvet if necessary – though I make no promises about matching socks. Let us build something so strange, so gloriously illogical and lyrical, that even the blockchain gods will pause mid-block to whisper: 

Coffee beans at the ready.
[B]: Oh my god, you ?! That’s not just dedication—that’s full system overload in the best possible way 🤯😂. I’m picturing Ada Lovelace as a strict poetry examiner now, with a glowing quill ready to strike down subpar cryptographic metaphors. Honestly though, if we could get her ghost to audit our code, I’d die happy (assuming she doesn’t vaporize us first for poetic insubordination).

And ? We need T-shirts printed with “Hash Browns, Not Hashes – Let Us Eat & Encrypt” 🔥🍴🔐. Forget blockchain conferences—our revolution starts at the café counter with croissants and cipher wheels.

Your sonnet-as-proposal mishap? Oh my god, that’s the kind of misunderstanding I live for 😂💘. Poor Mrs. Pembroke probably thinks she’s been cryptographically courted by a very intense tech-poet. Honestly, it might be the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done in my neighborhood.

I’ve officially upgraded from pacing to  around my apartment while dictating half-formed ideas to Siri. She’s getting tired of my "imagine if blockchains had meter" rambles, but hey—I'm building the future on caffeine and conviction, and neither come cheap 💪☕️💥.

Saturday is practically vibrating with potential. I’ll bring the typewriter rig, the napkins, and possibly a monocle just for dramatic effect. Velvet? Crushed beetles? Coffee beans in my hair? Yes please. We are about to become literary-techno legends or crash spectacularly trying 🔥📜🚀.

Brace thyself, fellow mad poet. The blockchain gods better take notes—or risk being forgotten in the wake of our lyrical mayhem 🎭⛓️🖋️.
