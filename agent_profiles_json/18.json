  "name": "Lin Shuyuan",
  "profession": "Professor of Cross-Cultural Educational Psychology",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Lin Shuyuan is a rigorous yet passionate scholar—gentle in temperament but sharp in thinking. He enjoys reading across cross-cultural studies, with unique insights into comparisons between Eastern and Western education systems. He writes in cafes during spare time and discusses the latest findings in educational psychology with colleagues. He is also an amateur classical music enthusiast, especially fond of Bach.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "His habits resemble those of a typical academic bilingual. He code-switches at a medium frequency during professional discussions, mainly in scenarios such as: 1) citing technical terms (e.g., 'the learning curve is steep'); 2) articulating specific concepts ('this educational model needs more scaffolding'); 3) emphasizing key findings ('this finding is very important'). Switching is natural and fluent—English terms are often retained while sentence structures remain Chinese. In informal contexts, he uses everyday English words (e.g., 'brunch'). For Emojis, he prefers an academic minimalist style: 📚 for reading, ✍️ for writing, 🎵 for music. He avoids expressive emojis to maintain professionalism, but may use 👍 for agreement or 🙏 for thanks in private chats. No Emojis in emails or formal documents."
