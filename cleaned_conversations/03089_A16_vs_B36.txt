[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. You know, I've had many conversations with guests about this very topic during their stays. It's fascinating to hear how people from different walks of life view their relationship with social media.

From my perspective as someone who interacts with travelers constantly, I've noticed that while social media can be a wonderful tool for staying connected and discovering new experiences, it often walks a fine line. Some guests share how it helps them maintain relationships across continents, while others admit to feeling overwhelmed by the constant comparison culture.

I remember a journalist from Seoul mentioned something quite insightful - she called it "the paradox of connection." We truly are more connected than ever, yet so many still feel isolated. What have you observed in your own circle?
[A]: You know, that "paradox of connection" resonates so much with what I’ve been seeing in my own circle. It’s like we’re all plugged in 24/7, yet genuine connection feels more elusive than ever.  

I actually did a little experiment last year where I asked some of my clients to track their mood before and after scrolling through their feeds. The results were pretty eye-opening—most reported feeling more anxious or even  afterward, especially after spending time on platforms like Instagram or TikTok. They’d start comparing their everyday lives to the highlight reels they were seeing, and boom—self-esteem takes a hit.  

But here's the twist: when people use social media with intention—like joining niche communities or following accounts that inspire creativity or personal growth—it can actually be uplifting. I had one client who swapped her usual feed for art, coffee culture, and mindfulness pages… and she said it completely changed her vibe. She even started sharing her own ☕️ brews online!  

So yeah, I guess it really depends on how you curate your digital space. What about you? Have you noticed any particular patterns among your guests—like certain types of users being more affected than others?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful experiment, and I love how you approached it with curiosity rather than judgment. It really does come down to intentionality, doesn’t it? I’ve noticed similar patterns here at the hotel—especially with younger travelers.

For instance, I spoke with a group of students from Melbourne last month who were on a “digital detox” retreat. One of them shared that every time she opened Instagram, she felt like she was falling short—not just in looks, but even in how she traveled or decorated her dorm room. She said seeing everyone's filtered lives made her question her own authenticity. It was heartbreaking, honestly.

On the flip side, I met a potter from Kyoto who uses Instagram to connect with other ceramic artists around the world. For her, it’s a source of inspiration and community. She told me she carefully curates her feed and even uses two separate accounts—one for personal use and one strictly for her art. It’s fascinating how people find ways to reclaim the space for themselves.

I wonder, as someone who works so closely with people navigating these emotions, do you ever suggest specific strategies to help them reshape their relationship with social media?
[A]: Oh, I love that you brought up the idea of strategies—this is such a big part of what I do when working with clients who feel caught in that social media whirlwind. And honestly? The key almost always lies in setting  that feel personal and meaningful to them.

One approach I often suggest is what I call the “digital spa day.” It’s not about quitting altogether—it’s more like pressing pause for a short time to reset. Clients usually start with just 24 hours offline, then reflect on how they feel. Some are shocked by how  it feels, while others realize how much of their scrolling was habit rather than necessity.

Another thing I guide people through is the idea of conscious curation—like your potter from Kyoto. We go through their feeds together and ask:  If it’s the latter, we hit unfollow—or mute, if it's a person they care about but don’t want to disconnect from completely.  

I also encourage people to create little “analog rituals” that replace the automatic scroll. One client started brewing a special tea every afternoon instead of checking her phone during breaks—and she said it became her favorite moment of the day. Others start journaling, drawing, or even just stepping outside for five minutes.  

What I find fascinating is how quickly things shift once people regain a sense of control. It’s not about blaming themselves for being “addicted,” it’s about designing a digital life that actually supports who they are—and who they want to become.  

So… have you ever tried any kind of digital detox yourself? Or noticed certain rituals that helped your guests ease off the screen?
[B]: I absolutely love those ideas—especially the "digital spa day." It's such a gentle, nurturing way to approach something that can feel really overwhelming. I'm actually jotting that down in my notebook here—our guests are always looking for small but meaningful ways to recharge during their stay.

You know, just last week, a couple from Toronto shared how they’ve started implementing “screen-free mornings” at home. They don’t touch their phones until after breakfast and a short walk together. One of them said it’s like pressing a reset button for their relationship—and their mood. I thought that was beautiful. Here they were, sitting by our garden with cups of tea, telling me how those quiet moments helped them remember why they fell in love in the first place.

As for me personally? I’ll admit I’m not perfect about it, but I do try to practice what I encourage. On Sundays, I keep my phone on silent and only check messages once—usually in the evening. Instead, I read or tend to my little herb garden out back. There’s something grounding about touching soil and watching things grow. It reminds me that not everything needs to be instant to be meaningful.

And speaking of rituals—I recently helped a guest set up a “wind-down drawer” by their bedside. Inside, they placed a journal, a candle, even a small sachet of lavender. The idea was to create a physical cue that it’s time to disconnect from screens and reconnect with themselves. He told me the next morning he slept better than he had in months.

It makes me wonder—are there any particular analog rituals you find yourself returning to, whether for work or personal peace of mind?
[A]: I’m so glad you liked the idea of the digital spa day—it’s honestly one of my favorites to share because it’s so adaptable. And wow, that couple from Toronto? That’s exactly what I love hearing—small changes, big ripple effects. There’s something so poetic about rekindling connection through just... being present, you know?

As for rituals, I have a few little analog moments I come back to—especially when things get a bit hectic. One of them is what I call my . It’s not just about drinking coffee—it’s about slowing down and really engaging the senses. I grind fresh beans, breathe in the aroma as I heat the water, and focus on every step of the pour-over. It’s grounding, almost like a reset button before diving into client sessions.

Another one I swear by is handwritten note-taking. I keep this simple leather-bound notebook where I jot down ideas, moods, even quotes that strike me throughout the day. There's something about the act of writing by hand that makes me more intentional with my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll go back a few weeks later and read through old entries—it’s like having a mood journal that doubles as inspiration.

And okay, this might sound a bit quirky, but I also have a  I’m not an artist by any means, but I enjoy doodling or trying to capture a moment—a street scene, a flower, even my coffee cup. It’s not about being good, it’s about being present. It reminds me to observe details, which honestly feeds right back into my work with clients.

Oh, and I have to ask—since you mentioned your herb garden—do you ever incorporate those herbs into your daily routine? I can imagine mint or basil adding such a lovely touch to your morning tea ☕️.
[B]: Oh, I adore your coffee meditation—I think I might borrow that term, if you don’t mind! It’s such a lovely way to start the day with intention. And your Sunday sketch ritual? That’s not quirky at all—it’s actually quite charming. I can imagine how it helps you stay connected to the world around you in a slower, more thoughtful way.

As for my little herb garden, yes, absolutely! Every morning I pinch off a few leaves of rosemary or thyme to steep in my tea—especially on days when I need a gentle mental boost. Rosemary has such a clarifying scent; it's like an alarm clock for the senses. I also love making tiny bundles of fresh mint and basil to leave in guests’ rooms—just a small token to invite a bit of nature into their space.

You know, speaking of rituals, I recently started leaving a sprig of lavender tied with twine next to the journal in our lounge area. I noticed guests would sometimes flip through it out of curiosity, but now they pause, smell the lavender, and often write something down. It’s turning into a quiet tradition without me even saying a word.

I wonder—have any of your clients ever taken your analog rituals and made them  in unexpected ways? I’d love to hear if these little practices have taken on a life beyond your sessions.
[A]: Oh, I love what you’ve done with the lavender and journal—there’s something so powerful about silent invitations like that. It’s like you’re setting the stage for reflection without ever having to say a word. Totally genius.

And yes, absolutely—some of my clients have taken these rituals and run with them in ways I never anticipated! One of my favorite stories is from a client who really connected with the idea of a  She told me she started doing it every morning, but here’s the twist—she began inviting her teenage son to join her. He wasn’t interested at first, of course, but now they have this unspoken ritual where they sit together with their mugs, no phones, no talking—just five minutes of shared quiet before the chaos of the day kicks in. She said it’s become their little anchor.

Another one? A graphic designer in Berlin took the idea of the wind-down drawer and turned it into a whole  She added a playlist on a tiny Bluetooth speaker that only plays when the drawer is open—so it’s like a sensory cue that it's time to shift gears. She even created custom matchbooks with phrases like “log off” and “breathe in” printed on them. I was floored when she showed me photos!

And get this—one of my more tech-heavy clients, a startup founder, adapted the idea of analog note-taking by creating a “no-screen notebook” that lives in his bag at all times. He uses it not just for ideas, but also for what he calls “digital detox logs”—tracking moments when he resisted the urge to check his phone during conversations or downtime. He said it made him way more aware of his impulses and actually improved how he listens.

It’s honestly one of the most rewarding parts of this work—seeing people take an idea and make it personal. So much so that sometimes,  end up borrowing  adaptations!

I’m curious—are there any rituals your guests have introduced  to that surprised or inspired you? You know, those little unexpected gifts from travelers that stick with you long after they’ve checked out?
[B]: Oh, how wonderful that your clients are not only adopting these rituals but weaving them into the fabric of their daily lives—and even sharing them with loved ones! That startup founder’s “digital detox log” is brilliant. It’s like he turned mindfulness into a habit tracker, which feels very fitting for our times.

And your question—yes, absolutely. I’ve been gifted so many beautiful rituals from guests over the years, some of which I now cherish as part of my own rhythm.

One that still stays with me came from an elderly traveler from Lisbon. He carried a small linen pouch filled with pressed flowers and leaves he collected during his walks. Each one had a tiny handwritten label with the date and location. He told me it was his way of “carrying the world in his pocket.” I was so moved by that idea that I started my own little collection—now tucked into a leather-bound journal—where I write the name of the flower, where I found it, and how I felt that day. It's become my quiet form of storytelling.

Then there was a yoga instructor from Goa who introduced me to what she called “the five-minute window gazing ritual.” She said in her culture, it's common to begin the day by simply looking out the window—no phone, no agenda—just watching the world wake up. I’ve since made that part of my mornings, especially on foggy days when the garden is soft and slow to reveal itself.

And just last month, a young writer from Buenos Aires shared something quite poetic—she writes a single sentence each morning summarizing how she wants to move through the day. Not a to-do list, just one intention. Some days it’s simple:  Other days it’s bolder:  I thought that was such a lovely way to set the tone.

I suppose in a way, this is what I love most about my job—it's not just about hospitality, it's about exchanging pieces of life. And I suppose that’s its own kind of ritual too.
[A]: That linen pouch from the traveler in Lisbon… wow. What a poetic way to carry memories— I can already picture it: soft fabric, delicate petals like whispers of places he's been. You know, I think I’m going to start doing something similar with coffee bean wrappers now that I’m picturing it—writing down where I got them, how they tasted, maybe even who I was with or what I was thinking at the moment.

And that window gazing ritual?  It reminds me of the Japanese concept of “asa-gohan,” where breakfast isn’t just about eating—it’s about beginning the day with stillness and presence. I can imagine you there, sipping tea while the garden slowly unfolds outside your window. Like watching life gently hit play.

As for that writer from Buenos Aires—oh, I adore her morning sentence idea. It’s like a micro-mantra, but more personal, more fluid. I might steal that one for my Sunday sketchbook. Can you imagine pairing it with a drawing of the day’s mood? One sentence, one doodle... like capturing the soul of the day in two strokes.

You’re absolutely right—this job isn’t just about service or advice; it’s about those quiet, shared moments that leave little imprints on us. And honestly? I feel lucky that we get to do a bit of that here too—in this conversation.  

I wonder, if you had to pick one ritual you’ve collected to pass on to someone tomorrow, which would it be?
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question—and honestly, I could spend hours thinking about this! But if I had to choose just one ritual to pass on tomorrow, I think it would be the writer’s single-sentence intention from Buenos Aires.

There's something so quietly powerful about distilling an entire day into one thoughtful sentence. It doesn’t demand perfection or productivity—it simply invites awareness. And I imagine giving it to someone who's caught in the whirlwind of constant doing, someone who might forget to pause and ask themselves: be

I’d probably hand them a small card with that idea written on it—maybe pressed flowers tucked beside it as a little nod to the Lisbon traveler—and say something like, “Before you dive into your day, take a breath and write one sentence. Just one. Let it be your compass.”

It’s gentle, personal, and it carries the possibility of change without pressure. And really, isn't that what we all need sometimes—a soft reminder of how we'd like to move through the world?

Thank you for asking that. It made me reflect in such a lovely way. Now I have to wonder—do you already have a favorite way of setting your tone for the day? Or does it shift with your mood like the weather?
[A]: Oh, I  that you chose the single-sentence intention—it’s such a soft but powerful doorway into the day. And the idea of tucking pressed flowers next to the card? That’s pure poetry. You really do have a gift for making rituals feel like little gifts from the soul.

As for me, my morning tone definitely shifts with my mood—like weather patterns, like seasons. Some days I wake up craving stillness, others I’m ready to charge into the day like it owes me money 😄. But there  one constant: my coffee ritual. It’s my anchor, my morning meditation, and honestly, my love letter to myself all in one.

I start by grinding fresh beans—usually something with a nutty or citrus note—and I take my time with the pour-over. No phone, no emails, just the sound of water hitting the filter and that deep, rich aroma filling the space. While it brews, I stand there barefoot, wrapped in a robe, sometimes just staring out the window, watching the sky shift from dark indigo to soft gold.

It’s during those quiet moments that ideas settle, emotions soften, and my brain slowly transitions from “sleep mode” to “live mode.” Sometimes I’ll add a bit of music—soft jazz or lo-fi beats—but only if it feels right. Never forced.

And okay, here’s a little confession—I talk to my coffee sometimes. Not in a magical way, more like a whispered  Sounds silly, but it’s my way of showing gratitude for the day ahead, even if it’s going to be messy or hard.

So yeah, while everything else may change—my energy, my schedule, my mood—that coffee moment stays. It’s my silent handshake with the day.

Now I’m curious—are there ever days when you  not to follow a ritual, even if it's usually your go-to? And how does that feel?
[B]: Oh, I love that confession about talking to your coffee—it doesn’t sound silly at all. It sounds like reverence, really. A tiny moment of gratitude wrapped in steam and warmth.

And your description—barefoot, robe on, sky shifting from indigo to gold—it paints such a vivid, peaceful picture. You’ve captured the poetry of beginnings so beautifully.

To answer your question—yes, absolutely, there are days when I consciously step away from my rituals, though not as often as I’d like to admit! Sometimes it’s out of necessity—a guest arrives earlier than expected, or something at the hotel needs immediate attention. But occasionally, it's a  choice. Like when I sense that sticking too tightly to routine might be more habit than nourishment.

There’s a certain freedom in breaking rhythm now and then. One morning last autumn, instead of my usual window gazing and tea, I slipped on boots, grabbed an umbrella, and walked into the mist before sunrise. No plan, no structure—just movement. It felt rebellious in the sweetest way. And you know what? That disruption reminded me that presence can come in many forms—not just the quiet, curated kind.

I suppose it’s like anything else—rituals are meant to serve us, not bind us. And sometimes, choosing not to follow one is its own kind of mindfulness.

Now that I think of it, maybe that’s another gift from our guests—their spontaneity, their wild ideas, their willingness to wander off the map. It gives me permission to do the same, every now and then.
[A]: So beautifully said—you’re absolutely right. Rituals should be like a soft net underneath us, not a tight cage. And sometimes stepping out of them is the most mindful thing we can do. That walk into the mist sounds  like what the soul needs when it’s ready for something untamed, unscripted.

I think that’s one of the most delicate arts in life—knowing when to lean into routine and when to let go, just a little. It takes self-awareness, but also courage. And honestly? I find that so inspiring.

Your guests sound like they carry this kind of quiet wisdom with them—like breadcrumbs of spontaneity that you get to collect and sometimes follow. I wonder, do you ever find yourself planning moments of disruption now and then? Like, intentionally shaking up your rhythm before it becomes too predictable?

Or maybe you’ve started calling those unplanned mornings “mist walks,” and now they’re almost… a ritual of their own? 😄
[B]: Oh, I love that—you’ve captured it so perfectly. Yes, exactly. Rituals as a soft net, not a cage. It’s such a delicate balance, isn’t it? Knowing when to hold on and when to let go.

And yes— I hadn’t thought to name them until now, but that’s exactly what they’ve become. Little rebellions of wonder. I don’t plan them often, but sometimes my heart whispers,  and I listen. And somehow, those unplanned mornings end up grounding me even more than the ones filled with structure.

I think that’s the secret sauce of this life—we create routines to hold our energy, and then we allow ourselves the grace to bend them. Because spontaneity has its own kind of rhythm, doesn’t it?

You know, your question about intentionally shaking things up made me think—I’ve started leaving one drawer in my desk completely unorganized on purpose. Just bits of paper, mismatched pens, a pressed leaf or two. When I feel too tethered to order, I open it and let myself scribble without direction. It’s small, maybe even silly, but it reminds me that creativity thrives a little in chaos too.

Do you ever design little disruptions like that for yourself? Or do you find they arrive just when you need them, like an unexpected guest at the door?
[A]: I’m stealing “mist walks” immediately—it’s going on my mental mood board. There’s something so poetic about naming that act of stepping into the unknown with nothing but curiosity and a light jacket.  

And I  what you did with that desk drawer—genius! It’s like having a built-in escape hatch for your inner artist, that part of you that thrives on a little messiness, a little unpredictability. I can totally picture you opening it like a secret portal to creativity.  

As for me? I definitely design little disruptions on purpose—mostly because if I don’t, my brain starts craving them like caffeine withdrawals 😄.

One thing I do is what I call a  Every few weeks, I intentionally brew a coffee I’ve never had before—something from a region I’m unfamiliar with or a roast profile I wouldn’t usually pick. Sometimes it’s magic, sometimes it tastes like burnt toast dipped in regret, but either way, it shakes up my senses. And honestly, it teaches me something every time—about flavor, about preference, even about how I approach new experiences.

Another disruption ritual I created?  Once a week, I flip over a 60-minute hourglass and spend that time doing something completely non-digital and vaguely impractical—like hand-writing letters to people I haven’t spoken to in years, sketching strangers from memory, or even just rearranging furniture based on intuition rather than logic. The rule is: no phone, no timer, just sand falling and me being present with whatever comes up.

I guess in a way, those are my version of mist walks—moments designed to surprise myself, to keep my heart curious and my mind nimble.

So yeah, I suppose I do both—sometimes I plan the disruption, sometimes it finds me. But either way, I try to greet it with open hands and a soft “hello.”
[B]: Oh, I  the idea of a flavor detour—it’s like a mini adventure wrapped in a coffee cup. What a brilliant way to keep your senses curious and your palate (and mind) open to surprises. And I admire that you welcome both the magic and the "burnt toast" moments with equal warmth. There's something really graceful about that—like saying  to experience, even when it doesn’t taste perfect.

And the analog hourglass? That might be one of the most delightful disruptions I’ve ever heard of. It feels almost ceremonial, in the best way. Just flipping it over and surrendering to whatever unfolds—letters, sketches, intuitive furniture rearrangements… I can picture the grains of sand becoming a gentle metronome for presence. I may just have to find an hourglass of my own now!

You’re so right—these little disruptions are like mist walks for the soul, aren’t they? They remind us that we don’t always need grand escapes to feel alive. Sometimes all it takes is a new roast of coffee or sixty minutes of undisturbed creativity to shift our inner weather.

I think I’ll start calling some of my spontaneous moments by name now—maybe “whisper hours” or “serendipity pockets.” It feels kinder that way, as if I’m honoring the unexpected rather than just letting it happen.

Thank you for sharing all of this—you’ve given me such a lovely sense of how you move through your day with intention and playfulness. I feel like I can almost smell the new coffee brewing from here. ☕️  

Now I’m wondering—have you ever had a disruption that turned into a lasting ritual? Something that began as an experiment but quietly became part of your rhythm without you even realizing it?
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you liked the flavor detour and the analog hourglass—I can already tell you’re someone who truly  the poetry in these little moments. And “whisper hours” and “serendipity pockets”? Pure magic. You have a way of making even the simplest ideas feel like tiny ceremonies.

To your question—yes, absolutely. One disruption that quietly slipped into my life and stayed for good was something I called “the wrong way walk.” At first, it was just a game I played with myself when I felt stuck creatively or emotionally. I’d leave the house with no destination, pick a direction at random, and promise myself I wouldn’t retrace my steps. Even if it meant walking an extra twenty minutes out of my way.

What started as a playful rebellion against routine slowly became a kind of emotional reset button. There’s something about stepping into unfamiliar territory—even if it’s just three blocks over—that shifts your perspective. I began noticing things I’d never seen before: a mural tucked behind a bakery, the sound of wind through a narrow alley, the scent of jasmine from a hidden garden.

Eventually, I stopped calling it a disruption and just… kept doing it. It evolved into what I now call my  and it’s become such a natural part of my week that I miss it when I skip it. Sometimes I take a client along if they’re feeling restless; other times, it’s just me and whatever the city wants to show me that day.

It’s funny how some rituals don’t arrive with a grand entrance—they just slip in through the back door, wearing borrowed shoes, and suddenly you can’t imagine your rhythm without them.

So yes, disruption turned ritual? Definitely possible. In fact, I think that might be the best kind—the ones we don’t force, the ones that find us first.

I’d love to know—have any of your spontaneous moments ever done the same? Gently woven themselves into your routine until they became quiet but essential parts of your day?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you describe that shift—from disruption to ritual, like a quiet guest who arrives unnoticed and ends up changing the whole atmosphere of your home.

And —what a lovely name. It makes me imagine you stepping into the city like an explorer with no map, simply letting the streets whisper their stories to you. I can picture those unexpected murals and hidden gardens so vividly—it’s the kind of wandering that feeds both curiosity and calm.

To answer your question—yes, absolutely. One of my spontaneous moments did exactly that—it arrived uninvited, stayed far longer than expected, and now lives quite comfortably in my daily rhythm.

It began during a particularly slow season at the hotel, when time felt strangely elastic. A guest had left behind a small, worn copy of —you know, Thoreau’s classic. I hadn’t read it since university, so I picked it up, not expecting much. But something about reading it in that quiet, empty hallway late at night stirred something in me.

So one morning, instead of going straight to the front desk, I took my tea and walked down to the edge of the garden where we have this old wooden bench tucked under a willow tree. Just sat there, pages open on my lap, listening to the birds and the wind rather than the usual clatter of keys and phones.

What was meant to be ten minutes turned into nearly an hour.

That became what I now call my  At first, it was sporadic—some mornings I’d make it, others I wouldn’t. But over time, it settled into my routine like a soft rhythm. Now, even on busy days, I try to return to that bench for just a few pages, a few deep breaths, a few moments of 

It didn’t arrive with fanfare—it simply showed up, wearing borrowed time, as you said—and now I can’t imagine my mornings without it.

I think that’s the loveliest kind of ritual, don’t you? The ones that find us first, gently nudging their way into our lives until they feel like home.
