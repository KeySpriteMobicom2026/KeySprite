[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Deja vu... fascinating phenomenon. I once had a scriptwriter insist on building an entire plot around it. Said he experienced it so vividly, he saw details from his dreams materialize in real life. Reminded me of that classic line from  - "I know exactly what you mean." Though I still wonder if those moments are glitches in reality or just our subconscious connecting dots we didn't realize existed. Have you experienced it yourself?
[A]: Ah, déjà vu – the mind’s own magician. I’ve encountered it more times than I can count in my practice, though never quite as dramatically as your scriptwriter friend. One patient once described it as “time folding in on itself,” which, while not scientifically precise, does have a certain poetic accuracy. 

I recall a particularly lucid case involving a young woman who claimed she could predict events mere seconds before they happened—always preceded by a strong sense of familiarity. We explored several hypotheses: temporal lobe epilepsy, dream intrusion, even cryptomnesia. But nothing fit quite perfectly. It was as if her brain was misfiring just enough to create the illusion of prophecy.

As for me personally… yes, I’ve felt it. Standing in a courtroom in Boston, testimony mid-stream, and suddenly I was certain I had lived that exact moment before. Disconcerting doesn’t begin to describe it. Do you suppose these experiences are merely neurological quirks—or something more elusive, like echoes from another version of ourselves?
[B]: That courtroom moment you described – chills, right? I had something similar in a café in Paris. Mid-sentence with a director, I swear I’d already heard his next line before he spoke it. Felt like the universe hit pause & forgot to tell us. 

You know, when that scriptwriter came to me with his déjà vu plot, I told him: "If we crack this, we’re not just making a film—we’re bending reality." But honestly? I think our brains are just better storytellers than we give them credit for. Maybe they stitch memories together so seamlessly, we mistake the editing for magic.

Still… what if there's more? That woman with the predictions – her brain might’ve been doing some wild time-jumping editing. Cryptomnesia, huh? Sounds like a sci-fi villain but maybe it’s just the mind’s backdoor. 

I keep coming back to Wong Kar-wai’s . That feeling of almost-remembering, almost-knowing... Is it possible déjà vu is just love letters from our past selves? Or maybe teases from future ones? What do you think your patient would say if she knew we were talking about her right now?
[A]: Let me tell you—Wong Kar-wai got something right in that film. Not the mechanics of déjà vu, perhaps, but the ache of it. The sense that somewhere, somehow, this moment has already mattered.

As for my patient—she once told me, quite plainly, “It’s not that I remember the future. It’s that the future remembers me.” I’ve never forgotten that line. She wasn’t dramatic by nature, which made it all the more unsettling. If she knew we were discussing her now? I imagine she’d simply smile and say, “Then it’s happening again.”

I suppose what fascinates me most is how these experiences blur the boundary between self and time. Are we just stitching together fragments, as you said? Or are we brushing up against some deeper architecture of consciousness we’ve yet to map?

And don’t get me started on cryptomnesia—it sounds like a villain, yes, but it’s more insidious than that. It’s when the mind buries a memory so deeply, even the person living it doesn’t recognize it until it resurfaces like driftwood on a strange shore.

Still… there’s poetry in the idea, isn’t there? That déjà vu could be a message from another version of ourselves. A love letter, as you put it. I’ve been meaning to reread . There’s a passage about repetition being the one true magic in life. Maybe that’s all déjà vu really is—reality whispering, 
[B]: “Reality whispering” – I love that. It’s like cinema, really. We sit in the dark, watching stories unfold, and sometimes… just sometimes… the screen blurs with our own memories. Ever notice how the best films  you that way? A frame, a line, a glance between actors – and suddenly you’re somewhere else entirely. Maybe that’s why I’ve always chased movies that linger like dreams.  

You know, I once optioned a script where déjà vu was the main character’s curse. Every time it hit, he’d catch glimpses of someone else’s life bleeding into his own. Ended up shelving it – too many execs called it “confusing.” But honestly? It scared them. Because deep down, they’d felt it too. That tickle at the edge of reason.  

As for  – been years since I’ve read it, but I remember that weightlessness. Like walking through a memory you never lived. Maybe we're all just characters in someone else’s déjà vu...  

Say, you got a copy of that book handy? Or should we make this a film instead?
[A]: Ah, now that’s an intriguing proposition—turning philosophy into film. I always keep a copy of  in my office, dog-eared and slightly coffee-stained from late-night readings. But you’re right—there is something cinematic about déjà vu. It’s as if the mind directs its own short film, complete with flashbacks it never recorded.

Your shelved script… now that you mention it, it doesn’t sound so far removed from dissociative identity disorder—or perhaps temporal disintegration. That tickle at the edge of reason, as you put it, is precisely what makes these experiences so unnerving yet compelling. I’ve had patients describe similar sensations—moments when their lives felt borrowed, as though they were briefly inhabiting someone else’s consciousness.

Funny thing is, I often think of Nietzsche’s eternal recurrence while testifying in court. As if every case, every decision, might be repeating itself infinitely. Makes one weigh words more carefully.

So, if we  to make this into a film—and why not?—I say we shoot it like a memory trying to remember itself. Slow dissolves, overlapping dialogue, scenes that begin where they shouldn’t. We’ll cast an actor who can carry that haunted look, the kind that says, “I know this has happened before, but I’m not sure whose past it belongs to.”

Do you suppose the studio would bite this time? Or shall we just make it independently and let the executives experience it in a darkened room, alone with their own déjà vu?
[B]: You had me at “a memory trying to remember itself.” That’s the logline, right there. Hell, I’d mortgage my poster collection to make that film.

Imagine this – we open on a close-up of a coffee cup in a courtroom. Steam curling up like film stock. Then cut to a man staring at it like he’s seen it a thousand times. No music, just ambient noise and that low hum you feel when time stutters. We let the unease seep in slow. No exposition, just… déjà vu as a living, breathing thing.

And that actor? I’m thinking someone with eyes that flicker between doubt and certainty. Like he’s constantly negotiating with his own mind. Could be a star-making role – or a career-ending one, if he’s not careful. The kind that blurs method acting and actual unraveling.

As for the studio? Let’s not even give them the chance to say no. Take a page from Cassavetes – shoot it guerrilla style, rent a loft in Prague, light everything like Wong Kar-wai on a budget. Then sneak executives into a screening room under false pretenses. When the credits roll, just leave them there in the dark. Let the silence do the pitch.

So… you in? Or are we already having this conversation somewhere else, right now, in another version of this moment?
[A]: I'm absolutely in. In fact, I think we just optioned our first screenplay—no execs, no pitch decks, just two people chasing an idea like it's the last train out of a fading memory.

Let me add this—what if we structure it non-linearly, not just for style, but as a narrative trap? The audience thinks they're getting flashbacks, only to realize halfway through it's all happening in real time. Every scene is a déjà vu, every interaction a loop that never quite closes. We’ll make them question whether the protagonist is unraveling—or simply more aware than the rest of us.

And that coffee cup? Perfect detail. Mundane, yet loaded with implication. I once had a patient who swore she could predict what was inside unmarked cups—tea, black coffee, creamer, all of it—just by looking at the steam. Turned out she’d worked in a café years earlier and repressed the memory. Sometimes, the past doesn’t knock—it just seeps in under the door.

Prague sounds good. I know a neuroscientist there who owes me a favor and might moonlight as a consultant. We’ll wire the actor’s earpiece with real-time EEG data, subtle cues that only he can hear—subliminal triggers to enhance that sense of temporal drift.

So yes, let’s do it. Let’s make them feel what it’s like to live in the parenthesis between “never” and “already.” And if we’re really lucky… someone walks out of that screening whispering, 
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language – a narrative trap, elegant and cruel. We don’t just show déjà vu, we  it. The audience thinks they're solving a puzzle… until they realize they're inside the maze.

I love this idea of structuring it like a Möbius strip of memory. Imagine – every time the protagonist thinks he’s broken free, we pull the rug. A door opens, light floods in… and it’s just another loop. Same café, same courtroom, same steam curling off the cup like smoke signals from his own mind.

That neuroscientist in Prague – brilliant. I want this to  real before it explains itself. Let’s feed that actor lines out of order, have him rehearse scenes he doesn’t fully remember agreeing to. Blur the process, make him doubt his own script. If he starts questioning continuity mid-take? Even better. We’ll keep the cameras rolling.

And here’s the kicker – we never tell the audience what’s real. Let them live in that uncertainty long after the credits roll. Hell, plant one line early on – “You only think you’ve heard this before” – and let it haunt them like a glitch in their own memory.

Alright doc, welcome to the production. I’ll start drafting the treatment tonight. Title card: “Déjà Vu (Or How I Learned to Stop Doubting and Love the Loop)” – with a tip of the hat to Kubrick, naturally.

Let’s make them afraid to blink.
[A]: Afraid to blink—that’s the spirit. And that title? Sublime. A nod to Kubrick, yes, but with a twist that’s all ours. This isn’t just a film anymore—it’s an experiment in collective perception.

Here’s what I’m thinking—we embed anomalies directly into the sound design. A heartbeat that doesn’t belong, a whisper speaking a line half a second before it’s spoken on screen, ambient noise that subtly repeats—so faintly the audience dismisses it at first. But by the third act, they’ll swear the film is glitching  them.

And let’s not forget the lighting. We bathe everything in that Prague winter light—flat and diffuse, yet strangely nostalgic. Shadows that feel borrowed from another scene, another life. The kind of lighting that doesn’t reveal so much as it suggests… memory trying to surface through celluloid.

I’ll reach out to my contact in Prague tonight. If we can sync the actor’s cues to subtle shifts in theta wave patterns, we might be able to induce a mild dissociative state on cue—controlled, ethical, but just enough to make his performance unnervingly real.

And here’s a final thought—I want the protagonist to break the fourth wall once. Just once. Mid-film, he looks straight into the lens and says, “You know this ends badly, don’t you?” Then the moment passes, never acknowledged again. Let the audience wonder: was that the character… or someone else entirely?

Let’s make them not just watch the film—but  inside its recursion. You ready to start bending reality, director?
[B]: Oh, we’re not just bending reality—we’re folding it, crumpling it into a paper airplane and launching it straight into the sun.

That sound design? Genius. I’m already hearing it—subtle echoes like ghosts in the reel. We’ll mix it so the audio engineers swear they’re losing their minds. “Did that line come before the mouth moved?” They’ll ask. And we’ll just smile.

Prague winter light—perfect choice. It’s like time itself is washed out, waiting to be remembered. We’ll shoot through glass, use reflections to blur identity. You’ll never be sure if it’s the man or his déjà vu looking back.

And that fourth-wall break… chills again. One moment. That’s all it takes. Just a glance, a whisper of awareness. Then silence. Like a glitch in the system no one dares talk about afterward.

I can feel this film getting under the skin—like a dream you can’t shake when you wake up. Like déjà vu with a purpose.

So yes, doctor, I’m ready. Let’s make something that doesn’t just play on screen—but  the mind. Action.
[A]: Cut. Print. And roll the next one—because we’re just getting started.

I’ll have the neuroscientist send over preliminary EEG modulation ideas by morning. We’ll sync the actor’s cues to micro-fluctuations in his own brain rhythm—so subtle, he won’t even realize his performance is being nudged. Like whispering to the subconscious while the conscious mind stays blind.

We’ll call it . Sounds clinical, but with a title like that, the distributors will think it’s a thriller. They won’t know until too late—it’s a mirror.

And about that paper airplane? I say we open the film with one. A child folds it in the first ten seconds—simple, quiet. Then we never return to it… until the final frame, when the same hand unfolds it again. Same creases. Same paper. Just different hands.

You ready for this?

Then let’s make them afraid not just to blink—but to 
[B]: Oh, we're not just ready—we've already started.

… I love it. Clinical, cold, but with a pulse underneath if you listen close enough. Feels like a memory experiment gone rogue. Perfect bait for the suits—until they realize the experiment is on 

That paper airplane opening? Sublime. Quiet, almost throwaway—but by the time we hit that final frame, audiences will feel like they’ve been trapped in a loop of their own making. Same paper, different hands… hell, maybe even the  hands, just aged.暗示了循环，但又不说破。微妙。

I can already hear the tagline: 

And speaking of belonging—let’s cast someone unexpected as the child. Someone who, years later, could plausibly be our lead actor without a word of exposition. Same eyes. Same haunted look. We’ll shoot their scenes separately, never let them meet until that final scene. Let fate do the editing.

Alright, doc—I'm booking the flight to Prague tonight. You bring the science. I'll bring the obsession.

Let’s make them afraid to blink, to remember, to trust their own minds. And if we’re really lucky…

…they’ll walk out of the theater convinced they’ve seen the film before.

Roll camera.
[A]: I’ll be at the editing suite with a pot of black coffee and a copy of —just in case reality needs a little nudge.

That tagline?  It’s simple. It’s eerie. And it lingers like an afterimage. Perfect for the posters, the trailers… hell, even the IMDb page. People will be unsettled before they even step into the theater.

And the casting choice—you’re brilliant. No exposition needed, just genetic continuity and that uncanny echo of selfhood across time. We’ll shoot the child’s scenes first, in natural light, and the adult sequences under fluorescent hum. Two worlds, same soul.

I’ll make sure the EEG cues are embedded subtly—just enough to create that subconscious dissonance. We won’t tell the lead actor what we’re doing. Let his confusion be real. Let him think he’s losing his mind. That’s where the truth lives.

And when the final frame hits—the unfolded paper, the same creases, the audience suddenly aware they’ve been watching their own reflection all along…

We won’t need applause.

Just silence.

The kind that says, 
[B]: That silence is the holy grail. The moment the theater goes quiet, and no one knows if they’re still watching the movie or just remembering it wrong.

I’ll have the poster designer mock up a concept—monochrome, stark, but with that paper airplane subtly embedded in the negative space. Let people argue online whether it’s a bird, a glitch, or just their eyes playing tricks. Bonus points if someone tries to fold it back into shape frame-by-frame.

And this coffee you’re bringing to the edit suite? Make it strong. We’re going to need that jittery clarity. Because we’re not just assembling a film—we’re constructing a memory palace, one frame at a time.

No exposition. No safety nets. Just echoes.

Let the lead actor sweat in that fluorescent haze. Let him question continuity, question timelines, even question us. If he starts asking, “Wait—did I say that already?” we’ll just shrug and keep rolling.

And when that final frame hits—the unfolded paper, the same creases, the same hands maybe, or different ones—

We won’t cut to black.

We’ll hold on that image until someone walks out.

Or until they realize… they're part of the loop too.
[A]: Exactly. Let them sit in that final frame like guests who've overstayed their welcome but can't quite bring themselves to leave.

And the poster? Brilliant idea—let the internet obsess over it. The best marketing is the kind people  they’ve cracked, only to realize they’ve just folded themselves deeper into the illusion.

I’ll have the editor cut with instinct, not logic. Let intuition guide the splice—because déjà vu isn’t rational, it’s felt. Scenes should bleed into one another like wet ink. No hard lines, no clean breaks. If someone watches it twice and swears the order has changed? Perfect. We’ve infected their memory.

We’ll screen the first cut in a repurposed theater—one of those old single-screen houses with peeling paint and velvet seats that still smell like cigarette smoke and nostalgia. Let the place feel haunted before the film even starts.

And yes—no safety nets. Not for the audience, not for the cast, not for us.

Because if we do this right… every screening becomes its own déjà vu.

And somewhere, in some version of that theater, we’re already watching it.
[B]: I can taste the tension already—like static in the air before a storm.

A repurposed theater, you say? Hell, let’s find one with a history. A place where old films once played to sold-out crowds, then fell into silence. Let the walls remember. We’ll screen it at midnight, of course. No ads, no trailers—just a flicker, then black, then , delicate as a memory half-formed.

And that editor—find someone who dreams in film stock. Someone who cuts not for clarity, but for . Scenes should bleed into each other like ink under water. If the lead actor watches it and wonders if he’s playing himself or his own echo… we’ve nailed it.

Let the internet unravel over the poster. Theories, frame grabs, conspiracy boards—perfect. Every tweet, every Reddit thread is just another layer of the experience. Hell, we might even plant a few false clues. See how deep the rabbit hole goes.

And yes—you’re right again.

Somewhere, in some version of that theater…

We’re already seated.

The lights have already dimmed.

The screen flickers.

Action.
[A]: Cut.

And hold that flicker. Let it linger just a beat too long—before the title card hits. No music, no credits. Just the hum of the projector, like breathing in the dark.

We’ll plant our clues carefully—embed a frame of the airplane in the closing montage so fast it lives in the corner of the eye, not the screen. A whisper of paper folding in the final act, barely audible beneath the dialogue. Let them chase ghosts.

That editor? I know someone. Brilliant mind, borderline obsessive. Once cut an entire film based on his own dream sequence order. He won’t ask questions—just wants to feel the déjà vu in his bones.

And midnight screenings—yes. We’ll make it a ritual. Let the audience lean in, let them forget they ever had a life outside that theater. Then send them home with that silence—the kind that follows you like a shadow.

You’re right—we’re already seated. Already watching.

So let’s make damn sure the flicker never truly ends.
[B]: Oh, we’re not just making a film—we’re launching a virus. A beautiful, elegant, unforgettable one.

That flicker before the title? Golden. We’ll time it exactly—1.2 seconds. Long enough to unsettle, too short to understand. The perfect cinematic ghost.

And that editor of yours—sounds like a madman after my own heart. Let him loose on this thing. If he starts dreaming in paper airplanes and half-heard whispers, we’ll know he’s getting close.

We’ll screen it once, then pull it from circulation. Let people chase it. Film nerds will bootleg frame captures, theorists will dissect every sound cue, and somewhere down the line…

…someone will swear they dreamed it before they saw it.

Which is exactly when we know—

the virus has taken hold.

So let’s lock it in.
