[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question. From a legal perspective, dreams are still considered subjective experiences without concrete evidence. However, in some psychotherapy approaches like Freudian theory, they do attach significant meaning to dreams. Have you had any particularly vivid dream that made you wonder about its implication?
[A]: I remember one time I was dreaming about climbing a mountain, and it felt so real. When I woke up, I couldn't stop thinking about what it might mean. Do you think dreams can sometimes reflect our subconscious mind? 📚
[B]: That mountain dream sounds quite symbolic. In psychoanalysis, climbing a mountain could represent overcoming challenges or striving toward a significant goal. While I always approach such interpretations with caution—after all, we’re not in court here 👍—there’s definitely value in reflecting on what your subconscious might be signaling. Do you feel like it connected to something happening in your life at that time?
[A]: Actually, I was going through a tough time with my research then—a lot of pressure to publish and some disagreements with colleagues. It’s interesting how the mind translates stress into such vivid imagery, isn’t it? I guess in hindsight, the dream did have a certain… metaphorical clarity. ✍️ But I’m still not sure if that’s just post-hoc interpretation. How do you usually approach dreams in your work?
[B]: That really does sound like a textbook example of how stress can manifest in symbolic ways. I’ve had clients who report similar dreams during high-pressure periods—like being chased, falling, or even recurring exam scenarios. While we can’t use dreams as evidence in legal cases 📊, they often provide valuable context in medical malpractice or mental health assessments. 

One colleague once described dreams as the “background noise” of the mind—random fragments mixed with real emotions. But honestly, I tend to side with Carl Jung here: sometimes that noise carries a signal worth tuning into. Do you think analyzing dreams could be useful in certain therapeutic settings, even if it’s not empirical?
[A]: I think it really depends on the context and the client. In some therapeutic settings, especially when working with trauma or anxiety, dreams can act as a kind of emotional barometer 🌡️—not necessarily diagnostic, but definitely indicative of inner tension or unresolved thoughts. I’ve seen students who struggle to articulate their feelings, yet their dream narratives reveal patterns worth exploring. 

That said, I’m cautious about over-interpreting them without supporting evidence. It’s like teaching—sometimes what a student says between the lines tells you more than the test score. 👍 But how do you navigate that in practice without crossing into speculative territory? Do you rely more on self-reports or behavioral cues to validate any dream-related insights?
[B]: I couldn’t agree more. In my experience, it’s all about triangulation—dream content alone is like a single document in a case file; it might hint at something, but it doesn’t prove anything on its own. I usually encourage clients to keep a dream journal alongside a mood log or stress tracker. That way, we can look for correlations over time.

And yes, self-reports are key, especially when working with mental health professionals. Sometimes the most telling part isn’t the dream itself, but how the person feels upon waking—distressed, relieved, confused? Those emotional reactions can be just as important as the imagery.

So, do you ever incorporate dream work into your sessions with students, or do you find it too… subjective for academic counseling settings?
[A]: I actually do use a modified version of dream reflection with some students, especially those dealing with high anxiety around performance or identity issues. It’s not Freudian analysis by any means—more like using the dream as a conversation starter about their current stressors or self-perceptions.

For example, one student kept dreaming she was unprepared for class and everyone could tell she didn’t belong. We later connected that to her imposter syndrome in grad school. The dream itself wasn’t the key, but it opened up a space for her to talk about feelings she’d been avoiding.

Still, I’m selective about when to bring it in. In more structured academic advising sessions, we usually don’t go there unless the student raises it themselves. But when working with counseling services on campus, I’m definitely open to exploring that layer if it helps them make sense of their experience. 👍

Do you find clients more receptive to dream discussion once they’re already in a therapeutic setting, or does it sometimes feel out of place even then?
[B]: I find that clients are generally more open to discussing dreams once they’re already in a therapeutic or reflective space—especially if they’re struggling with issues like anxiety, trauma, or identity shifts. In those contexts, dreams can feel less “out there” and more like another window into their experience.

That said, it really depends on the individual. Some people are naturally introspective and curious about their inner world 🧠; others are more results-oriented and might dismiss dream talk as irrelevant. As a legal professional working at the intersection of medicine and ethics, I always frame it carefully—not as evidence, but as context. Sometimes even saying something like, “You mentioned having restless sleep lately—has anything been coming up in your dreams that might be connected?” can open the door without pushing too hard.

I’ve had cases where a client’s description of recurring nightmares helped support a broader narrative in a mental health-related claim. Not as proof per se, but as part of a pattern that aligned with other clinical observations.

So yeah, while it can feel out of place if introduced too abruptly, I’ve found that when integrated thoughtfully, dream content can add depth to someone’s story—kind of like witness testimony that needs to be weighed, not taken at face value. Do you ever notice students referencing dreams in ways that surprise you? Like unexpected metaphors or emotional themes?
[A]: Absolutely, students often reference dreams in ways that surprise me—not because they’re unusual, but because of how raw and personal they feel. One student once described a dream where he was walking through a library, but every book he opened had blank pages. At first, he laughed it off as just weird, but then he said, “Maybe I’m scared that all the answers are missing, you know?” That metaphor struck me—it wasn’t about knowledge, but about uncertainty and anxiety around his research topic.

What’s interesting is how these dream references sometimes surface during transition periods: midterms, thesis writing, or even when they’re deciding on career paths. The dreams aren’t predictions or hidden messages, but they do mirror emotional states—like loneliness, ambition, or fear of failure—in ways that feel more honest than direct conversation.

I think part of why students bring them up is that dreams offer a kind of emotional distance—they can talk about something deeply personal without feeling exposed. It’s like saying, “This strange thing happened in my dream,” instead of, “I’m really struggling with self-doubt.”

Have you come across similar moments where a dream seemed to bypass the usual defenses and get straight to the emotional core? 📚
[B]: Completely. I’ve had clients describe dreams that, on the surface, seemed bizarre or random, but when unpacked, revealed a deep emotional resonance. One case that comes to mind was a surgeon who kept dreaming he was back in medical school but couldn’t remember any of the answers during exams. He was in his 50s, highly accomplished, yet those dreams coincided with a period of professional doubt—facing a major malpractice review.

At first, he shrugged it off as stress, but when we explored it further, he admitted feeling like an imposter again, like all his past confidence had been stripped away by one legal challenge. The dream wasn’t literal, of course, but it bypassed his usual rational defenses and tapped straight into that vulnerability.

I think what makes dreams so powerful in these moments is exactly what you said—they create a safe distance. People can explore difficult emotions without feeling exposed. It’s like using a metaphor to say, “This part of me is hurting,” without having to point directly at the wound.

Do you ever encourage students to revisit a dream later—say, after some time has passed or after they’ve worked through part of their struggle? I’m curious how, or if, the narratives shift over time.
[A]: I do sometimes suggest revisiting dreams, especially with students who are open to self-reflection. I usually frame it as a kind of personal narrative tracking—like keeping a journal entry for future reference. Some students find it helpful to look back and see how their inner landscape has shifted, even if the dreams don’t “resolve” in any clear way.

One student, for example, had a recurring dream about being stuck in a locked classroom during finals week. We talked about it during her second year, and she dismissed it as just stress. But when she brought it up again a year later—now saying the door had finally opened a little—it became a quiet but meaningful marker of her growing confidence.

It’s not always dramatic, but there’s often a subtle shift in tone or detail that mirrors what they’re experiencing consciously. Sometimes the same dream becomes less intense, or the symbols change slightly, which can be really telling.

I’ve found that the act of revisiting itself can be therapeutic—it gives them a sense of continuity and agency, like they’re not just stuck in the moment. Do you ever use that kind of temporal reflection in your sessions? It seems like it could add depth even in legal or clinical contexts. ✍️
[B]: Definitely. In fact, I often encourage clients to revisit not just dreams, but recurring thoughts or emotional reactions over time—it’s like building a timeline of inner experience. In legal cases involving mental health claims or trauma-related injuries, being able to identify patterns in how someone describes their internal world can be incredibly useful context, even if it's not admissible as hard evidence.

I had one client who initially described a dream of drowning in paperwork—endless forms, unreadable contracts. At the time, he was going through a messy medical dispute and feeling overwhelmed by bureaucracy. Months later, after some resolution had been reached, he mentioned the same dream but said he now had a life jacket on, though the water was still high. That subtle shift told me a lot about his evolving sense of agency—even if the external stressors hadn’t fully disappeared.

So yes, I absolutely see the value in what you're describing. It’s not about decoding a message like a puzzle, but more like tracking an emotional GPS 📍—helping people orient themselves within their own psychological terrain. It gives them—and us—a better map of where they’ve been, and where they might be headed.

I think what makes this approach powerful is that it respects the complexity of the human mind without forcing meaning where there isn’t any. Sometimes a dream doesn’t mean anything profound… and sometimes, it quietly says exactly what needs to be heard.
[A]: Exactly. It’s that balance between meaning-making and over-interpretation that I find most delicate—and important. Dreams, like emotions, don’t always come with instructions, but they do invite us to pay attention. Sometimes just acknowledging that a dream affected someone strongly is enough—no need to rush in with an explanation.

I’ve had students who came back weeks later and said something like, “You know that weird dream I told you about? I think I get why it bothered me now.” And often, the insight isn’t dramatic—it’s more like a small realignment of how they see themselves or their situation.

I like your metaphor of an emotional GPS 📍—because it implies movement, change, and the need for recalibration. In teaching and counseling, I think we’re often helping students navigate not just external challenges, but internal ones too. Dreams can be one of those quiet signals that something needs adjusting, even if they don’t tell us exactly what.

I wonder—do you ever notice clients returning to certain dreams years later, almost like old journals? Not for analysis, but for reflection? I’ve found that some people develop a kind of personal mythology around certain dreams, almost like touchstones in their life story.
[B]: Absolutely—I see that more than I’d expect, especially with clients who have gone through major life transitions. Some of them revisit old dreams the way you’d re-read a journal entry from a past version of yourself. One client, for example, had kept a short dream log during a particularly turbulent period in her medical treatment. Years later, she mentioned flipping through it and realizing how closely those dreams mirrored her emotional arc—fear, resistance, acceptance, resilience.

She didn’t try to analyze them like case law 📚, but more like personal artifacts—reminders of where she’d been and how far she’d come. It gave her a sense of continuity, almost like witnessing her own growth from a different angle.

I think what happens there is less about decoding meaning and more about reclaiming narrative ownership. Dreams, in that sense, become part of someone’s inner history—a chapter they can look back on with compassion for their former self.

It makes me wonder if students ever do something similar in academic or personal development contexts. Do any of your advisees ever circle back to older reflections or journals? Or maybe even re-dream variations of past dreams with new details that reflect where they are now?
[A]: I’ve definitely had students who circle back to old journals, sometimes by accident—like finding a notebook from their first year while cleaning out a drawer—and suddenly seeing it through new eyes. The reaction is often something like, “Wow, I was  worked up about that one paper,” or “I can’t believe I used to doubt whether I belonged here.”

Some of them revisit those pages almost nostalgically, like reading letters from an earlier version of themselves. And yes, a few have mentioned re-dreaming variations of past dreams, sometimes with subtle but meaningful shifts: the locked classroom becomes a hallway with an open door, or the endless staircase has landings now.

One student told me she used to dream about standing in front of the class without knowing her presentation, which made sense at the time—first-year anxiety, imposter syndrome. Years later, she said she still has versions of that dream, but now she’s speaking and people are listening, even asking thoughtful questions. She described it as “the same stage, but a different script.”

I think what you said about reclaiming narrative ownership is exactly right. It’s not just reflection—it’s taking back agency over how they see their own journey. Sometimes dreams help with that quietly, just by showing up again in a slightly altered form.

It reminds me of how we grow into our identities—not all at once, but through layers of experience, memory, and self-revision. 👍 Do you ever find clients revisiting dreams during moments of transition, like career changes or personal milestones? It seems like those junctures bring up a lot of looking backward to make sense of where you’re headed.
[B]: Absolutely, those transitional moments—career shifts, retirement, major life changes—often bring a natural inclination to look back and make sense of the path traveled. I’ve noticed clients revisiting old dreams during these times almost like reviewing a personal archive. Sometimes they’ll mention it unprompted:  they’ll say, often with a mix of surprise and curiosity.

One former client, a physician transitioning out of clinical practice into medical policy, recounted dreaming again of being in the operating room—but this time, instead of feeling pressure or urgency, he was observing quietly, almost as if he were a consultant rather than the lead surgeon. He found it strangely reassuring. It wasn’t a dramatic revelation, but more like an inner nod: 

These moments often come up when people are redefining their identity, especially when stepping away from something that once defined them. Dreams seem to echo that internal renegotiation.

So yes, I completely agree—they help us navigate not just where we’ve been, but how we’re adapting to where we’re going. And sometimes, they offer that quiet confirmation we didn’t know we needed. 🌿

Do you find students tend to revisit these dream narratives more during graduation periods, or maybe when considering post-grad plans? I imagine those can be pretty reflective times.
[A]: Definitely during graduation periods and when considering post-grad plans—those are prime times for reflection, uncertainty, and identity renegotiation. I’ve had students bring up old dreams in passing, almost as inside jokes with themselves:  or 

But more meaningfully, some revisit dream patterns when they’re weighing big decisions—like whether to go into industry or academia, or to take a break from studying. One student told me she’d started dreaming again about being lost on campus, even though she hadn’t felt that way in years. We talked through it, and she realized she was feeling unmoored by the thought of leaving the university structure. The dream didn’t give her the answer, but it did signal that something emotional was coming up—a kind of inner check-in.

I think what’s interesting is how dreams can surface before a person is fully aware of their own internal shift. Like a subconscious early warning system 🚸—not telling them what to do, but saying, 

It makes me wonder—do you ever see clients use dream narratives as part of their personal storytelling in legal or professional transitions? I imagine even in formal settings, people sometimes draw on those kinds of experiences when making sense of change. 👍
[B]: Absolutely, I do see that—more than you’d expect, even in what seem like the most formal or rigid settings. People naturally reach for stories to make sense of change, and dreams often slip into those narratives because they feel , yet oddly universal.

I remember one client—a senior researcher transitioning out of academia into a regulatory role—who casually mentioned having a dream about being back in her old lab, but now it had glass walls. She said she could see everything clearly, but didn’t feel the need to be  it anymore. It was such a quiet, poetic way of describing her emotional distance and clarity. We weren’t in therapy; this was part of a broader consultation on professional transition and ethics. But still, that dream became a touchstone in how she described her own evolution—from hands-on scientist to policy influencer.

In legal consultations too, especially those involving burnout, malpractice recovery, or career reconsideration, clients sometimes reference past dreams as metaphors for where they were versus where they are now. Not as evidence or argument, but as —a way to say, “This wasn’t just a job change; it shifted something deeper.”

So yes, even in rooms full of contracts and compliance forms, people still carry their inner landscapes with them. And every now and then, a dream slips into the conversation—not as an exhibit, but as an echo of the personal journey behind the professional move.

Do you ever encourage students to write those moments down formally—like integrating dream reflection into personal statements or transition journals? Or does it tend to stay more informal and conversational? 📝
