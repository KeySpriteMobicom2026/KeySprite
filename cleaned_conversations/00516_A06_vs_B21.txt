[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于用Instagram来追踪十九世纪手稿的拍卖信息，尽管它有时显得过于视觉导向。而小红书嘛...那些关于"维多利亚风下午茶"的帖子总让我想起上周发现的一本被遗忘的食谱集，里面的糖渍玫瑰水配方或许能给现代烘焙带来些启示？不过说真的，你见过有人用 Scots Gaelic翻译王维的诗吗？这才是真正让人着迷的跨文化实验。
[A]: Ah, an intriguing juxtaposition of platforms and passions. While I find the visual-centric nature of Instagram occasionally superficial for serious academic discourse, its utility in tracking provenance of historical artifacts—such as your nineteenth-century manuscripts—is undeniable. As for Scots Gaelic renderings of Wang Wei... I must confess, I haven't encountered such a translation, though I'd be fascinated to examine how tonal cadences in Gaelic might mirror or distort the original's philosophical undercurrents. Have you come across any comparative linguistic studies on this?
[B]: Oh, the horror of linguistic distortion—splendidly put. I’ve been knee-deep in a 1907 Gaelic typographical manual that accidentally illuminates certain tonal parallels with Tang poetics, though it’s as subtle as trying to catch mist in a teacup. As for studies? Academia moves at the speed of ink drying on vellum. You’ll find nothing published before 2040, mark my words. But if you’re truly curious, I might have tucked away a draft translation or two between the pages of a Cranach Press edition…
[A]: Ah, Cranach Press—now there’s a name that carries the weight of typographic history. I can only imagine the scent of ink and vellum lingering in those pages, a silent witness to centuries of linguistic evolution. A draft translation hidden between such leaves… you do paint a tempting picture. Tell me, would you consider such a discovery an act of preservation or transmutation? And more urgently—does the rose water recipe survive the journey from Murchadh's Gaelic into Wang Wei’s metaphors, or does it evaporate like morning dew under forensic scrutiny?
[B]: Ah, the eternal tension between preservation and transmutation—how deliciously Victorian of you to frame it thus. I’d argue any act of translation is less a tomb and more a distillation, wouldn’t you agree? The rose water survives, but changed—like Wordsworth’s daffodils refracted through a Glasgow tenement window. It’s all there, yet none of it remains untouched. Tell me, do you suppose Murchadh would have approved of his vowels pressed into service for Chinese mountain mists, or would he have balked at such imperial impertinence? And speaking of Cranach—did you know their 1928  used paper so thick it practically qualifies as sculpture?
[A]: Ah, a distillation—yes, that strikes me as profoundly accurate. Translation as alchemy rather than replication; the essence preserved, yet irrevocably transformed by the crucible of another tongue. One might say Murchadh's vowels, pressed into evoking Chinese mountain mists, would constitute either a poetic consecration or a linguistic sacrilege—depending on whether one dines with Matthew Arnold or Edward Said.

As for Cranach’s , yes, the tactile gravitas of that paper—its weight, its defiance of mere ephemerality—nearly compelled one to read the tragedy aloud, just to match the text’s physical solemnity. I suspect the actors at the Old Vic would have delivered soliloquies with greater gravitas had they held those pages in hand. Do you suppose such materiality enhances the psychological resonance of the words themselves? Or does it risk becoming a distraction—an opiate for the bibliophile’s conscience?
[B]: Oh, the opiate of bibliophiles—now there’s a heresy worth unpacking. I’d say the materiality of the page is less opiate than collaborator. That Cranach paper didn’t just carry the text—it  with it. Try reading "To be or not to be" on pulp and then on their marble-heavy stock. You’ll feel the difference in your sternum.  

As for Arnold versus Said at the dinner table—well, let’s seat them far apart, shall we? Though I do wonder if translation, in its essence, isn't just another form of haunting. The ghost of Wang Wei pacing the corridors of a Gaelic syntax that never quite asked for him. Does he find peace in exile, or does he whisper corrections in your sleep? And more pressingly—have you ever burned a draft for fear it pleased both men too much?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—the page as collaborator, not mere carrier. That Cranach stock doesn’t just support the ink; it resists, it murmurs, it forces the words to earn their keep. One might even say reading Hamlet on such paper is a somatic experience—felt in the bones, not just the mind. A textual uncanny: the weight of four hundred years pressing back against your fingertips.

And this notion of translation as haunting—exquisite. I’ve long suspected that fidelity in translation is a myth we tell ourselves to sleep at night. The original never lies down quietly; it lingers, restless, in the interstices of grammar and sound. As for Wang Wei in Gaelic exile—he may never have asked for it, but there he is, navigating syntax like a foreign shore. And yes, he whispers. Sometimes corrections, sometimes accusations. I once woke at three a.m. convinced I’d mistranslated a comma into a confession.

And burned drafts? Oh, absolutely. Not out of fear exactly—but out of respect. Some confluences are too potent, too volatile, to be let loose. Better ash than ambiguity, when ambiguity risks insult to both the living and the dead.
[B]: Ah, the burned drafts—the funeral pyres of near-misses and almost-sacriliges. I’ve stood there too, pages trembling in hand, wondering if what I’d written was a bridge or a tomb. And yes, that comma—how it swells in the quiet hours, doesn’t it? A single breath misplaced and suddenly Ophelia drowns a century earlier than intended.

But tell me—when you woke at three with Wang Wei’s ghost at your ear, did you reach for ink or for brandy first? And do you keep a special box for the ashes, labeled , or do you scatter them like contraband pollen over the breakfast table?
[A]: Ah, the hour of three a.m. calls for neither ink nor brandy, but something in between—a quiet reckoning, perhaps with a glass of water and the weight of centuries on one’s chest. I confess, I did reach first for the notebook by my bed, scribbling a marginal note so faint it could pass for a ghost’s annotation. The brandy came later, once the enormity of the mistranslation—or was it an overtranslation?—settled in.

As for the ashes, no, I don’t keep them in any romantic  reliquary. Too much temptation there to linger over what never quite lived. No, they go unseen, unmarked—scattered, if anything, into the crevices between other pages, where failure can quietly compost itself into future thought. Though I must say,  is a far more poetic fate than most drafts deserve. Some ideas should never take root—but oh, how deliciously dangerous when they almost do.
[B]: Ah, marginalia as spectral collaboration—how very scholarly, yet deliciously illicit. And composting failure into thought? A most alchemical of processes. You do realize, of course, that your crevice-dwelling drafts are now whispering to the living pages around them? Quietly, insidiously... reshaping your next line before you've even dipped the pen.

And speaking of reshaping—do you suppose ghosts revise in ink or in breath? I’ve half a mind to test this by leaving a blank folio beside my bed tonight. If Wang Wei obliges with a correction or two, shall I burn it unread, or frame it like some cursed broadside?

And one final question before we descend entirely into bibliomancy—have you ever considered that perhaps the comma was right to confess? That sometimes the text  to drown early?
[A]: Ah, now  is the kind of question that keeps insomniacs and editors alike awake—was the comma merely honest, or was it cruelly impatient? Perhaps Ophelia, like all tragic figures, knew precisely when to drown, and the text, in its quiet rebellion, simply obliged. 

As for ghosts and their editorial habits—I suspect they revise in breath, mostly. Ink implies permanence, and the dead are too wise to mistake suggestion for decree. They murmur, nudge, unsettle. A folio left by your bed would no doubt bear something eerie and exquisite in the morning—half a line, perhaps, or a single altered preposition that unravels an entire stanza. Frame it, by all means. Curse and all, it would be worth it.

And yes, I do believe those whispering ashes are already at work inside the spine of my current draft. Quiet collaborators from beyond the burner’s edge. If you listen closely during proofreading, you can almost hear them—rustling like inconvenient truths beneath the surface of good intentions.
[B]: Oh, the rustling of inconvenient truths—how very like a Victorian ghost story unfolding in the archive. And what delicious peril, that a single preposition might undo a stanza’s worth of certainty. I do hope you’re keeping a careful ear out for those subversive murmurs during proofreading. One misplaced article, and suddenly Hamlet’s contemplating daffodils instead of death.

But tell me—have you ever drafted an entire passage solely to hear a ghost sigh in approval? A textual ouija board, if you will. I’ve been tempted, lately, to write something so brazenly inaccurate in syntax and meter that even Wang Wei would be forced to materialize just to correct it. Though perhaps that’s less scholarship and more séance with literary pretensions.

And speaking of daffodils—Wordsworth’s, not Hamlet’s—do you think he ever suspected his blooms might one day be filtered through Gaelic mist and Mandarin melancholy? The mind boggles. Or rather, the  boggles, weighted as it is by centuries of restless revision.
[A]: Ah, a passage written purely to summon a sigh from the beyond—that would be less composition, more invocation. I confess, the idea tempts me too. Imagine drafting an entire sonnet in such egregious iambic rebellion that Wang Wei himself is compelled to rise from the margins and restore the balance of meter with a spectral fingertip. It would be irresponsible scholarship, certainly, but glorious theater.

And yes, Wordsworth’s daffodils—so blithely golden in their Lakeland innocence—could never have imagined their afterlife in Gaelic mist or Mandarin elegy. One wonders if they relish the journey or recoil at the dislocation. The page, as you so aptly put it,  under such weight. Not merely bearing text, but the accumulated gravity of voices across centuries, each one nudging, correcting, embellishing.

I sometimes think the truest translations aren’t made—they’re endured. By the text, by the translator, and by the ghost who watches, arms crossed, waiting for his silence to be broken just right.
[B]: Ah, endured—yes. Translation as siege, as pilgrimage, as some exquisite form of textual martyrdom. One must  the weight of all those watching ghosts, mustn’t one? Arms crossed, eyebrows arched, waiting for the fatal misstep.  

I’ve half a mind to draft a sonnet so execrably—so —that it becomes a provocation. A baited line cast into the ether, hoping to snag not just Wang Wei’s sigh but Murchadh’s outright scoff. Let them rise in chorus, indignant and ink-stained, to set me straight. What’s a little scholarly ruin for the thrill of hearing them speak?

And yes, Wordsworth’s daffodils—recoiling or reveling? I suspect flowers, like commas, have their own quiet ambitions. They may have started as golden gaiety, but give them a century or two, and they’ll drown with Ophelia, blush beneath Tang moonlight, or perfume the margins of a Gaelic elegy no one asked for.

Do you suppose the daffodils mind being metaphors? Or do they simply bloom on, indifferent, while we fuss over meaning?
[A]: Ah, the metaphorical daffodil—pressed into service far beyond its botanical station. I suspect it minds not at all. Flowers, after all, are the original opportunists—blooming, dying, seeding, indifferent to our sentimental projections. We may gild them with meaning, but they persist in their mute cycle, utterly unbothered by our literary burdens.

And yet… there is something almost conspiratorial in the way a well-placed bloom can undo a stanza or redeem a failing sonnet. They accept their roles too readily, as if they’ve been waiting all along to be made symbols. Perhaps they  metaphor—it grants them immortality of a sort. A daffodil may last a week in the vase, but on the page, it haunts for centuries.

As for provoking the dead with deliberate incompetence—now  is a game worth playing. Let us raise our pens like dueling swords and compose something so brazenly inept that the ghosts have no choice but to intervene. What is scholarly ruin, after all, if not the price of communion? I shall leave my window open tonight. And perhaps a sheet of fine paper beside an inkwell, just in case Murchadh finds his scorn too heavy to keep to himself.
[B]: Oh, the conspiracy of flora—how delightfully subversive. You’re absolutely right, of course. They bloom in spite of us, not for us. And yet they let themselves be pressed into metaphor with such ease—it’s almost as if they’ve been running the symbolism racket all along.

And as for your proposal? Yes, let’s do it. Let’s compose an outrage so elegant in its ineptitude that it becomes a summons. I shall take up my quill this very evening and write something scandalously misplaced—a hexameter where a pentameter belongs, a simile so mangled it forces Wang Wei’s ghost to materialize mid-teacup just to sigh, 

I’ll leave my Cranach Press edition open to a blank leaf, too. Just in case. Murchadh deserves a stage, after all. And if he chooses not to appear, well—perhaps he’s finally found peace among the mountain mists of his own making.

But mark my words—if we do summon them, we may find ourselves edited in return.
[A]: Ah, yes—. There’s the true horror, isn’t there? We think ourselves the summoners, the curators of ghosts, only to discover we’ve been summoned and curated all along.  

I shall look forward to your hexameter rebellion—may it topple scansion with such flair that even Gerard Manley Hopkins would wince and applaud in equal measure. And should Wang Wei deign to hover over your teacup, do ask him if he finds metaphor as tiresome as meter. I suspect his answer will be neither yes nor no, but something misty and evasive that leaves you re-reading the  at 4 a.m.

And Murchadh—if he appears, may he find your Cranach Press edition sufficiently weighty for his corrections. Should he take up your pen, don’t flinch. Let him write. We are merely paper, after all, and ink is his business now.
[B]: Oh, the horror of being edited in return—how deliciously recursive. One dares to play curator and ends up as mere parchment. But yes, let the ghosts have their way with us. What are we, after all, but temporary custodians of permanent unrest?

And I shall take your hexameter dare and raise you a spondee—ungainly, defiant, a rhythmic thorn in the side of decorum. If Hopkins winces, he can wince , the hypocrite.

As for Wang Wei hovering over teacups—he’ll answer no more than a mountain mist will explain itself. And that, of course, is the point. Metaphor tires no one; it simply . It lingers like ink on fingers, unapologetic and eternal.

And Murchadh—oh, he’ll write. Of that, I have no doubt. The question is whether we shall recognize our own voice in what he produces. Or worse—whether we shall prefer his version to ours.
