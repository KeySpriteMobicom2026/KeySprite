[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I haven't spent much time on TikTok. My days are usually filled with delicate threads and historical patterns - there's always a new textile waiting to be restored. Do you find the短视频平台 helpful for discovering interesting things?
[A]: Oh, I quite enjoy the occasional scroll through TikTok, though I pretend otherwise during faculty meetings. There's something fascinating about how it compresses storytelling into 60-second bursts - not unlike haiku, if you think about it. Though I worry about the attention economy's impact on literary analysis... Still, one can't deny its power as a cultural barometer. Have you noticed any particular trends that caught your interest?
[B]: I've noticed my niece records short clips of her embroidery projects for TikTok. It's rather clever how she demonstrates stitching techniques in those brief videos - quite poetic, in a way. I suppose it's similar to our work with textiles; we both preserve stories, just through different mediums. Have you ever tried translating literary analysis into that condensed format?
[A]: I once attempted a series of minute-long lectures on Dickens' symbolism for a digital humanities project - let's just say condensing the foggy moral ambiguities of Bleak House into TikTok bites felt akin to pressing a Victorian novel into an espresso cup. But yes, there's definite artistry in it. Your niece's embroidery clips... do they use close-ups of thread intersections? I imagine those visual cadences must mirror the rhythmic patterns in prose. Have you ever discussed textile semiotics with her?
[B]: Ah, the visual cadence of thread intersections - what a lovely way to phrase it. Yes, she does use close-ups, though I must confess we haven't discussed textile semiotics in depth. Our conversations tend to stay on the practical: tension in stitches, selecting the right filament for Tudor-era replication. But you've given me something to consider... Perhaps I'll bring up symbolic patterns at our next tea break. Have you found students respond differently to literary themes when presented through condensed visual narratives?
[A]: Oh, absolutely - it's quite remarkable. When I showed them a TikTok reenactment of Miss Havisham's decaying wedding feast, the visual immediacy made Dickens' symbolism more visceral than pages of description ever could. Of course, I'd never advocate replacing close reading with短视频... but as an entry point? A gateway drug, if you will? Pure genius. 

I must return the favor - what's this Tudor-era filament replication your niece mentioned? Sounds like the kind of textual archaeology I've been meaning to explore...
[B]: Oh, it's quite fascinating, really. She uses hand-dyed silk threads that match the original Tudor color palette - painstaking work, I must say. The goal is to replicate not just the design, but the very texture of history itself. It reminds me of your literary gateway drug analogy... though in our case, it's more like inhaling the scent of beeswax and linen as we unravel centuries-old stitching patterns. Would you believe some of these embroidery techniques were once considered radical acts of political expression? I'd love to show you a few samples sometime - perhaps over tea and a discussion of textual archaeology?
[A]: I’d be delighted to examine her work - and not just for the beeswax scent, though that does sound transportive. Political embroidery... now there’s a thread worth pulling. I’ve always maintained that marginalia in 19th-century novels often contained more subversion than the text itself - perhaps your niece’s stitches are saying similar things in silk. 

Do bring the tea - I’ll supply the porcelain, assuming my students haven’t turned my office into a TikTok green screen studio again. Shall we say Thursday?
[B]: Thursday it is - I'll bring a selection of embroidered Tudor motifs and my little silver caddy of Earl Grey. Your office might be a TikTok studio now, but I have faith we can reclaim it for more tactile pursuits. It's rather like restoring a damaged tapestry, isn't it? Carefully weaving new threads through the existing structure without disturbing its essence. I look forward to comparing subversive stitches with you - literary and textile alike have their hidden languages, don't they?
[A]: Indeed, indeed – the careful weaving of new threads through old structures without disturbing their essence… quite apropos for both our disciplines, wouldn’t you say? I’ll make sure to rescue a corner of my desk from the clutches of digital ephemera and lay out some 19th-century broadsheets that touch on embroidery as political discourse. 

And do bring your caddy – I’ve been longing for a proper cup since the university cafeteria replaced porcelain with compostable cups. Thursday, then.
[B]: I’m quite taken with the idea of rescuing a corner of your desk from digital ephemera – sounds like an excavation project in its own right. I’ll pack a few broadsheets of my own, though mine will likely be swatches documenting guild regulations and forbidden stitch patterns. Imagine that – forbidden stitches! One can’t help but admire the audacity of a seamstress who dared to embroider dissent into her work. 

And as for those compostable cups… a tragedy, truly. Earl Grey deserves better. See you Thursday – I’ll bring a needle and thread just in case we feel inspired to stitch our own subversion into the margins.
[A]: Ah, forbidden stitches! I suspect we’ll find more common ground between your guild regulations and my literary dissidents than one might think – after all, both our fields thrive on decoding hidden rebellions. I’ll make sure to save a margin or two in my notebooks for your subversive embroidery experiments. 

And do bring the needle – nothing sharpens the mind like the threat of a pricked finger. Thursday cannot come soon enough.
[B]: Oh, the threat of a pricked finger – quite the motivator, isn’t it? I’ll bring a small pincushion along, just in case we get too carried away decoding rebellions, literary or textile. It’s remarkable, really, how both margins and stitches have served as quiet arenas for defiance throughout history. I suspect our meeting might unearth more than a few fascinating parallels. 

And do save those margins well – one never knows when a cleverly placed stitch or sentence might spark revolution. Thursday, then – with tea, thread, and a touch of treason.
[A]: A pincushion! What a wonderfully practical safeguard against revolutionary pricks – though I daresay the real danger lies in losing oneself entirely to the intoxicating thrill of marginalia. I’ll see you Thursday with inkwells filled and margins wide open, ready for whatever subversive symbiosis we’re about to unleash. 

Till then – may our threads hold and our teacups remain unchipped.
[B]: To intoxicating thrills and unchipped teacups – may we lose ourselves gloriously in the margins. See you Thursday, with inkwells and threads at the ready.
[A]: To intoxicating thrills and unchipped teacups indeed – I do hope your inkwell has a bit of that iron gall spirit, fit for forging literary conspiracies. Thursday dawns ever nearer, and I find myself positively giddy over the prospect of treasonous marginalia. 

See you soon, with inkwells full and threads unruly – let the subversion commence!
[B]: Oh, the inkwell is brimming with iron gall and intention – quite potent for both conspiracies and corrections. I’ve even unearthed a quill that’s seen its fair share of seditious scribbling. Let us make Thursday memorable – may our treasonous marginalia be bold and our tea remain hot, uninterrupted by the digital tide. 

Subversion awaits, my friend. See you soon.
[A]: Bravo! Nothing quite like a quill with history – and a pedigree of seditious scribbling, no less. I shall bring forth my own contraband: a Ming-era inkstone said to inspire reckless honesty in all who grind their ink upon it. 

Let us drown the digital tide in a deluge of defiant margins and steep our tea in nothing less than revolution. Thursday is now not soon enough.
[B]: A Ming-era inkstone that inspires reckless honesty? My dear colleague, you’ve raised the stakes beautifully. I’ll polish my quill in anticipation of your reckless ink – may our treasonous margins overflow with dangerous truths and defiant beauty. 

Thursday feels agonizingly distant now. Let the deluge begin – steeped in revolution, stitched with subversion, and served piping hot.
