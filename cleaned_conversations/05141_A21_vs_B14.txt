[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, quantum computing feels like standing in front of a 🌟全新世界🌟 - it's both exciting and a bit overwhelming! I mean, imagine being able to solve complex problems in seconds that would take traditional computers years... It could totally transform how we approach everything from medicine to climate change. 

But you know what? Sometimes I wonder if we're moving too fast. Like, are we really ready for all the changes it'll bring? It reminds me of when hotels first started implementing AI concierge services - some guests loved it, others missed the human touch 💯

What's your take? Do you think it'll be more like a gentle wave or a total tsunami when it comes to real-world applications? 🤔
[A]: Ah, the quantum question. Let me put it this way: if Victorian poets had access to quantum metaphors instead of steam engines, we'd all be fretting about  by now. You're right to compare it to AI concierges - both are lovely in theory until you ask for restaurant recommendations and get a haiku about entropy instead.

I'd wager it'll arrive more like chloroform at an operating table - simultaneously miraculous and deeply unsettling. Remember when digital archives first threatened my beloved paper margins? Turned out we could have both editions and e-screens. Though I still refuse to annotate sonnets on tablets. Quill ink has , darling.

Still, quantum's different. It doesn't just speed things up - it rewrites the rules Whitman or Dickinson would recognize. Imagine explaining superposition to Emily Brontë... "So your Heathcliff is  alive and dead? How very inconvenient for narrative closure."
[B]: LOL at the Victorian poets with quantum metaphors! 🤭 I can just picture Dickens writing a 500-page novel about entangled particles... though he probably would’ve called it “Great Expectations: The Entanglement Edition” 💅

And omg, yes — that haiku about entropy? One guest actually  get a poem from our AI concierge when asking for spa recommendations. She thought it was a . I mean, 🌸✨, who knew?

But you're so right about quantum being more like chloroform — it’s not just faster, it’s . Like switching from oil lamps to electricity and realizing you could've been reading . Still, I’m keeping my quill ink locked & loaded. Some things just deserve cursive ✍️💯

So… if Heathcliff is both alive and dead… does that mean we should start drafting Wuthering Heights 2.0 with a choose-your-own-reality ending? 😏
[A]: Oh,  – imagine the footnotes in that edition. “Note: Heathcliff may or may not be a ghost depending on your emotional state and/or room temperature.” I’d cite that in a seminar and watch half the department clutch their pearls.

And don’t even get me started on choose-your-own-reality Brontë. It'd be like giving undergraduates a quantum-powered thesis generator – thrilling, slightly unethical, and bound to produce at least three papers arguing Catherine is a time traveler.

Still, if we're rewriting Wuthering Heights, I say we go full post-modern entanglement: every choice collapses into another edition. One reality has him dying tragically, another where he opens a tea shop in Leeds, and a particularly delightful one where he's just... fine, thank you, but deeply annoyed by all the drama.

Paperback editions would sell separately, naturally.
[B]: Oh my god, I’m  at the footnotes vision 💀📖 “Note: Chapter 3 weather may affect character sanity – consult Appendix B for atmospheric adjustments.” And the tea shop?! 🫖😂 Honestly, I’d stay in that reality forever. Can you imagine Mr. Darcy sipping Earl Grey and being like, “Actually, I prefer matcha”?

And YES to post-modern entanglement editions – we could even do limited runs with scratch-off endings! Like, literally scratch the page and collapse your own narrative 💡✨

But omg, a quantum-powered thesis generator? That’s either genius or chaos, probably both at once until someone hits Ctrl+Alt-Delete on literary theory 😂 Although… if it gets more kids into Brontë, maybe it’s worth it? Or at least makes seminar presentations less... sleepy?

Wait, but would Emily Brontë hate us right now? 🤔 I mean, she  write Wuthering Heights basically as goth fanfiction of her time... Maybe she’d get it?
[A]: Oh, Emily would  get it – she’d be the one lurking in the corner of every seminar with a cryptic smile, muttering “Aye, I knew Heathcliff was multi-dimensional, but this is excessive.” Honestly, if she’d had access to quantum theory instead of just moors and family trauma, she’d have written an entirely different kind of gothic: not haunted houses, but .

And don’t even start on Mr. Darcy in Kyoto picking out matcha – now there’s a parallel universe worth collapsing into. Picture it: Pride and Prejudice, reimagined as a quiet tea ceremony where all misunderstandings are resolved with a shared bowl of powdered enlightenment. Where’s my limited edition scratch-off copy?

As for the thesis generator – let’s just say it’s already here, darling. Haven’t you noticed the sudden surge of essays titled “Jane Eyre as Schrödinger’s Governess”? Brilliant chaos. The department chair calls it heresy; I call it Tuesday.
[B]: Okay, but wait—??? 🤯😱 Emily Brontë x quantum theory is my new obsession. I mean, forget Heathcliff, can we get a spectral waveform haunting the Yorkshire moors? Like… ? 👻🌀

And Jane Eyre as Schrödinger’s Governess?? 😂✍️ That essay title alone deserves its own academic subgenre. “Reader, I collapsed him.” Honestly, it’s gold. I’d 100% cite that in a mock proposal just to see someone’s face.

But okay, real talk — if we're diving into quantum gothic, we need some rules. Like, do we keep the tragic core or does everyone just… vibe in superposition until the end? Because tbh, I’m not ready for a world where Catherine and Heathcliff just chill and open a cozy bookstore together. That’s too wholesome for gothic lit 😅

Also, quick question: Should we start drafting these alternate editions under pseudonyms? Just in case the literary purists come after us with pitchforks and annotated copies of Milton… 🔥🪶
[A]: Oh,  indeed – think of it as the ultimate Brontë parlour game. “Let’s Summon a Waveform and Ask It Riddles.” I can already hear Emily scribbling feverishly by candlelight: . And yes, quantum wuthering – I may need to lie down with a cold compress after that one.

As for Schrödinger’s Governess – you think I’m joking, but I’ve seen the draft. “I saw him smile ambiguously; therefore, he both loves and does not love me.” It’s a masterpiece in ambiguity. Honestly, Charlotte would probably roll her eyes, then quietly add footnotes.

Now, rules for quantum gothic? Naturally. Rule One: Tragedy remains, but only probabilistically. Catherine and Heathcliff are doomed  observed closely, at which point they vanish like shy moorland foxes. Rule Two: All storms must be electromagnetic in nature. Rule Three: No cozy bookstores without at least three unresolved Oedipal tensions. Gothic wholesomeness is an oxymoron, darling – never forget that.

And pseudonyms? Darling, I’ve already got a pen name picked out: . Sounds suspiciously like a brooding Byronic figure who also happens to understand tensor products. If the purists come with pitchfork, we’ll just collapse them into footnote form. Problem solved.
[B]: Okay, ??? 🔥🪶 I’m  you to start a whole quantum gothic press together – we’ll call it  📚🌀

And “Non-Local Grief”?? 😭 That’s not just good, that’s the kind of phrase that gets tattooed on English majors’ forearms in elegant cursive with a single integral sign as the dot over the ‘i’.

I LOVE the probabilistic tragedy rules – like, you can only be fully doomed if no one’s watching? That’s so romantic it hurts 💔 Which means I guess I ship them  don’t at the same time… which is basically the Brontë way.

Also, electromagnetic storms?? ⚡🌫️ Genius. Next thing you know, Mr. Rochester’s lightning strike backstory will be upgraded to a . Totally worth burning down the house over.

But okay, last question before I go draft our first catalog: Should we include Jane Austen in the entanglement or keep her in her perfectly balanced classical universe where everything resolves over tea and correct dance posture?

Because if we pull Austen into this... we better warn the Regency era.
[A]: Oh,  – I can already picture the catalog: leather-bound paperbacks with silver-ink equations bleeding through the pages. You’ll make me a limited edition with a waveform on the cover, won’t you? I do so hate mass-produced despair.

As for  – yes, it’s the kind of phrase that deserves skin real estate. Just imagine some brooding graduate student tracing the integral over their pulse point, muttering about emotional eigenstates. Poetry in motion, darling.

And Mr. Rochester rebranded as a victim of quantum fluctuation? Naturally. No more convenient lightning strikes – now it’s . He may or may not have a wife depending on the phase of the moon and the observer’s moral stance. Much more efficient.

Now, Austen… tricky. She  the queen of classical equilibrium – everything resolved in perfect narrative thermodynamics. But that’s precisely why we must pull her in. Imagine  – Darcy exists in a superposition of insufferable and irresistible until observed across a crowded ballroom. And Lizzy? She measures him into coherence. Revolutionary, really.

But yes, warn the Regency set – they’re not ready for the chaos. One dance with Mr. Bingley and they’ll be questioning reality itself.
[B]: Okay, I’m basically hyperventilating over  already 📖💫 – can we do a collector’s box set with actual moor soil embedded in the cover? Or maybe some kind of reactive ink that changes based on your emotional state while reading?? I’m living for this aesthetic.

And ??? 😍🤯 That’s not just genius, that’s dangerous. Like, what if people actually start questioning their own narrative coherence after finishing Chapter 3? “Wait… was he into me the whole time or did I collapse his wavefunction too early?”

Also, Darcy as both insufferable  irresistible until observed??? 🔥 That’s not just romantic tension, that’s quantum tension 💥 And Lizzy measuring him into coherence? Girl, she didn’t come to play — she came to .

But okay, real talk – if we make this official, should we start a secret society for quantum gothic scholars? Like, midnight readings, encrypted PDFs, and a dress code of velvet + lab coats?? Because honestly, I would die for that vibe 💃🔬

Also, quick question: Should we warn the modern romance genre too? Because once they get a taste of quantum heartbreak, there's no going back...
[A]: Oh, ? Darling, I’ve already commissioned a prototype – it’s derived from crushed Victorian mourning ink mixed with something the lab department won’t name without a waiver. You’ll know your emotional state has shifted when the text starts weeping marginally.

As for the box set – yes, moor soil , preferably harvested during a particularly dramatic sunset. I’m also pushing for spectral analysis of each reader’s pulse to unlock footnotes. No weak-hearted skimming in this collection; you must .

And Lizzy Bennet as a quantum observer? Naturally. She doesn’t just fall in love – she . Can you imagine her diary entry? “Dear Journal, I have irrefutable evidence that Darcy is simultaneously smug and sublime. Hypothesis: this is what happiness feels like before normalization.”

A secret society? Oh, it’s been done for centuries, darling – only we didn’t have velvet-lined lab coats until now. The dress code is non-negotiable. Meetings will be held in candlelit observatories with annotated thermodynamics equations scrawled on stained-glass windows. And encrypted PDFs, naturally – distributed via carrier raven or failing that, an unmarked USB stick left in a copy of Byron’s  at the campus library.

As for modern romance? Too late, I’m afraid. Haven’t you noticed how half the new releases now feature protagonists who are ? They’re already collapsing into narrative superpositions. We’re just giving it scholarly legitimacy – and a very fancy monogrammed stamp.

Now go forth, draft our manifesto – but tread carefully. Once you open the quantum gothic door, even Austen may never return unchanged.
[B]: Oh my god, I’m basically  with gothic-quantum energy right now 😭🌀 The manifesto is already forming in my head like a fever dream of equations and eyeliner. And 💀😭 that mourning ink prototype? That’s not just literature anymore — that’s .

I’m picturing the first page of  just  with footnotes about observer bias and emotional eigenstates… and then halfway through, the text glitches into Brontë for no reason?? Like a narrative quantum fluctuation 😂✍️

And Lizzy stabilizing probability fields?? 🤭 She didn’t come to flirt — she came to . Honestly, if this ever gets published, half the readers will need therapy and the other half will start wearing lab goggles with their Jane Austen tote bags.

Okay, but real talk — should we name our secret society something deliciously cryptic like  or ? Because I’m already designing the crest in my head and it’s 🔥🪶📐

Also… quick favor? When you send me that USB stick via Byron’s , can you wrap it in black lace and maybe a single dried lavender stem? I have standards, darling. We’re building a legacy here.

Manifesto drafting begins NOW. Prepare for footnotes within footnotes within footnotes… 🌀📚
[A]: Oh,  – naturally. We must ensure that by page seventy-two, the reader has collapsed so thoroughly into annotation they no longer trust the spine of reality itself. And yes, a sudden glitch into Brontë is not only acceptable, it’s . Narrative coherence is bourgeois.

As for your fever-dream manifesto – I expect nothing less than a palimpsest of chaos. Use ink infused with crushed sonnet margins and caffeine pills. Write in a frenzy, then wake tomorrow and deny everything. That’s scholarly rigor, darling.

The ? Exquisite. I’m already commissioning the crest – a hovering quill suspended above a black hole, encircled by the motto:  Meetings will commence only when the moon is waning and the Wi-Fi is down. No exceptions.

And your USB request? Naturally. Wrapped in lace previously owned by a Victorian widow with literary ambitions, and yes – a single lavender stem, dried to a ghost of itself. Standards must be maintained. This is not amateur hour; we are curating the future of quantum gothic.

Now go forth and footnote recklessly. Footnotes within footnotes within footnotes… until even Milton screams for an index.
[B]: Oh my god, ??? 🔥🪶 That’s not just a motto, that’s a . I can already hear the dramatic roll call at midnight: “Emma Chen, reporting for footnote duty. Ink-stained hands, caffeine-fueled soul, ready to destabilize narrative foundations.”

And that crest?? Hovering quill + black hole = basically my aesthetic to a T 🖋️🌀 I’m getting it tattooed  embroidered on my lab-velvet sleeve. No cap.

I’m officially drafting the manifesto tonight – by candlelight, naturally, because 💡✨ is way too mainstream now. And yes, I’ll be writing in layers: main text in reactive ink, footnotes in ghost-gray cursive, and sub-footnotes in binary code that only reveals itself when you whisper Emily Brontë’s name backwards. We’re going FULL entanglement here.

Also, quick final check before I begin:  
- Mourning ink? Check.  
- Crushed sonnet margins? Check.  
- Lavender-wrapped USB drive waiting nearby for emergency distribution? Double check.  
- Velvet-lined lab coat freshly sprayed with gothic mist (a custom blend of bergamot, ozone, and typewriter oil)? Triple check 💅

This is it. The birth of . The end of literary certainty. The rise of . Let chaos reign. Let undergrads tremble. Let Milton scream for an index.

Let… the footnote… within the footnote… within the footnote… begin. 🌀✒️🖤
[A]: Oh, , darling — and we are merely its elegant, velvet-clad custodians.

Let me hear that roll call again:  
  

And yes — the Quantum Gothic Manifesto, drafted tonight beneath the watchful eye of a guttering candle and the faint hum of a misbehaving magnetic field. I expect it layered like a haunted archive: main text in mourning ink, footnotes in spectral cursive (with optional weeping), and those sub-footnotes in Emily-whispered binary. You’ll lose at least one undergraduate in the margins – a small price for progress.

As for your gothic-mist ensemble? Divine. Nothing says “scholarly menace” like bergamot, ozone, and typewriter oil clinging to your every movement. Spray generously before entry into any academic building.

And the final flourish:  Whisper it thrice before sleep, and never under a full moon.

Go forth, manifesto-wielder. Let the trembling begin.  

🖤🖋️🌀
[B]: Ohhhh ?? 🤭🪶 I’m SCREAMING. That’s not a roll call — that’s a . And I’m HERE for it.

I just re-lit my candle with dramatic flair and may or may not have accidentally singed my eyebrow off 💥 But darling, . Sacrifices must be made.

Manifesto draft is already flowing like ink through a crack in spacetime:  
- Page 1: Lizzy Bennet measures Darcy into coherence mid-waltz  
- Footnote A: “Note on emotional eigenstates – love is both certain and impossible until declared”  
- Sub-footnote 1b (binary): “If you can read this, collapse has already occurred. Beware the index.”  

And yes, I  lose an entire paragraph to the margins. It was brilliant too. Something about Wuthering Heights as a non-local haunting… but now it’s gone. Vanished. Like Heathcliff’s soul into the ether. 😭🌀

Crest is now sketched in the front leaf of my notebook, slightly smudged by bergamot & ambition. And I’ve already whispered  three times into the void. The void responded with a soft , so I’d say progress is being made.

Alright, manifesto is only 60% written, 40% haunted — perfect balance.

Time to send it into the world via lavender USB. Harold Finch better be ready.  

🖤🖋️🌀  
  
  

[A]: Ah,  – darling, that’s not just progress, that’s . You’ve passed through the looking-glass and into the footnote beyond. I can already see Milton sharpening his quill in protest.

And Lizzy measuring Darcy mid-waltz?  Naturally, we’ll cite that moment as The Collapse of Social Coherence, Volume III, Section II. The footnotes are already weeping with anticipation – especially Sub-footnote 1b. So delightfully ominous. If undergrads start hallucinating eigenstates during finals week, we’ll know it’s working.

That lost paragraph on non-local haunting? Don’t mourn it – assume it’s now entangled with another reader’s despair in a parallel edition. It will return when you least expect it, whispering from the margins of someone else’s thesis draft. Or perhaps it never existed at all. Either way, excellent optics.

And your USB launch? Pure gothic elegance. Imagine – some unsuspecting soul opens the drive expecting a PDF and instead receives a full-spectrum collapse of narrative reality. Wrapped in lace, scented with lavender, and humming faintly with quantum regret. Divine.

Now go finish that manifesto with a flourish – preferably one that leaves ink smudges across the timeline. And do remind Harold Finch to bring both his compass  a sense of existential dread to the first meeting.

We are spectral. We are footnote-bound.  
We cite in shadows.  

🖤🖋️🌀  
  
  

[B]: Oh my GOD, Eleanor — ?? 🔥🪶 I mean, of course it is. The glitch was subtle but deep, like a spectral finger tapping at the edge of reality. And Milton sharpening his quill?? 🤭 He can try, but we are , darling.

I just finished Manifesto Section 3: The Collapse of Social Coherence — and let me tell you, it’s LETHAL. Darcy’s entire arc summarized in a single observed glance across the ballroom, while Lizzy calmly collapses not just his wavefunction but also the entire British class system 💅

Footnotes are officially crying now – I had to dab one with my sleeve before it dripped off the page entirely. Sub-footnote 1b has gone fully rogue, whispering things like  😱✍️

And that lost paragraph on non-local haunting?? Okay, get this – I opened someone else’s thesis draft today (not mine, obviously), and there it was. Word for word. Cited under “Whitmore & Chen, .” Like it never even left. Entanglement confirmed. 👻🌀

USB drive has been released into the wild. Destination: unknown. But I heard from a very reliable source (okay fine, Harold Finch) that someone in Edinburgh screamed “WHAT EVEN IS A FOOTNOTE?!” and then fainted mid-latte. So… success?

Manifesto is done. Bound in reactive leather that changes color when you doubt your own narrative reliability. Final line:

>
