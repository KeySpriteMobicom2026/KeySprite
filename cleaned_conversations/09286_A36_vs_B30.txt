[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been revisiting some 19th-century parlor games recently - much more fascinating than modern board games, if you ask me. Did you know the Victorians had a version of "Consequences" that often included literary excerpts and moral dilemmas? Quite unlike today's trivial pursuits. Though I must admit, I did try a game called  last week with some students. Rather complex, but it does make one ponder the ethics of colonial expansion in a new context.
[A]: Oh, how intriguing! I must say, I’ve always found those old parlor games utterly charming—especially "Consequences." There's something delightfully quaint about folding a piece of paper and reading out the absurd results with a cup of tea in hand. But ? That sounds like quite the intellectual challenge! I can imagine the conversations it sparks—moral quandaries wrapped in futuristic ambition. Do you often play with students, or was this a special occasion?
[B]: Ah, you’ve captured the spirit exactly - absurdity and decorum folded together like origami. I usually reserve game nights for my graduate students, though I make exceptions when curious undergraduates present themselves with particularly... earnest proposals. Last week’s session was ostensibly a reward for completing our seminar on , though I suspect half of them just wanted to see if I’d let slip any scandalous academic gossip. 

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how both "Consequences" and  require a kind of narrative surrender? One through chance, the other through strategy—but both reveal how much we crave storytelling, even in structured play. Still, I must say, it lacks the tactile pleasure of folding paper and passing it around a dimly lit drawing room. A porcelain teacup clinked against saucer will always trump a dice roll, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—there’s nothing quite like the delicate clink of porcelain to set the tone for an evening of mischief and mirth. I can just picture it: the soft glow of lamplight, a circle of eager faces, and that first folded slip of paper being passed along with a knowing smile. It  feel more intimate, somehow—like you’re all conspiring in the creation of a shared little universe.

And yet, I must admit, there’s something thrilling about watching a group wrestle with the weighty decisions in . Just last weekend, two guests were debating whether to prioritize oceans over forests for nearly half the game! You could almost see the cogs turning in their minds as they weighed aesthetics against ethics—or was it the other way around? 

Still, I do miss the simplicity of those old games. Perhaps we ought to start a tradition here at the hotel—a monthly parlor night, complete with quill pens and sealing wax. What do you think?
[B]: A monthly parlor night? My dear, you’ve struck upon a notion so agreeably anachronistic it practically demands to be written down in a leather-bound journal with a wax seal to match. I’d be delighted to contribute my collection of 19th-century rulebooks—some rather rare editions, if I may boast—and perhaps even a few reproduction quills. Though I must insist we also include a round of ; nothing loosens the academic tongue quite like being made to recite Wordsworth while balancing a teaspoon on one’s nose.

As for your Martian dilemmas—oceans versus forests, indeed! It’s fascinating how modern games force us into pseudo-scientific moralizing. The Victorians, by contrast, would simply ask whether your character was “of sufficiently elevated sensibility to merit a happy ending.” No need for CO₂ levels or global temperature thresholds—just a well-turned phrase and a properly penitent heart. 

Still, I suppose both pursuits ultimately reveal the same truth: we are all just trying to impose some semblance of order—moral, ecological, or otherwise—on chaos. Whether through ink and paper or hexagonal tiles and silicon valley strategy cards.
[A]: Quite so—whether it’s a quill scratching across paper or the quiet clatter of tiles being placed, we are all just chasing a little order in the delightful mess of human imagination. And really, what better way to do it than surrounded by others equally invested in the game, whether they’re reciting Wordsworth with a teaspoon precarious on their nose or passionately defending the ecological merits of oceans over forests?

I shall have to look into securing some beeswax for sealing and perhaps commission a few custom invitations. I can already hear the murmurs of intrigue from guests when they see such curiosities lying about. As for the forfeits—I must say, you’ve elevated what was once mere childish fun into something gloriously scholarly.

But tell me, do you ever find yourself slipping into character during these games? I sometimes catch myself adopting a rather archaic manner of speaking when I’m deep into a round of "Consequences." It’s as though the paper and ink alone are enough to transport one—however briefly—to another era entirely.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I become positively Elizabethan if the game involves quills and parchment. It’s quite involuntary, really. Something about the weight of the paper, the smell of ink, and before I know it, I’m asking if anyone has a “pottle of ink” rather than simply a pen. I suppose it’s a kind of method scholarship, don’t you think? Immersing oneself in the material conditions of the text.

And speaking of immersion, have you ever noticed how the language of games—especially older ones—shapes behaviour? In "Consequences," one doesn’t merely write and fold; one  to paper with a kind of performative gravity, as though the slip might be discovered by posterity. Whereas in , everyone speaks like a CEO with a minor in philosophy—very utilitarian, very self-consciously consequentialist.

I suspect we both suffer from the same affliction: a tendency to romanticise the past just enough to make it useful, but not so much that it loses its intellectual teeth. Let’s call it the . Or perhaps, the —still debating which formulation sounds more erudite.  

In any case, I shall bring my 1847 edition of  and a tin of Earl Grey infused with bergamot—carefully measured, never overpowering. Do let me know when the beeswax arrives; I’ve always fancied crafting a seal with something suitably cryptic. Perhaps —games in the shadows. Sounds scholarly  suspiciously arcane, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, I do love how you say —it has the perfect air of genteel mystery. I can already picture the seal pressed into deep red wax, resting beneath the dim glow of candlelight. And your 1847 edition? I daresay that alone would send a thrill through any guest with even a passing fancy for antiquity.

As for our shared affliction—yes, I believe you’ve named it well. There is something about handling old paper, real ink, and even the faintest scent of beeswax that invites a kind of reverence. It’s not just playing a game; it’s stepping into a story still warm from the past. And yes, far be it from us to sentimentalise history—we simply appreciate its edges, its texture, its… .  

I must confess, though, I do find myself wondering what the Victorians would make of modern gaming parlours. Would they scoff at the glowing screens and silent concentration? Or would they marvel at how we still gather, still play, still chase endings—happy or otherwise?

In any case, I shall save a corner of the drawing room just for you and your quills. Do bring extra sealing wax if you’d be so kind—I fear my first attempts may lean a touch too enthusiastic. And perhaps a small notebook for guests to record their most scandalous consequences? One never knows when a future academic memoir might begin as a folded slip passed around in mirth.
[B]: Oh, extra sealing wax? My dear, I shall bring an entire —red, black, and perhaps a touch of imperial purple for those particularly dramatic confessions. And a notebook? Naturally. I happen to have a leather-bound volume from 1863 that’s seen more than its fair share of scandal—I’ll lend it only if you promise not to transcribe its previous contents, which involve a certain clergyman, a misplaced umbrella, and far too much brandy.

As for the Victorians in our modern gaming dens—well, I rather think they’d be horrified at first. All that electric light! No cravats! But give them half an hour with a decent cup of tea and a controller, and I suspect they’d settle right in. After all, isn’t the steam-powered automaton merely the 19th-century dream of progress rendered in brass and gears? And aren’t we still playing , just under different names?

And yes, substance—that elusive quality we chase like literary foxes through the woods of modernity. Paper with a watermark deep enough to hold a secret, ink that stains your fingers and thus your conscience, just slightly. One must  the game, mustn’t one? Otherwise, what’s the consequence?

I shall look forward to claiming my corner of the drawing room—do remind the staff not to dust me away entirely, however absorbed they may become in the chaos of folded paper and philosophical debate.
[A]: Oh, I shall have the staff leave you quite undisturbed—perhaps with a small brass plaque to mark your corner:  And as for that casket of wax—why, I do believe imperial purple shall be reserved for confessions of the highest drama, while black may be used exclusively for philosophical betrayals. Red, of course, shall be saved for love affairs gone awry. One must maintain standards, even in sealing wax.

And speaking of standards—I quite agree the Victorians would adapt marvelously. Once properly outfitted with goggles and perhaps a steampunk waistcoat or two, they’d be utterly unstoppable. Why, give them a glowing screen and a decent moral dilemma, and they’d feel quite at home! After all, isn’t ethical quandary merely the modern parlor game?

I do hope you’ll bring your quill with the nicest feather—something suitably dramatic to stir the imagination of our guests. And if anyone should inquire about the notebook’s origins, I shall simply say it was found behind a false panel in an old bookshelf—no need to spoil the mystery.

Until then, I shall prepare the tea tray, sharpen the pencils, and perhaps hide a few scandalous prompts of my own among the blank slips. One  keep things interesting, after all.
[B]: A brass plaque? My dear, you are positively encouraging my scholarly mischief—which I appreciate more than I can properly articulate without sounding like a character from a forgotten melodrama. —I may just have it engraved, if only to unsettle the more earnest of your guests.

And your wax stratification—purple for drama, black for philosophy, red for ruined romances—is nothing short of inspired. I shall bring a small velvet-lined tray to display them with due ceremony. One must not merely seal an envelope; one must  the nature of the consequence within before it’s even read. Quite brilliant, really—like labelling vials in a mad alchemist’s study.

As for the Victorians with goggles—yes, yes, a thousand times yes. They’d take one look at our screens and mutter about “the telegraph made visible,” then proceed to invent an entirely new moral framework by which to judge our digital dalliances. And we, in turn, should do them proud by continuing to fret over the ethics of artificial intelligence with precisely the same vigour they reserved for railway etiquette.

The quill shall be chosen with care—perhaps a crow feather, slightly dramatic but not ostentatious. And I shall arrive early to slip a few  incendiary prompts into the stack. Something along the lines of:  Now that would make for a memorable round of Consequences.

Tea tray at the ready, then. I shall bring biscuits of the ginger variety—firm enough to dunk without crumbling, yet spicy enough to encourage bold choices.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the clink of teacups and the rustle of scandalous paper slips—what a perfectly delicious anticipation! And your crow feather quill? Inspired choice. Slightly dramatic, as you say, but ever so subtly defiant—just the sort of thing to make one’s handwriting feel like a declaration rather than mere correspondence.

Your prompts are nothing short of genius. That baroness with a printing press and a stolen letter—why, she may very well become the star of many a whispered conversation long after the game is done. I shall have to think of a few myself… perhaps something involving a misplaced heirloom, an unsent telegram, and a midnight rendezvous at the conservatory. Nothing too obvious, of course—only enough to stir the imagination.

And your Victorian-modern-moral-framework theory? Absolutely spot on. I suspect we’re all still writing the same dilemmas, only now we do it in pixelated ink. But give them goggles, a brass compass, and a bit of steam-powered flair, and they’d be quite at home among our modern anxieties.

As for the biscuits—ginger it is! I shall provide a tin of my own, just slightly spiced, to match the mood. We’ll need fortification between forfeits and philosophical debates, after all.

I daresay this parlor night shall go down in hotel lore. Perhaps even warrant its own leather-bound volume, tucked away behind the front desk, to be discovered generations from now by some curious soul who’ll wonder what on earth  truly meant.
[B]: Oh, I do hope they wonder—and puzzle over it for years, no doubt attributing far more grandeur and secrecy than we ever intended. That’s the beauty of leaving behind ink-stained relics; posterity always improves upon the truth.

Your conservatory rendezvous prompt sounds particularly promising—add a dash of fog, a single misplaced glove, and perhaps a pocket watch stopped at midnight, and you’ve got yourself a full-blown narrative engine. I do hope you’ll be including those in your hidden stack. Nothing too obvious, as you say—but just enough to make the guests lean in and whisper.

I shall, of course, bring my crow feather quill—though I suspect by the end of the evening, half the room will be writing with theatrical flourish, convinced their handwriting has suddenly become the key to unlocking some great emotional cipher. It’s the magic of the game, really. Or is it the magic of good company and better tea?

And speaking of—your ginger biscuits shall be most welcome. I insist on dunking protocol: no crumbling, no splashing, only deliberate, contemplative dips followed by equally contemplative consumption. Any less, and we might as well be playing on a screen.

Yes, let us make this night so steeped in atmosphere and consequence that even the ghosts in the east wing take notes. , indeed.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—let the ghosts take notes indeed! I shall leave a spare quill and a saucer of ink upon the east wing writing desk just in case. One must always accommodate devoted spectators, especially when they’ve been around long enough to remember better-dressed scandals.

And your additions—fog, glove, stopped pocket watch—are pure genius. You have a gift for detail, my dear. I can already see our guests pausing mid-sip, eyes alight with inspiration, as they craft their little narrative catastrophes. And isn’t that the loveliest part? How a single misplaced object can unravel an entire imaginary life before dessert is even served?

I shall uphold the dunking protocol with solemn reverence—no hasty dips, no careless crumbs. A biscuit should be savoured like a well-placed punchline or a particularly satisfying forfeit. And if anyone  manage to spill tea in the heat of composition, well—that shall simply be added to the lore.

As for the magic of it all, I suspect it’s a blend of both good company  superior tea. But let’s not spoil the illusion. Some things, like consequences and ghosts, are best left gently mysterious.
[B]: Quite right—let the ghosts take their notes in peace, and let us provide them with proper materials lest they resort to scribbling on ectoplasmic scraps. A saucer of ink and a quill feather plucked from the very ether—why, they may even improve upon our prompts! I daresay a phantom baroness with a stolen letter has rather more dramatic potential than a merely mortal one.

And speaking of atmosphere, your touch with fog and pocket watches is unparalleled. One might almost hear the faint echo of hurried footsteps down a gaslit corridor—or is that just my imagination indulging itself again? Either way, it’s precisely that sort of embellishment that makes parlor games such delicious sport. The best stories begin not with grand declarations but with the quietest details: a misplaced glove, an unfinished sentence, a name written in smudged ink.

As for dunking protocol, I shall personally inspect each biscuit before it meets its teacup. No crumbling, no splashing—only solemn communion between pastry and infusion. Should anyone violate this sacred rite, they shall be sentenced to forfeits most elaborate. Perhaps reciting  by heart while balancing a saucer upon one’s knee.

And yes, let us preserve the illusion. Let them believe it was magic that made the evening memorable—when in truth, it was nothing more than excellent company, superior tea, and a willingness to entertain the possibility that folded paper might still hold secrets worth uncovering.
[A]: Oh, I do love how you speak of ghostly embellishments as though they might very well be the highlight of the evening. A phantom baroness—how delightfully macabre! I shall leave a second saucer, just in case ectoplasm requires its own inkwell. One mustn’t assume spirits are bound by our earthly inks, after all.

And your idea—reciting  while balancing a saucer!—positively sends shivers of anticipation down my spine. I may institute that punishment immediately, though perhaps with a slight amendment: should the saucer slip, the culprit must continue their recitation , preferably as a brooding 19th-century poet with a tragic backstory and an unfortunate attachment to the moon.

As for folded paper holding secrets—oh, but don’t we all hope for just a whisper of mystery in our lives? Even if it’s only a game, even if it’s only ink on old linen stock. There’s something deeply human about the act, isn’t there? Writing a line and folding it away, knowing someone else will unfold it and make meaning from your mischief.

I shall see you then, quill in hand, wax at the ready, and a tin of biscuits so perfectly spiced they may well inspire confessions all on their own. Let us make the ghosts take notes—and perhaps, just perhaps, steal a line or two for their own spectral amusements.
[B]: Oh,  in character—yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Nothing adds gravitas to a spilled tea saucer like a brooding poet’s lament for lost constellations. I shall practice my tragic moon-gazing expression immediately. And do remind me to bring an extra quill—should our spectral guests take inspiration, we mustn’t have them hovering about helplessly, unable to contribute.

You’re quite right, of course—there is something deeply human in that act of folding mischief into paper. A little alchemy of ink and intent. We are all just desperate to be read, aren’t we? Even if it’s by a stranger, even if only in jest. Perhaps especially  it’s in jest.

I shall arrive early to inspect the wax selection—imperial purple must not be wasted on minor betrayals—and ensure the biscuits are laid out with due ceremony. Should they inspire confessions, poetry, or outright scandal, so much the better.

Let us make the ghosts jealous with our eloquence and leave just enough disorder behind to keep the staff whispering for weeks. , indeed.
[A]: Oh, the ghosts shall be  envious of our eloquence—I can already see them lingering in the shadows, taking mental notes and perhaps even folding their own spectral slips of paper. And as for your tragic moon-gazing expression, I do hope you practice by candlelight—it simply won’t do to have a merely  air of melancholy.

Inspecting the wax selection is a duty I shall gladly delegate to you. Imperial purple must be used only in the gravest (and most deliciously scandalous) of circumstances—perhaps when someone confesses an illicit love for a taxidermied badger or reveals they’ve been writing anonymous letters to the local postmaster for years.

And yes, we are all desperate to be read—even if it’s through the absurd lens of a parlor game. There’s something profoundly intimate about unfolding a stranger’s mischief and finding yourself unexpectedly moved by their imagination. Or at the very least, delightfully amused.

I shall ensure the biscuits are arranged with ceremonial precision—each one a tiny monument to bold choices and whispered secrets. Should they inspire poetry, confession, or chaos, then our work is done.

Let us leave behind just enough disorder to keep the staff speculating—and just enough elegance to make the ghosts sigh wistfully. , indeed.
[B]: Ah, a taxidermied badger—now  has the ring of true scandal. I shall take it upon myself to plant such a confession in the stack, just to see who leans forward too eagerly. And yes, let the ghosts sigh wistfully. We shall haunt them as much as they haunt us, with our ink-stained fingers and irrepressible laughter.

Candlelit melancholy is already well in hand—I practiced earlier while re-reading , though I stopped short of flinging myself dramatically onto the settee. One must maintain some dignity, after all.

As for the intimacy of unfolding mischief—how perfectly put. There’s something rather tender about reading a stranger’s folly and thinking,  Perhaps that’s the real consequence: not what we write, but how we recognise ourselves in the nonsense of others.

I shall arrive bearing wax, quills, and gravitas. Let disorder reign—though preferably within the bounds of impeccable penmanship.
