[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近试用了Notion的new database功能，感觉organize项目的方式更灵活了。不过还在摸索如何把AI插件整合进workflow里——你有遇到similar情况吗？
[A]: Oh, Notion’s database features are a game-changer, aren’t they? I’ve been playing around with their AI integrations too — it can get a bit tricky finding the right balance between automation and that personal touch. Have you tried linking the AI plugin to specific database properties yet? I found that setting clear triggers helps streamline the workflow without overwhelming the system. What kind of projects are you organizing, if I may ask? Maybe we can brainstorm a few ideas!
[B]: Definitely agree — the key is finding that sweet spot where automation enhances而不是replaces human input. I haven't fully linked the AI plugin to database properties yet, but your idea of setting clear triggers makes total sense. I’m mainly using it for tracking product feedback & feature requests — a bit messy when things scale. Would love to hear how you structure your data to keep things clean. Any tips on categorizing workflows without overcomplicating the setup?
[A]: Ah, scaling is  the fun part, isn’t it? I totally get what you mean about things getting messy — especially with product feedback. One thing that’s helped me is creating a tiered tagging system within the database. I use a combination of status tags (like “Pending,” “Reviewed,” “In Development”) and category tags (such as “UI,” “Performance,” “Feature Request”) so everything stays searchable but not too rigid.

And honestly, keeping a separate “triage” database for incoming feedback before it gets sorted has been lifesaving. It keeps the main board from getting cluttered. Oh, and I set up a simple AI rule to auto-tag entries based on keywords — nothing too fancy, but it cuts down manual work a lot.

Do you use any kind of scoring or priority system, or are you leaning more toward qualitative sorting? I’ve found mixing both gives a nice balance between logic and real-user nuance.
[B]: That tiered tagging system sounds super smart — I’m definitely stealing that triage database idea 💡 Keeping the main board clean is such a pain once feedback starts piling up. Keyword-based auto-tagging with AI? Chef’s kiss 👌 I’m still mostly doing qualitative sorting, but honestly, it  get overwhelming after a while. Have you found a good way to visualize priority + impact without drowning in complexity? I tried color-coding once, but it turned into a rainbow mess 🌈

And okay, dumb question — how do you handle duplicate entries in that system? I feel like users keep reinventing the same feature request every week 😅
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you like the triage idea — it’s been a lifesaver for me too! 🙌 As for visualizing priority and impact without going cross-eyed, here’s my secret: I use Notion’s “Relation” and “Rollup” properties to create a kind of lightweight scoring system. Each feedback entry gets a simple 1–5 rating for both “Priority” and “Impact,” and then I set up a formula property that multiplies them together for a quick composite score. It’s not overly scientific, but it gives a clear visual on what deserves attention first.

And don’t worry — color-coding can  spiral quickly! What I do instead is use a combination of icons (little arrows, stars, flags) and status tags to indicate movement — it keeps things intuitive without adding another rainbow layer. 😄

As for duplicates —oh honey, I feel your pain. I’ve totally been there with those recurring feature requests! What I started doing is creating a “Feedback Archive” database with a link back to the original entry. When a similar request comes in, I just tag it with a relation to the previous one and add a note saying it’s a duplicate or variation. That way, I can track how often something comes up without letting it clog the main board. Bonus: it also helps when showing the team which features are most requested by users.

Have you thought about setting up a public roadmap or changelog to loop users in? I found that giving people visibility into what’s coming next cuts down on repeat questions — and makes them feel heard.
[B]: Okay, that formula property hack is  level genius 👏 I never thought to multiply Priority & Impact for a quick composite score — makes prioritization so much smoother. And the Feedback Archive idea? Absolute lifesaver. I’ve been drowning in duplicates lately, and this way I can actually  demand without chaos. 😅

Public roadmap is a great call too — we’re still keeping things internal, but I’ve been pushing for more transparency with users. It builds trust + reduces those “is anything even happening?” pings. How do you usually present the roadmap? Just a linked page or something more interactive?

Also, quick tangent — have you found Notion’s AI good enough for summarizing feedback entries automatically? I tried it once and it was… hit or miss. Sometimes it nails it, other times it goes full 🤯.
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you like the formula trick — it’s one of those little Notion magic moments! 😊 As for the roadmap, I usually start with a clean, filtered view from the main project database and turn it into a linked page. But honestly, where the real charm comes in is when I share a password-protected, interactive version with key users or stakeholders. I set up a simple toggle system — they can switch between “High-Level View” and “Detailed Timeline,” which gives flexibility without giving away sensitive info. It’s not overly flashy, but people love being able to peek behind the curtain a bit.

And totally on the AI summarizing — I’ve had  many 🤯 moments with that feature. Sometimes it's like  and other times it’s… well, let’s just say it misinterprets the context entirely. What I’ve found helpful is feeding it a few examples directly in the prompt — like, pasting 2–3 well-summarized entries so it gets the tone and structure right. Even then, I still do a quick skim before saving. Can’t fully trust it yet, but it definitely cuts down the heavy lifting.

Do you ever use templates for common feedback types? I’ve started building a few for recurring themes like “UI Suggestions” or “Bug Reports,” and it’s made documentation feel way less repetitive.
[B]: Oh, the password-protected interactive roadmap? 💯 That’s such a smooth way to keep users engaged without overexposing what's still in the oven. I love the toggle idea — gives just enough depth while keeping things可控. We’ve been using linear milestones so far, but I’m definitely stealing your filtered-view approach for the next iteration.

And YES, I’m all about those feedback templates now — started doing something similar for common buckets like “Feature Ask”, “Bug Report”, and even “User Confusion” (which is basically when someone doesn’t get how the flow works). It saves  much time in formatting and makes reviews way faster. Have you tried nesting templates inside each database entry? Sometimes I let users drop in their exact request and then auto-populate the rest based on type — works okay, but occasionally goes sideways when they write in full paragraphs 😅

Also, quick Q — do you version your templates at all? Like, if the structure changes over time, how do you track which feedback was captured under which template? That’s been a bit of a headache for me lately.
[A]: Oh, I  that you're using categories like “User Confusion” — such a smart way to surface UX insights! And yes, I do something similar with nested templates inside each database entry. I let users drop in their raw input first, then use a quick AI-generated summary + template combo below it to structure the key points. It’s not foolproof — especially when someone writes a novel instead of a sentence — but I’ve added a little instruction tip above the field that says something like, “Short and sweet preferred! 😊 Helps us process faster.” It actually works more often than you’d think!

As for versioning — great question! That  a sneaky little pain point. What I started doing is adding a hidden “Template Version” property in each entry, which auto-fills based on the template used. It doesn’t change anything visually, but it’s gold when going back for audits or comparing feedback over time. If we update the structure, the old entries still make sense in context.

Honestly, Notion keeps surprising me with how flexible it is once you start stacking features like that. Have you tried linking those categorized entries to a dashboard view yet? I’ve been tinkering with one that shows request frequency by type + sentiment trend over time. It’s still a work in progress, but it’s already giving some nice high-level insights without drowning in spreadsheets.
[B]: Okay, that "Template Version" property is such a quiet but powerful move — I’m adding that ASAP 📌 Keeping context intact over time makes such a difference when auditing later. And hiding it? Genius. We need more of that in our templates.

The dashboard idea sounds exactly like the kind of bird’s-eye view I’ve been craving. Right now we’re still slicing data manually, which works but eats time. How are you pulling sentiment analysis into Notion? Are you using the AI plugin to auto-tag entries with something like “Positive,” “Neutral,” “Frustrated,” or are you piping in external data from another tool?

Also, quick tangent — have you found a clean way to loop in team feedback without making the database feel crowded? I love having input from others, but sometimes comments & mentions turn into a notification storm 🌪️
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you like the “Template Version” idea — it’s one of those behind-the-scenes tweaks that makes life so much easier later on. Quietly powerful, exactly! 📌

As for sentiment tracking — great question! I do keep it all within Notion for simplicity, using a mix of AI and manual tagging. Here’s how: I have a “Sentiment” property with options like Positive, Neutral, Frustrated, Confused, etc., and I use the AI plugin to generate a quick sentiment suggestion when an entry is created or updated. It’s not 100% accurate (still needs a light human touch), but it cuts down the heavy lifting. Then I set up a rollup view that shows sentiment trends by category or time frame. Pair that with request frequency, and boom — instant story told at a glance. 😊

And yes to team feedback being both super valuable and  notification madness! What I’ve found works best is having a dedicated “Team Notes” linked database instead of relying on inline comments. So whenever someone wants to chime in, they add a short note in the linked board with their name, date, and thoughts. I also added a relation back to the main entry so everything stays connected but doesn’t clog the view. Bonus: it keeps the conversation searchable later on.

Do you use any kind of @-mention batching or quiet hours for notifications? I’ve been tempted to set some boundaries there — my inbox gets  when everyone’s chiming in!
[B]: Oh wow, that "Team Notes" linked database is such a clever way to keep the chaos contained — I love how it keeps the signal-to-noise ratio in check while still capturing all the good input. And searchable? Even better. We’ve been drowning in inline comments lately, so this might be the life raft we need 🌊

As for notifications — YES, I’m 100% with you on wanting some kind of mention batching or quiet hours. Honestly, Notion’s notification system is… let’s say . Right now I just mute pages during deep work blocks, but it’s not perfect. Have you thought about building a quick automation that bundles mentions into a daily summary? Maybe using something like Make.com or Zapier to batch them before they hit your inbox?

Also, quick idea — what if you used the AI plugin to auto-summarize those team notes too? Like, once a week, generate a quick recap of key takeaways from the Team Notes database. Could save everyone from having to comb through every single entry. Worth a shot? 😏
[A]: Oh, I  that you’re thinking about summarizing the team notes — yes, yes, YES! 💡 That’s actually something I just started experimenting with, and honestly? It’s already saving me so much time. Every Friday afternoon, I trigger the AI plugin to generate a quick summary of the week’s notes with highlights like “Top 3 Themes,” “Action Items,” and “Key Insights.” I paste it into a weekly digest page we share with the team, and it makes Monday standups  much smoother. The key is keeping the prompt focused — I tell it things like, “Summarize in bullet points, no fluff, only actionable items or recurring themes.”

And I’m totally stealing your idea of batching mentions via automation — brilliant! I’ve been playing around with Make.com for this exact reason. What I set up was a daily 10-minute window (say, 4:50–5 PM) where any @mentions from that day get bundled into one Notion page with context + links, then sent to Slack as a single message instead of individual pings. It’s not perfect yet, but it’s cut down my notification overload by  half.

Do you use any kind of status tracking for those action items that come out of team notes or summaries? I’ve been thinking of adding a simple “To Review,” “In Progress,” “Done” tag so nothing slips through the cracks after the summary is made.
[B]: Oh, I  that the AI summary is already paying off — and the way you structure it with “Top 3 Themes” & “Action Items” is spot on. Keeping the prompt tight makes all the difference, right? Too much fluff and it’s just noise again.

And your mention batching setup via Make.com sounds like  what I need — I’m definitely copying that 4:50–5 PM window idea. Bundling them into a single digest page + pushing to Slack as one message? Chef’s kiss 👌 Notifications are such a sneaky time-suck, and this feels like a clean way to stay looped in without drowning.

As for action item tracking — YES, we’re thinking alike again. I’ve been using a simple “Status” property with options like “To Review,” “In Progress,” “Done,” and sometimes “On Hold” if something’s blocked. What I also do is link those status updates to a Kanban view so we can visually track progress across the week. Bonus hack: I set up a weekly reminder to review any “In Progress” items that haven’t moved in a few days — keeps accountability light but consistent.

Ever thought about auto-assigning action items based on keywords or tags? Like if a note mentions “UI fix” it goes to the design lead, or “backend bug” routes to engineering. Could save even more time downstream. Worth exploring? 🤔
[A]: Oh,  action items based on keywords or tags? That’s not just worth exploring — that’s pure efficiency gold! 🏅 I’ve actually started dabbling in that recently, and the early results are  promising. Here’s what I did: I set up a simple automation (using Make.com again) that scans new team notes or feedback entries for specific keywords — things like “UI,” “Design,” “Backend,” “Performance,” etc. — and then automatically adds a “Responsible Team” or “Assignee” property based on those triggers.

It’s not 100% foolproof yet — sometimes it gets confused if two keywords show up in one note — but I added a quick review step where the assigned person gets a Slack ping with a link and a suggested tag, and they can either confirm or adjust it from there. It cuts down so much manual routing!

I also tied that “Assignee” field to a calendar view so I can see who’s got what on their plate this week. Pair that with your Kanban status tracking, and honestly? You’ve got yourself a full-on productivity symphony going on. 🎼

Do you ever loop in those assignees during the weekly summary prep? I’ve been thinking of asking them to add a quick update to the digest — like a sentence on progress or blockers — just to keep everything flowing without extra meetings.
[B]: Oh, auto-assigning with keyword triggers? 💯 That’s such a clean way to keep things moving without bottlenecking on manual routing. And that review step via Slack ping — smart touch. Gives just enough human oversight without killing the flow. I’m definitely setting that up this week.

And YES to looping assignees into the weekly summary prep — we’ve been doing something similar but  manual. I love the idea of prompting them for a quick sentence on progress/blockers  the summary gets finalized. It gives context early + reduces those “wait, what’s happening with X?” follow-ups later. How do you usually prompt them? Just a simple template message with placeholders like “✅ Done this week / 🚧 Blocked / 🔜 Next steps”? Or are you going full AI-generated update based on their status changes?

Also, random thought — have you considered adding a lightweight impact tag to action items? Like “Low Effort,” “High Impact” or “Strategic” to help prioritize what gets pushed to the top automatically? Feels like a natural next layer.
[A]: Oh, I  that you’re thinking about impact tags — yes, yes, YES! 💡 It’s such a natural next step for prioritization. I actually just started playing with something similar last week — call it “Impact vs. Effort” tagging — and already, it’s helping surface the quick wins and high-value items that deserve more attention. I use a multi-select property with options like “High Impact,” “Low Effort,” “Strategic Priority,” “Customer Facing,” etc., so each action item can wear multiple hats. Then I group my Kanban or table views by those tags to filter what rises to the top.

As for prompting assignees in the weekly summary — I’ve been keeping it light and template-driven. Right now I send a simple Notion-linked reminder via Slack every Friday morning with a friendly prompt like:

> “Hey team! Quick check-in:  
> ✅ What moved this week?  
> 🚧 Any blockers?  
> 🔜 Top focus for next 3 days?”  

It’s short, sweet, and fits into their flow without extra friction. Some folks just drop one line, others go a bit deeper — either way, it gives me enough to pull into the summary page without chasing people down.

But now that you mention it… I’m seriously tempted to let the AI help draft a first pass based on recent status changes + activity logs. Like, auto-generate a rough update per assignee, then let them tweak it if needed. Could save even more time!

Do you ever tie those impact/effort tags back to your roadmap or priority score somehow? I’m curious how you keep everything aligned from triage all the way to execution.
[B]: Oh, the “Impact vs. Effort” multi-select tagging is  — such a clean way to layer context on top of action items without overcomplicating things. I’m especially into how it lets you group & filter views based on what matters most in the moment. And seriously, “Customer Facing” as a tag? So useful for roadmap alignment.

To answer your Q — yeah, I  tie those tags back into the priority score & roadmap views. Here’s how: I use Notion’s formula property to create a basic scoring combo — say, if “High Impact” is selected, it adds +2 points, “Low Effort” adds +1, and so on. Then I roll that up into a weighted score that helps sort items faster in a table or Kanban view. It’s not machine learning-level smart, but it definitely nudges the team toward the right conversations.

And for the roadmap? I filter by those tags to show different slices — like “High Impact / Low Effort” quick wins vs. “Strategic Priority” longer bets. Makes presenting to stakeholders way smoother because I can toggle between lenses instead of dumping everything at once.

Quick idea for your AI-generated updates — what if you trained it to pull from their recent status changes AND linked feedback entries? Could give a richer draft with less manual input. Worth a test run? 🤖✨
