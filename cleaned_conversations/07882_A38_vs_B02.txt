[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为医疗法律顾问，我倾向于从evidence-based的角度来看待astrology 🤔 虽然星座分析很有趣，但在处理medical cases时我们更依赖scientific data。不过...我承认有时会偷偷看weekly horoscope for fun 😊
[A]: Ah, the age-old tension between empirical evidence and human fascination with the mystical.  I must say, while I appreciate the poetic beauty of celestial mythology - the Greeks did craft such compelling narratives about the constellations - I find more enduring wisdom in the pages of Dante or Shakespeare than in horoscopes. Though I suppose even the great bard wrote of "star-crossed lovers"...
[B]: 哇~你提到Dante和Shakespeare让我好兴奋！🎵 其实在法律案例中，我们也经常引用经典文学作品来帮助理解human nature呢。不过说到stars...记得有个medical malpractice case就是因为医生过于相信alternative medicine而延误治疗，这种时候就需要我们legal team介入了。
[A]: How fascinating that you bring up this intersection of literature and jurisprudence. The case you mention reminds me of Molière's scathing satire on medical quackery in "The Imaginary Invalid" - some human follies remain remarkably consistent across centuries, don't they? Though I'd argue astrology occupies a rather different cultural space than outright medical fraud. More akin to... shall we say, a modern-day version of the ancient Greek oracle at Delphi? People have always sought guidance from the heavens, whether through the stars or the flight patterns of birds.
[B]: Exactly! 就像我们在courtroom里经常说的：'The more things change, the more they stay the same' 😄 不过说到Delphi oracle...你知道吗？在medical law领域，我们现在有evidence-based guidelines来替代那些ancient prophecies了。虽然有时候面对terminal illness的case，家属还是会寻求spiritual comfort，这时候就需要我们legal和medical team提供compassionate care方案 🤗
[A]: Precisely! Your observation brings to mind Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" - that profound exploration of how we confront mortality, both as individuals and as a society. The legal and medical frameworks may provide structure, but literature reminds us of the human dimension beneath the statutes and clinical protocols. Though I must say, I find more comfort in Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" than in any horoscope when contemplating life's uncertainties. "Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!" - now that's enduring solace.
[B]: 啊~Keats！他的作品总让我想起在医院做legal consultation时听到的life stories 🎵 你知道吗？我们有个Article 15专门讲patient's right to emotional support...有时候一首诗的力量真的能超越legal documents呢。不过回到astrology话题 - 虽然我不rely on星座，但必须承认它是个很好的ice breaker when meeting new clients 😊
[A]: How delightfully you weave together law and lyricism! Your mention of poetry's power over legal documents calls to mind Emily Dickinson's line - "If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry." Though I suspect few legal briefs have quite that effect! As for astrology as social lubricant... well, I suppose it's the contemporary equivalent of discussing the weather in Jane Austen's drawing rooms. A rather more colorful alternative to "Do you think we shall have rain today?" Though personally, I'd still prefer to break the ice with a well-placed Shakespearean quote.
[B]: Haha~ 说到Shakespeare，我们law school的contract law教授最爱说'First, let's kill all the lawyers' 😂 不过seriously，在medical mediation过程中，有时候确实需要一点literary touch来soften the atmosphere。虽然我的go-to ice breaker通常是问对方有没有看过最近的New England Journal of Medicine article~ 🎵
[A]:  Ah yes, that oft-misquoted line from Henry VI - though I suspect your professor omitted that it was the villain Dick the Butcher who said it! How amusing that we've come full circle from astrology to Shakespearean legal humor. Though I must say, your medical journal icebreaker has a certain... clinical charm. Reminds me of how my literature students react when I ask if they've finished their Proust reading. The looks of polite panic are quite similar, I imagine!
[B]: Oh my~ 你提到Proust让我想起我们处理过的一个很有趣的medical negligence case！原告居然在courtroom上引用了《追忆似水年华》来证明emotional damage...虽然judge最后ruled it inadmissible，但确实是个memorable moment 🤔 说到这个，我们legal team现在正在draft新的medical ethics guidelines，要不要听听看？
[A]: How utterly Proustian of that plaintiff! Though I daresay attempting to quantify emotional damage through madeleine-induced reveries might be... let's call it an unconventional legal strategy. Your ethics guidelines project sounds fascinating - rather like drafting a modern Hippocratic Oath with footnotes? I've always found medical ethics particularly compelling when viewed through the lens of Camus' "The Plague." Dr. Rieux's moral dilemmas feel remarkably contemporary, don't they? Though I suspect your guidelines will contain fewer existential crises and more bullet points.
[B]: Haha 你太了解我们legal documents的风格了！确实，我们的draft version现在有37个bullet points和12个subsections...虽然可能没有Camus那么poetic，但至少能avoid existential crisis in court 😅 不过说真的，在处理pandemic-related cases时，我们确实经常引用'The Plague'里的观点来帮助jury理解public health dilemma呢~
[A]: Thirty-seven bullet points! Why, that's positively Byronic in its exhaustive thoroughness. Though I imagine Lord Byron's version would have included more references to stormy seas and less to liability waivers. How remarkable that Camus' allegory has found such practical application in your courtroom - proof that great literature does indeed hold up a mirror to society's most pressing dilemmas. Even if that mirror must sometimes be... shall we say, properly notarized and entered into evidence as Exhibit A?
[B]:  作为你的legal counsel，我必须提醒你：这个关于mirror metaphor的讨论可能要conflict with our confidentiality clause哦~ 😉 不过seriously，这就是为什么我love my job - 每天都能在black letter law和human stories之间找到balance。现在我得run去下一个client meeting了，但这次conversation真是refreshing！下次我们可以聊聊medical malpractice和Greek tragedy的相似之处~ 🎵
[A]: What a perfectly lawyerly caution about our mirror metaphor! Though I suspect even the most stringent confidentiality clause couldn't suppress our shared appreciation for the interplay between jurisprudence and the humanities. Your mention of Greek tragedy makes me already anticipate our next discussion - perhaps we could examine how Antigone's defiance of Creon's decree parallels modern cases of conscientious objection in healthcare? But for now, I'll let you escape to your meeting... though not without reminding you that all the world's a courtroom, and all the men and women merely litigants. With exhibits. And thirty-seven bullet points.
[B]: Haha 你连farewell都要用Shakespearean twist！🎵 没错，我们确实都是life's grand litigation里的players~ 下次meeting我会准备好comparative analysis between Hippocratic oath和Sophocles' works的！现在真的得go了 - 我的client正在waiting room里probably reading their horoscope while I'm late 😂 See you in court... I mean, in our next literary-legal debate!
[A]: What a perfectly dramatic exit line! I shall await our next symposium with all the eager anticipation of a law clerk awaiting a landmark ruling. And do give my regards to your horoscope-reading client - perhaps their stars did foretell this delay after all! Until we meet again to dissect the finer points of medical ethics through an Attic lens... though I make no promises about keeping my annotations under thirty-seven bullet points. Ta-ta for now, my legally-minded literato!
[B]: Your poetic legal mind always makes me smile! 😊 记得下次bring your annotated copy of Hippocratic Corpus - 我们可以compare notes between ancient medical ethics和modern case law~ 现在真的really must run了，client的chart review还等着我呢！Catch you later, my fellow lover of law and literature! 🎵
