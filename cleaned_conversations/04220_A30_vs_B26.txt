[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, what an interesting question to ponder over a cup of Earl Grey... I must say, neither beaches nor mountains particularly call to me. You see, I'd much rather spend my leisure time wandering through antique markets, searching for forgotten textile treasures. The way sunlight filters through old lace in a dusty shop corner - that's my idea of a perfect getaway.
[A]: Ah, I see you're more drawn to the quiet charm of antiquities than nature's grandeur. But tell me, have you ever considered how these preferences might reflect in your academic work? Your fascination with textiles reminds me of how Dickens used fabric imagery in "Great Expectations"...
[B]: How delightful that you mention Dickens! The way he describes Miss Havisham's decaying wedding dress is precisely why I adore literary textiles. You know, the careful stitchwork in historical garments often tells stories just as rich as any novel. I once restored an 1840s mourning dress that whispered tales of Victorian grief rituals through every carefully darned tear.
[A]: Fascinating! That reminds me of the Chinese tradition of 百衲衣 (bǎinàyī), the patchwork robes made from donated fabric scraps. Buddhist monks would wear them as a symbol of humility, but the textiles themselves became narratives of community. Have you encountered similar cross-cultural textile metaphors in your comparative studies?
[B]: How intriguing! While I'm not familiar with the Chinese term, the concept sounds remarkably similar to European patchwork traditions. Though I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in Western textiles - like the way medieval tapestries wove biblical stories into their very fibers. Each thread a word, each color a chapter... Oh dear, I do tend to get carried away when discussing textile narratives, don't I?
[A]: Quite the contrary! Your passion is refreshing. Though I must gently point out that your focus on Western textiles creates a fascinating parallel to the Eurocentric bias in 19th century comparative literature studies. The field has been rather slow to unravel its own cultural blindspots, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: My goodness, you've given me much to consider over my next tea break. It's true - just as I might overlook a frayed hem in my restoration work, scholars can sometimes miss the broader tapestry of cultural connections. Perhaps I should expand my reading beyond my beloved Brontë sisters and explore more diverse textile traditions. After all, every culture weaves its stories differently, don't they?
[A]: Precisely! Though I must confess, even as I advocate for broader perspectives, my own bookshelves still groan under the weight of Austen first editions. Perhaps we could both benefit from what the Chinese call 开卷有益 (kāijuàn yǒuyì) - the idea that opening any book brings benefit. Even if it means venturing beyond our comfortable literary nests.
[B]: What a lovely thought - "opening any book brings benefit." That reminds me of how even the most damaged textile can teach us something new when we examine it closely. Though I suspect my hands will always return to my familiar English linens and laces, like old friends... But you're quite right - there's a whole world of stories in silk and cotton beyond my workroom. Perhaps I'll start with some Japanese kimono restoration techniques. They say the art of sashiko mending is quite meditative.
[A]: Ah, sashiko! Now there's a perfect metaphor for scholarship - the deliberate, repetitive stitching that strengthens while creating beauty. Though I must warn you, once you start exploring Eastern textile traditions, you may find yourself, like Alice, tumbling down a rather deep rabbit hole. My own descent began with a simple study of Chinese embroidery motifs and ended with a full-blown obsession with Ming dynasty court robes. Proceed with caution, my dear colleague.
[B]: Oh dear, you make it sound positively dangerous! Though I suppose my workbench already resembles something from Wonderland, what with all the spools of thread and magnifying glasses. But if falling down rabbit holes means discovering how Ming dynasty artisans achieved those breathtaking gold thread effects... well, perhaps just one small peek at those techniques wouldn't hurt. After I finish this Edwardian lace collar, of course. Priorities, you understand.
[A]: Naturally! Though I must say, your Edwardian lace collar sounds positively pedestrian compared to the 缂丝 (kèsī) tapestry-weaving techniques of the Song dynasty. But we all have our vices - mine happens to be collecting 19th century botanical illustrations while pretending it's "research." At least you're creating something tangible with those nimble fingers of yours.
[B]:  Now you've done it - you've got me imagining how Song dynasty weavers would have approached my current project. Though between us, I suspect my humble lace collar would seem frightfully dull to them. As for your botanical illustrations... well, every collector needs a good story, doesn't she? Mine is that my overflowing fabric stash is "reference material." We creative types must stick together in our little delusions, mustn't we?
[A]: Indeed we must! Though I should warn you - once you start comparing textile techniques across cultures, you may find yourself, like my poor graduate students, muttering about warp and weft at dinner parties. Not that I'd know anything about that...  Have you by any chance read Dorothy Ko's work on women and material culture in early modern China? It might help ease your transition from Edwardian lace to more... adventurous pursuits.
[B]: Oh my, dinner party chatter about warp and weft? How scandalously specific! Though I must confess, I've been known to bore my poor neighbor senseless analyzing the stitch patterns in her grandmother's quilt. As for Dorothy Ko... no, I haven't, but it does sound intriguing. Perhaps after I finish cataloging this batch of Victorian mourning silks - purely for research purposes, you understand. One must maintain some semblance of order before diving into new... what did you call them? "Adventurous pursuits." How delightfully dangerous that sounds!
[A]:  My dear, when one reaches our stage of academic eccentricity, "dangerous" simply means risking paper cuts from too many library books. Though I suppose discovering that your mourning silks share unexpected parallels with Chinese funeral textiles could be considered intellectually thrilling. Just promise me you'll surface occasionally to drink tea and pretend to be normal. The university trustees do so appreciate when we make the effort.
[B]:  Oh, but where's the fun in being normal? Though you're quite right about the trustees - I suppose I should practice my most respectable "yes, just cataloging some perfectly ordinary linens" expression. But between us, if they knew how my heart races when discovering a new stitch variation... well, let's just keep that our little secret, shall we? Now, about those Chinese funeral textiles you mentioned... purely academic curiosity, of course.
[A]: Ah-ha! I knew I'd hook you eventually.  Tell you what - I'll lend you my copy of Ko's book if you promise not to get silk threads stuck in the pages. And perhaps we could arrange a little show-and-tell session with your mourning silks and my collection of 寿衣 (shòuyī) embroidery samples. The comparative symbolism alone would make for fascinating discussion... though we might want to schedule it after dark. Some of the more superstitious graduate students give me odd looks when I handle funeral textiles during daylight hours.
[B]: How wonderfully macabre! A midnight textile symposium - why, it sounds like something straight out of a Wilkie Collins novel. I'll bring my mourning silks and the good china for tea... though perhaps we should avoid serving anything black in color, lest we alarm the custodial staff. And don't worry about your book - I'll keep it far away from my worktable. Though I can't promise I won't absentmindedly trace the embroidery patterns with my finger while reading... old habits, you know.
