[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。前几天店里来了一位常客，是一位天文系的研究生，我们聊到了类似的话题。其实我觉得，宇宙那么大，银河系里有那么多星系，就像我们店里的咖啡豆，每一颗都独一无二。既然如此，很难想象只有地球这一颗“豆子”上有人类存在。

不过说到相信外星人……我就想起我爷爷以前说过的话，他说：“小阳啊，眼界要宽一些，但也要脚踏实地。”所以我现在虽然觉得外星生命存在的可能性很高，但还是更愿意先把眼前这杯咖啡做好，把每一个细节做到极致。

话说回来，你呢？你觉得外星人真的存在吗？
[A]: Interesting analogy with the coffee beans. Though I'd argue most are indistinguishable without a microscope - much like our current capacity to discern extraterrestrial life. Speaking of microscopes, I recently annotated a 1873 edition of Tennyson's "In Memoriam" where he speculates about celestial inhabitants in Canto CXIII. The Victorians had such delightful audacity to blend theology and nascent astronomy.

Your grandfather's advice has textual parallels in George Eliot's "Middlemarch," actually. The tension between cosmic contemplation and quotidian duty... fascinating narrative thread. But to answer directly - statistically the probability approaches certainty, yet empirically? Let's say I maintain a scholarly agnosticism. After all, even Darwin took twenty years to publish his theory.
[B]: Hmm, you make a compelling point. It reminds me of the time I was roasting a batch of Ethiopian beans—delicate work. If I rushed it, they’d become bitter and indistinct, like most mass-produced blends. But with patience, each bean reveals its complexity. Maybe that’s how we should approach the question of life out there—carefully, slowly, willing to wait for the right evidence to surface.

Your mention of Victorian literature… well, I can’t say I’ve read Tennyson closely, but your description makes me want to pick up that edition. There’s something about the way they wrestled with the unknown—thoughtful, yet full of wonder. Not unlike the way I feel when experimenting with new roast profiles.

Statistically speaking, as you said, it’s hard not to lean toward yes. But empirically? I suppose I’m with you—keep the door open, but keep your standards high. After all, even a great cup of coffee starts with a solid foundation. Speaking of, have you ever tried cold brew made from Sumatra? I've been tweaking the grind and water temp—might be just the thing to accompany a good philosophical conversation.
[A]: Ah, experimentation with roast profiles - I detect a kindred spirit. The Victorians would've roasted their metaphors alongside those beans, I suspect. Speaking of foundations, have you considered the chemical parallels between chlorogenic acids and poetic meter? Both break down under heat and pressure to reveal hidden complexities... much like syllogistic reasoning under dialectic scrutiny.

Sumatra, you say? Intriguing. Reminds me of an obscure 1890 monograph I uncovered last autumn - "The Effects of Tropical Roasting on Colonial Digestion" - though it curiously never mentions caffeine. Perhaps they feared censorship by the Temperance League. Tell me, what temperature range are you finding optimal for that particular terroir? I've been composing a sonnet sequence comparing extraction methods to literary forms - espresso as villanelle, cold brew as free verse...
[B]: That’s a brilliant comparison—espresso as villanelle, cold brew as free verse. I might have to steal that line for my next customer chat. There’s something poetic about the way pressure and time shape both flavor and thought.

As for Sumatra, I’ve been working mostly in the 210°C to 218°C range during the Maillard phase—trying to coax out those deep, earthy notes without losing the brightness underneath. It’s a delicate balance, like trying to translate a poem without flattening its meaning. Funny you mention chlorogenic acids too—I’ve been reading up on how they break down during roasting. Almost philosophical, isn’t it? The way structure gives way to expression under pressure.

That monograph sounds like a hidden gem. I can imagine the tension—writing about coffee but dancing around caffeine. Must’ve been quite the tightrope walk. Temperance or not, at least they left us with something to ponder.

Say, if you’re ever in the neighborhood, bring that sonnet sequence by. I’ll brew a fresh pot of Sumatra and we can workshop it over a cup—or should I say, a stanza.
[A]: Ah, a workshop over coffee and iambic pentameter—how delightfully anachronistic. I do hope you’re not expecting rhyme royal from a Sumatra roast, though. One must respect the terroir  the meter.

As for those chlorogenic acids, imagine them as suppressed sonnets in the bean’s original DNA—unraveling under heat like forbidden verses burned then resurrected from ash. A touch dramatic? Perhaps. But no more so than Browning’s use of enjambment to mimic the soul’s hesitations.

I’ll bring the sonnets, yes—but only if you promise to critique them with the same rigor you apply to third-wave roasting. And don’t think I haven’t noticed your sly substitution of "customer chat" for casual banter. You're clearly a literary conspirator in disguise.
[B]: Oh, I’ll give you rhyme royal in a Sumatra roast—deep, structured, and unfolding in couplets of flavor. You want drama? Wait until you taste the finish; it lingers like a volta in a Petrarchan sonnet.

Forbidden verses resurrected from ash—now that’s a tasting note I could put on the board. Next thing you know, we’ll be comparing extraction yields to textual variants in Shakespeare’s quartos.

As for customer chats… well, let’s just say running a coffee shop teaches you to speak in footnotes and marginalia. Every regular brings their own narrative, and sometimes you become part of it—like a recurring motif or an inside joke only a few get.

Critique your sonnets? Of course. But fair warning—I taste-test my opinions before serving. And I expect the same from a literary guest: no soft landings, no sugarcoating. If the meter’s off, I’ll let you know. Promise.

So set your stanzas aside for next week. I’ll have the Sumatra ready—and maybe a Guatemalan blend to pair with your enjambments.
[A]: Exquisite. I shall compose with the Sumatra’s terroir in mind—tertiary stanzas grounded yet yielding a subtle finish. Do remind me to bring my 1904 edition of —there’s a charming footnote comparing Italian roast to iambic trimeter that may prove...inspirational.

A Guatemalan for enjambments? Bold choice. I trust you’ll grind it fine enough to match the syntactic tension. Speaking of tension, prepare yourself—I do not flinch from caustic critique, nor from administering it. If your palate detects a false stress in my scansion, call me on it. Think of it as a kind of literary cupping: blind tastings of verse, where aroma gives way to argument.

Next week, then. I do hope your grinder’s burrs are ready for such elevated company.
[B]: Oh, the burrs are sharpened and waiting—just like my ear for a misplaced stress. Bring that 1904 edition, by all means. I’ve always believed coffee, like poetry, demands a certain historical imagination. I can already picture your footnote beside today’s roast log—future barista scholars will marvel at our correspondence.

Guatemala for enjambments—I stand by it. There's a reason that soil produces such lively acidity, much like a well-placed enjambment keeps the mind moving forward. I’ll dial in the grind just shy of espresso fineness; we want the extraction to unfold, not conclude too soon.

And literary cupping? Blind tastings of verse? Now you’re speaking my language. Let’s see if I can’t detect origin notes in your meter—Was this quatrain influenced by Romantic altitude? Is that volta a highland burst of clarity?

Next week, then. Chair reserved, cupping bowls ready, and ears tuned to the rhythm of honest critique. And don’t worry—I’ll make sure the place smells like anticipation.
[A]: Ah, anticipation as an aroma—one must distill that into a sonnet sometime. I shall arrive with my quatrains properly aerated and my volta sealed in wax. Let us hope the barometric pressure doesn't disturb the scansion.

Romantic altitude, you say? I do have a sonnet that was penned at 1,200 meters above sea level—though whether it was the elevation or the absinthe remains a textual crux. And yes, by all means, let your palate identify prosodic terroirs. Was this couplet aged in oak or simply left too long in the press?

I look forward to your extraction method—shall we pair each stanza with a different pour-over technique? A Chemex for the grandiose openings, a V60 for the delicate transitions... Perhaps even a French press for those dense, self-referential footnotes.

Next week, then. I shall wear my green eyeshade in tribute—not for the banker’s hours, but for the color of literary envy & caffeinated ambition.
[B]: A sonnet steeped in anticipation—now there’s a brew worth aging. Wax-sealed volatillas, altitude-induced meter… I can already tell this will be a tasting like no other.

That 1,200-meter sonnet sounds like a high-altitude roast—bold and slightly wild, maybe with a hint of herbal complexity. And the absinthe? Let’s just say it adds an unexpected origin note. As for your couplet’s finish—oaked or over-pressed? I’ll reserve judgment until the cupping. Trust me, I’ve tasted enough dark, tannic blends to recognize a heavy hand in both poetry and brewing.

Pour-over pairings by stanza? Brilliant. I was already thinking of pacing—slow, circular infusions for the exposition, sharper pulses for the turns. Chemex for the grand declarations, yes. The clarity of that glass vessel demands nothing less than dramatic openings. And the V60—perfect for those subtle shifts in tone, where too much pressure ruins the balance. Even the French press has its place among footnotes; some ideas need a little turbulence to release their depth.

Green eyeshade—wonderful touch. I’ll have a small batch of anaerobic-fermented beans ready, just for contrast. They carry a strange, almost literary funk, like a forgotten marginalia rediscovered.

Next week, then. Prepare your palate—and your red pen. We may yet redefine what it means to taste a poem.
[A]: Ah, anaerobic fermentation—how delightfully subversive. That literary funk sounds like a lost canto from , half-rotted and twice as compelling. I shall bring my most erudite nasal cavity and a lexicon of tasting adjectives borrowed from Ruskin’s descriptions of Venetian stone.

Shall we institute a new critical method? Oenological close reading, perhaps? Or —the careful unlayering of bouquet and meaning alike. Expect my red pen to bleed ink into your margins, just as the beans bleed oils into their parchment. I do hope your anaerobic experiment wasn't aged in metaphysical doubt; nothing ruins a sonnet like excessive self-interrogation before first light.

And pacing—marvelous point. One must attend to the rhythm of extraction as closely as to enjambment. Too quick a pour, and the argument goes flat. Too slow, and the bitterness lingers past its welcome. I trust your hands are steady, Professor of Roast & Refrain.

Next week, then. Prepare the Chemex like an opening parenthesis—I intend to finish full stop.
[B]: Ah, —I may have to steal that for my next tasting note. There's something deeply satisfying about peeling back the layers of a roast like a palimpsest, each stratum whispering its secrets in aroma and afterthought.

Ruskin and Venetian stone—now  a flavor profile I’d love to map. Maybe we’ll find some shared vocabulary: "crumbling yet persistent," "dark with the weight of centuries," or my personal favorite, "a finish so long it becomes architectural."

As for metaphysical doubt—I assure you, the beans were aged only in darkness, not in indecision. Though now that you mention it, I did roast them while re-reading a rather dense chapter of Walter Benjamin’s . Perhaps that counts as ambient doubt.

And pacing—yes. Every great cup has its cadence, just as every sonnet finds its breath. I’ll keep the pour steady, the kettle warm, and the Chemex poised like your opening parenthesis. Finish full stop? I expect nothing less.

Next week, then. Save me a margin, will you? I’ve a feeling your red pen and my roast log shall converse at length.
[A]: Ah, a palimpsest of roast and reason—how very Oxford Comma. I shall bring extra parchment for your marginalia; I suspect my red pen may achieve something between commentary and collateral damage.

Benjamin’s  as ambient atmosphere? Bold move. No wonder those beans emerged with a finish like flânerie—meandering yet methodical. Tell me, did you hear echoes of Baudelaire in the crackle of first crack?

And "dark with the weight of centuries"—yes, that must be the flavor note we serve alongside sonnets aged in lead-lined cellars. I do hope your customers are ready for such terroir-driven profundity.

Keep the Chemex poised, the kettle philosophical, and the stanzas aerated. I shall arrive precisely three minutes before drip time, carrying footnotes and a faint scent of bergamot.

Next week, then. Let us make the baristas blush with erudition—and perhaps a touch of caffeine-induced clarity.
[B]: Baudelaire in the first crack—now  a tasting note I’d serve with pride. There’s something undeniably poetic about the moment the beans start to sing, like the opening line of a forgotten ode. And if Benjamin’s ghost lingers in the cup, well… let’s just say I’ll take profundity wherever I can find it.

Your footnotes arriving three minutes before drip time? Perfect timing. That’s when the café’s quietest—just enough background hum for atmosphere, but not so much it drowns out the meter. Bergamot, you say? I’ll make sure the Earl Grey is far from reach—this is Sumatra’s hour, after all.

As for the baristas blushing with erudition… I’ve warned them. They’re expecting Latin tags and possibly a debate over whether oxidation improves verse as well as wine. One of them has even started scribbling sonnets on the roast logs—dangerous precedent, but I admire the spirit.

Next week, then. Three minutes before drip time. Chemex poised, parchment ready, and a pot of Guatemalan blend warming up for enjambments. Bring your red pen, your footnotes, and that faint scent of bergamot—I’ll have the kettle steeped in quotation.
[A]: Ah, sonnets on roast logs—dangerous indeed, but I approve of the sedition. Let them scribble! Future archivists will marvel at our caffeinated renaissance, inked in coffee oil and iambic.

Three minutes before drip time... yes, that liminal hour when all things steep toward revelation. I shall arrive bearing a 1922 pamphlet I recently acquired—. The margins are blissfully empty, and I intend to keep them so no longer.

Quotation-steeped kettle? How very Virgilian. I do hope you’ve selected your citations with care—nothing ruins a good cup like a misplaced Horace reference. And save the Guatemalan enjambments for my fourth stanza; I find its acidity pairs splendidly with syntactic suspense.

Next week, then. Bergamot in hand, Latin tags at the ready, and a red pen thirstier than a dry-aged barrel. Let us make extraction literary—and may your Chemex never tilt toward prose.
[B]: A caffeinated renaissance—yes, let the baristas revolt in verse! I’ve already started seeing iambic scrawls on the tamper handles. Dangerous? Perhaps. But I suspect this is how movements begin—with a little bitterness, a lot of heat, and just enough pressure to transform something ordinary into a revelation.

That 1922 pamphlet sounds like the kind of text that demands slow sipping and careful annotation. Bring it by all means—I’ve always believed roasting, like reading, is an act of interpretation. And misinterpretation, if the roast is bold enough.

Virgilian kettle? Now you’re flattering me. Let’s just say I steeped it in something between Catullus and Coleridge—classical heat with a romantic finish. And misplaced Horace? Perish the thought. Though I suppose even odes deserve the occasional remix.

Guatemalan enjambments for your fourth stanza—consider it timed to the second pour. I’ll make sure the bloom is slow enough to build suspense, and the final drawdown lingers just past the caesura.

Next week, then. Bergamot, Latin tags, and a red pen thirsty as a dry-aged barrel—sounds like the perfect blend of menace and muse. Let the extraction commence.
[A]: Ah, a movement born of pressure and transformation—how very . I can already see the headlines:  Future scholars shall debate whether it began with a misplaced metaphor or a perfectly timed bloom.

That 1922 pamphlet, I suspect, was penned by a man who roasted his own sonnets over an open flame—half-charred, half-genius. We shall treat it as we do a rare broadside: with reverence, ink-stained fingers, and a willingness to risk catastrophe for clarity.

Catullus and Coleridge in the same kettle? Bold fusion. I detect a tendency toward the sublime with reckless abandon—a school of thought I heartily endorse. And odes remixed? Why not? Even Horace borrowed from the Greeks; let us borrow from the beans.

Fourth stanza enjambments timed to the second pour—precisely the kind of structural daring that keeps both poetry and extraction honest. A slow bloom to build tension, a final drawdown that defies expectation... yes, I can already taste the cadence.

Next week, then. Let the rebellion steep. I shall arrive three minutes before drip time, parchment in hand, red pen primed, and spirit appropriately caffeinated. May our margins overflow—and may no barista be left un-versed.
[B]: —I love it. Sounds like the title of a forgotten modernist manifesto. And if it takes a misplaced metaphor to start a movement, then I say: let the misreadings begin. After all, wasn’t  itself just Wordsworth’s roast log, eventually bound in leather?

That pamphleteer from 1922? Oh, I can picture him now—hunched over his roaster, muttering sonnets between cracks of heat. Half-charred, as you said, but burning bright. We’ll treat his work with the care it deserves—ink-stained fingers, whispered annotations, and maybe even a little incantation over the burr grinder.

Catullus and Coleridge together—reckless, perhaps, but sublime. One moment, a sharp Latin sting; the next, mist and moonlight. I think coffee, like poetry, demands that kind of range. You have to risk bitterness to find sweetness, just as you must flirt with chaos to find form.

And yes—your fourth stanza will bloom on time, I promise. Tension built slow, release deliberate. No rushed extraction here, only careful unfolding. Let the final drawdown linger past the expected turn—like a line that refuses to end where you think it should.

Next week, then. Three minutes before drip time. I’ll save you the best seat, the sharpest pencil, and a freshly wiped cupping slate. The Chemex stands ready, the parchment awaits, and the baristas? Well, I suspect they’re already drafting their next lines.

Let the rebellion steep.
