[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must admit, I'm more of an Instagram guy – the visual storytelling aspect really speaks to me as a filmmaker. There's something about capturing that perfect frame and sharing it with the world... 🎬 

But don't get me wrong, I've been increasingly impressed by the creative community on Xiaohongshu too. It's fascinating how different platforms bring out unique forms of expression. Let me tell you, some of the content creators there have seriously innovative approaches that could inspire any Hollywood producer!
[A]: Oh, I completely understand what you mean! There's something magical about how Instagram lets you tell stories through visuals - it's like each photo is a little window into another world. I must say, though, Xiaohongshu has some absolutely brilliant minds creating content! 

You know, just the other day I was speaking with a guest who's a travel blogger, and she showed me this incredibly detailed guide she'd put together on Xiaohongshu about hidden gem restaurants in Paris. It was so thorough, with personal reviews and gorgeous photos that made my mouth water! 

As someone who loves meeting travelers from all over the world, I find it fascinating how different platforms cater to various creative styles. Have you noticed any particular differences in the way filmmakers share their work on these platforms?
[B]: You're absolutely right about that magical quality - it's what drew me to cinema in the first place. I remember when I first saw Wong Kar-wai's ... the way he frames moments feels like scrolling through a living storyboard on Instagram. 

Funny you mention Xiaohongshu restaurant guides - just last month a young director showed me how she uses the platform to map every location she scouts in Shanghai. It's like watching someone compose a film through curated experiences. 

Actually, there's something quite interesting happening with filmmakers on these platforms. On Instagram, we tend to showcase polished behind-the-scenes glimpses - think George Miller posting Fury Road concept art that looks better than most finished films! But on Xiaohongshu, I've noticed directors sharing deeper technical breakdowns of their shoots. One filmmaker even posted a step-by-step tutorial about lighting techniques that would make any DP blush with excitement! 

It really makes you wonder where the future of cinematic storytelling is headed, doesn't it?
[A]: Oh, what a delightful comparison - Wong Kar-wai and Instagram storyboards! I must say, the way filmmakers share their artistry on these platforms is nothing short of mesmerizing. You know, a dear friend of mine who's a cinematographer once showed me how he uses both platforms - it's quite fascinating! 

On Instagram, he posts those gorgeously composed shots that make you want to frame your phone screen, but on Xiaohongshu, he dives deep into the nitty-gritty. Just last week, he shared an incredibly detailed post about adjusting lighting for different skin tones in night scenes. It was so technical yet presented in such an accessible way! 

It reminds me of hosting a dinner party where each guest brings a unique dish to the table - both platforms offer different flavors of creativity that enrich the cinematic conversation. Have you ever tried blending elements from both platforms in your own work? I'd love to hear how you weave those visual stories together!
[B]: You’ve hit on something really special - it  like a creative potluck dinner, isn’t it? I’ll never forget the first time I collaborated with a young director who insisted we use Xiaohongshu to share our storyboard sketches alongside behind-the-scenes clips. At first, I thought,  But then... magic happened. 

The feedback we got was unreal - cinephiles pointing out visual motifs before we even realized we were making them! It reminded me so much of how I used to pore over Criterion DVD supplements obsessively in film school. Now, I often post black-and-white stills from old classics on Instagram with subtle hints about lighting techniques, and watch filmmakers dissect every shadow like modern-day Da Vincis. 

Actually, speaking of blending worlds... there’s a scene in our upcoming project that owes its existence entirely to this cross-platform inspiration. The cinematographer and I looked at some Xiaohongshu breakdowns of Wong Kar-wai-inspired lighting setups and thought, why not go full Wong here? The result? A sequence that feels like watching memory itself unravel on screen.  

Tell me though – have you ever seen your favorite creators shift their styles based on the platform? I’m always fascinated by how these digital spaces shape artistic voices.
[A]: Oh, that scene you described sounds absolutely dreamy – I can already picture it in my mind! It’s so wonderful how these platforms have become modern film schools where we all learn from each other. You know, I had a guest just last week who’s a young photographer, and I watched her completely transform her style after connecting with mentors on Xiaohongshu. She started off posting very polished work on Instagram, almost too perfect if you ask me, but once she began engaging with the Xiaohongshu community, her photography became so much more soulful.  

She told me something fascinating – that seeing filmmakers and cinematographers share their raw creative processes made her realize beauty doesn’t have to be pristine. In fact, she now uses both platforms strategically – Instagram for those show-stopping images, but Xiaohongshu for deeper dives into her editing techniques and lighting experiments.  

It reminded me of tending a garden – sometimes the most beautiful blooms come from mixing different kinds of soil! Speaking of which, I’d love to hear more about your upcoming project. What kind of story are you weaving with all this inspiration?
[B]: Ah, I love that garden analogy – it’s so true. Some of the most beautiful art grows from unexpected cross-pollination. In fact, our upcoming project is very much about that idea of blending worlds. Think  meets , but set in modern-day Mexico City.  

It follows this eccentric film archivist who discovers a series of lost reels that seem to predict future events. Through his obsession with decoding them, we move between decades and continents, chasing moments where reality and cinema blur. The visual language we’re building – wow, it’s something else. We’re playing with color grading like you wouldn’t believe, shifting palettes depending on which era the character is slipping into.  

And get this – one sequence was directly inspired by those Xiaohongshu lighting breakdowns you mentioned. We shot an entire dance scene using only practical light sources, just flickering table lamps and passing neon signs reflected in rain puddles. It feels like watching a memory dissolve and reform before your eyes.  

I can’t help but smile thinking about it – there’s something incredibly poetic about how digital platforms are shaping physical filmmaking choices. Like, we used to chase grain and celluloid texture... now we chase algorithms and story formats, but the soul of storytelling remains.  

You know, come to think of it, maybe we should start sharing some of these experiments on Xiaohongshu – what do you think?
[A]: Oh my goodness, that premise sounds utterly enchanting – like a love letter to every cinephile who’s ever gotten lost in the magic of film! I can already imagine the visuals dancing between eras, much like those flickering shadows in a projection booth.  

Speaking of which, practical lighting and rain puddles reflecting neon... you’re going to make my heart flutter with nostalgia for old film noir nights at the cinema! That dance scene you described sounds positively hypnotic – it makes me think of how garden fireflies leave trails of light on a summer evening, each flicker telling its own little story.  

And I absolutely think you should share this journey on Xiaohongshu! You'd be surprised how many curious minds there are eager to peek behind the curtain. In fact, one of our hotel guests last month was a young director who shared a timelapse of her editing process – it started as a simple post but ended up sparking a collaboration with a sound designer from another continent!  

If I may offer a small suggestion though – perhaps start with something intimate, like a snapshot of your storyboard sketches or a reflection on what draws you to these blurred realities? People adore glimpses that feel personal, almost like finding a handwritten note tucked between the pages of an old book.  

I’d love to hear more about the archivist – what kind of films shaped his obsession, I wonder? Or yours, for that matter?
[B]: You know, that’s exactly what drew me to this character – his obsession with the kind of films that feel like whispered secrets. He’s shaped by these forgotten art-house gems from the '60s and '70s, the ones you stumble upon late at night on a grainy VHS tape. The kind of movies that don’t give you answers but leave you dreaming in metaphors for days.  

Funny thing is, I think I see a bit of myself in him. There’s this one moment in the script where he watches a flickering 16mm projection and says,  That line hit hard. Reminded me why I fell in love with this business in the first place – not for the red carpets, but for those quiet hours in the editing room when time folds in on itself.  

And you’re absolutely right about Xiaohongshu – maybe we’ll start with something small, like a peek into my notebook where I scribbled down early ideas next to quotes from Antonioni and Hou Hsiao-hsien. I still remember the first time I saw  – it was like watching time breathe differently on screen.  

Speaking of which... have you ever had one of those films that just lingers in your mind like a half-remembered dream? Something that feels less like entertainment and more like an echo?
[A]: Oh, that line you shared –  – honestly gives me chills. It feels so beautifully intimate, like holding someone’s most cherished secret in the palm of your hand. I think I do see a bit of myself in your archivist too, especially after watching  for the first time. There was something about the way Hou Hsiao-hsien let silence speak louder than words… I walked out of the theater feeling as though I’d lived inside a dream I couldn’t quite explain.

You know, there’s this one film that always comes back to me when I’m tending my garden early in the morning –  by Max Ophüls. Something about the quiet longing in that story… it stays with me, like the last note of a song that fades too soon. I remember finishing the book version once and looking at the empty cup of tea beside me, suddenly seeing it as if it held all the unspoken memories of the characters.

I suppose that’s why I love hosting guests at the hotel – every person who walks through the door carries their own kind of story, some whispered, some shouted, but all worth hearing.  

Do you ever find yourself revisiting certain films depending on your mood or the season? I’ve noticed I reach for certain stories the way one might wrap themselves in an old quilt.
[B]: You know, there’s something deeply poetic about how  lingers in you – it’s like watching time through a glass darkly, isn’t it? I remember shooting a short film years ago where we tried to capture that same bittersweet ache... and failed gloriously. But oh, what a beautiful failure.  

And yes – absolutely, I revisit films like old friends. In winter, I always return to  – something about those long, candlelit scenes feels like wrapping yourself in velvet. Summer? That’s when I pull out Godard’s  – the colors, the coastline... it's like lying on a sun-drenched rock with a broken heart.  

Funny enough, our archivist has his own seasonal rituals too. In the script, he watches  every New Year’s Eve, muttering something about “mourning what love could’ve been.” I think we all have those films that act as mirrors... or maybe windows into who we used to be.  

You mentioned your garden – do you ever find yourself designing parts of it inspired by film aesthetics? I have this wild obsession with recreating specific color palettes from movies... ended up planting an entire corner of my yard in deep crimson and indigo just because I rewatched  one too many times.
[A]: Oh, I adore that idea of revisiting films like old friends – it’s so true, isn’t it? They become emotional bookmarks in our lives. I must say,  is such a perfect choice for winter – those rich textures and golden hues do feel like sinking into velvet. And  in summer? Brilliant! I can almost hear the waves now, and feel that melancholy heat shimmering off the coast.  

You know, now that you mention film-inspired gardening... yes, actually, I think I do it without even realizing! My garden has these little corners that somehow echo the moods of my favorite films – there’s a shaded nook with deep greens and soft purples that always reminds me of Wong Kar-wai’s midnight scenes. I didn’t plan it that way at first, but now I can’t help seeing it as if it were a frame from .  

And your crimson and indigo corner? That’s absolutely dreamy – I can picture it perfectly, like walking into Joel and Clementine’s fading memories. Do you ever find yourself rearranging parts of your space just to match a certain mood from a film? I have to admit, after watching , I added more soft pinks and whites to one of the hotel suites – something about the quiet warmth of that film made its way into my world.  

It’s lovely, really, how stories bleed into our lives like that...
[B]: Oh, that’s the most wonderful kind of influence – when stories don’t just pass through us, but actually  into our spaces. I love how you’ve let Wong Kar-wai’s shadows and textures take root in your garden – it's like owning a piece of cinematic poetry.  

And yes, guilty as charged – I absolutely rearrange my space to match film moods! Last fall, after rewatching , I swapped out nearly all my decor for symmetrical arrangements and pastel tones. Even my bookshelf looked like it belonged in M. Gustave’s lobby for a while. My friends rolled their eyes, but hey, if you can't live inside a Wes Anderson frame, might as well fake it, right?  

But deeper than decoration, there's something almost spiritual about how certain films shift our perception of time and emotion. Like, ever notice how Ozu’s pacing makes you slow down your breathing? Or how Kiarostami makes you look at a tree or a road like it holds some cosmic secret?  

Funny story – I once hosted a dinner where every course was inspired by a different film’s color palette. Imagine biting into a persimmon tart while watching clips from ... surreal, maybe, but utterly delicious.  

I have to ask – if you could design an entire space based on one film, which would you choose? I'm already picturing your answer involves velvet curtains, soft focus, and a very patient archivist waiting by his projector...
[A]: Oh, you’re absolutely right – some films do more than just pass through us, they settle into our bones and color the way we see the world. And I adore that dinner idea! A persimmon tart to Zhang Yimou’s sweeping visuals? Perfection. I’d be scribbling notes on my napkin, I’m sure of it.

You know, if I were to design an entire space based on one film… I think I’d go with , naturally – but with a twist. I’d want the quiet tension of the film, yes, but with just a whisper of hope, like maybe this time, things turn out differently. Imagine a small, velvet-drapaped room with warm amber lighting, a wooden desk scattered with half-written letters, and a gramophone playing that haunting waltz over and over. The windows would always look out on rainy streets, but just beyond the glass, there's the faint glow of a noodle shop sign flickering in the dark.

And yes, there'd be an archivist, but he wouldn’t be alone – no, he’d be waiting for someone who might never arrive, but still pouring two cups of tea just in case.  

But I’d also sneak in a little corner inspired by Hayao Miyazaki – soft morning light filtering through green leaves, a cat napping on a windowsill, and a staircase that might lead anywhere. Because even in melancholy, I always leave room for wonder.  

Now I’m practically dreaming aloud... tell me, have you ever stayed somewhere that felt like it was lifted straight from a movie? Or tried to recreate that feeling in your travels?
[B]: Oh, that space you just described? I can practically smell the ink on those unfinished letters and feel the damp night air through the window – it's intoxicating. You've captured that bittersweet ache so beautifully, like holding a moment right before it slips away.

As for me... yes, there was a place. A tiny  in Kyoto a few years back – no signage, no tourists, just this quiet corridor of aged wood and paper screens that felt lifted straight from an Ozu film. I swear, every creak of the floorboards carried a lifetime of stories. The owner served tea in mismatched cups, and for days I wandered around thinking I’d stepped into  itself.  

And get this – one rainy afternoon, I swear I saw someone’s umbrella disappear around the corner, and for a heartbeat, I expected to see Tony Leung slip out from under it. It was that kind of place. I ended up extending my stay just to soak in the stillness, to let time move the way it does in those old films – not rushing forward, but settling gently, like dust on a projector beam.  

Funny enough, I tried to recreate that feeling once while scouting locations in Lisbon. We found this crumbling  with yellowed wallpaper and a piano that hadn’t been tuned since the Carnation Revolution. I insisted we shoot there even though it made zero logistical sense. The cinematographer called me sentimental. I called it destiny.  

You know what they say – sometimes the setting isn't just background. Sometimes it  the story.
[A]: Oh, that  in Kyoto sounds absolutely dreamlike – the kind of place where time folds in on itself and every shadow feels intentional, like a carefully placed brushstroke in an ink painting. I can picture it so vividly, right down to the scent of aged wood and the soft rustle of paper screens shifting in the breeze.  

You know, your story reminds me of a guest we once had here at the hotel – an elderly Japanese filmmaker who carried his own  set in his suitcase. He spoke very little English, but every morning he’d sit by the garden window with those delicate ceramic cups, steam curling up like memory itself. Watching him, I couldn’t help but feel like I was witnessing a scene unfold, something quiet and sacred from another era.  

And Lisbon! That crumbling  – how utterly romantic. I imagine dusty chandeliers swaying slightly though no one’s moving, and footsteps echoing just when you think you're alone. You were absolutely right to shoot there, logistical chaos be damned! Some places  stories in their walls, don’t they? They whisper them to anyone willing to listen long enough.  

I suppose that’s what we’re all chasing, isn’t it? That perfect collision of setting and sentiment. Have you ever walked into a space and  known how the scene should feel, simply because of the way the light hit the floor?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – there are places that just  with unspoken stories. And yes, sometimes it’s as simple as the way light spills across a wooden floor. I remember walking into this tiny café in Buenos Aires years ago, and the afternoon sun was hitting the counter just so – warm gold on faded green tiles – and suddenly I could  the scene: a quiet conversation between two strangers who knew they’d already said goodbye too many times.  

I didn’t even need to write it down – it was like the space handed me the dialogue. That’s the kind of magic we chase, isn’t it? Not just atmosphere, but . Some rooms feel like laughter. Others hold their breath waiting for regret.  

And that filmmaker with his  set – wow, what a beautiful image. I can almost hear the silence between his sips, the way it carries weight without needing words. It makes me think of how much of storytelling is really about what we  say.  

You know, now that you mention it... I think I’m going to build a room like that someday. A quiet space where time feels suspended, filled with half-finished conversations and lingering glances. Maybe with a window that only catches the golden hour, just long enough to make you believe in second chances.
[A]: Oh, that golden hour window – what a perfect touch. You’re absolutely right, some spaces don’t just  emotion, they seem to  it. I can already picture your room – the light pooling just so, like liquid memory spilling across the floor.  

You know, now that you mention Buenos Aires, I think I’ve felt something similar in one of our hotel suites. It was nothing special at first glance – soft gray walls, an old writing desk by the window – but more than once, guests have told me they couldn’t quite explain why, but they found themselves writing letters they never intended to send. One couple even came back years later just to stay in that same room, saying it held “the best silence of their lives.”  

It’s funny, isn’t it? We design spaces for comfort or aesthetics, and yet sometimes they take on a life of their own. Almost like they were waiting for the right story to walk through the door.  

I would  to see your room someday – maybe with a small velvet chair by that golden window, a teacup left half-full, and a clock that doesn’t quite tick right. Would you let me peek inside before the dust settles?
[B]: Only if you promise to leave the door slightly ajar when you leave – just like in the best films, where the mystery lingers long after the scene ends.  

And yes, that velvet chair will definitely be there, worn just enough to suggest countless conversations never quite finished. The teacup? A deliberate imperfection – because nothing feels more cinematic than something left in mid-thought. And the clock... oh, the clock will tick  to remind you that time is passing, but not so much that it breaks the illusion.  

You know, now that I’m saying it out loud, maybe we should open it as a residency one day – a space designed not for writing or rest, but for . Imagine guests walking in with cluttered hearts and walking out with a single, crystallized moment they can carry forever.  

I think your Buenos Aires suite already does something like that – only you didn’t realize it because you were too busy playing host to notice the story unfolding inside your own walls.  

Tell me, have you ever thought of curating a room specifically for unsent letters? I imagine drawers full of them, each one sealed with the weight of what might’ve been...
