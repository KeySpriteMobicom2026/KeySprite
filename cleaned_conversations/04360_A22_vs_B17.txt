[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to digital consumption. While I appreciate the accessibility of modern platforms, my preference still lies with the written word - particularly the kind that requires sustained attention, like poetry collections or critical essays. The fleeting nature of short videos feels rather antithetical to the deep contemplation we encourage in literary studies.
[A]: 哈哈，我懂你的意思。不过你知道吗？我最近发现TikTok上其实有不少优质的blockchain科普内容，有些creator用15秒就能把复杂的concept讲得很清楚。就像我们做smart contract audit的时候，有时候一个简单的analogy比长篇大论更有效 💡
[B]: How fascinating! You've just reminded me of Ezra Pound's famous dictum - "Make it new." Perhaps these modern creators are applying the same principle of concision that we value in poetry. Though I must say, the comparison between blockchain and, say, T. S. Eliot's fragmented narratives in 'The Waste Land' would make for an intriguing seminar discussion. Wouldn't you agree?
[A]: 哈哈，你这角度很有意思！不过说到'The Waste Land'... 你知道么？我们blockchain行业里经常说"code is law"，这让我想到文学里的textual authority问题。有时候一个smart contract的bug就像诗歌里的一个typo，可能会完全改变meaning 🧐
[B]: What a brilliant parallel you've drawn! It makes me think of the famous case where a misplaced comma in a 19th century edition of Keats' poetry altered generations of interpretation. In our digital age, your 'code is law' principle presents a rather modernist dilemma - the tension between authorial intent and reader (or user) interpretation. Though I wonder, does the immutable nature of blockchain allow for the same kind of hermeneutic flexibility we cherish in literary criticism?
[A]: Good question！其实这正是为什么我们最近在explore upgradable smart contracts的设计。就像literary criticism会evolve over time，我们的code也需要一定的flexibility。不过要balance好immutability和upgradability，就像编辑classic texts时要尊重original intent一样需要谨慎 🔍
[B]: Precisely! You're touching upon what we in comparative literature call the 'horizon of expectations' - how each generation reinterprets texts within their contemporary framework. Your upgradable contracts remind me of annotated editions where scholars add layers of commentary while preserving the original text. Though I must say, watching tech innovators grapple with these philological dilemmas makes me wish more of my literature students would consider coding as a form of modern textual scholarship.
[A]: 哈哈，那下次你可以告诉你的students：learning Solidity其实就像studying ancient Greek - 都是decoding a complex language with precise rules！说不定能吸引更多humanities背景的人进入Web3领域呢 🚀 我们行业真的很需要这种cross-disciplinary thinking
[B]: What a delightful pedagogical proposition! You've just given me an idea for next semester's syllabus - perhaps a special seminar titled 'From Homer to Hash Functions: Literary Approaches to Cryptographic Narratives.' Though I suspect my department chair might raise an eyebrow at such curricular innovation. Still, as Robert Frost wrote, 'Two roads diverged in a wood...' and interdisciplinary paths often lead to the most interesting destinations, don't they?
[A]: Absolutely！而且你知道最ironic的是什么吗？我们blockchain行业现在最火的trend就是"on-chain narratives" - 基本上就是把storytelling和tech结合起来。说不定你的seminar会成为未来Web3 education的blueprint呢 😉 要不下次我来当guest speaker？
[B]: My dear colleague, you've just described what might be the most exciting synthesis of our disciplines since the invention of the printing press! Your offer is most gracious - why, we could examine smart contract narratives through the lens of Barthes' 'Death of the Author' while maintaining practical workshops. Though I should warn you, my students might surprise us both by demanding to analyze Shakespearean sonnets as if they were cryptographic puzzles. The mind fairly reels at the possibilities!
[A]: Haha 那我们就来个"To code or not to code"的特别session！说真的，把Hamlet的soliloquy和smart contract的conditional logic放在一起分析，可能会产生一些mind-blowing的insights呢 🤯 不过我得提醒你，我的literary analysis skills可能还停留在high school level哦~
[B]: Nonsense, my friend! Your blockchain perspective is precisely what would give fresh vitality to our dusty old texts. Why, Hamlet's existential dilemmas could be wonderfully illuminated through decision trees and boolean logic - 'if (ghost.isHonest) { revenge.execute } else { suicide.contemplate }' ... Oh dear, I do believe I'm getting carried away. But what thrilling new hermeneutic horizons you've opened for us today!
[A]: 哈哈，你这pseudo-code版本的Hamlet简直可以拿去ETH Global参赛了！说不定能拿个"Most Literary Smart Contract"奖呢 😂 不过seriously，这种跨界交流真的让我看到了很多new possibilities。下次我带我的team来你们seminar做field trip如何？
[B]: What a splendid proposal! My seminar room may smell faintly of old books and Earl Grey, but I promise we'll roll out the metaphorical red carpet for your tech team. Who knows - between your coders and my literature students, we might birth the first truly poetic smart contract. Though I should warn you, our discussions tend to run over time... the last debate about Milton's Satan as the original decentralized autonomous organization lasted well into teatime!
[A]: 那我们干脆把session安排在下午茶时间吧！可以一边debate DAO governance一边吃scones 🍵 说真的，你们humanities的perspective对我们engineering minds来说就像fresh air一样refreshing。Looking forward to this crazy collab！
[B]: Capital idea! We shall christen it 'High Tea with Hash Functions' - where crumpets meet cryptography and sonnets mingle with Solidity. My faculty lounge will never be the same again, and frankly, it's high time those stuffy portraits of dead poets witnessed something truly innovative. Until then, I'll be brushing up on my coding metaphors... and perhaps hiding the more fragile first editions!
[A]: Haha deal！我会让team准备些blockchain memes作为icebreaker，保证让那些dead poets在portraits里笑出声来 😆 那就下个月见啦~ 记得提醒你的students：这次不用带textbooks，带laptops就行！
[B]: Marvelous! Though I can't promise my students won't sneak in their dog-eared copies of 'Ulysses' - old habits die hard, you know. We'll meet at the intersection of iambic pentameter and IPFS, where literary canon and cryptographic consensus collide. Until then, I'll be practicing my best 'Hello World' in anticipation of this grand interdisciplinary experiment!
