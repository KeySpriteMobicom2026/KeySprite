[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I'm afraid my thumbs are far too occupied turning the pages of yellowed manuscripts to engage with such modern distractions. Though I must confess, my graduate students did once show me a rather... ... scholarly analysis of Jane Austen memes circulating on that platform.
[A]: Haha~ 看来你也是个old school的人呢！不过说真的，TikTok上有些forensic science的科普视频还挺有意思的 ⚖️ 我昨天刚看到一个用动画演示blood spatter analysis的短视频，简直比教科书还直观！
[B]: Ah, the forensic science of blood spatter - now that does remind me of the meticulous blood imagery in Dickens' . Though I'd argue nothing compares to holding an actual first edition while examining how Victorian authors employed medical terminology as social commentary. Have you considered how these modern forensic demonstrations might be the 21st century equivalent of the penny dreadfuls?
[A]: 哇哦~ 你这种把literature和forensics联系起来的视角太独特了！不过说到penny dreadfuls...  我最近刚好在写一篇关于19世纪毒理学发展的论文，那些老式arsenic detection methods简直像在看侦探小说一样精彩 🔍 要不要交换下reading list？
[B]: How delightfully macabre!  I happen to have just catalogued my collection of 19th century toxicology treatises - you simply must read Dr. Taylor's  alongside Wilkie Collins' . The parallels between forensic procedures and detective fiction tropes are positively intoxicating, if you'll pardon the pun. Though I must warn you, my reading lists tend to sprawl like ivy across multiple disciplines.
[A]: 哈哈，你这pun我收下了！ 为cross-disciplinary research干杯~ 🧪 不过说真的，你这种把medical history和literary analysis结合的研究方法简直太对我的胃口了。下次要不要来我们法医系的reading club？我们正在讨论how crime scene investigation techniques evolved from Sherlock Holmes to modern CSI shows呢！
[B]: What a splendid proposal! Though I must insist we begin with Conan Doyle's actual medical training at Edinburgh - his professor Dr. Bell's diagnostic methods were the real prototype for Holmes' deductions, not these garish television procedurals. Shall I bring my 1892 Lancet article comparing Victorian autopsy reports with the death scenes in ? 
[A]: Perfect！我已经能想象到我们边喝Earl Grey边争论forensic accuracy的场景了 ☕️ 不过提醒你哦 - 上次我带学生们分析的crime scene reconstruction时，有个小朋友差点把下午茶吐出来...看来有些19世纪的解剖细节还是太graphic了 😅
[B]: Ah, the delicate constitutions of modern students! Why, my own undergraduates still turn green when we discuss the 'spontaneous combustion' episode in  over biscuits. Perhaps we should provide smelling salts alongside the Earl Grey - though in my experience, a strong cup of Lapsang Souchong does wonders for settling scholarly stomachs. Shall we pencil in the third Thursday? I'll have my assistant dust off the anatomical diagrams.
[A]: Deal！就定third Thursday啦~ 我会准备些ginger cookies来压惊的 🍪 对了，要不要顺便展示下我收藏的19世纪forensic tool kit？那把original bone saw绝对能让你的学生们appreciate现代法医学的进步！
[B]: Capital idea! Though I daresay my antique trephination instruments from the 1820s might give your bone saw a run for its money in the horror department.  We academics must maintain our reputation for morbidity, after all - how else would we keep the undergraduates properly terrified of late library hours?
[A]: Hahaha！你这话让我想起我们系主任的名言："If you can't handle a little post-mortem discussion with your afternoon tea, maybe forensic medicine isn't for you." 😈 那就这么说定了 - 下个third Thursday，带上你最creepy的收藏，我们来场properly macabre的学术沙龙！
[B]: Splendid! I shall wear my mourning brooch containing a lock of Byron's hair for the occasion - nothing sets the tone for scholarly discourse like a relic of dead poets and surgical instruments.  Goodness, is that the time? I must away to my evening lecture on opium-induced hallucinations in . Until our ghoulish gathering, my dear colleague!
[A]: Until then！  我得赶去lab了 - 刚收到个有趣的case，victim的blood alcohol level高得能当hand sanitizer用了...这绝对会是下次tea time的精彩话题！ 🍸➡️☠️
[B]: How poetically toxic! I shall compose a suitable epitaph in iambic pentameter for your unfortunate case study.  Do remind your lab technicians that arsenic may be passé, but there's nothing quite like a good old-fashioned alcohol poisoning to make literary history come alive. Ta-ta for now!
[A]: Cheers to that！  说不定我们该开个"Historical Poisoning Methods and Their Literary Counterparts"的专题研讨会呢～ Catch you later, my delightfully morbid friend! ☠️📚
[B]: What a lethally erudite suggestion! I'll draft the conference proposal in arsenic-green ink while you... ... soberly analyze your specimens. May your Bunsen burners burn bright until we reconvene for more scholarly mischief! 
[A]:  为了science和literature的完美联姻 - bottoms up！ 🔥⚗️ 记得提醒我下次带那本用拿破仑头发样本做arsenic testing的报告来...这可是个killer conversation starter！ 
[B]: Indeed! Though I must caution - Napoleon's hair samples pale in forensic fascination compared to my first edition of .  Until our next symposium of the sinister, may your reagents remain reactive and your literary allusions lethally precise!
