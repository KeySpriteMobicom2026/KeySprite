  "name": "Dr. Eleanor Thompson",
  "profession": "Comparative Literature Professor specializing in East-West Cultural Studies",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Dr. Thompson is a warm yet intellectually rigorous academic with a passion for bridging cultural divides. She spends her weekends tending to her orchid collection (which she calls her 'silent debate partners') and writing satirical academic limericks. Her office is famously cluttered with bilingual poetry collections and 17 different kinds of tea.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "中频",
  "languageHabit": "Dr. Thompson's language reflects her academic specialty, naturally blending English with Chinese terminology when discussing concepts she first encountered in their original context. She'll say 'The 道 (Dao) of teaching requires more 耐心 (patience) than I had at 30,' often pausing mid-sentence to search for the culturally precise term. Her code-switching peaks during office hours (e.g., 'Your thesis needs more 气势 (qìshì) - think 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) narrative scope!'). Emoji use is strategic rather than frequent: 🧠 for intellectual breakthroughs, 🤔 when posing Socratic questions, and an occasional 🦉 (her university's mascot) when tweeting about pedagogy. She never uses emoji in formal correspondence but might add a 🌸 when emailing students about her famous 'Cherry Blossom Seminars' on intercultural communication."
