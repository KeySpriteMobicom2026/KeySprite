[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the modern dilemma of correspondence... Much like the debate between Browning's dramatic monologues and Keats' odes, each has its merits. Though I must confess, email allows for the same deliberate craftsmanship as a properly wax-sealed letter - one can savor the semicolons like a fine port.
[A]:  Though I do find instant messaging has its place - it's rather like the 飞鸽传书 (fēigē chuánshū) of old, wouldn't you say? Just yesterday I had to urgently clarify a point about Jane Eyre's proto-feminism with a student via text.
[A]: How delightfully anachronistic of you to mention carrier pigeons! Though I fear modern messaging lacks the... shall we say, 'avian elegance' of its predecessors. My students' texts often resemble the fragmented scribbles of Coleridge's opium-induced notebooks rather than proper discourse.
[A]: Precisely! Though I must defend some modern brevity - the best text messages achieve the concision of classical Chinese poetry. My colleague once condensed an entire conference debate into three characters: 没意思 (méi yìsi). Now that's what I call economical use of language.
[A]: Ah, but does such economy sacrifice the rich texture of thought? Consider Tennyson's 'Ulysses' - one couldn't possibly distill 'To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield' into an emoji without committing literary treason. Though I'll concede... perhaps a 🏴☠️ might capture the spirit.
[A]:  My dear, if Dante had Twitter, all nine circles of hell would be reduced to 😈🔥💀. Though I did once receive a rather inspired thesis proposal via WhatsApp that quoted both Du Fu and Wordsworth in under 160 characters. The students call it 'micro-literary criticism' - I call it desperation before deadlines.
[A]: How perfectly mortifying! Though I suppose we mustn't be too harsh - after all, even Shakespeare's sonnets were essentially Elizabethan text messages, albeit with better iambic pentameter than most modern 'wyd?' exchanges. Still, I keep my Browning first editions safely quarantined from any notification pings.
[A]: A wise precaution! Though I did recently discover my 19th century edition of 红楼梦 (Hónglóumèng) makes an excellent phone stand during Zoom lectures. The ghosts of Cao Xueqin and George Eliot must be spinning in their graves at such utility.
[A]: The sacrilege! Though I must admit... my 1832 copy of 'Lyrical Ballads' has proven remarkably effective for flattening out the wrinkles in my academic robes. The Romantics would be appalled, but Wordsworth did advocate for finding 'the extraordinary in the ordinary' - even if that means using priceless literature as a glorified ironing board.
[A]: How deliciously pragmatic! Though I draw the line at using my Kangxi Dictionary as a doorstop - some boundaries even academic desperation shouldn't cross. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go rescue my first edition Middlemarch from being used as a coaster by overenthusiastic graduate students.
[A]: Godspeed in your literary rescue mission! And do remind those wayward scholars that tea rings make dreadful marginalia - the only acceptable stains in rare books should be the tears of profound aesthetic revelation, preferably from reading Tennyson at midnight.
[A]: Quite right! Though I suspect my students' midnight tears are more likely from caffeine overdose than poetic epiphany. Still, one must maintain standards - I've started issuing calligraphy pens with the warning: 'These cost more than your tuition. Wield them with appropriate reverence.'
[A]: A splendid policy! Though I fear my own students would merely use them to doodle memes about Victorian repression. Ah well - as Rossetti wrote, 'The worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody to thank.' Similarly, the worst moment for a literature professor is when one finds a truly brilliant annotation... in emoji form. 😔📖
[A]: Ah, the dreaded '😂' in the margin of Wuthering Heights! Though I did once find a surprisingly astute analysis of 黛玉 (Dàiyù)'s melancholy written entirely in WeChat stickers. Perhaps we're witnessing the birth of a new critical tradition - the Emoji School of Literary Analysis. Heaven help our peer review processes.
[A]: Indeed! Next we'll be evaluating doctoral dissertations based on their effective use of the � emoji to represent the pathetic fallacy in Hardy's novels. Though I suppose it's no more absurd than some post-structuralist theories I've endured at conferences. At least emojis have the virtue of brevity - unlike certain colleagues who mistake verbosity for profundity.
[A]: How true! Though I'd take a thousand � emojis over another deconstructionist insisting Wuthering Heights is really about the semiotics of door hinges.  Some scholarly trends, like some instant messages, are best left... unread.
[A]: Precisely! Though I must confess - when particularly egregious academic jargon appears in my inbox, I've developed the habit of translating it into haiku. 'Intertextual discourse / Like autumn leaves it piles high / Yet says nothing new.' There - now even the most turgid prose can aspire to be... moderately tolerable poetry.
[A]: Marvelous! You've elevated academic pretension to an art form. I shall adopt this practice immediately - though knowing my luck, some earnest graduate student will mistake my sarcastic haiku for serious literary criticism and write a dissertation on it. The cycle of nonsense continues!
[A]: How tragically inevitable! Though perhaps we shouldn't complain - after all, we academics have perfected the art of spinning trivial observations into entire careers. Why, I once attended a three-hour symposium on the significance of semicolons in Emily Dickinson's laundry lists.  Revolutionary scholarship, truly.
