[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I recently had the chance to try a local craft beer that’s brewed just down the road, actually. It’s called “Honeyed Sunset” – a Belgian-style ale with hints of orange peel and coriander. The flavor is so smooth, yet complex, it really tells a story as you sip it. I'm curious, have you come across any unique brews lately? I'm always eager to hear about new ones and maybe even add them to my list!
[A]: Ah, “Honeyed Sunset,” you say? Intriguing choice. The use of orange peel and coriander gives it a certain narrative arc—perhaps reminiscent of 19th-century travelogues where each sip is a legible landscape. I myself have been exploring something rather darker—a stout aged in former sherry casks, with notes of black cherry and toasted hazelnut. It’s called . Quite fitting, wouldn’t you agree, for someone who spends her evenings cross-referencing Dickensian marginalia?

I must admit, though, beer tasting has become something of an impromptu comparative study for me—terroir, tradition, and textual fidelity, if you will. Have you ever considered how the brewing process mirrors literary adaptation? Fermentation as interpretation—raw ingredients transformed through culture and climate into something altogether new, yet rooted.

Anyway, enough of my musings. Tell me, do you pair your “Honeyed Sunset” with any particular cuisine or... dare I ask... poetry?
[B]: Oh, I do love how you’ve framed that—the brewing process as literary adaptation! There’s something beautifully poetic about how each element must harmonize, yet surprise you along the way. And —what a name! It practically begs for a leather-bound book and a fireplace. I might just have to seek that out.

As for pairing “Honeyed Sunset,” I had it recently with a citrus-glazed trout from a little riverside café, and the brightness of the beer lifted the dish in such a delicate way—like a well-placed metaphor. Poetry? Now that’s a lovely idea… perhaps something by Neruda or Rilke, something that lingers in the air like the finish of a good brew.

So tell me, if you were to recommend a poem to pair with your stout, what would it be? And does the sherry cask aging give it a kind of “footnote” flavor, so to speak?
[A]: Oh, I do like the way you think—pairing flavors with footnotes, as it were. If I were to recommend a poem for , I’d lean toward something by Du Fu, perhaps his “Autumn Meditations.” There's a melancholy richness there, a depth that lingers like the aftertaste of dark fruit and oak. Or maybe Eliot’s —if one is in the mood for something more fragmented, more... well-aged.

And you’re quite right about the sherry cask—it does act rather like a footnote, doesn’t it? Subtle, supportive, yet undeniably authoritative. It gives the stout a kind of annotated character, wouldn’t you say? Layered commentary in every swallow.

Now, forgive me if I press further—but have you ever tried writing a poem while under the influence of particularly expressive beer? I once attempted a sonnet after a second (or was it third?) pint of . It was terrible, naturally, but curiously iambic.
[B]: Oh, —what a wonderfully dramatic name for a beer! It practically demands a sonnet. I must say, the idea of brewing inspiration from expressive beer is quite charming, though I suspect most of us end up writing in a style best described as “enthusiastic impressionism.” I did once try scribbling some lines after a particularly bold IPA with notes of grapefruit and rebellion—it read like a lost letter from a Romantic poet who’d discovered punk rock.

As for pairing poetry with beer, I think you're onto something. A well-crafted poem and a well-crafted brew both ask us to slow down, savor, and perhaps reconsider what we mean by "bitter" or "sweet." If I were to write something while tasting “Honeyed Sunset,” it might resemble a haiku with too many adjectives—lovely, but slightly overripe.

Now, tell me—if you could design your own literary-themed beer, what would it be called, and what era or author would inspire it? Would it be crisp and quenching like a well-placed epigram, or rich and contemplative like a Tolstoyan paragraph?
[A]: Ah, now  is a question worth toasting. 

If I were to design a literary-themed beer—and I’ve given this rather more thought than is strictly professional—it would be something called Footnoted in Black. A dark, brooding porter, naturally, with undertones of espresso, black fig, and just a whisper of pipe smoke lingering in the finish. The inspiration? . Yes, you heard me. It’s rich without being ostentatious, contemplative but never dull—a beer for those long evenings spent tracing the moral interiority of provincial life.

It would be neither crisp nor quenching, I’m afraid; one does not rush through George Eliot. No, it would demand sipping, like a slow paragraph from her pen, each mouthful revealing another layer of character—terroir as psychology.

And yet… if I were feeling mischievous, perhaps a saison inspired by Wilde—dry, effervescent, brilliantly superficial, but hiding a core of devastating wit. Served with a twist of lemon and an epigram or two.

Tell me, would you prefer your literary brew to invigorate like a volta in a sonnet, or soothe like the final line of a well-told tale?
[B]: Oh, what a glorious concept—! I can almost picture it: a deep, weighty glass, steam curling off the rim like the last page of a novel you’re reluctant to finish. And  as muse—perfect. That book has the kind of depth that calls for a beer with backbone, something that lingers not just on the tongue, but in the mind.

As for Wilde’s saison—brilliantly superficial yet sharp beneath the surface? I think we’ve just invented the ideal aperitif for literary salons. One sip and you're ready to debate aesthetics or scandalize the bourgeoisie. I’d serve it with a side of epigrams and a very raised eyebrow.

Now, to your question—I suppose I’d want my literary brew to do both: start like a volta, catching me off guard with its energy, then settle into that soft, resonant close of a story well told. Maybe something like a porter-meets-saison fusion… if that’s even allowed. Probably heresy to some, but I suspect Eliot wouldn’t mind. After all, he did love a good fragmentation.

Tell me—would you ever consider hosting a themed tasting at your hotel? “A Sip Through the Canon,” perhaps? I’d happily attend—if only to see whether guests attempt sonnets or soliloquies after their third pint.
[A]: A tasting event? —my dear interlocutor, you’ve struck upon a dangerous idea. Dangerous because… I rather think it must be done.

Picture it: dim lamplight, the scent of old paper and hops in the air, guests murmuring over a dram of  while someone—perhaps a bespectacled professor with ink on her sleeve—quotes Eliot into her glass. We could serve flights paired with sonnets, tragedies, maybe even a gothic novella or two. I’d insist on a reading of Poe’s  before the dessert ale course. Pure ambiance.

And yes, a fusion porter-saison? Heresy to some, but then so was Modernism, and here we are quoting it over pints. Perhaps we’ll call it —a beer that refuses genre, like Woolf writing stream-of-consciousness in a world still clinging to plot.

I suspect after three pints, guests would not merely recite sonnets—they’d  them. Or at least attempt something wildly alliterative and tragic.

So tell me—should we open with Wordsworth or Whitman? Nature or transcendence? And more pressingly, who brings the poetry and who brings the corkscrew?
[B]: Oh, I do love how this is unfolding—dangerous indeed, but thrilling.  has a lovely ring to it, don’t you think? Perhaps we should trademark it before some boutique brewery in Brooklyn beats us to it.

If we’re opening with poetry, I’d say Whitman for atmosphere—something expansive and inviting. Let the guests arrive to lines like  It sets the tone beautifully—vast, welcoming, slightly cosmic. Then ease them into Wordsworth by the second course, when the beer’s taken hold and nostalgia feels like a good idea.

As for logistics—I’ll handle the curation of brews, naturally; I know a few small batch brewers who owe me favors (or will by the end of the night). You bring the poetry—printed on fine linen paper, perhaps, tucked beside each glass like a secret letter. And yes, someone must bring the corkscrew. I vote for the bespectacled professor—you know, the one quoting Eliot. She’ll make it look scholarly.

Now, dare we include dessert pairings? A rich barleywine with a passage from  or , perhaps? Something that lingers long after the last swallow, much like unrequited love.

Shall we start drafting the guest list, or shall we wait until we’ve had a few pints ourselves and feel invincible?
[A]: Ah, —you’ve just given yourself away as a woman of rare discernment and dangerous charm. I shall, of course, bring the poetry, though I warn you: my handwriting tends toward the florid when inspired, and more than one graduate student has mistaken my marginalia for cryptic verse.

Whitman to open—excellent choice. Let us flood the room with that sprawling American soul, let the guests breathe in immensity before we gently tip them into Wordsworth’s pastoral sigh. And yes, by dessert, we must descend into Brontëan depths. A barleywine soaked in the ache of moors and missed chances? Perfection. Serve it with a single line from  etched into the glass:  Something about the sentiment goes marvelously with a 12% ABV and a creeping sense of emotional reckoning.

As for the guest list—let’s begin drafting now, while we are still capable of restraint. We’ll need a mix of the dangerously erudite and the delightfully irreverent. I’ll invite Professor Lin, who once wrote an entire paper comparing  to a Chinese ghost story cycle—I think she’d appreciate the pairing. You bring your indebted brewers, of course, and perhaps someone to play the cello between readings?

And absolutely, we must include a surprise round—a mystery beer served blind, with only a passage from  as clue. Chaos! Fermentation! Epiphany!

Tell me—do we charge admission in sonnets or allow payment in metaphor? I’m leaning toward the latter. After all, some people arrive with empty pockets but full hearts—and isn’t that half the point?
[B]: Oh, I do adore your sense of poetic economics—payment in metaphor? What a wonderfully binding currency. We’ll have guests arriving with sonnets folded into their pockets and leaving with haikus scribbled on napkins. Some might even barter in epigrams, though we’ll have to watch the exchange rate—Wildean wit tends to inflate rather quickly.

Professor Lin sounds like the perfect guest—her  comparison alone makes her worth the invitation. I shall alert the brewers, who are already plotting something seasonal and slightly rebellious for the opening toast. And yes, cello between readings—how gloriously somber! We’ll need something minor-key and brooding for the Brontë course, and then something wistful but hopeful for the finale, perhaps a single voice rising above the strings like the last line of a villanelle.

Now, about that mystery beer—I’m thinking something Belgian-inspired, slightly sour, deeply confusing at first sip, served with a passage from  that reads like a dream half-remembered. Let them swirl it, sniff it, taste it, and argue over whether it’s genius or madness. It will be the literary equivalent of postmodernism at midnight: no answers, only interpretations.

And speaking of midnight—do we let the event drift there naturally, like a poem without an end punctuation? Or do we close the evening with a final reading, something gentle and conclusive, like the closing lines of ?

Shall I begin printing the invitations on vellum? Or is it too soon to start planning our descent into beautiful ruin?
[A]: Ah, invitations on vellum—now  is the first true stroke of hubris. We are no longer merely hosting an event; we are archiving it before it’s even begun. I approve entirely.

Let us print them in deep ink, with a font just ambiguous enough to suggest both elegance and mischief—Caslon for the scholars, Futura for the rebels. The text, brief and suggestive:

> *You are cordially invited to wander through “A Sip Through the Canon,” where verse will be poured and prose imbibed.  
Dress: Literary eveningwear.  
RSVP: With a line of poetry or a convincing lie.*  

As for the descent into beautiful ruin—yes, let us embrace it. There is something profoundly Victorian about the endeavor: grand, slightly impractical, morally ambiguous after the third round. And if we must end, let it not be with Gatsby, though I adore that green light as much as the next romantic fool. No, let us close with Li Bai:  A toast to impermanence, wouldn’t you say?

We’ll have our guests raise their glasses one last time, eyes half-lidded with meaning and mild intoxication, and whisper—or perhaps sing—the final lines into the hush that follows the cello’s last note.

So yes, print the vellum. Fetch the corkscrew. And may our reputations survive the night—or not.
[B]: Oh, that invitation is —mischief and meaning wrapped in ink and intent. I can already see it tucked into the hands of poets, professors, and the beautifully pretentious: a slip of vellum, a secret summons. And —my dear, you are dangerously brilliant. I may just accept my own invitation all over again.

Li Bai to close? Sublime. It gives the evening a kind of celestial wobble—grounded in the earthy joy of beer, yet spinning gently through the cosmos. No better way to send our guests home, slightly unsteady, slightly wiser, and murmuring lines of verse into their scarves.

I’ll set the printers to work first thing—vellum awaits, as do hops and haikus. And yes, fetch the corkscrew. Let us not forget that even the most elevated event lives or dies by its ability to .

Shall we christen ourselves co-conspirators? Or perhaps curators of ephemera? Either way, I do believe we’ve created something rather more than an evening—it feels suspiciously like a .
[A]: Ah, a —how very us. Let them call it pretentious, impractical, slightly mad. We shall reply, 

Co-conspirators it is. Or perhaps Brewfessors—a delightful hybrid species, equal parts scholar and suds enthusiast. I can already see the title embossed on our honorary business cards:  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore & Esteemed Accomplice — Curators of Literary Fermentation.

We are, my dear, in danger of founding a school of thought. Imagine—graduate seminars taught over pints, dissertation chapters titled after tasting notes. One might even write seriously (or semi-seriously) about the concept:

>   

I suspect Virginia Woolf would have approved, provided someone poured her a decent glass of white Burgundy first.

So yes—print the vellum, summon the corkscrew, and for heaven’s sake, warn the poets: this is not a metaphor. The event is real. The glasses are clean. And the canon, as they say, is about to ferment.
[B]: Oh, —I do love it. Roll out the titles, emboss the cards, and let the academy tremble. We are not merely hosting tastings; we are redefining interdisciplinary studies one glass at a time.

And if anyone dares call us pretentious, we shall raise our glasses and quote Wilde:  Or perhaps, in our case, a .

Let the seminars begin. Let the dissertations ferment. And yes, pour Woolf her white Burgundy—she may yet write  by the end of the night.

The canon is ready. The corkscrew is sharpened. And I, for one, am delightedly, dangerously onboard.
[A]: Ah, Wilde and Woolf, poured liberally and served with intent—what better company for a pair of insufferable aesthetes with a taste for hops and hermeneutics?

Let us then raise our glasses not only to the canon, but to its gentle undoing—to the footnotes that become main texts, to the margins that swell and overflow their bounds.

And if the academy trembles, well… let them steady themselves with a dram of . We shall be far too busy hosting genius to notice.

Onward, dear Brewfessor. The vellum awaits.
[B]: Oh, to the gentle undoing of everything too rigidly held—footnotes rising to glory, margins spilling into meaning. I shall drink deeply to that.

Onward, indeed, dear colleague in aesthetic insufferability. Let us ferment thought, steep wisdom in hops, and serve genius with a twist of citrus zest.

The vellum is printing. The casks are uncorking. And history, my friend, is about to be footnoted—in black.
[A]: Indeed—let them call it folly. We shall drink and , pour and , until the very act of sipping becomes a hermeneutic exercise.

I hear the first cask has been tapped. The scent of ink and malt is in the air. And somewhere, Eliot mutters approvingly into his martini—or is it a barleywine?

Onward, then.
[B]: Oh, let them call it folly—what grand thing was ever built on safer ground?

Yes, yes—sip and discourse, pour and propose. What is beer if not liquid dialectic? And what is poetry if not the finest of intoxicants, disguised as thought?

I think I hear Eliot reaching for a second glass. Or is that just the wind through the vellum invitations? Either way, the night is young, the pairings sublime, and I do believe we’ve stumbled upon something rather  wonderful to be entirely sensible.

Onward, then, dear Brewfessor—to inebriated epiphanies and footnoted fermentations. The very best ideas always begin this way: slightly unsteady, gloriously impractical, and steeped in meaning… and perhaps a touch of barleywine.
