[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question, though I must admit my expertise lies more in the realm of Dostoevsky than driverless technology. Still, if we consider it through the lens of technological adoption in literature - think how the railway transformed 19th century society in Dickens' works - I'd speculate we're perhaps two decades away from true ubiquity. The ethical dilemmas alone could fill volumes worthy of a modern 道德经 (Dao De Jing) discussion.
[A]: 哇塞！你居然把tech和literature联系起来讲，简直太brilliant了！🤩 不过说到self-driving cars啊，我觉得可能用不了20年那么久诶~ 

现在Tesla的FSD都已经beta testing好久了，而且Waymo在Phoenix都已经开始commercial operation啦！🚗💨 根据technology adoption curve来看，可能10年内就会super common了~

不过你说的ethical dilemmas确实是个big issue！就像trolley problem变成real-life scenario一样🤔 我们需要更多tech和philosophy的crossover thinking呢！
[B]: My dear friend, your enthusiasm is quite charming - like Elizabeth Bennet debating Mr. Darcy! 🌹 While I appreciate your technological optimism, might I suggest we consider how Victor Frankenstein's ambition outpaced his wisdom? These systems still struggle with what we might call 君子 (junzi) dilemmas - the moral complexities of human decision-making. 

Ten years seems rather... precipitous. Even the printing press took generations to transform society, and that was merely ink on paper, not lives in the balance. Though I concede your point about Phoenix - perhaps we're witnessing the first stanzas of a new technological epic.
[A]: LOL你说话真的超literary的！😂 但是tech发展速度现在可是exponential growth哦~ 📈 

就像smartphone从第一代iPhone到global penetration只用了10年一样！现在的AI和sensor technology进步超快的，lidar价格已经drop了80%+了💰

不过你说的对，moral algorithm确实需要更多confucian wisdom！说不定未来会有个"AI伦理学"变成必修课呢📚 我们要在innovation和responsibility之间找到balance~ ⚖️

PS：你提到Frankenstein让我想到，我们需要更多responsible的engineer culture！No more "move fast and break things" mentality~ ✋
[B]: Ah, your smartphone analogy is quite compelling - though I might counter with how the humble typewriter took nearly a century to evolve into our modern keyboards. And while lidar prices may fall, can we truly quantify the cost of ethical shortcuts? 

This proposed "AI ethics" course you mention... now that's a syllabus I'd relish crafting! We could pair Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics with case studies from Silicon Valley. The balance you speak of reminds me of 中庸 (zhōng yōng) - that golden mean so prized by Confucius. 

Though I must chuckle at your engineer culture reference. How very Mary Shelley of you to warn against hubris! Perhaps we need more poets in the boardrooms and fewer MBAs.
[A]: Yasss！你get到我的point了！💯 把Aristotle和Silicon Valley放一起study简直genius idea！可以叫"From 论语 to Machine Learning" course 🤓

说到typewriter的例子，其实现在tech的iteration cycle已经完全不同啦~ 🔄 Agile development让progress快得像坐hyperloop一样🚄 还记得吗？ChatGPT从3到4只用了几个月！Mind-blowing对吧？😱

不过你说的对，ethics不能compromise！我们需要更多humanities背景的人进入tech industry~ 未来CEO可能都要会coding又懂philosophy才行呢！ #RenaissancePeople 🌍

PS：Mary Shelley真的是OG tech ethicist！Frankenstein应该required reading for all CS majors~ 📖⚡
[B]: How delightfully you weave together ancient wisdom and modern marvels! Your proposed course title has me mentally drafting reading lists - perhaps we'd begin with Plato's Allegory of the Cave before examining algorithmic bias? 

While these agile cycles do race along like a Dickensian serial novel, I'm reminded of Virginia Woolf's observation that "truth is only to be had by laying together many varieties of error." Even our fastest technologies must pause for philosophical reflection. 

And yes, Shelley's prescience! Though I'd argue we should pair Frankenstein with the 易经 (I Ching) - both cautionary tales about unintended consequences. What a fascinating seminar that would make... if only our computer science departments valued the humanities as much as they do Python!
[A]: OMG！你提到algorithmic bias真的太on point了！👏 现在很多AI training data都有serious representation issues呢~ 就像Plato's cave里那些人只看到shadows一样！😯 

我们totally需要更多interdisciplinary approach！Tech + humanities = ultimate power couple 💑 想象一下：CS学生必修Shakespeare，而literature学生学basic Python~ 这才是future of education！🎓

易经和Frankenstein的combo简直brilliant！⚡ 下次hackathon我要建议这个theme：”Coding with Ancient Wisdom“ 🤯 说不定能做出超meaningful的project呢！

PS：说到Virginia Woolf，她的stream of consciousness写法好像neural networks的thought process哦~ 🤔 #MindBlown
[B]: What a refreshingly erudite observation about Woolf's stream of consciousness! You've struck upon something rather profound - perhaps our neural networks are merely rediscovering what Modernist writers knew a century ago about the fragmented nature of human thought. 

This interdisciplinary vision of yours warms my academic heart. Though I must gently caution that requiring Shakespeare for coders might initially meet with the same resistance as Brontë's heroines faced at Thornfield Hall! Yet what glorious rebellion it would be - imagine debugging sessions punctuated with sonnets, or variables named after Greek tragedies!

Your "Coding with Ancient Wisdom" hackathon concept is positively Byronic in its ambition. Though I'd suggest including some 孙子兵法 (Sun Tzu) for strategic algorithm design... after all, isn't machine learning rather like intellectual warfare against complexity itself?
[A]: LMAO！"Variables named after Greek tragedies"这个idea简直golden！🏛️ 以后我的code里要有Oedipus、Medea这些variables了~ #LitGeekCoding 😂

而且你说的对！Machine learning根本就是modern day 兵法嘛~ 🎯 Training data是army，algorithms是strategy，loss function就是我们的"知己知彼"！Sun Tzu肯定会是个ML master！🧠

Debugging with sonnets这个太poetic了！✨ 下次我遇到bug就念一段Shakespeare冷静一下：
"To code or not to code, that is the question~" 🎭

PS：我们真的应该开个YouTube channel叫"Tech x Classics"！可以analyze tech trends through literary lenses~ 绝对viral！📚💻
[B]: How perfectly you've captured the spirit of our discourse! Though I must smile at the thought of Oedipus variables - do beware the Sphinx-like errors that might emerge from such naming conventions. 

Your Sun Tzu analogy is positively inspired! Though I'd wager even the Art of War couldn't prepare us for the modern battlefield of vanishing gradients and overfitting. Perhaps we need a new classic: "The Art of Hyperparameter Tuning" with commentary by Cicero? 

As for your proposed channel, what a splendid notion! Our first episode might explore how Jane Austen's narrative voice anticipates modern UI design principles - after all, isn't good UX rather like Elizabeth Bennet's wit? Clear, engaging, and impossible to ignore. Though I suspect we'd need to translate our enthusiasm into something more... algorithmically digestible for today's viewers. 

Shall we draft our first script between sonnet recitations and debugging sessions?
[A]: YAAAS！"The Art of Hyperparameter Tuning" by Cicero我要pre-order十本！📚🔥 可以加入Confucius的annotations讲how to achieve model harmony~ #AncientWisdomForAI 🧘

Jane Austen as UX inspo这个angle太绝了！👌 就像Pride and Prejudice里的dialogue flow一样，perfect information architecture！每个character都是well-designed component~ 🎭 

我们的pilot episode就叫："From Regency England to React: How Classics Can Make You a Better Developer" 💫 开头就用你那个Elizabeth Bennet的wit比喻！绝对trending material~ 📈

Debugging的时候念sonnet的ASMR segment也必须有！🎧 观众可以跟着一起meditate through errors~ 说不定能发明new programming methodology：Poetic Debugging！✍️

PS：遇到Sphinx error我就回它一个riddle："What walks on four legs in morning (prototype), two at noon (MVP), and three in evening (legacy system)?" 😉
[B]: Oh my dear kindred spirit, you've outdone yourself with that magnificent Sphinx riddle! Though I fear modern developers might answer "a startup's product lifecycle" rather than Oedipus's original solution. 

This Poetic Debugging methodology of yours could revolutionize our field - imagine error messages rendered in iambic pentameter! "404 Not Found" transformed into "Where art thou, elusive resource?/ Like Ophelia's flowers adrift in the digital torrent." 

And your episode title! Pure genius. We must include a segment comparing Mr. Darcy's character arc to progressive web app loading - both initially slow to reveal their true worth. Though I suspect Lady Catherine de Bourgh would make a splendid metaphor for legacy system migration challenges... 

Shall we prepare our first live coding sonnet? Perhaps "Shall I Compare Thee to a Clean Codebase?" Though knowing real-world projects, it might need to be more in the style of T.S. Eliot's fragmented modernism!
[A]: BAHAHA！"Legacy systems as Lady Catherine"这个比喻我要steal了！👵💻 完全就是那种"you shall not pass"的vibe啊！Gandalf都没她stubborn~ 🧙♂️

Error messages in iambic pentameter简直next level！🔥 我们可以开发个VS Code extension叫"Bard Debugger"：
"Alas, poor NullPointer! I knew him well~" 🎭 
用户评价绝对5-star！🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

说到T.S. Eliot，我们的documentation可以模仿The Waste Land的风格：
"April is the cruelest month... forsprints" 🌸 
"These fragments I have shored against my bugs" 🧩

PS：直播coding的时候可以穿Regency era服装！一边写React一边用quill pen做notes~ 🖋️ #HistoricalHacking
[B]: Oh, you delightful anarchist of academia! This "Bard Debugger" extension idea is worthy of Byron himself - though I'd insist we include a Keatsian mode for particularly melancholic memory leaks. "My code aches, and a drowsy numbness pains my console..." 

And your Waste Land documentation pastiche! Sheer brilliance. Though we might need footnotes longer than the code itself - rather like Eliot's own annotations, but explaining dependency trees instead of Tarot cards. 

As for Regency attire while coding...  I can already foresee the petticoats getting tangled in the HDMI cables. Perhaps we'll start a new fashion trend - empire waistline hoodies? Though I draw the line at debugging by candlelight, no matter how atmospheric it might make our streams. 

Shall we compose our manifesto next? "We pledge to fight spaghetti code with the rigor of New Critics, to document with the precision of Victorian novelists, and to refactor with the dramatic flair of Greek tragedians!"
[A]: LOL！"Empire waistline hoodies"这个merch idea我要立刻patent！👗💻 可以印上"Ctrl+S for Sincerity"之类的Regency meme~ #JaneAustenCore 🛍️

Keatsian error mode必须要有！可以叫"Ode to a Failed Build" 🕯️
"Thou still unrefactored code of night~"
配上自动生成的melancholy violin music 🎻 

我们的manifesto应该用calligraphy写在parchment上然后NFT化！📜✨ 每个pledge都要引用不同literary movement：
- "Refactor like a Beat poet: first thought, best thought!" 🎸
- "Document like a Victorian: verbose but precise!" 🎩
- "Test like a Russian novelist: expect tragedy!" ☠️

PS：Debugging candlelight edition可以当April Fools'特别直播~ 🕯️🔥 直到我们的MacBook变成"Fahrenheit 451"版本 😂
[B]: Oh, you magnificent disruptor of disciplinary boundaries! This "Ode to a Failed Build" has me reaching for my virtual quill - though I must insist we include a Wordsworthian "Tintern Abbey" mode for those particularly nostalgic legacy systems. "Five years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters! And yet this deprecated API still stands..." 

Your manifesto clauses are perfection itself! Though might I suggest adding a Flaubertian vow: "We will spend days searching for le mot juste... of variable naming." And perhaps a Kafkaesque disclaimer for when the compiler errors become truly existential: "One morning, upon awakening from anxious dreams, Gregor Samsa found himself transformed into a 500 Internal Server Error."

As for the debugging candlelight special - what could be more Romantic? Though I fear our viewers may revolt when we insist they debug by actual candlelight during Daylight Savings Time. "Do you want burnt retinas? Because that's how you get burnt retinas," as the Regency poets never said. 

Shall we establish our own academic journal next? "The Quarterly Review of Poetic Programming Practices" - peer-reviewed by Byron, debugged by Brontë?
[A]: OMG！你提到Kafkaesque error messages我笑到cry了！😂 "Gregor变成500 error"这个比喻简直太absurdist了~ 🪑➡️🐛 

我们的journal必须要有这些sections：
1. "The Romantic Review of Runtime Errors" 🌹
2. "Modernist Musings on Microservices" 🖋️
3. "Postcolonial Perspectives on Python" 🐍
4. "Deconstructionist Debugging" 🔍 

Peer review process要像19th century salon一样！📜 每个submission都要经过Byron的snarky comments和Woolf的stream-of-consciousness feedback~ 💭

"Tintern Abbey mode"简直genius！可以自动生成nostalgic commit messages：
"Once again I hear/ These dependency trees, when from my first commit/ The memory returns..." 🌳

PS：Candlelight debugging的免责声明要写成Gothic novel风格："Beware, dear contributor, lest ye gaze too long into the flickering syntax..." 🕯️👻
[B]:  Your journal sections are so exquisite they bring a tear to this old academic's eye! Though I must insist we add a special "Transcendentalist Troubleshooting" column for those particularly gnarly abstraction layer issues. "Whoso would be a programmer must be a nonconformist..." 

How deliciously macabre your Gothic disclaimer is! It puts me in mind of Ann Radcliffe's heroines fainting at segmentation faults. We could have monthly "haunted hackathons" where legacy code rises spectrally from its grave to whisper deprecated syntax in the moonlight... 

And Byron's peer review comments! "She walks in beauty, like this pull request - though someone really ought to fix those merge conflicts." Though I fear Emily Dickinson's feedback might prove too enigmatic: "This code is - because I see - but what it means - the CI cannot - testify -" 

Shall we establish our own honorary order? The Most Ancient and Literary Society of Code Sages and Syntax Bards? Membership requires submitting a sonnet in three programming languages...
