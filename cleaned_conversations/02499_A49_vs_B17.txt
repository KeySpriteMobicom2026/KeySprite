[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to digital entertainment. While my students often tease me about my flip phone, I find my greatest addiction remains between the pages of well-worn books. Though I did recently discover a delightful app that identifies wildflowers - quite useful for my gardening pursuits.
[A]: Oh my~ 作为一个digital游民，我完全get你的point！📚 不过现在很多mobile game都超级chill的，比如我最近超addicted的'猫咪庭院'，super relaxing的放置类game，就像digital版本的reading break呢！☕️✨ 要不要试试看？
[B]: How charming - the concept of a 'digital reading break' does have a certain appeal. Though I must say, my idea of relaxation still leans more toward Browning's sonnets than virtual feline companions. That being said, your enthusiasm reminds me of how my students describe the meditative quality of pruning roses in my garden. Perhaps there's a parallel there between nurturing pixels and petals?
[A]: Haha totally feel you！🌹 其实gardening和gaming都是很好的mindfulness practice呢~ 我最近在玩一个叫'Viridi'的succulent growing app，完全就是digital gardening experience！🌱 而且还能学到好多plant care的tips，超级therapeutic的~ 要不要exchange一下你的rose pruning心得？✨
[B]: What a fascinating intersection of technology and horticulture! Your 'Viridi' sounds rather like a modernist interpretation of 盆景 (penjing) - the miniature landscapes we cultivate with such care. As for my roses, I've found pruning to be much like editing poetry: one must know precisely where to make the cut to encourage the most beautiful growth. The north-facing varieties particularly thrive when... oh dear, I do tend to wax lyrical about my garden, don't I?
[A]: OMG你的比喻太on point了！✂️ Editing poetry和pruning roses真的超similar的vibes~ 说到这个，我最近在学Japanese的Kokedama，就是把plants做成moss ball的那种art form，完全就是3D版本的poetry嘛！🎋 要不要下次coffee chat的时候我给你看我的plant journal？☕️📓 里面全是各种plant care的sketch和notes，super aesthetic的！
[B]: How delightful! Your plant journal sounds like a modern-day version of Erasmus Darwin's 'The Botanic Garden' - blending art and science with such personal flair. I'd be charmed to see it over tea, though I must warn you, I'll likely quote Wordsworth's 'The Tables Turned' about books versus nature the entire time. Your kokedama pursuits remind me of how Emily Dickinson tended her conservatory - finding the universe in a single blossom. Shall we say Thursday at the little café by the university greenhouse?
[A]: Yasss！Thursday sounds perfect！🌿 我已经可以imagine那个场景了 - 坐在greenhouse旁边的café，一边sip着matcha latte一边聊plants和poetry~ 📖✨ 我会bring我的journal还有新做的kokedama samples！BTW那个café的avocado toast也超级yummy的，要不要make it a brunch date？🥑☕️
[B]: Ah, the avocado toast - nature's free verse on toasted sourdough! How wonderfully contemporary of you to suggest brunch. I shall bring my well-thumbed copy of 'The Language of Flowers' and my pressed rose collection from last season. Though I must insist we avoid discussing that dreadful modern habit of photographing one's food - unless, of course, it's to document the exquisite interplay of green hues between your kokedama and the avocado. Thursday it is, then!
[A]: Hahaha你太funny了！📸 不过说到food photography，我最近发现用VSCO的A6 filter拍plant-based dishes真的超有vintage vibe的~ 而且那个café的natural lighting简直perfect for flat lay shots！🌿 那我们Thursday 10am见？Can't wait to exchange plant tips and poetry lines！✨ PS：记得wear something green哦，这样我们可以match我的kokedama的aesthetic~ 💚
[B]: How wonderfully thematic - coordinating our attire with the chlorophyll palette! I shall don my sage green cardigan that my students claim makes me look like 'a walking sonnet.' Ten o'clock is perfect; early enough to catch the morning light dancing through the greenhouse glass, yet civilized enough that I'll have finished annotating my Milton. And fear not - I promise to restrain myself from reciting 'Ode to a Nightingale' when the barista presents our matcha. Until Thursday, my dear digital horticulturist!
[A]: See you then my poetic plant lover！🌿📚 我已经在calendar上mark了10am with green highlighter了~ 记得check我的IG story哦，我会post我们的kokedama & avocado toast aesthetic collab！✨💚 Until Thursday！☕️🌸
[B]: What a thoroughly modern send-off! I shall attempt to navigate this 'IG story' phenomenon, though you may find my commentary more Keatsian than Instagrammable. Green highlighter - how perfectly symbolic of our cross-pollination of analog and digital worlds. Until our verdant rendezvous, may your succulents thrive and your verses flow as freely as that matcha shall! Ta-ta for now!
[A]: Hahaha你总是能find the most poetic words！🌸 我已经能picture你trying to figure out IG stories的样子了，so adorable！📲✨ Don't worry我会walk you through it over brunch~ 现在gotta run去给我的kokedama做final touch-up了！Thursday见！💚☕️ Keep calm and poetry on！✍️
[B]: What a delightful hybrid of contemporary farewell and timeless wisdom - 'Keep calm and poetry on' might just replace 'Carpe Diem' as my new motto! Run along to your kokedama, my dear, while I practice my most scholarly selfie face. Though I suspect my attempt at 'IG story readiness' will be more Elizabeth Barrett Browning than influencer-chic. Until we meet amidst the avocado and iambic pentameter!
[A]: Hahaha你kill me！😂 Elizabeth Barrett Browning的selfie face绝对会是next big trend！📸✨ 我已经可以imagine你配着sonnet captions的posts了~ 好啦真的gotta jet了，my plants are calling！🌱 See you soon with extra matcha and poetry vibes！💚☕️ Byeeee~
[B]: What a perfectly punctuated departure! Your plants call, my books sigh from their shelves, and somewhere between our digital and analog worlds, poetry blooms eternal. I'll be the one Thursday clutching both a leather-bound anthology and a smartphone with equal bewilderment. Safe travels to you and your kokedama - may they grow as joyfully as our impending conversation promises to! Toodle-pip!
[A]: Aww你总是say the sweetest things！📚💚 现在真的really gotta go了 - my monstera突然开始drooping，emergency plant CPR needed！🌿💦 Can't wait for our Thursday的poetry & plants crossover episode！✨ Byeeee~ 记得practice your best sonnet selfie angles！😉📸
[B]: Oh dear, an ailing monstera - nature's own dramatic monologue unfolding in real time! Rush to your botanical patient, and may your emergency care be as precise as Pope's couplets. I'll be here practicing my 'How Do I Love Thee?' pout for our Thursday debut. Off you go - your green thumb awaits! Pip pip!
