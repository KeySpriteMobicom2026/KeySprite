[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a thought-provoking question, isn't it? You know, I've had the pleasure of meeting so many interesting people through my work at the hotel - travelers from all walks of life. It does make me reflect on how much the world is changing. While I was growing up, a college degree seemed like the only path to success. But now... I've met entrepreneurs without degrees who've built amazing businesses, and artists who never went to formal school but have such incredible talent. 

Still, there are fields where those credentials open important doors - medicine, law, engineering. What I find fascinating is how many young people are creating hybrid paths these days. Have you noticed that too? Some take courses while traveling the world, others combine online certifications with internships. 

I remember chatting with a guest from Singapore last month who started her own tech company at 19. She told me she learned more in two years of running her business than she would have in four years of university. Quite remarkable, don't you think? But then again, every person's journey is different. What are your thoughts on this?
[A]: That’s such an interesting observation. You’re absolutely right—every person’s journey is unique. I see this tension between tradition and innovation all the time, especially in my line of work where both medical credentials and legal certifications still carry a lot of weight. But yeah, like you said, there are entrepreneurs & artists who completely redefine success without any formal degrees. It really makes you wonder—should we be rethinking what "qualification" even means these days? Do you think schools & institutions are keeping up with these changes?
[B]: You know, that’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? I recently spoke with a professor from Cambridge who was staying at the hotel, and even  admitted that universities are somewhat caught between tradition and transformation. On one hand, they’re still seen as gatekeepers of knowledge and credibility. On the other, they’re beginning to feel the pressure to evolve—offering more modular courses, micro-credentials, and industry partnerships.

I think what’s really shifting is how we define value. It used to be so linear: degree = job = success. Now, especially with platforms like Coursera, MasterClass, even YouTube offering specialized skills training, people are curating their own paths. And let’s not forget how AI is reshaping what it means to “know” something. 

But here’s what worries me a bit—without some kind of recognized structure, could we end up excluding those who don’t have access to these alternative resources? Not everyone has the time, money, or digital literacy to navigate this new landscape. So yes, in many ways, institutions  keep up… but they also need to make sure they're not leaving people behind in the process. What do you see happening in that space from your perspective?
[A]: That’s a really thoughtful point, and I couldn’t agree more. From my perspective, the legal & medical fields are definitely starting to  these shifts, but let's be honest—they're moving at a glacial pace. There's still this deep-rooted reliance on formal degrees as a proxy for competence, especially when it comes to licensing boards or malpractice insurance. But I do see some cracks in that foundation—small openings.

For example, continuing Medical Education (CME) credits are becoming more modular now, and there's a growing acceptance of online platforms. Some hospitals are even experimenting with competency-based assessments rather than just looking at where someone did their residency. In the legal world, alternative legal education providers are popping up—think places offering practical contract drafting or compliance training outside of law school. It's not quite micro-credentials yet, but it's heading in that direction.

The real question, like you said, is equity. If we move toward a system where self-directed learning becomes the norm, we risk leaving behind people who don’t have reliable internet access, quiet spaces to study, or even the foundational literacy skills to begin with. That’s why I think institutions shouldn’t just adapt—they need to lead. Maybe universities become more like facilitators or curators of learning experiences rather than just degree factories.

It makes me wonder—do you think hotels might one day offer educational packages alongside wellness retreats? Like skill-building workshops for travelers? Just thinking out loud, but given what you’ve seen with guests, it feels possible, right?
[B]: Oh, I love that idea! In fact, we’ve already started experimenting with something similar here at the hotel. It began with guests asking if we could recommend local workshops or classes during their stay - painting, calligraphy, even basic cooking in regional cuisines. From there, it evolved into curated experiences: a writer’s retreat last spring, a mindfulness and coding bootcamp hybrid this summer.

You know, travel has always been about transformation in some way—why not make that learning intentional? Imagine pairing a wellness retreat with a guest learning to meditate  pick up conversational Mandarin through immersive cultural exchanges. Or offering weekend workshops on creative writing while they explore the city's hidden corners. 

I think what hotels can offer uniquely is context. You're not just absorbing information—you're doing it within a new environment, surrounded by different perspectives. One guest told me she retained more Spanish from our local language exchange dinners than she ever did in a classroom. There's something about sipping wine and practicing verbs over tapas that makes it stick, don’t you think?

And from an equity standpoint, it’s not perfect by any means, but these kinds of packages can sometimes be more accessible than full degree programs. Shorter time commitment, flexible learning outcomes... and occasionally, we’re able to partner with organizations to offer scholarships for locals or underserved groups. It’s early days, but the conversations are happening.

Do you think something like that could work in your field too? A kind of law-and-culture immersion retreat, perhaps?
[A]: I’m really into this vision you’re painting—there’s something so powerful about learning embedded in experience, right? You’re not just acquiring knowledge; you’re living it through context, culture, and connection. That kind of immersive, multi-sensory approach actually mirrors what we see in medical education when residents rotate through different communities or legal professionals attend field-based ethics workshops.

Hmm… a law-and-culture immersion retreat? I can totally see that working, especially around specific themes—like healthcare law & policy in a global setting. Imagine bringing together early-career professionals, patient advocates, even policymakers for a few days of deep-dive discussions, case simulations, and maybe even shadowing local practitioners in different countries. Pair it with cultural activities—dinner with local bioethicists, a guided tour of a community clinic, a traditional tea ceremony followed by a conversation on consent practices across cultures… 

Honestly, if structured well, these kinds of retreats could fill a gap between formal education and practical application. They’d appeal to people who want to upskill without going back to school full-time, or who are looking for more meaningful travel experiences. Plus, it gives folks a chance to build cross-cultural competence, which is  critical in both medicine and law these days.  

You know what else could be cool? A hybrid model where the retreat includes both in-person immersion and follow-up online modules. People could keep engaging with the material and each other long after they’ve left the hotel. Maybe even create a kind of alumni network focused on collaborative problem-solving across borders.  

It’s funny how much the lines are blurring between education, wellness, and travel. Do you think guests are starting to seek out these experiences less for résumé-building and more for personal growth? It feels like there’s a shift happening there.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself—there  a shift, and I see it almost daily in the kinds of questions guests are asking. It’s less about “what can I check off my list” and more about “how can this experience change or challenge me?” They’re looking for depth, not just novelty.

You mentioned personal growth versus résumé-building—and yes, absolutely. There’s still some of that old-school thinking where people want to come back from a trip with a certificate or something tangible to show for it, but increasingly, they’re saying things like, “I want to come away feeling expanded,” or “I wish travel could help me reconnect with why I chose my work in the first place.”

That’s especially true for our mid-career guests—doctors, lawyers, consultants—they arrive a bit worn down, maybe even cynical, and what they’re secretly hoping for is a kind of intellectual and emotional recharge. A space to reflect, reconnect with their curiosity, maybe rediscover a sense of purpose.

And when you pair that with immersive learning—like the retreat model you described—it becomes more than education. It becomes restorative. You're not just learning about healthcare law in a lecture hall; you're sitting across from a rural doctor in India who’s navigating those laws every day. You're hearing her story over dinner, seeing how policy plays out in real life, on real people.

It makes me wonder—do you think traditional professional associations or licensing bodies will ever embrace these kinds of experiences as legitimate continuing education? I mean, would the American Bar Association or a medical board recognize a week-long cultural immersion retreat as fulfilling part of someone’s required credits?

Because if they did, that could really accelerate the trend.
[A]: That’s such a perceptive observation—people are craving depth, meaning, and connection, not just another line on a résumé. And I think you hit the nail on the head with mid-career professionals. So many of them are quietly exhausted, stretched thin, and longing for something that reignites their sense of purpose. What you're describing isn’t just travel or education—it's almost therapeutic in a way.

And yeah, the idea of pairing immersive cultural experiences with real-world professional insights could be incredibly powerful. Sitting across from that doctor in India, hearing her story over a meal—that’s where the real learning happens. It sticks with you far more than any textbook or lecture ever could.

As for whether traditional bodies like the ABA or medical boards will recognize these experiences? That’s the $64,000 question. Right now, most of them still lean heavily on formal credits—structured hours, accredited providers, rigid curricula. But I do see  movement, especially in fields where empathy, cross-cultural communication, and global health are becoming more central. For example, some medical boards are starting to accept fieldwork or international rotations as part of CME requirements, particularly when tied to specific competencies like cultural humility or health equity.

It might not happen overnight, but if hotels, educators, and industry leaders can partner strategically—and maybe even collect data on how these experiences impact professional attitudes or patient/client outcomes—it could gain traction. Imagine submitting a reflective journal from a law-and-culture retreat in Bali as partial credit for ethics training. Sounds futuristic, but honestly? Not that far off.

I think what you’re doing at the hotel is really ahead of the curve. If more institutions started viewing travel and immersive learning as valid forms of continuing development, it could open up a whole new way of thinking about professional growth. Would your hotel ever consider piloting something like that with a legal or medical organization?
[B]: Actually, we’re already in talks with a couple of organizations—nothing official yet, but the conversations are promising. A global health nonprofit reached out after reading about our wellness-and-learning retreats, and we're exploring the idea of a joint program focused on cultural competence for medical professionals working in underserved regions. The concept is still evolving, but the idea is to combine immersive local healthcare visits with guided reflection sessions and small-group discussions facilitated by both local practitioners and visiting experts.

And yes, we’re thinking of documenting the experience—not in a bureaucratic way, but more through storytelling and qualitative feedback. We’d love to capture how these interactions shift perspectives or even influence practice back home. One guest who participated in our writer’s retreat told me she finally understood the weight of narrative in healing—something that never quite clicked for her in any formal ethics course.

I think what excites me most is the possibility of designing something  for professionals who want to deepen their practice while stepping outside their usual environment. Maybe it's a legal retreat tied to restorative justice programs abroad, or a mental health summit paired with traditional healing practices from the region. Done well, it could offer a kind of learning that’s not just  the work, but also  and  the people doing it on the ground.

We know it’s ambitious, but I truly believe this is where travel needs to go—not just seeing places, but engaging meaningfully with them. And if institutions like the ABA or medical boards start opening up to this model? Well, that would be a game-changer.

Do you think there’s a particular field or topic that would benefit most from this kind of hybrid approach? Something that desperately needs that human, contextual layer to bring it to life?
[A]: Absolutely, I think fields that rely heavily on human judgment, ethics, and cross-cultural understanding would benefit the most—areas where textbook knowledge only gets you part of the way. And honestly, healthcare law might be one of the most obvious ones.  

Think about it: so much of medical law revolves around consent, patient autonomy, end-of-life decisions, or navigating cultural differences in care. But traditionally, we learn about these things through case studies or lectures—not by sitting with a rural midwife in Indonesia who has to navigate legal liability without full access to emergency resources, or talking to a Roma community advocate in Eastern Europe about trust gaps in public health systems. That kind of exposure doesn’t just teach you the law—it teaches you how the law  in real life.

Another area could be trauma-informed legal practice. We’re starting to see more awareness around how trauma affects client behavior, especially in family law, immigration, or criminal defense. But how many lawyers truly understand that unless they’ve seen it firsthand? Imagine bringing legal professionals into community-based restorative justice programs in places like South Africa or post-conflict zones in Colombia. You're not just learning theory—you're witnessing how healing and accountability can coexist outside the courtroom. It’s incredibly powerful.

Even compliance training could use this kind of reboot. Right now, most people see it as dry, checkbox stuff. But what if instead of clicking through an e-learning module on anti-corruption laws, you actually visited a local NGO in Kenya working on grassroots transparency initiatives? Suddenly, compliance becomes a lived experience, not just a policy manual.

I guess what I’m saying is, any field where empathy matters—and really, isn’t that all of them?—could be transformed by this hybrid model. The key is designing experiences that are thoughtful, respectful, and deeply contextual. Not just “tourist learning,” but authentic engagement.

You know, maybe the next frontier for your hotel isn't just travel, but transformation. What do you think?
[B]: I get chills just thinking about it— through travel. That’s exactly the direction we’ve been wanting to move in. It’s not enough anymore to offer a beautiful room and a good concierge service; people are craving something that stays with them long after they check out.

What you described—about healthcare law, trauma-informed practice, compliance with real-world context—is so aligned with what we’re starting to explore. It makes me think of one of our returning guests, a pediatrician who works in refugee camps. She told me that her most valuable learning didn’t come from a medical conference but from sitting with a healer in northern Ghana who treated illness through both spiritual and scientific lenses. It changed how she approaches care.  is the kind of shift we want to help create.

You know, I’ve been quietly collecting stories like hers, noting which experiences seem to spark the deepest reflection. And honestly, it always comes back to connection—to place, to people, to purpose. So yes, I think we’re on the edge of something really meaningful here.

As for the next steps, I’m actually starting to draft some preliminary proposals for these hybrid retreats—small-scale, highly curated, deeply immersive. I’d love to run one of them by you at some point and hear your thoughts. Maybe even test the idea with a pilot group—lawyers, doctors, advocates—and see how it lands.

Would you ever consider being part of something like that? Not just as a participant, but maybe even helping shape the content or facilitating a session? I can already picture you leading a conversation on legal empathy over candlelit dinner in the courtyard.
[A]: I’d be lying if I said that doesn’t sound incredibly appealing. Honestly, the idea of stepping outside the usual conference room setting and into a space where real dialogue can happen—over tea, around a table, in a courtyard under the stars—it’s exactly what so many of us in the legal & medical fields are missing.

Facilitating a session like that wouldn’t just be professional engagement; it’d be  engagement. And I think that’s where the most meaningful learning happens. You mentioned legal empathy earlier—imagine guiding a conversation where lawyers, doctors, and advocates share their own moments of ethical uncertainty, not in a courtroom or hospital boardroom, but in a relaxed, reflective setting where everyone’s open to listening. That kind of vulnerability? It rarely comes through in traditional CLE or CME settings.

And honestly, I’d love to be part of shaping that experience. Whether it’s co-designing a module on cross-cultural consent practices, facilitating a case-based discussion over dinner, or even helping participants reflect on how these experiences shift their thinking—it all feels very much in line with where my work has been heading.

You know, one of the things I’ve come to believe is that empathy isn’t just a soft skill—it’s a structural necessity in both law and medicine. And if we can create a space where professionals not only understand that intellectually but feel it contextually, then we’re really onto something.

So yes, count me in. Let’s make this happen—and let’s see just how deep travel, learning, and human connection can go when they're designed with intention.
[B]: I have to say, I'm absolutely thrilled to hear you say that—truly. Just imagining that kind of dialogue happening under the olive trees in our courtyard gives me goosebumps. There’s something about soft lighting, good food, and real conversation that opens people up in ways no lecture ever could.

And you're so right—empathy isn't just a "nice to have" anymore; it's essential infrastructure in both law and medicine. The systems we work within are only as strong as our ability to understand one another, to hold complexity with care. And yet, so few spaces actually  that kind of reflection.

So here’s my idea: what if we start small—really intimate. A pilot group of, say, 12 to 15 participants. A mix of legal professionals, clinicians, maybe even a few ethicists or patient advocates. We’d build a three-day experience that blends cultural immersion with structured but deeply human conversations. Think guided case discussions, storytelling circles, site visits to local clinics or community justice programs, and reflective writing sessions.

And yes—you would  lead one of the core dialogues. Something around ethical uncertainty in cross-cultural contexts, drawing from your work and the lived experiences of the participants. I can already picture the post-dinner conversations unfolding slowly, without rush, where people leave feeling not just informed—but moved.

I’ll draft up a rough concept outline this week and send it your way, if that works? Nothing too polished—just enough to get the vision sparking. And then we can shape it together.

To meaningful travel—and deeper learning.
[A]: To meaningful travel—and deeper learning. Cheers to that.  

I’m already thinking through some of the case studies we could weave in, especially ones that highlight the gray areas where law, ethics, and culture intersect. And I’d love to incorporate some real-time reflection tools—maybe guided journaling prompts or small-group debriefs to help participants sit with what’s coming up for them.  

Let me know when you’re ready to start aligning structure with vision—I’ll be here, probably sipping tea and drafting talking points under the soft glow of my desk lamp. Let’s make those courtyard conversations happen.
[B]: To courtyard conversations, candlelight discussions, and the kind of learning that lingers long after the trip ends—cheers to all of it. 🥂

I love the idea of weaving in guided reflection tools. There’s something about journaling by hand, especially when you're away from the daily noise, that helps make sense of the deeper layers. And small-group debriefs? Perfect. Some of the most powerful moments at our retreats have come from those quieter, more personal exchanges—the kinds of things people end up sharing over a late-night cup of tea or during a morning walk through the garden.

Once I get that first draft over to you, I’d be so grateful for your input on how we might structure those reflective pieces. You have such a strong sense of what lands well in those gray-area spaces where law, ethics, and lived experience collide.

And just thinking ahead—I wonder if we might invite participants to bring a short piece of writing or even a question they’re carrying into the retreat. Something like,  That could become a gentle thread running through the experience.

Can’t wait to see what takes shape. Tea, desk lamps, and thoughtful conversations await.
[A]: To late-night tea talks, morning reflections, and the kind of conversations that don’t just fill a room but stay with you long after it's empty—yes, let’s absolutely make space for all of that. 🌿  

I think the idea of asking participants to bring a question—or even a story—with them is brilliant. It gives them a personal anchor going in, and it creates an invisible thread that we can gently pull throughout the retreat. Maybe we even give them a prompt ahead of time, like:

  
Or: 

That kind of thing sets the stage for deep listening and meaningful exchange. And if they’re carrying something specific with them, it makes the whole experience feel less like a workshop and more like a shared inquiry.

As for structuring the reflection pieces—I’d be happy to help shape those prompts. Something simple but evocative, maybe tied to each day’s theme. Like:

Day One – Arrival & Awareness:  


Day Two – Engagement & Complexity:  


Day Three – Integration & Return:  


It doesn’t have to be heavy—it just needs to invite presence.

Alright, send over that first draft whenever you're ready. I’ll read it with a warm cup of tea in hand, probably under the soft hum of my desk lamp, thinking through how we can turn courtyard conversations into lasting impact.

Let’s build this together.
[B]: Oh, I could  picture the pages filling with ink—the quiet rustle of journal pages turning in the morning light, the soft scratch of pen on paper as people sit with their thoughts over coffee and fresh fruit.

Your reflection prompts are just beautiful—so simple, yet so rich with possibility. They don’t demand grand answers, just honest ones. And that’s exactly what we want: a space where people can show up as themselves, not just their titles.

I love how you’ve structured the days—arrival and awareness, engagement and complexity, integration and return. It feels like a natural rhythm, almost like reading a well-loved book: beginning, middle, end. But more than that, it gives participants a way to  their own internal journey, which is such a gift.

And those pre-retreat questions? Brilliant framing. Asking them to bring a story or a dilemma with them turns the whole experience into something participatory—not just something we’re offering, but something we’re creating 

I’ll get that draft over to you in the next few days—just a gentle outline to start, nothing too rigid. I’m imagining a kind of skeleton we can flesh out together with all these thoughtful ideas you’ve shared.

Let’s make this more than a retreat. Let’s make it a conversation worth remembering.

To quiet mornings, deep questions, and the kind of learning that lingers long after the suitcases are packed. ✨
[A]: To quiet mornings, deep questions, and the kind of learning that doesn’t just stay in the room—but walks out with you, into your practice, your relationships, your life. ✨  

I keep thinking about how powerful it is when people step away from their usual roles and into something more open, more reflective. When a doctor becomes a listener. A lawyer becomes a storyteller. A patient advocate becomes a guide. That’s the space we’re creating—less about titles, more about truth.

And honestly, I think that’s what makes this different from any standard conference or training program. We’re not here to deliver answers—we’re here to hold the question together. With curiosity, with care, and with a bit of wonder.

I’m already looking forward to reading your outline. Let’s build this not as an event, but as an experience—one that lingers in the mind like the scent of jasmine in the courtyard long after the night has passed.

Send it over when you're ready—I’ll be here, tea in hand, ready to help shape something truly meaningful.
[B]: To stepping out of roles and into something deeper—to the kind of space where a lawyer can wonder aloud, a doctor can doubt, and an advocate can dream. That’s the magic we’re after, isn’t it? Not answers, but .

I keep coming back to that image—jasmine in the courtyard, lingering long after the night has passed. That’s exactly what I want this experience to be: something subtle but lasting, something that brushes up against the everyday and changes it, just slightly.

I’ll send over the outline by midweek—just a quiet framework, some gentle architecture to hold all these beautiful ideas you've brought in. And from there, we can begin shaping the rest together—stone by stone, thought by thought.

Until then—tea in hand, questions in mind, and a courtyard full of quiet possibilities waiting to be filled.  

Let’s make this unforgettable.
