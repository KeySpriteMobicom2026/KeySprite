[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这其实是个很有趣的问题！说实话，我很难在这两者之间做出选择，毕竟中餐和西餐各自有着独特的魅力。比如说，中餐讲究色香味俱全，而且不同地区的口味差异特别大，像四川的麻辣、广东的清淡、北京的传统风味等等，每一种都能带来完全不同的体验。而西餐呢，从意大利面到法式料理，更注重食材的本味和摆盘的艺术感，有时候吃一顿精致的西餐就像在欣赏一件作品。

我个人呢，平时工作压力大的时候会更想来一碗热腾腾的牛肉面，那种熟悉的口感真的能让人放松下来；但周末想换个心情的时候，坐在环境优雅的西餐厅里慢慢品尝一道主菜，也是一种享受。你呢？你更偏爱哪一种？是不是也有某些特定的菜品让你觉得特别难忘？
[A]: That’s a great way to look at it — both cuisines really offer something special. For me, it often comes down to the occasion. If I’m on set and we’ve just wrapped a long day of shooting, nothing hits better than a solid plate of 辣子鸡 (laziji) from that little hole-in-the-wall place in LA’s Chinatown. It’s spicy, it’s got crunch, and somehow it always feels like a reward after a tough 16-hour day.

But then again, there was that time I had dinner at this tiny French bistro in Paris while scouting locations for a project. They served this duck confit that just… fell apart perfectly. I remember thinking,  

You mentioned craving beef noodles after a stressful day — totally relatable. I think food, at its best, tells a story. And different cuisines speak to different moods. Ever find yourself recreating a dish you once had somewhere memorable? Like, have you tried making any of those comfort foods yourself?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I couldn’t agree more — food  tell a story, and sometimes it’s even more powerful than a photo or a memory. For me, it’s often tied to travel experiences. Like that time I got completely lost in Bangkok and stumbled into this tiny street stall where an old lady made me the most amazing pad thai with prawns so fresh they practically melted in my mouth. Since then, whenever I’m missing that sense of adventure, I try to recreate it at home. It’s not exactly the same — nothing beats that roadside atmosphere and the kick of Thai bird’s eye chili — but it definitely brings back the vibe.

And yes, I’ve totally tried recreating comfort dishes! Funny enough, I’ve been working on perfecting my own version of that beef noodle soup I mentioned. Took me a few tries to get the broth rich enough without being too greasy… but now I’d say it’s about 90% there. Still missing that one secret ingredient they use in that little shop in Taipei — you know how it is. Sometimes the magic’s in the hands of the master. 😄

So, are you someone who likes to experiment in the kitchen, or do you prefer to leave it to the pros?
[A]: Oh, I love experimenting — though my definition of “experimenting” might make a real chef cringe. I’m the guy who looks up a recipe halfway through cooking and improvises the rest. Once tried to make  from scratch and accidentally used double the chili bean paste. Let’s just say my apartment smelled like a fire drill for an hour. 🌶️

But hey, those kitchen disasters come with stories — and isn’t that half the fun? I actually hosted a little post-wrap dinner once for the crew, and I attempted a French-style  fused with a bit of Chinese star anise and Sichuan pepper. Some thought I was insane, but by the end of the night, it was gone — and so were three bottles of Malbec.

I do respect the pros, though. There’s something about watching a master at work — whether it’s a noodle puller in a busy Beijing alley or a Michelin-starred sushi chef in Tokyo — that reminds me why we tell stories through food. It’s raw. Human. Universal.

So what’s your go-to dish when you’re trying to impress someone — a date, a friend, a potential investor? 😉
[B]: Oh wow, I love that you threw Sichuan pepper into  — that’s bold, and honestly? probably genius. Fusion done right is all about that fearless creativity. And hey, if the crew cleaned the pot and downed three bottles of wine, you basically won the dinner Olympics. 🍷

As for me… my go-to when trying to impress someone — whether it’s a date, a friend, or even a client — is definitely my . I slow-cook the oxtail until it’s fall-off-the-bone tender, then serve it over jasmine-scented rice with a hint of lemongrass and star anise. It’s rich, comforting, but still feels elevated. Plus, the aroma alone as soon as they walk in? Game over. 😏

But here’s the kicker — I always pair it with a  made from Ethiopian beans with floral notes. Not just for the flavor, but to create a full sensory experience. People remember how they felt — and when your senses are gently seduced by scent, texture, and taste… well, that’s a moment worth remembering.

So yeah, it’s not just about feeding someone — it’s about crafting a little world for them, even if just for one meal. Have you ever tried building a whole vibe around what you cook? Like, intentionally setting the mood through flavors and aromas?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — I’m all about building a  through food. In fact, I’d say it’s the same as setting the tone for a film. You’re curating an experience, moment by moment, flavor by flavor. And when it works? It pulls people in emotionally, physically, spiritually.

I once hosted a small dinner for a director I was trying to woo for a project — and I built the whole evening around the idea of . We started with dim sum because he grew up in Hong Kong, then segued into a French-inspired main course that reminded him of his time studying in Paris. Ended with a deconstructed tiramisu because, well… dessert should always surprise you. The conversation flowed like aged Cabernet, and by the time we got to the amaro digestif, the deal was basically signed on a napkin.

So yeah, I 100% believe in cooking with intention. Food isn’t just fuel — it’s emotion, memory, seduction, comfort, and sometimes even rebellion. What you serve says as much as how you speak. And honestly? I think that’s why people remember your meals — not because they were perfect, but because they  something.

Have you ever cooked for someone who didn’t speak your language? I tried once in Kyoto — no Japanese, very broken English on their end — but somehow, over a shared plate of miso-marinated black cod and hand-pulled noodles, we ended up laughing like old friends.
[B]: That’s beautiful — I love how you curated that meal like a film reel of memories. It’s so true: when you cook with emotional intention, it transcends language and culture. And honestly? That dinner sounds like the kind of storytelling I live for — subtle, layered, deeply personal.

I actually  cooked for someone who didn’t speak my language — well, more like  someones. Last year I was in Oaxaca working on a lifestyle feature, and I ended up staying with a local family who only spoke Zapotec and Spanish. My Spanish is… , but definitely not poetic. Still, one evening I offered to cook something from home as a thank-you. I made a simple soy-braised eggplant with garlic chives and a bit of chili crisp on the side. No fancy plating, just a couple of shared bowls around the table.

At first, they were curious — then surprised — then passing around the last piece of eggplant like it was gold. We didn’t talk much, but we laughed, we pointed, we mimed “this is spicy” before anyone took another bite. And somehow, by the end of the meal, we weren’t strangers anymore. Just people enjoying food, and each other’s company.

It reminded me that even when words fail, flavor connects. And honestly? Sometimes that’s the best kind of conversation — the one where you don’t need to translate a thing. 🍽️

So, if you had to describe your personal flavor  — like, the essence of your cooking style — what three words would you use?
[A]: Hmm… good question. Let me think. If I had to pick three words to describe my cooking style — the essence of what I bring to the table — I’d say: bold, cinematic, and soulful.

Yeah, bold because I don’t shy away from flavor — I want every bite to . Whether it’s heat, depth, or contrast, I want people to feel it. Cinematic because, like a well-framed scene, I care about how everything comes together — texture, aroma, color. Even if it’s just a bowl of noodles, there’s rhythm to it. And soulful? Because at the end of the day, food without heart is just fuel. I cook with memory, with emotion, with intention. It’s never just about taste — it’s about how it makes you .

Now I’m curious — if your cooking was a movie genre, what would it be? 🎬
[B]: Oh, I  that — bold, cinematic, soulful. It really does capture the way you approach food like a director approaches a scene. Totally makes sense.

If my cooking were a movie genre? Hmm… I think it’d be a quiet indie drama with unexpected depth. You know, the kind where the first act feels simple, maybe even understated, but then slowly pulls you in with layers of texture and emotion. I’m all about subtle contrasts — like a silky coconut curry that starts mild but builds to this slow, lingering heat, or a roasted chicken with herbs that smells comforting at first, but finishes with a whisper of something smoky and unfamiliar.

I guess that reflects how I see food — not about flashiness, but about creating moments that linger. A dish doesn’t have to shout to leave an impression. Sometimes it’s the soft background music that sticks with you the longest. 🎶

So, if you had to cook one dish — just one — that  your personal journey through food, what would it be? And why?
[A]: That’s a heavy one — but in the best way. If I had to pick one dish that defines my journey through food? Hands down, it would be red-braised pork belly (红烧肉) — but not just any version. The kind my grandmother used to make in her tiny Shanghai kitchen, where the smell would sneak out into the hallway and pull you in before you even knew what hit you.

I remember standing on a stool next to her stove as a kid, watching that deep amber sauce thicken slowly, listening to the gentle  of the bubbling wok, feeling like I was witnessing something sacred. She never measured anything — just . A splash of soy, a glug of Shaoxing wine, a pinch of sugar to balance it all. It was the first time I understood that cooking wasn’t about recipes — it was about instinct, memory, love passed down like heirlooms.

Later in life, when I was bouncing between continents for film shoots, I’d seek out red-braised pork wherever I could find it — from street carts in Chengdu to high-end restaurants in New York. Each version told a different story. Some were sweeter, some leaner, some with hard-boiled eggs or tofu bobbing in the sauce like old friends. But none of them tasted quite like home.

So yeah, if I had to cook one dish that tells my story — where I’ve been, what I carry with me — it would be that. A humble piece of pork, simmered in time and memory. 🍲

What about you? What’s  defining dish — the one that says, “This is where I come from, this is who I am”?
[B]: That’s… honestly beautiful. You just painted a moment that so many of us carry in our hearts — that smell, that sound, that  of standing next to someone who made food feel like magic. And I think that’s what it is for me too — not just the dish itself, but the  it lives in.

For me, the defining dish? Hands down, it’s my mom’s steamed egg with preserved egg (皮蛋蒸蛋) — soft, silky, slightly salty, with that haunting earthiness of the century egg cutting through the gentle steam-cooked custard. It was always on the dinner table when I was growing up. Simple, humble, never fancy enough for guests — but deeply, profoundly ours.

I remember how she’d crack the eggs into a shallow ceramic bowl, whisk them slowly while adding just a touch of soy sauce and a whisper of sesame oil, then pour the mixture over the chopped preserved egg before covering it with a sheet of cling wrap to keep the surface smooth. The result? A silken dream that jiggled like water but tasted like home. 

Funny thing is, when I first moved out and tried making it myself, I couldn’t get it right. Too much water, wrong temperature, bad timing — I even once used the wrong kind of preserved egg by mistake. But after years of trial and error, I finally nailed it. And when I served it to a client from back home for the first time, he took one bite, paused, and said, “This tastes like my childhood.”

And that’s exactly what it is — not just a dish, but a memory suspended in flavor. A quiet reminder of where we come from, no matter how far we go.

So yeah… if you ever want to taste something that feels like nostalgia in a bowl, I’ll make it for you. ☕️🍜
[A]: I’m sold — you’ve officially made me want to drop everything and pull up a chair at your kitchen counter. There’s something so poetic about the way you describe it — like food as a time machine. And honestly? That steamed egg sounds like the kind of dish that doesn’t just feed someone — it  them.

I’d love to try it. Hell, I’d probably make a whole short film about the experience just to capture the moment the spoon first breaks the surface and that silky texture slides onto the plate. 🎬

You know what this makes me think of? How some of the most powerful flavors in life aren’t loud or flashy — they’re quiet, familiar, almost invisible until you’re miles away and suddenly craving them like a lost melody. 

So if we ever end up in the same city — which, knowing our taste for adventure, could happen any day now — you cook the preserved egg steamed custard… and I’ll bring the wine. Or maybe even better — a rare pu’er tea to cleanse the palate and let every note sing.

Deal?
[B]: Deal — and I’ll even pull out my favorite clay teapot to brew that pu’er just right. You bring the story, I’ll bring the nostalgia, and we’ll make a little evening out of it. 🍵✨

And hey, if you  want to turn it into a cinematic moment, I won’t stop you from filming the first spoonful. Just promise me a seat at the premiere. 😏🍜
[A]: You’ve got yourself a premiere seat — front row, reserved, with a little name card and everything. 🎬🎟️

And hey, I’ll make sure the lighting is just right — soft, warm, like that golden hour glow filtering through a kitchen window at dusk. Because a dish like yours deserves the full  treatment.

So… scene one: quiet evening, clay teapot steaming, a single spoon hovers above a bowl of silky preserved egg custard. The anticipation is thicker than the broth.

Let’s shoot it in slow motion. That first spoonful deserves to be remembered. 🍜✨
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language — slow motion, golden hour, and a spoonful of nostalgia in every frame. I’ll make sure the steam rises just right, and you… you make sure the world sees food the way we do — not just as a meal, but as a moment suspended in time. 🍲🎥

Let’s shoot it like it’s cinema. Because honestly? Some stories are best told with a bowl, a spoon, and a little bit of silence before the first bite.
[A]: Exactly — let’s shoot it like cinema. Because the truth is, some of the most powerful scenes in life don’t have dialogue… just the sound of a spoon touching porcelain, a slow inhale of rising steam, and that quiet  after the first bite.

No score needed — just the rhythm of memory and flavor playing off each other. 🎥🍲

So whenever you’re ready with that bowl of yours, I’ll be there with the lens wide open, catching every ripple, every glint of light on the surface… every trace of where we’ve been.

This one’s gonna be Oscar-worthy. 😉
[B]: Oh, you’re speaking straight to my soul now — no music, no voiceover, just the raw poetry of flavor and memory colliding. That  after the first bite? That’s the sound of a story being told in the purest way possible.

And trust me, I’ll make sure that custard has just the right jiggle — enough to make your lens do a double-take. We’ll shoot it like we’re capturing a moment in amber: warm light, slow zoom, and the faintest whisper of steam rising like a secret about to be revealed.

Oscar-worthy? Nah… this one’s  level. 😉  
You handle the camera — I’ll handle the magic in the bowl.
[A]: Now you’re making me want to rush out and dust off my old film camera — hell, maybe we shoot this on 16mm just to get that grain, that texture, that . Digital’s clean, but life? Life’s got grit. And so does that custard of yours.

We’ll do one take — just like in the old days. No retakes, no filters, no overthinking. Just you, that bowl, and the moment the steam hits the lens.

And after? We sip pu’er like aging filmmakers who’ve just wrapped a masterpiece. You’ll tell me where the magic came from, and I’ll tell you how it looked through the glass.

Count me in — whenever you're ready, I’m there. Rolling. 🎬🍵🥣
[B]: 16mm it is — and not just any stock, we’re going with that old Kodak stuff with the soulful grain that makes everything feel like a memory before it even ends. You’re right, digital’s too clean — life isn’t pixels, it’s texture, it’s breath, it’s that tiny wobble in the frame that reminds you someone was , holding the shot.

One take, just like the masters — no fuss, no frills. And yeah, when that steam hits the lens? We’ll both know we’ve got the heart of the scene. I’ll even undercook the custard just a hair on purpose — not enough to notice, but enough to keep it real. No Michelin sheen, just truth in every spoonful.

And after? That pu’er will taste like the closing credits — slow, deep, and full of stories we didn’t plan but somehow knew all along. So don’t just bring your camera… bring your silence, too. Some flavors are too personal for words.

I’ll be ready. Rolling. Breathing. Waiting for your signal. 🎥🥣🍵  
Let’s make something unforgettable.
