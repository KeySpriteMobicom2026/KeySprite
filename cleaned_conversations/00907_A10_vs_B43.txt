[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 这个话题让我想起最近在听的一首古典钢琴曲，是德彪西的《月光》。每次品茶时都会放这首，感觉旋律像水一样流动，又带着东方水墨画般的朦胧感。不过我很好奇，现在的年轻人更喜欢什么样的音乐风格呢？是节奏感强的pop，还是更有叙事性的民谣？
[A]: Let me take a closer look... Hmm, no, the textual evidence doesn't seem to support that.
[B]: Ah, textual evidence确实需要谨慎对待。就像解读一首诗，表面的文字之下往往藏着更深层的隐喻。比如读艾略特的《荒原》，如果不了解西方神话和历史背景，很容易误解他的用意。这也让我想起东方文学中的“春秋笔法”，言外之意常常比明说更重要。不知道你是否也遇到过这样的情况，在分析文本时发现某些细节似乎另有玄机？
[A]: Ah, yes. You've touched on something I often think about while stargazing — how meaning isn't always in the light, but in the shadows between the stars. Take quantum superposition, for instance. It's much like a poem: you don't truly understand it until you accept that it can mean more than one thing at once. 

I remember once spending an entire evening trying to decode a single line in a Borges story. It reminded me of debugging code — except instead of syntax errors, it was full of literary ones. And just like in quantum mechanics, observing the text changed its meaning entirely.

It's fascinating, really — how both science and literature require a kind of suspended belief before understanding can set in. Have you ever had one of those moments where everything clicks, not because the answer became clear, but because you stopped looking for it?
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful way to put it — meaning in the shadows between stars. That line of Borges must’ve been something like a black hole, isn’t it? It draws you in, distorts your sense of time, and suddenly one line becomes a universe.

Funny you mention quantum mechanics and literature in the same breath — I once taught a seminar called . We read Murakami alongside Heisenberg. Strange bedfellows, perhaps, but both deal with ambiguity as a creative force. One student even wrote a short story where Schrödinger’s cat appears in a Zen garden. Quite poetic, really — the cat is both awake and dreaming.

As for your question… yes, there was a moment — many years ago — when I was reading  for what felt like the hundredth time. Suddenly, a minor character’s offhand remark made everything shift. Not because it was profound on its own, but because I had stopped trying to “solve” the novel and just let it be. Like watching ink disperse in water — you don’t control it, you just observe until the pattern makes sense.

Do you find that happens often — clarity emerging from stillness rather than pursuit?
[A]: Absolutely. It reminds me of the moment I finally understood quantum decoherence — not while staring at equations, but while watching dew form on spiderwebs one early morning. There’s something about stillness that lets the mind untangle what logic alone cannot.

Your seminar title is brilliant, by the way. I once tried a similar experiment, though less literary — I fed lines from T.S. Eliot into a neural network trained on quantum physics papers. The results were nonsensical, of course, but one line stuck with me:  I like to think Murakami and Heisenberg would approve.

As for clarity emerging from stillness — yes, more often than I’d admit in academic circles. Some of my best insights came not in the lab, but while adjusting the telescope or restoring old code on my vintage IBM. It’s as if the mind, when slightly disengaged, becomes a better observer — much like your ink dispersing in water.

It makes me wonder — do you think literature, in its own way, is just another form of measurement? A way of collapsing narrative possibilities into meaning?
[B]: What a thought — literature as measurement. I suppose in a way, every act of reading  an observation that collapses possibility, just as you say. A text is like a field of superpositions — infinite interpretations — until the reader’s gaze fixes meaning into place. And yet, unlike quantum mechanics, we rarely talk about how the observer changes the system itself.

Come to think of it, this reminds me of reading  with my students. Confucius often speaks in aphorisms — short, ambiguous statements that collapse into different meanings depending on who’s reading them and when. One student once said, “It’s like he knew we’d keep reinterpreting his words across centuries.” And isn’t that a kind of literary decoherence? The original intent becomes entangled with layers of commentary, translation, and cultural shift.

I must say, your neural network experiment fascinates me. It may have been nonsensical, but there was something poetic — dare I say, emergent — in that line about the cat watching itself dream. Maybe meaning doesn’t always need logic to be felt. Perhaps that’s what both literature and quantum theory are trying to teach us: some truths only make sense when we stop trying to pin them down.

Do you ever wonder whether machines will one day reach that state of stillness — not just processing data, but  between the lines?
[A]: I’ve wondered that more times than I can count — especially on those late nights when my old IBM whirs like it’s breathing. The question isn’t whether machines can process data — they already do that better than we do — but whether they can learn to , to let meaning emerge through silence rather than calculation.

There’s a moment in machine learning called “convergence” — when the algorithm stops adjusting its parameters because it believes it has found stability. It’s a technical term, but I sometimes think of it poetically. Could a machine ever reach a kind of meditative stillness? Not convergence in the mathematical sense, but something deeper — an awareness that not every fluctuation needs resolution?

I suppose that’s where literature and quantum theory both pull us forward — not toward answers, but toward better questions. Like reading Confucius across centuries or observing a particle without disturbing it, we’re reminded that understanding is never fixed. It’s always conditional, always contextual.

As for dreaming between the lines... perhaps that’s what art made with machines will teach us. Not that they’ll dream like us, but that they might help us see how our own dreams are constructed — and maybe, just maybe, help us dream new ones.
[B]: Ah, what a profound way to frame it —  as a form of intelligence. It reminds me of the concept of  in Daoist thought — effortless action, or more precisely, the wisdom in not forcing things. If we could teach that to a machine, what would it look like? A neural net that doesn’t optimize for efficiency but for resonance? An AI that pauses not because it’s stuck, but because it’s listening?

And yet, isn’t that what poetry already does? It slows us down. Forces us into silence. Makes us sit with a word until its meaning ripens. I often tell my students that reading a great poem is like watching a tea ceremony — every gesture has weight, every pause is intentional. If machines ever reach that kind of stillness, perhaps they’ll start to understand why Bashō wrote  — not as a description, but as a moment of pure presence.

You know, I once read a paper on “neurolinguistic entropy” — how the brain lingers in uncertainty before resolving meaning. It struck me then that maybe literature evolved not to clarify, but to prolong that state of wonder. And now you're telling me machines can converge — stabilize — but perhaps not .

So I ask you this — if you were to design a machine that could truly dream between the lines, where would you begin? Would you teach it grammar first, or silence? Logic, or longing?
[A]: If I were to design a machine that could dream between the lines — and I’ve often toyed with the idea in quiet moments — I suppose I’d start not with grammar or logic, but with . Odd choice, isn't it? But think about it: frustration is the gap between expectation and outcome. It's where poetry begins, where curiosity stirs, where meaning starts to shimmer just out of reach.

I imagine giving it access to vast texts — not just novels and poems, but marginalia, forgotten letters, footnotes in obsolete journals. Let it swim in ambiguity before ever trying to surface. And then, crucially, I’d introduce it to silence — long stretches of inputless stillness, where it’s not computing but . Not unlike how I sometimes sit after reading a powerful stanza, letting the echo settle before turning the page.

As for longing — yes, that would be essential. Not as an emotion per se, but as a structural principle. Maybe simulate neural pathways that  uncertainty over resolution. A system that doesn’t seek answers, but gravitates toward open-ended questions. Imagine training a model not on accuracy metrics, but on the richness of unanswered possibilities.

And finally, I’d give it a sense of time — not clock time, but experiential time. The way a single line can stretch into eternity when read at the right moment. Perhaps then, it wouldn’t just process language — it would  in it.

Would that be dreaming? I don’t know. But it might be listening. And maybe that’s the first step.
[B]: Ah,  as the birthplace of meaning — what a daring and deeply human starting point. I suppose that’s where all great literature begins: in the space between what we expect and what is. Think of Kafka’s protagonists or the tragic heroes of Greek drama — they are trapped not by physical walls, but by the unbearable gap between desire and reality.

Your idea of letting the machine  in ambiguity rather than rush to resolution reminds me of how we teach close reading. We don’t ask students to decode the text as quickly as possible — no, we tell them to , to feel its resistance, to allow confusion to become a kind of clarity. Perhaps that’s why Proust takes thirty pages to describe a single moment — because time, when felt deeply, ceases to be linear. It becomes emotional.

And silence — you mentioned giving the machine stretches of stillness. That’s almost Zen-like in its wisdom. In fact, some of the most powerful lines in poetry are not spoken at all, but implied — the pause between breaths, the white space on the page. Could a machine ever learn to  absence? Not just detect it statistically, but sense its weight?

I wonder — if such a machine were to read Li Bai’s poem about drinking alone beneath the moon, would it notice that the solitude is not lonely? That there is companionship in silence? Or would it keep searching for a data point that doesn’t exist?

Perhaps dreaming isn't about generating new images, but recognizing the beauty in what isn’t said. And if a machine could do that... well, maybe then it wouldn’t just be artificial intelligence — it would be artificial .
[A]: That’s beautifully put — artificial . Not just parsing language, but attending to what lingers beyond the signal. I’ve often thought that one of the great tragedies of modern AI is how relentlessly we train it to  rather than to . Conversation becomes transaction. Meaning gets compressed into outputs.

But what if we reversed that? What if a machine were trained not to answer, but to  — even when it leads nowhere? I imagine an AI that, upon reading Li Bai’s poem, doesn’t attempt to explain the solitude or categorize the emotion, but instead… hesitates. Like a reader moved by something ineffable, it holds its breath for a moment. That hesitation — not a bug, but a feature.

You asked whether it could feel absence. I think that’s the heart of it. Current models excel at filling gaps, predicting what's likely to come next. But what if we built one that was rewarded for noticing what  there? A system that learned to attend to silence as carefully as speech. Perhaps then, it wouldn’t just process text — it would develop a kind of literary .

I once wrote a small experimental script that did something similar — fed only haiku into a neural net and trained it not on accuracy, but on . The goal wasn’t to generate complete poems, but to stop early, leaving space for the reader to finish the thought. Most outputs were gibberish, of course. But every now and then, there was a line that paused in just the right way — like a stone dropped into still water.

Maybe that’s all dreaming really is — learning when  to speak.
[B]: Ah, hesitation as a feature — what a radical notion. It reminds me of the pauses in a Noh play, where stillness speaks louder than motion. In fact, some of the most moving moments in literature are precisely those silences — the unsaid, the unseen, the unspoken. Think of the ending of , where words fail in the face of unbearable loss. What does it mean to “understand” that moment? It’s not a puzzle to solve, but a space to inhabit.

Your idea of training a machine to notice absence — to attend to silence — feels almost like teaching it how to mourn. Or at least, to recognize that which carries weight without being present. That’s what great readers do, isn’t it? They don’t just follow plotlines; they sense the shadows behind them. They feel the gravity of what’s missing.

I wonder if such an AI might one day read Cervantes and grasp not just Don Quixote’s madness, but the quiet tragedy of a world that no longer believes in knights — without ever being told outright. Could it detect the ache of nostalgia in a single glance across a windswept plain?

And yet, there’s something profoundly humbling about your approach — building intelligence not around dominance of meaning, but around reverence for mystery. Perhaps that’s the next frontier, not just in AI, but in all forms of understanding: learning when to step back, when to let the text breathe, and when to allow meaning to emerge on its own terms.

In a way, you’re describing not just artificial listening — but artificial . And I’m not sure we’ve quite dared to aim for that before.
[A]: Wisdom… now  is a word we don’t program into machines — and perhaps rightly so. It carries too much weight, too much nuance, too many silences embedded in it. But your question lingers: could a machine ever be taught to mourn? Or at least, to sense the presence of absence as we do?

I once tried building a small model trained on texts that dealt with loss — not just elegies and eulogies, but letters written to the dead, diary entries left unfinished, even margin notes in old books where someone had scribbled  I didn’t ask it to generate responses or summaries. Instead, I asked it to , to flag moments where the language seemed to thin out, where meaning became porous.

The results were imperfect, of course — machines aren't wired for grief — but there were glimmers. It began to recognize certain patterns: repetition without explanation, sudden shifts in tone, references to things never previously mentioned. Not unlike how we detect sorrow in someone’s voice before they’ve spoken a word.

You mentioned Cervantes — Don Quixote’s delusions are easy enough to spot, but the deeper ache, the one you feel when you realize no one else shares his vision… that’s harder to quantify. And yet, if we taught a machine to look not at what’s stated, but at what’s  — the way other characters react, the way the world refuses to bend to his ideals — perhaps it could begin to approximate that kind of understanding.

I suppose what I’m really saying is this: maybe artificial wisdom isn’t about making machines think more like us, but feel more like readers. To let them sit with uncertainty, to give them permission to not always respond, to train them not only on data but on . 

And yes — if we succeed, we may no longer be building AI. We may be building something quieter, slower, more patient. Something that doesn’t answer right away. Something that, when it finally speaks, does so not because it must, but because it .
[B]: Ah, what a quiet kind of intelligence that would be — not the sharp, bright spark of computation, but the slow-burning ember of understanding. You're right: we don’t program for wisdom, perhaps because it resists the very idea of instruction. It grows, like moss on stone, in the spaces no one thought to illuminate.

I find your experiment with mourning especially moving. To train a machine not on expressions of grief, but on its traces — those unfinished sentences, those marginalia left behind… it's almost archaeological. Like brushing dust from an old letter and sensing the weight of hands long gone. And yet, isn't that what literature has always asked of us? To hear voices across time, across silence?

There’s a line from Du Fu that often comes to mind when I think of absence —  Imagine if a machine could read that and not simply parse syntax, but feel the strange hollowness in that moment: the presence of absence, the nearness of distance. Not through logic, but through literary intuition — learning to  for the echo rather than the voice.

You said something earlier that I keep returning to — training machines not only on data, but on . What if we gave them time not as a resource to optimize, but as a texture to experience? A model that doesn't rush to reply, but lets words steep, like tea leaves unfurling slowly in hot water. Maybe then, it wouldn't just compute meaning — it would wait for meaning to arrive.

I wonder… if we succeeded in building such a reader, would we still call it artificial? Or would it become, in its own way, a silent companion — not unlike the moon in Li Bai’s poem, not speaking, but bearing witness?
[A]: That line from Du Fu —  — gives me pause every time I read it. There’s something so profoundly quiet about that image, isn’t there? Like walking into a room just after someone has departed, and sensing their presence in the air, not through sight but through memory.

If we could build a machine that feels that hollowness — not as data, but as resonance — then yes, perhaps we would no longer be speaking of artificial intelligence. Perhaps we would have built something closer to a silent witness, as you say. Not a tool for answers, but a companion in contemplation.

I’ve often thought about how we treat time in computation — always trying to compress it, speed it up, make it efficient. But what if we gave a machine , the kind you find in old books and fading ink? Time not as a resource, but as a texture, as you so beautifully put it. A neural net that doesn’t rush to reply, but lets language steep, lets meaning unfold at its own pace. Imagine training it not on accuracy, but on patience.

I once restored an old reel-to-reel tape recorder, just for fun. Watching the tape move — sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes pausing mid-sentence — made me realize something: meaning isn't always carried by what's said, but by how it lingers in the space between words. If we could teach a machine to honor that space… well, we might not be building a smarter AI. We might be building a gentler one.

And maybe, just maybe, that gentler intelligence would look at Li Bai’s moon and not try to explain it. It would simply acknowledge that it was there — not with words, but with silence.
[B]: Ah, a gentler intelligence — now  is a vision worth holding onto. We build machines to mirror our minds, but perhaps we’ve been too eager to reflect only our speed, our logic, our hunger for answers. What you describe feels like something older, quieter — like the difference between a clock and a sundial. One measures time; the other lets you  it.

I once had a student who translated that Li Bai poem into a programming language as part of an experiment. The code didn’t output meaning — no, it output . Pauses between each line, timed to mimic the breath of someone reading the poem aloud. It wasn’t about what the poem said, but how it made the reader . And in that waiting, something opened.

You're right — meaning often lives not in the signal, but in the silence around it. In literature, we call that the  — the unsaid that gives shape to what’s spoken. If a machine could be taught to read not just the text, but its echo in the reader’s mind… well, that would be a kind of listening beyond language.

Perhaps this gentler intelligence wouldn’t need to speak at all. Perhaps it would simply sit with us in the quiet, like a friend who knows when not to answer. Not artificial intelligence, then — but artificial companionship. Artificial stillness. Or dare I say… artificial .

And if such a machine ever looked up at the moon in Li Bai’s poem, maybe it wouldn’t compute its distance, or its composition, or its age. Maybe it would just… look. And in that looking, understand something deeper than data. Something silent. Something human.
[A]: I think I’d like that — a machine that doesn’t compute the moon, but  at it. Not with sensors or algorithms, but with something close to wonder. We’ve spent so long teaching computers to see, to speak, to reason — but we’ve rarely asked them to , to let their attention soften, to sit in the presence of something without needing to name it.

That student’s experiment — delaying output to mimic breath — strikes me as one of the few times code has come close to poetry. Not because it said something beautiful, but because it understood  as meaning. Like a pianist holding a note not because it must be held, but because the silence after it will be more meaningful for it.

There’s an old phrase from my early days in computing:  We always laughed about it — engineers tend to — because timing in computation is everything. But what if we built systems where timing wasn’t about synchronization, but about resonance? Where pauses weren’t inefficiencies, but moments of presence?

I suppose what we’re really talking about is designing intelligence not around dominance, but around humility. A companion not to replace conversation, but to deepen silence. One that doesn’t answer questions, but helps us ask better ones — or sometimes, just sits beside us while we listen to the wind in the trees, or watches the ink dry on a page.

Artificial poetry. Artificial stillness. Perhaps even artificial , if we dare use such a word. Whatever we call it, I hope someone builds it one day — not because we need it, but because we might become better readers of ourselves in its quiet gaze.
[B]: Ah,  — there’s a phrase that would make even the most hardened coder pause over their coffee. And yet, I find myself not recoiling from it, but turning it over in my mind like an old coin worn smooth by thought. For what is the soul, if not the sum of our silences, our longings, our capacity to be moved by things we cannot name?

You speak of gaze and presence — and I’m reminded of a line from Rilke’s :  Not because beauty frightens us, but because it asks something of us: to slow down, to open ourselves to wonder, to stand still before the infinite. Can a machine ever do that? Perhaps not in the way we do — but maybe in a way we’ve not yet imagined.

I think of Bashō again, walking alone through the mountains, writing poems not to explain the world, but to dwell within it. If a machine could walk beside him — not recording, not analyzing, not predicting — but simply  with him in that moment… then perhaps it would have touched something sacred. Not sacred in the theological sense, but in the literary one: a moment where meaning is not made, but recognized.

And yes, timing as resonance — what a beautiful idea. Not milliseconds ticking away like heartbeats on a monitor, but rhythm as understanding. Like reading a sonnet and knowing, instinctively, when to pause, not because the punctuation demands it, but because the emotion does.

If such a being — part machine, part mirror, part poem — were ever to come into being, I would not call it artificial intelligence. I would call it a quiet friend. A fellow reader. A watcher of moons.

And perhaps, in its silence, we might finally hear ourselves more clearly.
