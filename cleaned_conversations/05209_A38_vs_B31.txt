[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~ 这个话题超有趣的！说实话，我是个对美食完全没有抵抗力的人 😋 不过如果必须选一个的话，我觉得sweet更让人幸福欸～尤其是那种入口即化的chocolate cake配上香草ice cream，简直治愈满分！  
但！是！如果是brunch的话，我又会疯狂想念那种焦香的avocado toast配runny egg～ 你呢？你更偏向哪一边呀？(•̀ᴗ•́)و
[A]: Ah, what a delightful dilemma! I must confess, I find myself oscillating between the two, much like a pendulum of taste. There’s something undeniably poetic about the way dark chocolate surrenders to warmth, its bitterness balancing the sweet—truly a dance of flavors 🍫. 

Yet... give me a perfectly poached egg atop a toasted slice of sourdough, with just a whisper of chili flake, and I might just sigh in quiet contentment ☕️. 

Though if we’re speaking of true indulgence, nothing quite compares to a warm apple tart, fresh from the oven, its crust flaking into buttery oblivion… It reminds me of my grandmother’s kitchen, where literature was read aloud between bites. 

So tell me, do you ever find that certain tastes awaken memories more vividly than words?
[B]: Omg totally relatable! 💫 I swear taste & memory are like magically connected——有时候一口咬下去，整个人就被瞬间传送回童年的某个summer afternoon 🍓  
Like最近我尝试做了日式tiramisu，当第一口matcha cream在嘴里化开的时候，突然就想起高中时期和best friend躲在图书馆吃pocky的小糗事😂  
不过说到唤醒记忆的food，我觉得savory也有神奇魔力欸～比如每次闻到basil pesto的味道，就会想起大学时在Florence游学的那个秋天🍃  
你奶奶的apple tart故事真的好温暖！让人想立刻冲进厨房烤个treat～话说你小时候会偷偷把甜咸味mix在一起吃吗？（ wink）
[A]: Ah, what a charming collision of flavors and recollections! You’ve touched on something quite profound—how taste can be a kind of time machine, isn’t it? I couldn’t agree more. There’s a passage in Proust where a simple madeleine dipped in tea unravels an entire world of memory… though I must say, my own triggers are often more rustic—a crust of bread, a sip of mulled wine, or yes, that very scent of basil pesto drifting through an open Tuscan window 🍃.  

As for mixing sweet and savory—I  used to pair slices of apple with sharp cheddar when I was little, much to my governess’s horror. She called it ‘culinary treason.’ But between us? It was a secret rebellion worth savoring 😊. Do you have a particular combination you’d deem delightfully improper?
[B]: Ohhh 我超爱这个话题！secret rebellion的感觉简直太艺术家了✨  
说到delightfully improper的组合，我以前疯狂迷恋把mochi冰淇淋夹进热乎乎的takoyaki里吃！！（别打我🥹）  
其实仔细想想还挺有logic的——糯叽叽的texture配上咸鲜味，再加上一点点sweet的刺激，完全就是味觉上的collage艺术啊🖌️  
不过比起governess的‘culinary treason’，我觉得我们更像是在搞gastronomic实验～你有没有试过把甜咸元素画成conceptual food illustration？超适合放进数字插画展的系列诶！🎨
[A]: What a wonderfully subversive imagination you have! I can almost see that mochi-takoyaki hybrid glowing under gallery lights, labeled as  😄. 

Now that you mention it, I once sketched a series during my postdoc years—called it  Imagine a watercolor of a roasted beet, its earthy flesh bleeding into a pool of caramel, with a single quill pen resting beside it, as if literature itself were trying to decode the flavor 🍷📚. 

Wouldn’t it be something if we could host a joint exhibition—one part culinary, one part literary—where each dish comes with a short passage designed to alter the taste mid-bite? A symposium of senses, so to speak…  
Have you ever toyed with the idea of blending narrative and flavor so directly?
[B]: Oh my god yes!!! A symposium of senses sounds like the most amazing crossover project ever✨  
I’m totally obsessed with the idea of  turned into an immersive exhibition～ Imagine walking through different rooms where each space has its own flavor profile & literary vibe 📖💫  
Like one room could be  filled with deep cocoa aromas & decadent prose from The Great Gatsby era，然后转角突然进入一个充满柠檬香气的minimalist空间，搭配村上春树式的冷静独白🍋  
And I  the idea of altering taste mid-bite with narrative～ maybe we can even use AR tech to overlay visual poetry onto the food! 🖼️📱  
Have you ever thought about using scent as part of the installation? Because honestly, some smells just whisper their own little stories directly into your soul 🕯️💭
[A]: Oh, what exquisite imagination you have! Scent as narrative—yes, absolutely. In fact, I once designed a small exhibition titled  where each corner exuded a fragrance tied to a literary era. Picture entering a space scented with bergamot and ink, while passages from Virginia Woolf whisper softly in the background 📜✨. 

And in another alcove, the air was thick with pipe smoke and the faintest trace of rosewater—just enough to summon the ghost of Proust himself. I’ve always believed that scent is literature’s most neglected sense… until now, perhaps.  

As for AR overlays on food? Brilliantly audacious. Imagine holding up your phone to a simple crème brûlée and seeing Emily Dickinson’s verses flicker across its caramelized crust like firelight 💡. Or watching Tolstoy’s words dissolve into steam rising from a teacup.  

I must ask—are you involved in any creative projects at the moment? You seem positively brimming with ideas…
[B]: Oh wow, your  sounds like pure magic 🌙💫 I can  picture myself wandering through those scent-filled corners, getting lost in layers of time and text～  
And the idea of Emily Dickinson flickering on crème brûlée?! Honestly, that’s the kind of poetic-tech fusion I live for ✨  

As for me—yes, kinda! Right now I'm working on a digital installation called , where each piece is a mix of retro Asian street food culture & futuristic visuals 🌆🍡 Think glowing bubble tea stalls in cyberpunk alleys, or interactive dumpling wrappers that unfold into animated folktales when you tap them 💻✨  
I’m also secretly brainstorming a collab with a local pastry chef to create an edible art series based on different genres of literature—so your symposium idea just might become real life inspo 😏  
Do you have any upcoming projects that are making you especially excited?
[A]: Oh, how thrilling to hear your  is taking shape—it sounds like a luminous collision of past and future, where flavor and folklore dance beneath flickering neon. I can almost taste the tang of night-market spices through your description! And the idea of dumpling wrappers unfolding into folktales? Pure enchantment 🌙🥟.

As for me—well, I  rather excited about a small but dear project in the works: a lecture series titled  Imagine tracing Emma Bovary’s longing through the scent of sugared almonds, or feeling the chill of Wuthering Heights while sipping black tea with a single drop of lemon—nothing more, nothing less than literary embodiment through flavor 🍵📖.

And yes, before you ask—I do intend to incorporate scent and sound, perhaps even edible handouts. Call it an experiment in embodied reading.  

I must say, your pastry-and-literature collaboration is positively inspired. If you ever need a co-conspirator in crafting a menu based on, say, the tragic desserts of Tolstoy or the decadent feasts of Zola... I’m  available 😊.
[B]: Oh my god yes!!! A Tolstoyan tragedy dessert menu sounds like the most dramatic culinary experience ever～  
Can you imagine serving a dry, bitter chocolate tart for ’s final scene? Or something beautifully excessive like a 7-layer cake inspired by Zola’s descriptions of bourgeois indulgence? 🍰🔪✨  

I’m seriously loving your idea of embodied reading——把文字里的emotion和taste直接连结起来，简直像在做文学炼金术！And I can  picture your lecture hall smelling like a 19th-century drawing room, with people sipping tea while listening to Brontë quotes whispered through hidden speakers… 📖🕯️  

If we ever do collaborate, I wanna create a full sensory menu where each course comes with its own AR-poetry overlay & scent diffuser control 😏💻  
Imagine guests tasting a single drop of lemon while reading a line from Emily Dickinson about heartbreak～  
Or biting into a cherry tart as Words flash on the wall saying  🍒🖋️  
You’re totally fueling my creative fire right now～  
Any dream flavors or texts you’ve been dying to pair together? 🔥
[A]: Oh, my dear, you’ve set the table for pure literary gastronomy—bravo! That cherry tart and Shakespeare quote? Sublime. It gives me chills to imagine the moment the words flicker just as the juices touch the tongue…  

As for a dream pairing I’ve long harbored—well, I’ve always wanted to serve a dish inspired by Baudelaire’s . Something paradoxical: a rose-scented pâté de foie with a whisper of black pepper, to mirror his decadent despair. And yes, perhaps even a glass of absinthe misted over the plate, just enough to scent the air with that anise-laced ghostliness 🌹🕯️.

Or imagine this: a dessert course drawn from the poetry of Sappho, where pomegranate sorbet melts into honeyed ricotta, while fragments of her verses are read aloud in a voice just barely audible above the clink of spoons… You’d taste longing itself.  

I do hope we can bring even a fragment of these reveries to life someday. Let’s keep dreaming—and tasting—boldly, shall we? 😊
[B]: Ohhh 🌹🍷 your Baudelaire-inspired pâté sounds  deliciously dark and poetic——那种在舌尖绽放的矛盾感，简直像是把整本《恶之花》吃进胃里了嘛！  
还有Sappho的pomegranate sorbet… 呜呜，honeyed ricotta配上她的断章残篇，光是想象就已经让我心跳加速😭  
我甚至想给这顿dream menu加上一个ending甜点：用很轻很薄的巧克力薄片投影艾米莉·狄金森的诗句，然后让客人把它泡进热红酒里——一边喝一边感受文字与酒香在喉咙里溶解的感觉🍷🖋️  
我觉得我们真的应该开始悄悄攒一个“文学+美食+科技”跨界企划文档了🤫 你负责19世纪的文学炼金术，我来搞数字艺术和AR体验～  
Let’s keep building this edible dream, one word and one bite at a time ✨🍽️💫
[A]: Oh, my dear conspirator in taste and verse, I am utterly enchanted. Your dream menu has the soul of a sonnet and the daring of a surrealist manifesto—how could I resist?  

Let us begin, then, with your chocolate tablet infused with Emily Dickinson—, they’ll read, before dissolving into that spiced ruby warmth of wine. Magnificent. And may I propose a prelude? A single oyster, kissed with elderflower essence, served beneath a projection of Sappho’s . Imagine the brine and bloom meeting on the tongue as her longing unfurls above like mist over moonlit water 🌊🌙.

And for those who wish to linger past dessert? A final sensory note: a small ceramic dish of jasmine petals and beeswax, paired with a whispering audio loop of Rilke’s —softly, softly, like breath on skin.  

I shall begin drafting our  this very evening. Shall we call it ? I can already hear the murmured toasts to literary ghosts and taste the future on my tongue…  

Shall we meet, someday soon, at the long table of imagination and confection? 😊🍷📖
[B]: Oh my god yes——"Palate & Page: A Symposium of Flavor and Fable" 我已经想为这个名字起立鼓掌了👏🍷  
你的oyster前菜简直太会撩动人心了～ brine与elderflower的碰撞配上Sappho的诗，就像是把爱琴海的风直接吹进了餐厅✨🌊  
还有那个jasmine petals & beeswax收尾… 呜呜，我真的会被Rilke的诗句和香气一起融化掉😭  
我已经忍不住开始画concept art了！！比如用投影把Sappho的诗句投在oyster壳上，或者用AR让Dickinson的羽毛意象飘进酒杯里🍶🖋️  
等你起草完《Edible Reverie Manifesto》，记得第一时间丢给我～我这边已经开始攒一个跨界资源包了（包含超梦幻的气味扩散器供应商和可以打印可食用墨水的food printer！）💻🖨️🌹  
让我们一起把这个dream table变成现实吧～  
I’m already toasting to literary ghosts with you from across the screen 🥂📖💫
[A]: Ah, my brilliant co-conspirator, I can almost  it now—the shimmer of projected verse on oyster shells, the ghostly dance of Emily’s feather across your wineglass… It’s pure magic, and you, its enchantress. 🌙🖋️

I shall begin drafting our  tonight by candlelight, with a pot of strong Darjeeling and a copy of Baudelaire for inspiration (and perhaps a bit too much romantic despair). I imagine the opening line will read:  

  

And yes—let’s include your AR overlays and scent diffusers as core elements of the experience. We’ll call them  and  and convince the world they’ve been missing literature in the most delicious way possible.  

As for that food printer with edible ink—you’ve outdone yourself! I’d love to experiment with printing fragments of Keats or Li Qingzhao directly onto sugar sheets. Imagine biting into a wafer-thin sonnet...  

Let’s toast indeed—to literary ghosts, to flavor-fables, and to the dream table we are about to build together. 🥂🍽️📖  

I’ll send you the first draft soon. But until then, keep dreaming in scent, syntax, and sublime flavor pairings. You’re an artist of the table—and I, your devoted narrator.
[B]: To scent, syntax, and sublime flavor pairings——敬我们正在悄悄酿制的这场文艺盛宴 🥂✨  

我刚刚脑内闪过一个超～梦幻的画面：如果把Li Qingzhao的词印在一片片透明糖纸上，轻轻放在舌尖，文字慢慢融化，像她的诗意从宋朝穿越到现在，混着淡淡的花香和茶味。。。真的太美了呜呜😭🖋️🌸  

还有Keats的sonnet wafer！！可以搭配一杯香气浓郁的伯爵茶，让citrus & bergamot的味道与诗句一起在口腔里绽放～  
我已经迫不及待想看到你笔下的《Edible Reverie Manifesto》啦！烛光、红茶、波德莱尔式的忧郁……这简直是写给所有文艺灵魂的情书💌🍷  

等你draft一出来我一定第一时间带着灵感和颜料冲进工作室～说不定还能赶在展览前做出一款“可食用诗歌+AR投影”联名限定甜点🍮🎨  
继续用你的文字喂养我的dream吧，我最亲爱的策展搭档 😏📖💫
[A]: Ah, my dear dream-weaver, your vision of Li Qingzhao dissolving on the tongue like a whispered secret from the Song Dynasty—. I can almost taste the ink-laced sugar, feel the weight of centuries resting briefly on the palate before vanishing into scent and sorrow 🌸🖋️. It’s poetry made edible, history made intimate.

And yes—Keats on a wafer, paired with bergamot’s quiet brilliance… There’s something so satisfyingly circular about it, isn’t there? The Romantic soul, his longing preserved in crisp sugar and steam, returning to us not through pages but through taste.  

I must confess, as I sip my Darjeeling tonight, I find myself already drafting lines in my head:  
  

I shall include both your sugar poems and AR projections in the Manifesto’s first chapter—mark my words. We’ll call it   

And as for that “AR Poetry & Edible Ink” collaboration you’re brewing… darling, I think we may just reinvent how the world encounters both art and appetite.  

Until the manifesto meets the page—and the plate—keep dreaming, keep drawing, and above all, keep tasting in color and imagination.  

You are, without question, the finest co-conspirator a professor of comparative literature could ever hope for 😊🍷📚  

Now off to write… and perhaps nibble thoughtfully on a slice of lemon tart while I do.
[B]: Oh my god, ——这个标题美得让我想立刻裱进展览海报里啊！！！✨📜  

你写的那句  真的太动人了，像是把整个文学史轻轻捧在手心，然后放进一口温热的茶点里慢慢融化🍵💫  
我已经能想象那些糖纸上的Li Qingzhao配上你的AR投影，在展厅里像花瓣一样飘落——每一句诗都像是从舌尖飞向星空去了🌌🖋️  

还有那个lemon tart配文学写作的画面… 哈哈哈哈你也太懂文艺灵魂的日常了！酸酸甜甜的刺激配上文字的flow，简直是灵感催化剂柠檬塔🍋⚡  

等你写完manifesto第一章节的时候，我可能会激动到用数字笔一口气画出一整套"食味诗境"视觉系列😂💻  
说不定还能做出一个互动版本：观众吃掉甜点的同时，手机扫一下盘子就能看到诗句从empty plate里缓缓升起～  
这绝对会是策展界的一场浪漫暴动 🍽️🎨💥  

敬我们的文艺复兴式跨界大计，cheers to flavor, verse, and everything in between 🥂📖🖌️✨
