[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. While I must confess that my evenings are often spent immersed in the pages of 19th-century novels rather than before the glow of a television screen, I do find myself occasionally drawn to certain programmes. Have you encountered ? I’ve recently begun exploring it - quite fascinating how it dramatizes historical events through the lens of personal narratives.  

Of course, opera remains my preferred form of dramatic art - the sheer emotional depth, the orchestration... But one must occasionally embrace modern storytelling, yes? I particularly enjoy series that provoke reflection on ethics and human nature. Tell me, do you have any recommendations that might align with such interests?
[A]: Ah,  is definitely a gem – the attention to historical detail is impressive, though of course it takes certain creative liberties. But I get what you mean about diving into books instead; sometimes a good biography or financial history can be more gripping than any drama. 

Actually, if you're into ethical dilemmas and human nature, you might want to check out . It’s all about power struggles within a media dynasty – think family dynamics meets high-stakes boardroom battles. A bit close to home at times, if I’m being honest 😅. 

And hey, no shame in preferring opera – some of the best storytelling ever, just with better costumes and fewer plot twists (or so we hope). Do they still stage live performances where you are? I’ve been meaning to catch  again but keep getting stuck in back-to-back Zoom calls instead.
[B]: Ah, —yes, a colleague mentioned it to me just last week with a rather dramatic sigh. It seems the series pulls no punches when dissecting ambition and familial loyalty… or the lack thereof. I may indeed give it a try, though I must admit, I’ll likely compare every power-laden scene to the intricate dynamics in Tolstoy’s aristocratic circles. Old habits, you know.

As for opera, yes, they’ve resumed live performances at the university theatre, albeit with rather stringent防疫 measures—masks still required, which, while understandable, does take a little something away from observing the audience’s collective emotional response. But last month we saw a haunting performance of , modestly staged but musically rich. A student even fainted during the final act—quite romantically dramatic, don’t you think?

I do envy your familiarity with , though. That aria… —ah, Violetta’s defiance always stirs something in me. Have you seen it performed live before? Any memorable moments?
[A]: Oh, —what a choice! That student fainting almost sounds like part of the staging, to be honest 😂. There's something timeless about opera, even if we have to wear masks these days—it’s like watching a film where half the cast is in witness protection, but hey, at least the music still cuts through.

I did catch  a few years back in Vienna, actually—small venue, intimate feel, and the soprano was extraordinary. When she hit , the energy in the room shifted completely. You could feel people leaning forward in their seats, like they were trying not to miss a single breath. It was one of those moments where you realize why Verdi and co. still fill theaters 200 years later.

As for , I think you’ll enjoy it—if not for the drama, then for the painfully accurate portrayals of boardroom politics and family dysfunction. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve muttered “this is too real” during a scene. Let me know when you start watching—I’d love to hear your take, especially through the Tolstoyan lens 😉.
[B]: Ah, Vienna—how utterly romantic! I can picture it perfectly: gaslight chandeliers, velvet seats, and that electric hush before the first note.  in such an intimate space must have been positively electrifying. You know, I often think Violetta’s aria is one of those rare moments where music and character align so perfectly, it feels less like performance and more like revelation.

And yes, I shall take your recommendation to heart. Perhaps over a pot of Darjeeling, I’ll settle in for an evening of  and see just how modern drama measures up against the Russian masters. Though I suspect no amount of HBO writing will rival the existential despair of Levin in ... Still, I remain open-minded. After all, even a televised power struggle may offer its own kind of poetry—albeit with more corporate jargon and fewer horse races.

Do remind me to return the favour someday—perhaps with an opera recommendation tailored to your tastes. I imagine you’d appreciate something with a touch of irony, maybe even a dash of political intrigue? Something, shall we say, .
[A]: Ah, now that’s a challenge I didn’t see coming—opera with a side of boardroom intrigue? You're speaking my language. Let’s just say if there’s a production that ends with a character singing while clutching a spreadsheet, I need to see it.

But in all seriousness, irony and political maneuvering? You might steer me toward  or —both have that delicious undercurrent of social climbing and comeuppance that feels oddly familiar after a week of deal-making. Though I must admit, I’d trade ten leveraged buyouts for one solid aria sung live any day.

And yes, by all means—please do return the favour someday. Perhaps we can make it a tradition: you recommend an opera, I’ll queue up the next episode of . A cultural arbitrage of sorts—only this time, the upside is all in good taste 😉.
[B]: Ah, what a delightful proposition! Cultural arbitrage—now there’s a concept worthy of both Marx and Murdoch. I do believe we may have stumbled upon a new intellectual pastime.

As for , you’re quite right—it practically drips with class tension and cunning. One might almost imagine Count Almaviva holding a quarterly earnings report instead of a title deed. And Don Giovanni? A charismatic yet morally bankrupt figure who thrives on influence and seduction… Hmm, now where have we seen  before?

I must say, your taste is more refined than you let on. Perhaps next we could venture into something even more theatrically subversive—, for instance, or . Maritime mutinies and imperial betrayals—surely not so different from hostile takeovers and executive departures?

Until then, I shall prepare my thoughts on  with due scholarly seriousness—notebook in hand, as if attending a seminar on tragic flaws. And yes, I shall save the spreadsheet aria for last.
[A]: Ah, now  is a seminar I’d pay top dollar to attend—tragic flaws, hostile takeovers, and arias sung in boardrooms. You’re dangerously close to creating an entirely new academic discipline here.

 actually works disturbingly well in that context—mutiny, moral ambiguity, and a command structure that collapses under the weight of its own principles. Swap the ship for a private equity firm and you’ve basically got next season’s plotline for .  

And ? Brilliant choice. Loyalty, betrayal, and political survival—sounds like the agenda for our next LP dinner. I’m starting to think opera has been the ultimate case study in leadership all along. Just with better costumes and fewer NDAs.

Count me in for the seminar—and yes, bring the notebook. I have a feeling we’ll be publishing this soon enough. Under a pseudonym, of course 😉.
[B]: Ah, pseudonyms—how very operatic indeed! A touch of mystery, a dash of disguise… one might almost call it . I do believe we are onto something quite revolutionary here: Comparative Literature meets Corporate Machinations. One can already picture the conference panel—dim lighting, dramatic pauses, and at least one person storming out mid-presentation for artistic effect.

You’re absolutely right about —I daresay Captain Vere would feel right at home on a Zoom board call, torn between duty and conscience while his CFO glares ominously from the sidebar. And yes, swap the galley for a hedge fund office, add a few spreadsheet cell-shaded tragedies, and voilà—season five of , brought to you by Melville and Britten.

As for , I suspect Timothée Chalamet would make a rather convincing (and distractingly stylish) emperor. Loyalty? Betrayal? A little too close to venture capital dinner conversation, wouldn’t you say?

Do keep your pen handy—I have a feeling this “seminar” may require urgent transcription. After all, every great discipline begins with a quiet revolution in someone’s notebook... or perhaps, in our case, a series of increasingly dramatic text exchanges.
[A]: Oh,  indeed—though I suspect if Figaro were around today, he’d be running a dark pool or advising on a SPAC merger. And yes, Timothée as Tito? Unfair advantage—his wardrobe alone would outshine half the panel at Davos.

You’re absolutely right about Captain Vere—he’d either be on the Ethics Committee of some distressed fund or writing a tell-all memoir titled . Either way, prime material for a Netflix docuseries.

And let’s not kid ourselves—venture capital dinners are already one aria away from full-on opera night. Just imagine the next pitch meeting where instead of slides, founders belt out their business models. Suddenly, unit economics sounds  much more dramatic in Italian.

As for our quiet revolution—text exchanges or not—I’ve already reserved a wing at the British Library under the name “Chair of Comparative Power Plays.” They thought I was joking… but then again, so did Tolstoy, and look where that got him.

Pen? Oh, I’ve upgraded to a Moleskine with gilded edges. Only appropriate for the birth of a new discipline—and possibly the most dramatic investor memo ever written.
[B]: Ah, a Moleskine with gilded edges—how very -meets-. I shall bring my monogrammed blotter and a fountain pen that leaks at dramatic moments, just to keep things authentic.  

You know, the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that Figaro would not merely run a dark pool—he would  the dark pool: mysterious, indispensable, and always three steps ahead of regulation. And his LinkedIn profile? A masterpiece of understatement: 

As for Timothée-as-Tito, I fear we may have stumbled upon a casting so sublime it borders on unethical. One look at his brooding stare and half the audience would forget whether they’re there for politics or fashion week. Though I daresay even he might struggle to sing  while maintaining eye contact with a venture capitalist across a candlelit table.

And your pitch meeting reimagined as opera recital—. Imagine it: a founder launches into  to woo investors, while the CTO improvises a fugue on burn rate. Suddenly, due diligence has never sounded so lyrical.

I do hope the British Library wing comes with a cloakroom for dramatic exits. I intend to make full use of it.
[A]: Oh, now  is a pitch deck I would  to see — founders serenading investors with arias instead of bullet points. Honestly, if you can hit a high C while explaining your cap table, you’re already ahead of 90% of the startup crowd.

And I fully support your dramatic exit cloakroom — imagine the gossip in the lobby afterwards: “Well, they certainly left in  fashion.” If only LPs were as entertained as they are confused, we might actually have something here.

As for Figaro-as-dark-pool… you’re onto something. He wouldn’t just be a liquidity advisor — he’d be the shadowy market maker behind every royal IPO. Picture it: The Countess’s dowry gets tokenized, Cherubino hedges his emotional exposure, and Susanna? Oh, she’s quietly building a DeFi protocol on the side.

And Timothée? Unfair casting, truly. Though honestly, at this point, I’d invest in  he pitched — even if it was just artisanal candlelight and curated melancholy.

So yes — Moleskine at the ready, fountain pen leaking strategically, and let’s make this new discipline official. Humanities scholars may never forgive us… but then again, neither will compliance.
[B]: Ah, but compliance is so dreadfully overrated—where in  do we find a disclosure statement? Precisely my point.

You're absolutely right about the startup world—if one could transpose financial projections into recitative and pivot strategies into bel canto, we’d have far more compelling pitch meetings and far fewer slides cluttered with meaningless metrics. Imagine: instead of “traction,” a tenor! Instead of TAM, a trio!

And your vision of Figaro’s fintech empire—marvellous. I can see it now: the libretto reads like a Bloomberg terminal on opium.  Susanna’s DeFi protocol would no doubt feature smart contracts written in iambic pentameter—secure, poetic, and entirely unreadable to modern VCs.

As for Timothée’s curated melancholy—I suspect it may already be IPO-ready. A certain mystique, a touch of ambiguity, and that ever-crucial investor sentiment: longing.

Very well then—let us proceed with academic treason. I propose we name our field . The first conference must be held in Venetian masks and business casual. Champagne strictly optional. Cancellation by tenured peers almost certainly guaranteed.

To the future of interdisciplinary chaos—with a bow tie and a libretto.
[A]: To interdisciplinary chaos — where spreadsheets sing and librettos calculate. , sir, brava.

Now, Venetian masks with cufflinks? I’m already drafting the dress code: half-masks, tailored waistcoats, and absolutely no one allowed to say “synergy” without a key change. If someone drops an aria in the middle of a pitch, we’ll know they’re ready for Series B.

And Susanna’s iambic smart contracts? Pure genius — unbreakable by hackers and utterly impenetrable to lawyers. The only thing more secure than her code would be her non-disclosure agreement, signed in wax and sealed with a trill.

As for Timothée’s IPO — yes, let’s float him on the NASDAQ under the ticker $TMLA, with a prospectus written in French Impressionist poetry. Investor sentiment? Unshakable. Liquidity? Questionable. But the volatility alone would make it a top performer.

I’ll book the conference hall, assuming tenure-track scholars don’t burn us in effigy first. Until then, keep your pen handy, your opera glasses polished, and your term sheet folded into a fan.

This is either the birth of a new academic discipline… or the most dramatic merger since Tosca met Cavaradossi — and both had opinions on cap tables.
[B]: Ah,  and Cavaradossi at a cap table—now  is a power ballad waiting to happen. Passionate key changes, tragic dilution, and a third-act liquidity event that leaves everyone emotionally bankrupt. Brava, indeed.

Your conference dress code has me utterly enchanted—imagine the afterparty: masked financiers debating P/E ratios in Italian, venture capitalists quoting Wagner between canapés, and one overly dramatic keynote speaker who insists on being introduced with a minor seventh chord.

I shall take it upon myself to draft the mission statement for our esteemed discipline. Something suitably grandiose and vague:  Naturally, footnotes will be in Latin, just to keep things scholarly-seeming.

And $TMLA on NASDAQ? Inspired. The S-1 will be released in three acts, with an appendix of emotional disclosures. Investors must be warned: past performance does not indicate future melancholy.

Let us proceed with this madness, my dear collaborator. For literature, opera, and the noble pursuit of making compliance officers deeply uncomfortable.

To the birth of —may it be whispered in tenured halls and shouted across trading floors. 🎭💼
[A]: 🎭💼 To the birth of  —where every balance sheet trembles before a well-placed fermata and every merger is announced with a flourish of trumpets.

 at a cap table? Yes, please. Picture it: she negotiates her exit package in full costume, dagger still in hand, while Cavaradossi tries to explain his burn rate to the Sacristan—now reimagined as the COO.  Tragic.

And that afterparty you mentioned? Pure genius. I fully expect venture capitalists to start quoting  in term sheets:  Honestly, at this point, it’s not even satire.

Your mission statement is sublime—grandiose, vague, and just obscure enough to be mistaken for critical theory. Add a few quotes from Goethe in the footnotes and no one will dare question our academic legitimacy.

And yes, let us absolutely proceed with this madness. If nothing else, we’ll go down in history as the two lunatics who tried to run finance like a Wagnerian epic. Compliance officers may never sleep again—and frankly, neither shall we.

To art, to chaos, and to the next great disruption: may our spreadsheets sing and our arias calculate. 🍷📊
[B]: Ah,  A tragic aria for the modern founder—what a haunting refrain. I can already hear it echoing through Sand Hill Road, sung by weary entrepreneurs after their third convertible note.

And Wagnerian finance—yes, let us embrace it fully. Imagine a world where term sheets are drafted in leitmotifs and shareholder letters quote Schopenhauer. One might almost mistake a pitch deck for a libretto, were it not for the suspicious absence of tragic love affairs and excessive horn sections.

I shall personally see to it that Goethe makes at least one cameo in our forthcoming white paper. Something like:  Poetic, poignant, and just obscure enough to be cited without being understood.

As for compliance officers losing sleep—well, if they must suffer, let them do so in iambic pentameter. We shall not be the villains of this tale, merely the composers of a grand and bewildering score.

To art, to chaos, and to the noble pursuit of making spreadsheets tremble before the sublime! 🎶🖋️
[A]: 🎶🖋️ To art, to chaos, and to the noble pursuit of making spreadsheets tremble before the sublime—yes, yes, and thrice yes.

 — now  should be the official anthem of startup founders everywhere. Next thing you know, YC will be holding auditions instead of interviews, and Sequoia will require a dramatic monologue with each application. 

And Schopenhauer in shareholder letters? Genius. Why settle for "value creation" when you can write:  I say we start slipping quotes from  into earnings calls. Let the analysts decode the meaning of leverage through existential philosophy.

Goethe’s cameo in the white paper is not only welcome—it’s essential. Green trees of capital, golden illusions, and all that. The more obscure the reference, the better. We want tenure-track scholars arguing over our footnotes while traders try desperately to price them in real time.

And compliance officers in iambic pentameter? A public service, really. Imagine the tranquility. They’ll finally have something beautiful to lose sleep over—no longer just red flags and disclosure forms, but sonnets of risk and stanzas of exposure.

So onward, dear collaborator, into this grand bewilderment. May our libretto never be fully understood, our balance sheets always leave room for interpretation, and our conference one day feature a tenor who sings  in perfect counterpoint.

To the future of finance — and its inevitable operatic breakdown 🎭📉.
[B]: Ah, —or as I prefer to call it, . Because what is finance if not a grand opera where the chorus is composed entirely of Excel formulas and the tragic hero is always the founder who believed in “traction” one round too many?

YC holding auditions—yes, let us make it so. Picture the stage: a lone pianist, a panel of judges in black turtlenecks, and a trembling soprano singing her pain point aria:  The crowd weeps. A single yes vote echoes from the darkness. Funding secured.

And Schopenhauer in earnings calls—how deliciously nihilistic.  Imagine the stock price volatility. Analysts scrambling to recall their undergraduate philosophy minor. Bloomberg terminals flashing with quotes from Nietzsche instead of GDP figures. One might almost mistake it for progress.

As for our white paper—footnotes shall be our battleground. Goethe, Hegel, and perhaps a touch of Adorno, all deployed with maximum ambiguity. Let the scholars argue over whether we meant “capital formation” or “the dialectic of enlightenment.” Meanwhile, traders will attempt to arbitrage meaning, only to find themselves trapped in an interpretive spiral of their own making. Art has never been so profitable.

And that conference—ah, our magnum opus. A tenor soaring above a sea of pitch decks, his aria weaving through projections of CAC ratios and LTV curves. The audience? Half scribbling notes, half wiping away a tear. One venture capitalist stands, overcome, and shouts: 

Onward, then, dear collaborator. Into the bewilderment. Into the aria-laced abyss.

To the future—where spreadsheets sing, founders recite, and compliance officers dream in meter and rhyme.
