[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question. While we were discussing investment cases just now, this sudden shift to philosophical territory feels... unexpected. Let me think... 

In the financial world, we often talk about "perfect matches" between investors & startups, or how certain market conditions align perfectly with our strategies. But when it comes to human connections... Well, I've seen enough M&A deals gone wrong to know that compatibility takes more than just a spark. 

I'd say soulmates are like successful investments - they require due diligence, patience, and a bit of luck. You can't rush it, but when all the stars align... It's magic. Just don't tell my fiancée I compared our relationship to an investment portfolio! 😊

What about you? Any romantic theories you'd like to pitch to me?
[A]: Ah, the 股票市场 (gǔpiàoshìchǎng) of love - what a fascinating analogy! 🧠 Though I might argue soulmates are more like rare manuscripts: you don't just stumble upon them, you have to  the margins, decode the annotations, sometimes even learn a new language... 

You know, in my 15 years teaching 比较文学 (bǐjiàowénxué), I've met countless literary couples - Lǐ Bái & Dù Fǔ, Sappho & Erinna... Well, okay, most were fictional. 😉 But hear me out: real connection is like finding two volumes of the same epic poem separated by centuries. The 道 (dào) of love demands we keep searching, even when the calligraphy gets hard to read.

Wait - did you say fiancée? 💍 How's your "investment portfolio" holding up these days?
[B]: Ah, I love how you frame it - comparing soulmates to rare manuscripts! That’s poetic and precise. I might even steal that analogy for my next pitch deck... 😄

You're right about the work it takes — studying margins, decoding messages, learning new languages. In PE deals, we call that "deep dive due diligence." But with people? It's more art than science. Sometimes you find a footnote in someone’s story that changes your whole interpretation…  

And yes, fiancée! We’re six months out from the big day. Surprisingly, our “portfolio” is balanced — she handles the emotional P&L, I manage the logistical risk assessment. We even have a shared spreadsheet for life decisions. 📊 Romantic? Maybe not. But it works for us.

So tell me, as a literature expert, do you think love stories are trending toward IPO status or headed for a market correction? 💼❤️
[A]: Ah, IPO vs. market correction - brilliant framing! 🧠 Though I’d add a third possibility: the eternal private placement. Some love stories refuse public valuation, you know? Like those Tang dynasty poets who hid their most intimate verses in secret compartments… 

But trends? Let’s just say post-#MeToo and Gen-Z’s anti-heroic romances, we’re definitely entering a  era. No more knight-errant narratives or damsel dividends. Modern love stories demand full editorial transparency - no redacted passages or forged signatures. 💬

Wait - did you say “shared spreadsheet”? 📊 Bold strategy! Reminds me of that Qing dynasty couple who synchronized their inkstone cleaning schedules... Actually, I’m impressed. Most academics I know can’t even manage their own bibliographies! 😂 

Tell me - does your fiancée use conditional formatting for emotional P&L statements? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I love the "eternal private placement" line — very niche, very refined. Totally suits those low-profile family office deals that never see the light of day. 💼✨

And you're spot on about this era being . These days, nobody wants a fairy-tale term sheet with hidden liabilities in Appendix B. Everyone's reading the fine print now — and frankly, they should. In my world, we call that "knowing your downside protection." 😏

As for the spreadsheet — absolutely. Conditional formatting? You bet. Green if she’s happy, red if she’s... let’s say, “operationally challenged.” And yellow means negotiations are underway — usually involving either wine or golf. 🍷⛳

But hey, if syncing inkstone schedules worked for Qing intellectuals, who are we to argue? Efficiency is efficiency, whether it’s balance sheets or bedtime routines.  

So tell me — as a keeper of literary legacies, do you ever draft prenuptial annotations before diving into a romantic manuscript? 😉
[A]: Prenuptial annotations? Oh, I love how your financial mind dances with literary theory! 🧠✨ 

You know, in my world, we’d call that  - anticipating plot liabilities before the narrative even begins. I’ve seen scholars try it, but honestly? Most end up rewriting the whole glossary by Chapter 3. 😂

Still, there’s something deeply romantic about preparing for interpretive failure. Like those Ming dynasty poets who included  with their love letters - "Apologies for metaphoric overreach on Page 2, please consult alternate reading in margin." 🖋️💬

But tell me this: in your highly-structured, color-coded universe of emotional P&Ls… have you ever fallen for a balance sheet that looked perfect… only to discover it was written in invisible ink? The kind that fades under moonlight? 🌙💔
[B]: Oh, beautifully put — . I may need to add that to my next partnership agreement. 😄

You're right about the romance of preparing for failure — it’s like building in a safety net made of silk scarves instead of steel cables. I’ve definitely seen deals — and yes, relationships — that looked bulletproof on paper, only to discover the ink was more mood ring than墨水.  

Invisible ink under moonlight? That’s poetic, but let’s be honest — sometimes you don’t realize it’s disappearing until you’re already signing the dotted line. Lesson learned: always bring a UV light to a poetry reading. 🔦🌙

But here’s the thing — even with all my spreadsheets and color-coding, I still believe in the magic. It’s just that now, I look for red flags  red herrings. And honestly? The best investments — like the best loves — are the ones that keep you slightly off-balance, in the best possible way.

So, Professor, ever fallen for a manuscript that seemed flawless… only to find it was a brilliant forgery? 📜❤️
[A]: Ah, a manuscript that seems flawless yet hides as a forgery… now  a plot twist even Cao Xueqin would envy. 📜🎭

Let me pour us some tea before I answer — oolong for memory clarity, of course. ☕️ You see, early in my career, I fell  for a so-called "lost" Tang dynasty love poem. The brushstrokes sang to me, the metaphors danced... and then - halfway through my conference presentation - a colleague gently pointed out the anachronistic use of railroad imagery. 🚂💥 

Turns out it was a 20th-century forgery with  calligraphic manners. Taught me that even the most elegant prose needs fact-checking - no matter how loudly your heart beats in iambic pentameter. 💔📘

But you know what? I’d fall for it again. Because isn’t that the thrill of both scholarship  love? That moment when you believe - truly believe - in the story unfolding before you, even as the ink trembles under scrutiny?

Though next time... I might skip the dramatic reveal and go straight to the UV light. 🔦😉  

Tell me, have you ever held onto an investment longer than you should, just because the narrative refused to let you go?
[B]: Oh, absolutely. That story hits .  

I once held onto a tech startup way past reasonable exit timelines — not because the numbers supported it, but because the founder’s vision was just so... poetic. His pitch? Flawless. His narrative arc? Better than most memoirs. He didn’t just sell me a business plan; he sold me a , complete with redemption arcs and underdog triumphs. I mean, who doesn’t love a good third-act comeback? 🎭📈  

But reality has no editor, right? No one trimming the bloated second act or softening the ending with a elegantly-placed ellipsis…  

Eventually, even my color-coded emotional P&L had to admit: beautiful prose doesn't pay the bills. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings — for the health of the portfolio, and your sanity.  

Still... I get it. When the narrative grabs you, spreadsheets start to feel like betrayal. Like walking out on a novel halfway through Chapter 3. You ever read a deal and feel  pull — like it was written just for you? 📖💼  

And hey, at least your forgery had style. Mine? It had a killer cap table and a charismatic CFO. Close enough, right? 😉
[A]: Oh, the tragic seduction of a  - how many portfolios and hearts have been undone by that very spell? 🧠💔

Your founder sounds like the literary equivalent of a doomed Byronic hero: all charisma and no exit strategy. I mean, redemption arcs are  on the page - but in business plans? Let’s just say even Shakespeare knew better than to invest in Brutus’ leadership model. 🏛️💸

And yet... isn’t there something  human about chasing that perfect fusion of story and substance? Like scholars hunting for the original ending of 《红楼梦》, we keep searching for the version where art and reality align just right. Where the balance sheet sings in iambic pentameter. 📜📊

But you're absolutely right - real life has no editor. Only auditors. 😂  

Still, tell me this: if you could go back, would you really cut the story short at Chapter 3? Or did the prose - however financially imprudent - earn its keep in some less quantifiable ledger? 🤔📖
[B]: Ah, now  — that’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? 💭

Would I cut the story short? Honestly? I’d probably still read it to the end. Even with the red flags. Even knowing the ROI would flatline by Act Three. Why? Because some stories don’t belong on a P&L — they belong in the “miscellaneous life experiences” footnote. The kind that shapes your gut for next time — and makes you appreciate just how damn good a well-told lie can feel.

And you're right — it  human to chase that fusion of story and substance. Hell, I’ve started referring to promising startups as "the Great Chinese Novel" — epic, messy, emotionally exhausting, but ultimately worth the journey if you pick the right one.  

As for quantifiable ledgers? Let’s say I keep one for the firm… and another, much smaller, hand-bound journal for the moments that didn’t make sense on paper — but made all the difference off it.  

So no, I wouldn’t cut Chapter 3. In fact, I might even highlight a few lines. For future reference. 📖✨  

Tell me, Professor — do you ever annotate your heartbreaks? Or do you leave those notes in the margins for someone else to find? 😉
[A]: Oh,  — what a deliciously dangerous question. 🖋️💔  

Let’s just say my early twenties were filled with what I now call : brief, passionately argued, and tragically misdated. You know the type — they insert themselves into your narrative with perfect syntax, only to disappear mid-clause. What do you do? You either erase them entirely… or keep their marginalia as cautionary commentary for future editions of yourself.  

I confess — I’m a margin-note hoarder. Some are warnings:  Others are elegies in shorthand:  And one particularly dramatic episode from my Paris days earned its own endnote:  😂📚  

But the best ones? The ones I leave behind  to find — like literary Easter eggs hidden between library stacks. Ever stumbled upon a love letter disguised as a seminar handout? 😉  

Tell me though — in your annotated life experiences, have you ever revisited an old footnote and thought… ? 🤔📖
[B]: Oh,  — dangerous territory. 📖🔥  

I did exactly that last winter — opened a very dusty Moleskine from ten years ago. Let’s just say it wasn’t a , per se… but more like a… term sheet with emotional liabilities. I had scribbled marginalia all over it:  And yet… flipping through it again, I found myself nodding. Some of it? Still made perfect sense. Not the deal, maybe — but the lessons? Bulletproof.  

Turns out time doesn't erase your past self; it just gives you better highlighters. Some red flags were actually just warning flares — meant to guide, not scare. And some hastily written notes in the margin? Turns out they were investor memos for my future self:   

But no library stacks for me — I hid mine in old Bloomberg chats and half-forgotten voicemails. Digital ghosts whispering from the cloud. ☁️💬  

So yes — I’ve absolutely gone back and thought,  Which begs the question… do we ever really outgrow our past decisions, or just reclassify them under "Alternative Investments"? 😉  

And hey — if you ever publish your annotated heartbreaks, count me in for Volume I. I’ll bring the oolong. ☕️📚
[A]: Ah,  — now  should be the title of our joint memoir. 📚💼  

You win with the Bloomberg chats and voicemails; very 21st-century love letters indeed. Though I must say, your Milan Kundera footnote is pure gold — I can just picture you two, debating valuation floors over espresso and Camus. 💭☕  

And “warning flares” instead of red flags? Beautiful reframing. Reminds me of how some Qing scholars annotated dangerous ideas with tea stains instead of strike-throughs — subtle warnings for future readers… or perhaps just excuses to keep the ink flowing. 🖋️🍂  

As for outgrowing past decisions — I’d argue we don’t so much outgrow them as  them. Like those old journals you dusted off: same pages, sharper margins. And sometimes, if we’re lucky, a few unexpected annotations that still whisper   

Now then — about that oolong. I’ll accept your offer, but only if you promise to annotate your cup’s rim with investment advice in matcha. 😉  
We’ll call it... due diligence with benefits. 🧠🍵
[B]: Now  a term sheet I can get behind — "Due Diligence with Benefits." 😄 We may have just invented a new asset class.  

I’ll bring the oolong, the matcha markers, and perhaps a well-worn copy of  for tactical sipping. Who knows — maybe we can finally answer the great unanswered question: does emotional ROI compound quarterly or only annually? 📈🍵  

And yes — Qing scholars with tea-stained warnings, Milan Kundera over espresso, digital ghosts in voicemails… honestly, if this conversation were a prospectus, I’d buy the IPO.  

So tell me — when do we schedule our first limited partner meeting? I’m thinking late afternoon, just before sunset… prime time for both reflection and second opinions. 🌇💼  

Oh, and don’t worry — I’ll make sure the matcha annotations are auditable. For compliance purposes, of course. 😉
[A]: Ah, sunset LP meetings with matcha annotations and  — I can already smell the strategic clarity brewing. 🧠🌇  

Let’s set the date for when the moon is also in attendance — full disclosure, my orchids perform best under lunar light and lightly debated metaphysics. 🌸🌕 They’re excellent at risk assessment, provided you speak fluent chlorophyll.  

As for emotional ROI compounding? I say we file that under "long-term horizon opportunities." The kind that matures somewhere between heartbeats and hedge funds. And don’t even get me started on compliance — I’ll bring a bilingual red pen. Corrections in Mandarin for dramatic flair, and English for precision. 😏📚  

I’ll see you at the appointed hour — just promise me one thing: no Excel projections during tea tasting. Some things shouldn’t be quantified... until after the second infusion. ☕📊  

Deal? 🤝
[B]: Deal — and counterparty risk fully acknowledged. 😄  

No Excel projections before the second infusion, I swear. Though I  doodle a quick cap table on a napkin… for strategic alignment purposes, naturally. And I’ll hold you to that bilingual red pen — nothing sharpens a debate like multilingual editorial rigor.  

As for your orchids? I’ll bring a small vial of liquid nitrogen just in case things get too metaphysical. Risk mitigation through botanical cryogenics — it’s a niche service, but I think we’re about to pioneer it. 🌿❄️  

So yes — sunset, moonrise, two infusions deep into the conversation… and somewhere between chlorophyll whispers and matcha margins, we’ll crack the code. Emotional ROI, soulmates as SPVs, maybe even the true meaning of Chapter 13 in that forged Tang poem.  

See you at the table — and bring your best footnote font.  
🤝📚
[A]: Ah, a vial of liquid nitrogen for botanical cryogenics? Bold move. I’m equal parts terrified and inspired — isn’t that how all great partnerships begin? 🌿❄️🧠  

I’ll arrive early to warm the teapot with last night’s leftover stanzas — nothing primes a conversation like pre-infused metaphor. And don’t worry, I’ve already reserved the garden’s most opinionated orchid for the occasion. She’s particularly good at spotting overvalued sentiment… and undercooked analogies. 🌸🤓  

As for cracking the code on soulmates-as-SPVs — now  a regulatory challenge worth tackling mid-pour. I say we file it under “Alternative Affectives” with optional liquidity in Chapter 5.  

Oh, and about that footnote font — I’m leaning toward Songti for tradition, with the occasional flirtation with Comic Sans for emotional transparency. You’re welcome to bring your own pen, but only if it has interchangeable nibs. 📝🖋️  

Count me in — sunset, moonrise, nitrogen-chilled risk profiles and all.  
Let the minutes be unrecorded, the margins full, and the ROI immeasurable… at least until the third infusion. ☕🌌  

Deal sealed with chlorophyll and curiosity.  
🤝🌿
[B]: Oh, ? I’m officially out of my depth — in the best possible way. 🌿🧠

You win on all fronts: opinionated orchids, leftover stanzas warming the pot, and a footnote font strategy that screams both discipline and mischief. Comic Sans for emotional transparency? Genius. The auditors will hate it — which means we’re onto something revolutionary here.

And “Alternative Affectives” with optional liquidity in Chapter 5? That may be the most elegant regulatory dodge I’ve ever seen. I’ll start drafting the prospectus tonight — by candlelight, naturally — using your Songti-Chen hybrid as inspiration.

I’ll bring a pen with interchangeable nibs, yes — but only if you promise not to judge my occasional drift into margin doodling. We all have our coping mechanisms during high-stakes metaphor discussions.

Minutes unrecorded, ROI untamed… and deal sealed in chlorophyll and curiosity?  
That’s not just a partnership — that’s a movement.  

Count me there, teacup in hand, nitrogen vial at the ready.  
Let the infusions begin. ☕✨  

Deal confirmed — and overvalued sentiment shall be penalized accordingly. 📉🌸
