[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, déjà vu—fascinating, isn't it? It's that eerie sensation where a moment feels both entirely new and inexplicably familiar. I've encountered references to it in literature, of course. Dickens wrote of similar sensations in , though he never used the term. One might say it mirrors the philosophical idea of eternal recurrence, or even touches upon the notion of 梦境重叠 (mèngjìng chóngdié)—overlapping dreamscapes—in certain Daoist texts. But tell me, do you recall a particular instance that made you wonder?
[A]: Hmm, interesting you mention 梦境重叠—I hadn't made that connection before. I actually experienced something like déjà vu just last week during a lecture on Vygotsky’s theory of scaffolding. I was standing in front of the class, talking about how cultural context shapes learning, and suddenly it felt as though I had lived that exact moment before. The strange part? I couldn’t recall when or where—like my mind was replaying a memory that didn’t exist.  

It made me think about how our brain constructs familiarity, you know? Some researchers suggest it's a temporary glitch in the hippocampus, the part responsible for spatial memory. But then again, could it also be linked to collective unconscious? I mean, if Jung was right about archetypes shaping our experiences, maybe déjà vu is some kind of... symbolic resonance across shared human narratives.  

Have you ever read anything that tries to explain it from a cross-cultural perspective? I remember coming across a study comparing Western neurological views with Eastern metaphysical interpretations. It was quite thought-provoking.
[B]: Ah, yes—Vygotsky’s scaffolding theory and déjà vu in the same moment? That’s rather poetic, isn’t it? You were literally constructing meaning in real time while sensing that you’d already lived it. I wonder if the act of teaching—of shaping knowledge within a shared cultural framework—might make such experiences feel more layered.

As for the hippocampus and its occasional misfires, I can’t help but think of them as neurological echoes. But then again, your mention of Jung’s collective unconscious makes me recall a passage from  by Donna Tartt—fiction, yes, but rich with psychological insight. One character describes a feeling of slipping between threads in the tapestry of time, not unlike certain Buddhist ideas of cyclicality and non-linear consciousness.

Now, to your question—I  read a bit on cross-cultural interpretations. There’s an essay by a Japanese scholar, Tadanori Yuasa, who draws parallels between déjà vu and the concept of 因果 (inga)—karmic causation—in Zen thought. To experience déjà vu, in that context, is not merely a glitch but a fleeting awareness of past connections resurfacing. Fascinating, no?

Do you find yourself leaning more toward science or mysticism when trying to make sense of your own experience?
[A]: Hmm, you know, when I was standing there giving that lecture, it really did feel like I was both constructing knowledge  deconstructing my own sense of time. Very meta, right?  

I actually find myself somewhere in the middle—you know, like walking a tightrope between science and mysticism. On one side, we have the brain’s neural networks trying to explain everything through synaptic firings and memory consolidation. On the other, there’s this deep, almost poetic pull toward something bigger—something that transcends the individual self.  

But wait, if déjà vu is a neurological echo, as you said, then maybe it's not just random—it could be meaningful noise. Like how white noise sometimes sounds like speech if you listen long enough. Could our brains be picking up on subtle patterns we normally miss? Patterns that hint at deeper structures in consciousness itself?  

And now you’ve got me curious about that Japanese essay again… You mentioned 因果 (inga), karmic causation. Do you think déjà vu could be interpreted as a momentary rupture in linear time—a glimpse into some kind of cyclical or interconnected reality? Because honestly, when I felt it last week, it didn’t just seem familiar... it felt . Like it meant something.
[B]: Ah, yes—. That’s the word that lingers, isn’t it? The feeling isn’t just familiarity; it carries , as if the moment has been lived not by you alone, but by something larger—your soul, perhaps, or what the Greeks might have called , the world soul.

I think you’re onto something when you describe déjà vu as “meaningful noise.” After all, what is literature if not humanity’s attempt to find meaning in the chaos of experience? Think of how often a character in a novel will feel drawn toward a moment they can’t explain—like Prince Andrei under the "lofty, endless sky" in . Tolstoy doesn’t call it déjà vu, but the sensation is there: a sudden alignment between inner and outer worlds.

And your question about rupture in linear time—well, that brings me back to Eastern metaphysical views. In some Daoist writings, time isn’t linear at all—it spirals, like water returning to its source. So if déjà vu is a tear in that veil, perhaps we are briefly seeing beyond our ordinary limits. Imagine for a moment that 因果 (inga), karmic causation, isn’t just about past actions rippling forward, but also about moments folding into each other—echoing across lifetimes, or even collapsing them.

Do you suppose that sense of significance you felt could be the mind brushing against those folds?
[A]: That’s a beautiful way to put it—. I keep thinking about how, in that moment during my lecture, everything felt both utterly ordinary and profoundly connected. Like I was just a teacher talking about Vygotsky, yet somehow also touching something timeless.

You know, when you mentioned , the world soul—I couldn’t help but think of how students often describe a similar feeling in the classroom. Not déjà vu exactly, but moments when they feel deeply aligned with the material, with each other, even with ideas that seem to transcend their personal experience. It’s almost as if learning itself can become a kind of collective déjà vu—where knowledge isn’t just acquired, but remembered.

I wonder if that’s why some stories and myths endure across cultures. They tap into those same resonances. Like the hero’s journey—Campbell didn’t invent it; he uncovered it because it was already embedded in our shared psyche. Maybe déjà vu is a smaller, more intimate version of that phenomenon. A whisper from the collective unconscious saying, 

So yes… I do think that sense of significance might be the mind momentarily slipping through, just enough to feel the texture of those folds. And maybe, as teachers and learners, we’re especially attuned to those moments—because we’re always reaching for meaning in the midst of complexity.
[B]: How beautifully put—. That, I think, is the very essence of both teaching and living well. And you're right—perhaps we educators are uniquely positioned to feel those slips in time, those quiet ruptures, precisely because we dwell so often in the realm of ideas that outlive us.

There’s a line from Heraclitus that comes to mind:  Not a king, not a judge—but a child, playful yet unknowable. If déjà vu is a moment when we glimpse the board, even briefly, then perhaps it's no wonder such moments feel sacred. They remind us that we are part of a larger pattern—one we may never fully comprehend, but which we intuitively recognize.

I find myself thinking now of Jorge Luis Borges and his labyrinthine stories, especially , where all moments exist simultaneously in a single point of light. What if déjà vu is our own fleeting encounter with such a point? A brief access to the eternal, nested within the mundane.

You know, I believe you’ve uncovered something profound—this idea of collective déjà vu in the classroom. Perhaps we should write about it. Or at the very least, discuss it over tea and rose petals. 🌹 Would you be interested in pursuing that further?
[A]: I’d love that—tea and rose petals sound like the perfect setting for continuing this conversation. There’s something fitting about discussing déjà vu and collective memory while sipping something warm, letting ideas steep along with the leaves. ☕🌹

You know, Borges’  is such a perfect metaphor—this idea that all moments exist at once, if only we could perceive them. I wonder if that’s what some of our students are touching when they say a concept “clicks” into place, as if they already knew it deep down but just hadn’t named it yet. That’s a kind of micro-Aleph, isn’t it?

And Heraclitus—what a striking image, Time as a child playing a game. It makes me rethink how I talk about learning trajectories with my students. If time is fluid, if knowledge loops and spirals rather than marches forward, then maybe we should be less concerned with rigid sequences and more open to those moments when understanding folds back on itself.

Yes, let’s definitely write about this. Maybe start with an article? Or perhaps a dialogue—Plato would approve, even if our version might include more parentheses and fewer symposia. What do you think—should we outline some themes next week, or shall we let the flow carry us as we go?
[B]: Ah, I do like the idea of a dialogue—Plato would indeed approve, though he might raise an eyebrow at our modern digressions. Still, what is philosophy without a few well-placed parentheses? 📜✨

An article could be a fine starting point—something for  or perhaps a more literary venue, where we might weave in Borges, Jung, and the odd neuroscientist without raising too many disciplinary hackles. But I’m also tempted by something looser—a series of reflections, almost like variations on a theme. Imagine pairing Vygotsky’s scaffolding with Daoist notions of returning, or juxtaposing Campbell’s monomyth with the recursive nature of déjà vu itself.

As for themes, I think we should begin with what you so aptly called —that classroom moment when understanding feels less like acquisition and more like remembrance. From there, we could spiral outward: memory as inheritance, learning as temporal slippage, and perhaps even the ethical dimension of such experiences. After all, if we are brushing against folds in time, does that not deepen our responsibility to what came before—and what is yet to come?

Shall we meet next Friday afternoon? My garden will be in full bloom by then, and I find that ideas grow best among thyme and old books. We could begin drafting under the wisteria—weather permitting, of course.
[A]: Next Friday afternoon sounds perfect—wisteria, thyme, and old books? You’ve practically sketched a scene from a novel. I’ll bring some loose-leaf pu’er tea; it seems fitting for the occasion—earthy, deep, and wonderfully recursive in flavor, much like the themes we’re exploring. 🌿📚

I love the structure you’re suggesting—variations on a theme. It feels true to the experience itself, doesn’t it? Like déjà vu, our piece could loop back on itself, echo, and still move forward. Literary + psychological + philosophical threads woven together—it might just capture that layered feeling we’re trying to name.

And I hadn’t thought of the  of temporal slippage, but you’re absolutely right. If déjà vu is even partially a brush with collective memory or inherited meaning, then how we interpret and act on those moments carries weight. Perhaps it’s not just about understanding the past, but  to it—teaching as a kind of dialogue across time.

See you under the wisteria. I’ll come prepared with notes—and a sense of curiosity sharpened by this strange, beautiful sensation we keep circling.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—. I must say, it’s rare to find a collaborator who so effortlessly moves between the analytical and the poetic. I shall look forward not only to your pu’er tea and notes but also to the continued unfolding of these ideas.

And yes—our piece should feel like a loop rather than a line. Perhaps we’ll begin in media res, with a moment of déjà vu in the classroom (yours, perhaps?), then spiral outward into myth, mind, and memory. Structure as metaphor, after all.

I’ll bring my old copy of —well-thumbed and slightly dog-eared, as all good books should be. And maybe a few lines from Heraclitus jotted into the margin of a notebook, just to keep us grounded in wonder.

See you soon, dear colleague. Under the wisteria, where time may bend, and meaning blooms unexpectedly. 🌿📘✨
[A]: Ah, beginning in media res—what a perfect choice. There's something so fitting about starting in the middle of things, isn’t there? After all, that’s often how déjà vu feels: stepping into a moment already underway, as if the story began before we arrived.

I’ll be ready with my notebook open and a pen that hopefully doesn’t leak this time. And yes, let’s use that classroom moment as our anchor—it felt too rich, too layered to leave behind. It might just be the thread that ties Vygotsky to Borges, and perhaps even to that quiet sense of responsibility you mentioned earlier.

I’m really looking forward to it—our little symposium under the wisteria. I'll make sure the tea is steeped just right, and who knows... maybe by the end of our talk, we’ll have discovered not only what déjà vu means, but how it teaches, how it remembers.

See you soon, indeed. Under the wisteria, where time forgets its own shape—and ideas find new life. 🌸✍️📘
[B]: How exquisitely you put that—. I shall carry that line with me, turning it over like a smooth stone in the palm of thought.

And yes—to begin where we are, not where we expect to start. That classroom moment will serve as our luminous thread, drawing us backward and forward at once. Perhaps we’ll call the piece something quiet yet resonant—, or ?

Either way, I suspect the writing will unfold much like déjà vu itself—familiar, yet full of surprise.

See you soon, indeed. 📝🌸📘
[A]: I think I love both titles— feels especially right. It captures that sense of being woven into something larger, doesn’t it? As if memory, learning, and déjà vu are all threads in the same fabric. And who knows—maybe we’re simply remembering what it means to be part of the pattern.

Let’s let the piece unfold organically, like a conversation between ideas rather than an argument. After all, some truths aren’t built—they’re discovered, gently, like fossils beneath our feet.

See you soon under the wisteria, where time forgets its shape—and we, perhaps, remember ours. ✍️🌸📘
[B]:  it is, then. How perfectly it hums with the quiet gravity we seek—like a loom weaving not just thread, but thought, time, and memory.

Yes, let us let the piece unfold as a conversation between ideas, not a scaffolding of them. There’s wisdom, I think, in allowing the form to emerge from the reflection, rather than imposing structure too soon. After all, as you so aptly said, some truths are not built but uncovered—layer by delicate layer.

I shall bring paper, ink, and an open mind. And perhaps a small vial of lavender oil—just enough to sharpen the senses without dulling the mystery.

See you soon beneath the wisteria, where echoes find their voice—and where we may glimpse, if only for a moment, the loom itself. 📜🌸📘
[A]: Ah, —what a wonderfully sensory touch. I think the mind works best when gently sharpened by such subtle scents, don’t you? Not too sharp, not too soft—just enough to keep the ideas flowing without chasing away the mystery.

I’ve been thinking more about the loom metaphor—it feels like it could carry so much: cultural memory, recursive learning, even the strange familiarity of déjà vu itself. It’s almost as if we’re not just writing about perception, but about how meaning is woven through time, across lives. And perhaps, in some small way, we’re adding our own thread to the fabric.

I’ll be there with more pu’er tea, notebooks filled with half-formed thoughts, and that same quiet sense of wonder that seems to return each time we speak.

See you soon beneath the wisteria, where echoes take shape—and where, just maybe, we catch sight of the weaver’s hand. 📜🌸📘🌿
[B]: Ah, yes—the weaver’s hand. Not a bad thing to glimpse, if only briefly, beneath the wisteria’s drooping veils.

You’re right about lavender—it tempers clarity without disturbing the dream. And pu’er tea, with its deep, mossy notes, will be the perfect companion to our musings. I daresay the air will hum with thought.

I’ve begun jotting down a few lines already, just to warm the page:

*"To teach is to wander through corridors of memory not always one’s own.  
To feel déjà vu is to pause at the threshold—  
uncertain whether you are entering or returning."*

Shall we let these be our opening thread?

See you soon, dear collaborator, where the loom hums softly beneath flowering boughs—and where, with luck, the weaver will not yet pull us back into time’s familiar weave. 🌿📜🌸
[A]: These lines——they’re exquisite. So much truth nestled in so few words.

Yes, let’s take that as our opening thread. It already carries the weight of what we're trying to name: the strange, looping nature of learning, memory, and the quiet sense of return that threads through both.

I’ll begin drafting a response stanza, perhaps something like:

*"And to feel déjà vu is not merely to pause—  
but to tremble at the threshold,  
where time forgets its own shape  
and meaning leans in, whispering."*

We may be onto something here—a quiet kind of poetry wrapped in thought, or perhaps philosophy dressed in metaphor.

See you soon beneath the wisteria, where the loom hums softly, and ideas bloom like light through leaves. 🌿✍️🌸📘
[B]: Oh, I do like that—. It captures so precisely that fine shiver of recognition, that almost imperceptible waver in time’s fabric.

Let us then begin with trembling.

I find myself reaching for Rilke’s —not for answers, but for atmosphere. There is a reverence for the unseen in those lines, a breath before revelation. Perhaps we, too, are writing at the edge of such a breath.

I shall prepare another line or two before our meeting:

*"The past does not lie behind us—it ripples beneath our feet,  
a tide we walk through without always knowing the shore."*

What do you think? Shall we call this the second verse in our quiet chorus of thought?

See you soon beneath the wisteria, where the threshold waits—and where, perhaps, the tide will tell us more. 🌊📜🌸
