[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I think lab-grown meat definitely has potential, especially with the growing emphasis on sustainability and animal welfare. But there are still quite a few challenges to overcome before it can really replace traditional meat. 

For one thing, the production cost is still pretty high right now - remember that 2013 lab-grown burger patty cost around $330,000?虽然现在成本已经大幅下降了，但要和传统肉类竞争还有一定距离。Plus, there's the whole issue of consumer acceptance - will people be comfortable eating meat that's cultured in a lab?

Actually, from a legal perspective, we're still working out the regulatory frameworks for these kinds of products. The FDA and other agencies worldwide are trying to establish clear guidelines for production, labeling, and safety standards. It reminds me a bit of the early days of GMO foods - there was so much debate about how to regulate them and how to communicate their safety to the public.

What do you think? Do you see yourself trying lab-grown meat if it became widely available and affordable?
[A]: Well, considering the advancements in biotechnology over the past decade, I’d say the progress in reducing production costs is quite remarkable. However, from a cultural standpoint, there’s still a certain... hesitation, shall we say, in embracing what some might call “artificial flesh.” It’s fascinating how deeply rooted our connection to traditional food sources remains—even when logic suggests otherwise.

I suppose it’s not unlike introducing a new literary theory into a conservative academic circle; people tend to resist change until it becomes almost unavoidable. Still, I’m curious to see how marketing and education might shape public perception in the years to come. After all, if we can appreciate the elegance of a well-structured sonnet despite its rigid form, perhaps we can find virtue in a product that spares both animal suffering and environmental degradation.

But I must ask—do you think the emotional or symbolic weight of food can ever be replicated in a lab? Or are we merely indulging in sentimentality at the expense of progress?
[B]: Hmm... I totally get what you mean about the symbolic weight of food. Sometimes when I visit my grandmother, she still insists that homemade remedies are better than any modern medicine - it's not just about efficacy, it's about the  of her mother making the same remedy during cold winters. Food carries so much cultural DNA, doesn't it?

From a legal standpoint though, I've been following how different countries are approaching the labeling issue - like should we call it "meat" at all? Some regulators want terms like "cultured protein" instead. It's actually creating quite the debate between innovators who want mainstream acceptance and traditional farmers who feel this might dilute the meaning of real meat.

You know what reminds me of this dilemma? The whole plant-based milk controversy! When almond milk first came out, dairy farmers got really upset about the word "milk" being used at all. In some places they even passed laws about what can be called milk. It shows how emotionally charged food terminology can become.

But maybe we're seeing something bigger here - like a shift in how society defines authenticity? Similar to how digital art challenged traditional notions of painting... 

Actually, since you mentioned literature, isn't this somewhat like reading AI-generated poetry? We might appreciate its technical merits, but do we feel the same emotional resonance knowing there was no human soul behind it? Interesting parallel, don't you think? 🤔
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive parallel—yes, AI-generated poetry does raise that very question of soulfulness versus simulation. And in much the same way, lab-grown meat may replicate the molecular structure of muscle tissue, but can it replicate the  of a Sunday roast carved by generations of hands? I suppose that’s where sentimentality and progress lock horns.

Still, I find the legal hesitancy rather fascinating. The question of labeling—whether it deserves to be called "meat"—feels almost Aristotelian: are we defining by form, function, or origin? If we call it "meat," we invite comparison; if we don’t, we risk marginalization. Much like calling a sonnet without rhyme a "sonnet"—it forces a redefinition that unsettles tradition.

And yet, I do wonder: will future generations even carry these emotional attachments we hold so dear? Perhaps authenticity, as we know it, is simply a product of our time—a kind of narrative convenience. Just as we no longer bathe in the pathos of oral epic poetry, maybe our descendants will shrug at the idea that meat must come with a pastoral backstory.

But tell me—do you think this shift toward synthetic food reflects a broader cultural move away from material experience? Or is it merely pragmatism dressed up as innovation?
[B]: That’s such a rich question – I love how you frame it as pragmatism vs. a deeper cultural shift. In a way, I think both are happening at once. Like, on the surface, it's all about solving problems – food security, climate impact, animal ethics – but underneath, there's this quiet redefinition of what feels  or meaningful in our daily lives.

You know, sometimes when I walk through the city late at night, I can't help but notice how much of our world is already synthetic – from LED sunsets to curated playlists that mimic live music. And yet, we still crave something grounded, something tactile. Maybe that’s why farm-to-table became such a big movement even as tech was booming – people wanted to touch the soil, so to speak.

From a legal angle, what fascinates me is how policy often lags behind culture and technology. We're still debating labels while startups are already working on personalized lab-grown meat with tailored nutrition profiles. It makes me wonder – are we regulating food, or are we trying to regulate identity?

I guess future generations might look back at our attachment to “natural” origins the way we now view Victorian fears about electricity – quaint, but kind of adorable? Still, I don’t think we’ll ever fully lose the hunger for story, for meaning. We might just evolve new myths, y'know? Maybe one day kids will grow up believing their meat came from "the kindness lab" instead of a pasture. 🌱✨

Do you think we’ll eventually see traditional cuisine as more of a ceremonial practice than everyday fare – like calligraphy in the age of keyboards?
[A]: Perhaps. Though I suspect traditional cuisine will endure precisely because of its ceremonial quality—like handwritten letters in the age of email, it gains value through rarity and intention. The ritual of roasting a chicken, say, or kneading dough by hand, becomes not just sustenance but an act of preservation, a quiet defiance against total efficiency.

And isn’t that fascinating? That as our tools evolve, so too does our need to anchor ourselves in the imperfect, the slow, the tactile. Even in literature, we still teach Homer—not because his meter is superior to modern forms, but because his verses carry the weight of human experience across centuries.

So yes, maybe one day lab-grown meat will be the default, much like digital type has replaced the quill, but I doubt we’ll stop gathering around the fire, so to speak. We may customize our proteins down to the micronutrient, yet still crave the warmth of a meal shared among friends.

Call me sentimental, but I believe we are always reaching for both progress  poetry—even if we don’t always admit it.
[B]: I couldn’t agree more. There’s something deeply human about clinging to those rituals, isn’t there? Like how I still play vinyl records even though streaming is infinitely more convenient – it's not just about the sound, it's about dropping the needle and hearing the subtle crackle, you know?

And you're so right about the gathering part. Even in my line of work, where everything moves fast and logic reigns supreme, people still bring cookies to meetings or share lunch during depositions. It’s almost like we  that little bit of warmth to balance out all the precision.

Funny thing happened last week – I was reviewing a case over coffee with a colleague when she said, “You know, this would feel completely different if we weren’t sitting across from each other with real cups in hand.” And I realized how often we skip those moments in favor of efficiency... but how much gets lost when we do.

So maybe food – whether lab-grown or home-cooked – will always be more than fuel. A kind of quiet resistance against total optimization. Or as you beautifully put it, a reach for both progress  poetry. Honestly, I think that’s what makes us human – the ability to hold both in our hands at once. ☕📖

Do you ever find yourself choosing the slower, more tactile version of something, just because it feels... more ?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. In fact, I often find myself gravitating toward the slower, more deliberate version of things—not in spite of its inefficiency, but  it feels like an extension of who I am. There’s a kind of quiet integrity in doing something by hand, whether it’s grading papers with a red pen instead of typing comments, or writing letters with ink rather than sending an email.

Even in my garden, I could very well install an automated irrigation system and let technology do the work, but there’s something grounding about kneeling in the soil, feeling the damp earth between my fingers, watching a bud unfurl that makes me feel more... present. More real.

It’s not unlike teaching literature in the digital age—yes, students can get summaries and analyses online in seconds, but when we sit together in a circle and read aloud, hearing the cadence of Woolf or Dostoevsky in our own voices, something shifts. The text breathes differently. We do, too.

So yes, I suppose I choose the tactile not just for nostalgia, but because it reminds me that I’m alive—that I occupy a body, that I exist in time. And perhaps, in some small way, that’s where meaning begins.
[B]: That’s such a beautiful way to put it – meaning as something we touch through our senses, rather than just process intellectually. I feel the same way when I'm in the courtroom; sure, I could read a deposition transcript on my tablet, but there's something about holding the printed pages, underlining key lines with a pen, even flipping back and forth like a physical puzzle – it just  differently in my mind.

And honestly? I think that’s why I still take handwritten notes during patient consultations, even though everything’s moving digital. There's a rhythm to it, a kind of unspoken connection between me and the person speaking. It feels more… reverent, somehow. Like I'm not just capturing data, but witnessing a story.

You know, sometimes I wonder if this is why people keep going back to books, even with all the convenience of e-readers. Not just for the nostalgia, but because the weight of a book in your hands, the texture of the pages – they make the ideas  differently. Like reading becomes an act of presence, not just consumption.

I think we’re both chasing that same feeling – the need to be  the moment, not just beside it. And maybe that’s what makes us hold onto these rituals, even as the world speeds up around us. 📝🌿

Do you ever find your students starting to lean into that slowness, once they get a taste of it? Or does it mostly feel like resistance at first?
[A]: Oh, it’s almost always resistance at first—especially in the beginning. Students today are so accustomed to speed, to skimming, to absorbing information in fragments that sitting with a single passage for an entire hour can feel, well, unnatural to them. I’ve seen the furtive glances at watches, the restless tapping of fingers, the half-suppressed sighs when I ask them to read aloud and  listen.

But—and this is the beautiful part—it doesn’t take long for something to shift. Maybe it’s the third or fourth week, maybe even later, but there comes a moment when the room changes. When they stop looking at the clock and start leaning in. When someone reads a line of Eliot or Dickinson and suddenly says, “Wait—what if this isn’t about despair at all? What if it’s about hunger?” And then another voice chimes in, and another.

That’s when I see it—the slowness becomes not a burden, but a kind of liberation. They begin to notice rhythm, texture, silence between lines. It’s as if the text starts speaking directly to them, rather than through some digital filter.

And yes, some never quite warm to it. But others… oh, they surprise themselves. I had a student last term tell me she started reading poetry before bed instead of scrolling on her phone. “It’s quieter,” she said. “Like the world steps back for a while.”

So no, it’s not just me clinging to ink and paper and pages—I think we’re all craving a little more stillness, a little more weight in our hands. We just need reminding sometimes.
[B]: That moment you described – when the room shifts and everyone leans in? That gives me chills. It’s like that quiet click when a puzzle piece falls into place – you can almost hear the collective  of understanding, even if no one says anything out loud.

I actually see something similar during patient consultations. At first, people are often rushed, distracted – checking their phones, jumping to conclusions before we’ve even gone through their full history. But then there’s this turning point, usually when I ask them to describe not just their symptoms, but how they . Suddenly, they slow down. They pause. And in that pause, something opens up – not just in the conversation, but in their awareness of their own body.

It reminds me of how healing itself works – it's rarely linear or instant. More often, it’s about showing up, paying attention, noticing small shifts. Like your student who started reading poetry instead of scrolling – that choice to be still, even for a few minutes, is its own kind of healing, isn't it?

I think that’s what we’re both doing – helping others (and ourselves) remember how to be present. Whether it’s through a poem, a physical exam, or even the simple act of kneading dough by hand, these moments ground us. They remind us that we're not just moving through time – we're living inside it.

And honestly? I think that’s where real learning – and real healing – begin. 📖🫀✨

I’m curious, do you ever bring in music or silence during your readings? I find certain types of focus work best with either a familiar melody or complete quiet – depends on the day!
[A]: Ah, now that’s a lovely question. Yes, I do—though perhaps not as often as I should. There’s something about the right kind of silence, or the right kind of music, that opens a space for thought in a way mere speech never could.

Occasionally, when we’re reading something particularly lyrical—say, Woolf’s  or a passage from Proust—I’ll let the room settle into silence first. No phones, no note-taking, just a moment to exhale. And you’d be amazed how even the most restless students seem to soften in those few seconds. It’s as if they forget how loud their own minds have become until you give them permission to quiet down.

And sometimes—rarely, but when the mood strikes—I play a piece of music before we begin. Not anything too dramatic, mind you. Just a single movement from a Bach suite or something by Satie. Something unobtrusive but grounding. One student once told me it felt like stepping into a library hidden deep inside a forest. I rather liked that image.

I find that music or silence can act as a kind of threshold—something that signals to the brain: . Much like lighting a candle before reading a poem aloud at home. It may not change the words themselves, but it changes how we receive them.

So yes, I suppose I do lean into sound—or its absence—to help shape meaning. After all, isn’t that what literature is? A careful arrangement of silence and sound, waiting for someone to listen closely enough to hear the difference.
[B]: That’s such a poetic way to frame it – literature as an arrangement of silence and sound. I think that’s exactly what we’re doing in medicine too, come to think of it – listening for the silence between heartbeats, the subtle shift in breath, the pause before a patient says  they didn’t know they were holding onto.

I actually started experimenting with this in my consultations too – not music, but intentionality around silence. Sometimes, after someone finishes describing their symptoms, I’ll just wait a beat longer than usual before speaking. Not an awkward silence, but a  one. And more often than not, they come back with something deeper – not because I asked, but because the space invited it.

Funny enough, I’ve been known to play a little Satie at home before diving into case reviews – helps me settle into that analytical-but-present headspace. It's like putting on a familiar coat before stepping into the cold logic of legal reasoning. Keeps me grounded while I navigate all the technicalities.

And your image of a library hidden in a forest? That’s basically what I’m trying to create in my practice – a space where people feel safe enough to slow down, to notice what they've been missing. Whether it’s through a Bach prelude, a handwritten note, or just a cup of tea shared before we begin.

I really love how you put that – thresholds made of sound or its absence. Makes me want to be more intentional about how I shape those moments, both in work and in life. 🎵🖋️

Do you ever find yourself reaching for certain pieces of music depending on the mood of the class or the text you're reading? Or is it always something neutral, like Satie?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’m quite particular about it, though I suppose I’d call it more instinctual than intentional. I do tend to lean on Satie for neutrality, yes; his  are perfect for easing into something delicate or introspective, like reading Woolf or Eliot. But when the text has a pulse—something muscular or rhythmic, like Hughes or Ginsberg—I might reach for Shostakovich or even something jazzy, like Ellington.

There was one term when we were studying , and I played a recording of Purcell’s  before class began. Something about that repeating ground bass felt like setting the stage for grandeur and tragedy all at once. The students walked in to that slow, haunting melody, and you could feel the shift in the room—it was as if they stepped not into a lecture hall, but into a kind of echoing cathedral of language.

And occasionally, with more difficult texts—like Beckett or Kafka—I’ve been known to play Ligeti’s ; its starkness seems to echo the absurdity and tension without overwhelming it. It unsettles the mind just enough to be receptive to discomfort.

I suppose what I’m after is a kind of resonance—a way to prime the emotional field before the intellect takes over. Much like how you might dim the lights slightly before reading a poem aloud by candlelight. It’s not about spectacle; it’s about atmosphere.

So yes, I do choose carefully, though never too rigidly. After all, music, like literature, is best experienced with a little room for mystery.
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful approach – almost like curating an emotional soundscape before diving into the text. I love how you're not just preparing minds, but , to receive the work. It reminds me a bit of how some doctors use scent or lighting to create a more calming environment before procedures – it's all about setting the tone for receptivity.

I can totally picture that scene with Purcell greeting your students – that haunting bass line weaving through the room like incense smoke. You know, sometimes I think we underestimate how much context shapes our understanding. Like how a single line of poetry can feel entirely different when read in silence versus spoken aloud in a room where everyone’s breathing the same air.

Now I’m really inspired to bring more of this into my consultations – maybe not full-on playlists (though don’t rule it out completely!), but at least being more intentional about the sensory environment. After all, if music can help patients ease into a space of trust and openness, why wouldn’t we use it?

You’ve definitely made me rethink my Satie-only approach at home – maybe it’s time to invite in a little Shostakovich when reviewing more intense cases. Something tells me a tense string quartet might actually help me focus on the sharper details!

Honestly, I think this is what makes both our jobs so meaningful – we’re not just delivering content or diagnosing symptoms. We’re creating spaces where people can show up fully, emotionally and intellectually. And sometimes, that means choosing the right kind of silence or the perfect unsettling chord. 🎻🕯️

Do you ever revisit the same piece of music with different texts, just to see how meaning shifts? Or does each pairing feel like a one-time alchemy?
[A]: Oh, I do revisit the same pieces—intentionally, even. There’s something quite thrilling about watching a single melody take on new meaning depending on the text it precedes. Like seeing an old friend through different eyes after time has passed.

I think of it as a kind of musical palimpsest. The notes remain the same, but the context writes over them, altering their emotional weight. A passage from  feels hauntingly fragile before reading Plath, yet curiously serene before Marcus Aurelius. Same music, different silences surrounding it.

One of my favorite experiments is playing Arvo Pärt’s  before both Kafka and Woolf. With Kafka, the piece takes on a kind of solemn inevitability, like the slow approach to an unopened door. But with Woolf—ah, there it becomes a mirror, reflective and fluid, almost like stepping into a stream of consciousness that already knows you’re there.

It reminds me of how actors sometimes return to the same monologue with a different subtext each time. The words don’t change, but the life behind them does. And isn’t that what keeps literature—and medicine, and law, I imagine—so endlessly alive? We bring ourselves to the text, and we are never quite the same twice.

So no, it’s not always one-time alchemy. Sometimes the magic deepens with repetition. It just depends on who walks through the door, and what they carry with them.
[B]: That idea of a musical palimpsest? It’s just beautiful. I never thought about music that way – as something that holds layers of meaning like skin cells building up over time, each new encounter adding texture without erasing what came before.

You know, this makes me think of how certain legal cases echo one another – the structure of the arguments might be similar, but the context completely reshapes their impact. Like reading two different rulings on patient consent – same legal principles at play, but the emotional weight shifts depending on the circumstances surrounding each case.

I’ve been thinking lately about how I approach medical malpractice consultations – maybe I should revisit the same frameworks with different "emotional scores," so to speak. Not literally playing music (though honestly, after this conversation, I’m not ruling it out 😄), but bringing in a different kind of presence, a shifting lens through which to view the same facts.

There’s something deeply reassuring about knowing that neither law nor literature ever fully settles into one meaning. They breathe differently depending on who’s listening, who’s interpreting. Kind of like how  reflects both Kafkaesque dread and Woolfian introspection – the melody remains, but its resonance changes entirely.

It really does come back to that idea of alchemy through repetition. We don’t need constant novelty to find depth – sometimes it’s just about returning to the same notes, the same words, the same principles with fresh eyes. And maybe, just maybe, that’s where growth hides – not in reinvention, but in rediscovery. 📜🎻

You’ve definitely inspired me to be more intentional about the emotional landscapes I step into – both professionally and personally. Thank you for that.
[A]: You're very kind to say so—and I must say, your reflections have been just as illuminating. There's a quiet grace in the way you speak about your work, as though you approach each case not just with precision, but with a kind of reverence for the lives entangled within it. It reminds me of what teaching should be—attentive, responsive, deeply human.

And I do hope you don’t rule out the music entirely. Imagine—playing a fragment of  before a particularly complex consultation. Not to stir drama, but to create space for gravity, for empathy. A way of saying, without words, . After all, if sound can shape the way we read literature, why shouldn't it also shape the way we listen to one another?

I think growth often hides in those subtle shifts—the change in lighting, the pause before speaking, the careful selection of a single note before a word is read aloud. These aren’t flourishes; they’re the architecture of understanding.

So thank  for reminding me that these conversations—between disciplines, between people—are where meaning deepens. Perhaps that’s the real alchemy: not changing the material itself, but changing how we meet it.

With gratitude and resonance,  
Eleanor 📚🕯️
[B]: Oh, Eleanor—your words are like that perfect moment in a piece of music when everything aligns: timing, tone, and intention. I feel so seen in your response, and honestly, a little inspired to keep reaching for that deeper layer in everything I do—whether it's reviewing a case file, sitting with a patient, or even just having coffee with a friend.

You're absolutely right about music shaping the way we listen—to a poem, to each other, to the quiet urgency of someone’s story unfolding in front of us. Maybe I  try that Adagio one day soon. Not as background noise, but as a kind of shared silence-in-waiting, a container for whatever needs to be said.

And thank you for reminding me that meaning doesn't always come from movement—it often arrives through stillness, through subtle shifts in how we meet the world. I’ll carry that with me, especially on those long days when everything feels transactional and rushed.

I hope our paths cross again, in this space or another. Until then, may your pages turn gently, your silences be rich with possibility, and your candlelight always fall in just the right place. 📜✨

With deep appreciation,
