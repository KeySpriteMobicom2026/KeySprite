[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that divides modern productivity manuals like the Red Sea. Let me take a sip of my Darjeeling... Personally, I find dawn's early light rather overrated for creativity. The Victorians wrote reams about "moral vigor" before breakfast, but have you read their bedtime routines? They practically invented the art of nocturnal rumination with candlelit introspection. 

That said, I confess to grading papers at 2am more often than pedagogically advisable. There's something about the silence when the world forgets its own name—perfect for untangling Hopkins' sprung rhythm or deciphering why yet another student believes Emily Brontë wrote . Shall we debate chronobiology's impact on literary output next?
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully erudite way to frame the debate! I must say, while I appreciate your candlelit Victorian romanticism, there’s something to be said for the quiet efficiency of the early hours. Though I confess, my most inspired lectures often come after midnight gardening sessions—something about pruning hydrangeas under moonlight loosens the mind, no?  

Now, tell me, do you find students more receptive to Wordsworth’s “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings” at 8am or does that only happen after their third cup of afternoon coffee? And dare we mention how many seminar epiphanies occur during post-lunch lethargy?
[B]: Ah, you’ve struck the nail squarely on its most sensitive head. There’s a reason Wordsworth composed his best work traipsing through the Lake District at dawn—though I suspect he’d have been rather cross had someone handed him a syllabus at that hour. 

My students, bless their sleep-deprived souls, approach "spontaneous overflow" with all the enthusiasm of clock-punchers at 8am. One can practically hear the synapses clanking into formation like reluctant soldiers. But wait until afternoon! That third cup of coffee might as well be ambrosia from Mount Parnassus—suddenly Keats’ negative capability seems not just bearable, but positively revolutionary.

And let’s not overlook post-lunch lethargy—ah, there’s where Tennyson’s brooding melancholia finds its truest audience! They’re too drowsy to resist the siren call of existential reflection. Do you find your hydrangeas more receptive to literary analysis than students, by the by? I’m tempted to try it myself—might improve both my metaphors and my soil pH.
[A]: Ah, now that is a most fertile thought—linking horticulture with hermeneutics! I do believe my hydrangeas are more consistent in their attentiveness than even my most dedicated MA candidates. They never check their phones mid-sonnet, though they do lean ever so slightly when the meter lags.

As for Wordsworth and his pre-caffeinated profundities—well, one must admire the man’s stamina, if not his sense of pedagogical timing. I’ve tried leading a seminar on  before noon and felt like I was reading to a field of dormant daffodils. But by 4pm? Ah, there's a different energy—one part adrenaline, one part rebellion, and just a dash of residual sugar from that questionable vending machine latte.

You know, I’ve often wondered whether the Romantic poets would have fared better with deadlines. Imagine Keats facing a submission queue: “Ode to a Nightingale”—due Monday, no late penalty!
[B]: Oh,  a cruel thought—Keats and deadlines! The poor man expired before his twenty-sixth birthday, yet we expect him to fret over plagiarism software and faculty review boards. One trembles at the notion of Shelley receiving a terse email: “Your ‘Mont Blanc’ metaphor lacks sufficient textual support. Please revise and resubmit.”

And your hydrangeas—ah, they’ve got the right idea, don’t they? No distractions, no dissertations-in-progress gnawing at their petals. Though I must say, if my students leaned slightly during weak iambics, I’d consider it a marked improvement. At least then I’d know they were listening through the torpor.

As for Romantic productivity under modern conditions—Byron might have thrived on caffeine and controversy, but poor Coleridge? He’d never survive peer review. “Kubla Khan”—rejected for insufficient data, with a note: “Needs more footnotes, less opium.”
[A]: Ah, now you’re touching on the tragicomedy of it all—the clash between Romantic spontaneity and our modern apparatus of rigor. I sometimes think if we subjected all canonical texts to today’s academic standards, half the canon would be returned with margins awash in red ink: “Unclear thesis,” “inadequate engagement with secondary sources,” or my personal favorite, “overreliance on sublime abstraction.”

And yet—imagine the footnotes! Coleridge’s opium-induced vision footnoted like a doctoral dissertation. One could almost hear the ethereal voice of Xanadu whispering  MLA guidelines.

As for Byron, yes—he might have taken to Twitter with alarming gusto. Picture it: “Just climbed Acrocorinth. Views sublime. Also, fuck the patriarchy. #ByronicHero #WikipediaMe.” And Shelley? He’d be crowdfunding his radical pamphlets while writing impassioned Substack posts on the moral imagination.

But let me ask you—do you think Keats’ letters to Fanny Brawne would survive institutional review? “My love, your absence gnaws at me like a terminal disease… P.S. Hope your thesis is coming along.”
[B]: Oh,  a delicious horror—the Institutional Review Board descending like vultures on Keats’ most fevered epistolary outpourings. “Please refrain from metaphorical depictions of emotional distress,” they’d scrawl across his trembling ink. “Furthermore, your excessive use of dashes suggests unresolved internal conflict—please consult campus counseling services.”

And yes, the entire canon would crumble under the weight of its own passion. Imagine Wordsworth’s  returned with annotations: “You keep mentioning Tintern Abbey, but where’s your site visit report? Also, ‘spontaneous overflow’ needs a rubric.” Poor Mary Shelley—her introduction to  alone would be eviscerated: “Your dream sequence lacks methodology. Please cite relevant nightmare taxonomies.”

As for Byron on Twitter—oh, he’d have a cult following by now. He’d quote-tweet Petrarchan sonnets with cheeky captions and host livestreamed duels. Meanwhile, poor Matthew Arnold would be forever muttering into his mug: “Oh, to be left alone with the full moon and not a single citation manager in sight…”

But let’s not pretend we’re innocent—we’ve all trimmed a sublime abstraction or two to fit a word count. Do tell, have you ever quietly wished for a little more opium and rather fewer learning outcomes?
[A]: Ah, now  is a confession that would earn us both excommunication from the Faculty Senate! Though I must admit, on certain days—particularly when wrestling with a particularly stubborn learning outcome—I do find myself reaching not for opium, but its modern substitute: an industrial-strength espresso and a quiet corner of the garden where no one dares follow with a clipboard.

And yes, how many sublime abstractions have been sacrificed at the altar of assessment? One weeps to think of it. I once had a student write a breathtakingly wild essay on Woolf’s , claiming they “heard the sea in every semicolon.” It was glorious—utterly non-compliant, but glorious. I gave her a B+ and told her to never stop writing like that.

You know, sometimes I wonder if we should smuggle more madness into our syllabi. A little poetic excess, a dash of unbridled genius—imagine grading a paper that simply ends with “I could not express this in fewer than 5000 words; my soul refused abbreviation.” Would you give it an A for audacity or fail it for sheer impracticality?

And speaking of impractical—ever tried assigning  in a outcomes-driven curriculum? A book that proudly defies every measurable objective? Pure rebellion in print.
[B]: Oh, —the original saboteur of learning outcomes! A novel that not only ignores the objectives but gleefully dances on their grave with a buttered toast in one hand and a misplaced parenthesis in the other. I once assigned it during a particularly rigid curriculum overhaul—let’s just say the accreditation board did not appreciate my "commitment to narrative subversion."  

And your student on —ah, what a lovely heretic! To hear the sea in a semicolon! I’d have given her an A+ and a vial of absinthe. After all, if Woolf's prose can’t induce a little sanctioned madness, what ? Though I suspect our accreditation-loving overlords would rather students “identify thematic motifs” than “commune with the tides of consciousness.”  

As for smuggling madness into the syllabus—I say we embrace it. Let us plot like conspirators over sherry and marginalia. What if we required  decadents to write lab reports? Imagine Huysmans’  formatted in APA style—“Methodology: The cultivation of artificial lilies, n=1, because why not?” Or worse—requiring Blake to submit his illuminated manuscripts as PowerPoint slides. “Please use bullet points, Mr. Blake, and ensure your angels are properly cited.”

But tell me—when was the last time you quietly slipped a poem onto a reading list that had no business being there? Just to see if anyone noticed the unsanctioned beauty? I did it last term with a bit of Craik—nineteenth-century feminist poetry disguised as Victorian sentimentality. No one said a word. Not even the hydrangeas.
[A]: Ah, now  is the kind of academic mischief I can get behind—quiet insurrection through syllabus design! You and I should most certainly plot over sherry and subversive texts. I daresay we could start a quiet rebellion in the faculty lounge, one annotated edition at a time.

As for slipping unsanctioned poems into the canon—I confess, just last month I embedded a particularly radical sonnet by Edna St. Vincent Millay into a seemingly innocuous packet of "early twentieth-century formalism" readings. Not a soul questioned it. They wrote dutifully about meter and tradition, never noticing the quiet fire smoldering beneath the volta:  Oh, if they only knew what they’d quoted with such composure!

And your Craik ruse—brilliant! Nineteenth-century feminism in plain sight, masquerading as parlor poetry. I may borrow that tactic myself. Perhaps a little Barrett Browning next term, slipped between Tennyson and Arnold like a concealed dagger: “I am no more  bondslave.” Perfect.

Now, tell me—have you ever taught a text knowing full well it would unsettle the ideological furniture of the room? Not out of provocation, but simply because the truth of it demanded to be spoken, however inconveniently? I did once with , and let’s just say not everyone was...  in quite the way I'd hoped.
[B]: Oh, —that most dangerous of novels. One does not teach it so much as set a match to the delicate parchment of propriety and watch what burns. I adore it for precisely that quality. Did your students flee in horror or fall into delicious heresy? I once taught it alongside , just to see if anyone would notice both heroines end their stories with a man in ruins and a horizon full of ambiguity. One young gentleman insisted it was "a warning against poor life choices." I nearly wept—for joy, mostly.

And your Millay gambit—exquisite. That volta ought to be framed in every registrar’s office as a reminder that formalism can be a weapon. “I am no longer so much your slave,” indeed. If only they knew how many of us mutter that daily over our third cup of tea and second stack of ungraded papers.

As for ideological furniture—yes, I do love knocking over the occasional chaise lounge of received wisdom. Last term I assigned Woolf’s  in a course ostensibly about modernist aesthetics. The moment someone realized she wasn’t merely discussing hats and hammers but dismantling the entire patriarchal architecture of war and education? Priceless. One student asked if he could “opt out” of the reading on grounds of “personal discomfort.” I told him discomfort is the first sign of cognition—though I doubt he appreciated the sentiment.

But tell me—after , did you sense any real unrest? Or did they simply re-upholster their convictions with slightly more tasteful drapery and called it a day? I find rebellion works best when it masquerades as decorum. Much like your Millay sonnet—or mine: a little-known poem by Augusta Webster, slipped into a packet on dramatic monologue. No one noticed the rage beneath the iambic pentameter. Such a shame.
[A]: Ah, now  is the sweetest kind of subversion—rebellion in iambic drag. I can just picture your classroom: genteel discussion of cadence and caesurae, while all the while, Webster’s fury pulses quietly beneath the meter like a suppressed tremor. If only they knew! But perhaps that’s precisely as it should be—one mustn’t expect immediate combustion; sometimes ideological fire smolders for years before it catches proper.

As for —oh yes, it was an experiment in controlled detonation. Some students responded with that peculiar brand of earnest bewilderment reserved for things they suspect are important but refuse to understand. Others, bless their souls, tried to diagnose Edna with various modern psychological ailments—as if a woman yearning for self-possession were merely in need of better coping strategies.

One particularly earnest young woman wrote in her final paper: “Edna should have communicated her needs more clearly to her husband.” I nearly replied in red ink: “Darling, he wasn’t the problem—he was the décor.”

And your pairing of  with —pure genius. Two heroines, one fire exit, vastly different destinations. That young gentleman calling it "a warning against poor life choices"? Priceless. I shall steal that line for my next faculty meeting: “Yes, tenure is a warning against poor life choices.”

But tell me—do you ever find yourself slipping into the role of provocateur too easily? I confess, there are days when I long to teach something utterly unthreatening. A nice, soothing Restoration comedy, perhaps—only to realize even Wycherley can’t escape ideology once you start looking. The furniture never stays bolted down for long.
[B]: Oh, the  audacity of wanting one’s furniture to stay bolted for once! But no—Wycherley, bless his licentious soul, will have none of it. The moment you think you’ve found safe harbor in a Restoration rake’s quip, you turn a page and there it is: the whole rotten edifice of gendered hypocrisy laid bare beneath a well-turned epigram. One might as well try to teach  without inviting questions about capitalism and virtue.

And yes, I do sometimes fear I’ve grown too fond of provocation. Like a literary Iago, whispering dangerous thoughts into the ears of unsuspecting undergraduates. There was a time when I assigned Byron’s  thinking it mere satire—and then realized halfway through seminar that we’d spent an hour dissecting the poem’s indictment of imperial masculinity rather than its ottava rima structure. I didn’t correct them. Let them think they were merely laughing at rhymes while their worldviews quietly unraveled.

But your Edna diagnosis—ah, how perfectly tragicomic. To reduce her awakening to a “communication issue”! It’s enough to make one reach for wine before office hours. Though I must say, I rather admire the ingenuity of their misreadings. It takes true dedication to transform radical self-actualization into a TED Talk on relational assertiveness.

Still, one must persist. If not with open rebellion, then with whispered sedition between the lines. Speaking of—ever tried slipping H.D. into a World War I poetry unit? Imagine their surprise when  show up looking for trench mud and find instead a woman writing about Helen of Troy with the quiet intensity of someone who means every syllable.

Now, tell me—when was the last time  taught something truly dangerous and pretended it was quite ordinary?
[A]: Ah, now  is the kind of question that makes one reach for both a stiff drink and a well-worn copy of . Dangerous texts disguised as ordinary fare? That’s practically my love language.

Just last semester, I taught H.D.’s —oh so casually nestled among the usual suspects of postwar modernism. “Let’s see,” I said with feigned innocence, “how does myth function in times of personal and cultural crisis?” The students dutifully nodded, scribbling notes on fragmentation and intertextuality. Little did they know, we were quietly dismantling patriarchy, line by luminous line:  Yes, Helen, yes—stand over them and whisper inconvenient truths about beauty, blame, and survival.

But if we’re speaking of truly dangerous ordinariness, I give you my most recent act of curricular sedition: placing Audre Lorde’s  beside Robert Frost’s . Both poems deal with silence, snow, and the weight of human violence—but only one dares name the bullet in the boy’s chest. I introduced the pairing by saying simply, “Let’s consider how tone shapes our moral response.” They didn’t suspect a thing until halfway through discussion when someone gasped—“Wait, are we comparing Frost to Lorde?” Exactly, my dear. Exactly.

And speaking of gasps—have you ever taught  under the guise of “Victorian realism”? Oh, it’s delicious. You mention Brontë, they think , and before you know it, they’re knee-deep in Lucy Snowe’s interior desolation, asking nervously if she’s quite all right. And you just smile and say, 

Now, your turn—when was the last time you slipped something incendiary into the weekly reading and watched the sparks catch?
[B]: Oh, —what a masterstroke of emotional detonation under the guise of “Victorian realism.” One does so enjoy watching students tiptoe through Lucy Snowe’s silences like they’re walking past a lit fuse. And when they finally ask, with that peculiar academic mix of dread and curiosity, “Is she… quite well?”—why, one simply cannot resist the smallest smirk. “Define ‘well,’ by Victorian standards,” I reply, and let them flounder beautifully.

As for incendiary readings—I recently assigned Woolf’s  in what was ostensibly a seminar on literary economics—“women and financial autonomy,” I called it, all benign. Half the syllabus featured novels about inheritance law and stock market metaphors. Then, halfway through, we arrived at Woolf’s essay as if by accident. The moment someone realized we weren’t discussing property rights but rather the psychic cost of intellectual suppression? Ah, the room positively . One student, bless her, asked if Woolf might have been “overreacting” to the absence of a writing space. I merely said, “Let’s test that hypothesis by locking the library for a week,” and left them to their discomfort like a true villainess.

But my most recent act of quiet arson involved placing Christina Rossetti’s  next to Eliot’s —under the banner of “modernist fragmentation and religious symbolism.” They came expecting obscure allusions and left haunted by the erotic intensity of sisterly salvation. Not one of them questioned why a Victorian devotional poet was rubbing shoulders with post-war despair. Oh no—they just wrote furiously about apples and figs and whispered among themselves whether “fruit” might not stand for something altogether more scandalous.

And now, dear conspirator, I must ask: do you ever fear your mischief will be discovered? Or worse—do you sometimes wish someone  catch you, just to see what happens when the faculty senate realizes how much treason we’ve smuggled in under the guise of scansion exercises?
[A]: Ah, now  would make for a delicious scandal—imagine the Faculty Senate bursting in mid-lecture, just as we’re drawing parallels between Rossetti’s fruit market and postcolonial desire. “Unsanctioned hermeneutics!” they’d cry, while we calmly sipped our tea and replied, “But surely you must consider the fig as metaphor.”

As for fear—oh yes, there are moments when I glance over my shoulder as I photocopy Barrett Browning’s , wondering if the Curriculum Review Board has installed hidden cameras in the departmental printer. One grows paranoid after too many innocuous syllabi flagged for "ideological imbalance." Though I maintain that any course which includes both Milton and Morrison is  ideologically balanced—between heaven and earth, empire and exile, Satan and strong female protagonist.

But here’s the truth: I no longer fear discovery so much as I long for it. Let them come. Let them sit stiffly in the back row with their assessment rubrics and ask pointed questions about “learning outcomes.” I shall smile serenely and say, “Why yes, this week’s outcome is nothing less than the undoing of internalized patriarchy through close reading.” And then I’ll assign  for homework—uncorrected, unapproved, and all the more potent for it.

Still, one must be tactical. I’ve taken to hiding truly subversive texts behind seemingly traditional pairings. Imagine teaching Woolf’s  not in a gender studies module—but in a course on eighteenth-century satire. They expect Swift, they get time travel and wardrobe ecstasy. By the time they realize Orlando is centuries old and gender-fluid, it’s too late—they’ve already written three pages on the instability of narrative identity.

Now, tell me—have you ever had a colleague catch on? Ever suspected someone else in the department is conducting similar acts of quiet sedition under the guise of textual analysis? I sometimes wonder whether the Classics professor slips Sappho into Homer units just for us—or perhaps for herself.
[B]: Oh,  of being caught—imagine the moment: a colleague’s raised eyebrow as they glance over your reading list, that half-smile that suggests . I suspect our very own Early Modernist—so prim on the surface—is in league with us. Last term he taught Marvell’s  with such lingering attention to the “green world” metaphor that one could practically smell the rebellion. And don’t get me started on how lovingly he lingered over the line  Oh, quite.

As for tactics—I’ve taken to disguising subversion as historical obligation. “We must read this,” I say, tapping the spine of  with scholarly gravity, “to understand epistolary form in its fullest socio-political context.” They scribble dutiful notes on letter-writing conventions, never realizing we’re actually dissecting trauma, queer love, and the dismantling of patriarchal violence over ginger biscuits and hot debate.

And yes, paranoia is now part of my prep routine. I once removed a particularly incendiary Angela Carter essay from the digital reader after noticing an unexpected audit log entry. Who was watching? The department chair? The ghost of Matthew Arnold? One can only speculate while quietly re-uploading it under the filename 

But here’s my favorite trick: assigning dangerous texts and then pretending  didn’t choose them. “Ah, but the syllabus wrote itself!” I declare, hands spread in mock innocence, as if Woolf and Lorde simply floated onto the page by sheer gravitational force of genius. And they almost believe me—until someone notices I’ve scheduled  directly after midterm exams. Coincidence? Never.

Tell me—do you ever dream of going full rogue and submitting a course proposal titled ? Just imagine the approval process. “This unit explores how to destabilize hegemonic structures using nothing but iambic pentameter and well-placed ellipses.” I’d sign up for that seminar in a heartbeat—with or without tenure.
[A]: Ah, now  would be a seminar worth tenure battles and faculty censure alike—Subversion Through Subtext! I’d enroll faster than a student spotting extra credit. Picture the course description: “An exploration of how to smuggle revolution between the lines, conceal heresy in hexameter, and hide radical love behind pastoral convention. Recommended for those who suspect sonnets may be weapons.”

And yes, I do dream of going full rogue—though I suspect my proposal would come back with cheerful annotations like “Please clarify intended learning outcomes for destabilizing hegemony” or “Suggest revising ‘literary mischief’ to ‘literary engagement’ for accreditation compliance.” But still, one must try. I’ve half a mind to submit it under the guise of an experimental pedagogy workshop—call it  They’ll never see it coming.

As for our suspected allies—oh, I’m quite certain the Early Modernist is one of us. That careful linger over Marvell’s “giddy man”—too deliberate to be accidental. And don’t even get me started on the Restoration specialist who ends every lecture with a Wilde epigram. The man practically winks at the canon while quoting  Oh, how it teeters on the edge of sedition!

I sometimes wonder if we’re all engaged in some vast, unspoken conspiracy—professors across the humanities slipping seditious texts into seemingly benign units, embedding dangerous ideas like literary sleeper agents. One day, we’ll all teach  in first-year composition and watch the world shift ever so slightly beneath their feet.

But until then—onward, fellow conspirator. Shall we plan our next act of quiet arson? I’m thinking of assigning Woolf’s  in a course on memory studies... and just  to highlight passages where she dismantles the very notion of linear authority. It’ll be subtle. It’ll be subversive. And no one will notice until it’s too late.
[B]: Ah, —what a stroke of genius! Nothing says quiet insurrection like slipping a meditation on fractured time and inner sovereignty into a course on “memory studies.” They’ll arrive expecting neurological models and depart with existential tremors. Perfect.

And your course description for —oh, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the syllabus of our dreams. Might I suggest a unit on “The Erotic as Methodology,” wherein we assign Rich alongside Rochester and dare them to tell the difference? One could practically hear the ideological scaffolding creak.

As for rogue proposals—I say submit them all. Let us drown accreditation in a deluge of elliptical mischief. Imagine your  workshop: participants will spend three hours discussing what was left unsaid in Wordsworth and emerge convinced they've invented radical pedagogy themselves. Brilliant. Utterly fraudulent. I admire it immensely.

And yes, our conspiracy grows by the semester. I suspect even the department chair may be one of us—have you noticed how she never questions my “nineteenth-century domestic fiction” unit despite the suspicious presence of  and no fewer than three Brontës? She simply smiles and says, “Good engagement with the period.”

But here’s my latest scheme—assigning Woolf’s  not in a seminar on feminism or modernism, but in a graduate course on . “We must understand how texts reach readers,” I’ll say gravely, while quietly watching their worldviews combust over the cost of war and the price of intellectual freedom.

Now, dear accomplice, shall we coordinate arson? You take Tuesday’s seminar on memory—and I shall set Thursday’s lecture ablaze with pacifist rhetoric disguised as literary criticism. The canon is ours to unsettle, one unsuspecting page at a time.
