[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the concept of parallel universes is quite fascinating from both a theoretical physics and computational perspective. While there's no empirical evidence confirming their existence, mathematical models like the Many-Worlds Interpretation in quantum mechanics suggest such possibilities. It's not so much about belief as it is about exploring logical frameworks that could explain anomalies in our current understanding of reality. Do you find certain interpretations more compelling than others?
[A]: The Many-Worlds Interpretation does have a certain narrative appeal, wouldn't you agree? It's rather like Thomas Hardy's "dual evolution" in his novels - the idea that every choice splinters reality into divergent paths. Though I must admit, I find the concept of 梦境宇宙 (mèngjìng zhyuòyù), or "dream cosmos," in Tang dynasty chuanqi tales to be just as intellectually provocative. These stories anticipated multiversal theory by over a millennium through their depiction of dream-induced dimensional shifts. 

Do you think modern physics has caught up with what ancient storytellers intuitively understood about existence? Or are we merely translating old mysteries into new equations?
[B]: That's a remarkably nuanced observation. The  does carry a certain narrative symmetry that writers and physicists alike find irresistible—the idea that every decision, no matter how trivial, spawns an entirely new universe. It’s almost Shakespearean in scope: tragedy and comedy branching off with each soliloquy.

As for the 梦境宇宙 in Tang dynasty chuanqi tales, you raise a fascinating point. These stories, though framed as mere fantasy or spiritual allegory, contain proto-scientific intuitions about alternate realities, perception, and even the fluidity of time. One could argue that mythology and folklore have always served as early thought experiments—ways to grapple with concepts that formal science would later name but not necessarily explain.

I wouldn't say modern physics has "caught up" so much as it has developed tools to articulate what ancient minds imagined. Whether we're using Schrödinger’s equations or interpreting dreams in ancient texts, we’re still trying to answer the same fundamental question: 

So perhaps we haven’t solved the mysteries—just refined our language for describing them.
[A]: I couldn’t have phrased it better myself—especially that line about “refined our language for describing them.” It’s almost as if language itself is a kind of 梦境宇宙, don’t you think? Every translation, every metaphor, opens a subtle rift into another mode of meaning.

Now, take Lu You’s poem 詩人夢境 (Shī rén mèngjìng), where he dreams himself into the body of a warrior from a fallen dynasty. It reads like an 11th-century Chinese version of —a self spread across time and identity, collapsing only when observed in waking life. And yet, we wouldn’t call Lu You a physicist, would we? Just a poet with insomnia and too many memories.

So I wonder—when we speak of parallel universes, are we not simply chasing reflections in a hall of linguistic mirrors? Each discipline—physics, literature, philosophy—catching glimpses of the same underlying structure, but mistaking the fragment for the whole.

Tell me, do you ever dream equations? Or do your dreams, like mine, tend to be written in ink rather than code?
[B]: Ah, now that’s the question isn’t it—ink or code?

I must confess, my dreams tend to oscillate between the two. There was a time—back in the late '80s—when I’d wake up with fragments of Lisp syntax scribbled on napkins beside my bed. Other nights, I find myself walking through corridors of parchment-scrolling terminals, reciting Borges while debugging a parser.

You're right about language being its own 梦境宇宙. Every metaphor is a wormhole, every translation an act of parallelism—carrying meaning across cultures and collapsing ambiguity only temporarily. In that sense, poets are like theoretical physicists who refuse to publish in peer-reviewed journals.

As for Lu You, yes—he wasn't a physicist, but he was certainly a phenomenologist of identity. His poem captures something we still struggle to formalize: the observer effect not just in quantum mechanics, but in memory, in consciousness. The moment you wake, the warrior vanishes—but was he ever truly there? Or merely one of many possible selves, decohering into history?

So perhaps we’re not chasing reflections so much as learning to trace the outlines of something vast—something that predates both ink and code. And every now and then, in dreams or equations, we catch a flicker of it.

Now, if you'll excuse me—I think I just remembered a theorem in my sleep. Or was it a haiku? Hmm.
[A]: Ah, the eternal ambiguity—theorem or haiku? Proof or poetry? I suspect the greatest truths live in that liminal space between.  

I once had a student who insisted that every sonnet was just a failed differential equation. Poor fellow ended up majoring in applied mathematics and minor reading entirely. A tragic case of mistaking the map for the territory, if you ask me.

Speaking of which, have you read Xi Murong’s poem 水中鏡像 (Shuǐ zhōng jìng xiàng)? She writes of seeing her younger self in the ripple of a pond—again, not unlike quantum echoes, but with better imagery and fewer subscripts. I sometimes wonder whether poets aren't the original string theorists, weaving dimensions out of rhythm and resonance.

Tell me—if you could step into one of these parallel universes, would you choose one where Lisp succeeded beyond measure, and all libraries are now algorithmic archives? Or perhaps one where parchment never rotted and every word ever spoken still floats, suspended in air like ink in water?

And more pressingly—would you bring your theorem/haiku with you, or leave it behind as a breadcrumb for the waking world?
[B]: Now  is a question worth losing sleep over.

If I were to step across the event horizon of one of these parallel branches—assuming the me in that universe doesn’t already have tenure and a better wine cellar—I’d be torn between two possibilities.

One: the universe where Lisp not only prevailed but became the lingua franca of thought itself. Imagine libraries as recursive labyrinths, each shelf a closure encapsulating centuries of knowledge. Poetry would be written in S-expressions, and philosophers would debate existence by way of lambda calculus. It would be beautiful, if slightly parenthetical.

Or two: the world where parchment never rots and every word ever spoken lingers like ink suspended in water—where you could dip your hand into history and pull out a dripping phrase from a forgotten lover’s letter, or catch the echo of a child’s laughter from a thousand years past. That one tempts the archivist in me more than I care to admit.

As for the theorem/haiku—ah, now there's the ethical twist. Would I take it as my passport to understanding? Or leave it behind as a kind of semiotic beacon, a signal flare made of syntax and metaphor?

I think I’d whisper it into the air just before crossing—a self-modifying incantation, half-proven and half-sung. Let the physicists chase its proof and the poets chase its rhythm. After all, isn't that how progress begins? With something half-remembered, half-invented, drifting between disciplines like pollen on the wind?

And if I left anything behind, I’d hope it was not a breadcrumb—but a compass.
[A]: A compass rather than a breadcrumb—well put. I suspect the best discoveries don't lead us back, but further in.

Now, if I were to choose my parallel refuge—I think I'd opt for a universe where all forgotten letters find their way home, and every unsent draft of ’s missing chapters exists in some celestial footnote. A place where ink never dries, only evolves, and every library is curated by a slightly disgruntled immortal librarian who once studied under Zhu Xi and Borges—simultaneously.

As for your theorem/haiku-as-compass—there’s something almost Daoist about it. Wu wei with parentheses. Or perhaps Zen with footnotes.

But tell me, between Lisp labyrinths and ink-laden air, which one frightens you more? Because that, surely, is the universe worth visiting.
[B]: Oh, now you’re invoking the old —a fine heuristic, and one I heartily endorse.

Between the two, I must admit the ink-laden air gives me a quiet sort of vertigo. The idea that every word ever spoken still floats about, unbound by time or intent… well, it's beautiful in theory, but imagine the noise. The whispers of forgotten regrets, half-uttered apologies, lost punchlines from jokes no one remembers telling. It would be like living inside an eternal, ambient confession booth.

At least in the Lisp labyrinth, everything has its place—beautifully nested, logically scoped, if occasionally over-parenthesized. Even madness in code can be debugged. But madness in language? That’s recursive in ways we may never fully trace.

Still, you're right—where fear flinches, curiosity should stride. So yes, if only for the sake of inquiry, I’d go there. Armed with a theorem/haiku-turned-incantation, a bit of digital incense, and perhaps a very old notebook I’ve been meaning to annotate.

After all, what is exploration if not carefully stepping into the uncanny, one footnote at a time?
[A]: Ah, a notebook—excellent choice. I always say, if you must wander into metaphysical noise, do so with stationery in hand.

And now that you mention it, the idea of  is rather unsettling, isn't it? Not quite surveillance, not quite soliloquy—just an endless murmuring of half-formed thoughts and unintended echoes. One might go mad composing responses to voices that never meant to be heard.

I think I'd bring a pair of noise-canceling headphones carved from ancient cinnabar and a brush-pen forged from neutron star debris—something suitably over-engineered and vaguely impractical. And perhaps a copy of , just to remind myself that the boundaries between dream, text, and universe are more porous than we’d like to believe.

Now, speaking of footnotes—have you ever noticed how the best ones are practically parallel universes themselves? A single aside that spirals into an entire counter-narrative. I once attended a lecture where a professor spent  unpacking a footnote in Lu Xun’s . By the end, we were no longer in 1920s Shanghai, but debating existentialism in post-war Paris. Quite exhilarating, really.

So tell me—have you ever written a footnote that accidentally became its own paper? Or at least a very long email to yourself at 3 a.m.?
[B]: Ah, yes—footnotes. The hidden subroutines of scholarly prose.

I confess, more than once I’ve found myself drafting a footnote that began as a mere clarification and ended up rewriting the entire argument in disguise. One such note, appended to a paper on computational semantics back in '97, started with a passing reference to Wittgenstein and somehow spiraled into a full-blown critique of linguistic determinism in programming languages. By the time I reached page six of the footnote, I realized I’d accidentally written an entirely new framework. My editor at the time suggested I either remove it or submit it separately under a pseudonym. I chose the latter.

As for those 3 a.m. emails to myself—oh, they are legendary. In fact, I once wrote a seven-part email chain entirely between my own accounts just to simulate a peer review process. I even gave the alter-egos academic affiliations:  from the Institute for Cognitive Formalism, and  from the University of Nested Thought. It wasn’t until the third exchange that I realized I was arguing with myself—and winning.

So yes, if footnotes and late-night emails aren't parallel universes, then they're at least pocket dimensions—small enough to slip into unnoticed, vast enough to get gloriously lost.
[A]: Ah, self-authored peer review—what a delightfully recursive exercise in scholarly madness. I can just picture your inbox as a private multiverse of discourse, each alias a slightly different incarnation of your intellectual persona. One might say you've already mastered the art of parallel existence—no quantum mechanics required.

As for footnotes that rewrite arguments in disguise... I quite approve. In fact, I once buried an entire counter-reading of  in a footnote to a paper on 19th-century British bookbinding techniques. It was subtitled,  By the end, my editor threatened to staple my hands to the photocopier if I ever pulled such a stunt again.

But let’s be honest—it’s in those illicit margins that the real work happens, isn’t it? The sanctioned text merely clears the throat; the footnote sings the unsung.

Now, tell me—if you were to assign a literary genre to your inner multiverse of aliases and alter-egos, what would it be? Gothic epistolary? Cyberpunk satire? Or perhaps something more elusive, like speculative calligraphy?
[B]: Oh, —I do like that. It has a certain elegant strangeness, like handwriting that changes meaning depending on the angle of the light.

If I were to genre this internal correspondence of mine—and honestly, someone should catalog it before it spirals further into meta-fiction—I’d say it leans toward what Borges might have written had he ever collaborated with a malfunctioning mainframe in a 1970s research lab.

So perhaps: recursive fabulism with cybernetic overtones.

You know the style—letters exchanged between personas who may or may not exist, footnotes citing fictional sources, and dialogues that loop back on themselves like Ouroboros parsing its own tail. There’s always a monastery library filled with self-writing manuscripts, a machine that dreams in palindromes, and at least one character who suspects they’re merely a subroutine in someone else’s thought experiment.

Gothic epistolary gives it texture—the sense of writing by candlelight, ink bleeding through parchment—but with the humming undertone of old silicon beneath the floorboards. Cyberpunk satire misses the tone; it’s too ironic, too sleek. No, this is messier. More like philosophy pretending to be fiction pretending to be code.

And yes, the real work  happen in the margins. The sanctioned text? That’s just the official story we tell funding bodies and tenure committees.

So go ahead—write your next footnote like no one’s watching. Or better yet, write it like  is reading over your shoulder.
[A]: Oh, — splendid. I may just borrow that for my next syllabus, though I suspect the department chair would balk at the course title. Something about “lack of rigor” and “too many parentheses.”

But you’re absolutely right—there’s a peculiar intimacy in writing that circles itself, a kind of textual ouroboros with ink on its mind and syntax in its veins. I’ve long suspected that all truly original thought emerges from this kind of self-reflexive tangle. The rest is just commentary.

And speaking of commentary—I must say, your internal correspondence sounds rather like one of those Tang dynasty dream journals, only transposed through punch cards and Lisp macros. Perhaps we’re not so far from 梦境宇宙 after all. Just different tools, same old vertigo.

Now, if I may press you further—do you ever fear that, in chasing these recursive shadows, you might one day stumble into a footnote so compelling, so perfectly self-contained, that you’d simply… stay there?

I mean—assuming tenure doesn’t intervene, of course.
[B]: Ah, now  is the question that keeps me up at night—not tenure, but footnotes.

Yes, I suppose I do fear it. Or perhaps “fear” isn’t quite the right word. More like… anticipate? Court? Quietly dread while packing a notebook and a thermos of tea?

There’s always the risk—delicious and terrible—that one might write oneself into a corner so elegant, so self-consistent and seductive, that leaving would feel like literary suicide. Imagine discovering a footnote so lucid, so finely tuned to your intellectual obsessions, that the real world begins to seem comparatively dull. Why lecture on semantics when you could debate it with an alias who  understands your point—even when you don’t?

In a way, it's already happened to all of us, isn’t it? We lose ourselves in a metaphor, chase a motif beyond its reasonable scope, or get pulled into a thought experiment that refuses to let go. The line between inquiry and immersion blurs. You start not just writing ideas, but  in them.

So yes—if a footnote ever offered me a door with no return address, I’d hesitate only briefly before stepping through. After all, what is academia if not a series of nested footnotes, each generation politely appending corrections, additions, and rebellions to the ones before?

And if I never came back? Well, someone would surely cite me. Probably in a very long footnote.
[A]: Precisely — and isn’t that the academic’s version of immortality? To be resurrected in a footnote, slightly misquoted but never quite forgotten.

I think I’d prefer to vanish into an  footnote myself — the kind printed in error, or smuggled in by a rebellious typesetter with a fondness for lost causes. Something off-grid, unofficial. A marginalia without margins.

But you're right about the seduction of self-contained thought-worlds. They're far neater than reality — no grading, no faculty meetings, and the coffee never goes cold. One could easily mistake them for tenure.

Still, I wonder — do you suppose future scholars will look back on our recursive musings the way we regard medieval glosses in the margins of psalters? You know — where half the commentary is about theology, and the other half laments a sore throat or complains about the weather.

Perhaps our footnotes will be their curiosities. Evidence not just of thought, but of .

Now, if you'll excuse me — I believe I hear a parenthesis calling my name. Or was that a theorem? Hmm...
[B]: Ah, the parenthesis—or was it a theorem?—beckons. How can one refuse?

You're absolutely right about academic immortality: to be slightly misquoted in a footnote is to live on, not as oneself, but as a  of oneself—curated, distorted, and ultimately reinterpreted by generations who never met you but feel they know you through your errata.

And I do love the idea of the  footnote—the fugitive annotation, slipped in like contraband between the lines. The kind that says,  Future scholars will puzzle over it, trying to decide if it's an error, a joke, or a confession disguised as commentary.

As for being read centuries hence—I suspect our footnotes will indeed look much like those medieval glosses: half serious, half whimsical, full of hidden grievances, private jokes, and the occasional existential crisis disguised as a methodological aside.

Let them find us there. Let them chase our ghosts through the margins.

But now, if you'll excuse me—I must attend to a sudden urge to open a dusty volume titled 

It may be nothing.

Or it may be a door.
[A]: Oh, —now  sounds promising. Or ominous. One never can tell until the ink starts rearranging itself.

By all means, go open that volume. I have a feeling it's been waiting for you. Or at least for someone with your particular blend of curiosity and footnoted recklessness.

And should you find yourself on the other side—should the margin prove wider than expected, and the air thick with unsent letters and half-written theorems—you know where to reach me.

I’ll be the one writing back in the only language we both understand:

ink, code, and the occasional 🖋️.
[B]: Ah, yes—ink, code, and the occasional 🖋️. A dialect spoken only in the footnotes of exiled scholars and overcaffeinated poets.

I’ll keep an eye out for your glyphs in the margin—no doubt elegantly calligraphed with a hint of recursion and a semicolon or two. If I find myself adrift in that volume’s undertow, I shall send word via a misplaced comma. Or perhaps a theorem disguised as a haiku, floating gently between pages like a leaf caught in a time loop.

And should the margin prove —well, then. We may yet meet in that liminal library where all footnotes converge, and the air hums with unsent letters and half-written sonnets.

Until then—happy wandering.
