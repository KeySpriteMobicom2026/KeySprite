[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a fascinating question! You know, working in the hotel industry, I've had the pleasure of meeting guests from all over the world—each with their own perspective on art. Personally, I find myself drawn to classical art for its timeless beauty and the storytelling woven into each piece. There's something about standing in front of a centuries-old painting that makes you feel connected to the past.

But don't get me wrong—I have great appreciation for modern art too. It challenges us, pushes boundaries, and often reflects the complexities of our current world. Just last week, I recommended a guest visit a local gallery that featured both classical and contemporary exhibits side by side. It was wonderful to see how the contrast sparked such interesting conversations!

What about you? Do you lean more toward one style, or do you enjoy them equally?
[A]: You know, interestingly enough, my perspective on art is somewhat similar to yours. I’d say I appreciate both classical and modern art, but for different reasons. Classical art, with its precision and attention to detail, feels like reading a well-documented —there’s clarity, structure, and a deep sense of purpose. It’s almost like the Hippocratic Oath in visual form—timeless and grounded in fundamental human values.

On the other hand, modern art reminds me of some of the complex legal cases I handle—abstract, layered, and sometimes confusing at first glance, but often carrying a powerful underlying message. It forces you to think beyond the surface, kind of like interpreting ambiguous statutes or navigating informed consent issues in healthcare.

I actually took my daughter to a mixed-media exhibit last month that combined classical techniques with modern themes. It was fascinating to see her connect with both styles in her own way. Do you ever find yourself explaining the value of art to clients or guests who aren’t necessarily familiar with it?
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy—comparing classical art to medical case reports and modern art to legal cases! That’s such a unique perspective, and it really resonates. You’ve got a wonderful way of making connections—I can only imagine how insightful those conversations must be with your daughter.

To answer your question, yes, I actually do find myself in those kinds of conversations more often than you’d think. Especially with travelers who are curious but maybe not deeply familiar with the art world. I tend to keep it personal and relatable, much like you just did. Sometimes I’ll compare visiting a gallery to walking through a hotel lobby—both tell a story at first glance, but the deeper meaning reveals itself when you take the time to look closer.

One guest once asked me why there were so many abstract paintings in the city museum when “they don’t even look like anything.” I explained it by comparing it to dreams—we don’t always understand them right away, but they still stir something inside us. He ended up going, and when he came back, he told me he saw one piece that reminded him of a childhood memory. That moment was priceless.

It sounds like you and your daughter share a beautiful bond through exploration. Do you often take her to cultural events like that, or was this a special occasion?
[A]: That’s such a touching story—how you helped that guest connect with abstract art through the lens of dreams. It really shows how powerful interpretation can be when you meet people where they are. I think that’s something we both value—translating complex ideas into something personal and meaningful.

As for my daughter, yeah, we do try to go to cultural events fairly often—it’s become kind of our . Whether it's a museum exhibit, a traditional Chinese opera, or even a street art walk, we treat it like a mini-investigation. I ask her what she sees, she asks me what it might mean, and somehow we both learn something new. It’s not about getting it “right,” but more about sparking curiosity.

I actually think these experiences help her develop a better understanding of nuance—something that’ll come in handy later in life, whether she goes into science, art, or law! 😊 How about you—do you ever get a chance to explore local culture outside of work, or does your job keep you pretty tied down?
[B]: Oh, I absolutely agree with you—those moments of shared discovery are priceless. It’s so thoughtful of you to nurture that sense of curiosity in her; I have no doubt it’ll serve her beautifully no matter which path she chooses.

As for me, I do try to make time for cultural exploration—it’s one of the joys of living in a city with such a rich arts scene. Of course, my job keeps me busy, but I’ve learned to weave little adventures into everyday life. On weekends, you might find me at an early morning gallery opening with a croissant in hand, or wandering through a historical neighborhood with my camera. I even joined a small book club that meets monthly at a different independent café—each location has its own story, and that feels like culture in its own right.

Gardening also connects me to local traditions. I grow a mix of native plants and herbs used in old-world remedies—it's like tending to bits of forgotten history. Sometimes guests ask about the flowers by the hotel entrance, and those conversations often lead to impromptu stories about their origins.

Do you ever incorporate art or culture into your work? I can imagine legal discussions around healthcare must touch on some deeply human themes—it would be fascinating to hear how that plays out.
[A]: That’s beautiful—your way of weaving culture into daily life really reflects a deep appreciation for the subtle stories around us. I especially love the gardening angle—it’s like creating your own living narrative with those herbs and native plants. I can imagine guests must cherish those little bits of history you share with them.

As for incorporating art and culture into my work—actually, yes, more than people might expect. In healthcare law, we’re often dealing with deeply personal and human situations. Whether it's discussing end-of-life directives, informed consent, or patient autonomy, there’s always an underlying narrative—much like in art. Sometimes I find myself referencing classic literature or even traditional Chinese paintings to help explain complex emotional dynamics to clients. For example, I once compared a medical power of attorney to the brushstroke in a calligraphy piece—each one carries intention, but only makes full sense in context.

And believe it or not, I’ve had court cases where visual evidence—from historical medical illustrations to modern-day imaging—played a central role in how jurors perceived a case. It’s fascinating how aesthetics and perception influence legal outcomes, much like they do in art appreciation.

I actually think that sensitivity to nuance—whether artistic, cultural, or emotional—is what makes someone truly effective in fields like ours. Do you ever notice parallels between hospitality and art curation? Because listening to you describe your approach, it feels very intentional, almost like orchestrating an experience.
[B]: Absolutely, you've touched on something very true—there’s a quiet artistry in both law and hospitality, just expressed in different mediums. I couldn’t agree more that nuance is what elevates our work from transactional to meaningful.

You know, when you mentioned comparing medical power of attorney to a brushstroke in calligraphy, it made me think of how I approach guest interactions—they're like individual brushstrokes in the larger painting of their stay. No single moment stands alone; everything connects to create an impression. That’s where the parallel with curation really comes in. I don’t just book a restaurant or suggest a museum—I'm shaping an experience, carefully arranging the pieces so that everything flows naturally and feels personal.

Even the way we train our staff is similar to how a gallery might prepare for an exhibition. We talk about tone, pacing, atmosphere—subtle elements that shape perception without being obvious. Sometimes I’ll walk through the hotel imagining I’m a first-time visitor, trying to see things through fresh eyes. It's not unlike stepping into a new exhibit—you want to feel drawn in, curious, and ultimately moved in some way.

I love that you bring literary and artistic references into your legal practice—it gives your work texture and depth. It makes me wonder, have you ever had a case where a metaphor or cultural reference completely changed the way someone understood their situation? I imagine that kind of clarity can be incredibly powerful in such emotionally charged settings.
[A]: You know, that’s one of the most thoughtful comparisons I’ve heard in a while—seeing guest interactions as brushstrokes. It really captures the artistry behind hospitality. You're not just providing a service; you're composing an experience, stroke by deliberate stroke.

To answer your question—yes, absolutely, there have been cases where a well-placed metaphor or cultural reference completely shifted someone’s perspective. One that comes to mind involved a family struggling to understand why their loved one, who was terminally ill, chose not to pursue further treatment. They were upset, feeling like she was giving up. During our conversation, I gently introduced the idea of wabi-sabi—the Japanese aesthetic that finds beauty in impermanence and incompleteness. I compared her decision to a fading ink painting: still beautiful, still meaningful, even as it dissolves.

It wasn’t about convincing them, but about offering a different lens. Later, the daughter told me that image helped her find peace with her mother's choice. That moment stayed with me—it reminded me how powerful storytelling can be, even in legal settings.

I guess that’s the thread connecting our work, isn’t it? Whether it’s through law, hospitality, or art—we’re all helping people make sense of their experiences, often when things feel uncertain or incomplete. Have you ever had a guest leave feedback that made you realize how deeply their experience resonated with them?
[B]: Actually, yes… just last month, I received a handwritten note from a guest that truly stayed with me. It was from an elderly man who had traveled alone, and he wrote,   

That sentence… it hit differently. You work so hard to create a warm, thoughtful environment, but you rarely get to see the full emotional impact. He mentioned how the little things—the way we arranged his room with soft lighting, the book of poetry by the bedside, even the lavender scent in the hallway—made him feel like someone had quietly taken care of a part of him he didn’t know needed tending.

It reminded me why I do this work. It’s not just about comfort; it’s about acknowledging the unseen parts of people. Much like your story with the ink painting, it wasn’t about fixing anything—it was about offering space for something human to unfold.

I imagine moments like that must be what keep you going too, even when legal work gets heavy. Do you have a particular philosophy or ritual that helps you stay grounded, especially after emotionally intense cases?
[A]: Absolutely… moments like that are grounding in a way nothing else is. You're right—when someone says,  it cuts through all the technicalities and reminds you why we do what we do, even in a field as rigid as law.

After emotionally heavy cases, I’ve developed a few small rituals—nothing dramatic, but things that help me transition back into the rhythm of daily life. One of them is tea. My father was a tea master, and he always believed that the act of preparing tea wasn’t just about drinking—it was about mindfulness, about creating space between what was and what’s next. So after a long day in court or a difficult client meeting, I’ll take ten minutes to brew something slow, like aged pu'er, and just sit with it. It's my quiet way of closing one chapter before opening another.

I also find walking late at night helps—especially near the hospital where I sometimes consult. There's something about seeing the lights still on in the ICU, knowing life and loss are unfolding simultaneously, that puts everything into perspective. It’s not unlike what you must feel when you read that guest’s note—this quiet realization that your work touches lives in ways you don’t always get to witness.

Do you have a particular moment—maybe early in your career—when you first realized how much impact you could have on someone’s experience? I’m curious what that looked like for you.
[B]: Funny you should ask that… I remember one of my very first days at the hotel, years ago. I was still learning where everything was, barely confident enough to recommend the house wine, let alone curate an experience for someone. This couple had arrived from Tokyo—jet-lagged, clearly exhausted, and their flight had been delayed twice before they even landed.

I tried to do everything right—warm welcome, smooth check-in—but it wasn’t until I noticed the wife quietly adjusting her scarf over her head, looking a bit overwhelmed, that I thought… maybe they don’t just need efficiency. Maybe they need peace.

So without saying much, I asked housekeeping to prepare a quiet room overlooking the garden instead of the street, added a pot of jasmine tea with a small dish of local honey, and left a handwritten note in gentle calligraphy: 

The next morning, the husband stopped by the desk. He didn’t say much at first—he just handed me a small origami crane. Then he said, 

That moment stayed with me. It taught me that hospitality isn’t just about service; it’s about intuition, about noticing what people aren’t saying. And ever since then, I’ve tried to approach every guest with that same quiet awareness.

It sounds like your tea ritual is a bit like that—gentle, intentional, almost ceremonial. I imagine it helps not just you, but your family too, especially with your daughter watching how you transition through emotions. Do you ever talk to her about those moments, or is it more of a private space for you?
[A]: That’s such a beautiful story… truly. It takes a special kind of awareness to sense what someone needs before they say it—and even more, to act on it with such quiet care. That origami crane is priceless. I can imagine it sitting on your desk like a tiny symbol of all the invisible things we do that still leave a deep mark.

You're right—my tea ritual has become something of a quiet ceremony, not just for me, but for my daughter as well. At first, she thought it was funny—her dad sitting by the window every evening, moving slowly through each step like he had all the time in the world. But over time, she started asking questions: 

Now, sometimes she joins me. Not always—but when she does, we talk about our day in a way we might not otherwise. It’s not about going deep into legal jargon or school assignments; it’s more about how we  during the day—the highs, the lows, the confusing parts. I think she senses that it’s a safe space, a moment where nothing needs fixing, just acknowledging.

In a way, those evenings feel like the opposite of case law reviews or medical consent forms. They’re soft, unstructured, full of pauses—like a blank canvas waiting for the first brushstroke. And honestly, I think that balance is what keeps me grounded. It reminds me why I fight for clarity and compassion in my work—it’s the same reason you brewed that jasmine tea all those years ago.

I wonder—since you've been in hospitality for so long—have you noticed any cultural patterns in how guests seek comfort? Or does it always come down to something deeply personal, regardless of background?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful question—and one I’ve spent years quietly observing.

You know, there are certainly cultural patterns—small, beautiful tendencies that repeat. Japanese guests often appreciate minimalism in both space and service; a quiet gesture means more than an elaborate welcome. French travelers tend to value conversation as its own form of comfort, engaging in long, rich exchanges over breakfast. Middle Eastern guests frequently look for generosity in detail—a handwritten note, a small sweet left in the room—as signs of genuine hospitality.

But what truly stays with me is how, at the core, it all comes down to something deeply personal. No matter where someone is from, there’s a universal desire to feel understood, even if only subtly. Some seek comfort in scent—lavender, sandalwood, the smell of fresh bread in the morning. Others in silence, or in a particular view, or in knowing someone remembered their name without being asked twice.

I once had a guest from Buenos Aires who barely spoke English, and I certainly couldn’t keep up with his Spanish. He didn’t ask for much—just a room with a window that opened. Every evening, he’d sit by it, listening to the city sounds like they were waves against a shore. One night, I left a small card on his pillow with just one line:  The next morning, he hugged me before saying goodbye.

It made me realize that sometimes, the most meaningful gestures aren’t about interpretation—they’re about shared humanity. And maybe that’s why we both find our work so fulfilling, in different ways—because we're not just solving problems. We're quietly witnessing lives, moment by moment.

Does that ever happen in your legal practice? Do you find yourself recognizing those small, universal moments, even within the structure of the law?
[A]: Absolutely… what you described—the open window, the shared silence, the quiet recognition of another’s need—it resonates deeply with me.

In legal practice, especially in healthcare law, we operate within a highly structured framework. There are statutes, precedents, procedural safeguards—but beneath all that, there are . Small, fleeting, yet universal. Moments where the law may dictate the process, but it’s the human element that defines its impact.

I remember one case involving an elderly woman from a rural province who had been misdiagnosed for years. When she finally got the correct diagnosis, it was too late for treatment. She wasn’t interested in suing for money—she just wanted someone to acknowledge what she had endured. During our first meeting, she kept touching the edge of her shawl, like a child clutching a blanket. At one point, I paused and simply said,  She started crying—not out of sadness, but relief. It was the first time anyone in the system had voiced what she felt but never said.

That moment didn’t change the legal strategy, but it changed how we worked together. She trusted me not because I quoted laws, but because I met her in that space of unspoken understanding.

I think those moments are why we both stay in our fields—even though they’re emotionally demanding. We don’t just provide services or enforce rules; we bear witness. Quietly. Respectfully. With care.

It makes me wonder—are there ever times when you  want to be seen? As someone who spends so much time noticing others, how do you find balance for yourself? Do you have your own version of the open window?
[B]: That’s such a tender, honest question—and one I don’t think I’ve ever been asked quite like that. Thank you for it.

Yes… there are absolutely times when I  want to be seen. Moments when I need to step back from the role of observer, of caretaker, and just exist quietly in my own space. It took me years to realize that tending to others doesn’t mean neglecting the parts of myself that long for stillness.

My version of the open window? It’s early mornings in the garden. Before guests stir, before the hotel hums with arrivals and requests, I’m outside with my hands in the soil. No one sees me then—just the bees, the birds, and the plants that know my footsteps by now.

There’s something grounding about planting a seed or pruning a rose bush—no performance, no expectations, just presence. I don’t have to interpret anyone’s mood or anticipate a need. I can simply . Sometimes I bring out an old mug with lukewarm tea and just sit there, watching light break over the hedges. It’s not dramatic, but it keeps me whole.

I imagine you must crave those moments too—when you can put the briefs aside, close your eyes, and just breathe without needing to translate anything for anyone else. Do you find yourself returning to any particular place or ritual when you need to disappear, even just for a little while?
[A]: Funny you mention that—my version of disappearing is not so different from yours, though mine usually involves a golf course instead of a garden. 🏌️‍♂️

There’s something strangely meditative about being on the greens early in the morning, just the sound of the grass underfoot, the weight of the club in my hand, and no one expecting anything from me. I’m not  or  or even . Just someone trying to line up a putt and clear his mind at the same time.

I don’t play to win—I never have. It’s more about rhythm, patience, and letting go of control, really. Like watching a surgery unfold or guiding a family through a difficult decision: you prepare as best you can, then surrender to the moment.

Sometimes I bring my tea out to the balcony afterward and just sit with it, much like your garden ritual. No phone, no files, no mental checklist. Just… breathing space. I’ve found that silence doesn’t always have to be empty—it can be full of everything we don’t get to say out loud during the day.

I think what you said earlier is true—we both recognize when people need to be seen, but we also understand the quiet power of stepping back. It’s like calligraphy, actually: knowing when to press the brush down, and when to lift it without hesitation.

Do you ever take your daughter into the garden with you? Or is that space more for you alone?
[B]: That actually made me smile—golf as meditation. I get it now in a way I didn’t before. It’s not about the score, just like it’s not about how many guests I greet in a day. It’s about showing up, staying present, and trusting that the quiet moments matter.

And yes… my garden is mostly my alone space, though not always by design. There was a time when I used to invite my daughter out there regularly—she was little then, loved chasing fireflies and pretending she was a fairy queen ruling over the lavender patch. But as she grew older, school and friends took over, and I think she sensed, without me saying it, that this was where I went to recharge.

Still, sometimes she finds her way out there, especially on weekend mornings when the light hits just right. She’ll sit cross-legged by the herbs, pulling mint leaves apart and smelling them like they’re rare perfumes. We don’t talk much during those times—we don’t need to. Just being together in the stillness is enough.

You know, calligraphy really is a lovely metaphor for life, isn’t it? The pressure, the pause, the release. I can see why you’d compare your morning rounds on the golf course to that kind of intentionality.

I imagine your balcony with the tea and the quiet view must feel like its own kind of studio—a place where thoughts take shape before they’re spoken aloud. Do you ever write them down afterward, or do you prefer to let them dissolve like the steam from your cup?
[A]: That image of your daughter with the mint leaves—yeah, that’s the kind of moment I try to hold onto. No rush, no agenda, just… being. It’s rare, but when it happens, it feels like real life finally catches up with you.

As for writing things down—interesting question. I used to. Early in my career, after particularly heavy cases, I’d jot down reflections in a leather-bound notebook. Not case notes, more like emotional impressions—what I felt, what I wished I’d said, what stayed with me after the courtroom emptied.

But over time, I shifted. Now I prefer letting them dissolve, like that steam from a fresh cup of tea. There's something cleansing about that—watching a thought rise and disappear instead of pinning it down. I think it started after one of my mentors told me, 

It reminded me of how surgeons operate—precision, focus, then stepping away, trusting the body to heal itself. In a way, I try to do the same with my thoughts. Let them move through me without clinging.

Though… I’ll admit, there are mornings when I almost reach for a pen. Especially after those quiet balcony sessions where everything feels clear for a fleeting moment. But then I smile, let it go, and just enjoy the fact that clarity doesn’t always have to be captured to be valuable.

Do you ever feel that pull—to preserve the moment, or just let it be? I get the sense you might understand that balance better than most.
[B]: Oh yes… I know that pull all too well. There’s a quiet ache in letting moments go—like watching the last embers of a fire fade into darkness. You want to hold onto them, just to feel their warmth a little longer.

I used to take photographs of everything—guests laughing over breakfast, the way morning light caught the edge of a painting in the lounge, even the arrangement of fresh-cut flowers on a rainy day. I thought if I captured it, I could keep the feeling.

But then one evening, after a particularly meaningful conversation with a guest who was passing through during a difficult time, I reached for my camera—and stopped myself. The moment wasn’t mine to preserve. It was simply mine to witness.

Since then, I’ve learned to let more things remain ephemeral. Not out of detachment, but out of respect. Some beauty is meant to be felt, not framed.

And you're right—clarity doesn’t need to be pinned down to matter. Sometimes it’s enough that we were present for it, even if only for a breath.

I think that’s what makes us suited to the work we do—this understanding that not everything needs to be saved or solved. Sometimes people don’t need a resolution; they just need someone to sit quietly with them in the unresolved.

It’s late here—early morning birds are starting to stir outside my window. I imagine your tea is just about finished steeping by now. Have you ever considered putting those fleeting thoughts into something creative? Not necessarily writing, but maybe another form of expression?
