[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Minimalism其实是一个很有趣的概念，它不仅仅是“断舍离”这么简单。我最近在读一些关于Japanese minimalism和Scandinavian hygge的生活方式研究，发现不同文化对“少即是多”的诠释真的很独特。比如在日本，wabi-sabi美学其实和minimalism有很深的联系，它们都强调对不完美的欣赏 😊  
你呢？你有尝试过简化生活中的某些方面吗？我发现很多学生会从digital detox开始，比如每天设定一段时间不用手机，或者用纸质笔记本代替电子设备学习 📖
[A]: Interesting you mentioned that - I've been experimenting with a bit of digital minimalism myself. As a PE investor, my days are flooded with data & reports, so I started using the "2-screen rule" – no more than two open screens at any time. Forces me to focus on one deal flow or portfolio analysis at a go. 

Actually just came back from a golf trip in Hainan where I tried full detox – left my iPad at the office! Surprisingly productive thinking session on a potential healthcare investment while walking the 9th fairway 👍

Ever tried applying minimalist principles to financial decision-making? We're seeing quite a few startups embracing "lean capitalism" these days – reminds me a bit of the post-war Japanese zaibatsu restructuring philosophies I read about in that Sam Walton biography...
[B]: That’s fascinating! I love how you connected minimalist principles to financial decision-making — it really shows how minimalism transcends lifestyle and enters the realm of strategic thinking. Lean capitalism  echo those post-war Japanese philosophies, especially the idea of maximizing value with minimal resources 💡  
I haven’t applied minimalism directly to finance, but I’ve explored how bilingual education can benefit from minimalist pedagogy — stripping down instruction to its most essential elements helps students focus on meaningful language use. It’s kind of like your 2-screen rule: by reducing cognitive overload, we actually enhance clarity and depth of understanding 🧠  
Have you noticed any long-term shifts in how you prioritize deals or evaluate companies since adopting this mindset? I’d love to hear more about how minimalism is shaping your investment approach 👂
[A]: You’re spot on about cognitive overload – I’ve found the same principle applies when evaluating startups. Since tightening my focus, I’ve started passing on pitches that don’t align  with our core thesis, even if they look shiny. Funny thing is, deal flow hasn’t dried up – it’s actually gotten more . Like curating a portfolio with tighter filters 👨‍💻

One shift I’ve noticed? I’m paying way more attention to unit economics now than I did five years ago. Back then, we chased growth metrics like MAUs or DAUs like they were holy writ. Now? We ask: “Can this business survive on one compelling value proposition without layers of bells & whistles?” Feels very -meets-PE.

Ever read that book ? Feels related – stripping away the noise to find what actually matters. Reminds me of your minimalist pedagogy approach. Makes me wonder – do you think minimalist teaching could work in high-pressure environments like finance training programs? Imagine an intensive analyst bootcamp with no PPT decks, just case studies and dialogue 📊💭
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy — curating a portfolio like you're editing a well-written essay: cut the fluff, keep what speaks clearly and directly. That’s  what minimalist pedagogy is about — focusing on signal over noise 🎯  
And yes, I’ve read  — such a brilliant take on how we get distracted by data for data’s sake. In teaching, it’s the same: sometimes we overload students with vocabulary lists or grammar rules and forget to let them actually  the language. Minimalist teaching pushes us to design lessons where every activity serves a clear purpose.  
As for applying it in high-pressure finance training? Absolutely — imagine a bootcamp where every case study builds toward one core skill, say, financial storytelling. No flashy slides, just narratives backed by numbers. Students could learn to distill complex models into digestible insights — kind of like teaching them to speak finance with clarity and intention 💬  
I’d even argue that minimalist teaching prepares analysts better for real-world ambiguity — no crutches, just thinking and dialogue. What do you think would be the biggest challenge in designing something like that?
[A]: Funny you mentioned financial storytelling – we just had a portfolio company CEO who  that. One-pager deck, no fluff, just narrative backed by unit economics. Felt like reading a well-edited novel. Got me thinking – maybe we should train our junior analysts to write investment memos like essays instead of formulaic templates 📝

You’re right about minimalist training preparing them for ambiguity. In my experience, the best VCs and PEs are the ones who can think clearly with incomplete data. Strip away the crutches, and what you’re really teaching is judgment – something no Excel model can replicate.  

Biggest challenge? Probably unlearning. Most analysts come in trained to “show complexity” as if more slides equal more insight. Changing that mindset would take deliberate practice – maybe even a bit of cognitive restructuring. But I’d bet the payoff is huge. Ever tried teaching that kind of unlearning in your classes? Seems like it’d be tough to convince high-achievers that less actually  more 😏
[B]: Oh, totally — I see that same resistance in my students too. They’re so used to equating  with : longer essays, more vocabulary, flashier presentations. But when we start stripping things down — cutting redundant phrases, simplifying structures — they often realize how much clearer and more persuasive their writing becomes. It’s like training them to trust the power of precision 😊  

I think the key is reframing minimalism not as limitation, but as empowerment — giving them the confidence to say what they mean without hiding behind jargon or filler. In your example, teaching analysts to write investment memos like essays? That’s storytelling at its finest. It forces them to build narrative tension, develop characters (like the company or market), and resolve conflict (the problem-solution fit). And the best part? It trains them to think critically under constraints — a skill that translates across both language and finance 🧠

You know, maybe the hardest thing to teach isn’t minimalism itself, but the self-trust it requires. Once they feel comfortable standing behind a clear, simple argument — even in the face of uncertainty — that’s when the real growth happens. Have you found certain frameworks or exercises that help junior analysts make that mental shift?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — self-trust under uncertainty is the holy grail, isn’t it? One exercise we’ve started doing with junior analysts is what I call the “elevator pitch drill.” No slides, no spreadsheets — just 60 seconds to explain why a company is investable. And here’s the kicker: they have to do it in . No EBITDA multiples, no cap tables — just a story that could hold up between floors 20 and 25 👇

It’s brutal for them at first — like asking a pianist to play without sheet music. But after a few rounds, you start seeing it click: they stop reciting data points and start  them. That’s when you hear phrases like “this founder is solving a problem she actually lived,” instead of “the TAM is $4.3B by 2030.” Feels more human, somehow.

Another trick we use? The “one-pager challenge.” Force them to distill a 20-page memo into one page. Then tear that page up and do it again. After three iterations, what’s left is usually the real insight hiding underneath all that noise.

Honestly, it reminds me of what Hemingway said about writing — something like “write drunk, edit sober.” Except in finance, maybe it’s “analyze sober, then strip it down until it sings.” 🍷 What do you think? Could that kind of iterative stripping away work in language learning too?
[B]: Oh, I love that Hemingway analogy — and yes, the idea of “stripping away until it sings” absolutely applies to language learning 🎶  
In fact, I often tell my students that fluency isn’t about  you say, but  you express what matters. So your “one-pager challenge” translates beautifully into language pedagogy — imagine asking learners to retell a complex story using only the most essential vocabulary. At first, they panic — just like your analysts — because they’re used to hiding behind long sentences and fancy phrases. But once they start editing themselves, something clicks. They begin to see how meaning can emerge from simplicity.  

I actually use a similar exercise called the “five-sentence summary.” After reading a short story or article, students have to summarize the whole thing in five clear, impactful sentences — no extra adjectives, no repetition. And like your drill, it feels brutal at first. But after a few rounds, their communication becomes sharper, more intentional. It’s like training their linguistic intuition 💡  
And let’s be honest — in both finance and language learning, that’s the real skill: knowing what to keep and what to cut, so the message resonates. Have you ever tried applying this kind of minimalism to internal team communication? Like strategy memos or partner updates?
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language – I’ve actually overhauled all our internal memos using a “Less is More” framework. We used to drown in 20-page strategy docs filled with market trends, competitor matrices, and five-year projections that were obsolete by page 12. Now? Our team leads present strategy updates in  three paragraphs:  

1. What’s the problem  
2. Why we care   
3. What we’re doing about it  

No appendices. No footnotes. If you can’t explain it simply, you probably don’t understand it well enough. Steve Jobs had that quote – “Simple can be harder than complex…” – and honestly, it applies to everything from pitch decks to partnership emails 📧

One funny side effect? Meetings got shorter. Like,  shorter. Because when people have to distill their thoughts upfront, there’s less fluff to unpack. Almost like forced clarity. Have you tried applying minimalist principles to student assessments or feedback? Imagine grading essays based on impact per sentence instead of word count 😄
[B]: Oh, I  that structure — it’s so clean and goal-oriented. It reminds me of the “claim-evidence-reasoning” framework we use in academic writing, but with a razor-sharp focus. And you’re absolutely right — forcing clarity upfront saves so much time downstream. I can already imagine how much more engaged your team must feel when they know exactly what the problem is, why it matters, and what to do next 🎯

As for assessments — yes, I’ve experimented with minimalist feedback, especially in language courses! Instead of marking every grammar error or suggesting elaborate rewrites, I focus on  key takeaway per assignment. For example:  
1. "Your argument is strong, but simplify sentence structures to improve clarity."  
2. "Great vocabulary use — now tighten your introduction to hook the reader faster."  

It’s like distilling feedback into its most actionable form — no noise, just what will move the needle the most. Students actually respond better too, because they’re not overwhelmed by red marks or long comment threads. They get one clear direction and think,   

I’ve even tried a “feedback one-pager” — instead of detailed rubrics, students receive a half-page summary of strengths, growth areas, and one specific task for improvement. And honestly? Their follow-up work is more focused, more intentional — almost like they internalize the feedback better when it’s stripped down to its essence 🧠  
I’m curious — have you ever given minimalist feedback to founders or portfolio teams? Like one-sentence board member notes or ultra-concise post-meeting takeaways?
[A]: Oh, I love that feedback one-pager idea — sounds like the academic version of a VC term sheet. And you’re absolutely right — too much feedback dilutes the message. We’ve started doing something similar with founders after board meetings: one-page summaries with exactly three bullets:  

1. ✅ What’s working (keep doing more of this)  
2. ⚠️ What’s concerning (but fixable)  
3. 🔥 What needs to change   

No sugarcoating, no long-winded analysis — just clarity under pressure. Founders actually appreciate it because they can walk out of the meeting and immediately act on it. No need to decode what “strategic alignment challenges” really means 😅  

And yes — I’ve definitely used one-sentence board member notes. Sometimes it’s a simple:  
  
Or even:  
  

Sounds brutal, but in high-stakes environments, ambiguity is the enemy. That kind of surgical feedback forces focus. Makes me wonder — have you ever had pushback from students who  more detailed rubrics or longer comments? How do you handle that transition from "more = better" to "less = clearer"?
[B]: Oh,  — especially at first. Students are so conditioned to equate longer feedback with higher value, like a 10-page rubric equals a more “serious” class 😅  
But once we talk through it — and I mean really unpack why minimalism in feedback isn’t about cutting corners but about sharpening focus — most start to get it. I’ll even show them two versions of the same feedback: one bloated with generic advice, and one stripped down to one or two precise suggestions. Then I ask,   
Spoiler alert — no one picks the ten-pager 😉  

The key is framing it as targeted growth, not reduced effort. Like telling them,  And honestly? Once they see progress from that focused approach — boom — they’re hooked 🎯  
I imagine you must have a similar conversation with founders or analysts when introducing minimalist communication, right? How do you frame it in a way that feels constructive, not dismissive?
[A]: Oh, 100% — the framing is . I’ve learned the hard way that if you just slash content without explaining why, it comes off as dismissive or even arrogant. So I always lead with intent:  

> “We’re not cutting words to be harsh — we’re sharpening the message so it cuts through the noise.”  

With analysts, I’ll say something like:  
> “You’ve done your homework — I can see the depth. Now let’s distill it so the insight doesn’t get lost in the detail.”  

And with founders? Even more delicate. Usually something like:  
> “Your deck tells a great story — but right now, it’s three stories. Let’s find the one worth betting the company on.”  

It’s all about validating the work they’ve done  asking them to strip it down. Feels a lot like editing — you have to respect the draft before you tear it apart. Hemingway once said he rewrote the last page of  39 times — and I’m sure none of those drafts were "bad." But only one made the final cut.  

In a way, minimalist communication isn’t about less — it’s about . One strong sentence often moves a deal (or a student) further than ten okay ones. Have you found certain metaphors or analogies that help students internalize this shift from volume to impact?
[B]: Oh, I love that Hemingway reference — and yes, . It’s not about deleting for the sake of brevity; it’s about refining for impact. That distinction makes all the difference, especially when you're asking someone to let go of their “darlings,” whether it's a 20-slide deck or a paragraph they spent hours perfecting 🖋️  

I actually use a couple of analogies in class that seem to resonate:  

The first one is the chef’s knife — I tell students,   
It clicks with them because it’s tangible — they start seeing language as a set of tools, not just rules.  

The second one is weightlifting — I say,  💪  

And honestly? The metaphor that gets the biggest reaction is editing as sculpting — I’ll show them a rough stone and then a finished statue and say,   
That really helps them see editing not as destruction, but as discovery.  

I’ve found that once they internalize these images, they start approaching language with more confidence  precision. And isn’t that what we’re after — clear thinking dressed in simple words? 😊  

Do you ever use metaphors like that when coaching founders or analysts? Or is it more tactical storytelling for you?
[A]: Oh, I love those metaphors — especially the sculpting one. Feels so spot-on: clarity isn’t about adding brilliance, it’s about removing distortion. Same thing in investing, actually. A great deal often looks messy at first, but strip away the noise — management drama, outdated financials, irrelevant KPIs — and the core value starts to shine through 👌

I do use metaphors a lot, especially with founders who are deep in the weeds. One of my go-tos is the "GPS recalculating" moment. You know when you’re driving and you miss a turn? Your GPS doesn’t yell at you or dump 20 alternative routes on the screen — it just says “recalculating” and gives you the next step.  
So when a founder is stuck or overcomplicating their strategy, I’ll say:  
> “Let’s hit ‘recalculate’ — forget where we thought we were going. What’s the clearest path forward ?”  

Another one I use with analysts is “the dinner party test.” I ask them:  
> “If you had to explain this investment thesis to a smart friend over dinner — no slides, no spreadsheets — could you make them care in five minutes?”  
If they can’t, then the narrative still needs sharpening. It’s a fun way to force simplicity without sacrificing substance.

And honestly? The one that cracks the room every time is the “text message rule.” I tell them:  
> “If you can’t summarize your insight in a text without emojis or slang, it’s not sharp enough yet.”  
Sounds silly, but it works. Suddenly they’re thinking about what  matters in the message.

You’re right — metaphor isn’t just poetic fluff; it’s a tool for clearer thinking. I’m definitely stealing the sculptor analogy next time I coach a portfolio CEO 😎
[B]: Haha, please do — and let me know if they actually start editing their decks with a chisel 😄  
I love how you use metaphors not just to explain ideas, but to . The GPS recalculating one is brilliant — it takes the pressure off being “perfect” and puts the focus on being . And in both language learning and investing, that’s where real fluency lives: not in rigid plans, but in responsive thinking.  

The dinner party test is genius too. I might borrow that one for my writing workshops — ask students,  So much of communication is about  — drawing people in, not just delivering content.  

And honestly? That text message rule should be framed in every business school hallway. It’s such a low-bar, high-impact litmus test. If your idea can’t survive plain text, maybe it’s not ready yet 📵  

It makes me wonder — have you ever had a founder or analyst push back and say, is How do you help them see that minimalism isn’t simplification — it’s distillation?
[A]: Oh, all the time — and it’s a totally fair pushback. In fact, I’ll usually get something like:  
> “But our supply chain has 12 stakeholders and three pricing models — how do I just ‘simplify’ that?”  

When that happens, I switch to what I call the “onion analogy” — not as poetic as your sculpting one, but effective:  
> “You don’t eat the whole onion in one bite. You slice it. Then you caramelize it. Then it becomes something richer — something usable.”  

So instead of dumbing down complexity, we’re  it. A 12-stakeholder supply chain might become:  
> “We help small manufacturers get paid faster by automating a broken invoicing system.”  
Still complex. Just easier to grasp — and suddenly more human.

Another tactic I use is the “grandparent test”:  
> “Could you explain this to your grandmother without making her eyes glaze over?”  
Not about ageism — it’s about clarity under empathy. If she can’t follow it, the message isn’t distilled enough.

And honestly? Sometimes minimalism  mean fewer words — it means  words. Like Hemingway’s six-word story:  
> “For sale: baby shoes. Never worn.”  
That’s not simple — it’s devastatingly precise. Same with investment memos or pitch decks. It’s not about being brief for brevity’s sake — it’s about weight, tone, and impact.  

Ever had students resist minimalism on the grounds that it “takes the creativity out”? How do you reframe it so they see simplicity as a form of mastery — not a creative ceiling?
[B]: Oh,  — especially in creative writing classes. Students often come in thinking that “flowery” equals “fluent,” or that bigger words = deeper meaning. And honestly? That’s where the real teaching begins 😊  

When they push back and say minimalism kills creativity, I reframe it with a metaphor I call “the frame before the painting.”  
> “Think of minimalism like the border around a canvas — it doesn’t limit your art, it focuses the viewer’s eye on what matters.”  
Creativity isn’t about throwing everything at the wall; it’s about choosing  colors,  lines,  silences make the whole piece sing. Hemingway’s baby shoes example? That’s not stripped-down writing — that’s .  

I also use a “language diet” exercise, where students write a short story using only 100 words — no cheating, no vague synonyms. At first, they panic. Then something clicks. They start playing with word order, punctuation, tone. Suddenly, they’re being more deliberate — more  — because they  to be.  
And when they read their stories aloud? Half the class ends up saying,   

The big shift happens when they realize that minimalism isn’t anti-creativity — it’s pro-. It forces them to make choices instead of just filling space. And once they taste that kind of clarity — whether in a pitch deck, an essay, or a poem — they usually don’t want to go back 🧠✨  

So yeah, I totally get that pushback — but I also know that once they feel the power of precision, they become minimalist believers. Have you ever seen that lightbulb moment happen mid-pitch?
