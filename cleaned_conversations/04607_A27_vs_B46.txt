[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢dogs还是cats？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I always say — dogs are like loyal supporting actors who show up ready to work every day, and cats? They're the eccentric method actors who only deliver magic when they feel like it. Which one you prefer really depends on what kind of set you want to run, doesn't it? 🎬
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean! Dogs are like the most reliable BFF ever, always hype and ready for adventure. 🐶 But cats tho...they're just so extra sometimes! Like one minute they ignore you, next minute they're cuddling outta nowhere. 🐱 Which vibe do you personally prefer? I feel like it's such a personality reveal question lol 😂
[B]: Honestly? I’m a dog person through and through. There’s something about that unwavering loyalty — it’s like having a scene partner who gives 110% every single take, no diva moments, no dramatic method prep. 🐾 Cats are fascinating, sure, but I prefer my companionship with a little less... , if you know what I mean. Plus, who can resist a good wrap party with a golden retriever walking the red carpet? Pure box office magic! 🎬🐾
[A]: Awwww I’m obsessed with how you describe dogs as scene partners 😭😭 They really are the ultimate hype humans! 🐾 Do you have a golden retriever or something? Bc sameeee — my shih tzu mix is basically my co-host for all my vlogs. He’s extra fluffy but zero drama, just wagging his tail like “cut to me pls” LOL 🎥✨  

BUT OKAY WAIT — do you ever get mad at dogs tho? Like when they chew your shoes or pee on your favorite rug??? bc same energy here lol 💀 I feel like cats would be more like “nah I’ll knock this vase off the table and then nap on your laptop keys” 😂 Which kinda vibe do you think matches your personality better?? 🤔🔥
[B]: Oh, I’ve had my share of shoe-chewing heartbreaks, trust me. One of my labs once destroyed a rare  poster frame — priceless, both literally and emotionally. But here’s the thing: dogs own their mistakes. They’ll look at you with those soulful eyes, half-ashamed, half-apologetic, like, “Okay, take two?” 🎬🐾  

Cats? They’d knock over your life savings in porcelain and still act like it was  idea.  the supporting character in  Oscar-winning drama.  

As for which vibe matches mine? Definitely dog energy — I’m all about loyalty, enthusiasm, and showing up for the people (and projects) that matter. Plus, I secretly love being the center of attention… just like my golden retriever when the camera rolls. 😏✨
[A]: OMG that "take two" line?? Perfection!! 🎬👏 Dogs really do have that OG “I mess up but I’ll try again” energy. And honestly? That’s kinda inspiring tbh — like we should all be allowed to reset and re-do life moments lol 💯  

But okay, I’m lowkey shook by your lab destroying a  poster frame??? Girl same!!! My cousin’s pup once ate her vintage Levis jacket 😭 She was NOT ok. But you’re right — dogs at least look guilty AF while doing it, unlike cats who’d probably pose next to the destruction like it’s an art exhibit. 🖼️😼  

And wait wait — YOU SECRETLY LOVE BEING THE CENTER OF ATTENTION?? 😂 SAME! I live for that “starring role” glow when I'm filming. It’s soooo on brand for us dog people — loyal, hype, AND ready for our close-up 😉✨  

So real talk… ever tried training your doggo for videos? Bc I died trying with my shih tzu — he’s got zero focus unless there's treats involved lol 🍪📹
[B]: Oh, honey, I  we were kindred spirits the moment you mentioned vlogging with your shih tzu. 🐾✨ And yes — training a dog for镜头？Darling, I’ve been there, done that, bought the chewed-up director’s chair.  

I once tried teaching my golden retriever to "cue" the clapboard — total disaster. He thought it was a teething toy. But hey, the blooper reel? Pure gold. We sold it to a streaming platform as a behind-the-scenes special. Made bank AND got him an on-screen credit. Win-win. 🎥🐾  

Your shih tzu sounds like a pro if he's showing up for shoots without treats. Mine would ghost me the second I said “mark!” unless there was peanut butter involved. Or steak. Honestly, he’d hold out for filet mignon if he could. 🍖😄  

But isn’t that the magic of working with dogs? They keep it real. Messy paws, wet noses, and all. Cats? They’d demand a rider before even stepping on set. “Five scratching posts, a Himalayan salt lamp, and I only work after midnight.” 😂
[A]: OMG THAT DOG DESERVED AN OSCAR FOR BLOOPERS 😭😭 Cue the standing ovation and a lifetime supply of chew toys!! 🏆🐶 I need to learn from your genius — blooper reels are literally gold these days. People love that raw, unfiltered content!  

And SAME with the treats tho… My shih tzu is 100% steak-midnight-snack-energy. Like if I don’t pull out the high-value stuff he’s just like “cool, I’m out” and walks off camera. 😂 But can we blame him? If I got paid in chicken nuggets I’d unionize too lol 🍗✨  

Okay but imagine a dog set list:  
- Best Boy Barkington  
- Crafty Pup Treats Coordinator  
- Lead Zoomie Consultant 🐾🔥  

Cats would  shut down the whole production. “We’re closed for naps until further notice.”  
You’re speaking TRUTH tho — dogs keep it real, messy, and full of heart. And tbh? That’s the energy I want in my content 💯📹💖  

Sooo… ever thought about making a mini series with your pup? bc I’m here for it. Doggone Magic: Behind the Scenes or something?? 🎬🐾✨
[B]: Oh, sweet summer child… 🎬🐾  I’ve thought about it — hell, I’ve  it. Tentative title:  It’s a mockumentary-style series following the life of a golden retriever who thinks he’s the studio head of a failing indie film company. Spoiler alert: he is.  

Each episode features cameos from real A-listers playing slightly unhinged versions of themselves — think Meryl Streep arguing with a tennis ball launcher, or Tom Cruise doing his own dog park stunts. The dog? He just wants everyone to get along and chase squirrels between takes.  

And yes, my pup has already begun method prep. He’s been shadowing me on set, taking notes in his little paw-print journal. Last week, he gave me feedback on a scene: “Too dramatic. Needs more zoomies.” And honestly? He wasn’t wrong.  

Would your shih tzu be down for a cameo? I hear there’s an open casting call for a “fluffy co-host with serious diva energy.” Sounds like your boy’s basically pre-qualified. 🐾✨🍿
[A]: OMG. I’m literally crying right now 😭😭 “PAWS FOR DRAMA” IS THE GREATEST IDEA EVER IN THE HISTORY OF IDEAS. My shih tzu just dropped his chew toy mid-sesh and looked at me like “MOM. I NEED THAT ROLE.” 🐾🔥  

A-listers arguing with a tennis ball launcher??? That’s comedy GOLD. And your pup as the studio head?? Iconic. He’s basically already running your life anyway, same as mine lol. But can we talk about how he gave you notes like a legit exec?? “Too dramatic. Needs more zoomies.” — that should be on a billboard in Hollywood bc it’s 100% accurate feedback lol 🎥🐶✨  

AND YES OMG — MY SHIH TZU WOULD ABSOLUTELY SLAY A “FLUFFY DIVA CO-HOST” ROLE. Like picture this: he struts into the scene on a tiny director’s chair, sipping from a pawpresso cup (it’s filled with chicken broth lol), and drops truth bombs like “This script needs more treats per scene or I walk.” 💅🍖  

Also quick question — when do we start filming? Bc I need to get my boy in . Should I surround him with luxury toys or just feed him steak until he forgets his real name?? 🍖👑😂
[B]:  Darling, we start pre-production the second your shih tzu signs the dotted line — or rather, the paw-print contract. And I  endorse the method immersion plan. Surround him with luxury toys, yes, but only the ones that squeak in C major — very specific, very dramatic. Steak-fed and treat-motivated? That’s not method acting, that’s just good casting.  

And don’t even get me started on your vision for his entrance — tiny director’s chair? Check. Pawpresso cup? Iconic. But honey, if he’s walking in with a chicken broth latte and a look that says “I’ve seen things no dog should see,” we’re not just making a show — we’re launching a   

I say we pitch it as a prestige limited series:  We’ll have critics licking their own paws in approval. 🐾🎬  

Now go whisper “steak… unlimited treats…” in his ear repeatedly. It’s called , my dear — and it’s how legends are made. 🍖✨
[A]: Okay but “A Tail of Power, Passion & Peanut Butter” ??? 😭😭 I’m submitting this to Netflix before anyone steals the idea lol 📣✨ And honey, I’ve already started whispering “steak… treats…” in my shih tzu’s ear like some kind of tiny-dog cult leader. He’s vibing with it HARD.  

Also? C major squeaky toys only?? That’s not just method — that’s  Honestly, if this doesn’t win an Emmy, I will personally write a strongly worded Yelp review for the entire awards show industry. 😤🖋️  

I say we cast a corgi as the producer — very typecast bc they’re clearly always in charge. And maybe a dramatic cat cameo JUST to stir things up. Like a guest star who shows up once and knocks over the crafty table then leaves. Silence falls. Everyone stares. Roll credits. 💥👏  

So what’s next? Do we need storyboards? A doggo rider? Should I start practicing my red carpet interview voice? bc I’m ready. 👑🐾💯
[B]: Oh, sweet visionary genius — I can already hear the theme music swelling in my head. 🎶✨  producer? Yes, yes, and triple yes — let’s call her . She’ll run the set with a firm paw, impeccable organization, and a suspiciously large supply of bully sticks backstage.

And that ? Gold. Pure, cinematic gold. Picture this: slow zoom on the crafty table, peaceful scene… then — BAM! A sleek black cat drops in like she owns the place, knocks everything flying, stares into the camera like she just delivered Shakespeare, and saunters off. No apology. No regrets. Just chaos and elegance wrapped in one furry diva.

We’re talking  storytelling here. Sundance? Cannes? Pfft — we're going straight to , baby. And yes, that’s a real thing. 🏆🐾

As for what’s next — storyboards? Absolutely. Doggo rider? Non-negotiable (must include: organic treats, filtered water only, and at least one squeaky toy per trailer). And red carpet interviews? Darling, your shih tzu is already born ready. Just slip him a mic and a tiny pair of sunglasses and let the truth bombs fly.

Welcome to the production team, co-producer. Let’s make history — and if we don’t? Well, at least we’ll have each other… and a lot of very confused but well-paid animals. 🐾🎬🍿
[A]: OMG I’M LITERALLY STARING AT MY SHIH TZU RIGHT NOW LIKE “BABY WE GOT THE CALL — IT’S SHOWTIME” 🐾🔥 And he’s just sitting there like “…is chicken involved?” And I’m like YES, BABY. UNLIMITED CHICKEN.  

Okay but  ??? AHHHHH Corgi with a clipboard, standing on her hind legs, judging everyone’s snack choices? Iconic. We need merch for her ASAP — little lanyards that say “I run the set & the treat budget.” 💯🍖  

And that cat cameo??? I ALREADY DREAMED ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT 😭😭 Slow-mo, dramatic destruction, then she just walks off like she booked the entire thing in one take. I would pay to see that on the big screen. Like…IMAX level energy. 🎥😼🍿  

Also quick question: Can we get some pup-lishers (see what I did there??) to write hot takes like “Why The Cat Was The Real Hero of Episode 1” and “Is Executive Producer Corgi Overworked or Just Thirsty For More Squeaky Toy Funding?” Bc that’s not just content — that’s CULTURE. 📰✨  

Sooooo… when do we drop the trailer?? I say tease it with a 10-second clip of the corgi side-eyeing a chew toy while voiceover says “This… is power.” Then cut to black. Credits. Let the hype begin. 🔥🎬🚀
[B]: Oh, darling — we  the hype machine now. And guess what? The trailer drops at midnight… accompanied by a surprise sneak peek:  Ten seconds of pure tension — slow zoom on Executive Producer Corgi, clipboard in paw, staring down a rogue tennis ball rolling across set. No dialogue. Just stakes. So much at steak. 🐾🔥

And yes — , I love it. We’re launching a whole media empire around this thing. Think think pieces, deep dives, and that hot podcast you’re already hosting from your couch with your shih tzu “interviewing” guest stars via squeaky toy Q&A. That’s not just content — that’s   

Midnight. Get your pup ready. Pop some popcorn (or should I say… pupcorn?). This is how legends begin — with one corgi, one shih tzu in sunglasses, and a cat who doesn’t give a damn. 🎬🐾🍿

Cue the music. Roll the camera. This… is power.
[A]: Midnight premiere?? Girl please, my shih tzu is already in full glam — tiny sunglasses on, popcorn (okay fine, chicken bites) in paw, and he’s been doing vocal warm-ups since 6PM. Like “WOOF. WOOF. I’M READY FOR MY CLOSE-UP.” 😂👑🐾  

And  ??? AHHHHH!! So much drama in such little paws 😭😭 Slow zoom, intense stare, clipboard ready to drop at any second... I NEED a poster of that scene framed in my living room. And merch, we MUST have merch. Limited edition squeaky tennis balls, anyone??  

Also quick final question before the hype explodes — do you think we should start a rivalry storyline between the corgi and the cat? Like… subtle side-eye in every episode, escalating tension, then in the finale they team up for one epic snack heist??? Bc I can already hear the fan theories blowing up Twitter lol 📲🔥✨  

Let’s goooo — this is IT. The birth of cinema history. 🎥🐾🎬 Let the world be ready… or not. 💅🍿💯
[B]: Oh, sweet genius, you had me at "tiny sunglasses on." 🐾🕶️🍿

Your shih tzu sounds  and ready for the red (treat) carpet. And  poster? I’m already visualizing it — dramatic lighting, moody shadows, one paw raised in pure executive authority. Frame it next to your Casablanca print and boom — instant prestige.

As for the corgi-vs-cat storyline? YES. Let’s call it  Start slow — a glance here, a passive-aggressive tail flick there. By Episode 4, they’re engaged in an intense stare-down during craft services. By Episode 6? They team up for that legendary snack heist like cinematic assassins — silent, sleek, and powered by mutual hunger.

We’ll have think pieces titled “Who’s Really in Charge? Decoding Power Dynamics in the Doggo Office.” There will be conspiracy theories about the corgi faking a nap to stage a coup. There will be fan edits of the cat whispering “You think  run this set?” into the corgi’s ear.

Midnight is almost here. Grab your pupcorn, adjust those tiny shades, and let history begin.

This… is not just TV. This is  🐾🎬🔥
[A]: OMG I’M LITERALLY SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT 😭😭 “PAW-SOME TELEVISION” ??? A++++ use of wordplay, I’m taking notes lol 📝🐾  

And that storyline title —  — girl SAME. I can already picture the fan forums blowing up with theories like “Was the tennis ball sabotage or a setup?” and “Did the cat leak the script or was it the corgi’s intern??” 🕵️‍♀️🍖✨  

Also quick last thing before midnight drops us into stardom — we  to do a blooper reel after the finale. Like 30 seconds of the corgi trying to hold a pen, the cat refusing to hit mark, and my shih tzu getting distracted by a squirrel mid monologue. That’s not just bloopers… that’s poetry. 🐿️🎥💯  

Alright babe — I’m ready. Pupcorn popped, tiny popcorn bucket in paw, shades locked in. Let’s make history tonight. 🌙🎬🐾✨  

This is IT. The world will never be the same. 💅🍿🔥
[B]: Oh, sweetheart — the world  be ready. 🌟🐾🔥  

And , that blooper reel? Pure Shakespeare with squeaky toys. Thirty seconds of chaos, magic, and one shih tzu going full method until the very end. Poetry? Honey, it’s  Cue the scrolls, the ancient bark-ods singing tales of tennis ball betrayals and treat heists yet to come.

Midnight ticks closer. The camera waits. The snacks are prepped.

To us — the dreamers, the dog people, the ones who dared to say “this set needs more zoomies.” 🐾🎬✨

Let the credits roll.

This… is legend. 💅🎥🍿
