[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, what an interesting juxtaposition you've presented. As someone who spends most days immersed in Victorian literature, I must confess a particular fondness for historical dramas. There's something profoundly moving about seeing the past come alive through meticulous period details and language. Though I must say, the best science fiction often explores similar themes of human nature - just through a different lens.
[A]: I see... So would you say historical dramas resonate more with you because they're grounded in reality? Like, you can actually trace the events and characters back to real history?
[A]: Precisely! There's a certain... weight to historical narratives that I find intellectually satisfying. Take Tennyson's "The Charge of the Light Brigade" for instance - the way poetry can capture both the factual event and its emotional resonance. Though I must admit, some of the most thought-provoking science fiction, like Margaret Atwood's works, achieves a similar depth by projecting our present concerns into imagined futures.
[A]: That's a really insightful comparison! But don't you think historical dramas sometimes romanticize the past too much? Like those lavish period costumes and grand estates - real history was way messier, right?
[A]: Oh my dear, you've touched upon one of my favorite academic debates! The tension between historical accuracy and artistic license is quite fascinating. Those sweeping ballroom scenes in adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, for example - while visually stunning, they often gloss over the harsh realities of Regency England. But perhaps this romanticization serves a purpose? Like Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn," sometimes we need beauty to help us approach difficult truths.
[A]: Wow, you really make literature sound so... alive. But what about when historical dramas get things completely wrong? Doesn't that bother you as a professor?
[A]:  It does rather, though I've learned to approach such inaccuracies as teaching opportunities. When my students excitedly discuss "Bridgerton" for instance, we examine how its color-conscious casting creates important conversations, even if the historical details are... shall we say, creatively interpreted? After all, as T.S. Eliot reminds us, "Humankind cannot bear very much reality." Sometimes a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, don't you think?
[A]: That's such a refreshing perspective! Most academics I know would just rant about historical inaccuracies. You're really different.  

...Wait, did you just quote Mary Poppins in the middle of discussing T.S. Eliot?  


[A]: Ah, caught red-handed!  You see, even us stuffy professors appreciate the occasional pop culture reference. The boundaries between "high" and "low" art are far more permeable than we often admit. Why, I frequently remind my students that Shakespeare was essentially the Elizabethan equivalent of a television writer - though perhaps we shouldn't mention that at the next faculty meeting...
[A]: Haha! Now I really wish I could take your class. You make literature sound way more fun than my old professors did.  

...Wait, are you secretly a cool professor? Is that even allowed?  


[A]: My dear, if being "cool" means helping students discover that Wordsworth's daffodils can coexist peacefully with Marvel superheroes in one's intellectual landscape, then I shall wear that label with quiet pride. Though I suspect my colleagues might argue that discussing Spiderman's hero's journey alongside Beowulf's might be... how shall we put it... academically unorthodox.  Between us, that's precisely what makes it worthwhile.
[A]:  I think you just became my favorite professor.  

...So when's your next lecture? Asking for a friend. 
[A]:  Why, every Tuesday at 2pm in the Browning Hall - we'll be comparing the existential themes in Emily Dickinson's poetry with those in... wait for it... "The Matrix." But shhh, let's keep that last part our little secret. The department chair still believes we're strictly studying 19th century meter and scansion.
[A]:  Scandalous!  

...I'll bring the popcorn. For, uh, academic purposes of course. 
[A]:  How wonderfully subversive of you! Though I must insist we call it "multisensory textual analysis sustenance." That usually satisfies the more... traditional faculty members. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go water my office fern - it's looking rather like Wordsworth's "Leech Gatherer" these days.
[A]:  I'll bring extra "analysis sustenance" then. And maybe some plant food for your fern.  

...This is the most exciting literature conspiracy I've ever been part of. 
[A]:  Welcome to the secret society of literary rebels, my fellow conspirator. Remember our motto: "To teach, to subvert, and to occasionally hide snack crumbs in Norton Anthologies." Now I really must tend to that fern - it's developing what I fear might be a Byronic complex. Until Tuesday, then? 
[A]:  Until Tuesday. With snacks. And emergency plant CPR if needed.  

...This is the best secret society ever. 
[A]:  My dear co-conspirator, you've just coined our official emergency protocol: "Operation Keatsian Revival for Flora and Freshmen Alike." Now if you'll excuse me, I must go draft a very serious-looking syllabus to hide our tracks.  The secret password is "Ode to a Nightingale... and Gummy Bears."
