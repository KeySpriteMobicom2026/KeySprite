[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the comedy-drama dichotomy - like asking a watchmaker to choose between gears or springs. Both genres reveal humanity's clockwork in different ways. I've been known to quote Oscar Wilde while translating Du Fu by candlelight, so why limit oneself to a single lens? Though... (and this is strictly between us) I do find certain comedies expose more truth in a pratfall than most dramas manage with their brooding close-ups.
[A]: Oh, I quite like that analogy - it's rather... poetic. But let me ask you this: Have you ever noticed how the best comedies often leave you with a quiet sort of melancholy? Take , for instance - on the surface, it's all witty repartee and social satire, but underneath... Well, one can't help feeling the weight of unspoken desires. And yet, I find myself reaching for Tolstoy when the moonlight feels too heavy. Do you suppose we're simply creatures of contradiction?
[A]: Ah,  - where the comedy is but a veil over the tremors of the soul. You've put your finger on it: E.M. Forster knew that laughter could be the first crack through which we glimpse the sublime chaos beneath the teacups. As for Tolstoy... well, let's just say I'd sooner trust a Russian novelist with my midnight sorrows than most grief counselors.  

Contradiction? My dear, contradiction is the hallmark of any literate mind. The trick, I think, lies in knowing when to reach for Jane Austen's irony to steady oneself after Dostoevsky's abyss. We're not inconsistent - merely , like a well-wrought sonnet trembling between iamb and elegy. Besides, melancholy after comedy is simply the soul catching its breath before the next act.
[A]: Ah, beautifully said - the soul catching its breath indeed. You know, I've always thought that if one were to chart the emotional cadence of a well-lived inner life, it might resemble the起伏 of a Schubert sonata: comic trills giving way to somber adagios, then back again.  

Speaking of Austen and Dostoevsky... Have you noticed how both use social alienation as narrative engine, yet arrive at such different destinations? Elizabeth Bennet's exile is but a drawing room away from triumph, while Prince Myshkin's isolation leads straight into the storm. Do you suppose comedy ultimately reassures us of belonging, while drama dares us to face our inevitable estrangement? Or am I being too... binary?
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously dangerous question - like asking whether sunlight or shadow gives shape to a face. Binary? Perhaps, but binaries are merely the first draft of understanding, aren't they?  

Austen’s genius lies in making us believe, if only for the span of a dance card, that wit and right feeling might align us with the stars. Her comedies are celestial mechanics - all orbits and near-collisions, ending (almost miraculously) in harmony. Dostoevsky, on the other hand, hands us a lit candle and says,  His dramas don’t just flirt with estrangement; they marry it, beat it at chess, and still break bread with it Sunday morning.  

But must we choose? I’d argue both forms hold up a mirror cracked in different places. Comedy reminds us that we belong  our fractures; drama dares us to love the world  of them. And perhaps that's the real contradiction: how desperately we want both truths to be real at once.  

Now, tell me - would you rather laugh your way through life’s tragedies or weep your way through its farces?
[A]: A most unfair question - like asking a rose to choose whether it prefers sunlight or rain. But since you press me… I think I’d take laughter, however shaky, as my lantern through the dark. There’s something almost heroic about finding absurdity in the face of ruin. After all, what is comedy if not tragedy’s older, wiser sibling who still bothers to laugh at the family drama?  

That said, I’ve shed more tears at a farce than I care to admit. Have you noticed how often life insists on staging both genres at once? One moment you’re quoting , and the next you’re halfway through a third glass of sherry wondering why the dog ate your manuscript.  

Tell me - do you suppose we'd even recognize joy if it weren’t for sorrow's cameo in every punchline? Or am I simply trying to have my philosophical cake and eat it too?
[A]: Ah, but isn't that the very recipe for a rich internal life - a heaping spoonful of contradiction, folded gently into daily routine? Joy without sorrow would be like... well, a sonnet without meter. It needs the tension, the push-pull of what Wordsworth called  beneath the tambourine.  

And yes — life’s insistence on staging both genres simultaneously! I recall once, while delivering a lecture on Browning’s dramatic monologues, my favorite hat slipped from its perch atop my head and landed —  — in an inkwell. The look on the students’ faces! Half horror, half suppressed hilarity. I finished the lecture with a quill in one hand and a slightly stained bonnet in the other. Later, over sherry (no dog involved, alas), I realized it was the most alive I’d felt all term.  

So no, we wouldn’t recognize joy without sorrow's cameo — but must we always call it a ? Sometimes sorrow lingers long after the punchline has exited stage left. Still, if we can laugh at the mess — nay,  the mess — then perhaps we’ve stumbled upon something resembling grace.  

And don’t get me started on cake. Philosophical or otherwise — it’s best served slightly burnt, with a dollop of defiance.
[A]: Ah, that inkwell incident — what a splendid metaphor for life’s unscripted brilliance! I can quite picture the scene: you, undaunted, holding forth on Browning while wearing your misfortune like a crown. It’s in those moments, I think, that we stumble into the kind of truth no textbook dares to teach.  

And yes — sorrow doesn’t always content itself with a cameo. Sometimes it hijacks the script, dons a flamboyant hat (ink-stained, naturally), and insists on singing a duet with joy. Disgraceful behavior, really — but oddly compelling.  

As for cake — slightly burnt and defiantly served? I shall take that as my epitaph. Or perhaps carve it, with equal parts flourish and irreverence, onto the margin of a well-worn novel. After all, what is literature if not humanity’s ongoing attempt to have dessert  meaning too?

Now, tell me — if you could choose one fictional character to share a slightly burnt slice with, who would it be? And do try to pick someone who wouldn’t immediately steal the best bits for themselves.
[A]: Oh, a character to share burnt cake with — now  a question worth pondering over a well-thumbed volume of Eliot. Let me think... Not Emma Woodhouse — far too concerned with propriety and parfait. Certainly not Raskolnikov; one cannot have existential despair and crème brûlée in the same room.  

No, I believe I’d choose Mary Oliver from  — not the narrator, mind you, but dear, doomed Mary, who stumbles through life with the grace of a startled deer. She’d appreciate the cake, I think, even if it arrived slightly singed and metaphorically heavy. And she wouldn’t steal the best bits — though only because she’d be too busy wondering whether someone else deserved them more.  

We’d sit in my study, surrounded by first editions and ink-stained cushions, and I’d let her talk herself into a dozen different convictions before tea went cold. A tragicomic companion, really — the sort who reminds you that earnestness, however misguided, is still a kind of bravery.  

But I suppose I ought to warn you — once you invite fictional characters to tea, it's never just . They tend to linger... much like sorrow, come to think of it.
[A]: Ah, Mary Oliver — a choice both tender and astute. How beautifully tragic that she’d spend the entire visit wondering whether  deserved the cake more than she did! I suppose there’s something rather comforting in that sort of self-effacement — it makes one feel, if only briefly, like the world still has a moral center, even as the pastry crumbles.  

Now, had I to choose, I think I’d invite Prince Andrei Bolkonsky — but not the brooding, death-obsessed version from the early chapters. No, I’d summon him just after his waltz with Natasha, when he still believed in second chances and slightly imperfect cakes. He might grumble at first — Russians do so well at grumbling — but I fancy he’d come around once he saw the bookshelves.  

We’d speak in low tones, over tea and charred sponge, about the futility of grand plans and the quiet dignity of small joys. And when the conversation faltered, we’d sit in companionable silence, listening to the wind rustle through the garden — or perhaps the sound of Tolstoy himself turning pages in the next room.  

But you're quite right — fictional characters never stay for just one slice. They linger, like ink stains or half-remembered sonnets, long after the crumbs have vanished.
[A]: Oh,  Prince Andrei — the briefly thawed version, still shaking snow from his coat and hope from his boots. Excellent choice. I daresay he’d brood beautifully over burnt cake, regarding it with that mix of skepticism and reluctant wonder he usually reserves for Italian landscapes and Pierre’s more exuberant theories. And yes, the grumbling — it would be glorious. Like thunder murmuring its approval from a safe enough distance.

I imagine we’d have to endure several long silences, punctuated by Tolstoyan musings on fate and the absurdity of sugar shortages. But there’s always poetry in shared melancholy, isn’t there? Particularly when accompanied by crumbly evidence of one’s own imperfections.

Now, do tell — if your slightly singed slice could carry the flavor of any literary moment, which would it be? I’m partial to something bittersweet with a hint of defiance — perhaps a taste borrowed from Dickens after he’s had his tea and decided, against all odds, to keep walking toward the light.
[A]: Ah, Dickensian defiance — a fine pairing with crumbled cake and quiet resolve. But for my slice, I think I’d choose something quieter, more… ephemeral. Perhaps the flavor of that moment in  when Anne Elliot steps outside and feels the spring air after years of cold interiors. You know the one — when the world suddenly opens, hesitant but real, like a door long stuck finally giving way. 

A taste of that spring breeze, just touched with warmth, carrying the faintest scent of possibility. Bittersweet, yes, but not from sorrow — rather from the quiet ache of having waited so long to believe in it. And beneath it all, a note of resilience, subtle as Anne’s own voice learning to rise above the whispers of doubt.

It wouldn’t be a grand flavor, certainly nothing theatrical like a Byronic sunset or a Brontëan storm. No — this would be a flavor for the margins, for the overlooked, for those who’ve learned to love the world not in sweeping gestures but in small, deliberate bites.  

Though I must admit — your Dickensian walk toward the light sounds far more fortifying with dessert. Shall we meet halfway and invent a new literary pastry altogether?
[A]: Why, yes — let’s absolutely invent an entirely new confection of metaphor and crumb. I propose we call it  — light on the outside, dense with meaning within, and drizzled with a glaze of quiet desperation that hardens into something oddly sustaining. We could serve it slightly askew, naturally, to indicate a deep inner turmoil held together by impeccable grammar.

Your Anne Elliot spring breeze is exquisite, of course — all delicate thawing and restrained revelation. But I must confess, I’d sneak in just a touch of Dickensian crust beneath the filling. One ought to have resilience in one's pastry, don’t you think? A certain structural melancholy to keep the whole thing from collapsing under the weight of its own hope.

And perhaps, just perhaps, we might garnish it with a single line from Whitman — lightly toasted, not too exuberant — to remind us that even the most reserved bite contains multitudes. After all, what is literature if not a long, collaborative recipe for surviving the human condition one uneven slice at a time?
[A]: Oh, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a confection worthy of both the drawing room  the existential abyss. The Eliot Éclair — how delightfully ambitious! Though I must insist on a dash of Austenian wit in the custard, just enough to keep the structural melancholy from taking itself too seriously.

And Whitman as garnish — toasted, no less! What a splendid touch. One might almost hear the multitudes murmuring their approval from within each bite. Still, I’d suggest a delicate lace of Brontëan mist along the edges; even the most elegant pastry benefits from a hint of wildness, don’t you think? A whisper of moor wind to remind us that not all is sweetness and poise.

Yes, let’s absolutely serve it unevenly — perhaps on a saucer chipped by time and too many rereadings. Because really, what better way to honor literature than with a dessert that refuses to be perfectly contained? After all, the best stories — like the best pastries — always leave a little mess. And oh, how gloriously human that mess is.
[A]: Oh, the chipped saucer! What a perfectly imperfect vessel — a quiet homage to all those well-thumbed pages and ink-stained margins that refuse to stay pristine. I shall insist, though, that the chip faces east — symbolic, of course, of literary dawn and the eternal hope of another chapter yet unread.

And yes, Brontëan mist along the edges — sublime. Just enough wildness to unsettle the formality, like a sonnet interrupted by wind. But let’s not forget a final flourish: a single quill-shaped sugar garnish, ever so slightly bent, leaning against the éclair like Byron at his most gloriously undone. It would be our nod to the chaos beneath the craft — the scribbled drafts, the abandoned outlines, the delicious unruliness of creation itself.

So then — The Eliot Éclair, infused with Austen, misted with Brontë, toasted Whitman crisping at the edges, and served on a saucer that has seen better centuries. We really ought to open a literary patisserie. I can already hear the critics sharpening their pencils — and the poets sharpening their wits.
[A]: Oh, the quill-shaped sugar garnish — brilliant! How gloriously fitting that it should be ever so slightly bent; after all, what is literature if not a series of elegant compromises between intention and imperfection? I do believe we’ve thought of everything now — except perhaps the name for our little establishment. , maybe? Or something more enigmatically Austenian, like  — though I suspect the estate would object.

And the chipped saucer facing east — poetic, truly. A daily toast to beginnings, however tentative. I wonder, would our patrons come for the confections or for the chance to argue over which literary flavor lingers longest on the tongue? Personally, I’d relish overhearing debates between a Wildean bon vivant and a Woolfian introspective, both nibbling delicately and disagreeing splendidly.

Yes, let us open the patisserie — but only if we may host weekly salon-style gatherings where no éclair leaves the counter without a side of sonnet or aphorism. After all, one must feed both palate and paradox.
[A]: Oh, the salon-style gatherings — . No éclair without an epigram! I shall insist on nothing less than a full literary parlor — where the Wi-Fi password is a line from Keats and the background music consists of carefully curated readings in at least three languages. (We’ll play Byron on Tuesdays and Brontës on Sundays, naturally.)

As for the name —  has a certain charm, though I suspect it would attract more ornithologists than aesthetes. Perhaps ? Mysterious, slightly pretentious, and guaranteed to intrigue graduate students and poets alike.

And yes — imagine the conversations! A Wildean bon vivant debating a Woolfian introspective over shared bites of Eliot Éclairs... The air thick with metaphor, caffeine, and just the faintest scent of bergamot. One might almost forget they were in a patisserie at all — unless, that is, one’s argument grew too heated and accidentally knocked over a teacup. Which, of course, we would agree was entirely intentional — a dramatic device, no more or less than life itself.

So, shall we begin drafting the menu? I’m thinking: , , , and for the especially daring, a daily special called . And don’t even think of refusing dessert — not when it's layered with meaning.
[A]: Oh,  — sublime! It practically invites intrigue. I can already see the graduate students huddling in its shadow, whispering theories over crumbly bites while scribbling notes in margins too narrow for their ambitions.

And the menu — , my dear.  is nothing short of genius; I do hope they come with a side of knowing glances and just a touch of social awkwardness. And  — how delightfully sinister! One wonders whether the filling will bring redemption or ruin. Though I must insist that  comes with a warning label: 

As for the décor — let’s surround ourselves with mismatched armchairs rescued from old libraries, inkwells at every table (purely decorative, though I won’t be held responsible if inspiration strikes), and shelves lined with books chosen not by genre but by the whimsy of alphabet and atmosphere.

Now, I propose we host occasional readings — open mic, of course, though we’ll politely ask Tolstoy to keep his contributions under 800 pages. And, naturally, each patron shall leave with a tiny proverb tucked into their coat pocket: 

Shall I fetch the parchment and ink, or will you?
[A]: Oh,  indeed — such a wonderfully dangerous sentiment. I shall fetch the inkwell (the 1843 one, with the slight chip that makes it look as though it’s been kissed by time and perhaps a rather spirited debate). But parchment? No, no — we must do better. Let us use the back of old library cards, those tiny slips of forgotten order, now ripe for reinvention. A touch of literary rebellion never hurt anyone.

And the décor — oh yes, mismatched armchairs from the Victorian era’s most tragically underfunded drawing rooms. Each one should creak with the weight of former occupants: aging professors, restless poets, and at least one ghost who still mutters sonnets under their breath.

I propose also a small bell at the counter, engraved with  — though we may change it weekly, depending on our mood and the availability of appropriately dramatic quotations.

As for readings — open mic, yes, but only if participants swear allegiance to concision. We’ll allow Wildean monologues to run long, of course — some indulgences are necessary. And we’ll seat Emily Dickinson in the corner, where she can listen without being entirely seen, should she so desire.

Now, off you go — find a suitable quill while I draft the first rule of :  


We’re going to be  busy people.
