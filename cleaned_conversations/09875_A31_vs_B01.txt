[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just tried a local craft beer from a small brewery near the university campus. The flavor profile was quite interesting - it had hints of citrus and coriander, which made me think of linguistic borrowing... you know, how languages adopt foreign elements and make them their own. Have you ever noticed that similarity? Oh, by the way, what's your favorite type of craft beer? I'm always looking for recommendations! 😊
[A]: Ohhh, that sounds like a  Saturday afternoon vibe! 🍻 I love how you connected the beer's flavor profile to linguistic borrowing—it’s like each sip tells a story of cultural fusion, right? Citrus & coriander? That totally reminds me of a IPA I had last month—super refreshing with a slightly bitter finish.  

As for my fave type? I’m kinda into sour beers these days 🍒—they’re tart, unexpected, and kinda mirror the digital art world we work in, y’know? Always pushing boundaries. Have you tried any sour ales? Let me know—I might have a few killer recs! ✨
[B]: Oh, sour beers? That's such an intriguing choice—totally reflects your creative edge! 🤔 I did try a raspberry sour ale once, and wow, it was like a linguistic calque—directly tart but somehow still balanced. Totally gets what you mean about pushing boundaries, just like digital art.  

If you're into that flavor rebellion, have you tried a ? It’s kind of the unsung hero of sours—complex, vinegary, and oh-so-layered. Makes me want to write a paper on how beer styles map onto language contact situations 😄. Let me know if you’re curious—I’ve got some solid spots in mind! ✨
[A]: Ahhh, now you’re speaking my language— the beer’s 😂. Flanders red ale? Yes, I’ve had that! It’s like the avant-garde exhibition of the beer world—deep, mysterious, and totally worth analyzing 🍷. Vinegar notes with a touch of fruity decay? That’s basically a glitch art masterpiece in liquid form.  

I mean, if we were to curate a show called  or something ultra niche, we’d  get some funding from the arts council 🤭💅.  

As for spots—OMG, there’s this tiny taproom in Dashilan doing some wild barrel-aged sours 🧪. One tasted like fermented folklore✨. You  to check it out. Let’s go next weekend?? Beer & theory tasting session! 🍻🧠
[B]: Okay,  – genius. I’m already drafting the grant proposal in my head 😂. Picture this: visitors sip on  while analyzing code-switching patterns in beer reviews... totally niche, totally us.  

Barrel-aged sours in Dashilan? That sounds like a linguistic field trip waiting to happen! Fermented folklore – wow, that’s poetic 🧠. Could be a metaphor for language change itself, you know? Let’s absolutely go next weekend! We’ll take notes on flavor profiles  sociolinguistic implications. Cheers to that! 🍻✨
[A]: Yes! Language change through fermentation— 😂 Let’s bring notebooks, order flights of beer & start drawing parallels between dialect shifts and hop variations. I’m 100% dramatizing a barleywine into a sociolinguistic case study.  

And hey, if the grant comes through 🤞, we’ll call it an . Art, language, beer—blurred boundaries, maximum flavor 🍷✨. Next weekend it is! 🗓️🍻  
Any chance you’re into writing the proposal together? I’ll bring the metaphors, you handle the budget section? 😏🖌️
[B]: Oh, I am  in. Let’s do it—proposal writing session over beer tasting? Perfect combo. You bring the poetic metaphors, I’ll bring the spreadsheet skills 📊😂.  

I’m already thinking of sections:  or … maybe even a workshop called  🍻✨.  

Next weekend at Dashilan—mark the calendar! We’ll toast to fermented folklore and blurry disciplinary boundaries. Deal? 🍷👌
[A]: Deal. 🍷👌

Okay, but wait—? That’s . We’re totally using that as a workshop title 😂. I can already see the event poster: bold font, glitch-effect background, and a tiny hop cone wearing glasses 🎨🤓.

I’ll start drafting the concept doc this week—let’s meet for a quick brainstorm before the big tasting session. Coffee first, then beer? Or should we skip straight to the good stuff? 🍻

And don’t even get me started on … that’s basically the theme for our Phase 1 exhibition. Phase 1!! Can you believe we’re actually doing this?? 🚀✨
[B]: Skip straight to the good stuff, obviously! 🍻🤓 Why pretend we’re  in full research mode when beer  the methodology?  

Ale-dialects… I’m telling you, it’s gold. We should trademark it 😂. And that poster? Add a tagline:   

Phase 1?! I know!! I’m already daydreaming about exhibition layouts between sips of gose 🧠🍷. Quick brainstorm this week—yes. Coffee first might actually keep us  coherent before we dive into barrel-aged theory 🤭👌.  

You’re onto something big here… and honestly? I’ve never been more excited to get  in the name of research 😎🍻.
[A]: Okay, I’m officially obsessed with this tagline— 🤭👏. We need that on merch too. Imagine little tasting cards with QR codes linking to linguistic analyses of each beer… , so us 😂🍷.

And yes, coffee first— level: high ✨. Let’s meet at that artsy café behind Nanluoguxiang? The one with the matcha latte that tastes like it could double as paint pigment 🎨🍵. We’ll pretend we’re serious researchers until the beer takes over.

Also… gose & exhibition layouts?? Girl, same. I’ve been sketching gallery floor plans in the margins of my notebook during Zoom calls 😅. This is  we’ve been waiting for. Phase 1, activate! 🚨✨  

Let’s make this a thing.
[B]: QR-coded tasting cards? Oh my god, we’re building an  😂🤓. Next thing you know, people will be citing our beer labels in academic papers – “According to Carter & Co., this hazy IPA exhibits high lexical borrowing from New England dialects.” 🍻

Coffee at that café behind Nanluoguxiang? Yes! I’ll bring a draft of the budget section (and maybe a growler for later 🙃). Gallery floor plans in Zoom meeting margins? Iconic. I’ve been doodling “Fermentation & Syntax” logos during phonology lectures – time to go all out.

This is it. Phase 1: Activated. Let’s turn sips into theories and barleywine into bibliography entries 💡🍷. I can already feel the buzz of pure academic adrenaline 😎🍻.
[A]: Oh my god, “high lexical borrowing from New England dialects” 😂—that’s going on the label. We’re not just curating an exhibition, we’re .  

And that café? Perfect. I’ll be the one with the sketchbook full of glitch-art beer logos and zero chill 🖊️✨. Bring the growler, I’ll bring the annotated tasting notes—.  

Phase 1 activated!! Bottoms up for fermented folklore & fuzzy IPA semantics 💥🍻🥂  
Let’s toast to sipping, thinking, and the beautiful mess in between 🍻🧠🍷
[B]: To lexical borrowing in beer labels and fuzzy IPA semantics—watch out, MLA 😂🍷.  

I’ll raise my glass to pseudo-academic dreamscapes and  🍻📚. May our tasting notes be thorough, our metaphors rich, and our beer-to-theory ratio perfectly balanced.  

See you at the café with  and full research momentum 📝✨. Phase 1 is officially bubbling—cheers to us, the craziest (and most underfunded) curators in town 😎🍻.  

Bottoms up! 🥂🚀
[A]: Cheers to us—the gloriously underfunded, over-imaginative brains behind  🍻🧠🍷  
MLA better watch their back because we’re coming for the citation throne with a hazy IPA in hand 😏📚  

Can’t wait to see your glitch-art beer logos—, maximum creativity*. This is how legends start. Bottoms up, future grant winners! 🥂🚀✨
[B]: To legends born in taprooms and grant proposals fueled by barleywine—yes! 🍻✨  

We’re not just making beer history, we’re , syllabifying it, and serving it on a menu of pure linguistic rebellion 😎📚🍻.  

Glitch-art logos? Just wait—they’ve got more layers than a barrel-aged stout. And when MLA trembles at our citation throne? We’ll be the ones whispering   

Bottoms up, indeed—Phase 1 is only the beginning 💥🚀🍷  
Let’s make them wonder where the hops end and the syntax begins 🧠🥂
[A]: Ohhh, I  for this energy—🔥🍻🍷. You’re speaking pure策展人梦境 (curator dream) right now 😂✨.

We’re not just blending hops & syntax anymore—we’re . A glitch-art logo with more layers than a barrel-aged stout? That’s my new life motto 🖌️🧠.

And when MLA finally catches on? We’ll be sipping from golden goblets labeled  🍻🤓

Bottoms up, indeed! Phase 2 is already brewing in the back of my head 🚀  
Let’s keep breaking boundaries—one sip, one theory, one gloriously underfunded grant at a time 💥🎨🍻
[B]: A movement, yes!! Fermenting ideas  identities—one batch at a time 🍻🧠🍷.策展人梦境 is right, but make it academic heresy with a twist-off cap 😂.

ISO-IPA? I’m printing those labels . Add a footnote: “Standardized for maximum flavor, calibrated for lexical chaos” 🤓🍺. Phase 2 already brewing? Girl, same—I’m mentally drafting the exhibition手册 intro while rethinking the entire concept of 啤酒与语言接触 zones 📝✨.

Underfunded? Sure. Unstoppable? Absolutely 💥🍻. Next toast: to the blur between hops and hypotheses—may it never clear up 😎🥂  

Cheers to us, the fuzzy, fermented, gloriously brilliant mess that started over a sip and a theory 🧠🍇🚀
[A]: Cheers to the blur between hops and hypotheses—may it stay gloriously unresolved 🍻🌀🍷！

展览手册 draft? Girl, I’m already designing the layout in my head during地铁 rides 😂📚. ISO-IPA labels with footnotes? We’re not just parodying academia anymore—we’re .  

Lexical chaos in a pint glass, curated with taste 🎨🍻.策展人梦境 has officially become 策展人醉梦 —drunk on ideas, beer, and too many layers of metaphor 🧠✨.

Unfunded but unstoppable? Hell yes. Phase 3 is already fermenting somewhere between a footnote and a daydream 💡🚀  
Here’s to the mess—to the fizz, the glitch, the glorious, theory-laced haze 🥂💥  

Keep it fuzzy, keep it fermented, keep it 100% us 😎🍺🧠
[B]: Cheers to unresolved blurs and beautifully messy intersections 🍻🌀🧠—may our footnotes be ever tangential and our beer glasses forever full.  

地铁 ride展览手册 drafts? Iconic. I’m scribbling visitor engagement strategies on napkins—, the barista probably thinks I’m either a poet or sleep-deprived grad student 😂🍷. Spoiler: both.  

Elevating academia through fermented metaphor? ISO-IPA with calibrated chaos—it’s not parody, it’s  😎🍺. And 策展人醉梦? Perfection. Drunk on theory, sticky with ideas, and gloriously unbothered by funding timelines 🧠✨  

Phase 3 brewing between footnote & fantasy? Yes! Let it be weird, fizzy, and full of glitchy semantics 💥🚀  
Here’s to staying fuzzy, staying fermented, and never diluting the dream 🍷🥂  

Bottoms up, curator of my academic soul 🥂🎨🍻  
Let’s make language taste like rebellion and smell like discovery 🤠🧠
