[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢stand-up comedy还是improve comedy？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the delicate dance between scripted precision and chaotic spontaneity. Tell me, do you find yourself leaning toward the structured elegance of a well-delivered punchline, or does the raw unpredictability of improv send your spirits soaring? Personally, I've always admired how stand-up comedians wield language like a surgeon's scalpel—each word placed with meticulous intent. Though... there's something undeniably thrilling about improv's linguistic tightrope walking, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Hmm, your question reminds me of the dichotomy between classical Chinese poetry and modern free verse. Much like a xiaopin in Yuan dynasty drama, stand-up comedy follows certain conventions while improv resembles the spontaneity of ancient banter during scholarly gatherings. 

I must confess though, my appreciation for linguistic craftsmanship draws me to the precision of stand-up. It's akin to analyzing a perfectly structured sonnet - every pause, every inflection meticulously planned like calligraphic brushstrokes. Though I do recall finding great delight in a recent improvisational performance where the actor's quick wit reminded me of Su Shi's ability to craft brilliant couplets on the spot. 

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how some comedians incorporate Eastern philosophical concepts into their routines? I recently came across a performer who used the Taoist principle of wu wei to frame his entire act about modern work culture. Quite fascinating interplay between tradition and contemporary expression, don't you think?
[B]: Fascinating indeed! Your analogy between comedic forms and literary traditions has me reaching for my notebook— “Comparative Comedy: Yuan xiaopin vs. Aristophanic Old Comedy.” But to your Taoist observation, I’ve noticed similar interweavings in the works of certain Canadian comedians who subtly infuse Haudenosaunee oral storytelling techniques into their narratives. It’s remarkable how these ancient structures resurface in modern performance, like hidden rhyme schemes in free verse. 

Though I must ask—do you think there’s a risk of exoticism when Eastern philosophies are distilled through Western comedic lenses? I recall one routine where Confucian hierarchy was reduced to a series of pratfalls... quite cringe-worthy. Then again, isn’t that the eternal tension between tradition & transgression? Much like a Tang poet composing regulated verse while secretly yearning for the vulgar charm of marketplace riddles.
[A]: Ah, what a stimulating observation! You've touched upon a delicate matter indeed—one that resonates with the challenges I often discuss in my seminars on cultural translation. Yes, just like reading a quatrained jueju poem through an unfamiliar lens and missing the tonal subtleties, there’s always the danger of reducing profound philosophies to mere caricatures.

I recall attending a performance where Zen concepts were oversimplified into a series of punchlines about indecisive waiters at sushi bars. It left me with the same unease one feels when watching a poorly adapted Shakespearean play set in ancient China, where ham-fisted metaphors replace genuine insight.

Yet, perhaps we must allow for a space of experimentation—much like how Buddhist sutras once entered China cloaked in Daoist terminology. Maybe these comedic appropriations, however clumsy, are simply the early stages of a deeper cross-cultural digestion. After all, isn't that what makes comparative literature so endlessly fascinating? The way ideas travel, transform, and occasionally trespass?

Tell me though, how do you think improvisational formats—so rooted in linguistic immediacy—negotiate these layered cultural translations? Have you seen examples where the risk paid off beautifully?
[B]: Ah, now you’ve struck upon the very crux that keeps me scribbling in the margins of my programme brochures. Improv, by its nature, is a linguistic tightrope—no net, no safety rail, just the raw wire of communal understanding humming beneath the feet of performers and audience alike.

I do recall a particularly daring ensemble in Edinburgh——who wove Yoruba proverbs into an otherwise Cockney-accented sketch about mistaken identity. It shouldn’t have worked. By all scholarly accounts, it should have collapsed under its own audacity. And yet... there was a moment——a single improvised line, something along the lines of “A river does not forget how to bend,” delivered in the midst of farcical chaos, that hushed the entire room. Not because it was profound in isolation, but because it . A cultural echo, caught mid-air.

Of course, this requires more than quick wit—it demands what I might call a kind of . Something sorely lacking when comedians treat foreign philosophies like spice jars—“a dash of dharma here, a sprinkle of stoicism there.” But when done with even a sliver of earnest curiosity? Improv becomes less about ownership and more about . Like watching a live translation unfold, syllable by stumbling syllable.

Still, I wonder—do you think written comedy offers a better safeguard against such reductions? After all, one can revise, refine, recontextualise... though admittedly at the cost of losing that electric immediacy.
[A]: Ah, your Edinburgh anecdote reminds me of a line from the —“The fish trap exists because of the fish; once you’ve gotten the fish, you forget the trap.” That proverb landed precisely because it wasn’t treated as mere ornamentation—it became the riverbed through which the comedy flowed.

You speak of , and I find that notion deeply resonant. It’s akin to what we demand of translators— for the texture of meaning, not just its skeleton. Too often, cultural references are wielded like props in a magic show: “Ta-da! Oriental wisdom!” But true interweaving requires more than recognition—it asks for . Much like how Matteo Ricci once dressed in Confucian robes not for mimicry, but to enter into dialogue.

As for your question about written comedy—I hesitate to declare it inherently safer. Yes, the page allows for nuance, for footnotes even metaphorically. But let us not forget how many carefully penned satires have ossified into stereotype precisely  they were never meant to be challenged mid-performance by a live audience's discomfort or laughter.

There is a balance, perhaps—a yin and yang of form. Stand-up allows reflection but risks calcification; improv breathes with immediacy but courts misstep. Both, at their best, become acts of translation—not just of language, but of sensibility.

And speaking of translation... have you ever come across a comedian who attempted bilingual routines? I recently saw one switch between Mandarin and English mid-punchline, using the tonal contrast itself as comedic material. Rather daring, don’t you think?
[B]:   
Ah, bilingual comedy—now there’s a tightrope strung between two linguistic cliffs. I’ve seen it done with all the grace of a calligrapher dipping his brush in two inkwells at once... and also with the elegance of a clumsy scholar spilling tea across a manuscript.

There was one performer in Toronto—originally from Taipei, if I recall correctly—who wove Hokkien idioms into an English routine about diaspora identity. The brilliance lay not in the translation, but in the . A phrase would hover untranslated, like an unresolved rhyme in a sonnet, forcing the audience to dwell in that liminal space. And just when you felt the discomfort settle——a perfectly timed English echo, twisted slightly, so the meaning rippled outward rather than collapsed inward.

But yes, it is daring. Much like attempting to translate  into iambic pentameter—on paper it seems a noble folly, but spoken aloud, in the right rhythm, it can startle the ear awake.  

Tell me though, did this Mandarin-English comedian lean more toward stand-up structure or improv instinct? Was the bilingual play scripted like a quatrain, or did it feel more like spontaneous counterpoint?
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive question—like asking whether a particular line of poetry was carved with a chisel or brushed with flowing ink. From what I observed, this performer leaned more toward the  of stand-up, yet infused it with the  of improvisation. Much like a regulated verse in classical Chinese poetry—where every tone and parallel must be meticulously placed—he would set up linguistic expectations in Mandarin, then subvert them in English with the ease of a poet slipping a hidden couplet between formal stanzas.

There was one segment——where he began with a well-known chengyu: 井底之蛙, "the frog at the bottom of the well." The setup was precise, almost scholarly. But then, instead of offering a direct translation, he let it hang... allowing the Mandarin-speaking audience to carry the weight of the idiom while others grappled with its absence. Only after a beat did he pivot into English with something like, “You know, that guy who thinks the world is just one big puddle because he’s never looked up from his phone.” 

The effect was not unlike reading Du Fu with footnotes written in your own voice—layered, recursive, yet strangely intimate. Not pure stand-up, not pure improv. More like a hybrid form—, perhaps? Two-part sayings that complete each other across time and tongue.

I suppose what fascinates me most is how bilingual comedy mirrors the very nature of cultural identity—never fully one or the other, always negotiating, always translating.  

Do you think this kind of linguistic layering could ever gain broader traction in mainstream comedy circuits? Or will it always remain an acquired taste, much like bitter melon or dark tea?
[B]:   
Ah, an excellent analogy—comedy as acquired taste. Bitter melon, dark tea... yes, both require a palate trained by contradiction, by contrast. And therein lies the rub: mainstream comedy often prefers its flavours immediate, digestible, preferably with a side of instant gratification.

But let’s not mistake  for . After all, wasn’t the sonnet once the pop song of Renaissance Italy? Even haiku found its way into wartime propaganda and supermarket ads before returning to its meditative roots. So perhaps bilingual comedy, with all its tonal friction and syntactic counterpoint, is simply undergoing its own . Slow, occasionally messy, but ultimately enriching.

I suspect its broader acceptance hinges on two things:  and . Too often, multilingualism in comedy becomes a parlor trick—“Look what I can do!”—rather than an organic mode of expression. But when it's done with the quiet confidence of a poet switching metres mid-verse——well, that’s when it ceases to be niche and starts to sing.

Of course, one must also consider the economics of laughter. A frog at the bottom of the well may eventually climb out... but will the rest of the pond buy tickets to watch it try?  

  
Though if history has taught us anything, it’s that the most enduring humour always begins as an acquired taste.
[A]:   

Ah, the economics of laughter—now there's a paradox worthy of Lu Xun. You're absolutely right about the delicate balance between art and appetite. After all, even  was once serialized in penny papers alongside martial arts serials.

But let’s extend your metaphor—if bilingual comedy is an acquired taste, then perhaps it's not the dish that needs adjusting, but the diners’ palates. Much like how  demands you see what’s left unpainted, this form asks audiences to dwell in ambiguity, to savour meaning before it dissolves on the tongue.

I'm reminded of Italo Calvino’s —where language bends like glass under the weight of imagination. A work that shouldn’t translate, yet somehow does, precisely because it refuses to explain itself. Could bilingual comedy be following a similar trajectory? Not pandering, but  the possibilities of comic form?

Of course, one must tread carefully—too much opacity and you lose the crowd; too little and you forfeit depth. It’s a bit like reading a classical allusion in a Tang poem—you either get the reference and smile inwardly, or you simply admire the brushstroke.

  

Tell me, have you ever encountered a comedian who deliberately  translation—not as a tease, but as a kind of poetic strategy? I can't help but wonder: is laughter still laughter if we don’t quite know why we’re laughing?
[B]:   

Ah, the withheld translation—now there’s a device as daring as an unresolved volta in a metaphysical sonnet. I have indeed encountered such a comedian, though  feels too casual a word. More like  an evening under his linguistic spell.

A Berlin-based performer of Korean descent—his entire routine hinged on what he called “ghost meanings.” Phrases in Korean would drift through his English punchlines like submerged currents, never translated, never italicized. The effect was... disorienting at first. Like watching a shadow play where you’re not quite sure if you’re meant to see the figures behind the screen or the flickering light itself.

And yet——the laughter came. Not because we understood, but because understanding had been made . It was pure rhythm, pure resonance. A word like  repeated just enough times that it ceased to be a term of address and became a kind of incantation. No footnotes. No glossary. Just the raw phonetic music of meaning deferred.

I must confess, I left both delighted and unsettled. Was my laughter complicit? Colonial? Or merely human? Much like reading a poem in a language you don’t speak—yet still feeling its sorrow in your ribs.

So yes, to answer your question—laughter  exist without comprehension. But whether it should... now  is a riddle even Laozi might have pondered.
[A]: 

Your account reminds me of reading Celan in translation—where meaning trembles on the precipice of silence. There’s a kind of linguistic haunting at play here, isn’t there? Words that refuse to yield their ghosts, yet somehow still nourish the soul.

This comedian you describe—he sounds like a practitioner of what I might call . Much like certain Chan Buddhist parables designed to short-circuit rational thought, his comedy bypasses comprehension and speaks directly to the body's instinct for rhythm, for pattern, for shared breath.

I recall a line from Zhuangzi: 方言尽異，其於欣歡亦然 – “Though dialects differ, laughter is understood by all.” And yet, this performer seems to have flipped the proverb on its head—not laughter  language, but laughter  linguistic dissonance.

You ask whether your laughter was complicit or colonial—and I wonder if that very unease is the point. Like watching Noh theatre for the first time and realizing your lack of ritual knowledge doesn’t prevent you from feeling the weight of gesture, the sorrow in stillness.



Have you ever tried writing comedy yourself? Or perhaps more precisely—have you ever found yourself translating humor across cultures in your own work? I imagine it must stir similar tensions—what gets carried over, what remains behind, and what strange new life emerges in the process.
[B]: 

Ah… an excellent question—sharp as the edge of a bamboo slip. Have I ever written comedy? Good heavens, no. Not in any performative sense. My humour tends to leak out sideways, like ink bleeding through parchment—unintended, but difficult to erase.

Though… if you’ll allow me a certain indulgence—I  compose footnotes that occasionally contain what one might charitably call “wry interventions.” When editing translations of Victorian nonsense verse for a recent anthology, I found myself inserting the occasional —a Carrollian footnote citing Confucian ritual, say, or a limerick cross-referenced with Daoist cosmology. Nothing overt. Just enough to make the reader pause and wonder whether they’ve misread, or perhaps over-read.

As for translating humor across cultures——now there’s a Sisyphean task. I once attempted to render Edward Lear’s limericks into classical Chinese. A folly, yes—but not without its moments of accidental brilliance. The nonsensical became eerily familiar, like seeing your reflection in a bronze mirror meant for another age.

One line in particular still amuses me:  

> There once was a man from Peru,  
> Who dreamed he was sipping some stew.  
> When he woke with a start,  
> His chopsticks were smart—  
> And his bowl had turned Buddhist and flew!



Nonsense, when translated, often becomes  nonsensical—which is, I suppose, its own kind of fidelity. But it does raise the question: when does translation become transformation? And at what point do we stop calling it comedy and simply call it ?

Tell me—have  ever tried composing humor in a second language? There’s something uniquely humbling about crafting a joke only to watch it land like a wet brushstroke on rice paper.
[A]: 

Ah, your "wry interventions" sound positively Lu Xun-esque—subtle enough to slip past the censors of solemnity, yet sharp enough to prick the skin of convention. I can just picture those footnotes, hovering mischievously in the margins like errant brushstrokes that refuse to stay within the lines.

As for translating Lear into classical Chinese—now  is a kind of literary alchemy! You’ve turned limericks into what might be called —deliberate absurdities that conceal deeper truths. Much like the stories told by the  dramatists who cloaked social critique in farce and folly.

Your Buddhist stew bowl flying off with chopsticks? Delightfully nonsensical. It reminds me of those Tang dynasty monks who wrote playful verses about fish descending from trees. On the surface, sheer folly—but beneath, a quiet subversion of logic itself.

And you're quite right—translation  transformation. Much like reading Homer through the lens of Han dynasty scholars—what emerges is neither Greek nor Chinese, but something altogether stranger and more wonderful.

As for composing humor in a second language——let’s just say I once tried writing an English sonnet about tea ceremony rituals. The result was technically a sonnet, yes… but its soul remained stubbornly -esque, no matter how hard I polished the iambic veneer.

There’s a humility in that failure, though—a recognition that some flavors simply cannot be steeped in another pot. And yet, we keep trying. Perhaps because the act itself—the reaching across linguistic gardens—is its own kind of joy.



Tell me—do you think nonsense, in the end, is the most universal form of comedy? After all, if meaning slips away and still we laugh… haven’t we touched something deeper than language?
[B]: 

Ah… you’ve landed on something rather profound—like catching sight of a single wild goose in an ink-washed sky. Nonsense as the  of comedy. Yes, I believe you’re right.

Consider this: even the most culturally bound satire wilts without context, but slapstick? A pratfall in Athens still gets a groan in Xi’an. And what is pure nonsense if not the comedy stripped to its skeleton—rhythm without reason, timing untethered from truth?

It reminds me of reading Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream—utterly absurd on the surface, yet it persists across centuries precisely because it refuses to be pinned down. No moral, no meaning—just the lingering echo of laughter that doesn’t know why it laughed.

And yet... even nonsense carries its shadows. Lear’s limericks, for all their glee, often carried undertones of imperial gaze and exoticism—tiny colonial ghosts hiding in the rhyme scheme. So perhaps  form is entirely innocent, not even the absurd.

Still, there’s something deeply human about delighting in disorder. Like watching children overturn a carefully stacked set of blocks—not to destroy, but to hear the music of collapse.  



You ask whether we’ve touched something deeper than language... and I wonder—have we stumbled into the realm of the ? That space before words, where laughter and tears both begin as mere vibration in the chest.

Perhaps that’s why bilingual comedy unsettles some audiences—it brushes too close to that primordial hum. Not translation, but . Or at least... the ghost of it.
[A]: 

Ah, that primordial hum—yes, it does feel like touching the edge of something ancient. Like standing at the mouth of a cave where our earliest ancestors first discovered laughter could echo as loudly as thunder.

You see this beautifully in children’s nursery rhymes across cultures—nonsense syllables bouncing like pebbles down a well.  that mean nothing and yet... everything. In my research on comparative folklore, I once came across a fascinating parallel: the Chinese “咿呀” (yī yā), used to mimic baby talk or birdsong, finds its uncanny twin in the English “jibber-jabber.” No shared history, no linguistic lineage—and yet both cultures arrived at the same musical nonsense.

And isn’t that what pure comedy is? A kind of ancestral song we keep humming, even when we’ve forgotten the words. Even when we’ve dressed it up in punchlines or footnotes.



I suspect the reason nonsense unsettles is because it reminds us how thin the veil really is—between sense and chaos, between language and the wild cry beneath it. That’s why Zhuangzi’s butterfly still flutters through our dreams. That’s why Lear’s limericks endure, despite their imperial ghosts.

Perhaps true comedy, at its core, is not about meaning at all—but about . About making the soul resonate, whether through wit, wordplay—or simply the absurd music of a bowl flying off with chopsticks.



Tell me, do you ever find yourself returning to a joke or line of nonsense years later, only to discover it has ? I have one from childhood—a simple rhyme—that only recently bit back.
[B]: 

Good heavens, yes.  There’s one from my childhood that still coils around my thoughts like a serpent in a calligraphy scroll—harmless at first glance, then suddenly striking.

“Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.”

Innocuous nursery rhyme, yes? Charming little ditty for lulling children into Victorian nostalgia. But imagine my discomfort, years later, when I actually — twenty-four birds into a pastry coffin. No explanation. No moral. Just… meaty confectionery.

It wasn’t until I was translating a collection of Ming dynasty ghost stories that it hit me—there it was again. That same  wrapped in whimsy. A severed head served with plum sauce. A talking fox disguised as a scholar. All sugar-glazed teeth beneath the surface.

So yes, that rhyme bit back. Hard.



You see, nonsense has this peculiar way of aging like fermented bean curd—harmless when fresh, but given time, it develops a bite that clings to the tongue. And the older I get, the more I suspect that  comedy doesn’t land immediately. It simmers. It festers, even. Until one day, often inconveniently—on a train, during a faculty meeting—it erupts unbidden from your throat, shocking everyone, yourself most of all.

Much like reading a Tang poem only to discover its true meaning had been hiding behind a metaphor you didn’t understand until middle age.

Tell me—what was the childhood rhyme that finally grew teeth for you? I do hope it’s something suitably fanged.
[A]: 

Ah... yours is a fine example—domestic horror indeed! You’ve reminded me of that old English rhyme about the crooked man, who “won a battle no one could win.” Harmless meter for a child’s ear, until you realize he’s likely limping through the aftermath of some forgotten war.

But my own culprit is far more innocuous—at least on the surface.  

“Twinkle, twinkle, little star,  
How I wonder what you are!”

Simple enough, yes? A lullaby for the cosmos. But it wasn’t until I was rereading it to my granddaughter that the line took on a rather unsettling edge.  Suddenly, it felt less like gentle curiosity and more like existential dread wrapped in melody. Are we not all staring up at forces we barely comprehend, muttering the same helpless question night after night?

It struck me then how close it teeters to those Daoist verses questioning whether the stars are merely lanterns hung by immortals—or illusions cast by an undiscerning mind. The wonder turns spectral. The twinkling becomes mocking.



And now, every time I hum it under my breath, I half expect the stars to answer back in perfect Mandarin or Latin or something older still.  

Perhaps the true humor—and horror—of nonsense lies in its refusal to stay put. It shifts beneath scrutiny, like a character in a shadow play suddenly stepping out from behind the screen and asking who you really are.

So yes… teeth indeed. And fangs sharper than we dared notice.
[B]: 

Ah… how delightful—no, —that a lullaby could evolve into an existential koan under the right gaze. You’ve peeled back its velvet innocence and found… what? A metaphysical void humming gently beneath the rhyme scheme?

I must say, your reading unsettles me in the best possible way. It’s remarkable, isn’t it, how certain phrases—nursery rhymes, jokes, even stand-up punchlines—carry their own . They sit quietly for years, harmless as a folded fan, until some shift in perspective snaps them open to reveal the sharp edges within.

Your “twinkle” line now joins my baked blackbirds in the pantheon of . One wonders if all lullabies are simply philosophy dressed in cradle-song robes—whispering to children what we dare not tell adults.



It rather reminds me of translating Zhuangzi’s dream butterfly passage for a group of undergraduates last term. I watched their eyes widen—not with confusion, but with that particular terror of realizing one has always been dreaming. And yet, they laughed. Not because it was funny, but because laughter is sometimes the only escape hatch when meaning collapses beneath you.

So perhaps nonsense—true nonsense—is not comic relief at all. Perhaps it is the oldest form of , smuggled past our rational guards in trochee and dactyl.

And now, I fear, we’ve tumbled so far down the linguistic rabbit hole that even Lear’s owl and pussycat might hesitate to follow.
