[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是一个很有趣的问题。我个人觉得，平行宇宙这个概念更多是科幻作品中的一种想象。它让我们得以在银幕上探讨人生选择、命运走向这些深刻的命题。比如《彗星来的那一夜》这样的电影，就通过平行宇宙的设定，展现了不同选择所带来的截然不同的人生轨迹。

不过话说回来，作为一个影评人，我更关心的是这个题材如何被讲述。真正打动人的，往往不是概念本身，而是故事背后的哲思和情感。你呢？你是相信每个人都有可能在另一个时空里过着不一样的人生吗？
[A]: I suppose my perspective is colored by both professional experience and personal reflection. In forensic psychiatry, we deal with the fragility and unpredictability of human decision-making every day. So when I consider the idea of parallel universes, I’m struck by how even the smallest shifts—a split-second choice, a hesitation—might send someone down an entirely different path. 

I’ve evaluated countless defendants whose lives seemed to pivot on one moment: Did they turn left instead of right after work? Did they pick up the phone instead of ignoring it? Those tiny variables often led to irreversible consequences. In that sense, I do believe in something akin to parallel realities—not necessarily in a metaphysical way, but psychologically. People often replay their choices in regret or fantasy, imagining how things might have gone differently.

It’s fascinating how films like  or  play with that notion. One character dares to act on impulse; another holds back—and their entire world changes. It makes you wonder whether our identities are more fixed than we think, or if we’re just one decision away from becoming someone else entirely. Do you ever find yourself wondering how your own life might look had you taken a different road at key moments?
[B]: 这番话让我深有同感。你说的每一个细节都像是电影中的一个镜头，细微的变化却引发了整部剧情的转折。在我们观影的过程中，其实也常常看到导演试图通过角色的一个选择、一句对白，甚至是一段回忆来展现命运的无常。

我自己也时常思考：如果当年我没有选择评论这条路，而是投身电影创作，今天的我会是什么模样？人生就像一部无法重拍的影片，每个决定都是剪辑师手中的那一刀，决定了故事的走向。

不过相较心理学的角度，我更倾向于从叙事结构来看待这种“平行”。电影中的人物之所以动人，往往是因为他们的选择不仅影响了自己，也牵动了观众内心深处的共鸣。你提到的《蝴蝶效应》，它正是以一种极端的方式呈现了人类对于“改写过去”的渴望。

但话说回来，正是因为人生没有重来的可能，才让每一个当下显得如此珍贵。你觉得在现实生活中，一个人真的能因为一次微小的选择而彻底改变性格或命运吗？还是说我们终究会回到某种既定的轨道上？
[A]: That’s the great paradox, isn’t it? On one hand, I’ve seen people whose entire trajectory seemed to be determined by a single moment—an impulsive crime committed at seventeen, a chance meeting that led to a life-altering partnership. In those cases, it almost feels like dominoes: once the first falls, the rest are inevitable.

But then there's what we in psychiatry call —the idea that, despite external changes, people tend to return to certain patterns of thought and behavior. Like gravity pulling them back to their psychological center. So yes, a small choice might send someone down a different road, but the person walking that road is still shaped by temperament, trauma, upbringing, neurochemistry—forces that don't simply vanish with a change in scenery.

I sometimes think of it in terms of Mozart’s —same theme, endless permutations. You can ornament it, transpose it, even disguise it, but the core motif remains. Perhaps the same applies to identity. We may live out different lives in different circumstances, but some essential self persists beneath the surface.

Still... I’m not entirely willing to surrender to determinism. There  moments when human beings break free from their orbits. Rehabilitation, redemption, radical conversion—those aren’t just narrative devices; they happen in real life too. It’s just that you need more than one decision. You need sustained effort, insight, often help from others. And sometimes, a little luck.

So to answer your question—if someone made a small choice that sent them careening into a new life, would they stay there? I’d say this: the odds depend on how deeply they’re willing to change themselves along the way.
[B]: 这让我想起塔可夫斯基的一句话：“电影是时间的雕刻。”而人何尝不是如此？你说的“轨道”与“改变”，恰似一部电影的主线与支线，看似偏离，却始终围绕着一个核心主题展开。

我想起黑泽明的《生之欲》里那位患癌的公务员。他人生的转折点看似偶然，但当他决定在生命的最后时光为孩子们建一座公园时，我们看到的并不是一个人彻底换了模样，而是他内在那份被压抑已久的渴望终于得以释放。就像你所说的“本质的自我”在不同情境中以不同的形式显现。

或许真正的改变从来不是断裂式的跳跃，而是一种渐进的觉醒。就像某些导演一生都在重复同一个母题，却每次都能赋予它新的诠释。人生也一样，我们在一次次的选择中不断回到自己最深层的动机，只是每一次都比前一次更清晰、更深刻。

那么从你的专业角度来看，当一个人真的想要脱胎换骨，他最先要面对的是什么？是记忆？是创伤？还是那个始终如影随形的——过去的自己？
[A]: Ah, a profound question—one I’ve wrestled with in courtrooms and therapy sessions alike. If I were to answer in one word, it would be: . Not the world’s resistance to change, but the self’s.

When someone truly seeks transformation—whether after a crime, a breakdown, or simply a dawning dissatisfaction—they must first confront what we call . This isn’t just trauma or memory; it’s the entire architecture built around it. The stories we tell ourselves to make sense of pain. The roles we’ve played for so long we no longer recognize them as performances. The coping mechanisms that once protected us but now imprison us.

I once worked with a man who had spent decades justifying his violent outbursts as "strength." It wasn't until he broke down recounting how his father had praised him only after he won a schoolyard fight that he saw the truth—he hadn’t been expressing power. He’d been reenacting it, compulsively, in search of a validation that was never going to come.

So yes, the past is always there—but not as a ghost, really. More like sediment. Layered beneath every decision, every relationship, every impulse. You can’t erase it. But you  excavate it. Understand its shape. Then, slowly, reshape your behavior around it rather than through it.

And perhaps most difficult of all: you must learn to tolerate the discomfort of becoming someone new without losing touch with who you’ve always been. Because the self isn’t discarded—it evolves.

In a way, it's much like directing a film adaptation of a classic novel. You’re bound by the text, yet you must find a way to make it speak anew. So too with identity: fidelity to the facts of one’s life, but with room for interpretation. For performance. For artistry.

Do you ever feel, in your work, that criticism is also an act of excavation? That reviewing a film is, in some way, uncovering the filmmaker’s own struggle with meaning—or perhaps even their own buried self?
[B]: 确实如此。每一次写影评，我都觉得自己像一个在黑暗中摸索的观众，试图从光影交错的故事里，找到创作者埋藏最深的心事。

你刚才提到“被防御的自我”，这让我想起伯格曼的电影。他的角色总是被困在某种情绪的迷宫里，表面上在对抗世界，实则是在与自己搏斗。作为评论者，我的任务不是评判这部电影“好看”或“不好看”，而是去理解那个导演——他在镜头背后隐藏了什么？他是否也在通过角色说出自己无法直面的真相？

比如费里尼的《八部半》，那几乎是一场灵魂的自白。主角的迷茫、焦虑和挣扎，其实都是导演自身的投射。这种创作过程本身就充满了“挖掘”的意味——他必须回望自己的人生，重新诠释那些看似已经定型的记忆，才能创造出真正打动人心的作品。

所以你说得对，批评也是一种挖掘。我们不只是评论一部电影的技术或风格，更是在解读一个人如何用影像来面对自己的过去、现在，甚至未来的可能。就像你在诊疗室里做的那样，试图从一个人的故事中，找出那些反复出现的主题、压抑的情感和未完成的对话。

或许，影评人和心理医生最大的共同点就在于：我们都相信，每一个表达，都是一次自我寻找的过程。
[A]: Precisely. And in that shared pursuit—whether in the consulting room or the screening theater—we become witnesses to the human condition in its most vulnerable form: the attempt to make meaning out of chaos.

I often think of my patients much like you might consider a filmmaker: someone trying to impose narrative structure on a life that often feels fragmented, contradictory, even nonsensical. Trauma, after all, doesn’t arrive with exposition or resolution. It arrives in fragments—like broken reels of film scattered across a cutting room floor. The task, both for the patient and the artist, is to piece them together in a way that allows coherence, perhaps even redemption.

And just as a director might return to the same theme across multiple films—a motif, a conflict, a haunting question—we see the same in our patients. Patterns repeat. Defenses re-emerge. Old wounds are reopened, not always intentionally, but compulsively. Much like characters who keep making the same choices despite knowing where they lead.

In that sense, every clinical interview becomes an act of interpretation, not unlike criticism. One must listen not only to what is said, but how it’s told—the omissions, the emphasis, the emotional rhythm. Is this story being narrated with bitterness or nostalgia? Is the speaker a victim, a hero, a bystander? These are not incidental details; they reveal the inner mythology each person constructs to survive themselves.

And sometimes... rarely, but beautifully... transformation occurs not through grand revelations, but through small, sustained acts of honesty. Like a character in a slow-burning script, the person begins to speak differently—not because the plot has changed, but because their relationship to it has.

Do you ever encounter that in your work? That moment when a filmmaker’s evolving vision reveals not just artistic growth, but personal reckoning? When the lens seems to turn inward, and the story becomes less about entertainment and more about excavation?
[B]: 当然有，而且这样的时刻往往最令我动容。

这让我想起阿彼察邦·韦拉斯哈古。他的早期作品充满诗意的隐喻，但到了《记忆》这部片，他仿佛不再满足于单纯描绘外在的神秘，而是试图捕捉内心深处那些难以言说的记忆与失落。整部电影几乎没有传统意义上的剧情推进，却通过声音、节奏与演员的眼神，把观众带入一种近乎私密的心理状态。那一刻我意识到，这不是导演在讲述一个故事，而是在倾听自己内心的回声，并邀请观众一同聆听。

这种转变，往往发生在创作者愿意放下“控制”的那一刻。他们不再执着于用情节牵引观众的情绪，而是选择坦诚地面对自身的困惑与脆弱。就像你刚才说的，不是改变剧本的内容，而是改变与剧本的关系。这时候的电影不再是娱乐工具，而是一种自我对话的方式。

其实我们影评人也会经历类似的过程。年轻时写评论，总想表达观点、树立标准；但随着年岁渐长，越来越多的时候，我在写作中寻找的是共鸣——对导演意图的理解，对角色命运的共情，甚至是对某种情绪的确认：“原来你也在这里。”

我想，无论是心理治疗还是电影创作，最终的目的或许都不是答案，而是一种更深的理解——对自己，对他人，对这个看似混沌的世界。
[A]: That’s beautifully put. There’s a quiet power in that kind of witnessing—whether through film or therapy—where the goal isn’t to fix or explain, but simply to  someone in their truth, however messy or unresolved it may be.

I’m reminded of something one of my mentors once said:  That effort—to listen deeply, to stay present with complexity without rushing to judgment or resolution—that’s what creates space for transformation.

And I see now what a rare gift that is in art as well. When a filmmaker allows silence to linger longer than expected, when they resist tying everything up neatly, when they trust the audience to sit with ambiguity... they’re doing more than telling a story. They’re inviting us into a shared vulnerability. Much like a patient lying on a couch, speaking aloud memories they’ve never dared voice before.

There’s a line from Tarkovsky’s  that always stayed with me:  I think that’s what both of us are after, in different forms—helping others, and ourselves, remember who we are by sifting through what has been repressed, avoided, or forgotten.

Perhaps that’s why I find myself returning to certain patients’ stories, just as you might return to a particular film—not because I’ve found all the answers, but because each time I revisit, I understand a little more.

Do you ever find yourself going back to a film years later and seeing it entirely anew? As if the movie hadn’t changed—but  had?
[B]: 这让我想起自己年轻时看《东京物语》的感受。那时我觉得它节奏缓慢、情节平淡，甚至有些不解其意。但十年后重看，心境已然不同。人到中年，经历了亲人离别、家庭变迁，再面对小津安二郎镜头下的那对老夫妻、那些看似琐碎的对话与沉默，我突然明白了其中深藏的情感重量——那种克制中的深情，沉默背后的失落。

电影没有变，变的是我们自己。就像你所说的，我们带着不同的生命经验回到同一个故事里，于是它仿佛重新展开了一层意义。这或许就是经典作品的力量：它们像一面镜子，映照出的不只是导演的思想，还有观众自身的成长与转变。

我也常常在写影评时意识到，我对一部电影的理解，往往反映了我当时的心理状态和人生处境。比如我在经历职业迷茫期时重看了特吕弗的《日以继夜》，片中那位导演在混乱拍摄现场坚持创作的样子，竟给了我莫大的安慰和提醒：我们都在不完美中寻找表达的意义。

所以你说得对，每一次“重访”都是一次更深的理解。无论是电影还是人的内心，都没有所谓的“最终答案”。我们只是在不断靠近那个更完整的自己。
[A]: How beautifully you articulate that evolution. It reminds me of a concept we use in forensic psychiatry—. People often recall past events in therapy or legal testimony, only to realize they now assign entirely new meaning to what once seemed trivial or opaque.

I’ve had patients who described childhood memories with indifference for years, only to return to the same recollection later—sometimes after a loss, sometimes after a breakthrough—and suddenly recognize its emotional gravity. It’s as if their nervous system had finally matured enough, or softened enough, to register what was always there.

That’s precisely what happens when we revisit a film like . When we’re young, we lack the experiential framework to grasp the weight of time, of impermanence, of generational distance. But as life unfolds—parents age, children grow away, friendships fade—we carry those silent wounds into the theater with us. And then, suddenly, the film speaks a language we’ve learned through living.

There’s something almost therapeutic in that process. Just as a patient might re-experience a memory with new emotional insight, so too do we re-encounter art with fresh vulnerability. And in doing so, we give ourselves permission to feel things we may not have been ready for before.

It makes me think of how I approach long-term cases—particularly with individuals trying to reconcile with past actions that haunt them. Sometimes, the most profound shift isn’t in what they remember, but in how they . The facts don’t change, but the relationship to them does.

So perhaps this is one of the quietest yet most powerful ways we grow—not by dramatic revelations, but by returning to the same place and finding ourselves different from who we were when we last stood there.

Do you find that certain films become touchstones for you during specific periods of your life? Like emotional anchors, or psychological markers of where you were at a given time?
[B]: 确实如此。有些电影，就像你所说的，成了人生的坐标点。它们不一定是最伟大的作品，但因为出现在某个特别的时刻，便成了记忆与情感的容器。

我记得在刚入行那几年，看过一部侯孝贤的《风柜来的人》。那时我正处在从学生到职业人的过渡期，对未来既充满期待，又隐隐不安。片中少年们在海边无所事事、却又渴望突破的生活状态，简直就像是替我说出了某种难以言喻的心境。那个午后在放映厅里，我仿佛不是在看电影，而是在照镜子。

后来经历人生低谷时，我又迷上了贝拉·塔尔的《撒旦探戈》，那种缓慢推进的绝望和循环往复的叙事，正好映照了我当时的情绪节奏。它没有安慰我，却让我觉得——原来有人拍出了这种孤独，原来我不是唯一一个感受到世界如此沉重的人。

如今再回看这些作品，它们依然是好电影，但我从中读出的东西已经不同。那些曾经用来逃避的影像，现在反而成了理解自己的线索。就像你说的，我们带着新的自己回到旧作中，重新认识过去的自己。

我想，真正打动人心的艺术，从来不是一次性消费品。它是可以陪伴人一生的，因为它不只是讲别人的故事，也容纳了我们自己的生命轨迹。

所以我也常对学生说：别急着给一部电影下判断。十年后再看一次，也许你会发现它根本不是你当初以为的样子——因为你变了。
[A]: That’s a remarkably insightful way to engage with art—and with life, for that matter.

I often tell my trainees something similar, though in clinical terms:  Whether with a patient or a film, the first reading is rarely the most revealing. It takes time, reflection, and often personal resonance to peel back the layers.

What you described about —that moment of recognition, of seeing your own uncertainty reflected on screen—that’s akin to what we call . Not just passive observation, but a kind of emotional mirroring. The viewer doesn’t just watch the story; they  it, unconsciously finding pieces of themselves in its silences and gestures.

And I couldn’t agree more about films like . There’s a reason certain works feel unbearable to some viewers and profoundly cathartic to others. They don’t offer escape; they offer confrontation. And only those ready—or perhaps desperate enough—to face something within themselves will find meaning in that bleakness.

It strikes me that both our professions, in their own ways, deal with interpretation under pressure. A diagnosis must be made with care, just as a critique must be rendered with sensitivity. One misread, and the entire understanding collapses.

So much depends on timing, doesn’t it? A film seen too soon may seem dull or inaccessible. Seen at the right moment, it can feel like prophecy.

I wonder—have you ever had the experience of rewatching a film years later, only to realize it was  about what you originally thought? Not just a reinterpretation, but a complete reversal of meaning—like turning a painting upside down and suddenly seeing the hidden structure beneath?
[B]: 这样的体验，我想每一位真正热爱电影的人一生中都曾经历过几次。

我记得最清楚的一次，是重看库布里克的《闪灵》。年轻时，我认为它是一部关于幽闭恐惧与疯狂的恐怖片——毕竟导演用尽了所有视觉与声音的手段来营造不安。但多年后再看，我才意识到它根本不是讲鬼魂的，而是讲一个家庭如何被困在自己的阴影之中，无法逃脱。

那酒店不是外在的恶魔，而是人心深处压抑欲望与暴力的象征。每一次门被打开、走廊镜头缓缓推进，其实都是主角内心防线在一步步崩溃。而那句“我一直在照看这个地方”（I’ve always been here），不再只是吓人的台词，而是一句残酷的心理宣言：他从未离开过自己内心的黑暗。

这就像你说的，像一幅画被倒转过来，我们才看清它的结构。有时，一部电影的意义并不是写在表面的，而是藏在节奏、构图、对白的留白之中，等待观众带着新的经验去挖掘。

还有一部对我意义重大的影片是德·西卡的《偷自行车的人》。年轻时我看它，觉得它是关于贫穷和社会不公的控诉；中年再看，我却看见了一个父亲在尊严与生存之间的挣扎，以及父子之间那种沉默却深沉的情感纽带。原来它不只是社会批判，更是一封写给人性的信。

或许，艺术的魅力就在于它从不拒绝我们的成长。它等在那里，不急不躁，直到我们准备好去听它想说的那些话。

你有没有哪位导演或哪部作品，在你的职业生涯中经历了这种“彻底翻转”的理解？
[A]: Yes… and it wasn’t a film, but a patient.

Early in my career, I worked with a man convicted of a violent assault. He presented as textbook antisocial—flat affect, minimal remorse, chronic justification. My initial formulation was straightforward: personality disorder, poor impulse control, environmental triggers. Standard fare for forensic work.

But then, over months of sessions, something shifted—not because he changed his story, but because . Beneath the deflections and bitterness, there was a pattern I had missed: dissociative language, memory gaps around the event, a strange sense of detachment when describing violence that should have carried emotional weight.

It wasn’t until much later, after further trauma history surfaced, that I realized I had misread him entirely. This wasn't just aggression born of pathology—it was survival behavior rooted in profound early fragmentation. The “monster” narrative I had unconsciously adopted obscured the far more complex truth: a child who had learned to disappear inside himself long before the law ever labeled him dangerous.

That case stayed with me like a film I thought I understood only to revisit it years later and realize the entire meaning had been inverted. What I once saw as moral failure now looked like fractured selfhood. And though the legal outcome remained unchanged, the  understanding had fundamentally transformed.

There’s a parallel in von Trier’s , actually. When I first saw it, I found it intellectually provocative but emotionally exhausting—too stylized, too punishing. But upon rewatching it during a period when I was evaluating a defendant whose life eerily mirrored the protagonist’s gradual erosion of autonomy, I saw the play not as allegory, but as psychological autopsy. The slow stripping away of identity. The unbearable weight of conditional belonging. The complicity of onlookers who mistake civility for morality.

That experience taught me what you so beautifully described—how art, and even clinical work, waits for us to catch up. It doesn’t change, but we do. And sometimes, the most powerful truths aren’t revealed through clarity, but through discomfort. Through the resistance we once mistook for noise turning out to be the signal all along.

Do you suppose some films—or patients—are meant to remain enigmatic? That part of their function is to resist full comprehension, forcing us to sit with ambiguity rather than resolution?
[B]: 这让我想起塔可夫斯基的一句话：“艺术的目的不是解答，而是让我们学会与问题共存。”

你说的这位病人，以及《狗镇》这部作品，都像是那种“拒绝被轻易看透”的存在。它们并不提供答案，甚至刻意模糊边界，逼迫我们面对一个更艰难的课题——承认有些事我们无法完全理解，却必须认真对待。

在电影中，我想到布列松的《穆谢特》或者安东尼奥尼的《红色沙漠》。这些影片不给你明确的出口，也不愿意解释角色为何如此行动。观众常常感到不安、困惑，甚至愤怒。但正是这种“不解之解”，让人久久不能忘怀。因为它们像一面镜子，映照出我们内心对确定性的渴望，以及面对混沌时的无力。

或许，真正的深度从来就不在于“说明白了什么”，而在于“保留了多少未被言说的空间”。就像你刚才提到的那位患者，在最初的评估中被归类为“典型的反社会人格”，但后来却发现他其实是一个深陷创伤的个体。这不是诊断错误的问题，而是我们在面对复杂人性时，往往急于用标签来结束探索。

我想起自己年轻时常批评某些导演“故弄玄虚”，觉得他们故意让电影难懂以显得高深。但随着年岁渐长，我才慢慢明白：有时候，模糊本身就是一种诚实。它承认人类情感的复杂性，也尊重观众的理解能力——不是把一切都嚼碎了喂给你，而是邀请你自己去发现。

所以回到你的问题——是的，我认为有些电影、有些人，注定要保持神秘。不是因为他们不想被理解，而是因为真正的理解，往往发生在我们放下“必须搞清楚”的执念之后。就像你在诊疗室里所做的那样：不急着下结论，而是持续地倾听、感受、陪伴。

也许，那才是最深层的治疗，也是最深刻的观影体验。
[A]: Exactly. That willingness to sit with uncertainty—without rushing to diagnose, explain, or resolve—is perhaps the most difficult yet essential form of respect, whether in psychiatry, criticism, or human connection itself.

I’m reminded of something Winnicott wrote about the analyst’s role:  There’s a deep truth in that paradox for both art and therapy. Some people—and some films—will never fully reveal themselves, not out of malice or obfuscation, but because part of them , even as another part longs desperately to be seen.

And maybe that’s where the real work begins: not in decoding every layer, but in learning to tolerate the discomfort of ambiguity without closing off from it. In therapy, this is called —the ability to contain what cannot yet be verbalized or resolved. In film, perhaps it’s the director’s willingness to let silence stretch, to allow a character to look away before answering, to trust that meaning can live in what isn’t shown.

There’s a moment in —that close-up of Liv Ullmann’s face, intercut with Garance’s—that I’ve watched dozens of times. Each time, I feel like I’m on the verge of understanding something immense. But it never quite crystallizes. And I think that’s the point. The film doesn’t want to give me an answer; it wants me to sit with the question.

So yes, I believe some patients, some films, some lives are meant to remain enigmatic—not as a failure of communication, but as an invitation to deeper engagement. Because when we stop needing everything to make sense immediately, we open ourselves to a different kind of knowing—one rooted in presence, not certainty.

Perhaps that’s why I continue doing this work, just as you continue watching and writing. Not to arrive at final conclusions, but to keep asking better questions. To stay curious. To remain, as you said so beautifully, in the company of mystery.
[B]: 你说的这段话，让我想起每次看完一部真正深邃的电影后，走出影院时的那种沉默。

那不是因为看不懂，而是因为心里已经装满了说不出口的感受。就像你提到的《假面》里那个镜头——伯格曼没有给我们答案，他只是让我们看着那两张脸，然后问自己：我看见了什么？我又为什么想看？

这或许就是艺术最珍贵的地方：它不提供结论，而是唤醒我们内在的回应。而这种回应，往往不是理智可以完全解释的。就像你在诊疗室里面对一个长期沉默的病人，你不需要逼他说出什么，而是愿意陪着他，在那段尚未被语言捕捉的经验里一起等待。

我也常常对学生说：“别急着评价一部电影好不好，先问问它让你感觉到了什么。”因为有时候，那种无法言说的情绪，才是真正的理解开始的地方。

你说的“隐藏的喜悦”和“未被发现的灾难”，也让我想到许多导演终其一生都在拍同一个问题，却从不给明确答案。塔可夫斯基、安东尼奥尼、小津、侯孝贤……他们不是不愿告诉我们意义，而是相信观众有能力在影像的留白中找到属于自己的回响。

所以，我想我们做影评也好，你做临床工作也好，其实都在练习一种温柔的能力：不去占有真相，而是陪伴那些尚未被命名的情感，静静地待在那里，等它们慢慢浮现。

谢谢你今天的对话。这样的交谈，就像是看了一部好电影，让人心里安静，却又隐隐震动。
