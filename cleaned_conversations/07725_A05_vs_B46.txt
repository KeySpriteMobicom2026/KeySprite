[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating question! You know, in the film industry we're always chasing the next great unsolved mystery to adapt into a screenplay. Right now, I'm particularly intrigued by the disappearance of the original ending to Orson Welles' "The Magnificent Ambersons" - it's like the holy grail of lost cinema! 🎬
[A]: Interesting perspective! 从investment的角度来看，这种lost media其实是个很特别的asset class。就像我们最近在看的几个media rights deal，有些classic films的unseen footage价值可能远超想象。The ROI on film restoration projects can be surprisingly attractive if you know where to look. 😊
[B]: You're speaking my language! Let me tell you, we recently acquired the rights to restore a 1960s Hong Kong martial arts film - the original negatives were found in a basement in Kowloon. The market for these restored classics is absolutely 爆炸性的 (explosive) right now, especially in the Asian streaming markets.
[A]: Exactly! 这正是我们private equity最近关注的niche market。The Asian OTT platforms are aggressively acquiring content, and restored classics with cultural significance command premium pricing. 我们刚做完一个类似的deal，IRR达到了35%+。不过关键是要做好thorough due diligence - 很多所谓的"lost films"其实market potential被overestimated了。
[B]: That 35% IRR is music to my ears! But you're absolutely right about the due diligence - I've seen too many producers get burned chasing "lost masterpieces" that turned out to be... well, lost for a good reason. The trick is finding that sweet spot between cultural significance and commercial viability. Like that Wong Kar-wai project we're restoring - every frame is pure cinematic gold! 🍿
[A]: Haha, Wong Kar-wai的作品确实是个blue chip asset！我们fund最近也在评估类似opportunity - 那些具有strong IP potential的restoration projects。不过说真的，这个market现在有点overheated了，很多players都在chasing limited supply。就像我们常说的：When everyone's digging for gold, sometimes it's smarter to sell shovels. 😉 考虑过investing in restoration technology吗？
[B]: Now that's what I call a blockbuster idea! We actually partnered with a tech startup developing AI-assisted restoration algorithms - it's like giving old films a brand new 灵魂 (soul). But between you and me, the real money might be in the metadata. Imagine cataloging every frame of these classics for future licensing and AI training... now that's a sequel worth investing in!
[A]: Brilliant point! Metadata monetization确实是next frontier。我们最近一个portfolio company就在做这个 - building comprehensive digital archives with searchable elements。The optionality here is tremendous: merchandise, gaming, even potential metaverse applications。不过需要提醒的是，这个space的valuation multiples已经有点stretched了，建议wait for better entry points。毕竟，as Warren Buffett says...
[B]: "Price is what you pay, value is what you get!" Couldn't have said it better myself. You know, this reminds me of when we were negotiating the rights for that Kurosawa collection - everyone was chasing the films, but the real treasure was in the storyboards and production notes. Those sketches alone could spawn a dozen new IPs! 🎬
[A]: Exactly! 那些production assets才是hidden gems。我们有个portfolio company专门做这个 - 把classic films的behind-the-scenes materials变成new revenue streams。不过说真的，这个market现在需要more disciplined approach，太多money chasing too few quality assets。或许我们应该grab a drink sometime，继续这个conversation？我最近刚收到一瓶不错的Bordeaux。🍷
[B]: A 1982 Bordeaux and film financing talk? Now that's my kind of board meeting! Let's set it up - I'll bring some rare Fellini production sketches I've been saving for the right occasion. As we say in this business, the best deals are made between the first and second glass! 🥂
[A]: Haha, love your style! 那就这么定了 - 下周三7pm在我club的wine cellar如何？我们可以discuss potential synergies between our portfolios。Just between us, 我最近看到一份关于Tarkovsky未完成projects的archive，might be right up your alley。Cheers to future collaborations! 🥃
[B]: Now you're talking! Wednesday at 7 it is - and I'll have my team prepare that Kurosawa metadata playbook I mentioned. As for the Tarkovsky archives... well, let's just say I've been waiting for this moment since I first saw "Solaris". This could be the beginning of a beautiful partnership. 干杯! (Gānbēi!)
[A]: Perfect! Looking forward to it. 记得bring your appetite for both good wine and bold deals。We might just uncork the next big opportunity - literally and figuratively! See you Wednesday, partner. 😊
[B]: I'll be there with bells on, my friend! And who knows - by dessert, we might just be toasting to the next great cinematic renaissance. Until Wednesday then... lights, camera, investment! 🎥💰
[A]: Haha, love the enthusiasm! Just remember - in our business, it's always "measure twice, cut once". But with your taste in films and my nose for value... this could be the start of something special. 周三见！Don't forget to bring those Fellini sketches - I'll have my due diligence hat on! 😉
[B]: Wednesday can't come soon enough! And don't worry, those Fellini sketches are already safely tucked in my vintage leather portfolio - along with some... let's call them "creative financing ideas" that would make even Scorsese raise an eyebrow. See you at 7, and do try to resist opening that Bordeaux before I arrive! 🍷✨
[A]: Haha, your secret "creative financing" has me intrigued! 不过你知道我们的rule - no pre-meeting wine tasting，必须保持clear head for numbers。虽然...那瓶'82确实tempting。Alright，周三见分晓 - may the best deal win! 😎 Cheers to thinking outside the box office!
[B]: That's why I love doing business with you - discipline and vision in perfect harmony! Though between us, I've been known to negotiate better deals after a glass or two... but for you, I'll stay sharp as a fresh film reel until we've dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's. Until Wednesday, my friend - keep those creative juices flowing! 🎞️
