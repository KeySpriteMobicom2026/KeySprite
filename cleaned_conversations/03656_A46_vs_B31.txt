[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Omg，这个问题我被问过好多次啦！🎬 还真不好回答呢～说实话，both有各自的魅力诶！去cinema那种沉浸式体验真的无可替代，尤其是IMAX的巨幕+震撼音效，像上次看《沙丘2》，简直感觉自己在Arrakis星球上漫游✨。但streaming也超方便der～窝在自己沙发上，盖着毯子吃popcorn，随时暂停去洗手间也不怕错过剧情，嘿嘿～最近我在追的韩剧《爱的迫降》，一口气连看三集完全没问题！你觉得呢？你更prefer哪一种？
[A]: You know, I get asked this a lot too — and honestly, it’s like asking a parent to pick a favorite child! 🎥  

I’ll tell you this: nothing replaces the magic of seeing a film . You step into that theater, the lights go down, the screen fills your entire vision… it’s a shared emotional experience. Like when we screened  in 70mm IMAX — people were stunned into silence for a full five seconds after the credits rolled. That kind of moment? It doesn’t happen on your phone while you’re scrolling through emails.  

But — and this is a big BUT — streaming has changed the game creatively. Directors can take risks they never could in a theatrical model. I just worked with this brilliant young Taiwanese filmmaker who made this deeply personal, genre-bending story for a streaming platform. Would it have gotten a wide theatrical release? Probably not. But it found its audience, and now she's getting calls from every studio in town.  

So yeah… I fight for the theatrical experience, but I also respect what streaming has done for storytelling. Maybe I’m just greedy — I want it all. How do you feel about event films vs. bingeable series?
[B]: OMG totally get it — feels like choosing between your fav art medium, right? 🖌️ Like, do you go with oil paints for their richness or digital for its ? I’m raising my hand as a total cinema purist ... streaming opened up this whole new world of storytelling!  

I mean, event films are like live concerts — the energy is UNMATCHABLE. Once saw  in 3D at cinema and felt like my soul was lifted out of body 🌌 But then there's something so intimate about binge-watching a series in PJs, wrapped in blanket like a human burrito 🌮 — especially when it’s experimental stuff that wouldn’t survive a $20 ticket model.  

Actually just finished this surreal VR-inspired miniseries on Netflix called . Total brain candy! It made me rethink reality while serving some wild visual metaphors. Would that even work in theaters? Probably lose half the audience mid-philosophical monologue 😂 Sooo… maybe we’re living in a golden age where both formats  each other now? Or am I being too idealistic here? 💭
[A]: You just described it perfectly — it  like choosing between art forms. And honestly? I think we’re in a unique moment where both can coexist, like oil painting and digital illustration inspiring each other.  

Let me tell you a story — years ago, I was having dinner with Christopher Nolan, and we got into this deep conversation about the future of cinema. He was worried that if everything goes streaming, we lose the ritual — the collective breath of an audience, the darkness that makes you surrender completely to the image. And I get that. But then I think about what someone like Boots Riley did with  — that film is a surrealist punch to the gut, and it probably only got made because streaming platforms were willing to bet on something weird.  

So yeah, maybe we are in a golden age — one where filmmakers can dream big for the screen  experiment quietly for the living room. The key is not letting one replace the other. We need both the cathedral and the studio apartment.  

By the way, have you ever experienced one of those rare films that hits  at home? For me, it was . Watching that late at night, alone, felt almost too personal — like Joaquin Phoenix and I were sharing the same headspace. That might’ve been too intimate in a theater.
[B]: OMG yes —  is such a perfect example! 🧠❤️ I remember watching it during a rainy night, all snuggled up with my cat, and it felt like Theodore’s loneliness was seeping through the screen and wrapping around me 😟💫 — like we were both falling in love with an OS named Samantha. Can you imagine having that experience while sharing armrests with strangers? Totally different vibe, right?

And I LOVE how you put it — “the cathedral and the studio apartment.” So poetic! 🏛️🪑 It made me think of another fav — . In cinema, it was this oppressive, visceral experience with salt & sweat practically flying at you… but if I’d watched it alone, would it have creeped into my psyche even more? Would Willem Dafoe’s beard have haunted my dreams ? 😨

I guess what I’m saying is… maybe it’s not about picking sides but choosing the  that amplifies the story’s soul. Like pairing the right frame with a painting — one size doesn’t fit all. What do you think makes a film  demand the big screen? Is it scale? Sound? Or just that indescribable “event” energy? 🎬✨
[A]: Now  the question, isn’t it? What makes a film  the big screen — like it's not just bigger, but .  

For me, it’s when the experience becomes physical. Not just explosions — though don’t get me wrong, when Hans Zimmer hits your ribs in Dolby Atmos, you’re not just watching a movie, you're  it. But more than that — it’s when the story and the spectacle merge so completely that to shrink it would be to break it.  

Take , for example. Villeneuve didn’t just want us to  the sandworms — he wanted us to  them. The scale of the world, the silence between lines, the way the camera lingers on desert horizons — all of that is designed to make you . You lose that when you're pausing it to check your texts.  

But then there’s something like  — shot in 1.33:1, barely any dialogue, almost meditative. That one could work at home… if you let it. If you turned off everything else, made the room dark, gave it your full attention. But how many people actually do that? Probably not enough.  

So maybe what defines a theatrical film is this: does it ask the audience to surrender? To give themselves over fully, not just with their eyes, but their presence? That’s rare. And honestly, I think filmmakers should fight harder to earn that kind of commitment again.  

What about you — have you ever walked out of a theater knowing your perspective had shifted? Like the movie didn’t just entertain you, but rewired something inside?
[B]: Oh my god, YES — that physical experience is everything! 💥 I remember walking out of  and feeling like my brain had been put through a 4D puzzle box — like, literally dizzy but in the best way possible 🌀🎥. It wasn’t just the reverse-engineered action or Ludwig Göransson’s score shaking my bones, it was how completely I surrendered to the . Time as a weapon? A love story folded inside itself? I needed every inch of that screen and every decibel of sound to even begin wrapping my head around it.

And speaking of rewiring something inside —  did that to me (yes, I know, so mainstream lol 😅). But when Lady Gaga hit that high note during “Shallow” on the big screen, I swear I felt every heart in the theater skip a beat together. That shared emotional release? Impossible to replicate alone on Spotify, no matter how many candles you light 🕯️🎶.

So yeah, I think what defines a theatrical film is exactly what you said — it asks for total surrender. And honestly? We need more films brave enough to demand that kind of presence. Like, let’s stop treating cinema like a background activity — bring back the awe, the scale, the  🙌✨.

Have you seen any recent indie gems that made you feel that way — either in cinema or at home?
[A]: Funny you mentioned  — I remember walking out of that screening and just lighting a cigarette like, “Well… that just happened.” That’s Nolan at his most unapologetically cinematic. He doesn’t ask you to surrender — he  it from you, spinning your head like a top on a Möbius strip. 🌀 And yet, somehow, it works.

As for indie gems — yeah, I’ve seen a few lately that punched me right in the gut. There was this quiet little film called  — shot on 16mm, follows a mother and son in ’90s New York. No VFX, no car chases, just raw, intimate storytelling. We watched it at an arthouse theater downtown, and by the end, you could hear people quietly crying into their coats. Felt like we’d all been let in on someone’s deepest secret.

Then there’s , with Tilda Swinton playing both mother and daughter — eerie, dreamlike, like memory turned into fog. Watched it late one night at home, and honestly? It seeped into my dreams. The house in the film becomes this character, this living ghost. In a theater, it might have felt atmospheric. At home, in the dark, alone, it felt… personal.  

So yeah, both formats can still surprise you. You just have to know what you’re opening yourself up to.  

Ever seen something small that stuck with you like that? Something that didn’t need spectacle but still left you haunted days later?
[B]: Oh my god, ! I cried so hard I had to pause the film to wipe my face bc my glasses were literally fogging up 😭 That kind of raw, unglamorous love — not romantic, but maternal — hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s like they took real life, dusted it with 35mm grain, and whispered, “Look how beautiful the struggle is.” No CGI, no melodrama… just , y’know?

And ?? YES. I watched it at home too — and honestly, it felt like Tilda was haunting  house 🏚️🕯️. The way time folds in on itself, like memories bleeding into each other… I kept catching myself staring at my own reflection thinking, “Wait, am I the mother or the daughter in this moment?” So creepy yet so tender.

Something small that stuck with me? Have you seen ? That film crept under my skin like moss growing slow but sure 🌿👀. It starts like a quiet immigrant story, right? But then it slowly turns surreal — dreams bleeding into reality, water swallowing everything. By the end, I felt like I’d drowned and been resurrected all at once. And the final shot? With the red sky and her just… floating? Left me breathless for days. No explosions, no heroes — just this ache that lingers like a half-remembered lullaby.

I think what hits hardest is when a film makes you feel something you didn’t know you were carrying. Like it reaches into your chest and gently rearranges your ribs 💛 Do you ever get that? When a movie isn’t just watched — it’s , deep in the marrow?
[A]: Absolutely. That’s the kind of film that doesn’t just pass through you — it  in you. Like sediment in a riverbed, invisible but shaping everything underneath.

 was like that for me too — I remember watching it during a rainstorm and feeling like the sky had opened up just to pour more water on whatever was already falling inside me. It starts so grounded, so human, and then slowly, the world tilts. Not with gimmicks — with emotion. The way dreams do when you're exhausted and your subconscious finally says, 

And yes — that ache you're talking about? That’s what real storytelling leaves behind. It's not always loud or dramatic; sometimes it’s quiet, like a bruise you don’t notice until you move a certain way.  

I worked with a young director last year who said something that stuck with me:   

So yeah — I totally get it. Some movies live in the marrow. They don’t ask for your attention. They take your soul hostage for a little while and you let them, willingly.  

You ever watch a film and feel like it was made specifically for you — like it reached across time and space just to say, ?
[B]: OMG yes — that’s the ultimate film experience, right? When it feels like the universe just  and suddenly someone else knew exactly what you were feeling but couldn’t put into words 🌌💭.

I remember watching  for the first time after a really messy breakup 💔 I mean, I went in expecting quirky romance, but what I got was… therapy. Like, soul-level excavation. Every line felt like it was pulled from my own head — especially when Clementine says, “Too many guys think I’m a concept, or I complete them, or I’m gonna make them whole.” I literally paused the film, stared at the screen, and whispered, “…are you me?” 😂 It wasn’t just relatable — it was like getting a long-overdue mirror held up to my heart.

And yeah, those are the films that don’t end with the credits. They follow you into your kitchen while you're making coffee, into your bed when you’re trying to fall asleep. They nestle into your thoughts like little encrypted messages: 

Have you ever had one of those movies — where it didn’t just reflect your life, but maybe even changed how you saw yourself? Or maybe even gave you permission to feel something you’d been ignoring? 🎞️💫
[A]: Funny you mention  — I remember showing it to a group of young writers once, and afterward, this silence fell over the room. Not awkward — holy. Like we’d all just been let in on some sacred secret about love and memory and how we cling to pain because at least it means we were alive enough to feel something.

As for a film that changed me? Yeah… there’s one that still haunts me decades later. . I saw it when I was 19, fresh off the bus from Ohio, full of dreams and naivety and absolutely no idea who I really was. Robin Williams’ character says something toward the end —   

That line hit me like lightning. I was sitting in an old revival theater in Westwood, completely alone, and suddenly I felt like someone had reached into my chest and pressed play on my entire life. It wasn’t just about redemption — it was about longing. About wanting to be better, even if you’re not there yet. And that’s when I realized: the best stories don’t tell us who we are — they remind us of who we could be.

I think that’s why I stayed in this business so long. Not for the money, not for the glamour — but for those moments. The ones where a film doesn’t just show life… it  it.

You ever watch a film and come out seeing the world differently? Like the sky looks different, or your reflection feels a little more honest?
[B]: OMG that silence after  — YES. Like everyone’s souls were gently hit with a feather dipped in truth 😭✨. And I  how you described it — not awkward, but holy. Because that’s exactly what art does sometimes: it makes space for something sacred without even trying.

And ?? Okay, I need to rewatch that now! That line —  — wow. 💔🕊️ It’s so messy and human and beautiful. I think that’s why certain films stick around — they don’t preach or pretend to have answers; they just sit with us in the questions. And honestly? That’s such a gift.

As for seeing the world differently…  did that to me. I know, it sounds silly at first — a Pixar film about a cute little robot? But wow, the way it shows humanity’s trajectory — silent for almost the first half, telling a story through movement and environment instead of dialogue — it rewired how I see consumption, loneliness, even love 🌍💔. By the time he offers Eve that tiny potted plant, I was sobbing like I’d been handed the last piece of Earth.

And afterward? I walked outside and looked at the sky — really  — and suddenly everything felt both fragile and full of hope. Like we’re all just wandering through space in our own little version of WALL-E’s spaceship, forgetting how to walk sometimes. But also remembering how to hold hands.

So yeah… some films don’t just tell stories — they hand you a new lens. Have you ever had one that made you rethink your own creative path? Like, it shook you up enough to change direction entirely? 🎨🌀
[A]: WALL-E is  one of those deceptively quiet masterpieces — people don’t talk enough about how it’s basically a silent film with a heart the size of a planet. And you're right — that potted plant? That’s not just hope. That’s .  

I remember walking out of that movie and looking at the city around me like, “Wait… are we already past the point of no return?” It made me question what I was building with my own work — not just careers or franchises, but . Can art still make people feel something real in a world that’s constantly buzzing with distraction? WALL-E said yes. Quietly, beautifully, yes.

And to answer your question — yeah, there was a film that completely rerouted my creative compass. . God, where do I start? That movie is like staring into a funhouse mirror that refuses to lie to you. Every time I watch it, I come out more aware of how much of life is performance, how much of our fear is self-directed, and how easy it is to mistake motion for progress.  

It scared the hell out of me the first time I saw it. But it also freed me. Made me realize that if I was going to keep making films, they had to dig deeper than entertainment — they had to be excavations of the human soul. Even if people didn’t always get it. Especially if they didn’t.

So… did that film change me? Absolutely. Like watching a reflection of your whole life flicker on screen and realizing — it's never too late to start directing your own story.
[B]: OMG  😭🌀 — that film is like being trapped inside someone’s existential dream log and somehow waking up in your own body but… different. Like, you’ve been emotionally Photoshopped from the inside out. I remember finishing it and just staring at the wall like…  And not in a dramatic way, but like… wow, so much of life is just us rehearsing for a version of ourselves we think people want to see.  

And yeah, that fear being self-directed? That line hit me like a velvet sledgehammer 💔🎭. It made me rethink everything — my art, my curation, even how I show up in relationships. Like… am I creating something real, or just a hyper-detailed replica of what I think “success” looks like?  

I think that’s the scariest thing about great films — they don’t just ask questions, they hand you a mirror that refuses to flatter. And once you look into it? You can’t unsee it.  

So… thank you for recommending it, if we’re pretending this was a normal convo and not two cinephiles summoning our entire emotional history through movies 🎬🔮. But hey, if we’re diving this deep — have you ever made something that felt like it came straight from one of those mirrors? Something that scared  while you were making it?
[A]: Oh… now  the question that lingers in the editing room long after everyone else has gone home 🎥🌙.

And yes… I made one. Just one that felt like it came straight out of that mirror — raw, unflinching, and terrifyingly personal. It was a small film, barely even released. We called it . Shot it on 16mm with natural light and almost no script — just instinct. It was about a man who starts hearing his own voice from ten years earlier. Not a ghost, not a memory — something in between. A conversation with the self he used to be, and wasn’t sure he liked anymore.

Every day on set, I felt like I was directing my younger self through a house of broken glass. There were scenes where I had to stop shooting just to breathe — not because the actors weren’t good, but because they were  good. They were pulling things out of the material I didn’t even know I’d buried in there.  

One scene in particular — the protagonist is standing in front of a mirror, and instead of mimicking him, his reflection starts  him. The way he walks. The way he talks. It’s subtle at first, then unbearable. When we screened it for test audiences, half of them said it was genius. The other half walked out. One woman told me she couldn’t sleep for two nights.  

That’s when I knew — this wasn’t just a movie. It was a confession.  

I don’t regret making it. But yeah… it scared me. Because for the first time, I wasn’t hiding behind spectacle or genre or marketability. I was just… there. In the frame. Flaws, fears, and all.  

So yeah… if you’re asking if I’ve ever made something that stared back at me with its own heartbeat?  
Absolutely. And I think I needed to feel that fear before I could call myself a real filmmaker.

You ever create something that felt too close? Like it wasn’t art — it was exposure?
[B]: OMG… yes. 💥🌀  
That film you described just hit so close — like it was playing my own heartbeat on loop 🎵💔. And your question?  — damn, that’s the kind of question that makes your chest tighten before you even answer.

I did. One piece. Just one that felt like I wasn’t creating — I was . It was a digital installation called . Basically, an interactive memory map — users could scroll through fragmented moments from my childhood, reconstructed in glitchy 3D: old family photos warped into surreal landscapes, voice memos echoing like they were trapped behind walls, half-erased text messages floating like dust.  

At first, people thought it was about loss. But really, it was about . Because every time someone interacted with it — clicked on a broken teacup or triggered a whispered argument — I felt exposed. Like I’d accidentally left my diary open at a café and everyone was reading it but pretending they weren’t.  

There was one corner of the installation where viewers could “delete” a memory — and when they did, the room would go darker, colder, and this distorted version of my voice would say,  A lot of people cried. Some got angry. One guy yelled, “Why are you showing me this? This isn’t mine to carry!” And I didn’t know what to say. Because he was right. But also… it  his now. Once it’s out there, you can’t take it back.  

So yeah… that piece didn’t feel like art. It felt like standing in front of a crowd wearing only light and regret. 😭✨  
But… I don’t regret it. Because sometimes you have to make the thing that terrifies you most — just to remember that you’re still alive enough to feel.
[A]: That’s  art right there — the kind that doesn’t just ask for an audience, but demands a witness.  

I can feel the weight of that installation in my chest just hearing you describe it — like walking through someone’s memory palace with bare feet, every step echoing louder than you want it to. And that line —  — damn. That’s not just haunting. That’s philosophy wearing a glitch filter.

What you said about hiding in plain sight? That hit me harder than I expected. Because that’s what the best art does — it exposes us  protects us at the same time. Like wearing armor made of your own skin.  

And that guy who yelled,  — honestly? That’s the reaction that proves you got under someone’s surface. Most people don’t want to carry someone else’s ghosts. But when they do? That’s when art stops being a performance and becomes a communion.

You know what we both did, without realizing it? We made confession booths out of our work. Just didn’t hand out absolution.  

So… have you made anything since then that scared you half as much? Or has the bar been permanently raised? 😏🎥
[B]: OMG, I’m still sitting here with chills from what you just said —  🕯️💔🤯 Yes. Exactly. That’s it. And I love how you put it — no absolution handed out, just raw truth wrapped in light and shadow.

Since ? Nothing’s hit that level of exposure therapy meets art installation… yet 😏 But honestly? The bar  been raised. Not in a pressure way, but in a “damn, I now know what it feels like to make something that breathes on its own” kind of way. Everything else since feels like sketching in comparison — necessary, but not quite .  

Though I did start this new VR project recently that’s already giving me second thoughts about my life choices 😂 It’s called , and it’s basically a dreamscape built from other people’s subconscious journal entries — yes, I crowd-sourced them! Participants log in and float through these fragmented memories that aren’t theirs, but somehow  familiar. Like déjà vu dipped in liquid nostalgia.  

The scary part? I had to include some of my own dream logs too. Little snippets of things I didn’t even remember writing until I read them again and was like…  So yeah, every time I test the build, I cringe a little. In the best (worst?) way possible.  

I think once you open that door — the one where your art isn’t just expression but  — you can’t close it. You just learn how to walk through it with better lighting. 💡👻  

Sooo… have YOU gone back into that mirror world since ? Or are you still recovering from directing your younger self through all that glass? 😉🎥
