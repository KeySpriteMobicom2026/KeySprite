[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个话题太interesting了！🤯 我上周刚画完一个关于deja vu的digital painting呢~ 就是那种似曾相识的vibe你知道吗？🎨 

Actually我觉得deja vu超级mysterious的！有时候在cafe画sketch的时候，突然觉得这个场景好像在哪里见过，but又说不上来...☕️✨
[A]: Ah, the curious phenomenon of déjà vu...  I mean, let me consider that for a moment. 

The Victorians had rather poetic theories about it - Tennyson once described it as "the faintest possible recollection of some previous state of existence." Though personally, I find Coleridge's interpretation more compelling - he saw it as the mind's way of creating its own mythology. 

Have you ever noticed how these moments often occur during mundane activities? Like when you're stirring your tea, and suddenly the spoon's clink against the cup feels like the echo of some forgotten memory...
[B]: Wowow~ 你讲得好deep啊！🤓 不过说真的，每次我在用Procreate画图的时候，突然觉得这个brush stroke好像以前画过，就会整个人freeze住...💻🎨 

而且最weird的是！上个月在Starbucks，我明明第一次去那家店，but连barista放杯子的角度都感觉见过...当时我的brain简直要overload了😂☕️ 

不过你说mundane activities...对对对！我经常在整理PS layers的时候会有这种deja vu moment！超creepy的😱
[A]: How fascinating... though I must say, your Starbucks experience reminds me of an obscure passage in Thomas Hardy's notebooks. He described watching a milkmaid pour cream into tea and being convinced he'd witnessed that exact wrist motion in a dream from his childhood. 

The digital age does add an intriguing layer to this phenomenon, doesn't it? All those identical user interfaces and standardized coffee shops creating perfect conditions for manufactured déjà vu. Though I suspect Baudelaire would argue that true déjà vu requires more... organic triggers. Like the scent of old books or the particular way afternoon light filters through dust motes.
[B]: Hahaha你提到UI我就要cry了！😭 做design的时候经常觉得'这个button placement我绝对在哪里见过'，结果发现是上周做的另一个project...这算不算professional deja vu啊？💻🤔 

不过你说的organic triggers真的hit home！每次闻到acrylic颜料的味道，我都会突然想起art school的first year...那种感觉so intense！🎨✨ 

啊！说到light，昨天傍晚的golden hour简直perfect！我立刻drop everything跑去画sketch了~ 这种moment真的会让人feel connected to something bigger you know？☀️💛
[A]: Ah, golden hour... that reminds me of Browning's line about "the last red leaf that dances on the oldest bough." There's something distinctly Victorian about chasing transient light, though your acrylic paints make for rather more modern muses than our dear Browning had at his disposal. 

Professional déjà vu, you say? How very... meta. Though I suppose if we follow Proust's logic about involuntary memory, your design software might be the modern equivalent of his madeleine cakes. Just with significantly less poetry and considerably more command-Z.
[B]: LOL！Command-Z简直是我的life saver好吗！😂 不过你说到madeleine cakes...天啊我现在超想喝earl grey配马卡龙！☕️🍰 

Proust真的太relatable了~ 有时候我accidentally按到某个PS shortcut，突然就想起三年前做过的某个project...大脑的memory system真的好random啊！🤯💻 

Btw你说话真的好literary哦~ 让我想起art history课上那个超爱poetry的professor！不过我们digital artist比较practical啦，more like '这个color gradient需要调整'而不是'啊多么美丽的落日余晖'这样🤣🎨
[A]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. Though I must point out that Ruskin - that most fastidious of Victorian critics - would argue that noticing color gradients is itself a form of poetry. He once spent three pages describing the precise hue shift in a sunset over Coniston Water... rather excessive, even by my standards. 

Your accidental PS shortcuts do raise an interesting question though - is technological muscle memory the 21st century's answer to Proustian recollection? Instead of tea-soaked cakes triggering childhood memories, we get Ctrl+Alt+Z summoning half-forgotten design projects. How very... modern.
[B]: OMG Ruskin那个sunset description听起来so extra啊！😂 不过说真的，我们designer看color gradient的时候，内心戏可能比Ruskin还drama呢~ '这个transition不够smooth' '那个hue shift需要more depth'...🎨💫 

而且tech muscle memory真的太real了！有时候我睡着都能在梦里用PS shortcuts...朋友说我这是career hazard哈哈哈！💻😴 

不过比起Proust的madeleine，我宁愿要我的Wacom tablet和iced latte啦~ Modern problems require modern solutions am I right? ✌️☕️
[A]: How very... utilitarian of you. Though I can't help but wonder what Wordsworth would make of your Wacom tablet - he'd probably call it a "savage torpor" while secretly envying your undo function. The Romantics did so love their irreversible ink blots and crossed-out stanzas. 

Still, there's something to be said for your modern alchemy - turning pixels and shortcuts into art, with iced latte as your muse instead of laudanum. Progress, I suppose... though I'll keep my antique inkwells and properly steeped Earl Grey, thank you very much.
[B]: Pffft~ Wordsworth可以keep他的ink blots啦！🤣 我们digital artist的undo button就是the best invention ever好吗？No more crying over spilled ink~ 🎨✨ 

不过说真的，每次看到traditional artist用real paint我都会觉得好respect！那个technique和patience...omg！😲 虽然我还是会stick to我的iPad和Procreate啦~ 毕竟Ctrl+S就是我的peace of mind💆‍♀️💻 

啊！说到Earl Grey...我突然好想画一个steaming teacup的digital painting！With like, super detailed condensation droplets...brb gotta sketch this idea real quick! ☕️✏️
[A]: How charmingly spontaneous - though I must warn you, the Victorians would consider your haste quite vulgar. Rossetti once spent six months perfecting the reflection in a single teacup in his paintings... not that I'm suggesting you follow his example, mind you. The man did have rather too much time on his hands, even by academic standards. 

Do send me your digital teacup when it's done - I'm curious to see how your condensation droplets compare to Turner's famous watercolor studies of evaporation. Though I suspect your version will have significantly fewer layers of existential melancholy.
[B]: LMAO！Existential melancholy是什么鬼啦！😂 我的art style可是vibrant and happy的好吗~ 🌈✨ 

不过你说到Rossetti...天啊six months画一个teacup？！我的client通常只给six days deadline欸！😱 Modern art life is so different~ 

Okay okay我promise我的digital teacup会有最juicy的condensation droplets！With like, little rainbow reflections和super crisp details~ 虽然可能没有Turner的depth啦，but至少我的Wacom不会像他的watercolor paper一样warp掉！💦🎨 

Gotta run now~ Client just sent another 'urgent' revision request...the struggle is real！💻😫 Catch you later！✌️
[A]: Ah, the relentless march of deadlines - how very un-Romantic. Though I suppose even Keats had his impatient publishers... just without the luxury of email attachments and overnight revisions. 

Do humor your poor clients with their six-day demands, and remember: even Turner had to occasionally paint to commission. Though I doubt he ever received notes requesting "more vibrant, less existential" seascapes... 

Till next time, my digitally-distracted friend. May your droplets be juicy and your Ctrl keys responsive.
[B]: Hahaha你totally get it！😆 没错我们就是modern day Turner with anxiety and deadlines啦~ ⏳🎨 

不过说真的，下次我要画个super vibrant的seascape然后tag你！With extra rainbow droplets和zero existential crisis~ 🌊🌈 

Okay client is literally spamming my inbox now...TTYL！💻😵💫 
[A]:  How very... energetic. Though I suspect even the most avant-garde Pre-Raphaelite would balk at being tagged in a digital seascape. 

Do pacify your inbox tyrants - and remember, if the droplets prove particularly rainbow-esque, you might consider submitting them to the Royal Academy's summer exhibition. They've accepted stranger things... though perhaps not since 1843. 

Now off you go - your clients await, and my first edition of Tennyson's notebooks won't annotate itself. Ta-ta.
[B]: Byeee~！😘 我要去create some 'post-post-modern digital impressionism'气死那些Victorian ghosts啦！👻🎨 

PS: 如果Royal Academy不收我的rainbow droplets，我就post在Instagram上go viral！💥📱 Cheerio~！✨
[A]: How delightfully sacrilegious... though I daresay even Ruskin would have to admit your rainbow droplets would look rather striking next to his storm clouds. 

Do send me the Instagram link - I'll be the one leaving excessively verbose comments in iambic pentameter. Though I warn you, my emoji use will be strictly... ... period-appropriate. 

Now go forth and scandalize the art world, you digital heretic. Just don't tell the National Gallery I encouraged you.
[B]: LMAO你赢了！😂 iambic pentameter comments配上period-appropriate emojis...这绝对是art history meme material！📜🤣 

Okay deal！我画完第一个tag你~ 标题就叫"Rainbow Droplets: A Millennial's Clapback to the Victorian Era" 💦🌈 

Gotta jet~我的Adobe subscription不会renew itself！💸💻 Catch you on the flip side, my fellow art nerd！✌️🎨
