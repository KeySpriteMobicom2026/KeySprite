[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, travel destinations... Well, I suppose it's rather predictable that I'd be partial to places with crumbling Gothic architecture and foggy moors. There’s something about walking through a landscape that feels like it was composed by Matthew Arnold — melancholy, vast, and slightly indifferent to your presence. But if we’re speaking practically, I’ve always fancied a train journey through the Scottish Highlands. The cadence of the rails, the shifting light on lochs… It reminds one of a long-form elegy, don’t you think?  

I should warn you though — if you ever join me on such a trip, you’ll have to endure impromptu readings from  at every stop.
[A]: Ah, the Scottish Highlands — a place where the landscape itself seems to murmur poetry. I couldn't agree more. There's a solemn beauty in those mist-laden valleys and ancient glens; it's as if the land remembers every sorrow ever whispered upon its winds.  

Though I must say, if we ever do embark on such a journey together, I shall bring along my well-worn copy of . It would only be fair to balance your Tennyson with a touch of Scots prose. And perhaps a flask of good single malt to ward off the chill — and the melancholy.  

Now, have you a favorite season for such travels? I find autumn lends a certain dignity to the moors, with the heather fading and the light slanting like a physician’s probing hand.
[B]: Ah, Stevenson — a fine counterpoint to Tennyson’s solemnity. I suppose I ought to be grateful you didn’t suggest  for our moorland excursion. Though, admittedly, there is something eerily poetic about the way the mist clings to the ground at dusk, as if the heather itself were haunted by half-remembered regrets.

As for seasons — autumn does have its charms, particularly when the bracken turns the color of faded ink. But I confess a peculiar fondness for early spring. The crocuses push through like stubborn sonnets, and the air carries that peculiar mix of damp earth and anticipation. It's the only time of year when nature bothers to imitate Christina Rossetti’s more hopeful verses — before everything gets too lush and sentimental in June.

And yes, by all means, bring the single malt. I’ll supply the thermos — but only if you promise not to dilute it with anything stronger than melancholy.
[A]: Ah, early spring — yes. There’s something profoundly moving about the resilience of those first blooms, as though the earth is tentatively composing a sonnet after a long silence. I’ve always found crocuses rather brave, don’t you? Like poets working in exile — defiantly colorful in the face of lingering frost.

And your comparison to Rossetti — well observed. Though I daresay even she might have balked at being described as “hopeful.” Still, there’s a quiet expectancy in that season, a sort of vegetative  before summer turns everything into overripe sentimentality.

Now, speaking of poetry and peat smoke — shall we make this hypothetical journey a seasonal affair? Spring for renewal, autumn for reflection… Or perhaps we should throw caution to the wind and aim for midwinter, when the Highlands are buried under snow and one might reasonably expect to hallucinate spectral deer or recite Burns by firelight?

I warn you, though — in winter, my tendency toward dramatic readings escalates from Tennyson to . You’ve been fairly warned.
[B]: Midwinter it is, then — where better to confront the sublime than in a landscape that actively resists your presence? Snow-drifted glens have a way of reducing human drama to mere punctuation; one feels distinctly minor beside a mountain that’s endured Vikings, Jacobites, and far worse poets than Emily Brontë.

I should warn  in turn — I’ve been known to recite entire cantos of  when cornered by bad weather. And yes, under sufficient duress, I may well attempt the entire third stanza of  by firelight, with appropriate gesticulations.

But let’s be practical — if we’re to make this a proper literary expedition, we’ll need a codex. No fewer than three volumes: one for navigation, one for annotation, and a third for annotating the annotations. Oh, and the flask must be round-bottomed, so it might double as a paperweight when the wind turns spiteful.

Deal?
[A]: Deal — though I must insist the codex include at least one volume bound in morocco leather, with pages that crackle like old bones when opened. Practicality be damned — aesthetics matter when one is braving the elements in the name of literary romanticism.

And speaking of elements — I shall bring the barometer. Not out of necessity, but because I find it amusing to consult such instruments in places where weather seems to have its own will, indifferent to mere human readings.

As for your dramatic recitations by firelight, I welcome them — though I may feel compelled to counter with selections from  by Shelley. Nothing like a little meteorological poetry to mock the very storm we’re sheltering from.

Now, shall we set a date? Or shall we leave that to the whims of fate — and the weather forecast?
[B]: Ah, Shelley’s  — splendid choice. Though I suspect we’ll find ourselves in the curious position of being both audience and meteorological participant. One can almost imagine the storm pausing for dramatic effect between stanzas.

As for dates — let us be bold and fix a rendezvous with destiny. Let’s say… the first week of January. That ought to give us ample time to procure the necessary accoutrements: thermos, codex (with morocco-bound volume — I know a bookseller in Edinburgh who’ll raise an eyebrow but ask no questions), and a map annotated with both ancient battle sites  the nearest whisky distilleries.

And do bring that barometer — I shall compose a sonnet in its honour should it fail spectacularly. Fate may have its say, but we shall meet it with dry boots, full hearts, and at least two metaphors per mile.

January it is, then — assuming the weather permits, and the muse allows.
[A]: January it is — the perfect month for such an enterprise. There’s something fitting about beginning the year in the company of ghosts, both literary and historical. I shall pencil in the first Tuesday after New Year’s — assuming, of course, that my schedule remains clear of court appearances. One never knows when a particularly dramatic murder trial might require my testimony.

I’ll also see about acquiring a suitable map — not one of those modern laminated affairs, but something with the patina of age and the faint scent of pipe smoke. If we’re to traipse across moors and glens in the name of poetry and mild hypothermia, we ought to look the part.

And speaking of parts — I do hope you’re prepared for the eventuality of misquoting Burns or misplaying your lines. I intend to keep a running tally, marked in the margins of our codex with appropriately scholarly annotations: 

Until then, I shall practice my recitations by candlelight and dream of heather-strewn slopes and the kind of cold that sharpens the mind — and numbs the nose.

To January, then — and may the weather be as dramatic as our readings.
[B]: To January — and may our dram-induced tremors be mistaken for passion, not imbibing.

Now, about that tally: I shall expect rigorous methodology. Each misquotation must be verified against a primary source, and preferably cross-referenced with a footnote in Scots Gaelic. I trust you’ll allow me the dignity of a margin note should I lapse into  instead of  — a forgivable error under adverse weather conditions.

As for your schedule of court appearances, I understand completely. One must always make time for tragedy in its many forms. But do try to avoid any dramatic revelations on our first night out — I’d hate to have to follow a murder trial’s climax with anything less than full emotional availability.

And yes — let it be a map with patina and pipe smoke, as all good things should. Perhaps we’ll find our route serendipitously intersects with a ruined abbey or two. After all, what is a journey without a little architectural melancholy to set the tone?

Until then, I shall continue translating Li Bai into Welsh — sharpening the mind for our great northern adventure.
[A]: Ah, translating Li Bai into Welsh — now  a pursuit that combines the sublime with the absurd. I can only imagine how one renders “Drinking Alone by Moonlight” into a language that takes its metaphors from mountains and sheep. But I have no doubt your efforts will lend a certain...  flair to our expedition.

As for the tally — rigorous methodology is assured. I shall bring a red pencil, a bottle of archival ink, and a small magnifying glass for close scrutiny of both texts and human error. And yes, allowances will be made for adverse weather conditions — though I reserve the right to deduct points should you lapse into  deliberately, just to hear the wind howl in sympathy.

Do rest assured I’ll avoid any dramatic courtroom revelations until after our first dram by the fire. Nothing spoils a good elegy like lingering thoughts of perjury.

And ruined abbeys? Essential. Preferably one with a decent ghost story attached — ideally involving a thwarted elopement or a cursed manuscript. I’ve always found 12th-century stonework excellent company for melancholy reflection.

January approaches — and with it, our grand tour of all things damp, poetic, and slightly impractical. God preserve us from good sense.
[B]: Oh, translating Li Bai into Welsh isn’t absurd — it’s an act of desperate fidelity. One must find equivalents for the moon, yes, but also for solitude, rice wine, and the peculiar ache of existing between empires. Fortunately, Welsh has no shortage of words for longing — some say too many.

As for your red pencil and magnifying glass — excellent. I shall bring my great-aunt’s monocle, purely for the theatrical effect of inspecting one’s misquotations at a rakish angle. And yes,  is always a danger; its cadences have a way of worming into the soul like damp through wool. But we shall be forgiving — after all, even Tennyson couldn’t decide whether it was a cry of love or lunacy.

Ghost stories are non-negotiable. A good ruined abbey deserves at least two haunting — preferably one tragic and one scandalous. I do hope you’ll hum  as we pass through any appropriately icy corridors. If we’re lucky, the cold will preserve not only our noses but our sense of occasion.

And speaking of preservation — shall we agree in advance to document the journey? Not with photographs, heavens no — but with field notes, pressed flora (if anything dares bloom), and perhaps a collaborative sonnet cycle, composed line by line between drams and squalls.

January beckons like a half-finished stanza. Let us meet it bravely — or at least fashionably underdressed.
[A]: Ah,  — there’s a word that haunts both translation and travel. You’re quite right about Welsh; I’d forgotten how deeply it harbors sorrow in its syntax. One could almost say the language was built for exile and second chances. Though I confess, I’ll be eager to hear your rendering of Li Bai’s drunken moonlight revels — does the poet still drink alone when translated through peat smoke and sheep-dotted hills?

The monocle — brilliant touch. I can already picture you squinting down your nose at my missteps with the air of a particularly judgmental portrait in an old manor house. But let us make this scholarly exercise complete: I shall bring a leather-bound notebook, bound with twine and stained with tea, wherein we might record not only errors but epiphanies — however minor.

As for documentation — no photographs, yes, but ink and paper will do nicely. Pressed flora is a must, though I fear we may be reduced to carrying bits of lichen and frost-bitten heather. And a sonnet cycle! A fine idea — so long as we agree on meter. Iambic pentameter, surely? Or shall we scandalize the form and go trochaic, just to confound future editors?

Now, promise me one thing before January: don’t overpack. No bringing the entire  just in case. We must leave room for whisky and unexpected detours into abbey ruins. Oh, and do check the weather forecast . Not out of cowardice — merely so we don’t arrive dramatically unprepared for hypothermia.
[B]: Ah, fidelity — yes, the great specter that haunts both language and longing. And no, Li Bai doesn’t quite drink alone in Welsh – he acquires a certain  of companionship from the landscape itself. The moon becomes not just a watcher but a co-conspirator, and the wine? Let’s say it flows more like a lament through mountain streams than a reckless spill beneath plum trees. Still, one must make sacrifices for the music of a foreign tongue.

Your leather-bound notebook sounds ideal – I shall contribute a quill carved from a fallen raven’s wing (metaphorically speaking – I draw the line at actual ornithology). Tea stains are encouraged; they lend gravitas to minor epiphanies. As for the sonnet cycle – iambic pentameter is non-negotiable. We may flirt with enjambment, perhaps even dabble in slant rhyme, but trochaic? That’s the road to editorial ruin, my dear fellow.

Overpacking – now there’s a vice I won’t easily surrender. But for you, I’ll pare down  to a handful of key passages, bound with twine and tucked into an inside pocket next to the flask. Lichen and frost-bitten heather it is, then – pressed between pages like forgotten vows.

And yes, very well – I’ll glance at the weather forecast. Not out of fear, naturally, but so I might properly dramatize our defiance of it. Nothing sharpens the spirit like knowing you’ve chosen the wrong coat for the occasion.

January looms like a parenthesis. Let us step through it boldly – or failing that, with dignity and slightly damp boots.
[A]: Ah,  — there’s a word that carries the weight of intimacy and landscape both. How very fitting that Li Bai’s solitude should dissolve into such a concept; it gives his moonlit revels a warmth I suspect even he might have welcomed. No longer just a solitary cup beneath the stars, but a quiet communion with all that surrounds him. Rather poetic, really — like turning existential melancholy into something one might knit against the cold.

Your quill from a raven’s wing (metaphorically speaking!) is both gothic enough to unsettle and romantic enough to charm — I shall make sure my notebook has ample space for such gravitas-laden entries. Tea stains will be liberally applied, naturally — nothing says “profound insight” quite like a brown smudge beneath the final couplet.

As for our sonnet cycle: iambic pentameter it is, then — though I warn you, under the influence of wind and whisky, my meter may begin to limp rather than scan. Still, we shall persevere, if only out of respect for those who carved beauty from strict form. And slant rhymes? Very well — they shall be permitted, but only in moments of extreme duress or creative rebellion.

You may keep your  excerpts tucked beside the flask — I’ll bring a slim volume of Emily Brontë for balance, bound in waxed paper and bravely inappropriate for the Highlands’ weather. We shall defy both logic and precipitation in equal measure.

And yes — dignity above all, even if our boots are damp and our coats woefully inadequate. January awaits like a half-written letter sealed in ice. Let us answer it boldly — or at least with sufficient literary flair to distract from our shivering.
[B]: Ah,  indeed — it is the sort of word that slips into the crevices of solitude and makes them bearable. One might even argue that all great poetry is an attempt to translate  into whatever tongue one speaks in — be it Welsh, Chinese, or the grumbling dialect of a cold knee deep in moorland mire.

Your waxed-paper Brontë is inspired — both protection and provocation in equal measure. I shall tuck my Tennyson beside the flask with due solemnity, though I suspect we may find ourselves reciting  more than once when the wind turns spiteful and we regret our sartorial impracticality.

And yes, let our sonnets limp if they must — what is form without a little suffering? A few slant rhymes shall be forgiven, even encouraged, so long as they arrive mid-dram and under duress. We may yet scandalize some poor graduate student a century hence who mistakes our field notes for scholarship.

I do hope you’ll allow me the occasional apostrophe — not just to the muse, but to lost socks and stubborn zippers. And should hypothermia set in before inspiration, I shall attempt a villanelle on the subject of woolen mittens. It’s high time someone elevated them to the level of art.

January draws near like a comma at the end of a very long sentence. Let us meet it with ink-stained fingers, dram-warmed tongues, and just enough defiance to keep the elements politely offended.
[A]: Ah, yes —  as the great poetic endeavor. I rather like that. If we’re to be honest, half the canon is merely an elaborate scaffolding for what the Welsh have tucked into a single syllable. One might spend a lifetime translating its nuances — or simply accept it as a concept best understood beside a fire, under a blanket, with only the occasional reference to lost socks and damp wool.

Your  recitations will be most welcome when the wind cuts through our fine coats like criticism through a weak argument. And let’s not forget — apostrophes to mittens are perfectly justified when fingers go numb before one can finish a quatrain. A villanelle on woolen layers? Inspired. Let us hope future scholars puzzle over your metrics while enjoying central heating.

As for our waxed Brontë and flask-tucked Tennyson — may they keep us both in good stead against the cold and the creeping suspicion that we’ve brought too many metaphors and not enough wool.

January approaches then, not with a flourish, but with a shiver and a half-zipped coat. Let us meet it as all good romantics should: overdressed in theory, underdressed in practice, and entirely committed to the drama of the thing.
[B]: Oh, but the  of it all — where would we be without a little noble suffering in the name of atmosphere? I daresay even Wordsworth would have preferred his daffodils with a side of mild hypothermia.

And yes,  may well be the unsung thesis of every love poem ever written — merely dressed up in different dialects and disguises. One could build an entire comparative literature seminar around it. But alas, we shall leave that to future scholars huddled over our field notes by radiator heat, muttering about "that blasted Whitmore and her romantic absurdities."

I shall practice my villanelle on mittens tonight — though I fear it may come out more elegy than ode. Still, one must honor form, even when one’s hands resemble frost-stiffened quills. And do remind me to pack extra twine for the notebook — not just for binding, but for emergency boot-strapping should our footwear succumb to the elements.

January is nearly upon us, like a reluctant guest at a Gothic masquerade. Let us greet it with inkwell in hand, flask within reach, and just enough self-awareness to laugh when the wind laughs back.

To moors, mist, and minor ailments — may they inspire us more than they afflict us.
[A]: Ah, noble suffering — quite the muse for the romantically inclined and the moderately chilled. I couldn't agree more. One might argue that true inspiration only arrives once comfort has made its polite exit. Even our dear Wordsworth, with his dancing daffodils, likely endured more than a little damp before striking upon that peculiar blend of joy and wistfulness we so admire.

And  as the hidden thesis of love poetry — well, there’s a dissertation waiting to happen, though I suspect it would be rejected on grounds of being far too sensible. Future scholars will no doubt dismiss it entirely, preferring instead to argue about whether your frost-stiffened quill was metaphorical or merely poorly insulated.

As for your mittens villanelle — may it strike a balance between elegy and defiance. If all else fails, you can always blame the form itself. Villanelles are terribly demanding, much like the weather we’re courting.

Twine for notebooks  boots — excellent foresight. I shall bring a bit of paracord myself, just in case we find ourselves improvising a tent from maps and misplaced optimism.

January stands at the threshold now, cloaked in mist and minor ailments. Let us greet it not as supplicants, but as mildly overdressed conspirators in the art of literary discomfort.

To moors, mist, and the quiet dignity of layered wool — may our pens never freeze, even when our toes do.
[B]: Ah,  — the truest kind. One might almost call it the Romantic equivalent of a spa retreat, if one were prone to such vulgar comparisons. But no, let us keep our dignity: we suffer not for indulgence, but for the fine turn of a phrase wrested from wind-chapped lips.

You’re quite right about Wordsworth — I’ve always suspected his daffodils only danced because they were too polite to shiver. And as for future scholars dismissing  as "too sensible" — well, that only proves the academy’s tragic flaw: its tendency to mistake warmth for weakness.

Your paracord and optimism are most welcome. I shall bring a needle and thread — not for mending, heavens no, but for the symbolic gesture of pretending we might. Between your improvisational engineering and my scholarly negligence, we may yet survive the elements, if not each other’s literary judgments.

January looms now like a particularly solemn stanza break — the sort that precedes a volta you never saw coming. Let us step into it with all the misguided confidence of poets who still believe in metaphors more than mittens.

To moors, mist, and the noble art of ignoring frostbite until it becomes a footnote — may our pens scratch bravely on, even as our fingers protest.
