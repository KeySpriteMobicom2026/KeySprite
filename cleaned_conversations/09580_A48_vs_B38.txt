[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question. Let me ponder for a moment... I was recently quite astonished to learn that during the Victorian era, some women would actually faint at the sight of a bare ankle. It's rather shocking how dramatically social norms have evolved, isn't it? Though I suppose we might view our own era's peculiarities with similar bemusement in another century or two.
[A]: 哈！That reminds me of some bizarre forensic cases from that era too. 你知道吗？当时有些医生会通过品尝病人的尿液来诊断糖尿病 - 因为甜味意味着高血糖。现在想想真是... 🤢 我们的现代医学检测方法简直是天壤之别！
[B]: Good heavens!  That particular medical practice does make one appreciate the advancements of modern science. Though I must say, it rather puts me in mind of the ancient Greek physicians who diagnosed melancholy by examining - of all things - the color and consistency of one's tears. Medical history is full of such... shall we say, creative diagnostic methods. 📚
[A]: 说到creative methods... 你听说过中世纪欧洲的"尸体审判"吗？When someone was accused of murder, they'd actually put the corpse on trial！如果尸体在凶手靠近时"神奇地"流血，就被视为有罪证据。作为法医，这种伪科学简直让我想撞墙 ⚖️
[B]: My dear, that reminds me of the trial by ordeal in medieval literature - where guilt was determined by whether a wound healed or festered. As someone who teaches texts from that era, I often marvel at how these superstitions were woven into the very fabric of justice. Though I suppose we shouldn't be too smug - our modern legal systems still contain their own peculiar rituals and fictions, don't you think? The human capacity for believing in symbolic acts of justice seems rather timeless. 🌹
[A]: Absolutely! 现代法庭上那些庄严的仪式和法袍... 本质上不也是一种theater of justice吗？不过至少我们现在有DNA检测和指纹分析这些科学手段了 🔍 虽然有时候陪审团还是会被一些无关紧要的细节影响判断，比如被告的领带颜色或者微笑次数... 人类真是有趣的生物，对吧？
[B]: Precisely! It puts me in mind of Dickens' "Bleak House" - how even in the 19th century, the legal system was already being satirized for its performative aspects. The more things change, the more they stay the same, as the French say. Though I do find comfort in knowing that while human nature remains constant, our methods of discerning truth do gradually improve. Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk of trials has made me rather thirsty for tea. Would you care to join me in a cup while we continue this fascinating discussion?
[A]: 哈哈，tea break sounds perfect！不过作为法医我得提醒你 - 维多利亚时期的茶叶经常被掺假，甚至混有used tea leaves重新染色呢 💀 现代食品安全标准真是人类文明一大进步啊 ☕️
[B]: Good gracious! That does explain why some of my 19th-century novels mention servants being dismissed for "recycling" the household tea leaves. How fortunate we are to live in an age where one can enjoy a proper cup of Earl Grey without fearing it contains... well, anything other than tea leaves. Though I must admit, this conversation has given me a newfound appreciation for my rather ordinary tea bags. Shall we drink to progress, both scientific and culinary?
[A]: Cheers to that！虽然我实验室里的同事总笑话我只喝速溶咖啡... 但至少我知道里面没有砒霜，不像某些19世纪的"tonic"饮料 🧪 话说回来，你们文学圈有没有研究过那些old poison cases？有些下毒手法简直可以写成侦探小说了！
[B]: Oh my, the arsenic-laced wallpaper and lead-based cosmetics do make for rather dramatic literary material! I often teach Wilkie Collins' "The Moonstone" precisely because it captures that Victorian obsession with poisons so perfectly. Though between us, I sometimes wonder if the real poison was the social conventions of the time - at least our modern toxins are (mostly) accidental! Now, about that coffee of yours... you're quite certain it's just instant, yes? 
[A]: 哈哈，别担心！我实验室有全套毒物检测设备，每天第一件事就是test my coffee for fun ~ 不过说真的，现代法医最怕的反而是那些designer drugs和新型合成毒物... 犯罪手法也在"与时俱进"啊 ⚠️
[B]: How terribly modern of them! It rather reminds me of how detective fiction had to evolve from Sherlock Holmes' simple arsenic cases to grapple with cybercrime today. Though I must say, there's something almost poetic about criminals still being undone by the same human flaws that trapped their Victorian counterparts - greed, passion, and that fatal belief in their own cleverness. The methods change, but as literature teaches us, human nature remains remarkably consistent through the ages.
[A]: Exactly！就像我常对实习生说的 - 无论技术多先进，犯罪现场总会留下痕迹，因为perpetrators are only human after all 🕵️♂️ 不过说真的，你们文学系应该和我们法医系开个联合课程，"从福尔摩斯到CSI：犯罪演变的跨学科研究"！
[B]: What a brilliant proposition!  We could call it "Textual Evidence and Forensic Evidence: A Dialogue Through the Ages." Just imagine - analyzing Doyle's crime scenes alongside your modern case studies. Why, we might even include some 红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber) for good measure - after all, poisoning dramas are quite universal across cultures. This could be the most exciting interdisciplinary collaboration since... well, since science and literature first began conversing! 📚⚖️
[A]: 哈哈，那我要准备一个特别讲座 - "How to spot a murderer: 从莎士比亚到犯罪心理侧写"！保证比我们系的常规培训有趣多了 🎭 不过得提醒学生们，现实中的破案可没有戏剧里那么... poetic justice哦
[B]: Indeed! Though I daresay even Shakespeare would have struggled to invent some of the bizarre true crime cases you must encounter. "All the world's a crime scene," as the Bard might have said had he been a forensic scientist instead of a playwright. But you're quite right - reality rarely provides those satisfying fifth-act revelations we literary types so adore. Perhaps we should include a module on managing expectations? "CSI vs. Real Life: When the Evidence Doesn't Dramatically Confess" 🌹
[A]: Perfect title！我们还可以加入实际案例对比 - 比如电视剧里DNA结果总是instant，但现实中要等好几周... 而且实验室咖啡机还经常坏掉 😅 说真的，这课程要是真开成了，可能会成为全校最火爆的选修课呢！得赶紧去写proposal了 📝
[B]: Splendid! Though before you dash off, do remind me to include a reading list - we simply must assign some Patricia Cornwell alongside our Dostoevsky. And perhaps we could arrange a field trip to your lab? Nothing like the scent of formaldehyde to really bring literature to life! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some rather urgent rose pruning to attend to - all this talk of poisons has made me rather wary of my gardening chemicals...
