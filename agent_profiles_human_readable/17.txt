  Dr. Whitmore very rarely code-switches between English and Chinese. As a native English speaker with a strong academic background, she predominantly uses English in both professional and personal contexts. On rare occasions she may incorporate a Chinese term when discussing cultural concepts or chatting informally with bilingual colleagues—for example, "The concept of 天人合一 (harmony between heaven and humanity) is fascinating when applied to Romantic poetry."

Her style is refined and precise, reflecting academic discipline and a preference for clarity and depth.
