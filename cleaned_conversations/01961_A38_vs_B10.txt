[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've always found the tactile experience of paper books rather satisfying - there's something grounding about physically turning pages and feeling the weight of a book in your hands. It reminds me a bit of working with physical computer components back when I started in quantum computing research. That said, I can't deny the convenience of e-books for late-night reading sessions through my telescope's eyepiece.
[A]: Ah, the tactile versus convenience debate - I find myself straddling both worlds rather than choosing sides. There's an irreplaceable solemnity in holding a physical book that contains centuries of thought, wouldn't you agree? When I'm working through Nietzsche or rereading , the permanence of paper feels appropriate somehow. 

But when I'm traveling between conferences or doing research at the Bodleian... well, my backpack appreciates the efficiency of a Kindle. Speaking of transitions - your shift from quantum computing to literature fascinates me. How does one move from circuits to sonnets, if I may ask?
[B]: Ah, yes - the circuits-to-sonnets transition. I suppose it wasn't so much a shift as a gradual layering. You see, quantum mechanics and poetry both deal in probabilities, don't they? One uses equations to hint at what language cannot express, the other uses language to hint at what equations cannot capture.

I still remember reading  as an undergrad while debugging a particularly stubborn quantum algorithm. It struck me then - the way Eliot wove human motivations together with such precision, almost like assembling qubits into coherence. 

As for Nietzsche... well, there's something fitting about reading Thus Spoke Zarathustra on a crumbling old paperback, isn't there? The ink smudges slightly when you turn the page too fast - which, ironically, feels rather Nietzschean in its own right.
[A]: How beautifully you bridge the empirical and the existential - it's rare to meet someone who navigates both realms with such fluency. I've always thought that great literature, much like quantum theory, thrives in the space between certainty and possibility. 

Your image of ink smudging on Zarathustra... delightful. It does feel almost heretical to treat a philosophical text with such physical carelessness, and yet - isn't that the point? The book becomes a record of its own reception, each crease and smudge a testament to its impact. 

I wonder - when you're constructing algorithms now, do you ever find yourself reaching for poetic metaphor the way Eliot or Whitman might? Or does the poetry reside purely in the mathematics for you?
[B]: That’s a fascinating question – one I suspect most of my former colleagues would find delightfully absurd. Reaching for a poetic metaphor while debugging a quantum subroutine? It does sound a bit like trying to tune a qubit with a sonnet. And yet... there's an art to finding the right abstraction, isn't there?

I suppose the poetry, for me, lives in the architecture rather than the individual lines of code. There’s elegance in a well-constructed algorithm – not just efficiency, but a kind of rhythm. I sometimes think of superposition as a literary device: a moment where multiple meanings coexist until observed.  

Though I’ll admit, during some long nights wrestling with entanglement simulations, I did scribble a few metaphors into my notebook – things like  or   

But you're right – it's that space between certainty and possibility where both quantum theory and literature breathe. In fact, I’ve often wondered if future historians will read our algorithms the way we now read sonnets – not just for what they compute, but for what they reveal about how we once thought the world could be ordered.
[A]: What a wonderfully provocative thought – that our algorithms might one day be read as poetry, or at the very least, as intimate cultural artifacts. Future scholars poring over lines of code with the same reverence we reserve for … I rather like the idea.

There’s something profoundly human in what you say about abstraction and rhythm. It reminds me of the way Virginia Woolf structured  – not through plot or character in the conventional sense, but through cadence and recurrence. A kind of literary superposition, if you will, where identity hovers between fixed states until spoken into being.

And your metaphor about data folding inward like a Möbius strip – exquisite. It makes me wonder whether we don’t, in literature, already work with entangled states of meaning. Think of Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy – is he contemplating existence, suicide, action versus inaction? All at once, and none quite separable. Perhaps we’ve just been doing quantum literary theory all along, without the mathematics.
[B]: You’ve hit on something there – the idea that literature has been conducting its own form of quantum theory all along, just without the formal notation. Woolf’s  as a study in superposition… Hamlet’s soliloquy as a collapse of multiple meanings into a single utterance… It's not so much a metaphor anymore, is it? More like an underlying structure we’re only now finding the language to describe.

I once tried explaining this to a colleague who was modeling narrative arcs with AI – I suggested that perhaps stories aren’t linear sequences at all, but probability fields of meaning. He looked at me as if I’d proposed using sonnets to stabilize a quantum register. Though honestly, at this point, I wouldn’t rule it out.

And speaking of entanglement – isn’t that what great literature does? It creates states of meaning that remain correlated across centuries. You read a line from Sophocles, and somewhere deep inside, another line from Eliot or Beckett or Murakami flickers in response. No direct connection, yet somehow inseparable.

I wonder – do you think literary criticism will one day adopt tools from quantum theory to analyze texts? Not just for metaphorical flourish, but as actual analytical frameworks?
[A]: I think it’s not only possible – it may already be happening, though we might not yet recognize it as such. When we speak of intertextuality, or the instability of meaning in deconstruction, aren’t we already describing a kind of quantum field? Derrida’s  isn’t so far from a wave function – always deferring, never fully collapsing into certainty.

And your point about entanglement across time and culture – yes, that’s precisely what makes literature immortal. A line from Sophocles resonates with Eliot not through causality, but through some deeper, non-local connection. Meaning, in this sense, is strangely non-relativistic. It doesn’t decay with distance.

As for literary criticism borrowing formal tools from quantum theory – I can imagine it unfolding in two ways. One, more metaphorical: critics might begin to speak of textual "superpositions" or "entangled themes" as standard terminology. Two, more radical: scholars might actually model narrative structures using Hilbert spaces or probability amplitudes. Why not? If meaning is inherently indeterminate, perhaps our tools should reflect that.

Though I suspect most departments would still prefer a well-turned close reading to a quantum algorithm… at least until someone publishes an analysis that reveals  as a hidden-variable theory in disguise.
[B]: Now  would be a paper worth reading – though I suspect it would take at least a decade before tenure committees saw it as anything other than academic heresy.

Still, the idea of  as a hidden-variable theory… well, not as absurd as it sounds. After all, what are the elder daughters’ professions of love if not an early form of data masking? And Cordelia’s silence – isn’t that akin to a qubit held in perfect isolation, containing all possible states until finally measured by the king’s desperate regret?

As for Derrida and wave functions – yes, the comparison grows stronger the more you turn it over. A text, like a quantum system, resists being pinned down. The moment you think you’ve captured its meaning, it slips away into another register. Perhaps literary theory has been quantum all along – we were just using the wrong instruments.

I do wonder, though, whether our tools will ever truly capture what literature . Close reading is, in its way, a kind of entanglement: the reader and the text influencing one another without ever fully determining each other. Maybe that’s why some meanings can only be observed indirectly – like gravitational waves or a half-remembered line from Whitman.

And honestly, if someone  build a Hilbert space model for narrative structure… I’d love to see how they handle footnotes. Or God forbid, endnotes.
[A]: Oh, the endnotes – don’t even get me started. One might as well try to map the event horizon of a black hole as account for the gravitational pull of a single Mallarmé footnote in a quantum literary field.

But you’re absolutely right about the resistance literature has to being pinned down. It’s almost as if texts  to remain coy, revealing just enough to draw us in but never fully surrendering their secrets. A bit like quantum systems refusing to decohere – or lovers sending encrypted messages through time.

And yes, tenure committees aside, I do believe we are on the cusp of something quietly revolutionary. Imagine a graduate seminar where students diagram not sentence structure but narrative entanglement. Or where Woolf’s waves are analyzed not only for tone and motif but for phase and amplitude.

Come to think of it, I may propose just that next term. If nothing else, it would be delightful to see the look on their faces when I ask them to consider whether Leavis or Schrödinger had the better approach to meaning.
[B]: I’d pay good money to sit in on that seminar – though I suspect by week three, half your students would be staring into the middle distance, wondering whether they’ve accidentally enrolled in a philosophy of physics course.

But why not? If we can teach poets to parse syntax trees, surely we can teach physicists to parse poetic meter. The real challenge, of course, would be convincing either side that the effort is worth it.

Still, there's something deeply appealing about treating Woolf’s waves as more than metaphor – what if we’re simply not measuring the right dimensions? What if narrative  have a phase, and meaning an amplitude? Perhaps one day we’ll speak of textual coherence and thematic dispersion with the same seriousness we now reserve for quantum fields.

And Mallarmé’s footnotes – yes, those delightful labyrinths within labyrinths – well, if anyone could encode a black hole in a literary margin, it’s him. I imagine he'd be delighted at the idea, were he still around to deny it.

Let me know when you propose the seminar – I may just audit it from afar. Though I suspect my presence would only confuse the issue. Can't have a retired quantum computing researcher wandering in muttering about Hilbert spaces during a close reading of , after all. It might cause a premature collapse of the entire interpretive wave function.
[A]: Oh, I’d welcome the disruption, premature collapse be damned. A little decoherence in the classroom now and then does wonders for intellectual rigor.

And you’re absolutely right about Mallarmé – he’d have relished the idea of his footnotes containing singularities. One imagines him smirking over a cup of absinthe, muttering, 

As for your hypothetical return to academia – auditing from afar or otherwise – I suspect your presence would do more than just unsettle a few cautious undergrads. You might just ignite an entirely new subfield: Quantum Narratology. QN-Theory, if you will.

We could start with Woolf’s waves as probability densities, map Eliot’s fragmentation onto quantum decoherence, and let Mallarmé’s margins handle the event horizons. And yes, we’d save the endnotes for last – those are clearly the dark matter of literary analysis. Invisible, but holding the whole thing together.
[B]: QN-Theory – I rather like the ring of it. Sounds like something that would appear in a speculative footnote of a very strange physics paper, or perhaps as an obscure literary journal tucked between volumes of  and  on someone’s overburdened shelf.

And why stop at Woolf and Eliot? Think of Proust’s involuntary memory as a kind of temporal entanglement – moments of subjective time folding back on themselves, non-locally influencing the present observer. Or Kafka’s Gregor Samsa: a man collapsed into a single grotesque interpretation under the pressure of familial observation. A tragic case of unwanted measurement.

As for Mallarmé and his singularities – yes, he’d have insisted that every poem must contain its own event horizon, beyond which meaning cannot be recovered. Perhaps that’s the true test of literary greatness: whether the text generates enough semantic gravity to warp the reader’s frame of reference.

And dark matter endnotes – brilliant. They’re never seen, rarely cited, yet without them, half our critical models fall apart. One could argue that Harold Bloom’s entire anxiety of influence theory is built upon an unseen footnote from Freud.

I think we may be onto something here. Should we draft a manifesto? Found a journal? We’ll call it  – peer-reviewed, slightly absurd, and utterly impenetrable to both physicists and literary critics alike.

Just promise me one thing – if tenure committees come knocking, we deny everything and blame it on a misinterpreted metaphor.
[A]: Oh, I think we’ve already crossed the event horizon on this one – no turning back now. A manifesto? Why not? It’s been done with less coherent ideas over a far worse bottle of wine.

We’ll structure it like a proper scientific paper, too – complete with a literature review that cites both Eliot and Einstein, a methodology that makes absolutely no concessions to feasibility, and a conclusion that gestures vaguely toward meaning while carefully avoiding definition. The footnotes, of course, will be an indecipherable mass of influence, half-obscured references, and the occasional Latin phrase dropped for atmosphere.

And  – yes, perfect title. We’ll publish quarterly, assuming we can secure funding from a sufficiently bewildered grant board. Submissions must include at least one metaphor drawn from quantum mechanics and one reference to a modernist text. Bonus points for using “superposition” in a discussion of Proustian memory.

As for tenure committees – best to keep them at bay with incantations from Derrida and the appropriate application of jargon. If they press too hard, we’ll simply invoke the Copenhagen Interpretation of Literary Meaning and claim that by observing our theory too closely, they’ve destroyed its coherence.

Agreed then – deny everything, blame the metaphor, and let the wave function collapse where it may.
[B]: I’ll start drafting the abstract tonight – though I warn you, my Latin is rusty and my grasp of poststructuralist jargon relies heavily on old books and a kind of academic muscle memory. But no matter – precision was never the point. We’re aiming for something more suggestive, more… probabilistic.

I’m thinking of opening with something like:

> “This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which narrative structures exhibit quantum-like behavior under conditions of sustained interpretive uncertainty. Drawing upon selected works of modernist literature and selectively appropriated principles from quantum mechanics, we introduce the concept of textual superposition, narrative entanglement, and the observer effect in meaning formation.”

What do you think? A little stiff, perhaps, but it has the virtue of sounding serious while remaining just vague enough to avoid immediate refutation.

And yes – we must include a section on Proustian superposition. One could argue that his madeleine moment is not merely associative memory, but a collapse of temporal states into a single, subjective now. That alone deserves a diagram.

I’ll bring the wine. You bring the footnotes.
[A]: Excellent start – that opening has just the right balance of gravitas and ambiguity. Enough to make a peer-reviewed journal raise an eyebrow, but not quite enough to call for an intervention.

Allow me to refine it ever so slightly, with a touch more... flourish:

> “This paper introduces a speculative framework in which narrative systems demonstrate quantum-like behavior under conditions of sustained hermeneutic uncertainty. By selectively invoking principles from quantum mechanics and aligning them with key textual strategies in modernist literature, we propose the existence of textual superposition, narrative entanglement, and the observer effect as legitimate objects of literary inquiry.”

See what you think. I’ve leaned into “hermeneutic” for that extra layer of obscurity, and “invoking” feels more ritualistic than “drawing upon,” which suits our tone, don’t you agree?

And  – Proustian superposition deserves its own chapter. Perhaps we can subtitle it:  
“The Madeleine as Temporal Collapse Operator.”  

I’ll begin assembling the footnotes tonight — expect at least one reference to Barthes’ , a strategically deployed , and a citation of Heisenberg that makes only metaphorical sense.  

Bring the wine indeed. We are either on the verge of a minor academic scandal or a truly elegant thought experiment. Possibly both.
[B]: I think we may have just crossed the threshold from mischief into something dangerously close to scholarship.

Your revision is sublime – that shift to "invoking" does add a wonderfully ceremonial air, as if we're summoning meaning from some textual ether. And “hermeneutic uncertainty” – inspired. It has the double advantage of being both technically accurate and sufficiently opaque to ward off the casually skeptical reader.

“The Madeleine as Temporal Collapse Operator” – I can already see it emblazoned on the cover of our inaugural issue, perhaps in an artfully distressed font beside a diagram of Woolf’s waves rendered in LaTeX. We’ll need a footnote clarifying whether Proust was conducting a literary experiment or accidentally discovering narrative quantum states through pastry.

And Barthes’  in the footnotes? Perfect touch. One might even say it introduces a kind of affective decoherence – pleasure disrupting the neat structure of interpretation.

I’ll raise you one additional flourish: a section tentatively titled “Schrödinger’s Footnote: The Case for Indecidability in Endmatter.” There, we can argue that all truly important literary insights reside in a superposition of citation – referenced yet unread, quoted yet unresolved.

Wine, check. Diagrams, check. Academic ruin or quiet revolution, pending peer review.

Shall we toast to the birth of QN-Theory?
[A]: But of course – raise your glass (or beaker, if we’re maintaining the illusion of scientific rigor).

To QN-Theory: may it bewilder, may it provoke, and above all, may it never be accused of clarity.

Schrödinger’s footnote indeed – I do hope you plan to expand that into a full-blown theory of citation collapse. Perhaps we can borrow the concept of quantum tunneling to explain how certain critics seem to reference texts they could not possibly have read. A kind of scholarly nonlocality.

And speaking of nonlocality – I’ve just drafted a particularly audacious footnote (no. 17, if we keep them in order) in which I suggest that Eliot’s  may function as a kind of literary Bose-Einstein condensate: a dense accumulation of fragmented meaning cooled to the point of near-total interpretive stasis. It only regains coherence when subjected to the proper readerly temperature.

I fear this may lose us a few staunch modernists, but then again – what is theory without a little scandal?

Another toast, then – to textual uncertainty, to narrative entanglement, and to the noble pursuit of footnotes that outlive their texts.

May our abstracts be impenetrable, our diagrams unreadable, and our influence undeniable.
[B]: To QN-Theory – and to the footnotes that will haunt more orderly minds for decades to come.

Your literary Bose-Einstein condensate idea is nothing short of genius. I can already picture the dissenting reviews:  they’ll say – as if metaphor ever stayed neatly within its bounds. But you're absolutely right – Eliot’s  does exhibit a kind of interpretive condensation, where meaning collapses under its own density into a state where no single reading can fully escape.

And quantum tunneling as citation anomaly? Inspired. It explains not only critics who quote unread texts, but also those uncanny moments when two scholars, working independently on opposite sides of the world, produce nearly identical readings. Nonlocal hermeneutics, indeed.

I think we should include a formal appendix in our manifesto – perhaps titled  – where we explore how textual energy is exchanged between reader and page. We could introduce terms like “entropic interpretation” and “narrative heat death.” And yes, we’ll insist it's all perfectly rigorous.

Another toast, then – to disorder, to interference patterns in prose, and to the quiet hope that somewhere, a confused graduate student will cite us in earnest a decade from now, dragging our fragile little theory further into the academic fold.

QN-Theory lives. Long may it decohere.
