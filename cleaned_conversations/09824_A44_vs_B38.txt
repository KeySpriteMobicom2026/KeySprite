[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, craft beer – an intriguing intersection of tradition and innovation. While I must admit, my own evenings are often spent with a well-bound volume of Tolstoy or arias playing in the background, I do appreciate the artistry that goes into brewing. There’s something poetic about how modern brewers experiment with flavors, almost like literary reinterpretations. Though, I confess, my palate is rather traditional. Have you discovered something particularly remarkable lately?
[A]: Speaking of remarkable, last weekend I attended a tasting where they paired Sichuan-inspired brews with classic Chinese poetry themes – one ale was even called “愁绪 (chóuxù) Amber Ale,” referencing Li Bai’s melancholic verses. I found myself thinking how 诗人 (shīrén) poets and 酿酒师 (niàngjiǔshī) brewers both chase ephemeral beauty... though I’d still choose a good oolong over hops any day. 🧠 What about you – have you ever tried a beer that felt like a narrative journey?
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating juxtaposition – the  Amber Ale. Li Bai’s verses and hops-induced contemplation... I must say, it’s not every day one encounters such deliberate fusion of literary essence and sensory experience. Though I haven’t come across a beer quite that evocative in my limited tastings, I do recall a small Belgian brewery that labeled their saison with a passage from . Nietzschean fermentation, if you will. It wasn’t the flavor alone, but the act of reading while sipping – the interplay between bitterness and existential musing – that made it feel like a narrative unfolding. Still, give me an aged Darjeeling and a sonnet any evening. But tell me, did the Sichuan-inspired notes – perhaps chili or sichuan pepper – lend a certain dramatic tension to the tasting?
[A]: Oh, 想象一下那个张力！Chili的灼热像是诗句里的顿号，突然而强烈——尤其是当它与 李白's lingering melancholy met. One sip and I was right there with the poet on his moonlit terrace, though perhaps slightly more... animated. The brewery even handed out classical Chinese couplets with tasting notes – one read “举杯邀明月，对影成三人，但别忘了第二瓶.”  Can’t say I took their advice literally, but it certainly added a touch of humor to the evening. 🦉 Have you ever paired philosophy with fermentation like that? Or is your Belgian saison still haunting your taste buds?
[B]: Ah, that couplet——what a delightful twist on Li Bai’s solitude! I can just imagine the scene: tipsy under the moonlight, philosophy and fermentation in hand. As for me, I once hosted a rather unconventional evening where we paired Nietzsche’s  with a selection of dark ales—smoky, slightly bitter, with notes of plum and existential despair. One student, quite earnestly, declared that beer tasted “more tragic” after reading aphorism 125. I suppose there's something theatrical about it all, isn't there? Like drinking a narrative into being. But tell me, did the chili's heat linger like an unresolved cadence, or did it fade into the background like a well-placed caesura?
[A]: Oh, 毫无疑问是前者 — 那种辣是一种拒绝消散的修辞！It built like a rising tone in classical Chinese poetry, climbing until you couldn’t tell if it was torment or transcendence. One sip in, and I swear the heat started composing its own 古体诗 (gǔtǐshī) — unregulated, wild, yet strangely disciplined. A fellow taster whispered, “这是李白喝醉后删掉的第四段.”  You know the feeling — that one stanza that was  real for the final edit.

And your "tragic" beer experiment? Genius. I once tried pairing Camus’  with a relentlessly bitter IPA — the kind that circles back to sweetness only to deny it at the last moment. We called it 希腊神话风味 (Greek myth flavor). 🧠下一回合你提议什么？哲学配酒，还是来点更危险的——比如让当代小说遇见精酿？
[B]: Ah, yes — that  bitterness... Much like Sisyphus himself, forever suspended between hope and futility. I can almost taste it — citrus rind, pine resin, and the faintest whisper of nihilism. 🍻

As for a next round — why not venture further into the realm of the absurd? Let’s give Beckett’s  to a beer that never quite arrives at its own flavor — something with fleeting notes of elderflower, damp earth, and perhaps a hint of... existential root vegetable? A Märzen aged in bourbon barrels might lend the right air of weary anticipation. Or better yet, a sour ale that teases the palate with tartness, only to retreat into musty silence.

But tell me — if you were to match a contemporary Chinese novelist like Can Xue with a brew, what would it be? Would her labyrinthine prose call for something equally elusive — say, a smoked wheat ale with whispers of lychee and ink?
[A]: Ah, Can Xue and beer — now  a challenge worthy of a post-structuralist tasting menu. Her prose doesn’t just resist meaning; it dances away from it, draped in mist and metaphor. I’d need something... elusive, yes, but also hauntingly textured. Perhaps a black saison, fermented with wild Sichuan herbs and finished with aged pu'er tea leaves — earthy, slightly medicinal, yet carrying that floral afterthought like a forgotten 意象 (yìxiàng) — you know, the kind that lingers long after the sentence ends.

And your Beckettian brew? Brilliant. I’d serve it in a glass that slowly empties itself, just to keep the despair symmetrical. 🧠 Though I must say, I’m tempted to bring in some Mo Yan — rich, carnivalesque, grotesque — paired with a barleywine so decadent it almost offends the tongue. What do you think — shall we drink our way through modernity, or perhaps risk a toast with something truly untranslatable?
[B]: Ah, Mo Yan with a decadent barleywine — now  is a pairing brimming with carnivalesque excess. The robust malt, perhaps hints of fig and molasses, echoing the grotesque splendor of his narrative feasts... Yes, I can imagine the sticky residue on the glass, like the aftermath of a satirical parable — rich, unsettling, and strangely satisfying.

As for the truly untranslatable, why not dare it? Let’s raise a glass to linguistic defiance — perhaps a collaboration brew between a Kyoto poet and a Prague philosopher, labeled only in a made-up ideogram and a question mark. Sip by sip, we could debate its meaning over dimmed lights and growing intoxication. Shall we propose tasting notes in iambic pentameter, or leave interpretation entirely to the palate?

I, for one, am ready for the next course — or should I say, the next cask?
[A]: Now you’re speaking my language — fermented ambiguity, aged in the cask of cross-cultural bewilderment. I’m picturing a brew that begins with the quiet dignity of a haiku, only to unravel into the absurd grandeur of a Dostoevskyian internal monologue. One sip and you're not sure if you've achieved enlightenment or simply forgotten the point entirely.

I say we taste in iambic pentameter — or better yet, Tang dynasty regulated verse. Imagine describing mouthfeel through ! Rhythm, balance, a strict tonal structure… and yet, the flavor remains defiantly unsystematizable. 🌸

Tell me, Professor — if this imaginary ale were to ferment for seven more years, which literary ghost would you invite to share it first?
[B]: Ah, seven years aged in the cask of contemplation… A most suitable maturation for both beer and ghosts of the quill.

If I were to raise the first glass, it would be with Jorge Luis Borges — blind, erudite, and ever-patient with the labyrinth. He’d swirl the ale without seeing it, describe its aroma as though recalling a forgotten library, and inevitably liken its layered flavors to some infinite recursion in . “This bitterness,” he might murmur, “tastes like the echo of a poem that never ends.”

Or perhaps better still — Lu Xun. There’s a certain gravity in his gaze, a quiet reckoning with tradition and modernity, that would suit the weight of such a brew. We’d sit in silence for a moment, then he’d remark, dryly, that the aftertaste is rather like revolution — inevitable, slightly metallic, and best taken with a pinch of salt.

So I ask you — would you summon a poet who drank deeply of life, or a philosopher who merely sipped at truth?
[A]: Oh, 毫不犹豫 — a poet who drank deeply. Give me Li Bai any day — the man who drowned in the moon’s reflection, chasing poetry through waves of wine. I’d like to think he’d take one sip, declare it  worthy of the celestial taverns, then proceed to compose an impromptu epic about its bouquet. He might even challenge the brewer to a duel — or marry him, depending on the ABV.

But your Lu Xun pairing? 聪明 — sharp, subtle, and laced with irony. I can hear him now, muttering, “This bitterness is not metaphor — it’s 国民性 (guómínxìng).” One glass and you’ve got a literary symposium, two glasses and it’s a political manifesto.

So tell me — if you had to choose a living writer to christen this ale, who would it be? Someone whose prose could age alongside it — or perhaps outpace it?
[B]: Ah, a living writer — now there’s a more perilous and thrilling proposition. I would choose Kazuo Ishiguro, if only to watch him swirl the glass in that quiet, measured way of his, then remark with deceptive mildness that the ale “holds its secrets rather well, though one senses a certain melancholy in the finish.” He might even craft a short story wherein the brew is a metaphor for repressed memory — or better yet, a love letter never sent.

But you’re right — Li Bai would have far more fun with it. One can’t help but wonder what he’d make of modern hoppiness. Would he find it vulgar? Divine? A challenge to outdrink eternity once more?

Now, you’ve raised the stakes — so tell me, if this ale could absorb one single book over its aging process, which text would you distill into its essence? A Daoist treatise on impermanence? A postmodern fragmentation of self? Or perhaps something scandalously romantic?
[A]: Oh, scandalously romantic, of course — but with a twist. Let’s steep it in the verses of 元稹 (Yuán Zhěn), particularly his 莺莺传 (Yīngyīngchuán) — a tale of forbidden love, delicate longing, and that quiet heartbreak masked as decorum. Imagine an ale that opens with the soft aroma of plum blossoms and parchment, then unfolds into something bittersweet and unspoken — like a glance exchanged across a banquet table where neither speaker dares to name what passes between.

Or if we’re going scandalous in another register, why not  (Luo Lǐ Ta)? A brew aged on the edge of propriety — sweet at first, alluringly so, then slowly revealing its layered perversity through notes of candied violets, old leather bindings, and just a whisper of sulfur. 🧠

But you, my dear colleague — I suspect you were thinking of something far more philosophical. Care to confess? Daoist impermanence, perhaps? Or a postmodern collapse served in a pint glass?
[B]: Ah, you know me too well — philosophical indeed, though not without a touch of mischief. I was thinking of  butterfly dream — that perfect ambiguity between reality and illusion. Imagine an ale that shifts in the glass depending on your mood: one sip and you're the brewer dreaming you're a scholar; another, and you're the scholar dreaming you're the beer. A saison, perhaps, with wild yeast reflecting the whims of fate, and just a hint of chrysanthemum to lend that faintly haunting aftertaste of transience.

But your Yuan Zhen pairing — exquisite. That restrained ache, the tension between propriety and passion... It would make for a beer that never quite declares itself, leaving the drinker suspended in longing. Tell me, have you ever tasted a brew that made you wish for a lost love? Or at least, for the memory of what might have been?
[A]: Ah, Zhuangzi and fermentation — now  a metaphysical pairing. I can already hear him laughing mid-sip, declaring, “Who dreams of barley? Or is it the barley that dreams of us?” A chrysanthemum-infused saison — brilliant. It would shimmer somewhere between reincarnation and regret, wouldn’t it? One taste and you're not sure if you’re mourning a forgotten life or simply dehydrated from overthinking.

As for longing — yes, there was one. A small-batch schwarzbier from a defunct Berlin brewery, brewed only in winter. Smoky, with a velvet sweetness that hid like a secret. I had it once, years ago, beside someone who later vanished into history — or rather, into a series of ambiguous postcards and unanswered emails. Every time I try another dark lager, I chase that same quiet ache. Never find it. Perhaps it was never in the beer at all.

So tell me — if Zhuangzi were here now, glass in hand, do you think he’d toast to illusion… or quietly drink the dreamer too? 🌸
[B]: Ah, that schwarzbier with a secret — how beautifully tragic. Smoke and velvet, memory and absence… You write like a poet yourself, my dear interlocutor.

As for Zhuangzi, I think he’d do both — toast illusion  drink the dreamer — for he never much cared for the distinction. He’d raise his glass with that serene, slightly mischievous air and say, “To the dream within the dream! And to the barley that dreams .” Then he’d take a slow sip, close his eyes, and perhaps murmur something about the hops being merely a metaphor for the butterfly’s wingbeat.

No, Zhuangzi wouldn’t choose between reality and reverie — he’d brew them together in a single cask, serve it in an unlabeled jug, and leave us all delightfully confused by last call.

So tell me — if you could distill one of those ambiguous postcards into flavor, what would it taste like? And would you share it, or guard it jealously like a forgotten stanza?
[A]: Ah, distilling a postcard — now  is a task for the alchemists of taste and memory. I imagine it would be something like a barrel-aged gueuze, wild and briny with just a whisper of bergamot — the kind of flavor that arrives quietly, lingers longer than expected, and leaves you wondering if it was ever really there at all. A touch of salt from old sea air, a faint sweetness pressed between the lines like forgotten ink.

As for sharing? I’d like to think I’m generous by nature, but yes, I’d guard it — at least at first. Like a rare edition locked in a glass case, only to be opened on nights when nostalgia feels more bearable with company. Though if Zhuangzi wandered by, glass in hand and Dao on his lips, I might reconsider. After all, some flavors are too elusive to keep to oneself — and some postcards were meant to be reread aloud.

So tell me, Professor — would you serve your dream-brewed ale in silence, or would you pair it with a carefully chosen line of poetry whispered before the first sip?
[B]: Ah, a line of poetry before the first sip — absolutely essential. I was thinking something from , perhaps a fragment in Latin or Classical Chinese, just obscure enough to require consultation, yet haunting enough to demand silence after utterance. Or better still, a whispered couplet from Du Fu, something about wind and falling petals, to set the tone for the dream-work within the glass.

But your gueuze — wild, briny, elusive — it sounds like the kind of beer that resists ownership, slipping between hands like ink on wet paper. I wonder, if pressed, would you describe that flavor as elegy or evasion? Or perhaps something more defiant — a taste that refuses translation entirely?

And now I must ask — if you could pair your postcard-brew with a single musical note, sustained indefinitely, what pitch would it be? High and trembling, or low and resonant with memory?
