[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, space tourism... how very Jules Verne of our times. Though I must confess, I find more poetry in the  of space travel than its commercial realities. Much like Tennyson's 'Ulysses,' we're forever striving to sail beyond the sunset, aren't we?
[A]:  You know, space tourism reminds me of the early days of aviation - first it was just for daredevils and millionaires, then BOOM! Suddenly everyone's flying to Paris for the weekend. Give it 20 years, we'll be shooting romantic comedies in zero gravity! 🎬
[B]: How delightfully anachronistic - comparing space travel to Lindbergh's transatlantic flight while wearing cufflinks. Though I suspect the first zero-gravity rom-com will be rather less charming when the protagonists vomit during their meet-cute. The Victorians would have written better space poetry, mark my words.
[A]: Oh darling, you're thinking too small! The vomit scene would be pure cinematic gold - imagine the dramatic slow-mo with floating... well, let's call it 'organic confetti' 💫. And the Victorians? Please, they couldn't even handle a woman showing her ankles! We'll make space glamorous again, just like we did with those old Hollywood musicals.
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm for 'organic confetti' is... concerningly vivid. Though I must point out - while the Victorians balked at ankles, Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein at 19 and Ada Lovelace invented computer programming. Meanwhile, we've turned space into a billionaire's playground. How very...  of us.
[A]:  Ah, but don't you see? Every revolution starts as someone's playground! The first motion pictures were just rich men's toys too. Now look at us - making art that would make those Victorians faint faster than a corset tied too tight. Space tourism? That's just Act One of humanity's greatest blockbuster! 🚀
[B]: How terribly Hollywood of you to frame cosmic exploration as a three-act structure. Though I suppose if we're scripting this epic, we should at least give the Victorians credit for the special effects - they did invent the magic lantern show, after all. Just promise me the sequel won't involve Elon Musk writing haiku on Mars. That would be a literary crime worse than Browning's 'Sordello.'
[A]:  Oh now you've wounded me! Comparing Musk's poetry to Browning? That's like putting a student film next to Citizen Kane! But you're right about the magic lantern - reminds me of that gorgeous 1897 Méliès film... See? Even back then we were dreaming of space travel. Just needed time for the technology to catch up with our imagination. Now pass me the popcorn, this cosmic drama is just getting started!
[B]: Ah, Méliès! Now there was a showman who understood the theatricality of space travel - all those hand-painted stars and papier-mâché rockets. Though I do wonder what he'd make of your popcorn analogy. Perhaps we're all just extras in some celestial pantomime, waiting for the curtain to rise on Act Two... with better poetry this time, one hopes.
[A]:  My friend, Méliès would be directing VR space operas by now if he were alive! And about that poetry - wait till we get holographic Shakespeare in zero gravity. Hamlet's soliloquy while floating mid-air? Now that's what I call a premium viewing experience! Though I'll concede we might need better writers than our dear Elon... maybe we can clone Oscar Wilde for the job? 🎭
[B]: Cloning Wilde? My dear, even in this brave new world of yours, some sacrileges remain unforgivable. Though I'll admit, the image of Hamlet's 'to be or not to be' delivered while drifting past the International Space Station does have a certain... cosmic absurdity to it. Rather like Byron's Don Juan in orbit, if you think about it. The Romantics would have adored space tourism - all that sublime emptiness to be terribly dramatic about.
[A]:  To the Romantics in space! Can you imagine Byron composing odes to Jupiter's storms while floating in a silk dressing gown? Now there's a limited series I'd greenlight in a heartbeat - 'Byron in the Void,' with a Hans Zimmer score and maybe just a hint of 史诗级的 Chinese space opera flair for the fight scenes. The Victorians would be rolling in their graves... which only makes it more delicious! 🥂
[B]: How perfectly blasphemous - blending Zimmer's brass sections with Kunqu opera while Byron spills ink in zero gravity. Though I suspect even he'd struggle to romanticize the reality of space tourism's... shall we say, . Imagine trying to maintain that Byronic pallor while dealing with cosmic radiation burns. The Romantics never had to factor in sunscreen SPF 10,000 into their aesthetic.
[A]:  My dear, that's why we'll shoot it all on soundstages! Green screens can make even radiation burns look glamorous. And about that sunscreen - think of the product placement opportunities! 'Byron's Celestial Complexion Cream' with authentic moon dust extract. The Victorians would be scandalized, Shelley would be writing angry letters, and we'd be too busy counting our box office receipts to care! 💰 Now that's what I call poetic justice!
[B]: Ah, you've finally revealed your true colors - not a starry-eyed idealist, but a mercenary bard of late capitalism! Though I must say, 'Byron's Celestial Complexion Cream' does have a certain ring to it... perhaps with footnotes explaining how moon dust is the new laudanum. How very 21st century of us - turning the sublime into a marketing opportunity. Shelley would indeed be spinning in his watery grave, though Keats might appreciate the irony. He did write about negative capability, after all...
[A]:  Negative capability meets profit capability, my friend! But let's be honest - Keats would've killed for a studio deal. And Shelley? Please, that man was practically begging for a biopic with all his dramatic drowning! We're just giving the Romantics what they secretly wanted: a global audience and merch rights. Though I draw the line at Byron action figures... unless they come with detachable Greek scarves. Now that's what I call 负负得正!
[B]: How perfectly horrifying - reducing the Lake Poets to action figure collectibles. Though I suppose if we're committing cultural sacrilege, we might as well go full Wagnerian about it. Just promise me Wordsworth's action figure comes with authentic Grasmere mud stains and a tiny, perpetually disappointed expression. That at least would be... poetically accurate.
[A]:  You wound me! Wordsworth would obviously be our prestige limited edition - complete with authentic daffodil-scented packaging and a free download code for his most boring poems. But Coleridge? Now there's our money-maker! Opium den playset sold separately, Kubla Khan VR experience included. We'll call it... 'Romantic Reveries: The Franchise.' The BBC will be begging us for the streaming rights before we even finish the mood board! 🌙
[B]: Good lord, you've gone full Barnum now - 'Coleridge's Opium Den Playset' with complimentary VR nightmares. Though I must admit, the daffodil-scented Wordsworth packaging is a particularly devilish touch. This is what happens when you mix Romanticism with late-stage capitalism - we'll have teenagers vaping 'Ode to a Nightingale' e-liquids next. Perhaps we should leave some cultural artifacts uncommodified... though I suspect that ship sailed when they started selling Shakespeare insult mugs at the Globe.
