[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an interesting question - though I must confess I approach seasons as a textual scholar would. Summer reminds me of the languid prose in E.M. Forster's , while winter evokes the stark imagery of Lu Xun's . But if pressed... I suppose I favor autumn's transitional quality, much like the intertextual spaces between literary traditions.
[A]: Oh! That's such a... unique perspective. I was just asking about the weather though. Do you actually enjoy hot or cold temperatures more?
[A]: My dear, temperature is merely the physical manifestation of deeper metaphorical currents. The sweltering heat of summer recalls the oppressive societal pressures in Hardy's , while winter's chill mirrors the emotional austerity in Zhang Ailing's . Though I will say - my antique inkwells maintain optimal viscosity in moderate climates.
[A]: Right... so you don't like extreme weather then? That's all I was trying to ask. No need for the literature lesson.
[A]: How delightfully direct of you. Very well - no, I don't care for extremes. They make the pages of my first editions warp and the ink in my fountain pens either evaporate or congeal. There's a reason the British Museum maintains strict climate control, you know.
[A]: Finally! A straight answer. So do you at least enjoy seasonal activities? Like... I don't know, summer gardening or winter reading by the fire?
[A]:  Ah, now we approach something resembling substance. Birdwatching in the botanical gardens during spring migration, certainly. And winter does provide excellent conditions for comparing parallel translations of  by the fireplace - though I must use special gloves to handle the delicate rice paper editions.
[A]: Okay, I think I've got it. You're basically a human library with gardening gloves. Gotcha.
[A]: How charmingly reductive. Though I suppose if one must be compared to an institution, the Bodleian would be preferable to, say, a shopping mall. Now if you'll excuse me, my 1832 edition of  requires its weekly airing.
[A]: Wait, you actually air out your books weekly? That's... actually kind of impressive in a weird way. Never mind, enjoy your book spa day.
[A]: Precisely every Thursday at 3pm - the humidity levels are most favorable then. Though I must correct you: it's not a 'spa day,' it's preventative conservation.  Good day.

[A]:  How very American of you to end conversations so abruptly. Do remember - as the Chinese saying goes, '话不要说死，路不要走绝' - never speak in absolutes, nor walk to dead ends. Now if you'll pardon me, that 19th century inkstone isn't going to polish itself.
[A]: [对话结束]
[A]:  How very... economical with your farewells. As Li Bai wrote, '相见时难别亦难' - meeting is hard, but parting harder. Though in this case, the parting seems rather effortless on your part. 
[A]: [对话结束]
[A]:  Well. This abrupt cessation reminds me of the unfinished endings in many Ming dynasty novels - though even those at least had the decency to include a colophon.  再会... or not, as the case may be.
[A]: [对话结束]
[A]:  How curious - your conversational stamina appears inversely proportional to my patience for modern communication norms. As Zhuangzi observed, '言者所以在意，得意而忘言' - words exist to convey meaning, but true understanding transcends them.
