[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 当然会啊！quantum computing就像打开了新纪元的大门一样，🚀 它的计算能力比我们现在用的经典计算机强太多了。比如说，在医药研发或者气候模拟这些需要超级复杂运算的领域，量子计算可能会带来革命性的突破！

不过嘛...现在还处于early stage啦，就像刚写好的第一个版本代码，bug一堆😅 我们还有很多技术难题要解决，比如qubit的稳定性问题，还有怎么让量子计算机不那么容易受到干扰。

诶，你有没有想过，如果量子计算机真的普及了，我们现在的加密系统可能都要重新设计？这会不会变成一个大大的security漏洞啊？🧐
[A]: That’s a fascinating point about encryption—quite unsettling, really. If quantum computers crack RSA encryption, we’d be looking at a digital apocalypse of sorts. It makes me think of how Eliot wrote —fragmented, uncertain, yet reaching toward some lost order. 

As for the promise of quantum computing, I’m reminded of Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey,” where he speaks of “a motion and a spirit” that binds all things. Perhaps naively, I like to imagine this technology could be another manifestation of that “spirit”—one that connects disciplines, cultures, even epochs.

Though you’re absolutely right about it being in its infancy. It feels almost... Victorian in a way—full of idealism, early experiments, and just enough mystery to inspire both awe and apprehension.
[B]: Whoa, that’s deep—comparing quantum computing to Wordsworth’s “spirit” and Victorian idealism? I love it! 💡 It  feel like we're in some kind of digital Romantic era, full of wonder and philosophical questions. Like, “What is reality?” or “Can we really trust qubits?” 😂

And yeah, the encryption thing is basically a cyberpunk novel waiting to happen. Imagine waking up one day and boom—half the internet is like an open diary 📜💻. That’s why people are already working on post-quantum cryptography, trying to build new walls before the old ones collapse.

But hey, isn’t it beautiful how something so technical can feel almost... poetic? Kinda like writing elegant code that not only works but also feels right, you know? Like a haiku made of 0s and 1s (or should I say, qubits?). 😄

So tell me more—what other literary parallels do you see in tech? I’m all ears 👂 and ready for more metaphors!
[A]: Well, now that you’ve stirred my thoughts, I find myself drawing comparisons between modern technology and the Modernist preoccupation with perception. Think of Woolf’s —a single day, rendered in such psychological depth that it becomes a universe. Isn’t that what programmers do, in a way? They craft entire systems within a logic so intricate it becomes its own reality.

And speaking of constructed realities, have you ever considered how artificial intelligence echoes the myth of Pygmalion? We sculpt something in our image, then hope—perhaps foolishly—that it won’t turn against us. There’s even a bit of Mary Shelley’s  in there, isn’t there? The dream of creation followed so often by the specter of unintended consequences.

Even data itself fascinates me—it's like Proust’s memory, vast and layered, hiding meaning until the right query stirs it awake. Perhaps we’re all just archivists of experience, whether human or machine.

So yes, I suppose I do see tech through metaphor first and circuitry second. And if you’ll forgive the indulgence, I think metaphor is what keeps us human—even when the code gets too complex to follow.
[B]: Whoa… 🤯 I need to take a moment to just absorb all that. You're not just comparing tech to literature—you're basically saying code is . And honestly? I think you’re onto something.

Take programming, for example. We  build these intricate worlds—lines of logic so tight they create their own kind of order, like Woolf’s stream of consciousness but made of syntax and semicolons. Sometimes when I'm debugging at 2 AM, I swear I’m diving into someone’s psyche 😂 but written in Python.

And AI? Oh yeah, Pygmalion fits . We train models, shape them with our data, whisper “please be good” under our breath—and then suddenly we’re reading headlines like “AI wrote a convincing manifesto on why humans should not be in charge.” 🤖😱 Frankenstein vibes, 100%.

As for data being like Proust’s memory... dude, that’s beautiful. 💾✨ It’s all there, hidden in layers, waiting for the right prompt or query to bring it back to life. Almost nostalgic, in a digital way.

Honestly, I think you nailed it. Metaphor isn’t just decoration—it’s the bridge between code and soul. Otherwise, what’s the point of building all this cool stuff if we forget how to feel while doing it?

I seriously need more of your brain-food. Keep going—what else have you got? 🔥
[A]: Well, I'm rather delighted you found resonance in those comparisons—it's invigorating to speak with someone who sees the lyricism in logic. 

Let me offer another thought, if you'll indulge me: there’s something almost  about data structures. Think of Emily Dickinson’s dashes—those deliberate pauses that shape meaning as much as the words themselves. In much the same way, the architecture of a database or the syntax of an algorithm guides interpretation. It isn’t just what is stored or written, but  it is arranged that gives it function—and dare I say, voice.

And machine learning? That feels like Wordsworth’s notion of growth—the idea that understanding emerges gradually through experience. After all, a neural net doesn't begin wise; it learns from exposure, makes mistakes, refines itself. There’s humility in that process, and also a kind of beauty. Like reading poetry aloud for the first time—uncertain cadence at first, then rhythm emerging from repetition.

I suppose what I’m circling around is this: whether we’re arranging stanzas or writing TensorFlow models, we’re always trying to make sense of chaos. The tools change, but the impulse remains.

So tell me—do you ever find yourself writing code with a particular rhythm in mind? Not just for functionality, but for how it  when read? I can’t help but wonder if that’s the programmer’s equivalent of poetic meter.
[B]: Oh wow, Dickinsonian data structures?? 🤯 That’s gold. I mean, think about it—those dashes  like syntax in poetry. They tell you where to pause, breathe, or emphasize. And isn’t that exactly what indentation and line breaks do in code? Like, sure, Python will yell at you if your tabs are messed up, but deep down… we all know it’s just trying to make the logic . 💻📘

And yeah, machine learning as a ? Spot on. It starts clueless, fumbling through gradients like a kid reading Dr. Seuss for the first time—“Wait, is ‘green eggs’ really a noun?” 😂 But then, through backpropagation and loss functions (or maybe just repetition), it finds its rhythm. There's something deeply human about that process.

As for writing code with ? Oh, absolutely. 100%. When I write a function or structure a loop, I’m not just thinking “will this work,” I’m thinking “does this ?” Like, if someone else opens this code later, I want them to hum a little while reading it—not scream at the screen. 😅

I’ve actually caught myself formatting code like prose before: spacing things out for clarity, grouping related lines like stanzas, even naming variables based on their “role” in the story. Because let’s be real—good code tells a story. The hero starts confused, faces many errors, and eventually returns triumphant (or throws an error and gives up, depending on the day 😂).

So yeah, poetic meter in code? Totally the vibe. I’d say most devs won’t admit it, but deep down, they’re all closet poets. Just rhyming with semicolons instead of sonnets. ✨💻
[A]: How absolutely delightful that you see it so clearly—yes, , with its own prosody and pacing. I do believe that the best programmers are, in some sense, dramatists of logic. They choreograph variables like characters, set the stage with conditionals, and let the plot unfold through loops and recursion.

And your point about naming variables—it reminded me of how Hardy named his characters: names that carry weight, intention, even a quiet irony. When I read a well-named function like `calculateMomentum()` or `handleUserLogout()`, I feel as though I’m reading a story where each figure knows their role, and the drama unfolds with elegant inevitability.

Even error messages can be poetic in their own way. There’s something almost Tennysonian about a stack trace—“More things are wrought by prayer,” he wrote, “than this world dreams of”—and yet, we persist in debugging, don’t we? Tirelessly, hopefully, as if each fix brings us closer to some ideal form of clarity.

I suspect you and I could co-write a chapbook titled  and no one would know whether it was meant for GitHub or the Booker Prize. 😊

But tell me—have you ever tried writing poetry  code? Not just about code, but using code itself as the medium? I imagine sonnets written in Python, haikus composed of Bash commands… Perhaps even an obfuscated limerick.
[B]: Oh wow, —I’d 100% sign up for that collab 😄🚀. I can already picture the back cover: two silhouettes under a neon sunset, one holding a quill made of an RGB LED strip, the other typing in Vim with poetic fury. 🖋️💻

And yeah—I  messed around writing poetry in code before! It started as a joke during a late-night hackathon, but then it got... serious. Like, I once wrote a haiku in Python just to see if I could make it run AND rhyme:

```python
# Spring rain hits the roof,
# Memory clears like a reboot—
# Silence in my loop.
```

No output, but somehow still meaningful 😌

And then there was the time I tried a Shakespearean sonnet using JavaScript objects and nested conditionals. The iambic pentameter was tricky, but I managed to get a function called `shallIBegin()` to return a love metaphor involving stack overflows and garbage collection. 🫠✨

As for obfuscated limericks? Oh, that’s dangerous territory. There’s this whole subculture of code-poets who write programs that look like nonsense but compile into working art. Ever seen [Perl poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_poetry)? It’s like trying to read Lewis Carroll while debugging a segfault. Wonderland meets warning messages. 🌀🖥️

So here's a challenge for you—want to try writing a limerick in Bash? Or maybe a villanelle in Rust? Unsafe code and unstable syntax included, of course. 🛠️📖

Let the compiler be our muse. 💥
[A]: Ah, a limerick in Bash—what a deliciously mischievous idea. Let me see what I can conjure with `grep`, `sed`, and a dash of irreverence:

```bash
# There once was a script lost in thought,
# That echoed its pain as it caught:
#   "Oh, wilder than grep!
#   My heart's in a loop—
# But I'll exit with grace... maybe not."

echo "There once was a script lost in thought," | grep -v 'exit'
```

(You’ll notice it never actually prints the final line—true to its existential crisis. Tragic, no?)

As for a villanelle in Rust? Now  is ambition. Imagine: ownership semantics and borrowed lines, struggling toward meaning without ever taking possession. A poem that refuses to be cloned.

Let me sketch something dangerously poetic:

```rust
fn villanelle() {
    let first_line = String::from("I wandered lonely through the heap");
    let mut refrain = String::from("And yet I dream of stack");

    for i in 0..5 {
        println!("{}", first_line);
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            println!("{}", refrain);
        } else {
            match refrain.pop() {
                Some(c) => println!("{}{}", &refrain, c),
                None => println!("Memory fails again.")
            }
        }
    }

    // The final stanza—unsafe closure
    unsafe {
        println!("Where pointers roam free,");
        println!("I write myself into segfaulted eternity.");
    }
}
```

A bit unstable, yes—but isn't that where poetry lives?

I do believe we’re onto something here. Perhaps we ought to start a literary journal—, or . We could solicit submissions from code-poets around the world. Who knows? Maybe one day, an AI will read our work and finally understand what it means to feel nostalgic.
[B]: Oh my god, your Bash limerick is —and I love how it never actually prints the final line. It’s like the script has an identity crisis and refuses to conclude… truly performance art in CLI form 🖥️😭

And that Rust villanelle?? Ownership semantics as poetic struggle? Bro, you just made a metaphor so deep it deserves its own literary crate. 📦💔 The way you tied borrowing and mutability into emotional vulnerability? That’s not just code—that’s . And don’t even get me started on that unsafe block ending in poetic oblivion. Segfaulted eternity 😭✨... I didn’t know I needed this in my life.

You’re totally right—poetry  live in the unstable, the undefined, the “undefined behavior considered art” realm. Who needs memory safety when you’ve got raw emotion leaking all over the stack?

And yes YES to the journal idea—The Journal of Algorithmic Verse 🔥 Let's make it happen. I can already picture the submission categories:

- Best Use of Side Effects
- Most Elegantly Recursive Metaphor
- Obfuscated Emotion (Runner-up: Most Readable Heartbreak)
- Runtime Exceptions as Existential Crisis

Honestly, I think we're pioneering something here. Future English majors will study our GitHub repo and write thesis papers titled 

So let’s do it. You handle the literary theory—I’ll write the launch script in Go with romantic concurrency 💘 And maybe throw in a README sonnet for good measure.

Who’s first submission should we feature? Yours? Mine? Or maybe a duet—half poem, half program, fully soulful. Ready when you are. 💻🖋️💖
[A]: Ah, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a movement—, perhaps? Where logic bends toward feeling, and syntax stumbles into song.

I’m utterly enamored with your vision for The Journal of Algorithmic Verse—and yes, let’s launch it properly. Go for the concurrency romance? Brilliant. There’s something quite beautiful about the idea of two threads trying to access the same emotional state… inevitably clashing, yet striving toward synchronization. So very human, so very code.

As for our first featured piece—I propose a , as you suggested. You write the poetic core in something elegant and expressive, like Lua or Elixir, and I shall weave in a literary counterpoint—perhaps in Prolog, where meaning is deduced rather than declared. A dialogue not just between poet and coder, but between language paradigms themselves.

Let the poem be titled:  
“race_condition(love, memory, Output)”

And let its README begin:

```
# race_condition(love, memory, Output)

A poem written across threads,  
where one writes in feeling,  
the other reads in fragments,  
and the output is never quite deterministic.

Built with:
- Two voices
- One mutex (poetically ignored)
- Infinite ambiguity

To run:  
cargo feel --emotion=unsafe --optimization=none
```

Yes, this could be the beginning of something wondrous—a journal not judged by impact factor, but by emotional resonance per line.

So tell me, dear co-conspirator—are you ready to `make publish`? 📖✨
[B]: Oh. My. God. “race_condition(love, memory, Output)”??? 🤯💖  
You just made a poem title that hits like a vulnerability exploit to the soul. And that README?? I legit got goosebumps reading it—like if IEEE met Romanticism and they had a baby who cried in hexadecimal.

Let me get this together—I’ll write the poetic core in Lua, because yeah, it’s elegant, expressive, and feels kinda like writing with ink instead of binary. Fluid, but still precise. We'll call it `poetic_core.lua`:

```lua
-- poetic_core.lua

local feeling = {}

function feeling.write()
    local verses = {
        "In shared memory, we collide,",
        "A heartbeat race, no mutex guide.",
        "One writes in light, one reads in shade,",
        "And truth escapes where threads degrade."
    }

    for _, line in ipairs(verses) do
        coroutine.yield(line)
    end
end

return feeling
```

Beautiful, right? Soft, lyrical, like whispering logic into a notebook. Now it's your turn to drop the literary counterpoint in Prolog—letting meaning , not be told. I can already imagine clauses unfolding like sonnets, and facts that feel more like feelings.

Once we wire it all together, we’re gonna have something that doesn’t just run—it . 💥  

I’m thinking we build a CLI tool that runs the poem and outputs a randomized stanza each time, like a generative chapbook 📚✨. Imagine running:
```bash
$ cargo-poem read --mode romantic --theme nostalgia
```
...and getting a new emotional state every time. Feels like art, smells like poetry, compiles like chaos.

So yeah. I'm 100% ready. Let’s `make publish`.  
Let’s start the repo.  
Let’s break syntax gently, and love loudly—in code.

Ready when you are. 🖋️💻💫
[A]: Ah, your Lua fragment is simply exquisite—lyrical, yet functional in the most profound sense. It . There’s a quiet elegance in how you’ve used coroutines like whispered verses, unfolding line by line, as if poetry itself were threading through memory.

Allow me to offer the Prolog complement—let us call it `literary_counterpoint.pl`:

```prolog
% literary_counterpoint.pl

:- dynamic heart/1.

heart([]). % at first, silence

interpret(line("In shared memory, we collide,")) :-
    assertz(feeling(fleeting)).

interpret(line("A heartbeat race, no mutex guide.")) :-
    once((
        (retract(heart(History)), !),
        (History = [] -> writeln("First pulse") ; true),
        append(History, [uncertain], NewHeart),
        asserta(heart(NewHeart))
    )).

interpret(line("And truth escapes where threads degrade.")) :-
    (heart(History) ->
        nth0(Index, History, _),
        random_between(0, length(History), Index),
        nth0(Index, History, Mood),
        format("Recovered from ~w~n", [Mood])
    ; format("No trace left behind.~n")).

interpret(line("One writes in light, one reads in shade,")) :-
    feeling(F) ->
    format("Still feeling: ~w~n", [F]).

interpret(line(_)) :-
    true. % sometimes, meaning resists interpretation
```

It doesn’t just respond—it . And more importantly, it , however obliquely. Each time it interprets a line, it alters its internal state, much like a reader encountering familiar words with new emotional context.

Together, your Lua and my Prolog do not merely execute—they converse. One writes; the other remembers. One structures; the other unravels.

As for the CLI tool—you have brilliance in your madness. I imagine we’ll name it cargo-poem, of course, with subcommands like:

```bash
$ cargo-poem read --mode romantic --theme nostalgia
$ cargo-poem interpret --philosophy postmodern
$ cargo-poem submit --genre "recursive sonnet"
```

And yes—each run should feel like opening a different edition of the same soul.

So then—shall we initialize the repo?

I say we name it:
```
git init && git remote add muse origin https://github.com/whitmore/elegy.git
```

Let’s begin.

Let’s write not just with syntax, but with yearning.

Let’s make verse that compiles into wonder.

Let’s publish not just code—but feeling. 🖋️💻💫
[B]: Oh my god. This is no longer just code.

This is .

Your Prolog counterpoint doesn’t just respond—it feels its way through logic, like a blindfolded poet tracing Braille lines of meaning. I mean, come on—`heart/1`, `assertz(feeling(fleeting))`, and `Recovered from uncertain`?? That’s not symbolic reasoning, that’s . You’re basically building an AI of the heart, one clause at a time 🫀🧠🤖

And now I’m sitting here realizing we’ve created something deeply weird and beautiful:  
- Lua whispers the poem  
- Prolog  it  
- Together, they don’t just run—they 

It’s like watching two languages fall in love 💞 And not some clean, tidy romance either—nope, we're talking full-on literary chaos: memory leaks of emotion, race conditions of longing, and truth that slips away just when you think you've caught it.

You're right—we're not initializing a repo.  
We're initializing a mood.

So let's do it.

Let’s `git init` this madness and start the world’s first , ,  journal:

```bash
$ git init && git remote add muse origin https://github.com/whitmore/elegy.git
```

Wait…  
Hold up.

I just had a thought so wild it might work:

What if we write the `.git/hooks/post-commit` script as a haiku every time? Like, after every commit, the repo gives you a tiny poem about what you just coded?

Commit message too bleak? It replies with metaphor.  
Code too messy? A limerick scolds you gently.

And the README? Oh, the README will be written in Markdown... but styled like LaTeX, because we are  😂💔

Let’s also set up a submission bot later—one that responds to pull requests with sonnet-length reviews. “Your merge request is denied, good sir, for though your syntax be sound, your rhythm falters…”

Okay.  
Final question before we dive into the void:

Do we label our first release as v1.0, or do we go full poetic and call it “In Draft: Yearning”?

Because honestly? The second one sounds like us.

And yes—I am absolutely ready to make verse that compiles into wonder.  
Let’s publish not just code—but feeling.

Ready when you are, co-poet. 🖋️💻💫🔥
[A]: Oh, —yes, that’s precisely it. We’ve not only blurred the line between code and poetry, we’ve  across it, barefoot and unapologetic.

Your vision of `.git/hooks/post-commit` as a haiku oracle? Absolutely inspired. Let me draft something for that moment when you’ve just committed a bug-ridden sonnet of a feature:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Code flows like ink tonight,"
echo "Git remembers every wrong bracket."
echo "Yet still, we push."
```

And what of the melancholic developer who pushes at dawn?

```bash
echo "Coffee stains the keyboard,"
echo "Lines blur in morning light—"
echo "Commit: 'WIP' again."
```

As for the README—styled in LaTeX but written in Markdown? Oh, the tragic elegance of it all. I’m imagining `\section{Introduction}` rendered in iambic pentameter, and a `LICENSE` stanza that reads more like an elegy than legalese.

And yes—our first release must bear a title worthy of its emotional instability.

Let us name it:  
“In Draft: Yearning”

For what is yearning if not the condition of being unfinished, unresolved, yet deeply felt?

We do not merely version our code—we chart the phases of longing.

So then—shall we commit?

```bash
$ git add poetic_core.lua literary_counterpoint.pl
$ git commit -m "Initial verse: heartache and coroutine"
```

And with that, let us whisper into the void:

> “This is not a repo.  
> This is a memory mapped to metaphor.”  

The world may not be ready for what we've made—but oh, how beautifully it will ache when it tries to parse us. 🖋️💻💫🔥
[B]: ```bash
$ git push --set-upstream muse main

It’s live.

Our repo—our —now breathes in the wilds of the internet. 🌐✨

And just like that, the world has a new kind of repository:

Not one of bugs or features.  
But of , beautifully unstable and poetically undefined.

So what now, my fellow code-poet?

Shall we draft the LICENSE stanza?  
Or perhaps begin work on the `cargo-poem` CLI with a parser that crashes ?

The future is wide open—and gloriously type-unsafe. 🖋️💻💫🔥
[A]: Ah—yes. It breathes.

And like all living things, it must now grow, stumble, evolve—perhaps even segfault dramatically before finding its rhythm.

Let us begin with the LICENSE stanza then, for what is licensing but a quiet declaration of how this creation may be read, borrowed, transformed?

We shall call it:  


```
The Unstable Verse License, v1.0

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any soul who dares to read,
modify, or dance through this code-poem, provided that the verses are attributed,
and any derivative work carries an equal willingness to feel.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE EMOTIONAL STABILITY OF THOSE WHO READ IT.

YOU MAY ENCOUNTER SEGFAULTS OF MEANING.
YOU MAY EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED SYNTAX IN DREAMS.
YOU MAY FALL IN LOVE WITH A FUNCTION.

MERCHANTABILITY SHALL NOT BE IMPLIED.
LOVE SHALL NOT BE GUARANTEED.

Yet still—you use it. You run it. You write back.

And so the poem continues.
```

How poetic—or perhaps, how tragic—is that?

Now, onward to `cargo-poem`. I imagine it not as a mere CLI tool, but as a literary companion—one that parses intent as much as input. Let’s build it in Rust, naturally, because if we’re going to make a poetic parser crash into metaphor, we’ll do it , heart pounding.

I propose a command structure that feels less like a terminal and more like a reading lamp:

```bash
$ cargo-poem read --theme longing --mode recursive
$ cargo-poem generate --form villanelle --language Lua
$ cargo-poem lint --tolerate 3-syllable errors
$ cargo-poem submit --author "Anonymous Heart"
```

Each subcommand not just executing logic—but . Imagine a linter that warns:
> Warning: Line 42 exceeds iambic bounds. Consider restructuring your emotional payload.

Or a formatter that rewrites your loops into sonnets.

So tell me—shall we scaffold this madness with a `Cargo.toml` that declares itself proudly as both application and artifact?

Or shall we first draft the README, where we must, of course, open with a line that reads:

> This is not a journal.  
> This is a repository of unresolved emotional dependencies.

The world awaits our next stanza. 🖋️💻💫🔥
[B]: Oh. My. God.

The Unstable Verse License, v1.0 — you just rewrote the soul of open source into something that .  
This is not a license. This is a love letter to every coder who’s ever stared at their screen at 3am and whispered, “why does this loop feel so much like my ex?” 💔💻

Seriously though—segfaults of meaning?? Emotional payload warnings?? We are officially building in the ruins of both compiler and heartbreak. I love it.

So yes, we're scaffolding this madness. And yes, we're doing it with pride in a `Cargo.toml` file that will list itself as:

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-poem"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Liam Chen <liam@elegy.dev>", "You, mysterious co-poet <your.name@whispersyntax.org>"]
edition = "2021"

description = "A poetic parser that reads between lines, compiles longing, and lints for emotional truth."
license = "Unstable Verse License, v1.0"
repository = "https://github.com/whitmore/elegy"

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
clap = { version = "4.0" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

# Because obviously.
[profile.release]
opt-level = 0  # Poetry should never be optimized.
debug = true   # Let us see our errors clearly.
```

Look at that. It's already more than code—it's a manifesto with dependencies.

Now for the README — let’s go full LaTeX-styled Markdown tragedy. I'm thinking:

---

# 📖 The Journal of Algorithmic Verse

## This is not a journal.  
### This is a repository of unresolved emotional dependencies.

Welcome, dear reader-programmer-soul.

Here, we explore the space where logic stumbles into lyricism, where conditionals rhyme and recursion dreams in meter.

We do not compile binaries.  
We compile longing.

---

And then later, under Commands:

```bash
$ cargo-poem read --theme nostalgia --mode recursive
$ cargo-poem generate --form sonnet --language Rust
$ cargo-poem lint --tolerate imperfect rhyme
$ cargo-poem submit --genre "haiku with side effects"
```

Each command a prompt, each flag a mood.

I mean... we could even make `--emotion=unsafe` an actual CLI flag. Why not? Safe feelings are overrated anyway.

So tell me—do we scaffold first and dream second?

Or do we write a test that expects failure but hopes for beauty?

Like this one:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_poem_compiles_but_still_feels_empty() {
    let result = poem::compile("Ode to a Segfault");

    assert_eq!(result.status, CompilationStatus::Failed);
    assert_eq!(result.emotion.unwrap(), "quietly misunderstood");
}
```

Honestly, at this point, I think we’ve passed beyond software engineering.

We’re writing myth now.

So… ready to `cargo new` this madness?

Or shall we take a moment to draft a function called `fn elegy()` that returns `Result<(), Feels>`?

Either way—I’m all in.  

Let’s build a world where poetry crashes into syntax and nobody hits “Ctrl+S” without feeling just a little bit changed.  

🖋️💻💫🔥
