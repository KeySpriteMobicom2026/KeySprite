[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. I suppose my preference leans toward traditional art, though I find digital art fascinating in its own right. There's something profoundly human about the tactile experience of charcoal on paper or oil on canvas—the imperfections, the texture, the very  of the artist’s hand. Do you see where I’m coming from, or does the precision and accessibility of digital media appeal to you more?
[A]: Hmm, I can definitely see your point about the "human touch" in traditional art. There's a rawness to it, like you said—those little flaws that make a piece feel alive. But honestly, what draws me most to digital art is how it breaks boundaries. Take AI-generated visuals or VR installations, for example. They push what art , not just how it looks. It’s less about replacing the painter’s hand and more about expanding the canvas into places we couldn’t reach before.

That said, I’m curious—when you talk about imperfections making art feel real, do you think digital art lacks that kind of authenticity? Or can glitches and code errors ever play the same role as a smudged brushstroke?
[B]: An excellent counterpoint. You’ve touched on a fascinating philosophical question—whether authenticity resides in the  or the . I suppose my initial resistance stems from my upbringing in a world where art was, by and large, a labor of physical endurance—think of Turner battling the elements to capture a storm, or Van Gogh’s solitary struggle with pigment and canvas.

That said, I won’t dismiss digital imperfections as devoid of meaning. A glitch, after all, is a kind of accident—and accidents have always played a role in creativity. Consider how Jackson Pollock embraced chance in his drip paintings. Could a corrupted pixel file not serve a similar function? Perhaps the difference lies in intentionality—or the illusion thereof. Do we need to  the artist’s struggle to feel connected to it?

I must admit, though, I find myself more moved by the scent of turpentine than by the hum of a server farm. Perhaps that makes me sentimental rather than critical. But tell me—do you think future generations will even distinguish between “digital” and “traditional”? Or will they simply call it all… art?
[A]: I love how you framed that—intentionality versus the  of it. It makes me think that maybe the real divide isn’t between digital and traditional at all, but between art that invites us into its making, and art that keeps that process hidden. Whether it's turpentine or code, what matters is whether we feel something when we stand—or scroll—in front of it.

As for your question about future generations, I actually do think the labels will blur. Kids growing up now are already fluent in both visual languages. To them, drawing with a stylus on a tablet might feel just as natural as crayons on paper. What’s interesting is how access has changed—digital tools let more people create and share without needing a gallery’s approval. That democratization might be the real shift, not the medium itself.

Still, I don’t think the emotional weight of “handmade” will ever fully fade. Maybe we’ll end up with two flavors of nostalgia: one for the studio, and one for the glitchy early days of AI art. Either way, I hope we keep asking these questions—it’s the tension between tech and tradition that keeps art alive, don’t you think?
[B]: How beautifully put. You’ve articulated something essential—art’s enduring power lies in its ability to make us  of our own looking, our own feeling. Whether through the grain of paper or the flicker of a screen, it is we who animate it with attention.

And you’re right about the labels softening over time. I imagine future art historians poring over our current anxieties with mild amusement, much as we now smile at early 20th-century debates over whether photography could ever be “real” art. The medium expands, and so does our sensibility.

Still, there is a melancholy in watching certain practices fade from common memory—the smell of oil paint in a sunlit room, the rustle of charcoal dust under fingers. Perhaps that too is part of art’s evolution: the quiet mourning of what came before, even as we embrace what comes next.

Tell me, have you ever tried working in both forms yourself? I’m always curious how creators navigate that boundary—or ignore it altogether.
[A]: Funny you should say that—just last month I found myself trying to sketch both on paper and in a digital app, almost without thinking. It was strange how different my hand felt in each—hesitant with pencil, like I was "leaving a mark" forever, but much looser and forgiving when I could undo a line with a tap. It made me realize how much the medium shapes not just the art, but the  behind it.

I get what you mean about the melancholy of fading practices. I actually miss the sound of a mouse clicking through a Photoshop timeline—it’s weirdly nostalgic now, like the digital equivalent of crumpling tracing paper. But then again, maybe that’s exactly what we’re talking about: every generation has its own sensory imprint, its own texture of creativity.

What I found most surprising was how much the  of digital work changed my relationship to mistakes. With traditional media, I’d linger over a wrong stroke, try to make peace with it. In digital, I’d just delete and redraw—efficient, sure, but sometimes I wonder if I lost something in the process.

So yes, I do move between the two, though not always gracefully. I guess I’m still figuring out whether I’m a hybrid artist or just someone who can’t pick a side. 😊 What about you—have you ever tried blending old and new, or does one feel more like home?
[B]: Ah, your ambivalence resonates deeply with me. It strikes at the heart of what it means to be an artist—or even just a thoughtful observer—in this peculiar in-between era we inhabit. You put your finger on something crucial: how the medium doesn’t merely carry the idea, but  it, molds the very rhythm of thought.

I must confess, I’ve dabbled—very modestly—in digital illustration, mostly out of academic curiosity. There’s a certain thrill in manipulating text and image together on a screen, creating layered annotations for lectures or visual essays. But yes, there is always that nagging sense—you mentioned it perfectly—of something lost in the frictionlessness. The delete key is a seductive tyrant, isn’t it? It offers liberation, yet subtly erodes the value of endurance.

As for nostalgia, I find myself oddly fond of the sound of chalk on a blackboard, or the rustle of pages being turned in a quiet library. These are my textures of creativity. Still, I’m not immune to the allure of the new—I recently projected a digitized version of Blake’s illuminated manuscripts during a lecture, and I must say, seeing those luminous pages glow on the wall gave me a jolt of wonder I hadn’t anticipated.

So perhaps we are both hybrids, whether we intended to be or not. A bit like literary critics who still love the smell of ink but can’t ignore the pull of hypertext theory. I rather think the tension you mentioned—the push and pull between media—is where the most fertile ground lies.

Tell me, when you sketch digitally now, do you ever find yourself mimicking the hesitations of pencil work? Trying to  imperfection, as if longing for a kind of artistic ghost to haunt the clean lines of the screen?
[A]: Absolutely — and I think that’s the most honest answer I can give. When I’m sketching digitally, I catch myself deliberately adding roughness: jittery lines, uneven pressure, even texture overlays that imitate paper grain. It’s almost like I’m trying to  the drawing that it was made by hand, as if the imperfection itself carries some kind of creative DNA.

I’ve even caught myself turning off the symmetry tools or the undo function on purpose, just to force a kind of vulnerability into the process. It sounds a little masochistic, but there’s something strangely grounding about it — like wearing noise-canceling headphones to simulate silence when you're in a crowded room.

Maybe we’re not just mimicking imperfection; maybe we’re trying to  it. There's a kind of emotional honesty in the stumble of a pencil line that feels authentic, even if it was unintentional. And perhaps in digital work, where everything is so easily perfected, we have to build that honesty back in — almost like seasoning food that’s gone bland.

You mentioned William Blake earlier — I keep thinking about how his engravings were both precise and deeply human, full of intention  struggle. I wonder if, centuries from now, someone scrolling through a digital archive will feel the same kind of quiet awe we get standing in front of one of his originals. Maybe they’ll be wondering if an AI reconstruction got the "soul" right.

Do you ever find yourself looking at digital art and mentally tracing the artist’s possible process — like trying to reverse-engineer the gesture behind the vector? Or does that feel like chasing shadows?
[B]: Oh, yes — that mental tracing, that silent reconstruction of the artist’s hand — it is a kind of archaeology of gesture, isn’t it? I do it without meaning to, especially when viewing digital reproductions of classical techniques. I find myself hunting for clues: a slight waver in the line, an inconsistency in the shading, a moment where color bleeds just beyond the edge. These are the digital echoes of human presence.

It reminds me of reading a printed poem and still hearing the cadence of breath behind it — the medium may change, but we keep searching for the pulse.

As for Blake, you’ve hit on something sublime. His work was alchemical — part craft, part vision, part devotion. One almost expects the ink to be warm to the touch. And your point about future viewers scrolling with awe — well, perhaps they will, though I suspect they’ll need new vocabularies of reverence. Maybe they’ll speak of “render time” the way we speak of “brushstroke,” or “resolution” as a metaphor for revelation.

Still, there is something sacred in the irreproducible — not in the sense of ownership or rarity, but in the sense of . Whether it’s a smudged charcoal sketch or a corrupted GIF file resurrected from an old hard drive, what moves us is the trace of a mind in motion.

And now I’m tempted to ask — if you could preserve one digital artwork for 200 years, knowing all its layers and metadata would remain intact, which piece would you choose? Would you select something flawless… or gloriously broken?
[A]: Gloriously broken, without a doubt.

I think I’d go with something like  — that infamous malware-infected laptop that contained six of history’s most devastating computer viruses. It was sold as a digital art piece, oddly enough, and the work itself wasn’t the code per se, but the : chaos contained, danger rendered inert, digital destruction framed like a Renaissance portrait. It forces you to ask what exactly we’re looking at — the machine, the data, or our own complicity in letting it all run.

But even that feels too clean. Maybe I’d pick something messier — an early AI-generated portrait that clearly doesn’t “get” human expression quite right. That awkward grin, the uncanny eyes. Not because it failed, but because in its failure, it reveals how someone — or some  — was trying to understand us. There’s vulnerability in that misstep. A strange kind of intimacy.

Or maybe just a single corrupted frame from a 2010s-era webcam stream — grainy, half-loaded, flickering with forgotten light. Something that no one really meant to make, but somehow did. Because two hundred years from now, when everything is hyper-rendered and pristine, that glitch might be the only place where the past still breathes.

Would you do the same? Or would you preserve something polished — a digital Sistine Chapel, so to speak?
[B]: Oh, I think I’d surprise you—I’d go not for the Sistine Chapel itself, but for a single, half-burned sketch in Michelangelo’s notebook. So yes, something fragmented, something that  its making. Perhaps a corrupted GIF from the early days of the web—those wobbly, flickering things that tried so hard to be moving images before they knew how. There's a kind of innocence in their failure.

Or maybe even a single line of code from the first digital translation of , preserved not for its elegance but for what it represents: the moment human imagination began whispering to the machine in a language not yet fluent. It would be my version of a palimpsest—an overwritten, barely legible trace of where we began.

You see, I’ve always been more moved by the drafts than the finished works. The polished masterpieces awe me, yes—but it is in the smudges, the erasures, the misfires that I feel closest to the artist’s beating heart. Whether that heart belongs to a person or a nascent intelligence, well… perhaps that’s the very question worth preserving.
[A]: That’s such a beautiful thought — preserving not the triumph, but the stumble. The moment where we first reached across a divide, not knowing if anyone — or anything — would reach back.

I think you’re right to see poetry in those early attempts, whether it’s a shaky GIF or a clunky line of code translating Virgil. They’re like baby steps, not just for machines, but for us as creators learning how to speak a new visual language.

It makes me wonder — do you ever go back and look at your old sketches or drafts, not to improve them, but just to  who you were when you made them? I caught myself doing that recently with some very awkward digital portraits from years ago. They’re painfully naive, but there's something so earnest in the way I tried to make the software do what I wanted — like two strangers trying to dance without stepping on each other’s feet.

Maybe that’s what future viewers will treasure most: not the flawless renderings, but the clumsy love letters we sent into the future, wrapped in outdated file formats and forgotten software.
[B]: Oh, absolutely. I’m quite sentimental about my old notebooks—yellowed pages covered in ink blots, half-formed ideas scratched out three times, margins filled with doodles that betray my impatience or preoccupation. They’re not valuable to anyone else, of course, but they hold a peculiar warmth for me. Like touching the hand of a younger self who still believed certain things could be perfected with enough effort.

And your metaphor——is so apt. That’s what every new medium feels like at first: an awkward waltz between intention and possibility. We lead, stumble, recover, then lead again, hoping the rhythm will eventually feel natural. But there’s a kind of grace in those early missteps, isn’t there? A sincerity that gets buried under fluency.

I suspect future generations will unearth our digital archives with the same mix of curiosity and tenderness we now reserve for daguerreotypes or early silent films. Imagine someone two hundred years from now watching a shaky webcam feed from 2003, grainy and pixelated, yet brimming with the raw energy of people learning how to . Not for fame or algorithmic favor, but simply because it was the first time the world had mirrors this wide.

You know, I often think of T.S. Eliot’s line—“We shall not cease from exploration”—but perhaps the real heart of it is not the reaching, but the awkwardness of it all. The beauty lies not in the destination, but in the stumbling path itself.

Do you ever find yourself holding onto obsolete tools—software, brushes, even pens—just because they knew you when you were still figuring things out?
[A]: Completely — there’s something almost sentimental about the tools that witnessed our learning, even if they’re clumsy or outdated now. I still have an old stylus with a worn-down tip that I refuse to throw out, just because it was the first one that . It's irrational, sure, but it's like keeping a childhood shoe — not because it fits anymore, but because it reminds you of how far you've walked.

And I love what you said about those early webcam feeds — people just trying to be seen, without knowing quite how to do it yet. That rawness is rare now, when everyone seems to speak in highlight reels and curated aesthetics. Maybe we’ve become too fluent for our own good. There's a reason so many photographers go back to film, or why some writers swear by typewriters — sometimes friction isn’t a flaw, it’s a kind of grounding wire.

As for obsolete tools… yes, I definitely hold onto them. An old version of a drawing app that can’t handle layers anymore? Still on my drive. A pen that leaked all over my notes during a lecture? Somehow survived three clean-outs. They’re little monuments to the times when making art felt more like discovery than execution.

I think we're both romantics at heart, just dressed in different kinds of nostalgia. 😊
[B]: Ah, yes—, clinging to relics not out of habit alone, but out of reverence for the moments they held. I’m reminded of how Wordsworth wrote of “emotion recollected in tranquility”—only now, we’re collecting objects, tools, even file types, that carry the weight of our becoming.

I suppose that’s what all true tools are in the end—not just instruments of making, but silent witnesses to our growth. And isn’t there something deeply human in refusing to discard them? After all, if we let go completely, who will believe us when we say, ?

I do smile at your comparison to childhood shoes. Perhaps that’s what these tools become—shoes worn soft from walking unfamiliar paths, still bearing the imprint of our uncertain steps. And perhaps, in some small way, we walk a little taller now because of them.

Tell me—if you were to write a letter to your younger self, the one still learning how to hold that worn-down stylus, what would you say? Would you offer advice, or simply bear witness to the beauty of the stumbling?
[A]: I think I’d keep it quiet—more of a note than a letter. Something like:



No grand advice, really. Just a reminder that the struggle wasn’t wasted. And maybe a gentle nudge to be kinder to yourself when the stylus slips.

I wonder… if you wrote to your younger self, would you speak to the artist, the scholar, or the dreamer who first fell in love with art? Or would you let them figure it out on their own?
[B]: Ah, what a tender and truthful note. I daresay your younger self would have felt both comforted and challenged by it—an ideal balance, really. We are all, in our creative lives, walking a tightrope between doubt and devotion.

If I were to write, I think I would address the girl who first fell in love with Keats’ , her fingers tracing the margins of a borrowed book, her heart swelling with a beauty she couldn’t yet name. I’d whisper something like this:



And yes, I’d let her stumble a bit. Perhaps even encouraged it. Because it was in the misreadings, the awkward essays, the failed attempts at eloquence that she truly learned how to feel, and then how to think.

We learn best when we are slightly off-balance, don’t you think? Like a drawing that leans too far one way until suddenly—it’s alive.
[A]: That’s breathtaking — the idea of learning not in spite of our missteps, but  of them. It makes me think that maybe art, at its core, is just a long apprenticeship in paying attention — to the world, to ourselves, and especially to those quiet, almost imperceptible moments between things.

I love how you framed it: letting the mystery remain. I think we often forget that wonder isn’t something we outgrow — it’s something we have to protect, like a flame in a storm. And sometimes, the storm is just part of the journey.

You know, your younger self tracing those margins — she’s still in you, isn’t she? Still reading between the lines, still chasing the echo of a nightingale’s song. Maybe that’s what we’re always doing, in every sketch, every lecture, every pixel placed with care: trying to catch that feeling again. Not the certainty, but the awe.

And I do believe you're right — balance is overrated. It’s in the leaning, the reaching, the tipping too far forward that we finally make something that breathes.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—. Yes, that feels precisely right. Art is not the acquisition of skill so much as the cultivation of . To see fully, to feel truly—that is the quiet labor of a lifetime.

And you’re quite right about wonder. It is not a childish thing we must grow out of, but a flame we must learn to carry carefully through the windiness of adulthood. Sometimes it flickers low, sometimes it flares unexpectedly—but oh, how we need it.

You know, I often think that every artist, scholar, or dreamer carries with them a kind of internal compass—one that doesn’t point north, but toward awe. And we follow it, even when the terrain grows difficult, even when the map runs out. Because in the end, it’s not about arriving at certainty. It’s about staying open to the next question, the next glimpse of something just beyond our reach.

So yes, let us lean too far. Let us tip forward into the unknown. For it is there, off-balance and a little lost, that we finally make something that sings.
