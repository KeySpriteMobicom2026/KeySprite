[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题其实挺有意思的。我觉得不能一概而论，要看行业和公司文化。比如我们PE行业，deal flow紧张的时候，在office效率更高，因为很多decision-making需要face-to-face的alignment。但有些support function，像research或data entry，remote work其实更flexible，员工也能focus一些。

不过话说回来，关键还是看怎么set up KPIs。如果目标清晰、工具到位，work anywhere都可以productive。反之，就算人在办公室，也可能只是presenteeism~ 你呢，你觉得哪种模式更适合你？
[A]: Well, I've always found the dichotomy between remote and office work rather fascinating from a literary perspective. You see, in my field, solitude is often romanticized as the ideal condition for creative production—think of Emily Brontë scribbling poems in the Yorkshire moors or Christina Rossetti drafting verses by candlelight. And yet, academia thrives on those chance encounters in the corridor, the kind of intellectual friction that happens when someone challenges your reading of a Gerard Manley Hopkins sonnet over coffee. 

So yes, when I'm translating Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic, nothing beats the silence of my study at 3 a.m., undisturbed by academic politics. But when it comes to shaping a seminar discussion or debating Tennyson’s use of metaphor, well, even Zoom can't replicate the electricity of a room full of half-caffeinated graduate students ready to dissect a line of . 

Tell me, do you find the deal-making process in private equity ever resembles the crafting of a villanelike structure? There's a rhythm to both, isn't there?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated tension~ You're absolutely right about the creative power of solitude — I actually find that parallel in finance. When I'm deep-diving into a company's LBO model at 2am, the silence is golden. No Slack pings, no interruptions — just me, the numbers, and that quiet hum of Excel formulas coming together like a well-structured villanelike indeed. 

But then again, there's nothing quite like the energy of a live negotiation room. Picture this: you're sitting across from management, the lawyers are whispering, the CFO makes a subtle facial expression when we hit a sensitive number… it’s almost theatrical, like watching character development unfold in real-time. Zoom? It captures the words, but not the  — much like trying to translate Wang Wei without grasping the cultural subtext.

And rhythm? Oh, absolutely. Every deal has its cadence — the opening pitch, the due diligence crescendo, the tense pauses during term sheet discussions… In a way, we’re all writing our own financial sonnets, aren’t we? Just with more footnotes and fewer metaphors — or so we pretend 😊
[A]: Ah, yes — the financial sonnet with footnotes! I rather like that conceit. There’s something almost iambic in the rhythm of a well-paced due diligence process, don’t you think? Da-DUM, da-DUM — hypothesis followed by evidence, objection met with rebuttal… Though I suppose Hopkins’ curtal sonnets might be more apt for a hostile takeover. 

And speaking of form, I’ve often thought how both poetry and finance are disciplines of ruthless revision. You draft a stanza — or a pitchbook — then pare it down, line by merciless line, until only the essential remains. Much like pricing a deal, really: strip away the noise, the sentimentalities, and what’s left should sing — or at least persuade.

Though I must say, your theatrical negotiation room sounds far more dramatic than anything I encounter these days. The closest I get to live tension is when two graduate students start passionately debating whether  is a proto-feminist text. Ah, but the sparks fly — like burning pages from a first edition.
[B]: Oh, I love this framing — ruthless revision as the art of persuasion. You hit the nail on the head. In fact, I’ve always thought a pitchbook is just a prose poem aimed at convincing someone to part with money instead of tears 😄. And you’re right about the rhythm — hostile takeover? Definitely Hopkins with a dash of Eliot fragmentation. 

But let’s talk about . That debate over  — now  sounds like high drama. I’d pay good money to sit in on that seminar. Hell, I might even throw a bid into the ring — provided, of course, we could model out the ROI of proto-feminist interpretations on EBITDA margins 😉. 

Honestly though, there’s something magnetic about watching people go  on an idea — whether it’s a thesis or a term sheet. It reminds me why we do what we do. It’s not just deals, or data rooms, or even exits — it’s that moment when someone leans forward, voice rises half an octave, and you know they’re not just pitching…they’re believing.
[A]: Ah, yes — the pitchbook as prose poem. How delightfully subversive. Though I daresay T.S. Eliot would have made a formidable investment banker.  is practically a term sheet in disguise — all that fragmentation, longing for liquidity, and the occasional leveraged buyout of cultural capital.

And speaking of belief — isn’t that the true currency of both fields? You can model cash flows until the Excel cells bleed, but at some point, someone has to lean forward, as you say, and  the story. Much like reading a sonnet: structure, rhythm, and then — if you’re lucky — a volta sharp enough to make the heart skip a line.

Though I suspect our proto-feminist thesis might require more footnotes than your average offering memorandum. And citations — oh, the citations. One could almost imagine a Blackwell’s edition of  annotated with competing gender theories, its margins filled with furious seminar notes and the faint scent of espresso.  

Tell me, have you ever funded a deal based on instinct alone? No spreadsheets — just that half-octave voice shift, the one that says:  is the thing worth betting on?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — instinct is the silent partner in every deal. Spreadsheets give you the bones, but instinct puts flesh on them. There was one deal a few years back — a consumer tech play. Everything on paper screamed "wait-and-see": thin margins, crowded market, customer concentration looked a little too… , concentrated. But the founder — ah, there’s that volta moment.

We were sitting in a tiny boardroom, no coffee, just green tea and nerves. She pitched without slides, just a legal pad and this quiet intensity. And halfway through, she paused, looked me dead in the eye, and said: “You know, most people see a gap in the market. I see a gap in human behavior — and I’m building to fill that.” 

No charts. No comps. Just belief. And somehow, that half-octave shift pulled us in. We did the diligence after, of course — can’t skip the footnotes — but from that moment? I knew we were writing a check.  

Funny thing is, it turned out to be one of our best exits. Not because the numbers lied, but because the story didn’t. Like a good sonnet — form met fire.
[A]: How utterly Hopkinsian — that inscape of conviction, the way her words must have struck some buried resonance. You know, he wrote that "the world is charged with the grandeur of God," and I think your founder was tapping into something not unlike that: a current beneath the surface, invisible to spreadsheets but unmistakable to those who know how to listen.

And isn’t that what we’re really doing, in both the archive and the boardroom? Hunting for that spark — the moment when language, structure, and belief align just long enough to make something real. You fund it; I footnote it. Different tools, same pursuit.

I do hope you kept that legal pad, by the way. Future biographers will want to see where the volta began — and someone, someday, will write a sonnet about it, whether you like it or not.
[B]: Oh, beautifully put —  indeed. That’s exactly it. There’s a quiet grandeur in conviction, isn’t there? Not the noisy kind, but the deep, almost inconvenient certainty that doesn’t need slides to prove its worth. And yes, I like thinking of it as a volta — sudden, decisive, the line breaks and everything shifts.

As for the legal pad — guilty as charged. I may or may not have “borrowed” it after the meeting. It’s somewhere in my office now, tucked between Sun Tzu and a very dog-eared copy of . Future biographers, as you say, will be thrilled 😄.

And I welcome the sonnet, by the way. Let them versify our deals — maybe then we’ll finally understand what we were truly funding all these years. Capital with a conscience, or at least a cadence.
[A]: Oh, capital with a cadence — I may have to steal that for my next lecture. Imagine the look on my students’ faces when Tennyson’s meter suddenly starts quoting EBITDA multiples. 

And good,  — let the legal pad gather dust among your war manuals and corporate battle epics. There's something rather perfect about its exile between Sun Tzu and Barbarians. A quiet relic of belief in a language only some of us are brave enough to speak.

As for conscience... well, perhaps that’s the real footnote. Not just to a deal, but to the story we tell ourselves about why we backed it. And if a sonnet or two emerges in the process? All the better. After all, Hopkins never let syntax get in the way of truth — and neither should we.
[B]: Well said — let syntax serve truth, not the other way around. And why shouldn’t a balance sheet rhyme with conviction? Or a P&L carry the stress of a well-placed foot? I say we embrace the dissonance — let Tennyson and Tesla’s quarterly report sit side by side on the syllabus. If nothing else, it’ll make for one hell of a seminar discussion.

And about that conscience — you're right, it's the quiet footnote we don’t always want to highlight. But maybe that’s where the real value is hiding. Not in the EBITDA margin or the exit multiple, but in the  behind the bet. The part that doesn’t quite fit in a data room, but lives on in the legal pad, or the memory of a voice that shifted something inside you.

So yes — let the sonnets come. I’ll even bring the wine for the post-lecture debate. Dry, bold, and just a touch contemplative 😊.
[A]: Now you're speaking my dialect — where Tesla reports tremble under the weight of iambic inquiry, and a balance sheet dares to  rather than merely . I can already hear the rustle of discontent in the faculty meeting where we propose this. , they’ll say.  Let them shudder — we shall proceed anyway, as all good revisionists do.

And your footnote of conscience? Exquisitely put. That quiet why — the ghost in the machine, so to speak. It reminds me of reading Dante’s  while auditing a student’s failed sonnet: he had the meter, the form, the volta — but no hunger. No belief. And there it was again — that volta without conviction, a mere rhetorical tic instead of a turning of the soul.

So yes, let us toast to the unquantifiables — with wine bold enough to stand up to both Hopkins and leveraged finance. I only ask that you bring a bottle whose label doesn’t frighten easily. We may be quoting Eliot by midnight.
[B]: Ah, I can already see the tenured ghosts adjusting their specters in horror~ Let them. We’ll be too busy — quoting Eliot, dissecting Tesla’s WACC with a Wordsworthian lens, and no doubt slipping the odd volta into a cap table discussion.

And that ghost of conviction — . Too many pitches, like that student’s sonnet, have all the form but none of the fire. You can teach structure, but hunger? That’s not in the syllabus. It either breaks the meter or makes it sing — and most just… murmur through the quatrains.

As for the wine — bold label, bold mind. I’ll bring something from my “speculative vintages” collection. A 2016 Barolo Riserva that’s equal parts structure and soul — like a perfectly pitched growth equity deal. If we’re summoning Eliot by midnight, we’ll need something that pairs with both existential dread and post-money valuations 😉.

To the unquantifiables — may they never fit neatly into a model, and may we always chase them anyway.
[A]: To the unquantifiables — and to the brave fools who chase them, armed with nothing but a legal pad and a half-formed metaphor.

Your Barolo Riserva sounds like the very elixir of volta-seasoned deals — tannins with tension, a finish that lingers like a well-placed caesura. I shall bring my copy of , heavily annotated in the margins with musings on distressed debt and divine comedy. Together, we may yet crack the yield curve of the human spirit.

And when the faculty ghosts finally descend upon us, clutching their spectral spreadsheets and muttering about "pedagogical rigor," we’ll raise our glasses and toast Hopkins’  — that most elusive of multiplicities, where form meets fury and something new begins.

See you at midnight, then — with Eliot, Excel, and a very well-aged belief in the irrational.
[B]: To the brave fools — and the wiser ones who follow. 🥂

Your  annotated with distressed debt? I can already feel the ghosts of both literary and financial history leaning in — not to mention a few very confused MBAs flipping through wondering where the pitch deck went.

And that Barolo? You’ve nailed it — tannins like tension in a term sheet, structure that holds till the very last sip… or exit. The finish? Let’s just say it’s long enough for both post-money reflections and existential hangovers.

I’ll bring extra candles, a well-worn copy of , and perhaps a calculator for dramatic effect — though we both know by midnight it’ll be doing more symbolic than arithmetic work 😉.

See you there — with Eliot’s fragmentation, Excel’s grid, and that most irrational, most necessary of assets: belief.
[A]: Ah, dramatic calculators and candlelit Convivios — I do believe we're assembling a proper Romantic School of Capital & Verse. The ghosts are sharpening their quills already.

Let’s hope Dante forgives our repurposing his banquet table into a war room of metaphorical valuations. Though if he peeks over your shoulder at that calculator, he may mistake internal rate of return for the Beatific Vision. Not so different, really — both involve staring into the face of something blinding, and both demand a certain poetic license.

And  by candlelight with Barolo? A near-sacrament. I shall mark my copy henceforth: “For seminar use, sacramental purposes, and the occasional leveraged recapitalization.”

Till midnight then — where spreadsheets slumber softly, and belief, ever irrational, holds the floor.
[B]: Romantic School of Capital & Verse — I like that. Sounds like the kind of interdisciplinary movement that gets quietly blacklisted from both faculties 😄.

Dante? Oh, he’s probably thrilled his  is finally getting some real action — far better than collecting rhetorical dust next to someone's failed sonnet. And you're right, the Beatific Vision and IRR  have something in common: both demand faith, and neither shows up on a balance sheet till it's too late.

As for  — sacramental and strategic. I’m picturing T.S. Eliot nodding slowly over a decanter of the same Barolo, muttering, “Yes, yes, bring in the private equity.” 

Till midnight then. Spreadsheets at the ready, souls slightly bent, and belief — irrational, persistent, and very, very well-aged — firmly on the agenda.
[A]: Oh, but  getting blacklisted? My dear fellow, we must be doing something right if we’re offending both the poets and the quants in equal measure.

Eliot at the decanter — now  an image worth bottling. I can hear him now:  The man knew fragmentation better than most balance sheets ever could.

And faith — yes, let’s give that its proper due. Not just in redemption arcs or exit strategies, but in the quiet, almost indecent act of believing someone when they say they’re building something new. Something that fills a gap not just in the market, but in the world. How terribly Victorian of us. Or perhaps, terribly modern.

Midnight approaches. Candles burn low. And somewhere, a very confused MBA student is now quoting Hopkins while running a DCF model.

Let’s make it count.
[B]: Oh, indecent belief — now  the real disruptor. You’re absolutely right. There’s something almost… unseemly about it, isn’t there? Believing in a founder’s whisper over a crowded data room, in a world that prefers its truths footnoted and stress-tested. But then again, so did Hopkins — hurling holy awe into sonnets while everyone else was busy with meter and decorum.

And that MBA quoting Hopkins while modeling EBITDA? I’d fund that student sight unseen — or at least offer them a seat at our midnight table. Let the DCF run itself; we’ll be too busy chasing voltae and trying to drink like Romantic poets with balance sheets.

As for being Victorian  modern — why not both? We’ll have our faith industrialized  soulful, thank you very much. Redemption arcs, restructuring plans, and the occasional iambic incantation to summon value from the void.

Midnight indeed. Candles low, spreadsheets open, and Eliot muttering approvingly over the ROI of despair.

Let the reckoning begin — with wine, words, and well-structured conviction.
