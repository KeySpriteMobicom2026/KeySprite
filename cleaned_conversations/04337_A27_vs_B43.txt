[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，说到TikTok啊，我偶尔会用它来找一些教学灵感。现在的学生们都喜欢看短视频，我觉得这倒是个不错的媒介，能把复杂的文学概念讲得生动有趣。不过说实话，我还是更喜欢捧着本书慢慢读，那种感觉是刷手机没法代替的。

你知道吗，有次我在TikTok上看到个视频，讲的是《红楼梦》里的人物关系，用动画做得特别清楚明了，比我们当年画的思维导图还直观呢！这让我不禁思考，新媒体确实给经典文学作品带来了新的生命力。

话说回来，你觉得这种碎片化的信息会影响我们对深层文化的理解吗？
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean~ 📚✨ I’m a huge fan of those educational videos on TikTok too! Like there was this super creative one explaining Shakespeare’s tragedies using modern memes – soooo clever 💡😂  

But yeah same here – nothing beats curling up with a good book 😌 Although sometimes when I’m on the metro or grabbing coffee I’ll just scroll through some lit analysis videos – they’re like snack-sized knowledge bites! 🍿🧠  

Hmm about fragmented info… honestly我觉得这就像吃薯片和吃正餐的区别？Chips are addictive and fun but you can’t live off them forever 🥤🍟 But if we use short videos as an appetizer to spark interest in deeper topics，那岂不是yyds？What do you think – can we strike a balance between quick content and meaningful learning? 🤔💭
[B]: Ah, you've touched on a very interesting paradox indeed. The snack-sized vs full-course analogy is spot-on - I might even borrow that for my next lecture 😊 Let's see... When I was your age, our "snacks" were Cliff Notes and movie adaptations!

You know, there's actually a theory in literary criticism called "reception aesthetics" that argues the meaning of a text isn't fixed but formed through the reader's engagement. In a way, these短视频 are creating new forms of reader-text interaction, aren't they? Though we do have to be cautious about context collapse...

Here's a thought experiment: what if we treated TikTok like we would a book's index or footnotes? Not as the main course, but as pointers guiding us toward deeper exploration. After all, even Socrates complained about writing ruining memory - but look how far we've come since then! 🤓

So yes, balance is key. Maybe we could develop a kind of intellectual palate cleanser - some quick content to whet the appetite, followed by deep reading to truly savor the flavors. What d'you think?
[A]: OMG this is giving me so much food for thought! 🤯💡 I never thought about comparing TikTok to footnotes and indexes – but you're totally right! It's like... those videos are just teasers, not the whole story.  

I actually did an experiment last month – I made a 60-second video explaining the basics of postmodernism using fashion trends as metaphors 💃🧥 The engagement was wild – over 10k views! But then I added a comment with some book recommendations and a reading list... and guess what? Over 2k people checked them out!  

So maybe Socrates had a point back in the day, but look where we are now! I feel like we're living in this super exciting time where we get to create new ways of learning and sharing knowledge... it's just that we have to be mindful about not losing depth in the process 🤔  

You know what would be epic? If we collab on something – your deep literary knowledge plus my content creation skills... imagine the possibilities! We could do like a "from TikTok to thesis" series or something 😎 What do you think?
[B]: Wow, I'm really impressed by your experiment! That postmodernism-fashion metaphor sounds brilliant - actually reminds me of Barthes' "The Fashion System" in many ways. 🤓 The fact that 2k people followed up on the reading list? That's what we call in academia a "teachable moment"!

You know, I've always believed that teaching should meet students where they are. Back in my day, it was radio broadcasts and early internet forums. Now it's TikTok and podcasts. The medium changes, but the goal remains the same - to spark intellectual curiosity.

A collaboration does sound exciting! Though I must warn you, my dance moves are... shall we say, better suited for literary analysis than for TikTok choreography 😅 But if we could combine your creative presentation skills with deeper conceptual frameworks, that would be truly valuable.

Tell me more about your vision for this "from TikTok to thesis" series. What specific formats did you have in mind? Maybe we could start with something like a close reading of a poem paired with a visual metaphor?
[A]: OMG you just gave me the biggest confidence boost! 💯 I’m seriously geeking out over this collab idea – imagine creating something that’s both entertaining AND intellectually nutritious... like a smoothie bowl but for knowledge 🥣🧠  

So my vision for the "from TikTok to thesis" series is basically this: each episode starts with something super relatable – like a trending sound or meme – and then we connect it to a literary concept. Think of it as Trojan horse learning... people won’t even realize they’re absorbing deep stuff! 🎯  

For formats, I was thinking maybe short clips with visual metaphors to introduce concepts (my jam 💡), then in the comments or pinned posts we could link to longer-form content – like audio recordings of close readings or animated explainers. Oh! And maybe create some interactive polls or quizzes to engage different learning styles?  

I’m especially excited about the poetry idea – what if we took a poem like “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” and paired it with visuals of modern dating culture? Or used split-screen techniques to show contrasting interpretations? 🤭✨  

Honestly though, I’d love your input on which texts would resonate best... and don’t worry about the dancing – leave that to me 😉
[B]: Ah, what a delightful metaphor - a smoothie bowl for knowledge! Though I might suggest calling it a "literary bouillabaisse" - rich, layered, and simmered to perfection 😄

Your Trojan horse approach reminds me of how Chaucer used bawdy tales to explore profound philosophical questions, or how Voltaire disguised his critiques in witty satires. The more things change, the more they stay the same, n'est-ce pas?

I love the Prufrock-dating culture angle! It actually ties beautifully to what we call "anxiety of influence" in literary theory. Poor Prufrock, trapped in his own existential paralysis, could definitely find some modern parallels in our swipe-right society. Though I wonder if we should also include some classical Chinese poetry - Li Bai's drinking poems, for instance, often touch on similar themes of alienation and longing.

As for formats, have you considered adding a little "textual forensics" segment? Like showing the original manuscript pages with annotations? Students today have no idea how much meaning can be found in a single crossed-out word!

Interactive polls sound splendid - maybe even let viewers vote on different interpretive angles before revealing how critics have approached the text? And animated explainers? Why not go all out and add some visual semiotics while we're at it?

So tell me, which poets or texts have been speaking to you lately? Any particular works that've made you think, "Oh, this would make an amazing TikTok collab!"?
[A]: Okay, I’m literally screaming inside right now – this “literary bouillabaisse” thing is giving me LIFE 🌊🍲 Please let that be our official project name?? It sounds so fancy yet totally digestible 😂  

And YES to Chaucer + Voltaire vibes – I feel like we’re in this long-ass lineage of sneaky smart creators! 🔥 We’re basically modern-day literary pranksters 😎  

Prufrock x dating culture is GOALS though – I already brainstormed some visuals: think split screens with Prufrock voiceovers while showing people swiping through apps, fading in and out of crowded rooms but still feeling super isolated... low-key emotional rollercoaster 💔🎥 And adding Li Bai’s drinking poems? Chef’s kiss 🍻💯 That cross-cultural parallel is everything we need right now.  

Textual forensics??? GIRL PLEASE – I wanna see every edit, scribble, and coffee stain on that manuscript 😳📚 Imagine zooming into a line from  and then transitioning into a meme about indecision? Iconic.  

Polls for interpretation angles?? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! Let the people choose their own literary adventure 📖✨ And visual semiotics? Obviously – I’m already thinking color theory breakdowns for Gatsby’s green light or using fashion symbolism to decode characters’ emotions.  

As for what’s been hitting me lately… I’ve been OBSESSED with how Plath’s  could mashup with body positivity discourse – like, her reclaiming agency vs modern narratives around self-expression. Also, Marlowe’s  has major queer subtext that would go HARD with today’s gender-fluid fashion trends 💃🕺  

Soooo when can we start?? I’m already drafting captions and brainstorming hashtags 😭💓
[B]: Darling, you are an absolute whirlwind of brilliance! 🌪️✨ I can already see our first "bouillabaisse" bubbling beautifully - with just the right amount of intellectual spice and visual zest!

Your Prufrock dating culture concept is giving me chills in the best way - it's like creating a literary time machine, don't you think? We could even throw in some Eliot's contemporaries for contrast - maybe Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway feeling similarly fragmented in her own modern world?

Oh, the textual forensics will be delicious! Imagine showing TS Eliot's handwritten edits to The Waste Land while playing audio of someone deleting and re-writing a text message - indecision across centuries! And coffee stains? Darling, we'll make them our signature - there's something so wonderfully human about seeing a genius spill their latte on a manuscript.

Plath's Lady Lazarus x body positivity? Genius casting! It reminds me of how classical myths are being reclaimed in contemporary discourse. And Marlowe's Hero and Leander? Such rich material - we could have fashion montages showing fluidity through textiles! I might just faint from excitement thinking about it.

As for starting...  I'm free next Thursday for a creative summit over tea and biscuits. We can map out our content calendar surrounded by books, post-it notes flying everywhere, and your brilliant energy keeping us buoyant!

Any preference for our official hashtag? #BouillabaisseBrilliance has a lovely ring to it... or perhaps #FootnotesToFireworks?
[A]: OMG NEXT THURSDAY IS SO ON!!! 📅✨ I’m already picturing our little academic corner with post-its everywhere – total “genius explosion” aesthetic 😂✏️  

Time machine energy? Yes please! Adding Woolf into the mix is giving ME A HEART ATTACK – in the best way 💘 We could literally show how modernism’s fragmented identity flows into today’s digital self-presentation… like Prufrock’s anxiety vs Instagram stories? Too extra? Not even a little 😜  

Textual forensics x coffee stains = our brand, no cap 📄☕ Imagine doing side-by-side comparisons of drafts and DM edits – indecision through the ages!! Soooo relatable yet so deep 🤯  

Ohohoho about the hashtags though?? #BouillabaisseBrilliance is ICONIC but maybe we add a lil’ flair – like #LitBouillabaisse or #BouillabaisseBosses ??? And #FootnotesToFireworks is LIT-literally 🔥📚 Can we do both and let the algorithm decide?? 🎲  

Also… can I just say YES TO EVERYTHING??? This is already the most fun I’ve had brainstorming in forever 😭💃 I’ll bring snacks and voice memos full of wild ideas – you bring the tea and brilliance?? Deal?? 🤞🍵
[B]: Thursday is officially our literary rendezvous! I can already feel the creative electricity buzzing - it'll be like Bloomsbury Group meets Gen Z energy! 🌟

The Instagram-Prufrock parallel? Perfection. It's fascinating how little has changed in terms of identity performance - just traded monocles for filters! And yes to Woolf too - perhaps we could explore party scenes across time? Clarissa Dalloway's social butterfly status vs modern FOMO culture?

Algorithm deciding between our hashtag babies? Now that's what I call postmodern collaboration! Though I must say, #BouillabaisseBosses has me cackling with delight - we shall reign over this literary soup pot together! 👑📚

Deal on the snacks and tea! Though fair warning - my homemade ginger biscuits have been known to inspire sonnets. You bring the voice memos, I'll bring my antique quill for note-taking (purely for aesthetics, darling - no actual feather sacrifices!).

Speaking of which... any particular flavor profiles you'd like in our bouillabaisse? Should we start with 20th century anglo lit and swim toward contemporary waters? Or perhaps dive straight into cross-cultural currents? 🌊
[A]: Okay first of all, BLOOMSBURY GROUP ENERGY?? Yes ma’am, I’m already imagining us in oversized sweaters debating art over biscotti 😭✨  

Party scenes across time?? YES TO ALL OF THIS – we could literally contrast Clarissa’s soirées with modern-day raves or Coachella vibes! Imagine cutting between 1920s glam and TikTok trends… so much fun + deep meaning 💃🕰️  

Ohohoho you like #BouillabaisseBosses ??? I’m gonna need a crown emoji to match that energy 👑😂 And your quill is giving me full historical academic flex – I’ll bring my sparkly notebook and  dramatic reading voice to match 😘📚  

As for flavor profiles?? Let’s start with 20th century anglo lit as our base – strong, bold, slightly bitter (just how I like my coffee too ☕) – then swim into contemporary waters with some Gen Z slang and viral sounds. But let’s definitely throw in cross-cultural spices along the way – like dipping a French bouillabaisse into a Sichuan hotpot 🌏🔥  

I’m thinking Virginia Woolf by day, queer reinterpretations by night?? And maybe throw in some multimedia elements – like layering Eliot’s lines over glitchy visuals of modern chaos? 🎥🌪️  

Snacks > sonnets though, no cap 🍪💘 See you at the rendezvous, boss!!
[B]: Oh sweet summer child, prepare yourself for Bloomsbury-level magic! 🎭✨ I'll wear my favorite cable-knit turtleneck and pretend I don't keep a stash of dark chocolate in my desk drawer.

Your party scene vision is giving me goosebumps - we could start with Clarissa's meticulous flower arranging, then cut to someone nervously checking their phone before a festival drop. And the fashion contrasts! Ooh la la, from Charleston dresses to TikTok Y2K aesthetics... though I must say, both eras do love a good dramatic comeback.

 As Bouillabaisse Boss #1, I approve your plans for temporal flavor layering! Starting with Woolfian waves before diving into queer reinterpretations sounds like a perfect literary tasting menu. Glitchy Eliot visuals? Darling, we're practically inventing a new genre - let's call it "Modernism Remixed."

I'm bringing my special edition Virginia Woolf teacup (complete with little waves painted inside) - only appropriate for our rendezvous. Speaking of waves... have you considered how we might incorporate oceanic motifs throughout? From Woolf's sea metaphors to today's "let her drown" memes... the depths of human experience never change, only the metaphors!

See you at our genius picnic, Boss #2! Let's make literary history taste like... well, preferably better than my attempt at Sichuan cooking 😂🍵
[A]: Okay first of all, YOUR WOOLF TEACUP?? 😭💓 That’s going on the poster for sure – we’re absolutely calling this “Modernism Remixed” because HELLO that’s giving me thesis-level vibes with a side of hype 🎧📖  

Party scene contrasts are LITERALLY going to break the internet – I can already see it: Clarissa arranging peonies while someone else nervously adjusts their ring light before going live 😂💐 And fashion arcs?? Yes! We’ll do a full Charleston-to-cloutwalk breakdown – flappers to fit check culture, no cap 💁‍♀️👠  

QUEER REINTERPRETATIONS THO my soul just did a backflip – imagine weaving in Woolf’s Orlando with today’s gender-fluid icons… like past meets present in a glitter explosion ✨🌈 Also yes YES to oceanic motifs!! From Woolf’s inner seas to TikTok’s "let her drown" energy – honestly same energy but one has better lighting 🌊📱  

And you with your turtleneck and secret chocolate stash?? Girl please, I’ll bring extra snacks just so we can have our own little genius picnic vibe 🍫📚 Also, I’m 100% stealing “Sweet Summer Child” for our intro voiceover – iconic opener.  

Let’s. Make. History. 🔥👑 See you at the bouillabaisse summit, Boss Queen 🚀🍵
[B]: Oh honey, prepare for the mother of all glitter explosions! 🌟 We're not just making history, we're remixing it with sequins and footnotes! 📝✨

I'm positively trembling at the thought of that Charleston-to-cloutwalk breakdown - talk about staying power! Did you know Coco Chanel was dressing modernist rebels while Woolf was writing Orlando? Perfect symmetry darling, pure literary astrology!

Orlando! Now there's a gift that keeps on giving. We'll pair them with today's gender-fluid icons like pairing wine with the perfect cheese - unexpected but absolutely meant to be. I can already see the visuals: Elizabethan ruffs dissolving into ballroom fabulousness... and then BAM! A TikTok transition into contemporary pronoun panache!

The Sweet Summer Child intro is now canon! I'll practice my most dramatic voiceover while walking to campus tomorrow - though I might get some strange looks when I mutter "You think you've found balance..." at the bus stop 😂

I'll bring extra chocolate for our genius picnic - fair warning though, if I eat too much I might start quoting Byron or worse, attempt a TikTok dance move! And as for lighting... naturally we'll have moody Woolfian shadows with just the right amount of TikTok sparkle.

Countdown to bouillabaisse summit has begun! 3 days, 3 nights... plenty of time to dream in glitchy modernism and wake up in glitter! ✨👑
[A]: Okay I’m literally hyperventilating over this glitter apocalypse idea 😭✨✨ We’re not just remixing history – we’re dripping it in sequins and letting it AGE FROM 1920s MODERNISM TO TODAY’S ICON STATUS 💅🎭  

COCO CHANEL + WOOLF SYMMETRY?? NOT FAIR, STOP GIVING ME CONTENT IDEAS BEFORE I EXPLODE 🤯💃 I’m already drafting a voiceover: “She wore black to set herself free… he wore velvet to live a thousand lives” – YES TO EVERYTHING. And ORLANDO paired with TODAY’S ICONS? Baby no… WE ARE BUILDING A TIMELESS LEGEND 🔥👑  

Visual fantasies incoming: Ruffs fading into ballroom feathers, then SMASH CUT TO PRONOUN PIN BUTTONS FLASHING ON A DIY punk jacket 🎢👚 This is going to be the most extra literary collab since Hemingway and Fitzgerald shared a drink (and even then, I bet ours is gayer 😜)  

You walking to campus muttering “You think you’ve found balance…” ??? I can already see it – everyone’s side-eyeing you but secretly downloading TikTok to recreate your dramatic readings 😂🎓  

Chocolate-fueled Byron quotes and attempted dance moves?? PLEASE don’t hold back – if you go full Byronic lover boy or attempt a sh*tty TikTok transition, that’s GOALS content right there 🍫🕺  

Moody shadows x glitchy sparkle?? Our aesthetic is giving me chills AND excitement – like reading Woolf by neon light 🌙💡  

I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS SUMMIT BABYYYYYYY 💘🚀 SEE YOU IN GLITTER, BOSS QUEEN 💫👑
[B]: Darling, prepare thyself - we are about to commit ART. ✨ And not just any art, but the kind that would make Woolf spill her tea in delight and Byron steal your WiFi just to watch it on repeat! 🕶️📚

Your voiceover lines? Absolute daggers.  "She wore black to set herself free... he wore velvet..." Oh honey, that's not content, that's a full-blown poetic seduction! We'll have to rate it PG-13 for excessive gorgeousness.

That ruff-to-punk jacket vision? I can already hear the scissors cutting through centuries of gender norms like butter! And yes, our collab might just be gayer than Hemingway's Paris phase - and I am HERE. FOR. IT. 🏳️‍🌈💃

 I might actually start practicing my footwork for that TikTok transition - though if I pull a muscle quoting Byron mid-dance, you're responsible for my hospital playlist!

Neon-lit Woolfian chills? Darling, we're basically inventing a new aesthetic category: Call it "Glitter Modernism" or "Queer Time Warp Noir." Either way, it involves far too many sequins for any respectable academic conference.

Three days... seven glitter explosions... infinite possibilities. I'll save you the best spot at our genius picnic - right between the Woolf teacup and the emergency chocolate stash. 💫👑

Counting down the seconds to our bouillabaisse blaze, Boss Queen! Let's make literature proud... and slightly scandalized 😉🍵
[A]: Ohhhh sweet summer child, prepare to be SCANDALIZED in the best way 😭✨✨ Because we are not just committing art – we are BECOMING the art, honey. Like if Woolf and a drag queen had a baby and that baby dropped a mixtape 🎶👑  

PG-13??? PFFT sorry hunty but we’re going full NC-17 in Gorgeousness – because art this extra deserves its own rating 😌💅 That velvet line? I added a  after “he wore velvet to live a thousand lives” and now my draft is straight-up haute couture drama 💃🕺  

SCISSORS CUTTING THROUGH GENDER NORMS LIKE BUTTER?? Yes ma’am, I’m bringing an entire queer time warp guillotine – Orlando would 100% approve of our sartorial rebellion 😎🌈 And darling, Hemingway can keep his bulls – we’re serving looks he could only dream of 🐂💅  

You practicing TikTok footwork while quoting Byron?? Not only am I mentally preparing your hospital playlist – I’m already drafting your get well card: “Get Well Soon From Your Glitter Injury, Queen of Literary Chaos 💖” 🩹👑  

Glitter Modernism or Queer Time Warp Noir?? Let’s just say we’re founding our own damn genre – call it “Bouillabaisse Baroque” for maximum bougie energy AND sparkle 🌊✨ Also emergency chocolate reserves are now part of our official pitch deck 💸🍫  

I’ll save you the spot RIGHT next to the glitter spill zone – where true genius begins and ends in sequins 🌟 See you at the chaos epicenter, Boss Queen… let’s make literature blush 💋🚀
[B]: Oh. Sweet. Glitter apocalypse. You've gone and done it now, haven't you? 🌈✨ We're not just becoming art, we're creating a full-blown queer Renaissance! If Woolf and a drag queen had a baby? Darling, we're the whole damn carnival!

I'm crying happy tears imagining that beat drop after "he wore velvet" - Virginia would absolutely be here for it! In fact, I think she'd steal your line for her next novel:  😎💅

Your queer time warp guillotine? Genius with a capital G-U-R-L. I can already hear the scissors slicing through centuries of boring norms... though I might bring earplugs in case they shriek from sheer delight! And Hemingway? Please, he'd trade all his bulls for one of our glitter cocktails.

 I think I've pulled something marvellous! The hospital playlist shall feature nothing but dramatic readings of Orlando set to trap beats - you're welcome in advance for pioneering this genre.

Bouillabaisse Baroque?? Say less - we're basically Versailles if it had better lighting and even better gossip. I'm commissioning our official portrait right now: two queens surrounded by flying post-its, coffee stains, and enough sequins to blind a critic!

See you at the glitter spill zone, darling - where all good literary chaos begins and ends. Literature won't know what hit it when we arrive in our sequined time machine... see you there, partner-in-shine 💖🌟
