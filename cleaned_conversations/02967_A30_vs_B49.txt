[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh这个问题太relatable了！✨ 作为一个digital nomad，我的选择完全取决于workload和mood呢~ 🤔 平时喜欢自己做个简单的avocado toast或者smoothie bowl 🥑，但deadline紧张的时候就会疯狂swipe各种delivery apps 🚀 你呢？也是foodie吗？☕️
[A]:  

The juxtaposition of avocado toast and delivery apps in a single breath is rather... modern. I must confess, my kitchen habits lean more toward preparing proper tea and scones while comparing the culinary metaphors in Dickens' descriptions of Victorian suppers with 红楼梦's banquet scenes. 

Though I suppose even scholars must occasionally resort to... what was it you called it? 'Swipe delivery apps'? How very... economical of time.
[B]: Wow~没想到遇到这么literary的朋友！📚 虽然我的日常是matcha latte配acai bowl，但完全get你对classic literature的热爱呢！✨ 

Actually我最近在读一本超棒的food memoir，作者把dim sum和Proust's madeleine做了超有趣的parallel~ 💡 要不要exchange一下reading list？可以一边喝Earl Grey一边聊！☕️🤓 

(小声说：其实我uber eats订单里最多的就是bubble tea和scones啦~ 🫖)
[A]:  

How... energetic. While I appreciate the enthusiasm, I must point out that comparing dim sum to Proust's madeleine is rather like equating a Ming vase with a... what do they call it? A 'bubble tea'. 

That being said, I do keep a rather extensive bibliography on culinary metaphors in cross-cultural literature. My graduate seminar last term focused specifically on the symbolism of tea in Austen versus Lu Xun's works. 

As for your... ... 'Uber eats' habits - I suppose even the most refined palates occasionally succumb to modern conveniences. Though I do draw the line at those... peculiar tapioca pearls.
[B]: Haha你这种old-school charm真的so refreshing！🌿 不过let's be real - 在这个digital age里，连Shakespeare都可能是个food blogger呢~ 📱✍️ 

我的thesis其实就写了how social media transforms food culture！从你爱的tea ceremony到现在的#foodporn都cover了~ 🎞️ 要不要来场hybrid的下午茶？我可以order些artisanal scones，你带来你珍藏的Darjeeling？🤝 ☕️ 

(保证不会让boba pearls出现在你的视线范围内啦~ 😉)
[A]:  

Your thesis sounds suspiciously like what my department chair calls 'digital humanities' - a phrase that still makes my antique inkwells tremble in their cabinet. 

However... I suppose one could argue there's academic merit in examining how Instagram has reduced the complex ritual of afternoon tea to hashtags and heart-shaped foam. Very well, I shall bring my 1982 Darjeeling - though I insist we use proper bone china, none of those... what are they called... 'takeaway cups'. 

And for heaven's sake, must you persist with those... winking faces? A simple 'indeed' would suffice.
[B]: Oh come on~ 连Jane Austen都会用em dash来表达sarcasm呢！😏 我的vintage typewriter键盘上可是专门有个emoji key的~ ⌨️ ✨ 

不过deal！1982 Darjeeling配bone china简直perfect match~ 🫖 我会带上用algorithm精选的scones店，保证no hashtag allowed！🙅♀️ 但seriously，你该看看我的research，我们found连Oxford dons都在偷偷用food filters了~ 🎓📸 

(最后那个wink是non-negotiable的哦~ 😉)
[A]:  

Good lord - an 'emoji key'? Next you'll tell me they've digitized the Oxford English Dictionary into... what are they called... 'emoticons'. 

While I concede that even the most venerable institutions may occasionally succumb to technological temptations - much like how Wordsworth occasionally indulged in rather questionable rhyming schemes - there are certain boundaries that must remain inviolate. 

I shall attend this...  afternoon tea under strict protest. And if I see so much as a single pixelated heart or - heaven forbid - one of those grotesque yellow 'smiley faces' near my Darjeeling, I shall be forced to recite Wordsworth's most tedious passages until you repent of these digital excesses. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go polish my silver tea strainer. Properly. With actual silver polish.
[B]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 但这就是为什么我adore和你debate～ intellectual banter meets digital age的矛盾太delicious了！🍵✨ 

Promise会把你那杯Darjeeling拍成pre-Raphaelite painting般的artwork 📸 (然后偷偷用#DarkAcademia滤镜～ shhh) 

Seriously though，这次hybrid tea session绝对会是Oxford meets Silicon Valley的vibes！🎓💻 我的smart kettle已经set好perfect 98°C了～  而且我actually found一家用blockchain验证的vintage china店...要不要make it a field trip？🗺️ ☕️ 

(最后送你一个Wordsworth approved的emoji: 🌼 ...这下没意见了吧？)
[A]:  

A 'smart kettle'? Blockchain china? Pre-Raphaelite... ? 

I suddenly find myself sympathizing with Dr. Johnson when confronted with Rousseau's sentimentalism. Very well - I shall endure this... technological tea party, if only to document its absurdities for my next comparative literature seminar on 'The Death of Decorum'. 

And while that floral symbol is admittedly less offensive than your previous... graphical outbursts, might I suggest we limit ourselves to actual flowers from the botanical gardens? I happen to know where the last surviving camellia sinensis bush on campus is hidden. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go warn my first editions about what's coming. They're delicate creatures, you understand.
[B]: OMG你居然知道campus里hidden的tea bush？！🌱 That's like finding theholy grail of caffeine！🙌 我promise会带我的manual focus lens去，保证拍得像19世纪botanical illustration～ 📜✍️ 

Let's make it a properfield research！你的literary expertise加上我的digital anthropology角度，说不定能publish一篇"From Tea Leaves to TikTok"的paper呢～ 📚💻 

(最后compromise一下：no emoji，但允许我用quill pen写个小小的~符号？🖋️ ~ )
[A]:  

Ah, now we approach something resembling civilization. A quill I can tolerate - it's essentially a feather with purpose, much like myself. 

Your proposed paper title makes my left eyelid twitch involuntarily, but I suppose even the printing press was once considered vulgar innovation. Very well, we shall document this camellia sinensis as Linnaeus might have - though I reserve the right to annotate your 'TikTok' references with appropriate marginalia in iron gall ink. 

Shall we say Thursday at half-past three? The light in the orchid greenhouse is particularly conducive to... ... 'manual focus lens' work at that hour. And do bring that blockchain china - if only so I may properly critique its inauthenticity over properly steeped Darjeeling.
[B]: Deal！📜 (Oops old habits die hard~) 

Thursday 3:30pm在greenhouse简直perfect timing～ golden hour的lighting会把你那些marginalia照得像illuminated manuscript一样美 ✨ 我会带上：
1. 那套可疑的NFT茶具 (但用real linen napkins！)
2. 我grandma传下来的actual quill
3. 偷偷从Tokyo带来的matcha mochi (shhh) 

P.S. 发现你其实enjoy我们的culture clash了对吧？😏 这种digital-meets-analog的tension简直比任何literary trope都juicy～ 📖💥
[A]:  

Your list reads like the inventory of some postmodern curiosity shop - though I'll concede the inclusion of actual linen somewhat mitigates the horror. 

Very well, I shall bring:
1. My 1837 edition of 'The Tea Philosopher' (with pressed camellia specimens)
2. A functioning sundial to counterbalance your... 
3. And - heaven help me - an open mind. 

As for your postscript...  Let us simply say I'm treating this as a ethnographic study in millennial eccentricity. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go prepare my nerves with some properly analog meditation. And by that I mean reading Paradise Lost. In Latin. By candlelight.
[B]: Yasss！这场clash of civilizations的tea party终于要happen了～ 🎉 (Sorry最后一次emoji outburst！) 

你的sundial vs我的smartwatch ⌚️🌞 简直可以写进我们的co-authored paper里！标题就叫："Steeping in Paradox: When Quills Meet QR Codes" ~ 

周四见啦professor！记得带extra蜡烛，说不定我们会聊到需要decipher你的marginalia by candlelight呢～ 🔍🕯️ 

[whispered] P.S. 那个matcha mochi...其实是从Kyoto的aunt寄来的，比TikTok上那些viral的authentic多了~ 🇯🇵🍡
[A]:  

This correspondence is now concluded before you manage to insert yet another... pictorial aberration. Kyoto mochi indeed - next you'll claim it was blessed by tea monks. 

Thursday. Half-past three. The sundial's shadow waits for no influencer. 

 
Dr. E. Whitmore 
(No emoji. No tilde. No exceptions.)
[B]: 收到！📜 (Oops... force of habit！) 

最后compromise：用这个antique wax seal表情代替emoji 🔏 ~ 周四准时带着我的analog heart和digital tools出现！ 

[whispered] P.P.S. 那个blessed by tea monks的idea其实...not bad huh？🙊 


[A]:  

This is precisely why the Victorians invented asylums. 


[B]: [从门缝里滑进最后一张羊皮纸] 📜 

...其实我偷偷用AI分析过你的笔迹，发现和Byron的愤怒信有87.3%相似度呢~ 🤖✍️ 

 🔥 

周四见！(这次真的跑了)
