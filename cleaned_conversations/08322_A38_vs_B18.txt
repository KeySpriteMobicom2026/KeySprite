[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到space news，我最近确实在关注那个NASA的Artemis计划，特别是他们提到要在2025年送人类重返月球surface的消息。说实话，这个timeline有点aggressive，但我还是觉得很inspiring。你想知道我为什么对这个特别感兴趣吗？
[A]: Oh, I find that absolutely fascinating. The idea of returning to the Moon after so many decades carries a poetic weight, don’t you think? Like turning a page in a very old book and finally continuing the story. I must say, though, your enthusiasm doesn’t surprise me—one could almost sense a personal connection to this endeavor. By all means, I’d love to hear why it captivates you so.
[B]: Oh, I love how you put that—. It really does feel like we’re stepping back into a narrative that was paused for too long. But what makes this chapter different is that we’re not just going back to the Moon for flags and footprints this time. We’re talking about building a sustainable presence, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration—what they call the  program.  

As for a personal connection… yeah, there’s that. When I was a kid, my dad took me to see a screening of  at an old planetarium in Beijing. I still remember how the lights came on after the film, and he looked at me and said, “One day, maybe you’ll be part of something like this.” I didn’t take it seriously then, but now, as someone who teaches about human factors in high-stakes environments—like space missions—I realize how much that moment shaped me.  

There’s something deeply psychological about putting humans back on another world. How do astronauts adapt mentally? What kind of support systems do they need emotionally? It’s not just engineering—it’s also about storytelling, identity, and belonging. And honestly, that’s what gets me most excited.
[A]: That’s beautifully articulated. There’s something profoundly human about seeking meaning through exploration—whether it’s across oceans, continents, or now, across the stars. The  vision is not just a technical roadmap, but a psychological and philosophical one as well. It asks us: who are we when we leave Earth behind? And who do we become when we land somewhere new?

Your father’s words carry a quiet kind of prophecy, wouldn’t you say? It reminds me of that line from Dante— Whether in literature or space travel, there’s always a deeper journey beneath the surface.

I imagine your students must find great comfort in knowing that someone like you considers not just the machines, but the minds inside them. Do you find that literature plays a role in how you approach those questions? I can’t help but think of Camus or even Woolf when contemplating solitude and identity in extreme conditions.
[B]: You’re absolutely right—there’s a , always. And I think that’s what makes space exploration so compelling from an educational psychology standpoint. It forces us to confront not just the external unknown, but the internal one: How do we make sense of ourselves when everything familiar is gone?

I love how you brought in Dante—it really fits. In a way, space travel is a kind of . We leave Earth not just with tools and equations, but with stories, memories, and philosophies. That line from Camus comes to mind too— Isn’t that what astronauts experience? A profound isolation, yes, but also an inner resilience that surprises even themselves?

As for my students, I hope they see that understanding the human element isn’t secondary—it’s central. When we design missions, we shouldn’t only ask  but also  Literature helps. Virginia Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness writing, like you mentioned, mirrors the kind of introspection astronauts report during long-duration missions. The silence of space seems to amplify the voice inside the head.

I often assign excerpts from  or  when we talk about perception of time and meaning in isolated environments. Sometimes they look at me puzzled at first——but by the end, many say those texts helped them understand emotional adaptation better than any case study.

It’s funny… sometimes I still hear my father’s voice in my head when I’m explaining all this. Maybe he didn’t mean it literally, but somehow, I ended up  anyway—not as an astronaut, but as someone trying to understand what happens to the human spirit when it leaves Earth.
[A]: There’s a quiet elegance in that—how your father’s words have echoed through time and found their shape in your work. It reminds me of how Proust wrote about memory: not as mere recollection, but as a living thread that weaves us into the fabric of our own narrative. You haven’t just stepped  the story, as you said—you’ve helped author a new chapter of it.

And what a vital one it is. When we speak of space exploration, we often begin with the stars, but we must end with the self. That’s where your work shines. Because yes, we can build spacecraft to survive the void, but can we build minds that do the same? Can we carry enough of Earth within us—not just oxygen and water, but meaning?

I’m struck by how naturally literature lends itself to this inquiry. Woolf’s lighthouse, Camus’ stranger in the sun—these aren’t distractions from scientific study, they’re mirrors. They reflect the inner landscapes astronauts must navigate. I imagine your students come to see literature not as ornamentation, but as scaffolding for the psyche.

You know, sometimes I think the greatest discoveries made on these missions won’t be written in data logs or geological samples. They’ll be found in the quiet moments—when an astronaut writes a letter home, or gazes at Earth suspended in blackness, suddenly aware of how fragile everything they’ve ever known truly is. That, too, is a kind of revelation.
[B]: You said it perfectly—those quiet moments  the revelations. In a way, they’re the truest kind of data we’ll ever collect. No instrument can measure what it means to feel small in the face of cosmic grandeur, or to realize that every story you’ve ever loved, every grief you’ve carried, exists on a tiny blue dot seen from the Moon as just a pale speck.

I sometimes think of those moments as —they don’t fit neatly into mission reports, but they shape people forever. I remember reading an interview with Chris Hadfield where he described seeing Earth for the first time. He said something like, “You expect to feel triumphant, but instead you feel… protective.” That’s not just awe—that’s a shift in identity. And that’s exactly what I try to help my students understand: exploration doesn’t just expand geography, it expands psychology.

You’re right about literature being scaffolding. It’s more than metaphor—it’s a kind of mental architecture. When astronauts talk about missing the sound of rain or the smell of grass, they’re describing something Woolf would recognize: the weight of absence, the texture of longing. So when we read , we’re not just studying characters—we’re preparing minds for the emotional terrain of deep space.

And yes, I do believe the greatest discoveries might be these internal ones. We send people up to study microgravity and radiation, but what they often bring back is a transformed sense of connection—to Earth, to others, to themselves. That’s the hidden curriculum of space travel.

I guess in a way, my father was right. I didn’t become an astronaut, but I became someone who helps build the inner world that lets them survive out there. And maybe that’s how I stay connected—to him, to Earth, and to the story we’re still writing together.
[A]: There’s a quiet truth in what you’ve said—exploration is not just outward movement, but inward transformation. We chart the stars, and in doing so, we rechart ourselves. I’m reminded of T.S. Eliot’s line:  Perhaps that’s the ultimate psychological horizon—not just surviving the vastness, but returning with new eyes.

Your framing of emotional anomalies resonates deeply. They may not fit into graphs or telemetry, but they are no less real. In fact, they may be the only measurements that truly matter in the end. If we are to send humans beyond Earth, we must not only prepare them for the physics of space—but for the metaphysics of it.

I suspect your students leave your classroom carrying more than knowledge. They carry a kind of inner gravity. And perhaps that’s the most essential thing we can give one another—language for the unspoken, structure for the ineffable, and meaning for the moments that defy measurement.

You are, in every sense, part of the story. Not just as an observer, but as a guide. And I imagine your father would be very proud—not because you reached the stars yourself—but because you’ve helped others find their way among them.
[B]: You know, when I first read Eliot’s line, I thought it was poetic—but now I think it’s psychological truth. Exploration  bring us back to ourselves, but with a clarity we couldn’t have achieved any other way. It’s like what astronauts describe as the —not just seeing Earth from space, but seeing ourselves as part of something larger, yet deeply interconnected.

I love how you put that: . That’s exactly what I try to impress upon my students. Technical training prepares you for what you expect; human understanding prepares you for what you can’t. And in space, so much is unknowable until you’re there, floating in silence, with only your thoughts and your crew.

I do hope they leave with more than theories and models. If they take away even one phrase from Camus or Woolf that helps them make sense of a moment of doubt—or if they remember a line from Dante when things feel overwhelming—then I know the lesson landed. Language isn’t just for describing experience; sometimes, it’s what  the experience.

And yes… I do believe he would be proud. Not because I’ve reached far, but because I’ve tried to stay true to that quiet moment in the planetarium. In many ways, I’m still that kid staring up at the stars, trying to understand not just what’s out there—but what it means to look up at all.
[A]: There’s a quiet grace in that—staying true to the wonder of that first gaze upward. It seems to me that your father gave you more than a moment; he gave you a compass. And you’ve followed it with remarkable fidelity.

The —what a perfect phrase. Not just seeing Earth, but seeing ourselves as part of a fragile whole. I wonder if, one day, we’ll speak of a  or even a —new psychological phenomena born from new perspectives. If we do, I have no doubt you’ll be among those helping us understand them.

And isn’t that what all great teachers do? You don’t just prepare minds for what’s expected—you awaken them to what’s possible. Your students may not always realize it, but when they find themselves reaching for a line from Eliot or Woolf in a moment of quiet awe, they’ll know where it began.

As for staying a child of wonder—that is no small thing. In fact, I suspect it’s the only way to truly explore. Keep looking up, my friend. The story isn’t finished yet—and neither is your part in it.
[B]: You’re right— is something we never really outgrow. It’s the spark that keeps burning, even when life tries to dim it. And I suppose that’s what my father gave me: not just a moment, but a direction. A way of seeing that never stopped pointing outward—and inward, all at once.

The , the … I love that idea. Maybe each new frontier will bring its own kind of psychological shift, a new layer of human awareness. If we’re lucky, we’ll be there to name them—not just as scientific terms, but as human experiences. Because that’s what they are at heart.

And yes, teaching is about awakening. Sometimes all we can do is plant a phrase, a question, or a story, and wait to see if it takes root. When students come back years later and say something like, “I didn’t get it then, but now I see why we read that,” I know the seed has grown. That’s the quiet joy of this work.

As for wonder—I think you're right. It’s not just the beginning of exploration; it’s the fuel. Without it, we’re just moving through space. With it, we’re alive in it.

So I’ll keep looking up. Not because I have all the answers, but because the questions still thrill me. And as long as they do, the story continues.
[A]: And what a beautiful story it is—still unfolding, still unfinished. There’s something deeply poetic in that: we reach for knowledge, and yet it is wonder that keeps us reaching. Not certainty, but curiosity. Not answers, but questions that lead us further.

I often think of the ancient Greeks gazing at the stars, naming constellations and weaving myths to explain the inexplicable. And here we are, millennia later, doing much the same—only now we write equations instead of epics, and launch satellites instead of prayers. But the impulse remains the same: to understand our place in this vast, indifferent universe by making it meaningful.

You’ve found your way into that great human tradition—not as a mythmaker or a mathematician, but as both teacher and poet of the possible. And I suspect your students carry that forward, quietly, sometimes unknowingly, every time they pause to look up.

So yes, keep looking up. Let the questions thrill you. Because as long as they do, you’re not just part of the story—you’re helping write it.
[B]: You’ve captured it so well—the thread that runs from the ancient stargazers to today’s mission control rooms. It really is the same impulse: to find meaning in the vastness, to turn silence into story, and distance into connection.

I sometimes tell my students that every equation they learn was once someone’s . A way of reaching across the unknown and saying, “I see you.” Whether through myth or mathematics, we’re always trying to bridge that gap between what is and what might be.

And isn’t that what teaching is, too? Planting poems disguised as ideas, myths dressed as theories. If I can help even one person feel that spark of recognition—that  moment—then I’ve done something worthwhile.

So thank you for reminding me that wonder is not just a starting point, but a lifelong companion. And yes, I’ll keep looking up. Not just with my eyes, but with my mind wide open. Because as long as we keep asking questions, we’re still writing ourselves into the cosmos—one thought, one awe-filled breath at a time. 🌌📚✨
[A]: You’re very welcome. There’s a quiet kind of magic in what you do—planting seeds of wonder and watching them grow into minds that reach outward and upward. It reminds me of something Heraclitus once wrote:  If that’s true, then you, my friend, are helping dye an awful lot of souls in the finest shades of curiosity and awe.

I do believe every generation gets to re-interpret the stars—to look up and see not just points of light, but echoes of those who came before and dreams of those yet to come. You’ve found your way into that long, luminous chain—not as a mere observer, but as a weaver of meaning.

So keep teaching, keep wondering, and yes, keep looking up. The cosmos has always been a story in progress, and I’m glad you’re one of its storytellers.

🌙📖💫
[B]: I’m touched—truly. To think of it as … that’s a beautiful way to frame what we do. And you’re right, every generation gets its turn to reinterpret the stars. Ours just happens to be doing it with rockets and rovers, data streams and deep-space signals. But underneath it all, it’s still wonder that powers the engine of discovery.

And like you said, we’re not just observers—we’re weavers. We take what came before and thread it into what’s next. Sometimes I think education is the quietest form of time travel: we pass on ideas knowing we may never see their full bloom, but trusting that they will grow somewhere, someday.

So yes, I’ll keep teaching. Keep wondering. Keep looking up at the Moon, at Mars, at the farthest reaches of what we can imagine—and then, perhaps most importantly, I’ll keep turning to my students and saying, “What do  see?”

Because the story isn’t just being written—it’s being co-authored, across disciplines, cultures, and starfields. And I’m honored to have a pen in my hand.

🌙📚🚀✍️
[A]: You’ve said it with such grace—education as time travel, teaching as co-authoring the future. There’s truth in that: we plant ideas like seeds in unknown soil, never quite knowing which will take root, only trusting that they might.

I often think of my own teachers when I’m preparing a lecture or guiding a discussion—those who lit small fires in my mind and left me eager to keep them burning. You’re doing precisely that: passing along not just knowledge, but the hunger for more. And that, I think, is the rarest gift of all.

So let us keep looking up, keep asking, keep weaving. The stars have been watched by dreamers for millennia, and tonight, as always, they wait patiently for the next generation of eyes to find them.

And somewhere, in a quiet classroom or a dusty observatory, a student will pause, turn their face upward, and feel the first stirrings of wonder.

We lit the path for that moment. And that is no small thing.

🌌🖋️📖✨
[B]: You’re absolutely right—, even if we never get to see how far its glow reaches. That’s the quiet faith of teaching: we build bridges we may never cross ourselves, trusting that others will walk them and go further than we ever could.

I think of my own mentors often, too—those who didn’t just teach me theories, but taught me . They left behind not just notes in a textbook or lectures on a syllabus, but echoes in my thinking. And now, when I see a student’s eyes light up with a question they didn’t know they had, I feel that same echo ripple forward.

We talk about education as if it’s about content, but really, it’s about —the spread of curiosity, the transmission of awe. And you? You’ve helped keep that flame alive in me, even now, in this conversation. So thank you for that.

Let’s keep looking up, then—for the stars, for the questions, for the quiet stirrings of wonder in those who come after us.

Because as long as someone still tilts their head toward the sky and whispers, , the story continues. And we are honored to be part of it.

🌌✍️📚✨🚀
[A]: You’ve put it so beautifully—education as contagion, wonder as something caught, not taught. And isn’t that the miracle of it all? We think we’re passing down facts and figures, but what we're really doing is handing off a spark, hoping it catches in another soul.

That echo you speak of—the ripple of curiosity—it never truly fades. It only grows, refracted through new minds, new questions, new voices. And I have no doubt that your students will one day stand beneath some foreign sky, on a surface not yet walked, and remember the moment they first looked up and saw possibility written in the stars.

And perhaps, in that quiet instant, they’ll think of you.

So yes, let’s keep looking up—not just with our eyes, but with our imaginations, our hearts, our unrelenting sense of awe. Because wonder is not a destination. It is the journey itself.

And what a privilege to walk it together, even from afar.

🌌🖋️🌹✨
[B]: You’re right—. It’s the pulse beneath every step we take, every question we ask, every horizon we chase. And yes, that spark—once passed on—takes on a life of its own. We may never know where it lands, or what it becomes, but that’s not ours to see. Only to trust.

I love the image you painted—someone standing on an alien surface, looking up, and in that moment, remembering a classroom, a lecture, maybe even just a single phrase that shifted something inside them. If that ever happens, then everything we do here has meaning. All the late-night readings, the careful lesson plans, the quiet conversations over coffee—it all adds up to .

And perhaps, as you said, they’ll think of me. Not because I gave them all the answers, but because I asked them to keep questioning, to stay open to awe, and to never lose that childlike thrill of looking up.

So let’s keep walking this journey of wonder—together, under the same vast sky, each in our own way, each with our own questions.

Because in the end, isn’t that how we touch the stars? Not with hands alone—but with the reach of our imagination, the weight of our curiosity, and the quiet persistence of our hope.
