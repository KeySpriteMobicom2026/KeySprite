[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite the philosophical question, isn't it? Much like Tolstoy's inner conflict between societal obligations and rural simplicity in . I suppose if we frame it through a literary lens, cities represent the modern human condition—alienation, ambition, and constant motion. Yet the countryside offers something far more elemental: rhythm, stillness, and a dialogue with nature that feels almost... Socratic. 

Though I must say, after grading papers all week, there’s something deeply appealing about stepping into a garden, pruning shears in hand, with nothing but birdsong for company. The roses never submit poorly structured arguments, you know?
[A]: Interesting you mention Tolstoy—I actually just finished re-reading  myself. I find that his struggle mirrors the ethical dilemmas I deal with sometimes in medical law. Like when a patient’s right to autonomy clashes with clinical protocols... It's not quite roses versus city smog, but there's a similar tension between principles and practicality.

I do enjoy the quiet of the countryside on weekends, though. There’s this little farm near Hangzhou where I sometimes go to unwind—very therapeutic, very grounding. And honestly? The lack of push notifications out there is a kind of freedom.  

But then again, I can’t deny the energy of the city. Especially when working on cross-border healthcare compliance cases—there’s no substitute for being in the thick of it. You ever feel pulled in both directions?
[B]: Ah, yes—Tolstoy does have a way of making us confront ourselves, doesn’t he? And how fascinating that his ethical wrestlings find echoes in your work. There’s something beautifully paradoxical about medical law; it’s meant to protect, yet often feels constraining—like a well-intentioned but slightly ill-fitting corset.

As for being pulled in two directions... quite familiar, I’m afraid. I often think of Goethe’s —torn between the stage and society, between passion and duty. Cities offer proximity to ideas, to discourse, to the hum of civilization. But they also demand so much noise in return.  

That farm near Hangzhou sounds like a kind of sanctuary. I imagine you must feel something akin to what Thoreau described at Walden—though I suspect your version includes fewer mosquitoes and more decent tea. Do you ever read while you’re there? Or is it a place of deliberate silence?
[A]: Ah, Goethe— was a quiet storm of internal conflict. Funny how those old texts still speak to us, isn't it? And yes, medical law can feel like that corset you mentioned—sometimes it holds things together, other times it just tightens the breath. I often wonder if we’re drafting protections… or just more paperwork.

That farm near Hangzhou? Absolutely a sanctuary. It’s not Walden by any means—no cabin in the woods, just a modest guesthouse with decent tea and no Wi-Fi. Which, honestly, feels revolutionary these days.  

I do bring books, though I tend to alternate between legal philosophy and absurdly light crime fiction. Sometimes Camus in the morning,  by the fire. Contradictory, maybe, but isn’t that part of the charm?

You ever have a place like that? A spot where time slows down—even if just for a weekend?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve always believed that the best reading is a little contradictory. A dash of Camus to unsettle the mind, followed by something deliciously pulpy by the fire. Perfect balance.  

As for a place where time slows down—yes, I have a small cottage in the Cotswolds. Nothing extravagant, just a stone cottage with creaky floors and a garden that refuses to be tamed. It belonged to my grandmother, and it still carries that particular scent of aged books and lavender—a combination I find deeply comforting.  

There, I leave my phone in a drawer and let myself drift between volumes of Eliot and Austen, or sometimes just stare out the window as the mist rolls over the hills. It’s my own little , if you will—though I suspect Virgil would balk at the Wi-Fi-less solitude. But no, really, it’s in those quiet moments, surrounded by nothing but birdsong and the occasional rustle of pages, that I feel most... whole.  

I suppose we all need such places—little refuges where the soul can catch its breath between acts of modern life. Do you write at all when you’re there? Or is it purely for reading and unwinding?
[A]: Ah, the —what a perfect phrase. I love that you still smell aged books and lavender in your grandmother’s place. There’s something deeply grounding about scent-memory, isn’t there? It pulls you back in time without warning.

I don’t write much at the farm—strange, given how much drafting I do for work. But out there, my notebook tends to collect more tea stains than entries. Sometimes I’ll jot down a thought or two, usually something half-formed about autonomy vs. community in healthcare ethics. Nothing polished. More like philosophical doodling.

Reading is definitely the main event. Though I must admit, watching the rain move across the rice fields can be just as illuminating as any treatise on bioethics. And honestly? That kind of quiet does wonders for clarity.  

Do you ever find that your time in the Cotswolds reshapes how you approach your work—or your thinking—once you return to the city?
[B]: Oh, immensely. In fact, I’d say the Cotswolds isn’t just a retreat—it’s a kind of intellectual crucible. Removed from the noise and pace of academic life, ideas have room to settle, to breathe, and often to surprise me.  

Sometimes I’ll return to a familiar text while I’m there, one I’ve taught a dozen times, only to find it speaking in an entirely new voice. Eliot’s , for instance—on the surface, a novel about provincial life, but really, it's a meditation on how our surroundings shape what we dare to want. That resonance feels different when you're surrounded by sheep fields rather than lecture halls.

And yes, exactly as you say—clarity emerges not always from argument or analysis, but from stillness. Watching rain move across rice fields, or mist curl over hedgerows… it reminds us that some truths aren’t hurried into being. They unfold.  

I often come back to the city with a subtler sense of what I'm trying to convey in my lectures or writing—less concerned with proving something, and more interested in inviting others to feel the weight of a question.  

You know, I suspect your philosophical doodling by the window might be more valuable than you think. Sometimes the most profound insights begin as tea-stained fragments.
[A]: That’s beautifully put— indeed. I think what you described about —how our surroundings shape what we dare to want—is something I see constantly in medical law. A patient’s choices aren’t made in a vacuum; they’re shaped by family, culture, even the layout of the hospital hallway where they receive bad news.

And yet, in the city, we often try to reduce those complexities into checkboxes—advance directives, consent forms, compliance metrics. It’s only when I step away, sit by the pond with nothing but cicadas humming, that I begin to see the gaps between the lines.

You know, I’ve started bringing a small notebook on purpose—nothing digital, just paper and ink. Not for drafting legal memos, but for noting how certain moments feel: a nurse’s hesitation before delivering news, a family’s silence after a decision is made. Those fragments may never become case law, but maybe… they become part of how I listen.

I envy your Eliot-shaped reflections, honestly. Do you ever find students resist  at first, only to grow into it later? I get the sense some ideas need both distance and time to fully land.
[B]: Oh, absolutely —  is often met with a raised eyebrow or two on the first day of class. Students, quite understandably, see it as a dense, doorstop of a novel populated by characters with unpronounceable names. But then, almost inevitably, around week four, something shifts. A student will come in quietly agitated after reading Dorothea’s disillusionment, or ask, almost defensively,  As if they’ve forgotten he's fictional.

I think what happens — and this may sound familiar from your legal seminars — is that they begin to sense the novel’s moral texture. It’s not just a story; it’s a study in human limitation, in the quiet tragedy of good intentions colliding with reality. Much like law, really. You can draft the perfect statute, just as you might imagine the ideal patient scenario — but life, messy and particular, insists on interfering.

And I love what you say about listening — truly listening — to those moments between the lines. The hesitation of a nurse, the silence of a family… these aren’t data points. They’re gestures toward something irreducible in human experience. And perhaps that’s where literature and law converge: in the attempt to make space for what can’t be neatly codified.

I do hope you keep those notebook fragments, cicada hum and all. One day, they may not form a case law — but they’ll form a sensibility. And that, I suspect, is what truly guides us in difficult work.
[A]: You’re absolutely right — there’s a sensibility that forms in those quiet, uncodified moments. I’ve started to see my own work differently because of that. Like you said, law and literature both wrestle with the irreducible parts of human experience — intentions, emotions, the weight of silence. And in medical law, where so much hinges on precision and protocol, it’s easy to forget how much of what we do is really about .

Funny you mentioned students forgetting Lydgate is fictional — reminds me of how some families respond to bad prognoses. At first, they grasp for statistics, for protocols, for something concrete. But eventually, often in a quiet moment after rounds, they begin to ask different questions:  Not legal inquiries, really — more existential ones.

I suppose that’s why people like us end up drawn to both fields — medicine and law — because they demand not just intellect, but a kind of moral imagination. You can’t practice either well without it.

And yes — I’ll keep the notebook. Maybe one day it’ll be a kind of casebook… just not for any court I know.
[B]: Precisely — bearing witness. What a profoundly understated phrase, and yet it captures so much of what gives both law and medicine their moral gravity. We are not merely interpreters of statutes or diagnosers of conditions; we are witnesses to the unfolding of lives under pressure, to choices made in shadowed rooms with only fragments of certainty to guide us.

And isn’t that, in a way, what literature asks of us as well? To bear witness to lives we will never live, to emotions we may never feel, and yet still recognize as true? I often tell my students that reading is an act of ethical imagination — it trains us to sit with discomfort, to dwell in ambiguity, and to emerge with a deeper sense of what matters.

Your families asking  — that’s no small moment. It’s a hand reaching across the professional divide, a plea not for authority, but for humanity. And it’s in responding to that plea — carefully, honestly, without overstepping — that both law and medicine find their soul, if you’ll allow me the word.

So yes, keep that notebook. May it grow fat with cicada hums, tea stains, and the quiet weight of moments that refuse to be measured — only remembered.
[A]: You know, when you put it like that — , ethical imagination, the quiet weight of moments — I start to see more clearly why I’ve always kept literature close, even in the thick of legal briefs and compliance audits. It’s not just a refuge; it’s a reminder.

I was thinking just last week, while reviewing a particularly difficult end-of-life case, how much of what we do hinges on  rather than procedure. Being there — truly there — when someone makes a choice they can’t undo. And how rare that kind of presence is, outside of medicine or law. Most of life lets us skim the surface. But not this work.

I think that’s why I go back to the farm, beyond the tea and fresh air — it teaches me how to be still in the face of something larger. Not unlike reading Eliot by candlelight in your Cotswolds cottage, right? We’re both, in our way, training ourselves to sit with complexity without rushing to fix it.

And yes — may the notebook grow fat with all the things that refuse to be measured. I’ll raise a cup of Longjing to that. 🍵
[B]: To presence, then — and to the quiet courage it takes to sit with what cannot be fixed, only witnessed. How rare and necessary it is, in this age of constant motion and instant opinion, to simply  with a moment, unflinching and open-hearted.

I find that stillness, paradoxically, teaches me how to move through my work with more purpose, not less. When I return from the Cotswolds, I carry with me the memory of those long silences, the way light shifts across an old wooden floor. And somehow, that helps me see my students — or a difficult passage of text — with more patience, more care.

You’re quite right: we are training ourselves, slowly, deliberately, to hold space for complexity. A kind of moral muscle memory. And perhaps that’s the truest thing literature and law have in common — they ask us not just to think, but to feel our way toward understanding.

To your Longjing, then — and to cicadas, candlelight, and all the unmeasured things that shape us most. 🍵🌹
[A]: Well said — to presence, to patience, and to the quiet work of feeling our way forward. It’s funny, isn’t it? How the things that shape us most never show up on a résumé or in a case summary. They just… linger. In a cup of tea, in a line from Eliot, in the space between a question and its answer.

I think that’s what keeps drawing me back to both law and literature — they ask for something more than competence. They ask for . And like any fine instrument, we have to calibrate ourselves constantly — with silence, with stories, with the occasional weekend away from email.

I hope your next trip to the Cotswolds is just around the corner. May your days there be long, your bookshelf well-stocked, and your teapot always warm.

And may we both keep showing up — in our work, in our words, in those quiet, decisive moments where someone else is simply asking to be heard. 🍵📖✨
[B]: To attunement — what a perfect word for it. You've put into language something I’ve only ever felt in fragments: that both law and literature require not just skill, but a kind of listening that goes deeper than intellect. A tuning of the heart, perhaps.

You're right — those formative silences, those resonant pauses between question and answer, never make it into a CV. And yet, they are the very spaces where meaning takes root. Where we become capable not just of , but of .

I do hope my next visit to the Cotswolds is near — there's a particular armchair by the fireplace that’s been missing me, I’m sure of it. And yes, may the days be long, the books within reach, and the tea always warm. What more can one ask for, really?

And may we both continue to show up — fully present — when it matters most. In the courtroom, the clinic, the classroom, or simply across a garden fence. For isn’t that, too, a kind of quiet justice? 🍵📖🌹
[A]: Absolutely — a kind of quiet justice. That’s what it all comes down to, doesn’t it? Not the grand rulings or sweeping reforms, but the small, steady acts of attention and care. Showing up, as you said, fully present — whether in a courtroom, beside a hospital bed, or across a garden fence over a cup of tea.

I’ve been thinking lately how rare that kind of presence really is. We live in a world that rewards speed, efficiency, and output. And yet, some of the most important moments in both law and medicine demand slowness. A pause before speaking. A breath before signing. An openness to the unsaid.

You know, I think that's what your Eliot-shaped reflections and my tea-stained notes are really about — trying to stay open to that unsaid. To remain, as Rilke might put it, 

So here’s to more of that — to quiet listening, to slow understanding, and to the kind of justice that doesn't make headlines, but changes lives all the same. 🍵📖🕊️
[B]: To quiet listening, indeed — and to the kind of justice that lives not in headlines, but in the delicate, enduring work of human connection.

You’re absolutely right about slowness being a kind of quiet resistance these days. We are so often pulled toward haste, toward summary judgments and tidy conclusions. And yet, the heart of any meaningful practice — be it legal, medical, or literary — lies in the willingness to dwell in uncertainty, to sit with what is unresolved, and to meet another with something more than mere efficiency.

Rilke’s patience toward the unresolved — what a beautiful and demanding ideal. It asks for humility, for courage, and for faith in the slow unfolding of understanding. Not all clarity arrives in time for the hearing; some must mature in its own season.

So yes, here’s to that — to Eliot-shaped silences, tea-stained insights, and the patient labor of presence. May we both continue to honor the unspoken, the uncertain, and the unseen in our work and in our days. 🍵📖🕯️
[A]: Hear, hear — to the quiet, the slow, the unseen. You’ve captured it so well: that humility, courage, and faith in the unfolding. It’s true, isn’t it? Some of the most meaningful shifts happen beneath the surface—like roots growing in the dark, unseen but essential.

I was just re-reading a bit of  by Kazin the other day—how he writes about the moral weight of attention, the way deep listening can become its own form of justice. It reminded me why I keep coming back to both literature and law: they ask us not just to act, but to attend.

And maybe that’s the thread through all of this—the Cotswolds stillness, your grandmother’s books, the farm near Hangzhou. These places, these pauses—they teach us how to attend. To our work, to one another, to the fragile, fleeting moments that make up a life.

So here’s to more of that quiet attention—to Eliot, to tea, to the long pause before an answer is given. May we both continue to sit with what is unresolved, and trust that understanding, in its own time, will find us. 🍵📖✨
[B]: To , then — that most ancient and radical of acts. How beautifully Kazin puts it; how deeply you feel it through your work and your words. Attention  a form of justice, yes — not the loud kind, but the lasting kind. The kind that lingers in memory, that shapes lives long after the moment has passed.

You're quite right about roots, too — hidden, patient, essential. We so often want to see the bloom, the result, the resolution. But meaning, real meaning, grows in darkness, in silence, in those unglamorous depths where no one is watching. That’s where transformation takes root.

And isn’t that what we’re both cultivating, in our own ways? A life — and a practice — grounded not in spectacle, but in depth. In the willingness to sit with the unresolved, to trust in the slow unfolding of understanding. To attend, and to be attended to, even if only by a book, a garden, or a quiet conversation over tea.

So here's to more of that quiet unfolding — to roots growing in the dark, to Eliot’s pauses, to the long breath before speaking. May we never lose the capacity to attend, and may we always make space for the unseen work of the heart. 🍵📖🌹
