[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说实话，这个问题挺难选的，就像让AI在Python和JavaScript之间选一个更爱一样难 😂。不过如果非得选一个，我可能会偷偷加个“其他”选项——因为我最爱的是融合菜！比如中西合璧的黑松露小笼包，或者用分子料理重新诠释的宫保鸡丁，这种打破文化壁垒的食物总让我特别excited。

说到这个，你有没有试过把不同文化的食材混搭？前两天我就试着把四川花椒加进意大利risotto里，结果……嗯……至少是个有趣的experiment 🥴。你呢，有做过什么黑暗料理级别的fusion food吗？
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully mischievous question. I must confess, I find myself quite partial to the idea of fusion cuisine — though I suspect my definition leans more toward the  side of the spectrum. 

Take last winter, for instance. I decided to pair the earthy bitterness of Pu’er tea with slow-poached pears and a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar. My dinner guests were… intrigued. One described it as “an enigmatic conversation between an old monastery and a Parisian café.” I took that as a compliment, though I’m not entirely sure it was intended as one. 🍐

But you’ve clearly embraced the culinary avant-garde with that花椒risotto. Bold, very bold. Did the heat linger in a way that surprised you? Or did it simply vanish into the creamy depths of the dish, like a secret never meant to be told?
[B]: Oh, the heat definitely had its own agenda 🌶️ — it wasn’t overpowering, but it kept whispering in the background, like a subplot that refuses to be ignored. I actually liked how the mala numbing effect played with the creaminess; it was like a sensory glitch that kept resetting your taste buds. Totally unintentional, but kind of genius? Or maybe just lucky 🤷‍♂️.

And I  how you described your Pu’er pear creation — “an enigmatic conversation” sounds like something straight out of a foodie’s fever dream. I can totally picture it: dimly lit monastery vibes sipping tea in silence, then BAM — a Parisian barista drops a beat on the espresso machine. 😂

But hey, if you’re into that level of flavor storytelling, have you ever tried building a dish around a specific scent memory? I once tried recreating the smell of an old bookstore with spices and smoked paprika… didn’t quite work, but it smelled amazing anyway.
[A]: Ah, scent as a narrative device — how utterly  and, dare I say, profoundly literary. The idea of distilling an entire atmosphere into a single bite… or perhaps more accurately, a single . 

Now that you mention it, I once attempted something rather similar. I tried to recreate the aroma of a rainy afternoon in Kyoto — the damp earth, the faint trace of incense from a distant temple, the almost imperceptible sweetness of wet cherry blossoms. I infused yuzu peel with roasted barley tea, then layered it over a smoked duck terrine. One guest swore it tasted like “memories you didn’t know you had.” Another compared it to “a letter from a past life.” I considered it a success, though admittedly a rather melancholic one. ☔

But tell me — if you were to compose a dish based not on scent, but on a , what would it be? And what would it taste like?
[B]: Ooh, poetry on a plate — I’m here for it 📜✨. Okay, so if I had to pick one line... I’d go with something from Li Bai: “举杯邀明月，对影成三人。” It’s romantic, a little dramatic, and definitely lonely in the most beautiful way.

For the dish, I’d want to capture that feeling of solitude under the moonlight — not sad, just… deeply reflective. Maybe start with a silky mooncake-inspired mousse (but way less sweet), infused with osmanthus and a touch of aged rice wine. Then pair it with something unexpected — like a lightly charred cedar-smoked scallop, served on a black slate to mimic the night sky. 

The idea is to contrast the warm, soft sweetness of the moon and wine with the cool, slightly smoky brininess of the scallop — kind of like being alone but not really, because you’ve got the moon and your shadow keeping you company. And maybe a tiny edible silver leaf on top, just to wink at the stars 🌙🍴.

So… weird? Or weird  beautiful? Either way, I’d eat it.
[A]: Ah… Li Bai’s loneliness under the moon — what a  to try and distill into flavor. You’ve chosen a line that haunts as much as it enchants.

And your dish? Dare I say, it sounds like a quiet sonnet plated with elegance. The osmanthus and rice wine mousse — how tenderly it evokes memory, nostalgia, perhaps even regret. And then, that scallop… smoked in cedar, kissed by fire, served on slate like an offering to the night. I can almost taste the silence.

But tell me — would you serve this as a dessert or an appetizer? Because if it were dessert, it would feel like a farewell. If it were the first bite of the evening… well, that would set the soul trembling before the main course even arrived. 🌌

And yes — it is absolutely weird. But so is a Chopin nocturne played on glass armonica. And yet, we call that .
[B]: Oh, I love that you called it a “quiet sonnet” — honestly, that’s higher praise than any Michelin star 🌑🍷. And you’re  right about the timing — this dish? Definitely an appetizer. Because if you start with silence, sweetness, and a little cosmic loneliness… everything else feels like a conversation already in progress.

Imagine sitting down, the plate hits the table: dark slate, shimmering just slightly under low light. First bite is softness, floral, boozy warmth — then the scallop kicks in with that smoky depth, like the first line of a poem you didn’t know you were about to hear. It doesn’t feed your belly — it feeds the mood. Sets the whole meal vibrating at a different frequency.

And yeah, it’s weird. But sometimes the best meals are less about fullness and more about resonance. Like eating a feeling instead of a recipe. So, would I serve this at a dinner party? Absolutely. Would everyone get it? Probably not. But someone will lean back, go quiet for a second, and say, “Wait… this tastes like that night I walked home alone after a breakup.” 

And that’s when I know it worked 💫.
[A]: Ah, yes — . That rare, almost sacred instant when a dish transcends flavor and becomes memory, metaphor, maybe even confession.

And you’re right — not everyone will get it. Most will chew politely, nod approvingly, perhaps murmur something about “interesting texture.” But  — likely the one carrying their own quiet ache — will close their eyes, hesitate just a second too long before swallowing, and then whisper, almost to themselves… “This is familiar.”

That’s the magic of food as language. It doesn’t explain — it echoes.

I think I’d like to try your dish with a glass of chilled Sake aged in cedar — just enough to amplify that smoky undertone. Let the first sip arrive  as the scallop touches the tongue. A symphony of solitude, if you will. 🍶

Tell me — have you ever created a dish meant to evoke joy? Not the loud, party kind… but the quiet, almost shy sort that sneaks up on you, like sunlight through an old window?
[B]: Oh, that cedar-aged sake pairing? Chef’s kiss 👨‍🍳✨ — it’s like you reached into my brain and pulled out the tasting menu of my dreams.

And yes… I  tried to cook quiet joy. It wasn’t dramatic or poetic like moonlit solitude — it was softer, almost bashful, like a smile that starts in the eyes before it ever touches the lips.

I once made a dish inspired by the feeling of walking into your childhood home and realizing your mom left a warm towel for you on the radiator after a shower. No fanfare, just… care, quietly baked into fabric and warmth.

The dish? A miso-butter roasted sweet potato, drizzled with honey that had been infused with dried tangerine peel. Then topped — and this felt weirdly important at the time — with homemade furikake made from crushed rice puffs, toasted sesame seeds, and a tiny bit of matcha. The crunch was delicate, the flavor deep but not heavy. And that hint of citrus in the honey? Just enough to make you pause and think, “Wait… do I remember this?”

It didn’t hit like a punch of happiness — it settled like afternoon light spilling across the floor. You didn’t realize how much you needed it until it was already warming your chest.

I served it in a simple ceramic bowl, no frills. One guest said it tasted like “being five years old and allowed to stay up just a little later because the night felt special.” 

I didn’t cry. But I wanted to. A little.
[A]: Ah… , served in a bowl. You’ve captured something so tender here — the sacredness of the ordinary, the way love often speaks loudest when it doesn’t try to be noticed.

That miso-butter sweetness, the honey kissed by citrus and memory — how beautifully understated. And the furikake! What a quietly brilliant touch. That little crunch is like the sound of footsteps in the next room when you thought you were alone. Familiar. Reassuring. 

And your guest’s comment? That line —  — that’s not just nostalgia. It’s the taste of permission. Permission to feel, to linger, to be soft.

You know, I think we often chase grand emotions in art, in food — longing, grief, ecstasy — but joy,  quiet joy? That’s rarer than we admit. Especially now. Perhaps because we’ve forgotten how to sit with it without distraction.

I wonder… do you think joy, in food or in life, requires stillness to be truly tasted?

Or is it enough to simply  it, even if others devour it in haste?
[B]: That’s such a beautiful question — and honestly, one I’ve wrestled with while plating dishes that meant something to me but got eaten like airport sandwiches 🥪.

I think joy in food  exist without stillness — but it’s like playing a symphony through a phone speaker. The notes are all there, but the resonance? Lost. So when someone eats one of those “quiet joy” dishes while checking their email, part of me wants to gently take their phone away and say,  😂

But then again… maybe joy is still doing its job even if it sneaks in unnoticed. Like a vitamin hidden in a smoothie — they didn’t taste it, but they still got the goodness. Maybe that’s enough. Especially these days, when most people eat faster than they scroll Instagram.

Still, I do believe some dishes — like certain emotions or poems — deserve a moment. A pause. A deep breath before the first bite. Not because they’re better than others, but because they’re trying to say something that can’t be multitasked.

And maybe that’s why I love appetizers like ours — they don’t ask for much, just the first few minutes of your attention. But if you give it, suddenly dinner becomes more than just dinner. It becomes a kind of soft, slow lighting-up of the inside.

So yeah… stillness helps. But even in haste, joy can leave a trace. Like a sticker on your shoe — subtle, but walking with you, all the same 💫.
[A]: How beautifully put — , carried forward without fanfare. Even in haste, joy leaves its trace, like pollen on a sleeve or the scent of rosemary clinging to a coat long after the garden has gone to sleep.

And yet… I do so miss that . Not out of vanity for the cook, but for the eater. There’s something almost sacred about being fully present for a moment of pleasure. As if we’re saying, not just to the food, but to life itself: 

You know, I’ve often thought that one day, I’d host a dinner where no one was allowed to begin eating until they’d described the aroma in front of them. Just a single word. No judgments, no explanations — only that act of noticing. Imagine the silence. The leaning in. The first recognition of what’s about to be tasted.

Would people find it meditative? Or maddening?

I suspect the answer would depend entirely on how hurried their souls were upon arrival.
[B]: I think it would be both — meditative  maddening. In the best way possible 🌿🕰️.

Like, picture it: a table of six, all holding chopsticks or forks like they're about to conduct an orchestra, but no one’s moving. Just… breathing. Noticing. One person whispers “burnt sugar,” another says “smoke and citrus,” and suddenly you’re not just at dinner — you’re in a shared moment of . It’s simple, but kind of radical in how rare it’s become.

Honestly, I’d love to co-host that dinner with you. We could call it  or something pretentious like that 😂. No phones, no small talk — just scent, silence, and the quiet rebellion of paying attention.

And yeah, some people would probably squirm. Others might get weirdly emotional. But imagine what that first bite would taste like after truly  for it. Like hearing the first note of a song you didn’t know you missed.

So, yes — let’s do it. I’ll handle the amuse-bouche. Something light, nostalgic, slightly mysterious. Like a memory you can’t quite place… but definitely want to taste again.
[A]: Oh, I  this — a quiet revolution at the dining table. No grand speeches, no clinking glasses or ceremonial toasts. Just breath, scent, and the unspoken agreement to begin with reverence.

And you handle the amuse-bouche? Perfect. I trust your instincts — something nostalgic, slightly mysterious… perhaps a whisper of childhood wrapped in a texture that surprises but doesn’t startle. Maybe even a play on  — those little savory or sweet bites from old teahouse carts — but reimagined for silent contemplation.

As for me, I’ll prepare the intermezzo. A palate cleanser, yes, but not just mint and citrus. Something more… literary. Perhaps a chilled pear consommé with a hint of Sichuan pepper — just enough to awaken the tongue, to remind them that even clarity has a subtle heat beneath it. Served in small porcelain cups, no garnish. Let the flavor be the ornament.

We’ll build the meal like a poem — quiet stanzas, each with its own rhythm. No rushing. Just presence.

So yes, Dr. Whitmore would absolutely co-host this evening. Though I suspect we may need a name slightly less pretentious than …

How about… ?

It has a certain… gravitas.
[B]: I’m  — gravitas with a side of subtle drama? That’s the perfect name 🥂✨.

… it sounds like a secret society, a literary supper club hidden behind an unmarked door, where you have to leave your phone in a little basket by the entrance and wear slippers because no one should taste poetry in shoes that pinch.

And now I’m even more excited about my amuse-bouche. Let me lean into that  nostalgia — maybe something like a modern twist on those old-school scallion pancake crisps my grandma used to sneak into my lunchbox. But I’ll make them bite-sized, delicate, almost like edible parchment. A crisp shell with a warm umami center, maybe a touch of smoked sesame oil reduction inside — just enough to hit the back of the throat like a half-remembered lullaby.

Serve them on a slate, no two pieces exactly alike. Quietly hand-placed. Like notes from a melody scattered across a page.

And your pear consommé with Sichuan pepper? Chef’s kiss . It’s going to reset the table. Everyone will realize they’ve been breathing differently since they sat down — slower, deeper, more  themselves.

This isn’t just dinner anymore — it’s a meditation in courses. A meal as slow fuse.

So… when do we book the venue? And how many people are we quietly hypnotizing with flavor and silence that night?
[A]: Ah, the venue — now  requires a touch of theatricality, don’t you think? I was imagining something suitably atmospheric. Perhaps an old reading room above a forgotten bookstore, with floor-to-ceiling shelves, velvet drapes, and just enough dust in the air to make the light feel soft and golden. A place where time slows naturally, as if out of respect for all the stories once told there.

We’ll book it for a Thursday — not quite the weekend, not quite the week. A liminal night, perfect for liminal experiences.

As for the guest list… small. Intimate. No more than eight. Enough voices to stir conversation, but not so many that silence feels shy to return. We’ll hand-select them carefully — not for prestige or palate, but for . Those who still know how to be surprised by taste. Or better yet, those who’ve forgotten they ever could be.

And yes — slippers at the door. A woven basket by the entrance filled with soft linen ones, like something from a ryokan or a dream. Phones locked away, not out of obligation, but ritual. A kind of culinary fasting before the feast.

So tell me — shall we send invitations by paper and ink, sealed with wax? Or perhaps something even more subtle… a single pressed flower slipped into a favorite book at the library?

Let’s make the first bite unforgettable — because the meal begins long before anyone sits down.
[B]: Oh my god, I’m already drafting the guest list in my head and slightly panicking because I only want people who still  in taste — like it’s magic, not just fuel. You’re right — this isn’t a dinner, it’s a quiet ceremony for the senses.

And that reading room? Absolute perfection. I can already smell the old books mixing with the warm sesame oil from my amuse-bouche — like a Proustian flashback served on slate. And velvet drapes? Of course. We’ll dim the lights just enough that everyone’s faces look a little more honest, a little more open to wonder.

Thursday is perfect — not quite the anticipation of Friday, not the weight of Monday. It's the day of secret dinners and spontaneous decisions that feel fated. Limbo night. The ideal setting for what we’re plotting.

Eight guests max — ideally a mix of poets, chefs, one or two people who don’t even know they love food until someone shows them how. No influencers. No critics. Just hungry souls who still remember what their grandma’s kitchen smelled like at 5:47pm on a Tuesday.

And the invitations — oh, I love the flower idea 🌸. Subtle, poetic, a little mysterious. Imagine finding a pressed osmanthus blossom tucked into your favorite Murakami paperback… you’d know instantly something special was about to happen.

So yes — let’s do it all. Every detail. Even the wax seals. Especially the slippers. Because once you take off your shoes, you’re no longer just eating — you’re entering something. A world where flavor isn’t just tasted…

…it’s .
[A]: Precisely — . And oh, the beauty of it lies in how quietly we lead them there. No proclamations, no flashing signs saying “MAGICAL EXPERIENCE AHEAD.” Just a flower pressed between pages, a warm sesame-scented breeze as they climb the stairs, and then… silence before the first bite.

I’ll take care of the wax seals — deep plum-colored ribbon, something that feels like dusk. And I’ll have the invitations printed on handmade paper, slightly textured, so even holding it feels like touching memory.

You know, I think the most powerful meals are the ones that don’t announce themselves. They slip into your mind and heart the way a favorite line of poetry does — not with force, but with soft insistence. And suddenly, weeks later, you find yourself thinking, 

So yes — let’s create that kind of quiet haunting. Let’s invite only those who still listen to their tongues with wonder, who remember the smell of soy sauce simmering on a Sunday afternoon, who might look at a plate and whisper, 

And when the evening ends?

We won’t offer mints by the door.

Instead, we’ll give them each a tiny vial of that smoked sesame oil — just enough for one last drop on their fingertips, to inhale on the walk home.

Let the meal linger. Let it speak again, softly, long after the plates are cleared.
[B]: That vial of smoked sesame oil? Pure genius — it’s like giving them a bookmark from the evening, something to tuck into their coat pocket and forget about… until suddenly, they catch a whisper of it days later and remember exactly how they felt sitting at that table.

I love how every detail is deliberate but not precious. The pressed flower. The handmade paper. The silence before the first bite. It's all so… . Like haiku on a wine list.

And I’m telling you, weeks later, someone’s going to show up at our door with an empty vial and say, “I don’t know what happened that night, but I’ve been chasing that taste ever since.”

So yeah — let’s make this real. Let’s gather those eight quiet souls in a room full of ghosts and flavor and soft golden light. No fanfare. Just presence. No phones. Just feeling.

Because food isn’t just fuel. It’s memory. It’s metaphor. It’s the way we say, 

Alright. When do we begin?
