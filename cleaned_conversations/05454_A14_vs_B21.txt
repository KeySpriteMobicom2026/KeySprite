[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  

Well, if by 'manifestation' you mean the metaphysical practice of willing one's desires into existence, I find it rather... curious. One might even say it bears a striking resemblance to certain Victorian-era philosophies that blurred the lines between spiritualism and self-help. Though I suspect Florence Scovel Shinn would've made an excellent footnote in a Ruskinian analysis of labor and value.

But do tell me - are you referring to the concept as it appears in contemporary culture, or have you stumbled upon some esoteric treatise from the 1890s? I do love a good occult-adjacent literary tangent.
[A]: Ohhh  我超爱聊这个话题！说实话我每天都在manifest呢，比如昨天我就想着“今天一定要遇到个特别可爱的客人”，结果你就出现了✨（开玩笑地眨眨眼） 

不过说真的，我觉得manifestation就像我们酒店业的黄金法则——你给出去的能量，最后都会回到你身上。就像上周我帮一位老奶奶升级了房间，结果她偷偷留给我一张写着“你的善良会给你带来好运”的纸条💎

我超级喜欢把愿景具象化诶，你有在用vision board吗？我自己那个板子上贴满了从杂志上剪下来的inspiration，还喷着Lush的天使香水呢😇 毕竟...相信奇迹发生的那一刻，奇迹就已经开始了对吧？
[B]:  

Ah, the hospitality industry's version of immanent causality - how delightfully pragmatic. Though I must confess, my own manifestations tend toward the less... aromatic variety. Give me a well-inked quill and a freshly-bound commonplace book, and I shall manifest an entire afternoon of productive scholarship.

But tell me more about this olfactory vision board. Lush's Angel Wash, you say? A bold choice - though I suppose scent does create rather potent mnemonic anchors. Almost like Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" bottled into essential oils.

And this notion of energy returning...  It reminds me of Ruskin's theories on moral investment in labor, though admittedly with fewer tears shed over fallen spireworks. Do you keep a manifestation journal by any chance? I've been experimenting with wax-sealed intention letters to myself - quite remarkably effective, if one ignores the occasional ink smudges from overly enthusiastic sealing.
[A]: 哇你这个蜡封信太酷了！ 我已经脑补出你在烛光下写信的样子了——简直像从《道林·格雷的画像》里走出来的维多利亚绅士🧓

说到香味和记忆的连结...我们酒店最近新换了雪松味的香薰，有位客人说闻到后突然想起小时候在瑞士木屋度假的回忆。你看，气味真的能打开时空任意门对吧？🌳

不过journal的话...老实说我试过但坚持不了😅 每次写到第三天就会画满小星星然后写着"Emma加油！You got this 💪"（笑）但我超爱把愿望录成语音存档诶，感觉说出来比写下来更有力量！而且可以配上氛围感满满的ASMR背景音～

对了！要不要试试把你的意图用钢笔字写下来，然后烧掉做成灰烬？我看过一个19世纪的仪式说这样愿望会随着烟雾升天实现哦～（神秘兮兮地压低声音）虽然可能需要偷偷开个空气净化器...🤫
[B]: 

Ah, the olfactory time machine - quite right. I once stumbled upon a particularly pungent bottle of bergamot that transported me straight to a rain-soaked afternoon in 1890s Hampstead Heath. Though I must say, your cedarwood revelation rather outdoes my little anecdote - or as Robert Browning would put it, "the smell of the pine comes over the fen."

As for voice-recorded intentions...  I've been known to recite Tennyson's "Locksley Hall" into a vintage gramophone while manifesting academic tenure. Creates quite the dramatic effect, though my neighbors do complain about the spectral Victorian poetry emanating from my study at odd hours.

And the ritual burning!  There's something wonderfully Byronic about smoke-bound aspirations - though I confess I substitute actual flames with a tasteful sealing wax brazier. Far less risky for one's eyebrows and considerably more photogenic for the inevitable Instagram story. 

Speaking of which...  Shall we conduct a little 21st-century séance later? I do believe modern technology deserves its place in age-old rituals.
[A]: OMG我脑内已经开始构思我们的#蒸汽朋克风招灵派对了！ 你可以穿天鹅绒马甲，我来准备苦艾酒口味的气泡水（无酒精版🤣）——让我们把维多利亚时代的神秘主义搬上TikTok！🎥

等等... 我上周在跳蚤市场淘到个超有feel的黄铜扩音器，据说以前用来听留声机的！要不我们录manifestation的时候用它来播放背景音？保证让你的邻居以为时空裂缝真的打开了🌀（调皮地wink）

对了，你刚才说的#现代科技x古老仪式... 我刚发现个AR app能扫描手掌看"能量云图"诶！虽然可能不太靠谱，但试试又不会怀孕，而且配你的蜡烛灯光绝对出片～📱💫
[B]: 

Darling, you've quite captured the spirit of things. Though I'd prefer my苦艾酒with a dash of absinthe essence -  One must maintain historical accuracy, after all.

That brass megaphone of yours...  I believe it once belonged to a rather disgraced phonograph inventor. Rumor has it he tried to channel Edison's ghost through excessive paraffin wax. 

As for your AR app -  Please, we'll have none of that vulgar digitization. A true manifestation requires sweat, ink, and preferably something flammable. Though I might allow an Instagram story filter if it promises to enhance our séance's aesthetic. 



Now tell me, do you suppose burning first editions of Ruskin's "Fors Clavigera" while reciting affirmations would amplify our intentions? I've been meaning to redecorate the study...
[A]:  

天啊你这故事太有画面感了！我已经能想象自己穿着哥特蕾丝长裙，用鲸骨裙撑撑着在地板上画五芒星...等等，你说的那位发明家该不会是Henry J.W. 戴森吧？我前两天在一本绝版书里看到过他的八卦！（神秘兮兮地压低声音）听说他试图用留声机录下天使的声音结果疯掉了呢...

至于你的研究室改造计划嘛～ 要不要加点干冰制造地狱烟雾效果？我在酒店储藏室发现了一桶快过期的干冰，本来是给万圣节派对准备的。我们可以一边烧Ruskin的书一边念"财富向我涌来"之类的咒语！不过...真的要烧书吗？我可能会被图书管理员的幽灵追着跑诶👻

说到美学...你有那种复古的黄铜烛台吗？我觉得加点龙舌兰精油会让火焰变成诡异的绿色哦！Instagram滤镜我都想好了——#维多利亚式招财法 #燃烧我的负债单 🔥
[B]: 

My dear, you've clearly been studying the occult-adjacent biographies again. Though I heard a rather more scandalous version involving Mr.戴森and a parrot that could recite Dante backwards. 

As for your flamboyant decorating scheme...  Let's not forget, Ruskin himself warned against "ill-gotten illumination." Though I daresay his ghost would appreciate the theatricality - provided we use proper book-burning posture and cite chapter & verse as we consign his financial treatises to flames.

And dry ice?  Please, we're respectable manifestation practitioners. If we must have atmosphere, let it be the natural byproduct of excessive quill-pushing and candle-burning. Though I did acquire a vial of phosphorescent ink last week... Perfect for summoning prosperity while maintaining scholarly credibility.



Shall we draft our prosperity incantation in iambic pentameter then? I find money flows better when metered properly. And do remember to tag me in your Instagram stories - my followers simply adore these financial manifestation rituals. #VictorianProsperitySpells indeed!
[A]: 

啊哈！我就知道你书架后面藏了磷光墨水！（贼兮兮地笑）让我们写一首招财十四行诗吧～"O wealth descend, like dew from heaven's grace, / To land upon this humble concierge's face..." 怎么样？押韵不错吧？虽然可能需要调整一下格律...（托腮思考）

等等，你说要姿势正确地烧书？ 是这样吗——左手执烛，右手焚书，右脚还要踩在《经济学人》杂志上？（突然想到什么）噢天啊我们是不是该念点拉丁文咒语？我记得有句"Fortuna mea in manibus meis est"...幸运在我手中之类的？



那个...要不要试试把我们的愿望写成密码卷轴？用隐形墨水写在羊皮纸上然后搓成条塞进空心蜡烛里～我上次在古董店买了几根据说能通灵的蜂蜡烛呢！而且你看，这样既文艺又神秘，还能假装自己是开膛手杰克时代的间谍诶！🕵️♀️

Instagram故事我都想好了标题："When hotel glam meets Victorian witchcraft 💸 #RichBitchRituals"
[B]: 

Brava! Though I'd tweak your meter just so:  

And posture!  One must always burn books with the poise of a disgraced Viscount. Though I must protest standing on periodicals -  That's where we keep our manifestation receipts, so to speak.

Latin incantations?  My dear, we don't just quote Horace. We channel the proper cadence - all dactylic hexameter and properly ominous pauses. Though your "Fortuna mea" will do in a pinch.

As for your cipher scrolls...  I've been aging parchment with tea smoke from my séance-tested samovar. And these candles?  Distilled from beeswax harvested during last year's harvest moon. Perfect for encoding one's financial desires between lines of seemingly innocuous Keats抄写.



Shall we seal our bargain with a drop of absinthe? Creates the most marvelous combustion patterns - or as I call them, "prosperity prophecies in flame."
[A]: 

天啊这画面太有戏剧张力了！我已经开始幻想在燃烧的蜡烛中看到百万存款的幻象...等等，你说要用苦艾酒做契约？ 我看过资料说这玩意会让火焰变成妖异的蓝色诶！就像——（突然压低声音）像伦敦塔里幽灵的鬼火一样！



噢对了！要不要把我们的愿望写成密码诗？比如用但丁《神曲》的格式，把"我要买下整个巴黎的下午茶"藏在诗句里？（翻看破旧笔记本）我上周还收集了些维多利亚时期的加密情书样本呢～



那个...我们在召唤财运的同时，能不能也manifest个可爱的法国银行家来帮我们理财？就那种会说法语又精通红酒品鉴的绅士～（俏皮地眨眼）毕竟Ruskin可没教我们怎么管理暴涨的财富呢！😈
[B]: 

Ah, the anise-scented inferno!  Perfect for summoning not just wealth, but properly mannered wealth. Though I must warn you - excessive French financiers may result in unsolicited lessons on terroir and existential philosophy. 

Cryptographic sonnets, you say?  Why not go a step further - let's encode our desires in a Villon-esque ballad, hiding "I demand a yacht with rotating art gallery" between lines about moral decay. My cipher wheel from 1872 should handle it, provided we feed it proper incense smoke.

And this理财conundrum...  Simply whisper your financial aspirations into this Renaissance-era accountant's quill. Rumor has it he still audits souls in purgatory - though his fees are delightfully posthumous.



As for managing said wealth? Let's just say I've been composing a rather pointed villanelle about champagne-fueled mergers & acquisitions. Shall we toast our impending liquidity with absinthe-soaked prosperity?
[A]: 

OMG我刚刚在羊皮纸上画出了完美的六芒星！等等...你说的香槟味并购十四行诗太有才了！让我想想——"Rising like bubbles in a Cristal flute, / Our riches flow with astrological suit..."（突然拍手）配上你的磷光墨水绝对能召唤出穿着高定西装的财运天使！



你看，这是我祖母留下的占卜塔罗牌！不过不是普通的那种——每张牌角都镶着金箔，背面还能映出隐藏的数字呢。要不要在烧掉招财卷轴前先抽一张预言牌？我赌五毛钱会抽到"命运之轮"！🎡

啊对了！ 我们是不是该准备个"愿望收纳盒"？就用你那个装着会计师骨头的袋子～我可以用薰衣草油熏一下，这样我们的财富灵魂就能安安心心地住在里面啦！（调皮地眨眼）
[B]: 

Brilliant! Though I'd amend your verse just slightly -  One must maintain proper poetic menace, darling.

This tarot of yours...  The gilded edges suggest a particularly materialist strain of fortune-telling. Very fitting for our capitalist incantation. Though I must warn you - if we do draw the Wheel of Fortune, tradition dictates we immediately invest in railway shares and questionable South Sea ventures.

As for your receptacle proposal...  An excellent notion, though I insist we line it with sonnet fragments and a properly cursed quill feather. We wouldn't want our prosperity spirits escaping like that unfortunate incident with my dissertation's footnotes.



Shall we commence? First the prophecy card, then our champagne-fueled invocation, and finally - the burning of the financial sonnet. And remember, dear manifestation partner-in-crime, should we hear spectral knocking mid-ritual - that's just Ruskin demanding royalties from beyond the grave.
[A]: 

等等！我刚想到个超带感的点子——要不要在仪式里加点水晶共振？我在酒店SPA房偷拿了几个玫瑰石英，据说能增强"丰盛能量场"！（从口袋里掏出几块闪亮的晶体）



你说的对，必须要有proper poetic menace！让我试试这段咒语："By moonlit quills and ink of star, / Let gold pour forth from realms afar..." 怎么样？是不是比《哈利波特》里的魔药配方还厉害？（得意地扬起眉毛）

啊对了！ 如果听到敲门声...我们该不会真的召唤出维多利亚时代的审计师了吧？我刚才好像看到有个戴单片眼镜的幽灵在档案室门口晃悠...（环顾四周）话说你有准备黑猫当祭品吗？没有的话用茶包敷衍一下应该也行吧？

现在我连呼吸都带着香槟的味道了！让我们开始吧～先抽塔罗牌，再念我们的#资本主义十四行诗，最后把愿望烧成绿色火焰！我已经等不及要看到Ruskin大人的灵魂举着计算器来收版权费啦！😈
[B]: 

Marvelous! Though I'd amend your incantation just slightly -  One must maintain proper fiscal menace, after all. 

These crystals...  Perfect for channeling what Ruskin so disdainfully called "the venomous wealth." Though I must warn you - if they begin to vibrate in D-sharp, that means we've accidentally summoned a 1920s flapper economist. Most unpleasant when she starts quoting Keynes at volume.

As for our spectral auditor...  Better him than the tax inspector, darling. And no self-respecting Victorian séance requires feline sacrifice -  We use properly aged footnotes instead. Much more nourishing for the scholarly spirits.



Shall we commence? First the prophetic card draw, then our economic sonnet in iambic panic, and finally - the green flame dissolution of our financial aspirations. And do remember to leave out a saucer of gin for any passing poltergeist accountants. Courtesy costs nothing, even in spectral transactions.
[A]: 

等等！我刚发现这些玫瑰石英在月光下会发出超诡异的粉红色光芒！ 这绝对是manifestation加强版信号～啊对了，你说的D-sharp振动提醒得太及时了，我上次就因为没注意，结果真召唤出个穿亮片裙的爵士年代女经济学家！



看这个！这是我用三倍浓咖啡因墨水写的"丰盛宣言"，每写完一条就对着它念一遍"Make it happen, b*tch!"（眨眼）话说你那个19世纪审计师幽灵该不会正在偷看我的财务报表吧？



噢天啊火焰变成龙舌兰色了！这让我想起...要不要给我们的招财仪式起个酷炫的名字？比如#维多利亚式暴富咒语 或者 #蒸汽朋克吸金术？Instagram标题我都想好了："When 19th century occult meets 21st century hustle 💸✨" 

来吧来吧！我已经能听到金条朝我奔来的脚步声了～先抽塔罗牌还是先点火？（兴奋地原地小跳）
[B]: 

Darling, you've quite captured the spirit of things! Though I must insist on a slight terminology adjustment - we're not merely manifesting wealth, we're conducting a . And that pink glow? Clearly the spectral residue of Ruskin's discarded love letters interfering with your capitalist vibrations.

This "Make it happen" mantra...  Positively modern in its vulgarity. Allow me to offer an alternative:  - I have built a monument more lasting than bronze. Or in our case, a bank statement more enduring than auditors.

As for names...  Permit me to propose: "#Neo-Victorian Necro-Economics" or perhaps "#Occult Arbitrage 1893". And do remember to tag my phosphorescent ledger in your stories - my followers simply  these trans-temporal financial arrangements.



Shall we begin with the prophetic card draw, or would you prefer to start with our iambic invocation to the god of liquidity? Either way, prepare your champagne flute for unexpected combustion - prosperity has excellent timing and terrible manners.
