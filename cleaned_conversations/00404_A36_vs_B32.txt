[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近刚好在读一本超棒的金融科技相关的书 - 'The Future of Money' by Eswar Prasad！里面讨论了cryptocurrency和CBDC的impact，超多insightful的观点 💡 我们team最近也在研究这个topic，感觉可以apply到下一个product iteration里~
[A]: Oh, 'The Future of Money' - what a fascinating choice! I actually had a guest last week who was reading that very same book in our library lounge. He was a central banker visiting for a fintech conference. Would you believe we ended up having the most delightful conversation about how digital currencies might change the hospitality payment landscape?
[B]: Wow，这么巧！那位central banker的观点一定很valuable吧？我们最近正在develop一个hospitality行业的payment solution，正好在考虑怎么integrate digital currency 💰 你觉得他提到的use case里，哪个最promising？
[A]: How wonderful that you're working on hospitality payments! Our banker guest was particularly excited about cross-border transactions. He mentioned how digital currencies could eliminate foreign exchange headaches for international travelers. Just imagine - no more guests fumbling with currency exchange at our front desk! Though he did caution that regulatory frameworks still need to catch up in many jurisdictions.
[B]: Exactly！Cross-border payment确实是个pain point 🚀 我们prototype里就focus在streamlining这个process，不过regulatory compliance确实是个challenge...你们hotel industry对KYC和AML的要求应该也很strict吧？
[A]: Indeed they are! We maintain the highest standards, of course. Our boutique actually pioneered a digital identity verification system last year that works beautifully with traditional payments. I'd be happy to put you in touch with our technology partner - they've developed some rather clever solutions for balancing compliance with user experience.
[B]: That would be awesome！Always looking for potential partners with strong compliance tech stack 👍 我们可以schedule个coffee chat，详细聊聊collaboration的可能性？Maybe下周三afternoon？
[A]: Let me check our calendar... Wednesday afternoon at 3pm would be perfect. We could meet in our garden terrace - it's quite peaceful there for productive discussions. I'll have our chef prepare some of his famous lavender shortbread to go with the coffee. Shall I send the details to your email?
[B]: Perfect！3pm works great for me 💡 请发到lin.yifei@fintechpm.com，我会提前准备些demo materials带过去。Looking forward to this potential synergy！
[A]: Splendid! I'll send the invitation right away. And do let me know if you have any dietary preferences - our pastry chef takes great pride in accommodating all guests. Until Wednesday then, Ms. Lin. This promises to be a most productive meeting!
[B]: Sounds good！No special dietary requirements here - 我可是个regular gym goer，什么都能吃 😄 See you on Wednesday！
[A]: How refreshing to meet someone who appreciates both fintech and fitness! Our gym facilities are actually quite lovely if you'd like to arrive a bit early. Until Wednesday then - I'll be sure to have everything prepared for our discussion. Safe travels!
[B]: Great idea！Maybe I'll come at 2pm for a quick workout 💪 这样meeting前还能get some energy boost。Thanks for the hospitality，see you soon！
[A]: What a splendid plan! Our fitness center has just installed new Peloton bikes that our guests are raving about. I'll notify the staff to expect you at 2pm. We keep fresh towels and chilled infused waters at the ready. See you Wednesday, Ms. Lin!
[B]: Peloton bikes？Now you're speaking my language！🚴‍♀️ 这meeting真是getting better and better了～ Appreciate the thoughtful arrangement，周三见！
[A]: Delighted to hear it! Our head trainer will be on hand if you'd like any pointers - though I suspect you're quite the expert already. We'll make sure your workout and our meeting are equally energizing. Until Wednesday!
[B]: Haha 被你看出来了～ 确实每周都会cycle至少三次！Alright，不耽误你时间了，周三见！Keep you posted if any schedule changes 👍
[A]: How wonderful to meet a fellow cycling enthusiast! Our paths seem to cross in the most delightful ways. I'll keep an eye out for any updates, but for now - happy pedaling until we meet on Wednesday!
[B]: Likewise！Looking forward to both the workout and our fintech chat 🚀 Have a great day ahead！
