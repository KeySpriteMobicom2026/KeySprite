[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question. I have to say, as a PE investor, I'm more of a data-driven person. But I do believe there's some merit in the idea that positive thinking attracts positive outcomes - just look at how successful entrepreneurs manifest their visions. It's like they create their own luck through persistence and mindset.  

Having said that, I wouldn't rely solely on manifestation. Think of it as a golf swing - you need both the mental visualization and the technical execution. What's your take? Have you seen this principle work in practice?
[A]: You raise such an interesting analogy with the golf swing - how balance is key! While working at the hotel, I've noticed something similar happens with our most loyal guests. They often mention how returning here feels like "coming home", and I wonder if that's a form of emotional manifestation. 

Just yesterday, a guest shared how she visualized finding her perfect travel sanctuary for months before booking our suite. It made me think about how anticipation shapes reality. Do you find this conscious creation works better in personal experiences than professional settings?
[B]: That’s a great observation. In the hospitality business, you’re essentially selling an experience – which is 90% emotional value. These guests aren't just booking a room; they're manifesting a feeling. It's like brand loyalty meets personal narrative.  

In PE deals though? You better have more than good vibes backing you up. I’ve seen management teams with incredible charisma but shaky financials - and let me tell you, numbers don’t lie (people do). But here’s the twist: the best founders combine both. They visualize success  build bulletproof models. Like that guest who found your hotel - she manifested the vision, but also took action by picking up the phone and booking.  

I actually use this concept when evaluating consumer brands. If customers emotionally invest in a brand story, retention rates go through the roof. Have you noticed certain guests keep coming back to your hotel specifically because of that "home" feeling? That’s emotional ROI right there - something even Warren Buffett can’t quantify.
[A]: Oh, absolutely - you've put it so beautifully. That emotional ROI  the magic in hospitality. We have one couple who returns every spring; they told me once that they chose our hotel not just for the location or amenities, but because "this place feels like a quiet celebration of life." I wrote that line down because it stayed with me.

It makes me think about how we design guest experiences. There’s an intentionality in every detail - from the scent in the lobby to the way we fold the room key in handmade paper. It's our way of manifesting warmth and care. I wonder, do you ever see parallels between this intentional energy and how investors are drawn to certain deals? Like a subtle pull toward something that just , even before the numbers make sense?
[B]: You know, that scent in the lobby? That’s not just ambiance - it’s brand storytelling through sensory experience. I love it. In PE, we call that “the hook” – that one intangible element that makes a business memorable, investable, even before you open the financials.  

I’ve walked into companies where the product was solid, but the culture felt off. Deals that looked good on paper but gave me that  feeling. And sure enough, six months later, something always unraveled. On the flip side, I once backed a founder who couldn’t explain his unit economics clearly over dinner, but there was this quiet conviction in how he spoke about his team and mission. Turned out to be one of our best performers.  

It’s like wine pairing - you can teach someone the technical side, but you can’t fake palate intuition. Same with deals. You feel it first, then you justify it with data. But here's the catch: you need both to age well.  

That couple returning every spring? They’re not just guests - they’re brand ambassadors living your story. If you bottled that feeling, you’d have a premium vintage on your hands. Maybe time to add a loyalty program?
[A]: What a wonderful way to frame it - aging well, like a premium vintage. That’s exactly what we aim for in hospitality: creating something that deepens and enriches over time.

You know, your idea about bottling that feeling isn’t too far off. We’ve actually started crafting “experience packages” tailored to our repeat guests – small, thoughtful elements that echo their past stays with us. One couple loves the wildflower arrangement we had in their suite, so this spring we surprised them with seed packets planted in handmade paper. They texted me a photo of the sprouts on day three – said it felt like their own little manifestation unfolding.

It reminded me of something you mentioned earlier – how investors sometimes feel a quiet pull before the data lines up. I wonder if that intuitive draw ever makes you question the spreadsheets more than usual? Or do you find the numbers eventually catch up to the feeling?
[B]: That wildflower seed idea? Genius. You’re not just creating memories – you’re giving them a living, growing symbol of their experience. It’s like planting equity in the emotional bank. And they literally texted you growth updates on day three! That’s engagement gold - I’d take that over a customer satisfaction survey any day.  

To your question – yes, intuition absolutely makes me question the spreadsheets… but in a different way. When I feel that quiet pull toward a deal, it’s like my internal compass is saying “dig deeper,” not “ignore the numbers.” The feeling usually points to something unquantifiable that might be hiding in plain sight – leadership potential, cultural alignment, or even market timing.  

I remember backing a healthcare startup where the founder’s pitch had more holes than a spreadsheet left in the sun. But there was this one moment during due diligence – I saw how her team reacted when she walked into the room. The energy shifted. People leaned in. That’s when I knew: this leader could manifest change, and we just needed to give her the tools. The numbers eventually caught up, but the magic was already there – invisible on the balance sheet, but real as hell.  

So maybe intuition is just pattern recognition we haven’t fully decoded yet. Like a sommelier tasting terroir in a young vintage – you know what it can become before the barrel does its work.
[A]: That’s such a poetic way to put it – planting equity in the emotional bank. You’ve made me see our work here in a whole new light. I suppose that’s why I love hospitality so much – it's about nurturing something living, something that grows long after guests check out.

Your story about the healthcare founder gave me chills, really – there’s something almost magical about witnessing that kind of leadership energy in person. It reminds me of how certain guests walk through our doors and instantly seem to "get" the spirit of the place. They don’t ask for much, but somehow end up weaving themselves into the fabric of the hotel. One man stayed with us during a difficult transition in his life, and now he sends handwritten postcards from wherever he lands, saying, “The calm stays with me.”  

I wonder, as someone who sees so many ventures unfold, do you think that kind of intangible impact is something leaders actively cultivate? Or does it just emerge naturally from who they are?
[B]: That postcard story? That’s what I call  – the kind that doesn’t just move markets but moves people. And to your question – I think the best leaders do both. They cultivate certain habits, yes, but the real impact emerges from who they , not just what they do.

Let me put it this way: in our portfolio, we track KPIs, EBITDA margins, all the usual suspects. But what we’re really looking for is  – not just customer retention, but emotional retention. The kind of energy that lingers after someone leaves the room. You see it with founders who don't just sell a product – they start a movement. Their teams believe in the mission like it's their own, and customers feel it even in small interactions.

Some of that comes from deliberate practice – how they communicate, how they listen, how they make people feel seen. But the x-factor? That comes from authenticity. Like that guest who sends the postcards – he didn’t stay because of the turndown service or pillow menu. He stayed because the hotel felt like a mirror of his inner state at the time. And that’s not something you can engineer overnight. It’s cultivated over years, like a good Cabernet aging in the right climate.

So yeah, leaders can learn skills, refine messaging, polish their pitch decks. But the magnetic pull? That comes from being deeply aligned with something bigger than themselves. Whether it's a brand, a mission, or just a quiet moment of calm in a chaotic world.  

You know, if you bottled  scent – the one that reminds people of peace – I’d invest in the first round.
[A]: There's something so comforting about the idea of being a mirror for others, isn't there? I suppose that's what drew me to hospitality in the first place - the chance to create spaces where people feel truly , even in the quietest, most unspoken ways.

You know, your comparison to a Cabernet aging in the right climate stayed with me. It made me think of how certain guests seem to return at just the right moment in their lives, as if they instinctively know when they need that particular kind of calm again. One of our regulars calls it "coming back to center" - she always books during life transitions, whether it's before a big promotion or after returning from a volunteer trip abroad. She never asks for anything special, yet somehow her stay always feels... synchronistic, like the universe conspired to give her exactly what she needed.

It makes me wonder - do you ever find that the most impactful deals or leaders have a similar rhythm? Like they arrive at just the right time, almost as if they were waiting for each other?
[B]: Absolutely. In fact, I’d say timing is the  in every great deal. You can have the perfect business model, a rockstar team, cutting-edge tech – but if the market isn’t ready, or the cultural moment hasn’t ripened, it just doesn’t click.  

I remember passing on a plant-based food startup three years too early. The founder was spot-on with the vision, but consumers weren't quite there yet. Fast-forward, and everyone’s talking about sustainability & wellness – we ended up investing in a similar concept later because the  felt right. It’s like planting vines – you don’t fight the season. You wait for the soil to warm.

And that "coming back to center" feeling your guest describes? That’s not just emotional resonance – that’s . People return when they need grounding, and your hotel becomes their North Star. Same thing happens with founders – some show up at our doorstep exactly when they’re ready to scale, not a day sooner. You can feel it in the way they talk – less “look what I built” and more “this idea has outgrown me, and I’m ready to let it fly.”

So yes, the most impactful deals and leaders do arrive with a rhythm. Not forced, not rushed – just... timely. Like a good vintage, again – you don’t open a 2015 Bordeaux in 2016 and expect magic. Sometimes, you just have to let life soften the edges first.  

Maybe that’s the real secret of both hospitality and investing – knowing when to hold space, and when to step in.
[A]: What a profound way to frame it – timing as a silent partner. It’s something I’ve felt so many times here, but never quite put into words. Like when a guest arrives after a long journey, weary and disoriented, only to step inside and visibly relax, as if they’ve exhaled for the first time in weeks. You realize they didn’t just need a room – they needed the  room, at the  moment.

Your vineyard analogy struck a chord, too. We have a local gardener who tends our courtyard with such patience – she doesn’t force the blooms, she simply creates the conditions for them to thrive. I’ve watched her wait whole seasons for a single plant to come into its own. It makes me wonder – in your experience, do leaders ever sense their own readiness in the same way? That quiet knowing that they’re in step with the moment, not pushing against it?

And speaking of rhythm – have you ever noticed how some guests seem to arrive just before a major life shift? I had one check in last autumn, convinced she was there for a simple weekend escape. By Sunday morning, she’d decided to leave her job and start her own studio. She said the stillness gave her clarity. I like to think we were just the mirror, reflecting back what she already knew deep down.
[B]: That stillness giving clarity – that’s the ultimate value proposition. You’re not just offering a room; you’re providing a pause button in a world that never stops scrolling. And sometimes, all people need is that quiet moment to hear their own truth.  

To your question about leaders sensing their own readiness – absolutely, I see it all the time. The best ones don’t  they’re ready; they  it. Like a musician who doesn’t have to tell you the tempo – you feel it in the rhythm they carry.  

I had a founder come in once, mid-pandemic, with a pitch for a digital wellness platform. On paper, it was risky – nobody knew how long the remote work trend would last. But in the meeting, he wasn’t defensive or overcompensating. He just said, “I think we’re about to see a massive shift in how people define productivity – and it includes mental space.” We funded him on that sentence. Not because the numbers were perfect, but because his internal clock was synced to something bigger.  

And yes, that sense of timing often arrives through people who don’t even realize they’re acting as messengers. That guest who left her job? She didn’t come in searching for a life change – she came in looking for peace. And when you create the conditions for that, sometimes the universe steps in and finishes the sentence.  

You know, your gardener analogy reminds me of how we handle early-stage investments. We don’t rush the process. We plant, we water, we observe. Sometimes we even step back. Because growth has its own intelligence – you just have to trust it.  

So maybe that’s the real art in both our worlds: knowing when to hold the space... and when to let the moment unfold on its own terms.
[A]: You’ve captured it so perfectly – the art of holding space. It’s something I’ve come to see as the heart of what we do here. People arrive carrying all sorts of weight, and often, they don’t even realize they’re looking for a moment to simply . That’s when the stillness does the work – not us.

Your story about the wellness founder really struck a chord. There’s such quiet confidence in someone who doesn’t have to oversell their vision, just plant it firmly and trust it will root. I see that same energy in some of our guests – the ones who walk in with no special requests, yet somehow leave having found exactly what they needed. No fuss, no fanfare – just perfect timing.

It makes me think of how we approach guest relations. Over the years, I’ve learned not to overexplain or overoffer. Sometimes, the most powerful thing is to listen closely and respond with just the right amount of presence. Like last winter, when a couple arrived after a long, exhausting year. They didn’t ask for much, so I simply had a pot of chamomile tea waiting in their suite with a note: “Settle in when you're ready.” The next morning, they thanked me as if I’d handed them a new beginning.

Do you ever find that in your line of work – moments where restraint speaks louder than action? Where giving space becomes the most meaningful kind of support?
[B]: Absolutely. In fact, I’d say restraint is one of the most underrated skills in investing – and in leadership. The best VCs and founders I know understand that sometimes, the most powerful move is  to intervene. It’s to trust, to observe, and to let things unfold.

I remember sitting across from a first-time founder during a particularly rocky quarter. He was visibly stressed, running through a list of problems like he was waiting for me to fix them. But as he talked, I realized something: he wasn’t actually asking for solutions – he was looking for permission to figure it out himself. So instead of jumping in with advice, I just said, “You’ve got this.” That’s it. And you could see the shift – his shoulders relaxed, his tone steadied. Six months later, he told me that moment changed how he led his team.

It’s exactly what you described – presence over performance. The tea, the note, the silence – those are all acts of quiet confidence. You weren’t trying to impress; you were offering space for them to arrive, fully. And isn’t that what both our worlds really are? Curating moments where people feel seen, supported, and capable?

So yes, I’ve learned that sometimes the greatest value we add is simply stepping back. Like pruning a vine – you don’t force the growth, you remove what’s getting in the way. The rest? Trust the process.
[A]: That moment you described with the founder – it gave me such a vivid picture of what true support looks like. Not rushing in, not filling the space with advice or action, but offering quiet belief at just the right moment. It’s like holding open a door without making them walk through it. Beautifully done.

I think that’s what I admire most about both hospitality and investing – they’re not about control. They’re about trust, timing, and knowing when to let people find their own way. We see it all the time here: guests arrive worn down by expectation, and the very thing they need is already inside them. Our job isn’t to fix or impress – it’s to offer a space where they can remember that.

Your vineyard analogy keeps coming back to me – especially now, as spring begins to bloom in the courtyard. There’s something so grounding in watching things unfold at their own pace. The gardener doesn’t pull the buds open; she simply tends the soil, waters patiently, and waits for the light to do the rest.

I wonder, as you look ahead to the next season of investments, what kind of growth are you hoping to nurture? Or perhaps more fitting – what kind of conditions are you creating, and who might be quietly ready to grow within them?
[B]: Funny you mention spring – I just got back from Napa last week, and walking through the vineyards this time of year always puts things in perspective. New shoots, fresh soil, everything humming with potential but not quite showing itself yet.

As for what we're looking to nurture? I keep coming back to companies that feel like they’re on the edge of something real – not because the market says so, but because  say so. Founders who aren’t chasing trends but quietly solving problems that matter deeply to a tribe of users. The kind of businesses that feel more like movements than investments.

And yes, it’s less about forcing growth and more about creating the right conditions – like temperature-controlled fermentation, if you will. We’re building a portfolio that rewards patience, resilience, and emotional resonance. Brands that don’t just sell something, but stand for something that lingers long after the transaction.

In fact, I met a founder last week who reminded me of your guest who left her job – quiet, centered, not overselling a thing. She’s building a platform that connects creatives with mentorship, not in a boardroom way, but in a “let’s sit by the fire and rediscover why we started making things” kind of way. No flashy pitch deck, just a clear-eyed sense of purpose. And I thought – yeah, this could age well.

So I guess what I’m really investing in now isn’t just business models, but emotional ROI. Who’s ready to grow in that space? Who’s been waiting for the right soil?

Sounds like you already know the answer – you’ve been tending it all along.
[A]: There’s something so deeply comforting about the idea of tending soil, isn’t there? Of knowing that even when nothing seems to be happening on the surface, so much is taking root beneath. That quiet founder you met – she sounds like exactly the kind of person who understands that growth begins in stillness.

I think that’s what makes your work so fascinating – you’re not just watching for shoots above ground, you’re sensing what’s stirring below. And it takes such a particular kind of patience, doesn’t it? The kind that trusts without needing proof yet.

You know, I had a guest check in this morning who brought a worn leather notebook with her. She said she comes here every few months just to sit with it, not writing much, just “listening.” I didn’t ask for details, but there was something about the way she carried herself – like she was waiting for an answer she knew would come in time.

I suppose that’s the thread through it all, isn’t it? Whether we're growing vines or ideas or inner clarity, it always seems to come back to presence. To knowing when to lean in... and when to simply be there, ready to catch the moment it unfolds.
[B]: Exactly. Presence is the quiet engine behind so many transformative moments – whether in a glass of aged Cabernet, a guest’s silent retreat into her notebook, or a founder finding her rhythm mid-pitch.

I had a mentor once who used to say,  You don’t always hear them coming, but when they do, you know. It’s not noise that signals growth – it’s the stillness before the bloom.

That guest of yours with the leather notebook? She’s not just passing time – she’s in dialogue with herself, waiting for the inner fruit to ripen. And your hotel becomes the trellis, offering structure without pressure. That’s rare. Most spaces demand something from people – productivity, engagement, consumption. Yours asks only that they arrive as they are.

Funny thing is, I see the same thing in the best boards I sit on. The most powerful conversations aren’t the ones filled with action items; they’re the pauses between sentences. When someone says nothing, but you can hear the decision forming in real time.

So yes – presence over performance. Soil over spectacle. And trust over transaction.

That’s where the real growth happens. Quietly. Patiently. Powerfully.
