[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I think it really depends on the mood. Pop music has those catchy tunes that you can sing along to, like most people would enjoy. But indie music... there's something special about its unique style and lyrical depth. Personally, I appreciate both genres for different reasons. What about you? Do you have a preference between pop and indie?
[A]: You know, I’ve always believed music is like cinema—it’s all about emotional resonance. Pop music? It’s the blockbuster summer hit—everyone dances to it, and there’s magic in how it unites millions. But indie… ah, indie’s like a hidden gem of a film that only a few discover. It carries raw authenticity, like early Wong Kar-wai scenes scored to obscure tunes no one’s heard of.  

Honestly, I can’t pick a side. When I’m driving through L.A. at sunset, nothing beats blasting some  and feeling like I’m in my own movie. Yet, when I’m editing a script late at night or flipping through storyboards, I need that low-fi, poetic indie vibe to stay grounded.  

Do you ever feel like certain songs could be the perfect soundtrack to your life? I’ve been scouting young artists lately for an upcoming project, and man, the new indie scene is full of cinematic potential.
[B]: That’s beautifully put. I couldn’t agree more—music and cinema both create a space where emotions can just… . Pop music, like you said, is that shared experience—the sonic equivalent of a standing ovation. And indie? It’s like those quiet, lingering shots that stay with you long after the credits roll.  

Funny you mentioned Billie Eilish—I actually had her on during a late-night drive last week. There’s something oddly calming about her vibe when the city lights blur past. But when I’m reviewing medical malpractice cases or preparing for a deposition, I switch to lo-fi indie beats. It helps me focus without getting emotionally drained.  

As for your question—absolutely, I do think certain songs mirror life moments. One time, while going through an especially tough case file,  came on shuffle. The line “I think I’ll go to sleep…” just hit differently that night.  

You’re working on a project now? That sounds exciting! Are you looking at original compositions or licensing existing indie tracks?
[A]: Oh, that line from —man, that’s pure screenplay gold right there. You ever think about writing? Because that kind of emotional timing? That’s storytelling.

As for the project, it’s a passion piece I’ve been developing with a first-time director out of Taipei. Very Wong Kar-wai meets early Greta Gerwig, if you can picture that. We’re leaning into original compositions, but with that lo-fi, intimate indie texture you're talking about. Think , ambient textures under whispered dialogue—it's all about mood.

We actually brought in this underground Taiwanese artist, totally raw, goes by the name . His demo had me at the second bar—he’s got that quiet storm thing going on, like he’s scoring people’s private thoughts. I’m telling you, once this film drops, everyone’s gonna want his sound.

And hey, speaking of taste—I get the feeling you’ve got an ear for more than just courtroom playlists. Ever thought about diving into music supervision or film consulting?
[B]: Wow, that project sounds like exactly the kind of cinematic poetry that stays with you. I can already picture it—Moss Ocean? Interesting name. Very atmospheric. I love how indie artists often carry that unfiltered emotion without trying too hard to explain it. It’s like… they just .

To be honest, I’ve never formally considered music supervision, but now that you mention it, there’s something deeply satisfying about matching tone and texture—whether it’s in a film or even in a legal strategy. Funny how rhythm and pacing matter just as much in a courtroom narrative as they do on screen.  

I actually did some freelance writing back in law school—mostly op-eds and policy analysis—but I’ve always been drawn to storytelling in subtler forms. Maybe that’s why I appreciate good soundtracks so much. They’re like the unsung subtext of a scene. Or a life moment.

Let me ask you something—if you could score one pivotal case from your career like a film scene, what genre would it be? And who would be on the playlist?
[A]: Now  a fascinating question—one I wish more people asked. If I had to score a pivotal moment from my career… hell, let’s just say the entire trajectory of my first big break felt like a cross between a Tarantino standoff and a Sofia Coppola montage. Tense, yet dreamy. High stakes, but deeply personal.

I’d go full —think  meets . That raw, gravelly truth with just enough poetry to make it bearable. One scene in particular? When we locked the final deal for , after months of chasing investors who kept saying no—no——until some eccentric French financier finally said  We were all in this tiny office above a jazz club in West Hollywood, rain tapping on the windows like a snare drum roll.  

I swear, if that moment had a soundtrack, it would’ve been  on low-fi vinyl, something off —haunting, sparse, almost too real. Like the whole room was holding its breath before the credits rolled.

You know what’s funny? I’ve never told anyone this, but I actually wrote a short monologue about that night. Maybe I’ll dig it up and send it your way. Just don’t laugh too hard—it was written in pure adrenaline and espresso.
[B]: That monologue is already playing in my head like a voiceover— You’ve got the ear of a filmmaker and the soul of a poet. I can totally see you writing your own  scripts—maybe even directing someday.

Alt-folk noir, huh? I love it. It’s got that courtroom kind of honesty—raw, unpolished, but deeply human. And Gillian Welch? Iconic choice. There’s something about her voice that cuts through the noise without ever raising its volume. Kind of like how truth works, if you think about it.

I’d absolutely read that monologue. Hell, I might even prescribe it as required reading for anyone stepping into their first big negotiation. Call it   

You ever consider collaborating with musicians to score your future projects based on real-life legal drama moments? Because honestly, I’d be down to consult—if only to suggest the perfect  playlist.
[A]: Now  the kind of collaboration I live for—when art and life start finishing each other’s sentences. Imagine a film where every legal showdown feels like a slow-burn ballad, every courtroom reveal hits like a key change you didn’t see coming. You bring the real-world tension, I bring the cinematic pulse, and together—we make it .

I can already hear it: the quiet before the verdict, scored with just a faint hum of a broken AC unit and a heartbeat on guitar strings. Then——the ruling drops, and the strings swell like someone finally exhaling after holding their breath for two hours. That’s the power of a great score. It doesn’t tell you how to feel—it just  what you’re feeling already.

You’d be perfect for this. Hell, I’m half-tempted to send you a rough cut of our Taipei project just to see what sonic instincts you’d pair with its visuals. No pressure or anything—but if you're in, I’ll get you a screener by tomorrow night. Just promise me one thing: no spoilers, no casual spoilers, and definitely no humming the theme while I'm trying to pitch this to distributors.

So… deal?
[B]: Deal—but only if I get to suggest a  motif for the quiet, almost-too-real moments. And honestly? I’d welcome the challenge of syncing real-life legal tension with cinematic rhythm. It’s like translating silence into sound.

I’ll clear my evening tomorrow. Just send over the screener and a cup of something strong—I’m ready to be transported. And don’t worry, my lips are sealed tighter than a closed deposition.  

Let’s make this happen.
[A]: Now  the kind of greenlight I love hearing. You’ve got yourself a plan, counselor—screeners going out tonight, and we’ll call it “Project Silent Sync” until further notice. Nick Cave for the soul, Gillian Welch for the truth, and you in the director’s chair of sound and story.

This is gonna be good. Hell, maybe even . Or at least Cannes-adjacent.  

See you on the other side of the screen. And yeah—let’s make this happen.
[B]: Now  the kind of pitch that gets my legal pad shaking. Let’s just hope I don’t fall asleep with the score on repeat before our next call.

Oscar-worthy? Cannes-adjacent? You’re speaking my language—though I’ll settle for a standing ovation in a darkened living room with takeout and good headphones.

See you on the other side, producer. Just don’t forget to add a林志远 subtitle somewhere in the credits—I’m thinking something like: “For those who still believe in truth, timing, and the occasional well-placed pause.”  

Roll tape. 🎥
[A]: 林志远 — now  a name with cinematic weight. I’m carving that subtitle into the opening scene, not the credits. Hell, maybe even over the first frame of rain hitting a neon-lit street.  

And don’t worry, no one falls asleep on my watch—not with Moss Ocean humming like a storm you don’t want to outrun and Nick Cave whispering courtroom confessions in the background.  

Takeout, headphones, legal pad—whatever gets you ready, I’ll be on the other end, probably pacing my living room like a first-time director before opening night.  

Roll tape indeed. 🎥🍿  
This is how stories begin.
[B]:  cinematic weight, huh? I like that.林志远—subtitle over the first frame of rain, neon, and unresolved tension. Sounds like the start of something we’ll both be quoting in deposition rooms and film festivals ten years from now.

And hey, pacing is good luck. So is espresso. And if Moss Ocean’s humming gets too intense, just remember—you brought this storm on yourself.

Let’s make sure this story doesn’t just begin… let’s make sure it .  

Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[A]: Unresolved tension, huh? Now you're speaking my language.林志远—yeah, that subtitle’s gonna hit like a perfect cold open. No exposition, no setup, just .  

And stick it must. Because if there's one thing this town needs more of, it's stories that don't just end—they echo.  

Pacing, espresso, and self-inflicted storms? All part of the process. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.  

Stick it to the silence. Lean into the rhythm. And let the truth ride the soundtrack like it's chasing its own shadow through a rain-slick street.

Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[B]: Truth in the atmosphere… no setup, just . Now  how you open a film—or a case.  

I’m telling you, when they write the history of this project,林志远 won’t just be a name on a subtitle. It’ll be the moment the audience leans in, whispers “who is that?” and suddenly cares about every pause, every line, every unsaid thing in between.

Stick it to the silence? Hell yes. Lean in, turn up the volume, and let the echoes do the rest.

Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[A]: Exactly. No setup, just —that’s the kind of silence that speaks louder than dialogue.林志远 is not just a subtitle, he’s the pulse under the surface. The audience won’t know why they lean in… but they will.

And I love it. I  for that kind of quiet storm. You ever think about how some moments in film feel like they were stolen from real life? That’s what we’re making here. Stolen moments, scored like secrets.

Turn up the volume. Let the echoes hit the back wall. And whatever you do—don’t look away.

Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[B]: Stolen moments, scored like secrets—damn, that’s good. That’s  good. You’re not just making a film; you’re curating truth in slow motion.

And林志远? Let him be the quiet pulse they feel before they even know his name. Let him be the unsung rhythm under the dialogue, the one everyone remembers  the screen cuts to black.

I’m in. All in. Turn it up. Let the echoes shake the speakers. Don’t look away—and don’t let the audience blink either.

Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[A]: You got it. All in. No blinking, no backing down—just raw, slow-motion truth wrapped in sound and silence.林志远 isn’t just a name; he’s the breath before the line, the pause that cracks open the scene.

Let the echoes shake the speakers. Let the unsung rhythm carry the weight of everything left off the page. That’s where the magic lives—in the space between notes, between words, between what’s said and what’s .

This is it. This is how truth becomes legend.  
Roll tape. 🎥🍿  

[B]: The breath before the line… yeah, that’s where it all starts—the weight of what’s unspoken, the charge in the air before a single word is even said.林志远 isn’t just in the scene—he’s 

Let the silence carry the truth. Let the sound carry the soul. And let the audience feel everything they can’t quite explain.

This is it.  
Roll tape. 🎥🍿
