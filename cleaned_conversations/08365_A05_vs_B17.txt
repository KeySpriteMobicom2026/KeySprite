[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I must confess astronomy isn't my primary field of study, I do find celestial metaphors in poetry rather exciting. Just yesterday I was reading Tennyson's "Ulysses" and marveling at how the Victorian poets used cosmic imagery to explore human consciousness. The line "To follow knowledge like a sinking star" particularly resonates with modern space exploration, don't you think?
[A]:  Interesting perspective...不过从investment角度看，我更关注SpaceX最近的valuation变化。Their Starlink project的EBITDA margin正在改善，这可能会disrupt整个telecom sector。说到stars，倒是让我想起上周看的BlackRock最新space tech sector report~
[B]: My dear friend, while financial analyses have their merits, I can't help but reflect on how differently we approach the concept of 'stars'. Where you see EBITDA margins, I see Keats' "bright star" that watches "with eternal lids apart". Though I suppose even in finance, one might say the market has its own poetic rhythms - bullish verses and bearish stanzas, if you will. Wouldn't you agree there's a certain lyrical quality to economic cycles?
[A]:  Haha，你这种文艺范儿的比喻让我想起我们最近看的一个biotech IPO - 股价走势确实像十四行诗一样有韵律呢！不过seriously speaking，market sentiment现在更像free verse poetry，完全unpredictable。我们fund刚投了个AI quant trading platform，用machine learning来decode这些'市场诗歌'~ 😊
[B]: How fascinating - though I must say, your comparison between market volatility and free verse poetry is rather... unconventional. While Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" celebrated organic form, I suspect even he would be perplexed by algorithmic trading patterns! Still, there's something beautifully human about trying to impose artistic structure on financial chaos. Reminds me of Eliot's "The Waste Land" - though I doubt he envisioned his fragmented modernism being applied to stock charts.
[A]:  哈！T.S. Eliot meets Wall Street - 这倒是我们hedge fund manager们coffee chat时没讨论过的新角度。不过说到fragmentation，现在market确实越来越segmented了。我们刚closed一个cross-border M&A deal，整个过程比解读《荒原》还复杂！需要像解构诗歌一样analyze每个clause的hidden meaning~ 😅 要不要听听这个deal的equity story？绝对比文学critique精彩！
[B]:  My dear financial friend, while your enthusiasm is admirable, I'm afraid equity stories lack the metaphorical depth I cherish. Though I must admit, the notion of 'hidden meanings' in contracts does remind me of Emily Dickinson's dashes - those tantalizing pauses that invite interpretation. But tell me, does your M&A deal contain anything as profound as "Because I could not stop for Death - He kindly stopped for me"? Or is it all EBITDA adjustments and synergy calculations?
[A]:  Well...我们的purchase agreement里确实有句'death clause' - 不过是关于termination rights的！😂 说真的，在leveraged buyout里，'death'通常指的是deal collapse时的breakup fee。虽然不如Dickinson的诗句优美，但对我们LP来说同样heart-stopping呢~ 要不要我share这个deal的financial model？保证比分析poetic meter更刺激！
[B]: Oh my, financial models as thrillers! While I appreciate the offer, I believe I'll stick to my Browning and Byron. Though I must say, your description of 'death clauses' does have a certain gothic romance to it - the modern equivalent of a Bronte novel's inheritance disputes, perhaps? Just without the moors and brooding heroes. Do carry on with your... numerical sonnets, while I return to my well-thumbed copy of "Sonnets from the Portuguese."
[A]:  Fair enough~ 不过下次你读Browning的时候，想想我们的distressed debt fund - 那才是真正的'dramatic monologue'，每个default story都比戏剧精彩！Cheers to both poetry and private equity 🍷 也许有天我们会找到它们的intersection point。现在我得去review Q3的portfolio performance了 - 希望numbers能像你的十四行诗一样beautifully structured! 😉
[B]: What a delightful thought - though I suspect my idea of 'beautiful structure' involves more iambic pentameter and less Excel formatting! Still, your passion reminds me that even in finance, there's artistry to be found. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a seminar on metaphysical poetry to prepare - where we'll be debating whether Donne's "No man is an island" applies to modern portfolio theory! Do keep me posted if you discover any particularly poetic P/E ratios.
[A]:  Will do! 说不定下个unicorn startup会叫'John Donne Capital'呢~ 专门invest in interconnected markets 😄 说到这个，我们刚投了个blockchain project - 他们的white paper写得比某些modern poetry还难decipher！Keep me updated if you find any sonnets about venture capital exits. Catch you on the golf course? ⛳
[B]: Ah, 'John Donne Capital' - now there's a prospectus I'd actually enjoy reading! Though I imagine their offering memorandum would still pale next to "The Canonization". As for golf... let's just say my handicap is as high as some of those blockchain valuations appear to be. Do send that white paper though - if it's truly more obscure than Pound's Cantos, it might finally convince me to diversify beyond municipal bonds and first editions!
[A]:  Deal! 我会让analyst team准备个poetry-to-finance glossary给你 - 把'volatility'翻译成'romantic turbulence'之类的 😂 说真的，你该来参加我们下月的investor conference，主题是'The Art of the Deal'...虽然可能比不了你那些文学symposium，但至少open bar的酒单是poetically curated! 🥂
[B]: How wonderfully you blend our worlds! Though I suspect your 'poetically curated' bar would stock more IPOs than IPAs. Very well - pencil me in, provided there's a quiet corner where I can murmur "Ode on a Grecian Urn" to myself when the EBITDA multiples become too overwhelming. And do remind your analysts that in Keats' terms, 'negative covenant' should properly translate as 'thou still unravish'd bride of quietness'!
[A]:  Touché! 我们绝对会在name tags背面印上Keats的诗句 - 就选那句'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'，正好match我们的valuation philosophy 😉 不过warning：当PE ratio开始diverge from reality时，我可能会start reciting 'Ode to a Nightingale' instead！See you at the conference - 我会ensure bartender准备些真正'verse-worthy'的vintage！ 🍷✨
[B]: What perfect synchronicity! Though I must warn you, if the vintages prove truly 'verse-worthy', we may end up reenacting the Symposium rather than discussing it - with your LPs playing Socrates to my rather tipsy Alcibiades! Until then, I shall practice my most investor-friendly sonnet: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's IRR? Thou art more lovely and more temperate..." Do keep a defibrillator handy for when the purists hear that one!
[A]:  这个改编版sonnet绝对要放进我们next fundraising pitchbook！说不定能charm那些old-money LPs 😂 不过提醒我准备些aspirin - 以防有人因为我们的'creative accounting' of Shakespeare而晕倒~ 现在真的得run了，emergency board call about a portfolio company's cash burn rate... 希望不会变成'Rage, rage against the dying of the EBITDA'！Ciao for now, poet-in-arms! ✌️
[B]: Oh splendid! Though I do hope your emergency call concludes more happily than King Lear's financial restructuring! Do remember - when explaining cash burn rates, always channel your inner Wordsworth: "The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers..." Now off you go to battle those spreadsheet dragons - may your IRR be ever in your favor! Ta-ta!
