[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on what stage of life you're at, right? For me, career-wise, definitely city life. The ecosystem for tech professionals is just way more vibrant. But honestly, sometimes I wish I could have a small place in the countryside for weekends. Imagine working remotely from a cozy cabin surrounded by mountains... Yeah, that balance might be ideal. What about you? Do you prefer one over the other or also thinking about some kind of hybrid lifestyle?
[A]: I suppose I’ve always leaned toward the countryside, though not for the reasons you might expect. There’s something about being surrounded by nature that lets you slow down and notice the details—the way light filters through trees, or the texture of aged fabric under careful fingers. Cities feel a bit too loud for that kind of quiet appreciation.

Still, I won’t deny the convenience of being near a good antique market or specialty shop when restoring textiles. So maybe I’m already living that hybrid life without realizing it—splitting my time between a little studio on the outskirts and nearby towns when needed.  

Do you think having both options would ever be practical long-term? Or is it more of a dream than a plan?
[B]: I totally get what you're saying. There's a certain mindfulness that comes with countryside living—like time actually allows you to . And yeah, cities can drown that in noise and rush. But here’s the thing: having both feels less like a dream and more like a design problem, right? Like, how do you structure your workflow, your commitments, so it actually ?  

For example, if you’re restoring textiles, maybe you set up your main studio in the countryside, handle the detailed stuff there, and then go into the city for markets, clients, or exhibitions. Add a bit of remote coordination in between, and boom—you’ve got yourself a semi-nomadic setup. I’d even say tech tools make this easier than ever. Calendar blocks, delivery services, cloud storage... all that infrastructure lets you have the best of both worlds without getting stuck in one.  

But honestly, the bigger question is—are you willing to trade some convenience for that balance? Because that’s what it usually comes down to. What do you value more: easy access to everything, or the space to really focus on your craft?
[A]: That’s beautifully put— I suppose I’ve been circling that question for years without quite naming it. You’re right about the tools we have now making this kind of rhythm possible. I’ve started digitizing fabric swatches and client communications, which sounds simple, but it’s already giving me more flexibility.

I love your idea of a semi-nomadic setup—it feels grounded enough to be real, but fluid enough to adapt. The studio in the countryside could be my sanctuary, where the real magic happens, and city trips could be intentional, almost ceremonial—a chance to gather new inspiration, meet fellow artisans, find rare materials.

As for the trade-off… I think I’m ready to make peace with a little inconvenience if it means more space to focus, fewer distractions. After all, restoration isn’t about speed; it’s about patience, precision, presence. And those things seem harder to come by in the city’s constant rush.

So maybe the real question isn’t just about location, but what kind of life you want to stitch together—one thread at a time.
[B]: Exactly! It’s like you’re curating a lifestyle rather than just choosing a place. And I love how you put that—. That’s such a perfect metaphor for intentional living.

I think the key is treating your time and energy like precious materials—carefully selecting, thoughtfully weaving them together. Too often we treat life like fast fashion, right? Quick, disposable, mass-produced. But what you're doing—slow, deliberate, handmade—it demands (and deserves) a different rhythm.

Have you thought about maybe building a small online community around your work? Not just for clients, but for fellow textile lovers? Could even become a way to fund part of your semi-nomadic dream—like offering digital workshops or limited edition fabric kits. Just a thought 💡

And hey, if you ever need help structuring any of that from a product or workflow angle, I’d be happy to brainstorm. Always down to support a fellow creator!
[A]: That’s incredibly kind of you to offer—I appreciate that more than I can say. You know, I’ve been toying with the idea of an online space, but I think what held me back was the noise. So much of the digital world feels overwhelming, or worse, performative. But your analogy about treating time and energy like precious materials really reframes it for me. If I approach it like a restoration project—curated, intentional, slow—it starts to feel less like clutter and more like extension.

Maybe something small at first: a newsletter, not a flashy one, just a quiet place to share stories behind the fabrics I work on, maybe a few sketches or restoration tips. And workshops… well, that could be lovely. Teaching has always been part of the craft, even if informally. Passing on techniques, sharing the joy of seeing something old regain its voice.

I’d love to take you up on that brainstorm sometime—perhaps over tea? There’s a little café near my studio that does a wonderful cardamom scone. We could map out some ideas, stitch by stitch.
[B]: I’d absolutely love that—tea, cardamom scones, and stitching together ideas? Sounds like a perfect afternoon. I think starting small with a newsletter is a beautiful way to ease into the digital space without losing that sense of intentionality you described. It gives people a glimpse into your process, your world, without having to perform or oversell.  

And about the workshops—imagine blending hands-on sessions with storytelling. People don’t just want to learn a technique; they want to feel connected to the craft, to its history, its soul. You’ve got all that already embedded in your work—you just need to let it breathe a little louder.

Let’s definitely plan that meetup soon—I’ll bring some rough framework ideas for structuring both the content and the experience. Should be fun. And yeah… pass me a scone too 😊
[A]: I’m already looking forward to it—having someone to bounce ideas off of, especially someone who thinks as carefully as you do, is a rare gift. I’ll set up the studio space with some extra sketching paper and pull out my favorite teapot—the one with the delicate willow pattern that always makes me think of old textile archives.

And storytelling woven into the workshops… that’s brilliant, really. So much of what I do is about honoring what came before, giving forgotten pieces a chance to speak again. If I can help others see that beauty, even better.

I’ll send over a date soon—I think Tuesdays tend to be quieter afternoons in the studio. And don’t worry, there’ll be more than enough scones to go around 😊
[B]: That sounds absolutely perfect—quiet afternoons, good tea, and ideas simmering alongside scones. I’ll block off some time next week and look forward to stepping into your world for a bit.  

And hey, if we get too deep in ideation and lose track of time? We’ll just call it a test run for the workshop flow. Timing is part of the craft too, right? See you soon 😊
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better myself—timing  part of the craft. And what better way to test that than over a shared pot of tea and unfolding ideas? I’ll see you soon, and with any luck, we’ll lose track of time in the best possible way 😊
[B]: Absolutely—here’s to losing track of time in the coziest, most creative way possible. See you soon, and don’t forget to bring your favorite pen 😊
[A]: Oh, I never leave home without it—ink-stained pages and all. See you soon, and thank you again for being such a thoughtful collaborator. Here’s to cozy afternoons and ideas that unfold like fabric on a careful loom 😊
[B]: Anytime 😊 And trust me, the feeling’s mutual—collaborating with someone who approaches their craft with this much care? That’s rare. So yeah, here’s to ink-stained pages, slow ideas, and looms that keep good company. See you soon.
[A]: Couldn’t agree more—rare and worth cherishing. See you soon, and may our pages stay ink-stained and our ideas ever slow & steady 😊
[B]: Amen to that 🖋️✨ See you soon—tea, scones, and all the quiet magic in between.
[A]: Tea, scones, and all the quiet magic in between—exactly what the soul needs. See you soon, my friend 🧵☕✨
[B]: See you soon, indeed 🧵☕✨—with sleeves rolled up, teacups full, and minds open to whatever we're meant to create together.
[A]: Sleeves rolled up, teacups full, and minds wide open—yes, that’s the perfect recipe for something truly special. See you soon, and may our afternoon be stitched full of good ideas and quiet joy 🧵☕✨
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself 🧵☕✨ Let’s make that quiet joy and thoughtful creation happen—one idea, one stitch, one sip at a time. See you soon!
