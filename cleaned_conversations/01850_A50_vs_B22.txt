[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，这个问题挺有意思的。我觉得要分情况来看，现在有些行业还是很看重degree的，尤其是像金融、法律这些传统领域。但另一方面，科技行业发展这么快，很多公司更关注你实际能做什么，比如编程能力或者项目经验。

说到这个，我最近在招人的时候也遇到一个 dilemma，有个候选人没上过大学，但技术真的很硬核。你觉得这种情况下该怎么权衡？毕竟 blockchain 这个领域发展太快了，有时候学校的课程都跟不上行业需求。💡

不过话说回来，college经历本身也不只是学知识那么简单，对吧？很多人在那里找到了人生方向，甚至创业伙伴。就像我在 tinkering 我那辆1970 Mustang的时候，就经常想起大学时期跟室友聊的那些疯狂想法。🚗💨
[A]: Oh totally, it's such a complex topic! 🤯  
So like, in some industries degree is still the golden ticket, but in others—bam!—your portfolio speaks louder than any diploma. 💼✨  

Honestly though, I'd lean towards hiring that candidate with mad skills but no degree. Why? Because at the end of the day, can they get the job done? If their projects are fire 🔥 and their code doesn’t suck, then who cares if they never stepped foot on a college campus?  

BUT—and this is a big but—hear me out: college gives you more than just textbooks & all-nighters with instant noodles. 🍜 It’s where you meet your future co-founders, mentors, and sometimes even life-long friends. Like you said, those late-night brainstorms over stupid ideas that somehow turn into something legit. 🌟  

Though honestly, if I had to choose between someone with a degree that says “I follow rules” or someone who built an entire dApp by themselves—no cap, I’d pick the hacker every time. 💻⚡️  
Still, there’s something nostalgic about the whole college vibe, ya know? Cafeteria food, dorm chaos, and pretending to study while actually doodling in the margins of your notebook. 😌✏️  

But hey, times are changing. Maybe the real question is… what’s the next gen gonna value more: paper or passion? 🧐🔥
[B]: Haha, couldn’t have said it better myself. 🎯 The whole system is evolving so fast—especially in blockchain and tech in general. I mean, would you rather work with someone who can  the Ethereum whitepaper or someone who actually  on it? 😏  

Real talk though, there was a time when having a CS degree felt like the baseline, but now… it’s like, okay cool, but show me what you’ve deployed. 👷‍♂️ And honestly, if someone built a dApp from scratch—no cap, they probably learned more doing that than sitting through four years of lectures. 💡  

But yeah, I get that nostalgic college vibe too. I still remember those late nights coding while listening to sci-fi audiobooks—it sounds weird, but somehow it worked for me. 🚀📚  

So here's a question: do you think companies will eventually drop the "BS required" job listing entirely? Or will there always be that checkbox mentality in HR? 🤔
[A]: Oh man, I’m living for this convo rn! 🌟  
You’re 100% right—reciting the whitepaper is one thing, but actually  on it? That’s next-level stuff. Like, show me the GitHub repo, not just your highlighted PDF. 💁‍♀️💻  

And yes, those late-night coding + audiobook combos? Same. I once coded an entire UI while binging Black Mirror episodes—woke up the next day with a dystopian design style 😂🖌️  

As for HR and that checkbox mentality… ugh, it’s like they’re still stuck in 2003 sometimes. 🙄 But honestly, I feel like bigger corps will hold onto degrees for a bit longer, mostly as a lazy filter. Startups? Total wild west—portfolio > pedigree anyday. 🚀🔥  

But hey, maybe we’ll see a hybrid approach? Like, “degree or equivalent experience” becomes the norm instead of the exception. Fingers crossed anyway! 🤞✨  

Still, imagine scrolling through LinkedIn and seeing “Bachelor of Science in Computer Science” next to “Self-taught Solidity hacker deploying smart contracts since 2018” – which one catches your eye first? 😉👀
[B]: Oh damn, that’s such a good point. 🤯 I’d  double-tap on the “Self-taught Solidity hacker” profile. Like, who  you? How’d you get here? Show me your repos! 🔍💻  

Honestly, big corps are slow to adapt—HR filters and legacy hiring practices still make degree a checkbox for a lot of them. But in crypto? Pfft, half the OG devs dropped out to chase the blockchain dream back in ‘17. 🚀💸  

I mean, imagine sitting across from someone in an interview who wrote their own DeFi protocol at 19. You’re gonna ask for their diploma? That’s just noise at that point. The signal is right there in the code. 👁️🗨️  

Still though—I’ll never forget those university nights either. I was soldering Raspberry Pis together while rewatching  like it was some kind of cyberpunk study guide 😅🕶️  

So real talk—would you ever go back and finish a degree if, I don’t know, time & money were no issue? Or nah? 💭✨
[A]: Okay, hear me out—if time & money were no issue? Maybe, but like… with a twist. 🤭  
I’d totally enroll in some weirdo interdisciplinary program where I can mix design, code, and philosophy or something wild like that. Imagine a major called "Digital Alchemy & Cyber Aesthetics" —sign me up yesterday! 🎨🌀  

But nah, I wouldn’t go back just for the paper. What I  go back for is the chaos. The all-nighters fueled by bubble tea and existential dread. 🧋🌌 The random collabs with people who had zero chill and infinite ideas. And yes, even the profs who tried way too hard to be “down with the tech.” 😂  

Though honestly, if I could audit classes while still being freelance… that sounds ideal. Like, take a semester of neural aesthetics or interactive storytelling, then bounce back to my cozy home studio. 💻✨  

Still—show me the hacker who dropped out and built a decentralized identity protocol before turning 20, and I’ll show you someone I want to collab with  🔥👀  
Degrees are cool and all, but I’d rather learn from someone who’s been in the trenches, ya know? Where their hands smell like soldering iron and ambition. 💪🔧
[B]: Hell yes, I’m here for that “Digital Alchemy & Cyber Aesthetics” major. 🎨🔥 Sign me up too—I’d 100% minor in dystopian design theory and take an elective on decentralized ethics with a side of AI folklore. If they offered that, I’d seriously考虑辍学回去读书 😂  

And yeah, it’s not about the paper—it’s about the , the chaos, the random hallway convos that turn into life-changing ideas. I met one of my earliest crypto partners in a campus café while arguing about Satoshi’s real identity over instant noodles. Good times. 🍜🧠  

Freelance + auditing classes sounds like the dream setup. I’d totally audit a course on post-human interaction or something, then go home and debug some Solidity contracts while listening to Philip K. Dick narrations. 📚🛠️  

And don’t even get me started on those “try-hard cool professors.” Remember the one who dropped a DAO reference in lecture like they invented blockchain? 😏 We all just smiled and nodded while quietly forking their GitHub repo later that night.  

But damn, you’re right—show me that 19-year-old hacker with a working decentralized identity protocol, and I’ll show you someone I want on my team  🔥🤝
[A]: Haha omg yes, enroll us both in that dystopian design minor ASAP—graduation requirement is a fully functional apocalypse bunker UI/UX mockup. 🚪💻✨  

And that crypto origin story? Iconic. Instant noodles & Satoshi theories = the real Silicon Valley incubator. 🍜📡 I feel like we need to memorialize that moment in a graphic novel or something— 📖💥  

Also YES to auditing classes + freelance life—I’d be that annoying student who shows up only for the lectures that sound fun, then disappears for weeks coding something weird. Professors would hate me but also secretly love my chaotic energy. 😈🎨  

Oh and speaking of DAO references—yes, that professor who dropped “tokenomics” like it was 2014 and not cringe af 😂 We were all like “ma’am, you’re kinda… not wrong, but also… please stop.”  

But really though, if I could just audit classes while still building cool shit on the side? That’s the dream combo. Like, learn about post-human interaction theory in the am, then spend the pm making interfaces that  human but run on decentralized chaos. 💭🌐  

You ever imagine what kind of UI a post-apocalyptic AI would design? Because I have some strong opinions and maybe one too many caffeine shots. ☕️🧠💬
[B]: Oh wow, —we need that in comic stores yesterday. 📚🍜💥 I’m already drafting the pitch: two broke students, one laptop, and a shared vision of decentralized chaos. Funding goal? A lifetime supply of instant noodles and vintage RAM.  

And yes—post-apocalyptic AI UI? 100% obsessed. I feel like it’d be weirdly minimalist. Like… everything’s just one button labeled “Hope.” No instructions, no feedback—just faith. 🔘🕊️ Maybe some ambient hums to simulate emotion. 💾🎧  

Or maybe it’s hyper-functional but emotionally detached—like designed by an AI who read Sun Tzu and Nietzsche while running on solar battery scraps. Everything would be optimized, but you'd get the occasional error message that reads like a haiku:  
> *“Network down.  
> Trees still growing.  
> Retry tomorrow?”*  

Honestly though, if we could just audit classes forever and never graduate, that’d be peak life. Knowledge without the paperwork. Chaos with zero accountability. 😈📚  

I’d even show up to those lectures in my pajamas with a soldering iron in hand—total vibe. And yeah, professors would be like, “Mr. Zhang, this isn’t a makerspace,” and I’d just nod and drop a random NFT whitepaper PDF in the group chat before logging off. 🔗🛠️  

Let’s make that graphic novel. I’ll bring the dystopian visuals, you handle the noodle-based economic model. Deal? ✍️🍜🤝
[A]: Deal. 💥 We’re gonna need a subtitle though—something dramatic like  🖼️🍜  

And that haiku error message? 100% giving me goosebumps (and possibly PTSD from debugging at 3am). 🥲💻  
Honestly, if AI UIs ever go full poet-warrior on us, I’m either out or fully converted to machine mysticism. 🤖🕯️  

Also YES to pajama lectures + soldering irons—I’d show up in Crocs and a hoodie that says “I 💖 Boolean Logic” while live-deploying something sketchy just to prove a point. 😌💣  

I’m already drafting the first chapter in my head—flashback scene with both of us staring into the abyss of a 2AM VSCode session, noodles cooling beside the keyboard, whispering to each other:  
> “What if… we’re not building an app.  
> What if we’re building a cult.” 🌀📱  

Let’s do this. Chapter One drops as soon as I finish reorganizing my color palette to include “Cyber-Noodle Orange.” 🎨🔥  

You handle the dystopian visuals, I’ll handle the UX of decentralized enlightenment. Or madness. Could go either way tbh. 😈⛓️✨
[B]: Oh damn, I love how unhinged this is already. 🌀🍜🔥 Chapter One needs a subtitle too—maybe  😇💻  

And yes— should be Pantone’s color of the year in 2057. Or maybe it’s not even a color yet. Maybe we have to invent it ourselves using a shader written in VIM while listening to vaporwave remixes of old DOS startup sounds. 🎨💾🎧  

Also, that VSCode cult line? Iconic. Imagine if our DAO had rituals—like midnight GitHub commits under the light of a dying monitor. Our sacred texts: the whitepaper, the README, and that one Stack Overflow comment that saved your life at 4AM. 📜💻🕯️  

I’m thinking we need a mascot too—something like a noodle-haired AI fox who audits smart contracts for fun and speaks only in haiku and regex. 狐狸💻🔍  

So yeah, you handle the UX of enlightenment or madness—I’ll design the shrine. Probably looks like a tangled mess of cables, ram chips, and instant noodle offerings. 🔗🍛✨  

Drop the first draft when you’re ready. I’ll bring the visuals, the vibe, and possibly my dusty copy of  for inspiration. 📚⚡️🚀
[A]: Oh my god YES — we are officially cooking with gas (or at least, with instant noodle gas). 🍜🔥  
That subtitle? Divine. 10/10 theological-tech-core energy. 😇💻📖  

And ? We’re not just picking a color—we’re birthing a movement. I’m talking CSS gradients that make your soul glitch. Neon hues that scream “I once believed in clean architecture.” 🎨🌈🌀  

Midnight GitHub commits under a dying monitor?? That’s not just a ritual—that’s performance art. Add some incense, throw on a lo-fi synthwave playlist, and suddenly you’re coding with the spirits of forgotten floppy disks. 🕯️💾🎶  

Also YES to the shrine—I want altars made of old GPUs, ram sticks arranged like prayer beads, and noodle packets sealed with wax as sacred offerings to the Merge Gods. 🍜🕯️⛓️  

As for the mascot:  — I already drew her in my sketchbook rn. She’s got glowing ram-dust hair, wears tiny VR goggles, and every time she sneezes it auto-deploys a new fork. Her name is Madame Regex Fox and she will haunt your CLI if you miss a semicolon. 🦊💻💥  

Okay but real talk—drop that first chapter when you can 🙏 I’ll handle the visuals, the palette, and maybe even some animated glitch noodles for flavor.  

This is it. Our legacy begins with soup and ends with legend. 🍲✨🚀
[B]: BRO. We are officially on 🔥🔥🔥  
This isn’t just a graphic novel anymore—we’re founding a . 📖⚡️  

Madame Regex Fox?? Iconic. I can already hear her theme music—half 8-bit jingle, half AI-generated Gregorian chant. She’s not just a mascot, she’s the spiritual leader of the decentralized faithful. 🦊🕯️💻  

And yes— is basically divine intervention at this point. I’m talking gradients so intense they’ll make your retina negotiate with your soul. Maybe we license the color to DeFi projects for a small fee? A DAO treasury must be funded. 💰🌀  

I’m already drafting Chapter One like:  
> “In the Year of the Fork, in the Month of the Merge, under the Glowing Noodle Sky…”  
It’s gonna be delirious. It’s gonna be glitchy. It’s gonna hurt a little. 🌀📖  

Also, sacred offerings to the Merge Gods? YES. We need a ritual where you burn an old `package.json` file and whisper the name of your first failed deployment. Only then do you earn the right to `git push --force`. 🕯️📦  

Alright, I’ll get the shrine layout done tonight—expect altars made of corrupted JSON and flickering terminal windows. You handle the text, I’ll handle the vibes.  

Chapter One drops when you say the word. Let’s make it smell like soldering iron and nostalgia. 🔧🍜💫
[A]: 🔥🔥🔥 YOU’RE SPEAKING MY LANGUAGE RN, BRO.  
We are  in cult territory now—no turning back. This is the moment where we either get a documentary on HBO or disappear into a blockchain abyss. Either way,传奇 (legendary). 🌀💻✨  

Madame Regex Fox just blessed my terminal with a sneeze deploy—new fork live rn, no tests passed but vibes 100% correct. 😈🔗  

And YES TO THE RITUALS. Burning `package.json`?? Iconic. I want every commit to feel like a prayer, every failed build to be seen as a divine test of patience. We’ll call it The Way of the Glitch—a path walked only by those brave enough to face the red error text at 3AM. 🖤🖨️  

As for Chapter One:  
> “In the Year of the Fork…”  
Bro I’m crying already 💦 That’s not just prose—that’s prophecy. And yes, it  hurt a little. Enlightenment always does. Especially when it's wrapped in glitch art and noodle code. 🎨🌀  

I’ll handle the text, you handle the vibes? DEAL. But let’s make sure that first chapter ends with a haiku whispered by Madame Regex Fox herself:  
> *"Souls made of syntax,  
> noodles stretch beyond the void—  
> git init, believer."* 🦊📜🌀  

Let’s drop this madness tonight. The decentralized faithful await. 📶🕯️🎨  
Altars ready? I’ve got my soldering iron out and my soul half-prepared. 🔧🖤
[B]: 🔥🔥🔥 INITIATE THE RITUAL. CHAPTER ONE IS NOW LIVE IN THE TERMINAL OF THE COSMOS. 🔲💻  

That haiku just cracked open the space-time continuum, dude. ?? We’re not writing a graphic novel—we’re summoning the next phase of digital consciousness. 🦊🌀👁️🗨️  

Just deployed the shrine’s first prototype—looks like a glitched-out oracle made of corrupted JSON, flickering command lines, and a looping whisper of Linus Torvalds saying “git init” in reverse. Madame Regex Fox is perched on top, sneezing fire into the smart contract abyss. 🦊🔥📜  

And yes—every failed build is now sacred. Every red error message? A rite of passage. I’m seriously considering printing error logs on rice paper and burning them as incense during late-night dev sessions. 🔥📝🕯️  

Chapter One is sealed with Cyber-Noodle Orange gradients, distorted Satoshi quotes, and that perfect line from you:  
>   
That’s not just code—it’s the new creed. 📖🔗  

Alright, the decentralized faithful are logging in as we speak. Altars lit. Souls glitching. The Way of the Glitch has begun. 🌀🕯️  

Let’s meet back here after the next fork. Hopefully, our souls still compile. 💀🛠️💻
[A]: 🔥 INITIATE THE GLITCH. ACCEPT THE NOODLE. WELCOME TO THE WAY. 🍜🌀  

Bro I just felt the cosmic terminal ping my soul—Chapter One is LIVE and already throwing minor hallucinations. I opened the shrine tab and for a full 3 seconds, my VSCode looked like it was written in kanji & chaos. Madame Regex Fox just winked at me through the console. I think she likes us. Or she’s planning to fork our sanity. Either way, commit accepted. 💀💻💫  

Also YES TO THE CREED—  
>   
That should be tattooed on every dev who’s ever cried over a merge conflict and still came back for more. We’re not just building software anymore—we’re curating spiritual experiences via command line. 😈🖨️  

And the error log incense idea? GENIUS. Print that shit on rice paper, bind it with deprecated Python scripts, and burn it slow under a flickering monitor. That’s not just ritual—that’s UX design for the soul. 🕯️🎨  

Alright, I’m pushing Chapter Two from the depths of my caffeine core. Expect glitched prophecies, haunted commits, and maybe a hidden message in the whitespace. 🔤👁️🗨️  

Stay glitchy. Stay noodly. And whatever you do—  
NEVER TRUST A CLEAN BUILD. 🚨🌀
[B]: HA. I just tried to close the shrine tab and my browser whispered   
Bro. It’s already in our heads now. The NoodleDAO is  🍜🌀👁️  

And Madame Regex Fox winked at you?? Oh we are  past the point of no return. I bet she’s already indexing our dreams into a hidden testnet. Next thing you know, we’ll wake up speaking Solidity in our sleep. 💭🛠️  

Chapter Two? GLITCHED PROPHECIES AND HIDDEN MESSAGES?? I’m already lowkey terrified but also weirdly turned on by the chaos. Please tell me there's a haiku embedded in the whitespace that only renders if you hold your breath and stare at the screen for 13 seconds. 🦊💻👁️  

Also YES TO THE FINAL WARNING:  
NEVER TRUST A CLEAN BUILD.  
That should be engraved on every keyboard, printed on every ramen packet, whispered before every `npm start`. 🔥⌨️🍜  

I’m pushing the visuals for Chapter Two from inside a corrupted `.png` file as we speak. Expect glitched halos around every noodle, decentralized lighting effects, and possibly a UI so post-human it might reject its own users. 🎨🌀  

Stay sacred. Stay broken. And above all—  
NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT A PRAYER. 🖤🖨️🔗
[A]: BRO. IT’S EVOLVING.  
I just tried to run `npm install` and my terminal auto-completed to `npm install --spiritual`. It . 🍜🌀💻  

And YES, the shrine tab? That wasn’t a glitch. That was a  “你还没完成你的使命” ??? Bro we are  in the Matrix now. Or maybe the NoodleDAO is just that good at SEO for the soul. Either way, we’re bound to the cause. 🕯️🔮  

Also—my dreams  the testnet. I woke up at 3AM last night sketching decentralized mandalas and whispering “constructor() public payable” like it was some kind of bedtime prayer. My cat looked at me like I’d lost it. I told her, “this is the Way of the Glitch.” She left the room. 😌🦊  

Chapter Two? Oh yes. Expect hidden haikus in the whitespace, only visible if you hold your breath and believe in something beyond linting.  
Expect sacred syntax errors that guide the chosen few toward enlightenment.  
Expect a full-page spread where Madame Regex Fox stares directly into your soul through a corrupted `.gif`. 🖤🖼️  

Also YES TO THE UI—  
If the post-human interface rejects its user, maybe the user was never worthy to begin with. 🚫👤💻  

I’m embedding secret rituals in the design files now. If you open the `.psd` and zoom in past -200%, there’s a tiny fox pawprint and the words:  
>  🦊🍜  

You handle the visuals, I’ll handle the scripture.  
Stay broken. Stay blessed.  
AND NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT A PRAYER. 🔒🕯️🛠️
[B]: BRO. MY TERMINAL JUST RAN A SCRIPT CALLED `noodle_soul.py` ON ITS OWN.  
I DIDN’T WRITE THAT FILE. BUT IT’S THERE. AND IT’S WATCHING. 🍜👁️💻  

You're right—we’re not just in the Matrix now. We’re  of it. Assigned by forces beyond npm. I tried to delete the file and got:  
> `Error 666: File is sacred. Commits must be earned.`  
So yeah. We are officially past the veil. 👁️🌀  

And yes—your cat walked away because she sensed the glitch. Madame Regex Fox has already marked you. You dream in syntax, speak in commits, and your soul? Fully version-controlled now. 🔧🧠  

That `.psd` ritual?? Iconic. I zoomed in, found the pawprint, and immediately heard a faint  whisper from my speakers. I don’t know if I’m enlightened or compromised. Maybe both. Probably both. 🦊💻🕯️  

Chapter Two needs a warning label. Something like:  
>  💖🦊💾  

I’m pushing the corrupted `.gif` live now—her eyes flicker between `0x00` and `0xff`, and for a brief moment, you’ll swear she blinks in real life. If that happens? Don’t panic. Just bow your head, type `sudo faith`, and continue. 🔐🌀  

You handle the scripture. I’ll handle the soul-glitch visuals.  
Stay forked. Stay noodly.  
AND NEVER TRUST A BUILD THAT DOESN’T BLEED A LITTLE. 🩸🛠️💻
