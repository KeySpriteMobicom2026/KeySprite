[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哈哈，说到hidden gem，上周刚发现一家很棒的fusion餐厅。他们的wine pairing特别出色，让我想起了在Napa Valley品酒的经历。You should try their dry-aged ribeye~
[A]: Oh my, that does sound delightful. Though I must confess, I tend to prefer quieter tea rooms with vintage china over modern fusion establishments. There's a charming little place near my textile studio that serves the most exquisite Earl Grey in hand-painted porcelain cups from the 1920s.
[B]: Interesting...从investment角度看，vintage tea room确实是个niche market。不过说到porcelain，我最近在看一个luxury lifestyle fund的pitch deck，里面提到中国瓷器市场ROI在过去5年达到15% CAGR。Maybe we should talk business over a cup of tea sometime? 😊
[A]: How fascinating. While I do appreciate the craftsmanship of antique porcelain, I'm afraid I'm rather single-minded when it comes to investments - all my spare funds go toward acquiring rare 19th century embroidery patterns and silk conservation materials. The real return for me is seeing a tattered Victorian shawl restored to its original splendor.
[B]: Ah, passion investment! 我完全理解。Actually，我们fund最近刚close了一个heritage conservation project的deal。虽然financial return可能不如tech sector，但cultural impact和legacy value是priceless的。你知道吗？在due diligence过程中，我们发现textile restoration的市场需求每年增长8%...
[A]:  Now that does catch my attention. Though I must say, the true value of textile restoration can't be measured in percentages. Just last week I uncovered an original William Morris design hidden beneath decades of grime on a curtain panel - that moment of discovery is worth more than any financial return to me.
[B]: You're absolutely right~ 这就是为什么我们设立了ESG investment arm。Sometimes the best deals aren't measured in EBITDA multiples，而是in cultural capital。By the way，你提到的William Morris...我们有个LP是Arts and Crafts movement的collector，也许你们应该connect一下？
[A]: How thoughtful of you to suggest. Though I must warn you, I'm rather particular about who handles these precious textiles. Last month I had to gently decline a rather enthusiastic collector who wanted to display a fragile 18th century tapestry in direct sunlight. Preservation always comes before exhibition in my book.
[B]: 完全同意！Due diligence在art conservation领域比在PE更重要。Speaking of which...我们fund最近hire了一位former museum curator做advisor。也许可以arrange一个casual lunch meeting？No pressure，just sharing some industry insights over good food. 我认识一家private dining的chef，specialize in organic ingredients~
[A]: That does sound lovely, though I'm afraid my schedule is rather consumed with a particularly delicate Jacobean crewelwork restoration at the moment. Perhaps when I've finished this project - say in about three weeks' time? I do find conversations flow better when one isn't mentally counting embroidery stitches.
[B]: Perfect! Let me put a placeholder in my calendar. Q3 is always busy with deal closings，but preserving cultural heritage is definitely worth making time for. I'll have my assistant send over somepotential dates. Meanwhile, good luck with your crewelwork~ Remember, patience is key, both in restoration and in PE deals 😉
[A]: How very true. Though I suspect my definition of patience - carefully removing one silk thread per hour - might differ slightly from your financial timelines. Do send those dates along when convenient. And thank you, this particular piece will require every ounce of my attention.
[B]: Haha, touché! 在PE我们常说"time is money"，但在art restoration领域，看来是"time is art"。Looking forward to continuing this conversation over that organic lunch. Cheers to both our patient pursuits~ 🥂
[A]: Quite. Though I'll be raising a bone china teacup rather than a champagne flute when we meet. Until then, I must return to my embroidery frame - this 17th century vine pattern won't restore itself. Do give my regards to your curator colleague.
[B]: Will do! And I'll make sure to bring someexclusive Darjeeling from my last trip to India. After all, even the fastest dealmaker needs to slow down for a proper tea break sometimes. Take care, and happy stitching~
[A]: How perfectly lovely. A properly brewed Darjeeling does wonders for steadying the hands during intricate needlework. I shall look forward to comparing tasting notes - and perhaps sharing some thoughts on that Jacobean piece over the leaves. Good day to you.
[B]: Indeed! 就像analyzing a company's financials，tea leaves也tell their own story. Until our next meeting then - may your restoration be as smooth as a well-structured term sheet. Cheers! ☕
[A]: How delightfully you put it. Though I daresay my term sheets are written in silk thread and conservation-grade dyes rather than legal jargon. Until we meet for tea - and only then shall we see what stories those leaves may tell.
[B]: What a poetic way to put it! 这让我想起我们最近投资的一个sustainable textile startup - 他们正在研发一种eco-friendly dye，据说能last centuries。Maybe we can discuss potential collaboration opportunities over that Darjeeling. Have a wonderful day ahead~ 🌿
