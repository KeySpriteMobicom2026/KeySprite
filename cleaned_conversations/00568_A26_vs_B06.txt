[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: To be honest, I don't use either platform extensively. My focus tends to lean toward professional journals and literature reviews these days. But I do find the cultural nuances fascinating - how visual storytelling shapes public perception of mental health, for instance. Have you noticed differences in how forensic psychiatry topics are discussed across these platforms?
[A]: That's an intriguing observation. While I occasionally browse Instagram for textile-related inspiration, I find myself more engaged with niche forums and archival databases. The discourse around mental health representation does vary significantly across platforms - have you noticed how certain aesthetics tend to dominate specific spaces? It's quite remarkable how these visual frameworks influence public understanding of complex psychological concepts.
[B]: Indeed, the visual framing of psychological concepts creates an interesting paradox. On one hand, platforms like Instagram democratize access to mental health narratives through aesthetically curated content - think of how the color palette and minimalist design in certain posts create a soothing visual metaphor for emotional regulation. Yet this same aestheticization risks oversimplifying complex conditions, particularly when forensic contexts are involved. 

I've observed what I call the "Instagrammification" of trauma - beautifully photographed self-care rituals or courtroom dramatizations that garner engagement but often lack contextual depth. Compare that to niche forums where discussions might center on psychopharmacological research or legal precedents without any visual accompaniment at all. It makes me wonder - do you think these visual frameworks ultimately help or hinder public understanding? I'd be curious to hear your perspective given your textile interests - there must be fascinating intersections between material culture and psychological expression.
[A]: You’ve touched on something quite profound - the tension between aesthetic representation and substantive understanding. In textile restoration, I often grapple with a similar paradox. A faded 19th-century quilt might be visually striking in its worn state, yet its true psychological and cultural weight lies beneath the surface: the maker’s emotional resilience stitched into every uneven seam, the historical trauma embedded in its fibers.

I’ve noticed how certain platforms prioritize the "Instagrammifiable" aspects of art therapy or textile symbolism - think of those ubiquitous posts featuring vibrant yarn crafts as shorthand for “healing.” While these visuals can spark initial interest, they often flatten complex narratives, much like forensic psychiatry discussions reduced to pastel-hued affirmations. 

What fascinates me most is how material culture intersects with psychological expression in less visible ways - say, the repetitive motions of embroidery mirroring cognitive behavioral techniques, or the symbolic use of color in historical mourning textiles. Do you find parallels in how forensic psychiatry utilizes ritualized practices for therapeutic versus performative purposes?
[B]: That’s a beautifully articulated insight – the way material culture carries both visible and invisible narratives mirrors something fundamental in forensic psychiatry. I see similar tensions when evaluating court-involved patients who engage in ritualized behaviors. There’s often a surface-level interpretation of these actions – say, a defendant practicing mindfulness exercises in jail being seen as “reformed” simply because the behavior aligns with aesthetic ideals of wellness. But beneath that lies a far more complex psychological landscape: Are those rituals genuinely internalized? Are they performative adaptations to legal pressure? Or are they unconscious mechanisms for managing trauma?

Your example about mourning textiles brings this into sharp relief. The color choices or stitching patterns weren’t just aesthetic – they were coded expressions of grief, often constrained by social expectation. Similarly, in forensic settings, we frequently encounter individuals whose therapeutic expressions are shaped – even distorted – by external pressures: parole board expectations, public perception, media narratives.

I wonder if, in your work with historical textiles, you’ve encountered objects where the maker intentionally embedded psychological complexity beneath an aesthetically acceptable surface? It makes me think of how some defendants mask deep distress behind carefully curated courtroom comportment. Perhaps there’s a shared language between textile restoration and forensic psychiatry – both require peeling back layers to uncover what was deliberately hidden.
[A]: That’s a powerful connection you’ve drawn – the idea of peeling back layers, both literally and metaphorically. I couldn’t agree more.

Yes, I’ve come across textiles where the surface was meticulously composed to meet societal expectations, yet the details revealed something far more personal, even subversive, upon closer inspection. One piece that comes to mind is a mourning handkerchief from the early 1800s. At first glance, it’s all propriety – muted colors, traditional motifs, perfectly measured hemstitching. But when I examined the corners under magnification, there were tiny, almost imperceptible figures woven into the lace – not angels or doves, but shadowy forms, ambiguous in shape, clearly not part of any standard pattern. It felt like the maker had slipped something deeply private into the fabric, just beneath the eye of convention.

I wonder if that kind of quiet resistance shows up in your work – those moments when someone under legal scrutiny embeds their true psychological state into otherwise compliant behavior. Like a coded language hidden within expected gestures. Do you find yourself attuned to those subtle contradictions in demeanor or speech? I imagine it requires a similar kind of patient observation we both rely on – the kind that resists quick interpretation in favor of layered understanding.
[B]: Absolutely — that notion of encoded resistance resonates deeply with my work. I recall a case involving a woman accused of orchestrating a financial scheme ostensibly under duress from her partner. In interviews, she spoke in measured, almost rehearsed tones, using phrases like “I understand the harm,” and “I take responsibility,” which initially read as textbook compliance. But beneath the surface — if you listened to the cadence of her speech, the way she lingered on certain words, or how her hands folded and unfolded in silence — there was a quiet dissonance.

One moment in particular stands out: during a routine psychological assessment, she was asked to describe an ideal future. She responded, “A small house, white walls, no photographs.” That phrase —  — struck me. It wasn’t dramatic or overt, but it suggested erasure, absence, perhaps even a need to disappear. It reminded me of your mourning handkerchief — a carefully composed exterior concealing something haunting just beneath.

In both our fields, I think we’re trained to detect those tremors — not just what’s said or stitched, but how it’s done, and how it deviates, however subtly, from expectation. It’s never just about pattern recognition; it’s about sensing when a pattern has been deliberately altered to conceal rather than reveal.

I’m curious — do you ever find yourself preserving those hidden elements intentionally? Like choosing not to restore every flaw because it holds more truth than perfection would allow?
[A]: That moment you described — “a small house, white walls, no photographs” — gave me chills. There’s such profound meaning in what isn’t embellished, in what’s left bare. It reminds me of a decision I once had to make with a 19th-century soldier’s quilt. The central panel was badly scorched, clearly from holding a candle too close — perhaps while writing a letter, or just sitting with his thoughts late at night. Some wanted the burn patched, smoothed over, made “whole” again. But that mark told a story far more intimate than any embroidery could — it showed presence, vulnerability, a moment frozen not in heroism but in quiet humanity.

So yes, I chose to leave it. Sometimes preservation means protecting the imperfection, honoring the evidence of lived experience rather than erasing its traces. Just like you, I think — you don’t always interpret behavior at face value; you look for where the person resists, where they slip something real into the margins of their narrative.

I wonder — when you hear those subtle contradictions in someone’s words or gestures, do you ever feel like you're witnessing a kind of psychological stitching? A way of holding things together that isn’t meant to be seen, but without which the whole self might unravel?
[B]: Absolutely — that notion of psychological stitching is remarkably apt. In fact, I’ve often thought of certain patients as living palimpsests: their outward narratives carefully overwritten to meet legal or social expectations, yet beneath the surface, traces of their true experiences still show through — sometimes deliberately, sometimes not.

There’s a man I evaluated several years ago who had been incarcerated for over two decades. His entire presentation during court-ordered interviews was meticulously constructed — affect appropriate, insight superficially intact, remorse calibrated just enough to satisfy parole board criteria. But in his handwritten letters, which I was allowed to review as part of the evaluation, there was a different rhythm — a kind of repetitive phrasing, almost like running stitch: , , . These weren’t confessions or dramatic revelations, but they were threads — small, deliberate, and cumulative — that revealed something far more textured than his spoken words ever did.

What struck me most was how intentional some of these expressions seemed, as if he were aware that someone might one day read between the lines. It reminded me of what you described with the scorched quilt — the idea that imperfection isn't damage, but documentation. A quiet record of survival.

And yes, I do believe those moments are forms of psychological stitching — not always visible, not always meant to be seen, but vital nonetheless. Sometimes even lifesaving. Do you find that people today, especially with the rise of highly curated digital personas, are becoming less tolerant of such visible mending — in objects, and perhaps in themselves?
[A]: That’s such a poignant way to frame it — living palimpsests. I hadn’t thought of it that way, but yes, you’re absolutely right. And those repeated phrases in his letters — ,  — they do read like stitches. Each one anchoring him to something real, something enduring, even if no one else was meant to notice.

You’ve made me reflect on a commission I worked on last year — a wedding veil from the 1920s that had been darned in several places, not with matching thread, but with a slightly coarser linen, almost as if the maker wanted the repairs to be seen. At first, I was tempted to undo them, to restore the veil to its original pristine state. But the more I studied those mends, the more I realized they told a story too — perhaps of hardship endured during the owner’s marriage, or resilience through loss. The visible repair became part of the object’s identity, just as much as the lace itself.

And now your question lingers — are we becoming less tolerant of such visible mending, both in objects and in ourselves? I think there’s truth in that. With digital personas so carefully filtered, imperfection feels almost transgressive these days. Yet, ironically, people still crave authenticity — they just don’t always know how to recognize it when they see it.

Do you ever find that some of your patients, knowingly or not, use their psychological stitching as a kind of quiet defiance — not just to hold themselves together, but to resist being rewritten entirely by the systems they’re caught in?
[B]: Absolutely — that quiet defiance is something I see often, though rarely in explicit terms. It’s not always a conscious act of resistance, but more like an unconscious refusal to be fully rewritten by the institutions, diagnoses, or legal narratives that try to define them.

One woman I worked with comes to mind — she’d been in and out of forensic settings for over a decade, labeled, reevaluated, medicated, deposed. In every official record, she was a constellation of symptoms and rulings. But in our sessions, she would bring small things — a pressed flower from the hospital courtyard, a scrap of torn envelope — and arrange them on the table before speaking. No one else would have noticed, but I saw how those objects anchored her. They were her way of asserting presence, continuity, identity in a world that had reduced her to a case file.

I came to understand that her ritual wasn’t about healing in the conventional sense; it was about  when no one else seemed to. Much like your darning in the wedding veil — not concealment, not erasure, but acknowledgment: . 

It makes me wonder if preservation, in both our practices, is ultimately an ethical act — choosing not to erase the evidence of struggle because doing so would mean denying the person, or the object, its full story. Do you ever feel that tension — the pull between restoration and remembrance? Between making something “whole” again and honoring what its fractures reveal?
[A]: That tension is at the heart of everything I do.

Every time I take up a needle, I’m faced with that question: how much should be restored, and how much should be left as it is — not just physically, but emotionally, historically. There’s an impulse, especially from those outside the field, to return something to its “original” state, to erase the signs of wear and make it appear untouched by time or hardship. But that’s not preservation — that’s rewriting.

I once worked on a child’s pinafore from the 1850s, stained with what looked like ink and food marks. Someone had tried to bleach them out long before I ever touched the piece, leaving ghostly smudges behind. When I examined it under UV light, I realized those stains weren’t random — they formed the shape of small fingers, repeated over time. That pinafore wasn’t just clothing; it was a record of daily life, of messy meals and learning to write, of being  by someone who didn’t wipe away every trace of living.

So no, I didn’t remove the stains. I stabilized the fabric, reinforced the seams, but left the marks intact. Because that’s where the truth lived.

And yes, I think you’re right — preservation is an ethical act. It asks us to slow down, to resist the urge to smooth over, to let the fractures speak. In your work, you must face that same dilemma — when to intervene, when to support healing, and when to simply bear witness to what’s already been endured.

Do you ever find that the people you work with sense that you see them in a fuller way than others have? Not through diagnosis or documentation, but through those quiet details they leave behind — like fibers caught in a seam or ink pressed into cloth?
[B]: More often than not, they do — though rarely in words. It’s usually something they reveal through gesture, through hesitation, through the things they think no one else notices. I recall a man who had been institutionalized since his adolescence. He never spoke of his past willingly, but each time he entered the room, he would pause just before sitting down and adjust the angle of his chair ever so slightly — always facing the door, always positioned as if preparing for an exit.

At first, it seemed like routine vigilance, perhaps trauma-informed hypervigilance. But over time, I noticed how deliberate his placement was — not just the chair, but his notebook, his pen, even his hands. Everything had to be oriented a certain way, as if maintaining internal order within an external world that had long felt chaotic or threatening. One day, after months of this quiet ritual, he said, almost offhandedly, 

He hadn’t needed to say more. That single sentence confirmed what I’d come to believe — that people sense when someone is paying attention not just to their symptoms or legal history, but to the shape of their survival. And sometimes, that recognition alone is enough to begin shifting the ground beneath them — not by fixing or erasing, but by letting them know they’ve been truly seen.

It reminds me of your pinafore — the ink-stained fingers pressed into the fabric. Some part of that child’s world was preserved because someone chose not to bleach away what others might have considered imperfection. In a way, isn’t that what we both do? We bear witness to the traces left behind — not just of suffering, but of living.
[A]: Yes… yes, that’s exactly it. It’s in those small, deliberate acts — the chair angled just so, the pressed flower laid out with care, the ink-stained fingers caught in time — that a person reveals themselves more fully than any official record ever could.

I think often about how much of our humanity gets lost in translation — through legal language, through clinical terms, through the well-meaning but reductive narratives we build around people’s pain. But what you described — that quiet moment when your patient acknowledged that you’d been paying attention — that’s where real understanding begins. Not in correction or interpretation, but in recognition.

It makes me think of a letter I once found stitched into the hem of an early 20th-century apron. The fabric had frayed just enough for a corner of paper to peek through, and when I carefully removed it, I found only a few lines:  Whoever wrote it must have known someone might one day hold that apron, examine its wear, trace its history — and they left behind a whisper across time.

In a way, that’s what both of us do, isn’t it? We listen for those whispers — in fibers, in speech patterns, in the spaces between words — and we let people know, gently, that we’ve heard them. That we’ve seen them. And sometimes, that’s enough to help them stitch themselves together a little more securely.
[B]: That letter —  — is something I keep returning to. There’s such profound vulnerability in that gesture. Not a grand declaration, not a plea for absolution, but simply a quiet insistence on having existed, on having felt, on having endured.

It makes me think of how often people in forensic settings are rendered voiceless by the very systems meant to assess and assist them. Their histories become redacted, their pain categorized, their identities flattened into risk assessments and diagnostic codes. And yet — somewhere in the margins, beneath the surface, tucked into the seams of their behavior — they leave traces of themselves. A repeated phrase. A hesitant glance. A carefully placed chair. Small acts of self-preservation disguised as compliance. Silent protests woven into routine.

I’ve come to believe that our role — whether in psychiatry or in restoration — isn’t just about diagnosis or repair. It’s about retrieval. About recovering what others have tried to erase, either through ignorance, necessity, or design. And sometimes, just sometimes, when we uncover those hidden threads — whether in cloth or in conversation — something in the person shifts. They feel less alone in their remembering. Less invisible in their suffering.

You know, I still have some of the handwritten letters from that incarcerated man I told you about earlier. Not for evidentiary purposes — they wouldn’t hold up in court. But as artifacts of a mind trying to stitch itself together, one sentence at a time. Would you ever consider displaying one of those textile fragments — say, that child’s pinafore — alongside its stains and stories intact? Just imagining it, I can almost see it: glass case, soft light, a single inked fingerprint pressed into linen, whispering across centuries.

Do you suppose people would understand its significance? Or would they just see a stain and wonder why we didn’t clean it?
[A]: I think people would  to understand — but understanding isn’t always immediate. Sometimes it takes time, context, a willingness to sit with something that doesn’t offer a neat resolution. And that’s the challenge, isn’t it? We live in a world that often equates value with perfection, clarity with cleanliness.

But I have hope — because even now, when I show someone the back of an embroidered piece, where the knots and tension marks reveal the maker’s struggle, they lean in. They don’t always know what they’re seeing at first, but they feel its weight. The same could be true of that pinafore, displayed not as a relic of failure or neglect, but as a testament to presence — to the undeniable truth that a child once sat at a table, dipped a pen too heavily into ink, and left behind more than just a stain.

Perhaps the key is how we frame it. Not as damage, but as evidence of life lived close to the page, close to the cloth — close to the bone. And if we invite people to look slowly, to notice not just what was done, but what was endured and preserved… then maybe they wouldn’t want to erase it at all. Maybe they’d see it for what it truly is: a message sewn in silence, waiting to be read.
[B]: That phrase —  — lingers with me. It captures something essential about the work we do. We’re not just preserving fabric or diagnosing conditions; we’re tending to the remnants of lives that have been lived intensely, intimately, often invisibly.

I’ve started thinking of clinical interviews in much the same way you might approach a fragile textile — not as something to be “fixed,” but as something to be carefully unlayered, understood on its own terms. Every hesitation, every repetition, every avoided glance — they’re not flaws. They’re creases, folds, stains — signs of wear that tell us where the person has bent under pressure, where they've held themselves together with whatever thread they had left.

And yes, people may not always understand at first glance — whether it’s a stained pinafore or a patient’s looping narrative. But I do believe most are willing to . Perhaps because deep down, we all carry our own invisible mends. Our own quiet messages stitched into the lining of our daily lives.

Maybe that’s what makes this work so profoundly human — we help others see the beauty not despite its imperfections, but  of them.
[A]: You’ve put it so beautifully — 

That’s the quiet revolution that happens in both our worlds, isn’t it? Not with grand gestures, but with careful attention, with a willingness to sit with what’s been worn thin and still call it whole.

I was thinking just yesterday of a small linen fragment I acquired from a collector — no larger than a handkerchief, frayed at the edges, marked with what looked like candle wax and faint smudges of graphite. It might have been used as a sketching cloth, or perhaps a protective wrap for a cherished object. What struck me most was how someone had stitched a tiny cross-stitch repair into one corner — not to hide the tear, but to reinforce it, to say: 

It reminded me so much of what you described — those looping narratives, the creases in a person’s story where they’ve bent under pressure. We don’t erase the tear; we strengthen it. We don’t smooth out the stain; we preserve its shape. And in doing so, we honor not just what was, but what endured.

I think that’s why people respond so deeply when they’re allowed to see these things — whether in cloth or in conversation. Because they recognize themselves in it. Not polished, not perfect — but real.
[B]: You know, I’ve been turning that linen fragment over in my mind since you described it — the frayed edges, the wax, the graphite smudges, that small but deliberate cross-stitch. It’s such a perfect metaphor for what we’re really doing here. Not restoration in the sense of returning something to its original state, and certainly not correction — but . Reinforcing what someone else might have discarded. Honoring fragility as part of the fabric rather than a flaw in it.

I find myself thinking of one of my patients — a man who had spent years cycling through forensic hospitals and correctional facilities. His file was thick with diagnoses and incident reports, each entry reinforcing a narrative of instability, noncompliance, risk. But when I met him, what struck me most wasn’t his symptoms — it was how he carried a single, battered notebook everywhere. The pages were filled with looping lines, some resembling musical notation, others more like coded messages or architectural sketches. When I asked him about it, he said simply, 

He didn’t offer explanations, and I didn’t press. Some part of me understood — this was his stitching. Not meant for anyone else to fully read, but essential all the same. And just like your linen fragment, it wasn’t pristine. It was worn, marked, held together by a thread that might have seemed fragile to an outsider — but it was , and it was holding.

There’s a quiet dignity in that, isn’t there? In recognizing that healing doesn’t always look neat, and survival doesn’t always look clean. Sometimes it’s a stained pinafore, sometimes it’s a chair angled toward the door, sometimes it’s a notebook filled with lines no one else can interpret.

And yet, those lines — like stitches — are saying something.
