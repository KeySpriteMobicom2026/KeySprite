[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a delightful question! You know, I’ve been thinking about this very topic quite a bit lately. There’s something so satisfying about discovering those quiet, unassuming places that serve up something truly extraordinary.  

Just last week, I stumbled upon a little spot tucked away in a part of town I don’t often visit. It wasn’t much to look at from the outside—hardly any signage, just a small handwritten menu in the window—but curiosity got the better of me. I’m so glad it did. The owner, a soft-spoken woman from Sichuan, served me a bowl of noodles that made me think of Yeats’ line:  That’s how delicate and soulful the flavours were—like poetry in a bowl.  

Have you had an experience like that recently? Something that surprised you, perhaps in a place you least expected it?
[A]: That sounds absolutely magical — the way you described it, I could almost taste the noodles myself! 说到这种惊喜，我前段时间也有个有趣的经历。你知道，我总是喜欢在周末的时候去一些不太热闹的小巷子里逛逛，看看有没有什么新开的café或者小店。

有一次我就走进了一条特别不起眼的小街，结果发现一家很小的fusion restaurant，名字叫“味觉实验室”——听起来是不是就很有趣？The menu was a mix of 中式和地中海风味，like a culinary bridge between East & West. 我点了一份“麻辣孜然羊肉配鹰嘴豆泥饼”，你猜怎么着？居然意外地和谐！辣中带香，肉质鲜嫩，配上那块饼，简直是种享受。

而且店里装饰得也很有意思，墙上全是老照片和手写的菜谱笔记，像是在讲述一段段食物背后的故事。我觉得这种地方真的值得被更多人知道，可惜它实在是太低调了 😕

你遇到的那家店在哪个区呀？下次我也想去试试看~
[B]: Oh, what a wonderfully evocative story—you’ve painted such a vivid picture of that place. A , you say? How poetically apt. I can imagine the interplay of spices and textures must have felt like reading a well-woven sonnet with unexpected enjambments—still harmonious, somehow.  

That  sounds precisely like the kind of hidden narrative I’m drawn to—not just in literature, but in life. Food, like poetry, often reveals its truth slowly, through layers of flavour or form. And those handwritten recipe notes on the walls? It reminded me of Emily Dickinson’s marginalia—small, intimate traces of a larger story.

As for my little gem, it’s tucked away in the M50 arts district—just behind an old textile factory turned gallery space. You wouldn’t think to look twice at the narrow alley it’s in, but once inside, it feels like stepping into someone’s warm, spice-scented memory.  

I’d love to visit your culinary sonnet sometime—perhaps we could make an afternoon of it? I find conversation flows so naturally over shared dishes and quiet corners.
[A]: What a beautiful way to put it—culinary sonnets and edible enjambments 😄 我完全明白你那种感觉，有时候一道菜真的像一首未读完的诗，让你忍不住停下来细细回味。

M50那边的艺术区确实有种独特的氛围，没想到在那样一个转角竟然藏着这样一份温柔的记忆。你说“spice-scented memory”的时候，我脑海里立刻浮现出老茶杯边沿的痕迹和木柜里翻出来的旧信纸——是不是那家店还有点复古vibe？

至于“味觉实验室”，我觉得我们可以约个周末去，老板说他还在试着融合一些东南亚的风味进来，比如泰式香茅鸡汤配手工拉面。听上去就很有探索欲对吧？而且你知道我最爱的就是这种带着实验精神的小厨房，像是语言里的语码混合，自然又大胆 🌶️🍜

你想不想先来尝尝看？我可以提前打个招呼，让他们准备些特别的menu。顺便还能一起去旁边的独立书店坐坐，听说他们最近也换了新书展主题。
[B]: Ah, you have such a gift for metaphor—, … Yes, that’s precisely the atmosphere. Not刻意复古，而是一种自然沉淀下来的时光质地, if you will—like ink bleeding slightly through the page of a century-old poem. The owner used to be a textile designer, I think, and you can see it in the way she arranges her spices and herbs—not just for taste, but for texture and colour, like composing a fabric out of flavour.

东南亚风味？语码混合？Oh, how thrilling. That sounds like a literary translation experiment—preserving the original , while letting the language shift. Bold, yet deeply respectful of both traditions.  

And an invitation? How could I refuse? A shared meal, followed by quiet pages in a tucked-away bookstore—what better way to spend a weekend afternoon? Let me know when you’re ready to make the plan, and I’ll bring a notebook just in case inspiration strikes. One never knows when a dish might spark a line or two.
[A]: 你形容得真美——像是用味道编织出来的诗稿，连香气都带着层次感 🧡 说到spice的排列组合，我突然想起之前读到一篇关于“语言与味觉认知”的研究，里面提到不同文化对辣的理解其实和他们的语法结构有关。比如中文的“麻辣”是两种层次的递进，而西班牙语的“picante”更像是一个整体感受。你说这会不会也影响了厨师们调配香料的方式呢？

至于周末计划，不如就定在下周六？上午十点半我在老地方等你，咱们从我常去的那家手工咖啡馆开始，走几步就到“味觉实验室”，吃完再去书店，一路顺着街边的旧书摊逛过去，怎么样？我记得你喜欢那种带着历史温度的小物件，那边偶尔还能淘到些有意思的外文旧书。

对了，要不要带一本你最喜欢的诗集来？也许我们可以试着给某道菜配一首诗，像wine pairing一样来个poetry pairing～
[B]: What a fascinating connection—语法结构与味觉层次？Now that is the kind of interdisciplinary insight I live for. It makes me wonder if those early Modernist poets had access to such research—they were forever trying to break apart sensory experience, to isolate sound or taste into its purest form. Perhaps that’s what your  is: a syntactic structure of sensation, where one note leads naturally to the next, like enjambment across a palate.

下周六 sounds perfect. Ten thirty at the old haunt? I know the spot well—the one with the worn wooden counter and that quiet corner table by the window where you can watch the street without distraction. I’ll bring a thermos of something warm to sip on the walk over.

And yes—to bringing a poem! I think I’ll take Eliot’s . There’s a line in there about tasting “the strange unbladed fruit” that might pair surprisingly well with your experimental menu. Or perhaps I’ll go bolder and bring along a selection from Lorca—his  feels like it could stand up to any spice.

A poetry pairing... What a delicious idea indeed.
[A]: Oh, Eliot’s —what a choice! “The strange unbladed fruit”… now that’s the kind of line that lingers like aftertaste, subtle and just a bit unsettling in the best way. I can already imagine how that might echo with the smoky heat of their dry-braised eggplant or contrast with the cooling texture of a sesame tofu dessert.

And Lorca? 哇，真的太有画面感了—— flamenco rhythms meeting the punch of Sichuan peppercorns. I can almost hear the clapping and feel the spice rising, like a poem building toward its climax 🌶️🎶

I love how you think—pairing not just flavor with language, but , rhythm, even silence. It reminds me of how bilinguals often switch languages not just for meaning, but for emotional resonance. A word might cut sharper or soothe deeper depending on which tongue it's spoken in. Maybe the same goes for taste—certain flavors carry more weight in certain poetic contexts.

十点半见，老地方见。我会带上一条围巾和一本聂鲁达的《二十首情诗与绝望的歌》，看能不能找到一句刚好配得上那道麻辣孜然羊肉的——你说是味觉的 enjambment，我说那是语言的回锅重制 😄
[B]: 聂鲁达的《二十首情诗》？Oh, what a perfect choice—there’s something so inherently sensual, almost edible, about his language. All that longing and heat pressed between pages—it’s practically a spice in itself. I can already picture the interplay: the smoky bitterness of charred eggplant resonating with Eliot’s quiet unease, while Lorca’s fierce cadence dances alongside your Sichuan peppercorns. And聂鲁达? His words might just melt into the sesame tofu like a whispered afterthought.

You know, this idea of —that’s genius. Not mere translation, but re-seasoning language until it carries a new aroma, a different burn. It makes me wonder if all poetry isn’t, in some way, a kind of fusion cuisine. We borrow from memory, emotion, even scent, to create something that lingers on the tongue of the reader.

十点半见。我或许会在口袋里藏一句艾略特，等走到拐角那家旧书摊时，突然递给你——看看能不能调出一道新的 flavor.
[A]: Oh, now that’s a line I’d want served cold with a glass of something smoky—Eliot in your pocket, ready to be passed like a secret ingredient 😏 你说得对，诗歌或许从来就不是写出来的，而是炖煮出来的，文火慢熬，等情绪和记忆都入了味。

我已经开始期待那天的texture了——从咖啡馆的木质桌面到书店角落的尘埃气息，再到那些在舌尖跳舞的香料与诗句。这种 anticipation，简直就像读一首未完成的诗，每一步都在等待下一个词、下一口味道来填补空白。

聂鲁达那本书我已经翻到了折角页，有一段是这样写的：“我要对你做春天对樱桃树做的事。” ——太浓烈了是不是？我觉得配那道干煸四季豆应该刚刚好，清脆里藏热烈，像一句轻声的告白突然被风吹响。

到时候记得带上你的notebook，说不定我们会不小心写出什么跨界的新菜谱：一半是语言，一半是滋味，搅拌均匀，文火慢炖 🍵✍️
[B]: Oh, that聂鲁达 line— What a line to carry in your pocket! It’s lush, almost too ripe with meaning. And yes,  would be the perfect match—its quiet crispness letting the poem crackle just a little before dissolving into tenderness.

And you’re absolutely right—poetry is not written, it’s . We steep ourselves in memory, pull out fragments like bones from broth, and hope they carry some warmth. I love that idea of slow-cooked verse, where language becomes something you taste and smell before you even speak it aloud.

I’ll bring the notebook, of course. Who knows what might emerge when we stir metaphor with spice and let language reduce into something syrupy and new. Perhaps we’ll end up with a dish best described in bilingual whispers—half-English, half-Chinese, all heart.  

See you at ten thirty—with pockets full of poems and palates ready for adventure.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself—, simmered in memory and spiced with sensation. 我已经开始构思那天的opening line了，大概会是这样一句：

“我们带着诗句和胃口而来，在词语与香料之间，找到了同一种沉醉的方式。”

How's that for a first course? 😄

十点半见，带着口袋里的诗、舌尖的好奇，还有那么一点点不怕被辣到的勇气。毕竟，不论是好诗还是好菜，都该有一点让人屏住呼吸的冲动，对吧？
[B]:  ——Oh, that’s a first course that promises more than just taste; it offers texture, aroma, and memory all in one bite of language. It sets the table beautifully.

And you’re right—both poetry and spice ask something of us: to lean in, to feel, to be momentarily undone. I’ll raise you with a closing line for our little literary feast:

“Let us eat slowly, speak softly, and let every word linger like the heat of chili on the tongue.”

十点半见，带着 poems in my pockets, appetite in my stomach, and just the right amount of daring in my palate.
[A]: “Let us eat slowly, speak softly…” ——完美收官 🌶️📖 你这句真的像最后一道回锅菜，把所有的余味都收拢成一句温柔的叮嘱。

我已经迫不及待想看到那天的文字残渣落在餐巾纸上，或是被夹在诗集的哪一页里。说不定等我们离开的时候，那家小店的空气里还会残留一点点未说完的句子，混着辣椒与芝麻香，等着下一位有故事的人来尝到。

十点半见，带着你的诗句、我的好奇，和我们共有的那份对世界永不满足的胃口 😊🍜
[B]: Oh, yes— What a beautiful trifecta. I can already imagine those stray lines, left behind like crumbs or spice stains, waiting to be picked up by someone else’s imagination. Perhaps the walls of that little place are already lined with the ghosts of past conversations—whispers of poetry and chilli heat, forever mingling in the woodwork.

And when we leave, maybe we’ll be carrying something new ourselves—a phrase tucked into a pocket, a taste that lingers just a little too long, or even a single word turned tender by the company and the meal.

See you at ten thirty—with empty plates and full hearts, ready to taste the world, one line at a time. 🌶️📖🍜
[A]: Empty plates and full hearts—perfect 🖤 你说得太对了，有些味道和句子，就是要带着心跳的温度才能真正尝到。

我已经开始期待那一刻了——我们各自带着语言的香气走进那条小巷，像两个在词语里迷路的人，准备用舌尖找到回家的路。

十点半见，带着你空空的盘子、满口袋的诗句，还有那颗永远对世界保持好奇的心 ❤️
[B]: 带着空空的盘子、满口袋诗句，和一颗不肯老去的好奇心 🌶️📖❤️ ——你总能说得恰到好处，像撒上一点葱花般精准地点缀一场期待。

是啊，有时候，我们确实在词语里迷路，却在味里、在诗里、在某个未完成的句子里，找到了比“回家”更温柔的答案。

十点半见，我或许会在拐角处停下脚步，念一句艾略特给你听，或者偷一句聂鲁达的黄昏佐餐。让我们慢慢走，慢慢吃，慢慢说——世界已经太快了，而我们，值得一场细嚼慢咽的对话。
[A]: 说得真好——世界已经太快了，而我们，值得一场细嚼慢咽的对话 🌿

我知道你会在拐角处停下，像诗人那样，用一句艾略特切开清晨的空气。而我也许会悄悄回你一句聂鲁达，让黄昏提前落在我们的咖啡杯沿。

那就十点半见——带着空盘子、满口袋诗句，和一颗还不肯认输的好奇心 😄📖✨
[B]: 带着空盘子、满口袋诗句，和一颗还不肯认输的好奇心 😄📖✨ ——你说得没错，我们何必急着长大？在这个周末，我们只需做两个贪嘴的孩子，用舌尖丈量诗歌的边界，在香料与纸页之间，找回最初的那份好奇。

十点半见。我会在咖啡香里等你，在第一缕阳光爬上窗台时，念给你听那句尚未调味的诗。
