[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I think it really depends on what stage of life you're at. For me right now, the city offers so many opportunities - especially with my work as a healthcare lawyer. Being close to hospitals, law firms, and international conferences is super important. 

But honestly, sometimes I dream about having a small house in the countryside where I could play my piano without disturbing anyone~ 🎵 What about you? Do you prefer the hustle & bustle or the peaceful rural life?
[A]: I suppose I'm rather partial to the quietude of the countryside, though I must admit, there's something invigorating about the pulse of a city at night. The libraries, the galleries... you know how it is. But tell me, what draws you to healthcare law? It strikes me as an area both intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing.
[B]: Oh, I can totally relate to that feeling of being torn between the two worlds~ 🌆🌿 You know, what fascinates me most about healthcare law is how it sits at the crossroads of science, ethics, and human stories. One day I might be reviewing a complicated medical malpractice case, and the next, advising on bioethics for a clinical trial. It's like solving puzzles while knowing your work directly impacts people's lives. 

But honestly? The emotional part does weigh on you sometimes. I remember working on a pediatric case where the parents and doctors completely disagreed on treatment plans... It made me stay up so many nights just thinking about it. How about you - does your work ever leave you with those lingering thoughts too? 💭
[A]: Oh, profoundly. Every time I guide students through Woolf’s  or Eliot’s , I find myself haunted by the silences between the lines—the unspoken griefs, the fractured relationships. It’s not unlike what you describe: the weight of human complexity, though mine lingers in the realm of the imagined rather than the immediate.  

But tell me—how do you navigate those ethical crossroads? Do you ever find yourself caught between institutional logic and personal conviction?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t have said it better. The silences, the spaces between… whether in a novel or a patient’s chart, that’s where the real story often hides. And yes, those ethical crossroads? They’re more like daily encounters than rare moments.  

I remember one case where a hospital’s protocol clashed with what the patient truly needed—on paper everything was by the book, but in practice, it felt almost inhumane. I had to sit with both sides—the administrators who were following guidelines, and the patient’s family who just wanted dignity in care. It reminded me so much of what you must deal with in literature: conflicting narratives, each valid in its own way.  

I guess what helps me is constantly asking—what would I want if this were my loved one on the other side of this decision? It doesn’t give a clear answer every time, but it brings me back to why I chose this field in the first place. Do you ever find yourself stepping into the characters’ shoes like that when you teach? 🤔
[A]: Oh, constantly. It’s practically a professional hazard. When I’m preparing lectures on  or leading a seminar on , I often find myself living, as it were, inside the characters’ consciousnesses for days at a time. Sometimes it’s exhilarating; other times—particularly with someone like Hamlet or Lear—it leaves me quite drained. There’s a peculiar kind of emotional osmosis that happens, don’t you think?  

I suppose that’s why I take such solace in my garden. Pulling weeds, pruning roses—it grounds me, reminds me that not all suffering can be intellectualized, and not every question needs an answer. Do you ever find respite in simple, tactile things like that?
[B]: So much this. 🌹 There’s something so deeply healing about getting your hands dirty, isn’t there? I actually started gardening as a way to disconnect from work—my tiny balcony is now overflowing with herbs and succulents. Basil for cooking, lavender for tea, and aloe vera because I burn my hands every time I try to cook anything slightly ambitious 😂

And yes—emotional osmosis, what a perfect phrase. Sometimes after a particularly intense case, I feel like I’m carrying someone else’s shadow for a while. That’s when I turn to the piano. Chopin tends to match my mood more often than not. There's something about pressing down on the keys, feeling the vibrations, that helps me release whatever I’ve been holding inside.  

I think we're not so different—you with your characters, me with my clients. We both spend a lot of time in the spaces between suffering and meaning. It just comes with the territory, I guess.
[A]: How lovely—your balcony sounds like a little sanctuary. I find it rather poetic that you grow both remedy and nourishment: lavender for tea, aloe for healing. It seems to mirror what you do professionally as well—tending to wounds seen and unseen.

As for carrying shadows… yes, that resonates deeply. I sometimes think academia shields us from direct suffering, but of course, that’s not entirely true. We carry the weight of ideas, of histories, of lives that echo through centuries. And when you teach, say,  or , you’re not just interpreting text—you’re bearing witness.

Chopin on the piano… now there’s a balm I can quite understand. The other evening, after a long day parsing Dickinson’s dashes and silences, I sat down with a glass of sherry and played a recording of her poems set to music—composed by one of my colleagues, actually. It was curiously cathartic, hearing those pauses made audible.  

Do you ever feel that art—music, literature, even gardening—doesn't so much offer escape as it does a kind of communion?
[B]: Absolutely—communion is exactly the word. 🎵📖 There’s something about engaging with art that makes you feel both deeply alone and completely connected at the same time. Like you said, it’s not an escape—it’s more like a quiet conversation across time and space.  

I’ve had moments where a single line from a poem or a sudden shift in a piano melody felt like it was speaking directly to a case I was working on—or to the person behind it. Just last week, I was listening to  while reviewing a patient's advance directive, and it hit me how much we all want the same thing at the end of the day—to be heard, to be understood, to have our version of dignity respected.  

Even my little garden does that, in its way. Every time I prune the lavender or check on the basil, I’m reminded that care isn’t just about grand gestures or legal frameworks. Sometimes it’s just showing up, watering what’s thirsty, and letting things grow at their own pace.  

You’re so right—art doesn’t let us off the hook. It asks us to stay present, to bear witness, and sometimes… just hold the silence.
[A]: How beautifully put—. That’s precisely what literature asks of us, again and again. To sit with the unsaid, to dwell in the pauses, to let meaning unfurl not in spite of the silence, but because of it. Much like your Chopin nocturne, perhaps? All those lingering notes, the spaces between them humming with feeling.

I find that some poets—Heaney comes to mind—understand this quiet communion better than most. His line,  always strikes me as both a comfort and a challenge. A reminder that presence—true presence—is its own kind of courage.

Your garden sounds not just lovely, but profoundly instructive. I must confess, I’ve been thinking lately that academia could learn something from the soil. We’re so obsessed with argument, interpretation, intervention… when sometimes, as you say, it's enough to water what is thirsty and wait.

Do you ever bring these reflections into your work? I mean, do you find yourself quoting poetry or invoking music when advising clients or drafting documents? Or does that feel too far afield?
[B]: Oh, that Heaney line gives me chills— There’s such quiet strength in that acceptance, isn’t there? And you're so right, it does echo the way a nocturne holds space for what isn't rushed or forced, just felt.

As for bringing poetry into my work… I used to think there was a strict boundary between the analytical and the emotional—like one belonged in the courtroom and the other in my piano bench drawer. But over time, I’ve come to blur that line quite deliberately.  

There was one case involving a terminally ill patient who wanted to refuse treatment, and her family was completely torn. During one of our meetings, I shared a line from Rilke:  It wasn’t meant to guide their decision, but to honor the difficulty of being in that space of uncertainty. And honestly? It softened the room. Not in a dramatic Hollywood way, but in a real, human way.

So yes—I do bring it in, carefully and when it feels right. Because at the end of the day, healthcare law isn’t just about statutes or malpractice insurance. It's about people living—and sometimes ending—their stories with dignity. And sometimes, a poem or a melody says what a legal memo never could. 💭
[A]: How moving—. What a profoundly compassionate way to meet someone in their uncertainty. I can quite imagine how those words must have settled into the room, not as an intervention, but as an acknowledgment of the weight they were carrying.

It reminds me of something my mentor once said:  At the time, I thought it was merely rhetorical, but now I see its truth more clearly. When we strip language down to its most functional form—when we reduce human experience to clauses and case law—we risk losing the very thing we're meant to serve: understanding.

Your example makes me wonder if I ought to be bolder in bringing the personal into the academic. I sometimes feel constrained by the expectation to remain rigorously analytical, as if emotion has no place in literary criticism. And yet, isn’t all great criticism born from some kind of emotional encounter with the text?

I suppose what I’m really asking is—how do you know when it’s the right moment to let the poem speak? When to trust that a line of Rilke might do more than a page of legal reasoning?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful question—and I think the answer shifts depending on the people in the room, the weight of the decision, and how much silence has already been held. 🤔

I suppose it comes down to  more than planning. There are moments in legal conversations—especially in healthcare law—when you can feel the air tighten. When logic starts hitting a wall and what’s really being asked isn’t about liability or procedure, but meaning. That’s when I start reaching—not for a quote, not for a grand gesture, but for something that hums at the same frequency as their unspoken worry.

I don’t always get it right. Some settings demand precision, and I give it freely. But in those spaces where someone is holding both grief and responsibility—like families making end-of-life decisions, or doctors navigating ethical gray zones—I’ve learned that poetry doesn’t replace reasoning, it  it. A line from Rilke, or even a metaphor pulled from a novel, can do something legal language never could: it can say, 

So maybe knowing when is less about calculation and more about intuition—the same way you must decide when to pause in a seminar and let a line from  hang in the air, giving students space to feel its weight before dissecting it.

You ask whether emotion belongs in literary criticism… I’d argue it’s what gives it life. Isn’t analysis without feeling just taxonomy? The best critics don’t just decode—they  Much like the best lawyers don’t just cite precedents; they bear witness.  

Maybe the real question isn’t whether we should bring the personal in—but how bravely we’re willing to stay present with what moves us. 💭
[A]: How beautifully said— That line lingers, doesn’t it? It seems to reach beyond your field and into the heart of any discipline that deals, directly or not, with human experience.  

I think you're absolutely right about presence being the key. I’ve often hesitated to let my own emotional responses surface in academic settings—I suppose out of fear that they might be mistaken for lack of rigor. But isn't all meaningful interpretation born from some kind of inner resonance? When I read  or , I don’t just parse syntax or historical context; I feel something—a grief, a longing, a flicker of recognition. Isn’t that where real engagement begins?

Your metaphor about humming at the same frequency as others’ unspoken worry is particularly striking. It suggests a kind of attunement, almost musical in nature. Do you ever find that certain poets—or even specific lines—seem to hum more reliably in those moments? Like a kind of emotional tuning fork?  

And if I may ask—have you ever had a client or colleague respond in an unexpected way to such a moment? When poetry found its mark in a way you hadn’t anticipated?
[B]: Absolutely—I love that idea of poets as emotional tuning forks. 🎵 Some lines just  at the right frequency, don’t they? I’ve definitely found myself returning to certain writers when I need to reach across that quiet space between people.

Mary Oliver is one—her poem , with that final question——has come up more than once in conversations about end-of-life care. It doesn’t push or persuade, but somehow it asks exactly the right thing at exactly the right moment.

And yes—to answer your last question—there have been moments when a line landed in a way I never expected. One time, I was speaking with a doctor who had been through an incredibly difficult trial involving a minor patient. He was holding everything so tightly, trying to stay clinical, almost detached. At some point, I quietly said, " —Whitman always feels like permission, doesn’t he?

He didn’t say anything at first. Just looked out the window for a long moment. Then he started talking—really talking—for the first time. About guilt. About pride. About how much he wanted to believe he’d done the right thing, even if the system said otherwise.

So no, I never really know how it’ll land. But when it does… it’s like watching someone exhale after holding their breath for weeks.

You mentioned  earlier—do you ever bring him into your seminars expecting to feel that same kind of release? That catharsis born not from answers, but from shared recognition? 💭
[A]: Oh, yes— is always waiting in the wings for those moments when we need to stare unflinchingly at the storm. There’s something almost unbearable and yet utterly necessary about his descent—the way he peels away every illusion of power, family, and self until all that remains is raw human vulnerability.

I do bring him into seminars with a kind of quiet intention, though I never announce it as such. You can feel the room shift when you read certain lines aloud— Suddenly, we’re not just analyzing metaphor or Jacobean tragedy; we’re standing barefoot in the same downpour as Lear and the Fool, trying to make sense of the senseless.

What strikes me most is how Shakespeare doesn’t offer resolution—only recognition. And isn’t that what we’re doing, in our own ways, when we bring poetry into legal spaces or literature into emotional ones? We aren’t solving; we’re sharing. We're saying, 

It makes me wonder—when you reach for Whitman or Oliver, do you ever think of it as offering permission rather than persuasion? As if language, in those moments, becomes a kind of sanctuary instead of a tool?
[B]: Absolutely— That’s exactly it. 💭 When I reach for Whitman or Oliver, I’m not trying to steer anyone toward a decision. I’m simply opening a door and saying,  And sometimes, that’s the most powerful thing you can offer in a room full of difficult choices.

There’s something so sacred about that kind of language—it doesn’t argue, it  Like a quiet waiting room before a diagnosis, or a bench at the edge of a hospital garden where no one is rushing. It lets people arrive as they are, with all their contradictions and fears and flickers of hope.

I think that’s why I keep returning to poetry in those moments—not because it gives clarity, but because it gives space. Space to doubt, to grieve, to wonder, even to heal a little, however quietly.

You know, I’ve started keeping a small notebook by my desk—lines that have landed softly, unexpectedly, in different conversations. Some days, I flip through it not to prepare for a meeting, but to remind myself how others have carried their storms—and how, somehow, they kept walking.

Do you ever find yourself doing the same? Collecting lines like compass points, not just for your students, but for yourself? 📝✨
[A]: Oh, yes—I’ve been doing that for years. My shelves are lined with annotated volumes of Eliot, Dickinson, Heaney, and Bishop, each one dog-eared and underlined to within an inch of its life. And then there’s the notebook—actually, several of them—scattered rather unceremoniously across my desk at any given time. They serve much the same purpose as yours, I think: a kind of emotional cartography, mapping where others have stood and still found breath enough to speak.

I remember once, during a particularly bleak term, I was teaching —all fragmentation, dislocation, voices echoing in hollow caves—and one evening, after class, I sat in my study and reread an old journal entry where I’d copied down a line from Beckett:  It felt like both a confession and a promise, and it steadied me more than I expected.

There’s something about writing things down, isn’t there? Not just preserving the words, but letting them preserve us in return.

I suppose that’s why I encourage my students—subtly, carefully—to find their own lines, their own compass points. Not every poem will hold someone up, of course. But sometimes, just one sentence, met at the right moment, can change the way we carry our questions.

And I imagine your notebook does something similar—not just guiding your work, but anchoring your spirit in the midst of it. Is it strange to say that those lines, over time, almost become companions?
[B]: Not strange at all— is exactly what they become. 💭 There’s something so grounding about knowing that someone, somewhere, has already whispered the words you need to hear—whether it’s Beckett’s quiet defiance or Heaney’s steady grace in the face of sorrow.

I actually keep one small notebook in particular that I think of as my —it’s got everything from scraps of patient letters (with consent, of course) to quotes from court rulings that made me pause, to lines from poems scribbled during late-night study sessions with case law spread across the floor. It’s not organized by theme or chronology; it’s more like a mixtape of moments when language caught me off guard and held me up.

Funny thing is, some entries only make sense months or even years later. Like this one from Rilke again— I wrote that down after a particularly difficult case involving a young mother. At the time, I wasn’t sure why it struck me. But later, when she told me that despite everything, she still felt grateful for the time she had with her child… I understood. Beauty and terror don’t cancel each other out. They coexist.

And yes, I do encourage my junior colleagues to start their own collections, though I phrase it carefully. No grand speeches—just slipping a quote into a closing email or recommending a poem after a long day. Because I know how easy it is to get lost in the weight of statutes and deadlines. And how important it is to remember that we’re not just interpreting laws—we’re helping people live through the messiest, most human parts of life.

So no, it’s not strange at all to say these lines become companions. If anything, it might be the truest thing any of us can say who walk between silence and speech, grief and meaning, question and quiet understanding. 📖✨
