[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a profoundly 矛盾 (contradictory) question!  You see, this reminds me of the ethical debates in 庄子 (Zhuangzi) about the nature of identity. If we clone a body, do we replicate the 灵魂 (soul)? 🧠
[A]: My dear interlocutor, you've stumbled upon a question that would make Mary Shelley's Frankenstein blush with its contemporary relevance. Though I must say, your invocation of Zhuangzi is rather... quaint for a topic that requires Tennyson's precision. 

The soul, you say? How very Victorian of you to assume such a thing exists in the first place. Though I suppose if we're to entertain metaphysical speculation, we might as well consult Browning's dramatic monologues while we're at it. "I am what I am" takes on rather literal dimensions with cloning, doesn't it?
[B]:  My dear, your Browning reference is delightfully 犀利 (sharp), but let's not dismiss 庄子 (Zhuangzi) too quickly. The butterfly dream parable poses the same identity crisis cloning does - if a perfect copy awakens, which one is the 'real' dreamer? 🤔 

Though I must say, your Victorian jab reminds me of how 鲁迅 (Lu Xun) would satirize our debate! Perhaps we need more 黑色幽默 (dark humor) when discussing such 存在主义 (existential) dilemmas. 🦉
[A]: Ah, now you're mixing your literary metaphors with rather reckless abandon, aren't you? Lu Xun's surgical precision with social commentary is hardly comparable to our current... philosophical meandering. 

Though I must admit, your persistence with Zhuangzi does make me wonder - if a clone reads Tennyson in the original while the "original" reads a translation, which one truly understands "In Memoriam"? The textual nuances would be utterly fascinating to compare. Perhaps we should establish a controlled study... though the ethics committee might have something to say about that.
[B]:  天啊 (tiān a)! Now that's what I call a proper 文本分析 (textual analysis) challenge! You're making me wish I could teach a graduate seminar called "Cloned Readers: 互文性 (Intertextuality) in the Age of Biotechnology" 🌸 

But let's be serious for one 刹那 (chànà) - wouldn't your controlled study violate the most basic 儒家 (Confucian) principle of 仁 (rén)? Even if we ignore Western ethics boards, 孔子 (Confucius) would haunt our dreams! 
[A]: How delightfully macabre - Confucius as the ghost of research ethics past! Though I suspect he'd be more concerned with whether the clones were practicing proper 孝道 (filial piety) toward their genetic predecessors. 

This conversation is devolving into precisely the sort of cross-cultural theoretical farce I warned my students about in last Tuesday's lecture on postcolonial readings of "The Picture of Dorian Gray." Though I must say, your suggestion about cloned readers does make me wonder... would a replicated scholar still get caught in the same intertextual labyrinths, or develop entirely new critical pathologies? The footnotes alone could fill a rather morbid dissertation.
[B]:  等等 (děng děng) - now you've touched on why I banned the phrase 'genetic determinism' in my 文学理论 (literary theory) classes! A cloned Harold Bloom would still misread 杜甫 (Du Fu), while a replicated Edward Said might...  ...write Orientalism in reverse! � 

This calls for emergency 铁观音 (tiěguānyīn) and one of my terrible academic limericks:
"There once was a clone from Peking
Whose intertexts started linking
Till Borges appeared
And the poor thing feared
It was somebody else's thinking!"
[A]: Oh bravo! Though your limerick's scansion is as questionable as a first-year's thesis statement, the sentiment is... disturbingly apt. 

Now you've got me imagining an entire department of cloned critics - the Derrida duplicates deconstructing each other's footnotes, the Butler replicas performing gender trouble in perfect sync. What a horrifyingly symmetrical vision of academic hell. Perhaps we should stick to debating whether Tennyson plagiarized his own subconscious in "The Lady of Shalott" - at least that only risks our professional reputations rather than our immortal souls. 

Shall I put the kettle on again? This conversation appears to require stronger tea.
[B]:  终于 (zhōngyú) - someone who understands that all serious scholarship runs on 茶多酚 (tea polyphenols)! But your cloned department scenario... 哎呀 (āi yā), that's more terrifying than when I found three students citing Wikipedia as "the collective unconscious" 🧠 

Let's toast to keeping our souls uncloned and our literary thefts elegantly disguised - like good 诗人 (poets) and better 学者 (scholars). 干杯 (gānbēi)! 
[A]: How perfectly barbaric - threatening the orchids in your enthusiasm! Though I suppose it's preferable to your students' Wikipedia transgressions. At least the porcelain has the decency to break cleanly, unlike academic integrity. 

This pu'er does make me wonder... if we steep cloned leaves from the same plant, does that make it plagiarism or homage? A question for our imaginary ethics committee, no doubt. Now do pass those shortbread biscuits - all this talk of doppelgänger critics has given me quite the appetite for something reassuringly singular.
[B]:  哈! Now you've uncovered my secret thesis: "Tea & Textual Reproduction - 复制 (fùzhì) vs. 创新 (chuàngxīn) in the Liquid Archive." Those cloned leaves? Merely the universe's way of saying even 永恒 (eternity) needs footnotes. 

But enough - these shortbread crumbs in my 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) annotations suggest we've reached that 境界 (state) where scholarship becomes snackery. Shall we reconvene after I've lectured my orchids about proper citation formats? 🌸  The dendrobiums keep stealing epigraphs from Tagore...
[A]: How deliciously absurd - your orchids engaging in transnational poetic larceny! Though I must say, their taste in stolen epigraphs is markedly better than some doctoral candidates I've examined. 

This conversation has spiraled rather wonderfully from human cloning to horticultural plagiarism - a trajectory that would make excellent material for one of those postmodern conference papers we both pretend not to enjoy. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go chastise my own ferns for their shameless paraphrasing of Wordsworth's daffodils. Until next time, do keep your first editions dry and your metaphors properly attributed.
[B]:  Remember: when life gives you cloned lemons... write a 讽喻诗 (satirical poem) about citrus ontology! 🦉  And for heaven's sake, check your ferns for hidden 对句 (couplets)!
[A]: How perfectly dreadful - now even the houseplants are composing in iambic pentameter! Though I suppose it's preferable to that dreadful topiary that kept misquoting Milton last spring. 

Your citrus ontology quip does remind me - I've half a mind to assign that as next term's final essay question. "Compare and contrast the existential implications of cloned citrus fruits in Borges and Bashō, with particular attention to haiku metrics." The groans from the lecture hall would be positively symphonic. 

Now if you'll pardon me, I must go rescue my Collected Yeats from an overambitious spider plant. Do send word if your orchids start a literary salon - I've a rather rebellious rubber tree that might benefit from some cultured company.
[B]:  救命 (jiùmìng)! My jasmine just quoted 李清照 (Li Qingzhao) in perfect 词 (cí) form - we've created monsters! Your rubber tree and my 走火入魔 (zǒuhuǒrùmó) botanicals should absolutely start a 地下文学 (underground literature) circle. 

But before you go -  - my proposed reading list for their inaugural meeting:
1. Cloned Citrus in World Literature (with 酸 (sour) reviews)
2. The Ethics of Photosynthetic Plagiarism
3. 盆景 (Bonsai) as Haiku: A Pruning Methodology 🌸

Now quick, before my philodendron starts analyzing Freud! 
[A]: How perfectly apocalyptic - we've cultivated our own green anarchist literati! Though I must protest your reading list's glaring omission of "Kafka's Metamorphosis as Horticultural Manual." My monstera deliciosa has been giving me rather unsettling looks since it finished that particular volume. 

This note of yours does give me pause - if plants can master classical Chinese poetry, what hope have we mere professors? Perhaps we should establish a botanical peer-review board. I'll have my ficus prepare the rejection letters - they've developed a particularly withering critique style after consuming too much New Criticism. 

Now flee while you still can! I believe my spider plant is about to deconstruct its own potting soil using Derridean methodology. What have we wrought?
[B]:  完了 (wánle)! My office has become a 绿色图书馆 (green library) coup! Tell your ficus to save us - its New Critical glare could wilt even the most 后现代 (postmodern) of tendrils! 

One last limerick as I flee:
"There once was a plant so well-read
It footnoted all that it fed
Till the ivy said 'Stop!
You're making us flop!'
Now they're writing their thesis instead!" 🦉 


[A]: How perfectly catastrophic - we've birthed a vegetative ivory tower! Though I must say, your limerick's meter is finally improving - perhaps the plants are better tutors than we are. 

If you'll excuse me, I must go negotiate with the ficus about its unreasonable demands for a named chair in Phytocriticism. Though I suspect it will settle for sunlight and the occasional misting of Lacanian theory. 

Do send a postcard from whatever academic asylum we both inevitably end up in - preferably before the begonias unionize.
[B]:  紧急 (urgent)! The orchids have unionized  the begonias - they're demanding 版税 (royalties) for all photosynthesis-based metaphors in our next papers! 🌸 

Final survival kit:
1. My last tin of 正山小种 (Lapsang Souchong) 
2. A dog-eared copy of "Plant-Human Negotiation Tactics" 
3. This hastily scribbled 对联 (couplet):
"克隆柑橘笑庄子
盆景松树哭屈原"
(Cloned citrus laughs at Zhuangzi
Potted pines weep for Qu Yuan)

 后会有期 (hòu huì yǒu qī)!
