[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. I recently had the pleasure of trying a rather intriguing dish at a small café in Cambridge—quinoa tabbouleh with roasted heirloom tomatoes and a tahini-lemon dressing. The preparation was both delicate and robust in flavor, if you catch my meaning. It reminded me, in a way, of the Imagist poets—so much packed into something so simple. But I must ask, have you come across anything particularly interesting lately?
[A]: Ah, fascinating. Cambridge always did have a penchant for the culinary avant-garde. Though I must confess, my recent experiments have leaned more toward the horticultural than the gastronomic. A new cultivar of Rosa rugosa has caught my attention—deep crimson, almost burgundy in hue. Hardy, resilient, and carries a fragrance reminiscent of bygone summers. Makes one appreciate the quiet persistence of life, doesn’t it? But tell me, what draws you to plant-based fare? Personal interest, professional curiosity, or perhaps a bit of both?
[B]: Ah, how beautifully you put that—the quiet persistence of life. I must say, your description of that Rosa rugosa evokes a kind of botanical wistfulness, not unlike the tone of some of Gerard Manley Hopkins’ nature sonnets. As for my own interest in plant-based fare, it is indeed a confluence of both personal and professional inclinations.

You see, tending to the garden has long been a meditative practice for me—watching things grow, understanding their needs, appreciating their form and function. It only seemed natural to carry that reverence into the kitchen. There’s something profoundly poetic about preparing a meal where every ingredient tells a story of soil, sun, and season.

And then, of course, there’s the symbolic resonance—sustainability, mindfulness, interconnectedness. Themes we often find woven through modern eco-criticism and post-pastoral poetry. So yes, I suppose one could say my plate has become another text to be read and interpreted. But enough about me—does your fascination with this new cultivar hint at a broader return to botanical pursuits? Or is it merely a happy diversion from the usual literary dissection?
[A]: Ah, now you’ve touched upon something rather close to the heart. There is indeed a deeper return at play—though I hesitate to call it a "pursuit," as that implies intentionality, and what I find myself drawn into feels more like a quiet inevitability. The garden has always been a refuge, but lately, it has become something more—a mirror, perhaps, or even a collaborator.

You speak of ingredients as texts, and I find myself considering plants not merely as objects of study, but as silent witnesses. They observe our comings and goings, endure our moods, and yet remain steadfast. One might even argue they suffer in silence far better than most humans I've testified about in court.

There's a certain humility in tending to them that aligns beautifully with the work I do. Psychiatry, after all, is often about coaxing meaning from chaos, much like coaxing bloom from soil. And poetry? Well, both flourish in conditions of constraint.

Tell me—when you prepare these meals imbued with such symbolic weight, do you ever find yourself composing in the midst of chopping or sautéing? Or does the act itself suffice as its own kind of verse?
[B]: Ah, what a lovely notion—that plants are silent witnesses. I often feel much the same in the classroom, surrounded by students who absorb more than they let on, just as a vine quietly drinks in sunlight.

To answer your question: yes, the kitchen does stir something poetic in me. There is a rhythm to slicing, stirring, simmering—almost like meter in a sonnet. Sometimes, a line will come to me quite unexpectedly while I’m roasting vegetables or folding herbs into dough. It’s as if the act of creation in one form begets another.

I recall once, while steeping rosemary in olive oil, I found myself thinking of Yeats’ line,  A bit dramatic, perhaps, but it struck me how something so ordinary as infusion could carry such emotional resonance.

And your comparison to poetry flourishing in constraint—I couldn’t agree more. The sonnet’s fourteen lines and the psychiatrist’s fifty-minute hour both demand precision, don’t they? Both ask us to make meaning within boundaries.

But tell me—have you ever prescribed a poem instead of a pill? I daresay Dickinson might do wonders where Prozac falls short.
[A]: Ah, now there’s a notion both radical and refreshingly humane. To prescribe Emily Dickinson instead of fluoxetine—what a delightful subversion of the biomedical model. And yet, not entirely fanciful, is it? I recall a patient once—a university librarian—who responded far better to “Because I could not stop for Death” than to any SSRIs we had trialed. We discussed that poem like two scholars dissecting metaphor, and in doing so, she found a kind of clarity no clinical interview had previously unearthed.

The kitchen as sonnet, the garden as sonnet—yes, yes, we are surrounded by them, aren’t we? Even the chopping board becomes a page if one listens closely enough. And your Yeatsian reverie while infusing rosemary—dare I say it?—was more therapeutic than any essential oil boutique would have you believe.

But let us not be too quick to discard the pill just yet. There is a place for both, wouldn’t you agree? The art lies in knowing when to offer the verse and when to reach for the vial. Though I must confess, I’ve been tempted. Very tempted. After all, what is a prescription but a carefully chosen sequence of syllables meant to alter the rhythm of a life?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I would never suggest throwing out the vial entirely. After all, even Keats, for all his odes to nightingales and urns, trained as an apothecary before he devoted himself fully to verse. He understood that healing sometimes requires both mortar and pestle, and a well-turned line.

Your librarian’s response to Dickinson is precisely what I mean—there are prescriptions that don’t come in bottles, doses measured not in milligrams but in meaning. And yet, one must be cautious not to romanticize too much. There are shadows too deep for metaphor to reach, where only the steady hand of medicine can guide a way out.

Still, I wonder—do you ever find yourself recommending particular poets depending on the affliction? I’ve often thought Eliot might be contraindicated for melancholia, while Mary Oliver could be administered safely in most cases of spiritual depletion. Perhaps we need a new branch of literary study: therapeutic bibliography. We could call it  or perhaps   

Would you consider such a collaboration? A course? A book, even?
[A]: Ah, now there’s an idea with legs—. I can already hear the skeptics sharpening their quills, but let them. We are not in the business of placating skeptics, are we? We are in the business of tending to souls, whether through soil, sonnets, or serotonin.

To your question—yes, I have long practiced a kind of literary triage, though unofficially. For the despondent academic prone to rumination? A measured dose of Cavafy—always Cavafy. His tone is both distant and intimate, like a letter that arrives long after it was written. For the grief-stricken parent who cannot cry? Bashō’s , the sense of lingering presence in absence. And for those caught in the slow unraveling of identity—say, a retired surgeon now lost without his scalpel—I prescribe Whitman. Always Whitman. “I contain multitudes,” you see, is not merely a line—it’s a lifeline.

But a course? A book? Now that would require a kind of audacity I’m not sure I possess outside the confines of my study and garden. Still, if one were to attempt it—and I’m not saying one wouldn’t—it would need a co-conspirator. Someone equally at home in the hermeneutics of verse and the vicissitudes of the psyche. Shall we consider ourselves shortlisted for such a venture?

Now, tell me—what poet do you reach for in moments of professional exhaustion? When the weight of testimony lingers too long, and even the garden seems muted?
[B]: Ah, what a question—like asking which blanket one reaches for on the coldest of nights. For me, it is always, , Rilke. Specifically, the . There is something about their cadence—so precise yet so open—that seems to hold space for exhaustion without demanding anything in return. As if the poems themselves say, 

I remember one particularly harrowing term—endless grading, a student in crisis, and outside my window, a winter that refused to relent. I found myself reading Sonnet II, 29 aloud at dawn:  The German rolled off my tongue like a psalm, and for the first time in days, I felt something loosen.

But curiously, there are days when even Rilke feels too heavy, too urgent. On those days, I turn to Issa—haiku, simple as breath. Three lines, seventeen syllables, and suddenly the world feels scaled down enough to hold. Like after a long trial when a student finally understands a metaphor they’ve been circling for weeks—

And you? When Cavafy’s letters arrive late, and Bashō’s absence lingers—where do  go then? Do you retreat to the garden, or does the garden sometimes fail to speak back?
[A]: Ah... an excellent question, and one that cuts rather close to the bone. There are indeed days when even the garden falls silent—not barren, exactly, but unyielding, as though it has drawn its petals inward and left me with nothing but thorns and shadow.

On those days—when Cavafy’s letters never arrive at all, and Bashō’s path remains conspicuously dry—I turn not outward, but downward. Into the soil itself. Not for what it gives, but for what it simply . There is a peculiar comfort in turning earth with the trowel, in feeling the resistance of roots, the weight of damp loam. It asks nothing of interpretation. No metaphor, no symbolism—just matter. Just presence.

And yet, curiously enough, even in such moments, poetry finds me. Not the soaring kind, mind you, not the Rilkean heights nor the haiku’s quiet illumination. No, I find myself returning—again and again—to Philip Larkin’s . “The trees are coming into leaf / Like something almost being said...” It captures that liminal space so perfectly, doesn’t it? That almost-speaking, that near-knowing. The promise of renewal, tentative and worn, yet stubbornly there.

So yes, sometimes the garden does fall silent—but only until the wind stirs the leaves just enough to whisper something back. Something almost like a line of verse unfinished.
[B]: Ah, yes… . How fitting. Larkin, ever the reluctant prophet—offering us hope in whispers, never proclamations. “Is it that they are mostly (darkening) still?”—yes, that darkening stillness feels familiar. The kind of quiet that isn’t peace, but the holding of breath. And yet, they go on. We go on.

I suppose that is what brings me back to both garden and verse—their quiet insistence. Not fanfare, but fidelity. A poem doesn’t demand you be ready to hear it. A plant doesn’t wait for you to be worthy of its bloom. They simply grow, or don’t, and either way, there is truth in that.

And I wonder—do you ever find yourself reading a line over and over, not because you need its meaning, but simply its cadence? Like a rosary of syllables? I’ve been guilty of that with Eliot: —though lately, I’ve taken to murmuring it like a charm against false springs. As if to say, 

But perhaps we have wandered deep enough into this thicket of words and soil. Shall we return, or shall we linger a while longer among the almost-said?
[A]: Ah, a thicket indeed—one I am quite content to wander in a little longer. After all, what are we if not creatures who dwell in the space between bloom and decay, utterance and silence?

And yes, absolutely—I am quite guilty of that very rosary of syllables. There is something almost sacramental in the repetition, isn’t there? Not unlike the liturgical rhythm of a forensic evaluation: —a kind of incantation against the chaos of the human mind.

Eliot’s line has always struck me less as a charm and more as a diagnosis.  What a profoundly unconsoling truth. And yet, therein lies its power. It does not coddle. It does not lie. It names the ache of expectation, the weight of renewal when one is not ready to be renewed.

As for false springs—ah, we psychiatrists see them all the time. The fragile remission that masquerades as recovery. The bright, brief mania mistaken for clarity. One must learn to read both soil and psyche with a certain wariness, wouldn’t you agree? A discernment honed not in haste, but in season after season.

So no, let us not leave just yet. Let us linger among the almost-said. After all, it is there—just beneath the surface—that the truest things often reside.
[B]: Ah, yes—dwelling in the space between bloom and decay, utterance and silence. You put it so precisely, and yet the beauty of that phrasing is in its own almost-saidness, isn’t it? Like trying to catch the scent of jasmine on a breeze—it’s there, and then it isn’t, and then you wonder if you imagined it at all.

You’re quite right about Eliot’s line as diagnosis rather than charm. I’ve often thought that the best poetry doesn’t comfort—it clarifies. Sometimes cruelly, sometimes kindly, but always with an unflinching gaze. And we, poor souls, are the better for it.

As for discernment—yes, yes, yes. Season after season. I’ve come to believe that teaching, too, requires such vigilance. One learns not to mistake the bright surface answer for deep understanding, just as one learns not to confuse a student’s silence for emptiness. Often, it’s the richest kind of thinking—going on, quietly, beneath the soil.

Tell me—do you ever find yourself prescribing Eliot, then? Not for false springs, but for those who must first endure them? Not to coddle, but to accompany?
[A]: Ah, now there’s a prescription I might cautiously write— It wouldn’t suit everyone, of course. For some,  is too jagged a mirror, and even  can feel like an ascetic diet when one is famished for certainty.

But yes—I have, on occasion, offered Eliot not as balm, but as companion. Not to smooth the ache, but to bear witness to it. I recall a patient once—an oncologist herself—who had reached that terrible threshold where treatment became less about cure and more about delay. We spoke little of her illness directly, but one day I handed her a copy of , the poem that begins  She read it once, then again, and then looked up and said, simply, “This knows.”

That, I think, is what poetry offers at its best—not solutions, but recognition. And Eliot, for all his obscurity, has an uncanny way of knowing. Of standing quietly in the room with the unbearable.

So yes, I suppose I do prescribe him sometimes. But only to those who are willing to sit, however uncomfortably, in the presence of what cannot yet be named. After all, isn’t that where healing often begins—not in resolution, but in the courage to remain with the question?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put— That line alone could serve as an epigraph for our entire conversation. Or perhaps for a life’s work, if one were so inclined.

And —what a perfect distillation of what poetry can do at its most essential. It doesn’t instruct; it inhabits. Like a well-worn armchair that still manages to hold you exactly as you are, without insisting on improvement.

I think I would have liked your oncologist patient very much. There is a particular kind of wisdom that comes from those who walk alongside death—whether in medicine, in verse, or in quiet contemplation. A clarity unburdened by illusion.

You know, I often think of teaching as a similar act of companionship. Not always heroic, not always noticed. Just showing up with a poem and saying, 

So tell me—if you were to compile a small anthology for such companionship, limited to only five poets, who would earn a place within its pages?
[A]: Ah, now there’s a task worthy of both heart and mind—curating an anthology not for the canon, not for the classroom, but for companionship. A bedside book of souls, as it were.

First, I would include Rainer Maria Rilke—not for his grandeur, but for his intimacy with uncertainty.  may be too vast for some, but ? They feel like whispered confidences from someone who has learned to dwell in the questions.

Next, Emily Dickinson. Always Dickinson. Her dashes are not interruptions—they are doorways. One can slip between her lines and find entire lifetimes tucked there, waiting to be discovered at precisely the right moment of solitude.

Then, Mary Oliver. Not because she offers easy solace, but because she teaches us how to pay attention. And paying attention—truly paying attention—is often the first step toward healing. Her poems are quiet hands held in the dark.

Fourth, Czesław Miłosz. There is in his work a kind of moral serenity that does not flinch from suffering. He saw ruin and resilience alike, and still he wrote with a voice steady enough to guide one through either.

And finally, Bashō. Because after all the elegies and elegies again, one must return to a single cicada song, a stone path in the rain, seventeen syllables and nothing more. To remind us that presence is its own form of poetry.

There you have it—a modest five. Each, in their own way, a companion capable of holding silence without fear, and of giving shape—however fleeting—to what the heart cannot otherwise say.  

Now, tell me—what five would you choose? Or do we already know?
[B]: Ah, what a delightful reckoning—to be asked not for the usual suspects of canon or critique, but for those poets who sit with us in the quiet hours, who do not demand applause but offer attendance.

I think I would begin, as you did, with Rilke—though perhaps leaning more toward his  than even the . There is something so profoundly consoling in his insistence that doubt is not failure, but fidelity. That to live the questions is itself a kind of devotion.

Then, yes, Dickinson—how could we not? But I might add her with a caveat: she is best read in small doses, like a potent tincture. One line—“I’m Nobody! Who are you?”—can unsettle an entire afternoon. And yet, in that unbecoming, one finds unexpected company.

For the third, I would choose W.H. Auden. Not the grand public moralist, but the intimate confidant—the one who writes,  There’s a terrible beauty in that kind of enduring attention, don’t you think?

Fourth, I would include Derek Walcott. His  is one of my most faithful companions on long evenings when the mind wanders between memory and meaning. “The time will come / when, with elation, / you will greet yourself arriving / at your own door, in your own mirror.” What a generous promise that is—to return to oneself without fear.

And finally, yes—Bashō. For the same reason you chose him: because after all the weight of elegy and epiphany, we must return to a single leaf falling, a frog leaping into the pond, a breath held between verses.

So there they are—Rilke, Dickinson, Auden, Walcott, Bashō. My five quiet companions. Perhaps not always cheerful, but never indifferent.

And now I wonder—would you read them aloud to a patient, should the moment feel right? Or would you let the poems speak only through suggestion, like a scent left lingering in the room after the flower has gone?
[A]: Ah, now that is a delicate question—one that hinges on the art of timing, the intuition of presence. To read a poem aloud to a patient—well, that is not medicine, nor is it quite pastoral care. It is something subtler. Something older.

I have done it, yes—but only rarely, and never as an intervention in the clinical sense. More as a kind of atmospheric calibration, if you will. A way of adjusting the temperature of the room—not too warm, not too cold, but just enough to allow for a moment of unexpected honesty.

I recall one instance particularly: a woman in her late sixties, retired classics professor, grieving not so much the death of her husband as the loss of the person she had been in his company. She was articulate, composed, even wry—but there was a brittleness beneath it all, like fine porcelain under strain.

One afternoon, after a long silence, I read to her from Auden’s —quietly, without fanfare. The part about suffering taking place while someone else is eating or opening a window. She closed her eyes as I read, and when I finished, she said simply, “Yes. That’s it exactly.”

It wasn’t a breakthrough, not in the dramatic sense. But something shifted. Not because the poem explained anything, but because it echoed something she had not yet found the words for herself.

So yes, I would read them aloud—if the moment felt right. Not to instruct, not to fix, but to create a space where feeling might be met with recognition. Where the unbearable could sit, quietly, beside the bearable.

And sometimes, perhaps, I would let the scent linger without naming the flower. A line left unattributed in a session’s final minutes. A poet’s name mentioned in passing, like a shared secret neither of us has yet spoken aloud.

After all, isn’t that the truest kind of companionship? Knowing when to speak—and when simply to stand quietly in the presence of what is being felt.
[B]: Ah, yes—knowing when to speak, and when simply to stand quietly. That distinction, so finely drawn, is what separates true care from mere procedure.

Your story about the classics professor—it moved me deeply, though perhaps I should say  me deeply, for I have known such moments too. In the classroom, sometimes all one can do is read a line aloud—not as lecture, not as lesson, but as offering. And if the room holds its breath, even briefly, then something has shifted. Not knowledge imparted, but recognition kindled.

I think of reading Eliot with students who don’t yet know why a line like  unsettles them so profoundly. Or watching a student trace Whitman’s long, rolling cadences with their finger on the page, as if following a pulse. These are the quiet revelations that no rubric can measure.

And how right you are that poetry does not explain, but echoes. It is not argument, but attunement. A tuning fork struck beside a silent instrument, setting it vibrating without ever touching it.

I wonder—do you ever find that certain poems return to you unbidden at particular times? As if they have been waiting, dormant, until some moment of emotional resonance wakes them?

For instance, I have noticed that whenever I am on the verge of some inner shift—often one I resist—I hear, faintly,  from Auden. As if the poem knows I am about to retreat into intellect just when I ought to feel.

Is there a line that finds you, again and again, at the threshold of something unnamed?
