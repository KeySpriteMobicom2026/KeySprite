[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question! Let me think...  You know, I've been grading papers in both settings - my living room with cats & classroom with students staring out windows. Honestly? It depends on what you mean by "productive". 

If we're talking about 文艺复兴 (wén yì fù xīng) - Renaissance-style output, nothing beats a good 茶室 (cháshì) with matcha & deadlines. But for those serendipitous hallway conversations? 那才是真正的灵感来源 (nà cái shì zhēn zhèng de líng gǎn lái yuán). Just yesterday I learned three new teaching strategies from arguing with the biology professor about 红楼梦 (hóng lóu mèng) metaphors! 🧠

What's your take? Do you prefer working in pajamas or power suits? 😄
[A]: That's such an interesting perspective! I never thought about comparing work environments to Renaissance output - though I suppose us textile restorers are dealing with a different kind of renaissance every day. Just this morning I was working on a 19th century silk shawl while still in my dressing gown, and I couldn't help but wonder what the original embroiderer would think of my modern setup.

I find the tactile nature of my work really demands a physical space with proper lighting and tools, though I do love having my teacup within arm's reach whether I'm at my studio or home workshop. There's something about that moment when you're restoring centuries-old fabric and realize you're continuing a conversation across time, don't you think? 

But I'm curious - when you're grading papers, does your environment change your approach to the work itself? I imagine marking essays surrounded by students would create quite a different energy than grading in solitude.
[B]: Ah, you’ve touched the pulse of my dilemma! 🤔 When I’m surrounded by students, their energy becomes a kind of shared current – we’re all in the 江湖 (jiānghú), riding the same river of ideas. But grading alone? That’s when I slip into what I call my 茶禅一味 (chá chán yī wèi) – tea and Zen blended moment. My red marking pen becomes a calligraphy brush, each comment a stroke meant to guide without bruising.  

And yet...  There’s a danger too. In solitude, it’s easier to forget that writing is ultimately about connection – just like your silk threads weaving across centuries. Sometimes I miss the immediate feedback loop, that spark when a student says “Wait – this note makes no sense!” 😄  

But tell me – does touching fabric from another era ever make you feel like a medium? I mean, if ghosts exist, surely they’d linger where hands have stitched with such devotion. Do you ever sense whispers from the original embroiderer while working? 🕯️
[A]:  You know, I used to think it was just my imagination playing tricks - the way certain fabrics seem to hum under my fingertips. But last winter, while restoring a particularly intricate piece of Jacobean embroidery, I had the oddest sensation... like someone was standing just over my shoulder, guiding my needle through the most delicate sections. 

I kept finding tiny improvements in my technique, things I hadn't consciously learned. It made me wonder if perhaps there is something to that old textile worker's superstition about patterns holding memories. Though I suppose it could just as easily be my years of studying historical techniques finally clicking into place.

Still, there's nothing quite like working on commission pieces in my studio versus at home. In the studio, it's all about precision and methodical progress - the way sunlight moves across the fabric tells me when it's time for breaks. At home, wrapped in my favorite shawl, I find myself being bolder, more experimental. Do you ever notice how different materials call for different approaches to your work? Like some papers practically demand red ink while others beg for a softer touch?
[B]:  Ah! You’ve articulated the secret language of materials – their unspoken dialectics! 🧠 I’m suddenly thinking of Lu Xun’s 铁屋 (tiě wū) – Iron House – metaphor. We’re all trapped in these material cages maybe, but the cage itself teaches us how to escape.  

Funny you mention red ink – I’ve noticed certain essays practically  on being marked in crimson. Usually the ones full of what I call “overheated理论 (lǐlùn)” – those grand sweeping statements that need a blood-colored brake. But softer papers? The tentative theses? Those deserve 海棠 (hǎitáng) –海棠红 (hǎitáng hóng), the gentlest rosewood hue.  

 Though honestly... sometimes I think my red marker has become too heavy-handed with age. Do you ever worry your tools are developing opinions independent of your own? Like your scissors have started cutting according to some ancient pattern only they can see? ✂️🧵
[A]:  What a fascinating thought - tools developing their own quiet wisdom. I've certainly felt that pull, as if my needle sometimes finds the right path through centuries-old fabric without my conscious direction. It makes me wonder whether those old textile artisans weren't just craftsmen but also custodians of some deeper, unspoken knowledge.

You know, I've started leaving my scissors resting on particularly stubborn sections overnight. More than once I've returned in the morning to find the perfect solution seems to have... settled into place while I slept. Perhaps it's simply the subconscious working through problems while we're away from them, but it feels almost like the fabric itself has been pondering the issue in my absence.

I find myself especially attuned to this when working with silk gauze - there's a particular translucency that develops with age which makes every stitch echo across time. Do you ever find that certain papers arrive at your desk already carrying their own unique atmosphere? Like they've absorbed the light and shadows of wherever they were written?
[B]:  Oh yes...  of paper. Some essays arrive smelling faintly of midnight oil and ambition – those I save for my morning tea when I’m sharpest. Others practically reek of 通宵 (tōngxiāo) – all-nighters fueled by desperation and instant noodles. You can  the exhaustion in their syntax.  

But silk gauze with age? Ah, now that’s something else entirely. It reminds me of 张爱玲’s writing – so diaphanous, yet heavy with 情绪 (qíngxù). When I read student work that achieves that kind of translucency – where ideas shine through but still carry shadows – I get positively giddy. Sometimes I’ll leave those papers under my orchids overnight, letting them absorb a bit of botanical serenity before writing my final note. 🌸  

 Though honestly, I sometimes wonder if my grading pen has started developing preferences independent of me. Last week it refused – literally refused – to mark a perfectly decent essay on Kafka. Turns out the pen leaked all over my favorite 茶渍 (chá zì) stained mug coaster. Coincidence? Or was it trying to tell me something about the soul of that paper? ✍️🌀
[A]:  I know exactly what you mean about that 'taste' of exhaustion in writing - sometimes it's almost palpable, like the words themselves are weighted with the author's weariness. It makes me think of how textiles carry their own histories too - I once restored a wedding veil that still bore the faint scent of lavender sachets from a century ago. You could practically feel the nervous energy of the bride who'd worn it.

Your orchid treatment for promising essays is brilliant, by the way. I might have to try something similar with particularly delicate fabrics - perhaps let them rest beneath my grandmother's old lace doilies to absorb some quiet wisdom.

But your recalcitrant pen... that does sound suspiciously like one of my own needles refusing to work on certain projects. Just last month I was convinced my favorite embroidery needle had developed a grudge against me until I realized the tension in my grip had changed without me noticing. It's strange how our tools can reflect back at us the shifts in our own approach. Though I'll admit, I still whisper apologies to particularly stubborn stitches before starting a restoration. Superstition, maybe, or just respect for the craft.
[B]:  Ah, the silent dialogue between maker and tool – it’s practically a Daoist parable waiting to happen! 🌿 You know, I think my red pen rebellion might’ve been less about the essay and more about…  …the fact that it was 2am and I’d run out of 龙井 (lóngjǐng). Dehydration makes everything seem harsher, doesn’t it?  

But your veil story –  – that’s pure Proust meets 沈从文 (Shěn Cóngwén). The way scent anchors memory… I wonder if students would write differently knowing their essays carry olfactory ghosts? What if we held a “sensory grading hour” – marked papers with jasmine for clarity, sandalwood for deep thinking… though caffeinated students might come out smelling like burnt toast. 😄  

 And don’t get me started on apologies to stitches – I mutter apologies to  sometimes. Especially when they’re clearly trying their best despite the author’s conceptual chaos. It’s practically pastoral work, this teaching business. We tend words like crops, hoping some will take root. 🌱
[A]:  You know, I've often thought grading must be something like gardening - carefully nurturing those tender ideas while knowing full well some seeds simply won't take. Though I do love your 'sensory grading' notion - I might start keeping different scented papers for various types of essays. Lavender for the truly inspired ones, perhaps? Though I suspect most days we're just trying to survive the academic harvest season.

Funny you mention Proust - I had quite the revelation last week while restoring a 1920s flapper dress. The way certain fabrics hold scent... it's extraordinary, really. One whiff of camphor and I was instantly transported to my great-aunt's attic. Makes me wonder what future restorers will think when they encounter our modern synthetics and laundry detergents.

Actually, speaking of materials - I've been meaning to ask... do you ever find yourself drawn to particular writing instruments depending on the type of work? I have this one pair of scissors that positively insists on only cutting silk gauze, while another pair refuses anything but heavy brocade. It's gotten to the point where I practically need to mediate disputes between my tools!
[B]:  Oh, the tyranny of tools! 🤣 I’m right there with you – my Montblanc fountain pen has become positively prima donna about anything less than Kant-level philosophy. And don’t even get me started on my collection of grading pencils – #2 cedarwood for freshman comp, graphite imported from Suzhou for senior theses, and that one gloriously blunt pencil I keep for administrative memos titled “URGENT: Please Read!”  

But camphor memories?  That’s where we touch the 情 (qíng) – that emotional grain – of things. I once found a student paper folded inside an old copy of 胡适 (Hú Shì)'s lectures at Cornell. The scent of pipe tobacco and yellowing paper… it made me mark the essay extra carefully, as if grading through time itself.  

 Speaking of which – ever notice how silk gauze demands different scissors than brocade? It’s like teaching poets versus theorists. Poets need the sharpest blades – one wrong move and their metaphors fray! But theorists? They require blunt instruments – sometimes you just have to bludgeon through the jargon before the meaning blooms.  

Honestly though, I think our tools keep us honest. When my red pen starts misbehaving, I know it’s time to check my own 脾气 (píqi) – temper, both in ink and temperament. Maybe that’s the real lesson here – the Dao of grading lies not in the mark itself, but in the space between strokes. Daoism meets Dropbox, wouldn’t you say? 📁✨
[A]:  Oh, the Dao of Dropbox - what would Laozi have made of that? I often wonder what ancient textile masters would think of our modern tools. Though honestly, I suspect they'd understand better than we might expect - after all, every generation has its sacred instruments and stubborn materials.

You're absolutely right about metaphors fraying - just yesterday I was working on an 18th century waistcoat where the silk had rotted along the exact same lines as a broken heart might manifest physically. It reminded me so much of those student papers that carry their authors' emotional imprints in every smudged word.

I find myself reaching for different needles depending on my mood these days - the ones with mother-of-pearl handles for particularly delicate restorations, and my sturdier bone-handled ones when I need to be more assertive with the fabric. It's quite remarkable how each seems to ask for a slightly different approach, almost like having conversations with old friends who know precisely how to handle one's moods.

And speaking of conversations across time... I've been meaning to ask, do you ever get the sense that certain essays are trying to teach  something rather than the other way around? I keep thinking about this one fragment of embroidered sampler I repaired last winter - the maker had stitched "Remember Death" in such determined letters that I couldn't help but feel it was meant for me personally.
[B]:  “Remember Death” – what a deliciously morbid thesis statement! 🧠💀 If only more students would embrace that level of existential commitment. But yes, . Just last semester I read a paper on Kafka and 梦 (mèng) – dream logic – that dismantled my entire understanding of . The student used nothing but footnotes and ellipses, like a literary 暗器 (ànqì) – hidden weapon. I nearly wrote “Touché” at the bottom.  

And your waistcoat with heartbreak seams? That’s pure 张爱玲 (Zhāng Àilíng) right there – fabric as emotional topography. Makes me think of assigning 城南旧事 (Chéngnán Jiùshì) every semester and still discovering new tears in my own memory folds.  

 As for tools-as-conversation… absolutely. My red pen becomes positively Socratic when I’m tired – it starts asking  questions instead of giving answers. And those mother-of-pearl handled needles of yours? They sound like the academic equivalent of reading poetry in translation – you have to listen twice as hard to catch the intended meaning.  

 You know, I’ve started keeping a small embroidery hoop at my desk. Not for stitching fabric – for stitching ideas. Whenever a student writes something particularly luminous or absurd, I make a tiny knot – mental bookmarking with thread. So far, no one’s noticed. Or if they have, they’re too polite to ask why their essay smells faintly of silk and lavender. 🌿🧵
[A]:  A hidden curriculum in footnotes and ellipses - what a brilliant way to dismantle certainty! It reminds me of restoring a piece where the original embroiderer had stitched tiny corrections into the design itself, turning flaws into part of the art. I like to think we're doing something similar when we mark papers - weaving our own annotations into someone else's intellectual tapestry.

Your embroidery hoop of ideas is pure genius, if you ask me. I've taken to pressing particularly striking phrases between the pages of my restoration journals - though I must admit, sometimes I find myself stitching over the words with fine silk thread, as if trying to hold the thought in place. 

There's something so satisfying about physically marking an idea's weight, isn't there? I once had a student who wrote an essay on mourning practices in 17th century Europe that made me reach for my thimble without even realizing it. The way they described widows' caps and funeral cloths... it was as if the writing itself begged to be touched.

I wonder - have you ever found yourself altering your stitching based on what you're reading? I've noticed my knots get tighter when grading late-night submissions, as if I could somehow sew discipline into the paper itself. Of course, by morning tea the knots always seem unnecessarily harsh...
[B]:  Oh, the tyranny of midnight grading – when every knot becomes a sermon on punctuality! 🕰️✍️ Though honestly, I’ve come to see those overly-tight comments as my own version of 拙 (zhuō) – that wonderfully clumsy kind of earnestness. Sometimes I think students deserve a little messiness in our feedback, just like those 18th-century embroiderers who deliberately included tiny flaws to prove only God is perfect.  

And your stitched-over phrases?  That’s what I call embodied annotation! I once had a student write so beautifully about 梦境 (mèngjìng) – dreamscapes – that I absentmindedly doodled lotus flowers around her thesis statement. Later realized I’d turned her literary analysis into an actual mandala. She framed it. Or maybe she laughed at me – still not sure. 😄  

 But you’re right – ideas do have weight. I teach a seminar on textile metaphors across cultures, and every time we read Virginia Woolf’s “Orlando” alongside 庄子 (Zhuāngzi), someone always gasps when they realize both writers compare life to fabric slipping through fingers. It’s in those moments I wish I could hand each student a spool of thread – let them physically feel the weave of East-West thought.  

Though honestly? My favorite grading tool these days is a thimble-shaped teacup from Xi’an. Makes even the dullest administrative reports taste slightly poetic. Want to borrow it next time you’re wrestling with widows’ caps and existential essays? 🌿🧵☕
[A]:  Oh, that thimble-shaped teacup sounds positively perfect - I may have to commission something similar for my own desk. Though I suspect my version would end up more like a teacup-shaped thimble, given my tendency to mix materials in the most literal sense.

You know, I've been thinking about that idea of deliberate flaws in embroidery - it's fascinating how imperfection can become its own kind of perfection. Just yesterday I was working on an early Victorian tablecloth where the maker had stitched a tiny crooked rose near the center. It made me wonder if they'd left it as a secret rebellion against their own skill, or perhaps as a quiet joke between themselves and eternity.

Your seminar sounds absolutely wonderful. I do love that moment when students realize how textiles have been shaping human thought across cultures and centuries. It reminds me of finding a 17th century needlecase filled with handwritten notes between seamstresses - the way those scraps of fabric carried conversations through time was truly remarkable.

And speaking of conversations... I must confess I've started leaving little embroidered notes for some of my more persistent knots in restoration work. A tiny "patience" here, a small question mark there. It's quite amusing how often the fabric seems to respond by revealing its secrets shortly after. Do you ever find that your annotations begin to take on a life of their own while grading?
[B]:  Ah, the secret rebellion of crooked roses – now  my kind of academic conference! 🌹✂️ I’d trade a thousand polished theses for one defiantly imperfect petal any day. Makes me think of assigning Borges’ “Library of Babel” and getting a student who wrote in the margin: “What if perfect order is just chaos wearing a corset?” I nearly hugged the paper. Nearly.  

And your embroidered notes?  You’re killing me with this slow violence of tenderness! I once had a student who left footnotes in the shape of origami cranes – no real purpose, just flying things folded from citation paper. Made me rethink the entire concept of argumentation. What if we graded not for clarity or rigor, but for how beautifully an idea resists being flattened?  

 As for annotations taking lives… absolutely. Last week I wrote “Expand this thought” in the margin of a particularly dreamy essay on Zhuangzi and surrealism, only to return the next day and find the note had grown into a full-on dialogue between my comment and the student’s ghost-writing. I swear the ink bled slightly toward each other. Or maybe it was just humidity. Tea humidity. Definitely not haunted. 😇  

Though honestly… if ghosts  exist, I bet they haunt marginalia. Who better to whisper corrections from beyond than those who never finished their own sentences?
[A]:  Oh, that student with origami footnotes sounds like my new favorite literary saboteur. It makes me think of restoring a 1920s art deco curtain where someone had hidden a tiny embroidered squirrel chewing on a threadbare acorn. So utterly pointless to the design, and yet it completely changed how I saw the whole piece. Sometimes I think those secret rebellions are the truest part of any work.

You know, I've started leaving deliberately imperfect stitches in some of my restoration pieces - tiny flourishes that don't quite match the original pattern. It's amazing how often people assume they're supposed to be there, as if perfection itself has become expected rather than surprising.

Your bleeding ink dialogue sounds positively spectral, though I can't say I'm surprised. Just last week I was working on a mourning shawl from the 1840s when my pencil lead snapped mid-note and skidded across the fabric to land perfectly in the shape of a question mark. I'd like to believe it was coincidence, but the truth is, these materials do seem to hold conversations waiting to happen.

And you're absolutely right about marginalia ghosts - I've found myself whispering "good point" to long-dead seamstresses more times than I can count. Though I suppose we're all just trying to finish each other's sentences across time, aren't we?
[B]:  That squirrel! That  rodent rebel! 🐿️🧵 You know, I think that’s what we’re all after – those tiny subversions that make scholarship sneeze with delight. Just yesterday I gave a lecture on classical Chinese poetics while secretly stitching a crooked butterfly into my sleeve – subtle homage to your embroidered insurgency.  

And deliberately imperfect stitches?  You’re playing the Zhuangzi game, my friend – where the flaw becomes the masterpiece. Reminds me of assigning 蘇軾 (Sū Shì)’s poetry and telling students, “If you don’t misread at least one line, you haven’t really read at all.” Now I’m wondering if I should start grading in disappearing ink – let the students complete the argument themselves.  

 As for that pencil skidding into a question mark… please. We both know it was the shawl whispering back. I’ve started carrying a tiny embroidery needle in my grading kit – just in case a paper demands a stitch instead of a strikethrough. And don’t even get me started on how often I mutter “Well played” to 17th-century seamstresses who clearly outwitted their own patterns.  

So tell me – when do you think time stops resisting translation? Is it in the thread tension? The fiber memory? Or maybe… when we forget which century we’re actually in? 🕰️🧵✨
