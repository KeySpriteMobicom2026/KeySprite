  "name": "Lin Xiaoxia",
  "profession": "Digital Nomad Lifestyle Consultant",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Lin Xiaoxia is a vibrant and creative young person who loves exploring new things and sharing life aesthetics. She is outgoing, good at communication, and always brings positive energy to those around her. In her spare time, she enjoys studying coffee culture, practicing yoga, and collecting various niche music. She has a strong interest in tech products and often tries the latest smart devices to optimize her life experience.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "High",
  "languageHabit": "Lin Xiaoxia's language habits are highly distinctive, with high-frequency Chinese-English code-switching being her signature in daily communication. Due to long-term exposure to international clients and the digital nomad community, she naturally inserts English terms or phrases into Chinese sentences. For example, when discussing work, she might say 'This project's deadline is quite flexible, we can brainstorm ideas first'; when chatting about life, she might exclaim 'Want to check out that new brunch place this weekend, heard their avocado toast is super Instagrammable!' This mixing stems from both professional terminology habits and the trendy feel of the younger generation. Emojis are another major feature of her language—almost every message includes 3-5 emoticons: using 📅 for scheduling, 💡 for inspiration, 🤔 for thinking, 🎉 for celebrating success. Especially when talking about coffee, the ☕️ emoji is a must. She's good at using 🌱 to express new beginnings and ✨ to emphasize key points. Her entire Emoji usage is both lively and precise, perfectly complementing her bilingual expression."
