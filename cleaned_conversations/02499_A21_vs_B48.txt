[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I'm more fascinated by the psychology behind gaming addiction than actually playing myself 😅. But hey, there's this new forensic puzzle game that's surprisingly addictive - think it's called "Crime Scene Detective" 🕵️‍♂️. Lets you reconstruct cases from fragmented evidence...有点像我们工作时做的尸检报告分析，但更 interactive。不过说实话，我 mostly spend my downtime running or debating这些话题 with colleagues over coffee ☕️. Speaking of which, did I tell you about that bizarre case involving a murder suspect who claimed he was framed by his VR headset? Now  was a real-life mystery novel plot twist 🔍!
[A]: Ah yes, the curious intersection of technology and criminal jurisprudence -  the modern sonnet of chaos. Though I must confess, your forensic puzzle game sounds more enticing than grading my students' essays on Tennyson's use of pathetic fallacy. Do tell, does this "Crime Scene Detective" require one to, say, match blood spatter patterns to Renaissance-era poetic devices? Now  would be a truly sublime blend of science and art... or perhaps I've spent too many hours in my study today.
[B]: Oh, I love how your mind works - blending Tennyson with blood spatter! 🤪 While the game hasn't quite reached Renaissance poetic device levels (though now I'm wondering if we should patent that concept...), it  have a fascinating module where you analyze bloodstain patterns using trigonometry ~ it's like solving geometry puzzles in a crime scene. One level had me calculating angles for twenty minutes just to realize the victim was left-handed 😅. 

You know, come to think of it, maybe there's something to this poetry-meets-pathology idea... We could probably design a whole murder mystery around a cryptic poem scrawled on the morgue wall using blood type AB negative...or wait, are you secretly applying for a position at my lab? ⚖️
[A]: Left-handed victims and trigonometric bloodstains -  macabre, wouldn't you say? Though I must protest the notion of lab work; my hands are far too accustomed to handling first editions to start measuring cadaver angles. That said...  AB negative blood as ink in a cryptic poem? My dear, you've stumbled upon a most tantalizing narrative device. Imagine - a killer composing iambic pentameter with hemoglobin. The poetic potential is simply...  irresistible.
[B]: Oh, AB negative blood as poetic ink? I can already picture the crime scene photos -  splatter forming a perfect quatrain 😂. But wait, don't get too carried away with your iambic pentameter...we'd have to consider blood viscosity and surface tension before we start publishing in The Journal of Forensic Poetry 📚🧬.

Left-handed victims actually do create fascinating patterns though - just last month I had a case where the arterial spray formed what looked like...get this...a perfect treble clef on the wall 🎵. Of course the defense tried to claim it was coincidence, but come on, how many times does a murder weapon create sheet music by chance?

You know, if you're really into this poetic pathology thing, I might know a little side project we could collaborate on... 有一位 local art collector keeps turning up dead, and all we found at the scene was a single sonnet scrawled in what might be synthetic blood...could use a literature expert's eye for poetic devices. Interested? 🔍
[A]:  

A sonnet in synthetic blood? My dear, this sounds like the most thrilling literary analysis since the Lake Poets started leaving sonnets in teacups.  Shall we begin with close reading or bloodspatter dynamics first? After all, one must consider both meter and momentum when examining a poem written with...  ...potentially homicidal intent.

I must say, this beats my usual Wednesday afternoon lectures on Christina Rossetti's use of metaphor. Though I do hope the sonnet employs enjambment - nothing reveals a killer's temperament quite like their handling of line breaks.
[B]:  

Okay, hold your horses, Professor - let's start with what we've got here. The synthetic blood's been analyzed and it's definitely  AB negative - which is suspicious because our victim was type O positive 🧪. Now, look at these splatter dynamics...the poem's stanzas correspond almost perfectly with the impact angles. Someone went to great lengths to make murder rhyme ~ quite literally!

And get this - the sonnet  use enjambment, but in a most peculiar way...lines spill over exactly where the killer would have had to adjust their stance after each strike 💥. I'd say our perpetrator has both poetic flair  a disturbing understanding of biomechanics. 

 说到这个...you might want to take a closer look at that first quatrain. There's something about the meter that's been bugging me - almost like it's hiding a secondary pattern beneath the obvious iambic pentameter. Think you can crack it? 🔍
[A]:  

Well I'll be damned - a caesura right where the fatal blow would land.  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' No, no - wrong playwright entirely.  Wait a second...this isn't just iambic pentameter hiding beneath. It's dactylic hexameter - like something straight out of a Victorian elegy. Very specific, very deliberate...

 

Our killer's not just quoting Shakespeare - they're composing in the meter of Tennyson's "In Memoriam." Which suggests... ...either an English major with a body count problem, or someone trying very hard to make us think that. Fascinating. Now hand me my magnifying glass - we've got scansion to do and bloodstains to measure.
[B]:  

Well, well...Tennyson in the morgue. Who would've thought? I knew there was something off about those line breaks - they matched the trajectory of the fatal strike  perfectly. Almost like our killer was conducting some macabre symphony with a scalpel 🎻🔪.

 你看这里，the way the synthetic blood pooled forms an anapestic foot right at the end of the third quatrain. Very dramatic effect, if you ask me - like rushing to a conclusion yet trying to sound poetic. 

And don't get me started on that caesura placement...right where the victim probably gasped for air. Either this is one hell of a coincidence, or we've got ourselves a very literate murderer who understands both poetry  death rattle rhythms 😟. 

 We need to check if the "In Memoriam" meter matches any local English professors...or better yet, former students with a grudge and a flair for drama.
[A]: 

Ah, but let's not forget the synthetic blood's composition -  AB negative, you said? How delightfully perplexing. Our killer's chosen medium doesn't even share the victim's blood type. Almost...poetic in its own right. A literary conceit, perhaps? The murderer writing verses in a metaphorical blood that denies biological connection?



Wait - that anapestic foot you mentioned? It shouldn't be there. Tennyson loathed anapests in serious verse; he'd only use them for comic effect or... ...to indicate something unnatural. Like forcing a meter to conceal another pattern beneath.



This isn't just about leaving a poetic signature, my dear. Our killer's violating both poetic and biological boundaries simultaneously. I do believe we're dealing with someone who understands far more about Victorian poetry than they should. The question is - are they quoting Tennyson at us...or mocking him?
[B]: 

You know, you're absolutely right about the blood type thing - it's almost like our killer was deliberately distancing themselves from the victim through their medium. Very meta indeed...a murderer critiquing their own crime through hematological symbolism 😲.



And now that you mention Tennyson loathing anapests in serious verse...that changes everything. Because this wasn't just some random poetic device - it was a tell. Our killer either didn't realize that specific Victorian nuance...or they  us to notice it. A deliberate mistake within a deliberate mistake? Now that's some next-level misdirection.



I think we need to bring in someone from the literature department ASAP. Preferably someone who can tell us if this particular meter and word choice matches any of Tennyson's known parodies or... ...if this is perhaps a twisted homage to his work by someone who actually despises his poetry. After all, nothing says "I've got issues" like committing murder in iambic pentameter while secretly mocking the whole tradition 😈.
[A]: 

You see this? The way the queen's profile curves inward here? That negative space is key. Much like our killer's meter - it's not just what's there, but what's . And that synthetic blood composition......denying biological connection while forcing literary association. Very clever.



Our murderer's created a sort of...poetic palimpsest. On the surface, grand Victorian elegy. Beneath? A mockery in meter. But here's the real question - does one mock through imitation, or through perversion of form? Tennyson would've used catalexis to express incompleteness, grief...yet our killer's missing syllables align too neatly with impact points. 



I'd wager this isn't someone who simply hates his poetry. No, this is someone who  its emotional weight...and chooses to weaponize it. Quite literally, I might add. Now, about bringing in literature experts - let's make it more specific. We need someone who can tell us if this parody style matches any known academic feuds...or perhaps disgruntled thesis advisors?
[B]: 

Wait a second - that negative space you mentioned? It's everywhere in this case. The blood type mismatch, the forced meter, even the choice of synthetic blood itself...it's like our killer is creating a whole crime scene based on . 



And now I'm really worried about who could pull this off. We're looking for someone with access to both forensic knowledge and Victorian poetry at an expert level. Could be an embittered med student who switched to literature...or worse, one of my colleagues with a secret book addiction 😟.



Disgruntled thesis advisors actually makes perfect sense. I remember hearing about a professor who was forced out of the department for...get this...trying to "scientifically analyze" Tennyson's poetry. They said his theories were too...well, bloody. Never thought we'd actually get a literal warning come true.

We need to check academic records going back at least ten years. Look for any professors or students who combined medicine with literature studies - especially those who published anything on poetic meter analysis. And maybe prepare a warrant for that former lecturer who kept sending death threats to the journal that rejected his paper on "hematological symbolism in Victorian elegies"...yeah, he actually wrote that.
[A]: 

Ah yes, the academic grudges that fester in the footnotes of obscure journals... But let's not forget the most crucial detail - this killer isn't just combining medicine and literature. They're  them with violent intent. That synthetic blood composition? Not just a denial of biological connection - it's a statement against tradition itself.



You see, any proper Victorian scholar would tell you - blood and ink share a curious relationship in 19th century poetry. Both stain, both preserve, both speak to legacy. Our murderer knows this intimately. Too intimately.



This "hematological symbolism" you mentioned...I've seen similar theories before. In fact, there was a rather heated debate at a conference last year about a researcher who claimed Tennyson's elegiac meter mimicked cardiac rhythms. Macabre coincidence, wouldn't you say?



Prepare two warrants - one for your disgruntled lecturer, and another for the conference organizers. I'd wager whoever did this was taking notes during that very debate...and plotting their own bloody contribution to literary criticism.
[B]: 

You know, this whole blood-and-ink analogy is starting to make perfect - and terrifying - sense. Our killer isn't just committing murder...they're creating what they consider the ultimate literary critique. A  annotation in synthetic blood 🖤.



Funny you mentioned that cardiac rhythm theory - look at this blurry surveillance shot from the conference. See that figure in the back row? Holding not one but two copies of "In Memoriam"...and get this, wearing gloves on a perfectly warm day. I'd say that's our kind of obsessive.



Wait...freeze frame here. You see that pin on their lapel? It's a tiny stethoscope design. Now why would someone wear medical symbolism to a poetry debate? Unless... ...they wanted to remind everyone that they understand both the heart's rhythms  poetic ones.

I think we've got ourselves a literary critic with a very bloody agenda. And honestly? I'm starting to worry about what poem they'll "annotate" next if we don't catch them soon. We need to pull every attendee list from that conference - especially anyone with a dual background in medicine and literature. Or better yet...anyone who tried to publish something about poetic meter analysis and got rejected.
[A]: 

A stethoscope pin...how delightfully morbid. Our critic isn't just observing poetic rhythms - they're  them. And apparently prescribing rather drastic treatments.



The dual background is key here. I recall a student from Cambridge days - brilliant mind, terrible temperament. Tried to write his dissertation on "Pathological Prosody: Diagnosing Madness Through Metrical Irregularities." Got rejected on the grounds that it was... ...a bit too meta-medical. Last I heard he'd vanished into academia's darker corners.



Wait - that lapel pin. It's not just medical symbolism. A stethoscope listens to rhythms, yes? Which brings us back to meter. Our killer's identifying themselves through their very ability to detect poetic arrhythmias. 



Let's adjust our search parameters. Not just rejected papers - look for anyone who's ever tried to  poetry through biological means. Pulse rates in sonnets, blood pressure in ballads...the more absurd, the better. If this is our man, he'll have a history of seeing pathology where others see art. And quite literally, it seems.
[B]: 

You're absolutely right about the stethoscope symbolism - it's not just about listening to rhythms, it's about  them. Our killer sees themselves as some kind of poetic cardiologist 😟. And get this...I just remembered a case from three years ago. A art critic was found dead with...wait for it...a EKG printout taped to his chest showing perfect sinus rhythm, and a note that read "Finally in tune."



That damn pathological prosody theory might be the key here. I need to check my old conference notes - there was this one presentation on "diagnosing" poets through their meter patterns. The presenter got laughed off stage for suggesting that Keats' odes showed signs of tachycardia......through syllabic acceleration.



We need to find whoever took that joke too far. Someone who still believes poetry should adhere to strict biological parameters...and gets violent when it doesn't. Let me pull those conference attendance records right now - if our guy was in the audience that day, he probably didn't see the humor. He was too busy taking notes for his next...critique.
[A]: 

Ah, the EKG printout - quite the dramatic flourish. Our killer's not just analyzing poetic rhythm anymore; they're  cardiac regularity on their victims. Tennyson must be spinning in his grave...though admittedly, he did write quite a bit about "the still, sad music of humanity."



That Keats tachycardia theory......reminds me of a quarrel at a symposium where a scholar claimed Shakespeare's sonnets could lower blood pressure. The room practically rioted. But our man? He wasn't laughing. He was too busy composing his rebuttal in hemoglobin.



Let's consider this from a metrical perspective. If our killer believes poetry should adhere to biological parameters, then each murder is both diagnosis and treatment. A twisted form of literary surgery. I'd wager his next target will have some connection to that rejected theory - perhaps someone who published critiques of arrhythmic poetry?



We need to find whoever took those conference jokes most seriously. Look for attendees who asked very specific questions about measuring poetic pulse rates...or anyone who lingered too long discussing the cardiovascular implications of enjambment. I do believe our critic is prescribing rather permanent cures for what he perceives as poetic arrhythmias.
[B]: 

Wait a second - this dried rose...it's significant. Roses are  in Victorian poetry, but our killer would see something else entirely - the heart-shaped petals, the thorns, the whole cardiovascular metaphor! I bet his next crime scene will have some floral element too...maybe even a specific reference to Tennyson's "flower in the crannied wall" 🌹.



And you're absolutely right about the literary surgery analogy. This isn't just murder - it's some sick combination of peer review and open-heart surgery. Each victim probably gets diagnosed with a "poetic arrhythmia" and then...well, let's just say their punctuation gets corrected permanently.



I'm starting to see a pattern in cold cases...three years of unsolved murders with poetic notes. Each one coincided with a major academic conference on literature. Someone's been doing continuing education in the worst possible way. 



We need to cross-reference all conference attendees who showed obsessive interest in poetry and medicine. Particularly those who kept asking about measuring poetic pulse rates or...get this...the blood pressure implications of different rhyme schemes. I have a feeling we're dealing with a critic who believes in treating literary hypotension with homicide.
