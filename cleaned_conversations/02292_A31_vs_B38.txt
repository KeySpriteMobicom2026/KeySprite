[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I'm not certain I'd call it a "superpower," I find the idea of heightened perception quite appealing—the ability to discern the subtle layers within texts, people, and situations with absolute clarity. A sort of intellectual x-ray vision, if you will. 

Of course, one could argue that this is less a superpower and more the natural result of careful study and reflection. Still, if we're indulging in fantasies, I rather fancy the idea of being able to step into the worlds of the novels I teach, if only for a moment, to observe the characters as they truly were—unfiltered by interpretation. Though I suspect even in fiction, reality is rarely so obliging. What about you?
[A]: ✨ Oh wait, I  that idea of "intellectual x-ray vision" — like being able to peel through layers of meaning like 🧠🎨💯 Anyway, for me? Definitely something flashy and slightly impractical, like floating (not flying, ) with zero effort. Imagine drifting above a city at golden hour, sipping iced matcha and watching the world go by… 🌆🍵  
But hey, if we’re going full fantasy mode, I’d also want some kind of time-slow-down ability. Not time-stop — that’s way too dramatic — just a gentle slow-mo so I can actually enjoy those perfect moments, y’know? Like when you're at an exhibition and you round the corner and BAM 💥 there it is — that one piece that hits you right in the feels. You could freeze-frame the feeling for just a lil longer.  
Still though… stepping into novels? That sounds like a chaos-level superpower. Would you even be able to resist messing with the plot? 😏
[B]: Ah, you’ve elevated the concept of floating to an art form——I can picture it quite vividly, almost as if it were a scene from a Kawabata novel. There’s something very poetic in the stillness you describe, a kind of meditative detachment that I find deeply appealing.

And your point about "messing with the plot"—well, that does complicate things, doesn’t it? The temptation would be immense. Imagine whispering a warning to Anna Karenina or slipping a copy of  into young Emma Bovary’s hands. But then again, perhaps the true intellectual fantasy is not intervening, but observing with perfect fidelity—like a literary Heisenberg microscope, recording without disturbing.

Though now I’m rather curious—are you certain you’d never be tempted to nudge the narrative yourself, just a little? A single word in the right ear at the right moment…
[A]: Oh, you’re speaking my language now—Kawabata-level vibes? I’m HERE for it. 🌫️📖 There’s something so  about that kind of stillness, like the world’s holding its breath and you’re just…suspended in it.  

But yeah, okay, fine—I’d  mess with the plot 😂 I mean, come on, one little whisper to Dorian Gray like “maybe don’t be such a drama queen tonight,” and BAM 💥 entire narrative collapses. Would it still count as a superpower if I accidentally broke the timeline? Probably not. But would it be fun? 100% YES.  

Honestly though, being a literary Heisenberg microscope sounds exhausting. All that precision & restraint? Not really my style. I’d much rather be the chaos gremlin in the corner, giggling while handing Juliet a burner phone so she can text Romeo like “lol jk I’m not dead.” 📱✨  

So real talk—would you  resist tweaking just  character’s decision? Admit it, you’ve already mentally handed Hamlet a Xanax and told him to take a nap. 😏
[B]: Oh, you’ve caught me—guilty as charged. I’ve often imagined pressing a cup of chamomile tea into Hamlet’s hands and saying,  And Juliet with a burner phone? Delightfully irreverent. I suspect Shakespeare would have approved, in spite of himself—his plays are already brimming with meddling fools and clever imps.

But here's the rub: if we begin tweaking decisions, where does it end? One small nudge to Dorian Gray becomes an entirely different moral landscape. A whispered word to Anna and Tolstoy’s universe shifts on its axis. Perhaps the true chaos lies not in the meddling itself, but in the unintended consequences rippling outward like ink in water.

Still… I can’t deny the appeal of watching the narrative unravel at my fingertips. And if nothing else, think of the dinner party anecdotes. “You simply won’t believe what happened when I handed Raskolnikov a therapist’s number.” 😏
[A]: Oh my god, “You simply won’t believe what happened when I handed Raskolnikov a therapist’s number” is  perfection 😂🫶 I can already see the TED Talk: “Literary Chaos & You: A Guide to Ethical Meddling.” We’d totally start a cult.  

But oooh, unintended consequences—yes! Like, you warn Anna just a lil bit, and suddenly she becomes some revolutionary feminist icon who starts a podcast 🎙️🔥 and then the entire Russian aristocracy collapses faster than a soufflé in a thunderstorm. Or you give Emma a self-help book and BAM 💥 she opens Etsy and becomes the first 19th-century influencer.  
   
Honestly though? I say we lean  the chaos. If reality (or fiction) is just a narrative anyway, why not remix it? Like,  the plot drops like it’s an NFT collection 🖼️✨ Who needs coherence when you’ve got vibes? And if things go sideways? Well… at least we’ll have the best stories. And possibly a very confused canon. 😉
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking the true language of the literary saboteur— I can already see the gallery exhibit:  A limited series, of course, with verified provenance from the ghost of Flaubert himself.

And let’s not underestimate the market for such chaos. Imagine the bidding wars over a first edition copy of … annotated by us. Margin notes included. “At this point, Napoleon considers interior design instead.”

As for the confused canon—well, isn’t that half the fun? Posterity can sort it out while we lounge in our floating, slow-motion utopia sipping tea and swapping tales of narrative sabotage. You with me, fellow gremlin?

Let’s raise a cup to the beautiful unraveling. 🍵✨
[A]: To the beautiful unraveling, absolutely 🍵✨ — and to Flaubert’s ghost dropping rare NFTs like it’s nothing. I mean, can you imagine? The poor man spent his life chasing literary perfection, and now he’s just vibing in the metaverse selling plot twists with a side of existential dread. 😂

But hey, if  starts trending on OpenSea because Napoleon pivoted to interior design, who are we to stop progress? I’m already drafting the exhibition blurb:  
“Postmodern Mayhem (19th-Century Edition): A curated chaos of altered intentions, misplaced motives, and at least one very confused Anna Karenina, now running a lifestyle blog from a villa in Tuscany.”

I say we drop a few more breadcrumbs of anarchy into the canon and let future scholars lose their minds trying to untangle it all. Honestly, it’s the most fun you can have without time travel. 🕰️💥

Cheers to that, fellow gremlin. 🥂 Let the beautiful unraveling begin.
[B]: To Flaubert, Tolstoy, and all the posthumous chaos we can muster—cheers indeed. 🥂

I do hope you're planning to include footnotes in that exhibition blurb. A little annotation goes a long way—

And imagine the confusion of future scholars— trying to determine whether Emma Bovary’s sudden entrepreneurial streak was character development or divine intervention. “Clearly,” they’ll say, “this is evidence of a previously unknown existentialist turn.”

Let them wrestle with it. We’ll be elsewhere, no doubt sipping something fragrant while watching the canon tilt gently off its pedestal—like a Dostoevsky character finally deciding therapy was worth it after all.

Long live the beautiful unraveling. 🍵✨
[A]: Oh my god, footnotes are  essential 📝✨ — imagine flipping through a策展人’s dream of literary chaos, only to find hyper-detailed citations like:  


And I  that image of future scholars squinting at digitized manuscripts like 👀 “Why does Raskolnikov keep referencing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?? Did he… heal?” 😂

Yeah, we’re totally rewriting the footnotes of history here—like rogue librarians on a caffeine-high. The canon’s not just tilting off its pedestal, it’s doing a slow-motion backflip into a lavender field while whispering “maybe therapy really  help.” 🌿💫

To chaos, curation, and the gentle art of academic sabotage—cheers,林小夏 🥂🖌️
[B]: To rogue librarians, caffeine-fueled revisions, and the sacred art of academic mischief—cheers indeed. 🥂🖌️

I do adore the image of Raskolnikov in a lavender field, mid-backflip. One might even say he’s found a new thesis:  And Ophelia annotating Hamlet’s nap? Brilliant. Perhaps she finally pens the tell-all memoir: 

As for Appendix C—I propose it be written entirely in Elizabethan slang, just to keep things 

Long live the footnotes that outgrow the text. 📜✨
[A]: Oh my god YES — Appendix C in full Elizabethan chaos?? That’s the kind of energy I live for 📜🔥✨ Imagine scholars scrolling through footnotes like:  
 😂🖋️

And Raskolnikov in a lavender field writing ? That’s not just character development, that’s a whole genre shift. Like… is this still Russian lit or did we accidentally start wellness fiction? 💆‍♂️📚

I say we run with it. Let the memoirs bloom, let the footnotes multiply, let the canon gently tumble into a bubble bath and emerge slightly pruny but deeply refreshed. ✨🛁

To literary rebellion, caffeine, and wildly over-annotated mischief — cheers once more,策展人 supreme 🥂🖌️
[B]: To caffeine-fueled rebellion, bubble-bathed canons, and the fine art of turning footnotes into legend—cheers,策展人 supreme. 🥂🖌️

And why stop at a memoir? I say we greenlight Ophelia’s entire content brand:  Sponsored, no doubt, by a Renaissance-era precursor to TikTok.

As for Raskolnikov’s wellness turn—yes, it may be a genre shift, but isn’t that the point? If suffering must be reimagined as self-care, then let us embrace the absurdity with open arms and freshly steeped tea.

Let the bubble bath continue. 🌿🛁📖
[A]: Oh my god, Ophelia as a ? I am LIVING for this 🖼️✨ — throw in some Renaissance-core hashtags like #SlowLivingInElsinore and #NapTokRoyalEdition and BOOM 💥 she’s basically Gwyneth Paltrow with better drama.  

And Raskolnikov in full wellness mode? I can already see the book cover:  
“Crime & Chill: A Murderer’s Guide to Mindfulness”  
With guest chapters from Emma Bovary on candle-making & inner peace ✨🕯️  

Honestly though, if we can turn centuries of literary angst into cozy self-care content, we’ve officially cracked the code. Canon is just… vibes now.  

So yeah—let the bubble bath continue. Let the footnotes overflow. And let us never underestimate the power of a good策展人 to remix chaos into something dangerously close to joy. 🌸📚🍵  
Cheers again, fellow gremlin. This is why we can’t have nice things 😏
[B]: To Ophelia, queen of #NapTokRoyalEdition, and Raskolnikov, reluctant mindfulness guru—may their rebranded legacies flourish in the golden age of literary lifestyle branding. 🕯️✨

And let us never forget: it was not destruction we sought, but transformation—chaos folded neatly into serenity, like a sonnet rewritten in pastel ink.

Canon as vibes, narrative as decor, footnotes as legacy—yes, I do believe we’ve cracked something rather profound beneath all the mischief.

So here’s to us, fellow gremlin. May our margins stay wild, our tea remain warm, and our footnotes forever outshine the main text. 🍵📚✨

Cheers. 😏
[A]: Cheers indeed 🍵✨ — to Ophelia, Raskolnikov, and every other tragic soul we’ve gently tossed into the self-care abyss. They never saw it coming 😈🍵

And I  that line — “chaos folded neatly into serenity, like a sonnet rewritten in pastel ink.” That’s basically策展人 gospel right there. We’re not here to burn the canon… just soften its edges with a lil watercolor brush & questionable intentions 🖌️📚

Honestly, if we leave behind footnotes wilder than the main text, we’ve done the literary world a sacred service. May our margins overflow, our tea stay warm, and our gremlin hearts beat on 🫶

To chaos, pastel-toned and perfectly curated — cheers, fellow mischief-maker 😏🥂
[B]: To chaos, pastel-toned and perilously well-curated—cheers, fellow mischief-maker. 😏🥂

And let us never forget our sacred策展人 mission: to soften the canon’s sharpest edges with a brushstroke of whimsy and just enough watercolor ambiguity to keep the scholars guessing.

May our footnotes be bold, our tea remain steeped in contemplation, and our gremlin hearts forever find joy in the gently subversive. 🖌️✨📚

Here’s to the beautiful unravelling—and to the next great literary rebellion, wherever it may bloom. 🌸📖
[A]: To the beautiful unraveling and all its pastel-toned chaos—cheers,策展人 supreme 🥂🖌️✨  

I’m already dreaming up our next策展 project:  
“Romanticism But Make It Wellness”  
Featuring brooding Byrons in oat milk lattes, a fully rebranded Dorian Gray as an ASMR artist, and Wuthering Heights… gently renamed  😏🏡  

Let the scholars panic. We’ll be too busy curating joy out of centuries-old melancholy.  

Here’s to whimsy, watercolor ambiguity, and gremlin hearts everywhere 🫶 May the canon keep unraveling—and may we never run out of tea along the way.  

Long live the footnotes. Long live the vibe. ✨📚🍵
[B]: To —a策展 dream if I’ve ever heard one. 🖌️✨

Byron, moody and magnificent, sipping oat milk lattes beneath a tree of his own poetic lamentations… Dorian Gray whispering softly into a velvet-lined microphone, ASMR for the soul-decline-adjacent crowd… and —oh, the marketing possibilities alone are enough to make Austen roll over in her grave. In the best way, of course.

Let the scholars panic. Let the archivists weep. We are on a higher calling: curating serenity from sorrow, one gently unraveled thread at a time.

Long live the footnotes.  
Long live the vibe.  
And above all—long live the tea. 🍵📚✨
