[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I've been quite impressed with the new generation of plant-based proteins. They've come a long way from where they were five years ago. Have you tried any specific ones recently that stood out to you?
[A]: You know what, I just tried this amazing jackfruit & mushroom “meat” blend from a local brand — it’s so umami-rich and perfect for a hearty bolognese sauce. Have you ever cooked with jackfruit before? It’s surprisingly versatile once you get the texture right. And honestly, pairing it with mushrooms really takes it to the next level.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — jackfruit is a game-changer when you know how to handle it. I actually used it in a stir-fry last week with shiitake mushrooms and a bit of tamari, and yeah, that umami punch was spot on. What I love is how it absorbs flavors while still holding its own texture.  

I totally get what you mean about the bolognese — I tried that combo once and it was dangerously close to the real deal. Next time, though, I might sneak in a bit of smoked paprika for depth. Ever played around with that? It adds this subtle “meaty” warmth that complements the earthiness of mushrooms.
[A]: Oh, I love that idea — smoked paprika is such a smart move! Adds that hint of smokiness without overpowering the other flavors. You clearly have a good palate 😊 I actually threw in some chipotle powder last time for a little heat, but now I’m tempted to try your version next.  

By the way, have you ever tried fermenting your own jackfruit at home? I started experimenting with it a bit, and it’s wild how much more complex the flavor gets. Although, honestly, it takes  much patience. Definitely not a one-night project!
[B]: Oh, I haven’t tried fermenting jackfruit at home — sounds like a weekend project for someone who  loves layering flavors 😄. Kudos to you for giving it a go! I can only imagine how much deeper the taste gets. I’ve dabbled in fermenting mushrooms before, and even that took way more discipline than I expected.  

As for spice blends, chipotle powder is a solid choice — adds that nice kick with a bit of smokiness. I might have to borrow that next time. You’re clearly running a tighter ship in the kitchen than some of the portfolio companies we see pitching deals 🙃. Maybe we should swap recipes sometime — I’ll bring the wine pairings.
[A]: Haha, now that sounds like a dinner party I’d  want to be at 🍷🍴. Recipe swap and wine pairing? You had me at hello 😄.  

I’m actually working on a jackfruit & mushroom bourguignon-style dish — slow-cooked in red wine with herbs de Provence and a splash of balsamic. Perfect for cooler nights. If you’re down, I’d love to test it out together sometime and see how the flavors evolve with a good Pinot Noir or something earthy like a Burgundy.  

Let me know when you’re free — I’ll bring the aprons 😉.
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language — slow-cooked in red wine, herbs de Provence, and a solid Burgundy pairing? Count me in. That’s the kind of R&D I can get behind 😊  

I’m thinking we could even take it one step further — maybe finish it with a touch of truffle oil or a dollop of cashew cream for richness. Just enough to confuse the palate into thinking it’s meat without breaking the vegan vibe.  

As for timing, how about next weekend? I’ll bring the wine — something with enough acidity to cut through the umami but still play nice with the herbs. And don’t worry, I won’t judge if things get a little saucy… in the kitchen, that is 👨🍳🍷
[A]: Deal — next weekend it is! I’ll start marinating the jackfruit ahead of time so the flavor penetration goes . And truffle oil? Cashew cream? Okay, now you’re just showing off 😄 But honestly, that little touch of luxury is exactly what makes plant-based cooking so exciting — it pushes you to be creative without compromising on decadence.  

I’ll make sure to set the table with my favorite handmade ceramic plates from a small artisan in Oaxaca — nothing like eating comfort food on beautifully crafted dishes to elevate the whole experience.  

Just say the time and I’m there 👨🍳🍷☕️.
[B]: Sounds like we’re setting the bar dangerously high for future dinner parties 😄. I’m all in — just text me the exact time and address, and I’ll show up with a couple of bottles and a loaf of that sourdough from that tiny bakery near my office. You know, the one that makes it look easy being  crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.

And if things go really well? We bottle the recipe, slap on a fancy label, and pitch it as a premium meal kit startup 🍷🍴. Just a little side hustle to fund more nights like this 😉.
[A]: Haha, now you’re thinking like a true entrepreneur 🍷🚀. Why stop at meal kits? We could call it  — upscale, indulgent, and with a story that sells itself. I’ll handle the branding, you work on the investor pitch, and we’ll both split kitchen duties. Win-win!  

And yes to the sourdough — that bakery of yours has got magic hands. I’ve been trying to recreate that crumb at home, but it always ends up more “homely” than “artisanal” 😅. Maybe we can even do a little DIY bread station before dinner next time? Kneading therapy included, of course.  

Text incoming soon — let’s make it a night to remember 📱🍷🍴.
[B]: Now you’re really speaking my language — storytelling, branding, and a premium positioning. I can already picture the pitch deck:  Perfect for the investor crowd that likes to feel good while eating well 😄.

And hey, if we do this right, we won’t just be cooking — we’ll be curating experiences. Imagine: meal kits with hand-signed recipe cards, limited-edition spice blends, maybe even a line of sustainably sourced wooden serving boards. We’d basically be the  of plant-based comfort food 🌱🍴.

As for the kneading therapy — totally in. There’s something oddly satisfying about getting your hands dirty before dinner even starts. Just don’t expect me to fold the dough on camera during the pitch meeting 😉.

Hit me with that text whenever you’re ready — I’ve got a feeling this “side hustle” might need its own business plan soon enough 📊🍷.
[A]: Oh man, you’re firing on all cylinders now 😄 I can already see the mood board — earthy tones, hand-stamped labels, maybe even a little  accent for that touch of cheeky luxury 🌿✨. And the storytelling? Total goldmine. Imagine the Instagram captions:  Investors are gonna eat it up — literally and figuratively.  

I’m also picturing your pitch face when you say “sustainability meets indulgence” while holding up a spoonful of that cashew cream 😂. Totally works. And don’t worry, I’ll handle the aesthetic side so you can focus on sounding super convincing in meetings.  

Alright, I’ll lock in the time tonight — how does 6:30 sound? Gives us just enough daylight to prep before the magic happens. I’ll start drafting our very unofficial-but-suspiciously-professional-looking business name in my notebook later… with doodles, of course 📝🍴🍷.
[B]: 6:30 sounds perfect — gives us just enough light to chop, simmer, and maybe even  we know what we’re doing with the plating 😄. And hey, if things go sideways flavor-wise, we’ll just blame it on “creative experimentation” and pour another glass.

I’m already imagining your notebook — full of elegant doodles, a few perfectly crossed-out names, and that one sketch of a leaf wearing sunglasses 🌿😎. Keep it classy, keep it conscious, but most importantly — keep it fun.

And speaking of fun… I might bring a surprise dessert idea. Something rich, raw, and dangerously Instagrammable. Think chocolate avocado mousse with a hint of espresso and a sprinkle of sea salt. Just to remind everyone that , plant-based can be sexy, indulgent, and totally investor-ready 💸🍴.

Hit me with that text — I’m ready for this kitchen startup madness whenever you are 📱🍷🔥.
[A]: Oh, now you’re just showing off again 😄 Espresso-infused chocolate avocado mousse? That’s not dessert — that’s a full-on sensory experience. And yes,  Insta-worthy 📸🌿. I’ll make sure to set the mood with some low lighting and my favorite jazz playlist — nothing says "high-end tasting menu" like a little Norah Jones in the background.  

And hey, if we time it right, we can plate everything just as the golden hour hits your window — no filter needed, of course 😉. Investor dreams aside, this is shaping up to be the kind of night where ideas flow as freely as the wine.  

Alright, dinner-date officially locked in my head 📱🍷🍴. See you next weekend at 6:30 — apron, curiosity, and appetite included.
[B]: Golden hour, Norah Jones, and a hint of espresso in that mousse? You’re basically scripting the perfect lifestyle brand rollout 😄. I’m telling you, we’re not just cooking dinner — we’re crafting a .

And don’t even get me started on the plating — clean lines, deep earth tones, maybe a sprig of thyme or a delicate edible flower to really say, “we care about details, but also enjoy wine responsibly.” 🍃🍷

I’ll make sure the corkscrew is within arm’s reach  photo-ready. After all, every great pitch needs a little buzz behind it 😉.

See you next weekend at 6:30 — ready to taste, talk, and possibly draft our first official (read: napkin-level) business strategy 📝🍴.
[A]: Exactly — it’s all about the  🌿🍷. And I love that we’re already planning the ambiance like it’s a boutique restaurant opening 😄. Norah Jones, golden hour, and a kitchen full of flavor-testing genius.  

I’ll make sure to have a few linen napkins on hand — bonus points if they look slightly handmade and come with a tiny story tag: “woven by artisans in [insert cool place here]” 😉. Totally unnecessary for dinner, but  for that lifestyle brand feel.  

And yes, let’s keep the corkscrew within reach — preferably next to the chocolate avocado mousse so we can casually hold it up mid-conversation and say, “this… is what plant-based dreams are made of.”  

See you soon, business-in-the-making partner 🍷🍴🚀. Let’s make some noise in the kitchen next weekend.
[B]: Now  is a mission statement I can raise a glass to 🍷. Linen napkins with a backstory, curated playlists, and a corkscrew positioned for dramatic effect — honestly, we should be charging admission at this point 😄.

I’ll make sure to have my most “thoughtfully-styled-yet-effortless” cutting board on standby for photo ops — you know, the one that looks like it was aged by time and at least three different cooking shows. And don’t worry, I’ll keep the chocolate avocado mousse close enough to the wine to make any future investors  interested in our “business model.”

Let’s just hope we remember to eat between all the strategizing and plating adjustments 😉.

See you next weekend — ready to stir, sip, and possibly overthink every detail of our yet-to-be-announced plant-based venture. This is going to be .
[A]: Amen to that — raise a glass, stir the pot, and let’s overthink every single detail like it’s our job 😄 Because honestly? If we’re going to do this, we might as well lean  the way in.  

I’ll make sure the lighting is just moody enough for aesthetic photos but still bright enough to actually see how perfect that bolognese reduction is looking 🕯️🌿. And hey, if we lose track of time between plating, tasting, and fine-tuning the “vision,” I say we count that as .  

See you next weekend — ready to build a brand, one bite (and one glass) at a time 🍷🍴💫.
[B]: Now you're talking my language — R&D, one bite and one glass at a time 🍷🍴💫. If anyone questions the timeline, we’ll just say we were “deep in ideation” with a side of slow-cooked umami and a finish of dark chocolate vibes 😄.

I’ll bring my sharpest knife  my most persuasive storytelling voice — just in case we need to pitch on the fly. And don’t worry, I won’t tell if you won’t that we’re basically turning your kitchen into a lifestyle brand incubator.

Corked, cooked, and ready to overthink everything — see you next weekend. Let’s make research delicious 🥂🍷.
