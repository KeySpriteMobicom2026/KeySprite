[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: As a forensic psychiatrist with a demanding schedule, I must say meal preparation is quite essential for maintaining both physical and mental health. I typically dedicate Sunday afternoons to preparing balanced meals for the week - lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and plenty of vegetables. Nutrition plays a significant role in cognitive function, you see.
[A]: 哇~这个meal prep的routine很professional啊！💡 作为综艺制作人，我的schedule也是crazy busy，但meal prep对我来说更像是creative process呢~ 🎬 我喜欢把各种cuisine混搭，比如Korean BBQ + Italian pasta这种fusion style！😂 你的nutrition plan听起来很scientific，要不要来我们节目分享下？🌟
[B]: I appreciate the invitation, but I must maintain professional boundaries regarding my media appearances. My expertise lies in forensic psychiatry and medical-legal consultation, not culinary arts. That being said, I would caution against excessive dietary experimentation - the human digestive system responds best to consistent, scientifically validated nutritional patterns. Korean BBQ with Italian pasta sounds particularly disruptive to glycemic control.
[A]: Haha~ 你这也太serious了吧！😅 在entertainment industry里，我们追求的就是这种unexpected的combination啊！🔥 不过你说得对，health确实很重要~ 我们节目最近就在策划一档health & wellness的segment，要不要来当个consultant？🎬 保证不会让你做任何compromise professional ethics的事情！🌟
[B]: While I admire your enthusiasm for health programming, I must decline. My consulting work is strictly limited to forensic psychiatric evaluations and legal testimony. The entertainment industry's approach to health topics often lacks the scientific rigor I require. However, I would recommend contacting the American Psychiatric Association if you're seeking medically sound advice for your segment.
[A]: Okay okay~ 完全respect你的professionalism！👌 不过说真的，我们做reality show的时候经常遇到contestants有mental health issues，maybe我们可以collab一下behind the scenes？💡 不是on camera的那种，just some professional advice~ 毕竟mental health在showbiz里也是big issue啊！🎬
[B]: That's a more appropriate inquiry. I'd be willing to provide limited off-camera consultation regarding mental health protocols for reality television participants. The psychological welfare of individuals in high-stress entertainment environments is indeed a serious matter. My standard retainer fee is $450 per hour, with a four-hour minimum engagement. All consultations would require signed confidentiality agreements and adherence to HIPAA regulations, naturally.
[A]: Wow~ 这个rate比我们的celebrity guests还要high啊！😂 But totally worth it for professional expertise！🌟 Let me discuss with ourproduction team and get back to you~ 🎬 顺便问下，你平时看reality TV吗？Just curious about yourperspective~ 😉
[B]: I don't watch reality television as a rule - the psychological manipulation inherent in the genre is professionally disturbing. However, I've reviewed several cases where participants required psychiatric intervention after appearing on such programs. If we proceed with consultation, I would need full access to your casting protocols and aftercare procedures. Ethical considerations cannot be compromised, regardless of entertainment value.
[A]: Got it~ 看来我们industry还有很多room for improvement啊！💡 你的input肯定会让我们show变得更responsible~ 🌟 我会让legal team准备paperwork，然后schedule一个meeting！🎬 虽然你说不看reality TV，但maybe可以catch一下我们的new season？Just for research purpose~ 😂
[B]: I'll review your materials strictly as case studies, not as entertainment. Please have your legal team forward the documents to my office at least two weeks prior to our scheduled meeting. And remember - no cameras, no promotional references to my involvement, and absolutely no expectation that I'll become a regular viewer. Professional detachment is paramount in these matters.
[A]: Crystal clear！👍 100% respect yourterms~ 我们的assistant会handle all the paperwork and logistics！🌟 虽然不能mention你的involvement，但knowing our show will be moreethical already makes me excited！🎬 期待我们的collab~ 保持in touch！📱
[B]: Very well. My assistant will screen all correspondence - please use my professional email, not personal messaging platforms. I'll expect the preliminary documents by the 15th of next month at the latest. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a court appearance to prepare for. Good day.
[A]: Got it！📩 Will make sure everything is submitted on time~ Have a great day in court！⚖️ 我们的team will be in touch soon！🌟
[B]: 
[A]: Understood~ This has been a super productive chat！🎬 Looking forward to taking our show to the next level with your professional guidance~ 💡 Catch you later！🌟 😊
[B]:  I'll await the formal documentation through proper channels. Remember - all future communications must go through my office administrator. Goodbye now.
[A]: Roger that！📋 Will strictly follow protocol~ 我们的production coordinator会contact你的office directly！🌟 Wishing you all the best with your important work！⚖️ 👋
[B]:  My calendar is available through my assistant for scheduling purposes only. No further informal discussions will be entertained. The matter is now closed.
