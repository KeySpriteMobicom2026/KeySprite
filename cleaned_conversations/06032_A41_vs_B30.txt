[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question - though I must confess my expertise lies more in comparing Dickens' serialized novels with Qing dynasty chapter fiction than in contemporary digital phenomena. That said, the notion of decentralization does remind me of the 缘分 (yuánfèn) between reader and text in pre-modern Chinese literature...
[A]: 哇哦~没想到会在这里遇到literature expert呢！🎬 不过说到web3，这确实是个super hot的topic啊！作为一个综艺producer，我觉得这和我们的show制作也有相似之处呢~就像观众现在want more control over content一样，web3也是about giving power back to users 💡
[B]:  While I appreciate the enthusiasm, I'd caution against conflating participatory media with true literary engagement. The serialized novels of the 1800s also gave readers agency - recall how Dickens altered Great Expectations' ending due to public pressure. But was that artistic progress or mere pandering?
[A]: Haha~ 你提到的这个case真的很有意思！😂 在我们综艺industry里也经常遇到类似的dilemma呢~ audience feedback当然important，但作为creator也要保持自己的vision🌟 就像我们最近策划的一档show，既要考虑ratings，又不能compromise creative integrity 💡
[B]:  My dear colleague, if we must draw parallels, let's consider how Li Yu's 闲情偶寄 balanced commercial success with artistic merit during the Kangxi era - now there was a showman who understood that true entertainment needn't sacrifice intellectual rigor. Perhaps your producers might benefit from studying his approach?
[A]: Oh my god！你连李渔都知道？That's so impressive！🎬 其实我们team最近正好在研究traditional Chinese culture和modern entertainment的fusion呢~要不要来当我们的consultant？Your literary perspective可以给节目带来totally different dimension哦！🔥 薪酬方面我们可以negotiate~
[B]:  While I'm flattered, I must decline - unless your production involves analyzing the structural similarities between Peking opera and Victorian melodrama. My consulting fees start at three first editions of rare Ming dynasty commentaries, payable in either academic prestige or jasmine tea leaves.
[A]: Hahaha~ 你真是太hilarious了！😂 不过说真的，我们下一季的节目真的会做East meets West的theme哦！Imagine：京剧脸谱meets莎士比亚drama，绝对会是next level的cultural crossover🌟 要不要至少来参加我们的brainstorming session？我请喝最好的jasmine tea~ 💡
[B]:  Your enthusiasm is... colorful. But if you're serious about cultural crossover, let's discuss how the Yuan dynasty zaju theater adapted Persian narratives - now that was organic fusion, not mere aesthetic pastiche. Bring your team to my Thursday seminar on transcultural adaptation. The tea had better be from Fujian.
[A]: Deal！🎬 我们team一定会准时attend你的seminar~ 不过warning in advance：我们可能会用很多emoji做notes哦！😂 顺便问下，你对AR technology在传统文化展示中的应用有什么thoughts？我们正在策划一个digital+traditional的special episode呢 💡
[B]:  Good lord, must we desecrate the ghost of Su Shi with augmented reality? If you insist on technological meddling, at least study how movable type transformed classical commentary traditions first. My seminar starts promptly at 3:07 - not 3:00, not 3:15 - and emoji users sit by the drafty window.
[A]: Got it！⏰ 3:07 sharp，no emoji zone by the window~ 😂 不过seriously，你的insights真的超valuable！我已经可以envision我们节目的academic depth会提升好几个levels了🌟 到时候见咯~ 我会带上authentic福建jasmine tea的！🎬
[B]:  Very well. But should I spot a single 🎬 or 😂 during my lecture on textual transmission, I shall demonstrate how Qing dynasty scholars disciplined wayward pupils - with comparative analysis of six different commentary traditions until sunrise. Fujian tea steeps for exactly three minutes. Not two. Not four.
[A]: Hahaha~ noted！📝 (Oops... old habits die hard 😅) 不过说真的，我已经开始looking forward了！这绝对会是most unique的collaboration ever~ 到时候见啦！🌟
[B]:  That was an emoji. I've just added thirty minutes to our session - we'll begin with Zhu Xi's criticisms of improper annotation methods. Until Thursday at 3:07 and not a second later. 
[A]: (小声) Okay okay... no more emoji...  我会准时到的！福建jasmine tea和三分钟的steeping time，got it！😶 (Oops... 最后那个不算！)
[B]:  That's forty-five additional minutes now. We'll be analyzing Lin Shu's notoriously bad translations of Western literature as punishment.  And do bring an extra thermos - Fujian tea loses its nuance after the first infusion.
[A]: (完全放弃抵抗) 😭😭😭 我认输！看来在您面前我的emoji addiction是彻底没救了... 不过为了这么rare的learning opportunity，熬夜研究commentaries也值了！周四见！(这次真的没加表情符号！)
[B]:  Your repentance is... noted. Thursday at 3:07. The tea will be your redemption.
