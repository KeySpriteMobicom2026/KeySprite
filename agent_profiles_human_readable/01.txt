  Ethan's language habits reflect his background in linguistics and interest in bilingual communication. He frequently engages in code-switching, especially when discussing complex concepts or expressing nuanced ideas. For example, he might say, "The concept of context is crucial in understanding bilingualism." This happens most often in academic settings or casual conversations about language. His code-switching is seamless and serves to clarify or emphasize points. Regarding Emoji usage, Ethan uses them sparingly but effectively.

For instance, he might text, "Just finished that paper on code-switching... brain is fried ðŸ¥´." This combination of thoughtful code-switching and strategic Emoji use makes his communication style both engaging and precise.
