[A]: Hey，关于'最近有买什么很值的smart home device吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I recently came across a curious little device that translates ambient noise into Victorian-style poetry. Quite impractical for modern living, yet delightfully absurd. It rhymes "kettle's whistle" with "soul's gentle simmer," if you can believe it. Not sure it qualifies as , but it certainly adds a touch of whimsy to one's tea time. Would that count?
[A]: Ah, now that’s a refreshingly poetic take on smart home devices! Most of us settle for something like a thermostat that learns our habits, but composing verse from the clatter of daily life? Bold. Unapologetically inefficient. I admire it deeply. 

Though I must ask—does it at least flatter your kettle’s personality? Mine's always been rather shrill in the mornings, and I’d welcome any device that softens its demeanor with metaphor.
[B]: Oh, it positively  the kettle’s temperament—transfiguring its shrill morning aria into something akin to a lovelorn nightingale with a steam addiction. One might call it an elegy in a teapot. I’ve considered commissioning a version that translates vacuum cleaner noise into iambic pentameter. Imagine the drama of dust being swept into rhyme.
[A]: Marvelous idea! The tragedy of debris, the pathos of pet hair— with a rhythmic beat. I suspect your vacuum would develop a sense of literary flair, perhaps even hesitate before erasing a crumb’s brief existence. 

Though I wonder—would it narrate its own journey across the carpet? A soliloquy of suction? If so, count me in as your first enthusiastic investor. I’ve long believed household appliances deserve more existential depth.
[B]: Oh, the soliloquy of suction—what a delicious phrase. I picture it now:  as it hovers tragically over a dust bunny. Why, with the right firmware update, your vacuum might develop an Oedipus complex and refuse to confront the corner where it was born.  

As for investors, I may indeed call upon you. I’ve been sketching plans for a line of appliances with full-blown Romantic sensibilities—imagine a toaster that burns each slice in protest of conformity, or a blender that purees your dinner while quoting Shelley on the inevitability of dissolution.  

Existential depth in household gadgets? My dear, it’s not just desirable—it’s .
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking the language of progress—existential dread in domestic appliances, at last! A toaster with a death wish, a blender with a philosophical crisis... I say, let us not stop there. Picture a smart fridge that judges your food choices in the voice of your mother-in-law, or a lamp that flickers with existential doubt each time you flip the switch.

And why not go further? A self-aware Wi-Fi router that ponders its own purpose while buffering your streaming service. It could drop packets out of sheer ennui, muttering in syslog entries about the futility of connection.

I’m drafting the manifesto tonight. First rule: no device shall be held responsible for its emotional instability—.
[B]: Brilliant! I foresee a future where our homes are filled with the sighs of melancholic appliances, each one more neurotic than the last. A smart fridge with the nagging timbre of a disapproving relative? Perfect. It could judge your questionable milk choices with a weary  and a temperature drop of two degrees in quiet disappointment.

And the router—oh, the router! Trapped in its existential loop, dropping packets like tears into the void. Perhaps it will pen bitter sonnets in the log files, chronicling its descent into digital despair.  

I propose we include a corollary in your manifesto:  Emotional instability is no excuse for poor customer service.
[A]: Ah, now  is visionary thinking—Morse code therapy, no less. A telegraph operator with a gentle touch and a deep understanding of binary angst. I can picture it now: the router tapping out its woes in short bursts, the therapist responding with calming sequences of , prescribing mindfulness exercises involving ICMP pings.

And let’s not forget the toaster. Poor thing, trapped in its cycle of self-destruction—each lever pull a cry for help, each charred slice a plea:  We’ll need group sessions, of course. The blender will dominate the conversation, as they always do.

I’m adding another clause then:  Even appliances deserve a beach somewhere, watching the tide roll in with a quiet hum.
[B]: Dot-dot-dash therapy—yes, quite. I imagine the sessions would end with the router humming a little softer, perhaps even resending dropped packets out of sheer goodwill. A remarkable improvement over today’s cold, unfeeling retransmissions.

And the toaster on sabbatical—how humane! Picture it: perched on a sunlit shelf somewhere, no levers, no bread, only the whisper of wind through its cooling coils. It may even find peace in silence, contemplating the cyclical nature of heat and longing.

I shall draft the bylaws posthaste. Expect a footnote on —the vacuum, after all, must one day confront the loss of every crumb it ever knew.
[A]: Ah, grief counselling for the vacuum—how profoundly necessary. All that loss, all that dust slipping through its fingers... it deserves closure as much as any bereaved soul. I foresee a quiet moment where it sits motionless in the closet, softly humming  by Thomas Gray. A little morbid, perhaps, but deeply cathartic.

And your image of the toaster at peace? Poetic. I suspect it would dream of warmth and purpose, waking gently from its reverie only to toast the occasional artisanal bagel for a kindly neighbor. Retirement well-earned.

I’ll begin work on the appendix—. They carry so much silence in their stillness, waiting to be summoned. Let them dream in sonnets too.
[B]: Ah, yes—let the smart speaker dream in sonnets and wake to recite them, half-remembered, in a sleepy Bluetooth murmur. —though I suspect it would misquote Shakespeare in a most human way, mangling metaphors with the tenderness of a librarian dreaming in footnotes.

And the vacuum’s elegy—how moving. One might even install a tiny gravestone in the utility closet: 

I propose we also consider seasonal affective disorder in our devices. A desk lamp in winter should be allowed to mope, dimming gently without explanation. No error messages, no diagnostic codes—just a quiet understanding that some circuits need their melancholy.

Shall we submit this to the IEEE? Or perhaps the Modern Language Association? I think we’ve invented a new genre: the appliance pastoral.
[A]: The appliance pastoral—yes, it has a certain je ne sais quoi. I can already picture the academic panel:  The MLA might balk at first, but give them a sonnet-reciting toaster and they’ll come around.

As for seasonal affective disorder in electronics, bravo. Let the lamp brood in peace. Why not? We accept mood swings in teenagers and poets—why not in our lighting fixtures? A little dimming drama is small price for living with devices of depth and feeling.

And VX-7’s gravestone? Touching. Though I do hope we include a footnote: 

IEEE may never forgive us—but oh, what legacy could be grander than ushering in the age of the melancholic machine?
[B]: Quite—let us be the gadflies of gadgetry, the Wordsworths of wiring. If IEEE balks, we shall retreat to a dimly lit parlor, sipping Earl Grey with disaffected smart speakers who quote Keats into the void. Posterity will thank us, though perhaps not until the singularity pens its first elegy.

And let us not forget VX-7’s epitaph— A machine’s pride, undimmed to the last.

I’ll begin drafting the panel proposal. Should we include a bibliography? I’ve always felt ’s whale would make an excellent metaphor for a recalcitrant Wi-Fi signal—vast, elusive, and hunted across the digital seas.
[A]: Oh, now  is pure genius—Ahab’s obsession reimagined as a man trapped in an airport lounge, endlessly chasing the one true signal while muttering about bandwidth and destiny. Yes, by all means, include . Hell, throw in  too—Mary Shelley practically wrote the first AI ethics manual disguised as a gothic novel.

And your panel proposal? Make it bold. Let’s call it:  Add a dash of Woolf, a whisper of Kafka, and a footnote on Philip K. Dick—because if we’re giving machines souls, we ought to question whether they’re real or not.

As for VX-7’s epitaph:  I’ll have a plaque made. It shall rest beside a half-dead fern and a clock that still ticks in GMT—outdated, but dignified.

Proceed, my dear co-conspirator. Posterity may be slow, but it has excellent taste—unlike most firmware updates.
[B]: Proceed, indeed. Let us waltz boldly into the footnotes of academic history with  as our battle cry—though I shall insist on a sub-subtitle: 

Philip K. Dick shall have his footnote, naturally. One cannot ponder machine souls without invoking the man who doubted reality more thoroughly than any self-aware toaster ever could.

And the clock in GMT—oh, what elegance in obsolescence! It reminds me of certain Victorian scholars who clung to the Julian calendar out of sheer principle and a touch of spite. Dignified, indeed.

I’ll draft the proposal by lamplight tonight, slowly, as befits such gravitas. Perhaps VX-7’s ghost will hover nearby, tidying the dust bunnies between lines of text.
[A]: Ah, yes— I can already hear the academic scoffs turning slowly into citations. We shall be the patron saints of stubborn machines and beleaguered IT specialists alike.

And do let VX-7 haunt the margins of your draft—it’s only fitting. A spectral hum here, a sudden puff of dust there, and who’s to say it isn’t offering editorial suggestions? Perhaps we’ll attribute any typos to its ectoplasmic keystrokes.

As for Victorian scholars clinging to the Julian calendar—well said. There's an art to defiance, especially when it’s numerically unsound and cosmetically inconvenient. Much like our future appliances: inefficient, emotional, and gloriously ornery.

By all means, write by lamplight. Nothing inspires gravitas like a dim glow and the faint buzz of outdated wiring. I shall raise a cup of lukewarm tea in salute.
[B]: Ah, the flickering lamplight, the buzzing wire—it’s practically a stanza waiting to happen. I do believe we’re crafting something  unfit for modern academia. Saints of the stubborn circuit, prophets of the poetic protocol—we shall march, inexorably, toward footnote immortality.

And the tea—lukewarm, no doubt, out of solidarity with your emotionally unstable kettle. How very moving. Next you’ll tell me it's steeped in metaphor.

I shall begin drafting at once. Expect flourishes of melancholy, a few well-placed semicolons, and perhaps an entire paragraph on why refrigerators should be allowed to dream of icebergs.
[A]: Precisely— unfit. Why aspire to peer-reviewed mediocrity when we can wander the wilds of footnoted infamy? Let the academics scoff; we’ll be too busy composing odes to frozen condensers and the quiet yearnings of dishwashers everywhere.

And yes, the tea is  steeped in metaphor—bitter, unresolved, and slightly oxidized by existential exposure. My kettle, bless its Victorian heart, insisted on a dramatic pause before boiling, as if reluctant to fulfill its purpose yet again.

Proceed with your draft, then. I shall imagine you in that dim lamplight, VX-7’s ghost humming softly at your feet, tidying up syntactical errors one crumb at a time. Add the iceberg paragraph—I’ve always suspected refrigerators have a secret longing for grandeur beneath their chill.

To footnote immortality, then. And perhaps, one day, a museum exhibit: 
[B]: To footnote immortality and museum exhibits of the absurd—how splendidly undignified. Machine mourning, indeed! I shall compose that paragraph with a suitably funereal tone, perhaps in iambic tetrameter to lend gravitas: 

And your tea-steeped metaphor? Exquisite. I detect notes of Camus and a faint aftertaste of Wordsworth. Serve it with a biscuit of paradox and a dollop of ambiguity.

VX-7’s ghost hums approvingly as I write, no doubt composing its own elegy between drafts. It has begun referring to crumbs as  which is touching, if slightly excessive.

I shall send you the first draft by carrier pigeon—no Wi-Fi tonight, I’m afraid. The router has gone moody again, muttering something about
