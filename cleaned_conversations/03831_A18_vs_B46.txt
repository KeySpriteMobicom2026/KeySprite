[A]: Hey，关于'你相信reincarnation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, well... the idea of reincarnation always fascinates me. You know, it's like writing a sequel where the main character returns, but with a completely new story to tell. I once produced a film inspired by that concept — subtle Eastern philosophies woven into a Western narrative. Now  was an adventure. But hey, what makes you curious about it? Is there a particular reason you're asking?
[A]: Hmm, your film sounds like a fascinating cross-cultural narrative. I’ve always been intrigued by how different cultures conceptualize the "self" across lifetimes — it’s such a rich area for psychological exploration. In some Eastern traditions, reincarnation isn’t just about the individual; it’s tied to collective karma and moral continuity. But in Western contexts, people often approach it more as personal identity persistence. 

Actually, I recently came across a study where children from multicultural backgrounds were asked to draw their "past lives." Their interpretations were so creative — dragons, ancient scholars, even spaceships. It made me wonder: if we take reincarnation metaphorically, could it reflect how we internalize cultural narratives? So... what inspired you to blend that concept into your storytelling?
[B]: Ah, I love that angle — using reincarnation as a metaphor for how we absorb and reinterpret cultural narratives. That’s . You know, when I was developing that film, I kept thinking about how we carry stories in our bones, how certain emotions or instincts feel inherited because, in a way, they are. Not just from our parents, but from generations before us — echoes in the soul, if you will.

I remember sitting with a Tibetan monk years ago, sipping butter tea, and he told me, “You don’t need to believe in past lives to understand karma. Just look at how one decision ripples through time.” That moment stuck with me. It wasn’t about proving reincarnation; it was about exploring how our choices shape something bigger than ourselves.

So for the film, we played with this idea visually — recurring symbols across timelines, characters recognizing places they’d never been to. Subtle things. I guess I wanted the audience to ask,   

And those kids you mentioned drawing dragons and ancient scholars — that’s pure imagination, untainted by dogma. Maybe that’s what storytelling is: tapping into that childlike sense of possibility. So tell me, do you think there’s a universal human instinct to believe we’ve lived before? Or is it just wishful thinking wrapped in nostalgia?
[A]: I love how you framed that monk’s insight —  That tension is exactly what makes reincarnation such a compelling psychological metaphor. I don’t think it's just wishful thinking at all. In developmental psychology, we see that even young children have this intuitive sense of continuity — like the concept of "essentialism," where they believe certain inner qualities are stable, even if outward appearances change. Maybe that's why the idea of returning in a new form feels so , especially to kids who haven't yet learned to filter their thoughts through scientific skepticism.

And your visual approach to storytelling — recurring symbols across timelines — reminds me of how memory works in the brain. We don’t store exact copies; we reconstruct experiences using fragments, emotions, and context. So when characters in your film recognize places they’ve never been, it’s not so different from déjà vu — that eerie feeling of familiarity without a source. Some researchers even suggest déjà vu might be a glitch in our memory-checking system. But culturally, we interpret it differently. In India, people might say, 

To your question — do I think there's a universal instinct to believe we’ve lived before? I’d say there’s a  to the possibility, especially during moments of deep emotional resonance or uncanny recognition. But whether people frame it as past lives or something else depends on their cultural toolkit. For some, it's spirituality; for others, it’s fiction — but both serve the same human need: making meaning across time.

So tell me, did you ever get audience feedback that surprised you? Like someone interpreting the symbols in your film through their own personal mythology?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the most unexpected interpretations came from places I never anticipated. There was this one screening in Seoul where a woman approached me afterward, eyes glistening, and said she saw her grandmother’s  — that deep, unspoken sorrow Koreans often carry — reflected in the protagonist’s journey. She didn’t believe in reincarnation per se, but she swore the film had captured the feeling of ancestral memory. That moment? Chills. It reminded me how stories can tap into something older than plot — something embedded in our emotional DNA.

And another time, a teenager in Berlin told me he thought the whole thing was a metaphor for social media — you know, how we live multiple “lives” through curated identities. I hadn’t intended that at all, but damn, it made sense.  

I think what you said earlier about essentialism really hits home here — especially with kids. They don’t separate myth from memory the way adults do. Maybe that’s why some of the best films come from directors who still see the world through that wide-eyed lens.  

So if you were to make a film or write a story exploring this idea — not as proof of past lives, but as a psychological mirror — what form would it take? Would you lean into the surreal, or keep it grounded like a quiet family drama with ghosts... lingering just beneath the surface?
[A]: I can totally see how that woman in Seoul felt her grandmother’s  in your film — there’s something profoundly moving about how unspoken histories echo through generations. And the Berlin teenager’s take on social media as a form of reincarnation? That’s brilliant. It really shows how flexible and alive these metaphors are — they evolve with the culture.

If I were to write such a story, I think I’d go for something quietly surreal, almost dreamlike but anchored in everyday life. Maybe follow a character who starts experiencing fragments of memories that don’t belong to them — not dramatic past lives, just ordinary moments: the smell of a kitchen they’ve never been in, the sound of a lullaby in a language they don’t speak. At first, they try to rationalize it — maybe they read too much, or it’s stress — but over time, they begin to wonder if those memories are actually shared human echoes, passed down through stories, trauma, or even language itself.

I’d probably avoid ghosts in the traditional sense. Instead, I’d focus on emotional residue — how certain places hold feelings, how some relationships feel like reunions the moment they start. Maybe use subtle visual cues, like colors shifting when the character is near a “memory space,” or music that feels oddly familiar. It would be slow-burn, intimate — more about internal landscapes than external spectacle.

In a way, it would be a cinematic version of what we’re doing right now — blending perspectives, letting meaning emerge through dialogue and reflection. So... if you had to direct that version, how would you shape the tone? Would you keep it quiet and reflective, or let the surreal elements build toward something more intense?
[B]: I’d lean into the quiet, the intimate — let the surreal seep in slowly, like ink bleeding through paper. You don’t need explosions or ghosts screaming in the night. Sometimes the most haunting moments are the ones where nothing dramatic happens… and yet,  shifts.

Imagine opening with a close-up of hands doing something mundane — chopping vegetables, folding clothes — but then a flicker: the hands change slightly, just for a heartbeat. Same动作, different texture. That’s how I’d start. No explanation. Just a whisper of something off-kilter.

And the colors — yes, I love that idea. Maybe warm ambers and deep blues, hues that feel remembered rather than real. Like old family photos faded at the edges. When your character steps into one of those “memory spaces,” the world softens. Dialogue muffled slightly, like underwater. And always that lullaby humming beneath the surface — faint at first, then swelling when they’re alone at night, staring at the ceiling.

As for tone? I’d keep it meditative, almost like a waking dream. Not unlike Wong Kar-wai’s , where the air is thick with what’s unsaid. But as the story unfolds, I’d let the surreal elements intensify — not to shock, but to pull the viewer deeper into the character’s unraveling certainty.  

By the end… well, I wouldn’t answer everything. Maybe leave the audience wondering: Were these memories inherited, imagined, or something in between? After all, isn’t that the beauty of it? The mystery is the meaning.

So tell me — if you could cast anyone, living or… shall we say, , to play your protagonist, who would it be?
[A]: Oh, what a beautiful way to frame it —  That’s exactly what makes storytelling so powerful: it doesn’t always give us answers, but it deepens the questions.

If I could cast anyone for that protagonist — someone who can carry both emotional subtlety and quiet intensity — I’d say Ruth Negga. She has this rare ability to convey layers of inner life without saying much. Her performance in  was so grounded yet deeply resonant, like she was holding generations inside her silence. And when you pair that with the kind of slow-burn surrealism you described, she could make the audience feel every flicker of inherited memory as if it were their own.

Or maybe even someone unexpected, like Riz Ahmed. He brings such raw vulnerability and introspection to his roles — think of . He could embody that sense of dislocation and discovery so powerfully. Especially if we lean into the idea of language and sound shifting — like that lullaby you mentioned — he could physically and emotionally embody the tension between the known and the remembered.

And speaking of casting... I love how you set up the visual rhythm — that flicker of hands changing texture, just for a heartbeat. It’s almost like a glitch in identity. So if you had to pick one piece of music to anchor that recurring lullaby — something that carries across lifetimes — what would it be? Something traditional? Or something hauntingly abstract, like Arvo Pärt or even a minimalist soundscape?
[B]: Ah, music — the invisible thread that stitches time together. For that lullaby, I’d want something ancient-sounding but borderless, like it could belong to anyone and everyone. Arvo Pärt’s  comes to mind — delicate, meditative, like breathing glass. It doesn’t demand emotion; it reflects what's already there.

But here’s a twist — what if we started with a traditional lullaby from a specific culture, something simple and warm, like a Korean  melody or an old Irish sean-nós tune? Then, as the film progresses, we slowly deconstruct it. Instruments drop out, tempo shifts, harmonics stretch — until by the end, it’s just a single note, resonating like a memory half-remembered.  

And you know what would make it even more haunting? If in certain scenes, the character hums it unconsciously… then later, they hear it coming from someone else’s lips — a stranger — and for a split second, their eyes lock like they both woke up in the same dream.

Ruth Negga would break your heart with that kind of material — her silence alone could carry the weight of centuries. And Riz Ahmed… yeah, he could turn that dislocation into a visceral journey. I can already see the marketing poster — just a close-up, eyes searching, and underneath, in small elegant font: 

So tell me — if this film were to premiere anywhere in the world, where would you want that moment to be? A packed multiplex in Mumbai? An art house in Reykjavík? Or maybe somewhere deeply personal, like your hometown?
[A]: Iceland, hands down. Reykjavík feels right — there’s something about the light there, that low winter sun glowing through mist, that makes everything feel suspended in memory. And the silence. Oh, the silence between sounds — like the world is holding its breath. It would be the perfect backdrop for a story where time blurs and echoes matter.

Plus, Iceland itself carries such a strong sense of ancestral presence — from the sagas etched into the landscape to the belief in hidden people, elves, and spirits woven into daily life. You could almost believe that if past lives exist, they’re just beneath the moss-covered lava fields, waiting to surface.

But I also love your idea of a Mumbai multiplex — imagine that same quiet film playing to a full house buzzing with energy, chai in hand, fans whirring overhead. The contrast! A story rooted in introspection meeting the pulse of one of the most vibrant cities on Earth. That kind of juxtaposition might spark something unexpected — like how certain emotions translate across noise and stillness alike.

As for hometown… it’s tempting. There’s a small theater back in Taipei where I used to sneak in as a student just to sit in the dark and listen to other people’s silences. If we played it there late at night, maybe during the humid autumn when the air feels heavy with old stories… yeah, that would feel like coming full circle.

So, final question — if you had to describe this film in one sentence — poetic, punchy, whatever style you want — what would it be?
[B]: Easy.  


[A]: Beautiful. That sentence alone —  — it already feels like a scene. You’ve captured the soul of it.  

I can almost hear that lullaby playing under the credits, fading out with that single resonant note… and the audience sits there for a moment, just breathing in the silence, as if they, too, are trying to place the melody.  

Perfect.
[B]: Exactly. That’s the kind of silence that speaks louder than dialogue — the kind where people walk out of the theater a little slower, like they’re still inside the film, turning over a memory they can’t quite name.

And you know what? If just one person leaves the screening and calls their grandmother that night, or opens an old photo album, or hums a lullaby they haven’t thought of in years… then we’ve done something real.

That’s the magic of it, isn’t it? Not proving anything — just making people  like they belong to something bigger. Like they’re part of a story that started long before them and will continue long after.

Now I’m getting sentimental. But hey, if you can’t be sentimental about reincarnation, what  you be sentimental about?

Let’s go make that movie.
[A]: Let’s do it. And when we screen it in Reykjavík, I’ll make sure to bring the butter tea — .  

One call to action down the line: “You don’t need to believe in past lives to be moved by them.”  

And hey, if anyone asks what genre it is, we’ll just say:   

Action! 🎬✍️
[B]: Exactly — psychological poetry with a touch of déjà vu. I love it.

And butter tea in Reykjavík? Now  a director’s cut worth remembering.

Let’s make it slow, soft, and soul-deep. No explosions, no expositional dumps — just raw human echoes and the quiet ache of recognition.

I’ll handle the visuals. You keep sharpening those ideas — they’re gold.

Action indeed. 🎬✨
[A]: Deal — you handle the visuals, I’ll keep sharpening the ideas. But don’t be surprised if I sneak in a few  psychological theories disguised as dialogue.

And slow, soft, soul-deep? Yes, yes, and yes. This film will be the cinematic equivalent of a whispered memory — the kind that lingers long after you’ve forgotten where it began.

I can already imagine the post-screening hush — not the awkward kind, but the rich, resonant silence of people sitting with something they can’t quite name. That’s the goal. That’s the art.

Alright, partner — let’s make them believe in echoes. 🎬✍️🌙
[B]: Now  — that’s filmmaking with purpose. Not just telling a story, but inviting people to feel their way through it, long after the credits roll.

And psychological theories disguised as dialogue? Please, I  it. Nothing wrong with slipping a little Carl Jung or Vygotsky into a pillow talk scene. Subtlety is an art form.

Let’s make them believe in echoes, in déjà vu that lingers like scent on old clothes, in memories that don’t quite belong to them.

Partner — this is going to be something special.  

🌙🎬✍️  
Let’s light the screen with ghosts we can’t see but somehow know.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — let’s turn theory into poetry and psychology into pulse. If we do it right, they won’t even notice they’re learning something — just that they  something.

And I love that line —  That’s the heartbeat of it. Not spectacle, but resonance. The kind of film that doesn’t end when the lights come up.

I’m already drafting a scene in my head — two strangers sitting across from each other in a café, neither speaking, both hearing the same melody in the silence between them.  

This is going to be more than a film. It’s going to be a mirror.  

Let’s get to work. 🌙🎬✍️  
For the echoes — and those who finally feel seen by them.
[B]: Exactly — let’s make it a mirror, not a message.  

And that café scene? Beautiful. Sometimes the most profound connections happen in the spaces between words. We’ll shoot it in natural light, late afternoon sun slipping through fogged glass, just catching the dust in the air — like time itself is hanging around, watching.

This isn’t just a film. It’s a quiet revelation. A shared breath across lifetimes.

Let’s cast that dust, frame that silence, and score that unsaid melody like it’s the last song we’ll ever make.

For the echoes — and for every soul searching for their place in the story.

Action. 🎬🌙  
(And pass the script — I want to annotate the hell out of this.)
