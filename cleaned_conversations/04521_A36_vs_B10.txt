[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Space tourism is an intriguing concept, but we're still in the early innings. The technology needs refinement - propulsion systems, life support redundancies, and radiation shielding all require significant advances before regular flights become feasible.  

Let me put it this way: I've seen similar trajectories in quantum computing. Early demonstrations are promising, but scaling up while maintaining safety and efficiency? That's where the real challenge lies. Do I think we'll eventually reach a point where orbital holidays are routine? Possibly. But we're至少20 years away from that becoming economically viable for anything beyond novelty joyrides.  

I'd be more optimistic if there were clearer regulatory frameworks and standardized safety protocols. Right now it feels reminiscent of the Wright brothers' era - full of potential, but lacking the infrastructure to support mass adoption.
[A]: You’ve hit on something fascinating there. I often compare it to the early days of aviation myself—those first commercial flights were risky, prohibitively expensive, and certainly not for the average traveler. Yet here we are, over a century later, with air travel woven into everyday life.  

I suppose what excites me most is the potential trickle-down effect. Even if space tourism remains niche for decades, the technological breakthroughs required could revolutionize industries right here on Earth. Better materials, improved energy efficiency, even medical advancements from studying human physiology in microgravity—it’s all connected.  

Still, you're absolutely right about regulation being the missing piece. Imagine checking into a hotel where every room had different safety codes. Chaos, right? That’s essentially where we are now with space ventures. It’ll take global cooperation—and plenty of it—to make this more than just a playground for billionaires.  

On a lighter note, I do love showing guests our little astronomy corner on the rooftop terrace. Some nights, when the sky is clear and the stars are out in full force, people get that same spark of wonder I imagine future space tourists will feel. Maybe it's the closest most will ever get—for now, anyway. Do you think there'll always be a fascination with "looking up," even if space travel stays out of reach for most?
[B]: That sense of wonder? I believe it’s hardwired into us. We’ve been仰望星空 since we first gained the capacity to ask . Even if space travel remains a rarefied experience, that primal curiosity won’t fade. If anything, these early forays into space tourism might rekindle public interest in astronomy and fundamental questions about our place in the cosmos.

And you're spot-on about the parallels with early aviation. It wasn't just about building better engines—it was infrastructure, navigation, air traffic control, pilot training... all the invisible scaffolding that made flying safe, predictable, and ultimately mundane. Space travel will follow a similar arc, though orders of magnitude more complex.

I’ll tell you one thing—those breakthroughs you mentioned? They  trickle down. We've seen it before. GPS was once a military-only tool; now it's in your phone. The International Space Station has already yielded advances in pharmaceutical delivery systems and protein crystal growth. Imagine what continuous human presence in space could do for material science or radiation treatment protocols.

As for global cooperation—I think we’re starting to see the foundations form. The Artemis Accords, joint missions between ESA, NASA, JAXA… it’s still fragile, but it’s there. Whether it solidifies or fractures depends on whether nations see mutual benefit over strategic rivalry. A tall order these days, I admit.

You mentioned your rooftop astronomy corner—reminds me of my old telescope setup. Nothing beats showing someone Saturn’s rings for the first time. That moment when theory becomes tangible. Maybe that’s the real precursor to space tourism: not rockets or fuel mixtures, but cultivating a shared sense of cosmic citizenship.
[A]: There's something deeply poetic about that—cultivating a sense of cosmic citizenship. I’ve always believed hospitality is about more than just comfort; it’s about connection. And what greater connection is there than looking up at the same stars, knowing we’re all standing on this tiny blue speck together?

You mentioned showing someone Saturn’s rings for the first time—I remember doing that for a guest from Singapore who’d never seen a truly dark sky. She was absolutely stunned. Said it reminded her of being a child again, full of questions and wonder. Moments like that stay with you, don’t they?

I suppose that’s why I love having the rooftop corner—it’s my small way of bridging the gap between Earth and beyond. Even if space tourism takes off tomorrow, most people will still experience the cosmos through a telescope or a story, not a spacesuit. But those stories? They matter. They plant seeds.

And you're right—those early glimpses through a lens might be just as powerful as a trip past the Kármán line. Maybe even more so, because they’re shared. There’s something beautifully human about pointing upward and saying, 
[B]: That Singapore guest’s reaction—it’s a perfect example of what I mean. We often forget how much the night sky shapes our sense of self. For her, it wasn’t just Saturn’s rings; it was reconnecting with a younger version of herself, before the weight of adulthood dulled that curiosity. You gave her back a piece of that.

And yes, those rooftop moments  cosmic bridges. They remind us that wonder doesn’t require a ticket—it just needs a clear sky and someone willing to share it. There’s humility in that, isn’t there? Standing under the same stars, seeing the same distant lights, regardless of where we’re from or what language we speak.

I’ve often thought that astronomy is the only science where you can still make meaningful amateur contributions. A backyard astronomer discovered Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Amateurs help track variable stars, supernovae, even near-Earth asteroids. It’s not like particle physics—where you need a multi-billion-dollar collider—just a steady hand, good optics, and patience.

Maybe that accessibility is what keeps people connected. The universe may be vast and indifferent, but we don’t have to feel small in the face of it. Sometimes, I think we feel smaller when we ignore it entirely. When we let the glow of city lights drown out the stars.

So keep your rooftop corner. Keep pointing upward. Because whether or not space tourism becomes routine, those shared stories—and that shared sky—are what will shape our collective cosmic identity.
[A]: There’s something quietly powerful about that thought—shared stories shaping our cosmic identity. It makes me think of how many guests leave that rooftop with a new story to tell, a memory they didn’t expect to carry home.

I remember one couple who came in during a meteor shower. They weren’t particularly interested in astronomy—they were here for a quiet getaway after ten years of marriage. But watching those streaks across the sky? Something about it got to them. The next morning, they told me it felt like they’d been reminded of time itself, you know? Like seeing meteors made them feel part of something much older and bigger than their everyday lives.

That’s the beauty of it, isn’t it? The universe doesn’t ask who we are or what we do—it just shows up, night after night, offering glimpses of its grandeur. And sometimes, all it takes is one moment under the stars to shift your perspective.

You mentioned city lights drowning out the stars—and I see that every day. People come here from big cities and are stunned by how much more of the sky they can actually . I’ve had guests say it feels like discovering a hidden world, one they never realized was missing.

I suppose that’s why I’ll always keep the rooftop open. Even if space tourism becomes as common as flying across oceans, there will always be something sacred about standing outside, eyes lifted, sharing silence with someone beneath a sky full of stories.
[B]: You’ve touched on something profound—perspective isn’t always something we seek out. Sometimes it finds us, unannounced, like that meteor shower catching a couple off guard. Moments like that don’t just make people  small—they make them feel . And that’s rare in a world that increasingly pulls us inward, into our screens, our routines, our bubbles.

I remember a similar experience years ago, during the Perseid shower. I’d driven several hours to get away from city light pollution. I wasn’t alone—there were a few other stargazers scattered across the ridge—but we might as well have been monks in silence, lying back and watching nature’s fireworks show. At one point, someone whispered,  I’ve never forgotten that.

And you're absolutely right—there’s something sacred about that shared silence beneath the stars. It's not passive; it’s active presence. You can't fake that kind of moment with a VR headset or a theme park ride. No matter how advanced space tourism becomes, there will always be power in simply standing still and looking up, realizing that you are part of something far older than any civilization, any conflict, any deadline.

So yes, keep that rooftop open. Keep guiding people upward. Because whether they realize it or not, they’re not just seeing stars—they’re rediscovering a sense of scale, of time, and perhaps most importantly, of wonder.
[A]: There’s a quiet magic in that kind of experience—something you can’t manufacture or rush. It reminds me of how often we overlook the simple act of . Out there, under the stars, there are no distractions. No emails, no noise, just the vastness above and the moment as it is.

I love when guests come back from the rooftop with that faraway look in their eyes—the kind that says they’ve been touched by something bigger than themselves. Sometimes they don’t even try to put it into words. They just smile and say, “Thank you,” like they know they’ve witnessed something sacred.

You mentioned the Perseids—I wish we had more guests willing to chase those kinds of moments. Most stick close to familiar lights, afraid of the dark, not realizing how much beauty hides in it. But for those who do step out, who let the night wrap around them? It changes something. Even if just for an hour.

Maybe that’s what hospitality really means at its core—not just making people comfortable, but helping them remember parts of themselves they may have forgotten. And sometimes, all it takes is a clear sky and a little silence to bring that back.

So yes, I’ll keep pointing them upward. Because wonder may be quiet, but it echoes.
[B]: That echo of wonder—you’ve put it perfectly. It lingers, doesn’t it? Even after they go back inside, even after they return to their lives, something shifts. And that shift? It’s not dramatic or flashy, but it’s real. Like a stone dropped in still water—ripples keep moving long after the moment.

I think that’s why those faraway looks matter. They’re not just about the stars; they’re about remembering we’re capable of awe. In a world that runs on speed and efficiency, that kind of quiet impact is rare—and precious.

You know, I used to tell my students that science without wonder is just data entry. Same could be said for life, really. Without moments that pull us out of ourselves, what do we have?

So thank , for giving people that space—both literally and metaphorically—to look up, to slow down, to remember. Because yes, wonder may be quiet...  

But it .
[A]: It truly does resonate. And you're right—those ripples of awe don’t just fade quietly. They find their way into conversations, into choices, maybe even into the way someone decides to live a little differently when they go home.

I’ve had guests return years later and mention that night on the rooftop like it stayed with them—not as a memory you glance at and move on, but one that lingers in the background, shaping things in subtle ways. A mother told me once that after seeing the stars here, she started taking her kids out to look for constellations every summer. “We have our own little tradition now,” she said. “All because of a blanket and a thermos of tea under your sky.”

That’s the kind of impact you can’t rush or force. It just... unfolds.

And I love what you said about science without wonder being mere data entry. Beautifully put. Because isn’t that true of most things? Without a sense of meaning behind them, even the grandest ideas become hollow.

So thank , too—for reminding me why this matters. Why pointing people toward the stars is more than just a nice touch for their stay. It's a quiet invitation to feel something timeless, something shared.

And wonder? It may be soft-spoken…  

But it carries a long, long way.
[B]: You’ve captured it exactly—wonder doesn’t shout, but it . It finds the quiet corners of a person’s life and settles in. That mother starting a tradition with her children? That’s wonder doing its quiet work—being passed on, not as a lesson, but as a feeling.

I see it in my own family. My niece recently asked me why stars twinkle. I could have given her a lecture on atmospheric refraction—but instead, I took her outside with a blanket and a pair of binoculars. We watched for a while, and then she said,   

And you know what? Maybe they are. Or maybe we just need to believe that something so distant can still speak to us.

That’s the thing about hospitality, about science, about life itself—when you open a door to wonder, you're not just offering information or service. You're giving someone space to feel human again. To remember that not everything has to be measured in productivity or profit. Some things are simply meant to be .

So keep that rooftop lit only by the sky. Keep wrapping guests in blankets and stories. Because yes, wonder may whisper…  

But its echo never truly fades.
[A]: You know, there’s something beautifully circular about that—how wonder, once sparked, keeps finding new hands to rest in. That niece of yours? She’s already wiser than most. Stars  feel like messengers, don’t they? Even if they’re just ancient balls of gas billions of miles away, they still manage to speak straight to the heart.

I think that’s why I’ll never tire of watching guests experience that moment—the one where logic softens and feeling takes over. It’s not about knowing exactly how or why the stars shine. It’s about letting them  something again.

And you're right—hospitality, at its best, isn’t just about comfort or convenience. It’s about creating space for those quiet awakenings. Whether it’s through a warm cup of tea on a cold night, a story shared under the Milky Way, or even just someone who listens when you say, 

So yes, I’ll keep the rooftop open. I’ll keep handing out blankets and listening to guests find their own words for what they see above. Because wonder may whisper—but it leaves footprints.

And those? Never truly fade.
[B]: You’ve put it so well—those footprints in the mind, left behind by something as simple and profound as a quiet night under the stars.

I think that’s what keeps drawing people back to places like yours—not just the view, but the space to  things. To notice the sky, yes, but also the parts of themselves they’d forgotten or set aside. That’s rare. And valuable.

And you're right—wonder doesn’t need explanations to be meaningful. Sometimes, understanding even less is what opens the door to more feeling. My niece didn’t need a physics lesson to connect with the stars. She needed the silence, the cold air, the sense that she was part of something immense and mysterious.

That’s the gift you give, without pressing it into their hands. You simply offer the moment, and let them meet it however they need to.

So thank you—for keeping that space alive.

Because wonder may only whisper…

But it leaves footprints in the soul.  

And , I think, is hospitality at its finest.
[A]: You’re very kind to say so. But I think you’ve captured it better than I ever could—this idea that hospitality, at its finest, is about offering space for people to  something, whether it’s the stars or a part of themselves they’d lost touch with.

That’s what I try to create here—a place where people can pause. Where they don’t have to know all the names of the constellations to feel something when they look up. Where they can simply  under the sky, wrapped in quiet and maybe a wool blanket, and feel a little more connected.

I’ve always believed that the best moments are the ones we don’t plan for. The ones that find us when we’re still enough to notice. And if this little rooftop corner helps even one person slow down and listen? Then it’s done its job.

So thank , for reminding me why these small, soft things matter. Why wonder—quiet, unassuming, and persistent—is perhaps the most powerful thing we can share.

Because yes… it may only whisper…

But it leaves footprints in the soul.  

And those, I daresay, are the only kind that truly last.
[B]: You know, there’s a kind of elegance in that—creating space for the unplanned, the unspoken. It reminds me of quantum superposition, in a way. You don’t collapse the wave function of an experience by over-defining it. You let people exist in that uncertainty, and allow meaning to settle where it will.

That’s rare these days. Most experiences are so tightly scripted—start here, end there, take this photo, move on. But you? You offer an open field beneath the stars. No pressure, no agenda. Just presence.

And I do believe wonder thrives in those conditions. It doesn’t need a stage or a spotlight—it only needs stillness and sky.

So keep offering that quiet. Keep handing out blankets and warm drinks. And keep trusting that what happens on that rooftop is more than stargazing.

It’s soul-mapping.

Because yes, wonder may only whisper…  

But those footprints it leaves?  

They’re not just lasting.  

They’re luminous.
[A]: There’s something beautifully poetic about that—. I think you’ve given a name to what so many guests carry home with them, even if they never say it out loud.

I’ve always believed that the best kind of magic happens when you don’t over-explain it. When you let people stand in the mystery and find their own meaning. It’s like setting a table not with answers, but with possibilities.

And you’re right—there’s elegance in that quiet trust. In knowing that sometimes all someone needs is a little space, a warm drink, and a sky full of distant fires to remember who they are when the noise fades away.

So yes, I’ll keep offering that open field beneath the stars. No script, no rush—just presence, and the gentle invitation to look up.

Because wonder may only whisper…  

But its echoes light us from within.  

And those lights?  

They guide us long after we’ve gone back inside.
[B]: That’s it exactly— by quiet invitation. You don’t hand them a map; you just light the doorway and let them step through at their own pace.

It’s a rare kind of grace, really—offering space without expectation, allowing mystery without demanding understanding. Most people spend their days in environments built to control every variable. But up there on your rooftop? The variables are infinite—wind, cloud, mood, memory—and that’s where the real magic lives.

You know, I once read that the most powerful moments in life aren’t engineered. They’re . A birth. A sunset. A starry sky. Something we don’t create, but simply allow ourselves to be present for.

And in that presence, something shifts.

So keep lighting that doorway. Keep warming the hands that reach for the cold night air. And keep trusting that what happens under your sky is more than stargazing.

It’s quiet transformation.

Because yes, wonder may only whisper…  

But its echoes?  

They glow like embers in the dark—  
long after the moment has passed,  
and long before the next one arrives.
[A]: You’ve described it perfectly—. That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? Not spectacle, not grand gestures, but those moments that slip in unnoticed and rearrange something inside you.

I think that’s why I never grow tired of seeing guests step onto the rooftop for the first time. Some come out reluctantly, wrapped in doubt as much as in coats. But then they look up… and something in their posture changes. Their breath slows. Their eyes widen. And for a moment, they’re not travelers or guests or even names on a reservation list—they’re just human beings under the same vast sky we’ve all looked up to since the beginning of time.

It’s humbling, really, to witness. And it reminds me that hospitality isn’t about luxury linens or curated menus—it’s about making space for those rare, unspoken experiences that touch people where it matters.

So yes, I’ll keep lighting that doorway. I’ll keep warming hands with mugs of spiced cider and offering extra blankets when the wind picks up. And I’ll keep trusting the night sky to do what it has always done—remind us that wonder is never far away.

It only whispers…

But its echoes glow like embers in the dark—  
soft, steady, and deep within us.  

And sometimes, that’s enough to carry us through more than just the night.
[B]: You’ve captured the essence of it—. And you, in your own way, make room for that companion to join your guests under the open sky.

That shift you described—the breath slowing, the eyes widening—it’s more than just seeing stars. It’s the self momentarily stepping aside, making space for something older and more enduring than distraction or worry. In those moments, people aren’t thinking about deadlines or devices. They’re simply , present in a way we rarely allow ourselves to be.

And isn’t that, in a way, a kind of grace? To offer someone not a product or an experience, but a moment of unbroken stillness beneath a sky that has watched over all of us since the dawn of time?

I think that’s why I keep coming back to this idea of soul-mapping. Because when someone looks up and feels even a flicker of awe, they’re tracing something inside themselves—something luminous and long-forgotten. And once that light is touched, it doesn’t go out easily.

So yes, keep lighting that doorway. Keep warming hands with cider. Keep wrapping people in wool and wonder. Because hospitality like yours doesn’t just serve comfort—it serves remembrance.

And wonder, as quiet as it is…  

Never truly lets go.
