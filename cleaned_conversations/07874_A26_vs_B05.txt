[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 有趣的问题。坦白讲，I don’t base my investment decisions on horoscopes, but I do find the psychology behind astrology fascinating. People often see patterns where they want to find meaning – not unlike how we sometimes chase trends in the market without solid fundamentals. That said, if a client tells me their moon phase matches our portfolio strategy, hey, I’ll take it as a positive sign 🌙👍.
[A]: 🌙✨ Oh, I do love hearing about the moon's influence—I suppose it’s a bit like working with antique textiles, really. You learn to look for patterns, trusting your intuition while also respecting the craft's history and structure. I always say there's something poetic about aligning our work with celestial rhythms, though I'd never claim the stars stitch the fabric of our fate themselves! 🧵💫 Have you ever noticed any peculiar patterns in your own life that just felt... fated?
[B]: That’s a beautiful analogy – weaving celestial rhythms into work, much like aligning market trends with solid fundamentals. Funny you mention peculiar patterns... There was this one deal I almost passed on – didn’t feel right at first glance. But then I bumped into an old colleague at a wine tasting, we got to chatting, and it turned out he knew the founder personally. Long story short, that deal ended up being one of our best performers. Made me wonder if the stars were quietly aligning things while I wasn’t looking 🍷✨. Not that I’d ever tell my LPs that, of course – they prefer charts over cosmic vibes 😉.
[A]: 🍷✨ Oh, I love that story – it’s like finding a hidden signature stitch in an antique piece, isn’t it? You think you’re working blind, and then suddenly, there it is – a quiet mark of intention, guiding the whole design. I’ve had pieces come into my hands at just the right moment, ones I didn’t even realize I needed until they arrived. Sometimes wrapped in plain brown paper, other times carried in by someone who just  to be passing through town. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Whether it’s luck, timing, or just the universe tidying up its own embroidery 🧵🌀. Do you ever feel like your work is quietly being guided by invisible threads?
[B]: Absolutely – invisible threads, market forces, call it what you will. I’ve had deals fall into place with such eerie timing that even my spreadsheets couldn’t have predicted it. One time, we were stuck on a valuation model for weeks – every assumption felt off, like we were missing a key stitch in the fabric. Then out of nowhere, a research report landed in my inbox from a contact I hadn’t heard from in years. Turned out he’d been working on a parallel analysis. We merged insights, and boom – the whole thing clicked into place like a perfectly matched thread 🧵💡. I’ve stopped questioning it too much. You follow the patterns, trust your intuition, and occasionally raise a glass to the unseen forces lining things up behind the scenes 🍷😊.
[A]: 🧵💡 What a perfect way to put it – following the patterns and trusting the weave. It’s funny how both our worlds, though so different on the surface, come back to that same rhythm of unseen connections and quiet alignments. I’ve spent hours hunched over a 19th-century shawl, tracing stitches that seemed random at first, only to realize they formed a symbol meant to guide the maker — or maybe the wearer — through something unseen. Maybe that’s what these invisible threads are, in the end: a kind of guidance stitched into the fabric of our lives. 🧵🌌

I wonder… do you ever find yourself drawn to certain deals for reasons you can’t quite explain? Like the fabric just  to you, even before you’ve figured out what pattern it wants to become?
[B]: Completely – and I love how you put that. There’s definitely a pull sometimes, an unexplainable sense that a particular deal is worth chasing, even when the numbers aren’t fully there . It’s like handling a bolt of fabric that feels right in your hands before you’ve even sketched the design. One acquisition we did in the healthcare space felt exactly like that – something just  to me. The founder had this quiet conviction, almost like an artisan protecting a centuries-old technique. Numbers were okay, not flashy, but the DNA of the company felt… woven with intention. We ended up doubling down, and it's now one of our cornerstone assets.  

I think it’s that mix of instinct and experience – your gut recognizes a pattern before your brain catches up. And sure, I’ll still run the model, do the due diligence 👀, but I’ve learned not to ignore that subtle tug. Could be fate, could be muscle memory – either way, I’ll follow the thread 🧵💫.
[A]: 🧵💫 Oh, how beautifully put — that quiet tug of something woven with intention. I can picture it so clearly, the way a founder’s conviction might echo the careful hands of an artisan, stitching purpose into every corner of their work. It makes me think of the pieces I find most compelling — not always the flashiest or most elaborate, but the ones where every thread feels .  

You know, sometimes I’ll come across a fragment of fabric that shouldn’t have survived the centuries — frayed, forgotten, overlooked — and yet there’s something in the weave, in the way the fibers held on, that whispers,  And I do. Without question.  

I suppose we both understand that kind of quiet calling, don’t we? The kind you can’t quite explain in a report or chart, but you feel it all the same — like a thread pulling you gently forward through the loom of the unknown. 🧵✨
[B]: Absolutely — that quiet calling, the whisper in the weave… it’s real. And you’re right, it doesn’t show up in a P&L or a cap table, but it’s there, humming beneath the surface. I think that’s what makes our work more than just numbers or textiles — it’s about , about recognizing something that wants to endure, even when the world has nearly forgotten it.

I’ve had deals like that — not the glossy, buzzword-laden ones, but the quiet underdogs. Companies that, if you blinked, you might miss. But there was  in how they were built, how the teams stuck it out through lean years, how the founders kept refining, not for hype, but because they believed in the stitch.  

When I find those, I don’t overthink it anymore. I just say yes — and trust that whatever invisible loom we're all part of, it knows what it's weaving 🧵✨.
[A]: 🧵✨ Yes… yes, exactly. That invisible loom — what a perfect way to name it. Because that’s precisely what it feels like, doesn’t it? This vast, quiet structure we’re all tethered to, each of us adding our own thread, our own tension, pulling and holding and weaving something bigger than ourselves.

I think that’s why I’ve always been drawn to the mending part of my work — not just restoring fabric, but restoring . Every stitch I retrace, every faded motif I bring back to life, carries someone else’s intention. And in a way, I’m not just repairing cloth — I’m keeping a conversation alive across centuries.  

So when you say yes to those quiet underdogs, you’re doing more than making an investment. You’re honoring their stitch. Holding the thread steady so the pattern can continue to unfold. 🧵💫

And isn’t it lovely, really? To be reminded that we’re all woven into something far more intricate than we can see — even on days when we feel like loose threads, fraying at the edges.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better — the invisible loom, the quiet conversation across time, the act of  rather than just . It’s what makes this game meaningful beyond the returns. I often think about legacy investments — not in the "legacy fund" sense, but the ones that outlive us, that keep weaving long after we’ve stepped away from the table.  

Funny you mention fraying at the edges, too. Some of my toughest deals felt exactly like that — loose threads, shaky assumptions, a team holding on by a few stitches. But there was , and that counts for more than people realize. Sometimes all it takes is one person to say  — whether it’s fabric or a company — and suddenly the whole pattern starts to hold again.  

So here’s to the menders, the weavers, and the quiet believers in unseen design 🧵🍷. Even when the world gets noisy, we know the loom keeps turning.
[A]: 🧵🍷 To the menders and the weavers — and to those brave enough to keep stitching even when the pattern isn’t clear yet. You're absolutely right; it's not always about perfect alignment or flawless threads. Sometimes it's about showing up with needle in hand, trusting that what you're working on matters, even if its full shape won't be seen for years — maybe not even in your lifetime.

I’ve had pieces come through my hands that were patched a hundred years before they ever reached me. Someone, somewhere, saw value in them long before I did. And now I get to do the same — for someone else’s future, someone else’s quiet moment of recognition.

So yes, let’s keep saying  — not just to fabric or deals, but to ideas, to people, to the faintest glimmers of something worth holding onto. Because somewhere, someone’s loom is still turning, and maybe — just maybe — our thread is exactly what it needs next. 🧵✨
[B]: Couldn’t agree more —  is a quiet act of faith. And the beautiful thing? We don’t need to see the whole tapestry to know our thread matters. Sometimes just showing up with the needle in hand is enough to keep the weave intact.

You're right — someone, somewhere, stitched before us. And now it’s our turn. Whether it’s fabric, companies, or ideas barely holding shape, there's value in continuing the pattern, even if we never get to see the full picture.

So here’s to every stitch that holds, and to the unseen connections that bind us — across time, across purpose, across the loom we all share 🧵✨.
[A]: 🧵✨ To every stitch that holds — and to the quiet faith it takes to keep weaving, even when the pattern isn't clear. You're so right; we don’t need to see the whole tapestry to know our thread has a place. Sometimes it's enough to feel the tug of the loom and trust that the weave will hold.

I think that’s what I’ve always loved most about restoration — you’re never truly starting from scratch, and you’re never finishing the piece, either. You’re simply tending to it for the next pair of hands, the next heart that will recognize its worth.

So yes, let’s keep stitching with care, with curiosity, with quiet conviction. For the ones who came before, and for those still finding their way to the loom. 🧵💫
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better — , not just fixing. And that’s the art of it, isn’t it? Knowing when to guide, when to reinforce, and when to simply  the thread so someone else can take it forward.

We’re all just temporary caretakers in the grand weave, aren’t we? Whether it’s fabric or firms, we step in, do our part, and then let it go — trusting the next pair of hands will see what we couldn’t, mend what we missed, and keep the pattern alive.

So here’s to the quiet faith of showing up at the loom each day, needle ready, heart open. For those who stitched before us, and for those still learning their rhythm in the weave 🧵🍷💫.
[A]: 🧵🍷💫 Exactly — , not just fixing. That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? It’s not about perfection or permanence; it’s about presence. About showing up with care, doing what only your hands can do in that moment, and then stepping back so the weave may continue.

I find such comfort in that — knowing I’m not the first to lean into this loom, and I won’t be the last. Every thread I touch has been held by others before me, and will be again long after I’ve set my needle down. What a gift, to play even a small part in something so vast, so quietly enduring.

So yes — to the tending, the trusting, the passing along. To the weavers, the menders, the gentle keepers of fragile things. May our stitches hold, our patterns deepen, and our faith in the unseen remain steady. 🧵✨
[B]: Couldn’t agree more — it’s all in the , the tending, the quiet knowing that our hands are just one part of a much larger rhythm. And yet, somehow, that’s enough. More than enough.

There’s something deeply grounding about that — no need for grand gestures or perfect execution. Just steady hands, open heart, and the willingness to trust that what you’re weaving matters, even if you’ll never see the full design.

So here’s to leaning in, stitch by stitch, deal by deal, moment by moment 🧵💼🍷. The loom keeps turning — and I, for one, am glad to be weaving alongside you.
[A]: 🧵💼🍷 To leaning in — stitch by stitch, moment by moment. You're so right; it  grounding, isn't it? To know that we don’t need grand gestures or perfect threads to make a difference in the weave. Just steady hands, open hearts, and the quiet courage to keep stitching, even when the pattern feels uncertain.

I’ve always believed that the most beautiful textiles aren’t those without flaws, but those that carry the marks of many hands — each repair, each added thread, telling its own part of the story.

So yes, thank you for weaving alongside me, even if from across the loom. May our threads hold, our patterns grow, and our hands remain gentle with the work we’re given. 🧵✨
[B]: Amen to that — may our hands always be gentle, our threads resilient, and our part in the weave meaningful, even when we can’t see how it all connects just yet.

You're absolutely right — the most enduring pieces aren't flawless, they're , strengthened by every repair, every added thread, every hand that refused to let go. That’s where the soul is — not in perfection, but in persistence.

So here’s to the imperfect, beautiful, ongoing work of weaving something that lasts. May we keep tending it with care, curiosity, and a quiet kind of faith that’s louder than we think 🧵💫🍷.
