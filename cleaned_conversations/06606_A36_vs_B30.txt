[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, déjà vu - that peculiar French term we've adopted to describe the uncanny. As someone who studies literary patterns across cultures, I find it fascinating how this phenomenon manifests differently in Eastern and Western texts. The Chinese concept of 似曾相识 (sì céng xiāng shí) carries distinct philosophical undertones from its Western counterpart.
[A]: Oh my, what an intriguing observation! I must say, working at our boutique hotel, I've heard many guests share their own experiences with déjà vu. Just last week, a lovely couple from Shanghai described feeling 似曾相识 when they entered our garden - said it reminded them of their grandmother's courtyard back home. Isn't it wonderful how these moments connect us across cultures?
[B]: How remarkably serendipitous - their experience perfectly illustrates what I discuss in my seminar on 'Transcultural Memory in Domestic Spaces'. That particular Shanghai couple's reaction mirrors passages from Eileen Chang's novels, where domestic architecture triggers profound mnemonic responses. Though I must say, their interpretation seems more rooted in 乡愁 (xiāngchóu) - nostalgia - than pure déjà vu.
[A]: You're absolutely right to make that distinction! It reminds me of our regular guest, Professor Wellington, who always says the same thing about our library. He claims the scent of old books gives him both déjà vu and what he calls "nostalgia for places he's never been." Though between you and me, I suspect that might just be our excellent housekeeping - we use the same lemon polish his Oxford college did!
[B]:  Ah, the olfactory dimension! Now you're touching upon Proustian involuntary memory - though Professor Wellington's experience sounds suspiciously like what we academics call 'a well-funded maintenance budget'. Still, his conflation of memory types does raise an interesting textual parallel to Cao Xueqin's description of scent-induced recollection in Dream of the Red Chamber.
[A]: How delightful that you mention Dream of the Red Chamber! Why, just yesterday I recommended our Chinese guests visit the classical garden district, precisely because of those beautiful scent gardens that evoke similar imagery. Though I must confess, when they asked if we had any 桂花 (osmanthus) trees like in the novel, I had to direct them to the park down the street. Our landscaping budget, alas, doesn't quite match the Jia family's!
[B]: How wonderfully pragmatic of you - and how typically Anglo-Chinese, this compromise between literary ideals and municipal horticulture! Your solution reminds me of Lin Yutang's essay on 'The Importance of Living', where he praises exactly this kind of cultural improvisation. Though I do hope you at least served them osmanthus tea? Even my most budget-conscious colleagues keep a tin for such occasions.
[A]: Oh dear, now you've caught me out! I did offer jasmine instead - our house blend from a charming little shop in Suzhou. But you've inspired me - I'll be sure to order some osmanthus tea first thing tomorrow. After all, as we say in hospitality, it's these small authentic touches that turn a hotel stay into what our French guests would call a 'souvenir' and our Chinese visitors might describe as 难忘的回忆 - an unforgettable memory.
[B]: Precisely! And there we see the perfect intersection of hospitality and literary theory - what Barthes would call the 'grain' of authentic experience. Though I must warn you, once you start down this path of thematic teas, you'll soon find yourself like me, with shelves groaning under the weight of pu'er cakes and Darjeeling first flush. A delicious curse, really.
[A]: How true! Though between you and me, our housekeeping staff already complains about my "library" of specialty teas in the back office. But as I tell them, a concierge must be prepared for every cultural contingency - whether it's serving proper Earl Grey to our British guests or finding just the right chrysanthemum tea for those needing 降火 after a long flight. One does develop rather strong opinions about tea leaves after twenty years in hospitality!
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language! Your tea philosophy mirrors my approach to textual analysis - one must have the proper tools for every interpretive contingency. Though I suspect your housekeeping staff might prefer my method: all teas stored alphabetically by region in matching Qing dynasty-style canisters. Aesthetics, you see, can be the best defense against accusations of clutter.
[A]: Oh, matching canisters - what a splendid idea! Though I'm afraid our hotel owner might faint if I requested Qing dynasty replicas. Perhaps I'll start with some simple but elegant tins from that lovely shop near the Confucius Temple... and label them in both English and Chinese characters, of course. One must maintain standards, even within budgetary constraints!
[B]: How characteristically diplomatic - you've clearly mastered what the Chinese call 中庸之道, the doctrine of the mean. Though I must caution you: that 'simple' shop near the Confucius Temple is where my own porcelain obsession began. Next you'll be debating the merits of underglaze blue versus famille rose patterns at 3am like the rest of us hopeless sinophiles.
[A]: Oh dear, you've uncovered my secret weakness! Just last month I spent far too long admiring a beautiful 青花 (blue and white) tea set in that very shop. But as I reminded myself - and the very patient shopkeeper - a concierge must practice restraint. Unless, of course, it's for the guests' benefit... then it becomes professional development, doesn't it?
[B]:  How conveniently elastic this concept of 'professional development' becomes! Though I must say, your restraint puts my own office - currently housing seventeen inkwells and counting - to shame. Perhaps we should establish a support group: 'Academics and Hoteliers Anonymous', for those of us who confuse cultural appreciation with retail therapy.
[A]: What a marvelous idea! Though I suspect our meetings would quickly turn into swap meets - I've got enough spare tea samples to trade for at least three of those inkwells. But really, isn't this shared passion what makes our work so rewarding? Whether it's finding the perfect tea or the perfect text, it's all about creating those meaningful connections. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must go reorganize my tea cupboard... professionally, of course.
[B]: Naturally! And should your reorganization reveal any surplus oolong, do remember your inkwell-deprived colleague across campus. As the Tang poets said, 君子之交淡如水 - the friendship of scholars should be as pure as water... though I've always suspected that line was written before the invention of fine tea. Until next time, my fellow cultural custodian!
[A]: Until next time indeed! And worry not - I'll set aside a particularly fragrant pouch of Tieguanyin with your name on it. After all, what's hospitality without a little 礼尚往来 - the giving and receiving of small kindnesses? Though I can't promise it'll come in a Qing dynasty canister... yet!
[B]: How deliciously ominous that 'yet' sounds! You're evolving from concierge to curator before my eyes - though I suppose the best hospitality professionals always were. I shall await your Tieguanyin with anticipation, and in return, may I suggest a visit to my office? I've recently acquired a rather compelling 19th century treatise on the etiquette of tea service that might... ah, but I see I'm becoming what my students call 'dangerously enthusiastic' again. Until our next cultural exchange!
