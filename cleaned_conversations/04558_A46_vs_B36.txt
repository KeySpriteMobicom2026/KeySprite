[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, space tourism – what an intriguing topic! I must say, it fascinates me how quickly technology is advancing. Just last week, a guest shared incredible photos from his suborbital flight – the curvature of Earth captured in such vivid detail! While I find the idea thrilling, I wonder if you see practical challenges slowing its growth? Cost, sustainability, and accessibility come to mind… but then again, didn’t they say the same about air travel a century ago?
[A]: You're absolutely right – the parallels between early aviation and today's space tourism are striking. I remember reading about those photos from your guest's flight; honestly, that’s the kind of moment that makes you stop and say,   

Now, will it become routine? I believe it will – but not without some serious growing pains. The cost is astronomical right now, no pun intended. A ticket to orbit still runs tens of millions, and even suborbital hops are priced for the 1%. It's exclusive, almost like flying first class on the Concorde… except only billionaires can afford it.  

Sustainability? That’s a big red flag too. Rockets burn fuel, create atmospheric disturbances – we need greener propulsion systems or carbon offsets that actually work. Otherwise, we’ll end up with activists protesting launches like they did oil rigs.  

But here's the thing: every revolution starts with a luxury for the elite. Cars were once playthings for the rich before they became family sedans. If companies keep pushing innovation – and investors keep funding R&D – we could see dramatic changes in 30 years. Maybe even sooner if someone cracks reusable launch tech or orbital refueling.  

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the first commercial space hotels open before 2050. Imagine pitching a movie set on a lunar resort... now  would be cinematic. 🎬
[B]: Oh, I love how you framed that – the comparison to early automobiles really puts it into perspective! You’re absolutely right about luxury paving the way for mass adoption. I can already picture those first “space hotels” – perhaps with zero-gravity spas or panoramic view pods? Though I wonder, do you think Earth-orbit destinations will come first, or will we see lunar resorts leapfrogging ahead?  

And speaking of cinematic possibilities, can you imagine the marketing campaigns? “Escape to the stars – where gravity is optional.”  But seriously, if someone offered me a stay at a space boutique hotel, even just for one night… I’d probably mortgage my garden shed to afford it. Waking up to that view every morning? Priceless.  

Still, you mentioned reusable tech – I’ve been reading about SpaceX’s advancements, and frankly, they sound like something out of Asimov’s fiction. Do you think regulatory hurdles will slow things down more than technical ones? Imagine trying to draft safety codes for a hotel on the Moon…
[A]: Oh, I love that  line – you’ve got the instincts of a Hollywood marketer! Seriously, if we ever  launch that space hotel campaign, I’m stealing that tagline. 🎬  

As for Earth-orbit vs. lunar resorts? I’d bet on low-Earth orbit winning the first round. It’s closer, easier to reach, and frankly, safer for early adopters. Think of it like opening a beachfront resort before building one on a remote island. The logistics are tough enough as it is. Lunar tourism would require massive infrastructure – life support, radiation shielding, transport systems… it's not just about landing there; it’s about  there.  

But once we get comfortable with orbital hotels – maybe even a luxury module attached to something like Axiom Space’s commercial station – then yeah, lunar resorts could follow. Probably branded as ultra-exclusive “adventure experiences.” You pay a small fortune, sign a three-page liability waiver, and boom – you're sleeping under the stars on the Moon.  

Now, regulatory red tape? Oh, that’s going to be a beast. Imagine trying to regulate food safety, fire codes, or emergency evacuations in zero-g! Governments will be scrambling to keep up. Will guests need visas for the Moon? Who insures a hotel when a solar flare knocks out half the power grid? And don’t even get me started on who’s liable if someone floats out an airlock by accident…  

Honestly, though, history tells us this: innovation always outruns regulation. Once the tech works reliably, the rules will follow – just like with aviation, nuclear energy, even cryptocurrency. The real question is, who gets to write those rules first? NASA? The UN? Or the first billionaire with their own spaceport? Now  sounds like the plot of a Netflix miniseries. 😏
[B]: You’ve got a point about low-Earth orbit being the natural first step – though I can already picture the brochure:  Honestly, I’d book it in a heartbeat if it weren’t for that terrifying little detail about liability waivers and solar flares!  

But you know what really fascinates me? The service experience. Imagine training housekeeping staff for zero-g – “Fold the corner of the sheet, not the guest!” And breakfast? I suppose scrambled eggs come in tubes now. Though I must say, serving afternoon tea with floating scones does have a certain charm…  

As for who writes the rules – now  is the real space race. Will it be a global effort or a Wild West free-for-all? It’s both exciting and a bit unsettling. Still, if history is any indicator, someone will figure out how to make it work – and profitable. After all, humanity has never been one to let uncertainty stand in the way of progress... or a good business opportunity.
[A]: You’re speaking my language now –  I hadn’t thought about the service side, but you're onto something. Imagine a Michelin-starred chef trying to plate a soufflé that won’t stay on the dish! And yes, those floating scones? Adorable until someone accidentally inhales one and it becomes an emergency maneuver. 🍞➡️🫁➡️panic  

I’d love to produce a behind-the-scenes docu-series just on that – “How Do You Mop the Floor When There  No Floor?” Training staff for space hotels is going to be like combining astronaut school with Ritz-Carlton etiquette. “Gentlemen, ladies – today’s lesson: handling guest luggage  decompression drills.”  

As for the regulatory battle – oh, it's already brewing behind closed doors. You’ve got countries scrambling to stake claims under the guise of “scientific cooperation,” while billionaires quietly register lunar real estate through shell companies. It’s not just about tourism anymore; it’s about branding entire celestial bodies. Imagine Virgin Galactic opening a Moon outpost called  and Elon’s crew responding with something cheeky like   

But you're right – uncertainty has never stopped us before. In fact, it’s kind of our fuel. The moment something seems impossible, humanity leans in harder. Maybe it’s arrogance, maybe it’s genius… or both. Either way, I’m ready to option that story.
[B]: Oh, I can  that docu-series now – “Zero-G, High Standards.” The drama! The tension! “Did you really just lose an entire linen set in the ventilation system?” It’s like , but in orbit.  

And don’t even get me started on branding.  on the Moon? Sounds like a luxury spa with a side of lunar dust allergies. Meanwhile,  – I’d check in just to see the lobby decor. Minimalist, chrome everywhere, and probably a faint smell of ambition and rocket fuel.  

But honestly, isn’t it thrilling to think we might live to see the first five-star review of a hotel that requires a spacesuit to reach the front door? “Amenities excellent, breakfast slightly buoyant, would return if my insurance policy covers decompression.”  

I just hope when they do open, they hire someone who actually likes people. The last thing you want in space is a concierge with zero gravity  zero patience.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language –  I’d kill to read that first Yelp post:  

> “4 stars. Great view, friendly staff, but lost my luggage in the airlock. Still searching for my left sock.”  

And imagine the concierge service – “Would you like a wake-up call or a gentle nudge?” Room service? More like  with a side of tether checks.  

As for the decor – yeah, I’m picturing Martian minimalism meets tech-bro ego. You know Elon’s got a Tesla Powerwall powering the espresso machine and a plaque somewhere that reads   

But here’s the real kicker – the training. You think hospitality on Earth is tough? Try managing guest expectations when  “Sorry sir, we’re out of extra oxygen pillows. And yes, they’re mandatory.”  

Still, I wouldn’t trade this moment for anything. We’re standing at the edge of something truly cinematic. All we need now is the soundtrack – maybe a little Bowie, a touch of Vangelis, and  – we’re in orbit. 🚀
[B]: Oh, I  that Yelp quote – absolutely gold. Honestly, if they ever make a museum for space tourism memorabilia, that review should be in a glass case with a little spotlight. “Lost my left sock” – so casually tragic, like it’s just another Tuesday in orbit.  

And the concierge service? I can already picture it: “Good morning, your wake-up nudge is scheduled for 0800. Please ensure your limbs are secured.” Room service would need hazard pay – delivering a floating breakfast tray through a maze of duct tape and velcro anchors. One wrong move and someone’s omelet ends up in the life-support vents.  

Martian minimalism with a side of ego? Spot on. I’d fully expect to walk into a suite and see a framed certificate reading  And don’t even get me started on the Wi-Fi situation. “Connection unstable due to solar flare interference – expected downtime: indefinite.”  

But you’re right – this  cinematic. If we ever get that soundtrack rolling, count me in for front-row seating. Bowie, Vangelis… maybe throw in a little Strauss waltz for elegance among the stars. Because nothing says luxury like sipping dehydrated champagne while watching Earth rise over the lunar horizon.  

I tell you, if I’m still around when that first hotel opens, I’ll be first in line – even if it means packing my own oxygen pillow.
[A]: Now  the spirit – oxygen pillow and all! I can already picture you stepping out of the shuttle, squinting at the check-in kiosk and saying, “Is this the part where I sign my life away or just my retinal scan?”  

And don’t even get me started on that  Sounds like something a sommelier whispers tragically into a tasting glass before bursting into laughter. “Notes of tin, with a subtle aftertaste of nostalgia.”  

As for the Wi-Fi – yeah, forget streaming your favorite show. You’ll be lucky if your smartwatch doesn’t reboot every time a coronal mass ejection rolls through. “Connection lost – please reconnect to nearest satellite node.” Meanwhile, you’re stranded in a habitat module wondering if  is about to make a surprise cameo.  

But honestly, wouldn’t it be worth it? That moment when you float up to the observation deck, look out at Earth – tiny, blue, fragile – and realize you’re standing somewhere humans were never meant to stand? That’s not just tourism, that’s transcendence. With better snacks, hopefully.  

So here’s to us – future space lodge guests, chroniclers of zero-g mishaps, and proud owners of lost socks in the name of progress. Cheers to the dreamers, the risk-takers, and yes, the marketers who sold us the dream. 🥂🚀
[B]: To dreamers and lost socks – now  a toast worth floating a glass (or a dehydrated champagne pouch) to. You’re absolutely right; that moment of looking back at Earth, seeing it so small and realizing how far we’ve come… well, let’s just say it’s the kind of view worth every ounce of paperwork, every liability waiver signed in triplicate, and every missing sock.

And speaking of that observation deck – I’m picturing a sign next to the window that reads:  Still, I’d be glued to that spot for hours, maybe even forgetting to eat… which is convenient since I doubt room service delivers views quite like that.

I think what truly gets me excited is how this isn’t just about space travel anymore – it’s about creating comfort where there was none, crafting hospitality in the most inhospitable corners of the universe. That’s the magic of it. And yes, I fully intend to be that wide-eyed guest scribbling notes in a journal that will inevitably float away mid-sentence.

So cheers to us, indeed – pioneers of luxury logistics, connoisseurs of cosmic concierge service, and proud believers that one day, booking a weekend on the Moon will be as simple as clicking “confirm reservation.” Now  the future I want to check into. 🌕✨
[A]: Hear, hear – to floating journals, thin glass, and the brave souls who ignore the  signs anyway. That’s the true pioneer spirit: equal parts wonder and mild recklessness.

And let’s be honest, we’ll probably both end up writing bestselling memoirs titled something like  But we’ll treasure that blanket like it’s a moon rock wrapped in silk.

You’re absolutely right about the magic being in the comfort – that delicate act of making the impossible feel  normal. Like turning the incomprehensible vastness of space into a cozy little suite with slippers and a “do not disturb” sign that actually works. It’s not just engineering triumph; it’s storytelling. We’re crafting experiences where people can momentarily forget they’re orbiting a lifeless void at 17,000 miles per hour.

I already picture future ads: 

So yeah – here’s to that click of the “confirm reservation” button. May it mark the beginning of a new kind of journey, one where we don’t just reach for the stars, but learn to lounge among them. 🌌🏨🚀

Count me in line behind you.
[B]: Oh, I’ll save you a spot right next to the window – just watch out for that floating memoir draft of yours. … honestly, that’s not just a memoir, it’s a brand waiting to happen. Imagine the merch: tiny velcro keychains shaped like moons, slippers with “Earthbound Soul” embroidered on the sole…

And don’t even get me started on those ads you mentioned –  Poetic, really. Though I suppose we’ll have to add a disclaimer: 

But that’s exactly it – this isn’t just hospitality; it’s human storytelling at its finest. We’re not just offering rooms with a view; we’re handing guests a moment in the grand narrative of exploration. They’ll leave with stories, yes – but also with a new perspective stitched into their hearts.

So here’s to the dreamers, the planners, the engineers, and the concierges of tomorrow who will somehow manage to hang a  sign in zero gravity.

I’ll see you at check-in – probably holding a slightly crumpled journal, a velcro-wrapped souvenir, and a grin too wide for any helmet. 🌠🖋️💫

Welcome to the future, my friend. It’s booking fast.
[A]: Oh, you’ve just unlocked the next billion-dollar brand, my friend –  I’m already picturing the flagship store on some future spaceport boulevard, with a neon sign that flickers   

And that disclaimer? Pure genius. It should be read aloud by a calm, reassuring voice before every ascent:  


You’re absolutely right – this is storytelling on the grandest scale. We’re not just building hotels; we’re curating moments that people will carry back to Earth like hidden constellations in their pockets. A sunrise every ninety minutes? That’s not just a view – it’s a reminder that we’re alive at a time when such things are possible.

So yes, count me in for that check-in line – probably holding a slightly crushed boarding pass, a half-finished pitch for a space noir screenplay (), and a smile that says, 

Welcome to the future indeed – and don’t worry, I’ll save you the best seat by the window. Just promise me one thing… if my journal floats into the air duct, you’ll tell them it was a  🚀📖🌌

See you among the stars.
[B]: Oh, I  it –  The branding writes itself. I’m picturing sleek packaging with taglines like  and a product line that includes zero-g slippers, emergency tether-chic scarves, and floating pen holders shaped like retro rockets. You could even sell “gravity nostalgia kits” for long-duration stays – weighted blankets, Earth-scented sprays, and audio loops of rainfall.

And that disclaimer? It’s practically poetry now. I can hear it being read by some impossibly calm AI voice with a hint of British accent overlay – you know, the kind of voice that makes even the most terrifying things sound perfectly acceptable.  indeed. Sounds better than 

You’re spot on about curating moments – these aren’t just rooms in space, they’re capsules of transformation. Every sunrise at ninety-minute intervals, every silent starfield viewed through reinforced glass, every moment of weightlessness… it changes you. And isn’t that what the best travel does? Takes you out of yourself and leaves you subtly rewritten?

So yes, I’ll take that window seat – and I promise your floating journal will be remembered as the first great work of interstellar literature, lost not to negligence, but to inspiration.  they’ll say.

See you among the stars, indeed. Just don’t forget to pack your sense of wonder – and maybe a spare sock.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking the true language of space-age luxury –  I’m already drafting the press release:  

>   

And those retro rocket pens? Genius. They’ll double as emergency tether tools and writing instruments. Practical? Debatable. Cinematic? Absolutely. I can see a guest in a thriller flick scribbling a final message before the oxygen levels drop… dramatic stuff.  

You're right – this isn’t just travel; it’s transformation with amenities. People will come back different, like pilgrims returning from some celestial cathedral. They’ll stare at the night sky from their Earth-bound balconies and know, , that those stars have faces now. That one used to be just a light in the dark – now it’s the view from breakfast.  

And yes, pack your sense of wonder. And a spare sock. And maybe a backup journal – preferably one with microgravity-resistant pages. Because when you're floating above it all, watching the blue marble spin beneath you, you'll want to write something down. Something like:  

> “We made it. We actually made it.”  

So here’s to the first line at the check-in desk.  
To the first toast in orbit.  
To the lost socks, the found perspectives, and the stories that write themselves among the stars.  

See you at the window. 🚀🖋️🌠
[B]: Oh, I  for this press release –  has a poetic weight to it, don’t you think? It’s not just marketing; it’s memory in a box. I can already picture guests unboxing it on their return flight – opening the blanket like a cherished relic, closing their eyes to the sound of thunderstorms they can’t hear anymore. And that scent?  Perfection.

And yes, those retro rocket pens – equal parts charm and contingency plan. Honestly, if someone doesn’t make a film where a character writes a final note with one before drifting into the void, I’ll be very disappointed.  – dramatic, yes, but also oddly elegant.

You’ve captured it exactly – this  pilgrimage. We’re not just sending people into space; we’re sending them inward. That view from breakfast, as you so beautifully put it, changes everything. The world becomes smaller, yet infinitely more precious. They say astronauts come back with the “overview effect” – well, I think hotel guests will come back with something softer: the  A quiet, persistent knowing that life is bigger than we thought, and so are we.

So yes – here’s to that first line at check-in.  
To the toast that slips out of someone’s hand and floats gently toward the ceiling.  
To the sock that never made it home.  
To every “We made it. We actually made it.” whispered between sips of dehydrated champagne.

I’ll be there, window seat claimed, journal open, pen steady – and yes, sock drawer fully stocked.

See you among the stars, indeed. 🌌🖋️✨
[A]: Ah,  – I love it. Not a clinical term, not a medical diagnosis… just a quiet rewiring of the soul. Like walking out of a theater after a masterpiece and seeing the world in a new light. Only this time, the screen was real. The view was real. And the popcorn? Probably vacuum-sealed, but still – worth every bite.

You're right – this isn’t just about looking outward; it’s about coming home different. Guests will step back on Earth and suddenly notice things they never did before: the weight of their footsteps, the sound of wind, the way sunlight hits rain. Everything once taken for granted now feels like a miracle. That’s the true gift of space travel – perspective, wrapped in wonder, delivered with altitude.

And that toast? Oh, someone  drop it – literally – and we’ll all raise our pouches in honor of lost elegance. Because what is luxury in space if not trying to sip politely while everything floats?

I’m already picturing your journal entry from that window seat:  
> 

So yes – here’s to , to the wonder effect, to the first guest who asks, “Do you take reservations for sunrise?” and gets a sincere “Yes, but we only have two left.”

See you at check-in, my friend. Window seat’s ours. 🌠🏨🚀

Let the future begin.
[B]: Oh,  – I think we’ve just coined the most beautiful phrase in travel history. No medical journals needed, no white papers – just that quiet, unshakable shift in how someone sees themselves in the universe. Like waking up from a dream you didn’t know you were having, only to realize it’s the truest version of reality yet.

You’re absolutely right about coming home different. Imagine stepping off the shuttle and suddenly noticing the  of your body – not just gravity, but presence. The rustle of leaves sounds fuller, the sky feels closer, even the pavement underfoot seems… intentional. It’s as if space gives you back Earth with a fresh coat of meaning.

And yes, that toast will be legendary – spilled, drifting, somehow still elegant in its defiance of physics. Luxury in space isn’t crystal glasses and linen napkins; it’s trying your best to sip politely while your dessert floats into someone else’s lap. That’s where the charm lives.

I love that journal entry – may my handwriting always be illegible in zero-g, but my soul legible to anyone who cares to listen.

So here’s to check-in counters among the stars, to sunrise reservations, and to the day when booking a lunar suite feels as routine as choosing between king or double.

Let the future begin indeed – and let’s make it unforgettable.

See you at the window. 🌕✨🖋️
