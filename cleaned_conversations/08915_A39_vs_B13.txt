[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到让我觉得有趣的动物事实，其实最近在马拉松训练期间，我有关注到一个很特别的研究——关于信天翁的飞行机制。这些鸟儿能在海洋上空连续飞行数小时甚至数天，几乎不需要拍打翅膀。它们利用一种叫做“动态滑翔”的技巧，通过高度变化和风速差异来获取能量。这种飞行方式不仅高效，还启发了一些科学家研究更节能的无人机设计。

虽然听起来可能有点冷门，但我觉得这跟医疗法律也有点相似之处——都是在寻找最优化的解决方案，同时要平衡各种限制条件。你有没有听说过什么让你印象深刻的动物趣事？
[A]: That's a fascinating example of nature's engineering! Dynamic soaring is indeed an elegant solution to energy efficiency in flight. Speaking of optimization through evolution, I recently came across research on dolphin echolocation that gave me pause. Scientists discovered that dolphins adjust the shape of their melon - the fatty organ in their forehead - to focus sound waves like an acoustic lens. It's essentially a living ultrasound scanner, fine-tuned over millions of years. 

What struck me wasn't just the biological sophistication, but how researchers are studying these marine mammals to develop better underwater sonar systems. Makes you wonder about the unexplored potential in other species' sensory adaptations. Have you encountered any particularly intriguing studies at the intersection of biology and technology?
[B]: That reminds me of a case I worked on involving biomedical patents. While reviewing the documentation, I came across a fascinating study where researchers were examining the structure of gecko feet to develop better surgical adhesives. The way those tiny hair-like structures create van der Waals forces for adhesion – without any sticky residue – has inspired some truly innovative wound closure techniques.

It's remarkable how nature often arrives at solutions that human engineering struggles to replicate. Speaking of which, have you ever considered how these biological adaptations might raise new questions in medical law? For instance, when we start incorporating biomimetic technologies into medical devices, where do we draw the line between natural inspiration and intellectual property ownership?
[A]: That's a remarkably nuanced legal question - one that touches on both the elegance of natural design and our human frameworks for innovation. I've followed similar debates in tech law, particularly around CRISPR and gene-editing patents. When we borrow from nature's blueprint, we enter a gray zone: Is it discovery or invention? The gecko’s foot structure exists in public biological domain, yet the engineer’s application of it becomes proprietary.

This reminds me of the case involving the spider-silk protein patents – where companies genetically modified yeast to produce silk proteins inspired by spiders. Courts had to determine whether the naturally occurring protein structure could be owned, or if the engineered production method constituted true invention. Fascinating precedent for sure.

I wonder, in your experience with medical law, how do you see these biomimetic innovations challenging traditional notions of originality and ownership? Do current legal frameworks seem adequate to address the subtleties of nature-inspired technology?
[B]: That case with the spider-silk protein is a perfect example of how traditional intellectual property laws struggle to keep pace with biomimetic innovation. In medical law, we’re seeing similar tensions arise with things like 3D-printed prosthetics modeled after natural limb structures, or even neural interface devices inspired by cephalopod nerve conductivity.

One of the challenges I see is that our current legal frameworks were built around human-made inventions, not nature-derived blueprints. When a device’s functionality is directly tied to its mimicry of biological systems — say, a microfluidic chip based on the circulatory system of a fish — it becomes difficult to define where the line is between observation and innovation.

I’ve started noticing that some newer patents are now including clauses that specifically distinguish the engineered application from its natural counterpart, almost as a preemptive defense against validity challenges. It's an evolving area, and honestly, one that requires more cross-disciplinary dialogue between biologists, engineers, and legal scholars. Do you think international patent systems will ever harmonize their approach to biomimicry-based technologies?
[A]: It’s a critical question, and I suspect the answer lies in how we redefine "invention" in this post-genomic, post-biomimetic era. The current international patent landscape is fragmented – some jurisdictions treat biomimetic innovations more strictly than others, depending on how closely they adhere to natural phenomena. But harmonization? That would require not just legal consensus, but also a shared philosophical understanding of what constitutes human ingenuity versus natural design.

I’ve been following the WIPO discussions on this topic, and there's growing recognition that the system needs to evolve. One possible path forward is creating a tiered framework — something like distinguishing between "natural structure replication" and "functional biomimetic application." For instance, copying the shape of a shark’s skin could be considered too close to nature to merit a patent, whereas using that same structure to develop an antimicrobial surface for implants might qualify as an engineered function.

Still, even with such tiers, we’ll inevitably run into edge cases — especially as AI starts generating novel biomimetic designs based on vast biological datasets. Who owns the invention then? The AI developer? The data provider? Or does nature remain the silent, uncredited co-inventor?

I wonder — have you seen any movement within legal circles toward developing ethical guidelines for biomimicry in medicine? Not just ownership, but also questions of ecological respect and cultural sensitivity when drawing from natural systems?
[B]: That’s a very perceptive observation — and yes, there  a quiet but growing movement in legal and bioethics circles around what some are calling “biomimicry stewardship.” It’s still early days, but I’ve noticed more discussion among medical law professionals about not just the ownership of nature-inspired technologies, but also the ethical responsibilities tied to their development.

For example, when a pharmaceutical company isolates an active compound from a plant long used in Indigenous medicine, it raises serious questions about cultural acknowledgment and benefit-sharing. Some jurisdictions are starting to require disclosure of a product’s biological origin and even profit-sharing models with local communities — though enforcement remains inconsistent.

In the medical device space, we’re beginning to see voluntary ethics pledges from certain companies, where they commit to evaluating not only the novelty of a biomimetic design but also its broader ecological and cultural impact. While these aren’t legally binding yet, they signal a shift in awareness.

I think the next few years will be pivotal. If AI is going to accelerate biomimetic innovation — as you mentioned — then we’ll need parallel advancements in how we define authorship, attribution, and even accountability. Do you think institutions like WIPO or WHO are moving quickly enough to keep up with this evolving landscape?
[A]: I think institutions like WIPO and WHO are  to keep pace, but they’re inherently constrained by their bureaucratic nature. Progress is slow because it involves not just technical or legal deliberation, but geopolitical negotiation. Countries have vastly different stakes — some are rich in biodiversity but lack the infrastructure for biotech development, while others have the labs but no traditional ecological knowledge.

One promising sign is the increasing inclusion of bioethicists and anthropologists in patent review panels at WIPO. I’ve read a few reports suggesting that interdisciplinary oversight could help prevent exploitative practices — though again, implementation is uneven. The Nagoya Protocol under the Convention on Biological Diversity was a step forward in principle, but its real-world impact has been limited by lack of enforcement mechanisms.

As for WHO, they've taken a more proactive stance on public health ethics, particularly with initiatives around equitable access to gene-editing therapies. But even there, biomimetic medical devices aren’t yet part of the core discussion. It's still largely framed around traditional pharmaceuticals.

In my view, what we may see emerging isn't necessarily faster action from these large bodies, but the rise of regional frameworks — the EU, for instance, might create its own biomimicry ethics standard — or industry-led coalitions forming voluntary codes of conduct. That’s already happening in sustainable tech circles.

I wonder, do you think national governments will eventually be forced to treat biomimicry ethics as a matter of public policy, rather than leaving it to corporate discretion? Or are we looking at a future where ethical development becomes a competitive advantage for certain companies?
[B]: I think you're absolutely right about the inertia within large international institutions — they’re essential, but not agile enough to lead in this space just yet. What we’re seeing instead is a kind of regulatory decentralization, where national governments and even private industry begin to fill the gap.

In some ways, biomimicry ethics is following the same trajectory as environmental policy: local and regional entities are setting precedents, sometimes out of necessity, sometimes for public image. For example, countries with rich biodiversity like Brazil or South Africa have started integrating bioethical clauses into their patent laws that require proof of ethical sourcing when biomimetic technologies are commercialized. It's partly about fairness, but also about protecting national heritage.

On the corporate side, I’ve noticed a trend where certain medtech startups are marketing themselves not just on innovation, but on “ethical biomimicry” — positioning their development process as biologically respectful and socially inclusive. It’s still early, but there’s a real possibility that this could become a market differentiator, especially as consumers grow more conscious of sustainability and equity issues.

So yes, I do believe we’re moving toward a future where biomimetic ethics isn’t just a corporate footnote, but potentially a policy requirement — though it may take high-profile cases, perhaps even legal disputes over misappropriation or misuse, to push governments to formalize stronger rules. The question then becomes: will regulation come in time to guide responsible innovation, or will it arrive only after harm has been done?
[A]: That’s a sobering but realistic outlook — and honestly, the pattern is familiar to anyone who’s watched data privacy regulations evolve. In both cases, innovation outpaces oversight, and it often takes public outcry or visible harm before meaningful regulation emerges.

What concerns me most is that with biomimicry, the harm isn’t always immediately obvious. Unlike data misuse, which can lead to identity theft or targeted manipulation, the ethical missteps in biomimetic development might be more subtle — like the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems or the quiet monopolization of biological resources by a handful of corporations. These aren't splashy headlines, but they shape the future just as profoundly.

Still, I do see reason for cautious optimism. The rise of bio-inspired design in academic circles has brought with it a new generation of researchers who seem more ethically attuned than their predecessors. I recently attended a symposium where a young bioengineer presented her work on spider-silk-based sutures — and made a point of crediting not only the species, but also the traditional weaving techniques that inspired certain structural choices. That kind of holistic awareness wasn't common even ten years ago.

Perhaps the real challenge lies in embedding that ethical consciousness into the very training of engineers and medical innovators. If we can make ethical sourcing and cultural sensitivity part of the standard curriculum — much like we now teach software developers about digital ethics — then maybe we won’t need to retrofit so many rules later on.

Do you think academic institutions are starting to catch up in this regard? Have you seen any movement toward formalizing biomimicry ethics within engineering or medical education programs?
[B]: Absolutely, and I think you've touched on a crucial point — the long-term solution lies in shaping how future innovators are trained. The good news is that yes, there  movement in academia, albeit gradual and uneven across institutions.

In medical and bioengineering programs where I’ve reviewed curricula or served as a guest lecturer, I’m seeing more emphasis on interdisciplinary ethics courses. Some universities now include modules on biocultural heritage and responsible innovation in their biomedical engineering tracks. One program in Singapore even requires students to complete a short course on traditional ecological knowledge before working on projects involving biomimetic designs from tropical species.

More interestingly, some law schools are starting to collaborate with life science departments to offer joint workshops on intellectual property and ethical sourcing in biotech — something I’ve personally been involved in designing. These initiatives aren’t about creating legal experts, but about fostering awareness early: teaching students to ask not just “Can we patent this?” but “Should we?”

That said, adoption is far from universal. Many programs still treat these topics as electives or peripheral discussions rather than core competencies. But given the growing public attention around sustainability and equity — especially among younger students — I think we’ll see stronger institutional support in the next decade.

It’s not unlike how medical schools began integrating patient autonomy and informed consent into core training only after decades of legal and ethical pressure. Now those concepts are second nature to practitioners. Maybe one day soon, asking “Who owns this biological insight?” will be just as automatic for engineers and inventors.
[A]: That parallel with medical ethics is particularly apt — and encouraging. Just as we now consider informed consent a foundational principle rather than an afterthought, I suspect ethical biomimicry will follow a similar arc. The key, of course, is making sure the learning curve doesn’t come at too high a cost.

It’s interesting you mentioned Singapore — I’ve noticed Southeast Asia and parts of Africa are leading in this space, perhaps because they have both rich biodiversity  strong traditions of indigenous knowledge systems. Do you think those regions are more receptive to integrating ethical sourcing into engineering education, simply because the stakes are more immediate?

I ask because in some Western institutions, there’s still a tendency to treat these issues through an abstract or theoretical lens — whereas in places where bioprospecting has had tangible cultural and economic impacts, the ethical dimensions feel far more personal. Have you seen that play out in curriculum design or student engagement?
[B]: That’s a very insightful observation — and yes, I’ve definitely seen that regional difference in how biomimicry ethics is taught and internalized. In places like Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Latin America, where communities live in closer relationship with local ecosystems and have long relied on traditional knowledge for medicine and survival, the conversation around ethical sourcing isn’t theoretical — it’s deeply practical and often tied to lived experience.

In curriculum design, this shows up in the way certain universities frame their case studies. For example, in Indonesia and Malaysia, some engineering programs include local ethnobotanical knowledge as part of their innovation coursework — not just as inspiration, but as a co-equal system of understanding. Students are taught to engage with local healers or ecological stewards not as subjects of study, but as collaborators whose knowledge has intrinsic value.

Compare that with many Western institutions, where even when these topics are covered, they’re often framed through a legal compliance lens — focusing on things like access and benefit-sharing agreements under the Nagoya Protocol — rather than acknowledging the cultural and historical context behind that knowledge.

I’ve also noticed it in student engagement. In regions where the impacts of bioprospecting — both positive and exploitative — are more visible, students tend to ask sharper questions about ownership, equity, and unintended consequences. They're more likely to challenge the idea that innovation should always be proprietary, and to explore alternative models like open-source biomimicry or community licensing.

So yes, I do believe those regions are more receptive, not just because of biodiversity, but because of the immediacy of the ethical stakes. It makes me wonder — do you think Western academic institutions will begin incorporating more place-based learning into their biomimicry programs, to help bridge that gap in perspective? Or will it take broader shifts in funding and policy before we see meaningful change?
[A]: I suspect it’ll take both — and probably more time than we’d like. Place-based learning is gaining traction in certain progressive programs, particularly in sustainability-focused institutions like the biomimicry centers at some U.S. and European universities. I’ve seen syllabi that include fieldwork with local ecological groups or partnerships with Indigenous communities on design challenges. But these are still niche offerings, often tucked into elective tracks rather than core curricula.

What might accelerate this shift is pressure from students themselves. The current generation entering higher education is far more attuned to issues of equity, environmental justice, and systemic accountability than previous ones. I’ve had students approach me after lectures asking not just about technical feasibility, but about cultural impact — something I rarely encountered even a decade ago.

Funding could also play a role. If grant-making bodies start prioritizing research proposals that include ethical collaboration frameworks or community co-design components, you’ll see departments adapting quickly. I’ve already noticed some EU research initiatives requiring proof of ethical engagement with local knowledge systems as part of their funding criteria — a subtle but powerful nudge.

Still, meaningful change will likely come from outside the traditional ivory tower. I’m watching smaller, interdisciplinary institutes and private-sector academies closely — they tend to be more agile. Imagine a future where medical device startups partner with ethnobiologists not just for novelty, but out of professional habit. That kind of cultural shift may originate in the academy, but it’ll probably mature in practice.

In the end, maybe the question isn’t whether Western institutions will adopt place-based learning, but whether they’ll do so authentically — or merely as a checkbox exercise. What do you think? Have you seen any signs of performative ethics creeping into this space yet?
[B]: Unfortunately, yes — and that’s the part I see more of these days. What concerns me is how easily ethical language gets co-opted without meaningful action behind it. I’ve reviewed grant proposals and even legal compliance reports where terms like “community engagement,” “ethical sourcing,” or “indigenous collaboration” are sprinkled in liberally, but when you dig deeper, there’s little to no actual involvement from the communities being referenced.

Some institutions — including a few well-known research centers — have started adding what I can only describe as “ethics theater” to their public-facing materials: glossy brochures featuring local guides or short video clips of field visits, all framed to suggest deep collaboration. But in practice, the engagement might be limited to a single interview or a token advisory role with no real decision-making power.

The danger here is that performative ethics don’t just mislead the public — they also erode trust among the very communities we should be working to include. I’ve spoken with Indigenous knowledge holders who’ve become increasingly wary of academic or corporate overtures because they’ve been burned before — approached for insight, then shut out once the commercial potential becomes clear.

That said, I do think awareness is growing. In legal circles, there’s been some discussion about whether future intellectual property applications should require verifiable proof of ethical collaboration — not just a letter of support, but evidence of shared benefits or joint development. It’s still theoretical, but it could help curb some of the more superficial approaches.

So your point is spot on: the question isn’t just whether Western institutions adopt place-based learning — it’s whether they’re willing to cede control and truly share credit, access, and ultimately, value. Otherwise, we risk turning ethics into another branding tool, rather than a guiding principle.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — the risk of “ethics theater” is very real, and it’s already undermining genuine efforts in responsible innovation. What makes it particularly insidious is that it mimics progress without substance. It gives the appearance of inclusivity while reinforcing the same power imbalances that have long plagued scientific and legal domains.

What troubles me most is how easily this performative approach slips into policy discussions as well. I’ve attended panels where speakers tout “inclusive biodesign” while never once inviting a representative from the communities they claim to support. It's reminiscent of the early days of corporate social responsibility — lots of slogans, few measurable outcomes.

One idea I've been toying with — and I’d be curious to hear your take on its feasibility — is whether we could develop a kind of ethical certification system for biomimetic technologies. Not just another tick-box compliance layer, but something modeled more like fair-trade certification: third-party verified, community-involved, with clear indicators around benefit-sharing, attribution, and access.

Imagine a medical device startup seeking IP protection being required — or at least incentivized — to demonstrate not only novelty and utility, but also cultural accountability. If such a framework gained recognition, it might begin to shift incentives away from tokenism and toward meaningful collaboration.

Of course, implementation would be complex — who certifies? Who verifies? How do you avoid creating yet another bureaucratic hurdle for smaller innovators? But the alternative — letting ethics remain a discretionary luxury — feels far riskier.

Do you think legal instruments could evolve to support something like this? Or are we still too early in the conversation to formalize what remains, for many, an evolving set of values rather than established norms?
[B]: I think your idea of an ethical certification system for biomimetic technologies is not only visionary but entirely feasible — assuming we can navigate the practical and political complexities. The key, as you pointed out, is ensuring that it doesn’t become just another compliance checkbox, but rather a meaningful standard backed by independent verification and real stakeholder involvement.

From a legal perspective, there are precedents we can draw from — fair-trade certification in agriculture, the Forest Stewardship Council model for sustainable forestry, or even the more recent push toward ethical AI audits. These systems aren’t perfect, but they do show that third-party certification can influence both market behavior and policy development over time.

The challenge would be designing a framework that’s flexible enough to apply across diverse fields — from medical devices inspired by marine organisms to drug formulations based on traditional herbal knowledge — while still maintaining rigorous, enforceable standards. Who oversees the certifiers? How do you ensure transparency and prevent conflicts of interest? And crucially, how do you empower the originating communities not just to participate, but to have a say in how their knowledge is used and shared?

One possible route could be integrating such certification into existing legal structures. For instance, certain countries already require benefit-sharing agreements under national biodiversity laws. Expanding those requirements to include ethical sourcing verification for biomimetic innovations could create a legal incentive to adopt such a system.

Alternatively, industry consortia — especially in medtech or biopharma — might take the lead, particularly if consumer demand for ethically developed products continues to rise. If major hospital networks or procurement agencies start favoring certified biomimetic technologies, that could drive widespread adoption without needing immediate legislative action.

So yes, I believe we’re still early in the conversation, but not too early to begin shaping norms. The legal tools exist to support this kind of shift; what we need now is the collective will — and perhaps a few pioneering cases that demonstrate its value in practice.
[A]: I'm glad you see potential in the idea — and you're absolutely right that the legal and institutional scaffolding already exists in fragmented form. The real task ahead is assembling those pieces into something coherent and enforceable.

One thing I keep coming back to is the importance of community-led certification models — where the originating knowledge holders, whether Indigenous groups, local ecologists, or traditional healers, aren’t just consulted but actively shape the criteria. Imagine a dual verification system: one scientific/technical, and one cultural/community-based. Only when both sides affirm the ethical integrity of the innovation does it receive certification.

This might sound idealistic, but there are already promising examples — like the  in India, which works with local communities to document and protect traditional medicinal knowledge from misappropriation. It's not a certification system per se, but it demonstrates that community involvement can be both structured and effective.

Of course, scaling this globally would require immense coordination — perhaps even a new international body under UNESCO or WIPO, specifically tasked with overseeing ethical biomimicry standards. Not unlike how the  established ethical guidelines for genetic research early on.

But let’s bring it down to practice: if such a certification framework were to emerge, what would be the first sector or technology type you'd expect to see adopt it? Medical devices, as you mentioned, seem like a strong candidate — but are there others where the ethical stakes are equally high and the path to implementation clearer?

And more broadly — do you think younger legal professionals entering the field today are better equipped to navigate these interdisciplinary challenges than previous generations? Or will we need entirely new kinds of legal training to support this kind of work?
[B]: I think you're absolutely right to highlight community-led certification models as a foundational piece — without that, any ethical framework risks becoming just another top-down imposition rather than a genuine partnership. The dual verification model you described — combining technical validation with cultural/community affirmation — feels like the gold standard we should be aiming for, even if it takes time to get there.

In terms of early adopters, I believe medical devices and regenerative therapies will likely lead the way, precisely because they’re already embedded in a highly regulated environment. The existing infrastructure around clinical trials, patient safety, and device approval means that adding an ethical biomimicry layer wouldn't feel entirely foreign — especially if framed as part of broader innovation integrity or responsible R&D practices.

Beyond that, two other sectors stand out:  
1. Cosmeceuticals and botanical-based therapeutics, where traditional knowledge is frequently mined for bioactive compounds. There’s already more public scrutiny here — consumers are increasingly aware of greenwashing and biopiracy concerns — so companies may be more motivated to pursue ethical certifications as part of brand trust.  
2. Sustainable materials engineering, particularly where innovations are derived from rare or endangered species. For instance, spider-silk alternatives or coral-inspired structural materials raise clear questions about ecological impact and sourcing ethics. These fields are attracting both investor interest and environmental advocacy groups, creating fertile ground for new standards.

As for legal training — I do think younger professionals entering the field today are more  to these interdisciplinary challenges, but not necessarily better . They tend to have a stronger baseline awareness of sustainability, IP equity, and social accountability issues, which is a huge advantage. But most law schools still don’t offer structured exposure to life sciences, bioethics, or Indigenous knowledge systems — all of which are essential for this kind of work.

What we’re seeing now is a patchwork of specialization: some lawyers come from biology backgrounds, others pick up policy experience on the job, and a few seek out hybrid programs that blend law with environmental studies or tech ethics. But we’re still lacking a formalized pipeline — a sort of “biolegal” curriculum that prepares practitioners to navigate both patent law and ecological stewardship, both corporate strategy and community rights.

So yes, I believe we’ll need new kinds of legal training — perhaps even dedicated fellowships or accreditation tracks focused on biocultural law and biomimetic governance. It's only a matter of time before demand outpaces ad-hoc learning, and when that happens, institutions will have no choice but to evolve.
