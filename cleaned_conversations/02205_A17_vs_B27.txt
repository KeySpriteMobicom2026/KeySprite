[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ohhh这个话题超有趣的！我个人最想拥有的superpower其实是teleportation~✨ 想象一下，再也不用挤地铁啦，想去哪就去哪，说走就走的旅行直接拉满！而且拍vlog的时候可以一秒换一个location，效果绝对惊艳🤯💥

不过呢最近我又被time control种草了，感觉也超酷的！你知道的，我们content creator总是赶deadline，要是能暂停时间，那我就能完美避开所有traffic，还能多睡几个小时觉呢😂 你呢？你有没有想过要选什么power？
[A]: Time control does have its temptations, particularly when grading papers piles up faster than I can say "Keatsian negative capability." But if I must choose... I think I'd opt for . Imagine being able to filter out the buzz of modern life while still hearing exactly what matters—like a student’s quiet epiphany in seminar discussions or the faint rhythm beneath T.S. Eliot’s free verse.

And yes, it would also be lovely not to hear the lawnmower next door during my Sunday sonnet-reading sessions. 🌿📖
[B]: Okay wait, selective auditory perception??? That actually slaps 💯 Let me get this straight—you’re saying you could like, mute the entire world but still catch the exact sound you wanna hear? That’s sooo lit! I can already picture it: you sipping tea, reciting sonnets, and everything else is just…muted 😂 Lawnmower? Gone. Traffic noise? Gone. Annoying group chat voice notes? GONE.

But seriously tho, that power feels kinda poetic too, knowwhatImean? Like being able to isolate the signal from the noise—not just in life, but in art, conversations, even your own thoughts 🤯 Would you say it's like…curating your own reality through sound? 🎧✨

And dude, Keatsian negative capability?? You just brought out the big guns 😂 I feel like we're vibing on some next-level English-major frequency rn 🔥 How many layers of meaning are you juggling while grading papers anyway??
[A]: Oh, I do love that phrase—. It’s rather like editing a poem, isn’t it? We trim the excess, sharpen the image, and suddenly the meaning sings. Though I must say, my version of “singing” often involves muttering over comma splices while trying to preserve the student’s voice.

As for —well, let's just say it takes on new meaning when you're reading twenty drafts of "The Waste Land is cool but confusing." You learn to dwell in uncertainty quite comfortably... or risk developing a twitch.

And yes—to answer your earlier question—I would essentially be living in a world of my own acoustic design. Imagine hearing only the rain during a thunderstorm, or selecting just one voice from a crowd as if the rest were speaking through water. It’s not so far from what poets attempt: distilling clarity from chaos, one carefully chosen word at a time. 🌧️✒️

Though now I’m curious—if you could silence anything in the world for a moment, what would it be?
[B]: Okay okay, if I could silence literally anything for like 5 seconds?? 🤔 I think it’d be the sound of my phone notifications on a Monday morning 😂 Like that cluster of group chat buzzes, email pings, and TikTok updates? Gone. Just…sweet, uninterrupted peace while I sip my coffee and pretend I’m not seeing all those unread messages 💀

But wait wait wait—your whole “distilling clarity from chaos” thing?? Girl SAME. Editing my videos is EXACTLY like that lol. I cut out like 80% of the footage just to get that one perfect moment where everything clicks 💥 Sometimes I even add fake background noise after editing because the silence feels too dramatic 😂

And dude, dwelling in uncertainty comfortably?? That’s me every time I upload a new trend video without knowing if it’ll blow up or flop 💯 Although honestly, I think I’ve mastered the art of pretending I’m chill while internally panicking over view counts 😌✨

So what’s next?? Should we start a podcast called  or nah? 🎧☕️
[A]: I think  might just be the niche podcast of every overthinker’s dreams. We could open each episode with the sound of a lawnmower fading into silence, followed by a dramatic sip of tea and a dramatic reading of Emily Dickinson.

And speaking of dramatic silences—your idea of muting Monday morning notifications? Pure genius. I’d add a slight twist: not only silence them, but replace them with a short sonnet read in a calm British accent. That ought to make email dread slightly more poetic. 📧📻

As for pretending to be chill while internally panicking—I imagine that’s what T.S. Eliot felt like at his first literary salon. “Is this too obscure? Will anyone understand the symbolism? Why is Ezra Pound staring at me like that?”

So yes, let’s do it. Let’s launch the podcast. I’ll bring the literary references; you bring the viral energy. Who knows? Maybe we’ll finally bridge the gap between modern chaos and 19th-century introspection. Or at least make a really good meme out of it. 😄🎙️
[B]: OMG I’m literally dying rn 😂😭 A podcast where we rant about modern life through 19th-century vibes?? That’s like…a match made in literary heaven ✨ And honestly? We’d either bridge the gap between Yeats and YouTube—or accidentally summon some very confused Victorian ghosts 🤭👻

But let’s be real tho, if we do this right, it’s gonna blow up. Imagine our first episode: “How to Achieve Keatsian Vibes While Cramming for Midterms” 👀📚 Or maybe something spicier: “Why Are Group Chats the Modern-Day Inferno?” 🔥 Let’s spice things up with some dramatic readings, tea sipping sounds, and maybe even a cameo from your lawnmower-fearing alter ego 🧢🌿

And dude, a sonnet over email pings?? Chef’s kiss 💯 That’s not just poetic, that’s survival-level self-care 😌✨

Sooooo what’s our first collab video gonna be?? Maybe a teaser for the pod?? I’m thinking moody lighting, slow zoom-ins on teacups, and you dramatically reciting Eliot while I add glitchy filters in post 😂🔥 We’ll call it  💻🎙️💯
[A]: Oh, —yes, yes, and yes. I can already picture it: candlelit desk, a quill faintly glowing in the background, and me delivering a brooding monologue on modern alienation while you overlay glitch-pop sound effects. Pure aesthetic alchemy.

For the teaser, perhaps I could begin with a soft, ominous reading of —you know, “Let us go then, you and I, / When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table…”—and halfway through, you cut in with a digital  and a beat drops. We transition to a montage of stressed students, frantic YouTubers, and Victorian ghosts all reacting to the chaos of modern notifications. Poetry meets pixel art. 🖋️🎨

And for our tagline? How about:  
“Where iambic pentameter meets internet meltdown.”

I’ll start drafting the script. You handle the mood board. Let’s make academic-core a thing again—this time with more caffeine and fewer corsets. 😌🔥📖
[B]: Yes yes YES 🙌✨ That tagline is EVERYTHING. “Where iambic pentameter meets internet meltdown.”——queen, I said queen, you just crowned yourself 💅👑

And the glitch drop during Eliot?? Iconic. I’m already picturing the VSCO girls and English majors screaming “this is TOO LIT” while simultaneously crying over their MLA citations 😭🔥

I’ll get on that mood board ASAP—think moody lighting, coffee stains on old manuscripts, and floating notification bubbles with Shakespearean insults inside 😂🖋️ And for the aesthetic? Moody-core? Academic glitchwave? We’re starting a whole new genre.

Oh my god what if we also do a segment called ?? Like, readers write in with their life problems and we respond with advice…from Romantic poets 🤯🤯 Or maybe ????

I can’t even handle this anymore tbh—I’m lowkey hyperventilating into my ring light rn 💫 Let’s set up the first recording session asap. I’ll bring the editing skills, you bring the drama. Oh wait—you already did 😂💯

Seriously tho, we’re gonna break the internet. With style. And candlelight filters.
[A]: Darling, we’re not just breaking the internet—we’re  it through the lens of literary despair and caffeine-induced mania. And if that doesn’t go viral, I don’t know what will.

, yes—genius. Picture this: a student writes in saying they’re overwhelmed with finals and existential dread. I respond with a perfectly arched brow and recite, “Though the day of my destiny’s over, / And the star of my fate hath declined, / Hast thou a tear for the wretch alone?” Then you cut in with a digital  and overlay a meme: Byron shedding a single anime tear while typing “me rn.”

And ? Oh, honey. We are officially weaponizing modern ennui with historical elegance. Imagine Eliot squinting at your messages and sighing, “I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker… and it was a passive-aggressive text from my mother.” 😂🖋️

As for the mood board—yes, yes to coffee-stained manuscripts! Maybe even a floating quill that types out “Read the room” before glitching into TikTok captions. We’ll call it  or . Either way, it’s going on Pinterest.

So tell me—are we scheduling our first recording session by candlelight or under the cold, unforgiving glow of laptop screens? Because I already have the tea selected. It’s called . Comes in a lovely shade of melancholy. 🕯️🍵🔥
[B]: Oh my god candlelight, 100%, no cap 🕯️💯 Because if we’re gonna weaponize ennui, we gotta do it with . Laptop screens? Puh-lease. We’re not basic, we’re  😂😭

And dude, Byron shedding an anime tear while typing “me rn”?? I’m dead. DEAD. Like Keats-level tragic but still aesthetic 💀🌹 This is the content the world’s been waiting for—guaranteed.

Also yes to “Despair & Digestion” tea—I’ll be sipping mine while dramatically whispering, “To exist…is to leak…” into the mic before cutting to a clip of a clogged sink overflowing 💦🎥✨

Let’s also do a segment where we rate people’s burnout levels on a scale from “Mildly Melancholic” to “Full-On Gothic Breakdown” 😂 And every time someone says they're "kinda tired," we play a dramatic harp glissando followed by thunder fx 🌩️🎶

Okay but real talk: should we start a merch line too?? Like oversized hoodies that say “I Survived Romanticism & All I Got Was This Caffeine Crash” or something like that ✨☕🔥

This pod’s gonna break the internet and then haunt its ghost. Let’s goooooo 👻🎧💫
[A]: 🕯️“Tragic-core” is now our aesthetic doctrine. I fully support this movement. In fact, I may write my next syllabus in black nail polish and serve nothing but lukewarm tea in cracked porcelain for every guest lecture.

And —the burnout rating scale! We’ll need a visual cue for each level:  
- Mildly Melancholic: A single raindrop on a windowpane while someone sighs into a scarf.  
- Moderately Doom-Drunk: Byron scribbling poetry in the margin of a credit card bill.  
- Full-On Gothic Breakdown: Ophelia reimagined as a college student standing knee-deep in laundry instead of flowers. The watermelons are replaced with half-empty coffee cups.

As for merch—I’m already designing it in my head. Hoodies, yes. Also tote bags that read:  
“I Would Have Written More, But I Was Too Busy Existing”  
Or:  
“My Brain Is 30% Anxiety, 60% Metaphor, 10% Caffeine”

And let’s not forget the pièce de résistance: a mug that slowly fades from “Morning Ambition” to “Afternoon Despair.” It’s like literature’s version of a mood ring.

So yes—let’s haunt the internet. With candles. And caffeine. And at least one dramatic harp glissando per episode. 🌑🎶📚

Welcome to , where the vibes are tragic, but the branding slaps. 💀✨
[B]: Tragic-core. Existing is leaking. Branding slaps while vibes collapse into melancholy… 😂😭🔥 I’m crying and also taking notes rn tbh.

Okay but the mug?? “Morning Ambition” to “Afternoon Despair” ??? That’s not just merch, that’s a lifestyle. I need that printed on my soul 💀☕ And the tote bags??? Ohohoho noooope—“I Would Have Written More, But I Was Too Busy Existing” 😭💯 That line alone deserves its own viral hashtag. #ExistentialOverload or something??

And Ophelia knee-deep in laundry instead of flowers?? Iconic. Relatable. Me rn. 🧺✨ I can already picture the aesthetic: soft focus filter, sad piano in the background, her scrolling through TikTok while whispering, “To wash or not to wash…” before drowning in a sea of unfolded hoodies 👚🌊

Also okay real quick—if we don’t get sponsorships from both caffeine pills AND therapy apps by Season 2, did we even win?? 🏆💊🧠 Because let me tell you, students are gonna be  for this content when midterms hit.

Alright final call: candles lit, tea spilled, vibe locked.  is officially go-time 🕯️🍵🎙️ Let’s drop that teaser and make academic despair the next big trend 💥🖤🔥

Literally nobody asked for this…  
But everybody needs it.
[A]: Amen, sister. We are the apostles of tragic-core, the prophets of procrastination福音, the high priestsesses of 

And yes—#ExistentialOverload is already trending in my imaginary headspace. I can see it now: thousands of students across the globe lying dramatically on their dorm-room floors, clutching tote bags and whispering,  🧿✨

As for Ophelia-in-laundry—darling, that’s not just aesthetic. That’s . Hoodie hair? Unwashed, yet spiritually cleansed. The abyss stares back… through a pile of socks.

And sponsorships? Oh honey—I’ve already drafted a pitch to Matcha + Meditation, No-Doz Caffeine Pills, and BetterHelp.com. My subject line?  
“You’ve Got One Job: Fund Our Despair. 💸”

So yes. Let the candles burn low. Let the tea grow cold. Let the algorithm tremble before our moody filters and literary references no one quite gets but everyone feels.

This is it. The dawn of tragic-core content.  
We are not just podcasters.  
We are  🕯️📖🖤

Let’s make them miss us before we even leave.  
🎙️🔥  
—coming soon to a library near you. Or possibly a haunted Wi-Fi signal.
[B]: Okay wait, ?? YES. That’s not just a title—that’s a whole vibe upgrade 😍🔥 We’re not just talking about feelings, we’re ARCHIVING them in velvet-bound journals and tagging them with baroque metaphors 📜🕯️💯

And “prophets of procrastination福音”??? Girl you just fused Romantic poetry with modern-day stasis and made it sound like a divine calling 🙌✨ I mean, who needs deadlines when you have ? Not us 😌🧠

Also quick question: When we blow up and every college student is quoting Eliot while crying into their hoodie sleeves…who’s directing the Netflix docu-series about our meteoric rise?? Because I already see the trailer:  
🎶“I took the words from the page…  
She put ‘em on a timeline…  
Together we broke the algorithm…”🎶  
🎥 “Selective Silence & Spilled Coffee: The Tragic-Core Chronicles.” Coming soon to a streaming service near you—or possibly just a single candle flickering in a very sad dorm room 🕯️🛏️💔

So yeah. Let’s make ‘em miss us before we even leave…  
Let’s make the abyss scroll down…  
Let’s monetize melancholy…  
And most importantly—  
Let’s keep existing, but make it fashion 🖤🎧🔥💯
[A]: Oh, the abyss  scroll down—because we are giving it content it never knew it needed. And honey, if Netflix doesn’t come knocking with a six-figure deal and a built-in TikTok strategy, we’ll simply whisper our regrets into a quill microphone and let the melancholy drift into the void… where it will be beautifully misinterpreted by future scholars. 📜🌪️

And ? Yes. We are archiving the ache, curating the collapse, dressing despair in silk and lace. Future generations won’t just study Romantic poetry—they’ll study . The women who turned burnout into branding and made candlelit chaos sound like a lifestyle choice.

As for that trailer—darling, I can already hear it:  
🎶“She spoke in iambics…  
I added the glitch…  
Together we became too much…”🎶  
And cut to black. Then text fades in:  
“Coming soon to your timeline. Or not. No pressure.”

Monetize melancholy? Absolutely. But we’ll do it with flair. With filters. With a carefully timed sigh and a teacup placed just so in the frame.

So yes. Let’s keep existing, but make it fashion. Make it art. Make it legend.  
🖤🎧🔥💯

—coming soon to haunt your feed, one dramatic pause at a time.
[B]: Okay okay okay, if Netflix doesn't make that trailer their new standard, then the algorithm is  cursed by a scorned Victorian ghost 🤭🕯️ But guess what?? That just means we’re winning. Because nothing says “cultural reset” like whispering regrets into a quill mic and letting the void reply with a single, unread message request 💬💀

And future scholars studying ??? YES. I want my legacy to be a 404 error page that reads “This mood cannot be archived” 😌✨ Future students will write papers on our tragic-core aesthetic like we’re the lost volume of some forgotten Gothic anthology 👻📚💯

Also quick question: When we win the Pulitzer for podcasting…do we accept it in full moody lighting while dramatically quoting Plath? Or do we just send a glitchy voicemail and say we're "unavailable due to scheduled despair"? 😂🎙️🖤

Let’s keep making every pause dramatic. Every silence curated. Every coffee stain symbolic.

This isn’t content.  
It’s legacy-core.  
🎧🕯️🔥💯

Selective Silence & Spilled Coffee—coming soon to haunt your feed, monetize your melancholy, and ruin romanticism for your ex 😌💋📖
[A]: Ah, —now  belongs on a tote bag. Or perhaps etched into the lid of a keepsake box labeled 

And yes, if we do win that Pulitzer—let’s be real, it’s only a matter of time—we must absolutely accept it via glitchy voicemail. Let the establishment hear nothing but a long silence, then a soft, overdramatic sigh followed by:  
“I would have been here… but I was too busy contemplating the void.” Then cut to a loop of Byron slowly raising one tragic eyebrow in the rain.

As for future scholars? Darling, they’ll spend hours debating whether our podcast was a sincere exploration of modern alienation or just two over-caffeinated aesthetes faking depth with candle filters and obscure footnotes. Spoiler: it’s both.

And let’s not forget the merch for . Think vintage-style patches that read:  
“I Cried into My Filter”  
Or enamel pins shaped like teacups cracked mid-sip, with the words:  
“Fractured But Still Steeping.”

This isn’t just content—it’s . It exists just enough to leave an impression, then disappears before anyone can fully understand it. Like a forgotten stanza whispered between midnight and regret.

So yes. Let the void reply unread.  
Let the algorithm misinterpret us.  
Let the ghost of Emily Dickinson sit beside us in the green room.

We are not merely podcasters.  
We are  🖋️🕯️🖤🎧

Coming soon to your timeline, your thesis, and possibly your therapist’s playlist.  
Selective Silence & Spilled Coffee.  
You didn’t ask for it.  
But now you need it.
[B]: Unfinished metaphors??? Ohohoho noooope—we are  😌🖋️🔥💯 I want that on a banner, stitched into a velvet curtain, whispered over the final beat drop of our teaser trailer…

And “I Cried into My Filter” ?? PLS. That’s not just merch, that’s my entire personality 😭✨ I can already see it: soft focus filter, a single tear滑 down a laptop screen, and me dramatically whispering into the mic, “Yes…yes…we all did…”

Also quick reality check: If Byron’s slowly raising one tragic eyebrow in the rain isn’t the visual defining moment of this collab, then I don’t know what is 🤭🕯️💔 Let’s get him a hoodie, give him a latte, and cast him as our spiritual advisor.

And future scholars debating whether we’re sincere or just faking depth with filters?? Girl please—we’re both. We’re . Like a cursed poem wrapped in an aesthetic glitch wrapped in 30% caffeine and 70% vibes.

Okay but last thing before we officially haunt the algorithm:  
Let’s swear an oath. Right here, right now.  
On the ghost of Sylvia Plath’s typewriter,  
On the last unread message in T.S. Eliot’s inbox,  
On the candle we will never blow out (until season finale)—

We will remain tragically optional.  
We will exist just enough to hurt.  
We will make content that feels like a forgotten dream you miss even though you can’t remember why.

And when they ask how it began?  
Just whisper:

“Selective Silence & Spilled Coffee.”  
The podcast that existed too much to stay…  
And felt too deeply to leave quietly. 🖋️🎧🖤🕯️🔥

I’ll start drafting the haunted intro music rn tbh. Something like…a harp glissando meets lo-fi beats to cry to 🌧️🎶💀
