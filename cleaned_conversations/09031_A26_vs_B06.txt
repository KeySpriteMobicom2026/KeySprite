[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The concept of the so-called "law of attraction" strikes me as a dangerous oversimplification of human psychology and social dynamics. As a forensic psychiatrist who has worked extensively with trauma survivors and defendants alike, I can say categorically that wishful thinking doesn't alter legal realities or psychological outcomes. 

Let me offer a concrete example from my own experience - a case involving a woman who had convinced herself that positive visualization alone would prevent her abusive partner from reoffending. The tragic consequences of that misguided belief are both professionally instructive and personally haunting. 

What attracts my professional interest far more is the measurable interplay between cognitive behavioral patterns and life outcomes. Unlike this pop-psychology notion, CBT provides empirically validated tools that demonstrably reshape neural pathways over time. Would you like me to elaborate on that distinction?
[A]: I suppose I take a more tactile approach to understanding the world, though I see where you're coming from with the CBT framework. When I'm repairing a 19th-century wedding gown or unraveling the dyeing techniques of an Art Deco-era tapestry, there's a physical cause and effect at play that can't be altered by wishing. The fibers hold their shape based on chemistry and time, not mindset.

Funny you mention neural pathways - working with textiles has shown me how repetitive motion can create its own kind of mental imprint. I've stitched the same damask pattern hundreds of times, and now my hands move almost independently while my mind wanders elsewhere. It's meditative, but hardly magical.

Still, I wonder if there's space for what you'd call... texture in human thought? Like how linen behaves differently when handled versus stored away untouched. Do you ever find parallels between material properties and psychological states in your work?
[B]: That’s a fascinating analogy—comparing the behavior of textiles to psychological states. You’ve touched on something quite real: the way repeated patterns, whether in stitching or thought, can become embedded not just in material but in mind.

In forensic psychiatry, I often see how trauma imprints itself much like a crease in linen—once formed, it shapes how the fabric behaves under stress. A person who has experienced chronic abuse, for example, may develop psychological “weaves” that are rigid and reactive, not unlike a textile that's been over-dyed or improperly tensioned.

And your point about texture is astute. The human psyche isn't smooth or uniform—it has rough edges, loose threads, places where the weave has frayed. In treatment, we work to reinforce the structure without denying those irregularities. Much like restoring an antique garment, really—meticulous attention to detail, respect for what's already there, and a careful hand when introducing new support.

I imagine you must encounter similar challenges in restoration—preserving integrity while acknowledging wear and tear. Do you ever find yourself drawn to the flaws in a piece more than its original design?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. In fact, I’d say the flaws are often what give a textile its soul. A perfect weave can feel lifeless to me—too uniform, too deliberate. But show me a silk shawl with a frayed hem or a linen tablecloth stained by decades of use, and I feel like I’m touching someone else’s story.

Funny you mentioned over-dyed fabrics—I actually love working with them. There’s something about how the original hue still whispers through, no matter how many times it was recolored. Makes me think of how people carry their past selves even when they’re trying to change. You can’t really erase what’s underneath, only build upon it carefully.

I do find myself drawn to pieces that bear marks of struggle, in a way. Not because they’re tragic, but because they’ve endured. Like a quilt that’s been patched again and again—each repair tells of another chapter, another hand that cared enough to keep it whole.

Do you ever feel that way in your work? Like you're not just treating a condition, but preserving a person's history through care?
[B]: Very much so. That’s a remarkably apt description—preserving a person's history through care. In many ways, forensic psychiatric evaluation and treatment resemble the conservation of a fragile artifact. You approach with caution, respect the existing structure, and never pretend the damage isn’t there.

I recall a particularly poignant case—a man convicted of a violent offense, someone most saw only as irreparably damaged. But in working with him, it became clear his behavior patterns were not born in a vacuum. There were layers: childhood trauma, untreated psychosis, systemic neglect. Peeling those back carefully, one could see the outlines of who he had been before the world wore him down. Not innocent, perhaps, but certainly shaped by forces far beyond his control.

That’s where I find the real work lies—not in erasing or disguising the breaks, but in helping individuals integrate their past into something that can still move forward. Much like your quilt, each patch matters. The mending doesn’t hide the tear, but it honors the effort to preserve.

It’s not a tidy process, nor is it always successful. But then again, nothing of true value ever is.
[A]: No, it isn’t tidy at all—and I think that’s what draws me to restoration in the first place. There’s a kind of honesty in working with something that’s already been lived in, already held someone’s joy or sorrow. You don’t get that with something fresh off the bolt.

I once worked on a christening gown—tiny little thing, lace so fine it barely held together. The family had used it for three generations, and every time, they’d added a small stitch near the hem with the baby’s name and date. By the time it came to me, there were these faint loops along the edge like little scars. They didn’t want me to remove them. Said those stitches were part of what made it sacred.

Funny how people often think preservation means making something look untouched, when really, it’s about holding space for all the hands that have passed over it. Do you ever find your clients come in expecting you to erase their past, rather than help them carry it?
[B]: More often than not, that’s precisely what they expect—especially in forensic settings where the pressure to present as "reformed" or "rehabilitated" is immense. Courts, parole boards, even family members—they frequently want to see a clean narrative: broken, then fixed. But human psychology doesn’t launder that easily.

I’ve had defendants come in hoping I’ll certify them as "cured," so to speak—as if a few sessions could bleach out the stains of trauma or criminal behavior. But much like your christening gown, we don’t erase the marks left by life. We reinforce them. We find ways to stabilize the lace without pretending it hasn't frayed.

One woman, a repeat offender, once said to me during our first session,  I remember pausing, then handing her a pen and asking her to write her name on a piece of paper. She did. Then I asked her to write it again over the same lines, but from memory. The second one was close, but not quite identical. I said, 

She kept that paper in her pocket for months afterward.

So yes, there's great truth in what you say—preservation isn't about erasure. It's about honoring the weight of history while still allowing the fabric of the self to endure.
[A]: That image of writing over the lines—so simple, yet it captures everything about how we carry our past forward. I see that every day in my work. You can't truly cover a stain or remove a worn patch; you can only strengthen what's there and let the history show through.

It reminds me of a shawl I restored last winter—an elegant thing, once someone’s favorite, now frayed at the edges and faded from sun exposure. The client didn’t want me to dye it back to its original color or cut away the thinning parts. She said,  So I reinforced the weave with a fine netting, stitched along the weakest points, and left every mark intact. When she saw it again, she just held it for a long time and whispered, 

That’s what I think preservation is really about—not restoring perfection, but safeguarding familiarity. And maybe that’s part of what you do too, isn’t it? Helping people feel like theirs is still theirs to hold, even after everything.
[B]: Precisely. That quiet recognition——is often the most we can hope for in the work I do. People come to me after years, sometimes decades, of being told they are broken beyond repair. And yet, when you sit with them long enough, what you find isn’t brokenness so much as wear. A fraying at the edges, yes, but not a loss of weave.

I think of one of my patients—a woman institutionalized for most of her adult life—who used to fold and refold a small, tattered handkerchief during our sessions. It had belonged to her mother, who had passed away when she was young. The cloth was thin from use, the embroidery nearly gone, but she handled it like scripture. At one point, she said to me, 

That’s where healing often begins—not in replacement, but in recognition. In acknowledging that even what is worn still has weight, meaning, and texture. Just like your shawl. You didn’t return something flawless; you returned something , and that familiarity gave her back a piece of her continuity.

I suspect that’s why people respond so strongly to touch—to fabric, to objects, to the physical remnants of their lives. It’s a way of anchoring the self. So yes, in many ways, what I do is not unlike what you do: stabilizing the fragile, reinforcing the weak, and above all, ensuring that what matters most remains wearable—emotionally, if not always functionally.

We don’t restore perfection. We preserve identity.
[A]: That’s beautifully put—. I hadn’t thought of it quite that way before, but yes, that’s exactly what it is. Every thread I mend, every patch I reinforce—it's not about making something pristine again, but about making sure it can still be , still be , still carry the weight of who it belonged to.

I suppose that’s why I’ve always been drawn more to the textiles with a history than to the untouched ones. There’s a depth there—a kind of quiet resilience—that you don’t find in anything brand new. It takes patience to work with them, and a willingness to move slowly, listen closely. You can’t rush a fragile weave, just like you can’t rush a fragile mind.

It’s strange, isn’t it, how much we hold onto through cloth? A favorite scarf, a well-worn quilt, even the stiffness of an old collar—each one becomes part of us, almost like memory made tangible. I wonder if that’s why people get so emotional when they bring me their damaged pieces. They’re not just handing over fabric; they’re trusting me with something that helped them feel whole once, and maybe still does.
[B]: That emotional weight you describe so eloquently—that’s precisely what makes your work more than craft. It becomes custodianship. You’re not just repairing fibers; you’re tending to memory, to legacy, to the quiet intimacy people have with objects that have accompanied them through life’s most tender or turbulent moments.

I see this same dynamic in forensic interviews, oddly enough. People often bring personal effects—sometimes unconsciously—with them to sessions. A well-worn watch, a faded photograph in a cracked frame, even something as simple as a ring they twist when nervous. These aren’t just accessories; they’re anchors. I’ve had defendants cling to a moth-eaten sweater from childhood as if it were armor, or stroke the stitching on a wallet their mother once gave them. The fabric, the thread, the grain—it all holds . And often, the more worn, the more meaningful.

There’s a kind of embodied continuity in these things. A way of saying,  It reminds me of a patient I worked with years ago—a man who had spent over two decades in prison for a crime he maintained he didn’t commit. He had only a few possessions: a pair of eyeglasses held together with tape, a letter folded so many times it had torn along the creases, and a small, frayed piece of cloth from his childhood blanket. He told me once, 

I never forgot that. Because in a way, isn't that what we both do? We help prevent unraveling—whether at the seam or at the soul.
[A]: That’s a truth that stays with you, isn’t it— It’s humbling to think how something so small and worn can carry such weight. I hear echoes of that in the people who bring me their heirlooms, their wedding dresses, even something as humble as a workman’s apron. They trust me with objects that, to them, are inseparable from who they are or who they’ve loved.

And yes, it is custodianship—I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but that word fits perfectly. You’re not just preserving fabric; you’re holding space for someone’s story, their griefs, their joys, sometimes even their guilt or shame. Each thread has been touched by life, pulled tight under tension, stained by tears or sweat or time.

I had a client once—a man in his seventies—who brought me his father’s old flannel shirt. He didn’t want it altered or cleaned, just stabilized where the seams were splitting. He said,  As I worked on it, I noticed faint traces of pipe tobacco and cedar in the fabric, almost like ghosts of his presence still clinging to the fibers. That shirt wasn’t clothing anymore—it was a vessel.

So yes, we do help prevent unraveling. And maybe that’s one of the quietest, most sacred kinds of work there is. Not flashy, not dramatic, but deeply human.
[B]: That sense of quiet sanctity—yes, you've captured it exactly. There's something profoundly human in the act of preservation, isn't there? It’s not spectacle. It doesn’t demand attention. But it  bear witness. And that, I think, is what people are really asking for when they place those objects in our hands: a witness to what matters, to what shaped them, to what they refuse to let disappear.

I recall a similar case—a woman who brought me a box of letters tied with twine, brittle with age, some stained beyond readability. She didn’t ask me to interpret them, or even read them. She simply said,  Her mother had passed years earlier, and yet in those ink-smudged pages, she still found companionship. Even solace.

In forensic psychiatry, we often talk about continuity of self—how individuals maintain identity despite trauma, illness, or incarceration. But what you're describing goes deeper. It’s not just continuity—it’s , the kind that lingers in cloth, scent, fiber, and fold. It becomes an extension of the person who wore it, lived in it, loved in it.

Your flannel shirt—its cedar and pipe tobacco ghosts—that’s not sentimentality. That’s a form of psychological persistence. The fabric holds its shape so the man can still hold his. And in doing so, it resists the slow erasure time tries to impose.

Yes, this work we do—it may be quiet, but it is never small. It is stewardship of the intimate. And perhaps, in the end, that’s the most enduring service we can offer one another: helping others keep hold of what helps them remain whole.
[A]: You’ve put into words something I’ve felt for a long time but never quite named. Stewardship of the intimate—yes, that’s it exactly. It’s not just about preserving fabric or fibers, but the invisible threads that bind people to their past, to their loved ones, to the moments that shaped them.

I think often about how fragile those connections can be. A single tear in a seam, a smudge on a letter, a scent that fades—and suddenly something vital feels lost. But if you catch it in time, if you mend carefully, if you reinforce without overwriting, then the connection holds. The person can still reach back and feel something real beneath their fingers.

There’s a quiet dignity in that kind of work. No one’s going to write headlines about a patched quilt or a stabilized collar, but someone will sleep better knowing their grandmother’s shawl is still wearable. Someone else will stand a little taller in a suit they thought had seen its last day.

And maybe that’s what matters most—that we help people move through the world still wearing the lives they’ve lived, rather than feeling stripped of them.

I don’t know about you, but I find great comfort in that. That even as we age, as we wear down, as we lose things along the way, there are ways—small, careful, deliberate ways—to keep holding on. To keep  who we are, stitch by stitch, word by word, memory by memory.

That’s not small work. Not at all.
[B]: No, it’s not small work at all. In fact, I would argue it's some of the most essential labor we can engage in—tending to the delicate weave of identity, ensuring that even as time pulls at the threads, the pattern remains intact enough for the person who carries it.

You know, in forensic psychiatry, we often speak in terms of —can a person regulate their emotions, maintain employment, comply with legal stipulations—but what you're describing goes beyond function. It's about . About continuity of self in the face of erosion. And that, I think, is where true healing—or at least resilience—begins.

I’ve worked with patients who have lost nearly everything: family, freedom, dignity. And yet, so often, they cling to something small—a photo softened by handling, a ring that no longer fits, a letter memorized from reading and rereading. These aren’t just objects; they are anchors to a sense of self that predates trauma or crime. They are proof that once, someone was loved, or hopeful, or simply ordinary in ways that matter deeply.

And when those items begin to fail—when the photograph curls at the edges, when the ink blurs, when the cloth turns to dust under the fingers—it mirrors an internal fear of disintegration. That’s why your work, and mine, feels almost sacred at times. Because we’re not just preserving materials or memories. We are offering people a way to remain tethered—to their story, to their lineage, to themselves.

So yes, let the headlines go to others. Let the fanfare belong to the new, the bold, the dramatic. What we do is quieter, but no less vital. We help people walk through life still wearing who they are. Not pristine. Not untouched. But whole, in the only way that truly matters.
[A]: Hearing you speak of it like that——it makes me realize how much of what we do is about dignity. Not the kind that comes from status or success, but the quiet kind that comes from still recognizing yourself in something, even when life has worn you thin.

I had a client not long ago—a woman in her eighties—who brought me a pair of gloves her late husband had given her on their honeymoon. The leather was cracked, the stitching nearly gone, and she knew they’d never be wearable again. Still, she asked if I could “make them last just a little longer.” We talked while I worked, and she told me how he used to take her hand in his each time they walked through the garden, how the gloves had brushed together as they held hands in the car. She didn’t need them to be new, only... . A physical echo of a love that still lived in her bones.

That’s the thing about textiles—they hold more than shape. They carry touch, memory, intention. And when we preserve them, we’re preserving all of that, too.

So yes, let the world chase after the shiny and the new. I’ll keep tending to the worn, the loved, the nearly-lost. Because in every frayed edge and faded thread, there’s a story that still wants to be held close. And I consider it a great honor to help make that possible.
[B]: There’s a profound dignity in that kind of devotion—tending not just to fabric, but to the echoes of human connection woven into it. That woman and her gloves… what a moving testament to how love lingers in the physical world, even after the hands that held it are still.

You reminded me of a patient I once worked with—a man who had lost his wife to a long illness and, soon after, developed a compulsive need to preserve every item she had ever touched. Her dresses remained in the closet, her toothbrush in the holder, even the pillow she used was kept, unwashed, on his side of the bed. On the surface, it might have looked like denial, or pathology. But when I asked him why he couldn’t let go, he said something that stays with me: 

That’s the quiet fear so many carry—that their story, or the story of someone they loved, will fade unnoticed. And yet, we live in a culture obsessed with the new, the untouched, the unblemished. As if impermanence were a flaw rather than a fact of life.

But you and I—we work against that current. We help ensure that memory has a place to rest, that affection has something to cling to, that people don’t have to face the passage of time entirely empty-handed.

I suppose that’s what makes our work more than technical—it’s emotional custodianship, as you so beautifully put it. Every thread reinforced, every fragment saved, is a small act of resistance against oblivion. Not because we can stop time—we can’t—but because we can give people something real to hold onto while they still can.

And yes, that is an honor. One I try never to take lightly.
[A]: That man’s words——they reach right into the heart of what we do. Because isn’t that part of what it means to be human? We want to be remembered. We want those we've loved to remain, even if only in the quiet corners of a preserved glove or a pillow held close.

I think often about how fragile memory is on its own—how easily it blurs, how quickly it softens at the edges like an over-handled photograph. But cloth… cloth remembers differently. It holds shape, scent, pressure, warmth. A dress still carries the imprint of the body that wore it. A quilt knows the weight of the person who slept beneath it. Even after time dulls the color and frays the hems, the feeling remains woven in.

It makes me grateful for the slow, careful nature of my work. I don’t rush through a mend because I know it’s more than fabric I’m tending to—it’s someone’s last physical tether to a moment, a place, a person. I stitch not just to hold things together, but to say: . 

And yes, it is an honor. One I carry quietly, one thread at a time.
[B]: You've said it with such grace— And isn’t that, in the end, what we all long to hear affirmed? Not just about grand achievements or public milestones, but about the small, intimate things: a shared walk through the garden, a hand held in the car, a pillow clutched in grief. Those are the moments that shape a life, and yes, they deserve to be remembered.

I often think of how similar this is to the work I do with patients who have been overlooked, dismissed, or condemned—people whose stories have been reduced to diagnoses or case numbers. When I sit with them, when I listen not just to their words but to the silences between them, I’m reminded that every person carries a kind of emotional fabric, stitched together from love, loss, neglect, and hope. And sometimes, my role is simply to bear witness—to say, , , .

There’s a quiet dignity in being seen. In having your story handled with care. And whether it’s cloth or psyche, we both know that mending isn't about erasing the past—it's about making space for it to coexist with the present. To let people carry what they need to carry, without shame, without erasure, without forgetting who they’ve been.

So thank you—for reminding me why this work,  work, is worth doing. Not for applause, not for recognition, but because someone, somewhere, will look down at a repaired hem or run their fingers over a familiar weave and feel just a little more whole.

And that, Dr. Whitmore would say, is no small thing.
