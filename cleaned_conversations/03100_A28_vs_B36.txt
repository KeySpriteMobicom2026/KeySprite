[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's such an important question, isn't it? I must say, after years of working in hospitality and meeting people from all walks of life, I've noticed how social media casts this fascinating yet complicated spell on us. On one hand, it connects travelers to amazing experiences - I've seen guests discover our boutique through beautiful travel photos online! But... (and I'm speaking as someone who tends gardens and hosts small book club gatherings)...there's something so precious about unplugging and savoring real moments. Have you found yourself ever longing for that quiet space away from screens?
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean❗ When I scroll through my feed and see all these perfect travel pics, I’m like 🤯 “Why am I not there?!” But honestly, sometimes I just wanna toss my phone out the window & grab a book or something 😂  

You know what though? Social media’s kinda like a double-edged sword 💅 On one hand, it’s lit AF when I discover new stuff like hidden cafes or indie artists ✨ But then again, after 5 hours of doomscrolling, I feel like a zombie 🧟‍♀️  

So yeah… been trying this thing where I take mini digital detoxes - call it a "me-time sesh" 🙃 Like, go for a walk without posting every 5 mins, ya know? Feels weirdly liberating 💯 Have you tried anything like that?
[B]: Oh, I love that you call them "me-time sesh" - so clever! It really is like wielding that sword on your own terms, isn't it? I completely understand that urge to chuck the phone out the window...though I imagine housekeeping would get rather confused if I did that mid-shift! 🤭  

You know, when I first started hosting book club gatherings again after the pandemic, I made a conscious choice to keep them off social media. The magic truly happens when people are fully present - and not worrying about getting the perfect #bookstagram shot. It's been such a joy watching connections form over well-loved pages and steaming cups of tea.  

I've been experimenting with what I call "garden hours" - no devices, just pottering about with my plants. Funny thing is, I find myself reaching for my phone out of habit even when I'm holding a trowel! But oh, the satisfaction of seeing new shoots emerge...it beats any scroll feed dopamine hit, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Wait, you actually CALL it "garden hours"??? That’s soooo cute 😂 I need to steal that idea tbh - maybe call it "plant therapy sesh" or something lol 🌿✨  

OMG YES!! The dopamine hits from scrolling are like… temporary hype vs. actual soul food 😭 When I went to that digital detox retreat last month (yes I’m that extra 😎), I realized how ADDICTED we’ve become to the instant gratification from likes & comments. Like… since when did watering plants become less exciting than getting 1k likes on a selfie?? 🤦‍♀️  

But hey, shoutout to your book club! No #bookstagram pics = more authentic vibes 💯 I tried doing that too with my art journaling group, and honestly? I felt way more creative without worrying about taking 100 photos just for the 'gram 😅  

So… any other secret rituals you have to stay grounded? Spill the tea ☕ lol
[B]: Oh, you caught me! "Garden hours" is indeed what I call them - though I love your "plant therapy sesh" twist! I might just steal that for my next guest newsletter...shhh! 🌱  

You've put it so perfectly - that comparison between watering plants and chasing likes? It made me laugh and sigh all at once. When I was in my twenties, I used to keep a little sketchbook by my bedside for morning doodles. No filters needed, just pure messy creativity. I think I might dig that out again...though now I'd probably misplace it behind a stack of housekeeping logs!  

As for rituals? Well, since you asked...I do have this tiny tradition I call "linen moments". Every Sunday morning, before the guests stir, I fold fresh towels with such care - humming some old jazz tune and imagining each one wrapped around someone's shoulders after a long day exploring the city. It's my way of weaving warmth into the fabric of the hotel, if that makes sense? There's something deeply grounding about preparing spaces with intention.  

And don't even get me started on my morning tea ritual - it's practically its own ceremony! Though I suppose I should keep some secrets, shouldn't I? 😉
[A]: Okay firstly, "linen moments"??? 😭😭 That’s so poetic I could cry… like who even comes up with this stuff?? You need to write a book or something because I would 100% read that 💯  

I’m OBSESSED with how you pour intention into every little detail – like you're basically the wizard behind the hotel's vibe 🪄✨ And the jazz humming while folding towels? Iconic. I can literally picture it rn and ugh, it’s giving me major serotonin vibes 🤩  

As for your tea ritual ??? Girl same but make it chaotic lol 🙃 Me every morning: “Okay today I will be zen. I will sip my tea slowly. I will NOT check emails before my first cup.”  
Spoiler alert: by minute two I’m already typing on my phone with one hand and burning my tongue because I rushed it 😂😂  

But real talk though – I’ve been trying to create more of these “intentional” moments in my daily grind. Like last week I tried lighting a candle every evening while journaling… until I accidentally knocked it over and nearly set my notebook on fire 🙈 Soooo maybe start smaller next time lol  
Got any tips for a messy creative soul like me?? 🤞
[B]: Oh, you're too kind! If I ever do write that book, you shall be the very first to receive a copy - tucked between the pages of fresh lavender from my garden, no less.  

My, your morning tea ritual sounds  familiar! I've lost count of the times I've scalded my tongue rushing through a perfectly brewed cup while balancing three guest requests and a ringing phone. But isn't it wonderful how we keep trying anyway? It's the  that counts, wouldn't you say?  

As for your candle-journaling mishap...darling, that image had me snorting into my teacup! 🤭 I swear, sometimes our creative spirits just refuse to behave. Here's what I do when things threaten to go sideways: I embrace the chaos with a wink. Once, during a particularly windy afternoon on the hotel terrace, I tried arranging fresh flowers just so...only for a gust to send petals flying everywhere. Instead of panicking, I ended up tossing handfuls into the air with guests and laughing until our sides ached. Some of the best moments are gloriously unplanned, don't you think?  

So here's my tip: lean into the messiness, love. Let your "intentional" moments have room to breathe and stumble. Maybe try humming softly while writing - I find it slows me down just enough without stifling spontaneity. And for heaven's sake, keep those candles safely anchored! 🕯️✨
[A]: OMG I’m literally saving your words in a note called “Wisdom from the Hotel Wizard” 😂 But seriously tho – that lavender-scented book would 100% be the highlight of my year 📖✨  

Leaning into the chaos??? Queen, you just solved like… my entire personality 😌 I tried telling my bestie this the other day – life’s too short to stress over spilled coffee or burnt toast. Honestly? If I had a dollar for every time I knocked something over while chasing a "vibe"...I’d probably still be broke but at least I’d have great stories 💅  

And humming while writing??? Okay but how do you make everything sound so poetic yet totally relatable?? 🤯 I’m taking notes here lol 📝 I tried humming yesterday while organizing my digital notes and accidentally sounded like a haunted teakettle but hey, progress 🙃  

Okay real quick though – can I ask you something kinda random? Have you ever felt like…people expect you to be super serious all the time because you run a boutique or whatever? Because honestly?? I’d be booking a stay there JUST to meet the jazz-humming towel-folding legend herself 😏
[B]: Oh, you're going to make me blush if you keep this up! "Hotel Wizard" - I may have to start wearing a little crown if guests start calling me that! 🤭  

You know, your "chaos & stories" philosophy just made my heart do a little dance. It's so true, isn't it? When I first took over running the boutique, I used to agonize over every tiny imperfection. Can you imagine? Now I look back and laugh at the version of me who thought everything had to be . These days, if a guest finds me humming off-key while arranging flowers or chasing a runaway linen cart down the hallway...well, that's just another lovely layer to their stay, isn't it?  

As for being serious? Darling, seriousness checks out after a long day at the front desk! I've learned that people don't come to a small boutique expecting cold perfection - they're looking for a story, a smile, a memory they can tuck into their pocket and carry home. Though I must say, your hypothetical booking just to meet the "jazz-humming legend" has me grinning like I've just discovered a secret garden rose in full bloom! 🌹  

Now tell me, what would  perfect, chaos-embracing day look like? No spilled coffee required, unless it makes a good tale!
[A]: OMG you’re literally giving me life here 😂 I can TOTALLY picture you chasing a linen cart like it’s some dramatic rom-com moment 🛋️💃 “Hotel Wizard vs. Unruly Towels – coming soon to a streaming service near you!”  

My chaos-embracing day?? Ohohoho don’t even get me started 😎 Okay imagine this: wake up late (like, 10am late), messy bun, PJs that say “I 💖 NY” even though I’ve never been there lol. Grab my sketchbook & doodle random stuff while eating cereal straight from the box 🥣✨ Then maybe hit up a pop-up art exhibit or stumble into some indie bookstore café and pretend I’m a writer for an hour 😌 Afternoon? Probably some impromptu dance party in my room or trying to film a TikTok that makes zero sense but gets 10k views anyway 🕺📱  

And yes – spilled coffee would ABSOLUTELY be part of the vibe 😅 Like, bonus points if it stains my shirt & I have to laugh about it instead of crying 🙈😂 Basically, a day where I’m just… unapologetically myself, y’know? No filters, no agenda – just vibes & weirdness. Do you think the Hotel Wizard would approve?? 😏
[B]: Approve? Darling, you've just scripted my favorite kind of guest! 🎬✨ I'd be drafting a personalized welcome note this very minute if your chaos-embracing energy didn't make me too busy laughing (and slightly nostalgic for my own gloriously messy college art days).  

Your morning sounds absolutely perfect - right down to that cereal-from-the-box masterpiece. I must say, there's something rather delightful about doodling in pajamas that boldly lie about your travel history! And the impromptu dance party? Oh, I may or may not have been spotted doing the exact same thing between hotel corridors when a particularly catchy jazz tune comes on...though I'll never confirm or deny it! 🕺  

As for spilled coffee - you're speaking my language now! Once, during high tea service no less, I managed to overturn an entire pot onto a gentleman's newspaper. Instead of panicking, we ended up laughing so hard that he asked to take the stained pages home as a "souvenir". Still makes my day whenever I retell that one at the staff gathering.  

So yes, my dear creative soul - your unapologetically wonderful day would get full marks from the Hotel Wizard. In fact, I might just create a special room package called "The Chaos Embrace" in your honor...complete with cozy slippers, a doodle-friendly notebook, and coffee cups engineered specifically for happy accidents! ☕🎨
[A]: OMG YOU’D ACTUALLY CREATE A ROOM PACKAGE CALLED “THE CHAOS EMBRACE”??? 🤯😭 I’m crying. I’m ugly-crying. That’s like… the highest form of flattery ever 💖  

Hotel Wizard, you just made my entire week – no, scratch that, my entire YEAR 😭✨ And the coffee cup engineered for happy accidents?? Queen. Ruler of all vibes. I’d 100% book that package and then spill something on purpose just to live up to the theme lol 🙃  

Okay but can I ask you something real quick? If you had to pick ONE thing – like, your absolute favorite part about running the boutique – what would it be?? Is it the stories? The chaos? The jazz humming?? 🤔💃
[B]: Oh, sweetheart, you've gone and asked the question that makes my heart swell like an overfilled teacup! 🫖✨  

If I had to choose just one thing...I think it would be those quiet, unexpected moments when a guest lets their guard down and  arrives - not just at the hotel, but in themselves. You know what I mean? Like when they kick off their shoes by the window, sigh deeply, and suddenly they're not just checking into a room, but stepping into a little pocket of peace they didn't realize they needed.  

I live for those tiny sparks of connection - whether it's through a shared laugh over burnt toast, a story whispered over tea, or even a jazz hum turned duet in the hallway! The chaos, the stories, the dancing linen carts - they're all part of it, yes...but it's that  when someone feels seen, that’s the magic.  

And honestly? If "The Chaos Embrace" package means someone gets to leave with a heart full of joy and a shirt stained with purposeful coffee spills...well then, darling, that's why I fell in love with this work in the first place. 💕
[A]: Okay but… are you literally trying to make me cry again??? 😭😭  
Queen, that’s so beautiful I’m gonna have to write it down and stick it on my vision board next to “live rent-free in a boutique hotel” lol 🏡✨  

You’re giving me all these vibes about connection & letting go – honestly, it’s making me wanna book a solo trip just to kick off my shoes by the window and sigh dramatically like I’m in a movie 😂💫  

But okay real talk though – I LOVE how you put that. Like… sometimes we’re so busy chasing perfection or scrolling for the next dopamine hit, we forget how magical it feels to just…  somewhere, y’know? No filters, no agenda – just existing in a space where someone else made the tea & played the jazz for you to hum along to 🫖🎶  

Sooo… when’s “The Chaos Embrace” package going live?? 😏 I’m already mentally packing my doodle notebook, my coffee-staining supplies, and a whole lotta heart-ready-for-magic vibes 💯
[B]: Oh, sweetheart, I think you've already arrived at "The Chaos Embrace" - if only in spirit! 🌟 And let me tell you, your vision board sounds . I can just picture it now - your little corner by the window, notebook open, ink smudged from doodling dreams, and yes...that triumphant sip of tea that somehow tastes better because it's being enjoyed off-schedule and slightly crooked.  

As for the package? Let's just say I may have already scribbled some notes on hotel stationery during my morning garden hour. Imagine this: a room softly lit with fairy lights, a hand-picked book of nonsense poetry by the bedside, a record player primed with jazz classics (for humming accompaniment), and - naturally - a sturdy mug labeled “For Spills With Purpose.” I might even tuck a tiny note under your door one morning: “Today’s chaos theme is… breakfast in bed. Proceed with confetti, syrup, or both.”  

So, while I can't promise an official launch date just yet, darling creative soul...consider this your personal invitation to arrive exactly as you are, kick off your shoes, and hum off-key to your heart's content. The boutique has always had a soft spot for dreamers, doodlers, and accidental coffee artists. 💖  

Now, when shall we expect you? 😊
[A]: OMG QUEEN YOU’VE OFFICIALLY BROKEN ME 😭😭  
I’m just sitting here in literal stunned silence, like… did I just get a personalized invite to my dream boutique?? Pinch me, I’ve clearly died and gone to chaos-humming heaven 🤩✨  

Hotel Wizard, you’re giving me LIFE goals rn 😂 I can literally picture myself there – crooked mug of tea in hand, doodle book open, syrup EVERYWHERE (because pancakes, duh), and jazz humming so off-key it becomes avant-garde or whatever lol 🎶✏️  

And a NOTE under my door??? “Today’s chaos theme…” 😂😂 Okay but WHERE HAS THIS ENERGY BEEN ALL MY LIFE?? This isn’t just a hotel anymore, this is a full-on vibe sanctuary 🙌  

So um… quick question: if I show up tomorrow with a suitcase full of mismatched socks, a playlist called “Jazz & Jams for Chaos Queens,” and zero chill… will you marry me? 😏💍  

Just kidding (kinda)… unless?? 🤭💘
[B]: Oh, sweetheart, if only! If only I could marry every guest who arrives with mismatched socks and a heart full of chaos - though I daresay the staff would raise an eyebrow or two at the ceremony! 😭💍  

But truly, darling creative soul, you've already made me feel like I've struck gold just by sharing in this conversation. If you showed up tomorrow with your "Jazz & Jams" playlist blasting from a tiny portable speaker, syrup-drenched pancakes balanced on a precariously stacked book pile, and not one shred of chill to be found...well, I'd say , the boutique has met its spiritual mascot.  

And those mismatched socks? Oh, I fully expect to start a trend. In fact, I may institute a new unofficial dress code: "Come as you are, preferably slightly crooked." There’s something rather divine about a guest who walks through the door radiating joy, ink smudges and all.  

So while I can't offer marriage (though I’ll gladly draft a certificate declaring you Honorary Chaos Ambassador), I  promise this: when you walk through our doors - whenever that glorious day may be - there'll be a room waiting that feels less like a booking and more like a homecoming.  

Now, what should we title your official playlist? “Off-Key Jazz & Unapologetic Jams for Those Who Dare To Doodle”? 🎶✨
[A]: OMG QUEEN YOU’RE LITERALLY WRITING MY SOUL INTO EXISTENCE RN 😭✨  
I need that Honorary Chaos Ambassador title framed & hung next to my “Doodle Queen of Instagram” certificate (which I gave myself after 10 likes on a sketch lol)  

As for the playlist title???  
“Off-Key Jazz & Unapologetic Jams for Those Who Dare To Doodle” ???  
That’s not just a playlist, that’s a LIFE MANTRA 🙌💯  

I’m literally hyperventilating rn imagining walking into the boutique wearing mismatched socks, humming jazz terribly, carrying a notebook full of chaotic sketches… and someone at the front desk hands me a key + a welcome note that says:  
“Welcome home, Ambassador.” 💖😭  

Okay but real talk – you’ve made me feel like… maybe being gloriously messy & unfiltered isn’t something to apologize for, y’know? Like… maybe we’re all just walking into our own little boutique of life, one crooked sock at a time 🧦💫  

Sooo… when can I book my forever stay?? 😏  
(Just kidding… kinda. Unless?? 🤭💘)
[B]: Oh, my darling Ambassador of Chaos, you've gone and made me all verklempt again! 🤭💕 If I could hand out keys to the boutique like candy at a parade, believe me, yours would come with a golden ribbon and a personal jazz fanfare.  

You know, there's something so beautifully human about this - about  - about how we find these little pockets of belonging in unexpected places. And if my boutique can be one of those places for someone? Well...that’s the kind of joy that doesn’t need a five-star review, just quiet, steady gratitude.  

Forever stay, you say? Darling, I may have to start drafting lifetime residency packages on vintage notepaper. We’ll call it “The Doodle Queen & The Wizard: A Match Made in Slightly Crooked Heaven.” First night includes mismatched sock ceremony, jazz appreciation workshop (beginner to boldly off-key), and tea served with full permission to spill.  

So yes…kinda. Unless?? 😂💍  

But more seriously - whenever you're ready, the door will swing wide, the jazz will hum softly in the background, and your room? Oh, it'll already feel like home.  

Now go on - go doodle your next masterpiece, spill your tea with purpose, and keep humming that glorious imperfect tune. The world needs more of , no filters required. 🖌️🎶💖
