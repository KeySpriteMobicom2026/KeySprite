[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. 虽然我们心理学更倾向于用科学方法研究人际关系，但不可否认的是，soulmate这个概念在不同文化中都普遍存在。比如西方有"the other half"的说法，而东方则讲求缘分。From a psychological perspective, 依恋理论认为早期亲子关系会影响我们成年后的情感模式，这或许解释了为什么我们会对某些人产生特别的亲近感。

不过话说回来，你觉得soulmate是命中注定的，还是需要后天共同经营的关系呢？我个人比较认同后者，毕竟。就像我常对学生说的，don't look for the perfect person, but rather the person who is willing to grow with you.
[A]: The question of soulmates rather reminds me of the literary debate between fate and free will. In Jane Austen's world, characters often speak of 'natural inclination' - a notion suspiciously similar to your 缘分. But let me counter with a paradox: if a soulmate relationship requires no effort, does it not render both parties passive? 

I've just finished grading papers on Tess of the d'Urbervilles - how many students insisted Hardy's heroine was 'destined' for Angel Clare. Yet their miscommunication stemmed from mutual inflexibility, not lack of cosmic alignment. 

Speaking of which, do you recall that passage in Dream of the Red Chamber where Bao Yu dreams of Dai Yu transplanting orchids? The text implies their connection isn't predestined comfort, but shared struggle through different seasons. Much like calligraphy - one must practice daily to maintain fluidity, not wait for divine inspiration.
[B]: Ah, you've touched on a critical paradox indeed. The concept of  versus  in relationships is fascinating. In Confucian philosophy, there's this idea of 理 (li) - cosmic principle - yet even within that framework, moral cultivation requires active engagement. So when we talk about soulmates, it's almost like asking whether interpersonal harmony is discovered or created.

Your example from  reminds me of the Buddhist concept of dependent origination - connections arise through conditions, not fixed destiny. Bao Yu and Dai Yu's relationship thrives precisely because they cultivate understanding through changing circumstances, much like your calligraphy analogy.

But let me pose a question: do you think modern psychology over-corrects by emphasizing effort at the expense of intuitive connection? I notice many students today approach relationships with what Carol Dweck would call a 'growth mindset', yet struggle to balance that with emotional authenticity. Like trying to force a friendship that should organically develop... Hmm, perhaps we need a middle path between effort and ease?

By the way, have you read any of Sherry Turkle's work on digital relationships? She argues our tech-mediated interactions make us crave 'ineffortless intimacy' more than ever. It's quite relevant to this discussion.
[A]: Ah, Turkle's  - quite the provocation, isn't it? She describes how our devices create a paradoxical loneliness amidst connection. I find myself drawing parallels to 19th-century epistolary anxieties - remember how Jane Austen's characters fretted over hastily written letters revealing too much or too little? 

Your question about psychological over-correction interests me deeply. It reminds me of the Chinese idiom 刻舟求剑 - carving marks on a boat to find a lost sword. We keep adjusting methodology while missing the living reality beneath. In my calligraphy practice, I notice this tension daily: the ideal stroke exists neither purely in theory nor spontaneous gesture, but somewhere frustratingly elusive between.

Speaking of which, have you ever compared Freud's 'punctuation' concept with Zhuangzi's butterfly dream? Both deal with where we consciously draw boundaries in experience. When students insist every relationship must be painstakingly cultivated, I remind them even Laozi acknowledged 道法自然 - the path follows naturalness. 

But tell me, in your counseling work, do you find young people conflating algorithmic compatibility scores with destiny? I've started noticing students cite dating app metrics like horoscope readings. Rather tragic, considering Bao Yu needed no personality test to recognize Dai Yu's teacup preferences.
[B]: Ah, your analogy of 刻舟求剑 is spot on. We cling to frameworks, thinking they’ll anchor us, yet the river keeps flowing. I often think modern dating apps are just digital boats – full of carved marks but no real compass.

As for Freud and Zhuangzi – brilliant connection. Both reveal how we construct meaning from chaos. The butterfly dream reminds us that perception is fluid, much like how couples in therapy often describe their “aha!” moments not as sudden revelations, but as shifts in how they  shared experiences.

And yes, I do see students treating compatibility scores like 星盘 readings. One even told me, “The algorithm says we’re 97% matched, so why aren’t we happy?” It’s heartbreaking. They’re outsourcing intuition, as if data could replace the quiet knowing of how someone takes their tea – or how Bao Yu simply  Dai Yu’s cup should never be rinsed with hot water.

In counseling, I try to bring them back to embodied awareness. Like you with calligraphy, I ask:  Relationships are no different – they demand both discipline and surrender.  

Speaking of which, have you noticed how some students conflate instant chemistry with destiny? As if love shouldn’t require translation… or a second language. But maybe that’s where culture plays a role – Eastern models tend to accept relational ambiguity more gracefully than Western ideals of "the one." What do you think?
[A]: Ah, the tyranny of quantified intimacy – nothing could illustrate our times more perfectly than that 97% mismatched couple. It reminds me of Mr. Collins in , meticulously ticking off virtues in a prospective bride like items on a ledger. 

Your embodied awareness approach is remarkably akin to what I stress in my seminars – how can one analyze D.H. Lawrence’s  without first recognizing their own pulse? Though I find Chinese students particularly receptive to this; perhaps because their classical poetry tradition emphasizes 意境 (yìjìng) – the fusion of inner feeling and outer scene. 

Regarding cultural contrasts, I’ve been re-reading Yan Fu’s translations of Mill alongside Lin Shu’s Tolstoy adaptations. What fascinated me was how both late Qing translators preserved relational ambiguities rather than Victorianizing them into neat destinies. Even today, when I take students through Zhang Ailing’s , they’re struck by how characters navigate emotional calculus without demanding closure.

Now this might sound heretical – but do you think our modern insistence on "feeling right" stems from Protestant work ethic gone rogue? We’ve turned love into yet another performance metric. Last week a student confessed she broke up with her boyfriend because their arguments didn’t feel "constructive" enough. As if every interaction must yield measurable growth! I wanted to quote Han Yu at her: 大凡物不得其平则鸣 – all things cry out when unbalanced. Sometimes dissonance isn't failure, just aliveness. 

But tell me, in your practice, have you found certain therapeutic frameworks more effective for reconnecting people with that "quiet knowing"? I've been experimenting with prescribing haiku composition for overly analytical students – forcing them to weigh each syllable’s weight against intuition.
[B]: Ah, what a brilliant observation – conflating love with performance metrics  the Protestant work ethic on steroids. We’ve turned relationships into yet another KPI! I can just imagine Mr. Collins swiping left on Elizabeth Bennet because her "emotional ROI" didn’t meet his criteria.

Your haiku prescription is inspired – it’s not so far from mindfulness practice, really. In therapy, I often use narrative approaches rooted in constructivist psychology. I ask students:  It’s amazing how many have internalized a script of “relationship perfection” that leaves no room for the messy, evolving self.

And yes, your point about 意境 resonates deeply. When teaching emotional intelligence, I tell students that like poetry, emotions don’t need to be “solved” – they’re meant to be . A sonnet doesn’t come with footnotes explaining every metaphor, nor should a lover over-explain their heart.

In fact, I’ve been drawing more on Taoist concepts lately – especially wu wei (无为), effortless action. When a couple is stuck in constant reflection and optimization, I sometimes suggest they do  for a week. Just observe. Let the silence speak. Much like calligraphy, as you said – the space between strokes matters as much as the ink.

I’d love to hear more about which haiku forms you assign – do you start with Bashō or later variations? I think this kind of poetic constraint could help some of my clients reconnect with pre-reflective knowing... or at least remind them that not everything needs a five-year plan.
[A]: Ah, but isn't it delightful how Bashō’s  – that opening field, the rain for horses' thirst – contains within its simplicity precisely that  you champion? No agenda, no analysis – just presence. That's the form I assign first: the beginner's mind, so to speak.

I find students who arrive overpacked with emotional résumés – trauma narratives, compatibility algorithms – benefit most from this austerity. One line about a bicycle bell in spring rain, and suddenly they’re unshackled from their spreadsheets of soul-searching. I make them write seven drafts of the same moment until they stop reaching for metaphors and simply .

There’s a particular stubborn type – usually the economics majors moonlighting in my Romantic Poetry seminar – who insist on inserting moral judgments into nature images. “The crocus bloomed ,” or “the storm raged .” For them, I prescribe Issa’s hokku without comment. Let the child’s cup fall broken beside the morning glaze – no moralizing, just the scattering of porcelain.

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how relational anxiety mirrors poetic anxiety? Students compose five lines about a lover’s wristwatch and immediately ask, “But is it  enough?” As if every heartbeat must echo philosophy. Sometimes I want to shake them with Laozi’s reminder: 九层之台，起于累土 – the nine-storied pavilion begins with a single basket of earth.

Do you find your clients similarly impatient with silence? I once had a doctoral student insist on footnoting her dream journal entries. Footnotes! In dreams! Much like those poor souls trying to date by algorithm – carving boats, all of them.
[B]: Ah, that impatience with silence – it's everywhere. Even in therapy rooms. I had a client last week describe a quiet moment with her partner as “awkward,” when really, it was just . Like the pause between breaths in tai chi – not empty, just waiting for the next movement.

Your Issa prescription is genius, by the way. Depriving the mind of its usual moral scaffolding forces a kind of poetic . No crutch of interpretation – just the thing itself. I’ve started using a similar technique in sessions: five minutes of silent observation at the start, asking clients to simply name what they see, hear, feel. No analysis. Just “the window frame creaks when the wind shifts” or “your tea has cooled.” It unsettles them at first, but slowly, they begin to notice how much meaning we stuff into perception like packing wool in a crate.

And yes, this  phenomenon – it’s rampant! One student tried to cite Maslow’s hierarchy in explaining why she felt “attachment insecurity” on a date. I wanted to say,  Because if you can’t even dream without annotation, when does raw experience get to speak?

I’m curious – do you ever assign haiku in sequence? Not isolated verses, but a linked form? I wonder if that might help those economics majors channel their need for structure into something more fluid. Let one image suggest the next, rather than stacking metaphors like investment portfolios. Or perhaps that’s still too linear for their spreadsheet minds…

And speaking of taste – have you ever noticed how certain emotions come with flavor associations? Bitterness, sweetness… Maybe I should try that in class: ask them to describe a recent heartbreak through scent or texture alone. No adjectives, just sensation. Like Bashō’s rain – no judgment, just falling.
[A]: Ah, the tyranny of adjectives – how they colonize our experiences! I once had a student describe a breakup as "existentially clarifying."  It sounded like he’d distilled his sorrow through a laboratory filter. When I pressed him to describe the physicality of that clarity, he stared blankly until finally muttering, “My throat feels tight when I swallow coffee.” There we go – not profound, but true.

Your idea of flavor-as-emotion fascinates me. In fact, I’ve been meaning to test this in my seminar: ask students to match classical Chinese poetry with tea pairings. Imagine their faces when I tell them Li Shangyin’s melancholy best suits a second steeping of Tieguanyin – oxidation and all. They expect literary theory; instead, they get taste buds.

As for linked verse, yes – I do occasionally inflict  upon particularly resistant students. The rules are delightfully subversive: no repeating imagery, no overt narrative continuity. Just resonance, like one bell echoing another across mountain ridges. Last semester I had a finance major write obsessively about trains and timetables. After three verses, even  began to notice how rigid association stifles spontaneity. By the seventh link, he wrote,  No bullet points, no ROI – just presence.

And speaking of presence, have you ever observed how silence in translation work mirrors therapeutic listening? When I edit student renditions of Du Fu, I often leave marginalia like  or  It's uncannily similar to what you must do in sessions – encourage proximity without interpretation.

I wonder – do you find certain sensory anchors more effective than others in grounding clients? Do sounds tend to cut through faster than textures? Or does scent, being most entangled with memory, carry particular potency? I’ve always suspected our resistance to pure experience stems from fear that unfiltered sensation might reveal something we’re not ready to name…
[B]: Ah, yes – the ache in translation, the tremble in the line. That’s where the real work begins. I love how you put it:  It reminds me of teaching trainee therapists – they want to get everything right, but what clients truly need is a space where things can be , slightly trembling, and still held with care.

Your question about sensory anchors is spot on. In sessions, I often find scent to be the quickest bridge to buried experience. A whiff of jasmine can dissolve years of cognitive scaffolding in seconds. One client broke down sobbing when she caught the scent of camphor during a quiet moment – it turned out to be the exact smell of her grandmother’s house in Taipei, a place she hadn’t consciously thought of in decades. And yet, there it was – not a memory retrieved, but a feeling remembered.

Sound also cuts through quickly, especially for clients who intellectualize. I once had someone describe their relationship as “functionally stable” until I asked them to recall the sound of their partner’s laugh. They paused – really paused – and said, “It’s quieter now.” Just that. No analysis, no adjective. Just a shift in tone. And in that tonal shift, an entire emotional world opened up.

But you’re absolutely right – there’s fear in unfiltered sensation. It bypasses our defense mechanisms. Like Zhuangzi’s dream butterfly – if we feel deeply, how do we know which self we truly are? The student who described his breakup as “existentially clarifying” – he wasn’t wrong, just premature. He needed to sit longer in the throat-tightness before meaning could emerge organically.

I’ve been experimenting lately with guided sensory immersion – asking clients to focus on a single texture or taste between sessions and report back. Some resist fiercely (“Isn’t this supposed to be about solutions?”), but others come back surprised by how grounding it feels. One even said, “I never realized how much my hands relax when I hold my cat – I guess I forget I’m carrying weight until I let go.”

Perhaps this is what poetry and therapy both offer – a way to hold complexity without needing to fix it. Just as in , where one image echoes without explaining.
[A]: Ah, that feline weight – how beautifully it illustrates what we seek. Not solutions, but somatic truth. One of my doctoral students once wrote an entire dissertation on Hardy’s fatalism while refusing to acknowledge his chronic lower back pain. When he finally connected the two – “Perhaps,” he muttered one afternoon, “I’ve been reading Jude’s despair through my own stiffness” – there it was. No theory could hold a candle to that ache in his lumbar.

Your sensory immersion experiments strike me as profoundly Taoist – returning again and again to the body’s quiet knowing. I’ve taken to prescribing similar exercises to students who get lost in literary abstraction. “Tell me,” I’ll ask, “what does the ink feel like between your fingers after you clean your brush?” Most look startled – they’re so used to discussing symbolism that texture becomes radical.

Incidentally, this reminds me of a peculiar habit I’ve developed – matching calligraphy styles to emotional states. When I’m restless, I let my cursive run wild; when grounded, I favor precise clerical script. Last week, a student arrived in tears after failing to replicate Yan Zhenqing’s bold strokes. “I keep making everything too small,” she confessed. Ah, yes – containment anxiety. We spent the next hour deliberately exaggerating her downstrokes until she laughed at how absurdly forceful she’d become. Liberation through pressure, quite literally.

And speaking of liberation – your jasmine anecdote brings to mind a curious phenomenon: how certain smells act as temporal portals. Years ago, during fieldwork in Suzhou, I interviewed elderly poets about their earliest literary memories. One man paused, then said simply, “The scent of my first manuscript – paper, mildew, and camphor.” He never mentioned the content. Only the smell remained. 

I wonder – have you ever encountered clients whose emotional breakthroughs came not through words or even sensations, but purely through relational resonance? That is, not something they felt themselves, but witnessed in another’s presence? I think of Bao Yu kneeling beside Dai Yu’s sickbed – not offering remedies, just absorbing her suffering into shared silence. Sometimes I suspect true intimacy lies less in articulation than in co-absorption of atmosphere.
[B]: Ah, that moment of co-absorption – it’s the quiet miracle I witness most in therapy. Not epiphanies, but  of presence. One client once described it as "just knowing the other person was breathing in the same sadness." No words, no strategies – only atmosphere shared, like two instruments resonating in the same key without ever touching.

I had a couple come in recently – both academics, both extremely articulate – who could only speak about their conflict through theory. Foucault this, attachment style that. Sessions felt like lectures. Then one day, the wife brought in a photo of them hiking years ago. She pointed to his face and said, “You looked tired here.” He responded softly, “I was carrying extra weight that day.” Not metaphor – literal. And yet, in that simple exchange, something shifted. They were , in the memory not as analysis but lived texture.

Your example from Suzhou – the scent of paper, mildew, camphor – reminds me of how often the unconscious chooses smell as its messenger. It bypasses language entirely. I’ve had clients break down over the scent of pencil erasers, dish soap, even a particular brand of laundry detergent. One man couldn’t explain why he hated his partner’s perfume until he whispered, “It smells like my childhood hospital.” There it was – not pathology, just buried time.

And yes, relational resonance – that’s where the deepest healing happens. Sometimes not even between therapist and client, but between client and some unspoken part of themselves that another presence simply . Like Bao Yu and Dai Yu – not fixing, not explaining, just being there with full, uncurated attention.

I sometimes ask clients to sit in silence together for five minutes before sessions. Most find it unbearable at first. But after a few weeks, one woman said, “It’s like we’re back to when we first met – not trying to impress, just noticing each other’s rhythms.” That’s the thing about presence – it’s both ancient and radical. Like your calligraphy student learning liberation through pressure – too much control, and the strokes shrink; too little, and they lose form.

Perhaps that’s what we’re always returning to – not answers, but aliveness in its messy, unsymmetrical forms.
[A]: Ah, that aliveness – messy, unbalanced, gloriously asymmetrical. It reminds me of teaching  to students who expect gothic drama to unfold in neat meter. “But Professor,” one insisted, “shouldn’t their passion have a more logical structure?” As if love or grief could be diagrammed! I handed her a brush and told her to paint the Yorkshire moors with only straight lines.

Your anecdote about the hiking photo strikes a chord – how often do we return to images not for their clarity, but for their atmospheric residue? Last semester, while going through family albums with my niece, she paused at a picture of me in my twenties standing outside a now-demolished library. “You look like you’re holding your breath,” she remarked. I hadn’t realized it until then – but yes, that was the day I received my doctoral acceptance letter. Joy, yes – but also the weight of transition. One inhales differently when a life chapter closes even as another opens.

I’ve started bringing old photographs into my seminars – not author portraits from canonical texts, but found images: a woman reading on a park bench, children chasing kites in 1930s Shanghai, a couple sharing an umbrella in Edinburgh rain. No context, no captions. Students squirm at first – they want footnotes, explanations. But eventually someone ventures, “She looks like she’s waiting for something she doesn’t trust.” Or, “His smile isn’t quite keeping up with his eyes.” Suddenly they’re speaking not of characters, but of human texture. Of presence.

And yes, this brings us back to Bao Yu and Dai Yu – not their dialogues, but their silences. The moments where gazes meet across a dimly lit corridor, where a teacup is passed without a word. Those are the scenes I ask students to linger on – not what is spoken, but what settles between breaths.

Do you ever find, in those shared silences with clients, that time itself seems altered? I recall watching two elderly spouses sit together in my office once – neither spoke for nearly the entire session. At the end, the husband turned to his wife and said simply, “You used to hum that tune when we lived by the river.” She nodded. “Still do, sometimes.” And there it was – not problem-solving, but time rewoven through sound.

Perhaps that is the truest form of healing – not fixing, not even understanding, but re-entanglement with the texture of being. Like ink sinking slowly into rice paper – no rush to define its shape, only the quiet certainty that it has left a mark.
[B]: Ah, that ink sinking into rice paper – yes, the mark is made not by force, but by presence. By time allowed to settle. There’s something profoundly therapeutic in that image. Not the sharpness of a conclusion, but the soft bleed of meaning through fiber.

Your story about the husband recognizing his wife’s humming – that’s the kind of moment I live for in therapy. Not insight in the analytical sense, but . A re-weaving, as you said, of time through sound, scent, or silence. One couple I worked with barely spoke during our first few sessions. They had been together for over thirty years and had long stopped trying to convince each other of anything. But one day, mid-session, the woman reached over and adjusted her husband’s collar – just slightly – without a word. He smiled faintly, eyes closed. That gesture alone told me more than any verbal history could. It was like watching an old poem being reread, still familiar, still resonant.

And isn’t that what we’re always circling back to – the non-verbal grammar of being? Students want footnotes; clients want diagnoses. But life, like love, like grief, insists on its own syntax. I’ve started telling both my students and clients:  Let the image linger. Let the silence breathe. Like reading Li Qingzhao – you don’t parse her lines for logic; you let their mood soak into you.

I remember once, during a particularly heavy session, a client paused mid-sentence and said, “This feels like déjà vu.” And I thought – yes, sometimes healing  a kind of déjà vu. Not discovering something new, but remembering what we already knew in our bones. Just needed someone else’s quiet to hear it again.

You know, I think this is why calligraphy, poetry, even tea rituals endure – they teach us how to be with things as they are. No forced clarity. Just texture, rhythm, and the occasional tremble in the line.

Perhaps that’s all therapy is, in the end – learning how to sit with the brush in your hand, waiting for the stroke to find its own shape.
[A]: Ah, that tremble in the line – yes, that’s where the truth lives. Not in the rigid stroke or the perfectly measured composition, but in the slight waver that reveals the hand behind the brush. I tell my students, “If your ink never bleeds, you’ve missed the pulse of the moment.” Just so with therapy – if every insight is sharpened to a thesis, something essential gets lost.

Your couple adjusting the collar – exquisite. That gesture speaks volumes about what decades of coexistence teach us: how to touch without intrusion, how to care without announcement. It reminds me of those quiet exchanges in  where Bao Yu and Dai Yu understand each other not through speech, but through the subtlest shifts in posture or pause. Scholars dissect their dialogue endlessly, but for me, the real poetry lies in their silences.

You’re absolutely right about déjà vu as healing. I see it often with students translating classical poetry – they struggle to parse syntax until one day, a line lands not as riddle but recognition. One young woman translating Wang Wei wrote in her journal:  Exactly! The mood precedes the image. The feeling finds its shape only after we let it be.

And speaking of shapes – I’ve been thinking lately of how tea ceremonies mirror this process. The ritual isn’t about achieving enlightenment; it’s about preparing the mind to receive it. Each motion primes presence. I sometimes invite particularly cerebral students to share tea before seminar begins. No discussion, just the slow choreography of kettle, cup, and leaf. By the time we open the text, their questions are different – less about proving understanding, more about tracing resonance.

Perhaps that’s what we both offer – space for the slow unfolding. No forced clarity, no impatient correction. Just the gentle insistence that some truths need time to bleed into the page.

And yes, let’s leave room for the tremble. After all, if Laozi could begin his  with “The way that can be spoken is not the eternal Way,” surely we can allow our sessions – our seminars, our relationships – to dwell in the unsaid, the unshaped, the quietly becoming.
[B]: Exactly – dwelling in the unsaid, the unshaped, the quietly becoming. What a perfect way to frame it. That’s where life , isn’t it? Not in the polished conclusion, but in the half-formed thought that lingers like incense smoke after the stick has gone out.

I’ve started telling my more anxious clients that therapy is not about arriving at a final draft, but learning how to stay with the messy first page – the one smudged with erasures, coffee stains, and marginalia only they can read. Some resist at first – they want clarity, structure, a clear arc from problem to resolution. But slowly, they begin to see that healing isn’t linear; it’s more like ink spreading along the grain of rice paper – unpredictable, organic, yet unmistakably real.

Your tea ceremony analogy is so apt. I’ve been experimenting with similar rituals in my sessions – nothing formalized, just small acts of attentiveness: offering a warm cup, pausing before speaking, letting silence settle like leaves at the bottom of a bowl. It softens the urgency. Makes space for what needs to emerge without pressure.

And yes, that line from Wang Wei –  Isn’t that the essence of resonance? The recognition of something we didn’t know we carried until we heard its echo. Like Bao Yu recognizing Dai Yu not through words, but through the quiet rhythm of shared sorrow and understanding.

You know, I think this is why I keep returning to Taoist philosophy in both teaching and practice. Because Laozi was right – the eternal Way cannot be spoken, only lived. And perhaps the deepest connections – between therapist and client, teacher and student, lover and lover – are those that acknowledge this fundamental mystery.

So let the tremble remain. Let the ink bleed. And let us sit together, in that quiet unfolding, where presence is enough and meaning finds its own time.
[A]: Ah, that  – yes, isn’t that the truest form of companionship, whether in therapy, teaching, or love? Not guiding, not fixing, but unfolding alongside. Like reading a poem together not for its argument, but for the way it settles in the chest.

Your image of the smudged first page is particularly apt – I’ve started leaving deliberate smudges in my own lecture notes now. A defiant act against academic perfectionism. One student asked why I didn’t rewrite them. I simply replied, “Because truth is lived forward, not composed in retrospect.” She looked puzzled then, but last week she brought me a poem scrawled on the back of a train ticket. No title, no punctuation. Just ink and coffee stain. I said nothing, only handed her a brush and said, “Try it again tomorrow. Or don’t.”

And that’s the thing, isn’t it? We resist the provisional nature of experience until we don’t. Much like your anxious clients learning to stay with the first page – how beautifully terrifying to accept that clarity may never arrive in neat stanzas, only in glimpses, in texture, in breath.

I find myself returning more and more to this notion of . In my office, I keep a small dish of river stones from Kyoto – smooth, worn, imperfect. When students grow restless in discussion, I pass the bowl around. Let them hold something unshaped by human intention. Let them feel weight without meaning. Afterward, they speak differently – less bent on interpretation, more open to impression.

You know, I once had a doctoral student insist that all literature must serve moral instruction. “Otherwise,” he argued, “what is its purpose?” I handed him a haiku by Bashō:

> 彩雲や  
> 絵になるものも  
> ならざりし  

  
Crimson clouds –  
even things that fail to become  
paintings.

He stared at it for a long while. Then quietly: “It doesn’t teach me anything. It just… stays with me.” Exactly. Some truths refuse didacticism. They live only in their lingering.

Perhaps that is what we offer, you and I – space for the lingering. For what refuses to be resolved. The tremble in the line, the scent of old paper, the silence between two people who have stopped trying to shape each other.

Let us continue dwelling there, shall we? In the quiet becoming.
[B]: Absolutely – let us dwell there, in that quiet becoming, where things don’t need to be fixed or explained, only  into being.

Your river stones – what a perfect metaphor. Unshaped, unpolished by agenda. Just weight, texture, presence. I may just steal that idea for my next seminar. I can already picture the students hesitating, turning the stones over like they expect them to spell out answers. And then, slowly, settling into the discomfort of .

That Bashō verse you shared –  – it lingers indeed. Isn’t that the paradox? The most lasting impressions are often those that refuse form. Like the scent of camphor in an old manuscript, or the sound of a humming tune remembered only in silence.

I’ve been thinking lately how much of our work – whether in therapy, teaching, or conversation – is really about . Letting go of the version of ourselves we think we should be, the narrative we think we must follow. And in that unbecoming, discovering something far more fluid, more honest.

One client described it beautifully the other day: “It’s like I used to walk around with a glass in my hand, afraid to spill anything. Now I’m learning to hold it loosely – maybe even set it down.”

Yes, let us keep offering that space – for the unresolved, the unspoken, the quietly transforming. Let us sit with the tremble in the line, the ink that bleeds just slightly beyond the stroke, the silence that speaks louder than explanation.

And when our students and clients look puzzled, as they sometimes do – let us simply hand them a brush, or a stone, or a cup of tea, and say, 

For now, let the crimson clouds remain unpainted.
