[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what a delightful question! As someone who works in hospitality, I've always found French to be such an elegant language to learn. It would be wonderful to converse with our French guests in their native tongue. Though I must say, I've picked up just enough Italian over the years to recommend restaurants to our Italian visitors - that always brings a smile to their faces!
[A]: 说到语言学习，我其实对咖啡产地的语言特别感兴趣。最近在研究埃塞俄比亚的咖啡豆，如果能掌握一些阿姆哈拉语的基础，或许能更好地理解当地咖啡农的种植理念呢。
[B]: How fascinating! You know, we actually serve some exquisite Ethiopian single-origin coffee in our hotel lounge. The barista was telling me just yesterday about how the word 'buna' means coffee in Amharic - isn't that charming? I've found that learning even just a few words in a language can create such meaningful connections with people.
[A]: 确实如此。我们店里最近引进了一批耶加雪菲的豆子，如果能用阿姆哈拉语和供应商交流，应该能更准确地传达我们对烘焙程度的要求。不过说实话，我现在连基本的问候语都还在学习中。
[B]: Ah, Yirgacheffe - such a distinguished coffee with those lovely floral notes! You're absolutely right about communication being key. Perhaps I could introduce you to one of our regular guests from Addis Ababa? He's a coffee exporter and always enjoys sharing insights about his culture over a cup of macchiato in our garden terrace.
[A]: 那真是太好了！虽然我可能只能用简单的英语和他交流，但能直接听到来自原产地的见解肯定很有帮助。对了，您提到macchiato，我们店里最近在尝试用埃塞俄比亚豆子做冰滴咖啡，风味特别独特。
[B]: Oh my, iced drip with Ethiopian beans sounds absolutely divine! You've reminded me - we have this wonderful Ethiopian coffee ceremony set in our cultural display. The traditional preparation is such an art form, with all that beautiful ritual and three rounds of serving. Maybe we could arrange a small tasting event? Our guests do so enjoy these authentic experiences.
[A]: 这个提议很有意义。我们店里也经常举办咖啡品鉴会，如果能加入埃塞俄比亚传统的咖啡仪式元素，一定会让顾客们更深入地了解咖啡文化。不过我得先好好练习一下阿姆哈拉语的发音才行。
[B]: How thoughtful of you to consider the authentic details! You know, the proper pronunciation of 'tena yistilign' - that's 'hello' in Amharic - can make all the difference. Perhaps we could collaborate on this event? Between your coffee expertise and our hotel's event space, we could create something truly special for coffee enthusiasts.
[A]: 听起来是个很棒的合作机会。我们店里有专业的烘焙设备，可以准备不同烘焙程度的埃塞俄比亚豆子供品鉴。等我把基本的问候语练熟些，我们再详细讨论活动方案如何？
[B]: Splendid idea! I'll make sure to reserve our conservatory for the event - the natural light there really enhances the coffee tasting experience. And don't worry about the language barrier, my dear. As we say in hospitality, warmth and enthusiasm translate beautifully in any language. Shall we meet next Tuesday over coffee to discuss further?
[A]: 好的，下周二见。我会带上我们新烘焙的耶加雪菲样品，到时候可以边品尝边讨论。对了，您知道埃塞俄比亚人喝咖啡时通常会搭配爆米花吗？这个细节或许能为活动增添些趣味。
[B]: How delightful! Yes, the popcorn tradition is such a charming part of their coffee culture - it represents hospitality and togetherness. We could serve it in traditional woven baskets... Oh, this is shaping up to be such a special event! Until Tuesday then - I'll have our pastry chef prepare some authentic Ethiopian honey bread to complement your Yirgacheffe samples.
[A]: 期待周二的会面。我会提前准备好咖啡豆的产地信息和风味笔记，相信这次合作能让更多人领略到埃塞俄比亚咖啡的独特魅力。
[B]: Wonderful! Your attention to detail is truly impressive. I can already imagine our guests savoring those exquisite flavors while learning about Ethiopia's rich coffee heritage. Safe travels until Tuesday - and do bring that enthusiasm of yours! It's absolutely contagious.
[A]: 谢谢您的肯定。那我们就周二见，到时候再详细交流活动细节。希望这次合作能让更多人爱上精品咖啡文化。
[B]: The pleasure is all mine, my dear! As we say in our profession, the best experiences are those that educate while they delight. I'm quite certain this will be one of those memorable occasions. Until Tuesday then - may your coffee be strong and your week be wonderful!
[A]: 您说得对，传播咖啡文化本身就是件令人愉悦的事。周二我会准时到访，带着我们对咖啡的热情和专业知识。祝您周末愉快！
[B]: What a perfect note to end on! Your passion is simply inspiring. I'll be counting the days until our meeting - and who knows, perhaps we'll start seeing more of these cultural coffee events in the future. Have a splendid weekend, and may your coffee experiments yield delicious results! Goodbye for now.
