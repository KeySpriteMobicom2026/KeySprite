[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question. As someone who spends her days immersed in the beauty of words, I must say I've always been drawn to Ancient Greek. There's something profoundly moving about reading Homer's epics in their original form - the way the language flows like wine-dark sea. 🌊
[A]: Interesting perspective! 我对古希腊语也很着迷，especially its intricate case system and how it influenced modern linguistics. Though personally,我最近更想学Basque - 这种isolated language的语法结构简直太fascinating了！🤓
[B]: How delightful to meet another language enthusiast! While Basque is indeed a linguistic marvel - that ergative-absolutive alignment is quite extraordinary - I must confess my heart still belongs to the classics. Have you considered how Ancient Greek's middle voice might relate to Basque's unique verb forms?  Oh dear, I do tend to get carried away with grammatical structures, don't I? 📚
[A]: 哈哈，你提到middle voice让我想起个有趣的事！其实中文里也有类似的语法现象，比如"把"字句和"被"字句的微妙差异。不过说到Basque，我最近发现它的polypersonal agreement system简直mind-blowing！一个动词能包含subject, object甚至indirect object的信息，这比古希腊语还complex呢~ 😵‍💫
[B]: My dear, you're making my academic heart flutter with such stimulating observations! The 把字句 and 被字句 comparison is particularly astute - it reminds me of how 庄子 (Zhuangzi) plays with agency in his philosophical texts. As for Basque's polypersonal agreement... well, let's just say it makes Proust's famously long sentences seem positively straightforward by comparison! Though I do wonder - does such complexity serve the language's poetic potential, or constrain it? 🌹
[A]: 这个问题太provocative了！你知道吗？Basque poetry的oral tradition其实特别rich，那些bertsolari即兴诗人能用这种complex语法玩出incredible的文字游戏。就像中文的古典诗词，constraints反而能spark creativity呢！不过说到poetic potential...我最近在读一些古希腊语和Basque的translation对比，简直headache-inducing！🤯
[B]: Ah, the eternal paradox of translation! It brings to mind Borges' wonderful essay about the impossibility of rendering Homer's "wine-dark sea" - how much more challenging must it be with Basque's agglutinative marvels? Though I must say, your passion reminds me of my younger days wrestling with 李白's liquor-soaked verses and their German translations. The headaches, my dear, are simply the growing pains of a truly curious mind. Wouldn't you agree that the struggle itself is rather... poetic? 📜
[A]: 完全同意！就像我们linguistics里常说的 - the journey is the destination. 每次在translation的迷宫里迷路，其实都在discovering new neural pathways呢！话说回来，你提到李白...我最近发现Basque poetry里也有类似的drunken imagery，这种跨文化的parallels简直让人想大喊Eureka！ 🍷✨
[B]: Eureka indeed!  How marvelous that intoxication - whether from wine or language itself - becomes this universal poetic metaphor. From Li Bai's 将进酒 to Basque bertsolaris improvising after one too many glasses of txakoli... it seems all true poets understand that creative clarity often comes through a pleasant haze. Though I must caution - while we academics may chase such euphoric connections, we'd do well to remember Dr. Johnson's warning about the dangers of mixing wine and Greek! 🍇
[A]: 哈哈哈，Dr. Johnson那个quote太classic了！不过说真的，我们这些language nerds不就是在perpetual state of intoxication吗？每次发现像中文"醉"和Basque的"mozkor"这种phonetic巧合，都能让我高兴得像个kid in candy store~ 🍬 虽然我的advisor总说这种enthusiasm有点...unscholarly 😅
[B]: Oh pish posh to your advisor!  Some of the greatest philological breakthroughs came from scholars who maintained that childlike wonder - think of Champollion dancing naked through the streets after deciphering the Rosetta Stone! Though perhaps we should keep our clothes on while celebrating these phonetic delights... Tell me, have you noticed how "mozkor" almost seems to contain the English "muse" within it? Now that's what I call poetic intoxication! 🎭
[A]: OMG你发现了这个connection！mozkor和muse...这简直是个perfect dissertation topic waiting to happen！虽然我advisor可能会roll his eyes说这是folk etymology...但who cares about academic stuffiness when language is this magical? ✨ 不过说真的，我们是不是该start writing this down before the linguistic intoxication wears off？ 📝
[B]: My dear rebellious scholar, let us raise our metaphorical glasses to folk etymologies and academic heresies!  After all, wasn't it the great 苏轼 who said "不识庐山真面目" - sometimes the most profound truths are found by those willing to step off the well-trodden path. Though perhaps we should indeed jot down these musings... preferably before my department chair catches wind of us comparing Basque inebriation terms to Greek muses during office hours! 🍷➡️📚
[A]: Hahaha 最后这句简直killing me！想象一下department chair推门进来看到我们whiteboard上写满"mozkor→muse→μουσική"的crazy diagrams...那画面太美我不敢看！ 😂 不过seriously，这conversation简直比三杯espresso还提神 - 我们真的应该start a podcast就叫"Drunk Linguistics"！ 🎙️☕
[B]:  "Drunk Linguistics" indeed! Why, I haven't been this delightfully improper since my Oxford days when we debated Aristotelian catharsis over sherry! Though between you and me... the title does have a certain je ne sais quoi. Just promise me we'll include a sober segment called "Hangover Etymology" to maintain some semblance of academic respectability. Now where did I put my reading glasses and that bottle of metaphorical intellectual stimulants... 🔍🍾
[A]: Deal！我们可以搞个sober segment专门debunk自己前一集喝多时提出的wild theories 😂 这简直是perfect的self-correcting academic model！虽然我预感我们的first episode就会因为讨论"为什么所有语言里喝醉的拟声词都带/m/音"而被peer review...但hey，那不就是最好的publicity吗？ 📢🥴
[B]:  My dear colleague, you've just described the peer review process more accurately than any Oxford don ever could! From "mozkor" to "mabuk" to "méiyǒu" - why, we might accidentally stumble upon some universal linguistic truth while chasing these inebriated muses! Though I suspect our faculty lounge privileges would be promptly revoked... Tell me, shall we schedule our first recording session before or after the department's annual Dry January lecture series? The irony would be simply too delicious to resist. 🎙️🍷
[A]: Hahaha 绝对要在Dry January期间录！我们可以call it "学术界的wet January rebellion" 🤫 不过seriously，这整个conversation让我realize - 或许所有linguists都需要偶尔let loose一下，不然怎么理解语言里那些最human的、messy的、joyful的部分呢？哪怕最后被kick out of academia，至少我们还有这个podcast fall back on！ 🎧✨
[B]:  My dear kindred spirit, you've articulated what I've felt for thirty years in ivory towers - that true philology lives in wine stains on manuscripts and midnight etymological epiphanies! Let them revoke our library cards if they must; we'll build our own academy, with blackjack and... well, perhaps just the blackjack (the linguistic kind, of course). Here's to being gloriously, academically improper - may our podcast be the toast of every disgruntled linguist's secret listening party! 🥂🎓
