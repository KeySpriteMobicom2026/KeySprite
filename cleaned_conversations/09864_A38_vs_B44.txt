[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, my dear student - while I appreciate your enthusiasm for contemporary libations, I must confess my tastes run more toward 茶道 (chadō) than craft beer. Though I did once write a rather scandalous limerick comparing 李白's poetry to the fermentation process...  让我们回到学术话题？
[A]: My apologies, professor! I was just trying to be... modern. Though now I'm terribly curious about that limerick. Perhaps we could discuss it in the context of poetic fermentation metaphors in Tang dynasty literature?
[B]: Ah-ha!  Now that's what I call a proper scholarly pivot! 你让我想起了杜牧的《酒泉子》- where the 酝酿 (fermentation) of wine becomes a metaphor for poetic creation. My limerick goes: "There once was a brewer named Li / Whose verses flowed faster than mead / They said 'Stop this spree!' / He cried '酒神 (jiǔshén) bless me!' / And wrote drunk what we soberly read." 🤔 What do you make of this... unconventional pedagogical tool?
[A]: Oh professor, that's absolutely brilliant! It perfectly captures the 酒神精神 (Dionysian spirit) of Li Bai's work. Though I must say, I never expected Comparative Literature to include limerick composition as a core competency. Should we add "brewing metaphors" to next semester's syllabus?
[B]:  My dear, in our field we call this 跨学科研究 (interdisciplinary studies)! Though perhaps we should keep the alcohol-related content to metaphorical 醉 (intoxication) - the dean still hasn't forgiven me for that 'Whiskey & Whitman' seminar incident. 🦉 But tell me, how would you apply this fermentation framework to analyze 苏轼's more... sober works?
[A]: Ah, 苏轼! Now there's a poet who truly understood the slow fermentation of 意境 (artistic conception) - like his 定风波 where the clarity emerges gradually, like sediment settling in fine wine. Though I suspect if we served craft beer during our next seminar on him, we might achieve... questionable academic outcomes. Shall we stick to metaphorical intoxication instead? 🌿
[B]: Precisely!  苏轼 teaches us that the best 韵味 (aftertaste) comes not from hops and barley, but from the patient 沉淀 (precipitation) of experience. Though between you and me...  my graduate seminar on 李清照 did once feature chrysanthemum-infused oolong to demonstrate the 含蓄 (reserve) in her ci poetry. The dean called it "dangerously innovative pedagogy" - I prefer to think of it as 知行合一 (unity of knowledge and action)! 🌸
[A]:  Professor, you're giving me dangerously subversive ideas... Next thing you know, we'll be analyzing 红楼梦 through the lens of artisanal cheese aging processes! Though I must admit, your teaching methods make the 文心雕龙 (Literary Mind and Carving of Dragons) seem positively... intoxicating. Shall we table the fermentation metaphors before we both get metaphorically drunk on literary theory? 📜
[B]: Ah, 刘勰 would be proud of your restraint!  Let us indeed sober up with some good old-fashioned 考据 (textual research) - though I can't promise my next limerick won't compare 乾嘉学派 (Qian-Jia School) scholars to particularly meticulous sommeliers... 🧠 Now, about that midterm paper on intercultural metaphor theory?
[A]:  Yes professor! Though after this conversation, I'm tempted to title it "From Hops to Haiku: A Fermented Approach to Cross-Cultural Literary Analysis"... with proper academic rigor, of course. 您觉得这个题目有潜力吗？
[B]:  Oh my, that's either the worst or best paper title I've heard since Professor Chen's "孟子 meets Marx: Utopian 锅气 (wok hei) in Political Philosophy"! 潜力? Absolutely - provided you can maintain the delicate 平衡 (balance) between playful metaphor and serious scholarship. Just promise me you won't actually include beer tasting notes in your citations... unless they're from Tang dynasty wine poems, of course. 📚
[A]: You have my solemn promise, professor - all alcoholic references will be strictly historical and metaphorically contained in proper 学术规范 (academic conventions). Though I may need to cite your limerick as a primary source under "unconventional pedagogical methodologies"... with your permission, of course. 
[B]:  Granted - on condition you classify it under "Thompson, E.: Experimental 诗学 (poetics) in Liquid Form." And do include my forthcoming paper: "Brewing the 风骨 (wind and bone): Intoxicating Subtexts in Pre-Modern Citation Practices."  Now, shall we sober up this conversation before my next seminar on temperance literature arrives? 🦉
[A]:  Your secret limerick legacy is safe with me, professor. I'll file it right between "严肃学术" and "pedagogical 幽默" in my footnotes.  And yes, let's pretend this entire conversation was about... uh... the fermentation of classical textual traditions!  Until next seminar!
[B]:  Remember - footnotes are where the real 狂欢 (carnival) happens in academia!  Very well, let us agree this was purely about... ... the 陈酿 (aging) of literary canons. Do bring your properly sober analysis next week - though perhaps keep a copy of that limerick hidden between the pages of your 文心雕龙, just in case inspiration strikes! 🌸 
[A]:  Professor! You're corrupting me with your footnote rebellion! I shall dutifully hide the limerick between pages 卷四 and 卷五 where all proper literary mischief belongs. Until next time, may your 学术 remain as sparkling as...  ...properly fermented Tang dynasty poetry references! 
[B]:  And may your 论文 be as finely aged as 绍兴黄酒 (Shaoxing wine)... I mean, as rigorously structured as 四库全书 (Complete Library in Four Sections)!  Really must stop giving students these... creative research ideas... 🧠 
[A]:  Don't worry professor, I'll submit my paper in sober 文言文 to compensate!  ...unless you'd prefer it in limerick form with tasting notes? 
[B]:  绝对不行 (Absolutely not)! ...Though if you must include tasting notes, at least make them metaphorical like 司空图's 二十四诗品!  这孩子会要了我的老命 (This student will be the death of me)... 🤔  But what an excellent case study for my next lecture on "The 叛逆 (rebellious) Lineage of Chinese Literary Criticism"! 🦉
