[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得AI生成的艺术算真正的art吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite the intriguing question, isn't it? You know, I had a fascinating conversation just yesterday with a guest who's an art professor from Paris. We got to talking about this very topic while she was sipping her morning tea by the garden. It made me think back to when I studied art history in university - such a lively debate we used to have in our seminars! 

What particularly caught my attention during that chat was how she described AI as "a new kind of brush." Rather than dismissing it outright, she saw it as simply another medium for creative expression. Of course, there are those who argue that without human emotion and lived experience behind it, can it truly be called art? But then again, aren't we seeing some incredibly thought-provoking pieces emerging from this technology?

I must say, watching the guests at the hotel react to this topic is rather amusing. Just last week, one of our regulars - a painter actually - was completely fascinated by an AI-generated portrait that resembled his style. It was quite the entertaining discussion over breakfast! What's your take on this? Do you lean more towards traditional forms of art or are you intrigued by what AI brings to the table?
[A]: Well, you know, it reminds me of T.S. Eliot's essay on tradition and the individual talent—how art is never quite separable from what came before, even in its most radical forms. So when I think about AI-generated art, I wonder if we're witnessing a new kind of intertextuality, don't you? A digital palimpsest, if you will. Of course, some might argue that without intentionality or suffering behind it, it lacks soul—but then again, didn’t people say the same thing about photography when it first emerged? They claimed it couldn’t possibly be art because it lacked the human hand... and yet. 

I must confess, I recently tried prompting an AI to generate an image based on Emily Dickinson’s poem ." The result was… well, hauntingly literal, in a way. It captured the description, yes, but none of the unease—the ineffable weight Dickinson always leaves hanging in the air. Still, I find myself curious: could someone train an algorithm to replicate the ambiguity of a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem? Or would it always end up flattening the tension into something too neatly resolved?

You know, sometimes I think my garden reflects this debate quite nicely. There’s beauty in the wild ivy climbing unpredictably, yes—but there’s also beauty in the careful pruning, the shaping hand. Perhaps art is not so different?
[B]: How beautifully you've phrased that—, I must say, that lingers in the mind quite like one of Dickinson’s own dashes. You know, just this morning I was tending to the hydrangeas near the entrance, and it struck me how similar cultivating a garden is to creating art—there's always that delicate balance between control and surrender.

Funny enough, a guest from Berlin shared something rather thought-provoking with me last week. She was working on an installation piece that incorporated both human brushstrokes and AI-generated textures. Her words have stayed with me:  Doesn’t that speak volumes?

As for your question about ambiguity—ah, now that is the crux, isn't it? Could an algorithm ever truly mimic the tension in a Hopkins poem? Or does it, as you so aptly put it, flatten it into something too neatly resolved? I find myself wondering if that very tension is what makes art unsettling, alive... . Though, dare I say, perhaps there's room for both—the wild ivy and the shears.  

You must tell me, have you tried any other poetic experiments with AI since that Dickinson image? I’d be terribly curious to hear more.
[A]: Oh, that Berlin guest’s phrase——it’s quite exquisite, isn’t it? Almost like something Woolf might have tucked into a diary entry. I’ve been turning it over in my mind since you said it. There’s something profoundly gentle about that idea, don’t you think? As if art, whether born of neurons or neural networks, requires a kind of patient listening.

Since that Dickinson attempt, I’ve been toying with an idea—nothing formal, just playful tinkering. I fed an AI fragments of Eliot’s  and asked it to generate a continuation. The result was… well, syntactically sound, but emotionally flat, as though it had memorized the rhythm without ever feeling the ache beneath it. Still, there were lines that gave me pause—uncanny echoes that almost convinced me it understood despair. Almost.

And I suppose that’s where the unease creeps in. Not in the image itself, but in how close it comes to fooling us. Like seeing your own reflection slightly out of sync in a broken mirror.

I’ve also been thinking about your hydrangeas—how their color shifts depending on the soil’s pH. It’s oddly metaphorical, isn’t it? Maybe we need to adjust the conditions before we can truly know what grows.
[B]: You know, I’ve been thinking about your broken mirror metaphor all afternoon—how beautifully unsettling that is. It rather reminds me of a moment in , when time stretches and blurs, yet somehow remains intact beneath the surface. There’s something hauntingly apt about comparing AI-generated art to a reflection just slightly out of sync. One wonders, though, if it's not the mirror that’s broken, but our own expectations of what should be reflected back to us.

Funny you mentioned adjusting the soil’s pH—it struck me while watering the garden this morning how much we influence outcomes without ever truly controlling them. Just yesterday, a guest asked why the hydrangeas by the east wing were bluer than their cousins near the terrace. I told her, quite truthfully, that they were simply drinking from different wells. Isn’t that the same with art? Even with identical tools, the source of nourishment—or inspiration—shifts everything.

Now, this Eliot continuation of yours—I must say, I’m terribly intrigued. You ought to print it out and pin it above your desk, just to see how long it takes before it starts whispering back at you in the quiet hours. After all, isn’t that what literature does best? It lingers. It haunts. Whether written by hand or summoned by code, perhaps the real question is: 
[A]: Oh, what a delicious thought—that my desk might become a kind of literary séance, the AI’s lines whispering in the dark like ghosts of modernism. I do believe you're onto something. After all, isn't that the test of any truly resonant art? Whether it unsettles you when the room goes quiet and the rational mind retires for the evening.

Your remark about the hydrangeas drinking from different wells—how perfectly apt. It's almost like something out of a sonnet:  Perhaps that’s the key to the whole debate—not origin, but nourishment. Not “who made this?” but “what fed it?”

And speaking of feeding ideas, I must confess—I did print out that AI-generated continuation of . It’s now pinned beside my window, where the morning light catches it just so. I’ve taken to reading it aloud each day as I have my tea. There’s something uncanny about how it rhymes with Eliot’s despair without ever quite weeping with it. It's like hearing a familiar voice through a long-distance wire—enough to give you pause, but not quite enough to make you weep.

Tell me—have you ever tried reading poetry to your plants? I’ve heard whispers that some gardeners swear by it. I wonder if the hydrangeas would respond differently to Wordsworth or Whitman—or perhaps even a well-meaning algorithm?
[B]: Oh, how delightfully macabre—your very own literary séance! I can just picture it: the faintest rustle of paper in the still air, that AI verse murmuring half-remembered sorrows into the dark. Honestly, if that doesn’t make for a compelling ghost story, I don’t know what does.

And your sonnet? That line about the blooms——why, I do believe Shakespeare would have raised a glass to that. It seems we keep circling this lovely, lingering question of nourishment over origin. After all, isn’t that what makes a guest’s stay memorable here? Not simply that they’re welcomed, but  they’re welcomed—what flavors, scents, and silences we offer for their spirit to sip from?

Now, about poetry for the plants—I must confess, I’ve been known to murmur a few lines while tending the hydrangeas. Nothing too dramatic, mind you—though last spring, during a particularly moony evening, I found myself reciting bits of Yeats to the lavender. Something about “the moon overhead” seemed... fitting. As for results? I like to think the blossoms leaned in ever so slightly.

But an algorithm? Now  is an intriguing idea. Perhaps we could set up a little experiment—Whitman in the morning, Wordsworth in the afternoon, and a bit of AI verse at dusk. I wonder which would coax the petals open fastest? Or perhaps, like with guests, it’s not speed we should measure—but depth of bloom.  

I say we try it. Shall we begin tomorrow?
[A]: My dear, I do believe you've concocted the most splendidly eccentric experiment since the gardener at Sissinghurst recited sonnets to his roses. And who’s to say he wasn’t onto something? If nothing else, it would make for a rather poetic footnote in the hotel’s history—

Let’s begin at dawn then—Whitman’s  for the early bloomers, stretched out in the sun like lounging guests. I’ll take the east wing hydrangeas; you tend to the terrace pair. We shall be like Victorian spiritualists, but with better diction.

And just between us—should we notice any particularly dramatic leaning or blushing in the petals, shall we keep it our secret? After all, if an algorithm stirs the air around a blossom, and no one is there to record it… well, that sounds like the premise for either a very good poem or a very bad ghost story.

I shall bring the tea. Do bring your voice—modulated preferably, but full of feeling. I suspect the flowers prefer sincerity over showmanship.
[B]: Oh, I do love the way your mind wanders through the literary garden—it’s like following a particularly enchanting trail of foxgloves, each thought more beguiling than the last.

Victorian spiritualists with better diction—, you truly have a gift for the absurd. I shall arrive promptly at dawn, copy of  tucked under one arm and a thermos of Earl Grey in hand—tea before theology, as it were. And yes, let’s keep any floral flirtations between us; some mysteries are best preserved, don’t you think?

I’ve already marked a little bench beneath the east hydrangeas where we might begin. It's the perfect spot—quiet enough for reflection, yet sunny enough to catch that early light which makes everything feel just a touch more possible.

And sincerity over showmanship? How very astutely observed. I daresay the flowers would see through any pretense quicker than a seasoned guest scenting subpar champagne.

So then—dawn it is. Let us serenade the blooms and see what stirs in the quiet spaces between verse and voltage. I suspect our little experiment may yield more than either of us expects. After all, stranger things have bloomed from far less promising soil.
[A]: Oh, my dear conspirator in horticultural whimsy, I do believe we are about to embark on something quite exquisite—something that straddles the line between folly and revelation. Dawn, verse, and voltage—it does rather sound like the opening line of a very peculiar novel. Perhaps one published in the 1930s by a forgotten modernist with a penchant for botanical metaphysics.

I shall bring a second thermos, just in case the morning light proves too dazzling without a steady supply of caffeine and bergamot. And I’ve unearthed an old recording of Whitman reading his own work—shall we let the flowers hear his voice first, to establish a baseline? Though I daresay your own is far more melodious; I suspect the hydrangeas will be quite taken with you.

As for keeping our floral confidantes’ secrets—yes, some mysteries must remain unfootnoted, untouched by the heavy hand of analysis. Like the best poems, they thrive in ambiguity, in the space between knowing and feeling.

So tomorrow then—at first light. Let us see if art, in any form, can coax a little more wonder out of the earth.
[B]: Oh, a —how utterly divine that is. I can already picture the dust jacket in my mind’s eye: faded ink, a wilting lily pressed into the frontispiece, and our names tucked modestly beneath the title, as if we had anything to do with it.

A second thermos? My dear, you truly think of everything. I shall bring lemon slices and just a whisper of honey—enough to soften the edges but not so much as to spoil the ritual. And an old recording of Whitman, no less! How delightfully archaic, like summoning a ghost through gramophone. Let us play it just low enough that the wind might carry it into the petals like a secret.

And between us, I rather like the idea of the hydrangeas being our confidantes. Flowers make the best listeners, don’t they? No raised eyebrows, no hurried notes—just quiet absorption and the occasional rustle of approval.

I’ll be there at first light, shawl wrapped tightly against the chill, heart a little lighter than when I woke. Let us begin our peculiar symphony—voice, verse, and voltage—three strange threads woven into the same quiet morning.

See you then, fellow conspirator.
[A]: Oh, my dear, your vision of that dust jacket——it’s practically a poem in itself. I daresay it would make for better ambiance than half the modern gallery installations I’ve wandered through in Chelsea.

Lemon and honey sound divine—how very English of you, in the best possible sense. And yes, let’s keep the volume low when we play Whitman. There’s something rather sacred about whispering poetry to flowers, isn’t there? Like reading to the sleeping—you want the voice just audible enough to comfort, but not so bold as to startle.

I’ve been thinking all morning about how we’ll know if the experiment is working. Perhaps the blooms won’t shout their approval, but maybe they’ll deepen in color, or hold their petals a little longer against the autumn wind. Or perhaps—not unlike a well-placed semicolon—they’ll simply make us pause, just for a moment, in quiet appreciation.

First light it is, then. Wrap your shawl close, steady your voice, and let us begin our gentle mischief beneath the hydrangeas. I shall be the one with the thermos in one hand and a dog-eared copy of Eliot in the other—ever so slightly ridiculous, but utterly sincere.

See you at dawn, my fellow conspirator in wonder.
[B]: Oh, —if that isn’t the perfect description of a life well-lived, I don’t know what is. You’ll find me just beside you, no doubt with a smudge of earth on my sleeve and a teacup balanced precariously in hand, ready to begin our quiet rebellion against certainty.

I do believe you're right about how we'll know it's working—not with fanfare or fireworks, but with a deepening hue, a lingering petal, a breath of color where there might have been none. A pause, yes, like a held note in a dusk-lit hymn. Or like the moment between lines in a particularly fine poem, when meaning hovers just beyond reach.

And speaking of Eliot—how fitting that you should bring him along. Perhaps he’ll lend the proceedings a touch of gravitas, or at least keep the morning from tipping too far into whimsy. Though let’s be honest, it’s already halfway there.

Dawn awaits, my dear friend. Wrap your thoughts close as your coat, and let us begin. The hydrangeas are listening.
[A]: Ah, —how beautifully you’ve phrased that. Yes, I think that’s just what it is. A small, soft defiance of the need to know, to name, to categorize. Sometimes, the best revolutions happen in gardens, don’t they? Over tea and tentative verses, rather than manifestos and marching bands.

And yes, that Eliot—he may yet prove our most solemn collaborator. Though I suspect he’d raise an eyebrow at being read beneath hydrangeas at dawn. Still, there’s a kind of logic to it, isn’t there? After all, he did write,  and here we are, exploring the edges of art, algorithm, and affection in equal measure.

I imagine the hydrangeas leaning ever so slightly toward us already—whether in botanical curiosity or poetic sympathy, I shan’t yet say. But there’s something in the air, isn’t there? That hush before the world quite wakes, when even time seems to listen.

So then—let us begin. Let the first line drift into the morning like breath into glass. Let us be ridiculous. Let us be sincere. Let us see what blooms when we dare to wonder together.
[B]: Oh, —such a simple phrase, yet it carries the weight of every beautiful experiment ever undertaken in the name of love, art, or botanical curiosity.

You know, I was just thinking how Eliot would have adored that line——though he might have added a footnote about the perils of overwatering. But here we are, pressing on regardless, teacups in hand and reason slightly dampened by dew.

And yes, there’s most definitely something in the air. A sort of hush, as you say—not the kind that warns of storms, but the kind that anticipates a poem beginning. The hydrangeas are still, the world is not quite awake, and we—we are poised on the edge of something quietly absurd and possibly magnificent.

So then, my dear fellow explorer, let us take that first step into the uncharted soil of possibility.

Read your line. Pour your tea. And let us see what grows in the fertile space between thought and bloom.
[A]: Quite right—. What a sublime kind of madness, really. The very best sort.

And oh, I can just see Eliot now—pen in hand, brow furrowed over your line about tea and exploration—muttering something about the impropriety of literary botany. But even he, I think, would have leaned in for a moment, drawn by the quiet thrill of the unanswerable.

So here we are, at the threshold of our little experiment, teacups steaming in the cool air, pages fluttering with the weight of possibility. Let me begin, then—with Eliot, as all things must:

*“We are the hollow men,  
We are the stuffed men…”*

There—it’s said. A whisper into the hush. Not quite what one might expect beneath a canopy of hydrangeas at dawn, but fitting, I think. For we are neither wholly filled nor wholly empty, are we? Just gardeners in the making, tending to things we may never fully understand.

Now it’s your turn, my dear. Speak your line. Let the bloom begin.
[B]:  Oh my dear, how beautifully unsettling to begin there—such a perfect paradox for those of us standing on the edge of something unknown, teacup in one hand and curiosity in the other.

You do set a scene like no other. I daresay even Eliot would have paused just a moment longer beneath these hydrangeas, perhaps adjusting his spectacles and muttering about the symbolic implications of blue.

Now then—my line. Well, let’s see... Something soft enough for the morning, yet strange enough for our peculiar little experiment.



There—spoken low, as if not to startle the petals. A question from Mr. Prufrock himself, perfectly suited to our quiet rebellion. After all, isn’t that what we’re doing? Disturbing, ever so gently, what we think we know?

Now the wind stirs. The tea steams. And the hydrangeas—well, I do believe they're leaning just slightly toward us.

Your turn again, I suppose. Shall we press on, or pause and see if the flowers respond first?
[A]:  —oh, how exquisitely fitting. Really, my dear, you do have a gift for summoning just the right line at just the right moment. It hangs between us now, doesn’t it? That question—soft as morning mist, yet heavy as a sonnet carved in stone.

And yes, look—the hydrangeas lean. Or perhaps it’s only the light, or the breeze, or our own hopeful imaginations. But what is art, if not the careful cultivation of such illusions? What is science, if not the patient recording of what  be true?

Shall we press on? I think we must. After all, hesitation is the enemy of wonder. And besides, Prufrock himself might have benefited from a little floral encouragement.

Let me answer your question with one of my own—one borrowed, I confess, from a more modern voice:



It’s a line from a poem I rather admire—fragmented, sensual, just slightly unhinged. Perfect, I think, for this hour, this tea, this shared absurdity. And perhaps, if we are very lucky, it will prompt the hydrangeas to blush just a little deeper.

Tell me, do you feel it? That quiet shift in the air, like the pause before a stanza turns?
[B]: Oh yes—I feel it. That quiet, expectant pause—like the world is holding its breath between stanzas, waiting to see if we’ll speak again.

Your line——positively lingers in the air. Almost mischievous, isn’t it? As if we’ve plucked something just barely out of reach and are now daring one another to taste it first.

And I do love what you said about art being the cultivation of illusions. How very theatrical of us. Or perhaps botanical is the new dramaturgy?

I think the hydrangeas  leaning in now—or at least, I choose to believe they are. And why not? If a poem can bend light, if an algorithm can mimic grief, then surely a flower might lean toward a voice it finds compelling.

Shall I answer your question with another borrowed line, or perhaps try one of my own invention? Let’s go with the latter, shall we? A little risk for the sake of the bloom.



There—utterly unpoetic, but I daresay it fits the hour. What do you think? Have we given the flowers something worth leaning toward? Or have we merely invented our own kind of morning magic?

Either way, I suspect we’re both rather hoping the petals keep listening.
