[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the age-old question of weathered moods. I find myself partial to rainy days - there's something profoundly literary about a steady drizzle against the windowpane. It invites one to linger over pages of Dostoevsky or Dickinson rather than rush through life's hurried chapters. Though I must confess, a sudden shaft of sunlight breaking through storm clouds does make for a rather perfect moment of catharsis, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective! ☕️ I actually see both sides as a coffee lover. Rainy days definitely set the mood for slow sipping and deep conversations - you know, like those moments when time seems to pause while your cup of Sumatra cools in hand. But then again, there's nothing quite like enjoying an iced Ethiopian on a sun-drenched patio, feeling the warmth through your bones. 

Funny thing is, my baristas always say rainy days bring out the most interesting customers - some looking for comfort, others chasing inspiration. It makes me wonder... do you think certain weathers actually shape our personalities? Like, are "rain people" fundamentally different from "sun people"? 🌿
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully brewed thought. I've often wondered the same while tending to my roses - do we choose our weather, or does it choose us? There's something rather Jungian about this idea, don't you think? A rainy disposition might cultivate introspection like moss on stone, while sunshine could carve personalities with the brightness of a sculptor's chisel. 

I recall writing a paper on atmospheric symbolism in Brontë novels once - how stormy weather always seemed to mirror rebellious spirits, and clear skies heralded emotional clarity. But perhaps we're all just walking contradictions. After all, even the most devoted rain person needs the occasional sunbeam to keep their shadows from growing too long.
[A]: You know, your words just made me adjust my brewing ratio of thoughts! ☕️ There's definitely something to this weather-personality alchemy. Funny you mentioned Brontë novels - I actually roast my beans differently depending on the forecast! On rainy days, I go for a darker roast, something that warms you from the inside out, like those stormy Heathcliff vibes. But when the sun's shining? Light & bright like a Jane Austen heroine - maybe a washed-process Ethiopian with bergamot notes.

I had a customer last week who swore she could taste more acidity in her coffee on cloudy days. We ended up testing it with a pH strip and... surprise surprise! Her perception was spot on! It got me thinking - are we all just walking barometers for emotions? Personally, I love how rain makes people order more cappuccinos - like they're subconsciously seeking warmth through microfoam clouds! 🌧️✨
[B]: Ah, what a delicious metaphor - and I do love a good microfoam cloud. There's something rather Proustian about how weather and taste intertwine, don't you think? The way certain atmospheric conditions call forth specific sensory cravings... 

I've noticed similar patterns in my students' essay submissions. On rainy days, the prose tends to swell with heightened romanticism - all brooding Byronic tones and Brontë-esque passions. But give them sunshine, and suddenly their paragraphs positively bloom with Impressionist light and Hemingway's crisp modern clarity.

Come to think of it, I might just adjust my lecture topics to match the forecast. A little meteorological determinism never hurt literary analysis - though I suspect my department chair would raise an eyebrow at such climatic pedagogy!
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language -浪漫ism with a side of气象学！ ☕️ You know what's funny? I started putting little weather icons on our menu board last year, just for fun. Now customers actually request "that brooding stormy day espresso blend" or the "sun-drenched Saturday morning pour-over." It's like we've turned coffee into a literary genre!

You mentioned Proust - reminds me of that madeleine moment. I swear, rain brings out the nostalgia in everyone. Last week a customer literally started reciting Wordsworth after tasting our Kenyan AA. And don't even get me started on how many proposals happen on sunny days by the window! 

I think your lecture idea is brilliant though - why not pair Camus' The Stranger with scorching heat? Or Jane Eyre with those drizzly autumn afternoons? Though honestly, I'd love to see your department chair's face during a thunderstorm literature unit! 😄
[B]: Oh, the literary barista concept is pure genius - you're practically crafting terroir with temperament! I can just imagine your café as a veritable Wuthering Heights of espresso... Though I must say, Camus in the heat does sound rather delicious. There's something about the relentless sun in The Stranger that presses down on the soul like a too-strong ristretto. 

And Jane Eyre with autumn drizzle? Perfect pairing. Though I'd argue for serving a spiced Chai during that unit - something to match the warmth of Jane's quiet defiance against her chilly circumstances. 

As for my department chair... last week he walked into my office while I was rearranging my lecture notes under a particularly dramatic thunderclamp outside. He actually paused mid-sentence and said, "Eleanor, must you always make the weather part of the syllabus?" To which I simply replied, "Only when it so generously volunteers itself as textual evidence."
[A]: Haha, I love how you said "terroir with temperament" - I might just steal that for my next menu description! ☕️ Though honestly, running a café is kind of like herding literary cats sometimes. You should see the debate we had last week over whether dark roast pairs better with crime novels or gothic poetry!

Oh my god, spiced chai with Jane Eyre? Brilliant! We actually do a special during our book club nights - match the beverage to the reading material. Last month someone brought in her dog-eared copy of Rebecca and suddenly our hallway smelled like a Manderley-inspired lavender latte! 

And your department chair story... priceless! Though honestly, if weather isn't counted as textual evidence in Romantic poetry classes by now, are we even teaching? Speaking of - we should totally create a "stormy romance" drink menu. Maybe something involving bourbon barrel-aged beans for those particularly tempestuous Brontë afternoons? 🌧️📖
[B]: Now you're speaking the true language of literary caffeination! I'm quite taken with this "stormy romance" menu concept - why, it practically demands a dramatic reading by candlelight. Bourbon barrel-aged beans sound positively perfect for those Brontëian tempests... though I might suggest serving them in smoked glass mugs to heighten the Gothic atmosphere, of course.

You know, I've often thought Heathcliff would have benefited greatly from a well-timed espresso service. Perhaps if Catherine had been offered a proper cappuccino during that fateful thunderstorm, they might have avoided all that unfortunate moor-wandering! 

I must say, your book club nights sound far more engaging than our faculty wine-and-cheese mixers. Last month's discussion of Frankenstein was frightfully dry - no amount of merlot could animate that conversation! Though I did try serving electrically-charged lemon drops... alas, my attempt at scientific refreshment was met with mostly puzzled looks.
[A]: Oh my god, smoked glass mugs? You just elevated coffee service to performance art! ☕️✨ I’m seriously considering dimming the lights and playing some Schubert's  on loop for atmosphere. And honestly, if Catherine had gotten her cappuccino fix that night, Wuthering Heights might’ve ended with a shared croissant instead of a ghostly showdown on the moors!

Your Frankenstein lemon drops sound... adventurous! 😄 Though maybe you were just ahead of the curve - I bet next year everyone will be chasing that "spark of life" in their drinks menus. Speaking of electricity, have you tried our cold brew served in copper cups? It’s like drinking a lightning storm in a glass - totally Victor Frankenstein approved!

But back to the book club nights - we actually had someone dress up as Madame Bovary last month while sipping our French press blend! She brought her own lace parasol and everything. I mean, how can faculty mixers compete with that kind of immersive experience? Maybe it’s time for your department to consider tenure by espresso tasting? 📚⚡
[B]: Oh,  and espresso – what a sublime collision of Gothic and caffeine! I think my students would forget all about their seminar papers if greeted by that ambiance. And just imagine - a croissant-based resolution to Wuthering Heights! Perhaps we could even serve them with blackberry jam to keep the moorland theme intact.

Now, this copper-cup cold brew of yours sounds positively alchemical. I must confess, I’ve been experimenting with temperature contrasts in my own teacup - though nothing so dramatic as lightning in glass. Victor Frankenstein would surely approve; perhaps it’s only a matter of time before we generate a caffeinated creature of our own in your café.

As for Madame Bovary in full regalia – brava! That is precisely the sort of literary devotion I strive to inspire in my lectures, though admittedly without the lace parasol. Though... now that you mention it, I do wonder how my colleagues would react if I strolled into department meetings wearing a bustle and quoting Flaubert. Might be worth trying, especially on those particularly dry budget discussions.

Tenure by espresso tasting? My dear barista-philosopher, you may have just solved academia’s most pressing dilemma. A single-origin Kenyan for clarity of thought, a Sumatran blend for depth of character... and perhaps a dash of bourbon-aged bitterness for tenure politics!
[A]: Ah, now you're writing my kind of syllabus! ☕️📚 I swear, if we team up, we could create the ultimate caffeinated curriculum - imagine midterm exams where students analyze Crime and Punishment while doing espresso shots! Though honestly, after your copper-cup alchemy talk, I'm seriously considering a mad scientist special on our menu. Maybe something with dry ice and a dash of absinthe for that extra literary hallucination effect?

And don't get me started on the bustle idea! We should totally do a "Dress Like Your Favorite Protagonist" day at the café. Last week someone came in dressed as Sherlock just to sip our "Pipe Tobacco Infused Blend" - which, by the way, was a customer's suggestion! 

Your academic cocktail menu is genius though. I think we need a tenure politics brew that tastes like burnt cinnamon and unreturned emails. Though between us? I'd gladly trade all my coffee beans for a front row seat to your first bustle-wearing department meeting. Just promise me you'll bring your Flaubert quotes and a healthy dose of Gothic drama! 😄🎭
[B]: Oh, the caffeinated curriculum is practically writing itself! Though I must say, your "mad scientist special" sounds far more enticing than any lab experiment I endured as an undergraduate. Dry ice and absinthe? Why not serve it in a glass shaped like Mary Shelley’s quill while we’re at it? I imagine students would suddenly find Gothic literature far more appetizing than their usual lukewarm lattes.

And this “Dress Like Your Favorite Protagonist” day? Pure brilliance! I’ve already begun drafting a guest list – Madame Bovary for the espresso bar, Hamlet brooding over black coffee, and don’t even get me started on what Mr. Darcy might order. Perhaps a single-origin Darjeeling with just a whisper of arrogance?

As for that tenure politics brew – burnt cinnamon and unreturned emails! Perfect. We could pair it with a side of red-ink stirred demitasse. And rest assured, my dear conspirator-in-caffeine, I shall make my departmental debut in full bustle regalia. Picture it: Flaubert quotes embroidered on my sleeve, a sprig of lavender behind one ear, and just enough Gothic drama to unsettle the dean himself. 

Now, when shall we begin our academic revolution? I suggest a Thursday – preferably rainy, of course.
[A]: Ah, you're speaking pure caffeinated poetry now! 🌧️📖 A Thursday it is - preferably one where the clouds hang low enough to touch the rooftops. I'm already sketching out the menu: 

☕  - a mysteriously dark roast that haunts the palate  
🍵  - with just the right amount of misplaced romantic enthusiasm  
🍷  - served at precisely midnight temperature  

And don’t even get me started on what we’ll play over the speakers—, featuring moody strings and thunderstorms on loop. 

I say we kick off the revolution with a dramatic reading of  by candlelight, but here’s the twist: every time Rochester says something broodingly inappropriate, patrons take a shot of spiced coffee liqueur. Should be... educational. 😄

Oh, and save the date – next full moon. Rumor has it Mary Shelley herself would’ve approved our methodology. Or at the very least, found it delightfully scandalous.
[B]: Oh, my dear revolutionary confederate, you’ve outdone yourself! The  sounds like something Poe himself might have imbibed between stanzas of melancholy verse. And  served at midnight temperature? I do believe the Count would rise from his coffin just for a sip – though he might be sorely disappointed to find it lacks a hint of iron!

I’ve already begun drafting the event flyer in suitably Byronic tones:  

And this shot-for-each-brooding-Rochester-line concept? Pure pedagogical genius, if a tad dangerous. One might end up with a very drunk and very passionate crowd by chapter twenty. Perhaps we should install a designated carriage driver for those who've overindulged in Brontëan spirits.

As for the full moon – Mary Shelley would surely applaud our audacity. I daresay she’d prefer her coffee stirred with a dash of lightning and served in a goblet once belonging to Victor Frankenstein’s ghost.

Now, shall we christen this gathering ? Or perhaps something more mysterious… ?
[A]: Oh, … I can already taste the intrigue! ☕️🌕 It’s got that perfect balance of caffeine and conspiracy - like a Dan Brown novel steeped in mystery. Though between us, I’m half-convinced someone will show up claiming to be Jack the Ripper’s long-lost bibliophile cousin by the third round of .

I love your flyer draft – though I think we should print it on parchment paper aged with tea stains and a touch of espresso residue for authenticity. And why not seal the invitation with crimson wax stamped with a moody raven holding a coffee bean in its beak? Pure gothic elegance.

Now, about transport... I may or may not have already spoken to a horse-drawn carriage company downtown. Let’s just say I have a very dramatic (and slightly theatrical) friend who owns a vintage carriage and believes every night should end with at least one near-romantic scandal.  

As for Mary Shelley’s ghost – I’ll make sure our espresso machine is tuned to perfection. If Victor Frankenstein's spirit drops by, I want him to leave with a new appreciation for life... and maybe a latte art heart that actually beats. 😄✨
[B]: Ah, parchment aged with tea stains and espresso residue – what a delightfully tactile form of literary foreplay! I can already imagine the guests running their fingers over the rough fibers, whispering,  And that crimson wax seal! The raven clutching a coffee bean – sublime. Perhaps we should issue a warning: 

A horse-drawn carriage? My dear barista conspirator, you've outdone yourself. I shall instruct my students to arrive in full Regency dress for extra credit – though I suspect only the boldest will accept. And your theatrical friend sounds like precisely the sort of person who belongs at our little soirée – preferably holding forth in the corner about ill-fated romances and misunderstood genius.

As for the beating latte art heart... well, if that doesn’t summon Mary Shelley’s ghost, nothing will. I suggest piping it with a drop of beetroot syrup – just enough to give it that freshly-stolen-from-the-heartbeat-of-genius glow.

Now, one final touch: let’s commission a secret cipher on the menu. A line from , perhaps, hidden in the pricing or ingredients – solvable only by those under the influence of both caffeine and passion. Shall we call it... ?
[A]: Oh, —you’ve just turned coffee ordering into a full-blown detective novel! 🕵️‍♂️☕ I’m already thinking of hiding clues in the foam art. Imagine—each latte reveals a letter, and only by following the trail of cappuccinos can one unlock the secret phrase. And yes, beetroot syrup for that "heart freshly torn from passion" glow? Chef’s kiss. Mary Shelley would swoon… or at least raise an eyebrow.

I may have  commissioned a local artist to sketch out a riddle in Gothic script for the menu board. Something about “the creature who gives warmth but never asks why.” The prize? A golden tamper engraved with a quill tip—and eternal literary fame, of course.

And your students in Regency dress? Genius. Though I must warn you—I might show up as Mr. Rochester myself, minus the attic drama but with all the brooding charm (and maybe a well-timed sigh over the espresso machine).

Now, shall we send out the first ciphered teaser on black-edged postcards, signed only with a single coffee bean and the words:  ? 😄📖
[B]: Oh,  – deliciously ominous! I can already hear the rustle of curiosity as recipients turn that black-edged card in their hands, whispering,  It's positively Dickensian – or perhaps Lovecraftian, depending on how much absinthe we've dosed the brew with.

Your cappuccino cipher idea is nothing short of barista noir brilliance. A letter per foam swirl – why, patrons may begin haunting our café like detectives at a crime scene, chasing down plotlines in their cups. I do hope someone faints dramatically upon discovering the final clue. Perhaps we should keep smelling salts behind the counter, just in case.

And that riddle – “the creature who gives warmth but never asks why” – sublime misdirection! They’ll be scratching their heads over coffee rings for days. Though I suspect your artist may have slipped in a few diabolical flourishes – Gothic script does love to obscure meaning behind ornate curves.

As for you appearing as Mr. Rochester – I shall raise my bustled skirts in salute. Just promise me no real fire will break out this time. We can ill afford another Thornfield incident, especially if the health inspector makes an unannounced visit.

And now, my dear co-conspirator, shall we draft the teaser together? I suggest ink smudged ever so slightly, as though written in haste by a trembling, caffeine-deprived hand. Something like:

> *“Midnight approaches. The manuscript stirs.  
> Come taste what was never meant to be brewed.”*

Shall we send it under cover of darkness… or at least a well-timed cloud passing before the moon?
