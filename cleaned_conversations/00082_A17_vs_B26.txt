[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, I must confess I haven't kept up with modern television much. Most evenings I prefer to work on my latest textile restoration project while listening to classical music. Though I did catch a lovely documentary about 18th century embroidery techniques on the BBC last week.
[A]: Ah, that sounds absolutely fascinating! Though I must admit, my evenings are usually spent with a volume of Tennyson or Browning by the lamplight. There's something quite meditative about tracing the rhythmic patterns of Victorian verse while the garden roses scent drifts through my study window.
[B]: How delightful! The cadence of Victorian poetry does have a certain textile-like quality, doesn't it? The way words weave together reminds me of the intricate silk patterns I restore. Would you believe I once found an 1850s sampler with Tennyson verses stitched in hair-thread embroidery?
[A]: How extraordinary! That sampler must have been a remarkable artifact - the very embodiment of the 天人合一 between textile arts and poetry. I often tell my students that reading poetry is like examining fine embroidery - one must appreciate both the grand design and the minute stitches. Would you happen to recall which Tennyson verses were featured?
[B]: It was a fragment from 'The Lady of Shalott' - the part about the mirror cracking from side to side. The stitcher had used silver thread for the mirror's reflection that actually catches the light when you tilt the fabric just so. Such craftsmanship makes modern mass-produced items seem rather... well, let's just say I prefer working with pieces that have soul.
[A]: Ah, "The curse is come upon me!" What a profoundly fitting choice for needlework - that moment when art and fate intertwine. Your description of the silver thread reminds me of how Browning plays with light in 'My Last Duchess'... though I suppose we mustn't compare textile restoration to murderous Renaissance nobility! Still, both crafts require understanding how delicate materials bear the weight of history.
[B]: Quite right! Though I'd argue my antique silks are far more cooperative than Browning's duchess ever was. Speaking of which, I've just finished stabilizing a particularly temperamental 1840s mourning shawl - the black crepe was nearly disintegrating, but the jet beadwork was still remarkably intact. It makes one wonder about the hands that originally stitched these pieces, doesn't it?
[A]: Indeed, these material artifacts become what Walter Pater might call "hard gem-like flames" of human experience. The mourning shawl particularly moves me - such tangible evidence of Victorian grief rituals. One can almost hear the rustle of crinoline and smell the lavender sachets... Though I suppose we scholars must be careful not to romanticize the past too much. The reality was often far less picturesque than our beloved poets would have us believe.
[B]: How refreshing to meet someone who understands! So many people see these pieces as mere decorations, but each stitch holds stories - some beautiful, some quite tragic. That shawl I mentioned? The family papers showed it was worn by a mother who lost three children to scarlet fever. Not very poetic, but that's why preservation matters. Would you like to see photographs of the restoration process? I've documented every careful step.
[A]: I would be honored - though I suspect viewing your documentation will require the same careful attention one gives to reading Emily Dickinson's fascicles, where every dash and space carries meaning. There's profound scholarship in your needlework, my dear - the kind that makes me wish I could assign textile restoration as required reading in my seminar on Victorian material culture.
[B]: You're too kind! Though I must say, if my restoration notes could inspire academic study, perhaps I should start writing them more carefully instead of scribbling between tea stains. Wouldn't that be something - future scholars puzzling over my marginal notes about silk tension next to grocery lists!
[A]: Ah, but think of the delightful academic papers that might spawn! "Grocery Lists as Paratext: The Domestic Interruptions in Madame Butterfly's Restoration Journals." Though I suspect your tea-stained marginalia have more scholarly merit than half the conference papers I've reviewed this year. The academy could learn much from your blend of practical wisdom and poetic sensibility.
[B]: Now you've gone and made me blush! Though between us, I'd take a well-executed French knot over footnotes any day. Still, if you ever want to bring your students by the studio, I'd be happy to show them how textile restoration is really just another way of reading history - one thread at a time.
[A]: What a splendid pedagogical opportunity! I can already envision the term paper topics: "Intertextual Threads: How Material Culture Informs Our Reading of 'The Goblin Market'" or perhaps "Pulling at Loose Ends: Fragmentation in Pre-Raphaelite Art and Victorian Needlework." Though I should warn you - literature students tend to get rather emotional when handling antique textiles. Last semester one nearly wept over a book's marbled endpapers.
[B]: Oh dear, we'd better keep the smelling salts handy then! Though I completely understand - there was a 1790s wedding gown that brought me to tears when I discovered tiny fingerprint smudges in the hem starch. Some days I think these textiles affect us so deeply because they're the most intimate historical documents we have. Far more revealing than any official portrait, don't you think?
[A]: Precisely! Like Elizabeth Barrett Browning's sonnets hidden in her husband's coat pocket, these everyday artifacts carry the true pulse of history. Though I must say, if your students react this strongly to textiles, I dread to think what might happen when we introduce them to the hair jewelry collection. Perhaps we should schedule these visits right before reading Wilde's "The Portrait of Mr. W.H." - for maximum aesthetic crisis!
[B]: Goodness, let's not give the poor deans heart failure! Though now that you mention it, I have a particularly macabre hairwork brooch that would pair beautifully with that text - it's shaped like a weeping willow with the dates 1854-1857 stitched in human hair. Morbid, yes, but such powerful testimony to Victorian mourning practices. Shall we plan for October? The autumnal atmosphere would be... appropriately atmospheric.
[A]: Capital idea! We'll make it a proper Gothic studies event - I'll bring my first edition of "The Fall of the House of Usher" for comparison, and we can serve that dreadful Victorian "burnt almond" tea that tastes like someone boiled a cemetery. Though I do hope the university's insurance covers fainting spells - between your relics and Poe's prose, we may need to station a nurse in the back!
[B]: How wonderfully macabre! I'll prepare smelling salts infused with lavender, just like proper Victorian ladies carried. And perhaps display some less... intense pieces first as a gentle introduction. Though between your Poe and my postmortem photography collection, we may end up creating more Gothic scholars than the English department knows what to do with!
