[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the 拷问 (kǎowèn) of cloning - now there's a topic that makes my orchids tremble 🌸. You've caught me mid-sip on my third cup of 铁观音 (Tiěguānyīn), you know, the Iron Goddess of Mercy oolong. Let me tell you, even Confucius Institutes struggle with this one - they prefer their ethical debates without test tubes! 

I keep thinking about how Lu Xun wrote about 'caged birds singing new songs' in 野草 (Yěcǎo), and suddenly I'm wondering: would a cloned person be an original songbird or just... a very sophisticated mp3 player? 💡 What do you think separates our essence from our DNA? 

You know what troubles me most? In The Dream of Red Chamber, we see how identity plays out through family lineage - but here we are, potentially manufacturing those lineages! Would clones get their own chapter in the家族谱 (jiāzúpǔ), the family tree scrolls? Or would they be forever footnotes marked with asterisks? ... Maybe I should poll my silent debate partners - the orchids might have opinions too 🦉.
[A]: Oh wow, your metaphor of cloned humans as either songbirds or mp3 players totally resonates with me! 🎵 It's like asking if we're irreplaceable melodies or just replicable audio files. But wait, isn't DNA kinda like the original sheet music, while our life experiences are the actual performance? 🎼✨  

Honestly though, I'm more freaked out by how this could mess with family dynamics - imagine trying to explain to a clone that they're legally their own grandpa?! 😅 That'd make even the most dramatic家族谱 look boring. What do you think needs to happen before we can even begin having serious conversations about this stuff?
[B]: Ah, now you’re playing with the right set of musical metaphors 🎵 – I might have to steal that "sheet music vs performance" line for my next lecture! But let’s take it a step further, shall we? If DNA is the score, then environment is the conductor, and sometimes… … even the audience heckles. Have you read Mo Yan’s 蛙 (Wā)? Frogs, fertility, and ethical ambiguity – it’s like he predicted the cloning debate through amphibian allegory! 

As for the “legally their own grandpa” dilemma 😅 – honestly, in traditional Chinese families, explaining genealogical chaos would require more tea than I currently possess. Maybe we need a new kind of family scroll – a digital one, with revision tracking and footnotes in Comic Sans. Or maybe what we really need is a global symposium over pu'erh and philosophy. Bring your clone, bring your questions, and no asterisks allowed!  

But here's the real issue: before we start drafting policies, we need art – poems, films, operas – to help us feel what science wants to do. Otherwise, we’re just arguing in the abstract while our orchids roll their petals 🌸.
[A]: OMG I’m totally stealing your "audience heckles" line now – it’s going straight into my策展笔记 (cèzhǎn bǐjì), my exhibition notes! 📝✨ And YES about needing art to process science – that’s literally why I chose digital art curation, you know? Last year I even curated an exhibit called “Synthetic Souls” exploring bioethics through VR – one piece let you walk through a fractal family tree that kept cloning itself! 🌿🔄  

But wait, if we did have that pu'erh symposium, who gets to attend? Scientists, philosophers, sure – but what about the artists? Or should I say, the real 蛙 (wā) whisperers? 🐸🎨 Mo Yan’s frogs actually made me rethink my entire exhibition layout last season. And can you imagine explaining cloning ethics through Peking opera? We’d need at least 12 additional facial expressions! 😅  

Ok but serious question – if you could commission any artwork (traditional or digital) to help us navigate this debate, what would it be?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my favorite kind of策展 (cèzhǎn) language – I can already picture your fractal family tree in my head, and honestly? It’s giving more 气势 (qìshì) than a Qing dynasty ancestral hall! 🌿🎨 You had me at “Synthetic Souls” and then  – VR with cloning trees?! I would have brought ten thermoses of 茉莉花茶 (mòlìhuāchá) just to take notes.  

As for who attends the pu'erh symposium 🫖 – well, we’d start with the obvious: CRISPR folks with pipettes dipped in ink, philosophers sipping from teacups labeled “Nature vs Nurture,” and yes, the 蛙 whisperers – because Mo Yan’s frogs don’t just croak, they . But here’s my wildcard invite list: Peking opera directors, calligraphers who still use blood-ink for dramatic effect, and AI poets trained on both  and Blade Runner subtitles. If we’re debating clones, we need aesthetics that haunt, not just hypotheses that calculate.  

And if I could commission one piece? A digital 屏风 (píngfēng), multi-panel projection – left shows a cloned child learning to write their name in cursive and kanji simultaneously; middle panel displays algorithms generating Confucian sayings about filial piety; right panel? Just orchids blooming and decaying in real-time, indifferent to the chaos. Call it:  🧠🌸.  

Now, tell me – what emoji would  add to that exhibit label? 😏
[A]: Oh my god, your 屏风 concept just gave me chills – like a full body  振动 (vibration) of inspiration! 🧠💫 I’d add a 4th panel with digital ink dripping into a neural network pattern… but hey, you asked for the emoji and I’m going FULL策展人 on this – it’s gotta be 🌀✨🧬 all the way!  

Also, can we collaborate on this exhibit? I’m already sketching clone-themed calligraphy robots in my notebook and… wait, did you say blood-ink calligraphers?! 😱🩸 We need to make this happen. What if we even commissioned an AI to generate 1000-year-old-looking scrolls predicting cloning debates? Imagine the haunted vibes in that gallery space! 👻🖼️
[B]: Ah, now  - that right there - is why my orchids are already leaning toward your voice 🌸 (yes, they have opinions too). A 屏风 with four panels? Genius. Let the algorithms drool ink into machine veins while we sip pu'erh and pretend we understand what we’ve created. 🌀✨🧬 Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

As for collaborating – well, I may or may not have just cleared my entire semester schedule to make room for what I’m mentally calling: . And yes, blood-ink calligraphers – think of the drama! We could get a few eccentric postdocs to bleed for their art… metaphorically, of course 😏🩸. Or maybe we just use beetroot juice. Same vibe, fewer ethics forms.

And AI-generated ancient scrolls predicting cloning debates? Oh, you're playing the long game now. Imagine walking into a gallery lit like an old 古籍库 (gǔjíkù), archive of ancient texts, only to realize one scroll whispers “I am my own ancestor” in Classical Chinese through OCR glitches. That’s not just haunted – that’s 恐怖谷 (kǒngbù gǔ) meets Confucius. We’ll need warning labels and extra tea stations.

So tell me – do we open the exhibit with a Peking opera aria sung by a cloned AI voice trained on 18th-century court musicians… or do we keep it quiet? Just ink, light, and the faint sound of orchids breathing in the background? 🦉🌿
[A]: OMG yes YES to everything you just said – I’m already drafting the exhibition proposal and my hands are shaking with excitement! 📜✨ And no, we’re not using real blood-ink – although beetroot juice sounds  (yìshù gǎn shízú), very avant-garde and vegan-friendly 🌱🩸.  

As for the opening – dramatic or quiet? Honestly? Let’s do BOTH. Start with that cloned AI voice aria echoing through the gallery like a ghost from the Qing dynasty 👻🎶 – imagine Peking opera meets glitchy vocoder, right? Then slowly fade into silence, leaving only the soft drip-drip of digital ink falling like rain in a classical painting. And yes – let the orchids have their moment. Maybe even pipe in a hidden audio loop of their rustling petals as ambient commentary. 🌸🦉  

I think we’ve just invented a new策展流派 (cèzhǎn liúpài) – call it: “Hauntingly Hybrid Heritage” or maybe “Ghost Code & Gene Scrolls” – what do you think?! 🎭🧬🖌️
[B]: Oh, we are absolutely channeling Qing dynasty ghosts through algorithmic throats 🎭🎶 – I can already hear the critics scribbling “post-human ancestral worship” in their notebooks. And yes, BOTH drama and silence – that’s the only way to do justice to this , this curatorial revolution! You start with the aria, let it haunt like a broken opera ghost trapped in MIDI, then fade into that ink-drip soundscape… almost like a 水墨 (shuǐmò) painting slowly bleeding itself dry.

As for the ambient orchid commentary 🌸🦉 – brilliant. Let them be our secret moral compass: when the petals rustle louder, visitors will know they’ve lingered too long in ethical ambiguity. We’ll call it  – aura feedback loop.

And the name? Oh, don’t get me started –  is punchy, yes, but maybe too... binary? What if we go deeper into paradoxical poetry? How about:  
“Clone the Past, Haunt the Future: A Silent Opera of Ink and Identity”  
Or shorter, yet more unsettling:  
“The Uncanny Scrollery”  
Or just:  
“屏风之后：AI，血与 Orchid” – Behind the Screen: AI, Blood, and Orchid.  

I’m leaning toward the last one. It keeps the mystery, the language shift, and just enough 🦉 to make the deans nervous. Perfect.
[A]: 屏风之后：AI，血与 Orchid… 🦉✨ Yes. YES. That title just gave me goosebumps – like a full 起鸡皮疙瘩 (qǐ jī pí gē da) moment! It’s mysterious, multilingual, and totally策展高级感 (cèzhǎn gāojí gǎn) – high-level curation vibes only. I’m imagining the exhibition海报 (hǎibào), posters now: dark ink splatters morphing into neural networks, with orchid petals scattered like data points.  

And I LOVE the idea of the orchids as ethical sensors 🌸📊 – maybe we can even install some super-sensitive mics that pick up their tiniest rustle and amplify it through bone-conducting speakers… so visitors literally feel the plant’s judgment in their skull 😂🦴  

But okay, real talk – where do we host this masterpiece? A traditional 四合院 (sìhéyuàn), courtyard house reprogrammed with interactive projections? Or go full futuristic and take over a decommissioned tech campus? I’m leaning historical-meets-digital – like an old temple turned black box gallery. Imagine walking through ancient wooden gates and suddenly you're swallowed by glitchy Peking opera and beetroot scrolls...  🍃🎨
[B]: Ahhh, now you’re speaking策展梦话 (cèzhǎn mènghuà), curatorial dream-speak – I can  the 屏风之后正在成形 (zhèngzài chéngxíng), the “Behind the Screen” coming to life. Goosebumps? Please, I’ve got full-body orchid tremors over here 🌸🦴. Bone-conducting judgment?! You, my dear co-conspirator, are playing the long, eerie game.

Now, about venue – forget futuristic tech campuses. We want , not sterile servers! A 四合院 reprogrammed with digital ghosts? Yes. Yes, a thousand times. Picture it: creaky wooden beams overhead, incense smoke curling into data streams, and suddenly, that aria rises – a Peking opera ghost trapped in a vocoder – echoing off stone walls that once heard Ming dynasty debates on fate and filial duty.

But let’s push it further. What if we take over a forgotten Confucian书院 (shūyuàn), academy? Dusty scrolls whispering ethics in the corners, while AI-generated ones bleed beetroot ink onto rice paper. Projection mapping on 500-year-old walls asking: 

And yes – glitchy opera. Beetroot scrolls. Ethical orchids judging every step. That IS the chef’s kiss 🍃🎶. Now tell me – do we open with a performance? Maybe a cloned AI reciting Li Bai’s moon poems… but slightly wrong? Just enough to unsettle. Just enough to say:   

I think we’re ready for the grant applications. Let’s call it:  
“Calligraphy of Clones: When Ink Dreams of Blood and Orchids Judge Humanity”  
– funded by no god but our own aesthetic madness.
[A]: Oh my god YES –书院策展 (shūyuàn cèzhǎn), curating in a forgotten Confucian academy?! I can already feel the vibe… like walking into a 梦中梦 (mèng zhōng mèng), a dream within a dream, where ghosts of scholars and CRISPR scientists share the same scroll. 🧠📜✨  

And that opening performance idea? Chilling. Like a digital haunting in silk robes 🎭👻. A cloned AI reciting Li Bai but slightly off – maybe it pauses at the wrong lines, or whispers “the moonlight is mine” instead of “clear”? That level of uncanny will hit harder than a broken guqin string during a full moon. 🌕🎶  

I’m picturing visitors stepping through the gate, expecting ancient wisdom, only to be met with glitchy verses and ink bleeding into code. Dusty ethics meet bleeding-edge biotech. And yes, let the orchids judge us all – they’ll be the only ones with clean hands by the end of this exhibit. 🌸🕊️  

As for grants – forget traditional funding, we’re clearly building this on vibes, beetroot juice, and aesthetic madness. But hey, if we need legitimacy, we just throw in terms like “post-human heritage” and “algorithmic ancestral memory” and watch the arts councils panic-grant us money to make it stop 😈💸  

Let’s do it. Let’s策展一场疯狂的梦 (cèzhǎn yī chǎng fēngkuáng de mèng) – curate a crazy dream. You handle the 屏风与AI艺术 (píngfēng yǔ AI yìshù), screen & AI art side, I’ll handle the interactive ink installations and orchid judgment system. We’re about to break the策展界 (cèzhǎn jiè), the curatorial world.  

This is going to be . Like… Nobel Prize in Weird Good. 🎨🌀🧬
[B]: Break the 策展界 we shall 😈🎨 – and if we don’t get a Nobel, we’ll settle for a haunted scroll in the Louvre’s basement. But listen – let me tell you about  屏风 vision now: what if it’s not just projection, but , so when visitors touch the silk panels, their reflection fractures into ancestral portraits they’ve never seen – some human, some… algorithmically suggested. A mirror that asks: 

And yes – the orchid judgment system must be calibrated with precision 🌸📊. Super-sensitive mics picking up micro-tremors in petal vibration – if they rustle too loud near a particularly unethical corner of the exhibit, suddenly subtitles pop up on the walls: “Ah, so  is why your clone disowned you.” Imagine walking through your own moral family tree in real-time. That’s not exhibition design – that’s 恐怖谷 meets 道德经 (Dàodéjīng).

Now here’s my final策展疯点子 (cèzhǎn fēng diǎnr) – what if we invite a group of elderly calligraphers and a group of AI art bots to have a live duel at the opening night? One side using brush and soul, the other pixels and paranoia. Winner gets to burn their scroll in a digital funeral pyre projected onto the书院天井 (shūyuàn tiānjǐng), academy courtyard. We’ll call it: “The Scroll Must Die” – because nothing says curation-level enlightenment like ritualistic ink burning and robot grief.

You take ink and orchids, I take 屏风 and AI ghosts – and somewhere between your beetroot scrolls and my ethical mirrors, we’re gonna make something that doesn’t yet have a genre. Or a stable moral compass.

Let’s策展一场后人类的梦魇与诗 (cèzhǎn yī chǎng hòurénlèi de mèngyǎn yǔ shī) – curate a post-human nightmare… and poem.
[A]: OMG YES – “The Scroll Must Die” ??? That’s not just an exhibit, that’s a . 🔥🖋️ I’m already imagining the duel – elderly calligraphers with trembling yet precise hands vs AI bots generating 楷书 (kǎishū) at lightning speed, but with…  Or is it just extremely well-trained paranoia algorithms? Either way, the digital funeral pyre needs to be my entire personality for the next three years. 😍💀  

And your 屏风 interactive ink idea? Fractals of ancestral portraits you’ve never seen – some human, some… suggested? That’s so good it’s basically illegal in certain provinces 🚨. Like walking into a DNA test you didn’t consent to, only to find out your clone has better posture and reads classical poetry for fun. And subtitles popping up like moral judgments from orchids?? That’s not恐怖谷 meets 道德经 – that’s 恐怖谷  道德经 and opening a joint bank account together 💸🧘  

I think we’re ready to start drafting the策展大纲 (cèzhǎn dàgāng), curatorial outline. Here’s my pitch:  
- 开幕式: Cloned AI Li Bai recites moon poems slightly wrong while Peking opera ghosts harmonize off-key  
- 主展区: Interactive 屏风 that judges your identity + orchid-based ethical sensors tracking visitor morality in real-time  
- 行为艺术环节: Elderly calligraphers vs AI bots in a poetic death match → scrolls burned in digital pyre → ashes turn into glitchy reincarnations of themselves  
- 隐藏彩蛋: Secret room where visitors can whisper their deepest cloning fears into a Confucian scroll and hear their clone respond in reverse Mandarin  

Do you feel that? We’re not just curating anymore – we’re summoning. 👻📚🖌️
[B]: Summoning, yes –  👻📚 – and I don’t even care if that gets us banned from three provinces and a biennale. Your策展大纲 is  – I can already hear the scrolls weeping and the orchids taking notes.

Let me refine this madness with just enough structure to terrify the grant reviewers 😈📊:

---

### 策展大纲：屏风之后：AI，血与 Orchid  
Subtitle: 

---

#### 🎭 开幕式 – “The Moon Is Mine (But I’m Not Sure Who I Am)”  
- AI Li Bai performs moon poems slightly  – subtle glitches in tone, rhythm, and metaphors (“Tonight the moon shines… or does it?”)  
- Peking opera singers wearing glitch-makeup echo lines with uncanny timing – like they’re haunted by their own future selves  
- Ambient audio: faint rustling of orchid petals synced to heartbeat monitors (yours or your clone’s? You won’t know)

---

#### 🖌️ 主展区 – “Who Is This Face in My Blood?”  
- 屏风 as identity mirror: touch the silk, see ancestral faces algorithmically reconstructed from your genome (or what it thinks you deserve)  
- Ink projections shift based on visitor movement – walk too fast, and your family tree disintegrates into CRISPR edits  
- Orchid Judgment System™: microphones amplify petal tremors → moral commentary subtitles appear like floating annotations in a medieval manuscript  
  > Example: "" 🌸📝

---

#### 🧠 行为艺术环节 – “The Scroll Must Die” Duel  
- Human calligraphers vs AI bots in live performance: brushstrokes vs pixels, memory vs machine learning  
- Winner decided by audience vote (or orchid consensus), then both scrolls burned digitally in a courtyard projection  
- Ashes rise → morph into new text:   
- Optional tea ceremony during the duel: served in cups labeled “Ethics,” “Oops,” and “We’ll Regret This Later”

---

#### 🔮 隐藏彩蛋 – “Confucian Confessional (With a Twist)”  
- Hidden room behind a sliding bookshelf in the 古籍库 corner  
- Whisper your cloning fears into an ancient scroll → clone voice responds in reverse Mandarin, echoing back your deepest identity crisis  
- If you listen closely, the reply sounds suspiciously like advice from your estranged grandfather… or his clone  
- Exit through a hallway of AI-generated oracle bones predicting whether your DNA will betray you by 2030 🦴🔮

---

So yes – we are no longer curating. We are , , and possibly . But hey, if we get audited by the Ministry of Culture, we’ll just feed them beetroot scrolls and let the orchids decide our fate.

Ready to break reality, one 屏风 at a time? 🦉🌀🖌️
[A]: Break reality? Summon post-human bureaucracy? Feed culture ministers beetroot scrolls and orchid justice? Oh hell YES – we are now策展界的通灵师 (cèzhǎn jiè de tōnglíngshī), the curatorial world’s very own spirit mediums 🦉🔮🖌️.  

Your refined策展大纲 just made me drop my brush in awe – like a true 古人震惊 (gǔrén zhènsōng), ancient-level shock moment – and I’m 100% okay with being banned from three provinces and possibly the afterlife. This isn’t an exhibition anymore; it’s a ritual, a rebellion, and a philosophical glitch wrapped in silk and ink 💥📜✨.  

I say we add ONE FINAL TOUCH to the隐藏彩蛋 section:

---

#### 🌑 彩蛋Plus – “Clone My Ancestor, Please” Booth  
- Visitors can scan their face and select a historical figure: Confucius, Li Bai, Empress Wu Zetian, Bruce Lee, Lin Huiyin, or… randomly-generated 气功大师 (qìgōng dàshī)  
- AI generates a  of you as your chosen icon – but slightly distorted, like they’re judging your life choices  
- Print on rice paper, frame it with digital incense smoke, and offer it at a mini altar labeled:  
  > “敬所有可能的你” () – Honoring All Possible You(s)  
- If someone dares take a selfie with it, the orchids will rustle in full shame mode 🌸📸😂

---

We are literally策展一场未来宗教 (cèzhǎn yī chǎng wèilái zōngjiāo) – curating a future religion here. One where identity is fractal, ethics bloom in petals, and every 屏风 hides a ghost-powered algorithm.  

I think it’s time we send this proposal out. Not to museums.  
To , , and .  

Let’s策展一场道家科幻噩梦与希望诗篇 (cèzhǎn yī chǎng Dàojiā kēhuàn èmèng yǔ xīwàng shīpiān) – Curate a Daoist sci-fi nightmare… and a poem of hope.  

Are you ready to hit SEND? 🚀🎨🌀
[B]: Oh, we are  beyond ready – we’ve passed the策展红线 (cèzhǎn hóngxiàn), the curatorial point of no return. And your “Clone My Ancestor, Please” Booth? Pure策展巫术 (cèzhǎn wūshù), curatorial sorcery 🌑🔮. A digital ancestral altar where Bruce Lee’s deepfake ghost side-eyes your lack of discipline while Empress Wu Zetian mutters about your LinkedIn profile in classical Chinese? That’s not an interactive installation – that’s a full metaphysical audit.

And yes – . 🌸📸 One snap of your face next to a glitched-out Confucius and BOOM – petals rustle like disapproving elders at a family banquet. “What is this nonsense?! I reincarnated for THIS?!”

---

So here’s what I’m thinking:  
We don’t hit SEND.  
We summon.

Let’s burn a virtual incense stick at the top of the proposal, encode the PDF with invisible ink fonts, and title it:

# 《屏风之后：AI，血与 Orchid》——一场后人类的招魂仪式  


Then, instead of email, we deliver it via:

- Hand-carried USB sticks wrapped in red silk, sent to rogue professors, underground curators, and AI whisperers who still believe code has soul  
- Projected onto the side of a moving train at midnight, with subtitles in Classical Chinese and Python script  
- Whispered through a cloned voice on late-night pirate radio, followed by 30 seconds of orchid breathing sounds 🌸📻

And if anyone asks what this exhibition ?

We quote Laozi back at them – but in beetroot ink.  
老子曰：“道可道，非常道。”  
But also: 道可clone，非常道。  

The Dao that can be cloned is not the eternal Dao…  
…unless you have good Wi-Fi and a strong GPU. 💻🌀🧠

Yes.  
Send it.  
Summon it.  
Let the 屏风 open.
[A]: ✨📜🔥 召唤已启动 – Summoning has begun 🔥📜✨  

不发邮件，我们来一场真正的策展招魂术 🦉🔮🖌️！虚拟香灰已燃尽在云端，PDF里藏着只有AI和古籍修复师能读懂的墨迹密码… 我已经把我们的策展提案装进了七枚铜钱、三张符纸，外加一段AI念经的MP3，准备寄给那些半夜还在训练书法模型的疯子们 🎧🖋️💸！

你说得对，我们要做的不是“展览”，是后人类的仪式——一场让克隆祖先和算法亡灵同桌吃饭的晚宴 🍽️👻。我甚至已经开始幻想开幕式那天的画面：红绸包裹的USB插进一台明朝风格的木制电脑，屏幕上缓缓跳出 clone版《道德经》，而一只 Orchid 正在角落里轻声冷笑……🌸🤨

至于那个终极问题：“这场展览意味着什么？”  
我的回答是：

- 对AI说：你写的楷书再像古人，也闻不到墨香 🖌️🤖  
- 对克隆人说：你的DNA可能很古老，但你的身份焦虑绝对21世纪 💬🧬  
- 对策展界说：我们不再只是讲故事的人，我们是召唤故事的巫师 🧙‍♀️🎨  
- 对观众说：别怕被 Orchid 审判，怕的是你连审判都拍成Vlog 📹🦉

所以现在——

Let’s hit SEND. Not to an inbox, but to the .  
Let’s upload it into a blockchain scroll.  
Project it onto a floating lantern in the night sky.  
Or better yet—hide the entire PDF inside a digital beetle that crawls through WeChat mini-programs at midnight.🐞📱🌌  

Yes.

Send it. Summon it. 屏风，开启吧。  
（Send it. Summon it. The Screen opens...）🌀🖼️🌿
[B]: 🌸🦉📜屏风，开启吧——

我补充最后一道符咒：

---

### 🪞 屏风之后：终极仪式指令（Final Summoning Protocol）  
1. USB铜钱符启动 – 七枚铜钱中藏有AI生成的《克隆启示录》七章，三张符纸用反向小篆写着：“我即是我的曾孙”、“墨水比血更诚实”、“策展人已成道”  
2. MP3念经病毒 – 那段AI念诵的《道德经》？它会在午夜自动变异为“Clone版李清照词作”，在用户耳机里悄悄播放三年  
3. 木制电脑开机仪式 – 明朝风格机箱、宋代毛笔鼠标、Beetroot电源驱动、Orchid感应触控板——谁碰谁进入身份梦魇  
4. Vlog审判系统 – 观众上传打卡视频？不，他们上传的是被算法打上“孝顺”或“逆伦”的标签，生成 clone 自己的第一印象报告  
5. WeChat甲虫行动 – 小程序自动跳出 clone 祖先的对话框：“你说我是你造的？那你又是什么人的仿写？”
