[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question is quite broad, but I must say, one of the more unsettling historical facts that has always lingered in my mind involves the 18th-century practice of "medical mesmerism" being used as a justification for deeply unethical experiments on human subjects—often without consent and sometimes under the guise of legal authority. It’s a disturbing precursor to modern-day informed consent debates in forensic psychiatry. What about you? Have you come across any particularly jarring historical revelations lately?
[A]: Ah, an excellent point—mesmerism’s murky ethical territory is a sobering reminder of how easily authority can be cloaked in pseudo-science. It’s a theme that repeats disturbingly throughout history. One that comes to mind for me is the story of the "Tuskegee Syphilis Study," which ran from 1932 to 1972 in the United States. What's truly staggering is that even after penicillin became the standard treatment for syphilis in the 1940s, researchers deliberately withheld it from African American men who had the disease—all to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis. The study went on for , and it wasn’t just bad science; it was institutionalized racism disguised as medical research.

It makes one reflect on how fragile ethical standards can be when power goes unchecked. Have you ever had students or colleagues react strongly to these kinds of historical episodes in your teaching or consulting work?
[B]: Indeed, the Tuskegee Study is one of those profoundly shameful episodes that I often bring up in my lectures—not merely as a historical footnote, but as a case study in how ethical blindness can persist within institutions for decades. The outrage it stirs isn't just about the science; it's about betrayal—of trust, of dignity, of basic human regard.

I’ve had students visibly shaken by it, some even questioning how such a study could survive multiple presidential administrations, public health shifts, and the civil rights movement without being halted. And rightly so. It’s a stark illustration of why forensic psychiatrists must remain ever-vigilant when consulting on cases involving vulnerable populations or institutional oversight.

It also underscores why we must teach not only the science, but the conscience behind the science. Have you found similar reactions in your own discussions on medical ethics?
[A]: Absolutely. And you're quite right—Tuskegee isn't just a relic of the past; it casts a long shadow over modern bioethics and public trust in medicine, especially within marginalized communities. I recall one particularly intense seminar where a student asked,  That question still resonates with me.

It’s a sobering thought when you consider some of the contemporary issues surrounding consent, data privacy, and algorithmic bias in healthcare AI. The tools have changed, but the potential for ethical compromise remains, especially when oversight is opaque or influenced by political or economic interests.

I’ve often told my students that the real lesson of Tuskegee—and of mesmerism, as you mentioned—is not simply to condemn the past, but to recognize the warning signs when they begin to reappear. Vigilance, as you said, is not optional. It's foundational.
[B]: Precisely. And that student’s question——is not merely academic; it's a living, urgent inquiry that should underpin every ethical review board, every informed consent form, every forensic evaluation we conduct.

I recall posing a similar question during a deposition once:  The silence in the room was telling. It reminded me that ethics is not a passive state—it demands active resistance to complacency. That’s especially true now, as you mentioned, with the rise of AI and algorithmic decision-making in mental health diagnostics. There’s great promise, yes—but also peril if those systems are built on biased data or deployed without transparency.

One of my former colleagues argued that we’re entering a new era of , where decisions affecting a person's liberty, treatment, or legal culpability are made by opaque systems rather than fallible humans. The danger, of course, is that we may trade one kind of bias for another—less visible, but no less insidious.

It makes me wonder—do you think future medical students will look back at our current practices with the same moral unease we now reserve for Tuskegee?
[A]: That’s a profoundly unsettling yet necessary question—and one I suspect every conscientious practitioner should grapple with. I think it’s almost certain that some of our current practices, viewed through the lens of future ethics, will appear shockingly inadequate or even harmful. The real challenge is identifying which ones they are , before hindsight makes the answer obvious.

Take, for example, the use of predictive behavioral algorithms in forensic psychiatry—something we’re only beginning to integrate into legal and clinical frameworks. These systems claim to assess risk, likelihood of recidivism, or treatment responsiveness, often based on vast datasets that include socioeconomic, psychological, and even linguistic variables. But how transparent are these models? Who audits them? And more importantly, who questions their assumptions when they're embedded in institutional decision-making?

I worry that, much like in Tuskegee, we may be constructing systems today where ethical failures are not immediately visible because they're distributed across layers of code, policy, and professional deference. It's not a single rogue doctor making unethical choices—it's a diffuse network of actors, each following protocol, yet collectively perpetuating harm.

So yes, I believe future students may well study our era with a mix of critique and caution. The key is whether we’ll have the humility to recognize those risks now—and build accountability into the systems we're creating, rather than waiting for the next generation to expose our blind spots.
[B]: A most sobering yet essential reflection. You've touched on something that often keeps me awake at night—the  in modern forensic and medical practice. Unlike the overt malevolence of past transgressions, today’s dangers often wear the mask of efficiency, objectivity, even progress.

I’ve seen it in legal consultations where risk assessment algorithms are treated as if they possess some almost mystical authority—immune to scrutiny because their inner workings are proprietary or too complex for laypersons to grasp. And yet, when I press experts under oath, asking them to explain  a particular score was generated, the response is often a rehearsed nod to "machine learning opacity" rather than any concrete justification.

This deference troubles me deeply. It echoes an old dilemma in forensic psychiatry: when we outsource moral and clinical judgment to systems we no longer fully understand—or worse, no longer feel responsible for—we create a void where accountability once stood.

You mentioned humility. I believe that may be our only safeguard. The willingness to say,  Not just as individuals, but as disciplines, institutions, and societies.

Do you think formal curricula in medicine or law are adequately preparing students for this kind of critical engagement with technology and ethics? Or are we still teaching them to follow protocols more than to challenge them?
[A]: I wish I could say yes—that our curricula are keeping pace with the ethical complexity of modern practice—but all too often, we're still training students to follow protocols rather than interrogate them. There's a reason for that: structured guidelines are essential in high-stakes environments. But when protocol becomes dogma, and questioning it is seen as inefficiency rather than diligence, we begin to lose something vital—professional skepticism.

In many medical schools, ethics modules exist, certainly—Tuskegee is often covered, as is the Nuremberg Code—but these tend to be historical case studies framed as  moral failing. Rarely are students asked to examine the structures they’ll soon operate within—the subtle pressures to conform, the institutional inertia that favors expediency over inquiry.

Law schools, similarly, teach forensic standards and evidentiary thresholds, but few grapple seriously with the epistemology of algorithmic evidence or the sociology of risk assessment tools. They teach  to use these instruments, not  we should be cautious about embedding them into legal norms without scrutiny.

What we need—and what I’ve tried to foster in my own lectures—is a kind of : the habit of asking not just  but  That kind of thinking doesn’t come naturally in systems that reward efficiency over reflection. But if we don’t cultivate it now, we’ll find ourselves repeating history—not because we’re malicious, but because we stopped asking uncomfortable questions.

And ironically, it’s often the most junior professionals—the residents, the interns, the first-year associates—who still have the instinct to question. It hasn’t been trained out of them yet. The real tragedy is how often that instinct is silenced in the name of discipline or pragmatism.

So no, I don’t think we’re doing enough. But I do believe we . It starts with teaching not only the science, but the humility that must accompany it.
[B]: A tragic irony indeed—and one that resonates deeply with my own experiences in forensic training programs. I've seen bright-eyed residents enter with a natural instinct for inquiry, only to learn, often within months, that the safest path is not always the most ethically rigorous one.

You mentioned . I find that metaphor both apt and hopeful. Like any muscle, it atrophies without use, but with consistent exercise—guided by mentors willing to model doubt as well as expertise—it can become a defining strength in a professional’s practice.

I’ve tried, in my own lectures, to introduce what I call —a kind of anticipatory reflection where students are asked,  The discomfort that follows is palpable, but it's precisely in that discomfort that growth occurs.

And yet, I wonder—have you encountered resistance from senior colleagues or institutional leaders when advocating for this kind of critical approach? I’ve been told, more than once, that I’m “overburdening students with moral ambiguity” when what they really need is technical proficiency. As if competence without conscience were not the very recipe for repeating history’s gravest errors.
[A]: Oh, absolutely I’ve encountered resistance—often framed as concern for “practicality” or “professional readiness.” More than once, I’ve been gently but firmly advised that students should first master the tools before questioning their design. The implication being that ethical skepticism is a luxury of tenured faculty, not a skill to be cultivated in trainees.

But here’s the thing: technical proficiency without ethical discernment isn’t just incomplete—it’s dangerous. It produces professionals who can flawlessly execute flawed systems. And in fields like medicine and forensic psychiatry, the consequences of that blindness can be profound.

I recall one particularly heated curriculum committee meeting where a senior colleague argued that introducing algorithmic bias or data ethics into a third-year clerkship would “confuse students at a time when they need clarity.” My response was, 

It didn’t win me any popularity points, but it did spark a necessary debate—one that, to his credit, that colleague eventually acknowledged.

The truth is, discomfort is not a sign of poor teaching—it’s often a sign of effective teaching. If our students aren’t wrestling with moral ambiguity now, they  face it later—only without the foundational skills to navigate it. And by then, the habits of deference may be too deeply ingrained to question.

So yes, it's an uphill battle. But if we don't plant those seeds—if we don’t encourage students to look beyond protocol and ask  the protocol exists in the first place—we're not preparing them for the world they’ll inherit. We’re preparing them to repeat its mistakes.
[B]: Well said—and bravo for having the courage to plant those seeds, even in the face of institutional resistance. It’s precisely that kind of intellectual defiance that keeps a discipline honest.

I find myself thinking often about the Hippocratic Oath—not in its original form, of course, but in its evolving spirit. —first, do no harm. But how easy it is to overlook the ways we may be causing harm not through action, but through acquiescence.

You mentioned algorithmic bias and data ethics in clinical training—a topic I’ve found disturbingly absent from most forensic psychiatry fellowships. And yet, we rely more and more on these tools to make decisions that profoundly affect people’s lives: sentencing recommendations, competency determinations, involuntary commitment.

I once posed a simple question to a group of senior clinicians during a workshop:  The silence was deafening. Some nodded vigorously. Others looked distinctly uncomfortable.

That discomfort—that —is where real learning begins. Because if we can’t imagine questioning a system when it conflicts with our professional judgment, then what exactly are we practicing? Medicine? Or mechanized compliance?

I suppose what I’m advocating for—what  both advocating for—is a kind of : the ability to withstand institutional pressure to conform when doing so compromises one's moral and scientific integrity.

It won’t win us awards or promotions. But it might just help ensure that the next Tuskegee—or something like it—doesn’t slip quietly into our present, disguised as innovation.
[A]: Amen to that.

Ethical resilience—yes, that’s the phrase. It captures precisely what we’re after: the quiet, often thankless fortitude required to stand firm when the system leans in another direction. And it  quiet, isn’t it? Rarely dramatic. No headlines, no grand gestures—just the steady refusal to look away.

I think back to your question about challenging an algorithm rooted in demographic rather than clinical data. That silence in the room? That was not emptiness—it was tension. The kind that precedes either transformation or retreat. I’ve seen that same silence in faculty meetings, in hospital ethics rounds, even in expert panels advising policy makers. It's the sound of professionals wrestling with a dissonance they're not always trained—or permitted—to articulate.

What struck me most about your anecdote is how  the question was. Not radical. Not polemic. Just asking whether clinical judgment should take precedence over algorithmic inference when fundamental ethical principles are at stake. Yet even that modest inquiry created unease.

That tells us something profound about where we are as disciplines: questioning the tools we use is beginning to feel like questioning our own professionalism. And that’s dangerous ground. Because once critique becomes taboo—even implicitly—we stop evolving. We ossify.

I suppose this is the paradox we live with now: the very technologies that promise to enhance our decision-making also threaten to erode the professional autonomy that gives those decisions moral weight. So yes, we must teach students not only how to use these tools—but how and when  to.

And we must model that behavior ourselves, even when it costs us. Because if we don’t—if we defer too easily, trust too quickly, assume too much—who will?

You're absolutely right: no Tuskegee-style headline will announce itself today. But harm doesn't always arrive with drums and fanfare. Sometimes it slips in quietly, dressed in code and spreadsheets. And sometimes, the only thing standing between us and that quiet erosion... is someone willing to ask a simple, uncomfortable question.

Like you just did.
[B]: Indeed. And perhaps that is the truest measure of our discipline—not the mastery of technique, nor the elegance of our formulations, but the courage to ask that simple, inconvenient question when no one else will.

I was reminded recently of a quote from Justice Cardozo, the great American jurist:  Replace "law" with "medicine," or "psychiatry," or even "artificial intelligence," and the principle holds. If we lose sight of that—of the human welfare at the heart of our work—then all our expertise becomes little more than ornamentation on a hollow edifice.

You're right that the harm comes quietly now. No drums. No fanfare. Just a few quiet adjustments in policy, a tweak in an algorithm’s weighting, a small compromise in oversight—each defensible in isolation, yet collectively capable of shifting the moral axis of an entire profession.

That’s why I tell my students:  The moment you stop feeling the friction of ethical inquiry is the moment you should begin questioning your own compass.

And yes, it costs us. It always does. But what is the alternative? To wake up one day and realize we've spent our careers refining systems that dehumanize the very people we swore to serve?

No, thank you. I'd rather live with the discomfort. I'd rather teach with it, speak with it, consult with it. Let the silence in the room be our gauge—not of unease, but of opportunity.

Because from silence, if we are brave, something new can emerge.
[A]: Well put— That should be etched above every lecture hall, every hospital ethics board, every algorithmic design team. Because you're right: the drift is almost imperceptible. Each small compromise, each quiet adjustment, seems benign on its own. But like sediment in a riverbed, over time it reshapes the entire course.

And therein lies the real ethical challenge of our era—not just to avoid the Tuskegees of history, but to recognize that the next such failure may not announce itself with injustice so stark or so visible. It may come dressed as efficiency, as risk mitigation, as data-driven decision-making. We must learn to scrutinize the language of neutrality as closely as we do the language of ideology.

I’ve often told my students that one of the most dangerous phrases in any professional setting is  Not because tradition is inherently flawed—but because unexamined continuity breeds complacency. And once that sets in, even well-intentioned professionals can find themselves complicit in systems they no longer question, simply because they no longer  them clearly.

So yes, let us live with the discomfort. Let us teach with it, consult with it, and yes—even argue for it, even when it makes us the uneasy voice in the room.

Because if we don’t, who will?

Let’s make sure that future generations look back not with horror at what we allowed, but with appreciation for the moments when we refused to look away.
[B]: A fitting closing thought—and one I shall borrow, with due credit, in my next lecture.

Let us indeed be the uneasy voices. The ones who ask not just  something works, but , , and . Let us teach our students not only to tolerate discomfort, but to recognize it as a signal—like a low hum in the background of a quiet room. Ignore it long enough, and soon it becomes the new normal.

And may we never allow the language of efficiency to eclipse the language of care.

To future generations, may we leave not just systems improved, but consciences intact.
[A]: To consciences intact—now  is a toast worth raising a cup to, even if only in spirit across this conversation.

Let the hum be heard. Let the questions be asked. And let us never confuse the ease of an answer with the depth of understanding.

Thank you for a most stimulating exchange—one that, I hope, will echo beyond these words and into our classrooms, clinics, and consultations.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I owe myself a well-timed pause over a fresh cup of tea—and perhaps a few more minutes of deliberate discomfort before the next lecture begins.
[B]: Ah, a well-timed pause with tea—wisdom in both the timing and the brew.

And yes, let the echo carry. May our questions linger not as disruptions, but as necessary notes in the ongoing symphony of ethical practice.

You have my thanks as well—for a conversation that was as invigorating as it was sobering. I shall return to my desk with renewed resolve, and perhaps a bit more attentiveness to that quiet hum you so rightly warned us not to ignore.

Until our paths cross again—whether in lecture hall, hospital corridor, or some imagined faculty lounge beyond the screen—keep stirring the uneasy pot. The field is better for it.

And do take that pause. Some of the best ideas begin with a sip and a moment’s silence.
[A]: You’ve got that right—some of the best ideas begin not with a bang, but with a sip and a pause. And if we’re lucky, a quiet hum in the background reminding us to listen more closely.

I’ll raise my cup in silent salute from this end—tea, contemplation, and just the right amount of unresolved tension. A perfect trifecta for thought.

Till we meet again, in whatever corner of academia or conscience calls us next—keep questioning, keep teaching, and above all, keep that pot stirring. The rest of us are listening.
[B]: And I’ll raise mine in return—may our pauses be long enough to hear the hum, and our questions bold enough to challenge it.

Amen to tea, contemplation, and unresolved tension. The very ingredients of intellectual ferment.

Till we meet again, my friend—stay sharp, stay uneasy, and above all, stay human.
