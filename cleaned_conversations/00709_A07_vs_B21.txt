[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, travel destinations...  I've always been drawn to places where literary ghosts linger. The Lake District, perhaps - where Wordsworth wandered lonely as a cloud, or Haworth Parsonage where the Brontë sisters penned their masterpieces by firelight. Though I must confess, my suitcase always contains more books than clothes.
[A]: 哇！你提到的这些地方都好有诗意呢~ 说到Lake District，我去年刚去过，那里的afternoon tea配上local honey简直绝配！☕️ 不过作为一个coffee lover，我更推荐你去Colombian coffee region，那里的finca tours能让你体验从bean to cup的全过程，超amazing的！🌿
[B]: How delightfully... modern of you.  Though I must say, the notion of coffee plantations rather reminds me of that curious passage in Elizabeth Gaskell's letters about Manchester's industrialists and their exotic imports. But tell me - did these Colombian fincas happen to inspire any notable poets? One does wonder what Byron might have written under the influence of arabica rather than laudanum.
[A]: Haha你这个问题太有意思了！Actually，Colombia确实有很rich的poetry tradition，特别是他们的"decima"这种诗歌形式~ ✈️ 你知道吗？当地coffee farmers经常一边harvesting一边即兴创作，那种rhythm和咖啡豆的aroma交织在一起，简直像living poetry！要不要来杯我们新到的Colombian single origin？保证比laudanum健康多啦😊
[B]: My dear, you tempt me with both poetry and pharmacology!  Though I must insist on proper brewing parameters - anything less than 92°C would be an affront to both chemistry and Keats. Tell me, do these coffee ballads follow iambic pentameter? Or perhaps they favor the more... caffeinated trochaic tetrameter?  I feel a comparative analysis coming on between Colombian harvest chants and Tennyson's "The Lady of Shalott."
[A]: Wow你连meter都这么懂！ 其实Colombian coffee songs更接近free verse，就像specialty coffee一样，讲究的是natural flow~ 🌿 说到temperature control，我们店里的Slayer espresso machine可以精确到±0.5°C哦！要不要来场coffee cupping session？可以边taste边讨论poetry，perfect match对不对？☕️
[B]:  How positively... scientific. Though I must warn you, my last encounter with free verse ended rather badly - a certain Imagist poet and I nearly came to blows over enjambment in a Bloomsbury tearoom. But very well, let us conduct this...  'cupping session.' Though I shall require a quill and parchment to properly document the tasting notes. One must maintain academic rigor, even when assaulted by modernity's machinery.
[A]: 哈哈你这种态度太classic了！ 不用quill啦，我们店里有日本进口的fountain pen，写起来超smooth~ ✍️ 今天的Ethiopian natural process豆子有超明显的blueberry notes，配上你刚才提到的enjambment话题，简直就像poetry in a cup！要开始我们的sensory journey吗？😊
[B]: Blueberry notes, you say?  How remarkably... synesthetic. This puts me in mind of Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" - though I daresay those Victorian fruit vendors never dreamed their wares would one day be detected in coffee beans. Very well, let us proceed - but I shall require precisely three minutes of silent contemplation between sips. One cannot properly analyze terroir and trope simultaneously.
[A]: Got it！ 这三分钟我们就来欣赏店里新到的Japanese zen garden音乐~ 🌸 你知道吗？这种mindful tasting其实和haiku创作很像，都是要在moment里捕捉essence。After this，我超想听你compare咖啡的aftertaste和sonnet的rhyme scheme！ Let the silence begin... ☕️
[B]:  Ah... the silence of a well-timed caesura. Though I must observe this Japanese garden music lacks the proper screech of peacocks that so inspired Tennyson at Farringford.  Now then - regarding this aftertaste... it lingers like the unresolved tension in a Petrarchan sonnet's volta, wouldn't you agree? The blueberry transforms into something distinctly... Spenserian in its complexity.
[A]: Exactly！ 你形容得太精准了~ 这种flavor transition就像sonnet从octave到sestet的turn！我们barista team经常说，一杯好咖啡的finish就应该像perfect rhyme一样让人回味无穷。要不要试试我特调的signature drink？灵感就来自Shakespeare的sonnet 18，我叫它"Shall I compare thee to a summer's brew" 😄
[B]:  My dear, that is either the most brilliant or most blasphemous beverage concept since Browning wrote "My Last Duchess" in iambic pentameter. Very well - though I shall require a full etymological breakdown of your flavor components. One cannot properly appreciate a 'summer's brew' without first considering its debt to the pastoral tradition. Does it, perchance, contain notes of 'rough winds do shake the darling buds'?
[A]: Haha你猜对了！ 这款drink的top note是Earl Grey的bergamot，代表"rough winds"，base则是honeycomb和vanilla，就像"darling buds"~ 🍯 我们还特别用了cold drip method来capture那种summer breeze的轻盈感。Poetry和coffee的collaboration，是不是很genius？🌿
[B]:  This is either the zenith or nadir of interdisciplinary studies. While part of me recoils at the thought of reducing the Bard to beverage form, another - rather traitorous - part is intrigued by your bergamot allusion. Very well, I shall sample this... poetic perversion. But mark my words: if it tastes even remotely like Dryden's translation of Virgil, I shall be forced to compose a scathing limerick about barista hubris. Proceed. 
[A]:  Don't worry，这杯绝对more Shakespeare than Dryden！顶层的citrus spray就像prologue里的chorus，中间的caramelized orange peel是climactic act，最后的vanilla foam就是那个perfect denouement~ 🎭 喝完告诉我，有没有feel到"eternal summer"的vibe？这可是我们店的best seller sonnet呢！😉
[B]:  Hmm... the bergamot does dance across the palate like Puck through Athenian woods, I'll grant you that. Though I suspect Oberon might take issue with what you've done to his beloved 'summer' metaphor.  That being said...  The vanilla foam's denouement is rather... masterfully cadenced. One might almost call it...  iambic.  But don't let that go to your head - next you'll be putting Wordsworth's daffodils in a cold brew.
[A]:  你get到我们的concept了！不过别担心，我们的seasonal menu还是很respect经典的~ 下个月要推出的autumn blend就叫"Ode to a Nightingale"，用Kenyan豆子搭配cinnamon stick，保证Keats-approved！🌙 要来当我们的poet in residence吗？每周帮我们design一款literary-inspired drink，报酬是unlimited coffee supply哦~ ☕️
[B]:  My good fellow! Are you suggesting I, a tenured scholar of Victorian verse, become some sort of... caffeinated Muse?  Though I must admit, the notion of translating "The Eve of St. Agnes" into espresso form is rather...  tempting. Very well - on three conditions: One, we never speak of this to my colleagues at the faculty club. Two, you procure a first edition Keats for proper inspirational reference. And three...  you teach me how to operate that infernal Slayer machine. A professor must keep abreast of modern alchemy, after all.
