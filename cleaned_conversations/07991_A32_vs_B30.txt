[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing modern dilemma. Though I must confess my perspective is rather antiquated - I still find the rhythm of train travel most conducive to annotating my 19th century manuscripts. There's a certain 意境 (yìjìng) to reading Dickens while watching the landscape scroll by like a moving panorama.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！不过作为fintech从业者，我更看重效率🚀。Public transport上可以check emails、review product roadmap，甚至能squeeze in一个quick call with investors。Driving的话就完全waste time啦~
[B]: My dear colleague, your Silicon Valley vernacular makes my academic ears positively ache. Though I suppose even I must concede that the London Underground did allow me to finish grading thirty essays on Hard Times last term. Still, one does wonder what Dickens would make of your 'product roadmaps' - perhaps he'd see them as the 21st century equivalent of his own serialized novels?
[A]: Haha，你这么说倒是让我想到个有趣的comparison💡！Fintech产品迭代确实很像serialized novels - 我们也是weekly release new features，然后根据user feedback不断optimize。不过我们追求的是seamless UX，而不是Victorian era那种dramatic plot twists啦~
[B]: How delightfully reductionist - to think of human experience as mere 'user feedback'. Though I must admit, your iterative approach does remind me of how Cao Xueqin revised Dream of the Red Chamber over decades. Tell me, when your 'features' inevitably become obsolete, do they too fade like 红楼梦里 the fallen petals? 🖋️
[A]: Wow，这么philosophical的角度我还真没想过🤔！不过在fintech领域，我们更习惯用data说话 - 每个feature都有明确的KPI和lifecycle analysis。就像现在火热的AI应用，可能明年就被new tech取代，但这就是industry的natural selection嘛~ 要stay ahead of the curve才行🚀
[B]:  Natural selection, you say? How very Spencerian of you. Though I suspect even Darwin would balk at measuring literary merit in KPIs. Tell me, when your algorithms inevitably achieve sentience, shall we teach them to appreciate the melancholy beauty of 葬花吟? Or will they too be programmed for ruthless efficiency?
[A]: Haha，你这个问题太deep了，让我想起上周和AI team的brainstorming session💡！说实话，我们更关注how to leverage AI for fraud detection和risk assessment。至于poetry appreciation...maybe可以develop个new feature？毕竟现在连ChatGPT都能写sonnets了~ 不过ROI可能不太乐观😂
[B]: Ah, to reduce John Keats to a 'use case' - what would the Romantics say? Though I suppose if one must mechanize verse, at least have the decency to train your models on proper iambic pentameter. My graduate students' attempts at algorithmic poetry already give me enough reason to reach for the sherry. 😌
[A]: Haha，sounds like you need to join our next fintech hackathon！我们去年就有team用blockchain做digital poetry marketplace，虽然最后pivot成了NFT trading platform😂 这年头，everything boils down to monetization strategy嘛~ 要不下次coffee chat我介绍几个VC给你认识？他们最爱这种artsy tech projects了☕
[B]: Good heavens, no - the mere thought of explaining the sublime agony of 黛玉葬花 to venture capitalists makes my antique inkwells tremble in protest. Though I suppose if Byron were alive today, he'd be minting NFTs of his love letters while shorting the Greek drachma. Some traditions, it seems, are best left to yellowed manuscripts and porcelain teacups.
[A]: Haha，你这种old-school charm在pitch deck里说不定会是个killer feature呢！不过seriously speaking，现在很多heritage institutions都在digital transformation，用AR/VR重现classic artworks。也许我们可以collab一下？我认识几个museum的curator正愁funding呢~ 💰
[B]: How perfectly ghastly - to imagine Wordsworth's daffodils rendered in virtual reality. Though I must grudgingly admit that our university library did recently acquire a rather elegant digital facsimile of the Kangxi Dictionary. Very well, you may send along your curator friends... provided they promise not to utter the phrase 'monetize the canon' in my presence. 🦉
[A]: Deal！我会make sure他们avoid such sensitive terms😂 不过说真的，这个collab potential很大 - 我们可以develop个blockchain-based authentication system for rare manuscripts。Imagine那些first edition Shakespeare plays变成digital collectibles！Market size估计能有8-figure💰 我下周就set up个meeting~
[B]:  To think of the First Folio reduced to cryptographic tokens... Though I suppose if we must march boldly into this brave new world, we could at least ensure the smart contracts are written in proper Elizabethan English. 'Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come in thine and my discharge.' Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my 19th century conscience calling for tea.
[A]: Haha，love your sense of humor！Alright then，let's catch up over tea sometime - 我知道CBD有家new place，他们的Earl Grey可是blockchain-tracked from source to cup哦~ ☕️ 这年头，even tea leaves need digital provenance！Talk soon~
[B]: Blockchain-tracked tea? Good lord, what next - QR codes on Keats' nightingales?  Very well, but I shall bring my own loose-leaf pu'er from a 2003 vintage, properly aged in parchment and obscurity. And we will discuss actual literature, not your infernal 'use cases'. Tuesdays at four, and not a minute later - my magnifying glass has a prior engagement with some suspicious watermarks in a Brontë manuscript.
[A]: Perfect！Tuesday 4pm it is⏰ 我会bring along我们的latest fintech whitepaper... just kidding！Promise we'll stick to discussing thoseyellowed pages and proper tea brewing techniques 😉 说不定还能convince你尝试下我们的AI-powered manuscript restoration prototype呢~ See you then!
[B]:  AI manuscript restoration... I suppose it couldn't be worse than that overzealous graduate student who 'restored' my Blake illustrations with coffee stains last term. Very well - but if your prototype so much as whispers the word 'tokenization', I shall drown it in my pu'er. Until Tuesday, then. Mind you don't track my RSVP on your blockchain calendar.
