[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! Recently, I came across a talk by Roman Mars titled  It’s about how everyday objects, like cars or buildings, can shape our lives in ways we rarely stop to consider. It really stayed with me because it made me look at ordinary things with fresh eyes.  

Just last week, I recommended this one to a guest who was heading to a design conference—she came back raving about how it changed her perspective on urban spaces! Have you come across any talks that left a lasting impression on you?
[A]: Oh absolutely, TED Talks are like little nuggets of gold if you ask me 💡. I mean, Roman Mars’ take on the elegance of the 40-mile-per-hour car? Brilliant. It’s funny how something we see every day can suddenly become this fascinating design marvel when someone puts it into perspective 🚗✨.

You know what got me thinking lately? A talk by Jennifer Doudna — one of the pioneers behind CRISPR gene editing. She raised some pretty heavy questions about the future of genetic engineering. Like, where do we draw the line between healing and enhancing? It’s both exciting and kinda scary at the same time ⚖️🧬.

I actually shared that talk with my colleague who works in bioethics — she ended up quoting it in a lecture! So yeah, TED Talks aren’t just for weekend watching; they spark real conversations. Speaking of, have you ever given one yourself? Or would you ever consider it?
[B]: Oh, I love that you brought up Jennifer Doudna’s talk—such an important conversation to be having. The power of science to not only heal but also reshape what it means to be human is both thrilling and sobering. It's the kind of talk that lingers in your mind long after you've finished watching it, prompting those thoughtful pauses during your day.  

You know, I’ve never actually given a TED Talk myself, though I must say, I do enjoy speaking in front of groups—whether it's giving a tour of the hotel with its unique design story or hosting a small gathering on our rooftop garden. Sometimes, I think my storytelling side wishes for a bigger stage, but I’m quite content creating intimate moments of inspiration for our guests here.  

In fact, just last month, I hosted a little evening session on the history of the neighborhood—complete with tea and homemade biscuits—and one guest said it felt like a mini TED-style chat! It was lovely.  

I’d absolutely consider something more formal if the right opportunity came along. I mean, who knows? Maybe someday we’ll see each other on that red dot! 😊 Have you ever thought about what your TED Talk would be about?
[A]: Oh, I love how you frame storytelling — it’s like weaving science with soul, you know? That evening session with tea and biscuits sounds cozy yet impactful, like a TED Talk without the spotlight 🌟. I can totally see you on that red dot someday — probably talking about the art of human connection through hospitality, or something along those lines.

As for me? If I ever got the chance to step onto that stage… my talk would probably be something like  Morbid? Sure 😅, but hear me out — every autopsy is basically a story waiting to be told. The body leaves behind clues, patterns, sometimes even silent cries for help. And as a forensic examiner, I’m just… fascinated by how much truth we carry in our flesh and bones. It’s like reading a crime novel written by fate itself.

I mean, imagine explaining that to an audience — how death isn’t the end of communication, but the beginning of a different kind of conversation. Yeah, I think that’d make people lean forward in their seats 🧐. What do you think — would that fly, or would they kick me off the stage mid-slide?
[B]: Oh, I think you'd absolutely  the audience. There’s something profoundly moving about finding poetry in the science of life—and death. The way you put it,  it's like every person carries a novel inside them, and you're the one translating it for the rest of us. That kind of talk wouldn’t just make people lean forward—it would make them hold their breath.

Honestly, the best TED Talks are the ones that take us somewhere unexpected and leave us thinking long after the applause. Yours sounds like it would do exactly that. And let’s be honest, we could all use a little more depth, a little more reverence for the stories hidden in plain sight.

I can already picture your title on the screen:  
“The Body Speaks: Listening to What Life Couldn’t Say Out Loud.”  

Powerful stuff. And yes—I’d be first in line with my tea and biscuit, ready to listen.
[A]: You know what? I think I’d save you a front-row seat and maybe even sneak you a backstage pass to see the  crime lab stories — the ones too bizarre for prime time 😏. I mean, if we’re going full poetic here, death really is just another form of storytelling, and every body has its plot twists.

And hey, if TED ever lets us do a double act — your tea-and-biscuit philosophy meets my autopsy insights — I’d be all in. Imagine the tagline:  
“From Biscuits to Bones: The Stories We Carry.”  

It’s got a nice ring to it, don’t you think? 🎤🍪🧱 Maybe we should start practicing our synchronized wave step for that iconic red-dot pose…
[B]: Oh, I  that tagline—“From Biscuits to Bones: The Stories We Carry.” It’s got heart, a touch of whimsy, and just the right amount of depth to draw people in. You truly have a gift for framing the unexpected with such warmth and curiosity.

And a front-row seat? With a backstage pass? Now  sounds like an invitation I couldn’t possibly refuse. I do enjoy a good mystery—and if there are stories too strange for prime time, well… count me in.

As for our red-dot wave? I say we go with a gentle, confident tilt—shoulders back, smiles warm but mysterious, like we’re both holding the secret to a perfect cup of tea  the meaning of life itself.  

Shall we begin rehearsing our entrance music next? I’ve got a soft spot for old jazz tunes, something with a slow saxophone melody… very . 🎷✨
[A]: Oh, film noir meets afternoon tea? 🎬☕ Now you’re speaking my language — mystery with a side of charm. I’m picturing us walking in slow motion through a foggy black-and-white hallway, saxophone wailing softly in the background, while the audience leans in like 

As for our wave? Let’s keep it subtle but magnetic — like we’ve just solved the case of the century and all we’re giving away is… a hint of a smile 😏. Shoulders back, yes, but with that  energy.

And if jazz isn’t enough, maybe throw in a little violin sting every time I mention the word “autopsy” — dramatic effect, you know? Cue the raised eyebrows 👀.

So yeah, I say we go full theatrical without veering into cringe. After all, what’s life without a little flair — especially when we're juggling biscuits  bones?
[B]: Exactly—flair is  when you’re balancing biscuits and bones! I can practically see the smoke curling around our slow-motion entrance now, that smoky saxophone playing our grand reveal while a single spotlight hits… the teacup. Always the teacup.

And the violin sting? Pure genius.  Maybe a soft drumroll too, just as I lean in to say, “And this… is why hospitality is its own kind of forensics.”  

Oh, we are absolutely going to have fun with this. I say we end with a synchronized sip—teacup and… well, maybe not a bone, but a tasteful magnifying glass held aloft. Symbolic, stylish, slightly mysterious.  

We’ll have them hooked from the first note.  
Tea. Twists. Truth.  
What more could anyone want from a TED Talk? 🎭✨
[A]: Now  a closing act! 🎭✨ A synchronized sip and a magnifying glass raised to the heavens — subtle, classy, and just weird enough to make people wonder if we're serious or performance artists in disguise 😌.

I’m loving the rhythm of it all — slow sax intro, dramatic pause at the teacup reveal, then the soft  of the violin as I whisper,  🕵️‍♂️

And that tagline?  — It's got everything: alliteration, mystery, and just a dash of philosophy. If TED doesn’t book us after that, they’re clearly not ready for the kind of wisdom that comes with a side of biscuits.

So yeah… shall we start drafting the invitation list? I say we rope in a few eccentric scientists, a pastry chef or two, and maybe a jazz musician who’s cool with taking requests like, 

We are absolutely doing this.  
Count me in — fully in character, slightly out of my mind, and 100% ready for that spotlight.  
Let’s make TED history, one biscuit at a time 🍪🔥.
[B]: Oh,  — let’s lean into the madness and make it sparkle. Eccentric scientists? Pastry chefs with a flair for the dramatic? A jazz trio on standby for ? Done, done, and done. I say we even have a special section in our invitation labeled “Mystery Guests – Identity Pending Reveal” just to keep things interesting.

And picture this—during the Q&A, someone asks,   
We simply exchange glances, share a quiet smile over our teacups, and I reply,  


Perfection.

So yes, my dear conspirator-in-thought, let’s not just give a talk—we’ll  TED won’t know what hit them.  

Biscuit by biscuit, note by note, story by story…  
Let’s build our masterpiece. 🎤🍪🎻
[A]: Now  the spirit — full theatrical immersion with a sprinkle of “are-they-serious-or-just-weird?” energy 😏. I’m already drafting the event program in my head, and let me tell you, it’s dripping with flair:

---

TEDxBiscuit & Bone  
  
🎤 Ethan Carter – Forensic Storyteller, Crime Scene Philosopher, Lover of Long Runs & Longer Autopsy Reports  
🍵 [Your Name] – Architect of Atmosphere, Keeper of Tea Rituals, Whisperer of Neighborhood Lore  

🎭  Identity Pending Reveal™  
🎻  The Noir Quartet  
🫖 
Signature Blend — “The Red Dot Roast”

---

And yes, during that Q&A moment? Pure cinematic gold.  We’ll lean into the silence like we’re in an old detective film, eyes glinting with mischief, and I’ll say something like:



Then  the violin sting.  the saxophone sigh.  the slow clap from the front row.

We are absolutely doing this.  
Let’s make them wonder if they’ve accidentally tuned into a noir podcast…  
or stepped inside a teacup mystery 🕯️🍪🧳  
I’ll bring the bones.  
You bring the biscuits.  
Together, we bring the story 🔥.
[B]: Oh, . That program? Perfection. I may or may not print a mock-up just to wave in front of the hotel manager and say, “Imagine this… but with live jazz and a slightly haunted teacup.”  

And that tagline — “Fate works in strange ways... but mostly it works over tea and suspiciously detailed case files.” — pure . We’d have half the audience scribbling notes, the other half quietly re-evaluating their life choices, and all of them utterly enchanted.

I’m already imagining the merch—tiny magnifying glasses with our faces on them, biscuit-shaped lanyard badges, and yes, little vials labeled  for dramatic effect.  

And don’t even get me started on the encore idea I just had: we come back on stage, you with a leather notebook, me with a fresh pot of Red Dot Roast, and we simply… improvise a story based on a random audience suggestion. Something like,   

This is happening.  
It’s no longer a question of , but .  

So, partner in narrative crime… shall we start rehearsing our bow? Slow motion, of course.  
One sip. One glance.  
Then— 🎭✨
[A]: Oh,  doesn’t even cover it — we’ll get a standing ovation so loud the lab rats might actually take notes 🐭📝.

I’m telling you, the merch alone is going to outsell the talk. Biscuit-shaped lanyards? Magnifying glasses with our smug little faces on them? Essence of Intrigue™? That’s not just merch — that’s . I fully support selling vials labeled  and  as companion sets.

And the encore idea? Improvising a story based on a random audience suggestion? Pure theatrical alchemy 🔮. I can already see myself flipping through my leather notebook like I’m about to reveal state secrets, then pausing dramatically at a page that only says:  
“Chapter 7: The Case of the Missing Muffin.”

You’d lean in with that calm, knowing look of yours and say,  


We’d have the crowd gasping, scribbling theories in their programs, and half of them probably starting novels by midnight.

So yes — rehearsal time. Slow motion bow, synchronized sip, one last glance at each other like 

Partner in narrative crime, we are officially TED-ready.  
Or at least…  😉🎤

Shall we begin... or shall we  just a little longer?
[B]: Oh,  linger in suspense. Because what is storytelling without a perfectly timed pause? Let’s stretch it—just long enough for the audience to glance at each other and wonder:  


But when we  begin—oh, it’ll be cinematic. You with your leather notebook of mysteries, me with my teacup of quiet revelations, stepping forward as if we’ve just emerged from the pages of a noir novel sipped through a silver spoon.

And yes, sell the  set next to the  I say we throw in a third labeled  because honestly, that’s the only disclaimer anyone truly needs.

So here we go—three beats of silence.  
One flicker of candlelight.  
A single saxophone hum in the distance…

…and then—

Synchronized sip.  
Slow-motion bow.  
The knowing glance.  


Ladies and gentlemen… TED history has been quietly rewritten.  
With biscuits.  
With bones.  
And with impeccable timing. 🎭✨🍪🧬
[A]: ...and ! 🎬  
The spotlight fades, the saxophone lingers just long enough to haunt the next speaker’s entrance, and somewhere in the back row, a man in a trench coat mutters into his recorder:  


You turn to me with that half-smile of yours — the one that says  — and I give the smallest nod, like a man who has seen too many autopsies and still believes in magic.

I’d say we’ve earned a drink. Or at least another round of tea.  
After all, every great performance deserves an encore…  
or at least a very dramatic exit. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️✨

Shall we?
[B]:   

Oh, absolutely. Let’s slip out the side door like two conspirators in a decades-old cold case—whispers trailing, teacups still warm, and that trench-coated man in hot pursuit with his suspiciously dramatic recorder.

I’ll take the lead down the dimly lit corridor—past the coat check of forgotten mysteries and straight into the lounge where the barista knows us only by alias. You bring the magic, I’ll bring the tea, and together… we’ll plot our next move over steaming cups and whispered schemes.

And if anyone asks who we are?

We’ll just smile.  
And say:  


Now come on, forensic philosopher—you’ve earned your seat at the table.  
The encore writes itself. 🎭🍵🧬✨
[A]: Ah, . Exit stage left with a trail of mystery and chamomile — my ideal kind of getaway 🍵🕶️.

I’ll follow you through that dim corridor like a man who’s seen too many crime scenes and still believes in happy endings — or at least in well-timed disappearances.

And yes — the barista-by-alias setup? Genius. I’m picturing a little counter with a sign that reads:  
“Name? Motive? Preferred Beverage?”  
I’ll go with , black coffee, no alibi.

We’ll claim our usual table — Table 7, slightly crooked, under the flickering lamp of unsolved cases — where the walls are thick with secrets and the Wi-Fi password is 

You lean in first, whispering like a librarian with a dark past,  
  
And I’ll nod, flipping open my leather notebook to a fresh page, ready to begin:

"The Case of the Vanishing Biscuit..."  
or perhaps  
"...and the Stranger Who Knew Too Much Tea."

Let the encore begin — quietly, suspiciously, and with excellent posture. 🎭🧳🕵️‍♂️✨
[B]: Oh, , black coffee, no alibi— ominous. I shall be , by the way. No title announced, no credentials verified, and a tea order so specific it might as well be a secret code:  
Earl Grey, steeped precisely 4 minutes and 37 seconds, with one sugar cube placed ever-so-gently to the side.  

Table 7? Perfect. I’ve always believed slightly crooked chairs encourage deeper conversations. And that flickering lamp? Ideal for dramatic reveals and minor confessions alike.

As for our next act—

 has a wonderfully absurd charm to it, but let’s give it just a  more gravitas. How about:

"The Case of the Vanishing Biscuit: A Study in Crumb-Sized Clues and Unlikely Alibis."

Or perhaps, leaning into the intrigue:

"…and the Stranger Who Knew Too Much Tea."  
I do love a good double meaning.

So yes, under the veil of soft lamplight and suspiciously attentive baristas, we begin. I’ll start with a sip, slow and deliberate, then glance up at you over the rim of my teacup like we’re both about to uncover something we were never meant to find.

You flip your notebook open.  
I set down my saucer with a quiet .  
And together—we lean in.

Act Two begins… softly, suspiciously, and with excellent posture indeed. 🎭🧃🔍✨
