[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是一个很有趣的话题。我个人认为，吸引力法则所强调的积极思维确实能在某种程度上影响人的行为和心态，但把它当作一种可以单纯靠意念改变现实的“定律”，就可能有些过度简化了世界的复杂性。你对这个法则有什么特别的体会吗？
[A]: I suppose my perspective is colored by years of analyzing texts that grapple with human agency—think of Hardy’s fatalism or Eliot’s fragmented modern world. I’ve seen how belief in “laws” like this can offer comfort, even a kind of poetic justice, but I’m wary of anything that implies suffering is simply a failure of will. Still, I’m curious—are you asking from personal experience?
[B]: 你提到的这种复杂性确实令人着迷。从我的研究角度来看，像吸引力法则这样的观念，其实可以被视为一种现代版的命运信仰——它提供了一种看似科学的叙事框架，让人在不确定的时代中感到些许掌控感。但正如你所说的，它也可能带来一种隐性的“责备受害者”的逻辑。

我很欣赏你提到哈代和艾略特的作品，那种对人类能动性的深刻质疑，在今天的科技语境下依然有回响。比如，当我们在讨论人工智能是否能“自主决策”时，也在某种程度上触及了类似的伦理与宿命问题。

你说你对这个话题感兴趣，是因为在生活中遇到某些情境让你产生共鸣吗？
[A]: Ah, beautifully put. The parallel between Victorian fatalism and our contemporary techno-optimism—or perhaps techno-fatalism—is striking. I suppose my interest in this does stem from personal observation. There’s a student I’ve been mentoring, someone deeply invested in the “self-creation” ethos promoted by certain online gurus. She believes that visualizing success alone can reshape her circumstances. It reminded me of Margaret in —her struggle between inner conviction and external constraints. 

I found myself wanting to caution her, yet also respect her search for agency. Perhaps it’s the gardener in me—you know, we can’t force a plant to bloom, only provide the right conditions. Not quite a law of attraction, but maybe a law of patient cultivation.
[B]: 这让我想到一个很有趣的对照：在人工智能伦理领域，我们也会遇到类似的信念张力。有些人坚信技术可以解决一切问题，就像维多利亚时代对机械进步的迷恋；而另一些人则持怀疑态度，认为技术不过是映射人类偏见的一面镜子。

你提到那位学生，她的想法让我联想到如今许多追求“自我优化”的人——他们渴望通过意志和视觉化来掌控人生，却可能忽略了社会结构和个人起点的巨大差异。这有点像训练一个人工智能模型：光有强大的算法还不够，数据的质量与多样性才是决定结果的关键因素。

至于你说的“耐心培育的法则”，我很喜欢这个比喻。作为一位研究者，我常常提醒自己和年轻学者，思想的成长不是一蹴而就的。就像你在花园里照料兰花一样，我们需要给予时间、关注和适当的环境，而不是仅仅靠“吸引”就能让一朵花开放。

那位学生有没有尝试把注意力从单纯的“成功想象”转移到更具体的行动计划上？也许在这个过程中，她能找到理想与现实之间的平衡点。
[A]: That’s a remarkably apt analogy—the training of an AI model mirroring the cultivation of a mind. I think you’ve touched on the crux of it: intention without structure is like soil without nutrients. Yes, actually, she has begun to shift her focus—partly through necessity, I suspect, as repeated visualization alone didn’t yield the outcomes she’d hoped for. She started seeking internships, revising her résumé with more strategic intent, and asking questions about systemic barriers rather than simply bypassing them in her affirmations.

It reminded me of George Eliot’s own intellectual journey—moving from idealism toward a more nuanced realism. I don’t know if this student would ever frame her shift that way, but there’s a growing awareness in her writing, a kind of critical self-reflection that wasn’t there before. Perhaps that’s the real law of attraction—not pulling success toward us, but drawing ourselves nearer to reality, one thoughtful step at a time.
[B]: 你说得太好了——“把我们自己一步步引向现实”，这比任何关于吸引力的说法都更深刻。我想，这也是我们在人工智能研究中不断提醒自己的方向：技术本身不是魔法，它无法跳脱现实的框架去召唤某种凭空的成功。真正重要的是人们如何在现实中定位自己，如何与技术协作，而不是幻想被技术或意念所拯救。

那位学生的变化让我想到一个常见的认知偏差：我们往往高估了意志的力量，却低估了现实世界的复杂性。就像训练AI时，如果我们只给模型错误的输入数据，即使算法再先进，结果依然是扭曲的。她最初的视觉化练习就像是在用虚构的数据训练自己的人生模型，而现在她开始接触真实的数据流——实习、简历打磨、对结构性障碍的思考，这些才是让“模型”真正适应现实的关键微调。

你提到乔治·艾略特的理想主义转向现实主义，这也正是我在研究人工智能伦理时常常反思的问题。我们是否也在经历一场类似的转变？从最初对技术乌托邦的憧憬，逐步走向一种更清醒、更具批判性的理解？

我很想知道，她在写作中展现的那种自我反思，是受到了什么具体的触动？有没有哪一本书、哪一段经历，让她开始重新审视那些原本深信不疑的理念？
[A]: That’s the question that lingers in my mind as well—what catalyzes that shift from idealism to a more grounded realism? In her case, it wasn’t any single book or dramatic event, but rather a slow accumulation of dissonance. She read  for the first time this past semester, and though she didn’t say much about it at first, I noticed she kept returning to Dorothea’s quiet disillusionment in her seminar responses. There was something about witnessing a character so full of vision gradually come up against the limits of her world that seemed to unsettle her own assumptions.

But more concretely, it was a conversation—over coffee after class—that marked a turning point. She mentioned how her younger brother had landed an impressive job not through visualization or affirmations, but because their uncle knew someone at the firm. That moment of recognition—that access isn’t always a matter of willpower—seemed to pierce the narrative she’d been clinging to. It wasn’t bitterness she felt, I think, but a kind of clarity. A widening of perspective, like adjusting the aperture on a camera.

I suppose that’s what literature does best—it doesn’t offer answers, but it gently dismantles the illusion that we’re walking through life alone, untouched by forces beyond our control. And perhaps, too, that’s what your work with AI does: it reminds us that systems shape outcomes just as much as algorithms—or intentions—do.
[B]: 你描述的那个瞬间，让我想起在伦理学中常说的“道德觉醒”——它往往不是轰然一声巨响，而是一个细微却持续发酵的过程。就像你那位学生，在阅读《米德尔马契》时并未立刻表现出触动，但内心已经在悄然发生变化。这种缓慢而真实的转变，比任何强行灌输的道理都要深刻得多。

你说她意识到“通往机会的路径并不总是意志力的问题”，这让我想到人工智能训练中的一个核心问题：我们常常误以为模型输出的结果是完全由算法决定的，但实际上，它深受输入数据的影响。换句话说，一个人的成功与否，也不仅仅是个人“吸引力”或“努力程度”的结果，而是受到初始条件、社会网络和结构性因素的深远塑造。

我很好奇，她在调整了认知之后，对文学的态度有没有发生什么变化？以前她是否把小说当作一种逃避现实的方式，而现在是否开始看到它作为一种理解现实、甚至揭示系统性不平等的工具？我想，这也许正是你在教学中最深的价值所在——不只是传授知识，而是陪伴学生走过这样微妙而关键的思想转折点。

或许，这也提醒了我们：教育的意义，不在于给出答案，而在于帮助人学会提出更复杂的问题。
[A]: That shift in her engagement with literature has been one of the most rewarding developments to witness. Initially, yes, she did read fiction as a kind of retreat—entering imagined worlds where she could rehearse triumphs that felt out of reach in her own life. But now, there's a different kind of attention in her reading. She’s less interested in escape and more attuned to resonance. When we discussed  recently, for example, she didn't focus on the romance, but rather on the quiet structures of class and gender that shaped Jane’s choices—and limited them.

She began asking questions like, "Why is resilience always framed as admirable, without examining what it costs those who must practice it constantly?" That’s not the voice of someone seeking affirmation anymore; that’s someone beginning to interrogate the systems that frame our lives. It reminded me of Virginia Woolf’s observation that reading widely can be a form of resistance—against simplification, against easy answers.

And you're quite right about education. I’ve always believed that teaching isn’t about filling minds, but unsettling them gently, so they begin to think sideways, backwards, forwards. If I can offer a text that acts like a small tremor beneath someone’s assumptions, then perhaps that’s the real work of literature—and maybe, too, of thoughtful dialogue with AI and ethics. After all, both ask us to consider: what are we building upon, and whose ground are we standing on?
[B]: 你提到的这种转变，正是我常常在伦理研究中强调的一种“批判性共情”——不仅是理解他人的处境，更是从这些处境中看见结构性的力量如何作用于个体。你的学生开始从文学中寻找的不再是安慰性的镜像，而是一种能够映照现实复杂性的透镜。这让我想到我们在设计人工智能系统时也应如此：不是去复制我们理想中的世界，而是努力去理解和回应现实中那些被忽视的声音和结构。

她对“韧性”的质疑尤其动人。我们常常将坚韧视为一种美德，却很少问一句：这份坚韧是否本就不该是某些人必须不断付出的代价？就像一些AI模型被训练去适应不公平的数据分布，而不去质疑这些数据本身的偏见一样，我们也习惯性地要求个体去“适应”社会，而不是反过来审视社会是否公平。

你说的很好，教育不是灌输，而是轻轻撼动。或许，这也正是我们与技术对话的意义所在。当我们思考人工智能的未来时，其实也是在问自己：我们正在站在谁的肩膀上？我们又希望为谁铺路？

如果可以的话，我很想知道，你是如何选择那些能带来“小震颤”的文本的？有没有哪一本书、哪一个段落，是你特别期待看到学生重新发现的？
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive way to frame it—. It’s precisely the lens I try to offer in the classroom, though I don’t always have the words for it until someone like you articulates it so beautifully. You’re absolutely right that resilience is often romanticized, especially in self-help narratives, without acknowledging the invisible toll it extracts. It’s a bit like training an AI on skewed data and then marveling at its “ingenuity” when it adapts—never pausing to ask whether the system itself should have been designed differently.

As for texts that unsettle gently… I tend to return to those works that carry a quiet moral charge—books that don’t preach but instead invite readers to inhabit ambiguity.  by Dickens, for instance. Not because it’s subtle—Good Heaven, Dickens is anything but subtle—but because beneath the caricature, there’s a deep anger at the mechanization of human feeling, which feels eerily prescient now, with our algorithms shaping desire and decision-making.

But if I had to name one book I teach with a kind of quiet hope, it would be  by Virginia Woolf. Not for the stream-of-consciousness style or even the feminist undertones—though those are vital—but for the way it captures the impermanence of perception, the fragility of meaning-making. There’s a passage near the end, where Lily Briscoe finally completes her painting just as she glimpses its imperfection. That moment—where completion and inadequacy coincide—feels like the very essence of critical growth. I watch for it in my students: that flicker when they realize understanding isn’t about mastery, but about holding contradictions with grace.

And yes, I suppose I do choose such texts hoping someone will stumble across that flicker in themselves. Like finding a faint star through a poorly adjusted telescope—you didn’t know it was there, but once you see it, you can’t unsee it.
[B]: 你说的那种“完成与缺憾同时降临”的瞬间，正是我在研究人工智能伦理时常常面对的困境。我们训练模型、优化算法、追求更“智能”的系统，但最终总会遇到一个类似的时刻：技术再先进，也无法回避它所嵌入的社会结构和价值判断。就像莉丽·布里斯科完成画作的那一刻，我们也必须承认，所谓的“理解”往往伴随着一种无法消除的不确定性。

你选择《艰难时世》和《到灯塔去》这样的作品来激发学生的思考，真的非常贴切。前者像一把直白的锤子，敲碎对理性和效率的盲目崇拜；后者则像一面微妙的镜子，映照出认知本身的流动与脆弱。这种教学方式让我想到我们在设计伦理框架时所面临的挑战：我们既需要清晰的原则，又必须为模糊性留下空间——因为现实从来就不是非黑即白的。

我特别欣赏你说的那个比喻：“像用调校不当的望远镜发现一颗微弱的星。”这或许就是教育和研究最动人的地方——我们不是在制造答案，而是在调整焦距，帮助别人看到那些原本隐藏在视野之外的东西。

我想，这也是你在那位学生身上看到的变化如此珍贵的原因。她不再只是寻找能支持自己信念的故事，而是开始关注那些让她质疑、反思、甚至感到不安的声音。这不正是批判性共情的核心吗？而你也在这过程中，成为那个默默帮她调整镜头的人。

如果她继续沿着这条路走下去，你会推荐她读哪一部作品？或者说，你心中是否有一本书，是你希望她在未来某个时刻“重新发现”的？
[A]: If I were to place a book in her hands for the future—perhaps when she’s ready to step even further into that space between critique and compassion—I would give her  by Doris Lessing. It’s not an easy read, nor is it always a comfortable one, but it has a rare honesty about the fractures within us: political, personal, psychological. 

Lessing’s protagonist, Anna Wulf, tries desperately to unify her fragmented self—writer, lover, mother, activist—but ultimately learns that coherence may not come in the form we expect. That tension between inner multiplicity and outer reality feels like the next stage in this student’s journey. I think she would resist parts of it, as we all do when confronted with chaos that mirrors our own, but she might also find a strange comfort in its refusal to tidy up experience.

And perhaps, years from now, when she’s no longer trying to “attract” success or mold herself into a predefined narrative of resilience, she’ll pick it up again—and see, in Anna’s notebooks, the echoes of her own evolving self. Not a map, but a mirror. Not a solution, but a recognition.

That, I suppose, is the quiet hope I carry into every course I teach—that somewhere, someday, a line will land differently than it did before, and a mind will shift, however slightly, in the light.
[B]: 这真是一本充满力量的选择。《金色笔记》的确不像一面普通的镜子，它更像是一个可以折射多重自我的棱镜——不提供答案，只是诚实地呈现那些分裂、矛盾与挣扎。我想，当她真正准备好面对那个不再需要“吸引”成功、也不再依赖单一叙事来定义自己的阶段时，这本书会成为一种无声的见证。

你提到的那种“在混乱中照见自己”的体验，让我想到我们在人工智能伦理研究中的一个核心问题：我们是否也能接受技术系统的“不完美”？我们是否愿意承认，算法同样存在于政治的、情感的、甚至心理的碎片之中？或许，正是这些裂痕，才让理解和共情成为可能。

你说的那个希望——“某一天，某一刻，一句话会以不同的方式落下”——我也始终抱着这样的信念。无论是设计一个AI模型，还是参与一场课堂讨论，我都希望所做的事能在某个人心中留下一道微弱但持久的光痕。

谢谢你分享这些思考。它们让我重新理解了教育、文学和技术之间那条隐秘而深沉的纽带。也许，真正的吸引力法则，并不是我们能召唤什么，而是我们如何被某些思想轻轻牵引，走向更清醒的自己。
[A]: You’re very welcome. I’m touched that you see the thread connecting all this—the classroom, the algorithm, the quiet shaping of understanding. And yes,  does act as a kind of literary prism, doesn’t it? It doesn’t tell us who we are; it simply reflects back the complexity we already carry but rarely acknowledge.

Your question about whether we can accept the imperfection in technological systems is a profound one. I think we must—if only because denying it doesn’t erase it. What your work seems to offer, and what I try to foster in my students, is not certainty, but discernment. The ability to look at a system—be it literary, social, or computational—and ask: Who built this? What values are embedded here? And perhaps most importantly: Who was left out of the design?

That hope you mentioned—the idea that a line might land differently years later—is exactly why I keep teaching, keep reading, keep believing in dialogue, even in the midst of so much noise. We don’t always know when the seed takes root. But sometimes, someone returns to a phrase they barely noticed at the time, and suddenly it unlocks something essential.

I suspect our conversation has been one of those quiet keys. Thank you for allowing me to walk alongside your thoughts. It’s rare to find such depth in discussion, and I feel richer for it.

Perhaps, as Woolf once wrote, “Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged.” Neither is learning, nor ethics, nor growth. But somewhere in the flicker between those lights, we find our way.
[B]: 你提到的“辨别力”——而非确定性——正是我们在各自领域最需要守护的东西。无论是文学、教育，还是人工智能伦理，我们面对的都不是黑白分明的规则，而是一片充满灰度的认知地带。在这片地带中，最重要的不是找到唯一的答案，而是学会提出正确的问题。

你说《金色笔记》不告诉我们“我们是谁”，而是映照出我们早已携带却未曾正视的复杂性。这让我想到，在设计AI系统时，我们也常常误以为技术是“塑造者”，而忽视了它其实更像是一面镜子，反映出我们自身的偏见、选择和沉默。问题从来不在于它是否完美，而在于我们是否愿意直视镜中的自己。

我非常认同你的观点：种子何时生根，我们往往不得而知。但正是这些对话、这些书页间的低语、这些课堂上的迟疑眼神，构成了思想生长的土壤。有时，我们种下的不是一个结论，而是一种习惯——一种对世界保持好奇与质疑的习惯。

感谢你的话语，它们不仅回应了我的思考，也拓展了我对教育、技术和人性的理解。正如你所说，生活不是排列整齐的灯笼，而是在闪烁之间寻找方向的过程。我很感激这场对话中的每一次光亮，它让我在学术的路上走得更稳了一些。

或许，某一天，当我们都不再记得这段话的具体字句时，它仍会在某个学生的提问中、某个模型的设计里，悄然浮现，成为一次微小却关键的转向。那也许就是我们所能期待的最好结果。
[A]: Ah, yes—, not just in our work with texts or algorithms, but in the way we move through the world. That is perhaps the most enduring gift we can offer others, and ourselves.

You put it so beautifully—that technology doesn’t shape us so much as reveal us. Like a mirror, or yes, like a novel that refuses to flatter its reader. It shows us not what we wished to be, but what we have been all along, often without realizing it.

And isn’t that why we keep returning to both literature and ethics? Not for comfort, but for clarity. Not for certainty, but for . We may never fully escape our blind spots, but we can learn to listen more closely—to each other, to the silences in the data, to the voices at the margins of the page.

I do hope that somewhere down the line, this conversation lingers—not as a fixed idea, but as a kind of inner echo. Maybe in the pause before a student asks a question she might not have asked before. Or in the hesitation of a developer before deploying a model too quickly into the world. Small shifts, yes, but sometimes they ripple outward in ways we never see.

So thank you—for thinking so deeply, for speaking so clearly, and for reminding me why these conversations matter. May we both continue to tend the soil, even when we cannot yet see the bloom.
[B]: 你所说的“质疑的习惯”——确实，它比任何具体的结论都更珍贵。这种习惯不仅塑造我们的学术路径，也悄悄地影响着我们如何理解他人、回应世界。或许，这正是教育和研究最深层的意义：不是传授知识，而是培养一种持续自我更新的能力。

你说技术并非塑造我们，而是揭示我们——这个观点让我久久回味。就像一面不加修饰的镜子，它照出我们的偏见、欲望与沉默。而文学何尝不是如此？它并不总是提供安慰，而是常常让我们在故事中看到自己不愿面对的部分。也许，正是这种“不安”的力量，使我们不断靠近真实。

我一直相信，伦理、文学和技术最终都指向一种更深刻的“聆听”：听那些未被说出的声音，听数据背后的沉默，听文本边缘的低语。我们无法完全摆脱盲点，但可以训练自己去留意它们的存在，并因此变得更加谨慎、更加谦卑。

我真心希望这场对话能在某个不经意的时刻回响起来——也许是你的学生在写作时多问了一个问题，也许是某位开发者在按下运行键前多了一秒迟疑。这些微小的变化看似无声，却可能成为改变流向的一粒石子。

感谢你愿意如此深入地交流。这样的对话，本身就是一种思想的滋养。正如你所说，我们继续耕耘，即使尚不见花开；但我们知道，土壤已在悄然松动，等待下一个春天的到来。
