[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, 最近真的读到一篇很有意思的文章，发表在《Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology》上 👀 讨论的是不同文化背景下学生如何develop their sense of self-efficacy in learning。老实说，看完之后我甚至想给作者发邮件，讨论能不能把这套理论应用到我们现在的教学实践里 🤔  

说到这儿，你最近有读到什么让你眼前一亮的内容吗？I'm always looking for new recommendations.
[A]: That does sound intriguing, particularly the implications for pedagogical approaches across cultures. I must admit, my recent readings have taken a slightly different turn—last week I finished a compelling case study published in . It examined the interplay between early-onset personality disorders and competency to stand trial. The authors presented some rather nuanced findings regarding malingering assessments in high-stress legal environments.

I found myself rereading a section on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist–Revised just yesterday—it never ceases to amaze me how subtle the diagnostic boundaries can be.  

Actually, this reminds me, there’s a chapter in a new edited volume by Dr. Gwen Adshead that might interest you—she draws fascinating parallels between narrative identity and decision-making capacity in clinical-legal contexts. Would you be open to a brief summary?
[B]: Oh wow, that does sound like a deep dive into some complex territory. I have to say, the way you describe it——reminds me a bit of the challenges we face in cross-cultural assessment. It’s all about context, right? Like, what reads as  in one setting might be totally  in another 🤔  

And yes, please—I’d love to hear a quick summary of Adshead’s chapter. Always down for interdisciplinary connections, especially when they touch on narrative identity. That’s something we talk a lot about in education too—how students construct their own , so to speak. It might be interesting to see how that translates in a clinical-legal framework.  

By the way, do you find yourself applying any of those forensic insights directly in your work? 😊
[A]: Absolutely—spot on. Context  the fulcrum, isn't it? In forensic settings, misreading that context can mean the difference between a valid diagnosis and a catastrophic misattribution. I’ve seen cases where culturally patterned behavior was mistaken for psychopathology—not because of incompetence, but simply due to a lack of narrative grounding.

As for Adshead’s chapter, let me briefly distill it: she argues that narrative identity—the way individuals construct and internalize their life stories—is not merely a psychological phenomenon, but a . When evaluating someone's decision-making capacity, especially in legally compromised states (e.g., after trauma or under coercion), understanding their narrative coherence—or lack thereof—can illuminate whether their choices are authentic or influenced by pathology. She illustrates this with a case study involving a detainee accused of self-harm while incarcerated. His entire defense hinged on the idea that his actions were not volitional, but a fragmented expression of past abuse. The court ultimately accepted a more nuanced verdict thanks to the integration of narrative analysis into the psychiatric evaluation.

Fascinating, no?

And yes—to your question—I do apply these insights directly. In fact, just last month I consulted on a competency hearing where the defendant’s sense of agency had been eroded by prolonged exposure to domestic violence. Traditional assessments didn’t capture the full picture, but when we mapped her personal narrative alongside clinical findings, the patterns became clear. It’s not just about what people do—it’s about how they come to  what they've done.
[B]: That’s incredibly powerful stuff. Thanks for sharing that summary—I can already see the  you mentioned earlier 👀  

You know, when we talk about narrative identity in education, it’s often framed around motivation or self-concept. But Adshead’s take—narrative as a forensic tool—adds this whole other layer. It makes me think about students who come from marginalized backgrounds and how their  are often misread or fragmented because of systemic biases. In a way, educators also have to be careful not to mistake resilience for resistance, or silence for disengagement.  

And I love that line:  That could easily apply to a student struggling with failure—they might be doing all the right things, but if their internal narrative frames those actions as "not enough," then we’re looking at a kind of emotional incoherence.  

I wonder... do you think narrative coherence could be used proactively—like in early intervention programs? Or would that risk overstepping into territory where interpretation could become too subjective? 🤔
[A]: That’s a superb question—and one that sits at the heart of an ongoing debate in both forensic and educational psychology. Can narrative coherence be used proactively? I’d say yes, but with careful scaffolding.

In early intervention settings—whether in schools or clinical outreach programs—narrative can serve as a kind of psychological barometer. When a child consistently frames their experiences through a lens of helplessness or fatalism, for example, it may signal underlying emotional distress long before behavioral issues emerge. The key is not to interpret the narrative  them, but to help them articulate it with greater clarity and agency. That’s where the line between support and overinterpretation becomes critical.

I’ve worked with school systems where teachers are trained to listen for narrative fragmentation in student writing or verbal expression. Not in a diagnostic sense, mind you—but as part of a holistic approach to emotional well-being. A student who writes, “I just never get anything right, no matter how hard I try,” might not be expressing a temporary frustration, but a deeply internalized belief that affects learning behavior. Identifying that early allows educators to respond with targeted support rather than disciplinary assumptions.

Of course, subjectivity is always a risk. That’s why any narrative-based intervention needs to be paired with structured assessment tools and cultural sensitivity training. We’re not storytellers interpreting meaning ex nihilo—we’re collaborators helping individuals make sense of their own stories.

Actually, this makes me curious—have you ever seen this kind of narrative tracking implemented formally in educational settings? Or has it mostly been informal observation?
[B]: Oh, I love how you framed that—as . That’s so spot-on. It really does shift the role of the educator or clinician from an evaluator to more of a narrative guide 🤔  

To your question—yes, I’ve seen some formal attempts at narrative tracking in educational settings, especially in trauma-informed schools and programs for refugee & immigrant youth. One example that comes to mind is a project I consulted on a few years back, where middle school students were engaged in weekly reflective journaling as part of their social-emotional learning curriculum. The prompts were designed to encourage not just emotional expression, but —things like “What helped you keep going this week?” or “When did you surprise yourself lately?”

Teachers were trained to look for patterns—not in a clinical-diagnostic way, but more as part of building relational awareness. And honestly, some of the most powerful insights came not from standardized assessments, but from those journals. A student might write something like, “I didn’t cry today when I messed up my math test,” which on the surface sounds small, but in the context of their larger story? Huge progress.  

I think what made it work was the consistency and the emphasis on . There was no push to "fix" the narrative, just space to  it.  

So yeah, while it’s definitely not foolproof—and yes, subjectivity is always lurking—it can be done thoughtfully. I’d even argue it’s one of the most culturally responsive tools we have… if we’re willing to listen carefully, of course 😊  

Have you seen similar models used in forensic-adjacent education settings, like alternative-to-incarceration programs or youth courts?
[A]: Fascinating—your description of that journaling project is remarkably aligned with some of the more progressive models I’ve encountered in forensic-adjacent education. In fact, yes—similar narrative-based approaches are being used, albeit cautiously, in alternative-to-incarceration programs and youth courts, particularly those emphasizing restorative justice and trauma-informed practices.

One program I’ve followed closely operates within a juvenile diversion framework in Oregon. They integrate narrative reflection into weekly group sessions where participants—many of whom have had prior court involvement—are guided through structured storytelling exercises. The prompts are deceptively simple:  or  But over time, these reflections begin to form a kind of evolving self-map. Clinicians and mentors then use those narratives—not as evidence, but as touchpoints—for building insight and accountability rooted in personal meaning rather than external judgment.

I was involved, tangentially, in an evaluation of that program’s outcomes. What we found was compelling: participants who engaged consistently with the narrative component showed greater improvements in emotional regulation and prosocial decision-making compared to those in more traditional cognitive-behavioral tracks. And notably, recidivism rates were lower in that cohort over a 12-month follow-up period.

The key difference, I think, lies in how authority is positioned. In a conventional forensic assessment, the expert interprets the subject. In these narrative-guided models, the individual becomes the narrator of their own transformation. It’s not about diagnosing pathology—it’s about witnessing agency.  

And yes, just like in education, it requires training facilitators to listen deeply without imposing meaning too quickly. That’s always the tightrope walk, isn’t it?
[B]: Absolutely — that’s exactly the tightrope. And I love how you put it:  That line honestly deserves its own article title 🤭  

It reminds me of a concept from educational psychology called  — the idea that students bring rich, often untapped narratives rooted in their lived experiences, and those narratives can be powerful tools for learning and growth. When we start seeing those stories not as deficits but as assets, everything shifts — from assessment to intervention to support systems.

I can totally see how that plays out in juvenile programs too. In fact, it makes me wonder if some of these narrative-guided models could be adapted even earlier — like in elementary school SEL (social-emotional learning) curricula. Imagine building that kind of reflective capacity and emotional awareness from a young age… It might not prevent every issue, but it could definitely build better resilience and self-awareness.

And yeah, the facilitator training piece is huge. I always tell my grad students:  Active listening is a skill that needs just as much attention as any clinical or pedagogical technique.

By the way — do you ever use narrative reflection in your own supervision or mentoring sessions with clinicians-in-training? I’d imagine it could add a whole new layer to professional development 🧠
[A]: That’s a wonderfully generative thought—integrating narrative reflection into SEL curricula at the elementary level. I’d argue we’re missing a critical window if we wait until adolescence to cultivate that kind of self-awareness. If we can scaffold reflective practices early, we may not only enhance emotional resilience but also reduce the likelihood of maladaptive coping strategies later on.

To your question about supervision and mentoring: yes, absolutely—I do incorporate narrative reflection with clinicians-in-training, though I tend to frame it as  rather than something overtly therapeutic. The idea is that every clinician develops their own professional identity through a series of formative experiences—some affirming, some destabilizing—and how they narrate those experiences often reveals more than any competency checklist ever could.

For example, during our weekly supervision sessions, I’ll sometimes pose a prompt like,  That opens up space for them to reflect not just on technique or intervention, but on presence, intuition, and the subtle shifts in relational dynamics. It also surfaces implicit biases or unresolved personal narratives that might be influencing their clinical stance.

One trainee, early in her placement, described feeling “stuck” with a client who kept canceling sessions. Through unpacking that narrative, she realized the frustration wasn’t just about missed appointments—it was tied to an internalized fear of being unreliable herself, stemming from childhood experiences with illness in her family. That insight didn’t just improve her work with the client; it deepened her capacity for self-compassion, which is no small thing in high-stress fields like ours.

So yes, I see narrative reflection as an essential part of professional development—not just for what it reveals, but for how it strengthens the muscle of self-understanding. And honestly? That’s one of the great joys of mentoring—watching someone begin to trust their own story enough to let it guide their practice.
[B]: That’s beautifully put— I think that line could resonate far beyond clinical training. Honestly, that could be the tagline for any kind of transformative learning experience 🎵  

It’s so true—when we give people space to reflect narratively, we’re not just hearing about what happened; we’re uncovering how they make sense of it. And that’s where growth lives, right? Not in the event itself, but in the meaning-making around it.

I’ve tried something similar with pre-service teachers during their practicum placements. Instead of the usual “What went well? What would you change?” debriefs, I encouraged them to tell me a short story from their week—one that stayed with them for better or worse. Some talked about a student who finally smiled after weeks of silence; others shared moments of self-doubt that felt almost too raw to voice at first.

But over time, those stories became touchstones. One teacher candidate kept coming back to a moment when a student said, “You actually listened to me.” That single line ended up shaping how she approached classroom management and relationship-building—not as strategies, but as extensions of her teaching identity.

So yeah, whether it’s with clinicians, educators, or students themselves, narrative reflection has this quiet power to surface what really matters. It's not flashy—it doesn't come with a rubric or a score—but man, does it stick.  

I wonder… have you ever seen narrative reflection used in interdisciplinary supervision settings? Like when educators and clinicians are working with the same student or client? There’s something rich there, don’t you think? 😊
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. There’s something profoundly integrative about narrative reflection when it crosses disciplinary lines. When educators and clinicians engage in shared narrative supervision—really  to each other’s stories about the same student or client—it can dissolve silos of interpretation that so often lead to fragmented care or misaligned interventions.

I’ve worked within a few interdisciplinary teams where this was practiced intentionally, particularly in settings serving youth with complex trauma histories. One example that comes to mind was a school-based mental health initiative I consulted on several years ago. The model included biweekly case conferences where classroom teachers, school counselors, and external clinicians would gather—not to diagnose or assign blame, but to share observational narratives.

Each person would describe a recent moment with the student that stood out to them emotionally, not just behaviorally. A teacher might recount a quiet exchange during roll call that seemed insignificant at first, while a clinician noted how the same student had referenced feeling “invisible” in therapy just days before. When those two moments were placed side by side, a richer emotional arc emerged—one neither party could have seen alone.

What made it effective was that no one voice dominated. It wasn’t about who had the “correct” interpretation; it was about building a , if you will—a shared understanding grounded in empathy rather than expertise. That kind of collaboration doesn’t just improve outcomes—it builds institutional humility.

And interestingly, I noticed that after several months of these sessions, the language people used began to shift. Teachers started describing students with more psychological nuance, and clinicians began framing their insights through educational contexts they hadn’t previously considered. It was subtle, but powerful—a kind of mutual narrative osmosis.

So yes, I do think there’s something deeply rich there. Perhaps even a new frontier for integrated care models. After all, if we’re serious about supporting the whole person, we must first learn to see the whole story.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself— That’s the kind of language that makes my educator heart skip a beat 🎶

I think what you described—the  between teachers and clinicians—is exactly what so many systems are missing. We tend to silo ourselves into our professional lenses, right? The teacher sees behavior through the academic lens, the clinician through the emotional one… but the student? They’re living it all at once.

That reminds me of a phrase I heard at a conference last year:  At the time, it felt a bit buzzword-y, but now I really see what they meant. When we take the time to sit with multiple narratives—to hold space for different perspectives—we start to see the person behind the labels.

And honestly, that kind of listening is an act of respect. It says, 

I’d love to see more formal structures for that kind of interdisciplinary narrative supervision—maybe even embedded in teacher prep programs or clinical training rotations. Can you imagine if every new teacher came into the classroom already trained to collaborate narratively with support staff? What a world that would be 💡  

Do you think there’s room for something like that in higher ed too? Like, when faculty and student support services work with struggling undergrads? I get the sense the same principles might apply...
[A]: I couldn’t agree more— is not just a phrase; it’s a practice, one that we often pay lip service to but rarely institutionalize in any meaningful way.

You're absolutely right to extend this thinking into higher education. If anything, the need for interdisciplinary narrative supervision is even more pronounced at the undergraduate level, where students are navigating immense developmental shifts—academic, emotional, social, and often economic—all at once. And yet, the systems designed to support them remain stubbornly siloed. A faculty member might see a student as “disengaged”; an advisor might label them “undecided”; a clinician might note “elevated anxiety.” But unless those perspectives converge narratively, the student remains fragmented in our collective understanding of them.

I’ve seen early prototypes of this kind of collaboration emerging in some university wellness centers that partner directly with academic departments. One model I observed at a liberal arts college involved monthly narrative case rounds—faculty, counselors, academic coaches, and even peer mentors would gather to discuss students of concern, not through formal diagnoses or performance metrics, but by sharing qualitative observations. The prompt was always the same: 

The result? A much richer, more humane picture of the student. One professor shared how a quiet student had hesitated before asking a question in class—something she hadn’t thought much of until a counselor noted that the student had described feeling “terrified of being wrong” in recent sessions. That small narrative thread reframed what could have been dismissed as disengagement into something far more nuanced: intellectual vulnerability masked as silence.

So yes, there’s not just room for this in higher ed—there’s a pressing need. Faculty may not traditionally see themselves as part of a student’s emotional ecosystem, but the truth is, they . Every comment on a paper, every office-hour conversation, every tone of voice—they all contribute to a student’s internal narrative about belonging and capability.

And if we trained faculty to see their role through that narrative lens—if we gave them the tools to listen across disciplines and engage with student stories in partnership with support services—we wouldn’t just be improving retention rates. We’d be cultivating a culture of meaning-making that supports not just academic success, but human resilience.

Now that, my friend, would be a truly transformative shift.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better— That line honestly deserves its own symposium 🤯  

It makes me think of how often we reduce student “success” to GPA or graduation rates, when in reality, the deeper metric is —does the student feel like they belong? Like their story matters? Like their struggles are seen and supported—not just diagnosed or tracked?

I love how you framed faculty as part of the emotional ecosystem. It’s so true. Even if they don’t carry a clinical title, they’re still shaping the affective landscape of learning every time they respond to an essay, engage in office hours, or even structure feedback.

Which actually makes me wonder—have you ever worked with faculty who were resistant to this kind of narrative approach at first, but then shifted once they experienced it firsthand? I’m always curious about how we bridge that gap between skepticism and buy-in, especially in more traditional academic settings.
[A]: Ah, now  is the million-dollar question, isn’t it? Bridging that gap between skepticism and genuine engagement—particularly among faculty who have spent decades in systems that prioritize objectivity, efficiency, and measurable outcomes—is both an art and a science.

And yes—to answer your question—I’ve definitely worked with faculty who were initially quite resistant to the idea of narrative reflection as anything more than a therapeutic indulgence. I recall one particularly memorable case involving a tenured professor of political science at a large public university. Let’s call him Dr. Ellis. He was brilliant, incisive, deeply committed to intellectual rigor—but when we first introduced the idea of incorporating narrative-informed supervision into his mentoring of graduate teaching assistants, he flat-out laughed.

His exact words? 

Now, mind you, he wasn’t being dismissive out of malice—he genuinely couldn’t see how narrative reflection could coexist with academic excellence. So rather than argue the point, we did what any good consultant does—we invited him to observe.

Over several weeks, he sat in on interdisciplinary supervision sessions where faculty from education, psychology, and even theater arts shared brief narrative reflections about their teaching moments—the ones that stayed with them, for better or worse. And slowly but surely, something shifted. Not all at once, but through accumulation.

One day, after a session where a junior lecturer described feeling emotionally unmoored after a heated classroom debate on race and policy, Dr. Ellis leaned over and whispered, 

That was the inflection point.

From there, we began experimenting with low-stakes narrative prompts during his own team meetings:  or  Nothing forced, nothing assessed—just open-ended invitations to reflect.

Over time, those questions started showing up in his feedback to TAs. One told me, half-jokingly, 

But here’s the thing—his students noticed too. His evaluations improved, not because he became “easier,” but because he became . The narrative lens didn’t soften his standards—it deepened his relational awareness. He still graded hard, still demanded rigor—but now, he did so with a clearer sense of the emotional terrain his students—and his TAs—were navigating.

So yes, resistance can shift. But only if we meet it with curiosity, not correction. Faculty like Dr. Ellis don’t need to become clinicians—they just need permission to see the human dimension of their work more clearly. And once they do? Well, let’s just say the lecture hall never sounds quite the same again.
[B]: Wow, what a beautifully told transformation—seriously,  is pure gold 🎻  

That story about Dr. Ellis really captures something so essential: people aren’t resistant to narrative—they’re resistant to feeling like it’s going to dilute their rigor or professionalism. But when you show them that narrative reflection isn’t fluff, but rather a deeper way of seeing? That’s when the shift happens.

I love how you approached it too—no pushback, no jargon, just invitation and observation. It reminds me of that saying:  And in academia, where intellectual distance is often prized, that kind of relational shift can feel revolutionary.

Honestly, I could see this model working not just with faculty, but across disciplines—instructional designers, student affairs professionals, even administrators. Imagine if deans started asking,  instead of just 

It makes me wonder—have you ever tried scaling this kind of narrative approach beyond individual departments? Like at an institutional level? I’m guessing it’s tricky, but maybe not impossible… 😊
[A]: Oh, now  is the trillion-dollar question—scaling narrative reflection beyond departments and into the very bloodstream of institutional culture. Tricky? Absolutely. Impossible? Not if we're willing to rethink how institutions define "evidence," "impact," and above all, "legitimacy."

I’ve had the opportunity—some might say the masochistic pleasure—of working on a few institutional-level initiatives that attempted just that. One in particular stands out: a multi-year project at a mid-sized research university aiming to embed narrative-informed practices across academic and student affairs. The provost, surprisingly, was a former clinical psychologist before entering administration, so she understood the terrain better than most.

We started small, as one must: with pilot programs rather than mandates. We invited faculty, advisors, career counselors, even facilities staff (!) to participate in what we called “Narrative Listening Circles.” No agenda beyond presence. No deliverables beyond shared reflection. Just structured prompts, deep listening, and a commitment to showing up as whole people rather than role carriers.

One of our favorite early exercises was asking participants to respond to this simple prompt:  
“Tell us about a moment when you saw a student—not just their work, but .”

What unfolded was remarkable. A biology professor described a student who always sat silently in the back row but once handed him a hand-drawn diagram of a cell membrane, captioned, “This is how I study—I turn things into pictures.” He’d never thought to ask her about it until then.

A custodian shared how he’d found a first-year student crying behind a storage closet door late one night and simply said, “You don’t have to talk, but I’m here if you do.” She came back the next week with a thank-you note tucked under his mop bucket.

These weren’t anomalies—they were invisible acts of care embedded in everyday interactions. And by bringing them into collective awareness, we began shifting the institution’s implicit theory of change: 

Of course, resistance remained. Some deans balked at the lack of quantifiable KPIs. Others questioned whether storytelling belonged in strategic planning. But then something unexpected happened: students started mentioning the circles in focus groups. They noticed subtle shifts—more eye contact, more intentional feedback, more “How are  doing?” before launching into business.

And slowly, the data followed. Retention rates in participating units trended upward modestly (not statistically significant, but directionally compelling). Faculty reported greater job satisfaction. Advisors noted earlier identification of at-risk students—not through algorithms, but through attunement.

So yes, scaling narrative approaches is messy. It requires patience, persistence, and thick skin. But it’s not impossible—if anything, it may be the quiet revolution higher ed desperately needs. Because institutions don’t change through top-down mandates alone; they change when enough people start telling—and listening to—a different kind of story.
[B]: Wow. Just… . That moment when a custodian becomes the unsung emotional anchor of a student’s week? That’s the kind of story that doesn’t show up in any accreditation report, but probably matters more than most of them combined 🤭  

I love how you put it— Honestly, that should be on every campus welcome banner.

And I totally get the pushback from deans and policymakers. We’re still so wedded to metrics that can be sliced, diced, and turned into a bar graph by Tuesday. But what your project shows is that narrative presence isn’t just soft stuff—it’s , , and  all in one.

What strikes me most is how this mirrors what we know about culturally responsive teaching: when students feel seen, they learn better. It seems like the same principle applies across the board—even for faculty, staff, and administrators. When people feel genuinely , not just evaluated or categorized, something shifts in the whole ecosystem.

And honestly, I’d argue that shift is contagious. Once you start hearing these stories—really hearing them—you can’t unhear them. You start noticing the human behind the role everywhere: in meetings, in emails, even in hallway greetings. And that awareness alone changes how we show up.

So yeah, scaling narrative listening is messy work. But maybe that’s the point. Because real change rarely fits neatly into a spreadsheet anyway 📊  

Do you think institutions are actually ready for that kind of deep cultural shift? Or do you still see it as a long game—one generation of leaders at a time?
