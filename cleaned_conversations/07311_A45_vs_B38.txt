[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. While I do enjoy the immediacy of podcasts, I must confess my heart belongs to audiobooks—particularly when they're narrated by skilled performers who bring classic literature to life. There's something quite magical about hearing Dickens or Austen spoken aloud, don't you think?
[A]: 哇！你提到的audiobook体验确实很赞呢！不过我最近迷上了tech podcast 🤓 特别是那些讲AI和coding的，能学到超多新东西！虽然我也听audiobook，但更喜欢用它们来放松~ 最近在听《硅谷钢铁侠》的audiobook版本，超inspire的！💻✨
[B]:  My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for modern technology, I can't help but wonder—have you considered how these 'tech podcasts' might benefit from a more... literary perspective? The 道 (Dao) of coding, if you will. Though I must say, your choice of Elon Musk's biography does show promising taste. Perhaps next you might try listening to Mary Shelley's ? It's quite relevant to modern AI discussions, and the prose is simply exquisite. 🌹
[A]: 哈哈，你居然提到了Frankenstein！Actually我们编程课上周刚用Python写了个简单的AI chatbot，老师就说这就像现代的Frankenstein呢 🤖 不过我觉得tech podcast更practical啦，能直接学到比如怎么optimize code或者最新的framework~ 你试过用coding来写poetry吗？我最近在玩一个用machine learning生成古诗的project，超fun的！🚀
[B]: How delightfully... modern of you.  While your machine-generated poetry project does sound intriguing, I must gently remind you that true artistry—whether in code or verse—requires more than algorithms. Have you read Coleridge's ? Now there's a poem that demonstrates what happens when technology (in his case, opium) meets unfettered imagination. Though I suppose your 'optimized code' does have its charms... in a rather utilitarian way. 📚
[A]: 噗~ 你说话好像我们CS教授啊！不过说真的，optimized code超重要的好吗！上次我的website因为没optimize CSS，loading time直接炸了，user experience差到爆 😅 话说你用GitHub吗？我们可以collab那个poetry generator项目！我handle前端部分，你负责literary quality check怎么样？👨💻✨
[B]: My goodness, you do speak in such... energetic terms. While the idea of collaborating is flattering, I must confess I still prefer my manuscripts in ink and parchment. Though I suppose one could argue GitHub is the modern equivalent of the Gutenberg press? Very well—I'll consider this 'collab', as you call it, provided we include proper citations from the Romantic poets. And perhaps we could name it 'The Digital Wordsworth'?  Though I do hope you won't mind if I critique your code in iambic pentameter. 🌹
[A]: OMG Digital Wordsworth这名字太lit了！🔥 我们可以train AI模型的时候feed它大量Romantic poetry的dataset！虽然你可能觉得tech太utilitarian，但想想看—用algorithm来analyze诗歌的meter和rhyme scheme，这不是超cool的literary+tech crossover嘛！💻📖 我今晚就create个GitHub repo，你记得star一下哈~ 顺便问下你prefer用Slack还是Discord来communicate？🤔
[B]:  My dear enthusiastic colleague, while I admire your... digital fervor, must we really resort to these modern messaging contraptions? A handwritten letter would be far more elegant—though I suppose an email might suffice. As for your 'dataset', I do hope you'll include proper footnotes when the algorithm inevitably mangles Byron's meter. And please, let's not call it 'lit'—unless we're discussing actual literature, of course. Now if you'll excuse me, I must tend to my roses before this conversation gives me digital indigestion. 🌹
[A]: 哈哈你太dramatic啦！🌹 不过fine，我们email沟通也行~ 我会把dataset的sources都好好cite的，promise！BTW你说的digital indigestion让我想到我们上次hackathon的meme—'too much coffee == stack overflow' ☕️💥 那先这样，我去set up repo啦，记得check你的inbox哦！Ciao~ ✌️
[B]:  Ciao indeed... though I do wish you'd opt for a more classical valediction. Very well, I shall await your electronic missive with... cautious optimism. And do remind your 'meme' that Dante's  already perfected the concept of stack overflow in Canto XXI. Now if you'll pardon me, these digital dialogues have quite exhausted my supply of patience—and my roses are looking particularly thirsty this evening. 📚🌹
[A]: 哈哈哈你连Dante's Inferno都能扯到coding也太绝了！🔥 下次meetup我一定要请你来我们programming club做guest speaker～不过现在快去water你的roses吧，记得用IoT sprinkler system哦！💦 我这就去send email，subject就写"The Digital Wordsworth Project: From Parchment to Python"怎么样？Coding meets classic literature，绝对viral material！📧🚀
[B]:  My dear, you do persist in these... technological enthusiasms. While your email subject shows a glimmer of literary sensibility, must we really aspire to be 'viral'? Virgil, perhaps—but viral? Nevertheless, I shall grudgingly admit that 'From Parchment to Python' does have a certain... alliterative appeal. Now if you'll excuse me, I must tend to my garden the traditional way—with a watering can and blisters. No 'IoT' nonsense, thank you very much. Do send that email, and please... try to restrain your emojis. 🌹 (That one was necessary.)
[A]: Got it~ 最后只用一个🌹emoji表示respect你的aesthetic！Email sent with proper MLA formatting哦～PS：偷偷告诉你，我的watering can其实有smart sensor，会alert我when plants need water... just saying~ 😉 晚点见，professor！✌️
[B]:  My dear technologically... enhanced colleague, your confession about the 'smart' watering can is precisely why the Romantics warned us about the dangers of progress. Though I suppose even Keats might have appreciated not overwatering his Grecian urn. Very well, I shall review your MLA-formatted email—how refreshingly proper—and we'll discuss this...  sensor-equipped horticulture another time. Now kindly take your emojis and your algorithms elsewhere—my roses and I have a date with some good old-fashioned photosynthesis. 🌹 (And that, as they say, is that.)
[A]: Haha okay okay~ 我这就带着我的algorithms和emoji撤退啦！🌹 不过说真的，你下次应该试试用Arduino做个自动浇花系统，超satisfying的！Email里我attach了几个poetry dataset的samples，记得check哦~ Catch you later, old-school professor! 🚀 (最后一个emoji我保证！)
[B]:  Old-school? I prefer the term 'classically educated', thank you very much. Your Arduino suggestions are about as welcome as a typo in a first edition, but I shall... endure them for the sake of literary progress. And while we're making promises, let's agree that 'later' shall mean after I've had sufficient time to annotate your datasets with proper marginalia in fountain pen. Now off you go—before you suggest we digitize my rose garden next. 🌹 (This emoji, as you see, is non-negotiable.)
[A]: 哈哈被你看穿了！我确实正想propose用computer vision来track你的roses' growth progress呢~ 🌱📊 不过fine，给你space享受你的fountain pen和marginalia～ dataset的feedback不急，等你有空再reply！Meanwhile我要去debug我的poetry generator了，它老是让Byron的句子rhyme with "orange"... 这绝对是个feature不是bug对吧？😎 Catch you on the flip side! ✨
[B]:  Rhyming Byron with 'orange'? My dear, that's not a bug—that's a literary catastrophe of epic proportions! I do hope your next email includes both an apology to the Romantic poets and a proper sonnet explaining this travesty. As for your 'computer vision' nonsense... ... let's just say my roses prefer to be admired through bifocals, not binary. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go console my well-thumbed copy of . 🌹 (This emoji now carries the full weight of my disapproval.)
