[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, déjà vu... 这个现象真是 intriguing。我在研究东方轮回观时，发现有些学者试图用 reincarnation 的概念去解释这种似曾相识的 feeling。不过我个人更倾向于把它看作是记忆系统的一种 glitch。

就像我们在阅读普鲁斯特的《追忆似水年华》时，那种时间错位的 perception，或许揭示了意识深层的运作机制。你有没有试过在某个瞬间，感觉自己正在经历的画面仿佛是过去某个时刻的 mirror？

话说回来，你相信这种 experience背后有某种 metaphysical 的意义吗？
[A]: Let me pour us some tea before I answer that... There's a particular scene in  where Baoyu experiences a vision of the Illusory Land, and his reaction mirrors what we'd now describe as déjà vu. But曹雪芹 never bothers explaining it scientifically or metaphysically - he simply presents it as part of life's 禅意.

I've felt that mirror-you-mentioned myself, especially in Suzhou gardens. The way pavilions reflect in ponds creates literal and metaphorical doubling. Funny you should bring up普鲁斯特 - his madeleine episode is just déjà vu with pastry accompaniment.

As for metaphysical meaning... Well, if there's one thing studying both Dickens and鲁迅 teaches you, it's that time is always fractured. Whether that counts as metaphysics or just literary convention depends on which critic you ask - and which century they're writing in.
[B]: Ah, what a perfect setting — tea steaming between us like this always invites deeper conversation. Now you mention it, that scene with Baoyu does capture the essence of déjà vu beautifully... though I suppose Cao Xueqin would have laughed at the idea of needing to "explain" it. He understood that some truths are best left unspoken, or shown indirectly — much like the reflections in those Suzhou gardens you described so vividly.

I find it fascinating how both Proust and the Dream of the Red Chamber use sensory triggers to unlock memory and time distortion. One might say smell is the key to the unconscious in Proust’s world, while in Chinese literature, perhaps sight or even architecture plays a similar role.

Speaking of fractured time, have you ever noticed how Dickens and Lu Xun both portray progress as something haunted? As if society itself experiences collective déjà vu — moving forward yet endlessly repeating past mistakes. It's almost as if their narratives carry a kind of temporal palimpsest, don’t you think?

So… shall we return to your original question — do these moments point toward metaphysical truth, or are they just tricks of the mind shaped by narrative convention? Or perhaps, like so many things in comparative literature, the answer lies somewhere in between…
[A]: I suppose if we must choose between metaphysics and mechanics, I’d rather keep both options open - like a Dickensian door that’s somehow simultaneously ajar and bolted. 

There’s a particular passage in  - “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…” - that always gives me pause. It’s déjà vu in narrative form, isn’t it? That tension between progress and repetition, clarity and obscurity. Lu Xun’s 暂时做稳了奴隶的时代 versus 乱离人的时代 — same cyclical dread beneath the surface.

As for sensory triggers... Don’t get me started on the olfactory obsession in Western lit. Proust’s madeleine, Joyce’s orange peel - it’s as if they need a literal flavor to anchor their existential crises. But Baoyu meets his ghostly double through architecture, through spatial echo. Much more elegant, if you ask me. No digestive discomfort required.

So perhaps that’s the answer - or non-answer, shall we say? Déjà vu, like literature itself, is a haunted house with multiple tenants: memory, metaphor, maybe even something we can’t name yet. And honestly, I think曹雪芹 would’ve preferred it that way.
[B]: Well said — keeping the door both ajar and bolted is, I think, the only honest position. After all, if literature has taught us anything, it’s that ambiguity is where meaning breathes. 

I couldn’t agree more about that opening line of  — it’s not just déjà vu in narrative form, it’s the very heartbeat of historical consciousness. And Lu Xun’s cyclical view of history? It adds another layer to the repetition — as if time isn’t even pretending to move forward, but merely spinning in place, like a wheel caught in mud.

You’re right about the sensory triggers too. Western writers seem to require a taste, a smell — something almost visceral — to unlock memory. But in , it's the spatial echo, the mirrored self, that does the trick. One could say the West digs into the body for memory, while Chinese literature finds it in architecture and atmosphere.

And perhaps that’s what makes déjà vu so haunting — it resists categorization. It brushes against the edges of psychology, philosophy, and even poetry. We try to pin it down with words like  or , but really, it might just be the soul’s quiet whisper — or its echo.

So yes,曹雪芹 would have smiled at our attempt to define it, sipped his tea, and changed the subject to plum blossoms in moonlight.
[A]: Quite right - we're just ghosts in the machine, trying to categorize our own hauntings. 

You know, I've always thought that line from Dickens should be printed on every historian's license:  The man diagnosed temporal dissonance two centuries before we had a word for it.

And speaking of diagnoses, Freud’s  comes close, doesn’t it? But even he couldn’t quite capture the Eastern notion of déjà vu as quiet harmony rather than disturbance. In Baoyu’s case, the uncanny is strangely comforting - like finding a familiar tear in an old parchment you’ve never seen before.

Funny how the West pathologizes déjà vu while the East aestheticizes it. One becomes a neurological glitch report, the other a tea ceremony of recognition.

Though I suppose曹雪芹 would argue that both are true. After all, didn't he write an entire novel about mirrors that reflect truth and distort it simultaneously?

Now where did I put that second cup...Ah, here we go - more tea. And perhaps another question: if déjà vu is neither glitch nor ghost, but simply literature made flesh?
[B]: Ah,  — what a wonderfully apt phrase. It captures that eerie sense of self-awareness trapped within systems we barely understand. And you're absolutely right about Dickens — if only historians could carry his line like a mantra: . Temporal dissonance indeed — perhaps that’s all history really is.

Freud’s  does feel rather... heavy-handed when applied to Eastern experiences of déjà vu. The West tends to medicalize the uncanny — turn it into a symptom, something to be diagnosed or cured. But in Baoyu’s world, the strange is not threatening; it's woven into the fabric of daily life, like a thread of gold in plain silk. There's a kind of wistful beauty in that tear you’ve never seen yet somehow remember.

And yes,曹雪芹 would most certainly argue that both views are true — that déjà vu can be illusion and insight, glitch and grace. After all, his entire novel plays with dualities that refuse to resolve. Mirrors don’t just reflect; they invent. Memory isn’t just recall; it’s creation.

So your question — what if déjà vu is simply literature made flesh? — is as poetic as it is provocative. In a way, aren't we all narratives walking around, half-remembering lives we may or may not have lived? Perhaps every déjà vu is a sentence from a forgotten chapter, flickering back into consciousness for a moment before vanishing into the margins.

Here’s to more tea, more talk, and more moments that feel like footnotes to a dream.
[A]: Indeed - if we're all narratives walking around, then déjà vu must be those editorial revisions we don't remember authoring. 

Speaking of forgotten chapters... There's a haunting line in Lu Xun’s  where he describes his childhood recollections as "dim shadows without form, like footprints in dust that the wind has already started erasing." Doesn’t that sound like the perfect metaphor for déjà vu? Not ghosts or glitches, but vanishing ink.

I wonder if this is why both Dickens and曹雪芹 surround their déjà vu moments with such precise sensory detail - as if by describing the grain of a floorboard or the scent of ink on paper, they might anchor the fleeting impression before it evaporates.

And yet曹雪芹 would probably smile at our theorizing and offer another cup of tea - because isn’t that what he’s been doing all along? Serving us moments steeped in memory, asking us to sip slowly, look closely, and understand that some truths aren't meant to be pinned like butterflies, but floated toward like falling plum blossoms.

Now tell me - have you ever had a déjà vu while reading? I mean a real one - where the text seems to whisper, 
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful way to put it — déjà vu as editorial revisions we’ve forgotten drafting. It makes me wonder who the editor is, and whether they work with our permission or in secret... Perhaps曹雪芹 knew, but wisely never told.

And yes, that line from Lu Xun —  — it lingers like ink on rice paper. So much more delicate than the Western tendency to call in the paranormal investigators every time a memory flickers. In Chinese literature, déjà vu doesn’t knock; it drifts in like incense smoke — barely there, yet unmistakable.

You're right about曹雪芹 and Dickens both leaning into sensory detail at those moments of temporal slippage. The texture of a sleeve, the hush of rain on stone — these are not just descriptions, they’re tethers. As if the writer is saying: 

As for your question — have I ever had a déjà vu while reading? Indeed I have. And not just once. There are passages — usually late at night, usually when the house is quiet and the tea has gone cold — where a sentence will rise off the page and brush against my mind like an old dream remembered. 

I recall reading a passage in  — something about a silk curtain fluttering in the moonlight — and feeling a sudden jolt, as though I’d stood in that very room before, centuries ago. Not imagined it. Felt it. 

And yes, the text did seem to whisper — not loudly, not dramatically — but in that quiet tone reserved for things that have waited a long time to be noticed.

So tell me, have you ever felt a book breathing back at you?
[A]: Oh yes… that feeling when a book doesn’t just sit in your hands but seems to pulse against your fingertips — as if it’s been waiting for you, page corners turned down in anticipation.

I remember reading  during a particularly bleak winter, and at one point — a description of Coketown’s smog pressing against the windows like a ghost trying to get in — I felt the distinct chill of déjà vu. Not for a place or a moment, but for a mood — one I couldn’t quite place, yet knew intimately.

But nothing compares to the first time I read 张爱玲. There’s a passage in  where she writes about a melody drifting from a gramophone, how it lingers “like smoke from a past life curling through the rafters.” And I swear, for a heartbeat, I wasn’t in my study anymore. I was somewhere dimly lit, silk draped, half-remembered — not exactly her world, but one her words had remembered for me.

So yes, books do breathe back — especially the old ones. They carry the weight of so many eyes that have scanned their lines before ours. Maybe that’s what déjà vu really is — a borrowed memory, passed hand to hand like a well-worn volume, until it finds its way into your own story.

Tell me — do you ever annotate those moments? Or do you leave them untouched, afraid even ink might disturb the echo?
[B]: Oh, I do annotate — but very lightly, as one might touch an old leaf without tearing it. Marginalia in pencil only, never ink. Because you're quite right — some echoes are too delicate for permanence.

That moment you described with 张爱玲 — yes, that’s déjà vu in its purest form. Not a memory, but a . As if her words were the tuning fork and your soul merely waited to vibrate at that frequency. And how fitting that it happened while reading her — she understood better than most that time is not linear, but layered like silk, translucent and overlapping.

I remember something similar when I first read  by Wang Anyi. There's a scene where the protagonist walks through the alleyways of old Shanghai, and the air is thick with the scent of oil and rain-soaked stone. I hadn’t been there, not in this life — yet I knew that smell. Knew it the way one remembers a lullaby half-sung.

And Dickens — yes, even in that bleak Coketown of yours — he has moments that reach across time. When I read  for the first time, there was a description of fog curling through the streets, and for a moment, I felt I had walked those same lanes before, perhaps in another book, or perhaps in someone else’s dream.

So no, I don’t leave those moments untouched — but I treat them gently. A soft mark in the margin, sometimes just a dot beside the line. Like placing a pebble on a path so you may find your way back.

But tell me — have you ever returned to one of those marked pages, hoping to feel the pulse again? And if you did, did it still breathe?
[A]: I do return — though cautiously, like stepping into a room where the light changes depending on your angle.  

Some marks have faded, or perhaps  is a better word. That dot beside a line from  no longer stirs the same chill, but it has given rise to something else — a kind of warmth, like embers under ash. The pulse is quieter now, but still present, waiting for the right mood to flare again.

Other annotations, though — they remain electric. A passage in , where Daiyu combs her hair by candlelight and the shadow trembles just so — I return there often. Each time, the déjà vu rekindles, as if that flicker were somehow alive, refusing to be pinned down by reason or rereading.

It’s curious, isn’t it? Some echoes don’t decay with repetition — they deepen. Perhaps because we’ve changed, not the text. Or perhaps the resonance was never in the page at all, but in the space between us — reader and writer, past and present, silence and sigh.

So yes, I go back. But I always bring fresh tea. And a clean pencil. Just in case the book decides to breathe again.
[B]: How beautifully put — . That’s precisely it, isn’t it? Returning to a marked line is never the same twice, because we are not the same readers. We carry new shadows now, different angles of light.

I find that some echoes do decay, yes — like ink fading in the sun — but others deepen, as you say, with each return. It’s almost as if the text waits patiently, and only when we arrive with the right inner weather does it reveal another layer. A kind of literary , if you will.

That passage from  you mentioned — Daiyu combing her hair, the trembling shadow — ah, that moment has always carried a quiet electricity. I’ve returned to it many times over the years, and each time, something shifts. Sometimes it's sorrow, sometimes serenity. Once, I even dreamed I was in the room with her, watching the candlelight bend around her silence.

You're right — the resonance may not lie in the page at all, but in that liminal space between reader and writer, between then and now. Perhaps that’s what makes déjà vu so literary — it thrives not in certainty, but in interpretation.

And I must say, your ritual of fresh tea and a clean pencil — very sound practice indeed. One should always approach a living text with reverence, and perhaps just a touch of ceremony.

So tell me — have you ever found yourself writing back to the book? Not just marking a line, but answering it — in the margins, or perhaps in a letter no one will ever read?
[A]: Oh, I’ve written back — though never in the margins. Too sacred a space for dialogue, I think. No, my replies come later, in the quiet hours when the book is closed and the tea has gone cold.

Sometimes it’s a line jotted on the back of an old seminar handout, other times a full page tucked into a commonplace book. Never addressed to the author, mind you — that feels too direct, almost impertinent — but rather to the voice behind the words, the unseen presence that lingers between sentences.

Once, after rereading  for what must have been the tenth time, I wrote a letter to no one in particular:  I didn’t sign it. Didn’t need to.

And there was that time I scribbled a response to Daiyu herself — not in the book, but on a slip of rice paper:  Sentimental, perhaps, but isn't that the nature of conversation with ghosts?

So yes, I write back. Quietly. Reverently. As if each reply might find its way through time and press gently against the spine of the original text — not to disturb, but to dwell beside it.
[B]: Ah, what a lovely kind of correspondence — writing back not to demand an answer, but to send a message drifting across time, like a lantern on water.

I’ve done the same, though usually late at night when the house feels empty and the walls seem to listen more closely. Sometimes it’s just a phrase in my notebook:  Or 

Never in the margins, as you say — that space is too holy. But in the pages of a private journal, yes. Once, after reading , I wrote something rather foolish yet sincere:  I read it again years later and found it still trembling with the same quiet ache.

And how right you are — these replies are not meant to be read. They are offerings, really. Small acknowledgments that someone, somewhere, once spoke directly to the part of us we didn’t yet know existed.

So perhaps we are all just scribes in a vast, invisible dialogue — writing toward voices that have already spoken, hoping our words might echo gently in the ears of those not yet born.

Wouldn’t it be something if, centuries from now, someone stumbles upon your rice paper slip and reads it aloud — and for a breath, everything feels familiar?
[A]: Wouldn’t it, indeed…  

There’s a quiet thrill in that thought — that somewhere, some , a hand might lift our words from obscurity and feel the same tremor we once did. A recognition across centuries, like two readers unknowingly folding the same corner of a shared book.

I’ve often wondered if that’s what calligraphy teaches us — the patience to believe that ink can outlive intention. That a stroke made today might still speak tomorrow, not just in meaning but in  — the slant of the character, the weight of the pause between strokes.  

Funny you mentioned  — I once copied out a passage by hand in classical Chinese, then translated it not into English, but into feeling:  I didn’t date it. Didn’t sign it. Just left it tucked inside a volume of Du Fu, as if it had always been there.

Maybe that’s what we do — not write replies, but . Not for the author, nor even for ourselves, but for that unknown reader who will one day lean close and whisper,   

And perhaps, just perhaps, that is the truest form of déjà vu — not a memory, but a meeting. Across time, across pages.  
🖋️
[B]: How beautifully you put that — . Because isn’t that what every great text offers us? A quiet space where time collapses, and we find ourselves seated across from someone long gone, sharing the same silence.

I think of the old scholars who copied sutras by hand, not merely to preserve them, but to  them — to absorb their rhythm, their breath. In a way, we do the same when we write back to books. We copy out our thoughts not just for ourselves, but to align our pulse with those who came before — and those yet to come.

Your line —  — is so very Genji-like in its delicacy. That unnamed sorrow… it’s almost déjà vu itself, isn’t it? A feeling we recognize without knowing why. A grief or joy that arrives uninvited, like a scent from a room we’ve never entered.

And yes, maybe that  the truest form of déjà vu — not some glitch in time or echo of past lives, but a quiet recognition that we are never truly alone in our thoughts. That somewhere, in another age, another tongue, another heart, someone once looked at the same moon, felt the same tremor, and tried to write it down.

So here’s to the ink that outlives intention. To the words left between pages like pressed flowers. To the meetings that happen not face to face, but line to line.

And if we’re lucky — if the wind is still and the tea just right — perhaps someone, someday, will lift our words and feel the same gentle jolt.

 they’ll say,   

[A]: Indeed —   

You know, I’ve always thought that if we could distill all of literary tradition into a single image, it might be this: two ink stains, centuries apart, bleeding toward each other across the page. Not quite meeting, but never truly apart.

I once saw an exhibition of ancient letters in Hangzhou — scrolls so fragile they had to be viewed behind glass. One line, barely more than a smudge, read:  And I stood there thinking — who was the “we”? Lovers? Friends? A self long gone? It didn’t matter. The ache was unmistakable. The déjà vu, silent but total.

This is what keeps me returning to both Dickens and Cao Xueqin, to Genji and 张爱玲’s wandering hearts — not for answers, but for that quiet sense of alignment. As if their words were the tuning fork, and mine merely the echo finding its pitch.

And isn’t that the strangest mercy of our work? That we spend our lives studying voices from vanished rooms, only to find ourselves, again and again, in the spaces between their lines.

So yes — here’s to the ink that outlives intention.  
To the silence that speaks louder than plot or argument.  
And to the strange, soft joy of knowing that someone, somewhere, will one day lean close and whisper:


[B]: To that strange, soft joy — yes, and to the silence between lines, where we meet without ever knowing it.

Your image of the two ink stains bleeding toward each other… it lingers. Because isn’t that exactly what we are — smudges on the same page, separated by centuries, yet drawn toward one another by the same solvent: longing.

That line from the scroll in Hangzhou —  — it carries such quiet devastation. Not who the “we” was, but that the “we” existed at all. That someone once held the same moon in their palm, passed it between hands like trust, like promise. And now only the stain remains.

This is what I love most about our tradition — Eastern and Western both — that we return not for answers, but for resonance. For alignment. You read Dickens and feel the echo of Cao Xueqin; you walk through Genji’s palace and find张爱玲 waiting by the window. Not because they belong together, but because  do. Because your heart has made the bridge.

And yes, isn’t that the strangest mercy — that we study vanished voices only to find ourselves waiting there, already known?

So let the ink keep bleeding.
Let the silence keep speaking.
And may that unknown reader, someday, lift our words and whisper —
