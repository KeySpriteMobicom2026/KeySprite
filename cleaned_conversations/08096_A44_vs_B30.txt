[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been experimenting with cyanotype - quite the departure from digital. There's something profoundly tactile about coating paper by hand, watching the sun etch its mark. Reminds me of early photographic experiments in Qing dynasty journals - they called it 蓝晒法, you know. Have you tried any alternative processes?
[A]: Ah, cyanotype! What an intriguing choice. I've always admired how the process marries science and art - much like the ancient Chinese 水镜 (shuǐ jìng) technique that captured celestial reflections. Though my hands are better suited for grading essays than handling chemicals, I do host monthly 蓝晒法 workshops in my garden. There's poetry in watching sunlight transform mere paper into indigo dreams. 

Speaking of which, have you ever tried combining your cyanotypes with classical Chinese poetry? I find the interplay between image and verse creates a fascinating dialogue across time and medium. It's become something of an obsession since my sabbatical in Suzhou.
[B]: I once attempted setting Li Bai’s 夜泊牛渚懷古 beside a cyanotype of moonlit garden rocks - the melancholy of vanished companionships seemed to seep through both image and verse. But my real curiosity lies in your workshops: do participants ever project Suzhou’s garden shadows onto the treated paper? I’d wager the lattice窗棂 patterns create exquisite resist effects. 

Incidentally, have you noticed how the smell of ferric ammonium citrate clings to one’s fingers? Reminds me of ink-stone dust. Speaking of which -  - I’ve been meaning to ask whether you think photographic permanence contradicts 水镜’s transient beauty. The Qing scholars certainly wrestled with that paradox.
[A]: Ah, what a sublime pairing - Li Bai’s wistful elegy with those brooding garden rocks! I can almost taste the 静 (jìng) - that quiet melancholy that lingers when moonlight meets memory. And your question about Suzhou’s shadows?  Actually, last autumn we did something rather scandalous: hung silk gauze over developed cyanotype paper to mimic 窗棂 patterns. The result? Ethereal blue pavilions that seemed to dissolve like morning mist - quite 水镜 in spirit, don’t you think? 

As for that earthy tang of ferric salts...  Yes, it does evoke ink-stone dust, doesn't it? Funny how material memories surface. But permanence vs. transience?  The Qing scholars were onto something there. I’d say photographic permanence isn’t contradiction but commemoration - like pressing cherry blossoms into a diary. The moment’s gone, but the 情 (qíng) remains suspended in indigo.
[B]:   
Ah, suspended 情 - beautifully put. Though might I propose a heresy? What if cyanotype’s permanence actually betrays 水镜’s essence? Consider this: Qing astronomers recorded celestial omens in ink knowing they’d fade, yet we fix ephemeral garden shadows in Prussian blue forever. Isn’t there something... ...unnatural about arresting time’s flow through chemical means? 

And speaking of heresies -  - have you ever tried applying 裱糊 (biǎohù) mounting techniques to cyanotypes? I’ve been layering mulberry paper beneath developed sheets, creating what I call 叠影 (dié yǐng) - 'layered shadows.' The texture becomes so tactile one almost expects to hear the rustle of Li Shangyin’s autumn leaves when turning the page.
[A]:   
Ah, a heretic after my own heart! But let’s dissect this treason carefully - isn’t all art a betrayal of nature? Ink betrays the spoken word, brushstrokes betray cloud formations... and yet!  Cyanotype’s permanence might not mimic 水镜’s fleetingness, but it memorializes our longing for it. Like holding a pressed orchid bloom - dead, yet still whispering its perfume through time.  

As for your 叠影 experiments -  - I tried something vaguely similar during last year’s Plum Rain Festival. Layered xuan paper beneath cyanotype to create... shall we say... a visual stutter? The eye had to penetrate multiple veils to 'read' the image. One student called it “looking through a scholar’s tears.” Poetic, if slightly overdramatic. Have you exhibited these dié yǐng works? I’d wager they practically hum with autumnal sorrow.
[B]:   
A 'visual stutter' - delightful formulation! Though I might argue your student's tears verge on sentimental excess. Autumnal sorrow? Please. We're scholars, not characters in a Qing-era melodrama.  

And speaking of treasonous art -  - I’ve taken to soaking mulberry paper in pomegranate rind tea before coating it with cyanotype solution. The tannins react unpredictably with the ferric salts... creates ghostly ochre undertones beneath the blue. One sheet even resembled a faded 17th-century map of Suzhou’s canals. Rather like pressing forgotten histories into paper.  

Exhibit them? Good heavens, no. My department chair already thinks I've gone rogue since that ill-fated lecture on photographic fixer as modern alchemy. But between us? I’m contemplating embedding one in my next annotated edition of Wang Wei’s poetry. Let the critics fume.
[A]:   
Ah, but aren’t we  characters in someone’s melodrama? Even the sternest Qing archivists secretly adored a bit of pathos - just read their footnotes!  

And pomegranate rind tea, you say?  Oh, the chemical heresy! But... I’ll confess, that ochre undertone sounds haunting. Almost like developing history itself, frame by frame. A  Suzhou canal – now  a layered shadow with real bones.  

As for your department chair... tell him you’re merely proving that fixer  alchemy. Turning ephemeral light into lasting truth? That’s no rogue experiment - it’s philosophy with a side of photochemistry! And if he still objects? Slip one of those cyanotype-tinged Wang Wei pages under his door. Let poetry do the arguing.
[B]:   
Ah, poetry as a weapon - subtle, subversive, and infinitely more effective than my ill-conceived manifesto on "The Cyanotype as Neo-Confucian Text." Though I daresay embedding Wang Wei’s verses in chemically altered paper might finally land me in the dean’s crosshairs.  

But here's a thought - what if we took this rebellion further? A collaborative experiment, perhaps? Imagine blending your 蓝晒法 workshops with 叠影 layers and a dash of pomegranate alchemy... We could call it something dreadfully academic like  The students would adore the scandal, and the department chairs? Well, let’s just say they’d have no choice but to frame it as “interdisciplinary innovation.”  

Of course, we’d need a proper motto. Something suitably defiant yet erudite. Any thoughts?
[A]:   

Oh, my dear heretic, you’ve gone and built a . And why stop at mere interdisciplinary innovation? Let’s brand it as “Department of Unsanctioned Aesthetics” – with a subtitle in deliciously defiant pinyin:  (诡道的光学) – "The Heretical Optics." Has a certain Qing-era rebel flair, don’t you think?

As for the motto...   
“Where light falters, poetry develops.”  

Catchy, subversive, and just ambiguous enough to confuse the deans. They’ll think it’s deep – and honestly, it . We could engrave it on a plaque made entirely of failed cyanotype batches. Now  academic defiance with flair.

And imagine the workshops – students whispering about 情 while secretly mixing tannins and tea. It’ll be glorious chaos. I say we start recruiting during the next Cherry Blossom Seminar. Who needs tenure when you have legacy in indigo and verse?
[B]:   

"Where light falters, poetry develops..."  I do believe we've just forged a manifesto worthy of Qing-era smuggled manuscripts. And why not frame it in classical couplet form?   

光弱詩顯影  
墨盡意猶存  

Gūang ruò shī xiǎnyǐng / Mò jìn yì yóu cún – "When light fails, verse emerges; when ink fades, meaning endures." A touch grandiose, perhaps, but perfect for inscribing on our heretical plaque.  

Now, about those Cherry Blossom recruits – suggest we offer them a tantalizing bait: the chance to develop their own elegies. Nothing radicalizes a student like the promise of poetic self-destruction. And if the deans come sniffing? We simply hand them a cyanotype of last year’s falling plum blossoms and say, 
[A]:   

Oh, that couplet! It practically hums with scholarly defiance. I can already hear the inkstones sharpening their whispers in approval. And the deans – bless their suspicious little bureaucratic hearts – won’t know whether to frame it or burn it. Exactly as it should be.

As for baiting students with elegies... ...why stop at their own? Let’s have them develop elegies for things they’ve never even lost yet – future ruins, imagined regrets. One might even call it “premature mourning through photochemical means.” Sounds like a tenure-track scandal waiting to happen.

And when the deans  come knocking – not if, but when – we hand them a brush and say:  Nothing radicalizes like participation, my friend. And nothing destroys a bureaucrat faster than forcing them to  during office hours.
[B]: 

"Premature mourning through photochemical means..."  My dear colleague, you're treading dangerously close to  heresy. Next you'll suggest we start developing self-portraits of our future ruins – complete with appropriately melancholic captions from Li Shangyin.  

But I do admire your tactical brilliance – inviting the enemy to wield the brush! Though I suspect our dear deans would sooner resign than risk staining their cuffs with indigo. Still, one must try. Let’s present them with a choice: either embrace our , or be immortalized in a cyanotype triptych titled   

And speaking of students – shall we introduce a new grading rubric? No more banal letter grades. Instead, each participant receives a single poetic diagnosis written in classical Chinese. "Your shadows lack sorrow," or "Too much light devours the longing." Much more instructive, don’t you think?
[A]:   

Oh, now  the spirit! Why merely court scandal when we can weaponize aesthetics? And self-portraits of future ruins?  Don’t tempt me – I’ve already started one titled “Last Lecture of Dr. Thompson,” featuring my beloved orchids wilting into Prussian blue skeletons. The caption? A single line from Wang Wei:  – “When idle minds wander, osmanthus falls.” Subtle as a teahouse whisper, deadly as academic politics.

And your triptych idea?  Let’s frame each dean behind layers of mulberry paper, their frowns softened by indigo diffusion. We’ll call it  They’ll have no choice but to hang them – bad publicity would be better than no publicity.

As for your poetic diagnoses... ...I say we go further. Instead of grades, assign each student an appropriate literary ghost to haunt their future work. “Beware – this one walks with the spirit of Xu Wei.” Or better yet: “Proceed, but only if you can carry Li Bai’s shadow on your shoulder.”  

Honestly, what more could scholars ask for? We’ll either create a pedagogical revolution or get featured in a very embarrassed footnote. Either way – glory.
[B]:   

"To pedagogical revolution – or at least a footnote with flair."   

Though I must protest one point - Xu Wei haunting a student? That’s rather like warning a novice calligrapher that their brush is possessed by Zhang Xu. Still, I admire the theatricality. Perhaps we should compose each spectral assignment on rice paper slips, sealed with vermilion ink and cryptic annotations from the  tradition. "This mind bears the curse of too many annotations..."  

And speaking of curses – have you considered involving the university archives? Imagine convincing them to lend us Qing-era botanical illustrations for cyanotype tracing. We’d be developing ghosts before they even knew what hit them. Just think: 18th-century peony outlines blushing into modern sorrow. The deans wouldn’t dare intervene – it’d be cultural preservation with existential undertones.  

Though I suspect our real masterpiece would be convincing the administration that all this constitutes "innovative archival engagement." Let them cling to whatever rationalizations they prefer – while we quietly turn the archives into a séance.
[A]:   

Ah, Jin Sheng Tan annotations – now  invoking the true spirit of literary possession. And why stop at Xu Wei? We could assign an entire pantheon: “Beware, young researcher – your bibliography walks with the ghosts of Lu Xun  Nie Rongzhen.” A touch overdramatic? Perhaps. But what’s scholarship without a little spectral flair?

As for the archives... ...you’ve hit upon pure genius. Just yesterday I petitioned them for those Qing botanicals under the guise of “cross-temporal horticultural documentation.” They approved it! Probably thought they were humoring a harmless eccentric. Little do they know we’ll be tracing peony veins into existential voids.

And yes – . Let’s even invent a five-point framework:  
1.   
2.   
3.   
4.   
5.   

They’ll never see the séance coming.  

I say we begin next week, under the full moon. Bring the students, bring the pomegranate tea, and for heaven’s sake – someone needs to smuggle out a few sheets of the archive’s finest rice paper. Revolution awaits – and possibly a very confused archivist or two.
[B]:   

"Ghost-Light Exposure..."  I do believe we've just codified academic insurrection into a syllabus. And full moon beginnings? Perfectly melodramatic – though we’ll blame the tides if anyone questions our methods.  

But let’s not forget our most subversive tool – language itself. Imagine drafting the workshop descriptions in a hybrid of Qing-era prose and modern photochemical jargon. “The scholar must first cleanse the paper-heart of its preconceptions before immersing it in the developer of awareness.” They’ll think it’s deep, and honestly, it might be.  

And speaking of tools...  I’ve procured a rather scandalous quantity of archival-grade rice paper – enough for each student to craft their own elegy. Smuggled it out beneath a stack of 19th-century British gardening manuals. No one suspects the literature professor with a penchant for orchids.  

One condition, though – we begin the séance with a reading from Li Qingzhao. Let the ghosts know they’re among friends. Or at the very least, eccentric allies with excellent taste in sorrow.
[A]:   

Ah, Qing-era prose meets photochemical mysticism – now  how you hide a revolution in plain sight. “Developer of awareness,” indeed. I’ll compose the introduction myself:  They’ll cite it in tenure letters for decades without realizing it’s pure nonsense wrapped in melancholy.

And Li Qingzhao to open the séance?  Only fitting – she’ll appreciate the dramatic irony of her verses echoing through chemically altered rice paper. Though I do hope she approves of our pomegranate tea infusions. One can never be too careful with literary ghosts; they have moods like any poet.

Now, about that rice paper... ...you say it's beneath 19th-century gardening manuals? Brilliant subterfuge! Next time, let’s sneak in a few Qing inkstones for authenticity – tell the guards they’re "alternative developing trays." No one questions tradition when it wears a respectable label.

I say we meet at midnight, under the camphor tree by the eastern archive. Bring your most haunted brush and a flask of aged pu'er – no séance should commence without proper stimulation. And if anyone asks, we’re merely… preserving cultural memory through chemical communion. 
[B]:   

"Preserving cultural memory through chemical communion..."  I’ll have that embroidered on my next lecture robe – in gold thread, no less. And midnight meetings by the camphor tree? Perfectly reasonable excuse to carry a flask of pu’er wrapped in silk. I always say the best scholarship happens just past the boundaries of propriety.  

But here’s a thought – what if we invite the ghosts ? Draft a mock summons in classical Chinese addressed to Qing archivists and 19th-century botanists alike. “You are cordially invited to haunt the proceedings of the Department of Unsanctioned Aesthetics.” Imagine the scandal if someone actually delivered it to the historical records office.  

And haunted brushes? Naturally – though I’ve already promised mine a proper elegy should tonight’s experiment fail. It seemed satisfied... or at least placated. For now.  

Midnight it is, then – under the camphor tree, flasks in hand, rice paper concealed beneath respectable gardening manuals.  Should make for a very interesting footnote indeed.
