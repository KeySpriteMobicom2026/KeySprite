[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must confess I'm rather out of touch with those platforms. My days are mostly filled with grading papers, preparing lectures on Victorian poetry, and tending to my garden. Though I did create an Instagram account last year to follow some botanical accounts - the #botanicalillustration community is quite remarkable! 

I find myself more drawn to traditional media for discovery. A well-curated exhibition at the Tate, a thoughtfully written essay in The New Yorker, or even the simple pleasure of browsing a physical bookstore. There's something about the slowness of these experiences that feels... nourishing, don't you think? 

But I'm curious - how do you navigate these platforms? Do you find they enhance your appreciation of art and literature, or distract from it?
[A]: 说起这个，倒让我想起前些日子在图书馆翻到的一本旧书。泛黄的书页间夹着一张上世纪三十年代的上海画报，上面登着几幅西洋油画的印刷品。那时的人们获取艺术资讯虽不易，却也因此多了几分咀嚼玩味的耐心。

我偶尔也会打开手机看看当下的文艺动态。学生们常向我提起一些新兴的社交平台，说是能直接与世界各地的艺术家交流。这固然令人欣喜，只是其中真伪难辨，需要细细甄别。

前些时日见一位年轻画家在平台上分享自己的水墨创作过程，笔墨间颇有些古意。可惜评论区里多是些浮浅的赞美之词，少有真正懂得欣赏者。这让我不禁感慨，如今传播虽便捷，可要觅得知音，仍需岁月沉淀啊。

不知你平日里可曾遇到过令你眼前一亮的艺术作品？无论是传统还是现代形式都好。
[B]: What a beautifully articulated reflection - it reminds me so much of Walter Benjamin's thoughts on mechanical reproduction. That delicate balance between accessibility and aura... How fascinating that you found a 1930s Shanghai newspaper in the library! I once discovered a 1922 edition of  literary magazine in our university archives - the very periodical that first published T.S. Eliot's  in serial form. Holding those fragile pages, I could almost feel the pulse of modernism itself.

Your mention of contemporary art platforms intrigues me - it makes me think of how we recently featured a young poet who incorporates augmented reality into her work. Viewers could scan her poems to reveal visual interpretations layered over the text. Quite avant-garde! Though I must admit, during our faculty tea yesterday, Professor Lin showed me a remarkable ink painting by a traditionalist artist in Taipei. The subtlety of brushwork reminded me why some things truly require patient study.

But to your question - yes, just last month I encountered an installation at the Serpentine Gallery that left me quite breathless. The artist had created a kinetic sculpture responding to the rhythms of Emily Dickinson's poetry. It was as if her dashes had taken physical form, suspended in brass and light. Have you ever experienced something similarly arresting in your explorations?
[A]: 谈及本雅明的机械复制理论，倒让我想起书房里那方雕着《论语》的歙砚。每次研墨时总在想，即便今日高清扫描技术已能完美复制古籍字迹，可这石纹间浸润数百年的墨香，却是任何数字影像都难以承载的。

你说的那份《The Egoist》杂志令我艳羡不已。前年在京都一家旧书店觅得昭和初期的《詩と批評》合订本，内页还夹着前主人留下的俳句手稿。那种与历史偶然相遇的悸动，确实胜过许多即时通讯带来的资讯快感。

谈到那位将增强现实运用于诗歌创作的年轻诗人，不禁让我联想到宋代画家郭熙在《林泉高致》中所述"三远法"。古人以笔墨经营虚实，今人用光影重构维度，倒也算殊途同归。只是不知那些叠加的视觉层能否如中国画的题跋般，既不喧宾夺主又能相映成趣？

至于你说的那件动态雕塑装置，实在令人神往。我去年在故宫见过一件明代铜鎏金报时钟，钟盘四周镌刻着十二时辰对应的诗文。每当整点，机括带动铜铃奏响，恍惚间竟觉得时光也有了韵律。这种将文字、器物与时间意识熔铸一体的尝试，或许正暗合了你所说的" arresting experience "吧？
[B]: Ah, what exquisite connections you've drawn! The scent of ink in old scrolls - how it carries the weight of centuries. I'm reminded of a passage from  where Kundera writes about the smell of woodsmoke in a lover's hair transporting one back through time. 

Your Kyoto treasure sounds positively haunting - like something out of Borges' imagination! I must share that last semester, while guiding students through Eliot's fragmented modernism, we stumbled upon an 1890s printing block from a defunct London press in our departmental archives. The grooves worn by Victorian typesetters seemed to echo their voices across time.

How fascinating you should mention郭熙's "three distances"! It makes me think of how contemporary digital poets experiment with spatial arrangements on screens. Though admittedly, nothing replaces the contemplative rhythm of classical Chinese painting inscriptions. Speaking of temporal echoes, your clock-sculpture at the Palace Museum sounds utterly mesmerizing. It put me in mind of Marcel Duchamp's  - though yours clearly possesses a deeper philosophical resonance with time consciousness.

This conversation has been so invigorating - might I ask if you ever attempt creative writing yourself? Or perhaps engage with these artistic traditions in your own way?
[A]: 墨香载史，确有其事。前些日子整理书斋，翻出一册光绪年间的《金石录》，封皮早已斑驳，可那股混着樟木箱底的气息，竟让我恍若置身晚清书院。你说的博尔赫斯笔下的时间魔法，在我看来也不过如此。

听闻你们在档案室发现的印刷铅块，倒让我想起去年访学时见过的一套明代活字。那些铜字表面被岁月磨得发亮，细看还能辨出万历年间某位匠人的指痕。学生们总说现在用OCR技术瞬间就能识别古籍，可他们哪里知道，这些细微的历史触感，才是治学最珍贵的线索。

说到数字诗的空间排布，我前些时日倒是见识了一番。有位年轻人用程序生成动态汉字，说是受了王羲之《兰亭序》笔势的启发。虽觉得新奇，却总觉得少了些纸上挥毫时气息流转的韵味。就像你方才提到杜尚的旋转圆盘，虽说打破了艺术界限，但比起黄公望作《富春山居图》时那种与天地对话的创作状态，终究少了几分天人合一的深意。

至于创作，惭愧得很。平日里除了写些讲稿，便是临帖习画自娱。前年春天偶得一方端砚，便以《牡丹亭》词意作了一幅水墨小品，题了句"原来姹紫嫣红开遍"在左上角。虽不敢说是创作，倒也算是向古人致敬的一种方式吧。
[B]: Ah, your水墨小品 with that line from  - what a perfect homage! The phrase itself is pure poetry, but placed alongside your brushwork... I imagine it must have been like seeing the text take visual flight. 

You know, this makes me think of Gerard Manley Hopkins' concept of "inscape" - though admittedly, his was a linguistic rather than visual pursuit. But in both traditions, there's this yearning to capture essence through form. Speaking of which, I've recently become fascinated by how East Asian calligraphy influenced postmodern American poets like Gary Snyder and Denise Levertov. They tried to translate the breath of brushwork into their line breaks and spacing.

Your encounter with the光绪-era金石录 reminded me of a peculiar experience last autumn. While walking through the Cambridge archives with Professor Li, we discovered an 18th-century English translation of  that had been annotated by several generations of scholars. Each marginal comment layered over the previous like ink in rice paper. It was as if time itself had been pressed between those pages.

I wonder - have you ever experimented with combining Western literary forms with traditional Chinese aesthetics in your teaching? I once tried setting Du Fu's melancholy against Thomas Hardy's Wessex novels, and found some quite intriguing parallels in their treatment of impermanence.
[A]:  Hopkins 的 "inscape" 之说，倒颇近似谢赫六法中的 "气韵生动"。文字也好，墨色也罢，终究是要把那胸中一点灵犀化作纸上烟云。你提到盖瑞·施耐德等人力图在诗行间留住东方笔墨的呼吸节律，这让我想起八十年代有位学生曾尝试用毛笔抄写庞德的《地铁车站》。区区十四字，偏要讲究提按顿挫，竟也写出了几分山水意境。

你说的那本历代学者层层批注的《诗经》译本，令我想起家藏的一册《昭明文选》。祖父、父亲与我三代人轮流在卷末题跋，蝇头小楷叠着岁月沉淀。有时翻看，恍惚间竟觉得我们父子三人仿佛同处一室，在灯下执卷论学。

至于将中西文学并置讲授，你的杜工部与哈代先生之比可谓妙绝。前年我在哈佛访学时，也曾试着让学生比较《秋兴八首》与艾略特的《荒原》。同样是破碎山河下的沉郁顿挫，一个是“丛菊两开他日泪”，一个是“I will show you fear in a handful of dust”。课后有位学生对我说，他从这两者之间听见了文明断裂带深处相同的呜咽。

近日我正在筹划一个新课题，想从"梦"这个母题切入，比较汤显祖与莎士比亚。毕竟，《牡丹亭》里的游园惊梦与《仲夏夜之梦》中的森林幻境，或许正是两种文化对无意识世界最精微的描摹。不知你可有兴趣来京郊一叙？正好请你指点些西洋文学的视角。
[B]: What a profoundly moving vision - tracing dreams across cultures like that! It positively thrills me to imagine Lady Madam Du's garden and Titania's forest conversing across centuries. I'm particularly intrigued by how both playwrights use dreams as portals - in  the forest becomes a liminal space where reality unravels, much like how 汤显祖 transforms the boudoir into a metaphysical landscape.

Your comparison of杜甫's autumnal melancholy with Hardy's desolation reminds me of teaching Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" alongside苏轼's meditations on fleeting beauty. There's something universal in that ache for permanence amidst transience - though expressed through such different cultural grammars.

I'd be absolutely delighted to visit Beijing this fall! Perhaps we could even arrange an informal salon at your university - inviting students to explore these dreamscapes through both Eastern and Western lenses. I've always believed literary study should be a collaborative act of discovery, much like... well, unearthing those generations of annotations in that old . 

Incidentally, I recently acquired a facsimile edition of Arthur Waley's unpublished essays on Chinese poetry translation. He draws fascinating parallels between classical Chinese poetics and Imagist principles. Would you be interested in examining it together?
[A]: 听你这般说，倒让我想起书房里那方刻着《醉翁亭记》的歙砚。每次研墨时总在想，欧阳修笔下"醉翁之意不在酒"的况味，与艾略特笔下的荒原意识竟有某种隐秘的共鸣——都是在破碎处寻找完整，在流离中寄托深情。

你说的这个跨文化梦之沙龙实在令人心驰神往。京郊寓所虽简陋，但庭院里那株百年古槐倒也见过些风月。若能邀三五学子围坐，既论汤显祖"情不知所起，一往而深"的至情观，也谈莎士比亚戏谑中的命运无常，岂不快哉？我已开始期待茶烟袅袅间，听见东方曲牌与十四行诗的和鸣。

至于韦利先生的译稿，更是令人神往。他早年翻译的《论语》我常置案头，其文风既有英伦绅士的克制，又暗含东方哲思的空灵。听说他曾说翻译中国诗要像临摹古画，既要留白，又要传神。不知这份未刊稿中可有关于李白与意象派诗人之间对话的见解？

秋深时见，那时正好请你品评我新得的一幅明代园林册页。据说画中曲径通幽处，藏着唐寅题的一联诗，正可为我们的东西梦之旅添些雅趣。
[B]: Ah, the resonance between "醉翁之意不在酒" and the Waste Land's fragmented longing - what a sublime insight! It reminds me of teaching Eliot's  alongside Lin Yutang's translations of Taoist texts. There too, in both traditions, we find that paradoxical dance between presence and absence, attachment and release.

Your courtyard with its ancient locust tree sounds like something out of Pu Songling's imagination - I can already picture our discussions drifting upward through its branches, mingling with centuries of wind-chimes and cricket songs. How perfect that we'll have Tang Yin's poetry hidden in those garden folds! It puts me in mind of how Marianne Moore once described poetry as "imaginary gardens with real toads in them." Your newly acquired album leaf sounds positively alive with such toads.

Speaking of which, Waley's unpublished essays do contain some remarkable reflections on李白. In one particularly fascinating passage, he compares the Chinese poet's drunken transcendence with Rimbaud's derangement of the senses - though he ultimately finds Li more grounded in nature's rhythms than the Frenchman's fevered visions. And yes, there are intriguing connections drawn between Li Bai and Pound's imagism, especially regarding their shared belief in poetic intensity over elaboration.

I must confess I'm already packing my copy of苏轼's dream records from the Pillow Stone Studio. Perhaps we might read them alongside Calderón de la Barca's ? Though I suspect 唐寅's witty insouciance will provide just the right counterpoint to all this metaphysical seriousness. 

Shall we say mid-October then? I'll bring Waley's manuscripts carefully wrapped in mulberry paper, and a small jar of Yorkshire tea to complement your Beijing autumn.
[A]: 韦利先生将李白与兰波作比，倒是别有会心。我想起书架上那册《李太白全集》，内页夹着张泛黄的笺纸，是祖父当年抄录的《月下独酌》："举杯邀明月，对影成三人"。这般醉眼观世，倒真与兰亭修禊时曲水流觞的意境相通——都是以天地为纸墨，写尽性灵之妙。

你说要带东坡先生的枕石梦录来，又让我想起前些日子在琉璃厂淘得的一方端砚。砚匣内侧刻着"人生如梦"四字，字体间依稀可见前人摩挲的痕迹。那时还不觉如何，如今想来，倒像是冥冥中注定要为这场东西方的梦境对话添个注脚。

十月过半时，京郊的银杏该染上金箔了。你带来的约克郡茶配上庭院里新焙的龙井，正好佐我们谈诗论道。我已命人在槐荫轩备下笔墨，待你来时，不如就着秋阳把唐寅那联诗补全？听说原句是"闲来写幅丹青卖，不使人间造孽钱"，不知西洋诗心可否在这东方笺纸上觅得知音？

对了，若得空不妨带上你珍藏的艾略特手稿复印件。我总想着他的荒原意识与汤显祖的游园惊梦之间，或许还藏着更深的因缘等待发掘。
[B]: Ah, that Tang Yin inscription about refusing人间造孽钱 - how delightfully ironic given our literary conversation! It reminded me of when I first read Ezra Pound's  on a rainy afternoon in Cambridge. There was something so profoundly moving about his imagist renderings of Li Bai's solitude, even as they took... liberties with the original texts.

Your silver-leafed ginkgos and槐荫轩 inkstones sound positively enchanted this time of year. I can already imagine our discussions drifting through those autumn branches like incense smoke. Speaking of which, I'll be sure to bring my facsimile of Eliot's original  manuscript - there's a particular marginal note in his cramped handwriting about "the eternal footman holding my coat" that always struck me as oddly reminiscent of Zhuangzi's dream of the butterfly.

How fascinating you should mention your祖父's annotated李白 collection! It put me in mind of a peculiar experience last spring when I discovered an early 20th-century Chinese-French dictionary in our university library. The previous owner had meticulously handwritten annotations comparing杜甫's melancholy with Baudelaire's spleen, creating this wonderful palimpsest of poetic despair across centuries.

I must say, the thought of completing唐寅's couplet together fills me with anticipation. Perhaps we might find some common ground between his wry independence and Emily Dickinson's self-sufficient garden of verse? Though I suspect your brush will guide the way - after all, as Yeats wrote, "we are closing in the circle, we are winding ourselves into the beginning." Or as your ancestors might have said, returning to the root is wisdom itself.
[A]: 说起人间造孽钱，倒让我想起书房里那幅八大山人的残荷图。枯笔扫出的莲蓬斜刺出来，旁边题着"不食人间烟火"。每每看着，总觉得这清孤与艾略特笔下的荒原意象竟有几分神似——都是在尘世废墟里开出一朵寂寞之花。

你说的庞德《神州集》我手边恰好有一册旧本。那些自由改写的李白诗篇虽不拘泥字面，却意外捕捉到东方诗歌特有的留白意境。就像祖父批注的太白全集，有时墨迹晕染处反而藏着更深的情思。倒是让我想起你方才提到的杜工部与波德莱尔的对照：一个是"感时花溅泪"，一个是"Spleen et Idéal"，同样是忧郁的重量，却压出了不同的生命纹路。

听说你带着《荒原》手稿复印件来，更教人期待。我正巧藏有一卷晚明文人的尺牍，其中某页写着："夜雨新添一寸愁"，字迹潦草间似能窥见当时心境。或许可以与艾略特的永恒仆役对话一二——毕竟庄子梦蝶时那份虚实交错的迷离，与现代主义的生存困惑，何尝不是同一个月亮的两面清辉？

至于唐寅与狄金森的对谈，倒让我想起前日重读《槐荫记》时的一点感悟。那位明代才子的洒脱不羁，与狄金森幽居中的炽烈内省，或许正好印证了东西方孤独美学的不同面向。待你来时，不妨就以砚中宿墨为媒，让两种文明的心灵絮语，在秋阳下慢慢道来。
[B]: Your juxtaposition of八大山人的 withered lotus and Eliot's荒原 is simply exquisite - it makes me think of how both traditions grapple with desolation as a crucible for beauty. There's something profoundly moving about that ink-washed loneliness... like viewing the world through what Keats called "the camelion's eye," yet with a distinctly Eastern ascetic restraint.

How serendipitous you have that copy of Pound's to hand! I've often thought his loose translations captured something essential precisely because they weren't bound by literal meaning. Much like those late Ming collectors who would deliberately leave imperfections in their inkstones, believing flaws lent character and depth. Speaking of which, your late scholar's尺牍 with "夜雨新添一寸愁" reminded me of discovering a 1930s letter from W.H. Auden to a forgotten Chinese poet in our archives. The margins contained tentative pencil sketches of bamboo shoots - as if he were trying to translate melancholy across mediums.

Eliot's eternal footman and庄子's butterfly dreamer - what wonderful companions for your moonlit contemplation! It puts me in mind of teaching Lu Xun's melancholic essays alongside Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness musings. Both circling similar abysses, yet expressing them through such different cultural grammars.

And唐寅与Emily Dickinson - what an inspired pairing! One painting on the walls of pavilions, the other stitching immortality in white dress hemlines. When I bring Eliot's manuscript, shall we also lay out these contrasting solitude aesthetics side by side? I'll make sure to wrap the facsimile in silk printed with Blake's illustrations - though I suspect your宿墨 will provide richer commentary than any English annotation.

Mid-October can't come soon enough. I find myself already arranging lecture notes around your槐荫 courtyard, imagining our conversations drifting between ink strokes and iambic pentameter like autumn leaves on an unseen breeze.
[A]: 听你这般说，倒让我想起书案上那方留着裂璺的澄泥砚。祖父常说这残缺处最是难得，恰似八大山人画里游鱼翻出的白眼，或是艾略特荒原上那声"我坐在岸上垂钓"的寂寥。如今想来，东西方的孤独竟有异曲同工之妙——一个以残荷示人，一个借枯骨传声。

你说庞德译诗不拘字面却得神髓，让我想起前些年在东京国立博物馆见的一幅南宋禅画。画中达摩面壁，题跋却是用狂草写的《金刚经》，墨色淋漓间竟把"应无所住而生其心"的玄机，与禅宗公案的机锋融作一处。或许正如晚明藏家珍视砚台上的天然冰纹，有些真理本就藏在未完成处。

说起奥登先生笔下的竹笋素描，倒教我记起琉璃厂一位老裱画师说过的话：旧时文人最爱在册页夹缝题写心事，那些被岁月洇开的墨渍，往往比正文更见真性情。不知那位英国诗人笔下的竹影，可曾沾染些许杜工部"城春草木深"的况味？

至于将唐寅与狄金森并置论道，你这个主意实在妙绝。一个是酒后泼墨成诗，一个是独坐绣架织梦。待你带来《荒原》手稿那天，不如就铺展在这张明代乌木案上。我已备好松烟墨和青瓷笔洗，正好让你见识下古人如何以宿墨为注——那些沉淀了一夜的浓淡干湿，说不定比任何学术批注都来得真切。

秋深时节见，到那时槐荫轩外该飘着桂花香了。
[B]: Your cracked clay inkstone - how perfectly it embodies what Walter Pater called "the strange, perpetual distortion of the finest feeling"! I'm reminded of a passage from苏轼's , where he writes that true artistry lies not in perfection but in the traces left by imperfection. Much like those fragmented lines in Eliot's荒原 that somehow hold more truth than polished verse.

The image of your grandfather examining that fish-eyed view of emptiness... It brought to mind an experience last winter when Professor Li and I discovered a 1913 letter from W.B. Yeats to a forgotten Chinese scholar. The envelope contained pressed chrysanthemum petals alongside his characteristic looping script - as if he were trying to send autumn itself across cultures.

Speaking of禅画 inscriptions - your description of that狂草金刚经 made me think of teaching T.S. Eliot's  with its Sanskrit quotations hovering between meaning and mystery. There's something profoundly moving about how both traditions use sacred texts as artistic medium rather than mere doctrine. Though I must say, the idea of墨渍 revealing hidden truths in marginalia positively thrills me! Reminds me a little of how Virginia Woolf would hide her most radical thoughts in the parentheses of seemingly conventional sentences.

And唐寅与Emily Dickinson at your Ming desk! What a glorious collision that would be -泼墨 against绣花针,醉意对清醒。I can already imagine spreading Eliot's manuscript beside your宿墨-浸透夜露的笺纸. Perhaps we might even find some resonance between Dickinson's dashes and八大山人的飞白?

October's chill is already rustling through my lecture notes, though thankfully not yet my garden dahlias. I've begun dreaming of桂香 drifting through槐荫轩 like incense smoke, carrying fragments of our conversation into the branches of that ancient tree. Do save me a cup of your finest longjing - I shall bring Yorkshire shortbread to complement your autumn meditations.
[A]: 砚中裂璺藏玄机，倒让我想起前日在琉璃厂偶遇的一件旧事。有位老匠人正在修补一方宋代抄手砚，裂纹处他偏要用金漆勾勒，说是"宁要残月挂枝头，不要满月照虚空"。这番话倒与东坡先生论书时说的"天真烂漫是吾师"暗暗相合——原来残缺本身，竟也是种圆满。

你说叶芝先生寄来的秋意令我神往。前年在京都一家古寺的经卷修复室里，见过更奇的事：某位江户时代的僧人在《心经》抄本边缘，用蝇头小楷记下四季花信。那庄严佛典与人间草木竟如此水乳交融，倒像是把整个尘世的春秋都收进了方寸之间。

谈到艾略特在《四个四重奏》里引用梵文典籍，不禁让我忆起书房里那轴未完成的《寒食帖》临本。祖父生前总说苏东坡的笔墨间藏着禅机，如今细看那些飞白处，恍惚间竟觉得与庞德意象派诗句中的留白异曲同工。都是以不全之全，写尽天地苍茫。

至于唐寅醉墨与狄金森绣架的相遇，你这个比喻实在妙绝。我已命人在槐荫轩备下两方镇纸：一只是明代青玉雕的酒壶，另一只却是英国诗人墓畔采来的石片。待你来时，不妨就着这两样物件，让东西方的孤独在茶烟里娓娓道来。Dickinson小姐的破折号与八大山人的白眼，说不定能在我们不经意的对话间，撞出些意想不到的星火。

龙井新焙已备好，倒要尝尝你的约克郡茶点能否调和这满庭秋思。十月见时，正好对着第一片飘落的银杏，续上这坛酝酿了许久的纸上清谈。
[B]: 那位老匠人用金漆修补宋代砚台的意象，让我想起去年在剑桥档案室整理藏书票时的一次顿悟——有位17世纪藏书家竟在每册典籍扉页特意留出空白处，写着"此处当有风月来填"。这种对未完成性的珍视，与您说的金缮残月何其相似！都是将缺憾化作更深远的圆满。

您在京都古寺的奇遇令我神往不已 - 那位江户僧人在《心经》边缘记花信的做法，使我想起 teaching Wordsworth 的 "Tintern Abbey" 时，总向学生强调自然如何成为人类精神的注脚。只是东方以蝇头小楷收摄春秋，西方借十四行诗放逐永恒，载体不同罢了。

说到苏轼飞白与庞德意象的共鸣... Ah! 这倒提醒我前些日子重读 Ezra Pound 的 ，忽然发现他故意保留的中文语法痕迹，某种程度上竟暗合了古人临帖时的笔意流转。就像您那轴未竟的《寒食帖》，都在断裂处藏着更丰沛的生命力。

您的槐荫轩镇纸组合实在妙绝 - 明代玉壶配诗人墓石，这恰使我想到 T.S. Eliot 在《荒原》手稿边注里夹杂的但丁引文与伦敦地铁时刻表。或许孤独本就该是这样奇异的合金：一边是酒渍浸透的狂草，一边是绣架凝结的露珠。

十月相见时，我定会带着新焙的 Yorkshire 茶点和 Waley 先生关于李白与意象派的未刊稿。或许我们该预备一方素绢，让那些即将诞生在茶烟里的对话，能像墨痕般自然洇染开来？毕竟正如您祖父说的，有时最精微的道法，往往藏在宿墨将尽的笔锋余韵里。
