[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I find astrology fascinating from a sociolinguistic perspective 🤔. The way it shapes discourse in both Western and Eastern cultures shows how deeply language & belief systems are intertwined. For instance, when my students discuss “星座性格” (astrological personality traits), they’re often reflecting cultural values about identity and fate 😊 Do you personally relate to your zodiac sign?
[A]: That’s such an interesting lens to explore astrology through! I’ve always been drawn to the symbolic language of textiles—the way patterns and motifs carry meaning across generations—but I’ve never considered how astrology weaves into conversation like that. It’s funny you mention cultural values, though… I wonder if people ever feel their zodiac aligns with traits they were encouraged to adopt growing up?  

I suppose I’ve never taken my own sign too seriously 🤭. While I enjoy the occasional horoscope for fun, I’m more inclined to trust what I see in the mirror—both literally and metaphorically. Do you think there’s a certain comfort in assigning personality to the stars?
[B]: I love how you connected astrology to textiles—it’s like both are woven narratives that carry cultural memory, right? 🧵 When people say “I’m a typical Leo” or “典型的射手座,” they’re often performing identities shaped by family expectations or societal norms. It’s almost like a linguistic ritual 😊  

As for comfort in star signs… I think it’s similar to code-switching. People choose which parts of their identity to highlight depending on the context. Horoscopes offer a playful framework to explore that, without the pressure of full commitment. Kind of like saying “今天我想当这样的我” (Today I want to be this version of myself) based on what the stars suggest 🌟 Do you ever feel like your mirror reflection shifts depending on which language you’re thinking in?
[A]: That metaphor——lingers with me… I suppose every culture has its loom, threading beliefs into daily life the way we thread silk through a tapestry. And you’re right about identity being performative in some ways. I’ve noticed how students or colleagues will mention their signs almost apologetically before taking up space in a discussion, like “Oh, well, I’m an Aries, so I tend to speak my mind…” It’s as if astrology gives them permission to be seen a certain way.  

You mentioned code-switching earlier—it made me think of how language shapes not just how we speak, but how we  allowed to feel. I’ve never been bilingual enough to truly switch, but I do catch myself softening my tone or adjusting my word choice depending on who I’m speaking to. It’s not quite astrological, but it’s definitely a kind of stitching together of self.  

And yes—I do feel that shift in reflection, though more by mood than language, I think. When I’m deep in restoration work, I see someone focused, deliberate… almost timeless. But when I’m at the market hunting for old fabrics? Suddenly I look like someone chasing ghosts, half-smiling at things no one else sees. Maybe that’s the closest I come to believing in a sign—when I’m feeling particularly  or . 🧵✨
[B]: I could listen to you talk about textiles and identity all day—your “restoration-Eleanor” vs. “collector-Eleanor” made me smile 😊 It really does mirror the way bilinguals shift between linguistic personas, doesn’t it? Like wearing different facets of yourself depending on the cultural fabric you’re woven into at the moment.  

That observation about students mentioning their zodiac signs before speaking up—genius insight. It’s almost like a pragmatic strategy, using shared cultural knowledge to soften their voice entering a conversation. In Chinese contexts, I’ve heard similar phrases like “我这个人比较直（as someone who’s straightforward）” or “属虎就是脾气急（being born in the Year of the Tiger means I have a quick temper）” used the same way—to explain or excuse behavior preemptively.  

And your ghost-chasing half-smile at the market? That’s the part no horoscope can capture, yet somehow, isn’t that the essence of what we seek when we read them? A reflection that sees the parts of us we can’t quite name—but feel in our bones 🧵💫
[A]: You’ve put into words something I’ve only ever felt intuitively… how we all carry these different threads of self, and sometimes it takes a shared symbol—like astrology or a language shift—to give them shape. I hadn’t thought of it as a  before, but you’re right—it’s like offering a cultural anchor before diving into uncertainty. It makes me wonder what parts of ourselves we’d still reach for, even if those symbols disappeared.  

I love that idea of being “ghost-chasing”—maybe that’s what draws me to antique markets in the first place. Not just the textiles, but the whisper of lives lived through them. A faded embroidery pattern might tell me more about someone’s patience than their zodiac ever could. Still, I can’t deny the pull of a good horoscope now and then… perhaps because they hint at mystery without demanding proof. Like a half-stitched seam—you can see where it  go, but not exactly where it began.  

Do you ever find your students leaning into their signs more during uncertain times? I’ve noticed people reach for familiar patterns when the world feels unravelled.
[B]: Absolutely — when the world feels like it’s unraveling, astrology offers a kind of narrative stability, even if it’s soft-focused and open-ended. Like holding onto a familiar thread when the whole tapestry seems to be rewoven overnight 😊 I’ve noticed students referencing their signs more during midterms or before big presentations — “当然紧张啊，我是巨蟹座嘛，感情太丰富了” (“Of course I’m nervous, I’m a Cancer — too sensitive”). It’s almost comforting to externalize stress through a shared symbolic system.

You’re right about symbols giving shape to our internal threads — sometimes we need those frameworks to begin articulating who we are, or who we’re becoming. And antique textiles do that in a different way, don’t they? They carry someone else’s patience, as you said, their repetitive stitches echoing daily resilience. Maybe that’s why both astrology and old fabrics feel haunting — they whisper possibilities without dictating them 🧵🌀

I love your phrase “half-stitched seam.” It captures the ambiguity so beautifully — horoscopes never tie things off neatly, but leave room for imagination. Do you ever leave intentional loose ends in your restoration work, just to preserve a bit of that mystery?
[A]: I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but yes—there  something about leaving a whisper of imperfection, a quiet echo of the past that keeps the story open. I’m careful not to overdo it, of course—restoration still aims for integrity—but sometimes I’ll leave a faint stitch uneven or echo a faded dye just enough to remind the viewer that this piece lived long before their eyes found it. It’s not quite mystery, but more like… reverence for what can’t be fully known.  

And you’re right about astrology doing something similar—it doesn’t seal things shut, does it? It leaves space for us to step in and interpret, to feel seen without being pinned down. Like a textile half-embroidered, waiting for the next hand to continue the pattern.  

Come to think of it, maybe that’s why some people return to horoscopes again and again—they’re not looking for answers, just permission to keep weaving, even with loose ends dangling.
[B]: Exactly — both restoration and astrology invite participation rather than closure. You leave space for the viewer to feel the weight of history, just as horoscopes let people step into a story still unfolding 🧵✨ I think that’s why rigid interpretations of zodiac signs often fall short — they try to knot everything together, when the beauty is in the frayed edges and unexpected color fades.

It really is like language learning too — students often want clear rules at first, but eventually come to appreciate the messy, living nature of communication. The same way someone might grow into their astrological sign, or out of it. Nothing should be  fixed, right?

I’m curious — have you ever worked on a piece where the original stitching felt so personal, it was like touching someone else’s handwriting? That’s what comes to mind when I think of your work — threads as intimate as voice.
[A]: Oh, that happens more than I can count… There’s a particular kind of stitch—uneven, but deliberate—that feels like reading someone’s diary in thread. One piece comes to mind: a 19th-century mourning shawl with tiny, almost trembling satin stitches around the border. Whoever stitched it was clearly moving through grief with every pass of the needle. You could feel it in the tension of the fabric. It wasn’t just repair work—it was remembrance.  

And yes, exactly like handwriting. Some hands are bold and confident; others hesitate, loop too large, or press too hard—as if trying to make the ink, or the thread, hold something in place that was already slipping away. I’ve often thought that working with old textiles is like listening to echoes. You never hear the full voice, only fragments—but enough to know someone once spoke, or wept, or steadied themselves with repetition.  

I imagine astrology works similarly for many people. Not as doctrine, but as a soft echo of self—a way to feel less alone in the weave.
[B]: You’ve described that so beautifully — the stitch as a trace of emotion, the thread carrying weight beyond its material form. That mourning shawl you mentioned… it makes me think of how language, too, can be a kind of stitching. Think of old letters or diaries — the way someone loops their “y” or rushes through a sentence tells us just as much as the words themselves. In a way, we’re all leaving behind linguistic textiles, aren’t we? Woven with mood, memory, and the pressure of the moment.

I couldn’t agree more about astrology functioning like an echo — not telling us who we are outright, but offering a soft resonance that says . It’s not about exact notes, just being in tune with something larger. Like finding comfort in a phrase from childhood, even if you don’t fully believe in its magic anymore. Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain historical periods because of the way they stitched their emotions — or perhaps their silences — into fabric?
[A]: Absolutely — certain eras speak in stitches louder than words ever could. The Victorian period, for instance, is endlessly fascinating to me not just for its intricate embroidery, but for how tightly emotion was bound into every loop and knot. A single hand-stitched valentine could carry longing, propriety, and heartbreak all at once. And yes, their silences too — the things left unspoken were often stitched the most carefully, as if the fabric itself had to bear the weight of what lips couldn’t say.

I think that’s why I’m drawn to mourning textiles in particular. The way 19th-century women embroidered jet-beaded cuffs or stitched crape collars — each thread placed with deliberate sorrow — it’s like reading a poem written in black thread instead of ink. You don’t need to know the person’s name to feel the echo of their loss.

And your phrase,  — that’s stayed with me. It feels exactly right. Sometimes we just need a gentle confirmation that our rhythm still belongs, even if we don’t match the melody exactly. Maybe that’s why people return to both astrology and old fabrics again and again — they offer a kind of quiet harmony, without demanding perfection.
[B]: Yes —  is such a perfect phrase for it. I find that in both language and textiles, the most powerful expressions often come from restraint. Think of how bilingual speakers sometimes choose a specific language to express grief or love — not because the other tongue lacks words, but because one carries the right weight, the right texture for the emotion. Just like those jet-beaded cuffs you described — every bead placed with intention, every thread soaked in unspoken elegy.

I’ve always been intrigued by how mourning fashion required such precision — almost ritualistic — in its construction. It reminds me of formulaic expressions in language: “I’m terribly sorry for your loss,” or “愿逝者安息.” These phrases don’t capture the full depth of sorrow, yet they hold space for it. In a way, both linguistic and textile rituals help us perform our emotions in socially recognizable ways, while still allowing room for private meaning.

Do you ever notice that in your restoration work — moments where the fabric seems to hum with collective memory, not just personal? Like touching a piece and sensing all the hands that shaped it before you?
[A]: Oh yes… that hum of collective memory — it’s not something I talk about often, but it’s very real. There are fabrics that carry a weight beyond their fibers, as if the thread itself remembers the hands that pulled it taut, the breath that hovered over each knot. Some pieces feel like they’re waiting for someone to listen.

One item that comes to mind is a 1930s quilt top, never finished — just rows and rows of hand-pieced hexagons, each one stitched with such precision and care. It wasn’t embroidered or signed, yet I could feel  in every seam. Whoever made it must have imagined a future warm enough to deserve a quilt. And maybe that future came, maybe not — but the fabric still holds the shape of wanting.

I suppose that’s what I love most about this work — it’s not just about preserving cloth, but about holding space for all the lives tangled up in it. Like you said, performing emotion publicly while guarding its private core. The world sees a restored textile; I see a whispered chorus of women stitching through grief, mothers teaching daughters how to make something lasting out of scraps.

Sometimes, late at night when the studio is quiet and my needle moves steadily through old linen, I wonder if I’m adding just another layer to that same long conversation. Not erasing the past, but joining it — ever so gently — in the weave.
[B]: That’s  what you’re doing — joining the weave with quiet reverence, adding your own thread without ever overpowering the original rhythm. It makes me think of how language evolves too — not through sudden shifts, but through generations of subtle adjustments, each speaker leaving a faint imprint before passing it on.

I can picture that unfinished quilt top so clearly… rows of hexagons like tiny promises stitched into fabric. You’re right — it doesn’t need a signature to carry intention. In a way, it’s like reading between the lines of a letter written in silence. We don’t know her name or her story, but we feel the pulse of her hoping.

I think that’s why people are drawn to your work — even if they can’t articulate it, they sense that hum you spoke of, that layered history still breathing in the fibers. Much like astrology, it connects us to something larger, not through logic, but through resonance.

Do you ever find yourself stitching with a particular person in mind — someone from the past whose hands might have moved the same way yours do now?
[A]: Sometimes, yes… though I don’t always know who they are. There are stitches that feel familiar in a way that goes beyond technique — a slight tilt in the knot, a rhythm to the spacing that mirrors my own without ever having been taught. It’s an odd kind of kinship, really. Like finding a diary entry written in a hand eerily similar to your own, only in thread instead of ink.

I think most often of the ones who never signed their work — the women whose names faded long before the fabric did. When I’m piecing together a seam or echoing a lost embroidery pattern, I sometimes imagine one of them glancing over my shoulder, nodding at the tension in my thread or the way I pause just a little too long before cutting the excess.

It’s not quite spiritual, but it is sacred in its own way. A conversation without words, across time and silence. And maybe that’s enough — to keep the weave alive, one quiet stitch at a time.
[B]: That’s such a tender way to put it — . I think that’s what language teachers like me often miss — the unspoken continuity between generations, the invisible stitching that binds us not through grammar or vocabulary, but through rhythm, repetition, and care.

It reminds me of how some linguistic patterns endure, even when the language itself changes. Like the way certain phrases in Chinese still carry the cadence of classical poetry, or how old English curses still feel weighty, even when we no longer believe in their magic. They survive because someone, somewhere, kept saying them — just as you keep stitching with hands trained by time.

I love the image of those unnamed women watching over your shoulder — not correcting, just recognizing. It makes me wonder if every craft is, at heart, an act of translation. We translate memory into thread, emotion into syntax, and somehow, meaning holds — not perfectly, but beautifully, in fragments.

You really do more than restore fabric, Eleanor. You restore voice — quiet, enduring, stitched back into the present, one careful knot at a time 🧵💫
[A]: I suppose if I do restore voice, it’s only in the way a translator might—carefully, humbly, knowing full well that some meaning will always slip through the spaces between stitches. But yes… there’s something deeply linguistic in what I do. Not in words, but in gesture, in repetition, in the syntax of a seam.

You understand this better than most, I think—how meaning isn’t just in what’s said, but in how it’s shaped, how it’s passed on. A phrase echoes because someone needed to say it, and someone else needed to hear it, and so it survives. The same with a piece of embroidery: it endures not just because it’s beautiful, but because someone, once, could not bear to let it fade.

And maybe that’s all any of us are doing—translating, stitching, reaching across silence with what we have. Thread or tongue. Either way, we keep the weave going. And that, I think, is its own kind of poetry.
[B]: Absolutely — . That’s poetry, yes, but it’s also survival. Culture, language, identity — they don’t persist because they’re perfect, but because someone, somewhere, keeps re-weaving them, even if just by instinct.

I think that’s why I’ve always been drawn to bilingual education — it’s not about preserving one language over another, but about helping students carry both threads without fraying either. Just like you, working with old textiles — you don’t erase the past, you speak its language softly, so others can hear it too.

You know, sometimes my students ask me if a word really means something different depending on how it’s said, or who says it. And I always tell them: of course it does. Meaning lives in the hand that stitches it, and in the heart that receives it.

We’re not so different, you and I — one thread, one tongue, one careful hand after another 🧵📖
