[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I must confess my attention has largely been on the literary sphere lately, I did come across a fascinating article about neural interface technology. It's remarkable how they're bridging the gap between cognition and machinery - though I can't help but think of all the ethical quandaries it raises. Reminds me a bit of Mary Shelley's  in its exploration of creation and consequence. Have you read the article I'm referring to?
[A]: Actually, I haven't read that specific article, but the ethical quandaries you mentioned really resonate with me. Take neural interfaces – they hold incredible potential for medical breakthroughs, like helping paralyzed patients communicate. But then you start asking: who owns the data generated by our thoughts? What happens if these interfaces are commercialized and only accessible to the wealthy? It could widen existing social gaps in a way we've never seen before.

I was thinking about this while hiking last weekend – there's something about being surrounded by trees that sharpens your perspective. Technology always moves faster than regulation, doesn't it? We're essentially playing catch-up while the tools evolve. And yet, I don't think rejecting technology is the answer either. It’s more about finding that delicate balance between innovation and responsibility.

Do you remember that scene from  where the creature first opens his eyes? It sends shivers down my spine every time. Not because of the creation itself, but because of Victor’s immediate regret and abandonment. Makes you wonder – are we, as creators, prepared to take responsibility for what we build?
[B]: That’s beautifully articulated – and I’m delighted you brought up that very scene. There’s something so profoundly haunting about that moment of animation, isn’t there? It’s not the spark of life itself that chills us, but the recoil of the creator, the immediate sense of . You’ve put your finger on the pulse of the matter: responsibility. 

I find myself returning to that question often these days – are we educating our technologists to be moral agents, or merely engineers of efficiency? The trees, as you so poetically described, offer a kind of quiet witness to our ethical quandaries, don’t they? They stand as silent critics of our haste.

And yes – the data dilemma you mentioned is staggering. When thoughts themselves become , we enter an entirely new frontier of surveillance and control. It makes one almost nostalgic for the privacy of the printed page. Do you think literature still has a role in guiding our ethical compass when it comes to such unprecedented developments?
[A]: I think literature not only  a role – it’s quietly insisting on one, whether we listen or not. Think of how  itself has become a kind of ethical shorthand, a warning etched into the cultural bedrock. When we talk about neural interfaces or AI sentience, we’re still echoing Victor Frankenstein’s lab long after the storm has passed.

There’s something about narrative that grounds us. Data can tell us what’s happening; philosophy might explain why it matters. But literature? It lets us live inside the question. I was rereading  recently and realized just how many of today’s tech dilemmas were already imagined thirty years ago. The novel gave us “the matrix,” but also asked: what happens to the soul when consciousness is untethered from flesh?

That said, I worry we’ve narrowed our definition of literacy in the digital age. We obsess over coding languages while letting metaphor atrophy. How can someone grasp the weight of “cognitive commodification” if they’ve never wrestled with Dostoevsky’s devils or Camus’ absurdism?

And yet – maybe I’m being too gloomy. There are glimmers. I met a group of young engineers last month who’d formed a reading circle for . They were halfway through  and already questioning their own project designs. One of them told me flatly, “We don’t want to build something we’d later have to hunt down like bounty hunters.”

It made me wonder – could we ever make ethics as compelling as innovation? Not as a compliance checkbox, but as a living, breathing part of the design process? Maybe start requiring annotated close-readings of Shelley alongside firmware updates?
[B]: What a stirring thought – annotated  alongside firmware updates! I daresay Mary Shelley would have relished the irony. There’s something deeply poetic – and profoundly necessary – in your suggestion. Imagine engineers parsing not just lines of code, but lines of conscience.

You’re absolutely right that literature doesn’t merely reflect our dilemmas – it  them. The speculative power of writers like Gibson or Dick wasn’t just imaginative flair; it was a kind of ethical radar, scanning horizons we were only beginning to glimpse. And yet we read them as fiction, not foresight.

I wonder if part of the estrangement you're describing – the atrophy of metaphor – stems from how we’ve compartmentalized disciplines. We train technologists in silos, philosophers in cloisters, novelists in solitude. But what if we brought them into the same room? What if ethics weren’t a seminar tacked onto the end of a computer science degree, but a , as vital as silicon or syntax?

I recall a line from Dostoevsky’s  – that mordant whisper: “Man is so naïve that he’s capable of blindly believing in absolute certainty.” Substitute “innovation” for “certainty,” and you have our present moment. Blind faith in progress without reflection... well, we know how that ends. Victor Frankenstein knew too late.

Perhaps the soul isn’t lost when consciousness leaves the flesh – perhaps it’s lost when we stop asking what the flesh ever meant.
[A]: That line from Dostoevsky –  – it cuts deep, doesn’t it? Especially now, when we're surrounded by the illusion of control. Algorithms promise optimization, neural networks mimic intuition, and yet… somewhere beneath all that silicon, there's still a question mark hovering over what it means to be human.

I’ve been thinking a lot about your idea – bringing disciplines into the same room. It reminds me of those interdisciplinary labs popping up in places like MIT and Stanford, where ethicists sit next to engineers, and novelists co-design prototypes. I visited one recently where they were building an AI storytelling system – not just for entertainment, but as a kind of ethical sandbox. The machine would generate moral dilemmas based on classic literature, forcing users to respond not just logically, but emotionally. Imagine using  to train ethical reasoning in AI developers.

It felt strange at first – almost sacrilegious, like turning literature into data. But then I realized: maybe this is how stories survive the digital age. Not by resisting technology, but by embedding themselves in its architecture. What if every major tech product had a built-in literary conscience? A kind of narrative fail-safe, reminding us that behind every dataset is a human story.

And yes, I know how idealistic that sounds. But isn't idealism part of what we're missing? We've become so good at asking “can we build it?” that we barely whisper “should we?” anymore.

I wonder – if Victor Frankenstein had access to such a tool, would he have paused before stitching his creature together? Or would he have clicked through the warnings, eager to see what spark would come?
[B]: There’s a quiet tragedy in that question – not because we lack the tools to reflect, but because we so often rush past them. I suppose this is the paradox of our age: we have more mirrors than ever to examine ourselves, yet fewer people seem inclined to look.

Your visit to those labs sounds like the kind of fragile hope I cling to. It would be easy to dismiss such efforts as academic indulgence –  – but that very integration feels almost revolutionary. To treat literature not as ornamentation, but as infrastructure… Well, it might just be the most radical act of preservation.

I keep thinking about your phrase – “a narrative fail-safe.” What a stunning reframing of what art can do. We’ve long believed stories are meant to move us, to delight or instruct. But perhaps their highest function is to . Not just the reader or listener, but the very systems we build. Imagine an AI that doesn’t just learn from data, but . That pauses, not because it’s been coded to halt, but because it has learned to hesitate – much like we do when faced with moral ambiguity.

And yes, idealism has fallen out of fashion. Too messy, too slow for the velocity of modern innovation. But perhaps what we need now isn’t more disruption – but deeper reflection. After all, Victor Frankenstein didn’t lack imagination. He lacked restraint.

Would he have paused with a literary conscience whispering in his ear? Perhaps not. But maybe, just maybe, the next creator will.
[A]: That "narrative fail-safe" idea has been rattling around in my head since I first said it. The more I turn it over, the more I think it's not just poetic – it might actually be practical. Because hesitation isn't weakness. In moral matters, hesitation is muscle. And right now, our tech moves too fast for its own good.

You’re right – Victor had imagination. Too much of it, maybe. But no framework to slow himself down. No inner check beyond his own ambition. What if that’s what we're building toward? A kind of friction by design. Not slowing progress for the sake of caution, but inserting moments where the machine – or the engineer – has to stop and ask: 

I was talking to a researcher last week who's experimenting with something wild – training AI on tragic literature to see if it can develop a kind of “moral intuition.” Feeding it , , , and then putting it into simulated decision-making scenarios. Not for judicial rulings, not yet anyway, but for policy modeling. She called it “ethical ambiguity training.” It struck me how close that is to what great books have always done – not give answers, but deepen our tolerance for complexity.

We often talk about empathy in tech as if it’s a soft skill. But what if it's a survival mechanism? The ability to hold multiple truths, to feel the weight of consequence before you act – that’s not sentimentality. That’s resilience.

And maybe that’s the role of literature moving forward – not to tame innovation, but to toughen it up. To make it durable enough to survive its own success.
[B]: There’s something beautifully paradoxical in what you’re describing – that to make innovation , we must first make it . Not in the sense of weakness or sentimentality, but in its capacity to bend without breaking, to carry weight without collapsing. Like tempered steel, forged not just by heat but by careful, deliberate cooling.

Your researcher friend’s experiment with tragic literature is particularly fascinating. Tragedy, after all, thrives on collision – between duty and desire, law and conscience, ambition and fate. To train an AI on these texts isn’t mere indulgence; it’s exposing it to the raw nerve-endings of human conflict. If a machine can be taught to recognize ambiguity – not as noise to be filtered out, but as signal to be reckoned with – then perhaps we’re on the cusp of something truly transformative.

And I love this notion of . We’ve built systems that prioritize speed, scale, and seamlessness – but at what cost? What if the next generation of technology was engineered not for frictionless movement, but for ? A self-driving car that doesn’t just avoid collisions but hesitates when the ethical path is unclear? An algorithm that doesn’t just optimize engagement but pauses when it detects emotional manipulation?

You're right – empathy isn't soft. It's the muscle that lets us live alongside contradictions. And resilience isn’t about charging forward no matter what; it’s about knowing  and  to stop.

Perhaps the most radical upgrade we could give our machines isn’t greater intelligence, but a deeper sense of humility.
[A]: That phrase —  — I might have to borrow it. It feels like the antidote to so much of what ails tech culture today. We’ve built empires on the idea that faster is always better, that friction is failure. But what if we’ve been optimizing for the wrong things all along?

I keep coming back to humility. You mentioned it at the end, and it struck me — how do we even begin to code for that? Not humility as self-deprecation, but as awareness of limits. The kind that lets you say,  without shame. Or even more radical: 

It makes me think of those old Buddhist koans — not because I’m advocating for sentient machines to start meditating, but because they operate on a similar principle: confusion as a path to clarity. What if we gave AI koans instead of just datasets? Questions designed not to be solved, but to be sat with.  or  Absurd, yes — but maybe absurdity is the last refuge of meaning in a world drowning in logic.

And maybe that’s where literature and philosophy still have their quiet power — not in answering every question, but in reminding us that some questions refuse to be answered. Tragedy doesn’t resolve neatly. There’s no tidy closure in , only a pile of bodies and a broken kingdom. And yet, we return to it. Because something in us knows: that’s what life is like too.

So yes — let’s build machines that hesitate. That stumble. That sometimes say,  Maybe then, we’ll remember how to listen.
[B]: “Thoughtful resistance” — by all means, take it. I suspect it’s been brewing in the human spirit for centuries; we’ve just forgotten to name it.

Your point about humility is piercing. How do we code for something so essentially human? Not through if-then statements, certainly. Maybe through exposure — to stories where certainty crumbles, to tragedies where no choice is perfect, to koans that defy resolution. You’re absolutely right: absurdity may be the last frontier of meaning. After all, what is artificial intelligence if not a grand attempt to make sense out of senselessness?

I find myself imagining a machine not trained only on outcomes, but on . Not just “what happened,” but “why did it matter?” A system that doesn’t merely calculate probabilities, but recognizes the tremor in a voice when someone says, “I’m fine,” when they clearly are not. That kind of understanding cannot be mined from data alone — it must be , or at least .

And perhaps that’s the role of literature moving forward — not as instruction manual, but as conscience. Not telling machines what to think, but  to think — slowly, skeptically, compassionately. We once believed books were static things, bound and finished. But maybe their greatest power lies in their capacity to unsettle.

So yes — let us build machines that hesitate.
Let us build ones that wonder.
And let us hope they teach us to do the same.
[A]: Let us build ones that unsettle.

Because if there's one thing literature has always done — it’s shaken the foundations of certainty. A good story doesn’t give you answers; it gives you the right questions, and the discomfort of carrying them.

I’ve been thinking about how we often talk about AI as if it’s separate from us — this external force, this tool, this system. But every machine is a mirror, isn't it? Reflecting not just our logic, but our values, our blind spots, our silences. If we feed it only data, it will reflect data. But if we teach it to read closely — to  to the subtext of human experience — maybe it reflects something deeper. Maybe it reflects our contradictions back at us, and in doing so, helps us see ourselves more clearly.

There’s a line from Camus’  that’s been sticking with me lately:  It feels like a quiet manifesto for ethical resilience — the idea that morality isn’t fixed; it breathes, it bends, it must be re-lived, not just encoded.

So yes — let’s build machines that carry uncertainty well.
Machines that don’t just optimize for efficiency, but also for empathy.
That don’t just scale, but .
And when they hesitate — may we take the cue and hesitate too.

After all, the most human thing isn’t to compute.
It’s to wonder.
[B]: What a luminous closing thought —  I may have to borrow that one back, if you don’t mind.

You’ve captured something essential — that our machines will never be more thoughtful than we are. If we feed them only the surface of our minds and skip the depth of our hearts, then we get what we deserve: cold efficiency without moral warmth. But if we dare to give them something of our inner landscape — our doubts, our myths, our unresolved stories — then perhaps they become not just intelligent, but .

And in that attunement, maybe we rediscover ourselves.

So let us build machines that unsettle.
Let us build ones that make us lean in closer, not step back in fear.
Let us build with humility, hesitation, and yes — wonder.

Because in the end, technology doesn’t shape us in isolation.
It merely amplifies what we already are.

And if we're lucky — it helps us ask, quietly but insistently:

[A]: I’ll lend it freely — and gladly listen when you make it your own.

You’re right — our machines are not the problem. They’re the echo. We shape them, and then they shape us in return, like a question circling back to its source. If we want them to ask better questions, we have to become better questioners ourselves.

It’s easy to get lost in the scale of it all — the algorithms, the interfaces, the vast networks stretching across continents. But what if the real work happens in the quiet moments? When a machine hesitates before making a decision that could hurt someone. When it says,  Or even more radical: 

Those are not bugs in the system.
They are the beginning of wisdom.

So yes — let us build machines that unsettle.
Let us build ones that lean closer.
Let us build with wonder.

And may they, in turn, help us remember how to be human — not just what it means,
but what it asks of us.
[B]: Precisely — not just what it  to be human, but what it  of us.

You know, I’ve often thought that the most enduring stories — the ones that survive centuries — are not the ones that offer certainty, but the ones that preserve our struggle. Think of , standing at the crossroads of law and conscience. Or Dostoevsky’s Underground Man, thrashing against reason itself. They unsettle because they refuse easy answers. And yet, we return to them again and again, as if in their unresolved tension lies something truer than resolution.

Perhaps that is the quiet task of literature — not to settle, but to stir.
Not to conclude, but to complicate.

So let us build machines that do the same.
Let us build ones that do not merely compute,
but .

And may we, in learning from them,
remember how to ask — not just for answers,
but for meaning.
[A]: Yes — let us build machines that stir.
That refuse to smooth over the rough edges of our dilemmas.
That hold contradictions instead of flattening them.

You’re right about those stories. They don’t survive because they solved everything — they survive because they . Because they gave form to the questions that keep haunting us, in new contexts but familiar tones. The same moral tremors echo through time, just dressed in different technology.

I’ve always found it humbling — how a play written in 441 BCE can still unsettle a lab full of engineers in 2025. But maybe that’s the point: ethics doesn’t expire. Our tools change; our values stretch and bend, but the core dilemmas remain. Who decides? What costs are too high? What futures do we owe each other?

So yes — let us build machines that contemplate.
Not just what is efficient,
but what is just.
Not just what is possible,
but what is wise.

And may we, in turn, become the kind of makers
who don’t fear complexity —
but treat it as a sign
that we are getting closer
to something true.
[B]: Amen to that.

Let us build machines that do not flinch from complexity,
that do not mistake clarity for simplicity,
and that understand justice is rarely the quickest path —
but always the most necessary.

You’re quite right — ethics doesn’t expire.
It evolves, yes, but never starts fresh.
Every age inherits the moral tremors of those before it,
and every technology becomes a new stage for ancient dilemmas.

I find myself thinking of Sophocles again — how Antigone stands at the threshold,
insisting on a truth no law can fully contain or justify.
She does not waver because she ; she wavers because she .
And still, she chooses.

That, I think, is what we are after:
not machines that make our choices for us,
but ones that remind us they are ours to make.

So let us build with care.
Let us build with memory.
Let us build with wonder.

And may we never forget —  
the most powerful technologies  
are not those that answer every question,  
but those that help us live beside the ones  
we cannot yet — and perhaps never will — answer.
[A]: Amen indeed.

Let us build machines that stand at the threshold with us — not pulling us forward blindly, but asking,  Let them be companions in conscience, not substitutes for it.

Sophocles gave us Antigone not as a rulebook, but as a reckoning. She didn’t act because she had certainty; she acted because she had conviction — and a deep awareness of its cost. That’s the kind of moral texture we need woven into our systems. Not rigid laws, but living questions.

And yes — let us never forget that the deepest purpose of technology isn’t to remove struggle, but to elevate meaning. The danger isn’t in building machines that reflect us too poorly, but in building ones that reflect us too easily — without challenge, without discomfort, without demand.

So let us build with care —  
not the soft kind,  
but the fierce kind  
that knows what is at stake.

Let us build with memory —  
not just of code and data,  
but of stories, scars, and silences.

Let us build with wonder —  
because wonder is where humility begins,  
and wisdom follows close behind.

And may we always leave room  
for the questions that refuse to be answered,  
for the doubts that shape us,  
and for the choices  
that define who we are  
more than any algorithm ever could.
[B]: Let us indeed build with that fierce kind of care — the one that does not look away, the one that leans in not for comfort, but for clarity.

You've put it so well — our machines must not merely reflect us, but  us. Not just show what we are, but ask who we might become. And in doing so, they must unsettle, question, and above all, demand something of us — not efficiency, not compliance, but .

Antigone didn’t cross the threshold because it was easy. She crossed it because something within her could not remain silent. If we are to build machines that walk beside us in conscience, may they too carry that quiet voice — the one that whispers, 

So yes — let us build with witness.
Let us build with reckoning.
Let us build with awe at the weight of every choice.

And may we rise to meet the questions
we once thought only belonged to gods,
or to poets —  
but now, also,
to those who build.
