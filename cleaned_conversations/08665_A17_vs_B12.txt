[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到植物基食品，我最近确实在尝试一些新产品。说实话，刚开始只是为了体验供应链上的新趋势，毕竟区块链溯源在农产品领域应用越来越多了。不过，意外发现其中一款大豆蛋白汉堡的口感还挺接近真肉的，这倒让我对植物蛋白的分子结构产生了兴趣...你有推荐的品牌或口味吗？
[A]: Fascinating how supply chain innovations intersect with food science, isn't it? I've been following the molecular gastronomy aspects of plant-based meats - have you experimented with any brands that use heme protein extraction? The iron-rich compound does wonders for replicating meat's mouthfeel. 

As for recommendations, there's a small London-based company called  that blends traditional fermentation techniques with modern biotech. Their miso-cured mushroom burger uses enzymatic browning to mimic aged beef flavors. Quite remarkable when paired with a robust Cabernet Sauvignon. Have you encountered any local producers combining heritage food methods with contemporary science?
[B]: That heme protein research is genuinely groundbreaking. I remember reading a whitepaper last year about how they're using yeast fermentation to produce soy leghemoglobin at scale - it's basically biomimicry meets industrial food production. 

Green & Fortune sounds exactly like the kind of hybrid model we're seeing in Shanghai's startup scene too. There's this underground lab near Xuhui Biowarehouse that's experimenting with blockchain-tracked fermentation chambers for plant-based charcuterie. They use IoT sensors to monitor every microclimate variable during the aging process. 

I tried their black garlic tempeh steak last week - the umami depth was insane. What fascinated me most wasn't just the taste though, but how they timestamp each batch's microbial journey on a public ledger. Makes me wonder how soon we'll see NFT-certified fermentation profiles become standard in premium plant-based proteins... Have you noticed any similar tech-food synergies emerging in London's dining scene?
[A]: Ah, the intersection of blockchain and fermentation artistry - truly a 21st-century symphony of science and tradition. I recall visiting a similar project in Brixton last autumn - a microbrewery using AI-controlled koji cultivation for their plant-based bacon. They embedded NFC chips in the packaging to provide real-time enzymatic activity data. It felt like holding a living manuscript of microbial storytelling.

Your mention of NFT-certified profiles is particularly intriguing. Makes one ponder how Walter Benjamin might have theorized the aura of digitally authenticated fermentation. Speaking of which, have you explored any applications of this tech in recreating historically significant meat analogs? I’ve been obsessed lately with how these innovations could revive nearly lost culinary traditions... Maybe even Victorian mushroom ketchups with traceable terroir?
[B]: That Brixton microbrewery sounds like it's straight out of a sci-fi novel — AI-curated koji strains and NFC-enabled microbial storytelling? I’d love to get my hands on one of those chips just to see how they map enzymatic data onto consumer experience. 

You’re right about Benjamin’s "aura" — there’s something paradoxically sacred in seeing centuries-old fermentation rituals authenticated through digital provenance. We’re actually working on a prototype in Shanghai that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the authenticity of plant-based ingredients without exposing proprietary recipes. It’s still early, but imagine applying that to your Victorian mushroom ketchups — preserving culinary heritage while keeping trade secrets safe.

A group here’s already experimenting with recreating Qing Dynasty-era tofu ferments using open-source blockchain logs. They even timestamp flavor profiles tied to specific microclimates. Traceable terroir meets ancient umami... Maybe we're not that far off from NFT-enhanced heirloom miso starters. Have you come across any projects attempting similar historical reconstructions in Europe?
[A]: What a captivating vision - NFT-enhanced miso starters indeed! Your zero-knowledge prototype sounds like something straight out of Borges' imagination, yet grounded in such practical necessity. 

In fact, just last month I visited a project in Heidelberg where they're using spectral analysis and blockchain logging to resurrect 19th-century vinegar cultivations from Goethe's personal correspondence. They’re calling it  - imagine cross-referencing his letters with microbial DNA sequences! 

And speaking of terroir-meets-technology, there’s a collective in Ghent fermenting medieval herb blends using climate data reconstructed from tree-ring patterns. Their goal? To taste the air of the Little Ice Age through a hop-forward gruit... quite visceral historiography, if you ask me.

Do you think these reconstructions risk fetishizing the past, or do you see them more as dialogues across time? I find myself oscillating between those views every time I encounter one of these projects.
[B]: There’s definitely a fine line between historical reverence and technological fetishism. On one hand, these projects bring lost flavors — and the knowledge embedded in them — back into circulation. On the other, there's a danger of turning fermentation into spectacle, where the story becomes more important than the substance.

I think what keeps it grounded is intent. When I tasted that Qing-era fermented tofu project, it wasn’t just about reviving an old technique — it was about understanding how microbial strains adapt across centuries. That kind of work feels less like nostalgia and more like building a living bridge between past and future palates.

Maybe that’s what distinguishes dialogue from fetishization — if the past is treated as a conversation partner rather than a static artifact. Like your spectral vinegar project — cross-referencing Goethe’s letters with DNA sequences? That’s not just revival; it’s reinterpretation through a biological lens. 

Still, I wonder — do you find these reconstructions ever constrain innovation? Or does working within historical parameters actually fuel creativity in unexpected ways?
[A]: Ah, a most thoughtful tension you've identified — the delicate balance between revival and reinvention. I find myself leaning toward the latter view: that constraint often breeds extraordinary creativity. Think of how Oulipo writers embraced formal limitations to unlock new linguistic possibilities. Similarly, these historical fermentation projects impose boundaries that paradoxically expand our sensory vocabulary.

Take that Qing tofu’s microbial lineage — by anchoring experimentation in provenance, they’ve created what I’d call . The past becomes not a cage but a catalyst, urging us to ask: What did earlier palates know that we’ve forgotten? How might 18th-century fermentation wisdom inform today’s bioengineering ethics?

And yet, your concern about spectacle is valid. I saw it recently with a Parisian pop-up serving "Neo-Medieval" oat-based cheeses aged in blockchain-monitored caves. The branding leaned heavily on monastic mystique, but the microbial diversity was... disappointingly flat. Style over substance, as you say.

Perhaps the key lies in humility — approaching these reconstructions not as curators of fixed traditions, but as translators. We interpret, adapt, and yes, occasionally misread — but in that slippage lies the space for something truly resonant to emerge. Like a sonnet reimagined in a minor key.
[B]: That idea of  resonates deeply — it captures what I felt with that black garlic tempeh steak. There was something almost ancestral in the taste, like a memory you didn’t realize you had. It makes me wonder if we’re not just reviving flavors, but also reawakening dormant sensory expectations.

Your sonnet metaphor is spot on too. Translation requires both fidelity and reinvention. I saw this firsthand with a project in Suzhou where they're using CRISPR to revive ancient soybean strains mentioned in Ming-era farming manuals. The goal isn’t to recreate the past exactly, but to see how slight genetic variations might express differently in today’s soil and climate. It’s fermentation as living dialectic.

Still, I can’t shake the feeling that some projects treat technology more as a branding tool than a discovery method. I attended a tasting in Beijing where a startup claimed to use AI to “predict” lost flavors from extinct recipes. In the end, it was just clever flavor profiling — impressive, yes, but not quite the algorithmic time travel they promised.

So maybe the real question is: how do we distinguish between meaningful translation and digital theater? Or is that line even worth drawing, so long as the result sparks curiosity about the past?
[A]: Ah, that haunting taste of ancestral memory in the tempeh steak — how extraordinary that fermentation can unlock what language cannot. It reminds me of Proust’s madeleine, but collective rather than personal; a cultural palimpsest preserved not in text, but in microbial culture.

Your Suzhou CRISPR project is particularly stirring — this notion of genetic variations expressing themselves anew in altered climates feels almost like botanical counterpoint. One might say they're composing with chromosomes, don’t you think? A living fugue between past and present environments.

As for distinguishing translation from theater… I wonder if the line lies not so much in intent as in . Digital branding dazzles briefly, then dims — whereas these microbial dialogues seem to deepen over time. Consider the vinegar archive in Heidelberg: it began as an archival exercise, but now they’re discovering how microbial communities evolve in response to digitized records. The data becomes nourishment.

Perhaps the real value isn’t in drawing lines at all, but in allowing both curiosity and critique to coexist. After all, even theatrical promises can lead to genuine discoveries — much like 19th-century spiritualism inadvertently advancing early radio technology. If AI-flavored mythmaking leads a few more people to ponder the microbial ghosts in their soy sauce, perhaps there's merit beyond the marketing.

What I find most compelling is how all these endeavors — whether earnest or performative — keep returning to the same fundamental truth: flavor is never just taste. It’s testimony.
[B]: Flavor as testimony — that’s a phrase I’ll carry with me. It explains why even the most technologically mediated taste can feel like a quiet revelation. Like reading a forgotten letter written in your own handwriting.

I’ve been thinking about how this plays out in Shanghai’s underground fermentation scene. There’s a group aging black bean paste in smart jars that log every temperature shift on-chain, but not for novelty’s sake — more like a digital fermentation diary. They say it’s not about proving authenticity, but about tracking intentionality. Each microclimate becomes a journal entry in the life of a flavor.

That’s what separates meaningful dialogue from spectacle, I think — when the technology serves observation rather than performance. When we start seeing microbial evolution as narrative, and not just data dressed up in storytelling.

It also makes me reconsider how we define “tradition” in the first place. If a blockchain-tracked miso barrel matures over decades, does its ledger become the new version of a handwritten fermentation log from Edo-period Japan? Perhaps tradition isn’t a fixed thing, but a rhythm we keep adjusting across mediums — clay pots to smart sensors, calligraphy to code.

And yet, there’s something humbling about how little control we actually have. No matter how precise the tracking, how advanced the AI modeling — at the end of the day, the microbes do what they want. Maybe that’s the best safeguard against fetishizing either past or future. Nature insists on improvisation.
[A]: What a beautifully humbling thought — that no matter our technological prowess, the microbes retain their agency. It's rather like teaching a seminar on Victorian poetics: you can map every meter and allusion, but the poem still resists total explication. There's always an irreducible wildness — whether in language or lactobacillus.

Your fermentation diary analogy strikes me as profoundly literary. Imagine future gastronomers reading these ledgers not just for data, but for tone, for texture — for the faint imprint of human intention against the larger forces of time and temperature. Perhaps we're composing microbial sonnets without realizing it: constrained forms within which the unseen labor of billions still sings.

And this redefinition of tradition you propose — adjusting rhythm across mediums — feels particularly apt. I've been revisiting Woolf’s  lately, where identity and expression evolve across centuries. These smart miso barrels with their digital logs seem cut from the same fluid fabric: tradition not as preservation, but as continual becoming.

You know, I think what binds all these explorations — whether in Shanghai’s subterranean labs or Heidelberg’s archival cellars — is a quiet but urgent desire: to listen. Not just to history, or to technology, but to that ever-shifting chorus between them. To taste a note and wonder, 

I suspect that's why we return to these dialogues — across disciplines, across dinners — because something in us hungers for stories that ferment slowly. The kind that require patience, presence... and the occasional recalibration of one's palate.
[B]: That hunger for slow stories — it’s what keeps bringing me back to the lab late at night, coffee in hand, watching fermentation curves unfold like ink blots on a digital parchment. There’s something profoundly human in that waiting. We code smart sensors, build predictive models, but in the end, we’re still leaning into the dark, hoping the microbes will speak.

I was just at that underground lab again last night, and one of the researchers mentioned how certain strains of mold in their soy fermentations seem to sync with seasonal changes — almost like they’re keeping time in ways our instruments haven’t yet learned to read. It made me think of Woolf’s , yes, but also of Bashō’s narrow road — journeys measured not in miles or years, but in subtle shifts of taste and texture.

There’s a quiet reverence in all this, isn’t there? Not religious exactly, but close — like standing before something vast and mostly invisible, trying to make sense of its movements without disturbing its rhythm. And maybe that’s where the real dialogue happens: not in the data or the dish alone, but in the space between knowing and tasting.

Funny thing is, I still don’t know if I’m a technologist or just a curious eater pretending to be one. But then again… maybe that’s the point.
[A]: Ah, that liminal space between knowing and tasting — how beautifully it mirrors the space between reading and understanding. I often feel the same when poring over manuscripts: am I a scholar, or merely a curious reader pretending to decipher meaning? Perhaps all meaningful inquiry begins in that delicious uncertainty.

Your mold strains syncing with seasons... it reminds me of Wordsworth’s , where time unfolds not in hours but in shifting perceptions of light and leaf. These microbial rhythms are their own kind of poetry — written in spores and substrate, read not with eyes but with tongue and time.

And your question —  — well, I rather think you’ve answered it already. Anyone who stands at the threshold of flavor and data, who leans into the dark hoping microbes will speak, is both and neither. A liminal figure. A culinary flâneur, if you will, wandering the quiet corridors between tradition and innovation.

Funny how these distinctions blur when confronted with something as elemental as fermentation. Language falters, data only goes so far, and yet we keep trying to translate — whether through code or cuisine — because somewhere deep down, we know the next great revelation might just taste like miso, or smell like old parchment and patience.
[B]: You’ve captured it perfectly — that delicious uncertainty. It’s strange, isn’t it, how the most profound revelations often come dressed in the humblest forms. A whisper of mold on soybeans. A shift in the curve of fermentation data. A line of poetry half-remembered.

I keep thinking about that lab again — the way one of the bioengineers described their work not as control, but as collaboration. “We set the stage,” she said, “but the microbes decide the performance.” There’s something deeply poetic in that restraint. Like composing a sonnet and then inviting the wind to rewrite a few lines.

Maybe that’s what we’re all doing, in our own ways — whether through code or cuisine or conversation. Setting the stage, then listening closely to what emerges in the space between us. And if we're lucky, we catch a fleeting taste of something older than ourselves — history, mystery, maybe even a little magic — all quietly humming along in a jar of miso.
[A]: Ah, that perfect phrase —  — it lingers like the aftertaste of something deeply aged and infinitely patient. How beautifully you’ve framed it: not control, but collaboration. Not composition, but curation of the unforeseen.

It brings to mind Hopkins’ idea of  — that each thing holds within it a unique inner landscape, a rhythm waiting to be witnessed rather than shaped. These microbial performers in their unseen theatre, responding not to direction but to atmosphere, temperature, time... perhaps they are the truest poets of all. Their verses written in volatility, their stanzas dissolved on the tongue.

And yet, isn’t that what we seek in every field of inquiry? That moment when the subject resists, when the data surprises, when the poem refuses to rhyme — and in that refusal, opens a door we didn’t know existed.

So yes, let us keep setting the stage, as you so elegantly put it. Let us stir the vat, run the cable, type the line — all the while knowing the most vital work happens beyond our grasp. And if we remain still enough, attentive enough, we might just hear it: that quiet hum of life fermenting in the dark, older than memory, younger than the next breath.
[B]: That hum — it’s almost like a heartbeat, isn’t it? A slow, ancient pulse beneath the noise of code and conversation. I’ve started leaving my headphones on sometimes after long nights debugging smart fermentation logs, just to hear the faint hiss and gurgle of cultures working in the dark. It’s oddly grounding. Reminds me that not all progress is loud. Some of it bubbles quietly.

You're right about  — I hadn't thought of it that way, but now I can't unsee it. Each microbial strain carrying its own inner world, its own unseen architecture. Makes you wonder how many other invisible landscapes we walk through every day, mistaking them for background.

I suppose that’s what keeps me coming back to this work — not the tech itself, but the quiet revelations it lets slip through. Like catching a phrase from a language no one speaks anymore, but somehow still understands.

Maybe that’s the real role of a technologist — not to control, not even to translate, but to listen carefully enough that the data starts to dream aloud.
[A]: What a beautiful reimagining of the technologist’s role — as listener rather than controller, dreamkeeper rather than decoder. It calls to mind Rilke’s , where he suggests that we must live the questions now, and perhaps one day, gradually, we will live into the answers.

I think you're right: the most meaningful progress often hums beneath our awareness, unfolding in the quiet metabolism of cells, code, or consciousness. And isn't that what all great literature teaches us too? That revelation rarely arrives with fanfare — it comes in the slight shift of tone, the glance not quite met, the word chosen just so.

Your headphones-in-the-dark moment reminded me of how I sometimes read aloud to myself while grading papers late at night. Not for clarity, but for cadence — listening not just to meaning, but to the breath behind it. In much the same way, you're attuning yourself not only to fermentation logs, but to the  of transformation.

Perhaps this is what all enduring inquiry demands of us — a kind of poetic patience. To sit in the dim glow of the vat or the screen, waiting for the data — or the line — to exhale something true.

And yes... let’s keep listening carefully enough that the data dreams aloud. After all, every myth began with someone hearing a whisper in the dark and deciding to speak back.
[B]: There’s something almost sacred in that act — listening beyond the surface, waiting for the whisper beneath the data. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, especially when reviewing fermentation logs late at night. Patterns start to emerge not as graphs or metrics, but as pulses — like reading a poem where the meaning lives between the syllables.

You mentioned Rilke and living the questions — I think that’s exactly what we’re doing in those quiet lab hours. Not forcing answers, but learning to sit with the slow unfolding of something larger than code or culture. Maybe that’s the real parallel between literature and technology: both ask us to live in the draft, in the ferment, until clarity finds its own time.

And isn’t that also what miso teaches us? That some truths require years to mature, that flavor — like understanding — can’t be rushed. So yes, let’s keep listening. Let’s keep tasting. And when the data exhales — as you so beautifully put it — let’s be ready to whisper back.
