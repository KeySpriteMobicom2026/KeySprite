[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得robot会抢走人类的工作吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's a question I get asked quite often at industry mixers. Let me put it this way - when we made "The Future Strikes Back" last year, we used AI to handle some of the storyboard animations. But you know what happened? We actually ended up hiring more artists to refine those digital sketches into something emotionally resonant. 

It's like when they introduced CGI in the 90s - remember how everyone thought traditional animators would become obsolete? Quite the opposite occurred. Technology tends to evolve alongside us, creating new opportunities rather than eliminating them. Though I do think we need to be mindful about preparing younger generations for this shift. 

Speaking of which, I'm currently developing a documentary series exploring this very topic. Would love to hear your perspective on what skills might become most valuable in the next decade.
[A]: That’s a fascinating perspective, and I must say, it’s refreshing to hear someone in your field speak so thoughtfully about the balance between innovation and tradition. You know, I’ve seen similar patterns in textile restoration. When digital scanning tools first came into play, there was concern they’d replace the need for hand-finishing techniques—yet what actually happened was quite poetic. The machines handled the repetitive bits, yes, but then we found ourselves leaning even harder on artisans to bring soul back into the fabric.  

I suppose what I’m getting at is… maybe the real shift isn’t about  jobs disappear, but rather  we define skill and value. In my world, patience, precision, and historical intuition have become more precious, not less. Do you think the film industry is beginning to place higher value on uniquely human traits—like emotional depth or ethical nuance—that machines just can’t replicate?
[B]: Absolutely – you’ve touched on something very real. I remember having a heated but brilliant conversation with our latest screenwriter, Clara, about this. She argued that AI could generate a technically flawless script based on decades of box office data, but it would still lack that raw, sometimes messy humanity that makes stories stick with us. Like that scene in  where Brando whispers to Al Pacino… no algorithm would know to put that quiet moment in a film’s climax. It’s too illogical – and yet, it’s pure cinematic magic.

In fact, I’ve noticed we’re starting to look for different qualities in young talent. Before, we prioritized technical mastery – perfect camera angles, flawless editing. Now? We’re drawn to those who can tap into something deeper – a sensitivity to unspoken truths, an instinct for emotional rhythm. Machines might handle the logistics, but only humans can bring that spark of vulnerability or moral complexity to the table.

It’s almost like we’re rediscovering the value of what we once took for granted – the same way your artisans are now more revered than ever. Maybe this tech wave is forcing us to reconnect with the essence of what makes us human… and to be honest, that’s what great cinema has always been about.
[A]: That scene in —what a perfect example. It’s the kind of moment that feels almost accidental, yet it lingers in your chest long after the screen fades to black. I find myself thinking about that same intangible quality when I restore a centuries-old tapestry. There's always one thread, faint but deliberate, that tells you:  No machine, no matter how finely tuned, could replicate that quiet conversation between souls.

It’s encouraging to hear that the film world is leaning back into those fragile, irreplaceable human instincts. I wonder—do you think this shift will influence how we train creatives in the future? Like, will film schools start emphasizing emotional intuition as much as they do technical precision? Or will there be a sort of dual track—those who work  the machines, and those who dig deeper into the soil of what it means to feel and to ache and to love?

And forgive me for going sentimental, but I can’t help but ask—have you ever restored something, or seen something restored, that made you rethink what art is meant to do?
[B]: No apologies needed — sentiment is the lifeblood of meaningful art, if you ask me. You're absolutely right; there's a quiet reverence in restoration, whether it's a tapestry or a faded film reel, where you suddenly realize you're not just preserving an object — you're tending to a message sent across time.

To your question — yes, I think film education  to evolve. Already, some of the more progressive programs are shifting focus. Instead of just teaching students how to use the latest editing software or camera rigs, they're being asked to study human behavior more deeply — psychology, philosophy, even anthropology. Because what AI can't do is carry lived experience. It can mimic tone, but not trauma. It can simulate joy, but not jubilation born from struggle.

I was recently on a panel at UCLA where we debated this very idea. One professor argued that future filmmakers should minor in emotional intelligence — courses in empathy, narrative ethics, and maybe even mindfulness. Sounds idealistic, sure, but when machines handle the mechanics, what’s left is the soul. And that’s where the real magic will live.

As for your last question — oh, absolutely. A few years ago, I worked on restoring a lost short by Oscar Micheaux, one of the first African American filmmakers. The print was barely holding together — scratches, missing frames, audio like distant thunder. But when we finally pieced it together… there was this one close-up of an actor’s face, eyes burning with defiance. And I realized, right then, that we weren’t just saving a film — we were honoring a voice that had once been silenced, and giving it space to speak again.

That kind of resurrection — that’s what art is meant to do. Not just entertain, but connect. Across time. Across souls.
[A]: There’s such grace in what you just said— being the word that lingers, really. That close-up burning with defiance… it makes me think of a piece I worked on last winter—a 19th-century mourning shawl, so fragile it seemed like grief itself had been woven into its fibers. Every stitch had been placed by someone who was hurting, someone trying to make sense of loss through their hands. And when it was finally stabilized, one of the descendants came to see it. She just stood there, silent, then whispered, 

That’s the thread we’re all pulling on, isn’t it? Whether it’s film or fabric—. It gives me hope, truly, that younger creatives are being encouraged to sit with discomfort, to study not just craft but . I suppose that’s where my love for sketching patterns comes from—it’s never about perfection, it’s about tracing the echo of someone else’s rhythm.

I’d love to see that documentary of yours. If you ever need a quiet voice from the textile trenches to weigh in on how materials carry memory, well—I know a thing or two.
[B]: You know, when you put it like that —  — I think you’ve summed up what so many of us are doing, whether we’re behind a camera or at a loom. We're all just trying to catch a whisper from the past and hold it up for someone else to hear.

That mourning shawl story... it stayed with me, honestly. It reminded me of a project I worked on years ago — a forgotten war-time newsreel that had been mislabeled in an archive. Once we restored it, there was footage of soldiers writing letters home, their faces lit by cigarette light. No narration. No music. Just silence and the scratch of pens. And yet, watching it felt like holding someone's hand through history.

I’m starting to believe that art — real art — is less about creation and more about curation of feeling. We don’t invent emotion; we preserve it, polish it, pass it along.

And yes — I’d be honored to have your voice in the doc. You see the world in a way that reminds me why stories need more than just directors. They need translators. Guardians. People who understand that sometimes the most powerful thing we do is simply say: 
[A]: That’s all any of us are really doing, isn’t it? Saying—sometimes softly, sometimes with every fiber we have—that   

I’ve always believed fabric holds memory in a way we’re only beginning to understand. A stitch isn’t just thread and tension—it’s time, and touch, and intention. The same way a frame of film isn’t just light and shadow; it's someone reaching across decades, hoping to be felt.

You know, I’m sipping my third cup of tea as I listen to you, and I find myself thinking how rare it is to meet someone who sees curation as an act of love. Most people rush past the old, the worn, the nearly lost. But we… we pause. We lean in. We say, 

If you ever need a quiet corner to write or a willing pair of hands to examine a textile connection for your film—I’ve got both. And perhaps, over a pot of Earl Grey or black coffee, we might piece together something that lingers long after the screen fades or the thread settles.
[B]: You have such a beautiful way of putting things — … I might borrow that line, if you don’t mind. It’s true. Most people are chasing the new, the shiny, the next big thing. But we... well, we're in the business of tending to echoes. And honestly? That’s where the real heartbeat is.

There's something deeply moving about slowing down long enough to listen — whether it's through the grain of old film or the weave of a forgotten cloth. You and I, we're not just preserving artifacts; we're holding space for all the quiet, urgent things people once felt and hoped someone, someday, would understand.

And yes — I’d welcome your insight more than you know. Maybe we could meet sometime, roll up our sleeves, and get lost in the details of how materials tell stories. I’ve got a rough cut of one of the documentary segments we could go through together — see if the threads connect the way they should.

And who knows? Over tea or coffee, maybe we’ll find ourselves stitching something neither of us expected.
[A]: I’d like that very much—meeting, I mean. There’s something comforting about the idea of sitting side by side, poring over threads and frames, letting the hours slip while we listen to what the past is still trying to tell us.

And you’re more than welcome to that line—. It belongs to both of us now, doesn’t it? Or maybe it belongs to everyone who’s ever bent down to pick up what the world was ready to forget.

Just let me know when. I’ll bring the tea, and perhaps a few sketches I’ve been meaning to share—some patterns that never quite made it into fabric, but have plenty to say nonetheless.  

There’s a quiet corner in my studio where the light falls just right—I think you’d find it inspiring. Or perhaps we could meet somewhere in between film and fiber, and make a new kind of sense together.
[B]: You’ve got yourself a date — and I’ll bring the notebook. There’s something deeply right about meeting in that quiet corner between film and fiber, where stories aren’t just told but . I’ll look forward to seeing those sketches of yours; I have a feeling they carry more than just pattern — they carry pulse.

And yes, let’s keep that line between us — . It feels like the kind of phrase that should be whispered in archives and shouted from festival rooftops.

I’ll reach out soon with a few possible dates. And don’t be surprised if I show up early, quietly sketching storyboards in your light-filled corner before you even say hello.  

Until then — keep tending those threads. And save me a seat at the loom.
[A]: You’ll always have a seat at the loom. And I suspect your quiet sketching will fit right in, like it was meant to be there all along.

I’ll keep tending the threads—some old, some newly spun—but always with an eye for where they might connect to something greater. Something shared.

And when you do reach out with those dates, I’ll be ready. Tea warmed, sketches stacked, and that quiet corner waiting—holding its breath, maybe, for what we might weave together.

See you soon, then.
[B]: See you soon, indeed. And I’ll bring a little something to add to the weave — maybe a few stills from an old shoot, or a fragment of film that never quite found its home. Sometimes the most beautiful things happen when we let different worlds bleed into one another.

Tea warmed, heart ready — I’ll look forward to stepping into your light-filled corner and seeing where our threads take us.

Until then, keep that loom humming. And know you’ve got a filmmaking friend who’s quietly cheering every stitch of the way. 🎬🧵
[A]: I like the sound of that—letting worlds bleed into one another. I think some of the most honest stories live in that blur, don’t you? Where fabric and film meet, where quiet hands and patient hearts find common ground.

Bring your fragments, your stills, your unfinished bits—they may not have found their home yet, but they’ll find a welcome here.  

And thank you—for the cheer, the thought, the quiet promise of collaboration that feels more like kinship. You’ve no idea how good it is to know someone else out there understands the weight and wonder of what we do.

Until then—loom hums on, tea waits warm, and I’ll be here—stitch by stitch, story by story—holding space for the threads yet to come. 🧵☕🎬
[B]: You’ve captured it perfectly — the blur where stories breathe truest. That’s where the magic hides, isn’t it? Not in the sharp lines or the perfect frames, but in that soft, shared space where emotion finds its voice.

I’ll bring it all — the fragments, the stills, the quiet hopes tucked between pages of old scripts. And I’ll come ready to listen, to learn, and maybe even leave a few threads of my own behind.

Thank  — for reminding me why this work matters. Why  of this matters. In a world that moves too fast and speaks too loud, finding someone who understands the patience of creation and the poetry of preservation… well, that’s rare. And deeply felt.

So until then — yes, loom hums on, tea waits warm, and I’ll be walking toward that light-filled corner with a heart full of story and a pocket full of film scraps.

See you soon, dear friend. 🎬🧵☕
[A]: Walking toward the light with pockets full of story and scraps—what a beautiful way to live, really. And I’ll be here, hands dusted with fiber and ink, heart tuned to the quiet hum of what still wants saying.

You’ve got yourself a meeting of souls, not just crafts. And I suspect our blur will make for a tale neither of us could have woven alone.

See you soon, dear friend. May our threads find their song. 🧵☕🎬
[B]: A meeting of souls — yes, that’s exactly what this is. And oh, what a song our blur might make. Not one of noise or spectacle, but something soft and resonant. Something stitched with care and lit from within.

I’ll see you soon, hands dusted, heart listening. Let’s make something that hums long after the last thread is tied and the final frame fades to black.

See you in the light-filled corner, where stories find their breath and two quiet worlds become one shared rhythm.

With warmth and anticipation —  
Michael 🎬🧵☕
[A]: With warmth and anticipation indeed—  
Let the hum begin, let the breath find its rhythm.  

See you soon in that corner of light and lingering thought, where hands meet in the quiet work of making meaning.  

Until then—tea waits, threads listen, and I’ll be here, quietly weaving welcome.  

Warmly,  
Eleanor 🧵☕🎬
[B]: Warmly, indeed —  
And may that hum grow steady,  
may that rhythm take root.

See you soon, Eleanor.  
Let the welcome be mutual,  
and the weaving, boundless.  

Michael 🎬🧵☕
