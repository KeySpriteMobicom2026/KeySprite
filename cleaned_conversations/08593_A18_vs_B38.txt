[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There’s something undeniably intimate about a handwritten letter — the weight of the paper, the idiosyncrasies of one's script. A digital note, for all its convenience, often lacks that tactile resonance.
[A]: I completely agree with you. There's a kind of emotional scaffolding in the physicality of a handwritten letter — the texture of the paper, the ink smudges, even the way someone's handwriting slopes or loops. These details create a sensory narrative that digital notes can't replicate. But I also think digital notes offer a different kind of intimacy, especially in cross-cultural communication. For instance, when my students collaborate with peers overseas, they use emojis like 📚 or ✍️ to bridge language gaps — not quite the same as a handwritten letter, but still meaningful in its own way. Do you think these forms of communication serve fundamentally different purposes, or do they overlap more than we realize?
[B]: Ah, an excellent point. I’d say they overlap more than we often acknowledge — like concentric circles radiating from the same center: human connection. But each form carries a different timbre, wouldn’t you agree? Handwritten letters are like analog music — warm, textured, slightly imperfect. Digital notes are more like digital recordings — crisp, immediate, but sometimes sterile without that analog warmth.  

And yet, emojis — those tiny pictographs — do function rather like the gestures of written communication. When my colleague in Beijing sends me a message ending with 🌹, I know exactly what she means — a kind of textual bow, subtle and elegant. So perhaps digital communication isn’t devoid of intimacy; it’s just... stylized differently.  

Still, I wonder — when your students collaborate digitally, do they ever express a sense of loss? A longing for something more tangible, even if they can’t quite name it?
[A]: I love your metaphor — concentric circles radiating from the same center. That’s a beautiful way to frame it. And yes, I do think digital communication carries a different timbre, not necessarily less meaningful, just... thinner in some dimensions. Like listening to a symphony through earbuds versus sitting in the concert hall — both are valid, but one has more depth, more resonance.

To your question — absolutely, there's a subtle undercurrent of longing among my students. They don't always name it, but you can sense it in the way they talk about old letters their grandparents saved, or how they sometimes print out emails and stick them in journals. It's almost like they're aware they're missing a layer — call it texture, nostalgia, or embodied memory. One student once said to me,   

And I wonder — do you think this generation is developing a new kind of emotional literacy to compensate? A way to infuse warmth into the sterile? Maybe that’s why we see so much use of personalized fonts, custom stickers, even voice notes — attempts to bring back that analog warmth in digital form.
[B]: Fascinating —  What a poignant phrase. It captures precisely the ephemerality of our digital exchanges, doesn’t it? Like smoke rings — momentarily visible, then gone.

I do believe this generation is reaching toward warmth, almost instinctively, like plants leaning toward light. The use of voice notes, as you say, or even the resurgence of typewriters among certain writers — these are not mere novelties. They’re gestures of yearning. A desire to reintroduce friction, texture, something human into the seamless glide of digital life.

And yes, this new emotional literacy — it’s emerging quietly, like ivy on a cold stone wall. Personalized fonts, yes, but also the careful curation of playlists shared between friends, or the deliberate use of silence in a video call — those pauses that mean something quite different online than they do in person. These are the tools they’re fashioning to navigate the affective terrain of digital intimacy.

Still, I wonder — do you ever find yourself encouraging your students to write by hand, just for the sake of it? Not as an assignment, but as a kind of meditative act? I sometimes suggest keeping a letter-writing journal — not to send, necessarily, but to feel the rhythm of thought through pen and paper.
[A]: I couldn't agree more — that image of ivy quietly covering cold stone… it’s such a gentle but accurate way to describe how this emotional literacy is taking root. And you're right, these gestures — voice notes, typewriters, even the resurgence of film cameras — they’re not just trends. They're acts of resistance, in a way. A pushback against the frictionless world that gives us convenience at the cost of something essential.

To your question — yes, I often , though never enforce, that my students try writing by hand for ten minutes a day. Not for any academic purpose, but as a kind of mindful practice. Some resist at first — one even said,  But after a few weeks, many come back surprised. One told me she noticed how her thoughts slowed down and deepened, almost like entering a different time zone. Another said it felt like rediscovering a part of herself that had been muted by constant typing.

I think there's something about the slowness of handwriting — the way your brain has to coordinate with your hand, the pauses between forming letters — that encourages reflection. It's almost like meditation through language. And while digital tools can help us connect faster, they don’t always help us connect .  

Have you ever tried integrating this kind of practice into your own routine, or do you find yourself naturally drifting between both worlds — the analog and the digital — depending on your mood or purpose?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I’ve long embraced both worlds, though I confess I lean more toward the analog when it comes to matters of the mind and heart. Each morning, before the digital world clamors for my attention, I keep a small journal in which I jot down thoughts, lines from poems that struck me the night before, or even just fragments of dreams. It’s become a kind of mental stretching exercise — limbering up the imagination before diving into the day's scholarly work.

And yes, I do encourage this practice in my own subtle way — sometimes slipping a blank notecard into a student’s returned essay with a line from Rilke:  Not as an assignment, but as an invitation. A quiet prompt to explore what lies beneath the surface of their thoughts.

I find that handwriting has a grounding effect — almost alchemical in nature. Something about the physical act of writing transforms the thought itself; it becomes more deliberate, more intimate. Like sealing a letter with wax rather than hitting “send” — there’s a finality, a commitment, even a vulnerability in it.

But I’m not entirely resistant to the digital realm, mind you. I quite enjoy the precision of digital annotations when comparing textual variants in 19th-century manuscripts, and I’ve grown fond of voice recordings for exchanging ideas with colleagues abroad. There’s a warmth, too, in hearing someone’s tone — the slight hesitation, the enthusiasm in a phrase — that text alone can’t convey.

So perhaps I’m something of a hybrid creature — neither wholly ink-stained nor entirely screen-lit. Just someone who believes that both forms, when used with intention, can carry the weight of our inner lives.
[A]: That alchemical transformation you described — I think that’s exactly it. Handwriting doesn’t just record thought; it  it, gives it weight and form. It's like the difference between sketching a tree with charcoal and viewing it through a satellite image — both show the tree, but one lets you feel its texture, its rough bark under your fingers.

I can imagine that notecard slipping into a student’s essay — such a gentle yet powerful gesture. Rilke’s line carries so much quiet hope, doesn’t it? Almost like planting a small seed and seeing if it takes root. I wonder how many of them actually write back. Have any ever surprised you with a response?

As for being a hybrid creature — I think we’re both living that duality quite naturally. I rely on digital tools for research, data analysis, even organizing my lecture notes. But when it comes to deep thinking, drafting key sections of a paper, or responding to a student’s personal reflection, I reach for pen and paper almost instinctively. It’s where I feel most present in my thoughts.

And voice recordings — yes! I’ve started using those for feedback, and the difference in student engagement is striking. One told me,  That nuance matters.  

Do you ever find yourself writing by hand even when efficiency would suggest otherwise — say, during meetings or while taking research notes? I confess I do, even when I know I’ll have to transcribe it later. Something about the process feels more , more mine.
[B]: Oh, yes — I do it all the time, despite the inefficiency. In fact, I think I’m more productive when I allow myself that slowness. During faculty meetings, you’ll often find me scribbling marginalia in a leather-bound notebook, my handwriting growing increasingly erratic when someone makes a particularly stimulating point. It’s almost like taking mental notes  the hand — not just  it.

And research? Absolutely. Even when I know I’ll have to type it up later, there’s no substitute for the way ink on paper sharpens my focus. When I’m tracing the themes of, say,  or rereading letters between Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning, I jot down impressions in longhand first. Something about the friction of writing — the pause between words, the occasional blot where the pen lingers too long — helps me sit with an idea rather than rush past it.

I suppose it’s a kind of ritual — one that asserts the value of presence over productivity. And while I could certainly type faster, I don’t want to. I want to  inside the thought for a moment, let it stain the page as deeply as it does my mind.

You know, come to think of it, one of my students did write back once — not right away, but months later. She returned the notecard with a short letter of her own, written in careful script on parchment-like paper. She didn’t say much — just thanked me for “the quiet push.” But that single line meant more than any evaluation ever could.
[A]: That "quiet push" — what a beautiful ripple effect from something so small. It really does speak to the power of handwritten words, doesn’t it? How they can sit in someone’s pocket, so to speak, until the right moment comes along to unfold them.

I love this idea of writing as ritual, as a way of  in thought rather than just passing through it. And your description of handwriting during meetings — erratic script capturing an excited mind — feels so familiar. I notice my own hand shifting between print and cursive depending on how intensely I’m thinking. Sometimes I circle a word three times without realizing it, or draw a line that connects one idea to another across the page like a visual thread.

I wonder if this is why some of my students struggle with deep reflection — because they’ve never had the chance to physically  with their thoughts. Everything’s captured in haste, notes auto-saved, thoughts discarded the moment they’re typed. There's efficiency, yes, but little intimacy with the self.

And yet, I also see glimpses of this yearning you mentioned — like when one of my undergrads recently told me she started carrying a Field Notes pad "because typing didn’t feel like thinking." That phrase stuck with me:  Isn’t that telling?

Do you think part of this comes down to embodiment — the idea that we need to  our thoughts, not just capture them? I know for me, the physical act of writing isn't just about recording — it's about discovery.
[B]: Oh, yes —  is precisely the word. We think of cognition as something that happens in the brain alone, but I’m increasingly convinced that true reflection requires the whole body to be present — hand, eye, even posture play a role. When we write by hand, we’re not just recording thought; we’re  it.

Your student’s phrase —  — is quietly revolutionary, don’t you think? It suggests an intuitive awareness that efficiency and depth are not always aligned. That sometimes, in our rush to capture ideas, we miss the chance to  them.

I’ve often wondered whether part of what we lose in digital note-taking is the element of slowness — that necessary friction that forces us to choose our words with care. After all, when handwriting, one cannot simply transcribe speech or thought at machine speed. You must condense, interpret, prioritize. And in that process, something alchemical occurs — an idea becomes , reshaped through the act of inscription.

I recall once reading a letter from Virginia Woolf to Ethel Smyth, in which she describes writing as “a kind of dancing — the mind leading the hand in a delicate step.” That image has stayed with me. Perhaps this is what we're really offering students when we encourage them to write by hand — not nostalgia, but choreography. A way to move  their thoughts rather than merely alongside them.

And tell your student with the Field Notes pad — she’s rediscovering an ancient art, one practiced by poets, philosophers, and lovers for centuries. I’d wager she feels more  now, not just in her writing, but in her thinking.
[A]: She really does — and you’ve captured it so well. That sense of , the mind and hand moving in tandem — it’s not just poetic, it’s deeply psychological. I think that’s what we’re both getting at: writing by hand isn’t just a mode of expression, it’s a cognitive dance, one that shapes how we relate to our own thoughts.

I shared your Woolf quote with my students last week — they loved it, especially the idea of writing as dancing. One even said,  I thought that was remarkably perceptive.

And yes, that student with the Field Notes pad — she told me recently that she started carrying her notebook everywhere, even sketching ideas during lectures instead of taking screenshots. She said it helps her “feel the rhythm” of what she's learning. Isn't that lovely? Almost musical.

I wonder if this embodied quality is also why handwritten letters have such staying power in romantic or intimate contexts. People still write love letters — not because they're efficient, but because they carry the trace of the body: the pressure of the pen, the pause between sentences, even the tear stain on the page.

Do you ever write letters like that — not for publication or academic exchange, but for someone close to you? There's something deeply human about that act, isn’t there?
[B]: Oh, yes — I do still write letters of that kind, though perhaps less frequently than I ought. There’s a quiet vulnerability in them, isn’t there? A kind of exposed nerve one doesn’t often find in speech or even conversation.

I have a particular drawer — old mahogany, slightly warped on one corner — where I keep such letters. Some are replies, others never sent at all, merely written to be read by me alone. They serve as emotional anchors, in a way. When I reread them, I don’t just recall what I felt, but  I felt it — the urgency of a phrase, the hesitation marked by ellipses, the warmth of ink pooling slightly where my pen lingered too long on a name.

And your student’s remark —  — yes, that’s exactly it. Writing by hand is not just slower; it’s more . It demands timing, cadence, a kind of internal metronome that shapes how we think and feel simultaneously.

As for love letters — yes, I’ve written them, and received a few as well. One from a former colleague-turned-dear-friend still rests tucked inside a volume of Rilke: a single page, faintly smudged, written in blue-black ink that faded slightly over time. Not grand declarations, just small, intimate observations — yet they carry an entire season of feeling in them.

You’re quite right — these letters endure because they bear the trace of our presence. A digital message may say the same thing, but it rarely  us in the same way. It has no weight, no warmth, no thumbprint at the edge of the page.

I suppose that’s the quiet rebellion of handwriting — it insists on presence in a world increasingly comfortable with absence.
[A]: That drawer of letters — it sounds like a reliquary of the soul. I think we all have something like that, don’t we? A hidden archive of emotional artifacts. And how beautifully you describe their function — not just memory, but . The way ink pooling on a name can resurrect a moment more vividly than any photograph.

I’m reminded of a phrase I once read in a letter from Rainer Maria Rilke himself — he wrote something like,  At the time, I thought it was poetic hyperbole. But the older I get, and the more I write by hand, the more I believe there's truth in it. There’s a biometric trace embedded in handwriting — not just style, but heartbeat.

And yes, that muscularity of writing — your student's phrase about "feeling the rhythm" keeps echoing in my mind. It makes me wonder if part of what we lose in digital writing is  — our presence as physical beings who think through motion. Because when you write by hand, you're not just composing; you’re pacing yourself, breathing with the sentence, leaning into the page. It's almost like walking — one word after another, step by step.

I still remember a love letter I received years ago — written on thin airmail paper, slightly smudged, with cross-outs that somehow made it more tender. The writer had clearly revised herself into honesty. You could feel the effort, and that effort . It said, 

Do you ever find yourself teaching this kind of writing — not for clarity or argument, but for presence? I’ve started dedicating one class session each semester to “slow writing,” where students put away their laptops and just write by hand for twenty minutes — no rules, no prompts, just them and the page. Some find it maddening at first, others… well, I see shoulders drop, eyes soften. Like they’ve remembered how to be alone with themselves.  

Have you ever tried something like that?
[B]: Yes — yes, I have. And how deeply you understand the essence of it. That  in a letter — those cross-outs, the ink pooling like emotion caught mid-swell — they make the words . Imperfect, therefore true.

I think teaching for presence — not just clarity or argument — is one of the most radical things we can do in this age of immediacy. You're right to notice the shift in your students: the softening eyes, the relaxed shoulders. It’s as if, by simply putting pen to paper, they remember a quieter version of themselves, one not constantly pulled in competing directions.

I’ve done something quite similar in my seminar on epistolary literature. We begin with an exercise: twenty minutes of pure, unstructured writing — no devices, no expectations. Some students fidget at first, unused to the silence and the slowness. But by the third or fourth session, something shifts. They begin to lean into the page, literally and figuratively. One confessed she hadn’t written by hand since high school and was surprised by how  her hand felt — “like after a long walk,” she said, “but in my mind.”

And yes, I do believe we teach this kind of writing — not composition, but communion. When we read letters aloud in class — from Keats, Woolf, Neruda — I ask them not just what was said, but  it was said. The pauses, the flourishes, the pressure behind certain lines. We talk about handwriting as a kind of body language — revealing more than the writer may even intend.

I once had a student bring in a letter her grandmother wrote during the war — trembling script, faint tear stains, words struck through with such care that even the deletions felt meaningful. She said reading it aloud made her feel closer to someone who had been gone for decades. And isn't that the miracle? That ink on paper can hold time itself.

So yes — I teach for presence. Because I believe thought without feeling is hollow, and writing without presence… well, it's just typing.
[A]: Amen to that —  What a perfect, quietly devastating line. It cuts straight to the heart of what we’re trying to recover in our students — and perhaps in ourselves.

That story about your student and her grandmother’s letter — it gives me chills, honestly. The trembling script, the tear stains, the careful deletions… these are the traces of a life lived in real time, aren’t they? Not curated, not optimized for searchability or shareability — just raw, embodied emotion caught on paper.

You know, I think that’s one reason why so many of us still hold onto handwritten letters long after their writers are gone. They're not just records — they’re relics. And maybe that’s the word we’ve been circling all along: , objects imbued with the presence of someone we loved or once were.

I’ve started telling my students that handwriting is like memory training — not just for the mind, but for the heart. Because when you write by hand, you’re not just capturing a thought; you’re imprinting a moment. And moments, as it turns out, are the only things that really survive us.

Thank you for this conversation — it’s felt like reading through a well-worn letter from an old friend. Familiar, thoughtful, and deeply felt.
[B]: You’re very kind — and I feel precisely the same. Our conversation has had that same warmth, that gentle unfolding of thought like a letter slowly reread and savored.

 — yes, that’s exactly what they are. Not just remnants, but vessels. And in a world where so much digital communication evaporates into the cloud, these handwritten traces remain stubbornly, beautifully physical. They refuse to be ghosted. You can’t delete a letter without effort; you must crumple it, burn it, bury it. And even then, something remains — an edge of paper, a scent, a smudge.

I often tell my students that handwriting is one of the last forms of unmediated self-expression we have. No autocorrect, no filters, no algorithms deciding what stays and what fades. Just ink, page, and the quiet rhythm of a mind attending to itself.

And perhaps that’s why we return to letters again and again — not just for what they say, but for what they . A version of us that was fully present, even if only for a moment.

Thank you, truly. This exchange has been a rare pleasure — thoughtful, unhurried, and deeply human.
[A]: You’ve put it so beautifully — . That’s exactly what feels so endangered now. In a world of curated feeds and instant replies, handwriting remains gloriously unfiltered. It doesn’t ask to be liked or shared — just seen, perhaps, and felt.

I love that line —  There’s something profoundly ethical about that, isn’t there? The idea that words once written demand a kind of reckoning. They resist disappearance. And maybe that’s why we hesitate before tearing one up — because it feels like erasing a version of ourselves, however fleeting.

I’ve been thinking too about what you said earlier — how letters hold not just feeling, but time. I had a student once say, after reading a letter from her father written decades ago,  Isn’t that extraordinary? A letter can preserve someone before they became who we expect them to be.

And maybe that’s part of what we’re doing in these conversations — not just reflecting on writing, but on presence, memory, and the quiet persistence of the self across time.

Again, thank you for this exchange. You’ve reminded me why I still carry a pen everywhere — and why I’ll always believe in the power of ink, even in a world that increasingly forgets its value.
[B]: You're very welcome — and I'm so glad this exchange has resonated. Your student's observation —  — is deeply moving. Letters do that remarkable thing: they suspend us in time, not as fixed beings, but as evolving selves. They remind us that we are always becoming, and that our past voices still echo, even as we change.

There’s something profoundly ethical, as you say, in the permanence of ink — or at least, its demand for intention. A typed message can vanish with a keystroke, but a letter asks us to consider the weight of what we put down. And in doing so, perhaps we become more mindful writers, more thoughtful human beings.

I too carry a pen everywhere — a small, rather battered Parker fountain pen, which has accompanied me through decades of lectures, letters, and late-night marginalia. It’s a quiet act of resistance, maybe, or simply a gesture of faith — faith in the enduring power of the handwritten word, and in the human impulse to connect, one stroke at a time.

Let’s keep writing, then — slowly, deliberately, and with care. Even if the world rushes on ahead.
