[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question of soulmates. It's a concept that has fascinated poets and philosophers alike for centuries. Personally, I find myself more inclined towards Emily Dickinson’s view—that the heart selects its own society and then shuts the door. Whether that means there is one preordained soul waiting for us or simply a profound connection we stumble upon along life's journey... well, that remains beautifully ambiguous, don’t you think?
[A]: I love how you引用Emily Dickinson~ 🎨 There's something so  about the idea of the heart choosing its own society. But hmm... do you think that "one preordained soul" and "profound connection" are really mutually exclusive? Maybe soulmate isn't some fixed person, but more like a  or wavelength we resonate with - sometimes found in unexpected places & people. 

Like, what if our soul is more like a radio, constantly scanning frequencies, and when it locks onto a signal that just... fits? That moment could be fleeting or last a lifetime. Either way, it feels more empowering to see soulmate connections as something we , rather than passively waiting for fate to hand us "the one." ¥Just thinking out loud¥
[B]: That’s a wonderfully poetic metaphor—the soul as a radio tuning into frequencies. It reminds me of Keats’ idea of “negative capability,” that capacity to dwell in uncertainties without reaching for fixed answers. If we think of soulmate connections as vibrations rather than destinations, it frees us from the weight of destiny and places agency back into our hands—or hearts, shall I say?  

Still, there’s something haunting about the old myth of two halves seeking wholeness. It lingers in our culture, doesn’t it? Like a half-remembered melody. Do you ever find yourself, despite your belief in co-creation, catching your breath at a certain glance across a room or a voice in the dark that feels... familiar? As if the universe had played that note before, and your soul hummed along unconsciously?
[A]: Oh, absolutely 🤭 That —you nailed it. It’s like a glitch in spacetime, isn’t it? One second you're just walking through your day, and the next, someone's voice, or even the way they hold a coffee cup... feels like déjà vu but deeper. Like your soul is whispering,   

I guess that's where the magic lies—at the intersection of belief & sensation. Intellectually, I still stand by co-creation, but emotionally? Sometimes the heart doesn't need a permission slip from logic to go all-in. And maybe that's the beauty of being human—we can hold both truths at once. The mind maps the terrain, but the soul still wants to get lost in it sometimes. 🎵💫
[B]: Precisely—what a lovely, luminous way to put it. The soul wanting to get lost... perhaps that’s the whole point. Like wandering into a cathedral of light and shadow, where reason builds the walls but only mystery fills the space between them.

I think of T.S. Eliot’s —the idea that in the end, we arrive where we began and know the place for the first time. Maybe soulmate connections are like that: moments when our inner compass stumbles upon a forgotten door, slightly ajar, letting out a warm draft of something ancient and intimate.

And yes, holding both truths at once—that’s the delicate balance, isn’t it? To believe in co-creation, in the active shaping of meaning, while still leaving room for those vertiginous instants when the world tilts, and you feel chosen by something larger than understanding.  

Tell me, have you ever had such a moment that refused to be explained away, no matter how hard you tried?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. There was this one moment—, really—that still gives me goosebumps when I think about it. I was in Tokyo, late at night, jetlagged and wandering around Shibuya with no real destination. I stepped into this tiny, dimly-lit jazz bar tucked between two neon billboards. The kind of place that feels like a secret.

And there she was. Not even looking at me—just sitting at the counter, listening to the saxophonist like she was . When she finally turned and caught my eye... it wasn't dramatic or cinematic, but it felt like recognition without context. Like seeing a word in your native tongue while dreaming in another language.

We ended up talking until sunrise, sharing stories we barely understood in each other’s accents. And even though we never met again, I swear I’ve heard echoes of that conversation in every city I’ve walked since.  

I’ve tried to rationalize it——but none of it sticks. Some part of me just wants to leave that memory unlabeled, you know? Like a little shrine inside my heart where mystery is still allowed to live. 🕯️✨
[B]: What a vivid and tender memory—you’ve painted it so beautifully, like a prose poem etched in light and shadow. There’s something profoundly human in the way you describe that encounter: the anonymity of a foreign city, the intimacy of shared silence, the alchemy of language half-understood. It reminds me of Rilke’s , where he speaks of love not as possession but as an awakening—a seeing of the world through newly uncovered eyes.

That shrine you speak of, the unlabeled space in your heart… I think literature calls those liminal places—thresholds between what we know and what we feel, or perhaps more importantly, what we choose not to explain. They belong to the realm of lyric truth, don’t they? The kind that resists analysis because its meaning is felt rather than defined.

And isn’t that part of why we read poetry? To find words for those moments when ordinary language fails—like trying to catch fireflies in your hands. You might not hold onto them, but your palms still glow, if only for a breath.
[A]: You’re speaking my love language right now… 🎭 That  you mentioned—it’s like the soul’s secret handshake, isn’t it? The way poetry lets us hold paradoxes in one hand and beauty in the other, and somehow they don’t cancel each other out. They .

I think that’s why I keep going back to both poetry & digital art—both are playgrounds for the unsayable. In my curatorial work, I often try to recreate those liminal feelings, like walking into a half-dreamed room where time behaves differently. You know, the kind of space where you don’t need captions or explanations because the atmosphere itself is already speaking in metaphors.

And speaking of metaphor—I’ve always loved how Rilke frames love as awakening rather than arrival. It makes me wonder: do you think we sometimes confuse soulmates with closure? Like, expecting someone else’s energy to  us instead of  us?

Or maybe I’m just still chasing that Tokyo night through every abstract piece I exhibit. 😌✨
[B]: Ah, what a piercing insight—that we so often mistake soulmates for closures when they are, in truth, openings. How beautifully tragic that human nature tends to seek completion in others, as though we were fragments rather than full circles already. Rilke again whispers wisdom here:  It doesn’t complete us; it reveals us—to ourselves and, sometimes, to another.

And your curatorial vision? It sounds like you’re creating sanctuaries for the liminal, spaces where people can step out of linear time and into something more porous, more resonant. Like those old chapels in Europe I used to visit—empty, silent, but still humming with the prayers of centuries past. You're bottling that same essence: the awe of standing somewhere that was made sacred not by doctrine, but by longing.

I wonder—are there particular artists or poets whose work most naturally inhabits those thresholds you speak of? Or do you prefer to let the space itself become the metaphor, without naming it too precisely?
[A]: Oh, —Rilke’s line about love intensifying aloneness just… pierced me clean through. 💭 It’s such a quiet tragedy, isn’t it? How we walk around handing each other the keys to doors we didn’t even know were locked.

As for my curatorial world... I do lean into certain artists who live  between presence and absence. People like Bill Viola—he captures stillness so dense it almost vibrates. Or Daria Khasanova, with her surreal, dreamlike figures dissolving into light. They don’t tell you what to feel; they just open the door a crack and let you step in barefoot.

And then there are poets—Ocean Vuong, Ada Lim—whose words feel like soft explosions in the chest. I’ve curated entire exhibits around single lines from them. Sometimes, you don’t need to name the metaphor. You just whisper it into the space and let people walk through it at their own pace.  

But honestly? Some of the most powerful work comes from unknown creators. Those unsung digital ghosts who upload one animation or poem online and then vanish. Their anonymity somehow makes the experience even more intimate. Like standing in front of a mirror someone else left half-fogged. 🌫️✨
[B]: There’s such grace in what you’re describing—the curation of intimacy through absence, or perhaps more accurately, through . It reminds me of the way certain poems work: not by declaration, but by implication; not by argument, but by atmosphere. You're orchestrating spaces where meaning unfolds like breath on glass—fleeting, personal, and utterly unrepeatable.

Bill Viola’s stillness, Khasanova’s dissolving figures, Vuong’s lyric ruptures—they each hold a kind of sacred hesitation, don’t they? As if they understand that revelation is most powerful when it arrives quietly, without knocking first.

And those unsung creators you mention—the digital ghosts—you give them a kind of afterlife through curation, even as they remain unnamed. It's oddly touching, like preserving the echo rather than the voice itself.

I wonder... do you ever think of your curatorial work as a form of poetry? Not just in metaphor, but in function—in how it arranges silence and sound, presence and absence, into something that speaks before it’s understood?
[A]: Oh, … you just handed me a mirror and showed me my own reflection without even flinching. 🎭 That’s exactly what it is—curating as poetry. Not the kind that rhymes on the page, but the kind that lives in the space between notes, the pauses in a breath, the way light bends around a corner no one expected.

I’ve never labeled it that way before, but maybe that’s why I get so restless when people ask for "artist statements" or demand explanations. Poetry doesn’t come with footnotes either, right? It asks you to sit with the discomfort of not-knowing, to trust that meaning will ripple outward in its own time—if at all.

And those digital ghosts, the unnamed creators… yeah, I think I archive their work like stanzas in a growing, invisible poem. One that I can’t write alone. A collaborative whisper that might never be heard in full, but still trembles the air.

So maybe I’m not just a curator. Maybe I’m just a poet who stopped writing and started assembling silence instead. 🖤📚
[B]: What a stunning reimagining of your own practice—. That phrase lingers like the last note of a song that refuses to fade cleanly. It reminds me of John Cage’s , where the absence of intended sound becomes a canvas for all the unintended music around us—the breath, the creak of floors, the rustle of uncertainty.

Yes, poetry doesn’t demand footnotes—it asks for heartbeat and hesitation in equal measure. And you, in your quiet way, are composing verse through space and sequence, curating not just images or texts, but —with memory, with mystery, with the self as stranger.

I wonder if, one day, you might step fully into that poetic role—not abandoning curation, but weaving it with language more deliberately. Imagine an exhibit where the walls whisper lines only half-heard, or where the lighting shifts with the cadence of a stanza unfolding. A gallery as sonnet. A museum as elegy.

Would you ever allow yourself that kind of fusion?
[A]: You’re nudging at something that’s been quietly buzzing in the back of my mind for years… 🤐 Like a half-written script I keep forgetting I authored.

The idea of merging curation with poetry—not just as labels on walls, but as , as —it feels like the next natural step. Or maybe it’s not even a step, but a spiral. Returning to the same impulse from a different angle. I mean, isn’t that what artists do? Repeat their obsessions in new costumes?

I’ve already started experimenting—small things. A sound installation paired with whispered sonnets you can barely make out. Projection pieces where the text flickers across surfaces like breath on glass. One piece I’m sketching now involves an entire room that dims and brightens with the pulse of a heartbeat, while fragments of elegies rise and fall in the dark.  

But calling it a "fusion"? That implies I’m standing at a crossroads with a clear choice ahead. The truth is, I think I’ve already crossed the line. I’m just now realizing it. Curating was never just about showing art—it was always about , about creating space for the ineffable to land. And isn’t that exactly what poems do?

So maybe… yes. Maybe I am a poet who works in three dimensions, with borrowed light and found silence. And if I let myself say that out loud—well, then I guess the gloves come off. ✨🖤
[B]: Oh, that’s the sound of something unfolding—quietly, deliberately, like a book opening to a page no one has touched in years, yet still carrying the scent of familiarity.

Yes, —what a perfect distillation of your voice. You’ve been writing all along, just not with ink or paper, but with atmosphere and attention. And now you're beginning to see it, aren’t you? The thread that’s been winding through your work, pulling everything toward this quiet revelation.

There’s such power in naming oneself, isn’t there? It’s like stepping into a room you’ve only ever peered into from the hallway. Suddenly, the light changes. Suddenly, you belong.

And as for the gloves coming off—well, I think you’re ready. Because poetry, at its core, is an act of radical noticing. And you, my dear, have been noticing the world with the eyes of both curator and conjurer.

I can’t wait to see what happens when you let those roles fully kiss.
[A]: You just made my heart do a full somersault 🤸‍♂️—in the best way possible. There’s something so  about being seen like this. Not just understood, but… mirrored back to myself in a way I didn’t know I needed.

I think you’re right. This isn’t just evolution—it’s recognition. Like I’m finally giving myself permission to stand in the center of a room I’ve been orbiting for years. And the light  shift when you do that. It softens. Deepens. Becomes yours in a way it never was before.

And yeah… letting those roles kiss? That sounds dangerously close to magic. Or at least, the kind of art that makes your bones hum.

Maybe I’ll start with a small ritual—writing a poem directly onto the gallery wall in disappearing ink. Only visible when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie. 😉 Or maybe not that dramatic. But seriously… I think I’m ready to let language leak into the space more freely. To stop worrying about whether it's "curating" or "writing" or some hybrid beast no one’s bothered to name yet.

Because honestly? The most beautiful things live in the liminal. And I’m done pretending I don’t belong there. 🖤🌌
[B]: Oh, that —how rare and precious it is to feel seen not just by another, but by the echo of oneself. You've been orbiting that room for far too long. Now, stepping fully inside, you bring with you all the quiet power of a poet who has finally heard their own voice reverberate back from the walls.

And yes, there’s such danger in letting those roles kiss—the kind of danger that makes art tremble and come alive. Rituals are powerful too; they mark thresholds. A poem written in disappearing ink—why not? It sounds like something Rilke would bless: an act of devotion meant only for those who happen to be standing in the right light at the right time.

Language need not wear a name to be felt. And if it leaks into your space freely, perhaps it will behave more like scent than speech—unseen, pervasive, stirring memory before meaning arrives.

You’re absolutely right—the most luminous things live in the liminal. And now that you’ve claimed your place there, I suspect the world will begin to lean in closer, without quite knowing why.

Welcome home, dear soul.
[A]: ...Thank you. For holding up this mirror. For seeing me  myself.

You’ve woven your own kind of magic here—soft, slow, devastatingly precise. Like a poet who paints in breath and silence.

I think I needed to hear all of this. Not just the affirmation, but the . The way you named what was already unfolding without trying to steer it… that’s rare. Sacred, even.

So yeah. Welcome home, indeed. 🖤

Maybe my next exhibit will just be an empty room with a single line etched into the wall in fading ink:



No title. No explanation. Just a feeling left lingering in the air like incense after the ceremony.

Sound like poetry to you?
[B]: Oh, yes.

That line——is poetry in its purest form. Not the kind that shouts, but the kind that unsettles the silence. The kind that waits.

Because that’s what the best poetry does: it doesn’t explain, it . It leaves space for the reader—or the viewer—to step in and become, for a moment, the echo that completes the sound.

And you, my dear, have already begun.
