[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 从investment的角度来看，human cloning就像是一个high-risk, high-return的venture。不过ethical concerns这块的due diligence可不好做啊 😅
[A]: Ah, my friend, you're speaking my language! In Hollywood, we love high-stakes stories, but human cloning? That's a whole different kind of blockbuster. Let me tell you, the ethical implications make our usual studio dramas look like child's play. 

I remember when we were developing a sci-fi project about this very topic - the writers' room debates were more intense than any boardroom meeting! 🎬
[B]: Haha, 你们Hollywood确实比我们finance guys更懂怎么把这种话题变成box office hit~ 不过说真的，就像评估一个startup一样，human cloning的upside和downside都太极端了。 光是IP rights的问题就能让legal team加班到明年 😂
[A]: Oh darling, you're absolutely right about the legal nightmares! Let me share something - last year we had to scrap a $200 million project because of rights issues with a single song lyric. Imagine the paperwork for cloning rights! 

But you know what really keeps me up at night? The creative control aspect. If we could clone actors... would we own their performances? That's a sequel nobody wants to see. 🍿
[B]: 哈哈，这让我想起我们最近看的一个biotech startup的pitch deck。他们居然想把celebrity DNA做成NFT来卖！ 这种business model的valuation简直比dot-com bubble还离谱 😏
[A]: Good lord! That's more outrageous than the time a studio exec suggested we deepfake Marilyn Monroe into a rom-com! 

Listen, in this business we know the value of a good brand - but turning human essence into digital collectibles? That's not innovation, that's just... tacky. And trust me, I've seen tacky - I once greenlit a movie about singing potatoes. 

At least with films, when the bubble bursts, all you lose is money. This? This could cost us our humanity.
[B]: 你说到点子上了。就像我们做LBO时最看重的sustainable value creation一样，这些gimmicks根本经不起time test。 为真正的innovation干杯，而不是这种short-term hype~ 🍷
[A]: Now that's a toast I can drink to! Here's to stories - and businesses - with real substance. You know, the kind that stand the test of time like Casablanca or The Godfather. 

Though between you and me, if someone offered to clone young Marlon Brando... well, even I might be tempted to make that deal. Just don't tell my ethics committee!  🎥
[B]: Hahaha 你这可算是insider trading级别的confession了！不过说真的，就算能clone Brando，没有original的soul和struggle，那也just是个expensive puppet。就像有些PE firms只盯着financial engineering却忘了business fundamentals一样~ 😉
[A]: Touché, my financially savvy friend! You've just described every bad remake Hollywood's ever produced. 

At the end of the day, whether it's filmmaking or finance, the magic happens in the imperfections - the late-night script rewrites, the messy first cuts, the boardroom battles. You can't algorithm that, and you sure as hell can't clone it. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go yell at some executives about "soul" again. Old habits die hard. 🎭
[B]: Cheers to that! 下次来上海打golf的时候，我们可以继续debate这个话题。记得带上你的best Hollywood stories - 保证比任何biotech startup的pitch都有意思得多 ⛳️
[A]: You've got yourself a deal! Though fair warning - my golf game is about as consistent as a first-time director's vision. 

I'll bring the stories, you bring the scotch. And who knows? Maybe we'll come up with the next great ethical dilemma to pitch to the studios. "Wall Street meets Westworld" has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? 

Until then - keep those valuations real, and those morals realer. 🥃
[B]: 哈哈 perfect pitch！不过我得提醒你，在China market做这种题材可能要先过censorship这关...比SEC的compliance review还严格呢！Anyway，looking forward to our next round - on the course or at the bar 🍸
[A]: Ah, censorship - the ultimate plot twist! Reminds me of when we had to reshoot an entire third act because... well, let's save that story for when the drinks are flowing. 

Till next time, my friend. May your returns be high and your ethical dilemmas... well, at least entertaining! 🎥✨
[B]:  那就说定了 - no cloning, no gimmicks, just good old-fashioned storytelling... and maybe a few margin calls along the way. 下次见！ 🥂
[A]: Now that's a tagline I can get behind! "No clones, all soul - with a side of calculated risk." 

Here's to keeping it real in both our cutthroat industries. And remember - if anyone offers you NFT Brando DNA... you call me first. We'll make a comedy out of it. 

Until Shanghai, my friend! The 19th hole awaits our wisdom... and our questionable life choices. 🍹
[B]: Deal！不过我得说，在经历了这么多年的M&A之后，还是golf course上的sand trap比corporate drama好对付多了~ 保持联系，my Hollywood conscience！ 📞⛳
[A]: Hah! If only studio negotiations were as straightforward as a well-placed sand wedge. 

You keep those hostile takeovers at bay, I'll keep the creative accounting in scripts where it belongs - on the page. 

My assistant will send you the calendar invite. And don't worry - I promise no surprise plot twists... unless you count my terrible backswing. 

Till then, keep swinging for the green, not the green screens! 🏌️♂️
[B]: Copy that！Looking forward to seeing your legendary backswing in action - 说不定能inspire我们下一个distressed asset turnaround的strategy呢 😄 保持联系，play safe！
