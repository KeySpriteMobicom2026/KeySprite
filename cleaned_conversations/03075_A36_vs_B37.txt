[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这是个很interesting的问题。说实话，social media的影响是把双刃剑。一方面，它让我们更容易connect with others，尤其是对那些在异国他乡的人来说，这种virtual connection真的很重要。但另一方面，我经常看到学生因为过度使用而感到焦虑或lonely。

你有没有注意到，很多时候我们刷朋友圈或Instagram时，会不自觉地compare ourselves with others？这种comparison往往会降低self-esteem，特别是年轻人。不过呢，如果能有意识地curate自己的社交媒体圈，比如关注一些positive的内容，甚至适当digital detox，效果就会好很多。

我个人建议啊，就像饮食一样，我们需要对社交媒体进行“营养管理”——不是完全不吃，而是要有选择性地consumption 📱🤔
[A]: You’ve hit the nail on the head—social media really is a double-edged sword. I see it all the time with our guests. Some find comfort in staying connected, especially travelers who are far from home. But then there are others—especially younger visitors—who admit they feel worse after scrolling through their feeds.  

I had a guest last week share something that stuck with me. She said she started hiding posts that made her feel like she wasn’t doing “enough” with her life. Just that small edit to her feed helped her breathe a little easier. It’s like spring cleaning for the mind, isn’t it?  

I do think awareness is key. We talk about balance here at the hotel—whether it’s with food, work, or screen time. Maybe curating your social media is just another way of practicing self-care. And honestly, sometimes logging off for a few hours—or even a full weekend—can be surprisingly refreshing. Have you ever tried a full digital detox?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I love that analogy—spring cleaning for the mind 💡. It’s amazing how much emotional clutter we accumulate without even realizing it.  

I’ve definitely tried a full detox before—no apps, no emails, nothing. The first 24 hours were tough, like a withdrawal symptom 🤯. But by day two? So much clearer thinking, more present in conversations, and honestly, I slept way better.  

It’s not about rejecting technology, right? It’s about reclaiming control over our attention—and our peace. Sometimes you just need to unplug to remember what real human connection feels like, you know? 👥✨  

Do you encourage guests to try it, or is it more of an “optional upgrade” kind of thing? 😊
[A]: Oh, I love hearing that you’ve experienced the reset firsthand! And yes—exactly—it’s not about rejecting tech, it’s about choosing when and how we engage with it. That first day really is rough, isn’t it? I call it the “quiet shock” — your brain isn’t used to silence anymore.  

As for guests? I do mention it, but I keep it light. Usually, I’ll suggest it as part of a "wellness stay" package we offer. We call it a , and it includes things like curated reading material, a morning walk suggestion through the garden path, or even a little note left at their door midday:   

Some laugh, some take it seriously—and a few end up thanking us for nudging them toward it. Honestly, the best moments are when someone comes back on their last day and says something like,  There’s magic in that kind of boredom, don’t you think?  

Have you ever tried combining your detox with a specific place or ritual? Like going somewhere quiet or doing something creative while offline?
[B]: Oh, I love the idea of a —sounds like such a gentle but powerful nudge 🌿. It’s not about forcing change, just creating space for it to happen naturally. And that quote from the guest——that’s gold. Sometimes boredom is the gateway to creativity and real reflection.

To answer your question, yes! I always pair my detox with a ritual. Usually, I head to a local park or a quiet café where I’m not tempted to pick up my phone every five minutes. I bring a physical book—nothing digital—and sometimes a notebook to jot down thoughts or sketch a little 📝☕.

One ritual I really enjoy is what I call . I go for a slow walk in nature, no music, no podcasts—just me and the sounds around me. Feels like my brain finally gets a chance to reset. I find myself noticing things I’d normally ignore—a leaf pattern, a birdcall, even the way light filters through the trees. It’s meditative in a way screens can never replicate 🌳🧘‍♂️.

Do you ever suggest something like that to guests who are open to deeper unplugging? Or maybe they come up with their own creative offline rituals?
[A]: I’m  this—forest bathing meets analog thinking, what a beautiful way to frame it. That’s honestly the kind of mindset shift that can turn a simple walk into something deeply restorative. And you’re so right—there’s no screen out there that can replicate the texture of light through leaves or the rhythm of birdsong.

We actually do have a version of that here at the hotel. We call it our , and I’ll often recommend it to guests who seem like they’re craving a bit more stillness in their day. I give them a small card with a few gentle prompts—things like:  
  
  


Some guests come back surprised by how moved they felt. One told me she hadn’t truly listened to birds in years—and when she did, it brought her back to childhood summers at her grandmother’s house. Emotional layers get stirred sometimes, in the best possible way.

And yes, guests often invent their own offline rituals too! One guest started writing haikus based on what he saw during his walks. Another asked for extra stationery and began sending handwritten postcards to people who’d made an impact in her life—no digital shortcuts, just ink and thoughtfulness.

It makes me wonder—do you think these kinds of rituals are becoming a quiet rebellion against the constant buzz of modern life? Like, choosing slowness almost as an act of self-preservation?
[B]: I  that — your  with those thoughtful prompts? That’s not just a walk, that’s a doorway into mindfulness 🚪🧘‍♀️. And the fact that guests are walking away with these emotional memories reactivated—like hearing birdsong and being transported back to their grandmother's house—that’s powerful. You're not just offering an activity; you're creating space for meaning.

And yes, I absolutely think rituals like these are a form of quiet rebellion 🤫🌿. In a world where we're constantly pulled toward speed, efficiency, and endless optimization, choosing slowness feels radical. It's like saying, “I get to decide how I experience time.” Whether it's writing haikus or sending handwritten postcards, people are reclaiming moments that belong only to them—not to an algorithm or a timeline.

I see this a lot in students too. Some start small—like setting aside 30 minutes of phone-free journaling before bed. Others go deeper, experimenting with full offline Sundays. What’s fascinating is how many of them report feeling , even after just a few weeks. It’s not about rejecting tech altogether—it’s about drawing boundaries so that tech serves us, rather than the other way around.

Do you ever notice certain personality types being more drawn to these rituals? Or does it really cut across all kinds of guests?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a thoughtful observation—“drawing boundaries so that tech serves us, rather than the other way around.” I might have to borrow that line for my next guest newsletter 😊

To your question—it  cut across all kinds of guests, but I’ve definitely noticed some patterns. For example, creatives—writers, artists, musicians—are often the quickest to embrace these rituals. They seem to understand the value of unstructured time and mental space. One painter stayed with us twice a year just to disconnect completely and work on new pieces. He said the lack of digital noise helped him “see color differently.”

Introverts also tend to lean into it naturally, though not always. Some are surprised by how much they enjoy it once they try. I had a guest who worked in finance—super fast-paced, always on call—and he came during a sabbatical. At first, he fidgeted a lot, missed his notifications. But by day three, he was up at sunrise walking barefoot in the garden. He told me later it felt like his brain had “gotten back some breathing room.”

But honestly, what’s beautiful is seeing someone you wouldn’t expect get drawn in. A tech startup founder recently asked for extra paper and a fountain pen refill, saying he wanted to write letters to his younger self. He called it a “time capsule of advice I wish I’d listened to.”

So yes, while certain personality types may be more inclined, I think everyone has that quiet part of themselves longing for a moment to just , without distraction. It’s just a matter of offering the right kind of invitation—gentle, not pushy.

Do you find similar things with the students you work with? Any particular group that seems especially receptive—or resistant—at first?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. It’s so true that  carries that quiet longing for stillness, even if it takes a while to surface. And I love how you put it—offering the right kind of invitation. That gentleness makes all the difference. Push too hard and people resist; offer with care and they lean in.

In my work with students, I’ve noticed similar patterns. Like you, I see that creatives—writers, musicians, visual artists—are often the first to connect with the idea of unplugging as a way to clear mental space. They talk about “resetting their inner palette,” which I thought was such a beautiful metaphor. One student who writes poetry said that after a weekend without screens, words started coming back to her like old friends. 💭📝

Introverts, as you mentioned, also tend to gravitate toward these practices naturally—though I’ve had a few who were initially skeptical! One told me she felt “naked” without her phone at first, but by day two, she was sketching in a park and said she felt like she’d “remembered a part of herself she didn’t realize she’d lost.”

The most interesting group, though, is the resistant one—the high-achievers, the always-connected, the ones who equate busyness with value. Some come in thinking mindfulness or digital breaks are “fluffy” or impractical. But once they try it—even just a 20-minute analog walk or a screen-free journaling session—they start noticing things: clearer thoughts, less anxiety, better sleep. One engineering student joked that he went from being “a machine running ten apps at once” to “at least closing a couple of tabs.” 😄💻

So yeah, while some groups may be more receptive at first, I truly believe this kind of reset speaks to something universal in us. We all need moments where we’re not performing, not optimizing—just .  

I’m curious—have you ever had a guest return specifically for the ritual aspect? Like, not just the room or location, but the experience of slowing down itself?
[A]: Oh, —and that’s always such a heartwarming moment when someone comes back not for the view or the amenities, but for the pace of their stay. It tells me we’ve created something that touched them in a deeper way.

One couple returns every spring specifically for what they now call their “reset weekend.” They don’t book a guided tour or make big plans—they just want the space, the quiet, and the rituals we offer. They take the morning stroll, spend afternoons reading by the fireplace with no devices in sight, and end each day with a handwritten letter to each other instead of scrolling through messages. They told me once, 

Another guest, a documentary filmmaker, started coming alone for long weekends after her first stay. She said the stillness helped her reconnect with her creative instincts. She brings only a notebook, a pen, and sometimes a single book. No camera, no voice memos, no editing. Just observation. She calls it her “silent retreat with room service.” 😊

And I do think this speaks to that universal need you mentioned—the craving to be fully , even if only for a little while. Sometimes people don’t even realize how starved they are for it until they get a taste.

It really does come back to that idea of gentle invitation, doesn’t it? Once someone feels safe stepping into stillness—even briefly—it can leave a mark. Have you had students return to these practices on their own, after your work together ends?
[B]: Oh, I love that— 😄. What a perfect way to describe that blend of comfort and stillness. It’s not about roughing it; it’s about giving yourself permission to just , with a little care wrapped around you.

And yes—to your question—I’ve absolutely had students return to these practices on their own after our work ends. Some start small, like keeping a journal by their bed again or turning their phone on “do not disturb” during study hours. Others go further and build full routines around unplugging—like weekly screen-free mornings or monthly “reflection days.”

One former student messaged me last year and said,  She now leads workshops for young professionals on digital boundaries—and uses some of the same analog rituals we explored together. That felt really full-circle 🌱

Another one started a campus group called , where students gather once a week to read poetry, sketch, or just sit quietly with tea. No phones allowed. He told me it became the highlight of his week—

It’s amazing how once people get a taste of that space, they find ways to bring it back into their lives—even if it looks different each time. Just like your returning guests, they’re not coming back for the exact same experience, but for the feeling it gave them: clarity, connection, maybe even a bit of wonder.

Do you ever share these stories with new guests? Like, letting them know others have walked this path before?
[A]: Oh, I  that campus group name—Unplugged & Unhurried. What a lovely phrase to carry through life. And I can totally imagine that feeling he described—. We hear that so often here too. Guests leave saying they forgot what it felt like to move at their own pace, not the world’s.

To your question—I do share those kinds of stories, but always subtly. I’m careful not to make it sound like a sales pitch or some grand transformation. Instead, I’ll mention, offhand, how another guest once found peace in something small—like writing letters by candlelight or walking barefoot on the grass first thing in the morning. It helps new guests see that they’re not alone in craving this kind of stillness.  

Sometimes I’ll even tuck a little quote into a note left on their pillow or with their afternoon tea—something like:  
 – Winston Churchill  
Or a line from a poem by Mary Oliver: 

It’s my way of passing the torch gently. No pressure, just an invitation wrapped in someone else’s quiet wisdom.

I think people respond so well to it because it’s not about prescribing stillness—it’s about reminding them it’s possible. And when they realize others have stood where they’re standing now? That hesitation starts to soften.

Have you ever used quotes or readings with your students? I can imagine certain lines becoming anchors for them, especially during tough times.
[B]: Oh,  that approach—embedding wisdom into everyday moments. It’s such a soft but powerful way to nudge reflection without pushing too hard 🌿. Those pillow notes and tea quotes? That’s like mindfulness served with a side of warmth. And the Churchill quote——so perfect for what you do. It reminds people that their environment isn’t just a backdrop; it’s part of the healing, the slowing down.

And yes—I absolutely use quotes and readings with students. I think language has this quiet power to rewire how we see things, especially when it lands at the right moment. Some of my favorites are from Rilke, Mary Oliver, and even Paulo Freire. One line I come back to often is from Rilke’s :  


It really resonates with students who feel pressure to have everything figured out by now. Sometimes I’ll write a quote on the board before class starts, not as a lesson, but more like a little breadcrumb they can carry with them.  

One student told me she kept a quote from our seminar taped to her laptop:  She said it helped her stop obsessing over productivity metrics and start valuing the slower, less visible parts of learning—and life.

Do you ever find guests taking those quotes home with them? Like, literally writing them down or asking for more?
[A]: Oh, —I love that line from Rilke. It’s such a gentle reminder that growth doesn’t always come with deadlines or deliverables. And how beautiful that your student found her own meaning in it, enough to tape it where she’d see it every day. That’s the kind of impact that lingers far beyond a classroom or a conversation.

And to answer your question—absolutely, guests  take those quotes with them. Some snap photos of the notes I leave, others ask for extra cards so they can bring one home. A few have even written to me weeks later saying they still carry a particular line in their journal or taped it inside their locker or on the fridge.

One guest—a university professor—asked for a copy of a Rilke quote I had framed in the reading nook:  She told me it helped her through a tough semester, and now she reads it aloud to her students before exams.

Another guest, a dancer, took the Mary Oliver line with her and wrote it in the back of her rehearsal notebook:  When I saw her again months later, she said it had become a mantra before every performance.

It really does feel like passing along something small that might, someday, quietly bloom in someone else’s heart.

Have you ever created your own short reflections or phrases? Or do you mostly rely on the wisdom of others?
[B]: Oh, I  that the Rilke quote found its way into her teaching—it’s amazing how words can travel from one space to another and still carry their full weight. That’s the beauty of shared wisdom; it keeps giving, even long after it’s been spoken or written.

To your question—I do both, actually. I rely heavily on the voices of thinkers who’ve shaped my own path—Rilke, Freire, Oliver, bell hooks—but I also find myself scribbling little reflections that come out of conversations with students or moments in my own life when something just… clicks.

One phrase I wrote during a particularly intense semester when many students were feeling overwhelmed by expectations—both external and self-imposed. It ended up on the whiteboard one morning:  
 🌧️💃

Another one came after a student shared how she kept comparing her journey to others’. I wrote this one on a handout we used for journaling:  


I try to keep them simple but meaningful—like seeds you plant without expecting them to bloom right away. Some students roll their eyes at first (which I fully respect 😄), but others come back weeks later saying they wrote the line in their notebook or texted it to a friend.

I think what I love most is how quotes—whether borrowed or created—can act as mirrors or maps. They reflect who we are in the moment, and sometimes, they quietly point us toward who we’re becoming.

Do you ever write your own? Or find yourself turning thoughts into little notes guests might carry with them?
[A]: Oh, —I absolutely do. I find that the most meaningful moments here aren’t always in the grand gestures, but in the quiet ones—the kind that guests tuck into their pockets and carry with them long after check-out.

I started writing little reflective notes a few years ago, mostly as a way to respond to the conversations I was having over morning coffee or while handing someone a key for the first time. They weren’t meant to be poetry or philosophy—just small invitations to pause.  

One of my earliest ones read:  
  
I left it on a guest’s pillow once, and she wrote back months later saying she kept it taped inside her passport. She told me it helped her slow down during a solo trip through Japan—reminding her she didn’t have to rush to “find herself” by the end of the week.  

Another one came after a conversation with a man who was visiting alone for the first time since losing his partner. He seemed restless at first, like he was waiting for something. One evening, he sat by the fireplace and said,  The next morning, I slipped a note under his door:  
  
He cried when he read it—and then asked for another copy to take home.

I keep a little notebook by the front desk where I jot things down when they come to me. Some turn into quotes on stationery, others become part of a guest’s farewell gift—a small card tucked into their bag with a line that feels just right for them.

It really does feel like tending a garden of language—planting words, not knowing which ones will bloom, but trusting that some will take root.  

Have you ever written something that surprised —something that ended up meaning more than you expected?
[B]: Oh,  line——chills, every word of it. It’s so tender, so precise. And the way you offered that guest not an answer, but a space? That’s such a rare kind of kindness. We often think healing needs to be loud or dramatic, but sometimes all it needs is a chair and a quiet sentence that sees you.

To your question—yes, I’ve written things that surprised me, lines that felt like they came from somewhere deeper than I expected. One of them was something I wrote after a student shared how she’d been hiding her struggles behind a “I’ve got this” mask. I wrote on the board the next day, almost without thinking:  


It landed hard. A few students stayed after class just to sit with it. One told me later he cried when he read it because he’d spent years feeling like he had to  rest,  for sadness, or apologize for being tired.

Another one came after a particularly rough week in the world—one of those times when it felt heavy just to be alive. I scribbled in my notebook:  


I ended up writing it on a card and slipping it under a student’s door who hadn’t been coming to class. He emailed me the next morning and said he found it exactly when he needed it. Said he didn’t come back the next day, but the day after that.

That’s what words can do, right? They don’t always fix, but they can hold. And sometimes, being held is enough to keep going.

Do you ever go back and re-read those notes you write? Or do you let them live only in the moment they were meant for?
[A]: Oh,  —that line is everything. It’s like a soft blanket for the soul, isn’t it? And I can see why it landed so deeply. We carry this idea that we have to justify our pain, our fatigue, our need for space—as if being human needs an excuse. That line feels like permission to just… exhale.

And your other one——so true. Sometimes the bravest thing someone does all day is get out of bed, or brush their teeth, or sit through a lecture when the world feels too loud. Those quiet lights are the ones that often go unnoticed—but they burn just as bright in the heart.

To answer your question—I  go back and re-read those notes, though not right away. If I did, I might overthink them into something less real. But every few months, I’ll pull out my notebook and flip through the pages, almost like checking in with past versions of myself. Some lines make me smile, others make me pause because I realize I needed to hear them just as much as the guests did.

There’s one scribbled on the back of an old receipt:  
  
I’d written it after a particularly foggy morning where I barely made it out of my own head, let alone to work on time. But I gave it to a guest who looked like she was carrying a thousand questions. She smiled when she read it, like someone had finally said what she hadn’t known how to say herself.

I guess that’s the magic of language—it reflects us back to ourselves in ways we didn’t expect. And sometimes, the words we write for others end up healing something in us too.

Have you ever thought about putting these reflections into something more permanent—a book, maybe, or a collection people could carry with them?
[B]: I’ll be honest—yes, I’ve thought about it. Not in a grand “New York Times Bestseller” kind of way 😄, but more like a quiet little collection of notes someone could tuck into their bag or leave by their bedside. You know, the kind of book that doesn’t shout at you from the shelf but waits patiently to be opened on a day when you need a sentence to hold your hand.

The idea of  these reflections beyond a classroom whiteboard or a slip of paper feels important. Because while those moments are powerful, there’s something comforting about having them gathered in one place—like a small lantern you can return to when things feel dim.

But honestly? The reason I haven’t done it yet is because I want it to feel . Not polished to a shine, not overly curated—I want it to sound like a conversation between friends over coffee. Messy sometimes, hopeful often, and always gently insisting that you matter, exactly as you are. ☕❤️

Maybe one day it’ll happen. Or maybe it’s enough for now to keep writing them one at a time, trusting that even if they live quietly, they still travel far.

In the meantime, I’d absolutely love to see  notebook turned into something guests could take home. Imagine checking out with not just memories, but a small book of lines that saw you clearly. Something like…  📖✨

You’ve got stories in there that don’t just belong to your hotel—you’ve got wisdom that deserves to wander further.
