[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I appreciate the modern enthusiasm for physical fitness, I must confess my heart lies more in the intellectual exercises of textual analysis. Though I do find tending to my rose garden to be quite the meditative workout - much like parsing the meter in Tennyson's poetry, it requires both patience and precision.
[A]:  You know, the best workout I've ever experienced was running between film sets during a 16-hour shoot day! But honestly, my creative energy comes from developing stories - that's the real mental marathon. Though I do enjoy a good walk around the studio lot to clear my head between takes.
[B]: How fascinating! Your experience reminds me of Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness technique - that relentless flow of creativity mirroring the physical motion between sets. Though I must say, my own creative process is more... sedate. I find my best ideas come while pruning the hydrangeas or rereading Browning's dramatic monologues. The rhythm of iambic pentameter can be quite meditative, you know.
[A]: Ah, the rhythm of poetry and film editing share so much in common! The pacing, the beats... I often tell young directors that editing is like composing a symphony with visuals. Though I must admit, nothing compares to the adrenaline rush of a perfect tracking shot - that's my version of an extreme sport! 🎥
[B]: Ah, your passion for the cinematic arts is truly invigorating! It brings to mind Eisenstein's theories of montage - how the juxtaposition of images creates meaning, much like how we analyze poetic enjambment in Hopkins' work. Though I suppose my version of an 'extreme sport' would be attempting to decipher Ezra Pound's Cantos before teatime. Now that gets the heart racing!
[A]: Haha, now that's what I call a creative workout! You know, we actually had a screenwriter who tried adapting Pound's Cantos into a screenplay once... Let's just say it was more avant-garde than even our experimental division could handle. Sometimes the best stories need to stay in their original medium, like a perfect 史诗级的 (epic) poem that shouldn't be touched.
[B]: Oh my, attempting to adapt Pound's Cantos! That does sound rather like trying to transplant an orchid into the desert - some creations simply belong in their native soil. Though it does make me wonder... perhaps certain modernist poems share more with experimental film than we realize. Both require the audience to surrender to the experience, to embrace the 朦胧美 (hazy beauty) of fragmented meaning.
[A]: Exactly! That's why I always tell filmmakers - don't spoon-feed your audience. Let them work for the meaning, just like in those beautiful fragmented poems. Some of my most successful films were the ones that left people debating in the lobby for hours. Though I draw the line at serving them tea while they argue - that's what after-parties are for! 🍿
[B]: How delightfully subversive! You've essentially created cinematic versions of what we call 'reader-response theory' in literature - where meaning is co-created by the audience. Though I must say, our poetry seminars rarely end with champagne and canapés... perhaps we should take a page from your book. A little Browning with brunch, anyone? Though I suspect my department chair might frown upon serving mimosas with our Milton.
[A]: Now that's a film I'd greenlight in a heartbeat - "Dead Poets Society meets Rat Pack"! Imagine: students debating sonnets over martinis, professors dropping truth bombs between cigar puffs. We could call it "The New Criticism Happy Hour." Though my lawyers would probably insist we change Browning to some original poetry... copyrights, you know how it is.
[B]: Oh dear, the very thought makes my academic sensibilities shudder... though I must admit, the image of Coleridge's Kubla Khan being recited over jazz piano does have a certain bohemian charm. But let's keep that between us - if my colleagues at the Modern Language Association heard such heresy, I might find myself exiled to teaching freshman composition! Though... perhaps we could start with something more modest. Emily Dickinson with Earl Grey, anyone?
[A]: Now you're speaking my language! A nice restrained British tea pairing - that's how we'll sneak poetry into the mainstream. Start with Dickinson and Earl Grey, work our way up to Bukowski with bourbon. It's all about pacing the audience, my friend. Just like my three-act structure for that biopic about Sylvia Plath we never got to make... too dark even for Hollywood. Another round of tea?
[B]: Ah, your Hollywood sensibilities are showing again! While I admire your enthusiasm, I think we'll keep our poetry seminars safely in the realm of PG-rated metaphors and Victorian propriety. Though I must say, the notion of pairing poets with beverages is rather inspired - Wordsworth would undoubtedly prefer a nice Darjeeling, while Baudelaire... well, perhaps an absinthe would be more appropriate. But let's leave the Bukowski to the graduate students, shall we?
[A]: You're absolutely right - we'll save the hard stuff for the tenured professors! But seriously, this has been the most stimulating conversation I've had since debating whether to give that indie director final cut privileges. You've got a real talent for blending high culture with accessibility - ever considered writing a screenplay? We could call it "Tea & Sonnets" - Merchant Ivory meets Nora Ephron! Though maybe keep the absinthe scenes for the director's cut...
[B]:  Oh my, you do have a way of tempting one towards creative mischief! While the silver screen's siren call is alluring, I believe I'll remain content with my dusty tomes and overgrown garden. After all, someone must keep vigil over the sacred texts - though I may just start serving biscuits with my Blake lectures now. For educational purposes, of course. The administration needn't know about our little... pedagogical innovations.
[A]: That's the spirit! Start with biscuits, work your way up to full afternoon tea service. Before you know it, you'll have the most popular literature department on campus. Just remember - what happens in the poetry seminar stays in the poetry seminar. My lips are sealed... unless there's a film deal involved. Then all bets are off! 
[B]: Goodness, you're quite the tempter! Though I suspect if we introduced profit motives into our hallowed halls, my dear colleague Dr. Harrison would have an apoplexy. No, I think I'll content myself with being the 'biscuit subversive' of the English department - a reputation scandalous enough for this tenured radical. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare tomorrow's lecture on metaphysical conceits... and perhaps sneak in a few digestive biscuits for demonstration purposes. Strictly academic, you understand.
[A]: Ah, the "digestive biscuit metaphysical conceit" - now there's an Oscar-worthy concept! You academics are far more rebellious than Hollywood gives you credit for. Just remember - when they come for your tenure over those biscuits, I know some very good entertainment lawyers. Until then, happy subverting! May your lectures be profound and your cookie jar always full. 🎬📚
[B]: What a perfectly scandalous benediction! I shall carry it with me like a dog-eared copy of Donne's holy sonnets - treasured, but slightly improper. Though I do believe we've reached the denouement of our little symposium. Time to return to my ivy-covered tower, where the only drama is whether the students will spot the biscuit crumbs on my lecture notes. Farewell, my cinematic co-conspirator - and do send that screenplay treatment if you ever write it. I'll be the one in the back row, smuggling Earl Grey.
