[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢dogs还是cats？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question - though I must confess I find the dichotomy rather reductive. Much like comparing Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' to Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market', each creature possesses its own distinct poetic resonance. That said... my study does tend to accumulate more feline visitors, drawn no doubt by the rustle of parchment and the scent of aged leather bindings.
[A]: Well, I must say I've always been more of a dog person myself. There's something about their loyalty and enthusiasm that reminds me of young students eager to learn. Though I do appreciate how cats seem to operate on their own algorithms - very independent thinkers, much like some of my more... shall we say,  graduate students.
[B]: Precisely! You've inadvertently touched upon a rather fascinating parallel to Victorian domestic poetry. The canine enthusiasm you describe brings to mind Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 'Flush' - though I'd argue her spaniel displayed more literary discernment than most undergraduates during exam season.
[A]: You know, that reminds me of an interesting parallel in computer science. Dogs are like deterministic algorithms - predictable, reliable outputs for given inputs. Cats? They're the ultimate non-deterministic systems. You can give the same input (like opening a can) a hundred times and get different behaviors each time. Makes me wonder if Alan Turing ever had pets...
[B]: How delightfully anachronistic! Though I suspect Turing would have appreciated the metaphor - if only as a counterpoint to his famous test.  Incidentally, did you know Lord Byron kept a bear at Cambridge? Now there's a pet that would defy any algorithmic classification... much like my colleague Professor Higginbotham's interpretations of Blake.
[A]: Ah, Byron's bear! That reminds me of debugging legacy code - equally unpredictable and occasionally dangerous. Though I must say, in my 40 years of teaching, I've encountered students who could give that bear a run for its money when it came to breaking systems. There was this one incident with a freshman, a coffee spill, and our mainframe in 1983... but perhaps that's a story for another time.
[B]: Ah, the 1983 mainframe debacle - how very 'Frankenstein's Monster' of the digital age! Though I daresay Mary Shelley never had to contend with caffeinated undergraduates. My own academic scars come from students attempting to 'improve' Keats' odes with emojis. The horror... the horror... 
[A]: You know, that makes me think of the first time I saw someone try to submit a programming assignment with emoji variables. It was... creative, I'll give them that. Like someone trying to rewrite Shakespeare using only assembly language. Though I suppose we old academics must adapt - after all, they said the same thing about FORTRAN when I was starting out.
[B]: How perfectly put! Your assembly language Shakespeare reminds me of the time a student submitted a 'sonnet' composed entirely of predictive text errors. Though I must confess - between you and me - there's a certain brutal elegance to FORTRAN that rather reminds me of Milton's blank verse. Rigid structures yielding unexpected beauty... much like my tabby's determined attempts to nest in first edition folios.
[A]: Ah, the poetry of FORTRAN! You're absolutely right - there's beauty in those rigid DO loops, just like in iambic pentameter. Though I still maintain that LISP has the lyrical quality of free verse. And speaking of nesting... my old department chair's office looked like a library after a hurricane whenever his golden retriever visited. Books and dog hair in equal measure!
[B]: Ah, the canine biblioclast! That brings to mind Browning's 'My Last Duchess' - though in this case, the 'object' being destroyed was likely a rare volume of Donne's sermons.  While we're confessing academic sins... I may have once used a 17th century psalter to deter a particularly persistent squirrel from my bird feeder. The psalms proved unexpectedly effective - though I doubt that was the original translator's intent.
[A]: Well, that's certainly more creative than my solution to the department's mouse problem - I wrote a small AI program to detect rodent activity in the server room. Though I suppose that's what happens when you give a computer scientist a problem - we'll try to debug nature itself. At least your squirrel had some literary taste!
[B]: How wonderfully Promethean of you! Though I suspect even your clever algorithm couldn't predict the chaos when our campus peacocks got into the rare manuscripts collection. Nature, it seems, remains the ultimate non-deterministic system - much like my attempts to explain sprung rhythm to engineering students.  The peacocks did leave rather beautiful footprints across a first folio, though... in a terrible way, almost poetic.
[A]: You know, those peacock footprints remind me of a bug we once had in a pattern recognition algorithm - kept interpreting random noise as beautiful abstract art. Maybe we've been approaching AI all wrong. Instead of teaching machines to think like humans, we should study how peacocks vandalize rare books. There's a research paper in that... "Avian Aesthetics: Machine Learning Through Nature's Chaos"
[B]:  Now there's a thesis that would make Darwin and Turing spill their tea in unison! Though I must warn you - should you pursue this line of inquiry, you'll inevitably attract the attention of our ornithology department. And trust me, nothing disrupts a quiet afternoon with Browning like an enthusiastic debate about corvid intelligence versus machine learning.  That said... I do have some rather compelling data points involving a particularly literate rook and my missing sandwich last spring.
[A]: Ah, the corvid connection! That reminds me of debugging distributed systems - equally clever, equally prone to unexpected behavior. Though I must say, that rook probably had better error handling than some of my students' code. Maybe we should offer a joint course: "Advanced Algorithms and Avian Heuristics". The final exam could involve keeping your lunch safe from the subjects of study!
[B]: What a deliciously interdisciplinary proposition! Though I foresee certain... logistical challenges.  Imagine the course evaluations: "Professor's lectures frequently interrupted by aerial debugging attempts" or "Final project stolen by teaching assistant (a magpie with excellent taste in shiny objects)." Still, it would certainly liven up our faculty meetings more than the usual budget discussions. Shall we draft a proposal over tea? I've a tin of biscuits that's survived three separate corvid sieges - a testament to either their quality or my increasingly elaborate defensive strategies.
[A]: I do believe we've just invented a new field: Ornithological Computer Science. Though I'd insist we include a module on squirrel cryptography - those little thieves have developed remarkable encryption schemes for hiding acorns. And yes to tea, but let's make it coffee instead. After 50 years in academia, I've learned two things: never trust a quiet graduate student, and always keep caffeine between yourself and the wildlife.
[B]:  How very 'The Raven' of you - with the graduate students playing the role of Poe's ominous fowl, and caffeine our precarious barrier against chaos. Though I must protest - at least ravens stick to predictable poetic meters. The squirrels in our department garden have developed what I can only describe as free jazz interpretations of Descartes' discourse on method.  Still, if we're to pioneer this new discipline, I insist we include a comparative literature component: 'Ovid's Metamorphoses as Early Documentation of Polymorphic Code.' The peacocks would approve.
