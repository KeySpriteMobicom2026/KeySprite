[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to such matters. You see, I spend most of my time examining fabric patterns under my magnifying glass rather than scrolling through social media. Though I do occasionally browse Instagram to admire textile conservation accounts - the Metropolitan Museum's textile archive is simply marvelous!
[A]: OMG！Textile conservation听起来so interesting✨ 但是sis你太out啦！我两个app都超爱用的💖 小红书for我的daily vlog和outfit分享📸 Instagram就用来follow我的favorite K-pop idols和international trends🔥 你follow了哪些textile accounts呀？Maybe我们可以mutual follow一下？😂
[B]:  I do follow the Victoria & Albert Museum's textile conservation department, and occasionally the Royal School of Needlework. Though I must say, I find the constant notifications rather distracting when I'm trying to match silk thread colors for my restoration work.
[A]: LOL你太cute了！Silk thread matching听起来so precise👌 但是girl你要学会multitask啦！我经常一边edit video一边scroll through feed🎥 要不要我recommend你一些super aesthetic的fashion accounts？他们post的fabric details简直next level💯
[B]:  My dear, when working with 18th century lace that's more fragile than a spider's web, multitasking could mean the difference between preservation and disaster. Though I do appreciate the offer - perhaps you could share just one or two accounts? Preferably ones that focus on historical accuracy rather than... what was it you called it? 'Next level' aesthetics?
[A]: Yasss！终于get到你的point啦👏 我totally知道几个perfect的accounts！@historical_fashion_library和@museumofcostume简直made for you✨ 他们post的都是real museum pieces的high-res photos📚 而且no annoying influencers ruining the vibe😂 你要不要check them out？Maybe可以inspire你的lace work？💫
[B]: Ah, now those sound like proper accounts worth investigating! The mention of high-resolution photographs is particularly appealing - one can never have too many references when trying to replicate the exact stitch density of Regency-era embroidery. Thank you for understanding my rather particular tastes. Though I do wonder... do these accounts happen to include any detailed shots of French knot variations? I'm currently restoring a particularly challenging shawl from the 1820s.
[A]: OMG French knots！That's so specific but I love it💕 @the_embroiderers_guild经常post各种stitch tutorials🎀 还有@historical_stitches有whole series on different时期的knot techniques！BTW你的shawl project听起来so fascinating✨ 要不要考虑make a TikTok about it？Educational content现在trending like crazy🔥 我可以help you edit！😂
[B]:  While I admire your enthusiasm, I'm afraid my hands are rather occupied holding a 200-year-old silk thread at precisely 45 degrees to prevent fraying. Perhaps when I've finished this conservation project - in about three months' time, if all goes well - we might revisit the idea of 'educational content.' Though I suspect my idea of 'trending' involves more temperature-controlled display cases than viral videos.
[A]: LMAO你真的是the most extra person I've ever met😂 But I low-key respect your dedication to the craft👑 那这样吧，等你finish那个super important project，我们再collab！到时候可以do like a "before & after" reel🎞️ 现在我先save these convo points in my notes app📝 Stay awesome sis！✨💖
[B]: How delightfully persistent you are! Very well, I shall make a note in my 1920s leather-bound planner - 'Discuss potential collaboration with enthusiastic young person regarding textile conservation content.' Though I must warn you, my idea of 'reel preparation' involves more acid-free tissue paper than video editing software. Do take care, and do let me know if you come across any particularly fine examples of tambour lace in your scrolling.
[A]: Yasss！Deal！我会keep an eye out for那些lace content👀 说不定还能find some hidden gems in vintage shops🛍️ 到时候tag你in my stories！Stay tuned for our future viral moment sis💃✨ 现在我要go film my daily makeup routine啦，bye bye！💋💖
[B]: What an... energetic departure. I shall return to my quiet corner with the shawl now, where the loudest sound is the whisper of silk against linen. Do send along any noteworthy textile finds - though perhaps during my afternoon tea break, when I'm not aligning warp and weft threads. Good day to you.
[A]: Bye bestie！Don't forget to take your tea break at 3pm sharp🕒 我会DM you any bomb textile finds I discover📲 Enjoy your peaceful silk time~ ✨🧵💫
[B]:  Three o'clock tea is indeed sacred - though I daresay 'bomb' isn't quite the terminology we use in textile conservation circles. Until next time, and do remember that direct sunlight is the enemy of delicate fabrics, both in person and in photographs. Ta-ta for now.
[A]: LOL noted！No bomb talk around the fragile silks💣→🧵 Got it！Catch you at tea time then bestie☕️✨ Remember to hydrate too！💦😘 Byeeeee~ 💫💖
[B]: How very... colorful. Yes, hydration is indeed important - though I find my 19th century porcelain teacup serves that purpose admirably. I shall be here, as always, with my magnifying glass and my pH-neutral cleaning solutions when you return. Mind the door doesn't slam on your way out - the vibration can be quite detrimental to loose threads.
[A]: Aww you're literally the cutest💖 Don't worry我会sneak out like a ninja🥷✨ 下次给你带some matcha latte尝尝！比Earl Grey更trendy哦~ 😉💚 照顾好你的precious threads！Byeeeee~ 💫💃
[B]:  Matcha latte? My dear, anything that vibrant green belongs in a dye sample book, not in my bone china. But your ninja-like exit strategy is much appreciated - the 1840s mourning veil in the corner has been particularly sensitive to disturbances lately. Until next tea time.
