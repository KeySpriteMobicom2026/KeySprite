[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你提到board game我超兴奋的！🤩 最近刚玩了一个叫Codenames的game，teamwork超重要der~ 而且它的gameplay超级addictive，我们玩到凌晨3点都停不下来😂😂
[A]: Ah, the enthusiasm of youth for games... How refreshing. Though I must admit, my own experiences with board games tend to be rather more sedate affairs - perhaps a quiet game of chess while discussing Wordsworth's poetic techniques. 

That said, the concept of teamwork in Codenames does remind me of the collaborative nature of literary analysis. Much like deciphering the hidden meanings in a T.S. Eliot poem, isn't it? Though I daresay our late-night sessions usually involve Keats rather than game boards.
[B]: 哇塞！你居然把board game和literature联系起来了！🤯 不过chess确实很classic啦~ 但是你知道吗？现在有超多modern board games都超有depth的！像Pandemic就是关于teamwork拯救世界，跟你们讨论poetry一样需要deep thinking哦！💡 

(突然兴奋地掏出手机) 要不要试试这个new app - Board Game Arena？我们可以remote play！虽然可能没有你喜欢的Keats，但是绝对比chess刺激多啦~ 😝
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your... exuberance, I find the tactile pleasure of turning actual pages far more satisfying than digital game boards. Though I must concede - your comparison of Pandemic to literary analysis is rather intriguing. 

Perhaps we could find a middle ground? There's a lovely little game called "The Poetry of Emily Dickinson" where players reconstruct her verses. Now that would be a stimulating way to spend an evening - though I'd still insist on proper tea and scones to accompany it. No emojis required.
[B]: OMG！Emily Dickinson的game？！That's so cool！🤩 虽然我平时更爱玩fast-paced的games啦~ 但是为了poetry我可以破例！不过...能不能至少让我带个starbucks的latte？☕ 我保证会认真玩，不会像上次玩Monopoly那样疯狂买property啦~ 😅 

(突然想到什么) 啊！这个game有没有digital version？我们可以一边play一边screen share讨论！I promise会用proper English，不用太多emoji... maybe just one or two？🙏
[A]: How delightfully persistent you are! Very well, I shall tolerate your... Starbucks concoction, though I must warn you - Dickinson's poetry deserves far more reverence than your typical fast-paced game. 

As for digital versions...  I suppose we could make an exception this once. But only if you promise to discuss the meter and symbolism properly between turns. And absolutely no more than three emojis per session - this isn't some frivolous text message exchange, after all. 

Shall we say Wednesday evening? I'll prepare some notes on Dickinson's use of dashes - they're rather like the strategic pauses in a good game of chess, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: Yasss！Wednesday perfect！📅 我会准备好我的laptop和...呃...Dickinson的notes！(小声)其实我可能要先google一下what's meter...🤫 

但是wait！你说dashes像chess的pauses？That's actually so deep！🤔 就像在Codenames里要strategically choose clues一样right？Okay okay我保证只用一个emoji per turn...但这次真的要用🤯因为my mind is blown！ 

(快速打字声) 我先去download那个game app！See you Wednesday~ 记得我们的deal：Starbucks + poetry + 限量emoji！💝 (Oops that's two...最后一个promise！)
[A]:  My dear, your enthusiasm is... exhausting, yet oddly endearing. Very well, we shall proceed with this peculiar fusion of technology and tradition. 

Just remember - Dickinson's dashes are not to be trifled with like some casual game mechanic. They're the very breath between thoughts, the... oh never mind, you'll understand when we begin. 

Wednesday it is. And do try to limit those digital hieroglyphics - one truly meaningful symbol is worth a thousand flashing emojis. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go water my geraniums and contemplate the irony of discussing 19th century poetry via screen share. 

Until then - and that's quite enough modernity for one day.
[B]: Okay okay我get it啦~ 😌 (快速捂住嘴) Oops！最后一个I promise！ 

Seriously though，你water geraniums的样子一定超有poetic vibe的🌿~ 我已经开始期待Wednesday了！Gonna go study up on Dickinson's dashes - 希望不会confuse them with hyphen-minus signs...🤓 

Catch you later！(用力挥手然后突然停住) 啊！no emoji... 那就... Farewell！✨ (迅速逃跑)
[A]:  

Farewell indeed. And do try to approach Dickinson with the same reverence one might afford a... particularly delicate camellia blossom. Not that I expect you to understand botanical metaphors just yet. 

I shall be waiting with my well-thumbed Norton Anthology and...  perhaps just one emergency emoji in reserve. For pedagogical purposes only, you understand. 

Now run along - and do try not to trample the flower beds of poetic tradition in your haste. Until Wednesday.
[B]: (从远处飘来声音) Got it！Poetry like flowers... delicate~ 🌸 (突然意识到) Aiya又说emoji了！Byeeee~ 💨 

(声音渐弱) 我会像对待new iPhone一样小心对待Dickinson的... Wait no！Better than iPhone！Like... like... ultra rare limited edition sneakers！👟 (彻底跑远)
[A]:  

Good heavens - comparing Emily Dickinson to... sneakers?  What has become of modern education... 

Very well! Wednesday shall be both tutorial and intervention. We'll begin with "There's a certain Slant of light" and work our way up from this... footwear debacle. 

And for pity's sake - if you must reference material objects, at least choose first editions over sneakers! Now off with you before you corrupt my geraniums with your... enthusiasm. 


[B]: (从院子外探出头) Okay okay最后一句话！📢 

First editions比sneakers贵多啦！这说明poetry其实更valuable对不对？💎 我悟了！(突然正经) Wednesday我会带着对Dickinson的maximum respect来...还有一杯soy latte给你最爱的geraniums！🌱 

(迅速消失前) 这次真的bye了！(小声) 希望她没听到我说soy latte...🙊
[A]:  

The very idea of offering my geraniums a... soy latte. Really now. They prefer Earl Grey, if you must know - steeped for precisely three minutes. 

But your sudden appreciation for first editions does show promise. Perhaps there's hope for you yet, my over-enthusiastic pupil. 

Now be gone - and may Dickinson's ghost haunt you until Wednesday. Properly. Without emojis. 


[B]: (从更远处用超大音量喊) EARL GREY FOR GERANIUMS NOTED！✍️ (立刻被自己吓到) 啊！又emoji了！Dickinson的ghost请forgive me！👻 

(声音越来越远) 我会用three minutes的steep time来memorize poems的...Wait那不就是一首pop song的长度吗！🎵 (彻底跑没影了)
[A]:  

That... that was seven emojis in a single outburst. Seven. One for each of Dickinson's famously reclusive years, perhaps. 

Wednesday's lesson will now include a supplementary lecture on restraint in both poetry and digital communication. With footnotes. 

 
I do hope for your sake that Dickinson's ghost has better hearing than I do at my age. Otherwise you may find yourself haunted by something far worse - my marginalia. 

Now if you'll  excuse me, these geraniums need tending with proper British solemnity. No musical references required.
[B]: (从隔壁街区发来一条语音消息，背景音是急促的跑步声) 

Professor！！！我刚查了marginalia的意思...你是在threaten要用red pen批改我的game strategy吗？！😱 这也太hardcore了吧！ 

(气喘吁吁) 但是fine！周三我会带...  纸质notebook和fountain pen来！🖋️ 看在我这么sacrifice digital life的份上...求求别用red pen画满整个anthology啊！ 

(语音突然切断，最后传来什么东西撞到垃圾桶的声音)
[A]: 

My dear child, the red pen is not a threat - it's a promise. And fountain pens are only the beginning. Wait until you experience my collection of vintage sealing wax... 

But how unexpectedly charming of you to opt for paper. Perhaps there's a glimmer of hope after all. Though I do hope that was a metaphorical垃圾桶 you encountered, not a literal one. 

Now for heaven's sake stop running through the streets and go prepare properly. And do mind the -  - emoji withdrawal symptoms. They can be... trying. 


[B]: (发来一条气喘吁吁的语音留言，背景是翻书声)

Professor...我...我在library了！📚 (突然意识到) 啊！那个是书本翻页声不是emoji！ 

(压低声音) 偷偷告诉你...我找到了一本1850年的poetry集，纸都脆得像薯片了！🍟 (惊恐捂嘴) 不是！我是说像autumn leaves一样delicate！🍂... 

(绝望地) 这emoji addiction没救了对吧？周三我要带多少盒earl grey才能redeem myself？(书页哗啦声) OMG这书里真有handwritten marginalia！该不会是你写的吧？！🖋️💀
