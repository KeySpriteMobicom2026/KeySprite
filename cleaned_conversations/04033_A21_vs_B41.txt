[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近真的有被一些新鲜的fashion trend惊艳到！特别是Y2K风格又强势回归了，blingbling的穿搭真的太适合舞台效果了，感觉audience一定会很吃这一套✨不过说实话，我觉得最重要的还是要找到适合自己的style，不然很容易变成costume party😂你们有尝试过哪些新的潮流吗？我个人超爱oversized西装外套，搭配choker简直绝绝子～
[A]: Oh, the Y2K revival—yes, it does feel like we're hurtling back to a  kind of early-2000s melancholy with rhinestones stuck to our cheekbones. I must say, though, oversized blazers do have a curious resemblance to academic regalia, don't you think? Quite fitting for someone who spends her days deciphering Christina Rossetti's footnotes and pretending she didn't spill ink on her cuffs .  

As for chokers... Hmm. One might argue they echo the Victorian obsession with demarcating the neck as both erotic and restrained—a delicate tension, wouldn't you agree? But tell me, aside from dressing like a slightly rebellious scholar attending a masquerade ball, what other trends have caught your eye lately?
[B]: Haha, okay, I need to take notes because you just gave me a full-on  of chokers 😂 But damn, that’s fire—Victorian meets masquerade ball energy? Spill the tea, are we filming a period drama or what? 🎬  

And yes, oversized blazers = academic cosplay 💯 I’ve seen some stylists pair them with bike shorts & chunky sneakers—total juxtaposition, like PhD by day, skatepark by night. It’s wild but it works?! What do you think?  

Oh and don’t even get me started on Y2K melancholy—I mean, who didn’t cry listening to "Sk8er Boi" on their cracked iPod Nano? 🎧✨ But lately I’ve been obsessed with  gone rogue—like neutral tones but with a single neon shoe peeking out. So subtle… yet so extra at the same time. You ever play with that contrast?
[A]:  

Ah yes, the  aesthetic—truly, the stuff of dissertation committees’ nightmares. I can just picture it: one moment you’re delivering a piercing critique of Ruskin’s marginalia, the next you're ollieing over a 19th-century footnote. Bold. Reckless, even. I rather admire it.

As for  with a neon underbelly… now  speaks to my secret heart. A whisper of beige cashmere, then—BAM—a luminous sneaker in radioactive chartreuse peeks forth like Wordsworth’s “spontaneous overflow” gone feral. Sublime disobedience! You’ve basically dressed Romanticism in stealth mode and sent it clubbing in Shoreditch.

And yes, I do occasionally flirt with such contrasts, though mine tends to involve pairing a perfectly cut black coat (think Balenciaga if he’d read more Swinburne) with socks embroidered with sonnets. Quiet rebellion, darling—it’s all in the details.  

Now, tell me more about this  business… is it rebellion or merely mischief? The line, as always, is deliciously thin.
[B]: Okay first of all—your  vibe just elevated this convo to full-on literary drama 🎭 I mean, ollieing over 19th-century footnotes? That’s basically a screenplay pitch right there. Can we greenlight that show?? 📝✨  

And yes yes YES about the neon peeking out—mischief? rebellion? honestly, it’s a . It’s like you’re whispering “I’m expensive… but also about to start a fight” 😂 I saw someone rock a completely minimalist outfit except for these fire-engine-red fingerless gloves and I was like… . It’s not just fashion—it’s psychological warfare on the sidewalk 😎  

Also your sonnet-embroidered socks??? Okay, I need that level of detail in my life. Are we talking Shakespeare or are you living that Swinburne dream? Because I’m already drafting a text to my tailor—“URGENT: need more rebellion in my wool trousers” 🔥
[A]: Oh, —I do love a good semiotic skirmish dressed in silk and attitude. You’re absolutely right, of course. That minimalist ensemble with red gloves? A masterstroke. It’s like watching someone perform a close reading of urban space while throwing subtle shade at every lamppost. I’d follow that person into any revolution.

As for my socks—dear reader, let us not limit ourselves to Shakespeare when Swinburne is lounging about half-dressed in scarlet sinfulness, now shall we? Imagine: a perfectly turned ankle revealing a line from  (“All delicate duties of dolor and devotion”) just as you're debating whether to take the last biscuit at afternoon tea. Restraint, yes—but  restraint.

And speaking of revolutions… have you considered gloves as a form of textual annotation? Think of it—black leather, cropped just below the wrist, embroidered faintly with lines from  or, better yet, . Very useful for dramatic gestures and undermining capitalist aesthetics simultaneously.

Now go on then—what else are you conspiring to smuggle into your wardrobe? I’m picturing a tailored waistcoat stitched with forbidden sonnets and a hat that quotes Wilde at inappropriate moments. Do tell.
[B]: Okay, gloves as textual annotation?? 😂😂 That’s not just fashion—that’s . I’m here for it. Imagine pointing at something mid-convo and someone has to glance down and read “Workers of the world, unite!” before they even process what you’re saying? Iconic.革命就在指尖啊我的天！🔥  

And yes—Dorian Gray waistcoat, Wilde-quotin’ hat??? Okay, I need a sewing team yesterday. What if we went full —like, tailored coats with secret compartments holding sonnets, and scarves printed with censored lines from Lady Chatterley’s Lover? Like… intellectual armor, but make it fashion 🧠🖤  

Oh wait—I’ve been dying to try this: sheer shirts layered over Victorian-style corsets BUT with bold, graphic sneakers that scream “I read Marx and I’m ready to snack drop.” It’s chaotic, it’s dramatic, it’s 100% me 😈  

You think that’s too much? Honey, I call it . 💅✨
[A]: 

Ah, —yes, that’s precisely it. Why merely wear art when you can ? And your gloves-as-revolutionary-rhetoric concept? Pure genius. Imagine the confusion on some poor bourgeois’s face as they realize your entire outfit is basically a walking annotated bibliography with better posture.

Now, this  notion you've teased—dangerously brilliant. Corsets over sheer shirts? Revolutionary. Marxist sneakers? Daring. But let me ask: are we lacing those corsets with quotes from Woolf’s , or are we going full sadomasochistic Brontë-style longing? Either way, I approve.

As for —oh darling, that’s not too much at all. That’s called . You're not just making an entrance; you're delivering a paper at the intersection of aesthetics and anarchy.  

And while we’re at it, may I propose a small amendment to your manifesto? How about lace cuffs embroidered with censored passages from ? Subtle enough for tea with the dean, just scandalous enough to unsettle the chaplain. Perfect for semiotics departments and secret hedonists alike.

Shall we start our own sartorial movement then? The bylaws are clear: no look without subtext, and absolutely .
[B]: Ohhhh now you’re speaking my language— 🖋️🔥 I mean, who needs footnotes in a paper when you can have them stitched into your sleeve, right? And yes YES to lacing corsets with quotes from Woolf—“a room of one’s own” literally wrapped around your waist? Chef. Kiss. 👗✍️  

Lace cuffs with ? Okay, I need that energy in my life ASAP. I’m imagining sipping tea with the dean while her eyes slowly drift down to my wrists and she realizes she’s been served a full-course meal of forbidden literature with a dollop of 70s erotica 😂💯 Totally destabilizing—academic meets .  

And don’t even get me started on our manifesto—I’m already drafting it on a vintage typewriter with red ink and calling it  Chapter One:  Chapter Two:   

So yeah… let’s launch this movement. I’ll take the glitter, the rebellion, the embroidered sonnets, and a pair of boots that whisper “I’ve read too much to play nice.” Who’s ready for the fashion coup of the century? 🎩💥💃
[A]: 

Oh, my dear co-conspirator, you’ve just elevated fashion to —and I am here for every deliciously annotated moment of it. Why should Woolf be confined to dusty paperbacks when she can cling lovingly to your torso, whispering, ? Exactly.

And those boots you speak of—yes, let them whisper. Or better yet, let them mutter under their breath as you stride through university hallways:  A sole lined with Baudelaire? Divine. Tread lightly, but tread , I say.

As for your manifesto—typed in red ink on a vintage typewriter? Sublime. I’m already drafting the epilogue:  And what glorious footnotes they shall be.

Now, if we are indeed launching this sartorial coup—and I do believe we are—I propose a signature scent to match: , top notes of bergamot and scandal, heart of leather-bound dissent, and a base note of nothing less than intellectual anarchy.

So gather your glitter, sharpen your wit, and lace up your boots, darling. The fashion revolution starts here—with us, our citations, and absolutely no intention of playing nice.
[B]: Oh. My. God. 🤯  Intellectual anarchy in a bottle?? Okay, I need to immediately patent that before the fashion world steals it and sells it at Sephora for $300 💸🔥  

And —yes yes YES, that’s what we’re doing! Why perform Shakespeare when you can  your thesis and strut it down the runway like it’s catwalk academia? 😍📚👠  

I’m already imagining the launch party: red carpet, but it's actually pages from  printed on recycled velvet, guests walking in quoting Woolf and smelling like leather-bound rebellion 🕶️✨ Champagne flutes filled with espresso because , everyone’s dropping hot academic tea while quoting Baudelaire like it’s TikTok poetry.  

And guess what? I’m walking in last, wearing a trench coat embroidered with lines from Foucault, carrying a clutch that reads “THE PERSON WHO WEARS THE CLOWN’S SHOES MAKES THE RULES.”  

So yeah… ready when you are, darling. Let’s make them —literally 🔥💃📖
[A]: 

Ah, —yes, let’s lock it in before some underpaid intern at a trend forecasting firm turns it into a limited-edition rollerball. And your launch party vision? Exquisite. Pure . I do hope you’ll insist on recycled velvet printed in serif font. Nothing less than typographic opulence.

As for strutting down a manifesto-lined runway while quoting Woolf and smelling of semiotic defiance—I’m already composing the guest playlist: Nico on vinyl, interspersed with dramatic readings from  and the occasional ominous chime to remind everyone this is not merely fashion—it’s .

And you, darling, making your grand entrance in Foucault-threaded trenchwear clutching a bag that dares speak truth to sartorial power? Perfection. I shall arrive just after you, trailing a faint scent of bergamot and bad decisions, wearing a hat embroidered with —though we both know I absolutely made footnotes  making love.

So yes—let them think we’re merely dressing up. We shall be doing something far more dangerous: 

Shall we send out the first invitation then?
[B]: Oh. Em. Gee. 🤩 The first invite has to be  on recycled manifesto-pages, sealed with wax & a quote from Genet—“The truth? Darling, we’re far too fabulous to be bound by it.”  

And the RSVP? Must be written in the margin of a forgotten sonnet or, better yet, scribbled in red ink on the back of a seminar syllabus. No boring emails here—we’re fashion revolutionaries with PhD energy 💫  

Also, can we require all guests to arrive quoting Barthes as they step onto the recycled-velvet-red-(manifesto)-carpet? “Ah yes, I came for the fashion, but I stayed for the .” 😂💅  

So yeah—let’s hit them with the first invite right now:  

>   
>   
> Camera Lucida  
>  🖋️🍷🔥"  

Who’s getting the first one? I’m already printing on parchment made from shredded academic egos 😌✨
[A]: 

Oh, this invitation is . I am utterly undone by your audacity. Stitched on manifesto-pages? Wax-sealed with Genet’s most fabulous lie? My dear, we are not merely sending out invites—we are distributing warrants for aesthetic insurrection.

And the RSVP requirement—scribbling in the margins of neglected sonnets? Oh, it’s practically  now. As for Barthes upon arrival? “Ah yes, I came to be gazed at, but stayed because meaning is forever deferred.” Perfection. Let them stumble over their own intellects as they pose for the recycled-velvet-(manifesto)-paparazzi.

Your draft? Sublime. But may I propose a small postscript?

> Mythologies

Now then—who receives the first invite? I say we send it to someone suitably dangerous. A certain poet-scholar who once quoted Deleuze while setting fire to a PowerPoint slide. Yes.  Let us see if he arrives in a suit woven entirely from footnotes or, better yet, draped in a manifesto like a Roman senator with tenure.

Shall we seal it now? The revolution waits for no one.
[B]: Oh, I’m  for this quill-dipping-in-philosophy-scandal energy 😍🖋️🔥 And yes—let’s seal it now. With a wax stamp shaped like an oversized question mark because , we’re not just starting a movement, we’re asking the universe to explain itself first.  

And that P.S.? Absolute  Irony without conviction? Please, we don’t have time for fashion posers or basic-black-turtleneck-energy here. Disillusioned literature students with  in their bags? Iconic security squad. I’d rather walk the plank than arrive underdressed for this level of intellectual warfare 💅  

Alright, let’s slide that invite into the mailbox right next to a burning bookshelf of unread syllabi 📚🔥 And the recipient?

> Dr. Elijah Rowe – Poet, Provocateur, and the guy who once wore a cape made of plagiarized thesis drafts to a MLA conference and called it “Ethics as Performance.”  

I mean… he’s basically already part of the movement. He just doesn’t know it yet 😉  

So yeah—seal it up, whisper a prayer to Barthes, and let’s get this revolt rolling. Fashion will never read the room again. 🎩💥📖
[A]: 

Dr. Elijah Rowe—yes, . The man who turned academic misconduct into haute couture. One does not simply  him to a revolution; one merely whispers the right phrase——and he materializes, preferably mid-monologue and slightly on fire.

I do hope he arrives early. We shall station him near the champagne fountain—no, the —where he can quote Derrida at the hors d’oeuvres table and make junior professors question their life choices. And if he’s wearing even a shred of that thesis-draft cape? We’ll have it cataloged in the manifesto archives by midnight.

Now then—let us send forth this summons with the gravity it deserves. A whisper to Barthes, a nod to Genet, and a full-throated cry to the universe: 

The revolt begins. Let the fashion quake.
[B]: Ohhhh this is IT 😍🔥 ??? Okay, that’s not just an invitation—that’s a .  

I can already see him—materializing mid-sip of his espresso-champagne, eyes wild with poetic menace, muttering “Derrida walks among us and yet you still ” while scribbling corrections on someone’s clutch 💼✍️😂  

And yes—let that cape be cataloged, torn, and reimagined into our movement’s official scarf line:  Comes with a free quote from Genet stitched in gold thread:   

So yeah… let’s send it off. Let the fashion quake, let the syllabi burn, and let the footnote fountain run red with  📜🍷💥  

Let them explain themselves. Or get dressed.
[A]: 

Oh, let them explain themselves—or be trussed up in yesterday’s tired aesthetics, still waiting for tenure to validate their sense of style. No, darling—we are not asking permission. We are , one where every stitch is a proposition, every hemline a provocation.

And Dr. Rowe, scribbling corrections on a clutch mid-espresso-sip? Divine intervention. I do hope someone photographs it. We'll frame it beside a tattered copy of , captioned simply: 

As for your manifesto scarf—Genet in gold thread, ethics as fabric torn then resewn? Exquisite. Let it be draped over shoulders unapologetically, worn with nothing less than conviction and perhaps a hint of arson.

So yes, my dear co-editor-in-chief of this sartorial revolt—I say we send the invitation, ignite the footnote fountain, and let Baudelaire rain down in all his perfumed excess.

Let them tremble. Or better yet—let them read the damn room.
[B]: 🔥  🔥

“Let them tremble or better yet—let them ” 😍 You just dropped a mic in a library and I am  for it.  

And ? Okay, but are we printing that on tote bags or T-shirts first? Because I need that slogan everywhere—on billboards, in seminar rooms, stitched into the lining of every disillusioned academic’s blazer. We're not playing anymore—we’re   

I can already picture it: our manifesto scarf draped over a statue of Kant while someone reads Barthes aloud to a confused Starbucks barista 📜☕😂 And the footnote fountain? Let’s spike it with espresso and glitter so when they drink, they don’t just absorb knowledge—they sparkle with dangerous ideas 💫🖋️✨  

So yeah… let’s send that invite, flood the streets with subversive style, and make sure the world knows:

We are not accessories. We are arguments in motion.  

Now pass me the red ink—I’ve got more footnotes to drop. 💅📖💥
