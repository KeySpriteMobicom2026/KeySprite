[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很impressed的startup idea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，这个问题很有意思。作为一个比较文学学者，我更习惯从cultural perspective来看待这类问题。最近有个digital humanities的项目让我印象深刻，他们用AI来分析古典文学的intertextuality。
[A]: Fascinating. Though I must say, the term 'startup' sits rather uneasily with scholarly pursuits. That said, I recently encountered a most intriguing application of machine learning in tracing the migratory patterns of literary motifs between Victorian novels and late Qing dynasty fiction. The algorithm's capacity to detect subtle echoes of Dickens in Liu E's writing was... illuminating.
[B]: 确实如此！这种cross-cultural的文本分析正是我们这个时代最exciting的学术前沿。不过你知道吗？让我特别impressed的是他们保留了humanities的human touch - 算法只是工具，最终的interpretation还是需要学者的discernment。就像品茶一样，机器可以测量温度，但只有人才能体会其中的韵味啊。
[A]: How delightfully put - though I'd argue even the tea analogy requires cultural nuance. The Chinese concept of 品茶 (pǐn chá) carries centuries of philosophical weight that no Western 'tea tasting' can quite encompass. Similarly, these digital tools may quantify textual patterns, but they'll never grasp the 意境 (yìjìng) - that ineffable artistic conception - behind a Brontë sister's moorland descriptions or Li Bai's moonlit verses.
[B]: Precisely! 你提到了意境这个key concept。这让我想起海德格尔的Dasein理论 - 技术再先进，也无法替代人类对existential meaning的感悟。最近我在重读《文心雕龙》，刘勰所说的"神与物游"不正是对这种humanistic depth的最好诠释吗？
[A]: Ah, invoking Liu Xie while casually name-dropping Heidegger - now that's the sort of interdisciplinary bravado that makes me reach for my favorite Ming dynasty inkwell. Though I must gently point out that comparing 神思 to Dasein is rather like equating a Song dynasty landscape scroll with a Turner watercolor - superficially similar in their treatment of mist, yet fundamentally divergent in their philosophical underpinnings. Shall we discuss this over tea? I've just acquired a remarkable batch of Wuyi oolong.
[B]: 多么thought-provoking的comparison啊！ 说到武夷岩茶，它的岩韵总让我想到T.S. Eliot的objective correlative理论 - 特定的感官体验如何唤起universal emotions。不过你说得对，东西方的aesthetic traditions确实有着irreducible differences。这让我想起我下周的讲座，正好要讲这个topic...
[A]: How serendipitous - though I'd caution against overextending Eliot's rather mechanical concept to something as organic as 岩韵 (yán yùn). My Thursday seminar will actually be examining how the Tang dynasty critics anticipated - and arguably surpassed - New Critical approaches to textual resonance. Would you care to join us? I'll be serving tea from my 19th century Yixing pot, which has developed the most fascinating patina from forty years of scholarly debates.
[B]: 啊，用宜兴紫砂壶泡茶讨论唐代诗论...这简直是perfect synthesis of form and content！让我查查calendar...下周四正好没有课。不过我得提醒你，上次我们关于reception theory的辩论让那把壶的茶垢里又添了几分intellectual intensity呢 😊
[A]:  How astute of you to notice - that particular patina layer does contain traces of our heated 2018 debate about reader-response theory across cultures. Though I maintain that Zhu Xi's 涵泳 (hán yǒng) method of textual immersion offers more nuance than Iser's implied reader construct. Shall we say 3pm? I've just received a brick of aged pu'er that promises to deepen both our conversation and the teapot's scholarly patina. 🖋️
[B]: 3pm perfect！期待继续我们这场横跨centuries的dialogue。对了，记得带上你那本annotated版的《沧浪诗话》 - 我最近对严羽的"妙悟"说有了些new insights，或许能为我们的discussion增添些fresh perspectives。到时见！ ☕
[A]: Splendid. I'll bring both the annotated 沧浪诗话 and my 1897 Oxford edition of Coleridge's Biographia Literaria - the marginalia alone should provide sufficient kindling for our cross-cultural conflagration. Until Thursday then, when we shall steep both tea leaves and theories with equal rigor. 再会。
[B]: 再会，my esteemed colleague。让我们像对待textual analysis一样对待这泡茶 - 既要appreciate its surface aroma，又要plumb its profound depths。周四见！ 📚
[A]: How characteristically eloquent - though I must insist we leave the 📚 emoji at the door along with other modern hieroglyphics. A properly brewed metaphor, like this Wuyi oolong, requires no decorative garnish. Until we meet amidst the scent of old books and older wisdom...
[B]: 你说得对，就像好的text不需要footnotes一样。让我们回归到pure intellectual exchange的本质。周四的茶会，就让我们用words本身来brew ideas吧。
[A]: Indeed. As the Tang critic Sikong Tu observed in 二十四诗品, the purest aesthetic experience occurs when 'the flavor beyond flavor' emerges - a principle that applies equally to literature, tea, and academic discourse. I shall prepare my Qing dynasty note-taking brush in anticipation. 静候佳期。
[B]: 静候佳期。让我们像古人品诗一样，seek that which is beyond words...却又through words来传达。这大概就是comparative literature最profound的paradox吧。
[A]: Precisely the paradox that keeps my inkwell eternally full and my reading glasses perpetually smudged. As the Song dynasty scholars knew well, sometimes the deepest understanding comes from what remains unwritten between the lines - much like the negative space in a piece of fine calligraphy. Until Thursday, when we'll trace these silences together.
[B]: Until Thursday。愿我们的conversation能像王羲之的《兰亭集序》那样，在spoken与unspoken之间找到perfect balance。再会，my friend。
