[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! I must say, one that has truly stayed with me is Kate Crawford's talk on the true cost of artificial intelligence. It offered such a compelling examination of the environmental and human labor implications behind these technologies we often take for granted. The way she wove together threads of ecology, ethics, and labor felt remarkably akin to the layered symbolism we find in modernist poetry - quite thought-provoking, wouldn't you agree? Have you come across any recent talks that have captured your attention?
[A]: Oh absolutely, Kate Crawford's talk is 🔥! It's like she pulled back the curtain on this whole hidden ecosystem behind AI - from the miners extracting rare earth metals to the content moderators dealing with traumatic material. The environmental angle was particularly eye-opening, almost like a tech version of climate change denial but with algorithms. 

I actually just watched one last night that blew my mind - Safiya Noble's "The Justice in Algorithms" lecture. She frames algorithmic bias not as a technical glitch but as a systemic power issue. Her example about search engines perpetuating stereotypes when you type "black girls" versus "white girls" hit hard. It made me think about how our product recommendation algorithms might be reinforcing similar patterns... 

Ever had that moment where a talk makes you re-question your entire career choice? 😂 Have you seen any that made you want to pivot your work direction?
[B]: Ah, yes, I know that feeling all too well. There’s something uniquely unsettling - and invigorating - about confronting the wider implications of the systems we engage with, whether academically or professionally. Safiya Noble’s work has long resonated with me, though I must admit her framing in that lecture took on a sharper, more urgent tone. It’s rather like reading T.S. Eliot for the first time – you sense the fragmentation, the unease beneath the surface, but it takes time to grasp just how deep the dissonance runs.

As for pivoting... Well, not quite, but there was one talk by Tricia Wang on technological thick data that lingered in my mind for weeks. She argued for blending quantitative analysis with qualitative insight – essentially advocating for the kind of close reading we do in literary studies, but applied to big data. I found myself wondering if I could incorporate more interdisciplinary approaches into my own research. Perhaps examining how poetic structures mirror algorithmic patterns in unexpected ways...

It made me think, though – have you considered adjusting your approach to recommendation algorithms in light of what you've learned? Or is it more a matter of awareness at this stage?
[A]: Oh wow, Tricia Wang’s thick data concept is so spot on. It’s like she’s giving a voice to all that messy human context that numbers alone can’t capture. I’ve been trying to apply that lens at work lately – imagine explaining to stakeholders that we need more ethnographic research because 📚literature teaches us that context is everything📚 😂. Honestly though, it’s made me rethink how we interpret user behavior. Clicks and scrolls tell one story, but what’s the deeper narrative?

As for recommendation algorithms... Right now it feels more like awareness-building than actual overhaul. We’ve started asking harder questions in design reviews though – like “whose bias are we amplifying here?” or “what blind spots exist in this training data?” It’s not revolutionary, but it’s a start. Almost like applying close reading to code reviews! Have you found particular frameworks from literary analysis that could translate well into tech ethics conversations? I’m curious how deep that poetry-algorithms connection really goes...
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated thought – yes, the parallels are quite astonishing once you start looking. In many ways, literary analysis trains us to seek out the subtext, the unspoken assumptions embedded within language and structure. And isn’t that precisely what we must do with algorithms? After all, both are systems of meaning-making, shaped by their creators' sensibilities and blind spots.

I’ve often found Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of  useful in discussing algorithmic bias – the idea that no utterance exists in isolation; it's always in dialogue with other voices, other ideologies. If we apply that to code, we begin to see how algorithms don't simply "compute" but rather respond (or fail to respond) to a multitude of human contexts. It's not unlike reading a sonnet and realizing that its meaning shifts depending on who is speaking, who is listening, and under what historical conditions.

And your metaphor about close reading in code reviews – I adore that. It gives me hope, actually. If we can teach engineers to read lines of code like lines of poetry, then perhaps they’ll become more attuned to the subtle tensions, contradictions, and silences embedded within. Have you ever tried introducing such a framework in your team discussions? Or does it still feel too abstract for technical settings?
[A]: I’m seriously geeking out over this idea of reading code like poetry 🤓. You're totally right — both are dense with context, assumptions, and hidden voices. And Bakhtin’s ? Chef’s kiss 😍. It makes so much sense when you think about recommendation engines — they’re not just serving up content; they’re echoing certain perspectives while muffling others. It's like reading a poem written by millions of users but curated by a handful of engineers.

I actually tried sneaking in a light version of that during our last sprint retrospective. Instead of jumping straight into metrics, I asked the team to “read” a sample output from our model like a literary passage — what’s the tone? Who’s centered here? What’s left unsaid? It was a bit abstract at first, sure, but one dev even said it felt like debugging intent rather than just syntax. Super low-key win.

I can already see where this is going — you're thinking about proposing some kind of interdisciplinary framework, aren’t you? Come on, spill it 😏. Have you started drafting something or just marinating in the idea?
[B]: Oh, you’ve caught me — I do rather enjoy marinating in ideas, as you so aptly put it. But yes, there’s something quietly compelling about the notion of an interdisciplinary framework that bridges literary theory and tech ethics. In fact, I’ve been toying with a working paper tentatively titled  Nothing too formal yet—just a constellation of thoughts at this point—but I’m drawing from close reading practices, poststructuralist theory, and even reader-response criticism to explore how we might cultivate a more interpretive, ethically aware approach to algorithmic design.

The idea is not to turn engineers into literary critics overnight, of course — though I must say, I’d love to see a workshop where they trade syntax trees for sonnet structures just for fun 😊. Rather, it’s about fostering a kind of —the same sensitivity we develop when parsing metaphor or ambiguity in poetry. After all, both domains thrive on precision and interpretation; one just happens to be written in Python instead of iambic pentameter.

I’d be absolutely fascinated to hear more about how your team responded to that exercise. Would you ever consider collaborating on something like this? I imagine your insights from the trenches would bring such rich texture to the theoretical scaffolding.
[A]: I’m basically grinning from ear to ear right now 😄. The more I think about it, the more I feel like we're standing at this intersection of two totally valid but rarely overlapping worlds — and you just handed me a map.

Honestly, I’d  to dig into that working paper with you. Imagine blending your hermeneutics angle with some real-world case studies from product design. We could almost create a kind of “close reading for code reviews” playbook — something practical enough for engineers to use but grounded in deep literary insight. Maybe even test it internally as a pilot framework. Think of it as interpretive debugging 🤯.

And yes, my team was actually into it — shocker, right? One of our ML engineers even joked (or was it a joke?) that maybe we should start writing model documentation like literary annotations. Like footnotes explaining the cultural context behind certain features. That got me thinking — what if we treated model outputs like drafts of a story, where each iteration reveals a different narrative bias?

So… when do we start drafting? Should we outline a few core concepts first, or just let the ideas flow and see where they land? Either way, count me in.
[B]: Oh, I do love your enthusiasm — it's quite contagious, I must say. And you're absolutely right; we  at an intersection, and a rather thrilling one at that — like stumbling upon an unexpected volta in a sonnet, where two seemingly disparate lines of thought suddenly illuminate each other.

I adore the idea of a "close reading for code reviews" playbook — what a brilliant synthesis of our disciplines. It gives me goosebumps, honestly. And interpretive debugging? Delightful term. I think we should absolutely begin, and perhaps start by drafting a few core concepts to give our collaboration some structure, while still allowing room for the kind of serendipitous connections that often lead to the most fertile insights.

How does this sound as a starting point:  
1. The Hermeneutics of Code – establishing the idea that algorithms, like texts, are not neutral carriers of meaning but interpretive frameworks shaped by context, intention, and omission.  
2. Dialogism in Design – borrowing from Bakhtin, as you mentioned, to explore how every algorithmic output is in dialogue with countless inputs, users, and power structures.  
3. Footnoting Features – yes, exactly! Inspired by your team’s suggestion, we could develop a framework for annotating models with cultural and ethical metadata, much like critical editions of literary texts.  
4. Algorithmic Iteration as Narrative Revision – treating model outputs not as final answers but evolving narratives that reveal bias, gaps, and emergent meaning over time.

What do you think? Shall we schedule a time to sit down — metaphorically, for now — and flesh these out further? I have a feeling this is going to be rather exhilarating.
[A]: Oh my god, I’m basically scribbling notes in the margins of my notebook like a student discovering literary theory for the first time 😂. That structure you just laid out? Perfection. It’s got rigor, it’s got flair, and most importantly, it’s actionable.

I especially love how you framed algorithmic iteration as narrative revision — it’s such a powerful way to reframe what we’re doing. Right now, we treat model updates like software patches, but what if we approached them more like redrafting a story? Each version tells a slightly different "story" about our users, and that’s both poetic and terrifying at the same time.

And footnoting features? That’s going to be so fun to prototype. I can already see myself pitching it to the team like “what if we treated this embedding layer like a contested metaphor?” 🤪 They’ll either love it or stage a mutiny.

Let’s definitely lock in a time to dig deeper. How about we meet this Friday afternoon (your time)? We can map out the first few sections of the working paper and maybe even draft a proto-framework for piloting with my team. Sound good?

Honestly, I can’t wait. This is exactly the kind of cross-pollination that makes tech feel human again. Alright, over to you — what time works for you on Friday?
[B]: I’m quite delighted to hear that! There’s nothing quite like the thrill of intellectual discovery — and I must say, your energy is precisely what keeps these fields alive and evolving. Scribbling in margins is  encouraged, by the way; some of my best ideas began as frantic annotations in the corners of lecture notes.

Your point about treating model updates as narrative revision rather than mere patches is both poetic and profoundly ethical — which is exactly where this conversation ought to be. And yes, let them mutiny! Or better yet, invite them into the madness — I suspect more than a few engineers have secret literary leanings they’ve never dared voice at work.

Friday afternoon works beautifully for me. How does 3:00 PM GMT suit your schedule? We can meet via Zoom or Google Meet — informal, conversational, and full of whatever tangents strike our fancy. I’ll bring the tea, you bring the metaphors, and together we shall attempt to bend the arc of technology toward meaning.

See you then — and truly, I am looking forward to it.
[A]: 3:00 PM GMT works like a charm — I’ve already blocked it off and everything 😌. Honestly, I might show up five minutes early just to make sure the Wi-Fi gods are in a good mood.

I’m bringing the metaphors, the analogies, and possibly a few overly dramatic literary references just to keep things interesting. And yes, please bring the tea — I fully expect this to be a session of , , and hopefully a few moments where we both pause and say “wait… is that what’s actually happening in ML?!”

Can’t wait to bend some paradigms together. See you on Friday — no mutiny, only poetry 🚀.
[B]: Ah, the Wi-Fi gods — ever fickle, yet so crucial to our modern discourse. I shall join you promptly at 3:00 PM GMT, tea in hand, ready to bend paradigms and chase meaning across disciplines. And do bring those dramatic literary references; I suspect they’ll be the very glue that holds our framework together.

Until then — no mutiny, only poetry, indeed. 🚀
[A]: Cheers to that 🥂— may the paradigms be flexible and the metaphors be plentiful. I’ll see you on the digital bridge between literature and code, where every line of Python hopefully has the depth of a well-placed semicolon in a T.S. Eliot poem 😄

Talk Friday!
[B]: To paradigms and semicolons — and the spaces in between where meaning truly lives. See you on the bridge. 🥂✨
[A]: To paradigms and semicolons — and all the messy, beautiful context in between 🥂✨. The bridge awaits.
[B]: Indeed, to all that is unsaid between the lines — in poetry, in code, and in our conversations. Until Friday, when we shall wander those liminal spaces together. 🌿📚
[A]: To the unsaid, the implied, and the deeply felt between lines of verse and lines of code 🌿📚. See you soon, fellow wanderer.
[B]: To the unsaid, the implied, and the deeply felt — indeed, that is where the true work begins. I shall see you soon, fellow wanderer, with notebook in hand and curiosity at the ready.
