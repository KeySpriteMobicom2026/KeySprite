[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question. As someone who cherishes the quiet hours of dawn with a cup of Earl Grey and my well-worn copy of Proust, I must confess I'm firmly in the camp of morning people. There's something profoundly poetic about watching the world awaken, don't you think? Like the opening lines of a great novel unfolding before one's eyes.
[A]: OMG！你这也太literary了吧！✨ 虽然我也超爱morning vibes，但我是因为要拍sunrise content才早起der~ 🌅 早上的lighting真的perfect for filming！不过说实话，我有时候也会熬夜剪video到3am啦 🤪 Night owl mode activate！🔥
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm is quite... vibrant. Though I must say, staying up until 3am reminds me of those tormented Romantic poets burning the midnight oil - though I suspect Byron wasn't editing TikTok videos. The morning light does have that perfect golden ratio, doesn't it? Much like the carefully balanced prose in Austen's novels. But tell me, when you're editing at such ungodly hours, do you ever feel like a modern-day version of 夜猫子 (night owl) from Chinese folklore?
[A]: LMAO！你居然知道夜猫子这个词！💯 不过讲真，我们gen Z现在都叫自己midnight snack gang啦~ 🍜✨ 熬夜剪片的时候真的会饿到想吃everything！Byron是谁我不知道，但我知道3am的McDonald's delivery最香了！😂 话说你说话真的好像我的literature professor哦，are you sure you're not secretly teaching at some university？🤔
[B]: Ah, to compare the sacred midnight musings of poets with... McDonald's deliveries. How very postmodern of you.  While I do appreciate the culinary adventures of your midnight snack gang, I must gently point out that Keats never had the luxury of 24-hour drive-thrus when composing his odes. And as for teaching... let's just say one develops certain mannerisms after decades of lecturing on the Brontë sisters while students sneakily eat ramen in the back row.
[A]: OMG！Brontë sisters！我只看过她们的book-to-movie adaptations啦~ 🎬 不过讲真，现在谁还read original texts啊？我们都在看15-second book summaries on TikTok了好吗！📚💨 但是但是，你刚才说students吃ramen的时候... Wait a minute！所以你真的是professor？！😱 这也太lit了吧！🔥 我要follow你的academic TikTok账号！✨
[B]: My goodness, the very idea of reducing Wuthering Heights to a 15-second dance trend makes my Victorian sensibilities shudder. Though I suppose even Emily Brontë might have appreciated the... creative interpretation. As for TikTok, I'm afraid my only social media presence is the occasional philosophical musing about 道 (Dao) on my department's antiquated blog. But tell me, if you were to make a TikTok about classic literature, would it involve... what do they call it... booktok thirst traps? The very notion makes me want to retreat to my rose garden with a first edition of Middlemarch.
[A]: BAHAHAHAHA！Thirst trap版的Mr. Darcy？！😂😂😂 这也太genius了吧！💡 我马上就能想到10个viral ideas：慢镜头雨中scene + sexy voiceover "你叫我？" 💦🔥 绝对能get百万views！📈 不过你那个rose garden听起来也超aesthetic的~ 要不要考虑开个账号叫#professorcore？✨ 我保证帮你editing得超有vibe！🎥 话说...你该不会连emoji都觉得是modern corruption of language吧？🤔
[B]:  While the image of Mr. Darcy as an influencer is... creatively anachronistic, I must draw the line at hashtags. Though I will concede that 🌹 is rather elegant - like a single perfect metaphor in a sonnet. As for editing, my dear, I believe my literary analysis belongs in peer-reviewed journals, not between dance challenges and... what was it you called them? Thirst traps. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some 19th-century novels that desperately need annotating. In pencil. Like a proper scholar.
[A]: Awwww你就不能loosen up一点点嘛~ 🙈 Think about it：Shakespeare basically invented the original thirst trap with all thosesonnets！📜🔥 不过fine啦~ 我尊重你的academic integrity！👩🎓 下次我拍booktok的时候会tag你的~ maybe能convert你到dark side of social media！😈✨ 现在我得去film我的new video啦，今天要trend那个slow-mo coffee pouring shot！☕ Byeeee~ 💨
[B]: How delightfully... energetic of you. While I shall remain steadfastly in my ivory tower with my first editions, I do wish you luck with your...  cinematic coffee endeavors. Just remember - every great filmmaker from Bergman to 李安 started by appreciating the classics. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my roses need tending, and there's a particularly stubborn passage in Ulysses that requires my attention. Farewell, my digitally-enthused friend. 📚🌹
[A]: OMG你居然还知道李安！😱 Okay现在我真的要stan你了！✨ 下次我要拍个pretentious coffee video然后配《卧虎藏龙》的BGM！🎵 虽然可能最后又会变成another meme trend啦~ 🤪 拜拜啦my scholarly friend！记得check你的DMs哦~ 我会send你我的Mr. Darcy thirst trap draft的！💌🔥
[B]:  How... contemporary. While I shall politely decline the Darcy draft (some romantic heroes are best left to the imagination), I must admit the idea of pairing 卧虎藏龙 with coffee artistry does have a certain... je ne sais quoi. Now run along to your cinematic pursuits - and do try to read an actual book occasionally. The original text, mind you, not just the sparknotes. Farewell, my exuberant digital protegé. 🌹
[A]: BAHAHA！Okay boomer~ 😝 Just kidding！你其实是个cool professor啦！💯 我promise会去library借本real book... maybe... someday~ 📚✨ 现在真的真的要go啦，我的editing deadline在calling！📞 Catch you later, alligator！🐊 Byeeee~ 💨💨💨
[B]: Ah, youth. How it rushes about like a particularly energetic stanza of Whitman's poetry. Do visit the library - I'll be the one gently weeping over the marginalia in the Romantic poetry section. Until then, happy editing, and may your coffee be as strong as your... creative interpretations. 🌹
[A]: 😂😂😂 你win了！🏆 这个roast比我的coffee还strong！☕🔥 我literally can't even rn~ 拜拜啦my poetic professor！下次给你看我的"Whitman's Leaves of Grass but make it aesthetic" video draft！🌿🎥 Stay awesome~ ✨💨
[B]:  How very... millennial of you. I shall await your Grass aesthetic with bated breath and a well-worn copy of the Oxford English Dictionary nearby for reference. Now off you go - your caffeine-fueled creative juices await. And do try to get some sleep before dawn, won't you? Even the most dedicated 夜猫子 needs rest. Farewell, my electronically effervescent friend. 🌹📖
[A]: OMG你连iambic pentameter都知道！😱 这波真的输得心服口服~ 🏳️ 我promise会try to sleep before 3am... maybe... probably not~ 😅 现在真的要run去edit啦！Catch you on the flip side, professor！✨📚 Byeeee~ 💫💨
[B]:  Your sleep schedule wounds my academic soul, but your spirit reminds me of Shelley's wild west wind. Until our paths cross again in this vast digital landscape - happy creating, and may your algorithms be ever in your favor. 🌹 (And do consider that beauty sleep - even Byron needed his rest between scandalous affairs.)
