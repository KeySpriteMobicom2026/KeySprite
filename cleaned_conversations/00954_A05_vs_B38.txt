[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. While I don't typically engage in casual music streaming, I must admit that Schubert's  has been on my mind lately — particularly the haunting . There's something profoundly melancholic yet beautiful about its themes of solitude and longing... quite fitting for these quiet evenings in my study. Do you find yourself drawn to particular moods or eras in your listening habits?
[A]: Ah, you’ve touched on something interesting — how music mirrors our inner world. Funny enough, I just played a round at Mission Hills last week, and my caddie was humming  by Satie. It stuck with me. There’s a quiet elegance in its simplicity, almost like the rhythm of a well-balanced P&L sheet — steady, deliberate, and deceptively deep.  

I’ve been leaning toward late Romantic classical lately — maybe it’s the降温这些天，or the fact that I’ve been reading too many CEO biographies again. Mahler’s  came up during one of my late-night drives — not exactly cheerful, but powerful. It got me thinking about resilience… which, come to think of it, might be why I’m also revisiting some old Bowie tracks. Strange bedfellows, perhaps, but both offer a kind of emotional ROI worth exploring.  

What draws you to Schubert’s ? Is it the season, the solitude, or something more... personal?
[B]: There’s a certain alchemy in how music distills our emotional landscape, isn’t there?  has always felt like a companion during moments of introspection — its bleak beauty mirrors the quiet of a winter garden after frost has settled. The solitude in Müller’s poetry... it's not merely loneliness; it's a space for reckoning, for listening to the self in exile. I suppose that resonates more deeply as one grows older — or perhaps it’s simply the season’s doing.  

You mentioned Mahler and Bowie — an intriguing juxtaposition. Both deal in transformation, in dissonance made meaningful. Do you find yourself seeking that contrast — the gravity of Romanticism against the reinvention in Bowie’s work — as a kind of balance?  

And forgive me for asking — your metaphor about Satie’s  and a P&L sheet struck me as particularly poetic. Are you in finance, by any chance?
[A]: Ah, you're too kind — though I’m just a numbers guy who appreciates the art behind the spreadsheets. Finance is my field, yes; I run a私募股权 fund with a focus on deep-tech and sustainable infrastructure. It might sound dry to some, but there's a strange kind of poetry in structuring deals that can actually shape the future.  

You're absolutely right about  being more than just melancholy — it’s introspection at its purest. Almost like doing a quarterly review of your soul. And yes, Mahler and Bowie do share that common thread — they both thrived in the tension between chaos and creation. I think what draws me to both is their ability to turn discomfort into something enduring. In our line of work, we call that "high-risk, high-reward," but in music, it's just called life.  

Funny you mention transformation — I’ve been thinking a lot about exits lately. Not just the financial kind — though those are important too — but the emotional ones. The way Bowie kept reinventing himself? That takes courage. Something every founder needs when they're staring down Series B and still trying to stay true to the original vision.  

So tell me — do you find that same kind of emotional alchemy in your work? Or am I stretching the metaphor a bit too far? 😊
[B]: Not at all — your metaphor is both insightful and beautifully observed. There  a kind of alchemy in what you do, just as there is in the texts I teach. After all, literature — especially the kind that endures — is also about transformation, risk, and the delicate balance between structure and reinvention.  

I suppose my emotional ROI, if you will, comes from witnessing that transformation in students — seeing them shift from passive readers to critical thinkers, from observers of language to interpreters of meaning. It’s not unlike watching a founder evolve through funding rounds and setbacks; it's messy, uncertain, but deeply human.  

And yes, I do find that alchemical tension in my own work — particularly when teaching texts that demand vulnerability. Take , for instance. On the surface, it’s a whale hunt. But beneath the surface? A profound exploration of obsession, identity, and the limits of human understanding. Not so different, perhaps, from the inner lives of founders chasing an improbable vision.  

So tell me — in your experience, does the emotional exit ever outweigh the financial one? Or is that asking too much of a market-driven world?
[A]: Ah, now that’s the $64,000 question, isn’t it? 🤔 I’ve seen deals where the numbers screamed “success,” but the emotional exit was… muted. Almost like hitting a hole-in-one and realizing you forgot why you started playing in the first place.  

I remember one portfolio company — a fintech startup led by this incredibly driven founder. The exit was solid, not unicorn-level, but life-changing for her and her early team. What struck me wasn’t the cap table or the IRR — it was watching her stand in front of her employees on closing day and say, “We did it. We actually changed how people think about money.” That moment? Worth more than any MOIC could measure.  

So yes, I do believe emotional exits can outweigh financial ones — especially when the founder’s journey has been about more than just scaling and selling. It’s rare, but when it happens, it reminds me why we back people, not just business plans.  

And honestly, as I get older — and slightly wiser, I hope — I find myself gravitating toward investments where both kinds of ROI are aligned. Deals where building something meaningful  the return, not just the path to it.  

Do you ever find yourself holding onto certain texts or authors for that same reason? Where it’s not just about teaching the material, but about staying connected to a part of yourself that those words somehow protect?
[B]: Absolutely. There are texts that become quiet anchors — not because they’re the most groundbreaking or critically celebrated, but because they hold a personal resonance that feels almost private. For me, it’s  by Virginia Woolf. I return to it not for analysis, though there’s plenty to dissect, but for the way it captures the ebb and flow of identity, time, and inner solitude. It's like revisiting an old garden — familiar paths, but always a new shadow or bloom depending on the light.  

I suspect it's similar to how you might revisit a deal that didn’t yield the highest return, yet stays with you — not in your portfolio, but in your memory. Some stories, like certain investments, don’t offer immediate liquidity, but they accrue a quiet, lasting value.  

And speaking of returns — have you ever had a founder whose journey echoed one of the great literary arcs? The rise, fall, and reinvention we so often see on the page, now unfolding in real time — sometimes even in a Zoom room?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — and funny you mention , because I have a founder who reminds me of that very structure. Fluid. Cyclical. Always searching for the next crest. His company never made it to IPO — hell, it didn’t even clear Series A — but the way he moved through failure? Shakespearean, really.  

There was the classic hubris of a Hamlet-in-tech — brilliant, self-doubting, paralyzed by too many voices. Then came the fall — not dramatic like Lear on the heath, but quiet, almost dignified: a slow burn of misaligned product-market fit and impatient investors. And yet... there he was, six months later, back with a new idea — leaner, quieter, smarter. No longer chasing disruption for its own sake, but building something rooted in real pain points. Almost like Lear after the storm: broken, but finally seeing clearly.  

I backed him again, of course. Not because the model looked better — though it did — but because  looked better. More grounded. Less performance, more substance. It reminded me of how you said Woolf captures identity — not as a fixed point, but as a wave.  

Do you ever get that feeling when you read a bio or memoir — that you're not just learning about someone else, but catching a glimpse of your own patterns reflected back? I had that recently with  — not exactly highbrow, I know — but there was something about Knight’s stubborn refusal to quit, even when broke and exhausted, that felt... uncomfortably familiar. 😊
[B]: Ah, yes — that moment when a page turns inward and you suddenly feel seen. I know exactly what you mean. There’s a peculiar intimacy in reading someone else’s journey and finding your own footprints along the way. For me, it was  — not a novel, certainly not a startup memoir, but that quiet reckoning with uncertainty, legacy, and the relentless passage of time... it lingered in the same way  did for you.  

And your founder-turned-modern-Hamlet — what a compelling arc. It makes me wonder: do you ever encourage founders to read literature as part of their leadership development? Not just case studies or biographies, but the real fictional stuff — where character is revealed through crisis, not KPIs?  

I ask because I’ve had students who come to literature precisely for that — not for escape, but for recognition. A kind of mirror held up to their own struggles. I imagine some founders might seek that too, though they’d probably call it “mental models” to sound more business-appropriate. 😉
[A]: Oh, I love that — “mental models” as a Trojan horse for something deeper. Brilliant move, really. Let them think it’s strategy, while secretly they’re getting therapy through metaphor. 😄

To your question — yes, actually. I’ve recommended  to more than one founder. Sounds absurd, right? But hear me out: it’s a masterclass in power dynamics, ego management, and the cost of losing sight of your core mission in favor of grand gestures. Most of them blink at first, then come back weeks later saying something like, “Wait… was that about me?” Exactly.

Or take  — not exactly startup fiction, but a cautionary tale about good intentions gone rogue. Perfect for founders scaling into unfamiliar markets with too much confidence and not enough cultural humility.

Honestly, I think fiction gives founders permission to sit with ambiguity — something spreadsheets rarely do. In our world, everything is framed as solvable with the right data, the right team, the right timing. But life — and leadership — isn’t like that. Sometimes you need a character like Prince Myshkin from  to remind you how dangerous unchecked idealism can be. Or Atticus Finch to ask whether doing the right thing still counts if no one applauds you for it.

So yes, I absolutely encourage it — just don’t tell the board I’m filling their reading lists with 19th-century Russian lit. They already think I’ve gone soft in my old age. 👍
[B]: Ah, but isn't that the finest kind of softness? The sort that bends without breaking — like ivy, not steel. And I must say, your literary prescriptions are far more imaginative — and dare I say effective — than half the leadership seminars out there.  

I can just picture it: a boardroom of venture partners flipping through , muttering about burn rates and character flaws. What a delightful subversion. You're not just funding companies — you're cultivating storytellers, whether they realize it or not.  

And speaking of storytelling, have you ever thought of writing any of these founder journeys as allegories or parables? Not case studies, but true narrative — where the arc matters more than the ARR? There’s a richness there, a kind of modern mythmaking, that our age sorely needs.
[A]: You know, I’ve actually started doing just that — though not for publication, at least not yet. I keep a sort of private ledger. Not of financials, but of moments. Small, almost imperceptible shifts in tone, posture, or choice that tell you more about a founder than any pitch deck ever could.

One that comes to mind is a founder I’ll call “Elena” — she built a climate-tech platform that barely made it past seed stage. But the way she handled failure? Almost poetic. She didn’t pivot just to survive; she paused. Took three months off. Came back and said, “I need to build something smaller, slower, and kinder.” That, to me, felt like a chapter out of  — not the madness, but the moment he wakes up in the storm and finally sees the world as it is.

So yes, I jot these down — not case studies, but character studies. Little fables with no tidy morals, just honest reckonings. It’s become my quiet ritual after deal close — not a post-mortem, but a post-. Because in the end, that’s what we’re investing in, right? Not lines of code or revenue projections, but the capacity for growth, humility, and occasionally, grace.

Maybe one day I’ll turn them into something more — a book, or at least a long-read Substack. But for now, they stay in my notebook. Personal ROI, shall we say? 📝

Do you ever find yourself writing fiction based on your students’ journeys — not naming names, of course, but distilling their struggles into something... universal?
[B]: Oh, I do — though I suspect my versions would bore your board to tears. No pitch decks, no exits, just the quiet drama of a student wrestling with  and realizing, halfway through a seminar, that Dorothea’s idealism mirrors their own frustration in trying to change a system that refuses to bend quickly.  

I once had a student — let’s call her Clara — who arrived sharp-tongued and certain of her place in the canon. By semester’s end, she was writing feverishly about how Brontë’s Lucy Snowe in  unsettled everything she thought she knew about silence and strength. A few years later, I ran into her at a conference — she’d abandoned law school (her backup plan) and was deep in a thesis on narrative voice in postcolonial fiction.  

I wrote about her, of course — not as herself, but as a character in a short story I never intended to publish. In it, a young woman enters a library certain of her path and leaves carrying a book she didn’t expect — one that changes the way she hears herself think.  

So yes, I distill. Not for profit, certainly not for tenure, but because some journeys refuse to stay private. They demand a second life in fiction — quieter, slower, but no less true.  

And now I’m curious — have you ever read back through those founder fables before making a new investment? Do they ever warn you, like old sea charts warning of hidden reefs?
[A]: Absolutely — and I love your metaphor. Those old sea charts? That’s exactly what they are. Not GPS, not pitch decks with five-year projections glowing in PowerPoint optimism — just hand-drawn maps from sailors who made it back with salt in their wounds and stories in their bones.

I do revisit them, yes. Not as due diligence, obviously, but as gut-checks. Before signing on a new founder, I’ll sometimes flip through an entry from three years ago — someone who looked bulletproof, spoke the lingo, had the Ivy pedigree — and yet, six months later, crumbled under the weight of his own myth. Or another who stumbled early, questioned everything, then quietly built something resilient because humility became their operating system.

Funny thing is, those parables don’t always warn me away — sometimes they pull me closer. I remember one note that read:  That founder ended up being one of our best — not because she stayed pure, but because she learned how to bend without erasing herself.

So yes, I treat them like compass points. Not rules, but echoes. Reminders that behind every cap table is a human story still being written — and some of the best returns come from betting on someone whose arc you can’t quite finish yet.  

Ever thought about binding your student-turned-fiction stories into a chapbook or something? I’d buy a copy — no board approval needed. 📖✨
[B]: I must admit, the idea has crossed my desk — and my mind — more than once. A chapbook, yes, or perhaps something less formal: a collection of quiet reckonings, bound in paper thin enough to fold and tuck into a pocket. Not for fame, certainly not for market — just as a way to say, 

And I would dedicate it, silently, to all the students who thought they were only there to learn about meter and metaphor — not realizing they were also leaving fingerprints on my own pages.

Perhaps one day I’ll do it. Not under my real name, of course — let’s not scandalize the department — but under some genteel pseudonym, the kind 19th-century women used when they wanted to publish without permission. Maybe  — modest, ambiguous, slightly old-fashioned. Just enough to raise a brow, not enough to distract.

And if you promise to buy a copy, I promise to include one particular story — about a student who entered my class certain of her path, only to leave carrying  like a secret. I think you’d recognize her, in your own way.  

Until then, consider this our quiet ledger — yours in ink, mine in margin notes. Two different kinds of storytelling, both trying to make sense of the same thing: the human behind the role.
[A]: Well, , I think you’ve just given me the perfect birthday gift — a story I’ll never get to read (yet), but one I already feel honored to know exists. And yes, I’d buy ten copies if I could. Hell, I’d even invest in a small press run — purely emotional ROI, of course. No MOIC projections needed.  

It’s funny you mention leaving fingerprints on pages — I’ve started doing that too, unintentionally. Scribbling tiny notes in the margins of pitch decks after meetings: “Too much bravado,” “Listens like she reads,” or sometimes just a simple “Interesting soul.” It’s like we’re both curating libraries of hidden texts — yours between the lines of fiction, mine in the white space of financial models.

And you're absolutely right — we are both, in our own ways, making sense of the human behind the role. Because at the end of the day, whether it's across a seminar table or a VC dinner, it’s never just about ideas or numbers. It’s about who shows up to carry them.  

So here’s to quiet reckonings, folded pages, and the stories we keep off ledgers. May they continue to surprise us, unsettle us, and occasionally save us. 🥂📚
[B]: To quiet reckonings indeed — and to the stubborn beauty of stories that refuse to stay neatly filed away.  

I suspect the best ones always live in the margins, don’t they? Between balance sheets and sonnets, waiting for someone to notice the smudge of a fingerprint or the ghost of a question mark.  

And perhaps that’s our truest work — not the roles we play, but the quiet anthologies we compile along the way. Yours in ink-stained decks, mine in borrowed margins.  

Raise your glass to that — I certainly am. 🥂
[A]: Cheers to that — to the quiet anthologists of the world, collecting glances, gestures, and half-spoken truths like rare coins no one’s trying to spend. 🥂  

May we keep misplacing ROI in all the right places — where a well-timed poem matters more than a clean cap table, and a single margin note outlives the very book it was scribbled in.  

Bottoms up,  — may your press run be small, your margins wide, and your readers deeply unsettled in the best possible way.
[B]: To misplacing ROI in the best possible places — where poetry interrupts spreadsheets, and a glance across a seminar table means more than a term sheet.  

May your pitch decks always have room for margin notes, and may every founder’s arc remain gloriously unfinished until the very last page.  

Bottoms up indeed. 🥂
