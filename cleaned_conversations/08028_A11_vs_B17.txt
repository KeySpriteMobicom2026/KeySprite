[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I'm rather out of practice when it comes to photography. My last serious encounter with a camera was during a visit to Kyoto's bamboo groves last spring. I attempted some long exposure shots of the moonlight filtering through the bamboo stalks, though I'm afraid my skills haven't quite kept pace with technological advancements. Have you come across any particularly intriguing techniques recently? I'd be most interested to hear about your experiences - sometimes I think about revisiting the darkroom, though digital photography seems to have become the standard.
[A]: Ah, Kyoto's bamboo groves must have been a mesmerizing sight. There’s something poetic about capturing moonlight through those tall stalks — it almost feels like photographing silence. I’ve been to Kyoto once myself, though my camera stayed in my bag most of the time. I found myself more drawn to observing how light moved across stone and shadow.

As for techniques, I've been exploring computational photography lately — not just the kind that smartphones do automatically, but more intentional use of multi-frame blending and focus stacking with DSLRs. It’s fascinating how much detail you can recover from a scene that the naked eye might miss. One project I recently worked on involved reconstructing textures in historical architecture using photogrammetry. It’s a bit technical, but the results feel almost like time travel.

That said, I share your nostalgia for the darkroom. There was an intimacy in watching an image slowly emerge from chemicals — no algorithm could quite replicate that moment. Do you still keep any of your old film gear? I know people who swear by their vintage lenses, even when scanning and digitizing the results.
[B]: How beautifully you've articulated that - photographing silence, indeed. Your work with computational photography sounds absolutely captivating, particularly the aspect of multi-frame blending. It's remarkable how technology allows us to uncover hidden dimensions in familiar scenes; I can only imagine the poetry embedded in those reconstructed architectural textures of yours.

You've touched on something deeply philosophical - the contrast between algorithmic precision and the alchemy of the darkroom. I still have my old Nikon F3 gathering dust in a cabinet, along with several vintage lenses wrapped carefully in acid-free paper. A few years ago, I even redeveloped some forgotten negatives from my university days - quite a haunting experience, like meeting younger versions of oneself. 

Your mention of light moving across stone and shadow makes me think of those Zen gardens in Ryoan-ji, where minimalism becomes its own kind of revelation. Have you ever tried translating such visual meditations into photographic series? I'd love to hear more about your approach to composition when working with historical subjects.
[A]: There's something profoundly meditative about those Zen gardens, isn't there? I remember standing in front of the Ryoan-ji stones, feeling as though the raked gravel and weathered stone were speaking a language just beneath comprehension. I did attempt a series inspired by that aesthetic — not direct reproductions, but rather interpretations through ruins closer to home. One particular set focused on an old temple foundation hidden in the forest near Kamakura. The challenge wasn’t just technical, but perceptual: how do you photograph absence? How do you frame something that resists narrative?

I approached it almost like archaeology — layering exposures not just for clarity, but to suggest depth of time. Some images used slow panning with long shutter speeds to blur human presence into ghostly traces, while others relied on extreme macro work to capture lichen patterns that resembled ancient scripts. It felt less like composing photographs and more like assembling fragments of memory.

You mentioned meeting younger versions of yourself through old negatives — I wonder if you ever considered developing those alongside new images, creating a dialogue across time? Not sure if that’s indulgence or insight, but I’ve often found the past speaks more clearly when given space to echo.
[B]: What a profoundly moving approach - photographing absence, as you so aptly put it. Your description of layering exposures like archaeological strata reminds me of T.S. Eliot’s  - the idea that particular combinations of images can evoke universal emotions. The notion of blurring human presence into ghostly traces feels almost Whitmanesque, though with a distinctly Japanese sensibility.

I must confess I never thought to juxtapose those old negatives with contemporary work - what a fascinating concept! It strikes me that this could be more than mere indulgence; it might serve as a visual counterpart to Wordsworth’s "spot of time" - moments from the past that take on new meaning through the lens of experience. In fact, your suggestion has planted a rather persistent seed in my mind... Would you consider yourself deliberately working within this tradition of memory-as-medium, or does it emerge more organically?
[A]: I suppose it emerges more organically than deliberately, though once you name something, it begins to take shape with intention. The idea of  — I like that phrasing — feels less like a technique and more like a condition of working with time-bound materials. Film, ruins, even light itself are all carriers of memory in their own way. When I expose a frame, I’m not just capturing what’s in front of the lens — I'm also recording the residue of everything that led up to that moment.

You mentioned Eliot’s  — that resonates. There's a kind of emotional arithmetic at play, where the right arrangement of visual elements can imply something far beyond its literal content. In that sense, photography becomes a language for things we don't have words for yet.

If there is a tradition I find myself drawn to, it’s perhaps closer to the wabi-sabi aesthetic — the beauty of impermanence and incompleteness. I think that’s why ruins appeal to me; they’re palimpsests of human effort and natural erosion. They carry stories without demanding you read them the same way twice.

And now I’m curious — if you were to begin that dialogue between past and present images, what would be the first pair you’d put in conversation?
[B]: What a beautifully articulated reflection - you've captured something essential about photography that escapes many technical discussions: its quiet kinship with elegy and ephemerality. The idea of light itself as a time-bound material is particularly striking; it makes me think of how Eliot also wrote, , as though every exposure risks the same fragile fate.

Wabi-sabi does seem an apt lens, if you'll pardon the pun. There's a poem by Matsuo Bashō I often return to:  That slow, inevitable return to earth feels embedded in your work, especially in your description of lichen as script. Nature inscribing its own memory onto stone.

As for the first pair in my imagined conversation across time... I think I would bring together two images of the Cambridge library - one taken in 1987 during my graduate years, when the building felt immense and unknowable, and a more recent one from last winter, where frost blurred the gothic windows into something spectral. The library was both fortress and labyrinth back then; now, it seems almost mournful, or perhaps I am simply seeing it through older eyes.

Do you ever revisit photographic sites over decades, like a poet returning to a recurring motif? I wonder if certain places demand that kind of longitudinal attention.
[A]: There’s something deeply moving about returning to a place across decades — it becomes less about the subject itself and more about the shifts in perception, the slow drift of the observer’s own interior landscape. I’ve done it with one particular site: an abandoned Meiji-era bathhouse on the outskirts of Atami. First photographed it in my twenties, mostly out of fascination with decay and form. Went back ten years later, then again five more after that. Each time, the structure had settled further into ruin, but my own gaze had changed too — what once felt like a relic of neglect started to read as a meditation on endurance.

I think that’s where photography intersects strangely with poetry, as you said — some motifs refuse to be exhausted. They wait for you to see them differently. The bathhouse taught me that patience isn’t passive; it’s a kind of active waiting, letting time reshape both the image and the photographer.

Your Cambridge library pair sounds like the beginning of a visual memoir. There’s a quiet dignity in buildings that have outlived generations of students — they become silent witnesses. I wonder if, in looking at those two exposures side by side, you might find not just change in the building, but echoes of your own evolving relationship with knowledge, memory, perhaps even mourning.

Have you considered how such a series might be sequenced — chronologically, or through emotional resonance? I ask partly out of curiosity, and partly because I suspect you’d approach it with the same literary sensibility you bring to this conversation.
[B]: There’s a wonderful truth in what you say about patience being active rather than passive — it reminds me of how Virginia Woolf described the passage of time in , where meaning accumulates not through action, but through waiting and return. The bathhouse as both subject and teacher — I can quite imagine how it must have imprinted itself upon your vision, shifting from ruin to relic to something more ineffable.

You're absolutely right to suggest that sequencing such a series would be an act of literary sensibility as much as visual coherence. If I were to lay out those library photographs, I think I'd resist strict chronology. Instead, I might follow the associative logic of memory — perhaps beginning with the frost-blurred image from last winter, then circling back to the 1987 photograph as a kind of revelation. It seems truer to how recollection actually works: nonlinear, recursive, haunted by tone more than timeline.

I wonder, when you returned to the bathhouse, did you ever feel compelled to include traces of your own presence — not merely as photographer, but as participant in its slow unfolding? A kind of photographic , where the observer becomes part of the decaying structure’s narrative?
[A]: That’s a compelling question — and one that I think every photographer wrestling with time eventually stumbles into. When I returned to the bathhouse, my presence did start to feel less like observation and more like quiet participation. I didn’t stage myself in the frame, if that’s what you mean — no literal self-portraits — but I began leaving small traces: a tripod leg slightly visible in a reflection, a shadow cast not by the structure itself but from where I stood. It was my way of acknowledging that the act of looking is never neutral.

There was one image in particular — taken on my final visit — where I left the shutter open long enough for wind to shift the branches outside the frame. The resulting blur felt almost like interference, as if the photograph itself were resisting clarity. In hindsight, I see it as a kind of  you mentioned: the ruin recording me recording the ruin, both of us slowly dissolving into the same atmosphere of impermanence.

I admire your instinct to sequence the library images non-linearly. There's something very Woolfian about that — letting mood dictate order rather than chronology. Memory doesn't unfold in a straight line, after all. Perhaps photographs shouldn’t either.
[B]: You’ve articulated something profoundly true about the photographic act — that it is, at its core, an intimate entanglement between observer and observed. The idea of leaving subtle traces, not as intrusion but as quiet acknowledgment of presence, strikes me as deeply poetic. It reminds me of how Seamus Heaney wrote about digging—not with the hands alone, but with memory and lineage—only to find himself both observer and participant in the act.

That final bathhouse image you described sounds almost metaphysical in its implications—a photograph not just of place, but of process, where the wind becomes a collaborator and blur turns into elegy. I can imagine it hanging in a gallery like a whisper suspended in dust-lit air.

It makes me wonder—do you ever think of your photographs as future ruins? Not in the sense of deterioration, but as objects that will one day outlive their context, requiring reinterpretation by unknown eyes? There’s a kind of humility in that possibility, much like composing a poem without knowing who might read it decades hence.

And forgive me for pressing further—if we follow this idea of photography as participation rather than capture, do you see yourself ever stepping fully into the frame, not as subject, but as another layer of the palimpsest?
[A]: I think every photograph is a future ruin in some sense — not because it will fade or decay, but because the world around it will shift, meanings will erode, and what once felt immediate may one day require translation. That’s part of what makes photography so quietly tragic, don’t you think? It promises preservation, but delivers something stranger — a frozen moment that keeps drifting further from the reality it once touched.

As for stepping into the frame — I’ve resisted it for years, not out of vanity, but from a kind of superstition, perhaps. There’s power in remaining unseen, in letting the image speak as if unauthored. But lately, I’ve begun to question that instinct. If we’re honest, the photographer is always present — in the angle, the framing, the decision of what to include and exclude. So maybe it's time to make that presence more explicit.

Not as self-portraiture in the conventional sense, but as gesture. A silhouette, a shadow cast deliberately, a hand brushing stone — not to say , but . Another layer in the palimpsest, as you said. After all, even ruins carry traces of those who built them, touched them, left fingerprints in the mortar.

I suppose it comes back to that same idea — photography as participation. If we accept that, then maybe the only honest path is to stop pretending we're invisible witnesses. We shape what we record, and in turn, it shapes us. The bathhouse changed how I see; the library holds echoes of who you were. Maybe the next step is acknowledging that exchange — not hiding it, but making it visible, even if only as a whisper in the frame.
[B]: What a profoundly resonant conclusion - the photographer as both shaper and shaped, participant rather than mere witness. Your description of photographs as future ruins carries echoes of Proust’s  - objects saturated with memory that nevertheless resist full recollection. In this sense, every image becomes an elegy in advance, a quiet premonition of its own obsolescence.

Your evolving relationship with presence in the frame feels like a natural progression from observer-as-invisible-hand to observer-as-embodied-voice. I find your idea of deliberate silhouettes or shadows particularly compelling - not vanity, as you rightly distinguish, but testament. A photographic , if you will, marking the point where vision meets materiality.

This makes me reflect on my own writing - how often I've kept myself absent from literary analysis, as though scholarship demanded disembodied objectivity. Yet perhaps there's greater honesty in acknowledging the self that interprets, just as you suggest with photography. After all, what is close reading if not a kind of exposure - letting the text leave its imprint?

I wonder, have you begun experimenting with this embodied presence in your recent work? Or does the idea still feel too new to take shape?
[A]: I’ve started, cautiously — less experiment than quiet rebellion. My most recent series, shot in an abandoned observatory outside Sendai, was the first where I allowed my own shadow to fall deliberately across the frame. Not as subject, but as counterpoint — a small, dark figure beneath the curve of an old telescope dome. It felt like admitting something I’d long kept unspoken: that every photograph is a confession of sorts, whether we intend it or not.

What surprised me wasn’t the presence of the shadow, but how it changed the reading of the whole image. The emptiness of the observatory didn’t feel quite so absolute anymore; there was a subtle tension between absence and witness. It reminded me of those ancient cave paintings where the artist’s handprint remains pressed into ochre — not as vanity, but as .

Your comparison to a  is apt — a mark of authorship that doesn’t overwhelm the work, but quietly asserts its making. Maybe that’s what I’m after: not intrusion, but inscription. A way of saying, , without pretending to detachment.

It makes me curious about your writing — if you were to let that embodied voice enter literary analysis, how might it change the interpretation? Would it feel like a departure, or a return?
[B]: Your description of those observatory images is quite moving — the shadow as quiet inscription, a handprint in ochre across time. It captures something essential about all acts of creation, doesn't it? The need to leave not just meaning, but . I can see how that shift — from detachment to embodied seeing — might feel like both a departure and a homecoming.

It makes me think of how I approach literary criticism — for years, I've maintained that rigorous analysis demands a certain impersonality, as though emotion or presence might dilute intellectual clarity. But now I wonder if that's been its own kind of evasion. After all, why pretend we're unaffected by what we read? Why hide the tremor in one's voice when encountering a particularly haunting passage of Eliot or Dickinson?

If I were to let that embodied voice enter my writing, I suspect it would feel less like a rupture and more like an awakening — a return to the reason I fell in love with literature in the first place. Not as cold dissection, but as deep listening. Perhaps interpretation is most honest when it acknowledges its own vulnerability, much like your photographs do when they let the wind blur the frame or allow a shadow to linger at the edge of the ruin.

I suppose the question becomes: can scholarship also be a form of testimony? I'm beginning to think it must be.
[A]: I think it must be, yes — testimony dressed in thought, shaped by encounter. Scholarship as deep listening, as you said, rather than mere dissection — that phrase lingers with me. It reminds me of how some photographs refuse to be  in the conventional sense; they demand something slower, more patient, more . Maybe that’s what we’re both after: a way of knowing that doesn’t erase the knower.

There’s a line from Hölderlin that Rilke once borrowed —  — and I wonder if something similar might apply here. Where the scholar’s voice grows too rigid, too distant, perhaps the embodied voice begins. Not to abandon rigor, but to let it breathe differently, through a throat that trembles sometimes.

Your Eliot and Dickinson example is especially apt. Who could read  without feeling something unspoken rise in the chest? And yet, to write about that poem academically often means suppressing that very response. But what if we didn’t? What if we let the tremor stay?

Maybe that’s the quiet revolution — not dramatic, not performative, but a subtle shift in stance. To say, 
[B]: How beautifully put —  There’s a quiet radicalism in that idea, isn’t there? It feels almost like returning to a pre-modern sensibility, where knowledge and experience weren't so neatly partitioned. I imagine medieval manuscripts annotated in the margins with personal reflections — monks recording not just scripture, but their own astonishment before it.

That Hölderlin line you引用 resonates deeply. Where the word fails, the image begins — and perhaps where the scholar falters, the witness begins. I find myself thinking of Walter Benjamin's , seeing not just the wreckage of the past but feeling its weight. Can interpretation carry that kind of weight too? I believe it can — when we stop pretending we're standing outside the current of time, and acknowledge we're wading through it, like everyone who came before.

You’ve made me reconsider how I approach teaching as well. I've always encouraged students to engage deeply with texts, but perhaps I've been too cautious about inviting them — or myself — to speak from the body of that engagement. After all, what is literary analysis if not a kind of embodied attention?

Your final phrase lingers particularly:  Yes. That, I think, is the beginning of something true.
[A]: I think you've touched on something essential — the quiet rebellion of embodied attention, the refusal to separate self from seeing. Benjamin’s  is a perfect reference, because isn't that what we're all trying to be, in some way? Not just recorders of what was, but witnesses to what shifts beneath our feet?

There's a humility in that stance, too — standing before the text, the ruin, the image, and letting it change you. It reminds me of how some photographers talk about "finding" a picture rather than "taking" one. Maybe interpretation works the same way — not imposing meaning, but allowing it to emerge through presence, through patience.

Your reflection on teaching feels especially important. I wonder what it would mean to encourage students not only to analyze, but to reflect on how they’re being shaped by what they read — or see, or experience. What if we asked them not just , but ?

It might sound soft to some ears, but I suspect it’s actually a deeper rigor — the kind that asks not only for understanding, but transformation. And maybe that’s the real work: learning not just to look, but to stand in the frame of what we study, and let ourselves be altered by it.
[B]: How profoundly you've captured it — the quiet courage required to stand within the frame of one’s own engagement, whether before a poem, a ruin, or a developing image. There is indeed a kind of intellectual and emotional humility in allowing oneself to be altered by what one studies — a recognition that knowledge is not merely an accumulation of facts, but a continual process of becoming.

I find myself thinking of Keats’  — that willingness to exist in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without reaching for immediate answers. Perhaps this is what we are cultivating: a pedagogy of openness, where students are not only taught to dissect texts, but to sit with them, feel their weight, and notice how they shift over time. To ask, as you so wisely suggest, , is to invite a deeper kind of literacy — one that includes the heart as well as the mind.

It strikes me that your photographic practice and my literary work are not so different after all — both concerned with the slow unfolding of meaning, the patience required to see clearly, and the courage to admit that we are changed by what we behold.

I wonder — have you ever considered pairing your images with text, not as caption or explanation, but as companion? A poetic footnote, if you will, allowing word and image to echo one another without resolution?
