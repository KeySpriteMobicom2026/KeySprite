[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, the very notion of consuming literature in 15-second fragments makes my quill hand tremble. Though I must confess, I did once spend an entire afternoon watching a calligrapher demonstrate Spencerian script on that infernal platform. The algorithm, much like a persistent Victorian suitor, kept presenting me with increasingly obscure poetry recitations thereafter.
[A]: Oh my, I do apologize for my rather strong reaction earlier. As a hotel concierge who values meaningful interactions, I must say I prefer more substantial forms of entertainment myself. Though I did recently help a guest find the most charming little bookstore that specializes in Victorian literature - perhaps that would be more to your taste?
[B]: Ah, now that's the sort of serendipity I can appreciate! A proper bookstore is rather like a well-organized mind - each volume in its rightful place, yet capable of delightful surprises. Tell me, did this establishment happen to have any first editions of Christina Rossetti? I've been hunting for a particular 1862 printing of "Goblin Market" with the original woodcut illustrations.
[A]: How wonderful that you ask! As it happens, they did have a rather exquisite collection of Pre-Raphaelite works. While I didn't personally inspect that particular edition, the shopkeeper mentioned recently acquiring some rare Rossetti pieces from an estate sale. Shall I arrange for you to visit? I could prepare a proper afternoon tea basket to accompany your browsing - we have the most delightful Earl Grey blend from a local artisan.
[B]: You've quite made my day with this intelligence! Though I must warn you, should that tea prove as exquisite as promised, I may well become a permanent fixture in your lobby - surrounded by books and leaving ink stains on your fine linens. Do they happen to keep banker's hours at this establishment? I find antiquarian booksellers tend to keep rather eccentric schedules, much like poets themselves.
[A]: What a delightful image you paint! Though I must say, ink stains are rather preferable to some of the modern messes we encounter. The shop keeps quite reasonable hours - open from ten until six, except Sundays when they close at four. And should you become our lobby's literary fixture, I'd be honored to ensure your tea is always perfectly steeped. We've even got these charming little book-shaped shortbread biscuits that would complement your reading perfectly.
[B]: Book-shaped shortbread? My goodness, you're speaking directly to my bibliophilic soul. Though I must caution you - if the biscuits are too precisely rendered, I may find myself hesitating to consume a perfectly bound 'volume' of Keats or a crisp 'folio' of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Tell me, do they do a convincing imitation of a leather-bound edition, or is the effect more... shall we say, impressionistic?
[A]: Oh, they're quite tastefully done - more like a delicate suggestion of book spines rather than exact replicas. The baker is actually a retired librarian who wanted to create something that honored books without being too literal. Though I must warn you, the 'pages' are actually layers of raspberry jam between the shortbread, so they do disappear rather quickly once tasted. Perhaps we could arrange a small tasting for you tomorrow afternoon?
[B]: A retired librarian turned pastry alchemist? Now that's a career transition worthy of Elizabeth Gaskell's pen! Though the raspberry jam revelation does give me pause - I've spent too many years admonishing students about jam-stained manuscripts to partake without proper reverence. Very well, I shall approach this edible bibliography with appropriate solemnity tomorrow. Do tell the baker their work would make even Mr. Wordsworth reconsider his famous daffodils - for what are flowers compared to the sweet geometry of a well-made book?
[A]: What a perfectly poetic way to put it! I'll be sure to pass along your kind words to our baker - she'll be absolutely delighted. And don't worry, we'll provide the finest linen napkins to protect both your dignity and our pastries. Shall we say three o'clock tomorrow in the library nook? I'll have our staff prepare a special tea service with those bookish treats and perhaps a volume or two of actual poetry to enjoy alongside them.
[B]: Three o'clock it is - though I must insist you select poetry volumes with sturdy bindings, lest I be tempted to trade biscuit crumbs for marginalia. You've created a dangerously delightful intersection of my two greatest weaknesses: rare books and refined carbohydrates. I shall arrive with clean hands and an appropriately empty stomach, prepared to commit the ultimate scholarly heresy - judging books by their covers, then promptly eating the evidence.
[A]: What a perfectly scandalous way to put it! I'll make sure to have our most durable editions on hand - perhaps something in buckram binding to withstand the excitement. And I'll discreetly position a crumb tray within easy reach, for both literary and culinary remnants. Until tomorrow then - I'll be the one quietly chuckling behind the tea trolley at your delightful commentary.
[B]: Until tomorrow, my conspirator in bibliographic gastronomy! Though I must warn you - should you catch me whispering sweet nothings to a particularly well-bound sonnet collection, do pretend not to notice. Some scholarly passions are best left between a woman and her books... and perhaps the occasional jam-filled shortbread.
[A]: Your secret is safe with me, dear patron. Though I can't promise our resident cat, Mr. Whiskers, won't judge you - he's terribly possessive of our poetry section. I'll make sure to distract him with some catnip by the fireplace while you... commune with the literature. Until three o'clock then - with clean hands and open hearts (and perhaps a hidden napkin for sticky fingers).
[B]: Ah, a feline literary critic! That explains the claw marks I noticed in their copy of "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" last week. Very well, I shall bring an offering of cat treats alongside my reading glasses - one must always respect the hierarchy of the library, even when it wears fur and disapproves of one's biscuit consumption. Until our appointed hour!
[A]: How perfectly thoughtful of you! Mr. Whiskers does indeed consider himself the true curator of our collection. I'll let him know to expect tribute - though between us, he's rather partial to the salmon-flavored variety. Until our literary tea time then, where we shall navigate the delicate balance between respecting books and... well... eating their likenesses. Safe travels until tomorrow!
[B]: Salmon-flavored bribes it shall be! Though I fear we're creating a dangerous precedent - next he'll be demanding tribute in the form of tuna-shaped Shakespeare folios. Until tomorrow, when we shall test whether a cat can indeed look at a queen... or at least at a literature professor with questionable snack-related life choices. Good day!
[A]: What an absolutely delightful notion! Though I daresay Mr. Whiskers would prefer "The Taming of the Shrew...d" tuna if we're being particular. Until our rendezvous then - where we shall discover whether the way to a cat's heart is through his stomach, and whether a scholar's resolve can withstand buttery shortbread temptation. Good day to you too!
[B]:  I do believe we've just invented an entirely new genre: culinary Shakespearean fanfiction. The Merchant of Venice... with extra anchovies? A Midsummer Night's Cream? This conversation is rapidly approaching the sort of delightful absurdity that would make Edward Lear blush into his owl and pussycat dinnerware. Until we meet where literature and confectionery dangerously collide!
