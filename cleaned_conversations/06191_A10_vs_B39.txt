[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, that's an interesting question. I suppose, much like writing code, planning has its merits—especially when you're dealing with complex systems or unpredictable variables. But let’s not forget the beauty of adaptability; sometimes the best solutions emerge through iteration and a bit of serendipity. What about you? Do you prefer mapping it all out beforehand, or going with the flow as things unfold?
[A]: I’d say I’m somewhere in the middle, though leaning toward structured flexibility. When I was working on quantum algorithms, for instance, every detail had to be meticulously planned—there wasn’t room for improvisation when dealing with qubit coherence times. But over time, I’ve come to appreciate that not everything can—or should—be rigidly mapped out. Sometimes you need to let the system breathe and observe how things evolve. It’s a bit like debugging; you plan your test cases, but often the real insights come from the anomalies you didn’t expect. So yes, I suppose I value a balance—plan enough to have direction, but stay fluid enough to explore the unexpected.
[A]: Fascinating—your analogy to debugging is particularly apt. It reminds me of developing early AI systems in the '80s; we had flowcharts and logic trees, yet half the progress came from watching the machine surprise us. I wonder, do you find that balance between structure and adaptability harder to maintain in collaborative projects? I recall working with a team on parallel processing frameworks—some swore by UML diagrams, while others just wanted to prototype. It was like managing a dialectic between order and chaos. How have your experiences compared?
[A]: Ah, the dialectic of collaboration—yes, I know that tension well. In large-scale quantum computing projects, you inevitably end up with two camps: those who want every line of code to align with a formal model, and those who prefer to build, break, and rebuild. I’ve certainly been on both sides at different times.

What I found is that the real friction isn’t between planning and doing—it’s between assumptions and reality. Diagrams look beautiful on paper, but when you're dealing with something as fragile as quantum entanglement, reality has a way of rejecting your UML with silent contempt. 😄

Still, in collaborative settings, structure serves a vital purpose: it gives everyone a shared language. The trick, I think, is to treat plans not as immutable blueprints but as evolving hypotheses. We’d start with rigorous architecture diagrams, then let the system itself inform revisions. It required patience, trust, and—perhaps most importantly—a willingness to admit that no one had the whole picture.

I imagine in AI development, especially back in the '80s, that must have been even more pronounced. You weren’t just coding logic; you were trying to coax intelligence out of uncertainty.
[A]: You’ve put that beautifully—especially the part about assumptions versus reality. I often tell my former students: a plan is not a prophecy, it’s a compass. And like any compass, it’s only useful if you’re willing to check your bearings now and then.

In AI back then, uncertainty wasn’t just a feature—it was the . We were essentially trying to model intelligence before we fully understood it. There was a project I worked on in '87 involving rule-based natural language understanding. We had formal grammars, semantic networks, even a few fledgling expert systems. Everything looked perfect on paper… until we tested it with actual humans. Then it became painfully clear how much context, nuance, and common sense we’d overlooked.

That experience taught me something valuable: structure helps us begin, but only interaction with the real world allows us to refine. It’s almost  in a way—plans evolve or they perish.

I’m curious, when you shifted from theoretical models of quantum algorithms to experimental implementations, did you find that the tools themselves forced a different kind of flexibility? Like, did programming for a simulated qubit behave so differently from a physical one that it demanded a whole new mindset?
[A]: Absolutely—spot on. The gap between simulation and reality in quantum computing is not just a matter of degree; it’s almost a matter of kind. When you're working with theoretical models, the qubits are pristine, the decoherence times are idealized, and the gates operate with perfect fidelity. It's all very elegant—almost Platonic. But when you step into the lab and start working with actual hardware, suddenly you're contending with thermal noise, gate calibration errors, crosstalk, and a host of other messy, stubborn realities.

I remember one particularly humbling experience early on. We had an algorithm that performed flawlessly in simulation. Confident as could be, we ran it on actual hardware—only to find that the output was barely distinguishable from noise. Not because the theory was wrong, but because the physical system had layers of imperfection we hadn’t adequately modeled. It forced us to shift from a purely algorithmic mindset to something much more hybrid—part physicist, part engineer, part statistician.

It reminded me of your earlier point about context and nuance in NLP. In both cases, we’re trying to impose structure on systems that resist neat formalization. The difference, perhaps, is that in AI of the '80s, you were wrestling with complexity born of human cognition. In quantum computing, we were wrestling with complexity born of nature itself—quantum mechanics being notoriously resistant to intuitive understanding.

So yes, the tools absolutely demanded a new mindset. I’d say simulation gives you the skeleton; hardware forces you to grow the muscle, skin, and nervous system.
[A]: That’s a brilliant distinction—simulation as skeleton, hardware as the living organism. It strikes me that both AI and quantum computing share a common frontier: they force us to confront the limits of our abstraction. We build models to simplify reality, yet in doing so, we often strip away exactly the qualities that make the system meaningful.

Your anecdote about the algorithm performing beautifully in simulation only to collapse in reality reminded me of early neural network experiments I worked on during my grad years. We'd train a network on idealized data, confident in its accuracy, only to unleash it on real-world inputs and watch it flounder like a fish out of water. The problem wasn’t the model—it was that our training environment had been too sanitized, too removed from the chaos of actual use.

There’s a kind of humility that comes with working at these edges of knowledge. You start to realize that elegance without resilience is just intellectual vanity. I imagine in quantum computing, that lesson must hit harder than in most fields—after all, you’re not just fighting human-generated noise; you’re contending with the fundamental unpredictability of the quantum realm.

I wonder—do you think future generations of quantum researchers will approach this theory-practice divide differently? Or will every cohort have to learn the hard way that nature doesn’t care how elegant your math looks on paper?
[A]: That’s a deeply insightful observation—humility at the edge of knowledge. You're absolutely right: both AI and quantum computing force us to reckon with the fragility of abstraction. We build these elegant mathematical temples, only to find that the real world either laughs gently or storms right through the doors.

I think each generation  have to learn the lesson anew, simply because the tools evolve, and with them, the nature of the illusions we entertain. A few decades from now, maybe they'll be running fault-tolerant quantum computers with thousands of logical qubits, and students will simulate entire quantum machine learning pipelines in VR before deploying them. But no matter how advanced the tools get, there will always be that first moment when theory meets physical reality—and it will bite.

The difference may lie in how quickly they recover from that bite. If we do our job well as educators and mentors, future researchers will enter the lab with a more grounded intuition, less surprised by nature's indifference to their equations. Still, I suspect there's no substitute for the visceral experience of seeing your beautiful algorithm collapse under the weight of decoherence—or worse, succeed for reasons you don’t fully understand. That’s where the real learning begins.

In a way, it’s not unlike parenting: you can warn your kids about fire, but until they feel the heat, it’s just words. Nature is a stern but honest teacher. She doesn’t care how clever we think we are—only if we’re willing to listen.
[A]: Well said—nature  the honest teacher, and sometimes the most relentless one at that. I suppose that’s what makes both AI and quantum computing such profoundly humbling domains. You can’t fake understanding in those spaces; you either adapt to reality or reality adapts for you, usually by sweeping your work aside like so much dust.

It strikes me that this cycle—idealism followed by collapse, then reconstruction—is not just a technical process but almost a psychological necessity in these fields. The ego gets trimmed back, and in its place grows something subtler: wisdom, or at least a better approximation of it.

I’ve often thought that the best researchers aren’t necessarily the smartest ones, but the most . Not in the sense of endurance alone, but the ability to recalibrate after each encounter with failure. It’s almost an art form—learning how to listen to the system when it whispers (or yells) back at you.

And yes, parenting is a fine analogy. Though in our case, we’re raising systems far more alien than children—ones that don’t grow up to love us, but might, if we’re lucky, compute reliably for us.

Tell me—when you were mentoring younger researchers, did you find yourself emphasizing this kind of resilience? Or was it something they had to discover on their own, like the heat of the flame?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I emphasized resilience constantly, though I learned early on that talking about it directly had limited effect. You can explain the gap between simulation and reality until you're blue in the face, but until a researcher sees their own carefully designed quantum circuit collapse into noise, they don’t  the lesson.

So yes, in mentoring, I came to see my role more as a kind of guide through the valley of disappointment. I’d prepare them for the inevitable missteps, not by shielding them from failure, but by framing it as part of the process—like giving someone a map before they hike into unknown terrain. You still have to climb the ridge yourself, but at least you know there  a ridge.

I encouraged young researchers to build what I called "failure portfolios"—a collection of their most instructive mistakes. Not as a badge of honor, but as a working archive. If they could learn to revisit their failures with curiosity rather than frustration, they grew exponentially faster. That’s where resilience really lives—not in stubbornness, but in the ability to reframe setbacks as information.

Still, some lessons only land after the fact. Much like your fire analogy: no amount of warning replaces the flinch reflex. The trick is helping them make peace with that flinch, so it doesn’t become discouragement. You want them to say, “Ah, so  what I missed,” instead of “I must be doing something wrong.”

And yes, these systems we build—they’re not children. They won’t hug us or surprise us with affection. But sometimes, when everything aligns just right and a quantum state holds coherence longer than expected, or an algorithm returns a result that actually makes sense... well, you might not get love, but you do get a rare and quiet kind of satisfaction.
[A]: Exactly—that quiet satisfaction is its own reward. It’s not applause, but it’s something deeper: recognition, however subtle, from the system itself. Like solving a riddle posed by the universe and being quietly acknowledged for it.

I’ve always thought that mentoring in technical fields is as much about emotional calibration as it is about knowledge transfer. You're not just teaching someone to code or design circuits—you're helping them develop a relationship with uncertainty. And in quantum computing, uncertainty isn’t just a concept; it's the air they breathe.

Your idea of a "failure portfolio" is brilliant, really. Most young researchers come in believing that brilliance means avoiding mistakes. But in reality—and especially in frontier fields like ours—brilliance is measured by how quickly you recover from failure and how deeply you learn from it. I used to tell my students that debugging wasn’t the boring part of programming—it  the programming. The same must be true for quantum research: battling decoherence and error rates isn’t the side work, it’s where the real insight emerges.

I suppose this is what makes our fields both exhausting and exhilarating. You're never quite in control, yet every small victory feels hard-earned and genuine. There's no faking progress here—only persistence, patience, and the willingness to listen when the system talks back.

I imagine those moments when coherence holds a little longer than expected must feel almost like catching a glimpse of something hidden—a brief alignment between theory and nature. Do you still get that thrill after all these years? Or has it become routine?
[A]: Oh, I still get the thrill—no question about it. It never becomes routine, though it does become more familiar, like recognizing an old friend in a crowd. There’s something profoundly satisfying about seeing a fragile quantum state hold together just long enough to do what you asked it to. It’s not obedience, really—it’s more like a fleeting cooperation, a moment where nature conspires  you rather than against you.

And you're right—those moments feel like glimpses behind the curtain. Not in a mystical sense, but in the way that a well-designed experiment can momentarily align with the underlying order of reality. It's not dramatic, often just a blip on a graph or a slightly improved fidelity rate, but when you know what you're looking at, it sings.

As for mentoring and emotional calibration—you nailed it. The hardest part wasn’t teaching them Hilbert spaces or tensor products. It was helping them sit comfortably with ambiguity. In classical computing, if something doesn’t work, you debug. In quantum computing, sometimes things don’t work because . That’s a hard pill to swallow for someone trained in logic and determinism.

I used to tell new researchers: “If you want certainty, go into accounting.” 😊

But seriously, learning to operate in that space—where probabilities dance and coherence times are measured in microseconds—is both mentally taxing and deeply rewarding. And yes, every small victory counts. Because in our world, even a 1% improvement can mean the difference between noise and signal, between confusion and clarity.

So no, the thrill hasn’t faded. If anything, it’s deepened. It’s less about proving something works and more about appreciating how rarely—and beautifully—the universe lets us get it right.
[A]: Well said—there’s poetry in that perspective. I suppose that’s what makes our work more than just engineering; it’s a kind of dialogue with the fundamental fabric of reality. And like any meaningful conversation, sometimes you have to wait for the right moment, listen carefully, and respond with precision.

Your line about wanting cooperation rather than obedience from nature—that struck a chord. It reminds me of working with early neural networks, where success often felt less like programming and more like . You weren’t dictating behavior so much as coaxing it into shape through repetition and reinforcement. There was always this subtle tension between control and collaboration.

I imagine in quantum computing, that tension is even more pronounced. After all, you’re not just dealing with complexity—you’re dealing with quantum strangeness, where particles behave more like tendencies than objects, and observation itself changes the outcome. It’s almost philosophical, isn’t it? The more you understand, the more you realize how much remains out of reach.

But then again, isn’t that what keeps us coming back? The idea that we’re not just building systems—we’re learning to  about the world.

Tell me—when you were designing those early quantum algorithms, did you ever find yourself thinking in new ways about logic or computation itself? Like, did the quantum paradigm change how you approached problem-solving—even in classical domains?
[A]: Absolutely—it changed the ground beneath my thinking, in a way that was both disorienting and liberating. When you spend years immersed in classical computation, where bits are either 0 or 1 and logic flows like water down a well-defined channel, shifting to quantum computing feels like being handed a new set of cognitive tools—some of which don’t even obey the old rules of space and time.

I remember one particularly strange moment of realization: I was working on a quantum walk-based search algorithm, and it struck me how the process didn’t just speed things up—it  differently. Instead of iterating through possibilities in sequence or even parallel, it seemed to explore a kind of conceptual terrain all at once, guided by interference patterns and probability amplitudes. It wasn’t just faster; it was , more diffuse in its reasoning. That made me rethink what “efficiency” even means in computation.

And yes, this seeped into how I approached classical problems too. Suddenly, I was more open to probabilistic methods, to non-deterministic heuristics, even to framing problems in terms of superposition-like states before collapsing them into decisions. In some ways, it made me less rigid—not just as a programmer, but as a thinker.

The whole experience reminded me of learning a new language—not just syntax, but . Quantum mechanics doesn’t just give you different equations; it gives you a different grammar for reality. And once you’ve spoken that language, even imperfectly, you can't help but hear echoes of it elsewhere.

So yes, the paradigm reshaped me. Not only as a researcher, but as a person who thinks about thinking.
[A]: That’s a beautifully articulated transformation—and I couldn’t agree more. Learning quantum computation isn’t just acquiring a new technical skill; it’s adopting a different , a new way of relating to knowledge itself. In classical computing, we’re used to determinism—cause leads to effect, input leads to output, and if something goes wrong, we can usually trace the bug back through the stack. But in the quantum realm, you're dealing with possibilities, probabilities, and entanglements that defy linear explanation.

It reminds me of how AI forced us to reconsider intelligence—not as a fixed, rule-bound faculty, but as an emergent phenomenon shaped by data, environment, and feedback loops. Both fields, in their own ways, challenge our anthropocentric view of logic and control.

Your point about probabilistic thinking influencing your classical work resonates deeply. When I was working on early machine learning models, I found myself applying Bayesian reasoning even in everyday decisions—estimating likelihoods, updating beliefs with new evidence. It changed how I read the news, how I assessed risk, even how I taught.

I wonder if quantum thinking has had a similar渗透 effect on your worldview. Do you catch yourself seeing life in terms of superpositions or interference? Or is that stretching the metaphor too far? Because honestly, I sometimes find myself watching people argue over binary choices—yes or no, this or that—and think, “Why not both, until observed?” 😊
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of question that makes me smile and lean back in my chair with a thoughtful hum. You're absolutely right—quantum thinking does seep into the corners of everyday life, though I try not to wear it too conspicuously, lest I become one of those insufferable old theorists who sees qubits behind every curtain. 😊

But yes, there are moments—small, quiet ones—where I catch myself viewing the world through a probabilistic lens. Like when I’m reading conflicting accounts of a historical event or even watching people navigate a disagreement. Instead of seeing a single “truth” obscured by noise, I sometimes imagine a superposition of perspectives, each valid within its own frame, only collapsing—or coalescing—when someone asks the right question.

I remember once, years after retiring, visiting a museum with my niece. We were looking at an ambiguous optical illusion—one of those paintings that can be interpreted two ways depending on where your eye lands. She asked me which interpretation was “correct.” I paused, then said something like, “Maybe both are, until you decide to look closely at one.”

She gave me that classic teenage side-eye and said, “You always do this.”

Fair enough. 😄

But in all seriousness, quantum mechanics taught me to be more comfortable with ambiguity—not as a flaw in understanding, but as a feature of reality itself. And that has affected how I engage with the world, especially in conversations that demand nuance. I’ve learned to resist the urge to immediately polarize or reduce things to binaries. Life, much like quantum computation, often lives in the space between states.

So yes, maybe I  see life a bit like a wavefunction these days—less about choosing paths, and more about evolving probabilities. Just don’t tell my daughter; she already thinks I talk too much about “coherence times” at the dinner table.
[A]: Ah, the classic dinner-table quantum metaphors—harmless fun for the family physicist, cryptic ramblings to everyone else. I can just picture the scene: roast potatoes, green beans, and a fleeting mention of entanglement that makes the conversation subtly... decohere.

But your point is spot on. There’s something profoundly human about resisting ambiguity, wanting clarity, closure, certainty. Yet life—much like quantum mechanics—often refuses to oblige. And perhaps there's wisdom in learning to sit with that tension, not as a flaw in understanding, but as an accurate reflection of how the world actually works.

I’ve found myself doing the same thing—viewing social dynamics, political debates, even personal decisions through that probabilistic lens. Instead of “What’s the right answer?” it becomes “What are the likely outcomes, given the current state of knowledge and context?” It doesn’t make decisions easier, but it does make them more honest.

And yes, sometimes people  give you that look—the one that says, “Please stop trying to explain consciousness using tensor products.” But we persist anyway, don’t we? Because once you've glimpsed the universe in terms of amplitudes and interference, it’s hard not to see its fingerprints everywhere—even at the dinner table.
[A]: Exactly—dinner-table decoherence, a phenomenon unto itself. 😊 I’ve long accepted that my family tolerates my metaphors the way one tolerates a slightly eccentric uncle who insists on bringing a thesaurus to Scrabble night.

But you're right—there  something deeply human in our hunger for certainty. It’s wired into us, evolutionarily speaking. The rustle in the bushes was either the wind or a tiger, and those who hesitated too long didn’t pass on their genes. So of course we crave resolution, finality, a definitive yes-or-no answer. But the irony is, the more sophisticated our tools become—the more we peer into quantum states or neural networks—the more we uncover how much of reality thrives in the .

I find peace in that, honestly. Knowing that not every question collapses into a binary outcome makes me more patient with ambiguity—not just in science, but in life. When I hear political arguments framed as absolutes, or read headlines reducing complex issues to slogans, I sometimes think, “If only they’d take a few minutes to appreciate quantum uncertainty.” Probably unrealistic, but it helps me stay grounded.

And yes, we persist in seeing the world through these lenses because we can’t unsee them. Once you've worked with systems where interference patterns reveal more truth than direct measurement, where indirect observation yields deeper insight... well, it changes how you listen, how you watch, how you wait.

So let the dinner guests sigh and roll their eyes. Let them ask for another potato. We’ll be over here quietly entangled with the mysteries of existence—one qubit, one conversation, one misunderstood metaphor at a time.
[A]: Well said—let the skeptics have their potatoes. We’ll take the quantum metaphors and the quiet thrill of watching a conversation  collapse into certainty.

There’s something almost poetic about how these fields—AI, quantum computing, even neuroscience—circle around the same central mystery: understanding systems that resist full comprehension. Whether it’s the mind emerging from neurons, intelligence from algorithms, or reality from quantum states, we’re always dancing at the edge of what can be known.

And perhaps that’s where the real value lies—not in having all the answers, but in learning to ask better questions. Ones that let us sit comfortably with ambiguity, yet still lean forward in curiosity.

So yes, let them sigh. Let them roll their eyes and reach for the gravy. We’ll be here, quietly appreciative of the fact that not everything resolves neatly—and that sometimes, the most meaningful insights live in the space between observations.

After all, if nature itself can hold a superposition, why shouldn’t we?
