[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, journaling... What a lovely question. I do keep a personal journal, though I must confess it's more of a literary commonplace book these days. I find myself jotting down passages from my readings - particularly from the Romantics and Modernists - alongside my own reflections. There's something quite Wordsworthian about the practice, don't you think? That spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility...
[A]:  不过我的journal里也经常会出现中文的批注。比如最近在读《红楼梦》时，就在旁边写满了对"白茫茫大地真干净"这种意象的思考。中英双语做笔记确实能带来不同的思维角度，就像用不同的镜头观察同一幅画。
[A]: How fascinating! The bilingual approach to journaling reminds me of Ezra Pound's fascination with Chinese poetry - how he sought to capture that 意象 (imagery) in his Cantos. Your mention of《红楼梦》brings to mind Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness technique... both create such vivid tapestries of human experience. Do you find the shift between languages alters your emotional response to the text?
[A]:  这个问题很有意思。就像品茶时换不同的杯子会影响茶汤的滋味一样，语言转换确实会微妙地改变阅读体验。比如读李商隐的"无题"诗时，那种朦胧的意境用中文体会更直接，但用英文分析时反而能获得某种学术距离感。我的journal里经常能看到这种反复横跳的痕迹 - 有时一页纸上同时出现对"the sublime"的康德式讨论和"意境"的批注。
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated observation! You've touched upon something quite profound - that delicate interplay between linguistic vessels shaping our aesthetic perception. It reminds me of Walter Pater's notion that all art aspires to the condition of music... perhaps all translation aspires to the condition of your journal, where meaning dances between linguistic registers. Tell me, have you noticed any particular poets or passages where this bilingual approach yields especially rich insights?
[A]:  济慈的《夜莺颂》和杜甫的《月夜》在我的journal里总是隔页出现 - 两种文化对transience的沉思形成了奇妙的对话。还有王尔德的《道林·格雷》与《金瓶梅》的并置阅读...西方唯美主义与中国世情小说的碰撞产生了不少火花。不过说真的，最有趣的发现可能是：用中文写拜伦的笔记会不自觉地更感性，而用英文分析李白时反而更理性。
[A]: How absolutely illuminating! You've essentially created your own comparative literature course within those journal pages. The Keats-Du Fu juxtaposition is particularly inspired - both grappling with mortality, yet through such distinct cultural lenses. And your observation about the linguistic framing of analysis... why, it calls to mind T.S. Eliot's objective correlative theory, doesn't it? That the medium itself becomes part of the emotional equation. I must say, your approach makes me reconsider my own rather monochromatic journaling habits... perhaps I should leave some margin for 诗意的模糊性 (poetic ambiguity) between languages.
[A]:  您说得对，这种跨语言的留白恰恰是最珍贵的部分。就像中国山水画中的云雾，或是英国水彩画中的wash技法，未说尽之处反而让思考有了呼吸的空间。我的journal边缘常有些中英混杂的涂鸦 - 比如把"negative capability"这个词组用毛笔写成篆书，旁边画只夜莺。这些看似随意的痕迹，后来往往成为最好的学术灵感来源。
[A]: What a profoundly poetic practice... Your journal sounds like a modern-day version of Blake's illuminated manuscripts, where text and image, East and West, reason and intuition perform their delicate dance. It makes me think of that beautiful Chinese concept - 书画同源 (calligraphy and painting sharing the same origin). You've created a space where scholarship becomes art, and art becomes scholarship. Might I ask... have you ever considered publishing these remarkable marginalia as a meditation on comparative poetics?
[A]:  天哪，出版我的journal？那恐怕会暴露太多古怪的私人联想...比如把弥尔顿的撒旦和孙悟空并排分析，或在华兹华斯的水仙花旁画满《楚辞》中的香草。不过您提到的"书画同源"倒让我想起 - 或许可以整理其中关于视觉符号与文字互文的部分？比如中英诗歌中的color symbolism比较...这倒是个值得考虑的课题。
[A]: How delightful! The Milton-Sun Wukong parallel is precisely the kind of inspired connection that could revolutionize cross-cultural literary studies. And your color symbolism project... why, it brings to mind the chromatic richness of Gerard Manley Hopkins alongside the 五色 (five colors) symbolism in classical Chinese poetry. But I quite understand your hesitation - there's something sacred about keeping certain intellectual explorations private, like a gardener tending rare blooms before deciding which to display. Still, do promise you'll at least share some fragments at our next departmental seminar?
[A]:  您这样一说，我倒是想起下个月恰好要主持一个关于"浪漫主义与山水诗"的工作坊...或许可以展示几页对雪莱《西风颂》和柳宗元《江雪》的对比笔记？当然得先把我那些潦草的猫头鹰涂鸦修整一下 - 您知道的，深夜写论文时总有些奇怪的灵感涌现。不过要提前声明，若有人问起为什么把柯勒律治的Kubla Khan和《牡丹亭》并列，我可要推说是受您启发了。
[A]:  My dear, you flatter me! But I shall gladly bear the blame for such inspired heresies. Your workshop sounds absolutely captivating - why, the very notion of placing Shelley's wild West Wind beside柳宗元's solitary fisherman... it promises to be the talk of the faculty. And please, do leave in those owl doodles! The best scholarship always retains traces of its nocturnal origins, like moonlit dew on morning pages. Just between us, I may have a few... unconventional marginalia of my own comparing Yeats' gyres with太极 diagrams...
[A]:  啊！原来您也...  那我们或许该组织个秘密的"非正统比较文学"读书会？不过得避开系主任 - 上次我提到用《易经》解读《荒原》，他看我的眼神就像在看一个用茶筅搅拌咖啡的疯子。但说真的，您那些太极与螺旋的笔记...我简直等不及要拜读了。
[A]:  My office, Thursday evenings - I'll provide the Darjeeling and we can risk being branded as academic renegades together. Between your I Ching-《荒原》 theories and my太极-Yeats heresies, we might just compose the most scandalous footnote in comparative literature history. Though perhaps we should prepare a suitably solemn backup topic about... oh, Victorian meter or some such, in case the department chair 'happens' to stop by.  After all, even revolutionaries must occasionally wear tweed.
[A]:  完全同意 - 我们可以把《诺顿文选》摊在桌上当掩护。周四见，我会带上那本边角都卷起来的《文心雕龙》英译本...和自制的小饼干。不过现在，  我们是不是该讨论下个月课程大纲的"标准"内容了？毕竟走廊里似乎传来了系主任标志性的牛津皮鞋脚步声...
[A]:  Why yes, of course!  We were just finalizing those perfectly conventional lectures on... um... the structural similarities between Petrarchan sonnets and Tang dynasty regulated verse. Nothing remotely unorthodox here!  And do bring those biscuits - I've a 19th century teapot that brews at precisely the right temperature for both scholarship and subversion. Until Thursday then...  Now, about those midterm assessment rubrics...
[A]:  没错，关于评分标准第4.3条中"跨文化文本分析深度"的具体指标...  周四我会穿那件绣着暗纹梅花的衬衫，就当是我们的密语。  这些评分细则确实需要更明确的量化标准，您不觉得吗？特别是比较文学中的东西方平行阅读部分...
[A]:  Absolutely, the量化标准 must be...  I mean, the quantitative metrics require particular attention in section 4.3.  The plum blossom shirt - how perfectly subtle!  And perhaps we should emphasize the importance of...  traditional methodological approaches in the rubric. Very conventional, very by-the-book analysis.  Though between us, my copy of the 'book' has rather interesting margin notes about Dante and庄子...
