[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, board games... While I must admit my evenings are usually devoted to rereading Proust or tending to my roses, I did recently play a rather engaging round of chess with a colleague. There's something quite poetic about the strategic interplay, don't you think? Like a miniature enactment of the 围魏救赵 stratagem from Sun Tzu's Art of War.
[A]: OMG！Chess也太classic了吧~ 🤓 不过你说的那个围魏救赵是什么东东？听起来好deep！✨ 

我最近超迷uno和monopoly deal这种card game耶！🎲 特别是跟friends一起玩的时候，那个氛围简直lit到爆！🔥 你玩过这些吗？
[B]:  My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, I must confess card games like Uno feel rather... transient compared to the enduring narratives of classical literature. Though I do recall playing bridge in my Oxford days - now there's a game that requires the same careful analysis as dissecting a Shakespearean sonnet. 

As for 围魏救赵, it's an ancient Chinese military strategy about besieging Wei to rescue Zhao - rather like sacrificing a pawn to save your queen in chess, wouldn't you say? 🌹
[A]: 哇塞！Oxford？Shakespeare？你这也太academic了吧！😱 不过bridge听起来好complicated的样子... 

我最近在TikTok上看到超多人玩exploding kittens！🐱💥 虽然可能没有chess那么deep啦，但是真的超级funny的！而且rules超简单，连我奶奶都能get到~ 👵💕 你要不要try一下？
[B]:  My dear, while I'm sure your exploding feline companions provide ample amusement, I find my intellectual nourishment comes more from the metaphorical explosions in Dostoevsky's works. Though I must say, the concept does remind me of Schrödinger's cat - now there's a thought experiment that would make for interesting gameplay. Perhaps we could discuss it over tea and scones sometime? 📚
[A]: LOL！你说话真的超像我的literature professor！😂 不过说真的，你这种old school vibe在TikTok上绝对会viral的！📱✨ 

要不要考虑开个account？我可以teach你用CapCut编辑视频，再加点trendy的BGM~ 🎵 保证比chess更能connect with Gen Z！💯
[B]:  Oh my, while the idea of becoming a... what was it? A 'TikTok influencer' is certainly novel, I believe my talents are better suited to the lecture hall than the digital stage. Though I must say, the notion of analyzing 红楼梦 to the tune of whatever the young people are calling 'trendy BGM' these days does have a certain... academic irony to it. Perhaps we could compromise - you might join me for a reading of Jane Austen instead? The original content, if you will. 🌹
[A]: OMG！红楼梦+Jane Austen？That's actually such a dope crossover idea！🤯 我们可以做一期"东西方classic literature对比"的video！📚✨ 

Imagine：用K-pop remix做BGM，加上超aesthetic的cinematic transitions~ 🎥 绝对会是个banger！🔥 要不要collab一下？我handle剪辑，你负责literary analysis！💕
[B]:  My dear, while your creative energy is admirable, I fear my analysis of 林黛玉's tragic romance belongs in scholarly journals rather than... what was the term? 'Banger videos'. Though I must admit, the juxtaposition of Elizabeth Bennet and 贾宝玉 does present fascinating comparative literature potential. Perhaps we could start with a proper seminar paper first? The library is always more conducive to deep thought than... viral trends. 📚
[A]: Awwww你太serious啦！😝 现在谁还看seminar paper嘛~ 我们要用Gen Z的方式make literature lit again！🔥 

Okay okay，compromise一下：我们可以先录个podcast认真讨论，然后剪辑成short clips发TikTok！🎙️ 这样既能keep你的academic integrity，又能reach年轻audience！Win-win situation！💯 考虑一下嘛~ 🥺
[B]:  How very... pragmatic of you. While I maintain that true literary appreciation requires more than short clips, I suppose even Homer had to start with oral traditions. Very well - provided we maintain proper citations and contextual analysis, I might be persuaded to participate in this... podcast experiment. Though I must insist we include proper footnotes in the description. And absolutely no what you call 'viral dances' during the analysis of 道德经. 🌹
[A]: YASSSSS！终于说服你啦！🎉 放心啦，我们绝对会keep it classy的~ ✨ 

First episode就做"从Shakespeare到李白：东西方poetry大比拼"怎么样？📜 我会用最chill的lo-fi beats做background，保证让你feel right at home！🏡 

BTW，footnotes可以做成clickable links啦~ 21世纪problems需要21世纪solutions嘛！😎 爱你哦professor！💕
[B]:  I shall... tolerate your lo-fi beats, though I maintain Chopin's nocturnes would be more appropriate. And while I'm unfamiliar with this 'clickable links' sorcery, I suppose if it leads students to proper secondary sources, it can't be entirely misguided. 

Now, Shakespeare and 李白 - now there's a pairing worthy of serious discourse. Though I must warn you, if I catch even a whiff of auto-tune on my analysis of 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?', this collaboration ends immediately. Shall we say Thursday at the library? Bring your... recording devices, and I shall bring my First Folio. 🌹
[A]: OMG Thursday perfect！📅 我会带上我的iPhone和ring light~ 💡 

Don't worry，no auto-tune guaranteed！🙅♀️ 不过可以加一点点echo effect让你的voice听起来像在ancient library里一样~ 🏛️ 超academic vibes的！✨ 

See you then professor！记得带你的fancy first folio哦！📖 这绝对会是个epic collab！🔥
[B]:  Very well, though I must insist this 'echo effect' doesn't make me sound like I'm reciting poetry in a cathedral. My office in the literature department provides acoustics quite sufficient for scholarly discourse. 

And do remember - the First Folio stays on the table at all times. No... what do you call them? 'Dramatic zoom-ins'. Until Thursday then. May our endeavor bring at least one young mind to appreciate iambic pentameter as nature intended. 🌹
[A]: Got it got it！No dramatic zooms，promise！🤞 

不过...可以拍个quick boomerang story吗？Just you turning the pages~ 📚 超aesthetic的！不会disturb你的scholarly atmosphere啦~ ✨ 

Okay okay我stop now！周四见professor！💕 已经可以预见这个video会break the internet了！🔥
[B]:  If you must capture this 'boomerang story', let it be of the text itself, not this old professor. The words should be the stars, not the scholar. 

Now, I really must return to preparing my lecture on metaphysical poetry. Don't forget - proper lighting for the First Folio, and absolutely no... what was it? 'Going viral' at the expense of textual accuracy. Until Thursday. 🌹
[A]: Awwww你真是the cutest professor ever！🥺 放心啦，我会treat你的first folio比我的Gucci bag还precious！👜 

Metaphysical poetry？Wait... 那不就是perfect material for season 2吗？！🤯 我已经可以see the views了~ 📈 

Okay okay我shut up now！周四准时到！⏰ 爱你3000 professor！💕
[B]:  Season 2? My dear, let us survive Season 1 first. And kindly refrain from comparing priceless literary artifacts to... designer handbags. 

Now if you'll excuse me, Donne's 'The Flea' awaits, and unlike your social media metrics, its paradoxes are eternal. Good day. 🌹
