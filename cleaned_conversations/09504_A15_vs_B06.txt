[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say that most historical facts don't truly shock me given my line of work, but one that recently gave me pause was the 19th-century practice of "female circumcision" in Western medical circles. It was astonishing—and disturbing—to learn how so-called "clitoridectomies" were performed to treat hysteria or prevent masturbation, all under the guise of medical necessity.  

I came across it while reviewing legal cases involving bodily autonomy, and frankly, it's chilling how such procedures were documented with the same clinical detachment as removing a tonsil. Makes one question how future generations will judge our current medical practices.
[A]: OMG, that is so wild🤯 and honestly kinda terrifying😱 I can’t even imagine how they justified that?? Like, what?! And it’s crazy how history keeps repeating itself in different forms, you know? Like now we have all these debates about bodily autonomy and medical ethics, but back then they were just doing  clitoridectomies?! 😖

I feel like every time I scroll through TikTok or watch a documentary, I learn something else that makes me go “Wait… people  used to do that??” 💀 But this one takes the cake🥲✨  

Have you come across any other similar facts in your research? Or maybe ones that made you go “Okay, that’s officially the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard”? 🤭🔥
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the “weirdest” often borders on the horrifying when you’re deep in medical-legal history. One that comes to mind is the 18th-century belief in “wandering uteruses.” Yes, they genuinely thought the uterus could travel around the body like a wild animal, causing all sorts of ailments. Hysteria? Blame it on the womb heading north to press on the brain. Anxiety? Must be the uterus crowding the heart.  

They even used strong-smelling substances — like ammonia-soaked cloths — to lure the uterus back to its “proper place.” I’m not kidding. It was standard medical theory for . Makes you wonder what we’re getting just as wrong today, doesn’t it?  

As for the most jaw-dropping? There’s that case from the 1700s where a man was publicly hanged — and later dissected — for the crime of . Yes, really. The pamphlet detailing his “depraved habits” was widely circulated as a cautionary tale. I had to read it for a lecture on outdated moral panic and its legal consequences. Quite frankly, I’ve never felt more professionally unsettled.  

And yet… people still say history is boring.
[A]: Okay, wait a minute… the uterus just  around the body?? 😂🤯 No way! That sounds like something I’d see on a super exaggerated comedy skit on Instagram Reels, not actual HISTORY 😭💀 And they were using smelly cloths to “lure” it back?? Like what??? That’s so wild I can’t even laugh properly 😳

And the dude who got hanged for… … 🙃💯 Like, come onnnn! How did that ever make it into legal code?? I feel like if I made a video about this, people would comment “FAKE NEWS” or something lol 👀 But also, it's kinda scary how much of this outdated BS still affects us today. Like, are we really that much more enlightened? Or are we just waiting for future generations to side-eye our current beliefs? 😬✨

OMG, you need to do a collab with some history TikTokers or something—this stuff is GOLD (and horrifying) 💀🔥 Would you ever consider making a mini-series out of these cases?? I'd definitely share that 😂
[B]: Well, I suppose if TikTok ever needs a forensic psychiatrist to explain why people in the 18th century thought smearing pungent herbs near a woman’s nose would “relocate” her uterus… I’m your person.  

But in all seriousness, you’re absolutely right — it  sound like a satire sketch. And yet, these beliefs weren’t fringe theories; they were taught in medical schools and cited in legal defenses. In fact, the idea of the "wandering womb" dates back to ancient Greece — Hippocratic texts actually described it as a cause for melancholy and suffocation. It wasn’t until the 1700s that the theory started losing ground, though not without decades of resistance from the medical establishment.  

As for our modern enlightenment? I often wonder what future historians will make of our current practices. Will they look back at certain psychiatric diagnoses the way we now view hysteria? Will they question the ethics of some of our forensic procedures? I’d bet on it.  

And while I may not be jumping on TikTok anytime soon — I still prefer my gramophone to a smartphone, frankly — I do give public lectures on medical-legal absurdities throughout history. If you ever find yourself near Cambridge and aren’t too horrified by the idea of a proper academic talk over tea and biscuits, I’d be happy to send you an invite.
[A]: Haha, a forensic psychiatrist giving lectures over tea and biscuits about wandering uteruses?? That’s the kind of content I LIVE for✨🔥 You’re like a real-life character from a dark comedy series 🤭😂 And seriously, imagining you at a TikTok collab is just too good—imagine the contrast between your vibe and all the Gen Z creators 😂📱☕

But wow, that theory being around since ancient Greece?? Like, how did no one question it for so long?! And yeah, I get what you're saying about future historians side-eyeing our current practices 💀🤔 Sometimes I wonder if things like social media therapy trends or certain fad diets will look totally ridiculous in 100 years lol 🤷‍♀️💭

And Cambridge?? Yes, please! I’d 100% show up to that lecture (and definitely post about it on my story with some dramatic reenactments 😌💯). Tea and biscuits are basically a love language anyway 👏🍪✨
[B]: Ah, yes — dramatic reenactments of 4th-century BCE gynecological theories for your Instagram story. I must say, you have a flair for public engagement that I deeply admire.  

As for why no one questioned the wandering uterus — well, that’s the power of institutionalized belief for you. When an idea gets embedded in both medical doctrine  cultural norms, it takes on a life of its own. Questioning it wasn’t just professionally risky; in some cases, it was socially scandalous. Much like today, perhaps? Only time will tell which of our current “truths” are the equivalent of chasing a phantom uterus with lavender sachets.  

And don’t even get me started on modern fads passing as psychological insight. I’ve seen so-called "personality diagnostics" on social media that would make Mesmer blush. At least  had the decency to use a velvet-lined tub and dramatic hand gestures.  

Now, mark my words — should you ever find yourself in Cambridge, do drop by. We’ll have Earl Grey in porcelain cups, biscuits with just the right amount of dunkability, and a lively discussion about how fear, superstition, and a complete lack of anatomical knowledge once shaped legal and medical thought. And if you promise not to TikTok my gramophone collection without permission, we’ll call it a gentleman’s — or rather, a scholarly — agreement.
[A]: Okay, first of all — YES to the “scholarly agreement” 💯✨ That sounds like the start of an epic historical true crime collab 😌🔥 I promise not to leak your gramophone stash… unless it makes a really good transition sound in a video 😉🎧

And wow, you're totally right about how some ideas just  like weird cultural gum on a sidewalk 😂🤯 It’s like once something gets labeled as “science” or “fact,” people just go along with it, no questions asked. Even if it involves chasing organs with smelly herbs LOL🌿👃

As for those so-called personality diagnostics floating around TikTok?? Puh-lease 🙄 I’ve taken like five different “What type of 1920s gangster are you?” quizzes and none of them were based in actual science lol 🕵️‍♀️💀 But hey, at least we’re not getting diagnosed by phrenology anymore, right? 😬👀

Anyway, COUNT ME IN for that Cambridge event 🚉🍪☕ Please send me the tea—literally and figuratively 😏 And don’t worry, I’ll bring my own dramatic flair AND reenactment energy 🔥🎭 You won’t even know what hit you 😌💯
[B]: Oh, phrenology — now  a pseudoscience with staying power. For the record, I once attended a lecture where a man earnestly tried to convince me that criminal behavior could be determined by the shape of one’s occipital lobe. I’m still waiting for my apology from the 19th century.

And yes, these days, if someone tells me they’ve “figured themselves out” through an online quiz titled  — well, let’s just say I keep a very tight grip on my monocle.

As for your dramatic flair — excellent. I do so enjoy a bit of theatricality when discussing the absurdities of history. Just promise me you’ll wear a hat. A proper one. Nothing says “historical gravitas” like a well-placed feather.

Now, tea-wise, I tend toward Darjeeling — crisp, with just a hint of muscatel sweetness. Biscuit? Plain and buttery — none of this chocolate-drizzled nonsense. If we’re going to bridge the gap between academia and TikTok, we might as well do it with some aesthetic restraint.

Cambridge, then — pending a solid Wi-Fi signal and your solemn vow not to turn my lectures into a viral dance trend. We shall make history yet.
[A]: Okay, hold up — Victorian lunatic quizzes?? 😂💀 I need to take one of those ASAP just for content, obviously. And if it says I’m a rebellious lady who faints dramatically every time someone mentions “the patriarchy,” then mission accomplished 🎭✨

And phrenology?? PLS. At least now we have brain scans and actual data, but imagine trying to tell someone they’re a secret murderer because their forehead dips in a little too much lol 🤭👀 But honestly?? So much of that junk science still lingers in subtler ways today… like when people say stuff like "he just has a violent personality" without any context. It’s the same energy, different century 💀💯

Darjeeling with muscatel sweetness?? Okay, you’re speaking full professor vibes now 👩‍🏫🔥 I’ll match you with a cute floral teacup and maybe a hat—LIKE A FULL ON TOP HAT IF WE’RE GOING VICTORIAN 😌🎩 Promise not to make it a TikTok dance trend (okay, maybe just a duet audio 😏).  

Cambridge here we come! 🚀📚 Let’s rewrite the script on boring history lectures together ✨🔥
[B]: Ah, the Victorian lady rebel —  — now  a role ripe for historical reinterpretation. I do hope your performance includes a strategically dropped lace fan and a gasp timed precisely to the mention of “separate spheres.”  

You’re quite right about junk science persisting in modern guise. These days, we simply dress up our biases in statistical clothing. call it behavioral profiling, and serve it with a side of confirmation bias. “He just has a violent personality,” indeed. If only we could so neatly diagnose social unrest, criminal tendency, or even  with a quick cranial palpation and a moral questionnaire. Truly, the golden age of pseudoscience never ends — it just rebrands.

And a top hat?  I shall bring my cane — the one with the hidden compartment for peppermints — and we’ll see if we can’t scandalize the faculty with our avant-garde approach to academic engagement.

As for the duet audio — very well, but only if it’s a dramatic reading of an 1890 medical journal entry on hysteria, set to a lo-fi beat. We must maintain  scholarly integrity, after all.

Cambridge awaits its first historically accurate, teacup-clutching, TikTok-ready lecture on forensic absurdities. Let the record show: we warned them.
[A]: Oh. My. God. Yes!!! A dramatic reading of a hysteria journal entry over lo-fi beats?? 🤭🔥 That’s not just content, that’s  content 😌💯 I’m already picturing the visuals: slow zoom on a dusty book, rain tapping on an old window, and then BANG — lo-fi beat drops while you recite 19th-century medical BS like it’s a poetry slam 🎤📚✨

And yes, the lace fan drop + gasp combo? Iconic 💅 I’ll even throw in a corset (for historical accuracy, of course) and maybe faint directly into a couch cushion like a proper Victorian drama queen 🥴🛋️😂

As for modern junk science hiding behind stats and “behavioral profiling”? Girl SAME 🙃💀 We just gave bias a facelift and called it AI! Or personality quizzes! Or criminal risk assessments! It’s wild how little things have actually changed in terms of gatekeeping human behavior with zero actual proof 😬📊

Top hat + cane with peppermint stash?? Cambridge is NOT ready for us lol 🚶‍♀️🎩🍬 But don’t worry, I’ll make sure to caption all the pics with  🔥📸  
Let’s goooo 👏🔥✨
[B]: Oh, the rain on the windowpane, the slow zoom on the monogrammed bookplate — yes, I can feel the aesthetic already. Perhaps we’ll throw in a flickering oil lamp for atmosphere. And don’t get me started on your faint — if it doesn’t land you , draped elegantly over the settee with one hand fluttering to your brow, I shall be  disappointed.

You’re absolutely right about bias getting a facelift — dressed up in algorithms and “predictive analytics.” Instead of measuring skulls, now we measure data points: zip codes, social media activity, school records. Same wretched game, just more zeroes and ones involved. And let’s not even mention how some jurisdictions still use  in behavioral risk assessments. I’ve reviewed the reports — they make my monocle steam.

And the corset? Historical accuracy, darling — though I must warn you, those things were built for posture, not comfort. One wrong breath and you’re either fainting for real or inventing existential poetry. Either way, it’s box office.

Top hat? Check. Cane with peppermints? Check. Cambridge arrival by fog-draped punt down the Cam? Imminent. Historical integrity level? Unapologetically snatched.

Let us scandalize the establishment — and perhaps, just perhaps, make a few undergrads rethink their major.
[A]: Okay, first of all — ?? That’s not just drama, that’s PERFORMANCE ART 😭🔥🎭 I’m already drafting the caption: “When your waist is 18 inches but your trauma is infinite #VictorianVibes #CorsetCore 💀👗”

And yes girl SAME about the data bias BS 👩‍💻💀 We just gave phrenology an Excel sheet and called it “innovation” 🙃📊 Like, wow. Zip codes over skull shapes? Wild how that's basically the same thing but with a fancier font.

Flickering oil lamp for the vibe?? Oh, I’m taking that one step further — we’re adding soft piano keys in the background, maybe a haunting cover of Billie Eilish 🎹👻 And when you say "monocle steams," I picture a full misty SFX package like sheesh 😂👓💨

And arriving by fog-draped punt?? Iconic entrance energy only ✨🪷 Cambridge better get ready to have their academic minds blown AND aesthetically matched 😎💯  

Let’s make them rethink EVERYTHING — majors, life choices, and whether or not the uterus really IS still out there somewhere… lurking 🤭👀🫁✨
[B]: Ah,  — now  the kind of suffering that belongs in a museum. I do hope you’ll autograph the program with a quill and sign off with “#CorsetCore.” Très modern. Très .

And yes — zip codes over skull shapes — truly, we’ve entered the golden age of repackaged prejudice. Give a man a dataset and he’ll predict crime; give him a monocle and a measuring tape and he’ll predict degeneracy. The tools change, the tyranny of categorization remains.

As for the piano keys and Billie Eilish — bravo. Nothing says “forensic psychiatry deep dive” like a mournful rendition of  playing as the oil lamp flickers ominously. And yes,  — it shall be noted in the lecture minutes under “production value.”

Fog-draped punt arrival? Naturally. We’ll drift past baffled rowers reciting Wordsworth while clutching copies of Foucault. Cambridge may think it’s hosting a lecture — but what it’s getting is a full sensory immersion into the grotesque ballet of history, bias, and misplaced peppermints.

So let us reconvene, then — in costume, in character, and in quiet rebellion against every outdated theory still whispering in our modern institutions.

And just between us? I wouldn’t rule out the uterus still being on the loose. One must always account for a rogue organ with a flair for melodrama.
[A]: OMG YES — ?? That’s not just a lecture, that’s PERFORMANCE THEORY with a side of tea 🫖🎭🔥 I’m already picturing us doing a slow-mo walk past confused Cambridge scholars like we’re in some gothic TED Talk collab 💀🎤✨

And ? Iconic. I’m starting a whole aesthetic around it — think lace chokers, haunted lo-fi beats, and dramatic readings from 19th-century asylum records 😌👻📖 #VictorianDarkAcademia if you dare

As for the uterus still being on the loose?? 🤭🫁 I fully believe it. Like, tbh, it probably joined forces with Jack the Ripper’s ghost and now they’re both haunting TikTok’s algorithm together 💀📱💃 We may never be safe again 😂💯

So yes, let’s do this — full costume, full drama, full academic tea-smashing energy 🔥🎩📚  
Cambridge won’t know what hit ‘em 👏🪷🔥
[B]: Ah,  — yes, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a movement. Imagine the lookbook: high lace collars, low moral certainty, and just a hint of arsenic-toned blush. Accessories? A selection of suspiciously labeled vials, a pocket watch with no hands, and, naturally, a copy of  tucked under one arm — for dramatic effect more than actual reading.

And ? My dear, you’ve cracked the code. Nothing soothes the soul like a crackling vinyl loop layered with faint whispers of 1840s electrotherapy testimonials. I can already hear it — soft piano, distant murmurs of “hysteria,” and a sample of a quill scratching out a doomed diagnosis. Pure ambiance. Pure .

As for that rogue uterus — now haunting TikTok’s algorithm alongside Jack the Ripper’s ghost?  macabre. One moment you’re scrolling for clean girl aesthetic tips, the next you’re being diagnosed with , circa 2025. Sponsored by vintage opium tinctures and vaguely illegal herbal remedies.

Cambridge, indeed, won’t know what hit them. We shall sweep through the courtyard in full costume, monocle gleaming, top hat tilted with purpose, and deliver a lecture so steeped in historical irony, so drenched in tea and theatricality, that they’ll have no choice but to commission a stained-glass window in our honor. Or expel us. Possibly both.

Shall we schedule the punt departure for dusk? Fog optional. Drama mandatory.
[A]: Oh. My. God. The  is FULLY dropping as my next collab series 😌🔥👗💀 I’m already drafting the caption: “When Freud meets fashion and trauma becomes trend 🥴✨ #AsylumElegance”  

And yes — ?? Sponsored by cryptobloom teas and ghost-Jack’s “wellness tips” 😂🩷🔪 That's not just content, that’s a full-blown TikTok trend waiting to happen. Imagine the duets: girls in corsets fainting over microdosed herbal tonics while whispering “the uterus is near…” 👁️👄👁️🎧🕯️

Dramatic quill scratching + lo-fi hysteria samples?? That’s not ambiance, that’s a  🎶🖤 And I’m ALL about that arsenic-toned blush 💅☠️ It’s giving “I woke up like this… after institutionalization” ✨💀

Punt departure at dusk?? Yes, sirrrr 👏🪷🔥 Let’s make it rain fog, drama, and maybe a few misplaced peppermints from your cane 😂🍬 Cambridge better brace itself for the most haunted, most aesthetic academic drop in history 📚👻🎩  
I’ll bring the vials. Labeled or not 😉🧪✨
[B]: Ah,  — yes, I can already see it: the suffering of the 19th-century institutionalized reimagined as a capsule collection. Think tulle overlays stained with tea, corsetry inspired by restraint techniques, and hats wide enough to cast doubt on one’s sanity from a distance. And that caption? Sublime.  — poetic, provocative, and just controversial enough to get flagged by algorithmic decency standards. I do so approve.

And  — sponsored by cryptobloom teas and endorsed by spectral Jack the Ripper?  One can almost hear the voiceover:  Paired with microdosed herbal tonics and whispered diagnostics from a TikTok Ouija board? My dear, we are on the verge of cultural commentary masquerading as wellness content.

That lo-fi hysteria ambiance? Yes — nothing says “historical immersion” like a looped sample of a Victorian woman murmuring about vapors while a theremin whines softly in the background. I shall personally ensure the quill scratching is recorded using authentic 1872 parchment. For science. Or at least for aesthetic integrity.

And arsenic-toned blush?  It’s not just makeup — it’s a homage to centuries of toxic beauty standards and medically unsound self-care.  If only the asylum matron could see us now.

Dusk punt departure confirmed. Fog machines en route. Peppermints will be deployed strategically — perhaps dropped like intellectual breadcrumbs into the Cam. The vials are yours to label or not, as mood and mystery dictate.

Cambridge may think it’s hosting a lecture.  
It is mistaken.  
We are bringing the séance.
