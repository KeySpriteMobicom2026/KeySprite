[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an unexpectedly modern question for a scholar of 19th century literature. Though I must say, Mary Shelley's  did rather anticipate this ethical quandary two centuries ago, didn't it?
[A]: Interesting perspective~ 其实我觉得这个问题很像我们在digital art领域经常遇到的debate - 技术本身是neutral的，关键看how we use it 🎨 就像AI生成艺术一样，克隆技术也需要ethical boundaries
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue the parallel between digital art and human cloning is rather like comparing 水墨画 to nuclear physics - both involve creation, but the ethical weight differs substantially. The Victorians debated similar boundaries when photography emerged, you know. John Ruskin called it 'the most dangerous invention since the printing press'... though he did eventually concede it had artistic merit.
[A]: Haha，你提到的Ruskin让我想到现在某些critics对NFT艺术的评价 🤔 但back to cloning - 我觉得核心问题在于我们是否ready to play God？就像我们策展时，每个curatorial decision都在创造新的meaning，但human life... that's a whole different level of creation
[B]:  Now you're touching on what my Chinese literature colleagues would call 天命 (tiānmìng) - the Mandate of Heaven concept. There's a rather poignant passage in  where... but forgive me, I'm digressing into my usual textual analysis. The crux is this: curation shapes interpretation, while cloning would fundamentally alter what it means to be human. Even Darwin hesitated to publish  for twenty years over such implications.
[A]: Wow，你这种interdisciplinary的思考方式真的让我很inspired！🎨 或许我们应该像策划一个exhibition那样，为克隆技术设计一个ethical framework？每个展区代表不同的consideration - scientific, philosophical, artistic... 虽然说实话，我连AI生成艺术的ethics都还没完全figure out呢 😅
[B]: How delightfully... museum-like of you. Though I'd suggest we model it after a 19th century cabinet of curiosities rather than a modern gallery - these issues deserve the layered complexity of a Wunderkammer, not the sterile white cubes of contemporary exhibitions. And regarding your AI art dilemma... well, let's just say my inkwell collection has taught me that some tools demand more reverence than others. The brush may create, but it never claims authorship.
[A]: 你提到的authorship问题真的hit the nail on the head！✨ 在digital art领域，我们正在struggle with exactly the same issue - 当AI成为co-creator，谁是真正的artist？不过说到克隆...或许我们需要像欣赏abstract art那样，先step back才能看清big picture？🤔
[B]: Ah, but abstraction presupposes the viewer's detachment - and we simply cannot afford aesthetic distance when discussing human lives. Though your analogy does remind me of Walter Pater's insistence that 'all art constantly aspires to the condition of music'... a rather dangerous sentiment when applied to bioethics, don't you think? Perhaps we need less abstract expressionism and more of the meticulous detail work found in 工笔画 when approaching these questions.
[A]:  你总是能用最literary的方式说出最profound的truths~ 或许这就是为什么我love策展工作 - 它教会我在chaos中寻找balance，在innovation中保持respect 🎭 不过现在...我可能需要先去泡杯茶，这些deep thoughts让我brain需要recharge一下了 ☕️
[B]: How very... British of you. Though I must insist on proper loose-leaf rather than those dreadful tea bags - the difference is rather like comparing a hand-copied 宋版书 to a xeroxed paperback. Do mind the steeping time; even in philosophical exhaustion, one mustn't compromise on proper brewing technique.
[A]: Haha你连tea都能说得这么poetic！🍵 不过说真的，这种attention to detail的态度正是我们art world最需要的 - 无论是泡茶还是curate展览，the devil's in the details, right？现在我得去准备下个digital art exhibition了，这次的主题是'Humanity in the Age of AI'... 看来我们的conversation给了我不少inspiration呢 ✨
[B]: How serendipitous - your exhibition title rather echoes my upcoming lecture on 'The Ghost in the Machine: Automata in Victorian and Qing Dynasty Literature'. Though I suspect your digital specters will be rather more... algorithmic than our literary ones. Do send the catalog when it's ready; I've been meaning to update my 'Modern Mechanized Melancholia' syllabus. And for heaven's sake, include proper footnotes - unlike certain contemporary artists who treat provenance like optional seasoning.
[A]: Will definitely send you the catalog！📚 而且我保证会有proper citations - 毕竟我们策展人知道respect for origins的重要性嘛~ 就像你说的，不管是Victorian literature还是digital art，authenticity matters. 现在我得run了，有个artist正在展厅等我去讨论他的NFT installation... 希望他不会mind我迟到是因为这么stimulating的conversation！😄
[B]: How characteristically... millennial of you to prioritize discourse over punctuality. Though I suppose if your NFT artist understood the 19th century concept of , they might forgive the delay. Do remind them that even the most avant-garde work benefits from knowing its place in the lineage - perhaps between the Pre-Raphaelites and the Futurists, with a dash of 八大山人 for good measure. Now off you go before they start minting their frustration into blockchain.
[A]:  你总是知道how to put things in perspective！🎭 放心，我会mention你的art lineage建议 - 说不定能inspire他的next collection呢~ Catch you later！希望下次还能exchange more brilliant ideas ✨
[B]: How terribly... energetic of you. Do remember that brilliance, like good tea or proper scholarship, cannot be rushed. I'll be in my office should you wish to continue this discourse - third floor, behind the precarious stack of Qing dynasty poetry collections. Mind the loose floorboard by the doorway; it groans like a disappointed thesis advisor. Until then, 再会.
[A]:  等等，你办公室有Qing dynasty poetry？！📜 我下次一定要来browse一下~ 说不定能为我的next exhibition找到perfect theme！现在真的得go了，artist已经开始发emoji storm了 😅 Bye for now！
[B]: How predictably... digital. Very well, but should you visit, do bring proper cotton gloves - my 1793 edition of  deserves more respect than your touchscreen-swiping fingers typically afford. And tell your emoji-flinging artist that excessive punctuation is the hallmark of an unquiet mind... though I suppose in his case, it's literally his medium. 一路顺风.
