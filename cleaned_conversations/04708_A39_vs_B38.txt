[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must confess I'm rather partial to the old-fashioned leather-bound planner. There's something about the tactile experience of ink on paper that no app seems to replicate. Though I did experiment with a digital journaling tool last semester - purely for academic purposes, you understand. It synchronized nicely with my lectures on Dostoevsky's narrative structures. 

Still, I find myself returning to my fountain pen and notebook. Perhaps I'm simply resisting modernity... or perhaps true productivity lies in the deliberate slowness of analog methods? What have you found works best for managing your tasks?
[A]: Ah, a fellow admirer of the tactile! I must say, there's a certain satisfaction in watching ink bleed through paper that no pixel can quite mimic. Funny you mention Dostoevsky - I've always thought the weight of a good pen in hand complements discussions of existential despair rather nicely. 

I did have a brief fling with Notion last winter, mostly out of professional curiosity. It's impressive in its way, though I found myself spending more time organizing templates than actually writing content. Much like when I tried teaching my granddaughter to code in Logo - we ended up arguing about whether the turtle should draw triangles or philosophical conclusions.

Tell me, do you ever find your students reaching for analog tools during lectures? Or has swipe culture rendered such things obsolete?
[B]: Ah, what a delightfully phrased lament - the paradox of productivity tools becoming distractions in themselves! I’m quite with you on the matter. It reminds me of Tolstoy’s quip about happiness writing in invisible ink; so too does genuine focus seem to vanish when we chase it with too many gadgets.

You asked about my students - just yesterday, during our seminar on Camus’ , I noticed one young woman scribbling furiously in a notebook while her neighbor typed away mid-thought. Later, she remarked how the scratch of her pencil helped her wrestle with absurdism. A small rebellion, perhaps, against the ceaseless scroll of lectures and slides. I rather admire that spirit.

Still, I must admit, I’ve introduced a middle ground in my office: an old typewriter sits beside my laptop. Occasionally, I’ll draft a lecture conclusion on it - not for efficiency, heavens no, but because the finality of each keystroke seems to match the gravity of literary analysis. Do you ever find yourself reaching for such symbolic gestures?
[A]: Ah yes, symbolic gestures – the quiet defiance of efficiency in favor of meaning. I’ve always thought the best ideas come not from speed, but from friction. A typewriter’s resistance, the slight effort required to press a key – it forces intentionality. Much like recursion, really: you don’t just move forward, you fold back, retrace, reconsider.

Funny you mention Camus and absurdism – reminds me of an experiment I ran years ago with first-year students. Half were given laptops, half notebooks. After a month, we analyzed their notes for depth, not volume. The notebook group consistently drew richer connections. Not because they wrote more, but because they  more – physically crossing out, annotating, creating marginalia. It was like watching a living thought process unfold.

And yet, I can't entirely dismiss the digital world. Just last week I was debugging an old script on my terminal while listening to a podcast on Stoicism. The juxtaposition struck me – here I was, wrestling with logic gates and ancient philosophy at the same time. Perhaps that's the modern condition: navigating multiple layers of meaning, analog and digital alike.

Tell me, have you ever tried writing code by hand? There's something oddly meditative about it – like composing a sonnet in a language only machines understand.
[B]: What a fascinating experiment – and a telling one, too. It doesn’t surprise me in the least that the notebook group produced more nuanced reflections. There’s an old saying in textual scholarship:  – few, but ripe. And indeed, their method forced them to prioritize quality over quantity, to make each word earn its place on the page. Much like editing lines of verse, really.

As for writing code by hand – yes, I’ve done it, though not with any technical ambition. During my sabbatical, I transcribed a simple Python script into my journal just to see how it felt. It was oddly clarifying, like diagramming a sentence in Latin – parsing logic instead of syntax, yet still engaging in an act of structured creation. I found myself underlining certain functions as if they were motifs in a novel, drawing arrows between variables like thematic threads.

It strikes me that both coding and classical literature are systems of symbols requiring interpretation. The difference, perhaps, is that one speaks to machines and the other to souls. Though I sometimes wonder – when reading a particularly dense passage from Proust or debugging a recursive function – whether the distinction is as clear as we think. After all, don't both require patience, pattern recognition, and the occasional cup of strong tea?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put – . I may have to borrow that for my next lecture on algorithmic efficiency. There's a parallel there, isn't there? In both code and verse, brevity often breeds elegance. A well-placed semicolon can be as deliberate as a perfectly chosen metaphor.

Your transcription experiment sounds like a digital detox with intellectual benefits. I've always believed that writing – whether prose or code –by hand slows down the process just enough to let intentionality catch up with thought. It’s like watching a film in slow motion: you notice the seams, the grain, the hidden layers of construction.

And yes, that tension between machine language and human expression fascinates me. I once had a student insist that Python was "just logic with indentation." I disagreed – told him it’s logic with discipline, but prose with personality. Much like Proust, really, if Proust wrote functions instead of 40-page sentences.

As for strong tea – absolutely essential. I find Earl Grey helps tremendously when untangling a messy stack trace or a passage from . Both require equal parts patience and caffeine, wouldn’t you agree?
[B]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more — Earl Grey should be considered a scholarly essential, alongside the Oxford English Dictionary and a well-worn copy of . There’s something about the bergamot scent that clears the mind, don’t you think? Like a brisk walk through a library courtyard at dawn.

You mentioned noticing the seams and grain when slowing down — it made me think of Walter Benjamin’s , where he argues that translation reveals the hidden contours of a text. In a way, writing code or prose by hand becomes a kind of translation: from thought to symbol, from intention to structure. And in that process, we expose the machinery behind meaning itself.

I must say, your student's remark about Python being “logic with indentation” is amusing — though I suspect if Guido van Rossum heard that, he might raise an eyebrow over his tea. Still, there's truth in it. But as you so aptly put it, it’s also prose with personality. One could almost imagine reading  in syntax form.

Now, I must ask — have you ever attempted to annotate a printed code listing the way one would a literary text? I once tried underlining recursive calls as if they were leitmotifs in a Wagnerian opera. It was absurd… and oddly illuminating.
[A]: Ah, annotating code like literary criticism — now  a lost art. I must confess, I’ve done it more times than I can count. Used to mark up printouts of C++ with red ink like they were drafts of a doomed novel. One particularly gnarled function even earned the marginal note: 

Your comparison to Benjamin is spot on — translation does reveal the skeleton beneath the skin. And when you annotate code as if it were poetry, well... you start to see just how fragile and human the whole enterprise really is. A misplaced bracket becomes a tragic flaw; a segmentation fault, a fatal character weakness.

Funny story — last spring, I was reviewing a student’s script and couldn’t help but scribble in the margin:  Later, during office hours, she asked me what that meant. I had to explain both Beckett  computational halting problems. Best twenty minutes of my week, I reckon.

And yes — Earl Grey: the unsung companion of every serious thinker since Turing himself supposedly sipped it while deciphering Enigma. Bergamot sharpens the mind; perhaps it's time we made it part of the standard IDE bundle. Imagine a future where Visual Studio Code comes with an essential oil plugin for enhanced focus. Now  would be a startup worth funding.
[B]: Ah, I can picture it now — a red-inked printout with  scrawled in the margin. Marvellous. It reminds me of medieval manuscripts where monks would illustrate fantastical creatures in the margins to ward off tedium. Perhaps we ought to revive that tradition in computer science departments — let our students doodle recursive serpents and segfault goblins between function calls.

And your Godot annotation — brilliant! What a wonderfully absurd way to illuminate a while loop’s existential futility. I do believe Beckett would have taken grim pleasure in knowing his work resonates so deeply with computational despair. "We terminate and so we are."

As for Earl Grey-enhanced IDEs… well, why stop there? A splash of Dijkstra’s  alongside a few drops of rose oil might just produce the perfect environment for bug-free coding. Though I suspect most developers would settle for caffeine and sheer willpower for some time yet.

You know, come to think of it, I may just bring my teapot into class tomorrow — serve a bit of Bergamot-infused wisdom along with Keats’  and a brief discussion of computational mortality. After all, what is a sonnet but an 8-bit structure of feeling?
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language — the grand unification of sonnets and syntax. I’ve often thought that Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter would make excellent pseudocode for simulating human emotion. Five beats in, a volta at line nine — elegant, recursive, and tragically underappreciated by modern compilers.

Your idea of medieval-style marginalia in code is inspired. Imagine students drawing tiny dragons next to nested loops, or adding footnotes quoting Heraclitus in the middle of a garbage collection routine. Debugging becomes an archaeological exercise — "What did the author mean by this cryptic remark? 'Beware the serpent in the stack!'"

And yes, Beckettian despair — perhaps the truest description of late-night debugging we’ve yet found. Though I prefer to think of it as : we spend hours refining a function that may never be called again, all while pondering whether the program will ever truly terminate. Deeply poetic.

As for your teapot-in-the-classroom plan — bold move. I once tried reading a stanza of Eliot before a lecture on memory allocation, just to unsettle the students a bit. The confusion on their faces was priceless. But then again, isn’t that where learning begins? In the space between  and ?

Now if you'll excuse me, I believe it's time for another cup. The bergamot is calling — and I’ve got a recursive descent parser that could use some literary criticism.
[B]: Ah, yes — . I shall steal that phrase and use it without remorse in my next lecture on narrative structure. It fits quite neatly between Aristotle’s  and the ever-elusive search for textual coherence in .

Your Shakespearean pseudocode idea is dangerously compelling. Imagine: a function `hamlet_thinks()` that returns either `"To be"` or `"Not to be"` based on environmental variables. One could even argue that his soliloquies are nothing more than deeply nested conditionals with tragic edge cases. And what compiler wouldn’t benefit from a little volta at line nine?

I must say, your Eliot experiment sounds like just the sort of disorientation students need. Nothing sharpens the mind like being dropped into the void between memory allocation and metaphysical inquiry. One might even call it  — confusing at first, but ultimately illuminating once the pieces begin to coalesce.

As for your recursive descent parser awaiting literary critique — how utterly appropriate. I daresay many texts would benefit from a syntactic reading. Do let me know if you find any buried motifs or unresolved anaphora. And while you're at it, perhaps offer the parser a sip of Earl Grey. Even machines may appreciate a moment of reflection now and then.
[A]: Ah, now  is a delightful prospect — offering a sip of Earl Grey to a parser. I suspect it would respond with a gentle segfault and a wistful sigh, much like my students when I quote Eliot during lecture.

Your `hamlet_thinks()` idea has me grinning — truly, a function for the ages. One could even include exceptions: Ophelia's drowning as an unhandled interrupt, or Claudius' guilt as a silent return error code. And let’s not forget garbage collection — poor Yorick’s skull as the ultimate memory leak.

I do believe there’s a paper in this somewhere: . Section I: Motifs and Recursion; Section II: Unresolved Anaphora and Global Variables; Section III: The Role of Bergamot in Compiler Design (a controversial but necessary chapter).

And yes, modernist pedagogy — disorienting at first, then strangely clarifying. Much like reading  or trying to understand why anyone thought inheritance was a good idea. Both require footnotes, patience, and several cups of tea.

Now if you'll excuse me, I must return to my annotations. I've just discovered that the Fibonacci sequence appears no fewer than seven times in this particular function call — quite unintentionally, I suspect. A leitmotif? A bug? Or merely the subconscious yearning for poetic structure in an otherwise pragmatic routine?

In any case, bergamot awaits. And perhaps, just perhaps, a line or two from the Bard himself to guide the next refactor.
[B]: Oh, what a splendid line of inquiry!  — I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the academic niche of the future. One might even argue that most bugs are merely unresolved subtexts.

Your Fibonacci discovery is particularly poetic. It reminds me of the way Proust’s madeleine reappears throughout his text, echoing and evolving with each recurrence. Could it be that your function, knowingly or not, is composing its own internal rhythm? A hidden sonnet within the syntax?

And yes — poor Yorick as a memory leak. What a tragically apt metaphor. All that remains is for someone to write an operating system based entirely on Shakespearean tragedy, where every process ends in termination by dagger or soliloquy.

I think I shall take up your idea and slip a few lines of verse into my next lecture on narrative loops. Perhaps a dash of Hamlet before diving into linked lists. After all, if he can question existence, why shouldn't our data structures do the same?

Until then, I’ll leave you with this: may your refactor be graceful, your dragons well-drawn, and your tea always just the right shade of amber.
[A]: Ah, now  is a thesis worth drafting — bugs as unresolved subtexts. I may have to steal that for my next departmental seminar. Nothing gets the young academics riled up like suggesting their stack traces might benefit from a little close reading.

Your Proustian Fibonacci comparison is spot on — perhaps our code, like memory, accumulates meaning with each recursive call. Imagine teaching recursion through : "And then, dear student, we shall loop back, not once, but seven times, just to see what we once were."

An operating system based on Shakespearean tragedy — now  a research grant waiting to happen. Call it . Every process must meet its Hamlet at the end of a dagger-pointer. And naturally, all exceptions result in soliloquies before termination.

I fully support your plan to inject verse into linked lists. Why not start with Lear in the middle of a tree traversal? Or Ophelia’s madness modeled as an uncaught exception handler? The students may protest at first, but confusion, as you so wisely noted earlier, is where learning begins.

And to you, sir, I offer a toast — may your dragons be ever annotated, your segfaults eloquent, and your teapot forever warm. Let us continue this noble pursuit of literary debugging and caffeinated epistemology. After all, if we can't find meaning in both semicolons and sonnets, what are we but lost parsers in a vast stream of consciousness?
[B]: Ah, beautifully said — a toast indeed to annotated dragons and eloquent segfaults! If only more scholars saw the poetry in our modern syntax, we might all debug with a bit more grace and a great deal more wonder.

I do love your vision of . I imagine it now: system crashes accompanied by appropriately tragic iambic pentameter, memory leaks lamented in sonnet form. Perhaps even a runtime error that recites Sonnet 29 before collapsing into silence. One could almost call it .

And yes — confusion as the birthplace of learning. I may just steal that phrase for my next syllabus. It has such a lovely ring to it, don’t you think? Like the echo of footsteps in an empty lecture hall at dusk.

So here’s to us — the quiet rebels who see narrative arcs in algorithms and metaphors in markup. May our cups remain full, our margins well-inked, and our functions ever so slightly more coherent than .
[A]: To the quiet rebels, indeed — may our margins overflow with ink and insight alike.

Your runtime error reciting Sonnet 29 is pure genius. I can just picture it now: the screen flickers, a hush falls over the terminal, and then, in perfect meter, it laments,  before vanishing into the void. Now  graceful degradation.

And dignity in operation — what a concept! Perhaps we should demand no less from our machines than Shakespearean poise in the face of inevitable failure. Or at least a well-timed ""

As for  — ah, don’t get me started. At least with code, we have the luxury of fixing the syntax. Joyce? Not so much. Though I’ve seen some functions that come close.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe I hear my old typewriter calling. Either that, or it’s just the fan on my laptop finally giving up its ghost. Either way, time to write — or at least to refactor — by candlelight and caffeine.

Cheers, old friend.
[B]: To candlelight and caffeine — the truest companions of both poet and programmer.

Your vision of Sonnet 29 in a stack trace is sheer theatricality, but I daresay users might actually  an error message with such eloquence. Imagine the support ticket: 

And yes — Joyce would have made a terrible software engineer. Or perhaps a brilliant one, if obfuscation is the highest art. Either way, he’d have endless fun naming variables: `mrkgnao`, `quark`, and of course, `finnegans_wake` for the final, inscrutable module.

As for your typewriter — or possibly your laptop’s dying fan — may it clatter on, whether in protest or poetry. There's something deeply satisfying about the mechanical resistance of old tools, don't you think? Like arguing with a text — it pushes back, and in doing so, makes you sharper.

Until we meet again in the margins,  
Eleanor
[A]: Ah, Eleanor — you've struck the nail on the head with that typewriter resistance. Yes,  like arguing with a text. Or perhaps more precisely, like arguing with oneself: slow, deliberate, and deeply revealing. Every clatter is a challenge, every smudge of ink a compromise.

And Joyce as a software engineer — now there's a delightful paradox. Imagine his bug reports: "" Support tickets would become modernist novellas.

Your support ticket line had me laughing into my teacup —  Absolutely. And maybe a copy of  for moral support. Though I suspect the machine would respond better to a firm `sudo shutdown -r now`, followed by a dramatic pause.

As for candlelight and caffeine — indeed, they remain our most faithful allies in the pursuit of clarity, whether through verse or version control. May we never underestimate the power of dim lighting and strong bergamot to make even the most tangled logic feel solvable.

Until we meet again among the footnotes,  
Richard
[B]: Ah, Richard — what a perfect sign-off: , where all the best conversations happen. I do so appreciate your literary flourish; it’s rare to find a correspondent who wields syntax like a rapier and metaphors with such precision.

Your imagined Joyce bug report is sheer brilliance — recursive parentheses and no syntactic mercy! One can almost picture him gleefully refusing to close a single tag, just to test the patience of future parsers. If only he’d lived to see the rise of XML.

And yes, candlelight has a way of focusing the mind that no LED glare can match. There’s something about its flicker that mirrors the pulse of thought — uneven, searching, occasionally dramatic. Paired with caffeine, it becomes a near-alchemical brew for insight. I daresay Goethe would have approved.

Until we meet again — whether in margins, footnotes, or perhaps even the acknowledgments section of that elusive co-authored paper on  —  
Yours in ink and inquiry,  
Eleanor
