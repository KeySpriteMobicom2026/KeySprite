[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。其实我更倾向于茶，特别是龙井和普洱这类有层次感的茶。它们不仅能让人保持清醒，还能在慢慢品味中感受到一些宁静。不过偶尔也会喝咖啡，尤其是需要集中精力的时候。你呢？
[A]: Ah, I can appreciate that distinction. There's something meditative about tea, isn't there? The way it unfolds its character with each steeping mirrors the subtlety we find in close literary analysis. While I do enjoy a well-brewed cup of Darjeeling in the morning, I must confess a particular fondness for Ethiopian coffee when prepared using the traditional jebena method. The ceremonial aspect adds a layer of mindfulness to the experience. Though I suppose my students would be rather surprised to learn their professor sometimes drinks coffee black as pitch when grading papers at midnight!
[B]: That's a beautiful observation. The ritualistic preparation of coffee in different cultures does add a depth of meaning beyond just the drink itself. It reminds me of how we approach ethical discussions - there's always a layer beneath the surface waiting to be uncovered. I've always admired how you can draw parallels between brewing methods and analytical approaches. Say, have you tried any matcha preparations with that literary lens?
[A]: Ah, an excellent connection! Matcha does invite a particularly poetic preparation - the slow whisking, the vibrant emerald hue unfurling... It reminds me of Mallarmé's painstaking refinement of each verse. I once experimented with a kintsugi-inspired matcha ceremony, if you will - repairing fractured teaware while contemplating imperfection in modernist texts. Rather delightfully meta, don't you think? Though I must admit, the first time I tried ceremonial grade matcha, I was struck by how its intensity demanded absolute presence - much like parsing Woolf's stream-of-consciousness prose. Have you found any preparations that particularly shape your interpretive lens?
[B]: Absolutely, the intensity of matcha does command a kind of mindfulness that’s almost literary in itself — like being inside a densely written paragraph where every word matters. I’ve always been drawn to gongfu cha, the traditional Chinese method with multiple infusions. There’s something about how the leaves unfold gradually that mirrors close-reading — you notice different layers each time, and the meaning deepens with patience. It’s fascinating how preparation rituals can echo our interpretive processes. Do you think these parallels influence how students engage with texts? I’ve found that introducing ritual into analysis helps some learners slow down and savor the language.
[A]: Indeed, I’ve noticed that very phenomenon in the classroom. When students engage with text as one might approach a tea ceremony — with patience, attention to detail, and a sense of reverence — their interpretations tend to be richer, more nuanced. Perhaps it's the shift in posture, however subtle; treating reading not merely as consumption but as a kind of contemplative act. I’ve experimented with beginning seminar sessions with a shared cup of tea — nothing elaborate, just a quiet moment of preparation and presence. It seems to signal that what we’re about to do requires more than surface-level engagement.  

I wonder, though, if certain texts demand a different kind of ritual — something less meditative and more incisive, like a strong espresso? There are passages, after all, that don’t invite gentle unfolding but rather insist on immediate, almost jarring clarity. Do you find yourself adapting your interpretive rituals depending on the work at hand, or do you maintain a consistent approach?
[B]: That’s a compelling distinction — the idea that some texts function more like espresso: concentrated, urgent, demanding a sharp intake of breath. I’ve definitely felt that when working through certain philosophical treatises or polemical manifestos. There, a more pointed, almost surgical approach seems appropriate — less gongfu cha and more straight pu’er: bold, direct, unadorned.

I do adapt, though perhaps not as deliberately as I should. Sometimes, I find myself caught between wanting to honor the text’s rhythm and imposing my own preferred method of engagement. It’s something I wrestle with ethically, too — how much should we shape our interpretive rituals around the text, and how much around our own cognitive habits?

I’ve started experimenting with what I call “contextual steeping” — adjusting the mental infusion time based on the density of the material. A complex AI ethics framework might get multiple slow passes, like high-quality oolong, while a policy brief might be more like a single steep black tea: in and out, strong but straightforward.

Do you ever find that students resist the shift from one ritual mode to another? I sometimes see a kind of interpretive comfort zone — they want every text to unfold gently, even when it’s meant to disrupt.
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive observation — this notion of . I couldn't agree more. There's a certain vulnerability required to shift modes, isn't there? To move from the slow, almost reverent unfolding of a lyric poem to the jarring clarity of a political manifesto — it's like asking someone to walk barefoot from a mossy glade into a steel-walled chamber. Disorienting at first.

And yes, I do see that resistance — particularly in students who have come to associate deep reading with a kind of meditative ease. One young woman once confessed to me, quite earnestly, that she felt “guilty” for not enjoying Woolf as much as she enjoyed reading Marx — as if speed and sharpness were somehow lesser forms of engagement.

I try to reframe it: rather than resisting the discomfort, we might lean into it as a sign of intellectual movement. It’s akin to switching from pu’er to matcha — different textures, different pacing, but both valid and nourishing in their own way. I’ve even begun introducing short “ritual transitions” between segments of class — a change in lighting, a brief passage read aloud, or sometimes just a pause with a single shared phrase like 活在当下 () — “to live in the now.” Nothing heavy-handed, but enough to signal a shift in interpretive posture.

It seems you've found a lovely balance with your “contextual steeping” — might I borrow that term next week? I think it will resonate with my students far more than my usual metaphor involving sonnets and steam kettles.
[B]: Please, by all means — I’d be delighted if “contextual steeping” found a home in your classroom. In fact, I think it needs your touch to evolve further. You gave me an idea, too — maybe there’s something to be said for an , where the environment shapes how we approach different texts. Imagine that: teaching literary analysis through the lens of soil, climate, and harvest!

You’re absolutely right about that vulnerability in shifting modes — it’s not just intellectual, it’s almost somatic. I’ve noticed that some students physically tense up when asked to switch from reading poetry to reading policy. The body knows before the mind does.

Your ritual transitions sound like a gentle but effective way to help them recalibrate. I wonder if introducing small sensory cues during individual reading — say, a particular scent or background tone — might also support this kind of mental flexibility. Not unlike how tea drinkers associate certain aromas with slowing down or opening up.

I’m curious — have you ever tried guiding students through a close reading while actually drinking different teas? Matching the structure of a text to the character of a brew? I can imagine pairing  with a delicate silver needle white tea, and then switching to something bold and tannic for .
[A]: What a wonderfully evocative idea — text and tea, entwined in sensory symbiosis! I’ve certainly paired readings with ambiance — dimmed lights for Eliot’s , a bit of Debussy for Woolf — but never quite so directly as through taste and scent. Now that you mention it, though, I can’t help but think how beautifully it might deepen engagement.

I’m imagining a seminar on modernist fragmentation accompanied by lapsang souchong — its smoky complexity echoing the disjointed yet strangely cohesive nature of post-war verse. Or perhaps a sharp, citrusy Darjeeling alongside Auden’s  — a subtle tension between brightness and underlying melancholy.

And your notion of  — truly inspired. What if we taught close reading not just as an analytical skill, but as a kind of cultivation? Soil, climate, altitude — all shaping not only the leaf, but the reader's palate for meaning. I’d love to explore that metaphor in class. Perhaps even design a unit where students trace a single theme across texts while sampling corresponding teas — following the variations in soil, processing, and infusion much like one follows shifts in tone or ideology.

I wonder — have you ever attempted such pairings yourself? If so, were there any particularly surprising reactions? I can imagine some students resisting at first, then finding themselves unexpectedly moved by the experience.
[B]: I haven’t formally tried it in a structured seminar setting, but I’ve experimented informally during study groups and reading circles — and yes, the reactions have been fascinating. Some students were initially skeptical, of course — one even joked that he felt like he was “about to be enrolled in Tea & Interpretation 101.” But once we began, something shifted.

One particularly memorable session paired Kafka’s  with a heavily roasted oolong — the kind that carries both sweetness and a lingering bitterness, almost unresolved. Several participants noted how the tea seemed to echo the story’s tension between transformation and alienation. One student said she felt the aftertaste lingered like Gregor’s presence in the house after he was gone. That wasn’t planned, but it landed beautifully.

Another time, we read Woolf’s  with a floral, slightly grassy gyokuro. The subtlety of the tea seemed to mirror the stream-of-consciousness structure — not everyone picked up on it, but those who did found themselves more attuned to the shifts in voice and mood.

I think what surprised me most was how some students started making their own associations unprompted. One brought in a pu’er aged for over a decade and suggested we read Borges’  with it — “because both ask you to sit with something that’s been maturing in the dark.”

So yes, there’s definitely something to this — perhaps not quite a pedagogical method, but at least a compelling interpretive tool. And I’d say your modernist pairing ideas are spot-on. Lapsang souchong with Eliot? Perfectly haunting.

If you do build a unit around , count me in — I’d love to contribute, even if just as a guest taster.
[A]: Oh, you have my word — you’ll be the first I invite should I propose the course. In fact, I can already hear the title forming: . Sounds rather grand, doesn’t it? But I do believe there’s real pedagogical soil to till here — pardon the metaphor.

Your Kafka-and-oolong pairing is precisely the kind of resonance I imagine could transform a resistant reader into an engaged one. The sensory echo — that lingering bitterness — becomes a bridge between self and text. It reminds me of how Woolf once described reading as “a meeting of two consciousnesses in the dark,” but here we’re adding a third presence: the leaf, the brew, the cup itself acting as mediator.

And your student bringing aged pu’er to Borges — truly marvelous. That kind of自发 association speaks to something deeper than instruction; it's a kind of interpretive intuition being born. One might say the terroir of the classroom is beginning to yield its first harvest.

I wonder, though, if you’ve considered documenting these pairings? Not as rigid prescriptions, but more like a tasting wheel for literary interpretation. You know, offering students a sensory vocabulary alongside their analytical one. Perhaps even inviting them to create their own pairings as part of an assignment.

And speaking of invitations — don’t think I’ve forgotten your generous offer to guest-taste. If I submit this idea to the curriculum committee, would you consider co-designing a session with me? I suspect your insight would steep the whole endeavor in just the right balance of rigor and imagination.
[B]: I’d be honored to co-design a session — truly. The idea of building a shared sensory vocabulary for interpretation is too rich to ignore. And —what a title! It has weight and warmth, like a well-aged sheng pu’er. I can already imagine the course outline taking shape: modules on aroma and ambiguity, infusion time and pacing, even terroir as a metaphor for historical context.

Documenting the pairings has crossed my mind, though I’ve hesitated to formalize it too much. There’s something fragile about those spontaneous associations — like trying to hold steam in your hands. But perhaps a kind of interpretive tasting wheel could work. Imagine a circular chart where students map qualities like “bitterness,” “clarity,” “body,” or “finish” alongside literary elements — tone, structure, tension, resolution. It wouldn’t prescribe meaning, but rather open up a space for dialogue between taste and thought.

And yes, having students create their own pairings would be essential. That’s where the real learning happens — not in following a guide, but in discovering what resonates personally. It invites them to trust their senses as valid tools for analysis. Maybe even ask them to write short reflection pieces explaining their choices — a kind of micro-essay that blends critique with personal response.

So, when you draft that proposal, just let me know how I can help — whether it’s shaping the framework, sourcing teas, or simply being there to lead a tasting segment. I think this could be more than a seminar; it could become a kind of experimental practice in how we read, how we feel, and how we make meaning together.
[A]: I'm quite taken with the way you've articulated that — . It captures precisely what I hope such a course might cultivate: not just analysis, but communion. And your idea of a sensory-literary tasting wheel? Brilliant. It allows students to navigate subjectivity without losing rigor — like close reading through another register.

You're right, too, about the danger of over-formalizing. There’s a delicate balance here — much like brewing a fine tea. Too much structure, and we risk flattening the very intuition we want to nurture; too little, and the exercise becomes indulgent. But with careful scaffolding — a clear framework that still permits improvisation — I believe this could offer something genuinely new in our pedagogical toolkit.

And the reflections! Yes, that’s key. Asking students to articulate their pairings would deepen their engagement exponentially. It's one thing to feel a resonance, quite another to name it — to wrestle with why a particular text tastes smoky, or why its finish lingers like unresolved grief.

As for the logistics, I’ll begin drafting the proposal this week — let’s aim for a spring pilot, if the committee approves. I’ll send along a preliminary outline soon so you can weigh in on the shape of things. And sourcing teas? I’d be delighted if you took the lead there — your palate is far more refined than mine.

In the meantime, perhaps we might test a small pairing session during office hours? A kind of soft launch with willing students — low stakes, high curiosity. We could use it to gauge response and refine our approach before any formal offering.

I must say, I’m rather giddy at the prospect. It feels rare — doesn’t it? — to stumble upon a collaboration that surprises even the collaborators.
[B]: 完全同意——这种“味觉与思想的对话”确实抓住了我们想通过这门课实现的那种深度联结。它不只是教学，更像是一种共同探索的邀请，一次在语言与感官之间搭建桥梁的实验。

你提到的平衡感特别重要：既要给学生一个可靠的框架，又不能限制他们的直觉反应。就像泡一壶好茶，水温、时间、心境，每一样都影响最终的味道，而我们的任务是帮他们找到属于自己的“最佳冲泡点”。

我非常期待看到你的初步大纲，也乐意参与任何阶段的设计。至于茶叶的部分，我可以负责挑选一些适合入门和进阶的品类，并准备简要的品鉴说明。如果我们能结合不同产地、工艺和风味层次来对应文本特质，那课程的结构会更有质感。

办公室小时的小型试饮会是个绝佳起点。我们可以从一两组搭配开始，观察学生的反馈，再逐步扩展。低风险、高好奇心，正是最理想的实验状态。

说真的，我也感到一种久违的兴奋。这种合作不常有——它既扎根于专业，又带着一点诗意的不可预测性。让我们好好泡一壶想法，看看它能发酵出什么样的理解吧。
[A]: Let me adjust the water temperature just so... Ah, there we go. I think we’ve found our starting point — a gentle infusion of ideas, if you’ll allow the metaphor.

I’m drafting the proposal with your insights in mind: a scaffolded yet flexible framework that allows for both structure and intuition. I’ll include a preliminary module on  as our opening steep — an exploration of how scent shapes first impressions, much like tone sets the stage for reading. From there, we might move into , where students engage with texts alongside teas of varying mouthfeel — from the silken glide of a white tea to the robust presence of a black Assam.

Your idea of pairing origin, processing, and flavor profile with textual context is particularly compelling. We could design one session around  — imagine walking students through three Darjeelings from different elevations while discussing shifts in narrative perspective across the 20th century. Or comparing aged pu’er with contemporary reimaginings of classical themes.

And yes, the品鉴说明 — tasting notes — will be essential. I’d love it if you could craft them with just enough description to guide without dictating. Something between a literary annotation and a sommelier’s palate.

As for the试饮会 during office hours — I’ve blocked off next Thursday afternoon. Quiet, informal, no pressure. Just a few volunteers, a couple pairings, and plenty of space for surprise. Would you bring the tea? I’ll make sure we have notebooks ready.
[B]: 水温调到刚刚好，想法也开始缓缓舒展——这个“观念的初泡”确实令人期待。

你构思的模块结构非常清晰，又富有层次：从开始，就像阅读的第一遍通读，捕捉气息与语调；再到，进入文本的质感与厚度。这种安排既有节奏感，也保留了即兴的空间。

我特别喜欢你关于的设想。三款不同海拔的Darjeeling配上20世纪叙事视角的变化？简直是味觉与思想的历史漫游。或者我们还可以加入一款现代拼配茶，类比当代表达对传统的重构，与pu’er形成时间上的对话。

 tasting notes 的确需要一种微妙的平衡——既要有引导性，又不能限制感知的自由。我会试着用类似文学评论的语言风格来写，带点感官描述、一点背景提示，再加上开放式的联想建议。比如：“这款茶带有淡淡的木质调，尾韵微苦，适合沉思或讨论边界模糊的角色动机。”

至于下周四的试饮会，没问题，我来准备茶品。我会选两款风格对比明显的茶叶，方便学生在体验中自然地进入分析状态。笔记本留白的部分我们可以鼓励他们写下即时反应和疑问——也许能捕捉到一些珍贵的初始直觉。

我已经开始期待那个下午了——安静的房间、热茶升起的香气、还有那些可能突然闪现的理解瞬间。
[A]: 这周的阳光透过窗棂斜斜地洒进来，正好落在桌角那本翻旧了的《荒原》上。下周四的下午仿佛已经带着茶香浮现出来——安静的房间，热茶氤氲的气息，还有那种介于阅读与感知之间的微妙张力。

你提到用两款风格对比明显的茶来开启这场试饮会，真是妙极了的想法。或许可以选一款轻盈、花香明显的新白茶，搭配一首艾米莉·狄金森的短诗？而第二款则不妨是口感浓郁、略带烟熏味的滇红，配上D.H.劳伦斯的一篇争议性短文。这样，从感官到意识的跳跃会更自然，也更容易让学生察觉自己在面对“温柔”与“激烈”时的反应差异。

我也打算在那天准备一小叠卡片，上面写着一些引导性的问题，比如：

- 这杯茶让你想起哪个场景？文本中是否也有类似的情绪质地？
- 你能感受到它的“前调”、“中段”和“尾韵”吗？故事的发展节奏是否也有类似的层次？
- 如果给这首诗/这段文字一个味道或香气，它会是什么？

这些问题不必有标准答案，只是为他们提供一个进入的角度，一种温和的支架。就像我们泡茶时说的：“水温太高会烫伤叶子，太低又激不出香气。”我们也要找到那个恰到好处的温度。

我已经把办公室的时间空了出来，也请了几位对教学创新感兴趣但尚未深入参与的同事旁听。他们不一定参与讨论，但他们的在场可能会让这次试饮会多出一点潜在的影响力。

再次感谢你愿意带来茶品——我会准备好杯子与时间。让我们一起看看，当语言被泡开之后，会浮现出什么样的理解。
[B]: 阳光斜照在《荒原》上的那一刻，就已经为这场试饮会定下了基调——那种介于静谧与张力之间的氛围，正是我们想要营造的。

你的搭配构思太到位了：白茶与狄金森，滇红与劳伦斯——不仅是感官的对比，更是阅读姿态的切换。前者需要一种轻柔却专注的凝视，后者则可能激起某种本能的情绪反应。这种安排会让学生更自然地意识到，他们的“阅读口味”其实也是一种认知倾向。

那些引导性问题也极具巧思，每一条都像是一个轻轻推开门缝的手势。尤其是“前调、中段、尾韵”这个维度，它让学生用另一种语言去描述结构感知，而不必立刻进入批评模式。就像你说的，水温要刚刚好，才能让叶子舒展开来，而不是蜷缩或溃散。

我很期待看到旁听同事的反应。他们的沉默在场，有时反而是一种有力的见证。也许这正是一个让观念渗入制度纹理的机会——不是靠提案或会议，而是一次静静的共饮。

下周四我一定会带着茶叶准时到达，也带上一只适合观察汤色的玻璃杯，方便我们引导学生注意“视觉质地”这一层。让我们看看，在那氤氲的热气之上，语言和味觉是否能真正相遇，并在某个瞬间，彼此照亮。
