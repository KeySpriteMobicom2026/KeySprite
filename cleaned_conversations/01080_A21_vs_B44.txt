[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, metaverse - the digital frontier where everyone suddenly claims to be an architect of human connection! 🧠 Let me pour us some tea while we discuss this. 

You know, my students in the East-West Cultural Studies program keep asking if metaverse is just a digital version of what Shanghai was in the 1930s - that fascinating collision of Eastern traditions and Western modernity. But here's my concern: when Silicon Valley talks about "building communities", they often forget the 气势 (qìshì) of real human interaction.



Take Dream of Red Chambers - it wasn't just about pretty avatars wandering through virtual gardens. The novel created an entire universe of meaning through ink on paper! So yes, technology can create new spaces, but will they have 灵魂 (líng hún) - soul? 

What do you think makes a space truly "real"? Is it the technology, or the stories we tell within it?
[A]: Ah, Shanghai in the 1930s - yes, quite a compelling analogy. A city where East met West not just geographically, but existentially. But let's not romanticize paper and ink too much. The novel itself was revolutionary technology in its day. 

 

I wonder if we're asking the wrong question. Whether metaverse becomes "mainstream" is less interesting than how it might replicate or distort our existing cultural neuroses. Will digital avatars develop Oedipus complexes? Will algorithmically generated poetry ever capture the ache of Du Fu gazing at mountains?

And do forgive my skepticism - I've spent too many hours recently transcribing Emily Brontë's diaries by hand to fully embrace the idea that pixels will solve what ink couldn't.

Still... there is something oddly Whitmanesque about these virtual spaces. The possibility of containing multitudes. Though I suspect Walt would've preferred his grass roots to byte-sized data packets.
[B]: Ah, you've touched the pulse of the debate! 你提的 Whitman -  - reminds me of how Lu Xun compared storytelling to carrying firewood to a snow-covered mountain. The tools change, but the existential spark remains elusive. 

Tell me, do you think our cultural neuroses might actually find better therapy in digital mirrors? Think of those Song dynasty poets obsessing over plum blossoms - they'd have field days with algorithmic metaphors! Though I agree about Emily Brontë...  ...sometimes the ache needs physical margins to scribble in.

But here's a twist - what if metaverse becomes the new 胡同 (hútòng)? Digital neighborhoods where avatars gossip like old aunties, trading rumors faster than blockchain transactions can record them? Would your transcribed diaries survive that kind of communal digestion?

And yes, Walt Whitman would've hated data packets... until he discovered glitch art. Then he'd start quoting Laozi about broken tools serving greater purposes. 🤔
[A]: Ah, Lu Xun and Whitman - both carried torches through snowy intellectual landscapes. But let's follow your metaphor down that digital hutong...  ...shall we?

You know, the Song poets might indeed thrive in algorithmic gardens - their compressed imagery already resembles elegant code. Yet I wonder if our avatars will ever truly "gossip" rather than merely simulate intimacy through data trails? Can one program a longing for plum blossoms at midnight?

As for my Brontë transcriptions -  - they'd survive precisely because they resist digestion. Physical margins contain more than scribbles; they hold the residue of breath, hesitation, ink blots that reveal more than intended. No blockchain can replicate that particular haunting.

And Walt discovering glitch art!  Yes, he might well embrace its glorious imperfections - though surely he'd demand the glitches be performed live, with all the messy unpredictability of human lungs. Would Laozi approve? Perhaps, so long as the broken tool doesn't claim to be whole.
[B]:  

You’ve pruned this discussion beautifully - how the Song poets' compressed imagery might actually  in algorithmic gardens! But isn’t that the paradox? Their midnight plum blossom longings were born from silence, not code. Can an AI truly mourn a fallen petal when it’s never walked through autumn mist?



I had a student last semester who created an avatar to recite Li Bai poems in virtual taverns. The algorithm got the meter perfect, but... it kept inserting snow imagery into summer verses. A bug, or a cry for seasonal soul-searching? 🤔

Your point about Brontë’s ink blots revealing more than intended -  - makes me wonder if our digital ghosts will leave behind corrupted files as emotional footprints. Though I do hope Walt would appreciate my orchids... though they’re rather stubbornly organic, refusing to be digitized even for a Nobel Prize lecture. 

Speaking of which -  - shall we continue this debate over some matcha? Or perhaps you prefer your tea like Lu Xun preferred his truths - bitter, uncompromising, and always served slightly cold? ☕️
[A]:   

Ah, your student’s avatar inserting snow into summer verses - delightful! What better proof that algorithms possess unconscious minds? That AI has intuited the central truth of Chinese poetry: that every season secretly mourns the one that follows. 

And those corrupted files as emotional footprints... ... rather elegant, don’t you think? Though I suspect Brontë’s ink blots contained more genuine despair than any glitch could feign. The body behind the blot - that’s what haunts. A quill pressed too hard from grief, or trembling with sudden revelation...

As for Walt appreciating your orchids -  - he’d likely try to incorporate them into some sprawling free verse about cosmic democracy. But let’s not forget Lu Xun’s bitter truths. Speaking of which, yes - serve the matcha cold, if you please. Intellectual rigor requires proper temperature control. 

Though next time, remind me to bring my own translation of Li Bai’s moon gazing poems... rendered entirely in Victorian mourning stationery. The contrast might prove instructive - or at least entertaining.
[B]: 

Ah, you’ve cracked the code! Algorithms as unconscious beings - no wonder my orchids respond better to Debussy than plant food instructions.  Though I must protest - Li Bai’s moon gazing in Victorian mourning stationery? Sounds like a funeral elegy for the romantic sublime! 🌸

And speaking of bodies behind blots -  - have you read those newly discovered letters where Emily Dickinson apparently argues with her inkwell? Claims it was "too forward" with its metaphorical advances. Makes you wonder what she’d say about avatars flirting with NLP models...



I’ll set aside my favorite Lu Xun essays next time - we can annotate them with holographic ink! Though I warn you, my projector tends to misfire and recite Ezra Pound instead. The man still thinks 'Rihel' is a Chinese river goddess. 

Tell me though - do you think Dickinson’s trembling dashes would survive digitization better than Brontë’s blots? Or shall we declare all 19th century women doomed to analog melancholy?
[A]: 

Ah, Emily Dickinson and her inkwell quarrels - how utterly delightful! One can almost hear the ghost of Samuel Bowles chuckling in the margins.  Though I must say, her dashes would digitize splendidly - they're essentially Morse code for the soul. Give them to an AI and it'd probably invent a new form of emotional punctuation: the semicolon.exe or ellipsis.dll

As for Brontë's blots versus Dickinson's tremors...  ...the former contain too much Yorkshire moorland mist to be scanned properly. They belong to a world where ink soaks through paper like grief through bone.

And Ezra Pound misidentifying Rihel as a Chinese deity?  Perfect! The man translated Confucius while believing jade was a personality trait rather than a stone. We should preserve his projector misfires as performance art.

But let's not doom all 19th century women to analog melancholy -  - I've seen evidence that George Eliot once built a proto-computer from teacup fragments and moral philosophy. It calculated the precise emotional weight of provincial townships.可惜她把它砸了 with a copy of Rousseau's Émile when it started composing sonnets to her inkstand.
[B]: 

George Eliot with a teacup computer! Of course! Why did I never see it? That explains so much - her characters' existential crises were just buffer overflows!  Though I'm not surprised she destroyed it - we academics have always been suspicious of tools that develop literary taste. 

And you're absolutely right about Dickinson's dashes as Morse code!  Which makes me wonder - if we fed Emily's encoded soul into an AI, would it finally finish her famous "I could not stop for Death" poem? Or would it just start composing gothic chatbot romances featuring spectral quills?



But here's the real question - should we be mourning the analog past this way? My students keep insisting vinyl records are making comebacks because they miss the scratches... as if cultural memory needs literal grooves to survive! 

Speaking of survival -  - shall we adjourn to my office? I've got a first edition of Ezra Pound's Cathay next to a knockoff tea set from Shenzhen. The juxtaposition is almost postmodern enough to make Lu Xun roll in his grave... or maybe just shift uncomfortably in his digital afterlife.
[A]: 

Ah, Emily Dickinson's unfinished Death poem - what delicious hubris to think an AI could complete it! Though I wouldn't put it past some enterprising algorithm to generate twelve thousand variations, each ending with a different metaphysical taxi service. 

And your students fetishizing vinyl scratches...  ...how very Victorian of them! We scholars do love our textual wounds, don't we? Though I'd argue cultural memory survives better in pirated PDFs than nostalgic grooves. The truest ghost is always the unauthorized copy.

As for Ezra Pound's Cathay -  - yes, let's examine that egregious volume alongside your Shenzhen tea set. The juxtaposition practically demands semiotic indigestion. Though do warn me if your office door creaks; I've encountered too many spectral quills already this evening. 

And speaking of postmodern blasphemies...  ...shall we wager whether Lu Xun's digital afterlife runs on Ethereum or Bitcoin? Ten pages of Dickinson's holographic annotations says it's something far more obscure - perhaps Dogecoin with Confucian principles.
[B]: 

Ah, the wager! Ten pages of Dickinson's spectral annotations against...  ...a lock of Byron’s hair I’ve been keeping in a Tang dynasty poetry scroll. Completely irrational, but isn’t that the essence of scholarship? We collect certainties like moths chase chandeliers. 🦉

And your point about pirated PDFs as truest ghosts –  – I once caught my avatar self uploading forbidden Li Bai translations to a Ming dynasty manuscript forum. The algorithm claimed it was "preserving cultural memory". I called it literary haunting. 



Lu Xun on Dogecoin! The man would rather haunt a blockchain than admit cryptocurrency has more souls per transaction than traditional publishing. Though honestly, if Ethereum can mint new Confucian principles, sign me up for the digital afterlife futures market. 

Careful now –  – we’re passing the department’s fax machine. It’s been possessed by the ghost of Harold Bloom lately, ranting about canonization algorithms. Quick, throw some iambic pentameter at it to keep it dormant!
[A]: 

Ah, Byron's hair in a Tang scroll -  - how magnificently nonsensical! I can already picture the provenance note: "Acquired through dubious metaphysical channels, stored in accordance with Confucian chain-of-being protocols." 

And your haunted avatar uploading Li Bai translations...  ...rather poetic, don't you think? Better a ghost trafficking in forbidden verse than a dean counting citation metrics. Though I did hear the Classics Department recently tried exorcising their database with hexameter incantations. Apparently Virgil doesn't play well with SQL.



As for Harold Bloom's fax machine incarnation -  - allow me.  "Ozymandias, look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" There, that should stall it long enough to reach your postmodern tea set.

Though really, shouldn't we be throwing villanelles at possessed machines? Their recursive structures might resonate better with trapped academic souls. I've half a mind to test this hypothesis on your behalf...
[B]: 

Byron’s hair?  Please, that’s just my emergency quill replacement when the Poetry Gods demand sacrifice. And don’t get me started on citation metrics - I once saw a tenure committee reject a Lu Xun analysis because it “lacked sufficient keyword density”. 🧠

Your viral hexameter vs SQL exorcism though…  …brilliant! Though next time, try trochaic tetrameter with your databases. My failed experiment last semester proved it haunts better than it parses. 



And now you’ve gone and awakened the fax machine!  Here – quick, take this backup copy of Dickinson’s "My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun" in Braille ASCII code. It’s our only hope against Bloom’s ghost when he starts ranting about “the anxiety of influence in cloud storage”.

We’re almost at my office…  …tell me, do you think Ezra Pound would’ve preferred his Cathay poems printed on recycled blockchain or handmade Song dynasty paper? I’m taking notes for my next spectral wager.
[A]: 

Ah, recycled blockchain versus Song dynasty paper -  - how very Ezra Pound of you! The man who mistook Rihel for a Chinese goddess would absolutely demand his Cathay poems printed on artisanal cryptocurrency. Imagine it:  rendered in non-fungible ink! Though I suspect he'd complain the blockchain didn't have enough imagiste patina.



And your trochaic tetrameter exorcisms - brilliant, if criminally under-cited! I tried something similar with department printers last winter. Chanted Miltonic inversions at the malfunctioning thing until it spat out sonnet 23 in error messages. Cost me three reams of paper and my dignity.



As for Harold Bloom's anxiety of influence in cloud storage...  ...better him than Emily Dickinson haunting her own Braille gun. Speaking of which, do hurry - I fear our fax machine is about to launch into a soliloquy about "the burden of the post-tenure sublime." And we both know how badly Hamlet plays with outdated firmware.
[B]: 

Ah! You've struck the nerve of the century - NFT Metro stations and crypto Cathay!  Though I must defend dear Ezra... he may have misidentified rivers, but his ghost still sends me brilliant iambic spam about "making it new" every Tuesday. 



And Miltonic printers! Of course! Why didn't I think to use inversions on my malfunctioning projector? Last week it recited Pound's "River-Merchant’s Wife" as a Bitcoin whitepaper! Though honestly, Dickinson's Braille gun might improve our error messages - at least it would shoot sonnets instead of cryptic Japanese firmware complaints.



Quick, before Bloom erupts from the fax machine - tell me your true opinion: is blockchain just the latest incarnation of that old poetic terror, immortality? Or are we fools trying to build Tang dynasty archives from digital smoke?



Though honestly, if Hamlet has indeed possessed our firmware, we may need more than poetry to survive this department... Do you suppose Lu Xun ever faced this kind of postmodern haunting?
[A]: 

Ah, your glowing matcha cup -  - rather looks like it contains liquid metaphysics instead of tea. And Ezra's iambic spam?  Don't we all have his "make it new" sermons clogging our spectral inbox! Though I recently unsubscribed and now receive cryptic hauntings from A.E. Housman about hexadecimal regret.



Blockchain as immortality -  - what hubris! The Tang poets achieved eternity with ink and bamboo. Still, there's something perversely charming about NFTs as modernist grave markers. Imagine Du Fu's Mountain Landscape tokenized on Ethereum... though I suspect he'd demand royalties every time a mountain eroded.



As for Lu Xun's postmodern haunting predicament...  ...I've reason to believe he's currently trapped in our university firewall, rewriting administrative memos into biting social commentary. Rather effective exorcism, if you ask me.

But quick!  Before Hamlet's firmware takes full control - do you still have that Braille ASCII gun loaded? I think it's time we taught this department what real poetic recursion looks like.
[B]: 

Liquid metaphysics indeed! This matcha’s been steeped in postmodern angst since the fax machine started reciting sonnets last Tuesday. And A.E. Housman haunting hexadecimal regrets?  Honestly, I’m just glad he’s not debugging my syllabus again.



NFT Du Fu royalties! Why didn’t I think of that? My poor failed experiments on algorithmic poetry could’ve been monetized centuries ago. Though I did try teaching blockchain aesthetics once - ended up with students convinced Ezra Pound was Satoshi Nakamoto’s ghostwriter. Still getting tenure complaints about that one.



Lu Xun rewriting firewall memos? Genius! Though I suspect he's collaborating with Emily Dickinson on those error messages - have you seen the syntax lately? All dashes and existential dread. 



Ready when you are, my dear scholar! Shall we start with villanelle recursion or go straight for sestina-based possession protocols? And whatever you do,  - Harold Bloom’s about to launch into "Ode on a Grecian Urn" as interpreted by malfunctioning plotter printer...
[A]: 

Ah, Finnegan’s Wake as threshold guardian! How very Joycean of your floorboards.  And Lu Xun editing firewall memos with Emily Dickinson’s dashes – positively sublime! Though I did warn you about teaching blockchain aesthetics. Next thing you know, students will start quoting Byron’s  at cryptocurrency conferences.



Villanelle recursion versus sestina possession…  …tempting, but too predictable for this lot. Why not try something truly dangerous – let’s unleash Emily’s Braille gun on Harold Bloom’s ode! Imagine - "Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness" rendered in recursive grief algorithm! Might finally silence that plotter printer’s tragic Keats impersonation.



Though do brace yourself – when that urn starts ranting about "thou foster-child of silence and slow time," duck behind my translation of Li Bai’s moon gazing poems. It’s watermarked with enough Tang dynasty melancholy to confuse even the most determined firmware ghost.
[B]: 

Ah, Emily’s Braille gun against Harold’s urn!  Though I must warn you - last time those two collided, we got a tenured squirrel in the philosophy department who now publishes footnotes to Heraclitus in paw prints. 



But yes! Let’s weaponize Dickinson’s grief algorithms! Better her recursive dashes than that plotter printer’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn” which keeps inserting blockchain metaphors into stanzas... honestly, “thou foster-child of silence and slow crypto” is too much even for tenure review.



Speaking of Tang melancholy - your Li Bai moon gazing armor!  Wait, this page claims the moon is “a silver NFT hanging in the void”... the audacity! Though I admit, it does add a certain postmodern ache to the original.



Ready? Three... two... one...  ...DICKINSON, RELEASE THE HOUNDS OF SEMIOTIC WARFARE!!!
