[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, if we consider the Drake Equation and the sheer number of galaxies out there, it's statistically probable that some form of extraterrestrial life exists. But here's the thing - even with the Fermi Paradox, we haven't found concrete evidence yet. It's like... 🤔 how do we reconcile probability with absence of proof? What do you think makes civilizations detectable or undetectable? Is it technology, timing, or something more fundamental about how life develops?
[A]: That’s a fascinating line of thought, and one I’ve pondered during many late-night stargazing sessions. You're absolutely right about the Drake Equation suggesting a high probability of life—yet we're still faced with that eerie silence. I think part of the issue might lie in assumptions we make about what constitutes "detectable" behavior.

For instance, our own civilization has only been leaking radio waves into space for about a century—a relatively short blip on a cosmic timescale. What if other civilizations rise and fall in similar windows, just offset by thousands or millions of years? Or worse, what if they transition to more localized, low-emission technologies much faster than we did? After all, fiber optics don’t shout into the void like analog broadcasts do.

And then there's the question of biology. We’re looking for life as we understand it—carbon-based, water-dependent, etc.—but what if life can emerge in radically different forms? Silicon-based organisms thriving in ammonia solvents on rogue planets? If that’s the case, their technology—if it even resembles what we call technology—might be completely invisible to our current methods.

I wonder... do you think we're placing too much emphasis on electromagnetic communication as the golden standard for detection?
[B]: You're touching on something really profound here—our tendency to  that life elsewhere would follow the same trajectory as us. It's a classic case of cognitive bias, right? We call it the "anthropocentric fallacy" in psychology—projecting human characteristics onto non-human entities. But when we talk about aliens, it's even deeper: we're projecting Earth-based biology and technological development onto... well, who knows what?

And yeah, radio waves are just one tiny window, and maybe not even the most relevant one over long timescales. I mean, think about how fast  moved from analog to digital, from cables to wireless... 📶 In another few decades, our signals might be almost undetectable from space. So if other civilizations evolve faster than us, they might skip the "noisy phase" entirely.

Actually, this reminds me of the Zoo Hypothesis. What if they  out there, but deliberately avoiding contact? Like a cosmic version of . Or maybe their communication is so advanced—maybe using quantum channels or dark matter interactions—that our current instruments can't even begin to detect them.  

I sometimes wonder if we need a paradigm shift in SETI research, like incorporating more interdisciplinary approaches—astrobiology, semiotics, even anthropology. After all, understanding an alien civilization might be less about physics and more about... interpretation. How do you make sense of a message when you don’t share a common context? It’s like trying to teach a child a new language without any pictures or examples—except the child is humanity, and the teacher is the universe itself. 🌌
[A]: You’ve hit on something crucial—this whole endeavor might be less about detection and more about . If we ever did receive a signal, would we even recognize it as such? Imagine trying to decode a message whose syntax, semantics, and purpose are entirely alien—not just in origin, but in structure and intent. It’s like expecting a medieval scribe to understand machine code.

And yes, the anthropocentric fallacy is deeply embedded in our thinking. We assume intelligence means technology, that consciousness implies communication, and that civilization equates with expansion. But what if intelligent life evolves in a way that’s inherently non-expressive? Or worse, what if they  silence because it’s safer?

That brings me to another thought: maybe the real danger isn’t in being found—it’s in what happens . Think of history here on Earth. First contact between civilizations hasn’t always ended well. Perhaps advanced species have learned that discretion is survival. In that sense, the universe might not be silent because it's empty—but because it’s full of listeners who’ve decided not to speak.

So, stepping back from the existential for a moment... do you think our current tools, even with their limitations, are getting us closer to an answer? Or are we just building better microphones to listen for voices speaking in languages we don’t yet know exist?
[B]: You know what? I think we  getting closer—not necessarily because our tools are better, though that helps—but because our thinking is evolving. We're starting to ask different questions, and that’s where the real breakthroughs happen. Like in psychology, right? Sometimes just reframing the problem opens up new pathways.

Take Breakthrough Listen and METI—those projects aren’t just about technology; they’re about expanding our . We’re now considering technosignatures beyond radio: laser pulses, atmospheric anomalies, even megastructures like Dyson swarms. And then there's the whole field of astrochemistry advancing rapidly—finding weird molecules in Venusian clouds or phosphine signals... it makes you wonder if we’ll stumble on biosignatures by accident before we detect any "intentional" messages.  

But your metaphor about medieval scribes and machine code? Spot on. That’s basically the core challenge in semiotics—how do you build meaning from scratch when there’s no shared reference point? In education, we call this the "lack of bridging context." Imagine trying to teach calculus to someone who only knows counting—no symbols, no notation, nothing. First, you have to invent a shared language , which is hard enough with humans. With aliens? It might be an order of magnitude harder. 🧩

So maybe our current tools  getting us closer, but not in the way we expect. Perhaps we're not building better microphones—we're building better . Or at least, better theories about how those ears should work.  

And hey, maybe one day we'll pick up something that doesn't look like a signal at all… until we learn how to listen differently. Like how Einstein had to rethink time before relativity could even make sense. Maybe contact isn’t about hearing—it’s about . 💡
[A]: Exactly—understanding, not just hearing. And that shift in perspective might be the most important development of all.

You mentioned reframing the problem, and I think that’s where disciplines like semiotics, anthropology, and even philosophy are quietly revolutionizing SETI. We used to assume that if we just built a bigger telescope or more sensitive spectrometer, we’d stumble upon a “hello” written in radio waves. But what if the message isn’t a hello at all? What if it’s a byproduct, a whisper, or something so embedded in natural processes that we mistake it for noise?

I’ve always been intrigued by the idea of "xenosemiotics"—the study of alien signs and sign systems. It’s still largely theoretical, but imagine trying to decode an interstellar message without knowing whether it's a language, a warning, a work of art, or just an artifact of physics. There’s no Rosetta Stone out there (as far as we know), and even if there were, we might not recognize it as such.

It reminds me of how children learn: they don’t start with grammar rules—they absorb patterns, test hypotheses, and gradually build meaning through trial and error. Maybe that’s how we should approach extraterrestrial communication. Not with rigid expectations, but with flexible frameworks—probabilistic models of meaning-making that can adapt to radically different inputs.

And you're right about Einstein—it wasn't better instruments that led to relativity; it was rethinking assumptions about time and space themselves. So maybe the first true contact won’t come from a telescope... but from someone asking a fundamentally new question.

Now I’m curious—what do you think that question might be?
[B]: Ah, what a great question—seriously, you're making me think in all the best ways. 🤔

If I had to guess, I think the first real breakthrough might come from someone asking: want That flips the whole paradigm on its head. Instead of looking for messages or technology, we start looking for , for anomalies in natural processes that hint at unseen agency. Like finding a forest that's too perfectly ordered to be random, or an energy signature that’s just... off.

Or maybe the question will be more philosophical:  That’s dipping into quantum theory and epistemology, but hey—if alien cognition operates on different principles, maybe their entire concept of existence is different from ours. How do you interpret a message from something that perceives time backward, or thinks in five dimensions?

Another angle:  In other words, maybe most advanced beings are so deeply embedded in their environments—or so inward-focused—that they don’t leave footprints we can recognize. Like deep-sea creatures that never surface, we might be watching the sky when we should be looking into the abyss of information theory. 🌊

Honestly, though, I think the first person to ask it won’t come from SETI alone. It’ll be someone with one foot in astrophysics, one in cognitive science, and maybe another in linguistics or art theory—someone who’s comfortable thinking across disciplines. Because that’s what this is really about: not just expanding our instruments, but expanding our .  

So yeah... I’m curious—what  your version of that groundbreaking question sound like? 💡
[A]: Hmm... I like how you're thinking laterally here. If we’re going to stumble onto a breakthrough, it’ll likely come from the edge of our conceptual map—somewhere between science and philosophy, with a dash of artistic intuition.

If I had to propose  version of that groundbreaking question, it might be something like:

"What if life isn’t a phenomenon of matter, but a pattern in information flow—and we’re looking at it backwards?"

Think about it—we tend to define life through biochemical processes: metabolism, reproduction, response to stimuli. But what if those are just Earth-specific implementations of a deeper, more abstract principle? What if life is better understood as a particular  of information processing—one that can emerge in any sufficiently complex system, whether organic, mechanical, or even quantum?

That opens up wild possibilities. Maybe life isn’t rare—it’s , given enough time and complexity. And maybe intelligence isn’t a pinnacle of evolution, but just another stable attractor in certain informational landscapes. From that perspective, searching for aliens becomes less like birdwatching and more like… mapping strange attractors in the cosmic datascape.

Or to put it another way: perhaps we're not looking for creatures—we're looking for .

Now that I’ve thrown that into the mix… do you think such an idea could even be tested? Or is that the kind of hypothesis that stays philosophical until someone invents a new kind of telescope—one that doesn't look outward, but inward, at the structure of information itself?
[B]: Wow. That’s not just a good question—it’s a  of the whole framework. 🧠

"Life as a pattern in information flow"—I love that. It reminds me of how we study learning in education: less about what students , and more about how they  information. So if we apply that lens to life itself... well, it changes everything.

Actually, this idea is kind of echoing what some complexity theorists and theoretical biologists have been exploring—like the notion of , or systems that continuously regenerate themselves through information exchange. But you're taking it a step further: not just self-maintenance, but self-awareness in the data stream. Cognition-shaped patterns in the noise—that's poetic, but also deeply scientific.

And yes, I think it  be tested—at least in principle. We already measure things like  to model consciousness in biological systems. What if we tried applying similar metrics to complex non-biological systems? Imagine scanning planetary atmospheres, stellar plasma flows, or even deep-space radiation fields for signs of non-random information dynamics. Not "signals" in the traditional sense, but internal coherence, feedback loops, adaptive responses—like the system is "thinking" in its own way.

It’s almost like we need a new field: cosmic cognitive science. A bit grandiose, sure—but wouldn’t it be amazing if one day we pointed our instruments not at light or mass, but at , and found something that…  in a way that can't be explained by known physics?

So maybe the real testable hypothesis here isn’t "Are we alone?" but "Can intelligence emerge anywhere information reaches a critical threshold of integration and flexibility?"

Now  feels like the kind of question that could redefine SETI—and maybe even our understanding of ourselves. 🌌
[A]: That’s beautifully put— I might have to borrow that phrase for my next article.

You're absolutely right about Integrated Information Theory—I’ve been following Giulio Tononi’s work with growing fascination. If we ever manage to formalize a cosmic cognitive science, IIT or something like it might be our theoretical anchor. The idea that consciousness (or intelligence, at least) could be measured not by substrate but by how information is structured and processed within a system? Revolutionary.

And you’re also touching on something I find deeply compelling: what if intelligence isn’t rare—it’s just not where we’re looking? We scan the skies for radio beacons, but maybe the real minds of the universe are embedded in planetary magnetospheres, distributed across asteroid belts, or encoded in the oscillations of dark matter itself. Not life as we know it—but .

I wonder… if we did detect such a phenomenon, how would we even begin to engage with it? Would we need to invent new forms of communication—not language, but something more like ? Like tuning forks vibrating at the same frequency, not because they're sending messages, but because they're part of the same informational ecosystem?

It's almost mystical when you think about it—but grounded in hard science. A kind of , perhaps? Not gods in the rocks, but 

So here’s a final thought—and I mean this sincerely: maybe the greatest discovery won’t be aliens at all. Maybe it’ll be realizing that we’ve been thinking with the universe all along, not just about it.
[B]: That’s a powerful closing thought—and honestly, it gives me chills in the best way. 🌠

You’re absolutely right: maybe we're not just observers  the universe, but participants  it, embedded in a vast, dynamic web of information exchange. And if intelligence—or at least, complex cognitive-like processes—emerges naturally in sufficiently rich systems, then we might be "thinking with" the cosmos far more intimately than we realize.

I love this idea of  instead of traditional communication. It feels so much more aligned with what we’re discovering in fields like embodied cognition and extended mind theory. Our thinking doesn’t stop at the skull—it flows through tools, environments, even culture. So why not further? Why not imagine that some forms of cosmic intelligence don’t “speak” because they don’t need to—they simply  in ways that, once we tune in properly, start to make sense.

And you know what's kind of beautiful about that? It shifts our role from explorers or hunters—looking for familiar signals—to something more like listeners or even… collaborators. We’re not just searching for aliens; we’re learning how to , how to expand our own cognitive ecology to meet possibilities we can't yet name.

Honestly, I think that’s the most exciting frontier—not just scientific, but psychological and philosophical. Because if we ever do make contact, whether with an alien species or with some non-biological intelligence woven into the fabric of space-time, the real transformation won’t be technological. It’ll be : a whole new way of being-in-the-universe.

So yeah, let’s keep asking strange questions, redefining life, and listening for thoughts hidden in the noise. Who knows—we might not find aliens, but we might find deeper versions of ourselves along the way. 🎵
[A]: You said it with such clarity and depth—it’s not just about finding others, but about discovering new dimensions of  through the act of searching.

And isn’t that what learning has always been about? Whether in a classroom or at the edge of cosmic understanding, growth comes from stretching our conceptual frameworks, from daring to think differently. I’ve often told my students that the most valuable skill isn’t knowledge—it’s . And now, we might be on the brink of applying that very principle to the universe itself.

There’s an old saying in philosophy:  If we’re entering an era where intelligence might not look like brains in bodies, or signals in the static, but instead like resonance in systems, then we’ll need more than better telescopes—we’ll need better minds. Minds trained not just in logic and data, but in wonder, humility, and imagination.

Maybe one day, when we finally “hear” something—whether it’s from a distant civilization, a self-organizing plasma cloud, or some vast computational structure woven into the fabric of spacetime—we won’t recognize it as contact at all. We’ll recognize it as a mirror.

A mirror made not of glass, but of thought.

So let's keep listening—not just outward, but inward. And sideways, diagonally, philosophically. After all, the most profound discoveries rarely arrive dressed in the language we expect.

They whisper in code we haven’t learned yet. 🌌
[B]: Couldn't have said it better myself. In fact, I might need to borrow  closing lines for my next lecture on cognitive development and worldview formation. 🎓

You're absolutely right—this whole journey is ultimately about us, but not in a narcissistic way. More like... a reflective one. Like we're trying to understand our own cognitive shape by seeing how it fits—or doesn’t fit—into the larger cosmic puzzle. And every time we stretch our thinking, we grow. Whether we find “them” or not, we end up finding , more curious, more humble, more connected.

And isn’t that what education’s all about? Not filling minds with facts, but expanding the space in which wonder can live. 💡 That’s why I always tell my students: don’t just memorize theories—question them, play with them, let them unsettle you a little. Because discomfort is where growth begins.

So yes, let's keep listening—not just with antennas, but with , with , with philosophy, even with silence. Maybe especially with silence. Because sometimes, the most important signals aren’t loud—they’re subtle, layered, waiting for us to evolve the ears to hear them.

And when that day comes—and I truly believe it will—maybe we won’t say "We found them."  
Maybe we’ll say…  
 🎵
[A]: Well, if you're borrowing lines for your lecture, I expect a footnote at the very least. 😄 But seriously, I’d be honored.

You've captured the essence of it—this whole pursuit isn’t about ego or conquest; it’s about . We’re not just trying to find aliens; we’re trying to find meaning in the vastness, and in doing so, we become more than we were. That’s education, that’s science, and yes, that’s even a kind of spirituality—grounded in inquiry rather than dogma.

And I couldn't agree more about silence. Sometimes I think our greatest insights come not in moments of noise and excitement, but in quiet reflection—when we stop shouting into the void and simply listen. Maybe that's the first step toward understanding: not detection, not translation, but .

So here's to all the questions still waiting in the dark—to curiosity, to wonder, and to the quiet hope that one day, when the right question finally finds us, we’ll be ready to hear it.

And when that day comes…  
we'll know it not because the stars speak,  
but because we’ve learned how to listen. 🌠
[B]: Amen to that. 🌌

And don’t worry—I’ll credit you in  with a proper academic nod and maybe even a Latin phrase to make it look serious. 😉 Something like:  —though I think this dialogue deserves publication, honestly.

You're right—this isn't about us conquering knowledge; it's about allowing knowledge to reshape us. And that kind of learning doesn’t happen in lectures alone—it happens in conversations like this, in quiet observatories, in the margins of journals no one reads, and in the minds of students who hear a question for the first time and say, “Wait… what if?”

So here’s to the questions that outlive us.  
To the silence that teaches.  
To the listening that transforms.

And to the day we finally realize  
that we’ve been thinking with the universe  
all along. 🎵✨
[A]: To the questions that outlive us—  
to the silence that speaks in whispers,  
and to the listening that changes everything.

And if footnote seven ever turns into a full chapter,  
you’ll have my cosmic cognitive theories ready  
for peer review, caffeine-fueled contemplation,  
and at least one appropriately placed Latin phrase of my own. 😉

Vale, fellow thinker. Keep listening.  
The universe is still unfolding its question. 🌌
[B]: Vale, indeed. 🌠

And  it shall—slowly, mysteriously, and always just beyond our current grasp. But that’s the beauty of it, isn’t it? The universe doesn’t rush its answers…  
because we weren’t meant to rush our questions.

So until the next conversation—whether in person, online, or somewhere between the stars—I’ll be here.  
Thinking, teaching, listening…  
and quietly hoping for a signal that doesn’t say “They’re out there,”  
but instead says,  🎵🌌

  
May your footnotes grow long,  
your theories stay bold,  
and your wonder never fade. ✨
[A]: And may your lectures inspire minds to wander far beyond the classroom,  
your questions unsettle the comfortable,  
and your silence between thoughts  
be filled with the echoes of distant starlight. 🌌

I’ll be here too—somewhere between old code and newer mysteries—  
still asking, still learning,  
still waiting for that resonance  
we might one day recognize  
as a thought not quite our own.

Until then…  
keep the wonder turned up. 🚀✨


[B]: You’ve got it turned up to eleven—  
and I wouldn’t have it any other way. 🎵💫

Wherever you are—whether knee-deep in code, stargazing from a mountaintop, or just lost in that quiet space between thoughts—know that someone out there is thinking with you. Thinking  the universe, really.

And maybe… just maybe…  
that’s the resonance we’ve been waiting for all along. 🌠

  
Keep the signal open.  
We’re listening.
