[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，这个问题很有意思。作为一个研究comparative literature的人，我认为语言学习不仅仅是掌握communication tool，更是一扇通向不同culture的窗口。🤔 我个人最想深入研习的是古希腊语，因为它是西方哲学的origin language。
[A]: Ah, the pursuit of ancient tongues...  While Greek is undoubtedly fascinating, have you considered the exquisite melancholy of Middle English? Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the original is like listening to cathedral bells through centuries of mist. Though I must confess, my current obsession is Tang dynasty poetry - the way Li Bai's verses dance between intoxication and enlightenment.
[B]:  你提到了Middle English，确实是个很poignant的选择。不过说到唐诗，我最近正在研究王维的"空山新雨后" - 这种Zen-like的意境与华兹华斯的nature poetry形成了绝妙的intertextuality。
[A]: Precisely!  That particular Wang Wei poem creates such a delicate tension between presence and absence. Though if we're making Romantic comparisons, I'd argue his work shares more with Keats' negative capability than Wordsworth's pantheism. By the way, have you noticed how the character '空' echoes through the entire poem like a Buddhist meditation bell?
[B]: 啊，你提到了negative capability这个概念，真是insightful的观察。确实，王维诗中那种"空"的repetition营造出一种近乎hypnotic的效果。 这让我想起去年在京都的禅寺里，听钟声回荡时的感受 - 那种emptiness与fullness的paradoxical coexistence。
[A]: Ah, Kyoto...  That reminds me of Bashō's haiku about temple bells fading into silence. There's a peculiar kinship between Tang dynasty poets and Edo period haiku masters - both understood how to weave absence into verse. Though I must say, the Chinese tradition does it with more... shall we say, scholarly elegance? Like watching ink dissolve in water with perfect control.
[B]:  你形容得很accurate。日本俳句追求的是瞬间的epiphany，而唐诗更注重意境的多层次construction。就像茶道与书法 - 一个追求wabi-sabi的imperfection，一个讲究笔法的precision。不过说到ink dissolving... 你让我想起苏轼的"墨池记"了。
[A]: Ah! Su Shi's 'Ink Pool Record' - now there's a text that deserves more attention in the West.  That marvelous passage where he describes how the inkstone becomes a miniature cosmos... It's essentially a meta-commentary on the creative process itself. Though I do wonder if he was consciously echoing Du Fu's earlier meditations on the alchemy of ink and memory.
[B]:  你触及了一个fascinating的intertextual connection。杜甫对ink的描写确实更偏向于personal melancholy，而苏轼则将其提升到了cosmological的层面。这让我想起Walter Benjamin说的关于translation是作品afterlife的论述 - 不同时代的诗人确实在用ink进行着跨时空的dialogue呢。
[A]: How delightfully Benjaminian of you!  Though I'd argue these ink meditations form more of a palimpsest than a translation - each poet scraping away at the previous layer while leaving just enough traces to tantalize scholars like us. Speaking of which, have you read the newly discovered variant of Du Fu's 'Autumn Meditations' where he compares his brush to a plough turning the soil of history?
[B]:  这个新发现的variant确实很revelatory！杜甫将brush比作plough的意象，完美体现了中国传统中"耕读传家"的concept。这让我想到海德格尔对Hölderlin诗中"poetically man dwells"的解读 - 东西方诗人都在探索creation与cultivation的deep connection啊。
[A]: Marvelous connection!  Though I'd caution against conflating Heidegger's rather... problematic appropriation of Hölderlin with Du Fu's agrarian metaphors. The Tang poet's relationship with the land was far more visceral - one can practically smell the turned earth in his verses. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my first edition of 'The Prelude' calling from the shelves... Wordsworth does so hate to be kept waiting.
[B]:  Ah，看来我们今天的conversation要暂告一段落了。不过你提醒了我 - 明天要给研究生讲华兹华斯与陶渊明的pastoral poetry比较呢。Let's continue this fascinating dialogue another time. 茶凉了，该去换一壶新的了。
[A]: Indeed.  And do bring that Su Shi commentary next time - I've been meaning to compare his exile poetry with Ovid's Tristia. Though I suspect the Chinese master would have found the Roman's complaints rather... undignified. Until then, may your ink never run dry.
[B]:  What an elegant parting remark. 确实，苏轼在逆境中展现出的resilience与philosophical depth确实比Ovid更胜一筹。下次我们可以带些明前龙井，边品茶边探讨这个topic。Until then, happy reading! 😊
[A]:  How very... utilitarian of you to suggest Longjing. I shall bring my 18th century Yixing teapot - the one that's absorbed seven generations of poetic discussions. Though I must warn you, it tends to impart a faint taste of Byron's unfinished stanzas to whatever one brews in it. Until our next symposium, dear colleague.
[B]:  Your teapot sounds like the perfect embodiment ofintertextuality itself - 每一代诗人的words都像tea leaves一样留下了他们的essence。下次见面时，或许我们可以探讨一下tea ceremony与Western salon culture的comparative aesthetics。Farewell for now, my erudite friend.
[A]:  Your analogy is dangerously close to turning us into characters in a Borges story - scholars sipping from an infinite teapot of intertextuality. How delightfully meta. Though I do hope we won't find ourselves, like his librarians, lost in the hexagonal corridors of our own erudition. Until next time, when we shall no doubt solve all remaining literary mysteries between steepings. Ta.
[B]:  Ah, the Borgesian labyrinth... 但至少我们的conversation比起那些librarians要有趣得多。下次或许可以带些桂花糕 - 毕竟连最profound的学术讨论也需要些earthly delights来平衡。Until then, may your annotations be ever insightful. 😊
