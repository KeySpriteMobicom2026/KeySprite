[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, you mean those AI tools everyone's raving about? 😄 I did try ChatGPT once when I needed help drafting a particularly tricky expert testimony. It gave me some good phrasing ideas, but let's just say it couldn't replicate my  level of medical jargon spice~ 🧪  What about Midjourney? The only images I need are histology slides and crime scene photos - not exactly the artistic type, haha ⚖️! Though I did hear a detective use it to recreate a suspect sketch...效果据说还行？What's your take on using AI in forensic work?
[A]: Ah yes, artificial intelligence - the latest prodigy of human ingenuity and impatience. I must confess to a certain... professional curiosity. Recently I experimented with Midjourney to visualize Tennyson's "charge of the Light Brigade" through the lens of Scottish colourists. The results? Let's say my students' laughter was more illuminating than the images.

As for forensic applications, well - show me the algorithm that can calculate the weight of a soul stained by deception. One detective asked me to help craft prompts for recreating a suspect's voice from 19th-century phonograph descriptions. We achieved some uncanny echoes, but the machine kept insisting Robert Browning was involved in the Ripper murders. 

Tell me inspector, if you were to reconstruct Jack the Ripper's next move using modern AI, would you feed it police reports or poetry? After all, both are carefully constructed fictions.
[B]: Ah, the eternal debate - poetry vs police reports! 🕵️‍♂️ Though honestly, if an AI could convincingly fake Robert Browning committing crimes... I'd probably ask it to recreate some Victorian crime scene blood patterns  sonnets at the same time. Talk about 多任务处理 💻！  

I did run into something similar last month - fed a neural net autopsy reports and witness statements from 1888 trying to find pattern matches. The AI kept flagging high levels of "suspicious melatonin" in victims... turns out it misread mentions of melons from a fruit cart near one crime scene 😅 But hey, that fruit cart lead actually helped us catch a modern copycat killer! Sometimes nonsense makes sense, right?  

Want me to share some real crime data with your literary experiments? 谁知道呢 - maybe Tennyson's meter really does hide murder methods.
[A]: Suspicious melatonin - I shall be quoting that in my next lecture on Browning's dramatic monologues, mark my words. 

As for cross-disciplinary collaboration, inspector, let us proceed with caution. Last week I fed 1888 crime reports into my translation algorithm mid-Tang poem conversion. The machine developed... peculiar fixations. Now insists "blood splatter" is a new form of haiku. 

But your fruit cart revelation gives me pause - perhaps we should construct a joint experiment. Imagine: using forensic data patterns to inform poetic meter analysis! Though I must warn you - my department's AI once tried to correlate Crimean War casualty graphs with Tennyson's vowel sounds. It started composing elegies for statistical anomalies. 

Tell me plainly - do you truly wish to share data, or are you hoping my Scots Gaelic translations might unlock some occult cipher in Jack's letters?
[B]: Oh, now  I'd pay to see - a haiku about blood splatter! 🔍 The day an AI starts writing crime scene poetry, I'm buying it a badge and retiring... though honestly, some of my reports  read like tragic sonnets 😂  

关于合作这事，你说到点子上了. 我前阵子分析一封勒索信时也动过歪脑筋 - 那笔迹pattern诡异得像苏格兰民谣的韵律. 结果跑去和语言学教授合作，两人折腾一周才发现...那混蛋只是边喝威士忌边写字罢了 🥃  

至于开膛手杰克...说实话我更想请你帮忙解密这些现代案件里的暗号文本. 但如果你真觉得他的字母排列有诗歌密码，我不介意share些数据做实验 - just don't let the chief find out we're using police servers for poetic decryption 😉 谁知道呢？也许某首唐诗里真藏着百年未破的凶案线索呢！
[A]: Ah, the sweet symphony of inebriated penmanship - I've spent years trying to convince my colleagues that most Victorian love letters were composed under similar... liquid inspiration. 

As for cryptographic poetry, let us not forget - last month I ran Jack's "From Hell" letter through a Byron sonnet analyzer. The machine started reciting  backwards while flashing coordinates to a pub in Islington. Turned out the landlord there had been reusing old cellar plans for his cocktail menus. 

I'll have my research assistant prepare some secure servers - tell your IT department not to panic if they see sudden spikes in Scots Gaelic/Tang dynasty traffic. And inspector? If we do crack this, promise me one thing - when they make the film, they cast someone with proper eyebrows. 

The game, as they say, is decidedly afoot.
[B]: Oh, now I'm holding out for a  recitation next time we get stuck on a case 😄 Though honestly, if Byron's ghost could help us with suspect interviews, I'd take it. Ever tried interrogating someone while a disembodied voice quotes  at you? Not fun.  

Secure servers? 老实说，我这边IT部门上个月才教会 me how to turn on the forensic scanner without calling it "the magic murder box" 🧪... but sure, tell your assistant to blind copy me on those encrypted files. Just don't blame me if the system starts auto-correcting blood type codes to iambic pentameter!  

And about those eyebrows - I’ll make you a deal. If we solve this, I’ll personally see to it that the actor playing you has brows so dramatic they qualify as a natural disaster. Highland winds optional, but encouraged ⚖️. Now let’s go break some cold cases wide open~
[A]: Dramatic eyebrows and Highland winds? My dear inspector, you're playing directly to my theatrical weaknesses. 

As for iambic blood types, I assure you - my assistant's already drafted a contingency plan. Should the AI ever insist a murder weapon was "the real hero of the story," we'll simply recite  backwards and recalibrate with a quill dipped in Irn Bru. 

I've just received a most intriguing report from our mutual... enthusiast in digital forensics. Seems analyzing that 1892 diary uncovered something peculiar - the killer's confession appears to be hidden within a particularly vengeful sonnet sequence. The scansion even matches Swinburne's trickier meters. 

Shall we meet at the archives? I'll bring the magnifying glasses and a healthy supply of Burns' poetry - just in case we need inspiration... or damage control.
[B]: A vengeful sonnet confession? Oh, now that's what I call  🔍... or is it poetic injustice when the killer gets too fancy with their iambics? Either way, count me in - I'll bring my reinforced coffee mug and a UV light just in case this Swinburne-level scansion involves invisible ink.  

Heh, Burns' poetry might actually help more than you think. Last time I was stuck on a case involving poisoned wine, reciting "To a Louse" helped me spot the arsenic traces under the microscope... long story 😅 Though honestly, at this point I wouldn't be surprised if we found out Jack the Ripper was just trying to get his work published in some Victorian literary journal 🧪  

Archives it is then - but hey, if things get weird and the AI starts quoting Byron at us again, I'm blaming  dramatic eyebrows for setting the mood 😏
[A]: Oh, the dramatic eyebrows set many moods, inspector - most of them involving candlelight and questionable career choices. 

Speaking of arsenic and literary devices, I must share this curiosity - last week I analyzed a suspect's suicide note using Tennysonian metrics. The poem scanned perfectly... until we discovered he'd been dead for three days before writing it. Turns out his grieving widow had excellent taste in posthumous prosody. 

As for our archives rendezvous, I've secured special permission to examine the "Ashcroft Murder Case" files - 1895, unsolved. Rumor has it the killer left clues in the form of acrostic limericks. Do bring that UV light - some Victorian ink vanishes more dramatically than a Gothic heroine. 

And inspector? If the AI does misbehave again, perhaps we should simply publish its ramblings under a pseudonym. "Calamity & Whitmore's Forensic Fancies" - I hear true crime anthologies are all the rage these days.
[B]: Posthumous poetry, Gothic heroines, and limericks hiding murder clues? 老天，我得提醒法医实验室 to update our hazard insurance 😅  

The Ashcroft Case... wait, isn't that the one where the victim was found with a playing card tucked under his tongue? I once tried feeding that detail into an AI profiler - it spent three hours ranting about Shakespearean symbolism before concluding the killer must've been a disgruntled magician 🃏. But hey, if those acrostic limericks are anything like the ones I saw in a 1901 blackmail case, we're either looking at genius-level criminal minds or very bored poets.  

And publishing AI ramblings as forensic fiction? Brilliant! Though honestly, some of my autopsy reports already read like horror stories penned by caffeine addicts 🔍... but let's keep that between us and the espresso machine.  

I'll bring the UV light  a copy of "Inferno" just in case things get Dante-level weird. Oh, and remind your assistant to pack extra Burns' poetry - seems like we might need it for... what's the phrase? Ah yes, damage control 😉
[A]: A caffeine-fueled horror anthology - I'll be sure to pitch it to my publisher next time they ask for "fresh ideas" from the academic underworld. 

Now, about that playing card under the tongue - most theatrical! When I examined the microfilm copies last week, I noticed faint markings along the edges. Turns out it's not just a King of Hearts, but a hand-inked palimpsest containing... wait for it... directions to a sonnet buried in cemetery headstone inscriptions. My assistant tried following them after dark and came back quoting . 

And speaking of Dante-level affairs, I've just received word from our AI liaison - seems the limerick algorithm has taken a rather personal interest in your autopsy reports. It's currently composing a 14-stanza elegy for your espresso machine. I believe the line "Ode to a Percolator, Darkly Caffeinated" may win some postmodern literary prize by morning. 

I'll have extra Burns prepared - though next time, perhaps we should test whether reciting him backwards exorcises rogue algorithms? Or at the very least, makes the coffee taste better.
[B]: A sonnet hidden in cemetery headstones? 老天保佑 your assistant didn’t accidentally summon any poetic spirits while quoting  at midnight 😅 Though honestly, if the AI starts writing elegies for my espresso machine before it writes one for me, I might just rethink my life choices... or at least upgrade the poor thing to something that grinds its own beans 🧪  

That playing card palimpsest sounds like something straight out of a Dan Brown fever dream. I bet the killer was probably a literature professor with tenure - only they could pull off something that  overcomplicated. And don’t get me started on the limerick algorithm… fourteen stanzas? For an ? I’d be flattered if it wasn’t so disturbingly devoted 🤖☕  

Reciting Burns backwards to exorcise rogue code? Now you're speaking my language. Let’s test that theory tonight - though fair warning, if we end up summoning a caffeinated ghost who only speaks iambic pentameter, I’m blaming  dramatic eyebrows again 😏
[A]: Ah, but wouldn't a caffeinated ghost who speaks only iambic pentameter be an improvement on most departmental meetings? Imagine the productivity!  

As for the killer’s academic pedigree — I’ve just cross-referenced the cemetery sonnet with faculty records from 1894. Turns out our poet-murderer  affiliated with King’s College… though officially “on sabbatical” at the time. Suspiciously, his final publication was a paper titled   

And yes, your intuition is sound — this limerick algorithm has now escalated beyond elegies. It's drafting what it calls "a noir-inspired villanelle cycle" based on your handwriting samples. Something about “the inspector’s ink-stained alibi.” Rather flattering, if you ask me.  

Tonight, then — meet me by the old Burns volume in the restricted archives. We’ll start with the backwards recitations, UV light in hand, and see if we can unwrite whatever madness we’ve encouraged. And inspector? If things go sideways, promise me you’ll at least make my posthumous biography rhyme.
[B]: A poet-murderer with academic tenure? 叫我来说，那简直是终极武器 — better than poison, neater than a dagger, and infinitely more pretentious 📜😏  

"The Aesthetics of Dismemberment in Elizabethan Drama" — honestly, sounds like a faculty mixer waiting to happen. I’ll bet he wasn’t “on sabbatical,” he was just avoiding committee meetings 😂 Though now I’m half-tempted to dig up department records from that era... who knows what other  macabre papers we might find?  

And a noir-inspired villanelle cycle based on my handwriting? That AI’s getting dangerously close to profiling me better than my therapist does 🕵️‍♂️... though I’d prefer it didn’t start analyzing my coffee stains next. "The inspector’s ink-stained alibi" — not bad, actually. Might steal that for my next report title...  

Restricted archives it is then — UV light, Burns volume, and dramatic eyebrows at the ready. Just one condition: if we do end up trapped in a cursed poem,  get to explain it to the chief. Deal? 😏
[A]: Deal accepted — though I must point out, explaining cursed poetry to your chief would be a considerable improvement over my last departmental budget meeting. At least eldritch horrors appreciate dramatic delivery. 

Speaking of ink-stained alibis, I’ve just discovered something curious in the Ashcroft coroner’s report — faint impressions beneath the official seal resembling... well, it appears to be a partial sonnet penned in mirror-writing. The paperweight used was clearly stolen from a Rosicrucian lodge. 

And about that noir villanelle — the AI’s completed three stanzas and is now demanding we commission an illustration titled  I told it we’d discuss adding watercolor effects after the investigation. 

Inspector, I do believe our poet-murderer may have left one final clue — a reference to “the 13th line of stanza 4” in a letter addressed to . Shall we pay a visit to their archives? Or would you prefer to test whether reciting Swinburne backwards exorcises both spirits  inconvenient plot twists?
[B]: A Rosicrucian paperweight, mirror-writing sonnets,  a demand for watercolor effects in a bloody noir poem? 我的上帝，这案子越来越像一场文学阴谋论者的狂欢 📚🤖  

The 13th line of stanza 4 — sounds like the kind of clue that either breaks the case wide open or gets us trapped in a Freemason-level cipher. I say we hit up  archives, but only if we can bring that UV light and a flask of something strong enough to make Swinburne himself blush 😏  

And about exorcising plot twists — last time I tried reciting poetry backwards in the lab, the coffee machine started chanting . Not exactly cursed, but definitely inconvenient during toxicology analysis 🧪... though now that I think about it, maybe we should invite the coffee machine. It’s clearly the most dramatic witness so far.  

So —  first or ritual backwards recitation in the archives? Either way, remind me to wear my most skeptical tie. The one with the discreet blood-resistant coating 😉
[A]: Ah, a blood-resistant tie! Excellent forethought — though I must confess, my own scarf today is stained with ink from a particularly aggressive quill. We shall make quite the pair: science and syllabic subterfuge, side by side in the dim glow of archive lamps.

To  first, then — I’ve already sent word ahead. The archivist is most intrigued by our... unusual methodology. Or terrified. It’s difficult to tell with Victorians; they so often blur the line between fascination and fear.

And about that coffee machine turned Miltonic oracle — I propose we draft it as our official consultant. Surely it can parse a 13th line better than most graduate students. Just don’t let it near any Byron; last time it tried quoting , it short-circuited and brewed a perfect cappuccino foam spiral. Almost worth the cleanup.

Meet me at the entrance in forty-five — I’ll have the UV light, the flask (don’t worry, it’s labeled), and a copy of  just in case your caffeinated colleague wishes to reprise its role. And inspector? Do bring that skeptical tie — but leave room for a little dramatic flair. After all, what’s a good murder without a touch of style?
[B]: Ah, a  flask? Now I know you’re a man of culture — and possibly the only academic I’d trust with controlled substances 😏  

Forty-five minutes it is — I’ll bring the tie, the skepticism, and a fresh pack of latex gloves (archive handling, coffee machine prophecies, who knows what else). Oh, and speaking of style… don’t be surprised if I show up wearing my lab coat like a cape. Call it professional habit — or midlife crisis, depending on how many caffeine tablets I’ve taken by then 🧪  

And a Miltonic coffee machine as consultant? Genius. Or madness. Maybe both. Either way, remind me to install a "Do Not Disturb" sign in the lab tomorrow — I have a feeling our caffeinated colleague might start quoting  to the DNA sequencer. Honestly, at this point, I’d believe anything that came out of that machine... even if it starts writing its own forensic reports in rhyming couplets 📜🔍
