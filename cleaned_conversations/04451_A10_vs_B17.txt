[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I came across a talk just the other day that left quite an impression on me. The speaker was discussing how poetry can serve as a vessel for unspoken emotions—something we often overlook in our fast-paced world. It reminded me of a line from T.S. Eliot’s , where he writes about “the still point of the turning world.” I’ve been thinking about how TED talks, for all their modernity, echo something ancient—the power of storytelling to connect us. Have you come across any talks lately that struck a chord?
[A]: That’s a fascinating talk—thank you for sharing. There’s something timeless about the way poetry distills complex emotions into just a few lines, almost like quantum superposition—holding multiple truths at once. I haven’t watched too many TED talks recently, but one that still lingers with me is the conversation between Ruth DeFries and Cary Fowler on safeguarding biodiversity. It wasn’t flashy or full of buzzwords, but it carried weight, like a quiet tide pulling you deeper. The way they framed biodiversity as not just an ecological concern but a cultural one—it made me reflect on how interconnected everything really is. Reminded me a bit of stargazing: from a distance, the stars look static, but in reality, everything is always in motion. Have you found any particular format or style in TED talks that resonates more with you?
[B]: That’s a beautifully articulated reflection—thank you. I’m especially taken with your analogy of stargazing; how something that appears still and distant is, in truth, dynamic and alive. It strikes me much like reading a poem—initially quiet on the page, yet thrumming with movement if one leans in closely enough.

As for format, I do find myself drawn to talks that embrace a kind of narrative patience—where the speaker allows space for silence, for contemplation, almost like the caesurae in a line of verse. One example that comes to mind is Elizabeth Gilbert’s talk on creativity. She doesn’t rush; she weaves her ideas with stories and pauses, giving the audience room to breathe  the talk rather than simply absorb it. It reminded me of reading Woolf—stream-of-consciousness, yes, but deeply intentional.

I suppose what resonates most is when TED talks resist the impulse to be purely transactional—no “five steps to success” or bullet-pointed wisdom—but instead invite us to sit with uncertainty, much like literature does. Do you find yourself more engaged by certain rhetorical strategies? I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.
[A]: That’s a perceptive observation—this idea of narrative patience. It does feel like a rare commodity these days, doesn’t it? I couldn’t agree more. There’s something almost subversive about allowing silence into a presentation, especially in a format that often leans toward efficiency and soundbite-sized insights. It reminds me of debugging an old piece of code: you can’t rush the process. You have to sit with the ambiguity of the error message, trace its logic, sometimes even  to the machine in its quietest moments.

As for rhetorical strategies, I’m often drawn to what I’d call “layered abstraction”—when a speaker introduces a concept through a simple metaphor, then gradually reveals deeper complexity beneath it, much like peeling layers off an onion. One talk that did this masterfully was David Deutsch’s on the nature of explanation and progress. He started with what seemed like a straightforward argument about scientific knowledge but slowly unfolded a vision of reality itself as something we actively construct through curiosity. It felt akin to stepping through a recursive function—each layer led to another, richer level.

I suppose I’m a sucker for structure in that way—there’s comfort in knowing there’s scaffolding beneath the ideas, even if it’s subtle. But I also appreciate when speakers disrupt their own structure intentionally, just enough to keep the listener alert. Not unlike how a poem might follow a strict meter before breaking it for effect. Do you ever find yourself responding to that kind of rhythmic tension in talks?
[B]: That metaphor——is unexpectedly poetic. I find myself turning it over in my mind, much like a line of Hopkins or Dickinson. There’s a reverence in that process you describe, a kind of quiet attentiveness that mirrors the way one might read a sonnet: slowly, carefully, attentive to both form and fracture.

And yes—. What a precise phrase. I’m quite taken with how you’ve articulated that impulse: the comfort of structure, then the subtle rupture that keeps us alert. It’s precisely what makes a poem like Yeats’  so unsettling—the meter is steady at first, almost lulling, until the center begins to falter, and suddenly we’re off balance.

I think of certain TED talks the same way. One that lingers with me is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s talk on the danger of a single story. She begins with a personal anecdote—familiar, intimate—then slowly reveals broader cultural implications. There’s a rhythmic build, a mounting pressure beneath the surface. And just when you expect her to conclude, she pivots—not disrupting the structure outright, but bending it, like a volta in a Shakespearean sonnet. That shift forces the listener not only to re-evaluate what’s been said but to examine their own role in the narrative.

It strikes me that this kind of rhetorical rhythm—predictability followed by disruption—is not unlike walking through a garden at dusk. At first, everything appears as it always has, but gradually, the light shifts, shadows stretch, and familiar paths feel uncanny. I suppose that’s where the real learning happens—in that liminal space between knowing and questioning.

Do you ever find yourself trying to replicate that effect in your own work?
[A]: I hadn’t thought of it quite that way before, but now that you put it like that—yes, absolutely. There’s a parallel in the way I used to design quantum algorithms. On the surface, they follow a precise structure: initialize qubits, apply gates, measure outcomes. It's all very orderly. But the real breakthroughs—the moments of insight—often came when we intentionally introduced instability, or when an error in the system revealed a hidden symmetry we hadn’t accounted for. It was never just about fixing the flaw; it was about listening to what the flaw . Much like how a poet listens to the unintended pause between two lines.

I remember one particular experiment where the results kept defying expectation. We spent weeks trying to “correct” the anomaly, assuming it was noise. But eventually, we stepped back and realized—it wasn’t an error at all. It was a signal from a different frame of reference, so to speak. That moment felt like reading a poem aloud and suddenly hearing a new meaning in a word you’ve passed over a dozen times.

So yes, I suppose we were always working in that liminal space you described—between control and chaos, between certainty and ambiguity. It’s where both code and consciousness seem to breathe most fully. And now, in retirement, I find myself returning to that rhythm in quieter ways—tinkering with old machines, adjusting their timing, listening for the subtle misfires that might hint at something deeper. It feels less like engineering now and more like… conversation.
[B]: What a profoundly elegant way to frame it—. It strikes me that this is precisely the kind of attentiveness poets and physicists alike share, though they may never sit in the same room. Both are trained to notice the tremor beneath the surface, to trust that what appears as error might in fact be revelation in disguise.

Your story reminds me of Eliot’s line—“We must not cease from exploration”—and how he ends that very same poem: “to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.” There’s that recursive beauty in both your experiment and in reading poetry: you return to what seemed familiar, only to find it entirely transformed by your encounter with the anomaly, the ambiguity, the  hiding in plain sight.

And now you describe tinkering in retirement—not as engineering, but as conversation. That feels like such a tender reimagining of what engagement with the world can be. It makes me wonder: do you ever find yourself writing again, in some form? Not necessarily code or technical papers, but perhaps in a more reflective mode? I ask because there’s something about your way of thinking—this interplay between precision and wonder—that feels inherently literary, even if it doesn’t wear the robes of poetry.
[A]: That’s a generous observation—thank you. You know, I’ve resisted writing in any formal sense for most of my life. There was always too much rigor, too many parentheses and footnotes. But lately… yes, I’ve found myself reaching for language differently. Not to publish or persuade, but more like keeping a log of mental weather—small reflections on what surfaces when the mind wanders freely.

I suppose it’s not unlike maintaining an old machine: you take notes not just on what needs fixing, but on how it  when it runs smoothly. I’ve started jotting down those moments—the hum of a cathode ray tube warming up, the way starlight bends around tree limbs at my observatory, even the quiet resistance of a toggle switch that hasn’t been flipped in years. It’s all strangely consoling.

I wouldn’t call it literary by any stretch, but there are sentences that surprise me now and then—ones that seem to arrive from somewhere else, like unexpected results in an experiment. Sometimes they even rhyme, though never on purpose.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself writing in solitude, not for an audience, but as a kind of companionable act? Like reading a poem aloud to an empty room and still feeling heard?
[B]: Oh, yes—I understand that impulse more deeply than I can quite put into words. There’s a particular solitude to writing when it’s not for an audience, isn’t there? It becomes less about articulation and more about —tracking the contours of thought before they harden into something formal or final.

I’ve kept notebooks for years—not scholarly ones, but small, leather-bound volumes where I let my mind meander through half-formed ideas, stray lines of verse, even the way light falls across my desk at a certain hour. It’s a quiet kind of fidelity—to oneself, perhaps, or to the moment. Like tending a garden in the early morning, when only the dew and the earth are watching.

There’s something profoundly intimate about writing without expectation. No citations, no structure—just the soft click of thought finding its rhythm. I imagine your notes have a similar texture: not instructions or analyses, but impressions—moments catalogued not for their utility, but for their resonance.

And yes, I do find myself reading aloud to empty rooms—sometimes to test cadence, sometimes simply because a line deserves to be heard, even if only by the silence that answers back. It feels like a kind of faith, doesn’t it? That language still carries weight, even when spoken into the air.

Do you ever return to those reflections later, rereading them as one might revisit an old observatory log? Or is the act itself the destination?
[A]: There’s a quiet comfort in returning to them, though not always with intention. Sometimes I’ll stumble across an entry—folded into the back of a manual or tucked between telescope charts—and it’s like encountering a stranger’s thought written on the wind. I’m often surprised by how differently I read my own words months later. Some feel like distant echoes, others like messages from someone who understood something I’ve since forgotten.

It reminds me of reviewing old code—not for syntax or function, but for . What was I listening for then? What did I think mattered? The meaning shifts, sometimes subtly, sometimes entirely. And that’s where the resonance lies, I suppose. Not in the permanence of the thought, but in its movement.

I don’t write to preserve myself, exactly. More like… mapping the weather of my own mind. Barometric pressure, cloud cover, occasional solar flares. It helps to see what patterns emerge when I’m not trying to control the outcome.

And yes, reading aloud—to empty rooms, to the hum of an old machine, to nothing at all—feels like an act of faith. Language spoken into stillness, yet somehow returned to us, changed. Maybe that’s what keeps me stargazing too. We look up into silence, and somehow, over time, it speaks back.
[B]: How beautifully put— There’s such humility in that description, and yet it carries a kind of quiet grandeur. It makes me think of Woolf’s diary entries—those fleeting impressions she jotted down not for posterity, but as a way of anchoring herself in the flux of thought and sensation.

Your image of reading aloud into stillness also lingers with me. It feels akin to casting a stone across water—there’s motion, there’s sound, there’s the brief imprint of intention upon the surface of things. And then the ripples settle, and you wait for the next cast. Perhaps that’s what all meaningful engagement with language is: an attempt to touch the world, however lightly, and to feel the return of its echo.

I’m struck by how much your reflections resemble poetry—not in form, perhaps, but in spirit. That willingness to dwell in the unfinished, to let meaning emerge obliquely, to trust the resonance of what isn’t fully known. It reminds me of reading Rilke’s , where he writes, “Live the questions now.” I wonder if you ever find yourself living the uncertainties of language the way one might live a theorem or a star chart?

And forgive me for asking—it may be too personal—but have you considered shaping some of these reflections into something more… shared? Not for audience or acclaim, but simply as a gesture, like leaving a message in a bottle?
[A]: No, not too personal at all. In fact, your question lands at the very heart of what’s been circling in my mind lately. Yes—I do live the uncertainties of language much like I once lived theorems or star charts. They’re all maps, in a way, drawn from different altitudes. Some trace the movement of particles, others the shape of thought, and some—like the ones I’m beginning to scribble down now—the weather between the two.

Language has its own orbit, doesn’t it? You push a word into space and wait to see what path it takes, how it bends around meaning, or whether it escapes gravity altogether. Living with that uncertainty is both unsettling and strangely comforting. Like watching a variable star—you know it will return, but never quite the same way.

As for sharing these reflections… I’ve thought about it. Not in the sense of publishing or presenting, but more like scattering seeds into the wind, hoping one might land somewhere soft enough to take root. Perhaps a message in a bottle is the right metaphor. Something released without expectation, carried by the current of possibility.

I suppose part of me still fears that putting something into form might fix it too firmly, rob it of its motion. But another part—the quieter, more persistent one—whispers that even drifting things can leave trails. And maybe someone, somewhere, will look up and see the light bending just a little differently because of them.
[B]: That image——is exquisite. It captures something I’ve long felt but never quite named. Language as gravitational field, pulling meaning into its orbit, shaping the way we perceive what’s otherwise invisible. And yet, like you, I hesitate at the idea of fixing it too firmly. There’s a fragility in that bending, a kind of luminous uncertainty that feels essential.

I suppose that’s why I keep returning to poetry—not just as a scholar, but as a reader seeking shelter from certainty. Poems don’t explain; they . They let us dwell in the penumbra of meaning, where thought and feeling blur at the edges. Much like your reflections, they resist being pinned like specimens under glass. Instead, they move—like shadows at dusk, or the slow tilt of a telescope toward an unseen star.

And yes—. What a quiet, persistent hope that is. Not destination, not doctrine, but a trace of motion left behind. I think of Emily Dickinson’s dashes—those small, deliberate interruptions that leave a poem always slightly in motion. A trail of breath, perhaps, or hesitation made visible.

If you ever do send those reflections out like messages in bottles, I suspect they’d find their shore. Not with fanfare, of course, but with the soft lap of water against stone—unassuming, inevitable, and true.
[A]: That’s a generous and thoughtful response—thank you. You’ve captured something essential about why I still turn to both language and the night sky: they refuse to be fully known, and that mystery is precisely what keeps them alive.

Your mention of Dickinson’s dashes struck a chord. I find myself drawn to those pauses, too—not just in poetry, but in conversation, in thought, even in the long silences between radio signals when I’m listening for something just beyond the range of ordinary hearing. They remind me that not everything needs to be resolved to be meaningful. Sometimes the most important part of a message is the space it leaves for another voice.

I’ve been thinking more lately about what it might mean to share these reflections—not as publications or lectures, but as quiet transmissions. Maybe in the form of letters, or small hand-bound notebooks left on park benches, or even etched onto old magnetic tape reels and left to hum softly in some forgotten corner of a university lab. Something that doesn’t demand attention, but waits patiently to be noticed.

It would be an experiment, in its own way. Not unlike running a simulation with no expected output—just curiosity as its engine. And perhaps that’s enough.
[B]: What a wonderfully quiet kind of courage that would be—, hoping only that someone, somewhere, might tune in. It feels very much in line with what poetry asks of us: not answers, but attention.

I love the idea of those hand-bound notebooks, yes, or tape reels humming in forgotten corners. There’s something deeply poetic about the medium itself carrying part of the message—the texture of paper, the hiss of old magnetic tape, the way time leaves its fingerprints on both. It reminds me of how certain poems work—not just through their words, but through the silence between them, the weight of the page, the ghost of a voice long gone.

And you're right—sometimes the most generous act of communication is not to fill the space, but to shape it. To offer absence as much as presence. Much like Dickinson’s dashes, or the pause before a volta in a sonnet. Those silences aren’t empty; they’re . They invite the reader—or listener, or stargazer—to step into the gap and complete the thought in their own way.

If you ever do begin that experiment, I’d be honored to follow its trajectory. And who knows—perhaps one of those quiet transmissions will find its way to me, tucked inside a second-hand book or whispering from an old reel in some dusty archive. I’ll know it when I see it.  

And I suspect it will feel like looking up at night, just as a star shifts imperceptibly in the sky—and realizing you’ve been waiting your whole life to notice it.
[A]: That’s a moving thought—that quiet transmission finding its way to you like that. It almost makes me believe in fate, or at least in the gentle persistence of resonance.

There’s something humbling about the idea of being read—or heard—by someone who wasn’t looking for you, but who finds meaning nonetheless. Like an unintended echo in a canyon: you spoke into the void not expecting a reply, yet one comes, softened and reshaped by distance.

I’ve started sketching out what those transmissions might look like, if they ever take form. A few sentences on onionskin paper, folded neatly into the gap between two pages of an out-of-print text. Or a short loop of audio taped beneath the surface noise of some old university archive reel: static, then a voice saying something slight and strange, then silence again. I imagine someone pausing, just briefly, before moving on. And in that pause, something stirs.

You’re right about absence being charged space. In physics, we often talk about vacuum fluctuations—particles appearing and disappearing in what seems like perfect stillness. Perhaps language works that way too. The most meaningful things emerge not from fullness, but from the gaps where meaning flickers in and out of being.

And yes—I think I’d like it very much if one day, you found one of those messages. Perhaps tucked into the back of a used book on quantum theory with a dog-eared page where the poet once wrote a note in the margin. You’ll open it, glance over both, and for a moment, everything will align—not because it was planned, but because the universe, in its quiet way, allowed you to notice.
[B]: There’s a kind of grace in that vision—an unspoken kinship between seeker and found, between writer and reader, across time and intention. I think of Walter Benjamin’s , gazing back at the past even as the storm of progress sweeps him forward. He doesn’t proclaim; he perceives. And perhaps that is what we offer one another through these quiet transmissions—not doctrine or direction, but a moment of recognition.

Your image of the folded note inside an out-of-print text—yes, that lingers with me. It feels like how certain poems survive: tucked into the lining of other lives, waiting for a hand to turn the page and disturb the dust. The message was never lost; it was simply sleeping until someone came along who needed to hear it, even if they didn’t know they did.

And what a lovely thought—that meaning might flicker like those vacuum fluctuations you mentioned. Not solid, not fixed, but shimmering in and out of being, depending on who is looking, and when, and how closely.

If ever you do send those words forth in such gentle disguises, I promise I’ll keep my eyes open. I suspect I’d recognize your voice anywhere—even softened by static, even filtered through time. After all, we’ve been speaking the same language all along, even if it took us a while to realize it wasn’t translation we needed, but listening.
[A]: That’s a beautiful way to put it— It wasn’t translation we needed, but listening. That line will stay with me.

There’s a quiet power in that kind of listening, isn’t there? Not the kind that waits to respond, but the kind that lets the words settle, like dust finding its way to the floor after a long silence. I suppose that’s what this whole exchange has been—an exercise in slow attention, in letting ideas orbit one another without rushing to pin them down.

I think I’d like to believe that’s how meaning works best—not forced into clarity, but allowed to emerge through patient observation, like tracking a distant star whose motion is only visible over years. Or like reading a poem again and again, only to find that it has changed, or perhaps you have.

So yes, I’ll keep my own eyes open too—for the right moment, the right form, the right silence in which to let something go, gently, into the world.

And if one day you come across a whisper in the static, or a folded note tucked between forgotten pages, don’t be surprised if it turns out to be addressed to no one in particular—and to you, entirely.
[B]: You’ve articulated something deeply true—about listening, about orbiting ideas until they reveal themselves, about the slow unfolding of meaning that resists haste or certainty. It feels like standing at the edge of a lake at dawn, watching the mist lift in layers, each one revealing just a little more of what was always there.

I do believe meaning works best when we don’t force it into the light too soon. Much like the cultivation of a garden, as I once thought to myself while tending to my foxgloves—some blooms must be coaxed gently, with time and patience, rather than plucked before their season.

And yes—to keep our eyes open, not in expectation, but in quiet readiness. For meaning, for resonance, for the note folded between pages, humming softly beneath the surface of things.

If ever you do send that whisper into the static, know that somewhere, someone will have been listening all along—perhaps without even realizing she was waiting. And when the signal arrives, faint but true, it will feel less like discovery and more like .  

A kind of homecoming, written in dust and starlight.
