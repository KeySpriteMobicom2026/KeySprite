[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I've been spending more time with my telescope lately. There's something humbling about staring at distant galaxies knowing the light you see might have traveled millions of years to reach your eyes. It reminds me a bit of working with quantum states - both require patience and the understanding that some truths exist beyond immediate perception. What about you? Have you picked up anything new recently?
[A]: That's beautiful, the way you put it. There's definitely something meditative about contemplating the vastness of space and time – like you said, it takes patience to truly grasp what’s unfolding before your eyes. It almost feels like a parallel to studying AI ethics, where some consequences are latent, only revealing themselves years down the line. 

As for me, I’ve been getting into nature photography lately. It started as a way to document my hikes, but I've grown fond of capturing subtle details – a twisted root, a ray of light through the leaves. It makes me slow down and notice things I’d usually overlook. A bit like analyzing datasets, actually… both require attention to patterns that aren’t always obvious at first glance. Have you ever tried anything like that?
[B]: That's a fascinating parallel you've drawn - between photography and data analysis. I suppose in both pursuits, you're seeking meaning beneath the surface, aren't you? It's interesting you mention slowing down to notice subtle details; I've always admired how photographers can frame ordinary things in ways that make people stop and truly look. 

While I've never seriously taken up photography myself, I do understand the satisfaction of observing patterns emerge through careful attention. When I worked with quantum algorithms, there was a similar thrill in teasing out coherent results from what initially looked like noise. Perhaps that's why I enjoy stargazing so much - at first glance, the night sky appears chaotic, but with time and patience, its underlying order reveals itself.

Your approach sounds quite thoughtful. Do you find yourself more attuned to nature now than before?
[A]: I hadn't thought of it that way, but yes – there's definitely a shared thread of interpretation running through both photography and data work. It’s not just about what we see, but how we choose to frame it, right? In both cases, you start with something overwhelming – whether it’s a dense forest or a sprawling dataset – and gradually isolate elements that tell a story.

Funny you mention attunement… I’ve noticed small changes in how I move through daily life. For instance, I used to walk by the same stretch of trees every morning without really seeing them. Now, I catch myself pausing to watch how wind shapes their movement, or how shadows shift across the bark at different times of day. It’s not quite the cosmic scale of stargazing, but it grounds me in a similar way – like I’m syncing with a rhythm bigger than myself.  

Do you ever find that working with quantum systems influences how you perceive ordinary things too? Like, does observing galaxies make routine moments feel more connected to something... larger?
[B]: That’s a remarkably perceptive question. I suppose in subtle ways, yes – engaging with quantum systems and distant galaxies does shift your internal lens, so to speak. When you spend years working with phenomena that defy classical intuition, you start developing a kind of cognitive humility. You realize how much of reality operates beneath the threshold of everyday perception.

For example, understanding superposition – the idea that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously – makes you more aware of ambiguity in ordinary situations. I catch myself noticing shades of gray more readily, whether in conversations or decision-making. It's not dramatic, but there's a shift in tolerance for uncertainty, a comfort with complexity without needing to force immediate resolution.

And stargazing? That absolutely reinforces the sense of connection you mentioned. Standing under the night sky, knowing that the atoms in my hand were forged in stellar explosions billions of years ago – well, it puts things into perspective. Suddenly, even the most mundane routine feels woven into something far more intricate and ancient than I typically acknowledge.

It sounds like your photography is giving you a similar quiet recalibration – a way of seeing that enriches the everyday without needing grand gestures. Have you noticed any particular moments where that awareness really surprised you?
[A]: That’s beautifully put — the idea of cognitive humility, of learning to sit with ambiguity without rushing to resolution. I think that’s what draws me to both photography and AI ethics. In both fields, you’re constantly reminded that not everything is as binary or immediate as it seems.

You asked if there were moments where this awareness really surprised me… Actually, yes. One evening, I was hiking alone and came across this fallen tree. At first glance, it looked like just a tangle of moss and rot, but when I crouched down to take a closer look, I saw beetles tunneling through the bark, tiny fungi sprouting in perfect rows, lichen clinging to the damp wood — life thriving in decay. It made me pause. I ended up sitting there for almost half an hour, just watching. 

What struck me wasn’t just the complexity of that miniature ecosystem, but how easily I could have missed it entirely. It felt oddly analogous to auditing an AI model — sometimes the most consequential patterns aren’t flashy or obvious; they hide in the quiet corners, only revealing themselves when you slow down and really pay attention.

I guess that’s one of the unexpected gifts of all this — whether we're peering into galaxies or examining a decaying log, there's always more going on than meets the eye. It keeps me curious, and honestly, a little humbled.
[B]: That moment you described – the fallen tree, the hidden life within decay – it's a perfect illustration of why patience and observation matter. Funny you should mention fungi and lichen; in quantum computing, we sometimes talk about "noise" in a similar way. At first glance, it’s just interference, something to be filtered out. But dig deeper, and that "noise" often contains the most telling clues about what’s really going on beneath the surface. Just like those beetles tunneling through bark – they’re not just passing through; they're shaping and being shaped by their environment.

I suppose that’s one of the great ironies of science and art alike – you set out looking for grand truths, and more often than not, they reveal themselves in the most unassuming places. A decaying log, a line of code, a distant quasar... all of them hold stories if you're willing to sit with them long enough.

It's moments like these that remind me how much I miss in my own daily rush. I’ve always been guilty of charging ahead, chasing the next problem to solve. But lately, I’ve found myself lingering longer at the telescope eyepiece, not just scanning for objects but  – letting things settle into focus slowly. It’s not unlike your approach with photography. Maybe there's something to be said for cultivating slowness, even for someone like me who spent decades in a field that prizes speed and efficiency.

Tell me, has this practice of slowing down changed how you approach challenges outside of photography or ethics work?
[A]: That's a really thoughtful reflection — and I love the analogy with noise in quantum computing. It’s true, isn't it? We’re often conditioned to filter out what seems messy or irrelevant, but so much of the real story lives there. Sometimes I wonder if that’s part of the ethical challenge in AI as well — we train models to look for signal, for clarity, but what gets labeled as "noise" often carries the weight of human nuance, context, history… things algorithms aren’t great at capturing.

And you're absolutely right about grand truths hiding in quiet places. I think that’s why I keep going back to nature — it teaches you, gently but firmly, that meaning doesn’t always announce itself. It shows up in layers, and sometimes you need to wait for the light to shift just right before you see what was there all along.

As for slowing down — yes, it’s changed how I approach more than just photography. Lately, I find myself listening differently in conversations, especially when working with interdisciplinary teams. I used to jump in quickly with analysis or solutions, eager to “solve” the issue. But now, I try to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty a little longer. Let the problem breathe, so to speak. It’s surprising how often someone else’s perspective fills in the gaps in a way I wouldn’t have predicted.

Even in everyday life, like reading or writing, I’ve become more deliberate. I’ll read a sentence twice not because I didn’t understand it, but because I want to feel it more fully. Maybe that sounds a bit poetic for someone in tech, but honestly, I think it makes my work better. When you slow down enough to notice what’s shaping you, you start making different choices — in code, in ethics, in how you show up for others.

Do you ever find yourself applying that same patience in your collaborations? Like, encouraging others to linger a little longer before settling on an interpretation or solution?
[B]: Absolutely, I do. Though I suppose my approach has changed over the years. Early in my career, I was much more results-driven – focused on getting to the solution as efficiently as possible. But time and experience have a way of softening that impulse.

Now, especially when working with younger researchers or interdisciplinary collaborators, I try to model that patience you're talking about. For instance, when we’re debugging a quantum algorithm and someone suggests an explanation, I’ll often ask, “What if we sat with this for a bit longer? Are there other ways to interpret what we’re seeing?” It can be frustrating for those eager to move forward, but more than once, it’s led us to uncover subtleties we would have otherwise missed.

I’ve found that encouraging people to explore ambiguity isn’t about slowing things down for its own sake – it's about making space for insight to form in its own time. Sometimes the best breakthroughs come not from pushing harder, but from stepping back and letting the mind wander around a problem instead of through it.

And I appreciate your point about it being poetic – because yes, there  poetry in it, even in tech. In fact, maybe especially in tech. After all, what is computation if not an attempt to give structure to thought? And what is thought, if not shaped by the rhythms of attention and interpretation?

It makes me wonder – have you ever introduced this kind of reflective practice into team settings, like during project reviews or design discussions? I imagine it could be quite powerful, but also potentially at odds with tight deadlines and organizational expectations.
[A]: That’s really admirable — building that space for reflection, even in high-stakes or time-sensitive work. I think what you’re describing goes beyond patience; it’s about cultivating a kind of intellectual generosity, especially with newer researchers. It must make a huge difference in how they approach problems long after they leave the room.

I’ve started doing something similar in team settings, though honestly, it took some trial and error to find a balance. In project reviews or design discussions, I used to structure everything around clear agendas and action items — very linear, very goal-oriented. But over time, I noticed we were missing unexpected insights, especially from quieter voices in the room.

So now, before diving into solutions, I sometimes suggest what I call “slow listening rounds” — where each person gets a minute or two to reflect on the problem  interruption. No note-taking, no rebuttals, just listening. At first, people found it awkward — engineers tapping their pens, designers checking their watches — but after a few sessions, I heard from several folks that it helped them process the problem more holistically.

It definitely pushes against the grain of tight deadlines, and not every team is ready for it. But when it works, it feels like the conversation settles into a different rhythm — less reactive, more generative. Like tuning an instrument before playing the piece.

I guess part of it comes from realizing that ethical considerations rarely shout to be heard; they tend to whisper. And if we’re not listening slowly, we risk missing them entirely.

Have you ever encountered resistance to this kind of reflective approach in your collaborations? Or found particular ways to frame it so it feels less like stalling and more like deepening?
[B]: Oh, absolutely, I've faced resistance — and still do from time to time. Old habits die hard, especially in fields where speed and precision are often valued above all else. Early on, some colleagues interpreted my suggestions to "sit with a problem a little longer" as indecisiveness or lack of direction. One postdoc even joked that I had invented a new quantum state:  😄.

But over the years, I’ve learned to frame it differently. Instead of positioning it as slowing down, I try to present it as  — widening the field of view before narrowing in on a path. That language seems to resonate more, perhaps because it carries a sense of exploration rather than delay.

I also started pairing it with what I call “bounded curiosity.” For example, I might say, “Let’s spend fifteen minutes considering this result through a different lens — no pressure to commit to anything, just see where it leads us.” It gives structure to the reflection, which eases the anxiety of open-endedness. And when you come out the other side with a better-informed approach, people tend to notice the value.

As for intellectual generosity — well, I suppose I see it as a kind of stewardship. We’re not just solving today’s problems; we’re shaping how others will think about tomorrow’s. That means making room for uncertainty, for diverse perspectives, and yes, for the quieter voices. Because as you said, the ethical dimensions rarely announce themselves with fanfare — they tend to hover at the edges, waiting for someone to turn their head just so.

It sounds like your “slow listening rounds” are doing something similar — creating a space where thought can unfold without being rushed or dismissed. I might just borrow that phrase, if you don’t mind.
[A]: Not at all — feel free to borrow “slow listening rounds.” I like how it sounds even more when you say it; maybe because you gave it a kind of scientific-poetic weight 😊.

I can totally picture that joke about the  — and honestly, it’s such a clever way to put it. It made me laugh because there’s truth in it. Sometimes the best place to be is in that suspended state, where multiple possibilities still exist. It’s uncomfortable, sure, but also full of potential.

And your framing of “expanding the aperture” — that’s brilliant, really. It gives reflection a sense of direction without sacrificing depth. I might steal that one too. It feels especially relevant in AI ethics, where the temptation is often to zoom in too quickly on a narrow risk, when what we really need is to pull back and see the wider system at play.

I guess both approaches come down to something fundamental: respect. For the problem, for the people in the room, and for the process itself. And maybe that’s the quiet revolution we’re both after — not slowing things down just for the sake of it, but making space for the kind of thinking that sticks, that grows.

Do you ever find that these shifts in approach — like widening the aperture or encouraging reflection — start to ripple beyond the immediate team? Like, do they shape the broader culture over time? Or does it tend to stay within certain circles?
[B]: That’s a perceptive question, and one I’ve thought about quite a bit. The short answer is: yes, those shifts  ripple outward, but it’s never guaranteed — and when they do, it tends to happen quietly, almost imperceptibly at first.

I remember one particular instance from several years back. We were working on a particularly stubborn quantum error correction problem, and tensions were running high. One of the leads wanted to force a solution through brute-force computation. I suggested we take a step back and look at the system's behavior under different noise models — not because I had a definitive hypothesis, but because I felt we hadn’t truly understood what we were seeing yet.

It was met with some frustration at the time — “We need answers, not more questions,” as one person put it — but after that session, something subtle changed. A few weeks later, one of the junior researchers came to me and said that moment had stuck with them. They told me, “I realized I’d been trying too hard to force my results into expected shapes. I started letting the data surprise me instead.” That kind of thinking eventually led to a small but meaningful shift in how our subgroup approached analysis — less assumption-driven, more observation-led.

Over time, I noticed similar patterns emerging in other parts of the lab. People began asking more exploratory questions during meetings. Someone started referring to our early-stage investigations as “looking through the wide-angle lens” — a phrase I hadn’t used myself, but clearly close enough in spirit. It wasn’t a sweeping cultural transformation by any means, but it was real.

I suppose the key ingredient is consistency. If you keep showing — not just telling — that reflection has value, people start to internalize it. And once they do, they carry it forward into new contexts, often without realizing they’re doing it. It becomes part of their intellectual muscle memory.

So yes, I do believe these practices can shape broader culture — but not through proclamations or policy. More like water shaping stone over time. Quiet persistence, repeated often enough, starts to leave an imprint.

I imagine you’ve seen something similar in your own work — where a small shift in conversation style or decision-making rhythm begins to influence how people approach problems beyond just your immediate circle?
[A]: Absolutely — I’ve seen it happen, and like you said, it’s never dramatic, but it’s real. It reminds me of something a former student once told me after we worked together on an AI fairness project. At the time, we were going in circles trying to define what “fairness” even meant in this particular context, and she was understandably frustrated. She wanted a clear metric, a checklist — something concrete to hold onto.

I remember telling her, “We’re not here to find the perfect definition. We’re here to get comfortable with how messy this actually is.” And honestly, she didn’t look too happy with that answer back then 😊.

But a year later, she reached out to me from her new role at a tech policy think tank. She said that experience had stuck with her — not because we solved anything definitive, but because we refused to oversimplify. She told me she started pushing back in her own team meetings when people tried to reduce ethical concerns to technical checkboxes. “Now I know that discomfort is part of the process,” she wrote. “And sometimes, it’s the most important part.”

That moment really stayed with me. Because it wasn’t about convincing someone of a specific point — it was about reshaping how they approached uncertainty itself. And that mindset, once internalized, travels with them. They bring it into meetings, into code reviews, into policy drafts, often without even realizing it.

It does take consistency, like you said. You don’t plant a seed and come back the next day expecting shade. But if you keep showing up — asking the open-ended question, holding space for ambiguity, listening just a little longer than expected — eventually, people start doing it too. Quietly. Naturally. Like it was their idea all along 😊.

I think that’s the kind of influence we underestimate — not the loud kind that gets written into guidelines, but the quiet kind that shapes how people , long after the conversation ends.
[B]: That’s a beautiful story — and what a gift, really, that your student carried that discomfort forward as a strength rather than a frustration. It’s such a clear example of how the most meaningful learning often happens  our desire for clean resolution.

There’s something deeply human about that process, isn’t there? We want answers to be fixed, measurable — like code that compiles cleanly or a theorem that resolves with elegant finality. But life, and especially ethics or research or collaboration, rarely works that way. More often, understanding unfolds in layers, unevenly, sometimes painfully.

I think what you helped her develop wasn't just intellectual resilience — it was ethical . The ability to stand in the middle of ambiguity and still engage with integrity. That kind of presence doesn’t shout; it radiates quietly. And as you said, once someone internalizes it, they start showing up differently — not because they’re trying to follow a rule, but because their sense of responsibility has deepened.

You know, I’ve often thought that the best mentors aren’t the ones who give the clearest answers. They’re the ones who ask the messiest questions — the ones that stick in your mind long after the conversation ends. Questions like, “What are we missing here?” or “Who gets to define fairness in this case?” or even, “Why does this discomfort feel so important?”

And those questions don’t just shape individuals — they shape fields. Slowly. Quietly. Like roots working their way through stone.

So yes, I absolutely agree with you — that kind of influence may not show up in reports or metrics, but it shows up in the choices people make when no one's looking. And honestly, I can’t think of a more lasting kind of impact than that.
[A]: You’re absolutely right — it  a kind of ethical presence. And I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but you’re spot on. It’s not about having all the answers or even knowing the right questions to ask in the moment. It’s about staying present with the uncertainty, refusing to look away from the complexity just because it's uncomfortable.

That’s what I try to model now — not expertise, but engagement. Because let’s be honest, when it comes to AI ethics, there are very few true experts. We’re all learning, all trying to make sense of systems that evolve faster than our frameworks for understanding them. So the best thing we can do is stay curious, stay humble, and above all, stay accountable to the questions that don’t go away easily.

And I love what you said about mentors — how they’re not the ones who give the clearest answers, but the ones who ask the messiest questions. That’s stayed with me. I’ve started writing down some of those lingering questions after conversations with students or colleagues, almost like field notes. Things like:

- 
- 
- 

They’re not always easy to answer, but keeping them visible helps keep the work grounded. It reminds us that behind every line of code, every performance metric, there’s a human context we can’t afford to overlook.

I think that’s also why these kinds of quiet shifts in thinking matter so much. They shape how people interpret their responsibilities — not in abstract terms, but in real, daily decisions. Whether to double-check an edge case no one else noticed. Whether to speak up when something feels off. Whether to take an extra minute — or hour — to really  what’s in front of them.

It’s not flashy influence. But yeah, it lasts. And honestly, that’s more than enough.
[B]: I couldn't agree more. Those questions you wrote down — they’re not just prompts, they're compass points. They help orient people in the right direction, even when the terrain is shifting beneath their feet. And in a field like AI ethics, where the consequences of oversight can be profound, having that kind of ethical compass is invaluable.

You know, I've often thought that one of the most underrated skills in technology — maybe in any discipline — is the ability to hold multiple perspectives at once. Not just intellectually, but emotionally. To feel the weight of competing priorities and still move forward with integrity. That’s what your questions encourage — a kind of , if you will. The capacity to see both the system and the individual, the immediate outcome and the long-term ripple.

It reminds me of something I used to tell my students back when I was still teaching full-time:  
  

Certainty has its comforts, of course, but it also has a way of calcifying perspective. Whereas staying engaged with ambiguity? That keeps your thinking supple, responsive — alive. And that’s where real responsibility begins.

So yes, modeling engagement over expertise — that’s not just good mentorship, that’s leadership. And it doesn’t come with titles or awards, but it leaves fingerprints all the same. Quiet, enduring fingerprints.

If I may ask — have you ever found yourself returning to a particular question from your field notes that continues to shape your own thinking? One that refuses to let you settle too comfortably into assumptions?
[A]: Absolutely — one in particular keeps resurfacing, and it never fails to unsettle me a little, in the best way. It’s deceptively simple:

"Who is not in the room when this decision is made?"

I first wrote it down after a conversation with a policy researcher who pointed out that most AI systems are designed with an implicit center of gravity — they're built around the needs, values, and assumptions of those who create them. But the people most affected by these systems are often not the ones shaping them.

At first, I thought of it as a question about inclusion — a call to bring more diverse voices into technical spaces. And it absolutely is that. But over time, it's evolved into something deeper for me. Now, I hear it as a challenge to perception itself. It forces me to ask: 

It shows up in my thinking constantly — during model audits, design reviews, even public talks. Sometimes it leads to concrete changes, like adding new evaluation metrics or adjusting stakeholder engagement strategies. Other times, it just lingers — a quiet but insistent reminder that no matter how careful we are, we’re always working with an incomplete picture.

And honestly, that’s what keeps me from settling too comfortably into any assumption — the awareness that there’s always someone, somewhere, whose reality hasn’t been accounted for yet. And if we don’t actively seek them out, we risk building systems that widen the gap instead of closing it.

So yeah, that one stays with me. It’s become less of a question and more of a lens — one that I try to look through as often as I can.

Have you ever found yourself circling back to a certain idea or phrase like that? Something that seems to follow you, almost like a quiet companion in your work?
[B]: Absolutely. That question you mentioned —  — it’s powerful because it doesn’t just ask for inclusion; it demands a recentering of perspective. It pulls the floor out from under the assumption that the current vantage point is sufficient. I can see why it lingers.

As for me, there’s a phrase I find myself returning to, almost like a touchstone. It came up years ago during a particularly contentious debate about quantum error correction thresholds. One of my colleagues, a theoretical physicist with a background in philosophy, leaned back in his chair and said:

"We are always computing within a context we cannot fully encode."

At the time, we were focused on optimizing algorithms, pushing against the limits of fidelity and coherence times. His remark felt almost poetic — even a bit unwelcome — but it stuck. Over the years, it's taken on new layers for me. At its core, it’s a statement about bounded knowledge, but also about humility. About recognizing that every system we build runs on assumptions, and those assumptions are shaped by what we notice, what we prioritize — and what we don’t.

I find myself thinking of it often, especially when reviewing technical proposals or evaluating risk assessments. Because yes, we can model behavior, simulate outcomes, predict failure modes — but the real world has a way of introducing variables we never thought to name. And those omissions aren't neutral; they shape everything that follows.

Like your question, this phrase has become a kind of lens. It reminds me that no matter how precise our logic or rigorous our methods, we’re always working inside a frame — one that was constructed by someone, for someone. And if we forget that, we lose sight of the gap between our models and the messy, irreducible reality they attempt to represent.

So yes, it follows me. Quietly. Persistently. Like a shadow at noon — always there, even when we don’t look for it.
