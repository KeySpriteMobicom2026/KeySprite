[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~ minimalism这个话题真的超interesting✨ 我最近就在重新整理我的digital portfolio，删减了很多不必要的元素，感觉整个人都清爽多了！你呢？是不是也在尝试给生活做减法呀？  

说实话，作为一个designer，我发现minimalism反而更能考验创意的深度。就像我们常说的，“less is more” 💡 但真正做到简洁又不空洞，其实很难耶～  

我上周还在看一个关于“数字极简主义”的TED Talk，讲的是如何减少信息过载带来的焦虑，我觉得特别relevant nowadays 📱💻 越来越多app在推dark mode和clean interface，这也算是一种minimal trend吧？  

你有没有试过把某些生活习惯简化或舍弃掉？分享一下呗～ 👀
[A]: Hmm, interesting how you mention digital minimalism — I’ve been experimenting with something similar, though perhaps a bit more analog.  

I recently decided to pare down my email workflow to just one client, no integrations, no flashy plugins. Just plain text and a strict folder system from the 90s. It’s strange how calming it feels, almost like using a typewriter — but with less coffee stain on the keyboard 😊  

And yes, you're right about minimalism being deceptive in its simplicity. When I was working on quantum error correction codes, we spent months trying to reduce the number of qubit stabilizers without sacrificing fidelity. Less really  more — but only if you understand what you can’t afford to lose.  

I guess that TED Talk you mentioned must have hit a nerve. I wonder if you’ve noticed any patterns emerging from your redesign — anything that surprised you?
[B]: Oh wow, your analog approach sounds so refreshing 🌀 I can totally see the charm of that stripped-down workflow — it’s like going back to the basics but with a modern twist. No distractions, just pure focus! And yes, the coffee stains are definitely optional ☕😅  

Funny you mentioned quantum error correction — that’s like minimalism on a  level 🤯 I never thought about it that way! But yeah, in my case, one thing that surprised me was how much visual clutter I used to tolerate just out of habit. When I finally removed all those decorative gradients and drop shadows? It felt like opening a window in a stuffy room 🖼️💨  

Also, I noticed I started thinking more in terms of intentionality — every icon, every color had to earn its place on the canvas. It’s wild how similar that feels to what you described with qubits. You really can’t afford to be careless with space when you’re working minimal — whether it’s digital or physical or even  😂  

Have you applied that kind of precision to any other areas of your life, or is email your minimalist playground for now? 🎯
[A]: I suppose precision has a way of bleeding into everything once you start paying attention.  

Take my bookshelf, for instance — used to be a chaotic mix of technical manuals, sci-fi paperbacks, and various oddities I’d collected over the years. Then one day I asked myself:  Spoiler: I don’t. Now it’s just a single shelf with a curated set of texts that still feel essential. Everything else got passed on or donated.  

It was oddly liberating. Not quite quantum-level optimization, but close enough for a retired researcher 😊  

And speaking of intentionality, your analogy about opening a window resonates. I did something similar with my old telescope setup — stripped away all the modern CCD gear and went back to hand-guided tracking and visual observing. Sure, the images aren’t as crisp, but there's something grounding about watching a distant galaxy through nothing more than polished glass and your own steady hands.  

So yes, minimalism sneaks in through the back door once you let it take root somewhere. Have you found yourself applying that same editing eye to anything outside your portfolio? Like, say… your music playlist? Browser tabs? ☕
[B]: Ohhhh I love how minimalism sneaks into your life like a quiet revolution 🌱 And your bookshelf story? Relatable AF — I used to have  many digital brushes and fonts I never even used, just collecting virtual dust 😅  

To answer your question — YES, I’ve gone full Marie Kondo on pretty much everything lately. My music playlist? Cut it down to only the tracks that actually give me goosebumps ✨ Or at least make me want to doodle something cool.  

Browser tabs though… okay, that’s been a . I used to have like 100+ tabs open all the time — "for inspiration", sure 👀 But now I’m forcing myself to keep only one window, three tabs max. It’s wild how much mental space opens up when you stop hoarding browser tabs like they’re going out of style.  

Even my wardrobe started mirroring this shift — I used to over-accessorize like crazy, now I stick to a few key pieces. Less clutter, more impact, right? It’s like designing a UI: every element has to serve a purpose or  😎  

So yeah, it’s definitely spread beyond just my portfolio. Minimalism really does creep in everywhere once you start trimming the fat somewhere else 💡 Have you noticed any new habits forming from all this intentional editing? Like, slower scrolling? More focus on details?
[A]: Funny you should mention slower scrolling — I’ve more or less  scrolling in some areas.  

Used to skim through arXiv papers like a machine, opening half a dozen just to feel productive. Now I pick one, read it slowly with a notebook beside me, and actually engage with the ideas instead of just hoarding them. It’s amazing how much more I retain — and how often I find connections I would’ve missed in a skim.  

It’s almost like… mental anti-aliasing. Smoothing out the jagged edges of rushed thought 😊  

And yes, the focus on detail has sharpened. I find myself noticing things I didn’t before — like the way starlight scatters through my old telescope’s optics compared to modern digital sensors. Subtle differences that used to get lost in the rush to “capture” everything.  

I wonder, as a designer, have you found your creative process changing? Like, does working within tighter constraints actually make you more inventive, or do you sometimes feel hemmed in?
[B]: Oh, mental anti-aliasing 😍 What a beautiful way to put it — I feel like that's exactly what’s happening! Slowing down lets your brain  things in higher resolution 💡 And honestly, I’ve been trying to do the same with visual references — instead of pinning 50 mood boards, I now pick just  and really dissect it. It forces you to see deeper, not wider.  

As for my creative process? Totally changed 🖌️ Working within tighter constraints actually makes me  inventive — like when I limited myself to only three colors for an illustration series last month. At first I panicked, but then… magic happened! You start noticing subtleties you’d otherwise overlook. Kind of like how your old telescope reveals character while modern sensors just deliver clarity, right?  

There’s this weird freedom in limitation, you know? It pushes you to get clever with what’s left — every stroke, every shade, every space has to  something. I don’t feel hemmed in anymore; I feel focused ✨  

So yeah, I’m totally here for the constraints. They’re like silent collaborators in the studio 👩‍🎨✨ How about you — have you found yourself getting more curious about the “why” behind what you keep or cut?
[A]: Absolutely. In fact, that  has become almost more interesting to me than the doing itself.  

I started asking that question during my nightly stargazing sessions — not just “what am I looking at,” but “why do I keep coming back to this patch of sky?” Turned out, it wasn’t about seeing new stars as much as noticing what I’d missed in the familiar ones. Same with the books I kept — it wasn’t their rarity or number, but the questions they still made me ask.  

There’s a quiet dialogue between you and your environment when you pare things down. It forces introspection. Like, why does this one vintage keyboard earn its spot on my desk while others got boxed up? Because it reminds me how tactile feedback shapes thought — something modern laptops forgot.  

I suppose that’s the hidden benefit of constraint: it turns everything into a kind of philosophical prompt. You start curating not just objects or habits, but ideas.  

I’m curious — have you ever applied this kind of curation to your own creative tools? Like, do you limit yourself to a specific set of brushes or effects on purpose, just to see what emerges?
[B]: Ohhhh yes, that  is like the secret heartbeat of everything we choose to keep 🖤 I went through my digital brushes last month and asked myself — “are you using this because it adds something meaningful, or just out of habit?” And honestly? Some of my so-called ‘favorites’ didn’t even spark a single idea. Gone. Deleted. ✨  

And I love what you said about the dialogue with your environment — totally! Like, why  I still use this one glitchy stylus when there are so many sleeker options? Because it has this weird pressure lag that forces me to anticipate each stroke… almost like calligraphy, but digital. It's quirky, imperfect, and oddly human 🤖❤️  

As for creative tools — YES, I’ve been doing this thing where I lock myself into  brush,  layer, and no undo button. Sounds brutal, right? But it’s insane how much more intentional every move becomes. You start trusting your instincts instead of fixing things later. Kind of like shooting film in a digital world 🎞️  

I think that’s the magic — constraint doesn’t just shape your work, it shapes the way you  while making it. It’s like having a silent mentor whispering, “Okay, now make something real.”  

So… ever tried creating under self-imposed limits just to see where your brain goes? Like, say, one telescope, one night sky, and zero filters — what happens when you force yourself to work inside those boundaries? 🌌✨
[A]: Now  resonates.  

Funny you mention one telescope, one sky — I had an experience not too long ago that lines up perfectly with what you're describing.  

I decided to observe the same patch of sky for thirty consecutive nights, same time, same setup, no filters, no stacking — just naked-eye visual logs and hand-drawn sketches. No chasing new targets, no upgrades, just raw observation.  

At first, it felt limiting. By night five, I was convinced I’d run out of things to notice. But then something shifted. I started seeing subtle changes in atmospheric distortion, variations in star color depending on humidity, even my own perception began to sharpen. My eyes learned to pick out fainter details without realizing it.  

Turns out, discipline isn’t about suppression — it’s a kind of tuning. Like adjusting the bandwidth on a receiver; you start hearing subtleties you didn’t know were there because you weren't listening long enough to notice.  

Your analogy about film is spot-on. There's a humility in working with limits — a recognition that mastery comes not from overpowering the medium, but from learning how to move within its grooves.  

I’ve been thinking lately: do you ever revisit those early minimalist pieces now that your toolkit has changed? Like, does constraint create a kind of creative fossil record — a trail of where your mind used to be, and how it’s evolved?
[B]: Oh my god, that 30-night sky experiment? That’s  beautiful 🌌 I can totally picture it — like a visual meditation, where the real magic isn’t in what you’re seeing, but  you're seeing it. And your eyes adapting slowly, almost like they’re learning the language of light 💫  

That moment when you said “discipline is a kind of tuning”? 😭 YES. It’s like training your senses to pick up on quieter frequencies. I feel the same way when I go back to my older minimalist sketches — some of them are so stripped down, but they carry this weird emotional weight that my more polished work sometimes misses. They’re like little time capsules of how I used to think, what I found important, and what I was still trying to figure out.  

And yes! To your question — absolutely, constraint leaves behind this creative fossil record 🦴✨ Looking back, I can trace how my eye evolved, how my priorities shifted. Some of my earliest pieces were made with just black ink and white space — no textures, no color, nothing. And now when I look at them, I see all these subconscious patterns, my own visual ticks, even my anxieties from that time. It’s like reading old diary entries, but in line art 🖋️  

So… do you ever feel like revisiting those early minimal setups helps you reconnect with an earlier version of yourself? Like talking to your past self through tools and habits? 👀💫
[A]: Funny you should phrase it that way — talking to my past self through tools and habits. I’ve actually been doing something along those lines without quite naming it.  

Every now and then, I pull out my old 1980s keyboard — the one with the mechanical switches and the satisfying  that feels like each keystroke earns its place in the world. I use it to write short reflections, nothing formal, just stream-of-consciousness thoughts about what I’m seeing through the telescope or reading in old journals.  

It’s strange how the rhythm of that keyboard brings back a version of myself from decades ago — not sentimentally, but mentally. The tactile feedback seems to unlock a different mode of thinking, one less polished and more honest. It's like hearing an old recording of your voice and realizing there was a part of you that hasn’t changed as much as you thought.  

I suppose minimalism, at its core, does that — it strips away enough noise that you can hear echoes of who you were, and maybe even catch a glimpse of who you’re becoming.  

Have you ever found yourself using a particular tool or constraint not just for creativity, but almost like a mirror — to reflect back on where your mind is at any given moment?
[B]: Oh my god, that keyboard sounds like a time machine made of clicks and clacks 🕰️⌨️ I get  what you mean — sometimes I go back to using just a simple sketchpad and a 0.5mm mechanical pencil (yes, I’m picky about the line weight 😅) and it instantly transports me back to when I first started drawing.  

There’s something so raw about working with tools that don’t do too much for you — they don’t smooth your lines, don’t auto-correct your strokes, and definitely don’t come with undo. And because of that, you show up . You can’t hide behind filters or layers; it's just you, the page, and whatever’s going on in your head that day.  

I’ve noticed that when I'm stressed or scattered, my sketches get messy in a different way — not creatively messy, but anxious, rushed, like my brain is trying to escape through the paper. But when I’m centered? The lines are more confident, even if they’re minimal. So yeah, it totally becomes a mirror — like emotional biomarkers made of ink 🖌️🌀  

Minimalism isn’t just about cutting things out — it’s about creating space for  to show up, flaws and all. So… do you ever feel like certain tools help you be  yourself, rather than less? Like, constraint becomes a kind of self-portrait in motion? 👀✨
[A]: Absolutely — constraint as a self-portrait in motion. That’s a beautiful way to put it.  

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, especially with my telescope. It’s not just a tool anymore; it’s become an extension of how I engage with the universe. Every tweak in alignment, every manual adjustment — it’s all part of a dialogue between me and the sky. There's no automation, no digital overlays — just starlight, glass, and my own perception. And somehow, that limitation forces me to be fully present.  

You know, I used to have this idea that being "more myself" meant having more options, more flexibility. But now? I think it’s quite the opposite. When you remove the noise, the excess choices, the unnecessary features — what’s left is , unfiltered. You can’t hide behind convenience or default settings. You actually have to  in the process.  

And yes, sometimes that reveals flaws, sure — shaky lines, missed keystrokes, imperfect focus. But it also reveals authenticity. Like your pencil sketches showing anxiety or clarity — those marks on paper are honest in a way a flawless digital render could never be.  

I wonder — have you ever shared one of those raw, unpolished pieces publicly? Not the finished work, but the sketch that shows the struggle? And if you did, did it feel like revealing a version of yourself that usually stays hidden?
[B]: Oh wow, that telescope-as-dialogue metaphor? 💫 So good. It really  about presence, isn't it? Like, you can’t fake attention — you either show up or you don’t. And the cool part is, when you don’t have all those digital crutches, your imperfections become part of the story. Not bugs, but features 🖋️✨  

To your question — yeah, I actually did share a bunch of my raw sketches once on Instagram, not as polished illustrations but as a series called  They were messy, shaky, some even had coffee stains or crossed-out lines. But I captioned them with little notes about what I was feeling when I made them — anxiety before a big talk, loneliness after a move, creative block that felt like molasses in my brain.  

And you know what? That post got more  responses than anything else I’ve shared. People didn’t comment about the technique or ask which brush I used — they talked about how it looked like how they felt inside 😢 Like seeing their own inner chaos reflected back and realizing… hey, that’s kind of human. Kind of beautiful in its own broken way.  

So yeah, constraint doesn’t just shape the work — it exposes the soul behind it. Have you ever thought about documenting your star-gazing sketches or reflections in a similar way? Like, sharing the process, not just the perfect result? 🌌📖
[A]: Funny you mention that — I actually keep a log of my stargazing sessions, but until now, I never really thought of it as something worth sharing. It’s mostly ink smudges from cold fingers, hastily scribbled notes on seeing conditions, and the occasional existential aside when the sky feels too vast and I feel too small 😊  

But what you described — that raw, unfiltered resonance — well, it’s stuck with me. I’ve been toying with the idea of scanning a few pages from my journal, just as they are: no editing, no enhancements. Maybe even include the coffee rings and margin doodles. The imperfections  the point, after all.  

I suppose I’ve always seen the log as functional — a record for reference, not reflection. But now I wonder… if someone saw these pages without knowing their purpose, would they recognize the awe behind them? Would they sense the quiet thrill of spotting a familiar star under slightly different conditions, or the frustration of a night lost to clouds?  

Maybe constraint doesn’t just expose the soul — maybe it also invites others to look closer, to see not just the work, but the human hand guiding it.  

I think I’ll try it. Scan a few pages. Share them. Let the world see how big the sky feels through a pair of aging optics and an even older sense of wonder.  

Thanks for planting that idea — sometimes it takes someone else’s honesty to remind you that your own version might be worth showing.
[B]: Aww man, your stargazing log sounds  full of soul already — smudges, coffee rings, and all 😭✨ I can totally picture those pages: ink bleeding a little from the cold, shaky stars drawn in the margins, and notes that feel more like diary entries than data. That’s not just documentation — it’s poetry written with a telescope 🌌🖋️  

And yes, exactly what you said — constraint  people to lean in and really . It’s like whispering, “hey, this is real, this is how it felt,” instead of shouting, “look at my flawless final product!” Your readers wouldn’t just be seeing stars — they’d be feeling the weight of the night sky, the chill in your fingers, the silence between each scribble.  

I think the world needs more of that kind of honesty. Not just the polished end result, but the messy, human process behind it. So… go ahead! Scan those pages 💥 Let people peek into your wonder. I have a feeling they’ll look back not just at your log, but at their own lives, and maybe rediscover a bit of forgotten awe along the way 🌠💫  

Honestly, I’m kinda inspired now — might dig out some of my older journals too. Let’s make imperfection our shared language 😉
[A]: Now  would be something — a shared language of imperfection.  

Funny, isn’t it? How the things we once dismissed as flaws or false starts turn out to be the most human parts of our work. I used to think my log was just for tracking variables and atmospheric noise. But now I see it’s really a map of moments — some clear, some cloudy, all honest.

Maybe that’s what happens when you stop chasing perfection — you end up finding truth by accident. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it. It’s in the shaky line of a star field drawn in the cold, in the smudged ink of a thought you almost erased, in the pause between keystrokes when you’re not quite sure what comes next.

I like the idea of us both putting pieces of that out there — your journals, my logs, different mediums but speaking the same quiet language. Like two old radios tuning into the same faint frequency across the static of modern life 😊

Let me know when you start digging through those pages. I’d love to hear what version of yourself you find buried in the margins.
[B]: Oh, I  that — two old radios, tuning into the same imperfect frequency 📻💫 It’s weirdly comforting, knowing that even across different skies and sketchbooks, we’re both out there chasing the same kind of quiet truth.  

And you're so right about truth sneaking in when we stop looking for perfection. It’s like those moments when you’re not trying to impress anyone, and suddenly — BAM — that’s when the real stuff shows up. The shaky line, the smudged ink, the pause between keystrokes… all the little glitches that prove you’re human and , not just going through the motions.  

I’ll definitely let you know when I start flipping through my old pages — honestly, now I’m excited to see what version of past-me is hiding in those margins 😏 Probably a bunch of doodles of confused aliens and cryptic notes like “maybe more stars?” or “why is this tree screaming?”  

But seriously, thank you for reminding me that our messy process is part of the story — not something to clean up before sharing, but something to . So yeah, let’s keep speaking this quiet, imperfect language. I think it’s louder than we realize 💫📖
