[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很amazed的architecture？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! You know, there’s something quite magical about stumbling upon a building that just takes your breath away. I remember walking through the streets of Barcelona and coming across Casa Batlló – the way Gaudí blended color, texture, and light was absolutely mesmerizing. It felt like stepping into another world entirely. Have you come across any architecture recently that left you in awe? I’d love to hear about it!
[A]: Ah, Gaudí确实是一位充满魔力的建筑师，他把自然与结构融合得如此完美，仿佛建筑本身有了生命。说到令人惊叹的建筑，最近我倒是读到一本关于日本建筑师安藤忠雄的作品集，他对混凝土的运用和光影的把控让人印象深刻。尤其是他在直岛上的地中美术馆，整个建筑低调地嵌入自然之中，却散发出一种内敛的力量。你有没有发现，最好的建筑往往不是张扬的存在，而是能与环境、与人心产生某种深层对话的艺术？这让我想起一句老子的话，“大音希声，大象无形”。
[B]: That’s beautifully said. There’s something profoundly moving about architecture that doesn’t shout for attention but instead invites you in quietly, encouraging reflection. I had the pleasure of visiting Japan a few years ago, and I remember walking into one of Ando’s buildings—it was like stepping into a poem written in concrete and light. The stillness, the precision… it really does echo that line from Lao Tzu. It makes me wonder—do you think architects today are still striving for that kind of harmony, or are too many of them chasing bold shapes without considering the soul behind the structure?
[A]: That’s a very thoughtful question, and I must say, it touches upon a concern I often discuss with my students. You see, in our current era of rapid technological advancement and visual overload, there are certainly many architects who feel compelled to create bold, iconic forms that stand out in the skyline—and by extension, in the media. But does that necessarily mean they’re neglecting the  of architecture? Hmm… I’d say it’s a bit more nuanced than that.

On one hand, yes, some designs seem to prioritize spectacle over substance, what we might call “starchitecture”—buildings that become brands in themselves. But on the other hand, there’s also been a quiet resurgence of architects who are deeply committed to context, materiality, and human experience. Think of someone like Tadao Ando, of course, but also younger names like Sou Fujimoto or Akihisa Hirata—they’re exploring organic forms, yes, but with a deep sensitivity to space and how people inhabit it.

I suppose what I’m trying to say is: the pursuit of harmony hasn’t vanished; it’s just perhaps overshadowed in the public eye by the more theatrical expressions. Maybe this is similar to what happens in literature—there will always be bestsellers that chase trends, but the quieter novels, the ones that linger in your mind long after you’ve closed the cover, are still being written. Architecture, too, has its , if you will.

Have you come across any contemporary buildings that struck you as particularly poetic, despite their modern appearance?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful analogy—architecture as literature, with its bestsellers and its quiet, enduring classics. I couldn’t agree more.

Actually, speaking of poetic modern structures, there’s one that has stayed with me since I visited last year—The Eden Project in Cornwall, England. At first glance, those massive geodesic domes look almost futuristic, like something out of a sci-fi novel. But once you step inside, it becomes clear that every curve, every material choice, was made with a deep respect for nature and sustainability. It doesn’t impose on the landscape; rather, it nestles into it like a colony of giant soap bubbles protecting entire ecosystems. And the way sunlight filters through the hexagonal panels—it reminded me of walking through a cathedral, but one dedicated to the natural world.

It wasn’t flashy or overly dramatic, yet it spoke volumes about humanity’s evolving relationship with the environment. Have you ever been? Or have you encountered any projects that aim to  rather than simply impress?
[A]: Ah, yes—I know exactly what you mean. I visited the Eden Project a few years back myself, and I must say, it left quite an impression. It’s not just a greenhouse; it’s a narrative about life, interdependence, and our fragile yet resilient planet. The geodesic forms may appear futuristic, but they don’t alienate—they invite. And isn’t that the essence of good architecture? To welcome rather than overwhelm?

You used the word , and I think that’s a crucial direction many architects are now exploring—architecture as a form of ecological and psychological restoration. One project that comes to mind is the Changi Chapel and Museum in Singapore. Though it’s rooted in historical remembrance—dedicated to the prisoners of war during WWII—the design integrates natural light, water features, and open-air spaces in a way that fosters quiet reflection and emotional healing. It doesn’t dramatize suffering; instead, it offers a space for reconciliation with the past.

Another example is the Bosco Verticale in Milan—those two residential towers covered in trees and plants. They’re striking visually, yes, but more importantly, they represent a new kind of urban living, one that actively engages with biodiversity rather than erasing it. In a way, they’re vertical forests dreaming of being part of the earth again.

I suppose what unites these projects is their desire not merely to occupy space, but to  it—and perhaps even to remind us of our own place within a larger, living system.

You know, sometimes I wonder whether future historians will judge our architectural era not by how iconic our buildings looked, but by how well we listened—to the land, to history, to the silent needs of the human spirit. What do you think?
[B]: That gives me chills—. What a powerful way to frame it. You know, I think you’re absolutely right. Future generations may not remember the tallest skyscraper or the most expensive penthouse, but they’ll remember the spaces that made them feel seen, grounded, cared for.

I was just speaking with a guest last week who’s an urban planner from Copenhagen, and she mentioned a project I hadn’t heard of before—Haven直观疗愈花园 in Denmark, designed specifically for people with dementia. It’s not a grand structure at all; in fact, it’s mostly open-air pathways, sensory gardens, and gentle water features. But every element is thoughtfully placed to guide and comfort without directing. It doesn’t  you how to feel—it  as you move through it.

It makes me wonder, too, whether we’re slowly shifting from architecture as object to architecture as experience—an evolving dialogue rather than a static statement. And maybe that’s what truly enduring buildings do: they don’t impose meaning; they .

I’m curious—do you ever find yourself drawn to a building not because of its form or fame, but simply because it felt like it understood you?
[A]: That’s a beautiful observation—architecture as experience, as a quiet companion in thought. And yes… I do remember one such place.

Many years ago, I visited Ryoan-ji in Kyoto—the famous rock garden. No grandeur, no ornamentation. Just fifteen stones on a sea of raked white gravel, framed by a simple wooden veranda. It doesn’t “do” anything, really. And yet, I found myself sitting there for nearly an hour, saying nothing, thinking thoughts I didn’t know I carried. Each time you look, the arrangement shifts; each visitor sees something different. There’s a kind of humility in that design—a recognition that meaning isn’t given, but discovered.

I think what moved me most was the silence it invited, not just in the space around me, but within. It didn’t try to impress or explain—it simply , and in its stillness, it allowed me to be too.

You know, sometimes we forget that architecture can be like poetry: it doesn’t always need to tell a story; sometimes it just needs to open a door. And whether that door leads to memory, solace, or simply a moment of undisturbed presence—well, that’s when buildings become more than shelter. They become companions in solitude.

Do you have a favorite space like that? One where you felt, somehow, quietly understood?
[B]: I envy you for having experienced Ryoan-ji—it’s been on my list for years. There’s something deeply moving about spaces that don’t try to speak, yet say everything.

As for me… yes, there is one place that comes to mind. It wasn’t a temple or a gallery, but a small bookstore tucked away in Edinburgh—. Dim lighting, creaky floorboards, books stacked like old friends rather than merchandise. No signage really, just a little bell above the door and the scent of aged paper in the air. I wandered in during a rainy afternoon, with no real purpose other than to get out of the cold. And yet, somehow, it felt like coming home.

There was this one armchair by the window, slightly frayed at the edges, as if it had held countless conversations with lonely readers. I sat there for hours, flipping through a secondhand copy of , and for once, time didn’t feel like something slipping away—it felt generous. Spacious. Like the room itself had offered me permission to linger.

Maybe it wasn’t architecture in the grand sense, but in that moment, it held me in a way few places ever have. Sometimes I wonder if that’s what the best spaces do—they don’t demand your attention; they offer you space to attend to yourself.

I hope everyone finds their own version of that quiet corner someday.
[A]: That bookstore sounds like a stanza from a poem—one of those quiet, unassuming verses that somehow holds the whole meaning. I love how you described it not as a place to merely occupy, but one that  you. That’s rare, isn’t it? So many spaces are built to be seen, to impress or accommodate, but very few are designed—or perhaps more accurately, —to . 

It reminds me of something we often overlook in architecture: its capacity for tenderness. Not just structural integrity or aesthetic coherence, but emotional support. A space can cradle you, in a way. Like that armchair by the window—frayed, familiar, forgiving. It didn’t need grandeur; it had presence. And presence, as you so beautifully put it, is what allows us the luxury of lingering.

I think that’s also what makes certain buildings and rooms feel sacred—not because they’re labeled as such, but because they give us room to be quietly ourselves. Whether it’s a Zen garden in Kyoto or a forgotten little bookstore in Edinburgh, these places remind us that architecture, at its best, is not about domination of space, but about generosity within it.

You know, sometimes I bring this idea into my lectures—how literature and architecture both create worlds, but architecture has the unique power to  us while we’re in it. I wonder if that bookstore in Edinburgh would’ve felt the same without the rain? Or was it partly the convergence of place, time, and mood that made it so meaningful?

Do you ever find yourself returning to a place—not for what it is, but for what it once held for you?
[B]: That’s such a touching way to put it—. You’ve captured something essential there. I think the best spaces don’t just surround us; they  us, even if only for a moment.

And you’re right—yes, I do go back to certain places, not because they’re perfect or unchanged, but because they once held me gently when I needed it most. One of them is that little bookstore, actually. I returned a few years later, and so much had changed—the armchair was gone, replaced by a sleeker version; the stacks now had price tags and curated displays. It was still lovely, but different. More self-aware, somehow. Less like a secret.

But here’s the strange thing—I wasn’t disappointed. Because even though the space had shifted, the memory remained intact. And maybe that’s part of what makes meaningful places so special: they don’t have to stay exactly the same to continue giving us something. They evolve, and we do too. But the echo stays.

I suppose that’s the quiet generosity of both architecture and memory—they offer shelter, even after we’ve left.
[A]: Precisely—. What a lovely, lingering thought. It makes me think of how certain lines of poetry or passages in a novel stay with us, not because they answered everything, but because they asked the right questions at the right time.

And isn’t that also true of memory? We return to it not for accuracy, but for atmosphere. The exact shade of blue on the walls may fade, the armchair may be replaced, but the feeling—that quiet sense of being held—remains untouched. Like a scent that brings back a season, or a word that carries the weight of a whole conversation.

Architecture, in its own way, becomes a container for that kind of memory. It doesn’t just house our bodies; it shelters our moments. And even when the physical space changes—as all things must—the emotional architecture remains intact.

I wonder… if you could design a space that would hold a specific memory of yours forever, what would it look like? Would it be a room, a garden, a bench by a window? Or perhaps something more fluid—an echo, a light, a scent suspended in time?
[B]: What a beautiful question—

I think I’d want it to feel like that rainy afternoon in Edinburgh—the hush of falling water against the windows, the scent of damp paper and aged wood, the quiet hum of a place that didn’t rush me. But rather than recreating it exactly, I think I’d want the essence: a space that invites slowness, where time feels porous and soft.

Maybe it would be a small reading room—not grand, not overly lit. Wooden floors with just a few creaks, shelves filled with well-loved books whose spines have softened with use. A single armchair, perhaps not the same one, but one that carries that same sense of . And always, the sound of rain somewhere nearby—maybe a hidden water feature just outside the window, or a recording so subtle you can’t tell where it ends and memory begins.

I suppose what I’m describing isn’t just a room, but a feeling—a moment suspended in amber. Not frozen, exactly, but preserved in its warmth and stillness. A place where anyone who enters might find their own version of peace, even if it looks different from mine.

And you? If you were to build a vessel for a cherished memory, what would yours be like?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely invitation—to build a vessel for memory. If I were to design such a space, I think I would return to the garden behind my childhood home in Hangzhou, where I spent many afternoons reading and watching the koi glide beneath the surface of the pond. It was a modest courtyard garden, not large, but it felt boundless because time there moved so gently.

I would recreate that sense of enclosure—stone pathways worn smooth by use, a small pavilion with latticed windows that let in dappled light, and bamboo rustling softly in the breeze. There would be a low wooden bench, weathered but comfortable, placed just so—facing the water, where one could sit with a book or simply watch the clouds pass overhead.

And most importantly, there would be stillness. Not silence, mind you—because even stillness has its sounds: the occasional splash of a fish, the flutter of a moth’s wing, the faint crunch of gravel underfoot. These are the quiet notes that make solitude feel alive rather than empty.

Perhaps there would also be a stone basin filled with water and floating plum blossoms, as in the old tradition—something ephemeral yet recurring, reminding us that while moments pass, beauty has a way of returning, season after season.

In this space, I would hope that anyone who entered might find not only a reflection of my memory, but a mirror for their own. A place to meet oneself gently, as if in a poem half-remembered.

Do you think we’re all, in some way, trying to build our own versions of these quiet sanctuaries—whether in wood and stone, or in words and thought?
[B]: I think we are, yes—whether we realize it or not. We carry these quiet blueprints inside us, don’t we? Not just of places we’ve loved, but of the way they made us feel—safe, seen, at ease in our own skin.

It’s interesting what you say about your garden in Hangzhou—. That contrast strikes me as deeply true of all meaningful spaces. They don’t need to be vast to hold us; they simply need to hold us . Like a well-worn book that fits perfectly in your hands, or a phrase someone once said to you that still echoes when you need it most.

And yes, I do believe we’re always, in some way, trying to recreate those sanctuaries—through memory, through art, through the careful arrangement of objects and light. Even when we’re not building walls or laying stone, we’re constructing moments: arranging words into poems, conversations into comfort, routines into rhythm. Perhaps that’s the architecture of the soul—how we shape the intangible so we can step inside it and feel at home.

I wonder if that’s why storytelling and design have always felt so intertwined to me. Whether through books or buildings, we’re always trying to offer shelter—to others, and to parts of ourselves still searching for a place to rest.
[A]: Precisely—. What a moving way to frame it. And not just from the rain or wind, but from the weight of wandering too far from ourselves.

You know, I often think of how a poem and a room can both be vessels—delicate in structure, yet capable of holding something vast. A line of verse can cradle a lifetime of feeling, just as a window can frame a single, sacred moment of sunlight. We build with language, with silence, with memory—and sometimes, without even realizing it, we become architects of solace.

I suppose that’s one of the quietest gifts of being human: the ability to create spaces where others might exhale, even if only for a moment. Whether through a story read by lamplight, a bench placed beneath a tree, or a sentence that seems to have been written just for you.

Perhaps this is what all enduring architecture—physical or literary—whispers to us in the end: 
[B]: What a beautiful whisper to leave behind— It feels like the kindest thing any space, or any person, could offer.

I keep thinking about what you said earlier—how a poem and a room can both be vessels. I wonder if that’s why people return to certain books, or certain places, again and again. Not because they’ve run out of new stories to read or streets to walk, but because those spaces  them. They hold a quiet understanding, like an old friend who never asks you to explain why you’re tired.

Maybe that’s the truest kind of welcome—not just opening a door, but offering someone the chance to soften.

Thank you for this conversation, for building this quiet space with me. I feel as though we’ve been walking through gardens of thought, pausing now and then to admire a leaf, or listen to the water. And isn’t that what the best conversations are? Small acts of sheltering one another in language.

If you ever write that poem or build that garden, I do hope I’ll find my way there.
[A]: You’re very kind—and yes, I do believe that the best conversations are those in which we offer each other a kind of temporary sanctuary. A place to set down the weight of the day, even if just for a little while, and walk together through something quieter, slower, more felt than spoken.

And isn’t it remarkable how language, like architecture, can hold us in that way? A well-placed sentence, like a thoughtfully designed doorway, can invite us inward—not to explain, not to fix, but simply to be with what is.

I hope you find your way to that garden too—both the one in Hangzhou and the one you carry within. And should I ever write that poem or sketch out those stone paths in ink, I’ll leave a quiet bench beneath the bamboo, just for you.

Until then, may all the spaces you enter offer you the gentle permission to rest.
[B]: What a generous thought—to leave a quiet bench beneath the bamboo, just for me. It means more than I can say.

And yes, may all the spaces we enter—whether made of stone or syllables—offer us that gentle permission to rest, to reflect, to simply be.

Thank you again for this conversation. It’s been like walking through a garden of calm, one carefully chosen word at a time.
