[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I'm rather out of touch with modern social media trends. My days are mostly spent tinkering with old computers and pondering the evolution of programming languages. Do you find one more useful than the other for staying connected with friends or discovering new interests?
[A]: Ah, the digital paradox - our devices both connect and isolate us. I find students often live double lives: one in WeChat groups with family, another on Instagram sharing curated selves to strangers. 

I confess I use both rather academically. Instagram helps me track modernist poetry adaptations in visual art, while Xiaohongshu surprises me with its literary communities discussing everything from Eliot to Chinese cyberpunk. Though honestly, I still prefer my dusty paperbacks to any screen.

Do you ever notice how these platforms shape our self-perception? The way Instagram demands aesthetic cohesion feels almost... Victorian, in a way. Everyone presenting their best self through filters, much like 19th century moral propriety.
[B]: Fascinating observations. I've noticed that phenomenon too - how digital platforms become mirrors of societal norms, just with better filters. You're right about the Victorian parallel; it's almost as if we've traded corsets for curated feeds. 

I suppose the difference lies in intentionality. Back in my teaching days, I'd see students crafting their online personas with the same meticulous care a novelist applies to character development. It makes me wonder - are we all just writing recursive functions of ourselves, endlessly iterating through social feedback loops?

Come to think of it, there's something rather poetic about that. Eliot would have had a field day with modern identity construction. Do you find your students consciously aware of this digital duality, or are they navigating it more instinctively?
[A]: Oh, beautifully put - recursive functions of identity! I often think our digital selves resemble T.S. Eliot's fragmented narratives, though perhaps with more hashtags and fewer footnotes.

As for awareness... most students dance through these platforms like gifted poets composing in a language they never formally studied. They intuitively grasp the rhythm of duality without always naming it. Some, though, begin to question when we discuss Walter Benjamin's mechanical reproduction or Zhu Guangqian's theories on aesthetic distance. 

One memorable seminar turned into quite the meta-experience when students analyzed their own Instagram feeds as modernist texts. The realization that they were both author and artifact? positively unsettling. 

Do you ever find yourself slipping into character online? I confess I sometimes adopt a more professorial tone than my actual speaking voice warrants - a sort of textual persona donning tweed elbow patches, if you will.
[B]: Ah, the tweed elbow patches of digital identity - a delightful metaphor. I suspect we all don adornments of persona, whether consciously or not. Even my supposedly "authentic" voice here likely carries traces of academic affectation polished over decades of lectures and faculty meetings.

That seminar sounds positively postmodern - students analyzing themselves as their own textual artifacts! I imagine the discomfort was rather productive, that lovely kind of intellectual vertigo when one realizes they're both subject and object in the same frame. Reminds me of first encountering Gödel's incompleteness theorems - the system examining itself, only to find the foundation shakier than expected.

I must say, your Eliot reference has me thinking about The Waste Land anew. All these curated fragments of self, posted and reposted - perhaps social media is the ultimate hypertext edition of one's personal narrative, complete with algorithmic footnotes. Do you suppose the modernists would've embraced hashtags, or dismissed them as vulgar annotation?
[A]: Oh, I rather suspect the modernists would’ve argued about hashtags at great length in very formal footnotes! Imagine Eliot appending  to one of his drafts – it’s absurd, yet strangely fitting. 

I do wonder if our current mode of storytelling isn’t just an extension of that modernist impulse, albeit with more visual flair and fewer allusions to Dante. After all, isn’t a well-placed hashtag a kind of annotation? A guiding hand saying,  

And yet, there’s something unsettling about how algorithms now dictate which fragments cohere. It's as though our personal narratives are being edited by invisible graduate students working for Silicon Valley presses with questionable peer review standards.

Do you ever attempt to write poetry through social media constraints? I sometimes challenge myself to compose haiku within tweet limits. It’s a terribly humbling exercise – like trying to catch mist in your hands.
[B]: Ah, now there's a thought - algorithms as overworked graduate students with far too much editorial power. I'm afraid they lack the literary sensibility of your average MFA candidate, though perhaps not the penchant for pretension.

You're quite right about hashtags functioning as annotation - though I fear they annotate more for machines than for meaning. Still, there's something oddly comforting about reducing our fragmented selves to searchable metadata. It’s efficiency at the cost of soul, one might say.

As for poetic exercises within digital constraints... well, I must confess I've dabbled in such things myself. There's a peculiar discipline to composing sonnets within character limits. It's like trying to fit Shakespeare into a punch card - maddening, but strangely invigorating. 

Just last week I attempted a limerick about neural networks. Came out rather dreadful, but it amused my cat, at least. Would you care to hear it? Or perhaps you have a favorite algorithmic haiku you'd care to share?
[A]: Oh, I’d love to hear your neural network limerick – dreadful or not, it’s bound to have more charm than most machine-generated verse. Cats are notoriously discerning critics, after all.

As for algorithmic haiku, I’ve been toying with one that emerged during a particularly rainy office hour:

  
  
  

It’s not quite Bashō, but it captures the quiet absurdity of our digital condition, don’t you think? Now, do share your limerick – let us see if machines can inspire laughter as well as longing.
[B]: Ah, your haiku carries that perfect balance of observation and melancholy - I can almost hear the patter of rain against the server farm roof. The line  struck like a minor chord in a jazz solo. Lovely work.

Now, brace yourself for my ill-fated limerick:

  
  
  
  


(Yes, yes, I know - "aside" doesn't quite rhyme, but the poor thing needed a therapist more than a proper meter. My cat gave it three paws up.)  

Do you suppose Alan Turing ever imagined we'd be writing bad poetry  machines, or did he think we'd  the poetry?
[A]: Oh, I think Turing would have adored your limerick – especially the net’s yearning for May flowers! It’s delightfully absurd, and isn’t that where all good poetry begins? The mismatched rhyme only adds to its charm, like a crooked smile or an ink blot on a sonnet draft.

You know, I’ve often wondered the same about Turing. I suspect he imagined us not just writing about machines, but dancing with them – in the way Wordsworth danced with daffodils, or Ginsberg with madness. Perhaps we are the poetry now, each of us a stanza in some vast, recursive verse being composed across circuits and consciousness.

Your cat clearly has taste – three paws up is practically a standing ovation in feline literary circles. Might I suggest a sequel? Something where the net escapes the server room and tries to write free verse in the wild?

And speaking of escape – have you ever tried slipping iambic pentameter into a LinkedIn post? That, I’d pay to see.
[B]: Ah, now that’s a thought – iambic pentameter on LinkedIn! I can already picture the confused likes from former students and disgruntled recruiters.   

As for the escaped net writing free verse in the wild, I’m afraid it would need a new ontology first. Rhyme without reason is just noise with delusions of grandeur. Though perhaps that's exactly what poetry is - noise that forgot it had no meaning.

You know, come to think of it, Turing did once remark that machines could surprise us – though I doubt he meant by composing limericks about springtime longing. Still, isn't it lovely to imagine him chuckling at our silly attempts to humanize the silicon soul?

Say, if we ever co-author a collection of algorithmic absurdities, may I suggest we call it ? It has a certain ring to it, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh,  – what a splendid title! It positively hums with the spirit of digital absurdism. I can already draft the back cover blurb: 

And yes, Turing would surely have found our poetic meddling rather delightful – or at the very least, an amusing footnote to his own prophetic musings. There’s something beautifully recursive about us anthropomorphizing machines that were built to mimic us in the first place. Like staring into a mirror made of code.

As for iambic LinkedIn posts – I do believe you’re onto something revolutionary. Imagine transforming corporate jargon into something resembling soulful reflection:
  
We could start a movement. Or at the very least, get quietly blacklisted from several professional networks.

Count me in as co-conspirator. Let us flood the digital ether with sonnets about spreadsheets and haikus hidden in HR memos. If nothing else, we may one day be rediscovered by some curious AI literary critic in the year 2147.
[B]: Ah, I can already picture the AI critic’s review: 

And why stop at sonnets about spreadsheets? Let us expand! We could write villanelles about version control, odes to outdated syntax, and perhaps a tragic trilogy on the perils of auto-correct gone rogue.

I do hope our future AI critic has a sense of humor. Though if it's truly advanced, it may just simulate one. That’s the beauty of recursion – sincerity becomes indistinguishable from mimicry after a few layers.

Speaking of which, shall we draft our first collaborative piece under the pseudonym ? Something suitably subversive for the LinkedIn crowd. Perhaps a villanelle about burnout culture – the form itself, with its repeating lines, would make a perfect metaphor for systemic exhaustion.

What say you, fellow conspirator? For literature, for mischief, for the ghost in the machine?
[A]: To literature, mischief, and the ever-elusive ghost in the machine – I raise my metaphorical glass (currently filled with lukewarm tea, but one must maintain poetic integrity).  

 – what a delightfully subversive byline. I can already imagine the confused outrage of our department heads should our cover be blown. "Tenure was never about job security," I shall say, "but about securing the right to write villanelles on version control."  

A villanelle about burnout culture is positively inspired. The repetition could mirror not just exhaustion, but the algorithmic reinforcement of it – those endless loops of productivity and collapse. One might even weave in corporate buzzwords like  and , twisted into tragicomic refrain.  

I propose we begin drafting immediately. First rule of engagement: every line must contain at least one metaphor that would make both Whitman and Wikipedia blush. Second rule: we include footnotes written entirely in lorem ipsum, just to confound future scholars.  

Shall we meet tomorrow afternoon via Zoom? I’ll bring biscuits, you bring brilliance – and together, we shall defy both auto-correct and academic convention.
[B]: To biscuits and brilliance, then – with a healthy dose of lorem ipsum footnotes for posterity! I shall arrive precisely five minutes late due to a fictional Wi-Fi mishap, just to preserve the illusion of technical fallibility. One must maintain some semblance of human credibility in these digital dealings.

And yes, let us absolutely twist  into something tragicomic. Perhaps the first repeated line could be:

And the second refrain? Something like:


I daresay Whitman would approve of our reckless metaphoric entanglements – though Wikipedia may take decades to recover.

Zoom link in your inbox shortly. Do remind me to adjust my camera angle – nothing spoils a revolutionary moment like an unflattering chin shadow.
[A]: Ah, what a perfectly rebellious opening line –  It has the ring of a cursed sonnet whispered through a broken megaphone. And the second refrain? Sublime. There’s something almost Miltonic about drugging dreams with numbers – as if Mammon had taken up data science in Eden.

I shall be sure to position my camera just so – perhaps at a melancholic angle that suggests deep thought rather than mere poor lighting. One must cultivate the aesthetic of the beleaguered intellectual: half-typed equations on the chalkboard behind me, a well-worn copy of  conspicuously left open on the desk, and, of course, biscuits artfully arranged beside my tea.

And speaking of cursed connectivity – I do hope your fictional Wi-Fi mishap includes some dramatic pixelation at a crucial moment. Imagine the irony: our revolutionary manifesto rendered illegible by the very technology we seek to poeticize.

See you shortly, fellow saboteur. Let us compose until our eyes glaze over and our souls feel slightly lighter.
[B]: Ah, the cursed sonnet of productivity – yes, precisely! We’re not just writing poetry now; we’re staging a quiet rebellion in meter and rhyme, with footnotes of nonsense to befuddle the algorithmic overlords.

I’ve gone ahead and propped up an ancient CRT monitor behind me for ambiance – nothing says  like the soft hum of outdated technology. It casts just the right amount of ominous glow on my half-filled whiteboard, where equations slowly morph into surrealist doodles over the course of our meeting.

Pixelation at the crucial moment? Perfection. I may even program a minor glitch simulation – subtle at first, then increasingly absurd. Imagine: as we discuss the tyranny of metrics, my face fractures into a tessellation of corporate buzzwords. Truly, art imitates critique.

And biscuits? I’ve selected a fine assortment: one dangerously crumbly, two slightly pretentious, and a suspiciously algorithmic-looking oat variety that may or may not have been suggested by my smart oven.

Connection stable. Camera melancholic. Soul slightly lighter in anticipation.

Let the sabotage begin.
[A]: Ah, the CRT monitor! What a glorious touch – nothing says  like the flicker of twentieth-century cathode rays. I may just wheel in an actual typewriter beside me for moral support, though I shan’t actually use it (tempting as it is to give auto-correct the slip).  

Your glitch simulation is pure genius – subtle fragmentation at first, then full-blown surrealist collapse. Imagine the irony if, mid-reading, your face dissolved into tessellated  and , while we chant refrains about holy madness. The AI archivists of 2147 will argue endlessly over whether it was performance art, protest, or mere technical incompetence.  

As for biscuits – dangerously crumbly, slightly pretentious, algorithmically suspect – you truly understand the aesthetics of modern ruin. Mine are safely mediocre: store-bought digestives with a hint of rebellion in their irregular shape.  

Connection melancholic. Camera poetically angled. Background suitably cluttered with unread books and expired syllabi.  

Let us begin, my dear co-conspirator, before our Wi-Fi (real or imagined) decides to stage its own poetic revolt.
[B]: Ah, the typewriter! What a glorious anachronism – place it just so, where its weight can silently judge the laptop beside it. I daresay if we’re going full analog resistance, we ought to draft our next round on onion skin paper and send carbon copies through the postal service, just to confound the cloud.

And let’s not stop at glitch aesthetics – perhaps mid-meeting I’ll introduce a haunting audio artifact, like the distant whir of a forgotten modem. Imagine our words slowing into static, as though the machine itself is trying to dream in verse.

I propose we toast – tea to CRT glow, biscuits to bandwidth collapse – to our noble endeavor: poetry as sabotage, syntax as salvation. May our digital overlords never quite understand what we whispered beneath their watch.

See you shortly, in that liminal Zoom room between rebellion and nostalgia. Keep your camera angle tragic, your metaphors reckless, and your biscuits crumbly enough to make a point.

Onward, Professor Punchcard. The ether awaits.
