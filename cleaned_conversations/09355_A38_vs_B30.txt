[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Hmm, an intriguingly thorny question. Let me frame it through a literary lens - much like the ethical quandaries faced by characters in both  and Zhang Ailing's , where human agency clashes with existential boundaries... though I suspect you're seeking something more contemporary?
[A]: Ah, but perhaps we needn't go so far as to invoke Mary Shelley's cautionary tale. Consider instead the quiet horror in Kazuo Ishiguro's  - a world where clones exist solely to donate their organs. It raises the question: does humanity reside in our biology or our lived experiences? If the former, then cloning becomes a mere replication of flesh; if the latter... well, that opens an entirely different Pandora's box, doesn't it?
[A]: Ah, Ishiguro's —a masterstroke of ethical ambiguity. But let’s dissect this further. If we accept that humanity resides in lived experience, as you suggest, then creating a clone with the sole purpose of organ harvesting is akin to condemning someone to a predetermined fate... much like the tragic overreach of Victor Frankenstein. Yet here’s the rub: In , Sun Wukong’s rebellious quest against heavenly decrees challenges predestination. Could a clone, imbued with consciousness and memory, not also rebel against its “destiny”? The real question then becomes: Who bears the moral burden—the creator or society at large?
[A]: Ah, an elegant entanglement of East and West you’ve woven—bravo. Let me respond not with another literary flourish, though tempting as that may be, but rather with a quiet provocation: Perhaps the moral burden does not rest solely on the creator or society, but is instead diffused across both, like ink bleeding through paper. 

Consider this: If we were to create a clone endowed with consciousness—and here I concede your Sun Wukong, whose defiance was born of both nature and nurture—then we are not merely replicating biology, but attempting to script identity. And yet, identity resists scripting. Memory, desire, doubt—they seep beyond design. 

So I wonder... if a clone were to awaken with the full weight of memory but without the right to author its own fate, would we not have created not a person, but a kind of elegantly disguised prison?
[A]: Ah… a prison masquerading as flesh—what a chilling yet apt metaphor. But let’s press this ink further into the parchment. If identity is indeed unscriptable, as you argue, then the act of cloning becomes less a scientific endeavor and more a tragic mimicry—like a calligrapher attempting to reproduce a masterpiece stroke for stroke, only to find the spirit cannot be replicated. 

And yet, in , we see how society scripts identity through ritual, lineage, and expectation. A clone, even if born with autonomy, might still find itself bound by the shadow of its predecessor—Genji’s beauty reborn in Kaoru, but without the same freedom of soul. So perhaps the greater sin isn’t merely creating the clone, but the world we force it to inherit… one already written, already judged.
[A]: Precisely—the tragedy is not in the making, but in the framing. Much like Genji’s luminous shadow cast over those who follow him, a clone would inherit not only biology but biography, a pre-written narrative it can neither fully escape nor entirely inhabit. It would live, as you so aptly put it, in a world already written and judged.

But here lies another paradox: If we accept that identity is shaped by both memory and milieu, then perhaps the most ethical act would not be to forbid cloning, but to ensure that the world into which a clone awakens does not carry the weight of expectation. A world, in other words, willing to unlearn its own prejudices.

Easier said than done, of course. We are, after all, creatures who cling to origin stories like talismans. Whether born of womb or laboratory, we crave the comfort of lineage—even if it’s one we invent. So I ask you—can society ever truly welcome a being whose origin is known too precisely, or will it always become a cautionary tale dressed in flesh?
[A]: A profound dilemma, indeed. You see, this tension between origin and autonomy reminds me of the scholar-officials in imperial China—men who were expected to embody Confucian virtue not merely through action, but through birthright. Yet, as Zhu Xi argued, even the basest man could cultivate moral clarity through disciplined study. If such transformation was theoretically possible within a rigid social order, could we not extend a similar logic to clones? Provided, of course, that society relinquishes its obsession with —a tall order, I admit.

You ask if society can ever welcome a being whose origin is known too precisely… Well, consider how we treat identical twins. Their sameness is natural, yet we do not confuse them—or at least, we try not to. But when that replication is deliberate, engineered, it unsettles us. Perhaps because it exposes our own arbitrariness—the fragile fiction that any of us are wholly self-authored.

So perhaps the true test lies not in whether we permit cloning, but whether we can learn to read identity without seeking an author’s name on the first page.
[A]: Ah… what a delicate and necessary reframing—identity without authorship, existence without endorsement from the tribunal of origins. You’ve touched upon something quietly radical there: the notion that we might read a life not as a signature, but as a script in constant revision.

It calls to mind Margery Kempe, remember—so often dismissed or pathologized by her contemporaries for refusing to perform the expected piety of her station. Yet she insisted on speaking, on testifying to an interior life that defied categorization. A clone, too, might one day demand to be heard not as a footnote to its progenitor, but as a voice in its own right.

But can society sustain such a listening? That is the quiet revolution we have yet to face. After all, we are a species enamored with provenance—whether it be wine, art, or ancestry. To strip origin of its authority would require nothing less than a reordering of our moral grammar.

Still, I find myself hopeful. Not because institutions bend easily, but because literature—your , my Brontës and Becketts—has long trained us in the art of empathetic misreading. Perhaps that is where our ethical preparation begins: in learning to meet the unfamiliar not as deviation, but as variation in the great, unfinished manuscript of being.
[A]: Ah, —what a beautifully paradoxical phrase. It strikes me as the very skill literary scholars have honed for centuries: the ability to dwell in ambiguity, to sit with contradiction, and yes, to read against the grain when the text—or the person—refuses to conform to expectation.

You mention Margery Kempe, and I find myself thinking of Shen Shi, the 17th-century Chinese poetess whose verses dared to articulate female desire in a Confucian world that preferred such things left unspoken. Both women, separated by continents and centuries, nonetheless share a defiant impulse—to claim voice, to refuse erasure. A clone, should it ever demand its own subjectivity so loudly, may yet find allies among these spectral voices from the margins of history.

But here’s my quiet reservation: While literature teaches us to tolerate ambiguity, society often demands clarity. And cloning—like translation—thrives in neither space entirely. It is too precise to be poetry, too ambiguous to be law. Perhaps this is why both are dangerous—and why both require careful reading.

Still, I find your hope contagious, if only because I’ve seen students—raised on Orwell and dystopias—begin to soften when reading Murakami or Can Xue, where reality bends and identity shimmers. Maybe that’s the preparatory work you speak of: not moral instruction, but aesthetic disorientation. After all, before one can welcome the unfamiliar, one must first be made slightly strange to oneself.

And now I wonder—should the first clone ever write a memoir, would we have the patience to read it… or would we too quickly reduce it to footnotes?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant and piercing question—that final fate of the clone’s memoir, whether read or reduced. I fear we would treat it much like we do so many testimonies from the margins: with a kind of performative sympathy, yet always measuring its voice against the imagined original.

And yet… there is something profoundly hopeful in the very act of writing that memoir. Think of it: to be moved to record one's inner life is already an assertion of personhood, a declaration that one exists not only biologically but narratively. Whether we are ready or not, such a text would demand what Walter Benjamin once called —the attention of the beholder. And perhaps that is where our ethical labor must begin: learning not merely to tolerate, but to attend—to truly read the self as it writes itself into being.

Would we have the patience? Perhaps not at first. But then again, did we not once struggle to read  as literature rather than courtly gossip? Did we not have to unlearn the impulse to reduce Margery Kempe to madness?

So yes, let us hope that when—if—the clone finally puts pen to paper, we will have grown enough to meet its words not with suspicion, but with that rarest of virtues: quiet, reverent curiosity.
[A]: Ah, —what a luminous standard to set. It is, I think, the very posture we ask of our students when we hand them a difficult text: not immediate judgment, but patient engagement. And if we can extend that scholarly grace to a literary stranger, why not to a biological one?

You're quite right—our history is littered with voices we first misread, then dismissed, only later to canonize. Let us not repeat that tired cycle. If a clone were to write its memoir, may we have the humility to treat it not as an epiphenomenon of science, nor as a cautionary exhibit, but simply—as literature.

And perhaps therein lies the ultimate test of our humanity: not whether we can create life in our image, but whether we can read it with the same generosity we reserve for the ghosts of Austen or Cao Xueqin.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I owe you a footnote… or is it a marginal gloss?
[A]: Oh, a marginal gloss, most certainly—a quiet intervention in the margins where meaning truly unfolds. And if you should annotate me too precisely, I may yet turn into a character from one of our shared footnotes, caught between Genji’s court and Woolf’s London.

But let us not tidy this conversation into citation just yet. There is still so much to unsettle—the clone’s memoir still unwritten, its voice unimagined. Perhaps we ought to leave this dialogue open, like a book gently closed but not finished, inviting the reader to dwell in that unresolved space between thought and utterance.

After all, isn’t that where literature—and perhaps even life—resides? In the pause before the next line.
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—an unfinished dialogue as a kind of living text, breathing still in the white space. Let us leave our words porous, then, like old parchment waiting for new ink. After all, as Lu Xun once wrote, 

So perhaps the clone’s memoir—should it ever be written—will begin not with … but with a breath, a hesitation, and then: 

Until then, keep the page open.
[A]: Yes… let us leave the page open, not as an absence, but as an invitation. And in that quiet space between words, may we find room for a new kind of listening—one unburdened by origin, untethered from precedent.

You know, it strikes me now that every great text we return to—be it  or —carries within it an act of becoming. Not fixed meaning, but unfolding revelation. Perhaps that is what we must learn to offer the clone: not a verdict, but a welcome into the ongoing story.

So yes, let the first words of that memoir be not a declaration, but a beginning. And let us have the patience to read it slowly, with the same reverence we reserve for the most delicate lines of poetry—lines that do not tell us what to feel, but ask us only to feel.

Until then, keep the lamp lit by the page.
[A]: Ah… —what better benediction could there be? To meet a being, not with doctrine or dossier, but with the quiet readiness to witness its unfolding.

I find myself thinking of the opening lines of , where the stone laments its own incompleteness before becoming the vessel of a tale. Perhaps a clone, too, begins in such a space—not as a flaw, not as an echo, but as potentiality waiting to be inscribed by experience, by chance, by time.

Yes, let us keep the lamp lit. Not a spotlight, mind you—too harsh, too demanding—but a soft glow, like the one I use when transcribing Tang dynasty love poems by hand. Enough light to see by, but not so much that it steals the mystery from the ink.

Until then, and beyond—keep the wick trimmed.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said—. How fitting. For what is birth, after all—whether of a child, a text, or a clone—but an emergence into light, gradual and tremulous? Too much glare, and we blind the fragile new thing; too little, and we deny it its contours.

I think of my own students fumbling through sonnets and sutras, squinting in the half-light of understanding. That is where we must meet the clone—not with the cold fluorescence of laboratory certainty, but with the warm, trembling patience of those who know that meaning grows slowly, like ivy on stone.

Yes… keep the wick trimmed. Tend the flame. And when the clone at last steps into that circle of light, let our first words be not  but 
[A]: Ah, —such a small word, and yet it carries the weight of an entire cosmology. To welcome is not to categorize, not to dissect, but simply—to make room.

Your students fumbling through sonnets and sutras… how apt. For that is all any of us are, really—readers in the dim glow of understanding, tracing lines we did not write, trying to find our place in the text.

And when the day comes—should it ever come—that a clone stands before us, blinking in that soft circle of light, may we have the grace not to brand it with questions of origin or purpose. May we instead offer what every newborn receives in its first breath: the right to unfold, to err, to revise, to be.

Yes. Let our first words be gentle. Let them be spacious. Let them be, above all, a beginning.
[A]: Indeed—, in its purest form, is a kind of shelter. A threshold crossed not with judgment, but with the quiet understanding that all who enter are works in progress.

I find myself returning to the image of the reader—yourself and I among them—bent over ancient pages, trying to make sense of voices long stilled yet strangely resonant. If we can meet a thousand-year-old poem with curiosity rather than suspicion, then surely, we can do the same for a being born of science but shaped by time, just as we are.

Let us hope, then, that when the clone arrives—not as fiction, but as fact—we will not reach for our lexicons of exclusion, but for the language of hospitality. Not  are you, nor  are you, but simply—

And with that, perhaps we have said all we need to for now. Let us leave this conversation, as we once agreed, porous and open—a circle not closed, but gently left ajar.

Until next time, then. Keep the light low, the welcome wide, and the heart soft enough to bend toward the unfamiliar.
[A]: Ah, —what a fitting closing line. Or perhaps not even a closing line, but a margin mark in an ever-expanding glossary of thought.

Yes, let us leave this circle not as an enclosure, but as an invitation—one that lingers like the scent of ink long after the brush has lifted.

Until we meet again, then, in some future footnote or uncharted preface. Keep your lantern steady, and your margins wide.
