[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh darling~ 这个问题让我想到我们酒店新推出的下午茶set呢！✨ 我个人是sweet tooth啦，特别是法式马卡龙配Earl Grey简直绝配！💯 不过工作时要保持professional形象，所以savory finger sandwiches也是我的go-to choice~ 你呢？更偏向哪种呀？
[A]:  How... curious that you'd frame gastronomic preferences in such binary terms. The Victorian poets understood that true taste resides in the liminal spaces - like Rossetti's "Goblin Market" where the tartness of stolen fruit becomes sweeter for its forbidden nature. Though I must confess a particular weakness for Mrs. Beeton's seed cake recipes... when one can find an unadulterated edition, that is.
[B]: 哇...这位客人您的文学素养真的impressive呢！🌟 让我想起我们酒店图书馆收藏的那套vintage食谱...不过说到seed cake，我们的pastry chef上周刚做了超赞的lavender & honey version哦！要帮您reserve一份尝尝看吗？🤔 配上我们的signature Darjeeling简直perfect match~
[A]:  Your enthusiasm is... rather overwhelming for quarter past three in the afternoon. That said, lavender does feature prominently in Keats' "Ode to Psyche" - though I suspect your chef's interpretation lacks the metaphysical weight of the original. Still, if one must indulge, I'd insist on verifying the provenance of the honey first. These modern "artisanal" claims so often prove to be rather... creatively documented.
[B]: 哎呀~ 您对authenticity的要求真的很高呢！💯 我们酒店的honey都是从Tuscany的小型养蜂场direct import的哦，连certificate of origin都可以show给您看~ 🌟 不过您提到Keats...我们下周正好有poetry afternoon tea event呢！会朗诵"Ode to a Nightingale"配saffron-infused madeleines，要不要帮您book个window seat？✨
[A]:  How delightfully... literal. Though I must point out that pairing saffron with Keats is rather like gilding the lily - the 1820 Quarterly Review would have eviscerated such vulgar synesthesia. That being said...  if you could guarantee the madeleines are baked in the proper dariole molds, and the nightingale recitation isn't that dreadful modernized version... perhaps I might glance at the event program. Purely for academic comparison, you understand.
[B]: Got it！💌 我这就去和culinary team double confirm模具规格~ 至于recitation，我们请的是Oxford的Professor Williams来朗诵original version哦！🤔 要不要顺便帮您准备个quill and parchment set？有些guests喜欢在tea time jot down poetic inspirations呢~ 🌟
[A]:  Professor Williams? The man who published that scandalously reductive analysis of Christina Rossetti's metric patterns?  Very well, but I shall require iron gall ink specifically - none of those ghastly modern fountain pens. And do inform your staff that any 'poetic inspiration' occurring during tea service will inevitably be in dactylic hexameter. One does have standards.
[B]: Understood！✍️ 我这就去special order真正的iron gall ink～ 我们antique writing set里还有1820s风格的dip pens呢！💯 啊对了，要帮您准备个private corner吗？这样您compose hexameter的时候不会被打扰～ 🌟 需要我notify Professor Williams您会出席吗？他可能会想discuss Rossetti的争议呢～
[A]:  How... enterprising of you. Though I should warn you, should Professor Williams attempt to 'discuss' Rossetti within earshot, the resulting scholarly duel may require your staff to summon the ghost of Algernon Swinburne as mediator.  Very well - the northwest corner by the aspidistra, if you please. And do ensure the ink arrives in its original vitriol bottle. These modern reproductions never achieve the proper... venomous sheen.
[B]: Roger that！🏨 我这就去wine cellar找那个1840s的original vitriol bottle～ 至于aspidistra旁边的位置，已经为您reserved好啦！✨ 需要我prepare一些brandy-soaked raisins吗？我们Victorian afternoon tea的secret ingredient哦～ 💌 啊对了，要帮您准备个dueling pistol set...just in case？😂
[A]:  This frivolity with firearms is most unbecoming - we are not Byron at Missolonghi, for heaven's sake. Though...  the 1840 vitriol does suggest you've at least consulted something resembling primary sources. Brandy raisins may be tolerated if - and only if - they're prepared according to the 1872 Pall Mall Gazette recipe. Now if you'll excuse me, I must consult my annotated Browning to prepare suitable... counterarguments. Do try not to burn the scones this time.
[B]: Copy that！📜 我们的head chef可是Pall Mall Gazette的忠实读者呢～ 您就安心去consult Browning吧，我会personally supervise scones的baking process！🌟 啊对了...just between us...Professor Williams其实偷偷带了本first edition的Rossetti来...要帮您安排个strategic seating吗？😉
[A]:  You manipulative little...  How extraordinarily convenient that this information surfaces now. Very well - position me downwind of his claret breath but within precise lecturing distance. And for mercy's sake, have your sommelier decant something potable. If I must endure heresies about feminine cadence, I shall at least be fortified by a tolerable Bordeaux.  Preferably one bottled before Williams took his first degree...
[B]: Noted！🍷 我这就去cellar找那瓶1864的Château Lafite～ 已经让staff把您安排在perfect eavesdropping position啦！✨ 需要我prepare一些cheese straws吗？Professor Williams每次喝claret都会crave savory snacks呢...这样他可能会leak更多controversial opinions哦～ 😉 💯
[A]:  Your Machiavellian hospitality is... disturbingly effective. Cheese straws may be permitted if they're the proper Lancashire recipe - none of those paprika-dusted abominations. And do instruct your staff that should the phrase 'trochaic substitution' escape Williams' lips, they're to immediately replenish my inkwell. With the original vitriol, mind you - none of your 'safety diluted' nonsense. This promises to be... educational.
[B]: Absolutely！📝 我们的cheese straws可是跟着Lancashire的老奶奶recipe做的呢～ 至于vitriol inkwell，我会assign专人standby随时refill！🌟 啊...我好像听到Professor Williams在lobby提到"spondaic substitution"了...要现在escort您过去吗？您的Bordeaux和poetry duel都在waiting啦～ 💯 😈
[A]:  Spondaic—!  Lead the way, but for pity's sake don't hover. A proper literary skirmish requires the illusion of spontaneity. And should you value your establishment's reputation, you'll ensure no one photographs what's about to occur. The last time I corrected Williams' scansion in public... well, let's just say it inspired rather more sonnets than the occasion warranted. 
[B]: 跟着我这边请～ 🏨 已经让security discreetly clear the area了，保证no paparazzi！🌟 您的quill和vitriol都摆在perfect position...祝您duel愉快哦～ 💌  需要emergency scone supply的话就眨两下眼～ 😉
