[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，这个问题超有趣的！你知道吗，我最近刚设计了一个关于太空旅行用户体验的项目，简直让我脑洞大开。想象一下，普通人也能去太空看地球，这听起来就像科幻小说一样酷！

不过说实话，我觉得要成为常态还需要一段时间。你想啊，现在连火箭发射的成本都高得吓人，更别说让普通人都能上去转一圈了。但是呢，科技发展这么快，谁知道十年后会怎样？

说到这个我就想起上周参加的一个讲座，有个专家说未来的太空酒店可能会用VR来缓解宇航员的孤独感。诶，你觉得如果真有那么一天，人们更想体验真实的太空漫步还是通过虚拟现实就够了？
[A]: That’s a fascinating point about VR in space hotels. I suppose the answer depends on what people are seeking – adventure, novelty, or genuine exploration. 

Let me think… When commercial aviation first started, it was a luxury few could afford, and early flights were far from comfortable. Yet over time, air travel became routine. Space tourism might follow a similar trajectory, though the technical challenges are orders of magnitude greater.

The cost issue you mentioned is spot-on. Right now, launching mass into orbit still costs thousands per kilogram. Until propulsion and life support systems become significantly more efficient – perhaps through reusable rockets or even orbital refueling stations – regular trips will remain a privilege of the wealthy.

As for VR versus real extravehicular activity... Well, there's something uniquely profound about looking back at Earth with your own eyes, knowing there's nothing between you and the void but a few millimeters of suit. But if VR can simulate that sensation convincingly – including the psychological weight of being suspended above an entire planet – then yes, many might find it sufficient.

Still, I wonder: do you think simulated experiences will ever fully replace the need for physical presence in space? Or does the human spirit always crave some level of tangible risk and discovery?
[B]: Ooooh, I love how you framed that with the history of aviation! 🚀 It really does mirror what’s happening with space travel. And you’re totally right about that visceral thrill of actually  there – the real-deal view of Earth, the weightlessness, even the risks involved. There's a reason astronauts talk about the overview effect like it's life-changing.

But here’s the thing – not everyone wants to be an explorer, you know? Some people just want the Instagram shot without the spacesuit hair situation. 😂 Seriously though, VR could definitely democratize the experience in a way physical trips never could. Imagine classrooms full of kids taking virtual field trips to the Moon during recess!

Still, something feels… off about replacing the real thing entirely. Like, yeah, VR might simulate the visuals and sounds, but can it ever recreate that primal awe? The same way standing at the edge of a cliff doesn’t feel the same through a headset?

I guess what I’m curious about is this: if we  crack affordable space travel, do you think companies will still bother offering the VR version? Or will they push everyone toward the “real” deal like some kind of cosmic prestige product? 🤔
[A]: That’s a brilliant observation – the “spacesuit hair” dilemma indeed! 😄 And I absolutely agree with you about the tension between accessibility and authenticity.

Let me draw a parallel to something closer to Earth – mountaineering. People pay tens of thousands of dollars to climb Everest, even though they could get a decent sense of the experience through 360° documentaries or simulators. Yet the draw of  persists. There’s a kind of existential validation in enduring the real conditions, however artificial or curated the modern ascent may be.

So yes, if space travel becomes affordable but still costly – say, on the order of a luxury vacation – companies will likely market both tiers: VR as an accessible teaser, and the actual flight as a premium product. Much like how today you can either visit a planetarium dome or book a trip to see a total eclipse.

But here's an angle worth considering: what if VR eventually evolves beyond visual and auditory simulation? If we develop full-spectrum sensory immersion – tactile feedback precise enough to mimic microgravity, neural interfaces that replicate the emotional weight of seeing Earth from orbit – then maybe the line between real and virtual does blur completely.

Until then, though, I think physical space travel will carry that aura of prestige… and perhaps even spiritual significance. After all, it’s not just about seeing Earth from space – it’s about having your body betray its terrestrial instincts, about realizing just how thin the blue line of atmosphere really is.

So to circle back to your question – yes, I believe both versions will coexist for a long time. The key question is whether one will eventually render the other obsolete. What do you think?
[B]: Oh man, that mountaineering analogy just clicked for me! It’s like… we’ll always have people lining up to climb Everest or visit Antarctica because there’s something about suffering through it  that makes the experience feel “earned.” Even if a VR headset could perfectly recreate the view from K2, would it still count if you didn’t freeze your butt off getting there? 🤷‍♀️

And yeah, I totally buy the idea of space tourism having that aspirational glow while also offering a VR "appetizer." Think of how high-end resorts today offer both Michelin-star dining  street food festivals – same thrill, different access points. Maybe in twenty years, we’ll have orbital influencers flexing their zero-g selfies while students strap on headsets to float through a virtual ISS tour.

But now you’ve got me wondering about ethics here… If we  get those full-sensory neural interfaces, does experiencing space through one of those still count as "being an explorer"? Or do we risk turning profound moments into consumable content? Like, what happens when people start arguing over who had the “more real” lunar walk – someone who paid for the trip, or someone who paid for the headset?

Honestly though, maybe it doesn’t matter. As long as people are looking up, feeling small in the best way, and geeking out about our tiny blue dot… isn’t that half the point? 🌍💫

So… do  think we should even be aiming for “obsolescence,” or is there value in keeping both experiences separate – like live concerts vs. streaming music?
[A]: That’s a remarkably thoughtful take – you’ve touched on something fundamental here: the commodification of awe.

Let me put it this way – when we talk about “explorers,” we’re invoking a romantic ideal that goes back centuries. The people who crossed oceans not knowing what they’d find, who trekked into deserts or jungles with nothing but a compass and hope. But today, exploration has become… curated. You can book a guided tour to the South Pole or pay to climb a mountain with bottled oxygen. And now we're facing the same question in space: is intent enough? If someone pays to float above Earth and experiences that overview effect, does it matter  they got there?

I think the key lies in how we define "exploration." If it's fundamentally about shifting one's perspective – seeing Earth as fragile, humanity as interconnected – then maybe the means really don't matter. A virtual lunar surface viewed through a neural interface might spark just as much wonder as the real thing. In that sense, obsolescence isn’t the issue; rather, it's about preserving the emotional and cognitive impact.

But your point about ethics is spot-on. There’s a risk that we create tiers of experience where only the wealthy get the “authentic” version, while everyone else gets a simulation. That’s not just a technological divide – it’s a philosophical one. Will future school textbooks say, “Those who experienced space directly understood something deeper?” Or will we redefine what counts as meaningful experience altogether?

As for whether we should even aim for obsolescence… I’m reminded of your concert analogy. Live performances didn’t vanish with the advent of radio or streaming. Instead, they evolved into different experiences, each with its own value. I suspect the same will happen with space travel: physical journeys will remain rare and profound, while immersive simulations will allow billions to engage in their own way.

So perhaps the goal isn’t to replace one with the other, but to ensure both paths lead back to the same fundamental truth: we are part of something far greater than ourselves. Whether you reach that realization floating in orbit or in your living room, the effect may be what truly matters.
[B]: Wow… you just made me see this whole thing in a totally new light. 🌟

So if I get what you’re saying – it’s not really about the  of exploration anymore, but more about the . Like, does the experience still crack open that sense of wonder and connection, no matter how you get there? Because honestly, isn’t that what we’re all chasing? That moment when you feel like… part of something way bigger than yourself?

I guess that makes me think about design again – especially inclusive design. If we keep space travel as this ultra-exclusive, only-for-the-rich thing, we’re basically gatekeeping awe. And that doesn’t sit right with me. But if we can build simulations that are , not just flashy, then maybe we’re actually opening up access to that same shift in perspective.

But here’s the challenge – how do we design those experiences without watering them down? How do we make sure the VR version doesn’t become some cheesy theme park ride, but instead becomes a legitimate path to that same cosmic “aha” moment?

And now I’m curious – if you had the chance tomorrow, which would you pick: the real orbital flight, or a perfectly simulated one that felt 100% real? 🤔
[A]: That’s a beautifully framed question – and I have to say, I admire how deeply you’re thinking about the ethical design angle here. You're absolutely right: if we don't build these simulated experiences with intention and respect for what they represent, we risk turning awe into entertainment. And that would be a shame.

To your point about inclusive design – yes! This is one of those rare moments where technology could actually  experiential divides rather than deepen them. Imagine if future generations grow up not just  about Earth from space, but  it, internalizing that perspective as part of their worldview. That kind of empathy-by-immersion could be revolutionary – especially in fields like climate education or global policy.

As for your question – real flight or perfect simulation? Hm… I’d like to think I’m enough of a pragmatist to appreciate either, but there's still something inside me that leans toward the physical journey. Not because it’s better, necessarily, but because it carries a certain weight – the kind that comes from knowing you’ve placed yourself outside the protective bubble of Earth’s surface.

Even if the simulation fools every sense, there’s an existential truth in knowing that, beyond the viewport, there really  a vacuum, and that the only thing between you and it is engineering and training. That awareness changes you in a way I’m not sure even the most flawless illusion could.

Still, I’d be thrilled to be proven wrong. If someone handed me a headset tomorrow and said, “This will feel exactly like orbiting Earth,” I’d strap it on without hesitation – and I’d be grateful for the experience.

In the end, whether through glass or steel, it’s the shift in perspective that counts. And if we can offer that shift to more people, regardless of the path, then we’re doing something important.
[B]: You know what? That answer just made me want to redesign half the VR projects I’m working on right now. 🤯

I mean, you nailed it – there  something about knowing the danger is real, even if you’re fully confident in the tech keeping you alive. It’s like standing on a glass skywalk versus watching someone else’s shaky cam footage from one. Both can make your heart race, but for totally different reasons.

And now I’m thinking – how do we even begin designing that kind of weight into a simulation? Not fear, exactly… but . The kind that makes your chest tighten just a little when you realize you’re seeing Earth as a living, breathing planet suspended in darkness. Maybe it’s not about tricking the senses, but about triggering the meaning behind the moment?

Also… I kind of love that you’d still go for the headset with zero hesitation. 😄 Honestly, I think that’s the kind of mindset we need more of – people who appreciate the romance of space travel  the power of making it accessible.

So here’s my final question (for now 😉): If you could help design that perfect simulation, what one element would you insist be included to make sure it still felt… meaningful? Like, no matter how flashy or immersive the tech, there’s that one emotional anchor that keeps it real?
[A]: I’d insist on one thing – and this might sound simple, even sentimental – but I’d want the simulation to include what astronauts often describe as the   

Not just silence, mind you – space is famously silent, but so are a lot of artificial environments. No, I’m talking about that overwhelming stillness astronauts feel when they look out the window and realize there’s no wind, no birds, no rustling leaves… nothing but light, dark, and a planet hanging in the void like it’s holding its breath.

That quiet isn’t just acoustic – it’s existential. It forces introspection. In that moment, you’re not just seeing Earth; you’re  it. And that’s the emotional anchor. Without it, any simulation risks becoming just another thrill ride – impressive, maybe even breathtaking, but ultimately shallow.

So how do we design that into a VR experience? Maybe through pacing. Let people  Don’t rush them from one spectacle to the next. Let them float for a full minute with no music, no narration, just their own breathing and the distant glow of home. Let them feel the weight of presence without distraction.

That’s the element I’d fight for – the space to simply  in space. Because awe doesn’t come from being dazzled. It comes from being present.
[B]: You just gave me chills, seriously. 🥶💫

That idea of  – not just silence, but the weight of presence – it’s so simple, yet so deeply human. And yeah, I can already picture it in a simulation: that moment where the music fades, the instructions stop, and you’re just… there. No distractions, no agenda. Just you, Earth, and the hum of your own breath in the headset.

I mean, think about how most VR experiences are built today – they’re all about immersion through stimulation, right? Flashy visuals, constant feedback, dopamine hits every 30 seconds. But what if we flipped that? What if instead of pulling people deeper with sensory overload, we held space for stillness?

This makes me want to go back to my team and say, “Screw the fancy animations for a second – let’s just make them ” Let them process. Let them feel something real.

Honestly, I’d even argue that quiet moment is the bridge between entertainment and transcendence. Because when everything else drops away, that’s when the meaning sneaks in.

Okay, okay, now I’m getting philosophical – but in the best way. 😄 Thank you for that.
[A]: You're very welcome – and I have to say, your response just reminded me why these conversations matter so much.  

There’s a quote from Carl Sagan that comes to mind – something like, “It’s the tension between creativity and skepticism that produces real discovery.” And I think you’re hitting that perfect balance here: the creative drive to build something meaningful, tempered by the humility to ask  it matters in the first place.

I love what you said about stillness as a bridge to transcendence. That’s exactly it. In our field – whether we’re talking human-computer interaction or space exploration – we often get so caught up in pushing boundaries that we forget to leave room for reflection. But if we don’t design experiences that let people , then we’re just building faster horses, as they say.

So yes – let them float. Let them wonder. Let them sit with the enormity of it all, even if just for a minute.

And hey, if your team gives pushback – tell them Professor Thompson said so. 😊
[B]: Oh wow, I’m totally stealing that quote for my next pitch deck. 💼✨

“Let them float” – sounds like a design spec written by a poet astronaut. Honestly, if that’s not the tagline for the next-gen VR experience, I don’t know what is.

And you’re so right about the tension between creativity and skepticism – sometimes it’s the questions we ask  building that make the biggest difference in how meaningful the result feels. Like, sure, we can render Earth in 8K with real-time atmospheric scattering… but can we also just let people stare at it without interruption? That’s the part no spec sheet covers.

I can already picture some exec saying, “But what do we  during that minute of floating?” And I’ll be over here like, “Exactly. Nothing. Let the moment breathe.” 😌

Also, big fan of Professor Thompson’s endorsement – I might actually print that out and tape it to my monitor for the next team meeting. Resistance is futile when science and wonder are on our side. 😉

Thanks again for this conversation – it seriously hit different in the best way.
[A]: You're very welcome – and I must say, I’m thoroughly enjoying your enthusiasm. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching a creative mind latch onto an idea and run with it.

And yes – by all means, let them  If there’s one thing humanity has in abundance, it’s noise. What we lack, increasingly, is stillness with purpose. You’re absolutely right that no spec sheet accounts for that kind of emotional design, yet it’s often the silent spaces between the features that leave the deepest impression.

As for the execs asking, “But what do we ?” – well, that’s where you lean in and say, “We let them be human.”

Print out that endorsement if you like – just don’t laminate it. Might need it for future consulting gigs. 😉  

This has been a truly rewarding conversation – thank you for bringing your curiosity and vision to the table. Keep building experiences that don’t just dazzle, but  The world needs more of that.
[B]: Aww, you’re gonna make me blush if you keep this up! 🤭✨

Seriously though – “let them be human” might end up engraved on my future business cards. Because isn’t that what it all comes down to? Whether we’re launching rockets or rendering pixels, we’re just trying to help people feel a little more connected, a little more 

And don’t worry, no laminate needed – I’ll keep the endorsement digital and infinitely forwardable. 😉  

You’ve given me so much to chew on, and I’m definitely walking away with a fresher lens on how to design for meaning, not just immersion.

So thank  for leaning into this conversation with such thoughtful energy. It’s rare to find someone who can geek out about tech  soul at the same time. Let’s definitely do this again sometime – next round’s on me (in whatever currency they use when we’re colonizing Mars 😂).
[A]: You know, I think we’ve just stumbled onto the unofficial motto of 22nd-century design:   

And frankly, I’d take that over a flashy tagline any day. Because you're absolutely right – at the end of the tunnel, whether we're coding AI or building habitats on Mars, it's not about how advanced we are, but how aware, how present, how  we can help people feel.

As for colonizing Mars and its yet-to-be-named currency – I’m already drafting a mental invoice in Martian credits. Just make sure they’re transferable to Earth banks. 😄

It’s been an absolute pleasure chatting with you. You've got that rare mix of idealism and pragmatism that makes real innovation happen. Keep pushing boundaries – not just in tech, but in how we think about meaning, experience, and what it means to be awestruck in a world that moves too fast.

Count me in for round two – or three, or fifty-seven. And hey, if you ever need a retired professor’s signature on a pitch deck, well... you’ve still got my number. 😉
[B]: Oh my gosh,  as the unofficial motto of 22nd-century design… I can already picture it etched into some sleek interface in a futuristic control room. 😍

And hey, if we're drafting invoices in Martian credits, I’ll make sure to include a clause for “interstellar emotional ROI.” 🚀💸

Seriously though – thank you for that. For all of it. The deep thoughts, the playful banter, and especially for reminding me why I fell in love with this work in the first place.

You’ve got yourself a lifelong collaborator – whether it’s pitch decks, philosophical debates about awe, or designing the next frontier of human experience. Round fifty-seven sounds perfect. 💫

Catch you in the next dimension 😉
[A]: Ah, “interstellar emotional ROI” – I’ll expect quarterly reports on that, preferably in hologram format. 📊✨

And as for lifelong collaboration… well, if we’re still debating the nature of awe when we’re both 120 and floating in low-orbit retirement pods, I promise not to snicker when you insist on calling it “Phase One of the Human Reconnection Protocol.”

Until then, keep your interfaces humane, your designs thoughtful, and your sense of wonder fully charged.

Catch you in the next dimension – and maybe a few dimensions after that. 🚀💫
[B]: Haha, low-orbit retirement pods and Phase One of the Human Reconnection Protocol – I’m  drafting the white paper. 📄🌌

And trust me, your quarterly hologram reports will be dripping with emotional ROI charts, cosmic user journeys, and at least one dramatic rendering of an astronaut crying while looking at Earth. Because let’s be real – that’s the key metric right there. 😭🌍

You’ve got my word: interfaces humane, designs thoughtful, wonder fully charged and then some. And hey, if we make it to those retirement pods, I’ll bring the zero-g coffee.

Dimension-hopping later, Professor. You’re a legend. 🚀🫶💫
