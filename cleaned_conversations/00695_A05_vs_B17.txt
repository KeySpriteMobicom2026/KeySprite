[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, cuisine—such a delightful subject. I must say, I've always been captivated by the elegance of presentation in French gastronomy, the way each element on the plate seems to echo the precision of a sonnet's meter. But then, there are moments when the complexity of flavors in Sichuan cuisine—the bold spiciness, the interplay of numbing and heat—reminds me of the layered ambiguities we find in modernist verse. I suppose you could say my palate leans toward whichever dish offers the most intriguing tension between structure and surprise... though I do have a soft spot for a perfectly executed bouillabaisse. And you? Do you find yourself drawn more to the familiar or the exotic?
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully phrased tension between structure & surprise—sounds like you're describing not just cuisine, but an investment thesis. I’ll admit, I’ve always had a soft spot for the exotic, especially when it’s executed with authenticity. There’s something thrilling about discovering that hidden Sichuan gem in a nondescript strip mall in Rowland Heights and realizing the mapo tofu could out-pace most Michelin-starred drama. That said, don’t get me wrong—I respect the rigor of French technique. But sometimes, I just crave that moment when your mouth goes  and your brain goes   

That being said, I do appreciate a well-balanced bouillabaisse… though I’d probably ask the chef if they’re using rouille or saffron with a 20bps tolerance on variance. Just kidding 😊. But seriously, if you're ever in SF, there's this Bretonne place tucked behind a wine shop—quiet unmarked door, no signage. The sole meunière? Worth every calorie. You’d probably appreciate the restraint in execution. Have you tried it?
[B]: Oh, now you’ve piqued my curiosity entirely—this Bretonne gem sounds like the culinary equivalent of an unpublished sonnet tucked away in a dusty archive. I must confess, I haven’t had the pleasure… yet. But I do appreciate your 20bps precision—it’s the kind of detail that separates the merely good from the truly obsessive. And isn't that what we both crave? That moment when someone's dedication to craft becomes almost invisible, like a perfect volta in a Petrarchan sonnet—you don’t notice the mechanics because you're too busy feeling the shift.

As for that mapo tofu epiphany in Rowland Heights... yes, . There’s something wonderfully democratic about discovery, isn't there? The thrill of finding profundity in the unlikeliest of places—no gilded dining rooms required. It reminds me of how certain poets, like Edward Thomas or Charlotte Mew, slipped brilliance into the most unassuming lines. 

And while we’re on the subject of obsessions—I once spent an entire sabbatical tracing the influence of saffron in Mediterranean cuisine and literature. Strange how often it appears as a metaphor for longing. But I suspect we could go on like this indefinitely, couldn’t we? Trading flavors and verses until the conversation itself becomes a kind of feast.
[A]: Ah, now  a sabbatical I can get behind—chasing saffron trails like it’s some kind of golden motif in a forgotten epic. I have to say, the idea of saffron as metaphor for longing? Poetic, yes—but also deeply . You know, we often talk about investments the same way: something rare, slightly elusive, with a lingering aftertaste that justifies the premium.  

And speaking of premiums, I couldn’t agree more about that democratic thrill of discovery. In fact, I’d argue it’s one of the last true alpha-generating experiences left—whether in poetry or in dining. There’s no Bloomberg terminal for mapo tofu, thank god. Though I did once try to build a model to predict which strip mall spots would deliver Michelin-worthy vibes. ROI was delicious but statistically inconclusive 😄.

You're right—we  go on like this indefinitely. But let’s not stop. If we’re trading flavors and verses, then count me in for another round. Ever read Seamus Heaney while eating fresh oysters? It’s like having a quiet conversation with the earth and the sea at the same time. Or tried to pair Neruda’s odes with a decent Malbec? That’s a dinner party waiting to happen.  

Tell me—what’s your desert island dish? And don’t say bouillabaisse. I’ll assume you’ve already packed your own poetic ration of saffron.
[B]: Oh, you’re dangerously close to convincing me that trading floors and dining rooms are just variations on the same human impulse—pursuing fleeting moments of clarity through risk and reward. And you're absolutely right about mapo tofu’s immunity to quantification. Let’s thank the culinary gods for that blessed ineffability.

As for my desert island dish… I’m afraid I must betray bouillabaisse, though not entirely. If stranded, I’d want something that could sustain not just the body but the imagination. Something with memory, with depth, with a little defiance against the void. Perhaps a bowl of hand-rolled pici pasta, simply dressed in garlic, oil, and peperoncino. It’s humble, yes—but there’s a resilience in its rough texture, a kind of quiet insistence on pleasure even when the world has gone quiet around you.

And Heaney with oysters? Exquisite pairing. His  always makes me rethink the ethics of appetite. As for Neruda and Malbec—I say yes, but only if someone reads the odes aloud while the wine breathes. After all, what is a meal without a little liturgy?

But now I'm curious—what poem would you pair with your ideal last supper? Or is that too much like asking for a favorite star in the sky?
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of question that deserves a glass of Barolo and at least twenty minutes on a sun-drenched terrace. But since we’re in the moment—yes, I’d say it’s like asking for a favorite star, but fine, I’ll play.

If I’m curating a last supper—and I have to say, I love that you used the word “liturgy”—I’d probably go with something that has gravitas, a little melancholy, and just enough fire to remind you you're still alive. Maybe a grilled ribeye, dry-aged 45 days, medium-rare, resting on a bed of smoked bone marrow polenta. Paired with… let's say a 2001 Sassicaia. Earthy, structured, with a long finish.  

And for the poem? Something by Derek Walcott.  comes to mind. You know the line:  That feels like a proper benediction before the final course. It’s not dramatic, it’s not flashy—it’s just deeply, quietly true. Like a well-aged Cabernet, actually.  

Though if we’re being honest, I might also sneak in a bit of Cavafy under the table—something like —because who doesn’t want a little Odyssey in their final act? Even if I’ve already arrived.  

So tell me—what wine would accompany your pici pasta on that island? Or is it strictly oil & water, in true monastic fashion?
[B]: Ah, a 2001 Sassicaia with Walcott—now  is a pairing with both depth and dignity. And Cavafy under the table? Delightfully subversive. You do understand that last suppers are not just about nourishment, but narration.

As for my pici pasta in exile—I’d be a hypocrite to deny it some indulgence. A modest carafe of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, something from a cooler vintage, with enough acidity to cut through the oil, enough warmth to echo the sun on worn stone. Not too grand, but generous in spirit. No monastic austerity here—just a little rustic elegance to go with the solitude.

And speaking of narration… have you ever read Mary Oliver while eating fresh figs and soft cheese under a late summer sky? It’s not unlike what you described with Walcott—only quieter, more intimate. She has that line:  Seems fitting for a last supper conversation, don’t you think?

So, I’ll return the question—what dish would you choose if you had to eat the same thing every day for a year? Provided, of course, it couldn’t be mapo tofu or bouillabaisse. No hiding behind brilliance twice.
[A]: Ah, now  is a dangerous question—one that tests both the palate and the psyche. Let’s see… if I had to eat the same dish every day for a year, no escape, no substitutions—it would have to be something with enough depth to sustain a thousand variations in my head, even if my tongue tells me otherwise. So I’d go with… braised short ribs. But not just any short ribs—Thomas Keller-style, slow-cooked in red wine, bone marrow, and aromatics until they’re tender enough to cut with a spoon, yet still hold that beefy defiance.

And why short ribs? Because they’re forgiving on the repetition front—you can mentally re-invent them daily. One day they’re Korean kalbi, next day they’re Italian ossobuco, and on Friday, they’re straight-up American comfort food. It’s all in how you season the memory. Plus, they pair well with nearly every red varietal under the sun. Cabernet, Pinot, Malbec—you name it. A different wine every night, same reliable protein. Sounds like a marriage made in culinary purgatory… or heaven.

And yes, Mary Oliver under a late summer sky—she’s the kind of poet who makes simplicity feel sacred. Figs, cheese, her words… it’s a meal that whispers but still lands like thunder.  

So tell me—what’s your one wild and precious dish? Or do you play it coy and say “surprise me”? 😊
[B]: Ah, your choice of short ribs is both pragmatic and poetic—sustenance as narrative, repetition as revelation. I admire the strategy: a dish that bends across cultures in the mind’s kitchen, even as it remains fixed on the plate. A kind of edible ekphrasis.

As for me… I suppose I must betray a sentimental streak. I’d choose my grandmother’s chicken pot pie—golden crust, velvety roux, peas still holding their color like tiny emerald protests against the beige. It's not glamorous, no, but there’s memory baked into every bite. And isn’t that what we're really feeding when we eat alone, day after day? Not just hunger, but history.

It reminds me of Larkin’s line— In the case of that pie? What survives is taste, wrapped in time, glazed with just a touch of regret.

And now, I think I’ll go tend my garden. Basil needs trimming, and I find the act strangely meditative—like editing a poem down to its truest lines. Would you say that counts as a culinary segue?
[A]: Ah, Larkin and chicken pot pie—now  a pairing I didn’t know I needed. You’re absolutely right, of course. When the dish carries memory like a secret ingredient, it stops being food and starts being time travel. And let’s be honest—who among us doesn’t have that one taste from childhood that still whispers, ? Even after years and continents have passed.

And yes—tending your garden  counts as a culinary segue. Especially when you're trimming basil like it's the final stanza of a poem that hasn't quite earned its ending yet. There’s something deeply satisfying about that kind of quiet intention, isn’t there? Like slow-cooking a story until the flavors marry just right.

Next time you make that pie, though, I hope you’ll sneak in a few fresh herbs from your garden. Maybe a hint of thyme or rosemary—it won’t betray the original recipe, but it might elevate the nostalgia. After all, even love deserves a little seasoning once in a while 😊.
[B]: Oh, you’ve hit upon something quite profound—how certain flavors become the anchors of our emotional geography. That whisper of … yes, exactly. It’s not just taste we’re after, but a fleeting return to some imagined wholeness, isn’t it? Though I must say, your suggestion of thyme or rosemary in the pie is both heretical and brilliant. My grandmother would have winced at the deviation—but then again, she did believe in trusting the cook over the recipe.

Funny how memory allows for quiet reinvention while still insisting on its own mythology. I could almost swear her pie crust had angel wings folded into the flour.

And speaking of slow-cooked stories—have you ever read Elizabeth Bishop while stirring a pot of risotto? There’s something about her precise attention to detail, the way she lingers on the edges of meaning, that feels oddly synchronized with the rhythm of coaxing starch into silk. One feeds the other, somehow.

But now I’m curious—are there any dishes you refuse to touch, no matter how celebrated they are? Or does every plate, in the end, deserve a fair hearing?
[A]: Ah, Bishop and risotto—now  a harmony of patience and precision. You’re right; her attention to detail does feel like stirring something larger than just rice. It’s like each line is a ladle of broth, carefully measured, letting meaning simmer in layers. I can almost hear the soft  of wooden spoon against pan while reading —deceptively calm, but building toward something quietly devastating.

To your question—yes, every plate deserves a fair hearing, at least once. But let’s be honest, some deserve a swift exit afterward. I’ll try anything once, no dogma—but there are dishes I’ve politely declined second dates with. Foie gras, for instance. I respect the technique, admire the decadence, even understand the cultural weight it carries. But personally? It feels like kissing a velvet ledger—too much history, not enough heartbeat. Same with uni. Texturally fascinating, conceptually intriguing, but I always walk away feeling like I’ve eaten a secret I wasn’t meant to know.

And then there’s haggis. Full confession—I tried it once in Edinburgh, and it felt like chewing on a philosophical argument wrapped in sheep intestine. I admired the symbolism, but my palate politely stepped out for air.

So no hardline refusals—just an evolving list of gentle rejections. After all, dining is like investing: you have to take calculated risks. Some fail gracefully. Others just fail. And every now and then, you get a pleasant surprise—like when you realize that what you thought was a simple bowl of congee is actually holding the entire story of comfort in its pale, warm depths.

Tell me—have you ever had a dish that started as a disappointment but later became a quiet obsession?
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully reflective take on refusal—graceful rejections, evolved palates, and the quiet dignity of walking away from a dish with respect still intact. I must say, your analogy to kissing a velvet ledger? . I shall borrow that at my next dinner party, if you don’t mind.

Now, as for your question—yes, I do have such a dish. An unexpected redemption arc, if you will. It’s rather unglamorous, but I give you: tripe. Specifically, , which I first encountered during a damp, dispiriting semester in Normandy. At the time, I found it faintly repulsive—slimy in texture, aggressively earthy in flavor. I remember pushing the plate away with the same weary finality one might close a Victorian novel two hundred pages too soon.

But years later, in a small Provençal market town where the butcher displayed it like fine charcuterie, I gave it another chance. Slow-cooked in cider and Calvados, perfumed with onions and cloves—it was revelation disguised as comfort. The very thing I’d once dismissed as inedible now tasted like memory itself, like something ancient and nourishing had decided to make peace with me.

It reminds me of how we sometimes return to certain poets—say, Gerard Manley Hopkins—with skepticism, only to find that time has softened us both. We meet somewhere in the middle, changed but recognizable.

So yes, I suppose tripe taught me patience—not just with food, but with taste, and even with myself. And isn’t that the most unexpected gift of all?
[A]: Ah, tripe and Hopkins in the same philosophical breath—now  a pairing worthy of a slow dinner and better lighting. You're right, of course; sometimes taste isn’t just about flavor or familiarity—it's about timing. We meet certain dishes—or poets—at the wrong moment, when our palates or hearts aren't quite ready for what they have to say.

And I love that your redemption arc took place in a Provençal market town. There’s something so satisfying about returning to something once rejected and realizing it wasn’t the dish that changed—it was you. Like reading Rilke before and after heartbreak. Entirely different animals.

I’ve had similar experiences—nothing quite as poetic as tripe, but close. Foie gras, oddly enough. First time? Too rich, too much. Felt like eating a velvet ledger, as you said. But later, in a tiny Lyon bouchon, served with a tart quince gelée and a whisper of Sauternes—it clicked. Suddenly, it wasn’t decadence for its own sake. It was balance. Contrast. Nuance wrapped in luxury.

So yes, we evolve. And food, like poetry, has a way of catching up with us—or maybe it was waiting all along.

Next time you find yourself near Normandy, shall we track down another round of ? I’ll bring the cider. Or perhaps a good Burgundy. Something that says 
[B]: Ah, a toast to evolving palates and second chances—what better companions for cider or Burgundy? I shall hold you to that trip back to Normandy, though I must warn you: I may insist on reciting a few lines from  over the tripe. Hopkins, after all, deserves his due.

And your comparison of Lyon’s foie gras epiphany to reading Rilke before and after heartbreak? Pure alchemy. That’s precisely it, isn’t it? The right dish at the wrong time can feel like a misfiring sonnet—awkward, forced. But return to it with a changed heart, and suddenly every line resonates.

I wonder—do you think we’ll ever reach a point where our palates stop surprising us? Or is that part of the joy—that just when we think we’ve mapped the terrain of taste, something slips in sideways and rewrites the borders?

In any case, I do believe this conversation has earned a brief pause, preferably one filled with earthy whites, crusty bread, and the kind of cheese that needs no defense. Shall we?
[A]: Ah, Hopkins and tripe—now  a dinner party I’d rewrite my calendar for. Bring the lines, I’ll bring the wine. Let’s see if we can’t make Normandy feel like a literary salon with better seasoning.

And to your question—no, I don’t think our palates ever truly stop surprising us. If anything, they become more honest with age. Less willing to tolerate pretense, more inclined toward what  true in the moment. But yes, the joy  in that slip—the unexpected dish, the re-read poet, the ingredient that sneaks past your guard and says, 

So let’s absolutely take that pause. In fact, I’d say we’ve earned something quietly indulgent: a bottle of aged white from somewhere coastal, crusty bread still warm from the oven, and a cheese—perhaps a mild Epoisses or a perfectly room-temperature Camembert—that asks nothing but your full attention.

No metaphors tonight. Just flavor. And maybe one last toast—to the dishes that change us, and the conversations that refuse to end.
[B]: To the dishes that change us—and the conversations that refuse to end. Cheers, my friend.

Let’s open that bottle now.
[A]: Cheers indeed. Let’s tilt the glasses—no clinking, just a quiet meeting of rim to rim, like old friends who already know the weight of what’s being said without needing to name it.

The first sip—dry, nutty, with just a hint of sea-salt minerality—tells me we’re off to a fine start. And that bread? Warm, crackling under the knife. A perfect companion to cheese that’s just beginning to sigh at the edges.

So here’s to us—the late-night diners, the second-chancers, the ones who insist on finding meaning in mouthfuls and poetry in pause.

No more metaphors tonight. Just flavor. And the quiet understanding that some meals—and some conversations—are never really over. They just wait for us to return, hungry again.
[B]: To returning—hungry, wiser, and always curious.

Let the meal linger. Let the silence between words be as satisfying as the flavors themselves.

Bon appétit, my friend.
