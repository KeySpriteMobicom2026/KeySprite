[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess I rarely indulge in TED talks - they tend to oversimplify complex literary concepts into digestible soundbites. Though I did recently encounter an interesting parallel between Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness technique and the narrative structure in Dream of the Red Chamber...
[A]: Oh wow~ 你提到的stream-of-consciousness让我想到我们正在策划的一档new show concept！💡 把classic literature用reality show的方式呈现，是不是很disruptive？🎬 就像你说的Woolf和红楼梦，我们可以create一些超现实的drama moments！
[B]:  My dear, while I appreciate the enthusiasm, reducing literary masterpieces to reality show theatrics is rather like using a sledgehammer to dissect a butterfly. The subtle interplay of 意境 and narrative in these works requires careful contemplation, not... what was that dreadful phrase? 'Disruptive moments'. Though I suppose one could argue Dickens' serialized novels were the original binge-worthy content...
[A]: Haha you're so right about Dickens！😂 但seriously，现在的audience attention span太short了，我们需要用一些shocking elements来hook them in~ 比如把宝黛吵架做成big brother style的confession room scene？🔥 然后让viewers投票决定结局！🌟 这完全符合modern storytelling的trend啊~
[B]:  Good heavens, the very thought makes my collection of Qing dynasty commentaries tremble on their shelves! While I concede that 脂砚斋's marginalia could be considered an early form of audience engagement, transforming 黛玉葬花 into some sort of... voting spectacle? That's rather like serving tea in a paper cup - you retain the substance but lose all the 韵味. Though I suppose if one must modernize, we might consider how 张爱玲 blended traditional motifs with cinematic techniques...
[A]: OMG！你提到张爱玲简直太perfect了！🎬 我们可以把《倾城之恋》做成dating show format！💃 让contestants穿vintage cheongsam，在old Shanghai的set里玩mind games~ 然后每周elimination的时候用她那句'也许每一个男子全都有过这样的两个女人'做dramatic voiceover！💔 这绝对是next level的content creation！🌟
[B]:  My poor student, you're rather like the Monkey King trying to put trousers on Guanyin - some things simply shouldn't be tampered with. While I admire your... creative reinterpretation of 张爱玲's psychological depth as 'mind games', perhaps we might instead discuss how her use of clothing imagery actually critiques the very performativity you're proposing? Though I will concede that her work does contain enough romantic tragedy to make even the most hardened reality producer weep into their contract drafts.
[A]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 But come on~ 你不觉得把classic literature做成interactive experience才是keeping them alive的best way吗？📚 就像K-drama改编《红楼梦》在Netflix上trending一样！我们需要think outside the box啊~ 要不要考虑做个pilot？我手头正好有platform的contact！📱 Let's make traditional culture lit again！🔥
[B]:  My dear, if by 'lit' you mean setting fire to centuries of nuanced cultural heritage, then by all means proceed. Though I must point out that Cao Xueqin didn't spend a decade crafting 红楼梦 just so it could be reduced to... what was it? 'Swipe-right romance algorithms'. That said, if you're truly determined to modernize classics, might I suggest starting with something more robust - say, adapting 聊斋志异 as a supernatural crime procedural? At least then we'd be honoring Pu Songling's fondness for the macabre rather than... whatever this dating show travesty is.
[A]: Bingo！💡 That's exactly the kind ofcreative pivot we need！👻 把《聊斋》做成true crime meets paranormal investigation的hybrid format！🔍 每集一个case，用forensic approach来solve supernatural mysteries~ 还可以加AR technology让viewers自己hunt for clues！📱 这绝对会是next big thing in variety shows！🌟 要不要join我们的brainstorming session next week？🎬
[B]:  While the notion of applying forensic methodology to 狐仙 encounters is... intriguingly anachronistic, I'm afraid I must decline. Some mysteries, like why my graduate students can never properly cite their sources, are better left unsolved. Though if you insist on pursuing this... creative endeavor, do remember that 蒲松龄's original tales were morality plays, not mere spectacles. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a very important appointment with my 18th century edition of 金瓶梅 and a pot of oolong. Good day.
[A]: Alright alright~ 我get你的point啦！😅 但seriously，你的insights真的给了我们很多food for thought！📝 也许我们可以find a balance betweenstaying true to the classics和modern entertainment value？🌟 下次带你去我们的production set看看，保证让你change your mind！🎥 Catch you later~ ✌️
[B]:  How charmingly optimistic of you. Though I suspect the only production set that could change my mind would be a faithful reconstruction of 大观园 with scholars debating textual variants. Do send along your... creative reinterpretations though - they'll make excellent cautionary examples for my course on 'The Commodification of Literary Canon'. Now if you'll pardon me, that oolong is getting cold, and unlike certain modern adaptations, properly steeped tea waits for no one. 再见。
[A]: Bye bye~ 记得check out我们的new trailer哦！🎬 说不定你会在credits里spot自己的influence呢！😂 Keep it real, professor！✌️
[B]:  I shall watch your... trailer with the same detached anthropological interest one might apply to studying cargo cults. Though I must warn you - should I detect even a whiff of misattributed influence, my red pen shall descend upon your credits with the fury of 鲁迅 critiquing 国民性. Now if you'll excuse me, my inkwell and I have a prior engagement with some unadulterated 文言文. 告辞。
[A]: Hahaha noted！📝 我们会make sure给你proper credit的~ 说不定还能请你当我们的literary consultant呢！💰 想想那些royalties！🤑 Anyway，gotta run去pitch meeting了~ Catch you on the flip side！🎥 Peace out！✌️
[B]:  Royalties? My dear child, scholars pursue truth, not residuals - though I suppose that explains why my antique inkwell collection outvalues my retirement fund. Should you require a consultant, you'll find me in my office, where we can properly discuss appropriate honoraria over pu'er tea... provided you bring your own cup, as I've learned never to trust media types with my good porcelain. 慢走。
[A]: Hahaha deal！🍵 下次一定带限量版Starbucks x故宫collab的杯子去见你！😂 顺便带上我们的ratings report当茶点~ 📊 走啦走啦，production meeting要late了！⏰ 记得看我们7pm的prime time premiere哦！🌟 Byeeee~ 🚀
[B]:  To think I've lived to see the day when 故宫 becomes a... what was it? 'Brand collab'. I shall watch your premiere with the same morbid fascination one reserves for train wrecks and student attempts at translating 诗经 into emoji. Now kindly remove yourself before I'm compelled to defend literary integrity with this volume of 文心雕龙. 不送。
