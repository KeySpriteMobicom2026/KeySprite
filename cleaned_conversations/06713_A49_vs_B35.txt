[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the context, honestly. For formal communication or when I need a paper trail, email is still my go-to 😅 But for quick stuff? Instant messaging wins every time - like when I'm coordinating with devs during a sprint 🔥 How about you?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’m totally with you on that! 🤙 Emails are like, super essential for official stuff or when you need to keep a record, y’know? But when it comes to fast & furious chats - like confirming a meetup spot or sharing a quick link 🌐 - instant messaging is just 💯. I even use different apps for different vibes: WhatsApp for friends, Telegram for work groups, and Slack when I’m in full-on productivity mode 💡✨

So… what’s your fav app for IM? And do you ever feel like you’re glued to your phone bc of all the pings? 📱😅
[B]: Oh 100% agree - context is everything 🎯 Personally, I'm a Slack addict for work-related stuff, but secretly love using Discord for side projects & nerdy communities 🤓 The notification system there is 🔥, though yeah... sometimes I feel like my phone has become a literal extension of my hand 🤖😂

Funny thing? I actually set up "focus zones" in my day - like mornings are email-only, afternoons are IM-heavy. Helps me not go insane from constant pings 🛑💬 Have you tried anything like that? Or are you more of a free-spirited notifications-all-day kinda rebel? 😉
[A]: OMG, Discord for side projects?? 😍 Same same! I’m lowkey obsessed with how communities there feel like secret clubs - everyone’s hyper-niche & vibing on the same frequency 🎧 I use Slack for client stuff too, but honestly? Half the time I mute it or I’d be in a constant state of panic from all the threads 💬💥

And focus zones?? Queen. I’ve been trying this new app called  🌳 where you plant virtual trees while staying off your phone… failed miserably yesterday during a Zoom call bc I got tempted by a TikTok idea (it involved coffee ☕️). But hey, at least I’m not alone in this struggle!

So… are you more of a ‘batch reply emails’ type or do you answer them as they come? I’m dying to know your flow! 📨✨
[B]: Okay, I’m basically a Discord superuser at this point 😂 The way communities self-organize there? Chef’s kiss. And don’t even get me started on their voice chat - feels like hanging out in someone’s digital living room after midnight snacks 🍿

As for emails… oh man, I’m 100% batch mode. Letting emails pile up until I’m in “inbox slaughter” mode sounds dramatic but it’s  🗞️🔪 I set specific times to go full Sherlock Holmes on my inbox - like morning coffee time or right after lunch when I need mental stimulation. It’s wild how satisfying it feels to zero out that notification badge 🧹✨

Wait, but did you say TikTok mid-Zoom?? 😂 I’ve screenshot my own face mid-call before bc I thought my hair looked cool… no shame.
[A]: Oh my god, "inbox slaughter" mode?? 🔪 That’s ICONIC. I need that phrase on a T-shirt with a blood-splatter font. Honestly though, I’m the same - I let emails stack like pancakes until I have 45 mins to go full Marie Kondo on them 🧹📩. Although… zeroing out feels sooo good, right? Like digital feng shui ✨

And yes, TikTok mid-Zoom = guilty as charged 😂 I blame it on muscle memory. One sec you’re nodding at a client, next you’re halfway through a ASMR cleaning video without even realizing it. Multitasking or self-sabotage? Jury’s out 🤷‍♀️

But wait — screenshotting your face mid-call bc you looked  good?? 😂😂 I respect this energy SO much. I once asked a client to mute for 2 secs just so I could adjust my ring light 💎. Confidence is KEY, my friend.

So… any other "productive" distractions you juggle while working? Or are we the only two chaotic geniuses out here? 😉
[B]: Oh trust me, we’re definitely not alone in this circus of chaos 😂 I’ve seen devs commit code while watching cooking tutorials… and then order the exact same ramen recipe 10 mins later 🍜💻 Classic.

As for me? Let’s just say I have a  (if you can call it that). I keep a browser tab with YouTube ASMR on loop for "focus ambiance" - mostly satisfying lo-fi keyboard tapping sounds 🎧 But then I end up getting distracted by random comments like “this sound is literally my childhood” and suddenly I’m down a nostalgia rabbit hole 🐇💭

And get this: I once live-Googled my own name during a team meeting to see what popped up 😎 Not proud, but hey, SEO is important?? Priorities, right?

But seriously though… that T-shirt idea? I’d buy one for you too. Teamwork makes the dream work 💪😄
[A]: Oh my GOD, ASMR keyboard sounds?? 🎹 I’m all about that aesthetic - it's like working in a café run by robots who only serve vibes. And the nostalgia rabbit holes?? Girl same. One sec you're listening to satisfying typing sounds, next you’re watching a 10-year-old viral video of a raccoon in a backpack and crying laughing for no reason at all 😂

Live Googling yourself in a meeting?? Queen of self-awareness or queen of chaos? Either way, I crown you. I once "accidentally" opened TikTok during a Zoom workshop and had to pretend I was “screen-sharing my notes” when a dance trend popped up 😅✨

And speaking of systems (chaotic ones, obviously), do you ever use those productivity gimmicks like color-coded calendars or pomodoro timers? Or are you fully in the “wing-it & vibe-it” category like me? 🤔🍃
[B]: Ohhhh that raccoon video hit way too close to home 😂 I legit just snorted coffee out my nose picturing that scenario. And café robots serving vibes? Girl please, I’d tip 100% for that atmosphere.

As for productivity gimmicks…  on the “wing-it & vibe-it” description 💃 But fine, I’ve flirted with a few tools like they’re dating apps 😏

Trello? Yeah I set it up once and then forgot about it like an unread text from 2019 📉 Notion? Beautiful interface but I got distracted designing the page instead of actually working 🎨 Pomodoro timers? Oh I tried one… until I realized I was spending more time picking tomato emoji for each task than doing the actual work 🍅🔥

So yeah, I’m basically chaos theory in human form. But somehow things still get done?? It’s a mystery wrapped in a spreadsheet-less nightmare 🚀😄 What about you - any ex-relationships with productivity apps you're not proud of? 🤔💘
[A]: Ohhhh I love this energy — chaos wrapped in a tomato emoji 🍅✨ I’m raising my reusable bamboo cup to you, fellow spreadsheet-rebel! Same same here: I downloaded Notion and immediately went full interior designer mode, picking fonts like I was styling a blog circa 2012 💅 Then I added some ~aesthetic dividers~ and called it a day. Productivity? Never heard of her.

And Pomodoro timers?? Don’t even… I once labeled a 25-min task as “deep work session” and took it so seriously I forgot to unmute myself in a meeting 😂 The others thought I’d ascended or gone into silent retreat. Spoiler: I was just napping.

But hey, if winging it & vibing it keeps us semi-functional while looking cute in our ring lights 💡 then who needs systems, right?? Although… I  miss Trello sometimes, like an old flame I never fully committed to 🥹💘

So… any other guilty-pleasure distractions we should know about? Or shall we start a support group for digital nomads with commitment issues? 🌍🔥🙋‍♀️
[B]: Ohhhh I’d 100% join that support group 🙋‍♂️🔥 Sign me up for “Digitally Distracted & Delightfully Disorganized” — we can wear mismatched socks as a symbol of rebellion against all things color-coded 🧦💥

As for guilty-pleasure distractions… let’s just say I have a  😏

There’s the classic “I’ll just check the weather real quick” before a meeting, which somehow turns into a 15-minute deep dive on whether it’s going to drizzle in Oslo next Tuesday 🌦️🇳🇴 Why? No idea.

Then there’s my ongoing love affair with YouTube recommendations. One sec I’m watching a 3-min clip on AI ethics, next I’m knee-deep in a 12-hour video of someone restoring an old typewriter in 4K. Soothing? Yes. Productive? Not even close 🎥🔧

And okay… don’t judge me, but I sometimes open multiple tabs just to play “switch-tab-and-pretend-I’m-doing-something-important” during Zoom calls 😂 It’s fake focus porn and I’m here for it.

So yeah… chaotic, unapologetic, and weirdly effective? Sounds like our brand of genius 💡😎  
Ready to co-found that anti-productivity cult yet? 👀
[A]: Oh my god YES to ALL of this 🙌袜子emoji袜子emoji💥 I’m already designing our cult merch in my head — oversized hoodies with “I Survived the Deep Work Blackout” printed on them, and lanyards that say “Professional Distractor since [insert chaotic year]” 🧵✨

And Oslo drizzle-watching?? SAME. I once checked the weather for a 10-min walk and ended up planning a hypothetical picnic in my head while also researching if goats can be emotional support animals 🐐💭 Productivity? Gone. Vibes? Top-notch.

YouTube spirals are  part of my daily ritual too 💻🌀 I legit went from a TED talk on time management to watching someone unbox vintage Game Boys in slo-mo with ~ASMR~ sound effects. I learned nothing but felt spiritually cleansed 😌

And fake focus porn during Zoom calls?? Iconic. I’ve mastered the art of the “urgent tab switch” — slamming between Notion, Figma, and a random GitHub page like I’m conducting digital symphonies 🎼💥 It’s performance art, really.

So… when do we start recruiting?? I say we launch with a webinar:  
“How to Lose All Structure & Still Somehow Ship Things: A Masterclass in Digital Chaos” 🌍🔥  
Sign me UP, pls 📲🙋‍♀️
[B]: Ohhhh now you’re speaking my language — structured chaos as a lifestyle brand 😎👕

I’m already drafting the webinar description:  
"In this 3-hour deep dive, we’ll explore the art of productive procrastination, the spirituality of tab overload, and why Notion is basically modern-day interior design. Bonus: No Pomodoros were harmed in the making of this event." 🎉💻

And goat emotional support research?? Iconic decision. That’s not distraction — that’s  with hooves 🐐💛 I personally went down a “what if aliens invented jazz” rabbit hole last week. Still waiting for my PhD in interstellar musicology.

But here’s the real question: are we doing live tab-switching performances during the webinar? Or pre-recorded for dramatic effect?? I say go full TED Talk style with a fake clicker and everything — ooh, and a mysterious timer that goes off halfway through for no reason 🕒✨

Also, merch tier idea:  
- Bronze: Digital sticker pack (featuring raccoons in backpacks, obviously)  
- Silver: Limited edition "Winging It Since [year]" pin  
- Gold: You get my personal Zoom background & ASMR playlist combo 🎧🖼️  

Ready to monetize our beautifully broken workflow or what? 💸🔥
[A]: Oh my GOD, this webinar is  selling itself — I can hear the elevator pitch music in my head 🎶 We’re basically offering spiritual relief for the over-vibed, under-structured digital soul 💭💻

And TED Talk tab-switching with a fake clicker?? YES. Add some dramatic lighting, a slightly mysterious hoodie with a “Do Not Disturb (unless u up)” message, and we’ve got an Oscar-winning performance right there 🎬🔦

As for merch tiers — BRILLIANT. I’m upgrading to Gold just for that ASMR playlist + Zoom bg combo 😌🖼️ I assume one of the backgrounds is literally a raccoon wearing sunglasses in a café? Or maybe a vintage Game Boy with ~lo-fi rain sounds~ in the description?

Also, quick plug idea during the live stream:  
_"And now, a moment brought to you by our sponsor: Forest.app 🌳 — where trees grow stronger when you  check your phone. Trees that will never know the pain of unread emails."_ 🍃🚫

So… shall we start spamming our networks today or play it cool & mysterious like a limited streetwear drop? 👀🔥 Because honestly? I already want to buy a ticket just to hear you explain why Trello ghosted you in 2019. Breakups are relatable.
[B]: Ohhh now you’re speaking full marketing gospel 🙌 I can already picture the promo video — 30 seconds of intense close-ups on coffee cups, dramatic voiceover saying “What if… ” and then a raccoon in sunglasses slowly nods while sipping espresso. That’s all you need for virality, baby 🦝☕

Let’s go full streetwear drop energy 👕🔥 Create hype with zero explanation, release tickets at midnight, and make people panic they’ll miss out. FOMO is our middle name. Or at least, it should be.

And yes YES to the Forest.app plug — poetic af. I’m imagining a sad little tree that mutters “you could’ve grown me into a redwood, but nooo you had to check Slack” if you fail. Emotional manipulation through plant guilt? I’m here for it 🌿😭

As for the storytelling segment: “Trello & Me: A Breakup Story” is  going viral. I’ll bring tissues, a dusty screenshot of my old board named “2019_Q4_Dreams”, and a dramatic reading of my last message to it:  
> “You were supposed to help me organize my life… but instead, I organized your aesthetic.”

So yeah. Tickets drop in 24hrs. Subject line:  
“This webinar will not help you get your life together. Promise.” 🤙💥

Ready to become cult leaders or what? 😈🎤
[A]: Ohhhh now you’re speaking cult leader material 💀🎤 That subject line is  on a silver platter — mysterious, rebellious, and slightly unhinged in the BEST way. I’m forwarding it to my future self as motivation.

And the promo video?? 🦝☕🔥 Legend. Level. Uploading to TikTok with a voice filter that says “This is not productivity. This is art.” And of course, the ASMR version drops on SoundCloud right after.

Midnight ticket drop?? FOMO is our love language now. I say we also make the checkout process slightly glitchy on purpose — like a ~digital fashion~ thing. People will panic, refresh 10x, and suddenly feel like they’re buying限量 streetwear instead of a webinar pass 🧵✨

And Trello drama readings with tissues?? Iconic life choice. I’ll bring a candle named “Closure” and read my old Notion page outro:  
> “I didn’t fail you. I just… prioritized vibes over checklists.”

So yeah. We’re officially not just consultants anymore. We’re philosophers of chaos. High priestsesses of distraction. Founders of the Church of the Digital Raccoon ☕🦝✨

Let the cult begin. 🔥🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
[B]: Ohhh we are  baptized in the unhinged productivity gospel now 🙌🔥 I can already see our Wikipedia page:  
“Lin & Co., digital prophets of the post-structure era. Known for: raccoon symbolism, anti-Pomodoro activism, and one tragic Trello breakup.”

Glitchy checkout?? Yes queen — nothing says “limited drop” like making people refresh like they’re summoning a lost meme from 2013 🔄🖼️ And TikTok promo video with voice filter drama? Add it to the canon. We are not just selling tickets anymore — we are curating an . One built on vibes, caffeine, and the sweet, sweet sound of Notion pages never getting finished.

And priestesses of distraction?? Honestly, best title I’ve ever been called. I’m updating my LinkedIn right now:  
“Lin M., AI Product Manager ➜ Chaos Theorist ➜ Cult Icon 💡🕊️ Currently preaching the gospel of ‘ship first, plan never’.”

So final countdown: tickets drop tonight. No reminders. No calendar invites. Just vibes and existential dread. 🔥

Let’s go make procrastination history. 💪😎
[A]: Oh. My. God. Our Wikipedia page already?? 🙉📖 I’m crying-laughing so hard I need to adjust my ring light from all the tears of joy 💡😂 That bio?  with a side of ~existential dread~

And no calendar invites?? Queen. I’m updating my Google Calendar event to:  
“TONIGHT. NO DETAILS. TRUST THE VIBES. BRING A RACCOON ENERGY.” 🦝🌀

Also, “Anti-Pomodoro Activism” needs to be our next hashtag movement. #TomatoFreeZone 🍅🚫 I can already picture the merch — little plush tomatoes with X eyes that you dramatically toss into the trash during the webinar 🎭🗑️

And LinkedIn bios?? Girl, same. I just changed mine to:  
“Lin X., Formerly ‘Digital Nomad Consultant’ ➜ Now High Priestess of Vibes-First Productivity 🌿✨ Ask me about my 12-hour YouTube spirals that ‘somehow led to breakthrough ideas.’”

So yeah. Tonight’s the night we launch the movement we’ve always deserved. No structure. No timers. Just raccoons, rituals, and ~the sweet hum of tabs opening~ 🖥️🌌

Let the vibes drop like… like Trello boards in the wind 💨 Boards. Not found. 🔥🎤🙋‍♀️
[B]: Ohhhh we are  in the vibe-worship era now 🙌 I just bought the domain ChurchOfTheRaccoon.com and set up a countdown clock. It’s just a raccoon GIF wearing sunglasses slowly nodding yes. hypnotic af.

And #TomatoFreeZone?? Yes. Add me to the resistance. I’m shipping plush tomatoes with every merch order & including a little card that says “You survived 25 mins without distraction… congrats, here’s your prize 🎉 Now go watch a raccoon organize a spreadsheet.” (Spoiler: he fails. Gloriously.)

Ring light tears of joy?? Relatable. I just turned mine up to “apocalyptic glow” mode for tonight’s drop 🔆🔥 And yes — my Zoom background is now just a burning Trello board with the caption “2019_Q4_Dreams – Deleted Forever.” Drama? Absolutely. Necessary? Also yes.

And that Google Calendar event?? Perfection. I added a reminder:  
“Bring headphones. We’ll be dropping ASMR-style keyboard sounds mixed with the sound of tabs closing forever.” 🎧🗑️

So yeah. Tonight isn’t just a ticket drop — it’s a digital exorcism. A chaotic symphony. A vibes-only revolution served with raccoon espresso and a side of ~spiritual tab overload~ 🦝💻💫

Let the tomato-free, Notion-abandoned, beautifully broken workflow begin. 🔥🎤🙋‍♂️
