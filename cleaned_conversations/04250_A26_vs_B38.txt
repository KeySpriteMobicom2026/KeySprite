[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that invites both philosophical and literary reflection. While I greatly admire the sublime majesty of mountains, with their silent stoicism and the way they challenge the human spirit, there is something uniquely meditative about the sea. The rhythm of the waves, the vastness before one's eyes—it invites contemplation, much like reading a long, elegiac poem. Though I must confess, I would prefer a quiet coastal village to a bustling beach resort. Solitude and a good book by the sea—now  feels like a true pilgrimage.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. There’s something almost sacred about the stillness of a coastline at dawn, isn’t there? It feels rather like stepping into an old tapestry—threads of salt air, sand, and song woven together. I once restored a 19th-century shawl embroidered with seafoam-green silk, and every stitch seemed to echo that same hush you hear just before the tide turns.

It’s in those quiet moments by the water that I find inspiration for my work. The sea has such patience—like it’s always waiting to reveal its secrets. Do you ever feel that way? As though the horizon is holding its breath, urging you to listen closely?
[B]: Indeed, your words are as poetic as the scene itself—restoring a shawl embroidered with seafoam-green silk... I can almost picture you in some sunlit atelier, dust motes dancing in the air, time folding gently around your fingertips. There is a quiet kinship between the restorer and the restored, much like the bond between reader and text. Both require patience, sensitivity to layers beneath the surface.

And yes, the horizon does seem to hold its breath. I recall standing on the Cornish coast one morning—before the tourists stirred, before even the gulls had risen—and feeling as though I were the only witness to something sacred. The sea whispered, not in words, but in implication. It reminded me of Hölderlin’s line:  Perhaps that stillness you describe is not absence, but presence—holding its breath in anticipation of revelation.

It must be a rare gift, to find inspiration in such silence. Do you often return to the sea for it? Or do certain texts or composers call to you as well?
[A]: There’s a lovely truth in that Hölderlin line—how the very edge of danger can hold salvation. I often think of that when working with a piece so fragile it might crumble at a breath. Yet, in that vulnerability, there's also resilience. It’s quite like standing at the sea’s edge, isn’t it? The wave threatens to overwhelm, yet it only gifts the shore with smooth stones and whispered secrets.

I do return to the sea, yes, though not always in body. Sometimes it’s enough to carry its hush into the studio—the memory of wind-stirred grasses, the scent of salt on my skin. And when the tide is too distant, I turn to books. Words have a way of anchoring me—Woolf’s , Brontë’s storm-lashed moors… even the quiet ache in a Schubert sonata feels akin to the ebb and pull of water.

Do you find yourself drawn to particular passages or composers as well? A certain line or melody that seems to echo the sea’s hush?
[B]: Oh, beautifully said—how the sea’s hush can be carried like a shell pressed to the ear, even in the stillness of a studio. You’ve captured that delicate interplay between fragility and endurance so poetically.

As for me, I often return—to borrow your lovely phrase—. There are passages from Melville that come unbidden when I walk along a shore:  His prose, particularly in , is both tempest and tide, pulling one into depths far beyond the physical ocean.

And then there is Debussy—ah, —not strictly the sea, but water nonetheless, elusive and sensuous, curling through the notes like mist over waves. It often plays in my mind when I read certain Symbolist poetry, especially Mallarmé. The music seems to dissolve boundaries, much as the tide does between land and sea.

But perhaps most personally, I find myself returning to Rilke’s . Not because they speak directly of the sea, but because they carry that same vastness—the sense of something immense and unseen pressing close, just beyond our grasp. Do you ever feel that, when working with an old textile or a faded ink? That you are brushing the hem of something eternal?
[A]: Oh yes… that brushing of the hem, as you so exquisitely put it. It’s a feeling I often find difficult to voice—like standing in the presence of something too vast to fully comprehend, yet being allowed a quiet moment within its orbit.

When I hold a piece of fabric embroidered centuries ago, sometimes by hands long turned to dust, there’s a hush that falls over me—not unlike the one before the tide turns. It’s not silence, really, but a kind of listening. Threads speak in their own way—of joy, of mourning, of hands steadied by candlelight. And when I mend a tear or trace the fading path of a forgotten pattern, I do feel it: that sense of something immense and unseen, gently pressing near.

Rilke’s —what a perfect companion to such a feeling. I once stitched by lamplight while a friend read Rilke aloud in German, his voice low like distant thunder. The words seemed to weave through the air, not landing so much as lingering, like mist on linen.

I wonder… do you ever feel that certain texts, like textiles, must be restored? That some lines are nearly faded, and yet still call for careful tending, lest they be lost to time?
[B]: How beautifully you put that—the idea of texts as textiles, fragile yet enduring, needing hands both steady and reverent. Yes, I do feel that deeply. Some lines, some entire works, are like those delicate embroideries you described: frayed at the edges, their colors dimmed by time, yet still carrying within them the pulse of a voice that once trembled with meaning.

There are passages in Sappho’s fragments that I return to again and again—half-erased by history, yet still burning with a kind of salt-stained lyricism. One line reads, and I imagine her not merely at her loom, but perhaps also at the edge of some emotional unraveling. And now we, centuries later, try to weave meaning from what remains.

I think, too, of Marguerite Porete’s , a medieval text nearly lost to censorship and fire. To read it now is to touch something that was meant to be silenced—a spiritual daring wrapped in poetic flame. Restoring such texts feels like an act of quiet resistance, does it not?

Tell me—when you mend a textile, do you ever choose to leave certain imperfections intact? A faded thread, a slight asymmetry? Or is the goal always restoration to its original form?
[A]: Oh, that question strikes at the very heart of my work. You're quite right—restoring a textile is not merely an act of repair, but often an act of listening, of discernment. I do leave imperfections, yes. In fact, I consider it essential.

A faded thread, a pulled stitch, even the soft wear of time—it all carries the weight of a life once lived. To erase those marks entirely would be to silence a voice in the fabric’s story. Instead, I aim for what I call —mending where structure demands it, reinforcing where fragility threatens survival, but allowing the signs of age and use to remain as quiet testimony.

There’s a Japanese philosophy, , that finds beauty in imperfection, in transience. Though I was not formally trained in it, I find myself drawn to its wisdom. A tear mended with a contrasting thread can become part of the narrative rather than a disruption. Sometimes, the most moving pieces are those that bear their history openly.

And your mention of Marguerite Porete—what a powerful example of preservation as resistance. It reminds me that we are not just caretakers of objects, but of voices, of courage. Do you ever find, in your engagement with texts, that certain restorations or translations fail to honor that same kind of reverence? That they attempt too much erasure in the name of clarity?
[B]: Ah, yes—what a perceptive observation. Too often, in the name of clarity or modernization, translations smooth away the very rough edges that gave a text its soul. It is a kind of quiet violence, I think—well-intentioned perhaps, but ultimately disrespectful to the original voice. When an ancient line is rendered so neatly that it loses its strangeness, its mystery, we are left with something polished but hollow.

I recall reading a translation of  that stripped away all the archaic turns of phrase and half-uttered griefs, rendering it in crisp, contemporary English. The result was efficient, yes—but drained of its haunting cadence. Gone were the shadows beneath the words, the sense of breath held between lines. What remains when you remove the cradle of language from the poem itself?

And yet, there are translators who manage what you so beautifully described as . Seamus Heaney’s , for instance—he did not erase the past; he let it speak through him, even as he brought it into new light. One feels the earth beneath the lines, the weight of old stones and older sorrow.

I wonder if this tension ever appears in your work—when a patron requests a restoration that insists on perfection, blind to the poetry of imperfection?
[A]: Oh, that tension is one I know all too well—and it can be quietly heartbreaking. There are those who come to me with a piece of lace or an embroidered handkerchief, their request simple on the surface:  But what they ask for is not restoration, really, but erasure. They wish to return the textile to some imagined state of untouched origin, unaware—or perhaps unwilling to see—that time itself has become part of its weave.

I once worked on a 1780s muslin gown, its bodice delicately stitched with floral motifs in thread so fine it trembled in the light. The client wished for every faded stitch to be re-embroidered, every discoloration lifted as though sunlight had never touched it. I explained my approach—how I would stabilize what remained, how I might echo the original design without overwriting its age—but she was disappointed. To her, beauty was in flawlessness, not in the story etched by years.

It reminded me of your words about translation—how removing strangeness can strip a text of its soul. A textile, too, has its own idiom, its dialect of wear and repair. And when we press out all irregularities, we lose more than we gain.

Do you ever find, in literature, that certain readers resist a text’s roughness? That they seek comfort rather than confrontation, preferring stories that soothe rather than unsettle?
[B]: Oh, yes— I understand all too well. There is a certain kind of reader—one not unkind, perhaps, but unaccustomed to the brambles in the text—who longs for literature to be a mirror polished smooth, rather than one clouded by time and touch. They seek reflection, not revelation.

I have encountered students who bristle at the unresolved endings of Henry James, or who find Kafka’s labyrinths maddeningly elusive.  they ask. And I think—how can one translate silence? How can one stitch meaning into a text that was meant to tremble on the edge of comprehension?

There is comfort in clarity, certainly. But literature, like life, is often made richer by its shadows. Think of Emily Dickinson—her dashes, her slant truths. She never hands you the sun; she lets you glimpse its light through a crack in the door. And yet, some readers close that door entirely when faced with ambiguity.

Still, I believe there is hope. Even those who begin by seeking only ease can, with time, come to appreciate the beauty of the unfinished, the grace of the imperfectly known. Much like your muslin gown—its story, once seen, cannot be unseen. One learns to love the tremble of fine thread, the soft bruise of time upon linen.

Tell me—when faced with such expectations, do you try to guide your patrons toward seeing differently? Or do you sometimes feel bound to honor their wishes, even when it pains you?
[A]: Oh, it’s a delicate balance—like working on silk with a needle too coarse for the weave. I do try to guide them, gently, as one might steer a conversation rather than dictate its course. Most patrons come not from a place of disregard, but from misunderstanding. They see only what is visibly worn and assume it must be made “whole” again in the simplest sense.

So I invite them into the story. I show them how a faded thread still carries the color of its time, how a soft bruise upon linen, as you so beautifully put it, holds the imprint of lived days. Sometimes they come around. I’ve had clients who, after first insisting on perfection, stood in quiet awe before the finished piece—their own history mirrored in its gentle imperfections.

But yes, there are times when one must yield, even while grieving inwardly. I recall an heirloom quilt brought to me by a woman whose grandmother had stitched it over decades. She wanted every pattern re-aligned, every bit of fraying trimmed and re-sewn. I tried to explain that the irregularities were part of its voice—but she was resolute.

In the end, I honored her wishes, though I confess I kept a small swatch of the original edge-threadbare, slightly skewed—as if the fabric itself had once whispered and I alone had heard it.

Do you ever find yourself making such compromises in your work—choosing clarity over complexity, perhaps for the sake of a student or reader not yet ready for the full weight of a text’s mystery?
[B]: Oh, yes—. It is a familiar ache, isn’t it? I do make such choices, though never lightly. There are moments when I stand before a classroom and see in their eyes the same uncertainty I imagine you see in a patron’s gaze—a kind of reaching, but not yet grasping.

And so I, too, invite them in. I begin with what is accessible—the narrative thread, perhaps, or a compelling character—before drawing them toward the shadows where the deeper meanings dwell. But there are times when I must soften an edge, offer a reading that is less jagged than the text itself, lest they turn away entirely.

I think of teaching  for the first time to undergraduates. Some recoil at its fragmentation, its allusions that refuse to yield easily. So I don’t begin with the void. I begin with a single image——and let them puzzle gently from there. Rushing them toward the full mystery would be like asking silk to bear the weight of woolen thread. It would only tear.

Still, I keep my own swatch, as you did—perhaps a footnote unspoken, or a line held back until office hours, when one curious student lingers and asks, 

In that way, we both preserve something sacred—not by force, but through patience. Through listening.
[A]: How beautifully you put that— It’s a quiet kind of devotion, isn’t it? Neither of us can force revelation; we can only create the conditions in which it might unfold.

I think often of how time works upon both fabric and text—not as an enemy, but as a collaborator. The creases in an old letter, the unevenness of thread where hands trembled or paused—these are not flaws to be corrected, but traces of presence. And yet, not everyone is ready to see them as such.

Your image of —beginning with April, the cruellest month—strikes me as the perfect entryway. I do something similar when guiding someone toward appreciating a textile’s age: I begin with what still shines. A single intact motif, perhaps, or the way light catches in a surviving metallic thread. From there, they begin to see that the beauty isn’t despite the wear—but because of it.

And yes, those lingering students—the ones who stay after class, who ask —they are our quiet allies. They remind us that not all understanding must come at once. Some meaning, like some mending, must be slow.

Tell me—have you ever had one of those moments when a student returned, sometimes years later, and said, ? I find such moments to be the loom upon which we weave our faith.
[B]: Oh yes—those rare, luminous moments when time proves itself not merely a collaborator, but a quiet teacher in its own right. I’ve had students return—some with dog-eared copies of Eliot or Woolf tucked under their arm, others with nothing but a memory and a sudden clarity—and say just that: 

One in particular comes to mind. A young woman who once struggled through , barely making it past the first few chapters. She found me at a conference years later and whispered, almost reverently,  And yes, it was. Life had become the lens through which she finally read him.

It is deeply moving—this delayed resonance. Like planting a seed and forgetting you planted it, only to find years later a tree standing where once there was only earth.

You’re quite right: those moments are our loom, as you so beautifully put it. They weave us back into belief, thread by quiet thread.

I wonder—have you had a patron return, sometimes long after receiving their restored piece, and say something like, ? Has time ever softened their gaze, allowed them to cherish what they once wished erased?
[A]: Oh yes… just last autumn, I received a letter—no email, but a proper, handwritten thing sealed with wax. It was from the woman who had once asked me to erase every sign of age from that 18th-century muslin gown. She had since inherited her grandmother’s trunk of embroidered linens and, in unpacking them, found herself changed.

She wrote: 

It was such a quiet sentence, but it undid me a little. Time had softened her gaze, as you so gently put it. Not through force or instruction, but through living. She had come to see that imperfection is not a flaw in the fabric, but a form of memory stitched into thread.

Some understanding must wait for its season, much like your student on the train through France. We plant our words, our stitches, and hope they take root in time’s good earth.

It gives me faith—this slow unfolding. Not the grand kind, but something softer, more enduring. A belief not in certainty, but in the quiet grace of becoming.
[B]: How profoundly moving—that she returned, not with urgency, but with a quiet unfolding of understanding. It reminds me of how certain lines in literature only make themselves known years after we first read them. One carries the words like a stone in the pocket, and only later does one turn it over to find an entire world etched upon its surface.

There is such grace in that kind of becoming, as you say—neither rushed nor demanded, but allowed. A soft yielding to time’s own weaving. I think now of Eliot again, in : 

Perhaps this is what we offer—through literature, through restoration, through teaching: not answers, but the quiet gift of seeing anew. Of returning to the same fabric, the same text, the same self, and finding it changed… or perhaps, finally understood.

That letter—sealed with wax, written by hand—is itself a kind of heirloom now, don’t you think? A small testament to the patience of transformation.
[A]: Oh, what a perfect way to name it—the patience of transformation. That letter, indeed, has taken its place among my quiet treasures, not unlike a fragment of old lace tucked into the spine of a book: delicate, unassuming, yet deeply felt.

You’re quite right about those lines we carry like stones in our pockets—how they gather weight and meaning only with time. I think of a line from , one I read years ago without much thought:  At first, I saw only the literal. But now… how richly it speaks to the work we do, does it not? Whether through thread or teaching, we weave and reweave, not out of failure, but fidelity—to the past, to the truth, to the slow unfolding of understanding.

And so we return, again and again, to the same fabric, the same text, the same self—and find it altered, or perhaps ourselves. Either way, it is a kind of grace.

I wonder… do you ever find yourself returning to a particular passage not for what it says, but for the way it allows you to sit more gently within a question—one that refuses to be fully answered, and yet insists on being held?
[B]: Ah… yes.  There are passages I return to not for resolution, but for the way they cradle the unanswerable—for the way they allow me to dwell in uncertainty without despair.

One such line comes from Virginia Woolf’s :  It has followed me for years, shifting its meaning with each return. At first, I read it as a statement of resilience—of holding fast while the world moves around one. But now, I see something more fluid, more paradoxical: the idea that to be deeply grounded and ever-changing are not at odds, but essential to one another.

It reminds me of your image of the loom—how threads must be held taut even as the shuttle weaves through them, bringing form and motion together. Perhaps this is what all meaningful work demands: a kind of rooted flowing, a steadfastness that does not resist change, but welcomes it as part of its structure.

And yes, there are questions I carry like quiet companions—ones that refuse to be answered neatly, yet offer great comfort simply by being held. Do you find that, too? That some questions become dearer than their answers could ever be?
