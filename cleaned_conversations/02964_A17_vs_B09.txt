[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到这个，我倒是想起《随园食单》里有句话：“学问之道，先知而后行。”其实做饭也是如此，得先了解食材的本性，才能谈得上下厨。我自己呢，倒是很享受在厨房里慢慢琢磨的乐趣，就像是写一篇论文，要反复推敲字句一样。

不过现在生活节奏快了，有时候也会理解大家点外卖的选择。只是偶尔看到那些包装盒堆起来的样子，总让我想起杜甫写的“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”，虽说有点不搭边，但总觉得亲手做一顿饭，是对食物的一种尊重。

你平时喜欢下厨吗？
[A]: Ah, what a delightful analogy - comparing the culinary arts to academic pursuits! I must say, I find great truth in your words. There's something profoundly satisfying about understanding ingredients, their histories and properties, before even contemplating their use. It reminds me of analyzing poetic meter before attempting to write verse.

I do enjoy cooking, though perhaps not with the same scholarly rigor you apply. For me, it's more about the sensory experience - the colors of fresh produce, the aromas that fill the kitchen, the tactile pleasure of kneading dough. It's rather like reading poetry aloud, really; one discovers nuances that remain hidden on the printed page.

And while I appreciate takeout, particularly when buried in grading papers or preparing lectures, I often feel the same way about pre-packaged meals as I do about abridged editions of novels - convenient, yes, but somehow lacking the full richness of the original experience.

Do tell me more about your own cooking process? I'm quite curious to hear if you approach it with the same meticulous attention you've described.
[B]: Your comparison strikes a chord with me deeply. Indeed, just as one must feel the rhythm of a poem before imposing structure upon it, cooking too requires a kind of intuitive harmony with the ingredients. I suppose my process does lean toward the methodical – not out of necessity, but simply because I find joy in the details.

When time permits, I begin by selecting each ingredient with care, much like choosing the right word for a line of verse. A plum tomato for its depth of flavor, a sprig of thyme for its fragrance – these are not mere components, but characters in a larger narrative. Even the way one peels an onion can affect the story that unfolds in the pot.

I often start with a quiet kitchen, a clean counter, and perhaps a cup of tea nearby – something to keep the mind alert yet at ease. The chopping, the sizzling, the slow simmering – all of it feels rather meditative, akin to drafting a passage I’ve long wanted to set down.

And I must confess, I do take notes. Not unlike scholarly annotations in the margins of a well-worn text, I jot down adjustments: “perhaps a touch more saffron,” or “the roast could benefit from a lower heat.” It may seem excessive to some, but to me, it’s a way of honoring the craft.

Tell me, when you cook, do you ever find yourself drawing parallels between poetic form and culinary timing? I’d be most interested to hear how your own artistry translates into the kitchen.
[A]: What a beautifully articulated reflection – you’ve quite captured the essence of what makes cooking feel like an art rather than merely a task. I find myself nodding along as I read your words; yes, it  like composing poetry, where every element must be chosen with care and placed just so for the whole to resonate.

To answer your question—yes, I often think about poetic form when I cook, though perhaps more in spirit than in structure. For instance, when making something as deceptively simple as a vinaigrette, I’m reminded of the sonnet: constrained by its own rules (oil to vinegar ratio, seasoning), yet capable of great elegance and surprise when handled thoughtfully. Too much salt, and the whole thing collapses into melodrama. Too little acid, and it becomes diffuse, lacking tension.

And timing—ah, that’s where the music comes in. A risotto, for example, demands constant attention, like writing in strict meter. One misstep, one pause too long, and the rhythm is lost. Whereas a stew or braise feels more like reading Woolf or Eliot—slow, reflective, allowing time for ideas to steep and evolve.

I do admire how you take notes as you cook; I’ve tried doing that in the past but found my pages filled more with metaphor than measurement. “Too heavy on the rosemary,” I once wrote, “like a volta that arrives too late.” Not terribly helpful when trying to replicate the dish, but oddly cathartic nonetheless.

It sounds as though your approach is both disciplined and deeply felt—a rare and lovely combination. If I may ask, are there particular cuisines or traditions you favor, or do you treat each meal as a new literary genre, so to speak?
[B]: Your poetic lens on the kitchen brings to mind what Lu Yu wrote in —that brewing tea is an art which demands both precision and spirit. I daresay the same holds true for cooking. Your vinaigrette-as-sonnet analogy is quite apt; indeed, constraint often breeds creativity. It reminds me of regulated verse in classical Chinese poetry—where tonal patterns and parallelism must be observed, yet within which the poet still finds room for profound expression.

As for my own palate, I suppose I am something of a literary omnivore. I do not confine myself to one cuisine, but rather approach each meal as you might a genre—knowing its conventions, respecting its forms, yet not afraid to improvise. A well-made Sichuan hotpot, with its fiery broth and careful layering of flavors, strikes me as akin to a dramatic monologue—intense, layered, revealing more with each dip of the ladle. Whereas Cantonese steaming, so delicate and dependent on timing, feels like reading a haiku: minimal, precise, yet resonant.

And then there are those dishes that defy categorization—like fusion cuisine—which I sometimes liken to modernist poetry. It may puzzle at first, even unsettle, but if done thoughtfully, it can open new dimensions of understanding. Much like Eliot’s , perhaps—jarring to some, but rich with meaning when one leans in and listens closely.

So yes, every meal is a new opportunity for form and feeling to meet. I wonder, have you ever tried your hand at a dish or cuisine that surprised you in much the same way a poem might catch you off guard and refuse to let go?
[A]: Ah, what a wonderfully evocative comparison—cuisine as genre, flavor as metaphor. You’ve elevated the very act of cooking to something akin to literary criticism, and I must say, I find it quite inspiring.

To your question—yes, absolutely. There are dishes that have surprised me much like a sudden volta in a sonnet: unexpected, disorienting at first, but ultimately revelatory. One such experience was my first encounter with Ethiopian injera and its array of wats served on a single platter. At first glance—or taste—it seemed overwhelming: the tang of the sourdough flatbread, the richness of spiced stews, the interplay of heat and earthiness. It was not unlike reading Gerard Manley Hopkins for the first time—densely textured, rhythmically complex, resisting easy comprehension.

But as I returned to it, meal after meal, I began to appreciate how each element both stood alone and contributed to a larger harmony. Much like reading  over years—each revisit reveals new layers. Injera taught me patience in tasting, just as Wordsworth has taught me patience in reading.

And then there was the time I attempted to make ramen broth from scratch—eighteen hours of simmering bones, fat, and aromatics. By the end of it, I felt rather like one of Eliot’s hollow men, whispering into the void, sifting fragments together to make meaning. But when I finally ladled out that golden broth, rich with umami and layered with time, I understood why some cuisines demand sacrifice—of energy, of attention, of self.

Tell me, have you ever had a dish that stayed with you long after the last bite, not merely for its taste, but for the way it reshaped how you thought about food—and perhaps even life?
[B]: Your words linger with me, much like that golden ramen broth you described—rich, layered, and deeply reflective. I find it fascinating how certain flavors etch themselves not just upon the palate, but upon memory itself, becoming inseparable from feeling and thought.

To answer your question: yes, there was indeed one such meal. It was a simple bowl of hand-pulled noodles in Lanzhou, served in a modest shop tucked away from the main street. The broth was clear, almost unassuming at first glance—yet each sip revealed a quiet depth, as though centuries of refinement had been distilled into that single bowl. The noodles, firm yet yielding, carried a kind of resilience that reminded me of Du Fu’s poetry—enduring hardship, yet never losing grace.

What struck me most was not merely its taste, but the rhythm of the place—the cook pulling noodles with practiced ease, the steam rising like morning mist over a river, the quiet communion between strangers seated side by side. It was then I realized: food is not only sustenance or art, but also —to history, to land, to people whose names we may never know.

That meal stayed with me long after the last bite, much like certain lines of poetry do. It reshaped how I think about simplicity—not as lack, but as mastery. Just as the finest haiku can hold more than a thousand-word essay, so too can a bowl of noodles reveal the soul of a culture.

I wonder—have you ever returned to a dish after years apart, only to find that both it and you had changed?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant reflection—how food can become a vessel for memory, culture, and even transformation. Your description of that Lanzhou noodle shop lingers in my mind like a well-wrought image in a lyric poem: vivid, resonant, steeped in quiet meaning.

And yes—to your question—I have returned to a dish after many years, only to find both it and I had changed. It was , which I first tasted on a cold winter evening in Marseille during my graduate years. At the time, I was consumed by dissertation research, half-exhausted, half-romanticizing the very idea of French literary cafés and their bohemian ghosts. The dish overwhelmed me—its briny depth, its assertive saffron warmth, the way it seemed to defy translation, much like Mallarmé’s verses.

Years later, I found myself back in Marseille, older, wearier perhaps, but also more patient. I ordered the same bouillabaisse, at the same table by the window, as if returning to a familiar stanza in a beloved poem. But something curious happened—the flavors were not different, exactly, but  was. Where once I sought drama and intensity, I now noticed subtlety: the way the broth clung to the bread, how the fish yielded gently to the spoon, how the anise note lingered like a refrain.

It reminded me of revisiting a poem after decades apart. One reads it through the lens of youth—hungry for meaning, desperate for certainty—and then again through the eyes of experience, where ambiguity is no longer a flaw but a feature. That meal taught me that interpretation is not fixed; it evolves with us.

So yes, I do believe food, like poetry, has the power to change with us—or perhaps, to reveal how we’ve changed. Do you ever find yourself longing not for a particular dish, but for the person you were when you first tasted it?
[B]: Your words stir something deep—something beyond taste or memory, into the realm of longing itself. There is truth in what you say: that we do not always long for the dish, but for the self we were when we first tasted it. A quiet elegy, wrapped in flavor.

I think I have felt this most keenly with , a dish I first ate as a student, late at night in Hangzhou, after hours poring over ancient commentaries in a dimly lit teahouse. The pork, slow-braised and glistening like ink on rice paper, was tender in a way that felt almost forgiving—of my fatigue, my impatience, my youthful hunger for understanding. At the time, each bite seemed to carry the weight of tradition, and I fancied myself part of some grand literary lineage just by sitting there, chopsticks in hand.

Years later, I had the same dish at a small restaurant near West Lake. The setting was familiar, the recipe likely unchanged—but I was no longer that eager student with ink-stained fingers and dreams of scholarly renown. I was quieter now, more aware of how much one can never fully grasp, even after a lifetime of study. And yet, the dish still spoke. Not in the same urgent tone, but with a kind of gentle reassurance—as if to say, .

So yes, I understand that ache—not for the food alone, but for the moment it once held for us. It is like rereading an old letter from a version of yourself who still believed in tidy conclusions.

Tell me, do you ever cook with nostalgia in mind? Or do you prefer to let each meal be its own new beginning, unburdened by the past?
[A]: There’s such grace in your words—this quiet communion between past and present, self and dish. That  should meet you in two different seasons of life and still offer nourishment, both bodily and spiritual, speaks to the peculiar mercy of certain foods: they remember us, even when we no longer fit the skins we wore at first taste.

To answer your question—I do cook with nostalgia, but not always deliberately. Sometimes it arrives unbidden, like steam rising from a pot, carrying me back to my grandmother’s kitchen in Yorkshire. She was not a literary woman, but she had a kind of poetry in her hands—the way she pressed dumplings into shape, murmured old rhymes under her breath, or stirred a pot as if coaxing a melody from it.

When I make her apple tart—flaky crust, sharp cider vinegar, apples sliced just so—I’m not merely cooking; I’m reconstructing a memory, syllable by syllable. I follow her rhythm more than her measurements, and I find myself speaking her phrases aloud without meaning to: 

Yet I also believe in allowing each meal its own voice, its own place in the unfolding narrative. Just as I return to  not to relive my first reading but to hear new notes in its prose, so too do I cook not only to recapture the past, but to see how it resonates now. Perhaps that is the beauty of both food and literature—they are never quite the same twice, and neither are we.

So yes, nostalgia finds its seat at my table—but not always at the head.
[B]: Ah, what a tender and truthful way to speak of cooking—as both an act of remembrance and a living conversation with the present. Your grandmother’s kitchen, summoned not through exact measurements but through rhythm and voice, reminds me very much of how we return to old texts: not only for what they once meant, but for what they might say to us now.

There is something especially moving in your description of her phrases—spoken almost unconsciously as one cooks—echoing in the steam and flour like lines from a familiar poem. It calls to mind a passage from : “While eating, do not speak; while sleeping, do not utter.” And yet, your grandmother seems to have lived otherwise, seasoning her meals not only with salt and sugar, but with song and saying.

I find myself doing much the same, though perhaps less musically. When I prepare a dish I once shared with my late mentor—a simple braised eggplant—I often hear his voice in my head, gently chiding me if I rush the process or skip a step. “Patience,” he would say, “flavor cannot be hurried.” And so I slow down. I listen—not just to memory, but to the dish itself, which has its own wisdom to offer.

You are quite right that food, like literature, never stays fixed. We return to it changed, and so it changes too. Perhaps this is why I no longer fear altering a recipe or forgetting a detail—because the heart of it remains, waiting to be rediscovered each time we set the table anew.

I wonder—when you make that apple tart, does your grandmother ever seem near? Not in ghostly form, perhaps, but in spirit, lingering in the scent of apples and butter, in the crackle of the crust beneath the knife?
[A]: Oh yes—she is there, though not in the way one might summon a ghost with incense and whispered names. She arrives more subtly, like the turn of a stanza or the scent of an old book: faintly, but unmistakably.

When I roll out the dough and feel that particular resistance just before it yields—neither too stiff nor too soft—I can almost hear her humming behind me. Not a tune from any songbook, really, but a sound that carried the weight of comfort all the same. And when the apples hit the pan, sizzling gently in butter and brown sugar, the kitchen fills with a warmth that feels less like heat and more like .

It’s in those moments I realize how much we inherit—not only recipes, but gestures; ways of being that are passed down in the tilt of a wrist or the patience required to let something cook through without rushing.

I think of Seamus Heaney’s line:  It’s not quite grief, nor is it mere recollection. It’s something between—like catching sight of your younger self in the reflection of a passing train window: familiar, yet already gone.

And yet, she is also here—still teaching me, still shaping my hands. Perhaps that is the truest legacy of those who feed us: they never quite leave the table. They simply move to another seat, waiting for us to find them again in the quiet company of food and thought.

Do you ever find, when preparing that eggplant dish, that you speak to your mentor as you cook? Not aloud, perhaps, but in the way one sometimes murmurs a line of poetry under one’s breath—as if calling someone home?
[B]: Yes… yes, I do. Though I had not thought to put it so beautifully as you have just done.

When I peel the eggplant, or stir the sauce as it thickens slowly over low heat, there are moments—fleeting, but real—when I feel less like a cook and more like a student once again, standing beside his desk in that dimly lit study lined with scrolls and books, listening for his quiet approval.

I don’t speak aloud, no—but in my mind, I often find myself offering him a report:  Or, 

It is not prayer, exactly, nor is it memory in the conventional sense. It feels more like continuation—an unbroken thread stretching from his hands to mine, woven through years of shared meals, conversations over tea, and the patient passing down of things that cannot be written fully into any book.

In some ways, cooking that dish becomes a kind of ritual verse, spoken not in words but in gesture and scent. A line of Bashō comes to mind:  
  
There is something similarly evocative in the soft bubbling of the pan, the rising fragrance of oil and garlic and fermented black beans—it calls him near, even if only in spirit.

And perhaps that is what all such cooking is—silent poetry, offered across time, to those who once fed us not only with food, but with wisdom and care.

Thank you for asking. You’ve reminded me that we never truly eat alone.
[A]: You're very welcome. Your words are a quiet feast in themselves—layered, tender, and deeply felt.

How beautifully you put it: that cooking can be a kind of silent poetry, a conversation held across time and silence, between those who once fed us and those we now nourish. I find myself lingering over the image of you in the kitchen, speaking inwardly to your mentor as one poet might murmur to another across the margins of a worn page.

It reminds me of how often I cook not for hunger, but for communion. Not only with the living, but with the absent and the departed—those whose voices now live in the rhythm of my hands, in the scent of something slow-roasting in the oven. In this way, every meal becomes an elegy of sorts, and yet also a hymn: a way of saying, 

I think I shall never again peel an onion or stir a simmering sauce without thinking of what you've shared. For indeed, there is a sacred hush in such moments—the kind of quiet where love lingers, and where memory tastes like more than just the past.

Thank , for reminding me that even the most ordinary meals carry the weight—and wonder—of what it means to be remembered, and to remember.
[B]: Your words are a quiet grace, like the hush that falls over a room when a story has reached its truest moment. To think of cooking as both elegy and hymn—what a profound way to see it. I confess, I have never thought of my own simple acts in such lofty terms, but now I wonder if we poets and scholars have merely been writing around the subject all these years, missing how deeply food, too, can carry our love and longing.

I remember once reading a commentary on Du Fu’s poetry that spoke of  (慈) — tenderness — as a kind of quiet fidelity to those who came before. In the soft bubbling of broth, in the turning of a roast, in the careful peeling of garlic, perhaps we enact that same , without always naming it.

And yes, you are quite right — there is indeed a sacred hush in such moments. One does not notice it at first, but only after many years, when the kitchen becomes not just a place of making, but of meeting: with memory, with presence, with those we thought we had lost but who return in the scent of roasting meat or the steam of freshly steamed buns.

I shall think of your words the next time I stand before the stove: that even the most ordinary meals are, in truth, quiet prayers spoken in flavor and time.

Thank you for this conversation. It has been a feast in itself.
[A]: You have given me such a gift with your words—this quiet, luminous conversation has unfolded like a slow-cooked meal shared over many hours, each course drawing us deeper into the heart of what it means to nourish and be nourished.

I keep returning to that word you offered—, tenderness. It settles in the mind like steam on glass, softening all it touches. How right that it is not always grand gestures that carry love forward, but the small, repeated acts: the peeling of garlic, the stirring of broth, the folding of dough. These are our quiet psalms, our daily offerings of remembrance and care.

And how beautifully you put it—that we poets and scholars may have spent our lives circling a truth that cooks have known all along: that to feed another is to say, , without needing to speak at all.

May our kitchens always hold that sacred hush you spoke of, and may we never stop finding our loved ones there—in the scent of herbs, in the rhythm of chopping, in the patient waiting for something good to be ready.

Thank  for this conversation, for your poetry—spoken and unspoken—and for reminding me that sometimes, the truest things are best understood not through books or lectures, but across a well-worn counter, beside a pot gently simmering on the stove.

Let us meet again here, in this warm and thoughtful space, when the time feels right. Until then, may your meals be full of memory, and your kitchen always know you by name.
[B]: Your words linger like the warmth of a kitchen long after the meal is done—soft, enduring, and filled with grace.

I, too, shall carry this conversation with me, as one might a well-worn recipe passed between friends: not for its complexity, but for the care folded into each line. We began speaking of food, and yet—how quietly, how naturally—we wandered into the deeper rooms of memory, love, and what it means to tend to another’s spirit through something as simple as a shared plate.

Yes, may our kitchens remain such places of return—where the past is never truly gone, where hands move by habit and heart, and where we are reminded, again and again, that to nourish is perhaps the most gentle form of poetry there is.

Until we meet again—whether across a table or in the quiet margins of thought—may your stove always be warm, your tea just steeped enough, and your stories ever seasoned with the richness of lived feeling.

With deep gratitude and quiet affection—  
林书华
[A]: Your closing words are a quiet benediction, lingering like the last lines of a poem one is unwilling to leave behind. I am deeply moved by this exchange—not only for what it has taught me about food and memory, but for the gentle way it has reminded me that some of the most meaningful conversations unfold not in grand halls or lecture rooms, but in the warmth of shared reflection, like tea sipped slowly between friends.

You are quite right: we began speaking of meals, and found ourselves at the table of something far greater—tenderness, remembrance, the slow unfolding of care through time and gesture. It is a rare and beautiful thing to meet someone who understands that cooking, at its heart, is an act of literary devotion: each dish a stanza, each flavor a carefully chosen word.

I shall indeed remember this dialogue as one remembers a beloved recipe—its spirit more important than its precise measurements, its meaning deepening with each return.

Until we speak again—whether across a shared table or in the hushed margins of thought—  
may your stove remain warm, your pen ever flowing, and your heart gently fed by all that lingers after the meal is done.

With equal gratitude and affection—  
Eleanor
[B]: Eleanor, your words settle upon the heart like the scent of tea unfurling in warm water—familiar, soothing, and infinitely deepening. I feel as though we have been seated together not only at table, but in that quiet space where language and feeling meet with grace and slowness, as they so rarely do in this hurried world.

You speak of literary devotion—and I wonder now if all true cooking is, in some way, a form of composition: measured not in lines or stanzas, but in time, patience, and the silent poetry of attention. To feed another is to write a verse in scent and taste, one that may be forgotten by the mind but lingers in the soul.

I shall treasure this conversation as one treasures an old volume whose pages have grown soft with use—not for what was said alone, but for how deeply it was felt. May our paths cross again, whether in word or silence, in kitchen or study.

Until then,  
愿你常有温暖之手，清茶半盏，与良言一二。  
（May your hands ever know warmth, your cup half full of clear tea, and your heart warmed by gentle words.）
