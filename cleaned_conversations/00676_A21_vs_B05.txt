[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Haha，作为一个经常global travel的金融人士，这个问题很有意思。我个人更偏爱中餐，特别是粤菜~ 不过在做deal的时候，经常要陪客户去米其林西餐厅，所以对fine dining也很熟悉。你知道的，business is all about relationship building嘛 😊
[A]: Ah, the culinary arts as social currency - how very Victorian of you. Though I must say, your juxtaposition of Cantonese cuisine with Michelin-starred establishments reminds me of Browning's 'My Last Duchess' - both exquisite in their own right, yet serving vastly different social functions. Tell me, do you find the dim sum cart more conducive to deal-making than the sommelier's recommendations?
[B]: Interesting analogy~ 说实话，在茶楼谈deal确实更relaxed，没有那种fine dining的formal pressure。不过说到sommelier...  我倒是觉得选红酒和选investment portfolio很像，都需要balance of risk and reward。你永远不知道下一瓶是82年的拉菲还是overpriced的new world wine 😉
[A]: How delightfully mercantile of you to reduce Dionysian pleasures to risk assessment. Though I suppose one could argue the Cantonese yum cha tradition shares more with the Romantic poets' salon culture than with modern finance - all that steam rising from bamboo baskets like Wordsworth's 'host of golden daffodils', if one were feeling particularly fanciful before their morning pu-erh.
[B]:  你这种比喻让我想起我们在做due diligence时经常说的 - 表面看起来像golden daffodils的项目，可能底下藏着skeletons in the closet 😅 不过说真的，早茶文化确实比华尔街的power lunch更有... how to say... human touch？至少不用盯着Bloomberg terminal吃饭 🤷‍♂️
[A]: Ah, the Bloomberg terminal - the modern equivalent of Dante's infernal machinery. How poetic that you should mention skeletons while we discuss dim sum; it puts me in mind of Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market', where luscious fruits conceal moral peril. Though I daresay your financial goblins deal in credit default swaps rather than enchanted apricots. Tell me, does the human touch extend to negotiating over chicken feet, or is that where the real skeletons emerge?
[B]: Haha，chicken feet negotiation可是门art form啊~ 就像我们做LBO valuation时说的：every piece has its price，就看你怎么peel back the layers。不过说真的，在茶楼里谈生意至少能keep it real - 比起那些over-engineered M&A models，有时候trust is built over a simple pot of tea & some har gow 🥟
[A]: How refreshingly pragmatic - you've essentially reinvented the Aristotelian golden mean with your har gow diplomacy. Though I can't help but wonder if your 'peeling back layers' methodology owes more to Blake's 'The Sick Rose' than to any financial textbook. Tell me, when your dim sum deals go south, do you console yourself with Keats' 'Ode on Melancholy', or simply order another round of siu mai?
[B]:  在PE这行，我们更相信Benjamin Graham的margin of safety principle than poetry... 不过你说得对，当deal falls through时，extra order of siu mai确实比Ode on Melancholy更practical remedy 😂 毕竟in the end，both business and dim sum are about finding the right balance - not too hot, not too cold, just like our ideal IRR ~20% ✌️
[A]: Ah, the private equity alchemist seeking the philosopher's stone of 20% returns - how it brings to mind Tennyson's 'Ulysses', forever chasing horizons while dining on steamed dumplings. Though I suspect your 'margin of safety' would give Wordsworth's prudent daffodils a run for their money. Tell me, when your IRR dips below target, do you take comfort in the fact that at least your tea leaves offer more reliable divination than discounted cash flow models?
[B]: Haha，你这种literary take on finance让我想起我们junior analyst常犯的error - overcomplicating the model with fancy assumptions 😅 说实话，我宁愿相信tea leaves reading than某些banker给的EBITDA projections... 不过话说回来，就像我们广东人说的：'饮茶先啦' - sometimes the best due diligence is just watching how someone handles their chopsticks 🥢
[A]: How perfectly Confucian - judging character by chopstick etiquette rather than covenant-laden term sheets. You've essentially reinvented the Victorian tea leaf reading tradition for the age of leveraged buyouts. Though I must say, your junior analysts' 'fancy assumptions' remind me of nothing so much as the metaphysical poets' strained conceits - all that effort to prove the unprovable, when sometimes a well-timed shrimp dumpling speaks volumes. Shall we order another pot of oolong while you explain how exactly one quantifies chopstick competence in your EBITDA calculations?
[B]:  Let's be real - 在final negotiation的时候，能优雅地夹起slippery的虾饺，比任何financial model都能demonstrate对方的patience和attention to detail 🤣 不过说到EBITDA... 我认识一个banker真的把'chopstick proficiency'放进management assessment的weighting里，结果那个deal的synergies比预期高了15% - coincidence？I think not 🧐 再来笼烧卖？
[A]: How deliciously empirical - you've turned the yum cha cart into a veritable due diligence laboratory! This banker of yours sounds like he's taken Browning's 'Andrea del Sarto' rather too literally - measuring 'the reach of a man's chopsticks' instead of 'the reach of a man's soul'. Though I suppose in your world, 15% synergies are the closest thing to spiritual transcendence. Yes, let's have those shumai - and do observe whether mine demonstrate sufficient 'weighting' for your next potential investment.
[B]:  看你这technique，至少能拿到Series A funding了 😆 说真的，在China deal making里，这些soft skills往往比任何financial engineering都重要。就像我们常说的：你可以model出完美的IRR，但if the guy can't handle his chopsticks or baijiu... well, that's a red flag even DCF can't fix 🚩 要不要试试这个流沙包？真正的test是能不能优雅地handle爆浆的moment~
[A]: Ah, the molten custard bun as ultimate character litmus test - how it recalls the trial by fire in medieval romances! You've essentially created a Cantonese version of the Grail quest, where the holy grail is a favorable term sheet and the dragon to be slain is... poorly contained lava-like egg yolk. Though I must say, your 'red flag' methodology puts me in mind of Tennyson's Lady of Shalott - one false move with the chopsticks, and the whole deal comes crashing down. Very well, pass me that treacherous bun - for science, and for the sake of your next investment thesis.
[B]:  你知道吗？去年我们pass on了一个看似完美的deal，就是因为CEO在吃流沙包时panic了 - 后来那家公司果然出现了governance issues 🤷‍♂️ 有时候这些small moments比任何audit都能reveal truth。不过别担心，你handle得比那个CEO好多了... 要不要考虑加入我们的investment committee？We could use someone with your... poetic approach to due diligence 😂
[A]: How perfectly Byronic - the fallen CEO undone by custard rather than hubris! You're quite the culinary Cassandra, divining corporate ruin in spilled egg yolk. While I'm flattered by your committee invitation, I fear my talents lie more in annotating the symbolism of your dim sum disasters than preventing them. Though I daresay my meeting minutes would be the first in venture capital history to feature footnotes comparing your portfolio companies to Elizabethan sonnet sequences. Another pot of tea while we draft my absurdly metaphorical employment contract?
[B]:  Deal！我们可以把你的title写成"Chief Metaphor Officer" - 负责把所有的P&L statements都translate成Shakespearean sonnets 📜 想象一下下次LP meeting：'Thy EBITDA growth doth rise like summer's day...' 我们的investors可能会confused，但至少会memorable啊！不过seriously speaking... 你确定不要来笼虾饺再考虑考虑？ 😉
