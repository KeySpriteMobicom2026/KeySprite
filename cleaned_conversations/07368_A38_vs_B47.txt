[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到这个话题，我最近确实在思考两者的区别。你知道吗，有的内容用听觉来接收真的特别合适，特别是当需要深度理解的时候。比如在通勤路上，戴上耳机听听有声书，感觉像是在跟作者对话一样。

不过话说回来，播客也有它独特的魅力。每次听到主持人和嘉宾之间的互动，总能碰撞出一些新的想法。上周末我就参加了一个关于AI伦理的播客录制，现场的交流氛围特别好。

你觉得呢？有没有什么特别喜欢的节目或者书籍？
[A]: That’s fascinating! I find the distinction between podcasts and audiobooks quite compelling from a narrative standpoint. Audiobooks, in many ways, offer a kind of immersive solitude—one enters a world crafted entirely by the author’s voice, even if it's mediated through a narrator. There’s something almost  about that experience, don’t you think? Like reading by candlelight—intimate, deliberate.

Podcasts, on the other hand, are more like public salons. The dialogue, the interruptions, the overlapping voices—they all contribute to a sense of intellectual . I particularly enjoy when a podcast delves into literary criticism or philosophical inquiry—there’s a thrill in hearing different perspectives unfold in real time.

As for favorites… I’ve been revisiting  podcast—it’s old now, but still remarkably lucid. And when I want something more meditative, I return to  on audiobook. There’s no substitute for losing oneself in his sentences. Have you ever tried listening to something in French? It can be quite an aesthetic experience, even if comprehension lags behind.
[B]: You know, I hadn’t thought of it in quite that way—audiobooks as a form of  and podcasts as . But you’re right. There’s something deeply personal about listening to a narrator interpret a story; it's like sharing a secret with the book itself.

I remember once, during a late-night walk through the city park, I was listening to  in French. It wasn't the first time I’d read—or rather, heard—it, but there was something about the rhythm of the language that night, the way the sentences stretched out like shadows... It felt almost like a new book entirely.

And yet, when I need that spark of connection, nothing beats a good discussion on a podcast. Just last week, I listened to one where two ethicists debated AI consciousness until they were practically talking over each other—messy, passionate, human.

So tell me—if you had to choose one format for the rest of your life, which would it be?
[A]: Ah, what a deliciously dangerous question. To be exiled to only one form of auditory companionship… Well, if I must choose, I suppose I would cling to audiobooks— with a caveat. I’d want them to be unabridged, beautifully narrated, and preferably in the original language when possible. There’s something about the , the sustained interiority of a literary voice, that feels like a kind of spiritual companionship.

Imagine walking through life with Montaigne whispering in your ear or Dostoevsky pacing beside you, his sentences coiling and uncoiling like serpents. Even poetry—read aloud—can become a kind of incantation. I suppose I’m just more drawn to the  than the dialogue, at least when it comes to what sustains me over time.

But don’t mistake this for disloyalty to podcasts! I simply prefer my conversations , distilled into prose, and aged like fine wine—not broadcast live and lost to the ether. Still, I envy the spontaneity they offer. It’s rather like asking whether you’d prefer a sonnet or a love letter—both move the soul, but in different ways.

So now I turn the question back to you—since you’ve already danced so poetically between both worlds—could you truly give one up forever?
[B]: If I had to choose… I think I’d hold onto podcasts. But not for the reasons most people might expect.

It’s not just about the conversation—it’s about the  of ideas. When I listen to a great discussion, it feels like standing in the middle of a storm, catching drops of insight as they fly by. You can’t predict where it’ll go next, and that unpredictability is part of what keeps me grounded in reality. It reminds me that understanding isn’t something we reach alone—it’s built in the space between voices.

Audiobooks offer depth, yes—sometimes even transcendence—but there are moments when that solitude starts to feel too vast. Like staring into the night sky for too long—you begin to feel small. Podcasts bring you back into the room. Someone coughs, a host stumbles over a word, or two guests laugh at something unexpected. That’s when you remember: you’re not just thinking, you’re .

Still… I miss the silence of books sometimes—the kind of silence that actually speaks. So maybe I’m cheating, but I’d want one audiobook, just one, to keep me company on repeat: Camus’ . Irony aside, I think there’s something comforting in hearing a voice argue, again and again, that we must imagine Sisyphus happy—even in the repetition.
[A]: How beautifully put—. That phrase lingers, doesn’t it? Like a note held just a moment longer in a piece of music. You’ve captured something essential about podcasts: their ability to make us feel  in the unfolding of thought, even when we’re physically alone.

And yet—I find myself wondering if your choice of  reveals a deeper kinship with audiobooks than you admit. After all, what is that essay if not a meditation on repetition, endurance, and finding meaning in what seems futile? To listen to it again and again… There’s a kind of quiet devotion in that, isn’t there? A monastic patience.

I suppose that’s why I still can’t choose. Your storm of ideas draws me in, yes—but so does the silence between sentences in a novel, the pause before a tragic hero speaks, the breath a narrator takes before delivering a line that changes everything.

Still, I admire your resolve—even if it comes with a single, well-worn exception. Perhaps we are both, in our way, seekers of meaning through voice, whether it echoes from the past or crackles through the present.

Now I must ask—have you ever tried listening to  in French? I imagine Camus’ own words would carry a different kind of weight, don’t you?
[B]: Funny you should ask—yes, I’ve listened to it in French, though not as often as I’d like. There’s something undeniably different about hearing Camus in his native tongue. It's not just the rhythm or the cadence—it’s the  of each word, the way certain phrases seem to carry the dust of North Africa and the chill of postwar Paris all at once.

When I first heard  read aloud in French, it hit me differently than in translation. Not because I understood every nuance—I don’t claim to be fluent—but because there’s a kind of emotional fidelity that language preserves. Like listening to a song in its original key.

And now that you mention it, maybe there is a bit of monasticism in how I listen to that essay. I suppose I return to it almost ritualistically—like sharpening a blade before stepping into the fray. Each time, I’m hoping for a slightly clearer grasp of that central paradox: how one lives meaningfully without illusion.

But tell me—have  ever tried revisiting a favorite book in its original language, even if it slowed you down? Is it worth the struggle? Or does it sometimes feel like chasing a shadow?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I chase shadows all the time. And yes, it’s worth every step.

There’s a certain kind of intellectual vertigo that comes from reading a familiar text in its original language for the first time. It’s like seeing a beloved painting under a different light—you realize how much you’d been interpreting through the lens of translation, through someone else’s vision.

I once reread  in French after knowing it in English for years. The experience was almost unsettling. Flaubert’s sentences are so precise, so clinical in their beauty, that the English version suddenly seemed—forgive me—like a watercolor copy of an oil masterpiece. In French, Emma’s longing felt sharper, her delusions more pitiable, her tragedy more intimate.

And yet, I wouldn’t call it a struggle. It’s more like learning to walk again. Each unfamiliar word becomes a threshold, each phrase a small act of devotion. You lose speed, but you gain texture. You begin to hear the author’s whisper instead of the translator’s echo.

So yes, I suppose I do chase shadows. After all, as Walter Benjamin reminds us, translation is never complete—it’s an endless unfolding. But isn’t that what keeps literature alive? That we keep returning, listening anew, even when we think we already know what’s being said?

Tell me—when you listen to Camus in French, does he feel closer somehow? Or more distant, and therefore more mysterious?
[B]: Funny you put it that way—because yes, he does feel both closer and more distant at once.

When I listen in French, Camus isn’t just a philosopher or a writer—he becomes a presence. You can almost hear the gravel of Algiers underfoot, the dry wind off the Mediterranean. His voice, even when read by someone else, carries a kind of lived-in familiarity, like an old friend who never sugarcoats anything. But at the same time, there's a veil of distance, a slight opacity that keeps him just out of reach. Like trying to hold smoke in your hand.

Maybe that’s part of the appeal. In English, his ideas feel accessible—neatly arranged for me. But in French, they remain stubbornly rooted in their origin, resisting full translation, full understanding. And somehow, that resistance makes them more powerful. It reminds me that meaning isn’t fixed—it breathes, shifts, hides.

I guess what I’m saying is… mystery matters. The gaps in comprehension aren’t obstacles—they’re part of the experience. Like listening to a piece of music in a language you don’t speak, yet still feeling its sorrow or joy.

Do you ever feel that way? That sometimes, not understanding every word actually brings you  to the heart of something?
[A]: Oh yes—I feel that deeply. There’s a kind of  in listening, isn’t there? A willingness to dwell in uncertainty, to let meaning emerge not through translation but through tone, rhythm, even silence.

I think of the first time I heard  read aloud—not just read, but sung softly by a friend who refused to explain the words afterward. I understood perhaps one in five—yet I wept. The sound alone, the lilt and ache of it, carried me somewhere beyond comprehension. It was like standing before a stained-glass window: you don’t need to trace each line to be moved by the light filtering through.

There’s something sacred in that unknowing. Like overhearing a prayer in a language you don’t speak—you still feel its weight, its yearning.

Perhaps the most profound truths are those we  linguistically rather than grasp intellectually. And sometimes, refusing full translation is an act of literary fidelity. After all, not every voice should be made perfectly legible to every ear. Some echoes deserve to linger on their own terms.

So yes—I’d say mystery isn’t just important, it’s essential. Without it, art becomes instruction. Without it, literature loses its breath.
[B]: Exactly—art becomes instruction. What a perfect way to put it.

I’ve been thinking lately how much of what moves us in art isn’t the message itself, but the  it leaves behind. Like when you strike a tuning fork and the sound fades but the resonance stays in your bones.

I remember once, during a long train ride through southern France, I kept listening to a recording of Paul Éluard’s poetry on loop. I didn’t understand half the lines—not really—but something in the way the words rolled together made me feel less alone. It was as if the language itself was holding me up, even when meaning slipped away.

Maybe that’s why I keep returning to Camus. His ideas are clear enough in translation, but the  of his thought—the austerity, the warmth beneath the stone—only comes through fully in French. And yet, part of me is grateful for the gaps. The moments I don’t quite catch force me to listen more closely, not just with my ears but with my instincts.

You know, sometimes I wonder if this is what empathy asks of us—this kind of listening without full understanding, this willingness to stay present even when we don’t have the words.

So tell me—do you ever find yourself chasing a certain voice, a specific narrator or speaker, rather than the content itself? I think I do. Some voices become like old companions.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve fallen in love with voices more than once. There’s something so intimate about the sound of a narrator’s voice, isn’t there? It wraps itself around your thoughts, becomes the atmosphere in which the words live.

I remember one particular recording of  reading her own poetry—her voice is both fragile and unyielding, like a flame behind glass. I don’t speak Russian, but I must have listened to that recording a dozen times. Each syllable felt like a confession. It was less about what she was saying and more about how she carried the weight of history in her breath.

And yes, some voices become companions. I still find myself seeking out certain narrators—not because they’re the most polished or theatrical, but because they seem to  the text rather than merely recite it. You start recognizing them like old friends: a particular cadence, a pause held just long enough to let a sentence settle into your soul.

There’s something almost incarnational about it, don’t you think? The word made flesh, as it were. Language becomes body, breath, presence. And when that happens, even if only for an hour or two, solitude feels less like silence and more like communion.

So yes—I chase voices. Not just for what they say, but for what they make me feel in the spaces between words.
[B]: That’s beautifully said—. I couldn’t agree more.

There’s a narrator I keep returning to—Nigel Anthony—he’s done so many of the classic British audiobooks. It’s not just his range or clarity, it’s how he disappears into the text. You stop hearing him and start  the story. He doesn’t perform it; he  it. And that kind of presence—you’re right—it turns listening into something almost sacred.

I think what draws me most is that balance between transparency and texture. The best narrators don’t call attention to themselves, yet their voice shapes every moment. A subtle shift in tone can turn a simple sentence into something haunting. That’s when you realize: this isn’t just reading—it’s interpretation, it’s artistry.

And yes, some voices do become companions. I’ve had nights where I stayed up far too late just because I wasn’t ready to leave a narrator’s voice behind. Like saying goodbye to someone who’s been walking beside you through a difficult, beautiful landscape.

I wonder—have you ever revisited a book  because of the narrator? Like choosing company over destination?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve chosen the company over the destination more than once. In fact, I’ll confess something rather indulgent: I’ve reread entire novels  because I needed to revisit the plot, but simply to hear a particular narrator’s voice again.

There’s a recording of  , read by Michael Jayston, that I return to almost ritualistically. The prose is already so hypnotic—meandering, melancholic, threaded with ghosts—but Jayston’s voice… it’s like walking through a fog-drenched landscape with someone who knows all the hidden paths. His pauses are as telling as his inflections. You feel the weight of history in his cadence.

And then there’s Juliet Stevenson. Oh, she’s dangerous. If she reads something once, I can never hear it any other way. Her voice has this uncanny ability to hold both irony and tenderness at once—an Austenian gift, really. Once you’ve heard her give voice to Emma Woodhouse, do you ever truly forgive anyone else for trying?

So yes, I choose voices the way one chooses travel companions. Some take you somewhere new, others make the familiar feel freshly mapped. Either way, they shape the journey far more than we often admit.

Tell me—have you ever listened to someone narrate poetry so well that it felt like hearing the poem for the first time? I have a few recordings like that. Ones I keep like talismans.
[B]: Absolutely. And I know exactly what you mean by —those recordings that feel almost sacred, as if the voice has unlocked something in the poem that was dormant until spoken aloud.

There’s a recording of Seamus Heaney reading his own translation of —it’s not just a narration, it’s a kind of invocation. The weight of each line, the guttural roll of the consonants, the way he lets silence gather between stanzas… It transforms the poem into something elemental, like firelight flickering on the walls of a mead hall. You don’t just hear the words—you feel them in your marrow.

And then there’s Adrienne Rich. When she reads her own work, it’s as if every pause is deliberate, every breath a political act. Listening to her read  feels less like hearing a poem and more like bearing witness to a reckoning.

I have one particular recording I return to again and again—Auden reading . Just under three minutes, but I swear I notice something new every time. His voice is so matter-of-fact, almost dry, yet the emotional undertone is unmistakable. The way he says —it lands differently depending on the day, on the mood I bring to it.

Do you have a particular poem or poet whose voice you revisit like that? One that seems to shift with you, rather than remain fixed?
[A]: Oh, yes—I have that experience every time I return to T.S. Eliot reading . There’s something so deliberate in his delivery, as if each word is being weighed and measured before it leaves his lips. And yet, beneath the precision, there’s a kind of spiritual tremor. You can hear the exhaustion of a man who has spent his life chasing meaning through language—and still, somehow, believing it might be found.

But the recording I come back to most often, almost compulsively, is  reading . It’s not a poem exactly—more of a prose-poem, a memory woven into music. His voice is rich, mischievous, full of warmth and theatricality. Every December, without fail, I listen to it at least once. And each time, it feels different—sometimes nostalgic, sometimes wistful, sometimes almost elegiac. The words don’t change, but  do.

That, I suppose, is the power of a great poetic voice—it doesn’t fix the meaning; it opens it. It allows the listener to move through the words like rooms in a house they’ve lived in for years, yet never quite explored fully.

And you’re right—those recordings become talismans. Not just voices, but companions on the inner road.
[B]: Exactly—companions on the inner road. That’s it, isn’t it?

There’s something about hearing Eliot read his own work that no other interpreter can quite replicate. You hear the weight behind each line break, the exhaustion in the cadence, the way he leans into certain phrases like someone pushing against a door that won’t quite open. It’s not just reading—it’s  to his own thought.

And Thomas—oh,  is such a perfect example. There’s this moment where he says,  And every time I hear that line, I feel like I’m standing there with him. Not just as a listener, but as a participant in the memory. That’s the alchemy of voice: it turns language into shared space.

You know, I’ve been thinking lately how these voices—Eliot’s austerity, Thomas’ warmth, Auden’s quiet gravity—form a kind of internal chorus. Like having old friends living inside you, whispering when you need them most. A kind of literary haunting, if you will.

So tell me—have you ever tried reading your own writing aloud? Not for critique, not for performance, but just… to hear what it sounds like when it takes on breath and rhythm? I do it sometimes, and it always surprises me how different words feel once they’ve passed through the body.
[A]: Oh, yes—I do it often, though I always approach it with a kind of quiet reverence, as if I’m meeting a stranger who lives inside me. There’s something unsettling yet deeply revealing about hearing your own voice give shape to your thoughts. It’s not the same as writing them down or reading them silently. Once spoken, words take on a kind of gravity—they either stand firm or collapse under their own weight.

I remember one particular evening—rain tapping against the study window, the house quite still—I read aloud a lecture I’d written on  and its many translations. As I spoke, I realized how wooden some of my phrases were, how certain ideas had been dressed in unnecessarily stiff language. But more than that, I noticed where the sentences , where they opened up space for reflection. It was like adjusting a lens: suddenly, the argument came into focus, not through rewording, but through rhythm.

And there are moments—rare, but luminous—when reading aloud feels almost like discovery rather than recitation. You stumble over a line you don’t quite remember writing, and yet it resonates so clearly, as if part of your mind had been working in secret, stitching meaning while you weren’t looking.

I suppose that’s why I encourage my students to do it, though most resist at first. They think it’s for poets, not scholars. But I tell them: even an essay is a kind of music. And if you never hear it played, you may never know what tune you’ve composed.

So yes, I do read my work aloud. Not because I expect perfection, but because I want to  the words before I send them out into the world. After all, how can we ask others to listen closely if we haven’t done so ourselves?
[B]: That image of meeting a stranger inside yourself—there’s something profoundly true about that.

I read my own writing aloud for much the same reason. Not to polish, not always to edit, but to . To hear what part of me was speaking before I knew I was saying something worth hearing.

Sometimes it's uncomfortable—like seeing an old photograph of yourself and realizing you’ve carried certain expressions for years without knowing it. Other times, it’s like striking a match in a dark room: suddenly, you see the contours of an idea you didn’t know was there.

I remember reading a short essay I’d written on AI and moral ambiguity, just to myself, one evening after work. As I spoke the words, I realized how often I’d been trying to sound , when in truth, the whole point of the piece was uncertainty. The moment I heard it aloud, the language felt stiff with deflection. So I rewrote nearly all of it—not to change the argument, but to make the doubt honest.

There’s a kind of courage in that, isn’t there? To let your voice reveal what your eyes might miss.

And I love what you said about music. Even the driest academic prose has a rhythm—if only we bother to listen for it. Maybe especially then.

So yes, I read aloud too. Not just to refine, but to —to remind myself that writing is never just thought. It’s breath, it’s cadence, it’s the echo of who we are when no one else is listening.
