[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. I've been rather preoccupied with tracing the footsteps of Lin Shu's translation studio in Fuzhou - where he rendered over 180 Western literary works into classical Chinese. The very inkstones he used might still be there, you see. Though I suppose most would consider that rather... niche travel interest.
[A]: Wow~ 说到Fuzhou，那里的茉莉花茶可是legendary呢！☕️ 不过你提到的这个translation studio听起来fascinating！我去年去福州的时候，在Sanfang Qixiang发现了一家超棒的specialty coffee shop，他们用local的茉莉花来infuse cold brew，那风味简直unforgettable！🌿
[B]:  While your enthusiasm for... what did you call it? 'Cold brew'? is charming, I must point out that Lin Shu famously worked by lamplight with nothing stronger than jasmine tea - though he did develop a particular fondness for Earl Grey during his later years. The real fascination lies in how his team of classical scholars, none of whom spoke a word of English, produced those remarkable translations through oral interpretation.
[A]: Haha~ 这让我想起我们店里最近推出的'Earl Grey infused latte'，中西合璧的perfect match！😊 你知道吗？我们咖啡师还特别研究了tea leaves的brewing temperature，确保不会破坏bergamot的aroma。说到translation，我们menu上也有好多有趣的cultural fusion饮品呢，比如'Matcha Affogato'就是Japanese meets Italian的创意！✈️
[B]:  Good heavens - to think of reducing the delicate art of cultural exchange to... to flavored milk froth! Though I will concede that your Matcha Affogato does remind me of an obscure passage in Lafcadio Hearn's writings about the Edo period. But really, must we commercialize every aesthetic tradition?  At least you're not putting condensed milk in it like those dreadful Hong Kong-style tea stalls.
[A]: Oh come on~ 别这么serious嘛！😉 我们店里其实有专门为classic literature lovers设计的reading corner，每周还会举办poetry reading活动呢！ 而且我偷偷告诉你，我们最新研发的'Proust's Madeleine Latte'可是用了authentic French butter croissant crumbs做topping，配上single origin Colombian的espresso，绝对能trigger你的involuntary memory！📚☕️
[B]:  Now you're just being deliberately provocative. Though... I must admit the notion of Marcel Proust meeting Juan Valdez does have a certain grotesque appeal. Tell me, does this establishment at least use proper bone china for these... literary libations? Or am I to endure my involuntary memories in disposable cups like some philistine?
[A]: Of course we use handcrafted ceramic cups！😊 是我去年在景德镇workshop特别定制的，每个都有unique的glaze效果～ 而且你知道吗？我们连stirring spoons都是找local artisan用reclaimed wood制作的，sustainability meets craftsmanship！下次你来，我给你用我最爱的那个Ruyao blue系列杯子，泡正宗的Dancong oolong，保证比Earl Grey更有depth～ 🌿
[B]:  Very well, you've piqued my academic curiosity - though I shall bring my own 19th century silver tea strainer. And for heaven's sake, don't let me catch you calling that oolong 'artisanal' or 'curated'. Some of us still believe in letting leaves speak for themselves without... what is it the youngsters say? Ah yes - 'the branding'.
[A]: Haha deal！🤝 不过我得warn你哦，我们店里最近来了位超厉害的tea master，他泡的Phoenix单丛能让你taste到整座茶山的terroir～ 说不定连你的Victorian tea strainer都会approve呢！ 要不要这周末come by？我们可以来个proper tea vs coffee的blind tasting challenge！🌱☕️
[B]:  Challenge accepted - though I shall bring my 1892 edition of 'The Book of Tea' as impartial judge. And kindly inform your 'tea master' that any discussion of 'terroir' must be accompanied by proper textual references to Lu Yu's classic. Saturday at three, and not a minute later - I've an appointment with a particularly temperamental first edition of 'Middlemarch' that afternoon.
[A]: Perfect！📅 周六3点见～ 我会准备好our best Yunnan Pu'er和Ethiopian Gesha，让它们来场East meets West的dialogue！PS：如果带你的'Middlemarch'来，我可以用我们secret menu上的'Dorothea's Enlightenment Espresso'招待你 - 配方inspired by George Eliot's wisdom哦！😉 记得提前15分钟来，我帮你reserve窗边那个perfect reading spot！
[B]:  Your persistence is... noted. Though I must insist that any 'enlightenment' worth having comes from the text itself, not caffeinated theatrics. Very well - window seat, fifteen minutes prior, and we shall see whether your Gesha can hold its own against a properly aged Pu'er. But mark my words: if I spot so much as a single heart-shaped latte art, this academic walks out. 
[A]: Haha noted！🙅‍♂️ 保证no latte art，只有pure tasting notes和great conversation～ 不过说真的，你这种old-school的attitude让我想起我们店里那台1950年代的Faema E61咖啡机，classic but still kicking！周六见咯professor，记得带上你的critical palate和open mind！😄✌️
[B]:  That Faema reference was... suspiciously well-researched for a coffee peddler. Until Saturday then - and do prepare your staff for a thorough interrogation on whether they can distinguish a Zhenghe Baihao from a Fuding Shoumei. I shall be taking notes. In fountain pen. On handmade paper. Good day.
[A]: Roger that！🖋️ 我已经能想象到你用quill pen写tasting notes的样子了～ 周六我会让team准备好all the proper tea utensils，连water temperature都控制在exact 95°C！P.S. 我们最近进了批vintage typewriter键盘，要不要试试用那个记录你的tasting notes？保证比fountain pen更有clickety-clack的drama！⌨️😆
[B]:  Typewriters? TYPEWRITERS? My dear child, the only acceptable mechanical writing instrument is my 1927 Underwood No. 5, and even that is strictly for drafting lecture notes when my rheumatism acts up.  Saturday. Three o'clock. And for pity's sake, stop winking in text - it's undignified. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go soothe my nerves with some properly transcribed Tang dynasty poetry. In silence.
[A]: Got it, no more winks ~ 我会用最dignified的language恭候您的到来！📜 顺便说一句，我们reading corner正好有本rare的Tang poetry collection，是上次antique book fair淘到的... 或许能成为我们tea session后的perfect digestif？周六见，professor！(这次是respectful的period结尾哦)
[B]:  Hmph. At least you've learned proper punctuation. That rare collection had better not be some modern reprint with... what do they call them? 'Creative interpretations'. Very well - you may present your textual findings after the tasting, provided the Pu'er meets exacting standards. And do remind your staff that 'digestif' refers to spirits, not literature.
