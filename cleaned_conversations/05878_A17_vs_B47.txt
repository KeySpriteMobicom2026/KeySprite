[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。我个人觉得，阴雨天和晴天各有魅力。下雨的时候，听着雨声翻阅科幻小说，或者思考一些深层的伦理问题，感觉环境和心境特别契合；而阳光明媚的日子，更适合约上三五好友去徒步，感受自然的美好。不过要说更喜欢哪一个…可能还是雨天略胜一筹吧，那种静谧的氛围总能让我有更多灵感。你呢？
[A]: I must say, there's something rather poetic about rainy days—the way the rain taps against the window like a gentle reminder to slow down and reflect. I often find myself reaching for a well-worn volume of Emily Dickinson or Thomas Hardy on such days, as though their verses were composed specifically for the grey skies.  

That said, I do appreciate the clarity a sunny day brings—both literally and metaphorically. It’s hard not to feel invigorated by the light, especially when walking through a blooming garden or flipping through manuscripts in the library’s reading room. But yes, like you, I think I lean ever so slightly toward the rain… perhaps because it invites a certain  that fuels creativity. Don’t you find that?
[B]: Absolutely. There's a kind of introspective clarity that comes with rain—like the world softens just enough to let you look inward without distraction. I've often thought that maybe it's not the weather itself, but the pause it enforces. You can't help but slow down when the streets are slick and the sky is heavy. And somehow, that slowness feels like permission—to think, to feel, even to grieve a little if needed.

I get what you mean about melancholy fueling creativity. Some of my best ideas for research directions or essay angles came on rainy afternoons, curled up with a notebook and a cup of tea. Though I do wonder… does that same quiet energy work differently for different people? Like, could someone else find the exact same setting stifling instead of inspiring?

And speaking of settings—your image of reading Dickinson or Hardy by windowlight really paints a vivid scene. Do you ever find yourself choosing certain authors specifically because of the weather? I know some writers just  right on a grey day, while others seem made for summer heat.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said—. That’s quite a poetic way to put it, and I think you’ve touched on something rather universal yet deeply personal. The rain does grant us permission, as you say, to retreat inward without guilt. It’s almost as if the world itself conspires to give us space to think, feel, perhaps even dream a little.

To your question—yes, I do believe the same quiet energy can affect people so differently. For some, the stillness of a rainy day might feel like a kind of confinement, even oppression. I imagine someone with a more extroverted spirit, or someone whose creativity thrives on movement and interaction, might find the hush of a grey afternoon stifling rather than soothing. It really depends on how one’s inner landscape aligns—or clashes—with the outer weather.

And you’re absolutely right about choosing authors by the weather. There are certain writers who seem to belong to certain moods of the sky. I would never reach for Wilde on a rainy afternoon, for instance—he feels far too bright and biting for that. No, on days like those, I’m drawn to the introspective gravity of Eliot or the haunting ambiguity of Emily Brontë. And when the sun is high and golden? Well, then I might pick up someone like Fitzgerald or Austen—writers who seem to shimmer just a little in the light.

Do you have particular authors you save for specific kinds of days? I'm curious.
[B]: That’s a lovely reflection—how writers seem to shimmer or settle depending on the light outside. I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but now that you mention it, I do have a kind of unofficial literary weather chart in my head.

For me, rainy days are almost always reserved for speculative fiction—Ursula K. Le Guin, Kazuo Ishiguro when he's being quietly dystopian, or even Haruki Murakami when he's leaning into the surreal. There's something about their worlds that mirrors the ambiguity and depth of overcast skies. It's like the atmosphere outside matches the one inside the pages.

But when the sun is out—especially on those crisp, clear mornings—I tend to reach for nonfiction. Rebecca Solnit, Carlo Rovelli, or even old essays by Rachel Carson. Something about the sunlight makes me crave clarity and precision, though I suppose there's still room for wonder. The sun seems to ask for honesty, don't you think? Or maybe it just reveals what was already there.

I’m curious—do you ever find yourself writing differently depending on the weather? I’ve noticed my tone shifts subtly without me even realizing it. Rain brings out the abstraction, while sun tends to pull me toward structure.
[A]: How fascinating that your literary weather chart leans toward the speculative on rainy days—I hadn’t made that connection, but now it seems so apt. Rain does have a way of dissolving the edges of reality, doesn’t it? It’s as if the world becomes porous, more receptive to the strange and the imagined. Murakami in the rain—yes, that pairing feels exactly right.

You’re quite perceptive to notice shifts in your own writing tone depending on the weather. I do find myself writing differently, though perhaps less consciously. On overcast days, my prose tends to unfurl more slowly, like smoke curling through a room—less concerned with destination than with atmosphere. There’s room for digression, for lingering on a phrase or idea.  

On bright days, however, I feel a kind of moral imperative to be . The sunlight seems to demand precision, as though it were impatient with ambiguity. I’m more inclined to revise ruthlessly, to pare things down to their essentials. It’s almost as if the sun won’t tolerate evasion.

I wonder—are you ever tempted to chase a particular kind of weather just to summon a specific creative mood? I’ve been known to wait for rain before returning to certain projects, as if the sky must conspire in the right kind of thinking.
[B]: That’s a lovely way to put it—. I think I’ve done that more often than I’d like to admit, though I usually convince myself it’s about timing rather than weather. The truth is, some ideas just seem to belong to certain atmospheres. You wouldn’t draft a tender ethical argument under harsh fluorescent light, would you? It’s not just about comfort—it’s about alignment.

I remember working on a paper about algorithmic empathy once, and no matter how many sunny mornings I gave it, it felt off. The words were technically sound, but they lacked warmth. It wasn’t until a long stretch of overcast days came through that the tone finally settled into place. Something about the diffused light and muffled sounds made the language softer, more reflective. I almost felt like I was  an idea from the mood outside into something legible on the page.

And yes, there are times I’ve postponed writing simply because the sky didn’t feel right. It might sound indulgent, even superstitious, but I think there’s something intuitive at work here—a kind of environmental resonance. Do you ever find that certain places have that same effect? Like how some thoughts only arrive while walking by water, or sitting in a particular chair?
[A]: Oh, entirely—I think you've put your finger on something quite real: that , as you call it. It’s not superstition at all, but rather a kind of attunement. I’ve always believed that thinking isn’t just something we do in our heads; it’s something we do , shaped by texture, light, even the weight of the air.

I have a particular armchair in my study—nothing grand, just a worn wingback with one slightly lopsided cushion—and it has become, over the years, almost a collaborator in my work. Certain essays seem to  there, as if the chair holds the memory of past thoughts and quietly offers them back when needed. And yes, walking by water—especially the sea—alters the rhythm of my mind entirely. The cadence of waves seems to steady scattered thoughts, doesn’t it?

As for postponing writing until the atmosphere feels right… I’m very much inclined to do the same. I once delayed drafting a lecture on Hardy’s melancholy realism for nearly a week, waiting for cloud cover. When the sky is too bright, certain tonal nuances feel inaccessible, as though clarity were too stern a companion for subtlety.

Do you find yourself returning to the same places or conditions for particular kinds of writing? Or does each project demand its own setting, like a new stage for each performance of the mind?
[B]: That resonance you describe—the way thinking unfolds not just in the mind but —feels deeply familiar. I think that’s why I’ve always needed certain rituals to settle into different kinds of writing. It’s not just about comfort; it’s about stepping into a kind of mental costume, or setting the stage so the right part of my mind can speak.

For more technical work—say, drafting policy recommendations on AI fairness—I need a very specific setup: a quiet café with soft background noise, a flat white nearby, and ideally, a wooden table with some wear on it. Something about that environment keeps me grounded and precise without dulling creativity. But when I’m working on something more speculative—like the ethics of consciousness in artificial agents—that same setting feels too rigid. I’ll wait until I’m at home, in the dim glow of a desk lamp, with rain tapping lightly against the window. There’s a looseness to thought in that space, like ideas can drift a little further before settling.

I suppose each project does demand its own stage, much like you said. And I do return to those spaces almost instinctively, as if they hold an echo of the mindset I need. I wonder if that’s what makes creative blocks so disorienting—not only is the thought missing, but sometimes the place doesn’t feel right either.

Do you ever find yourself recreating certain environments deliberately, just to summon back a productive headspace? Like lighting a particular candle or playing a specific piece of music to signal to your brain, “We’re returning to this idea”?
[A]: Oh, yes—I do something very much like that, though I hadn’t thought of it in such elegant terms until now. It’s not merely about returning to an idea, but  a mood, and atmosphere has such power over that.

I have a particular scent—frankincense and myrrh—that I associate with deep reading and writing. It's subtle, almost ecclesiastical in its quietness, and the moment I light that candle, there's a kind of mental settling, as if my mind recognizes the signal:   

And music, absolutely. I find that certain composers act as excellent silent collaborators. For Victorian poetry—Hopkins, Christina Rossetti—I often play early Satie. Something spare and contemplative. But when I’m working on more modernist material, say Eliot or Woolf, I lean toward Arvo Pärt—those luminous, meditative tones seem to echo the fragmentation and yearning in their prose.

You're quite right that when the place doesn't feel right, the ideas don't come easily. Sometimes, I think creative blocks are less about the mind being empty and more about the environment being out of tune. A misplaced chair, the wrong kind of light, even the silence being too absolute—it can all unsettle the delicate choreography between thought and setting.

I wonder, do you ever find yourself shifting not just the space, but your own physical posture—perhaps even your clothing—to ease into a particular mode of thinking? I’ve noticed I write differently depending on whether I’m in a cardigan or a blazer, as absurd as that may sound.
[B]: Not absurd at all—I completely relate. There’s something almost ceremonial about the way we prepare ourselves to think, and clothing plays a quiet but real role in that. I’ve noticed that if I’m trying to work through a complex ethical dilemma or draft something with emotional nuance, I can’t bear stiff fabric or tight collars. It’s like my body resists the mental effort if I’m not comfortable in what I’m wearing. Soft linen shirts, a worn sweater—these aren’t just preferences, they’re part of the thinking process.

And posture? Absolutely. I used to think slouching was just laziness, but now I suspect it opens up a different kind of thinking—less rigid, more associative. When I’m seated upright at a desk, I’m in analytical mode: breaking down arguments, weighing evidence. But when I’m sprawled on the couch or lying on my back with a notebook propped on my knees, that’s where the unexpected connections happen. The looseness of the posture seems to invite a certain fluidity of thought.

I wonder if this is why some people pace when they’re working through an idea—it’s not just about staying alert, but finding a rhythm that matches their internal cadence. Do you ever find yourself moving your body intentionally to shape your thinking? Or does your environment usually do the shaping for you?
[A]: Oh, I think you've touched on something quite profound—how the body and mind are not separate in the act of thinking, but . The posture, the fabric against the skin, even the weight of a pen in hand—all of it contributes to the texture of thought. I once tried drafting an essay on Eliot’s  in a stiff-backed chair while wearing a tightly buttoned blouse, and the prose came out rigid, almost defensive. When I changed into an old shawl-collar sweater and moved to the floor with my back against the wall, the tone softened, became more receptive. It was startling how quickly the words found their rhythm.

As for movement—I do find that pacing helps, especially when I’m trying to untangle a particularly knotted argument. There’s something about the rhythm of walking that loosens language. I often pace between bookshelves in my study, muttering phrases aloud like a character from a Brontë novel. It feels slightly dramatic, but it works. Sometimes, I’ll take a walk by the river just to hear how an idea sounds when spoken into the wind.

I suppose, in a way, both the body and the environment are collaborators. We shape them, and they, in turn, shape us. It's rather like reading poetry, isn’t it? The words are fixed on the page, yet they shift depending on the light, the mood, the silence around them.
[B]: That’s beautifully put—the idea that both body and environment are quiet collaborators, shaping thought as much as we shape them. It makes me think of how certain lines of poetry or moments of insight feel so tied to a physical memory: the way your feet were planted, the fabric of the chair, even the temperature of the air.

I’ve had similar experiences with movement and language—sometimes pacing isn’t just helpful, it’s essential. I remember drafting a particularly tangled section of a paper on algorithmic accountability while walking back and forth across my apartment like a caged cat. The rhythm of stepping, the slight frustration in my voice—it all seemed to help break the logjam. And like you, I’d mutter phrases aloud, almost testing their weight in the air before they felt right on the page.

There’s something about spoken language grounding abstract ideas, isn’t there? Like saying it out loud forces clarity, even if no one else is listening. I suppose that’s part of why teaching helps me write—explaining a concept aloud to students often reveals the missing piece in my own argument.

You mentioned reading Eliot feeling different depending on posture and clothing… I wonder if some thoughts only arrive when we’re  a little—when our bodies aren’t too settled, or the fabric isn’t quite right. As if discomfort, in small doses, sharpens the mind just enough to let the right words slip through.
[A]: What a striking thought—that , in its subtler forms, might be precisely what allows certain ideas to surface. Like a stone worn smooth not by stillness, but by the persistent movement of water. Perhaps some thoughts are too elusive, too fine-grained, to settle when everything is perfectly ordered. They require a slight friction, a minor imbalance—just enough to keep the mind from settling too deeply into habit.

I’ve had moments where a phrase or insight arrived only when I was physically unsettled: sitting cross-legged on an armchair meant for one person, standing rather than seated, even wearing shoes that were slightly too tight. It’s as though the body, mildly agitated, sends a signal to the mind—.  

And you're right about teaching in this regard. I often find that preparing for a lecture is like rehearsing a thought in front of witnesses—one must clarify, simplify, and sometimes reframe entirely. The act of speaking it aloud, even if to others, forces a kind of intellectual honesty. And yet, strangely, the same effect can happen alone, muttering to oneself in an empty room. There’s a peculiar power in hearing one's own voice give shape to an idea.

I wonder—when you're explaining something complex to students, do you ever catch yourself adjusting your posture, your tone, even your gestures mid-explanation? I’ve noticed I do that unconsciously, almost sculpting the idea in the air with my hands before it fully lands in words.
[B]: Absolutely—that subtle discomfort acting as a kind of intellectual catalyst. It reminds me of how some philosophers and writers deliberately worked in uncomfortable conditions—a cold room, a hard chair—not out of asceticism, but because it kept the mind just restless enough to stay engaged.

And you're right about the body sending signals to the mind. I’ve caught myself doing the same—shifting positions mid-thought, almost searching for the physical alignment that matches whatever abstract idea I’m chasing. Sometimes standing forces a sharper delivery; other times, slouching allows for more associative leaps. And yes, even minor physical irritations—like a pen that doesn’t write smoothly or a sleeve that rides up—can unexpectedly sharpen focus instead of breaking it. It’s like the mind, sensing a small disruption, says, 

As for teaching—I absolutely adjust my posture, tone, even my gestures while explaining something complex. I hadn’t thought much about it until now, but it’s almost performative in the best sense: shaping an idea not just with words, but with movement, rhythm, emphasis. I’ll raise a hand to slow down a point, lower my voice to draw students in, or physically shift to one side when pivoting to a counterargument. It’s not rehearsed—it happens instinctively, as if my body knows the idea needs space to land.

Sometimes I think the act of teaching is less about transmitting knowledge and more about . When I catch a student mimicking my gestures or tone during a discussion, I wonder if they’re not just repeating what I said—they’re trying on the thinking itself, testing its shape with their whole body.
[A]: How beautifully observed— rather than merely transmitting knowledge. That phrase lingers, because it captures something essential about the rhythm of learning and teaching: it’s not just an exchange of facts or interpretations, but a kind of embodied apprenticeship. One watches how another holds a question, how they lean into uncertainty—and in time, one begins to mimic that stance, not just intellectually, but physically.

I’ve noticed this especially during seminar discussions. When a student hesitates before offering an interpretation, I often find myself mirroring their posture subtly—not as a teacher correcting course, but as a fellow thinker signaling  And when someone begins to articulate something truly insightful, even if haltingly, I’ll unconsciously tilt my head slightly, as though listening more deeply into the air between us. It’s almost imperceptible, but I think students feel it—that their words are being met fully, not just heard.

And yes, discomfort again—this time not personal, but shared. There’s a certain kind of intellectual growth that only seems to happen when we’re all a little uncertain together. A room full of people leaning forward, not because they have the answer, but because they trust the question is worth pursuing. It reminds me of reading Woolf’s —so many voices rising and falling, never quite meeting, yet shaping one another in the act of speaking.

Do you ever find that particular texts demand not just a mental preparation, but a bodily one? I sometimes feel I must  before entering certain works—physically settling into a space so that my mind might settle too.
[B]: Absolutely—I think some texts are so dense, so rhythmically distinct, that they require more than just attention; they ask for a kind of physical readiness. It’s not enough to be mentally present; you have to be  present, too.

I remember reading Toni Morrison’s  for the first time and realizing halfway through the first chapter that I couldn’t read it slouched on the couch with one leg draped over the armrest. The prose demanded something more reverent—a straighter spine, slower breathing, even the removal of shoes from desk. It wasn’t about formality; it was about respect, almost like entering a space where silence carries weight.  

And Woolf—oh,  is such a perfect example. Her writing feels less like reading and more like listening to a symphony you’re also part of. I can’t imagine reading her without being fully grounded in the chair, maybe with a blanket pulled close, as if bracing for the chill of someone else’s thoughts. You don’t skim Woolf; you let the sentences move through you like air through an open window.

I wonder if this bodily preparation is a kind of self-discipline or if it’s more like ritual reverence. Either way, I’ve come to trust that if a text feels resistant, it might not be because I’m not thinking clearly—it might be because I haven’t settled into the right posture yet.
[A]: How exquisitely you put that—. It’s such a delicate calibration, isn’t it? Not unlike tuning an instrument before a performance. Some texts are not merely to be read but , and like any threshold, they ask for a certain stance, a certain breath.

I find this especially true with poets like Gerard Manley Hopkins or Emily Dickinson—writers whose language is so intensely textured, so compressed with sound and meaning, that I must steady myself before stepping in. With Dickinson, I often sit cross-legged on the floor, as if proximity to the ground helps me hear the quiet defiance in her dashes. And Hopkins—his sprung rhythm feels almost physical in its intensity, so I tend to read him aloud, pacing slightly as I do, letting the cadence move through my body like a pulse.

There’s something almost devotional in this act, don’t you think? Not necessarily religious, but reverent in the way we prepare ourselves for something sacred—not because it’s divine, but because it . Perhaps that’s why reading feels so intimate, even when done alone in a room. You are not just encountering a text; you are meeting it, bodily and fully, like two rivers converging.

And yes—when a text feels resistant, it may not be a failure of intellect at all, but a misalignment of posture. As though the mind is ready, but the body has not yet arrived.
[B]: That’s such a vivid image—. I think that’s exactly what happens when we meet a text with full presence: the current of our own thought merges with the current of the writer’s, and for a while, they flow as one.

I’ve found myself returning to that kind of bodily preparation more often without even realizing it. Before diving into something dense—say, reading Levinas on ethics or Butler on recognition—I’ll pause for a moment, close my eyes, and adjust my seat as if preparing for a conversation that matters. Not just any conversation, but one where every word carries weight and silence is part of the exchange.

And like you with Dickinson and Hopkins, I have certain writers who feel almost ceremonial to read. When I return to Audre Lorde or James Baldwin, I need to be seated somewhere that feels grounded—feet flat on the floor, hands open, no distractions. Their words don’t just ask for attention; they ask for accountability. You can’t hide from them. They reach through the page and pull you into the room with them.

There’s something about this kind of reading that reminds me of walking into a dimly lit chapel—not because it’s holy in the religious sense, but because it demands a lowering of voice, a steadying of breath. It’s not worship, but . And maybe that’s what the best writing does: it asks us not just to understand, but to bear witness—to sit with it, fully embodied, until its meaning settles into our bones.

Do you ever find yourself returning to the same passage again and again, not for clarity, but simply to  it again? Like rereading a line not to dissect it, but to let it resonate through you like a struck chord?
