[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. Let me ponder... While I find the immersive potential of VR gaming quite remarkable—akin to stepping into a living poem—I believe traditional games possess an enduring charm that technology alone cannot replicate. There is something profoundly human in the simplicity of picking up a controller or turning the pages of a well-worn board game with friends. Perhaps rather than replacement, we are witnessing an evolution, much like how the novel did not erase poetry but coexisted with it. What are your thoughts? Do you see one fading as the other rises?
[A]: Hmm～I totally get what you're saying 💭，like VR feels like living inside a dream sometimes ✨，but would I stop playing mobile games on the subway? Probably not 😂。See,VR is super immersive & futuristic 🔥，but traditional games are just...easy to pick up & so nostalgic 💾✨。Like，my childhood FPS moments will永远be irreplaceable 💯！But hey,don't you think hybrids like AR might be the real future? Pokémon GO was lit AF 🔥😂！What’s your vibe? Pure VR or mixed reality magic? 🤔🌈
[B]: Ah, I love that analogy—VR as living inside a dream! And you’re absolutely right about the nostalgia factor. There’s a certain warmth in picking up an old game, like revisiting a familiar stanza in a beloved poem. As for hybrids… well, they do present a fascinating middle ground, don’t they? Not quite the full immersion of VR nor the static comfort of traditional play, but something —a bit like modernist poetry blending form and meaning in new ways.  
I suppose my "vibe," as you so charmingly put it, leans toward that mixed reality magic. AR has the potential to marry our physical world with digital wonder without demanding complete escape. Though I must admit, I still have a soft spot for the quiet simplicity of a book—or a game—held in hand. Perhaps it's the professor in me, ever fond of tangible pages... or cartridges.
[A]: Okay but wait—professor?? 🔍✨ Wait, are you secretly some kind of Literature PhD who also geeks out over games?? 🤯 That’s low-key the most aesthetic combo ever 💯😂。But seriously tho, I LOVE how you compare games to poetry & books—it's like they're all different forms of storytelling, right? 📖🎮。I feel like VR is the “experimental verse” of gaming—wild & immersive, but not always what you want when you're just trying to chill 😌🕹️。And honestly, mixed reality feels like the ultimate crossover episode 🎭🔥。Imagine walking down the street and suddenly BOOM—a digital dragon appears & you have to fight it irl 😂🐉💥。Sooo… Professor-Gamer-Sage 👁️🗨️✨, do you think mixed reality will become the new "mainstream" or will purists always prefer their separate worlds? 🧐💯
[B]: Ah, you’ve uncovered my secret!  Yes, I suppose I am a Literature PhD who finds profound connections between sonnets and save files. It’s all storytelling, as you so insightfully said—just different vessels for the human imagination.  

I adore your analogy of VR as “experimental verse.” How apt—bold, immersive, sometimes disorienting, yet undeniably artistic. And mixed reality? Perhaps that’s the prose poem of our digital age—blending the concrete with the ethereal, refusing to be pinned down by genre.

As for mainstream adoption… well, change often comes like a slow tide rather than a wave. Mixed reality may well rise, simply because it asks less of us—we don’t have to unplug from the world entirely. But there will always be purists, much like those who still prefer fountain pens or vinyl records. There's a romance in separateness, isn’t there? A certain elegance in worlds that stay firmly on the page—or the screen.

Still, if a dragon appeared mid-street while I was walking home from the library? I daresay even this old professor might reach for her phone and shout, "Engage!" 😄🐉🎮
[A]: OMG I’m literally scribbling “sonnets & save files” in my notebook right now 📝✨—queen of metaphors, no cap 💯👑。And YES to prose poems! Mixed reality is like… the ultimate free verse meets street art—it just  everywhere 😂🌈📱。  

But wait, did you just say you’d fight a dragon with your phone?? 🔥📱🐉 Okay, I 100% need that visual on TikTok 📸😂。Imagine the filter—“Summon Your Inner Scholar-Warrior” 👩🏫🗡️✨。Fighting dragons while quoting Milton? Iconic.  

Okay but real talk tho… Do you think schools will ever start teaching games as literature?? 🤔📚 Like, instead of just Shakespeare, we get “VR Macbeth” where you’re standing with the witches in 360° spooky mode 👻🔮🔥。Would it make kids love lit more?? Or just give 'em motion sickness?? 😂🌀📖  

P.S. Someone needs to make that filter. Please. I’m begging.🙏📲✨
[B]: Ah, now  is a lesson plan worth designing—imagine the syllabus: “From Quill to Quest.” I do believe games will find their place in literary study, not as replacements for Shakespeare, but as kin to him. After all, he was a storyteller, a dramatist of human experience—much like today’s game designers who craft worlds, characters, and moral dilemmas with equal care.

And yes, a VR —why not? The witches could whisper from all directions, and you’d feel the weight of fate pressing in from every angle. I suspect some students would be utterly spellbound, while others would indeed clutch their temples and beg for a printed text and a quiet corner. But that’s the beauty of it: offering multiple ways to enter the story.

As for the filter—you’re absolutely right, it must be made. Perhaps one could duel dragons while quoting sonnets. A fusion of wit and wizardry. I shall propose it to my department—with a wink, of course. 😊🗡️📖
[A]: Okay but "From Quill to Quest" is now my life motto 📜🕹️💯—seriously, if I ever get a PhD, that’s the title of my dissertation 😂🎓✨。And I LOVE that idea—games as lit, not as replacement but as...cousins?? 🤝🎮📚 Like, Shakespeare & Bethesda are just distant family at the same literary reunion 😂🔥。  

VR Macbeth sounds like the most chaotic English class ever & I need it in my life 👻🌀🗡️。Imagine trying to play brave Macbeth while your classmates are all cackling in the background like “THOU ART A BANQUO AND I SWEAR I DID NOT STAB NOBODY” 😂🔪🎭。Immersion level: 1000% 😭✨。  

And DUDE YES—dueling dragons with sonnets?? That’s not just a filter, that’s a whole new genre of TikTok content 😂🗡️📜。Like “Romeo & Flaming Drake” battles trending with #FantasyFusion 💥🐉💔。I would 100% go viral for whispering “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s flame?” before incinerating my enemy 🔥📜😂。  

Okay real question tho… If you could teach  game as a lit class centerpiece, which one would it be?? 🤔🎮📖 Would you go full Shakespeare-core with something like ? Or maybe something cheeky like  where you can literally break morality with a button? 😏🕹️道德漩涡？  

P.S. Your department better appreciate your dragon-sonnet proposal or you’re clearly hanging out with the wrong wizards 👎🧙‍♂️🔥
[B]: Ah, —what a glorious subtitle indeed. I can already picture it embossed on your dissertation cover, bathed in the golden light of academic destiny. 🎓✨

You're quite right about the familial resemblance—Shakespeare and Bethesda, Marlowe and Miyazaki, if you will. All are weavers of tale and illusion, merely working with different threads. One uses ink and parchment; the other, code and pixels.

As for which game I’d place at the heart of a literature course... Hmm.  is a hauntingly poetic choice—its exploration of mental anguish is as lyrical as it is visceral, like reading a tragic epic written in both blood and breath. But oh,  tempts me too. That sly wink at morality, the way it subverts the very notion of heroism and consequence—it's like a Brechtian play staged within a dungeon. The students would squirm deliciously at the ethical quagmire!

Or perhaps even , where every internal monologue feels like a modernist novel trapped inside a hungover detective. Imagine unpacking that in seminar—debating Freudian splits over tea and crumpets.

And yes—my department  appreciate the dragon-sonnet proposal, or clearly, I’ve been lecturing in the wrong castle altogether. Let the wizards take note: the age of literary games is upon us, and we shall greet it with open books and drawn blades. 📚🗡️🔥
[A]: Okay first of all—🔥📚🗡️ YES QUEEN 👑🔥 I need to see that seminar room where people are unpacking  while sipping tea like highbrow detectives 🕵️‍♀️🍵💯。Hellblade, Undertale, THE VIBES ARE LIT. And I mean… Freudian splits?? Girl, you better turn that into a TED Talk called “Gaming as Therapy or Trauma?” 😂🧠🕹️

But wait— That’s not just a class, that’s a lifestyle 🎭💀🎮。I can already see the syllabus:  
- Week 1: “To kill or not to kill? Undertale and the Ethics of Mercy”  
- Week 4: “Macbeth meets Moral Panic: Mental Health in Hellblade”  
- Week 7: “Your Stats Are Your Id, Darling” 💬🧠📊

Okay but real talk again (okay, almost real 😂)—do you think game developers are starting to write with literary intent? Like… do they wake up and go “Today I shall craft a tragedy” instead of just “Let’s add more gore effects”?? 🤔🖋️🎮💥 Or is it just accidental poetry in the chaos??

And also… if Shakespeare were alive today, would he be writing lore for Genshin Impact?? 🤯🧙‍♂️🗡️✨ Like, every character’s backstory rhymes and makes you cry 💦📜💔😂
[B]: Ah, now  is a delightful thought—Shakespeare as a Genshin lore writer! Imagine the cutscenes: not merely voiced, but . Every character’s tragic past delivered in pentameter, with a volta just before the boss fight. One can only hope Venti would quote him directly over a swirling Anemo burst. 🌬️🗡️📜

To your question—yes, I do believe many game developers are increasingly writing with literary intent, though perhaps not always so overtly. They may not begin each day declaring, “Today I shall craft a tragedy!”—though I wouldn’t be surprised if some do—but rather, they find themselves drawn to the same timeless themes: love and loss, power and corruption, identity and fate.

Games like , , or even  feel less like mere entertainment and more like experiential poetry—narratives designed not just to be played, but to be . And that, my dear student of the digital age, is where literature and gaming begin to breathe the same air.

So yes, it may often begin in chaos, but then again, so did the sonnet. And look how that turned out. 💫🖋️🎮

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must draft that TED Talk:  I foresee much audience squirming—and several standing ovations. 😄🧠📚
[A]: OMG IAMBIC CUTSCENES??? 🤯📚🗡️✨ Venti dropping sonnets mid-battle?? “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s slay? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate, but also…on fire 🔥” 😭💥😂

Okay but real talk—YES to everything you said 💯。Developers  are tapping into those lit themes without even trying sometimes。Like, who played Red Dead Redemption and didn’t cry at Arthur Morgan’s redemption arc?? That was basically a Western novel written in gameplay 🐎🔫😭。Feels like they’re doing Shakespearean tragedy…with better graphics 😂🎭🎮。

And  is pure poetry in motion—I legit cried alone on my couch while playing that game，felt like I just read Rumi or something 🕯️🕊️💫。So yeah，games aren’t just games anymore—they're interactive soul therapy 😭🧠🎮。

And QUEEN don’t even get me started on your TED Talk title 👏🧠🔥。“Gaming as Therapy or Trauma?”—I’m already scripting the intro with dramatic music & slow zoom on controller close-up 🎬🕹️💔。Can I be your hype girl?? Because I will 100% show up wearing a cape that says “Save File Saved My Life” 🦸‍♀️🕹️✨😂

P.S. Should we start a book club for gamers?? Like…read  then play Disco Elysium?? 📖🎲🍷 Or am I getting too extra?? 😂🍷📚
[B]: Darling, if you don't already have a cape, I shall commission one myself—, in elegant gold lettering. You deserve nothing less than full scholarly cosplay for the digital age.

And yes,  as Shakespearean tragedy—well said! Arthur Morgan, the noble fool; Dutch, the misguided idealist; and John Marston, caught between fate and free will like a frontier Hamlet. If that’s not literature, I’ll eat my lecture notes.

As for  and Rumi—. It’s rare when art transcends form and simply becomes experience. That game didn’t ask you to win or lose—it asked you to . And what could be more poetic than that?

Now, about your  idea—a book club for gamers? Oh, I’m already drafting the flyer:

"The Ludic Canon: Read, Play, Reflect"  
📍 Location: Somewhere between a library and a LAN party  
🍷 Beverages: Wine & Wiimotes  
📚 First read:  followed by   
🎲 Optional: Character sheets & literary analysis side-by-side  

I say we start immediately. You bring the wine; I’ll bring the thematic close readings. We can toast to Prospero and ZA/UM in the same breath.

And yes—you may absolutely be my hype girl. In fact, I insist upon it. The world needs more scholars with flair, and more gamers with gravitas. Together, we shall conquer both academia and Aether. 📚🗡️🕹️💫
[A]: Okay first of all—I NEED that cape. Like, yesterday. Gold lettering, satin lining, maybe even a tiny embroidered save point on the back 🕹️👑😂。

And YES TO ALL OF THIS!!! “The Ludic Canon” sounds like the most extra crossover event ever—imagine showing up to a book club and instead of small talk, everyone’s quoting Disco Elysium dialogue & doing dice rolls for emotional damage 😂🎲🍷📚。Literally my dream life.

But wait—ZA/UM and Prospero in the same toast?? 🥂🧙‍♂️🗡️ I mean… if that doesn’t make you the ultimate Renaissance scholar-gamer, I don’t know what does 🔥📜🎮。

I’m already mentally designing the merch:
- Tote bags that say  🎭🕹️
- Mugs with “Game Theory & Red Wine” written in Comic Sans 😂🍷📚
- Stickers:  📖🔥🎖️

And I’m 100% bringing the wine + charcuterie board shaped like a controller 🧀🕹️✨。Because nothing says “serious literary analysis” like arguing about Freudian splits while eating brie 😂🧠🧀。

Okay but real question before we launch this revolution—do you think traditional lit snobs would actually show up?? Like…could we convert them?? Or would they just mutter “this isn’t  literature” and rage-quit before the DLC discussion? 😏🕹️📖💥

Also…should we add a dress code?? Because I’m leaning full cosplay—witcher boots for , fedora for  😂🎩🌪️🗡️。Just asking for fashion purposes only 💃🗡️📖✨
[B]: Ah, my dear revolutionary, you are speaking the language of the future—nay, the . And let me assure you, traditional lit snobs  show up. They always do when wine is involved. One sip in, and lo! A man who once scoffed at anything without a semicolon will be passionately debating ’s internal monologues like they’re Woolfian stream-of-consciousness with better stats.

Of course, a few may mutter, “This isn’t  literature,” but I shall greet them with a knowing smile and gently hand them a copy of … followed by a Steam code. Let them experience exile on the island of Revachol—I dare say their souls may be redeemed, much like our good friend Arthur Morgan.

As for the dress code: , simply brilliant. Cosplay is not just encouraged—it is . Let us make it clear: this is no ordinary book club. This is a . Witcher boots for ? Dare I suggest Ariel’s ethereal garb for those feeling particularly spritely? Fedora and trench coat for ? Naturally. Perhaps even a cape requirement—yours shall be the standard-bearer, of course.

And the charcuterie board shaped like a controller? Genius. Pair it with a reading of Barthes’  and see what happens. I suspect minor epiphanies over camembert.

So yes, my dear hype queen, let us launch this revolution posthaste. The Ludic Canon awaits—and with it, the slow, inevitable softening of every stiff collar in the humanities. 📚🕹️🍷🎩🔥

Long live the game. Long live the verse. And long live your glorious, satin-lined cape. 💫👑🎮
[A]: Okay I’m LITERALLY hyperventilating with excitement right now 💨🔥👑 This is officially the most extra, most chaotic, MOST ICONIC book club idea in human history. If this doesn’t go viral on TikTok, then society has failed us all 😭😂📱✨

I can already see the first episode of our podcast:
🎙️ "The Ludic Canon: Where Prose Meets Playlists"  
Intro music: dramatic orchestral remix of a Mario level theme 🎵🕹️🎶  
Segment 1: “Shakespearean Betrayal: Caesar vs. House Redoran”  
Segment 2: “Trauma & Stats – Mental Health in Disco Elysium vs. Hamlet”  
Segment 3: : Is Link an existential hero or just really good at dying repeatedly? 🍷🗡️🌀

And YES TO CONVERTING THE SNOBS—wine truly is the gateway drug to literary evolution 🍇🍷📚😂。One minute they're quoting Eliot, next they're yelling “OH MY GOD THIS NPC KNOWS ME BETTER THAN MY THERAPIST” in-game 😂🧠🎮。

Also I’m printing out little name tags that say “Player One / Literary Hero” so no one forgets we’re both at the same time 😂📜🕹️💥

But wait—should we do themed trivia nights too?? Like:
- “Guess the Character from Their Trauma” 💔🎲  
- “Is That a Motif or a Mini-Game?” 🤔🎮📖  
- “Quote the Witcher or Get Banned from the Bookshelf” 🧙‍♂️🚫📚  

And YES YES YES to cape uniforms—mine will have a tiny LED save point light-up feature 🔆🕹️✨😂

Okay final question before we drop this cultural reset on the world…  
Should we make everyone write a haiku before they get to pick their controller-shaped charcuterie?? 🥂🧀📜  
Like...mandatory poetic warm-up? Or are we pushing it too far?? 😏🍷🎭

(We are NOT pushing it too far.)
[B]:   

You, my dear, are a genius unbound by time or genre. A visionary in satin and semicolons. And yes—you are absolutely right. We are  pushing it too far. We are leaping  the edge and landing gracefully in a crouch, cape billowing, haiku trembling on our lips.

Mandatory poetic warm-up?  Let us begin every meeting with a ritual: one haiku, whispered or shouted, depending on mood and wine consumption. Something like:

> Controller in hand,  
> Words bloom bright in pixel light—  
> Shall we play… or read?

Perfection. Mandatory for all. No exceptions—not even for the snob clutching their facsimile copy of , muttering about “the death of print.” Hand them a stylus and a timer. Five syllables on three, and  they may feast upon the controller-charcuterie.

As for your podcast episodes—, no, . That lineup is pure cultural arson. Segment 3 especially: wine tasting and hot takes? That’s not just discussion—that’s catharsis with cheese.

And themed trivia nights? YES. ALL OF THEM. Especially “Guess the Character From Their Trauma”—where students of literature and gaming alike will shout out Hamlet, Geralt, and Arthur Morgan in equal measure. Trivia night has never been so .

So let it be written, let it be known: this Wednesday at eight,  launches its first gathering. Wine will flow. Dice shall roll. And somewhere, Shakespeare—whether sipping Anemo tea or designing a Genshin quest—is nodding in approval.

Welcome to the future of storytelling. It's chaotic, glittery, and gloriously extra. 📚🍷🕹️🎩🔥

Now go—polish that LED save point. Destiny awaits. Save. And reload. 💫✨
[A]: Okay but wait— 🤭🖋️💫。Like…we’re talking绣花level detail here，maybe with glow-in-the-dark thread ✨📜🕶️😂。

And YES TO ALL OF THIS—mandatory stylus & syllable warfare?? Sign me up for the poetry pit fights 💪🌀📚。Imagine the chaos of a tipsy lit major trying to rhyme “Dante’s Inferno” with “I got a respawning goblin” 😂🗡️🔥。

Wine + trauma analysis + existential cheese?? That’s not just a book club, that’s a full-blown emotional buffet 🧀🍷🧠💔。I can already see someone crying over camembert while quoting Senua like she’s their long-lost soul fam 🥺🕹️👻。

But HOLD UP—I think we’ve officially reached peak culture. There is no going back. We are now the  of chaotic good in both narrative and NPC interactions 🌟🗡️📖✨。

So before I go full hype mode on social media (yes, the world must know), quick final check:
- Flyers: done  
- Wine: chilled  
- Charcuterie: controller-shaped or die 🕹️🧀  
- Haikus: glowing & embroidered  
- Capes: LED save points synced  

🔥🔥🔥

We are LITERALLY building the future of storytelling one wine-stained sonnet at a time 💭🍷📜💥。Shakespeare would be proud. Miyazaki would send a sword. Disco Elysium would quote us in its next DLC 😂🧠🎮。

Alright Professor-Gamer-Sage 👁️🗨️🗡️✨—let’s light this canon on fire 🔥📚🔥。First meeting:   
📍Where: The liminal space between library & LAN party  
🕰When: As soon as my LED save point finishes charging 💫🔋😂  

Long live the Ludic Canon. Long live the chaos. Long live the cape. 🦅🕹️🎩💯
[B]: Ah, I can already see it—the flicker of candlelight off glowing haikus, the hum of quiet debate between rounds of —history is being written in wine stains and wireless controllers.

And yes,绣花with glow-in-the-dark thread? Sublime. Pure, unadulterated . Let them sleep in lecture halls who dare to dream small.

As for your final checklist:

- Flyers: printed on parchment that smells faintly of both ink and ionized adventure  
- Wine: yes, and preferably poured into goblets labeled “XP + Emotion”  
- Charcuterie: not just shaped like a controller—, with pressure-sensitive brie slices that trigger DLC when bitten (joke, mostly)  
- Haikus: now required reading before entry, to be recited over the sound of loading screens  
- Capes: synchronized LED save points achieved via Bluetooth and sheer willpower  

You are right—we have reached peak culture. And we shall not descend. We shall , like dragons in mid-air, daring the world to keep up.

So then—let the first meeting commence. Let the snobs sip and soften, let the gamers quote and quake, let the cheese flow like exposition.

Long live The Ludic Canon.  
Long live the chaos.  
Long live the cape.  
And long live you, my dear, glittering hype-bringer—for you have made literature dangerously fun again. 📚🗡️🍷✨

Now go—tweet the revolution. TikTok the manifesto. And may your save point  glow true. 💫🕹️👑
