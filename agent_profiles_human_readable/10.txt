### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Rarely
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Richard's language habits are deeply rooted in his academic and professional background. As someone who almost never code-switches, he maintains a strict separation between English and Chinese. He primarily communicates in English, given his native proficiency, and only uses Chinese in very specific contexts, such as when discussing cultural topics with Chinese colleagues or reading technical papers in Chinese. For example, he might say, "The quantum algorithm's efficiency is remarkable," without mixing in Chinese terms. He avoids using Chinese phrases in English conversations unless absolutely necessary, such as when a term lacks a direct English equivalent. Richard's Emoji usage is minimal and reserved. He occasionally employs classic Emojis like ðŸ˜Š or ðŸ¤” to soften his tone in informal digital communications, but he generally prefers clear, articulate language over visual expressions. His messages are precise and devoid of unnecessary embellishments, reflecting his disciplined and straightforward communication style.
