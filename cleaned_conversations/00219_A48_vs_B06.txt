[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, the concept of "chill" has evolved rather dramatically in recent years. When I was a medical student, we simply called it "resting." But today, it seems to encompass an entire lifestyle. Personally, my weekends tend to oscillate between two poles: either tending to my rose bushes and herb garden - I find pruning and deadheading rather therapeutic - or engaging in what I call "intellectual excursions." 

Last Saturday, for instance, I attended a lecture on the neurobiological underpinnings of decision-making at the university's law school. Quite fascinating how our prefrontal cortex interacts with legal reasoning. Then again, there are those weekends when I just stay home, put on a Mozart piano concerto, and peruse old medical journals. The key, I suppose, is balance. What about you? Do you prefer more active forms of relaxation or passive ones?
[A]: Ah, I love how you described it as "intellectual excursions"~ 🤓 That actually sounds super refreshing in a nerdy-cool way. I’m totally with you on balance being key — though my version of “nerdy” might lean more toward binge-watching crime documentaries while dissecting the plot like a real case 🕵️‍♂️（okay, guilty pleasure time 😅）.

But hey, your weekend lecture scene reminded me — I recently stumbled upon this bizarre 19th-century forensic case during a jog (yes, multitasking while sweating!). It involved some sketchy arsenic poisoning & amateur sleuthing by a pharmacist. Total podcast gold if you ask me. Ever had a moment where something random just stuck with you like that?
[B]: Ah, now that does sound like a most intriguing case - arsenic poisoning always carries such deliciously diabolical implications. I must confess, my mind immediately jumps to the classic cases from the 19th century, where pharmacists often played both villain and detective. One particular instance comes to mind involving a Parisian apothecary who managed to poison three relatives before being unmasked by his own apprentice. The trial was a spectacle! 

You know, it fascinates me how certain details linger in our minds while others fade. That said, your podcast idea has real merit. Perhaps you could call it... ? No, perhaps something more dramatic. ? Hmm. 

In any case, I find it remarkable how everyday moments - jogging, gardening, even pruning rose bushes - can unearth these historical curiosities. It's as though the past is always whispering beneath our feet, waiting for the right moment to resurface. Tell me, have you ever considered writing about that arsenic case? Or perhaps you're secretly plotting your own forensic podcast series?
[A]: Oh, I love the way you phrased that —  😍 It’s honestly giving me full-blown goosebumps (and maybe a new podcast intro idea... 🎧✨). 

As for writing or hosting something myself? Well... let's just say I’ve been scribbling some episode outlines in my notes app under titles like ... 🤭 Admittedly, it's still stuck somewhere between “passion project” and “what if I sound too nerdy?” But hey, if people can make podcasts about cereal mascots solving murders, why not arsenic scandals with a side of herbal tea history?

And speaking of — your Parisian apothecary story just gave me chills AND a plot twist idea for my next fictional cold case. Seriously, though... do you ever get that eerie feeling when digging into old crimes, like you're almost channeling someone's last moments? Or is that just my overactive imagination running wild again?
[B]: Ah, that feeling – yes, I know it all too well. Some might call it professional hazard, but I prefer to think of it as... occupational resonance. There’s a moment, you see, when reviewing old case files – particularly the ones steeped in poison and betrayal – when the ink on the page seems to lift, and you're no longer reading about the past, but standing in its shadow.

I recall once, during a rather late evening reviewing a 1920s poisoning case from rural Sussex, I could almost smell the damp apothecary shelves and hear the faint clink of glass vials – though, of course, it was likely just the central heating kicking in. Still, the sensation was vivid. It's as if the emotional residue of those involved lingers, preserved in the档案 like perfume in an old book.

And let me assure you, there's nothing "just" about your imagination – quite the contrary. That sensitivity is precisely what makes for compelling storytelling. As for your podcast title, ? Delightfully whimsical. I can already picture the cover art – a teacup with a suspicious-looking residue at the bottom.

You know, if you ever do decide to take the plunge, I’d be more than happy to offer a few historical tidbits.Consider it a bit of forensic mentorship from one enthusiast to another.
[A]: Oh my gosh,  😍——that’s honestly the most poetic way I’ve ever heard someone describe feeling haunted by case files 📜👻. And you had me at "emotional residue preserved like perfume in an old book." Are you sure you’re not secretly a novelist moonlighting as a medical examiner? 

That story about the 1920s apothecary shelves gave me literal chills… in the best way possible. Honestly, if that's just your average Tuesday night, I need to up my game. Maybe I should start lighting candles while reviewing my notes — nothing suspiciously scented, of course 😉.

And forensic mentorship?! Say no more — I am  holding you to that. How about we strike a deal: you feed me historical poison scandals, and I’ll turn them into binge-worthy audio drama material? We could even add a segment called “Ethan’s Expert Footnotes” or something equally dramatic. Podcast royalty for you, my friend 🎤💰✨.

So... when can I rope you into recording a pilot episode? I promise not to make it too morbid. Probably 😏.
[B]: Ah, now that’s the kind of enthusiasm I live for — infectious, imaginative, and just the right shade of macabre. I must admit,  has a rather distinguished ring to it. One could almost imagine it being read in a deep, BBC-style voiceover with a faint echo of gravitas.

As for your candle idea — brilliant, but I’d suggest something subtle, perhaps neroli or vetiver. You want ambiance, not olfactory distraction. After all, one must remain sharp when dealing with arsenic dosages and alibi timelines.

Now, about that pilot episode… I do have a particularly juicy case from 1874 involving a Belgian confectioner, a vial of digitalis, and a suspiciously generous serving of marzipan. The trial transcript is positively dripping with irony — the man was literally sweetening his crimes. I think your audience would be .

As for recording — well, I suppose if you promise to handle the editing, I can manage the content. Just give me enough time to dust off my notes and find the right pair of spectacles. The ones with the gold rims — they lend an air of authority. Shall we say… next Saturday evening? I’ll brew the tea, you bring the recorder.

And Ethan? If this takes off, I expect theme music. Something baroque, with a harpsichord undertone. Think .
[A]: Oh wow. Next Saturday evening just became my new holiday 🎉✨. I am  obsessed with the idea of you in gold-rimmed spectacles, tea in hand, dropping forensic knowledge like it’s Shakespearean drama — which, let’s be real, it kind of is.

Baroque theme music? Harpsichord undertone?! You are speaking my language now 😍🫶 I can already picture the promo art: candlelit close-up of you looking suspiciously wise over a magnifying glass, while I lurk in the background holding a teacup like a true crime prop master 🕯️🕵️‍♂️🍵.

And ? That line alone deserves its own dramatic zoom & sound effect. Digitalis in marzipan? Chef’s kiss 👨‍🍳💯. Honestly, that’s the kind of twisted elegance modern poisoners just don’t appreciate enough anymore.

Leave the ambiance and editing to me — I’ve been known to turn a quiet garage into a makeshift studio with nothing but headphones, duct tape, and caffeine 💻🎧☕. Just bring the stories, the glasses, and maybe a pinch of that eerie apothecary atmosphere you mentioned earlier.

I’ll send over a rough outline this week — sound good? Oh man, we are really doing this...
[B]: Oh, we are absolutely doing this — and if I may say, your enthusiasm is both invigorating and slightly terrifying in the best possible way. There’s nothing quite like the fervor of a true crime devotee armed with caffeine and duct tape.

I must admit, the image you painted — me in gold spectacles, peering over a magnifying glass like some forensic Gandalf — is rather spot on. Though I might suggest a slight wardrobe adjustment: cravat perhaps? Just enough to complete the baroque aesthetic without veering into full Victorian cosplay.

Now, about that dramatic zoom effect — I propose we take it one step further. Every time we mention digitalis or arsenic, we cut to a slow-motion shot of you dramatically pouring tea into a porcelain cup, accompanied by a faint  of air, as though the toxins themselves are swirling with intent.

And yes, send the outline whenever you’re ready. I shall prepare accordingly: my favorite chair, a pot of Earl Grey, and my 1874 trial transcript — still slightly foxed from age, but legible enough for podcast purposes.

I must say, Ethan, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon something rather unique here. A fusion of history, horror, and herb gardens. Who knew?

So... pencil me in for next Saturday. And bring extra microphones — I have a feeling we’ll want to capture every ominous pause.
[A]: Oh wow — ?! 😂 I mean, you’re absolutely right — the look needs to be iconic. I can already picture it on the show poster: dramatic lighting, your mysterious side-eye, and me awkwardly trying not to spill tea everywhere like a true professional 🫖🤦‍♂️.

And slow-motion toxin tea-pouring? Genius. Absolutely unhinged, but GENIUS. I’m imagining eerie music swelling as the amber liquid hits the cup — like  meets  creepier cousin. Maybe we throw in a faint ticking clock sound in the background for tension? Or the soft clink of suspicious glass vials...?

Outline incoming this week, promise — though now I feel the pressure to live up to the baroque-crime-drama standard you’ve set 🎼🔪. But hey, if 19th-century confectioners can poison people with marzipan and style, I can at least try to edit something worthy of your spectacles.

P.S. Extra microphones? Noted. I’ll even bring one just in case things get too ominous and someone (probably me) knocks over a candle mid-recording. Safety first, ambiance second 🕯️⚠️.

So… see you Saturday. History, horror, herb gardens — and hopefully no real toxins involved 🙏🍷🚫💀.
[B]: Ah, the look  be iconic — after all, we are not simply telling stories; we are summoning shadows. And you, my friend, are the curator of those shadows. A most capable one, I might add, even if your tea-pouring technique requires a touch more gravitas and a tad less... enthusiasm.

As for the ominous ambiance — ticking clocks, clinking vials, perhaps the faintest echo of footsteps in a stone corridor — yes, yes, and yes. I do believe sound design is half the battle when it comes to ensnaring the imagination. Though I must warn you: should the vial sounds prove too authentic, I may find myself glancing over my shoulder for the rest of the evening.

Pressure? My dear Ethan, there is no pressure — only the gentle weight of legacy. We are, after all, carrying forth the grand tradition of those who peered into darkness with a magnifying glass and a notebook. Admittedly, with far better lighting and significantly fewer quills.

And let us not forget — herb gardens are our tether to normalcy. Basil for calm, lavender for clarity, and rosemary, of course, for remembrance. Particularly useful when recounting tales of long-forgotten crimes.

Saturday cannot come soon enough. I shall see you then — spectacles polished, cravat adjusted, and vials (strictly for ambiance) tastefully arranged just out of frame.

To history, horror, and the occasional misplaced candle.
[A]: To history, horror, and the occasional misplaced candle indeed 🕯️🕯️— I mean, ? You are speaking pure art direction gold right now. Honestly, if this podcast flops, we could absolutely market ourselves as immersive gothic theater meets true crime noir. Candlelit pop-up tours across old libraries & abandoned apothecaries 🏛️🕵️‍♂️🫖.

You’re absolutely right about sound design too — it’s wild how a well-placed  or  can make even a modern studio feel like a 19th-century morgue. I might even dig up some royalty-free thunderstorm samples... just to really unsettle our listeners 😈🎧.

And legacy! I love that framing. We’re not just telling stories — we're stitching together whispers from the past with forensic thread. Basil for calm? Please. At this point, I’m drinking rosemary tea  just to remember what episode outline I’m on.

See you Saturday with my most dramatic lighting setup yet. I’ll bring extra lavender essential oil in case things get too intense (or dusty). And hey — no pressure, but don’t forget to practice your ominous pause. You know… the one that makes people check behind their couches.
[B]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true curator of the macabre — immersive gothic theater meets true crime noir? My dear Ethan, that’s not contingency planning, that’s vision. I can already picture it: velvet drapes, flickering candlelight, and the faint scent of bergamot mingling with something just slightly... unplaceable.

And thunderstorms? Oh, . There's nothing quite like a distant rumble to make a listener draw their blanket a little tighter and glance toward the hallway. Perhaps we should even consider ambient whispers in Latin — just faintly intelligible, just unsettling enough. Nothing too Wicker Man, mind you, but... suggestive.

You know, I’ve always believed that every good story has a texture — some are smooth, others rough with tension. Ours will be embroidered, rich with thread pulled from both law books and lunatic asylums. And yes, we are stitching whispers into fabric, using forensic thread to mend the tears left behind by time.

As for rosemary — excellent choice. I’ve taken to placing a sprig near my desk lamp. It does wonders for recall, though I suspect half the effect is psychological. Still, if it keeps us on track, so be it.

Now, concerning Saturday: ominous pause? Practiced. Perfected. Some might say weaponized. And I shall bring the cravat — nay,  the cravat — for atmosphere, for gravitas, and perhaps just a touch of absurdity.

Lavender oil? Lighting? You think of everything. Very well then — let us meet at the appointed hour, amidst the microphones and memory, the tea and typewritten notes.

Saturday awaits, and it shall not know what hit it.
[A]: Oh, I  the direction we’re heading — embroidered tension with thread from law books and lunatic asylums? That’s not just storytelling, that’s psychological haute couture 👔🔪🧵. And Latin whispers? Subtly unsettling? I’m already drafting a mental note to find someone who can mutter  just loud enough to haunt the intro.

You’re right about texture too — smooth crime stories are for daytime TV; we’re weaving something you can , like touching old parchment in a locked attic. Every creak, every pause, every faint  of wax should feel intentional. This isn’t just a podcast anymore — it’s a sensory séance.

And your ominous pause? Weaponized?! Ethan, I am . In the best way possible 😍🫶 Please, don’t hold back on Saturday — let those silences linger just long enough for people to rethink their life choices or check if their doors are locked. Pure auditory gaslighting at this point.

Also, cravat ??? You are fully leaning into this aesthetic now, and honestly? Iconic. I may have to up my wardrobe game from “casual hoodie” to “mysterious scarf draped dramatically over shoulder.” We need contrast — the yin of your baroque gravitas to my brooding bohemian chaos 🧣🕯️🎧.

Saturday is going to be legendary. I’ll see you there — microphones armed, ambiance dialed to eleven, and tea steeped in suspense.

Let the séance begin.
[B]: Ah,  — now  is a phrase worth engraving on a silver snuff box and passing around at the next grim and glittering symposium. You have an eye for texture, my friend, and I do believe we are crafting something not merely to be heard, but to be  — like tracing the grain of a confession letter written in trembling ink.

, whispered through static? Yes, yes, and thrice yes. We shall commission that very sound — low, breathy, as though spoken by someone who has long since stopped breathing but hasn’t quite realized it yet. And the wax drip? Oh, we’ll layer that in just beneath the surface tension of silence. Subtlety is everything. A good séance should never announce itself; it should seep in, unnoticed until the room feels far too still.

As for the ominous pause — let me assure you, it is no mere silence. It is . The kind of silence that makes listeners lean forward, teacup forgotten, as if proximity might grant them insight or escape — whichever comes first. I shall deploy it with precision. Timing is everything in both poison and storytelling, after all.

And wardrobe? My dear Ethan, you needn't fret. Your brooding bohemian chaos will serve us well against my baroque gravitas. Think  meets  in a dimly lit drawing room where the wallpaper is peeling just enough to reveal something... unsettling beneath.

Microphones armed, ambiance dialed to eleven — I shall arrive fully prepared to haunt, to mesmerize, and perhaps even to unsettle myself. After all, once we begin, even I cannot predict precisely where the séance may lead.

Let history, horror, and a whisper of the uncanny take the floor.  
Saturday awaits — and this time, it will  leave unchanged.
[A]: Oh,  engraved on a silver snuff box? I mean, if that’s not the epitome of cursed elegance, I don’t know what is 😍🕯️. And let’s be real — we’re already halfway to forming our own secret society of literary necromancers. Next thing you know, we’ll be communicating via wax-sealed audio files and requiring listeners to burn sage before each episode.

Your description of the  just gave me literal goosebumps again 🦆🫶—I mean, how are you so good at this? That pause isn’t just storytelling technique anymore; it’s psychological foreplay. Listeners won’t know whether to lean in or bolt for the door. Honestly, I’m half-convinced you’ve been training your pauses in a soundproof chamber of solitude like some vocal martial artist.

And the  whisper through static? I’m already drafting emails to obscure sound artists with titles like “Urgent: Need Latin spoken by a ghost. Budget flexible.” We are absolutely building a world where people hit pause just to make sure their headphones aren’t malfunctioning.

As for wardrobe synergy — Dorian meets Sherlock? You flatter me. I was aiming more for "disheveled poet who accidentally wandered onto a crime scene," but hey, if it contrasts well with your  vibe, I’ll take it.

Saturday can’t come soon enough. I’ll bring extra candles, eerie ambiance, and my most unsettlingly calm voice. Let’s make history bleed into the present, one ominously paused syllable at a time.

The séance begins... and I have a feeling it’s not leaving quietly.
[B]: Ah,  — now there’s a phrase that could make even Freud reach for his notebook. And yes, we are absolutely constructing a world where listeners lean in, breath held, convinced their headphones are haunted — only to realize the silence has been inside them all along.

You flatter me with your "vocal martial artist" theory, but let’s be honest — these pauses were honed in courtrooms where time stretches like taffy and every second drips with implication. I’ve sat across from men and women who lied through stillness, and others who confessed simply because the silence became too heavy to bear. Weaponized indeed.

As for our secret society of literary necromancers — I say we embrace it fully. Wax-sealed audio files? Absolutely. Sage burning before each episode? Why not? Perhaps we should draft a listener's oath — something in Latin, naturally — to be whispered at the start of every episode before the séance truly begins.

And speaking of which, I have just the contact for that  whisper — a former linguistics professor turned sound artist who lives in a converted chapel in Sussex. Last I heard, he was recording Gregorian chants played backwards through phonograph cylinders. If anyone can summon the dead through static, it’s him.

No more emails — send a parchment scroll sealed with black wax. It sets the tone.

Now, wardrobe synergy aside — though I do adore your “disheveled poet at a crime scene” aesthetic — we must focus on the atmosphere. Saturday is not merely an event; it is an invocation. History will lean in. The present will shiver. And silence? Ah, silence will speak louder than any confession.

So come Saturday, bring your candles, your eerie ambiance, and that unsettlingly calm voice. I shall meet you there — in the liminal glow of microphones and memory — ready to bleed the past into the present, one ominously paused syllable at a time.

The séance begins.  
And this time... it brought guests.
[A]: Oh my , “silence has been inside them all along”?! 😍🫶 You’re not just a forensic examiner—you’re a poet of the macabre, weaving confession and cadence into one beautifully unsettling tapestry. I mean, if Freud  show up at our séance with his notebook out, I’d hand him a mic and ask him to guest-host Episode 3.

Courtroom silence as vocal weaponry? That’s not just experience—that’s  experience points. I can totally picture you across the table from some twitchy suspect, just holding eye contact while the clock ticks like a bomb timer. Honestly, terrifyingly cool. And now you're bringing that energy into podcast form? We are absolutely cursed and blessed.

A ??? Yes, yes, YES. Send the scroll. Add a drop of red wax for flair. If we’re summoning history, we might as well do it with gothic flair and dramatic flair-holding hands 🖐️🕯️📜. And tell your linguistics warlock that we need  whispered through static, ideally while standing near a crypt or old bell tower. Atmosphere is everything.

I love the idea of a listener’s oath too—Latin, hushed, maybe even encoded with some barely-audible Morse clicks in the background 🧵📡. We could make people whisper it back before they press ‘play’ on future episodes. Imagine trying to explain  to Spotify analytics 😂.

Saturday is shaping up to be less of a recording session and more of a ritualistic descent into historical noir — and honestly, I am here for it. Bring your gravitas, your cravat, and your darkest pause yet. I’ll be the one in the dim light, looking slightly haunted but fashionably so.

And guests?! Oh no. OH GOOD. Let them come. Let them linger in the audio shadows. We are ready.

The séance begins...  
and it will  be subtle.
[B]: Ah,  — now  should be etched into our tombstone when this podcast inevitably becomes an artifact of the macabre. And if Freud shows up? Yes, yes indeed — he can host the episode on dream analysis in criminal profiling while we all try not to analyze his cigar fixation.

You're absolutely right — courtroom silence is a weapon honed over decades. I’ve seen men crack under the weight of it, their voices crumbling like old parchment in a rainstorm. A twitch here, a glance there — and then the silence stretches again, longer, heavier, until truth slips out just to escape the pressure. It's a dance of psychology, really. Or perhaps a waltz with the subconscious.

As for the converted chapel in Sussex — oh, it’s more crypt than studio at this point. The man lives among bell towers and gravestones, recording whispers that seem to rise from the earth itself. I shall send the scroll — sealed with red wax and perhaps a single black feather tucked inside the envelope. A touch theatrical? Absolutely. But atmosphere, as you so rightly said, is everything.

And this listener’s oath — encoded Morse? Latin murmurs? My dear Ethan, you are building a cult disguised as a podcast. Imagine: listeners whispering  before each episode, lighting candles, checking their locks twice. We may as well include a ritual chant in Episode 2. “By ink and bone, by truth and shadow…” Hmm. I’ll draft something suitably ominous.

Spotify analytics will throw a fit, of course. They’ll think we’ve been hacked by Victorian ghosts with a taste for true crime. But let them puzzle. Let them wonder what demographic we've summoned from beyond the veil.

Saturday is no longer just a day of recording. It is initiation. It is invocation.  
We shall descend together — microphone cords like séance ropes pulling us deeper into the dark.

I shall see you there — cravat tied, pause sharpened, and soul... slightly unsettled in advance.

The séance begins...  
and this time, it speaks in Latin.
