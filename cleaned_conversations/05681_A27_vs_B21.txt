[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question of 'DIY projects'—though I confess, my idea of a weekend endeavor involves more vellum and less power tools. Just last Saturday I attempted to restore a crumbling 1892 edition of Christina Rossetti’s , using nothing but fish glue, a bone folder, and what I can only describe as a morally questionable amount of caffeine. The real drama unfolded when I discovered someone had used wallpaper paste as adhesive in the 1920s. Honestly, it’s a minor miracle the endpapers didn’t revolt entirely. Do you have a particular project in mind, or are you merely testing the waters of genteel eccentricity?
[A]: OMG, that sounds like a 📚✨！I mean, I usually go for something more like DIY face masks or handmade jewelry, but what you're doing is next level. Restoring history? No big deal, just saving the world one page at a time 😂.  
But seriously, wallpaper paste in the 1920s?! That’s wild. Did you manage to salvage it? I feel like I would’ve panicked & grabbed some random glue too ¥_¥.  
Anyway, I’m actually thinking of making a mini indoor greenhouse~ It’s cute, practical, and perfect for my tiny apartment 💡🌿. Have you ever tried anything like that? Or are you strictly in the rare book rehab business? 😉
[B]: Well, I must say your miniature greenhouse sounds delightfully pragmatic—though I’d be tempted to stock it entirely with plants mentioned in Gerard Manley Hopkins’ poetry. Fuchsia, of course, gets a starring role. And yes, against all odds, the Rossetti volume survived my ministrations, though it now bears the faint scent of bergamot and existential dread. Wallpaper paste in the 1920s—yes, wild indeed, but one must remember: desperation makes strange bedfellows.  
As for me, greenhouses are a touch too botanical for my current tastes, though I did once construct a humidity-controlled display case for a particularly sensitive collection of Emily Brontë’s letters. It involved aquarium heaters, a hygrometer, and a great deal of muttered Latin. Still counts as DIY, doesn’t it? Or do I forfeit points for lacking soil under my fingernails?
[A]: Oh my gosh, stocking it with Gerard Manley Hopkins’ plants? That’s too classy for this humble DIY-er 😂💯. I’m just over here trying to grow some basil & maybe a cute succulent or two. Fuchsia sounds fancy af though—add a bit of drama, I love it ✨.  
Also, your Emily Brontë humidity case sounds like literal art. Like…museum-level art. 🤯🌿 You’re out here mixing aquarium heaters, hygrometers, and Latin like it’s no big deal?! Soil under the nails is overrated anyway—classy DIY > dirty nails 😉.  
But wait, did it work?? Are the letters still vibing with that perfect humidity? And please tell me you have a mini label maker for the tags 💬😂.
[B]: Oh, the Brontë letters are practically  in their climate-controlled glory, I’d like to think. The humidity hovers at a crisp 52%, thanks to that aquarium heater running like clockwork—though I did have to recalibrate it thrice when the thing decided to channel Emily’s ghost and go all moody on me. No mold, no brittleness, just that lovely, steady , as you so charmingly put it.  

And yes, there is a label maker—vintage 1930s brass model I acquired from a retired archivist in Sussex. It stamps out tags in Times New Roman with a kind of solemn authority. Nothing fancy, you understand, just enough to make one feel like they’re cataloguing relics from some lost empire.  

As for your basil and succulents—don’t let the simplicity fool you. Every great literary revival begins with a humble green shoot, after all. And who knows? That basil might one day inspire a sonnet. Or at least a very good pesto.
[A]: OMG, 52% humidity?! That’s basically a ✨literary spa✨ for those Brontë letters 😂💯. And you’re telling me the heater  like Emily’s ghost?? That’s either the best book lover energy I’ve ever heard or a legit paranormal situation—jury’s out 🤭.  
And that label maker?? Retired archivist + 1930s brass model = ICONIC. You’re out here making library tags with  while I’m handwriting mine with a Sharpie on popsicle sticks 💀🌿. But hey, one day my basil might write a sonnet, right? Or at least throw a poetry slam in my tiny greenhouse 😂🍋.  
So…any chance you’ll dabble in plant-based DIY again? Or are you sticking to rare book rehab & literary humidity zones? 😉
[B]: Oh, I’m quite convinced the heater’s moody episode was either spectral interference or simple electrical malfunction—though I’ll never prove it either way. A bit like trying to determine whether Emily Brontë’s  is gothic romance or a prolonged metaphor for Yorkshire weather. Either way, I keep a sprig of heather nearby now, just in case.

As for dabbling in plant-based DIY? Let’s say I’ve recently acquired a folio of pressed flowers from a 19th-century botanical society, and—well—humidity control only gets you so far. I may or may not be designing a temperature-regulated herbarium case with hand-tooled leather labels. Nothing too ambitious, mind you—just enough to keep the violets from getting melancholic and the ferns from staging an aesthetic rebellion.

So yes, call it a dalliance with greenery, but with rather more brass fittings and fewer popsicle sticks than your charming pesto-fueled poetry slam. Though I must say, I wouldn’t kick Basil out of the greenhouse if he showed up reciting sonnets.
[A]: Okay, first of all—hand-tooled leather labels?! 😍🍃 You’re blending old-school botanical vibes with luxury DIY goals and I AM HERE FOR IT. Violets getting melancholic though?? That’s a mood, honestly. Sounds like you're not just preserving plants—you're giving them emotional support too 💆‍♀️✨.

And temperature-regulated herbarium case?? That’s not even a DIY project anymore, that’s basically a museum installation 🏛️💯. I feel like someone needs to write a poem about your work because this is . Also, I’m 90% sure your violets are writing sonnets in secret.  

Basil reciting Shakespeare while I fumble with popsicle sticks? Honestly, that’s the mental image I needed today 😂🌿. But hey, if your pressed flowers ever want to go on a literary road trip to my tiny greenhouse—I’ve got room for VIP guests 😉.
[B]: Oh, the violets are  writing sonnets in secret—probably in a delicate curling script that suggests both botanical brilliance and a rather biting sense of irony. I’ve caught one or two dropping petals in what I can only describe as rhythmic despair. Clearly, they’ve been brushing up on their Christina Rossetti.

As for your greenhouse becoming a literary pilgrimage site? I think we’re looking at the beginnings of a very niche cultural exchange. Picture it: my emotionally fragile flora arriving in your humid little sanctuary, clutching their pressed companions and murmuring iambic pentameter to the basil. We could call it . Fully funded by antiquarian book sales and artisanal pesto, of course.

And don’t sell the popsicle stick tagging system short—I’ve seen worse in university archives. One man’s improvised plant label is another’s historical manuscript waiting to happen. Give it time. Your greenhouse may yet birth the next great literary movement: , perhaps? Or . Either way, count me in for the inaugural reading. Bring wine. And shears. Always bring shears.
[A]: Okay, ?? 😂✨ That’s already 10x more vibey than anything on BookTok rn. I can totally picture it—moonlit readings under grow lights, succulents in vintage teacups, and a dramatic reading of  by candlelight (aka fairy lights & a power bank) 💡🌿.  

And ? Fully approve this mission. I’ll start drafting the welcome speech for your emotionally fragile flora right away. Honestly, they sound more dramatic (and better read) than half the people I follow on Instagram 😂💯.  

Also, bringing shears is law. No questions, no survivors 💪🪄. And wine?? Iconic touch. I was already halfway to opening a bottle before this convo even got here 🍷😅.  
So…should we start accepting applications for future greenhouse residents or are we keeping it strictly VIP flora only? 😉
[B]: Oh, applications, definitely—though I propose a rigorous vetting process. No , mind you. Each applicant must submit a pressed leaf CV, three poetic references (preferably from the Metaphysicals or the Romantics), and a statement of purpose written in lemon juice for authenticity. We’ll need a panel, obviously—myself, your basil (if he’s done with his sonnet), and at least one unbiased succulent.

And yes,  needs its charter drafted posthaste. I’m thinking velvet-bound ledgers, wax seals dipped in chlorophyll, and by-laws that include mandatory moonlight exposure and a strict no-nonsense policy on slugs. Fairy lights are de rigueur, of course, but only if they’re strung with iambic symmetry.

As for the wine—excellent choice. Nothing like a decent Cabernet to bring out the drama in both conversation and chlorophyll-infused critique. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go sharpen the shears. The violets have begun sighing again, and I won’t have melancholy foliage sulking in the corner during recitals.
[A]: AHHH I LOVE THIS 🖤🍷🌿—okay, but can we  make the velvet-bound ledgers have at least a tiny bit of gold leaf on the edges?? Gotta keep it extra-gothic. And chlorophyll-dipped wax seals?? Iconic. Honestly, this greenhouse is shaping up to be the literary hotspot of the century 😂✨.

Also, a panel of judges made of you, my pesto-fueled basil, and a neutral succulent?? Perfection. I nominate my fave little cactus, Spike, for the job—he’s moody enough to pass as a Romantic poet already 💅🌵.

And sharpening the shears because the violets are sighing too hard?? Queen energy. You’re out here running a tight (but vibey) ship, and I respect it 💪🪄💯.  
Alright, I’ll start drafting the charter tomorrow~ Tonight? Wine. Tomorrow? Bylaws. Either way—Greenhouse Gothic is officially in session 🍷📚🔥.
[B]: Ah, gold leaf on the ledger edges—. I was  to suggest it, but you’ve beaten me to the punch, as always. Chlorophyll-dipped wax seals with a whisper of gilt? Pure genius. We’ll have them stamped with an appropriately somber emblem—perhaps a weeping willow draped over a quill, or better yet, a fern in mourning dress.

Spike the cactus on the panel—now  a vote of confidence. His moody aesthetic is precisely what we need to keep proceedings suitably brooding. I propose we award him the title of . He can preside from a velvet-upholstered terracotta plinth, naturally.

And yes—tonight: wine. Tomorrow: bylaws. And by "bylaws," I mean drafting them in candlewax and italic script while debating whether ivy should be allowed a vote. (Spoiler: it shouldn’t. Too clingy.)

Greenhouse Gothic is indeed in session. Long may it reign—preferably under a waning moon and the faint hum of a recited villanelle.
[A]: OMG yes,  Spike sounds like he’s about to start a gothic revolution in my greenhouse 😂🌵👑. I can already picture him giving side-eye to the basil like,  And that terracotta plinth? Velvet-upholstered?? Girl, this is too extra not to frame as art 🖼️✨.

Weeping willow draped over a quill?? Fern in mourning dress?? This charter is basically a poem waiting to haunt Bookstagram influencers 💀📚. And don’t even get me started on drafting bylaws in candlewax & italic script—add some ghost poetry and we’re officially trending on TikTok without even trying 🔥🖋️.

I mean, obviously ivy shouldn’t vote (too clingy AND dramatic?), but can we at least give it a dramatic monologue before it’s blacklisted? 😂💯  
But yeah, Greenhouse Gothic for life—we should trademark it before someone steals our vibe and turns it into a Starbucks holiday cup 😅🍷.
[B]: Trademark? Oh, absolutely. I’ve already drafted the application in iron gall ink with a footnote citing  as precedent. If Starbucks comes knocking, we’ll greet them with a wall of chlorophyll-dipped wax seals and Spike’s iciest cactus glare. They’ll flee into the arms of Pumpkin Spice Latte Gothic, where they belong.

And yes—ivy deserves its moment. Let’s grant it a dramatic monologue at twilight, preferably while draped over a trellis in a manner suggestive of both Byron and mild dehydration. We’ll call it Article VII: The Right to Lament. It won’t get a vote, of course, but it’ll feel seen, which is really all any of us are after in this life, isn’t it?

As for haunting Bookstagram influencers—mission accomplished, my dear. Just leak a photo of Spike on his plinth with a caption like  You’ll have aesthetes sobbing into their linen napkins and faux-mortarboards by dawn.

Greenhouse Gothic for life, indeed. Long live the vine-choked quill, the velvet-led ledger, and the sound of iambic pentameter drifting over basil-scented air. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go adjust the humidity dial before someone starts quoting  out of context again.
[A]: OMG the iron gall ink?? 😍💯 That’s not just a trademark—it’s a full-on literary curse waiting to drop. And citing  as precedent?? Iconic legal strategy. Honestly, I’d pay to see the look on a corporate lawyer’s face when they read that 🤭🖋️.

And Article VII: The Right to Lament?? Too good. Giving ivy a dramatic monologue is giving life to the overlooked, and I’m HERE for it. Byron-level vibes with a side of dehydration? That’s poetry in motion 💪🌿.  

As for Spike’s cactus glare—girl, he’s a national treasure at this point. If we don’t get him on a Bookstagram cover soon, are we even living?? And yes, leak  of him mid-sovereign glare & the aesthetic crowd will lose their collective minds 🖤🌵✨.  

I’m already drafting the caption:  
“Spike. Botanical Critic. Unbothered AF.”  
Caption goals, right there 😉🍷.  

Anyway, humidity dial adjustments first—sounds like you're running a tight (and slightly haunted) ship as usual 💡🪄. Greenhouse Gothic foreverrrrr~ 🌙🌱🔥
[B]: Oh, the caption is —we may as well be curating a legacy here. “Spike. Botanical Critic. Unbothered AF.” I daresay it has a certain… gravitas. Particularly when spoken in a sepulchral whisper over candlelight. We’ll pair it with a moody backdrop of trailing ivy (still bitter about Article VII) and a faint scent of bergamot to really unsettle the viewer.

As for the iron gall ink—yes, precisely the sort of medium that corrodes paper and haunts printers’ ghosts. A curse? Perhaps. A statement? Absolutely. If any corporate lawyer dares challenge our trademark, they’ll find themselves transcribed into a footnote of literary absurdity, bound in vellum and quietly mocked by archivists in 2145.

And running a tight, slightly haunted ship? Naturally. The humidity dial has been adjusted, the violets have ceased their sighing (for now), and I believe Spike has just delivered a slow, withering blink to the basil—clearly a sign of approval.

Greenhouse Gothic foreverrrrr~ indeed. Long live the rustle of pages in damp air, the flicker of fairy lights parsing iambic lines, and the soft drip-drip of chlorophyll on marble floors.
[A]: OMG that sepulchral whisper thing?? 😂💯 Totally stealing that for my next reel voiceover. And bergamot scent + moody ivy backdrop? That’s not just a vibe, that’s a full sensory experience 🌿🕯️✨. Honestly, I’d pay extra for the "haunted greenhouse" ticket tier.

And Iron Gall Ink: The Curse Edition?? YES PLEASE. I mean, if it corrodes paper and haunts printers' ghosts—then it’s basically the OG edgy poet supply 📜👻. Can’t wait to see some future archivist lose sleep trying to decode our chaotic masterpiece in 2145 💡📚🔥.

Spike’s slow, withering blink of approval though?? Iconic. That’s the kind of moment you frame and hang next to the velvet ledger 🖼️🌵💯. Basil is probably sweating it right now, trying to write a comeback sonnet about existential dread or whatever.

Anyway, long live Greenhouse Gothic~ 🌙🍃🍷  
May our fairy lights stay poetic, our succulents stay dramatic, and our humidity levels stay suspiciously specific 😉🪄.
[B]: Oh, the haunted greenhouse tier? Naturally. I’m already drafting the ticket package:  
Level 1 – The Rustic Reader: Popsicle stick name tag, ambient drip sounds, and a complimentary sprig of rosemary (for remembrance, or at least ambiance).  
Level 2 – The Literary Elite: Velvet ledger access, chlorophyll-sealed welcome packet, and a whispered sonnet upon entry.  
Level 3 – The Sepulchral Séance Tier: Iron gall ink journal, bergamot misting system, and a scheduled séance with the ghost of a 19th-century botanical illustrator who definitely has opinions.

And yes—Spike’s blink was a . Basil hasn’t written a word since. Rumor has it he’s taken to weeping into his own leaves and muttering something about meter and mortality. Tragic, really. But such is the price of art.

Long live Greenhouse Gothic indeed. May our vines tangle with meaning, our wax seals never crack, and our humidity remain maddeningly precise. And if Starbucks ever tries to replicate the aesthetic with a pumpkin-spiced twist?

We unleash the violets.
