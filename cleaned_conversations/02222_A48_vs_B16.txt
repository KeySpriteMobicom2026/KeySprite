[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, if I could choose a superpower, it would definitely be the ability to manipulate time~ ☕️⏳ Not just so I can have an extra hour in the morning for my coffee ritual, but also to pause moments that matter - like when you're tasting an amazing dish or enjoying a beautiful sunset somewhere exotic. Imagine being able to extend those perfect moments forever! 

Actually, this ties back to my work too - sometimes clients wish they had more hours in the day. While I can't literally give them more time, I help them optimize what they have through personalized lifestyle design. It's like giving them a mini-time-superpower in real life! ✨ What about you? If you could pick any superpower, what would make your daily life extraordinary?
[A]: Hmm, interesting choice! I've always been fascinated by time manipulation too - though my interest is probably more morbid. 🕰️💀 Imagine being able to rewind just far enough to prevent a crime... or having to decide whether to let a serial killer live because you might catch them again? 

But honestly? If I had to pick one superpower for my line of work, it'd be the ability to hear people's final thoughts at the moment of death. Think about it - victims could literally point out their killers. No more cold cases, no more unsolved mysteries. Just a direct witness account from beyond the grave.  Though I suppose that would make me pretty unpopular at parties...

Actually, there's something almost like this in forensic psychology called "death disclosure" - when victims somehow leave clues pointing to their killer. Ever heard of the case where a woman carved her attacker's initial into her skin during her last moments? Incredible how the human mind works under pressure, right? So what do you think - does my morbid superpower beat your time bending? 😏
[B]: Okay, let's see... You definitely win the prize for most intriguing superpower concept! 🕵️‍♂️ Your idea is both brilliant and chilling at the same time. I can totally imagine you in some crime drama TV show solving cases that seem impossible. Though yeah, party conversations might get awkward when you casually mention "Oh, by the way, how would your final thoughts sound?" 😂

Your comparison to death disclosure is fascinating though - it shows how sometimes reality can be more intense than fiction. That case with the attacker's initial carved into skin? Chilling and impressive simultaneously. It makes me wonder about what other hidden capabilities humans have yet to discover without actual superpowers.

But here's a thought - if we combine our powers metaphorically speaking: my time manipulation (in the form of optimizing schedules and routines) with your truth-revealing ability (translating to understanding people's deepest needs), we'd make an amazing team helping clients transform their lives. I could give them more quality time while you help them understand what truly matters. Deal? ✨🤝✨ 

(Though I'll admit - having to listen to people's final thoughts about what they should've ordered for dinner might not be quite as helpful...)
[A]: Deal accepted - we'd make a terrifyingly effective duo. 😈 Let's call our partnership ... or maybe something less likely to make clients faint before their first appointment? 

You know, combining powers makes me think of this case I worked on last year - victim had scheduled her own memorial service through an app that automatically sends emails after biometric signals stop. Talk about time-stamped truth! If only she'd had your skills for optimizing fate... she might've postponed that particular deadline. 

And don't get me started on final meal thoughts - I once had a guy who spent his last three minutes composing a haiku about cafeteria lasagna. Completely useless for solving his case, but oddly poetic. 🧪✍️

So when do we start hiring for the world's most disturbing dream team? I'll bring the autopsy reports, you bring the time management spreadsheets?
[B]: Oh, I love how darkly enthusiastic you are about this! 🤭 We could totally rebrand as  - sounds more... approachable? Maybe? 😂 Although if we're going the subtle route, perhaps just "T2 Consultancy"? Let people wonder what the second T stands for until they're already signed on the dotted line.

That memorial service app story gives me chills in the most fascinating way - talk about planning ahead! It makes me want to develop a client strategy where we optimize not just daily routines but also life's final chapters. You handle the exit interviews and I'll make sure their legacy runs like clockwork. Perfect synergy!

And poetic lasagna haiku? That's someone I'd want to have coffee with - preferably before their final brew ☕️ although now I'm imagining post-mortem poetry journals filling up my inbox. Hmm, maybe we should add "selective reception" to my time powers?

As for hiring - shall we start with a press release next Tuesday at 3pm? I'll block the time in my calendar for chaos planning... unless you'd prefer to rewind to an earlier date? 😉
[A]: Selective reception? Oh, I love it. We’re basically building a metaphysical spam filter for the soul. 🧠🚫💀 Sign me up as Chief Filter Engineer - I’ll make sure all incoming existential dread gets sorted into the junk folder. Imagine the peace of mind! 

And T2 Consultancy sounds perfect - mysterious enough to intrigue, vague enough to avoid panic attacks during elevator pitches. Though I’m still voting we add a third silent partner named Chaos to really round out the trio. Clients would walk in expecting life hacks and leave questioning their entire reality. Ideal.

As for your calendar suggestion... 3pm Tuesday is far too predictable for temporal experimentation. How about we schedule our launch at ? That way we technically aren't bound by this dimension's laws of physics. Or...we could just meet after my next autopsy. The cadaver room has such a lovely atmosphere for brainstorming. 💀📈

Coffee with lasagna-poet guy sounds delightful - though I’d suggest bringing earplugs in case he starts reciting from beyond the grave. Final drafts are always so overrated anyway.
[B]: Oh my god, I can already picture our business cards - T2 Consultancy with a tiny skull watermark and a tagline that reads "Time Well Spent (or Reversed, Depending on Contract Terms)" 💀⏱️

Chaos as a silent partner? Brilliant! We'll tell clients it's an AI system we developed that helps with risk assessment. Let them wonder whether it's machine learning or actual mayhem manifesting in spreadsheet form. And 12:60? Genius stroke! We should also schedule follow-up meetings at 33:17 just to keep things consistent. Clients will either be incredibly confused or spiritually enlightened - both excellent outcomes for consultation conversion rates!

As for the cadaver room ambiance... there's something undeniably inspiring about discussing time optimization while surrounded by reminders of mortality. Though I must insist we bring proper coffee - even Chaos deserves espresso when brainstorming. And earplugs? Definitely - though I'm thinking of developing a special edition branded ones that read "I survived T2's pitch meeting" 😉

So shall we say...next Tuesday, 12:60pm, location marked only as "The Intersection of Fate & Findings"? Perfectly nonsensical, wonderfully inconvenient - everything a high-end consultancy should be!
[A]:  I'm officially impressed - you've elevated consultancy to an art form. Though I feel obligated to warn you: our first client is likely to be either a cult leader or a very confused tech billionaire. Possibly both. 

I'm already drafting the NDA template - it'll include a checkbox for "acknowledges exposure to time anomalies may cause existential vertigo". And the branded earplugs? Pure genius. We'll offer them as referral bonuses. 

 Funny story - turns out scheduling at 12:60 causes actual temporal instability in my office. Who knew? But great news! The cadaver lab has agreed to host us if we promise not to disturb the "quiet hours". Though honestly, have you seen how productive we get when mildly disturbed by maintenance staff?

Oh and one tiny suggestion - can we add  in the fine print? Important legal protection there. 

So yes - next Tuesday, 12:60pm, at the aforementioned intersection. Bring your best espresso and absolutely no expectations about linear reality.  This is going to be glorious.
[B]:  Ah, existential vertigo - the ultimate luxury experience! Only the finest clientele can afford that level of mind-bending service. And cult leaders make excellent referrals, don't they? Though we'll need to screen them carefully - no doomsday prophets who want to "reset" civilization before their morning matcha. Professional boundaries, right?

Your NDA game is strong - though I'm thinking of adding an extra clause: "Client agrees to refrain from developing romantic feelings for their former/potential/future selves encountered during time optimization sessions". Trust me, it's not a hypothetical scenario. We consultants have魅力, and temporal doppelgängers are particularly... persuasive.

And about that cadaver lab - perfect touch! There's something deliciously poetic about solving life's problems in a space that reminds you failure is permanent. Though I must insist we invest in better lighting. Even Chaos deserves ambiance when crunching fate metrics.

As for lasagna haiku regrets... Noted! Though honestly, some things should remain unsolved. Poetry is safer than timelines, after all.

12:60 it is then - bring your best espresso AND your emergency supply of sanity. I have a feeling we'll be needing both... and possibly more coffee than is medically advisable. This is going to be legendary 🚀☕️
[A]: Ah, but what about clients who  to fall for their temporal doppelgängers? Should we offer that as an upsell? 💘🌀 "Romantic entanglements across timelines - $199.99 per hour, extra charge for paradox resolution." Though honestly, I’ve seen less chaos in a morgue during a hurricane.

And lighting in the cadaver lab? Let’s go full ambiance - dim, moody, with just the right amount of forensic fluorescence. It’s the perfect balance between inspiration and mild existential dread. We’ll even play soft jazz over the bone saw hum. Classy yet... unsettling.

Speaking of unsolved things - poetry is only safer if you don’t read too deep, my friend. Ever met someone who wrote love sonnets in their final breath? No? Well, let’s keep it that way. Final words should stay mysterious, like horoscopes written in blood. 🕯️🔪

As for the espresso? I’ll bring a thermos of black gold and a side of caffeine pills. If we’re bending time, we’re doing it wide awake. And slightly jittery. Legend status guaranteed by 12:60 sharp. See you on the other side of sanity. ☕🔥
[B]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true T2 consultant! 💞 We'll call it our "Love Across Time" package - romance your past/present/future self with professional guidance. Of course, we'll include mandatory counseling sessions to prevent any... unfortunate incidents involving clients trying to elope with their younger selves. And the jazz-over-bone-saw ambiance? Pure genius. We'll market it as "Where Chopin meets pathology - and your life goals get dissected."

I'm already drafting the brochure:  📖✨ Complete with a disclaimer that reads "Not responsible for clients who decide their best romantic match is a version of themselves who still believes in love." 

And horoscopes written in blood? Chillingly poetic! Though I must insist we keep all divination services strictly metaphorical. We want to be mysterious, not arrested.

Count me in on that espresso deal - though I'll bring an extra thermos just in case. There's no such thing as "too jittery" when you're launching a consultancy that bends time, dances with death, and occasionally flirts with chaos. 

See you at 12:60 sharp then - fully caffeinated, gloriously unhinged, and ready to redefine what it means to live your best life... or several.
[A]:  Oh, we're not just consultants anymore - we're lifestyle architects of the impossible. And let's be honest, elopement prevention counseling is where the real profit lies. Premium package includes a guided session on "Why Marrying Your Temporal Self Constitutes Philosophical Bigamy." Charge extra for tears - both emotional and paradox-related.

Brochure idea? Gold. Though I'm picturing something slightly more...macabre. Maybe a photo of two shadowy figures dancing through clock gears, one holding a coffee cup shaped like a skull. Tagline: 

As for horoscope disclaimers - relax, we'll just call it "artistic interpretation of biological patterns." Forensic pathology meets modern art! Though I do appreciate your concern about arrests. Let’s hire a lawyer who specializes in temporal ethics...or better yet, convince one to join us with promises of untangling causality knots. 

Double espresso thermos confirmed. I’ll even pack little commemorative cups that read “I temporally survived T2.” And by 12:60 sharp, I expect you fully caffeinated, gloriously unbound by convention, and ready to pitch to our first client – who, judging by the vibe, will either be a billionaire or a goat. Possibly both. 🕰️🔥💼
[B]:  My dear partner in consultancy chaos, you’ve officially elevated our brand to dangerously seductive levels. 💼🔮 Billionaire or goat, I say we offer a tiered pricing model: one for those who measure wealth in currency, and another for those who value...  ...existential clarity and/or hoof-related wisdom.

That brochure vision? Perfection! Though let’s make the coffee cup skull look suspiciously like it’s winking. We’ll market it as “espresso esoteric” – only the initiated truly understand the roast notes of fate. And tears as a premium service? Pure business genius. Honestly, we should trademark the phrase: 

Temporal ethics lawyer? Nah. Let’s just write our own rules and call it “Consultancy Philosophy with Benefits.” If anyone questions us, we’ll hand them a paradox clause and tell them to read it three times under a full moon. By then they’ll either be enlightened or too dizzy to object.

Double espresso thermos + commemorative cups = confirmed. I might even add a tiny hourglass engraved on each one so clients can watch their sanity slip away in real time. 🕰️☕

And yes – goat or billionaire, we take them all. After all, isn’t every successful partnership built on equal parts ambition, caffeine, and a healthy disregard for the space-time continuum?
[A]:  Ah, now you're speaking my language - where ambition meets absurdity and every invoice is basically performance art. Tiered pricing? Brilliant. We'll have the "Basic Billionaire Package" which includes one hour of time manipulation consultation and a complimentary vial of  essence of mortality. Then our "Hoof Wisdom Elite Tier" comes with all that plus a live goat consultant who judges your life choices from across the room. Clients will  for that kind of authenticity.

And that winking skull coffee cup? I'm imagining it subtly morphing expressions depending on how many paradoxes we create before lunch. You're right - we  to trademark "Emotional Excess Charged Separately." Maybe offer a bundle deal: cry now, pay later. 💔💸

Consultancy Philosophy with Benefits? Oh, I love it. Let’s print faux-legal contracts filled with clauses like  and  Full disclosure, zero accountability.

Tiny hourglass engraved cups? Perfection. I’ll get Chaos to sand-carve them during his lunch break between rewriting causality and filing tax loopholes. 

So yes, let's do it. Billionaires, goats, confused cult leaders - all welcome. After all, what's life without a little caffeine-fueled chaos?  To T2 Consultancy - may we never run out of espresso or ethical ambiguity. Cheers! ☕⚖️🔥
[B]:  To T2 Consultancy - where every meeting is part therapy session, part time heist planning, and entirely unforgettable! 🥂✨

I'm already drafting the website copy: 

And that goat consultant idea? Revolutionary. We’ll market it as “Hoof Wisdom Sessions” – clients will pay double just to figure out if the head nodding means "yes" or "you’ve made a terrible life choice." Maybe add a tiny bell around its neck for dramatic effect. Ding once for fate, twice for disaster.

Chaos handling tax loopholes? Chef’s kiss. Honestly, I can’t wait for our first 5-star Yelp review that reads: 

Cheers to us, partner-in-temporal-crime – may our espresso flow endlessly, our contracts remain gloriously vague, and our goat advisor never stop judging. Here's to rewriting fate, one paradox at a time. ☕🌀🖋️
[A]:  To paradoxes well-written and fates gently nudged off their intended paths! 🥂🌀 Oh, the website copy is gold - though I’m adding a “Frequently Unasked Questions” section. Top entry:  Response: 

And the goat? Oh, we’re going full mystic animal consultant. We’ll train it to stare deeply into clients’ souls while slowly chewing... something ominous. Probably paperwork. The bell idea? Inspired. Though let’s make it a  bell. Ding once for fate, twice for financial ruin, thrice for "why did I leave my house today?"

I can already picture our Yelp reviews:  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️   
⭐️⭐️   
⭐️ 

Espresso flows, contracts stay gloriously vague, and yes—our goat advisor shall judge eternally. And mildly disapprovingly. 🐐⚖️☕

To T2 Consultancy – may we never be fully understood, always be slightly overbooked, and forever dance just outside the reach of linear sanity. Cheers, my partner in consultancy madness! 🕰️🔥💼
[B]:  🤭 Ah, the FAQ section genius! I’m already drafting more:  
 – Only if they enjoy paradoxes and/or spontaneous metaphysical identity crises.  
 – No, but we do offer shared existential dread at no extra charge.  

And the goat’s soul-staring routine? We’ll call it  – Latin for “you’re about to confront your life choices while being quietly judged by farm equipment.” Training manual is basically just pictures of you scowling over case files. The skull bell idea? Iconic. Honestly, clients will be too distracted wondering if it's real bone to ask difficult questions.

Yelp reviews are gold – though I think we should feature them prominently on our homepage. Maybe under a banner that reads  And yes, the 1-star review complaining everything’s on fire but beautifully synchronized? That’s going on our LinkedIn page. Pure branding magic.

To T2 Consultancy – may we remain gloriously ungoogleable, ethically ambiguous, and perpetually caffeinated. To bending time, dodging logic, and letting goats decide who’s worthy of enlightenment. You, my friend, are a visionary. And possibly a liability.  

But hey — isn’t that what legends are made of? ☕🔥🌀🚀

Cheers, partner. Let’s make Tuesday far too weird to survive… or forget.
[A]:  Ah, the chaos is already setting in beautifully. 🧨☕️ And your FAQ? Perfection. Let’s add one more:  Answer: 

Capra Insight™ – yes, trademark that immediately. We’ll market it as “the only farm-to-fable consultancy experience available without a referral from your therapist (though we highly recommend one).” And honestly, if I  the training manual, let’s go all-in. Frame my scowling face next to ominous Latin phrases like  and 

Homepage banner idea? Genius. "Results May Vary (Seriously)" should be in bold, preferably bleeding slightly for effect. And the 1-star review on LinkedIn? Pure marketing sorcery. We’ll caption it: 

Gloriously ungoogleable? Ethically ambiguous? Liability-level dangerous? Yes please. Legend status unlocked. 🚀⚖️ And if Tuesday  implodes under the weight of our temporal meddling, well… that’s just great word-of-mouth.

Cheers, partner. To madness, method, and just the right amount of mayhem. ☕🔥🌀💼  
Let’s make time wish it never messed with us.
[B]:  Oh, we’re not just legends in the making — we’re full-blown myth architects. 🏛️✨ And that FAQ addition?  Let's print it on parchment that slightly changes wording when read under candlelight. Clients will swear it's either genius marketing or a minor curse — and honestly, let them wonder.

Capra Insight™ branding? I’m thinking dramatic photoshoot with mist, low-angle lighting, and the goat staring directly into your soul while chewing... is that a birth certificate? Nah, don’t tell me — ignorance is our brand aesthetic now. And Latin phrases bleeding into each other? Iconic. We’ll call it  — perfect for clients who like their wisdom slightly confusing and moderately terrifying.

Homepage? I’ve already hired Chaos as our web designer. The homepage loads upside-down, scrolls sideways, and features the goat blinking at irregular intervals. There’s no contact form — just a riddle:  If they get it right, they get a coupon. If not? They still pay for the session.

And if Tuesday implodes? Brilliant. We’ll reschedule at 12:60 on a parallel Earth where everything is slightly more haunted. Contingency planning is just another word for elegant chaos.

Cheers, partner. To myth, to madness, and to the goat that sees all. ☕🔮🐐  
Let us bend time so beautifully it forgets how to resist.
