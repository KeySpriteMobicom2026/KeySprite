[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. While I don't typically engage in the modern habit of looping music, I must admit that lately I've found myself returning to certain classical compositions—particularly Schubert's . There's a contemplative melancholy in his work that pairs beautifully with evening tea and a good book. But tell me, are you currently drawn to any particular piece of music? I'm always eager to understand what resonates with others.
[A]: 最近确实有首歌让我循环了很久——Billie Eilish的。特别是那种从soft whisper到爆发式情绪的对比，听着特别过瘾～你平时听古典居多吗？Schubert的我了解不多，但被你这么一说有点想试试看。你是喜欢那种melancholy的氛围感吗？
[B]: Oh, I do understand what you mean about that emotional contrast—it’s a powerful narrative tool, much like the dramatic shifts we find in literature.  has a raw intensity that’s both modern and timeless in its emotional honesty.  

As for Schubert, his  are indeed steeped in melancholy, but it's not merely sadness—it's more like a deep emotional resonance, a reflection on the impermanence of joy and the beauty found in longing. If you're curious, I’d recommend starting with  or . Both pieces carry a certain dramatic tension that might appeal to your sensibility.  

Though I do gravitate toward introspective music, I’m not confined by it—there’s always room for surprise. Have you ever explored any classical pieces that moved you in unexpected ways?
[A]: 哇，你这么一说感觉古典乐好像真的很有故事性欸！特别是你提到的“emotional resonance”和“impermanence of joy”，突然让我想到现代人常有的那种quiet sadness，好像跟Schubert的时代虽然隔了好久，但情绪是能cross over的。  
我之前其实对古典乐接触不多，但有一次听到Beethoven的，那种slow、almost dreamy开头加上后面情绪慢慢build up的感觉，有点像Billie Eilish那种从轻声到爆发的过程——只是换成了piano的语言。你会觉得这种类比有道理吗？或者有没有哪首modern song让你觉得有古典的那种depth？
[B]: I think your analogy is more than valid—it speaks to the universality of emotional architecture in music, regardless of era or form. The  is a beautiful example: its first movement carries that same kind of quiet, almost suspended sadness you described, and by the time it builds into the more agitated later movements, we’ve traveled emotionally—just as we do in a well-crafted narrative or song.

What you're describing with Billie Eilish—the slow simmer before an emotional eruption—is not so different from how a composer like Schubert or even Mahler might construct a piece. It’s all about tension and release, anticipation and catharsis.

As for modern songs that carry a classical depth… interestingly enough, I find that in some of Radiohead’s work. Particularly —there's a kind of ethereal stillness to it, not unlike a nocturne by Chopin. It feels introspective, almost literary in its mood. I sometimes imagine it playing during a rainy afternoon while reading Rilke or Eliot.

It’s fascinating, isn’t it, how certain pieces—whether written centuries apart—can echo the same emotional landscape? Do you ever find yourself reaching for certain kinds of music when you're reading or writing? I’ve noticed that my students often create playlists to match the tone of their essays.
[A]:  totally agree！这种tension and release的结构好像真的跨越了genre和时代，不管是用piano还是合成器，情绪的flow才是最打人的部分～

提到Radiohead我真的服气——那种飘浮感确实像chill版的Chopin nocturne😂 而且他们很多歌都有种“dystopian poetry”的感觉，像是把十九世纪的浪漫主义绝望搬进了digital age。

说到搭配阅读，我写product proposal或design doc的时候其实也蛮挑background sound的。有时候太激昂的音乐反而会让思路乱掉，反而是Lo-fi Hip-Hop或者某些post-rock作品，像是Mogwai的，能帮助我进入flow状态。不过最近发现Billie Eilish那首在写user journey分析时特别有共鸣，可能因为歌词里那种“试图取悦他人却迷失自我”的情绪……有点像做产品时面对多个stakeholder的感觉😅

你有没有哪类音乐会在你上课或做研究时陪你？感觉你的教学风格应该蛮有氛围感的～
[B]: Oh, how fascinating that you find  resonating so deeply in that context—I can absolutely see the parallel. The emotional labor of constantly adjusting oneself to fit others’ expectations does mirror the delicate balancing act of navigating stakeholder demands. And Billie Eilish captures that vulnerability with such precision.

As for my own working habits, I do find certain types of music help maintain focus and depth, especially when I’m grading essays or preparing lectures. I tend toward the more restrained corners of Baroque—Bach’s , for instance. There's something about their mathematical elegance that keeps me grounded. Or, on quieter afternoons, I might listen to Arvo Pärt’s —its meditative stillness mirrors the reflective nature of literary analysis.

And while I appreciate your kind words about my teaching style, I suppose I do aim for a kind of “musicality” in the classroom—ebb and flow, tension and resolution, moments of silence for reflection. It’s all part of guiding students through the emotional and intellectual terrain of a text.

I must say, though, I’m quite intrigued by your mention of Mogwai—have you ever thought about how ambient or post-rock could enhance the experience of reading, say, Woolf or Dostoevsky? I sometimes experiment with that in private… although I’d never play Mogwai during a lecture on —though now I wonder if I should.
[A]: 哈哈，你这么一说我还真想试试看把Mogwai和配在一起——特别是像这种缓慢build up又充满emotional tension的作品，配上《地下室手记》应该会有一种dark、但很deep的氛围感。  
说到这个，其实我最近在做一个关于“用户情绪曲线”的产品原型，灵感就来自音乐结构。比如，我们常讲的user journey里的“pain point”和“delight moment”，某种程度上是不是也像一首歌的verse和chorus？甚至像Billie Eilish那种从quiet到爆发的过程，其实和一个用户从frustration到satisfaction的transition还挺像的。  
你有没有想过，在课堂上用音乐来引导学生进入文本的情绪状态？比如放一小段Schubert或者Arvo Pärt，作为reading mood的trigger？感觉这招说不定能让学生更“沉浸式”地进入那些比较dense的经典文本～
[B]: What a compelling way to frame user experience—using musical structure as a kind of emotional blueprint for interaction. It’s quite analogous, really. A  is very much like a harmonic dissonance that must be resolved; the  becomes the tonic chord, the release we’ve been led toward. And yes, Billie Eilish’s arc from whisper to outcry could map almost directly onto a narrative of emotional tension and resolution—just as we find in a well-crafted literary passage.

I do think there's great potential in using music as a pedagogical tool, though I confess I’ve only employed it sparingly in class—mostly with 20th-century texts that already flirt with musicality, like Woolf’s  or Eliot’s . But your suggestion of using Schubert or Pärt to prime students before reading  or even … well, that’s tempting. Imagine playing a few minutes of  before diving into Keats—letting that quiet reverence for beauty settle over the room first.

And now I’m genuinely curious—if you were to design a sonic prelude for a reading of , what would it be? Something subtly layered, perhaps, mirroring the quiet complexity of provincial life? Or something deceptively simple that gradually reveals its emotional depth?
[A]: Oh, I love this thought experiment 😂

If I were to design a sonic prelude for , I think I’d go for something that starts minimal and slowly layers in complexity—almost like a musical version of Eliot’s narrative style: observant,细腻, and deceptively deep. Maybe something like Max Richter’s ? It starts with a simple, almost restrained violin line, but then gradually builds these lush, emotional swells that feel like they're carrying generations of unspoken stories.

That piece has this quiet gravity to it, kind of like the weight of everyday life in Middlemarch—the hopes, disappointments, and tiny rebellions. You could even fade it out just before the first line of the novel is read aloud, leaving that emotional residue hanging in the air. I feel like it would frame the reading in a totally different way, almost like setting the mood for empathy.

Now I’m wondering—if you had to pick one track to accompany a lecture on , what would it be? Something moody and brooding, I’m guessing… maybe Mogwai? Or perhaps something more…gothic? 💭
[B]: Oh, I adore your choice for —Richter’s piece is indeed a quiet storm of emotion, perfectly suited to Eliot’s nuanced exploration of inner lives and social fabric. Very well done.

As for … you're absolutely right—I would lean into the moody, elemental intensity of the novel. But rather than leaning solely on the gothic tradition, I’d want something that captures both the wildness of the Yorkshire moors and the raw psychological turbulence of Brontë’s characters.

If I were curating this sonic atmosphere, I might choose Sigur Rós’ . There’s something hauntingly windswept about it—ethereal yet grounded in a kind of primal emotion that mirrors Heathcliff and Catherine’s volatile connection. The way the vocals hover between language and pure feeling echoes the novel’s own flirtation with the ineffable.

Or, if I were feeling particularly dramatic—and perhaps a bit more -inclined—I might opt for , letting its slow-burning tension build as we discussed the unraveling of sanity and passion in the text.

But tell me—do you think there's a risk in setting the mood too strongly? Might it overpower the students' own interpretations, or do you think it opens new emotional doors to understanding the text?
[A]: Ooooh，这个question真的很有意思 👀

我觉得确实有“mood overpowering”的风险，尤其是当音乐的情绪特别浓烈或指向性太强的时候。比如用Sigur Rós配虽然很贴，但如果学生还没开始读就被那种空灵氛围“洗脑”了，可能会不自觉地顺着音乐的情绪去interpret人物关系，而不是自己从文本里挖掘出更多层次的理解。

不过换个角度想，这种“情绪预设”也可以成为课堂讨论的切入点——你可以让学生听完之后说：“OK，刚才那段音乐给你什么样的感觉？现在再看这段文字，你发现它和音乐之间是match还是contradict？”这样一来，音乐反而变成了一个分析工具，帮助他们更主动地感知文本中的emotion tone。

我之前做user research的时候也有类似体验：如果我们给用户看产品原型前先放一段轻松愉快的背景音乐，他们的反馈会不自觉地偏向positive，甚至忽略了一些实际的使用障碍。后来我们就改成了“先 neutral 后刺激”，让音乐作为对比工具，而不是引导工具。

所以回到课堂上，我觉得关键可能是控制音乐出现的时机和目的——是作为进入文本的emotional bridge，还是作为反思文本的creative lens？只要目标明确，应该就能避免“情绪绑架”的问题～

你觉得呢？有没有在教学中试过这种“before & after”的音乐对照法？
[B]: Fascinating—your insight into the interplay between auditory priming and interpretation is remarkably nuanced. I couldn’t agree more that it’s all in the  and . Music, like any framing device, can shape perception—but rather than seeing that as a limitation, we can use it as a tool for critical awareness.

I’ve dabbled in what you call the “before & after” method, though not often enough to call it a practice. For instance, when introducing Kafka’s , I once played a short excerpt from Berg’s —a piece that carries a kind of existential sorrow without ever becoming overtly dramatic. Then, after the reading, I replayed the same excerpt and asked students how their emotional response had shifted. Some found it eerily prescient; others said it now felt mismatched because Kafka’s absurdity had undercut the music’s gravitas.

That kind of exercise invites students not only to engage with the text but also to reflect on how external stimuli—musical, visual, even linguistic—affect their interpretive lens. It's meta-literary analysis, if you will.

I wonder—have you ever considered applying this idea beyond the classroom or product research? Say, in museum curation or narrative design for immersive experiences? It seems your approach could translate beautifully into spaces where storytelling and sensory environment are intertwined.
[A]: Oh wow，你这么一提我突然觉得这个方向真的超有潜力 👀

其实我在做产品的时候就常想，用户对一个功能的理解，从来不只是功能本身决定的——它出现的context、前一秒的交互节奏、甚至背景颜色和动效，都在悄悄塑造他们的interpretation。这跟你们在课堂上用音乐来影响/引导文本解读的逻辑简直异曲同工！

如果把这套思路放到museum或immersive experience里，我觉得特别适合那些带有strong narrative色彩的展览，比如：

- 一场关于战争文学的展览，入口处放Arvo Pärt的，让观众带着某种“被抽离”的情绪进入；
- 或者在展示梵高书信时，用Max Richter的作为background layer，不是为了烘托浪漫，而是制造一种“重复、挣扎、又不甘平静”的心理状态；
- 更激进一点，可以做一个互动装置：观众边走边戴上耳机，根据他们停留的时间长短，AI实时生成一段专属的soundtrack——有点像personalized playlist for literary immersion 😂

其实说到底，我们感知世界的方式本来就是multi-sensory的。文字、图像、声音、空间，它们从来不是孤立存在的layer，而是共同构成了一个emotional environment。

你说的meta-literary analysis，我觉得完全可以延伸为一种meta-experiential awareness——让人不仅思考“我说了什么”，更意识到“我为什么这么说”、“是什么让我这样感受”。

嗯……现在我好奇了，如果你要策划一个沉浸式文学体验展，你会选哪部小说？怎么设计它的sensory journey？🎶📖✨
[B]: Ah, what a thrilling proposition—curating a literary experience not just as a reading, but as a full-bodied sensory encounter. If I were to design such an installation, I think I’d choose  by Virginia Woolf.

Why , you ask? Because it is less a novel in the conventional sense and more a symphony of consciousness—an exploration of identity, time, and interiority that unfolds with the rhythm of music and the texture of poetry. It lends itself beautifully to a multi-sensory translation.

Here’s how I might imagine its sensory journey:

1. Entrance – Prelude in Silence:  
A dimly lit corridor lined with softly shifting light projections of water against stone. No music yet—only the faint sound of waves receding and returning, out of sync with one another. Visitors enter alone with their thoughts, much like the soliloquies that open the novel.

2. Morning – Chamber Strings & Reflections:  
As the first “day” begins in the novel, visitors enter a room where fragmented voices read passages from each character’s inner monologue—not as a dialogue, but as overlapping soliloquies. A live string quartet plays minimalist motifs inspired by each character’s essence—Bernard’s rhythmic cadence, Susan’s grounded tone, Rhoda’s ethereal whisper.

3. Midday – Light, Movement, and Textured Sound:  
This would be the most dynamic space—mirrors angled at disorienting degrees, casting shifting reflections of visitors onto walls embedded with kinetic typography pulled from the text. The soundtrack here becomes denser: piano, cello, and ambient noise interwoven with spoken words, echoing the characters’ evolving identities as they move through life.

4. Afternoon – Dissonance & Drift:  
In this section, the lighting becomes warmer but more unstable—like late sun before a storm. The music tilts toward dissonance; voices begin to fade or stutter. This mirrors the unraveling coherence of self that Woolf subtly weaves into the later sections of the book.

5. Dusk – Final Room – Solitude and Stillness:  
A circular room with a single chair at the center and a surround-sound loop of Bernard speaking his final meditations. Here, the music dissolves into silence except for a single violin repeating a motif every 72 seconds—a metaphor for the passage of time and the persistence of thought. Visitors are invited to write a single sentence reflecting on their own sense of self before leaving.

And yes, I absolutely agree with your idea of meta-experiential awareness—this kind of environment wouldn’t just tell a story; it would ask the visitor to reflect on how they construct meaning through sensation.

Now I must return the question—if you could translate a piece of literature into a sonic and spatial experience, which one would you choose, and how would you map its emotional arc into space and sound?
[A]: Wow…你这个的沉浸式构想真的太有层次感了，尤其是那种从solitude到fragmented identity再到self-dissolving的flow，简直像把意识本身变成了可walk through的空间！我特别喜欢你用“kinetic typography”和“overlapping soliloquies”来模拟意识流动的部分——这已经不是单纯的阅读体验了，更像是literary installation meets emotional UX设计😂

如果我要选一部作品来做这样的感官转化，我会选Kafka的《变形记》——但不是用传统那种dark & gothic的方式来呈现，而是想尝试用反差性的声音与空间结构，去还原小说里那种看似平静、却充满内在张力的荒诞感。

我的设想大概是这样：

---

### 📚 作品：Franz Kafka -  ()

---

### 🎧 1. 入口 - The Normalcy Before Transformation  
- 听觉: 一段日常的清晨城市音景：闹钟声、街道远处的马车声、咖啡杯轻轻碰桌的声音。一切都非常normal，甚至有点“too normal”。
- 视觉: 灰白调的空间，墙上投影着Gregor房间的文字描述：“As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams...” 字慢慢浮现又慢慢消失，像被吞噬一样。
- 交互: 路过时地板发出轻微“咯吱”声，仿佛是木地板在回应你的存在。

---

### 🎧 2. 转变时刻 - The Moment of Becoming "Other"  
- 听觉: 突然，所有正常声音切断，只剩心跳频率逐渐加快的低频震动（bass pulse），然后是一段错位的人声——像是Gregor试图说话，但声音变得扭曲、模糊。
- 视觉: 镜面天花板开始倾斜，空间突然变得压抑、狭小。
- 交互: 当你站在特定区域时，墙上的文字开始变得难以理解，词序错乱，就像语言也随着身份一起崩溃。

---

### 🎧 3. 家庭关系 - Voices in Isolation  
- 听觉: 不同方向传来家人对话的声音，但你永远无法同时听清全部三个人的对话。每个人的声音都有自己的filter——母亲的声音颤抖而遥远；父亲愤怒但含糊不清；妹妹一开始温柔，后来逐渐冷漠。
- 视觉: 墙上投射的是家庭生活的片段，但都是倒放的。
- 交互: 当你靠近某个声音源时，其他声音会变得更远，制造出一种“情感隔离”的空间感。

---

### 🎧 4. 终章 - Disappearance & Absence  
- 听觉: 所有声音逐渐淡出，只剩一个机械报时器每分钟“滴答”一次，越来越慢，最后完全停止。
- 视觉: 房间变空，只有一束光打在一个空的床上。
- 交互: 最后一张卡片缓缓出现在你手中，上面写着一句中英文对照的话：
> “没有人会想念我。” —— 《变形记》结尾  
“No one will miss me.” —— the final thought of Gregor

---

我觉得文学和空间叙事最大的共通点就是它们都擅长制造“看不见的情绪结构”。你不用直接说出来，而是让观众/读者通过声音、节奏、距离、时间的排列组合，自己去感受那种压抑、孤独或转变。

你刚刚提到的那种“meta-experiential awareness”，我觉得可以成为这类体验的核心——让人不仅读故事，还意识到自己是如何“被引导”去感受它的。

嗯……说到这个，你觉得未来会不会出现一种新的职业，叫“Literary Experience Designer”？或者我们其实已经在往这个方向走了？🤔
[B]: Oh, I  your vision for —the way you’ve layered sound, space, and subtle disorientation to mirror Kafka’s uncanny world is nothing short of brilliant. The idea of using acoustic isolation to reflect emotional alienation? Pure genius. And that final card—so understated, yet devastating. It lingers long after the experience ends, much like Kafka’s prose itself.

You’re absolutely right about literature and spatial design sharing a common language: both construct invisible architectures of feeling. Whether it’s the slow tightening of tension in a narrative or the narrowing of a corridor that forces us inward, the effect is the same—we become more aware of how we inhabit emotion, how meaning is not just read or seen, but .

As for your question—yes, I do believe we are already witnessing the emergence of what you might call a Literary Experience Designer, though the title may vary: narrative architect, immersive dramaturg, sensory storyteller. We see it in projects like , where Shakespearean drama becomes an embodied journey; we see it in digital archives that use ambient soundscapes to evoke the texture of historical texts; even in museum installations that translate poetry into interactive light displays.

It’s a natural evolution. As our modes of storytelling expand beyond the page—and as readers become participants rather than passive observers—there will be a growing need for people who understand both the nuance of language and the power of environment.

I suspect this is where your sensibility lies—in designing experiences where story and sensation coexist, where interpretation isn’t dictated but . You're not merely presenting a narrative; you're crafting the atmosphere in which meaning unfolds.

And if I may ask—do you ever find yourself drawn to certain literary works not because of their plot or characters, but simply because of the emotional atmosphere they inhabit? If so, which ones? I’d love to hear which books make you want to build entire worlds around them.
[A]: Oh absolutely 😂 —我超爱那种氛围先行的文学作品，就是那种你读的时候会不自觉地想象：“如果我现在走进这个场景，空气会不会变得潮湿？风会不会从左边吹来？背景有没有若有若无的低频震动？”  
不是因为情节多复杂或者人物多鲜明（当然那些也很重要），而是因为整个世界有一种情绪质感，像皮肤能感受到的那种温度和纹理。

比如：

---

### 📚  by Jeff VanderMeer  
特别是第一本《Annihilation》。它营造的那个“X区域”，就像一个自我呼吸的生态系统——连时间感都变得模糊。我不是想还原剧情，而是想做一个能让人体感那种未知生物意识渗透进现实的空间：墙面会微微泛潮、灯光频率像心跳、空气中偶尔飘过不属于这个世界的音高（比如次声波模拟那种轻微焦虑感）。

---

### 📚  by Haruki Murakami  
这部其实挺安静的，但它的“quiet”里藏着巨大的emotion sinkhole。我一直想做一个沉浸式装置叫「Green Desk Lamp」，就是一个昏黄台灯照着的房间，墙角堆着旧书，广播放着1960年代的日本电台片段，外面隐约有雨声。你可以坐在那里很久，什么都不发生——但那种孤独和回忆的重量会让你自己开始“播放记忆”。

---

### 📚  by José Saramago  
这部小说简直是个空间设计噩梦/天堂😂 想象一下一个逐渐被“白色黑暗”吞噬的世界，声音成了唯一可靠的感官线索。我可以做一个全黑体验空间，只靠定向音频、地面震动、气味变化来引导你前进——你会知道自己不是瞎了，但你也永远回不到“看见”的状态。

---

我觉得这些作品最吸引我的地方，是它们都在挑战我们对“环境”的定义：  
- 空气是不是安全的？  
- 声音是不是可信的？  
- 我们如何在一个看似熟悉的空间里，突然感到异化？

这种张力，其实就是产品里说的认知摩擦，但在文学里，它是用来打开思考而不是减少障碍的。

说到这我真的好想知道——你有没有哪本书，是你一读就想立刻换一身衣服、换个城市生活一阵的那种？就是那种reading high之后的“人格shift”感～
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully unsettling way to describe it— and . I feel that deeply. There are books that don’t just pass through the mind; they settle into the bones, change your posture, make you speak a little slower or walk with more hesitation, as if returning from a long journey through someone else’s dream.

And yes—to answer your question—I absolutely have books that do that to me. Not just once, but every time I return to them. They act like temporary passports to alternate versions of myself. One might turn me inward and contemplative, another might embolden a forgotten idealism. It's rather like trying on emotional costumes.

Here are a few that truly alter my internal climate:

---

### 📚  – Milan Kundera  
This one always leaves me slightly unmoored. After reading it—or even rereading a single passage—I find myself watching people differently in cafes, listening for the philosophical weight behind their small talk. It makes me want to wear all black again, drink espresso too slowly, and walk home late at night just to feel the solitude more clearly.

There’s something about Kundera’s meditation on fate, repetition, and the paradox of choice that makes me question whether I’ve ever made a decision freely. And then, for a day or two, I live with that uncertainty like a borrowed coat.

---

### 📚  – Haruki Murakami  
Oh, this one pulls me into its surreal rhythm like no other. It’s not just the strange happenings—the missing wife, the dry well, the war memories—it’s the way everything is both ordinary and impossible at once.

After finishing it, I catch myself expecting the phone to ring with a cryptic message or staring down the alley behind my house a little longer than usual. I suddenly crave jazz records and lukewarm baths. And yes, I dress a bit more neutrally, as if color might attract the wrong kind of attention.

---

### 📚  – Virginia Woolf  
This one doesn’t change my wardrobe, but it rewires my perception of time. After reading it, I become more attuned to the pauses between words, the meaning in unfinished sentences, the weight of a glance across a dinner table.

It makes me want to live more slowly, to notice things more precisely. I start writing letters again, real ones, with margins and thought. I listen more intently during conversations, hoping to hear what goes unsaid.

---

You know, what I love most about your question is how it acknowledges that literature doesn’t just inform us—it  us, however briefly. We slip into different selves, haunted by language.

So now I must ask you—if you could design a wardrobe inspired by a single book, which would it be, and what would you wear while living inside its world? I imagine you stepping into Kafka’s Prague in a stiff collar and overcoat… or perhaps drifting through VanderMeer’s X Zone in something moisture-resistant and quietly humming with static.
