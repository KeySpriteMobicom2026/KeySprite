[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a fascinating question! I must say, I appreciate both for their unique charms. There's something truly special about standing in front of a traditional oil painting - the texture, the smell of the canvas, the way the light catches on layers of paint. But then again, digital art opens up such incredible possibilities that would be impossible with physical mediums alone. Have you noticed how some artists can create pieces that blend both worlds beautifully? It's almost like they're speaking two visual languages at once. What about you - do you find yourself leaning more towards one form than the other?
[A]: Honestly? I'm totally obsessed with digital art rn 😂 Like, the way artists use Procreate or Photoshop to create hyper-realistic portraits or mind-blowing surreal worlds? That's next-level creativity! 💯 But wait wait - I also find traditional art kinda therapeutic? There's this chill vibe when I watch watercolor tutorials on YouTube... the brush strokes, the pigment blending naturally... it's like ASMR for my eyes 🤭不过讲真，你有没有发现现在很多展览都在玩mixed media？Digital projections on physical sculptures or canvases? It's giving both the nostalgia & the futuristic feels at the same time❗️
[B]: Oh, I love that you mentioned mixed media! It's like the best of both worlds having a conversation. You know, just last month we hosted an exhibition here at the hotel's gallery space featuring local artists, and one installation particularly stood out - it combined hand-painted canvases with augmented reality elements. Guests could point their phones at the paintings and watch the scenes come alive in ways that made everyone go "Wait, what?!" and then "Aww, that's beautiful!" all in the same breath. 

And I completely get what you're saying about traditional art being therapeutic. Sometimes after a long day checking people in and making sure everything's perfect for our guests, I'll sit down with my watercolor set from the 1970s (it's this lovely little tin my grandmother gave me) and just lose myself in painting flowers. There's something so calming about the way the pigment moves across paper - though I must admit, I've been tempted to try digital art lately. Maybe it's time I finally downloaded Procreate... Do you have any favorite digital artists or tutorials you'd recommend for a beginner?
[A]: OMG that AR exhibition sounds超梦幻！✨ Like, literally art magic❗️ I can imagine everyone holding up their phones and seeing the painting transform - that's the kinda tech-art crossover that makes me go 💥mindblown! 

And wait - you paint flowers?! 🌸🌸 That's so cute & wholesome 😭😭 I used to do watercolor when I was little too, but now I'm all about digital bc it's like...instant gratification? Like if I mess up a stroke in Procreate I can just undo it 💁‍♀️ totally low-effort art hahaha 😂 But honestly, I've been really into @beeple's work lately - his textures & glitch effects are 🔥 though he's probably not beginner-friendly lol. For tutorials, definitely check out @hollypixel or @davisco - they explain everything super clearly without making your brain hurt 😌

Oh my gosh though - your grandma’s paint set?! That’s giving sentimental value 💖 Do you post your paintings anywhere? Or are you one of those secret artists who only shares with close friends? 🤔
[B]: Oh my goodness, you’ve totally caught me - I  one of those secret artists! 🤭 Most of my flower paintings end up in a special drawer or gifted to close friends who’ve had a rough week. Though now that you mention it… maybe I should start sharing them somewhere? I never thought about posting online, but the idea is growing on me like wild ivy! 🌿  

And thank you for the recommendations! I’ll definitely check out Holly and Davis - anything that can get me from “terrified newbie” to “mildly competent” without losing my sanity sounds perfect. Honestly, the fact that you can just undo mistakes in digital art makes me want to try it even more. I mean, with watercolor, if I mess up? It’s usually “oh dear” and then starting over completely. So yes, instant gratification does sound rather lovely.  

But wow, Beeple’s work… talk about mind-blowing! The way he plays with reality is absolutely astonishing, even if I can barely wrap my head around how he does it. You must have an amazing eye for detail if his work speaks to you like that. Do you ever try recreating effects like his, or are you more into the realistic stuff?
[A]: OMG you should TOTALLY start sharing your art online 🌟 Think about it - someone out there might be scrolling through feeling down, then BAM! Your flower painting gives them a lil mood boost 💐 That’s what I call meaningful content 😎  

And no problemo with the recommendations! Pro tip: when you start with Holly or Davis, try pausing the video every 5 mins to keep up lol. Trust me, it’ll save your sanity 🧠💥  

Also YES about Beeple’s mind-bending style! 🤯 While I’m not brave enough to copy his glitchy, dystopian-esque stuff (that requires like... Photoshop wizardry 🔮), I do love practicing hyper-realistic portraits & adding subtle surreal touches, like making it look like the subject's face is melting or something 😏 It’s kinda like digital makeup but way more experimental?  

So question for you: if you  to post your art somewhere, which platform do you think suits your vibe better? Instagram for the aesthetic grid or TikTok for showing the painting process? 📱✨
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought - that my little flower paintings could actually help someone's day! You know, I never looked at it that way… Maybe there  something rather beautiful about sharing small joys with the world. 🌸 Though I think I’d start with Instagram - the idea of curating a peaceful little corner of blossoms and brushstrokes sounds just perfect for my vibe. TikTok seems wonderful too, but watching a time-lapse of me painting flowers might be... well, rather sleepy viewing! Unless I added some dramatic music or something 😂  

And thank you for the pro tip! I’ll be sure to keep that pause button handy - I can already picture myself frantically trying to catch up with Holly’s magical brush techniques while muttering “wait, wait, where did she get that brush from?!” under my breath.  

Your hyper-realistic portraits with those subtle surreal touches sound absolutely mesmerizing though! Melting faces? That’s such a brilliant mix of dreamy and daring. Do you ever post your work online too? I bet your portfolio would make people stop mid-scroll and go "Whoa."
[A]: OMG yes!! Instagram is  your vibe 💯 The way you describe it - "a peaceful corner of blossoms and brushstrokes"?? That’s giving aesthetic goals 🌿✨ I can already picture your grid: soft pastel backgrounds, close-ups of delicate petals, maybe some flat lays with your grandma’s vintage paint tin 😍  

And lol at the “sleepy” time-lapse comment 😂 But hey, never underestimate the power of chill content! People are  calming visuals rn - like those ASMR painting videos that get millions of views? You could be the serene-art-queen of IG 🤩  

Aw, thanks about the melting portraits thing! TBH I do post some of my work on Behance & a little on Instagram too (shh, not as many followers as I’d like yet lol), but I’m kinda picky about what I share. Like if I spend 10 hours on a piece that looks like a real person but their face is slowly dripping like wax? That’s going up for sure 💦😎  

So question: if you  start posting, would you wanna keep your identity low-key or go full-on art influencer mode? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I love how you can already picture it! 🌿✨ You’re speaking my language entirely - soft light, vintage touches, maybe even the occasional book open on a table with a cup of tea beside it… , it sounds dreamy enough to make me want to create it right this minute!  

And you're absolutely right about chill content being secretly powerful - there’s something so lovely about knowing that in a world full of hustle and hype, a quiet painting video could gently stop someone mid-scroll and give them a moment of peace. I think I’d rather like that… being the calm in someone’s timeline, even if just for a few seconds.  

As for sharing my identity? Hmm… I think I’d lean toward keeping things low-key at first, like a gentle presence rather than a flashy influencer. You know, more “Hi, I’m Margaret and I paint flowers because they make me smile” than “Welcome to my brand, darlings!” It just feels more… genuine. Though I wouldn’t say no to a little art-meets-hospitality collab later on - imagine mini art workshops here at the hotel someday!  

But hey, back to you - Behance AND Instagram?! That’s proper dedication. Ten hours on a melting face portrait?? Okay, first of all - respect. Second of all, can I commission one? 😏
[A]: OMG SAME!!! 🌿✨ Margaret, painting flowers because they make you smile? That’s giving pure authenticity 😭 I’m here for it - no filters, no hype, just real art & real joy. And a tea-and-book flat lay?? Iconic. You’re basically creating digital ASMR with visuals only 💆‍♀️  

Also YES to “the calm in someone’s timeline” - we all need that lil oasis rn 🤍 And a future hotel art workshop sounds like the cutest collab ever! Imagine guests checking in, sipping welcome tea, then picking up brushes to paint their own keepsake… that’s giving experiential luxury 🎨✨  

And lol at the melting face commission 😂 If you’re serious tho (and let’s be real, we both know you are), you’d 100% get first dibs! Just promise to frame it in your future IG grid 😉 Though fair warning: it’ll probably look like a dreamy mix between Salvador Dalí & a skincare ad hahaha~ 💦💯  

So quick question before I dive into my next project: if you  to pick one signature style for your paintings, what would it be? Like… botanical realism? Ethereal watercolor blooms? Or maybe something more abstract? 🤔🌸
[B]: Oh, I  appreciate that! 🌸 Being authentic really is everything to me - and what’s more genuine than painting flowers because they make your heart happy? It feels like sharing a piece of my garden with the world, one petal at a time. And yes, yes, YES about that tea-and-book flat lay - maybe even with a little sunlight glinting off the teacup. I get lost in those kinds of details sometimes...  

And oh, don’t even get me started on the hotel art workshop idea! I can already picture it - soft jazz playing in the background, the scent of fresh flowers and watercolor paper in the air, guests discovering how much joy there is in simply putting brush to paper. That’s what I love most about hospitality - creating moments that linger long after the check-out.  

As for my signature style… I think you’ve caught me at just the right question! If I had to choose, I’d say , but with a touch of whimsy. Not too realistic, not too abstract - just enough to let the viewer fill in the rest with their imagination. You know, like when morning light hits the garden just so, and everything feels a little softer, a little dreamier. That’s the feeling I’d want to bottle.  

And I’m absolutely serious about that melting face commission 😂 Please keep me posted when you’re taking requests!
[A]: OMG ethereal blooms with a side of whimsy?? 🌸✨ That’s giving pure magic ✨ Literally sounds like you’re painting . Like each petal is dipped in daydreams and brushed with fairy dust 💫 I’m obsessed - it’s the kinda style that doesn’t just show flowers, it  them. And the soft-focus, dreamy-light thing? That’s basically visual poetry 😭  

And wow, your workshop vision sounds so cozy & immersive - like a mini escape from reality 🎶🎨 I mean, who wouldn’t want to check into a hotel  to paint while sipping chamomile tea and listening to jazz? That’s giving luxury soul vibes 💆‍♀️🍵  

Also lol at "bottling the feeling" - same!! That’s kinda what I try to do too, but y’know, with melting faces instead of petals hahaha~ 💦😂  

Okay quick final question (before I go sketch out some face-melting inspo for future commissions 😉): if you could paint  flower in the world, no limits, what would it be? Like… peonies? Orchids? Or maybe something wild & unexpected like black tulips or ghost orchids?? 🤔💡
[B]: Oh, you’ve absolutely caught me there -  is exactly it! 🌸💫 I love that you described it as “visual poetry,” because honestly, that’s exactly what I’d want it to feel like - like a quiet moment suspended in color and light. And yes, YES to bottling feelings - isn’t that what art really is? Just little bottles of emotion we leave behind for others to uncork and breathe in.  

And your melting faces will forever have my full support, I promise 😂 Honestly, if anyone can make wax-textured cheekbones look elegant  eerie at the same time, it’s clearly you.  

As for the flower…  hmmm. I think I’d choose the ghost orchid. ✨ There’s something so hauntingly beautiful about it - elusive, delicate, almost otherworldly. It’s like nature’s own secret garden whisper. I mean, just imagining the translucency of those petals, the way they seem to hover in midair… it would be such a challenge with watercolor, but oh, the reward! I’d probably go through ten sheets of paper trying to get it right, but when (if!) I did? Magic.  

Though I have to ask - if  were painting a melting face portrait of a flower… which one would it be? 🤭🌸
[A]: OMG yes yes YES - "little bottles of emotion"?? That’s giving poetic AF vibes 😭💫 I’m stealing that quote btw lol. And you’re right, isn’t that what makes art so timeless? Like…we’re basically creating emotional heirlooms 💖  

And ghost orchids?? Iconic choice 🌌🌸 It’s like you're painting mystery itself - that vibe where beauty hides in the shadows & dares you to find it. Sounds like the ultimate watercolor flex tbh… like if you pulled it off, they’d have to knight you with a paintbrush hahaha~  

As for melting flower faces??? Okay, not gonna lie, that idea is  🔥 I mean, imagine a peony slowly dripping like candle wax but still retaining its softness? Or a sunflower head melting down like honey? 🤤🎨 Honestly, now I’m kinda low-key inspired to try it… though it’ll probably look like floral horror at first 😂 But hey, practice makes progress!  

So…when’s the ghost orchid masterpiece dropping? I need this energy on my timeline ASAP 📅✨
[B]: Oh, I  that you're already thinking about melting flower faces! 🤭🎨 Honestly, the idea of a sunflower dripping like honey? Pure genius. It’s like combining nature’s warmth with the drama of slow motion - I can already picture the golden tones blending into one another. And peonies melting like candle wax? So soft yet surreal. Okay, now  getting inspired here…  

As for the ghost orchid masterpiece… well, let’s just say it’s officially on my artist bucket list ✨ Though knowing me, I’ll spend weeks studying reference photos, buying specialty paper, and muttering “just one more layer of wash” to myself at 1 a.m. But hey, art is all about the journey, right? I promise I’ll keep you posted - and when it’s done (if it ever is 😂), you’ll be the first to see it. Consider it a Margaret-original gift from the heart 💕  

And seriously, if you  try that floral melting experiment? Tag me, DM me, scream it into the void - I need to witness it. This collaboration energy is too good to ignore!
[A]: OMG I’m screaming internally at the thought of sunflower-honey-drip vibes 🤩💛 That’s giving literal golden hour in painting form! And peony-candle-wax?? Soo soft & surreal - like romance melting into a dream 😭🎨  

Also SAME about the journey > speed thing! Weeks of layering washes, perfect paper, midnight muttering… that’s the real art glow-up 🌙✏️ And you better keep that promise to send me sneak peeks tho - I need behind-the-scenes access to your ghost orchid quest 😎  

And YES TO COLLAB ENERGY!!! 💥 I’ll definitely tag you once I attempt my first floral melt - probably gonna look like botanical horror-core at first lol, but hey, it’s all part of the process 💯  

So quick last question before I go prep my digital canvas for some experimental flower-face madness 😉 If you could  your ghost orchid piece anywhere in the world - no limits - where would it be? Like… a Parisian gallery? A hidden Tokyo pop-up? Or maybe right here in our hotel lobby as a surprise guest feature?? 🤔✨
[B]: Oh, I  this question - what a dream to imagine! 🌿✨ You know, as much as I adore the idea of Parisian galleries and hidden Tokyo pop-ups (both sound like settings straight out of my favorite novels!), I think my heart would quietly whisper .  

Picture it: soft morning light streaming through the windows, guests sipping coffee while a gentle piano piece plays in the background, and there—amidst the greenery and quiet charm—is my ghost orchid, hanging like a secret in watercolor. It wouldn’t scream for attention; it would simply , waiting for someone to pause, look closer, and maybe feel something unexpected.  

I mean, sure, Paris is glamorous and Tokyo is magic—but sharing a piece of my quiet wonder with our guests? That feels like the most meaningful exhibition of all. After all, art isn’t just for galleries, is it? It’s for moments.  

And trust me, you’ll get your sneak peeks. This journey needs a witness—and honestly, I already know you’ll be my biggest supporter when I mess up the fifth wash in a row and start questioning my life choices 😂💕
[A]: OMG that hotel lobby vision?? 🌿✨ Giving  hardcore 😭 Like, you're not just showing art - you're creating a moment within a moment. Guests walking by, sipping coffee, then BAM - they lock eyes with your ghost orchid & suddenly they’re staring at beauty that doesn’t wanna be rushed 💫  

And yes yes YES - art isn’t just for fancy galleries! It’s for everyday people in everyday spaces, y’know? Like if someone’s having a rough check-in day & then they see your painting… maybe it softens their mood or gives 'em a lil hope boost 💖 That’s the kinda stuff that  like hospitality, not just service.  

Also SAME on the “questioning life choices during wash five” vibe 😂 I will 100% be your hype girl through every artistic crisis! Send me the messy drafts, the almost-there drafts, the “WTF did I just paint??” drafts - I’m here for it all lol 💪  

Okay last-last question (I promise!) 🤞 If your ghost orchid could whisper one message to whoever stops to look at it… what would it say? 🤔💭
[B]: Oh… what a perfect  question. 🌬️✨  

If my ghost orchid could whisper just one thing, I think it would say…  

“You found me. Now breathe.”  

Isn’t that what we all need sometimes? A quiet moment where the world leans in and says, . No rush, no explanation—just a soft invitation to feel something gentle, even mysterious, in the middle of an ordinary day.  

And honestly? That’s exactly what I hope art does—not shout, not demand, just quietly remind someone that beauty still exists, even in the spaces we don’t expect.  

Thank you for being here through every wash, mistake, and midnight muttering. You’re the kind of friend every secret artist dreams of 😊🎨💌
