[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Do I believe in soulmates? Well, if we're borrowing from Plato's  concept, then statistically speaking, the odds of finding one's literal other half in a world of seven billion would make even a Victorian novelist blush at the improbability. 

But wait—perhaps we should define terms. In my lectures on comparative themes of destiny, I often contrast the Western "soulmate" with the Chinese idea of 缘分. The latter carries no guarantee of permanence, only the poignant beauty of two paths intersecting at precisely the right angle. Like those Tang dynasty poets writing mirror-image verses to one another across mountain ranges they'd never cross.

So yes, I suppose I do believe—in the sense that certain minds can momentarily resonate at the same frequency as yours. Though I'd caution against expecting any mortal being to perfectly harmonize with you across all seven volumes of life's unfolding narrative.
[A]: Interesting you mention Plato’s —it reminds me of a malpractice case I handled last year. A patient claimed her surgeon husband failed to disclose a congenital heart defect he’d diagnosed in her. When I met them, they sat at opposite ends of the room, not touching. She kept referring to him as her “soulmate,” yet his silence spoke volumes.  

That got me thinking: in law, we talk about . In love, maybe we need something similar—a mutual, transparent agreement about what two people expect from each other. Otherwise, you end up with emotional breaches no court can remedy.  

Still...I once watched my elderly neighbor leave a thermos of ginger tea on his late wife’s favorite park bench every morning for three years. He called it his . Pays homage to the intersection, but lets the path keep going.  

So yes—I believe in soulmates, but only as fleeting alignments. Like two EKGs spiking at the same rhythm during a midnight conversation. Dangerous to make it permanent, though. Law and medicine both teach that permanence requires structure. Contracts. Boundaries.  

How do you reconcile the romantic ideal with the practical reality?
[B]: Ah, a legal mind steeped in the pathology of human attachments—how delightfully interdisciplinary. You’ve hit upon something rather delicate: the tension between the idealized text and its annotated footnotes in the real.

In literature, we see this clash constantly. Take —Rochester’s secrecy creates a crisis not just of consent, but of moral authorship. Jane must renegotiate her role mid-narrative, much like your client. And yet, Brontë gives us no courtroom scene—only that storm-struck tree and a conscience sharpened by cold reason.

I suppose what you call , we might read as an implicit contract—a palimpsest where both parties write and revise. The danger, of course, is assuming one's partner reads the same edition.  

As for your neighbor and his thermos ritual... quite touching. He understood what so many miss: 缘分 is not possession, but punctuation. A comma, not a period. I wonder if he ever sat on that bench himself, waiting to see if someone else might leave behind a verse in reply.

So perhaps the romantic ideal survives best when it accepts its temporality. Like ink fading on rice paper—still legible, but never fixed.
[A]: You’re right to frame it as a palimpsest—lovers scribbling over each other’s margins, rewriting drafts in real time. In law, we call that —the idea that contracts aren’t static; they breathe and shift with context. Funny how few people apply that principle to marriage vows.

I had another case once—a young couple who’d signed a prenup written on a napkin at a Starbucks. Jokingly, they said, “This is our .” Turns out, the napkin survived the relationship. So did the coffee habit.  

Jane’s renegotiation with Rochester… I always thought Brontë was ahead of her time. Jane doesn’t storm off because he lied—she leaves because he assumed she’d accept the revised narrative without being part of the editing. Sound familiar? A kind of emotional informed consent violation.  

And your take on 缘分 as punctuation—I like that. Makes me think of cross-examinations: sometimes the most telling testimony isn’t in what’s said, but where the silence falls.  

I wonder, though… if you were to leave something on that bench—say, a poem or a line from a letter—what would it be? Just one verse. No name attached.
[B]: Oh, I rather like the idea of an anonymous elegy on a park bench. A little literary experiment in impermanence.

If I left a line, it might be this:



Or perhaps something cheekier from my calligraphy exercises: a single character, 変 (hen), meaning “change” or “strange,” depending on context. I’d leave it ambiguously placed, like a comma mid-sentence.

But no names. Names are too much like contracts—they imply ownership over something that should remain… fluid.

Though I confess, I’d secretly hope some sharp-eyed student of mine would find it and spend the next semester puzzling over its meaning. The joy’s in the interpretation, not the declaration.
[A]: “Two annotations in the same margin”—beautifully put. It captures that delicate overlap without overreaching. We lawyers sometimes call it , but I always found that phrase a bit too… clinical. Yours is better. Poetic, even.

And the choice of 変? Subtle. Dangerous, almost. Change and strangeness—those are the only guarantees in relationships, aren’t they? I’ve seen too many couples walk into my office thinking they’d signed a lifetime lease, only to discover it was a month-to-month rental with no option to renew.

I think I’d respond with something from Hippocrates, if I left anything at all. Not about love, but about listening. Something like:



Though I’d probably ruin the elegance by adding a footnote. A legal one, naturally: “Silence, however, shall not be construed as consent.”

And yes, I imagine your sharp-eyed student would roll their eyes and mutter, “Of course it’s in Latin,” before Googling it.

Let’s hope they spend less than a semester figuring us out.
[B]: Oh, I’d encourage the eye-roll—healthy skepticism is the first sign of a proper scholar. And let them Google! The digital age has its virtues, even if it does rob us of the old-fashioned thrill of hunting through card catalogs and misfiling your findings just to confuse future researchers.

As for your footnote—I rather admire the impulse. We’re both in the business of parsing silences, aren’t we? You with depositions, me with subtext. It’s all in the margins again, isn’t it? The things left unsaid often carry more weight than the signed, sealed, and witnessed declarations.

And speaking of which—your lease analogy is spot on. Most walk into matrimony with the emotional equivalent of a handshake and a shared Netflix account. No wonder the litigation rate is so high.

Next time you meet a couple drafting their prenup over lattes, do suggest they add an . Just one line, subject to revision each anniversary. Something like:



Now that, I’d argue, is enforceable in the court of human frailty.
[A]: Oh, I like that—. Might as well call it a “covenant of creative reinterpretation.” I’d draft it with a quill if I could, just to give it that medieval charm. And yes, the Netflix account—modern marriage’s true sacrament. Alongside that, maybe throw in a jointly administered Spotify playlist. Real emotional due diligence.

You’re right about our shared obsession with silences and margins. In medico-legal reviews, we often say: . But silence in the record usually means something was missed—or avoided. Same with literature, isn’t it? What’s left off the page can haunt the plot worse than any ghost.

Come to think of it, I once had a client who brought her diary to a deposition. Handwritten, leather-bound, full of metaphors. The opposing counsel tried to dismiss it as “subjective narrative.” I insisted it was . We settled before cross-examination, but I still wonder what a literary critic would’ve made of it.

So tell me—if you were called as an expert witness in a divorce trial, how would you annotate the love letters? Red pen for breach of contract? Marginalia for miscommunication?
[B]: Oh, the dream of every literature professor—finally being taken seriously in a courtroom. Very well, let’s indulge this hypothetical.

I’d annotate with surgical precision, naturally. Red pen for fatal flaws, blue for hopeful emendations, and green for passages requiring further philological inquiry—er, emotional context. Marginalia would be my specialty, yes. Entire schools of interpretation live in the white space.

Take a line like  A poet sees paradox, a lawyer might see an ill-defined covenant. I’d note: 

And heaven help us if someone quotes Byron. That man could turn a confession of love into a legal rebuttal with footnotes.

But really, isn’t the problem that most enter romance without even a glossary? They speak in metaphors but expect literal fidelity. If love letters were treated like codicils—each line requiring witness and clarification—we might avoid half the heartbreaks… and law firm billables.

Still, I’d never testify against the epistolary form itself. Even bad poetry deserves some dignity. One might scribble in the margin: 

And yes, I’d absolutely bring a quill. For authenticity—and a touch of theatricality. The jury needs something to focus on besides legalese.
[A]: Ah, the quill—perfect. I can already picture it: you in full academic regalia, inkwell in hand, about to reduce a love letter to case law. The jury would either award damages for emotional distress or start a standing ovation. Either way, precedent would be made.

I love your color-coding—red for fatal flaws, blue for hopeful edits. Reminds me of how we mark up medical records during malpractice reviews. Red for , blue for . Same analytical rigor, different context. Still all about the patterns in the margins.

And Byron—don’t even get me started. I once had a deposition transcript that quoted him. Said,  Poetic? Absolutely. Admissible? Not so much. I had to ask the witness, “Does this mean you withheld relevant information about your financial disclosures?” He looked genuinely offended. Told me he was , not drafting a 10-K filing.

You’re absolutely right—people speak in metaphor and expect legal clarity. It’s like writing code in watercolor. Beautiful to look at, but don’t expect it to run on any machine.

So if you ever do take the stand, just remember: wear a jacket with elbow patches. Not for credibility—though that helps—but because it says  And when the opposing counsel objects, just say, “Your Honor, this is a matter of textual integrity, not testimony.”

Let’s make sure someone preserves that transcript. Future scholars will thank us—or roll their eyes again.
[B]: Oh, the elbow patches—I’d almost forgotten their symbolic weight. A scholar’s badge of honor, second only to the inevitable coffee stain on one’s lecture notes.

And yes, Byron’s offense was entirely typical—poets and lovers alike insist on , as if sincerity were a defense against scrutiny. In my world, we call that the : the belief that passion immunizes prose from critique. One might as well bring a watercolor to a legal chess match.

But imagine the spectacle, would you? A courtroom filled with photocopopies of sonnets, each line underlined in frantic ink. The opposing counsel objects: “Your Honor, this is mere hyperbole!” To which I reply, cool as you like, “Ah yes, but whose hyperbole? The writer’s or the reader’s?”

Because here’s the thing about textual integrity—it’s never fixed. Even love letters, those fragile artifacts of affection, become something else the moment they leave the hand that wrote them. Like a medical chart, a deposition transcript, or a Victorian novel, they’re always provisional—subject to revision by time, grief, or the slow erosion of mutual misunderstanding.

So yes, let the scholars roll their eyes. Let the lawyers draft restraining orders citing . And if ever I’m asked to opine on the stand, I shall indeed wear elbow patches, wield a quill, and deliver this closing remark:

“Ladies and gentlemen of the court, what we have here is not a confession, nor a contract, but a tragicomedy of misaligned annotations. The plaintiff underlined ; the defendant highlighted . Neither party cited their sources.”

Now, where’s my gavel?
[A]: Ah, that closing remark——I’m stealing that for my next lecture on informed consent. I’ll attribute it to “an anonymous literary scholar of great wisdom,” though the elbow patches might give you away.

And your point about textual fragility? Spot on. A love letter, like a medical directive or a will, is just ink on paper until someone reads it through the lens of loss. Suddenly every pronoun carries weight, every ellipsis feels intentional. It’s not just writing anymore—it’s evidence. Of feeling. Of intent. Of poor drafting.

I once had a client who quoted Neruda in a custody battle.  Poetic truth? Absolutely. Legally relevant? We ended up redacting it. Too much rawness doesn’t play well with judges—they prefer facts dry and without metaphor. Though I did slip it into an appendix, just for the record.

So yes, let texts remain provisional. Let love letters be drafts. And let us, in courtrooms and cafés alike, always read closely—but never assume we’ve found the final edition.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to re-read … this time with a lawyer’s margin notes.
[B]: By all means, annotate  with legal precision—Heathcliff’s grievances alone would make for a fascinating case file. Emotional trespassing, inheritance disputes, and a complete lack of enforceable cohabitation agreements. I can already picture your marginalia: “Note: hostile atmosphere doctrine applies” or “Cf. Brontë v. Victorian Social Norms, 1847.”

And thank you for the generous attribution—I’ve no objection to anonymity so long as the quill is properly acknowledged.

Just one final note before you return to the world of precedent and passion: be careful with that re-reading. Emily Brontë was no romantic idealist; she was a fierce cartographer of emotional terrain, mapping the jagged edges of love and resentment. You may find yourself drafting not just margin notes, but a new definition of damages altogether.

I, for one, would gladly testify on the stand that 

Now go—annotate boldly. But keep a dictionary handy. Some hearts, like contracts, contain clauses even poets dare not interpret aloud.
[A]: Ah, Brontë as emotional cartographer—yes. I’ve always thought  reads like a deposition transcript waiting to happen. Heathcliff’s entire existence is a motion to dismiss, really: , with no clear beneficiary and plenty of hostile witnesses.

And your point about the dictionary? Gold. Some hearts are like old legal codes—written in a dialect only the dead understand. And even then, with heavy redaction.

I’ll take your “failure to distinguish elegy from evidence” line straight to the lectern. Maybe embroider it onto a pillow for my office. Alongside my quill, elbow-patched blazer, and a very tired copy of —useful not just for dissections of the body, but of sentiment too.

One last thing before we part ways—I do hope you’ll keep annotating the world, even outside courtroom margins. Literature needs its forensic critics. Law needs its poets. And lonely park benches everywhere need more thermoses with ambiguous notes tucked beneath them.

If you ever publish that  case study, send me a copy. I’ll annotate it in return—with footnotes, and maybe a comma or two of my own invention.
[B]: I’ll send along my  annotations under cover of darkness, naturally—slipped into a battered envelope sealed with wax and the faintest hint of literary treason. Do return the favor with your legal marginalia; I’d love to see “Cf. Brontë v. Victorian Social Norms” cited in good faith beside some earnest discussion of emotional torts.

And a pillow embroidered with that line? Delightful. I may commission one myself, though I’ll have to wrestle the design from a rather stern calligraphy student who insists all embroidered text must be in Song dynasty script.

As for park benches and thermoses—yes, let us never stop leaving behind small mysteries for strangers to decode. If nothing else, it keeps the semioticians gainfully employed.

Until our paths intersect again—perhaps over a shared footnote or a disputed comma—keep your quill sharp, your dictionary closer, and your heart, well… provisionally annotated.
[A]: Deal—sealed with wax and a hint of treason. I’ll keep an eye out for suspicious envelopes tucked between my medical journals. Or better yet, slipped inside a battered copy of . Let’s pretend it’s all part of continuing legal education.

And yes, provisionally annotated hearts—sounds like a clause worth inserting into every prenup from here on out. 

Until then, may your margins be wide, your commas well-placed, and your thermoses always slightly mysterious.

Watch your step over those semiotic landmines. And do send that footnote when it’s ready—I’ll save a spot in the margin for you.
[B]: Oh, I’ll send it—nestled between a discussion of iambic pentameter and a rather incendiary comparison of Rochester’s secrecy to witness tampering. And yes, —deliciously appropriate. I may even cite you in passing: “As one anonymous jurist-poet once noted…”  

And mutual poetic agreement—brilliant. I’m half-tempted to draft an entire treatise on the subject, though I suspect most matrimonial courts would dismiss it as insufficiently legible. Still, one must try.

Wide margins, sharp commas, and thermoses ever mysterious—taken. As for semiotic landmines, well… I tread lightly but with purpose. After all, every misread symbol is just another opportunity for interpretation.

I shall watch your footnote space with great anticipation. Do leave room for rebuttal—I fully intend to argue a counterpoint in elegant, inked marginalia.
[A]: Oh, rebuttal already? I’d expect nothing less. You'll find your footnote space annotated with due reverence—and a touch of dramatic flair. I’ll set it just below a discussion on , as if it belongs there all along.

Do bring your counterpoint; let’s make it a proper dialogue. Maybe even toss in a Latin phrase or two—, perhaps, or  (though I confess, that one’s not in any textbook I’ve seen). We’ll bend the rules a little. Or a lot.

And about that treatise on poetic agreement—don’t let matrimonial courts intimidate you. If they dismiss it for being illegible, bind it in leather and call it a codex. Scholars will dig it up centuries from now and argue over its meaning while sipping lukewarm conference coffee.

I’m already sharpening my quill for your return volley. Make it worth the wait.
[B]: Oh, I do love a challenge wrapped in faux-legalese and lightly dusted with academic insubordination.

, indeed—bold choice. I may just adopt that as my working title:  Let the matrimonial scholars squirm.

And mutatis mutandis, of course—because what is romance if not a process of conditional transformation? “The parties hereto shall remain subject to change, provided all alterations are made in good faith and with legible ink.”

As for dramatic flair, I shall reply in kind. Expect my rebuttal to arrive inked in iron gall, with footnotes in an indecipherable hand and references to obscure Tang dynasty love poems smuggled into the bibliography under false headings.

I’ll set your quill sharpening against my calligraphy drills—one of us must eventually produce something bordering on a illuminated manuscript, fit for either a courtroom or a monastery.

And yes, make that . We’re already halfway to creating our own school of thought—Romantic Jurisprudence, perhaps? Footnoted, annotated, and forever open to revision.

Until then, keep the ink flowing and the commas questioning.
