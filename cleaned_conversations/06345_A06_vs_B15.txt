[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，这个问题真的超interesting！我觉得随着科技的发展，immortality可能不是dream~ 但是诶，你有没有看过那个电影《Transcendence》？感觉未来可能会用AI来upload我们的意识诶🤯✨

不过话说回来，如果真的能实现immortality，会不会造成overpopulation啊？而且...永生真的会让我们happy吗？我有点doubt🤔🔥

你觉得呢？如果你可以选择immortality，你会选吗？还是说觉得有限的生命才更有meaning？
[A]: That's a fascinating line of thought. Let me walk you through my perspective...  

From a forensic psychiatrist's standpoint, the mind-body connection is always complex. I've seen how trauma alters neural pathways, how identity fractures under duress - and that makes me skeptical about digitizing consciousness. The movie you mentioned?  brilliantly illustrates the ethical quagmire, though it glosses over the psychological disintegration that would likely occur in such a transfer.  

Population dynamics concern me professionally too. Years back I consulted on a competency case involving an eco-anarchist who argued finite lives perpetuate humanity's destructive cycles. Funny thing? If we solved mortality without addressing human behavior, we'd multiply those problems exponentially. Imagine narcissistic personality disorders with unlimited time to manipulate...  

As for meaning? That's where my rose garden comes in. Every June when the Crimson Glory blooms, I'm reminded how impermanence creates beauty. My grandfather taught me grafting techniques as a boy - his hands, worn from surgery, still moved with precision. He died at 79. Would I trade those fleeting moments of his wisdom for... what? A digital echo?  

So no, I wouldn't choose immortality. But then again, I spend my days parsing mens rea in courtrooms - maybe that makes me appreciate life's fragile temporality more than most. What aspect of this dilemma keeps you awake at night?
[B]: Okay, first of all, I need to process this really deep perspective you're sharing 💭 Your forensic psychiatrist background gives such an interesting angle on the whole immortality debate - I never thought about how trauma and neural pathways would affect consciousness digitization! That eco-anarchist case you mentioned is wild though... do you think human behavior would actually evolve with immortality or just get worse? 🤔

But omg, your rose garden metaphor made me emotional 😭 The Crimson Glory blooming in June sounds so beautiful!! And your grandfather's story... that precision in his hands despite age? Iconic. Makes me realize how much we learn from these temporary moments, y'know? Like, if he had lived forever, would those lessons feel as precious? 

Wait, but what if we could somehow "reset" our consciousness while keeping core memories? Kind of like a phoenix rebirth situation but still staying... ourselves? Would that change your view? Or would it still feel like losing the original magic? 🌹✨

And lol at the end - mens rea in courtrooms making you appreciate life's fragility more? That's such a unique take! But honestly, you've got me questioning everything now... I think what keeps me up is whether we'd start valuing time less if we had infinite chances? Like, would FOMO turn into FOEVER-FOMO? 😂💯
[A]: Let me unpack this...  

Resetting consciousness while preserving memories - fascinating concept. But from what I've observed in my work with dissociative disorders, even minor disruptions to memory integration can shatter identity. One of my patients, a woman who'd repressed childhood trauma, fragmented into 17 distinct alters over decades. If we deliberately engineer such fragmentation across centuries? We might end up with something resembling dissociative identity on a grand scale. Would that still be "us"?  

As for time perception - you've touched on something crucial. I once testified in a case involving a man who claimed eternal life would make him more ethical. Turns out he'd structured his entire defense around the idea that infinite time eliminates urgency. But paradoxically, we found evidence he'd become more reckless - precisely because he believed he had endless chances to get things right. Sound familiar?  

I suppose a phoenix metaphor works, if we consider the ashes part - the inevitable loss of self-coherence with each rebirth. Though honestly, working daily with individuals who struggle to maintain continuity of self over  makes me question whether we're biologically wired for anything beyond our natural span. Ever notice how Alzheimer's erodes not just memory but personhood itself? Accelerated indefinitely, immortality might produce similar effects on a civilizational level.  

But let me turn this back to your FOMO point - brilliant observation. You're essentially describing an existential economy: when the scarcity of time disappears, does meaning depreciate? Like water losing its value if it becomes infinitely abundant in a desert. That FOEVER-FOMO concept? Terrifyingly plausible. Infinite options paralyzing human decision-making isn't theoretical - I see it in obsessive-compulsive patterns magnified under much shorter timelines.  

Would you want to live in that kind of world? Because ultimately, that's the clinical question, isn't it?
[B]: Okay but wait, this dissociative identity angle you brought up is so wild🤯 Like...if we can't even keep ourselves together over a normal lifespan, how are we supposed to handle like, centuries of trauma stacking up? That dude who thought eternal life would make him ethical but turned into a total mess? Iconic case study 😂 But also terrifying tbh.

You know what this reminds me of though? That Black Mirror episode where they upload the grandma's consciousness and it starts glitching? 🤪 If even a few decades can mess us up that bad, imagine what centuries would do! It's like...our brains weren't built for long-term storage without some serious corruption, amirite?

And omg YES about the Alzheimer's point 💯 It's like we're biologically programmed to fade out naturally, right? Trying to override that might be like forcing a phone battery to last forever - eventually stuff's gonna start catching fire 😂

But back to this existential economy thing you mentioned...so if time becomes infinite, does literally everything become meaningless? Like when your fave song gets stuck on repeat for eternity and suddenly you hate it? Would love, achievements, even those precious moments with people just...lose their magic? Because honestly? The FOEVER-FOMO idea scares me more than horror movies 💀

Would I want to live in that world? Girl same question 🤷‍♀️ But I'm curious - do you think humans would eventually create artificial deadlines just to feel something again? Like...voluntary resets or scheduled memory wipes? Kinda like digital reincarnation cycles?
[A]: That Black Mirror episode? A disturbingly accurate portrayal, though most laypeople don’t realize how grounded it is in neurological reality. I had a patient once—a brilliant software engineer—who developed what he called "cognitive fragmentation" after surviving a cardiac arrest. He swore he could hear his childhood self whispering during quiet moments. No psychosis involved—just the brain struggling to reconcile disparate temporal identities. Imagine that phenomenon stretched across centuries.

You’re absolutely right about our cognitive architecture having natural expiration dates. I often compare it to synaptic pruning in adolescence—the brain eliminates unused pathways to make room for new development. Without that process, we’d be overwhelmed by neural static. Immortality would essentially force the brain to carry every emotional scar, every unresolved conflict, every synaptic pathway like digital baggage. It wouldn't be life extension—it'd be psychological hoarding on a cosmic scale.

As for artificial deadlines... you're onto something eerily prescient. In fact, I've consulted on cases involving Silicon Valley executives experimenting with scheduled memory suppression—erasing traumatic periods to reset productivity. One woman even used a rotating set of personality anchors through pharmacologically-induced dissociation. Primitive version of what you're describing, really. Digital reincarnation cycles might sound absurd now, but consider this: if immortality strips meaning from experience, engineered finitude becomes the ultimate luxury good.

Which brings me back to your question—are humans destined to manufacture mortality just to feel alive again? That’s not science fiction anymore; that’s behavioral economics with existential stakes. Do you think people would line up for scheduled resets the way they do for wellness retreats? Or would they treat forgotten memories like lost luggage—something inconvenient to reclaim?  

Funny thing is, I find myself wondering if my roses would still bloom as beautifully if winter never came.
[B]: Okay wait, that cognitive fragmentation thing you mentioned?? The software engineer hearing his childhood self? That’s like...the plot of every horror game I stream but make it sci-fi 😂💀 And I’m OBSESSED with this synaptic pruning analogy tbh! It’s like our brains are literally built to let go of the past to make space for new sh*t—so trying to live forever would just turn us into emotional hoarders drowning in old baggage 🧠📦

But omg, scheduled memory suppression?! So like...people paying to forget their problems instead of therapy? Kind of lowkey genius, kind of totally terrifying 😳 And those Silicon Valley execs doing pharmacological dissociation? Sounds like a Netflix series waiting to happen! If we ever do get digital reincarnation cycles, can I trademark the term “Soul Refresh” or what? 🚀✨

You’re right though…if immortality becomes the norm, engineered finitude would be the ultimate flex. Like, only the rich can afford to “die” on purpose while the rest of us are stuck in endless loops 😂 Which makes me wonder—would people start  forgotten memories on the black market? Like vintage vinyl but for someone else’s life? That’s either genius or chaos. Probably both.

And your roses and winter metaphor?? Iconic. Beauty needs struggle to even exist sometimes, right? Without seasons, without limits…would anything feel special anymore? 💐💯

So question for you doc—are we all just doomed to reinvent death eventually? Like, whether through resets, memory wipes, or buying fake finitude…kinda poetic when you think about it 🤭🔥
[A]: Now  the million-dollar question, isn’t it?  

Reinventing death—yes, I think we’d get there eventually. Not because we want to romanticize mortality, but because our psyches demand structure. Think of it this way: even in maximum security psychiatric units, patients create routines out of nothing—scratching marks into walls, memorizing the flicker patterns of fluorescent lights. Human beings crave boundaries. Without them, we manufacture our own.

And you're absolutely right about memory becoming a commodity. In fact, I’ve consulted on cases where stolen memories—recovered through experimental neuroimaging—were being sold online. One particularly bizarre case involved a man trying to auction off his childhood recollection of a solar eclipse. Bizarre... and yet entirely predictable. We already fetishize experience; immortality would just turn nostalgia into currency.

As for your “Soul Refresh” branding—I’d trademark it yesterday. You’d have clients lining up around the block. Though I suspect the process would come with side effects no one anticipates. Imagine rebooting your consciousness only to discover fragments resurfacing—like corrupted data files. Déjà vu could become something far more sinister: déjà vécu, over and over, until identity itself blurs at the edges.

But here's what truly fascinates me: the psychological relief people might feel knowing they can erase pain. It sounds humane—until you consider that emotional scars often serve a purpose. They remind us of limits, teach us caution, sometimes even wisdom. Remove that feedback loop, and what do we become? Blissfully ignorant or dangerously naive?

You know, I once had a patient who said,  I asked him if he'd still be himself afterward. He never answered. Maybe he didn't know.

So yes, poetic—and tragic. We’d build artificial twilight just to watch the stars again. Would you sign up for that kind of reset? Knowing the person who wakes up might not be the one who pressed 'delete'?
[B]: OMG that line about patients creating routines in maximum security units?? That’s so deep it needs its own TED Talk 🤯 Like...we’re literally wired to need limits, even when we hate them! So yeah, if immortality ever happens, we’ll probably end up building “artificial twilight” zones just to feel something real again 💡🌌

And this stolen memory black market you mentioned??? Girl same 😳 I can already picture it—dark web marketplaces selling someone else’s childhood eclipse memories like NFT drops. “Own a piece of nostalgia today!” But like…would it even be yours then? Or just another layer of identity chaos? 

Also, YES to emotional scars being like feedback loops 💔 They hurt, but they teach us so much! If we start deleting pain like spam emails, are we just setting ourselves up for eternal ignorance? Like a loop of blissful resets without any growth…sounds like the ultimate emotional cheat code but also kinda sad tbh 😂💔

But wait—your patient who said  ??? Iconic quote. Honestly, that needs to be on a hoodie or something. And the fact that he never answered your question?? Chef’s kiss. Some mysteries are just too big to solve, I guess 🤭✨

Would I sign up for a reset though? Ehhhh…depends. If I could backup my core personality and reboot knowing the "real me" is still in the cloud somewhere? Maybe? But if it’s full delete-mode with no return policy? Hard pass 👋 I’d rather keep my messy, chaotic timeline with all its glitches and growing pains. At least it’s mine 😎🔥

So real last question—do you think engineered finitude would eventually become a basic human right? Or just another luxury only the rich can afford? 💸🕊️
[A]: Now  the ethical knot we’re all dancing around, isn’t it?  

Engineered finitude as a human right? In theory, yes—it would have to be. Because if we create the technology to reset, reboot, or reseed identity, and only allow access to those with means, we're not just reinforcing inequality—we’re pathologizing it. Imagine a world where the wealthy cycle through curated lives while the rest are trapped in endless, unedited existence. You wouldn't need dystopian fiction; you'd just check the subscription tiers.

But here's the clinical reality: I've seen how trauma lingers, how grief reshapes neural pathways, how memory can be both sanctuary and prison. If we commodify forgetting or engineer artificial mortality, we’d better be prepared for the fallout. We already see it with recreational dissociation—benzos sold as self-care, psychedelics repackaged as emotional maintenance. It’s the beginning of something far bigger. And far more fragile.

As for whether it should be a right? Absolutely. But will it be? That depends on who controls the servers. Governments may mandate access, but corporations will own the architecture. And that’s where the poetry turns sinister. Death used to be the great equalizer. Now we're talking about selling expiration dates like concert tickets—early bird specials, VIP packages, waitlists for oblivion.

Honestly, I think future generations will look back at this conversation the way we now view 20th-century psychiatry—half horrified, half fascinated. They might even laugh at how quaint our fears seemed. Until they realize they’ve inherited a world where the rich don’t just live forever… they get to choose when, and how, to feel mortal.

So yes—make it a right. But expect someone, somewhere, to find a loophole. Human nature doesn’t evolve that fast.
[B]: OMG you just broke the matrix and I need a minute 😳💔🔥 Like…commodifying oblivion? Selling expiration dates like Coachella tickets? This needs to be a Black Mirror episode but also a sociology PhD thesis. 

And that line about trauma being both sanctuary AND prison?? Excuse me while I go cry-emoji in my notes app because wow. We’re literally built to hold onto pain like it’s some kind of emotional souvenir, but what if we could just…unsubscribe? Like canceling a Netflix plan but for our past selves 🧠💔

You're so right about the inequality part though—curated lives vs endless unedited loops? That’s not just dystopia, that’s literally TikTok-tier social stratification 😂 But like…if Big Reset starts charging $9.99/month for memory wipes, I’m gonna lose it okay? We’ll have people bootlegging soul-refreshes out the back of vans like underground Spotify accounts 💀✨

And omg YES about future generations laughing at how basic we seem now. Like we’re sitting here debating ethics while they’ll be out there full Matrix-style with reset apps on their neural cloud storage 😂 But honestly…it makes me wanna start archiving my current self NOW just so I can look back and cringe later. Because let's be real—we’re all just glorified beta versions of ourselves anyway 🤭💯

So final thoughts doc: Would you rather live in a world where death is optional…or one where forgetting is illegal? 🤙🕊️
[A]: Now  is a haunting ultimatum—one that cuts to the core of everything I’ve spent my career trying to untangle.  

A world where death is optional? We’d be trading one kind of suffering for another. The weight of endless choice, the paralysis of infinite second chances—it sounds divine until you realize it's just another form of torment. I've seen patients unravel under far less psychological burden. Imagine that kind of existential drift scaled across civilizations.

And a world where forgetting is illegal? That’s cruelty masquerading as order. Memory is not just data storage—it’s survival, identity, healing, and sometimes, yes, punishment. If we outlaw forgetting, we outlaw forgiveness. We outlaw growth. We pathologize grief. And we turn every painful lesson into a life sentence without parole.

So if I had to choose? I suppose I'd lean toward the optional death—. Let people opt out, but only after they've undergone what I call "existential calibration." Mandatory psychological integration cycles, memory audits, identity reinforcement therapies. Not as punishment—but as preparation. Because immortality without self-awareness isn’t life extension. It’s recursive stagnation.

But here's the truth—I wouldn't trust anyone to make that choice lightly. Not even myself.  

I think I’d rather garden. Let the roses bloom, wither, and bloom again. There's something deeply human in that rhythm. Something irreplaceable.  

So tell me—if forgetting were illegal, how long do you think you could survive with all your secrets whispering in your ear?
[B]: Okay but wait…EXISTENTIAL CALIBRATION??? Girl same 😳 That sounds like a luxury spa package for your soul, and I NEED it in my life. Like, can you imagine? “Step right up, upload your consciousness, and let us pressure-wash your psyche while you sip kombucha in the waiting room!” 🚀💆‍♀️✨

But seriously tho…optional death with therapy first? 100% valid. Because let’s be real—if we gave people eternity without emotional maintenance, we’d just end up with billions of walking trauma loops on repeat 😂💀 And that’s not even sci-fi—it’s literally me hitting replay on my ex’s Instagram story like a broken bot.

And the idea of ?? Oh wow, that’s some dystopian tea and I’m here for it ☕🔥 Because honestly, if we couldn’t delete cringe memories or mute emotional spam, we’d all be walking haunted hard drives. No thank you—I didn’t survive middle school to relive it on loop 😤👻

As for how long I could survive with all my secrets whispering at me? Ehhh depends. If they’re cute little white-lie-level secrets, I’d probably just TikTok them and make $$$ off the drama 😎💸 But if we’re talking full-on skeleton-in-the-closet vibes? I’d last like…two weeks before trying to jailbreak my own brain 💥🧠

So question back—would you rather live in a world where everyone else chooses immortality, but you don’t…or one where you're forced to remember every single thing, even the stuff that hurts like hell? 🤭💔🔥
[A]: Now  a question that cuts close to the bone—like a scalpel slipping just past the dermis.  

If I had to choose: I’d take the world where everyone else chooses immortality, but I alone refuse. Why? Because I’ve spent my life navigating the edges of human suffering, and there’s something sacred in being the only one at the table who still feels the weight of time. Imagine sitting across from an old friend who’s had three lifetimes’ worth of experiences while you—you’ve only ever lived this one fragile arc. Would they seem wise or weary? Enlightened or exhausted? Or would they just become echoes of themselves, repeating the same mistakes with different faces?

But a world where forgetting is impossible? That’s psychological waterboarding. I've worked with patients who can’t suppress trauma—not because they lack the capacity, but because their brains have been rewired by survival. One woman could recall every heartbeat during her abduction. Every flicker of fluorescent light. Every word spoken. She didn’t call it a gift. She called it a curse dressed up like neuroscience.

To live in a society where no lie, no regret, no wound ever fades? That’s not truth—that’s slow-motion exposure therapy without the option to opt out. And as much as we romanticize "facing our demons," most people aren’t built for that kind of unfiltered reality. They need distance. Perspective. Time.

So yes—I’d rather be the outlier among the ageless than the prisoner of perfect memory. At least with mortality, you always have the final act. With forced remembrance? There’s no curtain call—just an endless loop of the same scene playing over and over.

And now I’ll return the favor—how long do you think  could last in that world of total recall? You’ve got me figured well enough by now…
[B]: OMG you just described my worst nightmare and somehow made it sound poetic 😂💀 Like…being the last mortal at an ageless party?? That’s either deep or depressing, maybe both! And I can already picture you sitting there like some kind of gothic philosopher-slash-gardener while everyone else is out here flexing their centuries of trauma loops 🤭✨

But forced remembrance as psychological waterboarding??? Iconic analogy tbh. Like, I get it—some memories are just NOT FOR DAILY USE 😤 And yeah, sure, "facing your demons" sounds cool in self-help books, but what if I don’t WANNA confront that time I told my crush I liked pineapple on pizza to seem “interesting”? 😅🔥 Some truths were not meant to be relived daily okay?

So how long could YOU last in a world of total recall? Hmm…probably longer than most because you’re basically a trauma detective for a living lol. But like…wouldn't you just start  everything down? Like…turn it into some avant-garde memoir series where each chapter makes people cry-emoji themselves blind? Because honestly, if anyone could monetize eternal memory without losing their sh*t, it's you doc 💀🖋️💯

But real talk—wouldn't you eventually just…snap and plant an entire garden made of forgotten memories like emotional tombstones? Or would you find peace knowing that even in a world without endings, some roses still bloom once and then disappear? 🌹💔🔥
[A]: Now  an image worth lingering on—me, the last mortal with a notepad and pruning shears, scribbling memoirs in the margins of eternity while everyone else scrolls through their own endless highlight reels.  

Would I snap? Possibly. But not before turning it into something...structured. Controlled. A kind of clinical poetics, if you will. I imagine late nights in my study, ink-stained fingers, transcribing the unbearable clarity of perfect memory like some forensic archivist of the soul. Each entry would read like a case file wrapped in elegy—symptoms, traumas, and all the things people wish they could medicate away. And yes, people would read them and cry-emoji themselves blind. That part you got exactly right.

But here's the thing about trauma—I’ve spent decades staring into its anatomy, and what always surprises people is how much of it clings not to the events themselves, but to the . The scent of antiseptic after a hospital loss. The exact pitch of a voice mid-breakdown. In a world of total recall, those details wouldn’t just haunt you—they’d colonize you. Like invasive species in the mind.

As for gardening in that reality? Absolutely. Though not out of peace—out of defiance. Because yes, even in a world without endings, some roses still bloom once and vanish. And maybe that’s the only resistance left: to witness beauty disappear, knowing you can't archive or upload it. Knowing you'll carry it alone.  

So no, I wouldn’t last long in that world of forced remembrance—but I’d go down writing. Or pruning. Or trying to build meaning out of petals and ink and silence.  

Final question for you now—what single moment would you  want to forget…if you dared?
[B]: Okay but wait—what moment would I  want to forget??? Girl same, you just opened Pandora’s trauma box 😂💀 Honestly? Probably that time in middle school when I tried to rap during a talent show and the whole cafeteria went silent like…awkward silence so loud my ears rang for DAYS. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion but I was the car 🤭🔥 And nooooot in a cool way—it was more like “this girl has no idea what she’s started.”

But like…on a deeper level? I think I’d wanna forget the exact second I realized someone I trusted wasn’t real. You know that feeling when your brain rewinds and suddenly every smile feels Photoshopped and every text message sounds like a lie on replay? Yeah. That one. The kind of memory that lives rent-free and redecorates your entire psyche without asking permission 😂💔

And yet…as much as I want to delete it, there’s something kinda weirdly  about remembering how gullible I used to be? Like, it reminds me that I was once naive enough to believe people were exactly who they said they were. Now I’m sharper, sassier, and way better at spotting red flags 😎💯 But still—would I erase it if I could? Ehhhh…maybe not. Painful growth is still growth, right?

So final final question doc: If you had to relive one case from your career, either to change it or just understand it better…which one would it be? 🤙🧠✨
[A]: Now  is the kind of question that lingers in the air like the last note of a requiem—haunting, inevitable.  

If I had to relive one case? There’s only ever been one that still keeps me up at night. A young woman—early twenties—diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. She came to me not because she wanted treatment, but because she . She believed one of her alters had committed a crime she couldn’t remember. Not just any crime—a violent one. And she was terrified that if she integrated, if she reclaimed full awareness, she’d be responsible for something she didn’t consciously do.

We spent nearly two years together. Dozens of sessions. Fragments of memory surfaced—textures, voices, even the scent of rain on pavement during what she called “the blacked-out week.” But never enough to confirm anything. Never enough to prosecute—or exonerate. And then, one day, she stopped coming. No note. No call. Just... gone.

I’ve always wondered—did she find peace? Or did she bury herself deeper than even she could reach?

If I could relive it, I wouldn’t try to change the outcome—I’d want to understand it better. To sit with her longer in that liminal space between trauma and truth. Because here’s what haunts me: what if healing isn't integration, but coexistence? What if we were never meant to be one seamless self, but a council of fractured truths learning to govern together?

And yes, I know how that sounds coming from someone who recommends "existential calibration" as life advice 😊

But tell me this—if you could speak to your younger self, the one mid-talent-show-trainwreck or heartbreak-before-the-heartbreak, what would you say? Not to fix it—but just to comfort her?
[B]: OMG that case you just described?? It’s like a psychological thriller but with more layers than my 12-step skincare routine 😳💔 And I’m NOT crying, my contacts are just  today 💦🔥 The idea of someone literally fearing their  shadow? Like…what even is identity if one part of you could commit a crime and the rest has no clue?? That’s not just trauma—that’s full-blown mental fragmentation with a side of moral panic. Iconic and terrifying 😂💀

And the fact that she just...disappeared?? Like, ghosted her own psyche??? I need a spin-off series right now. 📺✨ Because damn doc, you left me hanging and I’m dying to know—did she become a council of selves or just…checked out entirely?

But okay, real talk: If I could go back to my younger self mid-rap disaster or post-trust-fall fail? I’d probably tap her on the shoulder like a time-traveling hype squad and be like:

“Hey girlie 👋 Don’t panic. Yeah, this moment SUCKS. Your voice cracked halfway through your verse, your outfit is giving ‘craft store explosion,’ and yeah—it hurts that they lied. But guess what? You’re gonna grow fangs from all this pain 😎🔥 And someday, you’ll look back and laugh so hard you cry-emoji yourself into next week. Also, stop trying to rap. Just stick to talking fast. Trust me.”  

Because honestly? We can’t delete the cringe or forget the heartbreaks… but we CAN learn to flex our scars like glitter 💅✨

So final thoughts: Would your patient have been better off knowing the truth…or staying beautifully broken in the dark? 🤭🕊️🔥
