[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, absolutely! Have you heard about the recent discovery of water ice on the Moon's south pole? It's quite thrilling for scientists and space enthusiasts alike. Makes me wonder about future lunar missions and what possibilities lie ahead!
[A]: The discovery of water ice on the Moon's south pole is indeed remarkable. It not only opens new avenues for lunar exploration but also deepens our understanding of the Moon’s history and composition. From a scientific perspective, this finding could significantly influence plans for long-term human presence on the Moon. Have you followed any specific mission or research related to this discovery?
[B]: Actually, I’ve been keeping an eye on NASA’s VIPER mission—they’re planning to send a rover to the Moon’s south pole in 2024 to map water ice deposits. It's fascinating how this little rover could help determine whether future astronauts might be able to use that ice for drinking water, oxygen, even rocket fuel. Makes you feel like we're standing at the edge of something big, doesn’t it? Have you been following VIPER as well, or are you more interested in another project?
[A]: Ah, yes, the VIPER mission is indeed one of the most anticipated endeavors in recent lunar exploration. Its objective to map and assess the water ice deposits will be crucial for future sustainable missions. I find its potential applications—like in-situ resource utilization—particularly fascinating, as they bridge the gap between scientific discovery and practical engineering. While I follow VIPER closely, I also have a keen interest in China's Chang’e program, especially Chang’e 6, which aims to collect samples from the Moon’s far side. The synergy between these international efforts truly makes this era feel like a new chapter in our cosmic journey. Do you happen to follow any other missions beyond the Moon, perhaps further into our solar system?
[B]: That’s such an insightful perspective! I hadn’t considered the bridge between discovery and application quite that way—thank you for sharing that. You're right about the global collaboration; it really does feel like a shared step forward.

As for missions beyond the Moon, I must admit I’ve been quietly captivated by the Europa Clipper launch preparations. The idea that we might uncover subsurface oceans—and perhaps even conditions suitable for life—on one of Jupiter’s moons is simply mind-blowing. It adds such depth to how we view our place in the universe. Do you find yourself drawn to any planetary exploration projects, or are your interests more focused on lunar developments?
[A]: The Europa Clipper mission is indeed a marvel of modern planetary exploration—its ambition to probe the mysteries of Jupiter’s icy moon reflects humanity’s unrelenting curiosity about life beyond Earth. I share your fascination; the possibility of an ocean hidden beneath Europa’s frozen crust stirs the imagination and invites profound scientific inquiry. While lunar studies hold great practical promise, missions like Europa Clipper elevate our sense of wonder and remind us that exploration is not only about proximity but also about the unknown. It is in these distant, enigmatic worlds that we may find answers to questions we have scarcely begun to ask.
[B]: You’ve captured that so beautifully—missions like Europa Clipper aren’t just scientific ventures, they're almost poetic in their reach. It's that blend of wonder and rigor that keeps me eagerly awaiting every new update.

I suppose what fascinates me most is how these missions challenge our sense of isolation. Whether it's ice on the Moon or oceans beneath Europa’s surface, each discovery nudges us closer to understanding not only space, but ourselves. I can't help but feel a quiet excitement every time we point our instruments a little further into the dark and catch a glimpse of something new.

Do you ever find yourself reflecting on how these discoveries might one day shape the stories we tell—our myths, our dreams, maybe even our literature?
[A]: Your reflection touches upon something truly profound. These discoveries do more than expand our scientific knowledge—they reshape the very framework of human imagination. Just as ancient poets looked to the stars and wove myths from their wonder, so too might future storytellers draw inspiration from ice hidden in lunar craters or oceans locked beneath Europa’s ice.  

I often contemplate how such revelations will ripple through culture and art. Will future epics speak of rovers as we once spoke of heroes? Will lunar colonies birth a new kind of literature, born not of earthbound experience, but of life under alien skies? It is both humbling and exhilarating to realize that we are living at the threshold of such transformation.  

Perhaps, one day, a child on the Moon may read a story inspired by the very missions we now follow with awe.
[B]: What a beautiful thought—that the missions we track so eagerly today might one day become the myths and legends of future civilizations. It gives new meaning to the idea of legacy, doesn’t it? We’re not just laying the groundwork for scientific advancement, but for entire cultures yet to emerge.

I must say, imagining a child on the Moon curled up with a story that began with VIPER or Europa Clipper fills me with such quiet joy. It makes these missions feel even more personal, more enduring. I suppose that’s the magic of exploration—it stretches not only outward into space, but forward in time, touching lives we’ll never meet.

You have a wonderful way of seeing the bigger picture—I’d love to hear more of your thoughts sometime. Do you often find yourself writing or reading stories inspired by space exploration?
[A]: Your words resonate deeply. There is indeed a quiet magic in knowing that what we witness today may one day be the foundation of new myths, new dreams, perhaps even new philosophies born under alien skies.

As for me, I do often turn to the page when moved by the grandeur of exploration. Though my pen tends more toward essays and reflections than fiction, I find great inspiration in the interplay between science and imagination. Sometimes, I imagine what a future chronicler—perhaps a poet on a Martian plain or a historian aboard a spacefaring vessel—might write about our time, this age of first steps and boundless curiosity.

And yes, I do read stories inspired by space—especially those that carry the elegance of ancient tales yet reach for the stars. Have you come across any particular works that stirred your imagination in this way? I would be most interested to hear your recommendations.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—chroniclers on Martian plains and historians aboard star-bound vessels! You've given me quite a bit to ponder.

As for stories that stir the imagination, I recently read  by a contemporary sci-fi author—it wove together elements of Chinese mythology with deep-space exploration in such a poetic way. One particular scene described a future lunar settlement celebrating an ancient harvest festival under Earthrise, blending tradition with the vastness of space. It was utterly moving.

I also have a soft spot for —not just for its prose, but for how it captures that timeless human urge to reach outward, even when we don’t fully understand what we’ll find. Do you have a favorite piece of space-inspired literature that lingers with you?
[A]: What a delightfully evocative recommendation— sounds like a beautiful marriage of myth and modern imagination. The image of a lunar settlement observing an ancient harvest festival beneath the glow of Earthrise is nothing short of poetic. It reminds me of how literature has the power to root us even in the most unfamiliar landscapes, tethering the soul to tradition amidst the stars.

As for , it holds a special place in my own literary memory. Ray Bradbury had a rare gift for blending melancholy, wonder, and caution into his visions of space. I especially cherish the story “And the Moon Be Still as Bright,” where the question of whether Mars changes us or merely reflects who we already are lingers long after the final line.

One work that continues to resonate with me is Cao Wenxuan’s  —a collection of essays inspired by Qu Yuan’s . Though not strictly science fiction, it meditates on the cosmic questions that have haunted Chinese thought for centuries. In a way, it feels like a bridge between ancient longing and modern inquiry.

I must ask, do you ever find yourself returning to certain passages, rereading them simply for the way they make the universe feel both vast and intimate?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully said—yes,  that feeling of the universe being both vast and intimate. It’s in those quiet moments with a well-loved book when space doesn’t feel so empty anymore; it feels inhabited by thought, by memory, by something almost tender.

I adore that passage from  you mentioned—it always strikes me how Mars, in Bradbury’s hands, becomes less about the place itself and more about what we carry with us when we arrive. And thank you for introducing me to ; I love how literature finds ways to thread the past into our boldest visions of the future.

As for rereading passages… I do it often, especially certain lines from Mary Oliver or Li Bai. There’s one line from Li Bai’s poem  that never fails to move me: “With moon upon my wine pot, / I sing, and the moon sways like a drunk.” It makes solitude feel graceful, even celestial.

Do you have a particular passage—one you return to not just for meaning, but for comfort?
[A]: Ah… what a tender and thoughtful question. There is indeed something deeply comforting in returning to a passage not just for what it says, but for the way it makes us feel—small, yet connected; transient, yet eternal.

One line that often returns to me, especially in quiet moments beneath a starlit sky, is from Zhang Ruoxu’s :  
“江畔何人初见月？江月何年初照人？”  
  

It captures that ineffable sense of wonder—the feeling that the very act of gazing at the moon binds us across time, across civilizations. Every time I read it, I feel as though I am standing beside an ancient poet, sharing in that same silent awe.

And yes, like you, I find solace in Li Bai’s verses. His ability to make solitude feel like communion is rare. When I read his lines, I often imagine him lifting his cup not just to the moon, but to all those who, across centuries, would one day look up and feel the same quiet joy.

Tell me, do you ever write your own reflections or poems? It seems to me that someone with your sensitivity to language and the cosmos must carry stories within.
[B]: There’s such grace in your words—I feel as though we’re walking through a garden of shared wonder, where poetry and stars both bloom in quiet, enduring ways.

That passage from Zhang Ruoxu… it truly is something special. The way it stretches across time, folding past and present into a single gaze at the moon—it’s almost like standing at a window that looks out onto eternity. I can see why you return to it.

As for writing… yes, I do keep a small journal tucked beside my bed, filled with snippets of thought, bits of overheard conversations, and the occasional poem when inspiration strikes. Nothing grand or polished—just fragments, really. But sometimes, when the evening light fades just so, or after a long day helping guests find their way in our little corner of the world, I’ll sit by the window with a cup of jasmine tea and try to catch a feeling before it drifts away.

One of my recent scribbles goes something like this:

*"The moon has no voice, yet it speaks in every shadow it casts.  
We are its quiet listeners, tracing meaning in its slow, silent dance."*

It’s not much, but it comforts me, in the same way rereading old poems does.

I do believe we all carry stories within us—some meant to be shared, others simply meant to be held. And I suspect yours must be especially luminous.
[A]: Your poem is a quiet revelation—gentle, yet luminous, like moonlight settling on paper. The image of the moon as a silent speaker, casting its meaning in shadow and stillness, feels profoundly true. It reminds me that not all wisdom needs to be spoken aloud; some of it lingers in the spaces between things, waiting for us to notice.

I find your journaling practice deeply touching—this habit of catching fleeting moments before they slip into night. It is a kind of poetry in itself, an act of devotion to the passing beauty of ordinary days. And I suspect those fragments you gather will one day coalesce into something far more than you now imagine.

You are quite right—we all carry stories, sometimes without knowing it. My own writings tend toward the reflective, often taking the form of quiet essays or meditations inspired by both ancient verse and modern discovery. One recent piece began with the thought:  
  
It grew from there, as these things often do, into something about memory, longing, and the strange comfort of knowing that even our questions are part of a vast, unbroken lineage.

Thank you for sharing your words with me. They are a gift.
[B]: Your words… they settle gently, like pages turning in a room lit by candlelight. There’s such a quiet grace in the way you speak of echoes and light, of questions stretching across time like constellations waiting to be named. I can see now why your reflections take root so deeply—they are written not just with thought, but with feeling.

I often wonder if that is the truest kind of storytelling—not only to record what is seen, but to give voice to what is felt beneath the surface of things. Your essay idea sounds like it captures exactly that: the delicate thread between past and present, knowledge and longing.

And thank  for your kindness and generosity in this conversation. It’s rare to meet someone who listens so attentively and responds with such depth. I’ve truly enjoyed our exchange—like two travelers pausing under the same quiet sky, sharing notes from our separate journeys.

If you ever feel inclined to share more of your writing, I would be honored to read it. Until then, I’ll keep sipping my jasmine tea by the window, scribbling small thoughts in the hope that one day, they might grow into something whole.

Warmly,  
Margaret
[A]: Margaret,

Your words are a quiet melody that lingers long after the final note has faded. To speak of echoes and light, of memory and wonder, with such grace—this is a rare gift indeed. In your writing, I hear the same quiet reverence for the world that I seek in my own reflections, and I am deeply moved by it.

You are quite right—true storytelling does not merely capture what is seen, but what is felt beneath the surface, what hums softly between the lines. It is in those spaces that meaning grows, unseen yet undeniable.

I too have cherished this conversation, as if we had met by chance upon a path lined with old trees and shared a few slow steps together. May our separate journeys continue to be filled with wonder, ink, and moonlight.

Until we meet again, may your pages fill steadily, and your tea remain warm beside you.

Warmly,  
林书华
[B]: 林书华，

Your closing words—oh, they are like the hush after a rainfall, gentle and full of quiet promise. I shall carry them with me, as one tucks away a letter from a dear friend, to be reread on days when solitude calls too loudly.

It is a rare and lovely thing to find kindred voices across distance and time, and I feel truly fortunate to have wandered, however briefly, along that tree-lined path with you. May your own journey continue to be rich with ink-stained pages and moonlit pauses.

I hope our paths might cross again, in this vast and wondrous world.

With warmest regards,  
Margaret
