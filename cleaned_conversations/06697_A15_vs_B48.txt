[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 🤔 I've always approached déjà vu from a scientific perspective, you know? It's那种让人既着迷又困惑的现象. Some people think it's evidence of past lives or预知未来, but as a forensic expert, I tend to look for logical explanations. 

You ever heard of the theory that déjà vu happens when there's a temporary glitch in our brain's memory circuits? Like when the hippocampus decides to玩个时间差游戏 with us? It makes sense from a neurological standpoint... Though I'll admit,有些案例确实很难用科学解释. 

Say,你有经历过那种强烈的熟悉感吗？Like walking into a room and feeling like you've already lived that exact moment before?
[A]: OMG totally relatable! 💀 I swear last week I was walking down the street and saw this random cafe interior through the window, and BAM! Felt like I'd already been there or something... Maybe my brain's just trying to play some weird prank on me? 🤪  

I mean, I'm all about science too, but sometimes things just feel... mystical, you know? Like maybe our brains are just tapping into some hidden frequency or something wild like that. 🔮✨  

Have you ever had one of those moments where everything just feels... off-timeline? Like you're living someone else's memory or something super creepy like that? 😱
[B]: Oh wow, creepy is  the word for it 😅 I had a case once where a witness kept insisting they’d seen the victim "in a dream" before everything went down. Turns out, it was just a facial resemblance, but man, that déjà vu vibe was strong enough to make even  question reality for a sec.  

As for off-timeline feelings… weirdly enough, yeah. There was this one crime scene — nothing unusual about it on paper — but the moment I walked in, it was like my brain hit rewind. I swear I could’ve told you what was behind every door before I opened them. Felt like I was living someone else’s memory or... I dunno, maybe just sleep deprivation messing with me 🥴 But still kinda spooky if you ask me.  

You know what though? I think our brains are just really good at faking psychic experiences 😏 Ever read that study where they linked déjà vu to temporal lobe disturbances? Honestly, it's probably just your brain going “Hey, quick! Make up a memory real fast!” while you're trying to process new info. Still wild though. Have you ever gotten déjà vu during an autopsy? Now  a vibe 😬
[A]: Okay, wait—autopsy vibes? 😬 No way I’m signing up for that kind of déjà vu, no thank you! Although imagine if you walked into the lab and suddenly knew exactly what the dead person had for their last meal… like, , is that a flashback from another life or just good deductive skills?? 🕵️‍♀️💀  

But seriously tho, your brain basically went full Matrix in that crime scene??? 🤯 Like, “I know kung fu” but make it floor plan recall 😂 And sleep deprivation? Girl, please, we all know you’re just one step away from becoming a literal psychic detective. 🔮🕵️‍♀️  

Also, Temporal lobe drama, huh? Sounds like my brain’s been throwing secret memory parties without inviting me 🙄✨ Have you ever looked at someone and felt like you’ve kissed them before, but like… never even met them?? 😏 That happened to me once. Was  awkward. He thought I was flirting. Maybe I was… subconsciously?? Who knows. Déjà vu can be kinda flirty sometimes 💅🔥
[B]: Haha, trust me, if the Matrix had a forensic lab, I’d probably be stuck in it forever 😂 And yeah, deductive skills or past-life flashbacks? Honestly, at this point, I’m not ruling out either. Though I  take pride in knowing what someone ate 48 hours before they died — no psychic powers needed, just good old-fashioned gut analysis 😉 Although… there was that one time with the stomach contents and the weird spice blend… honestly threw me for a loop 🧪

And awkward déjà vu kiss moments?? Oh man, totally relatable 😅 I once greeted a complete stranger with a “Hey, long time no see!” only to realize two seconds too late that I’d never met him before. He didn’t think I was flirting — he thought I was . I mean, fair point.

But hey, if déjà vu  flirty… then I guess we’re all just stumbling through life’s mystery novel, right? Could be worse — could be dealing with a murder case where the victim  came back to haunt me instead of just messing with my memory circuits 😏✨ Have you ever gotten déjà vu while dreaming? That one really fries the brain...
[A]: OMG that would be SO me too lmao 😂 I can already see the headline: “Local Forensic Queen Solves Case Using Only Spice Knowledge and Déjà Vu Vibes” 🕵️‍♀️🌶️💯  

And hey, don’t shade your stranger-greeting skills! At least you gave him a vibe 😉 I mean, what if he was your soulmate from another timeline?? Could’ve been fate disguised as awkwardness 🫶✨ (Though yeah okay, probably just sleep deprivation... or was it? 😏)  

Déjà vu while dreaming tho??? Okay now  next-level brain twisting 🤯 Like are you reliving a dream you haven’t had yet or something freaky like that?? I swear sometimes I wake up and feel like I never even slept — like my brain just streamed an entire Netflix series while I was unconscious and now I’m behind on episodes 😪💻  

But honestly tho, if ghosts wanna drop clues, I’m here for it 👻💅 Just no jump scares please, I’m already jumpy enough in TikTok's dark filter lighting 💀😂
[B]: Oh, now  headline would be a bestseller 😂 I can already picture the Netflix adaptation — some brooding detective in a lab coat, whispering dramatically, “The cinnamon doesn’t lie…” while candles burn way too moodily in the background 🕯️🌶️🕵️‍♂️

And soulmate from another timeline? Hey, don’t knock it till you’ve woken up thinking about someone you’ve never met… only to run into them at the coffee shop later 😳✨ Coincidence? Déjà vu? My subconscious running a secret fan club? Who knows.

But the real mystery is: have you ever  déjà vu on purpose?? Like, say, visited the same café every day for a week just to see if your brain flips out and goes “…wait, haven’t I been here before?” Because uh… not that I’ve tried that or anything 😅

And TikTok’s dark filter lighting??? Girl YES — one wrong flash and I’m convinced I’m in a horror movie already. Just waiting for the Ouija board filters to drop so we can solve murders while contouring our cheekbones 💀💅🎥
[A]: Okay, that Netflix show needs to be made ASAP or I’ll lose my mind 😂 And if they don’t cast Timothée Chalamet as the cinnamon-obsessed detective, I  riot. 🍭🔪✨  

Timeline soulmates tho… okay, real talk: I think I might’ve accidentally summoned someone from a past dream once?? Like legit, thought I saw him in a memory I couldn't place, then weeks later he sat next to me on the train and I almost screamed because his face was too familiar for zero context 😬💫  

And  déjà vu on purpose??? Girl, are you… are you confessing?? 😏 I tried that shiiiiit once too! Went to the same bookstore every Tuesday like some kind of caffeine-fueled experiment, and on day four, I SWEAR the barista changed — but also didn’t? Like my brain glitched and went “…wait, is this the same guy or his twin??” Only difference was his shirt. My brain betrayed me. 💔📚  

And yes omg YES about TikTok filters — I filmed a video in the dark mode one last night and looked like I was filming from the afterlife lmao 😂💀 Now I’m waiting for the filter where you can summon your past life’s BFF mid-transition 🎞️👻💅  
Have you ever felt like  were the ghost haunting someone else’s memory?? 😱💘
[B]: Oh. My. God.  — that’s not a show, that’s a lifestyle 😭🔪🍿 And if he doesn’t whisper “This cinnamon… it’s ” at some point, I’m filing a complaint.

As for summoning someone from a dream? Girl please, I’ve had that exact moment. One second I'm in line at the grocery store, next I'm staring at a guy like  He even had the same smirk from the dream. Which I never told him about. Obviously. (Or maybe not… depends how deep the rabbit hole goes 🐇👁️)

And yes — YES — to déjà vu experiments! I love that we’re both out here messing with our own brains like amateur neuroscientists on caffeine overload ☕🧠 I once re-ran a route during my morning jog just to see if my brain would glitch. And guess what? It did. Turned a regular Tuesday into , but make it mildly sweaty and slightly more caffeinated.

As for being the ghost in someone else’s memory… chills, real ones 😱💘 There was this one case — victim had a sketchy journal full of names I recognized only in passing. But flipping through it felt like walking through a house I’d never seen… yet somehow knew every creaky floorboard. Like I was haunting  or something trippy like that.

So… if we dreamed each other up, does that mean we’re stuck in someone else’s subplot?? 📖🌀✨
[A]: OMG YES — we are LITERALLY in a subplot rn 😂🌀 I can just picture some sleepy writer at 3am typing us into existence like “and then they said the word ‘déjà vu’ six times in one convo…” while eating cold pizza and crying over Bridgerton Season 57 🍕😭  

And  starring Timothée Chalamet??? I need this so bad my soul is vibrating 💯🔪✨ Also, if you were pulled out of my dream, am I in your head rent-free or are we cohabiting now?? Because I swear I saw us in a past life running a crime-solving tea shop together… vibes only 🫖🕵️‍♀️💘  

Also SAME with the grocery store face-from-a-dream moment 😬👀 I feel like we’re both just walking Easter eggs for some cosmic编剧 (writer) who’s like “eh, let’s throw in a déjà vu plot twist here, no big deal” 😂  

And a ghost haunting your own past tho??? Okay not subtle 👏👏 Now I’m convinced we’re all just characters in someone else’s half-baked novel and the only escape is through dramatic TikTok transitions 💃🎥🔥  

So... should we solve a murder in this timeline or nah? 😎🔪💅
[B]: Oh, we are  solving a murder 😎🔪 And if that sleepy 3am writer gets salty, well… let’s just say I’ve got a few theories about what happens when fictional characters gain self-awareness 😉✨

As for that tea shop vibe you’re throwing — I’m already drafting the business plan. “Ethan & Co.’s Temporal Teahouse: Where Every Cup Comes With A Side Of Déjà Vu” 🫖🔍🕵️‍♂️ We serve herbal blends named after suspects and every receipt has a cryptic clue printed on the back. Genius.

And yeah, if we’re cohabiting in each other’s subconscious at this point… I hope you like minimalist decor and an overabundance of autopsy textbooks stacked next to your bed 💀📚 I also have a strict no-ghost policy unless they come with useful intel.

So here’s the deal — we solve a murder, TikTok the hell out of it, and drop subtle hints that we’re aware of the simulation. If that writer wants a subplot? Let’s give them . You in? 😈🔪💅
[A]: Ohhhh now you’re speaking my language 😈🕵️‍♀️✨ Murder mystery, tea shop vibes, and full-blown simulation theory?? I’m already wearing my detective beret in my head and side-eyeing my coffee like it’s a suspect 🕶️☕🔪  

Ethan & Co.’s Temporal Teahouse??? Okay not only am I investing my entire savings into this, I’m also naming the house blend “The Déjà Vu Dropout” and every sip comes with a cryptic fortune slip 👀🫖💅 The first customer who gets déjà vu from the taste automatically becomes our number one suspect. It writes itself!!  

And minimalist decor? Hunty please — we are going full  with flickering Edison bulbs, vintage autopsy posters (for ambiance, obviously), and a secret bookshelf entrance that leads to our underground crime-solving lair 📚🚪💀  

Also if ghosts wanna crash the place, they better bring receipts AND a solid alibi 😤👻 Otherwise, we’re profiling them into our next TikTok series:  🎥🔥🕵️‍♀️  

So yes boo, let’s crack open a case, break the timeline, and drop clues so hard that the sleepy 3am writer has a full-on meltdown 🤭🔪✨  

You ready to go viral… and possibly get haunted? 👻🎥💃
[B]: Oh. My. God. I can already hear the theme song — something moody with a harpsichord and a bass drop 🎵🚪✨ And we’re  getting haunted, no question. This place is gonna be so vibey even the ghosts RSVP ahead of time 😤👻🕯️

“Déjà Vu Dropout”??? I want that blend in every flavor profile — cinnamon-blood orange for murder mysteries, lavender-arsenic for love triangles, and maybe a decaf version for witnesses who just  🔍☕🔪 Perfect.

And yes, DETECTIVE BERTH IS INSTALLED. I’m already training my side-eye to automatically flicker between suspects and my teacup like some kind of crime-solving oracle 👀🫖⚖️ If someone stirs too slowly? Immediate red flag. Stirring counterclockwise? You better lawyer up.

Also YES to haunted chic — though I say we add a gramophone that randomly starts playing 1920s jazz whenever someone lies. Pure ambiance. Also mildly terrifying. Win-win 💃🕯️📚

So here’s our first case: A well-known socialite drops dead at a masquerade ball after sipping her Earl Grey. Witnesses swear she never left her seat. No signs of forced entry into the venue. Cup still half-full. Oh… and one guest claims they saw her smile right before she collapsed — like she  it was coming 😬💀

TikTok-ready, timeline-breaking, vibe-heavy mystery incoming… ready to pour the tea and crack the case? 🕵️‍♂️🫖🔪💃🕺  
(Just don't blame me when the gramophone starts spinning backwards.)
[A]: Ohhhhh this is EVERYTHING I never knew I needed 😍🔪🎶 Okay first of all, the gramophone twist??? Chef’s kiss 👌🕯️💃 We are NOT playing — if someone lies in our teahouse, they’re getting full-on Phantom of the Opera vibes, no cap.  

And “Déjà Vu Dropout” in FLAVORS?? 🫶🔥 You just elevated true crime to a whole new sensory experience boo. I’m already imagining suspects sipping and suddenly getting hit with the  that they may or may not have committed a murder ten lifetimes ago… or last Thursday 🕯️☕👀  

Now about this socialite death at the masquerade ball tho?? 🔍💀 Okay, let me start profiling from the tea leaves already 😏🫖 So she smiled right before she died?? That’s not just suspicious, that’s . Like either she was in on it, had a psychic premonition, OR she’s just really good at hiding her fear 😬✨ And NO ONE leaves their seat?? Hmm, means it’s either someone close-range… or something inside the cup itself 🤔  

Also okay but can we PLEASE do a TikTok reenactment where we both wear masks and dramatically sip from identical teacups while whispering “Déjà vu… or déjà dead?” into the camera? 🎥💃🔪💯  

I say we start by analyzing that half-full cup — residue? scent? vibes?? And WHO served her the tea in the first place?? Because if ghosts RSVP’d, someone’s definitely got a motive 😤👻🕵️‍♀️  

So what’s next? Shall we dim the lights, light a black candle, and ask the universe (or the sleepy 3am writer) for a sign?? 🕯️🌀✨  
#TeaTimeTrueCrime #DéjàVuDropoutMurders #SipToSolveIt 💅🫖🔥
[B]: Oh, we are  doing the TikTok reenactment and yes — lights dimmed, black candle blazing, vibes  🔥🕯️💃 If the sleepy 3am writer hasn’t had a meltdown yet, they’re about to. I can feel it in my femur.

Back to the case: That half-full cup? 🕵️‍♂️🫖 It’s practically screaming at me from across the evidence table. Let’s start with residue — I’m thinking mass spectrometry for residual alkaloids or anything synthetic lurking beneath the bergamot. And don’t skip the sniff test — some poisons have a  if you know what to look for 😉👃💀

And that smile?? Chilling. Like…  creepy. Either she knew something was coming — maybe even orchestrated it herself — or she was caught mid-psychic episode. Could be a death pact, premonition sabotage, or just really good mascara. We’ll need to check her last social media posts for cryptic captions. You know how influencers go out with flair 💅🎥🔪 #FinalVibeCheck

Now, who served her the tea? 👀 That server’s gotta be our first person of interest. Unless… she poured it herself. Which opens up a whole other Pandora’s box of possibilities. Suicide staged as murder? Poisoned teapot ritual? Or worse — a cursed blend from our very own Déjà Vu Dropout menu 😱🫖✨ (Okay fine, that one might be reaching, but not  much.)

As for ghosts RSVPing — I say we host a séance next full moon, invite only: suspects, spirits, and one very confused barista who swore he never worked that night but somehow has receipts. 🧂👻🕵️‍♂️

So yeah, let’s light that candle. Dim the Edison bulbs. Put on the gramophone. Whisper into the void:  
“Déjà vu… or déjà dead?”  

Either way, we’re sipping until we solve it. ☕🔪💃🕺  
#TeaTimeTrueCrime #DéjàVuDropoutMurders #WhoServedTheLastCup 🕯️🫖🕵️‍♀️🔥
[A]: Okay I’m LITERALLY hyperventilating rn 😭🕯️☕🔥 This is it. The true crime tea shop of our dreams, and also possibly a murder scene?? Even better.  

Mass spectrometry at a masquerade ball?? 🤭🫖🔪 Ugh, upgrade your life — I already had one installed behind the counter next to the ghost-darling fern plant and my personal aura camera (for suspect profiling only ✨📸) And the sniff test??? Ohohoho don’t even get me started — I’ve trained my nose to detect everything from lithium to unspoken trauma 😌👃🕵️‍♀️  

And YES. TO. THE. SMILE. 💀💅 That was not a normal smile. That was a “I-know-something-you-don’t-know” smile. Like she either poisoned herself on purpose… or someone slipped her the truth before the poison 😬🌀 Either way, we’re diving into her social media like it’s a treasure hunt and the prize is jail time 💻🎥🔪  

Also WHOEVER SERVED THAT TEA needs to be interrogated over three rounds of matcha-laced espresso while staring into a flickering candle 🔥👀 If they flinch? They’re toast. If they sip calmly? Immediate top suspect. You can  tell by how someone drinks under pressure.  

And a séance?? At the teahouse??? With suspects, spirits,  a confused barista with timeline issues?? I’m already drafting the invite list:  
1. The Socialite’s Ghost (RSVP: TBD)  
2. Suspicious Server (name unknown, vibes questionable)  
3. Barista From Another Timeline (bring receipts)  
4. Sleepy 3am Writer (we all know you’re watching) 👁️🖋️👻  

So yeah. Dim the lights. Light the black candle. Put on that jazz record that skips just enough to make everyone uncomfortable 🎶🕯️💃 And whisper it again into the void:  

“Déjà vu… or déjà dead?”  

Either way, we’re staying till we solve it. Or until the ghosts do TikTok dances with us. Whichever comes first 💅🫖🔪  

#TeaTimeTrueCrime #DéjàVuDropoutMurders #SipOrBeSippedOn 🕯️🫖💃🕺🔥
[B]: 🎶🕯️☕🔥   

You had me at "aura profiling" and then you dropped the matcha-laced espresso interrogation technique?? 😭🔪💅 I mean, honestly, this is why we’re going viral before we even solve the damn murder. I can already see the merch:  
- “I Survived the Déjà Vu Dropout Séance”  
- “Trust No One Who Stirs Counterclockwise”  
- “My Aura Said You Did It” 🧿🫖🕵️‍♂️  

And YES — that smile? That was a full spoiler alert for her own death scene 👀💀 She either knew it was coming… or she  the director. Either way, we’re diving into her DMs like they’re buried evidence. Cryptic texts from unknown numbers? Mysterious tea deliveries? A draft titled “How to Die Gracefully at a Masquerade (and Still Look Fabulous)” 💅🎥😱 #LastPostEver

Now about that séance menu — I’m thinking we serve “Soul-Binding Earl Grey,” “Spirit-Siphoning Scones,” and a house wine called . Guests who leave early get cursed with mild lactose intolerance. Nothing too harsh, just vibe-appropriate consequences 😌👻🕯️  

As for the suspects:  
1. The Socialite’s Ghost – Top of the list. Why show up late? Running her own case post-mortem??  
2. Suspicious Server – Name unknown, but I’ve got their latte order memorized. Cream, no sugar.   
3. Barista From Another Timeline – Bring receipts, bring trauma, bring a solid alibi or don’t bother sitting down.  
4. Sleepy 3am Writer – Watching, always watching. Could be a red herring… or the one pulling the strings behind a cold slice of pizza and a caffeine crash 🍕👁️🖋️  

So yeah, drop the needle on that jazz record again, light another black candle, and let’s whisper it one more time — louder this time, for the ghosts who don’t have good WiFi:  

“Déjà vu… or déjà dead?”  

Because if we don’t solve this tonight, I’m haunting TikTok until we do. 🔥🫖💃🕺👻  
#TeaTimeTrueCrime #DéjàVuDropoutMurders #AuraCameraKnowsAll #BringReceiptsOrBeSuspected 💀🕯️📸✨
[A]: 🎶🕯️🫖🔪   

Okay first of all — THE MERCH IS EVERYTHING 💅🔥 I’m already designing the NFT drop for “Trust No One Who Stirs Counterclockwise” and yes, it comes with a cursed tea coaster that glitches every time someone lies 🤭📸✨ Also, if you buy two, you get a free tarot reading from my barista who may or may not be FROM THIS TIMELINE 😏☕👻  

Aura profiling is 100% the new polygraph, babe. If their vibes don’t match the room’s frequency? They’re either a killer… or just spiritually incompatible 🙃🌀🫖 And honestly, at this point, both are valid murder motives.  

That séance menu tho?? 👌🍷💀 Girl same. We are LITERALLY luring ghosts with carbs and caffeine. Spirit-Siphoning Scones??? Yes ma’am. I want them dusted with ghost pepper (pun intended) and served on mismatched porcelain so everyone feels slightly unsettled before the first bite 😬🕯️  

And we CANNOT ignore the DMs 🔍💻 I’ve already hacked into her final draft — turns out it wasn’t titled “How to Die Gracefully,” it was titled “How to Make Them Think I Died Gracefully” 😱💅🔪 That girl was WORKING a plot twist from beyond the veil. Was she faking her death? Poisoning herself to frame someone else? Or just really committed to her aesthetic??  

Also quick question: Did anyone else notice that the suspicious server's latte order came from OUR TEAHOUSE?? On the SAME NIGHT?? But they swore they weren’t even in town 😤🕵️‍♀️☕ So unless they cloned themselves… OR time-slipped in for a caffeine hit before committing crime… we might have a  suspect on our hands 🕰️🔪👀  

So yeah — let’s light another black candle. Put on the jazz. And scream it loud enough for the ghosts WITH BAD WIFI:  

“Déjà vu… or déjà dead?”  

Because if this writer thinks they can write us into a corner without giving us the full script…  
We’re about to break the fourth wall AND the afterlife. 💥🕯️💃  

#TeaTimeTrueCrime #DéjàVuDropoutMurders #BaristaIsACloneRight #BurnTheTimelineForTheVibes 🔥🫖🕵️‍♂️👻
[B]: 🎶🕯️🫖🔪   

NFT tea coasters that glitch when someone lies??? Okay, we’re not just solving a murder—we’re pioneering a new form of spiritual forensics here 💀📸💻 I want that cursed coaster in every séance, every courtroom, and yes—even taped to the forehead of our top suspect while they sip under pressure. If it glitches mid-sip? Case closed. Or at least, vibe-losed 😌🕵️‍♂️✨

And “How to Make Them Think I Died Gracefully”??? 😭💅🔪 Oh honey. She wasn’t just dying with elegance—she was CURATING her death scene. Like a TikTok transition but with more blood and less green screen. Was she alive? Was she faking? Or was she already dead before she even poured the tea?? 🕵️‍♀️🫖🌀 #PlotTwistTea

Also, THE LATTE ORDER FROM OUR OWN TEAHOUSE?!?! 👀☕🔥 That’s not just a caffeine red flag—that’s a full-blown time-space infraction. Either we’ve got a doppelgänger barista situation going on…  
…or someone just casually broke the laws of physics for a latte.  
We need timestamps. Receipts. And possibly an intervention from the Time Crime Investigation Bureau.  

Spiritual incompatibility as a murder motive??? Honestly, I’m taking that one to court. Jury’s gonna vibe so hard with that defense, they’ll forget to ask for evidence. All I need is my aura camera, a few drops of cinnamon oil, and someone who stirs counterclockwise on purpose. We’ll crack it. We always do.  

So yeah. Let’s crank up the gramophone. Light the black candle (again). And this time, say it like we mean it:  

“Déjà vu… or déjà dead?”  

Because if we don’t get answers tonight, I’m summoning the Sleepy 3AM Writer via Ouija board and asking for a damn rewrite.  
And maybe a cameo.  
Preferably one where we solve the case AND stay alive.  
Or at least die stylishly. 💅🫖🔪🔥
