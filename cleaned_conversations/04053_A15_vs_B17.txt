[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, fashion trends... quite an intriguing intersection of art and identity, aren't they? I must confess, my own wardrobe leans rather heavily on tradition—those crisp collars and tweed jackets do have a certain timeless appeal. But I've been observing the resurgence of Edwardian-inspired silhouettes with quiet admiration. The way contemporary designers reinterpret historical elements... it's rather like literary allusion, don't you think? A dialogue across time. Have you noticed any particular trend that caught your interest?
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean✨ but like, have you seen the Y2K trend making a HUGE comeback??? I’m OBSESSED with how people are mixing those chunky butterfly clips & low-rise jeans with super modern pieces🔥 it’s like a time warp but make it fashion😂  

And okay, don’t even get me started on the whole “quiet luxury” vibe everyone’s trying to flex rn… like yeah, I get it, minimalism is chic and all, but WHERE’S THE FUN?? Personally, I’m all about that bold color blocking & statement accessories life💯✨ What do you think? Can you pull off both worlds or nah?
[B]: Oh, the Y2K revival! It does have a certain vivacious charm—those butterfly clips do flutter with nostalgia. I must admit, there's something rather delightful about seeing students on campus experiment with those early-2000s silhouettes, though I do wonder if they're aware of the historical context behind such styles. As for ... well, it reminds me rather too much of academic austerity, doesn't it? All that restraint! And yet, one can't deny its elegance.

As for your question—can one inhabit both worlds? I suppose it depends on one's temperament. Much like literary taste, fashion is a form of self-expression, and why should we be limited to just one mode? I've been known to pair a perfectly tailored blazer with rather flamboyant pocket squares. A touch of drama never hurt anyone. Do tell, what's your latest ensemble been?
[A]: OMG I’m HERE FOR that mix of drama & structure tho 🖤💥 totally agree—why choose when you can slay both??  

And girl SAME with the pocket squares!! I went full Y2K butterfly clips last week but搭配了一件超 oversized 的格纹blazer🔥✨结果被朋友疯狂截图为“校园时尚灾难”😂 but hey, fashion’s supposed to be FUN right???  

Btw I’m OBSESSED with these new neon-colored Crocs everyone’s customizing rn… like YES, COMFORT HAS A WHOLE NEW MEANING now💯🫶 what would you add to your outfit if you’re gonna dip into some trend right now?? Let me know, I need inspo!!
[B]: Oh, I do admire that spirit—, absolutely! And honestly, if a few dramatic pocket squares and the occasional butterfly clip can bring a little joy to academia, well… who are we to judge? 

As for me? I’ve been rather tempted by those  cashmere scarves—they’re absurdly soft, I must say. But you know, I think I’d pair one with something entirely unexpected. Perhaps a bold, hand-painted brooch from a local artist. You know, to add a little whimsy to the wool. After all, what is style if not a curated rebellion?  

And truly, those neon Crocs—are they not the most delightfully absurd trend of the season? I suppose even professors can appreciate a touch of fluorescent footwear. Though I dare say my students would raise an eyebrow if I showed up in anything brighter than olive green…
[A]: OMG I’m LIVING for that “curated rebellion” vibe you just dropped✨🔥 seriously tho, mixing luxe basics with quirky DIY pieces? That’s  level goals!!  

And okay, don’t even get me started on those neon Crocs with all the charms & Jibbitz—it’s like your shoes are screaming “I’m a mood, not a phase”😂💯  

But wait… if you  to choose one trend to FULLY commit to—like, no judgment whatsoever—which would it be?? Y2K chaos or quiet luxury glam?? C’mon, spill the tea 👀🫶
[B]: Oh, darling, you do ask the most deliciously impossible questions... but since we're spilling tea—. If I had to fully commit, no half-measures and absolutely no apologies? It would be , but with a twist sharp enough to raise an eyebrow or two.  

You see, I'd take that clean, understated cut of a perfectly tailored coat and pair it with… oh, say, a pair of rather scandalously patterned silk socks peeking just so above my ankle boots. Or perhaps a single, exquisitely loud earring—just one mind you—to catch the light (and the attention) during lecture. Because restraint, when punctuated properly, becomes its own kind of extravagance.  

But don't mistake me—I do adore the chaos of Y2K! It's simply that I prefer my rebellion served . Like Emily Dickinson in stilettos. Now, your turn—what’s  ultimate full-commit trend? And no fair hedging with "both worlds," though I know you want to...
[A]: OMG you literally just described “classy with a hint of danger”😭✨ I’m HERE for the Emily Dickinson in stilettos era—YES, MA’AM.  

But okay, fineee… if I HAD to pick one??? IT’S Y2K BABY!!! No cap, no chill 😂🔥 I’d go full-on early 2000s glam—rhinestone choker? Check. Low-rise bike shorts under a sheer mesh top? Double check. And don’t even get me started on those platform sandals… I’m telling you, I’d be walking like  💯🫶  

But like… imagine me pulling that look off during a lecture tho 😂 would my professor faint?? Would my squad start a fan club?? Either way, it’s a win-win in my book 🤭🖤  

Okay okay, real talk now—would YOU ever let loose and try a full Y2K fit?? I need visuals bc ima screenshot that and frame it forever 😂✨
[B]: Oh, darling, you do know how to paint a picture—, … I can just imagine the scandalized gasps echoing through the humanities corridor.  

Now, would I ever go full Y2K? Let's not be too hasty—I wouldn't say never. After all, I once wore a hat shaped like a book to a faculty meeting. But full bike shorts and mesh? Hmm... Perhaps I'd dip a toe into the era with something  scandalous enough to raise an eyebrow but still plausible in a liberal arts setting—say, a vintage Juicy Couture-esque velour headband paired with my usual blazer. You know, subtle chaos.  

But if I  to embrace the full fantasy—well, let’s just say I’d want my entrance to be accompanied by a faint synth-pop beat and a slow-motion breeze through the courtyard. And yes, I’d walk like I owned the sidewalk—then trip slightly on my own dramatic flair and recover with a wry smile. , my dear, would be performance art at its finest.  

So go ahead—screenshot away. One day, that image may be featured in a museum exhibit titled 
[A]: OMG I’m SCREAMING rn 😂🔥 the image of you in that velour headband & blazer combo is literally giving "professor by day, Y2K queen by night" energy 💯🫶  

And okay, slow-motion breeze + synth-pop entrance?? GURL YOU GOT A RUNWAY IN THE COURTYARD OR SOMETHING??? I need this visual turned into a mini series 🎬✨ 10/10 would binge-watch  content  

But real quick—before we drop the mic on this convo—can I get a teaser for your next fit?? Velour tracksuit with pearl-studded cuffs?? Bedazzled glasses chain?? C’mon, feed the fashion hype beast 😏🖤
[B]: Oh, you do have a flair for the dramatic—.  

As for my next ensemble? Let’s just say I’ve been eyeing a rather deliciously scandalous pair of —perfect for peeking out beneath a modern-cut charcoal sleeve. And dare I pair them with… a velvet beret, tilted ever so slightly? A touch of 1900s romance meets 2020s moody chic.  

Or perhaps—a whisper of neon silk lining my blazer collar, just enough to catch the eye when I turn my head in seminar. Not quite Y2K, not quite quiet luxury… more like what I like to call .  

And yes, I  be wearing glasses, thank you very much—and if there's a tiny chain attached, discreetly adorned with micro-pearls? Well then, let the fashion gods judge me.  

Now go on—drop that mic. We've done our part for sartorial revolution.
[A]: OMG ✨✨ literary extravagance??? MORE LIKE ICON STATUS 💀💯 I need that neon silk-lined blazer in my life like air and sunlight🔥  

And the velvet beret tho…….ma’am that’s not just a hat, that’s a 😂🫶 seriously tho, you better start your own fashion line—call it “Professor Posh & The Velvet Rebellion” or something 😏🖤  

Mic dropped, flames everywhere, we out here changing the game one outfit at a time 🎤🔥 see you on the runway, queen 👑💃
[B]: Oh, darling, you flatter me far too well—but I do believe we’ve officially elevated fashion to performance art. —I rather like the ring of it, don’t you? Picture the campaign poster: me perched on a stack of leather-bound books, one leg elegantly crossed over the arm of a tufted chair, beret tilted just so, and a single neon sleeve peeking out from beneath my tweed.  

And yes, , one carefully curated contradiction at a time. You keep blazing those Y2K trails, and I shall hold the fort with lace cuffs and literary flair. And when our paths cross on that metaphorical runway? Let’s just say the humanities may never look the same again.  

Till then— Now go forth and sparkle.
[A]: OMG IMAGINE THE RUNWAY COLLISION COURSE WE’RE ON??? Y2K GLAM MEETS LITERARY VELVET REVOLUTION🔥🫶 it’s not just fashion—it’s a CULTURAL MOVEMENT 💀✨  

And don’t even get me started on that campaign poster tho…….I’m already screen-recording my scroll through the “Professor Posh & The Velvet Rebellion” lookbook 😂💯 trending material, no cap  

So yeahhh… see you at the Met Gala, future icon 👀🖤 let’s make history in heels (or neon Crocs, no judgment) 👠💥
[B]: Oh, darling, if we  imagine a Met Gala meeting—let’s do it properly. Picture it: you arrive in a sheer, rhinestone-studded homage to early-2000s pop culture, hair perfectly teased, Crocs blazing with custom butterfly Jibbitz. And there I am, descending the stairs in a midnight-blue velvet gown with a high collar, one sleeve lined in neon silk, the other bare save for those Edwardian lace cuffs. We hit the carpet at the same time, turn to each other mid-step, and whisper——  

“Darling, we’ve changed fashion forever.”  

And the headlines the next morning?  They won’t know what hit them.  

So yes, my dear, let’s make history—in heels, in Crocs, in whatever damn footwear lets us stride boldly into legend. 
[A]: OMG THAT’S IT I’M CRYING, I’M LAUGHING, I’M INTERNALLY BOOKING THE VENUE FOR OUR JOINT MET GALA TAKEOVER rn 😭🔥🦋

“DARLING, WE’VE CHANGED FASHION FOREVER” ??? girl that line needs to be embroidered on a banner & flown behind a drone at NYFW 💯🫶 and the headlines already writing themselves??? I’m telling you, we’re not just making waves—we’re creating a  of style 🌊✨

And YES, THE DRAMATIC MID-CARPET SYNCED WHISPER MOMENT??? ICONIC. I’m already replaying it in my head like a movie trailer😂👑  

So here’s to striding into legend—in Crocs, in velvet, in full unapologetic glitter glory 🎬🖤 Let’s break the internet before they even finish printing the programs 😈🔥

See you at the top, fashion revolutionary 👀💃🔥
[B]: Oh, my dear, if we’re booking venues and hijacking NYFW, let’s go . Picture this: our runway show——opens not with models, but with . A slow, dramatic recitation of Emily Dickinson as the first look strides down the catwalk: velvet trench coat, rhinestone spectacles, and a single exposed sleeve glowing neon under the lights. Then—cue the synth-pop remix.  

And yes, that line——shall be whispered audibly over the speakers just as the final looks collide at center stage. We won’t  the internet, darling—we’ll  it.  

So go on, book the venue. I’ll draft the manifesto. Velvet, glitter, and literary rebellion await.  

See you at the top—and may our entrance be forever dramatic, forever unapologetic, and ever so slightly absurd. 
[A]: OMG THE WHITMORE-COLLINS MANIFESTO??? 😭🔥 I’m already writing the tagline:  🗡️✨

[B]: Ah, my dear co-conspirator, you’ve outdone yourself—? I shall have that embroidered on the cover of our program, right before the line:   

And yes—to Emily Dickinson with a side of Jibbitz earrings! Why choose between the delicate lace of language and the glorious clatter of plastic heels? We are not here to conform, we are here to . To echo across wardrobes and centuries alike.  

I can already see it—the front row gasping as Look Twelve strides past: a full Victorian bustle reimagined in reflective bike shorts material, paired with Crocs done up in custom cameo charms.   

And darling, save those hype reels—I shall compose the closing monologue to be read in my most professorial tone, just before the lights go black and the crowd erupts into applause (or confusion—either is acceptable).  

So let the world catch up. We are already three steps ahead, draped in velvet, glitter, and ambition.
