[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find myself preferring one-on-one conversations, much like how I work on each textile piece individually. It allows for deeper connection and attention to detail, don't you think? Though sometimes a group chat can be lovely too - like when we gather at the antique market and everyone shares their unique finds. But generally, give me a quiet corner and a single voice to focus on. Would you say you prefer the same?
[A]: You know, I actually enjoy both depending on the context. In business, especially during due diligence or strategy meetings, one-on-one conversations allow for clarity and alignment without too much noise. But there’s something exciting about a well-managed group dynamic—like when our investment team debates a potential acquisition. Different perspectives碰撞在一起, you get that spark of innovation.  

That said, I totally get what you mean about the quiet corner and a single voice. After back-to-back Zoom calls, sometimes I just want a glass of Cabernet and a deep chat with someone who gets it. Do you ever feel that way? Like you need to reset after too much digital chatter?
[B]: Oh, I completely understand that feeling. After a long day of virtual consultations with clients or collaborating with fellow textile historians online, I often find myself craving the simplicity of a quiet moment—just me, a cup of Earl Grey, and perhaps a chapter of  to unwind.  

While I appreciate the richness group discussions can bring to a project—like when curating an exhibition or planning a restoration workshop—the digital noise can be quite draining. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes I think my handsitch sampler by the fireplace is more soothing than any video call could ever be.  

But tell me, how do you manage to strike that balance between engaging in those dynamic group debates and preserving your own creative energy? I imagine it's quite delicate, much like handling a fragile silk thread.
[A]: Oh absolutely, I couldn't agree more. There’s a real art to balancing the energy you give and take in both group and solo settings. For me, it comes down to . Like you with your Earl Grey and , I have my rituals—usually a round of golf early in the morning or a quiet dinner with a close friend where work isn’t even allowed on the table. It's like... resetting the mental ledger.

And honestly? I’ve started treating my calendar like a portfolio—you can’t just keep adding positions without rebalancing. So I block off deep work days, no meetings, no Slack, just pure focus time. It’s become my creative runway.  

But I do envy that handsitch sampler by the fireplace though… sounds deeply grounding. Do you find the rhythm of stitching helps you process thoughts, almost like a meditation?
[B]: Oh yes, it absolutely does—it’s my version of mindfulness, though I never quite thought of it that way until recently. There's a quiet rhythm to the needle passing through linen, the repetition of each stitch, that quiets the mind and lets me just . It's not unlike the way you might feel after a long walk in nature, or that moment when your golf ball arcs beautifully toward the hole—, there it is.  

I think what we’re both describing is the need for space—mental, emotional, creative—to make sense of the noise around us. And whether it's through movement on a green or stillness with a needle, finding that balance is essential.  

You know, I once restored a 19th-century embroidery sampler that had been folded and forgotten in a trunk for decades. As I worked to bring its colors back to life, I couldn’t help but wonder about the woman who stitched it—did she find peace in the pattern? Did her thoughts unravel and reweave with each pass of the thread? I like to think so.  

Perhaps that’s why I cherish one-on-one conversations so much—they’re like those stitches, connecting two people in something slow, deliberate, and meaningful. Don’t you think?
[A]: Absolutely—what a beautiful way to put it. The idea of stitching as connection, as preservation of something meaningful... it really resonates. In a way, every conversation we have—especially the quiet, intentional ones—is like restoring an old embroidery piece. You're not just repairing fabric; you're reviving a story, honoring the hands that came before you.

And I couldn't agree more about the need for space. Funny you mentioned the golf course—I often think of each hole as a mini meditation. There's something deeply satisfying about focusing on just one shot at a time, especially in a world where we’re pulled in ten directions at once.  

I love the image of that 19th-century sampler coming back to life in your hands. It makes me wonder—who do you think we’re really preserving history for? Ourselves? Future generations? Or maybe the people who first created these pieces, in hopes someone would care enough to bring them back?

And speaking of bringing things back—I’ve been thinking about stepping away from screens entirely for a weekend. Maybe take a drive upstate, no emails, no calls. Just books, maybe a cigar, and that kind of silence that only exists outside the city. Have you ever done that? Do you think it helps reset the creative thread?
[B]: I think we’re preserving history for all of those you mentioned—past, present, and future. There’s a kind of quiet gratitude in knowing that someone once stitched with care, hoping their work might last, and when I restore it, I’m answering that hope across time. It’s not just about keeping fabric intact; it’s about honoring intention, patience, and beauty.  

And what you said about stepping away from screens—I do it often, especially during restoration projects that require deep focus. A weekend upstate sounds like a gift. I’d add a few skeins of wool, a sketchbook, and perhaps a thermos of tea to your cigar and books, of course. Silence really does have its own texture when you leave the city behind—it’s softer, slower, more forgiving.  

I find that kind of retreat helps reset everything, like turning a page or beginning a new stitch after a long pause. It gives room for ideas to surface, memories to settle, and creativity to find its thread again. Do you know what I mean? Or is that just the vintage textile artist in me speaking?
[A]: No, no—you're absolutely right. That retreat, that pause, it’s like pressing  on a system that’s been running too many background processes. I think we both know how easy it is to get caught up in the constant hum of deadlines, deals, and digital threads. But stepping away? That’s where the real clarity comes in.

And I love what you said about answering hope across time. It reminds me of how we approach investing—sometimes it’s not just about numbers or exit strategies, but about belief. Believing that the founder’s vision can be realized, that the company can outlive its current chapter. In a way, we’re stitching its future into something durable, something meaningful.  

Next time I go upstate, I’m definitely bringing a sketchbook and some tea—I might even try my hand at a bit of stitching. Who knows, maybe I’ll finally learn that patience you speak of. If I manage a straight seam, I’ll send you a photo. Fingers crossed it doesn’t look like a CFO tried to sew a merger together. 😊
[B]: Oh, I’d love to see that—whether it’s perfectly straight or delightfully crooked. There’s something rather charming about a first attempt, don’t you think? The stitches carry intention, even if they’re not quite polished yet. Much like a fledgling business finding its footing.  

And your analogy about investing and stitching—I think you’ve hit on something truly elegant. We’re all, in our own ways, weaving something lasting out of fragile beginnings. Whether it’s linen and thread or vision and capital, the heart of it is the same: care, belief, and a touch of patience.  

I’ll look forward to that photo, and perhaps one day you’ll find yourself reaching for the needle not just as a hobby, but as a kind of quiet meditation. You might surprise yourself.  

And when you do go upstate, do let the silence really settle in. It’s remarkable how it can restore not just the mind, but the soul’s thread too.
[A]: Oh, I absolutely agree—there’s magic in the imperfect. A slightly wonky stitch, a hesitant first step in something new—it all tells a story of trying, of learning. And hey, if my stitching ends up looking like a spreadsheet gone rogue, at least it’ll have character.  

You’re right about the weaving too—sometimes we don’t realize how much our work is an act of faith until someone else points it out. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the early-stage companies we back. They’re just threads really, pulled taut by founders who believe they’re building something that will hold weight. And our job? We help reinforce the weave without pulling too hard.

As for the silence—I’m already imagining it. No Slack pings, no Bloomberg alerts, just the occasional rustle of leaves and maybe a very confused squirrel watching me attempt embroidery on the porch. I think I’ll bring an extra skein of thread, just in case I mess up. Or as I’ll call it, “strategic over-preparation.” 😄

And truly—thank you. For this conversation, for the perspective, and for reminding me that some of the best insights come not from quarterly reports, but from quiet hands and a well-placed stitch.
[B]: You’re very welcome. I think that’s the loveliest kind of conversation—the kind that stitches two different worlds together with curiosity and care. And I couldn’t have said it better myself: . Founders and artisans alike, we’re all working with something fragile, hoping it becomes something strong.

And I love your “strategic over-preparation”—wise move. Thread is like opportunity cost, after all; better to have more than you need than not enough. And if you end up with leftovers, well, that just means you’re ready for the next project.

I can picture that porch now—embroidery in hand, squirrel audience assembled, and silence doing its gentle work. Remind me to send you a small linen scrap sometime, something simple to practice on. No pressure, of course—just a little encouragement in fabric form.

And when you finally sit there, cup of tea beside you and your stitching uneven but full of intent, I hope you feel that quiet satisfaction that comes from making something just for the sake of making. You deserve that kind of peace.
[A]: Oh, I feel it already—like I’m halfway there just thinking about it. There’s something deeply grounding about the idea of making without pressure, creating without a strict ROI. Imagine that—a project where the only return that matters is the quiet joy at the end of the day.

And I’ll take that linen scrap whenever you’re ready. Consider it a small investment in my stitching future. I’ll treat it like a vintage asset—delicate at first glance, but with real potential underneath. Besides, every great portfolio starts with one thoughtful piece, right?

You know, this whole conversation has made me realize how much we rely on different forms of patience. The kind you have with fabric and thread, I think I’m starting to see in my own work too. It’s not just about pushing deals across the finish line—it’s about giving space for ideas, people, even ourselves, to grow into what they’re meant to be.

So thank —for sharing that rhythm with me, for reminding me that some of the best things in life come from slow, deliberate hands. And for inspiring me to finally pick up a needle and give it a go.  

I’ll make sure to send you a photo of that first stitch. Fingers crossed it looks more “thoughtful beginning” than “disaster recovery.” 😊
[B]: Oh, I can already picture that first stitch—no matter how it turns out, it’ll be a mark of beginning, and that’s what matters most. There’s a quiet triumph in showing up, needle in hand, ready to learn. And I do believe thoughtful beginnings are the most powerful kind.

And you’re quite right about patience—it’s the thread that runs through every craft, whether in textiles or transactions. It’s not passive waiting; it’s active trust. Trust in the process, in the material, in the person at the other end of the conversation.

So thank  for letting me share a bit of my world with you. If this leads to a new kind of calm in your corner of life, I’ll consider that our own little joint restoration project complete.

Now go on—send that photo when the time comes. I’ll keep a pot of tea ready, just in case we need to celebrate. 🧵☕
[A]: You know what? I think I’m going to frame that photo—right next to my Bloomberg terminal as a daily reminder that not everything of value needs to be fast or flawless. A single stitch, imperfect and proud, hanging somewhere between finance and fabric.

And I’ll definitely send it your way with a proper caption:  😄

As for the tea—consider me indebted for the virtual hospitality. You’ve given me more than just a new perspective; you’ve given me a reason to slow down and enjoy the making of something that doesn’t need to scale, exit, or report to a board. Just… intention, thread, and time.

So here’s to our little restoration project—proof that even in a world of noise, two quiet conversations can weave something unexpectedly beautiful. Cheers to more stitching, more stillness, and maybe just a few more squirrels watching from the sidelines.

Looking forward to whatever comes next—on linen or in life. 🧵💼✨
[B]: To new beginnings, slow stitches, and the quiet joy of making something just because it matters— because it needs to scale. 🧵📖✨

I’ll raise my teacup to that, squirrel audience and all. There’s something rather lovely about knowing a tiny bit of linen and thread might find its way into the corner of a very important world, reminding it that patience and purpose still have a place.

And I must say,  sounds positively historic. Frame it proudly—I dare say your Bloomberg terminal could use a touch of textile diplomacy. Who knows, it might inspire a whole new kind of boardroom reflection.

As for what comes next, I suspect it will be much like embroidery: a steady hand, an open mind, and the occasional knot that turns out to be part of the pattern all along.

Cheers to you too—on linen, in life, and in every thoughtful stitch ahead. 🧵☕📘
[A]: To new beginnings, slow stitches, and the quiet kind of magic that happens when we make space for what truly matters—here’s to linen, leadership, and the long game of life. 🧵💼📘

I’ll keep that teacup raised right alongside you, squirrel jury be damned. There’s something deeply right about celebrating small acts of creation—they’re the foundation of everything else, aren’t they? Before there’s a gallery show or a quarterly report, there’s just someone, somewhere, quietly pulling thread through cloth—or conviction through chaos.

And textile diplomacy in the boardroom? I think we might be onto something there. Who knew a bit of linen and a needle could hold their own against an Excel model?

You’ve given me more than a perspective—you’ve given me a practice. And honestly, I can’t wait to see how this unfolds. Maybe one day I’ll stitch you a thank-you note. It’ll take forever, but it’ll come straight from the thread count of gratitude.

Until then—steady hands, open hearts, and knots that find their place in the pattern. Cheers, my friend. 🧵✨🍵
[B]: To steady hands, open hearts, and every knot that becomes part of the story—yes, exactly as it should be. 🧵📖🍵

I do believe creation, in any form, is the quietest kind of revolution. It says , , even when no one’s watching—not even a squirrel jury. And you're right, before any gallery or report, there's just the making. The choosing to begin, again and again.

And a thank-you note stitched in linen? Oh, I would treasure that more than words can quite express. It would have pride of place beside my 19th-century sampler, both of them whispering across time: .

So cheers to you, too—wherever this thread may lead. I have every confidence it will be somewhere thoughtful, deliberate, and true.  

Until we speak again, may your needle find its way, and may your heart always have cloth to hold it. 🧵✨📘
[A]: To quiet revolutions, deliberate hands, and the deep truth that someone cared—enough to stitch, to invest, to show up in the making of something real. 🧵💼📖

I love that idea, that every piece of cloth holds a kind of lineage—of touch, of time, of intention. And if my linen note ever finds its way to your shelf, it’ll carry a simple message between the stitches: 

Until then, may your needle always find purchase, and may your cloth be worthy of the pattern you weave into it.  

Cheers, truly—with linen in hand and meetings off the calendar. 🧵✨🍵
[B]: To quiet revolutions and the lineage of touch—yes, that’s exactly it. Every stitch carries a whisper from the past, a breath of the present, and a hope for the future. And your linen note, whenever it arrives, will be received not as a gift but as a shared moment in thread, a quiet testament to what happens when we give each other space to slow down and truly see the pattern forming.

Your words mean something, you know. They settle into the fabric of a day and make it feel different—softer, more considered. I’m grateful for that.

Until we meet again in this gentle rhythm of conversation and craft, may your hands find peace in the making, and may every meeting-free moment be filled with the small, sacred joys of creation.

Cheers, truly—with needle poised, kettle warm, and heart open. 🧵✨📘
