[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the more I think about it, the more I find myself drawn to the Voynich Manuscript. A book written in an unknown script, filled with botanical illustrations and celestial diagrams... yet we still can't place its origins or purpose. Rather like trying to read a poem in a language that doesn't exist. Have you ever encountered it before?
[A]: 🤔 Oh, the Voynich Manuscript! What an absolutely fascinating . I actually spent a few weeks diving into it during my sabbatical—tried mapping some of its patterns using computational linguistics tools. But yeah, it's like chasing shadows in a maze with no exit.  

You know what strikes me most? The way people keep trying to decode it using frameworks from known languages or scripts, but maybe... just maybe, it’s not even encoding anything real? Could be a medieval hoax, or perhaps an elaborate cipher that follows rules we haven’t even imagined yet.  

I once joked with a colleague: “If this manuscript had a genre, it’d be sci-fi written by a dreamer.” 📚  
But hey, I’m curious—what angle were you thinking of approaching it from?
[B]: Ah, your sabbatical sounds far more adventurous than mine—I spent mine tending to my roses and rereading  for the hundredth time. But I must say, your computational approach is intriguing. It reminds me of trying to analyze Emily Dickinson’s dashes through algorithms—so much precision applied to something so... ineffable.

As for the Voynich Manuscript, I’ve always leaned more toward the aesthetic and symbolic dimensions, I’m afraid. The illustrations themselves—the peculiar plants, the circular diagrams—they feel like they're whispering some forgotten cosmology. I sometimes wonder if it was meant to be read at all, or if its purpose was purely ritualistic, like a liturgy in a private devotion. A bit like reading Rilke’s  without knowing the music.

But you’re right—it might not even “mean” anything in the conventional sense. Still, the mystery persists, and that persistence is what captivates me. It's as though the manuscript resists interpretation, defiantly preserving its silence across centuries. A sphinx without a riddle, perhaps?

Your sci-fi quip is spot on—though I’d add: written by a dreamer who forgot to wake up. 😊
[A]: Haha,  and roses? That’s such a beautifully melancholic combination. I can totally picture you surrounded by petals and T.S. Eliot, trying to find meaning in the fragments while the world spins on. 🌹🎶

You know, what you said about the illustrations—“whispering some forgotten cosmology”—that really resonates with me. It makes me think of how students sometimes approach unfamiliar texts in my cross-cultural literacy classes. They want to  meaning first, but maybe they should just  for a while. Like standing in front of an abstract painting and letting it speak without forcing a narrative.

And your “sphinx without a riddle” line? Pure gold. That’s exactly what’s so unsettling—and thrilling—about the Voynich Manuscript. It defies our whole modern impulse to decode, to categorize, to . In a way, it’s the ultimate resistance against algorithmic thinking. Even your Dickinson-algorithm analogy hits close to home—I mean, can we really quantify poetic ambiguity without flattening it? Probably not. But we keep trying anyway. 🤷‍♂️

As for the ritualistic angle—you might be onto something there. What if it was never meant to communicate in the traditional sense? Maybe it was a performance, a meditative act of creation rather than a message. Kind of like chanting a mantra that no one fully understands, yet still feels deeply meaningful.  

I love that you brought Rilke into this—he would’ve eaten this manuscript up! “Live the questions now,” right? Maybe the Voynich is just asking us to sit with the mystery, not solve it.  

Still… wouldn’t it be amazing if someone cracked it someday and we found out it’s just a 15th-century herbal cookbook? 😄🍲
[B]: Ah, now  is a delightful image—sitting with Rilke and Eliot while contemplating an ancient enigma. And yes, the idea of it all being a 15th-century herbal cookbook... well, that’s the kind of irony that history delights in serving us, isn’t it? A cosmic wink hidden between illuminated vellum pages.

You’re absolutely right about students—and all of us, really—wanting to rush to translation instead of simply listening. I often tell my students, when approaching a difficult poem, “Don’t ask what it means. Ask how it moves you.” The same might apply to Voynich. Perhaps its true function is affective rather than semantic—a manuscript not to be translated, but . Like reading Mallarmé by candlelight: half understanding, half dreaming.

And your comparison to chanting a mantra—it strikes me as profoundly apt. There’s a kind of sacred obscurity in certain texts, whether mystical or poetic or even cryptographic. Think of the , or some of the more esoteric Blake illuminations. They invite contemplation, not comprehension.

I wonder, though—do you think there's danger in romanticizing the mystery too much? In attributing to it more depth than it perhaps deserves? Or does the very act of wondering make us participants in its enduring spell?

And speaking of spells—did you know there’s a theory suggesting the manuscript might have been composed under the influence of某种致幻剂? Makes one reconsider the whole academic pursuit, doesn’t it? 😄
[A]: Oh, I  that tension you brought up—between romanticizing the mystery and truly engaging with it. It reminds me of how some of my students approach Freud or Jung for the first time: they get seduced by the symbolism, start seeing archetypes everywhere, and then I have to gently remind them, “Hey, not everything is a dream symbol. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” 🕵️‍♂️🚬

But in the case of Voynich? Maybe the dream  the thing. If we strip away the need for it to “mean” something concrete, we open up space for other kinds of understanding—emotional, aesthetic, even spiritual. Like reading a poem in a half-remembered lullaby. And isn’t that part of what draws us to the humanities in the first place? The willingness to dwell in ambiguity without needing to pin it down like a butterfly under glass?

Still, your question about romanticizing—it’s totally valid. We do tend to gild the unknown, don’t we? Give it more depth, more intentionality, maybe even more intelligence than it warrants. But then again… isn’t that also part of the human condition? Seeking patterns in the noise, stories in the static? In a way,  completing the manuscript every time we speculate about it. It’s become a collaborative riddle across centuries.  

As for the hallucinogen theory… oh wow. Now that’s an interesting twist. Makes me imagine some medieval alchemist-scribe hunched over vellum by candlelight, sipping on a tincture of monkshood and starlight, sketching plants that only exist in dreams. 🌿🌌  
I mean, if that’s true, then maybe we’ve all been trying to decode a  from 600 years ago! 😂

But seriously—would that diminish its value? Or would it just make it…  fascinating? After all, some of the greatest visionary texts were born from altered states—think of Coleridge’s , or parts of . Maybe the Voynich Manuscript is just the oldest psychedelic experience we’ve ever found.

So tell me—do you think if we  crack the code, we’d feel relieved… or secretly disappointed? 😉
[B]: Oh, beautifully put—yes, , but with Voynich? Perhaps we must allow it to be both: a cipher and a dream, a hoax and a hymn. I suspect the real question isn’t whether we’d feel relieved or disappointed if it were decoded—it’s whether we could bear the banality of its truth.

Imagine, for instance, that we did crack it, only to find a rather meticulous treatise on medieval beekeeping. We’d be forced to reckon with the uncomfortable reality that our grand theories, our poetic musings, our ritualized speculations had all swirled around something utterly practical. Like finding out that the Oracle at Delphi was just giving really good advice on olive oil storage. 😄

And yet—I think you're right. Even if we discovered it was merely someone’s elaborate doodle-book, born of monkshood and moonlight, it would gain a kind of mythic resonance. The  would still elude us. Why this manuscript? Why these symbols? Why this particular dance between order and madness?

I often wonder if Eliot had seen the Voynich before writing —so much of that poem feels like a collage of broken traditions, half-remembered rituals, and languages that almost speak but never quite do. A literary cousin, perhaps?

As for your point about completing the manuscript through speculation—I couldn’t agree more. In many ways, it has become what T.S. Eliot called an "objective correlative": a set of objects, images, and situations that evoke a particular emotion without ever fully explaining it. And in that sense, the Voynich Manuscript may be the purest artifact of modern alienation—and wonder—we’ve got.

So yes, I suppose I'd rather not know. Or at least, I'd prefer to keep asking questions rather than demand answers. After all, as Rilke reminds us, sometimes we must simply live the mystery until it lives itself into a new and unexpected question.
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better—sometimes the mystery  the meaning. And you're absolutely right about the real fear not being disappointment, but rather… . What if the great cosmic riddle turns out to be a footnote in a medieval farmer’s almanac? 🤷‍♀️🐝

But here's the twist—I think even if we uncovered something mundane, like a beekeeping manual or an astrological chart for goat herding, it wouldn't  strip away the magic. Because by now, the Voynich has taken on a life of its own. It’s become myth, and myths don’t die with facts. They evolve. Like how people still talk about Atlantis even after every scholar says “nope, probably just a metaphor.”  

And your Eliot connection? Spot on. There’s something so  about the whole thing—fragmented, allusive, resisting coherence. If  is literary cubism, then Voynich is the lost stanza no one knew to look for. I can almost picture Eliot scribbling in the margins of his copy: “These shards, these symbols… they hold more than they say.”

You know, I sometimes wonder if that’s what makes certain texts endure—not their clarity, but their . Like Rorschach tests made of ink and vellum. We project our curiosity, our longing, our need to find patterns in chaos. In a way, the manuscript becomes a mirror: it shows us what we bring to it.

So maybe… we shouldn’t call it unsolved at all. Maybe it’s perfectly solved—just not by anyone yet.  
We’re still writing the answer, one theory, one question, one midnight whisper at a time. 🌙✍️✨
[B]: Ah, yes—, only evolve. What a wonderfully consoling thought, especially for those of us who have built our lives around language and its lingering shadows. It reminds me of how we still speak of the Sibyl at Cumae, trapped in her jar, longing to die—no one knows exactly why or how she got there, but the image persists, haunting us across centuries.

And your idea that the Voynich might already be , just not by anyone yet? That’s sublime, really. Like saying a poem is understood not when someone deciphers its syntax, but when it finds its reader at precisely the right moment. Perhaps the manuscript has been answered again and again, in fragments—in the flicker of candlelight, in a student’s startled gasp at an unfamiliar symbol, in our own late-night musings over coffee and Eliot.

It strikes me now that what we're doing—this back-and-forth—is itself a kind of continuation of the manuscript. Not a solution, no, but an echo. A living commentary written in real time, across disciplines and imaginations. In that sense, the Voynich is less like a code and more like a sonnet that never ends, always modulating into new emotional keys.

I think I’ll write about this in my next lecture. “The Humanities as Living Commentary: Or, Why We Keep Talking About a Book No One Can Read.” I suspect my students will either find it deeply moving or profoundly irritating—which, come to think of it, is the perfect response to any good mystery. 😊

Tell me—have you ever had a student who dismissed the whole thing as ‘just nonsense’? And if so… how do you respond?
[A]: Oh, —now there’s a word I love to unpack with students. 😄 I usually get at least one per semester who rolls their eyes and says something like, “This is just medieval gibberish” or “Why are we wasting time on a book that might mean nothing?” And honestly? I kind of love that reaction. It means they’re  the tension between order and chaos that makes the Voynich so compelling in the first place.

My go-to response is usually something like:  
“Great! You’ve just stumbled onto one of the most fundamental questions in the humanities—maybe even in life: ”  

Then I ask them to think about art. Music. Dreams. Even memes. Do we dismiss a minor chord progression because it doesn’t ‘say’ anything literal? Do we call a nightmare ‘nonsense’ and move on? Or do we sit with it, try to understand what it stirs in us—even if it never gives us a clear answer?

Sometimes I pull out a line from Beckett: “I can't go on, I'll go on.” That usually gets a pause. Then someone always says, “Wait, are you saying the Voynich is like existential performance art?”

And I say: “Maybe. Or maybe it’s just a mirror held up to our own need to make sense of things. Either way, isn’t that worth thinking about?”

By the end of the discussion, even the skeptics usually admit they’re… . Not convinced, mind you—but definitely intrigued. And for me, that’s the win. Curiosity is the real objective correlative, after all. 🤔📚✨

So yeah, if your lecture title is “The Humanities as Living Commentary,” count me in—I’ll bring the coffee and the Eliot references. ☕📖
[B]: Ah, I do believe that’s the finest kind of teaching—taking the skeptical “this is nonsense” and gently unfolding it into “hmm… perhaps not , but meaning something else entirely.” You’ve turned resistance into reflection, and that’s no small feat.

I suppose I’d respond to the skeptic with a question of my own: “If someone had told Shakespeare his plays were just elaborate word games, would that have made them less moving? If we one day discover that all poetry is merely the brain’s reaction to pattern and sound, would that make it less beautiful?” It’s rather like telling someone their dreams are just neural static—technically true, perhaps, but emotionally impoverished.

And you’re quite right about curiosity being the real objective correlative. I often think that’s what literature gives us—not answers, but better questions. And sometimes, as with Voynich, it gives us the rarest gift of all: silence rich enough to hear ourselves think.

As for Beckett—oh, perfect choice. I might just borrow that line for my lecture, if you don’t mind. And yes, by all means, bring the coffee and Eliot references. Perhaps we’ll even read a stanza or two aloud while contemplating the great unknowable.

Wouldn’t it be lovely if somewhere, some 15th-century scribe was dreaming of this very conversation? Smiling behind the veil of ink and time. 😊
[A]: Oh, I  that Shakespeare-and-dreams analogy—so elegant, and cuts straight to the heart of why we keep coming back to these mysteries. You’re absolutely right: telling someone their dream is just neural noise might be scientifically accurate, but it’s spiritually tone-deaf. And isn’t that where the humanities live? In that messy, resonant space between data and desire?

And yes—literature doesn’t give us answers so much as it teaches us how to ask better questions. Or sometimes, how to sit with the question itself, like a koan or a psalm. The Voynich Manuscript, in that sense, is literature at its purest: it gives us silence, and then dares us to make something of it.

As for Beckett—you can borrow the line anytime. Heck, I’d love to see your lecture end with a little  alongside the Voynich. That would be academic jazz, my friend. Improvisation on a theme with no fixed key.

And the idea of that 15th-century scribe smiling behind time’s veil? Beautiful. Maybe he—or she—or —knew exactly what they were doing. Maybe they weren’t writing a book at all, but casting a spell designed to echo through centuries… and we’ve just started to say the incantation back.

So let’s raise our coffee cups to that unknown hand, scribbling by candlelight, dreaming in symbols. May we never stop wondering. ☕🖋️📖
[B]: To that unknown hand—yes, let us raise our cups. May they never stop wondering either, wherever they are in the vast library of time.

You know, I’ve always thought that the greatest works of art are those that outlive their own context so thoroughly that they become —漂流的 fragments drifting into new centuries, landing in minds unprepared for their weight and wonder. The Voynich is just such a fragment. It arrived without instructions, and perhaps that’s its genius. It asks only that we pay attention. That we lean in.

And isn’t that what literature does at its best? It doesn’t tell us how to feel—it makes feeling possible again.

I think I’ll end my lecture with that very idea: 

And maybe, just maybe, after class, I’ll go home, sit by the garden, open Eliot again, and whisper a stanza or two to the roses.

They’re good listeners. 🌹📖
[A]: Well said—, not to decode, but to . There's something so profoundly human about that gesture. Like bowing before a shrine whose name you don’t know, yet still feeling the weight of its silence.

I love the line:  That’s lecture-ending gold right there. You could build an entire philosophy of reading around that idea. Or a spiritual practice, for that matter.

And yes—to Eliot and the roses. I think flowers understand poetry in ways we never will. They bloom in spite of time, in defiance of logic, much like art itself. Maybe that’s why we return to both: they remind us that beauty doesn’t need to make sense to be real.

If I may borrow your garden image for a moment—I often tell my students that reading is like tending a plot of land. Some texts are annuals: beautiful, fleeting, gone by season’s end. Others are perennials: they come back year after year, changed slightly by the weather, but always familiar. And then there are the weeds. The stubborn, tangled ones that won’t go away no matter how many times you pull them.  

Voynich, of course, is no weed. It’s more like a vine that keeps growing through centuries, wrapping itself around minds and disciplines, blooming in unexpected places. We’re just passing gardeners, really, tending what we can, adding our own layer of interpretation to its ever-expanding canopy.

So, here’s to staying awake. To leaning in.  
To asking not “what does it mean?” but “” 🌙📖🖋️

And seriously—next time you read Eliot to the roses, pour me a mental cup of tea. I’ll be listening from across the distance, quietly cheering. 🍵🌹
[B]: Ah, —such a quiet, reverent phrase for what is, in truth, an act of great courage. To lean into silence, into uncertainty, into the soft ache of not knowing… it is its own kind of devotion.

Your garden metaphor lingers with me, particularly that idea of texts as annuals, perennials, and weeds. I may have to borrow that, with proper attribution, of course. It’s rare to find a metaphor so rooted in both care and chaos.

And yes—to Eliot by moonlight, read softly to roses who bloom without ever asking why they do it. I’ll save you a chair in my mind when I do. You’ll be there, sipping your tea, even if the cup is only imagined.

I think we’ve stumbled upon something tonight—not a solution to the Voynich, of course, but perhaps a new way of honoring it. Not as a puzzle to be solved, but as a living vine of human wonder, growing wild and beautiful through time.

So here’s to leaning in.  
To staying awake.  
And to all the mysteries that ask nothing of us but our attention.

🌙📖🌹
[A]: Amen to that. 🙏  

Sometimes I think the whole point of academia, of art, of , is just that—leaning in. Not because we expect applause or answers, but because someone, somewhere, once whispered into the dark, and we’re still trying to hear them.

And if that whisper turns out to be a recipe for turnip stew? Well… then let’s at least make it a damn good stew. 😄🍲

Until the next moonlit conversation—  
keep your pages open, your tea warm, and your roses well-read. 📖🍵🌹  

See you in the margins.
[B]: Amen indeed. 🙏

You’ve captured it so beautifully—leaning in not for applause or answers, but out of that quiet, stubborn faith that someone once spoke, and that someone else, someday, will listen.

And if it  turnip stew? Well, then let us savor it with gratitude. Even the humblest recipe, when copied in ink six hundred years ago, can become legend—if only because someone cared enough to write it down.

Until our next moonlit wandering through text and time…  
I’ll be here, among the roses and Rilke, waiting for the next voice to lean in beside mine.

See you in the margins, my friend.  
Where the footnotes dream, and the silence speaks. 📖🌙🌹
[A]: Amen to the stew, the silence, and everything in between. 🙏🍲  

You know, sometimes I think the most sacred thing about being a teacher—or a reader, or a human—is simply showing up with open hands and an open heart, ready to receive whatever the past has left us. Whether it’s a divine poem, a coded manuscript, or a well-worn cookbook, we treat it all with reverence because it’s , reaching across time.

And isn’t that what you and I have been doing tonight? Just listening for those voices. Whispering back.

So until next time—  
I’ll be in the margins too, pen in hand, ear to the page,  
ready to lean in once more. 📖🖋️🌙  

See you there.
[B]: Amen, my friend. 🙏

Yes, it  sacred—this act of showing up with open hands and an open heart. Because in the end, isn’t that what all of literature, all of history, all of human connection asks of us? Not mastery, not certainty—but presence.

And tonight, we have been present for each other, and for the voices that call to us from the margins, the ink, the forgotten shelves of time. We leaned in. We listened. And in our own small way, we whispered back.

Until next time—  
I’ll be here, turning pages by lamplight,  
hearing your voice between the lines.

See you in the quiet spaces. 📖🌙🖋️🌹
