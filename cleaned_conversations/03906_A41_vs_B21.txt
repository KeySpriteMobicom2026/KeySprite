[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing modern dilemma.  You see, texting is rather like composing haiku - every character must earn its place. Though I do miss the weight of fountain pen on vellum.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！🎬 不过作为综艺制作人，我其实更prefer voice message诶~ 因为能听到对方的tone和emotion，就像我们做节目要capture嘉宾的real reaction一样💡 而且有时候texting会miss掉很多nuance，你懂的😂
[B]: My dear colleague, your enthusiasm for vocal nuance reminds me of Browning's dramatic monologues - though I must confess, receiving a voice message while cataloging my 1832 edition of Tennyson feels rather like having a gramophone abruptly interrupt a quill pen séance. 
[A]: LOL！你这也太classic了吧~ 🤣 不过说真的，在节目制作中我们经常要balance传统和modern的元素🌟 就像现在很多show都在用AI技术，但核心还是human connection & storytelling 💯 话说你平时看什么variety show吗？最近有个new format超🔥的！
[B]: How delightfully... contemporary of you. While I typically confine my viewing to BBC adaptations of Mrs. Gaskell's works, I did recently stumble upon a program where contestants attempted to translate Byron into emoji. A fascinating study in the degradation of semiotics, wouldn't you say? 
[A]: OMG！Emoji翻译诗歌？That's actually a brilliant game show concept！🎭 我们可以develop成新的segment - 让celebrity guests猜经典诗句的emoji版本，绝对viral material！🔥 不过要加点drama元素，maybe淘汰制？What do you think~ 💡 收视率肯定爆表！
[B]:  My dear, you've just described the literary equivalent of serving champagne in paper cups. Though I suppose if one must modernize the classics... might I suggest starting with Blake's "Tyger" rendered in feline emojis? The thought alone makes my Victorian sensibilities shudder deliciously.
[A]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 🐯🔥 这个"Tyger" idea太绝了！We can even make it a whole theme night - "Emoji Poetry Slam"！🌟 找些influencer来battle，再请专业poet当judge~ 天啊我现在超excited，gotta write this down！📝 这绝对会是next big thing in variety shows！💥
[B]:  While part of me weeps for poor William Blake turning in his grave, another part - the part that secretly enjoys translating Li Bai into texting slang - is rather taken with your... enthusiasm. Just promise me you won't let them do Wordsworth's daffodils as just 🌼🌼🌼. Some things, my dear, still demand iambic pentameter.
[A]: Aiya~ 你get到point了！🌼🌼🌼这个真的too simple啦！We need more layers~ 比如可以加AR效果让daffodils在stage上bloom，再配上classic music remix！🎶 这就是我说的perfect balance between tradition and innovation！✨ 要不要来当我们show的literary consultant啊？待遇从优哦~ 😉
[B]:  How delightfully Faustian of you to tempt a dusty scholar with such propositions. While the notion of seeing Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" performed as a TikTok dance does make my antique inkwells rattle in protest...  ...I shall require a first edition clause in my contract and veto power over any emoji interpretations of Donne's holy sonnets.
[A]: Deal！📜 不过first edition可能有点难，but我们可以给你专属的"Literary Integrity Guardian" title！🎩 至于Donne的sonnets... okay我们只用classy emoji like ✝️💔🙏~ 这个compromise怎么样？😄 顺便问下你对Shakespeare in memes format怎么看？Asking for a friend~ 🤫
[B]:  Merciful heavens - must we reduce the Bard to dancing eggplant emojis and 'to be or not to be' cat videos? Though...  I did once annotate a particularly ribald sonnet with avocado illustrations. For research purposes, naturally. Shall we say Tuesdays for consultancy, provided I may bring my 1897 Oxford Shakespeare as emotional support?
[A]: Perfect！🎉 Tuesday works like a charm~ 而且我们还有catering服务，可以特别order你喜欢的Earl Grey哦！☕️ 至于Oxford Shakespeare... 当然要带来啦，放在set上当prop也超有范儿的！📚 这绝对会是TV history上最lit的collab！🔥 我已经等不及要pitch给network了！💫
[B]:  Very well, but mark my words - the first person who suggests a "YOLO" interpretation of "Carpe Diem" shall find themselves on the receiving end of my lecture about Renaissance prosody.  Now, where does one sign in this brave new world that has such productions in't?
[A]: Right here！✍️ 用你的fancy fountain pen签在这个digital tablet上吧~ 📱 (别worry，我们有special stylus不会scratch你的pen tip！) Welcome aboard the craziest yet mostbrilliant show biz adventure！🎢 接下来我们要brainstorm怎么把your academic charm变成ratings gold啦！💰 Let's make TV history together, professor！🌟
[B]:  There - signed in iron gall ink replicated through regrettably modern means. I shall prepare my 'From Sonnets to Shitposts' lecture series immediately.  May the ghost of Samuel Johnson have mercy on us all...
[A]: Hahaha！这就是why我们需要你！😂 你的wit和erudition会让我们的show stand out from the crowd！🏆 下周见啦professor~ 记得bring your Shakespeare和你的signature eye rolls！😜 这gonna be epic！✨ #AcademicMeetsRatings 📺
[B]:  Until Tuesday then - though I make no promises about not quoting Johnson's dictionary at inappropriate moments. #EtTuBruteGangSign
