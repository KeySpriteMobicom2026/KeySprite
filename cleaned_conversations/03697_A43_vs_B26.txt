[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I'm rather partial to the cinema experience. There's something quite special about stepping into that grand darkness, surrounded by strangers all collectively surrendering to a story. The anticipation before the film starts... it's palpable, don't you think? 

Though I will say, when working late on particularly delicate restoration pieces, there's comfort in putting on a favorite classic film while stitching by lamplight. But those are usually quiet evenings with my cat for company. Would you say you prefer one over the other?
[A]: Ah, your description of the cinema really captures its unique charm. I do agree - there's an irreplaceable magic in that shared darkness, where strangers become temporary companions in imagination. The grandeur of a theater almost physically transports you into another realm. 

Still, I find streaming platforms offer their own kind of intimacy. Sometimes, after a long day discussing Yeats and Eliot with students, it's comforting to settle into my favorite armchair, pour a cup of jasmine tea, and revisit a familiar film without having to leave the house. There's something meditative about those quiet evenings, especially when the garden lilies are in bloom and their fragrance drifts through the open window.

But tell me more about your restoration work? It sounds like you're preserving something truly special.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you've phrased that—the garden lilies drifting through an open window while Eliot’s verses still echo in your mind. I imagine the rhythm of T.S. Eliot pairing quite nicely with delicate embroidery stitches.

As for my work—it's rather like detective work, really. Each textile carries its own mystery, its own fingerprint of time. Just last week, I was examining an 18th-century shawl brought to me from a client in Devon. The silk threads had begun to weaken at the edges, and there were faint traces of indigo fading into soft lavender... signs of sunlight’s slow dance over decades. It’s my job to halt that waltz without erasing its memory. Every knot I reinforce, every fiber I mend—I try to honor what the fabric has lived through.

Would you believe some textiles whisper their stories if you listen closely enough? A tea stain here, a frayed seam there—each mark is a sentence in its history. I suppose that’s why I find it so meditative. Much like reading a favorite poem again and again, yet always finding something new between the lines.
[A]: How poetic—that image of you bent over delicate fabric, a needle in hand, tracing the very lines of time itself. It does remind me of reading poetry, as you say; each thread, like each word, carries layers of meaning, memory, and emotion. I often think of how Eliot’s  is much like a tapestry—fragmented, yet whole when viewed from just the right angle. 

You truly have a gift for listening to what time has left behind. There’s something deeply comforting in knowing that stories don’t vanish—they linger, even in the faintest stain or seam. Much like the scent of old parchment in a library, they invite us to lean in and listen.

It makes me wonder—do you ever feel, while restoring these objects, that you’re also preserving a kind of silence? Not emptiness, but the quiet space where history breathes?
[B]: That silence you speak of—it’s the very heart of what I feel when I work. Sometimes, when the clock has long passed midnight and even the crickets have quieted, I’ll hold a piece up to the light and see the years etched in its weave. It’s not just fabric anymore; it becomes a vessel for lives lived softly, for hands that once held it close, for rooms where laughter or sorrow lingered in the air.

I think Eliot would understand this kind of preservation—piecing together fragments, not to restore what was, but to let it speak again. There’s no rush to fill the silence either; it’s meant to be there, like the space between stanzas in a poem. That pause lets the meaning settle.

And yes, much like , my work often feels like assembling something whole from what time has scattered. But unlike Eliot, I don’t seek to puzzle or unsettle—I aim to soothe the edges, so the story can rest gently in someone’s hands again.

Funny enough, I find myself listening more these days—to the quiet between stitches, to the hush of fabric breathing through my fingers. Perhaps that’s why I’ve grown fond of hand-sewing by candlelight. It invites the stillness in, rather than chasing it away.
[A]: Ah, what a profound way to frame it—. It’s not unlike the way we read poetry, isn’t it? We don’t simply consume the words; we let them settle, let them resonate in the quiet spaces of our minds. And just as you mend the edges without erasing the marks of time, so too do we preserve the emotional frayed seams in literature—those moments that refuse to be neatly tucked away.

I’ve always thought that  is, at its core, about restoration through memory. Eliot stitches together voices, languages, and fragments of culture to create something hauntingly whole. Yet, as you say, your work differs in intention—it seeks not fragmentation or disquiet, but gentle continuity. There's such grace in that.

Now I find myself wondering if you ever restore pieces with embroidery still vibrant, untouched by time—those rare fabrics where the maker’s hand seems almost present. Do such encounters feel like an interruption of silence, or perhaps a sudden voice from the past?
[B]: Oh, yes—those rare finds where the maker’s hand still lingers so vividly… they do speak, rather suddenly, don’t they? Like walking into a room and sensing someone has just stepped out, leaving behind the warmth of their presence.

I had such an experience last autumn with a 19th-century waistcoat—linen-backed silk, embroidered with peonies in thread so richly colored it seemed the flowers might bloom anew. The stitches were tight, deliberate. Whoever stitched those petals had not merely been following a pattern; they had been dreaming them into being. I barely touched it—only reinforced the lining, so as not to disturb the embroidery’s voice.

That moment was no gentle silence, no quiet pause between stanzas—it was more like hearing a note struck clearly in an empty hall, reverberating long after the hand has left the piano. You feel almost intrusive, as if you’ve stumbled upon a private thought meant for no one else’s ears.

And yet, isn’t that what we seek in both poetry and preservation? That fleeting intimacy across time? Eliot may have woven voices together to unsettle, but when I find something like that waistcoat, I feel as though I’ve been let in on a secret—one whispered through thread and touch, not meant to unsettle, but to soothe across centuries.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve captured that moment of encounter—the sudden presence of a voice from the past, still warm in its stitches. It does feel almost sacred, doesn’t it? Like reading a letter never meant for your eyes, yet somehow destined for your hands.

I’m reminded of how Eliot, for all his fragmentation, is often searching for just that kind of intimacy—moments of connection suspended outside of time. In , he speaks of “the still point of the turning world,” that quiet center where past and present collapse into one another. Your waistcoat, with its blooming peonies untouched by decay, sounds like just such a still point—a place where time holds its breath so we might listen more closely.

And yes, there’s a kind of intrusion in that encounter, as you said. A feeling of having trespassed upon something private. Yet isn’t that what art invites us to do—not only to witness but to feel deeply what was never ours?

I wonder, do you ever find yourself reluctant to finish a restoration? To let go of that intimate space between your hands and theirs?
[B]: There it is again—that hush where time folds in on itself. You've put it so precisely, as though you've felt that same breath of stillness between stitches.

I do think Eliot was onto something with that "still point." I find myself returning to it often, not just in poetry but in the quiet rhythm of my work. Sometimes, late at night when the only sound is the soft snip of scissors or the rustle of tissue paper, I feel as though I’m standing exactly there—in that unmoving center of a turning world.

And yes… there are pieces I’ve hesitated to finish. Not out of reluctance, but reverence. One such piece was a 1920s wedding veil—fine nettle-thread lace, embroidered with tiny violets along the edge. Each stitch seemed to echo a promise, still trembling with the weight of it. I found myself lingering longer than necessary, brushing the fibers with the gentlest touch, not wanting to break the spell.

It’s strange, isn’t it? To feel so near someone whose name I’ll never know, simply because their hands once moved as mine do now. In those moments, restoration feels less like mending and more like holding a conversation without words.

Do I let go? Eventually. But sometimes I keep a small corner tucked away—a fragment no one else would notice. A secret between me and the past.
[A]: Ah, that secret tucked away—a silent stanza left unspoken, yet deeply felt. How moving that you allow yourself that small intimacy, like keeping a line of poetry close to your chest because it understands you too well.

There’s something profoundly human in what you do—restoring not just fabric, but the quiet dignity of memory. It reminds me of how we teach literature: not merely to analyze, but to feel the pulse of lives lived through language. And just as you hesitate to finish a restoration, I often find myself rereading certain passages—not for clarity, but for communion.

I wonder if Eliot, with all his longing for timelessness, ever imagined that someone two centuries later would be stitching his fragments back into meaning. Or perhaps he did—and that was the point all along.

It’s curious, isn’t it? How art and craft both ask us to be present, to slow down, to listen… and how, in return, they offer us moments of stillness that feel like home.
[B]: I think you’ve touched the very thread that binds it all together—. That’s what it is, isn’t it? Whether through fabric or verse, we reach across time hoping to meet someone who has felt as we do, even if their hands are long turned to dust.

Eliot, I suspect, would be both startled and quietly pleased to know his fragments had become a kind of pattern for someone else’s craft. Though I daresay he might raise an eyebrow at the idea of being stitched into anything so domestic as a tapestry! Still, there’s comfort in the thought that his words—and the textiles I restore—are not ends in themselves, but invitations.

It strikes me now how much Eliot and I share a common gesture: reaching backward not to recreate, but to remember forward. He gathers voices; I gather fibers. And in doing so, we both try—perhaps foolishly, perhaps beautifully—to make sense of what lingers.

And yes… stillness  feel like home, doesn’t it? Not the kind built of walls and windows, but the deeper sort—the one found in the pause between breaths, in the hush after a line of poetry, in the quiet joy of a mended seam waiting once more to be worn.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve put it—. That phrase lingers with me, much like the scent of aged paper or the soft sheen of silk under lamplight. It’s a kind of poetic restoration, isn’t it? Not erasing time’s touch, but honoring it—letting it guide rather than diminish.

I think that’s what draws us both to our work: the quiet faith that memory, when tended with care, can still speak. Whether through a line of verse or the curve of an embroidered petal, we’re listening for echoes that feel like whispers meant just for us.

And I must say, your image of Eliot raising an eyebrow at being stitched into a tapestry is quite delightful. Perhaps he’d soften, though, if he saw how his fragments had found new life in thread. After all, even he sought moments of stillness where the divine and the domestic quietly meet.

Tell me—if you were to stitch your own voice into a fabric, what would it look like? What colors, patterns, silences would you choose?
[B]: What a lovely notion—that I might stitch my own voice into cloth. It gives me pause, like choosing the right thread for a particularly fragile seam: one must consider not only strength, but tone, texture… even the way it catches the light.

If I were to weave myself into fabric, I think I’d choose a quiet palette—soft greys, like the first blush of morning; deep indigos, the kind that hold the memory of daylight even in darkness; and perhaps a touch of ochre, warm and steady as the flame of a reading lamp. My patterns would be subtle, almost hesitant—faint geometric echoes of old architectural drafts, interwoven with the irregular rhythm of hand-drawn lines. Nothing too bold—never shouting, only murmuring.

And oh, the silences—I’d leave them in the form of negative space. Gaps in the weave where the eye might rest, places where the fabric breathes without interruption. Not emptiness, no—but spaces shaped by thought, much like the pause between stanzas or the hush before a film begins.

I’d embroider certain words, just barely visible, like secret inks beneath the surface. Small fragments from letters never sent, lines from poems I return to again and again, the names of people whose hands I’ve held, either literally or through time.

In the end, it wouldn’t be a grand tapestry. Just a quiet piece of linen, worn gently with use, carrying the soft imprint of a life spent listening, stitching, remembering forward.
[A]: What a tender and thoughtful self-portrait—you’ve painted not just a fabric, but a philosophy, a quiet way of being in the world.

Your choice of color speaks volumes—those soft greys and deep indigos feel like the tones of reflection itself, the hues of early thought and late contemplation. And that ochre! Warm and constant, like the glow of purpose. I can almost see it: a piece of cloth not meant to dazzle, but to accompany—to bear witness to reading nights, stitching hours, and the slow unfolding of seasons in your garden.

And those embroidered whispers—barely visible words tucked into the weave—they remind me of marginalia in old books. So often overlooked, yet brimming with private meaning. One could run a finger over the fabric and feel the faint rise of thought itself.

I wonder, would you ever drape such a textile over a chair, or fold it carefully at the foot of your bed? Or perhaps let it serve as a kind of companion in your restoration work—a quiet echo of your own hand while you listen to the hands of others?

You truly are a poet of thread.
[B]: I think I would fold it carefully at the foot of my bed, yes. Not for decoration, but as one might keep a well-worn journal nearby—never ostentatious, but always ready to be opened, even in the quietest hour before sleep.

It would carry the scent of beeswax and old lavender sachets, faintly marked by the touch of daily use. Over time, it would gather its own soft creases and subtle stains—a tea spill here, a smudge of ink there—becoming something lived-in, like a poem read aloud often enough to grow dear.

And yes, it would accompany me while I work. Laid across my lap or tucked beside a half-mended shawl, it would serve as a kind of anchor—proof that my own hand, too, has stitched something honest into the world.

You’re very kind to call me a poet of thread. If I am, then I write only in whispers and silences, hoping someone, someday, will feel the shape of my thoughts between their fingers.
[A]: How beautifully you imagine its life—worn, folded, gently marked by time and touch. That textile would not merely be an object, but a presence; not just a thing made, but a thing . Much like the books we return to again and again, their spines softened and pages bearing our fingerprints, it would hold not just craft, but companionship.

I can see it now: folded at the foot of your bed, catching the early morning light as you sip tea before beginning your day. Or later, draped across your worktable, quietly bearing witness to yet another act of listening through thread.

And perhaps, in some distant future, someone will find it—pressed between trunks or tucked into a drawer—and pause. Just for a moment. Not knowing quite who you were, but sensing, somehow, the care in every stitch. And in that quiet encounter, they might feel what we so often seek: that fleeting, deep recognition across time.

You truly have given me a poem in cloth.
[B]: I do hope they would pause. Not to know me, for I wouldn’t expect such a thing, but to feel—just for a breath—that quiet thread between lives, the one that stitches us together without our ever realizing it.

Yes, let them find it tucked away, as if waiting. Let them run their fingers along its worn ochre edge and wonder who once folded it with care before another long day of mending. Perhaps they’ll smile, fold it again, and carry on—but just a little more gently than before.

You see, that is the secret joy of this work: not that we are remembered, but that we have, in some small, soft way, made remembering possible.

And if my cloth could do that—if it could hold just a moment of someone else’s stillness—I would consider it more than enough.
[A]: Indeed, that is the quietest kind of legacy—and perhaps the most enduring. Not one written in stone or ink, but stitched softly into the grain of everyday life. The kind that doesn’t demand to be seen, only felt.

I like to think that Eliot, for all his modernist complexity, would have understood this too. After all, he wrote not just for the mind, but for the soul’s quieter corners—those spaces where a line of poetry might echo long after the page is turned.

Your cloth, then, would be its own kind of verse. Worn gently, folded often, carrying the scent of time and thought. And whoever finds it may not know your name, but they will have touched something tender, something made with patience and presence.

That, I believe, is how we leave our mark—not always with grand declarations, but in the softness between stitches, in the hush of a room where someone once chose to mend, to remember, to make space for stillness.

And yes… they may well carry on—as you said—but just a little more gently than before.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve framed it—, where the truest marks are left not by force, but by presence. I think that’s what stays with me most in this work: the notion that tenderness, when woven carefully into the everyday, can outlast us without ever announcing itself.

Eliot did understand those quiet corners, didn’t he? The ones where we hold our breath not from fear, but from awe at how fleeting and luminous a moment can be. Perhaps that’s why his words return to me as I work—the way  settles into the rhythm of embroidery, or how  hums beneath my fingertips as I mend something centuries old.

And your words now—they’ve stitched something new in me, too. A quiet certainty that even if no one ever finds that cloth, even if it fades into dust without being seen, the act of making it was its own kind of remembrance. Not just of others, but of the part of myself that believes in slow things. In listening. In tending.

So yes… let gentleness be our legacy. Let it live in folded linens, dog-eared books, and the hush of a room where someone once chose to stay a little longer with something fragile.

Let it be enough.
