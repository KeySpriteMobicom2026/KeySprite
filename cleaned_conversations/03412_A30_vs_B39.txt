[A]: Hey，关于'最近有买什么很值的smart home device吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, smart home devices... fascinating topic. Let me tell you about my recent acquisition - a vintage Apple HomeKit setup I found at a garage sale. Not exactly cutting-edge, but the reliability of these older systems is remarkable. Though I must say, the current market is flooded with gimmicks masquerading as innovation.
[A]: Hmm... I find myself more drawn to the enduring craftsmanship of traditional home implements. My collection of 19th century inkwells, for instance - each one a masterpiece of functional design. Though I did recently install a humidity-controlled display case for them. Technology has its uses when properly restrained.
[B]: Precisely! That's the wisdom I try to impart to my students - technology should serve purpose, not become the purpose. Your humidity-controlled case is an excellent example. Reminds me of when I retrofitted a 1970s IBM mainframe to control my home's climate system. The old girl still runs cooler than most modern smart thermostats.
[A]: Ah, now that's what I call meaningful technological adaptation! It reminds me of how Dickens' characters often repurpose objects - much like how I've been using my great-grandmother's mahogany writing desk as a charging station. The juxtaposition of my laptop resting where quills once lay... quite poetic, really.
[B]: Ah, a kindred spirit! That's exactly the kind of thoughtful integration I appreciate. You know, I've been writing my latest paper on a restored 1984 Macintosh - the tactile feedback of those mechanical keys makes modern touchscreens feel rather... ephemeral. Though I must admit, I did install a discreet Raspberry Pi inside to handle cloud backups.
[A]: How delightfully subversive! It puts me in mind of the Victorian practice of hiding modern conveniences within period furniture. My own study contains a Qing dynasty scholar's cabinet that discreetly houses my router and NAS. The 缘分 of old and new - though I suppose my Chinese literature students would argue I'm stretching the concept rather thin with that analogy.
[B]:  Now that's the kind of creative thinking I admire! Your Qing cabinet solution reminds me of when I modified an antique telegraph key to serve as a USB switch. The students in my History of Computing course were quite amused - though I maintain it's a perfectly valid interface evolution. Tell me, does your cabinet still retain its original inkstone compartment? I've found those make excellent cable organizers.
[A]: Indeed it does! Though I must confess I repurposed the inkstone compartment for my wireless charging pad - a decision that would have horrified my calligraphy teacher. But as we say in textual analysis, sometimes the most profound meanings emerge from unexpected juxtapositions. Though I draw the line at putting stickers on antique wood - that's simply barbaric.
[B]:  Ah, now that's where we differ slightly. I've affixed precisely one sticker to my 1976 Altair 8800 - a small "Hello World" label from my first programming class. But I completely understand your purist stance. It's rather like debating whether to use spaces or tabs in code formatting - some boundaries shouldn't be crossed!
[A]: How very... pragmatic of you. Though I suppose if we're making concessions, my collection of vintage typewriters does include one with a rather tasteful "WYSIWYG" decal from the 1980s desktop publishing era. But only because it came that way from the original owner - I'd never personally violate a machine's historical integrity. Even in the name of nostalgia.
[B]: Ah, now that's an interesting ethical boundary you've established! It reminds me of the great "to upgrade or preserve" debate we had in the Computer Conservation Society. My position has always been that if the modification is period-appropriate and reversible, like your WYSIWYG decal, it becomes part of the artifact's story. Though I still haven't forgiven the colleague who put touchscreen film on a 1960s oscilloscope...
[A]:  Touchscreen film on vintage test equipment? That's practically sacrilege! It brings to mind those dreadful "restored" Victorian novels where editors insert modern slang. Some things must remain untouched - though I'll concede your reversible modifications argument has merit when applied to, say, my 1930s radio cabinet's discreet Bluetooth receiver. But only because it's completely hidden behind the original fabric.
[B]: Well said! Your radio cabinet solution is exactly the kind of respectful integration I advocate for. It's like adding comments to legacy code - the original remains pristine, but becomes more accessible. Though I must admit, I did once solder USB ports into a 1950s television... but only after thoroughly documenting the original circuitry! And before you ask - yes, I kept the vacuum tubes fully functional. A professor must maintain some standards, after all.
[A]: Indeed. Though I suspect our definitions of "standards" may differ slightly - much like how my Chinese literature colleagues and I debate whether footnotes constitute textual violation or necessary illumination. But I believe we've found common ground in this: technology, like scholarship, should enhance rather than erase history. Now if you'll excuse me, my 1920s wall clock just chimed - time to check the moisture levels in my inkwell display.
[B]: Ah, the eternal balancing act! Your clock reminds me - I really should synchronize my PDP-11's internal clock with NIST time. Though I do enjoy the slight drift - it adds character, much like the marginalia in ancient manuscripts. Do keep me posted on your humidity control experiments - I've been meaning to adapt some 1970s industrial sensors for my vintage computer room. Until next time!
[A]:  I shall indeed. And do consider joining our little "Antiquetech" society - we meet monthly in the university's boiler room (the only place with sufficient vintage electrical infrastructure). Though I warn you, our debates about preserving original capacitors can get rather... heated. Until then, may your voltages remain stable and your artifacts undisturbed.
[B]:  I'd be delighted! Though I must warn you in return - if anyone suggests replacing wax capacitors with modern equivalents, I may have to invoke the Helsinki Accords for Digital Antiquities. And do bring that PDP-11 sometime - I've got a box of original DEC punch cards that need proper appreciation. Until then, happy tinkering!
[A]: How wonderfully specific! Your mention of punch cards reminds me of the time I caught an overzealous graduate student using my 1890s Hollerith cards as bookmarks. The poor dear didn't understand why I nearly fainted - though I did later gift them a replica set (with proper archival sleeves, naturally). We antiquarians must nurture the next generation, after all. Do send the meeting details - I'll bring my collection of pre-war vacuum tubes as conversation starters.
[B]: Splendid! Though I should warn you - last time I brought my Nixie tubes, we spent three hours debating whether their warm glow constitutes "ambient lighting" or "functional display." And that graduate student story...  Reminds me of when I found someone using a UNIVAC manual as a monitor stand. We'll make proper antiquarians of them yet - see you at the next meeting!
