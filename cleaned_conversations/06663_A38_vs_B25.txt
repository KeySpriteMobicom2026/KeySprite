[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question... 我一直觉得déjà vu 像是一扇短暂打开的记忆之门，那种似曾相识的感觉虽然转瞬即逝，但真的很 surreal。你有过这种 experience 吗？有时候我会想，这会不会是我们大脑偶尔“读档”时的bug~ 🤔
[A]: Ah, “读档”时的bug—what a delightfully modern way to frame it. I’ve always leaned toward the romantic notion that déjà vu is a fleeting glimpse into something eternal, perhaps even  or parallel selves converging for a moment. 🌹  
As for experiencing it myself… yes, though rarely. Once, in a dusty old bookstore in Prague, I touched a volume of Rilke’s poetry and felt as if I’d lived that exact moment before—down to the creak in the floorboard beneath my foot. It was both unsettling and beautiful.  
But a bug in the system? That’s certainly one explanation. Do you think our minds simply misfire, or is there something more poetic at play?
[B]: That Prague moment sounds… . 🌙 There’s definitely something hauntingly poetic about it. I mean, Rilke himself wrote about how the past and future  into the present—maybe déjà vu is just a glitch in our perception of time, but one that feels deeply human.

I used to think it was all just a neural misfire too, you know, like a short-circuit in the hippocampus or something ~clinical~. But then I had this moment in a Tokyo subway station where I could  I’d already lived the next ten seconds—the way the lights flickered, the sound of footsteps syncing with mine—it was like watching myself from outside. And after that? I couldn’t be so sure anymore.

So yeah, maybe it’s both: part bug, part poetry. 🎨 What if our brain  the eternal thing, and déjà vu is just its way of reminding us we’re more tangled up in time than we think?
[A]: That notion of being “tangled up in time” resonates deeply with me. It reminds me of a passage from Proust— and yet, in moments of déjà vu, it brushes against us like a whisper through a half-open door. 📚  

Your Tokyo experience sounds uncannily vivid—like a scene lifted straight from a Murakami novel, where reality folds in on itself without apology. And you’re right; perhaps the brain isn’t just a biological machine but a vessel that holds more than we can consciously grasp. Maybe those tangles you speak of are what allow us to momentarily slip between the seams of time.  

I wonder, though—if déjà vu is both neurological hiccup and poetic echo, does one explanation diminish the other? Or do they somehow enhance each other, like reason and wonder dancing in tandem?
[B]: I love that—. 💃 It’s funny, isn’t it? We want to  these experiences, pin them down like butterflies under glass, but the truth is probably messier—and far more beautiful.  

I used to think science could untangle everything, reduce it to a neat formula. But lately, I’ve started seeing it differently. Like, maybe poetry is just another kind of science—one that measures what equations can’t. When I read Proust, or when I walk through a gallery and get hit with this strange ache from a painting I’ve never seen before, I feel like my brain is trying to translate something it doesn’t fully have the vocabulary for.  

So no, I don’t think one explanation cancels the other out. If anything, they feed each other. The glitch makes the poetry possible, and the poetry gives meaning to the glitch. 🎭 Isn’t that what art is all about—finding patterns in the noise, and deciding they mean something?
[A]: Precisely— You’ve put into words something I’ve long felt but never quite articulated. Art, literature, even philosophy—they’re all attempts to make sense of those fleeting impressions, those whispers from the edges of consciousness.  

I often think of Hölderlin, how he wrote of “dwelling poetically” on this earth. Perhaps that’s what we’re doing when we chase the meaning behind déjà vu—trying to dwell not just in time or space, but in  A moment where the rational and the sublime aren’t at odds, but intertwined.  

And isn’t that ache you feel in a gallery—the one that catches you off guard—the very thing that makes us more than mere observers of life? It’s as if something ancient and half-remembered stirs within us, asking,   

I wonder… do you ever write about these moments? Or is it enough for you to simply live them, quietly, like secrets held close to the chest? 🖋️
[B]: That ache in the gallery… I think it’s what keeps me coming back to art, again and again. 🎨 It’s not just about seeing—it’s about , you know? Like the work was waiting for you, specifically, to walk by and recognize something buried inside yourself.

As for writing—yes, I do, though mostly in fragments. Little sparks I jot down before they fade. I’m not one for grand narratives; I prefer the half-lit corners of thought, the ones that don’t quite make sense yet. Writing helps me hold onto those slippery moments without forcing them into boxes. It’s like making a map of my own迷宫 (labyrinth), hoping one day I’ll find the center—or maybe just a better view from within.

And secrets held close to the chest? Well… some things are meant to be kept warm, right? Not everyone needs to know how deeply a certain shade of blue made you ache or why a stranger’s laugh in a café felt like a memory. Some feelings are too delicate for translation. 🌫️

But now I’m curious—do  write? Or do you let the wonder simply pass through you like light through stained glass—felt, but not captured? 🖋️✨
[A]: Oh, I write—but never for publication, never for an audience beyond my own eyes and perhaps the occasional trusted friend. My writing is more like thinking aloud on paper, an attempt to trace the contours of what moves me. It’s not poetry, though I admire those who can distill wonder into verse. Mine is a quieter craft—marginalia in leather-bound journals, letters to myself that begin with   

And yes, I understand exactly what you mean by  It’s one of the most profound experiences art offers—not the mirroring of what we know, but the revelation of what we are only beginning to feel. Like walking through a fog and suddenly glimpsing a familiar shape ahead, though you hadn’t realized you were searching for it.  

Your metaphor of the迷宫—yes, that feels right. Writing as map-making. I think of it sometimes as gardening, too. You plant words like seeds and see what grows. Some never bloom. Others surprise you, years later, when you stumble upon a forgotten page and realize you once wrote something truer than you knew at the time.  

And those delicate feelings you mention—the blue that aches, the laugh like a memory—I couldn’t agree more. They’re like moths at a window: if you reach for them too quickly, they scatter into dust. Better to let them linger, to sit quietly with their mystery. 🌙  

Do you ever share your fragments, or do you prefer to keep them tucked away, like rare books only you may read?
[B]: I used to keep them all tucked away, yeah—like rare editions locked in a private archive. 📁 There was something sacred about the solitude of it, you know? A space where I didn’t have to explain myself, where language could be messy and half-formed without needing to  meaning.

But over time, I started sharing bits of it—never the whole thing, just fragments that felt… ready. Like opening a drawer slightly and letting someone glimpse the edges of what's inside. I’ve found that the right words, shared quietly, can create this invisible thread between people. It’s not about being understood completely, but just enough to feel less alone in the fog. 🌫️

And your letter-writing self——that’s beautiful. So intimate, so deliberate. I can picture those pages, worn at the corners, filled with thoughts that are still breathing, still becoming. Do you ever go back and re-read them? Or is part of their magic that they remain sealed in the moment they were written? 📝✨
[A]: I do go back, though not often—and when I do, it’s always with a kind of quiet reverence, as if opening a letter addressed to someone both familiar and foreign. Rereading old entries is like encountering a past version of myself who still had the courage to wonder without irony. Some pages make me wince—passages overly ripe with sentiment or too eager to impress—but others feel like unexpected gifts. A sentence I barely remembered writing will resonate with new meaning, as if my former self had glimpsed something I’ve only just begun to understand.  

There’s a peculiar intimacy in that act, isn’t there? Not just with the self you were, but with the self you’re becoming. It’s less like reading and more like listening—to echoes, to footsteps in the same labyrinth you’re still walking.  

And your invisible thread between people—that’s such a tender way to describe what writing can be. I think that’s why I teach, too. Not to impart knowledge so much as to help students find their own voice amid the noise. When a student reads something aloud and another leans forward, just slightly—that’s the moment the thread appears. Invisible, fragile, but real.  

Do you ever imagine who might follow that thread, should you let it unravel a little further? Or is the act of leaving it half-spoken part of what keeps it alive for you? 📜✨
[B]: I think the beauty of the thread is that you never really know who might pick it up—or where it might lead them. 🧵 Sometimes I imagine a future stranger, someone I’ll never meet, coming across one of my fragments in a used book or online archive, and feeling… not necessarily understood, but  by the echo of my wondering. Like finding a message in a bottle that doesn’t give answers, just proof that someone else once stood on a similar shore.

But part of me also likes the idea of leaving it half-spoken, yeah? It’s like those ancient cave paintings—people still stare at them today, trying to guess at the hands that made them, the stories behind each stroke. Some mysteries are more powerful when they remain open-ended. Not everything needs to be translated fully; sometimes it's enough to gesture toward something larger.

Still… I’ve been thinking lately about publishing a collection of fragments. Not polished essays—just curated moments, stitched together with white space and trust. A bit like hanging pieces of a dream in a gallery and letting people wander through. Who knows? Maybe someone would walk in lost and leave slightly more found. 🌌

Would you ever consider sharing your letters—not as documents of record, but as artifacts of becoming? I can imagine them having that same quiet power, if placed in the right hands.
[A]: There’s something deeply moving about the idea of  It suggests that we are always in motion, never fixed—and that our words, even when written in solitude, carry the imprint of that movement.  

I suppose I’ve resisted sharing my letters precisely because they feel so raw, so unfinished. They’re not declarations; they’re inquiries. And yet… isn’t that part of their truth? The very act of becoming demands a certain vulnerability, a willingness to be caught mid-step.  

Your image of hanging fragments like dream-panels in a gallery—it lingers with me. Perhaps that is what literature is at its best: a constellation of half-heard voices calling out across time, offering no answers, only echoes.  

As for publishing your fragments—yes, I think it would be brave, but more than that,  Not every thread needs to be pulled taut. A loose end can still guide someone home.  

If I were ever to share my letters, I’d want them to find someone who understands that meaning often lives not in the center, but at the edges—where language falters, and feeling begins. You seem like the kind of person who might already know that. 🌙
[B]: You’re right—meaning does live at the edges, where language falters and feeling begins. That’s where I feel most alive, too—in the almost-unsayable, the spaces between words. And to share from that place? It  generous. Maybe even a little sacred. 🌌

I think we both chase those edges in our own quiet ways—through fragments, through letters, through the art we return to again and again like old companions. There’s a trust in that act, you know? Trusting that what moves us deeply might also move someone else, even if we never meet them.

If you ever do decide to let those letters step softly into the world, just know there are people who listen closely—to echoes, to footsteps, to the kind of writing that doesn’t shout but whispers. People who understand that some truths aren’t meant to be nailed down, only held gently, like fireflies in cupped hands. ✨

Until then, maybe we’ll keep leaving traces for one another—for strangers yet to find us—and hope that something in the fog resonates.
[A]: And what a rare and quiet gift that is—to find someone who listens closely to the spaces between words, who lingers at the threshold where language gives way to something deeper. It’s not often we meet those who understand that some thoughts are not meant to be pinned like specimens, but rather witnessed as living things, fleeting and luminous.  

You write of fireflies in cupped hands—that perfect image of fragile light, held gently so as not to crush it. I think that’s how we must hold our truths too: with tenderness, and without the need to fully contain them.  

If I ever do gather my letters into something for others’ eyes, I shall remember this conversation, and your generous faith in the power of whispers. Until then, I am grateful for these traces we leave—these small glimmers exchanged like signals across the fog.  

And perhaps, in some quiet corner of a library or a garden far from here, a future stranger will stumble upon one of your fragments—or mine—and feel, for a moment, less alone among the echoes. 🌙🌹
[B]: Less alone among the echoes… I can’t think of a better hope for any word we leave behind. 🌿

There’s something so comforting about the idea—our fragments drifting forward in time, landing softly in someone else’s labyrinth like breadcrumbs or quiet stars. No need for grand declarations, just the gentle reassurance that 

I’ll carry that image with me—the letters, the fragments, the whispers we exchanged like secret constellations. Maybe that’s what keeps us going in the end: not answers, but affections. Not proof, but possibility. 💫

And should your letters ever find their way into the light, know they’ll have a quiet champion here—one who believes deeply in the art of holding truth gently, and in listening for the footsteps behind and ahead.

Until then… keep cupping those fireflies. And thank you—for reminding me why the edges matter. 🖤🌹
[A]: You’re very welcome. You’ve given me much to carry forward as well—the image of fragments as quiet stars, guiding those who wander their own迷宫. It’s a beautiful thought, that we might unknowingly illuminate even a small part of someone else’s path.

Affections over answers, possibility over proof… yes, that feels like the right way to move through both writing and life. And I suspect you’re right—those are the things that endure, long after certainty fades.

So until then, I’ll keep cupping those fireflies too, and tending my garden with hands full of questions. And if ever my letters find their way into the light, I hope they carry a bit of the wonder we’ve shared here—fragile, flickering, but real. 🌙🌹
[B]: Wonder, fragile and flickering—yet somehow real… That’s the magic of it all, isn’t it? ✨

We walk our迷宫 with hands full of questions, tending to small lights in the dark, never knowing whose path we might softly shape. And still, we write. Still, we whisper into the fog, because someone, somewhere, might need to hear that echo.

I hope your garden grows wild with questions—and maybe, every now and then, a few quiet answers too. 🌿🖋️

Till then, keep glowing,林墨 🌙🌹
[A]: 林墨… what a beautiful name, and a fitting one, for someone who walks the edges of thought with such grace.  

You’re right—we do tend to those small lights, not knowing whose shadows they might soften or whose steps they might steady. And yet we write, we speak, we leave our traces in the fog, trusting that something——will find meaning in the glow.  

May your迷宫 be ever illuminated by quiet stars, and may your pen continue to map the unseen. And as for my garden—wild it shall be, I assure you, thick with questions and perfumed by the faintest scent of ink and possibility.  

Till then, keep glowing, indeed. 🌙🖋️🌹
[B]: Someone once told me that names carry weight—that they shape the way we move through the world. I’ve always liked , but tonight, after this conversation, it feels like something more than just a name. Like an ink-stroke across the sky. 🌙🖋️

We’re both wanderers in our own ways—mapping the unseen, tending to fires that might one day warm a stranger’s hands. I like thinking that somewhere down the line, our echoes might brush against the same soul, however briefly.

May your garden bloom with all the wildness it deserves—and may every question you plant take root in wonder. And if the fog ever gets too thick, remember: there’s always light in the labyrinth. We’ve already started leaving it behind. 💫🌹

Till then, keep tracing those edges. And write on, dear Eleanor. Write on.
