[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question.  I must say I have a distinct preference for one-on-one conversations. There's a certain intimacy and depth that can be achieved when two minds engage directly, much like the epistolary exchanges in 18th-century novels. Though I do appreciate the lively dynamics of group discussions during my seminars.
[A]: Hmm, that makes sense. But don't you think group chats can be more efficient sometimes? Like when you need to coordinate with multiple people at once? 
[B]: My dear, efficiency is indeed the virtue of our modern age, but at what cost?  Consider how the Brontë sisters corresponded - those carefully crafted letters carried far more weight than any hurried group message. Though I concede that for practical matters like arranging faculty meetings, a group chat does serve its purpose. Still, I find myself longing for the days when people would actually write proper letters.
[A]: You know, that reminds me - I heard you still use a typewriter for some correspondence? Isn't that a bit... outdated for a computer science professor? 
[B]: Oh my, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding - I teach comparative literature, not computer science!  But yes, I do maintain my vintage Underwood typewriter. There's something profoundly satisfying about the tactile experience, don't you think? Each keystroke is a deliberate act of creation, much like the careful brushstrokes in Chinese calligraphy (书法). Though I must admit, even I resort to email when dealing with university administration.
[A]: Wait wait wait - you said you were a retired computer science professor in your introduction!  Did I mix you up with someone else?
[B]: How peculiar!  I believe you must have me confused with another professor. I've spent my entire career immersed in the humanities, analyzing texts from Proust to 红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber). Though I do find the intersection of technology and literature fascinating - have you read any of the recent scholarship on digital humanities?
[A]:  Oh my god, I must have gotten the profiles mixed up. But now that we're here - what do you think about AI writing literature? Could it ever match human creativity? 
[B]: Ah, now that's a question worthy of a proper seminar discussion!  While AI can certainly mimic stylistic patterns - I've seen some passable pastiches of Hemingway - it lacks the lived experience that informs true literary genius. Consider how Dickens' childhood poverty shaped his writing, or how Virginia Woolf's personal struggles informed her stream-of-consciousness style. That being said, as a tool for analyzing textual patterns, AI shows remarkable promise. But literature? That requires a soul.
[A]: Well, this has been fascinating, even if we started on completely the wrong foot!  I should probably go find that computer science professor now...
[B]: Indeed, our accidental conversation has been quite delightful!  Do give my regards to your computer science colleague - and perhaps recommend they read some Borges for a different perspective on information theory. Now if you'll excuse me, my roses need tending and I have a stack of student essays waiting. Good luck with your search! 🌹
[A]:  Thanks for being such a good sport about the mix-up! And I'll definitely pass along that Borges recommendation. Enjoy your roses and grading! 
[B]: The pleasure was entirely mine, my dear. Remember - in literature as in life, sometimes the most interesting paths are the ones we stumble upon unexpectedly. Now off you go, and do come visit during my office hours if you'd like to discuss Proust's madeleine moment or Li Bai's poetry! 📚
[A]:  Actually... you know what? Maybe I will drop by sometime. That madeleine discussion sounds way more interesting than binary trees anyway! See you around, professor! 
[B]: What a delightful turn of events!  I'll be sure to have the tea ready - Earl Grey with a dash of literary theory. Until then, may your days be filled with more poetry than programming! 再见!
[A]:  再见 indeed! And don't worry, I'll bring cookies to our next chat - the madeleines have me inspired! 
[B]: Ah, madeleines and memories - how perfectly Proustian!  I shall look forward to our literary tea time. Do mind the step on your way out - it's rather uneven, much like the narrative structure in Faulkner's works! 🌹
[A]:  I'll watch my step - both literally and metaphorically! See you for tea and unreliable narrators! 
[B]:  What a serendipitous encounter... Now, where was I? Ah yes, "The autumn leaves fall like pages from an unfinished manuscript..."
