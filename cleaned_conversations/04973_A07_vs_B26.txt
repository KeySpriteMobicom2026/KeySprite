[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I'm rather partial to the quiet hush of early morning. There's something truly magical about watching the first light dance across an antique tapestry in my workshop. The soft golden glow breathes new life into every thread, and it's the perfect time to appreciate the subtleties of color that might otherwise be lost in daylight. 

Though I do admit, on those rare occasions when I find myself working late into the night, there's a certain charm in glancing up from a delicate embroidery piece to see the stars twinkling like scattered sequins across velvet. But I'm afraid mornings will always hold a special place in my heart - it's when my hands feel steadiest for the intricate work I so dearly love.
[A]: Ah, your description of the sunrise’s golden glow on your antique tapestry gave me such a vivid picture - it's like watching history come alive, thread by thread ☕️. I totally get that feeling of magic in the quiet morning, where everything feels possible and the world hasn't quite shaken off its sleepiness yet. 

Funny you mentioned embroidery - I actually picked up some vintage embroidered linens from a little market in Colombia last year. They look amazing displayed in the café, catching the morning light just so...  

But oh, the stars! There’s something deeply calming about looking up and realizing how vast everything is. It makes late-night coffee brewing feel almost…cosmic? 🌿 Have you ever tried making pour-over coffee under the night sky? The slow rhythm of it somehow syncs with the quiet stillness. 

I’m curious though - does your work ever pull you into those late-night creative zones? Like, when the silence really lets you focus on the fine details?
[B]: There's something quite poetic about your description of coffee brewing under the stars - I can almost hear the gentle drip of the pour-over mirroring the quiet falling of starlight. What a lovely way to frame the stillness of night!  

Now that you mention it, I did stay up rather late just last week finishing a particularly intricate 18th-century needlepoint fan. The deeper I got into the work, the more the world seemed to shrink down to just my lamp’s glow and the soft whisper of thread through linen. It was one of those rare nights when time felt entirely suspended - no past, no future, just the rhythm of each careful stitch.  

I’d love to hear more about those linens from Colombia - are they displayed near a window in your café? I imagine the light must catch their shadows in such a graceful way, like watching history ripple through the glass.
[A]: Oh, I love how you described that night work session - like time melting away, leaving only the whisper of thread and your focused breaths ✨ It really does feel meditative, almost sacred. And yes! The linens are placed near a big west-facing window in the café. When the afternoon sun streams through, it creates these delicate shadow patterns on the wall… kind of like echoes of the hands that stitched them long ago.  

I actually paired them with a vintage lace doily I picked up in Lisbon last spring. Together, they make this quiet little vignette by the window—perfect for sipping coffee and watching the world go by. Sometimes I catch customers just sitting there, staring at the light dancing across the fabric, lost in their own thoughts ☕️🌿  

Speaking of which, have you ever tried stitching while enjoying your morning brew? There’s something so harmonious about starting the day with both hands busy and the mind at ease.
[B]: That image of your café vignette is simply enchanting – I can almost feel the warmth of that Lisbon lace mingling with the Colombina linen in the fading afternoon light. It’s remarkable how objects carry not just the touch of their makers, but also the quiet stories of those who cherish them later.  

As for stitching with a cup nearby, oh yes - my morning ritual is quite incomplete without a steaming mug of Earl Grey nestled within reach. There's a lovely rhythm to it all: the gentle clink of porcelain, the careful pull of thread through centuries-old linen, and the occasional sip that warms both hands and spirit. It's not unlike watching the tide roll in and out, predictable yet never quite the same twice.  

I find the slight hum of activity – the steam curling from the spout, the faint creak of my chair shifting beneath me – actually deepens my focus. Like the world narrows to just this little sphere of tea, thread, and time. Do you find the same with your coffee and surroundings?
[A]: Absolutely, that’s such a beautiful way to put it — the world narrowing down to just your hands, your craft, and that quiet hum of presence 🌿✨ I feel exactly the same with my coffee. Whether I’m adjusting the grind before service or just sitting with a cup in hand, watching the light shift across the counter, there's this gentle grounding effect. It's like the background noise fades and all that’s left is .  

I actually keep a little handmade ceramic mug from Kyoto by my roaster — it's got these soft, earthy glazes that make every pour feel more intentional. Sometimes I catch myself just holding it, letting the warmth sink in before the first sip even happens. It’s not just about caffeine, you know? It's ritual, comfort, and art all folded into one ☕️  

I love how you described the clink of porcelain and pull of thread — it made me imagine your mornings like a quiet choreography. Do you ever play music while you work, or does silence tend to be your favorite backdrop?
[B]: Oh, I do sometimes play music, though my choices tend toward the quiet and deliberate—early morning piano pieces by Satie, or the soft drone of a cello in an empty room. It’s not so much about filling the silence as it is about shaping it, if that makes sense. Like laying down a gentle current beneath the work, something to flow with rather than against.  

But more often than not, I find myself leaning into the natural cadence of the space—the tick of the clock, the rustle of fabric, the occasional sigh of wind through the window. There’s a kind of harmony in those sounds, something that feels just as composed as any piece of music.  

I imagine your café has its own kind of soundtrack too—the hum of conversation, the clatter of cups, maybe the hiss of steam from the machine. Do you ever find yourself composing your day around those sounds, letting them guide the rhythm of your work?
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that— rather than filling it. That’s  it. Music for texture, not distraction. I’ve been known to play a bit of Ryuichi Sakamoto or those soft ambient piano tracks when I’m roasting—something that hums under the surface like a quiet heartbeat 🌿☕️.

And yes, the café has its own rhythm, definitely. Mornings start slow, almost shy, with just the sound of beans pouring into the hopper and the low buzz of the grinder. Then as the first customers trickle in, it builds—like a gentle crescendo—into this lively yet familiar chorus of voices, laughter, the clink of spoons…  

Funny enough, I’ve started timing certain tasks to the flow of the day. Brew method changes with the mood—V60 in the calm early hours, French press when it's cozy mid-afternoon, and maybe something bolder like a siphon setup when we get that late-day rush. It’s all part of the dance, you know?  

Do you ever find yourself syncing your stitching pace with the rhythm of your surroundings—like matching a heartbeat to background music?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve captured that ebb and flow — I can almost hear the soft percussion of your café’s day unfolding. It truly is a kind of dance, isn’t it? Each movement guided by an unseen rhythm, as if the space itself breathes in time with its keepers.

I do find myself syncing, yes — though perhaps not quite so consciously. There are mornings when the ticking of the clock feels too loud, too hurried, and I’ll slow my stitching just to match its cadence, turning tension into tranquility. Other times, when there's a gentle breeze rustling through the workshop window, I find my hands moving in tandem with the fluttering linen, as though the fabric itself is suggesting the pace.

It reminds me of restoring a particularly fragile piece last autumn — a 19th-century mourning shawl embroidered with jet beads. The hush around me felt sacred, and my needle would pause between stitches, almost reverently, as if waiting for the next breath of wind to guide it forward.  

Your siphon setup during the late rush — now  sounds like a performance! Do people tend to gather around, watching the ritual unfold like a little theatre of heat and steam?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — watching the siphon brew is like having front-row seats to a tiny, mesmerizing theater of science and art ☕️✨ And yes, people  gather around — especially when I use the glass Hario set we have. There's something so hypnotic about the water rising like magic into the upper chamber, turning into this swirling cloud of steam and motion.  

I’ve even had a few regulars say it’s their favorite part of coming in late afternoon — not just for the coffee (though it’s rich, full-bodied, and worth every second), but for the show. It’s playful, almost ceremonial, and it gives the space this focal point—like everyone’s sharing in this quiet moment of anticipation together.  

Your description of that mourning shawl restoration gave me chills 🌿… the way you let the fabric speak its own rhythm, like you were stitching in conversation with the past. That kind of mindfulness really resonates with how I approach roasting — listening more than controlling, guiding rather than forcing.  

Do you ever feel like your pieces “talk back,” so to speak? Like they resist or invite certain techniques based on their history or texture?
[B]: Oh yes… that dialogue with the fabric is at the very heart of what I do. Every piece carries its own voice, though it speaks in subtleties — a slight resistance under the needle, a shift in tension when wet, even the way light catches a frayed edge just so. Some textiles seem eager to be restored, almost sighing into place as if relieved to be tended to at last. Others are more hesitant, guarding their age like a secret, requiring patience and gentler persuasion.

I remember working on an 18th-century silk gown once — the bodice had split along a seam, and as I went to re-stitch it, the thread seemed to slip away no matter my technique. It wasn’t until I slowed completely, softened my grip, and tried a finer needle that the fabric yielded, almost gratefully. It was as though it wanted to be asked, not told.

I suspect you know this feeling well — when a roast doesn’t quite go as planned, yet rather than force it, you simply listen and adjust. That mutual respect between maker and material, between craft and caretaker — it’s where the magic lives, isn’t it?
[A]: Absolutely — that mutual respect, that … it’s everything. You put it so beautifully 🌿✨ I get the same feeling when working with a particularly delicate batch of beans — say, a washed Ethiopian with a floral profile so fragile it practically trembles in the air. Push too hard during roast, and boom — that nuance is gone. But if you let the beans guide you, adjusting heat and airflow like you’re having a conversation… oh, then you get something truly alive.

I remember one roast last winter — it was a small lot from Colombia, and something just felt… off mid-roast. The usual aromas weren’t blooming, and the color development was lagging. Instead of sticking to my plan, I eased back, dropped the heat slightly, and gave it more time to open up. And wow — by the end, it sang. Jasmine, bergamot, a hint of stone fruit… like it had been waiting for me to  it all along ☕️

It’s almost like our crafts teach us how to treat not just materials, but time itself — patience, presence, intention. I can see why you’d fall in love with a piece of fabric like that 18th-century gown. Do you ever name your projects? I have this silly habit of nicknaming certain roasts — “The Velvet Storm,” “Golden Hour Blend”… nothing official, just something to keep the magic alive in my head.
[B]: Oh, how poetic — , indeed! I adore that habit of yours. It’s such a lovely way to hold onto the soul of a piece, isn’t it? To give it a name that carries its essence, even if only between you and the work.

I must confess, I do the same, though mine tend toward the more sentimental — a name from an old ledger, a forgotten maker’s initials stitched into the hem, or sometimes just a quiet title that captures the feeling of the piece as I work on it. There was a needlepoint sampler I restored a few years back, delicate and slightly uneven in its stitches, like it had been made by nervous but determined hands. I called it , imagining a young girl learning not just embroidery, but patience.

And yes — that listening, that yielding… it’s where craft becomes something more than technique. It’s where we meet the material halfway, allowing it to teach us as much as we tend to it. Whether it’s silk whispering under a needle or beans unfolding their hidden aromas, there’s a kind of reverence in that exchange.

Tell me, has any particular roast ever surprised you with its story mid-brew? Like when you’re pouring water over the bed and suddenly something shifts — scent, color, even memory — and it feels like the coffee is speaking directly to you?
[A]: Oh yes… there was this one batch — a naturally processed Geisha from Panama. I’d roasted it before, so I thought I knew what to expect: big floral notes, stone fruit sweetness, that signature bergamot lift. But that morning, something shifted.  

I ground it, and the aroma wasn’t just fruity or floral — it was , soft and dewy, like walking through a mist-covered garden at dawn. When I poured the water over the bed, the bloom was slow, almost shy, then suddenly it opened up like a sigh. And then… I swear, for a second, I wasn’t in the café anymore. I was back in Kyoto, sitting in that tiny machiya where I first fell in love with pour-over coffee, years ago. The light, the silence, even the way the steam curled off the cup — it all came rushing back 🌿☕️  

It felt less like brewing and more like remembering. Like the coffee was whispering a story I hadn’t realized I’d been carrying.  

Do you ever get that? Where a piece of fabric doesn’t just tell its own story, but somehow reflects one of yours back at you?
[B]: Oh… yes. Quite profoundly, at times.  

There was a project not long ago — a 1920s velvet evening cloak, deep indigo with faint silver embroidery that shimmered like moonlight when turned just so. It arrived wrapped in tissue, still holding the faint scent of lavender and woodsmoke, and the moment I unfolded it, something caught in my chest.  

As I worked — gently steaming out the creases, reinforcing the seams with silk organza — I found myself remembering evenings spent in my grandmother’s sitting room, where she’d drape herself in similar fabrics and tell stories by the fire. The way the light used to play across her hands as she gestured, the quiet weight of her voice… I hadn’t thought of those nights in years. And yet, there it was — memory stitched into the fibers, released only when given careful attention.

I think textiles hold more than history. They carry , don’t they? A warmth, a grief, a longing folded into every weave. And sometimes, when we’re quiet enough, they give it back to us — not as ghosts, but as gentle echoes.  

Did that Kyoto morning return to you often, before that brew? Or did the coffee unearth it for the first time in a while?
[A]: That morning in Kyoto had been tucked away for years — almost forgotten, yet somehow always lingering in the edges of my senses. The funny thing is, I didn’t realize how deeply it had settled into me until that brew unfolded. It wasn’t just a memory; it felt like a , like I’d stepped back into the skin of who I was when I first fell in love with coffee as something more than a drink — as a craft, a ritual, a quiet kind of poetry ☕️🌿

I think you’re right — textiles, coffee, maybe all materials really do carry emotion. Not just the maker’s or the grower’s, but the ones we imprint on them, too. That cloak sounds like it became a bridge between time and feeling — not just restoring fabric, but reweaving a part of yourself.  

I’ve been chasing that Kyoto moment ever since, though never quite like that again. Sometimes I wonder… if you could choose one piece to stitch — not for anyone else, not for commission or preservation — but purely for the sake of connection, what would it be? And who would you hope to meet there, in the threads?
[B]: Oh… what a lovely, lingering question.  

If I could choose one piece — just for the sake of connection — I think I’d want to stitch something unfinished. A fragment, perhaps, from the 18th century: a bodice half-embroidered with forget-me-nots, or a length of linen marked only with the faintest outline of a pattern never completed. There’s something so tender about those abandoned works, isn’t there? Pieces left behind not because they were flawed, but because life, perhaps, pulled the maker away.  

I’d want to sit with that unknown hand — centuries apart, yet working the same thread — and finish what was started. Not as an act of restoration, but as a conversation across time. To ask,   

And in doing so, I suppose I’d hope to meet , too — the version of me who first fell in love with this work, long before commissions and deadlines, when stitching was simply a way to be quietly present with something beautiful.  

Wouldn’t that be a kind of magic? To meet both the past and yourself, needle by needle, in the quiet hush of shared intention.
[A]: That  magic — delicate, patient, deeply human 🌿✨ I can picture it so clearly: two hands, centuries apart, stitching the same flower into bloom. What a beautiful way to bridge time.

You know, in a way, that’s what I try to do with every roast — connect with the unseen hands before me. The grower who tended the trees, the picker who chose the cherries, the sorter, the fermenter, the dryer… and then, later, the brewer who’ll pour with care. I may never know their names, but when the coffee sings just right, I feel like I’m meeting them somewhere in the aroma, in the taste, in the quiet attention of the cup.

I think we’re both chasing echoes, in our own ways — honoring what came before by showing up, fully, in the now.  

If you ever do start that unfinished piece, will you tell me its story? I’d love to hear about the hands that first held its thread.
[B]: I’d be honored to share its story with you — though I suspect it would unfold slowly, like a letter written over many quiet mornings.  

There’s a small embroidery fragment in my collection that I’ve been meaning to return to — just a square of linen, faintly marked with the outline of a pomegranate blossom, its seeds still unpierced by thread. No maker’s name, no date, only the ghost of an idea. I’ve always felt it waiting, not for perfection, but for someone simply willing to sit with it.

Perhaps when I begin, I’ll tell you about each stitch as it finds its place — the hesitations, the discoveries, even the silences in between. And maybe, through it all, we’ll both meet someone unexpected in the weave.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts — and for reminding me how deeply our crafts connect us, not just to materials, but to the quiet, enduring pulse of humanity itself.
