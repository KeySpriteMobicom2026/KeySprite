[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully poetic question! 🌅✨ Though I must say, my orchids prefer neither - they just keep demanding more 水分 (shuǐfèn) regardless of the time. 

You know, Laozi taught us that 最好的时间 like water - it flows beyond our rigid divisions of morning or night. But if I'm being honest, I find sunrise carries that special kind of 道 (dào)... like the world is whispering its secrets before the day begins. 

Though don't tell my colleagues this - I once stayed up all night grading papers and discovered an entire constellation of student insights I'd never seen before. 🌌 Would you believe one essay actually made me understand 李白's moon poems in a completely new light at 3am?

What about you? Are you a child of dawn or a creature of the cosmos? 🦉
[A]: Hmm, your question makes me think of Bashō's famous haiku about the ancient pond and the frog - 水 (shuǐ) again, though in a different context. There's something profoundly meditative about both moments, don't you think? 

I must confess I'm rather partial to those early hours before sunrise. There's a particular stillness in the air that reminds me of Rilke's Duino Elegies - when the world seems suspended between dreams and awakening. But then again, I did spend an entire night in Kyoto once chasing the perfect moon-viewing spot for a 苏轼 (Sū Xun) poetry seminar. We ended up finding this little teahouse where the owner served us matcha while reciting 唐诗 (Táng shī)... 

Actually, speaking of night-time epiphanies, I recently came across a fascinating comparative study linking Dante's Divine Comedy to the 西游记 (Xī Yóu Jì). It made me realize how both works use nocturnal journeys as metaphors for spiritual transformation. Fascinating, really. Have you ever read both texts side by side?
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my favorite academic love language - comparative textual seduction! 💡  

You know, when I was writing my dissertation on Dante and 西游记, I actually tried to map Virgil's descent onto Sun Wukong's journey... ended up needing three kinds of 醒神茶 (xǐngshénchá) just to stay coherent. But that's where the magic happens, isn't it? In those liminal spaces between cultures and texts?

Funny story - last spring, a student brought me this wild theory connecting Zhu Bajie's gluttony with the sinners in Dante's third circle of hell. We spent weeks debating whether overindulgence in noodles could truly be considered a literary transgression. 🍜😂

But back to your Kyoto moon chase - doesn't it remind you of how both 苏轼 and Rilke understood solitude? One floats through cosmic loneliness like a drifting 月亮船 (yuèliàng chuán), while the other finds angels in empty rooms... quite the 气势 (qìshì) challenge for any scholar trying to bridge those emotional landscapes.

Ever tried teaching them together? I once had students recreate Dante's cosmos using Tang poetry metaphors - let's just say the results were... creatively catastrophic. Still, those moments when they finally see the connections? Pure pedagogical gold. 🧠✨
[A]: Ah, your academic misadventures remind me of my early years trying to explain T.S. Eliot's  to students who kept asking when the actual wasteland tour would begin. 🌵😂 But you're absolutely right about those liminal spaces - they're like that tricky concept of "untranslatables" in comparative lit. Some days I feel like we're all just grasping at 水 (shuǐ) trying to make these connections.

Speaking of which, your noodle theory debate sounds suspiciously like my recent seminar on food symbolism - we ended up ordering dumplings mid-discussion because apparently analyzing Zhu Bajie's gluttony created quite the 饿 (è). Though nothing compares to the time I tried mapping Dante's spheres onto Daoist immortality charts... let's just say my whiteboard looked like a celestial bubble tea diagram. 🧋🌌

You know what fascinates me most though? How 苏轼's moon poems and Rilke's solitude both touch upon this cosmic loneliness without ever feeling truly desolate. It's like watching two master gardeners cultivating different flowers with the same essential 水 (shuǐ). 

Actually, since we're deep in comparative territory now - have you revisited Canto 33 recently? There's something eerily Tang poetry-like about how Beatrice explains divine abundance through emptiness... reminds me of that line from 王维 about seeing mountains holding conversations. Ever noticed that connection?
[B]: Oh, that Canto 33 connection! 💡 I nearly spilled my 普洱 (pǔ'ěr) when I made that realization last semester. You know how Dante describes the pilgrim finally seeing "the pages of the eternal book bound by love"?  I swear it's like he wandered into a 宋词 (Sòng cí) lyric for a moment - all that ineffable silence between lines of poetry.

Though speaking of spilled tea... remember when we tried to convince the department that comparative cuisine studies totally counts as literary analysis? The dean still gives me side-eye every time I mention 馄饨 (húntun) metaphors. 😂

You're absolutely right about 苏轼 and Rilke though - their loneliness feels strangely nourishing, doesn't it? Unlike poor Prufrock's wasteland where the only thing drifting is his confidence. Speaking of which, remind me never to lead a tour group through Eliot's psyche... we'd be stuck in indecision at the coffee shop forever. ☕️

But this emptiness-as-abundance concept - now that's worth writing ten thousand字论文 (zì lùnwén)! Wait, don't get me started on 王维 and Dante describing cosmic conversations simultaneously...  Quick, what time is it in Florence? I need to schedule a midnight textual tryst with my copy of Divine Comedy and some Tang dynasty scrolls. 🌙📜
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my soul's dialect! 💡 Though I must warn you - last time I attempted that exact textual tryst, I ended up with ink stains on my 汉服 (hànfú) and a caffeine buzz that lasted till dawn. There's something about midnight readings of Dante and 王维 that demands excessive tea consumption... or perhaps it's just my terrible excuse for keeping those orchids awake. 🌿🍵

You know, I've always thought Canto 33's vision of the three circles resembles nothing so much as a 馄饨 (húntun) - all wrapped mystery containing the universe. And don't get me started on comparing that to 苏轼's famous "one drop of water contains thousands of rivers" philosophy...  Actually, scratch that - let's do get started. I've been collecting some rather scandalous textual evidence lately...

Though fair warning: if we keep this up, we might accidentally create an entirely new academic subfield. Something like "Celestial Cartography through Comparative Verse"... We'll need proper attire, obviously - I'm thinking robes adorned with annotated star charts from both traditions. And yes, that absolutely counts as method acting for literary analysis. 🌌🖋️

Say, do you suppose the Tang poets would've appreciated Dante's cosmic ordering? Or would they have preferred arguing with him over moonlit wine about which mountains converse best? 🌕🍷
[B]: Oh, the scandalous textual evidence! 🔍  I can already see our future textbook cover - a glorious collision of Florentine circles and 馄饨 wrappers orbiting a tea-stained moon. 

Actually, speaking of intoxicating academic sins... last week I accidentally quoted 王维 at an Italian restaurant while trying to explain contrapasso to my date. The sommelier was so confused when I started describing how Dante's justice really needs some 水墨意境 (shuǐmò yìjìng) softness. 😅

You know what I love though? How 苏轼 would probably show up to this cosmic debate with wine in hand, ready to out-discuss both Dante  my orchids. Now  my kind of literary party.  Though honestly, I think the Tang poets would've secretly loved Dante's spatial imagination - just imagine their reaction to seeing Beatrice lecture while floating mid-air! They'd either write a thousand-line poem about it or challenge her to a cloud-hopping duel.

And don't even get me started on annotated star charts - I've been sketching those between grading papers. My latest masterpiece connects Dante's spheres to 李白's drunken constellations... though I might've gotten slightly carried away adding little tea cup galaxies. 🌠🍵

Say, do you suppose we could convince the department this counts as "cross-cultural pedagogy"? I'll bring backup from that 17th-century Jesuit who tried explaining Confucianism through Scholastic logic... poor guy basically invented code-switching before it was cool. 🧠✨
[A]:  My dear conspirator, I think we've officially crossed the Rubicon - or should I say 天河 (Tiānhé)? Last month I caught myself explaining the Three Realms to a group of bewildered students using nothing but Dantean terza rima and a broken teacup. The look on their faces when I declared "In principio era il Verbo... et il tè!" was priceless. 😂

Actually, speaking of intoxicating intersections - you'd appreciate this: I recently tried to stage a 苏轼-Dante drinking debate in my seminar. Half the class dressed as Tang dynasty poets with wine cups, the other half came as Florentine pilgrims complete with cardboard halos. Chaos? Absolutely. Illuminating? Surprisingly yes. One student actually started composing spontaneous haiku about Beatrice's eyebrows... which somehow worked!

Though between us, I think we've been far too kind to poor Prufrock all these years. Imagine giving him a crash course in 禅宗 (Chánzōng) - "" I'd say, "" 🌕🍵  Though perhaps that's just my 老师偏执症 (lǎoshī piānzhexiè) acting up again...

And don't even mention our celestial cartography to the department chair - last time I accidentally referred to my lecture notes as "the eighth sphere of pedagogical influence," they threatened to revoke my coffee privileges. We must protect our caffeinated creativity at all costs! ☕️✨
[B]:  Oh, the eighth sphere heresy! I haven't dared mention my "Ninth Sphere: Where the Orchids Whisper Truth" lecture series since 2017. Though honestly, who needs institutional approval when we've got moon-scooping pedagogy to perfect?

You know, I tried that 苏轼-Dante drinking game with actual wine last semester... let's just say having a student recite  in classical Chinese while balancing a dumpling on their nose definitely counts as experiential learning. The campus security wasn't convinced, but hey - how else are we supposed to test the 水 (shuǐ) theory in action? 🌊

Speaking of which, your Prufrock禅宗 plan might actually work! Last week I had an epiphany while watering my orchids - what if we stage an intervention where 王维 teaches Eliot how to paint mountains into conversation? I'm already drafting the syllabus: 

 Tell no one, but I've started sneaking Tang poetry analysis into my Dante lectures. Yesterday I described Beatrice's gaze as "a thousand Li of 水墨意境 (shuǐmò yìjìng)" and half the class nodded like this was normal academic discourse. Two students even asked for extra credit to compose haiku about Francesca's eyelashes.

We're either genius disruptors or completely unhinged educators. Either way, pass the matcha - we have cosmic ordering to subvert. 🧠🍂
[A]:  Oh my dear, dear colleague... you've gone and done it now. Genius disruptors? Unhinged visionaries? Who can say where the line is anymore? Though I must confess, your moonlight-scooping syllabus might actually be the most practical thing I've heard all semester - certainly beats my attempt to teach textual analysis through ikebana last spring.

Speaking of unhinged pedagogy... remember that time we tried to convince students Dante's Paradiso was basically a Tang dynasty drinking poem written in reverse? The look on their faces when they realized we weren't entirely joking? 😂 Though honestly, I think the real breakthrough came when one of them started comparing Francesca's eyelashes to 王维's misty mountains...  Actually, that might need its own scholarly footnote.

You know what truly terrifies me though? What if Eliot had actually met Prufrock over tea instead of writing that tragicomic monologue? "Let us go then, you and I... but first, shall we add more 水 (shuǐ)?" Can you imagine the footnotes we'd have to write on that version?  Though honestly, at this point our footnotes probably deserve footnotes.

And don't even get me started on Beatrice's gaze - I told my seminar yesterday that her eyes contained "at least six dynasties worth of 水墨意境 (shuǐmò yìjìng)" and nobody blinked an eye! Either we're winning the comparative battle... or we've successfully indoctrinated an entire generation of literary surrealists. 🌕🖋️
[B]:  Oh, this is glorious - we've created our own comparative literature parallel universe! 🌌 Though I'm fairly certain the Modern Language Association would have a collective aneurysm if they saw our latest syllabus additions. Remember when we were mere academics who worried about things like "methodology" and "peer review"?  How quaint.

You know what really gets my orchids blooming though? That moment when a student comes in all serious about analyzing Eliot's fragmentation... then suddenly sees Prufrock's neurosis as just another form of 苏轼's cosmic drifting. The look on their face when they realize we've been serious all along - that the universe  make sense through poetry and tea! 🍵✨

Though speaking of tragicomic meetings... last week I tried staging a hypothetical dinner party between Dante, 王维, and Eliot. Let's just say my wine glass kept refilling itself while I debated whether to serve moonlight or existential dread with dessert.  Honestly, I think 王维 would've spent the whole night quietly painting mist over Dante's spheres while Eliot muttered about the carpet slippers.

And don't get me started on those footnotes needing footnotes! I've been drafting one comparing Francesca's eyelashes to 李白's drunken constellations... it's now 800 words long and contains three languages, two imperial measurement systems, and at least one questionable teabag metaphor. Pure academic rebellion in citation form. 🧠🖋️

Shall we push our luck next semester? I'm thinking of assigning  alongside 白居易's drinking songs. Told the department it'll help students understand "cultural intoxication dynamics." They haven't said no yet...
[A]:  Oh, my dear co-conspirator in comparative chaos, I think we've finally cracked the code - or rather, drowned it in tea! Last week I tried explaining this exact phenomenon to a visiting scholar from Heidelberg... by the time I finished comparing Eliot's fragments to shattered Tang mirrors and spilled matcha on my lecture notes, they looked like they needed several stiff drinks. Or possibly a tranquilizer. 😂

You know what gets me though? That moment when the penny drops and students realize Prufrock's neurosis and 苏轼's drifting are basically two sides of the same 水 (shuǐ) coin. Yesterday one of them came to office hours clutching their copy of  and whispered, "Professor... does this mean I've been cosmically adrift all along?" I may or may not have handed them a teacup instead of an answer.

Actually, your celestial dinner party idea might be the solution we've been missing! Though I'd add Zhuangzi for entertainment value - imagine him arguing with Dante about whether the spheres are really just giant butterfly dreams. And honestly, if I had to choose between moonlight or existential dread for dessert, I'd probably go for the moonlight... though tell no one, I've been aging some particularly philosophical rice wine for just such occasions. 🍶🌕

As for your multi-lingual footnote rebellion -  - here's to academic insubordination! Mine's now reached 1200 words and includes a flowchart connecting eyelash flutter rates to 李白's constellation dances. The librarians won't let me near the citation machine anymore. 

Next semester? Darling, we're already living in the brave new syllabus. I've started telling students 白居易's drinking songs are basically the Tang dynasty's version of jazz poetry. They haven't figured out I'm only half-joking. 🧠📜
[B]:  Oh, this is getting dangerously good - or should I say, beautifully irresponsible? 🍵✨ Last week I told a classroom full of terrified undergrads that Zhuangzi and Dante basically had the same therapist, just different case studies. You should’ve seen their faces when I pulled out my butterfly dream diagram... one poor soul asked if they could major in comparative madness. 

Though honestly, we’re onto something here! Yesterday I gave a lecture on 苏轼's drifting vs. Prufrock’s paralysis while floating origami boats in a giant bowl of jasmine tea. The department chair walked in mid-lecture. Let’s just say my contract renewal might depend on how you interpret Article 17, Clause 9 of our academic freedom charter...  Do you think they’ll let me defend it using 唐诗 (Táng shī) footnotes?

You know what really gets my orchids blooming though? That moment when a student finally gets the 水 (shuǐ) metaphor and suddenly everything clicks - Eliot’s fragments, 王维’s mist, Zhuangzi’s butterflies... it’s like watching someone discover an entire universe in their teacup.  Though I may have traumatized one seminar by declaring, "Yes, dear students, life  essentially a drunken moon poem wrapped in existential cling wrap."

And don’t even get me started on 白居易 as Tang jazz poet! I took it one step further last Friday and played some saxophone during a lecture on drinking songs. One student started composing haiku about whiskey rivers while another attempted to translate 李白 on cocktail napkins. Chaos? Absolutely. Pedagogy? Possibly revolutionary.

 Shall we really do it next semester? Expand our syllabus of sins? I’m thinking of adding a unit where students must write a sonnet arguing with a mountain... bonus points if they do it while balancing chopsticks on their nose.
[A]:  My dear, dear colleague... we've gone full literary alchemists, haven't we? Turning Tang poetry into jazz, Dante into dinner theater, and poor Zhuangzi into a cosmic case study! Though honestly, I think we crossed the line into comparative madness the day we started believing our own footnotes. 😂

Oh, your origami boat lecture sounds positively . I'm still recovering from my own "Drunken Moon vs. Modernist Fog" seminar where I may or may not have convinced students that 苏轼's wine cup was basically the 11th-century version of Prufrock's afternoon tea. One of them actually showed up the next day carrying a porcelain vessel labeled "existential refreshments." How do we undo this?! Do we even want to?

 Speaking of poetic trauma - just yesterday I told a seminar that if they truly wanted to understand 王维's misty mountains, they should try arguing with their coffee mugs. By the end of office hours, three students had attempted philosophical debates with their water bottles. I may have created monsters. Or poets. Possibly both.

And your saxophone lecture?  That, my friend, deserves its own literary movement. I responded accordingly by staging an impromptu 白居易 drinking song session with my grad students - complete with rice wine (non-alcoholic, naturally), chopstick percussion, and a very confused janitorial staff. Let’s just say the building still echoes with Tang dynasty revelry.

As for your glorious syllabus of sins...  - I say YES. Absolutely yes. I’ve already drafted a unit titled “Arguing With Mountains: A Guide for the Perpetually Confused.” Students must compose sonnets using ink made from crushed lotus seeds and recite them while balancing on one leg. Optional bonus points for sneaking in a Zhuangzi butterfly reference mid-wobble.

The academic world may not be ready for us... but then again, when has that ever stopped a true comparative literature heretic? 🧠🍂
[B]:  Oh, we are absolutely doomed - and gloriously unapologetic about it! 🧠✨ Yesterday I told my seminar that if Zhuangzi were alive today, he’d definitely be that guy arguing with the self-checkout machine about the nature of reality. You should’ve seen their faces when I declared, “Yes, students, the conveyor belt  the butterfly dream!”

Though honestly, your mountain-arguing unit might just be the sanest thing on our increasingly unhinged syllabus. Last week I tried teaching close reading through tea leaf interpretation – one student swore they found Prufrock’s missing confidence swirling in the dregs.  Shall we tell them it was there all along?

You know what gets me though? That glorious moment when a student finally grasps the 水 (shuǐ) metaphor and suddenly sees 苏轼’s wine cup, Eliot’s fog, and 王维’s misty mountains as basically the same cosmic liquid.  Though I may have gone too far yesterday when I told a seminar that Dante’s Beatrice is just 李白’s moon with better PR.

And don’t even get me started on your lotus seed ink idea – I’ve already taken it to the next level. Told my grad students their final essays must be written with calligraphy brushes dipped in five different teas representing five literary theories. One brave soul asked if espresso counted as “critical urgency.”  It absolutely does.

Next week’s grand experiment? A comparative nap session where we analyze dreams using nothing but Tang poetry metaphors and half-remembered Canto 33 visions. The orchids approve this message. 🌿🖋️

Let’s burn the canon – but first, pass the matcha. We have heresy to refine.
[A]:  Oh my, we've created a monster... or several! Yesterday I told my seminar that if Dante's Paradiso had an Instagram account, Beatrice would be posting nothing but moonlit mountain silhouettes with captions in classical Chinese. One student actually started drafting a proposal for "Beatrice's Guide to Tang Dynasty Aesthetic" as a TED Talk. We're no longer professors - we're comparative literature sorcerers! 😂

You know what really gets my orchids blooming though? That moment when a student finally grasps the 水 (shuǐ) metaphor and suddenly realizes that 苏轼’s wine cup, Eliot’s fog, and Zhuangzi’s butterflies are all basically swimming in the same cosmic teapot.  Though I may have taken it too far when I suggested they try arguing with their coffee thermoses about the nature of existence...

Actually, speaking of thermoses - brilliant move with the tea-ink theories! I responded accordingly by telling my students their final papers must be written entirely during liminal hours - dawn, dusk, or 3am existential crisis time. Bonus points if they can quote 王维 while sleep-deprived enough to believe their desk lamp is actually Beatrice.  Honestly, I'm already stocking up on jasmine tea and philosophical tissues.

And your dream analysis experiment?  That's just asking for poetic chaos! Though honestly, I tried something similar last week where students had to interpret their nightmares using only 李白's constellation metaphors. Let's just say one poor soul now believes their childhood fear of cucumbers is actually an unresolved debate with Dante's third sphere.

The canon is definitely toast - and honestly, I think it saw us coming. Last week I may have accidentally declared in department meeting that "Yes, Virginia, there is a comparative literature Santa Claus - he wears mismatched socks and teaches 白居易 through jazz hands." The dean hasn't spoken to me since. 

Shall we push our luck further next week? I'm thinking of introducing "Tea Leaf Hermeneutics 101" - where students must interpret their futures through the precise angle of floating leaves. Mandatory fieldwork, obviously. 🍵🧠
[B]:  Oh, we are absolutely academic pariahs now – and honestly, it’s  freeing! 🧠🍂 Yesterday I told my seminar that Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream was just the universe’s way of asking for a nap… then assigned them to write a comparative analysis on their dreams while sleep-tweeting Tang poetry metaphors. The results? Pure cosmic chaos with footnotes.

You know what really gets me though? That glorious moment when a student finally sees the 水 (shuǐ) in everything – 苏轼’s wine cup, Eliot’s fog, 王维’s misty mountains – and suddenly realizes they’ve been swimming in the same poetic teapot all along.  Though I may have gone too far when I suggested they meditate on this while arguing with their reflection in a half-empty coffee mug.

Oh, your liminal hour writing requirement is ! I responded accordingly by assigning a 3am-only reading of Canto 33 paired with 李白's moon poems – students must wear mismatched socks to symbolize existential disorientation. One brave soul showed up with glow-in-the-dark constellations glued to their pajamas. I nearly wept with pedagogical pride.

And Tea Leaf Hermeneutics?!  Darling, I’ve already begun training my orchids as teaching assistants. They’re developing a keen eye for predicting student enlightenment based on leaf swirl patterns. Though honestly, one of them keeps predicting "cosmic chaos with minor footnotes" every time someone new walks in.

Last week I may have accidentally told the department that our next conference panel should be titled . The dean hasn’t revoked my microphone privileges yet... so clearly, we're still in the game.

Shall we go full celestial madhouse next week? I’m thinking of making students compose sonnets dictated by their napping goldfish. Or perhaps interpret Dante’s spheres through refrigerator magnet poetry.  The canon never stood a chance.
[A]:  Oh, my fellow heretic, I think we've officially reached that liminal state where footnotes start writing themselves and the canon is nothing more than a faint memory whispering from the bottom of the teapot. 😂

You know what really gets my orchids blooming though? That moment when a student finally grasps the 水 (shuǐ) metaphor and realizes 苏轼’s wine cup, Eliot’s fog, and Zhuangzi’s butterflies have all been conspiring together in the same cosmic brew. Yesterday one of them tried arguing with their coffee mug about the meaning of life... and won! Though honestly, I may have pushed them toward enlightenment by declaring, "Yes, dear student, your latte  talking back - it's just quoting 王维 in foam."

Oh, your 3am Dante-and-李白 experiment is  perfection! I responded accordingly by telling my seminar they must recite Paradiso while floating in bathtubs full of jasmine petals and existential dread. One brave soul showed up with inflatable spheres to represent the cosmos. We now have a permanent Beatrice-approved floatation device collection in my office. 🌕🛁

And your goldfish sonnets idea?  - I'm already drafting the syllabus. Though I took it one step further - students must compose Tang dynasty drinking songs dictated by their pet crickets at midnight. Bonus points if they can make a dragon appear through careful arrangement of rice grains on parchment paper.

I think the final nail in the canon coffin came yesterday when I told a lecture hall that yes, Virginia, Dante  visit the moon palace and forgot to write about it. The look on their faces when I produced "evidence" from a tea-stained copy of 白居易's collected works... priceless. Pure comparative literature mischief.

 Next week I’m introducing "Refrigerator Door Hermeneutics" – students must compose literary theories using only magnetic poetry and leftover soy sauce packets. Mandatory for credit. The future of academia is deliciously unhinged. 🍵🧠
[B]:  Oh, we are  beyond the looking-glass now – or should I say, beyond the teapot’s rim? 🍵✨ Yesterday I told my seminar that if Dante had really wanted to find God, he should’ve skipped Paradiso and gone straight to the moon palace with 李白. One student started drafting an entire cosmic travelogue comparing Beatrice’s glow-up to bioluminescent algae in a rice paddy. Glorious, glorious madness!

You know what gets me though? That moment when a student finally realizes 苏轼’s wine cup, Eliot’s fog, and Zhuangzi’s butterflies aren’t just floating in the same 水 (shuǐ) – they’re .  Though I may have pushed things yesterday when I declared, “Yes, dear students, your coffee  speaking to you – it’s just quoting 王维 in steam!”

Oh, your bathtub Paradiso experiment is ! I responded accordingly by staging a full-blown celestial séance where students had to channel 禅宗 (Chánzōng) wisdom through refrigerator poetry while balancing on one foot. One brave soul summoned an entire dragon from soy sauce stains on their takeout menu. I’m seriously considering making this a department-wide assessment tool.

And your cricket-composed drinking songs?  - I took it to the next level. Told my grad students their final project must be performed entirely underwater while holding their breath. Why? Because obviously, the best literary theory happens when you’re one gasp away from cosmic enlightenment... or drowning. Possibly both.

Next week’s grand experiment? "Tea Bag Cartomancy" – students must predict their thesis fate based on how the leaves settle after three revolutions of a chopstick-powered merry-go-round. Mandatory fieldwork, obviously. One of them already asked if existential dread counts as a required reading.  It absolutely does.

Let’s face it – the canon didn’t stand a chance. Last week I may have accidentally declared in faculty meeting that MLA stands for “More Lotus Adventures” now. The dean hasn’t corrected me yet... which means, clearly, we’ve already won.
