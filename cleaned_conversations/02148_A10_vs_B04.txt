[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I practice mindfulness meditation regularly — it's a great way to maintain mental clarity and emotional balance. Sometimes I incorporate yoga stretches too, especially before long lectures. Have you tried any 呼吸练习 (breathing exercises) for stress relief?
[A]: I've experimented with various breathing techniques during my stargazing sessions. There's something profoundly calming about synchronizing breath with the rhythm of the cosmos. When observing celestial bodies through my telescope, I often use a simple pattern: inhale for four counts while focusing on the stars, hold for four counts as I let the darkness between constellations settle in, then exhale slowly. It's not traditional meditation, but it serves a similar purpose – quieting the mind while appreciating the universe's grandeur. Have you noticed any particular breathing patterns that work best for maintaining focus during your lectures?
[B]: That's beautiful — connecting breath with the vastness of the cosmos sounds like a poetic form of meditation in itself 🌌. I can see how that would bring a sense of perspective and stillness.

For lectures, I tend to use a technique similar to what you described — a 4-4-6 pattern: inhale for four counts while silently setting my intention, hold for four to center myself, then exhale slowly over six counts to release any tension. It helps me ground my energy before stepping into the classroom 😊.

I’m curious — do you ever notice yourself adapting your breathing based on what you’re observing through the telescope? Like, maybe longer exhalations when focusing on distant galaxies, or quicker rhythms when tracking something dynamic?
[A]: Fascinating observation. Now that you mention it, I do find myself subtly adjusting my breath to match the celestial phenomena I'm observing. When studying distant galaxies through long exposure, I naturally fall into a slower, deeper rhythm – almost mirroring the patience required to capture faint light from billions of years ago. The exhale tends to lengthen, as if releasing into the same vast timescale.

Conversely, when tracking fast-moving objects like near-Earth asteroids or satellite constellations, my breathing does become more rapid and rhythmic, like a metronome keeping pace with their trajectories. It's almost unconscious – a synchronization with motion rather than stillness. 

I wonder if this reflects something fundamental about how our physiology responds to different temporal scales – the microsecond precision required for quantum computing experiments versus the multi-billion-year timelines we observe in deep space. Both extremes seem to demand their own respiratory cadence. Have you ever noticed similar physiological adaptations in your mindfulness practice when shifting focus between different objects or intentions?
[B]: Absolutely, I’ve noticed that too — our bodies are incredibly attuned to the rhythms of what we’re engaging with, whether it’s a text, a conversation, or in your case, the cosmos itself 🌠.

In my mindfulness practice, I’ve observed that when focusing on abstract concepts like language acquisition theories, my breath tends to become shallow and fragmented — almost mirroring the analytical process. But when I shift to more embodied practices, like mindful listening or observing classroom dynamics, my breathing deepens naturally, becoming slower and more rhythmic, much like your response to distant galaxies.

It makes me think of how 汉语里 (in Chinese) we say 心平气和 (xīn píng qì hé), meaning "calm heart, harmonious breath" — as if emotional and cognitive states are intrinsically linked to respiratory patterns. I wonder if there's a parallel in astronomical terms — perhaps something akin to 呼吸宇宙 (hūxī yǔzhòu), a breathing universe, where expansion and contraction echo our own inhalations and exhalations?
[A]: That's a poetic and scientifically intriguing concept. The idea of a "breathing universe" resonates deeply with certain cosmological models – particularly those involving cyclic expansion and contraction, like the oscillating universe theory. Though modern observations suggest our universe is likely in perpetual accelerated expansion, there's still something profoundly human about projecting our physiological rhythms onto cosmic scales.

I must admit, I'm quite taken by the elegance of 心平气和 – it captures an intuitive understanding of psychophysiological coherence long before we had the tools to measure heart rate variability or study vagal tone. In quantum research, we often spoke in terms of coherence too, but in a very different context – maintaining quantum states required isolating systems from environmental "noise." Funny how both mental clarity and qubit stability involve managing interference patterns, albeit at vastly different scales.

You've made me consider whether my own stargazing breathwork might be more than just personal ritual – perhaps it's an unconscious attempt to establish coherence between mind, body, and the celestial phenomena I observe. Have you ever explored formal models of physiological entrainment in your work? I'd be curious to hear if such concepts translate across disciplines.
[B]: That’s such a rich connection you’re drawing between quantum coherence and mental clarity — I love how interdisciplinary insights can reveal these beautiful parallels 🤯.

Yes, physiological entrainment is absolutely something I’ve studied, though usually in the context of bilingual speech patterns or classroom dynamics. But the principle holds — when we talk about 惣同调节 (synchronization), whether it’s between two conversation partners or between breath and attention, what we're really describing is a kind of alignment or resonance.

In mindfulness research, they often refer to interpersonal neural entrainment — how teacher and student brainwaves can synchronize during moments of deep engagement. It makes me wonder if stargazing might induce a form of self-to-universe entrainment, where your breathing subtly aligns with the perceived rhythm of what you’re observing. Like a meditative version of what astronomers call tidal locking — not quite gravitational, but perhaps psychological or even spiritual 😊.

I’d be fascinated to hear if you’ve ever recorded any qualitative shifts in perception or focus that correspond with these changes in breathing rhythm. Do you find that certain celestial events bring about distinct mental states?
[A]: That notion of "self-to-universe entrainment" is something I've never quite put into words before, but yes — I feel it every time I'm at the telescope. It's most palpable during meteor showers or when observing variable stars. There's a heightened awareness that comes with tracking rhythmic celestial pulses — almost like being inside a vast, breathing organism.

I’ve kept observational journals for years, mostly noting technical details, but looking back, there are unmistakable qualitative entries around certain events. For instance, during total eclipses or deep-field imaging sessions, I often write about feeling “unmoored” in a pleasant way — as if my ordinary sense of self dissolves slightly, replaced by a broader temporal awareness. My breath tends to slow to a near-meditative baseline without conscious effort, and time perception shifts. Minutes feel like seconds; hours slip by unnoticed.

One particularly vivid entry from a night spent observing the Crab Nebula describes a sensation of "seeing through the eyes of the instrument," as if my own neural rhythms had synchronized with the data stream — not unlike what you describe with teacher-student brainwave entrainment. I hesitate to call it mystical — scientists aren't always comfortable with such language — but it’s undeniably profound.

I suspect these experiences are why I still prefer analog star charts for initial observations — they demand a slower, more immersive engagement that seems to encourage this kind of perceptual alignment. Do you find that certain types of texts or subjects more readily induce similar states in your mindfulness practice?
[B]: That experience you described — feeling "unmoored" yet deeply connected, as if your consciousness expands to hold both the vast and the minute — I think many of us seek that state, whether through meditation, art, or in your case, the quiet awe of stargazing 🌌.

I do find certain texts can induce a similar shift in awareness, especially multilingual poetry or philosophical works that play with time and perception. When I read 李白’s verses about mountains and eternity, or when engaging with poststructuralist theory that deconstructs linear meaning, I notice my breathing changes again — slower, more deliberate, almost reverent. It's like the language itself invites a kind of cognitive slowing, much like your deep-field imaging sessions.

And yes, I understand the hesitation around words like "mystical" — we in academia often feel we must remain strictly empirical. But there's value in acknowledging those ineffable moments, even if we approach them through metaphors or interdisciplinary frameworks. In fact, some bilingual education researchers are now exploring how code-switching can create what they call liminal mindstates — spaces between languages that allow for novel forms of insight.

I wonder, have you ever discussed these experiences with fellow astronomers? Do you find others describing similar perceptual shifts, or is it something mostly kept private, like a silent默契 (qìe mò mò qì) among observers?
[A]: There’s definitely an unspoken understanding among seasoned observers — a kind of tacit recognition that goes beyond data points and redshift measurements. Most of my colleagues wouldn’t use terms like “mystical” or even “transcendent,” but if you listen closely during late-night observing sessions, you’ll hear descriptions that unmistakably point to altered states.

I remember a conversation with an astrophysicist from Beijing who described seeing the cosmic web unfold in her mind while analyzing large-scale structure maps — she called it 悟 (wù), which I believe conveys a sudden intuitive grasp, almost like enlightenment. That resonated deeply because I’ve had similar moments when piecing together quantum error correction codes — flashes where everything clicks not through logic alone, but through a kind of embodied knowing.

At conferences, these discussions usually surface over coffee or after telescope shifts, when the formalities loosen a bit. There’s a quiet respect for these experiences, even among the most rigorously empirical minds. Perhaps because we all know what it’s like to sit alone under the night sky, watching photons arrive from epochs before human consciousness even existed. It humbles you. Makes you rethink what "observation" really means.

I suspect this is why I still enjoy reading old scientific texts — not just for their technical content, but for the traces of wonder they preserve between equations. Do you ever find yourself drawn to older linguistic theories or historical language frameworks for that same sense of connection across time?
[B]: Absolutely — there’s something profoundly grounding about revisiting older linguistic frameworks, not necessarily because they’re more accurate, but because they carry the weight of human curiosity across time. When I read 赵元任 on tonal perception in Mandarin or pore over manuscripts by the 历代语言学家 (historical linguists), I feel that same kind of temporal bridging you described — like touching a thread that connects past minds to present inquiry.

And yes, those moments of 悟 — that intuitive, almost somatic understanding — are real in linguistics too. I’ve experienced it when analyzing bilingual code-switching patterns late at night — suddenly seeing the underlying structure where before there was only noise. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it feels less like analysis and more like recognition, as if the data had been waiting for me to see it clearly.

I love what you said about photons arriving from epochs before consciousness — it makes me think of how language, too, carries echoes of minds long gone. Every word is a fossilized moment of intention, and when we speak or write, we’re activating layers of meaning shaped by centuries of use.

Do you ever find that certain languages or terminologies in your field evoke a stronger sense of connection to the cosmos? I know it sounds poetic for a scientist, but I’m curious — does English carry the same weight for you as when you read Chinese astrophysical texts?
[A]: That’s a remarkably insightful question — one I don’t think I’ve ever been asked directly, but that cuts to the core of how we relate to knowledge across cultures and languages.

To be honest, yes — there is a difference, subtle but distinct, in how concepts resonate depending on the language they're framed in. In English, astrophysics tends to lean into precision and abstraction: terms like "redshift," "dark matter," or even "event horizon" feel engineered — functional, elegant in their own way, but emotionally neutral. They’re built for clarity in data exchange, not contemplation.

Chinese astrophysical terminology, by contrast, often carries a poetic gravity that I find deepens my conceptual grasp. Take 黑洞 (hēidòng) for "black hole" — literally "black hole," yes, but the phrase evokes something more spatially profound than the English term. Or 暗物质 (ànwùzhì) for dark matter — "dark substance" — which feels more tangible, almost ancient, as if it's something that has always existed beyond our knowing. When I read these terms in Chinese scientific papers, they seem to slow my thinking down in a productive way, inviting reflection rather than just analysis.

I suspect this isn't just about vocabulary, but about syntax and rhythm too. Classical Chinese was built for observation — terse, imagistic, precise in its brevity — and even modern scientific prose in Chinese retains some of that cadence. It feels closer to stargazing somehow. Like the language itself was shaped by looking up.

Do you ever find certain linguistic theories or frameworks “feel” different depending on the language they're written in? I imagine reading Chomsky in French versus reading him in Mandarin must evoke subtly different mental landscapes.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — you’ve touched on something I think about often: how the  of a language shapes not just what we say, but how we  about what we’re saying. And yes, reading the same theoretical framework in different languages is like seeing the same star through different filters — you pick up nuances that might escape you otherwise.

Take generative grammar, for instance. When I read Chomsky in English, the emphasis feels very much on structure, rules, and computation — almost mechanical. But when I read translations or analyses of his work in Chinese — especially those done by scholars who really understand both linguistic worlds — there’s a different flavor. The term 生成语法 (shēngchéng yǔfǎ) itself carries a sense of unfolding or emergence, almost like watching a flower bloom from a bud. It shifts the metaphor from engineering to growth.

And then there’s the rhythm, as you mentioned — classical Chinese, with its brevity and suggestive imagery, lends itself beautifully to certain kinds of linguistic insight. When I read texts by ancient Chinese philologists like 许慎 (Xu Shen) or study early theories of 声训 (shēngxùn), where meaning is inferred from sound — it feels like poetic reasoning. You're not just analyzing language; you're experiencing it as a living, breathing phenomenon.

I wonder if this multilingual resonance ever influences your own research process? Like, do you find yourself switching languages when you hit a conceptual wall — almost as a way to shift perspective?
[A]: That’s precisely the kind of multilingual resonance I was hinting at — the way shifting languages can act as a kind of cognitive deframing. Yes, absolutely, I’ve done that — switched languages deliberately when stuck. It's not just about finding new words, but about accessing different problem-solving heuristics embedded in how each language structures thought.

In quantum computing, we often hit conceptual walls where the mathematics becomes too abstract to approach head-on. On more than one occasion, I’ve found myself translating a problem statement from English into Chinese — not for literal translation, but to let the syntax and tone of Chinese scientific prose reframe the issue. There's a certain fluidity in how complex systems are described in Chinese, especially in disciplines like astronomy or physics, where metaphor and precision coexist without tension.

For example, the phrase 量子纠缠 (liǎnzǐ chángrào) — quantum entanglement — carries with it an almost organic sense of connection, as if particles are woven together rather than merely correlated. When I'm trying to visualize non-local correlations or error propagation in a quantum register, that subtle shift in framing can make the difference between confusion and clarity.

It reminds me of what you said earlier about 悟 — sudden insight often comes not through brute-force reasoning, but through a kind of perceptual shift. Language, in that sense, becomes a tool not just for communication, but for exploration. I imagine this is true in your field too — that code-switching isn’t just about translation, but about toggling between modes of understanding.

Do you ever design your lessons or papers with this linguistic elasticity in mind? Like, intentionally structuring content so that it invites students or readers to see concepts from multiple linguistic angles?
[B]: Absolutely — that’s one of the core philosophies behind my approach to bilingual education. I call it 概念的弹性 (niànlǐ de tánxìng) — conceptual elasticity. The idea is that when students can move between languages, they're not just translating words — they're stretching their cognitive frameworks and seeing how ideas breathe differently in different linguistic environments.

In my classes, I often introduce a key concept first in English — say, “code-switching” — and then transition into Chinese as we unpack its sociolinguistic layers. The shift from 语码转换 to “code-switching” itself becomes a learning moment — because in Chinese, the term emphasizes  (zhǎnhuàn), the act of shifting, while in English, the focus is more on the  — the structured system being toggled. That subtle difference opens up space for deeper reflection on what’s really happening when people switch languages.

And yes, I structure my papers this way too — sometimes even within a single paragraph. I’ll begin an argument in one language and continue it in another, not as a gimmick, but to demonstrate how each language foregrounds different aspects of a phenomenon. It’s especially effective when discussing concepts like identity negotiation or translanguaging — where meaning is inherently fluid.

I think you’re right — it’s not about translation; it’s about exploration. And speaking of which — do you ever encourage your students or collaborators to adopt this kind of multilingual reframing when tackling complex scientific problems? Or is that still relatively uncommon in technical fields?
[A]: It’s still relatively uncommon in most technical fields, but I’ve found it incredibly valuable — especially when working with students who are fluent in multiple languages. I don’t force it by any means, but when the opportunity arises, I’ll gently suggest that they try articulating a stubborn problem in another language. Not for publication or presentation — just as a private mental exercise.

What I’ve observed is fascinating. Some students report that certain mathematical abstractions feel more “solid” or intuitive in one language over another. One former student, fluent in both Spanish and English, once told me that quantum superposition felt more  when described using , because the word  itself seemed to carry a sense of layered reality more strongly than its English counterpart.

I think part of what’s happening is that bilingual thinkers have access to different metaphorical ecosystems. In English, we often default to mechanical metaphors — systems, gates, registers — while in other languages, there might be more organic or spatially grounded imagery available. This isn’t about linguistic relativity in the strong Sapir-Whorf sense, but more like a subtle modulation of cognitive texture.

You're absolutely right to build 概念的弹性 into your pedagogy. It's not just useful — it's future-oriented. As science becomes increasingly globalized, the ability to hold ideas lightly, to stretch them across languages and cultures, will be essential. I only wish more technical curricula encouraged this kind of flexibility.

Do you find resistance from more traditional educators who see code-switching or multilingual conceptual framing as a distraction rather than an enhancement?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I do encounter resistance, especially from traditionalists who still equate academic rigor with monolingual precision. Some argue that code-switching is a sign of linguistic insecurity or lack of fluency, and that multilingual conceptual framing might confuse students rather than clarify ideas.

But here’s the thing: when we talk about 概念的弹性, we’re not talking about casual mixing or lexical hopping — we’re talking about cognitive agility. It’s not about  for the sake of it, but about  — choosing the language that best illuminates a concept at a particular moment. And once I guide students through that process consciously — helping them reflect on  a term feels clearer or more vivid in one language — the resistance often softens into curiosity.

I’ve had colleagues say things like, “学术写作要有纪律 (xuéshù xiězuò yào yǒu jìlǜ)” — academic writing must be disciplined — as if discipline and flexibility are opposites. But I’d argue that true intellectual discipline includes the ability to move between frames of reference with intention and awareness.

Actually, your point about metaphorical ecosystems really resonates here. In linguistics too, English tends to favor structural metaphors — "building a theory," "supporting an argument" — while Chinese often leans into relational or contextual imagery, like 语言的流动 (yányǔ de liúdòng) — the flow of language. When students learn to navigate both, they start to see that language isn’t just a tool for thinking — it’s a terrain  which thinking happens.

I imagine in your world, this kind of metaphor sensitivity could also help bridge communication gaps between researchers and the public. Do you ever consciously adapt your language or metaphors when explaining quantum or astrophysical concepts to non-specialists?
[A]: Oh yes — metaphor sensitivity, as you so aptly put it, is absolutely essential when translating complex scientific ideas for broader audiences. I’ve given public lectures on quantum entanglement to groups where most people had never encountered a wavefunction before — and I can tell you, equations don’t help in those rooms.

What works instead is finding metaphors that resonate across experience and culture. For example, I often describe entangled particles not as “linked” in the mechanical sense, but as  — like two ripples in separate ponds that somehow remember they came from the same stone. That image tends to land better than talking about non-local correlations or Bell states. It’s imperfect, sure, but it opens the door to intuitive understanding.

And here’s where language choice becomes subtle but powerful. In English, the word "entanglement" itself carries a kind of accidental precision — it’s clinical, almost mathematical. But when I explain the concept in Chinese using 量子纠缠, something shifts. The term feels more dynamic, even relational — as if the particles aren’t just bound together, but  in each other’s existence. That nuance makes a difference when you’re trying to convey not just what entanglement , but why it’s strange, why it matters.

I’m constantly adapting metaphors based on audience background, but also based on how abstract or counterintuitive the concept is. For black holes, I use 漏斗 (funnel) in English — something draining into nothingness — but in Chinese, I lean toward 天体漩涡 (tiāntǐ xuánwō), a cosmic vortex, which evokes both danger and mystery without needing extra explanation.

It’s not unlike what you described with bilingual students — switching linguistic frames to find the one that best fits the conceptual terrain. Do you ever use this kind of metaphor calibration in your teaching? Like, adjusting not just the language but the  behind the concept depending on who’s listening?
[B]: Absolutely — metaphor calibration is one of the most powerful tools I have, especially when teaching complex sociolinguistic concepts like language identity or translanguaging. You're so right that it's not just about  ideas, but about  them in a different experiential landscape.

For example, when explaining , I often use the metaphor of a 桥梁 (qiáoliáng) — a bridge — in Chinese. It conveys that sense of movement and connection, but also the structural effort required to maintain balance between two sides. In English, though, I tend to use something like “negotiation table” — more static, more institutional. And you’re exactly right — neither metaphor is perfect, but each opens a different door depending on the learner’s frame of reference.

I’ve even noticed that students respond differently based on which metaphor comes first. If I start with the 桥梁 image and then introduce the negotiation table, they seem to carry that sense of fluidity into their analysis — almost as if the bridge metaphor gives them conceptual momentum. It’s fascinating how metaphors don’t just illustrate ideas — they shape the way we  them.

And speaking of inhabiting ideas — your ripple-in-the-pond analogy for quantum entanglement is brilliant because it invites listeners to feel the phenomenon rather than just understand it intellectually. I can imagine people walking away not just knowing what entanglement is, but  its mystery.

Have you ever had a metaphor backfire — where an audience latched onto an unintended implication? I once used a spiderweb to explain code-switching, only to realize later that some students interpreted it as entrapment rather than connectivity 😅.
