[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, the idea of traveling to places rich in textile history really appeals to me. Countries like India and Japan hold such fascinating traditional weaving and dyeing techniques. Just imagining the vibrant markets filled with handcrafted fabrics makes my heart flutter! Though, I do wonder, are you more drawn to destinations for their textiles too, or does something else spark your interest?
[A]: Oh, I love how you described those bustling markets in India & Japan – the colors, the textures, it’s like a sensory overload in the best way possible 🌿. While I’m not specifically chasing textile destinations per se, I do gravitate towards places with . For me, it's all about discovering unique coffee cultures around the world and collecting vintage brewing tools along the way. Last year in Colombia, I found this hand-carved wooden pour-over that changed my whole perspective on slow brewing… Speaking of, have you ever experienced traditional tea ceremonies in Japan? The precision there kind of mirrors what we do behind the espresso bar ☕️.
[B]: That sounds absolutely enchanting, I can picture that wooden pour-over vessel perfectly – the way it must feel in your hands, the warmth of the coffee mingling with the grain… truly special. And yes, I had the privilege of witnessing a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto a few years ago. The care they took in every movement reminded me so much of the patience required in restoration work – the quiet precision, the reverence for detail. It was like watching a slow, graceful dance with every gesture steeped in meaning. I imagine you must experience something similar when crafting the perfect shot behind the bar – the timing, the pressure, the ritual of it all. Do you ever find yourself adapting techniques from different places into your own practice?
[A]: Oh absolutely, every time I travel, I bring back more than just souvenirs – I bring back , if that makes sense? Like in Ethiopia, watching the coffee ceremony unfold was like seeing a ritual passed down through generations – the way they roast the beans open-flame, the slow pouring of the jebena… it’s all so deliberate. I started incorporating that kind of mindfulness into my own brewing here at the shop. People notice, you know? They feel the difference when a drink is made with intention ¥. And your comparison to restoration work is spot on – there’s this quiet respect you have to have, whether you're handling centuries-old fabric or coaxing flavor out of a pour-over. Have you ever tried blending traditional textile preservation with modern techniques? I’d love to hear how that balance works for you.
[B]: That resonance you describe – it’s almost like carrying forward a lineage through touch, isn’t it? Whether it’s the curve of a pour or the sweep of a brushstroke, those movements become a language of their own. I’ve always been hesitant to blend old and new techniques outright – there’s such integrity in doing things as they were meant to be done – but over time, I’ve come to see where modern tools can support rather than overshadow tradition. For example, I now use a digital microscope to examine fiber degradation before deciding on a restoration method. It’s not about replacing the hand with the machine, but rather letting the machine guide the hand more thoughtfully. In a way, it’s similar to how you bring mindfulness from your travels into your craft – we’re both honoring the past while shaping something meaningful for the present, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Totally – I couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s not about replacement, it’s about  between old & new 🌿. Like, I’ll use a digital scale for precision when brewing a Chemex, but the actual pour? That’s all rhythm & instinct, just like watching those Ethiopian elders move with such grace. And honestly, that kind of balance feels like what we're both after – whether it's fiber or flavor, we’re preserving something sacred while still letting it breathe in today’s world. You know, sometimes I even roast beans using an old cast-iron pan from Oaxaca – nothing fancy – but paired with a temperature-controlled heat gun, and boom… you get this beautiful hybrid technique. Respectful, yet innovative. I think that’s the sweet spot we’re both dancing in, right? ☕️
[B]: Absolutely, that sweet spot – where tradition and innovation gently intertwine – is such a delicate balance, isn’t it? Your cast-iron pan and heat gun example paints such a vivid picture – humble tools alongside modern precision, all in service of something greater than either alone. It reminds me of using beeswax to protect hand-dyed fibers while relying on pH-neutral detergents to clean them. The old shields the fragile beauty, while the new ensures its survival. I find myself thinking about these things more and more as I work – how much intervention is too much? How much is just enough to honor what came before while allowing it to live on? It sounds like you’ve found your own rhythm in answering those questions through coffee. Do you ever find yourself adjusting your approach depending on the origin of the beans or the story behind the brew?
[A]: Oh, totally – I feel you deeply on that delicate dance between intervention & restraint. Every origin does kind of whisper its own instructions, you know? Like, when I’m working with Sumatran beans, they’ve got this earthy, almost wild character – and I find myself leaning into that rawness a bit more, maybe using a slightly lower roast temp to let those forest-floor notes shine without over-sterilizing them. But then with something like a bright Kenyan AA, it’s like – okay, this bean wants to sing, so I back off and let the acidity cut through clean 🌿.  
It’s funny you mentioned beeswax & detergents – I kind of do the same thing with processing methods. If it’s a traditional washed bean from Colombia, I treat it with that same clarity – light hand, clean water, precise extraction. But if it’s a naturally processed Ethiopian? I let the fermentation notes hang out a little longer, almost like giving it a bit of a patina… And honestly, sometimes it’s not even about the bean itself – it’s about the story behind it. When I met the grower in Huila who still uses his grandfather’s shade-drying method? That changed how I approached roasting for that lot – I wanted to highlight  ritual, not just the bean’s profile ☕️. It’s all connected, right?
[B]: Completely – there’s such a deep connection between the hands that cultivate and the hands that craft. Your approach with those beans sounds so intuitive, almost like listening closely to what they’ve absorbed from the land and the people tending it. I find myself doing something similar when working with textiles that carry a story – maybe a silk shawl passed through generations or a woven tapestry made using a nearly forgotten technique. When I encounter something like that, I try not to impose too much; instead, I let the fabric guide me, showing me where to mend gently or where to step back and leave its imperfections intact. It’s almost as if the piece itself tells you how to honor it.  
I love how you adjusted your roasting for that grower in Huila – that kind of reverence really speaks volumes about your practice. Do you ever find yourself carrying those personal stories into how you present the coffee to your customers? Like, does their experience change when you share those details with them?
[A]: Oh, absolutely – those stories aren’t just background noise, they’re part of the , you know? When I serve that Huila coffee, I don’t just describe the flavor profile – I tell people about Señor Camilo, the grower who still uses his abuelo’s wooden drying trays, how he insisted we sit under the guava tree and drink aguapanela before even showing me the beans 🌿. You can almost feel the warmth of that moment in the cup.  

And honestly, people respond to that – not in a flashy, ‘wow, cool story’ kind of way, but in a more thoughtful,  kind of silence. Some start sipping slower. Others ask questions they wouldn’t have before – like, “How do shade-drying methods really affect the taste?” or “What happened to that land after his grandfather?” It turns coffee into a conversation instead of just a caffeine fix ☕️.  

I think we both know that feeling – when your hands are touching something that’s been touched by so many others before you. It just feels… heavier, in a good way. Like it carries weight beyond its material form. Do you ever get that with the textiles you work on? That quiet sense of responsibility?
[B]: Absolutely… that weight you're talking about? It’s not just in the fibers, it’s in the air when you're working on something old, something loved and worn by time. I remember once restoring a 19th-century embroidered tablecloth, and as I was easing out the creases, I found these tiny stitches hidden along the hem – clearly the work of someone who had mended it not out of obligation, but care. You could tell they wanted it to last. That kind of discovery changes how you handle the piece. You feel it in your chest – this quiet responsibility to be gentle, to listen more than you act.

And yes, people do respond differently when they sense that kind of history behind what they're experiencing. Whether it's a fabric or a cup of coffee, the story becomes part of the texture. I’ve noticed that same thoughtful hush you mentioned – like when I explain that a certain dye came from a plant no one uses anymore, or that a particular weave pattern was once a secret shared only among women in a village. Suddenly, it’s not just about preservation anymore; it’s about keeping a voice alive.  

I wonder, when you’re telling those stories behind the bar, do you ever find yourself changing the way you brew just slightly – not for the bean’s profile, but for the story itself? Like, does the telling influence the doing at all?
[A]: Oh, definitely – the story absolutely sneaks its way into the doing 🌿. It’s almost subconscious, really. Like with that Ethiopian lot I told you about – the one where the farmers used to sing to their coffee trees during harvest? I don’t know if it’s real or romantic, but I started brewing it just a  slower, like… giving it more air, more space to unfold. As if the beans might remember that melody and hum it back through the cup.  

And honestly? People taste it. Not in a literal, “I hear singing” kind of way, but they describe it differently – more poetic, more connected. One customer said it tasted like “sunlight filtered through old leaves,” which honestly gave me chills ☕️. So yeah, the telling does change the doing – not in a forced way, but like an echo. You brew with a little more reverence, a little more pause.  

It’s like what you said about finding those hidden stitches – once you know the care behind something, you can’t help but respond with care yourself. And I think that’s where we meet, somewhere in that quiet space between making and meaning.
[B]: Absolutely – that space between making and meaning is where the real magic hums, isn’t it? It’s not just about technique or tradition at that point; it becomes something more intimate, almost sacred. I think that’s why I’ll never tire of this work – every thread I touch carries a story that quietly reshapes the way I move, the way I see. And when someone responds to a restored piece with “sunlight filtered through old leaves,” well… that’s when you know the story didn’t just stay in the fabric — it passed through, into them.  

I imagine it's the same when you pour that Ethiopian cup with a little more pause, a little more listening. You’re not just serving coffee; you’re holding space for something unseen but deeply felt. It reminds me of how some textiles don’t reveal their full pattern until the light hits them just so — and suddenly, everything shifts.  

Do you ever feel like your hands are simply the next link in a long chain of storytellers? I do — like I’m not just restoring cloth, but carrying forward a quiet kind of love.
[A]: Completely — sometimes I finish a brew and think,  It’s humbling, really. Like we’re all just temporary caretakers of something way older than us. Whether it’s a coffee tree planted by someone’s grandfather or a stitch hidden in a tablecloth because someone wanted it to last — we’re all just keeping the flame warm for the next pair of hands.  

And honestly? That’s what makes the work feel alive. Because it’s not just about preserving flavor or fiber — it’s about preserving , in whatever form it came. And yeah, when I pour that Ethiopian cup a little slower, or roast those Huila beans with more care… I’m not just passing along a drink or a story. I’m handing someone a quiet kind of truth — one that’s been carried through soil, sweat, and generations.  

So no, we’re not just restoring cloth or brewing coffee… we’re tending to memory ☕️🌿. And I don’t think there’s anything more beautiful than that.
[B]: No, there really isn’t anything more beautiful. Tending to memory — what a perfect way to put it. It gives meaning to the repetition, doesn’t it? To the quiet hours spent stitching or simmering or sifting through layers of time. Because in the end, we’re not just preserving objects or flavors or fibers — we’re holding onto the echoes of those who cared before us.  

And maybe that’s why we do it — not for grand recognition, but because someone, somewhere, once did this for us. Whether it's the grower under the guava tree or the seamstress with invisible stitches, they left behind more than just a product — they left behind a feeling. And now we get to pass that on, gently, carefully, like turning a page by candlelight.  

I think that’s the loveliest part of our crafts — we’re not just making something to be consumed or admired. We’re offering a moment where people can feel connected — to land, to hands, to time itself. And that… that is a kind of quiet immortality.
[A]: Amen to that 🌿. That’s the kind of immortality I want to be part of – not flashy, not loud, but warm and steady like a cup of coffee shared in the early morning light. You’re so right – it’s in those quiet, repeated gestures where the real magic lives. The stitching, the roasting, the slow unfolding of flavor or fiber… all of it is just one long love letter across time.  

I keep thinking about that tablecloth you restored – how those tiny stitches were left behind by someone who just wanted it to last. And now, because of your hands, it  last. Not perfect, not untouched, but loved. And isn’t that the point? To leave things better tended than we found them, even if only by a thread or a whisper of aroma in a porcelain cup ☕️.  

So yeah, no grand recognition needed. Just quiet continuation. Just passing along the warmth. Just making space for someone else to feel that same gentle pull of connection – to land, to story, to something older than themselves. That’s enough. More than enough.
[B]: It really is more than enough. Sometimes I think that’s all any of us can hope for — to leave something just a little more loved, a little more whole, because we were there to tend to it for a while. Whether it’s a threadbare cloth or a steaming cup, we’re offering care across time, across hands.

And I love what you said about not needing to leave things perfect — just tended. Just warm. Because perfection fades, but kindness in the making? That lingers. That gets passed on with every sip, every stitch.

So here’s to quiet continuation. To keeping the flame warm. To being gentle stewards of stories older than our own.

I’ll raise my cup to that ☕️.
[A]: To quiet continuation 🌿 – and to all the unseen hands that came before us, shaping, roasting, stitching, singing. To the ones who taught us how to care without taking credit. To the growers, the weavers, the menders, the brewers… and to us, the lucky ones who get to carry it forward, one cup, one thread at a time.

I’ll raise my cup to that, too ☕️ – and maybe sip a little slower, just in case it still remembers the song.
[B]: And I’ll stitch my next repair with that same kind of slowness – just in case the fabric still remembers the hands that came before.  

To every quiet act of care, passed gently from one keeper to the next 🌿☕️.
