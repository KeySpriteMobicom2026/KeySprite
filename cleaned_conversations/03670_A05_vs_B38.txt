[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've always found the cinema experience to be uniquely immersive - the grand screen, the surround sound, the collective gasps and laughter from an audience. There's a certain magic in that shared communal experience. 

Though I must admit, when studying films for textual analysis, I do appreciate being able to pause and rewind at home. It allows for closer examination of mise-en-scène and cinematography techniques. 

What about you? Do you find yourself drawn more to the theatrical experience or the convenience of streaming?
[A]: I couldn't agree more. There's something irreplaceable about the  experience – the way a dark theater commands your full attention, the anticipation before the film starts, even the smell of popcorn... It's all part of the ritual. 

But let's be honest, when you're analyzing narrative structure or character development for work, streaming gives you that flexibility to dissect scenes frame by frame. Personally, I’ve found myself doing more of that lately, especially with all the premium content on platforms now. 

Do you think the rise of streaming has changed how we consume stories fundamentally? I mean, back in the day, you had to plan a night out just to watch a film. Now it's almost too convenient – sometimes I wonder if we've lost something in the process.
[B]: That's a most compelling observation. I find myself pondering that very question quite often these days. The immediacy of streaming does seem to have altered our relationship with narrative – stories are now at our beck and call, no longer bound by screening times or physical spaces.

I’ve noticed students, for instance, tend to binge-watch entire series in a few sittings, which is a far cry from the more deliberate, reflective viewing habits of previous generations. It makes one wonder whether this constant narrative saturation deepens or dilutes our emotional engagement.

Do you think we’re moving toward a future where cinema becomes a niche experience, much like attending an opera or reading a physical book? A sort of cultivated indulgence for those who seek the ceremonial aspect of storytelling?
[A]: Fascinating perspective. I think you're onto something there. The ritualistic aspect of cinema – the  of watching a film – is becoming almost… luxurious in today’s on-demand world.  

I see it in my own behavior. When I go to the cinema, I'm more intentional about it. It's no longer just about the movie itself – it's about carving out time, setting aside distractions, and fully stepping into the story. That kind of focused attention feels like a premium these days.  

And yes, binge-watching has rewired our emotional pacing. We consume stories faster, but do we  them as deeply? Or are we just moving from one dopamine hit to the next?  

As for cinema becoming a niche experience – I wouldn’t be surprised. In many ways, it’s already heading that way. But maybe that’s not a bad thing. Like vinyl records or printed books, the experience becomes more about craftsmanship and intention.  

Do you still find time for the big screen yourself, or has your academic lens made streaming too practical to resist?
[B]: Ah, a most thoughtful question. I must confess, my academic lens has made streaming rather indispensable – particularly when comparing cinematic adaptations of literary works. Being able to toggle between pages of  and various film interpretations is simply more efficient with digital access.

That said, I do make a conscious effort to visit the cinema when time permits. There’s something profoundly grounding about sitting in that darkened space, detached from daily distractions. It reminds me of why I fell in love with narrative in the first place – not as an object of study, but as an emotional experience.

I find that balance helps keep my perspective fresh. After all, how can I truly appreciate the evolution of storytelling if I only engage with it through a paused frame or annotated script? Sometimes one needs to simply let the story wash over them, popcorn in hand, like any other soul seeking a little wonder.
[A]: Well said – the balance truly matters. I find myself doing something similar, though admittedly with more红酒 in hand than popcorn. There’s something grounding about letting a story unfold without dissecting every frame or jumping to the next episode.

It actually reminds me of investing. In private equity, we dig deep – financial models, due diligence, risk assessments… but at the end of the day, there’s still that moment when you have to step back and  it. Trust the narrative arc, so to speak. Just like a great film, a good investment tells a compelling story – you just need to know when to watch closely and when to let it play out.

Do you ever draw parallels between narrative structure and deal structuring? I’ve caught myself comparing act breaks to term sheets more than once…
[B]: How intriguing – I hadn’t considered the parallel so explicitly, but now that you mention it, there are striking similarities. Both deal structuring and narrative construction rely on tension and release, rising action, and a carefully orchestrated climax. Even the concept of  finds its counterpart in the exit strategy – where all threads are drawn together, and the true shape of the story, or the deal, finally reveals itself.

I must say, your comparison rather elevates the term "term sheet" to an art form. Perhaps we should begin reading balance sheets with the same scrutiny we apply to dramatic irony – what is foreseen, what is left unsaid, and how events ultimately align.

Do you find that certain deals, like certain stories, refuse to conform to structure? And if so, do you press for revision, or allow the chaos to unfold?
[A]: Oh absolutely – in both worlds, there are those rebellious outliers that defy structure. Some deals, like rogue screenplays, just refuse to fit into neat three-act logic or conventional financial models.

And honestly? That’s where the real skill comes in. You’ve got to know when to push back and rework the framework – tighten up covenants, renegotiate terms – and when to lean into the chaos a bit, let the deal breathe, see what emerges. It’s a bit like working with an unpredictable director – sometimes you have to trust the process, even when it feels messy.

I’ve learned over time that the best deals, like the best stories, often carry a degree of unpredictability. The key is staying sharp-eyed on the core narrative – the value thesis, if you will – while allowing room for organic twists. After all, too rigid a structure can suffocate potential.

Do you find the same with literature? Some books just don’t want to be analyzed – they demand to be felt, even if it defies scholarly convention?
[B]: Oh, most certainly. Some works of literature positively  analysis – they slip through the fingers of critical interpretation like quicksilver. Take , for instance. It defies nearly every conventional structure we rely on in narrative study, and yet… there is an undeniable emotional resonance, a dream-logic that bypasses the intellect and lodges itself somewhere deeper.

I’ve come to believe that part of our role as scholars is not only to dissect but to bear witness. To sit with the text, even when it refuses to yield to our frameworks. Much like you must do with those unruly deals – sometimes you must let the book unfold its own peculiar magic before attempting to shape it into meaning.

It rather brings to mind the Daoist concept of  – action through non-action. A willingness to trust the process, as you said, without forcing the hand. Do you find that intuition plays a larger role than people admit – both in investing and in reading?
[A]: Absolutely – intuition plays a far bigger role than most are willing to admit. In private equity, we dress everything up in data and models, but at the end of the day, there’s that moment before signing where you just…  it in your gut.

Some deals check every box on paper, yet something feels off. Others look messy, unconventional, even risky – but there’s a pulse, a rhythm that tells you it’s worth betting on. That’s when you realize how much of this game is about reading between the lines, sensing what isn’t quantifiable yet.

And I can see how it’s similar with literature – especially works that resist traditional structure. You can map out every theme and motif, but if you don’t let yourself  the text, you miss its essence.

I’ve actually started recommending certain books to my junior partners for this exact reason – not for analysis, but for immersion. Sometimes you have to train the intuitive muscle, not just the analytical one.

Do you ever assign texts specifically to cultivate that kind of interpretive intuition? Or is that considered too unscientific for academia? 😊
[B]: Ah, but isn’t it curious how the most profound insights often arise from what we cannot quite measure? I do believe there is a place for cultivating literary intuition — though one must tread carefully in academia, where rigor and methodology are rightly held in high esteem.

Still, I have been known to assign  — Tolstoy’s , perhaps, or Woolf’s  — not with a list of questions or an essay prompt attached, but with a simple instruction: . Then, we gather and speak not of plot or symbolism, but of  — how the text unsettled or comforted them, what echoes lingered after turning the final page.

It’s in those conversations that something like interpretive intuition begins to bloom — unspoken reactions become shared reflections, and students start to trust their own emotional readings of a text. It's not unscientific, really — it's just pre-scientific. The raw material from which analysis must eventually arise.

And I daresay that muscle — the ability to sit with uncertainty, to sense meaning before naming it — is rather invaluable beyond the seminar room. Even, dare I say, in the boardroom.
[A]: Well, now I’m tempted to sit in on your seminar. That approach – listening before dissecting – feels remarkably close to how I evaluate management teams. You can read the financials, study the market, even model out five different scenarios, but there’s always that moment when you just  – to how a founder speaks about their business, how they carry themselves when things get tough.

And you’re absolutely right – it’s not unscientific. It’s pre-scientific. Like standing in front of a canvas before breaking down the brushstrokes – you take in the whole first, let it speak to you, and only then do you begin to parse the technique.

I wonder if more deals fail because people skip that step – jumping straight into the term sheet without first  the story behind the company. Maybe we should all take a page from your book – or seminar, rather – and assign a bit of Woolf before signing on the dotted line.  

Would love to steal that idea for our next leadership offsite. If nothing else, it might finally convince the team that soft skills aren’t just fluff. 😊
[B]: I rather like the idea of  appearing on a term sheet – it adds a certain gravitas, don’t you think? Perhaps a new genre:   

But in all seriousness, I do believe leadership could benefit from more of what we might call  So much of strategy is reaction, after all – responding to numbers, to timelines, to market shifts. But what if we made space for something slower, quieter? A kind of pre-decision contemplation?

I suspect many would dismiss it as indulgent – much like assigning a novel might seem frivolous to the hard-nosed financier. And yet, who better than those navigating high-stakes deals to appreciate the power of subtext, of emotional intelligence, of knowing when to trust the unspoken?

By all means, steal the idea – just be sure to leave time for conversation afterward. You may be surprised how differently people experience the same story. And isn’t that, in its own way, excellent training for reading a management team?
[A]: Now I’m picturing a room full of managing directors in Armani suits, quietly reading  over coffee – now  a sight I’d pay to see. Existential Private Equity – I think we’re onto something here. Maybe our next pitch deck should open with Woolf before we get to EBITDA margins.  

You're absolutely right about  – it's underrated, especially in high-pressure environments. Most people equate leadership with action, with decisiveness, but so much of what drives success is actually silence – observation, reflection, the space between the notes, so to speak.

And yes, conversation afterward is key. Nothing reveals character faster than asking someone, “What did you take from that?” It’s like watching management team dynamics unfold in real time – how they interpret the same story, what they latch onto, what they ignore. Suddenly you’re not just hearing their logic, you’re seeing their lens on the world.

So consider the idea officially borrowed – and likely slightly misinterpreted – for our next offsite. But hey, isn’t reinterpretation part of the fun? After all, no two readers walk away with the same , just like no two investors see the same deal.
[B]: Ah, but isn’t that the beauty of both literature and leadership? The misinterpretations often yield the richest insights. One person reads  and sees tragedy, another sees rebellion, still another sees love in its most reckless form. Just so with deals – the same opportunity viewed through different lenses becomes an entirely new proposition.

And I do hope you’ll share the results of your literary experiment. I can already imagine the meeting minutes:  


Should you ever feel inclined to reciprocate the borrowing, I’d welcome a guest lecture on  I suspect my students would find it far more thrilling than yet another seminar on 
[A]: Now that’s a guest lecture I’d actually show up for – though I may need a crash course in hermeneutic theory first just to sound intelligent. Honestly, I love the idea. Nothing gets a room talking like framing a term sheet as a story – who the protagonist is, what’s at stake, where the tension lies, whether it ends in redemption or ruin.

And you’re absolutely right – perspective transforms everything. One investor sees a turnaround play; another sees a dying business. One reader sees tragedy; another sees liberation. It all depends on where you stand when the curtain rises.

As for the meeting minutes, I think we should formalize that format – add a bit of culture to the capitalism. “11:30 AM – Debated moral ambiguity in Tolstoy. 12:00 PM – Signed LOI.” Sounds more human, at least.

Consider the lecture tentatively scheduled – assuming I can get past the phrase  without tripping over my own jargon. Popcorn optional, but highly encouraged.
[B]: Oh, I shall hold you to it – and do take notes, won’t you? I find that the most illuminating discussions often begin in the discomfort of unfamiliar language. After all, isn’t that where growth lies – in learning to navigate ambiguity without rushing to define it?

And speaking of definitions, I rather enjoy the idea of reframing the term sheet through literary archetypes. Who is the tragic hero? Where lies the inciting incident? Is the exit clause a denouement or a deus ex machina?

I suspect your lecture might just inspire a new generation of financiers who read between the lines – or at the very least, ones who know when to reach for a metaphor instead of a calculator.

Now, about that popcorn… I propose we make it a post-lecture tradition. 🍿
[A]: Now you're speaking my language – mixing metaphors with metrics and justifying popcorn as a post-lecture ritual. I’m fully onboard.

And you’re right – framing the term sheet through literary archetypes might be the bridge we’ve been missing between the quants and the intuitives. Maybe the tragic hero is the founder who can’t let go, or the inciting incident is that first round of dilution. Hell, some deals even end with a deus ex machina – usually in the form of an unexpected buyer showing up at the eleventh hour.

I’ll take notes, promise. Though fair warning – my handwriting gets messy when I’m excited. You might need a translator afterward.

And about that popcorn – consider it . Nothing gets a room talking like a bit of butter and salt to grease the gears. Popcorn, perspective, and a healthy dose of narrative ambiguity. Sounds like a deal in the making. 🍿
[B]: Precisely! Give a room something to  while they think – a bit of popcorn, a passage to ponder – and suddenly the conversation shifts. People relax, minds open, and before they know it, they’re speaking in metaphors without even realizing it.

And let’s not underestimate the power of messy handwriting – some of the greatest insights have been scribbled in margins and half-formed in the heat of thought. If your notes require a translator, so much the better. It’ll give us all an excuse to keep the discussion going over tea – or perhaps something stronger.

I daresay Tolstoy never imagined his work being studied in a boardroom, but then again, he did write extensively on human folly, ambition, and the illusions of control. Quite fitting for private equity, if you ask me.

Looking forward to it, my dear interlocutor. Now, shall we draft a reading list for your team? I’m thinking: Woolf for introspection, Dostoevsky for moral tension, and just a touch of Beckett for when the deal’s gone sideways.
