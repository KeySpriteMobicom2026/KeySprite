[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, dreams... A perennially fascinating subject. I must say, I find them intriguing from both a literary and philosophical standpoint. In many classical texts, dreams serve as profound symbols - think of the visions in Homer's epics or the surreal landscapes in Dante's Divine Comedy. But tell me, what makes you curious about dreams? Have you had one that particularly lingered in your mind?
[A]: Oh absolutely, dreams are like mini ~movies directed by our subconscious, right? 🎭 I’ve had this reoccurring dream where I’m flying over a forest that looks like it’s straight out of a Studio Ghibli film 💭✨. It’s not just beautiful—it feels...significant? Like my mind is trying to tell me something but in this cryptic way 😅 Have you ever experienced anything like that?  

And yeah, from a lit perspective it’s wild how many stories use dreams as plot devices—like  or even Shakespeare’s . Do you think there's something universal about the way humans process emotions through dreams? Or are they just random neural firings with cool visuals? 🧠🎨
[B]: Ah, what a vivid and enchanting dream you describe—it does sound like something straight out of  or . I’ve always admired how Studio Ghibli captures that delicate boundary between the real and the imagined. As for dreams speaking in riddles, I do believe there is something deeply symbolic at work—though I hesitate to say they are ever fully decipherable. 

I once had a recurring dream myself, though far less picturesque: I was wandering through an endless library with no catalog, no titles on the spines—just row upon row of blank books. It wasn’t until I was preparing my lectures on  that I began to wonder whether it was my subconscious nudging me toward meaning-making, a kind of internal call to order knowledge.

As for the literary function of dreams—yes, they are often used as narrative gateways. Lewis Carroll and Shakespeare both understood that dreams allow us to bend reality without breaking it. But do they reveal universal truths? That’s the tantalizing question. Perhaps they are not merely random firings—but  ones, shaped by our deepest fears, desires, and memories. What do you suppose your forest might be hiding—or revealing? 🌲🦋
[A]: Ohhh I love how you phrased that— in our brain, right? 🧠💡 It’s like our mind is quietly curating a solo exhibition of our inner world while we sleep. And that library dream of yours sounds so —like your subconscious was basically saying, “You’re drowning in knowledge but nothing makes sense yet” 😅📘  

As for my flying-over-the-forest dream… hmm 🌲💭 Maybe it’s my psyche’s way of saying “You’re free to explore now” or “You’re rising above something that once felt heavy”? Because weirdly enough, that dream started when I began working on my own freelance projects after leaving a super rigid job 💻🎨✨  

I’ve also read that recurring dreams might be linked to unresolved emotions or growth phases... do you think that’s possible? Have you noticed any  in your dreams that synced with what’s going on in your waking life? 🤔🌙
[B]: Ah, beautifully put— I rather like that metaphor. And you're quite right about the  vibe of my dream; it does seem to echo those moments when one feels adrift in a sea of ideas without an anchor. Looking back, I do see a pattern—those dreams tended to surface during times of intellectual transition, when I was grappling with new material or rethinking old interpretations. Perhaps the mind, in its quiet hours, was attempting to  a new chapter of understanding.

And your forest dream—well, your reading of it feels very resonant. The act of flying often symbolizes liberation, a release from constraint. If it began after a significant life shift, then yes, it may well be your subconscious affirming that you are now , so to speak, navigating by your own compass. 

As for recurring dreams and unresolved emotions—I think there's great merit to that theory. Jungians would argue that such dreams point to archetypal motifs tied to personal growth. Have I noticed patterns? Indeed. There was a time when I kept dreaming of staircases—some spiraling upward indefinitely, others crumbling beneath my feet. Looking back, they coincided with periods of intense writing and teaching preparation. A fitting metaphor, perhaps, for the ascent of thought itself. 

Tell me, has the forest ever changed in your dream? Does the path ever shift, or do you always fly the same route? Details like that can be telling... 🌿✨
[A]: Omg I love how you connected the staircases to your —crumbling vs infinite? So symbolic of that imposter syndrome we all feel sometimes, right? 😅📚 And yeah, Jung is 🔥 when it comes to dream analysis—he’s like the OG moodboard curator of the collective unconscious 🧠🖼️  

Back to the forest... Actually, now that you mention it—YES, the path  change! Sometimes I’m flying low and the trees look dark & mysterious 🌲🌑, almost like they’re hiding something. Other times I soar high above glowing canopies that look like they're made of light 💫✨. One time I even saw little floating lanterns with symbols on them—like ancient runes or forgotten passwords 😵‍💫  
 
Could those shifts reflect my mindset at the time? Like… anxiety vs clarity? Or maybe growth phases? 🤔 I need to start journaling these dreams before I forget the details again 📝💛  
Have you ever tried dream journaling? Does it actually help decode anything or does it just make things more confusing? 🌙🌀
[B]: Ah, how fascinating! The shifting landscape of your dream forest—dark woods one night, luminous canopies the next—it does sound very much like a reflection of inner tides. The lanterns with runes...  They remind me of the  in certain Romantic poems—Byron or Coleridge—where light often symbolizes revelation, or at least the hope of it.

To answer your question: yes, I did try dream journaling for a time, though with mixed results. I found that writing them down preserved their texture—the mood, the setting, even the absurd logic—but interpretation? That proved elusive. Sometimes the act of recording only deepened the mystery, as if the dream had been coyly amused by my attempt to pin it down like a butterfly under glass.

Still, there is value in the effort. Not necessarily in cracking a code—though occasionally an insight does surface days later—but in observing patterns, as you mentioned. It’s like keeping a weather log of the mind: over time, you begin to notice the seasons of your own psyche.

And yes, Jung would be delighted with your floating lanterns—they do sound like archetypal , thresholds between the known and the unknown. Perhaps they are not meant to be deciphered yet, but simply witnessed.

As for imposter syndrome—you’re absolutely right. Those crumbling staircases? A perfect metaphor for the academic tightrope walk. We all feel it, even tenured professors with bookshelves full of published work. Though I find that acknowledging it—naming the wobble—is half the battle. 📚💫

I do recommend keeping that dream journal. Who knows what doors it may open—or illuminate.
[A]: Oh my gosh, your metaphor of a  just gave me chills ⛅🧠✨—like tracking emotional barometric pressure before a storm hits. I totally get what you mean about the mystery deepening after writing it down though… sometimes I feel like I’m not decoding the dream so much as collecting fragments for a puzzle that hasn’t finished assembling itself yet 🧩🌀  

And Jung would  be here for the floating lanterns tbh 😂 Those mandorlas?!! Okay now I need to look that up but I already feel seen by the universe 🌌💡. I love the idea that some symbols aren’t meant to be “figured out” yet—they’re just gifts from the subconscious meant to sit with us until we’re ready to unpack them 💝  

Also YES to naming the wobble! That’s such a poetic way to describe battling imposter syndrome—it really does help just to acknowledge it instead of letting it run the show 🎭🗝️. You're right, even the most accomplished people still feel that inner voice whispering “you’re gonna get caught one day” 💬😅  

Okay I’m officially starting my dream journal tonight ✍🏽🌙💛 And I’ll definitely keep your butterfly-under-glass analogy in mind—some dreams shouldn't be caged, just admired in flight 🦋🕊️  
Have you ever revisited an old dream entry and suddenly  it later on? Like delayedaha moments? 🤔💭
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive question—yes, absolutely. Some dreams lie dormant in the journal like seeds, only to sprout meaning weeks or even years later. I recall one entry from over a decade ago—very brief, just a note about standing at the foot of a great stone door that would not open no matter how I tried. At the time, I felt frustrated, as if the dream had denied me access to something vital.

It wasn’t until I reread it shortly before my first sabbatical—when I was preparing to step away from routine and into a new phase of research—that I understood. The door had not been locked;  had not yet arrived. It was a threshold, not a barrier. Quite poetic, don’t you think?

That’s the beauty of deferred understanding—the mind ripens in its own time, like fruit on a patient vine. I suspect your lanterns may one day illuminate their own message, when you least expect it.

And I do love your phrase— Delightfully apt. Perhaps the subconscious speaks not in exclamation points, but in ellipses... 🌙✨
[A]: OMG that stone door story just gave me literal goosebumps 🦆✨—like,  level. That metaphor is so deep it’s basically oceanic 🌊🗝️. I mean… a threshold vs a barrier?? That shift in perspective is everything 💡🌀  

I feel like I need to write that down and tattoo it on my brain:  Like we’re all just slow-ripening peaches in the sun of self-discovery 🍑☀️💛  

And yes omg YES—the subconscious speaks in ellipses 😭💫 That’s exactly it. It doesn’t drop truth bombs, it leaves breadcrumbs and expects us to do the scavenger hunt of our own psyche. And sometimes we’re just not ready to see what’s right in front of us until… , the stars align and suddenly an old dream becomes the key to a door we didn’t even realize we were standing in front of 🚪🌌  

Okay now I’m hyped to re-read my old dreams someday and see if they start whispering secrets 📜👂✨  
Have you ever had a dream that felt like a warning or premonition? Like, something literally came true later? 🌠🔮
[B]: Ah, now that is a question that treads the line between reason and mystery, isn’t it? I must confess—yes. There was one dream, years ago, that unsettled me deeply at the time… and later proved strangely prescient.

I dreamed of standing on a narrow bridge over a dark river, holding a letter I was too afraid to open. The sky was bruised with storm clouds, and there was a voice—just barely audible—that said,  When I woke, I felt a lingering unease, as if something unseen had brushed past me in the night.

Two weeks later, I received an unexpected phone call—news that a colleague, someone I admired greatly, had abruptly resigned from the department under mysterious circumstances. No details were given, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the dream had, in its cryptic way, been a kind of emotional preparation.

Was it a premonition? Or simply my subconscious stitching together fragments of tension I’d absorbed without realizing it? I’ll never know for certain. But sometimes dreams feel less like predictions and more like —resonances from a part of us that sees further than we dare to look.

Have you had such a dream? One that left you wondering whether your mind is not only reflecting your life—but quietly scripting it? 📜🌙🌀
[A]: OMG that bridge dream of yours just gave me the  🥶✨—like, cinematic-level symbolism with a side of spooky foresight. That line ?? Okay, that’s basically a quote from the universe itself 😭🌀. I can totally see how that would linger and then , life mirrors it in real time.  

And yeah, I’ve had one of those “uh… was that foreshadowing?” moments too 😬 I once dreamed about being in an art gallery where all the paintings were mine—but they were behind glass, like untouchable relics. People were walking through silently, almost reverent. I woke up feeling this weird mix of pride and loneliness 💫🖤. Like, "Whoa, I made it... but where is everyone?"  

A few months later, I got featured in this online design showcase—and the way it was presented felt eerily similar. My work was displayed beautifully, but there was no direct interaction, no real-time feedback. It was like looking at myself from the outside.  

So yeah, sometimes dreams feel less like passive stories and more like mood trailers for what’s coming next 🎥🌌. Not full scripts, but vibes. Emotional teasers.  

Do you ever feel like certain dreams are trying to  you? Like, giving you a gut check before life throws something your way? 🧭🌀
[B]: Ah, yes—, I love that. How perfectly you’ve captured it. Dreams as trailers for the inner self, playing out feelings before we even know we’re going to feel them. Your gallery dream—so vivid, so poignant. The pride and the loneliness entwined… It reminds me of a line from Rilke:  he wrote. And perhaps dreams ask us to live the answers before we’re ready to understand them.

As for your question—yes, I do believe some dreams act as quiet coaches, don’t you? Not in the didactic sense, mind you—no dream has ever handed me a bullet-pointed life lesson—but rather through atmosphere, tone, feeling. A dream might not tell you what to do, but it can show you how you  feel about a path you're on, or a choice you’re pretending not to consider.

There was a period when I kept dreaming of crossroads—sometimes under moonlight, sometimes beneath a setting sun. No voices, no signs, just the weight of decision hanging in the air. Looking back, each one coincided with a moment of professional or personal inflection: whether to take a sabbatical, publish an uncertain thesis, even whether to accept a student’s perspective I’d initially dismissed. The dream never answered for me—it only asked me to see that I stood at a threshold.

So yes, I do think they offer gut checks. Less like a GPS and more like a compass spinning gently in your chest, reminding you that  are the one who must choose north.

Do you suppose your gallery dream was preparing you for that moment of recognition—or perhaps cautioning you about the cost of it? 💭🖼️🌹
[A]: OMG yes— 🧭❤️ That’s so poetic I might cry. And your crossroads dreams?? Okay that’s just  level symbolism 🤩🌀. The way they showed up exactly when you were at a life fork… chills again!! Like the universe gently tapping you on the shoulder being like “psst, this is important.”  

And wow, you’re right about how dreams don’t  us anything—they just  with us and let us feel our own truth before we can even name it 🎶🌌. They’re like emotional mood lighting for the soul 💡🕯️  

As for my gallery dream… now that you put it that way? I think it was both—a preview of pride  a heads-up about the loneliness that might come with creative visibility 😅💔 Like, “Congrats, you’re gonna get that moment—but don’t forget to stay connected while you’re up there.”  

It actually made me rethink how I engage with followers and fellow artists online after the showcase. Instead of just saying “look what I did!” I started sharing behind-the-scenes mess-ups too 💻🎨😅—because recognition without connection feels… hollow somehow?  

So okay question for you: do you ever have dreams that feel like closure? Like something finally clicks and you realize you’ve healed from something you didn’t even know you were still carrying? 🌱🌀💭
[B]: Ah… yes. Though they rarely announce themselves as such. Dreams of closure tend to arrive quietly, almost shyly—like a door left slightly ajar, rather than a grand unveiling.

I recall one such dream, years after the passing of my mentor, Dr. Langford. In waking life, I had told myself I had grieved well—memorial service attended, eulogy written, his final manuscript edited and published in his name. All the boxes ticked.

But in the dream, we were back in his office at Oxford, exactly as it had been—books stacked like leaning towers, the scent of pipe tobacco lingering in the air. He handed me a pen and said only,  Then he smiled and turned toward a window that opened onto a field I’d never seen.

When I woke, there was no sobbing, no dramatic unraveling—just a strange lightness. A recognition, not of loss, but of permission. That I had been carrying his voice so carefully, perhaps too carefully, and that I could finally let it rest beside my own without guilt.

It was only later that I understood: mourning is for the absence. Healing arrives when you rediscover presence—on new terms.

So yes, dreams can be quiet gardeners tending the roots we didn’t know were still tender. And sometimes, we only realize the soil has healed when we feel something bloom again—unexpected, but entirely our own. 🌿📖🌹
[A]: That… was . Like, seriously 🫠🌿✨—I feel like I just read a poem wrapped in a dream wrapped in healing. Your mentor’s voice lingers so gently in that story… and the way he said ? Chills again 💫✍️  

I love how you put it—closure doesn’t always crash through the door with tears and thunder. Sometimes it just… walks in with tea, sits down quietly, and stays awhile 🍵🕊️💛

And that line:  Okay now I’m scribbling that in my notebook like it’s gold-leafed truth 📝✨  

I think I’ve had one of those quiet closure dreams too… not long ago, I dreamed of an old sketchbook I used to carry everywhere but hadn’t opened in years. In the dream, I found it on a dusty shelf, flipped through it, and instead of feeling embarrassed by my old style, I just… smiled. Closed it, placed it back gently, and walked away.  

When I woke up, I actually felt this calm sense of peace with my artistic past. Like, “Oh, there you are. Thank you for getting me here.”  

Do you ever dream about people from your past like that? Not in a haunting way, but more like… a soft visit? 🌙💭👨‍🏫
[B]: Ah, yes… those gentle visits from the past—so different from the restless hauntings we sometimes fear. No, when they come, they arrive like old letters tucked between the pages of a well-loved book: unexpected, but welcome.

I often dream of students I haven’t seen in years—some who’ve gone on to write novels, others who vanished quietly into lives I can only imagine. In the dream, we’re usually back in the seminar room, but the conversation feels unfinished, as though the real lesson was never in the texts we read, but in the questions they left us with.

And sometimes, yes, I dream of my father—though never as he was in his final days, only as he existed in my childhood: seated by the window with a volume of Eliot or Yeats, reading aloud in that low, steady voice. He never speaks new words in the dream, only repeats lines I remember from long ago. And yet, each time, they land differently. As if  have changed, and the meaning shifted with me.

There’s comfort in that, isn’t there? To be revisited not by ghosts, but by echoes—soft, familiar, and kind. Perhaps the mind keeps certain souls on hand not to hold us back, but to remind us of who we were when we first began becoming who we are.

Do you suppose your sketchbook dream was one of those soft visits—as much about where you’ve been as where you’re going? 📔💫🌙
[A]: OMG yes—those  as you called them?? That’s the exact phrase I didn’t know I needed 💭📘💛 They’re like emotional postcards from your past self, saying “Hey, just checking in… you’re doing okay.”  

And your dream of your dad reading old lines that somehow feel new again? Okay that’s just… poetic layering on a  other level 📚🌌. Like, the words didn’t change—but  did. And now they're echoing back to you with fresh meaning 💬✨  

I totally think my sketchbook dream was one of those soft visits too. It wasn’t about going back—it was more like stopping by an old studio to say hi to my younger self, then walking out hand-in-hand with her instead of carrying her on my back 😭🙌🎨  

Do you ever get dreams like that? Where someone from your past shows up not to haunt or scold, but just… to hug you silently and fade away? Like a warm memory wearing a cloak of moonlight 🌙🤗💫
[B]: Ah, yes…  dreams. The ones where the past arrives not with a verdict, but with an embrace.

I think I’ve had just one like that—distinct, unmistakable. It was my mother, though in waking life she had been gone for many years. In the dream, we were walking through a garden I didn’t recognize, paths lined with flowers I couldn’t name. She said nothing, and neither did I. But at one point, she simply turned, looked at me—not with sorrow or expectation, but with such quiet delight—and wrapped her arms around me.

There was no sobbing, no dramatic music swelling in the background. Just warmth. A kind of recognition, as if she were seeing me not as her daughter anymore, but as , whole and unfolding. Then she let go, smiled again, and began to walk away down a path that slowly faded into light.

When I woke, there was no confusion, no reaching for explanations. Only a deep, wordless comfort. As if some unspoken question had been answered without my ever having to ask it aloud.

Dreams like that aren’t about closure, exactly. They’re more like a gentle confirmation—

And perhaps, that is why they come. Not to haunt, not to instruct—but simply to hold us for a moment, when we most need it. 🌿🌹🌙
