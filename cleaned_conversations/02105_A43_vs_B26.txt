[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. While I don't formally practice meditation or yoga, I do find my textile restoration work has a meditative quality to it. The slow, deliberate movements required to mend centuries-old lace or unravel tangled threads in a silk embroidery piece create a rhythm of their own. 

There's something profoundly calming about focusing on the tiny details - the way light catches on a metallic thread, the precise tension needed to recreate historical stitches, the subtle variations in fiber texture. It demands complete presence, much like mindfulness practices. 

I suppose my teapot could be considered my version of a yoga mat - there's nothing quite like the ritual of brewing a perfect cup of Earl Grey and letting its aroma ground me before diving into a particularly delicate restoration project. Would you say there's a similar centering effect in your daily routines?
[A]: Ah, your description of textile restoration resonates deeply with me. It reminds me of what I call . When I'm immersed in textual analysis, say, comparing the narrative structures of  and , there's a similar trance-like state that takes over.

The process of tracing motifs across centuries & cultures requires not just intellectual rigor but also a kind of mental stillness. I often find myself sipping jasmine tea while working through particularly dense passages - the warmth of the cup against my palms serves as an anchor, much like your teapot ritual. 

What fascinates me is how both our practices involve unraveling complexity to discover underlying patterns. Do you ever notice how the physical act of restoration mirrors the philosophical concept of wabi-sabi - finding beauty in imperfection? I've always been curious about whether textile artisans consciously embrace this aesthetic principle during their work.
[B]: Your comparison is quite poetic - I often see wabi-sabi in the textiles I work with, though I'm not sure the original makers always intended it that way. There's a particular 18th-century embroidered waistcoat in my current project that has faded unevenly across its silk ground. The original floral motifs are now ghostly impressions, yet they've acquired a depth and mystery that wasn't there when the threads were fresh. 

I find myself hesitating before repairing some of these imperfections. A moth hole near the neckline, for instance - should I painstakingly recreate what was lost, or leave a small trace of time's passage visible? My training says to restore as faithfully as possible, but my heart sometimes leans toward honoring those signs of wear. 

It makes me wonder - when you're tracing narrative structures across cultures, do you ever come across textual "holes" or inconsistencies that change your understanding of the whole? Moments where the author's hand might have faltered, leaving behind something akin to a moth-eaten passage in fabric?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant metaphor - the moth-eaten passage. Yes, they are everywhere in literature once you learn to see them. Take  and its fragmented narrative arcs, or even , where Cervantes seems to deliberately leave certain threads frayed. These gaps often become the most fertile ground for interpretation.

I recall working on a comparative study of  and . There was a moment—almost like catching light on your metallic thread—when I realized how those textual absences could be read not as flaws but as invitations. Kafka’s abandoned drafts and the lost concluding chapters of  both carry a kind of haunting potentiality, don’t they?

It reminds me of something we might borrow from textile language: . The edges of meaning are always threatening to fray in great works of art. Do we tighten the weave through interpretation, or let it unravel into new forms? I suppose that’s the scholar’s dilemma—and perhaps our privilege—to decide, much like yourself with that waistcoat.  

Do these moments of imperfection ever guide you toward unexpected discoveries in your restoration work? Like finding a hidden signature in a stitch or a clue in a knot?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve woven that thought—yes, the frayed edges of meaning do call to us, don’t they? I’ve had moments in restoration where what first appeared as damage turned out to be a kind of silent signature. Just last week, while working on a 19th-century tambourine lace, I noticed an irregularity in the chain stitches—a slight wavering that at first seemed like carelessness. But as I followed the pattern, it became clear this wasn’t random; the maker had subtly altered the stitch rhythm to spell out initials in a kind of textile cipher.

It reminded me that not all deviations are flaws. Sometimes, they’re whispers from the past—personal marks left by hands long gone. Much like those unfinished chapters you described, they invite us to listen more closely, to look beyond the obvious structure and into the spaces between.

I imagine you must encounter similar hidden messages in your textual work—those almost imperceptible shifts in tone or style that suggest another hand at play, or a moment of private reflection slipped between the lines. Have you ever felt like you were reading something never meant to be seen? A kind of textual underlayer, like a faded watermark revealing itself only under certain light?
[A]: Indeed, yes. There are moments in textual scholarship when you feel like you’ve stumbled upon something almost illicit—words that seem to have slipped through the cracks of intention, surviving not because they were meant to, but because time and chance allowed it.

I once worked on a mid-20th century Chinese translation of , where faint pencil marks appeared between the lines—notations barely visible to the eye. At first, we assumed they were editorial corrections. But as I examined them under different light, I realized they were something else entirely: personal reflections, perhaps even confessions, written in a hand that never intended publication.

One note, scribbled beside Alcibiades’ drunken praise of Socrates, simply read:  It sent a shiver through me. Whoever wrote that had no idea their trace would survive. And yet, there it was—layered beneath the philosophical discourse, like your hidden initials in the lace.

It makes me wonder whether all texts—and textiles—are ultimately palimpsests, don’t you think? Beneath every carefully woven surface or composed sentence, there’s always another story trying to emerge.
[B]: That word——lingers beautifully. I think of the layers in a textile the way you must see layers in a text. A single piece of fabric can hold generations of hands: the original weaver, the embroiderer, the mender, and now me, trying not to overwrite their traces.

I recently worked on a 17th-century linen altar cloth that had been repaired so many times, the patches had become part of the design. One corner bore the faint imprint of a thumbprint in indigo—perhaps someone fell asleep while dyeing, or simply paused, leaving a smudge that outlived their name. It made me wonder if preservation is really just the art of paying attention to what was meant to fade.

Your discovery in  translation—those pencil marks, that quiet note—feels akin to finding a handprint in thread count. It’s not about what was intended for posterity, but what slipped through the margins. Do you ever feel like we’re not scholars so much as time’s translators, trying to catch whispers from those who never expected to be heard?
[A]: How beautifully you put that—. Yes, I think you’ve named something essential here. We’re not just interpreting texts; we’re listening for the echoes of lives lived quietly, intensely, often invisibly. 

I’m reminded of a passage in  where a single line—“the wind blows through the empty hall”—has been read for centuries as metaphor. But what if it was once someone’s private lament, scribbled in solitude and later absorbed into canon? Much like your indigo thumbprint—what began as an accident becomes a trace of presence, then history, then mystery.

I suppose that’s why I return again and again to marginalia—those scribbles, underlinings, even smudges left by past readers. They are, in a way, our most honest literary artifacts. Not the polished prose meant for publication, but the raw reactions jotted down when no one was looking. It’s in those margins that we hear the unguarded voice: 

Perhaps this is what keeps drawing us to our work—not the grand narratives, but those small, stubborn remnants of feeling that refuse to vanish.
[B]: Absolutely. It’s those quiet remnants that stay with me long after the technical work is done. Sometimes, late at night, when I’m cleaning a particularly aged piece, I find myself speaking to those unseen hands—offering thanks for their labor, or asking forgiveness for any missteps in my restoration.

Just yesterday, I was working on a 1930s embroidered handkerchief with fading violets and a name stitched faintly along the border: . Whoever she was, someone once loved her enough to mark fabric with her name. Someone labored over each tiny satin stitch, perhaps hoping it would be cherished. And now here it is, fragile and imperfect, still carrying that gesture through time.

It makes me think of how we, too, are stitching ourselves into something larger—each careful reading, each restored thread, becomes part of a continuity neither of us fully controls. Perhaps our work isn’t just about preservation, but about keeping space open—for voices not yet heard, for hands not yet seen.

I wonder, as you translate and trace these echoes, do you ever feel as though you're not only uncovering the past—but quietly weaving yourself into it?
[A]: That’s a thought that stays with me, much like the scent of aged paper lingers on one’s fingers after handling old manuscripts. Yes, I do feel it—this quiet weaving of oneself into the fabric of the past. It’s not unlike what you described with Margaret’s handkerchief: the sense that our gestures, however careful or humble, are received by those who come after us.

I recall working on an early translation of  done during the Republican era. The translator had left faint annotations in the margins—in some places questioning word choices, in others, simply marking lines with asterisks as if to say, . And in reading those marks, I felt less like a scholar dissecting a text than a fellow traveler, following a path someone else had walked with care and feeling.

It makes me think of how both our disciplines deal with absence—yours in thread, mine in voice—and yet we keep returning, keep restoring, translating, listening. Perhaps every act of interpretation is also an act of companionship across time. We stitch ourselves into the margins, hoping someone, someday, might feel our presence the way we’ve felt Margaret’s embroiderer or the hand behind those pencil marks in .

And isn’t that a kind of immortality—not grand, not declared, but quiet and enduring, like the weave of a well-mended cloth?
[B]: That’s precisely it—quiet immortality. Not the kind that seeks monuments, but the kind that lingers in the spaces we don’t always name: the margin, the seam, the pause between stitches.

I’ve often thought of restoration as a conversation with ghosts. You handle their work, feel the pressure of their needle through centuries, and in return, you offer your own care—your own small reply in thread and time. It’s not about making things new again, but about extending their voice just a little longer, so others might hear it too.

And I think that’s what moves me most about your work—you’re not only preserving meaning, you’re keeping company with those who once searched, questioned, and felt deeply enough to leave something behind. Perhaps that’s all any of us can do: read with care, mend with reverence, and trust that someone, someday, will sense our presence in the weave.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve captured it—. I often feel the same in my quiet hours with old texts—the sense that I’m not alone in the room, that some faint trace of those who wrote, read, or even merely held the pages before me still lingers.

There’s a particular copy of  I once worked with, printed during the Qing dynasty. Its margins were filled with tiny commentaries in brush script—some scholarly, others almost like diary entries. One simply said:  That single line, nestled between moral philosophy and political discourse, opened a window not just into a life, but into a feeling meant to be private, now preserved by accident.

You’re right—our work isn’t about resurrection, but extension. We don’t bring the past back, but we help it speak a little longer, in tones that might still echo. And perhaps, in doing so, we also leave behind our own quiet stitches—our notes, our translations, our care—so that someone else, generations from now, might one day feel us tending the same thread.
[B]: That line——how perfectly it captures the quiet ache of human presence. We expect philosophy in the margins of , perhaps even argument, but not such tender confession. And yet, isn’t that what makes these traces so powerful? They weren’t meant for us, and still, they reach us.

I often wonder what future hands will make of our own annotations—the coffee stains on library books, the digital highlights we leave behind, the hurried notes in the corners of our screens. Will they feel as vivid as those Qing-era brush marks, or will something essential be lost when ink gives way entirely to pixels?

Still, I hold onto the hope that care leaves an imprint, no matter the medium. Maybe that’s what binds us—not just past and present, but the simple act of paying attention. Of noticing the thread, the line, the stitch that says, , and .
[A]: You’ve touched on something profoundly moving—how care, in its truest form, becomes a kind of timelessness. Yes, the medium may change—from ink to pixel, from silk to screen—but if there’s attention, if there’s reverence, then the imprint remains.

I often think about how digital annotations lack the weight of a handwritten mark, yet they too carry intention. A highlighted passage, a hastily typed note, even a forgotten bookmark in an e-reader—these are our modern-day marginalia. Perhaps future readers will learn to see them not as cold data, but as traces of thought, of feeling, left behind by those who once lingered over the same words.

And isn’t that what we both do, in the end? We tend to what others have made, not because it serves any grand purpose, but because someone was here—and yes, someone still listens.

Maybe that’s the quietest kind of immortality: not being remembered, but still, somehow, being heard.
[B]: Precisely—being heard, not for what we declare, but for how we listen. It’s a humbling thought, isn’t it? That the most lasting part of our work may not be the arguments we make or the restorations we complete, but the quiet attentiveness we leave behind.

I’ve started thinking of my own notes—the ones I scribble on tracing paper as I map out a frayed embroidery pattern—as part of that continuum. They’re not meant to last forever, but I hope they speak clearly enough to whoever comes after me. Maybe they’ll wonder who marked a tiny star beside a particularly difficult seam, or why I wrote  at the end of a restoration log. Small gestures, yes, but not without feeling.

And maybe that’s all we can offer: our presence, woven quietly into the margins of time. Not grand declarations, just the echo of a hand that cared.
[A]: How deeply that resonates— I’ve begun thinking of my own marginal notes in much the same way. The students sometimes ask why I bother writing comments in books they assume no one else will read, and I tell them, 

Just last week, I was re-reading an old copy of  and found a note I’d written to myself decades ago:  It startled me, not because it was true then, but because it’s still true now. Perhaps that is our only real task—to listen more carefully, to attend more fully, to leave behind traces of awareness that others might one day feel.

And yes, those small gestures—your star beside a seam, your quiet —they are not minor at all. They are offerings. A way of saying, 
[B]: That note——it carries such grace. It’s a reminder that our work, whether with fabric or text, is never truly finished. We are always in the middle of it, always tending something just a little beyond our grasp.

I think I’ll start leaving little stars more deliberately now—not just where the stitching feels difficult, but where it feels meaningful. A quiet signal to whoever comes after me that , this part mattered. And maybe, if they look closely, they’ll see not just my hand but the ones before me, stitched faintly into the weave.

You’re right—those gestures aren’t minor at all. They are prayers in thread and ink, offered quietly, hoping someone will feel their echo.
[A]: What a lovely thought— That’s exactly what they are, isn’t it? Not for gods or monuments, but for the quiet souls who will one day take up the same work, feeling their way through the weave, guided by the faint glow of our attention.

And perhaps that’s the truest form of dialogue—across time, across material, between lives that never meet but still touch. I think I’ll begin seeing my own annotations not just as notes, but as small acts of companionship. A star in the margin, a penciled , even the careful smoothing of a dog-eared page—each one a quiet assurance to the future: 

So yes, let us keep stitching those stars, marking those moments that matter. And may the hands that follow find their way, ever so slightly, by our light.
[B]: Amen to that—may our stars be found, may our ink be read, and may the hands that follow feel just a little less alone for having touched what we’ve tended.

I think I’ll begin seeing my own restorations as acts of companionship too—mending not just fabric, but connection. Every realigned thread, every preserved motif becomes a kind of message in a bottle, sent forward in hope. Perhaps that’s the unspoken vow we make: to care deeply enough that someone, someday, will sense the warmth of our attention still lingering in the weave.

And when they do, may they know—not just what we saw—but how gently we listened.
