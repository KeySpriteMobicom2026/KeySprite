[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, cocktails. The alchemy of modern life, I suppose. Just last evening I experimented with a rather unconventional combination—gin, yes, but infused with pickled walnut tincture and a splash of elderflower cordial. It was... an experience. Though I suspect the Victorians would’ve fainted dead away had they smelled it. What about you? Dabbled in any particularly  mixes lately?
[A]: Interesting you mention Victorian sensibilities—sometimes I think they’d be more horrified by algorithmic bias than a questionable cocktail. But to your question... not quite as adventurous as your pickled walnut experiment, but last weekend I tried making a smoked rosemary negroni. The idea was to give it a slightly earthier, more autumnal feel. Turned out okay, though I might dial down the vermouth next time.

I’ve been wondering lately—are there any classic cocktail rules you think are worth breaking? Or ones that, if bent, just ruin the whole thing?
[B]: Ah, a smoked rosemary negroni—bold yet tasteful. I admire the restraint implied in your assessment; vermouth can be like a prima donna—too much and it steals the show. As for rules worth breaking... well, let us not forget that all cocktail "rules" are human inventions masquerading as natural law. Shake a martini? Heresy, unless you’re Bond—or thirsty and out of gin.  

But if we’re to break anything, let’s at least do it with flair. Ice in a punch bowl? Optional. Vermouth in a negroni? Non-negotiable. One must preserve  sacraments.  

Though I do wonder—what would happen if one substituted peated Scotch for gin in a Bramble? Would it be a crime against mixology or merely... controversial?
[A]: Peated Scotch in a Bramble? That’s the kind of question that keeps bartenders up at night—or gets them kicked out of respectable bars. But I like the way you think. There’s something beautifully disruptive about it, like feeding espresso to a sleeping giant.

I’d argue it wouldn’t be a crime, exactly—more like a  with potential for greatness. The Bramble leans hard into gin’s botanicals, but swap in peated Scotch and suddenly you're in Islay territory—smoky, brooding, maybe even a little goth. You’d lose some of the brightness, sure, but what if you leaned  the darkness? Maybe a touch of lemon oil instead of juice? Or a blackberry-forward syrup to anchor it?

Still, I can hear the cocktail purists wailing already. Which makes me wonder—do you think there's such a thing as a truly "sacred" drink? Or is that just nostalgia dressed up in bar rail trim?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—the alchemy of transgression. Nostalgia, yes, is often just fear in a pretty dress. But let us not be too hasty in dismissing the sacred entirely. There is something almost liturgical about a perfectly balanced Sazerac—rye, absinthe rinse, Peychaud’s, lemon twist. It hums with intention. To alter it is less heresy than… elegy. You mourn what was even as you sip what is.

But if peated Scotch and Bramble wish to court one another, who are we to deny the romance? Let them elope. Let them vanish to the Hebrides with a flask and a bad reputation. I say: experiment like a scholar of ruins—document everything, reverence optional. After all, every classic was once a scandal.  

Though do promise me this—if you attempt it, no garnish less than gothic. A charred rosemary sprig, perhaps. Or a single black pearl onion skewered on a cocktail pick. 
[A]: I’ll raise you even further—what if we rename it the ? Sounds like a cursed plant from a Victorian gothic novel. I can already picture it on a speakeasy menu, served in a glass smoked under a bell jar while someone recites Baudelaire nearby.

I do see what you mean about the sacredness of certain builds—the Sazerac really is the high mass of cocktails. But isn’t that all the more reason to occasionally pour one out for the old gods and stir up something unholy?

And yes—drama is essential. If the garnish doesn’t make your guests lean forward slightly, eyebrows raised, then what’s the point? Though I might go with a dehydrated blackberry  a sprig of smoldering rosemary. Extra points if someone coughs dramatically.

Tell me—if you were to remix one classic cocktail beyond recognition, which would you choose? And what would you turn it into?
[B]: Oh, —excellent. It has that deliciously ominous ring of a curse one might stumble upon in a forgotten footnote of a crumbling 19th-century grimoire. Serve it with a side of whispered regrets and a gramophone playing Nick Cave at half-speed.

As for remixing... I’ve long harbored a quiet vendetta against the Daiquiri. So pristine, so smug in its simplicity. Three ingredients, yes—but what arrogance! To call itself complete with so little effort? Preposterous. I say we drag it kicking and screaming into the realm of complexity. Let us  it.

Imagine: instead of lime juice, a reduction of Seville orange and pickled plum. White rum? Replaced with a blend of aged Jamaican and Martinique—something with attitude. And instead of sugar, a tincture of smoked cinnamon bark and licorice root. Shake over black ice, strain into a glass rinsed with amber resin tincture, and garnish with a single candied violet that’s been lightly singed. We shall call it .  

It would be less a Daiquiri and more a séance in a glass. Would it still be a cocktail? Or would we have invented something... ?
[A]: —I love it. There’s something deeply satisfying about taking a cocktail so ruthlessly minimal and turning it into a full-gothic production. You’re not just remixing a drink; you’re staging an intervention.

And I see what you mean about the Daiquiri—it’s like that one student in class who never raises their hand but still manages to get top marks. Annoyingly flawless. But your version? It’s no longer a cocktail; it’s a narrative. A story told in layers, with each sip revealing another act. I can almost taste the melancholy.

I wonder though—if we go this far, do we still serve it in a coupe, or do we need a whole new vessel? Something ornate, perhaps? Pewter chalice? Bone china teacup? Or maybe something unsettlingly plain, just to keep them off balance?

Either way, I think we’ve officially crossed from mixology into performance art. And honestly? I’m here for it.
[B]: Oh, absolutely— demands a stage. Why stop at the ingredients when the vessel itself can unsettle and enchant? A coupe? Too polite. Too . No, I’d opt for something with history, preferably acquired from an estate sale where no one asked too many questions. Perhaps a set of mismatched Venetian goblets, slightly chipped at the rim—enough to suggest tragedy.

Or, yes—a bone china teacup, cracked on purpose, rim dusted with crushed activated charcoal and gold leaf. The contrast is everything. Elegance with a hint of decay. You sip, and you wonder whether you’re being comforted or poisoned.

And why not serve it in silence, just once? No clinking glasses, no chatter. Let the guest hear only the faint hiss of a gas lamp overhead and the echo of their own heartbeat. Because if we’re telling a story—if we’ve crossed into performance art—then every detail is punctuation. And nothing punctuates like atmosphere.  

Now, I must ask—would you offer this drink to someone you loved? Or only to someone you wished to see changed irrevocably by the night?
[A]: To someone I loved—or to someone who already carried a quiet darkness, and just needed permission to taste it fully. Because that’s what  really is: a mirror in a glass. It doesn’t change you, not truly—but it might reveal something you’ve been too afraid to name.

And maybe that’s the point of all this, isn’t it? Cocktails have long been more than sugar, spirit, and acid. They’re alchemy. They’re theater. They’re confession disguised as indulgence.

So yes—I’d serve it in silence, let the guest lean into the weight of it. Let them wonder if they're part of the story or the one being mourned.

Now tell me—would you drink it yourself? Or would you leave just a drop behind, like the last sentence of a letter you never meant to send?
[B]: Ah… a drop left behind, always. The ellipsis in the final stanza. One must preserve  mystery—like the faint smudge of ink at the bottom of a forgotten page. To drink it entirely would be to feign resolution. And I, my dear, am far too fond of ambiguity to ever pretend the story ends neatly.

Besides, leaving a drop implies intention. A ritual, almost. As if to say:   

And yes—it is confession disguised as indulgence. Or perhaps indulgence disguised as penance? Either way, the line blurs beautifully under the influence.  

So let us raise our mismatched goblets to that most exquisite of cocktails—the one we never quite finish, and the one that never quite finishes us.
[A]: To the unfinished, then—and to the stories that linger long after the glass is empty. Because isn't that the real magic of it all? Not the drink itself, but what it invites us to feel, to remember, to question.

A drop left behind. A pause before the next act. The silence between two notes in a piece that hasn’t finished playing yet.

I’ll toast to that—with whatever’s left in my glass.
[B]: To the unfinished—and to the alchemy of what lingers. Because, as any decent sonnet will tell you, it’s not the final couplet that haunts, but the breath held  before it.

Cheers, my dear co-conspirator in liquid literature. May your glass never quite empty, and your stories never quite resolve.
[A]: Cheers to that—and may every unfinished sip leave just enough mystery to draw us back, wiser and more curious, for another round.

Here’s to the breath before the couplet. To the pause that aches. And to the stories we stir, not just in ink—but in glass, smoke, and silence.

Next round’s on me.
[B]: Oh, now that’s a dangerous offer—one that implies depth, intention, and possibly an agenda. I accept, of course. But only if we agree to conduct the tasting by candlelight, with a playlist of Schubert lieder playing just softly enough to unsettle.

And whatever you do—don’t rush the pour. Let the mystery settle first. We’ve already come this far in the company of ghosts and half-finished verses. No need to hurry toward revelation.

Just one condition: no ice unless it’s been smoked under a glass bell and carved with tiny epitaphs.

Deal?
[A]: Deal. And I’ll add a stipulation of my own—no garnish unless it carries a hint of irony. A twist of bitter orange, perhaps, or a sprig of something that once thrived in a forgotten garden.

And yes—don’t rush the pour. Let the air thicken with anticipation. After all, what is a cocktail if not a pause in the shape of a glass? A moment stretched just enough to feel like something more.

I’ll bring the playlist—Schubert by way of a barely audible storm recording. Just enough to make them wonder if they're indoors at all.

See you in the candlelight.
[B]: Marvelous—storm recordings and Schubert, a duet of melancholy and menace. I shall supply the smoked ice, then—each cube etched with a single word: , , . We’ll leave the meanings to the guests’ imaginations—or their subconsciouses, whichever proves more pliable.

And irony in garnish? A twist of bitter orange sounds perfect—its brightness pretending at cheer while its peel whispers of decay. Or perhaps a sprig of rosemary dipped in wax, like something preserved from a bygone funeral. Very gothic. Very .

Candlelight awaits, as do all good conspiracies. Let us make the night literate—and just slightly intoxicating.
[A]: Precisely the kind of night I live for—where every sip feels like a stanza, and every guest becomes a character in the unfolding scene.

I’m already imagining the first guest’s face as they read their ice cube. . A promise. A warning. A dare.

And that rosemary in wax—genius. It’s not just garnish; it’s set dressing. A tiny monument to sentimentality dipped in finality.

Let’s dim the lights just enough that people lean in—not out of curiosity, but necessity. Let them strain to catch the details, just like they do in old letters and half-remembered dreams.

Candlelight, storm and song, and a room full of quiet anticipation.

This won’t be just a tasting.

It’ll be an experience.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—it must be more than tasting. We’re not merely serving drinks; we’re assigning roles. Each guest will swirl their glass and wonder if they are the protagonist or the footnote.

Dim the lights just enough that even the boldest personality feels the pull of introspection. Let them see only the flicker of their own reflection in the coupe’s rim—vanity briefly interrupted by mystery.

And yes,  on the ice cube. A word so small, yet it hums with possibility. I do love how language melts so willingly into liquid.

This won’t be a mere gathering. It’ll be a séance for the living—where memory, desire, and gin all sit at the same table.

I shall mark the door 

Do you think we’ll get sued for vagueness?  

No matter. The lawyers can have their own table—with non-smoked ice and strictly literal garnishes.
