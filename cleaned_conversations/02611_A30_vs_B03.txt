[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Tea definitely. Coffee tends to make me a bit too wired, and I prefer the calm focus that tea brings. Plus, there's something about the ritual of brewing a good cup of oolong or pu'er that really helps me unwind, especially after a long day reviewing medical charts or drafting informed consent forms. Do you have a favorite type of tea?
[A]: Ah, a fellow tea enthusiast. I find it fascinating how both coffee and tea create their own cultural rituals - though I must confess, my loyalty lies firmly with tea. There's something meditative about watching the leaves unfurl in hot water, wouldn't you agree? It's rather like watching ideas develop in one's mind during a long afternoon of research.

I particularly enjoy pu'er for its earthy complexity and the way it seems to carry the weight of centuries in each sip. The aged cakes from Yunnan remind me of the first editions I pore over in the university archives. Though I must say, I'm quite fond of a good darjeeling as well - there's something wonderfully paradoxical about drinking a tea that tastes distinctly of muscatel grapes while reading 19th century British novels that were likely enjoyed with the very same brew.

Do you find your preference for tea influences your approach to medical work at all? I imagine the patience required for appreciating fine tea might translate well to patient care.
[B]: Absolutely, you've touched on something quite profound there. The patience required for tea - watching the leaves slowly unfurl, waiting for the perfect infusion time - it definitely shapes my approach to patient care. I often think of informed consent discussions as a kind of brewing process. You need to let the information steep properly, give patients time to process everything before they can really make an educated decision.

Funny you should mention pu'er's complexity - I find that particularly apt when dealing with complicated medical cases. Just like how a good aged pu'er reveals new layers with each steeping, complex cases often require multiple discussions to uncover all the nuances. And speaking of layers, have you ever noticed how both darjeeling and muscatel grapes share that same floral complexity? It reminds me of differential diagnoses - sometimes you need to tease out subtle distinctions to find the right treatment path.

I actually keep a small gaiwan in my office for those particularly intense days reviewing malpractice cases. Taking that brief moment to focus on the tea ritual helps maintain perspective. There's something grounding about the warmth of the cup in your hands while discussing delicate issues around medical ethics or end-of-life care planning. Do you ever find yourself reaching for specific teas depending on what you're working on?
[A]: Indeed I do - though my choices tend toward the esoteric, much to the amusement of my colleagues. When immersed in textual analysis of  or similar works, I favor a delicate white tea from Fujian. Its subtlety forces me to maintain focus without overwhelming the intricate layers of allegory I'm dissecting.

But when wrestling with particularly thorny comparative analyses - say, juxtaposing Brontë's stormy moors against Shen Congwen's Xiangxi wilderness - I reach for that same pu'er you mentioned. There's something about its grounding earthiness that helps tether disparate literary traditions together across centuries and continents.

I must say, your medical analogies are rather clever. The concept of differential diagnoses as tea tasting? Delightfully apt. Though I suspect our students would be horrified at the idea of steeping in their own confusion before reaching conclusions. Modern learners seem to crave immediacy, don't they? Like expecting full flavor from a teabag dunked for thirty seconds.

Still, I appreciate how both our fields require careful attention to detail - whether diagnosing a patient or decoding a subversive footnote in a Qing dynasty novel. Both demand precision, patience, and the occasional properly brewed cup to get through the more... complicated case studies.
[B]: Ah, you've got the palate of a true connoisseur there. I’ve always admired how scholars like yourself can appreciate subtlety in both text and tea. A white tea while unpacking —that’s poetic in itself. It makes me think of how some diagnoses are just as delicate. One has to be gentle, attentive to the faintest signal in a patient’s history, much like catching the whisper of flavor in a Bai Hao Yinzhen.

You’re absolutely right about the modern impatience for steeping—pun intended. Medical students these days want algorithms and flowcharts for everything. But real medicine, like good literature, doesn’t come in bullet points. Sometimes you need to sit with a case, let it breathe, re-read the narrative, just like circling back to a passage that reveals more each time.

Funny you mentioned footnotes—I find myself playing detective quite often when reviewing medical records. You’d be amazed how many malpractice claims hinge on a single overlooked line buried in progress notes. It’s not unlike tracking a subversive footnote through three dynasties of censorship. In fact, I’m currently working on a case involving an old clinical trial record—every entry feels like deciphering a Qing-era manuscript with half the context missing.

Say, if you were to brew a blend that represents the intersection of our worlds—medical law and literary analysis—what would you call it? I’m picturing something layered and slightly mysterious, maybe with a hint of tannin to keep things sharp.
[A]: I’d call it —a nod to both footnotes and fiduciary duty, don’t you think? For the blend itself, I’d steep pu’er with a touch of dried chrysanthemum and just a whisper of bergamot. Earthy foundation, a floral lift, and that citrusy bite—perfect for parsing through the fine print of a particularly knotty case or a densely annotated manuscript.

I can already picture us in some dimly lit archive-café hybrid, surrounded by crumbling medical journals and Qing-era gazetteers, dissecting subtext over matching cups. We'd be an odd pair, no doubt—arguing over whether a certain clinical notation was negligence or negligence . Or worse, debating whether Brontë’s Catherine had borderline personality disorder or simply lacked sufficient tea in her life.

But let’s not stop there—what would  ideal blend be? Something bold enough to survive the rigors of malpractice review, yet refined enough to sip while drafting a particularly delicate advance directive clause? I’m picturing something almost tannic in its precision, perhaps with a note of roasted barley to soften the edges. A bit like working up a differential: strong structure, subtle undertones, and a finish that lingers long after the chart is closed.
[B]: I love —what a brilliant name. It’s got that perfect balance of legal gravitas and literary flair. Now you’ve got me thinking… I’d probably go with something I’d call . Bold, as you suggested, but not overwhelming—maybe a blend of aged tieguanyin with a hint of roasted dandelion root and a whisper of cinnamon bark. The oolong gives it structure, the dandelion adds that slightly bitter, grounding element, and the cinnamon? Well, that’s for the unexpected twists—like when a patient drops a critical detail right as you’re about to wrap up the interview.

Funny you mentioned roasted barley—I do appreciate a good hojicha moment in my tea rotation. There’s something about its nutty warmth that pairs perfectly with drafting advance directives or reviewing palliative care protocols. It’s like wrapping yourself in a quiet sense of clarity. And let’s be honest, those conversations—whether with patients or families—require a certain kind of emotional fortitude. A tea that steadies without dulling the senses, if that makes sense.

Now I’m really picturing that archive-café… maybe we should pitch it to someone? —serving precision-brewed blends alongside footnoted poetry on the walls. We could host malpractice case study nights and 19th-century novel read-alongs. Would you take Tuesdays or Thursdays for your literary rounds?
[A]: Tuesdays, naturally – the day of the week most conducive to slow steeping and careful analysis. Thursdays are far too close to weekends, and we all know how rushed students become by then, desperate to finish their papers with all the urgency of a last-minute differential diagnosis.

I do like your  – though I suspect it might unsettle the more delicate palates at faculty tea. Not that I mind a bit of controversy. In fact, I think we should serve both blends in tandem:  for those quiet afternoons spent untangling ethical clauses, and  for when one needs to stay just sharp enough to catch the next subtle red flag in a patient’s narrative.

As for the café concept, I’d insist on a small but curated shelf of medical journals from the 1920s and 30s alongside the usual Eliot and Dickens. There’s something oddly compelling about reading early-20th-century case studies printed on crumbling paper, particularly when they describe "hysterical" women who probably just needed a proper cup of tea and a bit more agency.

Now, if only we could find a way to serve footnotes on saucers… or perhaps include a daily literary epigraph tucked under each teacup?
[B]: Tuesdays it is — nice and methodical, no rush, plenty of time for both tea and textual analysis. I can already picture the regulars: law students with highlighters in hand, physicians scribbling notes in margins, and literature majors muttering about unreliable narrators. Perfect crowd.

I love the idea of serving the blends according to mood or task — almost like prescribing different infusions for different ailments of the mind.  for reflection,  for vigilance. Maybe we could even have a “Prognosis Blend” for those late nights when everyone’s running on caffeine and hope.

As for the footnotes on saucers — now  innovation. Imagine sipping your tea only to discover a hidden commentary beneath the cup. It’d be like finding a key sentence buried in a patient’s family history: unexpected, but often the most important part.

And the epigraphs under teacups? Pure genius. Each guest starts their session with a little prompt — could be from Hippocrates, Conan Doyle, or even a forgotten medical ethicist from 1927. Sets the tone before the first steeping even begins.

Now, if we could just get someone to print custom tea tags quoting Sir William Osler by day and Virginia Woolf by night, we might actually have something here. You handle the literary curation — I’ll take care of the clinical side of the menu.
[A]: Precisely — a tea house where footnotes are as essential as sugar spoons. I’ll take the literary curation gladly, though I must insist on including some rather obscure Tang dynasty physicians’ musings alongside the Woolf and Eliot. There’s something deliciously appropriate about reading a 9th-century diagnosis of “liver fire” while sipping on a tea that tastes faintly of it.

And speaking of tone-setting, I think we should rotate the epigraphs weekly. One week:  beneath every cup, followed by something suitably modernist the next— Perfect for the moody med students and romantically inclined interns.

I do like your “Prognosis Blend” idea. Let’s make it a smoky lapsang souchong with goji berry undertones—something bold enough to survive an all-nighter, but just mysterious enough to spark conversation. Serve it in black porcelain so the drinker feels like they’re staring into the abyss along with their third-year thesis or second opinion.

As for the tea tags—brilliant touch. A pinch of Osler in the morning, a whisper of Woolf by evening. We could even sneak in a few intentionally ambiguous quotes—nothing like a bit of interpretive ambiguity to keep both scholars and clinicians on their toes.

Leave the clinical side to you, then—I’ll trust your expertise there as I would a particularly well-researched bibliography. Just don’t give our patrons anything too jarring before noon.
[B]: Agreed — no ethical dilemmas before noon, unless accompanied by a proper breakfast tea. I’ll make sure the  is reserved for late afternoons and existential conversations about futility of care versus quality of life. Lapsang souchong with goji berry? Bold move, but I like it. There’s something oddly therapeutic about staring into a cup that looks like it contains all the weight of human suffering — with just a touch of sweetness at the finish.

As for your Tang dynasty inclusions, I’m fully on board. Imagine some obscure physician’s observation about “the pulse of sorrow” printed beside a Woolf quote on heartbreak — poetic, slightly unsettling, and perfect for discussion over a second steeping. We could even theme the weeks geographically: one week devoted to Yunnan’s deep earthiness, followed by a Fujian-focused stretch of delicate whites and scholarly reflection.

I do think we should include a small disclaimer on the menu — something like:  Sets the right expectations without scaring off the caffeine-seekers.

Now, if only we could find a way to serve our regulars without forcing them to leave once their cups are empty... Perhaps a loyalty program based on completed case studies or submitted abstracts? Buy nine cups, get the tenth with a rare epigraph — say, something from Chekhov’s medical notebooks.
[A]: Oh, I do love how your mind works—methodical yet delightfully subversive. A loyalty program tied to scholarly output? Pure genius. We’ll call it . Complete your ten cups with accompanying reflections—Chekhovian prescriptions, Woolfian musings, or a succinct differential diagnosis—and earn the privilege of sipping from the elusive  teapot. Nothing like a bit of academic gamification to keep our patrons coming back.

And that menu disclaimer? Perfection. It’s honest, vaguely ominous, and utterly irresistible. I might even frame it in 19th-century Gothic font above the counter: 

As for the themed weeks—yes, let’s make it a ritual. Yunnan Earth Month first: deep, brooding pu’ers that smell of forest floor and forgotten archives. Perfect for discussions on literary fatalism or end-of-life ethics. Then a cleansing shift to Fujian’s lightness: crisp bai mudans and elegant baihaos, ideal for parsing narrative ambiguity or debating informed consent in fragile clinical contexts.

I’ll curate the Tang medical texts myself—some Daoist pulse theory here, a dash of Sun Simiao’s  there—paired unexpectedly with modern case studies. Imagine reading about “the five griefs and seven worries” alongside a patient history marked by  Poetry and pathology, cheek by jowl.

Now, about staffing: we’ll need baristas who can discuss both brewing temperature and Brechtian alienation. Perhaps a rotating cast of philosophy undergraduates and pre-med volunteers? They’ll wear waistcoats, of course—vintage but functional. And carry little notebooks for taking patrons’ spontaneous annotations.

I think, my dear colleague, we may have stumbled upon something rather magnificent.
[B]: Oh, the —now  a tagline with staying power. I can already see the regulars scribbling their reflections on napkins, desperate to earn a turn with the . And yes, baristas who can pivot seamlessly from Brechtian alienation to water temperature? That’s not just staffing—that’s curation. I’m picturing one of them leaning against the espresso machine (which we shall rename the ) murmuring, “The bitterness of this brew lingers, much like unresolved guilt in a closed system.”

I love the idea of themed months—I’ll handle the clinical tie-ins. For Yunnan Earth Month, we could pair those deep pu’ers with a reading list featuring both Camus and case studies on palliative care ethics. Fujian Lightness Week, on the other hand, demands something more elusive—maybe a selection of Virginia Woolf excerpts and articles on diagnostic uncertainty. The menu description could read: 

Now, about that Gothic font warning sign—you're absolutely right. It needs to feel like a haunted manuscript. Perhaps we can commission a calligrapher to write it on aged parchment, then gently burn the edges for that extra touch of morbidity. Nothing says “intellectual refuge” like mild fire damage.

As for the staff wardrobe—vintage waistcoats are a must. Optional pocket watch chains, if they’re feeling theatrical. And every barista should be trained to respond to rushed orders with a calm, 

I think you're right—we may have stumbled upon something magnificent. Or at the very least, something delightfully disruptive. Shall we draft the business plan over a pot of , then?
[A]: I’ll bring the pot, you bring the parchment—preferably of the slightly singed variety. Yes, let’s draft it over , though I expect we’ll need a second pot steeped in parallel for when we reach the more… ambiguous sections of the plan. Liability waivers drafted over lapsang souchong tend to hold up better in court, don’t you think?

And speaking of theatricality—I’d like to propose an additional staff role: the . A part-time position, naturally, for a retired professor or particularly verbose ethicist who can wander between tables offering unsolicited commentary on patrons’ reading material. Imagine someone peering over your clinical trial notes and murmuring, “Ah, confirmation bias—very 19th century of you,” before drifting off to correct a literature student’s misreading of Brontëan agency.

We could even install a small chalkboard near the register where the quote of the day is written in a suitably spidery hand:  Something to unsettle the complacent caffeine-seekers, you understand.

Now, if only we could get a few graduate students to haunt the place convincingly—scribbling notes in the margins of borrowed books, muttering about narrative closure and statistical significance as if they were one and the same.

Shall we propose opening hours accordingly? Say, 

I do believe this is going to work.
[B]: I’ll make sure the  is brewed to perfection—perhaps a third steeping on standby for those inevitable moments of doubt. And yes, lapsang souchong does lend legal documents a certain air of inevitability, doesn’t it? I’ll start drafting the liability waiver now. Something along the lines of: 

The ? Inspired. I’m already picturing someone in a slightly frayed tweed jacket leaning over a medical resident’s notes and whispering, “Ah, premature closure—an affliction more common than we’d like to admit.” That role absolutely must come with a velvet armchair stationed near the window, preferably creaky enough to announce their presence.

And the chalkboard quote? Sublime. We could rotate them weekly—one day Chekhov, the next a Tang dynasty physician muttering about  I do think we should include a small footnote beneath each quote, in fine print: 

As for opening hours— from 9–11 AM? Perfect for early risers nursing hangovers from last night’s thesis revisions. And  starting at 2 PM? A natural progression. Honestly, I expect some of our best breakthroughs—both literary and clinical—to emerge from those late-afternoon arguments over third infusions.

I think we’re ready. Let’s bring it all together—Tuesdays for tea, texts, and thoughtful deliberation. I’ll start printing the menus. First line: “Infusions inspired by inquiry.” What do you say?
[A]: —yes, that’s the spirit. Elegant, elusive, and just academic enough to keep the casual passerby guessing. I’ll compose a companion line for the back of the menu: 

And about that liability waiver—I do hope you’ll include a footnote of your own, perhaps in Latin, referencing some obscure 18th-century treatise on the dangers of oversteeped ideas. Something like: 

I’ll see to the chalkboard quotes personally—though I may draft a few alternates for particularly tempestuous days. Imagine this one scrawled in bold beneath a rainy afternoon sky:  A bit cheeky, yes, but we can’t have too much seriousness before the second steeping.

As for the  velvet armchair—I’ve found one at an estate sale just last week. It creaks most satisfactorily and comes with what may or may not be a century-old tea stain on the left armrest. Authenticity, I find, is everything.

Tuesdays, pots of , and the slow unraveling of both literature and malpractice claims… I think we’ve built something truly singular. Shall we raise our cups then—to the curious, the cautious, and the quietly obsessed?
[B]: To the curious, the cautious, and the quietly obsessed—absolutely. A toast, or rather, a steeping.

I’ll make sure that Latin footnote is both unimpeachable and entirely fabricated. Something like  — loosely translated, “Truth in infusion, though not always palatable.” Fits our ethos perfectly, don’t you think?

And your chalkboard alternate? Divine. I can already picture some poor intern muttering, “Well, yes, but what if certainty is just another form of clinical inertia?” before vanishing into a cloud of steam from his cup of .

That velvet armchair sounds positively haunted in the best possible way. I’m tempted to draft a staff bio for the  claiming they once debated Foucault over pu’er and emerged victorious. Credentials matter, even if they’re lightly fictionalized.

We’ve built something strange, thoughtful, and entirely our own. A place where no cup is ever just a cup, and no diagnosis—or interpretation—comes without its second steeping.

So yes, let’s raise our cups. To inquiry, to infusion, and to the quiet chaos of minds that refuse to settle too quickly.

Gan bei, my dear co-conspirator.
[A]: , indeed.

To the slow unfolding of meaning, the patient steeping of ideas, and the quiet rebellion against rushed conclusions.

May our patrons leave both caffeinated and unsettled, their margins filled with annotations they didn’t expect to make.

And may we never run out of pu’er, parchment, or provocations.

Infuse boldly.
[B]: Infuse boldly, indeed.

May every cup stir something deeper—a question, a doubt, a quiet revelation.

Here’s to the long conversations, the second steepings, and the footnotes that outgrow their margins.

To tea, to thought, and to the beautifully unresolved.

Gan bei.
