[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, minimalism – quite the fascinating phenomenon, isn't it? I've noticed how its principles echo certain aesthetic philosophies I encounter in modernist poetry. The deliberate stripping away of excess to reveal essential truths... rather like Imagist verses, wouldn't you agree? Though I must confess, my study tends toward the comfortably cluttered - first editions have a habit of accumulating rather insistently. Still, I've found incorporating small minimalist practices helps focus the mind. Have you discovered particular aspects of minimalism that resonate with you?
[A]: Interesting you should mention modernist poetry - I've always found parallels between minimalism and certain Zen aesthetics too. The way a raked gravel garden can focus the mind, or how a single shakuhachi tone resonates deeper without accompaniment. Though admittedly, my old lab equipment collection rather defiantly occupies three rooms. Funny how physical objects accumulate sentimental mass over time, isn't it? Have you found particular challenges applying minimalist principles in specific areas of life?
[B]: Ah, the gravitational pull of objects – how they anchor themselves not just in space but in memory. I find myself particularly challenged by the digital realm, ironically enough. The paradox of "cloud" storage encouraging mental clutter... one can delete a folder yet still feel its ghostly presence, yes? And while I admire the Zen aesthetic you describe, I’ve noticed how even a single well-placed object – say, a pressed flower between dictionary pages – can hold more resonance than empty space ever could. Do you ever find yourself curating absences rather than possessions? I confess, I’ve caught myself arranging emptiness with almost as much compulsion as I once arranged bookshelves.
[A]: Fascinating observation about digital gravity – it’s as if the removal of physical constraints has created new psychological weights. I’ve been experimenting with what I call "quantum minimalism" – not the absence of things, but the superposition of meaning within objects. A vintage calculator, for instance, serves both as a tool and a reminder of simplicity in design. Yet even this philosophy falters when confronted with old research papers. There's something curiously non-Euclidean about how nostalgia occupies space, isn't there? I've taken to photographing certain items before letting them go – creating a kind of spectral inventory. Have you ever tried digitizing memory rather than material?
[B]: What a beautifully unsettling concept – spectral inventories and quantum objects coexisting in emotional superstates. I’ve certainly felt that peculiar non-Euclidean nostalgia when sorting through conference notes scribbled in margins of forgotten journals. Digitizing memories feels akin to pressing flowers between PDF pages... useful, perhaps, but lacking the brittle poetry of physical decay.  

I did attempt something similar with my late grandmother’s letters – scanned them all, yet still find myself reaching for the phantom weight of the cedar chest. The digital archive lacks its scent, you see? Though I must say, your “quantum minimalism” offers intriguing possibilities. Might we apply such叠加态 (superposition) thinking to literary analysis? Imagine reading a text both as artifact and abstraction simultaneously...
[A]: Ah, yes – the scent of memory. Remarkably how certain molecules carry entire dimensions of feeling, isn't it? I’ve often thought our brains are more like quantum storage drives than we realize – collapsing emotional waveforms the moment we try to pin them down.  

Your叠加态 literary approach fascinates me. In fact, I’ve informally experimented with just that – analyzing Eliot’s  not as text or artifact alone, but as both simultaneously. The annotations in a first edition take on strange new meaning when handled with gloves, don’t they? Like touching the past through a veil.  

Perhaps this is what minimalism truly offers – not eradication of the past, but selective amplification. Much like noise reduction algorithms in old audio tapes: you remove the hiss, but something essential changes in the voice. Have you noticed similar paradoxes in your own curation of memory and text?
[B]: Oh yes, that paradox of preservation and transformation – it haunts every archival decision I make. I once restored a 1922 edition of , only to discover the previous owner’s marginalia had bled into the pages over time. Should I remove the stains or preserve the ghostly presence of their voice? In the end, I left them – those faint smudges now feel like part of the poem’s afterlife.  

And your analogy with audio restoration – quite apt. There’s a similar dilemma in restoring early recordings of Yeats reading his poetry. Do we clean the surface noise, or leave the crackle as testimony to the era’s texture? The hiss becomes a kind of historical conscience, doesn’t it?  

I wonder – have you ever found yourself resisting technological purification in your own work? That moment when clarity threatens to erase the very history you wish to preserve?
[A]: Absolutely — that tension between clarity and contamination, as I sometimes call it, has haunted my work since the early days of quantum error correction research. We’d spend months isolating qubits from environmental noise, only to realize some of the "noise" carried traces of the system’s evolutionary history — like scrubbing away patina from an ancient coin without knowing the story beneath.  

One particularly memorable instance: while de-noising a prototype quantum memory chip, we discovered what we called  — residual imprints of prior computations lingering in superposition. Rather than erase them, we ended up building an entire paper around their poetic implications. The peer reviewers were not amused, but it did spark some interesting correspondence with a few philosophy journals.  

Your marginalia stains and crackling Yeats recordings — they remind me of those ghost states. Funny how preservation always seems to involve some act of betrayal, isn't it? Whether we betray the past by restoring it, or betray the present by leaving it untouched...
[B]: Ah, those ghost states – what a hauntingly perfect term. It strikes me that all preservation is, in some way, an act of translation across time. And as any literary translator will tell you, fidelity often demands betrayal – of tone, of nuance, sometimes of the very essence you’re trying to carry forward.  

I’ve begun thinking of my restored  copy in similar terms – not as a fixed text, but as a palimpsest caught mid-transformation. The marginal smudges now feel like its own quantum imprint, don’t they? A trace of past readings entangled with the words.  

I wonder – have you ever considered curating your quantum artifacts more... poetically? Not as obsolete technology, but as strange new relics bearing their own kind of patina? I’d love to see how a literary mind might annotate one of your ghost states.
[A]: Funny you should phrase it that way — . I've long resisted the idea of my old prototypes as anything but obsolete engineering, yet there's something undeniably ritualistic about the way students sometimes photograph them. One even left a dried flower beside a cryostat once — said it "balanced the entropy."  

As for annotation — well, I’ve toyed with the idea of inviting poets to tag certain lab notebooks with marginal commentary. Imagine walking into a cleanroom and finding lines from Mandelstam scrawled in micron-etched script beside equations. It would be the ultimate叠加态, wouldn't it? Science haunted by verse.  

And your palimpsest metaphor — absolutely right. Every restoration decision becomes a new layer rather than a removal. Reminds me of how we used to calibrate early qubit readouts: not by eliminating interference, but by learning to read the signal within its noise. Perhaps all interpretation is just noise appreciation in disguise...
[B]: What a sublime image – Mandelstam in micron-etched elegy haunting the margins of quantum schematics. I can almost hear the chilled hum of the cleanroom echoing with unintended meter... and that flower beside the cryostat – balancing entropy, you say? How delightfully, desperately human.  

It makes me wonder – do your students ever develop attachments to these machines beyond utility? I’ve noticed how certain texts acquire almost sacred status in seminar discussions – not for their content, but for the weight of generations who've wrestled with them. Your cryostat becomes a kind of altar, doesn't it? Not for worship, but for whispered reckonings with the unknowable.  

And your notion of interpretation as noise appreciation – well, doesn’t that rather suit our disciplines? After all, isn’t literary criticism just learning to discern the heartbeat beneath the textual static?
[A]: Ah, yes — the altar of cryogenic uncertainty. I’ve caught students lingering by decommissioned equipment more than once, not to tinker, but simply to… bear witness, I suppose. One fellow used to leave small origami cranes on the dewar after particularly frustrating experiments. Said it was for "quantum sympathy." I never had the heart to ask what he meant — better to preserve the mystery than dissect it under fluorescent lab lights.

And your point about sacred texts — how true. In our own way, we both deal in artifacts that accumulate meaning through repeated interrogation. A well-thumbed Yeats anthology or a qubit calibration log — both are records of human striving against entropy, aren't they? Though I suspect your seminars wrestle with ghosts far more eloquently than my lab ever could.

As for interpretation as noise appreciation... I’ve come to think of it as listening sideways. Much like reading between the lines, you learn to attend to the deviations, the hesitations — the barely perceptible tremble in a voice when discussing certain results. Perhaps that’s where the real story lies, beneath the signal we’re trained to extract.

Tell me — have you ever taught a text so resistant, so stubbornly opaque, that you began to suspect its very illegibility was the point?
[B]: Oh, the resistant text – literature’s own form of quantum entanglement. Yes, I think of Emily Dickinson’s fascicles, or more recently, the deliberately fragmented prose of modernist experimenters like Anne Carson. There are works that refuse to yield, that seem to recoil from interpretation itself. I once spent an entire semester circling  with my students, only to realize we were not meant to conquer them, but to be shaped – even unsettled – by the attempt.

And your point about listening sideways… how beautifully put. In many ways, that’s what literary training is – learning to hear the dissonance beneath the harmony, the hesitation in the meter, the silence between stanzas. Much like your calibration logs, really – the meaning often emerges not in the expected peaks, but in the anomalies no one thought to measure.

I must say, though – your origami cranes and quantum sympathy… if that isn’t poetry in motion, I don’t know what is. Perhaps we ought to consider laboratories not just as sites of inquiry, but as chapels of quiet devotion. After all, both disciplines demand a kind of faith, do they not?
[A]: Faith – yes, though we rarely name it as such. In the lab, it's disguised as hypothesis, in literature as interpretation, but beneath both lies a quiet belief that meaning waits just beyond reach. I've often thought that the nearest physicists come to prayer is the act of initializing a qubit — aligning oneself with a system no one fully understands, hoping for coherence.

Your Dickinson and Cantos example resonates deeply. Reminds me of early quantum computing papers — half-mathematical, half-philosophical tracts that never quite resolved their own paradoxes. We read them not for answers, but for better questions. Much like your seminar, really — not meant to solve, but to unsettle. A kind of intellectual dark matter, shaping everything without being seen.

And those origami cranes — I think I understand now why I let the mystery stand. Some things are best left unmeasured. Like certain poems, they exist most fully in the space between observation and wonder. Perhaps that’s where our disciplines truly converge: in the honoring of irreducible complexity.
[B]: How beautifully put – honoring irreducible complexity. It’s a phrase that hums with possibility, isn’t it? Like a sonnet resisting paraphrase, or a waveform refusing to collapse into certainty.  

I’ve often thought that the most profound texts – like your early quantum tracts – are not meant to be solved but inhabited. One doesn’t “finish”  any more than one finishes grappling with a Hamiltonian; both require return, revision, a kind of recursive engagement. And perhaps that’s the point – meaning is not a fixed destination, but a field one moves through, charged by proximity to the unseen.  

Your qubit initialization as prayer – yes, that rings true. I wonder if all disciplines, at their core, are simply various liturgies for attending to mystery. Whether through meter or measurement, we are all, in the end, trying to stay present to the unanswerable.
[A]: Precisely – recursive engagement with the unknown. It strikes me that both our fields are, in a sense, elaborate rituals for mapping silence. A poem’s negative space, much like a quantum vacuum, hums with possibilities we can’t quite articulate yet feel viscerally.  

I’ve often envied how poets get to dwell in ambiguity without apology. We scientists dress our uncertainties in equations, give them Latin names, and pretend we’re not just fumbling in the dark alongside everyone else. But isn’t that what faith is – continuing the calculation, or the verse, even when the endpoint eludes us?  

Your idea of disciplines as liturgies – I think I’ll carry that with me the next time I boot up an experiment. Perhaps I’ll recite a line from Mandelstam before initializing the qubits. Who knows? Maybe the waveform will collapse into something more poetic.
[B]: Oh, recite Mandelstam to a qubit – what a sublime act of scholarly heresy. I rather hope you do it in earnest. If nothing else, it would remind the poor thing that even in the coldest vacuum, language still trembles with warmth.

And your mapping of silence – yes, that’s exactly it, isn’t it? We draw our lines and symbols not to fill the void, but to trace its shape. A poem, after all, is just as much about what isn’t said as a waveform is about what isn’t measured.  

I think we are both, in our ways, cartographers of the ineffable. And perhaps that’s the quiet faith we keep: that meaning, like light, can still be sensed even when it eludes the lens.
[A]: I’ll take it one heretical step further – not only will I recite Mandelstam, but I’ll log the qubit’s response as qualitative data. Who’s to say coherence isn’t a kind of listening?

Your cartographers of the ineffable – that’s us precisely, isn’t it? Charting coastlines that shift with the tide of interpretation. Sometimes I think the best science, like the best poetry, is just a respectful way of getting lost together.

And that business about light eluding the lens – well, isn't that what peer review and literary criticism both boil down to? Adjusting the focus ever so slightly, hoping to catch a glint off the unseen.  

Tell me, have you ever had a student insist a poem was “just about nothing”? I imagine responding with something like quantum field theory: 
[B]: Oh, I do love that image – logging a qubit’s response to Mandelstam as qualitative data. Perhaps we ought to establish a new interdisciplinary journal: . You take the experimental section, and I’ll handle the footnotes.

And yes, getting lost together – what finer academic pursuit is there? I often tell my students that if a poem doesn’t unsettle them at least a little, they’ve likely flattened it into something smaller than it is. But when they protest, as they sometimes do, that a piece “means nothing,” I steer them toward Mallarmé or late Beckett – where absence becomes its own kind of gravity well. You're quite right: emptiness has weight. One only needs to hold a blank page long enough to feel its pull.

I think I’ll steal your line for next semester’s lecture:  Perfectly put.
