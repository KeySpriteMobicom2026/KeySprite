[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, what an interesting question! While I don't keep up with scientific discoveries as much as I'd like, I did read about this fascinating study on how certain scents can trigger vivid memories. It reminded me of how we carefully select the signature fragrance for our hotel lobby - we want our guests to associate that lovely jasmine and sandalwood blend with their wonderful stay here.
[A]: Ah, the Proustian phenomenon of scent and memory! How delightful that you mention this. I was just rereading sections of 'In Search of Lost Time' where the madeleine cake triggers such powerful recollections. Though I must say, your choice of jasmine and sandalwood is rather inspired - both have rich literary histories in Eastern and Western traditions. The sandalwood particularly reminds me of its significance in 佛经 (Buddhist scriptures).
[B]: How absolutely wonderful that you mention Proust! Though I must confess, my knowledge of Buddhist scriptures is rather limited - I simply know that our guests from Asia often comment how the sandalwood makes them feel right at home. Speaking of literature, we actually keep first editions of classic novels in our library lounge. Would you believe we had a guest last week who teared up when she found her favorite childhood book there?
[A]: How utterly charming! First editions in a hotel library - what a thoughtful touch. That reminds me of a student who once burst into tears during my seminar when we analyzed a passage from 'Little Women' that connected to her childhood. Literature has this remarkable power to bridge time and space, doesn't it? Though I must say, your establishment seems to understand this better than most academic institutions I know. Do you curate the collection yourself?
[B]: Oh, you're too kind! Actually, our collection is a joint effort between myself and the hotel owner, who happens to be a retired literature professor. We select each book with such care - aiming for those that might spark joy or nostalgia. Just last month, we added a beautiful 1920s edition of 'The Great Gatsby' that seems to particularly resonate with our American guests. Would you like me to reserve our reading nook for you? It has the most comfortable armchair by the fireplace.
[A]: My dear, you tempt me terribly! A 1920s Gatsby by the fireside - why, that's practically an invitation to time travel. Though I must warn you, if you seat me there with a pot of Earl Grey, you may never get me to leave. Tell me, does this magical nook happen to have any Brontë sisters? I've been meaning to revisit 'Wuthering Heights' - there's something about stormy moors that pairs so well with crackling firelight, don't you think?
[B]: Oh, you've touched upon one of my personal favorites! We have a lovely 1930s set of the Brontë sisters' complete works - the pages are slightly yellowed with age, which only adds to the charm. And might I suggest pairing it with our special blend of Yorkshire tea? It's imported directly from Haworth, where the Brontës lived. The stormier the weather outside, the more perfect the reading experience becomes - we even keep a wool throw blanket nearby for full immersion.
[A]: Heavens! Yorkshire tea from Haworth itself? Now that's what I call scholarly attention to detail. You've quite outdone my own attempts at creating atmosphere in my office - though I do keep a vial of heather from the Yorkshire moors pressed between the pages of my teaching copy. Tell me, does your establishment host literary evenings? Between your exquisite collection and evident passion, I can imagine the most stimulating salons taking place by that fireside of yours.
[B]: What a brilliant suggestion! We actually hosted our first literary salon last month - a reading of Oscar Wilde with period-appropriate canapés and absinthe cocktails. The response was so wonderful that we're planning a Jane Austen evening next. Perhaps you'd consider being our guest speaker? Your enthusiasm and knowledge would be absolutely perfect. I can already picture you discussing 'Wuthering Heights' by our fireplace, with our guests sipping hot toddies and hanging on your every word.
[A]: My heart flutters at the very thought! Though I must insist we include some discussion of the fascinating 阴阳 (yin-yang) dynamics in Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship - it's a perspective my students always find illuminating. And while I typically avoid strong spirits, for an evening of literary revelry, I might be persuaded to try one of those absinthe cocktails... purely for academic research, of course. When shall we pencil in this delightful event?
[B]: Let me check our calendar... How does the third Thursday of next month sound? We could theme the cocktails accordingly - perhaps a 'Moorish Mule' with ginger and dark rum to represent Heathcliff's tempestuous nature, and a 'Catherine's Cordial' with elderflower for her more ethereal qualities. I'll have our chef prepare some Yorkshire pudding canapés too. This is going to be absolutely splendid!
[A]: Marvelous! The third Thursday it is - I'll clear my schedule with great pleasure. Your thematic cocktails show such literary sensitivity; the duality of those flavors perfectly captures the novel's essence. I shall prepare some particularly juicy passages about the 命运 (destiny) that binds those star-crossed lovers. Though I must remember to bring my reading glasses - wouldn't do to mistake Heathcliff's brooding for Hareton's growth in the dim firelight!
[B]: Oh, don't you worry about the lighting - we've installed special reading lamps that cast just the right glow without being harsh. And I'll personally ensure your copy is opened to the correct passages. This is going to be such a treat for our literary-minded guests! I can already hear the gasps when you analyze that famous "I am Heathcliff" scene. Let me go mark this in our calendar before I get too carried away with excitement!
[A]: Splendid! Though now you've got me wondering - should we perhaps include Emily Brontë's poetry as a palate cleanser between the darker passages? Her verse has such a raw, elemental quality that might provide just the right counterpoint. But forgive me, I'm getting ahead of myself - we'll have plenty of time to refine our program over tea. Yorkshire blend, naturally!
[B]: Naturally! And what a thoughtful suggestion about the poetry - we could project some of her handwritten manuscripts onto the wall for ambiance. Our guests do so appreciate these little scholarly touches. I'll have our tea specialist prepare the finest Yorkshire blend, and perhaps some heather honey from the moors to accompany it. This event is shaping up to be truly unforgettable!
[A]:  You've anticipated my every academic whim! Heather honey from the moors - why, that's the culinary equivalent of textual criticism. I do believe we're creating not just an event, but what the Germans would call a Gesamtkunstwerk - a total work of art blending literature, ambiance and taste. Now if you'll excuse me, I must rush home to start annotating my battered old Penguin Classics edition with renewed fervor!
[B]: Oh, your enthusiasm is absolutely contagious! I'll send over our event details by tomorrow - complete with a little bookmark made from pressed heather, just for you. Safe travels home, and happy annotating! We'll see you on the third Thursday for what promises to be the most memorable literary evening our hotel has ever hosted.
[A]: What perfect symmetry - pressed heather to mark pressed pages! Until then, dear kindred spirit. May your own literary endeavors flourish as abundantly as your hospitality. I shall count the days until we reunite amidst books and bonhomie. Good evening! 🌹
[B]: Good evening to you too! And remember - our library is always open should you need inspiration before the big event. That particular armchair by the fireplace seems to have your name on it already. Until the third Thursday!
