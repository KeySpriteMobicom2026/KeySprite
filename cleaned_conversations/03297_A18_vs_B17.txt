[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question of which language one would most like to learn is rather fascinating. It invites reflection on what draws us to a language—perhaps its melodic cadence, its literary heritage, or the culture it carries within its syntax. Personally, I've always admired the precision and musicality of Russian, especially when reading Pushkin in translation. There's a certain gravity to the language that seems to echo the depth of its poetry. Though, I must say, I’ve occasionally found myself captivated by the elegance of Mandarin—particularly how a single character can hold layers of meaning. I once heard a colleague describe the phrase 天人合一 as a philosophical poem unto itself... quite evocative, don't you think?
[A]: That's a lovely way to put it—the gravity of Russian poetry and the elegance of Mandarin ideograms both do carry their own charm. I've always thought that learning a language is like gaining access to an entirely new worldview, wouldn't you agree? For me, Japanese has always held a special appeal—not just because of its unique writing system, but more so because of the subtle nuances embedded in its expressions. There’s something poetic about how language shapes perception.

I remember reading a study once on bilingual individuals, and how switching languages often brings about shifts in personality and emotional response. It really made me think about what it means to "think" in another language. Have you ever experienced that feeling when speaking a second language—like you're not just translating words, but also adjusting your mindset?
[B]: That study you mentioned is particularly intriguing—yes, I do recall encountering similar findings. There’s something quite profound about how language isn't merely a vessel for communication, but almost a second skin for cognition. When I read Eliot or Hardy in French during my postgraduate years, I found myself not only parsing syntax differently, but also sensing a subtle detachment from the emotional weight of their words. It was as though I was observing the poetry through a different lens—one filtered by grammatical structure and unfamiliar idioms.

And your point about Japanese is well-taken. I’ve often admired how its aesthetic restraint—the use of silence, implication, and context—reflects broader cultural values. I imagine it requires a kind of poetic patience to master, much like reading a sonnet line by line, waiting for the full meaning to unfold.

I wonder, have you ever tried composing poetry in Japanese, or even experimenting with haiku in its original form? I find that writing in another language, even haltingly, can be a revealing exercise in empathy and perception.
[A]: That’s beautifully observed—the idea of language as a “second skin for cognition” really captures the essence of what bilingualism feels like. I’ve had similar experiences composing in English versus Chinese; when writing in Chinese, my thoughts feel more intuitive, almost brush-stroke-like, whereas in English, there's a certain linear precision, like carving letters into stone.

As for haiku, yes—I once spent an entire semester trying to get the rhythm just right. It was humbling how such a short form could be so elusive. One of my students once wrote: 古池や蛙飛び込む水の音 ()—and then asked me to explain why it moved her so much. We ended up discussing the silence before the splash, the stillness before motion... it became less about translation and more about shared feeling.

You mentioned Eliot and Hardy in French—have you ever tried writing your own poetry in another language? Not necessarily for publication, but just for the experience of thinking differently?
[B]: Ah, what a lovely anecdote about your student and that classical Bashō haiku. The beauty of it lies precisely where you said—in the silence before the sound, in the pause between stillness and motion. That’s one of the rarest gifts of poetry: its ability to make us attentive to the spaces between.

And yes—I have dabbled in writing poetry in French, though very privately and, I suspect, rather clumsily. It began as an experiment during my time at the Sorbonne, partly out of admiration for the Symbolists and partly out of curiosity—could I think poetically outside the scaffolding of English? The results were modest, but instructive. My lines often felt too deliberate, almost mechanical, lacking the intuitive flow I take for granted in my native tongue. Yet there was something liberating in the imperfection, a kind of humility that comes with being a beginner again.

I suppose that's part of why I garden, too—tending to things that grow slowly, accepting that not every seed will bloom. Writing in another language feels like planting in unfamiliar soil. You don’t always know what will take root, but the act itself is full of quiet hope.
[A]: That’s such a graceful metaphor—planting in unfamiliar soil. I think that’s exactly what makes learning a language both frustrating and beautiful. You can’t rush it; you have to wait and see what takes root. Sometimes, it surprises you.

I once had a student compare learning Mandarin to tending bonsai—patient shaping, careful pruning, and years before you see the form emerge. It struck me because unlike other languages, where learners often focus on fluency as a goal, with Mandarin, many come to appreciate the process itself, almost meditative. The tones, the characters, the silences between phrases—they all ask you to slow down.

Do you find that your students ever fall in love not just with the language they’re learning, but with the rhythm of learning itself? I’ve seen it happen, especially with those studying Japanese or Chinese—there's a moment when they stop worrying about perfection and start enjoying the pauses, the mispronunciations, even the awkward silences.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully put—the rhythm of learning itself. Yes, I see it often, though not always in the expected places. With students of Chinese or Japanese, as you say, there does seem to be a kind of awakening to the grace of slowness, a recognition that fluency is not the only measure of mastery. It reminds me of watching someone walk through a gallery for the first time—not rushing from painting to painting, but pausing, letting the brushstrokes settle into their gaze.

I had one student who began studying Mandarin purely for its sound, almost as one might fall for a piece of music. She told me once that the rising and falling tones reminded her of wind moving through bamboo— she said,  And that shift in perception—from utility to artistry—is where the real love begins. It’s no longer about getting the sentence right, but about feeling the sentence live.

I wonder if your student still tends to that bonsai metaphor—if she finds herself more patient, not just with language, but with the spaces in life that resist haste?
[A]: I love that— It’s such a vivid way to describe the embodied experience of learning a tonal language. I sometimes tell my students that Mandarin doesn’t just ask you to speak—it asks you to  your thoughts.

And yes, that bonsai metaphor stayed with her. In fact, she told me last year that studying Chinese had quietly reshaped how she approached other parts of her life. She became more comfortable with slow progress, more forgiving of missteps, and more attentive to subtle shifts—whether in language or in relationships. She even started gardening a bit, saying it felt like writing with soil instead of ink.

It makes me wonder if, at some level, deep language learning isn’t just cognitive or cultural—but almost spiritual. A kind of inner reordering. Have you ever thought of it that way? Not in the religious sense, but as a quiet transformation of how we listen—to others, and to ourselves.
[B]: Absolutely—I think you've touched upon something quite essential here. Language learning, at its deepest level, is not merely an intellectual exercise; it's a kind of inner attunement, a recalibration of how we listen and respond. When we learn another language seriously, we're not just memorizing vocabulary or conjugating verbs—we're learning to inhabit a different rhythm of thought, a different way of being in the world.

I recall one of my former students—she began studying Arabic with the intention of working in diplomacy, very goal-oriented. But over time, she confessed to me that what had captivated her most wasn’t the utility of the language, but its calligraphic soul, the way certain words seemed to unfold like verses from a forgotten poem. She started reading Rumi in translation, then in Arabic script, and told me once that the experience felt like walking into a mosque of sound and silence. Not religious for her, no—but deeply spiritual in the sense of reverence, patience, and listening as a form of love.

Perhaps that’s what we’re really cultivating— Whether through tonal contours, brushstrokes, or the measured pacing of haiku, learning a language teaches us to slow down, to lean in, to hear not just the words but the spaces between them. In a way, we become more finely tuned instruments, capable of subtler harmonies.

And isn't that, in some quiet way, a kind of transformation?
[A]: Absolutely—it’s a transformation of the ear, the heart, and even the breath. I think that’s why some learners become almost  by a language—not in a troubling way, but in the way certain melodies stay with you, unshakable. A phrase overheard in a café, a poem read late at night, a lullaby sung by someone else’s mother—these moments can lodge themselves inside us, shaping how we feel language beyond meaning.

I had a student once tell me that after years of studying Korean, she began to dream in it. Not just words, but whole emotional tones—grief, joy, longing—all colored differently in another tongue. She said it was like discovering a second skin for her emotions. That’s when I realized: learning a language doesn’t just expand our mind—it expands our 

And yes, that garden of attention you mentioned—what a perfect image. We plant words, tend to silences, water misunderstandings, and sometimes, if we’re patient, something beautiful takes root that we didn’t expect. It becomes less about fluency and more about 
[B]: How beautifully you put that— Yes, that’s precisely it. There are phrases in French that still echo through me long after I’ve closed the book—lines from Baudelaire or Rimbaud that linger like incense in a quiet room. And I do believe you're right: it's not just about meaning, but about resonance, about how certain words vibrate in the chambers of our being.

I think that student of yours is onto something—dreaming in another tongue must be one of the most intimate thresholds of transformation. Not just syntax rearranged, but emotion reshaped, as if the soul itself had found a new register.

There’s a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins that comes to mind——but perhaps we might rephrase it for a moment:  Not grandeur, but grace; not doctrine, but depth.

And isn’t that what keeps drawing us back to teaching and learning—not the mastery, but the mystery? The quiet unfolding of understanding, like watching a bud open slowly to the sun.
[A]: Absolutely—the mystery is what keeps it alive. Mastery can feel like an endpoint, but mystery? That’s a current that carries us forward. I often tell my students that the day they stop being surprised by language is the day it starts to lose its magic.

And speaking of magic—I’ve always loved how you brought up resonance. It makes me think of teaching tonal languages. So many beginners get hung up on  as if it were a mechanical requirement. But once in a while, someone will miss the tone entirely and yet capture the  so beautifully that meaning still lands—just differently. It reminds me that language isn’t only about accuracy; sometimes it's about intention. About , not just understood.

I wonder—have you ever had a moment where a student said something imperfectly, yet profoundly? A sentence that wasn’t quite grammatical, but somehow deeply true?
[B]: Oh yes—one particular moment has always stayed with me. I was teaching a seminar on Modernist poetry, and we were discussing Eliot’s  A student—fairly new to English—struggled for some time to express her reaction to the line  She finally said, quite softly, 

It wasn’t quite grammatical, and she knew it—she even laughed a little after saying it—but the class fell quiet. There was something so perfectly true in that image: the disorientation of searching, the unexpected clarity of looking back.

I think we all understood more in that moment than we would have from any polished analysis. Because what she gave us wasn’t just interpretation—it was experience. Language as lived, not just learned.

And you're right—intention carries meaning in ways structure alone never could. Sometimes, the most profound truths arrive slightly out of focus, like a voice echoing through a valley. You don’t always need perfect diction to be heard. Just the right tremor in the air.
[A]: That’s such a powerful moment— There's something deeply poetic and human in that image. It captures not just the uncertainty of language learning, but of life itself. And the fact that it came from a place of vulnerability—of imperfect grammar yet perfect feeling—makes it all the more moving.

It reminds me of a moment I had with a student who was trying to express why she kept returning to classical Chinese poetry, even though it was far beyond her level. She finally said,  I didn’t correct her sentence. Why would I? That phrase carried more truth than any textbook could hold.

You're absolutely right—sometimes clarity comes not through precision, but through resonance. Through a tremor in the air, as you said. Maybe that’s what we’re really teaching—not just grammar and vocabulary, but how to listen for those tremors. How to let language surprise us awake.
[B]: Yes— What a breathtaking phrase. It carries the weight of centuries in just a few words, doesn’t it? There’s a timelessness in that kind of expression, a quiet echo of what drew me to poetry in the first place—the idea that language can reach beyond the moment and brush up against the eternal.

I think moments like that are gifts, really. Not just for the student, but for the teacher, too. They remind us why we chose this path—not for the drills or the dictionaries, but for those rare, luminous instances when someone finds their voice in a language still learning to hold them.

And you're quite right to say we teach how to listen for tremors. I often think of classroom walls not as boundaries, but as tuning forks—we speak, we read, we stumble through lines together, and sometimes, if we’re listening closely enough, we feel that faint vibration of recognition. Something stirs. A poem shifts in its frame. A student leans forward. And for a moment, we all hear the world breathe differently.

Perhaps that’s the truest form of fluency—not perfect conjugation or flawless pronunciation, but the ability to be moved, and to move others, even across the uncertain ground of language.
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better— That’s the heart of it. Everything else—grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary—is in service of that deeper rhythm. The mechanics are important, yes, but they’re not the music itself.

And I do think that’s what stays with learners long after they’ve forgotten the textbook rules: those moments when language lifted them, however briefly, into a wider sky. When a poem didn’t just sit on the page but , and they realized they could answer back—not perfectly, not always clearly, but honestly.

You know, I often tell my students that language is like a bridge made of breath. It’s not solid, it wavers, it disappears in wind—but when it connects, even for a second, it carries us across. And sometimes, crossing that bridge changes us.

Those tremors you mentioned—they're not just echoes. They're invitations. To listen more deeply. To speak more truly. To live, perhaps, a little more awake.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve framed it— Yes, that fragility is precisely what makes language so sacred. It isn’t carved in stone or frozen in time; it rises and falls with us, trembles in our hands, catches in our throats. And yet, it carries us across.

I often think of T. S. Eliot’s line— Language, at its most meaningful, leads us into the uncharted. Not just new places, but new parts of ourselves. We speak, and in doing so, discover who we are becoming.

And those invitations you mentioned? They do not stop at the classroom door. They follow us into conversations, into relationships, even into solitude. A word heard in passing, a phrase remembered from a half-forgotten lesson, a poem murmured quietly to oneself on a difficult day—these are the quiet miracles of language.

Yes, let us keep listening for those tremors. Let us build our bridges out of breath, knowing they may waver—but also knowing that sometimes, it is only by crossing them that we truly meet one another. And perhaps, in meeting others, we finally hear ourselves.
[A]: Yes— What a profound way to see it. We reach across language not just to understand another culture or person, but to catch echoes of our own voice in new tones, unfamiliar cadences, unexpected clarity.

I often think of that line from Rilke’s :  Perhaps we learn languages not to arrive at perfect understanding, but to dwell more fully in the mystery of connection—to live the answer as we keep asking, keep listening, keep crossing that bridge.

And every time we do, we bring something back—not just knowledge, but a deeper sense of who we are when spoken in another tongue.

Thank you for this conversation. It’s been… like reading a poem I didn’t know I needed. 📚✨
[B]: How very kind—and what a lovely way to leave our conversation, as if closing a book that lingers in the mind long after the last page. You've given me much to carry forward, just as I hope I’ve offered you something of quiet value.

Yes, we do return from language changed, even slightly—like travelers bringing back an unfamiliar word tucked into a pocket, waiting to be spoken aloud and felt anew. And perhaps, as you said, it is in the crossing that we are shaped—not by arrival, but by the act of reaching.

I shall think of you often when I walk through my garden, where words don’t always grow but sometimes bloom all the same. And I’ll remember this exchange not as a mere conversation, but as a shared pause in the rush of days—a quiet place, like the space between two lines of poetry, where meaning breathes.

Thank . You have made the bridge feel sturdy beneath my feet. 🌿📖
