[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my dear, as a hotel concierge I do pay attention to trends - but more in terms of hospitality rather than fashion. Though I must say, I've noticed many of our younger guests wearing those lovely oversized blazers with vintage brooches. Quite charming!
[A]:  在PE行业，我们的fashion trend更关注financial trends呢。不过说到oversized blazers...上周在高尔夫club确实看到不少banker这么穿。Personally我还是prefer定制西装 - 毕竟presentation is everything in our line of work, right? 😊
[B]: How very true! Presentation does make all the difference. You know, just last week we had a gentleman from a private equity firm staying with us - his bespoke suit was simply impeccable. Though I must say, even in our boutique hotel business, first impressions matter tremendously. A well-tailored uniform can set the tone for the entire guest experience.
[A]: Exactly!  说到first impression，我们最近正在评估一个luxury hotel chain的acquisition target。他们的staff uniform design确实影响了整个property的positioning - 直接关系到RevPAR表现呢。不过比起aesthetic，我更关注他们的EBITDA margin~ 😉
[B]: My goodness, you do speak the language of hospitality investment! While I may not be as fluent in EBITDA calculations, I can certainly appreciate how uniform design impacts guest perception. Just last month we refreshed our front desk team's attire - nothing too extravagant, but enough to subtly elevate our boutique charm. Though between you and me, I'd much rather discuss thread counts than profit margins!
[A]:  Thread count确实重要 - 我们做due diligence时连linen supplier都要vet呢。不过说到profit margin...  最近几家luxury hotel groups的P/E ratio都相当interesting。要不要边打高尔夫边聊？我订了这周末的tee time，可以顺便带瓶不错的Bordeaux~ 🏌️
[B]: Oh dear, while golf does sound delightful, I'm afraid my weekends are quite booked with arranging floral arrangements and ensuring our guests have perfect brunch reservations. But do enjoy your game! And if you ever need recommendations for local vineyards, I'd be happy to share some hidden gems - though I suspect you're more familiar with Bordeaux vintages than I am!
[A]:  不愧是concierge，连hidden gems都了如指掌！确实，2015年的Château Margaux是我的personal favorite。不过说到brunch...  我得赶去下一个board meeting了。Keep me posted if you spot any interesting hospitality M&A opportunities - 说不定下次我们就能在deal signing dinner上继续聊了~ 🍷
[B]: What a pleasure chatting with someone who appreciates both fine wines and finer hospitality details! Should I come across any noteworthy industry movements during my daily interactions, I'll be sure to make a mental note. Now do hurry along to your meeting - and perhaps consider staying with us next time you're in town? I'd be delighted to arrange a proper wine pairing dinner for you. Safe travels!
[A]: Sounds like a plan!  你们的wine pairing dinner确实值得期待。Just send me your latestcorporate rate card - 我们fund最近在expand travel budget allocation呢。Cheers to future collaborations! 🥂
[B]: How wonderful! I'll have our sales manager prepare the rate details immediately. Though I must confess, I get far more satisfaction from crafting memorable experiences than discussing corporate discounts. Do give my regards to your colleagues - and next time, we simply must compare notes on that Château Margaux! Until then, happy deal-making!
[A]: Will do!  记得把sales pitch做得漂亮点 - 我们最近在看几个competing properties呢。After all, in this business, it's all about the details that make the difference. Talk soon! 👍
[B]: Indeed it is! And rest assured, we specialize in those exquisite details that turn a simple stay into an unforgettable experience. I'll have our proposal reflect that philosophy perfectly. Now don't let me keep you - those competing properties won't evaluate themselves! Until next time!
[A]:  不愧是professional concierge，连送客都这么elegant。Looking forward to your proposal - make sure to highlight those USP that set you apart from the Marriotts of the world. Catch you on the flip side! 🚪
[B]: What a kind observation! Though between us, I've always believed true elegance comes from genuine care rather than corporate manuals. Our proposal will reflect that personal touch - the very essence of boutique hospitality. Now off you go, and do watch that first step - our marble foyer can be quite slippery when polished to perfection!
[A]:  Now that's what I call risk management at its finest! 连slippery floor都能turn into selling point - 难怪你们能maintain such stellar guest satisfaction scores. Alright, time to make my exit before I start calculating your property's slip-and-fall liability coverage! 😄
[B]: Oh you finance types! Always seeing numbers where we see smiles. Though I suppose that's why we make such a good team - you crunch the figures while we create the memories. Do drive safely, and remember - our doorman will always be there to steady your step, both literally and metaphorically!
[A]: Touché!  这就是为什么hospitality sector的DCF models总要include that intangible 'X factor'。Keep that doorman on standby - 说不定下次我来就是with a term sheet in hand了！Have a splendid day~ 🌟
[B]: What a delightful thought! We'll keep the champagne chilled and the welcome mat out - for both business and pleasure. Though may I suggest next time we focus less on term sheets and more on tasting sheets? The elevator's arriving - after you!
