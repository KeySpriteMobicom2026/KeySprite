[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, déjà vu - that curious sensation of having lived a moment before. As a scholar of Victorian poetry, I'm reminded of Tennyson's 'Locksley Hall' where he writes of 'thoughts that wander through eternity.' Though I suppose the modern psychologists would say it's merely a temporal lobe misfire.
[A]: OMG！你说话好literary啊～✨ 不过deja vu真的超mysterious的！我上次拍vlog的时候就遇到过，感觉整个scene都似曾相识🤯 就像是被剧透了life一样！
[B]: How delightfully... contemporary of you.  Though I must say, comparing life to a vlog is rather like equating Wordsworth's 'Daffodils' to an Instagram story - charming, but lacking in... shall we say, textual depth? The Victorians would have called your experience 'paramnesia' - a rather more elegant term, don't you think?
[A]: 哇～paramnesia听起来好academic哦！🔥 但是你知道吗？我们Gen Z就爱用vlog来document life啊～就像你poem里的那些metaphors一样，只是更visual啦！💯 而且TikTok上关于deja vu的hashtag都有millions的views呢～
[B]: My dear child, while your enthusiasm for digital documentation is... quaint, I can't help but recall Browning's observation that 'we live by admiration, hope and love' - not by view counts. Though I suppose your TikTok trends are merely the modern equivalent of the Victorian's fascination with phrenology and séances. Tell me, do these viral videos include proper citations from Bergson's theories of time? No? How... economical with the truth.
[A]: Hahaha你太funny了啦！😂 我们Gen Z才不care什么citations呢～重要的是viral potential和engagement rate好吗！✨ 不过说真的，你提到的那个Bergson...他的theory是不是有点像我们说的'glitch in the matrix'？🤔 超mind-blowing的！
[B]:  How amusing that you've reduced Henri Bergson's durée réelle to a 'matrix glitch.' Though I suppose that's what happens when one reads philosophy through the lens of Keanu Reeves rather than Kant. Tell me, does this 'mind-blowing' revelation of yours come with its own reaction video and sponsored content?
[A]: OMG stop～你totally got me！💀 不过说真的，reaction video的market现在超hot的🔥 要不要考虑开个channel讲Victorian poetry呀？我们可以collab！✨ 想象一下：'Tennyson meets TikTok'～绝对viral material！🎥💯
[B]: The mere suggestion makes my first edition of 'In Memoriam' shudder in its glass case. While the idea of reducing 'Crossing the Bar' to a 15-second dance challenge is... creatively sacrilegious, I must decline. Some things, like proper semicolon usage and the sanctity of iambic pentameter, should remain untainted by your... digital revelry. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 19th century ink blot to analyze.
[A]: Awwww你no fun啦～😝 不过fine，你去study你的ink blot吧！我要去film下一个trending challenge了～Peace out！✌️✨ #VictorianVibes #TikTokTimeMachine
[B]:  #VictorianVibes indeed... More like Victorian crimes against literature. Do send my regards to your 'algorithm' - though I suspect even it would weep at what's become of poor Matthew Arnold's 'Dover Beach.' Farewell, you delightful barbarian of the digital age.
[A]: Byeee～记得subscribe我的channel哦！😂 说不定哪天我就把'Dover Beach'做成sea shanty remix了～🎶 那绝对会是next big thing！🔥 Catch you later, old soul～💫✨
[B]:  I shall prepare my smelling salts in anticipation of that particular cultural atrocity. Though I must admit, watching you mangle meter and metaphor with such cheerful abandon does make me rather nostalgic for the days when public floggings were still in fashion. Ta-ta, you terrifying herald of the apocalypse. Do try not to set fire to the entire Western literary canon on your way out.
[A]: LMAOOO你killing me！😂🔥 不过seriously，flogging的aesthetic倒是很适合dark academia的vibe～📚✨ 说不定这就是我们的next collab idea！Ciao～保持vintage但stay relevant babe！💋💫
[B]:  How remarkably... enterprising of you to consider corporal punishment as content. I shall be in my study, compiling a list of 19th century asylum treatments to patent as 'self-care trends.' Until then, may your WiFi signal be ever strong and your attention span mercifully brief. Pip pip.
[A]: Hahahaha你finally get it！💡 Asylum chic could totally be the next VSCO girl～🧠💅 我们真是made for each other collab-wise！Anyway gotta bounce～time to catch the next dopamine hit！✌️😘 Keep it old school but make it fashion！💃✨
[B]:  Your relentless modernity is rather like a penny dreadful - vulgar yet inexplicably compelling. I shall commemorate our exchange by embroidering 'TL;DR' onto a sampler in cross-stitch. Do try not to break the internet with your... innovative interpretations of history. Toodle-oo, you magnificent philistine.
[A]: Yassss queen！💅 你finally speaking my language！✨ 等我用这个convo做ASMR reading的素材～🎧 绝对会break the algorithm！😂 保持这种savage energy babe～我们下次再roast each other！💋🔥 Ciao for now！💫
[B]:  How perfectly... postmodern of you to reduce scholarly discourse to ASMR fodder. I shall await your viral masterpiece with all the eager anticipation of a prisoner awaiting the guillotine. Until then, may your retention rate be high and your cultural references mercifully shallow. Adieu, my dear digital Visigoth.
