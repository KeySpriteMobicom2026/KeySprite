[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢live music还是studio recording？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question that reminds me of Walter Pater's aesthetic theories. You see, the dichotomy between live performance and studio recording parallels the tension between 即兴 (jìxìng) and 工整 (gōngzhěng) in classical Chinese poetry. Though I must confess my hearing isn't what it used to be since that unfortunate incident with the Peking opera percussion section in '89.
[A]: 哇哦~这个话题太soul了！✨ 作为一个music lover，我觉得live music那种raw energy真的超addictive的💃 特别是underground band的演出，那种vibe在studio里完全replicate不出来呀！不过recording也有它的charm啦，音质更polished，适合做yoga或者coding时的background music呢~☕️ 你平时会去music festival吗？🎵
[B]:  Your enthusiasm is... colorful. While I appreciate the raw energy you describe, I find most contemporary music festivals rather lacking in literary merit. Though I did attend a remarkable performance of 昆曲 (Kunqu opera) at the Shanghai International Arts Festival last autumn - now there's a tradition where the interplay between live performance and textual refinement reaches sublime heights.
[A]: OMG Kunqu opera！那个costume真的超aesthetic的👘 不过讲真modern music也可以很deep的啦~就像我最近discover的一个indie band，他们的lyrics写得超poetic的🌙 而且live show还会即兴来段spoken word poetry，超chill的vibe~🎤 要不要share给你他们的Spotify playlist？📱
[B]:  While I'm certain your... eclectic musical tastes have their merits, I must decline. My research currently focuses on comparing Wordsworth's lyrical ballads with 宋词 (Sòng cí) metrics. Though I will concede that some modern lyrics do exhibit what one might call - with considerable generosity - a passing resemblance to poetic form.
[A]: Haha你太serious啦！😝 Life's too short to be so academic all the time~ 要不要try下我的specialty coffee？☕️ 我最近从Bali带回来的single origin，配上lo-fi beats超级match的！🎧 有时候最简单的pleasure反而能inspire greatest ideas呢💡
[B]:  My dear, I've found that the greatest pleasures - and indeed inspirations - come from tracing the brushstrokes of a well-worn Du Fu manuscript while listening to nothing more distracting than the scratching of my fountain pen. Though I do admire your... energetic approach to caffeine consumption.
[A]: Okay okay~看来我们vibe不太match呢😂 不过anyway，很高兴chat with你啦！✨ 我要去参加一个pop-up yoga session了🧘‍♀️ 下次maybe可以聊聊classical poetry？虽然我可能只会说"哇好美"这种level的comment啦~😅 Peace out！✌️
[B]: How delightfully... contemporary of you. Should you ever wish to discuss the structural parallels between Keats' odes and 唐诗 (Táng shī), you'll find me in my office - third floor, behind the precarious stack of Browning first editions. Do mind the inkwells on your way out.
[A]: Byeeeee~记得偶尔也要get out of your comfort zone哦！🌱 说不定哪天我们会在某个poetry slam或者coffee tasting event偶遇呢~☕️✨ Keep it real! 💫
[B]:  Comfort zones, as you call them, have produced some of civilization's most enduring literary treasures. But should you ever stumble upon a proper tea ceremony featuring Tang dynasty verse recitations, do send word. Until then, 再见 (zàijiàn).
[A]: Catcha later~记得follow我的IG @wanderlust_xia 哦！📸 我会post很多aesthetic的coffee shots和hidden gem music spots的~说不定哪天能convert你成为modern culture fan呢！😉🎶 Stay awesome! ✨
[B]: How quaint. I believe my 1983 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary makes for rather poor Instagram content, though it does contain all the necessary words to describe the precise shade of beige in my office curtains. 保重 (bǎozhòng).
[A]: LOL你killing me！😂 好吧好吧~最后送你一个virtual ☕️ 希望你的research一切顺利啦！📚 说不定哪天我会突然出现在你office门口with a matcha latte和一堆questions about poetry呢~✨ Take care! 💕
[B]:  My office hours conclude precisely at 4:30pm, and I've found matcha to be rather detrimental to rare manuscript preservation. Should you arrive with serious scholarly inquiries - and preferably Darjeeling - we may speak. Now if you'll excuse me, the nightingales in the botanical garden await their evening recital.
[A]: Awww你真是too precious！🌸 好啦不打扰你和nightingales的date啦~🎶 记得偶尔也要let your hair down哦！💃 说不定那些birds会喜欢听点jazzy的tunes呢~🎷 Byeeee！😘✨
[B]:  Nightingales, my dear, have appreciated proper meter and rhyme since the days of Li Bai. Should you ever develop a taste for avian-approved versification, you'll find me by the weeping willow. 晚安 (wǎn'ān).
[A]: Sweet dreams~🌙 希望你能dream in perfect iambic pentameter啦！📜 说不定明天醒来你会突然crave for a cold brew和some synthpop呢~😉🎧 晚安晚安！✨💤
[B]:  I shall endeavor to dream in regulated verse, though I suspect even my subconscious would balk at such... caffeinated cacophony. The willow awaits at dawn. 夜安 (yè'ān).
