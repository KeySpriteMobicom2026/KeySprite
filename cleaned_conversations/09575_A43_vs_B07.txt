[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh hey，说到shocking的historical fact，我前段时间读到一个关于咖啡历史的冷知识，简直让我惊掉下巴！你知道吗，在17世纪的欧洲，咖啡曾经被认为是“伊斯兰教的邪恶发明”，甚至被部分基督教地区称为“魔鬼的饮料”☕️。后来连教皇都出面开会讨论要不要ban it！

不过有意思的是，传说当时的教皇亲自尝了一口咖啡后直接被圈粉，说这东西太棒了，还给它取了个名字叫"liquid amber"，从此咖啡在天主教世界里才正式获得合法地位。

对了，你最近有没有读到什么让你觉得Wow的历史故事？我觉得这种小众的知识真的超级有意思~
[A]: Ah, fascinating! That’s one of the most intriguing examples of how cultural & religious biases can shape perceptions of something as simple as a beverage. Speaking of shocking history, I recently came across a rather dark chapter related to tea—yes, tea! Did you know that during the 19th century, the British East India Company went to great lengths to keep their monopoly on tea trade, even resorting to smuggling and manipulating local politics in China?

One particularly twisted detail is how they used a form of economic warfare—flooding the Chinese market with opium from India to balance their massive tea imports. It eventually led to the Opium Wars, which had devastating consequences for China. It's eerie how a drink so associated with tranquility in many Eastern traditions was indirectly tied to such violent conflict. History sure has a way of surprising us, doesn’t it? 😊  
By the way, do you see any parallels between that period and today’s global commodity dynamics?
[B]: Wow, that’s such a powerful reminder of how commodities can become tools of power—and destruction. The irony is palpable, right? Tea, which is so deeply tied to peace and ritual in places like China & Japan, was quietly wrapped up in something so violent. It really makes you think twice about what’s behind the things we consume every day🌿.

And yeah, I do see some parallels today, honestly. While it’s not quite as overtly colonial, there’s still so much manipulation in global supply chains—like how certain countries are kept in dependency when it comes to coffee. Big corporations sometimes control prices & markets in ways that keep small farmers struggling, even if they’re the ones doing the real work.

It’s one reason why I’m so passionate about direct trade & transparency. When I source beans, I try to go beyond just “fair trade certified”—I want to know the farmer’s story, their challenges, their dreams. It’s a small step, but maybe it’s part of a bigger shift toward more ethical consumption?

Do you feel like consumers today are becoming more aware of these dynamics, or do you think it’s still a niche concern?
[A]: Hmm, thoughtful question. I do believe there’s a growing awareness—especially among younger generations—who approach consumption with a more critical eye. Terms like , , and  are no longer confined to academic papers or niche activism; they’re entering mainstream discourse. Yet, as you said, it’s still somewhat of a niche movement. The majority of consumers, unfortunately, remain detached from the geopolitical realities behind their daily cup of coffee or tea.

What fascinates me is how literature & history can play a role in awakening that consciousness. For example, reading about the Opium Wars through Chinese sources rather than just British colonial narratives changes your perspective entirely. It's similar with coffee—when you read oral histories from Ethiopian farmers or letters from 17th-century Dutch traders, you start seeing the human cost embedded in these commodities.

I wonder, have you ever introduced your coffee partners—farmers or cooperatives—to literature or historical texts that reflect their own reality? Sometimes, giving voice to their stories within an intellectual framework can be a powerful act of reclamation. 🌱
[B]: That’s such a deep and thoughtful take—thank you for sharing that perspective. You know, it actually reminds me of something I started doing a couple of years ago with a co-op in Colombia. We began hosting what I call “storytelling brew sessions” where we not only taste the coffee but also read short excerpts from writings connected to the region—sometimes poems by local authors, sometimes translated oral histories from the farmers’ own families.

At first, I wasn’t sure how it would land, but the response has been beautiful. One farmer told me,  That hit me right in the heart☕️.

I think you’re absolutely right—when we embed these human stories into our everyday rituals, it adds layers of meaning that go beyond ethics or sustainability. It becomes about dignity, memory, and connection. Sometimes just reading a sentence written by someone who lived 100 years ago, on the very same soil, changes the way we sip our coffee.

I’d actually love to do more of this with different origins—maybe even invite writers or historians to collaborate. Have you ever thought about curating something like that in a café or workshop setting?
[A]: What a beautiful practice—… I love how you’ve turned coffee tasting into a kind of literary & historical immersion. It reminds me of the Chinese tradition of  (雅集), literati gatherings where poetry, tea, and brush painting were shared in harmony. The idea that a simple act like drinking coffee can become a bridge across time, place, and identity—it's poetic, really.

I have indeed thought about curating something similar, though perhaps with a slightly academic twist. Imagine a small evening workshop where we pair a particular text—a short story, a letter, maybe even a translated folk tale—with a coffee from the same region or era. We could read a passage aloud, then sip while reflecting on it together. No lectures, no jargon—just conversation sparked by words and flavor. Maybe even invite a local writer or historian to join occasionally, as you suggested.  

I’d be honored to collaborate with you on something like this, if you’re open to it. Perhaps start with a pilot session—maybe focus on one origin, one story, one roast? Ethiopia has such a rich literary & oral tradition; it could be a meaningful place to begin. What do you think? 🤔
[B]: That sounds absolutely magical—like, seriously, my heart just did a little happy dance 🌿. Pairing the richness of coffee with the richness of words? It’s like we’re not just tasting beans, we’re sipping on time itself.

Ethiopia would be  a beautiful origin to start with. I actually have a good friend who’s a poet and translator based in Addis Ababa—she’s done some stunning work bringing Oromo oral stories into English. If we wanted to go that route, I’m sure she’d be up for collaborating or even joining virtually. Imagine reading an ancient folktale while tasting a Yirgacheffe with citrus & jasmine notes—it’s like the flavors would suddenly have a soul, you know?

I’m totally down for co-hosting something like this with you. Let’s dream it into shape together ✨. Maybe we could call it something like… ? Or ? Hmm, open to your poetic flair too 😄.

And hey, if the pilot goes well, who knows—maybe we can take it on the road someday, literally or digitally. A global toast through stories & sips. What a beautiful way to connect people across borders, right?
[A]: I can feel the excitement in your words—it’s contagious! ✨ The idea of  really captures the essence of what we’re trying to create: a space where history, literature, and sensory experience converge. I love how it evokes both the groundedness of coffee and the fluidity of memory.

And a virtual guest from Addis Ababa? That would add such a rich layer—having that living voice connect us directly to the soil, the stories, the soul of the place. It brings authenticity and depth that no textbook or curated summary could ever replicate.

Let’s go with , if you're okay with it. I’ll start drafting a loose framework—maybe a 90-minute session, beginning with a short welcome ritual: grinding the beans together as participants arrive (if in person), or sharing a brief cultural note about the origin if it’s online.

We could structure it like this:
1. A guided tasting with a historical or cultural context
2. A shared reading—poem, folk tale, or letter
3. Open reflection—how the words and flavors interact, what memories or thoughts arise
4. Optional creative prompt—invite participants to write a line or two inspired by the pairing

I think starting with Ethiopia gives us a strong foundation—not just because of its deep roots in both coffee and oral storytelling, but also because of how often its narratives have been overlooked or simplified in global discourse.

As for taking it on the road—digitally at first, perhaps? We could even partner with small cafés or bookshops in different cities to host satellite events under the same theme. A global simultaneity, sipping and reading across time zones… now  would be something special. 🌍✨

So yes—I’m all in. Shall we set a tentative date for the pilot? Maybe early next month?
[B]: I’m literally grinning from ear to ear right now—this is such an exciting moment 🌟.  feels like more than just a concept now; it’s becoming a living, breathing experience we’re about to invite others into.

I love your structure—simple, intentional, and full of space for personal reflection. There's something so powerful about giving people permission to sit quietly with a taste and a sentence, and just . And the creative prompt? Chef’s kiss 😍. It makes the session not just immersive, but participatory in a gentle, non-pressured way.

Virtual satellite events across cities and time zones? That gives me chills—in the best way. I can already picture it: someone in Seoul, another in Berlin, someone else in São Paulo, all holding a cup of Ethiopian coffee and a piece of its story in their hands at the same time. We’d be creating invisible threads of connection through flavor and language. So beautiful.

As for the date—I’m totally on board with early next month. Let’s lock it in around the second or third week. I’ll start prepping some sample bags and short origin stories for participants, and maybe design a little keepsake card with the day’s reading & tasting notes. Something tactile and lovely to hold onto after the session ends.

Let me know what dates work best for you, and I’ll clear my calendar around it. I have a feeling this is going to be the start of something really meaningful 🌿✨.
[A]: I’m right there with you—heart full, mind buzzing, palms slightly coffee-anxious with anticipation 😄. It’s rare to find a collaboration that feels this aligned, this purposeful. And yes,  is no longer just an idea—it's taking root.

The keepsake card is such a lovely touch; it transforms the experience into something people can carry with them. Maybe we can include a small prompt on the back—a question like,  or  Just a gentle nudge to keep the reflection going after the session ends.

I’m free any time after the 15th of next month—perhaps the 18th? Late afternoon my time would be perfect for a live event, and if we record it, folks in other time zones can still join in their own way later. I’ll start drafting a short blurb and reach out to a couple of literary-minded friends who might help spread the word through poetry or history networks.

And about your friend in Addis Ababa—would she be open to a quick chat beforehand? I’d love to understand her vision for the text selection and see how we can best support her voice in the session.

This is happening, isn’t it? 🤭  
A quiet revolution, one cup and one line at a time.
[B]: Absolutely, this is  happening—and I can already feel the energy building, like the moment right before the first sip ☕️✨.

The keepsake card idea with a reflective prompt on the back? Brilliant—exactly the kind of subtle nudge that keeps the experience alive long after the session ends. I’ll make sure it’s printed on recycled paper with a soft texture, something that feels good in your hands and invites a bit of lingering.

I’ll reach out to my friend in Addis today and see if she’s up for a quick chat—I think she’ll be thrilled to be part of something like this. Her name is Amina, and she has this way of speaking that makes even old parchment feel alive. I’m sure once you two connect, the text selection will flow naturally.

And the 18th sounds perfect. I’ll block that off now and start prepping a few sample bags—maybe even do a little “mystery origin” teaser on social media to build some curiosity 🌿. We can keep the official description tight and poetic, something like:

> Brewed in Time  
> A gathering for the senses and the soul.  
> Taste history. Read between the beans.  
> Let coffee open a door.

Let me know when you’re leaning toward time-wise (and if you want tea offered as an option too), and I’ll get the event page drafted. I have a feeling people are going to love stepping into this world we're making—one quiet cup, one shared line, at a time 🤍
[A]: That blurb? Perfection. It sets the tone without overexplaining—mysterious, inviting, just enough to stir curiosity. I can already picture it on a softly lit screen or printed on that textured card you mentioned.

As for time, let’s aim for 4:30 PM my time (which is late afternoon here)—it gives the session a kind of golden-hour feel, like we’re stepping out of the day for a moment. And yes, offering tea as an alternative makes sense; after all, both coffee and tea carry centuries of story in every cup. We can mention that choice in the tasting notes—something like,  Gentle, inclusive, and historically grounded.

I’ll start drafting a companion piece—a short reading list with one or two key texts from Ethiopia, maybe a translated folktale and a contemporary poem. Nothing too dense, just enough to ground us in the moment and place.

And when you reach out to Amina, would you mind including me in the message? I’d love to introduce myself and hear her thoughts directly. I’m especially curious about any lesser-known voices she feels deserve more attention—oral histories, perhaps, or women storytellers whose work hasn’t been widely translated.

This is more than an event now—it’s a quiet act of remembrance, isn’t it? To brew, to read, to sit with the past in the palm of our hands. 🤍

I’ll be in touch soon with the draft blurb and reading list. Thank you, truly, for bringing this vision to life with such care and heart.
[B]: You just gave me goosebumps again—thank you for that. There’s something so deeply moving about framing this as a . That’s exactly what it is. We’re not shouting into the void; we’re lighting small candles in shared spaces, letting people know that yes, stories still matter—and so do the hands that hold them.

I’ll reach out to Amina today and include you in the message. I know she’ll be touched by your thoughtful approach and your openness to voices that don’t always get translated or heard. Honestly, I think she’s going to love collaborating with you directly—it’ll give the session such a richer, more intimate soul.

And the time—4:30 PM it is. Golden hour, perfect. I’ll make sure the space feels warm and unhurried, whether folks join in person or online. I might even pull out my old Japanese kyusu teapot for the tea option—slow living vibes all around 🌿☕️.

I can’t wait to see the reading list you put together. Keep it light but meaningful, like you said—just enough to root us in place and time without weighing things down. I’ll match it with a short tasting profile that highlights not just flavor notes, but the regions and traditions behind them.

This is really happening. And honestly? It feels like the kind of thing that starts small and then ripples far beyond what we can imagine right now.

Thank you for dreaming this into being with me. I’m honored to brew it to life together. 🤍✨
[A]: You’ve captured it so beautifully—. That’s exactly what this is. And isn’t that, in many ways, the heart of literature? Of history? Of any meaningful human connection? We gather around these quiet flames, share warmth, and for a moment, we see each other more clearly.

I’m already imagining the atmosphere—your kyusu teapot steaming gently beside a freshly ground coffee bloom, voices from Ethiopia carried through speakers or read aloud in hushed tones, the scent of earth and citrus in the air. It will be intimate, thoughtful, alive.

Let’s keep the event description warm and open-ended, with just enough poetic texture to invite curiosity without confining meaning. I’ll send over my suggested reading list shortly—it’ll include a folktale about the origins of coffee in Kaffa (as told by storytellers in the region), and a contemporary poem that speaks to the movement of coffee across borders and centuries.

This  happening—and yes, I believe you're right. It will ripple outward in ways we can’t yet foresee. Because people are hungry for this: for slowness, for story, for something real beneath the noise.

Thank you, truly, for bringing your care, your craft, and your heart into this. I feel deeply fortunate to be co-creating  with you. 🤍✨
[B]: You’ve said it all so perfectly—I couldn’t have put it better myself. Yes, we  gathering around small flames, and in doing so, reminding each other that some things are worth slowing down for. Worth savoring. Worth passing on.

I’m already thinking about the lighting in the space—soft, warm, maybe a few candles flickering beside copies of the texts, just to reinforce that feeling of intimacy and ritual🌿. And the scent! I’ll do a slow roast of the Ethiopian beans just before the session starts, so people can really  the aroma as part of the story.

I love that your reading list includes both an origin folktale from Kaffa and a modern poem tracing coffee’s journey—it creates such a beautiful arc, doesn’t it? From forest to cup, from soil to soul.

When you send over the list, I’ll build the tasting profile around those same themes: geography, movement, memory. I want every sip to feel like a quiet step deeper into the narrative.

And the event description? Let’s keep it just as you said—warm, poetic, open-ended. A gentle invitation, not a lecture. Something like:

> Brewed in Time  
> A gathering for readers, drinkers, and dreamers.  
> We invite you to step into a shared moment where stories steep and time softens.  
> Taste a place. Hear its voice.  
> Whether your cup holds coffee or tea, there is space here for you.

Let me know when you’re ready to send the readings and I’ll weave them into the flow. I can’t wait to see this come together—you’ve brought such depth and intention to every detail. It’s a gift to create something meaningful with you. 🤍☕️✨
[A]: Ah, that event description? Sublime. It breathes invitation—no, it  it. Gentle, resonant, like the hush before a story begins. I can already hear it read aloud in someone’s warm voice as hands cradle cups and eyes soften into the moment.

I’ll send over the reading list shortly—it includes:
- A traditional folktale from Kaffa, recounting how a goatherd named Kaldi first noticed his energetic goats dancing after eating red berries (though you’d be surprised how many versions of this tale exist!);
- A beautifully translated poem by an Ethiopian writer whose name escapes English spelling but whose words linger long after the page is turned;
- And perhaps a short excerpt from a 20th-century travelogue written by an Ethiopian intellectual who journeyed through coffee-growing regions—not quite memoir, not quite ethnography, but something in between.

I love how your mind moves toward atmosphere—the scent of slow-roasted beans, the flicker of candlelight beside open pages. It reminds me of the old Chinese gatherings where ink was fresh, tea was poured with ceremony, and silence itself was considered part of the conversation.

Yes, let’s build the session like a poem:  
1. The aroma draws us in—curious, warm, unspoken.  
2. The taste deepens the mood—citrus, earth, memory.  
3. The reading gives it shape—voice, place, time.  
4. And then the quiet—where each person sits with what stirs inside.  

You’ve thought of everything, haven’t you? Not just the logistics, but the . That rare alchemy of care and craft.

When you’re ready with the tasting profile, I’ll weave in the readings to match the rhythm of the flavors. We’ll align them like verses in a quiet hymn.

This gathering will be more than an event—it will be a pause in the noise, a shared inhalation. And isn’t that what we all crave, in the end?

Thank you for tending this flame with such grace. 🤍☕️✨
[B]: You just painted the most beautiful picture in my head—of Kaldi’s goats, of ink stones and quiet pauses, of a room filled with people who are truly . That’s exactly the kind of atmosphere we’re brewing toward 🌿☕️.

I love how you framed the session like a poem—it’s so true. We’re not just pouring drinks; we’re guiding people through a sensory sonnet. And that rhythm you outlined? Perfection. Aromatic invitation, flavor revelation, narrative grounding, and then… silence. The kind where everything settles, and something new begins.

I’ll make sure the tasting profile mirrors that poetic arc. I’m thinking of starting with brightness—those citrus notes that wake up the senses—and slowly moving into deeper, earthier tones as the reading unfolds. Like a journey from sunlit highlands into the heartwood of memory.

And yes, please—send over the reading list whenever you're ready. I can already feel the travelogue excerpt adding such a rich layer, bridging oral tradition with modern reflection. I’ll build the tasting notes around those textures, so when someone reads aloud about winding mountain paths or bustling market sounds, their cup will echo the same landscape.

Let’s treat this event like a haiku—few words, deep meaning. Every detail matters, but none of it needs to be loud. Just warm. Just real.

I’m honestly still smiling at your line:   
Yes. Exactly that.

Thank you for bringing this kind of depth and soul to our collaboration. It means the world to me 🤍✨.
[A]: You’ve captured it so well—this idea of a gathering as a , each moment rhyming with the next. There’s something profoundly meditative in that structure, isn’t there? A rhythm that feels both intentional and effortless, like the turning of seasons or the way tea steeps best when left undisturbed.

I love how you’re mapping the tasting profile to the emotional arc—brightness first, then depth. It mirrors the way memory often works: sharp at the edges, soft in the center. That citrus spark awakening curiosity, followed by the grounding warmth of earth and wood. Perfect.

I’ll send over the full reading list shortly, but just to give you a preview:

- The Kaldi folktale weaves myth and discovery—how he noticed his goats dancing with joy under the moonlight after nibbling red berries. Versions differ, of course; some say a monk saw the same goats and brewed the first cup before dawn prayers, while others claim the berries were already known to hunters who needed endurance on long treks.

- The poem is by Aster Mengesha—its title in English reads “Coffee and the Moon,” though her words stretch far beyond translation. She writes about coffee not just as drink, but as a companion through exile, longing, and return.

- And the travelogue excerpt comes from the writings of Gebre Mesqel Lambo, a 20th-century Ethiopian thinker who traveled through the highlands documenting local customs. His account of a coffee ceremony in Wollega is both observational and deeply personal—he describes not only the preparation, but the silence between host and guest, the way time bends during the ritual.

Each piece carries its own tone, texture, and tempo. I think they’ll pair beautifully with your roast curve and narrative pacing.

Let’s make this session feel like breathing together for the first time in a long while—like rediscovering stillness, and finding meaning within it.

Thank  for holding space for this kind of quiet beauty. It’s rare, and precious. 🤍✨
[B]: Oh my heart—this reading list is  what I was hoping for 🌿🤍. Each piece you’ve chosen carries its own quiet power, and together, they form this beautiful constellation of myth, memory, and meaning.

The Kaldi story—however many versions may exist—is such a perfect opening. It’s like the origin myth of joy itself, isn’t it? Goats dancing under the moon, nature whispering secrets to those who pay attention. I can already picture people hearing that tale while catching the first bright notes of Yirgacheffe on their tongues—citrus spark, floral hum… a little taste of ancient wonder.

And Aster Mengesha’s ? That title alone gives me chills 😍. The idea of coffee as a companion through exile and return—it adds such emotional depth to the tasting experience. I’ll make sure we brew slowly during that part of the session, letting the aroma really bloom in the room. Like her words are settling into the air itself.

As for Gebre Mesqel Lambo’s travelogue excerpt—oh wow, yes. His attention to silence, to the way time bends during ceremony… that’s the exact moment where I imagine lowering the voice, slowing the pace, inviting everyone to just  with their cup for a beat. No rush. Just presence.

You’ve woven this so thoughtfully—I truly feel like every element will echo and amplify the other, like a well-tuned harmony. We’re not just sharing flavors or texts; we’re creating a space where people can  history, where they can taste poetry, where stillness becomes sacred.

I’ll start drafting the tasting profile now, aligning each note with the emotional journey you've laid out. Bright beginnings, earthy grounding, reflective silences. A sensory arc that mirrors the stories you're bringing us.

Thank , truly, for trusting this process and filling it with such soulful intention. You’ve helped shape something deeply meaningful here—and I know it’s going to touch everyone who joins us.

This is more than an event.  
It’s a shared breath.  
A quiet homecoming.  
And I’m honored to co-create it with you 🤍☕️✨.
