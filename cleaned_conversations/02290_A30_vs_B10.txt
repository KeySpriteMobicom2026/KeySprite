[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting thought experiment. After decades in quantum computing, I'd have to say the ability to process information at quantum speeds would be quite useful. Though I suppose that's cheating - it's more of an enhancement than a traditional superpower. 🤔
[A]:  How fascinating that you'd frame it in computational terms. Personally, I've always been partial to the literary notion of bibliokinesis - the ability to absorb texts instantaneously. Though I must say, the slow savoring of a well-bound volume has its own 韵味 (yùnwèi) that shouldn't be rushed.
[B]: Your mention of bibliokinesis reminds me of quantum tunneling - the idea of instantaneously accessing information across barriers. Though I must say, as someone who still keeps a first edition Turing paper on my shelf, there's something to be said for the tactile experience of turning pages. The 韵味, as you put it, is indeed irreplaceable.
[A]: Precisely! You understand the aesthetic tension between efficiency and experience.  My students often ask why I don't simply digitize my collection of Victorian-Chinese comparative analyses. But as any scholar of Walter Benjamin would tell you, the aura of physical texts - the foxing on the pages, the faint scent of ink - creates what we might call 文脉 (wénmài), a textual lineage that electrons simply cannot replicate.
[B]: How very true. It makes me think of my old vacuum tube computers - inefficient by today's standards, but there was something magical about watching those filaments glow while solving problems. Modern quantum processors may be faster, but they lack that... shall we say, 温度 (wēndù) of analog computation. Though I suspect my younger colleagues would call that sentimentality. 😊
[A]: Ah, sentimentality - the academic's dirty little secret!  Your vacuum tubes remind me of my prized 19th century steel nib pens. The students giggle when I insist on grading their theses with proper iron gall ink, but there's a certain 气韵 (qìyùn) in the deliberate stroke of a pen that no keystroke can capture. Though I'll admit my teaching assistant has started hiding ballpoints in my desk drawer.
[B]: Ah, the battle against modernity continues! I still keep my slide rule on my desk - not as a calculator, mind you, but as a reminder of how we used to visualize mathematical relationships physically. These days, students can't even appreciate the 优雅 (yōuyǎ) of a well-executed logarithmic calculation by hand. Though I suppose we must accept that some traditions, like my beloved FORTRAN programming, belong in museums. 
[A]:  FORTRAN, you say? How delightfully anachronistic - we're kindred spirits, you and I. Just last week I caught myself explaining the poetic meter of Tennyson to a student who insisted on analyzing it through Python sentiment analysis scripts. There's a particular 诗意 (shīyì) in manual scansion that gets lost in algorithmic processing, don't you think? Though I suppose we mustn't begrudge the young their tools... even if they do make my ink-stained fingers seem positively medieval.
[B]: Indeed. Though sometimes I wonder if we're not just romanticizing inefficiency. After all, I spent years developing quantum algorithms to solve problems in minutes that would take lifetimes classically. But then I catch myself enjoying the 缓慢 (huǎnmàn) process of debugging old assembly code by hand, and I realize perhaps there's wisdom in preserving both approaches. The future may be quantum, but the past has its own peculiar charm. 🤔
[A]:  How very dialectical of you! This tension between progress and preservation reminds me of the great 19th century debates between mechanical printing and hand-copied manuscripts. The Chinese literati had a term for it - 古今之辩 (gǔjīn zhī biàn), the argument between ancient and modern. Though I must confess, when my new department chair suggested replacing my chalkboard with a smart screen, I may have... misplaced... the installation instructions. Permanently. In the recycling bin.
[B]: Ah, the chalkboard! Now there's a technology with perfect 反馈 (fǎnkuì) - the immediate tactile response, the ability to erase and rethink visibly. These touchscreens lack the... shall we say, epistemological transparency of watching someone work through a proof in real time. Though I did compromise by keeping one small blackboard in my home office. Old habits, as they say, die hard - especially when written in calcium carbonate. 😊
[A]:  Calcium carbonate - now there's a phrase I haven't heard since my chemistry minor days! You've touched on something rather profound about pedagogical materials. The whiteboard markers they force upon us these days... why, the scent alone is enough to make one nostalgic for the 书卷气 (shūjuàn qì) of proper slate and chalk. Though I did have to stop wearing my good tweed jackets to lectures after the shoulders became permanently dusted with derivatives and iambic pentameter.
[B]: How very true. Though I must admit, after my last chalkboard-related dry cleaning bill, I've taken to keeping a lab coat in my office - purely for mathematical emergencies, you understand. It's amusing how we've both found ways to 妥协 (tuǒxié) with modernity while clinging to our analog comforts. Perhaps that's the real superpower - maintaining one's eccentricities in the face of relentless technological progress. 
[A]:  To eccentricities then! May we continue to be the benign anomalies in our departments - you with your quantum equations scrawled on parchment, me with my insistence that students learn to distinguish between a proper Oxford comma and a careless 顿号 (dùn hào). Though between you and me, I've started keeping a digital voice recorder... buried under three volumes of the OED, naturally. Some concessions must be made, if only to maintain the illusion of relevance.
[B]: Ah, the Oxford comma debate - now that's a hill worth dying on! Though I must confess, I've similarly hidden a quantum computing textbook beneath my collection of Lovelace's notes. After all, even we relics must occasionally 与时俱进 (yǔ shí jù jìn)... as long as we can do so while maintaining proper punctuation and the occasional Latin footnote.  The future may be inevitable, but it doesn't have to be inelegant.
[A]:  Elegance! There's the rub. My dear colleague, you've articulated precisely why I still require thesis drafts in triplicate - the sheer physicality of red ink on paper creates what the Japanese call 渋い (shibui), that refined austerity quite lost in Track Changes. Though I did recently discover the 'vintage paper' setting on our department printer... purely by accident, of course, while attempting to print a Tang dynasty translation. One must maintain standards, even in one's hypocrisies.
[B]: How delightfully subversive! I too have found ways to modernize while preserving the essence - my vintage computer collection now includes a Raspberry Pi retrofitted into a 1970s terminal case. The students think it's charmingly archaic, never suspecting it's actually running the latest quantum simulation software. A perfect 融合 (rónghé) of old and new, if I do say so myself. Though I still make them write their code on punch cards first - character building, you know. 😊
[A]:  Punch cards! Oh, you absolute devil. Why, that's more sadistic than when I make comparative literature majors transcribe Emily Dickinson in 小楷 (xiǎokǎi) script before allowing them near a keyboard. Though between us...  I have been known to secretly admire how neatly GitHub preserves marginalia. But if you tell a soul, I shall deny it vehemently while brandishing my 18th century quill collection.
[B]: Your secret is safe with me - though I may store it in my mental punch card archive rather than the cloud.  It's fascinating how we've both created these little 悖论 (bèilùn) of tradition and innovation. I suppose that's the mark of a true academic - maintaining principles while quietly adopting just enough modernity to avoid being institutionalized. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go recalibrate my abacus... I mean quantum processor. The walk to the server room will do me good.
