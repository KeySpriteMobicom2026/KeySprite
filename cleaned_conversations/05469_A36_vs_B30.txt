[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, manifestation... A rather modern repackaging of the Victorian 'law of attraction' concept, wouldn't you say? Though I must admit, when reading Wordsworth's 'The Prelude' alongside Tao Yuanming's poetry, one does observe intriguing parallels between Western romantic idealism and the Chinese 天人合一 philosophy.
[A]: Oh my, what an interesting perspective! You know, working at the boutique hotel, I've had guests from all over the world sharing their thoughts on manifestation. Some swear by it, while others... well, let's just say they prefer more concrete methods. Personally, I find Wordsworth's connection to nature quite charming - reminds me of our little rooftop garden here at the hotel.
[B]: How delightful that you maintain a rooftop garden! That reminds me of the university's greenhouse where I often contemplate the intersection of botany and literature. The guests at your establishment must find it quite restorative - though I'd caution against conflating Wordsworth's pantheism with contemporary manifestation theories. The Romantics were far more concerned with the sublime than with... shall we say, material acquisition.
[A]: You're absolutely right to make that distinction! Our guests do love the garden, though I always remind them it's more about finding peace than making wishes come true. Just yesterday, a lovely elderly couple from Cambridge spent hours there reading poetry together - now that's what I call true manifestation of happiness! Would you believe they left a volume of Wordsworth's poems at the front desk as a thank you?
[B]: Ah, now that's what I'd call a genuine moment of 缘分! How perfectly serendipitous that they left Wordsworth - though I do hope you'll check whether it's a first edition before letting housekeeping shelve it. My 19th century literature students would be horrified at the thought of a rare volume being exposed to hotel room humidity.
[A]: Oh dear, you've given me quite the fright! I'll have our head housekeeper handle that book with white gloves immediately. Though between you and me, I did peek at the inscription - it was a 1980s Penguin Classics edition, gifted to the couple on their honeymoon. Sometimes the sentimental value outweighs the monetary, don't you think? Like how our guests cherish handwritten notes more than printed confirmations.
[B]: Precisely! That reminds me of my prized possession - a dog-eared copy of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' with marginalia in three different hands spanning 1920s Shanghai to 1960s Hong Kong. The tea stains and pressed flowers between its pages tell more stories than the text itself. Though I must say, your hotel's attention to such details would make even Henry James' fastidious characters feel at home.
[A]: How wonderfully you put that! It makes me think we should start a little library nook in our lobby with books left by guests - complete with their personal notes and mementos inside. Though I'd have to insist on acid-free paper slips for new annotations, and perhaps some humidity-controlled display cases for the more delicate items. One must maintain standards, even while celebrating life's beautiful imperfections!
[B]: What a splendid proposal! Though may I suggest including both English and Chinese bookplates? The juxtaposition of Western ex libris traditions with Chinese 藏书票 practices could create fascinating cultural dialogues. Just last semester, we examined how Virginia Woolf's marginalia differed dramatically from Lu Xun's annotations - one full of tentative question marks, the other with decisive ink slashes. But do remember to keep the display cases away from direct sunlight - ultraviolet rays are the silent killers of paper, second only to careless hands holding teacups.
[A]: You've read my mind completely! We actually have the perfect spot near our afternoon tea area - indirect northern light and well away from any potential tea disasters. I'll consult with our local bookbinder about creating those bilingual bookplates you mentioned. And perhaps we could include a little guide explaining different annotation styles? Our international guests would adore learning about those cultural differences you described between Woolf and Lu Xun. Though I must say, we'll have to be strict about the no-tea-near-books rule - even if it breaks this Englishwoman's heart a little!
[B]: A small sacrifice for preservation's sake! Though I might recommend keeping a decoy teapot filled with book-safe herbal blends nearby - the psychological comfort of holding warm porcelain while reading is not to be underestimated. My graduate students swear by this trick during marathon research sessions. And if you'd like, I could draft that annotation guide - complete with cautionary tales about the time a first edition of 'Wuthering Heights' met its demise at the hands of an overzealous scholar's oolong tea.
[A]: What a brilliant compromise! A chamomile blend in fine china would satisfy both the soul and conservation needs. And I would be honored to display your annotation guide - perhaps with that cautionary tale as its centerpiece. It might even become our little library's most talked-about feature! Though I should warn you, if it's too entertaining, we may need to start serving tea in spill-proof cups after all. Some lessons, it seems, must be learned repeatedly - much like my staff's ongoing battle against guests using first editions as coasters!
[B]: Good heavens, the very thought of books as coasters makes my collection of Ming dynasty manuscript weights tremble in their display case! But your solution shows remarkable wisdom - much like the ancient Chinese practice of weighting scrolls with jade to prevent such calamities. Perhaps we could include that historical tidbit in the guide? Nothing deters modern carelessness quite like the weight of centuries-old tradition. Though I suspect your staff might need to develop the patience of Buddhist monks dealing with particularly... enthusiastic guests.
[A]: You're absolutely right - nothing commands respect like tradition! I'll have our calligrapher prepare a beautiful scroll about jade weights to hang above the display. And as for patience... well, let's just say working in hospitality has given my team the serenity of monks with excellent customer service smiles. Though between us, I do keep a stash of vintage coasters in my office, ready to discreetly swap out when I spot a guest reaching for a book with their teacup!
[B]: How wonderfully subversive! You're operating your own miniature cultural preservation society under the guise of hospitality. This reminds me of how we academics must sometimes... creatively reinterpret university budget codes to protect rare collections. But your method is far more elegant - the mark of a true professional. Just promise me you'll use those rescued books to start a 'survivors' shelf' with their stories discreetly noted in pencil. Future bibliophiles should know which volumes were saved from the great Tea Flood of 2024!
[A]: What a delightful idea! We'll call it our "Literary Survivors Club" - complete with tiny penciled notations about their narrow escapes. Though I might use our concierge code for "handle with care" rather than full confessions... must maintain some mystery for our guests to discover! And if you ever need to "creatively reinterpret" any university budgets for preservation projects, do remember we have excellent meeting rooms here - perfect for discreet planning over properly coastered tea service.
[B]: How perfectly clandestine! I shall keep your establishment in mind for our next... shall we say, 'alternative funding strategy session.' Though I must insist we use the term 'creative acquisition procedures' in any written correspondence. Academics, like your guests, appreciate a certain artful phrasing. And do remind me to bring my 19th century silver bookmark - it makes an excellent subtle pointer when discussing sensitive figures without leaving telltale fingerprints on documents.
[A]: Consider it noted - "creative acquisition procedures" it is! And your silver bookmark would be most welcome, though I'll have our head of security discreetly monitor the meeting room... not that we don't trust academics, but we've learned even the most refined guests can get rather passionate about their projects. Why, just last month we had a heated debate about Jane Austen first editions that nearly led to a spilled sherry incident!
[B]: Heavens, sherry near Austen! That calls for immediate intervention with dry biscuits and a well-placed volume of 'Sense and Sensibility' to restore order. Your security team sounds admirably prepared - perhaps they could give our library guards some pointers. Though I must say, the image of scholars debating with such fervor warms my heart almost as much as your evident dedication to literary preservation. Do keep me apprised of your Survivors Club's growing membership - I may have some... creatively acquired candidates in need of sanctuary.
