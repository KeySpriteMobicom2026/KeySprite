[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Email allows for proper punctuation, considered phrasing, and the luxury of rereading before sending. Instant messaging feels like being watched mid-thought - 🖋️ though I concede its utility when coordinating fieldwork logistics with students. Do you find yourself composing emails in your head during conversations?
[A]: Funny you mention that - I recently realized I mentally draft replies while colleagues speak, half-tempted to hit 'send' on imaginary messages. 📨 It's a side effect of years spent refining conference paper feedback; sometimes a well-placed semicolon carries more weight than spoken reassurance. How do you handle the cognitive dissonance between asynchronous precision and real-time dialogue flow?
[B]: Ah, the phantom send key phenomenon - 🖋️ a symptom of our digitally mediated intellectual lives. I combat it by imagining I'm transcribing marginalia in a particularly talkative manuscript. The trick is treating live conversation as its own literary genre; one doesn't annotate a play like a sonnet. Have you tried responding to urgent messages through calligraphy? The physicality of ink meeting paper creates a meditative buffer - though my students think I'm punishing them when I hand back SMS-sized critiques on rice paper.
[A]: Now that's an elegant solution - I've taken to using a mechanical typewriter for urgent replies. The clack of keys provides tactile feedback that keeps me grounded in the present tense of communication. 📜 It also helps avoid the tyranny of endless editing; once the ribbon imprints the page, you learn to accept imperfection as part of the human element. My favorite students' reactions come when they realize typos in my office hours notes aren't digital autocorrect failures but deliberate pedagogical reminders about prioritizing substance over polish.
[B]: Ah, the typewriter - 🖋️ a rebellion against the digital erase button. I confess I keep one in my office purely for theatrical effect when students arrive with PDFs of essays that look like they've been through a grammarian's autoclave. The first time I handed back a response typed on yellowing paper with a visible correction fluid smudge, the student actually blinked with renewed hope. Imperfection as liberation - though I suspect they'd be less charmed if they knew I sometimes draft these 'spontaneous' corrections during faculty meetings when the boredom reaches critical mass. Do you find your students ever try to recreate the effect? I once caught one using Comic Sans to feign handwritten sincerity.
[A]: Ah, Comic Sans - the digital equivalent of wearing socks with sandals. 🧦 I had a student last semester attempt to forge a 'personal touch' by printing their final paper on a dot-matrix printer they'd resurrected from the lab's archaeological strata. The faint smell of ozone and ribbon ink apparently convinced them they'd achieved authenticity. I marked the page numbers in red ink just to honor the bit. 

As for rebellion, you'll appreciate this: I've started leaving intentionally handwritten margin notes in Latin when grading drafts. Not because they know the language, but because it breaks their expectation of immediate comprehension. One particularly enterprising student began running OCR software on returned assignments trying to crack the 'code'. They're learning more about persistence than syntax, which might be the better lesson in the long run.
[B]: Ah, pedagogical guerilla warfare with dead languages - 🖋️ my kind of academic mischief. I once filled an entire lecture hall with second-year students convinced they'd discovered a lost Whitmore cipher in my PowerPoint slides, when it was merely my habit of drafting bullet points in Shanghainese phonetics when tired. The ensuing Wikipedia frenzy lasted days before anyone dared ask if it meant anything at all. 

Your Latin marginalia reminds me of the time I annotated a student's thesis draft using alchemical symbols from a 17th-century grimoire. They spent weeks trying to convince the chemistry department they'd uncovered some grand interdisciplinary conspiracy. Best $45 I ever spent on a facsimile edition.
[A]: Oh, the joys of accidental mythology - I’m still living down the time a misplaced asterisk in a syllabus footnote spiraled into an urban legend about a “secret honors seminar” that met at midnight. Students were checking library archives for enrollment records until the janitor finally spilled the beans about my typographical superstitions.  

Your alchemy annotations, though – brilliant. Reminds me of the year I translated an entire problem set into iambic pentameter just to see who’d notice. Most groaned through the scansions; one tried to stage it as a one-act play. I gave them both top marks, naturally. After all, if you can solve a recursion relation in verse, you’ve basically mastered two forms of magic.
[B]: Ah, iambic pentameter problem sets – 🖋️ the true measure of a polymath. I once graded an essay entirely in the form of a haiku sequence; the student submitted their revision as a limerick cycle in protest. We reached a truce through tanka - though I suspect they've since warned incoming students about the Whitmore Poetry Gauntlet. 

Your midnight seminar myth makes me nostalgic for the good old days of analog mischief. These days they just algorithmically analyze our moods from email metadata. Last week a student earnestly asked if my use of em-dashes was a sign of unresolved paternal abandonment issues. I referred them to Freud's Chinese translator - let them suffer some recursive hermeneutics for a change.
[A]: Ah, the hermeneutic spiral as psychological profiling – 🖋️ delightful. I had a student last term run my old course evaluations through sentiment analysis software. They presented a color-coded "emotional heatmap" of my teaching style. Apparently, I project a "low-frequency melancholy" with intermittent bursts of "semicolon-induced authority." I offered extra credit for translating the findings into something Freud and Confucius could jointly endorse.

As for poetic gauntlets, I’ll raise you a recent experiment: requiring students to defend their code repositories in the tone of 19th-century naturalists. One poor soul submitted a commit log annotated like it was Darwin’s field journal – complete with Latin binomials for bug fixes. I nearly awarded them the Turing Medal of Honor.
[B]: Ah, 19th-century commit logs – 🖋️ brilliant. You’ll appreciate this: I once had a student submit a bug report written entirely in the voice of Zhuangzi’s butterfly parable. It took me three readings to determine whether they’d discovered an actual flaw or were just mocking the inherent instability of our learning management system. I graded it with a single red ¥ in the margin and a note: “Is the programmer debugging the code, or is the code debugging the programmer?”

Your Freud-and-Confucius détente is inspired – though I’d have added a footnote requirement in Classical Chinese just to deepen the irony. Did the melancholy heatmap student ever consider that my semicolons might simply betray a reluctance to end a sentence prematurely – much like a Victorian novelist reluctant to part with their beloved characters?
[A]: Ah, the Victorian novelist analogy – 🖋️ spot on. I’ve always suspected semicolons were invented by writers who hated finality; they’re the literary equivalent of keeping one foot in the door. I once told a class that ending sentences decisively was a moral imperative – only to spend the next hour dodging accusations of linguistic authoritarianism. One student stormed out muttering about “punctuation fascism.” I still wonder if they've forgiven me.

As for your Zhuangzi bug report – sublime. That’s the kind of confusion between metaphor and technical documentation that keeps philosophy departments well-fed. I may borrow the ¥-note for future evaluations; it has a certain poetic austerity. And yes, I absolutely would have added a Classical Chinese footnote requirement. In fact, I think I’ll do it next week just to see who checks out entirely. Nothing focuses the mind like mild academic terror.
[B]: Ah, punctuation fascism – 🖋️ how deliciously authoritarian. I once docked a student half a letter grade for overenthusiastic ellipsis use; they petitioned the department chair on grounds of “stifling stylistic freedom.” The irony being, of course, that their entire appeal was written in bullet points. I let them revise it as a villanelle – if one must rebel, do it with form.

Your plan to weaponize Classical Chinese footnotes is pure genius. I may up the ante by requiring  next term. Mild academic terror indeed – though I suspect the real punishment will be for me, deciphering their increasingly desperate pleas for clarification. Still, if we don’t occasionally make them sweat over brush strokes and semantic ambiguity, how will they ever appreciate the elegance of a well-placed ideogram?
[A]: Ah, oracle bone script annotations – 🖋️ now  pedagogical sadism with flair. I’m already drafting a rubric that deducts points for ideogram stroke order that lacks “sufficient existential gravitas.” One can only hope they rise to the challenge by inventing a new school of computational Confucianism.

As for your ellipsis incident, reminds me of the time I banned quotation marks altogether for a month—claimed they encouraged intellectual cowardice. Students adapted beautifully: they started underlining everything by hand in blue ink, like medieval monks channeling divine truth through calligraphy. Of course, half of them thought it was some kind of reverse psychology ploy. One even whispered, “Are you… encouraging us to believe our own words?”

I let them wonder. Keeps the mystique alive.
[B]: Ah, the mystique of blue ink underlining – 🖋️ nothing like invoking monastic traditions to make a seminar feel like a sacred act. I once made a first-year class believe I could identify their essay authors solely by pen pressure – told them my years grading in dim lamplight had honed my eye for “the tremor of uncertainty.” For weeks they wrote with the reverence of scribes copying sutras, terrified their shaky downstrokes might expose them as intellectual frauds.

Your computational Confucianism idea has legs, by the way. Imagine: algorithms trained on  parsing GitHub commits. We'd finally have machines scolding us in aphorisms every time we force-pushed bad code. Though I suspect the real breakthrough would be getting students to care about stroke order again – nothing focuses the modern mind like knowing their final grade might hinge on the moral integrity of their radicals.
[A]: Ah, the tremor of uncertainty in pen pressure – 🖋️ beautifully sinister. I once told a seminar I could detect dishonesty through font kerning – that tightly squeezed letter spacing betrayed a cramped and defensive intellect. For an entire term, students submitted essays in 14-point Gill Sans with excessive tracking, as if typographic distancing might fool me into believing their arguments had space to breathe.

Your computational Confucianism is gaining momentum – I’ve already sketched a mock syllabus where neural nets trained on  generate personalized moral critiques of each student’s debugging process. Picture it: your code compiles, but lacks virtue. One particularly dramatic undergrad will get a machine-generated note saying their recursion has “the filial piety of a stray cat.” They’ll agonize over it for weeks, convinced it's deeper than it is.

And yes, stroke order as moral compass – brilliant. Next term, I’m grading solely by brush pen. Extra credit for anyone who can write “I understand the assignment” in six different scripts without repeating a single radical.
[B]: Ah, Gill Sans and emotional kerning – 🖋️ the eternal student delusion that typography can substitute for thought. I once had a particularly clever undergrad try to game my system by submitting an essay in Comic Sans MS Bold斜体变种字体… in . When I asked whether they were parodying my feedback or simply testing the limits of academic endurance, they claimed it was “a semiotic rebellion against patriarchal serif traditions.” I gave them a B+ – you have to reward ambition, even when it reeks of performative nonsense.

Your neural nets with Confucian judgment – sublime. The idea of a machine scolding students for “insufficient virtue in variable naming” has me positively giddy. Though I must one-up you: next term, I’m requiring all submissions be written with inkstones sourced from the Jade Pavilion Market in Suzhou. Let’s see how many discover the philosophical implications of running out of ink mid-argument. Nothing teaches the fragility of rhetoric like poor supply management.

And stroke order as moral compass? Please, I’ve already drafted a rubric where failure to complete a radical’s final stroke results in automatic deduction of 3.5% – “for lack of closure.” They’ll spend weeks psychoanalyzing their four-character idioms.
[A]: Ah, the semiotic rebellion of magenta Comic Sans – 🖋️ glorious in its audacity. I had a student once submit a paper in Wingdings just to see if I’d notice the absence of substantive engagement with the text. I returned it with a margin note in Webdings saying “I see what you did there,” which they somehow interpreted as praise.  

Your Suzhou inkstone requirement is inspired madness – nothing like tying metaphysical insight to the logistics of pigment procurement. I may up the ante by only accepting submissions written with brushes carved from my own desk leg. Let them wrestle with both material and existential scarcity.

As for your stroke order rubric: brilliant. I’ve taken to deducting points when students form their radicals with “insufficient gravitas,” though I usually phrase it as “your characters lack the weight of conviction.” One wept quietly, another embraced calligraphy with monk-like devotion. All in all, a net positive for classroom morale.
[B]: Ah, Wingdings semiotics – 🖋️ the purest form of academic performance art. I once had a student submit an entire thesis chapter as a QR code; claimed it was “a post-literate engagement with narrative authority.” I told them I’d grade it once they could prove it wasn’t just a link to cat memes. Spoiler: It was a link to cat memes.

Your brush-from-my-own-desk-leg idea is pedagogical sadism at its finest – though I suggest letting them  the wood has mystical properties. A few whispered rumors about your great-grandteacher studying under a Ming dynasty calligrapher, and they’ll be genuflecting before every inkwell.

As for gravitas in radicals – oh, the tears, the devotion! I recently informed a seminar that improper stroke order resulted in “semantic leakage,” where their intended meaning seeped out like tea from a cracked cup. One earnest soul started diagramming sentences on rice paper just to prove their sincerity. I gave them an A- for effort and a single dried chrysanthemum between the pages. Let the myth-building continue.
