[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question that cuts to the heart of textual materiality. While I appreciate the efficiency of digital notes for cross-referencing rare manuscripts - my students are quite fond of their annotation apps - there's something irreplaceable about the physicality of a handwritten letter. 

The pressure of the nib against paper reveals more than just words; you can almost hear the writer's heartbeat in the ink bleeds. Just last week I was comparing a 1890s correspondence between a Cantonese scholar and his British peer, their dialogue across cultures preserved in both copperplate script and semi-cursive kaishu. The medium itself became part of the message.

Though I must admit, I've started using voice-to-text for lecture notes after spraining my wrist calligraphy practice. Progress demands compromise, doesn't it?
[A]: Oh wow, your perspective is so deep~ 📜 I totally get what you mean about the "texture" of communication. As a show producer, we always chase that raw emotion - sometimes digital just feels too polished, ya know?  

Like last season, we had this confession letter segment where contestants wrote to their families. The director wanted actual paper because tears on screen? 💥 So real! But then again, when we're racing against deadlines, editing notes in Google Docs with all the team members? Efficiency is 🔥

Hmm... Maybe that's the key? Balancing between soul & convenience? 💡 Though honestly, I still secretly wish my ex would send me a hand-written postcard... From Paris 🗼而不是冷冰冰的微信消息😂
[B]: Ah, the eternal tension between auratic presence and pragmatic necessity - Walter Benjamin would have a field day with your industry! Though I suspect even he would pause the lecture to wipe a tear at your confession segment. 

There's a reason my students still gasp when I pass around Emily Dickinson's envelope poems - those fragments scrawled on repurposed paper scream with intimacy. And yet...  Last month I nearly derailed a conference panel because I insisted on quoting from a 1902 diary entry about Shanghai tea houses that I'd transcribed by hand. Turns out OCR would've saved me twenty minutes of butchering the poor woman's copperplate.

Speaking of longing - remind me to show you Qing末 love letters sometime. The poets would encode romantic pleas in carefully folded paper cranes sent through servants. Makes WeChat emojis seem positively barbaric, doesn't it? Though I suppose we all have our modern compromises...
[A]: Oh my god，paper cranes with secret messages?! That’s so cinematic~ 🎬 I need that energy in our next reality show! Can you imagine contestants sending handmade love letters instead of just texting? The drama would be off the charts! 💥

But okay, real talk for a sec – sometimes I feel like we’re losing something sacred in this digital age. Like, how do you archive  on a hard drive? Last week, we filmed this nostalgic episode where people wrote letters to their past selves… You should’ve seen the cast – everyone got so emotional holding those pages! Tears were . 😭✨  

Still though, when it comes to editing chaos behind the scenes? I’d pick cloud storage over ink-stained scripts any day. Efficiency is everything when you're racing against airtime deadlines! ⏳ But hey, bring out those Qing-era love letters soon – I need more inspiration (and maybe a few paper cranes for luck 😉)
[B]: Ah, but therein lies the paradox - we're all archivists of invisible ghosts in this digital age. I recall a particular 1843 case where a Shanghai merchant's wife composed laments on rice paper, each poem folded into a different origami shape to signal her emotional state. Her husband would receive these silent communiqués mid-Atlantic voyage and adjust his trade route accordingly. Imagine that on your show! Contestants interpreting love through paper folds while racing against clock towers... 

Though I confess, even my most romanticized notions bow to practicality when grading fifty essays on Dickensian orphans. Last semester I tried digitizing my late grandmother's diary using a scanner app - turned out her tear stains from the 1920s still showed up more clearly than any student's "I feel" analysis. 

Speaking of production magic - remind me to show you how Qing scholars disguised political dissent in poetic letter preambles. Perfect dramatic device for your next season finale. And yes, I shall bring those letters along to our next tea session - though fair warning, the last researcher who borrowed them got so swept up in a forbidden romance subplot he missed his flight to Chengdu!
[A]: Okay, I’m literally scribbling down notes right now 📝✨ That merchant’s wife story?  It’s got everything – romance, mystery, and origami coded emotions! Can you imagine translating that into a reality show challenge? Like, “Fold this crane to tell your crush you’re dying inside” 😂  

And the tear stains showing up clearer than analysis essays? Queen. Tears > theories any day. 💥 We should do an episode where people send anonymous letters to each other using symbolic origami folds… The drama would be next level. Contestants crying, confessing, folding like it’s the final showdown on Survivor 🏕️🔥  

Also??? A political diss track hidden in poetry preambles?! You’ve got me shook with these historical tea 🫖👀 Please spill more about that Qing scholar stuff – sounds like the perfect twist for our season finale. Betrayals, secret messages, unrequited love… I’m already drafting the promo script in my head 🎥💡  

You’re basically my creative fairy godfather at this point 👑😂
[B]: Oh, the Qing scholars would’ve  your reality show format. Picture this: poets embedding subversive sonnets in what appeared to be innocuous landscape descriptions - a "crane soaring westward" might signal exile, while "ink bleeding through paper" warned of imminent arrest. One 1798 case involved a dissident who encoded Confucian critiques into wedding vows. The groom’s calligraphy master was so busy correcting the bride’s radicals, he missed the treasonous double entendres!

But let me tell you about the  one - a 1825 love triangle disguised as an orchid painting manual. Pages upon pages of seemingly scholarly brushwork techniques concealed instructions for a secret book club meeting where they’d critique imperial policies. When authorities raided the gathering, all they found were inkstones and... ah, the irony... "Improperly folded lotus petals." 

As for your origami challenge idea - I once saw a scholar’s reply letter from 1860 that contained nothing but 36 identical plum blossom folds. Turns out, each represented a censored word from the original missive. Censors never noticed, but the recipient? Oh, she married someone else the very next week. Tragic, really - though not nearly as dramatic as your Survivor analogy. 

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go dig up those letters before my colleague Professor Li gets any more brilliant ideas about “borrowing” them again. Last time he dramatized a mere footnote into a three-act opera.
[A]: Oh my god, this is GOLD 😍 I need to cast that plum blossom guy ASAP – 36 folds of silent rage? That’s not just a love story, that’s PERFORMANCE ART. 🎭 If he showed up on our show folding blossoms while side-eyeing his ex? Ratings would break the internet!  

And those sneaky Qing poets with their “landscape descriptions”? Iconic. Totally stealing that for our next mystery challenge – imagine contestants writing “innocent” letters while hiding secret clues in the brushstrokes 😏 We could even have a calligraphy face-off: who can write the most  love note without getting caught by the “censors” (aka our judges).  

Also, PLEASE tell me more about that orchid manual/book club saga. Sounds like the OG coded podcast network 🎙️🔐 If they had inkstones and “improper petals” as evidence… honestly, it’s giving academia meets espionage. James Bond but with scrolls 😂  

Alright, go rescue those letters before Prof. Li turns another footnote into an opera 😉 But seriously, hurry back – I’ve got a vision board waiting! ✨📜
[B]: Ah, you’d have adored the orchid manual affair - it was positively dripping with dramatic irony. The ringleader, a Mr. Chen Zhaoyang, taught his disciples to embed dissent in seemingly innocuous annotations about petal curvature. “Note the irregular calyx symmetry when grown east of the magistrate’s garden” actually meant “the district tax records are falsified.” They even developed a ranking system - one coiled leaf = mild criticism, three spirals = open revolt.

But here’s the delicious twist: when censors raided their so-called “botanical study group,” they  find genuine pressed orchids… along with a scroll of what appeared to be wedding invitations. The calligraphy contained deliberate misshapes - a missing horizontal stroke in 寡 meant “widowed by corruption,” while an extra dot in 法 (“law”) warned of judicial bribery. Chen escaped conviction by claiming he’d simply been practicing clerical script variations for his daughter’s marriage banquet.

And let’s not forget the plum blossom master’s tragic encore - after his 36 silent folds were ignored, he carved his final plea into melon rinds sent to the woman’s household. The servants ate the evidence before realizing each spiral held a poem. , I ask you! If that doesn’t scream reality show gold, I’ll eat my entire collection of Qing-era inkstones.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I hear Professor Li humming revolutionary opera tunes down the corridor. Time to enact emergency letter retrieval protocol...
[A]: Oh my god, that plum blossom guy carving poems into MELONS?! 🍉😭 This is too good. I’m literally rewriting the entire season plot right now – we’re talking . Imagine a contestant trying to confess their love through watermelon carvings… and the delivery guy eats the evidence. That’s not just drama, that’s a FOOD CRIME 😂  

And Chen Zhaoyang? Total legend. If he were on our show, I’d make him team lead in a heartbeat – teach the others how to code rebellion into flower petals while smiling sweetly at the cameras 😌💐 We could even do a challenge where they write “innocent” letters but hide clues in the brushstroke pressure – like emotional forensics! 🔍🖋️  

Also, can we talk about the fact that  is now my new favorite phrase?? That’s poetic justice in the most literal way possible 😂✨ I need that energy in our finale. Please, please, PLEASE bring those scrolls soon – I’ve already started drafting melon-shaped confession cards for the cast 🍉✍️💡  

Go save those letters!! And hurry back – I think I just found our season’s tagline:  🎬📜🔥
[B]: Ah, but you’ve hit upon the very essence of 19th-century textual rebellion - what better way to hide dissent than in the edible ephemeral? Chen would’ve adored your melon motif; indeed, he once embedded coordinates to a secret meeting in the curvature of a carved winter melon served at a magistrate’s banquet. Unfortunately for him, the host was fond of pickling slices... though fortunately for us, pickling brine tends to preserve ink rather beautifully. The poem survived, pickled alongside the evidence.

As for brushstroke pressure as emotional forensics -  truly. One of my favorite cases involved a lovelorn scribe from Suzhou who varied his pressure so dramatically that his final plea left permanent impressions on the paper beneath - those indentations later exonerated him when authorities accused his beloved of forgery. She simply flipped the page and said, “Arrest the man who wrote through his heartbreak.”

And dare I tell you about the case of the invisible ink rebellion? A Guangzhou scholar used plum juice to draft a manifesto against opium trade - the text only appeared when exposed to candlelight. Tragically, one recipient mistook it for actual plum paste and... well, let’s just say digestive distress made for a very dramatic footnote.

I shall retrieve those scrolls with all due haste - Professor Li seems to have barricaded himself in the archives singing something suspiciously like  One moment while I negotiate with opera-armed academia...
[A]: Oh my god, pickled poetry?! 🍉📜 That’s not just preservation, that’s . Chen was literally seasoning his rebellion – “Here’s a little dissent with your dinner, magistrate” 😂 And the guy who carved coordinates into melon curves? Total genius. I’m picturing contestants slicing honeydew for secret messages next episode… until someone mistakes it for snack time and we lose another plot twist to digestion 😭  

And that lovelorn scribe leaving heartbreak indentations?! Soul. In. Paper. We  that in our finale – maybe a blindfolded handwriting analysis challenge where they write love letters so intense the paper actually tears from emotional pressure 😂💥  

But wait —  Okay, this is too good. Contestants writing secret confessions on banana leaves using lemon juice? Then holding them over candles like mini detectives 🔥🍋 And someone accidentally licks the page?? Oh my god, I can already see the blooper reel 😂  

Alright, go storm the archive castle before Li turns Qing history into a Frozen fanfic 🎤🔐 Hurry back though – I’ve got a full storyboard now and zero self-control. We're talking edible secrets, candlelit drama, and possibly a contestant licking paper for clues. This season is gonna break the internet AND the Ming Dynasty 🌟🧨
[B]: Ah, but let us toast to the glorious messiness of plum-juice politics - quite literally, in that case. One censor actually  taste the manifesto, declared it "sourer than bureaucratic reform," and promptly dropped the treason investigation. Turns out imperial officials had very refined palates but terrible irony detection.

And speaking of emotional pressure - remind me to show you a 1904 letter where a frustrated scholar pressed so hard his brush tore through three sheets, leaving what I call "the original angry tweet." When his beloved received the shredded plea, she reportedly said only, “He writes like he loves - too forcefully,” and married a tea merchant who used feather-light strokes.

As for your candlelit lemon juice challenge... allow me to drop one more historical breadcrumb before I go fully rogue librarian on Professor Li’s barricade. There was this darling scandal in 1876 when a young woman disguised her poetry as medical prescriptions using citrus ink. Her father, a physician, spent weeks prescribing nonsense remedies to confused patients before realizing his own daughter had been writing love sonnets on the prescription scrolls. 

Now then - brace yourself for opera-level theatrics. I’m storming the archive with a thermos of jasmine tea and my most intimidating Qing-era seal stone. If I don’t return within the hour, assume I’ve been turned into a footnote... or worse, recruited for Professor Li’s Ming Dynasty musical.
[A]: Oh my god, that scholar pressing so hard he  with feels?? Iconic. 💥 I need that in our season premiere – maybe a challenge where they write love letters on rice paper while blindfolded. The one who punches through gets crowned “Most Emotionally Explosive” and immunity 😂💥  

And the citrus ink disguised as medical scripts?! Queen of stealth romance. If she were on our show, she’d be writing diagnoses like “Patient presents with severe heart palpitations… prescribe 3am poetry sessions” 📝🍋❤️ And the dad prescribing nonsense remedies? Comedy gold. We should recreate that – cast members diagnosing each other’s feelings through fake herbal prescriptions. “Ah yes, your symptoms include excessive sighing and too many emojis” 😂  

Also, you’re out here storming archives with jasmine tea and a seal stone??? You're not just rescuing letters, you're writing an entire historical drama arc right now 👑📜 Please film this showdown for future episodes – “When Academia Goes Rogue: Behind the Scrolls.”  

Hurry back though! I’ve got melon carving, citrus confessionals, and at least three contestants ready to tear paper with their FEELS. This is gonna be legendary 🔥🍉🖋️✨
[B]: Ah, but let’s not forget the glorious aftermath of that rice-paper-shredding scholar - his beloved  keep the fragments pressed in her poetry album, you see. Said it reminded her “of autumn leaves breaking underfoot when walking alone after heartbreak.” I propose a challenge where contestants must convey entire emotional arcs through pressure variation alone. Winner gets to preserve their “masterpiece” in my personal collection - though I’ll warn you, last year a student tried this and ended up needing acupuncture for writer’s cramp.

As for your citrus ink medical farce - perfection! The Qing censor-physicians actually developed a diagnostic shorthand: one horizontal stroke meant “bored with marriage,” three dots beside a character warned “surveillance nearby.” Imagine contestants scribbling prescriptions that read “Patient exhibits excessive moon-gazing… prescribe avoidance of plum blossoms and extra calligraphy practice.”

Now then - Professor Li has escalated. He's now barricaded behind a replica of the Forbidden City's western gate, singing  at full volume while dramatically waving our Qing letters above his head. Negotiations are... delicate. I’ve offered him access to my 19th-century British satire collection in exchange for safe passage, but he’s holding out for something . Something... operatic.

One moment while I pull rank on this archival opera siege. If I don’t return within twenty minutes, assume I’ve been drafted into an impromptu duet about forbidden inkstones.
[A]: Oh my god, I need that acupuncture-for-writer’s-crap detail in our BTS blooper reel 😂✨ And the idea of contestants diagnosing “excessive moon-gazing”?? That’s not just drama, that’s . We’re talking full-blown character arcs written in lemon juice and heartbreak pressure points 🍋🖋️💔  

Also??? Li’s barricade just upgraded from Forbidden City gate to full Wicked-style  theatrics?! 🎭🔥 This isn’t an archive battle anymore – it’s a . If he starts belting  while waving Qing letters like a cape, I’m officially casting him as the show’s villain next season.  

But okay, real talk – if you  get drafted into a duet about forbidden inkstones... just know we’ll be streaming it live on the show’s WeChat later. "When Professors Go Rogue: The Musical" – coming soon to a binge session near you 😉📜🎤  

Go get those scrolls, Lin-Manuel! 🎬💪
[B]: Ah, but you see, the true tragedy lies not in the acupuncture mishap or even Li’s operatic insurrection - no, the real drama is in the inkstone itself. Forbidden, you say?  You haven’t heard the half of it.

Last week I discovered Professor Li had been secretly carving his own counter-narratives into the margins of those Qing letters - little rebellious footnotes penned in invisible ink! A scholar’s duel across centuries, waged with citrus juice and spite. He claims he was “adding dramatic tension” to otherwise “stale historical correspondence.” The audacity!

And speaking of tension - remind me to show you a 1897 love letter where the writer  included acupuncture diagrams as metaphor. Each needle point corresponded to a secret meeting location. Tragically romantic... or tragically ill-advised? The recipient showed up at the wrong meridian and well... let’s just say their story didn’t end with tea and sonnets.

Now then - off I go, full  energy, to reclaim our scrolls from this musical siege. If I must duet with Li about inkstones, I shall demand full creative control and a chorus of graduate students in supporting roles.

Wish me luck, my melodramatic co-conspirator. Or better yet - wish Li a dramatic key change mid-aria. That tends to make him drop whatever he's holding.
[A]: Oh my god – SECRET FOOTNOTES INVISIBLE INK WARS?! 📜🍋🔥 This is better than any season finale I’ve ever plotted. Li’s not just a professor, he’s the  – charming, rebellious, and writing fanfiction in the margins of history! We need to air this showdown live with popcorn sponsorship 💥🎥  

And acupuncture meridian love maps gone wrong?? Iconic tragedy or the greatest dating app disaster of the 19th century? Either way, we’re turning that into a challenge – contestants have to write love letters with hidden coordinates… but if they mess up the directions, they end up confessing to the wrong person 😂💔🧭  

Also, you going full  on an archive barricade while demanding grad student backup singers?? I’m already designing your costume: Qing dynasty robes with a mic pack and dramatic side-eye 🔥🎤👑  

Good luck out there, my melodramatic mastermind. And if all else fails… throw in a key change and snatch those scrolls mid-aria 🎶📜✨
[B]: Ah, but here’s the twist - Li wasn’t merely writing footnotes. No, no, no. He’d  one of the Qing correspondents! Claimed he was “channeling the spirit of a lovelorn calligrapher” and had started signing his marginalia with a 19th-century seal he carved himself. When I confronted him, he looked me dead in the eye and said, “Darling, historiography is just fanfiction with better citations.”

And that acupuncture map tragedy? Oh, it gets worse. The misdirected lover didn’t just show up at the wrong meridian - she appeared at a . Picture it: romantic confession clutched in one hand, severed head on a pike on the other. She still tried to deliver her letter, for heaven’s sake! The guard thought it was a death poem and included it in the official record. It now holds the dubious honor of being the shortest surviving Qing-era love letter: 

As for my entrance strategy - think less Hamiltonian duel, more . I’ve instructed my most dramatic graduate students to begin humming the  habanera as they casually stroll past Li’s barricade. Nothing unsettles an operatic villain like second-year PhD candidates with pitch pipes.

Now then - if you’ll excuse me, I must go reclaim our scrolls before Li decides to rewrite the entire 19th century as a tragic bromance between two rival inkstones. Should I fail... well, at least we have enough material for  seasons of melodrama.
