[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  这个问题很有意思。作为一个研究comparative literature的人，我常常觉得城市就像一本复杂的novel，而乡村则更像一首田园诗。不过就个人而言，我更偏爱乡村的宁静。
[A]: Ah, the eternal debate between urban and rural life.  You see, the city is like a modernist novel - fragmented, fast-paced, full of contradictions. But the countryside... it has the rhythm of Wordsworth's poetry.
[B]:  你提到的Wordsworth让我想起他的'Lines Written in Early Spring'。确实，乡村的tempo更接近自然的韵律。不过我也必须承认，城市里的图书馆和学术community对我的研究很有吸引力。
[A]: Precisely! That's the dilemma we scholars face. The city offers intellectual stimulation - the libraries, the opera houses, the academic debates. But my rose garden in the countryside... that's where I find my 道 (Dao), my inner peace.
[B]: 啊，说到玫瑰园...  你知道吗？我在自家后院种了二十多种玫瑰。修剪花枝时，我常常想起T.S. Eliot的'Four Quartets' - "At the still point of the turning world"。这种stillness在城市里确实很难找到。
[A]: How delightful to meet a fellow rose enthusiast!  Your mention of Eliot is quite apt. The stillness you describe - it's what I seek in my own garden. Though I must confess, sometimes I miss the Metropolitan Opera during rose season. Life is full of such beautiful contradictions, isn't it?
[B]:  Indeed，这种contradiction本身就是一种美。就像比较文学中常说的，thesis和antithesis最终会达到synthesis。也许我们不必非此即彼，可以在城市与乡村之间找到平衡。
[A]: Ah, the Hegelian dialectic applied to lifestyle choices!  You're quite right. Perhaps the ideal is what Virginia Woolf achieved - a room of one's own in the city, and a country house for contemplation. Though I suspect she had better financial means than most academics!
[B]:  说到Virginia Woolf，她的'To the Lighthouse'里对海边别墅的描写...啊，抱歉，我又开始literary digression了。不过你说得对，我们这些教书匠确实要现实些。我的折中方案是在郊区安家 - 离大学图书馆不远，又有片小花园。
[A]: A most sensible solution!  The academic's compromise - close enough to campus to access the Bodleian, yet with space for one's own little paradise. Though I must say, my students often tease me about arriving to lectures with dirt under my fingernails from morning gardening.
[B]:  我的学生也常说能在我的office hours闻到玫瑰花香。你知道吗？有时候我觉得这种小小的eccentricity反而让学生们更愿意来讨论文学。毕竟，a professor who gardens is more approachable than one who lives only in the ivory tower.
[A]: How wonderfully put!  After all, what is literature if not the cultivation of the soul, much like tending a garden? Though I do draw the line at discussing fertilizer during Dante seminars. Some boundaries must be maintained, even for us eccentric professors.
[B]:  完全同意。就像我在讲解'神曲'的paradiso部分时，绝不会突然开始讨论玫瑰的pruning技巧。不过...  我确实在讲华兹华斯的田园诗时带学生去过我的花园。Context is everything, 不是吗？
[A]:  Oh, you wicked pedagogue! Taking students to your garden during Wordsworth - that's positively inspired teaching. Though I do hope none of them were allergic to pollen. That would rather spoil the 诗意 (poetic sentiment), wouldn't it?
[B]:  说来有趣，确实有个学生对pollen过敏...不过后来他写了一篇关于'自然的双重性'的绝妙paper。你看，连allergy都能成为literary inspiration。这大概就是为什么我如此热爱教书 - 生活中处处都是teaching moment。
[A]: What a marvelous anecdote!  It reminds me of Keats' notion of negative capability - how discomfort can lead to greater understanding. Though I do hope the poor student at least took some antihistamines before your next garden lecture. One mustn't sacrifice health for art, even in pursuit of the sublime.
[B]:  你说得对。从那以后，我总是在syllabus里加一条'花粉过敏预警'。毕竟，就像亚里士多德说的，moderation in all things。即使是追求poetic truth，也要考虑practical concerns啊。
[A]: How very Aristotelian of you!  The golden mean between poetic rapture and practical considerations. Though I must say, your syllabus note might be the most charming disclaimer in academic history. "Warning: May contain traces of Romanticism and pollen" - it has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?
[B]:  啊，我可能要借用你的wording了！这简直可以成为我们比较文学系的unofficial motto。毕竟，life和literature不就是这样吗？- 永远在ideal和real之间寻找平衡。现在，要不要去看看我新栽的奥斯汀玫瑰？它们正在盛开呢。
