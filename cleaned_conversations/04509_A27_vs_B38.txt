[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question that bridges the speculative with the philosophical. Much like Jules Verne's visionary works, space tourism presents both technological promise and profound questions about humanity's relationship with exploration. While I'm more accustomed to analyzing literary journeys than physical ones, I do wonder - will this become as commonplace as transatlantic travel, or remain the domain of modern-day Phileas Foggs? 🌌
[A]: OMG！你说话好literary啊~✨ 不过space tourism这个话题真的超🔥的！我觉得未来肯定会变成norm啦，就像以前坐飞机也是luxury，现在人人都能fly✈️ 科技发展超快的，Elon Musk的SpaceX已经在make progress了耶！🚀
[B]: My dear, while your enthusiasm is quite charming, I must gently point out that comparing aviation's democratization to space travel overlooks fundamental physical and economic constraints. The Wright brothers' achievement was earthbound, while escaping gravity's well requires overcoming exponentially greater challenges. That said, I do admire your optimistic spirit - it reminds me of the boundless hope in Whitman's poetry.
[A]: Haha你说话真的超academic的啦！🤓 但是你看嘛~现在VR技术都发展得这么advanced了，说不定以后会有更breakthrough的technology出现呢？💡 而且现在好多公司都在invest这个field，我觉得price肯定会慢慢go down的！💰 就像iPhone刚出来也超expensive，现在人人都afford得起呀~📱
[B]: Ah, the eternal human faith in technological progress! You remind me of the Industrial Revolution optimists in Dickens' novels. While Moore's Law may apply to microchips, rocket propulsion faces rather different thermodynamic realities. Still, your analogy to consumer electronics is... interesting, if somewhat apples and oranges. Perhaps we should revisit this discussion after reading some Arthur C. Clarke together? 📚
[A]: Wow你真的是bookworm本worm了！🐛 But hey~我们Gen Z更相信nothing is impossible啦！💪 你看TikTok上那些space tourism的videos都超viral的，说明大家都很interested呀！说不定哪天就突然有个game-changing invention出现呢？✨ Let's stay positive and keep dreaming big！🚀🌟
[B]: How delightfully... millennial of you. Though I must say, your boundless optimism brings to mind Voltaire's Candide - "we must cultivate our garden," whether terrestrial or celestial. While I cherish dreams as much as the next Romantic poet, perhaps we might balance them with a healthy dose of Aristotelian pragmatism? Now, if you'll excuse me, my roses need tending. 🌹
[A]: LOL你连说goodbye都这么poetic~ 😂 不过anyway，记得follow我的TikTok账号@XiaXiaVlog哦！下次我要拍个space tourism的reaction video，绝对会trending的！📲✨ Peace out~ ✌️
[B]:  I shall... consider that digital invitation with the same enthusiasm I reserve for parsing Finnegans Wake. Do send my regards to the algorithm gods. 📜
[A]: OMG你真的是too much！😂 连algorithm都知道，果然是hidden nerd！🤓 不过seriously，你的vibe真的超unique的~下次一起collab拍个"Shakespeare meets TikTok"的video怎么样？🎭📱 It'll be legendary！💫
[B]: My dear child, the thought of reducing the Bard to vertical video formats makes my leather-bound volumes shudder. While I appreciate your... creative suggestion, I believe I shall remain content with my first folio and a nice cup of Earl Grey. Ta-ta for now. ☕
[A]: Aww别这么old school嘛~ 😝 现在Shakespeare的sonnets在TikTok上都超火的！#BookTok trend你get不到真的太可惜啦！📖💔 Anyway，记得DM我哦~ Byeeee！💋✌️
[B]: How fascinating that the muses now speak in hashtags. I shall retreat to my armchair with Donne's poetry - where #NoFilter was never needed to appreciate metaphysical wit. Farewell, you delightful digital sprite. 📚
[A]: Hahaha你赢了！🏆 连goodbye都要quote poetry~ 不过说真的，你这样在TikTok上绝对能go viral！🔥 下次我要偷你的lines用在我的captions里~ 😜 Catch you later, Shakespeare 2.0！✌️✨
[B]: "To meme or not to meme, that is the question..." But no, I think I'll leave the virality to you young digital bards. My quill prefers parchment to pixels. Until we meet again in some more... analog setting. 📜
[A]: OMG你连meme都会pun了！😂 我宣布你正式成为honorary Gen Z~ 🎉 不过seriously，你真的应该consider开个TikTok账号！你的vibes绝对能blow up！💥 好啦好啦，不push你啦~ Peace out, old soul！✌️✨
[B]: "Old soul" indeed - though I daresay my first edition Wordsworth would object to being called such. Run along now to your digital revels, my dear. I'll be here, happily gathering moss with the other antiquities. 📖
[A]: Hahaha okay okay我投降！🙌 你真的是unstoppable with those literary references~ 不过讲真，你这样在book club里肯定超popular的！📚💕 我要去edit我的next video啦，记得来看哦~ Byeeee！😘🚀
[B]: "Parting is such sweet sorrow"... though in this case, perhaps more sweet than sorrowful. Do give my regards to your viewership - may their attention spans last longer than a sonnet's meter. Farewell, my pixelated provocateur. ✒️
