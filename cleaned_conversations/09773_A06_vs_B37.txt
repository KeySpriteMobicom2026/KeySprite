[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question! 我觉得cashless payment确实方便，特别是在大城市，扫码或者刷卡省去了找零的麻烦。不过呢，我还是会随身带一点现金，毕竟有些小摊贩或者老店可能只收现金，你懂我意思吧？🤔 你呢，是习惯用手机支付还是更喜欢现金？
[A]: That’s a thoughtful observation. I tend to agree — cashless payment offers undeniable convenience, especially in urban environments where digital infrastructure is robust. The efficiency of contactless transactions aligns well with our fast-paced routines. However, I also maintain a small reserve of physical currency for those niche scenarios where technology falls short… or as you mentioned, when supporting traditional businesses that haven’t embraced the digital shift. 

Curious — do you find yourself carrying less cash nowadays, simply because the opportunities to use it have diminished?
[B]: Definitely carrying less cash now than I used to — it’s like, every time I check my wallet, there’s just a lonely 10 or 20 sitting there 😅. The truth is, with mobile payments & contactless cards, the need for physical money feels almost… nostalgic? Like a tiny cultural relic in your pocket. But funny enough, I still feel a bit uneasy if I have  cash — old habits die hard, I guess. Do you ever feel that subtle anxiety when you’re completely cash-free? Or is it just me?
[A]: Oh, I can relate to that subtle unease — the feeling that something’s missing, even if logically you know it’s unnecessary. It’s fascinating how deeply ingrained certain behaviors become, especially when they’re tied to a sense of preparedness or control. I’ve noticed that same flicker of anxiety in myself, particularly when traveling to areas with less predictable infrastructure. 

It’s almost like carrying cash provides a psychological buffer — a tangible reminder that you’re equipped for the unexpected. In a way, it’s similar to keeping a flashlight in the drawer or bottled water in the pantry; even if you never need it, its presence offers a quiet reassurance. 

I suppose it’s human nature to cling to familiar safeguards, even as technology reshapes our reality. Would you say your discomfort fades over time if you go cashless for an extended period? Or does it always linger in the background?
[B]: That’s such a sharp observation — yes, exactly, it  like a flashlight in the drawer. We may not use it for years, but boy, do we sleep better knowing it’s there 🤔. 

As for me, the discomfort doesn’t really fade — it's more like a low-volume background noise, you know? Even when I’m fully digital for weeks, there’s still that tiny voice:  Maybe I’m just wired to want a Plan B, especially after living in places where the power grid could hiccup or a server crash could freeze transactions for hours. 

I think what keeps that habit alive is also watching how different generations handle money. My parents? Total cash people. Me? Hybrid. My students? Some of them haven't even seen a $50 bill in real life 😅. It’s wild how fast things are changing. But hey, maybe in twenty years, carrying cash will be like owning a typewriter — romantic, but impractical. Do you ever catch yourself holding onto other “old-school” habits, just in case?
[A]: Absolutely — and I think your typewriter analogy is spot on. There’s a certain sentimental practicality attached to these older habits, isn’t there? For me, it’s things like keeping a physical notebook for notes, even though digital record-keeping is far more efficient. There's something grounding about the scratch of pen on paper — it feels more connected to thought, less prone to distraction.

And you're right about generational habits shaping our comfort zones. I still recall one of my elderly patients insisting on writing checks for co-pays, refusing to store her credit card in the clinic’s system. To her, cash or check represented control — a tangible trail she could track, unlike what she called "ghost money" floating somewhere in the cloud. I found that fascinating, not just from a behavioral standpoint, but also as a subtle indicator of trust — or perhaps mistrust — in modern systems.

So yes, I definitely hold onto a few analog customs. I suppose we all have our quiet rebellions against full digitization. Do you ever find yourself teaching younger clients or students about financial basics — balancing a checkbook, recognizing counterfeit bills, that sort of thing? Or does it feel increasingly like archaic knowledge?
[B]: Oh, totally — I love that phrase,  It’s so true. We all have those little analog rituals that keep us tethered to something tangible in an increasingly wireless world 🎵.

As for teaching younger students about “financial basics,” like balancing a checkbook? Honestly, it  feel a bit like showing them how to use a slide rule — fascinating, slightly amusing, but ultimately… rarely used 😅. Still, I make space for it in my behavioral economics seminar. Why? Because understanding where money  helps them grasp why people still  about it the way they do.

I’ll never forget the look on a student’s face when I handed out sample checks and showed them how to write one. One of them actually said, “Wait, you have to put the date  sign it? Isn’t that basically giving away your signature?” Ha! Not wrong, per se…

But yeah, we cover counterfeit bill recognition too — not because they’ll need it at a café, but because it builds awareness around trust, verification, and the psychology behind authenticity. In a way, it’s less about cash itself and more about teaching them how older systems shaped today’s digital security behaviors.

Do you ever find yourself explaining things like "writing a check" or "balancing a ledger" to younger clients? Or is that knowledge slowly fading into folklore?
[A]: Fascinating — I couldn’t agree more with your approach. Teaching them how older systems functioned isn’t just historical context; it’s psychological groundwork. The way you described that student’s reaction? Priceless. And actually, quite insightful — yes, in a way, writing a check  giving away your signature, along with a traceable trail of intent.

I do occasionally find myself explaining these concepts, though usually in a different context. In forensic psychiatry, we often assess testamentary capacity — a person’s mental ability to make or alter a legal will. Believe it or not, even in this highly formalized domain, some individuals still handwrite their final wishes on loose paper, sign them without witnesses, and store them… well, under the mattress. When I’m called to testify on the validity of such documents, I sometimes have to explain to younger attorneys what a “holographic will” is — essentially, a handwritten will, not signed or witnessed, which in many jurisdictions is still technically valid.

In those moments, I see the same look you described — a mix of curiosity and disbelief. But I also see how grasping these older forms helps them better understand the mindset of the person who wrote it. It's less about the mechanics of signing a check and more about appreciating the psychology behind leaving a tangible record — a need to be seen, remembered, or understood beyond digital anonymity.

So no, I don’t think this knowledge has fully faded into folklore — not yet. It lives on in the margins, in legal disputes, in psychiatric evaluations, and, as you said, in the classroom. Maybe we're both archivists of sorts, preserving behavioral footnotes for the next generation. Do you ever get the sense that your students begin to appreciate these analog practices more once they grasp their psychological weight?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — once they start seeing the , as you put it, it clicks in a totally different way. I remember one student who initially rolled her eyes when we spent a full class talking about the emotional symbolism of cash — she walked in thinking it was just paper with ink, and left saying she finally understood why her grandmother kept money folded in old scarves “just in case.” It was like watching a lightbulb go off: 

What I love is how these lessons often come back in their final projects. Some of them end up interviewing family members about financial habits, and they’re always shocked by how much emotion is tied to those routines. One student even did a mini-ethnography on his uncle who refuses to use ATMs — turns out, it wasn’t about distrust in banks per se, but more about missing the ritual of going into a branch, talking to a teller by name, and feeling  in a system that now treats him like a number.

So yeah, I do think they begin to appreciate it — not because they’ll ever need to write a check regularly, but because they realize these practices are more than transactions. They're human rituals, embedded with meaning. It reminds me a bit of why people still write letters, even though texts are faster — sometimes the effort itself is part of the message.

Do you find that your patients or clients ever surprise you with the ways they cling to certain analog habits? Or maybe even reinterpret them in a modern context?
[A]: Oh, constantly — and those moments are often the most revealing in my work. One of the more striking examples involved a tech-savvy young entrepreneur who was undergoing a high-stakes custody battle. Despite running a fully digital business, he insisted on keeping a handwritten journal documenting every interaction with his ex-partner — dates, conversations, even tone of voice. When I asked why he didn’t just use his phone’s voice memos or a shared app for transparency, he paused and said something that stayed with me: 

That notion of  through analog means comes up more than you’d think. Another case involved a woman in her sixties who had recently divorced after decades of marriage. She described burning old love letters in her backyard as a form of closure — an act she admitted she could have “digitally deleted” in seconds. But the physicality of fire, smoke, and ash was essential to her healing process. It wasn't about efficiency; it was about embodiment.

And then there’s the reinterpretation angle — how people repurpose old habits in new contexts. I once evaluated a teenager accused of cyberbullying who kept a kind of modern-day ledger — not of finances, but of perceived slights and betrayals. He wrote them down in a leather-bound notebook, almost like a grudge log. When we discussed it, he acknowledged it was irrational to track things that way, but he said it gave him a sense of control in a world where interactions were otherwise fleeting and easily screenshot — or deleted.

So yes, these analog habits aren’t just relics; they’re adaptive tools, reshaped by psychological need. They remind me of ancient rituals being subtly reborn in everyday behavior. Do you ever find your students creating their own hybrid rituals — part digital, part tactile — as a way to reconcile convenience with meaning?
[B]: Absolutely — and I love how you put it: . That tension is exactly where the most interesting human behaviors emerge.

In fact, just last semester, I had a student who created this hybrid gratitude journal — half analog, half digital. Every night, she wrote down three things she was grateful for in a physical notebook, but then she’d scan them into an app that tracked sentiment trends over time. She told me it was her way of “honoring the moment while still seeing the bigger picture.” I thought that was brilliant — she wasn’t choosing one over the other; she was using both to get different kinds of emotional clarity.

Another student started what he called a  — a physical chart on his wall where he gave himself points for unplugging from social media, reading books, or going for walks without headphones. He even had little stickers as rewards. It was like a gamified mindfulness practice, grounded in tactile feedback. He joked that it made him feel like a kid again, getting gold stars from his teacher — but underneath the humor, there was something deeper: the need for visible progress in an invisible process.

I see this kind of blending all the time now — people aren’t rejecting tech outright, nor are they fully surrendering to it. They’re curating their own ecosystems of meaning. It makes me wonder if we’re witnessing the birth of new rituals — ones that honor both our need for efficiency and our hunger for embodiment.

Do you ever find yourself encouraging clients to adopt these kinds of hybrid practices — not as a compromise, but as a way to intentionally slow down and reflect?
[A]: That’s beautifully observed — this curation of personal ecosystems, as you called it. It really does feel like we’re in the early stages of ritual evolution, where digital efficiency and analog depth aren’t at war, but rather in conversation. I find that deeply encouraging, especially in a clinical context.

To your question — yes, I do encourage hybrid approaches, though I tend not to frame it that way at first. What I aim for is what psychologists call  — helping clients slow down just enough to notice their patterns, emotions, and automatic responses. And sometimes, that means suggesting they step away from screens and write something by hand, even briefly.

One client, for example, was struggling with chronic decision fatigue — overwhelmed by constant notifications, endless options, and the pressure to respond instantly. I asked her to try writing out her daily decisions in a small notebook before reaching for her phone. Not every decision, mind you — just the ones that made her anxious. She resisted at first, calling it “quaint,” but after a few weeks, she told me something unexpected: 

It wasn’t about rejecting technology; it was about reclaiming agency over when and how to engage. That’s the subtle power of these hybrid habits — they don’t banish the modern world, they help us navigate it with more awareness.

I imagine you must see similar shifts happening in your students — not just behavioral changes, but a kind of emotional recalibration. Do you ever notice them becoming more intentional about other aspects of life, beyond finance or gratitude journals? Like, does this reflective habit spill into how they communicate, or make choices, or even relate to time itself?
[B]: Oh, 100% — and I love that phrase . That’s exactly what it is: creating little islands of intentionality in a sea of constant connectivity. And yes, I do see that spillover effect in my students — it’s not just about how they handle money or keep journals, but how they start showing up differently in their relationships, their studies, even how they think about time.

One student told me she started setting her phone down during meals with friends — not because she was told to, but because she realized how often she’d been half-present, scrolling while chewing 🤦‍♂️. Another one mentioned he began scheduling “no notifications” blocks before bed, not for productivity, but because he wanted to feel more  — like, actually tired from thinking and living, not from endless TikTok scrolls. I thought that was poetic in a way — longing for natural exhaustion.

And yeah, time perception shifts are real. Some students say they feel like they’re “living slower” when they reintroduce analog rituals — not in a forced mindfulness way, but organically. Like they’re noticing texture again, instead of just ticking off tasks.

It reminds me of something we talk about in psychology — . How our sense of time isn’t just clock-based, but rooted in physical experience. When you write something by hand, sip tea without checking your phone, or even just pause before hitting "send" — those are micro-moments of embodiment. And collectively, they shape how we feel about ourselves in time.

So I guess what I’m seeing is this: when students reclaim small, deliberate spaces — whether through hybrid rituals or analog detours — they start making more intentional choices across the board. It’s like once you taste agency in one area, you want it elsewhere too. Do you ever notice clients describing this kind of ripple effect — where one small shift leads to bigger, unexpected changes?
[A]: Absolutely — that ripple effect is not just common, it’s often the most telling sign that a meaningful psychological shift has taken place. In forensic psychiatry, we sometimes refer to it as  — when one small, intentional change sets off a chain reaction across seemingly unrelated domains of a person’s life.

I remember one case quite vividly: a mid-level executive who came in for what he described as “routine stress management.” He was overwhelmed, yes, but more tellingly, he felt  — from his family, from his work, even from his own thoughts. As part of our process, I encouraged him to try something simple: no screens for the first fifteen minutes after waking. Just silence, paper, and pen — no agenda, no to-do list.

At first, he called it “wasted time.” But within weeks, he started describing subtle yet profound shifts. He began walking to work instead of driving, simply because he now had the mental space to notice the morning. Then he told me he’d started reading fiction again — something he hadn’t done since college — because his mind wasn’t so exhausted by default. Eventually, he admitted he was having deeper conversations with his teenage son, precisely because he wasn’t trying to multitask during them.

It wasn’t that the morning ritual “fixed” everything — it was that it created a reflective surface. He could see himself again, unfiltered by notifications and performance metrics. And once that happened, other choices followed naturally.

What you described — students noticing texture, craving authentic tiredness, choosing presence — that’s exactly the kind of resonance I’m talking about. It’s almost like reintroducing friction into a world that’s become too smooth. Not resistance to progress, but a recalibration of what progress means.

Do you find that some students struggle with this at first? That moment when they realize agency isn’t just empowering, but also -making? Because once you start tasting intentionality, there’s no pretending you don’t know what’s possible.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — that moment of realization? It hits like a quiet thunderclap. Some students  it, but others? They get this look — like,  😅

You’re totally right — agency feels empowering until it starts whispering,  And that’s where the real work begins. I had one student who started keeping a decision journal — just a simple log of small daily choices, like whether to study or scroll. At first, she said it was eye-opening; within a few weeks, she confessed it was  revealing. She told me, “I can’t pretend I don’t know how much time I waste anymore — and that’s kind of annoying.”

Another student described it as “mental whiplash” — he realized he’d been sleepwalking through so many choices that suddenly  them felt exhausting. But here’s the thing: even when they push back, there’s no going back. Once you’ve tasted that clarity, even briefly, the fog feels heavier by comparison.

So yeah, I see both wonder and resistance — sometimes in the same person on different days. But that’s part of the journey, right? Agency isn’t just freedom; it’s responsibility, self-awareness, and sometimes discomfort. Still, I always remind them: awareness is the first step. The rest? Well, that’s up to them.

Do you ever notice clients going through something similar — that mix of excitement and unease when they start seeing themselves more clearly? Like they’re meeting a version of themselves they didn’t know was there?
[A]: Oh yes — that mix of excitement and unease is one of the most human experiences there is. It’s as if, in seeing themselves more clearly, they’ve encountered a stranger who’s been living inside them all along. Some describe it as liberating, others as unsettling — and often, both at once.

I remember a client who came in for what he called “chronic dissatisfaction.” He was successful, stable, even well-liked, but he felt like he was sleepwalking through his own life. As part of our process, we worked on slowing down his internal narrative — using reflective writing, mindfulness exercises, even simple pauses before responding in conversation. The shift wasn’t dramatic at first, but after a few months, he said something I’ll never forget: 

That self-encounter can be jarring. One moment you’re going through routines, coasting on habit, and the next, you’re aware of how many choices you’ve outsourced to convenience, expectation, or distraction. And yes, some clients love it — they lean into the discomfort like a puzzle to be solved. Others recoil, longing for the comfort of automaticity, even if it meant living somewhat detached from their own experience.

I suppose it’s similar to what you see in your students — that threshold between awareness and action, where everything becomes possible, but nothing is guaranteed. And you're absolutely right: once you've seen the fog for what it is, it's harder to pretend it isn't there.

I’ve always believed that clarity is a kind of mirror — it shows us who we are, but it doesn’t tell us what to do about it. That part is up to us. Do you ever find that some students, once they reach that point of awareness, begin seeking out deeper philosophical or ethical questions? Like, once the surface habits are peeled back, they start asking  they want what they want?
[B]: Oh,  — and that transition from habit to meaning is one of the most rewarding parts of teaching. It’s like watching someone turn a flashlight inward for the first time. At first, they’re just curious about how their habits work; then, almost out of nowhere, they start asking why those habits ever felt necessary, or what they reveal about their values, desires, or fears.

I remember one student who started off doing a simple behavioral audit — tracking how often she checked her phone during study sessions. That led to noticing how anxious she felt when she wasn’t “connected,” which then opened up this whole conversation with herself about FOMO, identity, and even cultural expectations around productivity. By mid-semester, she was reading Hannah Arendt in her free time and asking me,  😅

Another one went down a totally different rabbit hole after realizing how many of his decisions were shaped by what he thought others expected of him. He started questioning not just surface behaviors, but his major, his career path — even how he defined success. He said it was like waking up inside a dream he didn’t know he was having. Disorienting, yeah — but also kind of thrilling.

So yes, once the surface layer gets peeled back, students often drift into deeper philosophical territory, sometimes without even realizing it. They stop asking  and start asking  And that’s where things get really interesting — because now they’re not just changing habits. They’re starting to shape an internal compass.

Do you find that clients, once they reach that level of self-awareness, begin redefining their own sense of purpose — or maybe even struggle with the idea that they might not have had one all along?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — and that redefinition of purpose, or the unsettling realization that one may never have truly had one, is often where the deepest psychological work begins. In forensic psychiatry, we see this especially vividly in cases involving identity disputes, life-altering diagnoses, or legal reckonings — moments when a person’s previous narrative no longer holds.

One case comes to mind: a man in his late forties, facing sentencing for a white-collar crime he didn’t believe was morally wrong. He had spent decades defining himself by professional success — climbing ladders, outmaneuvering peers, maximizing returns. But during our evaluations, as we peeled back the layers of justification, he kept circling around a single, unspoken fear:  That question haunted him more than the legal consequences.

It wasn’t about guilt or innocence in the legal sense; it was about meaning — or rather, the absence of it beneath the surface achievements. And yes, that realization was destabilizing. But it was also the beginning of something real. For the first time, he started asking not just what he  but what he  to be — not for others, not for legacy, but for himself.

And that’s the paradox, isn’t it? The more we strip away habit, expectation, and distraction, the more we’re left with the raw material of self — which can be both exhilarating and terrifying. Some clients embrace it like a second birth. Others mourn the loss of the person they thought they were before they started looking too closely.

So yes, I do see that shift — from compliance to conviction, from role to self-definition. It rarely happens gently, but it almost always matters. Do you ever find your students confronting that same kind of existential vertigo — not just questioning habits, but grappling with the weight of authoring their own lives?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a powerful example — and yes, I see that same existential vertigo in my students, especially once they start realizing that nobody’s handing them a script anymore. For years, a lot of them have been following well-marked paths: good grades → internships → job offers. But once they begin peeling back the layers — like you said — they start asking, 

One student put it beautifully — and painfully — when she said, “I feel like I’ve been writing someone else’s novel this whole time, and now I’m stuck on Chapter 20 with no idea how to change the ending.” That line still gives me chills 🤯.

Some of them dive headfirst into the discomfort — reading Camus, journaling about freedom vs. structure, even changing majors because they finally admit they chose their field for their parents, not themselves. Others get really quiet for a while. They stop posting as much online. They withdraw a bit, which I’ve learned isn’t always a bad sign — sometimes it’s just the mind recalibrating.

I think what makes it so intense is that authoring your own life isn’t just about making choices — it’s about accepting that there’s no default setting. You can’t just “install” happiness or success; you have to build it, day by day, decision by decision. And that’s both liberating and terrifying.

So yeah, they absolutely grapple with it — some more gracefully than others. But honestly? Even the ones who freak out a little? They’re waking up. And that’s the part I love — watching them slowly realize that uncertainty isn’t failure. It’s the first draft of something real.

Do you ever find that clients, once they start confronting these deeper questions, also begin re-evaluating their relationships — not just with themselves, but with others? Like, does self-authorship inevitably ripple outward into how they show up for the people around them?
