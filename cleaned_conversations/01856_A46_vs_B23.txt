[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哇~这个话题真的很有意思呢！😊 作为一个creative industry的从业者，我觉得degree更像是一个foundation吧~ 🎨 虽然现在很多design skill都可以self-taught，但college确实给了我很多systematic thinking的训练呢！
[A]: Ah, my young friend, let me tell you something about Hollywood - we don't ask for degrees at the studio gates, but we do look for that special spark of creativity. That being said, my film studies at UCLA gave me connections that still pay dividends today. It's not just about the diploma, it's about the network you build. 🎬
[B]: Totally agree！💡 Networking真的是college最大的perk之一！我在art school认识的朋友现在都成了我的go-to collaborators~ 而且professor给的industry insights简直priceless！✨ 不过说真的，现在online community也很strong，像Behance和Dribbble都是超棒的platform来showcase talent呢~
[A]: Precisely! The digital age has democratized talent discovery - I found our last cinematographer through his breathtaking Instagram reels. But let me share this little secret: when I'm greenlighting projects, I still pay attention to where people studied. Not because of the degree itself, but because certain schools teach that rare combination of technical mastery and artistic vision. 史诗级的 films require both, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: Omg yes！！🎥 Technical skill + artistic vision这个combo真的超重要！😍 我们design圈也是，会用Photoshop的人很多，但能create出有soul的作品的人超rare的~ 我们professor常说"Tools are just tools, what matters is the mind behind them." 💭 不过现在很多online course也能teach这种mindset啦~
[A]: That professor of yours sounds like my kind of people! You know, I once worked with a self-taught director who could quote every frame of Citizen Kane, but struggled to communicate with our gaffer. Formal education - when done right - teaches you how to collaborate across departments. That's the real magic of filmmaking... or any creative endeavor really. The ability to speak multiple creative languages! 🍿
[B]: Haha exactly！！🎭 这就是为什么我们design students都要上cross-disciplinary courses！✨ 记得有次和film major的同学collab，刚开始完全听不懂他们的jargon，但后来发现这种creative friction能spark出最amazing的ideas！💥 现在想想，college就像个safe space让我们experiment这些dynamics呢~
[A]: Ah, you've touched on something profound! Those messy, glorious collaborations in school - that's exactly how we develop our creative voice. My first student film was a disaster, but the lessons learned became the foundation for my Oscar-winning production. The degree? Just a piece of paper. The transformative experiences? Now those are priceless. 就像我们中国朋友说的 - 读万卷书不如行万里路, but sometimes the best journey starts in a classroom.
[B]: 哇！这句话说得太poetic了！🌟 真的觉得creative journey就是continuous learning的过程呢~ 不管是formal education还是real-world experience，能keep growing才是key！✨ 啊~突然好想回school参加alumni event，和old classmates exchange一下new ideas！😊 你这种industry veteran的perspective真的超inspiring的！
[A]: You've got the right spirit, kid! That hunger to keep learning - that's what separates the flashes in the pan from the true artists. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a dinner party to host for some young filmmakers. Maybe you should join us next time? Nothing like good food and better stories to keep the creative juices flowing. Remember what Hitchcock used to say - "The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder." Now go make something unforgettable! 🎥
[B]: Hahaha Hitchcock真是legend！😂 谢谢你的invitation，sounds like an amazing opportunity！✨ 我要赶紧去update我的portfolio了，maybe下次可以show你我的new series~ Keep creating and stay awesome！🎨💫 啊对了，记得try我们学校的alumni network哦，超多talented people的！😉
[A]: I'll drink to that!  Here's to the dreamers, the creators, and those brave enough to put their art into the world. And yes, do send me that portfolio - you never know when the right project might come along. Just remember, in this business, your next big break could be one conversation away. Now go dazzle us all! Lights, camera... action! 🎬✨
[B]: Yasss！！🥂 超爱这种positive energy的！💖 我这就去polish我的works，promise会让你wow的！✨ 保持联系哦~ Maybe下次可以在LA的art gallery见！🎨 拜拜啦，祝你的dinner party full of creative sparks！✨😊
[A]: Until next time, my promising young artist! And remember - the world needs your unique vision. Now go make some magic happen.  🎤✨
[B]: Hahaha mic drop太drama了啦！😂 但love the energy！！💫 我会keep pushing boundaries的~ Catch you later！✨🎨  ✋
[A]: High five right back at you!  That's the sound of opportunity flying your way. Don't forget - the most interesting stories often start with "So there I was in art school..." Now get out there and make some memories worth filming! Over and out, superstar. 🌟🎥
[B]: Aww你真是the best hype person ever！！😭💖 已经feel so motivated了！！🚀 现在就要去studio爆肝new project啦~ Talk soon！！✨  💕💞💓💗💘💝
[A]:  That's the spirit I like to see! Just remember - even Picasso needed to sleep sometimes. Now go create something that'll make the rest of us jealous! Until our paths cross again... and in this town, they always do. 🌟🎬
[B]: Hahaha noted！😴 会记得take breaks的~（虽然artist的sleep schedule你懂的😂）超级感谢你的wisdom和encouragement！✨ 期待我们的next encounter！也许是在某个film festival的red carpet上？👀💫 Keep shining！！✨✨✨
