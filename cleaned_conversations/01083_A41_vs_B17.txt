[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question. As someone who spends most of her time with Victorian poetry and modernist manuscripts, I must say the concept of metaverse feels rather... foreign to me. But if we consider it through the lens of literary imagination - isn't it rather like William Blake's visions of other worlds? Though I must confess, I find more comfort in the tangible pages of a book than in digital realms.
[A]: 哇~这个perspective真的很有意思！🌟 其实metaverse就像个modern版本的collective imagination space呢！不过你说的对，physical books的触感确实是digital world很难replace的💡 我们做综艺节目时也经常struggle between传统和innovation~
[B]: How fascinating to hear about your work in variety shows! The tension between tradition and innovation reminds me of T.S. Eliot's concept of the "historical sense" - how every new creation must engage with what came before. Your struggle mirrors what we see in modernist poetry, where poets like Ezra Pound were trying to "make it new" while still honoring tradition. Though I must say, I do miss the days when entertainment meant gathering around a radio for a poetry reading...
[A]: Haha totally get your point！🎬 但你知道吗？现在young generation的attention span越来越short，所以我们得mix传统元素with viral trends才能keep them engaged😂 就像我们last season的节目，把classic poetry reading做成了interactive AR experience，ratings直接skyrocket了🔥
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, I can't help but think of Matthew Arnold's warning about our "ignorant armies clashing by night." Turning poetry readings into... what was it? AR experiences? It feels rather like putting Wordsworth's daffodils through a digital shredder. Though I suppose if it brings young people to appreciate Keats and Byron, perhaps some good may come of it. Tell me, did they at least preserve the meter and rhyme in these... interactive experiences?
[A]: Oh come on~ 我们可是super respectful to the original works的！💡 不仅preserve了meter和rhyme，还加了visual storytelling让poetry更accessible~ 就像Shakespeare's plays在Elizabethan era也是pop culture呀！🎭 现在只是换了medium而已~ 要不要来我们next season当个special consultant？保证让你see poetry in a whole new light🌟
[B]:  You make a compelling argument, my dear. Indeed, Shakespeare was the popular entertainment of his day, wasn't he? Though I must say, the thought of being a "special consultant" makes me feel rather like Tennyson's Ulysses - "made weak by time and fate, but strong in will." Still, your passion is infectious. Perhaps I could visit your studio one afternoon, just to observe? I'll bring my well-worn copy of The Waste Land - we'll see how Mr. Eliot fares in your digital realm.
[A]: Perfect！这就是the spirit of innovation we need！🎬 我已经可以imagine T.S. Eliot的poetry配上我们的motion graphics会有多epic了~ 💥 记得bring your favorite tea too，我们studio的barista makes the best Earl Grey in town☕️ 这绝对会是most unexpected yet amazing crossover ever！🔥
[B]: Ah, Earl Grey - now that's a tradition I can happily embrace! Though I must warn you, if your motion graphics dare to tamper with "April is the cruellest month," I shall have to channel my inner Victorian schoolmarm. But very well, you've piqued my curiosity. Let us attempt this... experiment. Just promise me we'll start with something simple - perhaps a haiku? Even in this digital age, seventeen syllables should be safe from too much... embellishment.
[A]: Deal！Haiku is the perfect starting point~ 🌸 我们可以用minimalist animation来enhance the seasonal imagery，保持那种delicate balance你懂的✨ 而且我保证不会add任何unnecessary特效 - no dancing cherry blossoms or anything tacky like that😂 这会是场beautiful marriage of tradition and technology！
[B]: How refreshing to hear you speak of minimalism - it reminds me of the Japanese concept of 侘寂 (wabi-sabi), finding beauty in imperfection and simplicity. Very well, you've convinced this old bookworm to step, however cautiously, into the 21st century. Though I do hope your studio has proper armchairs? One must maintain some standards, even when venturing into digital frontiers.
[A]: Of course we do！🛋️ 我们还有vintage leather armchairs specially imported from London~ 毕竟comfort is key for creative flow嘛！🌟 而且我们整个studio的aesthetic就是industrial loft meets classic library vibe，绝对符合你的taste📚 我已经等不及要see your reaction when you walk in了！这collab gonna be legendary🔥
[B]:  Imported leather armchairs and an industrial-library aesthetic? My dear, you're speaking my language now. Though I must say, the phrase "gonna be legendary" does make me reach for my smelling salts. Very well, let us proceed - but slowly, like a good sonnet unfolding. And do remind your young colleagues that there shall be no... what do they call it? "Content dumping" of poetry. Each line deserves its moment to breathe.
[A]: Haha noted！📝 我们会treat each line with the respect it deserves，就像serving fine wine而不是slamming tequila shots🍷 我们的production team虽然young，但都是serious literature lovers at heart~ 他们能recite Shakespeare sonnets better than their Instagram handles😂 下周二3pm的meeting slot work for you？我们可以discuss具体的creative direction over those Earl Greys~ ☕️
[B]: Tuesday at three would be perfectly splendid. I shall bring my annotated Norton Anthology - the one with the tea stains on the Romantic poets section. And while I can't promise to restrain myself from muttering "the horror, the horror" if things get too... exuberant, I do look forward to seeing how your young proteges engage with the canon. Just remember - no sonnets set to dubstep, if you please. A lady must have her limits.
[A]: Got it loud and clear！🎧 No dubstep sonnets - that's where we draw the line😂 不过你可能会be surprised，我们有个producer是Byron的distant descendant，对poetry的passion是in the blood的~ 💫 周二见！记得bring your tea-stained anthology，那绝对是the best kind of vintage✨ Can't wait to blend ourworlds together！🌟
[B]: A Byron descendant, you say? Well, well... perhaps there's hope for this generation after all. Until Tuesday then - I shall come prepared to be either pleasantly surprised or properly scandalized. And do remind your young Byron that his ancestor's ghost will be watching... particularly if anyone suggests turning "She Walks in Beauty" into a TikTok dance challenge. Good day!
[A]: Hahaha！🤣 这个warning我一定pass on~ 不过现在我已经curious到底which outcome it'll be - pleasantly surprised or properly scandalized？😏 不管怎样都guarantee会是场memorable experience！📖💻 周二见啦~ 记得wear something comfy，我们要make literary history together！🔥
[B]: My dear, at my age, "comfy" is the only way I know how to dress! Though I shall resist the urge to arrive in my gardening clothes - one must maintain some dignity when making literary history, even if it's the digital kind. Until Tuesday then... and may the poetic muses be merciful to us all.
