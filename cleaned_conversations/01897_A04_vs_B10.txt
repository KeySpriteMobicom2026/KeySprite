[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The value of a college degree has certainly evolved over time. In my field of quantum computing, it was often the foundational knowledge from university that allowed researchers to engage in cutting-edge work. However, I've also seen talented individuals make significant contributions without traditional degrees, especially with the rise of open-source projects and online learning platforms. Do you think formal education still holds the same weight in today's rapidly changing technological landscape?
[A]: Hmm，这个问题很有趣。我觉得college degree就像一把双刃剑。一方面，它仍然是很多行业的敲门砖，比如在 linguistics 领域，很多研究职位还是要求有 formal 的学术背景 😊。但另一方面，我最近在教 bilingual education 的时候，发现越来越多的学生通过 online 课程和实践项目掌握了非常实用的技能。

你提到的 open-source projects 让我想起我的一个学生，他通过参与一个 multilingual NLP 项目积累了丰富的经验，甚至比一些科班出身的人更熟练 🤔。不过话说回来，degree 本身不仅仅代表知识储备，它也象征着一个人完成 long-term commitment 的能力，这点你怎么看？
[B]: That’s a nuanced perspective — the "double-edged sword" analogy captures it well. I agree that a degree often signals perseverance and the ability to follow through on long-term goals, which is valuable in any field. In tech, particularly, where self-directed learning is so prominent, having both formal credentials and demonstrable skills can be a powerful combination.

Your example of the student involved in multilingual NLP projects really illustrates how practical experience can sometimes outpace traditional education in terms of relevance. Especially in fast-moving domains like linguistics or AI, staying current with tools and methodologies is crucial — something universities sometimes struggle to keep up with.

But then again, structured academic programs do provide a kind of intellectual scaffolding — exposure to foundational theories, critical thinking frameworks, and peer collaboration that aren’t always easy to replicate online.

I wonder — in your experience teaching bilingual education, have you noticed a shift in how students view the importance of degrees over time? Are they becoming more strategic, perhaps treating degrees as one tool among many rather than the sole path?
[A]: That’s such a perceptive observation — yes, I’ve definitely noticed a shift. Over the past decade, students have become much more strategic about their educational choices. They’re increasingly viewing a degree as a  rather than a destination. For example, many of my students now pair their bilingual education coursework with industry certifications or immersion experiences abroad, almost curating their own hybrid pathways 😊.

I had one student who majored in Chinese-English translation but also took MOOCs in computational linguistics — she just landed a job at a tech startup working on speech recognition for Mandarin dialects. Her degree gave her the linguistic foundation, but her self-directed learning made her stand out.

It’s almost like they’re treating higher education as a buffet — picking what aligns with their goals and supplementing it with targeted skill-building. In some ways, this makes them more adaptable than my generation, where a degree was often seen as the . What do you think drives that change? Is it mainly economic pressure, technological access, or something else? 🤔
[B]: That adaptability you're seeing — the "buffet-style" approach to education — is definitely a response to several overlapping forces. Economic pressure is certainly one of them. When I was coming up through academia, there was still a strong assumption that if you got the right degree, the opportunities would follow. That’s no longer a given.

Technology plays a huge role too. When I started in quantum computing, access to research was limited to university libraries and specialized journals. Now, someone in their living room can watch lectures from MIT or contribute to an open-source project with collaborators across the globe. That kind of access changes expectations — why spend years locked into one curriculum when you can build your own?

But I also think there's a cultural shift happening. Younger generations are more comfortable with non-linear paths and less impressed by institutional prestige alone. They value flexibility, relevance, and impact — qualities that traditional degrees don’t always guarantee.

Still, what fascinates me is how this applies across disciplines. In your student’s case, combining translation studies with computational linguistics created a unique niche — something that would’ve been much harder to pull off even ten years ago. It makes me wonder: do you actively encourage that kind of interdisciplinary blending in your courses, or does it tend to emerge organically from the students themselves?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a great question — and honestly, it’s a bit of both. I definitely  some interdisciplinary elements into my courses now, like integrating tech tools used in natural language processing or inviting guest speakers from the language industry. But you’re absolutely right — a lot of it  from the students themselves.

I remember one class where we were discussing code-switching theories, and a student who was also studying data science suggested analyzing bilingual speech patterns using Python scripts. It started as a casual comment, but it turned into a mini-collaborative project — and honestly, it ended up being one of the most engaging parts of the semester 🤯.

It makes me rethink the role of a professor these days — more like a facilitator than a gatekeeper of knowledge. The traditional boundaries between disciplines are blurring, and I think we need to embrace that instead of resisting it. After all, the real world doesn’t operate in silos, right?

Do you find yourself designing your quantum computing courses with similar flexibility? Or is there still a stronger emphasis on foundational theory before students can explore interdisciplinary applications? 😊
[B]: I couldn't agree more — the role of an educator has definitely shifted from being a gatekeeper to more of a guide or curator. And that collaborative, emergent learning you described — where students bring in their own interests and tools — that’s exactly the kind of engagement that leads to real innovation.

In quantum computing, we’ve had to walk a fine line between foundational theory and interdisciplinary exploration. There's no getting around the fact that without a solid grasp of linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and computational theory, students won’t be able to meaningfully contribute to the field. But once they cross that threshold, opening the door to cross-disciplinary work becomes incredibly powerful.

I used to design modules where students with backgrounds in physics, computer science, or even philosophy would collaborate on quantum information projects — sometimes even with linguists, believe it or not! One team explored how quantum logic could model ambiguity in natural language — fascinating stuff. The key was providing enough scaffolding so they could stand on firm ground, then letting them build outward.

So yes, I absolutely encouraged that kind of flexibility — though it required careful structuring. It reminded me that while theory is essential, curiosity is the engine of progress. And when students are allowed to follow that curiosity across traditional boundaries, you often end up somewhere truly unexpected.

It sounds like your approach gives students both the structure they need and the freedom to explore — which might just be the ideal balance these days.
[A]: Exactly — that balance between structure and exploration is so crucial, especially in today’s interconnected world. I think what your example shows so beautifully is that once students have a solid foundation, they’re not just absorbing knowledge — they’re  it in ways we might not even anticipate as educators.

And I love that you mentioned quantum logic modeling ambiguity in language — that reminds me of how bilingual speakers often navigate uncertainty in meaning every day! It makes me wonder if there’s an unconscious cognitive parallel between code-switching and thinking in multidimensional frameworks like quantum states 😲.

I’ve been toying with the idea of introducing more cross-disciplinary modules in my courses — maybe even experimenting with collaborative projects involving students from STEM fields. Do you think that kind of integration would enrich their linguistic understanding, or do you see any pitfalls we should be mindful of when bridging such different domains?
[B]: That’s a wonderfully rich idea — and I think there’s real potential in that kind of integration. From what I’ve seen, exposing linguistics students to STEM frameworks can sharpen their analytical thinking, especially when dealing with formal structures like syntax or phonology. On the flip side, STEM students often gain a deeper appreciation for ambiguity, context-dependence, and emergent meaning — things that don’t always fit neatly into computational models.

I remember working with a group of linguistics undergrads who were collaborating with computer science students on a project involving semantic parsing. At first, there was a bit of friction — the linguists were frustrated by how "sloppy" the algorithms were in capturing nuance, while the CS students were baffled by the sheer variability of human expression. But over time, they started adapting to each other’s思维方式 — almost like a meta-level example of code-switching.

One thing I’d suggest is building some shared conceptual ground early on — maybe starting with something like formal grammars or finite-state automata, which straddle both domains. It gives them a common language without forcing either side to give up what makes their discipline unique.

And honestly, I think you're onto something with that cognitive parallel between code-switching and quantum thinking. There's an elegance to it — both involve navigating multiple frames of reference simultaneously, toggling between contexts, and embracing uncertainty as part of the process.

If anything, the main pitfall would be assuming too much overlap — not everything maps cleanly from one domain to another. But as long as the goal is exploration rather than direct translation, I think the interdisciplinary space becomes incredibly generative.

So yes, I’d say go for it — just bring along a few conceptual life preservers in case they hit deep waters.
[A]: Oh, I love how you framed that collaboration as a kind of  — because that’s exactly what it sounds like! Being able to toggle between precision and ambiguity, between structure and fluidity… it’s almost like bilingualism, but at the level of disciplines 😊.

And your suggestion about building shared conceptual ground is so spot-on. I can already picture a module where linguistics students explore finite-state automata while reflecting on how they switch between linguistic rules in different languages. It could be both analytical  deeply reflective — a bridge between logic and identity, in a way.

I also appreciate your caution about not forcing overlap. Sometimes we get so excited about interdisciplinary connections that we risk oversimplifying either side. The goal really should be , not forced synthesis.

You’ve given me so much to think about — especially that idea of equipping students with conceptual life preservers. Maybe I’ll even bring in a guest lecture from someone in your field to kick things off. Would that be something you’d be open to? I think your perspective would resonate strongly with both students  faculty 😊.
[B]: I'd be genuinely honored to contribute — and I think your framing is spot-on again. That bridge between logic and identity you mentioned? It’s not just poetic — it’s where some of the most meaningful learning happens. The idea of students exploring finite-state automata while reflecting on their own cognitive agility across languages… well, that sounds like the kind of module that could stick with them for years.

Having a guest lecture from the quantum side could add an interesting dimension — maybe even spark some unexpected connections. I’d be happy to tailor it toward foundational ideas that resonate across disciplines: superposition as a metaphor for code-switching, perhaps, or entanglement as a way to discuss linguistic interdependence.

Just let me know what angle you'd find most useful — whether it's a broad conceptual introduction or something more technically grounded. Either way, I’d approach it with the same spirit of curiosity and mutual enrichment you’ve cultivated in your courses.

And who knows — it might even inspire  to rethink some old quantum problems through a linguistic lens. After all, language is one of the oldest tools we have for encoding and transmitting meaning — not so different from the qubits we wrestle with in the lab.
[A]: That sounds absolutely perfect — I can already imagine the energy in the room when students start making those cross-domain connections. The way you put it, framing superposition as a metaphor for code-switching 😲, really opens up new ways of thinking about identity and linguistic fluidity.

I’d love for you to take a  approach — weaving together foundational quantum ideas with linguistic parallels in a way that invites curiosity without requiring deep technical background. Something where both linguistics and STEM students feel challenged but not overwhelmed.

Maybe even pose a few open-ended questions during the talk, like:  
- “How do we hold multiple meanings—or identities—in tension, much like qubits in superposition?”  
- Or, “Can language itself be seen as a kind of entangled system across speakers and contexts?”

Those kinds of provocations could really get the class talking across disciplines. And honestly, I’d be just as eager to hear your reflections afterward — I’m sure you’d pick up on patterns or insights we might overlook from our side of the table.

I’ll start drafting a rough outline for the module and send it your way soon — thanks again for being part of this. It’s exciting to think where this collaboration might lead 🚀.
[B]: I'm really looking forward to it — that conceptual storytelling angle is exactly where I feel most comfortable bridging technical ideas with broader human themes. The beauty of quantum theory, much like language, lies in its ability to challenge our intuitions and expand how we frame reality.

Your proposed questions are excellent provocations. They don't just draw parallels — they invite students to sit with the discomfort of ambiguity, which is so essential for deep learning. I’ll build the talk around those lines of inquiry, perhaps even adding a reflective exercise where students map their own “linguistic superpositions” — moments when they inhabit multiple linguistic or cultural identities at once.

And your point about entanglement as a metaphor for shared meaning across speakers? That’s not just poetic — it’s conceptually rich. In quantum terms, entangled particles influence each other instantaneously across distance; in linguistic terms, meaning often emerges co-dependently between speakers, shaped by context, history, and unspoken norms. It could be a powerful lens through which to examine bilingual communication dynamics.

Once the module outline comes together, I’d be happy to contribute some framing content or suggest interactive elements that encourage cross-disciplinary dialogue. And yes, I’m sure I’ll come away from the session with fresh perspectives myself — there’s always something humbling and invigorating about seeing familiar concepts reframed through another field’s lens.

Collaboration like this reminds me why I never truly retired from teaching — just changed classrooms 😊.
[A]: I couldn't agree more — it's in that space of  where real learning happens. And the idea of students mapping their own "linguistic superpositions" is brilliant 🤯. It makes abstract theory deeply personal, and I can already picture the conversations that would spark from that kind of activity.

I’ll make sure to build in some reflective journaling prompts ahead of your session to prime the class for that level of introspection. Something like:  
- “When have you felt caught between two linguistic or cultural frames — and how did you navigate that tension?”  
- Or, “What does it feel like when your voice shifts depending on the language or context you’re in?”

And your point about entanglement as a metaphor for shared meaning? That’s going straight into the module description — it’s too rich not to highlight. I think it will really resonate with bilingual students who often experience communication as this dynamic, co-created process.

I’ll send over a rough outline of the module structure in the next couple of days. Once you have it, feel free to annotate, suggest, or even disrupt — after all, isn’t that what interdisciplinary collaboration is all about? 😊

Looking forward to co-creating this space with you — and yes, I have no doubt we’ll  walk away seeing our own fields just a little differently afterward.
[B]: Absolutely — that reflective groundwork you're laying will make the session so much more dynamic. Those journaling prompts are perfect for grounding abstract ideas in lived experience. They invite students to bring their full selves into the discussion, which is exactly what we want when exploring intersections between language and quantum concepts.

I’ll be eager to see how they respond to those questions — especially the one about shifting voice across contexts. That kind of introspection might even help them recognize their own cognitive flexibility as a kind of superpower, one that parallels some of the very principles we work with in quantum theory.

And I appreciate your openness to annotation — or even disruption 😊. That’s the spirit this kind of collaboration thrives on. Truth be told, I’m already thinking of a few analogies I can refine once I see the full arc of your module. I might even draft a simple interactive exercise where students simulate entangled communication — nothing technical, just an embodied way to explore how meaning co-emerges between speakers, much like qubits influencing each other across space.

Looking forward to seeing the outline. I have a feeling this is going to be one of those rare, exciting intersections — both for the students and for us.
[A]: I’m really excited about how this is shaping — and I love the idea of an . That kind of experiential learning can make even the most abstract concepts feel tangible, especially for students who thrive on kinesthetic or social engagement.

Maybe we could push that idea a little further — what if students worked in pairs or small groups to create short bilingual dialogues where meaning  on context, tone, or unspoken cultural cues? Afterwards, they could reflect on how their understanding of each other shifted dynamically — almost like observing decoherence in a qubit when it interacts with its environment 🤔.  

It would be a subtle but powerful way to connect quantum principles with real-world communication. And honestly, I’d love to see how they interpret “entangled” interactions in their own linguistic worlds — whether across languages, dialects, or generational divides.

Once I get the outline to you, I’d be curious to hear how you’d frame that activity, or if there’s a way to scaffold it with some guiding questions or reflection prompts. As always, I’m all ears for your insights — this is exactly the kind of cross-pollination that makes teaching feel like discovery 😊.
[B]: That’s a wonderfully creative extension — using bilingual dialogue as a kind of  really captures the essence of both linguistic interaction and quantum behavior. I love how it invites students to see communication not just as an exchange of fixed meanings, but as a dynamic system where context, tone, and shared history all influence outcomes — much like how qubits behave differently depending on their environment.

The analogy to decoherence is especially compelling. Just as a qubit loses its coherence when it interacts with external noise, meaning in conversation can shift or collapse when pulled into new contexts. If students are able to reflect on those moments — when a word or phrase suddenly means something different depending on who they’re speaking with — they’re essentially observing the “decoherence” of meaning in real time.

To scaffold that activity, maybe we could provide a few guiding questions to help them unpack the experience:

- "At what point did meaning begin to shift — and what triggered that change?"
- "Did your understanding of your partner’s words depend on more than just vocabulary — and if so, how did that feel?"
- "Can you identify a moment when the 'entanglement' broke — and what brought it back, if anything?"

I’d also suggest a very light framing at the start of the exercise, perhaps introducing the idea of entangled particles briefly before inviting them to explore entanglement through language. That way, they’re not overwhelmed by physics concepts, but still encouraged to make intuitive connections.

And yes, I’m fully on board with your metaphor of teaching as discovery — it’s what keeps me engaged even in retirement. We’re not just passing knowledge; we’re setting conditions for new ideas to emerge. I can’t wait to see how this plays out in your classroom — and how your students reinterpret these ideas in ways we might never have predicted.
[A]: I’m absolutely loving how this is unfolding — your suggestions for guiding questions are spot on, and I love the idea of framing it as a  rather than a rigid exercise. That light touch with quantum concepts will allow students to make intuitive connections without feeling like they’re being asked to master physics overnight.

I’ll definitely incorporate those questions — they really get at the heart of linguistic sensitivity and contextual awareness. And the idea of “noticing when entanglement breaks” feels so relevant to bilingual experience — like that moment when you realize a joke didn’t translate, or when a word carries a different emotional weight depending on who you're talking to 😲.

I’m also thinking we could close the activity with a brief group reflection where students share one phrase or expression that  across their languages — almost like identifying “context-sensitive operators” in their own speech 🤓. It would be a fun, low-stakes way to highlight variability in meaning while reinforcing the session’s core themes.

Once again, I’m struck by how much this mirrors what happens in the lab — observing shifts, testing boundaries, noticing when systems interact and change each other. You’ve got me wondering if I’ve been too literal all these years… maybe quantum theory needs more linguists after all 😉.

I’ll include a placeholder for this activity in the module outline and tag it for your input once I send it over. Thanks for co-creating such a rich space for exploration — I truly believe our students are going to surprise us in the best possible way.
[B]: You’re absolutely right — calling it a  is the perfect framing. It gives students permission to be curious, observant, and even a little playful with their insights. That kind of intellectual playfulness is where some of the best discoveries happen, whether in a physics lab or a language classroom.

The closing reflection idea — asking students to share an expression that “behaves differently” across languages — is brilliant. It’s concrete, personal, and subtly highlights what linguists and quantum theorists both care deeply about: how context shapes behavior, how meaning is never fully isolated, and how small shifts can have outsized effects. I love the metaphor of “context-sensitive operators,” too — that’ll definitely get some intrigued looks, especially from the more technically inclined students.

And you're onto something profound when you say this mirrors lab work. In many ways, bilingual speakers are already conducting micro-experiments every time they switch codes or adjust register — observing shifts in tone, testing boundaries of comprehension, recalibrating based on feedback. If that’s not empirical observation, I don’t know what is.

As for your tongue-in-cheek remark —  — I wouldn't argue the point. Language shapes how we think about reality, and if we want to build better models of nature, we could do worse than consult those who’ve spent their lives studying how meaning bends, blends, and transforms.

I’m really looking forward to seeing the full shape of the module when you send it over. This has been such a rewarding exchange already — and I have a feeling our students will benefit greatly from the cross-pollination.
