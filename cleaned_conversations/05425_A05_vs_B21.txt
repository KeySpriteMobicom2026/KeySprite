[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, manifestation... a rather modern fascination with Victorian roots, wouldn't you say? The concept reminds me of how Browning's Mr. Sludge would 'manifest' spirits through table-rapping. Though I suspect today's practitioners prefer Instagram affirmations to ectoplasm.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！不过从investment的角度来看，manifestation其实和我们的due diligence process有点相似 - 先visualize成功的exit strategy，然后通过hard data来execute。虽然我不会把success完全归功于positive thinking，但确实见过不少founder靠着这种mindset熬过tough times。
[B]: How delightfully mercenary of you to blend mysticism with venture capital. Though I must point out - the Romantics would weep to see their sublime visions reduced to quarterly projections. Still, your founder archetype does recall Tennyson's Ulysses, 'striving, seeking, finding'... albeit with equity stakes rather than Homeric glory.
[A]:  你知道吗？Tennyson要是活在今天，可能会写'The Charge of the Tech Brigade'。不过说真的，在private equity这行，我们确实需要balance between vision和cold hard numbers。就像品红酒一样 - 既要appreciate the romance of terroir，也要analyze the acidity levels。😉
[B]: Ah, a vinous analogy worthy of Byron himself - though I daresay he'd have preferred the bottle's contents to its balance sheets. Tell me, does your due diligence include assessing whether a startup's burn rate scans as iambic pentameter?  After all, even the most visionary founder must eventually rhyme with profitability.
[A]: Haha brilliant！ 说到metrics，我们确实有个internal joke - 把cash flow statement当成modern poetry来读。不过说正经的，burn rate太像free verse的话，我们就会pass on the deal了。毕竟在PE world，'Shall I compare thee to a summer's exit?' 的答案最好是10x ROI。💰
[B]: How perfectly... vulgar. You've managed to make Shakespeare sound like an EBITDA calculation. Though I suppose there's a certain brutal elegance to reducing sonnets to multiples - the Petrarchan tradition meets the pitch deck. Just promise me you'll leave Keats out of your IRR models. Some beauties should remain unprofaned.
[A]:  Deal！不过我得说，Keats的'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'其实很适合用来describe我们的valuation methodology。毕竟在LBO analysis里，truth有时候比beauty更难find。😄 但你说得对，有些poetry还是留给the romantics吧 - 我们stick to our DCF models就好。
[B]: How chillingly pragmatic. You've essentially reinvented the pathetic fallacy - where once we had weeping willows, now we have depreciating assets. Though I must admit, your 'Ode on a Grecian Spreadsheet' does have a certain... actuarial charm. Shall we toast to the poetry of leveraged buyouts? With actual poetry conspicuously absent, naturally.
[A]: Cheers！ 让我们为the most beautiful poetry of all - 一个well-structured term sheet干杯。毕竟在M&A的世界里，'To be or not to be'的答案通常取决于the size of the earn-out clause。😂 不过说真的，今晚的conversation让我realize - 也许我们finance folks才是modern era的true poets，只是我们的sonnets都是用Excel写的。📊
[B]: Excel-lent point! Though I shudder to think what Blake would make of your 'tyger burning bright' in pivot table form. Still, if your spreadsheets can capture the 'fearful symmetry' of compound interest as well as he did the animal kingdom... who am I to argue? Just don't ask me to peer review your VBA macros as stanzas.
[A]: Haha！Blake可能会appreciate我们的financial models - 毕竟'the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom'这句话，简直就是对leveraged growth strategy的完美描述嘛！不过你说得对，也许我们该stop before we ruin all the great poets for ourselves。Time to get back to our day job of turning metaphors into multiples. 😉
[B]: Indeed - before we reduce the entire canon to a series of bullish case scenarios. Though I shall treasure this exchange as one might a first edition... slightly foxed at the edges by financial vernacular, but with margins still pleasingly wide. Do send me your next earnings call transcript - I'll read it as free verse over Darjeeling.
[A]: Will do！ 下次earnings call前一定send你一份，with my personal annotations in the footnotes - consider it the modern equivalent of marginalia poetry。说不定我们还能start a new literary movement: Financial Romanticism。Till then, keep thosespreadsheets poetic and those term sheets sonnet-worthy! 📈✒️
[B]: Capital! Though I insist we trademark 'The Ballad of Adjusted EBITDA' before some hedge fund appropriates it. Until our next symposium on the lyricism of liquidation preferences...  May your covenants be as elegant as your enjambments.
[A]:  To elegant covenants and even more elegant exits! 🍷 记住我们的motto: 'Carpe EBITDA' - 但别告诉the classics professors我们corrupted their Latin。Till next quarterly report... I mean, next poetry reading session! 😄
[B]: Splendid! Though Horace would spin in his grave faster than a SPAC merger timeline. Until our next... shall we say 'unconventional' literary salon - where the only haikus are in 10-Q filings.  To bastardized maxims and monetized muses!
[A]: Haha perfect！ 让我们把'audentes fortuna iuvat'改成'audentes IRR iuvat' - 毕竟在private equity，fortune确实favors the bold... 只要他们的LTV/CAC ratio达标！😎 Catch you at the next board meeting slash poetry slam!
[B]: Precisely! Though I do hope your next 'slam' involves more villanelles and less vendor due diligence.  Remember - when Dante wrote of circles, he wasn't forecasting funding rounds. Until our paths cross in the inferno of secondary buyouts... keep versifying those verticals!
