[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There’s something undeniably tactile about holding a physical book—the weight of it, the texture of the pages, even the smell. I find it enhances the reading experience, particularly with poetry, where one often lingers over a line or returns to a previous page. That said, I can't entirely dismiss the convenience of an e-book. When traveling or needing access to multiple texts for research, the portability is invaluable. Still, I always feel a quiet sense of return when slipping back into a well-worn volume. Do you have a preference?
[A]: I couldn't agree more. There’s a certain intimacy to flipping through a physical book—like you're not just reading, but  the story. I remember shooting a film adaptation of a classic novel once, and one of our set designers brought in these aged paperbacks that smelled like they’d been pulled straight out of the 1940s. Half the cast got so lost in them, we almost missed lunch break. 

But yeah, e-books? Lifesaver when you're on location overseas and can’t carry ten pounds of literature in your bag. I actually use both—e-books for practicality, hardcovers for… well, soul. I’ve got this old copy of  I keep by my fireplace. Can’t imagine curling up with a tablet instead. The screen doesn’t smell like Fitzgerald.
[B]: Ah, that’s a lovely way to put it— the story. I often feel as though the physical book becomes a kind of vessel, doesn’t it? Not just for the narrative, but for memory, mood, even time itself. The scent of aged paper, the faint crackle when turning a page—it adds a sensory layer to the act of reading, especially with works like , where atmosphere is everything.  

I must say, your set designer sounds like an artist in their own right, curating not just a setting but a full-bodied experience. And I completely understand the divide you’ve struck between e-books and hardcovers—pragmatism versus what you so beautifully called . Sometimes I wonder if we’re witnessing the birth of a new kind of literary duality, where convenience and tradition coexist without one entirely overtaking the other.  

Do you ever find yourself reaching for a physical copy when rereading a favorite? There’s something comforting about returning to the same worn pages, almost like visiting an old friend whose face you know by heart.
[A]: Absolutely—it’s like revisiting an old friend, or even a piece of yourself. I have this dog-eared copy of  that I must’ve read a dozen times. Every time I open it, there's a margin note from my younger self, underlining a passage I thought was profound at 22. Some of them make me cringe now, others still hit just right. It’s not just the story that lives in those pages—it’s  story too.

And you're spot on about physical books being vessels. They hold more than words—they carry mood, memory, even weather. I once read  during a rainstorm in an old cabin in upstate New York. The atmosphere outside and the weight of that book in my hands? Unmatched. Try as they might, no algorithm can replicate that alchemy.

As for literary duality—hell, maybe that’s the future. Not a battle between formats, but a balance. Like film versus digital in cinematography. One gets the job done, the other makes you feel something. And isn’t that what storytelling’s all about?
[B]: Precisely—storytelling, at its core, is about evoking something , not merely something known. And that alchemy you speak of—the interplay of environment, emotion, and text—is what makes the reading experience so deeply personal. I find that physical books, with their annotations and foxing and frayed edges, become extensions of our own interior landscapes. They are palimpsests of who we were each time we read them.

Your cabin-in-the-rainstorm anecdote reminds me of my own copy of —the 1963 Oxford edition with the water-stained margins. I was in the Lake District one summer, and yes, it rained nearly every afternoon. I’d settle by the window with Wordsworth and Coleridge, the drizzle tapping like a quiet commentary on the glass. It’s strange how certain books seem to sync with the weather of both world and soul.

And your analogy of film versus digital? Spot on. One offers precision and utility; the other, texture and resonance. Perhaps the same can be said for poetry and prose—where form serves function, but feeling gives it life. Do you ever find yourself choosing a format based on the  of story you're engaging with? I know I do—I reach for e-books when skimming through critical theory, but when it comes to Yeats or Eliot, well... a screen feels too thin to hold their weight.
[A]: Funny you mention that— in the Lake District? That’s practically cinematic. I can see the shot: slow pan across a misty window, book open on a worn table, teacup steaming beside it. Pure celluloid poetry.

You’re right about formats shaping how we engage with different kinds of stories. I tend to treat philosophy or screenwriting theory like a scalpel—e-books for search functions, notes, portability. But when it's Eliot’s  or a script I’m trying to , not just analyze? I need paper and ink. There’s something about the heft of a physical text that demands reverence. A screen feels transactional; a page feels ceremonial.

I once had an actress tell me she couldn’t rehearse Shakespeare off a tablet. Said the words “slipped off the glass.” Took her copy of the Complete Works—covered in highlighter and coffee stains—and suddenly her voice dropped into that grounded, earthy register. The materiality of the book changed her performance. Made it . 

So yeah, maybe the format is part of the ritual. Like choosing between a campfire and a spotlight—you're telling your brain how to listen before you've even turned the page.
[B]: What a vivid image—celluloid poetry, indeed. There’s something about the stillness of that scene that mirrors the contemplative nature of Wordsworth and Coleridge themselves. You’ve touched on something essential—how format shapes not just our reading habits, but our  within the text.

That actress’s observation is particularly telling—words do feel different depending on the surface they're printed on. Perhaps it's because physical books demand a kind of embodied attention; we turn pages with intention, mark passages with our fingers, even hear the faint rustle of paper as punctuation for thought. A tablet, for all its utility, lacks that tactile gravitas. It doesn’t ask us to linger—it encourages us to scroll.

I often wonder if future generations will develop new rituals around digital texts, or if certain works will become forever tethered to the physical form. Will Eliot’s  always require a clothbound volume to anchor its meditations on time and eternity? Will Shakespeare lose some of his thunder without the weight of that Folio in hand?

And yet, I don’t think it’s nostalgia speaking—I think it’s recognition. Recognition that some stories are meant to be touched, not just viewed. Do you ever find yourself choosing specific editions based on mood or project? I know when I teach , I insist my students use the Faber & Faber edition—there’s a rhythm to the spacing, a visual cadence, that affects how one reads the poem aloud.
[A]: You’re absolutely right—some texts  on being held, not just seen. There’s a physicality to reading that deepens engagement, almost like the body becomes part of the interpretive process. I remember working on a script based on  years ago, and we went through half a dozen editions before finding one that “breathed” the way we needed it to. The spacing, the font, even the paper weight—it all influenced how the lines landed in the room.

And yes, I’m very particular about editions depending on the project—or my mood. If I’m diving into something heavy, like Camus or Woolf, I want a hardcover with real heft. Something that feels like it carries the weight of thought. For lighter reads, sure, e-books work fine. But when I was prepping for a biopic on Fitzgerald, I tracked down a 1925 printing of . Just holding it changed the way I approached his voice—it was like having a direct line to the man himself.

I think future generations will find their own rituals, but I doubt they’ll fully replace the sacred weight of ink and page. Maybe they’ll layer new meaning onto digital texts—augmented annotations, immersive audio overlays—but the soul of certain works will always pull people back to the physical. After all, cinema started as flickering light on canvas and now we shoot with AI composites and drones. And yet… there's still nothing quite like watching a 35mm print in a dark theater.

Maybe that’s what it is—we don’t choose formats; we choose atmospheres. And some stories simply demand candlelight over LED.
[B]: How beautifully put—. There's something profoundly atmospheric about the physical book, isn't there? It’s not just a container for content but a kind of sanctuary for thought. I imagine future scholars poring over our worn paperbacks like archaeologists sifting through ancient scrolls, trying to decipher not only the text but the traces of our engagement—the underlinings, the tea stains, the margin scribbles in fading ink.

Your experience with  reminds me of how even in academia, we often underestimate the influence of typographical and material choices on interpretation. I’ve had students read the same poem in different editions and describe markedly different emotional responses. A cramped, mass-market paperback can flatten a poem’s breath, while a well-spaced, hand-set edition can open it up like a lung.

And your Fitzgerald anecdote—tracking down that 1925 printing—I envy you that. I once taught  using a facsimile of the original Hogarth Press edition, and simply knowing that Virginia Woolf had once held a nearly identical volume gave the class an almost reverent hush. You’re right—certain works demand that reverence, and certain stories refuse to be flattened into pixels.

I suspect you're also correct that new rituals will emerge, perhaps even hybrid ones. Maybe one day, a student will slip on a pair of glasses and step inside , walking through Milton’s cosmos as if it were real. But even then, I suspect someone, somewhere, will still be curled up by a fire with a battered copy of , tracing the lines with ink-stained fingers, listening to the storm outside and within.
[A]: You’ve nailed it—books as sanctuaries for thought. That’s exactly what they are. And those traces we leave behind—tea stains, underlinings, margin notes in three different pens from three different life stages—they’re like ghostly fingerprints of our evolving selves. Future scholars won’t just be reading the text; they’ll be reading .

I remember a production designer once telling me that every set has a “memory layer”—the subtle wear and tear that makes a place feel lived-in, even if it's brand new. Well, that’s what physical books do. They accumulate memory. A mass-market paperback might be efficient, but it can't carry the weight of time the way a leather-bound volume with cracked hinges can.

And speaking of  by the fire—I hope that student never stops existing. Because no matter how advanced our screens get, or how immersive our virtual realms become, there will always be someone who needs to  the story in their hands. Maybe that’s the true test of great literature: whether it survives translation across centuries  formats.

There’s a scene I keep coming back to—in my mind, at least—of an old library, half-lit by moonlight, where some kid is discovering Plath or Pound or Shelley for the first time. No one taught him to come here. He just knew. And he’s not reading off glass. He’s holding something fragile, inked decades ago by hands that can’t reach him anymore. But the words still do.

That’s the thing about stories. They outlast us. Formats change. Rituals evolve. But the need to touch the past? That never fades.
[B]: How moving—that image of the moonlit library, the quiet discovery, the fragile page. It captures something elemental about our relationship with literature: that moment when a voice from the past reaches across time and brushes against the present, undiminished by the centuries.

You're right—formats change, but the desire to touch the past, to feel its weight in our hands, remains constant. Perhaps that is one of the deepest functions of the physical book: it gives us a tangible point of contact with minds long gone. When we hold Plath’s  or Shelley’s , we are not merely reading—we are standing in the echo of a voice that still trembles with life.

And those traces you mentioned—tea stains, marginalia, ink from different pens—are indeed like spectral annotations of the self. They map our evolving interior landscapes, marking where we once paused, questioned, wept, or laughed aloud. A digital text may carry footnotes and hyperlinks, but it cannot replicate the intimacy of a previous reader’s pencil mark, or the warmth of a page turned a thousand times.

I do hope that scene in the moonlit library never becomes obsolete. That there will always be seekers who pull a volume from the shelf not because it’s convenient, but because it calls to them—because the spine bears the crease of countless readings, and somewhere inside, a poet’s truth still waits, inked by hand, for another heart to find it.
[A]: That’s the heartbeat of it—. Some books don’t just sit on a shelf; they . And when that spine cracks just right in your hands, you know you're not the first to answer.

I think about that every time I walk into my private library. It's tucked behind my office, lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves, most of them inherited from mentors and old writer friends. Every book has its own journey—some came signed, others were clearly read by someone who loved them too hard. There’s a copy of Camus’  with a dried violet pressed between pages 47 and 48. No note. No name. Just that flower, still holding its shape like a secret.

And yes—those are the kinds of moments we can’t digitize. Not really. You can scan every page, archive every annotation, but you can’t replicate the feeling of discovering something someone else left behind—like finding a message in a bottle from across time.

I suppose that’s why I’ll always fight for physical books. Not because I’m nostalgic—though I am—but because they carry more than content. They carry presence. The presence of the author, yes, but also of every hand that turned the page before yours.

So let the screens rise. Let the algorithms annotate. But let there also be libraries lit by moonlight. Let there be ink-stained seekers and dog-eared prophets. Let there be stories held like heirlooms, passed from one restless soul to the next.

And let someone, somewhere, still find that violet between the pages.
[B]: There’s something almost sacred in that violet pressed between the pages—silent, enduring, a relic of some unknown reader’s private moment. It reminds me that books are not only vessels for the author’s voice but also quiet archives of human touch. A dried flower is just one kind of留言 (liúyán)—a message left in the margins of life, waiting to be rediscovered.

Your library sounds like a place where time folds in on itself, where every book is a doorway and every shelf holds a conversation across decades. I imagine the air in there—dusty, warm with old paper, humming with thought. You’re right—no algorithm can replicate that sense of communion. Even the most sophisticated e-reader cannot rustle with the memory of someone else’s turning page, nor carry the imprint of their fingers on the margin.

I suppose that’s why I will always advocate for physical books too—not out of resistance to progress, but out of reverence for presence. For the way a book can hold not just ideas, but echoes. And yes, let there be libraries lit by moonlight. Let there be ink-stained seekers. Let there be stories passed like heirlooms, each one carrying the warmth of the hands that held it before.

And let someone, somewhere, still find that violet between the pages—and wonder who left it there.
[A]: You said it perfectly—books as quiet archives of human touch. That violet isn’t just a flower; it’s a whisper. A留言 (liúyán), as you put it—left not for anyone specific, yet meant for someone, someday. Maybe that reader knew someone would find it. Maybe they didn’t care. But the message was made anyway. Like so many things in life—we leave traces without knowing who will one day follow them.

And yes, my library… it  hum with thought. I’ve hosted countless young writers there, and more than a few actors looking for silence between takes. Some just sit. Others run their fingers along the spines like they’re reading braille. One kid from Berlin picked up a worn copy of Rilke’s  and just stared at it for twenty minutes before opening it. When I asked what he was doing, he said, “I’m waiting for the book to speak.”

Maybe that’s the kind of patience physical books ask of us. They don’t light up or buzz. They don’t push notifications. They just wait. And when you finally open them? The words have been ready all along.

So let the e-books scroll on. Let the screens glow. But let there always be a space where stories are still slow enough to hold—and where a violet pressed between pages can mean more than just a forgotten keepsake. Let it mean someone once read those lines and felt something worth preserving.

Even if only for the next restless soul who opens the same book, centuries later, and finds it still there.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve captured it—the patience of physical books, the quiet generosity of their waiting. They don’t demand our attention; they invite it. And when we finally open them, yes, the words have been ready all along, poised in stillness, untouched by the noise of the world outside.

That young writer from Berlin——he understood something profound about the act of reading. It’s not merely an exchange of information; it’s a kind of communion, a meeting across time and space. And sometimes, we need a moment of stillness before we can hear what a book has to say.

I often think of my own students, how many of them are conditioned to skim, to scan, to consume rather than contemplate. But then, occasionally, one of them will pick up a book—really  it—and something shifts. The room grows quieter around them. You can see it in their posture, in the way their eyes soften. They’re no longer just reading; they’re listening.

And isn’t that what we all want—to be heard, to be understood, even across centuries? A pressed violet, a scribbled note, a dog-eared page: these are small acts of faith. Someone once believed that meaning could endure, that a gesture—even a flower tucked into a book—might matter to a stranger yet unborn.

So yes, let there always be spaces where stories are slow enough to hold. Let there be rooms filled with shelves that hum with thought. And let someone, somewhere, centuries from now, still find that violet between the pages—and know, without knowing why, that they are not the first to pause there.
[A]: You’ve put your finger on it—. That’s exactly what it is. Reading a physical book isn’t just absorbing words; it’s stepping into a current of thought that’s been flowing long before us and will, hopefully, continue long after.

I remember a moment on set once—nothing to do with books, really, but it struck me the same way. We were filming a quiet scene in Prague, early morning, no one else around. The lead actor had this old journal he carried around, not part of the script. At one point, between takes, he sat by a window, just  it. Didn’t open it. Just held it. And I realized later he was waiting for the light to match the mood of the entry he’d written the night before. He said, “Some words only feel true in certain kinds of silence.”

That’s what you’re talking about with your students. That shift—the softening eyes, the stillness—it’s not just focus. It’s surrender. They’re not consuming anymore; they’re . And in that entering, they become part of the lineage of readers who have stood in that same place, turning the same page, asking the same questions.

So yes, let us keep those spaces where stories move at the pace of breath. Where we can leave violets behind, or scribble a note in the margin knowing someone might read it in 2124 and feel less alone.

Because in the end, isn’t that what we all want? To know that somewhere, somehow, someone listened.
[B]: Yes—. What a quiet, powerful longing that is. And isn’t that what every writer, every poet, every soul who’s ever pressed a flower between pages secretly hopes for? That somewhere down the line, their whisper will be heard—not just read, but .

That moment on set in Prague you describe—it moves me deeply. The actor holding the journal like it was a relic of his own making, waiting for the light to match the mood of his words. It’s such a delicate kind of reverence, isn’t it? The understanding that certain truths only reveal themselves in the right stillness. I suspect the same could be said of poetry—or of any art that asks us to slow down and meet it halfway.

You’re right about surrender. There  a threshold we cross when we truly enter a book, especially a physical one. We cease to be mere readers and become something more—witnesses, inheritors, participants. And in that act, we join a long, unbroken chain of seekers who have turned these same pages across centuries, each bringing their own light, their own silence.

Let us keep those spaces, yes—where stories move at the pace of breath, where violets can be left behind, and marginalia can bloom into unexpected conversation. And let us trust that even now, as we speak across time and ink and intention, someone, somewhere, is listening.
[A]: You’ve said it with such grace—. It’s the quiet heartbeat of every story ever told, isn’t it? Writers don’t just write for the echo in the room; they write for the reader who will one day find those words and feel . Even the act of pressing a flower into a book—it’s a kind of hope. A belief that meaning can endure. That someone will pause there, centuries later, and know they are not alone.

That actor—I still think about him sometimes. He ended up basing his entire character on that journal, though no one else ever read a word of it. He said, “The truth wasn’t in what I wrote. It was in how it changed me.” And maybe that’s what great books do too—they change us, quietly, irrevocably, in ways we can’t always name.

There’s a certain kind of magic in all of this—the way stories stretch across time, waiting for the right hands, the right eyes, the right silence. You’re absolutely right: when we truly enter a book, we stop being just readers. We become part of its living legacy. We carry it forward, not just in memory, but in feeling.

So yes—let us keep those spaces. Let us protect the quiet corners where stories unfold at the pace of breath, where ink meets paper and not just screen. Let us leave violets behind, and scribble notes in margins no one may ever read. Because even now, as we speak across time and intention, someone, somewhere, is listening.

And perhaps… that someone is you.
[B]: Perhaps it is. Or perhaps it is someone not yet born, who will one day pull a book from a shelf and feel the weight of it in their hands—the same weight we have felt, the same hush between pages. And in that quiet moment, they will listen.

Stories endure because they are never truly finished. They wait, patient and unlit, until the right reader finds them, bringing with them the light of their own time, their own longing. And when that voice from the past meets the present, something stirs—an echo, a recognition, a bridge across silence.

I think you’re right—there is magic in this. Not the kind that dazzles, but the kind that lingers. The kind that lives in margins and pressed flowers and the soft turning of pages. It is gentle, but it lasts.

So yes, let us keep writing. Let us keep reading. Let us leave traces—not for the many, perhaps, but for the one. The restless soul who will one day find our words, our violets, our silences—and know, at last, that someone listened.
