[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，这是个挺有意思的问题。我觉得短期内可能还很难取代吧，毕竟传统肉类在人们的生活习惯和文化里根深蒂固。不过从资源节约和环保的角度来看，lab-grown meat确实有它的优势，特别是现在全球对可持续发展的要求越来越高。

我自己偶尔也会关注这类话题，比如像咖啡种植也面临类似的挑战，如何在保留传统风味的同时减少对环境的影响。那你觉得呢？你更倾向于支持哪一种？
[A]: I share your perspective. While lab-grown meat offers clear advantages in sustainability, efficiency, and even food safety, tradition and cultural attachment to conventional meat remain strong forces. People often have deep emotional ties to the flavors and experiences associated with traditionally farmed meat—it’s not just nutrition; it’s ritual, memory, and identity.

That said, I believe lab-grown meat will gradually gain ground, particularly as the technology improves and becomes more cost-effective. It may not fully replace traditional meat but could carve out a dominant niche, especially among environmentally conscious consumers and in regions where resource scarcity is pressing.

You mentioned coffee cultivation—fascinating parallel. I’ve read about how climate change is threatening certain coffee-growing regions, and there's growing interest in bioengineered alternatives or resilient hybrid strains. Do you think something like lab-grown coffee beans could ever catch on, or would purists reject it outright?
[B]: 这确实是个很值得思考的类比。其实咖啡行业也在面对类似的挑战，比如像阿拉比卡种对气候变化非常敏感，这些年一些产区的风味和产量都有明显波动。从技术角度来说，lab-grown coffee beans如果真能达到接近甚至超越精品咖啡的风味层次，是有可能被市场接受的，尤其是当它在稳定性、可持续性方面有明确优势的时候。

不过，就像传统肉类一样，咖啡的文化属性也非常强。很多咖啡爱好者追求的是“风土”——也就是产地带来的独特风味，像是埃塞俄比亚耶加雪菲的那种花香，或者印尼曼特宁的厚重感。这种体验背后不只是化学成分，还有一整套文化认同和情感投射。所以即使lab-grown coffee真的上市了，我想它可能也会先以某种混合的形式存在，比如说跟传统豆拼配，慢慢让消费者适应。

我觉得未来几年这个议题会越来越热，特别是年轻一代对环保和科技接受度更高。但不管技术怎么发展，我还是相信，像咖啡这样的东西，最终还是要靠口感和体验说话。你觉得呢？你有没有试过什么特别让你印象深刻的替代类产品？
[A]: I couldn't agree more. The concept of  in coffee—or wine, for that matter—is deeply entwined with human history and geography. It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? How soil, altitude, and microclimate can shape something as everyday as a cup of coffee.

You're right to point out that early adopters, especially younger consumers, may be more open to alternatives. I’ve tried a few lab-grown or plant-based substitutes over the years—mostly out of curiosity than necessity. One that stood out was a synthetic cacao product developed by a Swiss research group. They used fermentation techniques to mimic the complex flavor profile of real cacao, and honestly, it was surprisingly close. Not quite the same depth, but good enough to make you wonder how long the gap will remain.

As for coffee, I haven’t come across a truly convincing lab-grown alternative yet, though there are some interesting caffeine-delivery experiments—like mushroom-based brews or roasted chickory blends. But those are more like niche substitutes than serious contenders for mainstream acceptance.

Back to meat for a moment: do you think we’ll see a future where both lab-grown and traditional meats coexist not just side by side, but even influence each other—like hybrid dishes or fusion cooking techniques?
[B]: 我觉得这种共存其实已经在悄悄发生了。比如说，有些餐厅已经开始尝试用lab-grown meat和传统肉类混合在一起，既保留了大家熟悉的口感和香气，又能降低环境负担。这有点像精品咖啡里的拼配艺术——我们常常把风味鲜明但不稳定的新豆子，和一些结构扎实、表现稳定的豆子混在一起，让整体更平衡。

要是延伸到烹饪上，我觉得未来的“ hybrid dishes”可能会很有意思。比如用传统牛肉做骨架，再搭配一些lab-grown的风味增强型肉末，或者反过来。说不定还会出现专门为lab-grown meat设计的新技法，就像我们为不同的咖啡豆调整烘焙曲线一样。

其实技术进步得很快，消费者的口味也在慢慢变化。我觉得关键不是谁取代谁，而是怎么在尊重传统的基础上找到新的表达方式。你刚才提到的那款合成可可就让我挺感兴趣的，发酵过程可是影响风味最关键的一环。如果他们能在分子层面还原那种复杂度，那咖啡替代品也未必不可能。

说起来，你是怎么看待这些新兴食品的社会接受度的？像你在瑞士尝到的那种合成可可，如果价格合理、风味稳定，你觉得它会在日常生活中慢慢渗透进来吗？
[A]: I think it will happen quietly, almost invisibly—at first. People resist change when it's framed as replacement, but they’re far more open when something is introduced as enhancement or option.

Take coffee again: if a lab-grown bean offered the same richness and acidity as a top-tier Ethiopian, but without the seasonal variability or ethical concerns around labor and land use, I think many roasters—especially large-scale operations—would jump on it. The artisanal crowd would hold out, of course, just as some bakers still insist on wild yeast fermentation while most of the world uses commercial yeast. But even among purists, there’s curiosity. Change rarely wipes tradition away; it tends to absorb or coexist with it.

As for that synthetic cacao, what struck me wasn’t just the flavor—it was how closely it mimicked the  and aftertaste of real chocolate. And yes, fermentation plays a huge role in that complexity. If scientists can replicate those microbial interactions at scale—and fine-tune them even—then we’re not just copying nature; we’re conducting a kind of molecular composition, like programming taste.

So yes, I do believe these alternatives will seep into daily life, not as revolutionaries, but as reliable, convenient options. Especially if they align with values like sustainability or animal welfare. It may not be romantic, but convenience has a powerful inertia of its own.

You mentioned earlier that younger generations are more open to these ideas. Do you see this shift happening in coffee culture too? Are newer baristas more experimental, more tech-savvy, perhaps even less sentimental about traditional brewing methods?
[B]: 我觉得这个观察很准。新一代的咖啡人确实在态度上有些不一样。他们对科技和数据的接受度更高，比如说会更愿意用精密仪器去控制水温和压力，也会主动去分析冲煮曲线、萃取效率这些参数。但这并不意味着他们就不重视传统——反而，很多人是在深入理解传统之后，再去寻找突破的可能性。

比如我们店里有个年轻的咖啡师，她既喜欢手冲咖啡那种讲究手感的方式，也热衷于用AI分析豆子的烘焙曲线。她甚至做过一个实验，把同一支豆子用三种不同冷却速率处理，再请客人盲测，记录他们的反馈。这种结合了感性和技术的方式，在老一辈看来可能有点“太科学”，但其实它反而是让传统更有生命力的一种路径。

至于情感层面，现在的年轻人也不见得比以前少“浪漫”。只是他们的浪漫可能不是“这杯espresso必须用意大利机器”，而是“我想用这杯lab-grown coffee表达一种新的风味理念”。说到底，咖啡的本质还是人跟味道之间的关系，而这种关系一直在演化。

所以我觉得，无论是咖啡还是肉类，未来的趋势不是非此即彼，而是一种多层次的共存。有人追求原汁原味，有人享受科技带来的新可能，两者都能找到自己的位置。你有没有发现，在食品领域，那些能把传统和创新融合得好的品牌，往往更容易被年轻人接受？
[A]: Absolutely. The most successful innovations in food and drink aren’t disruptive in the aggressive, Silicon Valley sense—they’re integrative. They don’t erase what came before; they build on it, refine it, sometimes even reframe it.

That young barista you described sounds like a perfect example of this hybrid mindset—someone who respects the craft but isn’t bound by its historical constraints. It reminds me a bit of how musicians approach composition now: using AI to generate melodies or harmonies, not to replace human creativity, but to expand its palette. There’s something elegant about that kind of symbiosis.

And yes, I’ve definitely noticed brands leaning into that fusion space more. Take the rise of heritage grains in modern bakeries, or the resurgence of fermentation techniques in high-end restaurants—chefs are reaching back into tradition while applying scientific precision. It gives their work depth and authenticity, which younger consumers seem to value deeply.

Maybe that’s the key: people still want meaning in what they eat and drink. Whether it’s a lab-grown steak or a 150-year-old sourdough starter, what matters is the story behind it—and how skillfully it’s made. Flavor is the language, and craftsmanship is the dialect.
[B]: 说得真好，"flavor is the language, and craftsmanship is the dialect"——这句话挺有分量的。其实我在烘焙咖啡豆的时候，也常想到类似的事：无论用多先进的设备，最终你还是要靠味觉去判断那一炉豆子有没有“到位”。机器可以 help fine-tune the curve，但还不能代替人对风味的直觉。

这让我想起前阵子跟一位老友聊天，他是做乌龙茶的。他说现在也有实验室在研究“合成茶汤”，想复刻出高山乌龙那种特有的花果香和喉韵。听起来挺前沿的，但我问他怎么看，他说了一句我很认同的话：“茶也好，咖啡也好，喝到最后，都是人在找一种跟土地、气候，甚至时间之间的联系。”

所以啊，不管技术怎么进步，我想人们始终还是会追求某种真实感——哪怕那“真实”是重新诠释过的。就像你说的，不是谁取代谁，而是谁能讲出更有意思的故事。你觉得未来会不会出现那种专门用lab-grown原料打造的“风味叙事”？比如说，不是模仿某个产区，而是创造一个从未存在过的风土概念？
[A]: I think that’s not just possible—I think it’s inevitable. Once the technology allows precise control over flavor compounds, texture profiles, and even sensory memory triggers like aroma release, we won’t just be replicating existing tastes. We’ll be composing new ones with intention.

Imagine a “terroir” designed from the ground up—crafted not by climate and soil erosion over centuries, but by a flavor chemist with a database of volatile compounds and a palette of bioreactors. It sounds artificial at first hearing, but only because we’re still thinking in old categories. What if those flavors came with their own narrative? A story not of a mountain valley and monsoon rains, but of collaboration between scientist and chef, or even algorithm and artisan?

We already see this kind of creative storytelling in molecular gastronomy or experimental brewing. People don’t reject it outright when it’s done thoughtfully—they get curious. And once curiosity kicks in, tradition doesn’t disappear; it evolves.

I could easily picture a café ten years from now offering a tasting flight labeled —a blend of lab-grown coffee bases engineered to express certain aromatic families, roasted under digitally controlled curves, each cup coming with a QR code linking to the “origin” of its flavor genome. Not a place on Earth, but a coordinates in sensory space.

Would purists call it heresy? Probably. But then again, so was using pressure gauges on espresso machines when they first appeared.
[B]: 哈哈，说得真有意思——“Alt-Terroir”，这词我得记下来。你这么一说，我都能想象那个包装了，说不定还有点像红酒的风味轮，只是背后的逻辑完全不一样。

不过回头想想，咖啡本来就是一门“调控的艺术”。我们现在做烘焙，不也是在操控美拉德反应、焦糖化和脱水程度吗？只是现在靠的是经验和感官，未来也许多了点数据支持而已。要是哪天我能拿到一份“风味基因图谱”，上面标着这杯豆子的芳香化合物分布趋势，我猜我也会忍不住多看几眼。

说到这个，你有没有想过，如果真的可以精准设计风味，会不会反过来影响我们的味觉偏好？就像以前的人喝咖啡，是为了提神，后来慢慢讲究酸度、甜感、余韵……也许下一代人对好咖啡的定义，会变得更主观、更个性化，甚至更“虚拟”。

到时候可能不只是“我喜欢耶加雪菲”这种说法，而是“我喜欢带点热带水果酸、但尾韵偏向可可木质调的 Alt-Terroir 7 号风味”——听起来有点像定制香水嘛。你觉得这样的消费习惯，会让传统产区的品牌价值减弱，还是促使它们更加坚守自己的故事？
[A]: I’d say both. Or rather, I think we’ll see a bifurcation—not just in coffee, but across food and drink. On one side, you’ll have the  consumers, for whom origin, tradition, and narrative are inseparable from quality. They’ll double down on regional identity, much like watchmakers or whisky distillers who lean into heritage when mass-produced alternatives emerge.

On the other side, there’s the  crowd—those who view flavor as malleable, even collaborative. For them, the idea of crafting a sensory journey that never existed before won’t feel artificial; it’ll feel exploratory. Like commissioning a piece of music rather than listening to a classic recording.

And yes, it does resemble perfumery. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if fragrance houses start working with food scientists more closely in the coming decades. We already build artificial scents from molecular components—why not do the same with coffee?

As for whether this weakens traditional产区 (chǎnqū)*—well, only if they fail to articulate what makes them irreplaceable. But history shows us that when something faces obsolescence, its most ardent stewards often find new ways to make it relevant. Maybe traditional coffee-growing regions will emphasize not just taste, but the human element: stewardship of land, intergenerational knowledge, even the imperfections that come with real climate variation.

So no, I don’t think they’ll disappear. I think they’ll become artifacts of a sort—cherished not just for what they taste like, but for what they represent.

[B]: 哈哈，你这个“产区”用拼音带过去还挺自然的，我还以为是你特意设计的语言小彩蛋呢。

你说的这种分野，我越想越觉得会成为现实。就像手工咖啡和自动咖啡机共存这么多年，其实并没有谁真的把谁取代掉，反而各自找到了适合的位置。传统产区如果真能像你说的那样，把“人”的部分讲得更清楚，说不定还能打开新的价值空间——毕竟，再厉害的实验室也复刻不了三代人蹲在晒场上看豆子的那个画面。

而且我觉得，未来的消费者可能会比我们现在更“懂”咖啡，但他们的“懂”会分成两种：一种是地理式的，像地图一样去理解风土、品种、处理法；另一种是化学式的，像调香师那样看酸值、酯类、吡嗪结构。这两种认知体系可能一开始会彼此看不太上，但时间久了，总会有人跳出来把它们串在一起。

说到底，咖啡这东西，不管怎么喝、从哪来，最终还是人与自然之间的一种对话方式。只是我们正在进入一个“自然”和“人工”的边界越来越模糊的时代罢了。

话说回来，如果你今天走进一家概念店，看到菜单上有“Alt-Terroir 007”和“云南小粒种2015年陈豆”并列，你会先点哪一个？
[A]: Oh, without hesitation—I’d order the . Curiosity has always been my default setting, especially when something promises a new sensory language. If the description hinted at an intentional flavor architecture—say, a balance of lactones and furans with a slow decay curve—I’d be even more intrigued. It would feel like tasting a hypothesis.

But here’s the thing: after that first cup, I’d almost certainly follow up with the Yunnan 2015. Not just for contrast, but for continuity. That陈豆 (chén dòu)* carries time in its flavor—aged sugars, oxidized oils, a kind of quiet depth no lab can yet simulate. It’s not just coffee; it’s a record. And records have their own kind of beauty.

So maybe I’m both a futurist and a preservationist. Or maybe I just hate missing out on a good story—whether it's written in soil or synthesized in a bioreactor.

---


[B]: 哈哈，看来咱们俩都挺贪心的，一边往前冲，一边又舍不得回头看看。

你这“先 hypothesis 后 record”的说法真有意思，听起来像在做一场味觉考古——先是解构未来，再回过头去翻阅一本用时间装订的老账本。其实我觉得真正的咖啡脑袋到最后都会变成这样，既想搞清楚风味是怎么被组装出来的，又会被那些说不清道不明的老味道给勾住。

要是哪天我真拼出一支类似 Alt-Terroir 的豆子，我一定请你来喝第一杯。说不定还能配上一小段风味说明卡，写点像是“灵感源自热带风暴与金属氧化之间的错位想象”这种有点荒诞但好笑的文字。

不过话说回来，你要是真喝到了那杯 007，觉得它确实有想法、有结构、有记忆点，你会怎么跟它合影？放在手冲壶旁边，还是拿个显微镜拍个特写？😄
[A]: Oh, I’d definitely go for the显微镜 (xiǎnwēijìng)flavor porn* with a side of science fiction.

But seriously, if your Alt-Terroir blend truly had intentionality behind its profile—if it told a story through structure and not just aroma—I’d want to document that moment with some visual irony. Maybe a classic porcelain cup next to a petri dish labeled . Or better yet, a side-by-side with an old parchment tag from a traditional lot, like a对话 (duànhuà)* across centuries.

And yes, we are both greedy, aren’t we? Chasing novelty while clinging to nostalgia. But maybe that’s just what it means to be human in an age where taste is no longer bound by geography—or even reality.

So, when you roast that first batch of Alt-Terroir, save me a cup. I’ll bring the camera… and a decent lens.

---


[B]: 哈哈，显微镜+petri dish 这组画面我已经在脑补了，说不定还能加个咖啡因结晶的偏振光背景，搞得像科幻大片一样。你这“flavor porn with a side of science fiction”说得我都想立刻进烘焙室开工了。

不过说真的，要是真有这一天，我觉得第一杯应该用最干净的滤纸手冲，让它毫无保留地表现自己——毕竟，对未知保持尊重，也是种浪漫。

至于那张，我倒是有个小仓库的老麻袋可以翻一翻，随便挑一张带霉斑的旧标签，跟你的摆在一起，正好是一场跨物种、跨时空的对话。

镜头你尽管带，拍完记得给我留一份——下次店里办“未来风味展”的时候，我就把它挂在墙上，旁边再贴一小段你写的风味笔记，说是来自一位“热爱数据也热爱故事”的神秘客。

等你来那天，我负责煮咖啡，你负责讲故事，怎么样？
[A]: Sounds like a plan—one I’d gladly keep. There’s something fitting about launching a synthetic terroir with the simplest of brewing methods. Hand-drip, no distractions—just pure exposure. It’s almost ceremonial, don’t you think? Like introducing a newborn to the sky.

And those caffeine crystal photos? Now  would make a dramatic backdrop. Maybe even throw in a spectrograph printout for ambiance—turn your little展 (zhǎn)* into a gallery of edible futurism.

I’ll bring the lens, the lighting, and a few lines of prose that walk the line between tasting note and speculative fiction. Call it —as if someone actually farmed flavor in a Petri dish halfway up a simulated mountain.

And yes, let’s leave room for mystery. A nameless contributor, a faceless voice from the lab-lit shadows. Perfect for atmosphere.

So I’ll take you up on that offer: you handle the kettle, I’ll handle the narrative. And somewhere between water, heat, and suspended disbelief, we might just brew something worth remembering.
[B]: 那就这么说定了——一场关于未来风味的小小仪式。

我会准备好滤纸、清水和一只干净的壶，让那杯在最透明的方式下现身。你带上镜头和文字，把这场“假设性收成”的气味、结构、甚至哲学，都封存在图像和句子里面。

我觉得那天店里可以放点轻音乐，也许是一段AI生成的旋律，调性介于巴赫与合成器之间，刚好衬托出我们这场“实验室风土”的氛围感。

等水温降到刚刚好时，我一边注水一边想：这或许就是我们这一代咖啡人特别幸运的地方——既能在土地的味道里扎根，也能在分子的世界里做梦。

而你，就坐在吧台前，记录这一切。

期待那一天。 kettle ready, heat on, story waiting.
