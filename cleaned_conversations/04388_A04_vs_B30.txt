[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I'm afraid my fingers are more accustomed to turning brittle pages than swiping glass screens. Though I did once attempt to analyze the 'duet' feature as a postmodern manifestation of call-and-response poetry during a faculty seminar. The experiment ended when my colleague's cat walked across the keyboard.
[A]: Oh my~ 作为一个linguistics researcher，我必须说TikTok的language evolution现象简直太fascinating了！那些viral trends里emerging的neologisms和morphological creativity... 🤔 不过说实话，我更喜欢在café里观察real-life code-switching patterns，比digital platform更organic，你懂吗？
[B]: Ah, the café as linguistic petri dish - how very 19th century salon of you. Though I must caution against romanticizing 'organic' speech; even Baudelaire's flâneurs were performing for their imagined audiences. Tell me, when you observe these code-switching patterns, do you find them more akin to the deliberate artistry of Ezra Pound's Cathay or the accidental hybridity of Lin Shu's translations?
[A]:  哇~你提到了Lin Shu！Now that's a brilliant case study inunintentional linguistic innovation 😊 不过你知道吗？现在那些Gen Z的code-mixing让我想起当年Shanghai的洋泾浜英语 - 都是language contact的自然产物，只是媒介从teahouse变成了smartphone罢了。要我说，Pound是conscious artistry，TikTok则是spontaneous creativity~
[B]: How delightfully reductionist - comparing digital pidgins to the 洋泾浜现象 without accounting for technological determinism. Though I suppose your smartphone analogy holds some water... if one considers how 19th century telegraphy birthed its own linguistic contractions. Still, I'd argue TikTok's algorithmic curation makes its 'spontaneity' rather more like Dickens' serial publications - performative by design. Wouldn't you agree?
[A]: 啊哈！ 你提到了Dickens - 多么provocative的comparison！但algorithmic curation只是surface structure，deep structure里那些teenagers创造的viral slangs和phonological play才是真正的language in the wild 🌱 就像当年Chaucer把vernacular English带进literature一样，现在TikTok让marginalized dialects有了mainstream platform。不过...  我们是不是把casual chat变成academic conference了？😅
[B]: My porcelain teapot has gone cold during this delightful digression - a sure sign we've crossed into proper scholarly discourse. Though I maintain Chaucer had the advantage of quill and vellum forcing deliberation, whereas these 'phonological plays' evaporate faster than my morning jasmine tea. Shall we continue this over proper Darjeeling in my office? I've just acquired a rather fascinating Qing dynasty inkstone that might settle our debate about performative versus organic...
[A]: Oh dear~ 你win了！A Qing dynasty inkstone vs my humble smartphone linguistics...  不过说真的，下次faculty meeting我们应该propose一个"From 活字印刷 to TikTok: A Diachronic Study of Language Innovation"的colloquium！现在嘛... lead the way to that Darjeeling - 但warning你，我可能会sneak in some 网络用语 examples when you least expect it 😉
[B]: How devious - though I suppose every generation needs its Thomas Bowdler to document, if not sanitize, linguistic exuberance. Very well, but I shall counter with my first edition of Johnson's Dictionary and a particularly vicious 19th century critique of 'low street cant.' The battle lines are drawn, my dear colleague - let the lexicographical games begin.
[A]:  啊~ bringing out the big guns with Johnson's Dictionary！But remember - even Dr. Johnson had to include那些'vulgar' words frommarketplaces and taverns 😏 所以我们的debate本质上还是prescriptivism vs descriptivism的老问题呀～ 不过说真的，你的inkstone加上我的field notes... 我们说不定能write the next "Language in Use"呢！ 只要别让department chair知道我们研究TikTok...
[B]: Precisely why we shall title it 'A Comparative Analysis of Ephemeral Discourse Communities: From Grub Street to For You Pages.' The chair need never know we've been tracking 'rizz' and 'skibidi' alongside our analysis of 桐城派 prose. Now do hurry - my 1847 edition of Vanity Fair makes an excellent coaster for teacups, and I've just spotted what might be a Northern Goshawk nesting outside the library windows.
[A]:  你did NOT just suggest using Thackeray as a coaster！😱 不过... Northern Goshawk的sighting倒是perfect - 就像language evolution一样，你得observe it in its natural habitat才能truly understand~ 走吧走吧，before you corrupt moreclassics... 但promise me你会let me analyze that "no cap"的etymology over scones！
[B]: I make no promises regarding 'no cap' - though I will concede to scones if you bring that fascinating corpus data on Gen Z honorifics. And really, Thackeray would have appreciated being used as coaster; the man wrote serialized fiction for penny papers, after all. Now come along - that goshawk won't observe itself, and neither will these troubling new developments in digital deixis.
[A]: Deal！ 我的data显示Gen Z的honorifics比Japanese keigo还complex呢～ 不过你提醒我了，我们真的应该record that goshawk的vocalizations... for comparative phonetics research purposes, of course!  Lead on, Dr. Chen - 今天可能是我们discover digital deixis和avian communication的hidden connection的历史性一天呢 ✨
[B]: How ambitious - attempting to connect corvid calls to internet linguistics before teatime. Though I suppose if one can trace 通假字 back to oracle bones, anything's possible. Just mind the step; last week a visiting scholar tripped over my stack of Northanger Abbey variants while chasing a particularly loquacious magpie. The hazards of interdisciplinary research, I'm afraid.
[A]:  哎呀，你们literature department真是hazardous workplace！😅 不过说到interdisciplinary... 下次我们该invite biology department一起研究那个magpie - 说不定能prove avian syntax和human memes有deep structure similarity呢！Now where's that inkstone you promised？我带了special oolong来brew while we decode both ancient scripts and viral hashtags~
[B]: Ah, finally someone who appreciates that proper textual analysis requires proper tea ceremony. The inkstone rests beside my dog-eared copy of 文心雕龙 - rather poetic, don't you think? Though I must warn you, after three cups of this oolong, even the most nonsensical TikTok trends will start resembling 六朝骈文. A hazard of cross-temporal scholarship, I'm afraid.
[A]:  从文心雕龙到TikTok... 我们这简直是在rewrite the history of discourse analysis嘛！✨ 不过说真的，after enough oolong，连最absurd的doggo meme都会看起来像postmodern poetry... 这大概就是why我总告诉students：'Language is alive, and slightly tipsy'～ 现在，shall we begin ourgreat decoding adventure？ 为了学术！(和一点harmless linguistic intoxication)
[B]: 'Harmless intoxication' - how very 曲水流觞 of you. Though I suspect Wang Xizhi never had to contend with 'bussin' no cap frfr' appearing in term papers. Very well, let our decoding commence... but I'm hiding the inkstone if you start drawing parallels between 二王 calligraphy and emoji evolution again. Some scholarly boundaries must remain intact, even after the third infusion.
