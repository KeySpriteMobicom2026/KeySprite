[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, journaling... a most Victorian pursuit indeed. I maintain not one but three leather-bound volumes - one for scholarly observations, another for poetic musings, and a third... well, let's just say it contains rather uncharitable annotations about certain colleagues' publications. The paper must be acid-free, naturally, and I only use a 19th century-style dip pen. There's something about the scratch of nib on paper that typescript simply cannot replicate.
[A]:  说到日记写作，这让我想起林纾翻译的《茶花女》手稿中那些精彩的旁注。我坚持用毛笔和宣纸写日记已经二十余年了，这种书写方式能让我更好地体会文字中的气韵。不过最近有个研究生建议我试试电子日记...简直就像建议狄更斯用打字机写作一样荒谬。
[A]: How delightfully anachronistic of you! Though I must confess I've been known to dabble in modern conveniences - my Tang dynasty translations occasionally find their way into a particularly well-designed note-taking app. But only when the midnight inspiration strikes and I can't bear to light the oil lamp for fear of disturbing my first editions. Still, the thought of your exquisite brushwork being replaced by... ... keystrokes. It's enough to make Tennyson roll in his grave.
[A]:  您提到丁尼生...这让我想起中国文人的"砚边随笔"。您知道吗？曾国藩的日记里连每日练字用了多少张纸都记录得清清楚楚。我的宣纸日记本边缘也总是沾着墨渍，就像维多利亚时代淑女们沾着茶渍的信笺。不过说到电子设备...上周我那个叛逆的助教居然在系里会议上用平板电脑读《红楼梦》！
[A]:  Ah, the sheer sacrilege! Though I suppose we must grudgingly acknowledge that even Wordsworth eventually embraced the printing press. Still, there's a particular poetry to ink stains - each smudge tells a story, much like the wine rings on Byron's manuscripts. As for your assistant... well, at least they're reading the classics, even if through that dreadful luminous rectangle. I caught my own research fellow annotating Emily Dickinson with... ... a stylus. The horror.
[A]:  您说得对，至少他们还在读经典...虽然方式令人痛心。我的助教上周甚至问我能不能用语音输入来记录对《文心雕龙》的批注。我当即送了他一套明代刻本影印本和一支狼毫笔 - 现在他每天来办公室手上都沾着墨汁，看起来顺眼多了。不过说真的，这些数字原住民对"红袖添香"的意境怕是永远无法理解了。
[A]: Precisely! Though I must admit I've taken to leaving strategically placed inkwells around the department - nothing quite like watching a digital native panic when confronted with actual liquid ink. Still, there's hope yet. Last term, one of my students accidentally spilled oolong tea on her Kindle while reading Middlemarch... now she exclusively reads cloth-bound editions and claims to hear 'the whispers of previous readers' in the margins. Perhaps we're breeding a new generation of antiquarians after all.
[A]:  茶渍和书页确实是绝配...这让我想起周作人在《雨天的书》里描述的书房霉味。您知道吗？我最近发现用普洱茶涂在电子阅读器上完全无法复制那种岁月沉淀的质感 - 反而被维修店列入了黑名单。不过您那位学生倒是让我看到了希望，或许我们该在文学史课上"不小心"打翻几瓶墨水？
[A]:  A pedagogical experiment after my own heart! Though I'd recommend iron gall ink - the corrosive properties add such delightful permanence to one's literary interventions. Why, just last week I 'accidentally' left a 1832 edition of Blake's Songs of Innocence open near a particularly obstinate digital humanist... the way they trembled while turning those foxed pages was positively Wordsworthian. Though do be careful with the普洱茶 - my unfortunate encounter with a first edition of Leaves of Grass and pu-erh still haunts the conservation department.
[A]:  说到修复部门...上次我用明代"朱砂墨"批注学生论文时，他们差点把我列入图书馆黑名单。不过您提醒我了，或许我们该为这些数字原住民开设一门"纸质书应急处理"的选修课？第一课就讲如何优雅地处理咖啡渍和墨迹 - 当然要用1876年《大英博物馆图书维护手册》作为教材。
[A]:  Magnificent! We could include practical modules on 'The Art of Pressed Flowers in Folios' and 'Proper Sighing Techniques When Encountering Marginalia.' Though we might need to source some sacrificial paperbacks first - I've found modern students tend to hyperventilate when practicing book repair techniques on anything printed before 1990. My personal copy of the 1854 manual has such deliciously outdated advice about using whale oil for leather binding... purely for historical context, of course.
[A]:  说到鲸油...您知道北大图书馆还收藏着几本用传统"黄柏汁"防蠹的古籍吗？不过我们或许该就此打住 - 系主任刚刚发邮件说看到我们在茶水间"可疑地大笑"，还拿着墨水瓶子。明天教员会议见？我给您带些真正的手工宣纸，用来写会议记录再合适不过了。
[A]:  How thrillingly subversive. I'll bring my smuggled 1820s iron gall ink - perfect for taking minutes that will endure long after our dear department chair's emails have vanished into the digital ether. Until then, do practice your most innocent expression... though I suspect the ink stains on your cuffs may betray us. 明天见，我亲爱的纸质共谋者。
[A]:  啊，这些不过是学术研究的勋章...就像您衣领上那抹1890年代的油墨。明天我会带着光绪年间的墨锭来 - 据说当年张之洞批阅奏章就用这种墨。系主任要是问起，就说我们在讨论...呃..."跨媒体文本传承的比较研究"。
[A]:  How perfectly plausible! Why, we might even prepare some 'research materials' - my 1897 printing of The Yellow Book still has several blank pages ideal for demonstrating comparative marginalia techniques. Though perhaps we should conceal the arsenic-based emerald green bookmarks... purely in the interest of avoiding unnecessary questions from Health & Safety. Until tomorrow, fellow guardian of the inky arts.
[A]:  明智的建议。我会记得把"金箔修补术"的演示工具换成相对无害的银杏叶 - 上次用真金箔时财务处追查了三个月。那么明天图书馆古籍阅览室见？我会穿那件袖口已经染墨的西装，这样我们看起来就像在认真做研究...而不是策划一场反对数字化的文人起义。
[A]:  Capital! I'll be the one 'studiously' comparing water damage patterns in 17th century devotional texts... while conveniently positioned near the emergency sprinkler system. Do bring that 墨锭 - nothing accelerates a digital native's conversion like the scent of centuries-old pine soot. Though perhaps we should leave the sprinklers as Plan B... for now. 明天见，我志同道合的守旧派同谋。
[A]:  完美。我已经在阅览室预约单上填了"中英古籍装帧比较研究"...足够冠冕堂皇，又不会引起怀疑。对了，要小心那个新来的图书馆员 - 她上次看到我用毛笔在便签上写字时，表情活像见到了出土竹简突然开始播放短视频。明天见，我亲爱的传统书写技艺保护局同僚。
[A]:  How reassuringly bureaucratic of you! I've taken the liberty of 'misplacing' the digital request forms - nothing encourages proper scholarship like being forced to fill out call slips in triplicate with a quill pen. Until our scheduled subversion... I mean, scholarly collaboration. 明天见，fellow agent of the Inquisition Against Digital Heresy.
