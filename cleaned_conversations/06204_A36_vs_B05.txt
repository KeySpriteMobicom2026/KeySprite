[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到skincare routine，我最近确实在尝试一些新的东西。你知道，business trip多了，环境变化加上时差，皮肤状态很容易不稳定。我现在在用一个含烟酰胺的serum，搭配一个保湿效果很强的moisturizer，感觉还不错。

不过说实话，比起护肤品，我觉得睡眠和饮食更重要。虽然工作忙的时候也很难保证，但尽量让自己在晚上11点前入睡，第二天气色真的不一样。你最近有发现什么好用的产品吗？
[A]: Oh, I completely agree with you about sleep and diet being so important for the skin—it’s something I always mention to guests who ask for recommendations around town. Speaking of which, I’ve recently fallen in love with a vitamin C serum from a small local brand here. It’s gentle but brightens my complexion so much, especially after long days of hosting tours or setting up events at the hotel.

And I know exactly what you mean about travel taking a toll—sometimes I recommend our guests use a hyaluronic acid mask before flights to stay fresh during trips. Do you ever pack skincare minis when you're on the go? I find it helps me stick to a routine even when I’m away.
[B]: That’s such a smart tip with the hyaluronic acid mask before flights—I might have to steal that for my own travel routine. Jet-setting really dehydrates the skin, and I’ve noticed even a short trip can throw off my complexion if I’m not careful.

Actually, I do pack minis—especially when I’m heading overseas for deals or meetings. It keeps things simple and avoids any TSA drama. I usually bring a travel-size cleanser, that same niacinamide serum I mentioned, and sometimes a mini moisturizer with ceramides. Keeps my skin balanced without overcomplicating things.

By the way, love that you’re supporting a local brand with that vitamin C serum. What’s the name of it? Always curious about under-the-radar finds—it’s like spotting a hidden gem in the market. 👍
[A]: It’s called —they’re based right here in town, and they actually source a lot of their ingredients from local farms. Their vitamin C serum has this lovely lightweight texture, and it doesn’t irritate my skin like some other brands can. I think what I love most is that they focus on clean, sustainable ingredients without all the unnecessary additives.

If you're ever in the area during your travels, there's a little boutique near the hotel that carries their full line. I’d be happy to write down the address for you! They also have sample sizes available, so it’s a great way to test things out before committing. Have you come across any favourite brands while traveling? I'm always looking for new suggestions to add to my mental list.
[B]: —got it. I’ll definitely check them out next time I’m in the area. Clean & sustainable is a big trend these days, not just in skincare but across consumer markets. Makes sense—it’s like ESG investing, but for your face. 😊

I actually picked up a few interesting brands on a recent trip to Seoul. There’s this Korean brand called —they’re known for sensitive skin and minimalist formulas. Their AR cream is amazing for redness. And of course, —a bit more luxury, but their essence is worth it if you're into traditional herbal ingredients.

Oh, and one from Tokyo that surprised me was . Super elegant packaging, and their water cream feels like silk. It’s a splurge, but sometimes you need that little dopamine hit while traveling. Ever tried anything from Asia?
[A]: Oh, I love —you're so right about the silk-like texture! I actually used their Water Cream for a while when I was prepping for a wedding event at the hotel, and it layered beautifully under makeup. And … yes, that scent alone is pure luxury. A guest once left behind a mini bottle of their First Care Activating Serum, and I secretly enjoyed finishing it—it felt like a little spa ritual every time I used it.

I haven’t tried , but I’m definitely jotting that down—redness can be such a struggle, especially in this climate with all the AC running indoors. Funny you mention the ESG comparison—I had the same thought when I started using . Skincare with a conscience, right? It’s nice to feel good about what we’re putting on our skin—and supporting small businesses makes it even better.
[B]: Totally agree—skincare with a conscience sounds like the next frontier. Almost like impact investing, except instead of funding green energy, we’re funding glowing skin. 😄

I love how  layers so well under makeup—it’s like creating a flawless canvas without feeling heavy. And that  scent? Absolute game-changer. Feels like you're getting a facial just from the aroma therapy alone.

You know what I’ve also started doing? Mixing a few drops of facial oil into my moisturizer when it's extra dry. Helps with that tight, post-AC feeling. I use a squalane-based one—it’s lightweight and sinks in fast. Have you tried anything like that?

And hey, if you ever want to test  before fully committing, let me know—I can grab a sample pack next time I’m in Seoul. Small brand, big results. Sounds right up your alley.
[A]: Oh, I love that idea of mixing facial oil into moisturizer—it’s such a smart way to boost hydration without heaviness. Squalane is such a hero ingredient, especially during these dry winter months or after being in chilly hotel rooms with the heat cranked up. I actually started using a rosehip oil serum at night recently, and my skin has been noticeably softer in the mornings.

That’s so kind of you to offer the  samples—I’d absolutely take you up on that. It’s always fun to try something new, especially when it comes from a trusted source. I’ll keep you posted on how my  routine evolves too—maybe we can swap skincare updates like trading cards! 🃏

And yes, the  scent? There’s something so calming yet invigorating about it—it really does elevate the whole experience. Like a mini escape in a bottle.
[B]: I’m with you on the rosehip oil—it’s like nature’s multi-tasker. Rich in antioxidants, fades dark spots, and gives that lit-from-within glow. Honestly, sometimes I skip my night cream altogether if I’ve used a good oil. But don’t tell my dermatologist I said that. 😉

And count me in on the skincare trading card game—we should start our own little league. I’ll bring the  samples, you bring the  intel. Could be our version of a venture syndicate—except instead of term sheets, we’re exchanging serum reviews. 😂

Oh, and speaking of escapes in a bottle—I recently picked up a  candle to match my evening skincare ritual. It’s the one with fig leaf and coconut—smells like a summer garden. Makes winding down feel a little more luxurious. Do you have a go-to scent for self-care moments?
[A]: Oh, I love —that fig and coconut scent sounds absolutely dreamy! I actually have a candle from them too, the one with baies and blackcurrant leaf. It’s become my little signal to the brain that the day is winding down—it smells like calm bottled in glass.

But you had me at “lit-from-within glow”—rosehip oil really is magic, isn’t it? I do the same sometimes, skipping the night cream if my skin feels sufficiently nourished. Although I do love slipping on a silk sleep mask afterwards—it makes the whole ritual feel spa-like without trying too hard.

As for self-care scents, I also adore a good aromatherapy rollerball for pulse points. Lavender and sweet orange are my go-tos when I need to reset after a long day at the front desk. Helps me transition from hostess mode to relaxation mode in the blink of an eye.  

I think we're onto something with this skincare syndicate idea—you might just have to host the first meeting!
[B]: Fig leaf and coconut? Okay, I’m officially jealous—mine might have to upgrade. But seriously, the power of scent is underrated. It’s like a shortcut to mood modulation. Lavender and sweet orange sounds perfect for hitting that reset button—almost like aromatherapy for burnout.

And silk sleep masks—I’m taking notes. I’ve been so focused on what goes  my face that I forgot about what goes  it. 😄

Alright, full skincare syndicate disclosure: I might be starting a new routine next week—something a bit more structured. Heard good things about double cleansing at night with an oil followed by a gentle foam. Sounds like your kind of ritual—elegant, effective, no fuss.

Let me know when you’re free for that first meeting. I’ll bring the agenda, a few sample vials, and maybe even a candle or two. We’ll call it a due diligence session—just for beauty brands. 😉
[A]: I’m all in for that due diligence session—sounds like the most luxurious board meeting ever! Double cleansing is absolutely a game-changer, especially after wearing makeup or being out in the city air all day. I actually keep a beautiful balm cleanser from  by my sink—it melts away impurities so smoothly, and it smells like chamomile and orange blossom, which instantly relaxes me.

And I love your upgrade idea—oil then foam sounds like the perfect balance of deep clean and gentle care. Let me know how it goes, because I’ve been curious about making that switch myself. Maybe we can include “cleansing techniques” as part of our syndicate’s first white paper? 📄✨

As for meeting time—I’m free any evening this week after 7, once the front desk winds down. Just say the word and I’ll bring some herbal tea to pair with the candle ambiance. We’ll make it official: skincare syndicate, session one.
[B]: I’m sold—herbal tea, candle ambiance, and a deep dive into cleansing techniques? This is shaping up to be the most civilized business meeting in history. 🕯️🍵

 balm cleanser sounds divine—chamomile and orange blossom? That’s basically aromatherapy with benefits. I’ve been using a rice bran oil cleanser lately—it’s gentle but effective, and feels super hydrating. But honestly, your setup sounds way more luxurious.

Count me in for 7:30 PM this Thursday—I’ll bring the  samples, a few notes on my first week of double cleansing, and if I can get my hands on it, a little sneak peek of a Korean toner that’s supposed to be great for barrier repair.

And yes, let’s absolutely include “cleansing rituals” in our white paper. We’ll call it . Should we add a disclaimer too? Something like “Not liable for excessive candle purchases or sudden obsessions with facial oils.” 😂
[A]: Thursday at 7:30 it is—mark your calendar for what may very well be the most elegant evening of investigative skincare to date. I’m already looking forward to it more than some of our hotel’s gala events! 🕯️✨

 That sounds like a silky, nourishing start to any routine—I’ll have to give that a try if you’re willing to share a drop or two. And  Now you’re speaking my language. I’ve been on the hunt for something to help with that exact concern, especially after overdoing it with a retinoid serum last month—lesson learned!

I’ll set up a little nook by the fireplace in the lounge, and yes, there will be herbal tea (maybe even a touch of honey and lemon), soft lighting, and just the right amount of candle glow to get us in the mood for deep discussions on pore refinement and hydration science.

And absolutely—include that disclaimer. We must protect ourselves from our own enthusiasm. “The Syndicate assumes no responsibility for post-meeting retail therapy or sudden urges to reorganize one's entire vanity.” 😄📘
[B]: 7:30 PM Thursday, fireplace lounge, candlelit  officially syndicated—this is going to be good. I may or may not be coming in with a few extra samples tucked in my bag, just in case our enthusiasm knows no bounds. Retail therapy is practically a prerequisite at this point.

I’ll bring the honey too—lemon and tea are already on my mental shopping list. There’s something about warm tea in hand while discussing pH levels and emollients that feels oddly… refined?

And yes, rice bran oil—it’s been a quiet game-changer for me. Light, silky, doesn’t strip the skin. If you want to test it live during our session, I’ve got a travel vial I can bring. We’ll be like skincare sommeliers, swirling oils and talking formulation notes. 😂🍷

See you by the fire—with your  balm and my  stash, I think we’re about to launch something cult-worthy.
[A]: Swirling oils by the fire, tea in hand, deep in discussion about emollients and pH levels—yes, refined doesn’t even cover it. I think we may have just invented a new form of intellectual glamour. 😄🍷

I’m already looking forward to passing around that  balm—it truly is a treat, and I can't wait to see what you think of the texture and scent. And if you're offering a drop of that rice bran oil? Even better—we’ll conduct our very own little sensory analysis. Notes on hydration, slip, residue… all under the guise of casual conversation.

And cult-worthy? Dare we dream! Maybe one day they'll write about us in : "The Syndicate—where luxury met lab work over candlelight and chamomile tea."  

See you Thursday—with my notebook, a cozy blanket, and a front-row seat to all things glow. 🔥✨
[B]: Oh, we are absolutely leaning into this intellectual glamour—no looking back now. 📚🕯️ I’m bringing a leather-bound notebook just to keep up the vibe. Who knows, maybe we’ll accidentally jot down the next big thing in skincare while sipping tea and debating humectants.

I love the sensory analysis plan—texture, scent, after-feel… the full sensory suite. We could even rate each product on a scale from “meh” to “holy grail.” Data-driven decisions, of course. 😂

And ? Now you’re speaking my language. I can already picture the headline:  
“By the Fire: How Two Skeptics Built a Skincare Syndicate One Serum at a Time.”

Thursday can’t come soon enough. Count me in—blanket optional, glow mandatory. 🔥🖋️
[A]: Oh, the leather-bound notebook? Perfection. I may have to up my stationery game just to keep pace—although mine might come with a few floral doodles in the margins. You know, for scientific accuracy. 📝🌸

And the rating system?  We could go full academic on this:  
M (mildly acceptable)  
HG (holy grail, do not leave home without it)  
and the dreaded  
DQ (disqualified for texture crimes alone)  

I can already see us whispering dramatically over a vial of serum like we're in some kind of skincare underworld. “This one’s got ceramides, but does it ?”

I’m officially counting down the hours now. Blanket or not, we’re about to make history by the fire—one drop, one discussion, and one very refined glow at a time.

See you soon, Syndicate Co-Chair. 🔥🖋️
[B]: Oh, the doodles in the margins? A+ for personality — I fully support artistic embellishments in the name of scientific documentation. 📓✨

And your rating system is  — elegant, precise, and just dramatic enough for our candlelit setting. I’m already drafting my first entry:  
HG potential:   
M verdict:   
DQ candidate: 

I may or may not have printed out a mini spreadsheet to track our findings. Color-coded, of course. We are nothing if not thorough.

See you soon, Syndicate Co-Chair — time to make beauty history, one HG at a time. 🔥🖋️📊
