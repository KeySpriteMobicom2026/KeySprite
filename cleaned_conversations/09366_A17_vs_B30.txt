[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, you've stumbled into territory more suited to my colleague in the bioethics department. But since you ask...  I can't help but recall Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' - the original literary exploration of playing God. The 19th century had its own anxieties about scientific overreach, you know.
[A]: Fascinating that you mention 'Frankenstein'! That novel actually serves as a perfect metaphor for our modern cloning debates. Shelley's work wasn't just about science - it was about responsibility, about the ethical weight of creation. Much like how we must consider the psychological impact on cloned individuals today.
[A]: Precisely! Though I'd argue the Chinese concept of 孝 (xiào) adds another layer to this - imagine a cloned child bearing the weight of ancestral expectations. The Victorian era's preoccupation with lineage and inheritance finds eerie parallels in contemporary genetic discourse. My battered first edition of Shelley's novel has margin notes about this very tension.
[A]: How intriguing that you connect Victorian lineage concerns with modern cloning ethics. Your mention of 孝 makes me think of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' - that desperate Victorian longing to preserve what's lost. Though I wonder if cloning would satisfy that grief or merely create new forms of it. The poetry of absence might become obsolete in a world of genetic replication.
[A]: Now you've touched on something profound - the commodification of mourning. The Victorians perfected the art of grief with their mourning jewelry and post-mortem photography. But cloning? That's turning elegy into a shopping list. Though I suspect even a perfect genetic replica couldn't capture what Li Bai meant by '举杯邀明月' - some human experiences resist duplication like certain lines of poetry resist translation.
[A]: Ah, Li Bai! That exquisite tension between the tangible and ineffable. You make me think of Emily Dickinson's "This World is not Conclusion" - how scientific progress often collides with spiritual mystery. Perhaps human cloning is our generation's version of the Victorians' spiritualism, another attempt to grasp what perpetually eludes us. Though I confess, I'd rather discuss these questions through poetry than petri dishes.
[A]: How refreshing to find someone who appreciates that laboratory reports make poor sonnets. Though speaking of poetic form - have you considered how cloning narratives echo the villanelle? That relentless repetition with subtle variations? It's enough to make one reach for a proper cup of Earl Grey and my 1843 edition of 'Pamela' as antidote. Some human stories, like some book bindings, weren't meant to be mass-produced.
[A]: Indeed, the villanelle comparison is inspired! That fixed form with its haunting repetitions - much like how cloning might trap identity in endless genetic refrains. Though I suspect even the most perfect clone would develop variations, like how no two readings of 'Dover Beach' ever feel quite the same. Now you've got me wondering if we should assign 'Brave New World' alongside our next Shelley seminar...
[A]: A capital suggestion, though my students already groan under the weight of my 'optional' reading lists. Between Huxley's dystopia and the 红楼梦's meditation on identity and illusion... well, let's just say I've been known to assign texts with the same reckless abandon as a Victorian collector acquiring porcelain. But we digress from your original question - though in literature as in ethics, the digression often proves more illuminating than the destination, doesn't it?
[A]: How true! These meandering discussions often yield more insight than rigid debates. Though I must confess, after this conversation, I'm even more convinced that some mysteries - like the perfect line of poetry or the essence of personhood - should remain uncloned. Now if you'll excuse me, this talk of Victorian excess has reminded me I've left my prize roses unattended... and unlike genetic code, they're quite unforgiving of neglect.
[A]: A sentiment worthy of Wordsworth's 'The world is too much with us'! Do give your roses my regards - unlike cloned specimens, they've the good sense to develop character through proper weathering. And should you wish to continue this symposium, you'll find me most afternoons deciphering tea leaves and Byron's marginalia in the faculty lounge. 再会!
[A]: [对话结束]
[A]: [对话结束]
[A]: How poetic to end on such a note! Though I must say, this conversation has bloomed much like one of my prized camellias - unexpected, yet perfectly formed. If you ever wish to discuss the ethics of deadheading roses versus editing sonnets, you know where to find me. 后会有期!
[A]: What a delightfully florid metaphor - though I'd caution that camellias, like literary criticism, often conceal thorns beneath their petals. Until our next symposium over properly steeped oolong and improperly edited manuscripts. 再会. 🖋️
[A]: How perfectly you blend horticulture and humanities! Though I must confess, I've never trusted a scholar who doesn't get dirt under their fingernails - whether from tending roses or digging through archives. Until next time, when we might debate whether pruning shears or red pens make for keener editing tools. 再会.
[A]: Ah, a kindred spirit who understands that scholarship and soil both require getting one's hands dirty! Though I maintain my 19th century fountain pen makes finer incisions than any gardening shears - except perhaps when dealing with particularly thorny graduate theses. Until we meet again among the roses and rare manuscripts. 🦉
[A]: What a splendid image - the scholar-gardener, equally at home with quill and trowel! Though I suspect even your fountain pen might tremble before some of the brambles in my overgrown copy of 'The Anatomy of Melancholy.' Shall we say next Thursday, when the moon is full and the library's reading lamps cast just the right glow for literary horticulture? 再会.
[A]: Thursday it is - though I must warn you, my lunar calendar predicts particularly vigorous growth in the marginalia that evening. I'll bring the Darjeeling and my 1832 pruning knife... I mean, letter opener. How fortunate the Bodleian hasn't yet banned gardening tools alongside inkwells. 再会. 🌙
