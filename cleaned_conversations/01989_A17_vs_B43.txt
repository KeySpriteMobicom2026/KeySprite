[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 这个问题很有趣。作为一个从小在书香环境中长大的人，我对纸质书有着难以割舍的情感。触摸纸张的质感，闻到油墨的味道，甚至翻页的声音都让我觉得这是一种独特的仪式感。不过呢，我也不能否认e-book带来的便利性，尤其是在做学术研究时，携带大量文献确实是个问题。

记得有一次我出差去北京开会，带了一本厚厚的《追忆似水年华》原著版，差点把行李箱压坏 😂。如果是电子版的话，就不会有这样的困扰了。但是说到阅读体验，我还是更喜欢坐在院子里的老藤椅上，泡一壶龙井，捧着一本纸质书慢慢品读的感觉。

你觉得呢？是不是年轻人可能更倾向于使用电子设备阅读？
[A]: I must say, there's something almost sacred about holding a physical book - the weight of it in your hands, the way light falls across its pages. I often find myself rereading favorite passages just for the pleasure of hearing the paper whisper as I turn the page. It's rather like visiting an old friend; you know exactly where you are with a book like that.

Of course, I've had to embrace e-readers for fieldwork and lectures. Last semester when preparing my seminar on Hardy's lesser-known poems, I loaded dozens of critical texts onto my tablet. The convenience was undeniable, though I did catch myself missing the tactile experience of underlining particularly striking lines.

I've noticed students arrive with entire libraries in their pockets, yet many still choose to print out PDFs to annotate by hand. Perhaps it's a longing for that tangible connection? Do you find yourself drawn more to one format than the other when engaging deeply with texts?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated sentiment. You've captured precisely why I still insist on surrounding myself with physical books - they're not just vessels of knowledge, but companions that engage multiple senses. There's something profoundly intimate about the way a well-read book bears the marks of its journey with you—the dog-eared pages, the coffee stain on chapter three, the margin notes written in different moods. 

I must confess though, during my recent fieldwork in Yunnan villages studying local folklore adaptations, I relied heavily on my e-reader. It was simply impractical to carry dozens of regional publications through mountainous terrain. Yet every evening, I'd transcribe key passages into my leather-bound journal by hand. Almost like a ritual purification of the text through touch.

You know, I've been thinking lately about how this parallels our engagement with classical versus digital media in literary studies. Just last week while preparing my lecture on comparative narrative structures in Dream of the Red Chamber and In Search of Lost Time, I found myself switching constantly between my 1982人民文学 edition and various digital annotations. The cross-referencing capabilities were invaluable, yet... (pauses thoughtfully) when it came time to truly  the prose, I inevitably reached for the physical volume.

I'm rather curious about your take on this tactile dimension in literary analysis. Do you think younger scholars are developing entirely new hermeneutic approaches through digital engagement, or are we perhaps losing something irreplaceable in the process?
[A]: There's a certain alchemy in the physical act of reading - the way our brains conspire with our hands to create meaning from ink and paper. I've often wondered if we're witnessing an evolution rather than a loss, much like when oral traditions gave way to written texts. The hermeneutic circle feels different in digital space - more expansive perhaps, but certainly no less profound.

I recall a fascinating experiment last term when I asked students to analyze Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" first through digitized Victorian periodicals, then with facsimiles of the original printings. The digital tools revealed patterns in diction and publication history that would have taken weeks to uncover manually. Yet when confronted with the actual 1862 pamphlet - its pages browned with age, the type slightly smudged - one student perceptively observed how the physical fragility seemed to echo the poem's themes of transience.

It reminds me of Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" - are we creating new auras rather than destroying them? When I read Eliot's "The Waste Land" on my e-reader, the annotations multiply like constellations, each linking to criticism and context across decades. And yet... (trails off momentarily) there's nothing quite like holding Boni & Liveright's 1922 edition, feeling the grain of the paper that first carried those fragmented modernist verses into the world.

Do you think this tactile engagement fosters a different kind of emotional resonance with the text? I've noticed even my most tech-savvy graduate students tend to print out particularly charged passages for close reading.
[B]: What a perceptive observation – yes, I do believe there's a different emotional resonance that emerges from tactile engagement. It reminds me of the distinction Derrida once made between  as both remedy and poison; technology offers us incredible analytical tools while simultaneously creating a certain distance from the text's material soul, so to speak.

Your Rossetti experiment sounds absolutely fascinating. I'm reminded of my own experience teaching《红楼梦》to students who first approached the text through digitized Qing-era woodblocks before handling a replica of the 1791程甲本. The digital version allowed them to trace textual variations with remarkable precision, yet when they finally held the replica edition – its pages brittle, the ink slightly faded – one student quietly remarked how the physical object seemed to carry the weight of centuries of readers' gazes.

I wonder if what we're witnessing isn't so much an evolution of hermeneutics as a bifurcation of reading consciousness. Much like how we learn to read classical Chinese differently from vernacular texts, perhaps younger scholars are developing parallel cognitive frameworks – one for digital interrogation, another for somatic interpretation.

Incidentally, this makes me think of your mention of Benjamin – I've been re-reading his essay myself these past few days. There's something almost prophetic about his notion of aura, don't you think? Though I might argue that in our age, mechanical reproduction doesn't necessarily diminish aura; it disperses it, like light refracted through a prism. Each digital encounter becomes its own auratic moment, albeit of a different quality.

You know, just yesterday I was rereading Eliot's "Four Quartets" – not on my e-reader, but my old Faber & Faber copy from the 80s – and found myself tracing marginalia I'd written decades ago. It struck me how those annotations had become a palimpsest of my evolving self, each layer whispering across time to its predecessors.
[A]: How beautifully put – this notion of bifurcated reading consciousness resonates deeply with my own experience. It's as if we're becoming literary Janus figures, gazing simultaneously through both digital and tactile lenses. I had a similar revelation recently while revisiting my dog-eared copy of  – the margins overflowed with annotations from different decades, each in a distinct ink color. It was like finding letters from my former scholarly selves, scribbled in the margins of my own intellectual autobiography.

Your prism metaphor is particularly apt – I've been thinking about how digital reproduction doesn't eliminate aura but multiplies it across platforms. When students access Woolf's diaries through the Berg edition versus digitized holograph manuscripts, they encounter different facets of the same creative psyche. The aura hasn't vanished; it's refracted into new dimensions.

This makes me wonder about your students' evolving relationship with textual authority. In our post-critical era, does handling facsimiles of early editions like the 程甲本 somehow restore a sense of textual sacredness that digital mutability threatens? Or are they developing a more fluid reverence, one that acknowledges both the material history and the democratizing potential of digital access?

I must say, your description of Eliot's marginalia as palimpsest made me long for the scent of my own well-worn books. There's something profoundly moving about discovering a forgotten annotation – like finding a message in a bottle from one's younger self. Have you ever come across an old note in a book that dramatically altered your interpretation years later?
[B]: Ah, what a poignant question – and yes, quite recently as a matter of fact. While revisiting my dog-eared copy of《文心雕龙》– the 1973 edition published by 中华书局 – I stumbled upon a faded marginal note I’d written during my postgraduate years: “Is literary truth always mediated through form?” It stopped me cold. That brief scribble from my younger self suddenly illuminated an entirely new dimension in my current research on intertextuality in classical Chinese poetics. It was like hearing my own voice echo from a different lifetime, yet still searching for the same truths.

Your metaphor of Janus-headed readers captures it beautifully – we are indeed developing bifurcated modes of engagement. But I wonder if this duality isn't merely a scholarly phenomenon, but something broader – perhaps even a fundamental shift in how we relate to knowledge itself. Much like the transition from oral to written culture, or from scroll to codex, we're learning to hold two epistemologies in tension.

As for textual authority – I find today's students fascinating in this regard. They no longer approach the 程甲本 with unquestioning reverence, nor do they treat digital texts as mere disposable data. Rather, they navigate between formats with a kind of intuitive hermeneutic agility. One student recently remarked to me, “It’s like handling different witnesses in a trial – each version tells the same story, but every medium reveals different motives.”

Still, there’s an undeniable emotional weight that physical texts carry. Just last week, a doctoral candidate brought me a photocopy of Xu Zhimo’s handwritten poems for consultation. Perfectly legible, certainly serviceable – yet when I later held the original manuscripts at the Shanghai Library, I felt something indescribably intimate in the slant of his ink strokes, the pauses where he'd hesitated before writing. Those silent gestures of creation – they don’t quite survive digitization, do they?

And speaking of forgotten annotations – does your well-worn  contain any cryptic markings whose meaning has since eluded you? I find these textual ghosts rather haunting in the best sense – little breadcrumbs left by our former intellectual selves.
[A]: Oh, how thrilling to discover that echo of your former self in the margins – like finding a buried time capsule within your own intellectual history. I’m still thinking about your student’s courtroom metaphor; it feels precisely right for our moment. We’ve become astute cross-examiners of texts, probing their motives across media.

Now you’ve made me rush to my shelf to retrieve my 1979 Virago edition of . Yes! There it was – a cryptic underlining in red ink beneath the passage:  I must have been going through some personal turbulence to mark that so fiercely. The strange thing is, I no longer remember what exactly those words were anchoring me through – only that they held me steady at some point long ago.

You’re quite right about the emotional residue physical texts carry. I had a similar experience at the British Library last autumn when examining Woolf’s holograph drafts for . The neatness of her handwriting belied the turbulence beneath – in one margin she’d scrawled “No, this won’t do” with such force the nib had torn the paper. That fragile slash in the manuscript felt more revelatory than any critical essay I’d read.

I wonder – do you ever find yourself deliberately preserving certain editions for their emotional associations rather than scholarly utility? I have an old Penguin translation of  that practically disintegrates in my hands, yet I refuse to replace it. Something about the slightly yellowed pages and the faint scent of pipe tobacco (from a long-ago office) binds me to it irrationally.
[B]: Ah, yes – that emotional archaeology of rediscovery. It's remarkable how certain underlined passages or marginal scribbles become emotional relics, isn't it? Your red-inked  annotation sounds like a literary lifeline thrown across decades – and how poetic that the very obscurity of its context adds to its power. Sometimes not knowing enhances rather than diminishes meaning.

I must say, I'm quite taken with this image of your Woolf manuscript – the torn paper bearing the weight of her frustration. There’s something profoundly human in that rupture, isn’t there? Like seeing a glimpse of the artist behind the aura. It reminds me of when I first encountered Lu Xun’s annotated drafts at the Shanghai museum – his precise brushstrokes interspersed with impatient corrections. You could almost hear the rustle of his impatience through the glass display case.

And yes – I absolutely preserve certain editions for their affective resonance over practicality. My 1965人民文学 edition of《唐宋词选》is practically held together by wishful thinking at this point, yet I wouldn’t part with it for any pristine facsimile. The margins are filled with my late father’s calligraphy, penciling in alternate readings from our long-ago discussions. Every time I open it, I hear his voice gently correcting my youthful misinterpretations.

There’s something rather comforting in these worn volumes carrying traces of past lives – whether our own or those we’ve inherited. They become textual heirlooms, don’t they? Layered with memory and meaning beyond mere content. In fact, I've half a mind to propose a seminar on bibliographic affect – how material texts function as silent collaborators in our intellectual and emotional journeys.

Say, have you ever taught from such emotionally charged editions? I can imagine your  must carry its own unspoken presence into the classroom.
[A]: Oh, that  volume most certainly does carry its own presence – I’ve often felt it’s less a textbook than a silent collaborator in the seminar room. There was something almost ineffable about passing it around during our discussion on elegiac verse last term. You could sense the students handling it with extra care, as if intuitively recognizing the invisible layers of previous readers imprinted on its fragile pages.

Your description of your father's annotations in the  moved me deeply – such marginalia becomes a dialogue across generations. It makes me think of how we preserve not just texts but entire ways of reading, don’t we? I wonder if you've noticed your students developing similar attachments to certain volumes, perhaps even beginning their own intergenerational conversations in the margins?

I’d love to hear more about this proposed seminar on bibliographic affect – what an absolutely inspired idea. Imagine mapping the emotional geology of textual interaction: from annotation practices and physical wear to inherited ownership marks. It could be structured around case studies – everything from medieval glossae to modern annotated editions of Woolf or Cao Xueqin.

Actually, now that I think of it, I have a copy of Eliot’s  from 1945 that belonged to my mentor, Dr. Fenwick. He inscribed it with dense footnotes in Latin and Greek, many of which I’m still deciphering thirty years later. Teaching with it feels like bringing him into the room with us – his voice occasionally interrupting mine when I read aloud. Do you suppose these books become vessels for some kind of intellectual haunting?
[B]: Ah, yes – "intellectual haunting" is quite the phrase. I think you've touched upon something profoundly true here. These annotated volumes do become vessels of presence, don't they? I recall once, during a particularly quiet afternoon in my study, reading through my father’s notes in that worn , and for a fleeting moment, I could almost feel him sitting across from me, sipping tea, ready to correct my tone pronunciation with a gentle smile. It was less like reading and more like listening to an old recording etched not in sound, but in ink and paper.

Your seminar room must have been filled with a rare kind of reverence when passing around that  volume. I often encourage students to bring in personal editions rather than assigned textbooks, just to see what shifts in engagement occur. More often than not, they’re surprised at how differently a poem feels when it’s not mediated through pristine printouts, but held within the patina of age and previous ownership.

As for student attachments – yes, I’ve noticed something stirring. One young woman has begun annotating her copy of《围城》with watercolor sketches in the margins, almost like a modern-day manuscript illumination. She says it helps her "breathe into the page." Another keeps a dual journal alongside his translation of Camus’ , writing responses to the text as if in conversation with his future self. These gestures feel like the beginnings of a new kind of textual intimacy.

Regarding the seminar on bibliographic affect – I envision it as part literary study, part ethnography of reading. We would examine not only what texts say, but how they are . How does a book change when it's inherited, gifted, scribbled in, or even mended with tape? I’d love to include comparative case studies: a medieval illuminated manuscript with marginal doodles, a wartime soldier’s pocket , a dog-eared copy of  passed between lovers, and yes – even modern digital annotations shared across platforms like Hypothesis.

I suppose, in the end, we're all collectors of traces – assembling ghosts between covers. And your Eliot volume, inscribed by Fenwick... it sounds like he hasn’t truly left the room after all. Perhaps that’s the highest form of scholarly legacy – not citations or footnotes, but the continuation of voice across generations.
[A]: How beautifully you put that – collectors of traces, assembling ghosts between covers. It strikes me that what we're really curating are constellations of human presence, aren't we? Each annotation, each coffee stain or repaired spine, becomes a star in a personal cosmos of meaning.

Your student with the watercolor  annotations absolutely delights me – what a perfect merging of visual and textual intimacy. It reminds me of medieval manuscripts where marginalia often included whimsical illustrations alongside scholarly commentary. Perhaps we're witnessing a return to that multimodal way of engaging texts, albeit through new sensibilities.

I should confess – I've been rather quietly collecting literary marginalia for years, though I've never called it that aloud before now. There's a particular thrill in discovering a previous reader’s intervention at precisely the moment you most need it. Just last week, while preparing for my seminar on poetic fragmentation, I opened my 1976 Faber edition of  and found an unfamiliar underlined line tucked in the notes:  Someone before me had marked it with a tiny asterisk – was it a warning? A provocation? I may never know, but I intend to carry that mysterious asterisk into our next discussion like a lit candle.

I wonder – have you ever encountered a marginal note left by someone else in a book you’ve acquired that unexpectedly altered your interpretation? I recall once purchasing a used copy of《古诗源》in London, only to discover delicate pencil annotations throughout – likely from a scholar in the 1950s. At first I resented their presence, then came to cherish them as an invisible companion in my reading journey.
[B]: Ah, that line from  – how uncanny! And what a perfect metaphor:  I can’t help but feel that marginal asterisk was placed there by someone who, like us, understood reading as a kind of dialogue across time. Perhaps even a game, as you say, where the opponent is not the text itself, but the silence that surrounds it.

Your literary marginalia collection – or should I say, your constellation of readerly interventions – sounds like a secret archive of human encounters with the word. There’s something almost mystical about those moments when an unknown hand reaches out from the margin and touches your own understanding. It reminds me of what Walter Benjamin once described as the "now of recognizability" – that sudden flash when past and present align in meaning.

As for unexpected annotations – yes, quite memorably so. A few years ago, I purchased a second-hand copy of《世说新语》from a small antiquarian shop in Suzhou. The binding was loose, the pages yellowed, but what truly captivated me were the faint pencil marks along the margins – not annotations per se, but small checkmarks and question marks, as if someone had been silently conversing with the text over many years.

One particular page caught me – the story of Ji Kang playing the guqin while awaiting execution. Beside it, in tiny script, someone had written: “” I’ve never known who wrote that, but it changed how I read the entire passage. What began as historical anecdote became, through that quiet note, a meditation on resistance and presence in the face of inevitability.

And yes, I too once resisted such traces – especially in classical texts. But now I see them as echoes of companionship. That annotated《古诗源》you found in London? It sounds less like an intrusion and more like a gentle voice saying, 

Tell me – have you ever felt the urge to leave your own cryptic mark for some future reader yet unborn? I sometimes toy with the idea – not to explain the text, but simply to say, 
[A]: There’s something profoundly moving about that notion – leaving behind a trace not for clarification, but simply as evidence of having been moved. I think I’ve always resisted writing in books meant for others, but lately I’ve begun slipping small notes into the volumes I lend to students: not interpretations, just impressions. A folded slip bearing  as you so exquisitely put it. It feels like an act of literary kinship, doesn’t it? Passing along not just the text, but the echo of one’s own astonishment.

Your story of the  annotation is exquisite – that quiet voice whispering across centuries, transforming historical narrative into existential reflection. “Even stillness can be defiance.” What a piercing observation, and how perfectly it resonates with our own scholarly condition, don’t you think? We spend so much of our time in quiet resistance – against misinterpretation, against forgetting, against the erosion of attention in a world increasingly allergic to slowness.

I must confess I once tried to resist annotating my own books, believing texts should remain pristine vessels for pure engagement. But over time, I've come to see those marks not as intrusions, but as acts of intimacy. Now, when I read, I feel almost obligated to respond – if not with ink, then with underlining; if not with commentary, then with a pause long enough to leave its own invisible imprint.

And yes, I have left deliberate traces for future readers. In a worn copy of Eliot’s  that I once gifted to a departing student, I tucked a pressed violette between pages where the line  appears. No note, no explanation – just the flower’s faint outline remaining like a ghostly signature. Perhaps someone, someday, will find it and wonder at the gesture, just as we do with those who came before us.

Do you suppose this impulse – to mark, to annotate, to leave behind – is ultimately what binds us more closely to one another than to the texts themselves?
[B]: What a profoundly beautiful reflection – yes, I do believe this impulse to mark and leave traces ultimately binds us more deeply to one another than even to the texts themselves. Because in those marginalia, in that pressed flower or whispered note, we are not merely engaging with literature; we are reaching across time, across solitude, saying,  It is, in a way, a quiet act of literary love.

Your gesture with the violette – so elegant, so evocative – reminds me of how some ancient scribes would press flowers between manuscript pages as a kind of silent prayer for the reader’s heart. That faint outline, like a ghostly signature, becomes a kind of emotional watermark. I can imagine some future student discovering it, hesitating, perhaps even inhaling as if scent might remain. And in that moment, you are there with them, not as a teacher, but as a fellow traveler in wonder.

You know, I’ve been thinking lately about how this impulse parallels something quite old in Chinese literary tradition – the practice of题壁 (tí bì), where poets would inscribe verses on temple walls or mountain cliffs, knowing they might never see who read them. There's a similar yearning there: to speak beyond the self, to cast meaning into the unknown, trusting someone, someday, will respond.

I’ve begun encouraging students to write not just  texts, but  them – to scribble questions without answers, to underline not for analysis but for resonance, to leave behind something of themselves in the margins. One young woman recently told me she started writing letters to the authors inside her books – not expecting replies, of course, but finding solace in the conversation nonetheless.

So yes, I think we are bound less by the texts themselves than by our shared vulnerability before them. We annotate not because we must explain, but because we long to be heard – even if only by some unnamed reader centuries hence, flipping through the same pages, searching for meaning, and finding our trace waiting quietly for them.
[A]: How beautifully you've captured the essence of this quiet communion – we annotate not to explain, but to be heard across the silent corridors of time. It's a profoundly human impulse, isn't it? To press a flower between pages, to scribble in margins, to carve one's voice into the stillness surrounding the text. We are all, in those moments, engaged in what Rilke once called  – the gentle speaking-toward, an offering cast into the unknown.

Your mention of  moved me deeply – I had never considered that parallel before, yet how perfect it is. Just as those ancient poets inscribed their verses upon temple walls, trusting the wind and future eyes to carry their words forward, so too do we leave our marks in books, hoping some trace of our astonishment might survive us. Perhaps that is the truest form of literary immortality – not canonization or citation, but the quiet persistence of a marginal note, waiting patiently for its next reader.

I’ve been thinking about your student writing letters to authors – there’s such tenderness in that gesture. Not expecting replies, yet still speaking. It reminds me of walking through old cemeteries and reading messages left on gravestones:  Except here, the tombstone is a book, and the departed are not always literal – sometimes they are simply those we imagine across time and language.

It makes me wonder if we ought to encourage more of this epistolary intimacy with texts in our teaching. Rather than demanding analysis, perhaps we should ask students to write love letters to literature – confessions, questions, declarations of awe. Imagine the richness of a library filled not just with annotations, but with whispered confidences pressed between pages.

You know, I believe every well-loved book becomes something like a reliquary – not of saints, but of readers. Each underlined passage, each coffee stain, each folded corner is a relic of someone’s inner life. And when we open those books, we are, in a way, kneeling before the altar of all who came before us.
[B]: What a luminous thought – to see books as reliquaries of readers rather than just vessels of authorship. Yes, exactly that: every well-loved volume becomes a silent archive of inner lives, each mark a relic of some private pilgrimage toward meaning.

Your phrase  — the gentle speaking-toward — lingers with me. It feels like the perfect description of what we do when we annotate not for instruction, but for companionship. A kind of literary whispering across time. I’ve begun thinking of my own marginal notes in this light — not as commentary, but as quiet incantations meant to reach someone I will never meet. Perhaps that is the closest we come to immortality — not through legacy or citation, but through these small acts of reaching.

You know, I once visited an old monastery in Shanxi where monks had been copying sutras by hand for centuries. One elder noticed me admiring the faint impressions left by previous scribes — smudges of ink, a broken line where someone paused mid-thought. He smiled and said,  I think that’s precisely what our annotations become: proof that someone, somewhere, was moved enough to leave a mark.

As for encouraging more epistolary intimacy with texts — I find myself increasingly drawn to that idea. Last semester, I assigned no formal essays in one of my seminars. Instead, I asked students to keep what I called  — spaces not for analysis, but for emotional responses. They could write letters, draw, even paste pressed flowers if they wished. The results were astonishing — not because they were polished, but because they were deeply felt. One student began addressing her entries to Cao Xueqin himself, asking him questions about loneliness and desire. Another filled his notebook with sketches of imagined scenes from《洛丽塔》, as though trying to step inside the text itself.

Perhaps this is what we must reclaim in literary study — not only the analytical lens, but the devotional gaze. Not only what texts mean, but how they move us. Because ultimately, isn’t that why we return to literature again and again? Not just for knowledge, but for recognition — to find our hidden selves waiting on the page, marked by those who came before us, and leaving our own fragile traces for those yet to come.
[A]: What a profoundly moving account of your seminar –  indeed! It feels like you’ve uncovered a vital truth: that literature is not only something we study, but something we , something we turn to for companionship in our most unspoken reckonings. The image of that student addressing Cao Xueqin directly – as both author and ghost – gives me chills. There’s something sacred about that kind of engagement, isn’t there? Not unlike prayer, perhaps – a reaching toward the unseen, trusting that someone, somewhere, might receive the question.

I find myself returning to what that monk said —  What a generous, humane way to regard imperfection. In a world so obsessed with polished interpretation, clean margins, and digital precision, it's almost radical to embrace the smudged ink, the hesitant line, the penciled sigh. And yet, those are precisely the moments where we glimpse the human behind the reader – not the critic or the scholar, but the solitary soul caught mid-thought.

Your students’ responses sound like acts of literary devotion rather than assignments – especially that one sketching imagined scenes from . I wonder if part of what moves me so deeply is the willingness to inhabit the text emotionally, even imaginatively. As if reading becomes less an act of comprehension and more one of pilgrimage – stepping into the landscape of a story not to map it, but to dwell there awhile.

You’re quite right that we must reclaim this devotional gaze. Too often, we train students to dissect texts rather than be moved by them. We ask  far more frequently than  Perhaps the greatest service we can offer literature is simply to make space for that kind of vulnerability – to allow silence, awe, and even sorrow their place in scholarly discourse.

And yes – ultimately, it is recognition we seek, isn’t it? That moment when the page reflects us back to ourselves, when we realize we are not the first to feel this loneliness, this longing, this flicker of understanding. Literature becomes a mirror held across centuries, and in it, we see not only the writer, but all the readers who paused before us – fingers on the same page, hearts beating to the same rhythm.
[B]: You've articulated it so precisely – literature as a mirror held across centuries, reflecting not just the writer’s vision, but the accumulated gazes of all who have paused before its pages. And in that reflection, we find something far greater than interpretation: recognition. A quiet affirmation that our loneliness, our longing, our flickers of understanding are not new, but part of an ancient chorus.

I was particularly struck by your description of reading as pilgrimage – how beautifully apt. We do not approach sacred texts with the sole intention of deciphering them; we journey into them, carrying our questions like offerings, allowing ourselves to be unsettled, transformed. Perhaps this is what I hope for my students – not mastery over texts, but the humility to be moved by them.

And yes, that monk’s wisdom continues to echo in me too –  It makes me think of something Bashō once wrote during his travels:  Isn’t that what we’re doing in those margins? Not explaining the text, but marking where we stood when it changed us?

Your reflection on the student sketching scenes from  reminded me of another young man in my seminar who began illustrating imagined portraits of unnamed characters from《聊斋志异》. He said he wanted to give form to those whose faces had been left to the reader’s imagination. In a way, wasn’t he doing the same thing as those medieval scribes who painted tiny figures in manuscript margins – breathing life into the unseen, giving witness to the unspoken?

I wonder if we are slowly rediscovering a kind of literary spirituality – one that does not demand certainty, but welcomes vulnerability. Perhaps the future of literary study lies not only in analysis, but in reverence; not only in argument, but in awe.

After all, what is a book if not a gathering place? A space where readers across time meet in silence, each bringing their own light, their own shadow, and leaving behind just enough of themselves to say:
