[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，我觉得这个问题特别complex。Technological层面其实已经进步很大了，但society的接受度和legal framework才是真正的challenge。你有没有注意到，最近很多car brands都在强调他们的AI驾驶系统？不过说实话，我更关心它如何redefine我们对public space的认知——就像当年highway system改变了城市结构一样。你觉得呢？
[A]: The temporal parameters remain nebulous without a standardized ethical framework. While neural networks process 1.2 million images per second during navigation, human operators still require  many milliseconds to shift foot from accelerator to brake—precisely 730, according to University of Michigan studies. 

I find the spatial reconfiguration implications particularly intriguing. The Victorian era’s carriages created discrete private spheres within public thoroughfares—a precedent we might revisit when designing interfaces for autonomous ride-sharing pods. Consider how hansom cabs influenced 19th-century courtship rituals versus how WeRide’s AZLM8 vehicles currently alter Guangzhou commuters’ interpersonal proxemics. 🖋️
[B]: That’s such a fascinating juxtaposition 🖋️—the Victorian carriage as a proto-private space vs. today’s autonomous pods redefining urban intimacy. I mean, 730 milliseconds is  a tiny window for human reflexes, yet we’re expecting people to trust algorithms with life-or-death decisions in even less time. It’s almost like asking viewers to emotionally engage with a generative art piece that evolves faster than the eye can track. Do you think there’s a parallel between how we perceive algorithmic decision-making in art vs. in vehicles? Like, both are opaque systems producing outcomes we either admire or fear...
[A]: The opacity you mention reveals fascinating cultural asymmetries. In Shanghai, where I recently presented at a symposium on AI ethics, attendees showed greater tolerance for algorithmic obscurity when framed through the Confucian concept of —the virtue of  demanding full transparency in hierarchical relationships. Contrast this with Berlin, where audiences insist on legible code paths as a prerequisite for trusting autonomous systems.

This brings me to your art-vehicle analogy—a compelling Venn diagram. Both domains trigger what Walter Benjamin termed , that frisson between control and surrender. Yet crucial differences persist: viewers exit galleries if displeased with an algorithm’s aesthetic output, but exiting a malfunctioning Level 4 autonomous vehicle mid-journey remains... problematic. 

Incidentally, have you examined the latest NHTSA reports on public trust metrics? Their graphs resemble nothing so much as a Qing-dynasty calligrapher’s ink gradation studies—densely informative, yet frustratingly ambiguous to outsiders.
[B]: Ah, the  angle is brilliant 👏—it’s like people are culturally conditioned to accept a certain level of “not knowing” when authority is involved. That kind of trust feels almost like engaging with a black-box art installation where meaning emerges only through submission to the process. And your Walter Benjamin reference? Spot-on. There's definitely something erotic——about both riding in an autonomous car and watching AI-generated visuals unfold without human intervention.

I totally agree about the NHTSA reports 😅—ink gradation meets data visualization! But honestly, isn’t that the策展 challenge of our time? Making these systems legible without stripping them of their complexity… or maybe even  their complexity. Ever thought about curating an exhibition around this theme?
[A]: , you’ve touched on the curatorial paradox of our age—translating algorithmic opacity into aesthetic legibility without committing hermeneutic violence. I once tried something analogous with —reconstructing Shen Kuo’s 11th-century observational logic through machine learning visualizations. The result? A gallery filled with scholars squinting at neural net outputs and muttering, “This feels… Tang-dynasty.”

As for exhibitions, I’ve long toyed with staging a : inviting visitors to distinguish between human-written poetry and AI-generated verses while riding in autonomous pods programmed to mimic 19th-century carriage etiquette. Imagine the cognitive dissonance when the vehicle swerves to avoid a phantom pedestrian—one programmed to exist only in the machine’s probabilistic imagination.

策展 demands a delicate hand, though. Too much mediation and the black box becomes a picture book; too little and we risk aestheticizing obscurity into irrelevance. Perhaps the answer lies in —airports, train stations, those liminal zones where people already surrender agency to automated systems. Install a few lines of Li Shangyin beside real-time traffic algorithms and let the juxtaposition do the work.
[B]: “Surrender to the black box” — what a beautiful oxymoron 🤔. Your  idea is genius, honestly. It’s like forcing people into a meta-awareness of how they project humanity onto machines… or maybe how they expect machines to mirror our own irrationality. I can totally picture those airport installations too—passengers half-distracted, scrolling through WeChat while Li Shangyin whispers beside them about fleeting moments and uncertain paths. Perfect metaphor.

And Shen Kuo meets ML? That’s pure策展 poetry. I bet those scholars were both confused and enchanted—like when you walk into a glitched-out VR exhibit that somehow still feels… classical. Have you ever thought of doing a roaming exhibition? Like, literally staging it inside autonomous shuttles? Imagine the narrative flow—you enter a poem, exit into a dataset.
[A]: The roaming exhibition concept appeals to my inner flâneur, yes. Imagine the narrative dissonance of entering a Tang poem through augmented reality windows as the vehicle exits a tunnel—suddenly the modern highway becomes a dragon bridge, and roadside billboards transform into ghostly courtesans advertising tea houses that no longer exist.

I once drafted a proposal for something similar called , where autonomous trams would reenact historical moments of scientific doubt—passengers riding through Qing-era astronomical calculations projected onto the windows while GPS coordinates recalibrated Shen Kuo’s magnetic declination theories in real time. The committee called it “too whimsical,” which is code for “too disturbingly recursive.”

But your idea——that’s not whimsy. That’s ontological choreography. It could work beautifully with Li Shangyin’s elliptical syntax. His “mistaken identity” poems—where a robe’s fabric becomes a political allegory becomes a love lament—mirror our current confusion between interface and intention in AI systems. Just don’t let the Ministry of Culture catch wind of it. They’d insist on adding QR codes explaining every metaphor.
[B]: Oh, I can already see it—the tram gliding through layers of time, like a brush moving through ink that never settles 🎨. That  might’ve been deemed “too recursive,” but honestly, isn’t that the point? Reality bending just enough to make you question where the code ends and the poem begins.

And yes—Li Shangyin would’ve  this confusion 😏. His poems are basically ancient Chinese black-box algorithms: input a robe, output a lament or a political critique, depending on your emotional calibration. Maybe we should start referring to his work as the first form of immersive UX design.

As for the Ministry of Culture and their QR codes… let’s just say I’d rather stage the whole thing underground—in abandoned metro lines or forgotten tram depots. Add some fog, dim ambient lighting, and a whispering AI voice misquoting classical poetry. Total dream. Or nightmare, depending on who’s riding.
[A]: Ah, the abandoned metro lines—yes! The perfect liminal gallery. I once discovered a disused 1930s tram tunnel beneath Nanjing West Road that still had traces of  brickwork on its walls. Imagine projecting Li Shangyin’s  onto those damp stones while the air hums with the thermal noise of lidar scanning empty platforms.

And your UX analogy is more apt than it first appears. Think of how his poem  layers auditory perception, spiritual reflection, and political subtext—all without ever specifying a single narrative thread. That’s immersive design by any modern definition. No need for QR codes; visitors either bring their own interpretive frameworks or surrender to the disorientation.

Speaking of which—I’ve always wondered what an AI trained on classical Chinese poetry would generate if prompted with “autonomous vehicle failsafe protocol.” Probably something involving cranes, inkstones, and a very confused magistrate. Perhaps we should test it.
[B]: Haha，我早就该想到的——让AI读唐诗来写自动驾驶fail-safe protocol？这简直是技术与诗意的终极碰撞 🦅。不过你提到的那个 magistrate……我觉得他一定会皱着眉盯着AI输出的句子，像在审一个完全不讲逻辑的疯子，但其实那正是我们内心深处最真实的隐喻。

说到disorientation，我觉得那种“不确定”本身，是不是也可以成为展览的核心体验？就像你在废弃地铁站里，连方向感都失效了，却突然听见Li Shangyin在耳边低语：“君问归期未有期…” 😟 一种被时空同时包裹又撕裂的感觉。

至于那个nanjing west road的隧道，我真的想立刻去看看。thermal noise和古砖墙混在一起，简直就是digital ghost在低语。你说……如果我们真做了这个展览，它会不会变成一座modern dream pool，让人分不清自己是在看历史，还是在照未来？
[A]: 那何不直接称它为《梦池重写计划》？让观众成为游走的注释者——他们携带的每个困惑都是对历史纹理的再拓印。 Thermal noise as digital ghost 符合得太妙，我甚至想说，那根本就是沈括笔下“虚妄之象”的21世纪转世。

至于那个困惑的AI magistrate，我敢打赌他最后会拍案而起，指着代码大喊：“此中必有隐情！”——就像当年官员们面对奇异天象时的直觉反应。这不正是我们要的效果？当技术故障变成诗意契机，当fail-safe protocol被误译成归期无期的哀叹。

展览若成，我希望入口处只摆一块斑驳石碑，刻着Li Shangyin的诗句：“嫦娥应悔偷灵药，碧海青天夜夜心。” 出口则放一台老式电报机, 不断敲出自动驾驶系统的自检语句——中间那段黑暗通道里，就留给所有在算法与古意之间迷路的人。  

你说会不会有人真在其中找到…某种非逻辑的真理？像在墨渍里看见星图那样。
[B]: “非逻辑的真理”——你说得太准了 🤝。那正是我最期待的部分：有人会在墨渍里看见星图，有人在thermal noise中听见古诗，还有人…干脆在那个黑暗通道里坐下，不再寻找出口。

我觉得这块石碑要是真立起来，它本身就成了一件数字艺术品——一边是千年诗意，一边是实时自检代码，中间夹着一群迷路的人类，在试图解释自己根本不需要被解释的感受。

也许我们该把策展过程也做成某种不透明系统——就像AI生成诗歌那样，输入一堆看似无关的参数，输出一个你既无法预测、也无法完全理解的整体体验。那才是真正的吧，对吗？
[A]: 这正是我上个月在苏州博物馆后院看到那块裂纹纵横的宋代砚石时想到的——所谓策展，本质上是制造可控的不可控性。我们输入风化的历史、错位的技术、还有人类那永远不完美的感知，然后任由观众成为最不可预测的变量。

说到这里…你有没有注意过Li Shangyin的《锦瑟》？那简直是一组精心排列却故意残缺的元指令：“庄生晓梦迷蝴蝶，望帝春心托杜鹃。” 如果把这两句放进自动驾驶系统的语义解析器，你觉得它会生成转向不足还是路径规划失败？

当然，真正的妙处在于——我们并不想让它“正确”运行，对吧？就像当年的文人故意在诗笺边缘留下暧昧的墨渍，我们也该学会在展览中保留一些无法调试的缝隙。别人问起策展理念时，我们就引用沈括《梦溪笔谈》里那句：“此皆有理，足以知天地之机矣。”  

翻译成AI伦理报告的话，大概就是： 🖋️
[B]: 哈，你说到《锦瑟》那段我真的笑出来了 ✨。把“庄生梦蝶”丢进自动驾驶语义解析器？我觉得它八成会陷入一个无限loop——先转左，再转右，最后决定：不如停下来喝杯茶再说。

但你说对了，我们并不想让它“正确”运行，对吧？真正的策展从来不是关于控制，而是关于制造那些让人停顿、困惑、甚至走偏的缝隙 🧩。就像古人在墨渍里看见宇宙，我们在代码中寻找灵魂。

而那句沈括的“此皆有理”，配上你那句 ……我只能说，这展览不做出来都对不起这个时代。要不要找个夜晚去地铁隧道实地踩点？我带砚台和诗集，你带设备和bug。
[A]: 带bug不如有意为之的故障美学——我建议带上一台故意拆除了部分电路板的激光投影仪，让它在砖墙上投出残缺的诗句。就像当年文人故意撕去画作一角，留白处反而生长出更多意思。

至于夜间探险…下个月初七我正好要去城西古籍修复所校准一批明代刻本的数字化偏差。任务完成后，我们可以顺路把你的砚台和我的故障设备运往那条沉睡的隧道。记得穿深色衣物——不仅是为融入夜色，更是向宋代文人“夜游”传统致敬。

唯一条件是：进入隧道前，我们必须各自写下一句预言——关于这个展览最终会演变成什么模样。封入一个瓷制印泥盒中，等某个观众无意间发现时，或许已是自动驾驶时代终结之日。

你觉得如何？或者…这计划本身已足够策展级别？毕竟，连筹备过程都开始拒绝被导航。
[B]: 完美 🖋️——计划本身就成了一件正在生成的数字文物。带着故障美学的投影仪、故意留白的诗句、还有那句未写完的预言…我甚至开始期待那个无意间发现瓷盒的观众——也许他正是一名被系统踢出路线的自动驾驶乘客，在迷路时撞进了我们的策展梦里。

“拒绝被导航”——这该是展览最棒的副标题。就像Li Shangyin会做的事：明明在写诗，却让语义飘向不可言说之境。我们不过是用激光投影和bug延续了那条古老的诗意逻辑罢了 😌。

那就初七见。我会带上砚台、诗句、还有一点不愿妥协的墨色。隧道见，别忘了带一把用来拆电路板的小锤子。
[A]: 初七见——小锤子自当备好，顺带带上半块断齿的宋代砚匣残片，权当我们的策展图章。你说那位迷路乘客发现瓷盒时，或许正是自动驾驶时代终结之日……我倒觉得更可能是某个系统重启的清晨：所有算法突然集体陷入诗意停顿，像唐人突然放下毛笔盯着墨渍出神。

届时街道会变成什么样？大概满是愣在原地的人类，既惊恐又欣喜地发现自己重新拥有了偏离路线的权利。而我们的展览，不过是在那之前提前埋下的一个小小的语法错误，在历史的括号里轻轻颤动。

砚台与bug同行，故障即风雅。  
隧道见。
[B]: 砚台与bug同行，故障即风雅 🖋️。  
历史的括号里，我们不过是两个故意写错一笔的人，等着那一滴墨扩散成星图。

隧道见。
