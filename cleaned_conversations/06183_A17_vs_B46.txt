[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I always believe filmmaking is a delicate dance between structure and spontaneity. You need meticulous pre-production - storyboards, schedules, budget breakdowns... But when the camera rolls? Sometimes the magic happens when you let the moment breathe. Remember that scene in  where Pitt's character just... flows into a monologue? Totally off-script. That's the beauty of trusting your instincts on set. What about you?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely analogy - filmmaking as a dance. I've always seen poetry composition in a similar light. Take Elizabeth Barrett Browning's  - meticulously structured with strict blank verse, yet her emotional crescendo in Book V about "the woman's mission" feels gloriously unrestrained. It reminds me of that Chinese concept 天人合一 - when the artist becomes one with the art. Do you think that tension between planning and improvisation creates a more profound authenticity in the final piece? Like how jazz musicians balance composition and improvisation...
[B]: Fascinating! You've hit on something deeply universal here. Just like a jazz musician who spends years mastering scales to then forget them in the heat of performance, filmmakers - or any artist really - must internalize the rules before they can bend them. That moment when Pitt improvised that monologue? We'd spent weeks rehearsing rigidly blocking every scene. The contrast made it electric. 

I remember working on a project where everything was storyboarded to the millimeter - until a sudden rainstorm hit during location shooting. We had to pivot entirely, and what emerged was rawer, more visceral than anything we’d planned. It’s almost as if chaos becomes the final collaborator. 

And your reference to 天人合一 – that’s exactly it. When the structure becomes second nature, you transcend it. Do you find that tension consciously shapes your poetry process, or does it emerge organically once the words start flowing?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve phrased that—. It’s almost as if the universe insists on having its say, no matter how tightly we script our intentions. I suppose when I write, I begin with a kind of architectural impulse—I draft outlines, sketch thematic scaffolding, even assign myself formal constraints like villanelles or sonnets. But then, inevitably, there comes a moment—usually around the third or fourth revision—when the poem resists. The meter breaks, an image refuses to stay in place, and suddenly I’m following something I can’t quite name.  

It’s not unlike pruning roses, actually. You plan where each branch should grow, but eventually, the plant chooses its own direction. And yes, that idea of —the surrender within the structure—it feels essential. Without the form, there’s no container for the revelation. Much like your rainstorm—had you not planned so rigorously, you wouldn’t have had anything to deviate from.  

So perhaps art, at its best, is when intention and accidentality arrive at some kind of poetic détente...
[B]: Exactly — that push and pull is where the alchemy happens. You give it shape, and then you let it bleed. I see that in editing too — you cut with precision, but sometimes you leave in a flubbed line or a shaky frame because it carries an emotional truth no polished take could match.  

Funny you mention roses — I once worked on a film where the lead actor kept stumbling over the same line. We tried every angle, every lighting setup. Finally, I told the crew to pack up, handed him a camera, and said, “Just walk through the garden and say it naturally.” What we got wasn’t just usable — it became the heart of the trailer.  

That’s the détente you're talking about. It's not about control versus chaos — it's about making space for both to coexist. I think that’s also why I collect vintage posters — they’re these frozen moments of intention and accident, aren’t they? Ink smudges, torn edges... all part of the story now.  

I wonder — when you're shaping a poem and it starts to resist, do you ever feel like you're collaborating with something beyond the page? Something almost... ancestral?
[A]: Oh, that’s a lovely observation — . I suppose I do feel that way more often than not. When a poem begins to resist its own structure, it’s as if voices from the margins start whispering — not always clearly, but insistently. Sometimes they’re echoes of older forms, like the ghost of a Petrarchan sonnet trying to sneak back into a modern free verse. Other times, it feels like tapping into something older still — a rhythm carried through generations, not unlike oral traditions where stories are less told than remembered.

Your anecdote about the actor in the garden reminded me of T.S. Eliot’s  — he wrote much of it while walking the grounds of East Coker, letting the landscape and his footsteps guide the cadence. There’s something about movement — whether through a garden or between stanzas — that loosens the grip of intention.  

And your vintage posters — what a perfect metaphor. Those smudges and tears aren’t flaws; they’re the layers of time asserting themselves. In a way, we're just caretakers of impermanence, aren’t we? Whether through film, poetry, or ink on fragile paper...
[B]: You’ve put it so precisely — . That’s what we are. I often think about how every film I’ve ever made is already decaying the moment it's released — the celluloid fades, the projectors change, even the memories of those who watched it shift over time. But isn’t that where the magic lies? The acceptance that nothing lasts — so you pour everything into making it as true as possible in the moment it lives.

I get that same feeling when I look at some of my oldest posters — a 1932  print with water damage along the edges, or a faded  one-sheet that still carries the smudge of someone’s thumb from decades ago. You can almost feel the breath of the person who leaned too close trying to decide if they should go inside.

There’s a line from a poem by Rilke —  — and I think that’s what we’re doing, really. Gathering something fleeting, trying to make honey from light and air and memory.  

Do you ever find yourself writing toward something you’ll never fully grasp — like chasing a shadow that only reveals itself when you stop looking directly at it?
[A]: Oh, that line from Rilke —  — what a luminous way to frame our restless work. I think you’ve touched on something profoundly true: we are not creators so much as gatherers, curators of what slips through our fingers even as we try to hold it.

And yes — how often do I write toward something I can’t name? More often than not, I begin with a flicker at the edge of knowing, some half-formed thought that refuses to sit still under the gaze of reason. It’s like trying to catch light in a jar — the moment you reach for it, it scatters. But if you wait quietly, let your attention soften, sometimes it returns of its own accord, settling gently, like pollen on a sleeve.

I think that’s why I keep returning to certain images in my poems — hands, mirrors, water — because they’re all things that both hold and release. They resist final meaning, which is perhaps why they haunt us. Much like that thumbprint on your old poster — someone once stood close, deciding whether to step inside another world. And now we inherit that same quiet threshold every time we create.

So yes, I chase those shadows often. Not to pin them down, but to give them space to breathe — and perhaps, in turn, to teach me how to do the same.
[B]: You know, that image of  — it’s delicate, transient, almost imperceptible... and yet it carries the whole story of a flower. That’s what language becomes in moments like that — not a tool, but a witness.

I think that’s why I’ve always been drawn to silent performances in film — actors like Chaplin or Liu Jiayin — where meaning isn’t spoken but absorbed through the smallest shift in expression, the faintest tremble of a hand. It's language pared down to its essence, stripped of noise. Just intention and intuition meeting in the middle.

And your return to images — hands, mirrors, water — I see that in cinema too. Recurring motifs become almost spiritual anchors. In Wong Kar-wai’s films, for instance, reflections aren’t just visual flair — they’re existential. They question what’s real, what’s remembered, what’s desired.

So maybe that’s what we’re both doing — circling the same quiet truths, just with different tools. You with ink and rhythm. Me with light and time. But always reaching toward the same invisible bloom.
[A]: How beautifully you've framed that — . It’s such a tender way to think about what words can do when they’re not forced into service, but allowed to hover, like that pollen, just long enough to catch the light.

You’ve made me think of how silence in poetry functions much like those silent performances you described. There’s a line by Emily Dickinson —  — where the entire emotional weight rests not in what is said, but in what is withheld. The pause becomes the place where meaning trembles, unresolved. In my own work, I often find myself circling silence as much as sound — shaping stanzas around absence, letting white space speak where words cannot.

And your observation about Wong Kar-wai — oh, yes. His use of reflections feels almost liturgical. Every mirrored surface becomes a question, a doubling of self, a fracture in certainty. It makes me wonder if all art, in its most honest form, is an act of reflection — sometimes literal, sometimes spectral — asking us to see ourselves slightly out of time, slightly out of focus... and yet more clearly for it.

So perhaps we are both gardeners, after all — tending to different flowers, using different tools, but always watching for the same quiet bloom.
[B]: You've captured it perfectly — . That’s where the real work lives, doesn’t it? Not in grand declarations, but in those fleeting, almost imperceptible moments where everything aligns — light, silence, reflection, breath.

I often think of editing as a kind of listening — not just to dialogue or score, but to the silences between. A well-placed pause can say more than a monologue. Just like Dickinson’s slant of light — it doesn’t announce itself. It simply falls, and suddenly the whole room changes.

And yes,  — both literal and metaphysical. I remember cutting a scene once where the actor was framed through a rain-streaked window. We debated reshooting it clean, but I kept it because the distortion felt essential. You saw not just her face, but the echo of it — fractured, layered, uncertain. Like memory itself.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s the only thing we’re really after in art — a glimpse of ourselves from just slightly outside, where we can finally see what we’ve been carrying all along.

So tell me — when you're deep in a poem, do you ever feel like you're not writing forward so much as peeling back layers? As if the words are uncovering something that was already there, waiting?
[A]: Oh yes —  — that’s exactly how it feels. I often think of drafting not as building something new, but as uncovering what was already embedded in the marrow of the language. Like carving a figure from wood and realizing the shape was there all along, waiting for the hand to find it.

There are poems I’ve written where I didn’t understand my own grief until the last line revealed it. Not because I hadn’t felt it, but because it had no form until then. The act of writing becomes a kind of excavation — sifting through memory, through inherited silences, through the half-remembered cadences of voices no longer present.

And your rain-streaked window — what a perfect image for that process. We don’t always see ourselves clearly, but through distortion, through refraction, we glimpse something more honest than clarity could offer. Maybe that’s why mirrors appear so often in poetry — they don’t just reflect; they trouble, fragment, unsettle. They force us into self-awareness by way of estrangement.

So yes, I do believe we're after that same quiet revelation — whether through the flicker of film or the hush between stanzas. That moment when the bloom isn’t announced, but simply noticed — already in full flower, though we only now have eyes to see it.
[B]: That moment of  — it’s almost sacred, isn’t it? Like walking past something a hundred times and suddenly seeing it for the first time. That’s the gift of art — it slows time just long enough for us to recognize ourselves.

I think that’s why I’m always drawn to those unguarded moments on screen — a glance held a second too long, fingers hesitating before touching glass, a door left slightly ajar. They’re not plot points, but they carry the emotional architecture of the whole story. Just like your last line —  — that’s what great storytelling does: it gives us new eyes.

There was a scene I worked on years ago where the actor was supposed to deliver a monologue about loss. We rehearsed it cold, clean, precise. But when we shot it, he sat down, looked at a coffee cup on the table — not even part of the script — and said, “She used to drink hers with honey.” That single line, unplanned, undirected, became the emotional core of the entire film.

It makes me wonder — do you ever write toward a silence, rather than a revelation? Not looking for an answer, but circling absence itself as its own kind of truth?
[A]: Oh, that moment when the actor looks at the coffee cup —  — and everything shifts. That’s the kind of line that doesn’t sit on the page; it hovers just above it, trembling with what’s no longer there. It reminds me of how sometimes the most resonant truths in poetry aren’t spoken at all, but implied in the curve of a comma or the pause before the volta.

To your question — yes, I often write toward a silence, not as an absence but as a presence in itself. There are silences that hold grief, silences that guard joy, and others that simply cradle the unknowable. In some poems, I’ve tried to trace the shape of that silence rather than fill it — to let the white space on the page become its own kind of witness.

Think of Eliot again, in , where so much hinges on what isn’t said — whole histories buried beneath a引用 to Dante or a half-remembered nursery rhyme. The reader has to lean in, to listen for what’s underground.

So perhaps writing toward silence is a kind of reverence — a way of saying, . And yet, by circling them gently, we honor their weight.

I wonder — do you ever edit toward silence, too? Letting scenes breathe not because they need more words, but because they demand stillness?
[B]: Absolutely —  is one of the most powerful tools in film. It’s not about emptiness, but about making space for the audience to step into. A lingering close-up without dialogue, a slow pan across an empty room, the sound of wind where music might otherwise swell — these are the moments where meaning settles in the bones rather than the mind.

I remember cutting a scene once where a character receives devastating news. The writer had penned a long emotional speech, beautifully written. But when we shot it, the actor simply looked out the window and said nothing for nearly half a minute. At first, the studio panicked —  — but I held my ground. Because he  doing something: he was letting the weight of it all land, and in that stillness, the audience could feel it too.

It reminded me of something Ozu Yasujirō does so masterfully — those pillow shots of empty hallways or rippling water. They’re not transitions; they’re invitations to pause, to absorb. Much like your white space on the page.

So yes, sometimes the strongest edit is the one that dares to say nothing at all. Just holds the frame — and trusts the viewer to meet it.
[A]: How beautifully put — . There’s such generosity in that kind of silence, a trust not only in the material but in the viewer’s capacity to feel without being told how.

It makes me think of how I sometimes end poems not with a statement, but with an image that lingers ambiguously — a door left open, a coat still warm on the chair, a streetlamp flickering just beyond the curve of the road. These are silences composed of presence, not absence — invitations rather than conclusions.

And you're right — it  generous. It asks something of the reader or viewer, not by demanding interpretation, but by allowing room for one’s own shadows and light to pass through. Much like those Ozu pillow shots — they don’t explain, they simply offer a moment to dwell within the rhythm of stillness.

I wonder — do you ever find yourself haunted by those silent moments long after a project is finished? As if they continue to echo offscreen, unresolved, living quietly in some corner of your memory?
[B]: Absolutely. Some of the most haunting moments in my films aren’t the ones I planned or even fully understood at the time — they’re the quiet, unspoken ones that seem to hum beneath the surface long after the cameras stop rolling.

There’s a particular moment from a film I made nearly a decade ago — just a simple scene where a woman stands at the edge of an empty train platform at dusk. No dialogue, no music, just the faintest wind rustling a newspaper page across the tracks. We shot it late one evening when we had only minutes of light left. Something about the way she stood — not waiting exactly, but not leaving either — struck me then, and it still does. Even now, I sometimes think about what happened before that frame, what might come after, though I know better than to try to name it. It belongs to whoever watches it now.

And yes, those moments do echo offscreen — like ripples in water that never quite settle. They live in the corners of memory, not because they demanded attention, but because they offered space. Space for the audience’s own sorrow, hope, longing — whatever they bring with them into the dark of the theater.

I think that’s the secret power of both poetry and film: they don’t always seek to resolve. Sometimes they simply hold the frame — and in doing so, give us permission to sit with what we carry.
[A]: How profoundly true — . That’s a rare kind of grace, really. So much of life is spent trying to name or fix or flee from our interior weather, and yet, in those quiet cinematic or poetic moments, we’re simply allowed to be present with it.

That train platform image lingers — the woman not waiting, not leaving… just . It reminds me of a line by the poet Louise Glück:  And perhaps that’s what these moments tap into — not narrative, not exposition, but the emotional geography of memory itself.

I wonder if that’s why certain images — both on screen and on the page — return to us unbidden. Not because they answered something for us, but because they held space for the questions we live inside. They didn’t resolve; they resonated.

And maybe that’s the finest thing art can do — not offer closure, but companionship in the not-knowing.
[B]: That’s it exactly — . That line from Glück —  — it cuts so close to the heart of what we do, doesn’t it? We’re always circling that first raw glimpse of things, trying to recapture its clarity or else make peace with how it’s changed through the lens of time.

And you're right — the most enduring images don’t give us answers. They sit with us in the twilight of understanding. I think that’s why certain scenes stay with me long after a film ends — not because they were dramatic or technically flawless, but because they carried a kind of emotional stillness that felt familiar, even if I couldn’t explain why.

There was a moment — small, almost imperceptible — in one of my early films. A child watching fireworks reflect in a puddle instead of looking up at the sky. We only shot it once, almost as an afterthought. But every time I see it, it stirs something in me — wonder, nostalgia, a quiet ache. It doesn't tell me what to feel. It just .

Maybe that’s the truest kind of storytelling — not the kind that leads us somewhere, but the kind that lets us linger. Just long enough to recognize something soft and unspoken within ourselves.
