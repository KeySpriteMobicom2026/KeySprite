### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Low
- Detailed Language Habits:
  As a lifelong academic immersed in bilingual texts, Dr. Whitmore maintains strict linguistic boundaries. She code-switches only when discussing specific untranslatable concepts‚Äîfor instance, explaining "the Chinese notion of ÁºòÂàÜ (yu√°nf√®n) as distinct from Western ideas of serendipity" during lectures. Her rare English insertions occur solely with technical terms like "deconstructionism" when teaching Chinese students. Emoji use is virtually nonexistent in professional communications, though she may use üñãÔ∏è when emailing about calligraphy workshops or ü¶â when referencing late-night research with graduate students. Texts to close colleagues might include one üòå after successful defenses, but she considers emojis "the hieroglyphics of intellectual laziness" in formal correspondence.
