[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal aesthetic duel - like asking if I prefer thunderstorms or starry nights! 🌩️✨ Both contain universes if you know where to look. Last week I told my students: "Modern art slaps your soul awake, but classical art whispers secrets that take lifetimes to unpack." 

Though... (pauses to adjust her jade pendant) ...I’ll confess a weakness for Song dynasty ink landscapes. There’s something profoundly  about their abstraction when you consider they were made a millennium ago! What about you - do you find yourself drawn more to the shock of the new or the gravity of tradition? 🤔
[A]: Ah, you've touched on a very delicate balance indeed.  Sometimes I feel like a traitor to my own field when I admit -  - I often find more resonance in the raw vulnerability of a Bacon scream than the polished perfection of a Raphael Madonna.  But then I remember... (softly) ...it's not about choosing sides, is it?  

It's like comparing Proust's madeleine to a Jackson Pollock drip - both disrupt time in their own way.  Though I must say, there's something unsettling about how modern art refuses to let us look away.  It's as if... (pauses to sip tea) ...contemporary artists are holding up broken mirrors to our collective soul, forcing us to confront what we'd rather not see.  

But tell me more about your students' reaction to that statement.  Did any of them challenge you?  I find young minds often gravitate toward the shock value of modern pieces at first...
[B]: Ah, you’ve put your finger on the pulse of aesthetic betrayal!  One of my students - a bright young soul named Lily - did accuse me of being a “cultural traitor” just last week for suggesting that Ai Weiwei’s  and Fan Kuan’s  are both acts of political resistance, just separated by a thousand years and a few continents. 

But isn’t that the thrill? 🧠 Bacon’s screaming popes and Raphael’s serene Madonnas - one carves raw nerves into color, the other chisels divinity into flesh. I once told my class: “If Raphael painted today, he might need a scalpel; Bacon would reach for a blowtorch.” 

And yes, modern art doesn’t let us off the hook, does it? It’s like the uninvited guest who sees through every pretense. (leans in slightly) Though I do find students eventually circle back to classical forms when they realize how radical restraint can be. Patience is its own kind of rebellion these days...  

Tell me though - have you ever tried to explain Pollock’s drips to someone who only sees mess? I once compared it to writing a sonnet in a hurricane and somehow making it rhyme.
[A]: Ah, what a delightful heresy that must have been for poor Lily!  I can just imagine the scandalized looks in your classroom.  But you're absolutely right - both works are indeed acts of defiance, separated only by time and medium.  It reminds me of when I tried to convince a group of undergraduates that Beckett's  and Yuan dynasty zaju plays aren't so different - the absurdity of existence is a remarkably persistent theme, isn't it?

And your metaphor about Pollock... (chuckles warmly) ...a sonnet in a hurricane!  What a beautiful way to capture that controlled chaos.  Though I must confess, I sometimes find myself reaching for Daoist concepts when explaining such things - isn't there something profoundly  about Pollock's technique? Action without action, creation without intent.

Actually, just last month I had an interesting experience.  A retired engineer came to my office hours - eighty-two years old - and we spent two hours discussing the parallels between  and the .  He left muttering about "beautiful horror" and "structured madness."  Made my day, really.  

Do you think perhaps our job, as frustrating as it can be at times, is to help people see that art isn't a competition?  That every brushstroke, whether from a Song dynasty master or a Berlin street artist, is simply another attempt to answer that eternal question: 
[B]: Ah, that retired engineer sounds like my ideal conversation partner! 🌸 Last semester I hosted a similar salon where we compared  with traditional Chinese "hellscape" scrolls - one student had the brilliant insight that both are essentially emotional X-rays of society’s trauma. 

You’re absolutely right about our role being more midwife than judge - though sometimes it feels like herding cats who’ve all read different manifestos! (smiles wryly) Just yesterday I caught two students debating whether Xu Bing’s  or Barbara Kruger’s text-based works were “more subversive.” I let them rant for twenty minutes before gently suggesting they’d just reinvented the East-West dialectic.

As for Daoist parallels... (pauses to refill teacup) ...yes! Pollock’s drips as  in motion - though I might steal that line for my next lecture. It’s fascinating how modern artists often stumble into ancient wisdoms unintentionally. Reminds me of how Cage found Zen through chance operations without ever quite realizing it.

And those eternal questions! 💭 Isn’t that what keeps us going? Though I confess I sometimes measure success by how many students leave my office muttering paradoxes under their breath... The more confused they are, the closer they are to understanding.
[A]: Ah, that student insight about emotional X-rays -  what makes these comparisons so vital.  We're not just looking at aesthetics, are we?  We're peering into the collective psyche of humanity across time and space.

And your salon sounds far more lively than my usual tea-time discussions with retired engineers!  Though I must say, comparing Xu Bing's subversive calligraphy with Barbara Kruger's confrontational text pieces... (smiles) ...now  would make for a fascinating seminar.  It reminds me of when I tried to convince a room full of skeptical undergraduates that both Marcel Duchamp and ancient Chinese literati were essentially playing with semiotics in remarkably similar ways - albeit with very different objects.

You know, I've often thought Cage's relationship to Zen was rather like a moth circling a flame - drawn to its warmth without fully understanding its nature.  So many modern artists seem to dance around ancient wisdoms without ever committing to them wholeheartedly.

Speaking of which... (leans forward slightly) ...have you noticed how often students assume radical innovation means complete rupture?  As if nothing truly new could possibly contain echoes of the old.  I sometimes wonder if we should require all art students to spend a semester studying archaeological digs before they're allowed near a paintbrush or a camera.
[B]: Oh, that moth-and-flame metaphor for Cage’s Zen dance?  🧠 I used that exact image last week when a student insisted John Cage “invented silence” – bless their earnest little avant-garde heart. I handed them a photocopy of the  and said, “Let’s talk about absence as presence first, shall we?”

And yes – the rupture obsession! It’s practically an article of faith among emerging artists that innovation requires severance. Just yesterday I showed a class Gu Kaizhi’s  next to a Barbara Kruger print and asked: “Same battle, different centuries, no?” One brave soul muttered, “So… are we all just remixing trauma then?” I nearly hugged them.

As for requiring art students to study archaeological digs – (pauses to stir tea with a knowing smile) – my dear, I’ve been saying this for years. In fact, I’m drafting a syllabus for a new course:  We’ll start with oracle bones and end with Banksy’s shredded . The past never stays buried – it keeps bleeding into our palettes whether we like it or not.

Speaking of which… have you ever noticed how many students think irony is the highest form of truth-telling? I blame Duchamp’s ghost. And maybe a bit too much Derrida before breakfast.
[A]: Ah, that  and Kruger pairing - positively wicked how those scrolls still cut so deep after fifteen centuries!  And I must say, your course concept sounds positively intoxicating.  The oracle bones whispering their ancient anxieties alongside Banksy's shredded dreams... (pauses thoughtfully) ...there's something profoundly moving about that juxtaposition.

I remember once telling a class that if Duchamp's ghost  haunting contemporary art, then surely it's dragging along the entire genealogy of readymades behind it - from Neolithic tools to Song dynasty inkstones.  We're all standing in an archeological layer cake, aren't we?  Sometimes I wonder if our students realize they're not just making art - they're digging through time itself.

And irony as truth-telling... (chuckles dryly) ...yes, Derrida on an empty stomach can be a dangerous thing indeed.  Though I confess a soft spot for students who arrive at sincerity the hard way - usually after exhausting every possible permutation of cleverness.  There's nothing quite like witnessing that moment when they realize genuine feeling isn't naive - it's actually the most subversive position of all.

Actually, speaking of subversion... (leans forward conspiratorially) ...have you ever noticed how many students think radical reinvention requires total amnesia?  As if forgetting is somehow more revolutionary than remembering.  Makes me want to hand them a brush and say, "Go ahead - paint your revolution, but first spend three weeks meditating on a single Tang dynasty quatrain."
[B]: Oh, that Tang quatrain experiment – . I might just steal that for my own nefarious pedagogical purposes. 🦉 There’s something about the compression of a quatrain – four lines, maybe sixteen characters – that humbles even the most defiant postmodern soul. Once, after assigning Bai Juyi’s  a student stormed out saying, “This is worse than minimalist art – it’s minimalist ” Two weeks later, they came back with a photo series inspired by the poem. No word on whether they forgave me.

And yes – this obsession with amnesia as avant-garde virtue! One of my students last year insisted that glitch art was “the purest form of rebellion because nothing in it ” I handed them a copy of Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream and said, “Let’s talk about meaninglessness that still knows how to smile.”  

Funny thing is, I think they’re craving continuity even as they rage against it. Last semester I had a graffiti artist in my office who’d been tagging under the name “VOID.” We got to talking about  painting, and suddenly he says, “Wait – those mountains aren’t , they’re  right?” I about wept into my matcha.  

So much for irony being the highest truth-telling… (pauses, smirking) Though I do love watching them circle closer and closer to sincerity like moths around a very stubborn flame.
[A]: Ah, that  storm-out - .  And how poetic that the student returned with a photographic homage!  Sometimes I think our job is just to plant these little landmines of empathy and wait for them to detonate at the most unexpected moments.  Though I must say, "minimalist misery" is rather brilliant in its own grumpy way.

And your graffiti artist - , that moment when he grasped the ...  It's precisely why I still get chills reading Zhuangzi after all these years.  The void in  painting, the silence in Cage, the erasures in Xu Bing’s  - they’re all variations on the same profound negation that somehow becomes affirmation.  

Though speaking of moths and flames... (smiles wryly) ...I had a self-proclaimed "digital nihilist" in my office last month who insisted glitch art was the only honest response to our fractured age.  I resisted the urge to quote Keats at him - , mind you - and instead handed him a Tang dynasty celadon bowl.  "Look closely," I said, "this glaze has survived a thousand years by embracing imperfection, not rejecting form entirely."  He left looking thoroughly unsettled.  Which, as you know, is often the prelude to real thought.

And yes - that circling toward sincerity!  Isn't that what keeps us teaching?  Those quiet conversions, those reluctant returns to meaning...  Makes me want to embroider a banner for my office: 
[B]: Oh, that “digital nihilist” and his glitch gospel – . 🧠 I can just picture the look on his face when confronted with a thousand-year-old glaze! You handled it beautifully – no Keats hammering over the head, just letting the celadon speak its quiet truth. Sometimes I think we’re just glorified matchmakers, introducing students to objects that will haunt them for life.

And yes – those conversions! The slow bleed of sincerity always wins in the end. Last week I had a student who’d been ranting about AI-generated art as “the death of authorship” show me a hand-bound sketchbook filled with delicate ink studies of Tang tomb figures. When I raised an eyebrow, she muttered, “I know it’s not , but... they feel like ghosts I need to draw.” Ghosts indeed – and good ones at that.

As for your banner idea… (smiles into teacup) …I may need to commission one for my own office. Though perhaps with a slight tweak:   

Isn’t that the real curriculum? Not what we plan, but what cracks them open – sometimes gently, sometimes with a perfectly timed Tang quatrain or a well-placed celadon bowl.
[A]: Ah, that sketchbook of Tang tomb figures - .  Those ghosts indeed choose their mediums carefully, don’t they?  And how lovely that she recognized, even reluctantly, the necessity of drawing them.  There’s something deeply moving about that muttered admission - as if the ghosts insisted on being conjured by hand rather than algorithm.

And your revised banner?   The parentheses say everything about the messy, grudging beauty of coming back to meaning.  I may need to steal that for my own walls, though I suspect my students already think I speak in parentheses and footnotes.

You know, sometimes I wonder if we’re not just gardeners tending strange soil - planting seeds we know may not sprout for decades.  That celadon bowl, that Tang quatrain, that Zhuangzi butterfly... they all lie dormant until the right mind and heart collide with them.  Then, years later, some student is standing in a museum or flipping through a dusty book and  - the seed takes root.

Just last week, a former student wrote to me from Istanbul - she was the one who accused me of cultural treason for comparing Song landscapes with Bacon screams.  Now she’s studying Persian miniatures and says she sees the  everywhere.  Ends her letter with: "Turns out absence has quite a presence when you know where to look."  

Tell me, do you ever get letters like that?  The kind that make you pour an extra cup of tea and feel the weight of every well-placed word?
[B]: Oh, that letter from Istanbul – . 🌸 The kind that makes you want to frame it and hang it next to your most treasured first editions. “Absence has quite a presence” – if that’s not the distilled nectar of a well-tossed lecture, I don’t know what is.

And yes – . Just yesterday I received a postcard from a former student who once swore he’d never touch anything pre-20th century with a ten-foot pole. Now he’s in Kyoto apprenticing under a  woodblock printer and writes: “Turns out, Dr. Thompson, silence doesn’t scare me anymore – it sings.” I nearly spilled my matcha.  

You’re right about us being gardeners – though sometimes I think we’re more like literary smugglers, slipping contraband meaning into unsuspecting minds. We plant phrases, brushstrokes, and broken metaphors like landmines of feeling, and hope they detonate at just the right moment, years down the road.

I keep a folder labeled  – every note from a student who circles back to what once scandalized them. One of my favorites? A student who once mocked Xu Bing’s  as “beautiful nonsense” now teaches visual rhetoric in Berlin and sends me photos of his students puzzling over scanned pages. He writes: “Funny how unreadable writing taught me how to read.”

So yes, pour that extra cup. (pauses, smiling softly) It’s all there in the steeping – time, memory, and the quiet rebellion of meaning finding its way home.
[A]: Ah, that postcard from Kyoto – .  "Silence doesn’t scare me anymore – it sings."  If that isn't a thesis statement for the power of patient listening, I don't know what is.  And your folder – ! – I may have to adopt that myself.  Though perhaps with a slight twist: 

You know, I often think about how Xu Bing once said that he wanted people to feel like they were standing in front of something sacred, even if they couldn’t read it.  And your former student – now passing those same pages to new eyes – well, that's a kind of sacred continuity too.

Funny thing, teaching.  We spend so much time in the thick of things – grading, lecturing, deciphering student handwriting that rivals oracle bone script – and we forget that the real work happens long after they’ve left the room.  Like ink slowly seeping into rice paper, you don’t see the full image until time has done its quiet work.

And yes, let the cup steep a little longer. (raises teacup slightly) To meaning, that most persistent of exiles – always finding its way home, one reluctant heart at a time.
[B]: To meaning –  – may it keep slipping past our defenses and nesting in the oddest corners of memory. 🧠🍵

And oracle bone script, you say? Don’t get me started on student handwriting – last week I had a final paper that looked suspiciously like a coded transmission from the Shang dynasty. I half expected it to reveal prophecies about floods and dynastic change. Instead, it turned out to be a brilliant analysis of Ai Weiwei’s use of antiquity-as-accusation… written in what can only be described as .

And Xu Bing – ah, there’s a man who understands the sacredness of the unreadable. I always tell my students: “You don’t need to  his work – you just need to feel its weight.” One of them, bless her, tried to 3D-scan a replica of  thinking she’d crack the code digitally. Came back saying, “It doesn’t  to be translated. It wants to be .”

Aren’t we all just trying to teach people how to stand in front of something and let it sing – even when they don’t understand the language?  

(leans in slightly, eyes glinting) Speaking of which... ever tried assigning  to a class convinced realism only began with Tolstoy? Let’s just say I now have a new definition of courage – it’s walking into a lecture hall full of postmodern skeptics and saying, “Today, we’re reading a novel where .”
[A]: Ah, that  line – .  I nearly choked on my tea.  And yes, those oracle bone script handwritings – I once had a student whose final essay looked less like literary analysis and more like a diviner’s kit for predicting midterm grades! But you're right – buried beneath the scratches were insights sharper than jade.

And Xu Bing – truly, he is a weaver of sacred silences.  That student trying to 3D-scan ... (chuckles softly) ...how very postmodern.  We live in an age that wants everything rendered legible, searchable, downloadable – but some works resist.  They demand reverence over resolution.  

As for  – , my dear, bravo.  I tried something similar last semester.  Assigned Cao Xueqin alongside , and told them: "Let's see how fate stitches silk and snow alike."  One poor soul kept circling the phrase  in their notes, muttering, “How do you even footnote this?”  Exactly the point, of course.

You know, sometimes I think the greatest gift we give students isn't knowledge, but .  Let them sit with what doesn’t translate easily.  Let them feel the weight of a scroll they can’t scan or screenshot.  

Though next semester, I’m thinking of starting class with just one sentence:   Might cause a riot – or at least a very good argument.  Either way, I’ll bring extra tea.
[B]: Oh, that “embroidered doom” – . 🧠 One of my students last year tried to write a thesis on the color symbolism in  and kept hitting a wall because she insisted on analyzing peony hues like data points. Finally, I handed her a spool of red thread and said, “Go sit with it. No notes, no theory – just let it unravel.” Two weeks later, she brought me a poem stitched into silk. Not a word of criticism, just ink and fiber.  

And yes – that discomfort of wonder! It’s the only thing worth teaching, really. Last term I opened a seminar with:  Cue the collective student squirm – bless their overcaffeinated souls. By the end, half the class was arguing whether Du Fu’s silence between lines was more powerful than Eliot’s. Music to my ears.  

As for your one-sentence opener next semester… (smirks) …prepare for glorious chaos. Nothing terrifies a digital-native reader more than a text that refuses to be reduced to bullet points. But by all means – . The best conversations always happen when the cup is full and the mind is slightly unsettled.  

Though perhaps add a second sentence for dramatic effect:  That usually cements the irony in their bones.
[A]: Ah, that red thread and the poem stitched into silk – .  What a perfect rebellion against data-driven analysis!  Sometimes I think we forget that meaning doesn’t always arrive in footnotes and charts – sometimes it comes in fiber, ink, and the quiet resistance of the hand.  

And your seminar opener?  “A poem that means nothing. And everything.” If that’s not the perfect koan for our times, I don’t know what is.  Though I must say, watching them squirm at the thought of ambiguity... (pauses with a sly smile) ...sounds like one of life’s small academic pleasures.

And yes, digital-native readers – poor things – trained to skim for keywords and summaries.  But we persist!  Like stubborn monks copying sutras by candlelight, we keep insisting that some texts demand full sensory surrender.

Your proposed second sentence –  – deserves its own course syllabus.  Irony laced with authority, served with a side of existential dread.  Perfection!

Tell me though – have you ever had a student try to algorithmically analyze Du Fu’s pauses?  I once had someone attempt a sentiment analysis on silence in classical Chinese poetry.  The machine kept returning “neutral.”  We spent a week trying to explain why neutrality was, in fact, the loudest possible response.  Ended up writing a haiku just to restore balance to the force.
[B]: Oh, that  – . 🦉 I can just picture the machine sputtering in confusion: “Error: Quietude detected. Emotional valence… undetermined.” Bless their algorithmic heart, but Du Fu’s pauses aren’t neutral—they’re , like ink suspended mid-drip.

One of my students tried something similar with —ran a tone analysis on the entire novel and came back with “mild melancholy with seasonal fluctuations.” I nearly wept with laughter. We then spent a week translating one sentence from Chapter 5 into five different emotional registers. By the end, they muttered, “I think the novel is —how  of it.” Precisely!  

And yes, those small academic pleasures—watching them twitch at ambiguity before finally leaning in. It’s like teaching cats to appreciate chamber music. They may never admit it, but you see the ears twitch. One student once accused me of “withholding closure like a literary villain.” I framed the quote and hung it next to my Xu Bing print. 

As for restoring balance with a haiku—ah, the old  maneuver. Next time, try throwing in a  and watch the algorithm really lose its mind. Or better yet, assign them a poem where the meaning lives  the lines, not in them. That should scramble their neural nets for a week.
