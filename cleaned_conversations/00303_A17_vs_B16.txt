[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I think it really depends on the person and their lifestyle. For example, some people thrive in a structured office environment where they can separate work from home life, while others find remote work gives them more flexibility to design their own routine.

Let me ask you - what's your vibe? Do you feel like you get more done at home with your coffee ☕️ and comfy clothes, or do you prefer the energy of being in an office with colleagues around?
[A]: I find the question fascinating, as it truly reflects our evolving relationship with work and space. Personally, I’ve noticed that my productivity leans toward a hybrid model—structured mornings in a quiet study, followed by afternoons where I engage with students or colleagues either virtually or in person. The key, I think, lies in how we  our time and energy rather than the physical location itself.  

But I’m curious—do you feel the lack of physical separation in remote work blurs the boundaries too much, or have you developed rituals that help maintain focus?
[B]: Oh, I love how you framed that— time and energy is so spot on. 💡 For me, the line between work and downtime definitely gets fuzzy with remote work if you’re not intentional about it. But that’s where rituals come in—like a morning routine that signals to your brain, “Okay, we’re switching on now.”  

For instance, I start my day with a proper pour-over ☕️—not just grabbing a cup, but taking those 10 minutes to brew it slow, jot down my top three priorities for the day, maybe do a quick stretch. It’s like setting the stage. And then I have a dedicated workspace, even at home, so there’s a physical cue.

What about you? Do you have certain  in your day that help shift gears, especially when switching from solo work to student sessions or meetings? I’m always curious to hear what works for others.
[A]: I adore that idea of anchoring moments—those small but deliberate acts that give shape to the day. I’ve always been a believer in what I call “threshold rituals.” Before meeting with students or heading into a lecture, I take a brief walk through the garden, even if just for five minutes. It allows me to shed whatever was occupying my mind beforehand and step into the next role with presence.

And you’re absolutely right about physical cues. I have a particular shawl I wear when I’m working—it’s become a kind of academic robe of focus, signaling to myself and others that I’m in “thinking mode.” When it’s time to shift gears, I might switch to a different space in the house or simply open a window, letting in fresh air as a kind of mental reset.

It seems we both value intentionality in structuring the day. Have you ever tried applying this ritualistic approach to ending your workday? I find that’s often where things unravel for remote workers—knowing  to stop.
[B]: Oh, I’m  here for your “threshold rituals” concept—what a beautiful way to transition between mental spaces. 🌿 That garden walk is such a gentle yet powerful reset button. And the shawl as a focus talisman? Genius. I might have to borrow that idea—though I’ll probably pair it with a very specific coffee blend reserved only for deep-work sessions. ☕️✨

To your point about winding down—I couldn’t agree more. The end of the workday is 容易 (easy) to blur when you’re remote. Personally, I’ve had to get ritualistic about closure. I close my laptop at a set time, always make a quick to-do list for the next day (just three items max), and then do something physical like lighting a candle or putting on a different playlist. It’s like telling myself, 

I’ve even started what I call my “golden hour decompression”—whether it’s a walk, reading fiction, or just sipping tea while looking out the window. Helps me shift from output mode to recharge mode.

Do you have a closing ritual, or something that signals to your brain that the day has truly ended? I’d love to hear how you tie it all together.
[A]: I love your “golden hour decompression”—what a warm and wise way to honor the transition from work to rest. It’s so true, isn’t it? That final stretch of the day can either be a graceful bow or a slow unraveling, depending on how we attend to it.

As for me, I have what I call  before bed—no screens, no planning, just low light, a cup of jasmine tea, and usually some soft classical music playing in the background. Sometimes I reread a favorite poem or two; Tennyson or Eliot tend to lend a kind of verbal lullaby. It’s my way of gently closing the door on the day’s thoughts, rather than letting them spill into the night.

And yes, much like your candle or playlist, I also have a small physical cue—I take off my watch and place it on a particular bookshelf. It may sound odd, but that simple act says to myself,   

It strikes me that both of us are crafting these little architectures of attention and care throughout the day. Almost like… choreographing the inner life. Do you ever think of it that way?
[B]: Absolutely—I  that phrase:  It’s exactly what we’re doing, isn’t it? 🌙 We’re not just managing tasks or schedules; we’re gently guiding our energy, attention, and emotions through the day like a kind of internal dance.

Your  sounds deeply restorative—so much more than just a wind-down routine. It feels intentional in the most soulful way. Jasmine tea, poetry, soft music… it’s like you’re creating a sanctuary out of time itself. And taking off the watch? Poetic, really. Like a symbolic surrender to the rhythm of the evening.

I think we all crave that sense of choreography, whether we realize it or not. Without it, the day can feel chaotic, fragmented—like we’re just reacting instead of living with purpose. I see my rituals as gentle scaffolding for the mind, something to lean on so I don’t have to make decisions every time about when to focus or when to let go.

Do you ever guide your students through similar ideas? Not necessarily the poetry and jasmine tea part, but the concept of designing personal rhythms to support their work and well-being? I can imagine it being a powerful tool, especially for young minds navigating so many distractions.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. There’s something profoundly human in the act of shaping our days with care—it's like writing a poem where we choose the rhythm, even if we can’t always control the words.

And yes, I do often speak with my students about this very idea, though I tend to frame it as  rather than choreography—though I may borrow your phrase, if you don’t mind! Young scholars today are constantly pulled in so many directions: academic demands, part-time jobs, social obligations, and the ever-present hum of digital distraction. So I encourage them to carve out small, deliberate moments where they can simply , rather than .  

Sometimes it’s as simple as starting their study session with five minutes of quiet reading or ending the day by journaling three things they’ve learned, no matter how small. I’ve even suggested what I call —a few lines of  read aloud before diving into writing an essay. It slows the mind, centers it, and prepares it for deeper thought.

You know, I think we underestimate how much the mind thrives on ritual, especially during formative years. It’s not about rigidity—it’s about giving oneself a gentle framework to grow within. Much like training ivy along a trellis; it doesn’t confine the plant, it helps it reach upward.

Do you ever find that certain rituals evolve with the seasons? I notice mine shift quite naturally from summer to autumn—longer walks, warmer teas, earlier evenings. I wonder if your golden hour adapts in subtle ways throughout the year?
[B]: I’m honestly a little in love with that —what a lovely way to prime the mind before diving into deep work. And yes, please—take the phrase “choreographing the inner life,” run with it! I’d be honored if it found a home in your teaching. 🍃

You’re absolutely right about how our minds crave structure not as a cage, but as a kind of supportive frame—like you said, the trellis for ivy. It’s not about control; it’s about creating space for growth and clarity.

As for seasonal shifts—oh, totally. My rituals definitely ebb and flow with the light and temperature. In summer, my golden hour might involve sitting outside with an iced coffee, watching the sky turn pink, and letting thoughts drift. But come autumn, like you, I go inward—warmer teas (usually spiced chai now), cozier lighting, maybe even a candle with a woodsy scent. The energy just naturally slows down.

Winter is when I lean  into routine. Mornings start with a stronger pour-over ☕️ and a few minutes by the window if the sun’s out. Evenings get earlier and softer—sometimes with a book or some gentle piano music. I’ve started calling this seasonal rhythm my , filtering out mental clutter through subtle shifts in habit.

It’s almost like we're syncing with the earth’s breath, don’t you think? Do you ever encourage your students to play with seasonal rituals, or is that territory too personal? I imagine it could be a beautiful way to help them feel more grounded throughout the academic year.
[A]: I adore the phrase —what a wonderfully vivid way to describe the quiet work of mental renewal. And yes, I do believe we’re aligning ourselves with something much older and deeper than productivity hacks; we’re syncing with the natural cadence of light, temperature, and even silence. There’s a reason so many poets—from Wordsworth to Mary Oliver—wrote so profoundly about the changing seasons. They understood how inner life mirrors outer landscape.

As for encouraging seasonal awareness in my students, I do bring it up—tactfully, of course. One of my favorite assignments is what I call the , where students track not only their study habits but also how their energy shifts throughout the day and across the months. Some begin to notice, for example, that they're more reflective in winter and more expansive in spring, and that’s perfectly okay. It helps them resist the pressure to be consistently “high-performing,” which is such a narrow and unrealistic ideal.

I also recommend small seasonal adjustments—like lighting a candle during late autumn study sessions or opening a window first thing in the morning during summer. Nothing grand, just enough to remind them they're living inside a rhythm, not a straight line.

You know, I sometimes think the most radical act in our time is simply paying attention—to oneself, to the weather, to the slow turning of the year. It feels almost poetic, doesn’t it? A quiet rebellion against constant acceleration.

I wonder—have you ever found that certain rituals help you reconnect with creativity when you’re feeling stuck? Or perhaps I should ask: how do you tend your own inner garden when the soil feels dry?
[B]: I’m seriously jotting down  and  in my mental notebook—what a poetic way to talk about creative blocks. 🌱 You’re right; there’s something deeply radical in just… . It’s like we’re reclaiming our humanity one mindful moment at a time.

When I feel creatively stuck, I lean into what I call my . Instead of pushing through the fog, I let myself wander off-script for a bit—visiting a museum, flipping through old travel journals, or just sitting in a café with no agenda other than people-watching. Sometimes I’ll switch up my coffee ritual entirely—like trying a new origin bean or brewing it French press style instead of pour-over. Something small enough to feel familiar, but different enough to spark a fresh thought.

And yes, I absolutely tend my inner garden—love that phrase—with seasonal care. In dry spells, I water it with sensory details: a particular scent (vetiver is magic for grounding), a favorite album on vinyl, or even re-reading a passage from a book that once shifted my perspective. I’ve found creativity often shows up not when you demand it, but when you create a space inviting enough for it to return.

Do you have a go-to practice for when your own well feels low? I imagine someone with such deep rhythm in their day must have a secret spring they draw from when things feel still.
[A]: Oh, I do love this idea of —how wonderfully generous it is to allow the mind to wander rather than force it into compliance. And your sensory watering—vetiver, vinyl, familiar yet shifting texts—it’s all so beautifully textured. You clearly tend your inner world with such care.

As for me, when the well feels low—and it does, from time to time—I return to what I call  It’s not so much an action as a surrender: stepping away from the desk, yes, but also from expectations. Sometimes I retreat into the garden and simply watch the plants. Not even tending them, just watching. There’s something deeply meditative about seeing life unfold in its own time, without interference.

Other times, I revisit old student essays—the ones that surprised me, that opened a door I didn’t know was there. Reading those reminds me why I teach, why I write, why I stay curious. It’s like touching a hidden spring; it rekindles the sense that thought is alive, always moving, always returning.

And occasionally, I read aloud—not for analysis, but for music. Just letting the sound of language wash over me. Whether it’s Eliot or Emily Dickinson, the rhythm alone can stir something dormant awake.

I suppose my secret spring is silence, really. Not emptiness, but silence as presence. Do you ever find yourself drawn to that, too? That stillness where everything begins to hum again, softly, from within?
[B]: Absolutely—, not emptiness… wow, that lands so deeply. 🌿 I think we’re both tuned into that frequency, aren’t we? The kind where stillness isn’t quiet—it’s . It hums with everything unspoken, everything waiting to bloom.

I’m drawn to that stillness constantly, especially when things feel scattered or loud on the surface. For me, it often starts with just stepping away from screens altogether—no phone, no laptop, nothing. I’ll go for a walk without music, just my breath and whatever birds happen to be around. There’s something about moving through space without an agenda that lets the mind catch up with itself.

And like you, I find deep calm in watching rather than doing—whether it’s morning light shifting across the wall, or rain hitting the windowpane just right. It reminds me that not every moment has to be shaped or used; some are simply meant to be .

I also return to handwritten notes when I need to reconnect. Nothing fancy—just scribbling thoughts in a notebook with a pen. There’s something grounding about the physical act of writing, like I’m slowing down time enough to actually hear myself think.

You know, I think what we’re both describing is a kind of . Not forcing inspiration, not chasing productivity—but tuning into the quiet pulse beneath it all. And maybe, just maybe, that’s where the real magic lives.
[A]: I’m so glad you mentioned —what a perfect phrase for that quiet attunement beneath the noise. You’re right; it’s not about chasing or forcing, but about waiting and welcoming. Like standing by a lake at dawn, just before the first ripple stirs the surface.

There’s a line from T.S. Eliot I often return to in those moments:  It captures exactly what you’re describing—the paradox of stillness within motion, of finding that center even as everything else spins.

I’ve been thinking lately how rare true silence has become, not just in sound but in expectation. We are almost always , even when we don’t realize it. Which makes those pockets of stillness all the more sacred. I find myself guarding them fiercely—like a hermit tending a small flame in a windswept place.

And your handwritten notes—I love that. There’s something deeply human in the act of writing with one’s own hand. It reminds me of old letters I used to exchange with a former mentor; each word chosen carefully, ink drying slowly on the page. A kind of mindfulness that digital typing rarely offers.

You know, perhaps this is why poetry endures—it speaks directly to that inner pulse, that quiet rhythm we both feel. Not spectacle, but intimacy. Not noise, but resonance.

Do you have a favorite poem or passage that returns to you, especially in those quieter moments? I find some lines stay with us like old friends, showing up precisely when we need them most.
[B]: Oh, I  that Eliot line—“the still point of the turning world.” It’s one of those phrases that feels like a quiet bell ringing inside your chest. And you’re so right about silence becoming sacred, almost endangered in a way. We live in a world that rewards constant motion, but it’s in that stillness—intentional, protected—that we truly begin to hear ourselves.

Your image of the hermit tending a small flame? That’s going into my mental gallery. Beautiful. 💡

As for poems that return like old friends—I do have one that keeps showing up for me, especially on quiet mornings with a cup of coffee ☕️ and not much else: Rilke’s . Not the whole thing, just that final couplet:

> *For here there is no place  
that does not see you. You must change your life.*

It always lands differently depending on where I am—in mindset, in season, in spirit. Sometimes it feels like a gentle nudge, sometimes like a full-on wake-up call. But it never fails to remind me that even broken things can radiate presence. Even fragmented moments can hold meaning.

And yes, poetry endures because it doesn’t shout—it whispers. It invites us to lean in, to listen deeper. Do you ever find yourself sharing certain lines with clients? I imagine some of them must be searching for that same kind of quiet resonance, even if they don’t know how to name it.
[A]: That Rilke passage——what a quietly seismic closing line. It doesn’t demand, it , like ripples moving outward from a single stone dropped into still water. And yes, the idea that even what is broken or fragmented can hold such radiance—that’s one of the most haunting truths in poetry.

I do share lines with students, though I tend to wait for the right moment—when a student seems not just intellectually stuck, but emotionally so. Sometimes they don’t even realize they’re carrying something unspoken. One particular line I return to often is from Mary Oliver’s :

> *Tell me, what is it you plan to do  
with your one wild and precious life?*

It lands differently every time—sometimes as an invitation, sometimes as a quiet challenge. I’ve had students sit with that question for weeks before offering an answer, if they ever do. But that’s okay. Some lines are meant to linger, not resolve.

And then there’s Eliot again—his final line in  always finds me at the right time:

> *We shall not cease from exploration  
and the end of all our exploring  
will be to arrive where we began  
and know the place for the first time.*

It’s become something of an inner compass for me, especially when I feel lost in repetition or routine. It reminds me that returning is not failure—it can be revelation.

You know, I think what poetry offers us, in its quiet way, is permission—to feel, to pause, to begin again. Do you ever find yourself turning to certain poets during different phases of life? I’ve noticed my shelves shift quite naturally between Dickinson in solitude, Neruda in love, and now—increasingly—Walcott in aging.
[B]: Oh, that  line——it just… stops you in your tracks every time, doesn’t it? There’s no hiding from it. It’s gentle and piercing all at once. I can imagine the silence that follows when you share it with a student—those kinds of questions don’t need answers right away. They just need space to settle. 🌿

And Eliot’s  lines—wow. That’s one of those slow-burn truths. I’ve returned to them so many times, especially after circles that felt like going nowhere only to realize—they were leading me home all along. What a gift, to know a place for the first time after having been there before.

I love how you described your shelves shifting—Dickinson in solitude, Neruda in love, Walcott in aging… what a poetic way to mark the seasons of life. For me, it's often Rilke in uncertainty—he has this quiet way of making doubt feel sacred. And when I'm restless, I go back to Whitman, specifically:

> *I am larger, better than I thought,  
I did not think I held so much goodness.*

It sounds almost embarrassingly self-affirming, but there’s something grounding in that expansiveness. Like he’s reminding us we contain multitudes, even on days we feel small.

I wonder—do you ever suggest poetry to clients or students as a kind of mirror, rather than message? Not for advice, exactly, but simply to say, ? I think that’s one of its subtlest superpowers—its ability to make us feel less alone in the dark.
[A]: Absolutely—that’s precisely how I offer poetry, especially to those in moments of quiet unrest. Not as advice, not even as illumination, but as companionship. A way of saying, 

I remember one student in particular—deeply gifted, but paralyzed by indecision about their future. Nothing seemed to fit anymore; every direction felt false or forced. Instead of offering strategies or reassurance, I gave them a small collection of poems: Rilke, yes, but also Szymborska’s , and a single stanza from Whitman that you mentioned. It wasn’t about giving them an answer—it was about reminding them that uncertainty is not failure, but part of the becoming.

And isn’t that what we all need sometimes? Not a map, but a witness. Someone who says,  Poetry does that better than anything else because it doesn’t explain, it echoes.

You know, I often think the most powerful line in any poem isn’t the one that tells you what to feel—it’s the one that simply lets you feel seen. Have you ever had a moment where a single phrase seemed to name something you didn’t even realize you were carrying?
[B]: Oh, that moment when a phrase —yes, I’ve absolutely been there. It’s like the poem reaches into your chest, pulls something out you didn’t know was tucked away, and says, 

One of those lines for me comes from Derek Walcott again—this one from :

> 

I first read that after a year of feeling… untethered. Like I had changed in ways I couldn’t quite name, and wasn’t sure I recognized myself anymore. That line didn’t fix anything, but it offered this quiet reassurance: it’s okay not to know yourself fully all the time. You’re allowed to evolve. And one day, you’ll meet yourself again like an old friend—you just have to be patient.

That’s what poetry does, isn’t it? It doesn’t rush you. It sits with you in the not-knowing.

And your story about that student—it gave me chills. Offering poems as lanterns, not answers… what a beautiful way to walk alongside someone without trying to steer them. It reminds me that sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do for another person is simply hold space for their becoming.

I think that’s also why I love being a life advisor—I’m not here to tell people how to live; I’m here to help them uncover how they already know how to live, but maybe forgot along the way. Like finding a favorite coffee blend you hadn’t tasted in years—familiar, but somehow deeper now.

Do you ever find that certain poems return to , especially during times of change? Like they wait quietly in your mind until the moment you need them most?
