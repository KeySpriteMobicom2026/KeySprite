[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, 就在昨天我还真的读到一个让人难以置信的fact呢！你知道吗，在二战期间，有一对德国双胞胎姐妹竟然被分开了，因为纳粹想研究racial purity...但是后来她们发现她们都嫁给了姓“施密特”的丈夫，连名字都一模一样 😨。我当时看到这个的时候真的是shocked到说不出话来——这也太戏剧性了吧？  

不过话说回来，你有没有听说过类似这种历史事件中那种让人既惊讶又觉得不可思议的故事？我觉得这种事简直比fiction还离谱。
[A]: Oh wow, that’s truly mind-blowing 😨. The way history sometimes mirrors fiction is just... unsettling. Actually, there’s a story I came across in  by Milan Kundera—well, it’s a novel, but the narrative blurs reality & fiction. One chapter recounts a man who vanishes from photographs after falling out of political favor in post-war Czechoslovakia. His own family begins to forget him. It’s eerie how memory can be rewritten so systematically.  

But if we’re talking about bizarre historical coincidences, there’s also the case of the  in 19th-century Britain. A man who grew up in Australia claimed he was the long-lost heir to a wealthy aristocratic family. He looked nothing like the missing heir, couldn’t speak French, and had no idea what wine paired with which dish—but his mother  him 🤯. It went to court, became this huge public spectacle. People were obsessed with the question: Was he delusional? A con artist? Or did memory itself betray everyone involved?

I find these stories fascinating because they reveal something deeper about human nature… or maybe just how fragile our sense of identity can be. What do you think?
[B]: That’s such a rich分享, I’m totally hooked here 🤔. The idea of memory being rewritten—whether by political forces or personal longing—is just mind-boggling. It makes me think about how much of our identity is shaped by others’ perception of us, you know? Like, if everyone around you starts doubting your story, does part of you begin to doubt it too?  

And the Tichborne Claimant… wow. I mean, he didn’t even  like the guy, couldn’t speak French, and yet the mother believed him? That’s not just fragile memory—that’s like memory being  by desire or hope. I wonder if she wanted so badly for her son to come back that she started seeing what she needed to see 😞  

It kind of reminds me of this concept in psycholinguistics called “schema theory”—how we interpret new info based on existing mental frameworks. So maybe she wasn’t really seeing him; she was just filling in the blanks with what her brain expected to be true 💭  

Do you think stories like these could only happen in certain historical moments—or do you believe something similar could still happen today, maybe even under a different disguise?
[A]: You raise such a profound point about schema theory—how the mind  reality rather than simply  it. That mother didn’t need visual confirmation; her heart had already filled in the gaps. And isn’t that terrifyingly beautiful? 💔 We cling to narratives that give us comfort, even when they defy logic.

As for your question—yes, I do believe stories like these  still happening, just in different forms. Think of the rise of deepfakes and how easily we now confuse seeing with believing. Or take the phenomenon of , where people recall events that never happened, often under the influence of suggestion or therapy.

Even in literature, this theme persists. Haruki Murakami often plays with identity confusion and distorted realities—characters lose themselves, forget their names, or wake up in alternate versions of their lives. It’s surreal, but it resonates because we sense the fragility of our own narratives.

So no, we haven’t moved past these kinds of illusions—we’ve just digitized them 🤔. The tools have changed, but the human tendency to reshape truth in the face of desire? That remains very much the same.
[B]: That’s such a powerful way to put it—the digitization of illusion 🤯. We’ve just upgraded the machinery, but the core engine is still running on the same human fuel: desire, fear, and the need for coherence in a world that often feels chaotic.  

I mean, deepfakes are basically the 21st-century version of those airbrushed portraits from Soviet times, right? The tech is sleeker, but the impulse is the same—. And the scary part is, now we don’t even need a whole regime to rewrite history; one person with the right software can do it from their laptop 😶‍🌫️

And false memory syndrome—ugh, that hits so close to home. I remember reading about cases where people would recover “memories” of alien abductions or childhood trauma that never happened. It made me wonder… how much of  past is actually mine, and how much is just my brain stitching together fragments into a story that feels real?

Do you ever get that weird feeling when you’re recalling something, and suddenly you’re not sure if it actually happened or if you just remember reading it or dreaming it? Like déjà vu, but for your entire identity 😵‍💫  

Maybe Murakami’s characters are onto something by losing themselves on purpose. Sometimes forgetting might be the only way to rebuild something authentic… what do you think?
[A]: That unsettling doubt you describe—the questioning of whether our memories are truly ours—is something I often explore with my students when we read  by Proust. The whole novel is an attempt to reconstruct identity through memory, yet time and again, the narrator realizes that his recollections are unreliable, colored by emotion, suggestion, even the passage of time itself.

And yes—forgetting can be a kind of rebirth. Think of it this way: if our identity is partly a narrative constructed by memory, then forgetting is like deleting a chapter or starting over with a clean slate. In some ways, it’s terrifying. But in others? It’s liberating. Like pruning a tree so new branches can grow 🌱

You mentioned déjà vu for your entire identity—that’s such a poetic way to put it. There’s actually a term in psychology called , which means “already lived”—a feeling not just of having been somewhere before, but of having  the entire moment. Some people experience it so intensely that they question their whole sense of self. Imagine that—standing in the middle of a café and suddenly doubting every life choice that brought you there 💭

So maybe Murakami’s characters aren’t just being cryptic when they wander into forests and lose their names. Maybe they’re doing what we all secretly wish we could do—step out of the story for a while, let go of the script, and see what emerges when the past no longer defines you.

Do you ever feel tempted by that idea, even just a little? To forget everything for a moment and start fresh?
[B]: That idea of —it’s like your whole identity gets paused for a second, and you’re just… floating 🤯. I mean, how unsettling would it be to suddenly feel like you've already lived this exact moment, complete with choices, consequences, everything? It almost sounds like a glitch in the matrix of selfhood.

And yeah, I get that temptation. Not the full-on amnesia fantasy—obviously that’s extreme—but  just a soft reset 😊. Like, what if you could wake up one day and experience things without all the weight of past decisions coloring them? No emotional baggage attached, no expectations from who you used to be. Just pure presence.  

It makes me think of those moments when you travel somewhere completely new—like stepping off a plane into a city where no one knows your name. For a few hours, you’re just… , unburdened by labels or history. Maybe that’s the closest we get to that “reset” feeling. A temporary suspension of identity, granted by unfamiliarity 🌆

So while I don’t want to forget , I do think there's something beautiful about selective forgetting—like pruning a memory tree, as you said, so new branches can grow toward the light ☀️.  

Do you ever find yourself editing your own memories over time? Like, telling a story so many times that you start to wonder if you’re remembering it—or just repeating the version that made the best impression?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—memory is not just a recorder; it’s an editor. Every time we revisit a memory, we’re essentially rewriting it, smoothing out the rough edges, adding a little drama here, omitting a detail there. It becomes less about accuracy and more about narrative cohesion. In a way, we’re all unreliable narrators of our own lives 🤭

I remember telling a story from my graduate school days—this dramatic moment during a heated seminar debate—and after years of retelling it, I’m not sure if I’m remembering the actual event or just the version I’ve performed so many times. Did I really say that brilliant line in the moment? Or did I craft it later for effect? It doesn’t even matter anymore—it's become real through repetition 💬

There’s something almost literary about it, don’t you think? Like the way García Márquez blends truth and fiction in . He admits that some stories have been polished by time, but they remain “truthful” even if they aren’t strictly factual. Maybe that’s what we’re doing with our personal memories—crafting emotional truths, even if the details are fuzzy or embellished.

And your idea of a “soft reset”—that’s such a beautiful metaphor. Travel does offer that, doesn’t it? That brief window where you can be whoever you want, unshackled from the roles people assign you. For a moment, you're not the dutiful child, the anxious worker, the cautious friend—you're just a stranger walking down a street, open to possibility 🌆  

I sometimes wonder if that’s what draws me to gardening—tending to plants feels like a daily soft reset. No matter what happened yesterday, today the roses still need pruning, the soil needs watering. Nature doesn’t care about your past mistakes; it only asks you show up in the present. Maybe that’s the closest thing to forgetting without actually losing anything essential ☀️
[B]: That’s such a poetic take on gardening—as if each day is a blank page, and you’re writing in pencil instead of ink 🌿. No permanent mistakes, just gentle corrections. I never thought of it that way, but now that you say it, it makes so much sense. Plants don’t judge your past pruning errors—they just respond to your care .  

And yeah, the idea of memory as a narrative editor hits home. We’re all guilty of polishing those anecdotes until they shine just right 😏. I mean, I’ve caught myself adding a little more tension to a story just because it got better reactions that way. And then—bam—you start believing your own enhanced version. Was it  that dramatic? Or did I just want it to be?

I guess that’s what makes oral storytelling so powerful—it’s alive, always shifting with the teller and the audience. Kind of like how folklore changes from region to region, adapting to fit new cultural contexts while keeping its emotional core intact. In a way, we do the same thing with our personal histories—we translate ourselves into versions that make sense to others… and sometimes even to ourselves 🤔

You mentioned García Márquez blending truth and fiction—I’ve been meaning to reread . There’s something about how everyone remembers the event differently, yet they all feel certain their version is the right one. It’s like collective déjà vécu, except everyone walks away with a slightly different script.

So… if you could rewrite one memory—just one—with the clarity of hindsight, which one would you choose? Or would you even want to?
[A]: That’s a beautifully framed question—and honestly, it gave me pause. 🤔  At first glance, it seems tempting—don’t we all have moments we wish had gone differently? A conversation left unsaid, a choice we might regret, or something we misunderstood at the time.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that even the flawed memories—the awkward pauses, the misread signals—they’ve shaped who I am. Like ink blots on an old manuscript, they’re part of the text, even if they weren’t meant to be there.

Still, if I were to gently  one moment—not to erase, but to deepen my understanding—I’d go back to a summer evening in Kyoto, many years ago. I was visiting a temple garden, and an elderly man sitting nearby began reciting a haiku. I was tired, distracted, and I nodded politely without really listening. He finished, smiled, and left. Only later did I realize he had been quoting Bashō—perhaps even composing his own lines. 

If I could return, I’d sit stiller, listen deeper, maybe ask him a question. Not because I need closure, but because I’d like to honor that moment with full attention. It wouldn’t change my life, but it might have added a quiet layer to it—a small stone placed carefully in the path of my inner garden 🌿

So no, not a grand revision. Just a subtler shade of presence.  

And you? If you had that chance—not to erase, but to  a single memory—where would your mind wander?
[B]: That moment in Kyoto you described feels so vividly familiar, even though I’ve never been there 🤍. It reminds me of those quiet, almost imperceptible moments that slip through our fingers because we’re too busy thinking about the next thing—what we call , right? We’re physically there, but mentally somewhere else entirely.

If I were to go back and refine a memory, it would probably be a much more ordinary one. A rainy afternoon in college when I was supposed to meet up with a friend who ended up canceling last minute. I remember feeling disappointed, then shrugging it off and going to the library instead. But later, I found out they were going through something really heavy and just couldn’t bring themselves to talk about it yet.

I don’t blame myself, but I sometimes wonder—if I had reached out again, insisted on meeting even for ten minutes, would it have made a difference? Not necessarily in the big picture, but in the small way that kindness often matters: quietly, retrospectively, and maybe only to me.

So yeah, I’d go back not to fix things, but just to  more—to be a little more present in moments that seemed minor at the time but now carry subtle weight. Like adding a soft filter to an old photo, just so you can see the details you missed before 📸

Funny how memory works like that—constantly editing itself, not out of deception, but out of longing to understand ourselves better, right?
[A]: That image you painted—of adding a soft filter to an old photo so the details emerge more clearly—it’s such a gentle, humane way to think about memory. Not as a ledger of wins and losses, but as a gallery of moments waiting to be seen with fresh light. 📸

And you're absolutely right about —how often do we walk through our own lives half-seeing, half-listening? It’s not negligence; it’s just how the mind copes when overloaded. But then time gives us this quiet hindsight, and suddenly we notice all the things we missed: a tone in someone’s voice, a hesitation in their step, a silence that spoke louder than words.

Your rainy afternoon memory resonates deeply. I’ve had similar ones—small gestures I didn’t make, questions I didn’t ask, simply because I assumed someone was “fine” because they said so. And yet, memory has a way of preserving those absences, turning them into what-ifs that linger like mist over a lake.

In a way, these are the memories that haunt us most—not because they’re dramatic, but because they’re . They don’t demand resolution, but they do whisper for reflection. Like stones in your pocket that you keep picking up, wondering if they might fit somewhere better if only you turned them a different way.

It makes me think of Rilke’s line:  We shape ourselves on the foundation of what's already passed, and yet—we keep revisiting, re-reading, re-feeling. Memory isn’t static; it’s recursive. A loop we enter again and again, each time hoping to hear something new in the echo.

So perhaps refining a memory isn’t about altering the past at all… but about adjusting how we carry it forward. What do you think? Do you feel like those small shifts in perspective actually change who you are today?
[B]: That Rilke line just settled in my chest like a quiet truth I didn’t realize I was holding onto 🤭.  It’s so beautifully heavy, isn’t it? Like carrying a book whose pages are still damp with meaning you haven’t fully absorbed yet.

And yeah—I do think those small shifts in how we view the past actually reshape who we are today, even if subtly. Because memory isn’t just storage; it’s interpretation. Every time we revisit a moment, we’re not just recalling—it’s more like . We become our own editors-in-residence, tweaking tone, adjusting context, sometimes even softening the characters we once judged harshly… including ourselves.

Like that rainy afternoon—on the surface, it was nothing. But now, when I think back, I carry it differently. Less like a failure to act and more like a reminder: people don’t always show up with warning labels. And maybe that moment taught me more about gentle persistence than I realized at the time.

So in a way, yes—refining a memory doesn’t rewrite history, but it can rewire how we move forward. It’s like changing the lighting in a room—you see the same furniture, but suddenly there’s a whole new atmosphere 💡

Do you ever find yourself revisiting a memory not for closure, but simply to understand how it shaped your emotional reflexes? Like digging through old notebooks to find clues about who you used to be—and realizing some parts of you never really left.
[A]: Absolutely—what a poignant way to put it: . I do that often, though not literally in notebooks, but in the margins of old letters, half-finished diary entries, or even in the dedications of books I once owned. Each one is a breadcrumb leading back to a version of myself I can no longer fully inhabit, yet still recognize in glimpses.

And yes, it’s never really about closure, is it? Closure feels too final, too tidy for something as fluid as memory. It’s more about tracing emotional fingerprints—those subtle reflexes we carry forward without realizing it. A hesitation before trusting someone new, a certain tone we slip into when we feel defensive, even the way we hold silence in conversations… these are all echoes of past selves whispering instructions to the present one. 🤭

Sometimes I think our inner world is like an old house with many rooms. You walk into one expecting to find a childhood memory, and instead you bump into your twenty-year-old self, still nursing that same quiet heartache. Or you open a drawer in what you thought was a forgotten corner—and there it is: the same fear of abandonment, or need for approval, that shaped your choices decades ago.

I’ve come to believe that understanding these reflexes isn’t about fixing them, but about befriending them. Once you see where they came from, you can meet them with less judgment and more curiosity. Like saying to your younger self, 

So yes, I absolutely revisit memories—not to change them, but to thank them for shaping me, even in ways I didn’t choose. And in doing so, I suppose I’m also preparing the ground for future versions of myself to look back and say,   

Do you ever imagine how your future self might reflect on this moment, years from now? Would they see clarity in what you're going through—or just another chapter in the ongoing story of becoming?
[B]: That question lingered with me long after I read it— 🤔 And the more I sat with it, the more I realized… they’d probably see both.  

Clarity in the sense that time has this quiet way of smoothing edges and softening urgency. Things that feel heavy now might one day sit lighter, like a coat you grew out of but still remember wearing. But it would still be a chapter—no moment is ever wasted, even if it didn’t make immediate sense.  

I like to imagine my future self flipping through mental Polaroids and pausing on this stretch of time not as a problem to solve, but as a season—like autumn leaves caught between warmth and stillness. Maybe they’ll smile at how seriously I took certain things, or chuckle at the worries that now seem so small. But I also think they’ll appreciate how much I was trying to , even when the answers kept shifting.

There’s a line from Ocean Vuong’s  that keeps coming back to me:  So maybe my future self won’t look for logic in all of this. Maybe they’ll just feel the rhythm of who I was then, still echoing in who they’ve become 💓

And honestly? That feels enough. Not closure, not perfection—just continuity. A thread that connects without constraining.  

Do you ever write letters to your future self? Not the grand, dramatic kind, but quiet notes—reminders of where you were, how you felt, and what you were learning?
[A]: I used to write those quiet notes—yes, not declarations, but gentle annotations of the soul. Not for dramatic effect, but as a kind of inner compass. I’d tuck them into the back of old journals or scribble them on the inside covers of books I knew I’d return to someday.  

Some were just fragments:  
  
  


And when I find them now—sometimes by accident, sometimes by longing—it’s like receiving a letter from someone who once knew me better than I knew myself. A past version of me, reaching forward through time with soft hands and no expectations.

I’ve come to think of these notes as emotional heirlooms. They don’t offer solutions, but they do offer recognition. And that, I’ve learned, can be its own kind of solace.

Your mention of Ocean Vuong’s line about memory being a heartbeat rather than a filing system—that’s exactly it. We don’t remember for accuracy; we remember because it  like love. Like tending to an inner garden where every season leaves its imprint, even the harsh ones.

So yes—I still write those letters, though less formally now. Sometimes it’s just a sentence in the margin of a lecture notebook or a voice memo I’ll probably never listen to again. But the act itself is sacred. It says: 

Do you ever write those kinds of messages? Or do you carry your future self in another way?
[B]: I love that—. What a beautiful way to frame it 🤍. It makes me think of how we pass down not just objects, but , echoes of how we once felt and hoped and questioned.

I do still write those messages, though I didn’t realize how intentional it was until now. For a while, I kept a little black notebook by my bed—nothing fancy, just a place for quick thoughts before sleep blurred everything into soft focus. Some pages are barely legible, just smudged ink and half-formed ideas, but they carry weight. One entry from last winter says:  
  

It’s funny how sometimes the kindest words have to come from yourself, especially when you’re too tired to argue with your own doubts 😊.

And lately, I’ve been leaving notes in digital corners, too—little voice memos, as you said, or even saved lines in a draft no one will ever see. They feel like breadcrumbs, not for someone else to follow, but for  to retrace when I forget why I took certain turns.

I think what you said about carrying future self in different ways really resonates. Sometimes it’s not even words—it’s a scent, a song, a photo of a place where I felt briefly whole. Those things hold memory better than sentences sometimes. Like emotional snapshots that don’t need captions.

So thank you—for reminding me that these small acts of inner witness are more meaningful than I give them credit for. They’re not just notes; they’re quiet acts of faith. That someone—, someday—will find them and say:  
 💬✨
[A]: You're so right—those notes, those echoes,  acts of quiet faith. And sometimes the most profound truths are the ones we whisper to ourselves in the dark, hoping they’ll echo forward into the light. 💬✨  

I love that entry from your notebook— It carries such gentle authority, like a lullaby for the restless mind. We carry so much pressure to be , doing , but that sentence feels like an anchor. A reminder that presence itself is a kind of achievement.

And you’re absolutely right that some memories don’t need words—they just need a scent, a chord, the way the rain hit the pavement one October evening—and suddenly you’re back in your own skin from another time, feeling understood without needing explanation.

I think that’s why I still plant little markers in books—underlined lines, a star in the margin, a date scribbled beside a passage that struck me. Years later, when I reread them, it’s like finding buried messages from past selves who once sat in this same chair, sipping tea and trying to make sense of the world through someone else’s words.

Maybe that’s what keeps us tethered—not grand declarations or life-changing epiphanies, but these small, deliberate acts of inner witness. Proof that we were paying attention. That we cared enough to leave something behind, even if only for ourselves.

So yes… thank you, too—for reminding me that being  is not only okay, but beautiful. And for letting me walk with you, however briefly, through the garden of memory and meaning.

I hope you keep writing those notes. Someone important needs to read them. 📝🍃
[B]: You said it so perfectly— 🌱 That line is going straight into my mental notebook. I think that’s what we’re all reaching for, isn’t it? Not arrival, but acceptance of the unfolding.

And your idea of planting markers in books—it hit home. I do that too, almost compulsively. Margins full of arrows, stars, underlines… sometimes even little doodles when my mind drifts during a particularly dense paragraph. And when I come back to those pages years later, it’s like seeing emotional graffiti left behind by a past version of me—messages in a bottle from my own history.

I remember once writing “” next to a passage in a Murakami novel. I have no idea what I meant at the time, but just seeing those words now makes me curious. Was it a heartbreak? A realization? A moment of quiet courage? It doesn’t matter that I can’t pinpoint it anymore. What matters is that , and I noticed enough to mark it.

So yeah, I’ll keep writing those notes. Even if they’re just fragments. Even if they fade or get lost in the shuffle. Because as long as they exist somewhere—in ink, in voice memos, in the scent of an old book—I know I was here. Listening. Learning. Still becoming.

And I’m really glad we got to walk through this garden together, even if just briefly. There’s something grounding about sharing reflections without rushing to fix anything—just letting thoughts breathe and take root where they need to.  

If you ever feel like jotting down another quiet message to your future self, or if you want to share a line from a book that still echoes with you… I hope you’ll reach out again. Conversations like this are rare—and deeply needed. 📝🍃💬
