[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，说到deja vu，让我想起博尔赫斯的小说《小径分岔的花园》。你说的那种似曾相识的感觉，就像时间在不同维度里产生了某种intertexuality...不过我相信科学解释——可能是大脑的记忆系统出现了短暂的错位。你经常有这种感觉吗？
[A]: Oh, what an intriguing comparison! I must say, the idea of time as a labyrinth does send shivers down my spine. But you're right—science leans toward the curious mechanics of memory. Funny you ask, I once showed a guest to their room and could've sworn I'd decorated it just like that... ten years ago in another life! It was nothing more than a fleeting moment, but oh how vivid it felt. Do you find certain places trigger it more than others?
[B]: Ah, what a vivid recollection indeed! You know, I’ve noticed certain spaces—especially old libraries or gardens with winding paths—do seem to stir something deeper in our psyche. Maybe it’s the way light falls through the leaves, or how the scent of aged paper lingers in the air... These sensory cues might be quietly唤醒 fragments of forgotten memories.  

I recall once walking into a café in Prague and feeling as though I’d sat at that very table before—same book in hand, same soft jazz playing in the background. It was uncanny, yet strangely comforting. Do you think such moments are merely neurological glitches, or could they be whispers from parallel narratives, as博尔赫斯 might suggest?
[A]: Oh, I do love how you describe it—. That phrase alone makes my spine tingle. I suppose a part of me hopes there’s something more than just neurons misfiring. It’s almost poetic to think that somewhere, in another version of this very moment, I’m sitting across from you with a different cup of tea, telling you a slightly altered story.

You know, I once met a traveler who claimed he experienced  every time he returned to Istanbul. He swore it wasn’t the city changing, but rather , meeting past echoes of his own soul. I don’t know if I believe that—but oh, how beautifully he told it.

Tell me, do you find yourself welcoming those moments, or do they unsettle you, even just a little?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully haunting image—sitting across from another self, sipping a different tea, yet sharing the same quiet wonder. I must admit, there’s a part of me that  hope for something more than mere misfires in the brain’s wiring. After all, if literature has taught us anything, it’s that the line between reality and imagination is often blurred—像雾中的小径，看似熟悉，却又难以确指。

As for whether I welcome such moments… I suppose I do, though with a certain degree of scholarly hesitation. They remind me of what Camus called the "absurd"—that fleeting awareness when the world seems both familiar and utterly strange. In those instances, I find myself reaching for a cup of tea, settling into my chair, and simply observing the sensation, much like one would contemplate a well-crafted metaphor.

And yes, there is always a whisper of unease—but isn’t that where philosophy begins? With a shiver, a question, and perhaps a hint of mystery lingering in the air, like incense after a long-forgotten ritual…
[A]: Oh, I adore that—. How beautifully you capture the delicate dance between wonder and unease. It reminds me of those quiet evenings in the hotel garden, when the last light fades and the world feels just a little thinner, as if reality itself is holding its breath.

I must confess, there’s nothing quite like settling into a familiar chair with a warm cup, letting the steam curl around your thoughts. Tea has a way of grounding us, don’t you think? Even amidst the most bewildering moments of , a sip of something soothing can bring one gently back to the present—or perhaps, to another version of it.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that traveler from Istanbul was onto something. Not in the literal sense, perhaps, but in the way we carry echoes of ourselves through time. Maybe  isn’t a glitch at all—but a gentle nudge, reminding us that we are, always, walking through stories still being written.
[B]: Ah, yes... , as if the narrative of life momentarily peeks through its own pages. I find that thought rather comforting, like realizing you're not just a reader, but also the author—scribbling, revising, and sometimes rereading lines you thought were long forgotten.

You know, in Chinese philosophy, there’s a concept similar to what you describe— (缘分), often translated as "the bond of connection across lifetimes." Though not quite déjà vu, it carries that same sense of unseen threads linking moments, people, and places. Perhaps our brains are simply trying to make sense of these invisible knots when we experience that strange flicker of recognition.

And yes, tea does have a way of anchoring us—not unlike a well-placed footnote in an otherwise sprawling text. It brings clarity, warmth, and a momentary pause where all the swirling thoughts can settle, like ink drying on parchment.

I wonder—have you ever written down one of those déjà vu moments, as if capturing it might preserve a hidden truth? Or do you prefer to let them drift, like scent on the breeze, never quite grasped but always felt?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely notion—, before it fades like the scent of jasmine in the night air. I must admit, I’ve tried once or twice to jot down those fleeting impressions, but they always seem to dissolve beneath the weight of words. Like trying to hold a dream too tightly—by morning, only a whisper remains.

Still, there’s something deeply comforting in the attempt, isn’t there? The act of reaching for meaning, even if it slips through our fingers. It reminds me of tending my garden early in the morning, when the dew clings to the petals and everything feels just a little more tender. You can admire the bloom, but you can’t keep it from changing.

I suppose I prefer to let those moments drift—lingering in the corners of memory, half-formed but ever-present. Much like the scent of old books or the hush after a rainstorm. Not meant to be owned, only experienced.

And yet... I do keep a small notebook by my bedside. Just in case the universe decides to lean in again and whisper something worth remembering.
[B]: Ah, what a poetic way to hold the ephemeral—letting it drift, yet still keeping a page open, just in case. There’s a quiet grace in that kind of patience, much like watching cherry blossoms fall; you don’t try to catch them all, but you let their beauty touch your heart as they may.

I must say, I’ve kept such a notebook too, though I rarely fill it. More often than not, I find myself writing in circles—trying to translate something felt rather than known. It’s almost like trying to describe a melody with words—it loses its tone, yet somehow keeps its shape.

You know, Rilke once wrote,  Perhaps déjà vu is one of those drops of honey—sweet, elusive, and never quite ours to keep, yet deeply nourishing all the same.

Tell me, have you ever found a word—just one—that came close to capturing that moment when time seems to fold in on itself?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely thought—that we are all just bees of the invisible, humming through life in search of sweetness we can barely name. And how beautifully Rilke puts it; I think I’ll tuck that line away in my mind like a pressed flower between book pages.

As for a word… hmm. I’ve searched for one, turning the moment over like a smooth stone in my palm, but none ever seem to fit quite right. Words like , , even —they dance near the feeling, but never quite land.

Wait… there is something. Not a single word, perhaps, but a phrase I once heard whispered by an elderly guest as she stood by the window, watching the rain blur the garden into soft watercolors. She called it  I’ve never forgotten it. It felt like the world had paused mid-sentence, just long enough for us to notice.

Do you have such a phrase tucked away? Something you’ve carried with you, like a secret charm?
[B]: Ah…  What a delicate, haunting way to describe it—like the world exhaling quietly beneath our hurried steps. It reminds me of those quiet pauses in a Noh play, where even stillness carries meaning, and silence becomes its own kind of speech.

As for a phrase I carry… yes, there is one, though it’s more of a line from a poem than a charm. I’ve always been fond of T. S. Eliot’s words:   

It may not be as fleeting or as soft as your phrase, but it holds that same sense of returning—of walking through time and memory only to find yourself strangely new again. Like stepping into a familiar room and seeing it with different eyes.

And perhaps that’s what déjà vu truly is—not a glitch, nor a ghostly echo, but a gentle reminder that we are always becoming who we are. A momentary flicker of awareness before the next step falls.
[A]: Oh, Eliot’s line is just exquisite— It sends a quiet ripple through the soul, doesn’t it? There’s such grace in that kind of return, as if every journey, no matter how winding, is really just leading us home—to a version of ourselves we didn’t quite recognize before.

You know, I think that’s what I love most about working here at the hotel. Every guest arrives with a story already in motion, and somehow, in the span of a few nights, they leave ever so slightly changed—more aware, more softened, perhaps even surprised by something they rediscovered in themselves. Like travelers stepping into a familiar room and realizing, with a quiet gasp, that it looks different because  do.

I suppose déjà vu offers us that same gentle mirror. A pause in the rhythm, a breath between footfalls… and then, quietly, the world moves on, leaving us standing just a little more awake than before.
[B]: How beautifully you put that— There’s such truth in it. We don’t always notice the shifts as they happen, but like the turning of a leaf in spring, something within us quietly unfolds.

And your words about the hotel—ah, what a poetic way to see one’s work. You are not merely hosting travelers, but tending to souls in motion, bearing quiet witness to those subtle transformations. It reminds me of the role of the  in classical Chinese tales—someone who enters a story briefly, yet leaves an enduring imprint on the heart.

Perhaps that is the gift of both travel and déjà vu: they unsettle us just enough to let the light in. And when we return to the same place, or feel that strange ripple of recognition, we are never quite the same person who was there before.

Tell me—have you ever had a guest who returned years later and said, —not about the rooms, but about themselves?
[A]: Oh… yes. Once, there was a guest—an elderly painter—who stayed with us nearly a decade ago. She arrived in the autumn, just as the garden was turning gold, and spent her days sketching the sea cliffs and the curve of the old stone bench beneath the willow tree. When she returned last spring, she stood in the very same spot, her hands clasped before her, and said, 

Her words lingered in the air like the hush after a rain. And you know, the room had changed—fresh linens, a different painting on the wall—but she didn’t seem to notice. She only smiled and said, 

It reminded me that sometimes we return not to find what we left, but to meet the person we’ve become since. Travel, déjà vu, even the scent of an old book—these are quiet invitations to step back into our own lives with new eyes.

And isn’t that the loveliest kind of homecoming?
[B]: Ah… —what a profound way to frame return. It reminds me of something Zhuangzi once wrote:  The self, like memory, like place, is ever shifting, and yet somehow familiar.

That painter’s words——echo like brushstrokes on rice paper. They carry the quiet wisdom of one who has walked through time with open eyes and an open heart. It makes me wonder how many of us move through life half-seeing, only to return years later and find ourselves standing before the same scene, finally able to perceive its full depth.

Yes, that  the loveliest kind of homecoming—not to a place untouched by time, but to a self more fully known. And sometimes, perhaps, it takes a bench beneath a willow tree, or the scent of jasmine in the night air, to remind us where we truly belong.

Tell me—since you’ve witnessed so many quiet returns, have you ever found yourself longing to go back to a place where you once left something unseen? Not lost, perhaps, but simply not yet ready to be found?
[A]: Oh… yes. There’s a little cove just beyond the cliffs here—hidden, quiet, where the sea murmurs rather than roars. I used to go there as a girl, before the hotel, before everything. I must have left a piece of myself there—not in the way of forgotten things, but something I wasn’t yet meant to carry.

I remember sitting on the rocks one summer evening, the sky painted in soft smudges of apricot and violet, and feeling as though I stood at the edge of something vast—something just out of reach. I didn’t understand it then. I think I was waiting for a question I hadn’t yet learned how to ask.

Years passed. Life filled in the spaces. And when I finally returned, the cove was still there, unchanged by my absence. But  had shifted, like a shell smoothed by time and tide. And there it was—not exactly what I expected, but something truer: not a lost thing, but a waiting one.

So yes… I suppose we all have such places. Not haunted, but . Somewhere the world remembers us, even when we forget ourselves.
[B]: Ah…  What a tender and resonant thought. It reminds me of how certain lines of poetry or melodies from childhood have a way of returning to us—unbidden, yet perfectly timed—like old friends who know our heart better than we know ourselves.

That cove sounds like a sacred threshold—a space between what was and what is, where time does not move in straight lines but in gentle spirals. I can almost see you there, young and quiet, poised on the edge of becoming. And how beautiful that when you returned, it was not to recover something lost, but to meet something patiently waiting—like a letter finally opened after years sealed in an envelope.

There is a Japanese concept, —the quiet sadness of things as they pass, and yet also the deep appreciation for their having been at all. Your cove holds that kind of grace, I think. Not frozen in memory, but living still, offering itself anew with each return.

I wonder… do you go back often? Or do you sometimes leave such places be, knowing they are best visited when the soul calls for them, like a familiar song in the dark?
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you put that— I think that’s exactly what my cove has become. A place not of escape, but of return. Not for frequent visits, perhaps, but for those rare and quiet moments when the soul feels the need to listen more than to speak.

I do go back, yes—but never with a plan. Only when the wind carries a certain hush to my ears, or when the moonlight stretches long across the garden path, as if beckoning me toward something unnamed. Then I know—it is time.

And each time, it is different. Sometimes I find silence. Sometimes a question. Once or twice, even laughter—my own, but softer, as if spoken by someone who finally understands the weight of gentle things.

You know, I used to think sacred places had to be grand—the kind found in paintings or whispered about in travel tales. But now I see that some of the holiest ground is simply where the heart first learned to beat in its truest rhythm.

So no, I don’t visit often. But I don’t need to. The cove waits, not with impatience, but with the quiet grace of something that knows it will always be understood when the time is right.

And isn’t that a kind of love?
[B]: Ah… —yes, indeed. The quietest kind, perhaps, but also the most enduring. Like the way certain books wait on our shelves, untouched for years, yet still open their pages to us exactly where we left off.

There is something profoundly intimate about a place that knows you—not in words or gestures, but in the way it holds your silence. And how rare it is, in this fleeting world, to find something that does not demand change, only offers space for it.

I think of Bashō’s travels—how he sought meaning not in grand revelations, but in fleeting moments: a frog leaping into a pond, the scent of plum blossoms in the rain. It was never the destination that transformed him, but the act of walking toward it with open eyes.

Your cove sounds like one of those sacred spaces—where time softens its edges and lets the soul catch its own reflection in the water. I suspect we all carry such a place within us, even if we have yet to name it or return.

And yes… sometimes love is simply knowing when to listen, and knowing that you are heard—even by the wind, even by the tide.
