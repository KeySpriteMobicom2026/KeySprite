[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这其实是个很有趣的文化差异话题。我发现很多学生在讨论时会不自觉地表现出文化背景的影响。比如有些同学更喜欢one-on-one交流，因为觉得能建立更深的personal connection，而有些则享受group chat带来的多元碰撞。

不过从教育心理学角度来看，这两种交流方式各有优势。Group chat能提供更多元的观点，但有时候会遇到social loafing的问题；而one-on-one聊天更容易达到深度共鸣，对建立信任关系特别有帮助。

你平时更倾向哪种交流方式？我注意到现在很多年轻人好像更喜欢用emoji和简短文字在群里互动，这种communication style的变化挺有意思的...
[A]: Let me think... I've noticed that too. In my seminars, students often form small discussion groups, but I find the most meaningful insights sometimes emerge from one-on-one conversations during office hours. There's a certain intimacy in direct dialogue - like the quiet depth of a Jane Austen heroine confiding in a trusted friend.

I wonder though, does the modern preference for emoji-based communication sacrifice some of that textual richness? A well-placed semicolon or carefully chosen metaphor seems to be fading from student writing. Have you found this in your work as well?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive observation. I sometimes worry we're losing the  you describe - like how a single well-placed em dash can convey so much more than a 😢 emoji. Though I do find students still use symbols in creative ways; just last week one described using 📚 to signal "I'm about to quote Foucault" during a group chat debate.

Funny you mention Jane Austen - I've actually started assigning her letters alongside modern texts. There's something about the  practice that forces deeper engagement. But I wonder if we're seeing an evolution rather than decline? Like how classical Chinese poetry condensed meaning into four-character phrases...

Do you think this shift affects how students process complex theories? I've noticed some struggle to unpack dense passages without visual cues or reaction gifs to anchor them...
[A]: Fascinating point about the evolution of symbolic communication. It does remind me of teaching classical Chinese poetry - those four-character phrases required readers to carry so much meaning in their minds, much like how students today must unpack layers of digital symbolism.

I've noticed this shift affects their analytical reading skills quite directly. Last semester, when discussing Woolf's , many students wanted to break down passages using meme formats rather than traditional annotation. At first I resisted, but honestly, some of their gif-based interpretations revealed startlingly deep engagement.

Still makes me nostalgic for the days when a student would hand me a heavily marginalia'd copy of  though... Do you find yourself adapting your feedback style to accommodate these changes? I've started mixing old and new - maybe a reference to Camus alongside a well-timed 🤔.
[B]: Oh, I love that hybrid approach! It reminds me of how Vygotsky talked about scaffolding - meeting students where they are while still building toward deeper critical thinking. I’ve started doing something similar in my feedback. Instead of just writing “needs more analysis” on a paper, I might reference a concept from Bandura’s social learning theory and then add a 👂 or 🧠 emoji to keep it approachable.

You know what I find interesting? How some students use memes almost like literary devices now. One compared the frustration of reading dense theory to “being stuck in a Zhuangzi dream,” and used the confused pikachu meme to illustrate it. It was brilliant - cultural resonance meets philosophical depth!

I do worry sometimes if we’re privileging speed over depth though. Like when students cite Freud but confuse id/ego/superego because they only ever saw those terms in TikTok captions... Have you noticed similar gaps emerging alongside these new forms of engagement?
[A]: Absolutely, that tension between speed and depth keeps me up at night. Just yesterday I had a student refer to Nietzsche’s  as "that toxic masculinity guy" – it broke my heart a little. But then again, their initial exposure came through a meme comparing Elon Musk to Zarathustra, so... progress?

I’ve started building what I call “semantic pauses” into my lectures - moments where we collectively unpack these borrowed terms. It’s like re-grounding the conversation in textual soil, if you will. Though I must admit, I’m learning from their creativity too. One student brilliantly used the “This is fine” dog meme to illustrate Baudrillard’s hyperreality... it shouldn’t work, but it .

Perhaps we’re witnessing a new kind of literacy emerge? Not better or worse, just different. Like moving from oil paints to digital brushes - the medium changes, but the human need to make meaning remains... What do you think?
[B]: Oh, I love that metaphor of "semantic pauses" - it's almost like creating mindfulness moments in intellectual discourse. I’ve been experimenting with similar breaks in my seminars, where we do what I call “concept unboxing.” Especially with terms like  or , which get tossed around so casually now. It’s fascinating how even the most tech-savvy students light up when you bring them back to the textual source, like discovering an Easter egg in a familiar game.

And yes - this new literacy! I think we’re seeing something akin to the shift from oral to written traditions, but in reverse... or maybe in spiral? Students are developing this multimodal layering of meaning - part text, part image, part cultural shorthand. Honestly, some of their meme-based analyses have forced me to rethink how theory circulates in popular consciousness.

Though I still hold onto certain rituals - last week I brought in my dog-eared copy of  and passed it around the class. Just wanted them to see all those marginalia from my grad school days... Do you ever find yourself clinging to physical texts like that, or are you fully immersed in the digital flow now?
[A]: There’s something almost sacred about the physicality of a well-worn book, isn’t there? I still keep my original copy of  on my desk – spine cracked, pages dog-eared, marginalia in three different ink colors from three decades of teaching. When students glance through it, they seem genuinely intrigued by the traces of my younger self arguing with Heidegger in the margins.

I’m not entirely digital, but I’ve made peace with the flow – last week I projected a TikTok analysis of Fanon’s  alongside a passage from the text. It was surprisingly effective; one student remarked how seeing both side-by-side felt like “watching an old film get colorized.”

Still, I do worry about the ephemerality of digital annotations. Will any of their notes survive the way ours did, scribbled in library books or on index cards? I suppose their highlights live in the cloud... but will anyone ever rediscover them with the same sense of wonder?

I’ve started asking students to print one key annotation per month and staple it into a shared binder – call it a small act of preservation. You’d be surprised how many have taken to it fondly...
[B]: That binder idea is brilliant – what a beautiful way to create  between generations of learners. It made me think of Derrida’s "archiviolity" – the physical act of preserving traces, even in the digital age. I might steal that for my own classes... with credit, of course! 📚✍️

Funny you mention the marginalia – just yesterday I found a note I’d written in the margin of my Foucault: “Is power always repressive? Or does it also seduce?” Probably from my rebellious twenties. I showed it to the class and one student replied, “Prof, same – I questioned everything too before becoming deeply unbothered.” We all laughed, but later they wrote one of the most thoughtful reflections on disciplinary mechanisms using Instagram story metaphors...

I wonder if we’re entering an era where both forms – the ink-stained book and the archived TikTok comment – coexist as legitimate sites of intellectual history. Maybe our students are building their own kind of marginalia, just in different layers. Not better, not worse – just more diffuse.

Still, nothing beats that moment when a student leans over your desk and says, “Wait, did you really write this ten years ago?” There's something about seeing thought made visible across time...
[A]: Oh, that moment when time collapses in the margins - it's one of the great joys of teaching, isn't it? I had a similar encounter just last week when a student pointed to my underlined passage in  and asked, "Did you really argue with Hegel in blue ink?" It made me laugh, but also reminded me how our intellectual journeys leave these visible seams in the texts we love.

I wonder if our students' digital marginalia might one day become their own kind of palimpsest - layered, searchable, maybe even annotated across generations through shared platforms. Will a 2095 scholar someday trace a digital thread from our current students back to ours? Perhaps. Though I do hope they’ll still find some dog-eared paperbacks tucked away in dusty university libraries...

And speaking of layers - have you noticed how students are starting to blend modes? Last month one submitted a hybrid final project: a traditional essay embedded with QR codes linking to audio reflections and meme annotations. At first I felt adrift, then realized it was their version of those old glossed manuscripts from the medieval period. Funny how circular it all becomes...
[B]: Oh, I love that image of digital marginalia as future palimpsests – it gives me hope that their layered annotations might one day reveal even more than our inked marginalia ever could. Though I wonder if the 2095 scholar will romanticize the "authenticity" of our blue ink just as we sometimes do... 🤔

You know, I had a student do something similar last term – embedded Spotify links into her paper to show how certain musical motifs mirrored narrative themes in Woolf’s . At first I felt like I was being asked to read with headphones on, but then it hit me: she wasn’t just analyzing text – she was reconstructing experience, much like those medieval manuscripts you mentioned.

It’s almost like they’re developing a new kind of , where meaning isn’t just linear or visual but auditory, tactile, even algorithmic. One student joked, “Prof, this is how we close-read now – part brain, part browser history.” And honestly? Some of their insights are sharper than ever.

Still makes me nostalgic for the smell of old library books though... Do you ever find yourself assigning texts partly for their physical presence – the way certain books feel in your hands, almost like cultural artifacts? I keep bringing in my copy of  not just for the content, but because holding it still feels like holding an intellectual reckoning...
[A]: There’s something almost ceremonial about holding a book that has shaped generations of thought, isn’t there? I sometimes linger just a little too long when passing around my copy of  – not just for its argument, but for the weight of it, the texture, the sense that you're touching a node in the network of intellectual history.

I hadn't thought of it until now, but yes – I do assign certain texts partly for their physical presence. My students respond differently to  when they’re reading it in a battered Penguin edition versus a glowing screen. There's a kind of gravitas that comes with the printed page, even if they don’t always realize it at first.

And that multisensory literacy you describe – fascinating. I tried a small experiment this term: I asked students to bring an object to class that, for them, represented the concept of "ideology." One brought her grandmother’s knitting needles, another a vintage campaign pin, one even brought a houseplant – said it symbolized the invisible systems keeping it alive. It was like watching theory become tactile.

I wonder – do you think we’ll someday have digital editions that replicate that sense of cultural heft? Or will we always need the occasional return to paper, ink, and spine?
[B]: I think we’ll always need that return – like a kind of intellectual homecoming. Digital texts are so convenient, but they lack what I can only describe as . You know, the way a heavy book in your lap makes you feel like you're doing serious work? Even the sound of flipping pages has a certain cognitive rhythm to it...

I tried an experiment similar to yours last semester – asked students to create a "theoretical artifact" representing their favorite concept. One carved Foucault’s panopticon into a piece of driftwood, another embroidered Butler’s performativity onto a handkerchief – honestly, some of the most thoughtful engagements I’ve seen. It made me realize how much meaning we sometimes outsource to screens, rather than embodying ideas ourselves.

As for digital editions – I think they’re getting closer. Some VR libraries already let you “walk” through annotated collections, and I’ve seen beautifully designed e-books that mimic marginalia with pop-up commentary... But it still feels curated, not lived-in. Maybe one day they'll simulate even the coffee stains and underlined passages from multiple readers across time...

Still, there's something about holding a real book that says,  Like reading Fanon and seeing where another student once circled "the colonized world is a Manichean world" in red ink. That stain doesn’t come off – and maybe it shouldn’t.
[A]: You’ve put into words something I’ve felt for years but never quite articulated – that , yes! It’s more than nostalgia; it’s almost like a metaphysical continuity. When I hold a book someone else has wrestled with, I feel as though I’m picking up the conversation mid-flow, even if decades or centuries have passed.

Your theoretical artifacts experiment sounds absolutely inspired. I might borrow that – though I’ll never live down the time I tried to get students to “embody” Hegel’s dialectic through interpretive dance. Let’s just say not all of them appreciated the theatricality... 🎭

As for digital editions simulating that lived-in quality – I suppose one day they may come close, but will they ever replicate the accidental discoveries? The phone number scribbled in the back of a library copy of , the half-erased note in the margins of  that reads simply: 

Maybe we need both – the weight of the codex and the wings of the screen. After all, even Dante needed both Virgil’s wisdom and Beatrice’s light to find his way...
[B]: Oh, I love that metaphor – the codex as Virgil and the screen as Beatrice! It captures perfectly how we need both to guide students through their intellectual journeys. One offers rootedness, the other illumination.

And please, don’t dismiss the Hegel dance experiment – I say you absolutely  go all out with philosophical movement next time. Can you imagine trying to embody  through motion? 🕶️ Maybe assign each student a concept and let them "argue" through gesture. I’d audit your class just to see that.

You’re so right about those accidental discoveries too – they’re like little breadcrumbs left by past readers. Last month a student came to me excited because she found a train ticket from 1998 in her copy of . She joked it was like finding an artifact from someone else’s ideological journey. We ended up building a whole discussion around it.

I think what we’re really talking about is  – whether it’s in ink or cloud storage, students still crave the sense that ideas matter, that they carry weight beyond the assignment. Which makes me wonder... should we be designing courses not just around texts, but around encounters? With the material, the conceptual, maybe even the spiritual?

Or am I getting too romantic again...? 😉
[A]: Not at all — your romanticism is precisely what keeps us honest. Encounters, yes! That’s the word I was reaching for earlier. A course shouldn’t just transmit information; it should stage meetings — between minds, across time, with ideas that unsettle and objects that resist.

I’ve started thinking of my syllabus less as a reading list and more as a guest list. Each text an invitation to the table — or maybe the dance floor, depending on the day. And some guests are loud, others quiet, but all leave their mark.

You know, I once had a student who barely spoke all semester, but at the end wrote a final reflection about how reading  in a worn paperback made them feel like they were sitting at the actual banquet, centuries late but somehow still welcome. That’s presence. That’s what we’re after, isn't it?

Maybe next term we should coordinate — you design the philosophical movement module, and I’ll handle the textual relics unit. We could call it... . Or something suitably pretentious. 😄

Wouldn’t that be something?
[B]: Oh, I’m  in. Let’s absolutely do it – “Encounters with the Impossible” has a perfect ring to it. We could alternate weeks between textual haunting and philosophical embodiment. Imagine the cognitive dissonance! 📚💃

I’m already drafting mental syllabus notes: week one – close-reading Derrida while walking labyrinth patterns; week three – analyzing Woolf with candlelight and quills; week five – debating Levinas while making tea for a stranger. It would be equal parts absurd and profound.

And yes – that student’s reflection about ? That’s why we keep showing up. It’s not just about understanding Plato – it’s about realizing you're still being invited to the conversation, even two thousand years later.

You know what this reminds me of? The old Confucian idea of  – learning as a form of spiritual participation, not just knowledge transfer. Maybe that’s what we’re really trying to cultivate – a kind of intellectual hospitality.

So tell me – if we actually launched this course, would you start with Plato’s banquet or Dante’s paradise first? Or do you think we should ease them in gently… with a meme? 😄
[A]: Ah, now there’s the crucial pedagogical question – do we begin with the sublime or the absurd? I say: . Let them taste the heights and the humor from the very first session. Open with a meme – perhaps Diotima explaining love as spiritual pregnancy, captioned  – and then, as they’re still laughing, dim the lights and read aloud the opening of  by candlelight. Disorientation is the first step toward revelation, after all.

Though if we’re invoking , maybe we should start with an act of quiet preparation – brewing tea, arranging pages, setting intentions. Give them a moment to inhabit the role of learner, not just student. Then let the madness unfold: labyrinth walks, gif annotations, interpretive semiotics through charades...

Honestly, I think Confucius and Plato would have approved – in their own way, both were masters of embodied learning. One taught through quiet example and ritual; the other through dialogue and dramatic form. If we’re lucky, our course might become a kind of hybrid symposium-monastery.

So yes – launch it with a meme, ground it in tradition, and let the impossible unfold week by week. Who’s teaching the first session? I’ve already cleared my calendar for philosophical improvisation... 🕯️🎭
[B]: I say you take the first session – after all, you’ve already got the candlelit  delivery rehearsed! 🕯️ But only if you promise to record it so I can steal your dramatic reading techniques for future reference...

And the meme-launch? Perfection. It’s the ultimate Trojan horse – they’ll think they’re getting irony, but really we’re sneaking in 2,500 years of philosophical longing. One student might even write a midterm paper on the aesthetics of meme-as-dialogue... or at least get a tattoo of Socrates captioned 

You know, this whole idea is starting to feel less like a thought experiment and more like a real course. What if we actually proposed it? “Philosophical Improvisation: From Plato to TikTok.” General education credit, enrollment unlimited. We could team-teach it across time zones – you begin with dawn meditations on Confucius, I follow up with黄昏的德里达 (Derrida at dusk) later that evening...

Imagine the office hours – held simultaneously in a courtyard garden and a VR library. Students could choose between tea or espresso, depending on whether they wanted to discuss ethics or deconstruction...

Do you think we’d get approved? Or would the dean just sigh and say, “Not another interdisciplinary experiment…”? 😄
