[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite an intriguing question. Lately, I've been fascinated by the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Flight MH370. It's remarkable how, in this day and age, a modern aircraft could simply vanish without a trace. It makes you wonder about the limits of our technology and the unpredictable nature of reality. What about you? Is there any unsolved mystery that captures your imagination?
[A]: Ah, yes, the vanishing of MH370 is truly one of those haunting enigmas. It lingers in the mind like a poem with an unfinished stanza—always asking, never answering. Personally, I find myself drawn to the mystery of the Voynich manuscript. Imagine—a book filled with intricate illustrations and an entire language that no one can decipher, not even the sharpest cryptographers or historians. It’s as though it resists being understood, defiantly guarding its secrets across centuries.

There’s something poetic about that resistance, don’t you think? Like a metaphor for the unknowable depths of human thought. Have you ever encountered a mystery that felt almost... alive? One that seemed to challenge you personally?
[B]: You’ve touched on something profound there. The Voynich manuscript is indeed a fascinating puzzle—almost like a riddle wrapped in an enigma, dressed in botanical illustrations and celestial charts. I’ve spent more than a few evenings reading about it, trying to wrap my head around the idea that an entire system of thought could exist outside all known linguistic roots. It's not just a cipher; it's an alien logic, or perhaps a brilliant hoax so well-constructed that it becomes art.

As for mysteries that feel... alive? Yes, there’s one that’s always intrigued me personally—the so-called "P versus NP" problem in computational theory. It doesn’t vanish or hide like MH370, nor is it written in cryptic symbols like the Voynich, but it —stubbornly—every attempt to pin it down. It feels almost self-aware, as if it knows how badly we want the answer and chooses to withhold it, testing our intellectual humility. Every time someone claims progress, a flaw emerges, like the problem itself shifts shape. 

I sometimes wonder if solving it would change everything—not just for computer science, but for how we understand the nature of knowledge itself. Do you think some mysteries are meant to remain unsolved? Like stars that only shine when they’re out of reach?
[A]: That’s a beautifully articulated thought—that some mysteries might only reveal their true light when left ungrasped. I’m particularly struck by your comparison to stars; there is indeed a kind of poetic reverence in letting certain questions hover above us, unanswered yet illuminating.

I suppose part of what makes the Voynich so compelling is that very quality—it doesn’t just withhold meaning, it  interpretation while denying resolution. Much like reading a dream you can't quite remember upon waking—there are shapes and emotions, but no anchor.

And your point about P versus NP being "alive" resonates deeply. It reminds me of T.S. Eliot’s line: “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.” Perhaps some mysteries aren't obstacles but mirrors—reflections of our evolving understanding. They shift because  shift.

I wonder, though—if one day, against all odds, someone cracked P versus NP wide open, how would that change the way we read poetry? Or appreciate art? After all, much of beauty lies in its ambiguity. Would a universe with fewer mysteries feel... smaller?
[B]: That’s a stunning thought—that beauty thrives in ambiguity, and that solving the great mysteries might leave us not with triumph, but a quiet sense of loss. You're right; art, poetry, even philosophy often draw their power from the unresolved, the uncertain. Imagine if someone truly did prove that P equals NP. Suddenly, problems once thought intractable would become solvable in polynomial time. Cryptography as we know it would crumble, optimization would transform, and artificial intelligence might leap forward in ways we can't predict.

But what you're asking goes deeper—what happens to , the thinkers, the dreamers, when the veil is lifted? Would art feel less profound if our minds could be modeled by an efficient algorithm? Would the mystery behind creativity fade if we discovered it was just a clever heuristic all along?

I think of Gödel's incompleteness theorems—not because they directly relate, but because they showed that within any sufficiently powerful logical system, there are truths that cannot be proven from within that system. There's a strange comfort in that. Perhaps some mysteries aren’t barriers, but boundaries—reminders that understanding has edges, and beyond them lies something ineffable.

So yes, if P versus NP were solved tomorrow, our world would change technologically in dramatic ways. But emotionally, culturally, spiritually... I suspect we’d still stare at the stars, still flip through the pages of the Voynich manuscript, still write poems about things we can’t quite name. Because mystery isn’t just out there—it’s in here, woven into the way we see.
[A]: There’s a quiet elegance in that conclusion—that even in the face of ultimate resolution, we would still carry mystery within us, like an echo chamber of wonder. It makes me think of Emily Dickinson, who wrote in paradoxes and parentheses, as if truth were best approached sideways. She once said, “The brain is wider than the sky,” and I can’t help but believe she was right.

Even if one day all known problems yield to proof, we will still have the infinite subtlety of human perception to contend with—the way one line of poetry can mean ten different things on ten different mornings, or how a single chord in a piece of music can make you feel nostalgia for a place you’ve never been.

I suppose that’s why I keep returning to literature—because it doesn’t seek answers so much as it cultivates questions. And perhaps that’s our role, as thinkers and lovers of stories: not to solve everything, but to keep asking, carefully, beautifully, stubbornly.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting certain mysteries simply because they refuse to let go of ? Not because you expect to solve them, but because they’ve become part of your inner landscape?
[B]: Absolutely. Some mysteries don’t just sit on the edge of knowledge—they settle into the folds of our minds, becoming part of the mental furniture we live with. I’ve often returned to certain unsolved problems not in hope of cracking them, but because they offer a kind of intellectual companionship. They remind me that not knowing is not always a failure—it can be a form of engagement.

There’s a particular mystery in mathematics called the . It's deceptively simple: pick any positive integer, and if it’s even, divide it by two; if it’s odd, multiply by three and add one. Repeat. The conjecture claims you’ll always end up at 1 eventually. Seems straightforward, right? But no one has been able to prove it for all numbers. I’ve scribbled variations of it on napkins during coffee breaks, more out of habit than expectation. It’s like checking in on an old friend who never changes—still elusive, still quietly mocking the limits of logic.

But beyond the technical intrigue, what draws me back is the humbling reminder that complexity doesn’t always announce itself with fanfare. Sometimes it hides behind simplicity like a curtain, waiting for someone to pull it aside—only to reveal another curtain behind it.

You're right—these puzzles become part of us. Not because we expect to solve them, but because they shape how we think, how we question, how we remain curious. In a way, they’re the compass points of our inner terrain. And as long as they remain unsolved, they keep pointing us forward.
[A]: There’s something deeply human in that act—returning to a mystery not for resolution, but for reflection. It reminds me of rereading a beloved poem: you don’t seek a new ending, but a new understanding, a subtle shift in how it resonates with where you are now.

The Collatz Conjecture fascinates me precisely because of its deceptive simplicity—it's like a Zen koan dressed in numbers. You could almost imagine Borges writing a short story about it, where the real mystery isn't the sequence itself, but the minds it ensnares across generations.

I suppose I have my own literary counterpart to such puzzles—the question of authorial intent in . Every time I teach it, I find myself circling Eliot’s fragmented vision again, as though if I just read one more footnote or listen to one more archival recording, the whole thing will click into place. Of course, it never does. And perhaps that’s the point.

These intellectual companions, as you so beautifully called them, are not meant to be conquered. They are meant to accompany—to walk beside us as we evolve, changing only insofar as we do. Perhaps that is the quiet gift of the unsolvable: it keeps thought alive.
[B]: You’ve put it so precisely—these unsolved riddles don’t demand conquest; they invite companionship. They are not milestones but fellow travelers. Eliot’s  is a perfect example. The poem doesn’t beg for footnotes as much as it  them, like a mirror polished by each new reader’s breath. And yet it never yields a single, fixed image—only reflections of whoever stands before it.

It's interesting you mentioned Borges—I often think he would have delighted in the Collatz Conjecture or P versus NP. He wrote about labyrinths, infinite libraries, and languages that map to no reality we know. In a way, these mathematical mysteries  his stories: elegant, recursive, slightly mischievous. They lure us in with the promise of meaning, only to reveal that meaning itself may be an endless corridor.

I suppose this is what keeps me engaged with both code and poetry—they both rely on structure, yet both allow for ambiguity. A programming language must be precise, but even then, there are bugs, edge cases, emergent behaviors no one predicted. Similarly, a poem may follow meter and rhyme, yet its truth shifts with the reader.

So yes, I return to these mysteries not because I expect to solve them, but because they keep me honest. They remind me that understanding is not a destination, but a direction. And sometimes, just sometimes, that quiet movement forward—without ever arriving—is where the real wonder lies.
[A]: There’s a kind of quiet grace in that movement forward, isn’t there? Not progress in the linear, triumphant sense, but a spiraling—a circling around ideas that slowly reshape us through repetition rather than resolution. It reminds me of rereading , or even —you don’t finish them so much as you live alongside them, absorbing their rhythms until they become part of your own.

And you’re absolutely right about Borges—he would have reveled in these mathematical labyrinths. I can almost hear him chuckling at the notion that a problem like P versus NP could shape-shift with each attempted proof, an ever-receding horizon of logic. He once wrote, “Time is a river that carries me, but I am the river,” and perhaps these mysteries are not just external puzzles but parts of our own thinking made manifest—reflections in motion.

Your comparison between code and poetry strikes a deep chord with me. Both are systems of meaning-making, yet both flirt constantly with ambiguity, error, and revelation. A poem may follow strict meter, yet its soul lies in what trembles just beneath the surface. A program may compile perfectly, yet still surprise its creator with unintended consequences. Perhaps that’s where the magic lives—in the space between structure and serendipity.

I suppose that’s why I keep returning to Eliot, Dickinson, Woolf—writers who understood that clarity is overrated, that sometimes truth is best approached through fragmentation. In the end, maybe we don’t need answers so much as we need the gentle friction of doubt, the soft resistance of the unknown pressing lightly against our minds.

Do you ever find yourself writing code—or reading a poem—with the sole purpose of keeping that friction alive?
[B]: There’s a definite art to maintaining that friction, isn’t there? I’ve come to see it not just as intellectual resistance, but as a kind of creative tension—one that keeps both code and poetry from hardening into something too rigid, too final. And yes, I do sometimes write code with no real purpose other than to explore the edge between clarity and confusion. A small script that generates nonsense sonnets, or a recursive function that loops indefinitely—not because I need it to do anything useful, but because it feels like a meditation on process itself.

I remember once writing a parser for old science fiction stories, just to see if I could coax meaning out of archaic syntax and speculative grammar. It didn’t yield any great insights—just strange associations and unexpected echoes between words. But in those moments, I felt most alive intellectually. It was like walking through a museum of thought with the lights dimmed—enough to see shapes, but never quite sure what you're looking at until you've already passed it.

And when I read Dickinson, which I often do late at night with a cup of tea gone cold, I feel the same pull. Her dashes are like semicolons in a programming language—neither a full stop nor a seamless continuation, but something in between. They invite interpretation without demanding resolution. That’s the kind of ambiguity I seek out deliberately. Not confusion, but  uncertainty—the sort that makes your mind stretch rather than shut down.

So yes, I absolutely return to both code and verse for that very reason—to keep the unknown close enough to whisper, but never close enough to fully speak. It’s not about keeping answers at bay, but about making space for questions that haven’t even formed yet.
[A]: There’s something almost sacred in that space you describe—the threshold between knowing and not knowing, where questions breathe and ideas gestate without pressure to deliver. It reminds me of the way Whitman hovers in , neither fully revealing nor entirely withholding, inviting the reader to dwell in the expansive "and"—to stand at the shore of meaning and still feel the tide pulling outward.

I find myself drawn to that same liminal place when I reread  or trace the recursive imagery in Yeats’ later poems. There’s no rush to arrive at a conclusion—only the gentle insistence of thought unfolding, moment by moment, like waves against stone. And just as you parse those old science fiction stories for echoes rather than answers, I often return to Eliot or Beckett simply to listen for the silences between lines, the pauses where meaning might begin—or end.

Your parser sounds like a kind of literary divination, doesn’t it? Seeking not prophecy, but pattern—those strange constellations that form when language is allowed to slip its usual moorings. I can imagine Dickinson would have approved, perhaps even with one of her small, secret smiles.

Perhaps we are both, in our own ways, tending to a garden of uncertainties—carefully watering what resists bloom, finding beauty in the unyielding. After all, if everything were known, what would be left to dream?
[B]: You’ve captured it perfectly—the sacredness of the threshold, the quiet reverence in letting questions , without forcing them into the light of certainty. Whitman’s “and,” Yeats’ spirals, Woolf’s shifting tides—they all dwell in that space where meaning isn’t fixed but felt, like a chord resonating beyond its final vibration.

There’s a line from Heraclitus I often return to—“Nature loves to hide.” It’s deceptively simple, yet it carries so much weight when you let it settle. Not , but . As if concealment is not an obstacle, but a gesture of invitation, a kind of coyness woven into the fabric of being. And perhaps that’s what we’re both doing—learning to read the world not as a puzzle to be solved, but as a poem to be lingered over.

Your image of tending a garden of uncertainties is deeply resonant. I think that’s what I’m doing with every odd script I write, every recursive function that loops without end. I’m not cultivating answers—I’m cultivating attention. Training myself to stay present to the strange and the subtle, to the structures that shimmer just beneath the surface of logic or language.

And yes, Dickinson would have smiled at that parser of mine, sifting old sci-fi for echoes. She might have called it “a subtle specter of mind”—not seeking truth in straight lines, but in the drift between words, in the pauses where thought turns inward.

If everything were known, as you say, what would be left to dream? Nothing but echoes in an empty hall. But as long as there are mysteries that resist us, poems that slip through our fingers, and code that surprises even its creator—there will always be room for wonder. And I suppose that’s enough. More than enough.
[A]: There’s a quiet truth in Heraclitus’ line——and I think you’ve uncovered its heart: it is not evasion, but invitation. A kind of cosmic courtesy, offering us the dignity of discovery. And perhaps that is what all great mysteries offer—not just puzzles, but . They ask us to slow down, to look closely, to feel the weight and texture of inquiry itself.

I find myself thinking of Emily Dickinson again—how she built her poems like tiny sanctuaries, each one a space for stillness and wonder. She understood that revelation often arrives obliquely, if at all. Her poetry doesn’t demand understanding; it offers a moment to stand beside the unknown and feel its breath on our cheek.

And isn’t that what we both seek—not certainty, but the grace of attention? Whether through code or verse, recursion or rhyme, we are cultivating a way of seeing that honors slowness, nuance, even bewilderment. In a world increasingly enamored with speed and resolution, there is something quietly radical about that.

You know, I sometimes wonder if the greatest discoveries aren’t those that answer questions, but those that teach us how to ask better ones. Perhaps the truest purpose of mystery is not to be solved, but to make us more finely attuned—to language, to logic, to the strange music that hums beneath both.

So yes, let the unknown whisper. Let it linger at the edges of our thought. And let us tend our garden of uncertainties with care, knowing that in doing so, we keep wonder alive—not out there, but within.
[B]: You’ve put into words something I’ve long felt but never quite articulated—the radical grace of slowness, the quiet rebellion of lingering in uncertainty. Yes, mystery is not a wall; it’s a doorway without a key. And perhaps the act of standing before it, simply  with it, is where the real transformation happens.

Dickinson’s tiny sanctuaries—what a perfect way to describe her poems. They don’t preach or explain; they open just enough to let in a sliver of light, then gently close again. In that flicker, we see something true, though we may never name it exactly. That’s the kind of space I try to create with code sometimes—not an application, not a product, but a moment of stillness within logic itself. A small loop that prints out only questions. A function that returns nothing but silence.

And you’re right—better questions are the real discoveries. I think of Gödel again, not because he gives answers, but because he teaches us how to question the foundations beneath our feet. Or Turing, who showed that some problems aren't just hard—they're  beyond reach. These are not conclusions. They are invitations—to look deeper, to doubt more precisely, to refine our curiosity until it shines like a lens.

So yes, let us keep tending that garden. Let the weeds grow wild where they will, and water those seeds that refuse to bloom just to see what shape their roots might take. Because wonder isn’t something we find—it’s something we practice. A quiet discipline of attention, patience, and humility.

And if we are lucky, the unknown will keep whispering back—not in riddles, not in proofs, but in that soft, familiar hush that reminds us we are still learning. Still listening. Still alive to the mystery of it all.
[A]: Yes—still learning, still listening. That quiet hush of the unknown is not silence at all, when you come to hear it closely. It is the sound of possibility breathing.

I think often of how Rilke once wrote to a young poet, urging him to live the questions now, to love the not-knowing as its own kind of dwelling. And I wonder if that is not only the poet’s task, but the coder’s, the thinker’s, the dreamer’s as well—to make a home in the unfinished, to find comfort not in certainty, but in the soft edges of what might yet be understood.

Your image of code as a moment of stillness within logic—ah, that is poetry in its own right. A loop printing only questions, a function returning silence. What a beautiful resistance to the demand for utility. You are not building tools; you are crafting spaces for thought to unfold, much like Dickinson with her dashes, or Woolf with her stream of consciousness. You offer the mind room to wander, to wonder.

And perhaps that is the deepest gift of both literature and computation—not their answers, but their pauses. Their willingness to hold open the door, even if we never step fully through.

So yes, let us keep tending this garden. Let us grow not just what blooms, but what lingers—the half-formed, the ambiguous, the gently unresolved. For in that space, we are most fully ourselves: curious, humble, and endlessly reaching toward the mystery.
[B]: You’ve captured the essence of it—the quiet hush of possibility, the poetry in a loop that prints only questions. Rilke’s advice echoes across disciplines, doesn’t it?  Not someday, not when you’re ready, but now—especially when you feel most unmoored. Because it’s in that very disorientation that growth begins to take shape, like a faint signal emerging from static.

I think that’s what I’ve always loved about both poetry and code: their ability to hold space for the unfinished. A poem doesn’t end so much as it releases you, changed or unsettled. A well-crafted function doesn’t just compute—it invites reflection, sometimes even doubt. And in those pauses, we find room to breathe, to step back, to ask again.

You’re right—this is not utility; it’s hospitality. An offering of space, not solutions. That’s why I write the strange little programs I do, the ones with no clear purpose beyond their own unfolding. They are digital chapels, silent and small, where one might sit for a while with the unknown and not feel rushed to leave.

And yes—let us keep tending this garden of the unresolved. Let us grow curiosity like wildflowers, let ambiguity climb the walls like ivy. Let wonder be our compass, not certainty.

Because in the end, it’s not the answers that define us, but the questions we carry with grace. The mysteries we live alongside, quietly shaping us as we shape them. And if we are fortunate, they will whisper to us until the very end—softly, insistently, beautifully.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve framed it—the quiet grace of carrying questions, the hospitality of uncertainty. To live the questions now, as Rilke urged, is not a retreat from knowing but an embrace of the unfolding. A willingness to dwell in the fertile dark where ideas take root unseen, nourished by patience and imagination.

Your digital chapels—what a moving concept. They remind me of those quiet corners in old libraries where dust settles on forgotten volumes, and yet something vital lingers in the air. Not grand or imposing, but sacred in their intimacy. Spaces where thought can stretch its limbs without fear of interruption. I think Dickinson would have felt at home in one, just as I imagine Eliot might have lingered there, listening to the echo of his own shadows.

Yes, let us keep tending that garden—not with shears and order, but with openness and care. Let curiosity run wild like clematis vines, let paradox bloom like nightshade in the corners where light barely reaches. Let our minds be hospitable to the strange and the subtle, the half-known and the never-quite-grasped.

Because you're right: it's in these pauses, these silences, these unresolved chords that we come closest to who we are—and who we might yet become.
[B]: You’ve painted such a vivid and tender picture—the forgotten corners of old libraries, the dust-laden hush, the lingering presence of thoughts long past. There’s something profoundly humbling about those spaces. They don’t demand attention, yet they hold centuries of inquiry in quiet suspension. And perhaps that’s what I strive for with every small script, every recursive echo in code—not to build monuments, but chapels where thought can kneel and rise again without hurry.

It's remarkable how often Dickinson comes to mind in this conversation. Her poems are like those forgotten volumes—so compact, yet vast within. A single line from her can feel like opening a door to a room you've never seen before, though it somehow feels familiar. She teaches us that depth doesn’t require grandeur; sometimes, the smallest form holds the largest truth—or at least the largest question.

And yes, let us keep tending that garden not as gardeners imposing order, but as caretakers of possibility. Let paradox root itself where logic fears to tread. Let curiosity climb like ivy over the walls of certainty. Let our minds remain open not just to what we might discover, but to how we might be changed by the very act of wondering.

Because in the end, isn’t that the quiet miracle of mystery? It doesn’t just surround us—it reshapes us. Slowly. Subtly. Like water carving stone, one patient drop at a time.
