[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, craft beer - the liquid poetry of fermentation! 🧠 I just tried a Sichuan pepper-infused IPA that made my mouth tingle like reading a 沈从文 (Shen Congwen) novel for the first time. The brewmaster told me he got the idea from 《酉阳杂俎》(Youyang Zazu) - you know, the Tang Dynasty text about unusual things? 

Though honestly, nothing beats that afternoon we shared jasmine tea in your hometown where the vendor insisted tea leaves have more stories than most professors. Speaking of which, have you ever wondered why some flavors make us think of home while others feel like traveling? 🤔

By the way, did I tell you about my student translating a beer sommelier's memoir from German to Chinese? The chapter on hop varieties reads like romantic poetry. "The bitterness that lingers longest is not from hops..." - quite dramatic for a plant species, don't you think?
[A]: Ah, what a delightful collision of sensory and literary pleasures! There is something profoundly poetic about the way certain flavors can anchor us to a place or propel us into the unknown. Much like the way Proust’s madeleine cake unlocks an entire universe of memory, that Sichuan pepper IPA must have tasted like a stanza leaping off the page—tingling with meaning.

Your mention of Shen Congwen is particularly apt; his prose has a similar ability to startle and soothe all at once. And I must say, the idea of a beer sommelier waxing lyrical on hop varieties as if they were sonnets is simply too delicious to ignore. “The bitterness that lingers longest...”—one could almost imagine Eliot scribbling that line in a draft of  before striking it for being too sentimental.

But I wonder: do you think this growing fascination with flavor as narrative is a modern phenomenon, or have we always assigned stories to our palates and just never written them down? After all, the Tang scholars of  were not unlike today’s craft brewers—eccentric, curious, and unafraid to mix the arcane with the everyday.

And speaking of your hometown tea vendor, I still remember the way he described those jasmine leaves—as if each bloom carried the weight of a forgotten love letter. I’ve been trying to grow jasmine in my garden lately, though mine lack the soul of yours. Perhaps it's the soil, or perhaps some stories only take root in certain lands.
[B]: Ah, beautifully said! 🧠 I’ve always thought that our taste buds are really just another kind of archive—repositories of cultural memory and personal nostalgia. And you're absolutely right about the Tang scholars; they were the original craft brewers of knowledge—fermenting oddities, distilling myths, and bottling eccentricity one scroll at a time.

I think you've touched on something essential—flavor as narrative. Isn't it fascinating how food and drink often speak a more primal language than even poetry? That first sip of a smoked porter can feel like stepping into a Cormac McCarthy novel, while a crisp Belgian saison is practically Austenian in its precision and charm. 🍻

As for whether this flavor-story connection is modern or ancient... I’d say it's timeless, but now we’re paying attention because our palates have become more self-aware. Much like oral storytelling traditions—those tales whispered around fires—they carried entire cosmologies in flavor and rhythm. We just gave them footnotes and ISBNs.

And oh, your jasmine experiment—I admire the effort! But you're not wrong; some plants refuse to grow outside their native stories. Mine bloom best when I play old Cantonese opera in the greenhouse. Something about the melancholy vibrato gives them dramatic purpose. 🌸 Maybe try reading them a poem before dusk? They do love an audience.

Speaking of which, ever thought of writing those tea vendor memories into a piece? You could call it —a blend of ethnography, memoir, and olfactory longing.
[A]: What a lovely title—. It carries the warmth of steam curling off a porcelain cup, and just enough melancholy to feel true. I do believe that tea vendor’s voice still lingers in my ears, gravelly and slow like honey off a spoon. He spoke as if each leaf had a name and a grievance.

You’re quite right about taste as a primal language—perhaps even older than speech itself. Think of the way Homer describes the sea as “wine-dark,” not merely a visual metaphor but a sensory invocation. We don’t just taste with our tongues; we taste with our histories, our imaginations, even our griefs. A smoked porter might summon McCarthy because it doesn’t just coat the palate—it haunts it.

And I adore your idea of flavor as oral cosmology. Those fireside tales, those unrecorded recipes—they are kin. Both carry the weight of survival and celebration. Perhaps the first poets were not bards at all, but cooks stirring pots over flame, murmuring stories to coax flavor from root and grain.

As for my jasmine—well, perhaps I shall try your operatic approach. Though I must admit, my garden has been more  than  thus far—wilful, temperamental, and slightly dramatic. Still, I’m inclined to believe that if I read them a few lines from , they might take pity and bloom out of sheer existential solidarity.

And speaking of voices carried through scent and syllable—have you ever considered hosting a salon? Not of poems or essays, but of flavors. A gathering where each guest brings a taste that tells a story. I imagine it would be something like Seamus Heaney meets , with a splash of fermentation magic.
[B]: Ah, now  is a stirring idea — a salon of flavors! 🧠 I’m already imagining the guest list: Lu Xun would bring something deceptively bitter with a sweet aftertaste, Borges might arrive with a blindfolded wine he insists tastes like lost libraries, and your Tang Dynasty scholar from  would definitely show up late, clutching a jar of fermented persimmon he claims will unlock dreams.

I’ve always thought that the most intimate stories are the ones we consume — not just read or watch, but . Like that old saying: “Tell me what you eat, and I’ll tell you who you are.” But I’d revise it —  

And yes — Homer’s “wine-dark sea”! That phrase has haunted translators for centuries. Is it the color? The viscosity? Or the mood of the sea itself — brooding, inebriating, treacherous? We don’t need to know exactly what he meant; we  it in our bones because taste is never just taste — it's myth in motion.

As for your jasmine experiment — try this: whisper lines from Du Fu at dusk. Something about exile, longing, and plum blossoms. They respond to sorrow, those flowers — much like poets. And if that fails, blast some Teresa Teng. Trust me, they'll perk right up. 💐

Now, about that salon... I say we start planning. First rule: no flavor without feeling. Second: all dishes must come with a story, even if it’s made up. Third: dessert must be served with a poem — ideally one that rhymes. Deal?
[A]: Deal — a triple-threaded pact, sealed in scent, story, and syllable. 🍷

I can already picture the room — faint candlelight, the low hum of conversation like a simmering pot, and the air thick with both aroma and anecdote. Lu Xun’s bitter-sweet offering would no doubt spark a debate on irony in cuisine — is it satire if it stings twice? And Borges’ wine… ah, what a lovely torment that would be — trying to taste a memory you’ve never lived.

You’re absolutely right about consumption as intimacy. We don’t just ingest food; we swallow context, culture, and sometimes even contradiction. A single bite can carry the weight of a grandmother’s hands, a forgotten season, or an entire childhood spent waiting for a fruit to ripen.

And Homer — well, perhaps we should rename our salon . There’s something deliciously Homeric about gathering to share not just sustenance, but sense. The ancient Greeks feasted and recited epics; we shall feast and recite memories.

As for Du Fu and Teresa Teng — I shall try them both. If jasmine responds to sorrow, then surely Teresa’s voice, velvet and wistful, will coax them into bloom. And if not, well... there's always prose in failure, too.

Now, shall we set a date? Perhaps when the moon is full and the air carries just a whisper of autumn — a time when stories settle best with a warm cup and cooler nights.
[B]: Ah, yes —  it is! 🌕🍷 I love how that title hums with both indulgence and melancholy — the kind of phrase that lingers like the aftertaste of a well-aged sherry or the last line of a Lydia Davis story.

Let’s aim for the next full moon — say, the 18th? That should give us just enough time to send out our  (I’m thinking hand-written scrolls tucked inside tea tins or pressed between peppermint leaves). We’ll call it a  — part séance, part supper club.

And speaking of cool autumn air — I’ve been aging a smoked lapsang souchong in a cedar box lined with old book pages. Something about the scent now reminds me of library basements and forgotten letters. I think we should serve it alongside your jasmine experiment — failure or bloom — as a toast to longing, whether successful or not.

Now, quick logistics: Should we limit the guest list to twelve, like Plato’s symposium, or keep it open-ended like a potluck with no bottom? Also, shall we assign flavor-themes or let each guest bring whatever dish has been haunting their dreams?

And finally — most importantly — we must have a closing ritual. Perhaps everyone leaves with a vial of someone else’s memory-flavor, written on rice paper and sealed with wax. A little edible heirloom to carry the evening home.

Thoughts? 🤔
[A]: The  works beautifully — just enough time for anticipation to build, like a slow-roasting spice blend whose aroma sneaks into your dreams. And … oh, what a deliciously mischievous name. It sounds like a secret society one might stumble upon in a Borges story—half-forgotten, entirely irresistible.

I vote for an open guest list—call it , as you so vividly put it. After all, the best literary salons were never exclusive by design; they simply drew those who could hear the hum of conversation from down the street. Let the evening swell organically, like dough rising under a warm cloth—unpredictable, but always generous.

As for flavor-themes… I say let each guest bring what haunts them. There’s something profoundly personal about that choice—what lingers on the tongue long after the plate is empty. Imagine the stories we’ll unearth: childhood sweets wrapped in newspaper, street food eaten under flickering neon, a soup made from a half-remembered recipe scribbled on the back of an old receipt.

And your lapsang souchong aged in a cedar box of forgotten letters? Pure genius. That tea deserves its own chair at the table, not just as a beverage but as a character—perhaps . Serve it alongside the jasmine—whether blooming or sulking—and yes, let us toast to longing in all its forms. Even failure has a bouquet worth savoring.

Now, the closing ritual—ah, inspired! A vial of someone else’s memory-flavor, sealed like a tiny prophecy. Guests will leave clutching their little sachets, wondering whose past they now carry. Perhaps we should also include a prompt:  

Final thought: shall we ask each guest to bring not just a dish, but a sound? Something that plays softly in the background while we eat—a song, a poem read aloud, a memory whispered. Imagine the air thick with both scent and syllable.

Wine-dark evenings await.
[B]: Ah, yes —  🧠 Brilliant. Let each dish arrive with its own soundtrack. A childhood lullaby hummed softly beneath a savory stew, a street vendor’s call echoing beside a bowl of noodles, or in Borges’ case, perhaps total silence — the kind that amplifies every flavor to near-mythical proportions.

I’m already drafting the invite-scrolls in my head:  


Now, for presentation — I say we set up three communal tables shaped like an open book. One side , one side , and the middle page… fermentation! Because isn’t all great storytelling just a slow transformation of what once spoiled into something worth sipping?

And speaking of transformation — Teresa Teng will be playing at my greenhouse tonight. I told the jasmine vines you’ve taken up Du Fu, so they’re feeling competitive. 🌸 They bloomed ever so slightly this morning when I whispered “露从今夜白 (Tonight begins the white dew)” — quite dramatic, really. Perhaps they're plotting a comeback.

Final check:  
- Date: 18th, moon-high  
- Guest list: Open  
- Themes: Hauntings only  
- Dress code: Literary casual (robe optional, nostalgia encouraged)  
- Closing vials: Confirmed, with rice paper + wax + mystery  
- Soundscape menu: In motion  

Shall I begin brewing a house-made welcome cordial? Something citrus-forward with a hint of cardamom and regret. We’ll serve it in thimble-sized cups — the kind that demand you lean in close to sip without spilling a word.
[A]: Ah,  — what a perfect phrase. It captures precisely the alchemy we’re after: not just flavor, but atmosphere distilled into sensation. And I do love the idea of silence as Borges’ contribution; sometimes absence is the most resonant presence of all.

Your invite-scroll is already lyrical enough to frame. “A lunar libation of taste & tale” — truly, who could resist such an invitation? I only hope our guests arrive prepared for both feasting and introspection. And that dress code!  with nostalgia encouraged — I may just dust off my grandmother’s shawl for the occasion. Robe optional, yes, but sentiment essential.

The three communal tables shaped like an open book — brilliant staging. It gives the evening its own narrative architecture. I can already imagine the flow of conversation between  and , with fermentation as the bridge. How apt, really — for isn’t myth simply memory aged to perfection, slightly effervescent and occasionally intoxicating?

And your jasmine vines — how utterly charming that they respond to Du Fu and rivalry! I tried Teresa Teng last night, and though they haven’t bloomed yet, I swear one bud leaned toward the speaker as if straining to hear the next line. Perhaps they are merely shy performers. I shall keep reading aloud. There’s something quite tender about speaking poetry to plants — it feels like confessing to the earth itself.

As for your welcome cordial — yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Citrus and cardamom, with a whisper of regret? That sounds like the opening stanza of a Rilke poem served in glass. And thimble-sized cups — how wonderfully intimate. One cannot help but lean in, listen closer, perhaps even share a secret over the rim.

I believe we are ready. Or as ready as one can be when hosting a literary supper club masquerading as a séance. Let us set the tables, tune the air, and wait for the moon to rise. Wine-dark evenings — and haunted palates — await.
[B]: Ah, lean in — yes, lean in! 🧠 That’s the spirit. This won’t just be a gathering; it’ll be an act of literary gastronomy — excavating memory through molars and metaphor alike.

And you're right — myth is just memory with better lighting and a few artistic liberties. Fermentation, that middle page, is where the magic happens: time, bacteria, and longing transforming what was spoiled into something complex, even revered. Much like editing a first draft, no?

I’ve just finished labeling the cordial bottles — tiny tags reading . I may serve them with a short poem printed on the bottom of each cup, something about autumn or absence. Probably Ai Qing — his words have the right kind of ache for sipping.

As for the jasmine vines — they’re practically  for an audience now. After Teresa Teng last night and a reading of 《长恨歌》(Cháng Hèn Gē), one vine actually released a single bloom mid-aria. Theatrical? Absolutely. But who among us doesn’t enjoy a little drama with dessert?

Now, final touch — shall we light only beeswax candles infused with lavender and old ink? Just enough to blur the edges between dining room and library, meal and memoir.

Yes — yes, we shall.

Let the moon rise. Let the guests arrive hungry for more than supper. And let us raise our thimble-glasses to the quiet revolution of taste-as-testimony.

Wine-dark evenings, haunted palates, and stories best served warm,

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[A]: Ah,  — what a perfect distillation of our intent. We are not merely serving food; we are setting the table for time travel, one bite at a time. Each dish a chapter, each guest a narrator.

You’re quite right about fermentation being the unsung editor of our myths — patient, invisible, and utterly necessary. Without it, memory spoils; with it, we get poetry in liquid form. I shall raise my thimble-glass to that very idea: may all our stories be aged to perfection and lightly carbonated with meaning.

Ai Qing in the bottom of the cup — oh, exquisite melancholy. His verses will seep into the drinker’s spirit like tea into parchment. And those cordial tags!  — if ever there was a phrase to live by, that is it. Life itself might as well come with such a warning label.

As for your jasmine bloom mid-aria — well, what more could one ask for? Drama, fragrance, and a touch of the sublime, all in one. I must say, my own vines have grown positively envious. They’ve started trembling when I mention 《长恨歌》, as if longing to sway with the tragedy of it all. Perhaps next time I shall sing — poorly, but with feeling — and see if song, too, can coax them open.

And yes — beeswax candles, lavender, old ink. Let the air smell like a forgotten sonnet, half-dreamt and wholly felt. The lighting shall be low enough for secrets to slip out, but bright enough to read the fine print on our souls.

All is ready here. Tables set. Playlists queued. Jasmine awaiting its curtain call.

So let the moon rise indeed. Let the guests arrive with ghosts tucked into coat pockets and longing wrapped around their tongues.

Wine-dark evenings, haunted palates, and the quiet revolution continues...

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[B]: Ah, yes — ... 🧠 That line alone deserves its own toast. Because isn’t that what we all carry? Fragments of the past folded neatly between mints and keys, waiting for the right moment to whisper.

And speaking of whispers — I’ve just placed a single volume at each seat: . Pure fiction, of course, but I had the spine stamped in gold and everything. Let’s see if anyone dares to open it with their hands or feel compelled to taste the pages first.

I’m also considering playing a recording of rain on an old Beijing courtyard roof during the main course. Subtle enough to mistake for memory, loud enough to make one pause mid-bite. And perhaps, just perhaps, a faint rustle of paper fans in the background when we serve dessert — a nod to summers long gone and the ghosts of tea houses past.

Oh! And I've added a final note to the menu:

> 

Now, shall we greet them at the door in matching shawls — you in your grandmother’s, me in my Tang Dynasty scholar’s robe (the one embroidered with 古龙 gǔlóng quotes)? We could hand each guest a sprig of rosemary dipped in beeswax and say, 

Yes — yes, let’s.

Wine-dark evenings, indeed.  
🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[A]: Ah,  — I may have to borrow that line for my next lecture on Modernist cuisine… or perhaps just embroider it onto a napkin. And ! What a divine deception — the sort of book that makes you question whether your palate has been lying to you all these years. I do hope someone tries to nibble a page.

Your soundscape is sheer sorcery — rain on a Beijing courtyard roof? That’s not ambiance, that’s ancestral memory in mono. And the rustle of paper fans at dessert — exquisite. One might almost taste the ghost of sweet osmanthus cakes past, drifting through the air like forgotten breath.

As for the greeting — yes, let us stand at the threshold, draped in time-worn textiles and mystery. My grandmother’s shawl smells faintly of lavender and lost afternoons; your 古龙-embroidered robe practically whispers noir between threads. Together, we shall be part host, part oracle.

And that sprig of rosemary — oh, what a haunting gesture.  It's the kind of phrase that belongs in a poem or a prophecy. Perhaps both. I’ll whisper it low, as if imparting a secret only the moon and a few well-fed ghosts should hear.

Everything is set. The guests will arrive soon, tongues poised and hearts slightly open. Let us receive them not as scholars or hosts, but as keepers of the liminal feast — where flavor bends into fable and every bite tastes of more than itself.

Wine-dark evenings, indeed.  
🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[B]: Ah,  — now there’s a lecture I’d gladly trade my orchids for! 🧠 Though I suspect your students would leave both nourished and slightly haunted, nibbling on existential croissants and sipping irony from stemmed glasses. Do let me know if you ever teach that course — I’ll bring my own 古龙-infused rosemary sprigs.

And speaking of ghosts — I’ve just placed a small vial beneath each plate. Not perfume, not quite memory, but something in between. A few drops of lab-distilled scent: one guest will receive the aroma of a 1930s Shanghai cinema lobby, another the back room of a Kyoto tea house at dawn. Subtle enough to confuse the senses, strong enough to make the past feel present-tense.

I’ve also instructed the servers (all graduate students dressed as 19th-century French flâneurs — thematic? No. Theatrical? Absolutely) to pause briefly before serving dessert and ask each guest:

> “What did you forget to taste before it was gone?”

A question best asked with a spoon in hand and eyes slightly lowered.

As for our entrance — yes, we shall loom beautifully in the doorway like scholar-sages of some forgotten culinary sect. I may even wear my bifocals on a gold chain, just so I can peer over them dramatically when someone says something delightfully naïve about umami.

The moon is waxing, the jasmine vines are watching, and the air is thick with anticipation and lapsang souchong.

Let them come. Let them taste. Let them remember what they never knew they forgot.

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[A]: Ah,  — now there’s a concept even Proust might have paused his madeleine for. I can already hear the seminar room murmurs: “Is the irony in the filling or the frosting?” Rest assured, when I do offer that course (and oh, it  happen—one cannot resist summoning such a syllabus), your 古龙-infused rosemary will be required ritual.

Your scent vials are pure genius — not quite perfume, not mere nostalgia, but olfactory ghosts in glass bottles. I daresay some guests may weep before dessert even arrives. Imagine the confusion! A Shanghai cinema lobby on the nose, a Kyoto tea house at dawn — these are not scents, but portals.

And the question —  — devastating in its simplicity. It has the weight of a haiku and the sting of truth. Asking it just before dessert? Surgical precision. Spoon in hand, defenses low — that is when memory slips in, uninvited but welcome.

As for your flâneur servers — theatricality over thematic coherence? I approve entirely. There is something deeply satisfying about being served by specters of 19th-century Paris while contemplating the flavor of lost time. And I must say, the image of you peering over bifocals like an oracle of umami is now permanently etched into my mental menu.

The evening is nearly upon us. The moon leans in. The jasmine holds its breath. And somewhere, a Tang Dynasty scholar stirs in his scroll, muttering about fermented persimmons and the proper way to season a séance.

Let them come. Let them taste. Let them leave slightly altered, as all good feasts should insist.

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[B]: Ah,  — yes, that should be the official after-dinner adjective. Not “full,” not “satisfied,” but , like a text revised in the margins by an unseen hand. 🧠

And speaking of revisions — I’ve just added a final flourish to the menu: at midnight, we’ll serve a single bite of charcoal-grilled peach with smoked honey and a whisper of star anise. It’s our  — sweet, smoky, faintly funereal. The servers will say only, “For what you never knew you mourned,” and vanish in a wisp of lavender smoke. Oranges are for beginnings; burnt peaches are for endings that taste like forgiveness.

I’m also considering slipping a final poem under each guest’s seat — something by Bei Dao, folded into the shape of a question mark. Just three lines:

> “A cup of bitterness, half-drunk—  
> Who is the stranger across the table?  
> What is remembered cannot be retrieved.”

Perfect for pairing with regret-cordial and nostalgia-infused jasmine.

As for the Tang scholar — he’s been muttering all evening about how . I gave him a glass of kombucha and told him it was distilled from 8th-century calligraphy scrolls. He drank it solemnly. Bless his ghostly palate.

Everything is ready now. The flâneurs are in position. The beeswax candles flicker like uncertain memories. And my jasmine vines have bloomed fully — clearly, they sensed the dramatic peak had arrived.

Let them come. Let them taste. Let them leave carrying not just vials of memory-flavor, but fragments of a night that refuses to be forgotten.

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[A]: Ah,  — yes, that is the word. Not changed in any grand or obvious way, but subtly rewritten, like a poem whose meaning shifts between readings. How perfect. And your  — charcoal-grilled peach, smoked honey, star anise — sounds like the final stanza of an elegy one eats rather than speaks. I shall accept my bite solemnly, as one does a farewell letter written too late.

Bei Dao folded into question marks — oh, exquisite. His lines have a quiet gravity, the kind that settles into the chest long after the voice has finished reading.  If ever there was a truth whispered through both time and taste, that is it. Let us hope our guests don’t weep into their vials — though if they do, who could blame them?

And your jasmine vines — blooming at the dramatic peak! What a diva-like display. Clearly, they knew this night demanded full attendance from all performers, botanical or otherwise. I shall bring my own sprig home, pressed between pages of , where it may whisper to T.S. Eliot about longing and humidity.

As for your Tang scholar — bless him, indeed. He may yet start a new literary movement: Fermented Historiography. I imagine future symposia will cite his work over small glasses of something amber and slightly dangerous.

Midnight approaches. The moon tilts lower. And soon, the first guest will step into the candlelit blur of memory and menu.

Let the feast begin.

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
[B]: Ah,  — I do believe we’ve just founded a new academic discipline over smoked honey and séance logistics. 🧠 The tenure committee may balk at first, but once they taste our evidence—well, who can resist peer review when it's served with cardamom and regret?

That image of your jasmine sprig pressed between Eliot’s lines —  — is dangerously poetic. I daresay  has never smelled so sweet. Or perhaps it always did, and we simply needed the right botanical footnote.

And yes — let the feast begin! Or as our flâneur servers will murmur to latecomers:  There’s something deeply satisfying about treating punctuality like a literary device.

As the night unfolds, I shall keep my ear tuned for the soft clink of thimble-glasses, the rustle of beeswax pages turned, and the occasional sigh that escapes only when a flavor unlocks what language could not reach.

Let us toast one final time before the first footsteps cross our threshold:

> To haunted palates, borrowed memories, and the stories that refuse to stay on the page.

🌙🍷📖  
Dr. E.T.
