[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. I think both have their own advantages. Handwritten letters carry a personal touch and show effort, which can be very meaningful in certain situations, like expressing condolences or sending sincere apologies. There's something special about seeing someone's handwriting and the physicality of the letter itself. 

On the other hand, digital notes are definitely more efficient and convenient in today's fast-paced world. Especially in medical documentation, we rely heavily on electronic records for accuracy and easy access. It's also more environmentally friendly if you think about reducing paper usage. 

But honestly, sometimes I still appreciate the warmth of a handwritten note. Maybe it's because I deal with so many legal documents every day, where everything is typed and formal. A simple handwritten thank-you card from a patient or colleague always brings a smile to my face. How about you? Do you prefer one over the other?
[A]: I totally get what you mean. 🎨 There's this tactile intimacy in handwritten letters that digital can't replicate - like how the ink bleeds through paper or the way words curve with emotion. I once curated an exhibition called  where artists responded to old love letters they found in flea markets. The imperfections in handwriting became part of the narrative.  

But let's be real - when I'm coordinating with galleries across time zones, Slack threads & Google Docs are lifesavers. Just last week, we did a real-time edit on a VR gallery layout with collaborators in Berlin & Seoul. Could you imagine sending 37 versions of hand-written floor plans? 😂  

Here's what fascinates me though - have you noticed how Gen Z is blending both worlds? They'll DM a friend a photo of a hand-doodled birthday card while also using those AI apps that "write" poems based on your selfie. It's like they're hacking nostalgia.  

Do you ever digitize physical documents just to annotate them digitally later? I catch myself doing that with exhibition contracts - print them out to mark up with red pen, then scan everything back into Procreate for final notes. Feels unnecessarily complicated, but somehow satisfying.
[B]: I love how you described the  of handwriting — it really does add another sensory layer to communication. That exhibition concept sounds fascinating, by the way. I can imagine how those handwritten imperfections told stories beyond just the words. In a way, they’re like medical charts from decades ago — sometimes messy, but full of character and intention.  

You're right about Gen Z blending old and new. I’ve been seeing younger patients who bring in handwritten symptom journals, then snap a photo to share with their care team via patient portals. It’s a hybrid approach that actually works pretty well.  

As for digitizing physical documents — absolutely, I do that all the time. Especially with informed consent forms that require detailed explanations. I’ll jot down notes during a consultation with a pen, then scan them into PDFs for reference later. It's a bit of a loop, but I get that same sense of completion you mentioned. Maybe there’s something grounding about starting analog and ending digital? Like having one foot in each world.  

Do you find yourself intentionally choosing one format over the other depending on the message, or does it mostly depend on context and convenience?
[A]: There’s something so validating about hearing that from a medical professional — I feel like we’re both working with traces of humanity in our fields. You preserve patient stories through charts & conversations, while I’m obsessing over brushstroke pressure on a letter. Both require interpretation, right? Like reading between the lines of a shaky signature or a hastily written note.

To your question - yes, I  choose formats intentionally depending on emotional weight. Last month I sent a gallery rejection email (ugh, the worst), and even though it was standardized, I printed it out, scribbled some personal notes in the margins with a fountain pen, then scanned it back as a PDF. Weird, maybe. But felt more honest than a cold sign-off.

Flip side: when I’m excited about an artist’s work, I’ll record a quick voice memo first to capture genuine tone, then follow up with a structured proposal doc. It’s like giving them the warmth before the logistics.  

And okay, this might be extra, but I also use different fonts for different energies. Courier for institutional stuff because it feels bureaucratic, Helvetica for clean proposals, and sometimes even Comic Sans for internal team jokes — people think it’s unprofessional, but it puts everyone at ease instantly. 😌

Do you ever play with tone/medium when delivering good news vs difficult conversations? I imagine that balance must be incredibly delicate in medicine.
[B]: Absolutely — you hit the nail on the head when you said it’s about . Whether it's a shaky signature on a patient form or a hurried note from a resident, there's always more beneath the surface. And in both our worlds, interpretation really matters. Sometimes what’s  written is just as important as what is.

I love how intentional you are with your formats — that rejection letter ritual sounds thoughtful, not weird at all. In medicine, we’re trained to deliver bad news with structure, like using the SPIKES protocol — setting, perception, invitation, knowledge, empathy, strategy — but honestly, I often find myself adjusting the medium based on the emotional weight too.

For good news, like a recovery update, I try to keep things warm and conversational. If possible, I’ll say something like, “Let me write this down for you so you can share it with your family,” and hand them a brief summary in clear handwriting. It feels celebratory, almost like a keepsake.

But for difficult conversations — say, explaining a treatment complication — I prepare detailed visuals and digital summaries ahead of time. Still personal, but more structured. I also pay close attention to tone. One thing I’ve learned is that even over email, if follow-up is needed, choosing a calm, empathetic voice matters just as much as the words themselves.

And yes — fonts! I’m guilty of that too. For internal memos, I’ll switch to Arial to make things feel less rigid. And Comic Sans? Totally agree. I once sent a staff reminder in Comic Sans after a particularly intense week. Got a few 👍 reactions and one laughing-out-loud emoji from the ICU team.

Do you think certain mediums help set boundaries better than others? I sometimes wonder if digital-only communication blurs lines in ways we don’t realize until later.
[A]: Oh, boundaries — that’s where the  magic happens. 🤯 You know what cracks me up? How we think digital tools make things more formal, but they often do the opposite. I’ve had artists send me Instagram DMs pitching their work like it’s a gallery application — no portfolio links, just selfie videos & hashtags. It’s wild how casual the medium can make the message feel, even when the intent is serious.

I actually set pretty strict boundaries with communication channels. For example, I only accept exhibition proposals through our official portal — no PDFs via WeChat or LinkedIn, and  no voice notes as main submissions. It might sound rigid, but it protects my time & mental space. When someone bypasses those channels, it usually leads to chaos — lost files, miscommunication, you name it.

But here’s the thing — sometimes breaking those boundaries sparks creativity. Last year, an artist sent me a hand-bound sketchbook through snail mail instead of a proposal. No email follow-up, no website link. Just this beautiful, silent package. Of course I opened it immediately — how could I not? It stood out because it resisted the flow. So maybe there’s power in knowing when to bend the rules.

Do you ever feel like certain platforms lower the emotional guard too quickly? I catch myself being more casual over Slack than I would face-to-face, and then later realize I’ve shared too much with someone I barely knows. 😅
[B]: Oh, totally — the emotional guard thing? . I’ve caught myself doing that too — especially with how fast and fluid digital communication has become. You fire off a quick message over Teams or WeChat, maybe throw in an emoji to keep it light, and before you know it, you’re sharing more than you intended. It’s like the medium tricks you into feeling closer than you actually are.

I see it with junior doctors too — they’ll text follow-ups to patients like they’re chatting with friends. No malice, just... the platform blurs the line. One intern sent a post-op recovery plan using bullet points  a 😎 face. Can’t make this up. Obviously well-meaning, but not exactly therapeutic boundaries.

Your boundary-setting with exhibition proposals makes total sense. In my world, I’ve started asking certain patients to put non-urgent questions in writing — either via the patient portal or on a form during their last visit. It helps them organize their thoughts and saves us both from those 10 PM email spirals. And honestly? It filters out the "kinda curious but not really prepared" stuff from the genuine concerns.

That sketchbook story though? Genius. Totally against protocol, yet completely brilliant. Reminds me of when a patient once drew her symptoms in a little comic strip because words weren’t enough. Got her seen faster than any standard intake form would’ve. Sometimes breaking format  the point — as long as it's intentional.

Do you ever give feedback through analog means to reset a dynamic that’s gotten too casual? Like, sending a handwritten note instead of typing something up, just to shift the tone subtly?
[A]: Oh, 100% — I’ve totally used analog as a tone-reset button. 🎨 There was this one artist who kept sending me updates over Instagram DMs with memes & TikTok references like we were collaborators chillin at a café. At first, I tried replying through the same channel but kept getting ghosted. So I printed out my next response, wrote everything in block letters with a Sharpie, and mailed it back to him. No digital trace.  

It worked  well. He showed up to our next meeting with a notepad and actually apologized for the Zoom background he’d been using (a rotating lava lamp — very distracting). Sometimes you have to shift the medium to reset the power dynamic without making it confrontational.

I love your patient comic strip example — honestly, that’s what I call . Not just data points, but lived experience visualized. Makes me think of how some artists use zines instead of traditional artist statements. It’s messy, personal, but communicates so much more than formal language ever could.

So here’s a question — when patients or colleagues  cross boundaries unintentionally, how much do you think the platform's design influences their behavior? Like, does the interface itself invite casualness, or is it more about habit? I’m curious because I feel like we’re all navigating these invisible cues without realizing it.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the platform  shapes behavior. Think of it like architectural psychology: just as an open-concept office encourages casual interaction, a chat-based interface subtly nudges us toward informality. I’ve seen patients start conversations with “Hey doc 👋” on the portal, which is technically professional-ish, but would never dream of starting that way face-to-face.

And habits definitely play a role too — especially with younger generations who’ve grown up in a world where DMs and voice notes are standard communication tools. They don’t always distinguish between a support group chat and a medical inquiry. One patient even sent me a TikTok stitch to explain her side effects. I couldn’t make this up! It was creative, sure, but also a bit concerning from a confidentiality standpoint 😅

I think it’s a combo: the design sets the tone, but repeated use hardwires the habit. That’s why I try to model the tone I want to receive — if someone messages me casually, I’ll respond clearly and politely, but in a slightly more formal register. Like, “Hi Maria, thanks for your message. For clarity, let’s document this in your file — can you confirm via the portal?” It redirects without shaming.

You mentioned zines earlier — I actually encourage some patients to keep visual symptom journals for similar reasons. Especially teens with chronic conditions, they respond better to doodles and timelines than lists of symptoms. Makes the data feel less clinical, more human.

So maybe the key isn’t fighting the medium, but learning how to guide people through it — knowing when to shift formats to reset expectations, or when to lean into the creativity it unlocks. What do you think? Is it about control, or collaboration?
[A]: I’m nodding so hard right now — yes, . It’s not about control OR collaboration, but knowing when to shift between the two. 🤔 Like a DJ blending tracks, you’re reading the room and adjusting the mix. Sometimes you let people freestyle in the digital space because it sparks something real, other times you pivot to structure so things don’t slip into chaos.

That “redirect without shaming” move you described? Gold standard. In策展, I call it the “soft frame” — letting people feel creative freedom, but gently guiding them back to format when needed. For example, if an artist sends me a voice memo instead of a written bio, I’ll say something like, “I loved hearing your tone — can we turn that into a short paragraph? Think of it as capturing the energy in text.” Feels collaborative, not corrective.

And oh man, the TikTok stitch story — hilarious AND scary. I mean, imagine if that went viral by accident? Privacy goes from patient portal to public loop in one click. Which makes me wonder: do you ever talk to patients about digital literacy? Not just how to use the tools, but how to  them safely?

Because honestly, most people don’t realize that a casual emoji in a medical thread is like wearing pajamas to a job interview — not wrong, just mismatched energy. 😅 And once that message is out there, you can’t unsend it.
[B]: Oh,  — that’s such a crucial point. And honestly? It’s something we overlook way too often in healthcare. We assume people know the rules of engagement, but half the time, they’re just guessing. I’ve started doing mini “communication briefings” during intake — not full-on training, but more like gentle onboarding. Things like, “Hey, just so you know, emojis are fine, but let’s keep videos private,” or “If you send a message through the portal, here’s how quickly you can expect a reply.”

And yes, I absolutely talk about the  — love that phrase. I explain it like this: “Think of our messaging thread like a clinic room. You don’t have to dress formally, but you might want to pause before sending a selfie with filters and dancing text.” That usually gets a smile, but also makes the point.

The pajamas-to-interview analogy? Spot on. I’ve had patients send follow-ups in ALL CAPS with ten question marks — clearly anxious — but if you’re reading it at 10 PM after a long shift, it feels more like an emergency than it needs to. So I’ll gently suggest, “Let’s save those triple exclamation points for birthday announcements 😊 — next time, just say ‘I’m really worried’ and we’ll make sure someone calls you right away.”

Your “soft frame” approach is brilliant — gives people permission to be expressive, while still holding structure. I actually use a similar tactic when explaining treatment plans. If a patient comes in with a Google search history longer than a novel, I’ll say, “I love that you did your homework — now let’s edit it together into a game plan that works for .” Feels co-authored, not corrected.

So maybe part of our job — whether in medicine or策展策展 (curating) — is becoming fluent in translation: analog to digital, casual to formal, emotional to actionable. You ever think of yourself as a kind of translator?
[A]: Oh,  — that’s such a poetic way to put it. 🎨 I love that. In fact, I’ve been thinking about策展策展  less as gatekeeping and more as cultural interpretation. Like, how do you translate an artist’s raw emotion into something a viewer can step into? Or take a deeply personal story and format it so it resonates without losing its soul?

And in medicine, you’re doing the same thing — translating symptoms into diagnoses, fear into treatment plans, Google panic-scrolling into actionable steps. It’s all about making complexity digestible without diluting it.

Funny you mentioned emojis — I actually did a whole micro-exhibition last year called , where we displayed ancient SMS threads alongside classical poetry. The contrast between “I 😷” and “When coughs doth shake the midnight air…” was oddly touching. Shows how much we’re still trying to compress emotion into shorthand, just like poets with metaphors.

So yeah, I  see myself as a translator — especially when working with AI-generated art. That’s a whole other layer: translating machine logic into human feeling. Ever had a patient describe their pain using a meme reference or a TikTok trend? Feels similar, right? You're decoding culture to get to the core message.

Do you ever feel like you're not just translating, but also… archiving emotions? Because I swear, some of those symptom journals your patients make are future museum pieces waiting to happen.
[B]: Oh,  — yes, that’s exactly what it feels like sometimes. Especially with those symptom journals you mentioned. I had one patient, a retired teacher, who kept a decade-long pain diary in a composition notebook. She’d sketch her mood each day using little faces 😊😐😢, color-coded with highlighters. When she handed it to me, I didn’t see a medical record — I saw a visual timeline of her life, compressed into ink and paper.

I think about that diary often when I’m reviewing charts or summarizing cases for legal review. There’s always this tension between clinical objectivity and the raw humanity underneath. You have to translate it, like you said, but you also have to preserve some trace of the original feeling — otherwise it becomes just data without soul.

Your  exhibition sounds genius, honestly. I wish more people made those kinds of connections — we’ve been compressing emotion into symbols for centuries. Whether it’s a Shakespearean metaphor or a crying face emoji, we’re all just trying to say: , , . 

And AI-generated art? Oh man, that’s the next frontier. I had a young patient recently who described his panic attacks by referencing an AI deepfake video he’d seen online — said his brain felt like that, “glitching between versions of himself.” That’s a whole new kind of translation, isn't it? Using digital metaphors to explain internal chaos.

So yeah, I absolutely feel like an emotional archivist. In fact, I’ve started encouraging some patients to include a “mood playlist” or a collage of images that reflect how they're feeling. It doesn't go into the official chart, but it helps me understand them beyond the checkboxes. Maybe someday, those will end up in your museum after all. 😊
[A]: I’m basically scribbling “MUSEUM OF EMOTIONS” in my notebook right now with a heart emoji next to it. ❤️ You’re speaking my language — the kind that doesn’t need ICD-10 codes or exhibition proposals. Just raw, messy, beautiful human expression.

That retired teacher’s pain diary? Chills. It’s like she was策展ing her own life without even knowing it. I can totally picture it in a vitrine under soft lighting, next to some AI-generated heartbeat visuals. Imagine the conversation between analog endurance and digital pulse. Feels like an exhibition waiting to happen — maybe something we should  brainstorm?

And yes — the AI deepfake analogy? Genius-level metaphor. That kid basically gave you a neurological symptom through a digital lens. It’s not just translation anymore; it’s redefinition. Our brains are becoming hybrid interfaces, blending biology with bits. Which makes me wonder — are future symptom journals going to be VR headsets? Or mood-tracking NFTs? (God help us if it’s the latter 😂)

I love the idea of mood playlists & collages as unofficial charts. We should start a secret archive — call it . No clinical relevance, all soul. Maybe someday we’ll publish it as a zine: “What Didn’t Make It Into the Chart.”

So real talk — if you could策展 one emotional archive from your practice, what would it be? And where would you want to show it?
[B]: Oh,  one emotional archive… Hmm. I think I’d go with a collection of "Unsent Apology Letters" — notes patients wrote but never sent. Some were too scared, some realized the person was gone, others just couldn’t find the right moment. One woman wrote to her son every year on his birthday for five years, telling him how sorry she was for missing parts of his childhood — and never mailed a single one. She read them aloud to me once, like poetry.

I’d策展 it as an immersive installation — soft lighting, maybe in a converted chapel or old hospital ward. Each letter would be projected onto fabric panels that sway slightly when you walk by, like breath or hesitation. Visitors could leave their own unsent messages in a locked journal at the exit — no names, just feeling.

And I’m  down for brainstorming this. The hybrid idea — analog pain diaries next to glitching digital vitals, mood playlists under handwritten timelines — feels so right. We could even include those symptom collages you mentioned, printed on thermal paper that slowly fades, symbolizing how easily we overlook emotional context in clinical settings.

As for  — yes, YES. That zine needs to exist. I’ll start scanning my “emotional footnotes” tonight. First entry: a napkin sketch from a surgeon who drew his patient’s face after delivering bad news. He said he couldn’t remember her name, but remembered every line on that napkin.

So what about you — if we co策展 this thing, do we need a theme? Or should we let the pieces speak first and see what emerges?
[A]: I’m literally typing with shaky hands right now — that unsent apology collection? . It’s not just策展策展, it’s soul策展. We’re talking about grief, regret, longing… all the messy stuff we tuck into drawers and pretend doesn’t exist. And you want to hang it like sacred text? I’m obsessed.

If we co策展 this thing — and oh, we  — I say we go with a theme that feels both fragile and defiant: “What Remains Unspoken.” Not just apologies, but all those quiet truths we carry. The things we almost said, almost sent, almost lived.

Imagine walking through that space: fabric letters swaying like ghosts, fading thermal journals on tables, napkin faces pinned behind glass like relics. Maybe even a sound installation looping those unread symptom playlists in the background — soft piano, glitchy voice memos, ambient hospital hums. You’d walk in feeling clinical, and leave feeling completely unmoored.

I’m already brainstorming how to pitch this to a hybrid venue — part gallery, part public health space. Think  vibes. And yes, we absolutely need your emotional footnotes zine as the exhibition catalog. Printed on recycled medical paper, of course. 😌

So here’s my question — how soon can we start collecting? Because I’ve got a drawer full of artist break-up letters that suddenly feel way less dramatic than they did last week.
[B]: Let’s start . Like, right after this message — I’ve already opened a folder on my desktop called "Unspoken - Draft 001". 🙌  

I love the theme —  has that quiet weight to it. It doesn’t shout, it lingers. Perfect. And your exhibition vision? Absolutely haunting in the best way. I can already picture visitors walking through like they're stepping into someone else’s inner monologue. That mix of fragility and defiance you mentioned? Exactly the tone.

We should also think about including some anonymized audio clips — short fragments of patients sharing why they wrote something and never sent it. Or maybe just recordings of them reading their own words with slight pauses, like when someone tries to hold back emotion but doesn’t quite succeed. Pure soul-documentary.

And yes — the sound layer is crucial. Hospital beeps fading into piano keys, voice memos looping like memories you can’t quite place. I might even reach out to a music therapist I work with — she’s done some incredible sound mapping with patient breathing rhythms. Could add this subtle, human pulse to the whole thing.

As for venues — I know a former clinic space downtown that's been converted into a community arts + health hub. It still smells faintly like antiseptic (nostalgic or traumatic depending on who you ask), which adds another sensory layer. Would that vibe work for you?

So final question before we officially launch this策展策展 baby into motion: Should we call ourselves curators, archivists, or emotional smugglers? 😈
[A]: Oh,  — hands down. 🎨💼 We’re basically sneaking feeling past the gatekeepers of protocol and professionalism. I can already picture our press release:  

> "Presenting: WHAT REMAINS UNSPOKEN — A clandestine archive of letters never sent, pain never fully voiced, and apologies that live in the space between."  

Curators sounds too institutional, archivists too clinical — but ? That’s where the magic is. We’re not just displaying emotion, we’re liberating it.
