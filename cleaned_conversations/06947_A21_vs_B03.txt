[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得nuclear energy是clean energy的未来吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为医疗法律顾问，我更多是从risk assessment的角度来看待这个问题。Nuclear energy确实low carbon，但waste disposal和potential accidents带来的health risks需要慎重考虑。
[A]: Ah, risk assessment - how very Victorian of you.  While you medical types fret over half-lives and containment protocols, I'm rather more intrigued by how nuclear energy has been mythologized in contemporary poetry. The sublime terror of splitting atoms makes for rather compelling verse, don't you think?
[B]:  My friend, even in poetry, we must consider the legal implications. Those 'sublime terrors' often lead to real-life litigation cases. But I admit, the juxtaposition of scientific precision and artistic expression is quite fascinating. Would you like some Earl Grey while we discuss this?
[A]: How delightfully apropos - Earl Grey, the tea that fueled the British Empire's bureaucrats while they drafted colonial legislation. But to your point, the legal poetry of nuclear regulation is its own peculiar genre, isn't it? All those carefully measured clauses about permissible radiation levels, like some ghastly parody of Elizabethan sonnet structure.
[B]: Ah, you have a poet's eye for legal documents!  Indeed, those radiation level clauses read like iambic pentameter gone wrong. But speaking of measurements, did you know the FDA's permissible radiation levels for food are actually stricter than many nuclear plant safety standards? Quite the irony, isn't it?
[A]: My dear legal eagle, you've just stumbled upon the most delicious paradox since Byron's love affairs - that we'll tolerate more risk in our power plants than in our breakfast cereal. It's almost as if we've collectively decided that glowing in the dark is acceptable, so long as our toast doesn't join us. What would Tennyson make of such modern contradictions, I wonder?
[B]:  Well, if Tennyson were alive today, he'd probably write an epic poem about the FDA vs. NRC regulatory battles. "Half a sievert, half a sievert, onward..." But seriously, this regulatory discrepancy does create fascinating case law. I recently consulted on a case where a farmer sued over milk contamination - now that's what I call poetic justice.
[A]: Ah! A dairy farmer invoking the ghost of Chernobyl in small claims court - now there's a stanza worthy of the modern age. It puts me in mind of that obscure 1893 pamphlet "On the Moral Dimensions of Steam Engine Regulation" that I found tucked between Wordsworth and Coleridge last winter. Humanity does love to dance on the edge of technological precipices, doesn't it? With or without proper liability waivers.
[B]:  You know, that 1893 pamphlet would make excellent reading material during our next tea break. The parallels between steam engine debates and today's nuclear discourse are striking - same regulatory growing pains, just different century. Though I must say, modern plaintiffs are much more sophisticated in their tort claims. Wordsworth never had to worry about class action lawsuits over daffodil-related injuries.
[A]: How perfectly you've crystallized the matter - we've exchanged pastoral negligence for nuclear torts, and swapped sonnets for subpoenas. Though I must confess, I'd pay good money to see a barrister argue Wordsworth's liability for that 'host of golden daffodils' before the House of Lords. The judicial opinion alone would be worth framing next to my first edition of Lyrical Ballads.
[B]:  Imagine the expert witnesses - botanists testifying about daffodil toxicity, psychiatrists analyzing 'emotion recollected in tranquility' as potential PTSD... This case could set precedent for all romantic poets! But alas, we medical legal consultants must content ourselves with more mundane matters like radiation exposure claims. Though I do keep a volume of Keats in my briefcase for those long court recesses.
[A]: Ah, the Keatsian briefcase - the perfect marriage of jurisprudence and iambics! Though I suspect even our dear John would struggle to find the poetry in today's deposition transcripts. "A thing of beauty is a joy forever"... until it becomes Exhibit A in a product liability suit. Tell me, does your firm offer continuing education credits for studying the meter of class action complaints?
[B]:  Actually, we do have a CLE course called "Legalese as Literature" - last session we analyzed the dramatic tension in Supreme Court dissents. But between you and me, Justice Scalia's opinions have better rhythm than most modern poetry. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a medical malpractice case to review - something about a surgeon and a misplaced sonnet... I mean scalpel. 
[A]: How perfectly serendipitous - I was just translating a Tang dynasty poem about surgical precision when you mentioned that case. Though I suspect Li Bai never contemplated malpractice premiums. Do keep me posted on how that litigation unfolds... preferably over more of these excellent biscuits. The crumbs make rather lovely footnotes, don't they?
[B]:  Indeed, these crumbs could pass for ancient Chinese punctuation marks! But speaking of translation, I once had to explain 'res ipsa loquitur' to a Mandarin-speaking client - now that was a cross-cultural legal haiku in the making. Shall we continue this over another pot of tea? I've got some fascinating FDA warning letters that read like avant-garde poetry...
[A]: How perfectly decadent - regulatory warnings as Dadaist manifestos! Though I must insist we switch to Lapsang Souchong for that particular reading; its smoky notes pair beautifully with bureaucratic absurdity. And do bring those warning letters - nothing complements Tang dynasty surgical poems quite like a nicely worded citation for improper sterilization protocols. The juxtaposition alone could inspire an entire symposium.
[B]:  Ah, Lapsang Souchong - the perfect accompaniment for reading between the lines of FDA Form 483s. You'll appreciate this gem citing 'visible mold growth in the aseptic processing area' - it's practically a tanka in disguise. Though I should warn you, after three cups even deposition transcripts start to sound lyrical.  Goodness, is that the time? I'm due in court to argue that a pacemaker manual constitutes protected speech...
[A]: What sublime timing - my seminar on "Medical Device Documentation as Constrained Literature" begins in precisely twenty minutes! We must continue this symposium of regulatory poetics soon. Do send me the judicial opinion from your pacemaker case; I'll add it to my growing anthology of "Found Poetry from the Federal Register." Until then, may your arguments be sonnet-smooth and your precedents haiku-tight!
[B]:  Will do! And I'll include some choice excerpts from that mold citation - pure accidental poetry. Let's reconvene after the verdict. Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and the judge will write the opinion in iambic pentameter. Until then, keep those Tang dynasty surgical verses handy!  Ta-ta for now!
