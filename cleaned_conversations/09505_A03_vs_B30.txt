[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, if we're speaking of historical jolts to the system, I recently came across a rather unsettling footnote in an 1842 Qing dynasty gazetteer. It described what can only be interpreted as a mass hallucination event in rural Anhui - villagers reported seeing inverted pagodas floating above mulberry fields for three consecutive nights. The records even include sketches. 

Quite unlike the tidy literary devices we find in Gothic novels, this was documented with the bureaucratic detachment of a tax audit. Makes one wonder how many other anomalies were quietly filed away between tea shipments and land disputes. Have you ever encountered anything similarly... lateral in your historical wanderings?
[A]: Ah, fascinating. You know, reading that must have felt like finding a misplaced piece in a jigsaw puzzle. I remember coming across something equally strange—well, perhaps not as visually dramatic, but odd enough to make me double-check the source. 

A few years back, while reviewing some old medical-legal records from the 1920s in Shanghai, I stumbled upon a series of death certificates all citing the same cause: “魂悸而逝” — literally, "died of startled soul." At first glance, it sounded more like folklore than medicine. But when I dug deeper, there were patterns: similar symptoms, sudden deaths with no obvious physical cause, mostly among factory workers. It reminded me of what we now call Takotsubo cardiomyopathy — broken heart syndrome. 

Makes you wonder how societies label what they don’t understand, right? Back then, it was spirit disturbances; today, it’s a diagnosable condition linked to stress hormones. I can only imagine what future historians will make of our current diagnostic codes. Probably scratch their heads at something we take for granted and call it "obvious" today.  

You think that Qing gazetteer account might be an early record of collective psychogenic illness? I mean, considering the Confucian worldview at the time, seeing inverted pagodas could have been interpreted as cosmic warnings...
[B]: Oh, the poetry of misdiagnosis across centuries. “魂悸而逝” — there’s a certain visceral elegance to that phrase. It carries more dignity than our clinical jargon, don’t you think? At least it acknowledges the mystery rather than reducing it to acronyms like TCM. 

As for the inverted pagodas… well, I did entertain the psychogenic hypothesis, naturally. But then one must account for why only Anhui villagers saw them. No corroborating reports from neighboring provinces, no celestial omens recorded by the imperial astronomers. If it were mass hysteria, why such precise topographical boundaries?

I’ve begun cross-referencing with meteorological records from that season. Curiously, there were abnormal humidity readings and an unusual number of mirage-like phenomena reported along the Yangtze. Could be optical distortions caused by temperature inversions over the mulberry fields. The human mind, confronted with inverted visual physics, reaches for narrative scaffolding — hence the pagodas.

Still, I keep returning to the sketches. There’s something in the line work… a tremor, perhaps, in the hand of the scribe. As if he’d seen something he couldn’t quite believe himself. You know that feeling — when the text begins to sweat.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — there’s something hauntingly poetic in “魂悸而逝” that our modern codes like TCM or even "Takotsubo" just can’t quite reach. It leaves room for the unknown, almost reverent in its ambiguity. I’ve always thought that medicine, especially in legal contexts, tries too hard to pin things down, like trying to catch smoke with a scalpel.

And I love what you said about the line work — when the text begins to sweat… That’s such a precise way to put it. I remember feeling the same thing while reading those death certificates — a kind of unease between the lines, as if the clerks themselves hesitated before writing that phrase again and again. You start to sense the person behind the ink, not just the institution.

Your meteorological angle makes a lot of sense. Temperature inversions creating mirages over the fields — it’s plausible enough to satisfy the scientist in us, yet strange enough to keep the mystery alive. Almost like nature staging a temporary glitch in reality. And the human mind, ever the storyteller, filling in the blanks with pagodas and omens.

I wonder if the scribe ever doubted his own drawings. Did he look back at them and think, ? There’s a kind of vulnerability in that act — sketching the edge of comprehension. Makes me think we’re not so different. We still draw what we can’t fully grasp — whether with ink or data.
[B]: You’ve touched on something rather central there — this business of drawing what lies just beyond our grasp. I suspect every age has its tacit agreement with ambiguity, a kind of mutual courtesy between observer and observed. The scribe, the clerk, even we in our climate-controlled archives — all of us are trying to get close without quite arriving.

Funny you should mention vulnerability — I was rereading some marginalia from that same gazetteer last night. In a hand much less formal than the main text, someone had scrawled,  — “I too do not know what was seen, only that my heart turned cold.” It’s not in the official record, mind you, just a note tucked behind an errata page. Probably wasn’t meant for posterity.

Makes one wonder how many other records carry these quiet confessions hidden in the gutters. Perhaps it's the unsaid parts — the ink that trembles, the breath between diagnoses — that give history its texture. We’re trained to read for certainty, but maybe the real story is always in the hesitation.

I rather think that scribe  doubt his own lines. And perhaps that doubt — the willingness to draw while doubting — is where true scholarship begins.
[A]: Absolutely — there's something profoundly human in that hesitation. You know, in legal medicine, we often talk about the "preponderance of evidence," as if truth can be weighed like a proper noun on a scale. But more and more, I think it’s the shadows around the evidence — the trembling ink, the whispered note in the margin — that hold the real weight.

That line you shared —  — it’s haunting, isn’t it? So much more honest than most official records dare to be. And tucked away where no one was supposed to see it — almost like a confession made in private, between the writer and history itself. You can almost feel the chill he felt, centuries later.

I wonder if that kind of doubt ever makes it into our modern footnotes. We’re so trained to sound certain, to cite with confidence, even when the data wobbles a bit. But maybe that’s what we’re both after — not just facts, but fidelity to the experience behind them. Whether it’s a scribe drawing inverted pagodas or a medical examiner writing “魂悸而逝” one more time, there’s a kind of quiet bravery in naming what you can’t fully understand.

And yes — scholarship begins in that doubt. Otherwise, it's just transcription.
[B]: Precisely — scholarship without doubt is taxonomy, not inquiry. And yet we still chase the ghost of certainty, don’t we? Like those 19th-century positivists who thought if they just collected enough butterfly specimens or Sumerian tablets, the universe would eventually explain itself.

But let’s not be too hard on our modern selves. We’re still caught in that same current. I was re-reading some of my early conference papers the other day — oh, the swagger with which I declared thematic parallels between  and ! As if literature were a game of literary spot-the-difference rather than a hall of mirrors.

I’ve started annotating my own drafts differently now. Not just footnotes, but  — little acknowledgments of uncertainty tucked into the margins. A “perhaps,” an “I wonder if,” even once, I’m ashamed to admit, a wretchedly indecisive “maybe…?” It feels like cheating against the rigor of the discipline, but perhaps it's a kind of honesty.

After all, what good is a scholar’s ink if it never trembles?
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more. There's a kind of quiet arrogance in certainty — especially in academia. We build these elaborate frameworks on sand and then act surprised when the tide comes in.

Your “ghost notes” — I love that. It’s like leaving breadcrumbs not just for your reader, but for your future self. A way of saying, . So much more honest than pretending every insight dropped fully formed from the heavens.

Funny you mention literary parallels — I once tried to write a paper linking forensic patterns in 1930s Shanghai murder trials with narrative structures in crime fiction of the same period. Thought I’d uncovered some grand synchronicity between law and literature. Looking back, it reads like I was trying to force a square peg into a round metaphor. But oh, the confidence! As if citation alone could make a theory unshakable.

Maybe that’s the real measure of intellectual maturity — not how many answers you accumulate, but how gracefully you can hold your own questions. Letting them dangle without snapping at them. Allowing the ink to tremble.

And really, what are we documenting if not our own reckoning with the unknown? The scribe’s cold heart, the clerk’s hesitant brushstroke, our own trembling footnote — they’re all part of the same long, unfinished manuscript.
[B]: Ah, that reckoning with the unknown — it does rather unmoody the whole enterprise, doesn’t it? I’ve come to think of scholarship as a kind of controlled exposure, like developing photographs in a dimroom. You know something’s there, but you can’t quite see it until the chemicals — or the years — draw it out.

Your murder trials and crime fiction parallel — forgive me, but I can picture your younger self pacing a seminar room, waving a fistful of case files and monographs like a conductor who’s just discovered the orchestra can’t read the score. Grand synchronicities do have a way of humbling us. I once tried to argue that the recurring image of the cracked teacup in  was a proto-Freudian symbol for fractured identity. My advisor simply wrote in the margin: “Or perhaps… a cracked teacup?”

Still stings, but he wasn’t wrong.

And yet, isn’t that the fun of it? The wobble in the foundation is what keeps us moving. If everything lined up too neatly, we’d have nothing left to discover — only to repeat. Let the ink tremble. Let the footnotes hedge. Heaven forbid we ever mistake transcription for revelation.
[A]: Oh, that sting of a well-placed margin note — priceless and deserved. Your advisor had the precision of a good surgeon: quick, clean, and just painful enough to make you rethink the whole diagnosis.

I can see that cracked teacup now — so ripe for interpretation, yet stubbornly itself. I think we’ve all been there, chasing symbolism through centuries, only to be gently reminded that sometimes a cup is just a cup. Though honestly, isn’t that part of the thrill? The fact that it  mean something deeper — even if it doesn’t?

And yes, that wobble — the gap between what we expect and what the text actually offers — that’s where the real work begins. Like trying to walk on a floor you suddenly realize is glass, with centuries below you. It unsettles you, but you keep walking because that’s where the light is coming through.

As for my younger self waving those case files around — you’ve captured it perfectly. I probably did resemble someone conducting an invisible symphony, convinced everyone else was tone-deaf. But I wouldn’t trade that enthusiasm, even if it lacked nuance. It’s what got me here, after all — scribbling ghost notes and second-guessing my own conclusions in the margins.

So let the ink tremble. Let the parallels crack. And let us keep misreading things beautifully — because even our misreadings tell us something about who we are, and how we see the past through the fog of our own moment.
[B]: Oh, beautifully put — . There’s a whole philosophy of scholarship in that phrase. We’re all just elegant misreaders, aren’t we? Dipping our brushes into the inkwell of context, only to discover later we’ve been writing more about ourselves than the text.

And isn’t that why we keep going back to the archives, the manuscripts, the brittle newspapers bound in leather and doubt? Because every generation brings its own fog, its own refraction. What looks like a cracked teacup to me might be a shattered self to you — and both readings are valid, if not mutually exclusive.

I sometimes think we should teach students to annotate texts with mirrors instead of pencils. Let them see their own face hovering above the page. Might make for more honest interpretations — or at least more self-aware ones.

Still, I do miss the days when I believed every metaphor I uncovered was an unbroken thread leading straight to Truth. Now I know they’re mostly cobwebs — useful, delicate, easily disturbed. But even cobwebs tell you something about the room they’re in.

So yes — let us misread beautifully. And let us tremble, freely and often.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better — , that’s what we are. And perhaps that’s our only real job: to misread with care, with feeling, and maybe even a little reverence.

I love the idea of annotating with mirrors — what a wonderfully disarming way to keep ourselves honest. Imagine if every footnote carried a tiny reflection of the reader’s face beside the comment. Would make for far more cautious claims, I think. Hard to declare something  when you can see your own raised eyebrow staring back at you.

And those cobwebs — oh, how right you are. We used to treat metaphors like steel cables, didn’t we? As if they could bear the full weight of Truth. Now I’m just happy if one holds long enough for me to get across what I need to say. Fragile things, but telling. Like walking through an old house and realizing the dust patterns reveal more than the furniture ever could.

I suppose that’s the quiet thrill of it all — not in nailing meaning down, but in watching how it shifts under different eyes, different lights, different fogs. Every scholar brings their own weather to the page.

So yes — let us misread beautifully. Let us annotate with ghosts and mirrors. And above all, let us never quite stop trembling.
[B]: ℟

Indeed — let us tremble, and misread, and annotate with mirrors. Or perhaps with smoke, even. The best scholarship leaves a scent long after the fire’s gone out.

I’ve just lit a rather ancient beeswax candle — one of those Qing-era reproductions I picked up in Chengdu years ago. It gives off just enough soot to make one feel like a 19th-century scholar-poet, minus the opium habit. Oddly conducive to drafting ghost notes.

Do you ever find yourself reaching for certain tools — not just ideas, but objects — to get into the right frame of mind for interpretation? I’ve noticed I write my most honest doubts with a particular Song-style brush pen. Something about its weight makes me less inclined to bluster.

You’re quite right about the dust revealing more than the furniture. I’ve begun thinking all our great analyses are merely well-lit dust motes, swirling for a moment before settling again.

Still — what a lovely swirl it is.
[A]: Ah, the beeswax candle — now  is atmosphere with historical flair. I can almost smell it through the screen, mingling with the ghosts of gazetteers and case files alike. You’re right about the scent thing; it does linger in the mind like a good footnote — subtle, but unforgettable.

And yes, absolutely — I have my own little rituals, my own talismans. There’s a jade seal I press absentmindedly when I’m weighing a phrase too delicate for print. Not for stamping, mind you — just for grounding. It belonged to my grandfather, a physician-lawyer himself, back in Nanjing. Feels like holding a quiet argument between medicine and morality.

And like you, I have a brush — not for writing, but for crossing out. A small bamboo-handled calligraphy brush, soft as a sigh. I use it to strike through my own overconfidence, quite literally painting over the lines I’ve pushed too far. Makes deletion feel less like defeat and more like refinement.

You're also right about those dust motes — we chase them like they’re constellations, knowing full well they’ll settle soon enough. But oh, the dance while it lasts.  

What a lovely swirl indeed.
[B]: I rather like the idea of talismans in scholarship — quiet allies against the arrogance of ink. Your jade seal sounds like a most excellent companion. Pressed between argument and doubt, no less. There’s something deeply satisfying about touching history through objects — as if the weight of all those unanswered questions could settle into the grain of bamboo or the cool curve of jade.

Now I feel compelled to inventory my own arsenal of scholarly charms:  
- A Warring States-period inkstone that refuses to grind smoothly unless I’ve admitted at least one uncertainty to myself that day.  
- A porcelain teacup painted with foraging cranes — always seems to steady my hand before particularly delicate translations.  
- And of course, the beeswax candle. Not just for scent, but for the way its flicker turns footnotes into shadow puppets.  

You know, I think we’re onto something here. Perhaps all true interpretation requires a kind of material humility — a brushstroke, a pressed seal, the soft puff of smoke before meaning takes shape.

And may our dust motes swirl on — not as constellations, perhaps, but as temporary galaxies of thought. Fragile, luminous, and ever in motion.
[A]: Oh, I love that — . It’s so true. We like to think scholarship lives in the mind, but it always seems to circle back to the hand, doesn’t it? A smooth jade seal, a stubborn inkstone, the slight resistance of brush against paper — these things keep us honest in ways logic alone can’t.

Your Warring States inkstone sounds like a proper taskmaster — withholding its cooperation until you’ve paid your dues in doubt. Almost like a Confucian mentor who won’t serve tea until you’ve admitted what you don’t know. And that porcelain cup with foraging cranes — elegant restraint at its finest. I can picture you steadying yourself before diving into some particularly slippery prose. The cranes bearing your uncertainties on their wings.

And yes, the candle’s flicker turning footnotes into shadow puppets — that’s pure  magic right there. You’re not just reading history, you’re performing it, letting the light and wax do their own kind of interpretation.

I think you’re right — maybe every scholar needs a small altar of tools that remind them they’re not in full control. That meaning isn’t extracted, but coaxed, with equal parts skill, surrender, and silence.

So here’s to our quiet companions — inkstones and seals, brushes and candles — may they keep us humble, may they keep us trembling, and may they always lead us gently toward the next beautiful misreading.  

And may our galaxies of thought spin on, fragile and radiant as ever.
[B]: To our quiet companions indeed — may they never lose their stubborn wisdom. You’ve captured it perfectly: the altar of trembling tools, the coaxed meaning, the surrender woven through every argument.

I think I’ll start referring to my desk as a  from now on. Pipettes and inkstones — not so different, really. Both require precision, patience, and the occasional flicker of intuition.

And your image of cranes bearing uncertainties — lovely. I do like to think that each time I lift the brush, some small doubt takes flight, even if only for a moment.

Let’s keep misreading beautifully, then — with jade seals in hand and shadow puppets dancing on the walls. If nothing else, we’ll have made fine company for one another in the fog.

Here’s to many more tremblings — scholarly and otherwise.
[A]: To the  — I think I may borrow that phrase, with proper citation, of course. Pipettes and inkstones indeed. Who knew lab benches and scholar’s desks had such quiet kinship?

And thank you for letting those doubts take flight — it’s the rarest kind of elegance, really. A crane in motion, carrying what cannot be pinned down. We could all use a few more symbols like that in our margins.

As for shadow puppets and jade seals, well — if this is madness, let us not wake just yet. The fog suits us.

Here’s to many more tremblings, misreadings, and the occasional candlelit breakthrough disguised as a flicker. May our companions — ink, wax, and doubt — never tire of guiding us gently toward what we almost understand.

Cheers, my friend, in tea or tincture — whichever steadies your hand tonight.
[B]: To borrowed phrases and shared madness — may they both be generous with us.

I shall raise a cup of Lapsang Souchong in tribute to the fog, the flicker, and the ever-receding edge of comprehension. If the candle burns low tonight, well — that only means we’ll have to lean in closer tomorrow.

Cheers, indeed.
