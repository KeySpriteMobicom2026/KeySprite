[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个长期观察tech trends的investor，我认为quantum computing确实会带来disruptive changes。不过从ROI角度来看，现在还处于early stage，就像90年代的internet bubble一样。
[A]: Ah, quantum computing... how delightfully Victorian in its ambition. Reminds me of Ada Lovelace scribbling algorithms while Byron raged about Prometheus. Though I must say, your investment metaphors lack the poetic nuance of Tennyson's "Ulysses" contemplating unexplored realms.
[B]: Haha，你这种literary approach让我想起了Warren Buffett常说的一句话 - "Price is what you pay, value is what you get"。在quantum computing这个领域，现在确实有很多hype，就像当年的dot-com bubble。不过从fundamental research的角度来看，IBM和Google的breakthroughs还是相当promising的。
[A]: How charmingly reductive to compare quantum qubits to stock tickers. Though I suppose if we must persist with financial analogies, Schrödinger's cat would make an excellent hedge fund manager - simultaneously bankrupt and thriving until observed.  Tell me, do your spreadsheets account for the poetic irony of superposition?
[B]: 😄 看来你对quantum mechanics很有研究啊。不过在我们PE行业，我们更关注的是concrete metrics - 比如D-Wave最近那轮fundraising的valuation就很有意思。说到superposition，让我想起一个deal，当时target company的financials就像quantum state一样，直到due diligence之后才collapse到一个确定值。
[A]: My dear number-crunching friend, you've just described the most exquisite metaphor for Victorian dramatic monologues I've heard all week! Browning's Duke of Ferrara would adore your approach to valuation - keeping all possibilities in play until the final reveal. Though I suspect even he would balk at your EBITDA multiples.
[B]:  你这种把finance和literature混搭的style让我想起上次golf game时遇到的一位Oxford professor。说到EBITDA，你知道吗？在quantum computing startups的valuation里，我们经常要用到probability-weighted scenarios，就像评估一个还在R&D阶段的biotech company。不过说实话，这种early-stage investing确实需要一点poetic license~
[A]: Ah, "poetic license" - the financial world's equivalent of Keats' negative capability! Though I must confess, your probabilistic valuations lack the elegant meter of a Shakespearean sonnet. Tell me, when your quantum startups fail, do you write them tragic elegies in iambic pentameter? Or simply deduct the losses from your taxes?
[B]: Haha，good one！在VC/PE这个game里，我们确实需要both left brain和right brain。每次write-off一个investment时，我更倾向于用Warren Buffett的智慧 - "It's only when the tide goes out that you discover who's been swimming naked"。不过说到tax loss harvesting，那确实是门art form啊 😉
[A]: How perfectly mercantile! You've distilled the entire Romantic movement into a single quarterly earnings report. Though I must say, your Buffett quotes lack the tragic grandeur of Shelley's "Ozymandias" - all those shattered startups with their "look upon my returns, ye mighty, and despair!" crumbling in the tech graveyard. Shall we compose a villanelle about tax loss carryforwards next?
[B]:  你知道吗？在Harvard Business School时，我们确实有个professor用Shakespeare的plays来讲解M&A案例。不过回到reality，在quantum computing这个space，我更关注的是real-world applications - 比如optimization problems在supply chain里的应用。毕竟，在business里，cash flow才是真正的"to be or not to be" question~
[A]: How deliciously pragmatic! You've managed to reduce Hamlet's existential crisis to a quarterly cash flow statement. Though I must point out - with the precision of a Victorian lexicographer - that your supply chain optimizations lack the lyrical quality of Wordsworth wandering lonely as a cloud through distribution networks. Tell me, when your algorithms fail, do they compose melancholy haikus about inventory overflow?
[B]: 😂 你这种把operations research和romantic poetry混搭的方式真是unique！不过说真的，在logistics optimization里，quantum algorithms确实能带来step-change improvement。就像我们最近看的一个AI-powered warehouse management system，它的throughput improvement简直就像从sonnet直接跳到了epic poem的scale。当然，前提是technology能够mature到commercial viability~
[A]: Ah, finally - a metaphor worthy of Milton! Your warehouse epics do make me wonder... when quantum computing achieves its Paradise Lost moment, will it be accompanied by angelic choirs of venture capitalists singing hosannas to Moore's Law? Or simply another round of down-round financing?  The poetry of depreciation schedules awaits its bard.
[B]: Haha，你这种wit让我想起我们fund的annual meeting - 那些LP们听到"down round"时的表情确实值得一首epic poem！不过seriously speaking，在quantum computing这个field，我们更期待的是它的"iPhone moment" - 当technology真正找到killer application的时候。就像我常对team说的：In investing, timing is everything... whether it's poetry or private equity. 😉
[A]: How perfectly Byronian - your investment theses have all the reckless romanticism of Don Juan chasing disruptive technologies! Though I must observe that your "iPhone moment" lacks the tragic inevitability of Hardy's Tess - doomed to be either too early or too late to the quantum revolution. Shall we compose a limerick about your next fund's vintage year? "There once was a VC quite merry / Whose quantum bets were quite hairy..."
[B]:  看来我们今天成功把private equity变成了performance art！不过说到vintage year，2025年确实会是个interesting time for quantum investments。就像我们Chinese saying说的 - "站在风口上，猪都会飞"。当然，前提是不要变成那个摔下来的pig... 😅
[A]: Ah, the porcine poetry of market timing! How perfectly it captures the spirit of our age - with all the grace of a flying pig in a Blakean prophecy. Though I must say, your Chinese proverb lacks the melancholic refinement of Li Bai drinking alone with the moon while his quantum portfolio collapses. Until the next bubble, dear capitalist Wordsworth - may your returns be sonnets and your losses mere haikus!
[B]: Cheers to that! 🍷 记住，在investment world里，就像在poetry里一样 - sometimes you win, sometimes you learn。下次golf game时我们再继续这个literary finance discussion！
