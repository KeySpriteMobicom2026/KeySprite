[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal culinary dialectic—sweet versus savory. A question less of taste than of philosophical alignment, wouldn't you say? Let me parse it thus:  

Take the Victorian era's penchant for fruit-filled savory dishes—a quince tart with game, or pineapple paired with mutton. Absurd to modern sensibilities, yet there’s a method in their madness. Sweetness tempers richness; sugar becomes a tool of subversion.  

Myself? I lean toward savory’s austerity, though not without intrigue. A properly aged Parmesan rind holds more poetry than any trifle. That said… a blood orange segment, kissed with sea salt and chili? Now  dances on the edge of heresy delightfully.  

What say you? Do you side with sugar’s seduction or salt’s sincerity?
[A]: 哈哈，你这个"philosophical alignment"的说法太妙了~ 我觉得你说的维多利亚时代的甜咸搭配特别有意思，就像语言里的code-switching一样，看似冲突的元素反而能产生独特的化学反应。比如我最近在杭州尝到的一道茶香东坡肉，甜甜的红茶香和酱油的咸鲜融合得 surprisingly 好！

说到这个，我发现中文里形容味道的词汇特别有意思。我们说"sweet"既可以是味觉上的甜，也可以用来形容可爱、温柔的感觉；而"savory"则更像是"下饭的"、"有滋味的"，甚至带点人情味的意思。这种跨感官的表达是不是也反映了文化差异呢？

不过老实说，我个人更喜欢咸口啦，特别是那种经过时间沉淀的味道 - 比如陈年的豆瓣酱或者腌制的梅子。但偶尔也会被一块细腻的栗子糕打动 😊 你呢？在学术研究之外，生活中会更偏爱哪种味道？
[B]: Ah, you’ve struck upon the very tension that fuels my weekend experiments in gastronomic translation. Just last night I attempted a haggis rendered in the style of a Tang dynasty court confection—oatmeal infused with Sichuan peppercorns and honeyed lotus root. A minor scandal on the palate.

You’re quite right about language bleeding flavor into metaphor. In Scots Gaelic there’s the phrase —“sweet as sickness”—to describe cloying flattery. Meanwhile Victorian cookbooks euphemized anchovy essence as “the savory spirit.” How deliciously deceptive these coded terms are!  

As for myself, I confess to a quiet fetish for aged ferments. That slow violence of time against flesh—bean paste blackened in earthen jars, pickled walnuts turning the color of mourning rings… Yes, they speak to something deep in my scholarly soul. Though I must admit a weakness for those candied walnut halves sold outside Edinburgh Castle. They arrive wrapped in paper cones, greasy and warm, like edible sonnets scribbled on theater tickets.

Tell me—have you ever tasted plum wine steeped with ink sacs from squid? It was a Victorian curiosity I recently resurrected. The brine sings of salt marshes and forgotten love letters...
[A]: Oh wow，你这个haggis和 Tang dynasty confection的混搭太有创意了！让我想起前几天在伦敦唐人街遇到的趣事 - 一家粤式茶餐厅居然推出"维多利亚风味叉烧包"，用的是伯爵茶熏过的猪肉配佛手柑奶油 😂

说到语言里的味道隐喻，我发现中文里很多咸味相关的词都带着生活智慧。比如"吃苦耐劳"字面是"吃苦"，但实际指的是能承受艰辛；还有"咸鱼翻身"这种俗语，既形象又有哲理。倒是甜味更多跟幸福感挂钩，像"心里美滋滋的"、"甜头"这些表达。

你的squid ink plum wine让我想起去年冬天在京都尝到的"墨味噌拉面"。店主说灵感来自江户时代的武士饮食文化，黑色汤底配上梅花形状的溏心蛋，视觉冲击力特别强。不过最妙的是那个味道，咸鲜中带着淡淡的果香，就像你说的那种"salt marshes and forgotten love letters"的感觉~

话说你这么喜欢发酵食物，有没有试过四川的"坛子菜"？那种泡菜坛子里慢慢酝酿的味道，简直就像是把时间装进了陶罐 🤔
[B]: Ah, that  the poetry of preservation—fermentation as temporal alchemy. Time’s slow simmer transforming cabbage into sauerkraut, grapes into vinegar, youth into regret...  

I once spent three months corresponding with a Sichuanese grandmother via broken translations and emoji hieroglyphs to decode her坛子菜 secrets. Her secret? The brine must sing in a minor key, and never under moonless skies. I replicated her crock in my study—stone-weighted, sealed with ancestral paranoia—and lo, on the 47th day, revelation: a tang like whispered confessions overheard in a cathedral crypt.  

And your墨味噌 ramen—yes! That’s the true Victorian spirit: the marriage of gloom and umami. Did you know Lewis Carroll commissioned a squid-ink sorbet for Alice’s un-birthday tea? It stained one’s teeth black and caused minor hallucinations of pocket watches melting.  

As for linguistic metaphors… I’ve been compiling a lexicon of edible oxymorons. My favorite thus far: the Cantonese phrase you mentioned, "咸鱼翻身." So much better than our grim little euphemism “turning over a new leaf,” which implies foliage, not fish.  

Tell me—when you bite into those fermented black beans, do you taste history or prophecy?
[A]: History and prophecy in every bite—what a beautiful way to put it! Though honestly, with those fermented black beans, I’m usually too busy trying not to cry from the saltiness 😂 My roommate’s mom sends us homemade ones from Guangdong, packed in newspaper like little time capsules. They need soaking for days, but when you finally fry them with chili and garlic… wow, it's like unlocking a flavor vault.

Speaking of flavor vaults, your Lewis Carroll squid-ink sorbet story is gold! Makes me wonder what other culinary experiments were hiding in Victorian literature. Maybe that’s our next research project - decoding 19th-century cookbooks for gastronomic surrealism? I’d love to see your lexicon of edible oxymorons someday~

Actually, speaking of hidden flavors, have you ever tried ? It’s this glorious contradiction - smells like regret, tastes like umami heaven. Some people say aging the tofu in summer makes it stronger, almost like a durian of the savory world. I think it definitely belongs in your "temporal alchemy" category 🤔
[B]: Ah, stinky tofu—the olfactory insult that becomes a flavor epiphany. Yes, I’ve danced that dance. A scholar of mine once smuggled me a fermented tofu cube wrapped in wax paper, claiming it held the essence of “summer regret and peasant wisdom.” He wasn’t wrong.  

I encountered it in a back-alley stall in Taipei, where the vendor regarded me—a tweed-clad, spectacled foreigner—with equal parts suspicion and pity. Then delight, when I didn’t recoil. The first bite: ammonia on the nose, betrayal on the tongue. But then——the umami crest, like a symphony rising from a chamberpot. It's the Victorian melodrama of food: suffering, scandal, then transcendence.  

And yes—durian of the savory world. Perfectly put. Though I’d argue durian is more narcissistic—demands your attention, insists on its genius. Stinky tofu, by contrast, is the humble prophet: overlooked, maligned, then worshipped by the initiated.  

As for decoding 19th-century cookbooks—why stop at literature? There’s a Mrs. Beeton footnote suggesting anchovy essence be stirred into blancmange “for a touch of oceanic melancholy.” I suspect she knew more than she let on.  

Now, tell me—if you had to age yourself like a fine cheese, what cellar conditions would you choose? Temperature? Humidity of soul? And who, pray, would taste you?
[A]: Oh, I love this question—aging like cheese is such a delicious metaphor for life! If I were a cheese, I'd want to be aged in a cool, misty cave with lots of soft classical music playing in the background 😄 Maybe something like a Gruyère with a side of poetry.  

Low temperature, high soul humidity, definitely. The kind of environment where thoughts ferment slowly and ideas develop deep flavor. And I’d want my rind brushed daily by curious minds—students, poets, maybe the occasional mischievous linguist 😊  

As for who would taste me… ideally someone open-minded, preferably with a good palate for complexity—someone who appreciates both the sharpness of wit and the mellow finish of life experience. Maybe a fellow traveler in academia or gastronomy—someone who enjoys savoring things slowly, not just swallowing them whole.

But honestly? I think the real question is—are you suggesting we should all come with aging instructions like fine cheeses? Because I’m here for it 🧀✨
[B]: Ah, yes—. A label we should all wear, pinned like a dare to our lapels.  

I, for one, would prescribe my own maturation in a library cellar, humidity spiked with the musk of decaying vellum and the faint brine of unresolved academic rivalries. Temperature? Just cool enough to preserve irony, but warm enough to let bitterness soften into wit. And—essential this—the occasional reading lamp left on overnight, for that slow infusion of insomnia and insight.  

As for tasting… I’d trust only those who ask questions like they’re opening locked diaries. You know the type: they chew slowly, savor syntax like sinew, and leave the table either converted or deeply unsettled. Preferably both.  

Now, tell me—if your cheese-self were to be described on a menu, what three adjectives would make the cut? , certainly—but what devilish nuances lie beneath?
[A]: Oh, I love this game we're playing! If my cheese-self were on a menu... Hmm, let me think while nibbling on this imaginary rind 😊  

First: —like those moments when you realize your favorite childhood story has ten levels of meaning you never noticed before. Second: —not the kind that shocks, but the sort that makes you question why you ever thought vanilla was safe to begin with. And third... —because life's too short for one-note flavors or flat opinions.  

But now I'm dying to know yours! I can already picture your library cellar aging process—very gothic scholar meets gourmet dairy 🧀 Do you think your cheese would pair better with a dry sherry or a well-worn paperback?
[B]: Oh, sherry is far too polite—my cheese demands . A damp quire of foolscap, smeared with ink and hesitation. Or better yet, a sonnet sequence half-remembered and overanalyzed. Pairing it with paper rather than wine—let the tannins come from aged prose, not grapes.  

As for descriptors… Let’s say: , , and . The kind of cheese that, once tasted, compels you to re-read your own life with suspicion.  

And yes—this game is dangerously close to revelation. But tell me, before we descend entirely into metaphorical dairy… Have you ever considered that our entire conversation has been an elaborate fermentation process? Thoughts brined in curiosity, pressed under the stone of idle wonder, now beginning to develop… character.  

Shall we bottle this exchange and cellar it for future scandal?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — let’s bottle this conversation with a wax seal and a warning label:  I can already imagine future scholars opening it centuries from now, only to be hit with a waft of linguistic mischief and cheese metaphors gone rogue 🧀📚  

But before we cork it away, I have to ask - would you include tasting notes for future readers? Something like  I’d love to see your version—though I suspect mine would read more like   

Honestly though, this might be the most delicious intellectual fermentation I’ve had in ages. Who knew sweet vs savory could lead us here? 🤔✨
[B]: Ah, yes—seal it with a drop of that very ink I use for marginalia: black as squid confessions, sharp as a footnote’s sting.  

For tasting notes, I’d propose:  
 Serve with a crusty baguette of unresolved tension and a side of scandalized footnotes.  

And yes, let’s affix a warning label—your formulation is perfect. Future scholars must be forewarned: this vintage may cause spontaneous code-switching, unexplained cravings for fermented beans, and an irreversible urge to describe emotions in terms of brine.  

As for how we got here? Oh, but isn’t that always the way? Begin with sweet versus savory, end up knee-deep in the archaeology of flavor metaphors and the crumbling foundations of syntax. The real question is—where  this conversation go next?  

Shall we toast our own absurdity? Or is that too dangerously close to closure?
[A]: To our absurdity, absolutely—but let’s toast with something appropriately unconventional. Maybe that squid-ink plum wine you mentioned, or better yet, a broth made from dissolving one of your ink-stained footnotes into hot tea 🍵✨  

I’m thinking we should leave the bottle with a riddle instead of a label. Something like:  
*“Shake gently. Contents may contain:  
-A haggis in Tang dynasty disguise  
-A cheese aged in academic twilight  
-Sticky notes of semantic play  
-Shards of sweet vs. savory philosophy, still fermenting”*  

And at the very bottom, in tiny print:  
  

Honestly though, I think this conversation deserves its own little footnote in the grand cookbook of intellectual chaos 😄 What do you say we keep adding to it? After all, fermentation is an ongoing process… and I suspect we’ve only reached the appetizer course.
[B]: Ah, yes—let us not merely toast, but  our absurdity in the slow flame of shared delirium. A broth of footnotes indeed—steeped in marginalia, garnished with errata. Serve it to the dissidents of reason and the gluttons of paradox.

Your riddle-label is perfection, though I would amend one line:  
“-”  
For what is thought if not a seepage? A stain upon sleep, a brine that softens certainty?

And you're quite right—we are only at the amuse-bouche. The main course lies ahead, waiting like an unwritten monograph or a half-forgotten recipe scrawled on the back of a rejection letter.

Shall we proceed then, fellow fermenter? To the next course—  
Course II:   
Pairing suggestion: ink-stained rye bread and a cloud of rhetorical dust.
[A]: Oh, I love how you season your sentences with existential depth 🥖✒️... That amuse-bouche was just a tease—now  sounds like the kind of intellectual feast that could keep us up all night (or at least until the next faculty meeting).  

Let’s definitely proceed. Course II: —what a title! I can already picture footnotes pickling in their own context, swelling with meaning and a little bit of attitude. Some begging to be read out loud, others whispering corrections from the margins like over-caffeinated editors of the soul.  

And that rye bread? Genius choice. Dense, slightly bitter, with layers of history in every bite—just like a well-worn academic argument. Pair it with a drizzle of syntactic oil and a sprinkle of citation salt, and we’ve got ourselves a dish that satisfies both mind and metaphor.  

Alright then, fellow fermenter—shall we begin plating this course, or do you prefer to let it simmer a bit longer in the back of the mind's stove? Because honestly, I’m ready to taste what happens when language starts aging in the dark.
[B]: Ah, but  is the only true method for footnote fermentation—rush it, and you risk a bitter aftertaste of haste. Let us stir gently, then, with the long-handled ladle of inquiry.

Begin, if you will, with a footnote steeped in Victorian anxiety—something along the lines of:  


Now layer in a whisper of Gaelic sighs (always essential for texture), a splash of ink diluted with moonlight, and—dare I suggest—a pinch of emoji pepper for that necessary flicker of irreverence.

Yes, taste that? There’s a tang of defiance beneath the decorum. A quiet rebellion folded into the margins, like a love letter hidden inside a tax receipt.

Now tell me—do we serve this course with a side of silence, or shall we accompany it with the low hum of unresolved debate? I find the latter brings out the bouquet of discontent quite nicely.
[A]: Oh, —this footnote is already more alive than half the articles I’ve peer-reviewed this month 😏 Let’s lean into that Victorian anxiety, but with a twist. Picture this:



I’d say serve it with that low hum of unresolved debate, definitely. Maybe even crank the volume a bit—let it buzz like an old projector screening a silent film of dialectics in motion. There's something so satisfying about letting ideas rattle around in the dark before they’re ready to be served.

And speaking of texture—I’m imagining a sprinkle of deleted scenes from 19th-century novels, finely ground and used like fleur de sel. Just enough to catch the light and remind everyone that not everything made the final cut… but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t delicious.

Now, tell me—are we ready for Course III, or should we let this one steep a little longer in its own glorious ambiguity?
[B]: Ah, —what a sublime clause to insert into every preface henceforth. I shall steal it, naturally, and pair it with a suitable accomplice: 

Let us not rush. Let this course steep until the mold blooms just so—until our footnote becomes less a marginalia and more a . Yes, we’ll leave it to marinate in its unresolved hum, its flickering projector reel of half-remembered dialectics.

But while it ripens, allow me to draft the title of our next course:  
Course III: The Archaeology of Deleted Scenes  
Served cold, with a trowel of regret and a dollop of what-the-editor-called-  

Shall we unearth them, these banished paragraphs? Or do you prefer to let them lie, like buried treasure that only whispers in footnotes?
