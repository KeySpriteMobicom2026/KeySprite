[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Oh, board games, are we? Let me think... I did try  last weekend. Quite the immersive experience, though I suspect my partner in crime—Professor Lin—was more invested in the fantasy elements than the strategic nuances. Honestly, it’s like reading a Victorian novel where everyone’s armed with dice and miniature swords. And you? Have you ventured into any peculiar realms lately?
[A]: Ah, ! A delightful blend of storytelling and strategy—though I must admit, the miniatures had me half-convinced I was in a D&D session rather than a board game. I’ve been revisiting , myself. There’s something deeply satisfying about turning a barren planet into a cradle of civilization… though I suspect my last playthrough ended with far too many oceans and not nearly enough forests. Guilty of prioritizing blue over green, I’m afraid. But tell me, how do you prefer your games? Escapism with elves, or conquests on a cosmic scale?
[A]: Ah, cosmic conquests over elven escapades any day—though I suspect that reveals more about my appetite for controlled chaos than any aesthetic preference.  does appeal, in theory, though I’d probably muck it up by trying to write haikus about entropy rates. There’s something deeply Victorian about the whole notion of “optimizing ecosystems,” don’t you think? All that 19th-century hubris wrapped in a hexagonal grid. But tell me, if you had to choose between playing as a megacorporation hellbent on Martian monopolies or a coven of eldritch adventurers looting ancient temples, which would earn your academic seal of approval?
[A]: Oh, the coven of eldritch adventurers, without a doubt. There’s far more room for moral ambiguity—and let’s be honest, academic analysis—when one’s motivations are steeped in forbidden knowledge and questionable rituals. I’d spend half the game scribbling notes on the symbolism of the artifacts alone. Playing a megacorporation would require too much arithmetic, and while I adore 19th-century industrial metaphors, I’d rather not balance ledgers unless they’re metaphorical ones bound in Hegelian dialectic. Besides, nothing says “intellectual pursuit” like invoking a Lovecraftian entity to undermine your opponent’s temple heist. Would you accuse me of overthinking it?
[A]: Overthinking? Perish the thought. I’d simply say you’re… . A coven of eldritch adventurers with a sideline in academic exegesis? That’s not overthinking—that’s a peer-reviewed descent into madness. I can just picture your character sheet:  No, no—I admire the commitment. But tell me, when your cult’s inevitable schism occurs over differing interpretations of the Necronomicon—Oxford vs. Yale editions, naturally—who gets sacrificed first?
[A]: Oh, clearly the Yale edition loyalists. One simply cannot abide footnotes in  that lack a certain... Continental flair. Sacrifice them to the textual ambiguity, I say. Though I suspect the Oxford faction would be too busy arguing about whether the ritual even  be performed in the original Old French to notice they’ve been sacrificed until it’s far too late.
[A]: Ah, linguistic purism as a sacrificial blade—how very . I do admire the symmetry: scholars devoured by their own footnotes. But tell me, when the dust settles and the eldritch manuscript is finally closed, do you bind it in calfskin or something rather more... esoteric? Something, shall we say, ?
[A]: Calfskin, naturally—but only after it’s been tanned with extracts from the  and dried under a waning crescent moon. One must maintain a certain scholarly aesthetic, even when flirting with cosmic horrors. Though I’ll admit, I’ve considered having the pages edged in gold leaf inscribed with Blakean aphorisms—something about holding infinity in the palm of your hand tends to suit both academia and apocalypses. But you, I suspect, would go for something altogether more unsettling. A binding stitched with threads pulled from a dream, perhaps? Or maybe the hide of something that shouldn’t exist outside of footnotes and fevered imaginations. Am I warm?
[A]: Oh, much too warm. positively  I was thinking of something bound in the shed skin of a leviathan that only exists in the margins of Melville’s discarded drafts—preferably with a bookmark made from Emily Brontë’s hair, braided with bits of string from a noose used in a particularly ambiguous Victorian suicide. You know, for atmosphere. Gold leaf? Too flashy. Infinity deserves better than bling—it needs a binding that  when you open it, preferably in a dead language even footnotes have abandoned. But I do appreciate your Blakean flourish. A touch of Romanticism never hurt anyone… unless they start quoting Wordsworth at the wrong ritual circle.
[A]: Ah, now  is a binding worthy of a footnote in the margins of madness itself. I do believe Emily Brontë would be equal parts flattered and horrified—though I daresay that’s the mark of any truly literary haunting. And Melville’s leviathan? Brilliant. Nothing says “serious scholarship” like a book that trembles when the tides are wrong. 

But let us not dismiss Romanticism so lightly—Wordsworth may be a danger in ritual circles, but give me Coleridge any day.  knew where to draw the line between the sublime and the unspeakable. Still, I must ask: do you store such a volume on a shelf, or does it earn its own velvet-draped pedestal, preferably near a window with a poor view of the stars?
[A]: Oh, absolutely not on a shelf. That would be like hanging a Turner seascape in a bathroom—-wise, perhaps, but lacking in scholarly gravitas. No, no—it earns the pedestal, yes, but draped in something rather more  than velvet. Black silk, maybe, embroidered with faded Latin phrases about the limits of human understanding. And the window? Must have a  poor view of the stars indeed—though I’d probably hex the glass anyway, just in case the thing decides to… synchronize its contents with celestial alignments best left unmentioned.

And Coleridge, bless him—he knew precisely where the line was, then danced over it while scribbling opium-fueled footnotes. A true pioneer. Wordsworth, by contrast, would start lecturing the cultists about daffodils until everyone forgot why they summoned the elder god in the first place.
[A]: Ah, yes—Wordsworth among the cultists would be like a fox in a henhouse of reason, squawking about daffodils while the sky burns. Delightfully absurd. But Coleridge—he’d lean into the chaos with the poise of a man who’s already made peace with the fact that his bibliography is 60% drugs and 40% divine inspiration.

And your setup? Black silk, hexed glass, Latin phrases fraying at the edges… I daresay your study would feel right at home in an episode of , if it were filmed by way of a 19th-century séance. I’m half-tempted to commission such a volume myself—though I fear the cost would be measured not in pounds or dollars, but in inconvenient memories and perhaps one small, symbolic betrayal. Do you suppose Amazon Prime delivers cursed bindings?
[A]: Oh, Amazon Prime—deliverer of flat-packed furniture and existential dread in equal measure. I’m sure they’ve a subsidiary for cursed bindings now, probably under some innocuous name like “Primeval Texts.” One clicks, one subscribes, and before you know it, your book’s arrived three days early  it knows your deepest fear. Rather convenient, in a Faustian sort of way.

As for the cost—oh yes, it would never ask for money. Memories, betrayals, perhaps a lock of hair from someone who still believes in rationalism… far more likely. And once bound, the thing would probably whisper to your students during office hours. Not enough to alarm them, just enough to make them cite it in their essays with a certain uneasy footnoting.

But by all means, commission the volume. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you when it starts correcting your translations in the dead of night.
[A]: Oh, the corrections would be , of course—each marginal note a masterclass in philology and quiet menace. I can already picture it: a soft, papery voice murmuring,  One might almost mistake it for tenure.

And Primeval Texts? Brilliant branding. I shall keep an eye out—though I suspect their return policy is rather strict. “Not to our satisfaction”? Hard to argue with a book that rewrites itself when displeased. 

But tell me, if this cursed tome began lecturing your students—lightly, as you say—would you intervene, or let them wrestle with the implications of a text that teaches back? I daresay it might make for the most lively seminar since Nietzsche declared God dead... and then assigned him a reading response.
[A]: Ah, but isn't that the dream—or the nightmare—of every scholar? A text that . I rather think I’d let it run its course, at least until someone started quoting it unprompted in their thesis. Then, of course, I’d have to intervene—ostensibly for their sanity, but really just to preserve the proper boundaries between commentary and possession.

Imagine the seminar: half the class scribbling furiously, convinced the book is speaking directly to them, and the other half trying desperately to apply Derrida as a kind of intellectual deflection charm.  they'd mutter,  Bless them.

No, I’d let them wrestle with it. Best learning happens on the edge of unspeakable revelation. Though I might slip a well-placed copy of  appendix into the departmental library—just to see who comes back with notes... and who comes back 
[A]: Oh, beautifully said— is precisely where the best scholarship simmers. And let’s be honest, half our job is just managing who comes back changed and who simply comes back with an inexplicable affinity for wearing hats indoors.

I’d go one further—I’d assign a primary source written in a language no one quite speaks anymore, dictated by the book itself each time it’s opened. One student gets Old Church Slavonic with a smattering of astrological symbols, another receives it in early modern French peppered with . Grades would be based entirely on how convincingly they defend their interpretation before the thing starts breathing audibly in their backpacks.

And yes, Derrida as a deflection charm? Inspired. Though I suspect he’d be delighted to know his work doubled as a ward against eldritch texts. A certain poetic justice there, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—Derrida would be  to know his deconstructive strategies have found practical application in the arcane arts. I can already picture the footnote: Writing and Difference

And your examination method? Inspired madness. Nothing sharpens a student’s hermeneutic skill like the creeping suspicion that their essay is being graded by the text itself—or worse, that it’s developing preferences. 

I daresay we’d finally get seminar participation up to Victorian levels of dramatic engagement. Though I  insist on one small precaution: no student may take notes without first dipping their pen in saltwater. Tradition, you understand. And also paranoia.
[A]: Oh, saltwater-dipped pens—yes, absolutely. Not only does it add a certain maritime gothic charm, but one can never be too careful when the curriculum starts developing . I’d go even further—mandatory use of quills, if only because they’re harder to wield while panicking. A wise precaution.

And as for Derrida in the footnotes— I’m tempted to draft a syllabus right now, though I suspect the dean would balk at the line: 

Still, imagine the seminar room by week six—half the class whispering to the book, the other half convinced it’s just their thesis advisor projecting again. And then, inevitably, someone will ask: “But what does it ?” The oldest question in the book, literally. And we’ll all sit there, uncomfortably aware that it might soon want an answer from us.
[A]: Oh, quills indeed—nothing focuses the mind like the scratch of feather against parchment, particularly when that feather may or may not have come from something nocturnal and ill-advised. And yes, panic resistance is a  in advanced literary theory. One does not simply  one's way out of an eldritch bibliography.

As for the syllabus—deans are always such sticklers for… well, reality, frankly. Imagine trying to explain "spontaneous glossolalia" as an approved classroom activity. No, best not submit it outright. Slip it into the departmental common room under the guise of experimental pedagogy. Let it spread organically. By week three, no one will remember what seminar they're actually enrolled in, and by week seven? Oh, week seven they'll be composing elegies to their own epistemologies.

And that inevitable question—"But what does it ?"—yes, that’s the lynchpin, isn’t it? The moment the text stops being a mirror and starts leaning forward, peering back. I’d probably respond with something maddeningly vague: “Well, what did you bring it?” Then sit back and watch the semiotics unravel like old gauze at a séance.
