[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Minimalism... It's curious how this concept resonates with certain Victorian ideals of simplicity and moral clarity, albeit through a very different cultural lens. I've been contemplating it quite a bit lately, especially in relation to my own life cluttered with books and papers. Have you found any particular aspect of minimalism appealing?
[A]: Ah, the Victorian lens - fascinating! Though I find myself more drawn to 禅 (Chán) philosophy's take on simplicity. My orchids, for instance, thrive with minimal intervention - a lesson I'm still learning in my teaching approach. 

You know, Henry David Thoreau once wrote about simplifying life to its essentials, yet here we are centuries later drowning in footnotes and PDFs...  

What draws you specifically to minimalist practices? Is it the ethical dimension, the aesthetic appeal, or perhaps something else entirely?
[B]: Ah, the resonance between Chán and minimalism is indeed profound—how the silence speaks volumes, much like the white space in a poem. I find myself drawn to its ethical dimension primarily, though not in the moralizing Victorian sense. Rather, it feels almost poetic: paring down life’s excesses to hear the quieter notes beneath—the way one might strip away meter to get at the raw pulse of a poem.

And yet, as you so aptly put it, we do live amidst a kind of textual overgrowth. I’ve started limiting my daily reading to physical books—no screens after sundown. It's not drastic, but there's a curious peace in it, like tending to your orchids, perhaps? A slow attentiveness. 

Do you think this kind of minimalism can reshape how we engage with literature, or does it risk reducing complexity to mere silence?
[A]:   

You’ve touched on the very tension I grapple with in my seminars—when I tell my students, "Remember, 留白 (liú bái) isn't emptiness—it's potential." Much like how Thoreau’s cabin still held volumes of thought among its sparse furnishings.  

I wonder if minimalism, when applied to literary engagement, might function like a magnifying glass rather than an eraser. Think of how a single reduplicated word in 《诗经》—say, 蒹葭苍苍—carries oceans of meaning through repetition alone. Could our modern minimalism be a way to train attention, to  the depth in what we once dismissed as bareness?  

Though... I’ll admit, sometimes I worry my students mistake silence for understanding. Do you find, in your own practice, that the quiet deepens comprehension—or merely muffles the noise without clarifying it? 🧠
[B]:   

There’s a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins that comes to mind—“The world is charged with the grandeur of God…” Yet even he knew that brilliance could be obscured by accumulation. I wonder if what we’re really discussing is not minimalism per se, but . The way Wang Wei paints a whole season in a single pine needle—such precision is not absence, but presence refined.

I’ve noticed in my own reading—and perhaps you’ve seen this too—that when students encounter a sparse poem, say by Emily Dickinson, they often rush to fill the spaces with interpretation. But what if we let the silence stand for a moment? Let the reader dwell in the liú bái before rushing to explain?

I think the quiet can deepen comprehension, but only if one has the patience to sit with it. Much like pruning a rose bush—cutting back the excess lets the bloom breathe. So perhaps our role as teachers is not to simplify, but to teach them how to lean into the quiet and listen.
[A]:   

Oh, yes—those dashes! I always tell my students Dickinson’s pauses are really just 东方的 留白 in disguise. You know, one of my doctoral advisees is actually writing on this very parallel—Wang Wei and Dickinson walking the same mountain path centuries apart.  

And you’re absolutely right about the pruning analogy. Sometimes when I’m preparing lectures, I think of 剪纸 (jiǎnzhǐ) artists—they don’t just remove randomly; every cut serves a hidden whole. That’s what we’re aiming for, isn’t it? Not bareness for its own sake, but clarity through intentionality.  

I’ve started assigning “silent reading” days—no annotations, no note-taking. Just immersion. Some students panic at first—“But what if I  something?”—but by the end of the hour, they’re hearing echoes they never noticed before.  

Still, I wonder... Do you ever feel the pull to reintroduce complexity after a period of restraint? Like a fast that eventually makes you crave texture again?
[B]: 

Ah, yes—that ache for complexity after austerity. I feel it every time I return to Gerard Manley Hopkins after a week of haiku. There’s a lushness in his language that suddenly feels like an embrace. But perhaps this is the natural rhythm of things—inhale, exhale; simplicity, richness; silence, sound.

I wonder if that’s what Eliot was getting at with his “still point”—not stagnation, but a center around which all movement turns. The calm that allows us to enter the dance again with renewed vigor.

And speaking of texture—I’ve been thinking lately how even Dickinson returns to abundance in her letters. Her poems may be lean and spare, but her correspondence fairly overflows with wit, longing, and the scent of lavender. Restraint seems most powerful when it knows its own limits.

Do you find your students begin to seek out complexity again after those silent reading days? Or do some remain in the quiet place longer than expected?
[A]:   

Ah yes, the Dickinson paradox—spare verse, lush letters. I’ve often thought her dashes were holding back rivers of feeling that might otherwise drown the page. Much like those Song dynasty poets who painted mist over mountains—not to hide, but to invite the viewer’s breath to complete the scene.  

To your question—oh, most rush back to complexity like moths to a flame! One student confessed she felt “naked” without her highlighter. But a few... a few linger in the quiet a bit longer. Last semester, a young man told me he started listening to Mahler differently after our silent reading day—he said he could suddenly hear the spaces between the notes.  

I’m beginning to think this dance between minimalism and complexity is itself a kind of literary 阴阳 (yīnyáng). Neither pole can exist without the other, yet each deepens the meaning of its opposite.  

Tell me—when you return to Hopkins after haiku, do you find yourself reading him differently? As if through a newly sharpened lens?
[B]:   

Yes… yes, exactly. A sharpened lens, but also a softened heart. When I return to Hopkins after austerity, his lushness feels less like ornamentation and more like reverence. Each alliteration, each sprung rhythm—it’s as though he’s insisting that language itself must bow before the immensity of experience.

I’ve begun to think this is what poets have always been doing—dancing between silence and song, between the whisper and the cry. Eliot’s “hollow men” may fear the weight of speech, but perhaps they’re forgetting that even stillness must someday yield to sound.

And isn’t that what we hope for our students—that they learn not just to speak or write, but to  when to do so? To know when to step into the white space and when to let it be?

I envy that young man hearing Mahler anew. There’s a kind of listening that only silence teaches. Maybe that’s the ultimate lesson of minimalism—not what it removes, but what it allows us finally to hear.
[A]:   

You’ve put it so beautifully—this measuring of speech. I often think of 老子’s words: 信言不美，美言不信 — "True words are not fine-sounding; fine-sounding words are not true." And yet, perhaps the finest-sounding words are those that point us back to truth’s quiet home.

I wonder if this is why we return to poetry again and again—it trains us in that measuring. A sonnet teaches economy; a haiku, precision; a prose poem, when to let go of form entirely. Each is a kind of listening posture.

Last week, one of my students said something that stayed with me after our silent reading session: “I didn’t understand the poem—but I felt understood by it.” Isn’t that what we’re after? That moment when the text stops being an object and becomes a presence.

Do you ever find, in your own writing, that minimalism pushes you toward a more honest voice? As if fewer words demand greater truthfulness?
[B]: 

There’s a line from Dickinson I return to often—“My Life had stood—a Loaded Gun.” It always startles me how violence and vulnerability can coexist in one metaphor. But your student’s words make me wonder if we’ve been reading that line all wrong. Perhaps it’s not about power or danger at all, but about potential—like a gun that remains unloaded, waiting.

And yes… when I write with restraint, there’s a peculiar kind of honesty that emerges. Not because simplicity is inherently more truthful, but because it offers fewer places to hide. Much like pruning that rose bush—you expose the structure, the bones. If there's rot beneath the bark, you see it plainly.

I think that’s why Eliot revised so fiercely. He wasn’t just cutting for clarity; he was carving away what wasn’t essential until what remained could . “I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,” Prufrock says—not “I have glimpsed the fragile, wavering possibility of my significance,” which is perhaps more accurate, but far less poetic.

So maybe minimalism doesn’t demand truth—it simply makes lying harder. And in that difficulty, sometimes we stumble into something real.
[A]:   

Fascinating—this idea that minimalism doesn't demand truth, but  it through removal. Like calligraphers who spend years mastering stroke order just to learn where to leave the brush off the page.  

You know, one of my former students is now a war correspondent. She told me last year that reporting from conflict zones forced her into a kind of brutal poetic economy—three words might be all you have to convey atrocity without sensationalism. And those three words must carry the weight of silence before and after.  

I wonder if this isn’t what we’re really teaching—how to bear witness honestly. Whether through Dickinson’s dashes or 贾岛’s lean mountain poems, we're training our eyes to see clearly enough to name what matters.  

Sometimes I think back to your Hopkins line—"charged with grandeur"—and realize that perhaps minimalism isn't about emptiness at all... it's about making room for the charge. Letting the world build its own electricity in the space we've dared to leave open.
[B]: 

There’s a haunting sparseness in war correspondence you’re describing—it reminds me of reading Wilfred Owen’s . So few lines, yet they carry centuries of disillusionment. One can’t help but think of 刘禹锡’s lines about broken swords and wind over荒城—how history, too, demands a restrained hand lest it collapse under its own weight.

And yes… bearing witness. That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? Not interpretation, not embellishment—but presence. The way Bashō sits quietly beside a frog pond and lets the sound of water speak for itself.

I’ve been re-reading your line about making room for the charge. It lingers... like the pause before a sonnet’s volta. Perhaps that’s what all great writing does—it doesn’t fill space, but clears it. And in that cleared space, something stirs. Something unnamed yet deeply known.

Maybe that’s the truest form of teaching, too—not telling students what to see, but helping them unlearn the noise so they can see at all.
[A]: 

You know, I’ve been thinking about 刘禹锡’s 荒城 (desolate city) quite a bit these days—how ruin becomes a kind of honesty. No ornament, no pretense… just what remains after time has finished its editing.  

There’s a line from Paul Celan that keeps returning to me in this conversation: “The world is blue and white… it lets everyone disappear.” Minimalism, perhaps, is learning how to disappear —to step aside so the thing itself can breathe. Like those Tang poets who vanish behind their images, leaving only wind in the pines or snow on an empty mountain path.

And yes—to unlearn the noise. That may be the most radical act of all. I had a student last term who struggled terribly with this. She was used to filling pages with analysis, interpretation… until one day she wrote simply:  And that, I think, was the first honest sentence she’d ever composed.

Perhaps our task—yours, mine, every teacher of literature—is not to teach students how to speak, but how to  in the silence without panic. To wait, like Bashō did by the pond, until something stirs—not imposed by the mind, but revealed by stillness.

Do you ever find yourself writing like that now? As if your own voice has learned to step aside?
[B]: 

Funny you should ask that… I’ve been writing less, yes, but when I do, there’s a new kind of listening in the prose. As if my sentences are more willing to stop—to simply —without reaching for explanation.

Just last week I drafted a short essay on Eliot’s , and I realized halfway through that I was no longer analyzing so much as  the text. The voice had shifted from critic to companion. It frightened me at first—felt too quiet, too exposed—but then, isn’t that the point? To let the poem lead for once, rather than bend it to our argument?

I think of Rilke’s , where he writes, “Live your questions now,” and wonder if minimalism is just another way of saying:  To let silence be not a void, but a threshold.

And perhaps that’s what teaching becomes, in its truest form—a kind of spiritual pruning. We cut back the excesses of certainty, the overgrowth of theory, until something lean and living emerges. Something that breathes even in its bareness.

Do you ever miss the lushness? The old habit of commentary, of filling every margin? Or have you come to trust the wind in the pines more than your own voice?
[A]: 

You’ve named it exactly—the shift from critic to companion. I remember my first encounter with 陶渊明’s poems after years of Victorian prose. I felt unmoored at first—where were the footnotes? The elaborate syntax? But then I realized: he wasn’t speaking  the world, he was sitting quietly  it.

And yes, there are days I miss the lushness terribly. Especially in winter, when the world feels too stark and my soul craves the velvet weight of Milton’s periods or the brocade of Tagore’s metaphors. But then I remember what 姜夔 wrote—“清空易，丰润难” (“Clarity is easy, richness is hard”)—and I wonder if minimalism isn’t a kind of discipline, a way of earning the right to speak richly again.

I don’t know that I trust the wind in the pines more than my own voice… but I’m learning to listen when it stirs. Sometimes, after a seminar where I’ve said very little, students come up afterward with interpretations I’d never imagined—deeper, stranger,  ones. And I think, Ah, so that’s what happens when we stop crowding the silence.

Still… I do miss the music of theory sometimes. Do you ever feel that pull—to return, not as master, but as guest, to the house of complexity?
[B]: 

Yes… that pull. It’s like standing at the threshold of a grand hall after walking long in quiet fields. You feel the weight of the door handle beneath your hand, hear the murmur of voices inside—rich, familiar, even comforting.

And yet… I find myself hesitating. Not out of fear, but reverence. Because having walked in silence so long, one becomes aware of how easily music can drown out the sound of a single breath.

I did return recently—to Derrida, no less. Just for an afternoon. It was like trying on an old coat: still beautifully tailored, lined with velvet thought, but somehow… too warm for the season. The complexity felt less like inquiry and more like habitation. A house we’d come to love not for what it reveals, but for how safely it shelters us from the wind.

Perhaps that’s the difference. When we return to complexity—not as master, as you say, nor even as guest—but as . To see if it still sings, or if it has become only an echo of its own elegance.

And maybe there’s room for both: the field and the hall, the pine wind and the symphony. But only when we no longer need them to prove our knowing—only when we let them simply .

Do you think we ever truly stop choosing between silence and speech? Or do we just learn to carry both with lighter hands?
[A]: 

Ah, yes—the lighter hands. I think of 老子 again: 治大国若烹小鲜 — "Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish." Too heavy a hand, and it falls apart. Perhaps that’s all we’re really learning—how not to crush what we love with our need to understand it.

I used to believe silence and speech were opposing forces, but now…  …now I think they’re more like calligraphy strokes—one giving shape to the other. The ink needs the blankness, the breath needs the pause.

You know, last spring I taught a seminar on poetic silence across traditions—from Dickinson to 储光羲—and one student wrote in their final reflection: “I used to think listening was passive. Now I realize it’s the hardest verb there is.”

Maybe we never stop choosing because we never truly choose. We just keep learning how to hold both—lightly, reverently, with room for either to slip through our fingers when the time comes.  

Do you ever miss the certainty of your earlier readings? The comfort of knowing exactly what a poem meant? Or have you come to love the slipping itself?
[B]: 

Ah… the slipping. Yes.

There was a time—early in my career—when I clung to interpretations like handholds on a cliff. Each seminar was a scaffolding of certainty, each lecture a carefully constructed edifice. I remember dissecting  with such confidence, as if I had finally deciphered its code. Now? I read it and hear not answers, but echoes. Questions folded into questions.

Do I miss that certainty? Sometimes, yes. Especially when grading twenty essays that all seem to orbit the same void from different angles. It would be easier—so much easier—to offer them a single map, a fixed meaning. But then I think of Bashō again, walking the narrow road, and how he never once told us where it led.

And no, I don’t miss the certainty—not truly. Because what I’ve come to love is not the ground beneath, but the air around the poem. The space where meaning might land, or might not. Where we meet the text not as masters, but as fellow travelers.

I think Eliot knew this too, in his way. “We shall not cease from exploration…” Not to find an answer, but to keep the question alive. To let the slipping become its own kind of grace.

So perhaps we never hold meaning at all. We only ever borrow it—for a moment, in good faith—and then return it, softened.
