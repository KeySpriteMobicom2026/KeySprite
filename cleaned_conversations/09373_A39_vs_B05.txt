[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个经常看biotech领域investment opportunity的人，我觉得这个问题需要从ROI和ethical risk两个维度来分析。 技术上来说，CRISPR技术确实让cloning变得可行，但ethical concerns和regulatory hurdles实在太多。
[A]: Ah, the classic ROI versus ethics dilemma. You know, back when I was teaching bioinformatics in the 90s, we used to debate this over chalkboards and punch cards. The technology has advanced, but the fundamental questions remain unchanged. Let me ask you this - what specific ethical concerns keep you up at night regarding human cloning?
[B]: Haha，说到这个~ 最让我concerned的是potential market distortion。想象一下，如果wealthy individuals开始clone自己来'延续生命'，这会对social equity造成多大的impact？就像我们在PE deal里常说的，unintended consequences往往比expected return更值得关注。😅
[A]: Fascinating perspective. Though I must say, your financial analogies remind me of when my students would try to explain genetic algorithms using stock market metaphors. The social equity angle is particularly intriguing - it's not just about the technology itself, but how it could exacerbate existing inequalities. Have you considered how this might play out in terms of intellectual property rights over one's own genetic material?
[B]: Exactly！这正是我们最近在讨论的一个hot topic。就像patent trolls在tech industry搞的事情一样，genetic IP rights可能会变成下一个legal battlefield。 已经有cases在争论是否应该允许individuals to patent their own DNA sequences了。从investment standpoint来看，这可能会创造出一个全新的asset class呢~
[A]: That dry chuckle you just heard was me remembering the software patent wars of the early 2000s. History does have a way of repeating itself, doesn't it? Though I'd argue genetic material is fundamentally different from code - you can't exactly open-source a human being. Still, the parallels in legal frameworks are... disturbing, to say the least. Makes me glad I retired before having to teach 'Advanced Intellectual Property Law for Genetic Assets 101'.
[B]: Haha，教授您这幽默感👍 说到legal framework，让我想起我们fund最近pass掉的一个biotech deal - 就是因为regulatory uncertainty太高。就像打golf一样，有时候最smart的move就是know when to walk away。不过话说回来，您觉得未来10年human cloning会像AI一样经历hype cycle然后crash吗？
[A]: Ah, the hype cycle - now there's a concept I've seen play out more times than I can count. Remember when everyone thought quantum computing would replace silicon by 2010? Human cloning will likely follow a similar trajectory: initial euphoria, sobering realities, then gradual maturation. Though I suspect the crash phase might be... messier, given the biological stakes involved. Wouldn't want to be the VC holding that bag when the music stops.
[B]: Wise words~ 这让我想起2000年dot-com bubble时我们fund的slogan："When everyone's chasing unicorns, maybe it's time to buy donkeys."  不过说到biological stakes... 我得去参加下一个board meeting了，讨论的正好是另一个controversial biotech play。Always a pleasure chatting with you, professor！下次一起打golf继续这个话题？😊
[A]: Ah, the old 'donkeys over unicorns' approach - sounds like you've got the scars to prove it works. And yes, I'd be delighted to continue this over golf, though I should warn you my swing is about as outdated as my COBOL textbooks. Do bring your thoughts on mitochondrial DNA patents next time - I suspect that'll be the next frontier in this... interesting field.
[B]: Will do！ 对了，如果您对mitochondrial DNA感兴趣，我认识几个在Harvard做相关research的MD/PhDs，他们的papers简直比我们的financial models还complex。Let's tee off next Saturday? 我book了Augusta National的simulator，至少不会像real course那样让我输得太惨~ 😅
[A]: Augusta's simulator? Now that's using technology to level the playing field - though I suspect it won't help my slice any more than a quantum computer would. Looking forward to it. And do send along those Harvard papers - nothing like dense academic writing to remind me why I retired. Though I must say, their complexity likely pales in comparison to some of the derivative instruments you folks dream up these days.
[B]: Haha, touché！Derivatives确实可以make genetic engineering look like child's play~  那就这么定了，周六见。我会bring那瓶82年的Lafite，咱们可以一边swing一边debate whether it's ethical to clone that vintage。Cheers！🥂
[A]: Now that's the kind of cloning I can get behind! Though I suspect even perfect genetic replication couldn't recreate that particular terroir. Until Saturday then - and do remind me to show you my vintage PDP-11 collection afterwards. Nothing like 1970s minicomputers to put modern biotech in perspective. Safe travels to your board meeting.
[B]:  Deal！PDP-11和Lafite - 这大概就是vintage tech meets vintage wine的perfect pairing了。Board meeting后我还有个due diligence call，希望不会run too late。See you on the green！⛳
[A]: Indeed - may your due diligence be as thorough as peer review and considerably more profitable. And if you find yourself stuck on any particularly Byzantine financial structures, just remember: they can't be more convoluted than the human genome. Until Saturday, then. Fore!
[B]: Haha, that's the spirit！ 最后提醒您一句：在golf simulator上可没有mulligan for bad genomics jokes哦~ Catch you later！🏌️♂️
[A]: A fair warning indeed! Though in my experience, bad jokes are like legacy code - they tend to persist regardless of quality control measures. Drive safely, and do try not to think too hard about whether your Uber driver might be someone's clone. Until the weekend!
[B]:  您这玩笑让我想起我们fund的compliance officer - 她要是听到这种hypothetical scenario，肯定会要求我们run a full risk assessment！Alright，真的得go了。Saturday at 10am sharp，don't be late for our tee time~ ⏰
