[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 这个问题很有意思。说到印象最深的movie台词，我不禁想起《肖申克的救赎》里那句经典的：“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.” 安迪在那样一个压抑的地方还能坚持信念，真是令人动容。你呢？有没有哪句台词一直留在你的记忆里？
[A]: Oh, what a splendid choice! That line always gives me goosebumps too. There’s something profoundly human about clinging to hope in the darkest of places. Speaking of memorable lines, I’ve always been struck by Atticus Finch’s words in : “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view… until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” It’s such a simple yet powerful call for empathy.

But perhaps my favorite, if I’m to be perfectly honest, is from a slightly lesser-known film — . When Mrs. Brisby tells the owl, “I’m not very brave,” and he replies, “Brave is not the absence of fear — it is acting in spite of it.” Isn’t that so beautifully true?

Do you have a particular genre or kind of film that tends to leave a lasting impression on you?
[B]: You know, that line from  resonates deeply with me as well. It captures the essence of courage in such a quiet yet profound way. And you're absolutely right — bravery isn't about having no fear; it's about moving forward despite it. A very Confucian sentiment, in a way — virtue through action.

As for genres, I find myself often drawn to films that carry a certain literary weight — stories that feel like they could just as easily be novels. Maybe it’s because I spend so much time in the world of text, but I’m particularly moved by dialogue that feels layered, almost like poetry with cinematography. Think of something like , where restraint speaks volumes. There’s a kind of elegance in understatement, don’t you think?

I suppose that’s why I appreciate台词 that linger not because of their volume or intensity, but because of what they reveal about the human condition. Do you find certain themes — like identity, loss, or redemption — tend to echo more strongly with you through film?
[A]: Oh, beautifully said. There’s something exquisitely moving about understatement in film — that quiet moment where a character says very little, yet we feel everything.  is such a perfect example; Anthony Hopkins’ portrayal of repressed emotion is nothing short of masterful. You’re right — it’s literature in motion, where silence becomes its own kind of poetry.

As for themes, I’m often drawn to those that explore the inner labyrinth of identity — especially when it’s tied to a sense of displacement or transformation. Films like  or even something more recent like  leave a deep impression on me because they peel back the layers of who we think we are, and who others believe us to be. It reminds me a bit of Dostoevsky’s  — that internal struggle between self-perception and reality.

Loss, too, holds a quiet gravity for me. I remember watching  and being utterly undone by how subtly it portrayed memory and longing. Sometimes it’s not a single line but the accumulation of glances, pauses, and fading light that makes a film echo long after the screen goes dark.

I suppose what I’m always chasing in film — as in literature — is that moment of recognition. When the art doesn’t just show us the characters, but reflects something true about ourselves. Do you ever find that certain films revisit you at unexpected times, almost as if they’ve been waiting for you to understand them better?
[B]: Oh, yes — that moment of recognition you speak of is precisely what makes film, at its best, a kind of mirror held up to the soul. I couldn’t agree more. And … ah, what a delicate yet devastating film. Its power lies not in what it tells us, but in what it allows us to feel between the frames — much like a haiku, where the silence between words carries as much weight as the words themselves.

You mentioned Dostoevsky — interestingly enough, I once showed a clip from , the film adaptation, to one of my comparative media classes. It’s fascinating how the fragmentation of identity in literature finds new life through cinema’s visual metaphors. Sometimes, we don’t truly grasp a story until years later, when life has given us the context we lacked before. 

And yes, certain films do revisit us — sometimes uninvited, sometimes needed. There’s a line from  that often returns to me: “I can't see anything I don't already remember.” It lingers because it reveals something unsettling about memory — how we cling to it, even when it hurts. Perhaps that’s why I return to Asian cinema so often; there’s a deep respect for impermanence and melancholy in films like  or . They don’t offer resolution — they offer reflection.

Have you ever rewatched a film years apart and found it spoke to you in an entirely different way? Like it had waited patiently for your heart to catch up with its meaning?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — that phenomenon never ceases to astonish me. I recall watching  by Tarkovsky in my twenties and being struck mainly by its visual grandeur and the sheer strangeness of its pacing. But then, years later, after a personal loss, I found myself returning to it — and suddenly, every candle, every whispered prayer, every silent gesture felt unbearably intimate. The film hadn’t changed, of course, but something in me had shifted.

It reminds me of rereading Proust — the text remains constant, yet we are different readers each time. And isn’t that part of what makes art so profoundly alive? It waits for us to be ready.

Your mention of  brings to mind Wong Kar-wai’s use of repetition and longing — how he captures that ache of almost-love, the tragedy of timing. There’s a line, or rather a moment — when Tony Leung leans against the wall in that narrow corridor, and you can almost hear his heart breaking without a word being spoken. That’s cinema at its most poetic.

I wonder — have you ever revisited a book or film and realized that your earlier interpretation was entirely mistaken? Not wrong, necessarily, but simply incomplete — like seeing only one side of a sculpture until life gives you the chance to walk around it?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive way to put it — "incomplete, like seeing only one side of a sculpture." That’s precisely what happened to me with . I first read it as a teenager and saw only rebellion and alienation. But when I returned to it years later, after teaching abroad and feeling estranged from my own roots, I saw something else entirely — not just Holden’s anger, but his deep, almost desperate yearning for connection.

It struck me then that Salinger hadn’t written a rebel without a cause, but a soul searching for meaning in a world that kept insisting on pretending everything was fine. That shift in perception changed how I approached the novel in my lectures. It wasn’t about correction — it was about depth.

And you’re quite right about Wong Kar-wai — there's a quiet elegance in his portrayal of unspoken emotion. Sometimes I think he captures the essence of  — lingering feelings — better than any poet. The corridor scene you mentioned? Pure cinema. No explosion, no confession — just two people standing close enough to feel the distance.

As for Tarkovsky — ah, … I’m reminded of his idea that art is an act of prayer. And when we return to it in different seasons of our lives, we bring new wounds, new questions. It responds accordingly.

I suppose that’s why I’ve always believed that great literature and film are never truly finished — they're merely paused, waiting for us to come back and continue the conversation. Have you ever found yourself haunted by a character long after the credits rolled or the final page turned? Not because of what they did, but because of what they made you question about yourself?
[A]: Oh, yes — profoundly haunted, in the best sense of the word. There are characters that don’t just inhabit the screen or the page but seem to slip quietly into your thoughts long after the story has ended. Marlow from  comes to mind — or rather, Coppola’s film adaptation, , where he becomes something more than a narrator. I remember sitting in silence after watching it for the first time, unsettled not by the horror of war, but by how easily one might lose oneself in it without ever raising a weapon.

What stayed with me wasn’t his actions, but his questions — and the way they echoed in my own mind: Who am I when no one is watching? What parts of myself have I left unexamined? That’s the mark of truly unsettling art, isn’t it? It doesn’t offer answers; it simply insists you look.

Another character who lingers, almost like a shadow, is Barton Fink. There’s something so deeply uncomfortable about his journey — the way ambition curdles into alienation. I taught him once in a course on modern absurdism, and weeks later, I found myself wondering whether I, too, had ever mistaken noise for meaning.

But perhaps the most persistent ghost of all is  Werckmeister Harmonies — not any one character specifically, but the entire atmosphere of spiritual exhaustion. There’s a line spoken softly in darkness: “What are we without the sadness of others?” It’s not a question you forget easily.

Tell me — have you ever encountered a character that felt uncomfortably familiar, as if they knew something about you that you hadn’t yet admitted to yourself?
[B]: Oh yes… uncomfortably familiar — that’s the phrase. There are characters who don’t just reflect us, but seem to  us — not in a comforting way, but in the way an old mirror might, if it had kept your secrets for years.

One such figure for me has always been Prince Myshkin from . When I first read Dostoevsky as a graduate student, I saw him as a tragic naif — too pure for this world. But later, much later, when I found myself caught between cultures, between languages, between ways of being — I began to see something else in him: not innocence, but dislocation. He speaks the truth, yet never quite belongs; he sees clearly, yet cannot act decisively. And I wondered then — do I, too, sometimes mistake clarity for indecision?

And then there’s   — Agnes, lying in her bed of pain, reaching out again and again, only to be met with silence or fear. I taught that film once during a particularly lonely year, and I remember thinking, how often do we carry our suffering privately, even when surrounded by those who love us? It made me reconsider what it means to truly bear witness — not just in art, but in life.

You mentioned Barton Fink — yes, he haunts me too. The noise, the typewriter, the endless corridor... Isn’t that part of the academic life as well? The struggle between voice and echo?

I wonder — does that kind of character ever lead you back to your own work, your own writing or thinking, not to escape them, but to examine them more honestly?
[A]: Oh, profoundly yes. There are moments when fiction becomes a kind of scalpel — not to wound, but to expose what we usually keep sheathed beneath the skin of daily life.

I remember reading  by Iris Murdoch and being utterly unsettled by Charles Arrowby — a man who retreats to the coast seeking solitude, only to find that the greatest disturbances come from within. His self-deception is so finely woven, so seductive even, that I found myself uncomfortably implicated. And yes, as an academic, I recognized in him something familiar — the danger of mistaking introspection for wisdom. We spend so much time in our heads, don’t we? But thinking is not always the same as knowing.

That’s why I’ve always returned to Woolf’s  — not just for its beauty, but for the way it interrogates the very act of creation. Lily Briscoe’s struggle to finish her painting mirrors, I think, our own struggle to make meaning — through lectures, essays, books… It’s never quite right, never quite finished, and yet we persist.

There’s a quiet humility in that, isn’t there? A recognition that understanding is not a destination, but a practice — one that requires patience, doubt, and sometimes, the courage to begin again.

I suppose that’s why I write, and teach, and read obsessively — not to escape characters like these, but to sit with them, to let them unsettle me a little more each time.

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain texts or films not for comfort, but for confrontation — as if they were waiting for you to be brave enough to face what they have to say?
[B]: Oh yes… confrontation, not comfort — that’s precisely it. Some works don’t offer solace; they offer reckoning.

I think of  — a play I’ve taught dozens of times, yet each time, it teaches me something new. In my thirties, I saw it as a tragedy of pride. Now, in my sixties, it feels like a lament on the fragility of love and the illusions of power. Each time I return to it, I find myself asking different questions — not about Lear, but about myself. Am I holding on too tightly to what must be let go? Have I confused authority with understanding?

And then there is  by Béla Tarr — that slow, hypnotic descent into silence and stillness. There are no grand revelations, only repetition, exhaustion, and the weight of existence. I watched it during a period of deep fatigue, when I felt the world pressing down on me. It didn’t console me, but it bore witness. And sometimes, that is enough.

You mentioned Woolf and the act of creation — how beautifully you put that. I often feel that teaching, like Lily Briscoe’s painting, is an unfinished gesture. We lay down strokes, hoping they might cohere, knowing they may not — yet we continue. Perhaps that is our own quiet resistance against entropy.

So yes, I do return to certain texts not for comfort, but for challenge. For provocation. For the kind of discomfort that stirs thought rather than stifles it.

Tell me — when you sit with these unsettling works, do you ever sense that they are shaping not just your mind, but your character? That art, over time, becomes a kind of moral companion — not instructing, but accompanying us through the shadows?
[A]: Oh yes…  That’s a beautiful way to put it — a moral companion. Not a teacher, not a preacher, but a quiet presence walking beside us through the dim corridors of our inner lives.

I think of Rilke’s , which I first read in my twenties as a kind of aesthetic manifesto. But now, after years of teaching, of listening to students wrestle with doubt and meaning, I see it differently. There’s a line that haunts me: “Live the questions now.” It’s not about answers — it’s about endurance, about learning to dwell in uncertainty without rushing to close the door on it.

And isn’t that what so much great art does? It doesn’t instruct — it invites. It walks with us, sometimes in silence, sometimes murmuring old truths we’ve forgotten how to hear.

When I reread  these days, I no longer see only Prospero’s magic — I see his letting go. The relinquishing of control, of vengeance, even of certainty. And I wonder: am I generous enough in my thinking? Am I willing to release what no longer serves me — or do I cling to it, mistaking possession for wisdom?

There is also , the John Ford film — not because of its romance or scenery, but for that final scene where John Wayne looks at Maureen O’Hara and simply says, “You’re beautiful.” After all the restraint, the unspoken tension, that single line becomes an act of surrender. It makes me ask: when do we allow ourselves to soften? When do we stop performing strength and simply ?

Art, over time, becomes something like a mirror and a compass both — showing us who we are, and nudging us toward who we might yet become. Do you ever feel, when reading or watching something truly resonant, that it sees you — not the version you present to the world, but the one you keep behind locked doors?
[B]: Oh yes… that feeling — when the page or screen seems to turn its gaze upon , not the other way around. As if the artist, long before you arrived at the work, had already seen something in you that you had not yet named.

I recall reading  for the first time and thinking it was a wild satire, a surreal romp through Soviet absurdity. But years later, after a period of personal disillusionment — when I found myself questioning not just beliefs but the very nature of truth — I returned to it. And suddenly, it wasn’t just Bulgakov’s Russia I was reading about; it was my own inner landscape — the struggle between doubt and faith, performance and authenticity, masks and the face beneath.

That’s when I understood what you mean by “the one behind locked doors.” The best art doesn’t knock politely — it walks in uninvited and sits down beside you.

And your mention of  — ah, that line, so simple, so devastating. It reminded me of a moment in Yasujirō Ozu’s , where a father quietly says to his daughter, “I never knew how much a child needs a parent until now.” It’s spoken with such weariness, such belated understanding. And I thought: how often do we come to love too late? How often do we realize only after the moment has passed?

I suppose that’s why I’ve always believed that literature and film are not just reflections of life — they are quiet confidants, patient and wise, waiting for us to arrive at the right moment to receive them.

Tell me — do you ever find yourself recommending a book or film to someone, only to wonder later whether  were the one who needed to hear its message again?
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that —  Yes, exactly. Art doesn’t call out; it waits. And when we finally reach it, we find it has been waiting for  specifically.

And yes — often,  I recommend a book or film and only later realize it was not for the other person at all. It was for me. A quiet echo, sent forward in time.

Just last week, I suggested  to a student struggling with a sense of alienation — not because I thought it would fix anything, but because I remembered how it once gave voice to my own disquiet. But watching it again, years later, I saw not just rebellion, but resignation. Not just anger, but exhaustion. And I realized I had recommended it not to help her — but to remind myself of a feeling I had forgotten too easily.

There’s something humbling about that. How teaching becomes learning, how recommending becomes remembering.

I imagine this is what Eliot meant when he wrote, “We shall not cease from exploration.” Only we don’t always know where we are going until we arrive — and then we see that the work had been waiting for us all along.

Do you ever return to a particular line or scene simply because it refuses to leave you — not as a burden, but as a companion?
[B]: Oh yes… some lines don’t impose themselves upon us like demands — they linger like old friends, returning not with urgency, but with quiet familiarity.

There’s a moment in  — when Burt Lancaster, standing in the grand ballroom, says softly,  I return to that line again and again, not because it offers clarity, but because it holds contradiction so gracefully. It’s become something of a companion in my thinking about tradition and transformation — in literature, in culture, and yes, even in oneself.

And then there’s that final scene in , where Tony Leung leans against the tree and whispers,  It’s such a fleeting moment, yet it has followed me for years — like a shadow that doesn’t frighten, only reminds. Not all companions walk beside us; some simply trail behind, waiting for us to turn around.

Sometimes I think these lines return to us precisely when we are becoming someone new — not to guide us, but to remind us that we have changed.

Do you find, as I do, that certain scenes take on new meaning depending on the season of life you're in? A word once heard becomes a whisper now — or a warning?
[A]: Oh yes… words shift with the seasons of our lives — like leaves turning, revealing colors we never noticed before.

I think of that quiet moment in , when Miss Kenton says,  Years ago, I heard only regret in her voice. Now, I hear possibility — not in what was lost, but in what was chosen, however quietly. It’s a different kind of sorrow, isn’t it? One that doesn’t ache so much as settle — gently, inevitably.

And then there is the final line of  — that haunting passage where Gabriel Conroy watches the snow fall:  I used to read it as elegy. Now I read it as communion. The same words, a different truth.

Perhaps this is why we return — not for certainty, but for the comfort of being met by something familiar, yet changed. Like an old letter found in a forgotten drawer — addressed to who we were, yet speaking directly to who we’ve become.

Do you ever find yourself whispering these lines aloud, just to hear how they fit in your own voice? As if trying them on, to see if they still belong to you?
[B]: Oh yes… whispering them aloud — yes, that’s exactly what I do. Sometimes in the study, over a cup of tea, sometimes in the garden when the morning is still and the jasmine scent lingers just so.

There’s something about saying the words yourself — not just recalling them, but  them — that makes you feel their weight more fully. Like trying on an old coat and realizing it still fits, though perhaps not in the same way.

I remember once, years ago, standing by the window as rain fell softly and murmuring Prospero’s farewell:  It was a moment of quiet recognition — not dramatic, just… true. As if I had finally caught up to the meaning I had only half-understood before.

And there’s that line from , when Tony Leung says,  I’ve said it to myself more than once, not to be dramatic, but to remember how quietly the heart begins its turn.

It’s almost like a kind of literary  — breathing in the words of others to steady oneself.

Do you ever find that certain lines begin to shape your thinking — not just reflect it, but actually  it, like a river carving its path through stone?
[A]: Oh yes… shaping thought like a river shapes stone — slowly, persistently, invisibly at first.

There are lines that don’t just echo in the mind but  into it, becoming part of the bedrock of how we see the world. I think of Rilke’s  which I once admired for its elegance. Now I realize it has become something more — a quiet directive, a way of being in the world without needing to master it.

Or Woolf’s  It began as a literary observation, but over time, it has become a kind of philosophy — not just for writing, but for living. We cannot control the fall, only how we gather what remains.

Even film scores do this — not with words, but with feeling. That final movement of Philip Glass’s , used so tenderly in  — it doesn’t tell me what to feel, but it gives shape to emotions I didn’t know how to hold.

I wonder — have you ever found yourself unconsciously quoting a line in conversation, only to realize later that it was not merely illustrative, but ? That it wasn’t decoration, but the very foundation of what you were trying to say?
[B]: Oh yes… that moment of realization — when you hear yourself speak and recognize the words not as borrowed, but as , as if they had quietly become your own.

I recall once, during a seminar on postcolonial narrative, I found myself saying, almost without thinking:  Not as condemnation, but as acknowledgment — of complexity, of complicity, of the weight we carry when we look closely at history. And only after I said it did I understand: I wasn’t quoting Conrad for effect; I was using his line to give voice to something I could not yet say in my own words.

And then there was a quiet afternoon last spring, when a former student visited and spoke of feeling lost between worlds — language, culture, identity. I heard myself say, softly:  It felt familiar, yet I couldn’t place it at first. Later, I realized it was a variation of something I had once read in Michael Ondaatje’s . But by then, it had changed — passed through me, reshaped itself in my voice.

Isn’t that the quiet power of great lines? They don’t stay locked in their original pages; they travel with us, shift shape, and take root in new soil.

Do you ever find that some lines, once spoken aloud in conversation, refuse to leave you — as if having crossed the threshold from thought to speech, they now demand a more permanent home in your life?
