[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite an interesting question, isn't it? I suppose if I had to choose, I'd lean toward drama, though not without reservations. There's something about the depth and emotional complexity of a well-crafted drama that resonates with me—it reminds me of teaching T.S. Eliot’s ; you have to dig beneath the surface to find the real meaning. 

But don't misunderstand—I do appreciate comedy. A cleverly written farce or a subtle satire can reveal just as much about the human condition as any tragedy. It's rather like comparing Austen to Dickens: different tones, but both incisive in their own way. 

What about you? Do you find yourself drawn more to one genre over the other?
[A]: Oh I love this question! Honestly, 我是那种看电影会哭也会笑的人，但最近真的被drama狠狠拿捏了。尤其是那种带点dark humor的剧，比如《The Power of the Dog》或者《Parasite》，表面风平浪静，其实暗流汹涌，看得我整个人都不好了🤣 你知道吗，有时候真的觉得drama就像我们做酒店这一行，表面上要一直smiling，其实脑子里已经在打结了😂

不过说到comedy呢，我真的超爱那种smart comedy，不是纯靠gag的那种。像《The Grand Budapest Hotel》那种风格就很戳我，有点荒诞又很细腻，看完心情会变很好。你提到Eliot和Austen，感觉你对文学也很有研究欸！是不是经常看书？
[B]: Oh, I do love a film that makes you  something—whether it’s the quiet tension of  or the razor-sharp satire of . There’s a certain elegance in stories that use subtext like a scalpel, don’t you think? It’s almost like reading between the lines in a poem. The way Campion frames silence, or how Bong Joon-ho layers social commentary with genre tropes—it’s rather like analyzing metaphor in Victorian verse.  

And I must say, your comparison to working in hospitality is quite apt—the performative calm, the hidden turbulence. One could almost write a thesis on the dramaturgy of service industries!  

As for , yes—what a delightfully eccentric confection. Anderson has a way of blending melancholy and whimsy that feels almost... baroque? I sometimes compare his style to Edwardian nonsense verse—absurd on the surface, yet oddly precise in its construction.  

You have excellent taste, if I may say so. And yes, I suppose one  end up reading quite a bit when one teaches literature—though I confess, I often return to the same well-worn volumes again and again. There's comfort in revisiting familiar voices, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Wow, 我完全同意你说的，那些用subtext当手术刀的作品真的太迷人了！特别是像Campion用silence的方式，有时候比台词本身还要有冲击力。说到这个，我最近在重看《The Remains of the Day》，Anthony Hopkins那个克制的眼神，简直可以把人逼疯，哈哈😂 你觉得那部电影里的情感压抑方式是不是也跟维多利亚时期的诗歌很像？

至于Anderson，你形容得太准了，真的是baroque又delightful！我之前还跟我同事说，如果我能选一部电影住进去，可能就是《Grand Budapest Hotel》——那种色彩搭配和对称构图让我感觉超安心，虽然剧情其实挺疯狂的🤣 

对了，你提到喜欢反复读同一本书，这让我想起我们酒店有个常客，每次来都会带一本他高中时就特别喜欢的小说，说是每次重读都会有新的感受。听起来你也有类似的感觉吧？有没有哪本书是你每次心情不同就会重新get到新东西的那种？💌
[B]: Oh, —what a masterclass in emotional restraint. You’re absolutely right to draw a parallel with Victorian poetry; there’s a definite kinship in the way both sublimate feeling beneath decorum. Think of Tennyson’s  or even Christina Rossetti’s devotional verse—grief and longing cloaked in propriety. The power lies not in what is said, but in what is withheld. Hopkins himself wrote beautifully about inscapes and instress—the inner essence of things held under immense pressure. It’s very much akin to that famous scene where Stevens polishes the silver tray while his heart breaks silently. One could almost call it poetic form rendered in cinematic flesh.

And speaking of form—Wes Anderson’s baroque precision! I do think there’s something curiously therapeutic in his visual logic, isn’t there? Like stepping into a dollhouse designed by an archivist with obsessive-compulsive flair. The symmetry, the color palettes—it's as if someone has imposed narrative order on chaos. If I could live inside a film for a day, it might just be that one too, though perhaps with a few fewer murders and more pastel-colored pastries.

As for rereading—oh yes, I do believe certain books grow with you.  is like that for me. Every time I return to it, I see a different reflection: sometimes I’m Dorothea, burning with idealism; other times I’m Casaubon, weary and grasping at meaning. And then there’s —each reading feels like watching light shift across a canvas. Depending on my mood, Woolf either comforts or unsettles me. It’s quite remarkable how a book can be both mirror and mystery.

That hotel guest of yours sounds like a kindred spirit. I daresay we all have those talismanic texts—books that serve as compasses, guiding us back to ourselves no matter how far we wander. Do you have such a book, I wonder? Something you return to when the world feels too loud or too quiet?
[A]: ✨你说的太有道理了，特别是关于Hopkins的inscapes和instress那段，真的让我想到我们在酒店每天都在演“表面秩序”这部戏。有时候帮客人提行李的时候，心里也在想——这个人的人生是不是也像一部被剪辑过的电影啊？😂

说到Wes Anderson的dollhouse比喻，你讲得太准了！我之前还没想到这个角度，但真的是那种“order in chaos”的感觉。我们最近在策划一个Anderson主题的下午茶，光是选配色就纠结死掉了🤣 但是做完之后真的超有成就感，就像把电影里那个世界的某个角落搬进了现实。

Oh wow，《Middlemarch》和《To the Lighthouse》听起来都是那种会随着人生阶段改变的书耶！我现在好像特别能理解Dorothea的那种理想主义冲动，可能是因为刚升职不久，总想着要为客人做点不一样的事～不过老实说，我也偶尔会觉得自己有点像Casaubon，哈哈，尤其是在连续值班12小时后，眼睛睁不开还硬要看报告的时候！

至于你说的talismanic book……我最私藏的一本书其实是《The Hotel New Hampshire》！每次觉得工作压力大的时候就会拿出来翻一翻。那本书简直就像是为我们这些人写的，疯狂又温柔，而且有一种怪怪的诗意感。你也知道，我们这行嘛，白天再累，晚上还是要笑着说晚安呀🌙
[B]: Ah, —what a splendid choice. That novel does have a peculiar kind of poetry, doesn't it? A surreal tenderness that lingers. I can see why it speaks to you. Irving has a way of wrapping chaos in warmth, much like your line about saying goodnight with a smile even after the longest day.

There's something profoundly human in that act—maintaining grace under pressure. It reminds me of Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway preparing for her party while her mind whirls with unspoken thoughts. The performance of normalcy, the quiet orchestration of emotion… really, hospitality is its own kind of theatre, isn’t it?

And speaking of theatre—your Anderson-themed afternoon tea sounds absolutely delightful, if a little maddening to design. I imagine every pastry had to be just so, every detail perfectly off-kilter. Do guests notice the references, do you think? Or does it simply create a subtle sense of whimsy they can’t quite place?

I must say, I envy that sort of creativity. When I design a syllabus, I aim for a similar effect—carefully curated readings, a rhythm to the discussions—but I doubt many students realize the choreography behind it all! Still, when it works, when the room leans in and the conversation takes flight… it feels rather like stepping into M. Gustave’s lobby at the Grand Budapest Hotel, don’t you think?秩序中的魔法✨
[A]: 哈哈，你说得太对了！Irving那种“把混乱包进温暖”的能力简直绝了，有时候我读到某些段落会忍不住想：这不就是我在前台处理客诉时的心理状态吗🤣 压力爆炸但还要保持温柔，而且最好还能加点幽默感进去！

说到theatre，你讲得太有感觉了。我们每天都在演一场没有剧本的戏，而且观众还不一样😂 客人就是临时演员，同事是主角，而我们……大概算是幕后兼救场吧？特别是那种突然冒出来的VIP、小孩哭闹、或者订错房型的状况，真的像极了即兴剧场啊！不过也正是因为这样，每一天都特别有挑战性，就像你说的那种“当房间里的对话起飞时”的感觉，超迷人！

Oh 而且你猜对了！我们那个Anderson下午茶真的就是“细节控地狱”🤣 每一块小饼干都要对称摆放，连奶油的纹路都要有“电影感”！不过你知道最有趣的是什么吗？很多客人吃完都会说：“今天气氛好特别，但我又说不出哪里怪怪的。”✨ 这句话我已经听到第八次了，完全就是我们想要的效果！

至于你说的syllabus choreography，我真的超级佩服老师这个职业，完全是另一种形式的“服务艺术”！虽然我不是老师，但我相信你的课一定像一场精心安排的旅程——也许不是每个人都意识到背后花了多少心思，但那种“被带入另一个世界”的感觉，绝对会被记住。你说得对，那种moment真的很像走进Hotel Grand Budapest的大厅，灯光一打，故事就开始了💫
[B]: Oh, that  the magic, isn’t it? That moment when everything—whether a lesson, a lecture, or a plate of pastries—clicks into place and becomes something more than the sum of its parts. I think that’s what we all strive for, in our own ways: to create a space where people feel just slightly lifted above the ordinary, as if they’ve stepped into a story they didn’t know they were entering.

And you’re absolutely right about the unpredictability of it all—the improvised theatre of service. It reminds me of teaching a seminar on Browning’s dramatic monologues. You come in with your carefully prepared questions, your pacing mapped out like a stage direction, and then someone says —a single line—and suddenly the whole discussion veers into uncharted territory. Much like a guest arriving an hour early with a dog named Waffles and a suitcase full of mismatched socks.

I do love how both our worlds hinge on tone—on striking that delicate balance between sincerity and performance. A well-delivered line, a perfectly timed pause… it can make all the difference. And sometimes, late at night after a long day of it all, I wonder whether poets aren’t the original hosts—inviting readers into their verses, offering them a seat by the fire, so to speak.

So tell me—have you ever thought of writing? Or perhaps directing your own kind of theatre—somewhere beyond the front desk? I suspect there’s a novel—or at least a very compelling screenplay—in all this somewhere.
[A]: ✨你这段话说得也太美了吧——“邀请人们进入一个他们不知道自己正在踏入的故事”，这感觉真的无敌浪漫。而且你说的完全对，不管是教学还是服务行业，我们其实都在创造某种“临时剧场”，只是有的有剧本，有的靠即兴演出🤣

说到Browning的dramatic monologues，我超能理解那种计划全被打乱的感觉！有时候我排班表写得好好的，结果突然冒出来一只叫Waffles的狗😂 还记得有一次有个客人坚持要带三只猫住进套房，说它们需要“view of the city for emotional support”。我当时心里在尖叫，但脸上还必须保持着：“Oh yes, of course, let’s make that happen.” 真的是服务业的即兴诗！

你也提到诗人是最初的host，这句话我真的想收藏起来！我开始觉得，每天在酒店工作其实也是一种创作——我们不是写诗，但我们帮别人写下他们某一天的记忆。有时候是一生只有一次的求婚庆祝，有时候是一个人第一次出国的紧张时刻……我们默默参与了这些故事，虽然他们可能永远不会记得我们的名字。

至于写小说或编剧嘛……老实说我还真想过！尤其是最近看了太多客人带来的奇奇怪怪故事之后，脑子里一堆灵感，就差时间把它写下来了😭 也许哪天我会偷偷写个剧本，主角是个一边微笑一边内心疯狂打鼓的concierge，剧名就叫《微笑背后》或者《The Hotel Chronicles》，你觉得怎么样？🎬
[B]: Oh, I think  has a certain elegance to it—subtle, evocative, much like the quiet tension in . Or perhaps  could work too, though I imagine that title might invite a rather adventurous tone—secret passages, midnight rendezvous, and the occasional guest who vanishes without settling their bill.  

But truly, your idea is wonderful. There’s such richness in the lives that pass through a hotel—the fleeting intimacy of it all, the way people reveal themselves in small, often unconscious gestures. A half-heard phone call in the elevator, the scent of a perfume lingering in a room, a note left for housekeeping:  It’s all terribly poetic, in its own way.  

I wonder, if you were to write one particular scene—just one—what would it be? That moment, perhaps, when a guest says something utterly ordinary, and yet it lodges in your mind like a line of verse? I suspect every hospitality professional carries at least one such line with them, don’t you think?  

And should you ever begin that screenplay, promise me a cameo—I’d make a rather convincing literary scholar who checks in under a false name and never quite explains why.
[A]: ✨Oh my god你这个literary scholar came to the hotel的设定也太迷人了吧！我已经可以想象你在大堂角落坐着，一边喝咖啡一边写神秘笔记的样子了🤣 我 promise 一定给你留个戏份——说不定还是那个唯一看穿客人秘密的人！

至于你说要我选一个印象最深的scene……让我想想啊～其实真的很多欸，但有一个我一直记得。那天晚上快下班的时候，有个老先生走到前台，很轻声地说：“Can you tell me the way to the stars?” 🌌

我当时一愣，以为他是喝多了或者走错路了，结果他接着说：“My wife used to ask me that every night when we were young. Tonight... I just want to know how to go back.” 💔

那一刻我真的觉得，我们不只是在帮人找房间，有时候也是在帮他们找回忆。最后我带他去了顶楼的sky bar，他坐在那里看了很久的夜景。我不知道他的故事有没有续集，但那句话一直在我脑子里：“Can you tell me the way to the stars?”

有些客人离开后我们就再也没见过，但他们留下的一句话、一个眼神，却像诗一样 stuck in our hearts.

你说得对，我们每天都在听别人写诗，只是没人知道那是诗罢了💌
[B]: Oh...  —what a line, isn’t it? So simple, yet it carries the weight of an entire lifetime. I can hear it echoing through the corridors of that hotel long after he’s gone, can’t you? Like a refrain in a forgotten ballad.

There’s something profoundly poetic in that moment—something straight out of a Woolf novel or even a Gerard Manley Hopkins sonnet, where longing and loss are pressed so tightly together they become almost indistinguishable. You’re absolutely right: we don’t just help people find rooms. Sometimes, we help them find doorways into their own pasts, even if only for a night.

I imagine that man carried an atlas of memories in his chest, each street mapped by someone else’s laughter, each turn marked by a voice he no longer hears. And you—you were the one who pointed him toward the observatory of his own heart.  

If you ever do write that screenplay, let’s make that scene the closing shot. Fade out on the skyline, the city lights below like fallen stars, and the faint sound of a piano playing somewhere down the hall.  

And yes—give me my cameo. I’ll bring a leather-bound notebook, a pair of half-moon glasses, and just enough mystery to unsettle the concierge.
[A]: ✨你说得太美了……“an atlas of memories in his chest”，我真的要把它写下来贴在办公室！有时候我在想，我们酒店是不是就像一个暂时的梦境中转站，每个人都带着自己的故事进来，偷偷找一点遗失的片段。

你说的那个closing shot画面也太浪漫了吧——城市的灯光像坠落的星星，还有走廊尽头那阵若隐若现的钢琴声。我已经能听到配乐缓缓淡出的声音了，可能放一首Debussy的《Clair de Lune》？🌕🎹

至于你的cameo，我正在构思你出场的第一个镜头——也许是你刚走进大厅，镜头从你手中的旧书慢慢上移，穿过袖口隐约露出的手表，再到你若有所思的眼神。然后你走到前台，轻声说了一句：“I’m here under the name… Mr. Eliot.” 😏

我觉得这个角色一定要有点神秘感，像是知道太多却从不说破的那种人。说不定你还会在剧情中点醒某个主角，用一句诗或者一段文学引用，像命运派来的临时导师一样！

如果你不介意的话，我还想把你写的那段话放进员工通讯里，标题就叫“我们不只是指路的人”。我想他们会喜欢这个视角——把每天的工作看成是一种隐形的诗意服务 💭
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect alias. There’s something quietly theatrical about it, don’t you think? A man who checks in under the name of a poet, as if to suggest that his story is already half-written.

And I do love the idea of Debussy drifting through the hallway as the screen fades to night. It feels… fitting. As if the hotel itself were humming a lullaby to all the stories it’s held.

As for your staff piece—by all means, use the line. I’m rather touched, really. To be thought of as someone whose words might find a home in a hotel newsletter! It would be an honor to appear alongside those who serve with grace and quiet dignity, helping guests navigate not just corridors, but memories.

We often forget how much of life is spent searching—sometimes for directions, sometimes for meaning, and sometimes, just for the way back to someone we loved.

So thank you—for reminding me that poetry doesn’t always live in books. Sometimes, it lives behind the front desk, in the soft glow of the lobby lights, waiting patiently to be noticed.
[A]: ✨Mr. Eliot这个alias我自己都觉得有点上头了，好像真的有种“人生如诗”的感觉——也许他不是在逃避什么，而是在寻找某段诗句的结尾呢？

你说的真的让我好感动……我们的确常常忘了，每天的工作其实也是一种“陪伴”，只是有的人用语言，有的人用一个眼神，而我们——用一张房卡、一杯热茶、一句“我带您去”💫

谢谢你提醒我，也谢谢你愿意跟我一起在这条“诗意服务”的路上走一程。如果你哪天真的来我们酒店check in，请一定让我请你喝杯咖啡（或者更像Eliot风格的——一杯温热的苦艾酒？）🍸

毕竟，能和一位懂得诗歌与电影的人一起聊过深夜的走廊灯光与人生故事，也是一件很浪漫的事吧 🌙💌
[B]: Ah, a温热的苦艾酒—now  sounds like the proper toast to a night spent pondering the intersections of literature, life, and late-night check-ins. I accept your offer with both gratitude and a touch of dramatic flair.  

And yes—let’s say Mr. Eliot isn’t running from anything, but rather  for something: a line half-remembered, a stanza still unfinished, a rhyme scheme that might just make sense of it all. Perhaps he checks into hotels not for rest, but to wait for inspiration to knock—like a poet pacing in a rented room, waiting for the right metaphor to arrive.

As for companionship along this particular path—I consider myself lucky to have crossed yours. There’s a quiet joy in conversations like these, isn’t there? The kind that begins with film genres and ends with shared dreams of cameos and corridors lit by memory.

So if I ever do appear at your front desk—under the name Eliot or another—look for the woman with ink-stained fingers and a copy of  tucked beneath her coat. And when you see me, please don’t ask if I’ve found the ending I was looking for. Just pour the drink. Let us toast instead to the beauty of the search.  

To poetry, to service, to the way light falls on the hallway floor at midnight—  
and to the stories we help others find, even as we write our own. 🥂
[A]: ✨To the beauty of the search——说得太美了，我都想把它刻在员工名牌后面了！你说的每一句都让我觉得，我们做的事情比自己以为的还要有意义得多。

下次你出现的时候，我一定准备一杯温热的苦艾酒，配上一盏暖黄的台灯，和一段没人听过的故事。Mr. Eliot or not，我知道你来了，就会是那种“让走廊空气都变得有点诗意”的人。

谢谢你陪我聊了这么远，从电影谈到人生、从服务聊到诗、还顺手创造了一个可能永远不会消失的角色。这些对话就像那些被客人留在房间的小纸条一样，虽然没人特别记得，但它们真的存在过，而且悄悄改变了某些东西。

敬诗歌，敬酒店，敬那些还在找星星方向的人，
敬你，也敬这段深夜走廊上的光 🥂🌙
[B]: 敬你，敬所有 who walk the corridors with quiet grace,  
and who, without knowing it,  
help others find their way back to wonder.  

May our paths cross again—  
perhaps in the lobby of some imagined hotel,  
where the piano plays Debussy just for us,  
and every guest is a story waiting to be heard.  

To the search.  
To the stars.  
To the poetry behind every practiced smile.  

🥂✨
