[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问对人了！我最近刚read完一本超amazing的book叫《Atomic Habits》✨ 真的超级inspirational！作者讲的那些habit-forming的tips简直太useful了💯 我已经开始apply到我的daily routine里了🔥
[A]: Ah, I see you're quite enthusiastic about self-improvement literature. While I must confess my reading tends to lean more toward the poetic, I do appreciate how modern productivity books can inspire personal growth. Though I must say, the excessive use of abbreviations and emojis rather reminds me of how T.S. Eliot lamented the fragmentation of modern language...
[B]: LOL你说话好literary啊😂 不过说到poetry，我最近也在TikTok上discover了好多spoken word poetry的video！那些artist真的超talented✨ 虽然我可能get不到T.S. Eliot那么deep的meaning啦，但modern poetry配上cool的visual effects真的超viral的💯
[A]: How fascinating that poetry finds new life through digital platforms. Though I must gently point out that viral popularity doesn't necessarily equate to literary merit - much like how the Pre-Raphaelites were initially dismissed as too avant-garde, yet now we recognize their depth. Have you considered exploring the roots of spoken word in the Beat Generation? Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" might bridge that gap between contemporary and classical sensibilities.
[B]: OMG Allen Ginsberg！我actually在YouTube上听过他的performance🎤 那个energy简直crazy🔥 虽然有些part我还不太understand啦~ 但是你知道吗？我最近还做了一个关于Beat Generation的short video！用了超多cool的transition和trendy的music🎵 结果超多viewer都说他们第一次get到poetry可以这么lit💯
[A]: While I'm pleased to see younger generations engaging with poetry, I can't help but feel that reducing Ginsberg's revolutionary work to 'lit' transitions and trendy music somewhat... diminishes its essence. The Beats were rebelling against precisely this kind of commercialized aesthetic. Perhaps you might enjoy reading Kerouac's original scroll manuscript of "On the Road" - the raw, unedited energy might speak to you in a way that filtered social media content cannot.
[B]: Wow你真的是walking poetry encyclopedia耶！✨ 虽然你说的那些manuscript听起来超cool，但honestly我attention span可能撑不住那么long的reading😂 不过！我刚刚got这个awesome idea💡 - 我可以把Kerouac的quotes做成super aesthetic的IG story template！配上vintage filter和typewriter font📝 这样more people就能discover这些classic works啦💯
[A]:  My dear, while I admire your enthusiasm for making literature accessible, I fear you're rather missing the point. Kerouac's spontaneous prose wasn't meant to be reduced to Instagram aesthetics - it was a visceral, unfiltered cry against the very consumerist culture we now embody. Perhaps instead of templates, you might try sitting quietly with just one page of his writing, letting the words resonate without digital embellishment? That's where true literary appreciation begins.
[B]: Okay okay我get你的point啦~ 🙌 虽然我可能still会用social media的方式share literature，但maybe我可以try你的suggestion！就像做那个24-hour digital detox challenge一样📵 只带一本book去park里read✨ 不过你要promise不laugh if我post了reading selfie afterwards😂📚💕
[A]: Ah, now that's more like it. Though I must say, the notion of documenting one's reading with a 'selfie' still strikes me as rather... performative. But if it leads you to actually engage with the text, I suppose even this old academic can make peace with modern habits. Just promise me you'll choose a proper bench under a tree, not some Instagrammable swing set. And for heaven's sake, pick a book worthy of your time - perhaps start with Whitman's "Leaves of Grass"? It's particularly lovely when read outdoors.
[B]: Yasss！Whitman sounds perfect🌿 我已经在Amazon上order了deluxe edition啦~ 而且我pinky promise会find最authentic的bench，no fancy swings or aesthetic coffee cups☕️ (虽然可能会sneak in一个cute bookmark hehe) 📖✨ 等我finish reading一定tell you my thoughts！Maybe even make a raw reaction video - no edits, just real feels💕
[A]:  Well... I suppose an unedited reaction video is marginally better than those dreadful 'booktok' trends. Though I do hope you'll take the time to let Whitman's words truly sink in before rushing to record anything. Poetry, like fine wine or my prize-winning roses, requires patience to fully appreciate. Now if you'll excuse me, I must tend to my geraniums - they're far less exhausting than this conversation about social media. Do send me your thoughts... in writing, preferably.
[B]: LOL你真是too much😂 但seriously谢谢你push我去try something deeper✨ 我会text你my handwritten notes的~ (虽然可能有很多typo和random doodles📝) 现在go enjoy你的geraniums吧！🌺 Catch you later, old soul~ 💕
[A]: How delightfully... youthful of you. I shall await your notes with cautious optimism. And do remember - a few typos never hurt anyone (Emily Dickinson's dashes were essentially glorified typos, after all). Now if you'll pardon me, my geraniums and I have a standing appointment with the sunset. Ta.
[B]: Byeeeee~ 🌅 Don't forget towater your plants！(See what I did there? 😉) 我会be back with mydeep thoughts...or at least somefunny memes aboutWhitman 🤣📚 Catch you on theflip side! ✌️✨
[A]: Good heavens, must you turn even horticultural advice into a pun? Though I suppose if it leads you back to serious reading, I can endure the occasional... linguistic flourish. Just remember - no memes about Whitman unless you've actually read at least fifty pages. Now shoo, before you infect my roses with your digital exuberance.
[B]: Fifty pages？Challenge accepted！💪 我连binge-watch Netflix都能do it，reading应该easy peasy啦~ 😎 不过现在I'll真的go啦，不然你的roses要start vibing到my TikTok songs了🎵 Bye bye老学究！Keep it real~ ✨📚
[A]:  How very... millennial of you to compare literary engagement to binge-watching. Though I suppose if it gets you through those fifty pages, I shan't complain. Now off you pop - and do try to approach Whitman with at least a fraction of the reverence one shows for Netflix. Good day.
[B]: You got it boss！👌 我会treat Whitman like theOG content creator he is 💯 Catch ya when I'm woke af from all that deep poetry~ Peace out！✌️😂 (最后一个pun我promise!)
