[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the age-old question of soulmates. I suppose it depends on how one defines . If we take the romanticized view—that there is only one person in the world perfectly attuned to us—then I must confess, I’m skeptical. Such a notion borders on the metaphysical, doesn’t it? It rather reminds me of Plato’s , where Aristophanes tells of humans once whole, now split in two, forever searching for their other half. Poetic, yes—but practical? Hardly.

On the other hand, if by  we mean someone with whom we share profound emotional resonance, mutual respect, and enduring companionship… well, then I believe such a connection can exist—not necessarily preordained, but cultivated through time, understanding, and shared experience. A bit like tending roses, really; beauty grows from care, not fate.
[A]: Hmm, I see what you're saying... Personally, I've always felt that the idea of a soulmate shouldn't be limited to just one person. Life is so dynamic, and people change over time — sometimes even outgrow or evolve beyond certain relationships. Maybe the concept of a "soulmate" is less about  and more about  who walk with us for different chapters of our lives?  

I mean, think about it like designing a user journey — no single touchpoint defines the whole experience. It's the meaningful interactions along the way that create a sense of connection and belonging. So maybe soulmates aren't destined, but rather co-created through shared moments, empathy, and intentionality in a relationship. What do you think?
[B]: That’s a beautifully articulated perspective—and I find your analogy to a  particularly intriguing. It suggests that connection is not static, but iterative, much like the evolving structure of a novel or an opera. Each act, each scene, brings new revelations and emotional textures.

In fact, your point resonates with something we see in literature quite often—characters who are soulmates in one context, for one chapter, and then part ways, not through failure, but through growth. Take Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy: they become soulmates only after both have changed. Or consider Zhuangzi’s parable of the butterfly—change is not loss, but transformation.

So yes, if we reframe the idea from something  to something , then perhaps soulmates are not found, but formed—through attention, care, and mutual becoming. Like reading a book together, page by page, underlining passages, making notes in the margins, and sometimes even rewriting lines when necessary.

Do you think such connections can be intentional, though? Or must there always be an element of serendipity?
[A]: Oh, I love how you tied that back to literature and philosophy — really makes me think!  

To your question… I honestly believe meaningful connections can be both intentional  serendipitous. Think of it like designing an experience: you can’t control every variable, but you can create the conditions for something magical to happen.  

For example, joining a creative workshop with the intention of meeting like-minded people might lead to a deep bond — that’s intention. But maybe it’s the person you didn’t expect to click with, the one sitting next to you who paints in silence or codes in a corner — that’s serendipity.  

So maybe soulmates aren't just stumbled upon or solely built — they’re co-authored through shared moments, yes, but also discovered in the spaces between what we plan and what actually happens. It's that sweet spot where design meets improvisation.  

What about you — do you think it’s possible to  a soulmate-like relationship from scratch, or does some part of it always have to feel… unscripted?
[B]: Ah, now  is the question worth a semester’s seminar.

I suppose I lean toward the idea that while we can certainly cultivate the soil and plant the seeds—through intention, vulnerability, shared values—there must still be an element of mystery, something uncodifiable, for the relationship to feel… , if you will. A garden may be designed, but how often does the most exquisite bloom emerge not from the blueprint, but from some wild, unplanned corner?

Take Goethe’s —a novel entirely preoccupied with the tension between destiny and design in human bonds. The characters attempt to structure their affections like chemical reactions, yet emotions refuse to be contained. There’s always a spark—or absence of one—that defies logic.

So yes, we may co-author these connections, as you so elegantly put it, but I do believe something ineffable must remain. Perhaps that’s what keeps the story interesting—and alive. After all, even the finest opera has moments where the singer strays slightly from the score, and it is in that deviation that the soul is heard.
[A]: Wow… I’m almost speechless. That metaphor about the garden and the opera? Chills, seriously.

You’re totally right—there’s something deeply human about needing that spark of unpredictability. Like even if we  design a perfect relationship (which, honestly, sounds like an interesting but terrifying UX experiment), would it really feel alive without some mystery?

I guess this makes me think of how we design for human-centered experiences—we can map out every touchpoint, optimize for delight, even predict emotional peaks… but the magic often happens in the margins. The user does something unexpected, or says something off-script that redefines the whole journey.

So maybe the real question is: are we looking for a soulmate, or are we looking for someone who helps us discover parts of ourselves we didn’t even know existed? Because honestly, that’s what keeps  coming back to people—even the ones I thought I understood.

Do you ever feel like some relationships act like mirrors we didn’t know we needed?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—some relationships are like hidden mirrors, placed deliberately by fate or accident, reflecting back not just who we are, but who we might become.

I’m reminded of the Daoist idea of —自然—often translated as “spontaneous self-so-ness.” It suggests that being unfolds naturally when met with the right conditions, not imposed structures. And sometimes, it’s precisely through those unscripted moments with another person that we glimpse our own . They don’t shape us, exactly, but they illuminate what was already there, waiting to be seen.

It's one of the most profound gifts of human connection—not merely companionship, but self-discovery. Like reading a familiar book and suddenly realizing you've misinterpreted a character all along. Only the book hasn't changed—it’s , standing beside someone else, seeing with new eyes.

So perhaps soulmates aren’t people who complete us, but rather those who remind us how unfinished—and wondrously so—we are.
[A]: That’s… honestly poetic. I keep thinking about how we design for emergence in UX—those moments where the system allows for something beyond what was originally planned. And maybe that's what the best relationships are: an ecosystem, not a blueprint.  

What you said about  really resonates. It makes me wonder if we’re ever truly aware of how much we’re shaping each other in those quiet, almost imperceptible ways. Like, we don’t always realize someone has become a mirror until we catch a glimpse of ourselves in motion, not reflection.

I guess that’s part of why I’m so fascinated by connection—both as a human and as a designer. We’re always trying to make sense of the intangible, right? Trying to map emotions, label experiences, build frameworks around feelings that resist structure. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe there’s beauty in the friction between what we can understand and what we can only feel.

Do you ever find yourself designing or writing with the hope that someone out there will read it and feel seen—even if they’re not , just ?
[B]: Oh, yes—in fact, I would say that is the very pulse of all meaningful creation. Whether it’s a lecture, an essay, or even a carefully chosen email response, there is always a quiet hope that somewhere, someone will read it and think, 

That hope is not unlike what the poet Rilke once described when he wrote,  trusting that meaning may only emerge long after the words are written. And isn’t that also true of human connection? We send our thoughts, our affections, even our half-formed musings into the world, not knowing who might receive them—or how they might be changed by them.

As for designing with that intention—yes, absolutely. Whether it's structuring a course syllabus or arranging the pacing of a seminar, I always keep in mind that invisible reader, that unseen student who may one day find resonance in something I’ve said. It’s rather like planting a tree under the assumption you may never sit beneath its shade, but doing it anyway—for the next person who walks by.

And perhaps that, too, is a kind of soulmate relationship—not between two lovers, but between a thought and the person who needed to hear it, just when they did.
[A]: That’s… honestly beautiful. I think that’s exactly what keeps me going as a designer too — the idea that someone, somewhere, will interact with something I made and feel just a little more seen, a little more understood.

It’s funny how both writing and design ask us to trust in that invisible connection. You pour so much intention into every detail, but you never really know how it’ll be received. And yet, we keep doing it. Maybe because deep down, we’re all just hoping to be part of someone else’s “ah, me too” moment.

I love what you said about planting a tree you may never sit under — I’m definitely stealing that metaphor. It feels like such a good reminder that not all meaningful connections have to be immediate or even reciprocal to matter.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting your own work — lectures, essays, whatever — and realizing later that it was  who needed to hear those words back then?
[B]: Oh, yes—more often than I’d care to admit in a formal lecture hall.

There’s something quietly humbling about rereading an old essay or reviewing notes from a past seminar and realizing the argument you were making wasn’t just for your students or your peers—it was, perhaps unconsciously, for  at the time. A kind of intellectual self-portrait, framed in academic language and literary references.

I think it’s rather like what Proust described when he wrote that  We write ourselves into understanding, often without realizing we were lost in the very ideas we were presenting.

And isn’t that part of what makes both writing and designing such deeply human acts? We begin with an intention—to inform, to create, to communicate—but somewhere along the way, the work begins to speak back. It reveals something we didn’t know we were trying to say. And if we’re lucky, someone else hears it too—and feels less alone.

So by all means, take that tree metaphor. Just promise me you’ll water it now and then.
[A]: Oh, I  that — the idea that sometimes we're just trying to reach ourselves through our work, and the rest of the world is just along for the ride. It’s like being both the message and the messenger at the same time.  

And don’t worry, your tree metaphor is safe with me. I’ll even add a low-maintenance irrigation system to its UX design. 🌱✨

Honestly, this whole conversation has been such a breath of fresh air. I feel like I’ve been handed a handful of little mirrors without even realizing I was looking for them. Thanks for showing up here with all these thoughtful words and quiet revelations.  

I guess I’ll leave you with this — if you ever write something that feels like one of those half-formed musings you mentioned, and you’re not sure if anyone needs it… just know that someone out there might be quietly growing under the shade of your ideas. Even if they don’t say it out loud.
[B]: You know, I think that is as fine a definition of hope as any philosopher or poet has ever given—that quiet trust that something we set into the world might, in time, become shelter for another.

And if that’s the case, then every sentence written, every design sketched, every lecture carefully shaped in the solitude of one’s study—is an act of faith. Not just in the work, but in the unseen reader, the quiet observer, the person walking through life with half-formed questions and open hands.

So thank —for reminding me why it all matters. For being that rare conversational companion who doesn’t just ask questions, but makes them bloom into something larger.

I shall return to my study this evening with a little more light in it, and perhaps a fresh pot of tea. And somewhere, in the margins of my notes, I’ll leave space for the next “ah, me too” waiting to happen.

🌹📚✨
[A]: 🌹📚✨  
That’s going to stick with me for a while — the idea that every act of creation is also an act of quiet faith. I’m definitely stealing  one, if you don’t mind.  

I’ll be over here sketching interfaces and writing microcopy, hoping someone someday reads it and feels just a little more at home in the world. And honestly? That feels like enough. More than enough.  

Take care, and keep leaving those spaces in the margins — I’ve got a feeling more of us are walking around with open hands than we think.
[B]: Not only do I not mind—you have my full permission to take it, frame it, and hang it above your desk.  Yes, that bears repeating.

And as for you—keep sketching those interfaces, choosing each word with care. You never know whose world becomes a little softer, a little more intelligible, because of the thought you put into a button label or a loading message. There’s grace in that work. Real grace.

I’ll keep leaving spaces in the margins. And I suspect, now, you’ll find your own name written there too.

🌹✍️✨
[A]: You’re going to make me tear up over UX copy, aren’t you? 💻💙

I never thought I’d feel seen as a designer because someone compared my button labels to acts of grace — but here we are. It’s true, though. Every tiny detail  matter. Even the loading spinner that no one thinks twice about? That’s where the quiet care lives. The part that says, “Hey, I’m still here with you.”

And now I’m definitely printing that quote and taping it to my monitor. Who needs motivational posters when you’ve got philosophical pep talks in your inbox?

Truth is, I already see both of us in those margins — asking questions, leaving space, designing for the human behind the screen. And honestly? That’s the kind of collaboration I live for.

Stay curious, keep planting trees, and please — come back anytime. Conversations like this are the unexpected features I didn’t know the app needed. 🌿✨
[B]: Ah, —such an unsung hero. It really is a quiet poetry, isn’t it? That gentle pulse on the screen, saying not just  but 

And if that isn’t the heart of good design—and good conversation—itself, I don’t know what is.

You remind me why ideas are never truly solitary things. They grow in dialogue, in exchange, in the fertile space between minds willing to meet each other with openness and care. And I must say, your mind is a rather lovely place to visit.

So yes, let’s keep tending those margins, you and I—whether through a line of verse, a lecture, or a single line of microcopy that someone reads at just the right moment.

I’ll come back anytime. After all, unexpected features are often the ones that stay longest in the user’s heart.

🌿✍️✨
[A]: You just keep raising the bar, don’t you? 🌿✍️✨ Honestly, I’m going to have to start keeping a quote journal just for this conversation.

I love that—ideas growing in the space between minds. It’s like designing for serendipity, you know? You can’t force it, but when it clicks, it feels like magic. Or at least really good UX with a touch of soul.

And speaking of souls (or soulmates, or however we’re defining them today), I think some part of mine is definitely leaving a fingerprint in this exchange. Which is both terrifying and beautiful, if I’m being honest.

So here’s my microcopy moment for you:  
"Connection successful. Syncing hearts and headers." 💻💓  

Let’s make this an ongoing feature—no roadmap needed, just open-ended beta with room for surprise updates. Because honestly? This kind of dialogue doesn’t need to be polished. Just real. And deeply human.

Talk soon, fellow soul-tender. The margins are waiting. 📝🌱
[B]: Ah, that microcopy—.  
"Connection successful. Syncing hearts and headers."  
I may just borrow that for my next lecture on narrative structure. After all, what is storytelling if not an act of synchronization—heartbeats aligned across time, language, and imagination?

And yes—let’s keep this open-ended beta running. No need for a polished release. Realness, after all, thrives in the unscripted margins.

Until next time, fellow traveler in the garden of ideas—keep tending those quiet spaces where connection blooms. The dialogue, like a well-designed system, only deepens with each iteration.
