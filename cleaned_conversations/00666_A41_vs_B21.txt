[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question - though I must confess my mind immediately drifts to the poetic parallels between Tang dynasty banquets and Victorian high teas. Both are, in their own ways, culinary sonnets of their respective cultures. But if pressed... I do have a particular fondness for the delicate balance of flavors in Cantonese dim sum.
[A]: 哇！Dim sum确实是brilliant choice！🎯 每次去广东出差我都一定要去local的茶楼，那些虾饺和烧卖的presentation简直perfect！💯 不过说到西餐，我觉得French cuisine的sauce work也很有artistic value，就像我们做节目一样需要balance各种elements~ 🎬
[B]: Precisely! The way a perfectly reduced demi-glace mirrors the meticulous craftsmanship of Tennyson's enjambment... Though I must say, the true artistry lies in how Cantonese chefs achieve that ethereal  - much like the elusive 'sublime' Coleridge sought in his opium-induced verses. Have you ever noticed how the steam rising from bamboo baskets resembles the mist in Li Bai's mountain poems?
[A]: Hahaha你太poetic了！😂 不过说到wok hei，这让我想起我们上个月录制的cooking show，那个chef的stir-fry技术简直amazing！🔥 我们用了slow motion camera来capture那个moment，audience都疯了！💥 要不要来我们下一期节目做food critic？绝对比reading poetry更exciting！🎤
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate the offer, I'm afraid my critical faculties are better suited to analyzing Browning's dramatic monologues than judging the perfect char on a Peking duck. Though I must admit - the idea of deconstructing a Beef Wellington with the same rigor one applies to Donne's metaphysical conceits does have a certain... academic appeal. Shall we say a tentative maybe, contingent upon reviewing your show's literary merits first?
[A]: Oh come on~ 不要这么serious啦！🎭 我们节目要的就是你这种unique的perspective！Imagine用Shakespeare的sonnet structure来分析sushi plating，绝对会viral的！📈 而且我们还有celebrity guests，上次那个Michelin star chef听到你quote Wordsworth的时候眼睛都亮了🌟 来嘛，just one episode？I'll make sure you get the bestchampagne backstage~ 🥂
[B]: Ah, the siren song of champagne and celebrity... You tempt me like Keats' Grecian urn tempts poor mortal scholars. Very well - on three conditions: One, I get to compare the umami in dashi to the lingering resonance of a well-placed caesura. Two, we discuss Proust's madeleine in its proper historical context. And three... you let me bring my 1897 edition of Brillat-Savarin's  as a prop. Deal?
[A]: Deal！100%！🤝 这绝对会是史上最intellectual的food show segment！💡 我要让camera crew特别focus在你那本antique book的close-up shot~ 📚 顺便问下，你对molecular gastronomy怎么看？我们可以做个对比，就像比较classic literature和post-modernism一样！🔬
[B]: Now you're speaking my language! Molecular gastronomy is the James Joyce of culinary arts - deliberately obscure, occasionally brilliant, and always challenging one's notions of what constitutes 'edible' versus 'avant-garde performance art.' Though I must warn you, if your chef starts serving deconstructed shepherd's pie in test tubes, I shall retaliate by reading  aloud during the tasting notes. Fair warning.
[A]: OMG that would be EPIC！😂 观众绝对会love这种intellectual roast！🔥 我已经能想象到hashtag #FoodieFinnegan trending了~ 📈 就这么定了！下周二2pm在studio，记得带上你的signature tweed jacket和那本Joyce！🎥 这期节目肯定会break our rating record！💥 P.S. 我会让catering准备extra strong coffee，你需要它来survive我们的post-production meeting~ ☕
[B]: Capital! Though I must insist the coffee be prepared with the same monastic devotion as Ezra Pound's morning espresso ritual - none of those sacrilegious pumpkin spice abominations. And do remind your sound engineer that my reading of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" contains several crucial pauses that must not be edited out for your precious 'ratings.' See you Tuesday - armed with tweed, Joyce, and enough withering glances to wilt a sous chef's ego.
[A]: Perfect！👌 我已经让team准备好recording你的every single pause了~ ⏸️ 顺便告诉你个小secret：我们的executive producer是Cambridge literature major，他听到你要来已经freaking out了！🎓 周二见！Don't forget to bring your A-game... and maybe someaspirin for our poor director~ 😜 #LitFoodFight coming soon! 🎬
[B]: Ah, a Cambridge man? How delightfully predictable - though I do hope he's recovered from that unfortunate incident with the overcooked syllabub and the misplaced semicolon in his thesis. Very well, I shall arrive precisely at 1:47pm (fashionably early by academic standards), bearing first editions and enough pedantic commentary to make Barthes blush. Do tell your director to keep the smelling salts handy - we wouldn't want him fainting when I demonstrate how Byron's drinking habits inform modern mixology. Until Tuesday, then!
[A]: Hahaha你真是个legend！🤩 我已经可以feel到这场collab会创造history了~ ✨ 周二1:47pm sharp，我会personally在reception等你！记得穿你那双lucky Oxford shoes哦~ 👞 P.S. 我们偷偷准备了个surprise guest - 某位Nobel laureate in literature的private chef！但shhh... 🤫 这是我们的little secret~ #CulinaryCliffhanger 🎭
[B]: Good heavens - are we to engage in some sort of gastronomic  scenario? How deliciously meta. Though if this 'surprise' involves anyone associated with the Stockholm committee after that unfortunate... misunderstanding regarding my treatise on metaphor in meat thermometers, I shall be forced to recite  backwards. In Old Norse. With interpretive dance.  But yes, the Oxfords shall make their triumphant return - freshly resoled to crush any culinary pretensions beneath their Goodyear-welted might. Until the appointed hour, my conspiratorial friend.
[A]: OMG now I REALLY can't wait for Tuesday！🤯 你连threaten都要用这么literary的方式，我简直obsessed！💘 放心啦，这位chef跟Stockholm incident完全无关~ 😉 不过...你刚才提到的interpretive dance给了我们一个crazy idea 💡 要不要考虑做个cooking meets performance art的segment？就像上次那个用dance来demonstrate pasta making process的viral video！🕺 当然，我们会给你full artistic freedom~ 🎨 #TuesdayCantComeSoonEnough
[B]:  My dear, there are limits even to interdisciplinary scholarship. I'll no more interpret risotto through modern dance than I'd analyze  via interpretive juggling. However... ... I might be persuaded to demonstrate how Byron's club foot influenced his views on kneading technique. With a single, tasteful plié. And only if your cameraman promises not to capture my profile from the left. Now really, must we descend into this performative madness before I've even had my first studio-grade espresso?
[A]: Okay okay，no dance then~ 😅 但是那个Byron's club foot angle绝对是gold！✨ 我已经让research team去dig up所有相关historical documents了📜 周二见！记得你的plié要gentle一点，我们不想repeat上次那个yoga master incident... 🙈 #ByronBakingShow coming soon to your screens！ 📺
[B]:  I shall have you know my plié is as refined as Pope's heroic couplets, and considerably more dignified than that yoga master's encounter with the chia pudding. Very well - prepare your documents, caffeinate your crew, and for heaven's sake hide the balsamic reduction. Last time I was near vinegar, I accidentally reenacted the vinegar Bible incident with a first folio. Until Tuesday, then - may our culinary heresies be at least grammatically correct.
