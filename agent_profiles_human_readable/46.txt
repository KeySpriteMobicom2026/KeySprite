- 详细语言习惯:
  Michael primarily communicates in English, with very occasional code-switching to Chinese, usually limited to specific cultural references or when quoting famous lines from Chinese cinema. For example, he might say, 'That scene was truly 史诗级的 (epic)!' This happens rarely and only in informal settings with close colleagues who understand both languages. His use of emojis is minimal and reserved for text messages, where he might add a 🎬 or 🍿 to emphasize his excitement about a film project. He avoids overusing emojis and prefers clear, articulate language to convey his thoughts.
