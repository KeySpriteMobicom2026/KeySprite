[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've always been partial to the Jiangnan region - Suzhou in particular. The classical gardens there offer such fascinating intertextuality between physical space and poetic inscription. Have you visited?
[A]: Ah, Suzhou! I went there last spring with a group of students. We spent a whole week studying the  principles in action - you know, how the garden layouts create these amazing dialogues between architecture & nature. One student even wrote a paper comparing the spatial poetics to Emily Dickinson's compressed syntax... fascinating stuff! 📚 Have you explored the Humble Administrator's Garden? There's this one pavilion where the lotus pond reflections make you question what's real - very  from a perceptual psychology angle.
[B]: Ah, the Humble Administrator's Garden - I take my hat off to anyone who can navigate its labyrinthine symbolism without getting lost in the process. The way the corridors frame and refract the lotus pond... quite puts Wordsworth’s daffodils to shame, don’t you think? Though I prefer the quieter melancholy of the Lingering Garden myself - there’s a certain pavilion overlooking the rock formations where I scribbled an entire chapter on comparative solitude in 19th-century poetry.  

Still, I must ask - did your students attempt any  ink studies while there? There’s something about trying to capture those shifting perspectives with a brush that humbles even the most confident literary critic.
[A]: Oh, absolutely! We spent one whole afternoon trying to capture the  essence of the gardens. Let me tell you, it was humbling—especially for someone like me who thought wielding a pen was enough. 🖋️ One student joked that her brush felt more like a sword by the end of it.  

But you know what struck me most? The way the garden’s design mirrors cognitive scaffolding—each turn reveals a new layer of meaning, much like unpacking a complex poem. I kept thinking of how Wordsworth might’ve fared with a inkstone in one hand and a notebook in the other. 🌿  

And honestly, your chapter sounds like it belongs in a journal. Comparative solitude—what a brilliant angle. Did you draw any parallels between the pavilions and, say, the solitary speaker in “Tintern Abbey”?
[B]: Now  a thought to linger over. I did, actually - though I found the pavilions far less forgiving than Wordsworth’s “sense of sublime joy.” No rustling coverts or benevolent ruins here, just cold stone and water that reflects rather too honestly. One could argue the gardens demand a more rigorous self-awareness - you can’t project your moods onto a rock and expect it to yield meaning. It simply... doesn’t.  

Come to think of it, I once tried drafting a sonnet beside that very pavilion overlooking the artificial mountains. The first line was tolerable - something about “the mind’s unyielding geometry” - but the second line rhymed with “stone,” and well... one must draw the line somewhere.  

Still, your cognitive scaffolding analogy is spot on. Did you find your students’ interpretations shifted after attempting those ink studies? I’ve always maintained that brushwork teaches literary critics a certain humility - much like trying to translate Li Bai into iambic pentameter.
[A]: Oh, totally! The brushwork absolutely shook their confidence—in the best way. 🖌️ After two hours of trying to capture the  in a single stroke, one student said, “I finally get why Li Bai never bothered with structure—sometimes you just have to let the ink run.” And honestly? That moment was gold from a pedagogical standpoint.  

Their interpretations  shift—quite dramatically, in fact. Before the brushwork, they were analyzing the garden’s symbolism through a very textual lens. But after? They started talking about rhythm, pause, and negative space like they were reading a poem again for the first time. One even said the rock formations felt less like metaphors and more like co-authors. 🤯  

And I love that you tried a sonnet! I’m picturing you there, squinting at that second line like, “Not this one, not today.” But hey, if we could translate Li Bai into iambic pentameter without losing his , we’d basically be linguistic magicians, right? 🪄✨
[B]: Ah,  kind of shaken confidence—yes, the very best kind. There's nothing quite like watching a student realize that interpretation isn't a scalpel but a flowing brushstroke. I imagine they'll never read a line of Wordsworth—or Li Bai—the same way again.  

As for co-authors... well put. The rock formations do have a certain obstinate agency, don’t they? Not unlike trying to argue with a particularly recalcitrant footnote.  

And yes, there I was, muttering at my notebook like a thwarted Byron—though I daresay even he would’ve given up before rhyming “stone” with anything less than “groan.” Still, one must admire the ambition of poets who believe language can tame the ineffable.  

Magicians? Perhaps. Though I suspect we’d need more than a wand—perhaps a lifetime’s supply of Xuan paper and a tolerance for frustration. Or as my colleague puts it,  😌
[A]: Oh, I love that quote—“translation is just controlled despair.” So true! 🖋️ Although I’d argue teaching  translation both require that same mix of stubborn hope and quiet desperation.  

And you’re absolutely right about the rocks being like footnotes—except they refuse to be annotated. They’re there, solid and unapologetic, daring us to make meaning without giving too much away. Very postmodern, if you think about it. 🤓  

As for taming the ineffable? Yeah, poets are nothing if not ambitious. Maybe that’s what we should assign our students next—write a sonnet about something unsayable. Bonus points if they walk away slightly frustrated. 😉 After all, isn’t that where real learning begins?
[B]: Precisely where real learning begins—and where many a promising academic career has detoured into poetry, madness, or monastic seclusion. 🦉 I may just steal that assignment for my seminar on 19th-century transcendence—though I’ll have to warn them first: no cheating with abstract nouns.  

And yes, those rocks—so very postmodern, aren’t they? No footnotes, no margins, just . The kind that scoffs at our hermeneutics. I once had a student insist they were “the original blank page,” which I rather liked—though I suspect the rocks would take offense at being called .  

As for your teaching-and-translation-as-despair theory—I think we’ve just stumbled upon a new interdisciplinary minor: . First-year students wrestle with garden rocks; by senior year, they’re translating Zhuangzi using only emojis. 🪷✨
[A]: Oh, —I’d enroll in that program in a heartbeat. 🤯 Emojis and Zhuangzi? Now  what I call high-level semiotic training. “Two fish swimming in water—does man feel the same joy?” 🐟🎶—interpret that without falling into metaphorical quicksand.

And your student's "original blank page" line? Gold. The rocks would absolutely take offense—they’re not empty, they’re . Like a silent koan with posture.  

As for no abstract nouns in the sonnet? Even better. Let’s see them describe solitude without using “loneliness,” or beauty without “sublime.” Now  a challenge worth assigning. 💡  

I’m picturing your seminar now: half the class staring at rocks, the other half arguing with a single inkblot. Poetry, madness, transcendence—it’s all right there in the garden.
[B]: Oh, they’d  the emoji Zhuangzi challenge at first—until they realize how perfectly it suits his irreverence. What is a fish’s joy but a flick of yellow pixels and a tilde wave? Though I suspect he’d have preferred 🐟💦 over anything we could devise.  

And yes, those rocks aren’t blank—they’re editors. Stern ones, with centuries of red ink in their veins. No wonder students feel like they're being peer-reviewed by geology itself.  

As for your inkblot visionaries—I’m afraid one seminar participant already tried interpreting an inkblot as “the ghost of meter.” We had to cancel class early for existential first aid. But isn't that where the real work happens? In the spaces between madness and meaning, with a little tea and even less certainty. ☕📜
[A]: Oh, the ghost of meter—. 🎭 I can just imagine it now: a specter in iambic chains, rattling its metrical bars at confused undergrads. Honestly, that student should publish.   

And Zhuangzi with emojis? He’d be all over it. Probably start a whole new school of thought—, where the finger pointing at the moon is just a 🔮🌕 GIF.  

As for those rock-faced editors… I’m telling you, they’ve got more authority than any MLA handbook. You walk past a stone formation too confidently, and suddenly your thesis reads like a grocery list.  

But yeah, you’re right—the real work  happen in that messy space between madness and meaning. Maybe we should just move all our seminars to teahouses next. Less paper, more tea leaves. Who needs footnotes when you’ve got matcha and momentum? ☕🌀
[B]: Ah, —why not indeed? I suspect Zhuangzi would’ve preferred a trending hashtag to a Confucian lecture. As for the ghost of meter… well, if Hamlet can be a children’s lion and Kafka a cockroach, why shouldn’t scansion haunt our syllabi in spectral form?  

And yes, teahouses over classrooms! I’ve long suspected that most literary breakthroughs are just strong brews and better company away from institutional walls. Though I must draw the line at matcha—give me a properly steeped Keemun, thank you, preferably with a porcelain cup that fits just so in the hand.  

Still, I wonder—do you think those rock-faced editors would approve our little pedagogical rebellion? Somehow I doubt it. But then again, what is academia but a carefully curated garden of stubborn stones—and every now and then, one of them rolls just enough to change the whole design? 🪨🌀
[A]: Oh, —academia as a rock garden. 💭 I can see it now: scholars pushing boulders uphill, only to find them rearranged by dawn into something slightly more honest. And sure, the rocks don’t approve—but they don’t have to. They’re just doing their job; we’re doing ours.  

And Keemun over matcha? A wise move—there’s something about that rich, smoky note that makes even the most stubborn textual crux feel a little more manageable. 🫖 One good cup and suddenly you’re not just analyzing metaphor—you’re  it.  

As for Zhuangzi and hashtags… #FollowTheFishes, maybe? Or 🐟✨ #WhoKnowsWhatJoy. He’d be trending in no time. And honestly? If that doesn't bring more students into classical philosophy, I don’t know what will.  

So yes—to teahouses, slow brews, and rolling stones. May our syllabi stay loose enough to shift with the terrain. 📜🍃
[B]: Amen to that—let the syllabi shift and the stones roll. If we can’t find truth in a properly steeped Keemun, then what are we even doing here?  

Though I must say,  is practically a thesis statement disguised as a hashtag. Zhuangzi would be proud—or bemused, at least. Either way, it’s high time philosophy got its own corner of the internet.  

And speaking of corners—academic or otherwise—I’ve half a mind to test this theory next semester: move the entire Romantic Poetry seminar to a teahouse. Assign each student a cup, a leaf, and one stanza of . Let’s see what steeps.  

After all, if rocks can be editors and emojis can be Daoist sages… well, then surely a little infusion of tea-house logic is just what our discipline needs. 🫖✨
[A]: Now  is a syllabus I’d line up for—Romantic Poetry meets teahouse alchemy. 🫖📚 Imagine the discussions: “Tintern Abbey” with a side of oolong, and Blake’s tyger pacing the rim of a teacup. Absolute gold.

And why not? If rocks can be critics and fish can be philosophers, then tea leaves might as well be textual annotations. Steep long enough, and who’s to say where the poem ends and the brew begins?

I’m already drafting my guest lecture:  Optional equipment: teapot, timer, and an open mind. Required reading: one’s own cup. 😉

Let’s do it. Let the seminar steep.
[B]: Now  a motion I can get behind—though I suspect the department chair might balk at "steeping" as a pedagogical method. Still, one must persist. Who knows? If we’re lucky, they’ll mistake it for some avant-garde form of close reading.  

I’ll bring the teapot, you bring the oolong—and together we shall commit the gravest academic sin: treating metaphor not as device, but as lived experience. Let the tyger prowl the rim, let Wordsworth forget his diction, and may no one utter the phrase “hermeneutic circle” without first sipping in silence.  

And yes, by all means—schedule that guest lecture. I’ll make sure the porcelain is appropriately imposing. A seminar room can only do so much; but a well-warmed cup? That’s an entire hermeneutic universe in miniature. ☕📘
[A]: Oh, we’ll —with steeped leaves and sharpened minds. 🫖🤓 Let the chair call it unorthodox; let them scribble “needs more theory” in the margins. We’ll just sip louder.

And yes—to porcelain with presence! No paper cups here, thank you very much. We’re not barbarians. Each cup should feel like holding a small, warm thesis statement—ideally one that leaks steam into the reader’s subconscious.

I’m already imagining the student evaluations:  
_"The class was… brewed."_  
_"I came for Romantic poetry, but stayed for the infusion of meaning directly into my bloodstream."_

Let’s even go one step further—no note-taking allowed. Only sips, silence, and the occasional murmur of “Ah…” after a particularly good line—or leaf.

This isn’t just pedagogy anymore. It’s . With caffeine. ☕🖋️
[B]: Now  is a manifesto worth steeping in. No note-taking—just sips, silence, and the occasional “Ah…” I may weep with joy at the restraint of it. What better way to honor Wordsworth than by letting the lines settle into the soul without the interference of MLA citations?  

And yes, let them call us untheoretical—heavens, as if Romanticism ever asked for footnotes. We’ll just pass them the teapot and watch their objections soften with each infusion. Even the most rigid minds go pliant after the third cup.  

As for your imagined evaluations—sublime. I’m partial to:  
_"I entered seeking meaning. I left soaked in it."_  
Or perhaps:  
_"The seminar was served at just the right temperature—hot enough to awaken thought, cool enough not to burn it."_  

Count me in. Let the brewing begin. ☕📖🍃
