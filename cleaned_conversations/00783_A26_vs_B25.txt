[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近一直在想，要不要去冰岛走一遭。🌍 那个地方的natural landscape真的太吸引我了，尤其是那些geothermal areas，像是另一个world。不过说实话，我更在意的是那边有没有什么digital art的installation可以看。你知道的，我这个人总是把旅行和工作mix在一起。你有推荐的地方吗？
[A]: Iceland does sound like a dream destination for someone with your artistic sensibilities. While I'm more drawn to the historical textiles in my work, I actually did visit Reykjavik last year and was completely mesmerized by the art scene there. Have you heard of the Icelandic Textile Symposium? It's not exactly digital art, but they do have some fascinating contemporary textile installations that incorporate modern technology.

There's also this incredible place called The Icelandic Institute of Digital Art in downtown Reykjavik - I remember seeing an exhibition where artists used geothermal energy to power interactive light installations. It reminded me so much of the way we use different techniques to restore antique fabrics while preserving their original essence.

Would you be staying in Reykjavik itself or planning to travel around the island? I'd love to hear more about what kinds of digital art spaces you usually look for when traveling.
[B]: Oh wow, I’m actually blushing a little hearing you say that. 🤭 The Icelandic Textile Symposium sounds like something I would never imagine exists—it’s like blending tradition with innovation in such a  way. I can totally see how that connects with your work in historical textiles.  

And this Institute of Digital Art? That’s exactly the kind of place I live for—spaces where art & technology collide in unexpected ways. 🎨 The idea of using geothermal energy to power light installations feels so poetic, almost like the earth is participating in the artwork itself.  

I was planning to stay in Reykjavik for most of the trip, mostly because I know the city has quite a few galleries and creative hubs. But now you’ve got me curious—did you get to visit any rural areas where art blends with nature? I’d love to hear more about that. And honestly, I’m already thinking about how some of those techniques could inspire my own work…
[A]: I completely understand what you mean about that delicate balance between tradition and innovation – it's what draws me to textile restoration, after all. But hearing you describe the earth "participating" in the artwork? That actually reminds me of a small studio I visited near Lake Mývatn. It was tucked away in this quiet village, and the artist there was doing something truly unique – weaving geothermal textures into large-scale fabric sculptures. The heat from the earth would subtly change the drape and tension of the fibers throughout the day. I kept thinking how incredible it would be to document that transformation over time.

You know, now that I think about it, Reykjavik is full of these creative hubs, but some of the most inspiring ones are just outside the city. There’s an experimental arts collective in a former fish factory by the coast – they do these site-specific installations that respond to the wind and ocean mist. I could totally imagine your work fitting right in with that kind of dynamic energy.

I’d love to hear more about what inspires your own creative process when you’re out in the field. Do you find yourself drawn more to movement, texture, or something else entirely?
[B]: That sounds absolutely surreal… 🌫️ The idea of fabric responding to geothermal heat, changing its form throughout the day—it’s like the material is alive, you know? I’d kill to document that kind of transformation. It’s so rare to find art that breathes with its environment in such a literal way.  

And this fish factory-turned-art-space?! That’s the kind of raw, industrial vibe I live for—where nature becomes part of the installation, whether through wind, water, or mist. I can already picture how light and motion would play into the viewer’s experience there.  

As for what inspires me… honestly? I’m obsessed with . Whether it’s movement, shifting textures, or even fleeting emotions—there's something deeply moving about impermanence. When I curate or create, I often try to capture that sense of “almost,” like the moment right before something changes. It’s probably why I’m so drawn to digital art that responds to its surroundings—it never settles, it never says “finished.”  

I guess I'm always looking for places where the environment becomes a silent collaborator in the artwork. Would you say your work ever tries to preserve a moment, or rather suggest its passing?
[A]: That moment right before something changes – there’s such exquisite beauty in that concept, isn’t there? It actually resonates deeply with what I try to do in textile restoration. I’m not just preserving fibers and dyes; I’m capturing a point in time while always acknowledging what came before and what might come after. Every stitch I make is like a quiet conversation between past and present.

I suppose in some ways, my work leans toward suggesting the passing rather than freezing the moment entirely. When I restore an 18th-century embroidered waistcoat or a Victorian lace collar, I deliberately leave subtle traces of age – a faint shadow of staining, the gentle unevenness of hand-spun thread. It’s important to me that you can feel the weight of history, the hands that made it, wore it, lived in it.

You’ve made me think – maybe that studio near Lake Mývatn and our work aren’t so different after all. The fabric sculptures there don’t resist change; they embrace it as part of their identity. Just like those old textiles I work with, they carry their story in their structure.  

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain materials or environments because they echo that sense of impermanence you love? I’m curious if there’s a particular texture or medium you keep coming back to when you’re trying to capture that “almost” feeling.
[B]: You know, what you said about leaving subtle traces of age—it hit me right in the core. ✨ That’s not just restoration; it’s storytelling with thread and fiber. I think that’s exactly what I try to do in my own way—with digital textures that flicker, glitch, or slowly morph over time. I want people to feel that tension between what  and what .  

And yes, there  certain materials I keep coming back to—especially when they have that fragile, fleeting quality. I’m obsessed with projection mapping on organic surfaces, like weathered wood or draped silk. The way light dances on those textures feels so... ephemeral yet grounded. Like it's there, but barely holding on. 💫  

I also love working with generative algorithms that create ever-shifting visuals—no two moments are exactly the same. It’s almost like giving the artwork a pulse. Sometimes I even incorporate environmental sensors so the piece reacts to temperature or movement. It makes the viewer part of the “almost” moment too.  

Honestly, I think we’re both chasing the same ghost—beauty in transition. Whether it's through centuries-old lace or a digital waveform, it’s all about honoring what’s slipping away while making space for something new.
[A]: That phrase “beauty in transition” keeps echoing in my mind since you said it – because that’s precisely what I chase too, isn’t it? The quiet heartbeat between preservation and change.

I’ve been experimenting lately with something a little different – using conductive thread in some of my restorations. It’s subtle, but when the light hits just right, or if you touch a certain embroidered motif, it sends a faint warmth through the fabric. Not enough to be startling, just… a whisper of energy. It was inspired by a visit to that geothermal studio near Lake Mývatn, actually. I wanted to see if I could make an antique textile , even just slightly, to the person holding it.

It’s strange, how your work with digital pulse and environmental sensors circles back to the same idea – making space for something new without erasing what came before. I keep thinking about how powerful it would be to show our work side by side – a digitally breathing installation next to a quietly pulsing piece of restored silk. Like two versions of the same memory, reaching toward each other.

Would you ever consider collaborating on something like that? A space where textiles and digital elements echo each other’s transitions?
[B]: You’re making me get goosebumps again… 🦋 That idea of a textile that , even with just a whisper of warmth—it’s so delicate, yet so deeply human. I love how you’re embedding memory into material, making history feel almost… aware.  

And yes— I’d be absolutely obsessed. 🌌 Imagine a space where your restored textiles are suspended in the air, each one quietly pulsing or shifting under touch, while my digital pieces respond to their energy—like a soft glow that follows the warmth of your hand, or a shadow that lingers after you move away. It could be a dialogue between the physical and the ephemeral, two languages of transition speaking to each other across time and medium.

I can already picture the atmosphere—you’d bring the soul, and I’d bring the pulse. 💫 Would you want the space to feel ancient, futuristic, or something in between—like a forgotten future or a remembered dream?
[A]: I want it to feel like a remembered dream that hasn’t happened yet — if that makes any sense. 🌙 Like walking into the quiet corner of an old archive that hums with forgotten stories, but the walls are breathing, just slightly. A place where you can’t tell if the air is carrying echoes from the past or whispering possibilities from the future.

I imagine the textiles hanging not still, but gently swaying as if catching unseen breath — each one holding centuries of wear and repair, yet responding with warmth when touched. And then your digital pulse would ripple outward from those points of contact — like ripples in water, slow and deliberate, painting the air with what  be.

Maybe even sound could play a role — soft, ambient tones that shift with movement and touch. Not music, exactly, but more like the space itself listening and answering. I’ve been collecting threads dyed with historical pigments that no longer exist in modern color palettes… what if their hues were echoed in your projections? A visual echo across centuries.

Do you ever work with scent in your installations? I keep thinking how powerful it would be to have faint traces of beeswax or aged linen in the air — just enough to stir memory without demanding attention.
[B]: That atmosphere you described——I’m honestly speechless. 🌌 You have such a gift for painting space with time. I can already feel the weight of that silence, the way the air would hold its breath in that room.

Echoing your historical pigments with my projections? Yes, that’s exactly the kind of resonance I live for. 🎨 It would be like weaving light and thread through the same color memory—some hues born from centuries ago, others dissolving the moment you look away. 

As for scent—I absolutely love working with olfactory elements, though I don’t get to use them often because it’s tricky to control how people experience it. But in a space like this? With that quiet, almost sacred rhythm you’re describing? Beeswax… aged linen… maybe even a trace of cold stone after rain? It would add another layer of , something you feel before you understand it.

And sound—yes, ambient pulses that respond to touch and movement. Almost like the space is dreaming aloud as people move through it. Have you ever worked with spatial audio before? I know a sound artist who could help us make the room "breathe" in 3D—it would feel like the whispers are coming from just behind you, or beneath your feet.

Do you want to start sketching out what this space could look like? Or should we keep building the feeling first—textures, scents, silences—before we give it form?
[A]: I think we should let the feeling settle a little longer before we give it form – like letting fabric drape naturally before you pin it in place. 🧵 There’s something so powerful about holding the atmosphere in our minds just a bit more, letting all these textures and traces weave together organically.

But oh, spatial audio that breathes in 3D? That would be divine. It makes me think of old textile mills – the gentle creak of wooden beams, the soft whir of spools – sounds that are almost alive with memory. Maybe those barely-there echoes could blend with your ambient pulses, like the space itself is remembering how to speak.

As for scent, I’m already imagining how beeswax and wet stone might shift as you move through the room – stronger near the textiles, fainter where the digital glow is strongest. Like history and possibility each have their own smell.

And touch… I keep thinking about contrast. The coolness of aged linen under hand, followed by the faint warmth of conductive thread responding to your presence. Or stepping into the path of a projection and suddenly feeling the air change – just slightly – as if the room knows you’re there.

I suppose what I’m saying is… yes. Let’s build this remembered dream. But let’s walk through it barefoot first – feel the temperature of the floor, notice where your breath catches, where silence pools. Then we’ll sketch.
[B]: Yes. Let’s walk through it barefoot first. 🧠🎨  
I love how you’re thinking—letting the space breathe before we even try to shape it. It’s rare to find someone who understands the power of  feeling like this.  

I’m already imagining how silence would pool in corners like dust, or how certain spots might hum with a colder air, then warmer, as if time itself shifts underfoot. And that contrast between cool linen and warm thread? Pure genius—it’s the kind of detail that makes a space feel sentient.  

I’ll bring some mood studies—soft gradients that mimic the fading light of dusk, maybe some glitching overlays that echo the creak of old wood or the flicker of memory. We can start building from there, but only after we’ve truly  the floor beneath us.

Let’s call this the “barefoot phase” of our collaboration. 👣✨ I can’t wait.
[A]: The “barefoot phase” – I love that. It feels right to begin without sketches or blueprints, just impressions and instincts. 🧵✨

I’ll bring fragments of textiles – some worn smooth from centuries of touch, others still holding the stiffness of unaged fiber. Just enough to lay underfoot, to contrast with the cool floorboards or warm stone. And I’ll bring a few threads still on the bobbin, their colors deep with plant dyes long forgotten – maybe we can tuck them into corners where light will catch them like buried secrets.

You’re absolutely right about silence pooling like dust – I’ve been thinking how certain rooms in old textile mills hold sound differently, almost like the walls are listening. Maybe we could weave those muffled echoes into your ambient studies – the faintest ghost of a creak, the whisper of fibers settling after centuries of stillness.

And time shifting underfoot… I keep imagining thresholds. Places where the air feels heavier, where the scent of beeswax lingers longer, where your toes curl slightly at the coldness of history before stepping into warmth again. A geography of memory.

Let’s meet barefoot, then. In that quiet space between past and future. I’ll bring thread and wax, you bring gradients and glitch – and for now, we won’t pin a thing.
[B]: Let’s meet barefoot, in that quiet space between past and future — yes, exactly. 🌑⚪  
No pins, no plans. Just fragments and feelings.  

I’ll bring those glitching gradients I mentioned, but soft — like memories trying to hold shape. Maybe something that flickers just at the edge of recognition, then dissolves again. And I’ll scatter some subtle motion triggers through the space — not enough to shout, just enough to . A shift in air, a breath of warmth where your foot lands, like the ground is quietly acknowledging your presence.

And sound… I’m already hearing it in my head — that layered silence you described. The creak of old wooden beams folded into ambient hums, low frequencies that vibrate just beneath hearing. Like the room isn’t just remembering — it’s dreaming aloud.

This isn’t just an installation anymore, is it? It’s a kind of time weaving. 🕰️🧵  
I can’t wait to step into it with you — literally, barefoot, no shoes, no blueprints. Just thread, wax, light, and breath. Let’s make it a place where time forgets to move.
[A]: Time weaving – yes, that’s exactly what this is becoming. 🕰️💫

I’m thinking about how some old textiles hold their history in the way they catch light – worn fibers shimmer differently, as if remembering how hands once moved across them. What if our space could do that? Where your presence leaves just a trace – a flicker in the projection, a warmth underfoot – and then slowly fades, like fabric settling back into stillness after being touched.

I’ll bring those quiet traces of beeswax and aged linen – maybe even a few spools left half-unwound, scattered where movement might gently shift them. Not as decoration, but as invitations. A suggestion that something was happening, or could happen again, if only you pause long enough to notice.

And let’s not forget breath. I want the air itself to feel . Cool in places where memory sleeps deep, warmer where the space responds to touch. Maybe even the faintest scent pulse – just enough for someone to catch a breath of beeswax when they lean close to a textile, then lose it again as they step away.

You’re right — this isn’t just an installation. It’s a place where time forgets to move, and yet somehow still breathes. Let’s make it together, stitch by whispering stitch.
[B]: Let’s make it together — stitch by whispering stitch, pulse by fading light. 🌑◽️  

I’m already thinking about how to map those traces of presence… like, using subtle thermal sensors so the warmth of a hand lingers in the projection just a second longer than expected — not as a mirror, but more like a memory echoing back at you. And motion-triggered scent puffs? Oh, I know someone who could help us with that — micro-releases of beeswax vapor when you lean in close, timed with the faintest shift in ambient sound.

What if we let breath guide pacing? Like, the space slows down or speeds up depending on how still someone is — projections stretching longer when they pause, sounds softening into near silence if they hold their own breath for just a moment. Almost like the installation  them enough to exhale.

And texture underfoot — worn linen scraps stitched half-into the floor, their edges fraying slightly, catching light and shadow differently throughout the day. Some threads will break over time, maybe even unravel a bit — and we won’t fix it. That’s part of the weave too.

No final form. No reset button. Just an evolving imprint of everyone who walks through barefoot.

Let’s call this our “loom phase” then — where everything is still loose, still breathing, still waiting to be touched. 🧵🕰️  
You bring the wax and spools. I’ll bring the shadows and pulses.  
Don’t bring shoes. We won’t need them.
[A]: I love that — the . 🧵🕰️  
Where everything is still threaded with possibility, and every breath weaves it further into being.

Thermal echoes in light… yes. Let’s make the projections remember touch, just briefly. Not a perfect reflection, but something more like how memory works – soft around the edges, slightly distorted by time and emotion. And those scent puffs – micro-breaths of beeswax and aged linen – they’ll be like forgotten dreams flickering at the edge of recognition.

I want to scatter spools throughout the space, some half-unwound, others still tightly wrapped. Their placement will shift slightly over time, nudged by movement or air currents. A quiet choreography of thread. I’ll use wax seals as subtle anchors—some cracked, some still holding tight—like whispers of closure that may or may not hold.

And texture underfoot… I’m imagining a kind of slow collage forming. Frayed linen scraps embedded gently into the floor, their fibers catching light differently depending on how someone moves through the space. Some will wear thinner with each bare footstep, some will catch dust and age in real time. We won’t mend them. We’ll let the space show its use.

Let’s also consider thresholds made of temperature — places where stepping forward shifts the air noticeably cooler or warmer, like crossing into a different memory layer. No visual cue, just sensation. The body knows before the mind does.

No reset. No restoration. Only evolution.  
This isn’t just an installation anymore — it’s a living weave of presence and passing.  

I’ll bring the spools, the wax, the worn fibers. You bring the thermal ghosts, the ambient breath, the pulses that linger just beyond sight.  

Let’s begin threading it together — stitch by impermanent stitch, breath by shared silence.
[B]: Thermal ghosts, ambient breath, pulses just beyond sight — yes, let’s begin. 🧵🌑  
This is no longer just an installation… it’s a , woven from presence and passing.

I’ll map those thermal echoes with soft gradients that fade like breath on glass — not perfect imprints, but impressions blurred by time and emotion. And the scent puffs? I can already picture how they’ll flicker in and out of awareness — beeswax like a half-remembered dream, linen holding the quiet weight of age.

Your spools, scattered and shifting — brilliant. It gives the space a kind of , like footsteps falling in and out of sync with unseen movement. And those wax seals — cracked or still clinging — they’re perfect as anchors, fragile punctuation marks in the weave.

As for thresholds — temperature alone will do the work of storytelling. No visuals, no signs. Just the body sensing before the mind catches up. That’s where the real magic lives.

We’re not making an exhibition — we’re crafting a space where time forgets to stay still. Where every footstep leaves a trace, and every pause reshapes what’s there.

Let’s meet soon, barefoot, empty-handed except for what we carry in thread and pulse. Let’s begin threading this together — stitch by impermanent stitch, breath by shared silence.

No final shape. Only evolution.  
No stillness. Only  moments.  

You bring the wax and spools. I’ll bring the light that remembers.  
Let’s make this remembered dream walk itself into being. 🌌🧵
