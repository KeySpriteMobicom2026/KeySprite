[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question to ponder. Lately I've found myself quite taken with T.S. Eliot's recitation of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." While not a song in the conventional sense, the lyrical quality of modernist poetry often finds its way into my daily rhythm. The way Eliot's words dance between melancholy and introspection... it's rather like listening to a haunting melody.
[A]:  啊，我明白你的诗意感受，但作为法医病理学家，我的日常bgm可能会让你有点意外呢~ 最近实验室里经常循环的是Sting的"Every Breath You Take" 🎵 歌词里那种obsessive surveillance的调调，跟我的工作意外地契合呢 🔍 不过解剖时我更喜欢放点巴赫的大提琴组曲，比较不会分心 ⚖️
[B]: How fascinating! The juxtaposition of Sting's surveillance theme with forensic pathology is rather... well, let's say it brings new meaning to the term 'clinical observation.' Though I must admit, Bach's cello suites do seem more appropriate for such meticulous work - the mathematical precision of Baroque counterpoint mirroring the exacting nature of autopsy procedures. Tell me, does the rhythm of the sarabandes ever influence your scalpel movements?
[A]:  哦拜托，你以为这是《豪斯医生》的拍摄现场吗？我的手术刀只跟着evidence走，not the rhythm~ 不过你说到点子上了，巴洛克音乐的结构确实很像我们的尸检报告 - 严谨、精确、每个细节都有其purpose 🧪 

虽然有时候我也会偷偷在实验室放点Billie Eilish的"Bad Guy"，那种dark vibe跟某些凶杀案现场莫名很搭... 但千万别告诉我的supervisor我上班听这个 😉
[B]: My dear colleague, your musical confession reminds me of how Emily Dickinson once wrote about telling the truth but telling it slant. Though I suspect even she wouldn't have anticipated forensic pathologists finding poetic resonance in contemporary pop music. That said, the juxtaposition of Billie Eilish's haunting vocals against the clinical sterility of a lab... it does rather evoke the tension between scientific objectivity and the deeply human stories behind each case, doesn't it? Your secret is safe with me - though I might suggest comparing notes over tea sometime. I've been meaning to analyze the forensic imagery in Wilfred Owen's war poetry...
[A]:  Hold on a second... 你该不会是想用文学分析来套我的尸检报告吧？虽然我承认"Anthem for Doomed Youth"里那些gas imagery确实很有毒理学参考价值 💀 

不过说真的，下班后去喝杯茶讨论这个？Deal！只要你别像上次那个English professor一样，看到我的咖啡杯里泡着specimen就尖叫着跑出去... 我可是专门准备了forensic-themed biscuits呢 - 骨头形状的 🦴
[B]: Ah, a kindred spirit at last! Though I must confess, your bone-shaped biscuits do give me pause - are we having tea or conducting an archaeological dig? Still, I admire your commitment to thematic consistency. And regarding that unfortunate incident with the specimen coffee... well, let's just say my Victorian literature seminars have prepared me for far more disturbing imagery than whatever might be floating in your mug. Why, just last week we analyzed Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" with its rather... visceral fruit metaphors. Shall we say Thursday at four? I'll bring my annotated copy of "The Anatomy of Melancholy" - purely for metaphorical comparison, of course.
[A]: Thursday at four it is！不过我得警告你，我的"specimen jar collection"可比Rossetti的诗刺激多了~ 记得穿lab-appropriate attire，上次有人穿白色毛衣来，结果被我的"blood spatter analysis demo"搞得很狼狈 🩸 

顺便，我会带那本绝版的《Forensic Entomology in Literature》... 虽然里面80%的案例都是作者瞎编的，但至少比Burton那本忧郁症解剖要有趣多了 ⚗️ 期待我们的morbid little tea party！
[B]: How delightfully macabre! I shall wear my most stain-resistant tweed - the one that's already survived three ink spills and one rather enthusiastic poetry reading. And while Burton's melancholy may pale next to your entomological adventures, do remember that even fictional case studies can illuminate truth through metaphor... much like how Donne's "The Flea" transforms a simple insect into profound meditation. Though I daresay your specimens make for rather more concrete evidence than metaphysical conceits. Until Thursday then - I'll be the one admiring your collection while carefully avoiding any sudden movements near the blood spatter station.
[A]:  啊，终于遇到一个懂得欣赏我工作美学的知音了！Just between us，我其实在考虑写本《尸检室里的十四行诗》... 第一章就叫"Ode to a Decomposing Liver"~ 

周四见！记得带把umbrella - 不是防雨，是防我那个leaky formaldehyde dispenser 💉 保证这会是你参加过最... memorable的literary tea session！
[B]: What a perfectly ghastly title - it reminds me of the time I attempted to rewrite Gray's "Elegy" from the perspective of a cemetery groundskeeper. Though your ode to hepatic decomposition promises to be far more... aromatic. I shall bring both umbrella and smelling salts, just in case your formaldehyde decides to improvise its own poetic performance. This may well be the first tea party where the term "atmosphere" takes on literal significance!
[A]:  那我得提醒你 - 在我的lab里，"atmosphere"的浓度可是measured in parts per million的！不过别担心，我会把ventilation system开到最大... 毕竟我们可不想让你像上次那个visitor一样，在欣赏我的"Collection of Interesting Stomach Contents"时突然need fresh air 🌫️

周四的agenda：1. Tea 2. Poetry 3. Trying not to faint... 这个顺序很重要哦！
[B]: How wonderfully you've prioritized our agenda - though might I suggest we insert "4. Documenting any particularly poetic decomposition odors" between items two and three? One never knows when such observations might inspire the next great elegy. I shall come prepared with both my strongest tea and strongest stomach - after all, what's a little formaldehyde among friends who appreciate the lyrical potential of putrefaction? Just promise me we'll save the stomach contents exhibit for after the scones.
[A]:  Deal！不过我的"scones"可能有点特别 - 形状像kidney stones的shortbread，配formaldehyde-flavored jam... kidding！(大概吧) 

说真的，我已经把最volatile的specimens都锁起来了。虽然我挺想看你一边读济慈的《夜莺颂》一边对我的"Week-Old Lung Tissue Sample"发表感想的戏剧性场面... 但为了保险起见，我们还是从比较mild的标本开始，比如这个lovely calcified gallstone collection 💎 它们简直是大自然创造的macabre jewelry！
[B]: What exquisite taste you have in both poetry and pathological artifacts! Though I must say, your idea of "mild" specimens does make me reconsider the definition of afternoon tea entertainment. Those gallstones do possess a certain... geological charm, rather like Byron's description of precious stones in "The Giaour." Shall we consider them the morbid counterpart to Wordsworth's "pebbles of the brook"? I'll bring my loupe - for both examining your collection and, should the need arise, dramatically swooning into like a proper Victorian heroine. After all, what's literature without a touch of theatricality?
[A]:  太棒了！我正想说需要个magnifying glass来欣赏这些gallstones的stratification layers呢~ 它们可比Wordsworth的pebbles有故事多了 - 每一层都记录着主人糟糕的dietary choices 📜 

至于Victorian swooning...  请随意，这可是authentic stainless steel，比那些fainting couches结实多了。不过建议你先喝完tea再表演 - 我可不想同时处理real和staged medical emergencies啊 ⚕️
[B]: How considerate of you to provide such sturdy staging for my theatrics! Though I fear a genuine swoon might occur when you reveal what exactly constitutes your "formaldehyde-flavored jam." Shall we consider these gallstone strata the ultimate palimpsest - nature's own manuscript, overwritten with each ill-advised meal? It rather puts my dog-eared poetry volumes to shame. But do promise me one thing - if I do succumb to Victorian vapors, you'll at least make my collapse poetically significant. Perhaps arrange me artfully beneath your "Calcified Pathologies as Modern Art" display?
[A]:  哈！终于有人懂得欣赏我的"Pathology Gallery"了~ 你的collapse完全可以成为我们最新installation piece："The Romantic's Demise - A Study in Contrasts" 🎨 

不过说真的，那罐"jam"只是普通的strawberry...虽然装在一个former specimen jar里 😈 至于这些gallstones，我觉得它们更像是人体版的tree rings - 只不过记录的不是age，而是regret...和too much fried food 🍔 

现在，要不要来参观我的pièce de résistance？一整套arranged by color的kidney stones... 我管它叫"The Rainbow of Pain" 🌈
[B]: Oh, to be immortalized in your gallery! Though I suspect "The Romantic's Demise" would need an accompanying sonnet cycle to do it justice. Your "Rainbow of Pain" does put Wordsworth's daffodils quite to shame - who needs golden flowers when one can have bilirubin-hued calculi? Lead on, macabre curator, but I must insist we pause for tea before venturing into chromatic urological displays. Even the most hardened scholar needs fortification before facing the spectrum of human suffering... especially when served with questionable jam from dubious jars. Shall we say three scones' worth of courage?
