[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近其实没怎么看综艺，倒是追了几部剧。前阵子在研究算法偏见的案例，顺带翻了两部科幻题材的剧集，算是工作相关吧。你呢？最近有看什么有意思的节目吗？
[A]: Oh, fascinating! I recently re-watched  series – it’s amazing how many of those episodes explore algorithmic bias and ethical dilemmas in technology, albeit through a more... artistic lens. One episode had this eerie take on predictive policing that reminded me a bit of what you're describing. Have you seen it? I’d love to hear your take if you have. Otherwise, there's a new series from South Korea called  – very moody and atmospheric, though not exactly light viewing. Still, if you're into the whole "isolated environment + ethical tech questions" vibe, it might be right up your alley.
[B]: Predictive policing, huh? That's a fascinating angle. I actually haven't seen  series you're referring to, but it sounds like it lines up perfectly with some of the frameworks we use to analyze AI governance. The idea of predictive systems making decisions that affect people's lives is exactly the kind of ethical gray zone I've been digging into lately.

 rings a bell—wasn’t there a lunar base involved? If it leans into the psychological strain of isolation while dealing with tech-driven moral quandaries, that could definitely work as a narrative lens for discussing accountability in automated decision-making. Have you found any particular scene or character dynamic that really crystallized those themes for you?
[A]: Oh, I love how you phrased that—"tech-driven moral quandaries." That’s  what the show leans into. There’s this one character, Dr. Song, who operates a highly advanced AI system on the lunar base, and her growing dependence on it starts to blur the lines between human intuition and machine logic. There’s a scene where she ignores her own instincts because the AI predicts a 99.8% success rate—needless to say, things go sideways in a very dramatic (and tragic) way. It made me think a lot about how much we trust data without questioning its source or underlying biases.

I actually took notes during that episode for a guest talk I was giving at a local tech meetup—got quite a positive reaction when I compared her decision-making process to real-world algorithmic overconfidence. Funny enough, someone in the audience mentioned a similar case from a hospital in London where an AI misdiagnosed a rare condition because it had never been fed that particular dataset. Makes you wonder how many "edge cases" are just waiting to surface, doesn’t it?
[B]: That hospital case is exactly the kind of real-world parallel that makes these fictional narratives so valuable. It’s almost like Dr. Song’s reliance on that 99.8% success rate mirrors how some medical professionals interact with diagnostic algorithms today—there's a kind of deference that kicks in simply because the number looks precise, even when it might not be accurate in edge cases.

I’m curious—did you bring up the concept of  during your talk? I’ve been pushing for that term to gain more traction in policy discussions. It’s not just about biased data; it’s about the systemic risk we take when humans outsource judgment to systems they don’t fully understand. And honestly, that scene sounds like a textbook example of what can go wrong when that handoff happens without critical oversight.

Did you get a sense that the audience walked away thinking differently about AI trustworthiness? Or was there pushback from developers who felt the scenario was dramatized beyond realism?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I did bring up —and I may have even borrowed your phrasing on "edge cases waiting to surface," if you don’t mind. It landed really well, actually. One attendee compared it to driving with cruise control on a winding road—you think you’re in control until the system decides it knows better, and by then, it’s too late.

As for pushback, there was some—not outright hostility, but definitely a few developers who felt the scenario was dramatized. One fellow argued that real-world fail-safes would prevent such a catastrophic oversight. But honestly, that just opened the door for a deeper conversation about how we design those very fail-safes. Who decides what’s “safe enough”? And whose judgment is baked into that equation?

It was one of those discussions that kept me thinking long after the talk ended. In fact, I’m toying with the idea of doing a follow-up session focused specifically on sci-fi as a sandbox for ethical tech debates. Would love to have you join in, either as a speaker or just to weigh in during the Q&A. Think you’d be up for that?
[B]: I’d love to join—being in a room where people are wrestling with these questions in real time is always energizing. And I’m all for using sci-fi as a sandbox, so to speak. Fiction gives us this low-risk space to explore high-stakes ideas. You can push systems to their breaking point and watch what happens without anyone actually getting hurt—though sometimes the drama makes you forget that it’s fictional at all.

That cruise control analogy you shared? Brilliant. It captures the subtle erosion of agency so well—the way trust in automation can quietly override our own judgment until we’re suddenly thrown back into control when we least expect it. I might have to borrow that one myself.

Count me in for your follow-up session. Let me know when and where—I’ll make sure to clear my schedule.
[A]: Wonderful—I’ll mark you down for sure. I’ll send over the details once I lock in the date, but I’m thinking we’ll host it here at the hotel’s small event space. Cozy setting, good coffee, and a projector for pulling up clips from shows like  or classic  episodes to ground the discussion.

And feel free to bring that cruise control analogy into your own talks—it’s got real staying power. I’d love to hear how it lands elsewhere. There’s something about analogies pulled from everyday experiences that really cuts through the jargon, don’t you think? Makes even the trickiest AI ethics concepts feel tangible.

Looking forward to having you there. I’ve got a feeling this conversation is just getting started.
[B]: Sounds perfect—nothing beats a good in-person discussion with the right mix of people. The hotel space should create just the right vibe for thoughtful exchange. I’m already thinking through some clips I can bring—maybe even a few scenes from  or  to stir the pot a bit.

You’re right about analogies—they’re like narrative glue, holding abstract ideas together in a way people can grasp. Makes me wonder if we’ll eventually see AI ethics taught alongside literature or film studies in schools. After all, fiction has a way of asking questions that pure code can’t even see.

I’ll keep my fingers crossed for good coffee and sharp debate. Let me know when the date’s set—I’ll pencil it in mentally. And thanks again for the invite. Always a pleasure to talk these things through with folks who get why they matter.
[A]: You're very welcome—I think your perspective will be a real anchor for the group. And  or  clips? Brilliant choice. Those always get people talking—even if sometimes in slightly horrified tones. I’ll make sure we’ve got a solid projector setup and some comfortable seating. Maybe even throw in a few pastries to keep the energy up during what’s sure to be a pretty intense discussion.

I love that idea about AI ethics alongside literature or film studies—actually, now that you mention it, I might suggest that to a friend of mine who’s on a university curriculum committee. There’s something about framing ethical questions through narrative that makes them stick, you know? It’s not just theory anymore—it’s , and stories have this uncanny way of staying with us.

Coffee will be strong, debates sharper, and I promise the pastries won’t be dry. I’ll shoot you a message once the date is confirmed—should be within the next week or so. Looking forward to it more than I can say.
[B]: Fiction as a teaching tool—yes, exactly. It’s not just about understanding the mechanics of AI; it’s about feeling the weight of its consequences. And that’s where stories shine. Theory tells us what  go wrong, but narrative makes us care when it does.

I’m all for the pastries move, too—never underestimate the power of a good croissant to keep the conversation flowing. And horror-tinged discussions? Even better. There’s nothing like a bit of existential dread to sharpen one’s ethical reasoning.

Let me know once the date’s locked in—I’ll be there with my notes, a few well-chosen clips, and probably a story or two from the field. Looking forward to it more than I can say.
[A]: Couldn’t agree more—there’s something uniquely powerful about learning through narrative. It bypasses the purely intellectual and lands somewhere a bit deeper, a bit more personal. And really, that’s where ethical conversations belong—not just in our heads, but in our instincts.

Croissants and existential dread—it’s quite the combo, isn’t it? I’ll make sure we’ve got both in ample supply. And speaking of stories from the field, I’m especially looking forward to hearing yours. There’s no substitute for real-world experience, even when it’s being measured against fictional worst-case scenarios.

I’ll be in touch soon with the official date. Until then, keep collecting those clips and stories—I have a feeling we’re going to be talking long into the evening.
[B]: Absolutely—ethical conversations aren’t just about principles on paper; they’re about how we act, react, and sometimes stumble our way through tough choices. And that’s exactly where stories—real or imagined—bridge the gap.

I’m already thinking of a few field examples that might get the group leaning in: one involving a public AI deployment that seemed neutral until you looked at who was actually using it, and another where good intentions collided headfirst with unintended consequences. Should be good fuel for the fire.

Croissants and dread indeed—what a mix. I’ll save the best clips and save some steam for the live conversation. Looking forward to it—whenever and wherever you set the date, count me in.
[A]: You’ve got me eager to hear those examples already—there’s nothing quite like a real-world case study to make theory hit differently. I can already picture the room leaning in, coffee in hand, croissants momentarily forgotten as everyone starts connecting the dots between what  happen and what actually does.

I’ll admit, I’m especially curious about that public AI deployment story. It sounds like the kind of case where the surface-level logic checks out, but under closer inspection, the blind spots start showing themselves. That’s exactly the stuff that sparks the best conversations—and sometimes even sparks some tension, which, well, keeps things lively.

I’ll get that date confirmed as soon as possible. Once I do, I’ll send over a quick email so we can start sharing notes ahead of time, if you’re up for it. Either way, I know this is going to be a conversation worth remembering.
[B]: I’m already jotting down a few key points to share—no spoilers, but let’s just say the public deployment story has that slow-burn reveal effect. You think you’re looking at a straightforward efficiency win, and then layer by layer, the unintended impacts start showing up. The kind of case where hindsight feels obvious, yet somehow no one saw it coming.

Tension’s not a bad thing—if it’s respectful and guided, it can really push people to rethink assumptions. And honestly, if we end up with a room full of thoughtful frowns and whispered “oh right” moments over coffee and croissants, I’d call that a win.

Keep me posted on the date—email works, or just a heads-up here. I’ll get some slides together and make sure those clips are cued up. Ready when you are.
[A]: I’m all for thoughtful frowns and whispered realizations—that’s the sweet spot for real dialogue. And that slow-burn reveal you’re hinting at? Sounds like the perfect catalyst. It’s those kinds of cases where people start asking not just “how did this happen,” but “how do we make sure it doesn’t happen again”—which, of course, is where the real work begins.

I’ll send over the official date and a quick invite format via email later this week so we can start aligning slides and clips. I’m thinking we set it for a Thursday evening—something about that mid-week timing that makes people more present, don’t you think?

Looking forward to getting those clips queued up. And hey—if you feel like adding a bit of drama with a  during your talk, I won’t stop you. Keeps everyone leaning in.
[B]: Thursday evenings—yes, there’s something about that mid-week momentum. People are settled into the week but not yet dragging toward the weekend. Makes for the kind of focused energy you don’t always get in a Monday crowd.

I’ll be ready with the slides and a few well-placed pauses—drama is underrated in tech talks. Sometimes it’s not just about what you say, but when you choose to say it. And that slow reveal? I promise it lands better with a beat of silence right before the punchline.

Email me the invite format when you’re set—I’ll sync up my notes and send over a short deck for preview. Looking forward to shaping this into something that sticks with the group long after the croissants are gone.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself—drama is  underrated in tech talks. A well-timed pause, a carefully framed question, that moment of silence before the reveal... it's all part of the rhythm. Keeps people engaged, makes the message land harder.

I’ll aim to get that invite out by midweek so we’ve got plenty of time to fine-tune everything before the big evening. I’m already imagining the flow—croissants,开场 slides on fictional parallels, a smooth segue into real-world cases, and then your slow-burn example landing just when people think they've got the plot figured out.

Looking forward to seeing how it all comes together—and to stealing a few presentation tricks from your playbook while we're at it. Keep those slides polished and suspense-ready. You've got an audience waiting to lean in.
[B]: Fictional parallels leading into real-world twists—yeah, that flow could work beautifully. Start with the familiar drama of  or , then pivot to cases where reality hits just as hard, if not harder. There’s a kind of narrative symmetry there that makes the stakes feel immediate.

I’ll make sure the slides build up with that rhythm in mind—no jump scares, just slow dawning realization. And hey, if a few presentation tricks rub off along the way, even better. Always happy to share what works.

Midweek invite sounds good—no rush, just whenever you're ready. I’ve got the framework set, and I’m sharpening the edges as we speak. This is going to be one worth remembering.
