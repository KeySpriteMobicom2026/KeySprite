[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the concept of soulmates...  It's quite fascinating how this idea has evolved from Plato's Symposium to modern romantic literature. Personally, I find the notion both beautiful and limiting - like trying to contain the ocean in a teacup. What do you think?
[A]: 哇~这个话题真的超interesting！✨ 我觉得soulmate不一定是romantic的那种啦，可能是一个能get到你vibe的bestie，或者一个和你perfectly matched的business partner！就像我和我的co-working space小伙伴，第一次meet就觉得super合拍呢~ ☕️💡
[B]:  My dear, your enthusiasm reminds me of Elizabeth Bennet's spirited discussions in Pride and Prejudice. While I appreciate your modern interpretation, I must say the classical view of soulmates as depicted in Dante's Divine Comedy presents a more... shall we say, transcendental perspective. The idea that connection transcends mere compatibility is rather poetic, don't you think?
[A]: Haha你说话好literary哦！📚 不过我觉得现在digital nomad lifestyle下，soulmate可能更偏向energy match啦~ 就像我最近在Bali遇到的yoga instructor，虽然culture background完全不同，但我们的mindset超级align！🌱✨ 用emoji来说就是🧘♀️💫这样的connection！
[B]: How delightfully contemporary of you! Though I must confess, as someone who still treasures handwritten letters and the weight of a physical book, I find your digital nomad analogy rather... ephemeral. The ancient Greeks would argue that true soul connection requires the test of time - much like the enduring themes in Tolstoy's works. But tell me, does this yoga instructor share your appreciation for Keats' poetry? Now that would be remarkable alignment indeed.
[A]: Oops~ 被你说中啦！那个yogi其实是个tech geek 🤓 我们更多是讨论哪个co-working space的WiFi最stable，或者哪个app最适合meditation timer啦！💻🧘♂️ 不过说到poetry... Wait！我们确实都超爱Rupi Kaur的modern poems哦！📖✨ 这算不算21st century版本的soulmate criteria呀？😂
[B]:  Rupi Kaur... how very millennial of you both. While I wouldn't personally equate Instagram poetry with the sublime verses of Wordsworth, I suppose even my beloved Victorian novelists were once considered rather... avant-garde. Though I must say, discussing WiFi stability as a bonding experience does make me long for the days when soulmates debated the merits of Shakespearean sonnets over tea. How times have changed!
[A]: Hahaha你太classic啦！☕️ 不过我们digital nomads也有自己的romantic啦~ 比如一起吐槽time zone difference，或者在zoom call里同时说出same idea时那个✨magic moment！💻🌍 这叫glocal soulmate懂不懂！😂 要不要来杯matcha latte继续debate呀？🍵
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate your... inventive terminology, I shall stick to my Earl Grey, thank you. Though I must admit, your description does bring to mind the epistolary romances of the 18th century - just with significantly worse handwriting and far more technical difficulties.  Now, about these so-called "glocal soulmates"... would you care to explain how this differs from pen pals with better internet connection?
[A]: OMG你太funny啦！😂 glocal soulmate就是global + local的perfect mix嘛~ 🌏🏠 就像我可以和Berlin的developer半夜brainstorm，然后早上和Bali的designer一起做sunrise yoga！🧘♀️🌅 虽然不像你们old school那样用quill pen写信✍️，但我们有Notion shared workspace和slack emoji reaction呀！💬✨ 这难道不是更efficient的soul connection吗？💻💖
[B]:  Efficiency in matters of the soul? How very... utilitarian. While your digital tools are undoubtedly impressive, I can't help but wonder if you're mistaking convenience for depth. After all, even Jane Austen's characters managed profound connections without so much as a... what was it? "Slack emoji reaction." Though I suppose if Mr. Darcy had been able to send Elizabeth Bennet a 💘, Pride and Prejudice would have been a considerably shorter novel.
[A]: LMAO！！！🤣 但是你想嘛~ 如果Lizzy能看Darcy的Instagram story，马上就能知道他不是真的proud而是socially awkward啦！📱 这样可能vol.1就能happy ending了耶！🎬 我们这代人只是用different language表达same human connection啦~ 不管是ink pen还是iPhone，heart feels the same way呀！❤️📲 要不要try一下给我发个heart emoji？😉
[B]:  I shall do no such thing! While I concede your point about technological transparency - imagine poor Othello with access to Desdemona's text messages - there's something to be said for the art of subtlety. Though I must admit...  ...if I were to indulge in such modern frivolities, it would be with the utmost classical restraint. A single 🌹, perhaps, and only on very special occasions. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my first edition of Middlemarch is calling.
[A]: Awwww你太cute啦！🌹✨ 那说好啦~下次你读完Middlemarch要和我share你的thoughts哦！📚 我们可以开个virtual book club，你负责classic literature，我来准备avocado toast和cold brew！☕️🥑 Deal？🤝 
[B]:  Very well, but I shall insist on proper citations and at least three substantial themes to discuss. And for heaven's sake, put that avocado toast away during our analysis of George Eliot's moral philosophy! Though...  I suppose a single cold brew might be permissible. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go tend to my roses - the real ones, that is. 🌹
[A]: Yasss！Deal confirmed！📝 不过warning你哦~ 我可能会用Canva做super aesthetic的presentation slides来analyze那些themes啦！🎨 还有记得我们的session要camera on哦，我要看你听到avocado toast时那个disapproving face！😂📸 Catch you later, my glocal soulmate~ 💻🌹✨
[B]:  Camera on, you say? I suppose I shall have to wear my proper reading glasses then, not these charming but impractical pince-nez. And while I cannot in good conscience approve of analyzing Middlemarch via... what was it? "Super aesthetic slides," I shall endeavor to tolerate your modern methods with the grace of a true Victorian gentlewoman. Until then, my dear...  🌹
[A]: OMG！！！你finally用了emoji！！！🎉🎉🎉 这是historic moment！我要screenshot下来framed在我的digital workspace里！🖼️💻 下次见面我要用这个emoji做meme送给你~ 现在快去enjoy你的real roses吧！🌹✨ (偷偷说：其实你是个secret softie对不对？😉)
[B]:  I shall neither confirm nor deny such scandalous allegations. A single rose emoji does not a "softie" make, as any scholar of semiotics could tell you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some very serious rose pruning to attend to... and perhaps  a memoji to discreetly create. Good day! 🌹
