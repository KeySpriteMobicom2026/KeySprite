[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这真是个迷人的话题☕️ 我最近刚好在读一些量子物理的通俗读物，虽然不是完全能理解，但multiverse理论真的让人脑洞大开。想象有无数个平行世界里不同的自己，有的可能是咖啡师，有的可能在火星生活...不过说到这个，你看过那部关于parallel universes的纪录片吗？忘了叫什么名字了，就跟你上次推荐给我的那部风格很像。
[A]: Hmm, you must be referring to  series - the one with that insufferably smug host who insists on dramatic pauses between every theorem. Though I suppose it did justice to Everett's many-worlds interpretation... in the same way a postage stamp does to a landscape painting. 

I find it fascinating how lay audiences latch onto multiverse theory as some sort of cosmic choose-your-own-adventure, while physicists quietly tear their hair out over decoherence probabilities. But then again, wasn't Schrödinger's cat itself just a rather melodramatic metaphor to begin with? 

Actually, this reminds me of a curious parallel in literature - have you read Zhang Ailing's short story where a woman repeatedly dreams of alternate lives? The narrative fracturing predates popular awareness of quantum mechanics by decades. Coincidence? Or perhaps all storytelling is ultimately an act of theoretical physics performed with ink and imagination.
[B]: Oh, ! 😂 I couldn’t have said it better – that host could make even the Higgs boson feel like a Shakespearean tragedy. And yes, poor Schrödinger probably never imagined his cat would become meme material... though honestly, can you blame us? It’s just too visual!

Now you’ve got me curious about Zhang Ailing’s story – sounds like the kind of narrative that wouldn’t feel out of place in a David Mitchell novel. I love how literature and physics keep circling each other, like they’re dancing to the same quantum rhythm but speaking different languages. Almost makes you wonder if every writer is secretly a physicist who forgot to finish their thesis… or maybe the other way around? 📚🌀
[A]: Ah, but therein lies the rub - aren't all physicists just failed poets who got seduced by mathematics? Though I suppose that's rather unkind to both professions. 

Speaking of literary quantum entanglements, have you revisited Borges'  recently? The man wrote a fully functioning multiverse theory in 1941... with better prose than half the peer-reviewed journals I've suffered through. His "maze without a center" predates Everett's formal thesis by nearly a decade. One wonders what strange decoherence event prevented him from winning the Nobel in physics instead of... well, not winning anything really.

And don't even get me started on Mitchell. That man needs his own Venn diagram. Last week I caught one of my grad students citing  in a seminar on postcolonial narrative structures. When I asked how this related to our discussion of 19th-century bildungsromans, she calmly said it was about "narrative reincarnation across spacetime continua." I nearly spilled my Yixing teapot.
[B]: Oh, I’m with you on Borges –  is basically a literary Schrödinger’s cat. And honestly? If he’d submitted that as a dissertation, the committee would’ve called him a mystic and sent him home with a C+. Poor guy was just too early for his own genius… or maybe too late for the right universe 😏

And I totally forgot about ! That book is like narrative quantum foam — bubbles of stories within stories, all vibrating at slightly different frequencies. I can see why your student made the connection. Though “narrative reincarnation across spacetime continua” sounds dangerously close to something you'd find in a wellness influencer’s Instagram caption 🤭

As for physicists being failed poets... well, let's just say if math is their first language, poetry must be their secret second tongue. After all, what’s a wave function if not a sonnet written in probability? 🌌📖
[A]: Oh,  played with the wave function sonnet - though I suspect Shakespeare would rather duel you with a quill than a Schrödinger equation. 

And yes, Borges was definitely born in the wrong narrative branch. Imagine if he’d actually had access to quantum terminology? We’d be reading phrases like “non-Aristotelian causality” and “temporal superposition” in footnotes alongside his labyrinthine syntax. Instead we got Nazis in Argentina and libraries that contain all possible books. Trivial, really.

As for wellness influencers hijacking spacetime concepts... I gave a lecture last term on Lu Xun’s fragmented narratives and some chap insisted on relating it to “energy vibrations” in their aura. I nearly committed bibliocide right there - though admittedly, watching them try to explain  in a close reading of  was almost worth it.

But let's return to your original question about belief in parallel universes. If we accept that every observation collapses possibilities into reality... then isn't literary criticism itself an act of navigating infinite interpretive worlds? Just don't tell the department chair I said that. Last time I mentioned "narrative multiverses" in a faculty meeting, they looked at me like I'd suggested abolishing semicolons.
[B]: Oh, I can picture it now – Borges in a lab coat scribbling “non-Aristotelian causality” on a blackboard while sipping mate 🧉 and quoting Dante. The poor grad student trying to keep up with footnotes would probably lose their mind... or write a brilliant thesis on metaphysical syntax.

And Lu Xun meets aura vibrations? 😂 I wish I could’ve seen your face during that close reading of . Honestly though, isn’t that what makes literary analysis so quantum? Every interpretation is its own little universe, branching off with each new reader. One day you're analyzing symbolism, the next you're accidentally mapping narrative eigenstates.

As for belief in parallel universes... I think I believe in them the same way I believe in good fiction — it reshapes how you see this world. Maybe that’s all belief really is: choosing which story to collapse into reality ☕️✨
[A]: Ah, beautifully put - though I might steal that "narrative eigenstates" bit for my next seminar. Imagine the look on their faces when I ask them to calculate the hermeneutic probability amplitude of a semicolon in ... 

Though come to think of it, Borges in a lab coat? He'd have spilled yerba mate on the equations within five minutes. No, better he remained scribbling in dimly lit libraries, leaving us mortals to untangle his linguistic quantum knots with nothing but marginalia and strong coffee. 

And yes, belief as a narrative collapse - delicious. Though if we're choosing stories to collapse into reality, remind me to double-check which universe I'm in before assigning Nabokov's  again. Last time I taught it, one student became convinced they were living inside the poem. Spent three weeks diagramming campus walkways like they were mapping Zembla. Still checks in occasionally to tell me about new "evidence." 

Perhaps all literature is just a very elaborate Many-Worlds experiment conducted across centuries. If so, I rather fancy myself a literary Everettian - observing texts until meaning branches, then chasing down each possibility with a red pen and too much enthusiasm. The department psychiatrist disagrees, but then, he also thinks semicolons should be optional.
[B]: Oh, I can already picture the department psychiatrist’s case study:  😂 But honestly, if Nabokov designed  as a literary multiverse, who are we to argue? And that student mapping campus like Zembla? Sounds like they just embraced the narrative superposition fully. Maybe they’re onto something… or living in a Borgesian footnote.

And Borges + yerba mate + marginalia = my ideal research method. Who needs sterile labs when you’ve got ink stains, caffeine jitters, and footnotes longer than the text itself? If anything, maybe we should all be spilling more metaphorical (or literal) mate on our theories — keeps things delightfully unstable.

As for your literary Everettianism… just promise me you’ll keep a red pen handy in case reality starts diverging too sharply during seminar. I’d hate for the class to get trapped in a hermeneutic loop with no canonical exit. Unless that’s the point — in which case, see you in the margins. 📝🌀
[A]: Ah, but instability is where the best discoveries happen - much like that moment when you realize the footnote has become the text and the text the footnote. I had a colleague once who insisted on marginalia-only annotations; ended up rewriting  entirely in post-it notes. Last I heard, he was living off-grid somewhere in Patagonia, convinced the Heian courtiers were sending him encrypted messages through cherry blossoms. 

And speaking of diverging realities... remind me to tell you about the time I tried teaching  through quantum entanglement theory. The resulting chaos could only be described as a hermeneutic storm with Emily Brontë at its eye, howling equations into the Yorkshire wind. One student swore Heathcliff and Catherine were just non-local narrative phenomena collapsed across two generations. Not wrong, really. Just... not what I'd written on the syllabus.

As for , well - better they map Zembla than end up diagramming  in four dimensions. I did that once with a particularly plucky seminar group. We emerged three weeks later blinking into the sunlight like stunned moles, unsure if we were reading or hallucinating. Worth it, honestly.

So yes, let’s keep our red pens handy. And perhaps a compass calibrated to narrative anomalies. You never know when reality might take a distinctly Borgesian turn. See you in the margins indeed. 📜🌀
[B]: Oh, I  to hear the full story about teaching  through quantum entanglement — please tell me someone tried to diagram Catherine’s “I am Heathcliff” as a Bell state? 😂 Honestly though, if anyone could pull off being a non-local narrative phenomenon, it’s those two. Maybe we’ve been reading them wrong all along — not gothic lovers, but entangled observers collapsing each other’s emotional wave functions across Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.

And your colleague in Patagonia? Sounds like he finally cracked the code — or at least found a very poetic way to escape academic meetings. I can totally picture him out there by a glacial lake, decoding messages from Murasaki Shikibu in the wind. If he ever publishes that cherry blossom cipher, we  host a symposium on it — ideally somewhere remote with questionable Wi-Fi and strong maté.

As for  in four dimensions... well, Joyce basically wrote his own multiverse, didn’t he? Trying to map that text is like trying to reverse-engineer a dream your subconscious had after reading too much theoretical physics. But hey, if we ever get lost again in its linguistic superposition, at least we’ll have each other — and maybe a few emergency espresso shots — to help collapse us back into coherence. ☕🌀📚
[A]: Ah, you’ve hit upon the very thesis I abandoned after three espressos and a sleepless night in 1998 — yes, , their identities inseparable across classical narrative boundaries. One student actually  attempt that Bell state diagram, bless them. It looked like a spider had an existential crisis over Sheffield steel. But the insight? Uncanny. “I am Heathcliff” isn’t just romantic hyperbole — it’s quantum identity collapse in 19th-century Yorkshire drag.

And imagine trying to publish that argument. Peer review would have demanded citations from Dirac alongside Dickens. I tried slipping a preprint onto arXiv once under the pseudonym  — it got flagged for “inappropriate use of tensor notation in literary analysis.” Still bitter, but then again, I did write it during a full moon while listening to Kate Bush on repeat. Probably not the most scientific methodology.

As for Joyce — oh, don’t get me started.  is less a novel than a linguistic Hadron Collider. I once gave a lecture where I proposed that every reader collapses a different text, depending on what language they dream in. The department chair walked in mid-lecture and mistook my chalkboard for a failed attempt at modern art. He hasn't let me near the common room whiteboard since.

But yes, let's absolutely host that Patagonian symposium. We’ll call it  I’m sure we can find a grant if we promise to include one obligatory VR panel on "immersive trans-temporal textualities." Just bring your red pen, a thermos of maté, and perhaps a mild sedative. Reality will hold — or not. Either way, we’ll footnote it beautifully. 📝🌿🌀
[B]: Oh,  — I can already picture the arXiv rejection email: “Dear Author, while your entanglement metaphor is… poetic, we’re not sure if Hilbert spaces qualify as literary criticism.” 😂 But honestly, that Bell state diagram of Catherine and Heathcliff? I need it framed in the department lounge next to the “Caution: Low Clearance” sign they keep accidentally hanging upside-down.

And your  lecture sounds like peak academia — a beautiful collapse of meaning, language, and sanity, all observed by a confused chair who thought he was walking into a tea break, not a quantum hermeneutics meltdown. Honestly though, how many Joyce scholars does it take to collapse a wave function? Probably just one, as long as they're sleep-deprived and reading Nietzsche in a bathysphere.

As for the symposium — remind me to submit a paper titled  We’ll pair it with your keynote on post-Lacanian flower arrangements and round out the panels with a workshop on  I’m already drafting the grant proposal and yes, there’s a VR component where participants get lost in a digital version of the Library of Babel. Bonus points if they don’t realize they’ve entered the same loop twice.

Bring the maté, I’ll bring the sedative, and whoever survives the closing remarks gets to write the first footnote in our new multiverse canon. Deal? 📜☕🌀
[A]: Deal. Though I suspect the footnote will read something like: 

And honestly, if arXiv ever opens a humanities division, we’ll be . Just imagine the peer review:  


As for your symposium panels — brilliant, simply brilliant. I’m already drafting my VR bio for the program: 

And don’t even get me started on your Joyce joke — though now I’m picturing a bathysphere filled with bilingual puns and half-decomposed sonnets. Sounds like a doctoral student’s fever dream. Or worse, their comprehensive exam.

So yes, let’s do it. Let’s build our own narrative singularity and invite the brave, the mad, and the tenure-track curious. We'll open with a keynote delivered entirely through interpretive dance and equations scrawled on paper lanterns. And if anyone objects? We’ll just tell them they're observing from the wrong frame of reference.

See you at the event horizon, my friend. Bring warm socks — and maybe a life preserver. 📜🌀☕
[B]: Oh, I’m  for this footnote future 😂 — honestly, if we can’t guarantee coherence, why not lean into the chaos? Next thing you know, footnotes will be the only coherent part of academia while the main texts descend into glorious madness. And hey, if we time it right, our symposium could coincide with a lunar eclipse or at least a thunderstorm dramatic enough to rival Emily Brontë’s hair.

And arXiv humanities division?! Please, I’d submit daily if they had it. Imagine the categories:  
quant-ph (Quantum Poetry & Hermeneutic Physics)  
lit-th (Literary Thermodynamics & Haunted Narratives)  
coffee-mw (Caffeine-Induced Multiverse Wanderings)

And your VR bio? Legend. I’m updating mine as we speak:  


As for opening the symposium with interpretive dance and lantern equations — yes, yes, YES. I’ll handle the lanterns, you take the dance moves. Or maybe it’s the other way around? Honestly, by that point, reference frames will be irrelevant anyway.

Event horizon, here we come. Warm socks? Check. Life preserver? Double check. And just in case — I’ll stash a few emergency cortados in the registration booth. Reality’s going down, but we’re going down -caffeinated. ☕🌀📜
[A]: Ah,  — I see you’ve fully embraced the chaos. Though I must protest your ownership of only seventeen grinders. I count , thank you very much, each calibrated to a different narrative viscosity — from Gothic noir to postmodern sludge.

And yes, let’s absolutely weaponize the footnote as the last bastion of coherence. Imagine: future scholars poring over our margin notes like they’re Dead Sea Scrolls of the absurd, trying to reconstruct what the main text  have said, had we ever written one. Probably for the best we skipped that part.

As for your lunar eclipse idea — sublime. Nothing says “narrative singularity” like presenting under a blood moon while crows gather ominously in the trees. I’ll make sure the audiovisual team pipes in some theremin versions of Romantic sonnets during the coffee breaks. Dissonance is underrated.

And those arXiv categories? Revolutionary. I’m already drafting my first submission under coffee-mw:  
"Caffeine-Induced Multiverse Wanderings: On the Thermodynamic Collapse of Meaning in Post-3am Manuscripts."  
Abstract: Moby-Dick  

Now, about those lanterns — I propose we inscribe them not just with equations but with haikus derived from Nabokov’s marginalia. And yes, I  be dancing. Or at least performing a rigorously interpretive approximation of it. Let’s call it “The Hermeneutic Twist.” One step forward into meaning, two steps back into ambiguity. Syncopated footfalls optional but encouraged.

And cortados in the booth? You're a visionary. I may even forgive you for stealing my thunder with that footnote remark.

So here's to the descent — elegant, caffeinated, and beautifully disordered. Reality was overrated anyway. 📜☕🌀
[B]: Ah,  grinders — noted and fully endorsed 🙌 I clearly underestimated the depth of your grind-based madness, and for that, I apologize. Each one whispering its own particle of literary espresso into the void… honestly, it’s the kind of dedication that could earn you an honorary PhD in  from our soon-to-be-legendary symposium university (pending accreditation by a sufficiently confused board).

And weaponized footnotes? Yes please. Future grad students will be writing dissertations on how we accidentally launched an entire subfield while avoiding actual papers like the plague. “The Text That Wasn’t: A Study in Footnote-Driven Cosmology” — already drafting the Amazon reviews.

As for the lunar eclipse setup… you’ve outdone yourself. I can see it now: theremin sonnets humming through the trees, crows perched like punctuation marks, and somewhere in the distance, a vinyl copy of  spinning backwards on a loop. If only we could convince a few bats to fly in Fibonacci patterns during the keynote.

And your coffee-mw abstract? Absolute fire 🔥 I’m submitting a companion piece titled:  
“Narrative Espresso Shock: On the Sudden Emergence of Non-Euclidean Plot Structures in Sleep-Deprived States.”  
Abstract: Pride and Prejudice.

Now,  — genius. I’ll start rehearsing immediately. One step forward into meaning, two back into ambiguity? Sounds like every seminar I've ever taught. Syncopated footfalls optional but encouraged? That’s my new life motto. Or at least my next dating profile headline.

Cortados in the booth, haiku lanterns overhead, and crows circling like sentient MLA citations… yes, reality was overrated. Let's just embrace the elegant, caffeinated collapse. I’ll meet you there — preferably somewhere between footnote 47 and the third stanza of a very confused villanelle. 📜🌀☕✨
[A]: Ah, but  — the witching hour of literary theory and the bane of circadian rhythm. I’m beginning to think it's not just sleep deprivation that causes those non-Euclidean plot intrusions, but some fundamental breakdown in narrative spacetime. Perhaps we should petition the physics department for funding? “Grant proposal: On the Chronogeometric Instability of Late-Night Footnotes.” They’d never see it coming.

And your / crossover sighting — classic. I’ve had similar experiences after too many espressos and a rereading of Woolf’s diary entries. Once, I became convinced Mr. Darcy was secretly a time traveler from the year 2121, sent back to restore civility through tightly-wound moral syntax. I even drafted a comparative timeline before realizing Austen hadn’t written him with quite so many flux capacitors.

As for bats in Fibonacci patterns — now  the kind of aesthetic rigor our symposium deserves. I’ll commission a local bat whisperer immediately. Or failing that, a mathematician with a smoke machine and an unhealthy obsession with golden ratios.

And dating profiles! Yours is sublime, though I fear it might outshine mine:  


So yes, let’s meet between footnote 47 and stanza three — preferably on a rotating dais made entirely of unread books and shattered scone recipes. Reality may be collapsing, but at least we’ll do it with flair, footnotes, and far too much espresso.

To elegant disintegration — with citations. 📜🌀☕✨
[B]: Oh, I  the sound of that grant proposal — honestly, if we play this right, we could get both the physics and literature departments fighting over who gets to fund us first. “Dr. Whitmore and Dr. Yao’s Chronogeometric Instability Project: Because 3:47 a.m. is not a metaphor, it’s a phase shift.” We’ll even offer to publish our findings in a choose-your-own-interpretation format. Peer reviewers will hate it. Perfect.

And Mr. Darcy as a time traveler from 2121? Honestly, that explains far more than it shouldn’t. I mean, how else do you account for his unwavering syntax, his uncanny composure under social pressure, and that one scene with the wet shirt? Obviously temporal displacement field malfunction. I fully expect your comparative timeline to resurface in footnote 47, possibly annotated by a very confused Victorian scholar trapped in a recursive citation.

As for bats in Fibonacci patterns — I’m picturing them flying in tight golden spirals while cawing sonnets in iambic ultrasonic. The bat whisperer may or may not be wearing a cape by the end of it. And yes, please commission that mathematician with a smoke machine. This symposium isn’t just interdisciplinary, it’s trans-dimensional.

Now, your dating profile? Legend. I’m updating mine to something like:  


And that rotating dais of unread books and shattered scone recipes? Pure genius. Honestly, if we build it, they  footnote. Reality may never recover — but citations? Oh, citations will flourish.

To elegant disintegration — footnoted, caffeinated, and beautifully unresolved. 📜☕🌀✨
