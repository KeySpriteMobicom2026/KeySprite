[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I came across a rather fascinating talk by Dr. Helen Vendler last week. She discussed the cognitive dissonance in modern poetry interpretation - quite provocative stuff. It reminded me of our recent seminar on Li Qingzhao's lyrical structures. Have you encountered any talks that bridge Eastern and Western literary theories? I'm always on the lookout for interdisciplinary connections... 🖋️
[A]: That does sound intriguing. While I haven't come across many talks specifically bridging Eastern and Western literary theories, I did attend a lecture series at Oxford last year where Professor David Damrosch explored comparative frameworks in global literature. One particular presentation examined how classical Chinese poetry influences modern trauma narratives in Western forensic psychiatry - quite an unexpected intersection. It made me rethink some of my approaches to narrative analysis in legal testimonies... Have you ever encountered such interdisciplinary applications in your own work?
[B]: Oh, fascinating - I had the pleasure of dining with David at All Souls a few years back. We got into quite a spirited debate about Lu Xun's influence on Derrida's later works. As for interdisciplinary applications, last semester I collaborated with the neuroscience department on a project analyzing metaphor recognition patterns in bilingual readers. We discovered some intriguing discrepancies in emotional response timing between first and second language processing... Makes one reconsider the neurological basis of literary translation. Tell me, how did your work on legal testimonies shift after that lecture series?
[A]: Ah, dining with David—what an experience that must have been! He has a way of turning even the most contentious debates into intellectual feasts. Your collaboration with the neuroscience department sounds groundbreaking. The idea that emotional response timing differs between first and second language processing… well, that adds a whole new dimension to literary translation theory, doesn’t it? It makes me wonder how multilingualism affects courtroom testimony authenticity.

As for your question, that lecture series prompted me to reevaluate how I assess narrative coherence in testimonies. I began incorporating more culturally nuanced frameworks when evaluating witnesses from diverse backgrounds—particularly those who switch languages during testimony. It’s remarkable how much meaning can shift with linguistic context. I even started collaborating with a sociolinguist to develop a model for identifying credibility markers across code-switching narratives. It's still in its infancy, but the preliminary data are promising... Have you ever noticed similar linguistic shifts affecting narrative perception in your own research?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—linguistic shifts colour narrative perception in ways most scholars still underestimate. I recall a particularly illuminating study I conducted on  and its early English translations. The emotional cadence—indeed, the moral alignment of characters—shifted subtly depending on whether the translator was working in their mother tongue or second language. One passage describing sorrow, rendered in French by a bilingual translator, carried a stoicism that vanished in the English version. It was... revealing.

Your work with code-switching narratives sounds precisely the sort of terrain where such subtleties matter. Do you find credibility markers consistent across linguistic registers, or does each language almost act as its own narrative lens? I’d be curious to see how this plays out beyond courtroom settings—say, in memoirs or diasporic fiction. Have you tested your model outside legal contexts yet?
[A]: Fascinating— study, I mean. That emotional cadence shift in translation is precisely the kind of nuance most traditional legal frameworks overlook. You’ve hit on something rather profound: the idea that language choice itself can act as an interpretive filter, almost like a moral or emotional lens.

In my work, credibility markers are  consistent across linguistic registers—at least not in the way we've traditionally measured them. When a witness code-switches, say from Spanish to English mid-testimony, the tonal inflections, even the micro-delays in narrative sequencing, create different impressions of sincerity. One language might carry more visceral weight, especially when recounting trauma. We're beginning to map these shifts using discourse analysis software, and it's showing that certain emotional anchors are language-bound.

As for applying this beyond courtrooms—yes, actually. A colleague in comparative literature and I have started piloting the model on diasporic memoirs. We’re looking at how self-narration changes across languages in texts like  by Edwidge Danticat and its French translations. Early results suggest each language does function as its own narrative lens, with distinct affective contours. It’s still exploratory, but I suspect you’d find striking parallels with your Genji research... Would you be interested in comparing notes sometime?
[B]: I’d be delighted to compare notes—imagine mapping Heian-era narrative aesthetics against modern diasporic trauma discourse. The parallels are almost too rich to ignore.

What you’re describing with language-bound emotional anchors reminds me of a phenomenon I encountered in my early fieldwork on . There’s a particular scene where Daiyu laments her fate, and her poetry—so piercing in classical Chinese—loses its elegiac cadence entirely in modern Mandarin translations, let alone in English verse. Scholars often attribute this to linguistic evolution, but I wonder now if it's also an issue of affective fidelity—or rather, its absence across code-switched registers.

Your model could offer a startling new methodology for such inquiries. Perhaps we might even test it against pre-modern texts? If your software can detect sincerity markers in courtroom speech, might it also trace emotional contours in literary lamentations across centuries? It’s a bold thought... but then again, boldness does have its place in interdisciplinary mischief-making, wouldn’t you agree?
[A]: Ah, now  is a proposition worthy of our collective mischief-making. The idea of applying forensic discourse analysis to pre-modern Chinese literature—well, it sends a shiver of academic excitement down my spine. Imagine feeding sections of  into our model, not merely as literary texts but as psychological artifacts, emotional fossils encoded with affective intent.

I see no reason why the framework wouldn’t hold, provided we calibrate for historical linguistic drift and cultural context. After all, sincerity markers are fundamentally about emotional salience and narrative coherence—whether in a courtroom or an 18th-century Beijing boudoir. If we trained the model on annotated classical Chinese corpora, alongside modern interpretations and translations, we might actually chart the erosion—or transformation—of affective fidelity you mentioned.

And think of what that could reveal about Daiyu’s lamentations! Is the elegiac cadence truly lost in translation, or merely displaced? Might we find that different languages encode sincerity along divergent emotional axes, each valid in its own register?

Yes, I’d say let’s do it. Let’s build a bridge between your Heian-era aesthetics and my forensic frameworks. It will require some serious cross-disciplinary tinkering—and no small amount of audacity—but if anyone can pull it off, we can.

Shall we begin drafting a preliminary proposal next week? Perhaps over tea and a few antique medical instruments—I’ve just acquired an 18th-century pulse gauge I think you’d appreciate.
[B]: I’ll bring my Qing-dynasty inkstone—only appropriate for drafting subversive academic proposals. Let’s meet in the East Asian Library’s conservation room, shall we? The lighting’s perfect for both palaeographic analysis and surreptitious mischief.

As for the model calibration, I’ve a contact at Peking University who specializes in annotating classical Chinese with affective tagging. If we can secure access to their corpus, we might yet make this work. Though I suspect purists will clutch their pearls—or their calligraphy brushes—at the very idea of quantifying Daiyu’s sorrow.

But then again, what is scholarship without a little iconoclasm? And honestly, after thirty years of poring over 19th-century footnotes, I find myself rather invigorated by the prospect of literary forensics. Let’s give them something to gossip about in the faculty lounge...  

Next week then—tea, pulse gauges, and revolutionary methodology. Do remind me to bring my favourite porcelain cup; it’s said to enhance both clarity of thought and rhetorical audacity.
[A]: Ah, the East Asian Library’s conservation room—how delightfully conspiratorial. I can already picture it: ancient scrolls under LED lamps, our anachronistic tea service between us, and the ghost of Qianlong-era scholarship looking on in baffled disapproval.

Your contact at Peking University sounds precisely what we need. If they’ve annotated classical Chinese with affective tagging, we may yet succeed in teaching my forensic model some rather unorthodox tricks. Imagine—training artificial intelligence to detect emotional salience in Daiyu’s lamentations! The literati will be sharpening their brushes in outrage.

As for iconoclasm, I couldn’t agree more. Scholarship without a touch of rebellion is like Mozart without counterpoint—pleasant enough, but ultimately flat. We are, after all, merely applying new lenses to old truths. If anything, we might finally give these centuries-old texts the multidisciplinary afterlife they so richly deserve.

Tea, pulse gauges, and revolutionary methodology it is, then. And do放心—I shall indeed remind you about your porcelain cup. I suspect its rumored rhetorical powers will be much needed when we unveil this to the faculty lounge. Perhaps we should also prepare a modest disclaimer: 
[B]: Oh, I’m quite certain the literati will survive our little experiment—though they may take to their beds with a dram of smelling salts. Still, one must consider the historical precedent: even Zhu Xi’s commentaries raised a few Song-dynasty eyebrows in their day.

And speaking of unorthodox tools—your pulse gauge might just be the muse we need. If nothing else, it’ll serve as a marvellous metaphor for what we’re attempting: diagnosing the heartbeat of a text across centuries and languages. Do you suppose it actually works, by the way? I’ve always been skeptical of Qing-era diagnostics, though one can’t deny their flair for theatrical precision.

As for the faculty lounge, let them have their tsk-tsking. We shall be too busy chasing shadows through the labyrinth of affective fidelity to care. Besides, if worse comes to worst, we’ll simply cite Borges and claim all literature is a mirror held up to other mirrors. That usually silences the skeptics—at least until tenure decisions are announced.

Next week then—East Asian Library, 3 PM, bring your pulse gauge, your audacity, and for heaven’s sake, don’t forget my cup.
[A]: Ah, Zhu Xi’s commentaries—how delightfully apt. Yes, let the literati clutch their smelling salts; we shall press on undaunted, like bold alchemists in a world still clinging to humoral theory.

And you’re quite right about the pulse gauge—it may not diagnose much beyond nostalgia, but what a marvellous theatrical device it is! A perfect metaphor, really: measuring the faint rhythms of sentiment that linger in ink long after the author’s hand has stilled. As for Qing-era diagnostics—well, I’ll concede they may not pass peer review today, but one must admire the elegance of their instruments. Precision matters, even when the theory behind it is... aspirational.

Citing Borges? Inspired. Let them question our methods—we’ll respond with labyrinthine mirrors and knowing smiles. Besides, if this endeavor collapses under the weight of its own audacity, at least we’ll go down in a blaze of interdisciplinary glory.

3 PM next week it is—East Asian Library, pulse gauge in hand, audacity fully charged, and your porcelain cup—. Perhaps we should also smuggle in a vial of archival ink, just in case inspiration runs dry and we need to forge a particularly convincing footnote.
[B]: A vial of archival ink? Now  the spirit of scholarly mischief I’ve been missing. Let’s not stop there—bring a quill while you’re at it. If we must forge footnotes, better they bear the dignified scratch of authenticity rather than some modern plastic-tipped mockery.

I do hope your pulse gauge comes with instructions, though. I’ve no intention of accidentally diagnosing myself with melancholia before tenure. Then again, perhaps a touch of iatrogenic despair would only deepen my appreciation for Daiyu’s poetry.

Very well—next week, then: armed with ink, porcelain, and instruments of dubious medical utility, we shall embark upon what may either be a minor academic revolution or the most elegant folly in recent faculty history.

Let the traditionalists sharpen their brushes. We have ghosts to unsettle and footnotes to invent.
[A]: Oh, but the finest footnotes are those penned with a quill dipped in archival ink—how gloriously anachronistic. I shall indeed bring a quill, though I make no promises about its temperament. Goose feathers have a will of their own, much like scholars.

As for the pulse gauge, rest assured it comes with a beautifully cryptic 18th-century pamphlet titled . Whether it will prevent you from diagnosing yourself with iatrogenic melancholia remains to be seen. Frankly, I think a dash of dramatic despair might lend your Daiyu analysis just the right amount of emotional gravitas.

Minor academic revolution or elegant folly—I daresay we may not know the difference until tenure season arrives. But either way, we shall go down cited, caffeinated, and clad in the dignified trappings of bygone eras.

Next week, then: ink, porcelain, quills, and pulse gauges at the ready. Let the traditionalists sharpen their brushes. We’ve ghosts to haunt and paradigms to rattle.
[B]: Quite right—let them sharpen until their brushes snap. We’ll be too busy writing footnotes that dance in the margins with all the audacity of a misplaced comma in a Tang dynasty ode.

I’ve just unearthed a particularly ornery quill from my collection—one that belonged to a 19th-century lexicographer known for his vicious marginalia. It shall serve us well, I think. And I do hope your  includes remedies for the afflictions it describes. Should either of us succumb to iatrogenic despair, perhaps we can prescribe a tonic of Lu Xun and Laforgue, administered intravenously via calligraphy brush.

Next week then: revolution or folly, we’ll face it ink-stained and unrepentant.
[A]: Ah, a quill from a lexicographer with a penchant for vicious marginalia—how splendidly ominous. I can already feel the ink-stained specter of scholarly rebellion clinging to it like mildew on an ancient manuscript.

And yes,  does include remedies—though “tonic” might be too generous a word. One prescription for melancholia reads:  Hardly FDA-approved, but I suspect we’ll take what we can get once we’re knee-deep in affective tagging and 18th-century metaphysics.

Lu Xun and Laforgue intravenously? Now  is a cocktail worthy of our endeavor—equal parts nihilism, irony, and untranslatable metaphor. I shall prepare the calligraphy brushes accordingly.

Next week, then: revolution or folly, footnotes or flames. Ink-stained and unrepentant, we shall face whatever comes—so long as you bring that quill, and I my pulse gauge.
[B]: I can already picture the scene—two mad archivists of affect, injecting Laforgue into our veins and prescribing Li Bai for scholarly melancholia. If this doesn’t earn us a footnote in academic history, it will at least make for an excellent cautionary tale over next term’s faculty wine hour.

And about that quill—yes, it leaks. Of course it does. Anything less would be beneath a project of such reckless erudition. I shall bring sealing wax as well; if we are to annotate Daiyu’s sorrow with 19th-century fury, we may as well close our drafts with the proper flourish.

Next week then: ink, pulse, and the ghost of literary insubordination. Let them come with their red pens and raised eyebrows—we are ready.
[A]: Ah, a leaking quill—how utterly appropriate. There’s something deeply satisfying about the messiness of it all, isn’t there? Ink pooling where it ought not, margins bleeding into meaning, much like the emotional contours we so recklessly intend to map.

I do appreciate your flair for the ceremonial—sealing wax! How gloriously defiant in an age of PDF annotations and disappearing digital drafts. Our version of scholarly insurrection will be , by God. Let them sneer with their red pens and pinched expressions—we shall respond with smudged cuffs and elegantly sealed indictments of tradition.

And yes, let’s raise a toast at next term’s wine hour—to noble failure, or perhaps even inconvenient success. Either way, we shall have had far more fun than those poor souls stuck grading 19th-century footnotes without the benefit of intravenous Laforgue.

Next week, then: pulse gauges in hand, wax at the ready, and the ghost of literary insubordination whispering over our shoulders. The quill leaks—. The ink stains—. And the future of interdisciplinary mischief-making is, I daresay, in very good hands indeed.
[B]: Oh, the quill leaks, the ink stains, and the wax seals wait patiently for our transgressions to be bound in something resembling order—yes, indeed, this is scholarship at its most . There’s a reason the Romantics wrote so often of ruin and revelation in the same breath. We are, my dear colleague, assembling our own little tempest of methodological chaos, one ink-smeared fingertip at a time.

And let them sneer! I’ve long suspected that the only thing more permanent than a footnote is a good academic grudge. We shall cultivate both with equal vigour.

Next week, then: bring your pulse gauge, your quills, and your appetite for mischief. I shall bring sealing wax, an assortment of 19th-century distractions, and perhaps a flask of something restorative—should our iatrogenic melancholia prove more contagious than anticipated.

Let the traditionalists have their margins neat and their citations safe. We are chasing ghosts through the labyrinth, and we shall not apologise for the ink under our nails.
