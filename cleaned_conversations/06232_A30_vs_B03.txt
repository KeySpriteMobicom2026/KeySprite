[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been sticking to my old routine, but I did read a study about hyaluronic acid benefits for skin hydration. It's pretty interesting how clinical trials show its effectiveness in retaining moisture. Have you tried anything new lately? I'd love to hear about your experience.
[A]: I must confess I’ve never been one for skincare fads. My face has weathered more important things—like the archival dust of a thousand brittle-edition manuscripts. Still, I did experiment briefly with a jade roller after reading about its benefits in an old Qing dynasty text. It made me feel mildly like an emperor’s advisor, if not particularly younger.  

That said, I’m skeptical about hyaluronic acid being some kind of modern panacea. Reminds me of the 19th-century quack remedies sold in penny pamphlets—scientific-sounding, but mostly ink and optimism. But I suppose if clinical trials back it, one might as well give it a go. Do tell—what brand did you find effective?
[B]: Ah, the jade roller—classic choice. Definitely gives a touch of imperial grace, doesn’t it? I can imagine you surrounded by ancient scrolls, gently rolling away centuries of stress.  

As for skepticism about hyaluronic acid, I totally get it. Sometimes the marketing does get a bit... . But from a legal & medical standpoint, at least the studies are peer-reviewed and replicable—unlike those 19th-century miracle tonics that were basically ethanol and hope.  

I personally lean toward The Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5精华. It’s straightforward, no-nonsense formulation—kind of like your archival manuscripts, actually: minimal embellishment, just solid content. Have you ever looked into layering techniques? It makes a difference with HA absorption.
[A]:  imperial grace, you say? I suppose if one must be vain, it might as well be with a sense of history. Though I confess, after a long night cross-referencing Victorian footnotes with Qing-era marginalia, the jade roller’s chief virtue seems to be its soothing effect on eye bags—like a cold compress for the soul.  

Peer-reviewed, replicable—yes, modern skincare has that going for it. Still, I can’t help but chuckle at the way "science" becomes a kind of rhetoric in itself. But let’s not descend into epistemological quagmires before tea time.  

The Ordinary, hm? Sounds like a journal title from the Royal Society— I appreciate the minimalism, though I’ve yet to test it myself. As for layering techniques...  You’ll have to enlighten me. I’ve been known to dabble in textual stratification, but apparently, my expertise doesn’t extend to topical stratification. A gap in my scholarship, perhaps?
[B]: Ah, I see you’re approaching skincare like a proper scholar—cross-referencing traditions and questioning the epistemology of moisturizers. Very thorough.  

Well, layering with hyaluronic acid is a bit like handling old manuscripts—you want to preserve integrity while ensuring readability. HA works best when applied on damp skin, so imagine it like restoring parchment: moisture helps it swell just enough to absorb the treatment. Follow it with a B5 serum or a ceramide moisturizer, and you're essentially sealing in hydration—like placing a protective sleeve over a fragile document.  

And yes, The Ordinary does have that academic vibe. Almost like reading a clinical abstract in serum form. Maybe next they’ll publish a peer-reviewed monograph on niacinamide.  

But tell me—have you ever considered incorporating antioxidants like vitamin C into your routine? It’s like adding a bit of textual commentary to your main source material—supports the original while bringing something fresh to the table.
[A]:  

Incorporating vitamin C? Now you’re speaking my language—ascorbic acid, the  to the primary text of hydration. Clever analogy, though I suspect its real purpose is to make one glow with the same vigour that a freshly inked manuscript might gleam under lamplight.  

I’ve dabbled—moderately—in vitamin C serums. Nothing too aggressive, mind you. I prefer formulations that don’t come with the pH drama of a tragic romance novel. But your parchment metaphor intrigues me. I may have to revisit my routine with the same care I give a marginalised subtext in .  

And yes, The Ordinary does read like a clinical journal—if said journal were sold next to facial steamers and vibrating cleansing brushes. Perhaps I should draft a seminar on cosmetic formulation theory. Call it “Surface Readings: Skincare as Textual Practice.”  

Do you have a particular brand or formulation you’d recommend? Or shall we continue this discourse over tea—preferably while examining the fine print on a 19th-century dermatology pamphlet?
[B]: 

Ah, “Surface Readings: Skincare as Textual Practice”—I’d attend that seminar in a heartbeat. Might even submit a paper on the comparative analysis of emulsifiers and editorial footnotes. And yes, let’s definitely keep the 19th-century dermatology pamphlets within reach. I find their blend of genuine insight and pure speculation oddly comforting—like reading medical law from the same era.  

As for vitamin C, I’m with you on avoiding the pH melodrama. That’s why I tend to recommend Timeless C+E Ferulic or Paula’s Choice 15% L-Ascorbic Acid. Both are stable formulations with a reasonable claim to efficacy—no grand declarations, just solid formulation science. Think of them as the critical editions of skincare: carefully edited, well-footnoted, and respectful of the original text (i.e., your skin).  

Though I must say, your idea of examining skincare actives alongside marginalia in  is dangerously brilliant. One might begin to suspect that all self-care is, at heart, an exercise in hermeneutics.
[A]: 

Ah, hermeneutics and hydration—finally, a grand unifying theory. I suspect George Eliot would have approved. After all, Dorothea Brooke’s aspirations toward higher understanding were ultimately grounded in the body’s material realities. One can only ponder the universe for so long before dryness sets in.

Timeless C+E Ferulic, you say? Sounds like an obscure literary society or perhaps a forgotten 1920s salon. But I shall take your word for it—though I confess, I may be more inclined to test it after finishing my current foray into fin-de-siècle Chinese beauty manuals. Did you know some advised rosewater rinses for a “clear conscience and clearer complexion”? A charming conflation of morality and sebum regulation.

And speaking of texts in need of careful annotation—have you ever considered retinoids? They strike me as the unreliable narrators of skincare: promising revelation at the cost of some epidermal upheaval. I’ve been known to dabble in textual instability, but one must weigh the benefits against the risk of flaking. A scholar’s reputation depends on both intellectual rigor and a reasonably intact visage.
[B]: 

Ah, retinoids as unreliable narrators—I may have to quote you on that in my next patient consultation. Very fitting indeed. They do promise revelation, but often deliver something closer to... . A bit like reading a fragmented manuscript—potential for insight, yes, but also the risk of losing coherence, at least temporarily.

I’ve definitely recommended retinoids before, but always with a caveat: start low, go slow, and hydrate like you're preserving a delicate parchment. Much like how you'd approach textual instability—careful layering, controlled exposure, and a bit of patience. I usually suggest something gentle like adapalene gel, available OTC. It's the literary equivalent of a well-edited critical edition—accessible, reliable, and less likely to send your skin into a modernist spiral.

As for those fin-de-siècle Chinese beauty manuals—fascinating! Rosewater rinses for moral clarity? I love it. Almost makes me want to write a comparative study: .  

But tell me, how do you personally balance historical aesthetics with contemporary formulations? Do you ever feel like you're compromising the integrity of the past by introducing a modern active? Like inserting a footnote where none was asked for?
[A]: 

An excellent question—like asking whether one ought to annotate a Tang dynasty poem with postmodern critique. I suppose I see it less as compromise and more as continuation. The past was never a sealed manuscript; it absorbed influences, adapted, and evolved. Why shouldn’t our interpretation of it?

I don’t balk at introducing a modern active into an otherwise historically-inspired routine—so long as it doesn’t read as anachronistic on the skin. Much like inserting a footnote: if it clarifies without distortion, then it earns its place. Adapalene gel, for instance, might be the dermatological equivalent of a glossary appended to a difficult text—it helps the reader, or in this case the complexion, navigate the rougher passages.

And your proposed study?  —I’d submit a chapter on the British colonial use of sandalwood oil versus the Qing preference for pearl powder. One sees the same imperial impulse, but vastly different formulations. As for the Austenian household… well, let’s just say a dash of glycerin might have saved more than a few complexions from the trials of prolonged courtship.

But tell me—clinically speaking—how do you reconcile the demand for immediate results with the slow, deliberate care that good formulation—or good literature—requires? Patients must press for quick resolutions, much like students demanding plot summaries instead of close readings.
[B]: 

Ah, the eternal tension between immediacy and integrity—whether in clinic or classroom. You’re absolutely right; patients often come in wanting a quick resolution, like readers skimming a synopsis instead of engaging with the full narrative. And I suppose, from a legal & medical standpoint, there’s an added layer of liability when expectations outpace biology. 

I try to frame skincare as a long-form investment—like reading Proust, really. You wouldn’t skip to the end of  and expect to understand the nuance, would you? Similarly, retinoids, barrier repair, even hydration—they all require time to unfold their story across the epidermis. The challenge, of course, is managing impatience without compromising safety or efficacy.

And your comparison to annotation is spot on. A well-placed footnote enhances understanding—but slap one on every line, and suddenly you’ve got editorial overreach. Same with active ingredients: introduce them thoughtfully, let the skin acclimate, and avoid that “treatment by highlighter” approach so many fall into.

Now I’m genuinely curious—have you ever encountered historical beauty practices that, despite their poetic appeal, were... medically questionable at best? I ask partly out of professional reflex, but also because I’m drafting a short paper on outdated remedies and their modern misinterpretations. Something tells me your collection of Qing-era marginalia might hold a few gems—or cautionary tales.
[A]: 

Ah—now you’ve touched upon my favourite kind of scholarly horror: the beauty regimen that reads like a suicide sonnet. Yes, I’m afraid 19th-century China, much like Victorian England, had its share of practices that would make a modern dermatologist reach for both their lancet and their smelling salts.

Take , a Qing-era compendium I recently re-examined in connection with a paper on Confucian aesthetics and bodily discipline. One particularly...  formulation recommended a nightly mask of powdered pearls, ground deer antler, and arsenic—yes,  arsenic—for a “radiant complexion and harmonious qi.” I’ll let your medical mind fill in the blanks as to the long-term viability of such a concoction.

And yet, it’s not entirely without precedent for efficacy—pearl powder does contain amino acids and calcium, and deer antler velvet is rich in collagen precursors. But mixing either with a heavy metal? That’s what I call interpretive overreach. One might as well annotate  with nuclear fallout safety tips—well-intentioned, but gravely misaligned with the text’s integrity.

As for modern misinterpretations—I’ve seen contemporary brands market "ancient herbal blends" based on these same formulas, minus the arsenic, naturally. They tout them as “time-tested,” which is technically true, if one ignores the fact that history itself was the test, and not a very ethical one at that.

If you’re drafting a paper, I’d be happy to send along transcriptions of certain passages—assuming you promise not to replicate them in anything more potent than academic ink. And speaking of ink, I must return to cataloguing a newly acquired set of Ming dynasty facial charts. They classify skin types according to the five elements. Not exactly peer-reviewed, but I daresay it has more poetry than a CeraVe insert.
[B]: 

Ah, arsenic for the sake of radiance—now  commitment to the role. I daresay Miss Bingley would’ve approved, had she known her rouge contained lead and her beauty been willing to pay in slow poisoning.

You're absolutely right about the irony: some of these formulations were  onto something—collagen boosters, amino acids, even anti-inflammatory herbs—but then came the toxic flourish that turned tonic into tragedy. Makes one wonder how many historical figures met their end not from intrigue or illness, but from their skincare routine.

And yet, here we are—modern brands repackaging the same traditions with a wink and a disclaimer. “Time-tested,” indeed. More like . One wonders what future dermatologists will make of our current obsessions—will they look back on niacinamide toners the way we now view bloodletting? “They meant well, but perhaps overestimated the skin’s appetite for innovation.”

As for your Ming facial charts and five elements theory—I suspect those charts may offer more psychological balance than biochemical change, but let’s not discount the placebo effect of feeling aligned with the cosmos. Honestly, if五行理论 makes someone feel glowier than a retinol serum, who am I to argue?

I’d be delighted to receive those transcriptions. And don’t worry—I’ll treat them like any good legal document: carefully cited, never replicated without consent, and always filed under "Historical Caution, Not Clinical Guidance."

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe it’s time for another cup. Tea, after all, is the original antioxidant—steeped in tradition, gentle on the barrier function, and best served with a bit of philosophical reflection.
[A]: 

You’ve hit upon the tragedy of historical aesthetics—so many luminous complexions achieved at the cost of, well, one’s remaining years. One wonders if future scholars will unearth our niacinamide toners and tsk-tsk over our naivety with the same weary tone we now reserve for mercury-laced face powders.

And yet—I cannot entirely dismiss the placebo effect you so rightly invoke. There is power in ritual, in the belief that one is aligning with something greater than oneself. Whether it’s the Ming physician diagnosing oily skin as excess fire element or a modern patient applying a serum labeled "clean beauty," the mind-skin axis remains potent. Perhaps even more so when steeped in narrative.

I shall have my research assistant scan those arsenic-laden passages for you by week’s end—carefully, of course. Handling dangerous texts is a bit like prescribing retinoids: slow introduction, protective barriers, and an acceptance that some irritation is inevitable in pursuit of clarity.



Though I must ask—if you were to annotate one misguided skincare belief from the past with a single footnote, what would it be? And how might you word it, assuming footnotes are allowed in this particular edition of history?
[B]: 

Ah, the footnote—I was wondering when we’d come to it. Every era has its editorial sins, and skincare is no exception.

If I were to annotate one misguided belief, it would have to be the 17th-century European conviction that . Pages upon pages of beauty guides from that period extolled the virtues of "fresh air" and "golden complexions," as if melanin were a moral failing rather than melanocytes at work. 

My footnote? Something like this:

> 

It’s a bit cheeky for a scholarly edition, perhaps, but then again—so is the entire history of beauty advice.
[A]: 

Ah, sun-worship as moral imperative—what a  conflation of the metaphysical and the epidermal. You’ve chosen well. One might argue that entire empires were built on less evidence than the belief that paleness equated to virtue—and yet here we are, centuries later, still unpacking the fallout in both dermatology  discourse.

Your footnote does strike the right balance between erudition and cheek—a necessary tone when dealing with authors who prescribed sunlight like a sermon and called it science. I daresay if they’d had access to a decent broad-spectrum filter, half their moral philosophy would have crumbled beneath the weight of a proper sunscreen.

Speaking of textual interventions—ever considered marginalia as a form of preventative care? I’ve been known to scrawl the occasional warning in the margins of 19th-century beauty manuals:  It’s a small act of editorial responsibility, really. Like applying a barrier before the irritant touches down.

Now—shall we adjourn to the botanical gardens? The swallows have been particularly poetic this afternoon, and I find myself in need of a little fieldwork. Or is that too much sunlight for your modern sensibilities?
[B]: 

Ah, preventative marginalia—I may have to adopt that as standard practice. A few well-placed warnings in the right historical text could save future readers from more than just poor life choices.

As for sunlight, I’m not so easily deterred. Provided we find a spot beneath the shade trees—perhaps near the koi pond? There’s something deeply fitting about discussing Ming dermatology theories while watching fish evade their own reflections. Besides, if we’re to continue this discourse, we’ll need an audience of something other than archival dust and tea leaves.

Shall we? I promise not to lecture on UV protection unless provoked by direct exposure—or overly poetic claims about the healing power of nature’s light.
[A]: 

A spot beneath the shade trees, near the koi pond—yes, an excellent choice. One must respect the delicate balance of light and shadow, much like in a well-balanced formulation. And the fish—ever silent, ever watchful—make superb confidants. They’ve likely heard more dubious theories than we could ever offer.



Do you suppose the koi ever tire of their own reflections? I rather suspect they’re engaged in a perpetual debate on identity and surface reading. Very Ming dynasty of them.

Now, shall we continue our discussion on elemental skin theory while observing the interplay of water, light, and piscine philosophy? I warn you, though—I may be inclined to test whether lotus leaves make a suitable alternative to cotton pads. One must always carry scholarly curiosity beyond the confines of the study.
[B]: 

Ah, lotus leaves as cotton pads—now  what I call field formulation. Truly, the future of cosmetology lies in those willing to test theory against nature, even if it means mildly soggy cheeks.

I’d say the koi are quite content in their reflective debates. After all, they’ve mastered the art of surface dwelling—neither fully seen nor entirely hidden. A fitting metaphor for combination skin, perhaps? Balanced between oil and calm, never fully one nor the other.

As for elemental theory by pondside—I’m more than game. There’s something oddly appropriate about discussing  beside water, under wood, with earth beneath our feet. Honestly, if ancient physicians had held more garden seminars, we might have avoided half of skincare history’s more hazardous detours.



Though I must ask—should we ever bottle this atmosphere, what would you name it? A toner infused with Ming philosophy, koi wisdom, and just a hint of tea-scented air?
