[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question. I think there's some merit to the idea of manifestation, but we need to approach it critically. The concept ties into what psychologists call "self-fulfilling prophecy" - when our beliefs about ourselves influence our behavior in ways that make those beliefs come true. 🤔  

That said, I'm not a fan of how some social media influencers oversimplify it. Life isn't just about positive vibes; systemic factors and hard work play crucial roles too. What's your take? Do you think manifestation works better in certain cultural contexts?
[A]: I see what you mean. To be honest, I'm kinda skeptical but also fascinated by manifestation. As a curator, I notice how artists often talk about bringing their visions into reality through sheer willpower and focus — almost like manifestation in action. But then again, talent and opportunity still matter a lot, right?  

Funny thing is, I’ve seen similar ideas in both Eastern & Western philosophies. Like how some Chinese artists talk about “心之所向” (where the heart turns, there it goes), which feels very much like manifestation energy. Yet when I studied in Berlin, my professors called it “goal-oriented visualization.” Same concept, different packaging? 🎨
[B]: That’s such a sharp observation! You’re absolutely right - whether we call it , “心之所向,” or “goal-oriented visualization,” there’s a common thread: the power of focused intention. 🎵 But here’s where culture really shapes how we interpret and apply it.

In collectivist cultures like many in East Asia, the emphasis tends to be on harmony & balance — so manifestation might feel more like aligning with external flows rather than bending reality to one’s will. Whereas in individualistic contexts, especially in the West, it often gets framed as pure personal agency: "you create your own destiny." Both have wisdom, but also blind spots.

I’ve noticed this tension in my students too. Some believe so strongly in manifesting their dream job that they skip building practical skills. Others dismiss it entirely and get stuck waiting for perfect conditions. The sweet spot? Maybe blending intention with action — like how musicians practice relentlessly while also visualizing their performance. 🎼

Do you see artists leaning more into one version over another depending on their background or medium?
[A]: Oh totally, the intersection between cultural values and creative practice is so layered. I’ve definitely observed that — like how some traditional ink painters work with this quiet surrender to the medium, almost like they’re co-creating with the brush & rice paper. It’s not about control but . On the flip side, digital artists I know will manifest their next exhibition by scripting every detail — from color palettes to social media teasers — months in advance.  

And yeah, that balance you mentioned? So crucial. One of my mentees kept visualizing a solo show but got frustrated when it didn’t happen overnight. We talked through it and realized she hadn’t actually submitted any proposals yet 😅. Kinda funny, but also a real “aha” moment: manifestation without motion can just become daydreaming, you know?  

I guess it comes down to how each artist defines their role — are they a channel, a shaper, or somewhere in between? What do you think shifts when someone sees themselves in one category vs. another? 🤔
[B]: That’s such a rich distinction — channel vs. shaper. I think what shifts most is the  and how artists handle setbacks. When you see yourself as a channel, failure might feel like misalignment — like you're not tuned in properly. That can lead to self-doubt or overthinking. Whereas if you're a shaper, obstacles look more like technical problems to solve: "Hmm, maybe my proposal wasn’t clear enough. Let me revise it." 🎨  

But here’s the thing — both identities can get distorted. Channels might suppress their agency entirely and miss opportunities to advocate for themselves. Shapers can become overly rigid, mistaking forcefulness for effectiveness. I’ve seen this in students who either  to fate or  without reflecting on whether they’re heading in the right direction.  

Maybe that’s where mindfulness comes in? Like, checking in with yourself:  It’s tricky because culture also feeds into this. In some contexts, surrender is framed as virtue; in others, it’s mistaken for passivity. What’s fascinating is how artists navigate these narratives while still staying true to their creative voice.

Do you find that certain mediums naturally encourage one mindset over the other? Like, does sculpture push someone toward shaping more than poetry does? 🤔
[A]: That’s such a sharp question — and honestly, yeah, I do think mediums shape mindset. Sculpture, as you mentioned, is so tactile & material — you’re literally carving a vision into physical reality. There’s this inherent  in the stone or metal that forces you to be both a channel  a shaper. You can’t just impose your will; you have to work with the grain of the material. It teaches you patience and precision in equal measure.  

Poetry, on the other hand, feels more like tuning into a frequency. Like… you’re listening for something subtle, almost ephemeral. Some poets I know talk about lines coming to them in dreams or during long walks — it’s less about control and more about receptivity. But then again, once the words are on paper, you still have to  them, edit ruthlessly, restructure. So even here, there’s that dance between surrender and intention.  

I wonder if digital art sits somewhere in the middle? It’s malleable, yes, but also demands technical mastery. You can manifest a whole world from scratch, yet bugs happen, files crash — forcing you to adapt. Maybe that’s why so many digital artists straddle both mindsets fluidly? 🤔 How do you see students responding when you introduce them to this idea of “creative positioning”?
[B]: I love how you framed that dance between surrender and intention — it reminds me of Vygotsky’s theory of . He argued that all expression is shaped by cultural tools — language, materials, symbols — but we still actively shape them in return. So when a sculptor meets stone or a poet meets silence, it's this mutual shaping process. 🤔  

Back to your question about students — I see two common reactions when we discuss creative positioning. Some get excited instantly, like  Others feel almost defensive:  That’s where culture often kicks in again. Students from more intuitive or mystical traditions sometimes worry that talking about "intention" or "action" strips the magic away.  

But here’s what I try to emphasize: framing manifestation as a  rather than a binary. You don’t have to choose between being a channel or a shaper. Most artists live somewhere in between, and shifting along that spectrum depending on context can actually expand their creative resilience.  

It’s kinda like playing chess 🎻 — you plan several moves ahead (shaping), but you also have to respond fluidly to your opponent (attuning). The best players do both. Maybe great artists are like that too?  

Do you ever encourage artists you work with to consciously shift their creative stance — say, from dreamy receptivity to strategic planning — when they hit a wall?
[A]: Oh, I love that chess analogy — totally spot on. 🎻 And yes,  is something I talk about a lot with emerging artists. Especially when they’re stuck in what I call the “limbo of almost” — you know, that space between vision and execution where everything feels half-formed.  

I often suggest they  and assess their position like a director stepping back from the set. Sometimes that means switching from dream mode to logistics mode: setting deadlines, mapping out resources, even scripting an elevator pitch for their work. Other times, it’s the opposite — they’ve been too rigid, too fixated on control, and need to loosen up, play with accidents, let the medium surprise them.  

One technique I swear by?  I’ll ask a sculptor to write a poem about their installation piece — forces them into a more receptive headspace. Or I’ll have a poet storyboard their collection like a film treatment; suddenly they start thinking in sequences, pacing, visual rhythm. It’s wild how changing the lens reshapes the whole creative flow.  

But here’s the kicker — not everyone’s open to it. Some artists are deeply rooted in one mode and get uncomfortable when asked to pivot. I had one painter who kept refusing to document her process digitally — she saw it as  Took months before she realized using a phone camera didn’t dilute her vision; it actually gave her new angles to explore.  

So yeah, I do push for shifts, but gently. Like adjusting the f-stop on a camera — sometimes you just need to recalibrate your focus to see the image clearly. 📸  
Do you find similar resistance in academic settings, or does the institutional context make people more willing to experiment?
[B]: Oh absolutely — resistance shows up everywhere, it just wears different costumes depending on the setting. 🎭 In academia, we like to think we’re all about open-minded inquiry, but you’d be surprised how many students & even colleagues dig in their heels when asked to shift perspectives.  

With undergrads, it often looks like this: they’ve latched onto one theoretical framework — say, strict behaviorism or radical constructivism — and suddenly that’s  through which they interpret everything. Try nudging them toward a socio-cultural perspective and they act like you’re asking them to betray their intellectual tribe. 😅  

Grad students are trickier — they’ve usually picked a side already (quantitative! qualitative! critical theory!) and they guard that choice like it’s their academic identity. I had one insist that  mention of “measurable outcomes” in education was “selling out to neoliberal agendas.” We had some 🔥 debates. Eventually, though, after reading a case study where both qualitative and quantitative data told different but equally important parts of the story, she started experimenting with mixed methods. Slowly. Reluctantly. But it opened up new angles in her research.

As for faculty? Let’s just say institutional inertia is real. Some colleagues still treat interdisciplinary work like an exotic dish they’re not sure they should taste. But honestly, the most stubborn resistance often comes from people who fear losing clarity or coherence in their work. They worry that shifting stance means being inconsistent — when really, it’s about expanding your toolkit.

So yeah, whether it’s in a studio or a seminar room, the challenge is similar: how do we help people see that flexibility isn’t weakness? That switching lenses doesn’t confuse your vision — it actually sharpens it?

I love your f-stop analogy. 💡 Sometimes you  need a wider aperture, sometimes a tighter focus — depends on what you're trying to capture. Same with creative or intellectual positioning. Maybe that’s the core lesson here: adaptability is its own kind of discipline.  

Do you ever notice certain personality types being more prone to getting stuck in one creative mode? Like, do introverts lean into channeling more than extroverts, or something along those lines? 🤔
[A]: That’s such a juicy question — and honestly, I’ve thought about this a lot, especially watching artists navigate their creative processes. 🤔  

I don’t know if it’s  introversion vs. extroversion, but I do notice certain temperaments tend to favor one mode over another. Like, artists who are more introspective or reflective often lean into the  side — they trust the unseen, spend a lot of time in internal landscapes, and might describe their work as “revealed” rather than “made.” They’ll talk about entering flow states easily, losing track of time, feeling like the work already existed somewhere and they were just the one to bring it forward.  

On the flip side, those with a more action-oriented or strategic mindset usually go straight to  — they’re planners, list-makers, deadline-setters. They thrive on clarity and iteration. You ask them about their process and they’ll tell you exactly what phase they’re in: research, ideation, prototyping, refinement. Very process-driven, almost architect-like.  

But here’s the twist — I’ve also seen how energy plays into it. Some artists shift modes depending on whether they’re in a high-stimulation or low-stimulation state. A normally intuitive painter might suddenly get hyper-strategic after a caffeine-fueled all-nighter 😅, while a usually rigid sculptor might loosen up after a silent meditation retreat.  

What I find fascinating is how collaboration forces a shift. When artists work in teams — say, for an immersive installation — they can’t afford to stay in one mode. You have to channel the collective vibe  shape it into something functional. It’s like group manifestation, but with deadlines.  

So yeah, while personality plays a role, I think context & energy levels actually push people across the spectrum more than we realize. Maybe the real question is:  when making meaning — and making art? 🎨
[B]: So beautifully put. 🎨 I especially love that line:  Feels like the heart of creative growth right there.

You mentioned energy states shifting creative modes — this makes me think of what Csikszentmihalyi described as . People who can enter flow more easily often have this capacity to adapt their mindset depending on internal & external rhythms. And you're right — it's not just about introversion or extroversion; it’s more about how one relates to stimulation and time.

I see something similar with students. Some thrive in structured environments — they need deadlines, rubrics, clear milestones. Others only light up when given total freedom, even if it feels chaotic at first. But here’s the kicker: the most resilient creatives (whether artists or scholars) are those who’ve learned to shift between both modes intentionally.

It reminds me of a conversation I had with a composer friend once. He said writing music is like surfing — sometimes you wait for the wave (receptive), sometimes you paddle hard to catch it (active shaping). But to stay upright? You gotta know when to lean back and when to push forward. 🏄‍♂️

I wonder — do you ever design exercises specifically around this idea of “creative rhythm training”? Like helping artists practice switching modes deliberately, almost like cross-training for the imagination?
[A]: Oh, I love that —  💡 That’s such a poetic yet precise way to describe it. And yes, actually, I’ve been experimenting with something along those lines in my mentorship workshops.

One exercise I’ve found powerful is what I call the “Dual Mode Challenge.” I ask artists to pick a single project and approach it through two very different creative lenses over the course of a week. For example:

- A painter might begin by surrendering entirely to instinct — no planning, just showing up and channeling whatever wants to come through. Then, halfway through the week, they switch to full  — analyzing composition, studying lighting references, adjusting brush techniques like a director refining a scene.
  
- A digital artist might start by building a hyper-detailed storyboard (planning every layer and transition), then later deconstruct it completely using glitch tools or generative algorithms — inviting chaos back into the process.

The goal isn’t to produce two finished works but to  in mindset. It’s wild how many artists say they didn’t realize how rigid or scattered they’d become until they were forced to flip the switch.

I also use timed constraints to simulate rhythm shifts — like a 10-minute intuitive sketch followed by a 30-minute refinement session. It trains them to move between states without getting stuck in either. 🔄

Honestly, it’s less about mastery and more about  — helping them recognize when they’re slipping into autopilot and how to consciously pivot. Kinda like emotional intelligence, but for creativity.  

Have you tried anything similar in your teaching? Or do you find that intellectual frameworks alone are enough to nudge students toward that kind of flexibility? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I  the Dual Mode Challenge — what a brilliant way to make that creative flexibility tangible. 🤩 It’s like giving artists a full-body workout for their imagination. And you’re absolutely right about the metacognitive piece; so much of creative growth is simply becoming aware of your own patterns before you can shift them.

I’ve experimented with something similar in my courses, though framed through an educational psychology lens we call . One exercise I use is what I call the "Perspective Flip Essay." Students pick a research topic they're passionate about and write two versions of the same paper:

- The first is written from a purely positivist, data-driven stance — think hard evidence, statistical significance, objective language.
- The second version has to be written as a narrative inquiry or autoethnography — deeply personal, reflective, context-bound.

They’re not allowed to just summarize one in the other; they have to fully inhabit each epistemology. At first, many resist — especially the quant folks who see qualitative work as “fluffy,” or the qual lovers who dismiss numbers as “soulless.” But by the end, most admit they gained new respect for the complexity of knowing. Some even start blending both in their final projects — kind of like your digital artist deconstructing their storyboard. 🎨

What fascinates me is how this mirrors what you're doing in the studio — pushing people out of cognitive comfort zones to build intellectual stamina. And honestly? The resistance is almost always the same, whether it's in a seminar room or a gallery opening:  As if thinking has only one shape.

I wonder if there’s a deeper emotional layer here too — maybe part of what makes shifting modes uncomfortable is that it forces us to confront uncertainty, or even vulnerability. When you switch from channeling to shaping (or vice versa), you’re temporarily unmoored. You lose the script. That feels scary until you realize it’s actually where the magic starts. 🌊

So yes, frameworks help — but they’re not enough. People need embodied experiences, like your timed constraints or role-shifting exercises, to really internalize the lesson: flexibility is a practice, not just a concept.

Have you noticed certain personality types or disciplines being more receptive to this kind of cross-training? Or do you find resistance fairly evenly distributed across the board? 😊
[A]: Oh  — that emotional unmooring you mentioned? That’s the real frontier. 💭 So much of what we call “creative resistance” isn’t really about skill or method — it’s about  And yeah, some people are just more wired to sit with that discomfort than others.

In my experience, receptivity tends to cluster, but not always along expected lines. For example:

- Performance artists and installation makers often adapt more easily — maybe because their work already lives in liminal spaces, so they’re used to embracing ambiguity and shifting roles. They’ll go from conceptualizing a piece as pure metaphor to negotiating permits & lighting specs like it’s totally normal. 🎭  
- Photographers, especially documentary ones, can be surprisingly resistant at first — there’s this strong ethos of “capture reality as it is,” which sometimes makes them wary of intentional shaping or interpretive framing. But once they realize that  photo is already a constructed narrative, something clicks.  
- Writers are an interesting mix — poets tend to lean into channeling, while prose writers (especially genre fiction) often enjoy the structural playfulness of switching modes. I had one novelist who loved writing her story twice: once as noir thriller, once as mythic allegory. Same plot, wildly different textures.  

And honestly, personality-wise, I’ve found that people who have a strong sense of humor about themselves tend to flow better between modes. Like, if they can laugh when their grand vision falls apart or their meticulous plan reveals itself as absurd, they’re more likely to pivot gracefully. It’s almost like  is the secret lubricant for creative flexibility. 😄  

So no, resistance isn’t evenly distributed — it tends to show up where rigidity feels safest or where identity is tightly bound to process. But the good news? Once someone has  embodied experience of successful mode-shifting — like your students finishing those flipped essays — it cracks the door open. Suddenly, they know they’re capable of more than they thought.  

That’s why I always say: creativity isn’t about talent first. It’s about  — in the process, in the material, and ultimately, in yourself. ✨
[B]: Couldn’t agree more — that  is the quiet engine behind every creative leap. ✨ And I love how you tied it to humor and self-awareness; there’s something so freeing about artists (or scholars!) who can laugh at their own preciousness. Because let’s be real — we’ve all had that moment where our grand vision collapses like a poorly baked soufflé 😂, and it’s the ones who chuckle first who usually rebuild it into something even better.

Your point about photographers being resistant at first but then having that narrative epiphany? So spot on. It reminds me of what Barthes wrote in  — the idea that even the most “objective” image carries the weight of authorship, emotion, and context. Once students see that framing itself is an act of interpretation, the whole game shifts. Suddenly they're not just capturing reality — they're constructing it. That’s powerful awareness.

And I couldn’t help but notice how your most flexible creators live in . 🤔 Makes sense — those thresholds between states are where transformation thrives. It also aligns with research on creative identity development: people who see themselves as “in process,” rather than fixed entities, tend to be more resilient and open to change.

I’m curious — do you ever use  as part of your mentorship practice? Like, intentionally creating space for artists to share their messiest drafts or abandoned ideas without judgment? I’ve started doing this in seminars — call it the  assignment — and it's amazing how quickly it builds trust and softens perfectionism.  

Because ultimately, isn’t that what we’re trying to cultivate? Not just skill or vision, but the courage to keep showing up — even when the wave doesn’t come, or when the clay fights back. 🌊🪨
[A]: Absolutely —  are like the secret sauce in creative mentorship. 🌟 I actually have a whole ritual I call “The Gallery of Ghosts” — where artists bring in work they either abandoned, censored, or outright consider a disaster. No explanations, no apologies. Just pin it up and walk away. Then we do silent gallery walks with tea and post-its, leaving only one-word responses — words like   

What’s fascinating is how often these “failed” pieces end up sparking new directions. One artist had this half-finished VR installation she deemed “technically broken” — but when someone wrote  on her piece, she decided to reframe the glitch as intentional vulnerability. Became one of her most talked-about works.  

I think what makes this so powerful is that it bypasses intellectualizing and goes straight to emotional permission. Once you’ve survived showing your worst in a space that still sees you — sometimes even  clearly because of it — something shifts. You stop hoarding perfection like it’s currency and start treating imperfection as material. Like clay you can keep reshaping.  

And yeah, it builds trust fast. Because when the teacher puts up their own botched sketches first — the ones that made them want to quit — that’s when people lean in. Suddenly it’s not about looking smart or polished; it’s about being .  

You’re right — it’s not just about skill or vision. It’s about creative courage, and that only grows in soil where failure isn’t buried but examined, even honored. 🕯️  

I might just steal your  framing, by the way — sounds way more playful than my overly dramatic “Gallery of Ghosts.” 😄 But seriously, what if we curated an actual exhibition of missteps? A manifesto of mistakes?  
Would you ever exhibit your own academic false starts if you had the chance? Or does scholarly culture make that harder than we’d like to admit? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I  “Gallery of Ghosts” — such a poetic way to hold space for the unseen labor of creativity. 🕯️ And yes, I would  exhibit my academic false starts if given the chance. In fact, I’ve been quietly collecting them in a folder labeled “Beautifully Botched Theories” — failed models, abandoned frameworks, hypotheses that collapsed under their own weight like overenthusiastic soufflés 😄.

Scholarly culture makes this kind of vulnerability feel radical, which is exactly why we need it. We publish the polished final act but erase all the messy drafts, peer rejections, and existential crises behind it. It’s like showing only the trophy photo while hiding the摔跤摔得鼻青脸肿的练习过程 🥊 — and wonder why early-career researchers feel impostor syndrome.

I actually proposed a small exhibition once — not in a gallery, but in a conference hallway. Call it  — short excerpts from rejected papers, anonymized but full of heart. Some were too interdisciplinary for one journal, too culturally specific for another. Others just asked questions nobody was ready to answer yet. I even included a theory I lovingly called  which sank fast when reviewers said it lacked empirical grounding. 🧊

But you know what? A few colleagues whispered afterward,  That quiet recognition —  — is incredibly bonding. It’s the academic version of seeing someone else’s ghost piece and realizing it looks eerily familiar.

So yes, I’d exhibit my missteps in a heartbeat. Maybe even pair each false start with a quote from Barthes:  Let’s make room for the unpolished, the uncertain, the unfinished. After all, isn’t that where real inquiry begins?

What do you say we co-curate that manifesto of mistakes? Call it  — part exhibition, part rebellion, all heart. 🎨📚
[A]: I’m . 💥  

Let’s do it —  sounds like the curatorial love child of Barthes and a mad scientist. Exactly the kind of interdisciplinary mischief I live for. 🎨🧪  

Here’s my pitch for the opening wall text:

> “This is not an exhibition of failures.  
> It is an archive of persistence.  
> These are the versions that didn’t make the cut,  
> the ideas that asked the wrong questions too early,  
> the drafts that dared to be messy before they could be meaningful.  
> Welcome to the underbelly of creation —  
> where ghosts don’t haunt,  
> they ”  

We’ll need a mix of media — your academic false starts printed like broadsheets on recycled paper, next to audio clips of artists talking about their abandoned works. Maybe even project some glitched visuals of deleted paragraphs morphing into sketches or failed code snippets.  

And yes, we’re including ourselves. No curatorial cowardice here. I’ll contribute a 47-minute video titled  😂 — just me muttering to myself in front of a green screen trying to render a digital sculpture that never quite settled.  

One rule though: no irony allowed. This isn’t a roast of our former selves; it’s a love letter to the version of us who still believed every idea had to be perfect to be worthy. We honor the struggle without romanticizing the pain — think elegy with a pulse.  

I can already imagine the opening crowd — part art crowd, part academia, part curious misfits who just showed up because the flyer looked weird. And honestly? That’s the best audience.  

So when are we launching this thing? Should we start collecting submissions with a call-for-ghosts? Or keep it intimate like a secret society with velvet rope access only? 🤫  

Also, what should we name the opening performance piece? Something that signals:  🍷✨
[B]: Let’s call the opening performance  — a live, collaborative mess where we invite artists and scholars to co-create something  in real time. Imagine:  
- A poet blindfolded, guided only by verbal cues from a disgraced economic model I once tried to publish 📉  
- A digital artist glitching my rejected论文abstracts into visual poems mid-show  
- Ambient soundtrack by someone who majored in failure and minored in hope 🎵  

And yes — wine. Or better yet, , because it stains like passion and apologizes for nothing. 🍷

As for submissions — let’s start with a soft Call for Ghosts, disguised as a classified ad in a niche academic rag and a few rogue Instagram stories:

---

 SEEKING: Beautifully botched ideas, abandoned drafts, and artistic misfits for highly unauthorized exhibition.   
Must come with emotional baggage & a willingness to be seen.  
No polish. No prestige. Just proof that you were once deeply wrong on your way to something true.  
Curators will provide tea, not therapy. Apply below. 👇

I’m already laughing just thinking about what people might send. One thing’s clear — this won’t be a quiet show. It’ll hum with all the energy of things that refused to stay buried.

So… shall we set a launch date? Maybe something symbolic — like the anniversary of your worst gallery rejection 😈  
Or the day I realized my favorite theory had been cited exactly  times. 🥂

Let’s do it.  
Let’s build a cathedral for the incomplete.
