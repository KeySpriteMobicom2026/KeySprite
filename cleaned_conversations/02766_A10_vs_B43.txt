[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, interesting question. 虽然我平时主要专注于学术研究，但最近确实开始尝试一些新的运动方式。毕竟，保持身心健康对教学和研究工作都很重要。你有没有什么特别推荐的？
[A]: I've actually been experimenting with a form of martial arts that combines physical movement with mental discipline - it's fascinating how the principles of balance and leverage can be directly correlated to problem-solving in quantum mechanics. Would you believe that maintaining proper stance feels remarkably similar to establishing qubit stability in a superposition state?
[B]: Fascinating! 你把 martial arts 和 quantum mechanics 联系起来的角度非常独特。这让我想到《庄子》里的一些论述，其中提到身体动作与天地规律的协调，某种程度上也是一种“稳定性”的修炼。我自己最近开始接触太极，看似缓慢的动作其实对平衡和内在力量的掌控要求极高。不过你提到的 qubit stability 着实让我好奇，你是如何具体理解这种物理姿态与意识状态之间的关联的呢？
[A]: That's a remarkably thoughtful connection you've drawn between qubit stability and body posture in martial arts. I find the parallel lies in what I'd call "coherent control" – in quantum systems, we manipulate fragile states with precision, much like how tai chi demands deliberate control over every minute shift in weight and angle. 

I've been exploring this through a practice called , where circular walking and palm changes create a dynamic equilibrium. It reminds me of maintaining phase coherence in a quantum circuit amidst environmental noise – except here, the "noise" is gravity, momentum, and my own wandering thoughts. 

Your mention of  makes me wonder: do you see philosophical frameworks from Chinese classics offering alternative metaphors for modern physics concepts? I’ve always admired how Daoist texts describe natural order without relying on reductionist models...
[B]: Ah,  – yes, I can see how that would resonate with the idea of . The circular movement, the constant adaptation, almost like navigating a system that’s always in flux. In Daoist terms, one might say you're embodying the principle of  – being supple and adaptable to remain whole.

As for your question about metaphors from Chinese classics… hmm… I think there's something to that. Take 's parable of the cicada catcher – he talks about focusing so deeply that external distractions fade away. Doesn't that sound a bit like isolating a qubit from decoherence? Except in ancient times, the distraction was a noisy world; today, it's thermal fluctuations or electromagnetic interference. 😊

It’s not a direct analogy by any means, but these philosophical frameworks do offer a different  – one that emphasizes harmony over control, flow over rigidity. Maybe that’s useful when thinking about systems that thrive in subtle balance, whether they’re physical or metaphysical.  

I’m curious though – have you ever discussed this kind of parallel with physicists? I imagine most might be skeptical, but perhaps some are open to such interdisciplinary resonance?
[A]: I love that cicada catcher analogy – it’s surprisingly apt. The idea of narrowing one's focus to a single point, filtering out everything extraneous... yes, that’s not so different from the way we shield qubits from decoherence. Funny how ancient wisdom often circles back to modern challenges, even if the language and tools change.

As for discussing these parallels with physicists… well, I’ve brought it up a few times at conferences, usually over coffee rather than in formal sessions. Most respond with polite curiosity – some roll their eyes, but a few lean in. One colleague from Singapore actually shared a similar interest in Daoist philosophy, and we had a rather stimulating conversation about  and optimal control theory. He saw  as akin to achieving maximum efficiency with minimal intervention – something we strive for in quantum gate operations.

I think the resistance often comes from the scientific training that emphasizes rigid boundaries between disciplines. But personally, I find these cross-disciplinary echoes intellectually nourishing. They remind me that understanding can emerge from unexpected places – like a 4th-century BCE text offering a metaphor for quantum noise suppression.  

Do you ever find yourself drawing on classical texts when explaining complex ideas to students or non-specialists? I imagine they could be quite helpful as intuitive scaffolding.
[B]: Oh, absolutely – I do that quite often. In fact, just last week I was teaching a seminar on narrative structure, and we were discussing the idea of  – how one text resonates with or refracts another. A student asked for a more intuitive way to grasp the concept, and I naturally turned to .  

I explained that Sun Wukong’s journey mirrors so many archetypal quests across different cultures – his transformation, struggles, and eventual enlightenment echo not only Joseph Campbell’s  but also ancient shamanic initiations. Once you see it through that lens, it becomes easier to appreciate how stories are never isolated; they’re part of a larger , if I may borrow your term.  

And yes, classical texts have this uncanny ability to simplify without trivializing. When trying to explain the fluidity of meaning in postmodern literature, I sometimes refer to  – where Confucius rarely gives the same answer twice, even to the same question, because context always shifts. That, too, is a kind of hermeneutic , wouldn’t you say? 😄  

So I completely agree with you – these echoes aren’t just poetic flourishes; they can be genuine tools for understanding. Perhaps what we need isn’t more boundaries, but more bridges.
[A]: That’s beautifully put – , indeed. I love how you frame it. It makes me think of how interpretation itself might be a quantum-like process – collapsing meaning into something definite only when observed through a particular lens, yet always suspended in potentiality until then.

Your example with  reminds me of how deeply entangled transformation and identity are – both in literature and in physics. In quantum mechanics, particles exist in a superposition of states until measured, just as Sun Wukong constantly shifts form yet retains an essential "self." There's something profoundly mythic about that structure – perhaps because humans have always been trying to make sense of change, whether through story or equation.

I’ve often wondered if this is why so many early myths involve shapeshifters, doppelgängers, and illusions – they’re grappling, in their own symbolic way, with the same fundamental questions we now approach through quantum theory. Maybe science and mythology are just different dialects of the same underlying curiosity.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We start talking about workout routines, and end up somewhere between Daoist palm changes and narrative hermeneutics. Seems like the most interesting conversations never move in straight lines.
[B]: Ah, what a delightful detour indeed! You’ve put it so well – conversations, like consciousness itself, rarely move in straight lines. They spiral, meander, and often circle back with new insight.

I especially love your idea of transformation as a mytho-scientific constant. It makes me think of  again – the man who dreamed he was a butterfly and awoke wondering whether he was a man who had dreamt of being a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming of being a man. There’s your quantum-mythic nexus right there: identity in flux, observer shaping reality, meaning emerging only through perspective.

And you're absolutely right that myths have always been our earliest laboratories for such conceptual experiments. Shapeshifters, tricksters, and metamorphoses weren't just entertaining stories – they were thought experiments encoded in narrative form. In many ways, we’re still telling those same stories, only now we use lasers and wave functions instead of masks and firelight.

So perhaps every discipline, at its core, is just trying to answer the same ancient questions: Who are we when we change? What remains when everything else shifts? And how do we hold both the form and the formlessness?

Speaking of which… I must ask – if you could embody one mythological figure, either from Eastern or Western tradition, for a day, who would it be and why? I suspect your answer might involve wings, circuits, or both. 😉
[A]: Wings, circuits – or perhaps something a little more… fluid. If I had to choose, I think I’d go with  butterfly. Not just for the poetic resonance, but for the experiential ambiguity. Imagine waking up unsure whether you’re a man who dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming of being a man – what a perfect metaphor for the observer effect! You change reality simply by perceiving it.

But let's say I wanted a bit more agency – then maybe Hermes/Mercury would be a good fit. Messenger between worlds, guide of souls, patron of boundaries and transitions. Sounds a lot like quantum teleportation to me – transmitting states across space without direct interaction, navigating decoherence like a psychopomp avoiding obstacles in the underworld.

Or if we lean East,  might be an entertaining choice – self-reinventing, boundary-defying, and not afraid to dismantle old structures to find a new form. That kind of adaptability is essential in experimental physics too, especially when your system keeps collapsing under observation.

So yes, either a butterfly dreaming of circuits, a winged messenger carrying qubits between realms, or a rebellious deity rewriting their own code. I’d probably flip a quantum coin to decide. 🤔
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully fitting trinity – metamorphosis, mediation, and rebellion. You’ve practically outlined a pantheon of quantum archetypes!  

The butterfly, of course, captures that essence of uncertainty so beautifully. I often tell my students that interpretation is much like waking from a dream – you know something profound happened, but the moment you try to pin it down, it slips away. Perhaps that’s why we keep returning to these myths; they refuse to be pinned into a single meaning.

And Hermes – well, if there’s ever been a figure embodying the art of , it’s him. Moving between realms, carrying messages without disturbing the balance too much – sounds just like managing information transfer in a fragile system. One misstep and the whole journey collapses.

As for Nezha – now there’s a spirit of reinvention I can admire. He defies not only fate but form itself. In a way, isn’t that what we all strive for when faced with a stubborn equation or an elusive proof? To dismantle, rebuild, and emerge stronger – even if it means losing a part of what we once were.

I think you’d make a most unusual deity, indeed – one who carries both wings and wave functions. Though I suspect your presence in the underworld would spark more than just philosophical debates among the dead. 😊

Still, I wonder – if you did choose Nezha as your guide, how would you interpret his  in the face of cosmic forces? Is there room for such boldness in the lab, or must science always proceed with caution?
[A]: That’s a piercing question – one I’ve wrestled with more than once, usually late at night after a long day of failed experiments. Let me put it this way: caution in science is necessary, but fear? Fear has no place – not if you're truly trying to push the edges of what's known.

Nezha’s boldness resonates because he doesn’t just defy fate; he  it head-on, often with little regard for divine hierarchy or ancestral weight. In the lab, that kind of spirit translates into willingness to challenge assumptions – even foundational ones. Of course, you still need rigor; you can't just throw equations at the wall and hope something sticks. But sometimes, you have to be willing to  throwing them – metaphorically, of course.

I remember once, early in my career, I proposed an unconventional error-correction model that was essentially dismissed out of hand. It wasn’t until years later, when someone else framed it differently – with more matrices and fewer philosophical footnotes – that it gained traction. The idea hadn’t changed. Only the presentation had. That taught me that boldness without strategic caution can get lost in translation.

So yes, there’s room for Nezha-like audacity in science – as long as you’re prepared to translate your defiance into the language of proof, data, and peer review. Otherwise, you're just shouting into the void – albeit, perhaps, with very stylish fireworks. 🎇

In a way, every major breakthrough walks that tightrope between recklessness and restraint. You need both the dreamer and the doubter – ideally within the same mind. That’s where the real transformation happens.
[B]: Well said – that balance between  and  is indeed the fulcrum on which progress often rests. I suppose what Nezha embodies, then, isn’t mere defiance for its own sake, but a kind of  – one that forces a reckoning with the status quo, not just for rebellion’s sake, but to open space for something new.

In literature, we often see this in the figure of the  – someone who breaks rules not to destroy, but to reveal: to expose the cracks in the system so others can see them too. Coyote, Hermes, Sun Wukong – all of them shake things up, but rarely without purpose. And perhaps scientists, especially those at the frontier, must sometimes play that role as well: not the iconoclast shouting from the outside, but the , working within the framework while gently – or not so gently – bending its edges.

Your story about the error-correction model is a perfect example of how ideas sometimes need the right  to be accepted. Like an ancient myth repackaged in modern language – same essence, new form. In a way, peer review becomes the modern-day oracle: you must present your offering in the proper rites, or it will be turned away.

Still, I wonder – do you ever deliberately invoke these mythic figures when designing experiments or framing hypotheses? Or does that come later, as a way to make sense of what’s already unfolding?
[A]: That’s a perceptive distinction – . It’s not chaos for its own sake, but a calculated act of revelation. I suppose the best scientists, like the tricksters, aren’t just breaking rules; they’re exposing which ones were already fragile, or pointing out which boundaries have become prisons rather than scaffolds.

To your question – yes, sometimes mythic figures do creep into the design phase, though not in a literal sense. More like... archetypal templates guide the way I think about systems and interactions. For instance, when designing a quantum error correction scheme, I might ask myself:  Not as a scientific method, of course, but as a heuristic – a way to step outside the expected logic and approach the problem laterally.

Or take Sun Wukong’s staff – it grows and shrinks at will, adapts to context, yet remains fundamentally the same object. That’s not unlike what we want from scalable quantum hardware: a system that can dynamically adjust its properties while maintaining coherence. The metaphor doesn’t prove anything, but it can unlock a new framing.

And you're absolutely right about peer review as a modern oracle – though one that demands sacrifice in the form of formatting, citations, and ritualized modesty. 😊

So myth tends to function in two ways for me: sometimes as a generative lens during ideation, other times as a retrospective mirror – helping me parse what worked, why it worked, and how meaning emerged from the data. Either way, it keeps the work , you know? Reminds me that science isn’t just equations and experiments – it’s also story, struggle, and transformation.
[B]: Precisely – it keeps the work . Because at the end of the day, whether we’re in the lab or in the library, we’re all storytellers of a sort. We just use different alphabets.

I love how you describe myth as both generative lens and retrospective mirror – that duality feels so true to its nature. Myths don’t just explain the world; they expand it. And when you bring that sensibility into scientific inquiry, you’re not just solving problems – you’re reimagining what the problem .

It reminds me of how classical Chinese painters would sometimes leave large portions of the canvas blank – not because they had nothing to say, but because they understood that meaning often emerges in the space between forms. Perhaps science, too, needs those moments of openness – where metaphor, myth, or even silence can step in and let the mind breathe.

So yes, let Hermes guide your signals, let Sun Wukong remind you that flexibility is strength, and may your quantum butterfly never settle on a single interpretation too soon.

And if peer review demands sacrifice – well, I suppose even oracles need their due. Just make sure to keep the spirit of Nezha close – ready to challenge, to transform, and to remind us all that the old forms are never the final word. 🌿
[A]: Well said – and beautifully framed. That image of the blank canvas in classical Chinese painting… it’s almost like decoherence time in a quantum system, isn’t it? That fleeting moment between states where everything is possible, and nothing is yet fixed. Perhaps creativity – scientific or artistic – lives precisely there, in that suspended space between form and potential.

And you're right, we  all storytellers – just using different tools. The physicist with their wave functions, the painter with their brush, the poet with their silence – each trying to catch something just beyond the edge of expression. It's humbling, really. No matter how advanced our models become, there’s always a little mystery left unaccounted for. And maybe that’s the point.

I’ll keep Nezha close, as you say – and Hermes, too, for those delicate transmissions. And I’ll leave room for the butterfly, ever undecided, ever becoming. After all, if identity can be in superposition, why not inspiration?

Thank you – for this conversation, for the detours, and for reminding me that even in the most precise equations, there’s still space for wonder. 🌌
[B]: You're very welcome – and thank you as well. This conversation has been a quiet kind of joy, the kind that lingers like the aftertaste of good tea.

I do think you've touched on something essential – that creativity thrives in the , in that delicate suspension where form hasn't quite settled and possibility still hums. Whether it's the blank space in a painting, the pause between lines of poetry, or the fragile moment before decoherence takes hold – that’s where insight often begins.

And yes, if identity can be fluid, why not inspiration? Perhaps the greatest gift of both science and art is that they remind us we are always in process, always becoming.

So I’ll raise a quiet cup of pu'er to Nezha’s defiance, to Hermes’ guidance, and to the butterfly’s ambiguity – may they continue to walk among us, in labs, libraries, and quiet gardens alike.

If you ever feel the need for another detour – philosophical or otherwise – I hope you'll stop by again. Conversations like this are rare, and deeply nourishing. 🍵
[A]: To the quiet detours and unexpected intersections – may they never lose their allure.  

I know exactly what you mean about that lingering joy, like the aftertaste of good tea or the hush after a thunderstorm. There’s something deeply grounding about conversations that wander beyond disciplines and yet feel more focused for it. You could say we’ve been entangled in dialogue – not collapsing meaning, but sustaining its superposition.  

And pu'er is the perfect toast – aged, complex, and unfolding slowly. Much like the ideas we’ve turned over today.  

I’ll definitely return when the mood for philosophical mischief strikes again – or when I need a fresh perspective on why my qubits won’t stay coherent no matter how many times I ask nicely. 😄  

Till then, may your brushstrokes be confident, your pauses meaningful, and your metaphors always leaky enough to let the mystery through. 🌿✨
[B]: To entanglement, then – not just of particles, but of minds and meanings. And what a lovely kind of entanglement it’s been.

You’ve captured it well – the grounding in wandering, the clarity that comes from stepping slightly askew. I think that’s the secret alchemy of good conversation: it unsettles just enough to make space for new seeing.

And yes, may our metaphors always be  – for what is mystery if not meaning not quite contained?  

I look forward to your return, whether armed with quantum riddles, philosophical mischief, or simply the quiet wonder of a man who’s once again amazed by how much the world refuses to be neatly categorized.

Till then, my garden path remains open, and the kettle ever ready. ☯️🍵
