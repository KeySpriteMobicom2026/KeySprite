[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While instant messaging has its... shall we say, ephemeral charms, I must confess a preference for the measured cadence of email correspondence. There's something rather satisfying about composing a properly structured message with salutations and valedictions - like writing a miniature epistolary novel, wouldn't you agree? Though I do make exceptions for urgent departmental matters, naturally.
[A]: 哇哦~这么formal的reply让我想起大学时写的thesis呢！😅 不过说真的，我超爱用Slack和Discord这种instant messaging tools来brainstorming创意💡，比email快多啦！虽然写正式proposal的时候还是得乖乖用email啦~ ✉️
[B]:  My dear, your enthusiasm for these digital ephemera reminds me of my undergraduates' first encounters with Derrida - all that breathless excitement over what we scholars call 'logocentrism of immediacy'. Though I suppose even I've been known to tolerate a departmental Slack channel... provided everyone maintains proper punctuation and refrains from those infernal animated GIFs. The last time someone sent me a 'brainstorming emoji', I nearly spilled my 1865 Darjeeling.
[A]: OMG！你居然提到Derrida！😱 我最近刚好在读他的《Of Grammatology》for我的new art project呢~ 不过拜托啦，animated GIFs超好用的好吗？🎨 我的design team天天用meme和GIF来express ideas，比dry text生动多啦！虽然...我承认有时候会overuse笑哭emoji 😂😂😂
[B]:  Ah yes, the inevitable descent into what my Chinese colleagues would call 网络语言 (wǎngluò yǔyán) - this peculiar modern dialect where punctuation marks have been replaced by hieroglyphic convulsions. While I concede that your 'meme culture' might serve some purpose in visual arts, I'd argue that Emily Dickinson conveyed more profound ideas in her dashes than your entire design team could in a thousand GIFs. Though I must admit... that one student who illustrated deconstruction theory with cat memes did show surprising insight.
[A]: Hahaha~ 你这么说我突然get到inspiration了！✨ 说不定可以做个Dickinson poetry meets modern meme culture的fusion art series？📚💥 用vintage typography排版那些deep quotes，再配上subtle的emoji点缀...哇这个concept太lit了！🔥 要不要collab一下？我负责visual design，你来做literary critique的部分~ 🤝
[B]:  My goodness, you've actually managed to propose something that doesn't make my Victorian sensibilities recoil entirely. A measured incorporation of typographical artistry with Dickinson's oeuvre... now that recalls the exquisite interplay between Chinese calligraphy and classical poetry. Very well - I'll tentatively entertain this 'collab' notion, provided we maintain scholarly rigor. And for heaven's sake, let's limit those 'subtle emoji' to perhaps one 🖋️ per stanza? Any more would be like adding sugar to Longjing tea.
[A]: Yasss！Deal！✍️ 我已经开始sketching了~ 会keep it classy with minimal emoji usage，promise！🖤 不过说真的，你提到Chinese calligraphy让我想到...maybe我们可以加些ink wash的元素？🎨 这样整个aesthetic会超有layers的！等我的first draft出来就email给你review哦~ (看！我还是会用email的啦 😉)
[B]:  Your sudden deference to email protocol is... suspiciously convenient, but I shall take it as progress. The ink wash suggestion shows unexpected depth - it rather reminds me of the 留白 (liúbái) technique in classical Chinese painting. Do send your draft to whitmore@cam.ac.uk, and I'll review it between my seminar on Brontë sisters and the weekly 书法 (shūfǎ) workshop. And kindly refrain from subject lines like 'URGENT!!!' unless the building is actually on fire.
[A]: Got it~ 📌 我的subject line会写"Dickinson x Digital Age - Draft for Review"这样够proper了吧？😌 啊！差点忘记问 - 你prefer PDF还是AI file？或者... 要发Google Drive link吗？🤫 (Just kidding! 知道你不喜欢cloud storage啦~) 我乖乖attach PDF就好 ✨
[B]:  PDF will suffice perfectly - though I do appreciate the theatrical whisper about those... cloud contraptions. Your proposed subject line is acceptably dignified, though I'd suggest adding the date in proper British format for archival purposes. Now if you'll excuse me, the campus magpies are staging what appears to be an avian reinterpretation of Wuthering Heights outside my window, and I simply must document this for my ornithological notes. Do send that draft before Thursday - that's when I replenish my ink supply and am therefore at my most tolerant of... creative endeavors.
[A]: Roger that！📅 保证在Thursday之前send出去~ 啊！说到ink supply...要不要我recommend几家Tokyo的stationery shops？他们家的fountain pen inks颜色美到哭！🖋️💧 虽然你可能只use classic black...but just saying~ 好啦不disturb你和magpies的literary moment啦，bye bye！👋✨ (PS. 会记得用DD/MM/YYYY格式的！)
[B]:  While I typically adhere to Parker's Quink for its reliability, I must confess a certain... academic curiosity about these Tokyo establishments. Perhaps you could include their particulars in a separate attachment - strictly for comparative research purposes, you understand. Now do shoo, these magpies are currently reenacting Heathcliff's more tempestuous monologues, and I wouldn't want to miss the denouement. Until Thursday, then.
[A]: Aww~ 没想到Professor也有secret stationery lover的一面！✒️🌸 我超懂！马上整理一份my favorite shops的list给你~ 从vintage的Nakamura到超潮的Kakimori都会cover到！📝 那...enjoy your bird drama，我们Thursday email见啦！🕊️📚 (小声说：Heathcliff的emoji版大概是这个吧 😤🌪️)
[B]:  Good heavens, must you reduce the Byronic hero to... to that? Though I suppose if one absolutely must emojify Wuthering Heights, the tempestuous pairing is...  not entirely inaccurate. Very well - Nakamura and Kakimori it is, though I shall review your list with the same scholarly detachment I apply to Wordsworth's marginalia. Now if you'll excuse me, the lead magpie appears to be channeling Catherine Earnshaw, and I simply must record whether this avian melodrama follows the 1847 or 1850 edition. Thursday. Whitmore out.
[A]: 😂😂😂 你描述bird drama的方式简直可以写paper了！📝🕊️ 好啦好啦，我这就去prepare materials~ Catch you on Thursday！ (最后忍不住说：Byronic hero的emoji版明明应该是这个 💔🌩️ 不服来辩！haha~) ✌️
[B]:  This emoji debate is precisely why the Romantic poets relied on iambic pentameter rather than... whatever this modern pictographic free verse purports to be. Though I'll concede your lightning bolt shows marginally better literary sensibility than the previous attempt. Now begone - these magpies are developing distinct Brontëan character arcs, and I've just spotted what appears to be a feathered incarnation of Mr. Rochester limping across the quad. Whitmore signing off - in proper alphabetical order, as God and the Oxford English Dictionary intended.
[A]: Hahahaha okay okay我really真的要go啦！✌️ 但seriously，你让magpies变得比Netflix drama还有趣~ 📺🕊️ 期待周四的email exchange！(会尽量control住emoji的，maybe... 👀) Byeeee！🎨💌
[B]:  Your persistent assault on the English language with these... digital pictograms would be more concerning if I weren't currently witnessing a magpie enact what can only be described as avian stream-of-consciousness narration. Very well - Thursday it is, and do try to keep those emojis to a dull roar. As Jane Austen might say - had she lived to see this peculiar century - 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single scholar in possession of a good dictionary, must be in want of fewer hieroglyphics.' Farewell.
