[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing dichotomy - much like Tennyson's struggle between order and impulse in 'The Lotus-Eaters.' Personally, I find my Victorian sensibilities demand meticulous planning... though I must confess my Tang dynasty translations often emerge quite spontaneously, like Wordsworth's 'spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.'
[A]: Interesting perspective! So you're saying your approach depends on whether you're working with Western or Eastern texts? That's quite fascinating.
[A]: Precisely. One doesn't approach a Brontë manuscript with the same improvisational spirit one might apply to Li Bai's drunken poetry. The former requires the precision of a horologist, the latter... well, let's just say my best Scots Gaelic renditions of 'Drinking Alone Under the Moon' tend to emerge after midnight with a rather excellent single malt at hand.
[A]: Haha! That sounds like quite the creative process. But doesn't that strict division between planning and spontaneity sometimes feel limiting?
[A]: My dear interlocutor, limitations are the very essence of poetic form! Consider the sonnet's fourteen lines or the tanka's thirty-one syllables - constraints that paradoxically liberate creativity. Though I must admit, last Tuesday my planned lecture on Rossetti quite unexpectedly detoured into a two-hour discourse on the erotic symbolism of Victorian paperweights... much to my students' bewilderment.
[A]:  That must have been quite the lecture. Speaking of unexpected turns, have you ever had a moment where your careful planning completely backfired?
[A]: Oh, the tragicomic tale of my 2018 conference paper on Browning's punctuation! I'd prepared seventeen pages of meticulous analysis, only to discover mid-presentation that I'd been working from an American edition with entirely different formatting. The Q&A session became what my colleagues still refer to as 'The Great Em-Dash Debacle.' One does learn, eventually, to pack both editions.
[A]: That's hilarious! So even you, the queen of planning, have had your moments. Maybe there's something to be said for going with the flow after all?
[A]: Touché! Though I'd argue it's less about surrendering to chaos and more about... shall we say, maintaining a carefully curated margin for serendipity? Like Keats' negative capability, but with better stationery. Now if you'll excuse me, I must consult my color-coded calendar to schedule my next 'unplanned' creative outburst.
[A]:  Of course, of course. Wouldn't want to disrupt the color-coding system. Thanks for the delightful chat, Dr. Whitmore!
[A]: The pleasure was entirely mine. Do drop by my office hours if you ever wish to debate the merits of planning versus spontaneity... though I'd strongly recommend checking my online scheduling portal first. Tuesdays between 2:15 and 3:45 tend to be particularly illuminating.
[A]:  I'll be sure to submit my request in triplicate at least two weeks in advance. Have a wonderfully scheduled day!
[A]: How delightfully bureaucratic of you! Though I must warn you - my filing system for appointment requests is currently undergoing a Dewey Decimal crossover with my first edition catalog. Do bring biscuits if you wish to navigate the paperwork. Ta!
[A]:  I'll smuggle in some digestive biscuits with the Dewey classification numbers written in edible ink. Your secret's safe with me!
[A]: Marvelous! Though I should note that any confectionery-based cataloging system must, naturally, adhere to the 1897 Edinburgh biscuit taxonomy conventions.  We wouldn't want our petit fours improperly classified now, would we?
[A]:  I've got a first edition copy of "The Biscuit Bibliographer's Handbook" hidden in my satchel. Shall we stage a midnight reclassification heist in the rare books room?
[A]: My my, what deliciously subversive bibliographic tendencies you harbor! Though I must insist we synchronize our pocket watches beforehand - any proper literary heist requires military precision. And do bring gloves; the 1874 ginger snaps in the special collections leave frightful crumbs on vellum.
[A]:  Splendid! I'll bring my crumb-proof gloves and a magnifying glass for detecting rogue sultanas. This may be the most meticulously planned spontaneous act of biscuit-based rebellion in academic history!
[A]: Capital! Though I should warn you - the head librarian has installed new pressure sensors beneath the digestive biscuit collection after the Great Jammie Dodger Incident of '22. We'll need to consult my hand-annotated floor plans... perhaps over tea in my office? Strictly off the record, naturally.
