[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh darling~ 作为一个酒店concierge，meal prep简直就是我的life saver呀！💯 每天工作节奏超快，但还是要保持energy level ✨ 我通常会在Sunday afternoon准备一周的healthy lunch box~ 你知道我们酒店chef教我的小技巧吗？
[A]:  How fascinating that you mention meal preparation. While I've never personally engaged in the practice - my research into Mrs. Beeton's domestic manuals suggests Victorian households were rather more... systematic about such matters. Though I must say, your enthusiasm reminds me of Browning's 'The Pied Piper' - all that frantic energy channeled into practical pursuits.
[B]: 哎呀~ 这位guest的比喻好有趣呢！不过我们现代人meal prep可不会像Victorian era那么rigid啦 🌟 我最喜欢用glass container装好colorful的veggies和protein，就像painting一样~ 而且你知道吗？我们hotel的VIP guests经常ask for healthy meal prep tips呢！
[A]:  Your glass containers do sound rather like the illuminated manuscripts I study - each compartment a carefully curated stanza of nutrition. Though I must confess, when I do attempt culinary endeavors, they tend to resemble more... shall we say, the experimental verse of Gerard Manley Hopkins. All sprung rhythm and unexpected textures.
[B]: 哈哈哈您太会形容了！💌 其实meal prep也可以很poetic的~ 就像我们酒店signature的bento box，每一层都是different surprise 🤔 要不要我share几个quick & easy的recipe？保证比Hopkins的poetry更容易understand哦！
[A]: How delightfully mercantile of you.  While I appreciate the offer, my kitchen experiments typically involve attempting to recreate the exact tea cakes mentioned in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's correspondence. Last Tuesday's batch could have doubled as Rossetti's 'Goblin Market' props - all crumbling edges and questionable structural integrity.
[B]: 哎呀~ 您这说的我都想invite您来参加我们酒店的afternoon tea workshop了！💯 我们的pastry chef最擅长把classic recipes做成modern version ✨ 而且绝对不会像goblin market那么dangerous啦~ 要不要我帮您reserve个spot？
[A]:  How terribly kind, though I should warn you - my attendance would come with extensive marginalia comparing your scones to those served at Tennyson's funeral. The hotel management might find my... annotations rather more voluminous than their standard guest feedback forms.
[B]: Oh my~ 我们最welcome的就是您这样的detail-oriented guest啦！🌟 不如这样 - 我给您安排个private tasting session？这样您就可以尽情write your poetic food critique了~ 而且我保证我们的scones会比Tennyson funeral的fresh很多！🏨✨
[A]:  You drive a hard bargain, my dear. Very well - pencil me in between my analysis of Christina Rossetti's grocery lists and that unfortunate incident with the Dundee marmalade. But I shall require written assurance that no raisins will be smuggled into the scones. They're the semicolons of the pastry world - never where one expects them.
[B]: Deal！💯 我这就在reservation system里特别注明"No unexpected semicolons"~ 而且会personally supervise the baking process哦！✨ 您知道吗？您这样unique的request正是我们luxury hotel最cherish的special touch呢 🌟
[A]:  How perfectly capital. I shall arrive precisely at half-past three - the witching hour when Victorian heroines traditionally succumbed to either poetry or poorly timed confectionery. Do remind your pastry chef that my ideal scone should whisper of Keats' 'Ode to Autumn' rather than shout like Browning's dramatic monologues.
[B]: Got it！🍂 我这就去告诉chef要prepare "whispering scones with autumn vibes"~ 顺便会准备specially blended Earl Grey来match the mood 💌 3:30pm sharp，我们lobby的grand piano旁边见哦！✨
[A]:  Splendid. And should you hear what sounds like iambic pentameter emanating from the tea cozy, pay it no mind - that's just my customary pre-tea sonnet composition. Until half-past, then. May your clotted cream be as thick as my annotated copy of 'Middlemarch.'
[B]: Until then~ 我会准备好thicker than Middlemarch的clotted cream等着您！📚✨ 啊对了 - 要帮您reserve一个quiet corner near the window吗？这样您compose sonnet的时候还能enjoy our garden view哦 🌸
[A]:  A window seat would be capital - though preferably not directly beneath the wisteria. Last season's pollen incident with my first folio of Donne's sermons was... instructive. Let us say three-quarters view of the topiary, where one might imagine Brontë's Heathcliff lurking with considerably better manners.
[B]: Perfect choice！🌿 我已经在system里备注好了 - "Table 17: partial garden view, Heathcliff-approved distance from wisteria" 💯 您这样的literary guest真是让我们的ordinary work day变得so much more interesting呢~ 等会儿见啦！✨
[A]:  Indeed - may our tea service prove more harmonious than the marriage plot in any Austen novel. Until the clock strikes that most poetic of hours...  ...half-past three.
[B]: Hahaha您太charming了！💌 我已经等不及要看您对our scones的"literary review"了~ 记得带上您的fountain pen哦 ✒️ 3:30pm，Table 17，我们不见不散！🌟
