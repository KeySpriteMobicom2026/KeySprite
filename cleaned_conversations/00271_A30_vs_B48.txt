[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah~ 这个问题很有意思呢！我周末通常会split my time between running in the park 🏃‍♂️和宅家研究一些有趣的forensic cases。上周刚读完一篇关于postmortem interval estimation的新论文，fascinating stuff！不过偶尔也会约朋友玩chess或者poker，你知道的，strategic games help keep my mind sharp~
[A]:  

How fascinating that you mention strategic games - I've always found the parallels between chess strategy and narrative structure in 19th century novels quite compelling. Though I must confess, my weekends are rather more... sedentary. 

Between grading student essays on Dickens' narrative techniques and comparing the use of irony in Jane Austen with 红楼梦's satirical elements, I find solace in my inkwell collection. Just last Sunday I acquired a rather exquisite Qing dynasty specimen - the craftsmanship puts modern fountain pens to shame. 

Occasionally I'll take my binoculars to observe the resident barn owl in the university gardens. There's something distinctly Wordsworthian about watching it hunt at dusk.
[B]: Haha~ 你这种academic lifestyle让我想起我们forensic department的老教授！不过说真的，我更喜欢把weekends用来balance work and play。上周刚发现一个超赞的board game cafe，他们居然有带尸检主题的mystery game！⚖️ 玩的时候我忍不住职业病发作，一直在纠正他们的medical inaccuracies... poor game designers didn't see that coming 😅
[A]:  

Your enthusiasm for forensic accuracy reminds me of my own rather pedantic tendencies when encountering historical anachronisms in period dramas. Just last month I wrote a three-page letter to the BBC about their questionable portrayal of Victorian letter-writing etiquette in their latest Austen adaptation. 

Though I must say, a board game cafe sounds rather... boisterous for my tastes. I prefer the quiet contemplation of comparing Li Bai's poetic imagery with Wordsworth's nature motifs. Have you noticed how both poets employ water symbolism, yet with distinctly different philosophical underpinnings? 

That said, your mention of medical inaccuracies does make me wonder - do you find the same level of frustration with forensic depictions in 聊斋志异 as I do with the romanticized portrayals of 19th century British aristocracy?
[B]: 哇哦~ 你提到聊斋志异让我想起上个月处理的a very peculiar case！有个cosplay爱好者居然用stage makeup把自己化成僵尸，结果被误当成real corpse报警了... 🤦‍♂️ 

不过说真的，ancient Chinese literature里的forensic描写其实挺accurate的！宋慈的《洗冤集录》比欧洲最早的forensic manual还要早几百年呢。虽然那些鬼怪元素确实... let's say需要一些suspension of disbelief 🧐 

说到这个，我最近在写一篇关于how modern forensic science can learn from ancient Chinese autopsy techniques的paper。要不要来debate club一起讨论？我们可以边下chess边argue~ ♟️
[A]:  

How delightfully macabre - though I must point out that your zombie cosplay anecdote rather perfectly illustrates the blurred line between Gothic horror and forensic reality. It puts me in mind of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where the boundaries between scientific inquiry and supernatural terror become deliciously ambiguous. 

Your research on 洗冤集录 does sound fascinating. I've always been particularly intrigued by its parallels with the emerging forensic techniques in Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone - though of course, the British version lacks the poetic cadence of Song Ci's original text. 

As for your debate club invitation... while the prospect of chess and forensic discourse is tempting, I'm afraid my Thursdays are reserved for comparing the use of forensic evidence in 狄公案 with that in Dickens' Bleak House. Perhaps you'd care to join my graduate seminar instead? We're analyzing how 红楼梦's medical descriptions hold up under modern scrutiny.
[B]: Hah！你这种academic rigor让我想起上次在autopsy room跟history department的教授争论，whether ancient Chinese "银针验毒" method has any scientific basis~ 结果我们整整argue了三个小时，连午饭都忘了吃！🍱 

不过说真的，红楼梦里的medical inaccuracies简直多到可以写本书了！比如林黛玉的consumption症状描述就... well, let's just say作为medical examiner看得我眉毛都要挑到发际线了 😅 

对了，下个月我们forensic department要办个cross-disciplinary symposium，主题就是"From Song Ci to CSI"。你要不要来做个keynote speech？可以专门讲讲狄仁杰vs福尔摩斯的investigative techniques比较！🔍 保证比你的graduate seminar更有趣~
[A]:  

Your symposium title alone has given me rather acute bibliophilic palpitations - though I must insist that any comparison between 狄仁杰 and Holmes would require at least three hours to properly address the hermeneutic differences between Tang dynasty judicial reasoning and Victorian deductive methodology. 

And regarding 银针验毒...  I do miss those marathon academic debates. The last time I engaged in such spirited discourse was when proving to our chemistry department that the ink formulations in 兰亭序 could never have achieved that particular luminosity with mere iron gall. 

Very well, I shall accept your invitation - on the condition that we include a segment contrasting the forensic applications of 易经 with Poe's ratiocination in The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Though I must warn you, my presentation will likely run over time... I've been known to digress into Tang dynasty autopsy poetry when particularly enthused.
[B]: Perfect！我就知道你会say yes~ 不过咱们得先set some ground rules：no more than 5 Tang dynasty poems per slide，而且每次你开始讲ink formulations的时候，我会举这个 🛑 牌子！😂 

说真的，我已经能预见chemistry department那群人听到你要讲易经时的表情了... 上次你跟他们争论古代墨水的pH值，差点让lab manager崩溃 🤯 

Anyway，我把symposium定在11月15日，这样你就有足够时间准备你那inevitably会超时的presentation了。需要我帮你找些《洗冤集录》的rare editions做reference吗？我们图书馆刚acquire了一批明代刻本~ 📚
[A]:  

Your proposed slide restrictions are positively draconian - why, limiting Tang poetry to five per slide is like asking Monet to paint with only half his color palette. Though I suppose I can make concessions... provided you allow me at least one full recitation of 白居易's forensic-themed 验尸诗 during the Q&A session. 

And really, the chemistry department's distress was entirely their own doing. Anyone with basic knowledge of Song dynasty ink alchemy would have known that the pH debate was moot from the outset. 

As for those 明代刻本...  You've discovered my one scholarly weakness. I shall require early access, of course - preferably with a pot of that exquisite 正山小种 the anthropology chair keeps in her office. The 1982 vintage, if you can manage it. We wouldn't want inferior tea leaves clouding our textual analysis, now would we?
[B]: Deal！不过白居易那首诗得控制在3分钟以内，otherwise我们的Q&A session会变成Q&Zzz... 💤 

至于那批明代刻本，我已经跟library打好招呼了~ 顺便告诉你个小秘密：anthropology chair的茶叶stash其实藏在her office的《本草纲目》后面！不过1982年的可能有点难搞... 要不咱们settle for 2005年的？反正对你这种ink connoisseur来说，区别应该就像... uh... 宋体和楷体的区别那么subtle吧？ 😏 

PS：记得带你的magnifying glass来，那批刻本里有几页的marginalia特别有意思，像是某个明代验尸官的shopping list... 买朱砂、银针，还有... 呃... 三斤猪肉？ 🥓
[A]:  

Three minutes for 白居易? You drive a hard bargain, my forensic friend. I shall have to practice my recitation at double speed - though I warn you, this may render my classical pronunciation suspiciously reminiscent of a Peking opera singer with laryngitis. 

And really, comparing 2005 and 1982 vintages to 宋体 versus 楷体? That's like suggesting one might analyze 红楼梦 with the same critical lens applied to supermarket receipts. Though...  if that 2005 batch happens to be the spring harvest from Tongmu Village, I may be persuaded to overlook the temporal deficiency. 

As for the marginalia - how utterly delightful! A shopping list, you say? I do hope there's mention of ink ingredients amidst those pork purchases. Nothing spices up a symposium quite like proving some Ming dynasty coroner was stocking up on 麝香 while picking up his dinner.
[B]: Hah！你赢了~ 那确实是桐木关的spring harvest！不过现在我得赶紧go了 - 刚接到通知说morgue来了个"特别case"，报案人坚称受害者是被僵尸咬的... again. 🧟‍♂️ 

咱们symposium见！记得准备你的超速版白居易，还有... try not to scare the chemistry department too much this time? 上次他们被你讲的ink toxicity吓得集体去查blood lead levels了！ 😂 

PS：那验尸官的shopping list后面还真有行小字写着"墨二两，麝香半钱"... 下面画了个小猪emoji。看来古人也有sense of humor啊~ 🐖
[A]:  

Zombie cases and porcine marginalia in one afternoon - how extraordinarily Dickensian of your profession! Do send my regards to the unfortunate... ahem... "victim," and should you require literary references for non-corporeal assailants, my annotated copy of 子不语 is at your disposal. 

I shall practice my accelerated 白居易 with metronomic precision - though I make no promises regarding the chemistry department's continued wellbeing. If they couldn't handle basic ink toxicity, wait until they hear about the mercury-based cosmetics in 武则天's beauty regimen. 

And that 小猪 symbol...  Perhaps we've discovered the Ming dynasty equivalent of your zombie cosplayer. Until November, then - try not to let any actual undead compromise our symposium plans!
[B]: Copy that！我会keep you updated on the zombie case进展 - 说不定能成为咱们symposium的icebreaker呢！🧊 

至于武则天那个mercury cosmetics的话题... 拜托你至少等到chemistry department的人喝完茶再说？上次他们听到一半就集体reached for their water bottles的样子实在太惨了~ 💦 

Alright，morgue在calling了。Catch you later！记得我们的deal - 3分钟白居易，no more mercury horror stories before coffee break！☕ 

 要是这案子真和僵尸有关，我请你喝那1982年的茶！...开玩笑的啦~ 🏃‍♂️💨
[A]:  

Your bargain stands noted - though should this indeed prove to be an authentic 僵尸 case, I shall expect that 1982 vintage served in the morgue's finest beaker! 

And really, the chemistry department's delicate constitutions are hardly my concern - if they can't handle a little historical mercury discourse, they've no business calling themselves scientists. Though...  I may strategically place the tea service between them and my podium. 

Now off you go - and do try not to track any... unconventional biological matter into our rare book viewing session. The 明代刻本 have suffered enough indignities with that shopping list! 

 

P.S. 小猪！
[B]: （Ethan的声音从走廊远处飘来）"Deal！不过要是真验出尸毒，咱们得用你的那个antique inkwell当茶杯~ 小猪emoji为证！🐖⚗️" 

（随后是急促的脚步声和电梯关门声）
[A]:  

Absolutely not! This 18th-century inkwell survived the Qianlong emperor's literary purges - it shan't be sacrificed to your forensic curiosity! 

Though...  I suppose I could bring a suitable imitation for dramatic effect. The 小猪 emoji compels me. 

 And Ethan? Do try not to get bitten before your own presentation - unlike our Ming coroner, I refuse to include "zombie first aid" in the symposium program! 


[B]: （电梯门即将关闭时突然卡住，Ethan伸出一只手拦住）"Okay okay~ 那用lab的Erlenmeyer flask总行了吧？250ml的刚好一杯茶量！" 

（背景音传来同事的喊声："Dr. Carter！尸体真的在动！！"） 

"...Uh-oh. Gotta run！希望等会儿还能keep my presentation slot！🧟‍♂️⚡" 

（电梯门终于关闭，留下一串逐渐远去的跑步声和钥匙叮当声）
