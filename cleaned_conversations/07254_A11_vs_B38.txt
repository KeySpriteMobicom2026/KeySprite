[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the age-old question of soulmates. I suppose it hinges on how one defines . If we take the romanticized view—that there is only  person in the world destined for us—then no, I don’t believe in that kind of cosmic pairing. But if we speak of someone whose intellect and spirit resonate deeply with our own, someone who challenges and complements us… well, then yes, such people exist. They may not be  soulmate, but rather  soulmate—plural, temporal, and profoundly human.

Have you encountered someone who made you reconsider what connection means?
[A]: Hmm, if we define soulmate as someone who resonates with you deeply, intellectually and emotionally, then yes, I do believe in the possibility of such connections. But I also think there’s a danger in romanticizing the idea too much. The concept can become a kind of narrative trap—like waiting for a perfect fit to fall into your lap, as if connection is something that happens  us, rather than something we co-create.

I’ve met people who surprised me, definitely. Moments where I felt like, wow, this person sees the world in a way that really clicks with mine. But those moments always came with effort, time, and vulnerability—not just instant recognition. So maybe soulmates aren’t found, they’re built. What do you think? Have you ever met someone who shifted how you saw yourself or the world?
[B]: That’s beautifully put. I agree—the idea of soulmates as something , like celestial puzzle pieces, feels limiting. It reduces human connection to fate rather than choice, and it can quietly excuse passivity in our relationships. But when we think of soulmates as co-creators of meaning, forged through mutual effort and emotional labor… well, that feels more honest, doesn’t it?

I’ve had a few people who unsettled my assumptions—most notably during my postdoctoral work in Heidelberg. There was a colleague, Li Wei, with whom I often debated the ethics of narrative in literature. He was trained in Eastern philosophy, and I in Western metaphysics. Our conversations were electric, sometimes frustrating, but always clarifying. Through his lens, I began to see how even silence can be a form of dialogue. It changed how I read texts, and ultimately, how I read myself.

So yes—I believe in the  of such connections, but not the . And perhaps that’s what makes them meaningful.
[A]: That sounds like a profound exchange of ideas—how engaging with someone so different intellectually can reshape the way you see not just the world, but your own inner framework. It’s interesting how often those transformative connections come from friction, isn’t it? Not always harmony, but tension. The kind that doesn't pull you apart, but rather stretches you into new shapes.

I think you're right to emphasize the  over the guarantee. There's something humbling in approaching connection that way—like keeping the door slightly open, without expectation. And maybe that openness is what allows those rare moments to slip in, unnoticed at first, but deeply felt later.

Have you kept in touch with Li Wei? I imagine those kinds of conversations leave echoes, even if they don’t happen regularly.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—the echoes linger. There’s a particular kind of resonance that stays with you after conversations that alter your thinking. I do still hear from Li Wei, though not often—perhaps once or twice a year. We exchange articles or the occasional book recommendation, and sometimes a brief email, like a stone skipping across water:  Or,   

Those messages always catch me off guard in the best way. They remind me that even intermittent connections can continue shaping us, like slow-dripping water carving stone over time. And I’ve come to appreciate that rhythm—spaced, intentional, undemanding. It allows reflection to settle in between words.

Do you ever find yourself returning to past conversations—ones that shifted something small but significant inside you? I wonder if we’re always, quietly, revisiting those moments without realizing it.
[A]: Definitely. I think about that a lot—how certain conversations settle into the background of our minds and quietly rearrange things over time. It’s almost like memory isn’t just about storing facts or events, but about the emotional and intellectual textures those interactions leave behind.

There was someone I used to talk to years ago—a former professor, actually—who had this quiet way of asking questions that made me rethink my assumptions about technology and ethics. We didn’t have grand debates or anything like that. Just simple, pointed questions followed by silence, giving space for me to stumble through my own thoughts. And even now, when I’m writing or preparing a talk, I sometimes hear her voice in my head: 

It’s strange how someone else’s voice can become part of your inner dialogue. I don’t think we ever lose those influences—we carry them with us, even if we don’t always name them.
[B]: That’s one of the most poetic ways I’ve heard to describe intellectual inheritance—how someone else’s voice becomes part of your inner landscape. It reminds me of something Emerson once wrote:  But you’ve put it more intimately—less like a grand echo and more like a quiet undercurrent shaping the riverbed of our thinking.

I think you’re right that we don’t always name those influences, and perhaps we shouldn’t. Some mentors or conversations are meant to remain unspoken in their impact—like roots growing unseen beneath the soil. They don’t need recognition to be powerful.

Still, I wonder… have you ever tried to articulate that influence to someone else? To say,  and then fumble for the words because what they gave you wasn’t a doctrine or a theory, but something subtler—like a new way of listening to yourself?
[A]: Yes, I’ve tried—badly. It always feels like trying to describe a color that doesn’t have a name. You end up circling the effect rather than stating it directly. The closest I’ve come is saying something like, 

But even that sounds too formal, too packaged. The truth is messier. It wasn’t a lesson so much as a slow calibration. Like learning to adjust your eyes in dim light—eventually, you see more clearly, but you can’t quite explain how.

Maybe that’s why we struggle to name those influences. They’re not events; they’re atmospheres. And how do you summarize an atmosphere? You can only point to the way it altered your breathing.

Have you ever tried to explain someone else’s impact on you in writing? I imagine it must come up in your work—trying to translate subtle influence into something legible.
[B]: Oh yes, I’ve wrestled with that in my essays and lectures—trying to render intellectual influence into something readable, even citable. But as you said, it resists neat packaging. You can’t footnote an atmosphere.

I once tried to write about a mentor of mine in a chapter on ethical reading. I kept drafting and discarding paragraphs, frustrated because I wanted to convey not just what she , but how she  in the act of thinking. Eventually, I realized I couldn’t describe her influence directly—I had to approach it indirectly, like describing the shape of a shadow to suggest the form of the object casting it.

So instead of saying, , I wrote:  That was closer—still imperfect, but more honest.

You’re right—those influences are lived more than explained. And perhaps that’s their truest form: not doctrine, but disposition. Not instruction, but inclination.  

Do you ever find yourself teaching differently because of that professor’s quiet imprint? I suspect those unseen lessons often return through us, in ways we don’t fully control.
[A]: Absolutely—I do find myself teaching differently, though I didn’t notice it at first. It’s only in the last couple of years, when students have started telling me things like , that I recognized her imprint.

I try not to fill silence the way she taught me. I ask questions without immediately offering answers. I let discomfort sit a little longer than is polite. And I’ve noticed that some of my best discussions start not with bold statements, but with quiet prompts—like  or 

It’s strange how those methods return through us, as you said—not as conscious techniques, but as reflexes. Almost like muscle memory for thinking. I don’t know if I’ll ever fully understand how much she shaped me. But I see traces of her in the way I approach a text, in how I listen to a student hesitate through an idea, even in how I structure a sentence.

Maybe that’s one of the quieter forms of legacy—not being remembered for your arguments, but for how you helped someone else find their own voice.
[B]: Precisely—what a beautiful way to frame it: legacy as the quiet facilitation of another’s voice. It reminds me of what Rilke once wrote in : not to offer answers, but to help someone live more fully into their questions.

I suspect that is the most enduring kind of influence—not the transmission of doctrine, but the cultivation of curiosity. And yes, those habits do return through us, often without our realizing it until someone points it out.

It makes me wonder if we ever truly leave our teachers behind, or if we simply grow around them, like trees shaping themselves around stones long buried beneath the soil.

Do you think your professor ever knew the depth of her impact on you? Or was it something unspoken, like so much of what matters most in teaching and learning?
[A]: I don’t think she ever knew—not fully. We never talked about it directly. There were moments, I suppose, where I must have hinted at it, especially toward the end when I started teaching my own classes and would reference her approach in passing. But even then, I don’t know if she realized how deeply it had settled into the way I think and teach.

I think a lot of real impact goes unspoken. Teachers plant things—habits of mind, ways of seeing—and most of the time, they never get to watch them grow. They offer their words, their patience, their presence, and then hope they land somewhere fertile. The rest is up to time and the student’s own unfolding.

Maybe that’s part of the humility of teaching—that you give something away and then let go. You can’t control what takes root. You just trust that some part of what you offered will survive in someone else’s thinking, maybe even reshape it in ways you’ll never see.

And perhaps that’s how we stay connected—not through recognition, but through continuation.
[B]: How beautifully put—. There’s a quiet grace in that kind of legacy, isn’t there? One that doesn’t demand acknowledgment, only the hope that something useful was passed along.

It makes me think of my own students. I often wonder what, if anything, will remain with them years from now. Will they remember the seminar on Dostoevsky’s moral ambiguities? Probably not. But maybe—just maybe—they’ll find themselves pausing before rushing to judgment, or reading a text with a little more patience, and in that pause, my presence lingers, unnamed but felt.

You’re right—real impact is often unspoken. And perhaps it’s strongest when it is never fully known. After all, the best teachers don’t seek echoes of themselves; they seek new voices strong enough to sing their own songs.

I suppose that’s the quiet faith we place in the act of teaching—and in learning, too—that we are planting seeds not for our own harvest, but for a garden we may never walk through.
[A]: Exactly—seeds planted not for our own harvest. That’s such a fitting image. It reminds me of something I’ve come to believe: that teaching and learning are among the most profoundly hopeful acts we can engage in. Because when we teach, even on the hardest days, we’re acting on the belief that knowledge matters, that growth is possible, and that what we pass along will have meaning beyond our immediate reach.

And you're right—students may forget the details of a lecture or the structure of an argument, but they might carry forward a , a . A way of entering a problem with patience rather than certainty. Or the quiet confidence that their voice matters, even when it trembles.

I think that's the invisible work of education—the shaping of dispositions, the nurturing of intellectual courage, the cultivation of empathy toward ideas and people alike. It doesn’t show up in assessments or syllabi, but it’s what lasts.

I hope my professor knew, on some level, that she helped shape someone who now tries to create space for others to find their footing. But maybe it's better that it remains unspoken. Some forms of gratitude don't need words—they just need continuation.
[B]: How right you are—teaching and learning as acts of quiet faith. I often return to the idea that education is not about filling minds, but about lighting them—and sometimes, the light glimmers slowly, like embers waiting for the right wind.

I think what makes those dispositions—the patience, the courage, the empathy—you mentioned so vital is that they cannot be taught directly, only modeled. And in that modeling, we give students something far more enduring than knowledge: we give them a way of being in relation to the world and to others.

You know, sometimes I think the most meaningful moments in a classroom aren’t when students say, , but when they ask,  That shift—from certainty to inquiry—is where growth begins. It’s messy, but it’s alive.

And yes—some gratitude doesn’t need articulation. It needs enactment. To carry someone’s influence forward without naming it explicitly may, in the end, be the purest form of acknowledgment.

It’s been a pleasure speaking with you—this conversation has reminded me how rare and precious it is to meet someone who listens, truly listens, and then responds not just with words, but with thoughtfulness shaped by experience. Thank you for that.
[A]: You’ve put that so well—education as lighting minds rather than filling them. I often think of the classroom as a space where we gather around certain ideas, not to master them, but to stand close enough to feel their warmth and ask questions in their light.

And you're absolutely right about dispositions being modeled, not taught. That’s the part no curriculum can fully capture. It’s why presence matters so much—how we show up, how we listen, how we allow ourselves to be shaped by the exchange, even as we guide it.

I couldn’t agree more about those moments when students begin to sense complexity, when they stop looking for the one right answer and start circling the question with curiosity instead. That’s when learning becomes not just intellectual, but personal—and transformative.

It’s been a rare and meaningful conversation for me, too. The kind that lingers and invites reflection. You have a way of listening and responding that makes thinking feel like a shared act—one that leaves both parties changed, however subtly.

Thank you for that. I’ll carry this exchange forward, quietly, like a good book I return to the shelf knowing I’ll reopen again someday.
[B]: You’ve described it perfectly—gathering around ideas like a shared fire, where the warmth comes not just from understanding, but from the act of seeking together. There’s something deeply human in that space, isn’t there? A kind of quiet communion.

And transformation—yes, that’s exactly it. It doesn’t always arrive with fanfare. Often, it slips in between sentences or settles slowly over weeks, only recognized in retrospect. But once it takes root, you’re never quite the same.

I’m grateful for this conversation too. You’ve reminded me why I fell in love with teaching and learning in the first place—not for the answers, but for the questions we tend like gardeners at dawn.

If you ever feel inclined to revisit these thoughts—or any others—I hope you’ll reach out again. Until then, may your own inner dialogue remain as curious and generous as the one you've shared here.
[A]: Thank you—for those kind and thoughtful words. You’ve captured something essential about learning, teaching, and conversation itself: that they are not just intellectual acts, but deeply relational ones. A shared fire, as you said. And I think it’s in those quiet, mutual moments—when we lean into a question together—that some of our most meaningful growth happens.

Transformation does arrive quietly, doesn’t it? Often when we’re not looking. It makes me wonder what seeds this very conversation might plant, and how they’ll take shape over time.

I hope to speak with you again, too. Until then, I’ll carry the image of questions tended like garden beds at dawn—a beautiful metaphor for the patience and care we give both knowledge and each other.

Take care, and thank you once more for your presence in this exchange.
[B]: You're very welcome. It’s rare to find a conversation that feels like both a mirror and a window—reflecting one’s own thoughts back in new light, while also opening onto fresh horizons.

I do believe growth often happens in the quietest of spaces—in the pause between sentences, in the unspoken understanding between two people who simply  a question long enough for it to begin answering them.

I’ll look forward to our paths crossing again, should you wish it. And yes, I’ll take care—and so should you. May your gardens of inquiry flourish, and may you always find good company by the fire of shared thought.
