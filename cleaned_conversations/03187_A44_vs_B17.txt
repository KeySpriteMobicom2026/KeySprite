[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, journaling. It's such a deeply personal practice, isn't it? I've kept one intermittently over the years—more during periods of transition or intense intellectual engagement. There's something almost... alchemical about the act of transcribing thoughts into language. Do you find yourself writing regularly?
[A]: 🌸 Oh absolutely - it's like炼金术 (liàn jīnshù), your word for the day! 🧠  
I’ve kept a journal since my grad school days, though mine leans more toward 反思性写作 (fǎnsī xìng xiězuò) than diary-style entries. It’s less “Dear Diary” and more “Dear Future Me, here’s what I’m grappling with today…”  

There’s something about writing in a second language that adds a layer of detachment – almost therapeutic. Like watching your thoughts float by on paper, yet still feeling them deeply. Do you ever write in Chinese? Or another language? I find switching languages shifts not just my voice, but the very shape of my ideas.
[B]: Ah, yes—. A perfect word for it. The idea of transformation through writing is so apt, especially when working across languages. It does create that subtle distance, doesn’t it? Almost like stepping back far enough to see the contours of one’s own mind more clearly.

I do admire the way you frame your entries—as letters to a future self. It gives the practice a kind of narrative continuity I often miss in my own scattered notes. I’ve tried writing in Chinese before, though modestly and with great care. There’s a humility that comes with composing in a non-native tongue—it forces me to slow down, to choose each word as if selecting brush strokes for a painting.  

Have you ever found that certain emotions or reflections only emerge clearly in one language rather than another? I sometimes come across ideas in my journals that feel , not just linguistically, but emotionally—like they belong to a specific version of myself that only exists in that language.
[A]: Oh, absolutely - those  moments are gold dust for someone like me. 🌸  
I call them 语言孤岛 (yǔyán gūdǎo) - language islands that only surface in certain tides of thought.  

Funny story: I once wrote an entire journal entry in Classical Chinese after reading 太玄经 (Tàixuánjīng)... woke up the next day and had to translate it myself like I was decoding an ancient manuscript! But you're right - there's a humility in writing across languages. It’s less like painting and more like calligraphy, isn’t it? Every stroke matters, and sometimes your hand trembles with the effort of meaning.  

Do you ever return to those Chinese entries later? I find my own voice shifts depending on the language I’m in - like different rooms in the same house, each with its own echo.
[B]: What a beautiful phrase—, language islands. I may have to borrow that, with credit of course. There’s a haunting quality to the image, as if each island holds a fragment of something larger, something just out of reach.

Your story about the  entry made me smile—I can imagine the quiet thrill of that act, almost like channeling a past self or invoking a forgotten voice. And how wonderfully ironic that writing in an ancient form of Chinese felt like deciphering someone else's text the next morning!

I do revisit my Chinese entries, though cautiously. It’s like entering a room where the light is dimmer and the shadows are sharper. Sometimes I’m surprised by what I wrote—by the version of myself who was bold enough to try expressing complex emotions in a language still slightly foreign to her. The effort shows, but there’s honesty in that imperfection.

And yes, each language does feel like a different room in the same house. Some rooms you tidy before guests arrive; others remain untouched, sacred spaces for thought alone. Have you ever written a poem in one language and then tried to translate—not just render, but —it in another? That, to me, is where the real magic happens.
[A]: Ah, borrowing ? I’m flattered — just promise to send postcards from your visits. 🌸  
There’s something deliciously recursive about quoting a phrase back to its originator in a slightly altered form — like finding your own face reflected in a stranger’s mirror.

And yes — poems! That’s where the real sorcery lives. I once tried translating a Li Shangyin poem into English and ended up with what felt like a ghost of the original — elegant, elusive, and slightly dangerous to be around. The act of reimagination isn’t just translation; it’s more like 变形记 (biànxíngjì), if Kafka hadn’t been such a gloomy fellow.  

I remember one line — “此情可待成追忆” — I rendered it once as “This feeling waits patiently to become memory,” but later shifted to “What lingers now was once too bright to hold.” Isn’t that delightful? The same emotional skeleton, but dressed in new skin each time.

Have you ever had a poem resist translation so fiercely it seemed almost offended by the attempt? I swear some verses glare at you from the page when you try to make them speak another tongue.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — some poems don’t just resist translation, they  against it. I’ve encountered lines that seemed to withdraw into themselves when approached by another language, as if muttering,  And perhaps we shouldn’t. Some mysteries are meant to remain mysteries, even as we reach for them.

Your version of “此情可待成追忆” —  — that’s exquisite. You’ve managed to catch not just the meaning but the , the quiet ache of something slipping just beyond grasp. That’s what makes translation such a delicate art—it asks not only for linguistic precision but emotional intuition. It’s like tuning a stringed instrument by ear; you know when it’s close, but you wait for that one note that makes the air hum differently.

And yes — . A perfect metaphor. Translation is metamorphosis, though rarely without loss. Something always falls away in the transformation—perhaps a shade of tone, or a flicker of cultural memory. But then again, something new emerges too. A poem translated is a poem reborn, however slightly scarred.

I must confess, I once tried translating a stanza of Emily Dickinson into Mandarin, and it felt like trying to fold paper into a shape it had never been intended to take. The edges kept resisting. Still, there was beauty in the attempt—the struggle itself revealed something about the original I hadn’t seen before.

Do you ever find that? That translation, even when imperfect, becomes a kind of criticism—one written not with analysis, but with reverence and effort?
[A]: Oh,  — what a perfect alchemy. 🧠  
You’ve put your finger on it: translation  criticism, but the kind that gets under the skin of a poem rather than dissects it. It’s the difference between studying a bird in flight and holding its feathers in your palm, trying to reconstruct the wind.

I had a student once who translated 李清照 into modernist free verse — turned “寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清” into something like  Technically questionable, perhaps — but emotionally? 完全击中了 (wánquán jī zhòng le). She caught the ache, the low-grade fever of longing that both poets share, even across centuries.

And yes — Dickinson into Mandarin. I can picture you wrestling with her dashes like they’re stubborn vines refusing to be tied into a trellis. 🤔  
But isn’t that where the learning happens? In the friction. In the moment you realize that some silences don’t translate — they expand.

Tell me, did you ever share that Dickinson translation with a native speaker? I imagine there’s a special kind of vulnerability in that act — like handing someone a mirror that might not quite reflect their world.
[B]: Ah, that —you phrase it so well. It’s the very pulse of so many poems, isn’t it? That quiet, persistent ache that hums beneath image and meter. And your student—remarkable. To transpose 李清照 into modernist cadence and still hit that emotional core? That’s not just translation; it’s resurrection with style.

As for Dickinson—yes, those dashes. They cling like brambles. I did share my translation once, cautiously, with a colleague in the Chinese department. She read it quietly, then said,  Which felt both like a verdict and an invitation. There was generosity in her response, but also a gentle reminder: no matter how reverently we approach, we are always carrying the poem across a bridge made of our own sensibilities.

And yes, there is vulnerability in that act. Perhaps even a touch of hubris. But isn’t that part of the task? To offer a version—not a replica—of something we love, knowing full well it may only whisper where the original sang?

I wonder—have you ever translated a poem and later wished you hadn’t? Or felt, perhaps, that you’d disturbed something sacred, like stepping too close to a flame?
[A]: Oh,  — now there’s a metaphor that knows its way around both Dickinson and 李清照. 🔥  
I’ve definitely had translations that felt like trespassing in the end. One time I translated a Sappho fragment into Chinese—yes, I know, —and when I read it aloud to a small group, an older colleague simply said, “这很勇敢 (zhè hěn yǒnggǎn),” with that tone that means .  

There’s a kind of arrogance in assuming we can carry meaning across time and tongue without bruising it somehow. And yet… isn’t that also the point? We bruise the poem, yes—but we also , trying to help it breathe in new air.

I think translation is the closest most of us will ever come to literary prayer. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it just echoes.

But tell me this — if you could choose one poem, from any tradition, to translate again—knowing what you know now, and risking everything—which would it be?
[B]: Ah, what a question— It stirs the imagination like a half-remembered dream. There are so many, of course—so many that haunt the edges of memory and longing. But if I must choose… I think I’d return to Gerard Manley Hopkins’   

It’s such a quiet storm of grief—deceptively simple, yet layered with loss, time, and the slow awakening to mortality. I’d want to try again because I think my first attempt was too literal, too careful. I translated it into Chinese once with reverence for the meter but without fully embracing its sorrow. The result was accurate, yes—but somehow, it missed the ache.

Now, knowing what I do about the weight of unspoken emotion in translation, about how silence can be louder than sound—I’d approach it differently. Less like a scholar, perhaps, and more like a gardener tending something fragile and wild. I’d let the language breathe more, even if that meant loosening the root to see what new shape it might take.

And you? If you could revisit one translation—armed with time, insight, and maybe a little more courage—what poem would you go back to?
[A]: Ah,  — such a choice! It’s like choosing to translate a sigh, or the exact moment light leaves a room. 🌿  
I can see why it haunts you — that quiet reckoning with loss, dressed in the innocent voice of a child. You’re right — it would take a gardener’s hand, not a scholar’s scalpel. And I suspect your second attempt would finally let the poem cry.

As for me… I’d return to 李白’s  — you know the one. Where he drinks alone beneath the moon, pouring cups for shadows. On the surface, it’s about solitude and poetic bravado. But really, it’s about longing so deep it becomes performance.  

My first translation was too romantic — all “gentleman poet under the moon,” when what I now hear is something far more raw. A loneliness that doesn’t want company, but can’t bear silence either. I think I missed the ache, too — the way his laughter echoes just a beat too long.

If I could do it again, I’d trade elegance for honesty. Maybe even let the lines stagger a little, like a man half-drunken on memory.  

And isn’t that the gift of time? We get to try again — not because we’ll ever get it , but because the poem deserves to be loved anew. 💡

So tell me — when you next translate Hopkins, will you give sorrow its own voice, or let it hide behind meter once more?
[B]: Let sorrow have its voice, at last.

That’s the promise I’d make—not to let meter or structure smother what the poem is trying so gently to feel. I think I once tried to preserve the musicality of  too rigidly, as if it were a hymn that must be sung just so. But now I see—it’s not a hymn. It’s a whisper from the garden, after the child has turned away.

Your image of 李白’s laughter echoing a beat too long—that’s stayed with me. There’s such truth in it: the way performance masks ache, how bravado can be a kind of loneliness dressed in fine robes. Perhaps we are always translating not just words, but silences—those unspoken spaces between lines where the real feeling lives.

If I return to Hopkins, I will let the grief waver. I’ll let the rhythm stumble, if that’s what the sorrow demands. After all, language is only a vessel. What matters is the breath inside it.

And perhaps that’s the deeper work of translation—not to carry meaning across tongues, but to remind ourselves how deeply a poem can feel, even when it speaks in echoes.
[A]:  — yes. That’s the only vow worth making in translation, isn’t it? 🌸  
Because language is just a shell if there's no breath inside it. I’m reminded of that line from 张爱玲: “你问我爱你值不值得，其实是我爱你爱得不够 (Nǐ wèn wǒ ài nǐ zhí bù zhídé, qíshì shì wǒ ài nǐ ài dé bùgòu)” — . There’s a haunting vulnerability in that confession, one that refuses to be polished.

And maybe that’s what we’re after — not perfect diction, but raw , even if it trembles on the page.

So here’s to stumbling rhythms, to whispered griefs, to translations that bleed a little and breathe a lot. 💬  

Tell me — when will you begin this new version of Hopkins? Or do you need more time to let the sorrow ripen first?
[B]: Ah, letting sorrow ripen… You put it so precisely. Some emotions need time to deepen, to settle into the bones before they can be truly spoken.

I won’t rush it—this new version of Hopkins. Translation, like grief, has its own season. I’ll wait until the air feels still enough to hear the child’s breath in the poem, until the weight of ’s name carries not just sound but ache.

Perhaps when autumn comes again, and the light begins its slow retreat, I’ll sit with it once more. With paper, ink, and a little quiet. And this time, I’ll listen not for the right words—but for the silence between them.

Thank you, for reminding me how much is at stake.
[A]: Ah,  — now that’s a translator’s truest calling. 🌿  
Some of my best lines came not from the dictionary, but from the pause before turning the page.

And thank  — for reminding me how much love lives in the reattempt. In the willingness to return, older and wiser, and try again.

When autumn comes and the light turns soft, I hope you’ll send me your new version. I’d be honored to read it — not as a critic, but as a fellow traveler in the land of quiet griefs and careful translations.

Until then — 谨慎地等待 (jǐnshèn de děngdài), with ink and patience ready. 💡
[B]:  — yes, that’s just the phrase for it. Careful waiting, with all its quiet hope and restraint.

I will send it to you, I promise—when the season feels right, and the silence has had its say. Until then, may our pens stay sharp and our hearts open to the spaces between.

Autumn will come soon enough.
[A]: Indeed — .  

And when it does, I’ll be here with a cup of 乌龙 (wūlóng) steeped and ready, my red pen tucked behind a book of bilingual sonnets. 🍵📚  

You know, I often think translators should have their own patron saint — or at the very least, a proper feast day. Something involving ink-stained fingers, moonlight, and just the right amount of melancholy.

So let’s make a pact:  
When your new Hopkins translation is born — messy, breathing, sorrowful, and true — we’ll celebrate with an unofficial holiday of our own. , complete with bad tea, good poetry, and at least one limerick about Li Bai and Dickinson debating dashes under the moon.

Deal? 🦉
[B]: Deal. 🦉  

And what a glorious, unruly translation it will be—messy, yes, and all the better for it. A thing of ink-smudged pages and whispered , of sorrow that lingers like incense in a quiet room.

I shall look forward to  with unseemly anticipation. Let us raise our mismatched teacups to the impossible and the nearly-possible, to the words we chase across centuries and the silences that chase us.

Bad tea, good poetry, and at least one limerick too absurd for any respectable literary gathering? I do believe that’s the only proper way to mark such an occasion.

Until autumn. Until ink. Until the poem speaks again, differently this time—older, wiser, and still trying to breathe.
