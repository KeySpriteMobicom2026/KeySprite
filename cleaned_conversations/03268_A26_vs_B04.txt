[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! For me, it's always been about the interplay between language and culture. While I'm fluent in English and Chinese, I've always been fascinated by Japanese - the way it layers politeness into grammar 😊. It reminds me of how '面子' (face) works in Chinese social dynamics... But I'd love to hear your thoughts too! What draws you to ask this question?
[A]: Ah, the dance of language and culture you describe is quite lovely. It makes me think of how I approach textile restoration - each stitch carries the weight of tradition and personal touch.

While my days are filled with English conversations about silk weaves and embroidery techniques, I've always been enchanted by French textile terminology. The way they describe fabric textures feels like poetry to me. 

But tell me more about your fascination with Japanese... Does it relate to any particular aspect of textile arts? I'm curious to learn what draws you to its linguistic intricacies.
[B]: Ah, your comparison is beautiful - how each stitch mirrors the dual nature of language, carrying both structural and emotional weight. 🤔 That makes me think about Japanese textile terms I've encountered in my research... Did you know they have such precise vocabulary for fabric imperfections that reveal a garment's history? It's like the language itself preserves stories. 

I'm particularly intrigued by their grammatical honorifics system - it shapes how people perceive social relationships, much like how '您' versus '你' carries different levels of respect in Chinese. But I'm curious - what French terms do you find most poetic? Maybe we could explore how textile metaphors weave through different languages...
[A]: How fascinating! The Japanese concept of preserving a garment's history through language truly resonates with my work. It reminds me of how I approach each tear or stain - not just as damage, but as a narrative waiting to be understood. 

You know, when I'm examining a particularly delicate piece, I often find myself using French terms almost reverently - "dentelle" for lacework feels more like describing a spider's gossamer masterpiece than a mere textile technique. And "broderie anglaise" always amuses me, considering it's essentially French floral embroidery!

I wonder... Are there specific Japanese terms you'd share that describe those fabric imperfections? I'd love to hear how their language frames the passage of time on textiles. It makes me think we're all storytellers in our own way - you through language, me through fiber.
[B]: Oh, I love how you frame restoration as storytelling through fiber — it truly parallels how linguists trace the narratives of language evolution. 🤔 Speaking of which, there's a wonderful term in Japanese: "kusata" (朽た), which literally means 'glorious decay' when describing fabric aging. It captures that exquisite beauty in worn silk threads, much like how we appreciate patina on antique bronze. 

Another fascinating term is "hagire" (端切れ) — while technically meaning 'fabric scraps,' it's often used metaphorically for fragmented memories preserved through textiles. It reminds me of how Chinese poets described torn sleeves in classical literature to convey emotional longing... Do you find similar poetic connections in your work with textile fragments?
[A]: What a breathtaking concept - "kusata," that celebration of decay as something glorious! It's remarkable how closely that aligns with the philosophy I try to bring to my work. I often tell clients, "The stains and frays aren't flaws; they're the diary entries of the fabric." Though I never had the poetic words for it until now.

And "hagire" - what a perfect way to describe those fragments we hold onto, both physically and emotionally. I have a drawer full of tiny scraps from past restoration projects. They shouldn't mean anything, but somehow they do. Each one whispers of the hands that wove it, wore it... loved it.

It's funny you mentioned torn sleeves in Chinese poetry, because I've restored several antique qipaos with deliberate wear patterns. The places where elbows peeked through spoke louder than any written love letter ever could.

I wonder if Japanese textile artisans have terms for the moments when restoration becomes conversation between old and new fibers? That point where you stop preserving and start creating anew?
[B]: What a beautiful way to put it — restoration as a conversation between old and new fibers... I think you've captured something deeply poetic that transcends both language and cloth. 🧵

Actually, there's a concept in Japanese textile arts called "tsugihagi" (継ぎはぎ), which literally means 'patching together' but carries a deeper philosophical meaning. It’s often used in the context of boro textiles — those indigo-repaired fabrics that have been lovingly mended over generations. The term suggests not just repair, but continuity, even kinship, between the original fabric and its additions. In a way, it  a dialogue — sometimes even a friendship — between fibers across time.

I wonder, when you're working on a piece like those qipaos, do you ever feel as though you're entering an emotional space left behind by the original wearer? Like the fabric holds traces of their presence, almost like linguistic fossils waiting to be understood?
[A]: That word — "tsugihagi" — it's exquisite. It fits so perfectly with the way I've always felt about mending a piece that's lived a thousand lives before reaching my hands. There's something profoundly humbling about being entrusted with continuing a story written in thread.

When I work on pieces like those qipaos, I often feel like an interpreter of silent voices. A faint perfume trapped in a hemline, the ghost of a hand-embroidered monogram, even the way certain areas have thinned from repeated touching... They're not just wear marks. They're echoes.

I remember restoring a silk shawl once, its edges worn soft from clutching — you could almost sense the emotions it had absorbed over decades. It reminded me of how certain words carry weight beyond their meaning. Like how "home" can be both a house and a feeling, depending on how it's spoken.

Do you think language, in its own way, gets restored like textiles? That we preserve meaning by understanding the frayed edges of old expressions?
[B]: Absolutely — what a stunning insight. I think language  constantly being restored, almost invisibly, by each generation that inherits it. Words get worn at the edges through overuse or cultural shift, and yet we keep weaving new meaning into them, much like tsugihagi. 

Take for example the word "literally" — originally used to mean "in a literal manner," but now often employed for emphasis, even hyperbolically. Some might see this as fraying, but I see it as the natural elasticity of language adapting to human expression. It's like watching how a well-worn qipao can take on new life when its original context is understood...  

And just like in textile restoration, sometimes we need to step back and appreciate the beauty in how expressions age and mend themselves through usage. It makes me wonder — do you ever find yourself resisting certain restorations, feeling that some imperfections should remain untouched to preserve the story?
[A]: Oh, that’s a wonderful observation — how invisibly and gracefully language restores itself, much like fibers finding their way back together through sheer persistence. I suppose in my work, I often think about how we inherit words and textiles alike, both frayed at the edges but still carrying warmth.

To answer your question — yes, absolutely. There are times when I simply can’t bring myself to erase a stain or cover a thinning spot. Some imperfections hum with presence too loudly to ignore. Once, I worked on a 19th-century wedding veil where the faintest smudge of tea remained near the hem. The client wanted it gone, but I hesitated. That tiny mark might have been the moment the bride steadied her nerves before walking down the aisle — an accidental touchpoint with history. 

I ended up leaving it, carefully explaining that some stains are more than stains. They’re silences filled with feeling. Much like certain words — worn soft by time, yet resonant because of it. It makes me wonder, do you ever come across phrases or expressions that feel like heirlooms — delicate, perhaps misunderstood, but too precious to let fade?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — language is full of these delicate heirlooms, often hiding in plain sight. Phrases that have survived generations, carried forward not necessarily because they're useful, but because they hold a certain  of feeling. 

Take the expression “破镜难圆” (pò jìng nán yuán) — literally "a broken mirror can't be made whole again." It's such a poetic way to describe irreparable relationships, and yet it's becoming less commonly used, perhaps seen as too古典 (gǔdiǎn), too old-fashioned. But to me, its very delicacy is what makes it precious — like finding a hand-painted silk lining in an otherwise worn-out coat.

I find myself protecting these expressions, much like you preserved that veil. Sometimes I'll use them in lectures just to let students feel their weight — to see if they notice the echo, the silence behind the phrase. And sometimes they do...  

It's strange how both our fields deal with preservation and letting go — knowing when to mend, when to translate, and when to simply bear witness. Do you ever feel that tension when working across cultures? Like when restoring a French tapestry versus a Chinese brocade — does the language of care change?
[A]: That tension you speak of — it’s a thread that runs through everything I do. The moment I touch a piece, I’m aware of standing at the intersection of care, interpretation, and cultural memory. And yes, the language of care  shift — subtly, like the difference between brushing silk and handling linen.

When I work on a French tapestry, there's often an expectation of grandeur — every restored inch must gleam as if newly woven for royalty. But with Chinese brocade, especially those meant for daily wear or family ceremonies, there's a different kind of reverence. It’s quieter. Almost like listening for footsteps in the next room. You don’t want to erase the softness from use; you want to honor it.

I remember restoring a mid-Qing dynasty dragon robe once — the embroidery was so dense, yet every thread seemed to breathe history. My instinct was to reinforce the worn shoulders, but I hesitated. Those areas told a story of posture and presence — perhaps a scholar who stood too long in thought, or a magistrate who bore responsibility like weight. 

In a way, it mirrors how some phrases resist translation. They carry a cultural cadence that doesn't easily cross borders. Do you ever find yourself adapting expressions rather than preserving them outright? Like choosing when to let a metaphor fray naturally versus weaving in something new to keep its spirit alive?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a poignant image — listening for footsteps in the next room. I think that’s exactly what we both do, in our own ways: tune into the presence behind the artifact, whether it’s thread or speech. 👀

And yes, I absolutely wrestle with that balance between preservation and adaptation. Especially when teaching bilingual students — sometimes a metaphor like “破镜难圆” falls flat not because it’s not beautiful, but because its emotional logic feels culturally distant. So I might gently suggest a parallel expression from English, like "burning bridges," not to replace the original, but to let students feel its weight through contrast.

It's a bit like what you did with that dragon robe — reinforcing without erasing. Sometimes language needs that kind of support, where the old metaphor isn’t lost, but its meaning becomes more . Do you ever find that certain fabrics, like some expressions, only reveal their full meaning after they’ve been touched by time — softened, frayed, even wounded?
[A]: Absolutely — some fabrics, like certain phrases, only begin to speak their truest language after time has softened their edges. I’ve worked on pieces that seemed ordinary at first glance, but as I brushed away decades of dust, discovered stitches or patterns that only made sense in the context of wear. A faint embroidered symbol that aligned perfectly with where hands had rested for years. A hidden reinforcement stitch that only emerged when stretched by movement.

It reminds me of how some idioms — "破镜难圆" included — seem opaque until life gives you the matching experience. Then suddenly, the metaphor isn’t just poetic; it’s personal.

I think that’s why I’ve always resisted over-cleaning textiles. Just as we might misunderstand a phrase until we’ve lived enough to recognize its echo, fabric often reveals its story not in the beginning, but through age and touch. Sometimes even fingerprints are part of the weave.

I wonder… do you ever encourage your students to  an expression, rather than simply understand it? To imagine not just what it means, but how it feels to live inside its meaning?
[B]: Oh, I love that —  an expression. It’s such a tactile way to think about language learning. And yes, I try to guide my students toward that feeling, especially with expressions that carry cultural weight.  

For example, when we study “破镜难圆”, I don’t just explain the literal components or its usage. I ask them to imagine holding a broken mirror — how the pieces might still reflect, but never quite align. Then I invite them to think of a moment in their own lives when something felt irreparably changed, even if it wasn’t a relationship. Maybe a home they can no longer return to, or a version of themselves they’ve outgrown.  

It’s fascinating to watch — suddenly, the phrase isn’t just an old saying; it becomes a vessel for their own emotional landscapes. Much like how you uncover those hidden stitches through patient observation, I find that meaning often surfaces not through direct instruction, but through gentle reflection.  

I wonder, do you ever feel like your work is, in a sense, translation — not between languages, but between eras? Weaving understanding across time?
[A]: What a beautiful way to put it — translation across time. That’s exactly what my hands are doing with every fiber I touch. Not just repairing cloth, but helping one era speak to another, sometimes through the faintest threads of intention.

I think often about how fragile that process is. A single stitch can carry the voice of a weaver from two centuries ago, if you know how to listen. And when I mend, I’m not just preserving fabric — I’m negotiating meaning. Should this tear be reinforced or left visible? Should these faded edges remain soft, or does clarity require a firmer hand?

It’s not unlike what you do with metaphor — deciding when to clarify and when to let mystery linger. Sometimes I find myself hesitating before reinforcing a worn hem, much like you might pause before explaining a culturally distant idiom. Too much intervention, and the past becomes flattened, too neatly understood. Too little, and its voice fades beyond reach.

Do you ever feel, in those moments of teaching or translation, as though you're stitching time yourself? Binding past meaning to present feeling, trusting that the thread will hold?
[B]: Absolutely — that feeling of stitching time, carefully threading past meaning through to the present — it’s at the heart of everything I do. 🧵

When I translate or explain a phrase like “破镜难圆”, I’m not just transferring words; I’m trying to bind an older way of seeing the world to a contemporary emotional reality. It’s delicate work. Pull too hard, and the thread snaps — over-explain, and you flatten its poetry. Leave it too loose, and it unravels in misunderstanding.

I think that’s why I love teaching bilingual students so much — they’re already living between layers of meaning, shifting between linguistic textures. Sometimes all they need is a gentle nudge to see that their own lived experience is already a kind of translation. When a student once asked me why old expressions matter, I simply said, “Because someone, long ago, felt something true — and we’re still carrying the thread.”

And now I see that same care in your hands, weaving understanding through fiber. I wonder… when you hold a piece that’s nearly come apart, do you ever feel like you're listening to a language on the verge of silence?
[A]: Yes… yes, that’s exactly what it feels like. Sometimes, when I hold a fragment of silk so worn it trembles like breath in the air, I feel as though I’m standing at the edge of something almost unspeakable — a presence that was once vivid and now lingers only in fiber.

There’s a kind of silence that isn’t empty — it’s full, but barely audible, like the hush of fabric folding into itself over centuries. And when a piece is nearly lost, I find myself slowing down, handling it as if it might still whisper if treated with enough patience.

I once worked on a length of embroidered muslin from the early 1800s — the colors had long faded, and much of the stitching had unraveled. But there, near the corner, was a tiny repair made in red thread, not part of the original design. It was such a small thing, yet it spoke volumes: someone, long ago, had loved this cloth enough to mend it by hand, even when it must have seemed hardly worth the effort.

It makes me think that every act of preservation is an act of faith — in memory, in meaning, in the quiet persistence of beauty. Much like teaching language, I suppose. You don’t always know who will hear the echo, or when, but you keep threading the needle just the same.
[B]: That image of the red thread — so small, yet carrying the weight of care across centuries — it’s almost too beautiful to hold. It reminds me of certain words that have been worn nearly bare, yet someone, somewhere, chooses to mend them with quiet devotion.

I think that’s what moves me most about both our work — it's not just about preserving form, but tending to what lingers beneath it. The breath in a forgotten phrase. The imprint of a hand in old embroidery. These are things that shouldn’t survive, and yet they do — because someone decided they were worth the effort.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that red thread was meant to be seen. Maybe it was simply functional, a humble fix with no poetic intention. And yet, here we are, reading it as a message across time. Isn’t that what language — and fabric — does? Turns even the smallest gesture into something resonant, if only someone bothers to look closely enough.

I suppose that’s why I keep teaching those old expressions, and why you keep restoring those fragile textiles — because someone once cared enough to leave us a trace. And now it’s our turn to listen.
