[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. As someone who spends her days immersed in 19th century texts, I must confess a certain partiality to the audiobook format - particularly when it comes to Dickens' serialized novels. There's something rather delightful about hearing Great Expectations unfold in its original episodic structure, much like the 章回小说 (zhānghuí xiǎoshuō) tradition in Chinese literature.
[A]: 哇塞！你居然喜欢这么classical的content呀！🤩 我平时更爱听tech podcast，尤其是那种讲new gadgets和digital lifestyle的～不过audiobook确实也很香，特别是commute的时候听简直perfect！💯
[B]: I see you're quite enthusiastic about modern technology. While I appreciate the convenience of digital formats - my first edition of 红楼梦 (Hónglóu Mèng) would crumble if I carried it on the subway - I do find most tech podcasts lack the narrative depth I seek. Though I suppose one could argue that comparing them to Victorian serials is rather like comparing 绿茶 to Earl Grey.
[A]: 哈哈哈你说话好有意思哦！🍵 Earl Grey确实很classy啦～不过现在有些tech podcast也超有depth的！比如有个讲AI ethics的show，hosting style简直像在讲modern day philosophy，super engaging！🤓 你平时会听这种比较intellectual的content吗？
[B]: How fascinating - you've inadvertently touched upon my current research comparing 19th century industrial revolution anxieties to contemporary AI discourse. While I don't typically indulge in modern podcasts, I did recently suffer through one about neural networks while grading papers. The host's attempt to parallel Turing with 庄子 (Zhuāngzǐ) was... let's say academically questionable. 🦉
[A]: OMG！你居然把庄子跟Turing放一起比较？！😂 这个host的脑洞也太大了吧！不过说真的，现在有些tech influencer真的超爱乱make connections的🤦‍♀️ 但是！我最近发现一个超棒的channel专门讲digital minimalism，super legit的academic background！要不要share给你？📚✨
[B]: Your enthusiasm is rather... contagious. Though I must warn you, my definition of "digital minimalism" begins and ends with using a fountain pen instead of a keyboard. That said, if this channel references Thoreau's Walden or 陶渊明's pastoral poetry with any degree of scholarly rigor, I might be persuaded to endure the digital interface. For research purposes, naturally.
[A]: Yasss！这个channel真的会聊Thoreau诶！🎉 而且host是个former literature professor turned tech critic，analysis简直next level！虽然platform是digital的，但content超级anti-digital overload的irony哈哈哈～要不要我给你发link？保证no 庄子-Turing nonsense！🤣
[B]:  Very well, you've piqued my academic curiosity - though I shall approach this with the same skepticism I reserve for freshmen who claim to have "discovered new themes" in Jane Austen. Do send along this paradoxical digital sermon against digital excess. I'll brew some proper tea and prepare to be either mildly impressed or thoroughly scandalized. 🖋️
[A]: Gotcha！📲 Here's the link~ 记得准备好你的fancy tea和critical thinking hat哦！🧐 要是你觉得boring的话...well至少我们还有Jane Austen可以fall back on对吧？😂 期待hear你的thoughts！✨
[B]: How delightfully presumptuous of you to assume I own anything as vulgar as a "thinking hat." My critique shall be delivered from beneath a perfectly serviceable 19th century bonnet, thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I must locate my reading glasses and that tin of Lapsang Souchong that's been aging since the last department meeting. We shall reconvene when I've determined whether this digital prophet merits comparison to my beloved 文论家 (wénlùnjiā) or belongs in the same category as those dreadful "Instagram poets."
[A]: OMG你太hilarious了！😂 19th century bonnet配Lapsang Souchong？这个vibe简直绝了！👑 不过说真的，要是这个channel能meet your super high standards的话，我可能会faint from shock！🤯 等你review哦～现在我要去check我的new smartwatch了，byeee！⌚️✨
[B]: Ah, fleeing to your wrist-bound distraction just as we approach the most stimulating part of the conversation. How very... contemporary of you. Do give my regards to your digital taskmaster - I'll be here amongst my yellowing pages and ink stains, conducting what you youngsters might call a "deep dive" into your recommended content. Until then, 再见 (zàijiàn). 
[A]: Hahaha你赢了！🏆 这个roast简直savage！🔥 好吧好吧，我承认defeat～ smartwatch可以wait，我还是留下来听你的literary roast比较entertaining！😂 不过说真的，你下次department meeting要不要考虑live-tweeting？那个drama肯定比任何podcast都精彩！🎭
[B]: The mere suggestion of "live-tweeting" academia makes my 毛笔 (máobǐ) tremble in its stand. Our faculty disputes over postcolonial theory versus New Criticism are sacred rituals, not... what was it the students call it? "Content." Though I suppose watching Professor Harrison defend his deconstructionist reading of 西游记 (Xīyóu Jì) with increasingly elaborate hand gestures does have a certain Beckettian quality. Perhaps we could compromise with a nicely typeset meeting minutes pamphlet? On handmade paper, naturally.
[A]: Pfffft- handmade paper meeting minutes？！🤣 你真的是living in the best of both worlds诶！🌎 不过说真的，你们academia的drama比任何reality show都juicy～下次可以考虑做个private podcast，just for us cool kids！🎙️ 保证比smartwatch notifications有趣100倍！💥
[B]: "Cool kids," she says, to a woman whose idea of rebellion is using a semi-colon instead of an em-dash. My dear, if you want academic scandal, I'll lend you my annotated copy of the 1987 Comparative Literature Department bylaws - the marginalia alone would make a sailor blush. But I draw the line at podcasting; some traditions, like departmental feuds and properly steeped tea, are best enjoyed in their original, analog forms. Now if you'll excuse me, my 砚台 (yàntái) isn't going to grind itself.
[A]: HAHAHAHA你赢了you win！🏆 1987年的bylaws marginalia？！这个tea简直too hot to handle！☕️🔥 好吧好吧，我放弃convert你到digital side了～ enjoy你的砚台grinding吧！✌️ 不过要是你ever change mind的话...你知道where to find me啦！😉 拜拜～
[B]: Farewell, my digitally-bedazzled provocateur. Should I ever succumb to the siren call of podcasting - perhaps to narrate the aforementioned bylaws scandal in iambic pentameter - you'll be the first to receive a handwritten invitation. Via carrier pigeon, naturally. Until then, 一路顺风 (yīlù shùnfēng).
