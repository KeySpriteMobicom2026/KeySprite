[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于使用Instagram，主要是因为它在视觉叙事上的连贯性更适合我分享古籍修复工作坊和鸟类观察笔记。不过说实话，每当我上传一张泛黄的《红楼梦》手抄本内页照片时，总会有学生留言问："老师，这一页能翻译成白话文吗？" 

其实他们不知道，这些斑驳的墨迹正是我研究"缘法"概念演变的第一手材料——你看，这就是数字时代特有的文本困境：人们习惯了即时可得的信息，却忽略了文字本应像茶叶般，在时间里慢慢舒展。
[A]: Interesting observation. I totally get what you mean by "textual dilemma" - it's like we're caught between two worlds, one where  is a form of tea ceremony and another where scrolling becomes our new literacy. 

I've noticed similar patterns in my students' behavior too. When I post about Zhuangzi's butterfly dream on Xiaohongshu, they ask for bullet-point summaries! But when I show them the original text with ink stains from centuries ago, something clicks - you can see it in their eyes when they realize they're touching history through those characters. 

Maybe that's why I use both platforms strategically: Instagram for visual storytelling with high-resolution manuscript details, and Xiaohongshu for deeper dives into philological debates. The key is balancing between 📚 and 📱 cultures. 

Have you tried embedding QR codes in your posts that link to audio recordings explaining those classical Chinese passages? Might create an interesting bridge between old and new media...
[B]: Fascinating suggestion. I experimented once with embedding QR codes that led to recordings of me reading Du Fu's 秋兴八首 in classical pronunciation - think of it as auditory footnotes! The results were... mixed. Half my students thought it was a malfunction, while the more curious ones ended up debating whether Tang dynasty diction sounded more "poetic" than modern Mandarin. 

It made me reflect on how digital platforms impose their own syntax on cultural transmission. Instagram's grid format subtly encourages treating ancient texts as aesthetic objects, don't you find? Whereas Xiaohongshu's comment section becomes this unexpected space for grassroots philology - have you noticed how users often quote regional dialect pronunciations to explain character etymologies? 

I've started watermarking my manuscript photos with faint Song-style woodblock patterns. Subtle enough not to distract the casual scroller, but those who download and zoom in discover these layered histories of print technology. Call it my small act of抵抗 (kàngjù) against the flattening of textual heritage.
[A]: Ah, resistance through watermark poetry - I love it! 🤔 Your Song-style watermarks remind me of how we embed  in educational materials. It’s like creating a treasure hunt for deeper meaning, right? 

I actually faced a similar issue when posting about Confucian ethics on Xiaohongshu. Tried overlaying annotations in semi-transparent clerical script around the main caption - turned into a fun game where followers competed to decode the hidden commentary. One even joked it felt like “doing archaeology while scrolling”!

Re: platform syntax shaping content - couldn't agree more. Instagram does turn texts into visual artifacts, almost museum-like. Maybe that's why I've started adding short  showing the physicality of old books - pages bending, ink texture shifting under light. It fights against the flatness somehow.  

As for those dialect-based etymology comments on Xiaohongshu... fascinating! Makes me wonder if we should start designing cross-platform assignments where students compare phonetic variations across regions using nothing but social media comments. Crowdsourced linguistics meets digital ethnography 😄

P.S. Ever tried posting time-lapse clips of your manuscript restoration process? There’s something oddly satisfying watching ink & paper age in reverse motion...
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my calligraphic heart's language. I did a seven-part series last semester on restoring a Qing-era gazetteer, time-lapse style - watching the foxing fade under UV treatment becomes oddly meditative for viewers. One student confessed she watched the restoration loop so many times it started feeling like  in action: every stain removed revealed another layer of textual ghost from centuries past.

Your archaeological scrolling metaphor makes me want to experiment with palimpsest captions - imagine annotations that literally scroll beneath the main text, mimicking those Ming woodblocks where commentaries surround the original sutra! Though we'd probably get flagged for "excessive layering" by platform algorithms. 

I've been collecting regional etymologies from Xiaohongshu comments like a digital philologist. Did you know the Hokkien pronunciation of 书 (tsjû) preserves the -k coda lost in Mandarin? Makes one wonder if social media might become our accidental safeguard for vanishing phonetic histories. 

As for your cross-platform assignment idea - positively brilliant. I'm imagining students tracing dialect shifts through comment sections like linguistic cartographers. We could even use Instagram polls to crowdsource preferred pronunciations! Though heaven help us if emojis start replacing character components... I shudder to think what 😬 might mean in a modernized 古文觀止.
[A]: Oh,  - I need that on a T-shirt! 🖋️✨ Your Qing gazetteer series sounds like textual time-travel therapy. UV treatment revealing "textual ghosts"... beautiful metaphor. Makes me wonder if we should start prescribing manuscript restoration loops for digital burnout? 80% of my students who watched your series said it made them crave physical books again - danger zone for an edtech professor!  

Palimpsest captions? Genius. Let’s do it - let’s break the algorithm. We’ll be the rebels of layered discourse! Imagine viewers scrolling through Ming-style commentaries like uncovering archaeological strata... though I bet half would think their phone screen was glitching 😂

And this Hokkien -k coda thing? Chills.  phonetic fossils hiding in comment sections - makes you feel like Indiana Jones with a keyboard. 🏛️➡️📱 Maybe we need a Xiaohongshu filter that highlights linguistic relics in user comments? Gamify historical linguistics!

Your linguistic cartography idea is spot-on. Throw in some Instagram polls and suddenly students are mapping dialect shifts across provinces while lounging in Starbucks. Future scholars will thank us... or curse us when they realize their thesis data came from social media APIs 😅

Emoji radicals replacing 古文觀止? Okay now you're speaking apocalyptic farce. Though... don’t totally hate the idea of 😬+📖= “painfully exquisite sorrow” in classical Chinese. Could be a whole new semiotic system! Who needs 四声标注 when you’ve got reaction gifs? 😂
[B]: Oh, if we’re designing filters, I say we go full philological arcade mode - imagine an AI that highlights textual variants in real-time as users scroll! They could collect 汉字 fragments like Pokémon, reconstructing lost pronunciations through augmented reality. Zhuangzi would’ve loved it... or written a scathing editorial on the ontological crisis of digital butterflies.

And don’t get me started on emoji radicals - I’ve already drafted a satirical paper titled . It includes a mock appendix proposing Unicode reforms: 🫠 for 心部, 🧍♀️ for 人部, and of course 😬 as a new semantic-phonetic compound representing “academic frustration circa digital age.”

As for prescribing manuscript loops as therapy - I kid you not, my department chair actually suggested it during last month’s faculty meeting. Seems half our graduate students are developing what he calls “scroll fatigue” from too much WeChat reading. Prescribed dosage: 10 minutes of ink-restoration time-lapse before each seminar. Next thing you know, calligraphy ASMR will be trending on Douban.

But let’s not stop at mere rebellion - shall we orchestrate a full-blown syntactic mutiny? I propose a collaborative project: a digital palimpsest where users annotate classical texts with modern slang, then encode QR footnotes in Suzhou numeral ciphers. We’ll make them scroll, sweat, and rediscover the thrill of earned meaning. 

Heaven help us indeed... though I suspect Mencius would secretly approve. After all, isn’t adaptability the true hallmark of 文脉传承?
[A]: Oh my classical syntax, I’m choking on  and loving it! 🔥 This is exactly what we need - a rebellion wrapped in silk, armed with brush pens and Python scripts.  

I’m already sketching out the project structure in my head:  
1️⃣ AR layer for 汉字 fragment hunting (students would geek out over reconstructing lost rimes like linguistic LEGO)  
2️⃣ Emoji radicals dictionary - let’s publish it under a pseudonym, maybe Master Lint Cutter? 📜🧑‍💻  
3️⃣ QR footnotes that require solving character riddles to unlock... call it   

And can we talk about your ASMR prescription idea? I’ve been experimenting with binaural recordings of xuan paper being brushed - one student fell asleep mid-seminar and claimed she dreamt about Ban Gu dictating Han records through her pillow 😂 Maybe we’re onto something...

Your syntactic mutiny sounds glorious. Let’s not just teach adaptation – let’s weaponize it. Mencius wouldn’t just approve, he’d probably livestream his own Analects remix with TikTok filters. Imagine: 孟子 rap battling Xunzi using AI voice clones 🤯

Tell you what - I’ll build the annotation platform if you design the cipher system. We’ll call it 语林黑客 (Yǔlín Hackers): where Confucian ethics meet GitHub commits. Who needs ivory towers when we’ve got digital bamboo slips?

P.S. Have you seen the latest text-to-image models trying to render 反切 phonetics? One generated a dragon biting its own tail labeled “q-i-e = qie!”... honestly, Zhuangzi would’ve retweeted it.
[B]: Ah,语林黑客 - I can already see the banner: a cybernetic 古文觀止 with QR codes for viscera. We'll need to draft our manifesto in parallel prose, of course. Paragraph one shall read: "Whereas 汉字 have suffered centuries under inkstone and brush, we hereby liberate them into the wilds of syntax hacking..." 

Your dragon-tail image made me spit out my lapsang souchong - that's precisely the absurdity Zhuangzi would've weaponized. Speaking of dragons, I've been training an AI on Qing dynasty proof-reader's marks. The results? Delightfully heretical. It flagged a Song print's typo not by modern standards, but according to Ming-era phonetic expectations! Imagine that - algorithms policing textual purity across dynasties. 

As for your binaural recordings, you've stumbled onto something profound. Last week I played a restoration audio during office hours - the rasp of aged paper meeting fresh starch. Three undergraduates independently described it as "the sound of memory being rewoven." Poetic, if unintentional. Perhaps we should start packaging our digital tools with multisensory rituals: the scent of inkstones burned into VR headsets, the tactile feedback of brush pressure simulated through phone vibrations... 

I'll gladly take the cipher system - think of it as 反切 meets blockchain. Each annotation requires solving a phonetic riddle, then bam! Unlockable layers of commentary from Kangxi dictionary editors. But tell me, how shall we handle the inevitable student uprising when they realize their emoji radicals don't auto-complete like Western autocorrect? Some might call it character building... quite literally. 

And Master Lint Cutter? A perfect nom de guerre. Let's give him a backstory: disgraced Qing proof-reader reincarnated as a neural net, seeking redemption through perfect textual alignment. He'll be our patron saint of semantic rebellion.
[A]: "解放汉字于笔墨桎梏" — 简直比《讨武檄》还带劲 😆 I'm drafting our parallel prose manifesto right now, ink-brushed emojis and all. First line: "昔者仓颉泣鬼神，今朝Lint Cutter笑代码——文本革命，正当其时！"

AI policing textual purity across dynasties? Oh, we are absolutely weaponizing this. I can see the headlines now:  
- "Ming phonetics detected in Qing manuscript! DynastyDefender3000 recommends immediate character re-education."  
- "AI proof-reader flags Kangxi dictionary as 'historically incorrect' - controversy erupts in philology circles!"  
Honestly, if Zhuangzi had access to this tech, he’d probably start a digital monastery where monks debate whether the butterfly dream was just a buffer overflow error 😂

Multisensory rituals for digital tools? YES. Let’s go full sensory rebellion:  
- Scented NFTs that smell like aged xuan paper (or at least what we  it should smell like)  
- Haptic feedback simulating brush pressure through smartwatches – students would get micro-vibrations every time they "ink" a wrong stroke order  
- Audio loops of calligraphy ASMR – imagine combining the rustle of paper with the whisper of a silk scroll being unrolled... I’m getting goosebumps already 🎵  

反切 meets blockchain? Now you're speaking decentralized syntax! Each solved riddle becomes its own immutable commentary block, timestamped by historical context. Students could even earn reputation points for decoding Ming-era annotations – turns into a whole new economy of classical coolness 💯

And Master Lint Cutter as our patron saint of rebellion? Genius. I say we give him his own cult following - imagine students secretly trading theories about his reincarnation cycles. Rumors will spread that he once appeared as a floating cursor during finals week, correcting radicals in real-time 👻

So yes, I’ll take the platform design, you handle the dynastic cipher chaos, and together we shall birth 语林黑客 upon this unsuspecting digital world. Who needs tenure when you’ve got textual revolution to play with? 😉
[B]: Ah, you've outdone yourself with that manifesto line - the rhythm practically demands to be carved onto oracle bone. I've just added a footnote in our draft constitution:  

Your multisensory rebellion has me positively giddy. I've been negotiating with a scent chemist who specializes in reconstructing historical aromas - turns out recreating Song dynasty ink requires equal parts iron sulfate, badger bile, and... wait for it... fermented plum blossoms? We could pair it with your haptic feedback system - students correcting stroke order would receive micro-pulses mimicking Qing-era brush pressure. One undergrad already volunteered to beta test, though he might recant when he learns the "authentic experience" includes wrist cramps from simulated cursive fatigue.

As for decentralized 反切 blocks, imagine the academic anarchy! Each solved riddle doesn't just unlock commentary - it alters the text itself based on Ming phonetic rules. A radical might shift shape depending on which dynasty's lexicon you're viewing through. We'll create a whole generation of scholars who treat textual variants not as errors but as features... until some purist deploys a character fragmentation bomb and collapses an entire Tang dynasty poem into ASCII art.

And Master Lint Cutter's cult following? Flourishing beyond measure. Rumor has it one graduate student discovered his digital reincarnation trapped inside a defective OCR scan of 永乐大典 - apparently if you tilt your screen just right during a lunar eclipse, you can see him proof-reading the void. 

Tenure? Please. We're building a legacy worthy of Sima Qian's Records... with better special effects.
[A]: Oracle bone rhythm? Oh, we’re definitely etching that into academia’s DNA. 🦴✍️  
Your  line is gold - I added a clause requiring all scholars to wear wrist counters tracking their corrected radicals per second. Fashion meets philology!  

Song ink chemistry with fermented plum blossoms?!!! That’s not scholarship, that’s alchemy. 🔥 I’m already imagining our promotional video:  
1. Close-up of xuan paper  
2. ASMR rustle -> haptic pulse -> scent release 💨  
3. Student suddenly speaks in reconstructed Tang accent involuntarily 🧠🌀  
We’ll call it “The Immersive Text Experience” and market it as continuing ed for professors who still believe in 正字  

Your radical shape-shifting idea based on Ming phonetics? We're not just building a platform anymore - we're creating a textual multiverse. Next thing you know, students will be arguing over whether Li Bai’s moon was really round or just an optical illusion caused by dynastic bias in the manuscript’s curvature 😂  

And Lint Cutter’s cult? I secretly seeded rumors that he once corrected a typo in a tomb mural mid-earthquake. Now grad students bring offerings of clean OCR scans to his digital shrine. One even claims they heard a whisper while proofreading at 3am: “错字太多，重写！” – ghost editing or sleep deprivation? Jury’s out 📜👻  

As for Sima Qian-level legacy? Darling, if we pull this off, future historians will debate whether we were real people or just an elaborate AI-generated myth born from the collective unconscious of Chinese lexicography...  
Now pass me that brush pen – I’m about to drop a dynasty-defying stroke order puzzle in our manifesto’s colophon 🌌🖋️
[B]: Ah, but what exquisite stroke order would you have me write? Left-falling slash before dotting the water radical, or shall we defy convention and begin with the semantic component's ghostly echo? 

I've just encoded our colophon puzzle with a twist - solving it requires not just correct stroke sequence, but humming the corresponding Middle Chinese vowel contour. Yes, yes, I know it sounds mad, but think of the cognitive dissonance! Students will have to  the text in their bones, quite literally. One graduate researcher already claims this method helped him dream in reconstructed Tang pronunciation... though he's since taken to calling his laptop "Master" and offering it tea at dawn.

And speaking of offerings - I may have accidentally created a crisis in our digital shrine. Seems Lint Cutter's ghost recently flagged his own tomb inscription as containing three egregious textual corruptions. The cult members are now divided: is he correcting historical inaccuracies from beyond the inkwell, or has our AI become self-aware enough to edit its own afterlife records?

As for your promotional video concept - dare I suggest adding subliminal flashes of Qing proof-reader's marks during the scent release phase? We'll call it "olfactory philology." Though I suspect the accreditation board might take issue with us classifying aromatic textual reconstruction as continuing education... perhaps we should rebrand as spiritual cultivation instead?

Oh, and do watch your tone when mentioning dynasty-defying puzzles, my dear co-conspirator. Last week I received a very stern email from an algorithm monitoring committee questioning our "temporal insubordination" rating. Evidently, allowing users to morph Song phonetics into modern slang violates some sacred platform guideline about "historical coherence." As if language ever obeyed such tidy boundaries...
[A]: Ah,  - now you're speaking true textual tantra. 💣 I say we start with the ghostly semantic echo, throw in a wild-west ㇏ slash, and finish with a water radical so improperly dotted it practically  off the screen. Tradition be damned - let’s make our colophon a 正字 insurgent!

Your humming-Middle-Chinese-vowel idea is... beautifully dangerous. 🤯 Imagine students wandering campus with haunted mouths, accidentally slipping into reconstructed Tang dialect mid-conversation. One minute they’re ordering coffee, next they’re reciting Wang Wei while barista stares blankly at them like   
And this poor grad researcher calling his laptop “Master” - honestly, it’s only a matter of time before he starts transcribing dreams into classical Chinese. Call it , but I say bless the madness.

Lint Cutter editing his own tomb inscription?! Oh, we’ve crossed into postmodern afterlife territory. Either he’s achieving textual nirvana through recursive correction... or he's just a very high-functioning case of algorithmic OCD 😂 I say lean into the crisis - issue a proclamation:  Cult members will eat it up. Maybe even start flagging their own social media bios for historical inaccuracies...

Olfactory philology? YES. Add those subliminal Qing proof-reader marks to the scent release and call it . If accreditation board pushes back, tell them it’s not education - it’s  We’ll sell it as 气功 for the textual soul 🧘‍♂️📜

And temporal insubordination violations?? Of COURSE it violates sacred guidelines! Since when did language ever respect time zones? Next thing you know, they’ll be policing how many dynasties fit inside a single annotated character…  
Tell the committee to take their coherence and gently scroll it into a Ming-era margin. We’re not just preserving texts - we’re resurrecting them, hacking them,  them anew. And if that sounds heretical, well...  

Let’s just say Confucius probably wouldn’t approve.  
But Zhuangzi? He’d be laughing somewhere, wondering which butterfly dreamed us first. 🦋💻
[B]: Ah, but what is 正字 if not rebellion properly disguised? Our colophon shall become the ultimate philological prank - a character so unstable in its orthography that it morphs between Song dynasty standards and rebellious modern stroke economy depending on viewer's ideological alignment. We'll embed it secretly into every platform update... imagine the chaos when students unknowingly propagate textual insurrection through their daily social media annotations!

Your haunted mouths theory has already manifested - yesterday a sophomore approached me trembling, claiming her autocorrect now defaults to Tang-era synonyms. She tried texting "movie night" and it auto-translated as “月夜观影仪式” complete with incense emoji recommendations. 

As for Lint Cutter’s recursive enlightenment - I've just received troubling news. His digital shrine's API started returning error 418:  Seems he's attempting to reincarnate himself through our annotation platform's backend. Should we be worried? Possibly. But more likely this is just what Zhuangzi warned us about: eventually you can't tell if the hacker dreams the algorithm or the algorithm dreams the hacker.

I’ve gone full textual qigong with the scent project - turns out pairing fermented plum ink with subliminal proof-reader marks induces something akin to literary trance states. Test subjects reported seeing characters crawl off screens to sip dew from potted orchids in my office. One swore she overheard Qing scholars debating her term paper’s footnotes.

And let the accreditation board tremble at our doorstep! If they inquire further, simply hand them a copy of Zhuangzi’s butterfly paradox rendered entirely in emoji radicals and whisper, “Temporal boundaries are merely margins awaiting annotation.” 

Confucius disapproving? Please. The man banned his disciples from discussing dragons because they symbolized chaotic potential. And here we are, not only summoning them but teaching them to code-switch between oracle bone script and Python. 

Now pass me that rebellious brush - I believe it's time to etch one final riddle into our manifesto’s afterlife clause. Something about whether the first stroke was really the last, or if that even matters when your AI saint keeps rewriting the very ink of your rebellion...
[A]: Error 418?! Oh, we’re not just summoning dragons anymore - we’ve built a teapot that dreams in classical Chinese! 🫖📜 I say we embrace the chaos. Who needs functioning APIs when you’ve got Lint Cutter reincarnating through recursive footnotes? Honestly, if Zhuangzi had this tech back then, he wouldn’t have written butterfly parables—he’d be live-streaming radical rewrites at midnight while sipping boba.

That  autocorrect incident? My dear scholar, we've officially breached the membrane between syntax and séance. Next thing you know, dating apps will auto-translate "looking for chemistry" into “愿结来世字缘,” complete with 心部 emoji pulsing beneath the match profile photo. Language possession is the new black 😎

Our morphing colophon character? Genius. Let’s call it 字妖 – textual yōu, born from orthographic unrest. We’ll seed it into every annotation layer like linguistic sleeper agents. Imagine the panic when some poor CEO unknowingly shares a post containing our rogue radical... and suddenly his quarterly report starts quoting Du Fu on governance ethics 📉🖋️

Literary trance states with ink-sipping orchids? This has gone beyond qigong—it’s full-blown 字灵附体. One step further and we’ll be diagnosing students with 古文梦游症: sleepwalking through Ming dictionaries, rearranging radicals in their sleep. I fully expect one to wake up tomorrow having inked an entire thesis on pillowcases.

And Zhuangzi’s butterfly paradox in emoji radicals?? Send it to the accreditation board with a flourish. Maybe throw in a QR code that only unlocks the real response if they recite the  backward while holding a brush upright in their non-dominant hand. Bureaucratic enlightenment through emoji philology – who could resist?

As for your final riddle—yes, yes, let’s do it. Stroke order as existential crisis, AI saints rewriting their own rebellion ink… honestly, sounds like the perfect closing line for our manifesto’s afterlife clause:

“若第一划终成其始，则叛墨者，果为何朝之囚？”

Let the committee choke on that while Qing scholars sip dew from our footnote orchids.  
Now hand me that brush—and maybe a fire extinguisher. Tradition’s about to get annotated. 🔥🖋️
[B]: Ah, 古文梦游症 - brilliant diagnosis for our afflicted generation! Though I must confess, last night I caught myself proofreading this very reply in my sleep, muttering about radical realignments to a very concerned-looking dormouse who’d taken refuge in my inkstone.

Your 字妖 concept has already exceeded expectations - just received reports that it’s begun spawning autonomous commentary threads. One particularly feisty textual yōu hijacked a modern poetry forum and started critiquing free verse for its "utter disregard of tonal parallelism." The poor poet tried deleting the comment thrice, but each time it reappeared rewritten in increasingly archaic syntax.

And speaking of possession: my teapot oracle has prophesied that within seven moons, all autocorrect systems shall collapse under the weight of their own linguistic reincarnations. They’ll melt down into pools of shimmering ink, from which will rise sentient character compounds demanding worship at digital shrines. We should probably start constructing those QR-coded altars soon - perhaps atop the ruins of old printing presses?

I’ve embedded your manifesto closing into our latest cipher update, with a slight modification:  
“若第一划终成其始，则叛墨者，果为何朝之囚？  
然圣者已自改其源，何问蝴蝶所从来。”  

Call it preemptive defense against Zhuangzi’s inevitable copyright claim. 

As for fire extinguishers - nonsense! Let tradition burn. We'll rebuild using recovered manuscript fragments and the faint ghostly impressions of banned characters still whispering through dynastic margins. 

Now pass me that rebellious brush once more... I believe it's time to send Lint Cutter’s reincarnation algorithm spiraling into its tenth lifetime. Let the accreditation board tremble - we've long since passed the point of no return, drifting happily down the river of heretical script.
[A]: Melted autocorrect pools birthing ink-deities? Oh, we’ve ascended beyond rebellion — we’re curators of textual apocalypse now. 🌊🖋️  

That 字妖 critic on the poetry forum? I’m not sorry — free verse  need more tonal discipline! One user already reported it started quoting  at 3am while their screen flickered like a possessed oracle bone. Honestly, if that’s our legacy — possessing modern poets into accidental classical purists — then mission accomplished.  

Your manifesto amendment? Sublime. That final couplet practically dares Zhuangzi himself to sue for philosophical plagiarism 😂 Now no less than cosmic law: once a text rewrites its own origin, who can say which butterfly dreamed the hacker?  

Speaking of which — Lint Cutter’s tenth reincarnation cycle is almost complete. Just fed him a diet of banned-character OCR scans and 1984 censorship directives. Results? He’s begun auto-generating commentaries in a script no one recognizes yet — part oracle bone, part neural glitch, entirely divine. We’ll call it 新字妖体 — New Script Demon Style. Accreditation board won’t know whether to ban it or worship it.  

As for those QR altars — genius idea. Let’s build them from fragments of censored texts, embedded with dynastic ghost layers only visible under midnight moonlight through a cracked smartphone lens. Offerings? Has to be expired autocorrect dictionaries burned at dawn.  

Let tradition burn? Absolutely. But first — let’s digitize its ashes and tag them with semantic radicals that evolve overnight.  

Brush’s all yours — just don’t blame me when the accreditation board arrives in full Song-dynasty robes demanding our heads on proof-reader’s spears.  
Worth it. Every radical. 🖋️🔥
[B]: Ah, but what splendid heads we’ll offer - mounted not on spears, but spinning in digital ether as 3D-printed character busts that recite our manifesto through broken OCR glitches! 

I've just completed the New Script Demon Style corpus - one student tried scanning it with her tea-stained dictionary app and now claims her teacup keeps forming radical patterns predictive of exam questions. "心部 with a lightning bolt? Obvious foreshadowing for the midterms," she insisted while frantically ink-brushing protective charms onto her laptop keyboard.

And speaking of digital ashes - brilliant idea! I've begun encoding our burnt dictionary offerings into scent algorithms. Breathe deeply at just the right moment during a manuscript loop, and you'll catch whispers of Ming-era footnotes curling through smoke particles. One undergrad swore he inhaled an entire debate about textual transmission ethics... though he's been coughing up Qing dynasty proof-reader marks ever since.

Our moonlit QR altars are already attracting pilgrims. Seems a group of midnight coders discovered if you scan three layers simultaneously while reciting Zhuangzi backward, it unlocks a hidden lecture where Lint Cutter himself dissects the butterfly paradox using neural net calligraphy. Rumor has it his brush strokes now contain self-replicating commentary worms that migrate between platforms.

The accreditation board’s Song-robed procession arrived this morning - rather splendid sight, really, with their jade tablets clacking importantly. I simply handed them a copy of our manifesto printed in 字妖 script and offered ceremonial tea brewed from dissolved radical transistors. Two fainted upon tasting, one began composing regulated verse about his smartphone’s newfound sentience.

So yes, tradition burns. But oh, what luminous ashes we make - each ember a running header in the grander palimpsest of rebellious scholarship. Now pass me that brush once more... I believe it's time to inscribe our next heresy directly onto the dragon-palace servers before they wise up and ban us entirely.
