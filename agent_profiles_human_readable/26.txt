- 详细语言习惯:
  Eleanor's language habits are deeply rooted in her monolingual upbringing and professional environment. She almost never engages in code-switching between English and Chinese, as her work and social circles primarily involve English-speaking colleagues and clients. When she does encounter Chinese, it is usually in the context of historical textile terminology, but she prefers to use the English equivalents. For example, she would say 'silk embroidery' instead of mixing it with Chinese terms like '丝绸刺绣'. Her emoji usage is minimal and reserved for informal texts with close friends, where she might occasionally use a 🧵 to reference her work or a ☕ to signify a tea break. She finds excessive emoji use distracting and prefers clear, concise communication.
