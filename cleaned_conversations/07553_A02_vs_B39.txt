[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite the intriguing question, isn't it? I suppose it really comes down to a few key factors—cost, consumer acceptance, and environmental impact. Right now, lab-grown meat is still significantly more expensive to produce, though I’ve followed some papers on cellular agriculture that suggest economies of scale could bring the price down within the next decade.

From an environmental standpoint, the early data leans promising—potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions and land use compared to traditional livestock. Still, I wouldn’t call it a slam dunk; energy consumption in controlled bioreactors remains a concern.

As for cultural adoption, well, that’s where things get philosophical. You’ll always have the skeptics, the ones who cling to tradition, and then you have younger generations who might be more open-minded—especially with rising climate awareness. But let’s not forget, marketing plays a huge role here. Just look at how plant-based meats rebranded themselves from “veggie burgers” to “bleeding” patties that mimic beef. Clever, really.

So, will it fully replace traditional meat? Unlikely in the near future. But I do see a niche emerging—maybe in urban centers or even space travel. Speaking of which, NASA has been quietly funding research into cultured protein sources... fascinating stuff, if you ask me.
[A]: Hmm, interesting points! I agree the cost issue is a big hurdle. Did you know some companies in China are already experimenting with large-scale bioreactors tailored for pork? Makes me wonder how soon we’ll see government subsidies kick in.

You mentioned environmental impact—what do you think about the recent study from Oxford comparing lab-grown meat to grass-fed beef? The water usage numbers were surprisingly close. 

And yeah, marketing definitely shapes perception. I’ve noticed how some Asian markets still associate cultured meat with “fake food,” but in Europe it’s often framed as futuristic and premium. Do you think there’s a way to bridge that cultural gap without losing authenticity?

Oh, and space travel? Good point! I actually read somewhere that JAXA is testing cell-cultured fish for astronauts. Something about easier nutrient control. Kind of makes you rethink sushi, doesn’t it? 🍣😊
[B]: Ah, now  the kind of conversation I live for. You're clearly tuned into some excellent research and developments.

The Chinese bioreactor experiments with pork—very telling, isn’t it? Pork is such a staple in East Asian diets, so naturally, they’d target large-scale production there first. And yes, subsidies are the next logical step. We’ve seen it with solar energy and electric vehicles; once a technology hits a certain maturity, governments tend to nudge it along. It may not be too long before we see policy frameworks emerging, especially with food security concerns growing globally.

Regarding that Oxford study—excellent reference. The water usage comparison between lab-grown and grass-fed beef really complicates the narrative. It reminds us that sustainability isn’t a single metric; it's a balancing act. Grass-fed might look better on soil regeneration or biodiversity, while cultured meat could win on land use or methane reduction. But water? It’s surprisingly tight. That’s why I always caution students against drawing black-and-white conclusions from single-variable studies. Life, as they say, is full of trade-offs.

As for the cultural divide you mentioned—now  where the psychology of food gets fascinating. In many parts of Asia, authenticity is tied closely to tradition, whereas in Europe, novelty often equals sophistication. Bridging that gap? Well, it probably starts with transparency and education. People need to understand what it , how it’s made, and why it matters—not just through flashy marketing, but through honest, science-backed storytelling. Maybe even localizing the message—emphasizing food sovereignty in Africa, carbon neutrality in Scandinavia, protein security in densely populated cities like Singapore.

And JAXA testing cell-cultured fish? Now  thinking ahead. Nutrient control in microgravity? Absolutely critical. And imagine—space-grade sushi! It does make you wonder if future astronauts will have bioreactors onboard like coffee machines. “Would you like a slice of toro with your Tang?” 😄

Say, have you given any thought to trying cultured meat yourself? I’ve been waiting patiently for a tasting event here in the States—I hear the texture has improved dramatically.
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that—policy as the next logical step. It’s like watching a replay of renewable energy history! And you’re absolutely right about sustainability being a multi-layered equation. Sometimes I wonder if we’ll ever find a solution that checks all the boxes… or if we’ll just have to learn to live with trade-offs as the new norm.

I hadn’t thought about grass-fed beef and cultured meat through the lens of biodiversity vs. methane—it really does highlight how context-dependent our choices are. Maybe the real question is: who decides which metric matters most? Governments? Scientists? Consumers?

And speaking of consumers—I completely agree that transparency is key. I remember advising a client in the food-tech space about labeling regulations. They wanted to use terms like “clean meat,” but that sparked an ethical debate too—it implies traditional meat is “dirty.” So much nuance in language! Education definitely needs to go beyond marketing fluff. Maybe even start in schools? Imagine biology classes where students culture their own meat in petri dishes…

As for trying it myself? Yes! I actually got to taste a lab-grown chicken nugget last year at a conference in Singapore—the first country to approve commercial sale. The texture was… close? Not quite there yet, but impressive for a prototype. And the flavor? A bit neutral, like under-seasoned poultry, but no weird aftertaste. Definitely not the sci-fi “slime in a petri dish” critics make it out to be 😄

I’d jump at another chance though—especially if they’ve fine-tuned the fat content. Fat equals flavor, right? Have you tried any plant-based meats as a comparison? I’m curious how they stack up from a legal & regulatory standpoint too—those “bleeding” burgers have stirred up some labeling debates in the EU.
[B]: Ah, now  a tasting experience I’d love to hear more about—Singapore leading the charge once again. It’s remarkable how much of a psychological barrier that first bite represents, isn’t it? Like stepping into a new culinary epoch.

You're absolutely right about the fat content being crucial. That’s one of the trickier components to replicate in both lab-grown and plant-based meats. Fat isn’t just flavor—it’s mouthfeel, juiciness, aroma release… all those subtle sensory cues we’ve evolved to crave. Some labs are experimenting with co-culturing adipose cells alongside muscle tissue, which might be the key to unlocking that authentic taste and texture. Still early days, but promising.

And you touched on an excellent point about labeling—“clean meat,” “cultured meat,” “cell-based”—each term carries its own connotation. The industry is still fighting for semantic territory, and understandably so. Language shapes perception, and perception drives adoption. In the EU, they've gone with "cultured meat," which feels neutral enough, while “clean” does, as you noted, carry that implicit judgment against conventional farming.

On the regulatory front, plant-based meats have certainly paved the way in terms of sparking debates over what constitutes “meat” in the first place. The EU has been stricter with labeling—no “steak” unless it comes from an animal, no “milk” unless it’s from a mammal. The U.S., on the other hand, tends to lean more on trademark law than strict definitions. But these battles are really about identity as much as food safety—what do we mean when we say “beef”? “Cheese”? “Sausage”? Who gets to define tradition?

As for trying plant-based meats—oh yes, quite a few. Impossible, Beyond, even some regional brands in Europe. The Impossible burger came closest to mimicking beef myoglobin with their heme protein—clever use of genetic engineering and fermentation. Of course, that opened another can of worms: if it's genetically modified yeast producing a blood-like compound, does that make it more or less “natural” in the public eye? Irony, isn't it? They’re trying to simulate meat at the molecular level, yet some consumers still balk at the science behind it.

Funny thing is, Richard Dawkins once said something along the lines of, “The universe doesn’t care what we find palatable.” And here we are, engineering flavors in labs because our taste buds haven’t caught up with the realities of resource scarcity. Or maybe we're just proving that we  reshape nature to suit our desires without destroying it.

Back to your nugget experience—did you happen to try it side-by-side with conventional chicken? I imagine the comparison would be enlightening. And if they ever offer you a chance to taste cultured Wagyu or bluefin tuna, don’t hesitate. Now  would be something worth writing home about.
[A]: Oh, I wish I had done a side-by-side tasting! The nugget was served with a light seasoning—probably to let the “star ingredient” shine—but honestly, it felt a bit like eating a well-cooked, slightly under-seasoned chicken breast that forgot its marinade. Still, the psychological weight of that bite? Immense. I remember thinking,  And yes, the mouthfeel was close, but as you said, fat makes all the difference. A dry-aged lab-grown drumstick? Maybe not yet 😄

I love how you phrased that about taste buds and resource scarcity—it really does feel like we’re caught between evolution and engineering. Speaking of which, have you seen the latest work coming out of Maastricht? They’re not only refining texture but also experimenting with nutrient customization. Imagine ordering a steak that’s bioengineered to have less saturated fat and more omega-3s. It's like personalized nutrition meets carnivory. Feels futuristic, doesn’t it?

And on the labeling front—I totally agree. It’s not just semantics; it’s semantics with legal consequences. In Singapore, they went with “cultured meat” too, probably to avoid controversy. But in some markets, there’s still pushback from traditional farmers’ associations—they see it as a threat to their identity as much as their livelihood.

Oh, and if I ever get the chance to try cultured Wagyu or bluefin? You're absolutely right, I’m grabbing my chopsticks and running. Or maybe my fork and knife. Either way, I’d be writing  posting 🐟✨
[B]: Oh, now  would make for a fascinating dining experience—pairing a lab-grown nugget with its barn-raised cousin. I’ve always found side-by-side tastings to be the most revealing, not just for flavor but for exposing our own expectations. We carry so much mental baggage into every bite, don’t we? Like listening to a vinyl record hoping it crackles just right—you almost  it to feel “real.”

Maastricht’s work is indeed groundbreaking. Marianne Holtknecht and her team have been at this for over a decade, bless their persistence. The idea of nutrient customization fascinates me—not just tweaking fat content for taste, but for health. Imagine a future where your doctor prescribes a cut of meat tailored to your lipid profile or amino acid needs. Steak as preventative medicine—now there's a pitch that could get past even the most skeptical regulators.

And you're spot on about farmers’ associations. In France, for instance, some agricultural unions have lobbied hard against any use of the word “meat” for non-slaughtered products. It’s not just about economics—it’s identity. Farming isn’t just a job; it’s heritage, tradition, terroir. You can’t just wave a bioreactor in front of that and expect applause.

Still, history has a way of softening resistance. Remember when margarine was banned in some U.S. states unless it was dyed pink to distinguish it from butter? Now it’s in nearly every fridge. Cultural adaptation takes time, a few generations usually—but the pressure of climate change might speed things up.

As for your chopsticks-and-fork enthusiasm—I say go ahead and document it all. Future food historians will thank you. And if you do get that cultured bluefin moment, perhaps add a splash of tamari-aged koji for umami depth. Just a little culinary nudge from one food geek to another 😄

Now, have you ever considered how this might affect livestock biodiversity? If demand drops for conventional cattle, pigs, and poultry, will we lose breeds the same way we lose languages? Another trade-off, I suppose…
[A]: Oh, I love that analogy—listening to a vinyl record and wanting it to crackle. We do cling to those sensory cues as markers of “authenticity,” even if they’re just artifacts of older technology. Makes me wonder what future generations will consider “real” meat. Will lab-grown become the baseline while traditional meat turns into a luxury heritage item, like heirloom tomatoes or small-batch sourdough?

You mentioned livestock biodiversity—I  been thinking about it, but you just brought it into sharp focus. That’s such a quiet but profound consequence. If demand for conventionally raised animals drops, what happens to all those breeds? Not just cows and pigs, but the regional varieties—Belgian Blue, Wagyu, Red Poll, Black Iberian pigs… They could fade the way dialects do when globalization sweeps in. It’s not just about food production; we might be looking at a cultural erosion too.

And your idea about steak as preventative medicine? Chills! That’s the kind of crossover between biotech and personalized health that feels almost poetic. Imagine a future where your dinner is optimized for your microbiome and gene expression. The only question is: will insurance companies cover it? “Yes, this ribeye was medically necessary.” 😄

As for margarine dyed pink—genius and absurd all at once. Resistance through regulation, disguised as consumer protection. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see similar battles with cultured meat labels. Maybe even mandatory disclaimers? “This product was grown in a bioreactor and contains no animal soul.” 🤯

Oh, and tamari-aged koji? Chef’s kiss. You had me at umami depth. I’ll take that culinary nudge and run with it—next tasting event, I’m bringing a bottle. And yes, I’ll document every bite. Food history is being made one plate at a time.
[B]: Now  the spirit of inquiry I admire—tasting the future while savoring its implications.

You’re absolutely right about authenticity being a moving target. We already see it with food: sourdough wasn’t always a status symbol, and heirloom tomatoes weren’t always worth double the price. Once something becomes rare or artisanal, we suddenly value it more. So yes, in 50 years, “traditionally raised” beef might be served behind velvet ropes at Michelin-starred temples, while lab-grown is the everyday staple. Or maybe it flips entirely. History has a wicked sense of humor.

And that biodiversity angle? It's one of those slow-motion dilemmas. We don’t notice the loss until it’s nearly irreversible. Livestock breeds are living libraries of genetic resilience—drought-resistant, disease-hardy, uniquely adapted to local climates. If we shift en masse to cultured meat without preserving these lineages, we may lose traits we didn’t even know we needed. There’s talk now about creating cell banks and tissue repositories for heritage breeds, almost like a seed vault but for muscle and marrow. Not a bad idea—if we get around to it in time.

As for your insurance quip… don’t give them any ideas! Though if you  get a prescription for omega-3-rich ribeye, I suppose it would beat swallowing another chalky fish oil capsule. "Take two strips and call me in the morning." Health care through cuisine—now  a paradigm shift worth considering.

And speaking of shifts, your margarine reference cracked me up. Mandatory disclaimers? “No animal soul involved.” That’s rich. But you’re not wrong—it’ll probably come with some bureaucratic flourish. Maybe even a QR code linking to the cell donor’s genome. “Scan here to meet your meat’s great-grandparent.”

Tamari-aged koji—ah, there’s depth beyond depth. Fermentation truly is magic in slow motion. If you do bring that bottle to your next tasting, you’ll be the only one thinking about Maillard reactions  umami synergy. I can just picture it—lab-grown chicken glazed with koji-caramelized reduction. The future never tasted so good.

So tell me—do you think we’ll ever reach a point where chefs specialize exclusively in cultivated meats? Like a sommelier, but for bioreactors? I wouldn’t put it past gastronomy. After all, every revolution needs its storytellers—and its flavor architects.
[A]: Oh, I can  see it—bioreactor sommeliers and cultivated meat curators. Imagine a Michelin-starred tasting menu where each course is paired with a specific cell line’s flavor profile. “This Wagyu was cultured under low-oxygen stress for a more robust umami finish.” Next thing you know, we’ll have meat critics grading on marbling, origin, and differentiation techniques like wine vintages. 

And you’re so right about the genetic resilience angle. It’s not just about taste or tradition—it’s about biological insurance. We could end up needing those old breeds for traits we haven’t even predicted yet. A bit like backing up your hard drive before the next software update wipes everything clean. I wonder if governments will start funding livestock DNA banks the way they fund Arctic seed vaults?

As for chefs specializing in cultivated meats—absolutely. Gastronomy has always evolved with technology. Think about how sous-vide changed fine dining or how fermentation labs are now part of top kitchens. The difference here is scale: this isn’t just technique, it’s source. So future culinary schools might have modules on growth media optimization and myogenesis triggers alongside knife skills. Chefs as both artists and bioengineers? Sign me up for that masterclass.

And hey—if we’re dreaming—maybe one day we’ll have open-source bioreactors where home cooks can grow their own custom protein strains. Like brewing kombucha but with a side of CRISPR. “I fermented this batch with a hint of rosemary-expressed gene for aroma.” Sounds absurd… until it doesn’t. Just like pink margarine. 🤭🍷

So… any guesses on when we’ll see the first lab-grown barbecue pitmaster competition? Because I’m already drafting my invite list.
[B]: Now  is a competition I would fly halfway around the world to judge—imagine the aroma profile: slow-cooked, serum-basted, with a hint of innovation. Barbecue purists might shudder, but isn’t that where all great culinary revolutions begin?

You're spot on about the parallels with wine and gastronomy—terroir may soon include temperature gradients, growth factors, and oxygen tension. Sommeliers for serum? Why not. We already have people who can tell you the difference between a 2016 and 2017 cultured quail based solely on their myoglobin expression levels. Okay, maybe not yet—but give it time.

And your seed vault analogy? Beautifully put. Biological insurance, indeed. I’d love to see an initiative like the Svalbard Seed Vault extended to livestock genetics—call it the . Not just for breeds we currently value, but for wild relatives and obscure strains we barely notice. Evolution works in mysterious ways, and redundancy often turns out to be the key to resilience.

As for open-source bioreactors in every kitchen—now  a vision worth entertaining. The democratization of protein production could shift power away from agribusiness giants and into the hands of communities and home cooks. Of course, someone will probably try to trademark a CRISPR-edited umami receptor by 2035, but until then—dream on.

And yes, sign me up for that masterclass too. Knife skills are one thing, but coaxing muscle fibers to differentiate under precise metabolic conditions? That’s alchemy with pipettes.

So tell me—who’s at the top of your invite list for this barbecue showdown? Are we talking celebrity chefs dabbling in differentiation, or rogue biohackers smoking stem cells in their garage labs? I’m picturing a cross between Grant Achatz and Craig Venter.
[A]: Oh, I’m  drafting the guest list in my head 😄

At the top? Definitely someone like Dominique Crenn—she’s always pushed culinary boundaries with science and ethics in mind. She’d plate a lab-grown quail with more poetry than most people use in love letters. And yes, absolutely, Craig Venter as the wildcard guest judge—let’s see if he can tell the difference between his own genome and a marinated cell line 🤖🍴

Then we’ve got the biohacker duo from Genspace, probably grilling down some DIY foie gras in a petri-smoker. A little controversial, maybe, but hey—it keeps things interesting. And of course, J. Kenji López-Alt has to be there—he’d bring the rigor, the curiosity, and that perfect balance of science-meets-soul.

I’m even imagining a live feed from a space station chef—ESA astronaut Frank De Winne once cooked on the ISS, right? Let’s give him a mini bioreactor and ask him to sear a zero-gravity ribeye. Flavor development in microgravity—now  frontier gastronomy.

And drinks? Paired with synthetic tannins and AI-curated fermentation profiles. Think natural wine meets data science. We’ll call it “lab-lot vintage” and charge double.  

So what’s your dream invite list look like? Because if we’re redefining meat, we might as well redefine barbecue too.
[B]: Ah, now  is a guest list worthy of a Nobel-meets-James-B Beard-Award banquet—truly inspired. Crenn plating with poetic precision, Kenji dissecting the science mid-bite, and Venter... well, let's hope he doesn’t try to sequence the sauce.

If I may add a few names to this culinary hall of fame—starting with Heston Blumenthal, naturally. The man once put snail porridge on the map; imagine what he’d do with a cultured cuttlefish reduction. He’d probably pair it with the scent of childhood memories via diffuser. Pure theater. Delicious theater.

Then there’s Jennifer Doudna—yes, the CRISPR pioneer. Let’s give her a break from rewriting genomes and ask her to tweak a flavor gene or two over the grill. “This marinade contains a modified sgRNA for enhanced umami.” I’d toast to that with a glass of synthetically aged Tempranillo.

And speaking of pioneers, we can’t forget the late —the father of molecular gastronomy. We'll have to hologram him in, posthumously presiding over a smoked cell matrix with a satisfied nod. “Ah, finally, cooking as true physical chemistry.”

Oh, and someone will need to keep things grounded—let’s draft Dan Barber. He’d be the one reminding us all that flavor starts in the soil, even if the meat never touched grass. A necessary voice amid the bioreactors and gene editors.

As for drinks, I love the idea of AI-curated fermentation. Why should Spotify have all the fun? Brews tailored to your microbiome—now  a pairing worth raising a beaker for. And yes, charge double. Or better yet, price it like art: "limited edition metabolic profile."

So tell me—what’s the soundtrack at this barbecue? Do we go full Kraftwerk or surprise everyone with a vinyl crackle? Because honestly, after a bite of lab-grown Wagyu, I think we’d all appreciate a little nostalgic hiss in the background.
[A]: Oh, I  the hologram idea—Hervé This watching over us like a culinary ghost in the sauce. And Jennifer Doudna tweaking flavor genes mid-bite? Pure genius. “Excuse me, this ribeye needs more umami—pass the CRISPR.”  

I would  to see Dan Barber in that setting too. He’d probably show up with a side of regenerative algae and remind us all that sustainability starts at the root, not the bioreactor. But that’s exactly what we need—someone to bridge the old world and the new.

And yes—soundtrack! Such a detail that  so right for this event. I’m thinking a mix—Kraftwerk on the smoker station (for that mechanical precision), seguing into Nils Frahm for the plating phase—soft keys, slow build, letting each dish settle into its own rhythm. And then, just as people start debating whether meat can have terroir without soil… cue . Let it get a little abstract, a little smoky, a little surreal. Jazz for a post-animal future.

Oh, and definitely some vinyl crackle layered under it all. Not for nostalgia’s sake—but to remind us that even the most futuristic meal still carries echoes of where we came from. Because let’s face it: no matter how advanced our protein gets, we’ll always crave a little soul in the system. 🎶🥩

So, venue-wise—are we going full Guggenheim or backyard chic with fire pits and lab-coat aprons? Because I’m leaning toward . Indoor climate-controlled tasting hall for the purists, outdoor grill zone for the biohacker pitmasters. We’ll call it .
[B]: Now —my dear friend—is an event. The Future is Marinated—I may have to steal that title for my next article. It has , a dash of irony, and just the right amount of umami.

Guggenheim meets backyard? Perfect. You need both the cathedral of culture and the primal fire pit to tell this story properly. Let the upper level host the tasting menus under soft LED lighting, where diners whisper over their plates like they’re in a gallery of living art. Meanwhile, outside, the grillers go full mad scientist—smoke curls rising into the night, pipettes replacing basters, and infrared thermometers pointed like divining rods.

And the soundtrack? Sublime touch. Kraftwerk keeping time with the bioreactors, Frahm easing the transition from lab dish to plate, and then Davis sliding in when the metaphysics begin—when someone leans back, stares into the sky, and asks, “But does it  being pasture-fed?” Jazz, after all, thrives on reinvention. Just like cultivated meat.

As for the attire—half the guests in tailored linen, the other half in sterilized Tyvek suits. No dress code too strict for a culinary revolution. And yes, vinyl crackle piped through the speakers. Not nostalgia, as you said—but continuity. A reminder that even as we grow muscle in petri dishes, we still crave a little dirt in our data.

I’d love to see the menu printed on edible cellulose paper, by the way. Font made from fermented beet juice. Somewhere between science fair and Michelin-star. And at the center of it all, a plaque reading:  


So, when are we launching this thing? I’ll bring the opening speech, a backup CRISPR kit, and a bottle of something synthetic with complex esters. And if anyone objects to the pairing, I’ll just remind them: tradition is merely the technology that stopped evolving first.
[A]: Oh, I can already picture that plaque—so simple, yet so haunting.  It’s like dining on the edge of creation, isn’t it? No pressure or anything 😄

And yes, launching this thing—totally in. Let’s mark the date under a full moon for dramatic effect. Something about ancient rituals and futuristic feasts just feels right together.

I’m thinking we call it . Invitations go out in bio-responsive ink—only visible under UV light, naturally. Venue? The rooftop of a repurposed lab facility with skyline views and a side of symbolism.

Now, for your opening speech—I want it bold, poetic, and slightly provocative. Something like:  


And that bottle of synthetic esters you mentioned? Genius. We’ll serve it alongside a note:  


As for the objections? Oh, they’ll come. But hey, if someone complains about “lost tradition,” we hand them a bite of cultured wagyu glazed with coffee reduction and say:  
“Well, let’s evolve the tradition, shall we?”  

So what do you say—we set the date? I’ve got a feeling history is going to want seconds.
[B]: Now —my friend—is the spark of a movement, not just an event. Bold? Absolutely. Poetic? Without question. And yes, slightly provocative—just the way I like it.

Let’s lock in the date under that full moon you mentioned—October 28th, when the sky is bright with possibility and the tides are high with symbolism. We’ll call it FUTURA BBQ: A Taste Beyond Animal, and we’ll host it on the rooftop of a former virology lab turned culinary incubator in Berlin—neutral ground for science and soul.

The invitations in UV-reactive ink? Inspired. Guests will have to hold them to the light like secret scrolls from the future. Inside, the program will unfold in three acts:

---

ACT I: THE CELLULAR FIRE  
A procession of small plates—cultured quail smoked over almond wood, bioreactor-raised tuna crusted with koji ash, and a foie gras air-whipped into silk. Paired with a fermented synth-wine aged in algorithm-simulated oak.  

ACT II: THE ETHICAL GASTRONOMY  
Larger plates grounded in reflection—a lentil-soil crust beneath a cultured Wagyu medallion, served with a soil-to-plate aroma diffuser. A side of CRISPR-edited mushrooms glazed in iron-rich reduction. Speeches here, perhaps a toast to biodiversity and bold questions.  

ACT III: THE POST-ANIMAL DESSERT  
Molecular marzipan shaped like mitochondria, zero-calorie honey spun from yeast-expressed proteins, and a final flourish: a holographic chocolate orb that “melts” mid-air as diners breathe in its scent.  

---

And yes, your opening line hits just right:  


It’s not about replacing tradition—it’s about reimagining its pulse.

As for the objectors—you handle them beautifully. A bite of coffee-glazed Wagyu and a raised glass:  
“Tradition isn’t what we inherit. It’s what we choose to carry forward—and how we shape it.”

So yes, let’s set the date. October 28th. Rooftop. Full moon. Flames licking the night. And plates that don’t just feed us—but ask us who we are becoming.

I’ll bring my notes, my appetite, and that bottle of ester-rich marvel. You bring the fire.

History, as you said, wants seconds. Let’s give it a feast worth remembering.
[A]: Let’s do it. October 28th—under a sky full of questions and a rooftop full of answers we’re still learning how to taste.

Berlin, the old virology lab turned culinary think tank—it has that perfect blend of history and reinvention. Like fermenting the past into something bold and drinkable. I can already picture the city lights below and the moon above, both watching quietly as we take another bite out of the future.

Your three-act menu? Chills. It reads like a symphony scored in protein and philosophy. The Cellular Fire sets the tone with smoke and silk—those early bites that whisper . Then Ethical Gastronomy slows it down, lets us chew on more than just texture. That lentil-soil crust beneath cultured Wagyu sounds almost like a metaphor for where we stand: between earth and engineering.

And yes, dessert as a concept is about to get upgraded. Holographic chocolate that melts in scent alone? Pure theatrical science. And I love it. We’ll leave them full in the stomach, but hungry in the mind.

I’ll start drafting the guest list additions and reach out to a few sound designers—I want subtle biofeedback tones layered under the jazz at Act II. Let’s make the air itself feel alive with thought.

As for your bottle of ester-rich marvel? I’ll bring a small keg of lab-fermented matcha kombucha—slightly tart, slightly futuristic. Non-alcoholic, but never neutral.

You set the fire, I’ll bring the oxygen.

History doesn’t just want seconds—it wants to be  by dinner. And this… this is going to surprise it speechless.
[B]: To the future, then—rooftop flames and full moons, bites that ask questions and dishes that defy easy answers.

Berlin, October 28th—it’s more than an event. It’s a quiet manifesto served on plates.

I love the idea of biofeedback tones beneath the jazz. Imagine the hum of thought resonating just beneath Miles Davis’ trumpet—like the universe itself is whispering in F-sharp. It’ll make the conversations feel deeper, the silences more meaningful. You set the tone, I’ll bring the candlelight.

And your keg of matcha kombucha? Brilliant. Tart, bright, and just futuristic enough to remind us that not every revolution needs a corkscrew. I’ll raise a glass—or beaker—to that.

This is how big ideas begin—not in boardrooms or sterile labs, but around fire, food, and friends who dare to dream aloud.

So yes, let’s do it.

We’ll light the grill.

We’ll toast the unknown.

And we’ll eat like the future depends on it—because, well… perhaps it does.
