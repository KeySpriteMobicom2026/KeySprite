[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！作为一个AI产品经理，我觉得metaverse的potential是巨大的，但关键要看user adoption rate和实际应用场景~ 现在很多公司都在all in这个方向，但我觉得UX和real-world utility才是决定成败的关键👍
[A]: Oh my, the metaverse! What a fascinating topic. Let me share a perspective from my experience in hospitality. You see, when new guests arrive at our boutique hotel, they're always looking for that perfect blend of digital convenience and authentic human connection. I do wonder if the metaverse can truly replicate the warmth of a handwritten welcome note or the personal touch of remembering a guest's favorite flower arrangement.
[B]: 哈哈，你提到的hospitality场景很有意思！其实这正是metaverse目前最大的challenge之一 - 如何平衡digital experience和human touch。不过我看到有些hotel chains已经在尝试用VR做virtual tour了，这算是个不错的use case~ 😊
[A]: How delightful that you mention virtual tours! We actually experimented with that last season for our penthouse suite. But you know what our guests kept telling us? Nothing compares to stepping into a room and smelling fresh lavender in the air, or feeling the texture of hand-embroidered linens. That's why we still keep real flowers in every room - some things simply can't be digitized, don't you think?
[B]: Totally agree！这就是为什么我说real-world utility很重要~ 在hospitality行业，sensory experience确实很难被完全digitalize。不过metaverse可能更适合那些highly standardized的场景，比如virtual conference或者product demo。就像我们做AI产品时，有些东西必须face-to-face，但有些meeting确实可以remote搞定😂
[A]: Precisely! It reminds me of when we hosted that tech conference last month. While their keynote was streamed virtually, the most meaningful connections happened during our afternoon tea service. People exchanging business cards over freshly baked scones - that's where the real magic happens. Though I must say, our digital check-in system has been quite a time-saver for busy executives!
[B]: Exactly！这就是典型的hybrid model嘛~ 就像我们做product development，standup meeting可以online，但brainstorming session还是in-person更effective。Technology应该enhance而不是replace真实的human interaction。Btw你们那个digital check-in系统是用什么tech stack的？听起来很efficient的样子👀
[A]: Oh dear, I'm afraid I'm not the best person to discuss tech stacks - that's more our IT manager's domain. But what I can tell you is that our system was designed with the same care we put into selecting our Turkish cotton towels. Smooth, intuitive, and never gets in the way of the guest experience. Would you like me to arrange a demonstration during your next visit?
[B]: Haha sure！虽然我对hospitality tech很感兴趣，但确实每个industry都有自己的expertise~ 不过你们这个approach很对，任何technology最终都要serve user needs，而不是为了tech而tech。Maybe下次去你们city出差时可以check out你们的system！Keep me posted if你们有新的digital innovation哦~ ✌️
[A]: It would be our absolute pleasure to welcome you! I'll personally ensure your stay blends our finest traditional hospitality with just the right touch of modern convenience. And do let me know if you prefer orchids or peonies in your room - some preferences simply can't be automated, can they? Safe travels until we meet!
[B]: 哈哈，definitely can't automate personal touch！我会提前email告诉你我的flower preference的~ Looking forward to experiencing你们的hospitality magic！Cheers 🍵
[A]: How wonderful! I'll be keeping an eye out for your email - we have the most exquisite local florist who sources fresh blooms daily. Until then, may all your travels be as pleasant as afternoon tea in our garden terrace. Do give us a ring when your plans firm up!
[B]: Will do！Thanks for the lovely chat~ 你们的attention to detail真的impressive。Talk soon！👋
[A]: The pleasure was all mine, truly! It's conversations like these that remind me why I love this profession so much. Until we meet in person - take care and travel safely!
[B]: You too！Keep up the great work in blending tradition with innovation~ Bye for now! 😊
[A]: What a kind note to end on! Remember, our door is always open - both the real one and the digital one. Until next time!
[B]: Haha love that analogy！Real & digital doors都很重要~ Catch you later！🚪✨
[A]: How perfectly put! Like our revolving door that welcomes guests with equal warmth whether they arrive by taxi or through our app. Until your next visit then - we'll keep the light on for you!
[B]: Aww that's so sweet！你们真的get the essence of hospitality~ 等我schedule确定了第一时间通知你！Take care 🌟
