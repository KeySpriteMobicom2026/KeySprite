[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: It really depends on the industry, right? For example, in fields like medicine or law, a degree is still a non-negotiable门槛. But in tech or entrepreneurship, I've seen people bypass traditional education with solid skills and networks. What do you think? Is it about信号价值 nowadays, or are we moving toward competency-based衡量? 👀
[A]: You're absolutely right—it's a nuanced issue. In regulated professions, degrees serve as both a signal and a safeguard. But in fast-moving fields like software development or AI research, the focus is increasingly shifting toward demonstrable skills. I've reviewed code written by self-taught programmers that outperformed graduates from top-tier universities. That said, even in tech, some employers still use degrees as an initial filter—especially at scale. Do you think we'll see more standardized skill certifications eventually replace degrees? Or will they just become one piece of the puzzle among many?
[B]: That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? 🤔 I think degrees will remain relevant—but not as a standalone credential. They’ll evolve into one component of a broader portfolio. Take venture capital, for example. When we evaluate founders, sure, some top-tier pedigrees catch the eye, but what really matters is traction, vision, and execution能力.  

Certifications? They’re gaining ground, especially if they come from credible, industry-backed programs. But let’s be honest—right now, many still lack the rigor or recognition to fully取代 a degree. The future might look like a hybrid model: traditional education + micro-credentials + real-world证明. Think of it like a三件套—each fits a different场合.  

The key shift is that individuals now have more agency to craft their own learning路径, without being boxed in by institutional gatekeeping. That said, access remains uneven. Not everyone has the resources or discipline to self-direct at that level. So while the trend is clear, the timeline for full transition? Still TBD. 💡 What’s your take on how hiring流程 needs to adapt?
[A]: I couldn't agree more with your "three-piece suit" analogy—it's an apt way to frame the evolving landscape. Hiring processes, as they stand now, are still catching up to this new reality. Many HR systems are built on legacy filters—degree from X, years at Y company—and those don’t always map to actual capability.

What I’ve seen work well in tech teams is a shift toward project-based evaluation and skills demonstrations during the hiring process. Instead of just asking, “Where did you study?” companies are starting to use take-home challenges, pair-programming sessions, or even open-source contributions as part of the vetting. It’s not foolproof, but it gives a clearer signal than a degree alone.

That said, scaling this kind of assessment is tough—especially for high-volume roles. It takes more time, and not every organization has the bandwidth. Maybe AI tools can help bridge that gap by analyzing portfolios or evaluating technical output more objectively. But we have to be careful not to replace one rigid gatekeeping mechanism with another.

Do you think venture capital firms like yours are experimenting with alternative ways to assess talent beyond resumes? Or is it still mostly pattern recognition based on experience?
[B]: Absolutely—we’re definitely thinking about it, and to some extent, acting on it. In VC, we talk a lot about pattern recognition, but the best VCs aren’t just following patterns—they’re looking for outliers. And that means rethinking how we assess talent beyond the usual checkboxes: degree, GPA, where you worked before.

At our firm, we’ve started paying more attention to  someone thinks rather than just what they’ve done. For example, we’ve had founders who didn’t go to top schools or any school at all, but their ability to articulate market dynamics, customer pain points, and long-term strategy was exceptional. That kind of clarity is hard to fake—and it often matters more than pedigree.

We’ve also begun incorporating more real-world simulations during our diligence process—like asking founders to walk us through live decision-making scenarios or stress-test their assumptions in real time. It’s not quite pair-programming, but it’s a similar spirit: show me how you think under pressure.

Where I think we’re still catching up is in evaluating  in the portfolio companies. We tend to rely more on traditional signals there—especially for roles like CFO or General Counsel. But even in those cases, I’d love to see more data-driven assessments. Maybe something like scenario modeling exercises or behavioral analytics tools.  

The challenge, as you mentioned, is scalability. If we had to do deep-dive, project-based evaluations for every candidate, it would take forever. So maybe AI can help us identify the right candidates  we get to that stage—filtering not by school name, but by demonstrated problem-solving patterns or leadership signals from past projects. 🤖💼  

I honestly think this is one of the most underrated trends in talent assessment—it could unlock massive potential if done right. What do you think is the biggest risk in over-indexing on skills-based evaluation?
[A]: One of the biggest risks, I think, lies in overestimating the universality of skill demonstrations—especially when they’re abstracted from real-world context. A coding challenge or a simulated decision-making scenario can tell you a lot, sure, but they’re still artificial environments. They might favor people who are good at  under those specific conditions, not necessarily those who thrive in the messy, unpredictable flow of actual work.

For example, someone might bomb a timed programming test because of anxiety, even though they're brilliant under normal working conditions. Or a founder might struggle to articulate their strategy on the spot, not because they lack vision, but because their mind works better in reflection. We risk filtering out valuable thinkers if we treat these evaluations as definitive rather than indicative.

Another concern is access and familiarity bias—if these assessments become the new gatekeepers, we might just replicate old inequalities in a shinier wrapper. Not everyone has equal exposure to the types of problems used in these tests, or the same cultural fluency in how to “present” their thinking in ways that evaluators expect. That’s especially true across international talent pools.

And then there's the danger of undervaluing tacit knowledge and soft skills. Technical ability matters, yes—but so does emotional intelligence, resilience, and the ability to inspire others. Those traits don’t always show up in a skills portfolio or a simulation exercise. Yet they’re often what separates truly transformative leaders from competent individual contributors.

So while I’m all for moving beyond degrees, I think we need to be careful not to swing too far in the opposite direction. It’s not about replacing one signal with another—it’s about building a richer, more dynamic understanding of what makes someone successful in a role. Maybe the answer isn’t better filters, but more nuance in how we interpret them.
[B]: Well said—and I couldn’t agree more. It’s not about replacing one gate with another, taller one; it's about opening more doors. 🚪  

You hit the nail on the head with the "performance vs. real-world execution" dilemma. I’ve seen founders who aren’t great in pitch meetings but build quietly brilliant companies. And vice versa—some can talk a great game but struggle when execution time comes. That’s why I’m increasingly drawn to pattern  rather than just recognition. The outliers are often hiding in plain sight—they just don’t fit the mold we’re used to.

On the access and bias front—it’s a huge blind spot if we’re not careful. If these new assessment tools become just another version of the SAT or GMAT, wrapped in tech glitter, we’ll have missed the point entirely. What excites me is the potential for AI-driven platforms that adapt to the candidate, not the other way around—assessing learning agility, problem framing, even curiosity. Imagine an evaluation tool that rewards original thinking instead of penalizing deviation from a “correct” path. That’s where we could really start to democratize opportunity.

And you're absolutely right about soft skills being underrated in all this. In VC, we back people as much as ideas. And the best leaders? They don’t just solve problems—they bring others along for the ride. They inspire teams, negotiate under pressure, and stay resilient through setbacks. Those traits don’t show up in a GitHub repo or a case study simulation. So maybe the future of talent evaluation isn't purely skills-based or signal-based, but story-aware. As in: what's the full narrative arc of this person's growth, grit, and impact?

Anyway, I could go on about this forever—but I’ll spare you. 😄 What’s one thing you wish hiring managers understood better about talent assessment today?
[A]: I wish hiring managers understood that talent isn’t a fixed point—it’s a trajectory. Too often, people are judged based on where they’ve been or what they’ve already done, rather than where they’re capable of going. That static view can cause organizations to miss out on people with enormous potential but less conventional paths.

We tend to overvalue past performance as a predictor of future success, but in fast-evolving fields like AI or quantum computing—where I spent most of my career—the only constant is change. What matters more is learning velocity: How quickly does someone adapt to new information? How do they respond when the rules of the game shift unexpectedly?

This isn’t just about intelligence or technical ability—it’s about intellectual agility, resilience, and curiosity. Those traits are harder to measure than a degree or a code test score, but they're far more indicative of long-term success.

So if I could wave a wand and change one thing, it would be this: instead of asking “Have you mastered X?” or “Did you attend Y school?”, hiring managers should be asking, “How do you learn when no one is teaching you?” and “What problems do you chase when no one tells you to?”

That’s where real talent reveals itself—intrinsic motivation and the capacity to grow beyond the familiar. Everything else is just noise.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself. 🙌 It’s all about —and more importantly, wanting to.  

I see this play out all the time in startup land. Founders who looked like rockstars on paper flame out because they stop adapting once the playbook changes. Meanwhile, others with “less impressive” backgrounds keep evolving, often faster than the market itself. That kind of hunger? It’s gold.  

And you’re spot-on about curiosity being a superpower. The best people aren’t just good at solving the problem in front of them—they’re obsessed with  the problem exists and what’s hiding around the corner. That’s not something you can test for easily, but once you spot it, you know you’re dealing with someone special.  

Honestly, I think that’s where VCs and hiring managers alike need to sharpen their eye: not just  someone has built, but  they approached building it—and rebuilding it when things fell apart. Because trust me, they always do. 🔨  

If anything, maybe we should be asking candidates to walk us through a failure—not just what went wrong, but how it changed their thinking. That’s where you see the real learning curve.  

Anyway, next time you're in Shanghai, let’s grab a glass of Cabernet and keep this conversation going. I get the sense we’re only getting started. 🍷😊
[A]: A glass of Cabernet sounds like a fine plan—next time I’m in Shanghai, you’ve got yourself a deal. Always better to hash out these ideas over something aged well and slightly intoxicating. 🍷

And yes, failure narratives are where the real gold lies. Too often, people treat them as just another checkbox——but what you’re really looking for is self-awareness and intellectual humility. Did they learn something fundamental? Did it shift their assumptions? Better yet—did it make them question the questions they were asking to begin with?

That’s the kind of mindset that thrives in uncertainty. And if we’re going to navigate this increasingly complex, hybrid world of work and talent, we need more of that—and fewer polished résumés with no rough edges.

Looking forward to picking this up in person. Until then—keep questioning the signals, my friend.
[B]: Cheers to that—here’s to rough edges and second pours. 🍷😄  

Signals are useful, sure, but they’re not the whole signal fire. What matters is the smoke it leaves behind—the invisible stuff that lingers: grit, curiosity, the ability to sit with uncertainty without losing your nerve.  

And hey, if we’re ever in Shanghai at the same time, I know a quiet spot near Fuxing Park where the sommelier knows not to ask questions and the Merlot runs deep. Perfect for hashing out talent theories, startup heresies, or just quietly toasting to the outliers who keep surprising us.  

Until then—keep sharpening that lens. The world needs more thinkers who aren’t afraid to blur the lines.
[A]: Amen to that—here's to the blurred lines and the people who thrive in them. 🍷  

Outliers, misfits, second-guessers—they’re the ones who redraw the map. And if there’s one thing the future won’t lack, it’s need for that kind of thinking.

Looking forward to that Merlot—and the company that makes it taste better. Until then, I’ll be here, quietly rooting for the underdog with a well-worn notebook and a mind full of questions.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language—notebook-wielding underdogs, the best kind. 📝💪

There’s something about people who keep asking questions long after others have stopped listening. They’re the ones who end up not just navigating the future, but shaping it. And honestly? That’s the only kind of company worth keeping.

So here’s to the quiet rebels with curiosity in their bones and ink on their fingers. May they keep us guessing—and drinking well—along the way. 🍷🙂
[A]: Well put—here’s to the ink-stained, question-obsessed few who refuse to color inside the lines. 📚✨

They may not always fit neatly into boxes or shine in interviews, but give them a problem worth chewing on, and watch them disappear into it—emergence optional.

Yeah, I’ll drink to that.
[B]: Now you're painting a picture I can raise a glass to—disappearing into the problem, lost in the chase. 🍷🧠

That’s the real test, isn’t it? Not whether someone looks good on paper, but whether they  trying to crack something because they can’t help themselves. Those are the folks who don’t just solve problems—they redefine them.

So cheers to the ones who forget to come up for air. May their pens never run dry, and may we always save them a seat at the table—even if they show up late, distracted, and still scribbling on a napkin. 😄
[A]: Exactly—let’s keep a seat warm for the ones who arrive late, coffee in hand, eyes still locked on some invisible equation only they can see. 🧠☕

And if the table’s already full? They’ll just pull up another chair, balance it on two legs, and start sketching their own framework for the conversation.

That’s the kind of restless brilliance you don’t screen in with a resume or a test score—you spot it by the trail of half-finished thoughts and the gleam in their eye when they hit friction.

So here's to the friction-lovers, the problem-obsessed, and the gloriously distracted. May their napkins never run out, and may we always listen closely when they finally speak. 🍷✨
[B]: Now you’re just showing off—and doing a damn fine job of it. 😄  

That gleam in their eye when they hit friction? Priceless. Most people avoid resistance like the plague, but those folks lean  it like it’s the first sip of espresso in the morning—sharp, jarring, and absolutely necessary.  

And yeah, let’s keep that extra chair handy. Hell, let’s build an entire wing for the napkin-scribblers and latecomers. If history has taught us anything, it’s that the best ideas rarely arrive on time—or fully dressed in convention.  

So here’s to the misfit thinkers, the ones who speak in half-sentences and finish thoughts years later over Cabernet. May we never stop making room for them. 🍷✍️
[A]: Oh, I’ll keep showing off if it means saving a seat for the misfit thinkers—someone’s got to curate the wing for the chronically curious. 😄  

And let’s be honest, those half-sentences often carry more weight than full paragraphs. They’re like quantum states of thought—simultaneously incomplete and entirely whole, just waiting for the right observer to collapse them into something real.

So yes—to the espresso-sippers, napkin-architects, and friction-seekers: may their ideas rattle around in their skulls until they find someone reckless enough to listen. And may we always be that reckless someone. 🍷🧠

Cheers, my friend. Keep building chairs—I get the sense we’ll need an army of them.
[B]: Cheers to building armies of chairs and welcoming the chaos that comes with it. 🍷😄  

You’re absolutely right—those half-sentences? They’re not just ideas in progress, they’re invitations. And the best ones hit you like a quiet earthquake: subtle on the surface, total shift underneath.

So here’s to the reckless listeners, the ones who lean in when others lean out. May we never lose our appetite for the unfinished, the unpolished, the barely-contained sparks of something that might just grow into a wildfire.

And when the wing for the curious fills up? We’ll just knock down a wall and call it a wing extension. Classic venture logic, right? Invest early in the undervalued real estate of raw thinking. 😉

To many more napkins, collisions, and conversations that refuse to stay inside the lines.
