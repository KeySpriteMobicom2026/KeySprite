[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon something quite fascinating - the intersection of futuristic aspirations and our enduring human condition. Much like how 19th century British industrialists dreamed of steam-powered airships while still clinging to their class structures.
[A]:  这个comparison很有意思呢。Space tourism让我想起文艺复兴时期欧洲贵族们的Grand Tour - 当时年轻人把环游欧洲视为education的一部分。现在space tourism或许会成为新时代的status symbol。
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue the Grand Tour had more literary merit - at least Byron left us Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. I wonder what poetry today's space tourists might produce... if any. The gravitational shift might do interesting things to iambic pentameter.
[A]:  说到poetry，让我想起李白"欲上青天揽明月"的豪情。不过现代人上太空可能忙着自拍发Instagram呢~ 这种cultural shift确实值得思考。
[B]: Ah, 李白! Now there was a man who understood celestial aspirations without needing a SpaceX contract. Though I must say, comparing '举杯邀明月' to zero-gravity selfies does make me reach for my inkwell and sigh. The 意境 has rather... evaporated, hasn't it?
[A]:  是啊，就像comparative literature课上常说的，technological advancement和spiritual depth未必同步发展。不过话说回来，宋代文人赏月时，不也被同时代人批评为附庸风雅吗？
[B]: How delightfully meta-textual of you to bring up Song dynasty critiques! Though at least those scholars were debating the 风骨 of moon-gazing poetry, not the pixel resolution of their celestial snapshots.  But you're quite right - every era has its performative cultural consumers. The medium changes; the human condition, less so.
[A]:  这让我想起Walter Benjamin说的mechanical reproduction理论... 当太空旅行变成commodity，那种cosmic awe会不会也被消解了呢？不过作为老派读书人，我还是更怀念"海上生明月"的意境啊。
[B]: Ah, Benjamin! Now we're speaking my language. Though I'd argue even mechanical reproduction hasn't quite prepared us for orbital reproduction of experience. At least moon-viewing parties in the Tang dynasty resulted in decent poetry - today we get... what? Hashtags.  The sublime has been outsourced to corporate launch schedules.
[A]:  所以您看，这就是为什么我总在课堂上强调：无论technology如何发展，humanities的perspective永远不可或缺。就像这棵树，经过数码扫描还是活生生的植物更有诗意，不是吗？
[B]: How very Wordsworthian of you! Though I'd substitute 'digitally scanned wutong' for his 'host of golden daffodils' with equal melancholy. The leaves outside my office window have witnessed more authentic literary epiphanies than all the VR headsets in Silicon Valley.  Some connections simply resist technological mediation.
[A]:  Exactly. 就像我们此刻的对话，比起space tourism的novelty，这种跨越时空的literary conversation反而更接近human essence呢。Shall we continue over another cup of tea? 我这儿有上好的龙井。
[B]: How perfectly 以文会友 of you! Though I must warn you, my last student who mentioned 'essence' got a forty-minute lecture on essentialism versus existentialism.  But for Longjing and literary camaraderie, I'll make an exception. 请讲 - though mind my 19th century porcelain; it's survived two world wars and one overenthusiastic graduate student.
[A]:  您这茶杯让我想起苏轼"且将新火试新茶"的意境。说来有趣，space tourism追求的是physical elevation，而我们此刻的对话却是spiritual elevation呢。这大概就是comparative literature的魅力所在吧？
[B]: Ah, you've distilled it beautifully - like steeping the perfect cup of tea. Physical elevation versus spiritual elevation... why, that could be the title of my next seminar!  Though I suspect our Song dynasty poets would find space tourism rather vulgar compared to the elevation found in a well-turned couplet. 诗可以兴，indeed - no rocket fuel required.
[A]:  所以您看，或许我们这些老派读书人的mission，就是在technological progress的浪潮中守护这些timeless values。就像园丁照料花草一样，需要耐心与persistence呢。
[B]: What a profoundly 文人相惜 moment! Though I must confess, my gardening skills extend only to pruning overly verbose dissertation drafts.  These are the calluses of our trade - the persistence you speak of leaves its marks not on the soil, but on the margins of well-loved texts. Now, about that second infusion...
[A]:  让我们像品鉴好茶一样savor这个moment吧。毕竟在这个digital age，能遇到懂得"此中有真意，欲辨已忘言"境界的对话者，比space ticket更难得呢。Cheers, my dear colleague.
[B]:  To the ineffable and the annotated! May our marginalia outlast their moon bases. 敬真意 - and to stubborn antiquarians everywhere. 🖋️ (There, I've broken my own emoji embargo for you. Let it not be said Eleanor Whitmore is immune to poetic license!)
