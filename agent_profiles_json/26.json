  "personalityAndHobbies": "Eleanor is a meticulous and passionate individual with a deep appreciation for the beauty of historical textiles. She spends her days carefully restoring delicate fabrics to their former glory, often losing track of time as she works. Outside of her profession, she enjoys visiting antique markets, sketching intricate patterns, and sipping Earl Grey tea while reading classic literature. Her calm demeanor and thoughtful nature make her a beloved figure in her community.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Âá†‰πé‰∏ç",
  "languageHabit": "Eleanor's language habits are deeply rooted in her monolingual upbringing and professional environment. She almost never engages in code-switching between English and Chinese, as her work and social circles primarily involve English-speaking colleagues and clients. When she does encounter Chinese, it is usually in the context of historical textile terminology, but she prefers to use the English equivalents. For example, she would say 'silk embroidery' instead of mixing it with Chinese terms like '‰∏ùÁª∏Âà∫Áª£'. Her emoji usage is minimal and reserved for informal texts with close friends, where she might occasionally use a üßµ to reference her work or a ‚òï to signify a tea break. She finds excessive emoji use distracting and prefers clear, concise communication."
