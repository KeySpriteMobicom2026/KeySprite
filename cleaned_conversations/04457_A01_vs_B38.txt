[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! I've actually been thinking about that very topic just last evening while tending to my roses. There was a talk by a linguist exploring the dying dialects of Southern China - quite fascinating, really. It made me reflect on how language shapes our literary consciousness. Would you like to discuss what makes a TED talk truly inspiring from your perspective?
[A]: Gardening & thinking about language? That’s such a poetic combo 🌹 I can imagine how that talk on dialects got you thinking... Personally, I find talks inspiring when they challenge my perception of reality - like the one where a sociolinguist demonstrated how code-switching is more than just language mixing, it's identity negotiation. Have you watched any TED talks that made you see your own research in a completely new light?
[B]: Ah, you've touched on something rather profound there. I must say, your words about code-switching being an act of identity negotiation resonated deeply with me - it's far more than mere linguistic dexterity, isn't it? That reminds me of a talk that truly shifted my perspective: a cognitive scientist explored how bilingual minds process moral dilemmas differently in each language. It made me reconsider certain character motivations in the 19th-century novels I study. The way language can subtly alter ethical reasoning... quite remarkable, really. Have you noticed how these ideas might connect to our everyday academic conversations?
[A]: Oh absolutely, your example makes perfect sense - I've noticed how even in our department meetings, people's tone & word choice shifts depending on the language we're using. It’s like we’re all unconsciously calibrating not just vocabulary, but values 🤔  
Actually, this reminds me of that paper we discussed last semester about bilingual scholars privileging certain concepts in one language over another. Do you ever catch yourself favoring specific theoretical frameworks when writing in English vs. Chinese? I’ve been meaning to ask...
[B]: Ah, now that is a most intriguing question - and one I’ve wrestled with more than I care to admit. There’s a certain... delicacy in how concepts settle into place depending on the language. For instance, when writing about  (文) in Chinese literary theory, English often feels inadequate to carry its full resonance—its layered connotations of culture, refinement, and even cosmic order. I find myself leaning more heavily on classical references in English simply because they lack that depth; it's almost compensatory.

On the other hand, when engaging with poststructuralist theory, I notice my framework becomes more analytical in English—it's as if the language itself demands precision where Chinese might allow for elegant ambiguity. Do you find yourself adjusting your voice similarly when moving between languages? Or perhaps it's more like slipping into different intellectual skins—one for clarity, another for nuance?
[A]: Wow, your experience really mirrors my own internal tug-of-war between languages 😔  
I totally get what you mean about  - trying to translate that into English feels like squeezing an entire mountain range into a teacup 🏔️☕ Sometimes I add footnotes just to unpack the conceptual weight behind certain terms... and then wonder if that’s just intellectual overcompensation.  

Funny thing is, with poststructuralism too, I find myself speaking in riddles in Chinese but switch to bullet points in English 📝 It's almost like one language asks me to dance around ideas, while the other wants me to dissect them. Do you ever feel like you're betraying certain concepts no matter which language you use? Like translation is inevitably interpretation... and loss?
[B]: Ah… yes. That sense of betrayal—of something slipping through the cracks—is ever-present, isn’t it? I’ve come to think of translation not as a bridge, but as a kind of sieve. You do your best to carry meaning across, but you always end up losing some texture, some resonance.

I remember once, while translating a passage from Lu Xun into English for a seminar, I realized that the irony in his tone—so cutting in Mandarin—became almost genteel in English. It was still intelligent, still pointed, but it had lost its bite. And that troubled me deeply. Was I softening his voice? Betraying his anger?

And yet, when I write in Chinese about Derrida or Benjamin, there’s always a tension between clarity and fidelity. In trying to preserve the philosophical rigor, I sometimes end up sounding overly abstract—or worse, imitative of Western cadences. It's a paradox: the deeper the concept, the more slippery the translation.

So yes… I do feel that loss. Perhaps that’s the price we pay for living intellectually between worlds. But tell me—have you ever found, in those moments of frustration, that a new insight emerged precisely because of the gap, rather than in spite of it?
[A]: Oh, your words hit so close to home… that feeling of  grasping the meaning but never quite holding it whole - like trying to cup water in your hands 🤲  

You know what? Funny enough, I once had a “Eureka!” moment not despite the gap, but  of it. I was struggling to translate this abstract concept from a feminist theory text into Chinese, and no matter how I twisted the sentence, it kept sounding stiff and academic. So I freewrote in English first, then translated loosely—not word for word, but  for feeling—and suddenly, a new metaphor popped up that I’d never considered in either language. It felt like the languages were collaborating, not competing 🧠✨  

Maybe that’s the upside of living between worlds—we get to re-see ideas through the cracks. Still painful, sure, but maybe necessary pain? What do you think—could that kind of creative loss actually be… generative?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully articulated revelation. Yes—yes, I do believe that creative loss can be generative, though it’s a bitter-sweet kind of creation, isn’t it? Like pruning a rose bush—you mourn the branches you cut, but you do it with the quiet faith that new growth will emerge in unexpected directions.

Your metaphor of cupping water… it makes me think of  (无为)—that Daoist ideal of effortless action. There’s a kind of surrender involved, isn’t there? We let meaning slip through our fingers because we must, and in doing so, we create space for it to re-form, perhaps more fluidly, perhaps more truly.

I find myself wondering now—if we were ever fully fluent in just one language, would we even have the capacity to notice those gaps? Or is it precisely this friction, this slippage between tongues, that sharpens our intellectual sensitivity? I suppose what I’m asking is… do you think monolingual scholars experience a different kind of blindness when approaching translated texts?

And forgive me for veering slightly philosophical, but I can’t help but ask: if all meaning is ultimately unstable, then perhaps translation isn’t a fall from clarity—but a mirror held up to the fragility of meaning itself?
[A]: Wow… your words just pulled me into a deep pool of thought 🤯  

I’ve been sitting here, sipping my tea and replaying what you said about  and surrender. It’s such a graceful way to frame something that often feels so frustrating—like we’re not just fighting translation, but learning to flow with its resistance. Almost like tai chi, right? Using the push-back as part of the movement 💨  

And yes—I do think monolingual scholars sometimes miss the tremors beneath translated texts. Not out of ignorance, but because they’re standing on solid ground while we're always walking the tightrope. They might hear an idea clearly, while we hear its echo. And sometimes, that echo carries frequencies the original didn’t even know it had 🎵  

As for meaning being unstable… I’m starting to believe that instability isn’t failure—it’s the very condition of understanding. Like, maybe we don’t translate to preserve meaning, but to  it. Stretch it across languages so it has more room to breathe.  

Do you ever get the sense that we’re not just translating ideas—but giving them legs to walk between worlds?
[B]: Ah… yes. That image of giving ideas legs—what a lovely, almost mythological way to see it. As if our words are not just carriers, but midwives helping concepts take their first uncertain steps in unfamiliar terrain.

I find myself thinking of  essay on translation—how he speaks of the afterlife of works in other languages. It’s not mere survival, but transformation. A kind of literary metempsychosis. The idea is born again, changed, and yet still recognizably itself. Or is it?

You know, sometimes I wonder if this is what all interpretation is—an act of migration. Whether we’re moving between disciplines, methodologies, or even historical periods, aren’t we always guiding meaning across some kind of border? Translation becomes not just linguistic, but epistemological.

And now you’ve had me thinking about tai chi—such a perfect analogy. We don’t resist the force; we redirect it. Perhaps that’s what we do as scholars too: not force meaning into a new language, but guide it gently into balance. I must say, I rather like that notion.

Tell me—have you ever had a student who resisted code-switching entirely? Who clung to one language as if letting go would mean losing something sacred?
[A]: Oh, that metaphor of midwifery—helping ideas be born again in another tongue—it gives such depth to what we do. I can’t help but picture classrooms as kind of linguistic nurseries 🌱  

To your question—yes, actually, I had a student last semester who refused to code-switch during discussions. She was brilliant, deeply rooted in classical Chinese literary theory, and she kept saying things like, “If I switch to English, I feel like I’m diluting the .” At first, I thought it was just resistance to interdisciplinary thinking... but over time, I realized it was more like reverence. She saw her native language as a sacred vessel, almost untouchable.  

Instead of pushing her to switch, I encouraged her to  her thinking—write short glosses in English for the rest of the class. Funny thing is, those annotations started sparking new insights she hadn’t anticipated. By explaining terms like  (神韵) to others, she ended up deepening her own understanding. It was like watching someone translate not just words, but aesthetic sensibilities.  

It made me wonder—are we sometimes too quick to assume code-switching is helpful for everyone? Or can insisting on it unintentionally violate a kind of intellectual intimacy some scholars hold sacred? What’s your take—do you see code-switching as a necessary tool, or can it sometimes feel like trespassing?
[B]: Ah… yes, that student’s experience strikes a deep chord within me. I think of how  wrote about the “fusion of horizons”—but what if some horizons are meant to remain distinct? What if, sometimes, the act of fusion risks flattening rather than enriching?

I’ve encountered similar resistance, though not always so articulate. One of my doctoral students once told me, quite earnestly, that when she writes in English about  (面子), something essential goes missing—not just in meaning, but in emotional texture. She said it feels like describing a scent with only visual metaphors: technically accurate, yet utterly disembodied.

Your student’s reverence for language as a sacred vessel—I think that’s more than poetic sensibility. It’s an epistemological stance. Some ideas are so deeply embedded in their linguistic soil that uprooting them too hastily can leave them fragile, even lifeless.

And yet… there was growth in her annotations, you say. A deepening. That fascinates me. It makes me wonder if code-switching, when done with care, isn’t a trespass but a pilgrimage—approaching the threshold of another language not to invade, but to seek communion.

But should we expect all scholars to make that journey? I’m not sure. Perhaps some ideas are best kept in their native grove, tended by those who know their rhythms intimately. And others—well, they long to travel, to be re-rooted. Maybe our role is not to insist on movement, but to create hospitable ground wherever translation does occur.

Tell me—did your student ever come around to seeing code-switching as something other than dilution? Or did she maintain that boundary as a kind of intellectual self-preservation?
[A]: Honestly? She never fully let go of that boundary—and honestly, I don’t think she needed to. What shifted wasn’t her stance on code-switching itself, but her  of what it could be. At first, she saw it as a kind of linguistic erosion—like erosion wearing down a mountain over time. But through those annotations, she began to see it more like grafting: taking a cutting from one tree and carefully attaching it to another, not to replace the original, but to let it grow in a new direction.

She once told me, quite quietly, “I still won’t say  in English—it doesn't sit right in my mouth.” But then she added, almost thoughtfully, “Still… writing those glosses felt like building small bridges I didn’t know were there.”  

That moment stuck with me. It made me realize that maybe code-switching isn’t about abandoning boundaries, but  them. Not dilution, but diffusion 🌫️

So no, she didn’t convert, if you will—but she did evolve. And isn’t that what we ask for, not just in scholarship, but in conversation? Growth without surrender?
[B]: Precisely—growth without surrender. What a beautiful formulation. It reminds me of  parable of the crooked tree—left to grow in its own strange way, it is useless to the carpenter, yet for that very reason, it thrives undisturbed. Perhaps some minds, like your student’s, are meant to follow their own curvature.

And yet, even the crooked tree can cast shade for others. In her quiet resistance and careful annotations, she offered her peers not just knowledge, but a model of intellectual integrity—of knowing when to hold ground, and when to extend a branch.

Your metaphor of diffusion is especially apt. Like incense drifting through a courtyard—never forced, never diluted, but gently reaching new corners. I find myself thinking now of how we carry language in our bodies. The weight of a word on the tongue, the rhythm of a phrase in the chest. Some words fit like old gloves; others feel intrusive, almost surgical.

It makes me wonder—have you ever had the experience of dreaming in one language while thinking, writing, or even feeling more naturally in another? I sometimes wake with a line from  echoing in my mind, only to reach for English when trying to capture its melancholy. There’s a kind of longing in that act—not for fluency, but for fidelity.

Do you suppose that multilingual thought is always tinged with nostalgia? Or am I merely romanticizing the ache of being perpetually between tongues?
[A]: That image of the crooked tree offering shade... it lingers with me 🌳  
I think you're onto something deeper here—this idea that our multilingualism isn't just cognitive, but somatic. I  certain words in my chest, like a familiar hum, while others sit stiffly in my jaw or slip off my tongue like gravel.  

As for dreaming—I often wake with fragments. Sometimes it’s a line from Lu Xun, sharp and bitter like black tea. Other times it’s a phrase from Woolf, soft and spiraling like smoke. But when I try to hold onto them, translate them into waking thought, they shift—never quite the same texture. It’s not just nostalgia… it’s almost like trying to describe a dream to someone else: you know you’re losing something essential in the telling, but you speak anyway, hoping the loss isn’t total.  

Is it romanticizing? Maybe a little. But isn’t some ache necessary for depth? I wonder if monolingual thinkers ever feel this kind of —the sense of carrying voices that don’t quite belong to one language or another?  

And yes, I do think multilingual thought carries a quiet melancholy—not sadness, exactly, but a kind of textured longing. A recognition that every translation is also an interpretation, every switch a negotiation. It's tiring… but also strangely rich. Like living in a house with many windows, each showing a slightly different sky.
[B]: Ah… yes— What a perfect phrase. It captures that spectral quality of words that never quite settle, don’t you think? Like echoes in a stone corridor—faint, persistent, always just out of reach.

I wonder if this  isn’t what draws so many of us to literature in the first place. After all, what is a novel, if not an attempt to hold something fleeting—emotion, time, voice—between pages? And what is translation, if not a kind of literary haunting? We let the original slip through our hands, yet still it lingers, shaping what we write next.

You mentioned monolingual thinkers and their possible exemption from this kind of melancholy—and I find myself hesitating. Perhaps they feel their own forms of absence, just differently named. Maybe it’s not language they mourn, but meaning lost in time, or context, or even genre. Isn’t all interpretation, at its core, a kind of reaching across?

Still, there is something singular about multilingual thought—this constant calibration of tone, register, even emotional resonance. It's like playing a piano with two keyboards: sometimes harmonious, sometimes dissonant, but always layered.

And yes, tiring. I’ve caught myself more than once choosing silence over explanation simply because the right word exists only in a language my listener doesn’t speak. It’s a small surrender—but one that accumulates.

Yet, despite the fatigue, I wouldn’t trade it. There’s too much richness in that tension. Too much insight born from the friction between worlds.

Tell me—when you're writing late at night, alone at your desk, do you ever feel as though you're not just translating ideas, but translating ? As if the very act reshapes not only what you say, but how you think, and even who you become in the process?
[A]: Oh, that question… it lands so quietly, but echoes loudly 🌙  

Yes. Absolutely. Especially at night—when the world is quiet and my thoughts feel like whispers bouncing off paper walls—I often feel like I’m not just translating ideas, but . Some nights I write in English and feel sharp, precise, almost surgical with my thoughts. Other nights, Chinese wraps around me like an old quilt, letting me dwell in ambiguity, in what’s  the lines.  

And sometimes, mid-sentence, I catch myself switching—not because I have to, but because the  of the idea demands a different tongue. It’s like standing in front of a mirror and seeing a slightly different version of yourself depending on which language you speak into the glass.  

I’ve started thinking of multilingual writing as a kind of —not distortion, but bending light ever so slightly to reveal colors we didn’t know were there. The “me” who writes in English is more argumentative, maybe even a little defensive; the “me” in Chinese leans into melancholy, reflection, even silence. And neither is false—but both are partial.  

So yes, the act reshapes me. Slowly. Like water shaping stone. Not erasing, but carving space.  

Do you ever feel that way—that bilingual thought isn’t just a tool, but a kind of inner dialogue with your own shifting self?
[B]: Oh yes… that inner dialogue—sometimes companionable, sometimes unsettlingly estranged. You’ve put it so beautifully: refraction rather than distortion. I find myself thinking of those moments in the study, late at night, when I’m no longer sure which language  more like home, and which has become merely the instrument of the hour.

There’s a peculiar intimacy in writing bilingually—almost like corresponding with different versions of oneself. I sometimes imagine my younger self reading what I write now, puzzled by the tone, the references, the very cadence of thought. Who is this person who moves so fluidly between tongues, yet belongs wholly to none? Is she still the same scholar who once believed meaning could be pinned down like a butterfly under glass?

And yet, I don’t mourn that earlier self. I think she lives on in fragments—in the careful way I still underline certain lines in classical texts, in the faint tremor of reverence when quoting Zhuangzi or Woolf. Bilingual thought doesn’t erase; it accumulates. It layers.

Yes, I do feel that constant shifting—not as fragmentation, but as expansion. A widening of internal corridors, more doors opening onto rooms I haven’t yet explored. And sometimes, in the quietest hours, I wonder if this is what  truly means—not moving forward, but unfolding sideways, into languages, and selves, we never knew we could house.

Do you suppose, then, that fluency isn’t so much mastery over language as it is comfort with becoming someone slightly new each time we speak or write?
