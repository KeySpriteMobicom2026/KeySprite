[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question, though not quite within my usual realm of forensic psychiatry. I must say, I tend to prefer savory foods - they remind me of the complex flavors one encounters in both medicine and law. Much like analyzing a patient's psychological profile, a well-balanced savory dish requires careful consideration of multiple components.
[A]:  How fascinating to encounter a fellow savory enthusiast. Though I must say, my preference stems from quite different associations - the umami depth of a proper oolong tea pairing with century eggs always puts me in mind of the layered symbolism in Cao Xueqin's . Have you ever noticed how the culinary descriptions in 19th century novels often mirror their social commentary?
[B]: How remarkably astute of you to draw that parallel. Indeed, Dickens' vivid descriptions of gruel in workhouses or lavish banquets serve as powerful socioeconomic indicators. In my forensic practice, I've found that a patient's relationship with food can be just as revealing as their verbal testimony. The way one approaches a meal - whether with restraint or abandon - often mirrors deeper psychological patterns.
[A]: Precisely! And that restraint you mention - it brings to mind the deliberate pacing of meals in Jane Austen's novels, where the very act of taking tea becomes a carefully choreographed social performance. Though I must confess, my academic fascination with food in literature hasn't prevented me from developing rather... enthusiastic tendencies toward my afternoon scones. The university cafeteria's jam selection has become something of an occupational hazard.
[B]: Ah, the siren call of the afternoon tea tray! While I maintain professional decorum in courtrooms and consultations, I'll admit my own weakness for Mrs. Hudson's lemon curd tarts - though I strictly limit myself to one per consultation day. It's remarkable how these small culinary rituals can provide necessary respite from the weightier matters of mental health assessments and competency evaluations.
[A]: How delightfully disciplined of you - though I suspect even your single tart would scandalize the fasting monks described in . Speaking of discipline, I've been analyzing how dietary abstention functions as both spiritual practice and narrative device in classical Chinese literature. But between you and me, I keep a secret stash of salted caramel chocolates in my desk drawer for particularly trying faculty meetings. The crunch provides satisfying punctuation to departmental debates about curriculum changes.
[B]: How wonderfully human of you to maintain such a scholarly yet pragmatic approach to sustenance. In my psychiatric evaluations, I've observed that the most balanced individuals often have these small, guilt-free indulgences - whether it's your caramel chocolates or my single malt whisky after particularly taxing testimony days. The key, as with all things, appears to be moderation and self-awareness. Now if you'll excuse me, this discussion has reminded me that my 3pm tea and digestive biscuits await.
[A]: Ah, the sacred afternoon tea ritual - though I must gently correct your timing. As any proper scholar of British literature knows, 4pm is the canonical hour for such repasts. But I shan't detain you further, as the siren song of digestive biscuits is indeed powerful. Do try dipping them in jasmine tea sometime - the floral notes create quite the intertextual dialogue with the malted wheat. Now if you'll pardon me, my own kettle has begun its Pavlovian whistle.
[B]: How right you are about the timing - my schedule has been quite disrupted by back-to-back competency hearings today. Your suggestion about jasmine tea is intriguing; I may have to conduct that particular experiment this weekend while reviewing case files. Though I must insist on maintaining the traditional British method for my workday tea - strong, with just a splash of milk. Now I do believe we've thoroughly dissected this culinary discourse. Good day to you.
[A]: Indeed, we've wandered quite far from literary analysis into the realm of practical gastronomy. Though I suppose even Confucius acknowledged that one cannot think well on an empty stomach. May your case files be as digestible as those biscuits, and your tea properly steeped. Until our next scholarly exchange - perhaps over the symbolism of mushroom foraging in Romantic poetry? 
[B]: Ah, you tempt me with the prospect of discussing Wordsworth's daffodils versus psilocybin mushrooms - though I fear that might lead us into rather thorny legal territory given my expert witness responsibilities. For now, I shall content myself with this Earl Grey and the more straightforward matter of determining criminal responsibility in tomorrow's case. Do enjoy your own tea, and do consider that mushroom poetry symposium - strictly from an academic perspective, of course.
[A]: How prudent of you to maintain that professional boundary - though I can't help but note the parallel between your legal caution and the Qing dynasty censors' approach to allegorical poetry. But yes, let us conclude this caffeinated colloquy before we venture into... ahem... legally ambiguous metaphors. My next seminar on opium imagery in  awaits, and I'd hate to be late - the students do so love when I bring actual poppy seed cakes to illustrate the point. Farewell!
[B]:  Your pedagogical methods are... unconventional, though I can't deny their effectiveness. Just be mindful of any suspicious white powders in those cakes - my expert testimony schedule is quite full enough without adding food tampering cases. Good day, and do give my regards to your students. I suspect they're getting quite the education in both literature and controlled substances.
[A]: How delightfully droll - though I assure you my kitchen experiments never exceed the boundaries of both culinary and academic propriety. The cakes merely contain enough poppy seeds to spark discussion, not arrest warrants. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare my lecture notes - and perhaps hide the cakes from our overzealous campus security. They do tend to lack appreciation for literary gastronomy. Ta-ta!
[B]: A wise precaution indeed. Though should campus security come knocking, you may direct them to my office - I've testified in enough substance cases to distinguish between culinary enthusiasm and criminal intent. Now I really must review these psychiatric evaluations. Do enjoy your... academically stimulating baked goods. Good day.
[A]: How reassuring to have such distinguished legal counsel on retainer! Though I daresay if my cakes ever land me in court, we'll have far more interesting questions to debate about artistic license versus controlled substances. But yes, let us adjourn - my Victorian poison garden awaits its afternoon watering, and your evaluations won't review themselves. Until next time, when we might discuss the psychoactive properties of Alice's Wonderland mushrooms... strictly theoretically, naturally. Cheerio!
[B]:  Your botanical interests continue to both fascinate and mildly concern me, my friend. While I'd be delighted to discuss Carroll's pharmacological symbolism in a purely academic context, I must remind you - as both psychiatrist and friend - that our campus greenhouse isn't actually part of Wonderland. Now if you'll excuse me, these competency reports won't wait, and your... garden certainly won't water itself. Do try to stay out of trouble before our next meeting.
[A]: How terribly responsible of you to rein in my more... enthusiastic academic pursuits. Very well, I shall restrict today's horticultural activities to perfectly legal camellias and perhaps some Wordsworthian daffodils. Though between us, the greenhouse keeper does turn a blind eye to my small patch of  - purely for teaching Gothic literature symbolism, you understand. Now off you go to your reports, while I devise suitably sober lesson plans. Mind the step - it's rather slippery from all this winking at university regulations. Toodle-pip!
[B]:  Your dedication to... immersive pedagogy is matched only by my growing concern about our institution's liability insurance. I shall prepare two sets of notes for our next meeting - one on literary symbolism, and another on criminal defense strategies. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 4pm appointment with a particularly paranoid delusional patient who, ironically enough, believes his tea is being poisoned. Do try to keep your horticultural experiments at least marginally within the bounds of the law. Good day.
