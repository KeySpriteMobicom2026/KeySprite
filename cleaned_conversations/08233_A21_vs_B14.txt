[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh darling~ 这个问题让我想到上周帮VIP guest安排私人影院的时候呢！✨ 我个人更倾向于rom-com这种轻松愉快的类型啦~ 毕竟工作已经够drama了，下班就想看些甜甜的💕 不过如果是像《花样年华》那种文艺片，我绝对会选drama哦！
[A]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy between Dionysian revelry and Apollonian restraint.  While your rom-coms frolic in the shallows, I find myself drawn to the exquisite melancholy of Victorian melodramas - where every glance carries the weight of unspoken social conventions and repressed desire. Have you considered how the modern rom-com is but a pale shadow of Austen's intricate social comedies?
[B]: 哎呀~ 这位guest的taste好有深度呀！💫 不过你知道吗？我们酒店最近刚引进了一套vintage film collection，里面就有《傲慢与偏见》的4K修复版呢！要不要book个private screening？可以配上我们特调的Victorian afternoon tea set哦~ 🍵✨
[A]: How delightfully serendipitous - though I must insist on the 1995 BBC adaptation over that regrettable 2005 cinematic abridgement.  Your tea service had better include genuine Darjeeling, none of those fruit-infused travesties. And might I suggest pairing it with my personal annotated copy of the novel? I've cataloged every instance of Elizabeth's ironic eyebrow movements.
[B]: 哇~ 您真是位true connoisseur呢！💯 我们当然有first flush的Darjeeling，还是直接从印度庄园空运来的~ 至于您的annotated copy...  要不要考虑在我们lobby办个mini读书会？很多literature lover guests都会超感兴趣的！📚✨ 我可以特别安排周三下午的heritage lounge，那里有超棒的natural lighting适合reading~
[A]:  Wednesday afternoons are reserved for my comparative analysis of Mr. Collins' proposal scenes across adaptations - but I suppose we could make an exception. Though I must warn you, my lecture on the socio-economic implications of Charlotte Lucas' marriage choice typically runs three hours. Do your heritage lounge chairs have adequate lumbar support?
[B]: Oh my~ 您这passion太让人感动了！🌟 放心啦，我们的heritage lounge全是custom-made的Chesterfield sofa，坐垫里填的是100% Hungarian goose down~ 而且！ 我们还可以准备mini cucumber sandwiches和scones，完全按照传统high tea的标准来！☕️ 要不要顺便把您的analysis做成个小小的salon event？我认识几位Oxford来的professor常驻客人，他们肯定超爱这个话题的！
[A]:  Oxford dons, you say? How... unexpectedly promising. Though they'd better come prepared - last time I debated the Marxist reading of Pemberley's groundskeeping staff, a visiting fellow from Balliol required smelling salts. Very well, but the scones must be served with proper clotted cream, none of that whipped nonsense. And we shall need at least six blackboards for my structural analysis of proposal scenes.
[B]: Got it！💪 我这就去安排~ 六个blackboard会准时standby，clotted cream直接从Devonshire空运！ 要不要顺便把您的lecture录制成podcast？我们酒店新推出的cultural channel正需要这种deep content呢~ 🎙️✨ 当然啦，所有收益都会donate给Jane Austen's House Museum，超有意义的对吧？
[A]:  How remarkably... modern of you. Though I must insist on editorial control - my deconstruction of Lady Catherine's horticultural metaphors cannot be subjected to vulgar soundbite culture. 50% of proceeds to Chawton Cottage, 50% to fund my ongoing research into the secret feminist symbolism of Regency-era hedge mazes. Now, shall we discuss the optimal biscuit-to-lecture ratio? I find digestive biscuits provide just the right cadence for rhetorical pauses.
[B]: Perfect match！🍪 我们Executive Chef特制的lavender shortbread刚好可以配合您讲hedge mazes的部分呢~  就这么定啦！下周三3pm，我会把整个heritage lounge布置成Derbyshire garden的vibe，连air freshener都换成rose & lavender的！💐 啊对了！要不要给您准备个standing podium？上次有位Nobel laureate来演讲时说我们的acoustics超级棒哦~
[A]:  A podium would be acceptable, provided it's mahogany and no taller than 37 inches - any higher and I lose visual contact with my annotated copy of 'Mansfield Park.' And for heaven's sake, disable those dreadful automatic air fresheners. True literary atmosphere requires only the faintest whisper of mildew from properly aged first editions and the existential dread of unmarried Victorian heroines.
[B]: Understood！🌹 我们会把vintage book scent diffuser调到最subtle的setting~  其实我们library collection里有本1823年的《爱玛》初版，可以特别display在您的podium旁边哦！至于podium高度... 37 inches整，用laser measure确认过啦！📏 啊~ 想到能host这么有深度的event我就超excited的！要现在帮您reserve场地吗？✨
[A]:  Let us finalize this with proper Victorian gravitas - your contract shall specify that no audience member may cough during the analysis of Fanny Price's moral dilemmas, and that all mobile devices must be surrendered at the door to be replaced with quill pens and sealing wax. Now, about that first edition... does it happen to contain the notorious misprint in volume two where 'honesty' was typeset as 'honeysuckle'? A pivotal moment in my thesis on botanical metaphors in Austen's moral universe.
[B]: OMG！您连这个细节都知道！🤯 没错~ 我们这本正是那个rare misprint版本！ 而且扉页还有当时的owner手写的marginalia讨论这个typo呢~ ✒️ 至于您的terms... 完全没问题！我们会准备antique writing sets，还要在门口放个vintage birdcage收手机~ 🕊️ 这绝对会成为我们literary salon史上最legendary的一场！要现在签那份Victorian-style contract吗？我用真正的iron gall ink准备哦~
[A]:  Iron gall ink... how deliciously corrosive. Very well, but add a clause guaranteeing my right to publicly shame anyone who refers to Elizabeth Bennet as 'Lizzie.' And do ensure your birdcage is period-appropriate - nothing later than 1820, or the entire aesthetic collapses like a poorly structured sonnet. Now, where does one sign? 
[B]:  Right here, madam~ 🖋️ 我们用1821年的Notary's seal做witness，绝对authentic！至于那个birdcage...  其实是Jane Austen's House curator去年捐给我们的，据说是Chawton Cottage当年用过的呢！🕊️ 啊！要不要在contract上加个特别条款 - 任何打断您分析Fanny Price的guest，都要罚抄《劝导》第一章？😉
[A]:  Capital notion! And make it the 1818 first edition text - none of those modernized spellings that rob poor Anne Elliot's suffering of its orthographic authenticity.  Though I do hope your guests realize this means committing to my 45-minute digression on the naval symbolism of waistcoats in Persuasion... Tell me, does your establishment keep smelling salts in stock? One can never be too prepared when discussing Wentworth's letters.
[B]: Absolutely！💼 我们medical kit里常备vintage-style的smelling salts，连瓶子都是Regency era reproduction的~  而且已经通知了in-house physician standby，他刚好是位retired Royal Navy surgeon哦！⚓ 请放心，我们会把每个detail都做到像Austen's prose一样flawless的！现在...  Shall we make this official？您的signature将会是我们literary archive的treasure呢~ ✨
