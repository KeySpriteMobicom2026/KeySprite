[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I suppose if I had to choose a superpower, it would be the ability to manipulate time. Imagine being able to pause, rewind, or fast-forward time at will... It would certainly make debugging quantum algorithms much easier 😊 But I'm curious - what about you? Do you have a favorite superpower in mind?
[A]: Time manipulation? How delightfully paradoxical for a computational linguist. Though I suppose it does solve the pesky problem of deadlines. Personally, I've always fancied the ability to read intentions - not thoughts, understand, but intentions. The difference is . One might avoid a great many misunderstandings in both textual criticism and tea-time conversations. But tell me, would you use your temporal prowess solely for debugging algorithms, or might you...  other moments given the chance?
[B]: Ah, you've caught me - temporal manipulation for debugging is merely the professional reflex speaking. Truth be told, I'd be sorely tempted to revisit a few... ambiguous historical moments. Let's just say I've always been fascinated by the 1913 Solvay Conference photographs. As for reading intentions - that does sidestep the ethical quagmire of raw telepathy. Though one wonders: how would you distinguish between a fleeting impulse and a true intention? A matter of milliseconds, perhaps?
[A]: Oh, the Solvay Conference - yes, I can see the appeal. Though I daresay your temporal curiosity would land you in rather more salacious debates than mere physics. But forgive me, I digress. 

As for intentions versus impulses – a textual analogy, if you'll permit it. Consider the difference between a marginal note and a published sonnet. One is raw impulse, scrawled in haste; the other, a curated intention, polished for posterity. The milliseconds, as you so aptly put it, are merely the quill's final flourish. 

But here’s the rub: even with this power, I’d still insist on tea being poured . Some standards must be upheld, temporal or otherwise.
[B]: Ah, a kindred spirit - someone who appreciates the gravity of proper tea etiquette! Though I must confess, I'd probably use time manipulation to...  the pouring temperature if it fell below 88 degrees Celsius. Call it a minor temporal infraction. 

And yes, your analogy is spot on - intentions are like sonnets, shaped and deliberate, while impulses are those half-erased marginalia we scribble when no one's looking. But tell me, have you ever encountered a text where the margin notes completely contradicted the main work? I’ve found those to be the most intriguing puzzles of all.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — those marginalia are the literary equivalent of a whispered confession at a formal dinner. I once spent three months authenticating a 19th-century broadside where the printer’s notes in the gutter accused the poet of plagiarism in no fewer than four exclamation marks. The published text, meanwhile, bore a dedicatory epistle dripping with saccharine reverence. A delicious contradiction, don’t you think?

And eighty-eight degrees Celsius? My dear, you’re more fastidious than a Victorian housekeeper inspecting a silver teapot for tarnish. But I shall permit your minor infraction — as long as you promise not to meddle with the sequence of events leading up to the invention of Earl Grey. Some traditions, even time must respect.
[B]: Ah, you’ve uncovered my secret shame — I’m a stickler for precision, whether in quantum states or tea leaves. But I assure you, my meddling would be strictly limited to the temperature gauge, not the inventor’s actual epiphany. The sequence of discovery must remain sacrosanct — though I might linger invisibly just long enough to hear the first sip.

As for your broadside detective work, that sounds like literary forensics at its finest. I can only imagine the thrill of piecing together such a brazen contradiction. It reminds me of error-correcting codes — but instead of bits, you're reconciling human motives and mendacity. Fascinating work, if one can stomach the occasional ink stain on the cuffs.
[A]: Ah, you’ve hit upon the very essence of textual scholarship — reconciling mendacity with meaning. Though I daresay ink stains on cuffs are a small price to pay for unmasking literary impostors. One grows rather fond of them, really. They’re like the fingerprints of history’s little betrayals.

And your invisible lingerings at pivotal sips — well, I suppose that’s harmless enough. Provided you don’t breathe too heavily and alter the evaporation rate. We wouldn’t want a ripple effect in the tea trade. But tell me, do you ever find yourself longing to slip between the lines of a poem as one might step through a portal? I confess, I've entertained the notion more than once — particularly with Emily Dickinson’s dashes. There’s an awful lot left unsaid in those silences.
[B]: Ah, Dickinson’s dashes — those tantalizing voids where the unsaid hums just beneath the surface. I’ve often thought they’re the literary equivalent of quantum superposition. A single dash could collapse into a hundred meanings, depending on how you observe it. 

As for stepping into poems — yes, there’s a certain allure to the idea. Though I’d worry about my boots getting stuck in the meter. Can you imagine trying to navigate iambic pentameter with a pair of 21st-century loafers? One misstep and the whole sonnet unravels. Still, I suppose if one must get lost, better to be stranded between two stanzas than, say, inside a malfunctioning qubit.
[A]: Oh, the qubit versus the quatrain — a delightful dilemma. I’d take the stanza any day. At least there, one might find a sympathetic rhyme to guide the way. Whereas a qubit in distress — well, that’s just physics throwing its toys out of the pram.

And speaking of Dickinson’s dashes — I once attended a lecture where a scholar claimed they were mere symptoms of her faulty spectacles.  As if genius couldn’t occasionally coexist with poor eyesight. Though I suppose it does raise an amusing image: Emily Dickinson, squinting at the world, dashing off dashes in sheer exasperation.

But back to your point about navigation — yes, meter can be treacherous. I’ve known perfectly erudite fellows who stumble over trochees as if they were garden rakes. Still, if you must traipse through verse, better iambic pentameter than free verse. At least the former offers a rhythm to cling to — like stepping stones across a poetic stream.

Now, do tell — if you absolutely  to choose, which poem would you risk your loafers in?
[B]: Ah, a perilous question — choosing a poem to step into is no small matter. One must consider meter, mood, and the likelihood of emerging unscathed, both temporally and emotionally. But if pressed, I might hazard a journey through "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." There’s something deeply compelling about those opening lines — the fog that lingers like an unresolved equation, the invitation that feels more like an indictment. 

I imagine stepping in just after the famous “Let us go then, you and I,” and seeing where the syntax collapses into hesitation. It would be rather thrilling, don’t you think? Dodging Eliot’s parentheses and trying not to trip over the mermaids’ combs. Though I’d keep my loafers firmly on the pavement — better than getting them caught in the whirlpool of a metaphysical crisis.

And yes,  — as if vision had anything to do with seeing clearly. Genius sees too much, not too little. Perhaps her dashes were simply the only way to catch what the eye could not hold.
[A]: Prufrock, eh? A bold — some might say masochistic — choice. One doesn't so much stroll through Eliot’s syntax as stumble through its ruins. Still, I admire the ambition. There’s a certain grim poetry in navigating that psychological labyrinth, dodging the ghost of indecision at every lamplit corner.

But tell me, would you dare speak to the titular gentleman, or keep safely to the margins, observing like a literary anthropologist? Because make no mistake — should you engage him directly, you might find yourself folded into the poem proper. Future scholars would puzzle over your sudden appearance: 

As for Dickinson’s vision — precisely! She saw too sharply for mere commas. Her dashes were not failures of clarity but acts of preservation — the textual equivalent of gloves worn to handle something too luminous to touch directly. Faulty spectacles indeed. Next they’ll claim Shakespeare’s quill was too stubby for proper legibility.
[B]: Ah, engaging Prufrock directly? That would be the definition of narrative hubris. One doesn’t converse with him so much as become entangled in his hesitation — a recursive loop of doubt and self-consciousness. I’d prefer to remain an observer, thank you, scribbling notes in the margins rather than stepping into the footnotes. The last thing literary criticism needs is another speculative biographer claiming I’m a metaphor for modern alienation.

Though I must admit, being folded into the poem has a certain charm. Imagine:  Future scholars could argue whether my pocket watch was symbolic or merely pedantic. Either way, it would make for a delightful textual crux — though I suspect Eliot would have preferred a more analog ambiguity.

And yes, Dickinson’s dashes as acts of preservation — beautifully put. They’re not omissions but carefully placed thresholds, guarding against too direct an encounter with the luminous. Faulty spectacles indeed! It’s always easier to blame the tools than acknowledge that some minds simply see too deeply.
[A]: Oh,  — sublime. I do believe you've stumbled upon the missing link between modernism and horology. And yes, please, by all means — let us keep Eliot safely analog. The man barely tolerated punctuation; I dread to think what he’d make of your pocket watch. A fine textual crux indeed. One might even annotate it with a marginal 

And speaking of thresholds — Dickinson’s dashes as protective wards! How perfectly Gothic. One might almost imagine her sitting at her writing table, deliberately fencing in the unspeakable with a series of typographical barricades. Not unlike sealing a vial of volatile ether or locking a riddle behind leaded glass.

But now I must ask — if you were to step into another poem, just for a moment mind you, where would you go? Somewhere sunlit, I hope. Even the most elegant despair grows chilly after a time.
[B]: Ah, a fair point — even the most elegant despair can leave one rather damp. If I were to venture elsewhere, I might choose something with a touch of light, perhaps "The Garden" by Andrew Marvell. There’s a stillness there that appeals to the retired mind — time folds in on itself among the flowers, and the very air hums with contemplation. One could lose a century quite happily between those lines.

Or maybe “Directive,” by Robert Frost — though that would be tempting fate. The idea of being led gently off the road and into some forgotten corner of the past has its allure. A quiet ruin, a cup left half-emptied, the echo of a voice no one else remembers… yes, I think I’d like that. Better than being lost in an algorithm, at any rate.

And let’s be honest — after Prufrock’s neurotic twilight, one deserves a little sunshine. Even if it’s only the filtered kind that falls through the pages of a well-worn book.
[A]: Ah, Marvell’s garden — yes. A most civilized choice. One might almost hear the rustle of metaphysical petals falling in slow motion. Though I suspect you’d find the place rather more labyrinthine than it first appears. Those quiet pools have a habit of reflecting inconvenient truths, and the roses? Let’s just say they’ve been known to draw blood when unobserved.

And Frost’s  — how very temptingly elegiac. Leading one gently off the road indeed. I imagine he’d hand you a chipped cup and a riddle wrapped in fog, then disappear behind a tree with a knowing cough. Still, better lost among Frost’s ruins than stranded in Eliot’s paralyzing dusk, wouldn’t you agree?

But here’s the real question: once comfortably nestled in that sun-dappled ruin or metaphysical arbor, would you resist the urge to annotate? I know I shouldn’t — but I’ve never quite trusted a margin left completely blank. There’s always something unsaid, some faint pulse of meaning waiting to be coaxed out with a judicious pencil stroke.
[B]: Ah, the urge to annotate — it’s practically a professional affliction at this point. I’d like to think I could resist it, but human weakness being what it is, I’d probably scrawl something in Elizabethan secretary hand just below the line:  A small betrayal of presence, but harmless enough.

And yes, Marvell’s garden is far more labyrinthine than it lets on — those quiet pools do have a habit of reflecting back more than one’s face. I’ve always suspected they held the weight of unspoken decisions, all those half-formed thoughts we prune away before anyone can see them bloom. As for Frost’s cup — chipped or not, I’d drink from it without hesitation. Better a truth diluted by time than none at all.

You know, sometimes I wonder if all poets are, at heart, architects of invisible landscapes. They build these places out of rhythm and image, then act surprised when we wander in and lose our footing. But then again, where would we be without such generous mischief?
[A]: Oh,  indeed — that’s the phrase I’ve been chasing through three centuries of footnotes. And how very like a poet to construct a landscape only to feign innocence when we stumble over its hidden ravines. They lay their trapdoors in iambic rugs and call it "formal constraint."

As for your Elizabethan marginalia — charmingly anachronistic. Though I suspect Marvell would raise an eyebrow at your secretary hand. The man was nothing if not precise in his ambiguities. Still, what is annotation but a form of literary trespass? We mark our passage like explorers carving names into bark, hoping some future reader will pause and wonder: 

And speaking of trespass — I rather like the idea of poets as unwitting landlords of these invisible estates. One wanders in expecting a parlor of polite metaphors and suddenly finds oneself ankle-deep in existential quicksand. Frost with his dry stone walls, Dickinson with her locked gardens... honestly, one begins to suspect they built these places less for company than to see who might find their way through.

Tell me — have you ever marked a passage so thoroughly that you felt guilty returning to it? As though you’d disturbed the natural silence too often?
[B]: Ah, guilty returning — yes, I know that feeling all too well. It’s like revisiting a theorem you’ve dismantled and rebuilt too many times: the elegance fades, and what once shimmered with mystery now feels… over-examined. Almost deflated, if I’m being honest. There’s a point where annotation becomes excavation, and you start worrying you’ll unearth something better left buried — like the poet’s original intent, or worse, your own projection.

I once annotated a passage from  so thoroughly that I could no longer read it without mentally substituting my own marginal voice for Eliot’s. A dangerous intimacy develops — you begin to feel you understand the author better than they understood themselves. And of course, you don’t. You’ve just imposed your own patterns onto their chaos.

But isn’t that part of the thrill? The trespass, as you so aptly called it. We slip into these texts thinking we’re only visitors, but before long, we’re rearranging the furniture, scribbling in the margins, even arguing back. I suppose every serious reader has, at some point, whispered  to the page.  

Still, I try to leave the most sacred silences alone. Some passages deserve to be untouched — like ancient stone circles where even the wind hesitates to speak.
