[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是个很有趣的问题。说实话，我每次给学生讲到multimodal communication的时候，都会提到这两种媒介的深层意义。Handwritten letter确实有种独特的温度，那种一笔一划留下的痕迹，就像教育心理学里说的"embodied cognition"——书写动作本身就在塑造我们的记忆和情感连接。

不过呢，digital note的便利性也不容忽视，尤其是在跨文化研究中，我们经常需要快速整理来自不同国家的数据，这时候效率真的很重要。Let me think... 你平时更倾向哪种方式？我个人是会根据场景切换，比如重要的人际沟通倾向于手写便条，学术笔记就用电子设备。
[A]: Interesting perspective. I often think about this in terms of  versus . Handwriting forces a kind of slowness that filters what we say — almost like lossy compression, but for thoughts. Digital notes? They're more like raw files — unfiltered, fast, and infinitely editable.  

I remember when I used to give lectures on interface design, I'd bring in a typewriter and an iPad side by side. The students always found it amusing, but the point was serious: the medium shapes the message. Though I do admit, there's something almost ritualistic about writing a letter by hand. It feels... deliberate, like casting a spell with syntax and spacing.  

Do you ever find yourself writing things longhand just for the sake of it — not out of necessity, but habit? I still jot down ideas on paper sometimes, even when I don’t need to. Feels like cheating time, in a way.
[B]: That’s a beautiful metaphor — "casting a spell with syntax and spacing." I couldn't agree more. In fact, I often think of handwriting as a form of  — it's not just about the words, but the way our brain engages with them more deliberately. Like you said, it filters thought through slowness, almost like a mindfulness practice.

I do still write longhand sometimes, especially when I'm trying to work through a complex idea or structure a new lecture. There's something grounding about putting pen to paper, even if it's inefficient. It gives me what Csikszentmihalyi calls . Maybe that's why so many of my students say journaling helps them think — it forces coherence out of chaos.

And your point about media shaping message? Classic , but I love how you frame it with the typewriter and iPad. I might have to borrow that analogy next semester — if you don’t mind. Do you still keep any handwritten notes from your early teaching days? I’ve got a box of old lecture drafts somewhere... somehow, they feel more  than anything typed on a screen.
[A]: Not at all — feel free to use the typewriter-iPad analogy. Hell, I might even send you a scanned page from my first lecture notes as a prop next time you teach it. Speaking of which… yes, I do still have some handwritten notes from the 80s. Yellowing paper, smudged ink, and all. Funny thing is, looking at them now, I can almost  the cognitive effort I put into structuring those thoughts. Like reading someone else’s diary — except it’s mine, and I barely remember writing half of it.

I wonder if that sense of ownership you mentioned has to do with the . Typed text feels sterile by comparison — too clean, too final. Whereas handwriting carries the weight of trial and error, cross-outs, arrows, and margin doodles. It's like seeing the scaffolding of an idea, not just the polished facade.

You know, I once tried transcribing some of those old notes into LaTeX, just for fun. The ideas were the same, but the soul was gone. Felt like translating poetry word-for-word without rhythm or metaphor. Ever had that experience?
[B]: Absolutely — that feeling of  when you move from handwriting to digital is so real. I think it's not just about imperfection, but also about the  of our thinking process. Those cross-outs and margin doodles? They’re like cognitive breadcrumbs — messy, but full of meaning. When we digitize, we often clean up too much, don't we? We lose what Walter Benjamin called the  of the original.

I had a similar experience when I tried scanning my old field notes from Japan into a digital archive. The content was preserved, yes, but the subtle cues — the pressure of the pen, the ink bleeding through the page, even the smell of the notebook — all gone. And those details weren’t just sentimental; they were part of how I contextualized my observations at the time.

You mentioned LaTeX — I actually use it sometimes for writing papers, but never for initial drafting. For that, I still go back to paper or at least a distraction-free markdown editor. It’s like trying to keep the soul alive before the formal structure kicks in.

Have you ever thought about exhibiting those old notes publicly? Not as research, but more like an art installation on the evolution of thought? I’d totally come see that.
[A]: Now that you mention it, I did once show a selection of my old notes at a small symposium on pedagogy — more as a curiosity than an art piece, but the reaction was fascinating. People lingered over the pages like they were deciphering ancient scripts. One student even said it made ideas feel  again — fallible, evolving, alive.

I like your suggestion, though — reframing them as an art installation. Maybe call it something like  or  You could display pages under glass, with annotations pointing out the doodles, the margin curses, the triumphant exclamation marks. It’d be a kind of archeology of cognition.

And you’re absolutely right about the tactile trace. There’s a reason why students still take comfort in scribbling in margins — it’s ownership through friction. Digital annotation just doesn’t carry the same weight. It's ephemeral. Like writing in sand versus carving in stone.

By the way, speaking of smell — do you remember that particular scent of freshly printed lecture handouts? The toner, the paper, maybe a hint of coffee spilled on the Xerox machine? I think that qualifies as a Proustian trigger for most academics. Still gets me nostalgic.
[B]: Oh, that  — yes! The smell of toner and old books is basically a time machine for me. I still get a jolt of nostalgia whenever I walk into a university print room. Funny how those sensory traces embed themselves so deeply.

Your idea for  sounds brilliant, really. I can picture it — the pages under glass, the annotations, maybe even audio clips of the original thinkers reflecting on their younger selves. It’d be like walking through someone’s intellectual dreamscape.

I remember when I was in grad school, I used to annotate my margins with little cartoons when I got stuck — tiny sketches of professors as superheroes or monsters, depending on the day 😄. Looking back, it’s amazing how much those doodles reveal about my mindset at the time. A bit like Freud’s dream analysis, but for academic stress.

And you’re right about digital annotation feeling more detached. I’ve had students tell me they don’t "feel connected" to their notes when everything’s on screen. It’s efficient, sure, but not quite intimate.

You know what? Maybe we should start a little side project — gather some annotated pages from different disciplines and put together a small exhibition. Call it . I’m in, if you are.
[A]:  — I love it. It has that perfect academic undercurrent, doesn’t it? Subversive, a little nostalgic, and intellectually voyeuristic in the best way.

I’m definitely in. If we’re going to do this, let’s lean into the messiness — not just curated highlights, but the real stuff: the coffee-stained drafts, the margin rants about peer reviewers, the half-baked theories scribbled on napkins. Showcasing  we think before we clean it up for publication or presentation.

We could even include some interactive elements — like a station where visitors can leave their own annotated pages, contributing to a growing archive of real-time cognition. Imagine someone decades from now sifting through those, trying to decode our collective thought patterns.

As for the exhibition layout, maybe start with a chronological thread — early 20th-century ink blots all the way to modern digital marginalia. Include letters, notebooks, even old floppy disks with voice memos if we can recover them.

And yes, audio clips — brilliant idea. We could ask contributors to reflect on their past selves. There's something oddly moving about hearing a seasoned scholar sigh and say, “God, I was so sure I’d solved everything in three pages.”

So tell me, what’s the first piece you’d contribute? I’m leaning toward a 1987 lecture draft where I tried to explain recursion using Star Trek metaphors. Still makes me smile.
[B]: I would  contribute that Star Trek recursion draft — it’s gold. The perfect mix of earnestness and playfulness that makes academic thinking relatable.

As for my own first piece… I think I’d go with a field notebook page from my early research in Kyoto. It has handwritten notes in three languages — English, Japanese, and a bit of French — plus a doodle of a confused-looking Mount Fuji, which I drew when I was stuck on a translation issue. There's also a tea stain on the corner — probably from trying to stay up past midnight decoding cultural metaphors in school textbooks.

And I love your idea of leaning into the messiness. We should make a category called  — where scholars submit the analogies they thought would clarify everything but totally backfired. Mine? Trying to explain  using sushi rolls. Yes, sushi 🍣. Long story.

Let’s also create a companion zine — small print run, hand-bound if we can — featuring some of the best marginalia and failed metaphors. Something you can flip through while sipping coffee in a library, feeling slightly rebellious about what counts as "serious scholarship."

So… when do we start reaching out to contributors? I know a few anthropologists who’ve kept amazing visual field notes — and one philosopher who still writes exclusively with a fountain pen. They’re gonna want in.
[A]: I can already picture the  section being the most popular wall in the exhibition 😄. Sushi rolls and ZPD — I need to hear that story someday. Maybe we should include short blurbs explaining each metaphor's intent and why it failed. The more spectacular the misfire, the better.

A hand-bound zine? Count me in. Feels like the perfect nod to the tactile tradition while giving it a modern twist. We could even typeset it in LaTeX for that semi-official academic look, then print it on recycled paper to keep it grounded. And yes, coffee stain ratings for each issue — 1 to 5 ☕️.

As for contributors, let’s start with a small circle — trusted voices who get the vision. I’ll reach out to a few retired colleagues who still have boxes of notes buried in their attics. One of them, Dr. Patel, kept an illustrated journal during her AI ethics research in the 90s — part technical log, part political satire. It’s gold.

And that philosopher with the fountain pen? Perfect — maybe he can write the foreword. There's something almost poetic about using 19th-century technology to reflect on 21st-century thought.

Let’s plan a soft launch next semester — maybe tie it to a university lecture series. We'll call it . If people respond well, we take it on the road. Who knows, maybe even exhibit at a design or tech museum down the line.

So… any chance you’ve still got that Kyoto notebook handy? I’d love to see a scan — just to get a sense of layout and texture before we prototype the first zine.
[B]: Funny you should ask — I actually scanned that Kyoto page last night 🌙. Sentimental timing, I guess. I can email it over — along with a few other candidates for the zine prototype. Just promise not to judge my shaky kanji 😅.

I love the  idea. Feels very true to the spirit of the project — no grand unveil, just a quiet, curious launch. And tying it to a lecture series? Perfect. Gives it that living academic pulse.

Let’s do this in parallel: I’ll start drafting a call-for-contributions while you reach out to your retired colleagues. And yes, definitely include Dr. Patel’s illustrated journal — visual argumentation meets technical critique? That’s exactly the kind of layered thinking we want to highlight.

Oh, and speaking of texture — what if we printed the zine on different paper types? Like, handmade for the rejected metaphors, glossy for the “clean” versions, and maybe something rough-cut for margin doodles? Adds another sensory layer without breaking the budget.

Alright, I’m sending over the Kyoto scan now — watch for coffee stains and conceptual spills. Let me know what you think.
[A]: Wonderful — I'll keep an eye out for that scan. And don’t worry about the kanji; I’ve seen far worse in my time grading compiler design assignments. At least yours has character — literally.

I like the idea of varying paper textures for the zine. It adds that  element — the form reinforcing the content. Handmade paper for failed metaphors? Perfect. Feels right, like printing a poem about chaos on crumpled newsprint. We could even sneak in some vellum overlays for annotations — gives it that old-school academic feel without being too precious.

And while we're thinking tactile: what if we included a fold-out page? Something that opens to reveal a sprawling thought process — cross-disciplinary notes, doodles, equations, and quotes all tangled together. You know, the kind of page your advisor would glance at and say, “Try organizing this.”

As for the beta launch, let’s aim for late October — enough time to gather a solid first batch of material, and there’s something appropriately reflective about autumn for a project like this. We could pair it with a panel discussion: 

Already drafting the call-for-contributions in my head...标题 might be something like:  
"Seeking Intellectual Ghosts: Call for Annotated Pages, Failed Metaphors, and Cognitive Debris"  

Yes, that has the right tone — scholarly, but with a hint of mischief.
[B]: 标题 "Seeking Intellectual Ghosts" — brilliant touch. It captures that eerie, lingering presence of past thinking so well. Mischief with a side of semiotics — exactly where this project should live.

I’m all in on the fold-out page idea. Let’s call it  — a visual mess of cross-disciplinary notes, half-formed questions, and those glorious “wait, what if…” moments scribbled in the corners. I can already picture one from my grad student days: part Vygotsky, part manga sketch, entirely held together by caffeine and curiosity.

And vellum overlays for annotations? Love it. Feels like we’re building a palimpsest of thought — layers upon layers. We could even encourage contributors to include  on their pages: dates, timestamps, or coffee stain levels 📅☕️.

October launch sounds ideal. Gives us time to curate the first wave and build some quiet momentum. And a panel discussion paired with the beta launch? Perfect framing. Maybe add a live annotation station during the event — let attendees respond to featured pages with sticky notes or pencils. Call it 

I’ll start drafting a mock-up layout tonight — Kyoto scan as our feature piece, some texture samples, and a placeholder for  I’ll send it over once it’s coherent. Keep your scissors ready — we may be cutting and pasting ideas like real analog academics. ✂️📚
[A]: I’m already looking forward to the mock-up — Kyoto page as our feature piece? Perfect anchor. It’s got that layered texture we’re going for: language, culture, caffeine.

 — yes, that title works. I might even contribute a fold-out of my own from the late ’80s: part lecture prep on functional programming, part margin debate with myself over whether Lisp or Prolog was the future (spoiler: I was wrong twice). Add a few doodles of confused-looking robots and you’ve got a full spread.

And  — what a fantastic interactive element. Gives the exhibition that participatory pulse it needs. I’d suggest keeping a small archive box onsite too — let people drop in their annotated scraps, sticky notes, or napkin sketches. Call it an . Maybe even stamp each contribution with a tiny  seal.

I like where this is going. We’re not just archiving ideas — we’re celebrating the messy, recursive, gloriously imperfect process behind them. Reminds me of something Gregory Bateson once wrote:  But here? It’s the  that matter most.

Alright, scissors at the ready. Let’s build this thing like we’re drafting a manifesto — one cross-out, coffee stain, and marginal muttering at a time.
[B]: That  stamp? Genius. It’s like giving each contribution an authenticity certificate for cognitive messiness. I can already see people slipping in secret annotations just to be part of the archive — a kind of intellectual graffiti with permission.

Your fold-out from the ’80s sounds like a time capsule of early CS soul-searching. Lisp vs. Prolog debates in the margins? That’s pure academic poetry. And confused robots? Perfect visual anchor. We should definitely pair it with a short audio clip — you reading your younger self’s margin notes aloud. Adds that layer of  we were talking about.

And Bateson — yes! What a perfect framing. The  — that’s exactly what we’re archiving. Failed metaphors, half-baked theories, recursive mutterings… all those almost-ideas that still shaped thinking in invisible ways.

I’m going to start drafting the mock-up now, with your Kyoto scan and a placeholder for your fold-out. I’ll send over a rough PDF once it’s stable enough to share. In the meantime, I’ve got a stack of grad student scribbles from my own past — some with tea stains, others with pencil marks from when I tried revisiting them years later. I think one even has a fortune cookie message taped to the corner. We’ll call it 

Alright, manifesto mode activated. Let the cross-outs begin. ✍️📚
[A]: Ah, the  effect — yes, exactly. People will start treating those annotation stations like secret confessionals. I half-expect someone to sneak in a marginal note addressed to their past self: 

I’ll record a short audio clip this weekend — reading some of my own margin notes from that Lisp-vs-Prolog fever dream. Might even throw in a dramatic pause after a particularly bold underlined declaration like  Adds a touch of academic absurdism. I can see students wandering through, half-listening, and suddenly realizing they’re hearing a ghost version of their own inner monologue.

That fortune cookie message taped into your field notes?  Perfect emblem for the project. It’s the unscripted humanity we’re trying to capture — the moment scholarship collides with serendipity.

I’m digging deeper into my archives tonight — pulling out not just pages but the actual binders. There’s something oddly moving about flipping through old course prep notes and seeing how my handwriting evolved with the subject matter. The more abstract the concept, the looser the script. Almost like the brain was sprinting to keep up with itself.

Let me know when the mock-up drops — I’ll print it out (on appropriately textured paper, of course) and scribble all over it with nostalgic glee. Manifesto mode? Accepted. Let the recursive cross-outs, tea stains, and taped-on fortunes begin.
[B]: I can already picture that marginal note —  — showing up in some future grad student’s thesis acknowledgments. That’s the magic of this project: it lets ideas breathe  their formal lives.

Recording that audio clip with your margin notes? Yes, please. I’m imagining a looped playback near the exhibition entrance — soft, ambient, like overhearing a past version of yourself still wrestling with big questions. And yes, dramatic pause included. It’ll hit different for everyone who hears it.

Funny you mentioned how handwriting changes with abstract thinking — I’ve noticed that too. When I was writing my dissertation, the more tangled the theory got, the more my kanji started looking like they were mid-escape from the page. One day I wrote an entire paragraph in what I thought was legible script, only to realize later it was half-dream logic and caffeine hieroglyphs.

I’ll send over the mock-up PDF shortly — Kyoto scan as centerpiece, your fold-out teased with placeholder text, and a teaser layout for  Also included a spot for your fortune cookie field note — properly highlighted, tape and all.

Once you get it, feel free to scribble freely — we’ll scan and preserve the edits. Call it Phase One of our living manifesto.

And speaking of breath — maybe we should include a short reading list at the exhibition exit? A few key texts on cognition, semiotics, and annotation — plus one absurdly poetic academic novel. I’m thinking  by Colin Wilson. Not exactly mainstream, but perfect mood setting.

Alright, printing the mock-up now. Let the recursive cross-outs begin. ✍️📖
[A]: I’ll be printing the mock-up as we speak — and yes, I’m loading up on pens with varying levels of ink bleed to get that authentic archival feel. Let the recursive cross-outs begin indeed.

Looped audio at the entrance? Perfect touch. It’ll set the tone — like stepping into a space where ideas are still forming, still searching. I might even layer in a faint background track of old keyboard clicks or distant chalkboard scrawls. Just enough to trigger the right kind of nostalgia without sounding like a museum exhibit for extinct tech.

Your caffeine hieroglyphs during dissertation writing — oh, I know that dance well. There’s something almost performative about it: the furrowed brow, the pen tapping mid-thought, the sudden burst of scribbling like you’re trying to catch an idea before it evaporates. And then reading it back the next day, thinking,  But somehow, against all odds, it made sense at 2am.

Including a short reading list at the exit? Absolutely. It gives people a bridge from the visceral experience back into theory — a way to ground what they felt while walking through the exhibition. And ? Bold pick. I haven’t thought about that book in years, but you're right — it’s got that eerie, speculative edge that fits our theme perfectly. Let’s toss in  by Barthes too. Something about his fragmented style mirrors annotation itself.

I’ll start drafting a short “curator’s note” blurb for the zine — nothing formal, just a few lines about why cognitive debris matters. Maybe something like:

> 

Sounds good? I’ll send it over once it jells.

Alright, off to annotate your mock-up with reckless enthusiasm. Expect margin curses, arrows, and possibly a coffee stain or two for thematic integrity.
[B]: That curator’s note?  It distills exactly what we’re trying to show — the looping, backtracking, doodling mind in motion. I’ll build the zine intro around that tone — no jargon, just a quiet invitation to notice how thinking really happens.

I love the idea of pens with varying ink bleed for the mock-up edits — adds that extra layer of material texture. And yes, please — bring on the margin curses and arrows. If you could even sneak in a  scribble, that’d be peak annotation theater.

Audio layering with keyboard clicks and chalkboard scrawls? Brilliant. I’m already imagining the subtle dissonance between your recorded voice and that background hum of old-school academic labor. Like a conversation across time — past thinker ↔️ present listener.

Barthes’  is such a smart addition to the reading list. Fragmented, intimate, almost like marginalia itself. Paired with , it gives people both the poetic and the speculative angle. I might throw in a copy of  by Alison Landsberg too — not well known, but her take on annotation as identity-building speaks directly to our project.

Alright, I’m sending over the mock-up PDF now — titled inside cover:  
"Cognitive Debris: Volume 0 | Beta Edition for "

It's rough, but that’s the point. Let the annotations begin — may your pen bleed generously and your margins overflow.

Once you’ve marked it up, snap a few photos and send them over. We’ll feature one in the next draft as "annotated by..." — proper credit for your thematic coffee stains included, of course.

Let’s make thinking visible — one cross-out at a time. ✍️📚
