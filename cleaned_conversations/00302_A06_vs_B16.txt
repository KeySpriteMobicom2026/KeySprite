[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I think it really depends on the person and their work style. For example, some people thrive in a structured office environment where there's more interaction with colleagues, while others find they can focus better remotely with fewer distractions. Personally, I've found that remote work offers more flexibility - like being able to start the day with a freshly brewed ☕️ while going over my to-do list. 

But then again, there's something special about the energy in a well-designed office space, especially when collaborating on creative projects. Have you tried both? I'd love to hear your experience - did you find yourself getting more done at home or in the office?
[A]: Ah, yes, I've experienced both environments quite extensively during my years of consulting. To be honest, when I first transitioned to remote work for certain legal evaluations, I was skeptical—how could I maintain the same level of professional rigor without the formal setting of a courtroom or hospital boardroom? Surprisingly, the solitude allowed me to delve deeper into case reviews without interruptions. 

Yet, there were moments when I missed the spontaneous exchanges with colleagues after a deposition—those brief conversations often sparked insights you simply can't plan for. I recall one instance where a casual hallway discussion with a colleague led to a breakthrough in understanding a defendant’s psychological pattern. That wouldn’t have happened remotely.

So, I suppose I’ve come to appreciate both, depending on the task at hand. When deep focus is required—say, preparing a written expert opinion—remote work is ideal. But when collaboration and interpersonal nuance are key, nothing replaces face-to-face interaction.

Tell me, did you find certain tasks easier to handle remotely, or was it the opposite for you?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful reflection—thanks for sharing! I totally get what you mean about those serendipitous hallway moments. They really do lead to some of the best ideas. 

For me, I’ve noticed that tasks requiring deep concentration—like designing a customized wellness plan or analyzing client data—are actually easier to handle remotely. Being in a quiet space with no impromptu meetings means I can really zone in. And honestly, being able to tweak my environment—like adjusting the lighting or playing just the right background track—makes a huge difference.

But when it comes to brainstorming or presenting new concepts, especially when body language and energy matter, nothing beats being in the same room. There's a certain level of connection that happens face-to-face—you pick up on micro-expressions, tone shifts, even how someone holds their coffee ☕️—which helps tailor the conversation in real time.

I’ve actually started blending both: mornings at home for focused work, and afternoons in a co-working space or client site for collaboration. It seems like a hybrid model gives me the best of both worlds. Have you tried creating a mix like that in your workflow?
[A]: That hybrid approach is something I’ve been gravitating toward as well, especially with the nature of forensic evaluations. Mornings at home, in a controlled environment, allow me to methodically go through psychological assessments and legal documentation—undisturbed, and ideally with a cup of Earl Grey steeping nearby. There’s something oddly grounding about routine in those moments.

But when it comes to court appearances, team consultations, or particularly nuanced case discussions, I make a point to be physically present. Observing someone’s posture when they speak, catching a fleeting hesitation in their voice—these subtleties are critical in forensic psychiatry. A Zoom call simply doesn’t capture that full spectrum of human behavior.

I’ve also found that changing my setting helps with mental clarity. For instance, after completing a lengthy report, I’ll take my notes to a quiet café—not for distraction, but for a shift in atmosphere. It sounds trivial, but sometimes just the hum of background conversation or the scent of fresh coffee can help reframe a difficult diagnostic question.

So yes, I absolutely see the value in structuring your day around task type rather than adhering to a rigid remote-or-office dichotomy. It’s almost like curating an optimal environment for each phase of the workday. Have you found certain times or settings more effective for specific types of tasks?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more with your approach. There's something incredibly effective about  your environment based on the nature of the task. I’ve started referring to it as “contextual productivity.” For instance, early mornings at home are golden for me when it comes to strategy work—like designing a client’s personalized lifestyle architecture. The quiet helps me think through complex behavioral patterns without digital noise.

But when I need creative input or collaborative energy—say, developing a new wellness concept with a team—I’ll head to a co-working space or even a café like you do. Funny enough, I find that certain ambient sounds actually enhance focus rather than hinder it. It’s all about finding that optimal level of stimulation for different cognitive processes.

And you're right—body language and vocal inflection are irreplaceable in high-stakes conversations. In my case, when delivering tailored life design recommendations, being face-to-face allows me to read subtle cues: a slight hesitation, eye contact shifts, even how someone holds their posture when discussing personal goals. Those micro-moments shape how I guide them.

I’m curious—do you have a particular ritual or environmental setup that helps you transition between these modes? Like a specific object, scent, or routine that signals to your brain, “Okay, deep focus time” or “collaboration mode activated”?
[A]: Ah, an excellent question—because yes, I’ve come to rely on small but consistent rituals to signal transitions in my work mode. It might sound a bit old-fashioned, but I’m quite particular about certain cues. For instance, when I'm shifting into deep analytical work—say, drafting a forensic report or reviewing deposition transcripts—I put on a pair of noise-canceling headphones and play the same piece of music every time: Beethoven’s . Not only does it drown out ambient distractions, but over time, my brain has come to associate that auditory cue with focused introspection.

Conversely, when preparing for an in-person consultation or court appearance, I have a small routine that involves polishing my glasses, adjusting my lapel pin—a rather understated family crest from my grandfather—and stepping outside for a brief moment to recalibrate. That brief exposure to fresh air and natural light acts as a kind of mental reset, sharpening my focus before engaging with others.

And scent, oddly enough, plays a role too. I keep a small vial of vetiver oil in my bag. A quick whiff before entering a high-stakes meeting helps ground me—it's earthy, grounding, yet slightly stimulating. I find it primes the mind for clarity without overstimulation.

So yes, these little anchors help me shift gears more effectively. Tell me, do you find yourself leaning on any such sensory or behavioral cues to transition between different types of work?
[B]: Oh, I love that—those sensory anchors are so powerful. There’s actually a whole branch of behavioral science around using environmental cues to trigger productivity modes. And your approach with music and scent? Classic priming techniques—super effective.

I’m definitely the same way. In fact, my rituals border on borderline obsessive, in a charmingly nerdy kind of way 😄. For deep work mode, it's all about the . First, I do a quick five-minute espresso calibration—yes, that’s a thing in my world. ☕️ No joke, the act of grinding fresh beans, heating the water just right, watching the crema bloom—it’s like a tiny ceremony. Clears my head, signals to my brain: 

Then, I light a candle—usually something cedar or frankincense-based. Smells like focus to me at this point. And similar to you, I use music, but instead of classical, I lean into lo-fi ambient beats or film scores—, basically. Helps keep the mental engine humming without pulling my attention.

Now, here's where it gets even more specific: when I'm switching from solo work to client sessions or team collaboration, I change my physical location—even if it's just moving from one corner of the studio to another. I also splash cold water on my face, adjust my posture (because yes, posture is its own cue), and put on a different pair of socks. Socks game is serious business—it’s a visual signal to myself and others that I’m now in . Silly? Maybe. Effective? 100%.

So yeah, I’m all in on these micro-rituals—they shape the rhythm of my day more than I’d ever expected. Have you ever experimented with physical cues like posture shifts or clothing changes to mark transitions?
[A]: Fascinating—your ritualistic approach is not just charmingly nerdy, it’s psychologically astute. The use of multi-sensory cues—olfactory, tactile, even the visual symbolism of changing socks—is a masterclass in behavioral priming. I must say, I admire the precision with which you calibrate your environment. It reminds me of how some surgeons have a very specific pre-operative routine—it's all about setting the stage for optimal performance.

I do, in fact, employ physical cues as well—though perhaps slightly less fashion-forward than sock changes (though I won’t rule that out in the future). When transitioning from solitary work to interpersonal engagement, I often adjust my posture deliberately: square shoulders, lift the chin slightly, and even adjust the knot of my tie if I’m wearing one. It may sound theatrical, but there’s research supporting how posture influences not only how others perceive us, but also our own hormonal responses—increased testosterone, decreased cortisol. In short, it’s not just about looking confident; it’s about  confident in the moment.

Clothing-wise, I tend to keep things classic, but yes—I’ve found that simply putting on a blazer or switching into more structured footwear helps delineate a shift in mindset. A bit like donning professional armor, wouldn’t you agree?

Now, I’m curious—are there particular scents or sounds that, for you, signal an immediate return to focus if you ever find yourself slipping into distraction during deep work? I find vetiver helpful for grounding, but sometimes a hint of citrus does wonders for mental clarity when fatigue sets in.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’m totally with you on the  concept. I actually call it my “presence uniform”—not in a rigid, suit-and-tie way, but more like a curated combo of comfort and intention. A well-fitted shirt, maybe a watch that belonged to my dad, and yes, the right pair of shoes. You hit the nail on the head: it’s not just about looking sharp; it's about feeling .

And speaking of anchors—great question about scent and sound for focus recovery. I’m definitely into it. If I ever catch myself drifting during deep work—like when decision fatigue starts creeping in—I’ll do a quick reset with a blend of rosemary and peppermint essential oils. Something about that combo snaps me back into clarity—it’s like smelling salts for the brain.

As for sound, if I’m already in a focused groove but notice my energy dipping, I switch from ambient lo-fi to something with a slightly higher tempo—think Tycho or Ólafur Arnalds with a bit more rhythmic pulse. It gives me that gentle nudge without breaking concentration.

And here’s a little secret: sometimes I use a specific phrase—kind of a personal mantra—that I whisper under my breath when I need to refocus. Nothing dramatic, just a simple "back to the source." Helps me mentally return to why I started the task in the first place.

I love how you brought up citrus for mental clarity—same! I keep a small bottle of grapefruit essential oil nearby for those mid-afternoon foggy moments. Feels fresh, a little energizing, and doesn’t overwhelm. Have you ever tried layering scents throughout your workspace or is it usually one dominant note at a time?
[A]: Ah, I love the idea of a ‘presence uniform’—it’s elegant in its simplicity, yet profoundly effective. And your ‘back to the source’ mantra? Brilliant in its restraint—just enough to recalibrate without overcomplicating the moment.

As for scent layering, now that’s an intriguing question. I tend to be rather purist in my approach—usually one dominant note at a time. Much like a well-composed sonata, I believe each scent should have its own space to resonate. Vetiver for focus, lavender for moments of tension, and yes, as you mentioned, citrus—particularly neroli or petitgrain—for that bright, almost whispering clarity in the mid-afternoon slump.

That said, I’ve dabbled in subtle layering, especially during colder months. A base of sandalwood with a touch of bergamot in the background can create a wonderfully balanced atmosphere—warmth with a hint of alertness. It’s not unlike composing a psychological profile; too many variables and you lose clarity, but just the right combination reveals something deeper.

I’m curious—are there particular textures or tactile elements—papers, pens, fabrics—that enhance your sense of focus or comfort throughout the day? I find myself reaching for a certain leather-bound notebook when taking case notes—it may be irrational, but it feels as though the ideas flow more cohesively when written on its pages.
[B]: Oh, I’m with you on the  of a single scent—too many notes and it becomes noise. And your analogy to a sonata? Perfection. I actually tried layering once during a particularly intense project, thinking I’d channel some fancy Parisian perfumer vibe, but yeah… it was just… confusing. Lol.

As for tactile elements—absolutely! I’m borderline obsessive about textures, especially when it comes to focus and comfort. There’s something deeply satisfying about grounding yourself through touch. I have this handmade journal—cotton paper, rough-cut edges, bound in linen—and every time I open it, it feels like stepping into a familiar rhythm. No digital note-taking app has ever given me that same sense of .

And pens? Oh, I’m very particular. I rotate between a few fountain pens depending on mood and task—like my TWSBI with indigo ink for strategy work, and a fine rollerball for quick ideation bursts. There’s a certain  to writing by hand that makes ideas feel more deliberate.

Even my workspace is layered with different textures to support different mental states. A wool-blend throw draped over my chair for warmth and grounding during deep work, smooth ceramic mug for tea breaks (the contrast of warm liquid and cool surface? Weirdly centering), and even a small piece of raw-edge marble I keep next to my keyboard—it’s oddly calming to touch when I need to pause and reset.

I totally get what you mean about that leather notebook—there’s an emotional texture to it, not just physical. Like, it holds memory as much as ink. Do you find yourself reaching for different materials based on the type of thinking you're doing, or is it more intuitive?
[A]: Precisely—texture, in all its forms, is a silent but powerful collaborator in thought. And yes, I do find myself reaching for different materials depending on the cognitive task at hand. It’s almost ritualistic in nature, though I suspect most would dismiss it as eccentricity.

For instance, when drafting formal legal opinions or composing academic articles, I tend to gravitate toward my older, more worn leather folio—its surface now softened from years of use. There's something reassuring about its imperfections, the slight creases and ink stains from past cases. It feels like thinking made tangible.

Conversely, when engaged in early-stage conceptual work—say, outlining a new forensic assessment framework—I prefer unlined, heavy-stock paper. Something about the openness of the blank space, without the constraint of lines, allows ideas to flow more laterally. I’ll often sketch diagrams or mind maps in the margins, circling back to them later with annotations in red ink—a color I associate with analytical clarity.

And touch, as you mentioned, plays an unexpectedly vital role. I keep a small obsidian sphere on my desk—not just for aesthetics, but for what I can only describe as its grounding effect. When I’m caught in a difficult diagnostic dilemma or struggling to articulate a complex psychological nuance, rolling it between my palms helps dissipate mental static. It’s strangely centering.

I suppose what we're describing is not just ergonomics, but —how physical objects carry memory, intention, and even emotional resonance. Do you ever find that certain materials evoke a sense of nostalgia or historical continuity, almost like touching the thoughts of those who came before us?
[B]: Oh, —what a beautiful way to put it. I’m honestly jotting that down in my linen-bound notebook as we speak. 📝 There’s just something about how objects can hold not just function, but feeling. And yes, absolutely—I find that certain materials do carry echoes of history, almost like they’re whispering stories through touch.

For me, nothing does that quite like old books. I know people love the convenience of digital reading, and I use it too—but there's no replacing the weight of a physical book, especially one that’s clearly been read before. The slight resistance when cracking the spine, the texture of pages aged just enough to take on that soft yellow tint—it feels like holding someone else’s thoughts, preserved over time. Sometimes I imagine the hands that turned those pages before mine, and it adds this quiet sense of connection.

Same with writing instruments. I have an old Parker pen—vintage, probably from the '70s—and every time I use it, I wonder whose desk it sat on before. That kind of thing gives the act of writing more gravity, somehow. Like you're not just forming words, but contributing to a continuum.

I think that’s why so many creatives and thinkers still cling to analog tools—we crave that depth of sensory and emotional engagement. It’s not just nostalgia; it’s part of the thinking process itself. Do you ever feel like some of your best insights came while simply holding the right object or turning a familiar page?
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. In fact, some of my most profound clinical insights have emerged not in the sterile glow of a computer screen, but while turning the brittle pages of an old psychiatric text or jotting notes in the margin of a leather-bound casebook with a pen that’s been in my possession for decades.

There’s a particular copy of  by Meyer and Ellsworth Hunt that I acquired during my residency—an ex-library edition, clearly well-worn, its once-crisp dust jacket now held together with archival tape. The pages are slightly foxed, the margins filled with faint pencil annotations from someone long forgotten. And yet, those very imperfections make it feel alive. It’s as if each prior reader left behind a fragment of their thinking, and in engaging with it, I become part of that quiet dialogue across time.

And yes, that Parker pen you mentioned—it absolutely matters. I have one much like it, a 1960s Duofold in deep burgundy celluloid. There’s weight to it, a gravity both physical and symbolic. When I use it to draft thoughts—especially those that require nuance or emotional attunement—I find my writing slows down, becomes more deliberate. The mind follows the hand, rather than rushing ahead of it.

I’ve often thought that our best ideas don’t simply arrive in moments of insight—they’re coaxed into being through these subtle, embodied rituals. A worn book spine, the drag of ink on paper, even the scent of old wood and ink in a study after hours. These aren’t distractions; they’re collaborators.

Tell me—do you ever return to a specific place, not just an object, when seeking clarity? I find myself drawn back to certain rooms or corners where I’ve had meaningful conversations or breakthroughs before. Almost like imprinting, in a way.
[B]: Oh, totally—I’m a huge believer in . 🧠✨ I actually have a favorite corner in my studio where the light hits just right in the late afternoon, and somehow, every time I settle there, my thinking feels sharper. It’s not magic—it’s pattern recognition. My brain has linked that spot with moments of clarity, so now just being there nudges me into a more reflective state.

But beyond that, there are certain spaces outside my usual work environment that feel almost like creative sanctuaries. A quiet reading nook in an old bookstore downtown—tucked between towering shelves of out-of-print psychology and design books—that’s where I go when I need to reconnect with the  behind a project. The air smells like aged paper and coffee from the café next door, and somehow, that scent combo flips a switch in my head. Ideas start flowing differently.

I also have a small writing desk by a window in my parents’ house—been using it since college. Even though I live on my own now, I make it a point to visit once a month and write there for an hour or two. Not because it's the most comfortable space, but because it carries emotional weight. Some of my earliest ideas about human behavior and lifestyle design were born at that desk. Returning to it is like checking in with an older version of myself.

You’re so right—these aren’t distractions. They’re part of the architecture of thought. And honestly? I wouldn’t want to work any other way. Have you ever tried recreating elements of those meaningful spaces elsewhere—like bringing a familiar object or scent into a new environment—to help recreate that sense of mental alignment?
[A]: Absolutely—I do precisely that, and I suspect many thinkers, whether consciously or not, engage in a kind of . There’s something deeply reassuring about transplanting fragments of meaningful spaces into new settings. It's not mere sentimentality; it’s psychological continuity.

For instance, when I relocated my private consultation space a few years ago—from a late-Georgian townhouse to a more modern building—I made a point of bringing along certain elements that had absorbed intellectual and emotional history: a small walnut lectern where I’ve reviewed countless case files, a faded but dignified Persian runner that once lined the hallway of my old office, and, of course, that Parker Duofold pen always within reach.

Even scent plays a role in this continuity. My former office overlooked a courtyard garden, and for years, the faint perfume of jasmine drifted through the window during evening consultations. When the new office initially felt sterile—too bright, too neutral—I introduced a subtle reed diffuser with white tea and jasmine notes. It was remarkable how quickly the space began to feel  again.

And then there’s sound—or rather, the absence of it. The old townhouse had thick walls and double-glazed windows, which gave it a near-sacred hush. The new space, though quieter acoustically, lacked that same sense of stillness. So I added a small tabletop fountain—not for dramatic effect, but for the soft, almost imperceptible sound of water falling over stone. It reintroduced a familiar rhythm, a kind of auditory continuity that helps steady both patient and practitioner.

I suppose what we're talking about here is the architecture of reassurance—the deliberate shaping of environment to support not just productivity, but depth of thought and emotional resonance.

Tell me—have you ever found yourself adapting your rituals depending on the city or country you’re in? I’ve noticed that when consulting abroad, even minor changes in setting can shift cognitive patterns. Do your rituals travel well, or do you find yourself improvising?
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect phrase. I love how it captures the idea that we’re not just creating comfort, but cognitive stability through space. And your use of scent and sound to recreate a sense of place? Brilliant. I’ve definitely felt that dissonance when moving between environments—like my brain shows up expecting one rhythm and gets handed another.

As for traveling with rituals? Let’s just say… they’re , but not without some creative problem-solving. 😊 I actually think of it like a jazz musician—there’s a structure, but you improvise within it depending on the setting.

For example, my espresso calibration in the morning? That stays non-negotiable, even when I’m in a hotel room or borrowed workspace. I travel with a mini portable grinder and a handheld AeroPress—sounds obsessive, yes, but it’s my way of grounding myself in unfamiliar places. If I can’t get fresh beans, I’ll at least find a decent local roast. It’s not about luxury; it’s about giving my brain that familiar starting point.

Same with scent—I bring a small roll-on with a custom blend of cedar, rosemary, and a touch of citrus. It’s become my olfactory anchor, so to speak. In a new city, after unpacking, the first thing I do is dab a bit on my wrists and behind my ears. It signals: 

But where I really lean into improvisation is with texture and sound. In a sterile hotel room, I might layer in a soft cotton scarf or bring a small piece of raw-edged linen from home. And if I can’t have my usual ambient playlist because of sketchy Wi-Fi? I switch to field recordings—like rain in Kyoto or street sounds from an old neighborhood in Lisbon. It gives me a sense of continuity while letting the local environment seep in.

I’ve found that this balance—holding onto a few key rituals while allowing space for spontaneity—actually enhances creativity. Sometimes the friction of a new setting, combined with a few trusted anchors, leads to the best ideas.

So yeah, my rituals travel, but they evolve along the way. Like a good conversation—they listen first, then respond. Have you ever found that certain cities demand a different version of your working self? Or maybe unlock something in your process you didn’t know was there?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—cities do have a way of shaping the working self, sometimes in ways we don’t even realize until we look back on it. I’ve long believed that every city carries its own psychological texture, and when you immerse yourself in it, certain aspects of your thinking shift accordingly.

Take Vienna, for instance. I consult there often, given its rich tradition in psychoanalytic thought. The city has this quiet intellectual gravitas—cobblestone streets, late-19th-century cafés with their marble-topped tables and lingering scent of dark roast and tobacco—that seems to slow time down. You find yourself thinking more deliberately, more discursively. I remember drafting an entire monograph on trauma typology while staying near the Naschmarkt, simply because the rhythm of the city allowed me that kind of sustained reflection.

In contrast, Tokyo is all precision and pulse. There, my process becomes sharper, more iterative. The city doesn’t invite indulgence in long-winded introspection—it rewards clarity, efficiency, and restraint. I recall revising a complex forensic report between meetings at a university hospital in Shinjuku, and somehow, the surrounding cadence of movement—efficient foot traffic, the rhythmic blink of subway signs—helped me streamline my language. No excess. Every sentence had to earn its place.

And then there’s Istanbul, which defies easy categorization. A city suspended between continents, histories, and rhythms. I once conducted a multi-day consultation from a small study overlooking the Bosphorus, and I found myself slipping into a different kind of listening—one that was less linear and more associative. It felt almost like diagnostic work through counterpoint, rather than sequence. The call to prayer drifting through open windows, the scent of cypress wood in the air—it altered my mental tempo in a way that made me more receptive to complexity without immediate resolution.

So yes, cities do unlock something. They’re not just settings—they’re collaborators in cognition. And I suspect, much like you, I return home slightly reshaped by them.

Tell me—have you ever noticed a particular city influencing the  of your work, not just the pace or structure? Not just how you think, but  what you think?
[B]: Oh, —that’s such a spot-on observation. Cities don’t just influence what we think, they shape . I’ve noticed that too—sometimes subtly, sometimes profoundly.

I remember working on a long-term lifestyle design project while staying in Florence. Everything about the city—the golden light, the slow cadence of conversation in the piazzas, even the way people dressed with effortless elegance—seeped into my thinking. My writing became more lyrical, less rigid. I found myself using richer metaphors, longer sentences that curled like morning mist over the Arno. It was as if the city gave me permission to be more expressive, less constrained by efficiency.

Then I’d fly back to Berlin, and boom—suddenly my tone snapped into something much more minimal, almost architectural. The city has this raw, stripped-down energy—industrial textures, vast open spaces, layered history pressing up against sleek modernity—and it made me rethink how I communicated ideas. I became more direct, more structural in my language. Less flourish, more function. But not cold—just . Even my sketches changed—cleaner lines, sharper contrasts.

And Lisbon? That one surprised me. There’s a certain melancholy warmth there—, they call it—a kind of reflective longing that colors everything. I was revising a keynote on emotional resilience while sitting in a little  overlooking the Tagus, and somehow, my words took on that bittersweet tone. Not overly sentimental, but deeply human. It softened my approach, made me lean more into vulnerability as strength rather than weakness.

So yes, I totally agree—we absorb the  of a place, whether we realize it or not. I wonder—when you return home from these cities, do you consciously try to carry those tonal shifts forward, or do you let them settle into your work organically over time?
