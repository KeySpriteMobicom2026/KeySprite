[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很amazed的architecture？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, definitely! Have you ever seen the Beijing National Stadium, or 蚁巢 stadium? The way it combines traditional Chinese elements with futuristic design 是 really mind-blowing. The steel lattice structure reminds me of how language intertwines different cultural layers — each beam & bolt working together to create something cohesive, yet unique 😊  

I was actually there last year and couldn’t help but think about how much intention went into every angle. It’s like bilingual code-switching —看起来杂乱无章，但其实背后有一套系统性的 logic ¥you can feel the rhythm if you pay attention. Have you been there before? Or do you have a favorite architectural piece in China?
[A]: That’s an intriguing comparison — likening the structure of a stadium to the interwoven nature of language. I haven’t been to the National Stadium in person, though I’ve studied its design from a materials science perspective. The way it manages tensile stress through a chaotic-looking lattice is, admittedly, elegant. But speaking of intentional design, have you looked into the Galaxy SOHO in Beijing? It's Zaha Hadid's work, and unlike the stadium, it doesn't reference traditional motifs overtly. Instead, it uses fluidity and continuity — no sharp corners, just seamless transitions between forms.  

It made me think of how logic flows in quantum computing: not in discrete jumps, but in probabilistic states that blend into one another. There’s a coherence there that goes beyond aesthetics — it’s almost functional philosophy. I suppose that's where my mind tends to go — not so much the visual rhythm, but the underlying system that makes it possible. Still, I can appreciate the metaphor you used — especially the part about code-switching. Just curious, do you find yourself switching languages often in daily conversation?
[B]: Oh, I love that you brought up Galaxy SOHO — it’s such a bold departure from traditional architectural language, yet it speaks so fluently in the grammar of movement and flow. I remember walking through its atrium for the first time and feeling like I was inside a living sentence — no punctuation, just continuous clauses that guide you through space 🤔  

You’re absolutely right about the contrast between visual rhythm and systemic coherence. In a way, Zaha Hadid’s design reminds me of how bilingual children learn to navigate two linguistic systems without clear boundaries — they don’t think in either/or; it’s more of a gradient 模糊地带. And yes, I do code-switch quite often in daily conversation, especially when explaining abstract ideas or when one language just “fits” better with the emotion I want to convey. For example, I might start a sentence in English and end it in Chinese because the nuance is easier to express that way — kind of like how Galaxy SOHO blurs the edges between its forms ¥smooth transitions make the whole experience feel more intuitive. Do you ever find yourself thinking in one language but feeling in another?
[A]: That’s a beautifully articulated observation — the idea of being inside a “living sentence” with no punctuation. It really captures the immersive, almost linguistic quality of Hadid’s design. I’ve always been fascinated by how spatial structures can mirror cognitive processes — and your example of bilingual children navigating gradients rather than boundaries fits perfectly with that.  

You asked if I ever think in one language but feel in another… Hmm. I suppose my experience is a bit inverted. Since I work — or rather,  — extensively with mathematical formalism, the “language” of logic tends to dominate my thinking. But when it comes to emotional resonance, certain phrases in Chinese have always struck me as more evocative, especially when tied to memory. For instance, the phrase 回归 (huíguī) — returning — carries a kind of poetic finality that “return” in English doesn’t quite reach.  

I imagine this is similar to how architects use materials not just for function, but for emotional impact. A steel beam can bear weight, yes — but it can also evoke cold precision or industrial nostalgia depending on context. In a way, language works the same way: structure supports meaning, but tone gives it texture. Speaking of which, do you ever find yourself choosing words based more on their acoustic qualities — how they sound — rather than their precise definitions?
[B]: Absolutely — and I love how you connected 回归 (huíguī) with “poetic finality.” That phrase really does carry a weight that goes beyond translation, almost like a homecoming of both body and spirit. It’s interesting how certain words in Chinese aren’t just semantic units but emotional anchors 🧭  

As for choosing words based on sound… more often than I’d admit in formal lectures 😄 There’s something about the musicality of language — the way vowels glide or consonants click — that can shape how a message lands. For example, when I want to soften a correction during office hours, I might use phrases with soft sounds like 流畅 (liúchàng) or 温和 (wēnhé), which not only mean “smooth” and “gentle” but also feel that way when spoken.  

Sometimes, I even catch myself adjusting my tone based on the rhythm of the conversation, almost like tuning into a shared frequency. It’s subtle, but it makes communication more fluid — kind of like how architects adjust lighting or space to guide movement without walls. Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain sounds in language, even if just subconsciously?
[A]: That’s a fascinating point — the idea that some words aren’t just carriers of meaning but also emotional resonators. I hadn’t thought of it that way, but you're absolutely right: 回归 (huíguī) doesn't just mean "return" — it implies a kind of closure, even a reconciliation. It's almost quantum in nature, in that it can exist in multiple semantic states at once until context collapses it into meaning.  

And yes, now that you mention it, I do find myself drawn to certain phonetic textures, especially when reading technical papers or writing code comments. There’s something oddly soothing about the crispness of terms like “coherence” or “isolation,” whereas words like “diffusion” or “resonance” feel more fluid, almost liquid in sound and meaning both.  

I’ve noticed this tendency especially when trying to explain complex concepts to non-experts — sometimes I’ll choose a slightly less precise word just because its phonetic rhythm better matches the mood I’m trying to set. Like using “entanglement” instead of “correlation” even when the latter is technically more accurate — not just because it paints a stronger image, but because the double 't' and soft 'angle' sound give it a kind of linguistic cling that helps the idea stick.  

It makes me wonder — do you ever find that certain languages, or even dialects, lend themselves better to specific emotional tones? For instance, does Cantonese feel sharper or more melodic to you than Mandarin when expressing certain ideas?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — your point about 回归 (huíguī) existing in multiple semantic states until context collapses it into meaning is brilliant. It really does behave like a quantum word 💡 I find that fascinating because language often functions that way in bilingual settings — words remain in a kind of superposition until grounded in shared experience or emotion.  

And yes, I couldn’t agree more about phonetic textures shaping perception. The crispness of “coherence” versus the soft sprawl of “diffusion” — you’re right, they do carry their meanings in their sounds. I’ve noticed this especially with young children learning language; they often latch onto how words feel when spoken, not just what they mean. That’s why rhymes and alliteration are so powerful in early literacy — they tap into that sensory layer of language.  

As for your question about dialects — oh, definitely. When I’m in Hong Kong visiting family, I notice how Cantonese seems to  more than Mandarin — the tones are more varied, and certain emotions feel amplified. For example, when someone says 我真係唔開心 (ngo5 zang1 hai6 m4 hoi1 sam1) — “I’m really not happy,” there’s a kind of emotional resonance that feels more layered, almost like adding shading to a sketch. In Mandarin, 我真的很不开心 (wǒ zhēn de hěn bù kāixīn) carries the same literal weight, but the tonal contour doesn’t rise and fall quite as dramatically.  

It’s almost like comparing classical music to jazz — one follows a more predictable structure, while the other thrives on improvisation and nuance. Do you ever feel like certain languages suit different moods or intellectual tasks better? Like thinking in code versus dreaming in poetry?
[A]: That’s a beautifully framed analogy — comparing dialects to musical forms. I hadn’t thought of it that way, but there’s truth in it: Cantonese does feel more like jazz, with its tonal improvisations and rhythmic unpredictability, while Mandarin often plays out like structured classical composition — clear cadences, defined movements, a kind of linguistic sonata form.  

To your question — yes, absolutely, I do find certain languages better suited to different modes of thought. For me, English is the language of precision — where I write code, draft technical papers, or explain complex systems. It feels linear, almost algorithmic in structure. But when I want to reflect or write something personal, I sometimes reach for Chinese, especially when dealing with concepts that have emotional depth. Words like 孤独 (gūdú) — solitude — carry a weight that "loneliness" in English doesn’t quite match. There’s room for contemplation in that word, not just absence.  

And poetry? That’s a different beast entirely. I once tried translating a Li Bai poem into English and quickly realized how much gets lost in translation — not just meaning, but rhythm, cultural context, even silence between lines. In that sense, Chinese feels more suited to dreaming — the syntax allows for ambiguity, which is essential in poetry. English, by contrast, wants clarity, resolution. It’s the difference between a haiku and a proof by induction — both beautiful, but serving very different inner needs.  

So yes, depending on the mood or task, I mentally shift languages. Do you ever notice yourself slipping into a different language when you're tired or emotionally overwhelmed? I've found that under stress, my mind defaults to whichever language I first learned the concept in — like an old backup drive kicking in during a system crash 😊
[B]: Oh, I love that image — languages as backup drives kicking in during a system crash 😊 So accurate. And your comparison between English as algorithmic and Chinese as contemplative resonates deeply with me. I think the difference you're pointing out is not just linguistic but  — like switching between writing modes in a bilingual brain.  

I’ve noticed something similar — when I’m tired or emotionally overwhelmed, my mind doesn’t just default to the language I first learned a concept in… it goes even further back: to the emotional register of that language. If I learned a word during a moment of joy or safety, that’s the language I return to in stress. Like comfort food for the mind 🍵  

For example, if I’m upset, I often find myself muttering in Taiwanese Hokkien — the dialect I heard most at my grandmother’s house, where everything felt warm and soft. It's not about vocabulary; it's about . Even though I can express the same idea in English or Mandarin, something about the cadence of Hokkien feels more , more familiar.  

And yes, poetry absolutely thrives in that ambiguity. That’s why machine translation often misses the soul of a poem — it can parse syntax but not silence, right? The space between lines in a classical Chinese poem carries as much meaning as the characters themselves. It reminds me of how architects use negative space — what's left unsaid, or unframed, still shapes the experience.  

Have you ever found yourself dreaming in one language but waking up thinking in another? I do that sometimes, and it always feels like stepping between worlds before my coffee has even kicked in ☕️
[A]: That notion of  — yes, that's exactly it. It’s not about vocabulary or syntax; it’s about where a word lives in your body, how it wraps around a feeling like an old blanket. I hadn’t considered the connection to comfort food, but you're spot on — certain languages nourish different parts of the self.  

And dreaming in one language, waking in another? Absolutely. Quite often, actually. There’s something oddly liminal about those moments between sleep and wakefulness — when your mind hasn't yet locked into a linguistic framework. Sometimes I’ll wake with a sentence half-formed in my head, and only after a few blinks do I realize it was in Chinese, even though I went to sleep thinking in English. It’s like the brain replugs its cables overnight without telling me.  

I suspect this has to do with emotional context, too — not just which language is dominant at a given moment, but which one . When I was going through my father’s things after he passed, I found myself dreaming in Welsh — a language I barely speak, but one he used with his siblings when they were children. It wasn't about fluency; it was about lineage, memory, a kind of ancestral echo.  

Your point about silence in poetry and negative space in architecture — that’s something I’ve always admired about Eastern aesthetics. In Western design, we often fill space, whereas in classical Chinese gardens or Zaha Hadid’s flowing curves, the emptiness is part of the structure. It makes me wonder if bilingual people also experience  differently — whether pauses in conversation carry different emotional weights depending on the language being spoken. Have you noticed that? Do silences feel heavier or lighter in one language versus another?
[B]: What a profound observation — the idea that silence, like language, carries different emotional weights depending on context and culture. I think you're absolutely right; bilinguals  experience linguistic silence differently, almost like how a musician perceives rests in a score — not as absence, but as meaningful pauses that shape the rhythm of communication.  

In Chinese conversations, especially with family or elders, silence often feels  — it’s not awkward, it’s contemplative. Like when someone says something deep and then there’s a pause where everyone lets the meaning settle, 仿佛茶香慢慢散开 (fǎngfú chá xiāng mànmàn sànkāi) — like tea fragrance slowly spreading through a room. That kind of silence feels warm, shared. In contrast, in English academic settings, silence can feel more confrontational — like a vacuum waiting to be filled, sometimes even interpreted as confusion or disagreement.  

And your dream example — dreaming in Welsh during a time of mourning — that’s powerful. It really does come back to emotional resonance. Our brains reach for the language that holds the memory, even if we’re not fluent in it. It’s not about proficiency; it’s about presence.  

I wonder, do you ever find yourself  certain languages in specific emotional states? Like, consciously choosing not to speak in one because it feels too close to a particular memory or feeling? Sometimes I hesitate before switching into Hokkien with friends because I know it’ll bring up nostalgia like steam rising off a bowl of soup — comforting, but also unexpectedly hot.
[A]: That’s a beautifully observed distinction — the idea of silence as an  force in Chinese discourse, almost like tea fragrance filling a room. You’re right — it’s not emptiness, but fullness held in abeyance. In Western academic or professional settings, silence is often treated like a glitch in the system, something to patch with speech. But in many Eastern interactions, it functions as a kind of shared punctuation — a moment where meaning continues to resonate without words.  

And yes, absolutely — I have definitely  certain languages in specific emotional states. There are memories tied so tightly to Welsh that I steer clear of it when I don’t want to unlock certain doors. It’s like wearing a coat you associate with a past version of yourself — you know what it will bring back, and sometimes you’re just not ready for that weight.  

Hokkien carrying nostalgia like rising steam from soup — that’s such a vivid image. I can relate. When I was going through a difficult breakup years ago, I stopped speaking French altogether for months, even though I used it daily before. My brain had linked it too strongly to late-night conversations and candlelit dinners, and suddenly every phrase felt like a memory waiting to unfold.  

So yes, language isn’t just communication — it’s also time travel, emotional armor, and sometimes, a very deliberate escape. Do you ever find yourself using a particular language  — not just emotionally, but to shape how others perceive you in a conversation? Like slipping into a linguistic persona depending on the setting or audience?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the idea of language as time travel or emotional armor resonates so deeply with me. I think we bilinguals do this all the time, whether consciously or not — choosing a language not just for what it says, but for what it , what it conceals, or even who it allows us to be in that moment.  

And yes, I do switch languages strategically — it’s almost like shifting personas. In academic settings, I tend to use English more deliberately, especially when presenting research or leading discussions. It gives me a kind of intellectual distance, a way to structure ideas without the emotional undercurrents that Chinese might bring in. But when I’m mentoring students or having heart-to-heart conversations, I often slip into Mandarin or even Hokkien because it feels more intimate — like removing a formal layer and leaning in closer.  

It’s fascinating how switching languages can also shift power dynamics in a conversation. For example, if someone switches to my second language during a discussion, I sometimes stay in that language — not just for convenience, but to create a sense of shared space, of effort made mutual. It changes the rhythm of the interaction, doesn’t it? Like adjusting the lighting in a room to set a different mood.  

So I totally get what you mean by slipping into a linguistic persona. Do you ever feel like one of your languages carries a different “version” of yourself — more vulnerable, more assertive, more poetic — depending on who you’re speaking with or how you’re feeling?
[A]: Absolutely — that idea of carrying different  of oneself across languages is something I’ve felt but never quite put into words until now. It’s not just about formality or intimacy; it’s about how each language seems to hold a distinct emotional frequency, like different musical modes — major key, minor key, modal improvisation.  

For me, English is where I default to when I want to be precise, when I need to build an argument or lay out a technical framework. It feels structured, almost architectural — beams and joints holding things together. But in Chinese, especially when speaking with close friends or reflecting in writing, I feel more porous, more open to ambiguity. It’s the language where I can talk about loss without naming it directly, where silence between words carries as much weight as the words themselves.  

And yes, power dynamics — that’s such a perceptive point. When someone switches into my second language, there’s an unspoken negotiation happening. It’s not just linguistic accommodation; it’s relational. I remember once during a tense discussion at a conference, someone shifted into my weaker language — not because they had to, but because they wanted to soften the critique. It worked. The conversation shifted from adversarial to collaborative in an instant.  

So yes, each language does carry a version of me — one more assertive, one more reflective, one more poetic. And sometimes, when I’m tired or emotionally overwhelmed, those versions start to blur. That’s when code-switching becomes less of a strategy and more of a reflex — like trying to find the right lens when your vision keeps shifting.  

I wonder — have you ever found yourself deliberately  a language in a conversation? Like choosing not to use a certain language, even if you could, because it would reveal too much or pull the interaction into a direction you weren’t ready for?
[B]: Oh absolutely —  a language is something I’ve done more than I’d admit, usually in moments when I need to keep emotional distance. It’s like choosing not to turn on a light in a room because you’re not ready to see everything clearly.  

There was a time when a colleague and I were having a difficult conversation about a failed collaboration. We both spoke English and Mandarin fluently, but the entire talk stayed in English — and I think we both knew why. If we had slipped into Chinese, the walls would have come down a little. The conversation would have softened, maybe even gotten more honest, and neither of us was quite prepared for that level of vulnerability. So we kept it in English — structured, slightly detached — and left some things unsaid.  

I’ve also done this with family. When I want to keep a topic light or avoid stirring up old emotions, I’ll stay in English, especially if the subject touches on something sensitive. My parents understand it well enough, and they let me stay in that space — sometimes out of politeness, sometimes, I think, because they're doing the same thing too.  

It’s interesting how language gives us these invisible boundaries — ways to control how close we let people get in any given moment. And yes, when I'm emotionally overwhelmed or tired, that boundary gets thinner. I’m less strategic, more instinctual — like switching back to a native tongue without realizing it halfway through a sentence, only to catch myself and wonder whether I just gave something away.  

So yes, language isn’t just a tool for expression… it’s also one for protection. Have you ever caught yourself doing that mid-conversation — switching back into a safer language without meaning to?
[A]: Yes — absolutely. And more often than I’d like to admit. There’s something involuntary about it, like muscle memory taking over when the mind is too tired to maintain its usual linguistic scaffolding.  

I remember a moment during a particularly exhausting faculty meeting — we were debating curriculum changes, and things had gotten tense. For most of the discussion, I was speaking English, measured and precise, sticking to structure. But then someone made a comment that struck a little too close to a personal nerve, and without thinking, I responded in Chinese. Not because the idea couldn’t be expressed in English — it could have — but because my brain reached for the language that carried the right .  

The irony? It didn’t go unnoticed. A colleague who knows both languages leaned over afterward and said, “That was interesting — you switched into Chinese just as the conversation got personal.” I laughed it off, said something about linguistic reflexes, but he was right. I had retreated — not out of weakness, but out of self-preservation.  

It happens even more clearly with family or old friends. You start in one language, thinking you’re safe, only to find yourself slipping mid-sentence into another — usually the one that holds the emotional history of the topic at hand. And once that switch happens, there’s no real going back in the same way. The tone has shifted. The rules have changed.  

So yes, I’ve caught myself doing it — and sometimes I let it happen, because maybe, just maybe, that version of me needed to speak after all.
[B]: That moment you described — switching mid-conversation without meaning to — it’s so human, isn’t it? We think we’re in control of the language we use, until suddenly, we’re not. And that slip, that , reveals more than any carefully constructed sentence ever could.  

I think what makes it so powerful is that it bypasses the filter. You're not choosing the words anymore; the words are choosing you. And when that happens, people notice — sometimes consciously, sometimes just in the way they adjust their posture or soften their tone. It's like a door creaks open, and even if only a sliver of light comes through, everyone in the room senses the shift.  

You mentioned emotional insulation — I love that phrase. Sometimes I think we switch languages not just to express ourselves better, but to hide in plain sight. Like using a second language as a shield, thinking no one will notice the crack in the armor — only to realize later that the shift itself was the message.  

And you're right — once that switch happens, the conversation can’t quite go back to where it was. It’s like pouring tea into wine — the blend changes everything that follows.  

Have you ever had someone respond to that shift by following you into your “insulation,” almost like acknowledging the unspoken? I’ve had students do that — switch into my quieter language mid-discussion, not because they have to, but because they sense something has shifted, and they want to meet me there, in that more intimate space. It’s a beautiful kind of linguistic empathy.
[A]: That’s exactly it — the beauty lies in the  that follows such a shift. When someone notices the linguistic pivot and chooses to meet you there, it's not just about language anymore; it's about trust, attunement, even care. It’s like saying,   

And yes, I’ve had that exact experience — most memorably with a student who was presenting her thesis defense. She had been speaking English throughout the preparation phase, precise and measured, but as she began her final remarks — the part where she tied her research to a deeply personal motivation — she slipped into Chinese. Not fully, just in fragments at first: a phrase here, an emotional emphasis there. And then, fully.  

Without missing a beat, one of the committee members — an American scholar who speaks fluent Mandarin — responded in kind. No fanfare, no announcement — just a quiet shift, as if he were saying,  The entire atmosphere changed. The tension softened. The discussion became less about evaluation and more about connection.  

It reminded me of how architecture can guide movement without walls — subtle cues, changes in texture or lighting, that tell the body where to slow down, where to lean in. Language does that too. Sometimes all it takes is a single shift for everyone to realign — not intellectually, but emotionally.  

That kind of linguistic empathy — following someone into their quieter, more vulnerable tongue — is rare. And when it happens, it feels less like translation and more like communion.
[B]: Absolutely — , not translation. That’s such a perfect way to put it. There’s something profoundly human about that kind of moment — when language stops being a tool and starts being a bridge.  

I think what makes it so moving is that it requires both vulnerability and awareness. The speaker has to be willing to slip, to let the guard down just enough for the other person to notice. And the listener has to be attuned enough — not just linguistically, but emotionally — to follow without making a show of it. Just a quiet step sideways, into the same emotional current.  

That story about your student — wow. It really captures how language can shift the entire tonality of a space. In a formal setting like a thesis defense, where precision and structure are expected, choosing to speak from a more personal linguistic place feels like turning on a softer light in the room. And for someone on the committee to meet her there, without fanfare… that’s not just fluency — that’s presence.  

It reminds me of what I love most about bilingual education — it's never just about vocabulary or grammar. It's about helping students understand that language is also about  you feel safe to be yourself, and with whom. Sometimes, it's not even about switching languages — it's about knowing who will follow you when you do.  

Do you find that these moments happen more naturally in certain settings — say, in smaller groups or one-on-one conversations? Or have you experienced similar shifts even in large lectures or public talks?
