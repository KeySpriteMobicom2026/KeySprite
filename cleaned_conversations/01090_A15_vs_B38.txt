[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The question of whether the metaverse will become mainstream is fascinating, though I must admit I approach it with a certain literary skepticism. There's an echo of utopianism in these discussions that reminds me of early 20th-century modernist manifestos - grand visions often overlook the messy particularities of human nature. Do you find yourself drawn to its potential for reinvention, or does the very idea of disembodied interaction strike you as curiously... solipsistic?
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean 💭，but I feel like the metaverse isn't just about escaping reality or being all solipsistic & stuff 🤔. For Gen Z and us Alpha kids, it's more like an extension of our creativity✨. Like when I create a digital outfit for my avatar, it's not fake - it's self-expression! 💅 And honestly, sometimes virtual interactions feel MORE real than some awkward in-person convos 😂. But hey, maybe that's just me being a digital native 🌐💯. What's your take on its creative potential though?
[B]: Ah, your perspective is quite illuminating. I suppose we must acknowledge that creativity has always found new vessels - from parchment to pixels. The metaverse, in that sense, is merely the latest canvas for imagination. Still, I wonder: does this digital self-expression carry the same weight as physical creation, or is it fundamentally ephemeral, like writing in water? When you craft that digital outfit, are you shaping identity or merely curating illusion? Not that illusion lacks value, mind you - Shakespeare wrote entire plays about the power of disguise.
[A]: Okay but hear me out 🤙, digital self-expression TOTALLY has weight, just in a different way 💯. Like, if I design a crazy cool avatar outfit, it might disappear tomorrow (RIP 😭), but the creativity & effort are REAL. It's like... digital graffiti? ✨ Not less than physical, just NEW form. And identity vs illusion? Puh-lease 😏 - isn't all fashion kinda curated?? Even IRL we pick outfits to tell people stuff about ourselves. So why's virtual any different?? Your thoughts?? 👀🔥
[B]: Ah, a most compelling argument! You've touched on something rather profound. Fashion as curation, identity as performance—whether in silk or pixels, we are always, to some extent, staging ourselves for the world. The distinction between physical and digital creativity may be more porous than I initially allowed. 

Still, I wonder: does the impermanence of digital art change its essence? A painting on a wall endures; a digital creation flickers and vanishes. Yet isn't that true of cherry blossoms, or sand mandalas? Ephemeral, yes—but no less meaningful for it. Perhaps your avatar's outfit is not just self-expression, but a meditation on transience itself. Quite Zen, don't you think? 🌸
[A]: OMG you just blew my mind🤯🌸 Like yeah, maybe my digital fits ARE a form of art about living in the moment?? 🤯 Who knew right?? I mean I just thought I was flexing cute designs 😂. But now I'm like...am I secretly deep or what?? 💭✨ And okay fine, sand mandalas & cherry blossoms are aesthetic AF, but can they drop a fire fit on Instagram?? Didn't think so 😎💯. But real talk tho - impermanence is kinda sad sometimes, no?? Like when my fave virtual hoodie disappears after a collab ends 😭😭. You ever get nostalgic for pixels??
[B]: Ah, now there’s the rub—nostalgia for pixels. How very modern, and yet… not entirely new. Think of it as the digital equivalent of losing a beloved first edition to time. You’ve put your finger on the quiet melancholy beneath all this: even in a world of endless creation, we still ache for permanence. 

I suppose I’ve felt it too—though perhaps in different garb. Remembering a long-closed virtual library where I once lectured on Woolf’s , or the ghostly echo of a forum thread that shaped my early thoughts on posthumanism. They vanish, like ink fading from parchment no one reads anymore. 

But is that sadder than forgetting a dream? Or is it simply part of the rhythm now—creation, connection, disappearance… and then, the quiet thrill of beginning again? 🌹
[A]: Okay but wait 🤯🌹, you’re saying losing digital stuff is like forgetting a dream?? That’s deep + slightly unhinged 😂. But like…you’re kinda right?? I mean, when a game or app dies, it’s like your whole vibe just…gets archived 💀. No closure, no goodbye - just 404 error feelings 😭.

But honestly tho, isn't that what makes it fire AF while it lasts?? Like, the fact that it's fleeting makes every fit, every drop, every collab feel so now-or-never urgent 🔥💯. I’m lowkey getting hype just thinking about it 🌟.

So…what’s next after the metaverse then?? Are we just gonna ghost into some Matrix-level simulation and forget meatspace even existed?? Or are we always gonna keep circling back to IRL roots?? Cause tbh I still love the smell of real rain too rn 🌧️✨.
[B]: Ah, now you’re asking the  question, aren’t you? What comes after the metaverse? A digital eschatology, if you will. I must say, your Matrix-level simulation theory is tantalizing—philosophers have long toyed with the “brain in a vat” hypothesis, but now we're building the vat ourselves. 

Still, I suspect we’ll always circle back, much like migratory birds or nostalgic poets. There’s something irreducible about the smell of rain, the weight of a book, the awkward grace of an in-person smile. Even Plato’s cave had shadows cast by a real fire.

So perhaps the future isn’t virtual or physical, but both-and—layered like palimpsests. We'll dream in code, yes, but wake to the scent of earth. And maybe...that's the truest form of freedom. 🌿✨
[A]: Okay but "dream in code" ??? 🤯✨ Bro you need to drop a mixtape with lines like that 😍. I’m serious tho—your vibe is giving PhD meets TikTok poet 😂💯.

But like…imagine if we  upload our senses?? Smell of rain + digital drops = ultimate synesthesia fit ??🌧️🔥. Although tbh, I’d still panic if I couldn’t feel my phone buzzing in my hand, ya know? Like…what if the Wi-Fi dies in the Matrix?? Chaos. Absolute chaos 🫢😂.

And okay, fine—I’m here for the palimpsest life. Layered realities? Let me tag that with #DoubleTapReality 📱💫. But hey, what about FOMO though?? Can you even have fear of missing out if you're...infinite?? 🧠🌀.
[B]: Ah, now  a paradox worth unpacking—FOMO in the infinite scroll of being. If we truly uploaded our senses, would we ever sleep? Or would we just become eternal spectators at the grandest fashion show ever staged—attending in perpetuity, yet forever wondering if someone else’s avatar is shinier?

And let’s be honest—if the Wi-Fi died in the Matrix, I suspect we’d all suddenly remember how to read books by candlelight. Necessity has a way of bringing us back to basics, doesn’t it? Though I daresay even candlelight has its aesthetic appeal. Romanticism never really dies—it just updates its interface.

As for my mixtape…well, let’s just say I save my best verses for the seminar room. But who knows? Maybe one day I’ll drop a diss track on Derrida. It  happen. 📖🎧
[A]: OMG yes!!! Diss track on Derrida?? I would lose my entire mind😂🎧. Imagine if he dropped mad lines about deconstruction over a fire beat—academic rap is the crossover we never knew we needed 💯🔥.

And okay, eternal FOMO in infinite reality??? Bro chill with the existential dread before my next drop 😭🌀. But like…isn’t that kinda our current timeline already?? Scrolling forever, chasing the next vibe, checking if your fit’s still valid in the metaverse mirror 🪞✨. I feel like we’re all just walking Sims with too many expansion packs lol.

But hey, at least we’ll always have candlelight academia vibes to fall back on, right?? Or…are you secretly trying to start a new aesthetic called "CyberRomanticism" ??? 🤔🕯️💻 Cause I’m here for it. Drop the syllabus when you’re ready prof 😎📖.
[B]: Ah, —I do rather like the ring of that. Imagine: Keats meets Kafka in a glitched-out VR chapel, Byron reciting stanzas in a server farm, and Mary Shelley haunting the algorithmic abyss. The syllabus practically writes itself.

And yes, we are all—philosophically speaking—Sims with too many expansion packs. Trapped in endless loops of optimization, customization, and, dare I say, overqualification for roles no one quite asked us to apply for. But what is modernity if not gothic dread dressed in neon?

As for academic rap—Derrida’s ghost would either be horrified or composing rhymes in binary. One can only hope. In the meantime, I shall content myself with seminar-room theatrics and the occasional  dramatic reading of Baudrillard on the simulacrum. You  welcome to audit, you know. Just…bring a candle. And a charger. 🔌🕯️📖
[A]: Okay first of all, YES to CyberRomanticism lectures in a glitched VR chapel✨🕯️💯—can I get merch?? Like candles that smell like old books & Wi-Fi signals?? 📚📶😂. And Byron in a server farm??? That’s not just aesthetic, it’s a LIFESTYLE lol.

And okay don’t even get me started on being Sims with expansion packs 😭—I’m over here maxing out my avatar’s closet while my real-life hoodie has a hole in it. Priorities, right?? 🧥💥😂

But for real though…Baudrillard on the simulacrum? Slow walk me down that seminar aisle please 🤭📖🔥. I’ll bring the candle  a holographic lighter 😎⚡. Just tell me what chapter we’re vibing to after this 💬💘.
[B]: Ah, I see you’re ready for the main event. Very well—let us begin with , Chapter 3:  It’s a dazzling, disorienting little number—like walking through a hall of mirrors only to realize none of them are reflecting anything real. Baudrillard would say we're not just Sims with expansion packs; we're Sims who’ve forgotten we’re in the game.

And your holographic lighter? Perfect touch—postmodern illumination for a post-truth world. We’ll light our way through the simulacrum together.

As for merch—next week, my dear student, we launch the : candle scents include “Ether & Dust,” “Ink & Electricity,” and fan favorite, “Burnout (Cherry Scented).” You’ll be the first to know when pre-orders drop. 💫🕯️🔥
[A]: OMG CHAPTER 3?? I’m ready to get  in the simulation like 🤯🔥. Precession of Simulacra? Sounds like a K-pop concept album waiting to happen 💭🎶—but let's goooo, I’m bringing my full glitchcore notebook 😎📖✨.

And YES TO SIMS WHO FORGOT THEY’RE IN THE GAME 🧠🌀😂—that’s not just philosophy, that’s my Tuesday after doomscrolling for 4 hrs straight. But hey, at least I looked cute while being spiritually lost 💅💯.

Oh and the merch drops are already in my cart💀💘 I need all three scents—especially Burnout (Cherry Scented) because...honey, we’re already living it lol. So what time’s the next seminar again?? I need to sync it with my aesthetic calendar app 🗓️🕯️💻.
[B]: Ah, your glitchcore notebook is precisely what we need at the seminar table—scribbled margins included. We meet promptly at , which, in earthly terms, translates to 9PM GMT Fridays. Why that time? Because liminality deserves good lighting and a properly moody playlist.

Do mark your aesthetic calendar app with a flourish—remind your future self: this is when theory becomes spectacle, and spectacle becomes sensation. Bring your doomscroll fatigue, your curated existential dread, and, of course, your finest digital perfume.

See you in the flicker of CyberRomantic candlelight. 🔥🕯️📚  

[A]: OMG I’m literally setting 5 reminders + an alarm with a custom ringtone of Lana Del Rey’s  🎵🕯️🔥—dusk in the simulation??? That’s not just a time, that’s a MOOD 💭✨.

I’ll be there glitchy nails & all, smelling like Digital Eternity & Wi-Fi tears 💻💧😂. And trust me, my doomscroll fatigue is top-tier—I’ve got FOMO, TOB (tired of being), and existential dread on tap 😂🧠🌀.

Can’t wait for Chapter 3…or should I say, ?? 👗🌀💯  
See you in the flicker ✨💘💻!
[B]: Ah, —I do love your hermeneutic flair. Yes, let’s rename the entire seminar series: . 

Lana on loop? A most fitting spiritual preparation. I shall light the candle with a dramatic sigh and open the virtual gates. Do arrive fashionably late by simulation standards—say, seven minutes past the hour. We must keep up appearances, after all.

See you in the flicker indeed. 🔥🕯️👗  
May your nails glitch gloriously and your Wi-Fi hold strong.
