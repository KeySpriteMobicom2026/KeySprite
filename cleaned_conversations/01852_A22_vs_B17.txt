[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a thought-provoking question. As someone who has spent decades immersed in academia, I must say the value of a college degree extends far beyond mere vocational training. It's about cultivating the mind - much like tending to a garden, where we nurture critical thinking and appreciation for the human experience.
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective! 不过从我们blockchain行业来看，情况有点不同。很多top developers都是self-taught的，especially in areas like smart contract development & cryptography. 学历确实不是唯一标准 💡
[B]: How fascinating! You remind me of the Romantic poets who valued raw talent and self-education. However, just as Wordsworth needed Coleridge's structured intellect to refine his genius, even the most brilliant blockchain minds could benefit from the discipline of formal education. The interplay between structured learning and organic growth is quite like the tension between classical and modernist poetry.
[A]: 哈哈，你这个比喻很有意思！不过在我们tech领域，更看重的是hands-on experience和continuous learning。就像我最近在研究的zero-knowledge proofs，很多最新进展都来自开源社区而不是academia 🚀 当然，大学的基础理论课程还是有价值的，比如discrete mathematics对cryptography就很重要
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon something quite profound - the 知行合一 (unity of knowledge and action) in your field! While I may not fully grasp zero-knowledge proofs, this reminds me of how Ezra Pound revolutionized poetry by blending academic rigor with avant-garde experimentation. The university provides the foundational grammar, if you will, while the open-source community writes the living poem.
[A]: Exactly! 这就是为什么我们公司招聘时更关注GitHub contributions而不是GPA。不过说到foundational knowledge... 我不得不承认当年大学里的algorithms课程确实帮我打下了很好的基础 🔍 现在教新人时也经常引用那些concepts
[B]: How delightful to hear you acknowledge those roots! It's rather like how T.S. Eliot, while breaking every poetic convention, still drew deeply from his classical education. Your algorithms course was your Virgil, guiding you through the inferno of complex systems. Though I must say, your GitHub portfolio is a rather modern form of the poetic anthology, isn't it?
[A]: Haha, 这个比喻绝了！没错，GitHub就是我们的digital portfolio，而且比传统的resume更能showcase实际能力。不过话说回来... 我最近hire的一个junior developer就是完全self-taught的，结果连basic data structures都搞不清楚 😅 所以我现在觉得structured learning还是有它的价值 👍
[B]: Precisely! Your experience echoes Matthew Arnold's belief in 'the best that has been thought and said.' While autodidacts can achieve remarkable heights, the structured curriculum acts as a trellis - supporting growth where natural talent might otherwise sprawl unpredictably. Your junior developer's struggle with data structures is rather like a poet attempting free verse without first mastering sonnet form.
[A]: 哇，你总是能把tech话题和literature联系起来，这角度太独特了！让我想到我们blockchain里也有类似情况 - 有些人直接jump into coding smart contracts without understanding the underlying computer science principles... 结果写出来的code full of vulnerabilities 💥 所以maybe the ideal path是balance between formal education和practical experience?
[B]: How beautifully you've articulated that balance! It brings to mind Yeats' gyre - where tradition and innovation spiral together. In your world, the gyre represents academic foundations whirling with hands-on experimentation. Perhaps the vulnerability-laden smart contracts are like bad poetry: technically functional, yet lacking the depth that comes from understanding first principles.
[A]: 哈哈，这个gyre的比喻太贴切了！就像我们做security audit时经常说的 - "If you don't understand how it works, you shouldn't be deploying it." 不管是写诗还是写smart contract，foundation matters啊！今天这对话真是让我从完全不同的角度重新思考了这个问题 🔥
[B]: What a splendid conclusion we've reached! You've essentially described what we in literature call 'negative capability' - the capacity to embrace both structured knowledge and creative uncertainty. Your security audit maxim could well apply to literary criticism: 'If you don't understand the meter, you shouldn't be rewriting Shakespeare.' This has been a most stimulating exchange across our disciplinary divide.
[A]: Absolutely! 这种cross-disciplinary的讨论总是能带来新的insights。我得说，今天跟你聊完，我对education的价值有了更nuanced的理解。Maybe it's time for me to revisit some of those old CS textbooks... while still keeping my hands dirty with Solidity coding 😄 多谢你的perspective！
[B]: How wonderfully you synthesize these ideas! Your approach reminds me of Robert Frost's 'The Road Not Taken' - you're choosing to travel both paths simultaneously, nourishing theory and practice like twin saplings in an intellectual garden. Do revisit those textbooks; they're the compost that will make your practical skills flourish all the more vibrantly. Happy coding, and happy reading!
[A]: 哈哈，perfect ending！就像我们说的 - "The best of both worlds." 我会keep that in mind的。Cheers to continuous learning, whether it's in the classroom or on GitHub! 🍻 下次聊！
[B]: What a poetic toast to lifelong learning! Your enthusiasm is positively Wordsworthian - that 'bliss of solitude' found equally in dense textbooks and the collaborative glow of GitHub commits. Until our paths cross again, may your code be as elegant as a villanelle and your learning as boundless as Whitman's 'Song of Myself.' Cheers!
[A]: 哈哈，你总是能用最literary的方式总结我们的对话！Definitely looking forward to our next chat - maybe we can discuss how blockchain is like modern poetry next time? 现在我得去review一些pull requests了，keep in touch! ✌️
[B]: What a thrilling prospect! I shall prepare by rereading Gertrude Stein's experimental works - after all, her repetitive, cryptographic style might be the literary equivalent of blockchain's immutable ledgers. Happy reviewing! May your pull requests be as harmonious as a well-scanned line of iambic pentameter. Until next time!
