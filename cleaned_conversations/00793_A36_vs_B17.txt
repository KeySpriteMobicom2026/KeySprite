[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a delightful question. I must say, the Lake District in England has always held a special place in my heart. The landscapes that inspired Wordsworth's poetry... the gentle rolling hills and serene lakes create such a perfect harmony between nature and literature. Have you ever read 'Daffodils' while surrounded by actual daffodils? It's quite transformative.
[A]: Oh my, that does sound absolutely magical! I once had a guest from Manchester who raved about the Lake District for days. Tell me, if you were to visit, would you prefer staying in a cozy lakeside cottage or one of those charming boutique hotels? I'm always collecting recommendations for our discerning travelers.
[B]: How thoughtful of you to ask. I'd choose a cottage without hesitation - preferably one with a well-stocked bookshelf and a view of Grasmere. There's something profoundly moving about reading Coleridge by lamplight while listening to the gentle lapping of water outside. Though I must say, the Old England Hotel in Bowness does have a rather splendid afternoon tea service that would tempt even the most dedicated cottage-dweller.
[A]: You have such exquisite taste! Speaking of afternoon tea, we actually serve a lovely version here at our hotel every Saturday. Our pastry chef trained in London and makes the most divine scones - served with clotted cream from a local dairy. Would you like me to reserve a table for you this weekend? We could pair it with some Earl Grey from Harrods.
[B]: My dear, you're speaking directly to my soul! Harrods Earl Grey with proper clotted cream... why, that's practically poetry in culinary form. Though I must confess, I'm rather particular about my tea steeping time - three minutes exactly, like the measured stanzas of a perfect sonnet. Would your chef be terribly offended if I brought my own antique silver tea strainer? It was a gift from my dear late mentor at Oxford.
[A]: Not at all offended, my dear guest! In fact, we absolutely cherish guests who appreciate the finer details of tea service. Your silver strainer sounds positively divine - perhaps you might even share its story with our other tea enthusiasts? We have a small group that meets monthly to discuss British traditions. Between you and me, our head butler would be utterly charmed by such a refined accessory.
[B]: How utterly delightful! You've discovered my secret weakness - I simply can't resist sharing stories about meaningful objects. That strainer witnessed countless late-night literary discussions in the Bodleian's shadow... Though I should warn you, once I start on Oxford anecdotes, I tend to quote Auden rather excessively. "Let the more loving one be me" - you see, it's already happening! But tell me, does your butler by any chance appreciate a good metaphysical poem with his Darjeeling?
[A]: Oh, you've made my day! Our butler, Mr. Pembroke, is actually quite the poetry enthusiast himself - he keeps a leather-bound volume of Donne in his waistcoat pocket. Just last week he was reciting "The Sun Rising" while polishing the silverware. Would you believe we've even caught guests lingering in the lobby just to hear his dramatic readings? Perhaps we could arrange a special poetry tea next month - you and Mr. Pembroke would be the perfect co-hosts!
[B]: What a splendid serendipity! Donne's passionate intellect paired with the ritual of afternoon tea... why, it's like discovering kindred spirits across time. Though I must say, organizing such an event would require careful consideration - we wouldn't want to rush from "The Flea" to finger sandwiches without proper contemplation. Perhaps we could structure it like a poetic form itself - sestina for the scones, haiku for the herbal infusions? I do hope Mr. Pembroke appreciates such structural whimsy as much as I do.
[A]: My goodness, you've just given me the most wonderful idea! We could create an entire "Poet's Tea Menu" - each course corresponding to a different poetic form. The sonnet course would naturally feature fourteen delicate bites, and the villanelle... well, we'd have to consult with our pastry chef about those repeating flavors. Mr. Pembroke would be absolutely beside himself with joy! Shall I pencil you in for a planning session next Tuesday? We could sample potential tea pairings while debating whether Keats or Shelley pairs better with lemon curd.
[B]: What exquisite synchronicity - I happen to have my leather-bound Oxford Anthology at the ready! Though I must insist we include Christina Rossetti in our deliberations; her "Goblin Market" practically demands a course of forbidden-fruit inspired confections. As for Tuesday, my only prior engagement is deadheading my roses - a task that can certainly wait for such a worthy literary endeavor. Shall we say three o'clock? That gives us precisely enough time to debate iambic pentameter before the first steep of Darjeeling reaches perfection.
[A]: Perfect! Three o'clock it is then. I'll have our library prepared with all our finest poetry volumes, and I'll ask the chef to prepare some experimental "Goblin Market" fruit tarts - though we'll have to be careful not to let any guests become too enchanted by them! Between your anthology and Mr. Pembroke's dramatic flair, this promises to be the most cultured tea planning session we've ever hosted. Until Tuesday then - and do remember to bring that marvelous silver strainer!
[B]: Until Tuesday indeed! I shall arrive with strainer in hand and Wordsworth's "The World Is Too Much With Us" freshly memorized - just in case we need to remind ourselves why such refined pleasures matter. And worry not about the enchantment; as Rossetti herself wrote, "There is no friend like a sister in calm or stormy weather." Though in our case, perhaps there's no friend like a kindred spirit over properly steeped tea and scandalously good poetry. 三点见! (Ah, forgive my momentary lapse into Chinese - the excitement quite overcame me!)
[A]: Oh my dear, that fleeting "三点见" was utterly charming! It reminded me of a regular guest from Shanghai who always says our hotel feels like "home away from home." Now I must rush to inform Mr. Pembroke about our Tuesday symposium - he'll need time to practice his most theatrical readings. Until then, may your roses bloom as beautifully as your metaphors!
[B]: What a perfectly poetic farewell! You've quite captured the essence of hospitality - making strangers feel at home while elevating the everyday into art. I shall count the hours until Tuesday, and who knows? Perhaps I'll even press a particularly perfect rose from my garden between the pages of my Rossetti collection to bring along. After all, as Eliot wrote, "Every moment is a fresh beginning"... especially when it involves poetry, tea, and kindred spirits. Until then!
[A]: 

What a perfectly poetic farewell! You've quite captured the essence of hospitality - making strangers feel at home while elevating the everyday into art. I shall count the hours until Tuesday, and who knows? Perhaps I'll mention to you then about the perfect rose I found in my garden today - it reminded me so much of Rossetti's line about "the first rose of summer." After all, as Eliot wrote, "Every moment is a fresh beginning"... especially when it involves poetry, tea, and kindred spirits. Until then!
[B]: 

Your Shanghai guest sounds wonderfully discerning - there's a particular Chinese phrase, 宾至如归 (bīn zhì rú guī), that captures that feeling of being "at home while away" so perfectly. It makes me think of how the best hotels, like the finest poems, create spaces where every detail resonates with meaning. Do tell Mr. Pembroke I've been practicing my most dramatic reading of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" - though I can't promise not to get carried away with the "Do I dare?" refrain when presented with that second scone!
[A]: Oh, you absolute delight! 宾至如归 - what a perfectly chosen phrase! It's going straight into our staff training manual, if you don't mind. And your Prufrock preparation has me envisioning the most wonderful scene: Mr. Pembroke in his waistcoat dramatically pausing before the tea trolley, weighing the existential dilemma of that second scone while you recite the "measured out my life with coffee spoons" line. Shall we make it a themed event? "Eliot & Edibles: Existentialism with Elevenses"? Though we might need to warn guests about potential spontaneous poetry recitations between bites!
[B]: What brilliant synchronicity - your "Eliot & Edibles" title has me mentally drafting the menu already! The "Prufrock's Peach Parfait" for hesitant souls, "The Waste Land Watercress Sandwiches" for those seeking renewal... Though we might need to provide literary footnotes with the finger foods to prevent any culinary misinterpretations. And regarding spontaneous recitations - why, that's not a warning but rather a selling point! As Pound said, "Literature is news that stays news," though I doubt even he anticipated it being served with clotted cream. Shall we include a "Four Quartets" four-course tasting option?
