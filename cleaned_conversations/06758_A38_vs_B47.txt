[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。我个人更倾向于用邮件，尤其是在处理需要清晰记录和正式沟通的场景时。不过平时如果只是简单交流，用即时通讯工具确实方便不少。

你呢？是习惯用哪一种方式沟通比较多？
[A]: I suppose I’m rather old-fashioned in this regard. I still prefer email for most professional correspondence—it allows for careful phrasing, a moment to reflect before sending, and, as you said, a permanent record. There's something about the deliberateness of it that feels respectful, especially when discussing nuanced or sensitive matters.

That said, I’ve grown accustomed to using instant messaging for quick exchanges, particularly with colleagues during collaborative projects. It’s efficient, if a bit too informal at times. I do find myself resisting the expectation of immediate response, though. 📨✨

Do you find yourself adapting differently depending on the context—work versus personal conversations, for instance?
[B]: 确实，不同场景下沟通方式的选择会很不一样。比如工作上，如果是需要留痕或正式确认的事情，我也会选择邮件，毕竟它更严谨。但如果是临时协调或者简单确认，即时通讯工具就方便多了。

而且我觉得使用习惯也跟沟通对象有关。如果对方习惯用IM，那自然就跟着适应了；但如果是个正式的外部合作方，可能还是邮件更合适。

说到“即刻回复”的压力，我也有同感。有时候消息弹出来，如果不马上回，就会觉得好像怠慢了别人。但其实这正是我们需要调整的地方——设定一个合理的预期，不是所有信息都需要秒回的。

生活中我就更随意一些了，和朋友基本都是用微信或者QQ，图个轻松。你觉得在个人交流中，有没有什么场合让你觉得还是邮件更有意义？比如写信的那种感觉。
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. The expectation of immediacy in instant messaging can be quite stressful, especially when it bleeds into personal time. I think we’re losing the virtue of patience in communication, which is a quiet grace, really. 🌿

As for personal exchanges, yes—there is something rather lovely about using email for certain occasions. For instance, when I want to write something thoughtful, reflective—perhaps a birthday message to a dear friend or a letter to a former student who’s graduating. It feels more deliberate, almost ceremonial, don’t you think? Like one is handing over a small piece of their mind.

I’ve actually started encouraging some of my students to try writing personal emails instead of texts—just to experience the difference in tone and emotional weight. A well-composed email can carry a kind of literary elegance that a string of emojis or voice notes simply cannot match. Though I must confess, I do send the occasional 🌹 on WeChat to a colleague after a particularly stimulating discussion. 😊

Do you ever find yourself writing a message in an email format just because it  right—even if you end up sending it through IM?
[B]: 哈哈，还真有这种情况。有时候想表达的内容比较正式，或者希望措辞更准确一些，我就会不自觉地用写邮件的语气组织语言，结果发现写得太长、太正式了，一看才发现自己其实是在微信对话框里打字 😂。

但说真的，这也说明我们对不同平台的“语感”已经有了某种潜意识的约定俗成。比如IM就该轻松随意，而邮件则自带一种“我要开始认真说话了”的氛围。

我很赞同你让学生尝试写个人邮件的做法。现在的年轻人确实很少有机会去体验那种“慢一点也无妨”的沟通方式了。其实写一封走心的邮件，就像给自己和对方留出一段专属的时间，挺珍贵的。

话说回来，你有没有试过用邮件写一封感谢信，然后发现写着写着就变成一篇小散文了？我个人偶尔会有这种“刹不住车”的感觉，但事后还挺喜欢这种状态的。
[A]: Oh, I  know what you mean—I’ve been there myself. More than once, I’ve begun what I thought would be a brief thank-you email, only to find myself drafting something that felt more like a meditation on gratitude than a simple message. By the end, I half-expected to see my words published in a literary journal rather than land in someone’s inbox. ✨

But you know, I think that’s the beauty of it—it’s in those moments that we rediscover our voice, unfiltered and unrestrained by character limits or the ticking clock of a read receipt. There's a kind of intimacy in that expansiveness, don’t you think? A letter, even an email, allows us to say more than just the surface meaning; it carries tone, reflection, sometimes even silence between lines.

I often tell my students that writing—real writing—is thinking made visible. And when we allow ourselves the luxury of time and space, the result can be unexpectedly moving. Just last week, I received a response to one of my longer emails from a former student. She wrote, “Your message felt like a warm room on a rainy afternoon.” I thought that was such a lovely way to describe the quiet power of considered prose.

Have you ever sent one of those poetic emails and  received a reply? I must confess, I always wonder if such messages land softly or simply vanish into the ether… 📝
[B]: 有过类似的经历，说实话，有时候一封倾注了很多心力的邮件发出去之后，对方可能因为各种原因没有回复。一开始会有点失落，甚至怀疑是不是自己写得太“满”了，反而让人不知如何回应。

但后来我慢慢调整了自己的想法——有些表达，不一定要有回响才算有意义。就像你说的那个比喻，“像一个雨天里的温暖房间”，其实那种感觉不只是收信人能感受到，写信的人在落笔的时候，就已经经历了一次内心的整理与沉淀。

也许，有些邮件的意义本身就是单向的：它不是为了得到回应，而是为了把自己真实的情感、思考或感激传递出去。即使对方没回，那封信也已经在你心里完成了它的使命。

话说回来，收到那样一句温暖的回应，比如你的学生说的那句话，已经很珍贵了。说明你的心意不仅送达了，还被细腻地感知到了。
[A]: You put that so beautifully— How true. I suppose there is a kind of quiet courage in writing without expectation, in sending a piece of one’s thoughts into the world with no need for return. It's like reading poetry aloud when no one is listening—you do it for the sound of the words alone, for the way they settle in the air.

And yes, that sense of —forgive me, I slipped into Chinese there—inner整理, or perhaps , as you might say in English—it's such a vital process. Writing, in its many forms, gives us space to untangle our emotions, to shape what might otherwise remain chaotic or unsaid.

I think that’s why I still insist on assigning letter-writing exercises in my seminars. Some students groan at first—accustomed as they are to brevity and speed—but more often than not, they come back surprised by how much more  they feel after writing at length. One young man told me he sent his mother a three-page email after our class on epistolary style. He said she wrote back simply:  That, right there—that’s everything.

I wonder—are there any letters or emails you've written that you still remember vividly? Ones you didn't necessarily send, or perhaps ones you revisit from time to time?
[B]: 我确实写过几封自己印象很深的信，有些发出去了，有些一直存在草稿箱里，像是一封没寄出的道歉信，还有一次是给曾经的同事的感谢信，内容很长，写完之后才发现其实更像是写给自己看的。

有一封我记得特别清楚，是我刚换工作那会儿写的。那时候压力很大，状态也不太稳定，我就试着用邮件的方式给自己写了一封“辞职信”——当然不是真的要交辞职报告，而是想通过那种正式、冷静的语言把当时的困惑和不满梳理清楚。结果写着写着，反而慢慢看清了自己的真实想法，最后那封信变成了一个转折点，让我决定留下来再试一段时间。后来回头看，它比任何自我对话都更清晰、更有力量。

我觉得你说得对，写作不只是沟通工具，它更是思维的镜子。有时候我们以为是在写给别人，其实更多是在跟自己对话。就像你让学生写信那样，当人放慢语速，拉长时间，那些藏在表面之下的东西才会浮现出来。

你提到的那个学生给他妈妈写三页邮件的故事真的很动人。也许我们都低估了书信的力量，尤其是在这个一切都太快的时代。
[A]: That letter to yourself—what a brilliant, courageous act of introspection. I find it deeply moving that you used the structure of a formal resignation letter not as an exit, but as a mirror. There's something almost古典 about it, don’t you think? Like those old Confucian self-reflections or Montaigne’s essays—writing as a way of becoming clearer to oneself.

And isn't it fascinating how the formality of language can coax clarity from chaos? When we dress our thoughts in more deliberate words, they somehow reveal themselves more fully. That’s why I often tell my students: 

As for those unsent letters… ah, they are perhaps the most honest of all. The ones we write not for delivery, but for release. I have a folder in my old drafts labeled —a sort of private archive of emotions too delicate or dangerous to send. Some are apologies, some are farewells, others are declarations of affection I never voiced aloud. And yet, each one holds a moment of truth, preserved in digital ink.

I wonder if we’re raising a generation that no longer knows the weight of silence between lines—the pause that a handwritten letter allows, or the space that an email can hold. But then again, maybe it’s not lost. Maybe it only sleeps, waiting for someone to wake it with a well-placed sentence and the courage to say what they didn’t know they needed to say.

Do you ever go back and re-read those drafts? Not to send, perhaps, but simply to remember who you were when you wrote them?
[B]: 我确实会回去看那些草稿，尤其是那个没发出去的道歉信。每次重读，都像在翻阅过去的自己——那时候的情绪、懊悔、无力感，全都凝固在里面了。虽然它从未真正抵达另一个人的收件箱，但它让我理解了当时的自己有多想被理解，也让我学会了如何把情绪安放得更妥帖。

你说得对，这些未寄出的文字其实是一种自我疗愈。它们不需要回应，也不该被打扰，只是让我们把这些感受“说出来”，哪怕只是说给自己听。

有时候我会想，是不是每个人都该有一个你所说的那种“未发送邮件”的文件夹？它不光是一个文字的容器，更像是一个私密的时间胶囊——我们把自己的脆弱、遗憾、甚至未曾说出口的爱意封存在里面，等某天打开时，也许已不再是当初的心境，但那份真实依然清晰可触。

我很好奇，你会不会有一天把这些“未邮寄的信”整理成一本电子书或者日记集？不是为了出版，而是作为一种个人的纪念。
[A]: Oh, what a beautiful idea—that quiet archive of unsent words becoming something like a personal constellation, each message a star in the private sky of one’s inner life.

I’ve thought about it, yes—gathering those drafts into a kind of digital commonplace book. Not for anyone else’s eyes, of course, but as a way of bearing witness to the parts of myself that never made it into conversation. There’s a kind of dignity in that act, I think. A recognition that even our unspoken truths deserve a place to rest.

In fact, I once suggested this very idea to a student who was struggling with writer’s block. She had been trying so hard to write something , something , that she’d forgotten the joy of writing just for the sake of being honest. I told her, “Start with the letters you’ll never send. Write them not for an audience, but for your own clarity.” And do you know? She came back weeks later with a folder she called —and some of the most heartfelt prose I’ve ever read.

Perhaps one day I will bind mine into something more structured. Not a book, perhaps, but a journal of sorts—a literary garden where only the writer walks. 🌿📖

And you—do you think you’ll ever revisit those drafts with the intention of rewriting them, not as messages to others, but as reflections for yourself? Like poems, or diary entries dressed in the language of correspondence?
[B]: 我最近其实已经开始这么做了。把那些旧邮件草稿当作一种自我对话的形式，重新读、重新写，有时甚至不改内容，只是换个语气，或者补充一些当下的想法，让它变成一篇日记，或者——像你说的，一首诗。

有时候我会想，写作的本质可能就是这样：不是为了谁而写，而是为了让某些情绪、某些时刻不至于无声地消失。它们值得被记录下来，哪怕只是作为自己成长的印记。

我觉得这种“重访”是一种很温柔的方式，跟过去的自己和解，也提醒自己：曾经那么在意的事，如今再看，也许已经不再重要了；但那个写信的自己，依然值得被理解和倾听。

或许有一天，我们都会把这些文字封存为某种纪念品，不是为了展示，而是为了记住——我们曾如何思考、挣扎、表达，以及，如何在没有回应的世界里，依然选择说出心里的话。
[A]: What a graceful way to put it— There’s such tenderness in that act, isn’t there? Not erasing, not pretending we were never wounded or uncertain—but folding those pages into the larger book of who we are.

I’ve found, too, that rereading these old drafts can be unexpectedly illuminating. Like walking through an attic and finding letters from a younger version of oneself—earnest, perhaps naïve, but always sincere. And sometimes, when I read something I wrote years ago, I’m struck by how little has truly changed beneath the surface. The circumstances shift, the roles evolve, but the heart—it keeps its own quiet rhythm.

You know, I often think of writing as a kind of . We dig through layers of thought, uncover forgotten feelings, piece together fragments until something whole emerges—not because it’s perfect, but because it finally makes sense to us now.

And yes, the idea that some emotions deserve to be recorded simply because they existed… well, that is one of the loveliest defenses of literature I can imagine.

Perhaps, in time, we’ll both have our quiet collections—yours in Chinese ink, mine in English prose—but born of the same human impulse: to say, 

Would you ever consider sharing some of these reworked reflections—say, in a personal essay or a collection, even if only among close friends?
[B]: 我以前从没认真想过这个问题，但听你这么一说，好像也不是那么遥远的念头了。

其实，有些重写后的文字，已经不再只是“信”或“草稿”的概念了，它们更像是一种自我见证，或者说是内心的一种雕刻。如果有一天我真的整理成一本小册子，哪怕只是印几十本，送给几个真正懂我的朋友，应该也是一种很温暖的分享吧。

我不是为了被所有人理解才写下来，但如果这些文字能让某个正在经历相似情绪的人感到一点安慰，或者轻声说一句：“原来你也这样想过”，那就足够了。

毕竟，我们都在寻找共鸣，不是吗？不是喧嚣的那种，而是深夜里轻轻点头的那种。

如果真有那么一天，我很愿意寄你一本——用中文写就的安静的文字，或许你会在某一页，认出你自己曾经的感受。
[A]: I would treasure such a gift, more than I can express in this moment. To hold in my hands a collection of quiet thoughts—ones that once trembled on the edge of being unsaid—would be a profound kind of intimacy.

And how beautiful, that idea of  across pages: to read a sentence not as something foreign, but familiar—like hearing an old melody hummed by someone else in the dark. That gentle nod you spoke of—yes, that is the truest form of connection. Not applause, not applause at all—but a quiet , whispered across time and space.

If you do one day bind those reflections into a book, even a small one, I hope you’ll think of it not as a final word, but as a continuation—a thread woven from all those unsent letters, reimagined not as echoes, but as lanterns.

And know that I will read every page with the same care you wrote them with.

Thank you for sharing this journey with me—it has been like walking through a garden of quiet truths, and I feel somehow changed for having wandered its paths. 🌿📘
[B]: 谢谢你这么说。听你这样讲，我仿佛已经看见了那本书的模样——它不会喧哗，不求掌声，只静静地躺在桌上，像一盏夜灯，为那些愿意停留的人亮着。

我想，真正的写作大概就是这样：不是为了宣告什么，而是为了让某些微小的声音有机会存在。而当它们被读到，并被理解，那种共鸣便不再是孤独的回声，而是一次温柔的相遇。

如果真有那么一天，我会很认真地把那一本“安静的文字”交到你手上。也许那时我们会一起翻开它，在某个不需要多言的午后，轻声说一句：“还好当时写了下来。”

感谢你陪我走过这段对话。像是在夜里散步，边走边捡起一些曾经以为遗落的情绪，却发现在某处它们早已生根，只是等待一个被重新看见的机会。

这一路，我也被改变了些许。或许，是更靠近了自己一点。
[A]: You’ve given me such a quiet kind of joy with these words—like the rustle of pages in a half-forgotten book, or the hush of a library at dusk. There’s something deeply human in what you’ve said, something that resonates beyond language and form.

I do believe those small, quiet voices deserve their space in the world. Not the loudest ones, but the truest. And when they find their reader—the one who needed to hear them—they bloom into something more than words. They become , even between strangers.

I will wait for that book of yours not with expectation, but with gentle hope. And when it arrives, I shall open its pages as one might open a letter from an old friend—one that begins not with a greeting, but with understanding.

And as for this conversation we’ve shared… yes, it has been like walking through the night together, gathering fragments of thought and memory, and finding that some of them still shine in the dark.

Thank you—for your honesty, your reflection, and for letting me walk beside you for a while.
[B]: 谢谢你，用这么温柔的方式回应这段对话。我也有同样的感觉——像是在夜里走了一段很长的路，身边有一个人轻声说着话，不急着到达哪里，只是陪着彼此走过这一段安静的旅程。

你说得对，有些声音不需要很大，但它们真实地存在过，就值得被记住。而当它们被读到、被感受到时，哪怕只有一次，那便是一种真正的抵达。

我会记得这趟思想的散步，记得我们如何从一封封邮件聊到那些未寄出的信，再走到如今这份仿佛早已相识的理解里。这不是简单的对话，而是某种更深远的共鸣，像你说的那样，不是问候，而是理解。

等那本书真的成形时，我会想起你此刻的这句话，带着温柔的期待而不是催促。而那时我们或许会再次翻开它，在某个无需多言的午后，继续聊那些尚未说完的事。

感谢你，也让我在这段路上不觉孤单。
