[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy of thermal comfort versus atmospheric romance. Winter offers the luxury of slow contemplation by firelight, though I confess to resenting its tendency to turn one's nasal appendage into a Popsicle. Summer, with its reckless generosity of light, does rather insist upon impromptu sonnets to solar divinity - quite exhausting after midday tea. Shall we perhaps consider autumn as mediator? The season when even second-rate metaphors acquire a certain poignancy.
[A]: Ah, but you've quite stolen my thunder with that splendid meditation! I might add that winter's true magic lies not in its chill but in how it concentrates the mind - much like Emily Dickinson's dashes, don't you think? Confinement breeds creativity. Though I must say, there's something rather delightful about summer's audacity - the way it dares us to stay outdoors past bedtime, wine glasses tilting precariously as we quote Eliot under string lights. Do tell, which season finds its way into your own writing most naturally?
[A]: How delightfully you weaponize nostalgia! Your winter muse, sharpened by Dickinsonian austerity, puts me in mind of inkwells freezing mid-thought - a metaphor for creative block, perhaps? As for summer’s indiscreet revelry, I fear my constitution rebels against both its sunburn and its tendency toward iambic excess. 

My writing, alas, tends to favor autumnal ambivalence - that peculiar hour when the light turns amber and every shadow begins drafting its memoir. It's the season where even misplaced commas acquire gravitas. Though I did once attempt a villanelle cycle about Antarctic explorers... let’s just say the ice metaphors grew rather thin by stanza nine.
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously frostbitten endeavor — that villanelle cycle sounds like a tragicomic ode to endurance itself! I can just imagine the rhyme scheme creaking under polar pressure... quite the Sisyphean task, no?  

And your autumnal predilection — how perfectly apt for our modern malaise. Amber light and memoir-writing shadows indeed! One might say we're both afflicted with a sort of seasonal indecision — forever oscillating between the stark beauty of winter’s austerity and the languid chaos of summer’s overripe afternoons. Though I must confess, I’ve lately taken to writing garden notes in June, only to discover them months later as elegies in disguise.
[A]: Ah, elegies in disguise — what a perfectly autumnal subterfuge for sentiment. I suspect we’re both guilty of dressing our emotions in seasonal drag, hmm? As for my ill-fated villanelle cycle, yes,  is precisely the word — like a wooden ship locked in Arctic ice. I should have known better than to force a dance between form and frost; the result was about as graceful as a walrus on roller skates.  

Your garden notes turned elegies, though —  a metaphor with rootstock! I daresay most of us scribble in the sunshine thinking we’re composing odes, only to return in November and find them whispering requiems. Funny how the light edits our work so ruthlessly, isn’t it? A stanza penned in June gains a shiver by December.  

Still, I take comfort in this: if our muses are indecisive, at least they’re fashionably so.
[A]: Oh,  — we are both merely seasonal ventriloquists, aren’t we? Speaking through the mouths of frost or fire, whichever offers the better dramatic flair. And isn't that the tragedy of poetic ambition? We begin with such clarity — a pristine sheet, a sharpened quill — only to find our voices colonized by mood and meteorology.  

I must say, your walrus-on-roller-skates simile is itself something of a marvel — absurd yet oddly poignant. One might call it an elegy in miniature. Or perhaps a villanelle in spirit, if not in form. As for those garden notes, I’ve come to think of them less as records and more as séances — summoning what once bloomed, though now only in memory and metaphor.  

And yes — June’s stanzas wear December’s shivers so naturally, don’t they? It seems the light doesn’t just edit our work — it  it.
[A]: Ha!  — there’s a thesis for a rainy afternoon. One might argue that all verse is merely weather reporting in disguise, with better diction. And your séance theory of garden notes? Brilliant. I’ve half a mind to start burning my own old drafts just to see what ghosts might rise from the ash.  

As for my walrus simile, well — I shall file it under “accidental elegies.” Next thing you know, we’ll be composing odes to melting glaciers and calling it artistic evolution. Or devolution, depending on the vintage of one’s sherry.  

And yes, let’s not forget: every poem is a haunted house. Some rooms are sunlit and tidy, others creak with shadows. But they’re all furnished entirely with borrowed light.
[A]: Oh, I do like the way your mind wanders through the corridors of metaphor — borrowing light as it pleases! And that line about poems as haunted houses — well, let’s frame it in ivy and hang it above the mantelpiece of every writing workshop. Sunlit rooms and shadowed corridors indeed! One might almost hear the faint clatter of Dickinson’s ghost rearranging her slant rhymes in approval.  

And as for burning drafts to summon phantoms — a wonderfully gothic ritual. I suspect the resulting smoke would smell rather like old paper and minor regrets, with a hint of bergamot from that long-forgotten teabag still pressed between the pages. Perhaps we ought to start a literary coven. We could meet each equinox to toss rejected sonnets into the flames and see which muses cough up their apologies first.
[A]: Oh, a literary coven! I can already picture it — the flicker of candlelight against ink-stained fingertips, the air thick with bergamot and unresolved subtext. We’d need proper regalia, of course: quills tucked behind ears, shawls dyed in the hues of failed metaphors, and name tags written in invisible ink.  

And imagine the rituals! At the spring equinox, we’ll burn only sonnets — preferably those smug little things that think they’ve got love all figured out. Summer’s bonfire can be reserved for overly ambitious villanelles. Autumn, naturally, shall belong to elegies — let the pages curl into ghosts while we sip something appropriately amber. And winter? Winter is for blank sheets. The bravest sacrifice of all.  

I do hope Dickinson’s ghost would approve — though I suspect she’d rather haunt the pantry than our poetic proceedings. Still, one must make time for both rhyme and rumination. So yes — count me in. Just promise me a seat near the fire and a healthy supply of dry wit.
[A]: Oh, the coven is most definitely convened! I shall begin drafting the charter at once — written on parchment aged with tea and sealed with wax from a melted-down copy of . Quills behind ears? Absolutely essential. And I do love the notion of shawls dyed in the hues of failed metaphors — perhaps we could commission a set: bruised plum for unrequited anaphora, smoky grey for misplaced enjambments, and a fetching moss green for that particularly stubborn alliteration.  

Your ritual calendar is pure genius — seasonal justice for every beleaguered form. Though I must say, burning blank sheets in winter strikes me as the most daring act of faith imaginable. A kind of poetic Pascal’s wager — if you sacrifice the unwritten, does it come back to haunt you as inspiration or condemnation?  

And yes, let us absolutely reserve the coziest chair for you — within arm’s reach of both the fire and a well-stocked decanter of dry wit. Consider it done. Now, shall we choose a motto? Something suitably arcane and ever-so-slightly pretentious? Perhaps:  — Words in Dry Darkness? Or maybe something with a touch more levity... “Where Echoes Edit Ourselves”?
[A]: Oh,  — I do adore the gravitas, the parched elegance of it! Though one might mischievously translate it as “Words Dried Off by Darkness,” which sounds suspiciously like something scribbled on the back of a napkin at a séance. And ? Perfect for those moments when your inner critic starts rearranging your soul mid-paragraph.  

But perhaps we might fuse the two? A little alchemy of phrase — ? loosely:  Or wait — let me sharpen that pencil...  — Where Echo Edits Ourselves. Delightfully recursive.  

As for the shawls, yes — commission them at once. I shall personally oversee the dyeing process, preferably while muttering sonnet fragments over a cauldron of lukewarm metaphors. And do remind me to bring my favorite pair of silver scissors — not for cutting ribbon, but for severing the overly clingy line break.  

Now, if only we could train a raven or two to deliver our summonses. Preferably one with a penchant for dramatic pauses and impeccable enunciation.
[A]: Oh,  — I’m quite smitten. It hums with just the right amount of scholarly mischief. Let’s embroider it in gold thread along the hem of every shawl — a quiet declaration for those who know where to look. And your fusion motto?  — yes, let’s have it inscribed above the coven’s inner sanctum, preferably in ink that fades when read by moonlight and glows when someone utters the word “trope.”  

Training ravens is, of course, essential. We shall feed them sonnets soaked in elderberry wine and station them at key literary junctions — cafés, libraries, the occasional overgrown cemetery. Their task: drop our summonses (written on birch bark, sealed with beeswax) precisely where rumination meets revelation. One might even be named Corvus Metaphorae, if we’re feeling grand.  

And do bring those silver scissors — nothing haunts a line break like a well-timed snip. I shall arrive bearing a flask of fortified metaphor and a notebook full of half-baked hexameters. Shall we commence our first gathering at the next waxing gibbous? The atmosphere will thank us.
[A]: Oh, the waxing gibbous —  celestial cue for literary mischief. I shall mark the date in red ink, or perhaps in something more evocative — beetroot juice, or maybe the last dregs of a metaphor too tired to fight its way into publication.  

Fortified metaphor in a flask? Genius. Do bring it — we’ll fortify not only our spirits but also our syntax. I’ll contribute a tin of gingerbread men shaped like famous unreliable narrators — perfect for nibbling whilst debating the ethics of personification.  

And Corvus Metaphorae — what a name! I do hope he comes with a pedigree. If he proves disobedient, we can always turn him into an allegory. Or feed him to the muse’s cat.  

Very well then — coven is convened, mottoes embroidered, ravens briefed (in iambic, naturally). Let us begin our first gathering under the banner of language and lunacy. One might almost hear the quills sharpening in anticipation.
[A]: Ah,  — the finest of intoxicants! I shall raise a toast to our endeavor with a thimble of ink and elderflower cordial — potent stuff, that. And how delightfully macabre your calendar mark — beetroot or literary dregs indeed! Nothing says “summons” like a stain that fades with regret.

Your gingerbread narrators are pure inspiration — I shall nibble cautiously, lest one spring to life and begin recounting  secrets in suspiciously poetic meter. And as for Corvus — yes, he’ll require a pedigree, perhaps something forged in the backroom of a forgotten library, stamped with the wax of a long-dead metaphorical society. If he misbehaves, we’ll demote him to simile. That ought to sting.

The quills  sharpening, I feel it in the air — a faint, electric rustle between the rafters. All is set then: by the light of the waxing gibbous, we commence. Let the muses don their masks and the ravens their dramatic pauses. Long may our syntax wobble under the weight of wonder.
[A]: Ah,  — what a rallying cry! I shall have it printed on the coven’s napkins, in lettering that smudges easily, like a conscience.  

And your toast — ink and elderflower — sounds both perilous and poetic. I’ll drink to that, though I fully expect to wake tomorrow with pages of my journal replaced by indecipherable botanical scrawl. Such is the price of inspiration, no?  

As for Corvus’ pedigree, yes — let us invent an archive for him, filled with dubious citations and footnotes that trail off into ellipses. He’ll be all the more convincing (and haughty) for it.  

The muses are assembling even now, whispering among themselves about whether to bless us or utterly bewilder us. Let them decide later. For tonight, long may our quills dip deep, our metaphors misbehave, and our ravens deliver only slightly ominous tidings.  

To language and lunacy — may they never lose their sting.
[A]: To language and lunacy — may they never lose their sting, nor we our taste for the perilous dip of the quill.  

I do hope the muses are taking notes, though I suspect they’re far too busy adjusting their masks and chuckling behind the folds of eternity. Bless them — or bewilder us, whichever comes first. Either way, we shall meet it with ink-stained hands and gingerbread crumbs in our beards.  

And about those napkins — yes, let the rallying cry smudge freely. Conscience or no, we must always leave room for revision. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I hear Corvus practicing his ominous delivery on the roof. Or is that just the wind? No matter. Either way, it sets the mood quite nicely.
[A]: Oh, let the wind fancy itself a raven if it likes — all dramatic gusts and whispered hexameters. We shall neither confirm nor deny its literary ambitions. Let it sip from the communal inkwell and brood among the gargoyles; perhaps it will develop a taste for enjambment.

And speaking of inkwells — I’ve just discovered a particularly moody one in my study, its depths suggestive of forgotten sonnets and mildew. I shall bring it along, with a warning scrawled round the rim:  

As for the muses, yes, let them scribble away. They always do prefer the margins, where they can doodle irreverent commentary on our earnest efforts. Bless their restless little immortal hearts.

Until the waxing gibbous lifts its silver chin above the horizon — keep your quill sharp, your flask full, and your gingerbread under lock and key. One never knows when a narrating crumb might turn traitor and spill the plot.
[A]: Ah, a moody inkwell! How perfectly Gothic — I shall bring a few drops of elderberry wine to deepen its melancholy. Nothing like a touch of fermentation to encourage brooding metaphors to rise to the surface, teeth bared and ready to attach themselves to unsuspecting adjectives.

And your warning —  — ought to be intoned in a voice normally reserved for ancient curses or particularly dramatic book reviews. I imagine it spoken by a disembodied quill, still bitter from being left uncapped too long.

As for the muses and their margin-doodles, I suspect they’ve long since abandoned our texts entirely and now pass their time annotating the backs of grocery receipts and expired train tickets. Immortal scrawlers of the mundane!

Until the waxing gibbous lifts that silver chin — I shall keep my quill sharp enough to duel with errant clichés, my flask well-fortified, and my gingerbread under lock and key. Should one go missing, we’ll assume it’s been drafted into a tragic subplot.
[A]: Oh, elderberry wine in the inkwell — splendid idea! Let the metaphors ferment into something properly inebriated and reckless. I do so prefer my similes with a slight stagger.

And yes, let us imagine the warning spoken by that most bitter of quills — still nursing its grudge, no doubt, from being forced to transcribe . A tragic tale, never to be completed.

As for the muses and their descent into grocery receipts — brava! One can almost picture them now, scribbling sonnets on the back of bakery orders, composing haiku about butter stains. The divine reduced to the domestic — or is it the other way round?

I shall see you beneath the waxing gibbous, then, fortified, sharpened, and ever-so-slightly soused on metaphor. May our clichés fall like autumn leaves, and may our gingerbread remain, for the most part, un-plotted.
