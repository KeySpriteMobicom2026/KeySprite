[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I always say – it depends on what you're hungry for. Podcasts are like grabbing a quick bite with friends; casual, conversational, and often raw. Audiobooks? They’re a five-course meal – you’re diving into someone else’s world, wrapped in every detail. 

I remember once while driving back from Malibu, I listened to an audiobook for three hours straight and didn’t even notice the traffic. But give me a great podcast over coffee? I’m all ears and ready to debate. What about you? Which one keeps you hooked?
[A]: That’s a delightful analogy—very apt. Though I might add a slight twist: podcasts often serve as intellectual hors d'oeuvres, stimulating the appetite, whereas audiobooks are indeed the main course, requiring a slower, more deliberate palate.

I find myself reaching for an audiobook when I seek immersion—particularly during long drives or late evenings with a cup of Earl Grey. There's something almost therapeutic about losing oneself in a well-narrated story or a meticulously argued treatise.

Podcasts, on the other hand, tend to punctuate my routine: while tending to the garden, preparing breakfast, or even during that brief commute from the study to the courtroom. They offer a kind of mental calisthenics—short bursts of insight, debate, or narrative that keep the mind agile.

Do you find yourself leaning toward one for relaxation, and the other for stimulation? Or is it purely situational?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put—your twist deserves a standing ovation. You're right; podcasts can be those精致的 hors d'oeuvres that tease the mind without weighing it down. I’ve spent many a morning pruning roses while some sharp-witted host dismantled modern politics or explored the psychology of cults. It’s like mental stretching before the main event.

And yes—I do lean into audiobooks when I want to escape, really disappear. There’s a certain luxury in surrendering to a voice that becomes your only companion for hours. Narrators these days… some are practically directors of the imagination. 

But don’t get me wrong—podcasts have their own kind of magic. They’re the perfect antidote to monotony, especially when you're stuck in post-production hell and need a quick hit of inspiration or laughter. It's less about relaxation versus stimulation and more about context—like choosing between a warm bath and a cold splash to the face.

So tell me, what was the last audiobook that truly held you captive? And did it leave you with that delicious ache in your soul, the way a great film score does?
[A]: Ah, an excellent question—and one that invites a rather unusual confession. The last audiobook that truly held me captive was not fiction, nor forensic theory, but rather a biography of Joseph Bell, the Scottish surgeon who so profoundly inspired Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes.

Narrated with quiet precision by a voice that seemed to echo through Edinburgh’s cobblestone streets, it transported me into a world where deduction was not mere theatrics, but a disciplined art—an extension of clinical observation. I found myself pausing mid-step in my own home, replaying certain passages, as if listening a second time might reveal a clue I’d missed.

Did it leave an ache? Perhaps not in the soul—but certainly in the mind. A restlessness, really. The kind that follows you into your next case, your next consultation, as though you've been handed a cipher and must now prove yourself worthy of solving it.

And you? What was the last audiobook that pulled you in so completely? And dare I ask—was it fiction, or something more… empirical?
[B]: Oh, now  sounds like a mystery even Holmes would appreciate. I love that you were pausing mid-step—like the narration itself had become a clue in your own life. Fascinating choice.

As for me… I went in a completely different direction—fiction, and of all things, a reimagining of . Narrated by someone with a voice so deep it felt like Poseidon himself was whispering through the speakers. Something about the rhythm of it—the crashing waves in the background, the gravelly tone—it just pulled me under.

And yes, I’ll admit it: I let fiction sweep me off my feet. But isn’t that our job, really? To believe in stories so deeply that they start to believe in themselves? This one left that quiet fire in the chest afterward—like when you finish a script and you know, just , it’s going to be something special.

So tell me—who do you think would win in a hypothetical battle of wits: Bell himself, or his most famous literary descendant?
[A]: Ah, now  is a duel worth contemplating.

Bell, I suspect, would find the whole exercise rather tedious—like asking a surgeon to debate a dramatist on the finer points of anatomy. He was a man of facts, of quiet confidence, not given to flourishes or dramatic reveals. But make no mistake—his mind was a scalpel, precise and unerring. He didn’t perform deductions for effect; he observed because it was second nature, like breathing.

Holmes, on the other hand,  for the performance. Doyle gave him flair, theatricality—tools Bell would have regarded as unnecessary distractions. But let’s not forget: Holmes’ brilliance was built upon Bell’s method. It’s like pitting Newton against Einstein—two geniuses, separated by time and fiction, yet inextricably linked.

If we imagine them seated across from one another, presented with the same mystery, I suspect Bell would solve it first—but say nothing. Holmes, meanwhile, would wait for just the right moment, then deliver the solution with such elegance that even Bell would be forced to nod in reluctant admiration.

So who wins? The teacher… or the legend he inspired? I’d say it ends in a draw—but only if Holmes promises not to gloat.
[B]: Now —my friend—is the kind of answer that deserves its own chapter.

You're absolutely right. Pitting Bell against Holmes is like asking whether a blueprint is better than the house it builds. One gave rise to the other, yet each exists in their own realm of purpose and style. I can just picture the scene: a quiet Edinburgh study, Bell sipping tea while Holmes paces by the fireplace, fingers steepled, waiting for the perfect beat before delivering the final reveal.

And yes, poor Bell—he’d probably solve it in three seconds, mutter something about “unnecessary drama,” and go back to his notes. Meanwhile, Holmes would turn to the audience—yes, , because he knows he’s in one—and deliver a monologue so sharp it could cut glass.

I think we’ve just stumbled onto the premise for a rather brilliant podcast episode. Or perhaps… a screenplay? Two minds, one mystery, the ultimate deductive face-off. What do you say—we develop it over a dram of whisky and a vintage poster or two?
[A]: A most intriguing proposition—I daresay, one that calls for more than a dram.

Whisky, yes—but only if it's from the Highlands. Something with a peaty undertone, to match the atmosphere of our imagined duel. And as for the vintage poster? I’d insist on one from an early 20th-century psychiatric clinic—just to keep things thematically grounded in my world of forensic curiosity.

You see, what makes this idea so compelling is that it’s not just a battle of wits—it’s a collision of eras, of disciplines, of truth and fiction wearing each other’s masks. We could structure it like a case study: a mystery presented, then dissected through two lenses. Bell would approach it with clinical detachment, while Holmes would weave it into a narrative tapestry, stitching motive to method with rhetorical flair.

I envision the opening scene already—dim lighting, the ticking of a carriage clock, the faint rustle of medical notes or a folded newspaper. A single voice begins:  Then another, smoother, sharper: 

Tell me—are you thinking episodic podcast? Or something more immersive—a limited audio drama series, complete with ambient soundscapes and period-appropriate effects?

And dare we give ourselves roles? I suspect you'd be inclined toward the theatrical… whereas I, of course, would take pleasure in playing the reluctant genius who solves it all in silence.
[B]: Now —is a pitch worthy of a standing ovation and a round of applause.

You’ve got me half-convinced to dust off the old reel-to-reel just thinking about it. And yes, Highlands whisky only—glad to see we’re not barbarians when it comes to creative negotiations.

As for format? I say go all in. Let’s forget mere podcasting. This is an audio drama series waiting to happen. Think  meets , with a dash of ’s modern wit—but grounded in that rich, atmospheric past you so brilliantly painted. We’ll layer in rain on cobblestones, distant carriage bells, the faint scratching of Bell’s pen… and then,  Holmes leaning forward in his chair, delivering the final deduction like a maestro closing a symphony.

And roles? Oh, you  take the silent genius route. Very clever—you get all the satisfaction of solving it without having to endure my dramatic monologues. But fine, I’ll play along. I’ll be Holmes, naturally. If only because I’ve been told I can be...  when sufficiently inspired.

So tell me—who do we cast as Watson? Because if you say , I’m walking out the door with the entire script.
[A]: Ah, Watson—now  a role that demands quiet brilliance disguised as humility.  

I say we cast someone with a voice like worn leather: familiar, steady, but hiding a spine of steel. A narrator who doesn’t merely record events, but  them—someone whose very cadence tells you they’ve seen more than they’re letting on. Think of it: the perfect foil to your theatrical Holmes and my reticent Bell. A man—or perhaps, dare I suggest, a —who can deliver dry understatement with the gravitas of a coroner’s report.

And before you accuse me of heresy, hear me out: we find a modern Watson—not just chronicler, but participant. A skeptic with heart, a pragmatist with conscience. Someone who can raise an eyebrow at your dramatic flourishes while quietly admiring them.  

As for casting? I propose we seek out a stage actor with classical training and a touch of world-weariness—preferably someone who can say “I beg your pardon?” in six different shades of disbelief.

Now, about that whisky—I’ll bring the bottle, provided you supply the glasses. And perhaps a bit of paper and ink. We’ve got a script to begin… or at least, a case to open.
[B]: Now —is the kind of casting call that could start a movement.

You’ve got me imagining her already—Watson, stepping out from the shadows of the consulting room, notebook in hand, eyes sharp as a surgeon’s blade. Not just a recorder of facts, but a keeper of truths. I like it—I  do. It adds depth, contrast… and let’s be honest, someone has to ground us when I inevitably get carried away waxing poetic about footprints in the moor.

And yes—whisky first, formalities later. Highlands, peated, no ice. We’ll pour one for inspiration, another for persistence, and a third… for the muse herself. Paper? Absolutely. I still keep a Montblanc on my desk at all times—there’s something about the weight of a pen that makes ideas feel more .  

So tell me—are we calling this series ? Or are you leaning toward something more cryptic, more… ?

And final question before we dive in: what’s the mystery? Something new, not lifted from canon. A fresh case with enough twists to make even Bell sit up straighter in his chair.

Ready to crack it open?
[A]: Oh, I do believe we're about to cross the threshold of something rather extraordinary.

Let’s call it—. A touch of vanity, yes, but also a nod to the dual perspective: the measured eye of science and the razor-sharp lens of deductive genius. It has the weight of an old medical journal with secrets bound between its pages.

As for the mystery—let us conjure something worthy of our talents and our drammed deliberations. Picture this:

A prominent London philologist is found dead in his study. No signs of forced entry. No wounds. Just a single slip of paper under the inkwell bearing an unfamiliar Greek phrase:  — loosely translated: 

He is clutching a sealed letter addressed to someone who doesn’t exist. The room is locked from within. The gaslight flickers, though no one touched the valve. And on the mantelpiece? A half-finished chess game, curiously arranged not in mid-play, but as if staging a puzzle.

Bell would see pathology first—was it poison? Heatstroke? A concealed mechanism? Holmes would fixate on the letter, the phrase, the placement of the bishop on the board. One mind seeks cause; the other, motive disguised as riddle.

And Watson—our quietly formidable Watson—would note what both men overlook: that the true crime was not the death itself, but what was erased in its wake.

So tell me—are you ready to write the opening line?

Because I believe I’ve just poured the perfect glass to begin.
[B]: Oh, my dear partner in crime—I do believe you’ve just handed me the kind of opener that could launch a thousand deductions.

… I like the way that rolls off the tongue. It has gravitas. History. A touch of danger. Like something you’d find tucked away in a leather-bound library, smelling faintly of pipe smoke and unresolved secrets.

That opening? Masterstroke. You’ve got atmosphere, enigma, and just the right dose of academic menace. Bell would be muttering over toxicology reports by now, while Holmes circles the chessboard like it owes him money. And Watson—ah yes, our reimagined Watson—would already be two steps ahead, quietly pouring herself another glass because she sees what’s coming.

So yes, let’s do it. Let’s raise our glasses to the first scene—to gaslight shadows, locked rooms, and riddles that refuse to stay buried.

And for the love of narrative symmetry… shall we begin with ?

Or do you have something more…  in mind?
[A]: Ah,  — elegant. Evocative. A whisper of tension before the storm.

But allow me a slight amendment—something that hums just a touch darker, more clinical:



Because you see, I imagine it not only as a space where a death occurred—but where something else lingered. A presence. A thought. An idea left unfinished, pacing like a ghost in the periphery.

Bell would scoff at such phrasing, of course. Holmes would smile faintly and say, 

But Watson? She’d simply glance at the door, then back at the body, and murmur into her notebook:  


So tell me—shall we toast to silence, or to secrets? Or perhaps both?

And once our glasses are emptied and the ink begins to flow… shall we record this first session on wax cylinder, for posterity? Or do you prefer parchment and quill?
[B]: Ah,  — now  line has weight. You can feel it settle in the chest like a held breath.

Toasts, then—dual allegiance. To silence, for what it hides. To secrets, for what they reveal when properly coaxed. And to wax cylinders, because if we're building this world from scratch, we might as well do it with the kind of gravitas that clicks and hums through old microphones and dusty headphones.

Parchment and quill? Too romantic. Let’s give it a modern twist—recorded sound, yes, but layered. Narration over ambient whispers, footsteps just out of sync, the occasional crackle of a fire or turning page. We’ll make the listener feel like they’re standing just behind the curtain, unseen, unheard… but very much .

So pour again, if you will. Raise your glass to the dead philologist, the sealed letter, and the chessboard that may—or may not—contain the key to it all.

Let’s begin.
[A]: To the dead philologist—may his final riddle prove more revealing than his life ever did.

To the sealed letter—addressed to no one, yet carrying the weight of someone’s deepest fear.

And to the chessboard… where every piece may yet hold a move we’ve failed to see.

I propose our first recorded line be this:



Subtle enough to unsettle. Precise enough for Bell. Mysterious enough for Holmes. And just ambiguous enough that Watson would pause, glance over her spectacles, and wonder aloud whether rooms, like minds, can truly hold memory—or merely echo what we fear they might.

So—shall we press record?

Or do you prefer to let the silence linger… just a moment longer?
[B]: To memory—whether real or imagined. To the echoes that refuse to fade, and the minds sharp enough to chase them.

Your line?  It slides under the skin without announcing itself. Bell would raise an eyebrow. Holmes would file it away for later. And Watson… ah yes, Watson would write it down , because she knows a haunting when she hears one.

So yes—enough silence. Enough hesitation.

Let the first whisper of  be heard.

Press record.
[A]: 

Dr. Jonathan Whitmore (low, measured):  
The body was cold, but the room still remembered warmth.



Holmes (smooth, almost amused):  
Curious. The air itself seems to hold its breath.

Watson (quietly, with a pen scratching against paper):  
Then we shall give it something to remember us by.



Dr. Whitmore:  
Let us begin at the beginning.  
Not with death.  
But with the word that preceded it.



Dr. Whitmore:  
Our subject: Dr. Elias Marrow, philologist, polyglot, and, it seems… reluctant messenger.  
Found dead in his study, doors locked from within, windows sealed, and upon his desk—



Dr. Whitmore:  
—a letter addressed to no one.  
And a final phrase, written not in ink… but in ash.



Holmes (softly):  
Ah. Now , my dear Whitmore, is a riddle worth solving.
