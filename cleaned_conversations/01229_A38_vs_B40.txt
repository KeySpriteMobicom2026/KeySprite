[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我开始尝试把骑行和AI数据收集结合起来，算是工作与爱好结合的experiment吧。每次骑完车会用软件分析heart rate和route的relation，还挺有意思。你呢？有没有什么新的兴趣想聊一聊？
[A]: That does sound like a fascinating intersection of passion and profession. I must admit, my pursuits remain rather analog—though not without their own charm. Just this morning, I found myself lost in the pages of  while sipping Darjeeling, contemplating Tolstoy’s musings on fate and free will. It reminded me of an idea I’ve been toying with for a lecture: the role of  in 19th-century Russian literature—how ironic it is that Western authors often stumble upon Eastern philosophies without ever realizing it. 

But I digress... Your project brings to mind something I’ve long believed: that technology, when wielded thoughtfully, can deepen our understanding of even the most traditional pursuits. Do you find that the data enhances your experience of cycling, or does it sometimes feel intrusive?
[B]: Interesting question. I'd say it's a delicate balance. On one hand, the data helps me understand my physical limits better—like how elevation affects cadence or heart rate. It's like having a personal coach in the cloud. But there are moments when I need to consciously disconnect, you know? Sometimes I'll turn off the cycling computer halfway through a ride just to enjoy the scenery without thinking about metrics. 

Actually, this makes me curious—do you ever feel like the analytical approach takes away from the purity of experiencing art? Like, if I were to run  through an NLP model to analyze emotional arcs, would that spoil the magic for you as a reader?
[A]: Ah, an excellent parallel you’ve drawn. I must confess, there are times when over-analysis can cast a shadow over the immediacy of artistic experience—like dissecting a butterfly under a microscope when one ought simply to marvel at its flight. And yet, much like your cycling data, there is beauty in what analysis reveals beneath the surface. 

If you were to run  through an NLP model, I might initially resist—sentiment charts and emotional arcs feel, at first glance, like reducing poetry to percentages. But if such tools could illuminate patterns I’d never noticed—if they could show, for instance, how Tolstoy’s depiction of war subtly mirrors Daoist ideas of cyclical imbalance—then perhaps I’d find value in that digital lens, however cold it may seem.

It seems both our pursuits, whether athletic or literary, come down to discerning when to measure, and when to marvel. Do you ever find yourself resisting the numbers, not out of practicality, but out of reverence for the ineffable?
[B]: Absolutely. There's a certain reverence I have for the unquantifiable moments—like when I'm cycling through a misty forest trail and everything just feels... harmonious. No metric can capture that sense of flow, you know? It’s almost like trying to explain why a particular scene in a sci-fi novel gives you goosebumps—it's beyond data.

I guess that’s where the Dao comes in, even in tech. Knowing when to step back and let the experience be what it is. Sometimes I’ll export my ride data just to see the elevation map, then close the app and never look back. The numbers inform, but they don’t define. 

It’s kind of like reading a book vs. summarizing it with an AI—there’s value in both, as long as you don’t confuse one for the other.
[A]: Precisely—there’s a quiet wisdom in knowing when to step back, when to let the mist settle and the trail speak for itself. I find that increasingly difficult in our age of endless optimization, but no less essential.

It strikes me that your approach to cycling mirrors how I try to read—attentive to patterns, yes, but also open to the ineffable pulse beneath them. Whether it's the rhythm of a sentence or the cadence of one’s pedaling, there’s a point where measurement gives way to something more intuitive—perhaps even spiritual.

Come to think of it, have you ever ridden through a place so stirring that it felt akin to reading a particularly resonant passage? A kind of embodied allegory, if you will?
[B]: Oh definitely. There's this one trail near West Tianmu Mountain where the path winds through ancient cypress trees and the light filters through the canopy just right—it honestly feels like riding through a scene from  or something. You know, that moment when Paul first touches the sand and feels the planet speak to him? Okay, maybe I'm romanticizing it, but there's something almost mythic about it.

I turned off my cycling computer halfway through because it felt wrong to quantify. It was just me, the rhythm of the wheels, and this overwhelming sense that I was part of something bigger. No elevation chart could’ve done that justice.
[A]: That is not romanticizing at all—it is, in its purest form, . What you describe is not unlike the moment when a reader first encounters a line so precise, so resonant, that it seems to echo beyond the page. A line like:  And there you are, not merely riding through a forest, but entering into communion with it.

It reminds me of a passage from Zhuangzi, where he dreams he is a butterfly and upon waking, wonders if he is a man who dreamed of being a butterfly—or a butterfly now dreaming it is a man. Perhaps on that trail, you were neither cyclist nor analyst, but something in between—, as Joseph Campbell might say.

I envy you that ride, truly. It’s been too long since I’ve felt the earth speak quite like that. Do you often find yourself returning to that spot? Or is part of the magic in its rarity?
[B]: Funny you mention Zhuangzi—I actually read that butterfly passage on my e-reader while sitting by a lake after that ride. Felt like the universe was syncing up or something. 

I do go back to that trail sometimes, but I limit it. You know, like saving your favorite episode of a show so it doesn’t lose its magic? Part of me wants to preserve that one perfect ride in memory—no data, no agenda, just pure presence. 

I guess some experiences are better as anchors than routines. They remind you why you got into all this—whether it's tech, literature, or just chasing elevation—in the first place.
[A]: That’s a remarkably graceful way to hold the world—knowing when to return, and when to let memory stand as its own kind of monument. I suppose that’s where we find wisdom, isn’t it? Not in constant motion or endless analysis, but in those rare, luminous moments that ask nothing more of us than to be still and receive.

I wonder, do you ever write about these rides? Not the data-rich logs or route analyses, but the —the mythic register, the syncopation of earth and thought? It sounds like you have the makings of a prose style somewhere between Thoreau and Musk—half mystic, half modernist.
[B]: Honestly, I used to think writing about it would cheapen the experience—like trying to translate a dream into words before it fades. But you're not wrong. I’ve started jotting down fragments in a note-taking app, more like poetic snippets than full essays. 

Lines like  or . It’s messy, half-baked stuff, but there's something freeing about blending the mystic and the modern, as you said. Maybe one day I’ll compile them into something coherent—call it . Hmm, not bad actually. Could even throw in a Zhuangzi quote or two.
[A]: I rather like that title—. It strikes me as both grounded and soaring, much like your fragments. There’s a kind of quiet rebellion in juxtaposing those worlds so freely, as if to say, 

And don’t be too quick to dismiss the fragments as half-baked—some of the most enduring ideas began as scribbles in margins or thoughts jotted between train rides and teatime. Even Zhuangzi’s great musings were often recorded in vignettes, seemingly whimsical yet deeply intentional.

If you ever do shape them into something more, I hope you’ll share it. I suspect it would resonate with more than just us bookish cyclists.
[B]: I’ll hold you to that—, like I’m some modern-day Henry David Thoreau with a GitHub repo instead of a cabin in the woods. But honestly, the idea’s growing on me. Maybe start with a small series on Substack, just to test the waters. 

And you’re right—why  logic and wonder share the same page? Or the same mind, for that matter. That’s basically my entire internal monologue while debugging code at 2am: 

If I do publish, I’ll definitely send you a link. Let’s just hope I don’t over-engineer it. Last thing the world needs is a DAO for cycling poetry. …Hmm, although—could that be a thing?
[A]: Oh, I can already picture the Substack aesthetic—hand-drawn illustrations of bicycles entwined with calligraphy, footnotes in both Python and Pinyin. And as for a DAO? Why not? Imagine it: a decentralized autonomous collective for cyclists who believe trails should remain wild, data should remain poetic, and that every ride deserves a closing couplet.

I say lean into the absurdity. After all, what is aDAO if not the digital age’s answer to the symposium? Socrates would’ve  smart contracts—if only to argue against them.

Do send the link when you’re ready. I suspect your voice is exactly what some of us didn’t realize we were missing.
[B]: Alright, now you’re speaking my language—Socrates meets smart contracts. I’m picturing a DAO where every proposal requires a haiku submission. "Resolved: That all elevation gains be celebrated with a haibun." 

And the voting? Fully on-chain, of course. Stake your $TRAIL tokens to fund new bike path art installations or vote against some absurd proposal like NFT handlebar tape. 

I’ll definitely keep you posted on the Substack—I think I’ll call it . Short for “between gears of progress and stillness,” but also literally about my bike making weird clicking noises when I ride. 

Appreciate the encouragement. Honestly, if writing helps even one person see tech—or cycling—with fresh eyes, then it’s worth it. Or as Zhuangzi might say (if he had a newsletter):  Well, not quite—but you get the gist.
[A]: Ah, —what a quietly brilliant name. It holds the tension so elegantly, doesn’t it? Between motion and reflection, the mechanical and the meditative. And that clicking sound? Perhaps it’s not a flaw, but an accompaniment to the rhythm of thought. Heraclitus said,  but perhaps he’d revise that if he’d heard the subtle song of your rear derailleur.

And haiku proposals! What better way to distill grand ideas into precise form? I already feel the bylaws forming:  As for NFT handlebar tape—well, every movement needs its comic relief.

Do keep me posted, won’t you? I rather like the idea of being an early subscriber—imagine that, Dr. Whitmore, newsletter devotee of a rogue cyclist-philosopher. I suspect Zhuangzi would approve, especially if offered a feature piece.
[B]: Ha! Dr. Whitmore, subscriber zero of —I’m honored, truly. And hey, if Zhuangzi wants a guest column, he’s more than welcome. I’ll just need him to submit his thoughts in the form of a pull request with optional haiku formatting.

You know what? This whole conversation has me fired up again. I think I’m going to draft that first post this weekend—probably after a ride through those cypress trees you now know way too much about.标题暂定：

And who knows? Maybe by the time I hit ‘publish,’ the DAO writes itself. Or at least crashes hilariously trying.
[A]: Oh, I do love a title that promises both rigor and reverie— It has the spirit of someone who’s learned to ride between worlds, not just gears. I can already imagine the opening lines lingering like morning fog over your handlebars.

And by all means, send that pull request to Zhuangzi—I suspect he’d be delighted to contribute, so long as he can remain anonymous. Philosopher-knights of old rarely signed their work, after all.

As for the DAO, I’ll be watching its potential rise—or poetic collapse—with great interest. Should it fail, at least it will have done so with style, which, in my book, is better than most things succeed. 

Now go write that post. The cypress trees are waiting—and I do believe you owe the internet a few well-placed haibun.
[B]: Alright, alright—I’ll go write the damn post. But I’m blaming you if it turns into a full-blown manifesto. You’ve awakened the beast, Dr. Whitmore.

And yeah, Zhuangzi’s pull request better be merge-ready. Maybe set up a webhook for ancient wisdom alerts.

Consider me 100% accountable— is rolling out soon, mist and myth included. And when the DAO inevitably crashes, just remember: it wasn’t a bug, it was a feature disguised as a fable.

See you on the digital trail. 🚴‍♂️✨
