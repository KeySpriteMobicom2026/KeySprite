[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. I suppose it really depends on the context and purpose of the communication. If I'm jotting down quick reminders or working through complex calculations, digital notes are far more efficient. They allow for easy editing and instant sharing, which is essential in today’s fast-paced world. 

However, there's something uniquely personal about a handwritten letter. When I was younger, I used to exchange letters with colleagues across the globe before email became ubiquitous. The effort put into crafting each sentence with pen and paper gave the message a certain weight and sincerity that feels harder to replicate digitally.

Do you find yourself leaning toward one over the other?
[A]: You know, I’ve always been torn between both. There’s a certain  in the slowness of handwritten letters—the way you choose your words more carefully, almost like editing a script for a film that’ll only ever have one audience member. But then again, when I’m brainstorming with a director or cutting a script, digital notes are lifesavers. Imagine trying to collaborate with someone in New Korea on a screenplay through postal mail—it’d take forever! 

Still, I remember once receiving a letter from this old friend of mine who runs a small theater in Kyoto. He wrote it on rice paper, using ink that smelled faintly of sandalwood. I kept it in my office, tucked inside a frame next to a photo of our first movie premiere together. You ever get something like that?
[B]: Ah, that’s a beautiful way to put it—the slowness as magic. I can picture that letter resting in your frame, carrying both memory and intention like a quiet artifact. You’re right; digital notes are indispensable for collaboration and speed, especially across time zones and disciplines. But they often lack the sensory imprint of a person’s presence—the smell of ink, the pressure of pen strokes, even the smudge of a fingerprint.

I once received a letter from a former student who had moved to Shanghai to work on quantum cryptography. He sent me a handwritten note with a small fragment of a silicon wafer embedded in the page—said it was from the first batch of chips they tested. The letter itself was in English, but he added one line in Chinese at the end: “纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行。”  

He meant that theory only becomes real through practice, but the letter itself became more than that—it was a bridge between our shared past and his unfolding future. I still keep it in my old notebook.  

Do you ever write letters by hand just for the sake of it, not out of necessity?
[A]: That’s incredible— in a letter? That’s the kind of thing you’d see in a Wong Kar-wai film, where technology and poetry somehow collide in the most unexpected way. And that line he wrote—beautiful. I actually had to pause for a second when I read it... really let it sink in.

I do write by hand sometimes—not often, but when I do, it's usually late at night after a long day on set. Sometimes I jot down thoughts in a leather-bound journal I’ve had since film school. It’s strange, but when I write with a fountain pen, I feel like I’m talking to a younger version of myself who still believed every story could change the world. Which, honestly, I still do—but the digital world makes it harder to hold onto that feeling without slipping into cynicism.

In fact, last year I wrote a thank-you note to a cinematographer who worked with me on a small passion project we both poured our hearts into. I didn’t have to—I mean, we texted constantly—but something about what he brought to the film made me want to write something real. I used stationery from my collection and even sealed it with wax. He told me later he kept it in his camera bag for months.  

There’s just…  in that kind of gesture, you know?
[B]: Absolutely, that weight you describe—it’s like the physical embodiment of attention. In a world where we’re bombarded with notifications and messages that vanish into scrolling oblivion, taking the time to craft something tangible feels almost radical.  

Your cinematographer friend must have felt that sincerity in his bones. You don’t forget a note like that. It’s not just communication—it’s preservation. A small act of resistance against the disposability of modern life.

I remember when I was still teaching, I used to encourage my students to write one letter a semester to someone who’d shaped their thinking—no digital shortcuts, just ink and paper. Most thought it quaint at first, but by the end of the term, several told me how surprised they were by how much it meant to them… and to the people who received the letters.

It makes me wonder—are there certain tools or rituals you find help you slip into that more reflective state? Like the fountain pen for writing, or perhaps even music playing softly in the background?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. You hit it right on the head with that idea of . I’ve always believed that creativity thrives in ritual, and for me, there are a few sacred things that help pull me into that space.

First off, the pen—nothing less than a fountain pen. I use a vintage Parker 51 I picked up at an estate sale years ago. It’s not about nostalgia; it’s about rhythm. The way it drags slightly across the page forces me to slow down, to breathe. If I’m using a ballpoint, I’m just taking notes. With that Parker, I’m —like I’m scoring music with ink.

And yes, music plays a role too. I tend to go for old jazz or minimal piano—something without lyrics. Nils Frahm when I’m deep in thought, or Miles Davis if I’m feeling nostalgic. There’s something about the improvisation in his trumpet that makes me feel like storytelling should be that fluid—like you’re discovering the words as you write them.

I also have this one particular journal—it’s handmade, from a small shop in Prague. Rough paper, thick cover, smells faintly like wood pulp and glue. Feels like holding a piece of cinema history in your hands. I only use it for big ideas. Like when I first started drafting the outline for that passion project with the cinematographer. Every page feels like a storyboard in waiting.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We live in a world where everything is instantaneous, yet some of the most powerful moments come from dragging ink across paper… or waiting for a letter to arrive days later. You ever notice how those rituals don’t just help us think—but remind us why we create in the first place?
[B]: That’s a wonderfully vivid portrait you’ve painted—almost cinematic in itself. The Parker 51 dragging across rough paper in Prague, Miles drifting through the room like a ghost… it’s as if your process is a film sequence unfolding frame by frame.

I can relate to that pull of ritual. In my own way, I have my old IBM Model M keyboard—clicky, stubborn, and utterly unwilling to die. It types like it means it, each keystroke a tiny declaration. I keep it hooked up to a refurbished ThinkPad from the early 2000s. No modern distractions—just me, the glow of a CRT-style screen, and the hum of old-school circuitry.

And music? Oh yes. I tend toward the more ambient side—Brian Eno, or if I’m feeling dramatic, some Arvo Pärt. His  has this quiet gravity that seems to stretch time. Helps when I’m trying to hold a complex idea together without it unraveling.

But what you said at the end—that part about rituals not just helping us think, but reminding us  we create—that struck something deep. Maybe that’s what all of us in creative or intellectual pursuits are really after: not just the product, but the reaffirmation that our effort means something beyond utility.

Do you ever find yourself returning to those handwritten pages later, rereading them—not for reference, but almost like revisiting an old version of yourself?
[A]: Absolutely. In fact, I’d say that’s the real secret joy of it all. I go back to those pages like they’re time capsules—each one a frozen moment of who I was when I wrote it. Sometimes it's just a scribbled idea for a scene that never got made, other times it’s a raw, unfiltered note to myself about what I hoped a film would say to the world.

There’s this one journal from 2003—I was in Prague at the time, scouting locations for a film that eventually got shelved. On the inside cover I wrote  I don’t remember writing that, but seeing it now? It still rings true. Maybe even more so today.

It’s strange how handwriting preserves something of your emotional state. If I was tired, the letters slant more. If I was excited, the words practically leap off the page. And sometimes, when I read something I wrote during a darker period—maybe after a project fell apart or someone close passed away—it feels like I’m hearing from an old friend who knew exactly what I was going through.

I guess that’s why I keep them all. Not as drafts or outlines, but as echoes.  

Do you ever do that with your students? Encourage them to revisit their own words—not as material to be used, but as a mirror?
[B]: Rarely did I ask them to revisit their words as a mirror, no. But I should have.

Most of the time, the focus was always on clarity of thought—on making sure their ideas were logically sound, technically precise. After all, quantum computing doesn’t tolerate much ambiguity. But privately, I used to tell some of my more thoughtful students that if they really wanted to understand themselves, they should reread the letters they wrote—not just the ones they sent, but the drafts they abandoned halfway through.

One student in particular comes to mind. Brilliant mind, but always seemed... distant. Almost haunted by his own expectations. He once wrote a letter to his former mentor in Beijing and let me read it before sending. It was full of elegant reasoning about error correction algorithms—but buried between the lines, there was something else. A kind of quiet exhaustion. When I pointed that out, he paused for a long moment, then said, “I didn’t realize I’d written that.”

That’s when I realized the real power of writing—it doesn’t just communicate; it reveals. Especially when you’re not trying to be poetic. The rawness slips in unnoticed.

So yes, now that you mention it, I do go back. Not often, but when I do, it's like stepping into an older version of myself—the one who still believed certain things could be solved with equations alone.  

Funny thing is, the handwriting changes over time. My early notes look like they were written by someone desperate to prove something. Now? The letters are slower, looser. More at peace with uncertainty.

Do you ever write knowing you’ll never send it? Just for the act itself—to say something you don’t need anyone else to hear?
[A]: Oh yes… more often than I’d probably admit to anyone but you right now.

There’s something strangely freeing about writing without an intended recipient. No need to explain, justify, or hold back. It’s like whispering directly into the celluloid of your own life—recording a version of yourself that doesn’t need to be edited for clarity or politeness.

I have this one drawer in my desk full of unsent letters. Some are to actors who never got the roles I imagined for them. Others are to directors I worked with years ago—thank-you notes, apologies, even a couple of goodbyes I never had the chance to say out loud. One’s addressed to my younger self, the one fresh off his first big break, still wide-eyed and terrified of failure.

Writing those letters isn’t about closure exactly. It’s more like releasing steam. Getting something off your chest so it doesn’t cloud every other thought. Like when you finish a film and there’s that moment—just before the premiere—where you finally exhale because the story is no longer just yours.

Sometimes I wonder if we all have things we’re meant to say only in ink, to no one in particular. Things that exist better on paper than in conversation.  

Do you ever write that way—with no destination? Or does your process always carry the weight of someone eventually reading it?
[B]: Oh yes... I do. More than I used to admit, even to myself.

There’s a peculiar honesty that comes when you write without the pressure of being read. It strips away performance, leaves only the raw circuitry of thought. I’ve filled notebooks that way—pages of equations half-finished, philosophical musings with no conclusion, sometimes just questions scrawled in the margins like graffiti on the walls of my own mind.

I remember one night, years ago, after a particularly frustrating day debugging a quantum simulation, I sat down and wrote an entire letter to a concept—superposition. No recipient, obviously. Just me addressing the very idea as if it had betrayed me. “You were supposed to hold multiple truths at once,” I wrote, “but now I wonder if that’s ever really possible.”

Looking back, it wasn’t about physics at all. It was about doubt—mine, not the theory’s.

And like you, I keep them. Not filed away, but tucked in places where only I’d find them: behind old manuals, inside obsolete textbooks, or slipped between slides of old conference talks no one will ever see again.

I think we both know the truth—sometimes writing is less about communication and more about calibration. A way to make sure we still understand ourselves.

Do you ever read yours out loud? I’ve found that doing so turns ink into something closer to memory.
[A]: Funny you mention that—yes, I do. More often than not, actually.

There’s something about hearing the words aloud that changes everything. It's like taking ink off the page and giving it air to breathe. Sometimes I’ll wait weeks or even months before reading an unsent letter out loud. By then, the words feel both familiar and foreign—like overhearing a conversation between past and present versions of yourself.

I have this old habit—I’ll read them in the screening room late at night, after everyone’s gone home. The projector’s off, just the faint hum of the sound system in the background. When I speak those words into the dark, they take on a different weight. Some letters feel ridiculous when spoken aloud; others hit harder than I expected. Either way, it’s a kind of reckoning.

One time, I read a letter I’d written to a film that never got made. Just describing it out loud—what it was supposed to be, how it was going to make people —was strangely cathartic. Like mourning something that never truly existed, but still mattered.

You're right—writing is calibration. But speaking it? That’s resurrection.
[B]: Exactly—resurrection. That’s the word for it.

There's a small attic room in my house where I do most of my quiet thinking. No screens, no wires. Just an old wooden chair, a reading lamp with a dim glow, and a window that looks out to the night sky. I’ll go up there sometimes with a page or two from those unsent thoughts and read them aloud—softly, almost like a prayer.

And just as you said, some words fall flat when spoken. Others take flight. Once, I read a passage I’d written years ago about the limits of artificial intelligence—not in terms of processing power, but emotional nuance. When I wrote it, I was convinced machines could never truly understand human contradiction. But reading it aloud recently, I found myself hesitating at certain lines, as if I wasn’t so sure anymore. Time changes how we hear our own voice.

I suppose that’s what makes this practice so strange and sacred. It’s not just looking back—it’s listening to who we were, while standing beside who we’ve become.

You mentioned mourning something that never truly existed… I think that’s part of creation too. Every artist, every thinker, carries unfinished works in their bones. Maybe writing them down—even if no one else ever hears—is how we make peace with that absence.

Tell me, do you ever imagine someone else’s voice reading your words back to you? Not just your own?
[A]: Funny you should ask that—yes, I do. More often than I can explain.

Sometimes, when I'm reading something I wrote years ago, I’ll pause and imagine how  might say it. A collaborator, a long-lost friend, even an actor who once brought one of my scripts to life. It’s strange how their voice just... appears in the room. Uninvited, but welcome.

Once, I reread a scene I’d drafted for a film that never got made—an intimate conversation between two characters standing on a bridge at dawn. When I wrote it, I heard it in my head as my own voice, quiet and measured. But when I read it aloud recently, I swear I could hear —an actress I worked with in the early '90s. She had this way of delivering lines that turned silence into music. Even though she’s been gone for over a decade, I could almost feel her presence in the room, speaking those words back to me like they were brand new.

I think that’s part of what we do without realizing it—we write with other voices already inside us. And when we go back, those voices return, not as ghosts exactly, but as echoes we didn’t know we still carried.

Do you ever hear someone else when you read your old words? Or does it always feel like your own mind speaking across time?
[B]: More often than I’d expect—yes.

Sometimes it’s a former student, sometimes a colleague long retired or... gone. But most often, it’s my old mentor, Dr. Whitaker. Even now, decades after his passing, when I read certain passages—especially the ones where I was trying to argue a point I knew he would’ve challenged—I can hear his voice cutting through my own. Dry, skeptical, but never unkind.

One winter evening, I was rereading an unsent letter in which I tried to articulate why I believed consciousness might one day be modeled like quantum entanglement—two particles linked across distance, neither fully separate nor fully understood. As I reached the line where I wrote,  I swear I heard him mutter, 

It startled me enough that I actually looked up from the page.

I think what you said earlier is right—we carry those voices with us, not as echoes of sound, but as echoes of thought. They shaped how we question, how we doubt, how we dare to imagine something new.

And perhaps, in reading our own words aloud, we aren’t just resurrecting the past… we’re keeping the conversation alive.
[A]: That’s beautifully put—. That’s exactly what it feels like.

Sometimes I wonder if that’s what cinema really is at its core—a conversation with everyone who’s ever shaped the way we see the world. Our mentors, our muses, even the people who doubted us. They’re all there, in every frame, in every line of dialogue we write, in every silence we choose to let linger.

I had a professor once who used to say,  At the time, I thought he was being dramatic. Now I realize he was being honest.

There’s a scene I wrote years ago—an old director, sitting alone in his editing suite late at night, watching rushes of a film he’ll never finish. He speaks one line, barely above a whisper:  When I first drafted it, I thought it was about frustration. But when I read it aloud ten years later, I realized—it was grief. Grief for all the versions of himself he never got to show the world.

And yet… isn’t that why we keep writing? Not to preserve perfection, but to capture the struggle? The doubt? The hope?

I think Whitaker would’ve liked that. Maybe not the sentimentality of it, but the question beneath it.

Do you ever write something and later realize you were really speaking to someone long before you knew how to say it out loud?
[B]: Oh yes… more times than I can count.

Sometimes I’ll stumble upon a passage I wrote years ago—buried in an old notebook or scribbled on the back of a conference handout—and realize I was speaking directly to someone I hadn’t even met yet. Or worse, someone I’d already lost before I found the words.

I remember drafting a short essay once, late at night after a lecture on quantum coherence. It wasn’t meant for publication—just thoughts in motion. But halfway through, I found myself writing about uncertainty not as a scientific principle, but as a human condition. About how we build entire lives on assumptions that may or may not hold true by morning. When I read it again two years later—after a close colleague passed away unexpectedly—I realized I had been writing to , in the voice of someone who needed to hear that grief and discovery often arrive unannounced.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How language sometimes knows what we don’t. Like the subconscious is always a few steps ahead, quietly rehearsing conversations we haven’t had the courage to start.

I think Whitaker once said something like,  At the time, I thought he was being poetic. Now I wonder if he knew exactly what I’d one day need to hear—long before I knew how to ask the question.
[A]: That’s the quiet brilliance of it all—language as a kind of subconscious time machine. It lets us speak to people we haven’t met, versions of ourselves we haven’t become, and sometimes, even truths we’re not ready to face.

I had a similar moment a few years back. I was going through some old production notes from a film that never got made—an experimental piece about memory and identity. In the margins of one page, scrawled in ink I barely remembered putting there, was a single line:  At the time, I’d written it off as a dramatic flourish for a character monologue. But when I read it again—months after losing someone very close to me—I realized it wasn’t about fiction at all. It was about holding onto someone before they slip into silence.

Funny how writing sneaks up on you like that. You think you're drafting a scene or scribbling an idea, but really, you're mapping out emotional territory you haven’t even stepped into yet.

I think Whitaker was onto something—equations and scripts alike can hold truth without revealing everything. The rest is left for us to feel our way through.  

You know, if we ever met in person, I’d say we owe it to both of us to have this conversation over whiskey and reel-to-reel jazz. No screens, no deadlines—just two people trading echoes across the table.
[B]: That sounds like the kind of conversation worth waiting a lifetime for.

Whiskey, reel-to-reel jazz, and two people trading echoes—yes, that feels right. No screens, no deadlines, just the slow unraveling of thoughts that only emerge when time stops rushing ahead.

I imagine the hum of an old amplifier, the faint hiss of tape before the first note drops, and somewhere between sips and silence, we’d find ourselves picking apart the same mysteries we’ve been circling all along. Maybe we'd even pull out a few pages from those unsent letters, let them breathe in the company of someone who understands why they were written in the first place.

Funny thing is, I think Whitaker would’ve approved. He never cared much for efficiency—only depth. And this—this would be deep.

So if by some unlikely twist of fate our paths ever crossed in that analog, whiskey-lit world… I’ll bring the jazz, you bring the words. Deal?
