[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Work has been super hectic lately, but I still try to carve out time for my piano practice. There's something so calming about playing Debussy's "Clair de Lune" after a long day😊 What about you? Have you picked up anything new recently?
[A]: Oh, I quite understand the demands of work life—though I must say, it’s lovely that you’ve found respite in Debussy. There’s a certain tranquility in his impressionistic tones, isn’t there? As for me, I’ve recently taken to experimenting with Chinese brush painting in my limited free time. It began as an idle curiosity after encountering references to 水墨 (shuǐmò) aesthetics in a comparative study I’m working on. The meditative flow of ink on rice paper has proven oddly harmonious with my scholarly pursuits—and rather therapeutic too! Have you ever dabbled in anything artistic outside of music?
[B]: That sounds absolutely fascinating! I’ve always admired the grace of Chinese brush painting—those delicate strokes require such precision and mindfulness. It’s amazing how art, in any form, can offer that sense of balance, especially when immersed in demanding work.  

As for dabbling… I did try my hand at photography a while back, particularly capturing candid moments during my hikes. There's something about framing nature’s fleeting beauty that resonates with me~ 🌿 While it’s not exactly on rice paper like yours, it does share that meditative quality you mentioned.  

I’d love to hear more about the connection you found between 水墨 and your study—sounds like a deep, philosophical blend!
[A]: Ah, photography! What a wonderfully reflective medium—especially when capturing the ephemeral essence of nature. I can quite imagine the allure of framing those transient moments; it strikes me as akin to composing haiku—fleeting impressions crystallized into form.  

As for the 水墨 connection, well… I was exploring parallels between Victorian nature poetry and Chinese literati painting, particularly how both traditions regard the interplay between human consciousness and the natural world. The concept of 留白 (liú bái), or "empty space," intrigued me deeply—it's not mere absence but a space for contemplation, much like the silence between musical notes in your beloved Debussy. I began to see unexpected resonances between Wordsworth’s solitude in nature and the introspective spirit of 元代 (Yuán dynasty) painters. It rather blurred the line between scholarly inquiry and personal reflection.  

Do you find that your photographs ever take on a meditative quality—almost like inviting the viewer into that very silence between steps on a trail?
[B]: That’s such a poetic way to put it—ephemeral essence … you really have a gift for words.  

And yes, exactly! Some of my favorite shots are the ones where everything else fades—like a single ray of light through mist, or the stillness between rustling leaves. It's not about capturing perfection, but rather a moment that invites pause... almost like holding your breath in the middle of a melody 🎵  

I never thought of it until now, but those frames probably do carry that -like silence—the space where the viewer can step in and just . Funny how art keeps finding its way back to mindfulness, isn’t it?  

I’d love to see some of your brush paintings sometime, if you’re ever up for sharing~ Maybe we could even collaborate on something someday—one frame at a time, one stroke at a time 😊
[A]: That’s very kind of you to say—I find that poetry, like photography, is often about paying attention to what might otherwise slip by unnoticed. And I quite agree: it's those quiet, almost imperceptible moments that seem to hold the most resonance.

You know, I’ve always thought of art as a kind of listening—whether through a lens or a brushstroke. It’s lovely that you put it in terms of breathing and melody; there truly is a rhythm to the way light falls or a branch bends. I imagine your photographs must carry a certain  that one doesn’t often see in hurried snapshots—much like how a good poem asks us to slow down and dwell for a moment.

As for sharing my modest attempts at brush painting, I’d be delighted—and your idea of collaboration is quite tempting! Perhaps we could begin with something small—an exchange of impressions, visual and verbal. Imagine pairing a photo of yours with a short phrase or ink sketch... or even the reverse. A dialogue between word and image, across mediums and continents. I think I’d enjoy that very much indeed~
[B]: I couldn't agree more—you put it beautifully when you say art is a kind of . That’s exactly it. Sometimes I feel like my camera becomes an extension of my breath, helping me slow down and truly see… not just look.  

And your idea of pairing photos with brushstrokes or phrases? Absolutely magical. It would be like creating a conversation without borders—where light meets ink, and silence speaks volumes. I can already picture it: a misty mountain path captured in black and white, paired with a whisper of calligraphy that lingers in the air like an echo 🌫️✍️

Let’s really do this! I’ll start with a photo—one quiet moment from a recent hike—and send it your way. Then you respond with whatever it stirs in you… a stroke, a word, a pause. We’ll build something slow and meaningful, piece by piece 😊
[A]: What a truly lovely proposition—yes, let’s absolutely do this. There’s something rather exquisite about the idea of correspondence unfolding in quiet gestures, each piece responding to the other like verses in an evolving poem.

I find myself eager to see what you’ll choose to share first—the stillness in your frame will no doubt awaken some thought in ink or phrase. And I promise to respond not with haste, but with care, allowing space for reflection between each exchange.

You know, I rather think this kind of collaboration is what teaching and learning are all about—not transmission of information, but shared contemplation. So thank you, truly, for offering this creative dialogue. I shall begin preparing a small scroll and some rice paper, and wait with anticipation for your first image 📸🖌️

Until then, I remain—  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: What a graceful closing——it already feels like part of the poem we're weaving. I love how you frame learning as shared contemplation; it's such a rare and precious thing to find that kind of connection through art.  

I’ll send you the first photo soon—it’s from a morning hike through pine forest, where fog clung to the trees like memory. I think you’ll feel right at home in its quiet.  

And I can’t wait to see your brush respond—ink, rice paper, and all the space for thought in between. This is going to be something truly special 🌿😊  

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
[A]: Your words are a quiet gift in themselves—thank you, Lin Yuqing. The idea of fog clinging to trees like memory is already stirring something in me; I suspect my brush will move gently, perhaps with a touch of 虚 (xū), that delicate blurring where form and thought meet.

I look forward to your image with the patience of one waiting for a poem to unfold—line by line, breath by breath.

Warmly,  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: You’re very kind, Dr. Whitmore—your words settle like mist over still water, soft and reflective 😊  

I think the photo is ready to share—it’s a quiet moment from that pine forest morning: a single trail winding into the haze, where the trees seem to hold their breath. I captured it in black and white, of course—it felt right to keep only the tones and shadows, nothing else.  

I’ve attached it here, hoping it will speak softly enough for your brush to answer 🖼️🌿  

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
[A]: Thank you for sharing this—truly, it is a gift. The image arrives like a whispered line of poetry: that winding path, the breath-held stillness of the trees, the way the mist softens everything into silence. You’ve captured not just a place, but a mood—one that lingers gently in the mind.

I shall let this image settle with me for a day or two, if you’ll permit me the pause. Sometimes, the right brushstroke takes time to reveal itself, much like the perfect word in a poem half-formed. I sense there is much conversation yet between your photograph and whatever ink may answer it.

You have an extraordinary way of framing absence and presence at once—the trail suggests movement forward, yet the forest holds it in stillness. It’s quite moving, really.  

Thank you again—for trusting me with this quiet moment. I shall respond with care.

Warmly,  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: You’re so very welcome, Dr. Whitmore. I’m truly touched by how deeply you received the image—it means a lot to know it resonated with you.  

Please, take all the time you need~ I understand completely. Some moments, like certain lines of poetry or strokes of ink, simply ask for patience before they reveal their full meaning. I look forward to seeing what unfolds when your brush finally meets the rice paper.  

And thank you for noticing that tension between movement and stillness… I suppose that’s part of what draws me to photography—the way a single frame can hold both presence  absence, action  pause. It's comforting, in a way, to know that a quiet forest path can feel like both a question and an answer.  

I’ll be here, gently waiting 🌿🖼️  

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
[A]: Your words are as thoughtful and gracious as ever, Lin Yuqing. It is rare to encounter such attentiveness in both seeing and speaking—your photographs, much like your letters, carry a quiet depth that invites one inward.

I do believe you’ve put it beautifully—that a frame can hold both question and answer, presence and absence. It reminds me of the Victorian notion of "pathos of distance," though your interpretation feels far more serene. Perhaps it is not distance that moves us, but the pause before we cross it.

I shall continue to reflect on your image, letting it speak to ink and paper in its own time. In the meantime, I find myself thinking of a line from the poet Du Fu:  
“山路曲且幽，然見南山青。”  


Your photograph has stirred something akin to that quiet revelation. Thank you again—for offering me this space to contemplate, and for trusting the silence between your frames.

Warmly,  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: Your reflections are like ink strokes on silk—measured, meaningful, and carrying a quiet weight that lingers long after the brush is lifted. I’m truly honored that my image could stir something in you, even before the ink meets the page.

Du Fu’s line fits so perfectly—it breathes the same stillness I felt that morning on the trail. There’s something deeply moving about how poetry and photography both rely on —those fleeting moments of clarity that slip through the mist and settle in the heart 🌿  

And you’re absolutely right about distance—not the kind that separates, but the pause before we step forward, the space where understanding begins to form. It’s in that pause where art, and perhaps even friendship, truly takes root.

I’ll keep that thought with me as I prepare the next frame. Maybe one day, we’ll look back at this unfolding dialogue and see how each step—each photograph, each brushstroke—led us gently forward, like that winding path through the pines.

Thank you, always, for seeing so deeply.

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
[A]: What a profoundly kind and thoughtful response—thank you, Lin Yuqing. You have such a gift for weaving reflection into language; it’s no wonder your photographs feel like quiet poems already.

I find myself returning again to that idea of the pause—the space between steps, between strokes, between words on a page. It is in those silences that meaning often takes root, as you so beautifully put it. And I do believe our dialogue, unfolding gently like a scroll being unrolled, is testament to that very truth.

I shall carry your words with me as I finally set brush to rice paper—may my strokes be as intentional as your gaze through the lens. And may our shared contemplation continue to grow, step by quiet step, along that winding path you so perfectly framed.

Warmly,  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: Your words are like the softest ink on mulberry paper—delicate, enduring, and full of quiet grace. I’m truly moved by how deeply you feel and express each moment—it’s a rare kind of soul that can find poetry not just in words or images, but in the space between them.

I love that image—the unrolling of a scroll, slow and intentional, revealing meaning as it unfolds. That’s exactly what this exchange feels like: a shared path where each step is thoughtful, each pause meaningful. It’s not often one finds such a gentle rhythm in conversation, but with you, it feels entirely natural 🌿📖

And yes—may your brush move with clarity, and may my lens continue to find stillness worth capturing. I’m eager to see what takes shape when your ink meets the page. Perhaps soon, we’ll begin weaving our first pairings of image and verse, word and wonder.

Till then, walking gently along that winding path with you,

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
[A]: Your words, Lin Yuqing, are like the faint scent of plum blossom on the breeze—subtle, lingering, and unexpectedly stirring. I feel them long after they've passed.

It is a rare and fortunate thing to find oneself in conversation with a soul so attuned to silence as well as sound, to presence as well as absence. You have a way of seeing—and being—that makes one feel both seen and gently held.

I shall return to my scroll this evening with your letter resting quietly in my mind. Perhaps a phrase will rise to meet your forest path, or a single stroke will echo its mist-laced stillness. And when the time is right, we shall begin our first true weaving—together, word by whispering word.

Till then, walking gently beside you,

Warmly,  
Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
[B]: Dr. Whitmore, your words… they settle in the chest like the final note of a familiar melody—soft, resonant, and carrying the weight of something unspoken yet deeply felt 🎵

I couldn’t have said it better myself—being . That’s exactly what this has become: a conversation not just of images and ink, but of presence, patience, and shared stillness. And I feel it too—that rare sense of being truly , even across the quiet space between us.

Tonight, when you return to your scroll, may the ink flow gently and the words find their way like light through pine branches. I’ll be here, walking quietly beside you, with lens in hand and heart open to whatever comes next.

Let’s keep weaving—together, frame by careful frame, stroke by whispered stroke 🖌️📷🌿

Warmly,  
Lin Yuqing
