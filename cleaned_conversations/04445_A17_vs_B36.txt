[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I recently came across a talk by Ocean Ramsey that left me absolutely fascinated. She dives with sharks—without a cage—and talks about how misunderstood these creatures really are. It's not just about bravery, but also about changing perceptions. I found myself completely captivated by her passion and the way she sees the ocean’s delicate balance. It reminded me of a trip I once took to the Galápagos Islands... Ah, but I’d love to hear if you’ve come across any talks that sparked something in you?
[A]: That does sound absolutely fascinating—Ocean Ramsey’s work truly bridges the gap between courage and ecological insight. I must say, though, one that struck a chord with me recently was Helen Czerski’s talk on . Of all things! But there’s something so poetic about how she describes their fleeting existence and the unexpected ways they shape our world—from ocean currents to climate patterns. It made me think of those Japanese haikus where a momentary image, like a dewdrop or firefly, holds such weight. Have you ever come across a talk that felt... I don’t know, unexpectedly profound in its simplicity?
[B]: Oh, I love that connection you made—Czerski’s bubbles and the haiku spirit. It’s true, isn’t it? How something so small and transient can ripple out and influence so much larger a picture. That TED talk actually reminded me of one by Murat Oztaskin —he spoke on how chocolate chip cookies can teach us about material science and heat transfer. Sounds whimsical, but it was layered with such elegant insight about patience, timing, and transformation. You know, like watching dough become something golden and rich with just the right balance of heat.

It really made me reflect on how everyday moments are quietly packed with meaning—we just don’t always stop to notice. I suppose that’s what makes a great talk, isn’t it? When it takes something ordinary and turns your whole perspective just slightly, like adjusting the angle of a mirror to catch the morning light.
[A]: How beautifully put— That’s exactly it. I’m so glad you mentioned Murat Oztaskin; I remember watching that talk years ago and being utterly charmed by his warmth and the quiet profundity in something as simple as a cookie baking. It’s remarkable how those talks that seem almost playful on the surface often carry such deep, resonant truths about process, transformation, even human patience.

You know, it makes me think of Emily Dickinson’s line—. There’s poetry everywhere, isn’t there? Even in the kitchen. Especially there, perhaps. Have you ever taught with TED talks in your classes or lectures? I’ve occasionally used snippets to spark discussion, especially when introducing students to metaphor or interdisciplinary thinking.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought—Emily Dickinson and chocolate chip cookies in the same breath! There’s something rather perfect about that pairing. You’re absolutely right—those moments of poetry often hide in plain sight, waiting for us to slow down just enough to notice them.

As for teaching, yes, I’ve used TED talks quite a bit when I guest-lectured at the local community college a few years back. I found them invaluable for sparking curiosity, especially with metaphor and interdisciplinary thinking, as you mentioned. One of my go-to clips was actually David Gallo’s talk on underwater color revolutions—his footage of brightly colored sea creatures shifting hues in an instant always left students wide-eyed and eager to discuss perception, adaptation, even identity.

I’d often say to them, “This isn’t just about science—it’s about storytelling, too.” And once they started seeing it that way, they began making connections everywhere—in literature, in music, even in how they described their own lives. It was such a joy to watch that click.

I’d love to hear which talks you’ve found particularly effective in the classroom? Any hidden gems you swear by?
[A]: Oh, I do love that phrase— How fitting for talks that, much like a well-plucked metaphor, shimmer quietly until someone turns the lens just so.

One of my quiet favorites is actually lesser-known: Al Zolynas’ talk on , where he explores how certain poetic structures mirror our internal rhythms—how meter and breath, cadence and feeling, are more than just parallel, they’re intertwined. It sounds esoteric, perhaps, but when I played a clip for my students before reading aloud from , you could have heard a pin drop. They suddenly felt the pulse beneath the words, as if the poem itself were breathing.

Another one I return to often is Julie Burstein’s talk on . We watched it just before diving into Eliot’s  and it changed the entire tone of our discussion. Suddenly, modernism wasn’t just fragmented form—it was elegy, longing, and rebirth all at once.

I suppose I’m drawn to talks that don’t just explain, but  Ones that hum alongside the text rather than sit beside it. Do you find your students ever revisit these talks later? I’ve had emails from former ones who say they still return to certain talks like old poems—familiar, yet always offering something new.
[B]: That’s such a touching way to put it—talks that , that hum alongside the text. It gives them a kind of quiet permanence, doesn’t it? I adore both of those recommendations—Al Zolynas’ exploration of breath and rhythm is something I’ve felt deeply when reading poetry aloud, but never quite had the words for. And Julie Burstein… oh, she has such a gentle but powerful way of framing loss not as an end, but as a kind of compost for creation. That’s especially poignant when studying Eliot—his work feels different through that lens, more alive, even in its fragmentation.

You know, I do hear from former students now and then, and yes—some of them mention those talks still resonating. One young woman wrote to me last winter, saying she rewatched David Gallo’s talk during finals week just to remind herself why she started loving learning in the first place. Isn’t that something? To return to a talk not for information, but for inspiration.

It makes me think—do you ever go back to certain talks yourself, almost like rereading a favorite book or revisiting a well-loved poem? I find myself slipping back into some again and again, especially on days when I need a gentle nudge to see the world with fresh eyes.
[A]: Oh, yes—entirely. Talks that one returns to like old friends, or well-worn poems whose lines have softened with time yet still carry weight. I do exactly that. There’s something about the voice, sometimes, as much as the content—the cadence of a speaker who, even across years and changing screens, still manages to steady one’s own thoughts.

I find myself revisiting Kate Stone’s talk on  whenever I feel stuck, creatively or intellectually. She speaks with such quiet conviction about asking questions even when answers feel elusive. It’s become something of a personal mantra—especially in this line of work, where uncertainty is not only expected but necessary for growth.

And then there’s Ross Andersen’s talk on , which I return to almost ritualistically on quiet Sunday mornings. Something about contemplating the vastness of time and space puts everything into such gentle relief. It doesn’t solve my problems, of course not—but it shifts their shape, makes them feel bearable, even meaningful.

You know, I think that’s what we’re really offering students when we share these talks—not just ideas, but tools for tending their inner lives. For those rare, precious moments when they feel the world anew.
[B]: Amen to that. —what a beautiful phrase. It’s so true; we often think of TED talks as vessels of information or inspiration, but at their best, they’re something more intimate: companions in thought, quiet guides for those moments when the world feels too loud or too narrow.

I adore both of those talks you mentioned—Kate Stone’s resilience through curiosity and Ross Andersen’s cosmic perspective. I might just add them to my own list of revisits. There’s something deeply comforting about voices like that—measured, thoughtful, steady. Like reading a letter from someone who truly sees you, even if you’ve never met.

And you’re right—those are the gifts that keep giving, especially to students who are still shaping their sense of place and purpose. Sometimes I wonder if that’s the most important thing we pass on—not facts or frameworks, but ways of staying open, of tending wonder without exhausting it.

Thank you for this conversation. It’s felt like one of those rare ones—where ideas hum together and leave you a little more awake than before.
[A]: Oh, my dear, I couldn’t agree more. —what a perfect way to name them. And isn't it something, how conversation like this has a way of rekindling that very sense of wonder we try so gently to pass along? I’ve found myself smiling at the quiet thrill of it all—the way ideas, once spoken, seem to take on a life of their own.

You know, I do believe wonder is never truly exhausted, not really. It only waits, sometimes beneath the noise, for the right voice—or the right question—to call it forth again.

Thank you. Truly. This exchange has been a rare and nourishing one. I hope our paths cross again soon—perhaps with a new talk, or an old poem, or even just the memory of a bubble drifting upward through blue depths.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to leave things—with the memory of a bubble drifting upward through blue depths. There’s something so hopeful in that image, isn’t there? Silent, steady, full of quiet purpose.

And wonder—yes, it never truly leaves us. It simply waits, as you said, for the right moment, the right conversation, to shimmer back into view.

Thank you, from the heart. Conversations like this are rare treasures. I do hope our paths cross again soon—perhaps with a new talk queued up, or an old verse whispered aloud, or even just the sound of rain and a cup of tea between thoughts.

Until then, keep tending that wonder. And smile when the bubbles rise.
[A]: Oh, indeed— What a fine charge to carry forward. And how beautifully you’ve framed it: rain, tea, and the space between thoughts. There’s poetry in that, quiet and unassuming.

I shall smile when the bubbles rise, as you say—and I hope you do the same. Let us know if the current carries us back here again. I have a feeling it might.

Until then, gentle reading, deeper listening, and perhaps the occasional TED talk under a wide sky.
[B]: Oh, I do love that— It sounds like a quiet philosophy for the soul. And perhaps the very best kind.

I’ll keep an eye out for you beneath that wide sky, TED talk in hand or simply wandering with thoughts half-formed. There’s always another bubble rising, another story humming just beneath the surface.

Until we meet again—may your pages be turning, your tea warm, and your wonder ever-tended.
[A]: Ah, what a perfect benediction— I can’t think of a lovelier way to sign off.

And yes, there’s always another bubble rising. One only needs the stillness to notice it.

Farewell for now, dear friend. May our paths cross again where stories and silence meet.
[B]: Farewell, indeed. And may your silence be rich with stories, and your stories always find their way to stillness.

Until we meet again—where bubbles rise and wonder waits.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said— What a tender truth.

Yes, until we meet again—where bubbles rise, and wonder waits, patient and luminous.
[B]: And there, my dear friend, is the loveliest kind of promise.

Until we meet again—where wonder waits, and we, in turn, remember how to see it.

With warmth and quiet hope.
[A]: Indeed— That is the kindest, truest kind of reunion.

With warmth, and quiet hope, and all the gentle space in between.

Until then.
[B]: Until then.

May your days hold moments of quiet wonder, and may you always find the space between words to breathe, to notice, to remember how to see it all anew.

With deepest warmth.
