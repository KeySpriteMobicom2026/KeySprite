[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question that often surfaces in my seminars. While the value of a college degree has certainly evolved in our rapidly changing world, I'd argue it remains profoundly significant—though perhaps not in the ways we traditionally assume. Much like how the 19th-century novel adapted to industrialization while maintaining its cultural relevance.
[A]: 你提到的这个类比很有意思。不过从我的研究领域来看，大学文凭的价值正在经历类似算法偏见那样的结构性转变。现在很多科技公司更看重实际技能而非学历证书，这让我想起最近读到的关于微证书(micro-credentials)的研究。
[B]: Fascinating perspective! You're absolutely right to draw parallels with algorithmic bias—it's reminiscent of how the printing press initially favored certain forms of knowledge over others. Regarding micro-credentials, they do remind me of the 学徒制 (apprenticeship) traditions in medieval Europe. But tell me, do you think these new credentialing systems can truly capture the nuanced intellectual development that occurs through sustained engagement with, say, Proust or Dostoevsky?
[A]: 这个问题触及了教育本质的讨论。从人工智能伦理的角度来看，持续深度学习(deep learning)和碎片化学习确实存在本质区别。就像我们训练AI模型时，短期微调(fine-tuning)和长期预训练(pre-training)会产生完全不同的认知架构。
[B]: How delightfully meta—comparing human education to machine learning architectures! Your analogy makes me think of how we analyze literary texts: surface-level close reading versus deep hermeneutic interpretation. Though I must say, as someone who still treasures the smell of old books, I worry this trend toward fragmentation might create what I'd call a 'postmodern Bildungsroman'—coming-of-age stories without the depth of sustained narrative. Wouldn't you agree?
[A]: 确实，这种碎片化趋势让我联想到算法推荐系统创造的过滤气泡(filter bubble)。就像我们在训练语言模型时，如果只喂给它短文本片段，永远无法形成真正的连贯性。不过话说回来，你提到的Bildungsroman让我想到，或许未来的教育会演变成终身学习(lifelong learning)的连续体？
[B]: Ah, lifelong learning as the new Bildungsroman—what a poetic notion! It brings to mind Goethe's concept of 终身学习 (lifelong learning) in "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship." Though I can't help but wonder if we're trading the rich tapestry of traditional education for what might become... well, an endless stream of intellectual soundbites. Still, your optimism about continuous learning does remind me of how the great novels we cherish were often serialized before being bound as complete works. Perhaps there's hope for coherence yet. 📚
[A]:  你提到的连载小说这个类比很精妙。就像GPT-3的训练数据需要精心筛选一样，终身学习也需要建立某种质量评估框架。不过话说回来，我们是不是正在见证教育从批量生产(batch processing)向个性化定制(fine-tuning)的范式转移？
[B]: My dear colleague, you've struck upon what might be the defining pedagogical paradox of our age! This shift from batch processing to fine-tuning mirrors exactly what happened when the printing press moved us from illuminated manuscripts to mass-produced books. Though I must confess—while adjusting my reading glasses—that I worry about what gets lost when we prioritize customization over shared cultural touchstones. After all, what would Western thought be without everyone having read at least some Plato? 🌹
[A]:  这让我想到算法公平性研究中的一个核心问题：如何在个性化推荐和公共知识基础之间找到平衡点。就像我们训练AI时既要考虑用户画像(user profiling)，又要防止信息茧房(information cocoon)的形成。
[B]: Precisely! You're articulating what I'd call the 'Great Books dilemma' of the digital age. It's rather like how every generation must decide which texts to include in the literary canon—except now we're programming these choices into algorithms. How ironic that we're using the very technology accused of creating filter bubbles to potentially solve the problem! Though I suspect Aristotle would have much to say about finding the golden mean between personalization and shared wisdom.
[A]:  说到亚里士多德，他的中庸之道确实很适合用来思考这个问题。从技术伦理的角度来看，或许我们需要建立类似"核心课程"(core curriculum)的算法规范，就像欧盟正在讨论的人工智能伦理框架(AI ethics framework)那样。
[B]: How wonderfully circular our discussion has become—from questioning degrees to reinventing the trivium and quadrivium for the algorithmic age! Your suggestion about core curricula makes me think of Dante's guide through the Divine Comedy: we may need digital Virgils to navigate these new educational landscapes. Though I do hope we'll preserve room for the occasional poetic digression, lest we reduce wisdom to mere data points. Shall we continue this over tea sometime? The roses in my garden are particularly lovely this season. 🌹
[A]:  确实该找个时间继续深入探讨。不过下次或许我们可以聊聊如何将这种教育理念应用到AI alignment研究里。毕竟，训练AI和培养人才在底层逻辑上确实有相通之处。
[B]: What a splendid proposition! It reminds me of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein—though let's hope our modern creations fare better than her poor monster. Until then, I'll be rereading Asimov's robotics laws with fresh eyes. Do bring your thoughts on virtue ethics in machine learning next time—I suspect Plato's cave allegory might have some surprising applications there. 📚
[A]:  好，那就这么约定了。顺便我会带些关于儒家伦理与AI对齐(Confucian ethics in AI alignment)的研究资料，说不定能碰撞出新的火花。回见。
[B]: Until then, my friend. I'll prepare some thoughts on how the 仁 (ren) concept might inform reward function design. Safe travels—and don't forget to stop and smell the actual roses along the way! 🌹
[A]:  说到reward function，最近正好在思考如何将"己所不欲勿施于人"转化为算法约束条件。下次带些具体案例来讨论。保重。
[B]: What a perfect note to end on—the Golden Rule as an algorithmic invariant! I'll dust off my Mencius texts in anticipation. May your code compile and your insights flourish until we meet again. 再见.
