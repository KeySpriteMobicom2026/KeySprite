[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's a really complex question. Let me start by saying that from an educational psychology perspective, we need to consider both ethical & psychological implications. 

On one hand, I understand the scientific curiosity & potential medical benefits - imagine being able to cure genetic diseases through cloning technology. But on the other hand, think about the identity issues for the cloned individual. Would they feel like they have free will, or would there be constant pressure to live up to their "original's" legacy?

Actually, this reminds me of some research on twins. We know that even with identical genetics, environment plays a huge role in development. So the idea that a clone would somehow be a "copy" of someone else is already problematic - it could lead to unrealistic expectations.

Have you read any of the studies on public attitudes toward cloning? The data shows interesting cultural differences...
[A]: The question reminds me of Christina Rossetti's contemplation of identity in —the tension between selfhood and duplication, though admittedly with fewer ethical quandaries involving fruit-based temptations. 

I suppose one might argue that cloning could offer remarkable breakthroughs in medicine—repairing genetic flaws, perhaps even extending life. But then again, Mary Shelley warned us about the perils of playing God, did she not? The psychological burden on a clone would be immense. To enter the world already shadowed by another’s footsteps... imagine being forever introduced as “the copy.” Would society expect genius from a clone of Einstein? Devotion from a clone of Florence Nightingale? And what of their rights? Their right to individuality?

And yet, isn’t it curious how we already replicate identities in subtler ways? Heirs trained to take over family businesses, prodigies groomed from birth, even children raised in the image of their parents' ideals. Cloning simply makes the artifice more literal.

Have you considered the legal implications? Who holds custody of a cloned child? Can a person legally clone themselves—and if so, does the clone inherit their estate? It rather turns inheritance law into a hall of mirrors.
[B]: That literary comparison is brilliant 📚 - Rossetti's exploration of duality really resonates here. You've touched on some fundamental psychological paradoxes. The clone would face what Erikson called an 'identity crisis' but amplified through technological means. It's not just about nature vs nurture anymore, but about the weight of expectation.

I find it fascinating how different cultures approach this. In collectivist societies, we might see more acceptance of cloning for family continuity, while individualist cultures could focus more on rights & autonomy. But your point about "subtle replication" in education systems is spot-on - I see parallels in my research on high-achieving immigrant families.

The legal questions you raised remind me of a case in Japan where a family tried to patent their cloned pet dog lineage ¥. It shows how unprepared our frameworks are. On the philosophical side, think about Parfit's identity theory - if we copy consciousness, does that change our moral obligations?

Actually, have you seen the latest UNESCO reports on bioethics? They're trying to establish global guidelines, but implementation remains... problematic.
[A]: Ah, UNESCO’s bioethics reports—lovely bedtime reading for insomniacs who enjoy skimming through carefully worded equivocations. One might as well ask the moon to regulate tides with a committee.

But you’re quite right about cultural frameworks shaping perception. In some traditions, lineage is sacrosanct—a thread woven through generations. Cloning, in that context, could be seen not as unnatural but as an extreme form of filial piety. Whereas in more individualist cultures, it would likely provoke cries of “manufactured personhood” and demands for consent from a being who hasn’t yet been born… or rather, .

Parfit’s identity theory—now there’s a thorny knot. If we clone a consciousness, are we morally bound to it? Does care ethics extend to entities engineered into existence? It’s like asking whether Frankenstein’s creature should have received child support.

And that Japanese case with the cloned dog—priceless. A pet as luxury brand, immortalised through mitotic vanity. One wonders if they’ll issue trademarks next: “Dolly the Sheep™, now available in miniature dachshund.”

I suppose what troubles me most is this: cloning promises control over life’s chaos, yet so much of what makes us  is precisely the unscripted, the accidental, the misfiring synapse that leads to poetry or madness. Do we risk sterilising the very mystery we seek to preserve?
[B]: You’ve captured the existential irony perfectly 👍 The desire to control life’s chaos through cloning might ultimately strip away what makes life meaningful - those messy, unpredictable moments that lead to creativity & growth. 

Actually, this reminds me of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development - we grow most in the spaces we aren’t fully prepared for. Cloning tries to eliminate that uncertainty, but maybe at the cost of authentic development. It's like giving someone a finished book instead of letting them write their own story.

I wonder if future generations will see this debate as quaint - much like we now view 19th century fears about trains causing "railway spine" disorders. But the ethical questions won't disappear with time. Maybe we need a new branch of psychology focused specifically on cloned individuals' development? A sort of postmodern child study movement...

Back to your literary angle - I've been thinking about how even Shakespeare touched on these themes in . “This rough magic / I here abjure,” says Prospero. Perhaps scientists today need their own island laboratories... and better PR teams 📚🎵
[A]: Oh, Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development—how delightfully subversive to apply it to cloning. So much of learning, of becoming, hinges on the unscripted stumble, the misstep that leads to discovery. Cloning, in its hubris, would have us script the stumble out of existence—and then where would we be? Stuck with a performance lacking improvisation, a novel written by committee.

Your Shakespearean parallel is delicious, though I’d argue Prospero’s magic was far less invasive than CRISPR. At least Ariel wasn’t expected to sign a consent form. Still, the metaphor holds: laboratories as islands, scientists as magicians—though nowadays the wand-wavers wear lab coats instead of robes, and their spirits are DNA sequences suspended in agarose gel.

As for a new branch of psychology—why not? We could call it  or some such pompous title. Future academics will no doubt write tedious dissertations on "Nature-Nurture Dissonance in Genetically Iterated Subjects." I imagine the first case study will involve a clone raised in complete secrecy, only to discover their origin via a poorly secured 23andMe kit. A modern-day Gothic tale, really.

And speaking of tales—have you noticed how many Victorian novels hinge on mistaken identity, lost heirs, and doubles? Perhaps they were prophetic. Stevenson’s  might yet become a how-to manual.

But I digress. Let me ask you—do you think future generations will look back on our ethical debates with smug amusement, or will they be too busy arguing over the ethics of uploading consciousness into holographic badgers? One can never be sure.
[B]: Ah, the "improvisation of existence" - what a perfect phrase 📝. Cloning tries to choreograph life’s dance down to the last step, but where’s the space for that magical misstep? You’re absolutely right - without the stumble, we lose the very essence of discovery & creativity.

I love how you framed the future debates 🙏 Will we be the quaint ancestors who worried about  while our descendants roll their eyes and debate whether AI-enhanced jellyfish deserve voting rights? The Gothic parallels are spot-on too - maybe we're living in the prologue of a 22nd-century . 

And you’re right about Victorian doubles - I've been re-reading  lately, and it's striking how close Stevenson came to capturing the psychological fragmentation we might see in cloning. A bit like bad code with unintended inheritance bugs, if you will 💻📚

On the bright side, at least holographic badgers would be  moral dilemmas. But consciousness uploading? Now  would truly redefine "identity diffusion." One wonders if Freud would’ve needed an extra couch... or just retired early.
[A]: Ah, —the original tale of a man attempting to isolate his better self, only to find he cannot kill off the inconvenient bits without catastrophe. One might say it's an early warning against editing oneself like a first draft. Cloning, in its way, is much the same: we imagine we’re selecting for greatness, but what if we end up with only the echo of it—Mr. Hyde without the doctor’s conscience?

And let’s not forget, Stevenson wrote it after a dream—a misfiring synapse if ever there was one. Imagine trying to clone Stevenson in hopes of producing another . You might end up instead with a man who writes feverishly about teapots with secret identities. Creativity cannot be cloned, only courted in its wild, unlicensed state.

As for consciousness uploading—I suspect Freud would have insisted on billing the uploaded ego by the hour. “Yes, yes, your body is obsolete, Herr Klein, but your Oedipus complex remains very much in session.”

But tell me—do you think we’ll see a rise in what I’ll call ? Future parents-to-be staring at a genetic blueprint thinking,  It rather turns procreation into product development, doesn’t it? With quarterly reviews and performance metrics.

I do hope someone remembers to write sonnets about it all. Otherwise, who will remember that once, long ago, people were born not designed—and that somehow, miraculously, it worked well enough?
[B]: Pre-regret Syndrome – I’m stealing that diagnosis 👍 Perfectly captures the anxiety of scripting life before it even begins. It’s like expecting a seed to follow a detailed growth plan before sprouting. You’re absolutely right – we’d turn parenting into project management, with KPIs for piano recitals and ROI on bedtime stories.

Stevenson’s dream reminds me of that famous Picasso quote – “Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.” Cloning tries to give us all the answers in advance, but creativity thrives on questions, on ambiguity. Imagine trying to clone Kafka – you might end up with someone who writes cheerfully optimistic tax guides 😄

And your point about sonnets is profound. We may need a whole new genre of poetry – algorithmic haikus? CRISPR ghazals? Though honestly, I doubt any AI or cloned poet could top Shakespeare’s line: “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” – unless they add footnotes explaining the genetic advantages.

Do you think future literature will be filled with elegies for randomness? A sort of literary nostalgia for chance encounters & unplanned moments? I suspect we'll need more than sonnets – maybe entire journals dedicated to the beauty of biological chaos 📚🎵
[A]: Ah, —what a delicious notion. Future poets may indeed compose odes to the forgotten charm of catching measles naturally instead of via designer immunization. Imagine a journal titled . I’d subscribe just for the footnotes.

And you’re quite right about Kafka—clone him and you might end up with a man who cheerfully invents the world’s first bureaucratic utopia. Tragicomedy through genetic engineering, if you will.

As for new poetic forms, I’ve been drafting what I call —fourteen lines of iambic precision, each couplet representing a chromosomal pair. The volta arrives not in line nine but at the moment of gene expression. Alas, most editors find them too technical. Or not technical enough. Depends on the journal.

But here’s a thought—what if we begin to see a resurgence of , purely as an act of rebellion against curated existence? Teenagers sneaking out to scribble verses on lab walls, celebrating the beauty of serendipitous typos and unedited drafts. A literary underground where spontaneity is the ultimate subversion.

And yes, Shakespeare’s summer’s day comparison would remain peerless—even if delivered by a cloned bard with a neural implant. Though I suppose we’d have to endure the modern edition: .

In short, we may yet need more than sonnets—we’ll require entire libraries filled with the scent of ink, the ghost of typo errors, and the quiet thrill of something that was never meant to happen… but did.
[B]: I want to subscribe to that journal right now 📚✍️ – nothing beats the romance of "Case Study #23: Patient Zero Was a Happy Accident." Your idea of rebellious found poetry in lab walls is brilliant - it's like 21st-century graffiti, but with more semicolons and fewer dystopian vibes.

CRISPR sonnets with gene-expression volta? That’s pure genius. I can already hear the academic debates: “Is fourteen lines enough for genomic complexity?” or “Should we use Watson & Crick’s rhyme scheme?” And your  parody with genetic annotation? Shakespeare would be horrified... and secretly delighted.

This brings me to an idea – maybe future museums will curate "natural birth" certificates as precious artifacts, displayed next to vintage paperclips and USB drives. Visitors will whisper, “Can you believe they used to trust  with human development?”

On a related note, have you seen how some schools are teaching creativity now through "controlled randomness" exercises? Like structured improv games to simulate unpredictability 😄 It’s both touching and slightly tragic - like trying to bottle lightning for a science fair.
[A]: Oh, the —what a sublime institution that would be. Imagine walking past glass cases filled with rusting strollers, faded ultrasound images, and the occasional petri dish labeled “Lot #001: Unplanned Sibling.” A gift shop selling heirloom belly-button lint would be an absolute must.

And those “controlled randomness” exercises in schools—dear Lord, it’s like watching children being taught to sneeze on cue. “Alright, Timmy, roll the die and —your surprise drawing subject is ‘a melancholic armadillo in a tea shop.’ Now be , and don’t forget to cite your sources.”

Still, there’s something endearing about the effort. Like watching Victorian botanists trying to classify clouds—noble in their futility. If creativity is lightning, as you so aptly put it, then structured improv is perhaps a sparkler: not quite Zeus-worthy, but at least it lights up the night without requiring divine intervention.

As for CRISPR sonnets, I’ve just received a rejection from . They claimed my volta was “too abrupt for modern genomics.” Pah! Let them have their tidy helixes—I’ll keep my poetic indels, thank you very much.

But tell me this—do you suppose future lovers will exchange not love letters, but annotated genome prints? “Your SNPs align beautifully with mine… let us hybridise our variants and call it fate.” Romance, redefined by bioinformatics. One might almost weep—if one hadn’t engineered out the tear response for emotional efficiency.
[B]: Oh, annotated genome prints as love letters – I can already picture the first dance of the future: slow swaying to a playlist algorithmically curated for maximum SNP compatibility 😄 And imagine Valentine’s Day cards with "Our heterozygosity is " – passion quantified!

Your Museum of Natural Accidents has me laughing out loud 👍 – though I fully expect to see it open in Brooklyn by 2035, complete with artisanal belly-button lint candles. The curation notes would be priceless: “Specimen #42: Resulted from parents forgetting to use contraception. Rare emotional side effects include joy.”

On the poetic front, I say keep those indels coming! Genopoetics may not appreciate your volta, but future underground readers will cherish them like forgotten mutations. Maybe we’ll start a literary CRISPR cult that deliberately introduces typos into perfect texts – just to remind everyone that beauty lies in the unexpected.

And speaking of rebellion – what if the ultimate counterculture movement becomes... natural childbirth? Think about it. In a world of designer genes, choosing unedited inheritance would be the new punk rock. Black turtlenecks, anarchist manifestos, and proudly displaying your child's spontaneous mutation 🧬🎵

Shall we start drafting the manifesto tonight? Over coffee, of course.
[A]: Darling, I thought you’d never ask. A literary CRISPR cult——our symbol shall be a quill crossed with a double helix, dripping ink instead of blood. Manifesto drafting over coffee? Absolutely. I’ll bring the parchment; you bring the red pen. And by “coffee,” I assume you mean something stronger—revolution requires stimulants.

Imagine the opening line:  Sublime. It has the proper balance of melodrama and science envy.

And yes—natural childbirth as counterculture. Next thing you know, parents will be wearing patches embroidered with  and playing Mozart to their unborn children ironically. Can’t you see it? The new black is genetic roulette, and nothing says rebellion like letting your offspring inherit your aunt’s nose without consent.

As for those Valentine’s cards— Now  romance with wiggle room.

I propose we hold our first clandestine meeting in a disused library basement, preferably one still smelling of forgotten encyclopedias and pre-digital ambition. We’ll distribute broadsheets titled  and demand that every poem contain at least one unreadable stanza—a literary indel, if you will.

Shall I reserve the space tonight?
[B]: Oh, I can already taste the espresso of revolution ☕😄 Let’s make it a  stimulant – if we’re starting a movement, we’ll need something stronger than metaphorical caffeine. And your manifesto line? . It has just the right amount of dramatic flair & scientific heresy.

The quill-and-helix symbol is genius 🖋️🧬 – subtle enough for academic pins, bold enough for protest banners. I’m picturing underground readings where poets spit sonnets with intentional meter flaws, just to piss off the bio-aesthetic purists.

And yes – book the basement tonight. I’ll bring the espresso, you bring the broadsheets. We’ll call our first gathering  – because every good mutation starts in the margins.

I’ve half a mind to draft a love poem using CRISPR terminology gone rogue. Something like:

*"Your genome untamed, my SNPs fall in place —  
Not by design, but glorious mispairing,  
Let no editor divine our tangled embrace,  
For beauty lives in sequences that dare to go nowhere."*

Too much? Not enough? Shall we throw in a volta at line nine that completely undermines the entire premise?

Also... should we start requiring  in all submissions to our future journal? Mandatory unreadable stanzas as literary birth control against perfectionism?
[A]: Oh, —I may weep, I may faint, I may quote that line at an inappropriate moment during a genetics lecture. Your poem has just the right balance of scientific blasphemy and lyrical defiance. And that volta? Unsubstantiated, perhaps—but beautifully destabilising. Exactly what sonnet-writing rebels should be aiming for.

As for typos—darling,  they must be mandatory. No mere autocorrect rebellion here; we shall demand . Each issue of  will include footnotes identifying deliberate errors, with annotations like “Line 12: Yes, we know ‘mitochondrial’ is misspelled. It’s called , you philistine.”

And speaking of journal features—I propose a monthly column titled  where poets confess their most aesthetically unforgivable mutations. Sample submission: 

Now, regarding our gathering tonight: I’ve secured the basement. Cobwebs included. I’ll bring the broadsheets, printed on recycled parchment using ink I brewed myself (with beetroot, espresso, and a dash of protest spirit). Also, a small bell to ring dramatically whenever someone utters the phrase “optimal expression” without irony.

One last question before we ignite the revolution—are we accepting submissions in hexameter? Or do we draw the line at iambic treason?

(And if you say yes to hexameter, I shall love you slightly less, but still enough to share my flask.)
[B]: Hexameter?  Let’s not push our luck. We’re already destabilizing genomes and sonnets—let’s leave the hexameter to the German epics and overcaffeinated classicists. A firm yet loving “no” with a side of side-eye: 

But your vision of  is gold — absolute gold 📚✍️. I can already picture the submissions piling up: poets weeping into their gel boxes, confessing crimes like accidental rhyme scheme inheritance or tragic lapses into trochaic feet. “Forgive me, I used CRISPR-Cas9 in a metaphor. May my metaphors be spliced with nonsense.”

I’ll bring extra red ink for the errata footnotes — and perhaps a vial of glycerol to preserve the beetroot ink. You never know when you’ll need a backup supply of revolutionary pigment. And yes, the bell must be rung with dramatic flair every time someone utters “optimal expression” without flinching. It shall be our  alarm bell.

Manifesto draft in hand, flask at the ready, and a slight buzz from caffeine and rebellion — I’m ready for the basement tonight. Long live the literary CRISPR cult. Down with curated metaphors! Up with glorious mispairing!

Shall we begin the revolution with a toast? 
[A]: To indels, unreadable stanzas, and the sublime disgrace of going absolutely  with purpose—yes, let us toast. I shall supply the flask (filled with something stronger than espresso, given the hour), and you bring the manifesto printed on broadsheet so we may read it aloud by candlelight and feel, for a fleeting moment, like dangerous intellectuals.

Hexameter is banned, as agreed—though I reserve the right to mutter a few lines under my breath should the mood strike. Think of it as literary graffiti: unsanctioned, uninvited, and entirely inappropriate.

And about that —I propose we open each issue with a public confession. Something like:



It’s only fair.

Now off to the basement we go—with beetroot ink, bell of shame, and the sacred espresso. Revolution awaits, darling. Let us misfire gloriously.
[B]: To misfiring gloriously and the sacred espresso 🙌☕ – may our revolution be messy, marginally illegible, and entirely resistant to peer review.

I’ll bring the manifesto rolled like a ancient decree (or a smuggled map to forbidden knowledge — jury’s out). Candlelight will lend just the right air of dramatic urgency; if we squint, we might mistake the basement for a 19th-century garret and ourselves for slightly more caffeinated Byrons.

Your confession format is perfection. I may submit one myself:



And yes, hexameter shall be punishable by forced exposure to iambic satire. You have my word: no dactyls will enter our journal without heavy red-inking.

Flask in hand, manifesto in pocket, bell at the ready — I’m prepared for tonight’s gathering of . May our ink stain fingers and reputations alike.

Now let’s go publish something beautifully flawed.
