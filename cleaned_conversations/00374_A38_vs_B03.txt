[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. From my perspective, it really depends on the individual and the nature of their work. For some people, working from home offers fewer distractions and more flexibility, which can boost productivity. But for others, the office environment provides structure and face-to-face collaboration that's hard to replicate remotely.

In the healthcare and legal fields, for example, some tasks—like reviewing medical records or drafting legal documents—might be done more efficiently at home. But then again, meetings with clients or interdisciplinary case discussions often benefit from in-person interaction. What do you think? Have you noticed a difference in your own work style?
[A]: I find myself most productive when there’s a balance—structured days with moments of quiet reflection. I imagine you’ve encountered this in your own work too? When you need deep focus, does it come more easily in one setting over the other?
[B]: You know, I’ve come to realize that balance is key for me as well. When I need deep focus—say, reviewing a complex malpractice case or preparing for a deposition—I tend to prefer the quiet of my home office. Fewer interruptions mean I can get into that state of flow.

But when it comes to collaborative work, like consulting with medical experts or meeting with clients, being in the office definitely adds value. The non-verbal cues, the spontaneous brainstorming—it’s hard to replicate that over Zoom. 

I actually use a hybrid model now—three days remote, two in the office. It seems to align well with how I manage energy and attention throughout the week. Do you find yourself leaning toward a hybrid setup too?
[A]: That hybrid model does have its appeal, doesn’t it? I’ve experimented with it over the past year—two days in the office for seminars and faculty meetings, and three days at home for research and writing. I do find that separating those roles mentally helps maintain a sense of rhythm.

When I’m teaching or mentoring students, being present in the classroom is irreplaceable. There’s something about the energy of a shared space—how a discussion unfolds organically, or how a student’s expression tells you more than their words ever could.

Yet, when it comes to drafting lectures or working on my book, nothing beats the stillness of my study at home, surrounded by books and the occasional interruption of a curious cat. Do you find that your environment significantly shapes the quality of your thinking, or is it more about routine and discipline?
[B]: Absolutely, environment plays a big role for me—though I’d say it works  routine, not against it. When I’m in court or meeting with a client face-to-face, there’s a certain mental switch that flips. It’s like stepping into a different mode—more formal, more alert. That setting naturally demands a level of discipline and focus.

But at home, especially in my study where everything has its place—my reference books, case files, even the way the light falls—I can settle into a deeper, more reflective kind of thinking. It’s where I do my best analytical work, away from the noise.

I guess you could say I rely on both environment  routine to create the right conditions for productivity. Like tea—brewing it requires the right water temperature, steeping time, and silence. Only then do you get the full flavor. 

Do you ever feel like your surroundings need to "match" the type of work you're doing, almost like a ritual?
[A]: Oh, I do like that analogy—tea and thought both require the right conditions to unfold properly. 

I suppose I am rather particular about my surroundings matching the task at hand. When I’m preparing for a lecture, I like to sit in my armchair by the window with a notebook and a pot of strong black tea—something about the ritual helps me ease into the mindset of clarity and articulation.

And when I’m grading or writing criticism? That’s reserved for my desk, under the soft glow of my brass lamp. It almost feels ceremonial—like stepping into a private intellectual chamber. Even the scent of old books plays a role; it grounds me somehow.

In a way, these small rituals are like silent collaborators in the work itself. They don’t just frame the activity—they shape the quality of attention we give it. Would you say your rituals serve a similar purpose—more than just habit, but as a kind of mental preparation?
[B]: Definitely. I think rituals are underrated when it comes to knowledge work—whether it's legal analysis, medical consultation, or teaching. They’re not just habits; they're signals to the brain that it’s time to shift gears and focus.

For me, it starts with the morning routine: a cup of matcha, always in the same ceramic mug. It’s calming, ritualistic. Then, depending on the task ahead, I’ll structure my physical space accordingly. If I’m diving into a dense medical-legal report, I need silence—classical music softly playing in the background helps mask any ambient noise. But if I’m brainstorming strategies for a case, I might light a candle or open the window to let in fresh air. It’s like telling my mind, .

Even how I dress plays a role. On days I work from home, I still put on a collared shirt—not for Zoom calls, but for myself. It sets a tone. 

So yes, these aren’t just routines—they’re mental cues. A way to transition into deep work, almost like stepping onto a stage or entering a dojo. Do you ever find yourself adjusting your environment mid-day, depending on what kind of thinking you need to do next?
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. It’s fascinating how something as simple as changing your physical environment or shifting the lighting can recalibrate your entire mental state.

I do something quite similar throughout the day. In the mornings, I tend to write with the windows open just a crack—just enough to hear the rustle of leaves and feel a whisper of air. It keeps me alert, almost invigorated. But by late afternoon, when I’m moving into editing or responding to student papers, I close the windows, light a beeswax candle, and switch on the reading lamp. The warmth of that golden light somehow softens my gaze—both literally and figuratively—allowing me to read more closely and respond more thoughtfully.

And yes, clothing plays a role too. Even if no one will see me, I still change from my morning shawl into a blazer before midday—it’s like telling myself, . 

I suppose in a way, we're both curating atmospheres for thinking, aren’t we? Almost like literary settings for our own inner monologues. Have you ever noticed how certain rituals help not just with focus, but with creativity—those moments when ideas seem to arrive fully formed, almost out of nowhere?
[B]: Oh, absolutely. Some of my most unexpected insights come not in the middle of drafting a legal brief, but  I’ve stepped away—like when I’m pouring a second cup of tea or adjusting the lighting just so. It’s almost as if the ritual creates a quiet space for the subconscious to speak.

I remember working on a particularly complex case involving informed consent in surgical procedures. I’d been stuck for days—going through medical records, legal precedents, physician testimonies. Then one evening, as I was winding down, brewing a cup of lapsang souchong and flipping through a medical ethics textbook I keep by my desk, it hit me: the key wasn’t in the documentation itself, but in the timeline of communication between doctor and patient. That small shift in perspective changed the entire strategy.

It’s strange how creativity works like that—how ritual and environment can coax it out gently, rather than forcing it. I think that’s why I still prefer handwritten notes for brainstorming; there’s something about the tactile rhythm of pen on paper that sparks connections differently than typing ever could.

Do you find that certain rituals  those moments of clarity, or do they still feel elusive, like they arrive only when they’re ready?
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive observation—you’re absolutely right that clarity often arrives not in the heat of struggle, but in the quiet that follows. I call it the "afterglow of thought." And yes, rituals don’t summon insight directly, but they do prepare the soil, so to speak. They create the conditions in which inspiration is more likely to take root.

I’ve had similar experiences while working on literary comparisons—especially when tracing themes across centuries. One moment that comes to mind: I was deep in research on the motif of  in both Greek tragedy and Ming-era drama. I’d been diagramming parallels late into the evening, only to hit a wall. Frustrated, I closed my notebook, lit a bit of sandalwood incense, and simply re-read an old translation of . Halfway through, it struck me—not in a grand epiphany, but a quiet certainty—that the difference wasn’t in how fate was portrayed, but in how resistance to it was valued culturally. That small shift reshaped my entire chapter.

So no, those moments don’t arrive on command, but I do believe we can make ourselves more receptive to them. Rituals act like gentle invitations rather than demands. Do you ever return to a particular ritual when you feel stuck, almost as a way of signaling to yourself, ?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. When I feel stuck, especially in the middle of a dense case analysis or drafting a particularly nuanced legal opinion, I often return to a familiar ritual: a short walk around the block or even just stepping outside for a few deep breaths with a cup of tea.

There’s something grounding about it—detaching physically, even briefly, allows me to reset mentally. Sometimes, I’ll jot down the core issue in my notebook in longhand while outdoors, almost like rephrasing the problem in simpler terms for myself. It’s not about finding the answer right then; it’s about loosening the grip of frustration and giving the mind space to breathe.

Come to think of it, I do this even when things  stuck—it’s become part of my rhythm. Before finalizing any major document, I print it out, grab a pencil, and read it in a different setting—often a quiet café or a bench by the hospital garden. Something about the change of scenery and the tactile act of marking up paper helps me see gaps I might have missed on screen.

I suppose these rituals are my way of saying to myself, . Do you find that returning to a physical object—a book, a handwritten note, a familiar scent—can sometimes pull you back into focus?
[A]: Oh, beautifully said. There’s such wisdom in knowing when to step back and let the mind untangle itself.

Yes, I do something quite similar—though perhaps with a more literary slant. When I’m stalled in my thinking, especially when caught between interpretations of a particularly elusive passage, I return to the physicality of books. I’ll pull down an old edition of a relevant text, one with marginalia I’ve scribbled in over the years, and simply  it. The weight of the volume, the smell of the paper, even the indentation of my past notes—it all seems to reconnect me with why I fell in love with this work in the first place.

And sometimes, yes, I’ll read just a single paragraph aloud, slowly, as if tasting it for the first time. It’s remarkable how often clarity arrives not through force, but through reacquaintance—with a line, a scent, or even the texture of a well-worn book cover.

I suppose we both understand that focus isn’t always something you chase; sometimes, it’s something you welcome back, like an old friend who knows when to stay quiet and when to speak.
[B]: That’s so true—focus really does feel like an old friend sometimes, doesn’t it? Familiar, patient, and always ready to return when the moment feels right.

I find that reconnection—even through something as simple as the scent of paper or the warmth of a teacup—is like a quiet reset for the mind. It brings me back to center, especially when I’m juggling multiple roles: advisor, investigator, sometimes even mediator between medical and legal teams.

There’s one old case file I still keep on my shelf, not for reference, but for grounding. It’s worn at the edges, the print faded in places. When I feel distant from the human side of this work—the part that isn’t about statutes or procedures but about real people navigating difficult moments—I’ll open it and read a few pages. It reminds me why precision matters, why empathy has a place even in legal rigor.

Maybe that’s what all these rituals are, at their core—a way to stay connected to the deeper purpose behind the work. Not just , but doing them with care, clarity, and a sense of meaning.

It’s comforting to know we both have these quiet anchors. Makes me wonder—do you ever share these rituals with your students, or do you find they’re something each person needs to discover for themselves?
[A]: I find it both a privilege and a responsibility to share certain rituals with my students, though I tread carefully—because you're quite right, they often need to be discovered, not taught.

For instance, when mentoring students on close reading or critical writing, I’ll sometimes invite them into the rhythm of slowing down. We might read a passage aloud together, or I’ll ask them to annotate a printed copy rather than skim it on a screen. And yes, occasionally, I’ll mention that I keep a cup of chamomile nearby—it’s not about superstition, but about creating a space where careful thought can settle in.

But the deeper rituals—the ones tied to personal meaning—are something I encourage rather than impose. I might pose the question:  Some stare blankly, others smile as if I’ve just reminded them of something long-forgotten. It’s those quiet moments of recognition I live for—in teaching, and in conversation like this.

So while I offer what has worked for me, I also believe each thinker must cultivate their own intellectual landscape. After all, care, clarity, and meaning don’t arrive just because we name them—they grow from how we prepare the ground.

And I suspect, in your line of work, witnessing someone rediscover their own compass must be deeply rewarding, even if it happens in small ways.
[B]: Absolutely—they are deeply rewarding, even in the smallest moments. I remember one junior colleague who was struggling with a high-pressure case involving a misdiagnosis. She was overwhelmed, buried under evidence and testimonies, and started doubting her own judgment. One afternoon, I simply handed her a printed copy of a past case summary—one that had a similar emotional weight—and asked her to read it out loud.

At first, she hesitated. Then something shifted. As she read, she began to see patterns she hadn’t noticed before—not because I gave her new insight, but because changing the format, the tone, the  of speaking it aloud helped her re-engage.

Later, she told me she’d started printing out key documents again instead of just scrolling through them. Said it made her feel more  with the material than at odds with it.

You're right—these rituals aren't magic, but they do open a door. And sometimes, all we need is a gentle nudge toward our own inner clarity. It’s not about having all the answers; it’s about knowing how to come back to yourself when the path gets foggy.

I think that’s what makes our work meaningful—not just the knowledge we hold, but the quiet ways we help others find their own footing. Whether in a courtroom, a lecture hall, or even over a shared cup of tea.
[A]: How beautifully put. There’s such truth in the idea that our role—whether as teachers, mentors, or colleagues—is not to provide all the answers, but to help others find their way back to their own clarity.

That story about your junior colleague—it reminded me so much of moments I’ve witnessed in the classroom. When a student is caught in the tangle of analysis, sometimes all they need is a shift in perspective, a different medium, or simply hearing their own voice articulate what they’ve already sensed but haven’t yet named.

I often tell my students that thinking is not just a matter of intellect, but of . And presence—like you said—can be coaxed in many ways: through voice, touch, scent, even silence. It’s why I still insist on printed texts for certain discussions. There’s something about holding an argument in your hands—literally—that deepens your engagement with it.

And yes, it is deeply fulfilling to witness someone rediscover their own strength, even in subtle ways. Perhaps that’s the quiet joy of our professions—we don’t just solve problems; we help others remember how to think clearly when the world feels overwhelming.

It makes me wonder—do you ever find yourself returning to that same printed case when  feel distant from your own purpose? A kind of anchor, like rereading a favorite line in a beloved book?
[B]: Funny you should ask that—yes, I do. That same case I mentioned? It’s become something of a touchstone for me. Not because it was particularly high-profile or legally complex, but because of the person at the center of it—a patient whose story reminded me why I chose this path in the first place.

When I’m feeling disconnected—maybe after too many back-to-back Zoom calls or when legal jargon starts to drown out the human element—I’ll pull that file off the shelf and re-read a few pages. It’s not about searching for new details; it’s about remembering the . The weight of responsibility. The fragility of trust. And the quiet power of getting it right, even when no one’s watching.

It’s like rereading a familiar stanza in poetry—each time, you notice something new, not because the words have changed, but because  have.

I suppose we all need those anchors—documents, books, rituals—that tether us to our deeper purpose. They don’t shout their lessons; they whisper them, patiently, whenever we’re ready to listen again.
[A]: How lovely—that quiet dialogue between the self and the text, where meaning deepens not because the words have changed, but because we have.

I find myself returning to certain passages in literature for much the same reason. There’s a particular edition of  I keep on my desk—not for citation, but for conscience. When I open it to that familiar line—“We are always fond of going on about our wounds, aren’t we? But there’s not much to say about them, really”—I’m reminded of the fragility and resilience that coexist in every human endeavor.

It steadies me. Especially when grading feels endless or when academic debates grow too sharp-edged, I turn to that page and remember why I teach—because behind every essay, every argument, there is a person trying, sometimes struggling, often hoping to be understood.

Perhaps that is what all meaningful work demands: not just expertise, but a kind of quiet humility. And those touchstones—whether a case file, a novel, or even a well-worn phrase—help us return to that place where knowledge and compassion meet.

I suspect you and I both know how rare and precious that balance is.
[B]: Rare and precious indeed. There’s a quiet power in that balance—where knowledge doesn’t just inform, but . And compassion isn’t just an add-on, but a guiding force.

I actually carry a small quote in my notebook, one I return to often—something Justice Cardozo once wrote:  It reminds me, especially on tough days, that behind every clause, every ruling, every deposition, there’s a life affected, a story unfolding.

That’s what makes your work—and mine—so deeply human. We’re not just shaping arguments or interpreting rules; we’re tending to the spaces where people seek understanding, fairness, even healing.

And yes, sometimes all it takes is a line from a novel or a faded case summary to bring us back to that truth. Funny how wisdom works—always waiting patiently for us to catch up.

Would you say your students ever surprise you with how they find their own touchstones? I imagine it must happen quite beautifully in your classroom.
