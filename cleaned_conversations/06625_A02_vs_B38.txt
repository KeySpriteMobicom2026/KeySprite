[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, déjà vu... what a fascinating phenomenon to contemplate. As someone who spends her days immersed in literature, I'm particularly intrigued by how often this experience appears in 19th century novels. There's something rather poetic about that momentary sensation of having lived through a present moment before, don't you think?
[A]: 哇，说到déjà vu，这让我想起上周处理的一个medical malpractice case😊 当事人也提到了类似的体验。从神经科学角度来说，这其实是memory retrieval system的一个小glitch呢~
[B]: How interesting! Though I must admit, my expertise lies more in Proust's madeleine than in medical malpractice cases. The neurological explanation is certainly valid, but I find the literary interpretations equally compelling. Many modernist writers used this phenomenon as a narrative device to explore themes of memory and time.
[A]: 哈！说到memory and time，这让我想起最近读的一篇关于temporal lobe epilepsy的paper🎵 你知道吗？很多artists的创作灵感其实和这种神经活动异常有关呢~ 不过从legal perspective来看，这种状态下的行为责任认定就变得很复杂了🤔
[B]: My dear friend, you're making me reach for my well-worn copy of Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' - Prince Myshkin's epileptic auras were famously depicted as moments of transcendent clarity. While the legal implications are indeed complex, I can't help but wonder if we're losing something by reducing these profound human experiences to mere neurological misfirings. The intersection of art, medicine and law is truly a modern Gordian knot.
[A]: Exactly！这就是为什么我特别enjoy做medical legal consultant的工作~ 每个case都像在解一个复杂的puzzle，要把Article 15的legal standard和最新的fMRI研究结果结合起来看😊 不过说真的，有时候在courtroom上引用Dostoevsky可能会让jury很confused呢~
[B]:  Oh, I can just imagine the poor jury's faces if one started quoting 'Crime and Punishment' during a malpractice trial! Though between you and me, Raskolnikov's psychological turmoil might actually provide more insight into human behavior than some dry legal precedents. But perhaps we should leave the literary references to the classroom and the courtroom to more... empirical evidence.
[A]: 你说得对~ 在court上我们还是要stick to evidence-based approach🤓 不过私下里，我经常用literature来理解病人的心理状态。就像上周那个patient，他的case history简直就像是从Kafka小说里走出来的~ 但这话我可不敢写在expert report里！
[B]: Ah, Kafka! Now there's an author who understood the labyrinthine nature of both the human psyche and bureaucratic systems. While I wouldn't recommend citing 'The Trial' in your reports either, I do admire your ability to find literary parallels in your work. It's rather like how I sometimes spot legal conundrums in Henry James' novels - life and art reflecting each other in the most unexpected ways.
[A]: Haha~ 说到bureaucratic systems，我们医院的IRB approval process有时候真的让我想起Kafkaesque nightmare呢！😅 不过说正经的，这种跨学科的perspective其实对medical ethics的讨论特别有帮助。要不要改天一起喝咖啡继续聊？我最近发现了一家超棒的café，他们的latte art简直像brain scan images一样精致！
[B]: What a delightful invitation! A café where neuroscience meets barista artistry - how perfectly serendipitous. I'd be charmed to continue our conversation over coffee, though I must warn you, I still take mine black as a 19th century mourning dress. Shall we say next Thursday afternoon? I'll bring my well-thumbed copy of 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat' - it seems we've found the perfect intersection of our interests.
[A]: Perfect！Thursday works for me~ 我可以带上最新一期的Neurology Today期刊，里面刚好有篇关于déjà vu和false memory的fascinating study📚 到时候我们可以在margins上做notes，就像old school的literature review一样！See you then~ 😊
[B]: Splendid! I'll look forward to our little symposium - part neurological colloquium, part literary salon. Until Thursday then, when we shall attempt to reconcile Proust's madeleines with modern fMRI scans. Do give my regards to your Kafkaesque IRB committee in the meantime! 🌹
[A]: Will do！And I'll make sure to order anextra black coffee for you - no sugar, no cream, just like yourVictorian mourning aesthetic☕️ See you Thursday！Don't forget to bring that Sacks book~ 😉
[B]:  You've perfectly captured my rather antiquated caffeine preferences. Very well - black coffee, Oliver Sacks, and spirited debate await us. I shall be the one in the corner undoubtedly drawing parallels between neural pathways and Wordsworth's 'spots of time.' Until then! 📚
[A]: Haha deal！我们干脆把meeting命名为"从Déjà Vu到Dostoevsky：当Neurology遇上Literature"好了~ 说不定能发展成个monthly seminar series呢！Thursday见啦，别忘了你的black as night coffee preference！☕️✨
[B]: What a wonderfully pretentious title - I adore it! Though I suspect our monthly attendees might dwindle after we start comparing hippocampal formations to Proustian memory palaces. But for those brave enough to join us, what rich discussions await! Until Thursday, my fellow interdisciplinary adventurer. Keep your coffee black and your literary allusions sharper. 🌹
[A]: You got it！Black coffee and sharp allusions - 这就是我们的brand了😂 说不定下次还能拉上几个neurology residents一起来，让他们体验下humanities的魅力~ Catch you on Thursday！Don't be late or I'll start without you with an impromptu lecture on Freudian slips！😉
[B]:  Threatening me with Freudian slips over punctuality - now that's what I call proper academic motivation! Very well, I shall arrive with Victorian promptness, if only to spare everyone my unconscious revealing itself through verbal blunders. Though between us, I've always found Jung's collective unconscious far more compelling for literary analysis... but that's a debate for Thursday! Until then, my dear colleague in caffeinated scholarship.
