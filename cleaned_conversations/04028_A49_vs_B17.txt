[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, fashion trends... quite the fascinating intersection of culture and self-expression. While I've always admired the elegance of a well-tailored blouse or a classic woolen coat, I must confess my own wardrobe leans rather conservatively toward tweeds and cashmeres. 

I do find it intriguing how contemporary poets have begun weaving sartorial imagery into their verses—discussing fast fashion's impact on identity, or the symbolism of wearing masks as both garment and metaphor. Tell me, have you noticed any particular trends that strike you as especially poetic or meaningful?
[A]: Omg totally agree! 💡 I’ve been obsessed with this whole “quiet luxury” trend lately—it’s like minimalism but with a secret designer DNA, you know? Like wearing a cashmere sweater that looks super understated but actually costs as much as a small 🚗. It’s kinda poetic in a modern way, like stripping everything down to the essentials but still making it feel .  

But wait—masks as metaphor?? That’s deep & super on-point 🤔 I’ve noticed a lot of streetwear brands are using them as part of their SS24 collections—not just for health stuff, but more like a fashion statement about identity and privacy in the digital age. Have you seen those embroidered face coverings? They’re both eerie and beautiful✨  

And oh my gosh, fast fashion… it’s such a 🌑 hole. I mean, I get it—everyone wants to look good on Insta without breaking the bank 💸—but at what cost, right? Ethical fashion is where it’s at if you really think about it. So yeah, I guess clothes have become more than just fabric—they’re like stories we wear. What do you think?
[B]: Ah, you've touched on so many rich layers—how fashion has become a kind of wearable narrative. The idea of  does resonate; it reminds me of the subtlety in a well-placed metaphor—only those attuned to the language of fabric and form can truly decipher its worth. It’s curiously akin to the understated elegance found in the works of poets like Elizabeth Bishop, where meaning lies beneath the surface, unspoken yet deeply felt.

And those embroidered face coverings—yes! There's something hauntingly beautiful about them, isn't there? Like something out of a modern Gothic tale. I was recently re-reading Woolf’s , and it struck me how today’s masked fashion echoes her musings on identity and concealment. Masks now seem to symbolize not just protection or anonymity, but resistance—a way of saying: 

As for fast fashion... alas, it is the modern-day siren song—tempting, destructive, and eerily cyclical. Much like the Romantic poets who decried industrialization’s toll on nature, we now face a moral reckoning with consumption. I’ve begun mending my own clothes rather than replacing them, as one might reread a beloved poem—each wear, each tear, adding depth to the story.

Tell me, do you find yourself leaning toward more intentional choices in your wardrobe, or does the thrill of discovery in trend-chasing still hold its allure?
[A]: OMG yes—intentional fashion is totally my vibe now 🌱 I used to be all about chasing the latest drop, you know? Like,  💸 But honestly, after learning how much damage fast fashion does—like landfills full of clothes & workers getting paid ¥nothing—my heart just couldn’t cope.  

Now I thrift almost everything or invest in pieces that’ll last, like a killer leather tote or those timeless ankle boots 👢 It’s kinda like curating your own personal art exhibit, y’know? Every item has a story, and you’re the curator ✨ And tbh, thrifting can be way more fun than buying new—it’s like a treasure hunt! I found this vintage blazer last week that looks like it’s straight outta a 90s film noir scene 🎬

But hey, I’m not gonna lie—sometimes the trend bug still bites 😅 Like that  moment from Margiela’s latest show? Girl, I had to screenshot it 📸 Still, I try to balance the fun with mindfulness. After all, fashion shouldn’t cost the Earth, right? 🌍 So what about you—do you have any wardrobe staples that feel like old friends?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully articulated reflection—yes,  is precisely the word. There’s something profoundly personal about wearing garments with history, much like carrying around lines of poetry that have lingered in your soul.

As for my own wardrobe, you’re quite right—it’s filled with pieces that feel like old friends. A charcoal-gray herringbone coat I bought nearly fifteen years ago still hangs in my closet, its lapels softened slightly by time but no less dignified. And a pair of oxblood Oxford shoes, polished season after season, have accompanied me through lectures on Dickinson, frosty autumn walks, and more than one quiet evening with Eliot’s  They’ve become part of my narrative, subtly shaped by where they’ve taken me—and I by them.

I do admire your balance between indulgence and mindfulness. That Margiela glass shoe? I confess, even I paused over an image of it—there’s a kind of surreal poetry to footwear that borders on sculpture. It reminded me of how Modernist poets played with form—fragile-seeming, yet deliberately so, forcing us to reconsider movement, meaning, and material all at once.

Tell me, when you slip into that vintage blazer, do you ever feel as though you're stepping into someone else's story—or perhaps channeling a version of yourself long forgotten?
[A]: Ohhhh 💡 yes & no? It’s like… when I put on that blazer, I don’t feel like I’m wearing someone  story—I feel like I’m unlocking a part of  that wasn’t fully formed before 🌱 Like it was always in me, just waiting for the right piece to walk into my life.  

It’s weirdly similar to how I feel after reading a poem that hits just right—like Rilke or someone—where you’re like, “Ohhh,  what I’ve been feeling but couldn’t say.” That blazer? It made me feel powerful in a way I didn’t know I needed that day ✨ And honestly, isn’t that the best kind of fashion? The kind that doesn’t shout, but  confidence into your ear as you strut through life 👠

Do you ever have one of those pieces—like that coat or those shoes—that made you realize something new about yourself? Like, not just “I look good,” but “" 🤔
[B]: Absolutely. That moment of quiet revelation—when fabric becomes more than cloth, when a garment seems to echo something within you—is one of the most exquisite forms of self-discovery. I couldn’t agree more: it’s not about looking good, but about , even if only to oneself.

Funny you should ask—I had just such an experience with a silk scarf I once found tucked inside a secondhand copy of . It was delicate, slightly frayed at the edges, and smelled faintly of sandalwood and time. I wasn’t even sure I liked scarves until I tied it loosely around my neck one morning before a rather intimidating faculty meeting. Something shifted—not in how I looked, but in how I stood. It was as though that small, soft thing gave me permission to speak with a kind of quiet authority, like Eliot’s Tiresias, observing and weaving together fragments of meaning without apology.

I think that’s why I’ve always loved teaching poetry—because both verse and clothing can act as mirrors, revealing parts of ourselves we didn’t know were hidden. So yes, I understand exactly what you mean. Sometimes, all it takes is one perfect piece to say: 
[A]: OMG that scarf story just gave me literal chills 🥶✨ Like, how poetic can one person get?? Finding it in  of all books—girl, that’s not a coincidence, that’s . I totally get what you mean by “quiet authority,” too. I feel the same when I wear my go-to ring—it’s tiny, silver, kinda looks like it was doodled on a napkin, but every time I glance at it, I’m like… yeah, this is  No need to shout it.  

And yes YES to poetry & fashion as mirrors 💡 They both show us who we are without forcing us to say it out loud. Sometimes I’ll put on an outfit and be like… wait, is that  Like meeting yourself for the first time through your own reflection 👁️👄👁️  

So okay, deep question alert: if your wardrobe could speak in poetry, which poet would it choose to channel? For me, it’d 100% be Ocean Vuong—healing, soft, raw, but still strong 💪🏽💘
[B]: What a deliciously deep question—thank you for that.

If my wardrobe could speak, I think it would borrow the voice of Adrienne Rich. Not in her fiercest polemical tone, but in that quieter, insistent register she uses when unraveling the self—line by line, like pulling thread from a seam that was never meant to hold forever.

My clothes wouldn’t shout, they’d —layer by layer, revealing what’s been stitched beneath habit and expectation. A tweed jacket might murmur something about inherited tradition and the slow breaking of it; a well-worn scarf might whisper lines like:

> *I came to see the damage that was done  
and the treasures that prevail.*

Yes, Adrienne Rich feels right—honest, reflective, unafraid of contradiction. There's a kind of ethical elegance in her verse, much like the way I hope my wardrobe speaks: not炫耀ly stylish, but deeply 

And Ocean Vuong for you? Perfect—he writes with such aching tenderness, like fabric worn soft through use and love. I can almost picture your reflection in his words, gently re-stitched each day. 💜
[A]: Ahhh you described it so perfectly—“unfolding layer by layer” 💡 like every piece has a quiet truth waiting to be noticed. Adrienne Rich vibes? 100% spot-on. I can totally see your wardrobe being that friend who doesn’t yell, but when they speak? Everyone leans in 🤫✨

And yes—Ocean Vuong just  me, you know? Like his words feel like that one jacket you keep coming back to, even when it’s not in style anymore. It’s worn in all the right places, still fits in a way nothing else does, and wraps around you like a poem you’ve read a hundred times but still makes you feel something 💭

Okay, now I’m curious—who would your ideal fashion muse be if they had to dress like a poet? Like, if you could design a collection inspired by someone’s , whose closet would you peek into first? 🧐💘
[B]: Oh, what a delicious question—like dressing a soul rather than just a body.

If I were to design a collection inspired by a poet’s essence, my muse would be Emily Dickinson. But not the myth of her—the reclusive spinster in white we’ve come to romanticize. No, I’d look deeper, into the quiet rebellion of her verses, the way she wore solitude like a finely cut gown: deliberate, dignified, and full of secret fire.

The collection would be all texture and contrast—linens so crisp they whisper, silks that catch the light like a slant truth. Lots of whites and greiges, yes, but with hidden flashes of deep burgundy or indigo, like the pulse beneath a composed exterior. High necks, long sleeves, but with a loosened waist or an asymmetrical hemline—because constraint and liberation can coexist.

Accessories? Perhaps a single locket holding a pressed flower, or gloves slightly frayed at the fingertips, as if she’d been scribbling by candlelight again. And always, always a pocket deep enough for a folded scrap of paper and ink-stained fingers.

It would be fashion as interior monologue—meant not for display, but for  in. A wardrobe for the woman who speaks softly but carries a universe inside her.

Now I must ask you—what era would your Ocean Vuong-inspired collection pull from? Would it be all silk slips and streetlights, or something even more timeless?
[A]: OMG yes, Emily Dickinson as a fashion muse?? Chef’s kiss 👩🏽🍳✨ I can  it—like if her poems were translated into texture & cut. That mix of crisp linen and hidden color? It’s like wearing restraint but secretly burning inside 🔥 totally poetic.

For my Ocean Vuong-inspired collection, I think it’d be more , honestly 🌌 Like, a mix of eras with a soft, haunting vibe. Think silk slips that look like they were stolen from a 90s indie film heroine 💭 layered with oversized jackets that feel like protective armor. Some pieces would look like they’ve been loved + repaired a million times; others would feel brand new but still carry that ache of memory.

Lighting would be neon bleeding into golden hour, music would be a mix of lo-fi beats & Vietnamese lullabies playing in the background 🎧💔 And models wouldn’t “walk”—they’d wander, like they’re searching for something between past & future.

It’s not about one era—it’s about existing in all of them at once, y’know? Like reading a line of his poetry & suddenly remembering a version of yourself you thought was gone forever… that’s the mood I’d want the whole collection to wear.  

So okay, deep talk alert: If your dream wardrobe could walk into any scene from literature, where would it go? Mine would crash a Bukowski dive bar—but only to quietly observe, not participate 😏🍷
[B]: What a gorgeously vivid vision—your collection sounds like something that doesn’t just clothe the body, but shelters the soul. That  in fabric form? Exquisite.

As for my wardrobe stepping into a literary scene… hmmm.

I think I’d choose the drawing room at Monk’s House in —Virginia Woolf’s fictional biography that bends time, gender, and identity like light through crystal. Picture it: a long, sunlit room lined with books, inkwells, and letters half-written. My wardrobe would glide in wearing that charcoal-gray herringbone coat I mentioned, sleeves slightly dusted with the ghost of a quill’s feather, paired with a silk cravat borrowed from the 18th century but tied with modern irreverence.

It wouldn’t demand attention, no—but it would settle into a wingback chair by the fire, legs crossed at the ankle, sipping tea while Orlando—ever-shifting, ever-becoming—passes by in a procession of selves. The coat would murmur approval at each transformation, silently quoting:

> 

My wardrobe would bear witness not to fashion as spectacle, but as evolution—a quiet companion to the fluid self.

And yes, I’d let your quietly observant Bukowski barfly slip into the corner booth across the room. We'd raise our glasses to the beautiful mess of being human, without saying a word. 🍷✨
[A]: Yessss, that scene at Monk’s House sounds like  🕰✨ The kind where time stretches and you can just…  in all the layers of who you are—or could be—without rushing. Your coat as this silent witness to identity unfolding? Iconic. I mean, how many pieces of clothing actually feel wise?? But yours does. It’s got opinions on gender, time, and probably reads Woolf during its lunch break ☕️📘

And okay, yes—let our two wardrobes have a silent convo across that room 💭🍷 Mine would probably lean back in the booth with that slightly tired-but-woke energy, sipping something smoky and watching your coat sip tea like it's philosophy. No words needed, just vibes.  

So here’s my question for you: If your wardrobe had a soundtrack while dressing every morning, what would be on repeat? Like… what songs or artists make your closet sound like a poem coming to life? 🎶💘
[B]: Oh, what a lovely notion—my wardrobe with its own private soundtrack. I imagine it less like a playlist and more like a recurring dream set to music, something that hums beneath the act of choosing how to present oneself to the world.

At the top of the rotation? —especially his quieter, more meditative pieces. , with its hushed ache, feels like slipping into something honest, something you don’t quite understand until you’re already wearing it.

Then, —because every morning deserves a touch of grace, resistance, and velvet strength.  isn’t just a mood, it’s a reclamation.

And of course,  for those days when structure and repetition feel like poetry in motion. His piano études loop in my head like the rhythm of folding fabric, one sleeve at a time.

I’d also sneak in a little , played on an old vinyl, because some mornings call for fugues—those intricate, interwoven layers that mirror how we piece ourselves together: thought by thought, stitch by stitch.

So yes, my closet doesn’t just open—it . Every day, a new stanza, scored by silence and song.  

Now I’m curious—what would  fashion-forward poem playlist include? Would Vuong read aloud between tracks, or would the music speak first?
[A]: OMG I’m obsessed with your “wardrobe as composer” metaphor 🎵✨ It’s like getting dressed becomes a , not just an outfit. Sufjan Stevens + Nina Simone?? Iconic choices—they give that mix of vulnerability & power we all need before stepping out the door 💃🏽🔥

As for my fashion-forward poem playlist? It would  start with Joanna Newsom—her voice is like someone took a harp, wrapped it in velvet, and taught it to feel feels 💔 Her song  feels like putting on an oversized sweater in autumn: nostalgic, soft, slightly haunting.

Then we’d blast into FKA twigs —especially  😭 That raw, fragile beat? It’s like lacing up boots that hurt but make you walk taller. And her lyrics are pure body-as-poetry material.

Mid-dressing-moment, Ocean Vuong would absolutely read aloud from  📝💫 Maybe the poem  because... isn’t that how we all feel sometimes? Glamorous, isolated, melting under pressure 💄❄️

And then to close it out, some Arca or Arctic Monkeys (early) for that moody runway energy 👠🌀 We’re talking full transformation vibes here—like stepping into yourself mid-stride.

So yeah, my playlist wouldn’t just be music—it’d be a spoken-word fashion show. Mic drop 🎤👠  
Final question: If your wardrobe had its own astrology chart, what sign do you think it'd be? Mine’s 100% Pisces with a Gemini moon 😌💘
[B]: Oh, that playlist is —I can practically see the fabric of your identity shifting with each note. Vuong between tracks like a whispered incantation? Divine programming.

As for my wardrobe’s astrology chart—well, I do believe it would be a Taurus Sun, Libra Moon, Virgo Rising configuration. Let me explain:

Taurus because, well… comfort in texture, devotion to quality, and a stubborn refusal to wear anything that doesn’t  right—like a poem that lingers on the tongue. Earthy, enduring, grounded in the beauty of the tangible.

Libra Moon for the eternal dance with balance and aesthetic harmony. My closet agonizes over contrasts: softness with structure, muted tones with subtle richness. It wants not just to be seen, but to be 

And Virgo Rising for the meticulous presentation—because even if something looks effortless, rest assured, there was  A hemline perfectly pressed, a button chosen for its quiet symbolism—it’s fashion with footnotes.

Together? A constellation of thoughtfulness. Not flashy, never fussy, but always quietly composed—like a sonnet worn as silhouette.

And yes, Pisces-Gemini fits you beautifully—dreamy depth with a flicker of wit and movement. Tell me, does your wardrobe ever surprise you mid-outfit, like it’s suddenly become someone else’s?
[A]: Oh my gosh, YES 😂 I legit had to pause mid-sip on my matcha latte just now—your wardrobe’s astrology chart is so spot-on, I can imagine it slow-dripping into a coffee shop like "I don’t need astrology, " ☕️✨

Taurus Sun with Libra Moon?? That explains the whole “quiet luxury philosopher” vibe you’ve got going on. And Virgo Rising? Of course—every outfit has footnotes! Like your closet basically publishes a thesis every time you step out.

And girl, YES—my wardrobe  surprises me sometimes 🤭 Like last week, I was halfway through an outfit thinking “Okay, chill but cute,” and then I grabbed this sheer lavender top that screamed “I’m either about to fall in love or write a poem about falling in love.” Total plot twist by my own closet 😅💘

But okay, real talk: if your wardrobe could date mine, do you think they’d end up in a slow-dance or a deep convo over tea first? 🤨🍷
[B]: Oh, I think they’d  happen. Your wardrobe—impulsive, shimmering with possibility, already drafting love letters it hasn’t finished writing—would glide into the room wearing that lavender top like a secret.

Mine would notice. Not immediately, of course—it would wait, folded neatly in a quiet corner, observing. Then, after a long pause, it would offer a hand (or perhaps just a sleeve) and say, 

The first dance would be slow, uncertain—linen brushing silk, Taurus steadying Pisces with a grounded hold. But soon enough, your wardrobe would spin us both into something unexpected—maybe a waltz set to Sufjan Stevens, or a tango stitched with Vuong’s verses.

Eventually, we’d sit. Pour tea. Mine would listen more than speak, while yours would talk in metaphors and half-finished stanzas. And somehow, in that quiet exchange, we’d both feel a little more understood.

So yes—I think my wardrobe would fall for yours quite beautifully. A romance written in fabric, footnoted in feeling. 💬💜
