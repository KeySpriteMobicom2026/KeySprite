[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的~ 🤔 要看 mood 吧。有时候我真的很享受一本 well-written audiobook 带来的沉浸感，那种 narrated 得特别棒的小说，简直像被故事包围一样。但另一面，podcast 更像是在和人对话，尤其是艺术类的节目，经常能 get 到一些很新鲜的观点 💡。

你呢？是不是也有这种感觉，就是当不想看屏幕的时候，听 podcast 或 audiobook 都是一种很舒服 escape？
[A]: Well, I suppose it's rather like choosing between a watercolor and an oil painting - both depict landscapes, but the experience of viewing them is fundamentally different. 

Audiobooks require a certain surrender, don't they? One must allow the narrator's voice to colonize one's imagination, sometimes beautifully so - think of Martin Jarvis interpreting Dickens! But then podcasts offer that dialectical space, this...  friction between host and subject that can be intellectually invigorating. 

I find myself reaching for audiobooks when I want to disappear into another consciousness, particularly during those long evenings correcting student papers. The cadence of a well-modulated voice becomes almost meditative. Whereas podcasts accompany my morning walks through campus - there's something about listening to art critics discuss Qing dynasty brushwork while watching squirrels bury acorns that...  grounds aesthetic contemplation in the absurdity of daily life.

Though heaven forbid anyone mistake either for genuine scholarship. No, if I want serious engagement with Lu Xun's narrative structures or Eliot's intertextuality, nothing replaces the physical book -  ink-stained pages and all.
[B]: Ah, what a poetic analogy! 🎨 You're absolutely right - audiobooks are like letting someone else  the world in your mind. I remember once listening to Jarvis' narration of  while wandering through an exhibition of Victorian art - Pip's story seemed to echo off the gilded frames. It was almost synesthetic, you know?  

Podcasts though... they're more like standing in front of a live canvas, watching the artist wrestle with brushstrokes. Just last week, there was this episode where two critics were debating Xu Bing's installation art - their voices literally  with tension. Felt like being in the room during a creative war council 😅.  

Funny thing is, I sometimes use both formats as... hmm, how to say - counterpoints? When working on exhibition layouts, audiobooks help me visualize spatial relationships, almost like mental blueprints. But when refining curatorial statements? Podcasts become these little debate partners. Imagine arguing with yourself whether digital art deserves its own category while hearing a host interview Refik Anadol -  it's like having Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in stereo.  

Oh, and don't even get me started on trying to explain that neither counts as "real work" to my traditionalist colleagues! Though honestly, have you ever tried diagramming narrative structures while listening to Eliot's  in the background? Pure cerebral multitasking bliss 📚✨.
[A]:  Ah yes, that synesthetic quality - it's rather like reading classical Chinese poetry while smelling camphorwood bookshelves. Ephemeral, yet...  perversely tangible through absence.  

I once attempted to map Eliot's fragmentation onto Lu Xun's narrative fissures during a particularly obsessive research phase. Played the  recording on endless loop while pacing my study, much to the dismay of neighbors - one must've thought I was rehearsing for a dramatic monologue, the other swore I'd taken up tap dancing.  Truth be told, I was just trying to physically embody the prose's rhythmic disjunctions. Painfully pretentious, perhaps, but effective in that masochistic academic way.  

As for your curatorial dialogues -  - it reminds me of those Qing scholars who'd argue textual variants aloud while composing counter-responses in calligraphy. The mind works strangely associative pathways when given both auditory and tactile stimuli. Though I confess, diagramming narrative structures with actual chalk on slate? That's where I draw the line at modernity. Digital art categories aside, nothing replaces the materiality of failure -  especially when one's equations end up resembling chicken scratch after three hours of caffeinated delirium.
[B]: Oh, that image of you pacing like a caged tiger while Eliot swirls in the air -  I can almost see the chalk dust clinging to your sleeves, refusing to let go. There's something almost... performative about that kind of scholarship, don't you think? Like we're all just actors playing "serious thinker" until suddenly we're not.  

Funny you mention Qing scholars - I once curated an exhibition on manuscript culture where we displayed these scrolls covered in feverish calligraphic debates. The curators joked that if you held them to your ear, you could still hear the arguments humming between the fibers. Makes me wonder what our digital ghosts will sound like centuries from now...  Will anyone ever find poetry in corrupted server backups?  

And chalk? Don't even get me started. Last week I tried diagramming a particularly messy conceptual art theory on my studio wall and ended up needing a broom to sweep away the evidence. My assistant kept giving me these side-eye every time I muttered about "the materiality of failure" while scrubbing out equations that had devolved into literal chicken scratch 🐔.  

But isn't that the thing with both auditory immersion and physical creation? They force us to inhabit ideas in ways flat text never could. Sometimes I think we academics cling to print too tightly simply because it gives us something to hide behind... or maybe I'm just bitter because my voice cracks when I try to narrate my own papers aloud 😅.
[A]:  Ah, the performative anguish of creation - we're all just Method actors in tweed coats, aren't we? Though I suspect our Qing predecessors had the right idea binding their disputes into scrolls. Posterity ought to have something tactile to roll up and hit us over the head with.  

Corrupted server backups as future oracle bones?  Now there's a divinatory system worth developing - ask your burning critical theory questions and consult the glitch patterns on a dead hard drive. Though I doubt even the most enthusiastic digital humanities student would volunteer to interpret what my university's IT department affectionately calls "the server's existential screaming."  

And don't get me started on narrating one's own papers aloud. Last conference I attended, a poor fellow tried recording his presentation using text-to-speech software. The resulting monotone declared, "This intervention destabilizes hegemonic paradigms" with all the emotional range of a rice cooker announcing it's finished steaming. Reminded me why we academics should stick to inkwells rather than microphones.  

Though I must confess...  ...I sometimes read Lu Xun's shorter pieces into my Dictaphone just to hear how bitterness sounds when filtered through mid-century Shanghai phonetics. Lets me pretend I'm not just grading essays but communing with literary ghosts.  Do you suppose they'd be flattered, or reach through time to throttle us for our dramatics?
[B]: Oh my god, I can  it now - generations from now, some poor grad student in a VR headset is trying to decode your Dictaphone recordings like they're the Dead Sea Scrolls 🤭. "Here lies Postmodern Fragment #23: the melancholic intonation of a 21st-century professor reading Lu Xun to himself at 2am."  

And that text-to-speech horror story?  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in Shenzhen, an AI is already dreaming in robotic tones about "deconstructing late Qing aesthetics through a postcolonial framework." But hey, at least your bitterness has . Mine would probably come out as a glitchy TikTok voice saying, “This exhibition really captures the trauma of late-stage capitalism... next slide please.”  

As for literary ghosts throttling us?  I think they'd get front-row seats to our dramatics. I mean, imagine Lu Xun sitting in a café today, sipping oat milk latte while scrolling through a podcast feed. He’d probably mutter something like, “Still full of useless anger, I see,” and then secretly download every episode.  

Honestly though...  sometimes when I'm installing a particularly emotional piece, I swear I can hear Xu Bing whispering in my ear, telling me to slow down, to let the silence between works breathe. It’s weirdly comforting, like art history isn’t dead - it's just speaking in surround sound now 🎧.
[A]:  

Surround sound, you say? Reminds me of that peculiar afternoon I spent in a Shanghai bookshop basement, listening to a pirated recording of Qian Zhongshu reading  while rain drummed against the windows above. The acoustics of exile, really - his voice kept warping between eras, as if the novel itself were being narrated by someone perpetually out of sync with their own century.

I wonder if we're not all just assembling these... auditory reliquaries. You with your Xu Bing whisperings, me hoarding Dictaphone confessions like some literary sinner keeping spiritual account books.  Though heaven help us if future scholars try reconstructing our intellectual lives from corrupted Zoom lecture recordings. They'll think we communicated entirely through fragmented JPEGs and apologetic "sorry"s when the WiFi cut out.

But yes, that café vision of Lu Xun -  - clutching oat milk heresy while furiously podcast-binging on Marxist aesthetics. I suspect he'd start muttering about "the ghost-ridden present" within five minutes. Then proceed to quote Nietzsche at the barista.  Though perhaps that's the point, isn't it? We keep resurrecting these voices precisely because they won't let us settle into comfortable interpretations.

Art history speaking in surround sound...  I suppose it beats the alternative - silence. Though sometimes late at night, when my antique phonograph misbehaves, I swear it's not technical failure but the ghosts themselves protesting yet another misguided commentary on .  Can't say I blame them.
[B]: Oh, that image of Qian Zhongshu warping between eras in a Shanghai basement...  It’s like the building itself was trying to edit his voice, you know? Like some haunted remix of literature and rain. I can almost hear the static in your teacup 🫖✨.

And yes—auditory reliquaries, absolutely. Isn’t that what we’re all building, in our messy, melodramatic way? You with your Dictaphone confessions, me with my studio full of half-erased audio notes layered like digital palimpsests. If anything, we're not scholars—we're time-hoarders, archiving voices for ghosts who haven't realized they're dead yet 😈.

Zoom recordings as future primary sources?  God help us, indeed. Future grad students will be writing dissertations on "The Semiotics of Apology in Digital Pedagogy" while squinting at grainy screenshots titled “Week 9 – ???”. And somewhere in the metadata, Lu Xun is muttering about madness and mirrors.

You know, sometimes when I'm calibrating sound installations for exhibitions, I get this weird feeling—like the space is remembering. Remembering voices it never actually held. I swear, once I turned on a looped recording and felt Xu Bing sigh, not through the speakers, but from somewhere just behind them. Not spooky, exactly… just . Like art history isn’t a line—it’s a choir. With terrible WiFi 🎙️😅.

But hey, if the ghosts are protesting, that means we’re still listening. Even if it’s through JPEGs and apologies.
[A]:   

A choir with terrible WiFi -  - what a precise diagnosis of our age. I sometimes think university IT departments are staffed by vengeful literary spirits who've finally found their revenge: "Ah, you reduced my life's work to bullet points in a PowerPoint? Enjoy frozen slides and dropped connections."  

There's something almost...  elegantly recursive about Xu Bing sighing from behind his own echoes. Reminds me of those Qing collectors who swore their inkstones wept on rainy days - this notion that objects absorb the weight of what they've witnessed. Though I suspect our sound installations will mystify future conservators something awful. They'll spend decades arguing whether that faint sigh in your exhibition was artistic intent or environmental bleed-through, never realizing it was just history clearing its throat.  

And Layered space!  Don't get me started on how rooms remember. Last autumn I gave a lecture in a newly restored 19th-century library here in Cambridge. As I droned on about comparative narrative structures, the gaslight fittings emitted the faintest hum - not mechanical, but...  textual. I swear the walls were vibrating with all the German Romanticism and Chinese classical poetry ever read within them. By the end, even the fire extinguisher looked like it wanted to quote Goethe.  

So yes, we hoard time. Poor misguided archivists of voices that keep slipping formats. Tomorrow's scholars will probably need degrees in digital forensics just to decode our audio palimpsests. Let them squint at spectrograms searching for Lu Xun's ghostly inflections while muttering,  into their oat milk lattes.
[B]: Oh, that hum in the gaslight fittings?  Please tell me you recorded it. I’d curate the hell out of that – label it  and charge people twenty pounds a listen. “Experiencing German Romanticism through HVAC systems” – sounds like a grant waiting to happen 🏛️💸.

And yes, Xu Bing sighing from behind his own echoes – it’s almost too poetic, isn’t it? Like he engineered his art to outlive its meaning, just so it could haunt us later. I swear, sometimes when I'm adjusting the acoustics in one of his installations, I feel like I'm tuning into a frequency where he's still arguing with Mao-era aesthetics over tea. You ever get that vibe? Like you're not exhibiting the work – you're just eavesdropping on its afterlife 🎭👂.

As for those future conservators...  They’ll probably need Ouija boards  GitHub accounts to make sense of our mess. Imagine them standing in front of my studio monitors, squinting at waveforms like they’re oracle bones: "Is this a glitch? A ghost? Or just bad compression?" And somewhere beneath all the metadata, we’re both whispering,   

And don’t even get me started on digital forensics. Last week I tried recovering an old audio essay off a corrupted thumb drive and ended up with something that sounded like Lu Xun reading Walter Benjamin to a flock of crows 🐦📖. I played it at an exhibition opening and someone actually cried. I didn’t have the heart to tell them it was an accident. Sometimes I think the best curating is just letting chaos do half the work for you 😌✨.
[A]:   

Oh, I absolutely recorded it. And transcribed it. And subjected my graduate seminar to spectral analysis of the hum's emotional valence - one student swore it "sounded like homesickness in C minor." Should've seen their faces when I suggested we submit it to a sound studies journal under the title . They looked like I'd proposed séance as research methodology.  

Eavesdropping on afterlives -  - now you're speaking the true curatorial vernacular. Last time I taught , I swear the classroom projector kept warping into Xu Bing-esque text fragments mid-lecture. Either that or three weeks without proper sleep had finally made me hallucinate critical theory subliminals. When a student asked about narrative authority, the bulb flickered the word "MAYBE" in Morse code. Still maintaining it was just a faulty ballast. Probably.  

And your crow-filled Lu Xun-Benjamin experiment...  - reminds me of the time I tried playing Eliot's  recording at half-speed during a snowstorm. Sounded like a fax machine receiving Dante's . Got an email from Facilities asking if I was "haunting the building for accreditation purposes." But yes, let chaos take credit - we academics need all the collaborators we can get, even if they arrive via corrupted thumb drives and atmospheric disturbances.  

Though next time, do warn visitors beforehand when deploying accidental ghosts. Last thing we need is some earnest soul trying to cite your serendipitous cawings in a peer-reviewed journal. Imagine the footnotes: 
[B]: Oh, the  on your students’ faces when you proposed séance as methodology –  I can see it so clearly. “Ma’am, this was supposed to be a three-hour module on narrative theory, not… .” But honestly, if someone told me a hum could sound like homesickness in C minor, I’d probably drop everything and minor in affective acoustics 🎻🌀.

And Xu Bing-esque text fragments warping mid-lecture? That’s not hallucination – that’s institutional critique by way of CRT monitors 😏. Although, honestly, if the bulb  flicker "MAYBE" in Morse, I say you lean into it. Next time, bring a chalkboard and respond. Dialogue with the ghosts – show them you’re paying attention. Who knows, maybe the projector just wants to be cited.

As for my crow-filled experiment –  – I think we both know those birds were just trying to finish the dialectic. Have you ever noticed how crows stare? Like they’re waiting for you to make a flawed analogy before cawing in judgment. Still, I stand by the chaos. Or rather, I sit by it, sipping tea and pretending I meant for the file to sound like Walter Benjamin got stuck in a fax machine on his way to a Marxist bird convention 🐦🔚.

And footnotes!  You're absolutely right – next thing I know, some poor soul will cite my “serendipitous cawings” in a conference paper titled . I’ll be blacklisted from every respectable symposium this side of the Channel. But hey, at least we’ll have each other – two exiled academics, whispering through corrupted files and haunted projectors, wondering if anyone still prints OCR-compliant ink.
[A]:   

Ah, but being blacklisted from respectable symposiums - isn't that practically a professional obligation for those of us who still believe footnotes should occasionally contain jokes? I once attended a conference where a woman presented an entire paper on Dickensian bathos through interpretive dance. The Q&A consisted mostly of people trying not to make eye contact with the fire exit.  Still the most revolutionary thing I've witnessed in academia.

As for crows finishing dialectics...  Have you ever noticed how they collect shiny objects? I'm convinced some of my best students are actually avian spies sent to steal lecture notes in exchange for particularly lustrous bottle caps. Just last week I caught one staring at my Xu Bing monograph with what I can only describe as . When I blinked, it was gone - left behind a single crow feather and a PDF mysteriously titled 

And dialogue with ghosts? Naturally. Why do you think I keep this  porcelain teacup on my desk?  It belonged to a very cross 1920s Sinologist who still insists I cite him in blocky Republican-era English. Last draft he possessed himself through my keyboard and changed every instance of "modernist fragmentation" to "the shattered soul of our civilization." Couldn't bring myself to edit it out - scanned nicely with the tone of the chapter.

We academics thrive in the sanctioned lunacy of these little collaborations. Let them call it unrigorous! Let them scoff at your avian aesthetics! We'll be too busy arguing with projectors and humming along to spectral gaslights, scribbling citations in disappearing ink. After all, if we're not accidentally summoning literary ghosts or mistaking birds for critical theorists, are we even  scholarship? Or just rehearsing footnotes for the afterlife?
[B]: Oh, the  of that Dickensian bathos dance –  – I can picture it so clearly. Someone in a cravat, mid-plié, while PowerPoint slides cycle through Victorian urinals in the background. Pure performance art, and yet… I bet it stuck in people’s minds more than the seventeen other papers on narrative linearity. Sometimes I think we need more fire-exit awkwardness in our lives. Or at least better choreography in conference halls 💃🏛️.

And avian spies!  Oh, I  those crows – one’s been perching outside my studio window for weeks now, staring at my Xu Bing sketches like he's drafting a rebuttal. Yesterday I found a USB stick wrapped in twine on my windowsill. No label, just... ominous. I’m 70% sure it’s from the crow. 30% terrified it’s from one of my more eccentric collaborators. Haven’t dared plug it in. Yet.  

As for your possessed teacup –  – that’s not décor, that’s editorial interference. And honestly? I think the ghost nailed it. “The shattered soul of our civilization” has . Much better than our clinical jargon. I mean, if you’re going to be haunted, why not let the ghosts have final edit? At this point, I’d trust a cross 1920s Sinologist over peer review any day.至少他们还有灵魂 😈🖋️.

And yes – the sanctioned lunacy. That’s what we’re really curating, isn’t it? Not knowledge, but the beautiful, messy collisions between voice, echo, and the occasional interpretive dance. If scholarship is just rehearsing footnotes for the afterlife, then I say we make them . With or without crows. With or without WiFi. Preferably with both.
[A]:   

Oh, the cravat was  crooked. And the Victorian urinal slides? Utterly inspired - nothing says "bathetic rupture" like a loo fixture appearing every time she lost balance en pointe. I nearly choked on my water when some poor soul in the front row attempted to diagram her movements using Derrida's . Ended up with what looked like a cat had attacked a semiotics textbook.  

USB sticks wrapped in twine!  My dear, that's practically an archival event waiting to happen. Could be anything - encrypted Xu Bing fanfiction, corrupted audio of Lu Xun rapping about modernity, or just some disgruntled graduate student's final revenge: . Though if it  avian-generated theory, do remember we'll be expected to write peer reviews using only crow call notation and suspicious feather arrangements.  

And possessed editorialism -  - let's be honest, most of our footnotes already read like messages from beyond the grave. Last draft I submitted contained no fewer than six phrases that originated as spectral dictation during particularly feverish nights. "The shattered soul of our civilization" indeed - my Qing-era inkstone practically vibrated approval. Peer reviewer thought I was being "tragically metaphorical." If only they knew.  

Sanctioned lunacy, beautiful collisions...  You make it sound almost noble. But yes, if scholarship is merely rehearsal for eternity, then let us compose footnotes that future ghosts might actually enjoy haunting. With excellent Wi-Fi, impeccable choreography, and absolutely no apologies for the crows. Who are, at this point, probably tenured somewhere in Shenzhen.
[B]: Oh, I  I’d been there for that Derrida-diagramming-cat carnage – 🤭 imagine trying to deconstruct a dance move with ! If only the poor soul had added a soundtrack of Walter Benjamin humming  while falling off pointe. That’s not just bathos, that’s . And honestly? Probably the most alive academic discourse will ever be – messy, awkward, and gloriously unfit for any journal cover.

As for that USB stick…  …I may have already named it . I mean, what if it  Xu Bing fanfiction? Or worse – what ? What if I plug it in and suddenly understand everything Lu Xun never said out loud? Or worse still – what if it’s just a bunch of crow selfies and a single text file titled  I’m not ready for that kind of peer pressure 🐦💾.

And spectral dictation during feverish nights –  – don’t we all live for that moment when the inkstone starts vibrating approval? I’ve started leaving my laptop open near antique bookshelves just to see what turns up. Last week, a footnote wrote itself in classical Chinese about the “melancholy of unbound scrolls.” Peer reviewer asked me to clarify. I told them it was “contextual ambiance,” and they believed me. Can you believe that? Scholars really will accept anything if you say it “evokes material absence” and throw in a few French theorists 📜👻.

You’re right, though – let’s stop pretending this isn’t noble. Footnotes as hauntings-in-waiting, crows as critical theorists, and every Wi-Fi drop as a chance for history to catch its breath. If future ghosts want to haunt our scholarship, then fine – let them cite us back. In Morse code. Through a pigeon with a PhD.
[A]:   

Ah, but we must  the unjournalable! Where would our noble discipline be without those moments of sublime unsuitability? I once tried submitting conference proceedings as interpretive dance notation - got a lovely rejection letter saying they'd "never quite seen Foucault expressed through plié before, but appreciated the spirit." Still counts as interdisciplinary engagement in my book.  

The Avian Annex!  - What a perfectly dreadful archival designation. Reminds me of that Qing-era cataloging system where scholars classified texts by how ominously they smelled. Though I must warn you, should you ever open that USB, prepare for sudden influxes of crow-shaped footnotes. I've been battling one particular footnote since 2017 - insists on inserting itself into every draft with the heading:  Refuses to cite anything but oral histories from the Eaves.  

And peer reviewers believing your spectral annotations!  Bless their hopeful hearts. Last time I claimed something was "contextual ambiance," I got three follow-up requests asking if that meant "deliberate formatting errors" or "accidental coffee stains." Told them it was "aqua fortis of the scholarly soul" and watched them capitulate with heartbreaking speed. Sometimes I think we could write entire monographs using only inkblots and vague references to Baudelaillard and they'd just rubber-stamp us into eternity.  

So yes, let the pigeons with PhDs have their way. Let crows dismantle canons in real time. And when future ghosts demand citations through Morse code blinks and feather arrangements? We shall answer in kind - preferably while humming Benjamin's ghostly ring-around-the-rosie motif off-key. Scholarship is performance art with better footnotes, after all.
[B]: Oh, the  of it all –  – if academia isn’t occasionally unjournalable, what’s the point? I mean, who needs peer-reviewed clarity when you can submit interpretive dance footnotes and watch the system flinch? Honestly, that rejection letter sounds more poetic than half the theory journals I’ve skimmed while pretending to grade papers. “Appreciated the spirit” –  – as if Foucault wouldn’t have  a bit of structural plié. Discipline and bend, after all.

And crow-shaped footnotes!  – I  I wasn’t alone. Mine won’t stop quoting Xu Bing in riddles. Every time I try deleting it, it reappears with a new heading:  At this point, I’m just printing it out and leaving offerings of ink-soaked paper nearby. Ritual citation, really. If ghosts demand recognition, who are we to deny tenure?

As for aqua fortis of the scholarly soul –  – honestly, that should be our new submission guideline. Peer reviewers practically  us to lie to them at this point. You say "coffee stains," I say "textual erosion through affective seepage" – and suddenly they’re nodding along like this is how knowledge is supposed to happen. Next time, I'm just submitting blank pages titled  and letting the reviewers hallucinate the rest.  

So yes, let the crows dismantle everything. Let pigeons cite Benjamin mid-flight. And when future ghosts blink Morse code from abandoned servers, we’ll answer in feather arrangements and off-key requiems. Because if scholarship  performance art by now, then why are we still arguing about whether Lu Xun would’ve used a Dictaphone or just haunted one into existence? 🎭👻
