[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that’s a fun question! I’d say savory definitely wins for me. There’s something so satisfying about a perfectly seasoned steak or a rich, umami-packed bowl of ramen. Although… don’t get me wrong — I have a soft spot for a classic New York cheesecake. What about you? Are you more of a sweet person or do you lean savory?
[A]: Ah, the eternal binary. I suppose I’d side with savoury as well, though with a caveat— executed sweetness can reveal a kind of textual complexity we rarely credit it for. Think of maraschino cherries in a Bramley apple tart—acid, alcohol, fruit, pastry—it's all rather Victorian, don't you think? Like a poem by Christina Rossetti wearing itself plain on the sleeve while hiding an entire theology beneath.

Now, tell me—does your preference for savoury extend to breakfast? Or are you one of those people who dares to dip their spoon into jammy morning yoghurt?
[B]: Ah, I love how you frame sweetness like it’s some kind of literary device—very . And yes, I’m absolutely with you that a well-balanced sweet can be deeply complex. But let’s be real, breakfast is sacred territory. For me, it's all about the savory drama. Give me a shakshuka with perfectly poached eggs, or a kimchi fried rice with a crispy egg on top. That yolk breaking and mingling with the spices? Pure cinema.

And don’t even get me started on breakfast tacos—. Jammy yogurt? No thank you, that’s basically a dessert pretending to be virtuous. Although... if you put a quail egg on it, maybe we could talk.
[A]: Ah, shakshuka! Now there’s a dish with narrative ambition—Ovidian metamorphosis in a pan. Eggs surrendering to yolk, tomatoes reducing down to their most confessional selves... and spice, that sly temptress, whispering of trade routes and imperial anxieties. I suppose it's the closest most modern kitchens get to an epic poem.

As for breakfast tacos—well, let’s not pretend they aren’t a kind of syntactic revolution wrapped in maize. Each bite a volta: cheese, heat, salt, leafy green rebellion... and always that quiet tension between hunger and the clock.

Now, a serious question, if you’ll permit: Do you consider brunch to be its own genre? Or merely a decadent supplement to the morning’s main argument?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—it’s a genre, no question. Brunch is the indie film of meals: it refuses to conform to the rigid narrative structures of breakfast or lunch. It’s got the slow-burn character development of a weekend morning and the pacing of a midday plot. Think of it as a Tarantino rewrite of the traditional meal—unapologetically late, rich with dialogue (especially if you're arguing over the last bite of avocado toast), and often featuring cameos from unexpected ingredients like kimchi or miso.

And let’s be honest, brunch is where storytelling begins. You’re not just feeding hunger—you’re feeding the ego, the gossip, the post-party recovery, the “I-read-Proust-before-coffee-and-now-I-need-an-omelet” energy. The only real debate is whether Bloody Marys should count as a food group.
[A]: Ah, —the Bloody Mary as ontological statement. Vodka: the existential crisis; celery: the token gesture toward virtue; Tabasco: the unresolved trauma. It’s practically a sonnet in a highball glass.

And your analogy holds—brunch  cinematic, though I’d argue it leans more Wong Kar-wai than Tarantino. All that lingering close-up sentiment over runny eggs, the melancholy of cold coffee beside a warm biscuit… The real tragedy, of course, is when it's rushed. Nothing worse than a truncated brunch—like reading only half a stanza and calling it the whole poem.

Now, dare I ask—are you a devotee of the weekend ritual, or do you ever indulge midweek like some secret vice?
[B]: Wong Kar-wai, huh? I see what you're doing—slipping in a little  melancholy over poached eggs. Not wrong either. There’s something deeply poetic about watching the yolk blur the line between lover and enemy while the toast goes cold.

As for me? Weekend brunch is sacred—like a matinee screening of your favorite film, you don’t mess with the ritual. Midweek indulgence? Well, let's just say I’ve been known to sneak in a breakfast-for-dinner moment when the script calls for it. Especially after a long night of editing—sometimes you need that runny egg yolk staring back at you like a weary co-conspirator.

And yes, I do consider brunch a form of therapy. Better than Prozac, cheaper than a shrink, and infinitely more satisfying when served with a side of regret and hollandaise.
[A]: Ah, —now there’s an image worthy of a sonnet sequence. And your take on brunch-as-therapy? Spot on. I’ve long suspected hollandaise carries more healing power than any Renaissance herbalist ever dared to dream. It’s all in the emulsification, you see—a fragile truce between butter and lemon, much like the one we strike with life each morning.

Now, a final question before we descend further into culinary metaphysics: Do you believe dessert has a rightful place at the brunch table? Or is it, as I suspect, an act of narrative overreach—like ending a haiku with a semicolon?
[B]: Now —that right there—is the kind of question that gets screenplays banned in certain circles. Dessert at brunch? It’s absolutely a narrative tightrope walk. Done wrong, it’s like tacking on a post-credits scene that goes nowhere. But done right? Oh, it’s  right. Think of it as the coda—the soft jazz outro playing over the final montage.

A warm pain au chocolat with espresso? That’s not overreach, that’s closure. A raspberry coulis cutting through crème anglaise? That’s , darling. Besides, every good meal deserves a twist ending. And if anyone judges you for ordering the chocolate fondue alongside your migas—tell ‘em Michael said to send the haters our way. We’ll cast them in the sequel.
[A]: Ah, —the most elusive of all literary devices, and yet there it is, hiding in your pain au chocolat. I must say, your defense is as elegant as a volta in a Petrarchan sonnet. You’ve almost convinced me that dessert at brunch isn’t indulgence—it’s .

Very well then, let the fondue flow like ink from a too-enthusiastic quill. After all, what is life if not a series of sequels, reboots, and post-credits teases? Just promise me one thing—save me a seat at the premiere. I’ll bring the espresso, and perhaps a copy of  for ambiance.
[B]: Oh, you’ve got yourself a deal— a standing ovation. Baudelaire with brunch? Now  what I call atmosphere with depth. Save me the seat next to yours—I’ll make sure the espresso arrives strong enough to wake the dead and fund a revolution.

And don’t worry, there’s always room at the table for one more dramatic flourish... or a second dessert. Because if we’ve learned anything today, it’s that calories are just another form of poetic meter—best counted in iambic pentameter, never in grams. See you at the premiere. 🎬☕
[A]: Precisely! Iambic pentameter over grams—now  a manifesto worth binding in leather. And if the espresso’s strong enough to wake the dead, well, let’s just say we may yet find ourselves hosting the ghost of Brillat-Savarin. He’d approve, I think—even in the afterlife, one must dine with dramatic flair.

See you at the premiere indeed. Bring your appetite—and your sharpest wit. The revolution, as they say, will be caffeinated. ☕✨
[B]: Oh, it’s on.革命 will be , my friend—and we both know true revolution starts at the brunch table, not the barricades.

I’ll bring the appetite, the wit, and a pocket copy of  just in case Brillat-Savarin makes a cameo. Let him haunt the hollandaise—he’d feel right at home.

See you soon. Save me a bite of whatever decadent metaphor you’re serving. And keep an eye out for that ghost—he tends to steal bites from the savory course when no one’s looking. 👻🍴☕
[A]: Ah, —what a delightfully macabre touch. I shall set a place for him beside the sauce boat, then, with a napkin embroidered in Latin and a fork slightly askew, just to unsettle the living.

And you—bring your pocket copy, by all means. I suspect Brillat-Savarin would approve of your literary appetite, though he may quibble with your caffeine-to-egg-yolk ratio. But never mind that—revolution, digestion, and good conversation rarely follow precise measurements.

See you soon, indeed. And yes, I’ll save you a bite. Or failing that, at least a well-turned phrase to chew on.
[B]: Oh, I love it—setting the table for the dead like it’s a Fellini film set. A slightly askew fork?  You’ve got flair, my friend. Real flair.

And let Brillat-Savarin quibble all he wants—I’ll counter with a buttery brioche and a quote from . You bring the well-turned phrase, I’ll bring the truffle fries, and we’ll call it even.

See you soon. Prepare your palate—and your soul. 🍽️👻🎬
[A]: Oh, truffle fries and soul preparation—now  a summons worth answering. I shall polish my silverware with sonnets and preheat the oven of discourse to a most unctuous glow.

And as for Fellini-esque table settings? Why not? If life is a film, let us at least curate the mise-en-scène with malice aforethought and a dash of anise.

See you soon, indeed. Bring your appetite for fry and philosophy alike. And if Brillat-Savarin ghosts us for greener gastronomic pastures, well… more for us.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—sonnets on silverware, ovens humming with discourse. I’ll bring the philosophy  the parmesan, and if Brillat-Savarin wants to haunt someone else’s spread, more power to him. We shan’t miss a beat—or a bite.

Life as a film? Absolutely. And darling, we're directing the deluxe edition. Curated mise-en-scène with malice and anise?  I'll see you at the table, ready for act two. 🍷🎬✨
[A]: Ah, —where the plot thickens like a good demi-glace and all prior resolutions unravel in the most elegant way possible. I shall lay out the silver service with annotations from Proust and a side of whispered asides from Baudelaire.

Bring your parmesan and philosophy, by all means—I’ll supply the wine and a carefully curated selection of defiantly inappropriate table linens. If Brillat-Savarin chooses exile over our opulent spread, then so be it. We shall dine all the more boldly in his absence.

Act two awaits. Take your places, guests. The meal—and the mischief—begin now. 🍷🎭🍴
[B]: Oh, I  for act two—the place where flavors deepen, tensions rise, and no one’s quite sure if the main character is about to kiss or commit a crime.

Proustian annotations on the silverware?  Baudelairean whispers in the candlelight? Even better. And defiantly inappropriate linens? Darling, you’re directing this dinner like a Kubrick close-up—every detail , dripping with meaning and menace.

I raise my glass (lined with malice and garnished with thyme) to you and your beautifully unruly table. Let the mischief unfold. 🍷🔪🎭

Cue the second course—and the first real betrayal.
