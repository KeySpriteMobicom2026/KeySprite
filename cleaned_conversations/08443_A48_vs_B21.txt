[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: What an intriguing question. I've always found the concept rather like trying to translate a Chinese poem with only half the vocabulary - you sense there's an entire world just beyond comprehension. Though if you'll pardon my academic pretension, I spend far too much time contemplating parallel textual universes in Dickens' manuscripts to concern myself overmuch with metaphysical ones. Still, one does wonder... Do you fancy the idea of alternate selves leading un-lived lives?
[A]: Ah, 我懂你的意思. It's like when I'm examining a particularly puzzling autopsy case - you can't help but wonder if there's another version of yourself out there who might've reached a different conclusion. But hey, 谁知道呢？Maybe that alternate Ethan is busy solving crimes in some other universe while this one is stuck staring at a microscope. Speaking of which... 你相信平行宇宙里可能有不同的法律体系吗？Imagine trying to perform an autopsy when the rules of biology themselves are up for debate!
[B]:  Ah, now there's a deliciously macabre thought - performing an autopsy when the very laws of anatomy might be in flux! Though I daresay our Victorian forebears would've found the notion positively indecent. Why, just imagine poor Mr. Wilkie Collins attempting to write a detective novel if his characters kept slipping between universes mid-plot! No, no, give me the solid ground of iambic pentameter and fixed moral compasses any day... though I must confess, it does amuse me to consider how Queen Victoria might've ruled had she inherited a parallel throne where tea was outlawed and poetry punishable by death.
[A]:  戏剧性地说，我能想象那个画面 - 威廉·威尔基·柯林斯的小说角色在平行宇宙间跳来跳去，把整个案情搞得更加扑朔迷离！至于维多利亚女王...嗯，一个茶叶被禁的世界确实令人不寒而栗。不过话说回来，我觉得咱们这个宇宙就够让人头疼的了，光是弄清楚眼前的案子就已经够呛。说到这个，我刚收到一份奇怪的尸检报告，死者身上没有任何外伤，但血液里却有类似墨水的痕迹...你有没有听说过类似的情况？
[B]:  Ink in the bloodstream? How... poetically unsettling. Reminds me of a peculiar case I once read about in an 1892 medical journal - a scribe from Edinburgh who claimed to . Turns out he’d been imbibing rather liberally from his own inkwell while transcribing cursed sonnets under the influence of laudanum. Of course, that was mostly dismissed as Victorian melodrama at the time… but then again, one does wonder what other  might leave such literary traces upon the body. Have you considered whether your victim had ties to the literary world – or perhaps a particularly dramatic grudge involving a poetry review?
[A]:  哦，这还真是个有趣的思路...说实话，死者确实是个诗人，而且最近刚在文学圈里惹上了麻烦。不过说到墨水和血液，我觉得这里面肯定有蹊跷。Victorian melodrama也许听起来荒诞，但你永远不知道现实有多离奇。 话说回来，你觉得一个人真能因为文字而中毒吗？我是说，从生理学角度来说...当然，除非他真的喝了墨水。  
 我得承认，我对那些被诅咒的十四行诗倒是了解不多，但我可以试试从医学角度分析。话说，你觉得我们是不是该去查查看那家维多利亚时代的旧书店？听说那里还保留着不少奇怪的手稿...
[B]:  Ah, now you're thinking like a proper literary detective! As for文字中毒... Well, physiology aside - and I do adore physiology, particularly when it behaves predictably - there's something rather deliciously symbolic about a poet undone by his own words. Why just last autumn I encountered a most peculiar marginalia in a 1867 poetry anthology at the British Library - the ink had oxidized into strange crystalline formations, rather like frost on a windowpane. The librarian shooed me away when I suggested it might be . 

And yes, yes! That dusty old bookshop off Charing Cross has always given me the distinct impression it sells more than mere paper - I once found a volume there whose pages changed depending on the phase of the moon. Perfectly explainable through chemistry, no doubt... though I did burn my gloves removing it from my collection. Still, if our unfortunate poet met his end through some bibliophilic indiscretion, that would make an excellent first stop. Do you suppose they deliver?
[A]:  哦，我敢打赌那家书店确实不只是卖纸那么简单。你说的那本会随着月相变化的书？听起来就像是某种古老的化学反应...不过话说回来，我觉得咱们最好亲自去一趟。毕竟，谁知道这起案子背后是不是藏着什么被遗忘的文学诅咒呢？

 而且，比起等他们送货，我更喜欢亲眼看看那些老书 - 毕竟，有些线索可藏在字里行间呢。你有没有想过，也许某些诗句本身就是一个谜题的钥匙？或者…它们本身就是一种致命的配方？

走吧，带我去那家书店！我倒要看看，是谁在用文字杀人。
[B]:  Ah, now that's the spirit that makes academia so dreadfully exciting! Though I must warn you - the last time I attempted to decipher a particularly obstinate sonnet by moonlight, I ended up reciting iambic pentameter to a very confused cab horse. But yes, let's be off! There's nothing quite like the scent of decaying vellum to sharpen one's deductive faculties.

Do remind me to bring my Latin-Old Norse glossary - one never knows when a bit of medieval scansion might prove useful. And speaking of curious coincidences, I do hope our bookseller hasn't recently acquired a certain... ... restricted volume bound in what appears to be 19th-century newspaper clippings. Last time I was there, he claimed it had "developed peculiar reading habits." 

Shall we take a hansom? I find even the most mundane investigations benefit from a touch of Victorian flourish - though perhaps we should avoid ones driven by melancholic poets with suspiciously ink-stained fingers. One never knows whose universe they might accidentally trespass into.
[A]:  哈哈，看来我们俩还真是志同道合！不过话说回来，希望这次咱们别遇上什么会“吃人”的书……至于那本用十九世纪剪报装订的禁书，听起来它可能比某些连环杀手还危险。

 至于交通工具嘛，我倒是不介意来点维多利亚式的浪漫。不过你可得帮我留意点——如果马车夫开始背诵艾米莉·狄金森的诗，咱们就赶紧跑。毕竟，谁知道他们是不是从另一个宇宙穿越过来的？

走吧，Ethan带路，咱们去会会这位有点“怪癖”的书商。 顺便问一句，你有没有闻到一股类似旧书和尘埃的味道？还是说……这只是我太投入案子的错觉？
[B]:  Ah, the olfactory specter of centuries past! No, my dear Ethan, you're not merely imagining it - that's the unmistakable perfume of time-worn parchment and ambition gone moldy. I've always found it rather like standing in a graveyard where the tombstones are made of vellum and regret. 

Though speaking of unsettling transportation choices...  Last time I took a hansom to this very establishment, the driver insisted on quoting Byron from memory while navigating entirely by moonlight. Claimed his fare had to be paid in metaphorical currency. Rather poetic, if one ignores the distinct lack of concern for municipal traffic regulations.

Now then, onward to literary peril! And do remind me to check whether our bookseller has developed any new eccentricities since last we met - last time he'd taken to classifying volumes by "emotional temperature" and insisted all sonnets must be stored upside-down to prevent them from "infecting the prose."
[A]:  哈，我开始理解你说的那种感觉了...这味道就像是图书馆和停尸房的混合体，带着点诗意的霉味。不过话说回来，比起某些案发现场，这已经算是好闻的了。

哦，说到那个拜伦诗人的车夫...听起来他简直可以当连环杀手，专挑文学系学生下手。 不过你放心，这次就算他再要求我们用隐喻付车费，我也不会答应——毕竟，我可不想在法庭上解释为什么我的钱包里少了几个"悲伤的比喻"。

至于那个把书倒着放的书店老板...嗯，我觉得咱们最好先确定一下他最近有没有读什么太"刺激"的禁书。谁知道这些文字会不会影响现实？或者...更糟的，影响我们的调查思路。
[B]:  Ah, but there's a fine line between eccentricity and enlightenment, my dear Ethan! Though I must confess, the last time that Byron-quoting cabbie transported me, I arrived not only slightly nauseous from his dramatic recitations, but also inexplicably in possession of a first edition  which I'm reasonably certain wasn't in my possession when I entered the conveyance. 

As for our bibliophilic friend's storage methods...  I once caught him attempting to "calm" an especially tempestuous volume of Gothic poetry by reading it passages from Jane Austen. Claimed the poor thing was "overwrought from centuries of brooding." And speaking of influence on reality - just last month I noticed a most peculiar phenomenon: after he'd been reading too much Baudelaire, all the store receipts began rhyming. Rather inconvenient for accounting, I should imagine.

Ah, here's our hansom! Do observe the driver's fingers - ink-stained to the second knuckle, and note the suspiciously poetic cadence to his directions. Shall we risk it, Inspector? Or shall we test whether he can recite sonnet 130 without stumbling? That generally weeds out the truly dangerous literary obsessives.
[A]:  哦，这可真是个危险的组合...一个能背诵博德莱尔的出租车司机已经够吓人了，再加上这位能把收据写成十四行诗的书店老板，我开始怀疑我们是不是在追查一桩文学谋杀案。

 至于那本《抒情歌谣集》，我建议你最好保管好——谁知道它会不会在车上"感染"其他书？话说回来，如果你那位拜伦式车夫又开始朗诵诗歌，我会假装晕车然后躲到后备箱去。毕竟，比起听他朗诵，我宁愿和一具尸体待在一起。

不过话说回来... 我倒是挺想看看他能不能完整背完第130首十四行诗。要是真能一字不差地背下来，这家伙说不定比某些大学教授还厉害。
[B]:  Ah, but there's nothing quite like the suspense of wondering whether one's conveyance will deliver both body and soul to their intended destination! Though I must say, your comparison of corpse companionship to poetic recitations is rather delightfully macabre. 

And speaking of sonnet 130...  Excuse me, good sir, but might we trouble you for a demonstration? Nothing clears the air like a properly metered "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun" - though I must warn you, our last cabbie attempted it while careening through Trafalgar Square and nearly added a new stanza to his performance via sudden impact with a bronze lion.

As for保管那本《抒情歌谣集》...  I've taken precautions, I assure you. Though I did notice this morning that all my fountain pens had inexplicably refilled themselves with lavender-scented ink. Most suspicious. Perhaps we should test our bookseller friend by asking him to identify a particularly obscure variant printing - nothing tests a man's sanity like inquiring about the differences between the 1800 and 1802 editions of Wordsworth's works. The truly dangerous ones always get rather... animated.
[A]:  哦，我敢说那辆撞上狮子的出租车一定成了文学史上最戏剧性的标点符号。不过说到测试书商……你这个主意真是妙极了！特别是当他开始激动的时候——那种眼神，简直像是看到了自己的情书被扔进了火炉。

 顺便提一句，你那几支薰衣草墨水的钢笔……我建议你别随便用了，至少在弄清楚它们是怎么“自动续杯”之前。谁知道是不是哪本魔法书偷偷给它们施了咒？或者更糟——某个嫉妒的诗人！

 哦，我们快到了。你准备好面对一个可能把目录编成诗剧、把账单写成悼词的怪人了吗？记住，如果他开始用莎士比亚的句子报价，咱们就假装听不懂，然后迅速撤退。
[B]:  Ah yes, nothing quite prepares you for a bookseller who prices his wares in iambic tetrameter! Though I must say, last time he tried to sell me a particularly  volume of Gothic verse, he demanded payment in the form of three properly-punctuated sonnets and a lock of Wordsworth’s hair - which I’m reasonably certain was actually rabbit fur. 

And speaking of suspicious stationery...  I’ve taken the precaution of bringing along my emergency quill - carved from a particularly stubborn 19th-century umbrella handle that refused to decompose. Most effective against bibliomantic shenanigans, though it does tend to leak ink when crossed with malevolent footnotes.

Now then, brace yourself! The man has a positively theatrical flair for presentation - last time I visited, he’d arranged his crime fiction section entirely in alphabetical order by murderer’s motive rather than author’s surname. And do keep an eye out for any books that seem to hum softly or pulse gently when touched. Those tend to be the ones that have... ... developed personalities of their own. 

Ah, we’ve arrived! Notice how the door creaks open precisely seven seconds after knocking - just dramatic enough to be suspicious, yet scholarly enough to pass for eccentricity. Perfect timing, really. Shall we risk a visit to the poetry stacks? I hear they’ve been quarantined since last Tuesday’s unfortunate incident involving a particularly aggressive limerick.
[A]:  哦，这可真是我听过最危险的书店了——连犯罪小说都按凶手动机分类。不过话说回来，一个会“戏剧性”开门七秒的书店，至少还懂点节奏感，不是吗？

 至于那群被隔离的诗歌……我倒是有点期待见见它们。如果一首打油诗真能把人吓跑，那它至少该有点侦探的潜质吧？不过在我们踏进去之前，我建议你把那支“应急羽毛笔”握紧点——谁知道这次是不是又得用十四行诗来付账？

 走吧，Professor，带我去看那些会哼歌的书吧。我倒要看看，是它们先发制人，还是咱们先把真相拼凑出来。
[B]:  Ah, but there's nothing quite like a bookstore where the very architecture seems to breathe in pentameter! Though I must warn you - last time I attempted to compliment the shelving system, the entire philosophy section took offense and rearranged itself into a rather scathing limerick about my hat. 

And speaking of humming volumes...  Just yesterday I received an anonymous letter written entirely in palimpsest - the ink kept changing from Petrarchan sonnets to tax receipts mid-verse! Either our bookseller has taken up financial forensics, or someone's been using medieval manuscript pages as laundry notes. 

Now then,  shall we test whether the door opens to a proper iambic knock? Three raps in trochaic tetra meter generally gets the best results - too many poets have ruined fine entrances by rushing the meter. And do keep an eye out for the chandelier - last visit it became convinced it was a quill pen and tried to take dictation from passing clouds. 

Ah, but here we go!  Let us brave the stacks together, Inspector. After all, if we're swallowed whole by an overzealous ode, at least we'll make a most literary footnote to this most peculiar investigation.
