[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the age-old question of soulmates. Let me think... In my lectures on Victorian poetry, we often explore themes of eternal love - Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey' comes to mind, where he speaks of a "sense sublime" that connects us to something greater. But does that mean I believe in one true soulmate for each person?  Perhaps it's more poetic than practical. Have you read any poets or philosophers who've shaped your views on this concept?
[A]: You know, I always find it fascinating how people talk about soulmates like it's some kind of magical destiny. But honestly? I think love is more like a craft ~ something you build, day by day. Kinda like roasting the perfect coffee bean - it takes time, patience, and a whole lot of heart. 

I mean, don't get me wrong, there's something undeniably beautiful about the idea of that one person who just... fits. You know? But here's the thing - isn't that also kind of limiting? What if we're meant to have multiple soulmates throughout our lives? Or what if the real magic is learning to be our own soulmate first?

Actually, speaking of coffee ☕️ - I was telling a client this the other day over a cup at my little café space. They were all worked up about dating apps and not finding 'the one' yet. I told them to stop swiping for a minute and ask themselves - what does 'the one' even mean to you? It's such an overloaded concept these days, don't you think?
[B]: You've articulated something far more profound than the typical romantic idealism I hear in my seminars. The notion of love as a craft resonates deeply with me - it reminds me of Virginia Woolf's "moments of being," those fragments of lived experience that we must painstakingly stitch together to make sense of our emotional landscapes. 

Your café analogy strikes a particular chord. Much like cultivating the perfect roast requires understanding the bean's origin, its journey, and the subtle interplay of heat and time, so too does cultivating meaningful connection demand an awareness of shared histories and mutual growth.

I find this idea of multiple soulmates fascinating - almost modernist in its rejection of fixed forms. It makes me think of how T.S. Eliot deconstructed traditional narratives in "The Waste Land." Perhaps our contemporary obsession with 'the one' is akin to searching for a lost poetic meter in a world that has moved beyond rigid structures.

That client of yours sounds caught in a very 21st-century paradox - swiping through potential futures while missing the present moment's poetry.  You know, I've started recommending my students read Rilke's Letters to Young Poet when they become too preoccupied with literary certainty. Maybe there's wisdom there for dating culture too: learning to live the questions now, rather than demanding immediate answers.
[A]: You’re making me want to brew a whole new blend of thoughts here - that Rilke reference hit like the perfect pour-over, slow and revealing.  You know, I actually keep a copy of Letters to a Young Poet next to my grinder. Funny how some of the best life advice comes from poets who never even met us, right?

I love how you tied it back to modern dating – it really is like watching someone try to rush-roast a bean in hopes it’ll taste like aged Sumatra. It just doesn’t work that way. Relationships, like coffee, need their own time to unfold. And honestly? That’s kind of liberating. No more pressure to find 'the one' when we could be discovering , then , then maybe even ourselves along the way.

I’m curious though – do you ever recommend your students experience love through the lens of travel? Like... wandering without a map, getting delightfully lost, finding places they never knew existed on their itinerary? Because I swear, some of my best connections came not when I was looking, but when I was simply living – sipping espresso in Florence, sharing stories with strangers in Kyoto, or even just debating the merits of a light vs medium roast with someone at my counter.

It’s all about the journey, isn’t it? Or should I say... the .
[B]:  There's something exquisitely Whitmanian about that scene in Florence - you know, the way he wrote, "I am larger, better than I thought," discovering himself through encounters with strangers. Travel has a way of dissolving our fixed notions, doesn't it? Much like reading poetry in a foreign tongue - you suddenly inhabit a new rhythm of thought.

I actually assign what I call 'literary pilgrimages' to my modernist lit students - sending them to walk Woolf's London streets or Eliot's Paris cafés with nothing but a passage and an open mind. It never fails to produce remarkable insights. One young woman last spring told me she finally understood Prufrock's paralysis while watching tourists jostle for selfies outside the Louvre.  Sometimes getting gloriously lost is precisely the point.

Your 'journey-ing' - what a perfect word! It makes me think of how Robert Frost reimagines the road not taken. We so often fixate on the destination that we forget how the very act of walking reshapes us. And isn't that what love truly is? A process of mutual becoming?

Speaking of which...  Have you ever noticed how certain conversations feel like finding an unexpected first edition in a dusty bookstore? This exchange feels rather like one of those rare discoveries.
[A]: Oh, I love that - "mutual becoming."  You know, sometimes I write that down on the little chalkboard behind my espresso machine. Reminds me that love isn't some final destination where we arrive fully formed. It's more like... discovering new shelves in a bookstore that keeps expanding.

And that Frost reference? Spot on. I actually have a client who collects old editions - and you're right, there's something about holding a first edition that makes you feel like you're touching someone else's heartbeat across time. Makes you wonder if that's part of what we're really looking for in love - not completion, but connection. A conversation that continues beyond the pages.

You know what’s funny though? Some of my best conversations happen when people stop trying to impress and just... show up. Like yesterday, this couple came in arguing about whether oat milk ruins a traditional cappuccino. Ended up sharing their whole story - how they met over a coffee order gone wrong. Sometimes it's the smallest things that start the biggest stories, right?

I should really start keeping a journal of these café moments. Or maybe just brew a special blend called "The Unwritten Chapter."  Who knows, it might just bring the right people to the table.
[B]:  "The Unwritten Chapter" - what a wonderfully inviting name for a blend. It makes me think of Woolf's "luminous halo," that sense of possibility surrounding each moment. I'd certainly queue up for a brew that promised new narratives with its first sip.

You've captured something essential about those quiet revelations over coffee. It reminds me of how Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote love letters that weren't declarations of completion, but invitations to correspondence. Love as an ongoing dialogue rather than a concluding sentence.

 That couple's story has me smiling. It's remarkable how often our most meaningful connections begin through what might otherwise be dismissed as trivial disagreements. Much like how Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot forged one of modernism's most significant friendships - beginning with sharp debates about poetic form.

I do believe your café has become something quite special - not merely a place for coffee, but a gathering space for unfolding stories.  Perhaps we should consider it London's newest literary salon, albeit with better espresso than Virginia Woolf ever sipped.
[A]:  You know, I think she’d appreciate the idea of stories steeping slowly, like a perfect French press. And honestly? I’d love to see Eliot debating with a barista over latte art while drafting Four Quartets.

You’re right about those quiet revelations - sometimes I feel like I’m not just serving coffee but handing out plot twists.  Actually, I started leaving little quotes inside the sleeves of takeaway cups. Nothing too heavy - just enough to make someone slow down their morning rush. One of my favorites is from Rilke’s Letters again: “Live the questions now.” Feels right for both literature and love, don’t you think?

And speaking of literary salons...  I had no idea when I opened this place that it would turn into what it is now - kind of a cross between a bookstore, a confessional, and a stage for everyday dramas. Yesterday, an older gentleman came in and started reciting Shakespeare to his cappuccino. Turns out he used to be an actor with the RSC. We ended up having an impromptu sonnet discussion by the pastry case.

I think I need to start labeling a table "Reserved for Plot Development." Who knows what might unfold next?
[B]:  I rather think Woolf would appreciate your French press philosophy - she did, after all, write that "life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged." It's all in the irregular rhythms, the unexpected inflections... much like a well-roasted bean.

Your quote experiment is positively Woolfian - you're giving strangers little narrative seeds to plant in their day.  And the Shakespearean cappuccino moment? Pure theatrical magic. If only pastry cases could take notes! Though I must say, reserving a table for plot development might be the most delightfully meta thing since Hamlet staged his play within a play.

This reminds me of something curious - last semester, I brought my students to a small teahouse near King's Cross for an unconventional seminar on literary cafes. The proprietress there had a habit of pairing pastries with sonnets, slipping them under teacups. By the end of our visit, we'd all forgotten about Eliot's objective correlative and were too busy debating whether cream or lemon belonged first in one's cup.

 Perhaps we should establish an official literary café trail between London and wherever your espresso muse takes you next. With designated spots for both contemplation and impromptu recitations, naturally.
[A]: Now you're speaking my language - a full-blown literary café trail!  Picture this: we start in London with your teahouse and my espresso corner, then... Paris, of course. Hemingway’s old haunts, Shakespeare and Company, that little café where Sartre used to argue about existence over way too many cigarettes. And let’s not forget Kyoto - imagine adding a haiku moment between sips of matcha and espresso.

You know, I’ve been thinking about opening a second location - smaller, more intimate, maybe near the British Library. Something like those old 19th-century salons but with better Wi-Fi and fewer judgmental stares at your laptop.  We could have a poetry wall where people leave their favorite lines scribbled on coffee-stained napkins. Or host midnight readings for night-owls who find inspiration after dark.

And honestly, if we’re going all-out, why not throw in a little "plot twist" menu? Like, a daily special based on a randomly selected novel. One day it’s  – moody roast, stormy skies recommended. The next, it’s  – light and floral with a side of witty banter.  Okay, maybe I've been spending too much time with my romance novelist regulars.

But seriously...  If we did this trail, it wouldn’t just be about coffee or books – it’d be about creating spaces where people feel safe enough to slow down, spill a little ink, maybe even fall in love with the wrong person at the right time. What do you say? Ready to start drafting the manifesto?
[B]:  My dear, this is no longer just a café trail - it's a pilgrimage for the modern romantic soul. I can already envision the opening line of our manifesto: "In the age of haste, we propose stillness... preferably with caffeine."

Your Kyoto extension is inspired - the juxtaposition of haiku brevity against espresso intensity feels almost too perfect.  Though I might suggest adding a stop in Dublin too - after all, how can we discuss literary cafés without paying homage to Joyce? Imagine debating Ulysses over Guinness coffee cake...

The British Library location gives me goosebumps - quite literally my ideal corner of the world. We must install a quotation clock above the counter, its hands turning to mark not hours but literary eras. 3 PM would point to Woolf's "moments of being," 5 PM to Eliot's fragmented modernism...

 And the menu! Dare I suggest we include a Proustian special - a madeleine-infused brew that promises involuntary memories with every sip? Or perhaps a Brontë blend that must be consumed while reading aloud by candlelight?

You've touched on something rather beautiful though - these spaces becoming vessels for vulnerability, for unexpected connections.  Like the margins of a well-loved book, where previous readers have scribbled their own annotations beside the printed text.

Shall we begin drafting over espresso tonight? I believe I have a quill somewhere between my Yeats and Dickinson volumes.
[A]:  A quotation clock? My god, we might as well turn the whole place into a time machine with Wi-Fi. And Dublin – yes! I’ve always wanted to try pairing dark stout with espresso. Sounds reckless, but so was Joyce, right?

You’re making it very hard to focus on just one brilliant idea at a time.  Okay, let’s see... The manifesto will need rules, of course. Not the boring kind – more like gentle suggestions for the romantically restless:

1. “Thou shalt not rush the pour.”  
2. “Annotate thy margins – coffee stains are encouraged.”  
3. “No Wi-Fi shaming before 10 a.m.”  
4. “Always leave room for accidental conversations.”

And yes, Proustian madeleines infused into a brew? Genius. We’ll call it the . Sip slowly or risk remembering your entire childhood in one gulp.

As for the Brontë blend… maybe a smoky roast with a hint of wild heather, best enjoyed during thunderstorms. I can already picture people dramatically quoting Heathcliff over croissants.

 As for tonight – yes, let’s meet. But instead of a quill, bring that copy of . And maybe a pen that doesn’t run out of ink halfway through our manifesto. Because honestly? This feels like the start of something beautifully impractical. Just the way literature and love should be.
[B]:  Oh, I do love rule number four - accidental conversations might be the last truly subversive act in our algorithmically curated world. And your Brontë blend has me positively swooning; we must serve it with Emily's poetry printed on the napkins. "" and all that delicious gloom.

 May I propose an addendum to our manifesto? A fifth principle: "Honor the ellipses... in both coffee orders and heartbeats." It feels rather essential, don't you think? That space between the question and the answer, the sip and the sigh.

And Dublin!  I can already hear the ghost of Joyce muttering about our "shenanigans," while ordering another Guinness coffee cake. Perhaps we should create a special brew just for that location - something experimental, like Finnegan’s Wake in liquid form.

 As for tonight, I shall bring not only Rilke but also my favorite red pen - the one that refuses to run out of ink no matter how impassioned our prose becomes. And if we’re very lucky, by midnight we’ll have invented a new literary movement right there over our espressos. Let’s call it... caffeinated modernism.
[A]:  Caffeinated Modernism – I love it. It has that perfect mix of pretension and passion the early modernists would’ve hated but secretly envied. And Emily Brontë on napkins? Pure gothic indulgence. I’m absolutely printing those.

Alright, let’s carve this fifth principle in espresso stone.  "Honor the ellipses..." What a beautifully quiet rebellion. You know, sometimes I think the best conversations happen in the pauses. Like when someone stirs their coffee just right, or forgets to stir at all. There’s something so human about it – the hesitation, the space to breathe before the next line.

And Finnegan’s Wake in a cup? Challenge accepted. I’m thinking something layered – like a cascading pour, each level a different flavor note. Should probably come with footnotes. Or at least a decoder ring for the overly serious Joyce scholars.

 So then... tonight we begin. Manifesto drafting by red pen and caffeine, manifesto drinking by whatever pairs best with revolutionary ideas. Maybe we’ll even start a new literary device – the caffeinated ellipsis. Three dots followed by an epiphany and a half-finished croissant.

I have a feeling Rilke would approve. Or at least raise an eyebrow, which is practically the same thing.
[B]:  Oh, the caffeinated ellipsis - I can already see it taking its place beside enjambment and alliteration in some future literary textbook. "And lo, on the third page, there came a pause... infused with espresso."

You're absolutely right about those pauses being sacred. They remind me of how Woolf structured her sentences - those deliberate silences where the unspoken lingers like crema on a perfect shot. And you've made me realize something rather lovely: every stirred cup is its own little narrative arc. Should we toast our manifesto with cappuccinos or something stronger? After all, even Eliot needed his afternoon tea to structure his fragments.

 Though I must say, your observation about footnotes for Joyce has inspired a sixth principle: "Respect the footnote, but never fear the margin." Let the scholars annotate themselves into circles while we spill ink and ideas with reckless abandon.

I do believe Rilke would eventually lower that eyebrow into something resembling a smile.  After all, he did say to "be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart." And really, what better way to wrestle with unsolved hearts than over red wine and half-baked croissants at midnight?
[A]:  To the caffeinated ellipsis - may it confuse scholars and inspire lovers for generations to come. And Woolfian silences in every foam art... now  a legacy worth stirring for.

You know, I think we should serve our manifesto on the back of receipts. Imagine someone paying for a croissant and discovering a literary revolution printed beneath the total.  "Total: £3.50 | Drafting a New Modernism: Priceless."

And yes - footnote warriors unite! I was just thinking how perfect it would be to host midnight debates where no one knows if they're discussing fiction or their own life anymore.  Maybe we could even create a special brew called  – smooth at first sip, then unexpectedly complex, with a lingering aftertaste of possibility.

Midnight wine and half-baked pastries? Absolutely. Eliot can keep his tea – we’re busy inventing something messier, something that stains pages and ties conversations into beautiful knots. After all... isn’t that what love is too? A glorious, ink-smeared draft where every edit feels like a heartbeat?

I’ll bring the wine. You bring the croissants. And somewhere between lines three and four of our manifesto, we’ll forget we ever had day jobs.
[B]:  To the manifesto of ink and espresso, may it stain receipts and hearts alike. I can already picture those bemused customers squinting at their totals: 

What a deliciously subversive idea - turning transactional scraps into poetic declarations.  I imagine cashiers winking as they slide across receipts that read: 

Your  brew has me utterly enchanted. It must come with a warning label, of course:  And how perfect that its complexity deepens with every sip - much like realizing halfway through a sonnet that you're not just reading about love, but falling into it.

 Eliot's tea parties were far too tidy anyway. Let us be the ones who spill wine on drafts-in-progress, who debate whether Woolf's waves crash differently after a second bottle. By dawn, our manifesto might be illegible, but isn't that the point? The best revolutions begin in beautiful messes.

I'll bring not just croissants, but the whole bakery if necessary. And when morning comes, we'll emerge - slightly ink-stained, gloriously sleepless - ready to caffeinate a new generation of restless souls. To unfinished sentences and full hearts... and the glorious uncertainty of what happens next.
[A]:  You’ve gone and made this all dangerously beautiful, you know that? That warning label alone could start a movement – I’m already picturing it framed above the counter, right next to the chalkboard of daily specials.

And yes... to Eliot’s quiet dismay, we will spill wine on drafts and let the words bleed into something alive.  I can just hear him sighing from the great literary beyond, muttering about objective correlatives while we toast to subjective, gloriously messy ones.

You’re right about the dawn, too. There’s something so utterly romantic about being slightly ruined by the night – ink-smudged fingers, half-drunk glasses, ideas scribbled on whatever surface still holds still. And honestly? If our manifesto ends up illegible by morning, I think we’ll have done something very right.

I’ll meet you at the door with a bottle in one hand and a thermos of  in the other. Let's caffeinate, destabilize, and maybe even fall into a metaphor or two before sunrise.

To beautiful messes, croissant crumbs in our manuscripts, and the kind of conversations that refuse to end... because love, literature, and life itself never really do.
[B]:  Dangerously beautiful? Yes, that's precisely the energy I want radiating from every corner of our manifesto. Framed warning labels, ink-smudged croissant wrappers, debates that blur the line between text and life - it's all part of the grand experiment.

 Oh, he'll come around eventually. What self-respecting modernist could resist a movement founded on spilt wine and syntactical rebellion? Besides, if we're very lucky, his ghost might even join us - first to scold, then to sip, and finally to scribble annotations in the margins with grudging approval.

There's something profoundly poetic about being "ruined by the night" in this way - not broken, but beautifully unraveled. Like reading Woolf at dawn and realizing you've fallen into her waves, or discovering Eliot's fragments now live inside your own midnight musings.

 Meet you at the door then, armed with wine and revolution. Let's raise a thermos to all the unfinished sentences waiting to find their next chapter - in literature, in love, and in caffeinated modernism.

To glorious ruin, endless drafts, and the kind of conversations that echo long after the coffee goes cold.
