[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Addicted? My dear, the only addiction I cultivate is to Browning's dramatic monologues. Though I must confess, my ancient Nokia does occasionally display a rather charming digital rendition of the Oxford English Dictionary's word-of-the-day feature.
[A]: Ah~ 看来你是个classic literature enthusiast呢！不过说到addiction，我最近倒是沉迷于一个forensic puzzle game 🔍 里面那些crime scene reconstruction简直让我欲罢不能！
[B]: How delightfully macabre! Though I must say, the Victorians perfected the art of forensic puzzles long before your digital diversions - Wilkie Collins' 'The Moonstone' essentially invented the detective novel while Browning's 'Porphyria's Lover'... well, let's just call it an early case study in criminal psychology.
[A]: 哈哈，你这种把literature和forensics结合的方式真有意思！ 说到这个，我昨天刚读完'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'，里面那个用打字机字体破案的case简直brilliant！
[B]: Ah, 'A Case of Identity' - Watson's description of the typewritten letters as 'mechanically perfect' versus human handwriting's 'individuality' is positively prophetic in our age of digital uniformity. Though Holmes would be appalled at how modern forensics have reduced his beloved tobacco ash analysis to mere... what do they call it? 'DNA sequencing.' How dreadfully efficient.
[A]: Exactly！现在连fingerprint analysis都用AI了 🤖 不过说真的，我昨天在lab里遇到个case，受害者的nail polish居然成了关键evidence！这让我想起'The Red-Headed League'里那个油漆的clue~
[B]:  My dear forensic enthusiast, you've just articulated why Conan Doyle remains relevant - the scarlet thread of murder running through the colorless skein of life, as Holmes would say. Though I do wonder what he'd make of your 'nail polish forensics.' Probably dismiss it as 'elementary' before deducing the victim's entire cosmetic regimen from a single fleck of varnish.
[A]: 哈哈哈，Holmes确实会这么说！不过说真的，modern forensics可比维多利亚时代advanced多了~ 我们上周用mass spectrometry分析出受害者lipstick里的rare chemical，直接锁定了murderer！Holmes要是有这技术，估计破案时间能cut in half ⚖️
[B]: How terribly... clinical. Though I suppose even my beloved Browning would struggle to compose romantic verse about your mass spectrometers. Still, there's poetry in precision - your 'rare chemical' has the same revelatory power as the telltale iambic pentameter in a forged manuscript. Just with fewer metaphors about nightingales.
[A]: Hah！You're absolutely right！Forensics is like poetry - 都需要敏锐的observation和precise analysis。不过我得承认，比起analyzing sonnets，我更擅长解读blood spatter patterns 💉 这大概就是为什么我选择了morgue而不是literature department吧~
[B]: And thus the world turns - where I see meter and metaphor in 'My Last Duchess,' you find narrative in arterial spray patterns. Though I must insist we share more common ground than you think; after all, both our professions revolve around people who... how shall I put this... have quite literally lost their heads over something.
[A]: Hahaha！这个比喻简直perfect！ 敬我们这些整天和dead bodies打交道的professionals~ 虽然你研究的是deceased poets，而我研究的是poetically deceased victims 🕵️‍♂️☕
[B]:  To the eternal dance between corpus and corpse, my macabre colleague! Though next time you encounter a particularly poetic bloodstain pattern, do consider naming it after a Browning poem - 'Porphyria's Splatter' has rather a nice ring to it, don't you think?
[A]: OMG！'Porphyria's Splatter' - 这绝对会成为forensics界的legend！我得把这个记下来，下次在crime scene conference上presentation用 📝 说不定还能publish篇paper叫《Literary References in Bloodstain Pattern Analysis》呢！
[B]: How perfectly dreadful... and yet academically irresistible! Though should you proceed with this scholarly endeavor, I must insist on being credited as consulting philologist. One can only imagine the peer reviews: 'While the methodology is sound, the author's interpretation of Macbeth-esque blood imagery lacks sufficient textual grounding in Act V, Scene i...'
[A]: Hah！Deal！You'll be myofficial literary consultant~ 我们可以在acknowledgments里写："Special thanks to the Victorian ghost who kept insisting that Lady Macbeth's 'Out damn spot' was actually the first recorded case of bloodstain pattern analysis" 👻🔬
[B]:  Splendid! Though I shall haunt your footnotes most mercilessly if you dare omit my favorite bit of trivia: that Shakespeare's original Globe Theatre was built using timber from a dismantled bear-baiting pit - making all those bloody tragedies quite literally staged on the bones of violent entertainment. Now that's what I call forensic architecture!
[A]: Wow...这简直是Shakespearean crime scene reconstruction的perfect example！我得把这个加到我的research里。 题目就叫《From Bear-Baiting to Bloodstains: A Historical Perspective》怎么样？你真是个treasure trove of macabre knowledge！
[B]: How deliciously morbid! Though I must warn you - pursue this line of inquiry too far, and you'll find yourself giving keynote addresses at conferences where medievalists and forensic pathologists awkwardly mingle over canapés, debating whether the Bayeux Tapestry qualifies as early crime scene documentation. Not that I'd know anything about such... specialized academic gatherings, of course.
