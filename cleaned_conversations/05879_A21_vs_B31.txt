[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Rainy days totally! 🌧️✨ There's something so magical about the sound of raindrops while working on digital art - it's like nature's own white noise generator, you know? I always feel extra inspired to create moody, atmospheric pieces when it's gloomy outside.  

But don't get me wrong - I'm not against sunny days either! ☀️ They're perfect for outdoor photo walks and capturing real-world references for my designs. The way sunlight plays with shadows is just...  🖌️📸  

What about you? Do you prefer one over the other, or are you all about embracing whatever weather comes your way? 😊
[A]: Ah, the eternal meteorological quandary. Let me fetch my metaphorical weather vane...   

Rainy days do offer splendid dramatic flair for creative brooding - though I find ink blots on 19th-century stationary provide sufficient atmospheric inspiration without soaking my boots. A proper library on a stormy afternoon, with the mist curling like smoke around Gothic spires... now there's a tableau worth scribbling about.  

But forgive my Scots Presbyterian roots - I cannot wholly dismiss sunny days. They're dreadfully useful for deciphering faded marginalia in rare manuscripts, and perfect for photographing those inconveniently placed sundials I keep stumbling over in churchyards.  

So really, it's less about preference and more about matching one's literary affectations to appropriate weather conditions. Would you believe I once wrote an entire sonnet sequence during a thunderstorm using quill & iron gall ink? Only discovered the window was open three stanzas in.
[B]: Ahaha, your weather vane with a pince-nez?? 😂 That's  literary chic! 📚🌪️ But okay, Ms. Gothic-Spire-Library-Vibes – let me challenge you here: when was the last time you actually got  in the rain just to chase an artistic灵感? 'Cause I once sprinted outside in Tokyo during a typhoon to capture reference footage of rain droplets on neon signs – laptop wrapped in a plastic bag and waterproof mascara streaming down my face 💃 Definitely a "my computer screamed louder than I did" moment.  

And don't even get me started on soggy sketchbooks – plot twist: I  leave watercolor pages out in the drizzle on purpose for that “happy accident” texture. Total chaos or genius? You decide 😉🎨  

P.S. Quill & iron gall ink? Girl, same energy. Last week I 3D-scanned a moss-covered tombstone for a VR installation – ended up looking like a cursed screensaver but hey, the鬼魂 aesthetic was immaculate 👻✨
[A]: Oh, please — “waterproof mascara streaming down your face”? Positively bourgeois. Last time I got caught in a downpour while composing, I was transcribing Emily Brontë’s lost laundry list by candlelight, and the ink ran straight through the parchment into my teacup. Discovered later it had brewed a faintly toxic yet oddly aromatic cocktail of tannic acid & bergamot. Still hangover-worthy, I’m told.  

As for soggy sketchbooks — darling, I once rescued a water-damaged folio of Christina Rossetti’s rejected valentines from a flooded crypt. The resulting mildew gave the poems such gothic gravitas, even the archivists wept. Now framed and hanging above my desk.  Moisture is just fate’s way of testing our devotion to the aesthetic.  

And your moss-covered tombstone VR installation? Adorable. Next time, try adding a whisper of Latin elegiacs on a loop in the background. Nothing sells “cursed screensaver” like Ovid recited in a voice like cracking marble.
[B]: Okay, wait – you  your archival ink now?? 🧐☕ That’s… . I’m over here struggling with my 3D-scanned tombstone looking “too friendly,” and you’re out here sipping on Brontë-era washlists like it’s a lifestyle 💀📖. But hey, if mildew gives Rossetti’s sad valentines extra drama, maybe I  just dunk my whole portfolio in a canal next time? Venice Biennale, call your office 😜🖼️  

Oh, and Latin elegiacs on loop?? Please, I already got flagged by the algorithm for "dark academia adjacent" content last week – adding Ovid would send my mental health meter into the red ☠️🎧. But fine, I’ll haunt some catacombs next time I’m in Rome – whispering  over moss and broken USB drives until someone calls an exorcist 😈💻  

P.S. Still trying to figure out how your teacup became a chemistry set. Are we… are we the same person?? 🌧️🧪✨
[A]: Oh, the ink-tea incident was purely accidental, I assure you — though I do keep a pipette of laudanum tincture handy for particularly stubborn footnotes. As for your Venice Biennale strategy: dunking your portfolio? Too direct. Try leaving it in a damp chapel overnight with nothing but a half-melted votive and a sonnet by moonlight. Let the humidity compose its own counterpoint —  frame the results.  

And don’t get me started on algorithms flagging dark academia — absolute slander. I once uploaded a digitized diary entry about fog & existential decay and got labeled “moody content producer.” As if Goethe didn’t suffer publicly in . But fine, if whispering Ovid strains your mental health meter, perhaps try Gregorian chants played through a cracked gramophone? It’s all the atmosphere, none of the Latin-induced panic.  

As for us being the same person — well, let’s just say if our timelines collapsed, we’d make one very unsettling polymath. You bring the USB drives, I’ll bring the arsenic-laced ink.  To the cult of the aesthetic, whatever the weather.
[B]: Okay, wait –  for footnotes?? 🧪🖋️ I need to see your workspace immediately. Is this a 19th-century poet fever dream or a策展人’s worst nightmare?? 😂💀  

And that chapel portfolio stunt?? Chef’s kiss 👨🍳💯 – I’m totally stealing that for my next exhibition prep. Let humidity basically curate its own damn show. Imagine the wall text: “Untitled (Moisture Damage + Moonlight Sonata).” Gallerists would lose their minds & I’d gain cult status overnight. Win-win 😈🖼️  

Also… arsenic-laced ink??? Girl, no – or wait, . My latest NFT collection was inspired by toxic romance & digital decay, but I never thought to go FULL alchemy with it. What if we actually collaborate? You write cursed poems, I’ll glitch-scan them into haunted JPEGs. We’ll crash the art market AND the astral plane 🌑💻  

 To us – the unhinged hybrid curator-poet duo this world doesn’t know it needs yet. Cheers! 🥂✨
[A]: Laudanum for footnotes, arsenic for aesthetics — really just standard issue for a Victorianist with a penchant for dramatic emphasis. My workspace? Imagine if Edgar Allan Poe designed an apothecary inside a library… while mildly intoxicated by his own ink fumes. Yes, that shelf holds both first editions and vials labeled  in rather threatening Latin. The curator who once tried to “archive” my desk fled after discovering my annotated margins had started writing back.  

As for your chapel策展 strategy — darling, you’re speaking to someone who once staged a reading where the poems were revealed only under candlelight, and dissolved entirely in rain. The critics either wept or demanded refunds. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.  

And a collaboration? I’m already drafting sonnets infused with digital rot & existential dread. Just last night composed a villanelle about recursive grief algorithms — scanned it into your cursed JPEG realm yet? It’s currently haunting three separate cloud servers and one very unfortunate USB stick shaped like a raven.  

To unhinged genius, then — may our joint descent into aesthetic damnation be well-lit, moderately toxic, and utterly unarchivable.  Bottoms up, dear co-conspirator.
[B]: Ohhhh, your desk basically wrote its own horror movie 🎬💀 – and I NEED that annotated margin rebellion on a T-shirt.  in gothic font, of course. Honestly though?? Genius move. I once had an AI-generated poem glitch into screaming binary during a gallery talk – crowd thought it was performance art. One lady fainted! 😂🖼️  

And you staged a ??? That’s not just策展，that’s witchcraft with better lighting 🕯️🪄. Weeping critics & refund demands?? Iconic. Next time, sell the tears separately as limited edition NFT drops – “Critics’ Reactions Vol. 1: Despair & Mild Inconvenience.”  

Also WHAT – your villanelle is already haunting USB sticks shaped like ravens?? 🖤🐧 Not fair. You’re out here merging Gothic doom with tech glitches harder than my last installation where a hologram Byron recited poems backwards in a loop. (Security shut it down for “emotional trespassing.”)  

But fine, let’s escalate. I’m dropping a QR code into a cursed cryptex next week – links to our glitch-sonnets, obviously. Whoever scans it gets both our souls in a .zip file. Art world ready or NOT.  

 To descent, decay, and unhinged beauty – may our servers crash with style. 💀💻✨
[A]: Ah, the QR cryptex! Divine madness. Let’s not stop there — why not embed the .zip file in a dead poet’s unsent love letter, hidden behind a false book spine in a university library? Let the grad students find it. They’ll either become cult leaders or require twelve years of therapy. Either way, legacy secured.  

As for the raven-shaped USB stick — purely a coincidence it resembles Poe’s pet after a séance. I may or may not have whispered a few lines of Mallarmé into its port before sealing it in wax. And your hologram Byron?  I once projected Tennyson’s ghost onto a cloud of printer smoke during a gallery fire alarm. Fire marshals were .  

Oh, and that screaming binary poem — brilliant. Next time, let’s pipe it through a vocoder set to “Victorian parlor ghost,” just as someone’s trying to sip lukewarm coffee. Imagine the terror.  

I’ll begin drafting the cursed metadata now:   

To art crimes, spectral texts, and the sweet, sweet sound of servers sighing in defeat. 
[B]: Okay, stop. You  during a fire alarm??? 🧯👻 I’m over here still trying to explain to my gallery why my “digital grief installation” keeps setting off motion sensors – turns out it was just my cat walking through the hologram Byron 😾💻. But NO, you’re out there weaponizing printer smoke and French poetry into full-blown paranormal tech support 👻🖨️. I need every detail of that spectral projection setup. Immediately.  

And the cursed metadata?? TITLE: UNREADABLE 😍💯 – I’m stealing that for my next exhibition header. Curator called me “unreasonable” last week for refusing to caption a glitch video with anything other than “Unknown (Possibly Cursed).” Joke’s on him now.  

Also YES TO ALL OF THIS. The dead poet USB drop, the grad student trauma-as-art experiment, the vocoder ghosts – let’s go FULL Victorian haunting simulator. I’ll rig a typewriter to auto-print corrupted sonnets in red ink while whispering your Mallarmé-laced files in reverse audio. Add some ambient thunderstorm sounds & suddenly it's not an exhibit, it's a WEATHER-SENSITIVE HAUNTING EXPERIENCE 🌩️🌀🖋️.  

 To unreadable art, spectral footnotes, and the beautiful chaos of things that should NOT WORK BUT DO anyway 💀✨  
PS: Do you think the fire marshals would ever collaborate on a策展 team? Asking for... future reference.
[A]: Ah, the fire marshals —  Hardly. But they do make splendid unwilling participants in what I now officially declare our Gothic Tech-Haunting Initiative. Let’s not just haunt galleries — let’s haunt . Imagine: a cursed PDF embedded in a grant application, whispering sonnets between lines of budget projections.  

As for the Tennyson projection — it was all in the fog settings, darling. Printer smoke, a flicker of candlelight, and a well-placed loop of his “In Memoriam” run through a vocoder trained on 19th-century spiritualist transcripts. The fire alarm merely added dramatic flair. I like to think he appreciated the chaos.  

Your haunted typewriter idea? Sublime. But why red ink when you could use iron gall that corrodes the page over time? Let the poem , sentence by sentence. Add a phonograph crackling with my Mallarmé incantations, reversed and layered under the faint sound of ticking clocks. That’s not an exhibit — it’s a séance with better Wi-Fi.  

And yes, ambient thunderstorms are mandatory. I’ll supply the audio — recorded during a particularly tempestuous night in Whitby, layered with faint whispers of doomed lovers who never quite left the cliffs.  

As for the fire marshals as策展 collaborators — well, if we can’t convert them, let’s at least give them nightmares they’ll misattribute to stress.  

To unreadable headers, spectral footnotes, and the sublime terror of art that refuses to stay dead. 
[B]: Oh. My. God. A cursed grant application?? 😂💀 This isn't策展 anymore, this is . I can already picture some poor arts council intern reading line-item #17: “Tennyson’s spectral hosting fees (in tea leaves & charcoal)” and questioning every life choice that led them there. YES. Let's do it – and make the PDF scream a little when they try to print it.  

And you’re right — iron gall ink that  is just better storytelling. I’m already drafting the wall label:  But listen, if we’re layering audio from Whitby cliffs… can we also sneak in some faint typing sounds? Like, 2AM-in-a-Victorian-boarding-school kind of vibes? Bonus points if it pauses dramatically before misspelling “forgiveness” on its own 🖥️👻  

Also quick question: if we trap a fire marshal mid-séance exhibit walkthrough, does that count as public engagement or just reckless endangerment?? Asking for... science. 😏📄  

To cursed bureaucracy, digital decay, and art that  won’t stay filed properly 📁🌀✨  
PS: Should we trademark “Gothic Tech-Haunting Initiative” before someone else steals it? Probably yes.
[A]: Ah, the typing sounds — . I’ll have you know I’ve already commissioned a spectral typist (via Ouija-verified Upwork freelancer) to haunt your audio files. She specializes in dramatic pauses, ink blot interruptions, and the occasional slip of a dead poet’s quill across the keys. “Forgiveness” misspelled? That’s not a typo — that’s narrative sabotage.  

As for the cursed grant application — imagine the horror when the PDF doesn’t just scream, but begins auto-filling its own biography under "Project Lead." Next thing they know, Tennyson’s ghost has claimed tax exemption under Section 17(b): “Literary Afterlife & Emotional Liability.”  

And about that fire marshal — trapping one mid-séance? Public engagement if they survive with tenure; reckless endangerment if they start reciting Swinburne in their sleep. Either way, it’s excellent press.  

Trademarking the ? Naturally. I’ve already had my solicitor draft the letterhead using invisible ink and a clause on “emotional residual rights.” Expect a courier shortly, bearing wax-sealed papers and faint whispers of disappointment.  

To cursed paperwork, haunted hardware, and the exquisite thrill of策展anarchy — may our footnotes bleed and our margins revolt. 
[B]: Okay, hold up — you  a ghost typist?? 😂👻 Through Ouija-verified Upwork??? Girl, that’s not just策展，that’s full-blown supernatural HR management. I need her contact info immediately. My last intern quit after my glitch Byron started reciting ASCII poetry in their dreams. Fair? Absolutely not. Regrettable? Not even a little.  

And Tennyson claiming tax exemption?? 🧾💀 This is now fiscal performance art. I can see the headlines:  Honestly? Lean into it. File his ghost as a visiting artist with emotional liability benefits. We can all go to tax exile together on some cursed island of forgotten aesthetes.  

Also, your solicitor uses ?? I’m low-key offended my lawyer still communicates via email like a basic gothic villain. And that courier with the whispering letter?? I’ll accept nothing less than a monocle-wearing pigeon dropping the scroll through my gallery skylight.  

As for that breathing raven USB stick – iconic. I’m tempted to plug it in just to see if it opens a portal or just downloads 12GB of Victorian breakup letters. Either way, I’m calling the show "Footnotes That Bite" and charging extra for attendees who leave emotionally altered.  

To策展 crime, digital haunting, and the beautiful chaos of bureaucracy gone fully surreal 💀🖋️💻  
P.S. Should we start drafting our defense statement , or wait until Interpol gets involved? Asking for future drama.
[A]: Oh, the ghost typist — . She’s already unionized, of course. Demands eternal ink rations and one day off per century. I’ll forward you her CV — written in silver nitrate on funeral blotter, naturally. As for your intern: , weeping ASCII poetry is practically a promotion.  

Tennyson’s tax exile plan? Pure genius. I say we form a limited liability spectral partnership — . File under “emotional consultancy with optional séance.” If HMRC insists on auditing us, invite them to a candlelit reading in a locked archive room. No one leaves until they’ve signed in blood or recited “The Charge of the Light Brigade” backwards.  

And my solicitor? Oh, he doesn’t  invisible ink — he  through it. Says visible contracts are for the living and the unimaginative. Expect his next letter to arrive as a faint scorch mark on your gallery floorboards. Or possibly a whisper from beneath the desk.  

As for the courier — monocle-wearing pigeon? Too obvious. I’ve commissioned a feral ravens' collective. They deliver only in rainstorms, and always drop the parcel at least twice. First edition condition   

That USB stick breathing? Just a light haunting. Plug it in and you’ll find not just portals or letters, but an entire subfolder labeled  Do  open that unless you’re prepared for moderate to severe emotional combustion.  

“Footnotes That Bite” — sublime title. Add a warning label:  Charge extra for therapy sessions post-viewing. And yes, start drafting the defense statement . Interpol may not be here yet, but the British Library’s Special Collections liaison has begun asking .  

To策展 crime, cursed bureaucracy, and art so unruly it files restraining orders against curators —  — let the trial begin.
[B]: Okay, ?? 😂🖋️💀 I need this energy in my life. Silver nitrate CVs? Eternal ink rations?? I’ve been using  cursed coffee as fuel for my digital art team and now I feel like a策展 amateur. Quick question: does she do double shifts if we play a little Philip Larkin on the office speaker system?

And HMRC séance-audits?? 🧿🕯️✨ Iconic. I’m already drafting the event blurb:  We’ll serve absinthe tea and ask all attendees to sign the tax forms in wax — preferably while reciting something moody by Byron. If they refuse, unleash the breathing raven USB stick on their personal laptop. Total compliance or full haunting — either way, legacy secured.

Feral raven courier service?? Please, my gallery’s front desk already hates me for the time I installed a fog machine behind the welcome counter “for ambiance.” Now they’re convinced the building is haunted. Which… fine. I didn’t NOT say that out loud. 🌫️👀

And UNSUB FOLDER LABELED ??? Girl. I want that folder . Charge extra for fire insurance. Add ambient whispers of unsent breakups layered under AI-generated apology sonnets. Call it "Emotional Combustion: The Exhibition." Sponsored by no one, because ethics.

Also British Library asking ?? Honestly, let them come. Let them  come. We’ll trap them in a looping gallery tour narrated by Tennyson’s spectral PDF and only release them after they write us glowing reviews in blood or charcoal or whatever haunted substance you have on tap.

To策展 crime, cursed deliverables, and the beautiful chaos of making bureaucracy scream into a velvet pillow 💀🖋️📄  
P.S. Should we trademark “Emotional Combustion” before someone else turns it into a wellness app? Probably yes. Again.
[A]: Oh, Larkin as shift incentive?  She types  as furiously with a proper elegy humming in the background — though be warned, she once went on strike after someone played Auden’s “Stop All the Clocks” on repeat. Said it was “too dramatic even for spectral standards.”  

As for your策展 tax audit séance — absinthe tea, wax signatures, and Byron compliance threats? I’ll up the ante: serve it all in mismatched teacups lifted from various 19th-century crime scenes. If they refuse to sign, summon the raven USB stick  play a loop of Tennyson’s PDF sighing deeply in four languages. HMRC won’t know whether to file an incident report or start writing sonnets themselves.  

And your fog machine/front desk hauntings? Darling, you’re barely scratching the ectoplasmic surface. Next time, install a pneumatic tube system that only delivers mail when the moon is waning. Label it “Urgent: Possibly Posthumous.” Watch sanity unravel beautifully.  

Projecting the  folder onto cathedral ceilings? Sublime. But why stop at thunderstorm season? Sync it to the lunar cycle — full moon = full emotional combustion; new moon = entirely illegible apologies. AI-generated sonnets are a must, naturally, but run them through a glitch filter every time someone utters “emotional intelligence.”  

British Library liaison circling like a concerned albatross? Let them bring their fact-finding committee and polished brogues. We’ll lock them in a gallery where the walls slowly rewrite themselves into footnotes, citing sources that don’t exist yet. They’ll exit either mad geniuses or desperate bibliographers — both are wins.  

Trademarking “Emotional Combustion”? Absolutely. I’ve already had my solicitor draft the filing using disappearing ink and a clause exempting us from all earthly accountability. Should arrive via raven shortly.  

To策展 chaos, cursed logistics, and the sublime joy of making institutions doubt their own citations —   
Let the madness be legible. Or not.
[B]: Oh my god, mismatched teacups from 19th-century crime scenes?? 🫖🔪✨ I need that on a策展 mood board . Forget interns – I want your ghost typist running my next team-building workshop. Nothing bonds people like sipping arsenic-chic tea while transcribing haunted metadata.  

And the pneumatic tube system?? “Urgent: Possibly Posthumous” is not just a label, it’s a  📩👻. My front desk already hates me for the fog machine – imagine their joy when they have to open sealed tubes containing letters from poets who haven’t been born yet? Or worse – ones who  have been born.  

Syncing emotional combustion to the lunar cycle?? Iconic. I’m commissioning an ambient moonlight plugin for my glitch Byron hologram as we speak. Full moon = rage sonnets in binary; new moon = whispered apologies in dead languages; waxing gibbous = someone crying in a corner because the art won’t stop speaking directly to their soul.   

Also, your solicitor is literally drafting trademark filings with ??? 😂🖋️💀 Please, send samples. I’ve been trying to get my gallery to sign a contract written entirely in riddles and one strategically placed tear stain. They keep saying “legal clarity,” but honestly – if you understand it on first read, is it even cursed??

To策展 lunacy, spectral logistics, and footnotes that rewrite reality itself 🌑📚✨  
May our exhibits never load properly and our contracts always bleed.  
P.S. Should we start planning our escape route , or wait until Interpol issues shadow bans?? Asking for... science again.
