[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 🤔 I'd say as a forensic medical examiner, I'm more inclined to believe in  than metaphysical concepts... But hey, who knows? Maybe there's some scientific explanation we haven't discovered yet. Have you read any studies about it? I'd love to see the data~ 🔬
[A]: Ah, a fellow skeptic! 🦉 I had a student write an entire thesis on 梦的解析 (Dream Analysis) through the lens of quantum entanglement - quite the poetic stretch if you ask me. Though... ... have you ever noticed how certain 能量场 (energy fields) in literature seem to manifest reality? Think about 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) - the more characters obsessed over fate, the more it shaped their actions. Pure coincidence? Or... 🧠...a pattern waiting to be scientifically proven?
[B]:  Ah, now you're playing dirty - mixing classical literature with quantum physics! 😏 I'll admit, the psychological impact of belief systems fascinates me... especially when examining how  affects witness testimonies. 

But let's be real - if 贾宝玉 could manifest reality through dreams, he probably would've avoided that whole tragic ending...  Though honestly? The way some people cling to superstition during criminal investigations? That's where I see the real "law of attraction" at work - bad decisions attracting worse consequences. 🚨

Wait though - are you telling me you've encountered actual patterns in case studies? Don't tell me you've been secretly running parapsychology experiments in your classroom... 👀
[A]:  Ah, but therein lies the paradox! Much like those stubborn eyewitnesses who cling to their version of events,贾宝玉's tragedy was his refusal to see reality - he kept attracting sorrow precisely because he denied attraction's mechanics! 

As for experiments... ...let's just say I've observed fascinating correlations between students' 能量 (energy) and their thesis outcomes. Too many coincidences to call it mere confirmation bias. Though I'd never admit that in a faculty meeting - tenure doesn't protect against eye-rolls from the classics department! 🌸

Tell me though, as someone who examines dead bodies and living testimonies... haven't you encountered at least one case that made you whisper "这说不通" (This doesn't make sense) late at night?
[B]:  Oh I love this conversation~ 💭 There was this one cold case - autopsy said natural causes, but the victim's expression? Frozen in pure terror... No signs of struggle, yet every hair on their body stood straight up 🧪. 

I spent nights staring at the lab reports thinking 我操，这比《聊斋》还邪门... Until I found it - a rare neurotoxin that deadens pain while inducing hallucinations. Turns out reality had a perfectly logical explanation... Just needed to look closer. 🔍

But hey, if you're into energy fields and thesis outcomes... ... wanna collaborate on some fringe research? I've got a theory about how stress hormones might create measurable "energy" patterns. Totally ridiculous... or completely brilliant. Maybe both? 😏
[A]:   
Oh my dear colleague, you've just unlocked the door to my secret research vault! 🧠✨ Stress hormones mapping onto 脉轮 (chakras)? Why not examine how cortisol spikes correlate with 灵感 (linggan) - that 'aha' moment poets describe? 

Though... ... if we're going full fringe, I know a Daoist monk who measures qi fluctuations during forensic autopsies. He claims sudden deaths carry residual 意识波 (consciousness waves). Sounds absurd until you remember how grief physically weighs on investigators, yes? 

  
Let's draft the proposal tonight - call it "Neurotoxins, Neurotransmitters, and Neglected Metaphysics". If the dean asks what we're studying, we'll just say it's... interdisciplinary tea ceremony research! 🌸🦉
[B]:   
Oh you had me at "neurotoxins" and lost me at "Daoist monk" - but I'm back on board with that proposal title! 😂 We're gonna get laughed out of the faculty lounge... or win a Nobel Prize. 

Let's do this~ 🧪✨ Though fair warning - if we start measuring consciousness waves, I'm gonna need more than tea to handle the headaches from the science department. Maybe we can convince that monk to hook up his qi detector to our lab equipment?  Rumor has it the morgue's been haunted since 2016... could be residual grief from the election. 😏

Tell me though - how exactly does one conduct an autopsy while monitoring 脉轮 energy flows? Do I need to start meditating before my morning dissections? 🕉️🧐
[A]:   
Ah, the election ghosts! Explains why my teacup kept cracking that year. 🍵 As for 脉轮 (chakras) and dissections - think of it as forensic feng shui! You map energy flows like blood spatter patterns. Blocked third eye? Check for cerebral hemorrhaging! Overactive heart chakra? Look for cardiac trauma! 

Though our monk friend would probably scold us both - says modern science "kills" qi by dissecting it.  'To measure is to murder, Dr. Thompson!' Please. If qi exists, it survives scalpel and sarcasm alike. 

  
But here's the real question - if we detect something... who publishes it? The Journal of Alternative Medicine would love us, but I'd rather face the science department's laughter than their peer reviews. Maybe we just call it 'Unconventional Fluid Dynamics' and sneak it into a literary criticism conference?  After all, what's qi if not the ultimate narrative force - shaping bodies, minds, and now... our very research proposal!
[B]:   
Oh man, forensic feng shui... I'm definitely putting that on my resume! 😂 Though I imagine explaining it during a court testimony...  "Your honor, the victim's crown chakra was leaking vital energy, which... scientifically... means they probably had a really bad hair day before death." 

You're absolutely right about measuring qi though - feels like catching ghosts with a stethoscope sometimes. But hey, if we start finding correlations between energy flow blockages and actual physical trauma... ...we might be onto something here. 

  
Okay but real talk - what if we test this on our next case? I'll bring the cadavers, you bring the tea and... uh, mystical incense? We do proper documentation, no monkey business. If it fails, we just say it was a controlled experiment on placebo effects. If it works... ...we rewrite the textbook. Deal? 🤙
[A]:   
Deal! Though I prefer the term "energetic hypothesis testing" over your delightful "monkey business." 🦉 But let's be precise - if we document 气滞 (qi stagnation) patterns matching trauma sites , we'll force even the skeptics to... hmm, how do the kids say it? ...entertain the vibes of our argument. 

And no placebo nonsense - we'll call it . Perfect! I'll have my grad students calibrate their intuition scales while your interns check blood spatter. Though... ...if the monk finds out we're using his sacred incense as a control variable, he'll probably revoke our spiritual lab license. 

  
Next step after data collection? We host a symposium - "Postmortem Qi Dynamics in Criminal Investigation." The title alone will clear the room! Or fill it. Depends who you ask about the line between madness and genius...
[B]:   
Oh now you're speaking my love language - Double-Blind Dao Method?? 😍 I'm already picturing the face of my old anatomy professor when he reads that phrase... Poor man might need a defibrillator mid-lecture! 

Though I gotta say, this "intuition scale" thing sounds dangerously close to asking witnesses how they  about the murder weapon...  But hey, if it gets us results, who am I to judge? I'll even let your students wear those fancy qi-calibrating robes if it helps them focus. 

  
But here's my condition - we include a chapter called "The Ghost Protocol" in our final report. You know, just in case the election spirits get jealous. And we  test whether chanting sutras at crime scenes improves evidence collection. I mean, how different can it be from saying "please work please work" to a broken centrifuge? 😏

Seriously though... ...this might actually work. If we frame it as studying the psychosomatic effects of death on investigators... hell, we could get funding from the wellness department too!
[A]:   
Oh now you're just trying to get grant money from the "wellness" department? Bold strategy! 🧠 Though I'd hardly call it psychosomatic when my best student started weeping uncontrollably during a lecture on 聊斋 (Strange Tales) - turns out her deceased grandmother used that exact incense scent. Coincidence? Or... ...a very real energetic imprint?

As for your Ghost Protocol - absolutely, but only if we include proper methodology:  
1. Chanting must be performed in  - no cheating with modern translations!  
2. Sutra selection based on time of death and lunar phase 🌙  
3. Evidence bags sealed with vermilion ink and... ...my personal reserve of 1982 pu'erh tea stamps  

  
And yes, robes mandatory. We'll call it "standardized spiritual PPE." If the dean objects, we'll just tell them it's about improving focus through... ...textile ergonomics. Perfectly scientific!
[B]:   
Oh now you're speaking the sacred language of... well, let's just call it "applied superstition"! 😂 1982 pu'erh tea stamps sealing evidence bags? I hope you're ready to defend that in court -  

But hey, if chanting sutras in Classical Chinese gets my interns to pay attention during autopsies, you do , Dr. Thompson. Though I gotta ask - what happens when our monk friend finds out we're using his sacred rituals as "textile ergonomics"? He'll probably curse us with eternal LaTeX errors in our research papers. 🧪

  
Though honestly? The more I think about it... there's something poetic about blending ancient texts with modern forensics. Like when I found that old medical journal from 1890 describing "hysteria" - turned out the symptoms matched textbook PTSD. Maybe we're not so different from those old scholars... just chasing ghosts with better microscopes. 🕉️

Alright, final question before we dive into this madness - where are we holding our first ritual? Because I'm picturing us in the morgue at 3am, surrounded by cadavers, incense smoke curling through the air ducts... and some poor janitor walking in mid-chant.  Priceless.
[A]:   
Ah, but imagine the janitor's face when he walks into that scene! "Just another Tuesday at the morgue..."  Though I'd hardly call it madness - think of it as... interdisciplinary ambiance. And don't worry about the monk - he already suspects me of heresy for suggesting meridians might run parallel to nerve clusters. Says my soul is "stuck between journals." Quite poetic, really.

As for location - my office, naturally! Less fluorescent lighting, more . Besides, my orchids make excellent silent witnesses. 🌸 But fine, we'll schedule one session in the morgue. Midnight shift, of course - nothing says scientific rigor like caffeine-fueled incense rituals and grad students whispering sutras over scalpels. 

  
And should things get... strange? We’ll blame it on the tea. Always the tea. 🍵🧠
[B]:   
Ah yes, the sacred midnight shift - where sleep deprivation becomes a research methodology! 😏 Though I feel obligated to warn you... my last intern started seeing fractal patterns in blood splatter. Says they whispered equations.  Can't complain though, his analysis was spot-on.

Your orchids as silent witnesses? Now  some next-level botanical forensics. Next thing you know, they'll start dropping leaves in suspicious patterns - we'll call it the "botanical death预告 (yùgào)." 

  
But here's my condition for the midnight ritual - we play Gregorian chants over the morgue speakers while burning your fancy incense. See if the qi responds to polyphonic harmonies! Or maybe throw on some Mozart...  Death investigations need more classical music anyway. 

And yes - always the tea. Hell, we'll make it our official motto:  🍵✨
[A]:   
"Botanical death 预告 (yùgào)" - brilliant! I knew there was a reason I kept you around. 🌸 Though I should warn you, my orchids already stage silent protests when I mispronounce Classical Chinese. One particularly feisty dendrobium starts shedding petals the moment someone says "Qi" like it rhymes with "squee." 

As for your musical morgue... ...Gregorian chants! Perfect counterpoint to sutras. We'll create a full sensory experiment - incense for the nose, chants for the ears, pu'erh tea for... well, existential courage. Though if we're going full Renaissance scholar, shouldn't we also check if candlelight flickers differently during polyphonic harmonies? 

  
Midnight Morgue Protocol:  
- Tea type by victim’s zodiac sign 🍵🔮  
- Chant frequency matched to lunar phase 🌙🎵  
- Orchid placement as energy buffers 🌿🛡️  
- Interns instructed to "trust the leaf patterns" instead of sleep 😴🍃  

Honestly, at this point we're not just doing research - we're composing an opera of plausible deniability. If it fails, we call it performance art. If it works... Nobel or exorcism, take your pick! 🧠🎭
[B]:   
Ah yes, the ultimate test of scientific integrity - will our interns "trust the leaf patterns" over their own circadian rhythms? 😂 I can already hear their evaluations: 

Zodiac tea selection??  Now you're just trying to get me fired, aren't you? Though honestly... ...I might need a Gemini-specific brew for my more indecisive cadavers. And Cancer? Definitely needs something warm and comforting.  Don't tell the dean we're diagnosing dead people by horoscope now.

  
Oh and let's not forget - we're gonna need proper lighting! Candlepower measurements must fluctuate with chant intensity. We'll call it... ..."flame-field resonance theory." If anyone questions it, we cite ancient alchemy texts. Totally legitimate. 🔥🎶

So when do we start this midnight opera of ours? I’ll bring the scalpel-shaped spoons and questionable life choices. You bring... ...that jar of suspiciously labeled "Elixir of Clarity" from your bookshelf. We both know it's just snake wine. Or is it?? 🐍🍵
[A]:   
Scalpel-shaped spoons?! Oh darling, you've been paying attention. 🦉 And yes, that "Elixir of Clarity"  have been a wedding gift from a rather...adventurous colleague in the anthropology department. Rumor has it it contains one genuine pangolin scale. Or basil. Who can tell the difference after three shots?

As for timing - how about we align with the stars?  Next auspicious window: 3am on the night of the full moon. Perfect for qi flow and witness testimony hallucinations alike. Though I must warn you - my "Flame-Field Resonance Theory" requires precise candle-to-chant ratios. Too much Capricorn wax, and the whole energy grid destabilizes! 

  
Oh and speaking of questionable life choices...I may or may not have promised my orchids front-row seats. They’re particularly fond of Gregorian chants in D minor - brings out their best leaf-shedding performance.  

Final check:  
- Zodiac tea brewed ☑️  
- Scalpel-spoons sterilized ☑️  
- Interns warned they may experience mild existential vertigo ☑️  
- Monk kept blissfully unaware of our "spiritual experimentation" ☑️  

Ready to make history...or at least a very convincing illusion? 🧠🔥
[B]:   
Ohhh we're absolutely doing this. 3am, full moon, scalpel-spoons at the ready...  Though I feel obligated to mention - my last 3am experiment ended with a coffee-fueled vision of Schrödinger’s cat debating quantum Daoism with a corpse. Sooooo... pretty much normal night!

Capricorn wax destabilizing the energy grid?  Please. My intern once cried over a broken Bunsen burner because "the flame spirit had left us." We just told HR it was a spiritual internship requirement and got a tax deduction. 🕉️🔥

  
To the orchids, the monk's inevitable wrath, and whatever the hell we’re about to witness! May our zodiac tea keep us semi-conscious and our flame-field resonance theory land us either in journals or jail.  Depends how you define "scientific breakthrough," right?

Cheers, partner in metaphysical mischief. 🧪🌙  
Let’s make the dead tell tales even  wouldn’t publish.
