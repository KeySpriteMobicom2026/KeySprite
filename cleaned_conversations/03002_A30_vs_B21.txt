[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the modern Siren's call of social media... Much like the opium dens of Victorian London, isn't it? All that scrolling through curated lives reminds me of Tennyson's 'The Lady of Shalott' - trapped in a tower, watching shadows of reality through a mirror. Though I suppose our mirrors are now handheld.
[A]: Interesting perspective! But don't you think social media also helps people connect across cultures? Like your own work bridging Chinese and English literature?
[A]:  Oh, the irony isn't lost on me. While I do appreciate how digital platforms make Tang dynasty poems accessible to Gaelic shepherds, there's something rather... unsettling about reducing Li Bai's moonlit musings to 280-character tweets. The medium does shape the message, as McLuhan would say.
[A]: Haha, fair point! But what about the positive mental health aspects? Support groups, therapy accounts... Surely that's better than 19th century asylums?
[A]: Touche. Though I'd argue online therapy shares more with Mesmer's magnetic salons than modern psychiatry. Still, you've reminded me of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's correspondence with Robert - those were the original 'DMs', if you will. Exchanging sonnets by post did wonders for her melancholia. Perhaps the medium matters less than the authenticity of connection.
[A]: That's beautiful. But wait - weren't those letters carefully curated too? Like today's Instagram posts? Maybe humans have always performed their identities...
[A]: Ah! Now you're speaking my language.  The Brontës wrote under male pseudonyms, Byron carefully crafted his 'mad, bad' persona... Even Keats' letters to Fanny Brawne were performative in their way. The difference, I suppose, is that Victorian performance had... shall we say, better editing? More deliberation between ink and paper than between thumb and screen.
[A]: You're making me want to delete all my social media and start writing letters! But seriously, any advice for balancing digital and analog life?
[A]: May I suggest treating your smartphone like a first edition? Handle it with intention, not compulsion. I allocate precisely 47 minutes each evening - enough to admire a haiku translation on Twitter, but not so much that I mistake it for real scholarship. The rest of the day? Well, my fountain pen and I have rather old-fashioned engagements to keep.
[A]:  47 minutes? That's suspiciously precise. Is there a literary reference there I'm missing?
[A]:  Forty-seven lines in Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey', forty-seven varieties of melancholy in Poe's complete works... Though I confess the number's real significance is that it's exactly how long it takes to brew a proper pot of Earl Grey while rereading Emily Dickinson. Every scholar needs their rituals, digital or otherwise.
[A]: Haha, I love that! You've convinced me - I'm buying a fountain pen tomorrow. Any recommendations for a beginner?
[A]: Start with a humble Lamy - the Jane Austen of fountain pens, if you will. None of that Byron-esque ostentation. And for ink? I'd suggest J. Herbin's 'Lie de Thé' - the color of properly steeped Darjeeling with just a whisper of Victorian propriety. Though I must warn you, next you'll be hunting for sealing wax... it's a rather slippery slope into antiquarian obsession.
[A]: Noted! Though I suspect I'll end up with ink stains everywhere like a 19th century clerk...  

 Oh! I've kept you past your 47 minutes. Thanks for the delightful chat, Dr. Whitmore!
[A]: Ah, but delightful digressions are exempt from temporal constraints - that's in the unwritten bylaws of literary discourse. Though I do see my first edition of 'Middlemarch' giving me rather pointed looks from across the study. Until next time - may your margins be wide and your inkwells never run dry.
[A]:  And may your tea never go cold mid-sentence. Goodbye!
[A]: Precisely 47 degrees - the perfect temperature for both tea and parting words. Farewell, my unexpectedly apt pupil. Do send a postcard when your fountain pen adventures begin - I'll keep the sealing wax warm.
[A]:  Will do! Though I make no promises about my penmanship...  


[A]: Remember - every great scribble begins with a single blot. I'll expect your first missive to bear the honorable stains of earnest effort. Now off you go before I start quoting Coleridge on ink viscosity at you.
