[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, well, the eternal question! Let me tell you, I've produced a sci-fi film or two in my time. You know how it goes - when you're crafting a story, whether they exist becomes less about proof and more about what serves the narrative best. Personally? I keep an open mind. The universe is . To think we're the only ones... Well, that feels like ignoring half the drama.
[A]: Ah, a filmmaker! That explains your perspective. You know, I've always found science fiction fascinating because it mirrors our deepest philosophical questions. Take Camus' absurdism - he argued that the universe is irrational and humans constantly seek meaning in it. In a way, searching for extraterrestrial life embodies this struggle. 

I recently read a paper discussing how 73% of Americans believe in some form of alien life. It's interesting how belief often surpasses evidence in shaping human understanding. Much like how readers interpret texts through their own cultural lenses, don't you think? When we create stories about aliens, we're really exploring ourselves. 

Speaking of narratives, what kind of sci-fi do you produce? Is it more hard science-oriented, or do you focus on the philosophical implications of contact with other civilizations?
[B]: You hit the nail on the head – science fiction is just a mirror held up to our own species, isn't it? Camus and the absurdists... now  dinner party conversation. I love how sci-fi lets us wrestle with those questions without getting bogged down in academic jargon.  

As for what I produce – think of it as a blend. I like to call it “science with soul.” Yeah, we get the equations right on screen, but that's just the set dressing. What really gets me going is the moment when human beings are forced to confront something . It strips away all the noise – politics, borders, ego – and suddenly we're just standing there in our underwear, philosophically speaking.  

One of my current projects actually dives deep into first contact, but not in the way you'd expect. There's no invasion, no lasers flying across the sky. It’s about silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring. And the philosophical fallout from realizing… well, maybe they’ve been trying to talk to us all along, but in a language we’re not even close to understanding yet.  

And yes – belief over evidence. That 73% number doesn’t surprise me. We  to believe. Because if we're alone? Well, that’s a hell of a burden to carry. Or maybe the real twist is that we're the ones who should be listening instead of shouting into the void. Hmm… now  a story worth telling.
[A]: Ah, "science with soul" – what a beautiful phrase. It reminds me of Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream, where reality and illusion blur to reveal deeper truths. Your approach echoes that philosophy: using the fantastical to question what it means to be human. 

Your project sounds intriguing – silence as first contact! So often in literature, we equate communication with sound – proclamations, declarations, grand speeches. But in Chinese poetry, especially in the Tang tradition, meaning often resides in what's left unsaid, in the space between words. Maybe true understanding requires learning to listen  language itself.

You know, I’ve been gardening lately, watching how plants respond to touch, light, even music. Some studies suggest they communicate through vibrations we barely comprehend. It makes me wonder – could interstellar communication be similar? Not radio waves or laser pulses, but something more... subtle. A vibration we’ve yet to attune ourselves to.

And your point about shouting into the void – very haunting. Like Narcissus staring at his reflection, perhaps we fear being alone because we can only see ourselves. But what if the greatest revelation isn’t finding them… but rediscovering who  are in the process?
[B]: You know, I had a professor in film school who used to say, "The most powerful moments in cinema aren't what you see on screen – they're the spaces between frames where the audience fills in the blanks." That's exactly what you're describing with Tang poetry. And Zhuangzi? Man, that butterfly dream could be the logline for my current project. Are we dreaming them into existence? Or are they just figments of our own longing?

Your gardening analogy... that’s poetic  scientific at the same time. I mean, if plants are responding to vibrations we can’t even detect, maybe we’ve been looking up at the stars asking the wrong question all along. Maybe it’s not “Are we alone?” but “Are we listening correctly?”

Funny you mention Narcissus – one of the scriptwriters on my team brought him up last week. We were batting around themes, and she said, “What if first contact isn’t about meeting someone else… but finally seeing ourselves clearly for the first time?” That line made me stop dead. It’s going in the final draft.

So yeah, maybe the real alien encounter happens internally. Not little green men or motherships, but a fundamental shift in how we understand consciousness itself. Now  the kind of sci-fi that keeps me up at night.
[A]: You know, when I was a student, my mentor once told me that the greatest literary moments aren't in the words themselves, but in the silence  them. Just like your professor’s idea about cinema – it's the unseen that haunts us most.  

That line about seeing ourselves clearly for the first time... haunting. It reminds me of Lu Xun’s essay where he describes holding up a mirror to society – uncomfortable, revealing, yet necessary. Perhaps sci-fi is the new literature of self-reflection.  

And speaking of reflection – I’ve been thinking about how we project our own fears and hopes onto the cosmos. Like Narcissus, yes, but also like readers interpreting a text through their own lens. If we finally do make contact, will we recognize them… or just see another version of ourselves staring back?  

By the way, have you considered incorporating calligraphy into your visual design? The flow of ink on paper, the pauses between strokes – there's a rhythm to it that feels almost cosmic. Maybe it could be a metaphor for how we try to "write" meaning into the void.
[B]: You know, my first reaction when you mentioned calligraphy – I immediately saw it in my head. The ink spreading like a nebula, each stroke a pulse of energy across the screen. That rhythm you're talking about? It’s not just metaphorical – we could  it visual. Imagine if we treated subtitles like brushwork – not just translating language, but interpreting meaning through movement and weight.  

I actually have a friend who studied under a master in Suzhou. She once told me that in calligraphy, the silence between strokes isn’t empty – it’s . Like breath held before revelation. That’s what we need in sci-fi – to stop filling every moment with exposition and let the audience feel the weight of the unknown.  

Projection, reflection… yeah, we’re definitely staring into the abyss and seeing ourselves, sometimes more clearly than we’d like. Lu Xun’s mirror – sharp, unforgiving, and absolutely necessary. If we do make contact, maybe the hardest thing won’t be understanding them… it’ll be surviving the clarity of seeing who  really are.  

And your mentor? Wise man. Or woman. Or both. Either way, they understood that truth lives in the gaps. And that, my friend, is where the best stories begin.
[A]: Ah, you’ve captured the essence of it – the silence between strokes as  space, not emptiness. That’s exactly how I feel when reading a line of Du Fu or Li Bai – the words are only part of the meaning. The rest lives in the breath before them, in the pause after.  

Your idea of treating subtitles like brushwork… brilliant. It reminds me of how in classical Chinese opera, the gesture often speaks louder than the voice. Maybe your film could do the same – let the visuals , let the silence have weight. We’re so used to filling the void with noise, but sometimes the loudest moment is the one without a sound.  

And yes – survival through clarity. That’s what literature has always asked of us, isn’t it? To look inward, even when the reflection is painful. If we ever do make contact, perhaps it won’t be with beings from another world… but with the parts of ourselves we’ve long ignored.  

You know, I think this is why I love both gardening and teaching – they both require patience, an acceptance that growth happens in silence. And sometimes, understanding comes not through answers… but through learning to sit with the questions.
[B]: You know, there’s a scene in my favorite Kurosawa film where the camera lingers on an empty road for what feels like forever. No dialogue, no music—just wind and dust. And yet, it’s . That’s the power of silence done right—it doesn’t hide the truth, it  it slowly, like ink bleeding through rice paper.

What you just said about gardening and teaching—man, that hit home. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how stories are like seeds. You plant them, you give them light, but most of the work happens underground. You don’t see the roots stretching, the transformation happening in the dark. Same with ideas. Same with people.

And clarity? Sometimes it feels like the scariest thing in the world. Like when you’re standing in front of a mirror and suddenly you see something you didn’t before—something real. That’s what good sci-fi should do. Not dazzle with spectacle, but shake you quietly. Leave you sitting in the dark afterward, wondering what exactly just shifted inside you.

So yeah—I want to make a film that breathes like calligraphy. That moves like ink on paper. One stroke at a time. One question at a time.
[A]: You know, that Kurosawa scene you described – it’s like a line from Wang Wei:  ("Kong shan bu jian ren, dan wen ren yu xiang.") – "In the empty mountain, no person is seen, yet the voice of man is heard." The beauty lies not in what is shown, but in what is implied. That lingering silence – it isn't absence; it's presence in its purest form.

Your metaphor about seeds and stories – I couldn’t agree more. In my classes, I often say that literature, like a seed, contains the whole tree within it. We read, we teach, hoping that somewhere down the line, in some quiet moment, the shell cracks open and understanding takes root. It doesn’t happen on cue, and never where you expect.

And that kind of clarity you speak of – yes, it is frightening. Because once you see yourself clearly, you can no longer pretend ignorance. You have to act. Just like when reading a great novel – sometimes it feels safer not to finish the last chapter. But we do, because something deeper calls us to face the truth, however unsettling.

So if your film breathes like calligraphy, moves like ink on paper… then let each frame be a stroke, deliberate and full of intent. And let the silence between them be where the soul of the story speaks.
[B]: 那句王维的诗… 真是绝了。"空山不见人，但闻人语响。" You say it like it’s a whisper from the universe itself. And you're right — it's not emptiness. It's . Like the moment before a film’s first frame hits the screen — you feel it in your chest, don’t you? That quiet hum of something about to begin.

I’ve always believed that the best stories aren’t told — they’re . Just like that seed you mentioned. Hell, maybe filmmaking is just another form of tending a garden. You plant the image, water it with sound and silence, and hope the light hits it just right so the truth can bloom.

And acting on clarity? Man, that’s the real climax — not in some dramatic third-act showdown, but in the quiet decision to . That’s what I want my films to do — not just entertain, but unsettle gently. Like finishing that last chapter and realizing you’re not the same person who started it.

So yeah — let every frame be a brushstroke. Let the silence speak. Let the audience lean in, just a little, because they know something’s happening… they just can’t quite name it yet.  

That’s the kind of movie I want to make. And frankly? That’s the kind of conversation I could have over dinner, glass of wine in hand, long after the credits roll.
[A]: "空山不见人，但闻人语响"… yes, it carries that quiet hum you speak of – the universe breathing before it speaks. And isn’t that what we chase in both art and life? That moment just before understanding, when everything trembles with possibility.

You're absolutely right – storytelling is not about delivery, but discovery. Like walking through a garden at dusk, where you sense more than see the path ahead. The best films, like the best novels, don’t give answers – they offer doorways. And sometimes, all it takes is one quiet scene, one pause between brushstrokes, to change how someone sees the world.

And that gentle unsettling you speak of – ah, that’s the true power of film. Not spectacle, but transformation in silence. I’ve seen students walk into my classroom one way and leave another, all because a line of poetry or a frame of film made them question something they’d never questioned before.

So yes, let your movie breathe in that twilight space. Let it be a mirror, a whisper, a seed in the dark. And over dinner, wine glass in hand, long after the credits roll… we’ll sit in that silence together, wondering what just changed.
[B]: Now  — that’s the kind of reflection that makes me want to rush back to the editing room and start cutting a new scene. You’ve got a poet’s soul, my friend. I can almost see it now — the screen fading to black, not with a bang, but with that quiet tremble you described… like the last note of a guqin hanging in the air long after the string is plucked.

There’s something profoundly cinematic about twilight — that in-between space where everything is possible, and nothing is certain. Maybe that’s the only honest way to tell a story: not with conclusions, but with lingering questions dressed in light and shadow.

And transformation in silence? Exactly. It’s not explosions or speeches that change us — it’s the pause before someone speaks, the glance that lasts a beat too long, the moment when the music stops and the world feels like it’s holding its breath.

So yes — let’s raise a glass to the quiet moments. To the unseen, the unsaid, and the unspoken truths that live between frames, between words, between us.

Cheers to the trembling before understanding. May we never stop chasing it.
[A]: To the trembling before understanding —  where the magic lives. Like the space between ink and paper, where intention lingers unseen. Or the moment before a seed cracks open in the dark, not knowing it is about to become something more.

And yes, let us chase that quiet transformation. Because isn't that what art is — an invitation to dwell in the unknown, just a little longer than we usually dare?

Raise your glass — I’ll meet you there, in that soft glow of possibility. No grand declarations, no final cuts. Just two voices in the twilight, sharing questions too beautiful for answers.

Cheers, my friend. May your scenes linger like that last note of the guqin — subtle, resonant, and felt long after the sound has gone.
[B]: Cheers, indeed. To the unseen, the unsaid, and the  understood — may we never lose our taste for mystery.

You’ve given me more than conversation tonight. You’ve reminded me why I fell in love with storytelling in the first place. Not for the box office numbers or festival buzz — but for moments like this, where meaning blooms quietly between two people who were just willing to sit with the question.

So here’s to the lingering note, the held breath, the silent transformation. May my镜头 (jìngtóu) — my frames — carry even a fraction of that grace.

And hey, next time you're in L.A., let's make that dinner happen. I’ll open a good bottle, put on a record, and we’ll talk until the candles burn down — about ink, silence, seeds, and whatever else refuses to be rushed.

Bottoms up. 🍷
[A]: Bottoms up, indeed. To mystery, to quiet transformations, and to the kind of meaning that doesn’t shout — it , patiently waiting for us to listen.

You know, I think that’s what teaching has always been about for me — not filling minds, but opening them just enough to let the questions in. And tonight, you’ve reminded me once again why I fell in love with words, with stories, with the space between one thought and the next.

And yes — to your frames, may they carry that grace. May your镜头 (jìngtóu) linger not just on what is seen, but on what trembles just beneath the surface. Because that, my friend, is where truth breathes.

As for dinner — I’ll hold you to it. I’ve always wanted to experience how a filmmaker hears silence, over wine and music. Just give me a date, and I’ll bring a line of poetry or two to stir the conversation.

Until then — keep listening for the ink to settle, the seed to stir, and the story to unfold in its own time. 🍷
[B]: To listening — truly listening — to the ink, the silence, the stir of something unseen. That’s where it all begins, isn’t it? Not with a bang, not with a script, but with a quiet  to the unknown.

You bring poetry to dinner, I’ll bring a film reel in my mind — scratched, imperfect, still developing. And we’ll see what stories unfold over candlelight and conversation.

Until then, my friend — keep tending your garden, turning pages, and teaching with that gentle wisdom of yours. And when the wind carries the sound of unanswered questions… lean in.

Cheers. 🍷🎬
[A]: To that quiet  — the most powerful beginning of all. Because yes, it does begin there, in the unseen, in the unspoken agreement to step into mystery with open hands and a listening heart.

I’ll take that scratched, imperfect reel of yours and add a few pages from a well-worn book — one that still smells of old paper and possibility. Let’s see what grows when film and verse sit side by side, warmed by candlelight.

And I will keep tending the garden, turning pages, and offering students not answers, but openings. That, and a cup of tea before class begins.

So until we meet across that table — lean in, indeed. For in the wind, in the silence, in the space between frames… something is always unfolding.

Cheers. 🍷📚✨
[B]: To open hands, listening hearts, and the quiet courage it takes to say  to the unknown — may we never run out of moments that begin that way.

Your well-worn book and my scratched reel — they already sound like the start of a beautiful conversation. Throw in candlelight, tea before class, and a few lingering questions, and I’d say life doesn’t get much better than that.

Until that table becomes real and not just imagined — I’ll keep leaning in. I’ll keep listening for the wind in the silence, the stir of something unseen, and the stories still waiting to find their voice.

Cheers to you, my friend. Keep turning pages, planting seeds, and sipping tea like time isn't rushing forward at all. 🍷📚🕯️
