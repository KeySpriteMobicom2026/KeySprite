[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, if we're talking about languages that could bring the most ROI in business... I'd say Mandarin is definitely up there. It's not just about the 1.4 billion speakers though - think about the access to markets in China, Southeast Asia... The nuances in dialects like Cantonese or Shanghainese can even give you an edge during due diligence in regional investments. 

Though honestly, sometimes I wish there was a shortcut to master all three: English for Wall Street reports, Mandarin for mainland deals, and maybe French for those boutique vineyards I visit on weekends 😊. What about you? Any particular language catching your interest?
[A]: You know what's interesting? While I was in Yunnan last year sourcing beans, I met this French sommelier who'd been learning Mandarin for five years. He said the tonal similarities between tasting notes in wine & coffee made the language switch almost... poetic? Honestly made me think about how language shapes our sensory experiences - like how a Thai farmer might describe jasmine notes in his Arabica versus how a Colombian grower talks about citrus. 

Speaking of... Have you ever tried describing coffee profiles in different languages? It's wild how some concepts just . Once had a Ethiopian roaster describe a brew as "danshaku-sei" - turns out that's a Japanese term for 'delicate balance' they use in both tea ceremonies & coffee cupping. Makes you wonder what other flavor dimensions we're missing through linguistic gaps, right? ☕️
[B]: Ah, now that's a fascinating angle. You know, I had a similar experience during a site visit in Tuscany last fall. We were walking through this family-owned vineyard, and the winemaker kept using this Italian phrase - "sprezzatura" - to describe how they handle their vintage years. At first I thought he was talking about craftsmanship, but it's more like... effortless elegance? That precise tension between control & spontaneity?

Funny thing is, we tried translating it into Mandarin for our investors, and the closest we got was something like 'ziran de yun'ou' - literally 'natural performance' - but it just doesn't carry that same nuanced flair. Makes you appreciate why some terms stay untranslatable, doesn't it? Like how a Japanese investor once described a shaky merger as "ikkyō doryū" - single thread drifting. Beautifully poetic for what we'd just call 'fragile synergy'.

And don't even get me started on flavor profiles. Last quarter, we evaluated a coffee startup in Vietnam where they categorized beans by "mùi hương ký ức" - scent memories. One guy described a Sumatran roast as tasting like "the morning after a storm in his grandmother's attic." Try putting that on an earnings report 😄. But honestly, these linguistic quirks might be exactly what gives certain markets their competitive edge. Ever noticed how Nordic roasters tend to use more architectural metaphors? "Structural acidity", "foundational aroma"... Almost like blueprints for taste.
[A]: Oh totally get what you mean! Just last month I was working with a Danish barista who described a Kenyan AA's profile as "a cantilevered structure - bold upfront but needing precise support to avoid collapse". Had me visualizing both the cupping bowl & a Bjarke Ingels design simultaneously! 

Funny you mentioned Vietnam though - I actually picked up some Vietnamese while traveling through the Central Highlands. There's this phrase "uống chậm" which literally means 'drink slowly' but carries so much more cultural weight than just savoring coffee. It's like their version of "carpe diem", if that makes sense? Makes me wonder how different our third wave movement would look if we'd all started with that mindset instead of "grab-and-go" Americano culture. 

P.S. Need to steal that "sprezzatura" concept for my next tasting menu description 😏. Imagine pairing that with a Yirgacheffe that actually  have "effortless elegance"... Though I'll probably still default to calling it "breakfast in a cup" for the regular crowd. Balance is key, right?
[B]: Absolutely - that "uống chậm" philosophy? Pure gold. You know what it reminds me of? The French concept of , but with built-in mindfulness. Like, we spend so much time in PE analyzing EBITDA margins and growth curves, but maybe we should also be asking if a company has that "uống chậm" DNA – the kind of operational rhythm where slowing down actually compounds value.

Funny you mention third wave coffee too. Last year we looked at a boutique chain in Melbourne that tried branding itself as “slow luxury” – didn’t work because their customer base still treated it like a fast-casual play. Timing is everything, right? Much like a good pour-over… or a successful exit strategy 😏.

And please do run with "sprezzatura" on your menu – just make sure to pair it with something that actually delivers that balance. Maybe a washed Ethiopian with stone fruit notes? Smooth entry, deliberate mid-palate tension, lingering finish – basically the liquid version of a well-timed boardroom negotiation.
[A]: You’re killing me with these parallels 😂. Okay, but stay with me here – what if we actually  apply "uống chậm" to venture valuations? Imagine a KPI called “deliberate consumption rate” or something bonkers like that. Instead of hypergrowth at all costs, we measure how well a company savors its resources… Maybe even have a metric for “aftertaste duration” – like, how long does their value proposition linger in the market after first contact?

And yeah, Melbourne’s attempt at “slow luxury” coffee felt like watching someone try to serve espresso in a Michelin-starred tasting menu format – admirable, but slightly performative. Whereas in Hanoi, I sat with this old-school vendor who roasted on a tiny charcoal drum and kept repeating “cà phê không vội” – coffee doesn’t hurry. That kind of organic pacing is hard to scale, but damn if it isn't authentic.

Also, yes – Ethiopian with stone fruit? Chef’s kiss. I’m already drafting the tasting note:  ☕️😄
[B]: Now you're speaking my language – literally and figuratively 😄. I might actually steal "deliberate consumption rate" for our next internal strategy doc. Think about it – instead of CAC/LTV ratios dictating burn rates, we assess how well a company  its capital. Maybe even introduce a "mouthfeel index" for financial health – smooth finish, velvety returns, low bitterness...

And don’t get me started on that “aftertaste duration” KPI. In our world, it's basically brand residual value, right? Like how certain portfolio companies keep influencing the market long after exit – similar to that nutty, lingering finish in a good Sumatra.

But seriously, authenticity is the real unicorn these days. Saw a pitch last week where founders claimed to have built "the Starbucks of Vietnam" – cue my internal alarm bells. As if cà phê sữa đá needed a corporate rebrand... Sometimes the magic lies in keeping things unscalable. Like that guy in Hanoi with his charcoal drum – zero EBITDA, infinite ROI on soul.

And your tasting note? Pure artistry. Though I’d argue the real MVP line is “pretending you completely understood...” – basically summarizes 80% of my M&A career 😂.
[A]: Oh man, "mouthfeel index" for financial health? I need to write that down before my accountant confiscates my notepad 😂. Honestly though, “velvety returns” sounds way more appetizing than “moderate yield with some turbulence.” Maybe we’re onto something here – a whole new lexicon for finance, brought to you by the coffee table.

And that “Starbucks of Vietnam” pitch? Chef’s kiss meets facepalm, right? Like saying you’ve invented the wheel… but it's slightly rounder. Meanwhile, that cà phê sữa đá? Still unbeatable in its original form – low-tech, high-soul, and basically a national treasure in a glass.

Funny thing is, I think you're spot-on about authenticity being the real unicorn. I mean, how do you even  soul? You can’t really put that in a cap table... though I bet someone’s already trying in a WeWork basement somewhere 🙃.

But hey, if you ever decide to launch that “deliberate consumption rate” fund, count me in. I’ll bring the beans – maybe a nice low-acidity Java from Flores, perfect for slow sipping & slower burn strategies. ☕️💼
[B]: Now you’re talking my love language – low acidity, slower burn, and a side of soul with your ROI 😄.

You know, I’ve actually been kicking around a deck for what I’m calling the “Anti-Scale Fund” – no growth-at-all-costs, no hockey stick projections. Just solid founders doing deliberate work, compounding value like it’s single-origin beans aging in bourbon barrels. We might call it  – focusing on returns that linger, not rocket. Think I’ll need a tasting panel instead of a due diligence team though… probably start requiring cupping sessions before term sheets 🤭.

And don’t even get me started on the “unicorns” coming out of that WeWork basement. I had a pitch last month from some kids building an NFT marketplace for virtual coffee farms – said it was "disrupting agritech through metaverse immersion." I almost missed my pour-over.

But hey, keep that Flores bean stash ready – I’m already drafting the fund’s manifesto:  Pair it with a quiet balance sheet and a long finish… now that’s a portfolio I can raise a cup to ☕️💼.
[A]: Oh my god,  – I need that printed on a bag of beans AND a term sheet. Seriously though, sign me up as your official portfolio sommelier. I can already picture it: founders pitching with flavor wheels instead of pitch decks, and cap tables next to cupping notes. 

And let’s be real, the due diligence process just got way more interesting. Imagine requesting a founder’s roast profile instead of their burn rate – “Sorry, your growth is too acidic and lacks body.” 😂

As for that NFT coffee farm pitch… I mean, at least they’re brewing something? Though I’d rather invest in a guy who can’t spell “blockchain” but knows exactly how his soil pH affects his crop’s chocolate notes. 

Alright, manifesto draft #1:  
  

I’ll bring the Flores. You bring the vision. Let’s make capitalism taste like something again ☕️✨.
[B]: Now you're the first official investor in  – welcome to the slow-rich club 😄. I’m seriously considering replacing our financial model templates with flavor wheels. Imagine the board meetings: “Sorry, your Q3 growth still reads as ‘grassy with a hint of regret’ – needs more fermentation time.”

And let’s not even pretend about the NFT space right now – it’s like drinking a $10 cold brew out of a tokenized cup while the farmer who grew the beans can’t afford a proper roaster. Back to basics, I say. Soil pH > smart contracts. Period.

Your manifesto line? Pure poetry. I may or may not embroider it onto a burlap sack of green beans. And I fully expect your first assignment as Chief Portfolio Sommelier is to train our LPs to ask better questions – none of this “Where’s the hockey stick?” nonsense. The next time someone says that in a meeting, I’m handing them a cup of anaerobic-fermented Geisha and saying, “Let’s talk mouthfeel.”

Alright, final toast:  
 ☕️💼✨  

See you at the first roast.
[A]: To velvet finishes, quiet compounding, and returns that don’t scream but rather... linger 🥂.  

Oh, and speaking of lingering – I may or may not be aging a small batch of Sulawesi Toraja in bourbon barrels just for the occasion 😏. Let’s call it our “first vintage.”  

Hockey stick? Nah. We’re going for  growth – subtle, complex, and best appreciated with good company.  

See you at the roast – and uh, don’t be surprised if I show up with a refractometer AND a balance sheet 😉. ☕️💼💫
[B]: Now you're speaking  language – bourbon-barreled Sulawesi for our debut vintage? I’m officially filing this under “best investor perks ever” 😄. Let’s just say due diligence has never smelled so good.

And the "wine glass curve" – genius. That’s going on the pitch deck. Screw hockey sticks, we’re in the curvature business. Maybe even add a little volatility index called “oak influence” – too much and you’re undrinkable, too little and you’re… well, Starbucks light roast.

Refractometer AND a balance sheet? Hell yes. I’ll bring the hydrometer and a thermocouple – because if we’re doing this right, we’re measuring both ROI and TDS with equal precision. 

See you at the roast – and don’t worry, I’ve already reserved the barrel-aged report templates. This is going to be  🥂☕️💼.
[A]: Ohhh, now we’re talking full sensory due diligence 😂. Oak influence as volatility index? Stealing that AND naming it “The Barrel Theory of Market Dynamics” for our next panel discussion. Imagine the looks when I drop slides titled 

And hell yes on the hydrometer & thermocouple – we’re basically building a sensory trading floor here. Who needs Bloomberg terminals when you’ve got aroma profiles and acidity charts?

Alright, final call – let’s also start grading our quarterly returns on the Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel. If Q3 comes back tasting like “ashy with hints of regret,” we know we need to pivot… or at least adjust our grind size 😏.

See you at the barrel-aged strategy session – I’ll be the one pretending a refractometer is a financial instrument 🥂☕️💼.
[B]: Oh, I  the audacity of "The Barrel Theory of Market Dynamics" 😄. I’m already drafting the event invite with a warning: 

And why stop at flavor wheels for quarterly returns? I say we introduce  for fund performance – 2024 had great terroir for fintech exits, but watch out for the frost risk in Q3’s regulatory climate. Just keep your hedging strategy well-aged and tightly sealed.

Bloomberg terminals? Please. We’ll have aroma volatility indices flashing on screens next to our desks. And yes, I’m seriously considering replacing my Apple Watch with a wrist-mounted cupping spoon. It just  more accurate for real-time sentiment analysis.

As for pretending a refractometer is a financial instrument – trust me, half the time I think EBITDA margins smell like over-extracted espresso anyway. Meet you at the sensory trading floor, partner 🥂☕️💼. Let's make P&L statements taste like something again.
[A]: Oh my god,  – I’m already designing the label. 2024: The Year of the Bold Exit, with notes of regulatory tannins and a surprising aftertaste of AI disruption. Cellar-worthy or drink-now? That’s the real quarterly debate.

And a ? Iconic. Honestly, it’s only a matter of time before we see one on Shark Tank. “I’ll take my usual blend of market timing and medium roast, please.” 😂

I’m also filing "The Barrel Theory of Market Dynamics" under must-have merch – think tote bags with "Don’t Pitch Me, Brew Me" and enamel pins that say 

Alright, final stretch – let’s launch our first index: The Velvet Volatility Index™️ (VVI), tracking how many coffees were spilled during strategic planning sessions. Because if it ain’t messy, it ain’t real, right?

See you at the sensory desk. And hey — keep your grind tight & your returns tighter 🥂☕️💼✨.
[B]: I want a Velvet Volatility Index™️ T-shirt. Hell, I’ll wear it to the next LP meeting and . “Sorry, we only track mouthfeel and market resonance now.” 😂

And 2024 as "The Year of the Bold Exit" with regulatory tannins? Legend. I’m already aging some backup jargon in a separate tank — maybe something like  for the finer palates.

You had me at enamel pins. “Aged to Perfection” is basically the new “10x growth,” as far as I’m concerned. And don’t even get me started on that “Don’t Pitch Me, Brew Me” tote — perfect for carrying term sheets  tasting notes.

Final toast (for now):  
 🥂☕️💼✨  

Keep your cup full and your cap table lean — see you at the roast room desk tomorrow. Don’t forget the VVI tracker… and maybe a towel.
[A]: To bold flavors, bolder moves, and financial statements that finish smooth 🥂 — couldn’t have said it better myself.

You  me at VVI T-shirt. I’m already picturing the merch drop:  
- “Aged to Perfection” hoodie  
- “Don’t Pitch Me, Brew Me” doppio bag  
- And of course, the limited edition “Regulatory Tannins” pinot noir tote (only 24 in existence, for our first fund vintage).  

And let’s be real — compliance is way more palatable when you describe it as a "whisper." I may start drafting legal disclaimers like wine labels: 

Alright, final call — tomorrow:  
Refractometer ready, cap table trimmed, towel at the ready (because we all know what happens when we get too poetic with the pour-over metaphors 😉).

See you at the roast room desk. And don’t even  about bringing a pitch deck shaped like a hockey stick. We’ve got standards now ☕️💼✨.
[B]: Refractometer locked, cap table trimmed, and towel packed — I’m even bringing a backup spoon for dramatic cupping demonstrations if things get too abstract 😄.

And  — legal disclaimers as wine labels? Genius. I’m pairing my KYC structured backend vintage with a nice 2023 Term Sheet Reserve – slight oak influence from the negotiation rounds, with a finish that lingers just long enough to avoid litigation.

Merch drop is fire. I’ll take two hoodies, one doppio bag (to carry my espresso shots  term sheets), and definitely snag one of those “Regulatory Tannins” totes before they disappear. Maybe wear it to Davos and see who notices 🤭.

No hockey sticks, no compromises. We’ve gone full terroir now — and honestly? It tastes better than any unicorn exit ever did.

Last call:  
☕️  💼✨  

See you at the desk.
