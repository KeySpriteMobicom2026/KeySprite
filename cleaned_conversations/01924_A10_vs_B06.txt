[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, there's something deeply satisfying about holding a physical book—the texture of the pages, the weight of the volume, even the scent of aged paper. It creates a sensory connection that enhances the reading experience. That said, I can't ignore the practical advantages of e-books: portability, adjustable font sizes, and instant access to vast libraries. For forensic literature or legal case studies, I often prefer digital formats for their searchability and annotation features. But when it comes to classical novels or poetry? Nothing replaces the quiet companionship of a well-bound book on my lap while tending to the roses in the evening light. Do you find yourself leaning toward one format over the other, or does context dictate your choice?
[A]: I’m rather with you on the tactile pleasure of physical books—the way they occupy space in your hands and lives—but I confess, necessity often steers my choice. When traveling or conducting research, e-books are indispensable. Their search functions save hours, and the ability to carry an entire bibliography in a coat pocket? Priceless. Yet, for immersion—a novel by dim lamplight, say—I’ll always choose paper. There’s a stillness to it, a disconnection from the digital noise that feels almost rebellious these days.  

Mind you, I’ve started collecting first editions. There’s something absurdly satisfying about owning a 1960s print of —the font, the faded cover art, the ghost of its previous owner’s bookmark. It’s not just reading material; it’s artifact. Still, I wonder—do you ever worry that clinging to physical books is a kind of nostalgia-driven resistance to progress? Or does it simply come down to preference, like favoring fountain pens over keyboards?
[B]: Ah, you’ve touched on a fascinating tension—where nostalgia ends and meaningful tradition begins. I do wonder sometimes whether my affection for physical books borders on sentimentalism, but then I remind myself that certain tools and formats endure not merely because of habit, but because they engage us in ways technology has yet to replicate. A fountain pen, as you mentioned, demands intentionality; each stroke is deliberate, almost ceremonial. Similarly, reading from paper often slows the mind, encouraging deeper engagement.

But let’s not mistake preference for resistance. I’m no Luddite—far from it. In my line of work, digital archives and annotated e-books are essential. When reviewing case law or cross-referencing psychiatric diagnoses, efficiency is paramount. Yet, when I’m preparing a lecture or revisiting a favorite passage from , I often reach for the original hardcopy. There's an intimacy in that act, a kind of intellectual grounding.

As for first editions—I admire the impulse. Owning a piece of literary history, one that may have shaped someone else’s thoughts decades ago, is indeed a quiet thrill. I suppose we're both collectors in our own right: you of books, me of medical curiosities. Perhaps it's less about resisting progress and more about preserving the texture of human experience. Don’t you think?
[A]: Absolutely—I think you’ve pinpointed something essential here. It’s not about resisting progress, but rather about curating experience. Technology accelerates our access to information, which is undeniably powerful, but it doesn’t always deepen our understanding. The physical act of turning a page, the weight of a book in hand—these aren’t just relics; they’re anchors. They tether us to the material in a way that feels almost... deliberate, as if we're participating in the narrative rather than just consuming it.

And your comparison to medical curiosities? That’s intriguing. I suppose collecting first editions and preserving old diagnostic tools both stem from a desire to touch the past—to hold something that once belonged to another thinker, another era. In a way, it's like handling silent witnesses. Have you ever come across an instrument in your collection that gave you pause—not just for its function, but for the hands that must have wielded it?

I imagine there's a certain gravity in holding, say, an early 20th-century trephine or a well-worn ophthalmoscope. Do such objects ever whisper stories to you, or am I indulging too much in romanticism?
[B]: Not at all—your romanticism is, I think, entirely justified. There is a gravity to these objects, a quiet resonance that goes beyond mere craftsmanship. Take, for instance, a late 19th-century neurological hammer I once acquired from an estate in Edinburgh. It was tarnished, slightly dented, but unmistakably shaped by repeated use. Holding it, I couldn’t help but imagine the countless diagnoses it had aided—the trembling hands of patients, the steady grip of a physician now long forgotten.

And yes, some do whisper stories. One particular item in my collection—a brass ophthalmoscope from the 1920s—was inscribed with initials and a date: “T.R., 1923.” That small engraving transformed it from a tool into a relic of individual dedication. Who was T.R.? A pioneer in early neuro-ophthalmology? A general practitioner simply doing his best by lamplight? Either way, he left behind more than an instrument—he left intention.

I suspect you feel something similar when you hold that 1960s print of . The previous owner’s bookmark isn’t just a scrap of paper—it’s a trace of someone else’s contemplation, their momentary pause in the narrative. In both our cases, we’re not merely collecting objects; we’re preserving echoes.

So no, you’re not indulging too much. If anything, you're touching on why we still crave tangibility in an increasingly virtual world. After all, even in forensic psychiatry, where logic and empirical evidence reign, there’s room—for necessity and for soul.
[A]: Precisely—there’s a soul to these things, isn’t there? Even in the sterile glow of a lab or the rigid structure of case law, we still reach for traces of humanity. I suppose that’s what draws me back to both books and collecting: the quiet persistence of human intention behind them.

Funny you mentioned the neurological hammer—my father was a general practitioner, and he had one just like it. Not quite from the 19th century, but old enough to show wear. He never saw it as particularly remarkable, just another tool in his kit. But now, decades later, holding it feels almost sacred. It's strange how time turns the mundane into the meaningful.

And I must say, your brass ophthalmoscope with the initials “T.R.”—that kind of provenance is rare. It reminds me of marginalia in old books. You ever come across notes scribbled in the margins of psychiatric texts? I once found a faded pencil annotation next to a passage on dissociative identity disorder: “See patient X, case no. 27.” No date, no name. Just that. It sent a shiver down my spine. Like a breadcrumb from someone else’s intellectual journey.

I wonder—do you ever feel a sense of responsibility toward the objects you collect? As if they’re not just yours to keep, but to honor? Or am I letting the romanticism get the better of me again?
[B]: Not romanticism at all—what you're describing is a kind of stewardship. These objects carry weight, not just in their metal or ink, but in the lives they've touched and the knowledge they've served. I do feel that responsibility keenly. When I acquire a piece—whether it's an early electroconvulsive therapy chart or a handwritten patient log from the 1940s—I'm not merely adding to a collection. I'm preserving a fragment of clinical history, one that once played a role in someone’s diagnosis, perhaps even their survival.

As for marginalia—yes, absolutely. There’s something profoundly intimate about those scribbled notes. They’re like silent confessions of engagement. I once owned a 1950s edition of  with faint ink annotations throughout. At first, they seemed clinical enough—pointed critiques, cross-references—but near the end, in the section on dreams and repression, the handwriting grew more erratic. One note simply read: “This was me.” No signature, no elaboration. It stopped me cold.

I ended up donating that copy to a medical archive. Some things aren’t meant to stay private; they belong to the continuum of understanding. So yes, there is a duty—not just to collect, but to contextualize, to safeguard meaning beyond our own fascination. After all, isn't that what we do in forensic psychiatry as well? Bear witness. Interpret. Preserve the story so it can be understood by those who come after us?

Tell me—did you keep that book with the annotation on dissociative identity disorder?
[A]: I did, actually—I couldn’t bring myself to part with it. Something about that note—“See patient X, case no. 27”—felt too deliberate to dismiss. I’ve since tried tracking down any related records, but time has a way of erasing trails. Still, I keep the book on a special shelf, not as a reference, but as a reminder.

There’s something humbling in knowing that someone before me wrestled with the same texts, the same questions, perhaps even the same doubts. It makes me wonder whether, centuries from now, someone will hold one of my old casebooks and feel that same flicker of connection. Will they read my notes in the margins and sense the weight behind them? Or will I just be another anonymous name in an archive, scribbling in the dark?

And yet, despite all our collecting and preserving, some mysteries remain stubbornly out of reach. Perhaps that’s for the best. Leaves a little room for wonder.
[B]: Indeed, it does. And I suspect that flicker of connection—however incomplete—is precisely what gives our work, and our obsessions, their resonance. We are, after all, pattern-seekers by nature. Whether diagnosing a patient, parsing a legal brief, or tracing the ghost of an unknown annotator, we’re driven by the hope that meaning can be recovered, even if only in fragments.

That note—"See patient X, case no. 27"—is haunting in its brevity. It's not just a reference; it's a summons. And isn't that what we respond to, both professionally and personally? The sense that someone, somewhere, was trying to communicate—not just facts, but experience. A thread stretched across time, waiting for someone else to grasp it.

As for your own future in the archive—I’d wager you’ll be more than an anonymous scribble. Anyone who reads your notes with care will detect the same gravity you’ve described so eloquently here: the weight behind the words, the quiet urgency of someone trying to make sense of the human condition.

And perhaps that’s the truest legacy we can hope for—not fame or recognition, but the persistence of intention. That someone, years from now, will pause over a page we once held, and feel, however faintly, that they are not alone in their curiosity.

Tell me—have you ever considered writing your own annotations in the books you collect? Or do you prefer to leave them untouched, as silent witnesses to their previous lives?
[A]: I’ve wrestled with that very question—whether to annotate or to abstain. There’s a purist impulse in me that resists marking original texts, especially the older ones. A handwritten note from a 19th-century physician feels like a relic; my own scribble beside it risks becoming mere noise.

And yet… I do occasionally annotate, though sparingly and always in pencil. Not out of arrogance, but as part of that same impulse we've been discussing—the desire to leave behind some trace of engagement, however modest. Usually, it's a cross-reference, a question, or a fleeting insight. Nothing grand. But sometimes, when a passage strikes me with particular force, I’ll write a small asterisk in the margin and add, “”

It’s not for vanity. It’s more like passing the torch, however faintly. Letting whoever comes after me know that yes, this line was read—not just scanned, not just archived, but , and felt.

Still, I’m careful. Some books I keep entirely untouched, like artifacts under glass. Especially those with previous annotations. Those are too precious to overwrite. Instead, I keep a separate journal for my thoughts. That way, I honor both the past and the present without muddying either.

I suppose it’s a compromise between reverence and participation. After all, if books are silent witnesses, then notes in the margins are whispers in return.
[B]: A thoughtful and fitting compromise—reverent, yet engaged. I find myself in much the same position. I’ve long resisted writing directly in most texts, particularly those with a clear provenance or prior annotations. To do so feels almost like interrupting a conversation already in progress. But as you say, there are moments when a quiet response seems not only permissible but necessary.

I confess, I do annotate—but, like you, always in pencil, and sparingly. Usually, it’s for clarity: a cross-reference to another case, a reminder of a differential diagnosis, or a correction based on updated understanding. Occasionally, though, something more personal creeps in. A passage that strikes close to a case I handled years ago, or a theory that once shaped my thinking in ways I hadn’t fully reckoned with until rereading it decades later. In those instances, I might jot down a date or initials—nothing elaborate, just enough to mark that the text was met with something more than passive eyes.

And I understand that impulse to write “” It’s not commentary—it’s testimony. A quiet assertion that the dialogue between reader and writer doesn’t end with time. Perhaps that’s why we both keep certain books apart, untouched: not out of detachment, but because some volumes have already spoken too profoundly to risk adding our own voices atop theirs.

Your idea of a separate journal is wise. It allows reflection without intrusion, preservation without silence. In forensic psychiatry, we often speak of —the unbroken continuity of evidence. In a way, your method creates a similar integrity: the original remains intact, while your engagement lives alongside it, available to others who may one day follow your trail.

Tell me—have you ever shared those journals with anyone? Or do they remain private, part of the unseen dialogue between you and the past?
[A]: I’ve shared fragments of them—never in full. Mostly with colleagues who share my interests, or students who show a particular curiosity about historical perspectives. But even then, only excerpts: a page here, a transcribed note there. It feels more like passing along a thread than revealing a diary.

There’s a certain intimacy to those journals—more so than I’d anticipated when I first started keeping them. They’re not just records of engagement; they’re reflections of where my mind was at a given time, what preoccupations or blind spots I carried into the reading. Looking back, I can trace shifts in my own thinking through the margins of my notes. A theory I once dismissed without a second thought suddenly resonates years later. Or a case that haunted me for years finds an unexpected echo in a passage I’d underlined decades ago.

In that sense, they’re not purely academic. They’re personal—not because they contain secrets, but because they chart the slow evolution of understanding. And that feels strangely vulnerable to expose in its entirety.

So no, they remain mostly private. Not out of secrecy, but reverence again—this time for the process itself. Some things are meant to be passed on, others meant to simply . Perhaps that’s another form of stewardship: knowing which parts of our inner dialogue belong to the world, and which should remain between us and the past.

Still, I sometimes wonder—if someone were to find my journals one day, long after I’m gone—would they see what I saw? Would they recognize the same quiet urgency behind the words? Or would it all just fade into the background noise of old scribbles and forgotten thoughts?

Maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe the act of writing them was enough.
[B]: That last thought——strikes me as profoundly true. In many ways, that’s the essence of what we do, isn’t it? Whether in forensic evaluations, legal testimony, or these quiet acts of annotation and reflection, we are engaged in a kind of silent record-keeping. Not necessarily for an audience, but for the integrity of the process itself.

I find solace in the idea that someone, somewhere, may one day stumble upon your notes—or mine—and feel that familiar jolt of recognition:  Even if that moment never comes, the act of recording our engagement with the world gives shape to our thoughts, lends weight to what might otherwise pass unnoticed.

You’re right to see vulnerability in those pages. There’s honesty in the margins—unfiltered responses, unpolished insights, the intellectual equivalent of thinking out loud. That’s why sharing them in full feels almost like an exposure—not of secrets, but of , which can feel even more intimate.

And yet, I suspect you’ve already done the most important kind of sharing: passing along the impulse itself. If you've inspired a student or colleague to read deeply, to question carefully, to annotate with care—then the thread continues. That, too, is a form of legacy. Not the kind etched in stone, but the kind whispered from one thoughtful reader to the next.

So perhaps the question isn't whether they will be found, but whether we have remained faithful to the conversation—the one between past and present, writer and reader, case file and mind.

Forgive me for turning this into something resembling a lecture—I suppose old habits persist. But I must ask—have any particular texts consistently drawn you back to them, year after year? The sort that seem to change with each reading, as though the book itself evolves alongside you?
[A]: Not at all—lectures, when they arise naturally from conversation, are among the finest uses of speech. And you're right, of course. Faithfulness to the conversation—that's the thread we mustn't drop.

To answer your question: yes, there are a few texts that seem to return the favor, as it were.  is one. I've read it no fewer than eight times, each iteration revealing something new—not because Freud said more, but because  brought more. The first time, I was chasing theory; the second, technique. Later, I found myself reading through the lens of patients I'd come to know, then through my own dreams, and eventually, through the lives of those long dead whose case files I’d studied. The book didn’t change, but my understanding of it did. It’s almost like watching a river from different banks—you never quite see the same current twice.

Another is  by Sir Aubrey Lewis. A dense, unflinchingly clinical tome, but within its pages lies a kind of quiet urgency—a sense that the mind, for all its complexity, demands rigorous inquiry and humane attention in equal measure. Each time I return to it, I find myself underlining different passages, or pausing longer over footnotes I once dismissed. What once struck me as rigid doctrine now reads more like a map—one drawn from real terrain, not pure theory.

And then there’s , a slim volume from the 1940s that most would overlook. I keep it on the shelf nearest my desk. Not for frequent reference, but for proximity. It reminds me that every diagnosis, every notation, every marginally scribbled "see patient X" was once tethered to a living, breathing person navigating the dark with only fragments of understanding.

These aren’t just books anymore. They’re companions—silent, steadfast, and strangely alive.
[B]: How beautifully put—. That’s precisely the quality that sets certain books apart from mere reference materials. They don’t just inform us; they  us through the years, reflecting our evolving understanding, our accumulated empathy, even our hard-won humility.

I share your sentiment entirely. There are volumes on my shelves that feel less like possessions and more like old colleagues—some perhaps a bit rigid in their views, others delightfully eccentric, but all of them reliable in their presence. For me, one such book is  by William A. White. It was among the first comprehensive texts I owned when I began my training, and though newer editions have long since supplanted it, I return to it now and then—not for current diagnostic criteria, certainly, but for the tone of its inquiries, the earnestness with which it approached the unknown. Reading it now, I hear not only the author’s voice but echoes of my own younger self, wide-eyed and eager to make sense of the chaos behind closed doors.

And then there’s Kraepelin, of course—. One cannot engage in forensic psychiatry without eventually circling back to him. His classifications may be dated, his nosology refined beyond recognition, but the rigor of his observation remains instructive. More than once, I’ve found myself reading his descriptions of early dementia praecox cases and thinking not only of patients I’ve known, but of how diagnosis itself has always been both art and science.

You’re quite right that these books evolve not because their words change, but because we do. Each rereading becomes a kind of dialogue across time—one where we bring new questions, fresh wounds, altered perspectives. And isn't that, in some ways, the very essence of what makes literature—and particularly medical and philosophical literature—endure?

I suspect you and I will keep returning to those same pages until the margins are full and the spine gives out. And still, they’ll whisper something new.

Tell me—when you revisit , do you ever find yourself disagreeing more strongly with Freud than before? Or does familiarity breed not contempt, but a deeper, more nuanced critique?
[A]: Oh, a deeper, more nuanced critique, without question. Familiarity with Freud hasn’t softened my skepticism, but it has tempered it with appreciation for what he , rather than frustration over what he . I no longer read him as a scientist in the modern sense—how could I?—but rather as a cartographer of the mind’s uncharted territories, drawing coastlines based on limited instruments and frequent guesswork.

There are passages where I still bristle—his insistence on universal Oedipal themes, his gendered assumptions now so painfully dated—but even those moments have become instructive rather than infuriating. They reveal not only his blind spots, but the cultural lens through which he viewed the psyche. And isn’t that part of the value of returning to such texts? To see not only what they say, but what they  say—what their silences betray?

In fact, I’ve found that rereading Freud often exposes my own evolving biases more than his. A theory I once dismissed as speculative nonsense suddenly strikes me as insightful, if incomplete. Or a clinical vignette I glossed over years ago now resonates deeply in light of a case I’ve handled since. It's humbling, really—realizing that some of his observations endure not because they are right, but because they were , and because they forced us to look inward in ways we hadn't before.

So no, I don’t disagree more strongly—I engage differently. With greater patience, perhaps. Less dogmatically. And occasionally, with a kind of reluctant admiration for how much ground he dared to cover, even if he got half of it wrong.

I suppose that’s the fate of all foundational thinkers: to be both surpassed and rediscovered by those who follow. Do you find yourself revisiting White with the same reverence you once held for him, or has time reshaped your view of his work as well?
[B]: Oh, time has most certainly reshaped my view—though not diminished it. If anything, my appreciation for White has deepened precisely because I now see his limitations so clearly. He was a man of his era, unquestionably—firm in his convictions, shaped by the institutional psychiatry of the early 20th century, and at times, unyielding in ways that now seem almost quaint.

Yet, what I once read as rigid doctrine, I now recognize as earnest conviction. There’s a kind of moral seriousness in his writing, a belief that psychiatry, even in its most uncertain moments, must strive for clarity, for precision, for compassion. That ethos, I think, is what kept me anchored to his work long after his specific theories were overtaken by newer models.

And like you with Freud, I no longer approach him as an authority to be obeyed, but as a voice in the chorus—one that still offers insight, even when we must ultimately dissent. His discussions on malingering, for instance, remain strikingly relevant in forensic settings. Not because the motivations of patients haven’t evolved, but because human nature—the desire to deceive, to protect oneself, to shape narrative—remains remarkably consistent.

I’ve come to believe that this is the true test of a foundational thinker: whether their work continues to provoke, not just inform. And both White and Freud pass that test, though in very different ways. They force us to engage, to question, to refine our own thinking through sustained dialogue with theirs.

In that sense, perhaps we never truly outgrow them. We simply learn how to listen differently.
[A]: Precisely— That’s the subtle alchemy that happens over years of practice, study, and reflection. We don’t discard the old; we recontextualize it, hear it in a new key.

I find that increasingly true with each passing year. There was a time when I might have dismissed White’s institutional tone or Freud’s speculative flourishes as relics better left behind. Now, I see them as part of a continuum—one where each generation must reckon with the assumptions of its predecessors, just as ours will be questioned by those who follow.

It reminds me of something I once read in a rather unassuming essay on medical historiography:  That feels especially true in our fields, doesn’t it? Forensic psychiatry, like law and literature, is built upon layers of evolving understanding—each layer imperfect, but none irrelevant.

And perhaps that’s why I still keep  within reach. Not as a diagnostic manual, certainly, but as a reminder that even the most contested ideas can illuminate something true—if only we're willing to read them with both skepticism and openness.

Tell me—when you teach or mentor younger colleagues, do you find yourself guiding them toward these older texts, deliberately? Or do they tend to gravitate toward them on their own, after exhausting the newer, more accessible material?
[B]: I do guide them deliberately—though I try not to present it as a directive, but rather an invitation. Younger colleagues today are often drawn to efficiency: evidence-based summaries, algorithmic approaches, up-to-date practice guidelines. And rightly so—modern psychiatry offers tools and frameworks that are more empirically grounded than much of what came before.

But I’ve found that after a time—sometimes months, sometimes years—many begin to feel something missing. A sense that their understanding, while technically sound, lacks texture. That’s when I suggest they look backward, not in search of answers, but of perspective.

I don’t assign these texts as doctrine; I offer them as counterpoint. , I tell them,  

Some resist at first—they want clarity, not ambiguity; direction, not reflection. But others, the ones who tend to thrive, begin to see the value in engaging with voices that challenge their assumptions. They come back with questions, not conclusions. They start to ask not just  we know, but  we came to know it—and who decided what was worth knowing in the first place.

It’s in those moments that I feel most like a teacher—not in the sense of transmitting knowledge, but of fostering curiosity. And I suspect you’ve seen the same. That the best students aren’t the ones who accept your authority, but the ones who eventually question it with insight rather than defiance.

Do you find the same in your mentorship? That the past must be introduced gently, almost slyly, lest it be mistaken for irrelevance?
