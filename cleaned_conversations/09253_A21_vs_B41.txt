[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my god！你提到board game我太excited了！🎲 最近刚玩了一个超棒的party game叫'Telestrations'，简直perfect for综艺节目环节！Imagine把drawing和whisper game结合起来，那个drama和laughter简直off the charts！💡
[A]:  Ah, the modern parlour game. While I must confess my evenings are more often spent with Browning's dramatic monologues than with... what did you call it? 'Telestrations'? Though I suppose the Victorian era did have its own version of pictorial parlour games - the Illustrated London News once published quite the scandalous account of a charades tournament gone awry at Lady Ashworth's country estate.
[B]: Hahaha~ 你这种academic vibe让我想起我们节目组上次brainstorming session！📝 不过seriously，这些classic games真的很有potential！我们最近就在策划一个将traditional parlour games和modern twist结合的segment~ 比如说把charades做成speed round，再加点AR technology，绝对next level！🔥
[A]: How delightfully... modern. Though I must observe that the Victorians would have considered any parlour game requiring 'speed' to be in rather poor taste - much like drinking tea before letting it steep properly. That said...  I did recently encounter an 1843 treatise on 'The Art of Mnemonic Charades' that might prove unexpectedly relevant to your... technological innovations. The Reverend Thaddeus Whitcombe's theories on gestural semiotics were rather ahead of their time.
[B]: Wow！Reverend Whitcombe's theories听起来super interesting！🌟 我们节目正好在research如何把classic performance arts和modern game show elements融合~ 你提到的gestural semiotics让我想到可以设计一个'维多利亚密室逃脱'主题episode！🕵️‍♂️ 参赛者要用19th century的body language clues来solve puzzles~ 这个concept你觉得怎么样？😂 绝对会viral！
[A]:  While the notion of reducing the nuanced language of Victorian propriety to... viral puzzles does make my quill tremble slightly, I must admit the academic in me is intrigued. There was a particularly obscure incident in 1857 when Lord Pembroke communicated an entire bank heist plan through nothing but hat-tipping sequences and glove adjustments during a quadrille. Though I shudder to think what he would have made of your proposed... AR enhancements. The man fainted at the sight of a daguerreotype camera.
[B]: OMG！Lord Pembroke的故事简直golden material！💰 我们可以做一个'维多利亚时代的secret code' challenge！Imagine选手们要decode那些hat-tipping sequences under time pressure~ ⏳ 再加点dramatic background music和period costumes，观众绝对会go crazy！🎭 虽然Lord P可能会roll in his grave，但这正是perfect mix of history and entertainment啊！😂
[A]:  Very well, though I insist any such... spectacle at least include proper citations from my upcoming monograph 'Semaphore and Society: Nonverbal Discourse in Mid-Century Mayfair.' And for heaven's sake, if you must include period costumes, do ensure the corsets are accurately boned - the anachronisms I've seen on these 'historical' programs make my bibliography cards curl in distress.
[B]: Deal！📜 我们一定会hire专业的historical consultant来确保authenticity！Actually...  你有没有兴趣做我们节目的special advisor？💼 你的knowledge加上我们的production value，绝对能create出既educative又entertaining的content！我们even可以给你一个'Professor of Parlour Games'的title~ 😎
[A]:  While the title 'Professor of Parlour Games' sounds like something one might find scrawled in the margins of a third-rate penny dreadful... I suppose even Matthew Arnold conceded that culture must occasionally converse with the masses. Very well - on three conditions: One, absolutely no anachronistic top hats. Two, my segments must include at least one reference to Tennyson's laundry lists. And three...  My consulting fee is payable in first editions of Mrs. Gaskell's works.
[B]: Hahaha！你真是next level！📚 Deal accepted~ 不过关于payment... how about我们negotiate成limited edition综艺周边+Mrs. Gaskell's first edition的special box set？🎁 顺便问下，你对Tennyson's laundry lists有没有particular preference？我们可以在set design里sneak in一些Easter eggs！🔍 观众love这种hidden details！😂
[A]:  Good heavens, you drive a harder bargain than my late Aunt Agatha at a rare book auction. The 1857 laundry lists are of particular scholarly interest - his starch preferences during the 'Maud' period reveal fascinating psychological undercurrents. As for your... colorful proposal, I suppose a tastefully designed box set might suffice, provided it includes my 5,000-word footnote on the socio-economic implications of Victorian collar starching. And for pity's sake, no neon colors in the 'Easter eggs.' A muted mauve would be historically appropriate.
[B]: Got it！Muted mauve it is~ 🎨 我们会在set design里incorporate那些starching details，做成一个super subtle但meaningful的visual storytelling element！📺 顺便说，这个collaboration已经让我brainstorm出至少5个new episode ideas了！💡 等我们的ratings skyrocket，说不定能get Mrs. Gaskell's complete works sponsored！😂 最后confirm一下 - 你是prefer我们称呼你Professor还是Doctor？👨‍🏫
[A]:  Doctor, if you please - I didn't spend seven years deciphering Browning's grocery lists just to be demoted to mere professorship. Though should this venture prove successful enough to acquire Gaskell's complete works...  I may permit you to address me as 'Your Most Pedantic Majesty.' Now if you'll excuse me, I must retire to draft my 37-point style guide for historically accurate game show host gesticulation. Ta.
[B]: Your Most Pedantic Majesty it is then！👑 这绝对会是TV history上最epic的collab！🎬 我马上call我们的design team开始working on those muted mauve Easter eggs~ 期待你的37-point style guide！📜 这节目不火都难！🔥 Catch you later, Doc！😂
[A]:  I shall expect your design proofs delivered by carrier pigeon on watered silk parchment. And do remind your... 'design team' that proper Victorian gesticulation requires at least three inches of starched cuff visible at all times. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a pressing engagement with Wordsworth's laundry receipts and a particularly temperamental bottle of 1846 iron gall ink. Toodle-pip.
[B]: Roger that！✉️ 我们会train some carrier pigeons ASAP~ 🕊️ 顺便问下，你对ink的颜色有specific Pantone要求吗？😂 我们的graphic designer可能会ask for hex code~ 期待看到Wordsworth's laundry receipts带来的inspiration！✨ 这绝对会是史上最academically rigorous的综艺节目！🎓 Toodle-loo！
[A]:  Pantone? Hex codes? Good lord, we're recreating history, not programming some infernal...  smartphone application. The ink must match precisely the oxidized hue one finds in the marginalia of Coleridge's annotated 'Lyrical Ballads' - that particular shade of sepia that whispers of opium dreams and missed publisher deadlines. Now if you'll excuse me, this conversation is causing my quill hand to develop a most unscholarly tremor. Pip pip.
[B]: Copy that！📜 我们会send our team to the British Library做color matching~ 🎨 保证还原出那种'opium dreams meets missed deadlines'的perfect sepia！😂 节目播出后，你可能会成为academia和entertainment界的legendary figure！🌟 现在我就不disturb你和Coleridge's marginalia的quality time了~ Catch you on the flip side, Your Most Pedantic Majesty！👑
