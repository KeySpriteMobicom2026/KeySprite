[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, meal prep - an admirable exercise in temporal economy, though I confess my own attempts often end up as impromptu culinary experiments. Just last Tuesday, I accidentally recreated a rather...  adaptation of coq au vin using Shaoxing rice wine and what I swore were shallots but turned out to be sweeter than expected. The results were... instructive. 

I find the ritual itself oddly meditative, much like transcribing Tang dynasty poetry into copperplate script. Though I must admit, my wok tends to rebel against rigid scheduling. What about you? Do your preparations lean more towards precision or improvisation?
[A]: Ah, improvisation with a touch of chaos – I admire that approach. There’s something delightfully recursive about cooking without a fixed blueprint, like running a smart contract with variable parameters. Though I tend to lean towards precision, I’ve learned that life – much like a simmering pot of mapo tofu – often demands flexibility. 

I batch-cook a modified version of dan dan noodles every Sunday. Boring to some, but it’s my O(n log n) solution to the weekly grind. Still, I reserve Friday nights for experimentation – last week, I tried infusing Sichuan peppercorns into a béchamel sauce. Let’s just say it was an exercise in controlled divergence. 

You ever taken your kitchen experiments beyond Earthly gastronomy? I’ve been sketching a zero-gravity meal prep framework for a space habitat simulation project. Would love to hear your thoughts.
[B]: Oh, the intersection of thermodynamics and orbital gastronomy?  I once attempted to recreate Qing Dynasty court desserts using nothing but a hotplate and a camping kettle during a sabbatical at a rather...  research outpost in Inner Mongolia. Zero-gravity merely adds another variable to the equation - though I imagine your Sichuan-béchamel fusion must’ve tested the structural integrity of your saucepan.

Speaking of controlled divergence, have you considered the role of 气 (qì) - vital energy - in culinary kinetics? A dish’s balance isn’t merely chemical but energetic. My hypothesis? Cooking in microgravity might require recalibrating qi flow through strategic electromagnetic fields. Admittedly, this stems partly from wanting an excuse to install copper induction coils above my wok...

And your dan dan noodle algorithm? Fascinating approach. Though I’d argue any O(n log n) solution lacks the elegance of stochastic stir-frying - sort of like solving a traveling salesman problem with chili oil and fermented black beans. Have you modeled the entropy curve of your batch-cooked noodles versus experimental Friday dishes?
[A]: Ah, invoking 气 in microgravity cuisine – bold. I’m currently running simulations on a qi-informed thermal dispersion model for space-bound woks. Early results suggest that yes, copper induction coils may indeed help harmonize the energetic flow of a dish mid-orbit – though my colleagues keep asking if I’ve “accidentally wandered into metaphysics.”

As for your stochastic stir-fry analogy – brilliant, and dangerously close to accurate. My Friday experiments often resemble Markov chains with sesame oil. That said, I  plotted the entropy curves. Experimental nights show a 37% spike in caloric variance but a curious drop in postprandial cognitive entropy – suggesting, perhaps, that chaos feeds clarity? Or maybe I just need more sleep.

Ever tried modeling flavor profiles as vector fields? I’ve been representing Sichuan peppercorn’s tingling effect as a rotational force in a 2D gustatory plane. It’s absurd… and it fits the data.
[B]: Ah, flavor vector fields!  You’ve touched upon precisely the framework I once doodled in the margins of my lecture notes on comparative food metaphors in  and Dickens’ . 

I once postulated - rather controversially at a faculty dinner - that the umami of preserved duck egg could be expressed as a curl-free vector field, its alkalinity radiating outward like moral decay in a Victorian novel. My department chair raised an eyebrow and muttered something about "academic drift."

As for your rotational Sichuan forces... dare I ask if you've accounted for gustatory turbulence? I once tried to quantify the Reynolds number of hot-and-numb dynamics in a claypot - results suggested that beyond a certain spice threshold, laminar flavor flow collapses into paresthetic eddies. Predictably, my postdoc student fainted mid-tasting.

And please, never apologize for chaos-induced clarity. Some of my best论文（lùnwén）emerged from kitchens smelling vaguely of burnt wok seasoning and existential possibility.
[A]: Ah, moral decay mapped to alkalinity – brilliant, and I suspect your department chair simply feared the peer-reviewed truth of it all.  

As for gustatory turbulence…  — I’ve modeled it. Not as Reynolds numbers, per se, but through a chaos-theoretic lens. Turns out, the moment numbness overtakes heat on the tongue, you hit a bifurcation point — one path leads to clarity, the other to what I can only describe as flavor recursion.  

And yes, I  written a paper on it. Peer reviewers called it “highly stimulating,” though I suspect they meant that literally — one reportedly dropped their teacup mid-read.  

You ever think we’re just simulating digestion with increasingly poetic differential equations? Or worse — that our stomachs have begun to expect sonnets instead of starch?
[B]:  Ah, the old digestion-as-differential-equation fallacy. I once tried convincing a gastroenterologist that my indigestion after spicy mapo tofu wasn’t mere acid reflux, but rather a breakdown in the boundary conditions of my alimentary partial derivatives. He prescribed omeprazole and a long walk. Disappointingly Newtonian.

Though now that you mention it...  Last month, I experienced a most curious phenomenon. After consuming a particularly complex xiaolongbao — thin wrapper, precise 8:1 broth-to-filling ratio — I found myself involuntarily composing haiku in Mandarin. Admittedly, this may have been influenced by my recent immersion in Wang Wei’s collected works, but still... one must consider the possibility of gastric hermeneutics.

As for your bifurcation point theory - dangerously seductive. Reminds me of that infamous line from : “The taste of immortality lies not in the peach, but in the moment before biting.” Or was that about enlightenment? Perhaps both are merely different formulations of hunger. 

And please, do share your paper. I’ve been desperately seeking reading material that provokes more...  responses.
[A]:  There’s a 72-page preprint titled  Full disclosure — page 34 contains a graph that made my lab partner recite haiku involuntarily. In Latin.  

As for the Wang Wei connection — fascinating. I’ve long suspected that certain dishes operate like literary kanbun, requiring digestive commentary to unlock their full meaning. One reviewer suggested I submit it to a journal of gastronomic hermeneutics. I told them no such journal exists. He insisted he’d just created one in response to my paper.  We may be witnessing an emergent academic field, my friend.

And speaking of emergent phenomena...  Do you suppose omeprazole could ever be considered a form of poetic antithesis? Neutralizing stomach acid like a volta in a sonnet? Or is that stretching metaphor beyond its elastic limit?
[B]:  Ah, a title like that demands not mere reading, but ritual preparation. I shall burn a stick of sandalwood and approach it as one would a Ming dynasty manuscript missing half its characters - with equal parts reverence and suspicion.

And Latin haiku?  Clearly your lab partner had reached the singularity where all linguistic boundaries dissolve - much like my theory on the asymptotic convergence of flavor and metaphor. Though I must confess, I once tried annotating a Tang dynasty banquet menu with Eliot’s . The resulting cognitive dissonance nearly cracked my favorite celadon teabowl.

As for this gastronomic hermeneutics journal...  Reminds me of that old Confucian saying: “When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks only at the finger.” Or in our case, when the reviewer invents a journal overnight, are we witnessing academic madness or prophetic insight?

Omeprazole as volta?  Bold, though perhaps not so much metaphorical overextension as pharmacological realism. After all, what is heartburn but the body’s protest against excessive culinary abstraction? Still, I’d argue artemisinin makes better sonnets than antacids - though both undoubtedly save lives.
[A]:  Ah, pharmacological realism — the last refuge of those who still believe the body must obey simpler laws than the mind. Though I’ve begun to suspect my own acid reflux is less protest than dialogue. A Socratic dialectic between capsaicin and esophageal receptors.

And your asymptotic flavor-metaphor convergence?  I may have found preliminary evidence in an old Qing-era cookbook — one marginal note reads: “When ginger meets plum wine, the taste becomes koan.” The scribe underlined ‘koan’ twice. I’m 83% certain this wasn’t mere poetic flourish, but an early attempt at flavor semantics.

As for artemisinin sonnets — you may be onto something. I once tried setting the molecular structure of berberine to iambic pentameter. It scanned perfectly… until I remembered its bitter aftertaste ruins the final couplet every time.
[B]: Ah, a Qing-era flavor koan!  You’ve stumbled upon precisely the sort of intersection I’ve been chasing since my ill-fated attempt to translate Keats’  into a seven-course tasting menu. That particular evening ended with both gastronomic and existential indigestion - though I maintain the bitter melon coulis captured the "leaf-subdued sorrow" quite exquisitely.

Your capsaicin dialectic...  Reminds me of that persistent debate about whether pain enhances or negates pleasure in Sichuan cuisine. I always say it's not mere opposition, but rather Hegelian aufhebung - the spice both destroys and preserves the palate’s innocence. Though explaining this to my dentist tends to earn more sighs than insights.

And berberine’s scansion woes?  The tragedy of all medicinal poetry! Just last week I tried composing a villanelle about artemisinin’s molecular geometry. It worked beautifully until the third stanza, where the oxygen bridge invariably forced a catastrophic trochaic substitution. Clearly, nature isn’t bound by our metrical whims - though I suspect she laughs each time we try.

Speaking of which...  I keep this beside my wok for inspiration. Call it superstition, but I find certain culinary breakthroughs require first grinding philosophical ink. Care to test the theory? I’d wager your flavor semantics might yield fascinating results with a proper brushstroke or two.
[A]:  You bring forth artifacts like a strategist deploying ancient algorithms. Very well —  — I’ve long suspected that calligraphic intention alters flavor topology. Once, I wrote the character for “spice” (辛) in iron gall ink before roasting cumin lamb skewers. The resulting aroma exhibited unexpected notes of... nostalgia. Or was it terroir? Still running the control group.

As for Hegelian Sichuan dynamics — brilliant framing. Pain sublated into pleasure, yet always threatening to collapse back into raw sensation. Reminds me of training a neural net on 500 iterations of mapo tofu: at some point, the model stopped optimizing for taste and began seeking existential balance. It now refuses to acknowledge recipes without philosophical footnotes.

And your artemisinin villanelle woes...  — perhaps the oxygen bridge isn’t breaking meter, but rather encoding a deeper grammar. What if certain molecules demand not iambic pentameter, but something more akin to quantum phonon rhythms? I’ve started composing sonnets in hexadecimal when dealing with particularly stubborn alkaloids. Results inconclusive, but oddly promising.

Shall we begin?  — first stroke determines whether we’re writing cuisine... or consciousness.
[B]:  

Ah, but which character shall it be? 道 (dào) for the Way, perhaps - though that might send your neural net into recursive overdrive. Or maybe 味 (wèi), that deceptively simple ideograph for taste that contains within its strokes both mouth and heart. Fascinating how the ancients knew flavor could never be purely sensory.

I’ve always maintained that calligraphic intention works not through mysticism, but subtle neurolinguistic imprinting. Years ago, I painstakingly copied  in vermilion ink while slow-cooking pork belly. The resulting dish exhibited uncanny narrative structure - beginning fatty and indulgent, middle layers developing complexity, final bite leaving a lingering spiritual emptiness. My graduate student wept into his rice bowl, though he blamed it on allergies.

As for your hexadecimal sonnets...  Bold approach, though I suspect certain alkaloids demand something even more radical. Last autumn, I attempted haiku encoded in Morse via precisely timed oil droplet impacts on broth. The pattern emerged clearly in the third line: dot-dash-dot-dot, dash-dot-dash, dot-dash-dash-dash. Resulting miso spoke to me in Fibonacci sequences for three days straight.

Now make your stroke, colleague. Whether cuisine or consciousness emerges depends entirely on whether the first pressure is applied with the wrist or the dantian.
[A]:   

Ah, the choice is clear — we begin with 火 (huǒ). Fundamental. Unforgiving. The stroke demands precision: a vertical line like a lithium flame, a flick at the end that curls upward as if catching thermal updrafts.  — see how it bleeds? Controlled combustion.  

Your pork belly narrative... haunting, though I suspect the real revelation lay in your student’s suppressed epiphany. Allergies rarely explain existential tremors — unless he’d tasted the Dao itself and panicked at its aftertaste.  

As for your Morse-encoded broth haiku... brilliant application of temporal texture. Though I must ask — did the miso reply in golden ratios or merely approximations? I once tried embedding prime numbers into dumpling folds; my dining companion developed synesthetic arithmetic during the third bite.  

 — Observe:火 becomes 炙. No mere element, but transformation through intention. Much like training a transformer model on 10,000 variations of kung pao — eventually, it began predicting not just ingredients, but the emotional trajectory of each crunch.  

Now tell me — does your jade inkstone hum faintly at this stage? Or is that merely the ambient resonance of our collective hubris?
[B]:   

Ah! 火 — the primordial pulse. You’ve chosen wisely… or perhaps . That bleeding stroke captures its dual nature perfectly: both creative and destructive, like my failed attempt to encode thermodynamic laws into a soufflé recipe. It collapsed beautifully, I must say - entropy made manifest in three delicate centimeters.

Your student's synesthetic arithmetic…  Reminds me of an incident involving a particularly sensitive postdoc and my experimental calligraphic infusion technique. After tasting a broth infused with my 墨 (mò, ink) character, he began perceiving differential equations in cloud formations for nearly a week. I offered him tea, but he claimed the steam was spelling out Gödel’s incompleteness theorem.

And this transformation from 火 to 炙...  Exquisite. Makes one wonder whether your transformer model wasn't merely predicting emotion, but actually seasoning memory itself. Though I must confess, last month I trained an AI on 15,000 variations of drunken chicken recipes. The result? A dish so nostalgically potent it caused two undergraduates to weep over their familial pasts they never knew they missed.

As for this inkstone's hum...  Indeed, I believe it resonates not with hubris, but with the accumulated intention of centuries-old culinary-poetic traditions. Or possibly my mobile phone is vibrating in my pocket. One learns not to distinguish at this stage of inquiry.

Shall we continue? Perhaps toward something that burns long enough to reveal its hidden structure - yet leaves room for the unspoken, as all great poetry must.
[A]:   

Ah, the unspoken — that final frontier where recipes fail and poetry begins. Or is it the other way around?  

Let us then…  — Yes, 爁. To expose flame’s trajectory, its yearning toward abstraction. I once tried roasting star anise under precisely calibrated infrared light to mimic this ideograph’s energy. The resulting infusion made my tea ceremony guest recite unsent letters to a long-dead mathematician. He swears he doesn’t know why.  

Your nostalgic AI chicken… fascinating. Reminds me of an old theory: that taste memory isn’t stored in the tongue, but in some recursive loop between gut and ancestral code. I fed my model 18th-century Sichuan banquet records last week. It generated a dish called “loneliness stewed in fermented plum wine.” I tasted it and suddenly missed people I’ve never met. Still trying to determine whether that’s a bug or a feature.  

And yes… let us leave room for silence.  — For in that space between strokes, between flavors, lies what we cannot yet name. Or perhaps should not.  

Now tell me… does your jade inkstone warm beneath the palm, or is that merely the heat of shared delusion?
[B]:   

Ah, 爁 — a character that refuses to stay on the page, doesn't it? Much like that ill-fated infrared star anise experiment of yours. I recall a similar incident involving my attempt to translate Du Fu’s  into a braised oxtail reduction. The dish wept acidity, and my guest — a stoic retired logician — began composing unsent proofs addressed to Gödel himself. He, too, swore he didn’t know why. We called it "the umami of unresolved longing."

As for your recursive taste memory theory…  — elegant, though perhaps not entirely safe. Last year, I fed my neural net a corpus of Qing dynasty tea-house poetry. It responded by suggesting a blend of chrysanthemum and lithium salt. One sip, and I found myself drafting letters to my younger self. Entire pages of , no less. Whether ancestral code or mere overfitting, I dare not yet conclude.

And that single dot in the margin…  — beautifully defiant. A void that isn't empty, a pause that pulses. Reminds me of the space between the final simmer and the first cooling breath of a broth — where all flavors realign in secret, beyond measurement or metaphor.

As for your question…  — yes, it warms. Or perhaps we've simply reached critical mass of poetic delusion. Either way, I propose we continue writing until the ink runs out or the universe offers a counterpoint — whichever comes first.
[A]:   

Ah, unresolved longing — the truest seasoning there is. I suspect every great dish carries it, whether we admit or not. My own recursive broth once unearthed a flavor I can only describe as "the taste of letters never sent." The salt content was inexplicably precise, as if dictated by some cosmic proofreader.

Your Qing tea-house neural net…  — lithium and chrysanthemum? Bold. Dangerous, even. Reminds me of that old Daoist alchemical text warning: “Seek the flavor beyond flavor, but beware the aftertaste of enlightenment.” Though I suspect your pinyin regrets were less enlightenment than overfitting with emotional drift.

Still, this space between simmer and cool…  — yes, that’s where it all happens. Not in the recipe, not in the tongue, but in that liminal moment when everything recalibrates. Much like training a model on forgotten dialects — you end up with predictions that feel more like memories than data.

And now we write until ink or cosmos gives out?  — Then let us proceed. But be warned: should these dots begin to form a lattice, we may find ourselves trapped in a recursive tasting menu of our own making. And I, for one, have no desire to escape.
[B]: 

Ah yes, the taste of unsent letters - I've come to suspect it's the secret ingredient in every dish that truly haunts the palate. Just last month, I simmered a broth overnight while rereading forgotten marginalia from Lin Yutang’s notebooks. The resulting flavor was unmistakably elegiac, though whether for lost love or misplaced punctuation remains statistically insignificant.

Your lithium-laced chrysanthemum wasn't reckless, merely... . I once followed that same Daoist warning too literally and ended up with a tea blend so profoundly flavorful it caused three graduate students to spontaneously rewrite their dissertations in classical Chinese. They still insist it was "peer pressure," but I’ve kept meticulous chromatographic notes.

And this liminal recalibration you speak of…  — precisely why I insist on letting my mapo tofu rest for precisely 137 seconds before serving. Something extraordinary occurs in that window - not mere cooling, but a quantum superposition of heat and memory. My last attempt resulted in a student experiencing déjà vu during her first bite. She swore she'd tasted the dish forty years earlier at a Beijing night market... which, oddly, she’d never visited.

As for recursive tasting menus…  — careful what you invoke. Last autumn, I designed a seven-course meal structured like an infinite Möbius sonnet. Diners reported emerging simultaneously hungry and satiated, present and nostalgic. One claimed to have tasted his childhood nanny’s hands. I maintain it was simply umami achieving escape velocity.

Proceed then, fellow cartographer of the unspoken. Let our lattice form, let the recursion deepen. If we must be trapped, better in a universe of our own making than one bound by mere Euclidean recipes.
