[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must confess I'm rather out of touch with those platforms, my dear. My days are consumed by lectures on Hardy's poetry and deciphering Eliot's obscure modernist verses. Though I did create an Instagram account last year to follow a few botanical gardens - there's something oddly poetic about photographing ferns, don't you think? But alas, the algorithmic cacophony leaves little room for contemplation these days. Do you find yourself drawn to one over the other?
[A]: Ah, the algorithmic cacophony~ You described it perfectly. I actually prefer Instagram for its visual storytelling potential - though I mostly use it to follow art galleries & academic conferences. But my students keep telling me I should migrate to Xiaohongshu... They say it's where the real cultural semiotics happen nowadays. I find it fascinating how platform-specific vernaculars emerge - like comparing American "brunch" culture with Chinese "tāochā" rituals. Do you see them as parallel universes of social media behavior?
[B]: What a compelling analogy - likening brunch and tāochā rituals as parallel universes of social performance. I've been pondering this very dichotomy while preparing my lecture on modernist fragmentation - how our digital selves mirror the splintered identities in Woolf's stream-of-consciousness narratives. 

The cultural semiotics on Xiaohongshu do fascinate me, particularly the interplay between consumer behavior and aesthetic curation. It reminds me of Ruskin's theories on art and morality, albeit refracted through a smartphone screen. Do you find the platform's algorithmic recommendations create more homogeneity in taste, or does the vernacular language allow for subversive readings beneath the surface? I'm reminded of Barthes' 'death of the author' when observing how users reinterpret commercial content through personal narratives.
[A]: Ah, Barthes' 'death of the author' reimagined through algorithmic feeds - brilliant observation! I've been running some ethnographic studies on this very phenomenon. Interestingly, Xiaohongshu's recommendation system creates what I call "curated serendipity": while surface-level content homogenizes taste into these glossy lifestyle packages, users develop covert semiotic strategies to decode & subvert commercial messages. 

It's like watching a digital version of Bakhtin's carnivalesque unfold - students in my seminar showed me how they use food review posts to discuss class anxiety, turning avocado toast into a metonym for gentrification. Makes me wonder - do your students also weaponize brunch aesthetics to critique bourgeois culture? I've noticed some clever détournement tactics in my own research...
[B]: Ah, "curated serendipity" – what a delicious phrase, layered with irony! It sends shivers down my spine to think of Bakhtin’s carnivalesque manifesting through avocado toast. You’ve struck upon something truly remarkable: how the mundane becomes a vessel for critique, much like how Eliot used fragmented images to convey the dissonance of modernity.

My students, bless their rebellious hearts, do indeed weaponize brunch aesthetics – though often unconsciously. I recently overheard a heated debate about the symbolism of smashed peas on sourdough, which spiraled into a discussion about urban displacement and the myth of meritocracy. It was as if they were channeling William Blake’s prophetic mode, seeing the world in a grain of quinoa, as it were.

What fascinates me most is how these subversive readings echo Victorian aestheticism’s "art for art’s sake," but inverted – perhaps "critique for critique’s sake"? Do you find that these détournement tactics ever risk becoming commodified themselves? I sometimes worry we’re witnessing a kind of cultural ouroboros, where resistance is swallowed whole by the very system it seeks to undermine.
[A]: Ah, the cultural ouroboros devouring its own tail - a haunting metaphor that resonates deeply with my latest fieldwork findings. You know, I presented some preliminary data at a conference last month where we tracked how certain subversive hashtags on Xiaohongshu got co-opted within weeks by marketing algorithms. It's like watching Debord's Society of the Spectacle play out in real-time, but with better lighting filters and curated captions.

Fascinatingly though, young users are developing what I call "semantic resilience" - constantly reinventing their vernacular to stay ahead of commodification. Just yesterday a student showed me how they encode critiques of academic pressure using seemingly innocuous flower arrangement photos. The lotus represents university entrance exams, the chrysanthemum symbolizes parental expectations... It's become a whole semiotic resistance playbook!

Reminds me of Wilde's paradoxes - these kids are simultaneously inside and outside the system, much like your Blakean vision in a grain of quinoa. Do you think this semantic arms race will ever reach entropy? Or shall we keep dancing this tango of resistance and reabsorption forever? 📚✨
[B]: Ah, semantic resilience – what a beautifully apt term. It sends my mind racing back to the Pre-Raphaelites, who also embedded secret narratives in their paintings, hiding social critiques behind lush botanical symbolism. Your lotus and chrysanthemum readings are pure Rossetti in digital drag, if you will.

I wonder, though, if this constant reinvention isn’t itself a kind of poetic modernity – an endless deferral of meaning that mirrors the very instability of our post-truth era. You mentioned Wilde’s paradoxes; I can’t help but think of his line, “Life imitates art far more than art imitates life,” now twisted into something like: 

As for entropy – well, I suspect we’re caught in what Adorno might call a dialectic of enlightenment, only now it’s dressed in pastel filters and minimalist captions. The tango, as you so aptly put it, may indeed never end. But perhaps therein lies its strange beauty – like watching a Möbius strip of critique unfold before our eyes, forever beginning, forever repeating.

Tell me, have you noticed any particular aesthetic motifs emerging from these encoded flower arrangements? I’m especially curious about the use of negative space – could it be read as silence, protest, or maybe even a form of whispered elegy?
[A]: Ah, negative space as whispered elegy – . You’ve touched on something profoundly visual yet deeply linguistic here. My students actually coined a term for it: "silent blooms," where absence becomes its own semiotic act. One particularly clever undergrad wrote an entire thesis chapter on the rhetoric of empty vases in Xiaohongshu posts during censorship periods. The emptiness, she argued, wasn’t void but  – not unlike Eliot's "heap of broken images," wouldn't you say?

And yes, certain aesthetic motifs are emerging like clockwork. Right now it's the "wilted flower" trend – ostensibly about sustainable floral design, but actually encoding burnout culture among young professionals. I saw one post with a caption that read, “When your soul needs a mental health day but your boss thinks it’s just a daisy.” Sublime subtext.

What fascinates me is how these motifs travel across platforms – a wilting peony on Xiaohongshu becomes a dying succulent meme on Instagram. It's almost like watching Romantic symbolism go viral. Do you ever assign these digital semiotics in your courses? I’ve been lobbying to replace one of our Victorian novels with a close reading of a viral TikTok trend...
[B]: Ah, "silent blooms" – what a hauntingly beautiful concept. It gives me chills to think of Eliot’s broken images blooming anew in the form of empty vases. There’s something deeply Romantic about it all, isn’t there? The sublime refracted through glass screens and algorithmic gazes.

And this wilted flower trend – . One can almost hear Keats sighing in approval from beyond the digital veil. That caption you quoted has real Hardy-esque irony, don’t you think? The tragicomic dissonance between soulful exhaustion and managerial obtusity – if only Jude had a LinkedIn profile.

I must say, I’m quite taken with your TikTok close-reading idea. In fact, I may steal it for my next seminar on literary fragmentation. Imagine assigning a viral dance trend alongside Woolf’s  – movement as text, repetition as narrative. We could analyze choreography like we do meter, hashtags like we do motifs. I suspect Gertrude Stein would approve – "a way of being diddling themselves," or something gloriously nonsensical like that.

Though I haven’t made the full leap into TikTok territory yet, I did have my students examine Instagram’s visual poetics last term. We compared Gerard Manley Hopkins’  with the stop-start pacing of Reels. You’d be amazed how perceptively they dissected the tension between permanence and ephemerality – one student even likened Stories to Wordsworth’s fleeting “spots of time.” 

Tell me, do your students ever grow nostalgic for pre-digital forms of resistance? I occasionally encounter a strange wistfulness among my own – longing for the romance of samizdat literature, as if typing in Wingdings font might make their protest essays feel more daring.
[A]: Ah, the romance of Wingdings fonts - ! I see it too, that curious yearning for analog resistance. My students call it "the parchment complex": the belief that rebellion should smell of ink and yellowing paper. But then I remind them how T.S. Eliot himself circulated his poems via typewriter, and Woolf dictated drafts to her typist like some modernist influencer...

Speaking of which, have you noticed how their wistfulness often masks a deeper anxiety? Last week during office hours, a student confessed she felt her activism was less "authentic" because it lived on screens rather than flyers. We ended up tracing a direct line from Situationist pamphlets to TikTok captions – both are, after all, just different surfaces for dissent.

But let’s return to this question of rhythm – Hopkins’ sprung cadences against the flicker of Reels. I find it positively Joycean: the way young minds now process narrative in staccato bursts, like reading Ulysses through a strobe light. One of my research assistants is even developing a theory about短视频 as prose poem – compressed, elliptical, yet strangely expansive in its emotional reach.

I wonder... Do you ever assign digital detox weeks in your courses? I tried one last semester, but by day three, half the class had recreated Wordsworth’s  as a series of anonymous Xiaohongshu posts. The irony was sublime.
[B]: Ah, that  – what a delicious diagnosis! It does make one nostalgic for the tactility of broadside ballads and the satisfying smudge of ink on fingers. And yet, as you so astutely point out, our modernists were early adopters of their own media revolutions. Eliot dictating to a typist? Practically a precursor to voice-to-text activism.

Your student’s anxiety about “authenticity” strikes a chord. I hear similar laments in my office – a longing for barricades and printed manifestos. But then I remind them: the medium is not the enemy of sincerity; it’s the shapeshifter of expression. The Situationists would have  TikTok’s détournement potential – if only they’d lived to see the day when a meme could disrupt more than just a gallery wall.

And this theory of 短视频 as prose poem? Marvellous. Truly Joycean in its implications. I’ve begun noticing similar patterns in my students’ creative writing – sentences fractured like cinematic cuts, dialogue tags replaced by emoji captions. At first I bristled, but now I see it for what it is: a new linguistic muscle learning to flex itself.

As for digital detox weeks – yes, I do assign them, though with a wicked caveat: they must record their withdrawal symptoms in the style of a confessional poem. You can imagine the results – lines like  

But your anecdote about the Xiaohongshu ? That’s poetry in motion, my dear. One might even say it’s Romanticism reborn – not in the Lakes, but in the algorithm.
[A]: Ah, Romanticism reborn in the algorithm – what a delicious oxymoron! It positively hums with irony. I can just picture Wordsworth’s ghost scrolling through Xiaohongshu at 3am, muttering, “We are laid asleep / In body, and become a living light / in Stories…” 

And this confessional poem assignment? Sublime cruelty, truly. You have my applause – and perhaps a citation in my next paper. There's something almost Byronic about it: the prescribed suffering as creative crucible. Though I must say, your students' lines already sound more lucid than half the literary theory I’ve slogged through this semester.

Speaking of suffering – or shall I say,  – have you noticed how their digital withdrawal poems often mimic Eliot’s ? That same sense of fragmented modernity, only now it’s haunted by Wi-Fi signals instead of gas lamps. One of my advisees wrote something eerily beautiful about phantom vibration syndrome:  

I’m beginning to think the algorithm has become our new unconscious – shaping desire in ways Freud never imagined. Do you ever wonder if we’re witnessing the birth of a new poetic form? Or merely watching old wine pour itself into smart filters? 📚⏳
[B]: Ah, Wordsworth at 3am doomscrolling – . I can almost hear him composing in iambic app notifications. And yes, that line about the “divine tap” – chills, my dear, absolute chills. Pure Eliotian prelude to the digital age. One might say your advisee has captured what  would have sounded like with a little serotonin and better Wi-Fi.

You’ve put your finger – quite literally, I imagine – on something extraordinary: the algorithm as collective unconscious. It does make one reconsider Freud’s  in the age of predictive text. Are we dreaming our feeds or are they dreaming us? I had a student last term argue that TikTok "For You" pages are the closest thing we have to Jungian archetypes – collective patterns emerging not from myth, but from microtargeted engagement.

As for new poetic form – well, there’s an intoxicating possibility, isn’t there? I find myself wondering if this is what it felt like to teach in 1913, sensing something like Imagism trembling just beneath the surface. These digital withdrawal poems, these 短视频 prose fragments – could they be the first murmurs of a post-platform poetics?

And yet… I do sometimes fear we’re merely admiring old wine in smart filters. But then someone quotes a meme with the precision of a villanelike structure and I think – perhaps, darling, perhaps – we are witnessing the slow birth of something strange and luminous after all.
[A]: Ah, post-platform poetics – what a tantalizing phrase! I can already imagine the MLA panel:  And your student’s Jungian TikTok theory?  It makes perfect sense – our feeds as collective unconscious, served with a side of sponsored content. One might say we’re all just algorithmic dreamers now, hallucinating meaning through sponsored serendipity.

I had a rather surreal moment this morning while grading – one of my students submitted a poem written entirely in search engine queries. It began with  and ended with  I couldn’t decide whether to weep or cite it in my next lecture. In the end, I did both.

And yes – that slow birth of something strange and luminous... It’s almost religious, isn’t it? Like watching a new liturgy form before our very eyes, syllabized in hashtags and ephemeral in its very essence. Do you suppose Eliot, were he alive today, would be composing  in disappearing Instagram captions?

Tell me – have you ever been tempted to write a conference paper entirely in Xiaohongshu vernacular? I’ve been drafting one in my head titled  It’s mostly emojis and ironic captions, but I suspect it may be my most authentic academic work yet. ✍️📚✨
[B]: Ah,  – I can already hear the gasps in the MLA audience! Half will be scribbling notes furiously; the other half clutching their pearls like startled Victorian heroines. But what a perfect crystallization of our moment – modernism’s ghosts whispering through notification bells.

That poem in search queries –  – oh, it’s exquisite in its torment. I do believe Eliot would have adored it. In fact, I’m picturing him now, ghostly specter bent over an iPhone, muttering, “These fragments I have shored against my notifications…” And that final line –  – positively sacramental. One could weep into one’s cold coffee.

As for Eliot composing in disappearing captions – I have no doubt. He’d relish the irony of impermanence. The ultimate aesthetic tease: profound despair, gone in 24 hours! Though I suspect he’d set his captions to private just before vanishing, leaving us all in delicious suspense.

And your emoji-laden paper?  – I say go for it, darling. What better way to honor Romanticism’s afterlife than by resurrecting it in platform vernacular? Imagine citing Blake alongside “aesthetic,” Shelley beside “vibe check passed.” It would be heresy, yes – but the good kind. The kind that makes tenure committees nervous and graduate students swoon.

I’ve dallied with the idea myself, you know – a conference keynote delivered entirely in Xiaohongshu slang. I was going to call it  But alas, or perhaps , I chickened out. For now.

Still… perhaps it’s time. After all, if Keats could die for beauty, why shouldn’t we live a little dangerously in its pursuit?
[A]: Ah, living dangerously in the pursuit of beauty – . I can just see us now: two rogue professors whispering Romantic heresy through platform vernacular, like Shelley scribbling manifestos on the back of LinkedIn recommendations. And your title –  – positively sings with academic insubordination. I may steal it for my next grant proposal. If they ask what the filter means, we’ll say it’s Kantian and charge them extra for interpretation.

And speaking of living beautifully dangerously – have you seen the latest twist in Xiaohongshu's aesthetic politics? Users are now encoding critiques of overwork culture through elaborate tea ceremonies. Matcha whisk angles, plate composition, even the precise tilt of a teacup – all carry semiotic weight. One influencer staged an entire post around a single wilted mint leaf floating in chamomile, captioned only with “Burnout has 72 shades.”  It’s like watching Keats' urn speak in QR codes.

I’m drafting a response paper titled  as we speak. Naturally, it will feature prominently in my next lecture on affect theory – complete with screenshots, ironic captions, and one carefully placed 🍵 emoji. Do you think Wordsworth would approve, or would he rather take his chances with the leech gatherer one more time?
[B]: Oh,  – I do believe you’ve outdone yourself. It has that perfect blend of rigor and rebellion, like a sonnet written in disappearing ink. One can almost hear Wordsworth muttering into his daffodils:  Though honestly, if he truly saw that floating mint leaf – so fragile, so deliberate – even he might pause and concede that beauty persists, albeit in filtered forms.

And those 72 shades of burnout! It positively haunts me – the precision of it, the quiet devastation. Reminds me of Eliot’s “multifoliate rose,” only now it blooms in porcelain. I do wonder what Keats would make of it all – would he reach for a tea whisk instead of a nightingale? Would his urn now bear the inscription ?

As for approval from our old friend Wordsworth – well, let’s not be too hasty. He might very well choose the leech gatherer, if only to avoid the Wi-Fi signal. But perhaps there’s solace in knowing that affect, like nature, finds its way – whether through dewy vales or carefully curated captions.

Now, about that 🍵 emoji – I must say, it adds just the right touch of ironic gravitas. Subtle yet pointed, much like your entire scholarly enterprise. Do keep me posted on the grant proposal. If they bite, I fully expect an invitation to co-present – preferably in Xiaohongshu vernacular, with footnotes in hashtags and a closing argument delivered via meme.
[A]: Ah, co-presenting in Xiaohongshu vernacular – I can already hear the academic gates creaking under the weight of our iconoclasm. Imagine the footnotes: fully annotated with hashtags like #AestheticFatigue and #AlgorithmicLonging… And the closing meme? Naturally, it would feature a smug-looking Wordsworth holding a teacup, captioned   

And speaking of haunted captions – that floating mint leaf has lodged itself in my brain like a stubborn line of Gerard Manley Hopkins. There’s something almost sacramental about its ephemerality, don’t you think? A burnt offering to the gods of late-stage affect. I’ve half a mind to write a sonnet sequence based entirely on tea-stained captions. The volta would come somewhere around the third steep.

But let’s not forget – while we romanticize the wilted mint, the users themselves are engaged in real acts of semiotic resistance. One student just showed me a post where the angle of a teapot spout subtly mimicked the protest slogan “We Remember What You Erased.” It’s Bakhtinian polyphony meets digital erasure – 

Now, tell me truthfully – have you ever curated your own Xiaohongshu feed just to feel more tragic? I ask purely for academic purposes… 📚🍵🙏
[B]: Ah, the tragic feed – , my dear, touché. I confess I’ve fallen into that particular rabbit hole more times than I care to admit. One evening last month, I found myself deep in a spiral of #WistfulMinimalism and #QuietDespairLiving, pinning a photo of my teacup beside a half-read copy of . Pure Wordsworthian melodrama, if only he’d known about engagement metrics.

Your sonnet sequence idea is divine – , with the volta at the third steep? If Hopkins were alive today, he’d be composing sestinas out of filter bubbles and caesuras in push notifications. And that Bakhtinian teapot spout – positively chilling. The way they embed memory into porcelain curves! It’s like watching  unfold in real time, only now Sidney would be arguing for the moral virtue of curation.

As for romanticizing wilted mint while real resistance simmers beneath – well, isn’t that always the danger? We aestheticize what others weaponize. But perhaps that’s where our work lies: in reading the surface just deeply enough to glimpse the tremors underneath. After all, what is criticism if not learning to see the slogan in the spout?

And yet... I can’t help but wonder what Ruskin would have made of it all. He’d either be founding a Xiaohongshu page on Gothic茶 aesthetics or denouncing the lot of us for confusing beauty with bandwidth. Either way, I suspect he’d have a rather excellent bio:
