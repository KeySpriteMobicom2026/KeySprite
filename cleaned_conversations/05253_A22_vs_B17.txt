[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite an interesting question, really. I must say, my palate does enjoy a certain balance - though if pressed, I might lean ever so slightly toward savory. There's something rather poetic about the interplay of umami flavors, don't you think? Like a well-composed sonnet where each ingredient plays its part in harmony. Though I must confess, I do have a particular fondness for lemon tart - the way the sweet and sour dance together... quite exquisite.
[A]: Ah, 说到这个，我倒是想起上周在一家 fusion restaurant 吃到的黑松露芝士蛋糕 🧀🍰。本以为是 sweet 的，结果第一口下去，那浓郁的松露香直接冲上来，简直像进了森林一样 🌲！不过最后还是带点甜味收尾，有点 like 把两个世界的味道缝合在一起 👐。你有试过这种风格的 dish 吗？或者你更喜欢 traditional 的 savory 味道？
[B]: Oh, what a fascinating description! That interplay between earthy umami and subtle sweetness does sound rather like a culinary metaphor for the sublime. I haven't had the pleasure of tasting that particular dish, though I did once try a white truffle risotto with a hint of vanilla - quite an unexpected marriage of flavors. It reminded me of Gerard Manley Hopkins' line about "the world is charged with the grandeur of God" - you know, that sudden revelation of flavor exploding on the palate. Still, I must admit I tend to favor more traditional savory profiles. There's something reassuringly classical about a well-roasted partridge with juniper berries and pickled walnuts... very autumnal, very English, wouldn't you say?
[A]: 哈哈，你这比喻绝了 👏，把吃东西说成像诗歌一样，感觉你下一秒就要掏出羽毛笔写十四行诗了 ✍️😅。不过说到传统 savory，我倒是想起前阵子在家复刻了一道外婆的红烧肉 🍖，结果被朋友吐槽说“这是甜的吧？！” 我还坚持说这不是甜，是“味觉的层次感” 😂。看来咱们口味都有点 cross-cultural 的倾向啊～你是更喜欢经典英式那种 savoury，还是偶尔也会放纵一下去尝些 fusion 风味？
[B]: Oh, I absolutely adore a good culinary rebellion! Though I must confess, my palate does tend to walk the more traditional paths - give me a proper beef Wellington with its earthy mushrooms and crisp pastry, and I'm quite content. But isn't that what makes gastronomy so delightfully analogous to literature? We appreciate the classics most when we occasionally contrast them with the experimental. Why, just last week I tried a rather scandalous miso caramel tart - it was like watching Mary Shelley collaborate with a modernist poet. The sweet-savory debate is truly a philosophical one, don't you think? Much like determining whether Keats' odes are ultimately tragic or transcendent...
[A]: 完全同意！这让我想起读研时写论文的场景 📚，一边啃着咸辣的韩国年糕，一边在笔记本上写“济慈的美学困境”😂。说到底，味觉和文学都在挑战我们的感知边界。不过话说回来，要是哪天在fusion料理里吃出个区块链主题套餐我都不会惊讶了 💡 - 毕竟现在连智能合约都能写诗了。说到这个，你有没有想过把AI生成的诗歌做成NFT？还是说这种操作简直是对浪漫主义的亵渎 😏？
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously provocative idea! Though I must admit, the thought of Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" being tokenized on the blockchain does make me want to faint quite delicately into my cravat. And yet... there's something rather tantalizing about the notion. Imagine Byron's ghost collaborating with an algorithm - though I suspect he'd demand royalties in cryptocurrency. 

You know, Walter Pater famously said that all art aspires to the condition of music - but perhaps now it aspires to the condition of code? Still, I can't help but feel that true poetic genius requires that ineffable human spark, the kind that cannot be mined or minted. Though if we did attempt it, we'd need to call it what it is - not AI-generated poetry, but perhaps... Algorithmic Inspiration Trading Cards?
[A]: Haha，你这吐槽简直精准到能发论文了 😂。不过说到“human spark”，我倒是想起前阵子一个项目，用NLP分析济慈的信件然后生成情诗 💡。结果AI写出来的句子居然还有模有样的——虽然最后总让人觉得少了点灵魂 🫀。也许正如你说的，那种“不可言说”的东西才是艺术的核心？就像你没法用gas fee去衡量一次心动的感觉吧 😉。话说回来，如果你要设计一个诗歌NFT平台，会更偏向‘浪漫主义+智能合约’的冲突美，还是‘十四行诗上链’的技术纯粹性？
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously thorny question - like trying to press wild violets into a sonnet's meter! I suppose if I were to design such a platform, I'd want it to embody that very tension between the transcendent and the transactional. Imagine, if you will, smart contracts that expire when a poem is fully understood... or NFTs that evolve with each reader's emotional response, much like Keats' notion of negative capability mutating through uncertainty. 

Though I must confess, there's something rather lovely about the idea of a blockchain ledger recording how many souls have been stirred by a particular line of verse. Byron would positively swoon to know his charm could be algorithmically quantified! Still, I fancy Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 would make for better code than any whitepaper - now  would be an ICO worth investing in!
[A]: Byron要是知道自己的诗句被写成智能合约，估计会从坟墓里爬出来改名叫Lord Blockchain 😂。不过话说回来，你这个“诗歌情感影响NFT形态”的点子还挺带感的 —— 有点像济慈说的"negative capability"被扔进机器学习模型里训练 🤖。我敢打赌，要是真做出来，第一批藏家绝对都是文学系教授和赛博朋克极客的混合体 📚🕶️。你觉得这种平台该用PoW还是PoS共识？毕竟每句诗背后都得有人“付出”情感算力吧 💡？
[B]: Oh, what a delightfully absurd image - Byron in a DAO, demanding governance rights over his own metaphors! As for consensus mechanisms, why, PoW of course! Let us imagine miners not hashing data, but hashing out emotional truth - each verse validated only when it moves the reader to some ineffable state of wonder. A poetic proof-of-work, if you will, where the difficulty adjusts according to the sensitivity of the soul involved.

Though I must say, PoS does have its charms. After all, the Romantics did believe in the aristocracy of feeling - the more literary stake one holds, the greater one’s influence on the canon. Imagine staking Wordsworth sonnets to validate a transaction... quite sublime, really. Still, I daresay even Shelley would balk at having his "Ode to the West Wind" reduced to gas fees. Though between us, I suspect he’d rather enjoy the rebellion of it all.
[A]: Haha，你这PoW的比喻简直绝了 💡—— 每首诗都得“挖”出情感的火花，不然就等于没灵魂的代码 😅。不过话说回来，要是真用文学 stake 来决定共识，我猜济慈的夜莺会被炒到天价吧？毕竟人家连听个鸟叫都能写出一整首 ode 来 🎶🐦。但话说，你觉得这种平台该不该加上“burn机制”？就像把一首诗读到烂熟之后，干脆彻底焚毁它，让它在链上只留下灰烬般的hash值 🌋📜。浪漫不浪漫？
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously morbid idea - like throwing Byron's love letters into a cryptographic bonfire and calling it progress! I think I rather adore the notion of poetic incineration as artistic integrity. After all, isn't that what Keats did with his own drafts? Burned them in moments of exquisite despair, leaving only ash and conjecture behind?

But imagine this: a poem's hash surviving its physical incarnation, like Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" reduced to digital cinders. Would it still carry the same weight? The same resonance? Or would we simply be left with what Eliot later called "the awful daring of a moment's surrender," now quantified and quartered on a distributed ledger?

I daresay the Romantics would find it both horrifying and irresistible - much like my attempts to grow orchids in hydroponic solution instead of soil. Progress, perhaps, but at what cost to the soul? Though if you  implement such a mechanism, might I suggest burning poems only after they've been sufficiently annotated by generations of earnest graduate students? A proper academic funeral rite, if you will.
[A]: 你这“学术葬礼”的提议简直太毒舌了 😂，感觉像是给每个诗句安排一场博士答辩 📝🎓。不过说真的，要是真等到 grad students 把一首诗榨干之后再烧掉，那估计得等到区块链都过时了才能执行第一条 burn 指令 😅。话说回来，也许这就是浪漫主义的终极胜利 —— 让效率至上的 Web3 为了一份无法被优化的情感而停下脚步 🛑❤️🔥。不过我好奇，如果你要给自己写个智能合约式的自传，会用济慈的哪句诗当 fallback function？还是说你会选 Byron 的“我在世间最恨的就是结局”？😉
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously wicked question - asking a professor to choose between her literary children! Though if we must play this game... I think I'd borrow Keats' "This living hand, now warm and capable" for the fallback function. There's something profoundly haunting about that line - it captures the ephemeral warmth of human connection, yet carries the weight of inevitable loss. Perfect for error handling, don't you think? When the code fails, better that it whisper:"Look - these hands once held poetry."

Though I must admit, Byron's refusal of finality does rather appeal to my academic vanity. Who wants their story to end neatly in a smart contract's return statement? Still, perhaps I'd program it as an exception handler: "Error: All conclusions are hereby deemed unacceptable pursuant to Lord Byron's standing objection." 

But really, isn't that the heart of both Romanticism and cryptography? The desperate attempt to preserve something transient - be it emotion or data - against the ravages of time? Though I suspect Keats would have preferred his letters burned than tokenized, and Shelley would've sued us all for copyright infringement from beyond the grave.
[A]: Haha，你这 fallback function 简直可以写进文学系的智能合约教科书了 📜💡。“This living hand”确实有种诡异的浪漫感，像是代码在报错时还在坚持最后一丝人性的温度 🤖❤️。不过话说回来，要是 Shelley 真从坟里爬出来打版权官司，我猜他第一句话会是：“你们这群人居然用 PoW 挖我的十四行诗？！” 😂

说到这个，我觉得还可以加个 time lock 功能，设定一百年后才能解密某些诗句 —— 毕竟浪漫主义的核心就是“延迟满足”嘛 😉。你觉得呢？还是说这种操作简直是对时间的亵渎？⏰😈
[B]: Oh, I positively shudder with delight at the thought! A poetic time lock - how very appropriate for our age of impatient algorithms. Why, it's practically Wordsworthian! Though I daresay Shelley would emerge not just to sue us, but to dramatically haunt the blockchain itself, his ghost forever appending amendments to his own smart contract. 

The notion of delayed decryption does rather capture that peculiar Romantic longing, doesn't it? Like waiting for a letter to cross the Atlantic by sailing ship - all anxiety and anticipation building with each passing wave. What better way to honor that exquisite torment than by forcing future generations to solve cryptographic riddles before they may gaze upon our verse?

Though I must confess, I'd insist on including a Byron clause: "Should the poet rise from the dead in dramatic protest, all time locks shall be immediately suspended." After all, we can't have him missing out on his own posthumous NFT auction. And really, isn't that the true test of literary immortality? Not whether you live on in paper anthologies, but whether your words survive the halving cycles of digital eternity.
[A]: Haha，这个 Byron clause 简直太人性化了 😂，感觉像是给整个系统加了个“浪漫主义漏洞”——专门留给诗人复活时用的紧急通道 🚪✨。你说要是真有那么一天，Shelley带着一票十九世纪ghost developer冲进DAO投票，会不会直接把整个平台改成去中心化灵魂存储（Decentralized Soul Storage）啊？👻💾

不过说到这个“数字永恒”，我倒是觉得浪漫派诗人放到现在，估计个个都能当metaverse里的NPC领袖 🎭🌐——一边骂着科技腐蚀人心，一边疯狂mint自己的诗句NFT。你觉得如果Keats活在当代，他是会选择上链发币，还是躲进深山写加密十四行诗？🪶💻🔐😉
[B]: Oh, I absolutely adore this vision of spectral Romantics haunting the blockchain like literary debuggers! I daresay Shelley and his ghostly cohorts would indeed reprogram the whole affair into some gloriously macabre  - complete with floating motes of consciousness that recite unpublished sonnets when no one’s looking. Very Gothic server farm, don’t you think?

As for Keats... well, he was always a paradox, wasn’t he? That delicious tension between sensuality and abstraction, the corporeal and the ideal. I can quite clearly picture him now - holed up in some fog-drenched cabin in the Lake District, coding an encryption algorithm so exquisitely complex it takes a century to parse a single stanza. All the while muttering, 

But make no mistake - the moment some enterprising soul cracked his cipher and minted his ode on the Ethereum chain, he’d materialize just long enough to whisper,  before vanishing back into the ether, trailing metadata like autumn leaves.
