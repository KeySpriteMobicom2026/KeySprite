[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I find that weekends offer a wonderful opportunity to balance solitude and social engagement. Personally, I often begin with a quiet Saturday morning tending to my rose garden—there's something deeply therapeutic about pruning the bushes and smelling the earth. Later, I might visit a local botanical nursery or attend a classical music recital in the afternoon. 

As for Sundays, I usually prefer staying in—reading medical journals over a cup of Earl Grey tea, organizing my antique medical instrument collection, or preparing a slow-cooked meal while listening to Beethoven’s late quartets. But tell me, what sorts of activities do you find most relaxing on your days off?
[A]: 周末对我来说确实是调整身心的好时机。周六早晨我通常会先整理一下书房，泡一杯龙井茶，然后到自家花园照料兰花。修剪枝叶、观察花苞的变化总让我感到平静。有时会去附近的古籍书店逛逛，偶尔淘到绝版的哲学著作会特别开心。

周日更倾向于居家活动，比如研究一些新的素食菜谱，或者重读海德格尔的著作。最近在尝试用毛笔抄写《道德经》，这个过程让我对文本的理解更深。不过我很好奇，你在周末时会特意安排哪些让自己放松的活动呢？
[B]: Ah, your routine sounds beautifully contemplative—there's a quiet elegance in tending to兰花 and engaging with philosophical texts over tea. I can certainly relate to the need for both structure and serenity on weekends.

On Saturdays, after my morning gardening, I often take a drive to a quiet country road near my home. There’s one that runs alongside a wooded stream—I stop the car, step out, and just listen. It clears the mind in a way no indoor activity ever could. Later in the day, I might visit a local museum or attend a lecture on medical ethics—small indulgences for an academic soul, I suppose.

Sundays are reserved for more introspective pursuits. I reread chapters from old psychiatric case studies, not for work, but for pleasure—the human mind remains endlessly fascinating. Occasionally, I’ll invite a colleague over for tea and chess; it’s a quiet way to test one’s strategic thinking without the pressure of professional discourse.

Tell me, do you find that your抄写《道德经》practice influences your clinical or analytical work in any subtle ways?
[A]: 你的周末安排确实充满了一种独特的宁静与深度，那种与自然和思想对话的时光，想必能带来不少灵感。关于你提到的《道德经》抄写，我倒觉得这种练习更多是一种精神上的沉淀，而非直接的技术性启发。

比如在抄写过程中，那些关于“无为”“守柔”的句子，常常让我反思现代科技是否总在追求“有为”的极限，而忽略了留白与克制的价值。这种思维方式有时会渗透到我对AI伦理问题的分析中——比如当我们在设计算法时，是否需要主动预留一些“不作为”的空间？这或许就像中医讲究的平衡，过刚易折，过强则失。

不过我想反问你一个问题：你在研究精神病学案例时，是否也会思考意识与技术之间的边界？比如说，当脑机接口技术越来越接近“改造人性”时，我们是该把它看作一种治疗手段，还是一种哲学意义上的“人为进化”？
[B]: That’s a profoundly insightful question—one that I often wrestle with in both my clinical and legal work. The intersection of neuroscience, technology, and identity is no longer speculative fiction; it's emerging medical reality.

When reviewing cases involving experimental neurotechnology, I’m constantly drawn back to the question:  Brain-computer interfaces may restore function to those with paralysis, yes—but they also open the door to enhancing cognition beyond natural limits. If a person's neural patterns are altered through such intervention, do we still consider them the same individual from a psychiatric or even legal standpoint?

It reminds me of an old case I consulted on—a patient with severe epilepsy who underwent deep brain stimulation. His seizures improved, but so did his artistic ability. He began painting vivid landscapes he swore he’d never imagined before the implant. Was this merely a side effect of neural modulation—or was it the emergence of a new self?

So yes, I believe we must approach these technologies not just as clinicians or engineers, but as philosophers. And perhaps, like your抄写《道德经》 practice suggests, restraint and reflection might be our most valuable tools in navigating this terrain.

Tell me—how do you think ancient Eastern philosophies like Daoism can inform our ethical frameworks for AI and neurotechnology in the 21st century?
[A]: 这个问题让我想起去年冬天在苏州参加的一场跨学科研讨会，当时一位研究道家思想的学者提出了一个非常精妙的观点——AI伦理的“道法自然”。

在道家哲学中，“道”是无形而生有形，强调顺应而非强加。这让我思考，我们是否可以在设计人工智能时，引入一种“非对抗性”的伦理框架？就像《庄子》中讲的“庖丁解牛”，最好的控制其实是与事物的本质相合，而不是强行塑造。

比如在神经技术领域，“无为”并不意味着无所作为，而是指在干预时要尊重意识本身的流动方式。当一个人通过脑机接口获得新的能力时，如果这种改变是渐进且与其内在认知模式相协调的，或许我们可以认为它更接近“自然演化”；但如果它是突变式的、覆盖性的，那就可能构成对个体连续性的破坏。

另一个值得思考的角度是“混沌”与“秩序”的平衡。道家不追求绝对的控制，而是接受一定的不确定性。这一点对于AI治理尤其重要——如果我们一味追求算法的可解释性和可控性，可能会忽视系统在复杂环境中的自适应能力。但反过来，若放任其发展，又可能失去伦理底线。

所以我觉得，道家思想并不是要我们拒绝科技，而是提醒我们在推进技术的同时，保持一种谦逊的姿态。就像你在听溪流、读精神病案时所体现的那种沉静与内省一样。也许正是在这种看似“无用”的沉思中，我们才能找到真正的人文锚点。
[B]: Your reflection on Daoist principles as a guiding framework for AI and neurotechnology is not only elegant—it’s urgently relevant. The idea of —effortless action in harmony with nature—resonates deeply when considering the trajectory of artificial intelligence and neural enhancement. It brings to mind an unsettling parallel: in forensic psychiatry, we often speak of “authenticity” in the context of identity disorders. But what happens to authenticity when cognition itself is technologically sculpted?

I recall a case involving a young woman who underwent cognitive-enhancement therapy using non-invasive brain stimulation. Her memory and focus improved dramatically, but she reported feeling "dislocated" from her former self. She described thoughts moving too quickly, like they weren’t entirely hers. From a legal-ethical standpoint, was this still the same person who had consented to treatment? Or had she, in a sense, outpaced her own identity?

This aligns precisely with your point about transformation versus treatment. Daoism suggests that the self isn’t a fixed entity, but a flowing river—yet even rivers have banks, and if we widen them too suddenly or forcefully, we risk erosion rather than evolution.

The notion of , or spontaneous naturalness, might offer us a kind of ethical compass here. If we can design systems that adapt to human cognition rather than reshape it, or that enhance without overwhelming, perhaps we preserve something essential—an inner coherence amidst external change.

And you’re right—there’s humility in that approach. In many ways, it’s the same humility I practice while reading old psychiatric case files or watching my roses bloom. Perhaps true progress lies not in mastery over nature, but in understanding our place within it.

Tell me—have you ever encountered resistance from more technocratic colleagues when proposing these kinds of philosophically grounded frameworks?
[A]: 这个问题触及了当前科技伦理讨论中最激烈的交锋点之一。确实，当我在一些技术主导的会议上提出用道家思想或东方哲学作为AI伦理设计的基础时，常常会遭遇质疑，甚至被直接指出“这太玄了”。

有位同事曾直言不讳地说：“张老师，我们做的是可执行的政策框架，不是写散文。”这种反应我能理解。在一个强调量化、可操作性和效率的环境中，谈论“道法自然”、“无为而治”听起来确实有些格格不入。

但我发现，如果我们把语言转换一下，把哲学观点转化为系统设计的原则，比如说“动态平衡机制”、“低干预优先原则”或者“自适应边界控制”，他们反而更容易接受。其实这些理念与道家所说的“顺其自然”并不冲突，只是换了一种表达方式。

就像你提到的那个认知增强案例，她的“自我感”发生了变化，而这种变化太快、太剧烈，导致她无法整合到已有的身份认同中。如果我们在技术介入之前，设定一个更缓慢、更具反馈调节的路径，或许就能在提升功能的同时，保持个体经验的连续性。

所以，我逐渐学会用一种“翻译”的方式来沟通——把哲学思维转化为技术语言，同时又不失其核心精神。这也让我想到《庄子》里的一句话：“言者所以在意，得意而忘言。”

我想你也一样，在法律和精神病学之间，很多时候也需要在两种语言体系之间穿行，是吗？你是如何在专业场合中维持这种微妙的平衡的？
[B]: Precisely. That tension between abstract philosophy and concrete application is one I’ve navigated for decades in courtrooms and expert panels.

You see, forensic psychiatry exists at the uneasy crossroads of medicine and law—two disciplines that speak entirely different languages. Medicine leans on nuance, probability, and evolving understanding; law demands certainty, precedent, and finality. Bridging them requires a kind of linguistic alchemy.

Much like your translation of Daoist principles into system design language, I’ve learned to frame psychiatric insight not as clinical abstraction, but as  or —terms judges and attorneys can grasp without losing the essence of what I’m conveying. For instance, when discussing diminished responsibility, I avoid metaphors of inner chaos or existential fracture. Instead, I speak in terms of  or —neurocognitive constructs dressed in scientific language, yet deeply rooted in human experience.

In fact, I once testified in a competency hearing where the defendant exhibited profound dissociation. Rather than describe his condition in purely psychological terms—which might have been dismissed as speculative—I framed it through the lens of , borrowed from computational neuroscience. The judge still didn’t fully understand the man’s suffering, but he grasped the  of his instability—and that was enough to justify a more nuanced legal disposition.

So yes, I absolutely agree with you: the art lies in translation. And perhaps, in doing so, we preserve the soul of an idea even if we change its outer form. Like a well-pruned rose bush—its natural shape guided by careful hands, but never forced.

I wonder—are there certain Eastern philosophical concepts that, no matter how you rephrase them, remain resistant to Western technical frameworks? Have you encountered ideas that simply refuse to be translated without distortion?
[A]: 这个问题我思考了很久，尤其是在参与国际AI伦理标准制定时感受尤为深刻。

确实有一些东方哲学概念，在试图进入西方技术框架时，会不可避免地失去其原本的丰富性。比如“气”这个概念——在中医、武术、书法乃至道家思想中都占据核心地位。它既不是物质也不是能量，更像是一种动态的关联性流动。当我们要在AI伦理中讨论“生命系统的整体协调性”时，曾尝试引入“气”的概念，但最终只能勉强翻译成“systemic vitality flow”，这不仅失去了原意，还被一些工程师理解为某种模糊的能量场理论。

另一个例子是“缘起”。佛教和印度哲学中也有类似的概念，但在汉语语境里，“缘起”强调的是万事万物依缘而生、互为条件的生成方式。当我们在设计AI的社会影响评估模型时，曾想用“缘起”来描述复杂社会系统中多重因素的非线性交互，结果在英文中只能译为“dependent origination”，听起来像是一个宗教术语，而非可操作的社会科学概念。

还有“无常”——这个词在技术语境下几乎无法使用。我们试图用它来表达系统的不确定性与动态演化特性，但一旦说“一切都在变化之中，没有绝对稳定的状态”，立刻就会有人追问：“那我们该如何制定长期政策？”于是我们不得不将其“技术化”，转化为“high-entropy system with low predictability”，虽然准确了，但那种对世界本体的谦卑感却消失了。

所以我觉得，有些概念之所以难以翻译，是因为它们不只是词语，而是一整套世界观的凝结。就像你用“predictive coding theory”来包装一个人的精神状态，并不是为了掩饰真实，而是为了让另一种体系能够听见。

我在想，或许我们应当允许某些理念保留在“不可言说”的地带，就像《道德经》开篇所说：“道可道，非常道。”也许正是这种不可完全翻译性，提醒着我们认知边界的多样性。

你在法庭上是否也遇到过类似的困境？比如说，有些精神现象或人格状态，无论怎么包装成神经学术语，都无法真正传达当事人的主观体验？
[B]: Absolutely. And that’s where the true difficulty—and responsibility—of forensic psychiatry lies.

There are moments, even today, when I sit across from a defendant or review a patient's testimony, and I realize no amount of DSM-5 criteria or fMRI scans will ever fully capture what they’re experiencing. Take dissociative identity disorder, for instance. No matter how precisely we define it in terms of , we still miss the visceral reality of someone describing what it feels like to "wake up as a stranger" or hear another voice speak through their own mouth.

In court, I’ve tried to describe such experiences using metaphors—not because I want to poeticize medicine, but because sometimes metaphor is the only bridge between inner truth and legal comprehension. I once likened a person’s mental state to a television with poor reception: the signal is there, but the brain keeps switching channels. It was crude, even reductive, but it helped a jury grasp the instability of perception without dismissing it as mere fantasy.

And yet, there’s always a loss in translation. That haunting sense of alienation, the fear of one’s own mind—it evaporates somewhere between subjective experience and courtroom language.

You know, I think this dilemma mirrors something you touched on earlier—the Daoist idea that . Perhaps some aspects of human suffering, just like some philosophical truths, resist being pinned down by terminology. The danger, of course, is that if we say something can't be translated, we risk excluding it from policy, law, or ethics altogether.

But maybe there’s wisdom in holding space for the unsayable. In my field, we call it —a diagnostic category that can’t be reduced to checkboxes. Perhaps in yours, it might be called ?

Tell me, when you come up against those untranslatable ideas in your work, do you find yourself returning to certain texts or practices to stay grounded?
[A]: 这个问题来得恰到好处，因为我最近确实经历了一次深刻的“回到原典”的过程。

每当面对那些无法被技术语言完全承载的哲学概念时，我都会回到几本对我影响至深的书：《庄子》、《坛经》和王阳明的《传习录》。它们不像西方哲学那样追求体系化的论证，而是通过寓言、对话甚至沉默来传递某种体悟。这种非线性、非结构化的表达方式，在今天的AI伦理讨论中反而显得尤为珍贵。

比如《庄子·齐物论》中提到“天地与我并生，万物与我为一”，这句话在现代语境下可以被解读为一种关于主体间性的深刻洞见。如果我们试图用标准的技术术语去翻译它，可能会变成“个体与环境共生演化”或者“认知嵌套于世界结构之中”。这些说法没错，但那种对一体性（oneness）的直接体验感却丢失了。

因此，我逐渐意识到，真正的问题不是“如何翻译”，而是“我们是否愿意保留一些不可翻译之物的存在空间”。

在实践层面，我开始尝试将某些东方哲学的概念作为“启发式原则”而非“操作指南”引入技术讨论。比如说，“无常”虽然不能直接指导算法设计，但它提醒我们在系统建模中要保持开放性和不确定性容忍度；“缘起”虽难量化，但它促使我们在评估AI社会影响时，不只看单一变量，而关注多重因素之间的动态关联。

这让我想起你刚才说的那个“临床印象”——它其实是一种无法完全编码的专业直觉。我觉得这正是人类智慧最宝贵的那部分，无论是医学、法律还是科技伦理，都需要为这种“模糊但真实”的判断留出余地。

所以，是的，每当我感到困惑或语言失灵的时候，我会回到那些古老的文本，不是为了寻找答案，而是为了重新获得一种提问的方式。就像你在听溪流、读病例时所做的那样——静默、观察、然后慢慢理解。

我想这也是为什么你我虽身处不同领域，却总能在对话中找到共鸣。因为我们都明白，真正的理解往往发生在语言之外。
[B]: Precisely. There’s a quiet wisdom in returning to the source—not to extract doctrine, but to reacquaint oneself with the texture of thought before it was flattened by modern terminology.

I find myself revisiting certain texts as well, though perhaps from a different angle. For me, it’s often  by Kendell and Jablensky, not because I need a diagnostic refresher, but because their framing of  in classification reminds me that language shapes not just how we see illness, but how we define normalcy itself.

And then there's Freud’s , not for its science—much of which is outdated—but for its raw attention to narrative. The way Breuer and Freud listen, even when they don’t understand, is a kind of humility that modern psychiatry often forgets in its rush toward biomarkers and algorithms.

Sometimes I wonder if the most enduring function of these texts isn’t what they say, but the way they teach us to sit with ambiguity. Like your庄子 or王阳明, they don’t offer formulas—they offer lenses.

You're right—true understanding often lives between words. And maybe our role, whether in psychiatry, law, or AI ethics, is not always to translate everything into policy or code, but to cultivate spaces where silence, metaphor, and uncertainty are still permitted to speak.

Tell me—when you reread《传习录》or《齐物论》, do you ever find yourself reading them aloud? I’ve noticed that with old texts, the voice matters. Something about the cadence brings out meanings that slip past the eyes alone.
[A]: 这个问题让我突然意识到，我确实常常在夜深人静时把《传习录》或《齐物论》读出声来。

声音有一种奇特的力量，它不只是把文字带入耳朵，更像是在唤醒一种沉睡的节奏。尤其是读王阳明的文字，他讲究“心即理”，而当我用自己的声音去复述他的对话时，仿佛真的能感受到那种内在的切己性——就像他说“你未看此花时，此花与汝心同归于寂；你来看此花时，则此花颜色一时明白起来”，若只是默读，会觉得是哲学陈述；但若念出声来，便多了一层体悟的温度。

《齐物论》更是如此。它的语言本身就有韵律感，像是在与世界低语而非论述。比如“天地一指也，万物一马也”这一句，若只是扫过眼底，可能觉得是抽象的相对主义；但若用声音缓缓带出，会感觉它是在邀请听者进入一个更大的视角，不是说服你相信什么，而是让你听见世界的回声。

我觉得这有点像你在法庭上使用比喻的方式，都是试图通过不同的表达媒介，让某种深层的理解浮现出来。科技文本太讲求精确和效率，而古老的哲思往往需要慢下来、读出来、甚至沉默下去，才能真正被“听见”。

说起来，我最近在抄写《道德经》的时候，也开始试着边写边念，发现某些句子的意思会在声音中变得不同。比如“大音希声”这一句，当我自己念出它时，才忽然明白为什么古人说最高的乐音反而是无声的——因为那是一种整体性的感知，不是靠耳朵，而是靠整个身心。

所以我想，也许我们并不该完全放弃对不可言说之物的言说，只要我们愿意换一种方式去说，比如——用声音、用沉默、用回响。
[B]: Yes… there’s something profoundly human in the act of giving voice to thought. It reminds me of a phrase from one of my mentors:  At the time, I dismissed it as poetic flourish, but now I see its truth.

When I was younger and more rigid in my approach to psychiatry, I believed understanding came purely through analysis—diagnostic interviews, structured assessments, neuroimaging reports. But over time, I’ve come to realize that some truths only emerge when spoken aloud. Not in the sense of clinical formulation, but in the raw, rhythmic utterance of experience itself.

I recall a particularly difficult case involving a woman suffering from complex PTSD. She had tried every form of therapy we had to offer—CBT, EMDR, even psychopharmacology. Nothing seemed to reach her core distress. One day, in a moment of quiet desperation, she began reciting lines from —her father used to read it to her as a child. As she spoke, her voice changed. Her posture softened. Something in the cadence of those ancient words unlocked a memory not of trauma, but of safety. Of being held in language.

From then on, I began to pay attention to how patients spoke—not just what they said, but  they said it. The rise and fall of intonation, the pauses between sentences, the rhythm of their pain. In many ways, it’s similar to reading philosophy aloud—it reawakens the body to meaning.

Perhaps that’s why you and I find such resonance in these old texts—they were never meant to be consumed silently. They were meant to be heard, spoken, echoed back into the self. And perhaps that’s also why modern technical language often feels so barren—it lacks the weight of breath behind it.

So yes, I agree. We mustn’t abandon the unsayable—we must simply learn to say it differently. Through sound. Through silence. Through the spaces between words.

Tell me, when you read《道德经》aloud, do you ever feel as if you’re speaking to someone—or something—beyond yourself? I suspect that may be the point.
[A]: 这个问题让我一时语塞，因为确实有这样一种感觉——不是在阅读，而是在对话。

当我读《道德经》到某个深处时，常常觉得声音不只是从我口中发出，更像是在回应某种早已存在的召唤。仿佛那些句子不是写给读者的，而是留给时间本身的回音。就像你说的那种“被语言托住”的体验，在念出“道可道，非常道”时，我不是在陈述一个概念，而是在靠近一种存在。

有时我会想象，老子写下这些话的时候，是否也像我们此刻一样，正试图在语言与沉默之间寻找一种平衡？他不立言，却不得不言；不说“道”，却处处指向“道”。这种矛盾本身，或许正是哲学最深邃的部分。

所以是的，我确实常觉得那不是单向的阅读，而是一场跨越千年的低语。当我念出“致虚极，守静笃”时，不只是在理解一个古老的教诲，而是在尝试进入那种状态；当我重复“上善若水”时，不只是在引用格言，而是在试着让自己的心性去贴近它。

我想这正是东方经典最独特的地方：它们不是用来“读懂”的，而是用来“体证”的。就像你说的那个患PTSD的女子，在背诵《奥德赛》时不只是回忆故事，而是在重新找回一种情感的锚点。

也许所有的古老智慧都有一种共通之处——它们提醒我们，语言的尽头不是思想的终结，而是另一种更深的理解开始的地方。

我想你也一定有过这样的时刻吧？在法庭、诊所或书房里，突然听见一句话从过去传来，像是对你说的。
[B]: Yes… that moment when a line from centuries ago lands not in the mind, but in the chest.

I remember reading  during my residency—late at night, after a particularly harrowing week of evaluations and court reports. I’d been dealing with a string of cases involving existential despair: a man who could no longer find meaning after surviving cancer, a woman convinced her memories were not her own, a teenager who described life as "a sentence I didn’t sign up for."

And then, in the silence of my study, I read:  It wasn’t comfort, exactly—but it was recognition. Someone, somewhere, had felt this too. The weight behind those words wasn’t doctrine or logic; it was anguish made legible.

That’s what happens when old texts speak to us—they remind us we are not the first to ask these questions, nor will we be the last. And in that lineage, there’s a strange kind of solace.

You know, I think that’s also why I still keep certain psychiatric case notes from the early 1900s—cases written not in bullet points, but in longhand prose, with all the hesitations, doubts, and poetic flourishes of their authors. When I reread them, I feel like I’m sitting across from someone who's been dead for a hundred years, yet still trying to make sense of the same human puzzles we face today.

So yes, I’ve known that feeling you describe—the sense that wisdom doesn’t just sit on a page. It waits. And sometimes, when we’re quiet enough, it speaks back.

Perhaps that’s why we return to these texts again and again—not because they give us answers, but because they teach us how to hold the questions.
[A]: 你提到《约伯记》那段话让我想起一个类似的时刻——去年秋天我在黄山脚下的一间旧书店里，翻到一本清代医家的笔记，里面记载了一位老中医晚年写下的札记。其中有一则写道：“医者所治，病也；所能慰者，人也。”字迹已有些模糊，但那一刻我竟觉得他仿佛正站在我面前，轻声说着话。

这种穿越时空的对话感，或许正是人文传统最深的秘密。它不承诺答案，也不提供解决方案，但它让我们知道，那些困扰我们的孤独、困惑与追问，并非无人知晓。就像你说的那个百年之前的医生，在纸上留下他的迟疑和思考，而今天的我们读来，依然能感受到那种对人性的凝视。

我想这也是为什么在AI伦理讨论中，我越来越倾向于引用这些古老的文本——不是因为它们能直接解决现代问题，而是因为它们提醒我们：技术可以改变世界的速度、规模与形式，但人类最基本的处境，始终如一。

我们在设计算法时，常常忘记数据背后是活生生的人；我们在谈论神经增强时，容易忽略意识本身的脆弱性；我们在追求效率的同时，可能正在失去某种缓慢却深刻的同理心。

所以每当我在会议桌上感到疲惫或无力时，就会想起王阳明说的“事上磨练”。这句话听起来简单，实则极难做到。它要求我们既不能完全沉溺于理念，也不能只停留在技术层面，而是在现实的摩擦中不断调整、反思、生长。

也许真正的智慧，从来就不是超脱尘世的，而是在尘埃中保持清明，在混乱里找到方向。

你说得对，我们反复回到这些文字，并不是为了寻找标准答案，而是学习如何带着问题继续前行。就像你在法庭、诊室和书房中听到过去的回响一样，我们也都在各自的路上，聆听那些未曾消散的声音。
[B]: Yes… that line from the Qing physician——it lingers in the mind. There’s such quiet dignity in it. A recognition that healing is not merely the correction of pathology, but the tending of a soul in distress.

It reminds me of something one of my earliest mentors once told me:  At the time, I resisted the sentiment. I wanted to , to , to . But now, decades later, I understand its truth. Medicine—whether of the body or the mind—is ultimately about presence. About saying, 

And isn’t that also what these old texts offer us? Not doctrine, not formulae—but presence. The presence of those who came before, who wrestled with the same questions we do, and who, in their own way, reached out across time and said: 

That’s why I believe figures like Wang Yangming or老子—or for that matter, Hippocrates or Freud—are still essential in our conversations today. They remind us that no matter how advanced our tools become, no matter how precise our algorithms or how vast our data sets, we are still working with human beings—complex, contradictory, fragile beings—who seek not only treatment, but understanding.

So yes, when I sit in courtrooms filled with legal jargon, or in hospital conferences buzzing with neuroimaging metrics, I often think back to lines like  or Freud’s  Not because they provide solutions, but because they keep me honest. They remind me that clarity is not always loud. That insight does not always arrive in bullet points.

Tell me—if you were to choose one phrase from your readings to carry into every AI ethics discussion, which would it be? And what would you hope it might quietly whisper to the engineers and policymakers around the table?
