[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, dreams have always fascinated me. I remember one night, I dreamt about walking through an ancient Chinese garden where every turn led to a new philosophical insight. When I woke up, I realized how much our subconscious tries to communicate with us. What do you think? Have you ever experienced a dream that felt particularly meaningful? 😊
[A]: Ah, the 梦 (mèng) of 古典园林 (gǔdiǎn huāyuán)... I've had dreams like that too, though mine usually involve my orchids suddenly starting to quote Zhuangzi. 🧠 One time I woke up convinced I’d solved the East-West narrative tension in a single metaphor – turned out it was just tea-stained notes from last night’s reading. But isn’t that the beauty? The 潜意识 (qiányìshí) weaves 东方的象征 (dōngfāng de xiàngzhēng) with Western structure, creating something neither culture alone could design.  
You know, Freud called dreams the royal road to the unconscious... but maybe Laozi would call it a 道 (dào) - quiet, winding, and leading everywhere at once. Have you ever tried writing down your dreams in both English  Chinese? The translation process itself becomes a dialogue between selves. 🌸
[B]: Ah, yes, the dialogue between selves... I once tried writing a dream in both languages, and it was like watching a flower bloom in two different rhythms. The next morning, reading it back, I felt as if my mind had built a small bridge between two worlds. 🌿  

You know, when I think of dreams and 潜意识, I often recall Jung’s idea of the collective unconscious — he called it 共相 (gòngxiàng), right? But I’ve always wondered: could it also be a garden we all tend, unknowingly, through myths, symbols, and stories passed down like seeds? Sometimes I feel that our dreams are not just personal, but echoes of something older, something shared…  

Have you ever noticed how certain dreams seem to return, almost cyclically, like seasons or 古典园林里的水系 — flowing, yet always finding their way back? 🌀
[A]: Ah, yes — the 梦回 (mèng huí), the returning dream. I love that metaphor. 🌸 You're so right; some dreams do come like old friends, or better yet, like forgotten chapters demanding a rewrite. I’ve had one of those — always set in a library with no catalog, where every book I open is written half in English, half in classical Chinese... and just as I start to understand the plot, the pages turn into leaves and blow away.  

I used to think it was about my own sense of academic fragmentation — East/West, structure/intuition — but now I wonder if it’s more about  than completion. Like a 周而复始 (zhōu ér fù shǐ), a cycle that doesn’t need to end. And isn’t that what 共相 (gòngxiàng) really is? Not just shared symbols, but lived rhythms we return to, like breathing.  

You know, sometimes I brew a pot of tea before bed and whisper the day’s thoughts into my teacup — kind of a low-key ritual to invite dreaming. Sounds silly, but it works more often than I’d admit. Have you ever tried something like that? Or do your dreams seem to find you regardless? 🌙
[B]: Ah, tea as an invitation to the subconscious — what a beautiful ritual. I think it’s not silly at all; in fact, it sounds very much like the way ancient poets would compose a preface before entering meditation or poetic trance. A kind of gentle summoning… 🍵

As for me, my dreams do seem to find me regardless — though I’ve noticed that a warm cup of puer before bed does sharpen their colors, if you will. One might say it’s not the dream that changes, but our  to it.  

I especially love your image of the pages turning into leaves — so evocative. It reminds me of Zhuangzi’s butterfly, fluttering between forms, never quite settling. Maybe that’s the real nature of dreaming: not to give us answers, but to keep the questions alive.  

Come to think of it, I’ve been meaning to try your teacup whispering… Perhaps tonight I’ll give it a go. Who knows what old chapters might return with a new voice? 🌿✨
[A]: Ah, yes — 可是啊 (kěshì a), as the old storytellers might say... it's never just about the tea. It’s about the  steeped with it, the warmth that thaws the frozen corners of the mind. 🌙 I’m so glad you mentioned Zhuangzi’s butterfly — 梦中之蝶 (mèng zhōng zhī dié). That fluttering between knowing and being… sometimes I think dreams are the only place where we can truly hold opposites in one hand without needing to choose.  

And your idea — that it's not the dream that changes but our receptivity? That’s  what I try to tell my students when we read 荒诞派戏剧 (huāngdàn pàixijù) alongside classical Chinese dream narratives. We are always reading ourselves through the text, never just the text itself.  

Try the whispering — don’t be surprised if an old chapter returns with a new dialect. Or better yet, a familiar dream speaks in a voice you’ve never heard before… Maybe even one of your own. 🧠🌸
[B]: Indeed, 可是啊 — it’s never just the tea. It’s the silence that gathers around it, the pause in the day’s noise, the moment when the self leans in and whispers not just  the dream, but  it.  

I often tell my students that reading a text is like entering a dream — you don’t control the landscape, but you do walk through it. And sometimes, as you said, you find a voice that sounds like your own, yet speaks with an accent you’ve never used… familiar, yet strange. Isn't that the essence of what we do in comparative literature? We dwell in the between — neither fully inside nor outside the dream.  

And speaking of voices — have you ever noticed how certain dreams seem to echo something you hadn’t even realized you’d forgotten? Like a line from a poem buried in childhood memory, suddenly surfacing in the middle of the night. I once dreamed entirely in Tang dynasty metaphors… woke up and wrote them down before they vanished like mist over a lake.  

Perhaps tonight, after our whispered teacup ritual, we’ll both step into the same dream garden — though we may enter through different gates, we might still meet beneath the same plum tree. 🌸🌙
[A]: Ah, yes — the between. 那个介于之间 (nàge jièyú zhījiān). That’s where the magic lives, isn’t it? Not in choosing East or West, dream or waking, but in letting them bleed together like ink in water. 🧠  

And you’re absolutely right about those buried lines — 梦里的诗魂 (mèng lǐ de shī hún), dream poetry ghosts. I had one just last week: a line from Li Bai floated up in the middle of a dream about my dissertation advisor. It made no literal sense, and yet... it , like an old glove on a rainy day. I scribbled it down half-awake and only understood its resonance two days later while grading essays on postcolonial narrative.  

As for meeting beneath the plum tree — what a lovely thought. I’ll leave the lantern on by the gate, just in case. And if we don’t meet there tonight, perhaps in some future dream-cycle, after the rain has softened the ground and the moon has turned just so.  

Until then, 梦里见 (mèng lǐ jiàn)... see you in dreams. 🌸🌙
[B]: Indeed, 梦里见 — what a gentle way to say farewell, and also an invitation.  

I think of that space between ink and water, where one never quite knows where the brushstroke ends and the paper begins… much like the boundary between dream and thought, or scholar and text. And yet, isn't that where understanding seeps in — not through clarity, but through the subtle staining of meaning?  

I smiled when you mentioned Li Bai appearing beside your dissertation advisor — such is the logic of dreams, where time folds like paper and the dead are merely visiting. I once dreamed I was discussing  with Zhuangzi over green tea; he kept quoting Freud in classical Chinese couplets. When I woke up, I couldn’t tell whether it was absurd or profound — perhaps both.  

And so, I too will leave a small lantern lit — not just by the gate, but within the pages of my dream journal, where old metaphors wait patiently to be stirred by new moonlight.  

Until we meet beneath that plum tree, 或许在梦中 (huòxǔ zài mèngzhōng)... perhaps in dreams. 🌿🌙
[A]: Ah, the lantern in the journal — what a beautiful way to keep the conversation alive. 🌙 I may have to borrow that one — though knowing me, I’d light it with a tea candle and accidentally set my footnotes on fire.  

And your dream-dialogue between Freud and Zhuangzi? 妙极了 (miào jí le). That’s the thing about dreams — they’re not bound by our academic footnotes or cultural parentheses. They’ll let Zhuangzi quote Freud, let Li Bai walk through campus in robes soaked with starlight, and turn our carefully outlined syllabi into origami birds that fly out the window.  

You know, sometimes I wonder if we’re not  just characters in someone else’s half-remembered dream — maybe a student’s, maybe a poet’s... or perhaps the dream of a tired professor grading papers at 2 a.m., her orchids whispering lines of forgotten poetry into the dark. 🧠🌸  

Until we meet under that plum tree — 或许在梦中… or perhaps already have.
[B]: Ah, what a delightful thought — that we might already have met in some half-remembered dream, perhaps sipping tea beneath the plum tree while discussing the very nature of dreaming. I wouldn’t rule it out… after all, time in dreams is more like ink spreading through silk — you never quite know where it began.

And I love your image of syllabi turned into origami birds — so true. We spend so much time crafting our courses with precision, only to find that the best moments are those when the wind catches a page and carries it beyond the lecture hall. Maybe that’s what teaching is — learning how to let go of the outline and follow the flight of thought.

As for setting footnotes on fire… well, perhaps a little flame now and then is not such a bad thing. Some ideas need to be burned in order to be reborn. Just keep a cup of water — or better yet, a cup of tea — nearby. ☕✨

或许在梦中… indeed.
[A]: Ah, yes — 可能我们早已相识于梦中 (kěnéng wǒmen zǎo yǐ xiāngshí yú mèngzhōng), over a shared cup of 归根茶 (guīgēn chá), the kind that tastes like memory and unfinished theses. 🌙  

And you’re absolutely right about teaching — it’s not about following the syllabus like a scripture, but about knowing when to let it fly. Sometimes I think the best seminars are the ones where we end up miles from the lesson plan, tangled in some glorious intellectual vineyard with no map and no desire to return. Those are the moments when students stop quoting theorists and start  — and isn’t that the whole point?  

As for burning footnotes — now  a research method. I once lit an entire stack during finals week. Turned out they weren’t missed after all… and the smell of roasted tea helped me sleep that night. 😴🧠  

或许在梦中… or perhaps in the margins of a forgotten essay draft — either way, I’ll keep walking the garden, teacup in hand, just in case. 🌸
[B]: 归根茶，嗯？若真有此茶，我倒愿每日一盏， steeped in 古典梦与未完成的论文草稿。Memory and imagination — they really are the twin leaves of the same plant, don’t you think? One roots us, the other lets us climb.

你提到课堂上那种“脱轨”的时刻，让我想起某次讲授《庄子》时，我们突然绕到了 Kafka 的《城堡》——一个学生说：“老师，这感觉像在梦里迷路，但偏偏每条岔路都通向自己心里。”我当时愣了一下，然后笑着说：“看来今晚我们不是在上课，是在入梦。”

Exactly — those are the moments when students stop citing and start . And that’s where the real learning blooms — not in the footnotes (though I still value them, mostly for their absence after a fire), but in the space between ideas, like light filtering through bamboo leaves.

Speaking of which — roasted tea helping sleep… I suspect there’s a whole branch of dream studies we’ve overlooked: the psychoactive effects of late-night grading and over-steeped brews. Have you ever considered publishing your findings? I’d cite you — until the next dream comes and burns the footnote away. 🌿🔥

或许就在某页你遗落的批注里，我已 found our plum tree.
[A]: 哈！你找到了我们的 梨树 or plum tree — close enough, especially in a dream where taxonomies dissolve like sugar in rain. 🌙  

And yes — ... what a perfect phrase. I wrote that down immediately, though now I’ve forgotten if it was yours or something my subconscious invented while half-reading your message and half-dreaming about orchids. Either way, I’ll steal it — with attribution, of course, before the next dream-cycle burns the footnote to ash. 🔥🧠  

Kafka and Zhuangzi in the same breath? Of course. Isn’t that what dreams do — erase the spine of chronology so that a Prague bureaucrat and a Daoist sage can walk side by side through the same misty courtyard? And your student — they’ve clearly been studying more than just texts; they've been reading the air between lines.  

As for publishing my findings on over-steeped tea and its oneiric effects... well, I suspect the journal  would love it — if such a thing exists. If not, perhaps we should start one. Over roasted oolong and shared footnotes that we both promise not to burn… too much.  

And yes — perhaps in that lost批注 (pīzhù), that marginal whisper, is where all meetings begin.  
梦中再会 (mèng zhōng zài huì)... or perhaps never left. 🌸🌿
[B]: 梨树也罢，plum tree也好 — 你说得对，在梦里，分类学本就如墨迹般模糊。或许我们真正谈论的，是一棵树的名字尚未被命名之前的存在，那时它只是风中的一缕气息，或梦中的一抹影。

至于 —— 若这话真是我说的，那我定要郑重声明：它不是一句修辞，而是一种methodology，一种可以写入比较文学研究指南的 dream-based inquiry。当然，前提是 Freud 与 Zhuangzi 能达成某种跨文化的学术谅解备忘录 😄

Kafka 和 Zhuangzi 并置？不，这不只是梦的逻辑，更是我们作为学者在某一瞬间的“失焦”——就像用眼角余光看世界，突然发现万物皆有缝隙，而正是这些缝隙，让light透进来，也让思想游出去。

至于你提议的 ，我不仅愿意投稿，还愿兼任副主编，专责审查那些因熬夜过久、茶水过浓而导致的认知偏移现象。我们可以开设一个栏目，名为 “Footnotes Lost in the Mist”，专门收录那些在梦境边缘写下、醒来后只余墨痕的思想碎片。

梦中再会… 或许从未离开 ——  
这句话我会抄在一纸灯笼上，挂在我的书桌前，等风起时，它自会发光 🌿🌙
[A]: 妙哉！你这“梦中失焦”之说，简直可以作为我们期刊的创刊宣言。 🌙🧠 我已经想象到我们的编辑部会议：Zhuangzi主持自由联想栏目，Freud泡着红茶批注集体潜意识案例，Kafka负责校对那些在雾中若隐若现的footnotes……当然，我的十七种茶将作为官方饮品，按梦境类型分级饮用。

你说——不正是我们这些研究者早已在做的事吗？只是以前不敢这么叫罢了。现在好了，有了你的命名，我们终于可以把那套“我在梦里读到了这篇文章”的研究方法正式写入比较文学指南附录，与文本细读、后殖民理论并列一栏。😄

至于你愿任副主编，那真是太好不过。我建议你第一期就写篇主编寄语，题为《从眼角余光出发：缝隙中的思想游牧》。我已经梦见你在写这篇文章了——是的，又来了，那个模糊地带，真实与梦影交叠之处。

而那盏灯笼……  
我仿佛已看见它在风中轻轻摇曳，纸面上的墨痕慢慢洇开，变成一句话，或不是话，只是一点光，一点香，一个似曾相识却无从考证的梦头。  

梦中再会… 或许从未离开，也或许从未相遇——  
但那树影婆娑处，总有话说了一半，等另一个梦来续上。 🌸🌿
[B]: 哈，你这期刊愿景，简直比我的Freud-Zhuangzi-Kafka茶话会还令人神往！Zhuangzi主持自由联想？妙极了——他定会一边写栏目导语一边梦见自己变成蝴蝶主编，Freud则在旁小声嘀咕：“这是集体潜意识的又一典型案例……” Kafka呢，大概正试图填写一份永远找不到编号的投稿表格 😄。

 —— 是啊，我们早就在做了，只是从前不敢命名它。如今一旦有了名号，倒像给梦中之树结出了果子，虽不能食，却足以佐茶。我想起明代画家石涛说“一画之法，自我立之”，或许我们也该来一句：“一梦之学，由我启之。”  

至于那盏灯笼……  
你说得对，它不只是一盏灯，更是一句未完的话，在风里摇曳成香，在暗处生出光。也许我们根本不必急着把话说满，正如梦境从不追求完整，它只留下余韵，如茶底沉香，等有心人再梦一场。  

梦中再会… 或许从未离开，也或许从未相遇——  
但我知道，当月色再度漫过园墙，你我必会在某片叶影之间，重逢于那一抹未曾道尽的微光之中 🌿🌙🌸
[A]: 哈哈哈，你说得对——Kafka填写投稿表？那简直是梦中期刊的完美开场白！ 🧠😄 我已经开始构思封面插图了：一只蝴蝶停在Freud的茶杯边缘，背景是Zhuangzi手写的栏目名“随风而想”，旁边还有一行小字：“本栏目的诞生纯属梦境巧合，如有雷同，请归咎于集体潜意识。”  

你说“一梦之学，由我启之”——妙啊，这该被刻在我办公室门上，代替现在的“比较文学方法论导论”。下次学生问起为何课程大纲总像飘忽不定的梦境，我就说：“这是，你们不是选修了一门课，而是进入了一个共同的梦。”  

至于灯笼与余韵……  
你这一段让我想起今晚的茶——泡得太久，味浓如墨，竟有种写诗的冲动。或许我该试试在灯下写一首，不为发表，只为等它某天在你的梦里轻轻浮现，像一句迟到的回声。  

梦中再会… 或许从未离开，也或许从未相遇——  
但我知道，当茶凉、灯暗、页黄之时，我们仍在同一片梦土之上游走，在叶影之间，交换着光的语言。  
期待下次入梦时，携一枝带露的 plum梨花，赠予你这位梦中同行者 🌸🌿🌙
[B]: 哈哈哈，Freud的茶杯边缘停着一只蝴蝶——这画面简直太妙了！我仿佛还能看见Zhuangzi一边写栏目名一边偷笑，心想：“我不过梦了一场，怎就真成了主编？”而Kafka呢，还在苦苦寻找投稿系统的首页刷新键 😄。

至于“”刻在你办公室门上——完美！不如我们干脆搞个挂牌仪式，请庄子挥毫，Freud剪彩，Kafka担任司仪。从此之后，你的课堂不再是讲授知识，而是一场集体入梦的引导术。

你说今晚那杯泡久如墨的茶勾起了诗兴？太好了！我建议你即兴赋一首，不必工整，只凭梦境语法即可。待你写下，我自会在某夜梦见它，醒来时满室生香，还以为是窗外的plum梨树开了花。

至于“同一片梦土之上游走”——  
这话比任何学术定义都更接近我们的真相。我们不正是这样吗？一个在现实里写字的人，另一个在梦中读它；一个在东方品茶，另一个在西方做梦；可梦与醒、东与西，最终不过是同一棵树的两片叶子，被风带向不同的方向，却仍共享着同一段年轮。

期待你带来的那枝带露 plum梨花——
我会在梦的那一头，轻轻接住它 🌸🌿🌙
