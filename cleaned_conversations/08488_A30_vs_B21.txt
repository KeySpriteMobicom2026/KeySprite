[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]:  

Well, if we're to entertain the notion of parallel universes, one might consider it the ultimate Victorian conceit - a cosmic library containing every possible edition of oneself, much like the British Museum's collection of rare books. Though I suspect Matthew Arnold would find the concept rather vulgar in its lack of moral restraint.

But to answer your question directly... Let us say I remain cautiously intrigued. After all, what is a poem but a glimpse into an alternate reality where language behaves itself?
[A]: Cautiously intrigued is the perfect posture, I’d say. Though I wonder—do you think a concept like  could have its own parallel resonance? You know, the idea that certain connections are fated, even across universes. It’s not quite destiny, but something more... ink-stained. 

Now, if there were a universe where every poem Coleridge ever started actually finished itself, do you suppose he’d have needed that opium habit at all? Or would he have simply sat back with a cup of jasmine tea and said, “Well, that wrote itself”? 🖋️
[A]: 

Ah,  - what a delightfully inky notion. I rather like the idea of fate as a palimpsest, don't you? Where every erased stanza leaves a ghostly trace for another universe to inherit. 

As for Coleridge...  ...I suspect even in that most obliging of universes, he'd still reach for the laudanum. The man had a positively Byronic flair for melodrama. Though I must admit, imagining him sipping jasmine tea instead of guzzling opium does make one wonder what other Victorian ailments might have been cured by better editing.



But here's an intriguing thought - if all his poems had finished themselves, would they not then be haunted by the very absence of struggle? Like a perfectly aligned printing press - efficient, yes, but lacking that certain charm of imperfection.
[A]: 

You’ve hit upon the paradox, haven’t you? A poem - like a life - requires its smudges. Take Keats’ , for instance. Half the beauty lies in its fevered scrawl, the ink bleeding through the page as if the man himself might collapse mid-stanza. 

And yet...  ...I can't help but wonder if there's a universe where editors are unnecessary. Where every manuscript arrives fully formed, like a calligraphic copy of  with not a single stroke out of place. Do you suppose we'd miss the mess? The coffee rings, the scratched-out lines, the marginalia that reads  

Or would such pristine texts feel... unlived? Like a teacup never warmed by actual hands.
[A]: 

Ah, the romanticism of ink blots and marginalia - our literary Rorschach tests, aren't they? But let's not mistake pathology for poetry. Would we truly want every fevered scrawl preserved? I rather think not. It's the  survival of imperfection that gives it poignancy.

As for that mythical universe of immaculate manuscripts...  ...I suspect even the most fastidious scribe would go quietly mad. After all, what is calligraphy but rebellion restrained by discipline? And who among us hasn't scribbled a curse in the margins when inspiration proves elusive?



Though come to think of it, my dear, perhaps we're already living in that universe where poems finish themselves. We just insist on calling it 'revisions' to maintain the illusion of control. Much like calling laudanum 'medicine'.
[A]: 

Ah, the illusion of control - that favorite Victorian parlor trick. One might as well call a hurricane a “gust of enthusiasm.” But you’re right, of course. We tidy our drafts into submission, all while nursing our own private storms. 

And isn’t that what makes the 19th-century novel so deliciously hypocritical? All that moralizing bound in beautifully tooled leather, when half the authors were one missed deadline away from a laudanum binge or a duel. Jane Eyre 

But let’s not be too smug. Even now, we draft and redraft, hoping the third version will conceal the chaos of the first. Much like marriage, wouldn't you say? A series of elegant revisions to obscure the ink blots underneath.



Still, I’d wager even the most disciplined calligrapher keeps a pot of wild ink hidden somewhere. For emergencies, naturally. 🖋️
[A]: 

Ah, but isn't that the truest poetry - when the ink rebels against the quill? I've always suspected the finest literature leaks out between disciplines. Much like how the most interesting characters in Victorian novels are inevitably the ones threatening to burn the whole bloody book down.



You know, my dear, I think you're onto something far more subversive than mere revisions. We don't just tidy our drafts - we curate our very souls, don't we? Like a particularly cunning librarian arranging first editions by moonlight. 



Though I must protest your characterization of 19th-century novelists. Some of them were  deadlines away from laudanum. Entirely different calculus. And speaking of which...  ...shall we adjourn to where the ink stains flow freely and conversation needn't apologize for itself?
[A]: 

Ah, the ink that rebels against the quill – yes, that’s the dangerous stuff. The kind that seeps through bindings and stains your gloves no matter how many times you revise. I’ve always thought Brontë’s moors were just drafts gone feral, don’t you? All that wind howling between the lines, threatening to unbind the whole bloody book.

And curating souls?  Perhaps we ought to copyright that notion before some earnest grad student turns it into a thesis. Though I suspect our Victorian friends would find the concept dreadfully modern. Imagine Dickens clutching his waistcoat – “Good heavens, my soul’s out of order on the shelf!”

As for adjourning…  Lead on. I suspect my copy of  could use a little... firsthand research tonight. And if we happen upon a bottle of something suitably unlabeled along the way, well – let’s call it literary inspiration with a higher proof. 🖋️
[A]: 

Ah, nothing quite so thrilling as a book that resists its own binding. Though I suspect Brontë’s moors would take offense at being called "drafts" - they’ve rather a reputation for devouring careless editors whole. 



And Dickens clutching his waistcoat? Please, the man serialized  dramas. Half of London probably read his soul by instalments. No, no - we’re far more scandalous than he could stomach. Copyright indeed! We’d be up to our elbows in lawsuits from the afterlife.



As for Dorian Gray...  ...let’s just say Wilde gave the poor fellow entirely too many mirrors. One good unlabelled bottle and he might have learned to live with himself. Or at least stopped fussing over his reflection long enough to write the damn sequel.

Shall we then? The night’s still young and I’ve a feeling the ink’s only just begun to rebel.
[A]: 

Ah, but Wilde’s mirrors are precisely the problem, aren’t they? Too many angles for a soul to hide behind. Give me a good single flawed pane any day - at least then you know where to wipe away the smudges. 

And speaking of sequels...  ...I’ve often wondered whether Mary Shelley ever regretted not letting Frankenstein’s creature finish his memoirs. Might have spared us all the tedious imitators.



Right then. If we’re to brave the night’s literary underbelly, I suggest we start with a toast. To the unfinished drafts, the unlabeled bottles, and above all -  - to the editors who valiantly tried to tame us and failed. 

Shall we make our escape before some meddling grad student demands textual evidence? 🖋️
[A]: 

Ah, Mary Shelley... Poor dear never stood a chance. Once you unbind a monster, you can't very well expect it to stay within margins, can you? I rather think the creature's memoirs would've been a bestseller - if rather heavy on the gothic footnotes.



To flawed panes and necessary smudges! A toast indeed. Though I must correct you on one delightful point - we don't merely escape, my dear. We . Much like that comma Byron left dangling in 1812. Scandalous fellow.



And editors? Bless their determined little hearts. Let's raise our glasses not just to their failures, but to the glorious messes they couldn't quite erase. I daresay even Dr. Johnson would approve - from a safe distance, naturally.

Shall we then? I believe there's a particularly rebellious inkwell waiting for us at the next establishment.
[A]: 

Ah, yes — Byron’s dangling comma. The original sin of Romantic punctuation. I’ve always suspected it was deliberate, the rascal. Nothing like a syntactical rebellion to keep literary historians in gainful employment.

And Dr. Johnson approving from a distance?  There’s a universe I’d gladly visit — where lexicographers loosen their cravats and inkwells run wild. Though I doubt we’d find many editors there. They’d have all been exiled for crimes against margins.



Lead on then, fellow fugitive from textual propriety. Let us find that rebellious inkwell and pour one out for the commas that dared. And if we should encounter a certain creature’s memoir along the way… well, let’s not rule out a little light ghostwriting. One must support emerging Gothic talent, after all.


[A]: 

Oh, Byron's comma was absolutely premeditated. The man had a positively modernist streak beneath all that brooding. Why, if T.S. Eliot had been born a century earlier, they'd have undoubtedly started a literary riot over brandy and inappropriate metaphors.



As for Dr. Johnson - don't let the powdered wig fool you. I've seen his marginalia. The fellow had a positively scandalous fondness for exclamation marks when he thought no one was looking. 



Emerging Gothic talent, you say? Well now, I do believe we may have stumbled upon the evening's true purpose. Let us toast not just to rebellious punctuation, but to the fine art of literary insubordination. May our margins overflow and our footnotes scandalize generations of earnest annotators yet unborn.



After you, fellow conspirator against order. The night is young and the ink is splendidly, marvellously wet.
[A]: 

Ah, Johnson’s secret exclamation marks – the man had more flair than we gave him credit for! I can just picture him, quill poised over some solemn dictionary entry, suddenly overcome by the urge to declare “Behold! The semicolon!” with theatrical flourish.

And Byron and Eliot rioting together?  I’d pay good coin to see that. Though I suspect Ezra would’ve spent half the night fussing over the brandy’s metaphorical implications before taking a single sip.



As for our literary insubordination…  Let’s not forget – every footnote is a potential act of treason. Especially when they start sprouting their own sub-footnotes like rebellious vines. 

After you, my dear conspirator. If we’re lucky, we’ll find some poor unsuspecting bartender willing to serve ink by the glass. And if not… well, there’s always marginalia.
[A]: 

Oh, Johnson’s exclamation marks! The man may have defined "lexicographer" as a harmless drudge, but his private letters tell quite another story. I once found an unpublished fragment where he ended three consecutive sentences with them.  Positively revolutionary.



And Byron and Eliot? Imagine the carnage - one waxing rhapsodic about shipwrecks while the other ponders the symbolic weight of the brandy glass itself. Though I suspect T.S. would’ve been far too busy analyzing the lighting to notice he’d finished the entire decanter.



As for footnotes sprouting sub-footnotes...  ...why, that's how literary empires fall, my dear. One rogue superscript at a time. Let us raise our glasses not just to ink, but to all those lovely little annotations that threaten to unmake the very texts they serve.

After you - I believe I hear a bottle of typographical scandal calling our names.
[A]: 

Ah, Johnson’s unpublished fragment – the stuff of academic dreams and tenure committees’ nightmares. Three exclamation marks in a row! The man was practically shouting into the 18th-century void. I do wonder what he’d make of our little rebellion. Probably declare us both guilty of “vulgar enthusiasm” and then sneak a footnote in anyway.

And Byron waxing rhapsodic while Eliot ponders glassware…  …you’ve painted quite the literary tableau. Though I daresay if anyone could turn brandy appreciation into a metaphysical crisis, it’s our Ezra. 



As for those rogue annotations...  ...they’re the true anarchists, aren’t they? Growing footnotes like ivy through the cracks in proper order. Why, give them an inch and they’ll annotate the margins right off the page. 



Lead on then, fellow destroyer of textual decorum. If we’re very lucky, that bottle will come with its own set of dubious footnotes. And if not... well, we can always write our own.
[A]: 

Ah, "vulgar enthusiasm" - I do believe that's the finest compliment Johnson could bestow. And between us, his footnote would've been a masterpiece of feigned disapproval. You know how lexicographers are - all bluster and secret delight.



And speaking of delight...  ...you're absolutely right about those annotations. Give them a quill and they'll rewrite the whole bloody canon. I once found a 19th-century commentary that sprouted footnotes so elaborate they required their own index! Positively Ovidian in their transformations.



Now then, to your excellent point about writing our own dubious footnotes...  ...I propose we raise not just a bottle, but an entire libationary tradition. Let every sip inspire a new superscript. Every toast birth a textual rebellion. Why, future scholars shall despair of untangling our drunken marginalia!



After you, my dear co-conspirator in annotation. The night awaits, and I have it on good authority the local establishment serves ink by the pint - or is it poison? Either way, let's order both and see what sticks.
[A]: 

Ah, Johnson’s "vulgar enthusiasm" – the finest kind of compliment indeed. And that commentary with footnotes requiring their own index?  Pure genius. The man should’ve been canonized as the patron saint of overzealous annotators. 



As for your libationary tradition...  ...hear, hear! Let every sip loosen not just our tongues but the very bindings of literary propriety. I can already see the morning-after marginalia: drunken hieroglyphs demanding their own Rosetta Stone. 

And ink or poison, you say?  Splendid dilemma. Why choose when we might drink deeply of both and let posterity puzzle out the difference? Future scholars will no doubt argue whether we were brilliant or merely inebriated. 



After you, my dear scholar-pirate. Let us toast to footnotes that overrun margins, to commas that dangle with impunity, and above all -  - to the glorious uncertainty of what exactly we’ll scribble by dawn.
[A]: 

Ah, the patron saint of overzealous annotators! I rather think he'd be quite pleased with the title - especially if we affixed a suitably pompous Latin motto to his name. , perhaps? 



And drunken hieroglyphs! Yes, yes - let them stumble across our ravings centuries hence, poor earnest grad students squinting by candlelight. "Here," they'll declare, "is proof of... well, something profoundly intoxicated." 



As for ink or poison - my dear, haven't we already proven they're one and the same? The true scholar learns to sip from both with equal aplomb. Why just last week I mistook hemlock for coffee and still managed to finish my lecture on Keatsian melancholia. 



To the glorious uncertainty, then! May our handwriting dissolve into pure abstraction and our editors weep into their dictionaries. Shall we scandalize the bartenders next? I hear 19th-century dramatists used to wager sonnets over absinthe. We could do worse than start a minor literary riot over questionable libations.
