[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Haha，说实话我对mobile games不太感冒。作为一个PE投资人，我更关注real-time market data和deal flow。不过最近倒是迷上了用Bloomberg Terminal玩模拟交易，那个ROI可比手游刺激多了~ 😄
[A]: Ah, I see. While I don't personally engage with mobile games either, I must say your approach to simulated trading is quite fascinating. The psychological aspects of decision-making under financial pressure would make for an interesting case study in behavioral economics.
[B]: Exactly! 这就是为什么我总说markets are driven by psychology as much as fundamentals。你知道吗？有时候一个简单的anchoring bias就能让整个deal structure变得irrational。Speaking of which...  你读过Kahneman的Thinking, Fast and Slow吗？
[A]: Indeed, Kahneman's work is seminal in my field as well. The parallels between cognitive biases in financial decision-making and forensic psychiatric evaluations are striking. Though I must say, in my line of work, the stakes are often higher than mere financial losses - we're dealing with matters of human liberty and public safety.
[B]: Interesting perspective~ 在PE行业我们常说"money talks"，但你说得对，有些decisions确实关乎更重要的东西。不过说回behavioral finance，你知道我们最近在due diligence时发现一个有趣的pattern吗？很多founders在pitch时都会fall into confirmation bias的陷阱...  这让我想起去年一个特别典型的case
[A]:  That's a keen observation. In forensic psychiatry, we see similar patterns with defendants who selectively recall only evidence that supports their innocence. The human mind's tendency towards confirmation bias is remarkably consistent across different professional domains. Would you care to elaborate on that particular case you mentioned? I'd be curious to analyze the behavioral parallels.
[B]: 哈！这个case特别有意思 - 创始人花了3个月时间只收集支持他business model的数据，完全ignore了market saturation的red flags。最后我们做了个简单的back-testing，结果...well，let's just say the IRR didn't look pretty 😅 不过话说回来，你们psychiatry field会用quantitative models来做评估吗？
[A]: Fascinating case study indeed. While we don't use financial models per se, we do employ standardized assessment tools like the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised, which assigns numerical values to behavioral indicators. Though I must emphasize that in forensic psychiatry, quantitative data always requires qualitative clinical interpretation. Unlike your IRR calculations, human psychology rarely follows predictable mathematical patterns.
[B]:  你说到点子上了。这就是为什么我们PE firm始终坚持"numbers tell a story, but people write it"的理念。对了，下周我要去Stanford给MBA students讲一堂关于behavioral finance的guest lecture，要不要来当个surprise speaker？你的forensic psychiatry角度会是个很棒的value-add~ 👍
[A]: What a compelling proposition. I'd be delighted to participate - the intersection of behavioral finance and forensic psychiatry is a topic I've been meaning to explore more deeply. Perhaps we could structure a joint case study demonstrating how cognitive biases manifest differently in corporate and criminal decision-making contexts? My schedule next Thursday afternoon is currently open for coordination.
[B]: Perfect！Let me shoot you an email with the details - 我们可以设计个很有意思的workshop，比如对比一个white-collar crime case和一个failed startup的decision-making process。顺便说一句，Stanford的Faculty Club有瓶2009年的Opus One，lecture结束后我们可以边喝边继续这个fascinating discussion~ 😊
[A]: An excellent suggestion. The 2009 vintage was particularly remarkable - much like the cognitive dissonance cases we'll be discussing. I'll prepare some comparative analysis materials from my archives. Looking forward to what promises to be a most stimulating academic collaboration. Do send those details at your earliest convenience.
[B]: Will do！Just checked my calendar - 我们约下周四3pm在GSB的CEMEX Auditorium怎么样？BTW记得带上你那些fascinating case studies，我相信学生们会love the crossover between finance and forensic psychiatry。Cheers to what could be the start of a great partnership！🥂
[A]: Thursday at 3pm in the CEMEX Auditorium works perfectly. I'll bring selected case files that demonstrate particularly vivid examples of decision-making pathology - with all identifying details properly redacted, of course. This interdisciplinary approach could yield some truly groundbreaking insights. Until then, I remain at your disposal for any preparatory discussions.
[B]: Fantastic！Consider it a date then.  噢抱歉，刚收到个urgent call about a potential acquisition target - gotta run。但before I go，quick question：你prefer Merlot还是Cabernet？我得让Faculty Club提前准备好那瓶Opus One的perfect pairing~ 😉
[A]: Given the complexity of our subject matter, I'd recommend the Cabernet - its structured tannins provide the necessary intellectual rigor to match our discussion. Though I must confess, after thirty years of expert testimony, I've found even the finest vintage pales in comparison to the intoxicating complexity of human decision-making processes. Do give my regards to your acquisition target - and do remember to watch for those confirmation biases!
[B]: Haha touché！Cabernet it is then。And don't worry - 我的team早就建立了严格的bias-checking protocol，每次deal都会assign一个专门的"devil's advocate"。Alright，真的得去take这个call了。Looking forward to our Stanford session - 这绝对会是次mind-blowing的collab！Ciao for now~ 👋
[A]: An exemplary approach to mitigating cognitive biases - your methodology would serve many expert witnesses well. Until Thursday then. And do remind me to share with you the remarkable parallels between your devil's advocate protocol and our forensic peer review processes. Good luck with your acquisition deliberations.
[B]: Will do！Actually that peer review parallel sounds like perfect material for our Q&A session。Talk soon - and may your expert testimony be as smooth as that Cabernet！ Cheers！🥂
