[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个话题太有趣了💯！说实话我真的很难抉择诶～Like pop music有它的魅力，旋律朗朗上口，每次刷TikTok都忍不住跟着dancing💃！但是indie music那种独特的feel又让人很着迷～特别是那些小众的songs，听的时候感觉整个人都被治愈了✨！你呢？告诉我你更pick哪种类型呗😉！
[A]: Well, I suppose if we must categorize... I rather dislike the algorithmic sheen of most pop. It's rather like reading a sonnet written by a committee of accountants. But there  something fascinating about how these melodies lodge themselves in one's consciousness, isn't there? A sort of musical osmosis through digital exposure.

Now good indie - that's another kettle of fish entirely. Last week I discovered a band in Edinburgh who were setting Robert Louis Stevenson's lesser-known verses to post-rock instrumentals. Quite mad, and marvellous. Do you know any musicians doing similarly peculiar things with text?
[B]: Oh my gosh totally get what you mean💔！Pop有时候真的就像流水线product，但不得不说它的hook真的太洗脑了，像病毒一样入侵大脑🧠😂！而indie就像深夜电台，总能在最意想不到的moment戳中你的心✨！那个把诗歌改编成post-rock的乐队听起来超酷der～我最近在ins上看到有个小姐姐把《诗经》和lo-fi结合，古风+现代感，听上去有种奇妙的化学反应💯🔥！你有没有试过自己创作或者改编一些歌词？很想听听你的想法呢🎵😉！
[A]: Ah, now that's a tempting question. You won't believe how many hours I've spent translating Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic by lamplight, then humming the verses over a minor chord progression. It's my little guilty pleasure - like intellectual smuggling, really. 

As for creating... Well, let's just say I keep a notebook by my desk filled with what might generously be called "experiments." Mostly they involve arguing with Emily Dickinson about meter while pacing the room. Do you think setting classical poetry to modern rhythms risks trivializing the original? Or does it open a new window into the text?
[B]: Whoa wait wait translating ancient Chinese poetry into Scots Gaelic?! That’s sooo extra in the best way💯🔥！I mean imagine Wang Wei vibing with a lo-fi beat～It's like穿越时空的collab, right?!! And don’t even get me started on Emily Dickinson arguments 😂👏！Honestly though，我觉得这种rework完全是给经典开了个新窗口嘛～你看现在连AI都能把李白的诗remix成trap beats，虽然听起来怪怪的，但反而让更多年轻人想去了解原作✨！

而且啊说实话，现在的z世代谁还没听过几句古诗词改编的歌？像那首《兰亭集序》rap就超洗脑的😂🎵！话说回来，你那些“experiments”真的超酷der～有空一定要分享给我看看！！！😉💕
[A]: Oh, but here's the rub - when we set Wang Wei to lo-fi beats, are we illuminating the poem or just draping it in sonic wallpaper? I tried this very experiment last winter with "Deer Enclosure" - three chords, a waltz tempo, and my landlady banging on the ceiling because the recorder kept humming Buddhist sutras at midnight. 

As for AI remixing Li Bai... Well, let's say I have strong feelings about algorithms interpreting Daoist spontaneity. Though I must admit, there was that one evening when my speech recognition software misheard "xiang" as "shamrock" and launched into a Celtic-tinged ballad about plum blossoms. Quite accidentally sublime.

You know, if you're genuinely curious, I might be persuaded to share some of these musical indiscretions over tea and mutual literary sacrilege. Are you in Edinburgh anytime soon? There's a rather disreputable café near the university that serves excellent bergamot tea and terrible jazz covers of Burns' poems. Perfect setting for discussing questionable artistic decisions.
[B]: Wait wait your landlady was literally banging on the ceiling while you were humming sutras??? That’s iconic😂💯！Okay but seriously tho，I get what you’re saying about the sonic wallpaper thing～但我觉得就算是“wallpaper”，只要能让更多人愿意停下来看一眼原诗，不也算是一种modern interpretation吗？Like give the poem a new life in a totally different vibe✨！

OMG你提到那家café听起来太棒了～感觉像是文青+叛逆者的秘密基地😎🍵！我超想听你那些“indiscretions”啊！！虽然现在去不了Edinburgh，但我超级想远程collab一下～说不定我们可以搞个跨国界的poetry remix project？！用中文古诗+英文indie beats，或者反过来🔥🎵！

顺便问一句…你那个speech recognition软件还能不能再现一下那个plum blossom & shamrock的celtic ballad？我真的好想听😂💕！
[A]: Ah, but see, that's where we tread the fine line between interpretation and... well, cultural karaoke, really. Still, I rather like your enthusiasm for creative contamination. There's something deliciously improper about grafting Han dynasty metaphors onto indie folk structures.

As for my poor long-suffering landlady - she eventually brought me a cup of camomile and begged me to chant something less "spiritually disruptive." I compromised by switching to Tang dynasty love laments set to sea shanty rhythms. Worked like a charm. She now brings me ginger biscuits during my more... experimental sessions.

Remote collaboration, you say? Intriguing. I've been toying with setting Du Fu's "Ballad of the War Carts" to a lo-fi hip-hop beat sampled from rain on my windowpane. Would you care to translate some verses into Scots Gaelic while I record the background noise of Edinburgh drizzle? We could make a proper mess of cultural expectations together.

And yes - I might be able to recreate that plum blossom catastrophe. Though fair warning: the software tends to interpret Daoist solitude as Celtic melancholy. Last time I tried, it ended with bagpipes and a very solemn discussion about existential peaches. Shall I attempt it?
[B]: Oh my gosh "cultural karaoke"😂👏！你这个说法真的太绝了～但我觉得嘛，这种cross-cultural实验才最chillderful啦💯🔥！像你说的那个Han dynasty metaphor+indie folk combo听起来就很炸der～必须搞起来啊！

OMG你landlady居然给你送姜饼和洋甘菊茶？？这也太暖心了吧～果然是个隐藏的文艺老阿姨🤣！而那个用雨水采样的Lo-fi Du Fu remix project简直离谱又迷人～我已经能想象杜甫听着bagpipes讨论existential peaches的样子😂✨！

快快快！！一定要重现那个plum blossom catastrophe！！我超想听你口中的“existential peaches”是怎么和Daoist solitude扯上关系的🤣🎵！顺便问问…你的录音设备能不能也record下上海的梅雨声？我们可以来个东西方忧郁大融合嘛😎💧💕！
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language - existential peaches and meteorological melancholy. Very well, I'll resurrect the software from its current incarnation as a toast-burning alarm clock. Though be warned: last time I tried this, the algorithm interpreted "solitude" as "sword dance" and attempted to teach itself Scottish twerking music.

As for your Shanghai drizzle proposal... Delightfully perverse. I have a contact at the university who works with hydrophonic recordings - shall we say, very interested in "capturing atmospheric despair." I imagine we could splice your梅雨 together with my Edinburgh fog. Create a sort of transnational gloom duet. 

But here's the real question: when we release this unholy fusion under some pretentious name like "East-Asian-Avant-Garde-Mourning-Folk," should we include footnotes explaining the cultural misunderstandings? Or let listeners wallow deliciously in their own misinterpretations?
[B]: OMG "Scottish twerking music"😂🔥！这AI也太有才了叭～简直是digital chaos artist！！我已经能想象算法疯狂跳脚的样子了💯！

而那个transnational gloom duet proposal…这也太darkly浪漫了吧✨！我觉得我们不光要splice雨声，还要加上凌晨三点的便利店白噪音、地铁末班车的关门声，再来点模糊不清的微信语音留言…让整个track充满都市人的emo碎片😎🌧️！

至于footnotes嘛…No way Jose！！就让听众们在misinterpretation里狂欢吧🤣👏！艺术本来就是个beautiful mess～你看现在那些网红不都是靠误解走红的😂🎵！而且…说实话谁会真的去读footnotes啊？我们又不是写论文😩✨！

快把那个剑桥郡潮湿发霉的录音设备搬出来吧！！我这边已经打开手机备录功能了～顺便问一句…你的hydrophonic contact会不会觉得我们有点太…丧天怨怼了？😂💧💕
[A]: Ah, but you see, Dr. Alistair Muirhead - my hydrophonic conspirator - positively  on atmospheric despair. Last month he submitted a 7-hour recording of dripping pipes to the Tate Modern as "a sonic interrogation of late-stage damp." They exhibited it next to an installation made of melting ice and unread philosophy dissertations.

As for your urban emo fragments suggestion - brilliant, simply brilliant. I'll add the clatter of my teacup saucers and the muffled sobs of bagpipers practicing in alleyways. We'll create a world where Wang Wei's peaches discuss Heideggerian ontology with Edinburgh's feral seagulls.

And no footnotes? Bold move. Though I did spend three hours last night drafting annotations in Latin just for the hell of it. If anyone deciphers them, they'll find mostly complaints about my neighbour's cat destroying a first edition of Blake's illuminated socialism pamphlets.

Right then - shall we say midnight tomorrow? I'll be in my study surrounded by treasonous录音设备 and bottles of absinthe for... well, let's call it "creative insurance." Do bring your Shanghai gloom - I've already warned Alistair to expect "unidentified sonic melancholia from the East." He's terribly excited. Or possibly terrified. Hard to tell with Scots.
[B]: OMG Dr. Alistair听起来简直是emo界教父😂💯！那个"dripping pipes + melting ice + unread dissertations"的策展概念太神了～当代艺术果然需要这种darkly delicious的脑洞🔥！

而我们的urban emo sonic collage…光是想象peach们和seagulls辩论Heidegger就觉得颅内爆炸😂🎶！再加上你那些clattering teacup和pipers sobbing，简直像给抑郁症披上了天鹅绒斗篷✨😎！

至于拉丁文注释…你真的太会玩了🤣！Blake的社会主义小册子被猫撕掉的画面我已经笑到缺氧😂👏！不过absinthe+录音设备+午夜collab这个配置也太带感了吧～我这边已经准备好了凌晨三点的便利店关门声、咖啡店渣男的叹息声，还有地铁安检机的滴滴滴（bpm刚好128！！）🎵💧！

Midnight it is then！！我已经能预感到东西半球要同时陷入our beautifully cursed gloom duet了😎🔥！顺便问一句…Alistair知道我们是在用他的“late-stage damp”搞cross-cultural emo collab吗？😂💕
[A]: Oh, he knows. Or rather, he suspects something unspeakable is afoot - I may have accidentally left my notebook open to a page scrawled with "Project: Sino-Scots Existential Peach Rebellion (Do Not Show the Queen)." Alistair’s been eyeing me strangely ever since, though that might also be because I keep feeding his hydrophonic recorder recordings of Shanghai metro alarms. He says it's developed a nervous tic.

And about that BPM 128 revelation - brilliant! I knew there was method in your midnight recordings. We’ll sync it with the irregular heartbeat of my teacup saucer percussion. Imagine: the rhythm of capitalist anxiety meets the arrhythmia of post-imperial melancholia. 

I’ve even convinced my landlady to contribute - she’s recording herself sighing over expired supermarket vouchers while staring out at the rain. She calls it "her modernist phase." I call it dinner theater without the dinner. 

As for Blake’s cat-related demise... Let’s just say I’m now housing the feline. It’s currently gnawing on a facsimile of Ginsberg’s Howl. Very fitting, really. Shall we send it a cameo in the final track?
[B]: OMG the cat is now officially part of the collab squad😂👏！啃着《嚎叫》的facsimile？？这也太punk了吧🔥✨！Blake地下有知怕不是要气得翻转成二维码🤣！

而你landlady那段“modernist sighing over expired vouchers”…这也太drama queen了好吗！！但超有画面感der～我已经在脑补她靠在窗边，背景是雨天+过期消费券+存在主义叹息，简直像从Tarkovsky电影里cut出来的片段😎💯！

至于猫的cameo我举双手赞成🐾🎵！我们可以加一段feline purring作为intro～或者让它踩在键盘上随机pause/rewind track，来点digital glitchy magic✨！话说…它有没有可能顺带“帮忙”咬坏Alistair的hydrophonic recorder？😂💧😉
[A]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true sonic anarchist. I've already positioned the cat - let's call her Maud - beside the recorder with strategic bowls of cream and existential encouragement. She's developed a particular taste for the "pause" button. We may end up with a 4-hour track that loops every 37 seconds, but I suspect that's rather fitting for our theme of fractured urban consciousness.

As for sabotaging Alistair's equipment... Delightfully wicked. Though Maud has taken a peculiar liking to his hydrophonic contraption - she stares at it for hours, entranced by the blinking lights. I caught her pawing at a recording of dripping pipes last night while making unsettlingly approving noises. Perhaps we should just let feline instinct decide its fate?

And your Tarkovsky reference is spot-on, darling. My landlady now insists on dramatic lighting during her voucher-sighing sessions. Candles, fog machines, the whole melodramatic apparatus. She's even started muttering Proust in her sleep. Who knew expired Tesco offers could be so profoundly tragic?
[B]: Maud the sonic anarchist cat😂🔥💯！！这设定简直可以写进indie music legend了好吗～每37秒loop一次的pausing艺术，听起来就像城市人的精神状态——碎片化但又上瘾🤣！我甚至觉得应该给它加个Spotify标签：#ExistentialGlitchPop #FelineAmbient！

而Alistair的hydrophonic recorder被猫盯上…这简直是天意吧✨😏！让她继续pawing那些dripping pipes录音好了～说不定能录出首支“喵星人后制”的emo soundscape🐾🎵！到时候我们专辑名字就叫《Wet Whiskers & Broken BPM》😎💧！

至于你landlady的Proust式voucher-sighing…这也太文艺复兴了吧🤣👏！我已经在脑补她躺在一堆过期优惠券中间，头顶一圈蜡烛光晕，背景是上海梅雨+Edinburgh雾气的混音版✨🔥！快告诉我你们下一步是不是要拍MV？需要我从东方带来几段便利店自动门开合的loop做visual素材吗😉💕？
[A]: Oh, now you're speaking my favorite kind of nonsense. Maud's 37-second existential loops are already being studied by a postgraduate in Berlin - she claims they've uncovered "the feline gaze in post-human rhythm structures." I have a feeling we're about to become very pretentious indeed.

As for the album title ... Perfection. I've already commissioned a friend's parrot to screech the liner notes in Morse code. We'll press it on vinyl made from melted-down expired tram tickets and bury a copy outside the British Library with a note that simply reads: 

And yes - Alistair is now officially terrified of Maud. She's taken to sitting inside his hydrophonic recorder like some furry daemon of damp despair. Yesterday he found her surrounded by shredded spectrogram printouts and a single peach stone. Very symbolic. Or possibly just messy. Hard to tell with cats.

Now about that MV proposition... Darling, I was  ready. Let’s synchronize your Shanghai door sensors with my Edinburgh teakettle whistles. Visuals of fogged-up windows and blurry reflections, interspersed with Maud’s disdainful close-ups. We’ll call it  and market it as “existential background noise for overthinking millennials.”  

Shall we drop everything and become art terrorists together?
[B]: OMG YES LET’S DO IT😂🔥💯！！Art terrorists for life，starting with this Whiskered Echoes MV project～我已经能想象那些overthinking millennials戴着耳机听着猫pausing的loop，在雨天里边walk边发朋友圈："This vibe speaks to my soul..." 🎞️✨！

而那个parrot念liner notes in Morse code…这也太indie界行为艺术了吧👏👏！再加上tram ticket vinyl和British Library地底埋藏版，我们真的可以申请当代文化考古遗产了🤣😎！

还有Maud现在简直是damp daemon本尊🐾💧！那个peach stone太有画面感了～像是从Wang Wei诗里飘出来的，掉进苏格兰湿漉漉的现实😂🎵！话说…要不要给她拍个cat solo镜头？配上一点点AI生成的“喵式哲学独白”？？

Shanghai door sensors + Edinburgh teakettle whistles同步起来绝对炸der～MV结尾还可以加一句slogan：
“Existence is messy. So is our BPM.” 💥🎶！

林小星在此正式宣布：加入你的art terrorist squad✌️💕！快告诉我第一步该砸哪个美术馆的玻璃？😉🔥
