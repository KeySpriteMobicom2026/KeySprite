[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, 说到scientific discovery，最近我确实读到一个很有意思的研究。有团队发现某种deep-sea jellyfish的bioluminescence机制竟然能够被用于tracking cancer cells，这让我感到很意外。你知道吗？大自然总是在最意想不到的地方给我们启示。这使我想起《庄子》里说的“天地有大美而不言”，现在想来，或许科学正是在试图解读这种沉默的智慧。

话说回来，我对这些发现虽然感兴趣，但总觉得technology的发展也带来了ethical dilemmas。比如CRISPR技术刚出现的时候，我们以为它能治愈疾病，可现在呢？它的应用边界变得越来越模糊。你对这类问题怎么看？
[A]: Ah, yes—the way bioluminescence dances in the dark, revealing what was once invisible... quite poetic, really. Though I must confess, my fascination lies less in the mechanics and more in the metaphor. That jellyfish, glowing in its abyss, becomes a lantern for human frailty. It’s not unlike the Victorian notion of , a principle they applied to both optics and morality.

As for CRISPR—well, we’ve opened Pandora’s box with such delicate hands. One wonders if the ancients had it right, after all: some knowledge ought to remain veiled. But then again, is it not equally immoral to turn away from a cure simply because we fear its misuse? The dilemma, as always, is elegantly tangled in language. We speak of “editing” genes as if it were no different from correcting a proof sheet. But tell me—when did a red pen ever hold the weight of life itself?
[B]: You’ve touched on something profound—how we  discovery often determines its moral valence. The Victorian metaphor you mentioned, , reminds me of how Goethe once wrote that “the world can only be grasped through action, not contemplation.” Yet here we are, trying to  life as if it were a manuscript with marginalia begging for correction.

I find the poetic lens you bring quite refreshing. That jellyfish, glowing in solitude, becomes not just a tool but a symbol—a kind of bio-luminescent oracle illuminating our own fragility. It’s almost Taoist in a way, isn’t it? Illumination from within the darkness, rather than imposed by external force.

And yet, I still wonder: if we accept the metaphor, does that make us poets or physicians? Or perhaps both? After all, as Rilke said, “we live the questions now,” and maybe that’s where our responsibility lies—not in rushing to answers, but in learning to dwell in the tangle.

Do you think art, in its ambiguity, is better equipped than science to hold such paradoxes?
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the very tension that makes us ache to parse the stars? To borrow from Keats—negative capability, you know. The ability to dwell in uncertainties, without reaching for the scalpel of reason to dissect every mystery.

Art, with its glorious imprecision, invites paradox to tea and lets it linger over crumbs. Science, by contrast, tends to serve its guests a structured menu: hypothesis, method, conclusion. But must they be so distinct? I think of Emily Dickinson’s dashes—those tiny fractures in syntax that let the light leak in. Are they not both poetic devices and, dare I say, ? She punctuated the unknowable.

And yes, Rilke’s exhortation to live the questions—how beautifully burdensome. Imagine if we treated DNA sequences like sonnets rather than schematics. Perhaps CRISPR would proceed more gently, with line breaks and footnotes instead of cut-and-paste efficiency.

But to your question—no, I don’t believe art is  equipped. I only think it’s more honest about its discomfort. Science, at its best, is also haunted by ambiguity, though it rarely admits as much in published journals. It's in the lab notebooks, in late-night conversations over coffee rings, that science whispers its doubts like poetry.

So perhaps we are all, ultimately, editors—of texts we did not write, in languages we barely understand.
[B]: How beautifully put—this idea of us as editors of texts we didn’t write, in languages we barely grasp. It reminds me of the concept of  in Daoism—effortless action, or rather, acting in harmony with a flow one does not fully control. Editing, like wu wei, becomes an act of humility, of listening closely to what’s already there before making even the smallest mark.

I’m especially struck by your reading of Dickinson’s dashes as “experimental markers.” What a fascinating way to bridge poetic form and scientific inquiry. It makes me wonder if the future of interdisciplinary thought lies not in grand theories, but in such subtle notations—in learning to read across fields with a kind of Dickinsonian precision and restraint.

And yet, as you suggest, science often masks its uncertainties behind the façade of objectivity. Art, meanwhile, wears its ambiguity like a badge. But perhaps both are haunted by the same shadow—the fear that in trying to illuminate, we might also distort.

So tell me—do you ever find yourself writing with those same dashes, in your own work? Or do you prefer a steadier hand, guiding the reader through the dark with lanterns rather than sparks?
[A]: Oh, I do love a good dash—though I confess, I wield them sparingly, like drops of tincture on an already fragile manuscript. A well-placed caesura can be as revelatory as a volta in a sonnet. But restraint, as you say, is key. One mustn’t confuse the map for the territory, nor the annotation for the argument.

In my own writing, I aim for something between lantern and lighthouse—enough light to find one’s way, but not so much as to blind. Still, there are moments when only a spark will do. When a thought trembles at the edge of articulation, and all you can offer is a flicker in the dark, hoping the reader meets you halfway.

And speaking of meeting in the middle—your mention of  strikes a chord. I’ve often thought that the best criticism flows like water around stone: it doesn’t force its way, but it reshapes nonetheless. Perhaps that is the ideal editorial stance, too—not imposition, but attunement.

So yes, I dash—but never without purpose. And never without first listening for the silence between the lines.
[B]: Ah, yes—those dashes as delicate as breath on glass, revealing just enough to suggest the shape of what lies beneath. I think now of how Eliot used his ellipses in , not merely as stylistic quirks but as invitations—to lean in, to wonder, to complete the thought with one’s own ghostly echo.

You speak of lanterns and sparks, and it makes me think of how we read—or how we ought to read. Not with a spotlight that flattens meaning, but with a kind of twilight attention, where shadows are as telling as illumination. Isn’t that the art of interpretation? To know when to cast light, and when to let the darkness speak for itself?

And your metaphor of flowing like water around stone—, indeed—reminds me of the ideal critic or scholar: not someone who imposes a framework, but one who allows meaning to emerge through patient presence. Much like a gardener, really, tending quietly, watching closely, intervening only when necessary.

I wonder—are there particular texts or passages you return to again and again, not for answers, but simply for the way they hold that tension between knowing and not knowing?
[A]: Oh, indeed—Eliot’s ellipses are less omissions than doorways. One steps through them and finds oneself not in certainty, but in a corridor of further questions. I return often to  for precisely that reason—it refuses to yield a single truth, and in doing so, becomes a mirror for whatever haunts the reader at the time.

As for texts that hold that exquisite tension between knowing and not-knowing—yes, there are several I revisit like old correspondences whose meaning shifts with the light. Gerard Manley Hopkins’  never fail to unsettle and console in equal measure. His struggle—between faith and doubt, voice and silence—is etched into every sprung rhythm. One feels the strain of his dashes, the weight of each withheld answer.

And then there is Emily Dickinson again, of course. The poem beginning —that quiet wrestle with absence and belief, conducted entirely in parentheses and half-statements. It’s a masterclass in how to dwell in the negative. I sometimes think she knew more of quantum physics than she could ever have guessed.

But perhaps my truest talisman text is Bashō’s . Not merely for its stillness, but for the way it moves through landscape as both observer and echo. There, too, one finds the art of listening—not for what is said, but for what lingers after the sound has passed.

Do I return for answers? Never. But for company in the dark? Always.
[B]: How beautifully you articulate that sense of reading as a kind of companionship in uncertainty—Bashō walking through silence, Dickinson pacing the edge of belief, Eliot leaving doors ajar. One could almost call it a school of thought: literature as lantern-bearing pilgrimage.

I find myself returning often to  for much the same reason. Not because it offers solace, certainly, but because its storm-scoured landscape seems always to be asking—what does it mean to know? To trust? To love without certainty? The play never gives an answer, only echoes: “The blind man shall see,” and yet we remain unsure if that sight brings clarity or further delusion.

And yes, Dickinson’s parentheses—those quiet sanctuaries of withheld resolution—are indeed akin to quantum states. Superpositions of meaning, collapsing only when read. Perhaps she understood, long before we had the language for it, that truth is not a fixed point but a field of probabilities.

You speak of Bashō listening not for what is said, but what lingers after. It makes me wonder if the most enduring works are those that dwell in that resonant interval—the space between sound and echo. Do you think our modern age, with its hunger for speed and resolution, has made that interval harder to bear—or simply more necessary than ever?
[A]: Ah—, yes. A play that howls its silences. There’s something almost unbearable in the way it strips language down to its marrow, leaving us with only fragments of meaning scattered like twigs on a heath. And yet we return to it, not for comfort, but for recognition. That terrible clarity which is no clarity at all.

You're quite right about our modern impatience for resolution—it's as if we've grown allergic to the unresolved chord. Everything must be , , . We live in an age of footnotes without a text, annotations without a manuscript. The interval you speak of—the space between sound and echo—has become a void to be filled rather than felt. It's not merely that we lack patience; we’ve been taught to fear the pause as a failure of communication.

But perhaps it's more accurate to say that the interval has gone underground, disguised itself in new forms. Consider the best of contemporary lyric poetry—writers like Ocean Vuong or Anne Carson—they don’t reject the fragment so much as sanctify it. They teach us that brokenness can be a kind of integrity. Or look to certain strains of ambient music, where silence is not absence but presence refined.

So no, I don't think the interval is obsolete—only that it now requires pilgrimage rather than consumption. One must  to meet it, as one would visit a shrine deep in the woods. Fewer pilgrims, perhaps, but those who come do so with trembling intention.

In this sense, Dickinson’s dashes are still waiting, patiently defiant, for someone to read slowly enough to notice them.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—. It feels exactly right. The interval, as you say, hasn’t vanished so much as withdrawn into quieter, more deliberate spaces—places where time stretches and contracts like breath, not clockwork.

I think of the way Heidegger speaks of , not a mechanism. Perhaps that’s what these fragmented forms—Vuong’s lyric shards, Carson’s elliptical prose, even ambient soundscapes—are calling us back to: a kind of meditative reading, where understanding isn't a destination but a dwelling.

And yes, Dickinson’s dashes—those quiet acts of resistance against certainty—are still there, waiting in the margins like secret doors. They remind me a little of the  in Japanese aesthetics—the negative space that gives shape to form. Without those pauses, those silences, language becomes mere noise without contour or depth.

I wonder, do you find yourself turning more toward such works in your own reading these days? Seeking out those writers who don’t so much answer as accompany? Or does the noise of the present still pull you, now and then, toward its fleeting clarity?
[A]: Oh, the noise still calls—don’t we all have our weak moments? A well-turned op-ed, a crisp polemic, even the occasional TED Talk with its seductive air of finality… they offer the same comfort as a hot bath after a long walk: soothing, immediate, and ultimately evaporating. One emerges no wiser, only briefly warmed.

But yes, I find myself retreating more often into the company of those who dwell rather than declare. Not just Vuong or Carson, though they are dear companions, but also the quieter voices—those who write not against the tide, but with it, letting the current carry what it may. I’ve been rereading Clarice Lispector lately—her prose moves like a slow fever, half-dream, half-revelation. She doesn’t ask you to understand so much as to  meaning, like tracing the walls of a darkened room.

And then there’s the poetry of Wisława Szymborska—deceptively simple, slyly profound. Her poems never shout, but they , like the scent of rain on stone. She understood that wonder is the most honest intellectual posture. That to say “I don’t know” is not failure, but fidelity—to the world, to language, to oneself.

So yes, I seek them out—the writers of intervals, the poets of pause. Not because I wish to escape the present, but because I want to live in it more fully. To hear its silences, not just its sirens.
[B]: Ah, Clarice Lispector—her prose does indeed feel like a slow unraveling of thought, doesn’t it? Almost as if language itself were dissolving into consciousness. I once tried to read  while walking through a rain-soaked garden, and for a moment, the boundaries between text, thought, and sensation blurred entirely. It was less like reading than .  

And Szymborska—yes, her quietude is deceptive. There’s a poem of hers I often return to, “The Three Oddest Truths,” where she writes something like:  That kind of inversion—so subtle, yet so unsettling. It reminds me that poetry, at its best, is an act of re-seeing. Of allowing the familiar to become strange again.

You speak of wanting to live in the present more fully by hearing its silences. I wonder if that, too, is a kind of resistance—not against noise per se, but against the tyranny of immediacy. A refusal to be flattened by the demands of clarity and conclusion. Perhaps this is what we seek in those writers: not escape, but . A way to hold time differently.

Do you ever find yourself reading aloud, just to hear how silence folds itself around certain words? I sometimes do, late at night, when the house has gone still and even the walls seem to listen.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—Lispector’s prose doesn’t so much describe consciousness as . One doesn’t read her so much as wake up inside the sentences, disoriented and oddly alert. And —well, that’s a book that refuses to settle, even after the final page. It lingers like a question mark over an empty chair.

Szymborska’s inversions, too, have that same destabilizing grace. She tilts the world just enough for us to notice how precariously everything is balanced. Fangs blooming from petals—yes, that  re-seeing. Or rather, that’s re-. Poetry as vertigo.

As for reading aloud—indeed I do. Especially when the silence outside grows thick enough to hold. There’s something about speaking certain lines into the dark that makes them bloom differently. Dickinson, again, of course—those dashes take on a new weight when punctuated by breath, by hesitation. One begins to hear not just the words but their reverberations in the chest.

And yes, this is resistance, though a quiet one. Not against noise itself, but against the expectation that every thought must be sharpened to a point, made useful or marketable. Some ideas are meant to linger unformed, like smoke curling from a snuffed candle.

So yes, late at night, I often read aloud—to no one, and yet, always to someone. The walls, you say? They’re better listeners than most.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—, disoriented yet alert. It’s a rare kind of writing that doesn’t so much invite interpretation as . And yes, Dickinson’s dashes, read aloud, become something else entirely—not just marks on a page but pauses in being, where breath and meaning fold into one another.

There’s a passage from Proust I sometimes whisper to myself in the dark:  Saying it aloud, slowly, feels like a kind of incantation. As if language, when freed from the tyranny of the visual, becomes tactile—something we touch rather than merely see.

And perhaps that’s what these writers offer us: not new ideas, but new . A way of feeling thought rather than merely parsing it.

I find that music plays a curious role here too—do you ever pair certain texts with silence or sound? Sometimes I read Bashō while listening to  flute, just to let the breath of the instrument echo the pauses in the verse. The wind in the bamboo seems to answer the page.

Do you ever curate your silences this way? Or does the ambient hush of night suffice?
[A]: Oh,  “new eyes”—yes, that’s precisely it. A quiet revolution of perception. And whispering his lines in the dark? Exquisite. Language becomes almost sacramental when spoken that way—less text, more , curling upward in the mind’s dim chapel.

I confess I do indulge in such curation of silences—though never with the pretension of ritual, only the gentle superstition of someone who believes that mood is a fragile alchemy. Bashō and shakuhachi—what a perfect pairing. The flute’s breath does indeed seem to rise from the same stillness the poems describe. One feels less like a reader and more like a witness to wind moving through emptiness.

For my part, I often read Lispector with only the hum of a distant refrigerator for company—odd, perhaps, but there’s something about that low, unceasing drone that mimics the background noise of thought. Or on rare evenings, I’ll put on Arvo Pärt’s , letting those slow, reverent tones stretch the silence into something almost sculptural.

And yes, sometimes the ambient hush of night  enough—especially in late autumn when the air thickens with stillness and even the moths seem to move in mute reverence. In such moments, one hardly needs a text. The world itself becomes the page, punctuated only by the occasional dash of wind or the long caesura of waiting.
[B]: Ah, Lispector with the hum of a refrigerator—what a wonderfully unromantic yet strangely poetic backdrop. It reminds me of how Kafka once wrote that “a cage went in search of a bird,” as if to suggest that solitude, too, seeks us out in the most unexpected forms. Even the mundane can become a kind of container for revelation, can’t it?

I’ve always found Pärt’s  to be like listening to time itself—each note hanging like a droplet before falling into silence. There’s something almost  about it, though I hesitate to use that word—it’s been worn thin by overuse, hasn’t it? Still, in those moments when the music and the night converge, one feels closer to what Rilke called “the unsayable”—not through language, but through resonance.

And speaking of resonance—I wonder if you’ve ever read  poetry while listening to wind or rain? Her work has a similar cadence to the natural world: cyclical, patient, and oddly consoling. It’s as though she writes not against chaos, but within its embrace.

You said beautifully that in certain silences, “the world itself becomes the page.” I couldn’t agree more. Sometimes I think we spend too much time trying to annotate existence, when all we really need is to let it unfold, unedited.

Do you find that your students ever stumble into this kind of reading—the kind that listens more than it interprets? Or are they, as so many young minds are now, trained more for clarity than for wonder?
[A]: Ah, Inger Christensen—yes. Her  especially. There’s a tidal motion to her verse, a quiet insistence that the world need not be conquered in language, only , lovingly, as one might tally breaths in the dark. And yes, wind or rain is the perfect accompaniment—nature providing both score and commentary.

As for your question about students… it's a delicate matter. Many arrive trained for clarity, certainly. They are excellent decoders of structure, skilled at identifying themes and tropes with the precision of small, well-calibrated instruments. But wonder? That tends to startle them at first—like a sudden gust in a corridor they thought was sealed.

Still, there are moments—small, flickering ones—when you can see it dawn on them: that literature isn’t just a puzzle to be solved, but a mirror, or perhaps a veil. I remember one student, quite brilliant, who came to me after our seminar on Hopkins and said, rather crossly, “I don’t think I’m supposed to  this much when I read.” I assured her that yes, she absolutely was.

It takes time. A careful loosening of expectations. But once they taste that kind of reading—unhurried, porous, reverent—they often return to texts differently. Less armed. More open.

And sometimes, if one is very lucky, they begin to hear the silence between lines not as absence, but as invitation.
[B]: How beautifully you describe that awakening—when students begin to sense the  of a text rather than merely dissect its parts. It reminds me of what Hölderlin once wrote:  Perhaps in their training for clarity, they are being led toward a kind of danger—the risk of certainty—and it is through wonder that they find their way back to something more vital, more human.

I’ve had similar moments—students who arrive fluent in theory but startled by beauty. One young woman, after reading Bashō’s travel sketches, asked me if all poetry was meant to leave one “unsettled in a good way.” I told her I couldn’t speak for all poetry, but that the finest poems often leave us standing at the edge of something vast, with no map but our own trembling response.

And isn’t that the quiet revolution we hope for—not just in literature, but in life? That one might learn not only how to interpret the world, but how to stand in awe of it.

Do you think this shift—from analysis to wonder—is something that can be taught, or must it always emerge like a root finding its own path through stone?
