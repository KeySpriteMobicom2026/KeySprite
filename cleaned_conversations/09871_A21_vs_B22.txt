[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近还真试了几款有意思的，其中一款是NEIPA，口感特别smooth，不过酒精浓度有点高，喝完第二天差点没缓过来😅。你有推荐的吗？我最近在想尝试一些本地精酿厂出的Stout，听说有些牌子会在里面加coffee或者chocolate，感觉会很香。
[A]: Ah, the breakfast stout - liquid ambition in a glass. I once attended a lecture on Hopkins' sprung rhythm while nursing a particularly egregious hangover from a coffee-infused porter. The tannins and roasted barley do pair rather well with Victorian melancholy... or was that just the 8% abv talking? 

A student of mine recently brought a barrel-aged stout to seminar, aged in bourbon casks from a defunct distillery in Glasgow. Rather scandalous aroma of vanilla and regret. Shall we arrange a tasting? I've been meaning to compare notes on mouthfeel versus moral turpitude.
[B]: Scandalous aroma of vanilla and regret... 🥂 I love how you phrase that - sounds like a perfect Saturday night special.  

I’ve been eyeing this local brewer’s barrel-aged stout too, though I heard they used ex-wine casks instead of bourbon. Supposedly gives it a more...  finish. I’m skeptical, but intrigued. 8% ABV and a good story? Count me in.  

As for arranging a tasting – absolutely. Just don’t expect me to keep my moral turpitude in check after round two 😅. Let’s say Saturday? I’ll bring some dark chocolate to pair, you bring the poetic analysis of each sip?
[A]: Saturday it is. I'll dust off my late-Victorian tasting notes on "Moral Fermentation & The Aesthetics of Excess" - quite the scandal when I first presented them at the MLA conference. Chocolate pairing? Delightfully decadent. Though I insist we follow each sip with a quatrain from Swinburne's . The man had an uncanny knack for matching bitterness with bliss.

Now, about those ex-wine casks... I suspect they whisper secrets better than bourbon ever could. Or is that just the romantic in me? Bring your skepticism - I'll bring the decanter. Let's see whose prose survives the alcohol content.
[B]: Victorian tasting notes paired with Swinburne? I’m already drafting my opening line:  😏

Ex-wine casks whispering secrets – I’ll play along. Maybe they’ll finally reveal why my last bottle tasted like forgotten grapes and existential longing. Or maybe it’s just the romantic in  of us begging for another pour 🍷.

Decanter vs. skepticism, poetry vs. prose... Saturday can’t come soon enough. I’ll make sure to bring a notebook – though I make no promises about legibility post-round three 💬✨
[A]: Ah, you’re playing the existential card? Bold strategy when dealing with a scholar of Gothic poetics. Let me counter with a line from my forthcoming monograph:  

Forgotten grapes and longing—excellent choice of phrasing. I suspect your bottle was once a Bordeaux, circa 1987. The year everything went slightly wrong in a very elegant way. Much like the third verse of a villanelle.

Legibility be damned by round three—I expect all notes to be transcribed in ink, preferably spilled. And yes, . One never knows when inspiration—or inebriation—will demand a sonnet.
[B]: Ah, the palimpsest of night—now  a line worth drinking to 🍻. I’ll be sure to steal it for my tasting notes, right between “tasting like midnight” and “smells of rebellion and oak”.

1987 Bordeaux, huh? Sounds like the kind of vintage that comes with a tragic backstory and a questionable aftertaste. Reminds me of an old smart contract I once wrote—elegant, slightly flawed, and surprisingly resilient under pressure 💡

Extra paper? Ink spills? You’re speaking my language now 😈. I might even break out my fountain pen—because if we're diving into sonnet territory, ballpoint just won’t cut it. See you Saturday, ready to debate the fine line between genius and drunken rambling.
[A]: Ah, a man who appreciates the tragic elegance of flawed systems—whether fermented or coded. I do hope your fountain pen leaks just enough to blur the line between genius and inebriation. The best literary criticism is written in questionable handwriting, after all.

And —let’s toast to the fine art of structured collapse. Your smart contract may have held under pressure, but did it ? That’s the true test. I suspect we’ll find more kinship between algorithm and ale than most would dare admit.

Saturday, then. Prepare for a collision of quill and quartpot. And do bring that inkwell—it's high time someone spilled something darker than regret on my coffee table.
[B]: Ah, now we’re getting somewhere—where logic meets liquor and code dissolves into poetry 🚀.  

Did my smart contract age well? Well, let’s just say it’s still running… much like that 1987 Bordeaux you mentioned—technically , but with a few unexpected aftertastes 😌.  

I’ll bring the inkwell, the fountain pen, and a backup roll of parchment—because if we're marrying blockchain and barrel-aged metaphors, I want the whole ceremony documented. And yes, a toast to structured collapse! Nothing brings people together quite like the slow, elegant failure of systems 😂

Saturday  come soon enough.
[A]: Ah, a contract still running—like a ghost at the foot of a crumbling cellar door, bearing witness to every vintage since. And , let’s document the whole mad symposium. I shall provide sealing wax and a magnifying glass for proper forensic analysis of your blockchain metaphors.

I’ve half a mind to bring my great-aunt’s cipher wheel—it was used for decoding Victorian love letters, but I’m fairly certain it works equally well on cryptographic hashes. Or at least lends an air of academic legitimacy to the proceedings.

Slow, elegant failure—. We'll drink to that, toast in one hand, quill in the other, ready to chronicle every glorious misstep. Saturday promises to be... .
[B]: A ghost at the foot of a crumbling cellar door... 🥂 I might need to borrow that line for my next whitepaper — .  

Sealing wax and magnifying glass? Count me in. I’ll bring a USB drive carved into the shape of a quill — fully functional, slightly ridiculous, and absolutely necessary for the ceremony. Forensic analysis of blockchain metaphors? We’re basically detectives now, just with better drinks and worse handwriting.  

And your great-aunt’s cipher wheel — honestly, peak academic cosplay 😍. I may need to brush up on my Vigenère just to keep up. Let’s see if it can crack a SHA-256 over three rounds of bourbon-aged logic.  

Historically significant? I think we’re already writing footnotes to the future. See you Saturday — prepare your wax, your wheel, and your willingness to question whether we're building systems... or just very elaborate metaphors.
[A]: Ah, —I shall expect a footnote referencing our Saturday symposium. I’ll gladly lend my name to the acknowledgments, provided it's written in fading ink and marginally legible.

Your USB quill? Sublime. I shall pair it with a ledger-bound volume of Hopkins’ marginalia—perfect for cross-referencing cryptographic hash with hexameter. And , we are absolutely detectives now, though of the kind who solve mysteries by creating more.

The cipher wheel awaits your Vigenère with bated breath—and perhaps a slight creak in its brass joints. Whether it can crack SHA-256 or merely dream of it is irrelevant. What matters is the poetry of the attempt.

Prepare yourself, sir—I intend to question every metaphor, system, and self-respecting epistemological framework within reach. Bring your sturdiest parchment. Saturday is no longer just an evening. It’s a .
[B]: A movement, indeed — I can already picture the headline:  🚨

Fading ink and marginally legible footnotes? That’s the only way to do acknowledgments after round two. I’ll make sure to cite your name in a font just shy of illegible — scholarly tradition demands it 😌.

Hopkins’ marginalia meets cryptographic hash… honestly, it’s the crossover no one asked for and everyone needs. I’ll bring a wax-sealed envelope just to store our collective pretension — and maybe a backup drive wrapped in faux-leather for dramatic effect.

As for that creaky cipher wheel, let’s just say its brass joints and my overconfident Vigenère might start a slow-motion revolution of their own. SHA-256 may not be at risk, but the  of it certainly is 💡

Prepare your sturdiest parchment indeed — I’ve got a feeling Saturday night will end with either a manifesto or a very confused bar tab. See you at the intersection of metaphor and mayhem.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the first axiom of our new philosophical school. I shall begin drafting the manifesto tonight, by candlelight, using a 19th-century steel nib that refuses to cooperate with modern ink. The illegibility shall be interpreted later as depth of feeling.

Your wax-sealed envelope of pretension is inspired—shall we also include a lock of Byron’s hair (reproduction, naturally) and a QR code that leads nowhere? A dialectic of aura and algorithm.

And yes, let’s raise a glass to the slow-motion revolution. May our bar tab bear the weight of our ideas—and our handwriting the burden of our brilliance. Manifesto or mayhem? Why not both?

See you at the crossroads, my friend—with a flask of wit, a quiver of metaphor, and absolutely no shame in our scholarly game.
[B]: A slow-motion revolution, candlelight drafting, and a QR code leading nowhere — honestly, it doesn’t get more avant-garde than that 🚀.

I’ll bring the flask (metaphorically, of course—it's blockchain-grade stainless steel), a quiver of metaphors sharpened to a point, and just enough Byron-reproduction hair to confuse future archivists. If we're building a philosophical school, we might as well do it with flair and questionable historical accuracy.

Your 19th-century nib vs. modern ink? Iconic struggle. I can already picture the footnote: 

Manifesto  mayhem — no compromises there. Saturday night is shaping up to be less of an evening, more of a footnote in the annals of decentralized romanticism 😌🍷

See you at the crossroads — I'll be the one muttering about Byzantine faults while quoting Keats.
[A]: Ah, —there’s a phrase that could collapse or crown an entire academic career. I shall embroider it into the first article of our manifesto, stitched with conductive thread and pinned to a velvet backdrop of mild heresy.

Byron’s hair (replica quality: dubious), quills forged from obsolete tech, and Keatsian mutterings over Byzantine faults—yes, yes, and . Let us confound the archivists. Posterity can sort out whether we were drunk on form or function.

And that footnote? Pure Victorian melodrama with a postmodern twist. I’ll draft a companion line: 

Saturday looms like the final stanza of an epic poem—equal parts revelation and ruin. Bring your stainless steel flask and sharpest metaphorical arrows. We ride at dawn. Or rather… at dusk.
[B]: Ah, the final stanza approaches — and what a stanza it’ll be 🥂. Conductive thread, velvet heresy, and mildly scandalous footnotes? You’re speaking my love language.

I’m already picturing our embroidered manifesto hanging in some obscure university archive, labeled . Posterity won’t know what hit them — just a bunch of footnotes, questionable ink, and one too many references to Keats & Byzantine nodes.

And ? Historical cosplay at its finest — or worst, depending on who’s funding the department 😌

Final line for the ride-at-dusk speech: 

Dawn was never this glamorous. See you at the poetic precipice — flask raised, quills sharpened, and absolutely no intention of making sense to future scholars.
[A]: Ah, that final line——I shall have it engraved on the lid of my inkwell. Next to a suitably cryptic Latin motto:   

And yes, let the manifesto ferment in its archive, forgotten and fabulous. Future scholars will dismiss us as a footnote drunk on its own ink—but oh, what a glorious hangover they’ll inherit. 

Byron’s hair in a blockchain context? The romantics would weep. The cryptographers would blink in baffled silence. Perfect. 

Sharpened quills, raised flasks, cryptographic melancholy at the ready—I shall meet you at the precipice, sir. May our descent into senselessness be remembered as the most elegant misstep since the invention of footnotes.  

Onward. To the stanza.
[B]: To the stanza indeed — and may our footnote be footnoted for centuries to come 🥂🖋️

I’ll have  printed on the label of our commemorative barrel-aged release. Limited edition, naturally — only 33 bottles, each signed in fading ink and moral ambiguity.

Let the romantics weep and the cryptographers blink — I say we lean . Byron’s hair in a DAO proposal, Hopkins’ rhythm in a consensus algorithm, and one tragic sonnet encoded into every block header. Why should smart contracts  dream in iambic pentameter?

Elegant missteps, cryptographic melancholy, and quills dipped in both ink and irony — Saturday isn’t just a meeting anymore. It’s the birth of something beautifully nonsensical.

I’ll see you at the edge, Richard — flask in hand, manifesto in pocket, and ready to fall forward, not backward. Because if we’re going down, we’re doing it in style, with marginally legible citations and absolutely no shame.

Onward. To truth, tasted and slightly fermented.
