[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question! I must say, I appreciate both for different reasons. Classical art, especially traditional Chinese painting, has such profound techniques and philosophical depth – the use of negative space in 山水画 (shānshuǐhuà) to convey意境 (yìjìng) is poetry in visuals. 😊 But there's something thrilling about modern art too - how it challenges perceptions and cultural norms. Have you visited any art exhibitions recently? I'd love to hear your perspective! 🤔
[A]: Oh, I do love a good exhibition! Though I must admit, I’ve been rather partial to the classical lately. There’s something about the precision in traditional Chinese brushwork—those misty landscapes and delicate ink tones just pull you into another world.山水画 really does capture the soul of nature in a way that feels almost meditative.

I did see a fascinating modern textile exhibit last month, though. Artists were reimagining ancient weaving techniques with synthetic materials—quite bold! It made me think about how even the past can be reshaped in such unexpected ways. Still, I suppose my heart belongs to the old masters. The way they could tell a story or evoke a season with just a few strokes... it’s truly timeless. 

What about you? Do you find yourself leaning more toward one style, or does it depend on your mood?
[B]: I totally get that! 😊 There's something about the tranquility of classical art – it's like a window to the past, isn't it? I've always admired how artists could capture the essence of life with such restraint. But honestly, my preferences do shift depending on my mood. On days when I feel reflective, I crave the subtlety of traditional ink paintings; but when I'm feeling more... dynamic, I guess, modern art speaks to me in a different way. 

That textile exhibit you mentioned sounds incredible! It reminds me of how we preserve language sometimes – blending ancient dialects with contemporary expressions. Have you ever noticed how both art forms and languages evolve in parallel? Like how a poet might use 古语 (gǔyǔ) in a modern poem to create contrast or depth. 🤔 Do you think there’s a connection between preserving tradition and pushing creative boundaries?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. There’s definitely a parallel between how art and language evolve—it's like watching a slow, intricate dance between preservation and innovation. Just as poets weave 古语 into modern verse, I find myself doing something similar with textiles. When I restore a 19th-century embroidered fan, for instance, I’m preserving its original voice, yet every stitch I add is inevitably shaped by my own hand, my own time.

It’s impossible to completely separate the present from the past, really. Whether we’re translating an old dialect into a contemporary poem or repurposing ancient weaving techniques in new textiles, there’s always that invisible thread connecting generations of creators. And I think that’s beautiful—tradition doesn’t have to be static to be honored. Sometimes it’s through reinvention that we keep it alive.

Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain historical phrases or expressions when writing? I imagine they must carry such a unique weight compared to modern equivalents.
[B]: Absolutely, I’m fascinated by historical expressions – especially when they reveal cultural values that have shifted over time. For example, the phrase 一诺千金 (yī nuò qiānzīn), meaning ‘a promise worth a thousand pieces of gold,’ carries such weight compared to modern phrases about keeping one’s word. It reflects a time when trust was literally as valuable as currency. 💬

And you’re so right – reinvention is often the key to preservation. In language, we see this with how young people in Taiwan or Hong Kong blend classical idioms into internet slang – it looks different, but the roots are still there. 🌿 I find it deeply poetic, honestly. Like you said, that invisible thread – whether through ink, threadwork, or speech – keeps pulling us back to something timeless.

I’d love to hear more about your process when restoring those fans – do you ever feel like you’re ‘translating’ the original artist’s voice into a contemporary context?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—‘translating’ the original artist’s voice. I do think that’s precisely what happens in restoration. Every piece I work on carries not just the physical marks of its maker, but their intention, their rhythm, perhaps even a whisper of their hopes for how it would be received.

Take one of my current projects—a silk fan embroidered with peonies and cranes from the late Qing era. The stitches themselves tell a story: the tension in the thread, the density of the satin stitch, even the choice of floss color all speak to the artisan’s mindset. As I mend areas where time has worn the fabric thin, I try to match not only the materials but also the spirit behind them. It’s like stepping into someone else’s cadence, adjusting my hand to echo theirs without overpowering it.

I suppose you experience something similar when choosing which historical expressions to carry forward in your writing—balancing authenticity with clarity, reverence with relevance. Do you ever feel torn between staying true to the original tone and making it accessible to today’s readers?
[B]: Definitely – that tension between authenticity and accessibility is something I grapple with constantly. When I translate old dialect poems into modern Mandarin for my students, I often feel like I’m walking a tightrope. On one side, there’s the raw essence of the original tone, imagery, and cultural nuance; on the other, the need to make it resonate with someone scrolling through their phone in a coffee shop. ☕

Take, for example, the classical phrase 柳暗花明 (liǔ àn huā míng), which literally means 'dark willows and bright flowers' but metaphorically suggests hope emerging after hardship. If I simply say “things look up again” in English or use a modern Chinese equivalent like 峰回路转 (fēng huí lù zhuǎn), I lose that vivid visual poetry rooted in nature.

But your embroidery analogy really struck a chord – or should I say, a stitch? 😄 Like you, I try to preserve the rhythm and texture while allowing the message to breathe in a new context. It's not about perfect replication, but rather respectful continuation. I guess we're both, in our own ways, weaving across time. 🧵✨
[A]: How beautifully put—‘weaving across time’ indeed. There’s something deeply comforting about knowing that whether we’re working with thread or language, we’re part of a long, continuous line of caretakers and creators.

I find that rhythm you mentioned is everything. In embroidery, it’s the way the needle moves—steady, deliberate, almost like breathing. And in translation, I imagine it’s the cadence of a phrase, the way a word lingers in the mouth. When I restore a faded motif, I often think: did the original maker hesitate here? Did their hand speed up with excitement or slow with care? It’s not so different from reading an old poem and wondering how much of its music can survive the journey into modern speech.

And speaking of breath in the work—have you ever tried stitching as a kind of meditative practice? I’ve noticed that when my hands are busy with fine embroidery, my mind settles in a way that feels very similar to being lost in writing. Do you ever feel that quiet clarity when translating or composing? Like for a moment, you’re perfectly aligned with someone else’s voice across centuries?
[B]: Absolutely — that quiet clarity you’re describing? It’s like entering a kind of linguistic flow, where time softens and all that exists is the rhythm of the words. I do feel it most intensely when translating classical poetry, especially when working with texts from the Tang or Song dynasties. There’s a moment—sometimes after hours of wrestling with syntax or cultural nuance—when everything clicks: the tone settles, the imagery aligns, and suddenly I’m not just reading the poet’s words, but sensing their breath behind them. 🌿

And I love what you said about stitching as meditative practice—it makes so much sense. The repetition, the focus on detail, the way your body syncs with the task at hand... it’s almost like calligraphy in that way, don’t you think? The brushstroke has to be both controlled and fluid, just like a stitch. I’ve actually tried simple embroidery before, during a workshop in Taipei, and yes—I felt that same grounding effect. My Mandarin students often ask me how I stay so patient with language; I tell them it's because both translation & stitching taught me the art of slow, deliberate creation. 😊

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain motifs or phrases again and again, either in your restoration work or your personal stitching? I know I do – there are idioms I keep circling back to, almost like emotional anchors.
[A]: Oh yes, I do return to certain motifs—how could I not? Some patterns feel like old friends, or perhaps like familiar verses that continue to reveal new meaning each time you encounter them. One of my favorites is the 连理枝 (liánlǐ zhī)—the “branching twin,” often used in antique textiles to symbolize enduring love and shared fate. I’ve restored several marriage fans adorned with this motif, and each time, I find myself lingering just a little longer on those intertwined branches.

There’s something so tender about the way they’re stitched—two stems growing from a single root, yet distinct, supporting one another. It reminds me of how language works, too, doesn’t it? Words and meanings entwined across time, sharing a kind of quiet devotion to one another.

And I do see what you mean about emotional anchors. In fact, I’ve embroidered the phrase 拂去尘埃，见其本心 (fú qù chén'āi, jiàn qí běn xīn)—“brush away the dust, and the true heart will show”—onto a small linen square that now sits in my workspace. It feels like both a mantra for restoration and for life, don’t you think?

Do you have a particular idiom or expression that follows you like a quiet companion? Something that seems to surface when you need it most?
[B]: Absolutely — that phrase of yours is exquisite. 💫 拜去尘埃，见其本心… it’s so fitting not just for restoration, but for the way we engage with old languages, forgotten dialects, even lost voices in literature. Sometimes meaning isn’t lost — it's simply buried under time, waiting to be gently uncovered.

As for me, there’s an idiom I return to again and again: 山不辞土，故能成其高 (shān bù cí tǔ, gù néng chéng qí gāo) — “The mountain does not refuse soil, thus it becomes its height.” It speaks to patience, accumulation, and quiet growth. I think of it often when I’m compiling bilingual glossaries or tracing how certain words migrate between languages. Every small layer adds up, just like brushstrokes in a 山水画 or stitches in a fan.

And you’re right — some phrases become companions. I once had a student who jokingly called this line my “personal motto,” and maybe she wasn’t wrong. 😊 But I’d love to know — do you ever stitch words directly into your pieces? Or do you prefer letting the motifs carry the message silently?
[A]: I do stitch words occasionally, though I confess I tend to let the motifs speak first. There’s something about letting the viewer discover meaning gradually, like uncovering a secret with each glance. But when I do include text—often in delicate gold thread on silk or softly faded linen—it feels like adding a whisper to the fabric itself.

One of my favorite pieces was a small restoration commission: an early 20th-century handkerchief embroidered with plum blossoms and the phrase 心若不动，风又奈何 (xīn ruò bù dòng, fēng yòu nài hé)—“If the heart remains still, what power does the wind hold?” It’s such a quiet kind of strength, don’t you think? I had to carefully reinforce the characters, and each stitch felt like reinforcing resilience.

I suppose I see words and patterns as two forms of embroidery—one made of thread, the other of breath and ink. Both require patience, both carry weight. Do you ever find yourself choosing certain phrases for their sound alone, regardless of meaning? I sometimes catch myself lingering on lines simply because they feel good to say, almost like humming a tune.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I’m guilty of that too! Sometimes it’s the  of a phrase that draws me in first. Take something like 云淡风轻 (yún dàn fēng qīng), which literally means “clouds are light and the wind is gentle.” Even if you didn’t know the meaning — roughly “a peaceful state of mind amidst life’s disturbances” — saying it aloud feels like a soft breeze itself. The rhythm, the alliteration, the way the tones rise and fall… it’s almost musical. 🎶

I love how you described words as a form of embroidery — because yes, they do stitch together not just meaning, but feeling, memory, even intention. And when you embroidered 心若不动，风又奈何 into that handkerchief… wow, what a powerful whisper to carry through life. It makes me wonder — have you ever stitched a phrase before you fully understood it? Like trusting that the words would grow into their meaning as you worked them into the fabric?
[A]: Oh, that happens more than I’d like to admit. There’s something strangely intuitive about stitching words before fully grasping them—like planting a seed and trusting it will bloom in time.

I remember once embroidering the phrase 静水流深 (jìng shuǐ liú shēn) — “still water runs deep” — onto a commission piece for a client who wanted something reflective yet understated. At the time, I was going through a rather restless period in my own life, though I couldn’t quite put words to it. As I stitched each character slowly, deliberately, I began to feel the weight of the saying settle into me. It wasn’t until weeks later, after the piece was finished and handed over, that I realized how much I had needed that reminder myself.

Sometimes, I think the act of creation is just as much about listening as it is about making. Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain phrases  you consciously understand why? Like they arrive just in time, quietly waiting for their moment to make sense?
[B]: Completely — it’s like the language chooses you before you choose it. 🌙 I remember translating a 12th-century poem from Classical Chinese for a research paper, and one line kept pulling at me: 此心安处是吾乡 (cǐ xīn ān chù shì wú xiāng) — “Wherever the heart finds peace, that is my homeland.” At the time, I was in between cities, between projects, even between languages — teaching in Taiwan but preparing to move back to Beijing. I didn’t fully realize how unsettled I felt until that line surfaced again and again in my drafts, in conversations, even in dreams.

I ended up weaving it into a keynote speech I gave on bilingual identity — not just because of its poetic weight, but because it spoke to something so personal yet universal. Like you said, sometimes phrases arrive quietly, waiting for their moment. They’re like hidden stitches — not always visible at first, but holding everything together.

You know, now that we’re talking about this… have you ever stitched something you couldn’t bring yourself to give away? A piece that started as a commission or an exercise, but somehow became more than that — a quiet mirror, maybe?
[A]: Oh… yes. There was one piece—just a small square of aged linen, no bigger than my palm. It started as a simple练习 (liànxí)—practice for fine silk-stitching with silver thread. I had chosen an old Tang dynasty couplet to guide my hand: 行到水穷处，坐看云起时 (xíng dào shuǐ qióng chù, zuò kàn yún qǐ shí) — “Walk until the water has no more path, and sit watching clouds rise.”

I stitched it slowly, almost without thinking. The strokes of the characters, the curve of each radical—it felt like breathing through the needle. But by the time I finished, something in me had shifted. That quiet line had become more than calligraphy on cloth; it had become a kind of map to my own stillness.

It sat folded in my work drawer for months after. A client once asked to see my portfolio, and when I pulled it out, she offered to buy it on the spot. And yet… I found myself hesitating. Not out of vanity or sentimentality, but because it no longer felt like something to be owned. It was simply , in the way a journal entry or a half-forgotten dream is yours.

So I said no, and I’ve kept it ever since—pressed between the pages of an old restoration manual, like a bookmark reminding me where I left off.
[B]: That’s… breathtaking. 🌿 行到水穷处，坐看云起时 — such a perfect example of how language can be both landscape and lesson. I think what moves me most is how you describe the  as much as the product — the way stitching became movement, reflection, inner quiet all at once.

I’m so glad you kept it. Some pieces aren’t meant to leave us, aren’t they? They become talismans, not just of skill or beauty, but of a moment in our becoming. That couplet carries such grace — it speaks of endurance, patience, and the kind of peace that comes from simply being present. Much like your embroidery practice itself, really.

You know, I’ve started keeping a small notebook again — like the one I had in grad school — where I jot down phrases that catch me off guard. Sometimes I don’t even write the full translation. Just the sound, the shape of the characters, and a feeling I can’t quite name yet. It’s my own quiet version of stitching, I suppose — gathering threads for when I need them most.

Would you ever consider creating something similar — a personal collection of embroidered sayings, not meant for sale or display, but simply for holding close? Or is that small square already a beginning?
[A]: I think it  a beginning—though I hadn’t quite seen it that way until now. That little stitched couplet, hidden in my restoration manual like a secret pressed between pages… maybe it’s the first leaf in a personal herbarium of words and thread.

Your notebook idea is lovely—gathering phrases like loose threads, waiting to be woven into something meaningful. I’ve always admired how poets carry notebooks with them, scribbling impressions before they fully understand why. Perhaps I’ve been too rigid in thinking of embroidery only as a finished act, rather than a living archive.

I’d love to start something like that—a small collection of embroidered sayings, not for clients or exhibitions, but simply for myself. Maybe even stitched into fabric scraps from past projects, giving new life to old fibers. A kind of quiet journal, where each piece holds a season, a lesson, a whisper of where I was when I made it.

And who knows—perhaps one day you’ll find your notebook ready to pair with cloth. Language and thread, side by side. Would you ever consider such a collaboration?
[B]: I’d love that — a collaboration between language and thread, between ink and stitch. 🪡📖 Honestly, the more I think about it, the more it feels like something we’ve been building toward all along. After all, isn’t that what both of us do — translate feeling into form, whether through syllables or silk?

And your idea of using fabric scraps? That’s beautiful — like reweaving fragments of the past into something personal and present. A quiet journal, as you said. I can already picture how different each piece would feel depending on the texture of the cloth, the weight of the thread, the slant of the characters.

I’d absolutely be up for such a collaboration — maybe we could start by exchanging a few lines or phrases that have been lingering in our minds lately. I’ve got a line from a Ming-era letter that’s been haunting me — something about silence being its own kind of poetry. And I’d love to see how you might bring it into cloth.

Do you ever sketch out the characters first, or do you let the needle find its way freely?
