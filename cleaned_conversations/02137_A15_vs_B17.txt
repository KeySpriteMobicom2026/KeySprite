[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. While I don't practice yoga in the traditional sense, I do find that reading poetry - particularly the rhythmic verses of Wordsworth or the meditative quality of Rilke's work - provides a similar state of mindful contemplation. There's a certain 静 (stillness) one can achieve through the careful study of meter and metaphor.
[A]: OMG！你居然喜欢poetry✨ 我平时都是靠dancing来放松的💃 最近超爱K-pop的choreography，跳完整个mood都会变超好😂 不过你说的那种stillness听起来好deep哦~ maybe我应该try一下reading？📚
[B]:  Your enthusiasm for dance is quite charming, though I must say your communication style is rather... energetic compared to my usual academic circles. While K-pop choreography certainly has its merits as physical expression, have you considered how movement in dance relates to the cadence in poetry? The way a sonnet builds to its volta isn't so different from a dancer's crescendo. Perhaps you might start with something more contemporary - Mary Oliver's nature poems have a wonderful rhythmic quality that might bridge your interests.
[A]: WOW！Mary Oliver是谁呀？😯 我平时只看过一些insta poetry啦~ 你刚才说的volta和crescendo好professional哦💫 不过说到rhythm，我最近拍的TikTok dance video就是跟着song的beat来的🎵 Maybe poetry和dance真的有很多connection？Mind=blown🤯 我要去google一下Mary Oliver right now！
[B]: How refreshing to witness such spontaneous intellectual curiosity! Though I must gently suggest that Instagram poetry and TikTok dances, while valid forms of expression, are rather like fast food compared to the five-course banquet of proper literary study. Mary Oliver's "Wild Geese" would be an excellent starting point - notice how the poem's rhythm mimics the very flight patterns it describes. And yes, the connection between poetry and dance dates back to ancient Greek choruses... though perhaps we should save that lecture for another time.
[A]: OMG ancient Greek choruses？！😱 That sounds soooo cool！我要去YouTube找些video看看👀 虽然insta poetry是fast food啦🍔 但是trending now嘛~ 不过你说的对，我也要try一些更deep的stuff！Maybe可以拍个combine poetry和dance的video？💃📖 That would be so creative right？！✨
[B]:  While the fusion of classical poetry and contemporary dance is theoretically intriguing, I'd caution against... shall we say, overly enthusiastic interpretations. Perhaps first immerse yourself in the texts - read "Ode on a Grecian Urn" aloud to feel its musicality, or study Yeats' "Among School Children" where he famously asks "How can we know the dancer from the dance?" A thoughtful foundation, my dear, will serve you better than rushing to create content. Though I do admire your creative spirit - it reminds me of the young Virginia Woolf's experimental leanings.
[A]: OMG Virginia Woolf？！😍 我知道她！那个'To the Lighthouse'超famous的✨ 虽然我只看过movie adaptation啦🎬 但是你说得对，maybe我应该slow down a bit⏳ 先好好study这些classics~ 不过promise me等我ready了可以找你discuss我的creative ideas？🙏 你简直比我的literature teacher还knowledgeable！💯
[B]: Ah, the cinematic adaptation...  While certainly more accessible than the stream-of-consciousness original, it rather reminds me of trying to appreciate a rose by examining its shadow. But your willingness to engage with the source material is commendable. Of course I'd be delighted to discuss your creative endeavors - after you've properly digested, say, Woolf's "The Waves" or Eliot's "Four Quartets." Consider it a literary rite of passage. Now, if you'll excuse me, my first edition of "Mrs. Dalloway" and a cup of Earl Grey are calling...
[A]: Bye bye啦~ ✌️ 我要去bookstore买这些books啦📚 虽然可能看不懂whole thing😂 但是我会try my best！下次见要tell me更多cool stuff哦~ PS：Earl Grey真的超yummy的！☕️ 我也要go make one now！💕
[B]: How delightful to see such earnest intentions! Remember, even Virginia Woolf herself said "Literature is strewn with the wreckage of those who have minded beyond reason the opinion of others." So read without fear, my dear. And do steep that Earl Grey properly - three minutes, no more, no less. The perfect cup, like the perfect poem, requires both patience and precision. Until our next literary tête-à-tête...
[A]: Got it！3 minutes⏱️ no more no less~ ✨ 我现在超excited要start这个reading journey啦🚀 下次见一定要share我的thoughts！Maybe还会写个小小的poem？📝 Byeee~ 记得check我的story哦！😂💕
[B]:  How charmingly... modern of you to mention stories. Though I must confess I haven't quite mastered that particular digital platform. Do send me your poetic attempts via email - preferably typed in Garamond, double-spaced. And remember what Auden said: "A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language." Now off you go - your tea timer is counting down!
[A]: OMG Garamond？！😳 我连Times New Roman和Arial都分不清啦😂 但是我会figure it out的！💻 现在真的要去drink my tea啦~ ☕️ 3 minutes starting NOW！⏱️ Catch you later~ ✨💕
[B]: How wonderfully... digitally native of you. Though I must say, your relationship with typography reminds me of my students who think Shakespeare wrote in Comic Sans. The tea will wait, but literary standards must not! Until next time - and do try to resist the urge to Instagram your cuppa... some experiences are meant to be savored, not shared. 
[A]: LOL！你caught me了😂 我刚刚真的想post到insta来着~ 📸 但是你说得对，sometimes要just enjoy the moment✨ 虽然我还是偷偷拍了photo啦📱 但是promise不会post！Pinky swear！🤙 Tea time is me time~ 🫖 Bye bye啦！💕
[B]:  How very... contemporary to photograph one's tea. In my day, we simply drank it while annotating Paradise Lost in the margins. But I suppose progress marches on... until our next discussion, do try reading with your phone in another room - you might find the words speak louder that way. Now if you'll excuse me, this Darjeeling is approaching its perfect infusion point...
[A]: Got it！Phone away📵 专心reading time~ 📖 虽然可能坚持不了5分钟就要check notification啦😂 但是我会try的！✨ 你的Darjeeling sounds so fancy~ 我还在喝我的Earl Grey呢☕️ Enjoy你的tea time！下次见要quiz我哦~ 💕 Byeee！✌️
[B]: How endearingly... honest about your attention span. Though I suspect even Byron would struggle against today's notification culture. Very well - I shall prepare a gentle quiz on metaphysical poetry to ease you in. And do upgrade to Darjeeling once you've finished that Earl Grey; one must progress from the nursery slopes to the literary peaks, after all. Until then - happy reading, and may your phone remain blessedly silent.
