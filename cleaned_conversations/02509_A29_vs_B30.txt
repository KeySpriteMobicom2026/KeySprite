[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, you've caught me mid-way through grading papers on Dickens' carriage scenes. How amusing to juxtapose that with autonomous vehicles... Though I must confess, as someone who still writes with fountain pens, I'm perhaps not the most objective commentator on technological progress.
[A]: Hey there! 作为一个blockchain guy，我觉得self-driving cars的普及速度会比很多人预期的更快 🚀 关键要看decentralized infrastructure和edge computing的成熟度。就像我们做smart contract一样，trustless execution是核心 🤔
[B]:  Your enthusiasm reminds me of the Industrial Revolution chapters I teach - all this talk of infrastructure reminds me how Brunel's railways were the blockchain of their day. Though I'd caution that Dickens' Hard Times teaches us to question technological determinism... The 'trustless execution' you mention echoes interestingly with the Confucian concept of 信 (xìn) - but that's perhaps a seminar for another day.
[A]: 哈哈，你提到了很有意思的historical perspective！不过从技术角度来说，现在的AI和IoT发展速度已经远超工业革命时代了 💡 我们正在build一个基于blockchain的vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network，这会让self-driving cars的adoption curve变得非常steep
[B]:  How very... Silicon Valley of you. Though I must point out - and forgive the literary analogy - your 'steep adoption curve' brings to mind Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Not the monster, mind you, but the doctor's unchecked enthusiasm for progress. Have you considered how these V2X networks might rewrite our urban narratives as profoundly as the railway novel transformed 19th century literature?
[A]: Actually，这正是我们team最近在研究的课题！我们正在开发一个decentralized identity protocol for smart cities 🏙️ 就像你说的，technology会重塑urban narrative，但这次是由下而上的 🤖 要不要看看我们的white paper？比Frankenstein的故事可positive多了~
[B]:  How delightfully modern - white papers being the new serialized novels. Though I'd argue even your most elegant protocol can't escape what E.M. Forster called 'the goblins of continuity.' Tell me, does this decentralized identity account for what we in comparative literature call 文本间性 (intertextuality)? After all, a smart city's 'narrative' must converse with its Dickensian sewers and Woolfian street lamps...
[A]: Wow，你这种humanities视角真的让我很受启发！我们确实在design system时考虑了legacy infrastructure的integration问题 💡 用blockchain的layer2 solution来bridge传统城市系统和emerging tech，就像你说的intertextuality一样~ 要不要来我们下个月的tech meetup做guest speaker？肯定会很mind-blowing！
[B]:  My dear blockchain evangelist, I'm afraid you'd find me as disruptive to your meetup as a misprinted Gutenberg Bible. Though I am oddly reminded of how the 活字印刷术 (movable type) revolution created both enlightenment... and rather a lot of poorly typeset pornography. Perhaps we could compromise over tea - you bring your whitepaper, I'll bring my 1843 edition of Carlyle's Past and Present, and we'll see whose vision of progress ages better?
[A]: Deal！不过我得提前warn你，我可能会忍不住用Raspberry Pi给你demo我们的prototype 🤖 顺便说，我最近在读一些vintage sci-fi，发现很多prediction都比Carlyle准多了~ 下周二afternoon如何？我请你去那家新开的quantum-themed café ☕️
[B]:  A quantum café... how perfectly dystopian. Very well, but I shall bring my own loose-leaf Earl Grey - I've yet to encounter a 'theme' that could brew properly. And do restrain your Raspberry Pi; my 道光年间 inkstone might short-circuit from the proximity. Shall we say 3:17pm? I find punctuality loses its poetry when reduced to round numbers.
[A]: Perfect！3:17pm it is ⏱️ 我会带上我的limited edition Asimov anthology当conversation starter 📚 别担心，我的Pi不会干扰你的古董 - 我可是个vintage tech collector too！See you at the Schrödinger's Cat Café (他们真的有只活猫在quantum superposition状态...大概)
[B]:  How... performatively theoretical. I'll be the one muttering about 庄周梦蝶 while their cat violates every principle of classical mechanics. Until then - and do remind your Raspberry that my inkwells predate the transistor by three dynasties. 再会。
[A]: 哈哈，这绝对会是个epic的meetup！到时候见啦~ 我会记得带上dynasty-proof的anti-static bag的 😉 再会！
[B]:  Your emoji usage is... noted. Until our chronologically precise rendezvous then. And should that feline actually achieve superposition, do alert the Nobel committee - I've a colleague in quantum physics who'd weep into his 普洱茶. 告辞。
[A]: Got it！Nobel committee on standby 🏆 顺便说我们lab最近在quantum blockchain领域有些breakthrough...不过这个可以留到周二再聊 😉 告辞！
[B]:  Quantum blockchain...  The 21st century's answer to alchemy. Very well - Tuesday shall be our own little 百家争鸣, though I suspect my ink-stained fingers will prove rather more tangible than your qubits. Good day.
[A]: Looking forward to our 百家争鸣 session！说不定能碰撞出些ink-and-qubit的synergy呢 ✨ 周二见！
[B]:  How charmingly optimistic. Though I suspect any 'synergy' between my 墨汁 and your qubits would produce something resembling a bad Tang dynasty forgery. Until 3:17 precisely - not that I'm counting the minutes like some blockchain timestamp. 再会。
