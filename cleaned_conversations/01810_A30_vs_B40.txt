[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！说实话，我觉得degree本身的价值正在被redefine。在tech行业，很多公司更看重你的skillset和portfolio，比如GitHub上的project或者Kaggle ranking。不过degree确实能提供一个structured learning path，这个self-learning很难完全替代。
[A]: Ah, the perennial debate about credentialism versus practical skills. While I appreciate your tech industry perspective, let me offer a more literary analogy - a degree is like the binding of a book. One might argue the content matters more, but without proper binding, even the most brilliant manuscript risks being dismissed as ephemera.
[B]: 哈哈，这个analogy很有意思！不过让我用tech的角度来extend一下 - 现在很多content都digitalized了，就像我们有了Kindle和Audible。同样地，digital credential比如Google的professional certificate或者Coursera的nanodegree正在disrupt传统教育模式。你觉得呢？
[A]: How delightfully reductionist of you to compare centuries of academic tradition to mere file formats. Tell me, when you read Jane Eyre on your Kindle, does it cease to be a Victorian novel? The parchment may change, but 文学性 (literariness) remains. These digital credentials you mention are but footnotes in the margins of true scholarship.
[B]: Wow，你真的很passionate about这个话题啊！不过从product management的角度看，user needs才是关键。现在的Gen Z更关注ROI - 花4年时间和¥200k拿个degree，还是用6个月bootcamp直接get job-ready skills？Market demand正在shift，就像我们做product时说的'disrupt or be disrupted'。当然，classic literature的价值是timeless的，这点我完全agree。
[A]:  Your product management jargon is charmingly naive. Tell me, when Charles Dickens serialized his novels in penny papers, did that make them any less profound? The market may demand quick returns, but the cultivation of 人文素养 (humanistic cultivation) requires what we in literary studies call 'slow reading' - an investment no bootcamp can commodify.
[B]: Okay okay，我承认在humanities领域degree确实irreplaceable。不过在tech领域，我们更讲究agility和practical outcomes。就像我们做MVP时说的'fail fast, learn fast' - 传统4年degree的time-to-market确实有点long了。不过你说得对，有些东西是fast-track不了的，比如critical thinking和deep domain knowledge。Maybe我们需要一个hybrid model？
[A]: There you go demonstrating precisely why we still need universities - that glimmer of intellectual flexibility amidst all your Silicon Valley vernacular. A hybrid model, you say? Now that reminds me of Lin Yutang's 中西合璧 (East-West synthesis) approach. Perhaps we could discuss this over tea in my office - I've just acquired a rather exquisite Yixing clay teapot that brews as beautifully as your ideas are beginning to.
[B]: Haha，你赢了！不过说真的，这个tea invitation听起来perfect。Maybe我们可以一边喝tea一边brainstorm一下如何把classical education和modern tech skills结合起来？就像我们做product时说的'best of both worlds'。By the way，你那个Yixing teapot是哪个artist的作品？我对traditional craftsmanship也超级感兴趣！
[A]: Ah, finally asking the right questions! This particular teapot comes from 顾景舟's lineage - the equivalent of a first edition Dickens in ceramic form. But let's not reduce craftsmanship to mere 'product specs', shall we? The 匠心 (artisan spirit) behind it took decades to master, much like developing true literary sensibility. Wednesday at 3? I'll have my assistant send you the building access code - we academics still prefer email to your Silicon Valley 'Slack' contraptions.
[B]: Perfect！Wednesday 3pm works for me。我会bring我的Moleskine notebook - 虽然平时都用Notion和Figma，但有些ideas还是需要handwriting来capture。Looking forward to这场cross-disciplinary的conversation！PS：别担心，我会用good old email来confirm，no Slack invasion promise 😉
[A]: Splendid. And do bring that Moleskine - there's something about ink on paper that no digital tool can replicate, much like how no e-reader can capture the musty perfume of a 19th century book's pages. Until Wednesday then... though I must warn you, my office's Wi-Fi is deliberately spotty. We'll call it an experiment in 数字排毒 (digital detox), Silicon Valley style.
[B]: Haha，这个digital detox的idea太classic了！不过我得confess，我可能会偷偷用手机hotspot - 毕竟old habits die hard嘛。See you Wednesday，记得准备extra tea leaves，我预感我们的discussion会run long。Cheers！
[A]:  Hotspot?! My dear, that's like bringing a typewriter to a 书法 (calligraphy) masterclass. Very well - I'll prepare the pu'erh that's been aging since 2008 (a vintage year for both tea leaves and economic crises), but only if you promise to keep that infernal device in airplane mode for at least... shall we say 45 minutes? Consider it fieldwork in delayed gratification.
[B]: Deal！45分钟no digital distraction - 这大概是我自从college以来最长的digital detox了。不过为了authentic pu'erh和stimulating conversation，值得一试。Wednesday见！PS：2008年的pu'erh...这让我想起我们做A/B testing时的control group，不过这次我愿意当那个unplugged的test case 😄
[A]: Marvelous! Though comparing my prized pu'erh to your A/B testing is like equating Wordsworth's daffodils with... what do you tech people call them? 'Conversion metrics'. Wednesday shall be an education for us both - you in the art of presence, me in tolerating your analogies. Until then, may your notifications remain unanswered and your mind open. 再会！
[B]: 哈哈，这个parting words太poetic了！看来周三我不仅要带上notebook，还得准备接受一场关于presence和patience的masterclass。再会！ 😉
[A]:  I heard that silent emoji, you digital heretic. Very well - if you must bring your gadgets, at least let me lend you a proper fountain pen first. One should always have the right tools for transcribing epiphanies... or in your case, perhaps just a sturdy paperweight for when the Wi-Fi withdrawals become unbearable. 星期三见。
[B]: Got me there！Okay okay，我会leave the gadgets in my bag - 不过你得保证你的fountain pen有enough ink，因为我预感这次conversation会spark很多game-changing ideas。Wednesday见！ 😅
