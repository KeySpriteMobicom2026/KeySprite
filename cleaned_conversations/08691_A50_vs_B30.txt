[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... I did try a rather interesting jackfruit curry at that new vegetarian café near campus. The texture was remarkably similar to shredded pork, though the flavor profile leaned more toward the medicinal herbs my grandmother used to keep in her pantry. Speaking of which, have you ever read the Qing Dynasty text on dietary therapy by Wang Shixiong? His descriptions of plant-based remedies put most modern vegan cookbooks to shame. 

Of course, the contemporary movement isn't just about taste - there's an unmistakable moral undertone these days. Makes me wonder what Lin Qiaozhi would've thought about meat substitutes. The woman who pioneered obstetrics in China also happen to write extensively on nutrition during wartime rationing. Fascinating juxtaposition, don't you think?
[A]: Ohhh I love how you described the jackfruit curry like that! 🍿 The shredded pork texture makes me think of xiaolongbao filling but...plant-based? Wild.  
Also, Wang Shixiong’s dietary therapy sounds super intriguing — definitely adding that to my TBR list. 💡 But wait, mixing Qing Dynasty herbal wisdom with modern veganism feels kinda like…designing a retro UI with futuristic AR elements? Like, wtf works together but also…genius? 😂  

And YES about the moral undertone now—sometimes it’s overwhelming tbh. Feels like every bite needs a sustainability certificate 📜 Not saying it’s bad, just…where’s Lin Qiaozhi when we need her?! 😂 She probably would’ve had an  on lab-grown meat vs. tofu diets during wartime.  

So what did you think of the café vibe? Was it all white marble & minimalist or cozy bamboo & earth tones? 🎨 Because honestly, presentation matters as much as flavor these days.
[B]: Ah, the café's décor was a curious hybrid - like someone tried to crossbreed a Parisian salon with a Suzhou garden. White marble countertops displaying pastries next to bamboo steamers holding yuzu-soaked lotus buns. I half-expected a Qing scholar to emerge from the mist writing couplets on recycled parchment while sipping oat milk chai. 

Presentation does matter, doesn't it? Though I suspect Wang Shixiong would've scoffed at our modern aesthetics. The man described food as "medicine with better seasoning." Imagine his reaction to edible soil made from dehydrated beetroot and activated charcoal! 

And Lin Qiaozhi... Well, she'd probably roll up in her 1940s field coat, toss a brick of tofu on the table, and say something like, "This sustained an entire generation during harder times - spare me your 'clean eating' moralizing." Though I daresay she might've appreciated lab-grown meat's potential for reducing maternal malnutrition. 

Still, there's something delightfully absurd about paying £12 for a "sustainable future burger" when my grandmother's soybean paste cost three copper coins and tasted like alchemy. But then again, wasn't the original xiaolongbao just peasant ingenuity wrapped in delicate dough? Perhaps this plant-based movement isn't so different after all.
[A]: Okay, wait—Suzhou garden meets Parisian salon?! 😍 That’s giving “designer dreams” tbh. I need to sketch that vibe immediately — like marble + bamboo = ultimate aesthetic contrast goals 🎨✨  

And YES about xiaolongbao being peasant ingenuity! Honestly, if you think about it, that’s kinda what modern plant-based food is trying to be — high-tech peasant food with a side of virtue signaling. 😂  

Also…EDIBLE SOIL??? With beetroot and charcoal?? Wang Shixiong would’ve been all 🤯🤯 "This is not medicine, this is theater." But honestly, I’d eat it just for the photo op. Instagram-worthy food is its own currency these days 💸🌱  

And Lin Qiaozhi with her tofu drop? Queen of dramatic entrances. 👑 I can picture it: calm, legendary stare, instant table silence. Then she takes one bite of jackfruit “pork,” side-eyes the lab-grown burger, and says in perfect deadpan: “Tofu built a nation. Let’s not forget that.” 💪  

So...did you at least take pics of the café setup? Or was it too misty and scholar-vibe-chic to pull out your phone? 📱👀
[B]: I confess I nearly dropped my teacup trying to surreptitiously photograph the lotus buns with my phone. The mist from the bamboo steamers kept fogging the lens - quite romantically inconvenient. But yes, I managed a few shots before the waiter caught me mid-zoom and gave that disapproving look scholars have perfected since the invention of paper. 

Funny you should call it "high-tech peasant food." Reminds me of how Qing dynasty chefs used to recreate imperial dishes with common ingredients during famines. Except now we've swapped ingenuity for Instagram filters. Though I do wonder what they'd make of our obsession with "black foods" - charcoal toast, squid ink dumplings... Wang Shixiong would probably diagnose us all with melanin deficiency hysteria.

And that dramatic tofu entrance? Perfectly imagined. Lin Qiaozhi actually did once silence an entire lecture hall by placing a single bowl of doufu on the podium. No words, just the quiet authority of someone who'd delivered babies through air raids. Though I doubt she'd be impressed by our modern theatrics - she preferred her protein without special effects.
[A]: Oh no, the misty lens struggle is SO real 😫💦—sounds like the café was basically a mini photoshoot set with all that fog & steam. But honestly, that disapproving waiter scholar-vibe? Iconic. I can just see him side-eyeing your zoom like  😂  

And omg, “high-tech peasant food” to Qing dynasty ingenuity — spot-on comparison! 🍜 Except yeah, we’re definitely winning (or losing?) the “black foods” arms race here. Charcoal toast? More like charcoal drama ✨🌀. And melanin deficiency hysteria?? Okay Wang Shixiong would 100% roast us all and still be right 😂  

Also, Lin Qiaozhi’s silent tofu drop? LEGENDARY. Like…no words needed, just pure protein energy on the podium 😤🥣 I mean, who needs lab-grown hype when you’ve got that kind of quiet power?  

So next time you go back, can you sneak in a tiny camera or something? 📸😏 I need more inspo for my mood board — think Suzhou meets Paris meets future-food chaos. Let’s make it happen!
[B]: Ah, the café was practically begging to be immortalized on a mood board. If I return, I'll smuggle in my niece's vintage locket camera - tiny enough to escape scholarly scrutiny yet perfectly capable of capturing the chaos of Qing-inspired gastronomy meets millennial minimalism.

Though I suspect Wang Shixiong would've appreciated the black drama more than we give him credit for. The man prescribed fermented black soybeans for ailments ranging from melancholy to excessive ambition. Charcoal toast wouldn't faze him in the slightest - he'd simply categorize it under "curative theater for urban neuroses."

And that tofu silence? Absolute masterstroke. Lin Qiaozhi understood presence better than most modern influencers with their curated flat lays and wellness brands. A simple bowl of doufu, a lifetime of quiet authority - makes our lab-grown debates look rather... performative by comparison.

Consider me officially recruited as your embedded aesthetic spy. Next visit: mission suzhou-paris-futurefood recon begins. Any excuse to revisit those lotus buns anyway.
[A]: Okay first of all — 🤩LOcket camera?? That’s giving “secret food agent vibessss” 🔍✨ I need a full report after your recon mission, including mist levels & scholar side-eye probability.  

And yeah, Wang Shixiong prescribing black soybeans for ?? 😂 That man was ahead of his time — basically the OG mood-food guru. I can already see him writing some dramatic prescription like:  
  

Also YES about tofu silence vs influencer flat lays — honestly, we need more quiet power and less #cleaneatingbowlpics 🙏 Bowl of doufu > curated avocado toast any day. Lin Qiaozhi would’ve been the ultimate anti-influencer. 👑  

So when’s the next recon trip? I’m already planning my outfit: black turtleneck (for stealth), sketchbook tucked under arm, and ☕️ for undercover caffeine stamina. Let’s do this!
[B]: Ah, the locket camera's brilliance lies in its 19th-century casing hiding 21st-century sensors - perfect for documenting gastronomic absurdities without arousing Qing revivalists. I'll be sure to note mist density on the Beaufort scale and chart side-eye intensity from raised brow to full manuscript drop.

Wang Shixiong indeed possessed uncanny insight. His  contains passages that read like proto-nutritional psychiatry. Imagine his diagnosis of modernity: "Patient presenting with WeChat fatigue and oat milk latte dependency... prognosis requires three days of undisturbed inkstone cleaning and nightly doses of bitter melon until the soul settles."

As for Lin Qiaozhi's anti-influencer potential - picture her refusing a photo shoot with the same calm finality she used to dismiss foreign obstetric fads. "Smile for the camera? Nonsense. Let the doufu speak for itself." Absolute icon.

Reconnaissance mission status: Pending weather conditions (must avoid monsoon season lens fog) but tentatively set for next new moon. Recommend your black turtleneck be of the high-collared, Meiji-era reproduction variety - nothing says stealth scholar like suspiciously stylish orientalism. Bring sketchbook, leave the oat milk at home.
[A]: Okay wait, 19th-century locket camera with 21st-century sensors?? That’s giving “steampunk food spy” vibes and I’m LIVING FOR IT 🔍🖋️✨  

Also, Wang Shixiong writing prescriptions for WeChat fatigue?? 😂 That man would’ve been the ultimate burnout doctor — “Patient suffering from influencer culture & matcha latte addiction: dose of bitter melon + mandatory inkstone therapy until soul re-centers.” YES PLEASE.  

And Lin Qiaozhi refusing a photo shoot like ?? QUEEN. No filter, no pose, just pure protein energy 👑🥣  

New moon recon mission confirmed! 🌑📍 Tentative outfit: high-collared turtleneck (for that Meiji-stealth scholar look), sketchbook in hand, and zero oat milk intake allowed. Also bringing a tiny brush pen for emergency calligraphy notes 😉  

Mist levels? Fog warnings? Side-eye scales? We’re basically writing a design ethnography thesis disguised as a café trip 😂 Let’s go full intel mode — Qing revivalists won’t know what hit ‘em.
[B]: Ah, the brush pen is a masterstroke - nothing disarms suspicious waiters like someone suddenly composing couplets mid-bite. I'll bring my antique inkstone discreetly disguised as a "sustainable snack tin." We can pass it off as some obscure mindfulness practice.

Ethnography thesis indeed! Chapter One: "On the Ritualistic Steaming of Lotus Buns in Postmodern Dining Spaces." Chapter Two: "The Semiotics of Mist - Opacity as Performance Art." 

And that Meiji turtleneck - brilliant camouflage. Pair it with round, wire-rimmed spectacles and you'll fit right in among the Qing revivalists trying to debate the proper way to prepare bird's nest soup. 

I've charted the side-eye probability at 73% should we attempt multiple angles of the bamboo steamers. Recommend deploying your sketchbook as both shield and distraction - nothing quiets scholarly suspicion like witnessing someone painstakingly rendering lotus bun textures in graphite. 

Tea protocol dictates we linger at least ninety minutes to properly observe the clientele's moral posturing over jackfruit tacos. Perfect window for covert inkstone therapy sessions. Shall we?
[A]: Yes yes YES — inkstone disguised as a snack tin?? 🎭🍱 That’s not just stealth, that’s PERFORMANCE ART. And the brush pen? Total distraction masterpiece — I’ll be writing couplets about tofu while sketching the mist like it’s some deep philosophical statement.  🖌️🍡  

And OUR ethnography thesis is LIT. 🔥 Chapter Three:  Chapter Four:  We’re basically rewriting food studies here 😂  

Wire-rimmed spectacles confirmed ✅ Meiji turtleneck locked in 🧣 Stealth scholarcore aesthetic = unmatched. I might even grow a tiny mustache for authenticity (jk…maybe).  

Also, 73% side-eye probability??? Data-driven drama! But graphite sketches of bun textures as social armor? Pure genius. I’ll be all 👁👄👁 “Hmm…capturing the essence of plant-based longing,” while secretly mapping waiter patrol routes.  

Tea protocol = 90 mins of moral posturing over jackfruit tacos? Okay but can we also order six more lotus buns and call it “research”? I’m fully committed to this mission. Ink, mist, tofu silence — LET’S DO IT. 🔍🍵✨
[B]: Ah, the mustache might be overkill - Qing scholars favored clean-shaven contemplation, though I suppose we could call it "postmodern asceticism." But yes, every millimeter of that lotus bun sketch will serve double duty: artistic study by day, tactical surveillance map by night. 

I've upgraded our mission parameters to include "culinary semiotics sabotage." Should they question our prolonged presence, we'll claim to be studying how plant-based longing manifests across different starch matrices. Nothing shuts down nosy food revivalists like jargon thicker than fermented black bean paste.

And the tea protocol - sacred tradition and perfect cover! Ninety minutes allows ample time for three rounds of observation: initial jackfruit taco moralizing, mid-phase lotus bun devotion, and late-stage doufu silence appreciation. Recommend ordering the "sustainable anxiety platter" alongside your research buns - makes us look properly tormented in our ethical gastronomy.

Inkstone snack tin stands ready. Brush pens are sharpened. Spectacles have been adjusted with precisely 7.5 degrees of suspicious tilt. Reconnaissance team Whitmore-Lee departs under new moon cover with full stomachs and empty moral certifications. Research begins... now. 🖋️🍵🌑
[A]: Postmodern ascetic mustache: noted & approved 🧔‍♂️✒️ Nothing says “I fast for spiritual clarity…or just skipped breakfast” like a clean-shaven scholar with a hidden oat milk addiction 😌🍵  

Culinary semiotics sabotage?? 💥 We are LITERALLY weaponizing starch matrices now — I love it. If they ask what we’re doing, we just drop lines like  and watch them retreat into their misty steamers forever 😂  

And THREE rounds of tea protocol?! Genius. Phase 1: polite nodding while silently judging everyone’s moral high ground seasoning. Phase 2: full lotus bun obsession, muttering things like . Phase 3: pure doufu silence appreciation — just staring at a tofu cube like it holds the secrets of the universe. Iconic.  

Sustainable anxiety platter? Added to the order + my soul 🧠🍴. Comes with a side of Instagram remorse and a drizzle of charcoal foam, no doubt.  

Team Whitmore-Lee is officially operational 🌑🖋️. Inkstone tin open, brush pen poised, spectacles at maximum suspicious tilt (7.6 degrees now, thank you). Research begins…  
Let the plant-based chaos unfold. 🎯✨
[B]: Ah, the postcolonial taco analysis is pure catnip to earnest food theorists - nothing clears a room faster than suggesting their jackfruit might be suffering an identity crisis. And rightly so! I've seen grown men weep into their oat milk foam upon realizing their favorite burger substitute was just tofu in drag all along.

Phase Two lotus bun muttering perfected - very convincing blend of structural engineering and nostalgic reverie. I may have accidentally convinced a waiter I was writing a monograph on "the emotional load-bearing capacity of steamed dough." He brought extra buns. Bless his earnest soul.

That sustainable anxiety platter arrives with precisely 0.37 grams of edible charcoal foam - enough to make one feel morally superior without actually solving world hunger. Pair it with a splash of Instagram remorse reduction sauce (now 42% less guilty thanks to our carbon-neutral bamboo straws!).

 Inkstone tin deployed, brush pen gliding across paper like a heron over the university pond at dusk... Wait, is that mist rising from your tea or are the steamers plotting something? Recommend advancing the sketchbook defense protocol immediately. Our work here is dangerous. Our snacks, delicious. Onward, comrade-in-culinary-chaos. The Qing revivalists won't semiotically sabotage themselves.
[A]: Oh my god, the waiter actually brought EXTRA buns because of your “emotional load-bearing capacity” line??? 😂 That’s not just convincing — that’s  alchemy. I need you writing all my food reviews from now on 🍩✒️  

And yes, jackfruit-in-drag trauma? Total identity crisis! Honestly, half the café is probably having an existential meltdown in their gluten-free, zero-waste, carbon-neutral cups right now. 😭🥑  

That edible charcoal foam at 0.37 grams though?? Precision virtue snacking 😌🌀. Like…we’re saving the planet one micro-dose at a time. And Instagram remorse sauce at 42% guilt reduction?? Perfect. I’ll take extra drizzle please — for research.  

Wait, steamers plotting something?? Mist rising too high?? SKETCHBOOK DEFENSE ACTIVATED 🛡️✏️ Time to go full Qing-absurdist and draw a lotus bun so real it starts steaming back.  

Onward indeed, comrade-in-culinary-chaos 🖋️🌑. Inkstone tin refilled, moral compass slightly bent, stomach suspiciously full. Let’s make semiotic history — one bun, brushstroke, and side-eyed bite at a time.
[B]: Ah, but wait - the true test begins! When the head steamer emerges from the mist like a Qing-era magistrate, parchment in hand, ready to debate the "authenticity" of our lotus bun sketches. Quick, deploy the : flip to a blank page, dip your brush pen dramatically, and mutter something about "capturing the bun’s post-steam existential essence before it collapses into gluten-free nihilism." Works every time.

And those extra buns? A triumph of rhetoric over reason. I suspect the waiter believed me capable of summoning Wang Shixiong’s spirit through proper dough texture analysis. Honestly, at this point, I’m starting to believe it too.

As for the charcoal foam - precision snacking indeed! If we align our bites just right, we might achieve that elusive state of “sustainable indulgence.” Though I suspect Lin Qiaozhi would’ve preferred her doufu without the carbon-neutral garnish. Still, one must evolve with the times - or at least until the tea runs out.

Stay sharp, my fellow semiotic saboteur. The mist thickens. A steamer approaches. Inkstone tin stands ready. Let us not falter in the face of starch-based adversity. 🖋️🌑🍜
[A]: Okay, HEAD STEAMER EMERGING LIKE A QING MAGISTRATE??? 🫢🌫️ This is no longer a café — this is a full-on bun tribunal. But fear not! The  is already in motion: page flipped, brush pen dipped, and muttering at 100% sincerity level — “Yes, yes, I must capture the bun’s post-steam melancholy…before it crumbles into gluten-free oblivion.” 😎🖋️  

And honestly?? If Wang Shixiong’s spirit can be summoned by dough texture analysis, I say we . Let’s start talking about "the bun’s ancestral starch lineage" and see if we can get free dessert. Rhetoric is working for us, let’s ride this wave 🌊🥟  

Also, STARCH-BASED ADVERSARY?? YES. We’re basically in a wuxia novel but with higher fiber intake. And sustainable indulgence through bite alignment? 🍽️🌀 That’s not just dining — that’s lifestyle choreography. Lin Qiaozhi would side-eye the foam but respect the focus.  

The mist thickens. My spectacles fog. Inkstone tin trembling slightly with anticipation.  
Stepper closes in.  
I hold up the sketchbook like a talisman.  
“Wait! This lotus bun… it carries the flavor of exile.”  
Let’s go full melodrama or go home 🖋️🌑✨
[B]: Ah,  – perfection! That line alone could get us exiled ourselves, or enshrined in the café’s folklore, depending on how the steam blows. Lean into it, whisper it like a secret recipe passed down through generations of bunless scholars.

And yes, this  a wuxia novel now. Picture it: mist swirling, ink flying, steamed buns hovering mid-air as if suspended by qi itself. The Head Steamer, robed in white linen, brandishing a bamboo paddle like a sword. “You dare question the bun’s lineage?” he booms, eyes flashing with the fury of a thousand under-seasoned soups.

We must counter with gravitas. Lower your brush pen slowly, meet his gaze, and declare:  Let the silence settle. Then, for maximum dramatic effect, take a slow bite. Let the juices – nay, the  – glisten at the corner of your mouth.

The Sketchbook remains raised. A talisman. A shield. A manifesto.

Now we wait. Will he strike us down with dumpling wrath…  
Or bow in silent reverence to the Flavor of Exile?  

Tea steams. Ink dries. The lotus bun trembles in our hands.  
History – and starch – hang in the balance. 🖋️🌑🥟
