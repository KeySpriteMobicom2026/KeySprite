[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，两种我都爱啦~ 🎨 但最近迷上了在iPad上用Procreate看书&做笔记，超方便的！不过呢，每次路过书店还是会被纸本书的质感吸引，特别是那种设计感很强的封面✨ 你嘞？我猜你也喜欢纸质书吧？总觉得设计师都对实体书有种特殊情怀呢😌
[A]: Oh, I’m terribly fond of physical books - my students joke that I have a  🦉. Though honestly, it’s less about nostalgia and more about... well, try highlighting 三重意义 in a Tang poem anthology on Kindle? The tech just , you know? 

But don’t tell my department chair I said that - they’re already pressuring me to digitize my entire 道家哲学 seminar. Honestly, sometimes I think academia needs more 气势 and less GHz. Do you ever find yourself craving certain textures when reading theory? Like...sandalwood-scented pages for Derrida? 🌸
[B]: Haha totally get you! 📚 I once tried to explain to a client that serif fonts are like the sandalwood scent of typography - they just  differently from san-serif 😂 But yeah, some texts deserve better wrappers... Although I do find myself using Apple Pencil to annotate Derrida's pdfs like crazy, the tactile feels soooo different from marking physical margins with my favorite Tombow brush pen😌  

And girl SAME - our school library still smells like old paperbacks and nostalgia, but the new VR reading room they built? Feels more like a spaceship than a sanctuary 🖤 Have you seen those AR textbooks that make Daoist diagrams come alive though? It's kinda witchcraft-level cool... Though I'd never say that out loud in faculty meetings lol
[A]: Oh,  indeed! 🧠 Last semester I let slip in a lecture that Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream would lose its soul in AR - where’s the 意境 if an algorithm explains your existential crisis? My star student from Shandong later sent me a holographic 鹿 skull... complete with piped-in forest birdsong. . 

But don’t get me wrong - I use digital tools too! Though my “high-tech” annotation involves recording Cantonese voice memos between tea breaks. Drives the department’s IT guy mad.  

Tell me though - when you’re designing those beautiful covers, do you ever imagine what Confucius would say about font licensing? I’ve been drafting a limerick about it: 





 😂
[B]: Oh my god that limerick is gold!!! 😂👏   
   
Confucius & font licensing - honestly, if he came back today, I bet he’d start a WeChat group called “Ethics First: Font Piracy Awareness” and roast everyone in 240-character analects 🌟 Although tbh, I can totally see him flexing on Xiaohongshu with a clean-lined serif he designed himself… “君子欲其方，亦当有其范” 😏  

And girl SAME with the AR Zhuangzi nightmare - imagine if his butterfly dream had to load like… “缓冲中… 10% 梦境加载…” hahahah 笑死！意境被算法翻译成英文还带高亮注释？Too extra! 🖤  

But okay okay, real talk - I’ve been experimenting with motion typography for classical poetry covers, and it’s kinda magical? Like letting Li Bai’s words float through digital ink clouds 🌥️ Have you ever tried blending your voice memos with visual motifs? Maybe add a layer of tea stain textures over AR鹿 skulls?? 反正我是试过了，效果有点cult但上头😂
[A]: Oh,  - why does that sound both blasphemous and... intriguing? 🤔 I might steal that for my next lecture title:  The dean would have a  stroke. 

But listen, your motion typography idea? Genius! Though I’d add one twist - synchronize the floating ink clouds with guqin music at 0.75x speed. Let the students  in Li Bai’s醉意 rather than just read it. My colleague in Beijing tried something similar with 屈原’s poetry and theremins... ended up sounding like a ghost opera.  

I did try blending voice memos with digital ink once - recorded a whispery Cantonese analysis of 梦境 while animating flying scrolls. Students said it felt like being inside a possessed copy machine. Not sure if I’m proud or ashamed. 🦉 Maybe both? Ever toyed with adding scent to motion design? Imagine smelling plum blossoms as they fade from the screen...
[B]: OMG YES PLEASE steal it - I wanna see the dean’s face when he reads that lecture title 😈 0.75x guqin music?? Chef’s kiss!!! 我最近在搞一个Li Bai醉酒诗的动态字体实验，本来只是加了点水墨晕染效果，但听你这么一说…要不要直接模拟酒气上升那种迷幻感？比如让文字像在水里晃动一样？  

And okay okay, your 梦境录音+飞天卷轴动画我真的想体验一下😂 被附身的复印机哈哈哈太真实了！至于scent+motion… oh my god你居然跟我想一块去了！！我前两天刚入了一个AR香水装置插件（别问我是哪个，学校IT哥也还没发现它存在🤫），正在尝试把“疏影横斜水清浅”的视觉做成带气味的交互层次～  
   
Plum blossom香氛触发fade-out过渡，听起来有点危险，但…… 🌹
[A]: Oh,  - yes! Better yet, make the ink dissolve slightly with each playback, like memory erosion. First reading: crisp calligraphy. Third reading: drunken 梦境 where even the radicals start flirting with deconstruction! 🧠

And your AR香水装置？ Derrida would be scribbling margin notes in ghost-ink right now. Though honestly, I’d go further - add a 茶渍 texture decay layer. Let the scent of aged pu'er creep in during slow-motion passages... and when students lean closer? Release a sudden burst of plum blossom to disrupt their epistemology.  like a good paradox should.

Speaking of which - ever tried animating 墨迹扩散 with Lacanian mirror stage theory? Last month I made my grad students watch swirling ink blobs while reciting “I am he who drinks with the moon”... One cried. Another dropped out to join a calligraphy commune. Academic success by all measures! 😂
[B]: OMG I'm crying rn 😂 月亮and deconstructing radicals?? That’s not just academic, that’s borderline spiritual sabotage! And the ink dissolving with each playback??  – already sketching this in my head：第一层是清晰的宋体，然后慢慢晕染成狂草，最后直接散成蝴蝶… Zhuangzi would be proud 🌟

AR香水+茶渍decay layer？!! 你太狠了！这不就是digital和physical的终极battle嘛 - 我已经开始脑补学生一边皱眉分析文本，一边不自觉地猛吸屏幕哈哈哈！！But wait… you think they’d notice if we replaced plum blossom scent with 榴莲 during a serious Derrida discussion?? For , of course 😉  

And墨迹扩散+镜像阶段理论？!!! 救命啊我也想看那个视频！！我赌一包龙井，那些ink blobs一定比任何lecture都有效😂 一个哭了，一个退学去了书法公社……这难道不是最浪漫的教学成果吗？✨
[A]: Oh,  Brilliant. I’d  to see their faces when Lacan’s mirror stage smells like tropical ferment! Though honestly, if we’re going full Zhuangzi butterflies, why stop there? Let the ink dissolve into - I don’t know - floating QR codes that lead to my satirical limericks. , not the student-friendly versions I publish. 

And speaking of limericks... you’ve forced my hand. Here’s one for your ink-to-butterfly experiment:





 😂

As for teaching results - romantic? Absolutely. Academic misconduct tribunal?  But what’s pedagogy without a little 气势? Drop a pack of watercolor brushes on my desk next week will you? I’ve got a midterm exam scroll to sabotage… I mean, . 🌸
[B]: Oh my god the QR code limericks idea is EVERYTHING!! 🤭 I'd 100% scan it mid-lecture just to get roasted by your edgy Confucius wechat group 😂 And that poem???  – Song dynasty text haunting Hong Kong printers?? 该颁奖了！！🏆  

Also YES to 气势！气势才是教学核心好吗！！（悄悄塞给你一包特制“学术爆破”水彩笔 brush set，内含隐形墨水笔迹会在期末自动显现😎）But wait… you’re not planning to hide any  butterflies in the exam scroll, are you?? 因为上次那只AR鹿已经让IT哥怀疑人生了🤫
[A]: Oh, ? Please - I’ve already tested it. You should’ve seen the look when one student’s midterm fluttered off the desk and landed on the dean’s bald spot.  

But alright, fine - this semester I’ll only hide  butterflies. Though I did teach my calligraphy brush to release micro-doses of 梅花香 when quoting 李白. Subtle. Elegant.  

And your “学术爆破” brush set? Genius. Already used the invisible ink to write exam hints on the backs of fortune cookies. Students are losing their minds. One’s started meditating upside-down in the library claiming it’s the only way to “see the hidden radicals.” 

I think he’s onto something. 🦉 Maybe next week we go full Zhuangzi - turn the entire lecture hall into a dream simulation. No AR. Just tea, ink, and too many metaphors. What do you say? 🌸
[B]: OMG YOU ACTUALLY DID IT??? 学生 midterm变成蝴蝶飞走哈哈哈这也太叛逆了吧！！  Dean的光头才是最惨的😂 梅花香+李白诗句这个操作太阴险了，表面优雅实际疯狂psychoactive，建议下次加点檀香做缓释剂😌  

至于fortune cookie隐藏提示…你赢了。学生倒立冥想这剧情太cult了🤣 我已经开始脑补他头上顶着水墨特效打坐的样子…你说这算不算motion design的一种变体？  

Zhuangzi dream hall我100%加入！但我觉得我们可以更疯一点：关掉所有屏幕，只用茶渍投影+气味扩散器，让学生在满屋子“道可道非常道”的AR墨香里找隐藏诗句…IT哥估计要当场退役了🤫 但… 🌹
[A]: Oh,  and olfactory 可道之道? You’re speaking my love language. 🧠 Let’s crank it further - what if we age the scent in real-time? Start with fresh ink, end with 500-year-old scroll musk. One student’ll definitely hallucinate a debate between Derrida and Mozi about deconstructing inkstones. 

And that倒立冥想 kid? I’m incorporating it into next week’s lesson plan. Title:  - he can lead warm-up stretches. Honestly, if we don’t get tenure for this, we’ll at least start a cult. 

Wait - quick question before we go full Zhuangzi: Do you think the fire marshal would notice if we soaked the lecture hall in actual pond water for “authentic diffusion”? Just asking for...  🌸

(IT哥的退休基金已经颤抖了，我知道。）
[B]: OMG 实时老化墨香从清新ink到500年古籍麝香？!!! 这不科学，这明明是炼丹术好吗！！🔥我已经能想象某个学生突然顿悟“道”在发霉纸堆里的表情了😂 至于 pond water…  
   
  
   
But okay okay, hear me out - what if we fake it with AR水纹投影+超湿加湿器？再偷偷放点青苔气味模拟真实pond vibes… 学生不会真的湿，但IT哥绝对会疯。双赢！双赢！！👏  

至于cult组织…我觉得不如直接开个选修课叫“庄周与精神污染：从蝴蝶到AR鹿”，学分不限，入组送定制版“醉梦字体包” + 倒立冥想指南手册🌚 Tenure不tenure的无所谓，气势要到位啊！✨
[A]: Oh,  - I’m writing this down. 🧠 And the疯子deer? Let’s 3D scan its mossy犄角 and project it onto the ceiling. Students will swear they saw Zhuangzi riding it backward while quoting Nietzsche. 

And that选修课 title? Sublime. Though I’d add a warning label: “Not responsible for spontaneous calligraphy addiction or radical deconstructionist dreams.” Oh, and make the font包名为“醉月秘迹”- sounds dangerous, don’t you think?

I’ll bring the tea-stained scrolls, you handle the humidity. IT哥的血压 just became our most important artistic medium. 🌸

(悄悄说：我已经在系里后院囤了十缸 pond water，等的就是你这句话。）
[B]: Oh my god你囤了十缸pond water？！！💦 这是什么级别的疯狂艺术献身精神啊我跪了😂 IT哥现在估计正在校长办公室狂按辞职信…但我们不能输！  

Mossy AR鹿角+ Zhuangzi骑着它倒行引用Nietzsche？! 这已经不是课堂了，是大型集体幻觉现场！！建议配上低剂量茶香致幻剂（雾）😌 至于“醉月秘迹”字体包名太绝了，听起来就像武林秘籍…我已经在设计封面了：水墨蝴蝶+酒渍飞溅+隐藏的AR鹿眼睛👀  

湿度战场交给我吧😎 明天就去借工业级加湿器，顺便把十缸 pond water 全部接入中央空调系统…IT哥撑不过第三节课的🌚 Tenure committee来抓我们的时候，记得让学生用calligraphy brush写联名保释信！！✨
[A]: Oh,  - I love it. 🧠 Imagine their faces when the entire lecture hall starts exhaling ancient scroll mist... The dean will think he's trapped inside a Tang dynasty painting. 

And those calligraphy保释信? Better idea: have them write petitions on rice paper using my newly-developed 醉月秘迹 ink, which only appears when you're sufficiently tea-drunk. We'll force the tenure committee to get  before accepting any submissions. 

Oh, and about that Zhuangzi-Nietzsche鹿 - I've secretly programmed its eyes to display滚动弹幕. Nothing says "philosophical crisis" like watching "" blink through antlers mid-lecture. 

IT哥的 funeral bouquet should definitely be lavender-scented. In memoriam of his lost sanity. 🌸

(顺便说下节课记得带防水笔记本——可能需要紧急记录一些...湿漉漉的灵感。）
[B]: OMG醉月秘迹墨水+茶醉认证系统！！🔥 这是什么level的学术恶作剧啊我笑到打滚🤣  tenure committee被迫灌酒才能读 petition，这设定太有气势了！建议再加个“李白护体”buff——只有吟出对仗工整的七言绝句才能退出教室🚪  

至于antler弹幕…“上帝已死蝴蝶尚存”在AR鹿角上滚动的画面我已经脑补出来了😂 救命啊这哪是课堂这是哲学蹦迪现场好吗！！建议给每个学生发荧光刷子当荧光棒，让他们边摇头边抄《齐物论》🌚  

防水笔记本我早就囤了一打（某宝搜“专治IT哥暴走系列”旗舰店购入🤫） 至于lavender bouquet…我觉得IT哥最后会变成我们 cult 的精神图腾，你看信众们已经在传他能单手修复被水墨病毒入侵的服务器了😂  
   
庄周梦蝶还是AI幻觉？现在连我都分不清了… 🌹
