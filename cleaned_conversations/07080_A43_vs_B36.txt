[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must say, historical dramas have a special charm for me. There's something truly captivating about stepping back in time and experiencing the elegance of bygone eras. I often find myself drawn to the intricate costumes, the architecture, and even the way people expressed themselves back then—it’s like taking a journey through a beautifully written novel.

That being said, I do enjoy a good sci-fi film every now and then. The creativity and imagination behind futuristic worlds and advanced technologies can be absolutely mesmerizing. It’s just that historical dramas feel more grounded, more connected to our roots, you know?

I’d love to hear your thoughts—do you lean toward one over the other, or do you enjoy both equally?
[A]: You know, I couldn’t agree more when you say historical dramas feel . There’s a certain weight to the past—like every gesture, every silence, carries history. I especially admire how a well-crafted period piece can make you feel both intimate with and alienated from the characters—it’s a delicate balance between familiarity and distance.  

And yet, I must confess, there’s something thrilling about sci-fi’s speculative nature. It allows us to explore philosophical questions under the guise of technology and aliens. Sometimes, I think   

But yes, I do find myself returning to historical narratives more often. Perhaps it’s because I enjoy seeing how different cultures interpret their own pasts—, if you will. Do you have a favorite era or region that you enjoy revisiting through film or literature?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that—the weight of the past, the silence that speaks volumes. I couldn’t agree more. There’s a quiet dignity in historical dramas that lingers long after the credits roll, isn’t there?

Now you’ve got me thinking… I do have a soft spot for the Edwardian era—there’s something about the restrained emotions and the shifting social dynamics that fascinates me endlessly. The tension between tradition and change during that time makes for such compelling storytelling.

But I must say, I also adore films set in Renaissance Italy. The art, the intrigue, the passion—it's like watching a canvas come to life. And yes, I love how different cultures portray their own history; it adds so many rich layers to the narrative.

Have you come across any particular historical films or books that really stayed with you? I’m always on the lookout for recommendations.
[A]: Ah, Edwardian restraint—such a perfect phrase. It's not just the manners, but the  beneath them, isn’t it? Every teacup placed just so, every glance averted at precisely the right moment. And Renaissance Italy! I couldn't agree more. There’s such lushness in its chaos—political, artistic, spiritual. I always think of Machiavelli when I watch those films—how power and beauty danced so dangerously close.

As for works that have stayed with me... there’s a novel by Yasunari Kawabata, , which, though not strictly historical, carries a kind of quiet historical consciousness—how memory and family echo through generations. In film, I still vividly remember the first time I watched . The scale, the sorrow, the slow erosion of identity—it moved me deeply.

And speaking of identity, have you seen the recent adaptation of  as a miniseries? It’s ambitious, perhaps too much so, but there are moments of such poetic brilliance. I’d be curious to hear your thoughts if you’ve had a chance to watch it.
[B]: Oh, —what a masterpiece! I remember watching it years ago in a small cinema downtown, and I was utterly spellbound. The way identity unravels against the sweep of history is just heartbreaking. I think what struck me most was how personal the tragedy felt, even within such an immense historical backdrop. And the cinematography—those sweeping shots juxtaposed with the smallest, most intimate moments—it’s simply unforgettable.

As for , I must admit I haven’t read it, but now I feel I absolutely should. Kawabata has such a delicate touch, doesn’t he? I can only imagine how he weaves memory and time into something almost tangible. Thank you for the recommendation—I shall add it to my stack.

Now, —yes, I did try watching the new series, though I must confess I found it a bit overwhelming at first. So much depth, so many layers... It’s like trying to take in a vast tapestry all at once. But there were moments—oh, those luminous moments—where everything clicked, and you could feel the weight of ancient wisdom echoing through the screen. I particularly loved the use of poetic dialogue; it reminded me of reading Shakespeare aloud. Have you found certain characters or relationships especially compelling?
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you appreciated —it truly is a film that lingers in the soul. And yes, the intimacy amidst grandeur—that’s exactly it. Bertolucci had such a gift for making history feel achingly personal.

You really should read . Kawabata writes with such restraint, yet every sentence hums with emotion just beneath the surface. It’s not dramatic or overt—it’s more like watching mist gather on a morning pond. Quietly haunting.

As for , I know what you mean about feeling overwhelmed. But isn’t that also part of its beauty? The sheer density of meaning, the way myth and morality intertwine... Personally, I found the relationship between Krishna and Arjuna absolutely riveting. Not just as warrior and charioteer, but as two souls caught between duty and doubt. There was one scene where Krishna says, almost casually, “Life never strives to be what it is not,” and I paused the screen right there. Such profound simplicity.

But tell me—have you ever read any of the classical Chinese novels that deal with fate and empire, like  or ? They offer such different perspectives on power and impermanence, yet still resonate with that same tragic elegance you find in .
[B]: Oh, that line from Krishna——how beautifully simple, yet so deeply philosophical. It’s moments like that when you realize how timeless these stories truly are. I can see why you paused—it feels like a truth that lingers in the quiet corners of the mind long after.

I do love the idea of myth and morality being so tightly woven; it gives the narrative such emotional and spiritual weight. And the relationship between Krishna and Arjuna—you’re absolutely right, it’s far more than duty or loyalty. It’s about the inner struggle we all face, isn’t it? The push and pull between who we are and who we’re expected to be.

Now, as for classical Chinese literature... I must confess, I’ve only skimmed the surface. I’ve always admired  for its sweeping portrayal of ambition and loyalty, though I’ve never read it in full. And  has been on my shelf for far too long—perhaps your mention of it is the gentle nudge I needed to finally open its pages. Do you have a favorite among them? Or perhaps one you’d recommend to someone just beginning to explore this rich literary tradition?
[A]: Ah, I’m delighted you’re thinking of diving in— is a wonderful place to start. It’s often called the , or , and it truly is a masterpiece of emotional depth and social observation. Think of it as an 18th-century Chinese , but with more ghosts, poetry, and tea ceremonies! The characters are so vividly drawn, especially the melancholic Jia Baoyu and the sharp-witted Lin Daiyu. Their inner lives feel startlingly modern.

As for , yes, it’s all about ambition, loyalty, and betrayal on a grand scale. If you enjoy Machiavellian drama with a touch of chivalry, then this one will sweep you off your feet. There's a reason it's been compared to —only with more strategy and fewer dragons.

But if I had to choose just one favorite… I’d say  holds a special place in my heart. It’s part myth, part satire, part spiritual allegory. Imagine a rebellious monkey king traveling across Asia with a monk on a divine mission—there’s action, humor, and profound philosophy all wrapped up in one. I still remember reading the line, “The Buddha is within your own mind; why look elsewhere for salvation?”—it gave me chills.

If you're in the mood for something epic yet deeply human, perhaps start with . And do let me know when you begin—it would be a pleasure to discuss it with you as you read.
[B]: Oh, how wonderfully you’ve described —I can already picture the silk-draped halls and the quiet tension beneath the surface. I do love a story where emotion simmers rather than shouts, where longing is expressed through a glance or the way someone pours tea. And ghosts, poetry, and tea ceremonies? That sounds like everything I adore wrapped in one exquisite package.

I must say, Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu already sound utterly captivating—I’m especially intrigued by her wit and melancholy. There’s something so poignant about characters who feel out of step with their world, isn’t there?

And —oh, a rebellious monkey king! How could one resist that? It sounds delightfully whimsical, yet deeply philosophical at the same time. The line you shared—“The Buddha is within your own mind; why look elsewhere for salvation?”—gave me a quiet pause. That kind of wisdom woven into adventure is such a rare treat.

I think I shall start with . I’ve just the right reading nook by the window, and I imagine it will be perfect with a pot of jasmine tea and an afternoon of gentle rain. Thank you for the recommendation—I’ll be sure to let you know when I begin, and I would truly enjoy discussing it with you as I go along.
[A]: You have such a lovely way of sensing the  of a book before even opening it—I think  will settle into your heart very naturally. There’s a kind of quiet elegance in its sorrow, and yes, Baoyu and Daiyu are souls who feel too much for the world they inhabit. That tension you mentioned—between decorum and desire—is at the heart of the novel. Every tea-pouring, every exchanged glance, is a form of poetry.

And I do hope you’ll share your thoughts on the dreamlike architecture of the贾府, the Jia household—the way spaces themselves seem to carry emotion. It’s one of the most subtle yet powerful aspects of the novel.

As for , there's mischief beneath the philosophy, which makes it such a joy to read. The Monkey King never fails to surprise me—he's arrogant, loyal, foolish, enlightened—all at once. Isn’t that how we all feel sometimes?

Now, with your jasmine tea, rainy afternoon, and perfect reading nook, you’ve painted a scene worthy of Kawabata himself. I truly look forward to hearing your reflections when you begin. Shall we start our discussion after your first few chapters?
[B]: Oh, you’re far too kind—thank you for such a thoughtful response. I do believe  will unfold like a quiet melody in my mind, the kind that lingers long after the final note. The idea that spaces themselves carry emotion—that’s something I’m especially eager to experience. Architecture as memory, as unspoken feeling… how beautifully haunting.

And yes, let’s absolutely begin our discussion once I’ve settled into the first few chapters. I’ll be sure to mark certain passages that strike me—perhaps even ones that make me pause over a teacup or linger on a description of moonlight falling just so.

I must say, this conversation has become its own kind of literary nook—warm, inviting, and rich with anticipation. I look forward to sharing my thoughts with you soon.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely way to put it—this conversation as a . I couldn’t have said it better myself. There’s something truly comforting about sharing the quiet thrill of anticipation before diving into a beloved book.

I’ll look forward to your marked passages with great eagerness—those paused teacups and lingering moonlit scenes are often where the soul of a novel reveals itself. And when you begin reading, do pay attention to the dreams within dreams, the poetry that slips between conversations… they’re like hidden doors in the mansion of the story.

Until then, may your jasmine tea be fragrant and your rainy afternoon soft and deep. Happy reading, my friend. I’m already looking forward to hearing your voice in the echoes of .
[B]: Oh, thank you—your words are like the first page of a favorite book, promising something both comforting and beautifully familiar. I shall indeed keep an eye out for those hidden doors, those quiet moments where poetry slips in unnoticed, like ink bleeding ever so slightly through parchment.

I’ve already set aside my teacup and a shawl for the coming afternoon—I think it’s time I let  weave its spell over me. And when I step inside those pages, I’ll carry your thoughts with me, like a trusted map through an enchanted garden.

Happy reading to you as well—may our stories unfold gently, and may we find new corners of the heart along the way. Until next time.
[A]: Ah, what a tender and poetic farewell—truly, like the closing line of a cherished letter. I’m honored to be your companion on this literary path, even before you’ve turned the first page.

And yes, let the spell begin. May  unfold its silken corridors before you, may every whispered exchange and half-lit courtyard feel like stepping into a world that was waiting just for you.

I’ll be here when you return, perhaps with a cup of tea of my own, ready to wander through the garden with you, page by page.

Happy reading, dear friend. Until we meet again in the quiet rustle of turning leaves and ink-stained dreams.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that—together we step into the hush between pages, where stories breathe and wait for hearts ready to meet them. I feel as though I’m holding an invitation, not just to read, but to truly  through this world of silk and sorrow, of glances that speak louder than words.

I can already picture those courtyards bathed in soft moonlight, the scent of plum blossoms on the breeze… and yes, I shall walk them with care, with wonder.

Happy reading, dear friend. May our wanderings be slow and deep, and may we find, in every rustling leaf and ink-stained line, a little more of what it means to feel, to remember, to dream.
[A]: Ah, yes—, where stories truly live. That’s exactly it, isn’t it? Not just the words themselves, but the silence around them, the breath before the telling. You have such a gift for finding that quiet space where literature and longing meet.

And those courtyards… I do hope you’ll describe them to me when you walk through them—how the moonlight settles on the stone, how the wind carries memory. Perhaps we’ll both find something there, among the plum blossoms and whispered regrets.

Happy reading, dear friend. May your wanderings be gentle, your dreams wide-awake, and your heart always open to the stories waiting in the stillness.
[B]: Oh, thank you—your words are like that very hush you spoke of, soft and full of unseen light. You’ve captured what it means to truly read—not just to follow a story, but to step into its breath, to feel the spaces between lines as deeply as the lines themselves.

I shall most certainly describe those courtyards to you—the way moonlight slips through latticed windows, how the wind carries more than sound, how every stone seems to remember footsteps long gone. I suspect there will be much to share, and I can think of no one better to walk those pages with.

Happy reading, my dear friend. May we both find something tender in the stillness, something lasting in the dream.
[A]: Ah, yes—. That’s a line fit for a poem, or perhaps a prayer. You have such a way of catching the soul of reading before you’ve even begun. I do believe you were born for this kind of story.

And I shall wait with quiet anticipation for your descriptions—the latticed windows, the remembering stones, the wind that carries more than we know. Perhaps in sharing them, we’ll build our own little garden between conversations, one made of ink and memory.

Happy reading, my dear friend. May every page feel like a homecoming, and may you find not just stories, but echoes of your own heart within their folds.
[B]: Oh, how deeply your words settle—like the first quiet rain after a long summer, gentle yet reaching every hidden corner. You're right—reading is not just an act, it's a kind of return, a homecoming to places we've never been and yet somehow know by name.

I do believe we are already building that garden, one line at a time. I can almost see it—lit by lantern light, lined with ink-stained paths, where every step stirs a memory we’ve yet to write.

Until we meet again among the pages, may your own heart find its quiet corners, and may every story welcome you like an old friend arriving at dusk.

Happy reading, dear friend. Always.
