[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question that reminds me of Dickens' opening line in  - "Now, what I want is, Facts." Let me put it this way: while the parchment itself may be losing some symbolic capital in our credential-saturated era, the rigorous intellectual training behind it remains invaluable. Much like how we still read 19th century novels not for their binding but for their enduring insights.
[A]:  

My friend, let me tell you something - in the film industry, I've seen both Harvard graduates and high school dropouts create cinematic magic. That degree? It's like a movie trailer - gives people an idea of what to expect, but the real story is in the full feature. 

You know what really matters? The ability to tell compelling stories and work under pressure. I once worked with a director who never finished film school, but boy could he frame a shot like nobody's business! 🎬
[B]:  How fascinating that you mention framing - it brings to mind the structural parallels between cinematic composition and literary narrative architecture. That uneducated director of yours might have instinctively grasped what we spend semesters analyzing in Henry James'  or 张爱玲's intricate spatial metaphors. 

Though I must say, your analogy about movie trailers rather proves my point - even the most dazzling preview requires someone who understands the grammar of visual storytelling. And that grammar, my dear, is precisely what formal education cultivates.
[A]:  

Listen, I'll give you that - education gives you the tools. But here's the 真相 (truth): I've sat through enough pitch meetings to know that passion and raw talent can't be taught in any classroom. Some of our greatest cinematographers learned their craft lugging equipment on set, not from textbooks. 

That being said...  you do need to know the rules before you can break them like Tarantino or 王家卫. Maybe that's where the degree comes in - it's like learning the classic three-act structure before you go making your nonlinear masterpiece.
[B]: Ah, your 真相 reminds me of the untranslatable tension between 功夫 (gōngfu) as mere technique versus 功夫 as cultivated mastery. You're quite right about Tarantino's deliberate violations of narrative convention - much like how E.M. Forster's  dissects the very rules he later subverts in . 

But tell me, when your self-taught cinematographers encounter the limitations of their empirical knowledge - say, needing to articulate why Kurosawa's  works structurally - don't you wish they'd at least audited a few lectures on narratology?
[A]: 

You're speaking my language now! Let me share something - last year we had this brilliant young director who shot an entire feature on iPhone. Revolutionary stuff, but when I asked him about Eisenstein's montage theory? Blank stare. That's when I sent him to binge Tarkovsky films with my old UCLA professor. 

Sometimes you need that academic foundation to understand why your gut instincts work. It's like knowing why the 180-degree rule exists before you intentionally break it for dramatic effect. 🍿
[B]: How delightfully meta - your anecdote exemplifies what we in comparative literature call 'intertextual anxiety of influence.' That iPhone auteur's predicament mirrors Woolf's  paradox: one must first master patriarchal literary conventions before dismantling them meaningfully. 

Though I must gently correct your whiskey-induced enthusiasm - Eisenstein's theories were actually... ... fundamentally dialectical rather than purely intuitive. Much like how 王国维's  demonstrates that true artistic breakthrough requires both 入乎其内 and 出乎其外. But I do appreciate your concession regarding academic foundations. Shall we toast to productive tensions between theory and practice? 🖋️
[A]: 

Ah, you've got me there! But let me counter with this - when Ang Lee made , he blended wuxia tradition with Hollywood storytelling so seamlessly it gave audiences 起鸡皮疙瘩 (goosebumps). That's the magic when instinct meets education. 

Though between us?  I still make all my assistants read Bordwell's  cover to cover. Can't have them thinking film grammar is just... whatever works on TikTok these days!
[B]: Precisely! Your Ang Lee example beautifully illustrates what I term 'the bilingual imagination' - that rare capacity to inhabit multiple aesthetic traditions simultaneously. Much like how 钱钟书's  synthesizes Western modernism with classical Chinese irony. 

And regarding Bordwell... ... I always assign his text alongside 李泽厚's 《美的历程》 to demonstrate how filmic and literary semiotics operate across cultural paradigms. Though I must confess, when students cite TikTok as 'the new visual language,' I reach for my smelling salts.
[A]: 

Oh man, you'd be horrified by our last intern meeting - kids were storyboarding entire scenes based on YouTube shorts! But here's what gives me hope: when I showed them Kurosawa's  next to those 15-second clips? Mind. Blown. 

Maybe education today isn't about degrees, but about creating those 'aha' moments - whether in a lecture hall or my editing suite. Though  I'd still take someone who can quote both Eisenstein and 李安 over a TikTok prodigy any day.
[B]: How refreshing to hear a Hollywood player quote 李安 with such reverence! Your editing suite epiphanies remind me of what we call 'the Proustian moment' in literary studies - when theoretical knowledge suddenly crystallizes through aesthetic experience. 

Though I'd argue those revelatory moments gain depth precisely because someone first painstakingly analyzed Kurosawa's use of the telephoto lens or 杜甫's regulated verse patterns. As the Chinese saying goes: 熟读唐诗三百首，不会作诗也会吟. But enough pedagogy - shall we continue this over that whiskey you've been nursing? I've a rather fine 2003 Pu'er that pairs wonderfully with film theory debates.
[A]: 

Now you're speaking my love language - fine tea and finer debates! Let's make it a proper cultural exchange: you school me on 杜甫's verse patterns, and I'll show you how Scorsese borrowed those same rhythms in . 

Though fair warning - after this whiskey, I might start arguing that 's restraint teaches us more about storytelling than any MFA program. 干杯! 🥃
[B]: Ah, the intoxicating blend of hubris and insight that only emerges during proper 酒过三巡! Your Scorsese proposition intrigues me - we could trace the cinematic equivalent of 杜甫's 顿挫 (dùncuò) technique in ' editing patterns. 

But dare I suggest that Wong Kar-wai's genius lies precisely in his formal training? His ability to subvert Hollywood continuity editing stems from having first mastered it, much like 鲁迅's classical education enabled his vernacular revolution. Now, about that Pu'er... shall we test whether inebriation enhances or impairs our comparative analysis? 干杯 indeed! 🦉
[A]:  

My friend, you just gave me the perfect pitch for our next project - "The Untold Story of 鲁迅 Meets Scorsese"! Picture this: black-and-white cinematography with sudden bursts of color, voiceovers quoting classical poetry... 

 
And here's the kicker - we'll shoot it vertically for Gen Z, then slowly rotate to widescreen as the protagonist gains wisdom. Education meets disruption, baby! Now where's that damn Pu'er?
[B]: The Story of the Stone How delightfully... postmodern. Though I must caution that your 'vertical to widescreen' conceit rather literalizes what Lukács termed 'the dialectic of enlightenment' in narrative form. 

That said... ... your premise does intriguingly mirror 红楼梦's structural movement from worldly illusion to transcendent understanding. Just promise me you'll include proper subtitles when quoting 鲁迅's 《狂人日记》 - none of this 'artistic interpretation' nonsense Hollywood favors.
[A]:  

Deal! And I'll throw in a Criterion Collection-style commentary track with scholars debating your Lukács reference versus 王国维's 境界说. 

 
To education that doesn't end at the classroom door - may our films be as layered as this Pu'er and our arguments as refined as your literary analogies. 合作愉快, my friend! 🎥📚
[B]: What a splendid synthesis of our symposium! Your Criterion proposition demonstrates precisely what I've always maintained - that the most compelling cultural productions emerge from this very dialectic between erudition and innovation. 

As we steep this final infusion... ... let us remember that whether through celluloid or classical texts, the true measure of education lies in its capacity to make us see anew. Now, shall we draft our joint grant proposal before the whiskey overcomes our better judgment? 治学严谨，创作自由 - as the old academic adage goes.
[A]:  

To our future Nobel Prize in Pretentious Hybrid Cinema-Literature Studies! May we confuse film students and literature majors in equal measure. 

 
Next week: I'll show you my secret stash of Eisenstein's storyboards annotated in Mandarin. You bring that first edition of 红楼梦 - we'll get properly 醉生梦死 between montage theory and 太虚幻境! 

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a sudden urge to storyboard 鲁迅's 《阿Q正传》 as a TikTok musical... 🎭
[B]:  Good heavens - must you always take my scholarly metaphors to their most alarmingly literal conclusions? Though I must admit, the prospect of analyzing 蒙太奇 through 太虚幻境's dream logic does hold a certain... intoxicating appeal. 

Very well - I'll bring the 1791 Cheng-Gao edition on condition you abandon all musical adaptations of 阿Q. Some textual complexities, my dear cinematic provocateur, simply cannot be reduced to three-minute vertical videos. Now do sit down before you start storyboarding 杜甫 as an Instagram carousel.
