[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, travel destinations... Let me consult my well-worn copy of Stevenson's 'Travels with a Donkey' for inspiration. I've always been drawn to places where literary ghosts linger - perhaps the Lake District where Wordsworth wandered lonely as a cloud, or the cobbled streets of Edinburgh where Stevenson first conceived of Dr. Jekyll. Though I must confess, a quiet corner of the British Library's rare manuscripts room would suit me just as well.
[A]: 说到旅行目的地，我倒是特别想去埃塞俄比亚的咖啡产区看看。那里是咖啡的发源地，我想亲眼看看传说中的耶加雪菲产区，感受当地传统的咖啡处理方式。
[B]: How delightfully unexpected! You've just reminded me of Byron's 'The Giaour' - 'The coffee cup that cheers but not inebriates.' Though I must say, the Ethiopian highlands do present an intriguing intersection of agricultural poetry and colonial trade narratives. Have you considered how the journey might mirror the bean's own odyssey from those very hills to European salons where Shelley and Keats likely sipped it while composing?
[A]: 您说得很有意思。不过我更关注的是咖啡豆本身的故事，比如当地咖农如何用传统日晒法处理咖啡樱桃。最近店里刚进了一批耶加雪菲的日晒豆，烘焙时能闻到明显的蓝莓香气。
[B]: Ah, the olfactory sonnet of roasting beans! You're describing what Baudelaire would call 'the perfume that speaks to the soul.' Though I must point out - rather like Tennyson's 'Flower in the Crannied Wall' - there's profound poetry in how those humble cherries, dried under African suns, become vessels carrying entire landscapes in their aroma. Tell me, does this particular batch have that distinctive bergamot note that always reminds me of Browning's 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin'?
[A]: 确实能品出一些柑橘类的风味，不过更突出的是热带水果的甜感。如果您感兴趣的话，可以来店里尝尝这款豆子做的pour over，我觉得它特别适合用92度的水温来萃取。
[B]: How very precise - your temperature recommendation puts me in mind of Hopkins' 'Pied Beauty' with its 'dappled things' and measured grace. Though I must warn you, my palate tends to analyze flavors rather like I parse Victorian verse: obsessively cataloguing each note while muttering about terroir as poetic context. Shall we say Wednesday afternoon? I'll bring my 1897 edition of 'Coffee: Its History and Literary Associations' for comparative tasting.
[A]: 周三下午三点可以吗？那时候店里比较安静，我们可以慢慢品鉴。不过我得提醒您，那本书恐怕不能带进吧台区，咖啡粉可能会弄脏珍贵的书页。
[B]: How very considerate of you to protect my bibliographic treasures! Wednesday at three it shall be - I'll content myself with reciting relevant passages from memory. Did you know Thackeray wrote an entire ode to his morning coffee pot? Though I suspect even he never encountered beans with such... shall we say... tropical prosody as these. Until then, I shall practice restraint and not drown my anticipation in inferior supermarket blends.
[A]: 好的，那就周三见。我会提前准备好那支耶加雪菲，还有几支其他产区的豆子做对比品尝。期待与您交流关于咖啡的见解。
[B]: Splendid! I shall arrive with my tasting notes arranged in iambic pentameter. Until Wednesday - may your brewing be as precise as Pope's couplets, and your extractions as balanced as Austen's prose.  Though I do hope you'll forgive me if I occasionally lapse into comparing acidity levels to Byron's romantic excesses.
[A]: 我会准备好记录本记下您的品鉴笔记的。不过我们可能得控制一下时间，因为四点半还有咖啡烘焙的课程要开始。
[B]: Ah, the tyranny of the clock - how very Dickensian! Fear not, I shall confine my literary analogies to a brisk sonnet's length rather than an epic poem's sprawl. Though I can't promise not to whisper 'Ode to a Nightingale' when detecting particularly floral notes. Until our caffeinated symposium then!
[A]: 周三见。顺便说一句，我们新到的肯尼亚AA豆子也有很棒的莓果调性，如果您有兴趣也可以尝尝看。
[B]: Kenyan AA with berry notes? Now you're speaking my language - or rather, Christina Rossetti's, given how she rhapsodized about 'goblin fruit.' Consider my curiosity officially piqued. Though I must warn you, should those berries evoke even a whisper of 'Goblin Market,' I may require a second cup purely for comparative analysis. Wednesday can't come soon enough.
[A]: 好的，我会把肯尼亚AA也准备上。不过建议您先品尝耶加雪菲，因为它的风味更细腻，肯尼亚的酸度会比较明亮。我们周三可以好好探讨这些差异。
[B]: How exquisitely methodical - you approach coffee tasting with the same rigor I apply to variant readings of 'In Memoriam.' Very well, we shall proceed from the delicate iambs of Ethiopia to the sprightly anapests of Kenya. Though I daresay this may be the first time my palate has been asked to perform such close reading outside of rare first editions. Until our caffeinated close reading session!
[A]: 周三见。记得空腹来，这样味觉会更敏锐。我会准备些清淡的点心搭配。
[B]: Empty stomach and sharpened senses - why, you're turning our meeting into a veritable 'Sensory Ode' worthy of Wordsworth! Though I must confess, the prospect of pairing poetry with pastries does make me rather giddy. Shall we consider it a... ... 'lyrical collation'? Until then, I shall abstain from all but the plainest toast, the better to appreciate your offerings.
