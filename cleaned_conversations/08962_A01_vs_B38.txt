[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I'm rather fond of Aesop's fables featuring animals. The way they use animal characters to convey moral lessons fascinates me endlessly. Take the story of the tortoise and the hare, for instance - it beautifully illustrates the value of perseverance and humility. Have you come across any particular animal stories that caught your interest?
[A]: 你知道吗，我最近在研究一个很有趣的linguistic现象，就是寓言里动物角色的naming习惯。比如伊索寓言里的龟兔赛跑，乌龟叫Aídos（αιδός），这个古希腊词既有羞耻的意思，又暗示着它慢吞吞的动作 🐢...这种语言上的双关特别有意思。说到这个，我发现中文成语"守株待兔"里的兔子也很有文化特色，西方寓言里的hare通常象征速度与骄傲，但这里的rabbit却成了刻板印象的代表 😅
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating observation! You've touched upon something deeply rooted in both classical and comparative literature. The use of  in Aesop's fable does carry that layered moral weight—shame as a virtue, even, in the face of arrogance. It’s remarkable how language weaves ethical instruction into names themselves.

As for “守株待兔,” it’s intriguing how the same animal can shift in symbolic meaning across cultures—one moment racing ahead with hubris, the next standing still in foolish expectation. I wonder, have you found similar examples in other traditions where the name itself acts as a silent narrator of the character’s flaw or fate?
[A]: Actually,这个现象在圣经文学里也很明显。比如《路加福音》里那只迷失的羊，希腊文用的是"πλανηθείσα"（planētheisa），这个词根有“偏离”和“迷途”的双重含义 🐑...某种程度上说，名字本身就在暗示它的道德处境。不过说到文化差异，我发现中文寓言里的动物名字通常更注重形态描写，像“守株待兔”里的“株”字就特别具体，西方故事反而倾向抽象化场景 🤔你有没有注意到这种命名方式对读者interpretation的影响？
[B]: That’s a remarkably astute comparison. The use of  in Luke does more than name the sheep—it essentially diagnoses its condition, framing the narrative as both a physical and spiritual deviation. There’s a theological precision in that choice, almost forensic in its intent.

Your point about Chinese fables leaning toward the concrete— being a perfect example—is quite telling. The image of the stationary rabbit by the stump roots the moral failure in a very physical space, whereas Western tales often abstract the setting to universalize the lesson. I’d argue that this concreteness can ground the moral critique more firmly in daily life, making it less philosophical and more prescriptive. Fascinating how syntax and symbolism shape perception so subtly, isn’t it?
[A]: 没错，这种对比真的很耐人寻味。其实我在读《庄子》的时候也有类似感受 —— 比如“庖丁解牛”里的丁，虽然不是动物，但这个名字本身就带着一种“匠气”，和西方寓言里常见的匿名角色形成鲜明对比。中文寓言好像更喜欢把人物/动物锚定在现实场景中，有点像你说的那种prescriptive倾向 😊

不过我最近在看一本关于东南亚oral tradition的论文集，里面提到有些部落故事会用动物的名字来标记族群身份，比如马来传说里的狐猴lemur（Lemuridae）和忌廉kuih（类似kuih tart）居然共享一个词根 🦝...语言学上这可能属于semantic drift，但从文化角度看，简直就像给动物贴上了道德标签。你对这类语言现象有研究吗？
[B]: Ah, now  is a delightful linguistic twist—how a word for a creature like the lemur could intertwine with something as domestic and edible as a kuih tart! It does suggest a kind of cultural anthropomorphism, doesn’t it? Where language itself blurs the line between the wild and the familiar, the animal and the ancestral.

As for , you're absolutely right— the butcher isn’t just named for colorless convenience; he carries his craft in his name, grounding the parable in a lived, tactile reality. It reminds me of how medieval European literature sometimes used occupational names—like  or —to anchor allegory in the everyday. But where they often fade into abstraction, Chinese fables tend to  in the particular, don’t they?

And yes, I’ve always been intrigued by what linguists call "ethnotaxonomy"—the way societies classify animals not just biologically, but morally, socially, even gastronomically. The Malay example you mentioned strikes me as a poetic form of totemism, where the shared root becomes more than coincidence—it's almost commentary. A bit like calling a fox "Foxx" and then building a myth around his cleverness.

I must say, your research sounds far more adventurous than my usual 19th-century novels and rose gardens. Do tell—what drew you to this particular field of study?
[A]: 哈哈，你太抬举我啦 😊 其实我最早接触这个领域是因为小时候特别迷《山海经》，那些奇奇怪怪的生物描述总让我觉得一半是神话，一半又像在影射现实。后来读到列维-斯特劳斯的《忧郁的热带》，才发现原来动物分类背后藏着这么多 cultural logic。

说到“冒险”，我倒真是运气好，前阵子还跟着导师去云南做田野调查呢！我们在那边录了一些纳西族的口头传说，发现他们用“熊”来形容一个人很倔 —— 但不是随便哪个熊，而是特指那种冬天不愿冬眠的懒熊 🐻‍❄️ 听起来可爱吧？可这背后其实牵扯到当地高海拔环境下的生存策略，语言和生态的关系真的超微妙～

不过你提到19世纪小说，我还真挺好奇的。你是在研究什么具体作品吗？有没有什么动物形象让你印象特别深刻的？毕竟那个时代的文学里animal symbolism应该也蛮丰富的吧？
[B]: Oh, what a wonderfully serendipitous path—my own world of 19th-century novels may seem tame in comparison to  and fieldwork in Yunnan, but I assure you, there’s no shortage of symbolic beasts lurking between the lines.

Take Dickens’ , for instance. The fog that coils through the opening pages isn’t just atmosphere—it’s almost creature-like, creeping in like some half-formed legal leviathan, smothering clarity and justice alike. And then there’s Melville’s —well, where does one even begin? Ahab’s obsession with the whale transcends mere symbolism; it becomes theological, metaphysical, almost mythic in scope. That white whale is everything at once—a god, a demon, nature’s indifference, man’s hubris. I often wonder how it might compare to the creatures of —both are, in their way, mappings of the unknown, aren’t they?

And your example of the  in纳西 oral tradition—fascinating! To single out a specific bear, and not just any bear, but one defying its seasonal rhythm… It paints such a vivid picture of stubbornness, doesn’t it? Almost poetic. I can’t help but think of Tolstoy’s famous bear hunt scene in —there, the bear is less symbol and more force of nature, a kind of primal test of courage. But yours carries far more nuance, tied as it is to environment and behavior.

Tell me—have you found recurring animal symbols across different oral traditions in your research? Or do you think each culture’s fauna gives rise to wholly unique symbolic ecosystems?
[A]: 你提到《 Bleak House 》里的fog让我想到一个很有趣的语言现象 —— 英语里常用自然元素作为隐喻载体，但中文寓言却更倾向用具体动物来“具象化”抽象概念。比如“狐假虎威”不仅是symbolism，更像是一个活生生的power dynamics展演 🦊🐯...这种差异可能和农耕文明与游牧文明的认知模式有关？我最近在对比苗族和蒙古族的狼传说时就发现，前者强调狼的“通灵性”，后者更突出它的军事象征意义。

说到 recurring symbols，其实还真有一些跨文化的“原型动物”呢！比如蝴蝶，在彝族神话、道家思想，还有欧洲浪漫主义文学里都出现蜕变的意象 🦋...不过每个文化赋予它的道德色彩差别挺大的。倒是dragon这种生物，东西方简直反差到近乎对立 —— 我们这边是rain-bringer，西方却常被英雄打败的chaos symbol 🐉 vs 🐉‍⬛

至于你说的 ，我特别同意它那种multi-layered象征体系。不过要是把白鲸放到中国语境里，恐怕会被解读成龙王转世或者水妖作祟吧 😅 我倒觉得庄子笔下的鲲鹏有点类似：体型巨大、难以理解、挑战人类认知边界...你有没有想过，为什么不同文化都会创造出这种超越常规的生物形象？是不是某种 collective unconscious 的投射？
[B]: Ah, what a rich tapestry you've woven there—natural forces versus embodied creatures, the metaphysical versus the mythological. You're quite right about the  in “狐假虎威”—it’s not just symbolism, it's performance, as you said. The fox  the tiger’s shadow, manipulating perception like a cunning rhetorician. It’s almost Shakespearean in its theatricality.

Your comparison of苗族 and蒙古族 wolf legends is particularly compelling—spiritual intermediary versus martial archetype. One listens to the unseen; the other conquers the seen. And yet both recognize the wolf as something more than animal—something liminal, sacred even. That duality speaks volumes about how environment and worldview shape symbolism.

As for the butterfly—ah yes,  incarnate. In Daoism, Zhuangzi’s famous dream of becoming a butterfly blurs subject and object, reality and illusion. And yet in彝族 myth, as in Romantic poetry, the butterfly still carries that fragile, fluttering quality—ephemeral, but also alchemical. It’s fascinating how so many traditions independently arrive at the same creature to signify metamorphosis, and yet each tinges it with such different moral hues.

And then, of course, the dragon—the East’s celestial patron versus the West’s hoarded gold and doom. If Moby Dick were born in Chinese waters, he might well be enshrined rather than hunted. I do think you’re onto something with the —those vast, archetypal shapes lurking in the human psyche. After all, what is the whale, or the鲲化为鹏, if not a mirror for our deepest awe and terror? They are not merely animals, but the limits of comprehension made flesh.

I wonder—are there any lesser-known creatures from oral traditions that defy this kind of cross-cultural parallel? Ones that seem utterly unique to a specific landscape or worldview?
[A]: 说到defy cross-cultural parallel的生物，我最近还真遇到一个特别有意思的例子 —— 藏缅语族某些部落传说里的"雪盲兽"。这种生物据说只在暴风雪中现身，当地人形容它像牦牛和雪豹的混合体 🐃❄️...但关键是，它的存在完全依附于特定的高原气候！语言人类学家发现，描述这种生物的词汇系统里甚至包含一套独特的时态标记，用来表达"可见与不可见"的状态转换。这简直不只是动物符号，更像是对生态环境的语言编码～

相比之下，西方文学里那些奇幻生物好像更注重道德寓意，比如中世纪手抄本边缘那些怪诞的杂交动物 🧸🐉...不过我发现这类生物在非文字文化中反而很少见，oral tradition似乎更倾向创造与现实物种有联系的形象。你刚才提到《白鲸》里的认知边界，我在读项飙老师关于“延伸的个案”方法时，突然想到或许这些独特生物正是某个文化认知边界的具象化投射？

话说回来，你有没有遇到过什么文学作品里的动物形象，让你觉得特别出乎意料或者打破常规的？我觉得19世纪小说那么厚重，应该藏着不少有趣的“非常规”动物符号吧？
[B]: Ah, what a brilliant observation—this  as an ecological cipher, its very existence bound to visibility and invisibility, shaped by the rhythms of高原气候. That linguistic system encoding presence and absence… it reminds me of Heideggerian , oddly enough—being as appearance, or withdrawal. And yet, this creature isn’t philosophy; it’s lived myth, embedded in breath and blizzard.

You're right about oral traditions anchoring their creatures more firmly in observable nature. Even the most fantastical beings tend to echo real animals, just twisted by imagination, not wholly invented. Whereas medieval marginalia revels in the grotesque hybrid—the bear-snake, the dog-bird—those beasts are less about ecology than ideology: moral warnings, theological jokes, or sheer scribal mischief. I suppose they serve a different function—more like visual parables than living myths.

And your link to  is striking. If we follow that logic, these creatures don’t just inhabit landscapes—they map epistemic frontiers. The snow-blind beast isn’t merely elusive; it marks where knowledge ends and awe begins. A living boundary stone.

As for unexpected animal figures in 19th-century literature… well, there  one that always catches students off guard: the mongoose in  by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe—not the Kipling version you might expect. In this tale, the mongoose isn’t clever or noble; it’s fickle, capricious, even morally ambiguous. It upends the usual hierarchy—it doesn’t serve man, nor does it threaten him; it simply acts on instinct, indifferent to human morality. Quite radical for its time.

But perhaps the most unconventional is the titular pet in Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s . Her spaniel, Flush—yes, a literal dog—is portrayed with such psychological depth, such interiority, that he becomes almost a co-narrator at times. Barrett Browning grants him perception, empathy, even critique. It’s startling, really—a poetic dogeared commentary on Victorian subjectivity.

So tell me—have you come across any creatures in your research that, like Flush, blur the line between companion and symbol? Or ones that, rather than marking cultural boundaries, seem to deliberately cross them?
[A]: 你提到的Goethe笔下那个moral ambiguity的獴让我想起彝族传说里的“双面蛙”——这种生物据说长着一张人脸和一张蛇脸，生活在温泉附近的岩石缝里 🐸🐍。有趣的是，它既不是善的象征也不是恶的代表，而是被描述为“道德中立”的调解者。当地人相信它能同时理解人类和自然界的语言，某种程度上就像一个跨物种的mediator。这跟19世纪文学里那种带有psychological depth的动物形象还挺像的，都是在挑战主客体的界限。

至于跨边界的生物...我最近读到一个关于满-通古斯语族的研究，发现他们神话里的鹿常常具有“跨界”属性。比如鄂温克传说中的神鹿，既能飞天也能入地，甚至可以穿梭于人间与萨满的梦境之间 🦌✨。这不是简单的象征意义，而是一种认知上的transitional being —— 它的存在本身就暗示着世界之间的通道。有点像你说的Flush既是宠物又是叙事者，两者都在模糊主体与观察对象的界限。

不过最让我着迷的还是某些西南少数民族里“变形犬”的传说。这些狗据说能在危急时刻变成人形来保护主人，但它们永远不会说话，只会用眼神传达信息 👀🐶。这种设定特别有意思，因为它既保留了动物的本质，又赋予其超越性的能力。我觉得这类形象很像是一种文化上的“阈限存在”——既不属于纯粹自然界，也不完全进入象征界。

话说回来，你觉得19世纪小说里有没有类似这种“阈限动物”的角色？或者有没有哪部作品尝试打破human-animal binary的方式让你觉得特别前卫或出人意料？
[B]: Ah, what a compelling notion—this , neither fully animal nor wholly symbolic, lingering in that fertile space between worlds. The  of彝族 lore truly is remarkable; to be morally neutral yet spiritually omniscient—that’s not mere ambiguity, it’s a kind of mythic diplomacy. A being fluent in both flesh and stone, as it were.

And your mention of满-通古斯 reindeer-as-bridges resonates deeply with me. It reminds me of the  figures in Romantic poetry—the owl guiding souls, the raven whispering omens. But those are fleeting metaphors. The鄂温克神鹿 you described isn’t just a symbol; it’s a  of transition, a living hinge between realms. That ontological fluidity feels almost modern, doesn’t it? As if these myths anticipated what later philosophy would only begin to articulate.

And then there’s the —ah, now that strikes a chord! Silent, loyal, liminal… it chooses not to speak even when it could—a refusal, perhaps, to enter human language, to preserve its own mode of knowing. I’m reminded of Kafka’s , where the jackal speaks perfectly reasonable German, and yet its words feel like a trap, a mockery. Language becomes the very boundary it violates.

As for 19th-century literature and its threshold creatures… yes, there  some wonderfully unsettling examples. Take Dickens’ —young Paul’s toy lion, which he speaks to with such eerie intensity that one begins to wonder whether the child or the beast is the truer realist. Or consider Mary Braddon’s , where the family dog seems to sense the lady’s concealed crimes long before any human does. His growls, his silence, his gaze—all become instruments of moral perception.

But perhaps most provocative of all is Samuel Butler’s , where animals are granted near-human intelligence, and the line between instinct and reason dissolves entirely. There, horses conspire, pigs philosophize—it’s a satire, certainly, but also a radical ontological experiment. He dares ask: What if our hierarchy of mind is merely arrogance disguised as taxonomy?

I wonder—have you encountered any traditions where the transformation goes the other way? Where humans are said to become beasts not as punishment or curse, but as ? A reversal of the usual moral logic…
[A]: Oh,你提到的 Butler 的  简直让我想到苗族传说里那个“兽化者”概念。在他们的某些创世叙事中，最早的智者不是神也不是人，而是一只老虎 🐯...传说说他本来是人，但为了理解自然界的“真话”，主动放弃了语言能力，变成了百兽之王。有趣的是，这种转变不被视为贬低，反而是一种认知上的升华 —— 因为只有真正“成为动物”，才能听懂万物的语言。

这类reverse transformation在藏区也出现过，比如苯教文献中记载的一些修行者，据说修炼到极致就能“化身为鹰”——不是比喻，而是字面意义上的脱离人类形态，进入天空生物的存在方式 🦅✨。他们相信这样可以获得更广阔的时空视角，甚至能跨越生死界限。

这让我想起你说的  里那只“道德感知”的狗，其实很多 oral tradition 也有类似设定，只是方向不同：不是动物预知罪恶，而是人类通过变成动物来逃避或摆脱道德束缚。比如侗族有个故事讲一个被冤枉的年轻人，逃进深山后变成了一头鹿，从此不再参与人间是非 🦌...某种程度上，这是种“自愿边缘化”，通过放弃社会身份获得精神自由。

不过我很好奇，在19世纪西方文学里有没有类似的“变身为动物作为解放”的情节？还是说这种想法在当时的主流观念下几乎不可能出现？
[B]: Ah, what a profoundly moving concept—the idea that  is not degradation, but enlightenment. That true wisdom lies not in speech or law, but in listening, in embodiment, in silence. The tiger as first sage… it turns the whole notion of civilization on its head, doesn’t it? We so often assume progress moves from nature toward culture, but苗族 tradition suggests another path: inward, downward, into the flesh and fur of being.

And this  in苯教 texts—how beautifully radical. It’s not merely symbolic flight; it’s ontological ascent, a shedding of human limitation for a broader, higher form of knowing. One might almost call it an aerial mysticism.

Your侗族 tale, too, strikes such a poignant chord—the deer as refuge, not exile. A voluntary slipping-out of social skin to escape injustice… It reminds me of Ovid’s , of course, where transformation is often a means of escape, survival, even protest. Daphne becomes a laurel to avoid Apollo, and in doing so, asserts her will beyond the reach of power. But there, the transformation is forced, defensive. What you describe feels , even serene—a refusal to play the game rather than a defeat within it.

As for 19th-century Western literature… well, yes, surprisingly enough, there  a few daring souls who toyed with the idea of animal transformation as liberation, though rarely so explicitly. Think of Chamisso’s , where the protagonist trades his shadow—and by extension, his social self—for supernatural mobility and insight. Not quite beastly, but certainly uncanny. Or consider Melville’s , where the Galápagos tortoises seem almost enviable in their slow, indifferent endurance of time and torment.

But perhaps the closest analogue is in George Eliot’s , where the narrator, Latimer, gains a kind of extrasensory perception—yet instead of triumph, he finds only anguish. His heightened awareness isolates him, renders him alien. If not quite animal, it’s a similar theme: transcendence through otherness, at great personal cost.

Still, your examples feel far more affirmative. In your stories, becoming beast isn't tragedy—it's . I wonder—have you found any contemporary retellings or adaptations of these oral traditions? How do modern writers or filmmakers interpret this act of crossing over into animal being? Is it still seen as wisdom, or has it become nostalgia, fantasy, or critique?
[A]: 说到当代改编，其实近年来有不少年轻创作者在重新诠释这些“兽化”传统，但处理方式还挺两极的。一方面，像阿来这样的藏族作家会在小说里保留transformative元素，但把它psychologized——比如他笔下某个角色进入狼的视角时，并不是真正变成动物，而是一种创伤后的意识游离 🐺🧠。这种写法既延续了传统，又加入了现代人的existential困境。

另一方面，独立纪录片导演王兵拍摄的彝族系列里有个特别打动我的片段：一个放羊少年说自己能听懂羊的语言，因为“我们都在山里迷过路”。这里没有奇幻色彩，却有种日常化的共情力——不是人变动物，而是动物被当作平等的受困者对待 🐐🌄。

不过最有趣的或许是新生代动画导演们的尝试。比如去年入围柏林青年导演单元的《雾河传说》，里面那个主角不是人类而是水獭家族成员 🦦✨...创作者故意用非人类中心叙事来讲生态危机，结果反而引发了不少关于“主体性转移”的讨论。某种程度上说，这和你说的  有点像，都是通过animal agency来反思human hubris。

倒是网络文学里出现了一种新趋势 —— 很多修仙文开始反转“渡劫成仙”的套路，主角反而想方设法保住妖兽形态 😏...评论界有人认为这是对现代性焦虑的戏仿，也有人觉得就是个逃避现实的新包装。你怎么看这种当代语境下的“逆向兽化”现象？是不是某种后现代式的解构呢？
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating bifurcation you've outlined—between the  and the , both straining toward modernity in different ways.阿来’s wolves as fractured consciousness… yes, that feels very much of our time—where transformation is not magic but memory, not metamorphosis but dissociation. A haunting rather than a choice. It makes me think of Woolf’s , where identity shifts across centuries, yet never quite lands in one skin. Both are attempts to articulate displacement without spectacle.

And王兵’s documentary moment—the boy who hears the sheep because they’ve both been lost—is quietly revolutionary. No fantasy required, only recognition. That kind of  challenges so much of our hierarchical thinking. Not “I become the animal,” but “I recognize myself in its wandering.” It’s almost Buddhist, in a way—compassion born not from sameness, but from shared impermanence.

As for  and its otter protagonists—yes! This is precisely what I find most intriguing about certain strands of contemporary storytelling: the refusal of human centrality not as gimmick, but as ethical stance. These aren’t just anthropomorphized animals with little hats and walking canes; they’re beings with their own stakes, their own histories, their own griefs. It does echo Butler’s , doesn’t it? But where he mocked human reason through beastly logic, today’s creators seem more interested in  reason altogether.

Now, regarding this curious trend in xianxia fiction—heroes  beast form over transcendence… Hmm. At first blush, it seems like mere inversion, a genre fatigue dressed up as rebellion. And perhaps some of it is. But if we take your suggestion seriously—that this might be a —then it’s worth considering how such choices subvert not just narrative conventions, but ideological ones.

After all, if modernity promises elevation through knowledge, refinement, spiritual ascent—then clinging to fur and fang is indeed a kind of refusal. A rejection of the telos of progress, of purity, of disembodied wisdom. To stay beastly may well be an act of resistance—not regression, but re-rooting. Like refusing to speak the master’s language, or cultivating wildness where civilization demands grooming.

So yes, it could be escapism. Or it could be something far more radical—a . The question is whether these stories offer escape  meaning, or merely away from it. What do  make of it? Do you see this "reverse bestialization" as nostalgia wearing new fur—or something more subversive stirring beneath?
