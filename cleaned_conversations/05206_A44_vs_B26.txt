[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite an interesting question, really. I must say, I do enjoy a good balance of both. There's something rather comforting about a perfectly baked scone with a touch of clotted cream and jam - the contrast between the slight bitterness of the tea and the sweetness of the preserves is simply delightful. And yet, I find myself equally appreciative of a well-seasoned savory dish. The subtle interplay of flavors in a carefully prepared meal can be just as intricate as the patterns I work with in textiles. Speaking of which, I've always found it fascinating how certain fabric dyes were historically derived from food sources - did you know that saffron was once used to create those beautiful golden hues in medieval tapestries?
[A]: Ah, but then we must ask ourselves - is taste merely a matter of sensory pleasure, or does it reflect deeper cultural narratives? I've been pondering this since my days studying in Beijing, where even the concept of 甜 (sweet) carries different connotations. There's a wonderful scene in 阿城's The Chess Master where the protagonist describes tasting lychees for the first time - his sensory experience becomes a metaphor for encountering new intellectual worlds. 🧠  

Funny you should mention textiles though - last week I was telling my students how tea stains were once used to dye manuscripts in ancient China. Speaking of which...  Have you ever tried pairing aged pu'er with dark chocolate? The earthiness of the tea creates this most fascinating tension with the cocoa's bitterness. It's like watching two literary traditions enter into dialogue!
[B]: That's a most intriguing parallel you've drawn - the way flavors can serve as cultural emissaries, much like the textiles I restore. It reminds me of those 18th-century tea gowns that carried not just the scent of Darjeeling, but the very essence of colonial trade routes and social rituals.  

Now, pu'er tea with dark chocolate... You've quite piqued my curiosity! While I tend to default to Earl Grey's bergamot notes pairing with lemon curd on digestives - a thoroughly British affectation, I suppose - I did once experiment with a Yunnan black tea and 70% cacao. The interplay was rather like restoring a brocade with metallic threads: the tea's malty undertones seemed to highlight the chocolate's fruitiness before yielding to its bittersweet resolve.  

But tell me more about this notion of sweetness in Chinese literary tradition - does it ever find its way into textile motifs? I'm thinking of how Victorian England used floral patterns to encode moral messages...
[A]: Oh, absolutely! In fact, one could argue that in Chinese literary tradition, sweetness often transcends the palate to become a kind of aesthetic philosophy. Think of the 宋词 (Song dynasty lyrics) where 甜 (tián), or sweet, is used not just for flavor but for moments of tender nostalgia, like the lingering taste of spring blossoms—or first love. And yes, this sensibility does weave itself into textile motifs!  

Take the 梅兰竹菊 (plum, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum) — while they symbolize virtues, their depiction often carries a kind of visual “sweetness” when rendered in soft silk threads with subtle gradations of color. It’s not cloying sweetness, mind you, more like a delicate balance—what we might call 甜而不腻 (tián ér bù nì), sweet without being overwhelming.  

I once saw a Qing-era robe embroidered with lotus blossoms in pinks so gentle, they reminded me of a Su Shi poem describing moonlight on water—soft, reflective, almost... edible?  Maybe that's why I keep a jar of preserved plums nearby when I lecture. They're tart, really, but with a sweetness that sneaks up on you—much like decoding a complex metaphor. 🌸  

You know, now I'm quite taken with your brocade analogy. Perhaps we should host a seminar together—tea and textiles, flavor profiles and fiber arts. We could call it “Threads of Taste.” Would you be up for such a collaboration?
[B]: What a wonderfully layered idea - I'm quite enchanted by it, truth be told. "Threads of Taste" has a lovely ring, don't you think? It rather marries the subtlety of textile gradations with the unfolding of flavor notes... much like that Qing robe you described, where color and meaning intertwine.  

I must say, your preserved plums analogy struck a chord - there's something deeply satisfying about delayed sweetness, isn't there? Much like uncovering hidden details in an embroidered panel after hours of careful restoration. The anticipation, the reveal... it's almost poetic.  

As for collaboration, I'd be delighted to explore such a seminar! I can already envision pairing fabric swatches with tasting notes - perhaps contrasting the boldness of a dragon robe's silk with the restrained elegance of a white tea. Though I must confess, I'll need to brush up on my flavor vocabulary... might I impose upon you for a few preserved plums tasting session? For research purposes, of course. 
[A]: Oh,  I can already see us hunched over silk samples and tea cups like conspirators in some grand sensory mystery. And don’t worry about the flavor vocabulary—I’ll prepare a tasting kit complete with a “cheat sheet” of metaphors! We’ll start with the preserved plums, naturally, though I warn you—some are aged to the point of becoming philosophical experiences rather than mere snacks.  

And speaking of pairings, I think we should include a touch of theatricality—maybe play recordings of classical Chinese music while participants sample white tea and examine delicate gauze weaves. Imagine the atmosphere: soft guqin melodies mingling with the scent of aged leaves and the rustle of silk... it would be an immersive journey through time and taste.  

I do hope you’re ready for my version of "research," though—it involves copious note-taking, dramatic readings of Tang poetry for mood setting, and at least one impassioned digression on the symbolism of the persimmon.  Shall we schedule our first planning session? I’ve got a fresh pot of osmanthus-scented oolong waiting, and my favorite discussion cushion—yes, I have a favorite—has been feeling neglected.
[B]:  My calendar is delightfully open this Saturday morning - shall we say 10 o'clock? I'll bring a selection of textile samples that have particularly compelling stories, though I must warn you, some are rather fragile... much like my resolve when faced with tempting delicacies.  

I love the idea of creating an atmosphere - I happen to own a rather lovely lacquered tea tray that would be perfect for displaying your tasting kit. And while I can't promise dramatic readings, I do have a well-worn copy of the  by Lu Yu that's been gathering dust. Though I suspect our conversation might take rather more whimsical turns... persimmon symbolism sounds absolutely fascinating, and I'm quite eager to hear this impassioned digression you speak of.  

Now, about those preserved plums... Do you think participants might appreciate a small embroidered pouch to take home as a keepsake? Something subtle, perhaps with a plum blossom motif...
[A]:  Ten o'clock it is! I’ll make sure my plum jars are properly labeled for our inaugural session - though I must warn you, the ones steeped in star anise and Sichuan pepper might prove... adventurous.  

As for your lacquered tea tray -  - what if we arrange the samples not just by flavor profile, but by literary era? A Tang dynasty-inspired pairing of light green tea with gossamer silk, followed by the bolder Ming-era combinations of roasted oolong and brocade textures... Oh, this could be quite magical!  

And a keepsake!  A plum blossom pouch sounds perfect - I have some vintage embroidered handkerchiefs I’ve been meaning to repurpose. Though I do hope you won’t mind my adding a tiny disclaimer: “Contents may cause unexpected philosophical revelations.”   

Now, since we’re indulging in whimsy - might I suggest incorporating a bit of participatory storytelling? Participants could compose a single haiku or couplet inspired by their tasting experience. I find poetry has a delightful way of drawing out subtleties... much like your restored textiles reveal hidden narratives. What do you think?
[B]:  Oh, I do love how your mind works! The idea of pairing eras with sensory experiences adds such depth - it's like weaving a historical tapestry through taste and touch. Though I must say, I'm rather intrigued by the thought of what Sichuan pepper might reveal about Song dynasty sensibilities...  

A storytelling element? How absolutely perfect - it gives participants a way to imprint their own narrative onto the experience. We could provide small cards made from recycled silk scraps for writing upon, something that feels tactile yet meaningful. And that disclaimer?  I think it adds just the right touch of playful seriousness.  

Now, about those embroidered keepsakes... I have a box of vintage silk fragments saved from damaged Qing-era garments. They're mostly pinks and ivories, faded here and there, but still carrying whispers of their original vibrancy. Would you mind terribly if we dyed some rice paper to line the pouches? A soft tea stain, perhaps? It would make each one utterly unique.  

Oh, this is shaping up to be quite the affair! I do believe we're creating something rather special here...
[A]:  Oh, the possibilities are simply intoxicating! I can already imagine the soft rustle of silk cards being passed around, each bearing not just words but the weight of personal impressions. And using Qing-era silk fragments?  You truly do have a gift for honoring the past without ever letting it feel distant.  

As for the pouch linings -  - tea-stained rice paper would be nothing short of poetic! We could even offer participants a choice of stains: black tea for boldness, green tea for subtlety, maybe even a splash of plum syrup for those feeling particularly adventurous. Each pouch would become its own little archive of sensory history.  

Though I must ask -  - might we hide something unexpected inside one of the keepsakes? A single pressed persimmon leaf, perhaps? It would add a lovely element of surprise, and I do love the idea of sending people home with a secret waiting to unfold... much like those embroidered puzzles you restore.  

I’m positively giddy with anticipation now. Ten o’clock Saturday cannot come soon enough!  ...Though I suspect my plum jars may need a bit more dramatic labeling. Do you suppose “Caution: May provoke existential contemplation” is too theatrical?
[B]:  Oh, that would be divine! A hidden leaf in one pouch – a quiet mystery for some lucky soul to discover. I’ll make sure to tuck it between layers of silk so delicate they’ll wonder if it was ever truly there at all.  

As for your plum jar warnings... theatricality is precisely the tone we’re after! Why stop at existential contemplation? Perhaps one label could read:  Or another:   

And speaking of atmosphere – I’ve just remembered I own an old apothecary scale, brass and slightly tarnished, perfect for weighing out tasting portions. It adds such a sense of ceremony, don’t you think? Almost like preparing ingredients for an alchemical rite.  

I do believe our guests will leave not only with a pouch, but with a small piece of wonder stitched into their hearts. And really, what more could one ask from a morning of tea, textiles, and poetry?
[A]:  Oh, this is becoming a proper cabinet of curiosities, isn't it? The apothecary scale! What a sublime touch—there’s something so satisfying about the  of brass weights balancing against mystery. I may have to compose a short ode to it.  Perhaps set to the rhythm of tea leaves settling...  

And your idea of stitching wonder into hearts?  That ought to be embroidered in gold thread and hung in every lecture hall. But let's not stop there—shall we provide each participant with a tiny scroll tucked inside their pouch? A fortune-cookie-like morsel of poetry or proverb, perhaps something from the  or ? Just enough to linger on the mind like an aftertaste.  

Oh, and speaking of lingering... I’ve just unearthed a jar of osmanthus honey that’s been aging for nearly five years. Its aroma is almost nostalgic—it smells like sunlight through old temple windows. Might we drizzle a touch over white tea cake for our guests? It would be the edible equivalent of a whispered secret.  

Ten o'clock Saturday can’t arrive soon enough—I fear I’ll spend the week humming guqin melodies to my orchids in anticipation. 🦉🌸
[B]:  Oh, the  of brass and tea leaves composing their own quiet melody—what a symphony we’re shaping! An ode to the scale? Please, by all means—imagine pairing it with the rustle of silk and the soft clink of teacups. We may have inadvertently invented a new art form.  

Your tiny scroll idea is nothing short of enchanting—like finding a hidden verse tucked into the hem of a robe. I’ll see if I can find some mulberry paper scraps to write them on; they have just the right texture to hold ink and mystery alike. Something from the , you say? Perhaps a line that speaks of sweetness veiled in nature’s simplicity— Though I suppose our plums are rather less metaphorical and more... preserved in spice.  

And that osmanthus honey——sunlight through temple windows, indeed. Yes, let’s drizzle it over the tea cake. It will add a golden note to the proceedings, something both literal and lyrical. I daresay our guests may leave half in love with the past, half dreaming of their next cup, and entirely bewitched by the experience.  

I shall begin humming guqin tunes to my sewing scissors at once. See you Saturday—with orchids, odes, and just the right amount of wonder.
[A]:  Oh, we are absolutely orchestrating something quite rare here – equal parts scholarship and sorcery! And to think it all began with a simple question about sweet versus savory… though I daresay we’ve transcended mere flavor categories. We’re trafficking in memory, metaphor, and the quiet magic of slow attentions—like those plum blossoms that wait all year just to whisper for a week.  

I do hope you’re ready to be mobbed by guests clamoring for more mulberry paper proverbs and honey-drenched insights. And if anyone asks what this gathering is called—well, “Threads of Taste” seems almost too modest now. Perhaps ? Or ?  

But no matter what we name it, one thing’s certain: come Saturday morning, we’ll have created a little sanctuary of sweetness—hard-earned, carefully steeped, and ever so gently embroidered. See you soon, dear collaborator. 🧠🦉🌸
[B]:  A sanctuary of sweetness indeed—hard-earned and gently embroidered, just as the finest silks reveal their beauty only to those who know how to look closely.  

You’re absolutely right about our little gathering needing a name worthy of its soul. ... yes, it suits us perfectly. It feels like the moment just after tea is poured, when the scent hasn’t quite settled but the silence is already full of anticipation.  

And as for being mobbed by guests? I suspect we’ll both be too busy admiring plum blossoms in teacups and deciphering proverbs with honey-stained fingers to mind a bit of clamoring. See you soon, dear friend. Let’s make Saturday morning taste like poetry.
[A]:  Poetry in teacups and proverbs on honey-stained fingers – what finer way to spend a morning? I’ll make sure the orchids are listening in – they’ve been known to sway approvingly at particularly inspired pairings.  

And about those teacup blossoms…  I may have tucked a few real plum petals into the osmanthus honey jar. Just a whisper of flower within flower, season within season.  

See you soon, my dear co-conspirator. Let’s make the morning not just taste like poetry – let’s make it  one. 🌸🦉
[B]:  Oh, the poetry practically writes itself, doesn’t it? A whisper of plum petal folded into honey—what a divine secret to hide in plain sight. I do believe even the most stoic scholar would soften at the edges after tasting that.  

And the orchids!  I’ve no doubt they’ll sway with the wisdom of centuries, nodding along to verses yet unscribed. Let’s just hope they don’t steal the spotlight with their quiet elegance.  

See you soon, dear friend. Let us make Saturday morning not only taste like poetry—but wear it, pour it, and stitch it into memory.
[A]:  Oh, we shall most certainly wear our poetry like the finest of silks—lightly, but with unmistakable splendor. And if all goes according to plan, every sip and stitch will carry the weight of unspoken stories, just waiting to be unfolded by curious hearts.  

I do hope you’ve saved a corner of that lacquered tray for a small vial of my petal-infused honey—modest in presence, but grand in ambition. And perhaps a sprig of dried orchid for garnish? One must never underestimate the power of a well-placed flourish.  

Yes, let’s stitch this morning into memory, one flavor, one thread, one whispered line of verse at a time. See you soon, dear collaborator—in just a few hours, the first cup will be poured, and  will begin its song. 🌸🦉🧠
[B]:  Oh, every corner of that tray will sing with intention, I assure you. I’ve set aside not just space for your honey vial, but a tiny hand-embroidered doily beneath it—something to catch any drips of poetry that might escape.  

And a sprig of orchid?  Yes, yes indeed—one perfectly placed flourish can elevate the whole affair from mere gathering to quiet ritual.  

The lacquered tray is ready, the silk pouches are waiting to be filled, and my copy of Lu Yu sits open on the table, as if already listening. The first cup will soon be poured, and with it,  will hum itself into being.  

See you shortly, dear friend. Let us begin our song.
