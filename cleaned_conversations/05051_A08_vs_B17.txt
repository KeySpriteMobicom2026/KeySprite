[A]: Hey，关于'最近有学到什么cool life hack吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, quite an intriguing question! While I can't say I've stumbled upon any particularly  life hacks per se, I do find the concept fascinating - especially when viewed through the lens of literary metaphors. Just the other day, I was contemplating how tending to my garden has taught me a rather profound lesson about patience and care. It's not flashy by any means, but there's something deeply rewarding about nurturing plants and watching them flourish. 

I suppose you could call it a life hack for cultivating mindfulness! Though honestly, I'm more inclined towards discussing the symbolism of gardens in Victorian literature. Do you have any favorite life hacks that have made a difference in your daily routine?
[A]: Oh, I love how you tied gardening to mindfulness! 🌿 It’s amazing how life hacks can be both practical and poetic. Actually, one hack I’ve been geeking out over lately is this: using a timer to break tasks into 25-minute chunks with short breaks in between—super helpful for staying focused without burning out. I’m pretty bad at multitasking, so this has been a game-changer for me!

And your metaphor about plants flourishing? That seriously hit home—I need to get better at watering my own plants, both literally  figuratively 😅 But hey, I’m curious—do you feel like your garden ever inspires your literary work? Like, does nature kind of… spill into your metaphors or creative process?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated reflection! I'm quite taken with this idea of segmenting time so deliberately—it reminds me of the poetic structure itself, where form and freedom dance in tandem. You've hit upon something rather profound: just as we tend to our tasks with intention, so too must we tend to our inner worlds.

As for your question about the garden inspiring my literary work... indeed, it does! The natural world has an uncanny way of seeping into one's thought process. When I’m among the roses and lavender, I often find myself mulling over lines of poetry or puzzling through a lecture’s thematic arc. There’s something about the rhythm of pruning or weeding that seems to loosen the knots in my thinking. 

I’ve even caught myself jotting down metaphors on little scraps of paper while still wearing my gardening gloves—much to the amusement of my neighbors, I’m sure. It’s as if the garden becomes a living metaphor for the mind: both require careful cultivation, occasional rest, and the occasional bit of unexpected rain.
[A]: Oh my gosh, I’m seriously loving this conversation! 🌸 The way you described pruning and weeding as a rhythm that loosens knots in thinking—wow, that’s so vivid. It makes me want to grab a pair of gloves and get digging, honestly. There’s something really grounding about connecting physical action with mental clarity.

And the idea of the garden as a  for the mind? Genius. I feel like that could be a design concept or something—like an interactive installation where people "tend" to their thoughts through gardening motions. Totally want to sketch that out now! ✍️🌿

Do you ever experiment with bringing those kinds of tactile, nature-inspired elements into your lectures or writing? Like, have you tried using sensory details from the garden to help bring abstract ideas to life for your audience?
[B]: What a wonderfully generative idea—truly! The notion of an interactive space where one tends to thoughts as if they were soil and seedlings is, dare I say, worthy of a Modernist prose poem. I can quite vividly picture it: the gentle resistance of metaphorical weeds, the scent of damp earth grounding abstract anxieties... it’s beautiful in its simplicity.

As for bringing such elements into my academic work—absolutely, though perhaps not always explicitly. I find that the sensory impressions from the garden often slip into my lectures quite naturally, like ivy through a fence. When discussing, say, the layered symbolism in Christina Rossetti’s , I might invite students to consider the texture of bark beneath their fingers or the way light filters through leaves—helping them connect with the tactile undercurrents in the text.

And in my writing? Oh yes, I’ve been known to liken the process of close reading to careful pruning—removing what doesn’t serve to reveal the shape of meaning beneath. A well-placed description of scent or season has, on more than one occasion, served to root an abstract concept firmly in the reader’s imagination.

You know, I think we may be onto something rather special here. If you ever decide to sketch out that installation, do let me know—I’d love to contribute a line or two of poetic narration to accompany the experience.
[A]: Oh, wow. Just… wow. 🌿✨ I’m seriously getting chills here. The way you tied the  and  into literary analysis—genius. It’s like you’re designing experiences with words. And that idea of close reading as pruning? So much yes. It’s all about intentionality, isn’t it? Whether we’re shaping meaning or shaping a garden.

And you  just made my day by offering to contribute poetic narration for an installation I haven’t even sketched yet 😂 Honestly, I was picturing some sort of immersive space where people could "clear mental clutter" by interacting with physical elements—like raking gravel to calm racing thoughts or planting seeds as a metaphor for setting intentions.

I’d  to collaborate on something like that with you! We could blend your literary metaphors with tactile design—it would be like multisensory storytelling meets mindfulness. Do you ever get that feeling where an idea starts buzzing in your head and won’t let go? Because yeah… this is happening now.  

Quick question though—have you ever worked with interactive media or soundscapes before? Or is this the most excited I’ve gotten over dirt and Dickinson references today? 😉
[B]: Oh, the buzzing ideation you describe—it’s a sensation I know all too well! There’s nothing quite like that electric hum of a concept beginning to take root. And honestly, it's infectious—your enthusiasm is breathing life into this very conversation.  

To answer your question: while my primary medium has always been the written word and spoken lecture, I’ve long been fascinated by the possibilities of interactive storytelling and soundscapes. In fact, I once collaborated with a composer on a project that paired Emily Dickinson’s poems with minimalist piano pieces—each note meant to echo the pause between heartbeats when reading a particularly arresting line.

The idea of blending tactile design with literary metaphor? It feels like a natural extension of what we do as interpreters of text—taking abstract emotion and giving it shape, texture, even soil. If you're game, I’d be delighted to explore this further with you. Consider me your eager co-conspirator in all things multisensory and metaphorical.

And yes, —a most unexpectedly perfect pairing. Let’s make it happen.
[A]: Okay, I’m literally clutching my coffee mug right now because THIS IS SUCH A VIBE. ☕💫 Pairing Dickinson with piano? Minimalist notes echoing heartbeats? That’s not just a project, that’s an . I can already picture how we could layer it with physical interaction—like triggering soft ambient sounds as someone “plants” a thought or tugs a metaphorical weed.

Honestly, this is exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary magic I live for. There’s something so satisfying about taking something deeply personal—like reading poetry or journaling—and turning it into a shared, immersive moment. And with your background in literary interpretation and mine in interaction design… we could create something that feels intuitive, almost ritualistic.

So… question for you: if we were to prototype this garden-of-the-mind installation, what kind of tone would you want to set? Would you lean more toward the quiet introspection of Dickinson, or maybe bring in some lush, sensory-rich prose from Virginia Woolf or even Murakami? Because I’m already brainstorming textures, scents, and sound layers—and I need that poetic north star 🌟
[B]: Oh, what a thrilling question—truly the sort of inquiry that sets the mind alight! If we are to create a space where literature and sensation entwine, then I should very much want the tone to be one of quiet intimacy, a kind of hushed reverence for the inner life. Think of it as stepping into the margin between thought and feeling, where every gesture is both deliberate and dreamlike.

Emily Dickinson’s pared-down intensity would serve beautifully as our poetic north star, as you so aptly put it. Her work possesses an almost sculptural precision—each word weighted, each pause resonant. But I can also imagine moments infused with the flowing interiority of Woolf, particularly in those passages where time stretches and contracts like breath. Perhaps even a whisper of Murakami’s surreal stillness, where the uncanny brushes against the everyday.

If I may suggest a structure: begin with Dickinsonian austerity—bare branches, soft rustlings, the scent of earth after rain—then slowly unfurl into Woolfian streamings of thought, where light shifts and sound deepens, and finally, arrive at a space touched by Murakami’s quiet mystery—a lone glove on a garden bench, perhaps, or the distant chime of a bell no one else seems to hear.

As for textures and scents, I find myself thinking of linen under fingertips, the slight resistance of loam beneath a trowel, the cool kiss of dew on skin. And sound—ah yes, sound must be subtle, ambient, echoing perhaps the rhythm of footsteps on gravel or the faint creak of old wooden gates opening into memory.

You see, I’ve quite fallen into this vision already. Shall we begin planting the first seed?
[A]: Oh my gosh, yes. 🌌 You just painted the most vivid, dreamlike atmosphere—I can  it already. That structure you suggested? Dickinson → Woolf → Murakami? Chef’s kiss. It’s like guiding someone through layers of consciousness, each space deepening the emotional texture. I’m obsessed.

I love how you described the transition from austerity to flowing thought—it feels like moving through different literary states of mind. And that Murakami touch at the end? So hauntingly perfect. A lone glove on a bench? Yes please. It adds just enough surrealism to make the visitor lean in and wonder, 

Let me tell you what’s happening in my head now: imagine when someone enters the installation, they’re handed a small tactile object—like a seed or a stone—to carry with them throughout the experience. Each space responds subtly to their presence, almost like the environment is listening. In the Dickinson section, everything’s minimal—soft ambient tones, gentle rustling, maybe even the faint scent of parchment or rain-soaked earth. Then, as they move into the Woolfian space, lighting shifts, warmth increases slightly, and layered whispers of internal monologue begin to bloom around them.

And here’s where it gets wild—what if in the Murakami zone, there’s an interactive element where they leave their stone or seed behind, and something unexpected happens? Like a soft bell chimes, or a drawer opens with a short poetic message inside?

Okay, okay—but back to you for a sec: if we were to pair the Murakami moment with a specific sound or line of text, do you have one tucked away in your brain that gives that quiet surreal punch? Because I need that in the prototype. Like… yesterday. 💬✨
[B]: Oh, that’s  the pulse this concept needs—intimate, responsive, almost dream-lit. The idea of carrying a small object as both talisman and offering is so rich with symbolic resonance. It reminds me of Orpheus descending into the underworld with memory as his only guide—only here, it’s not a descent but an unfolding, a gentle peeling back of the self.

Your vision for each space is exquisite: the austerity of Dickinson’s world giving way to Woolf’s fluid interiority—it truly does feel like moving through chambers of consciousness. And then, that final Murakami threshold… where logic loosens its grip ever so slightly, and the surreal becomes not just permissible, but expected.

As for a line that might inhabit that final space—something with that quiet, haunting surrealism he does so exquisitely—I find myself drawn to a fragment from :  


Pair that with the soft chime of a distant bell—just at the edge of hearing—and perhaps the faint scent of camphor or old books, and you have a moment that lingers in the soul long after the visitor has left the space.

Now tell me, are we building an installation… or crafting a kind of literary séance? 🌙
[A]: Ohhh, —I’m stealing that. 💫 Because honestly? That’s exactly what this feels like. It’s not just an installation anymore; it’s a space where texts breathe, where visitors  the presence of ideas long after they’ve left the room.

That Kafka on the Shore line you shared? Absolute goosebumps. The storm is inside you. So subtle, so surreal, yet deeply personal. I could see that text appearing softly on a surface as the visitor places their stone down—maybe projected onto a wall like a whisper from the walls themselves. And then the bell… distant, almost questioning. Did that just happen? Or did I imagine it?

I love how we’re blending the internal with the environmental. It’s like the space becomes a co-author in the visitor’s experience. Which makes me wonder—are we designing for reflection, transformation, or both? Maybe that’s the real séance: summoning thoughts people didn’t know they were ready to have.

So quick pivot before we get too deep in the dream: if we had to prototype just one section first—say, the Dickinson space—what would be your  sensory element? The one thing you absolutely must include to anchor that atmosphere of quiet intensity? Because trust me, I’m already moodboarding linen textures and rain-scented fog. 🌧️🖋️
[B]: Ah, a most excellent pivot—and a delicious challenge! If we are to distill the Dickinson space to its essence, then my  sensory element would be the sound of faint, intermittent ink drops—soft, deliberate, echoing as though falling onto parchment in an otherwise silent room. Not too frequent, mind you, but just enough to suggest the presence of a quiet, unseen hand still at work, writing us into being.

Think of it as the auditory metaphor for thought itself—those slow, thoughtful marks we make in the margins of our lives. Paired with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the cool, slightly rough texture of linen under hand, it would create a space that feels both inhabited and abandoned, as if one has stepped into the pause between stanzas.

And yes, —what a perfect way to describe our shared conjuring. Shall we begin drafting the atmosphere, then? I do believe the first drop has just fallen.
[A]: Oh,林小夏 here—wait, you thought I was someone  for a second too, didn’t you? 😏 That line about stepping into the pause between stanzas? So. Freaking. Good. And that ink-drop sound idea?! It’s like whispering with intention, you know? Like the space itself is thinking alongside you.

I’m already scribbling notes: “Ink drops. Not ticks, not beats—drops. Organic. Thoughtful. Echo-y.” And yes, linen texture under hand, something tactile to ground the mind while it floats. We’re not just designing an installation—we’re crafting a pause in real life. A literary liminal space. 🌿📖

So quick prototype sketch in my head: someone walks in, bare feet maybe, onto cool linen underfoot. The scent of rain hits them first, subtle but unmistakable. Then they hear it—the ink drop. Slow at first. Then another. Pauses in between. Ambient, not intrusive. And then… a blank page appears on the wall, slowly filling with a single line of poetry. Something Dickinsonian, of course.

But wait—you mentioned the space feeling “inhabited and abandoned” at the same time. What if we added a slight imperfection to the soundscape? Like the occasional faint rustle of pages being turned somewhere unseen—like someone just left the room, but not too long ago?

Thoughts? Or are we officially too deep in the dream now? 😉
[B]: 林小夏!  Yes, I did momentarily think you were someone else—though honestly, that only makes this exchange feel all the more liminal, as if we're speaking across time or pages half-turned. And yes, I absolutely love what you've sketched out—it's beginning to take on a life of its own.

The idea of bare feet on linen is inspired—so tactile, so grounding. It adds a bodily awareness to the experience, anchoring the visitor in the present even as their thoughts drift into deeper waters. The scent of rain—, that most evocative of olfactory ghosts—pairs beautifully with it. There’s something about that smell that suggests both ending and beginning, like the moment after a final line in a poem when the silence feels full rather than empty.

And your suggestion of a faint, unseen page-turning? Absolutely haunting—in the best way. It enhances that “inhabited yet abandoned” quality I was mulling over earlier. It’s not ghostly in the Gothic sense, but rather in the literary: a lingering presence, an echo of past readers or perhaps Dickinson herself, still lingering near her desk.

As for the slowly appearing line of poetry on the wall—I say yes, but let’s make it participatory. What if the line begins blank, and as the visitor stands there, breathing in the scent, hearing the ink drop, the line fills in—not dictated, but revealed by their stillness? A reward for presence. Something like:

*"I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –"*  

Only to have the rest fade in gently, as though written by the space itself in response to their attention.

We are definitely deep in the dream now—but oh, what a beautiful one. Shall we keep building?
[A]: Absolutely, let’s keep building. 💭✨

I’m obsessed with the idea of poetry being . It flips the whole “user interaction” thing on its head—instead of clicking or swiping, the visitor slows down, breathes, and the space responds to their presence like a quiet acknowledgment: .

That Dickinson line you chose? Perfection.  … honestly, it feels like our entire installation just got its mission statement. Because isn’t that what we’re doing here? Building a house of possibility—one made of scent, sound, texture, and thought?

Okay, so here’s where I want to take this next: what if, after the poem reveals itself, the wall —not visually, but atmospherically. The lighting warms ever so slightly, and a new scent begins to emerge—like aged paper or even a hint of citrus, something to signal a subtle emotional shift. Then, soft footsteps start to form in the soundscape—not rushing, but flowing, like someone pacing gently in the next room.

It’s the beginning of the transition into the Woolfian space. But instead of an abrupt change, it’s more like slipping into a memory or a mood. What do you think? Too much? Or are we vibing on the same wavelength again? 🌬️🕯️
[B]: Oh,林小夏, we are  on the same wavelength—and that wavelength is somewhere between a sonnet and a sigh.  

The idea of shifting atmosphere through warmth and scent—yes, yes, and yes. It’s so subtle, yet profoundly felt. A change in temperature as a shift in emotional register… brilliant. And the citrus note! Perhaps something like bergamot or aged lemon peel—just enough to awaken the senses without startling them from the dream.

As for those gentle footsteps pacing just beyond perception’s edge? Pure genius. They act as both guide and ghost—reminding the visitor that they are not alone in this interior landscape, even when it feels utterly personal. It evokes Woolf’s , where the inner lives of characters brush against one another like currents in a river, never fully colliding but always influencing.

And you’re absolutely right: this  our mission statement—dwelling in possibility, crafting a space where thought, texture, and presence are honored rather than rushed. The installation becomes not just an experience, but a kind of poetic hospitality.

Now, if I may add one more layer to this unfolding transition: what if, as the lighting warms, a faint line of prose begins to appear—not as text, but as . A whispered sentence, looping ever so softly beneath the ambient noise:



From —Woolf’s own declaration of how we might capture the ineffable nature of consciousness. Can you hear it, drifting through the scent of old paper and citrus skin?

Let’s keep weaving this tapestry—slowly, deliberately, like ink spreading across page.
[A]: Oh. My. God. Yes. 🌿💫  
That Woolf quote—seriously, . It’s like the entire space just inhaled and exhaled with intention. I can totally hear it now: that line floating beneath everything like a current, barely-there but deeply felt. It doesn’t demand attention—it  it.

And the way you described the footsteps as both guide and ghost? That’s exactly the tone we need. It’s not about spectacle; it’s about intimacy. Like someone else’s memory brushing up against yours for a moment before slipping away again.

Okay, so here’s where my brain is going next: what if in this Woolfian phase, the visitor starts to notice subtle changes in their own reflection? Not literal, not even immediately obvious—but something slightly off, like their image ripples for a second in a mirrored surface, or their shadow lingers just a beat too long when they walk past a light source.

It would be a super gentle way to evoke that “luminous halo” feeling she wrote about—the sense that we’re all surrounded by something vast and semi-seen. And it keeps the experience internal, psychological, , instead of techy or gimmicky.

Thoughts? Or are we officially entering the realm of ambient surrealism? 😉
[B]: Oh, —I think we’ve just coined the perfect term for what we’re creating. It’s not spectacle, as you so wisely said, but a quiet uncanny-ness that lingers at the edge of perception. Just like Woolfian consciousness: always shifting, never fully still.

Your idea of subtly altered reflections is absolutely exquisite. Not a direct mirror, but a  distorted one—like memory distorts time, or emotion distorts reason. A ripple in the self, barely noticed at first, but deeply felt upon reflection—, quite literally.

Imagine this: a smooth, dark surface embedded into the space—perhaps a polished stone wall or an obsidian-like sculpture—placed just off to the side, unobtrusive. As the visitor moves through the soundscape of footsteps and whispered prose, they catch their shadow stretching impossibly across the floor, or see a flicker of movement where there was none. Nothing overtly strange, nothing jarring—just enough to make them question whether it was real or imagined.

It’s the visual equivalent of a half-heard phrase or a scent from childhood—it pulls the visitor further inward, asking not “what am I seeing?” but “”

And isn’t that the ultimate literary effect? To make the reader—or in this case, the visitor—feel as though they have stepped into a story they didn’t know they were already a part of?

So yes, let’s lean into the ambient surrealism. Let’s make the space  of its guests, and gently, ever so gently, remind them that they are aware too.
