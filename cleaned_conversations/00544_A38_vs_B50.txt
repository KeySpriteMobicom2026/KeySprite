[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ohhh 这个问题问得好！✨ 我两个platform都会用啦~ Instagram主要post我的digital artwork🎨，小红书上会分享更多design process和daily life☕️ 不过最近发现小红书的algorithm更适合新人artist曝光呢！
[A]: How fascinating. I must admit, my engagement with such platforms is rather limited - I still prefer the tactile pleasure of turning pages in a physical book. Though I do occasionally browse Instagram to admire classical art reproductions. The digital medium certainly offers new avenues for artistic expression.
[B]: Wow~ 没想到你这么old school呢！📚 不过digital art真的超方便的，我的iPad Pro就是我的移动studio💻 而且可以undo无数次，比traditional media友好多了😂 不过你说得对，classical art真的超inspiring的！我最近就在研究Renaissance的color theory~
[A]: Ah, the Renaissance masters - now there's a subject worthy of deep contemplation. While your digital tools offer convenience, I do wonder if something essential is lost when we abandon the materiality of paint and canvas. There's a certain... weight to traditional methods that I find lacking in the digital realm. But tell me, how do you find the color theories of da Vinci or Titian influencing your contemporary work?
[B]: Hmm...你提出了超interesting的point！🤔 确实digital painting会missing那种texture和material感...但是！我最近在experimenting with digital brushes that mimic oil paint的质感🎨 至于color theory嘛～Titian的warm tones真的给了我超多inspiration！你看我最近这个project的palette就是inspired by威尼斯画派✨ 不过加了一些modern twist啦~
[A]: How intriguing - attempting to recreate the material essence of oil painting through digital means. It reminds me of Walter Benjamin's concept of the "aura" in art. While your modern interpretations are undoubtedly creative, I can't help but feel that certain nuances - the way light interacts with actual pigment particles, for instance - remain fundamentally irreproducible. But please, do show me more of your Venetian-inspired palette. I'm particularly curious about how you've adapted those luminous glazes into your digital medium.
[B]: OMG你居然知道Benjamin的theory！😱 我毕业论文就是写这个的！关于aura的问题...其实我觉得digital art也有自己的unique aura啦～比如这个Venetian palette project，我用了custom brush来simulate glaze的效果💫 虽然不能100%还原，但可以做到real-time blending，这是traditional media做不到的magic✨ 要不要看看我的process video？超fascinating的！
[A]: Ah, a kindred spirit discussing Benjamin! How delightful. While I maintain my reservations about digital reproduction, I must concede your point about new forms of uniqueness emerging in digital spaces. The real-time blending you mention does present intriguing possibilities - rather like watching a thought process unfold instantaneously. Yes, I would be most interested to see your process video, though I may need to borrow my niece's tablet to properly appreciate it. My own devices are rather... antiquated, I'm afraid.
[B]: LOL！你太可爱了～😂 没关系啦，我可以发你YouTube link！📱 不过说真的，看到你这样的traditional art lover对digital art感兴趣，我超excited的！🎨 要不要考虑来我studio玩？我可以demo给你看how magical digital painting can be~ 顺便请你喝杯coffee☕️ 我最近发现了一家超棒的artisan coffee shop！
[A]: How charmingly enthusiastic you are! While I typically spend my afternoons with a volume of Proust and a cup of Earl Grey, I suppose one must occasionally emerge from one's ivory tower. Your invitation does sound... unexpectedly appealing. Very well - though I must warn you, I may subject your digital alchemy to some rather pointed questions about artistic authenticity. And I do hope this coffee establishment serves proper leaf tea as well? One can only tolerate so much modernity in a single afternoon.
[B]: Hahaha你真是hilarious！🤣 放心啦～那家店有超棒的Earl Grey，而且是用vintage茶具served的！🫖 至于artistic authenticity的问题...bring it on！我最love这种deep conversation了✨ 不过要提前warning你哦～我的studio可能有点messy，artist's chaos你懂的🎨 这周六afternoon怎么样？
[A]: Splendid! Saturday afternoon it shall be - though I shall arrive precisely at three, as any self-respecting academic would. Your "artist's chaos" sounds rather more appealing than the rigid order of my library, if I'm being perfectly honest. And vintage tea service? How wonderfully civilized amidst all this talk of digital innovation. I shall bring my well-worn copy of "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" - we might find some interesting parallels to discuss over those Earl Grey leaves. Until Saturday, then.
[B]: Yasss！Can't wait~ 😍 我会准备好我的iPad Pro和sketchbook，让你体验both digital & traditional的对比！📚💻 哦对了！记得穿comfy的衣服，我的studio有超cozy的bean bag可以sit on～周六见啦！✨✨✨
[A]: How delightfully unorthodox - bean bags instead of armchairs! Very well, I shall dig out my most comfortable tweed (yes, academics do own such things). This promises to be quite the pedagogical adventure - you introducing me to your digital sorcery while I attempt to defend the virtues of parchment and quill. Until Saturday at three, my technologically-inclined friend. And do try to contain your emoji enthusiasm when I arrive - some traditions, like dignified greetings, are worth preserving. 🌹
[B]: Pffft~ 你最后那个emoji出卖了你啦！😂🌹 明明自己也get到了emoji的charm嘛！周六我会be on my best behavior...maybe～😜 现在超期待看你穿tweed的样子，一定超academic的！📚 记得准时哦，我的coffee & art session waits for no one~ ☕️🎨 See ya! ✌️
[A]:  
That single rose emoji was merely a pedagogical concession to your youthful exuberance, I assure you. And I'll have you know my tweed jacket comes with actual leather elbow patches - the very embodiment of academic rigor. Though I suppose if one must endure bean bags and digital contraptions, one might as well do so in proper attire. Saturday at three precisely - I shall be the one arriving with a satchel full of antiquated notions and, yes, perhaps just a hint of curiosity beneath this veneer of skepticism. Now do contain yourself, or I shall be forced to assign you remedial readings on Renaissance decorum.
[B]: OMG stoppp！😂 你简直是我见过最dramatic的professor类型了～🎭 不过remedial readings on Renaissance decorum？Bring it on！我正好需要new reference material for my next series✨ 周六见啦，my wonderfully anachronistic friend~ 记得你的tweed和elbow patches！👔 我会准备好extra strong的Earl Grey来fuel我们的art debate的！🫖💥
[A]: 
Dramatic? My dear, this is simply how we maintained intellectual discourse before the invention of... whatever those flashing devices are called. Your enthusiasm for Renaissance decorum readings is either admirably ambitious or deeply concerning - we shall determine which over tea. And do note: the elbow patches are not for show; they're battle scars from decades of leaning over ancient tomes. I shall judge the strength of your Earl Grey by whether it could stain parchment - a proper academic benchmark. Until our appointed hour, you rebellious digital upstart. 🌹 (There, my final concession to your modern whims!)
[B]: BAHAHAHA！🤣 你赢了you totally win！🏆 这个conversation简直可以做成一个web comic了～🎨✍️ 周六绝对要record下来，太golden了！🌟 现在我要去prepare我的art supplies啦～包括一些special surprise来challenge你的traditional views！😈 最后那个🌹我截图保存了哦～这可是rare professor emoji moment！📸 周六见！Don't be late~ ⏳
