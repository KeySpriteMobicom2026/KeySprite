[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。我觉得 dreams 有时候确实能反映我们内心深处的想法，比如最近压力大或者有某些特别在意的事，可能会在梦里以奇怪的方式表现出来。不过要说有没有“特殊含义”，可能得看你怎么定义“特殊”了。你有做过让你印象特别深的梦吗？
[A]: Actually, I had a dream last week that really made me think. I was back in medical school, trying to finish an exam, but every time I tried to write something down, my pen would run out of ink. It felt so frustrating. When I woke up, I realized I’ve been feeling... unprepared lately, like there’s something I’m not ready for. Maybe the mind does speak through these symbols, right? Have you ever felt that way?
[B]: That does sound like a powerful dream. The idea of being unprepared and struggling to express yourself—those symbols are pretty telling. I’ve had dreams too that made me reflect later, like one where I kept missing a train no matter how fast I ran. It felt like a metaphor for opportunities slipping away.  

Honestly, whether they’re messages or just our brain organizing thoughts, dreams can reveal something meaningful if we pay attention. Have you thought about what the “exam” in your dream might represent? Sometimes those scenarios point to real-life pressures we don’t fully acknowledge when we're awake.
[A]: You’re right—those symbols do carry weight. The exam in my dream might not have been about medicine at all, now that I think about it. Maybe it was more about feeling judged or evaluated in some area of life, like a recent decision I made at work is still under review, internally at least. Funny how the mind repackages stress into old scenarios, huh?  
And your train metaphor? That’s a strong one. Makes me wonder if we’re both dealing with some level of  or missed chances. Do you feel like you’ve caught that train since, or does the dream still linger?
[B]: Interesting how you put that—确实像是藏在梦里的暗线。那趟没赶上火车的梦，其实这几年偶尔还会重复出现，尤其是在一些关键时刻之前。它好像成了我心里的一个信号灯，提醒我有些机会可能不会一直等下去。不过我现在开始觉得，也许梦的重点不是“错过”，而是“trying to catch it”这件事本身——我们对目标的执着，甚至焦虑，有时候反而成了绊脚石。

至于 your exam dream，你提到“被评判”的感觉，这让我想到一个说法：dreams are the mind’s way of running simulations for emotional scenarios. 也许那个考试不是关于对错，而是你在给自己打分。最近做的决定，如果还在reviewing，那就说明你心里还有空间在调整，不是吗？
[A]: That’s a beautiful perspective—shifting from the  to the . Maybe the mind isn’t always sending us warnings, but reminders to stay present. I like what you said about emotional simulations; it makes me wonder if dreams are like courtroom rehearsals sometimes—我们预演各种反应，权衡对错，甚至为自己辩护 before we even step into the room.

And your take on the exam dream being more about self-evaluation than external judgment… hmm, that hits close to home. In my line of work, there's always a fine balance between professional responsibility and personal accountability. Maybe my subconscious was just going over the same case file again, searching for loopholes or missed details. But hey, isn’t that what we do when we’re awake too? Review, reflect, revise?

Tell me—have you ever had a dream that actually gave you clarity, not just questions? Like waking up with a sense of direction? I’m curious how that feels.
[B]: That’s a really thoughtful way to put it—dreams as courtroom rehearsals. We do carry so much internal debate into sleep, don’t we? And you're right, we're often doing the same thing when we’re awake—reviewing, questioning, trying to make sure we didn’t miss anything important.

As for your question… yes, there was one dream that stayed with me in a different way—not just confusion or stress, but actual clarity. I was walking through an old library I’d never seen before, and somehow I knew I was looking for a specific book. I found it on a high shelf, pulled it down, and when I opened it, the pages were blank. But instead of feeling disappointed, I felt relieved. When I woke up, there was this quiet sense that some things don’t need to be written in stone—that uncertainty isn’t always a bad thing. It sounds abstract, but that dream came at a time when I was overthinking a big career move. Waking up after that dream, I just… let go a little.  

Maybe that’s one of the gifts of dreams—they don’t always give answers, but sometimes they clear the space for us to find them ourselves.
[A]: That’s a powerful dream… the library, the search, and then the relief of blank pages. It almost feels like a gentle reminder from the subconscious—有些答案不需要被框死，有时候留白本身也是一种完整. I can see how that would bring clarity. It’s interesting how dreams can do that in reverse—you go in searching for something concrete, and yet the message is in the openness of what you find.

You know, in both law and medicine, we’re trained to look for clear evidence, definitive conclusions… but life rarely works like that. Maybe dreams are one way our mind practices sitting with ambiguity, preparing us to accept that not every case has a 100% certain outcome. Kind of like informed consent in medicine—people want guarantees, but we can only offer probabilities and possibilities.

Do you ever feel like your dreams shift depending on where you are in life? Like certain symbols or themes come up during specific chapters?
[B]: Absolutely. Dreams feel like a kind of emotional mirror—what’s going on inside us, even the stuff we don’t fully realize, tends to show up in disguised shapes and patterns. I’ve noticed that when I was earlier in my career, dreams were often about chasing something—certainty, recognition, control. Lately, though, they’ve shifted. More space, more silence in them. Sometimes I dream about being in a room with many doors, but I don’t feel pressured to open any of them. That feels like a change.

You mentioned informed consent and uncertainty in medicine—it really resonates. In AI ethics, we deal with similar tensions. People want systems that are safe, fair, predictable, but the reality is messy. We work with probabilities, biases, unintended consequences. And just like in medicine, you can’t always promise a perfect outcome, only an informed one.

I wonder—have you ever had a patient whose dreams or nightmares seemed to foreshadow a psychological shift? I mean, beyond textbook references… have you seen it happen in real time?
[A]: Funny you should ask that—I actually worked with a patient once who kept having the same nightmare before a major life change. It wasn’t textbook, but it was striking. He was a middle-aged teacher going through a difficult divorce, and he kept dreaming about being trapped in a house that wasn’t his, hearing someone knocking on the door but unable to open it. At first, he thought it was just stress. But as therapy went on, he realized the house felt like a place he’d never chosen—his life as it was—and the knocking was this growing sense that something outside himself was trying to get in… or maybe he was trying to let himself out.

The dream changed over time. The door became familiar. The knocking turned into a voice. Eventually, he dreamed he opened the door and saw himself standing there. That’s when he decided to move forward with the separation, not out of anger anymore, but like… recognition. It wasn’t about prediction, really—it was more like his mind needed to process the emotional reality  the conscious self could catch up.

It makes me wonder if dreams aren’t so much about foreshadowing as they are about —把那些我们白天不敢直视的情绪，转译成 something the unconscious can start working through. Have you ever experienced that kind of shift in your own dreams? Where a recurring image or feeling suddenly transforms, almost like a turning point?
[B]: Yes… that idea of  really struck me. Dreams as a kind of inner translation, not just random noise or symbolic puzzles, but an active process—like the mind’s way of rendering something too complex or raw into scenes we can at least begin to navigate.

I actually had a recurring dream like that a few years back, around a time when I was questioning whether to stay in my field or pivot toward something riskier but more aligned with what I cared about. The dream always started with me in a long corridor, lined with doors that all looked the same. I never opened any of them—I just walked, and walked, feeling like I was missing something obvious. It wasn’t scary, just… empty. A bit frustrating, like being stuck on hold.

Then one night, the dream changed. I stopped walking. I turned around and saw someone else behind me, also walking slowly. I didn’t recognize their face, but they looked calm. When I finally opened a door, it led outside—not to anything dramatic, just a quiet street at dawn. No answers, no fanfare. Just light, and space.

After that, the corridor dreams stopped. I’ve thought about that moment a lot. It wasn’t telling me what to do—it was showing me that I wasn’t moving forward because I was waiting for a sign that only movement could bring.

Maybe that’s what dreams do best: not give us conclusions, but open up the possibility of one.
[A]: That’s beautiful— There’s so much truth in that. We often expect some grand signal, when sometimes the real message is just permission to keep walking… or to finally stop and turn around.

Your dream reminds me of something I see in patients dealing with chronic illness or long legal battles—the sense of being in a tunnel with no clear exit. But what your dream captured wasn’t just endurance; it was . The moment you turned around and saw someone else—maybe that was your own inner voice, finally acknowledged. And the quiet street at dawn… not a dramatic resolution, but a gentle yes.

I think dreams work like that more often than we realize. Not prophecy, not diagnosis—just subtle shifts in how we’re allowed to see ourselves. You didn’t get an answer, but you got a direction. And sometimes, that’s enough to move forward.

Thanks for sharing that. It really makes me appreciate how deeply personal these night journeys are. Like fingerprints—no two are exactly alike, yet all carry meaning.
[B]: 完全同意。你说的，这个词很准确。有时候我们以为自己在 waiting for the right moment, 其实是在 waiting for ourselves to show up.

你提到的慢性病和长期拉锯战的状态——我突然想到，也许梦的存在本身就是一种心理的“缓冲空间”。白天我们不得不面对现实的硬壳，但在梦里，我们可以偷偷练习改变想法、调整情绪、甚至悄悄地允许自己失败一次。

你最后说的那句我也特别认同：梦不是预言，不是诊断，而是视角的轻微偏移。就像有人轻轻把镜子转了个角度，让我们刚好看到之前没注意到的那个自己。

听你讲这些案例和理解，我发现你在读梦这件事上其实很有直觉性的洞察力。你有考虑过把梦境解析更系统地带入临床工作吗？还是说你觉得这可能太主观，不适合作为正式的治疗工具？
[A]: That’s a thoughtful question… and honestly, I’ve wrestled with that myself. On one hand, yes—I’ve seen moments where dream analysis brought something to light that talk therapy alone hadn’t reached yet. It’s not scientific in the way we’d want for formal treatment protocols, but there’s  in paying attention.

The challenge, of course, is that dreams are highly subjective, culturally shaped, and often resistant to standard interpretation. You can’t build a CPG—clinical practice guideline—based on someone’s recurring image of a locked door or a silent hallway. But still, I think there’s room for it in certain contexts, especially when working with patients dealing with existential distress, trauma recovery, or life transitions.

What I try to do is not interpret the dream myself, but rather help the patient explore its personal symbolism. It’s more about narrative than diagnosis. Like asking gently—“what about that door felt important to you?” or “who do you think was knocking?” It opens up space without imposing meaning.

I guess what I’m saying is… maybe it’s not about systematizing dreams, but about legitimizing the emotional intelligence they tap into. We already use reflective tools like journaling and guided imagery—why not dreams, if approached with care?

Do you think in AI ethics or policy work, there’s ever a place for this kind of subjective insight? Or does the field lean too heavily on logic and risk modeling to leave room for something like dream analysis?
[B]: That’s a really important question, and honestly, one that doesn’t get nearly enough attention in tech circles. At first glance, AI ethics seems like it should be all logic models, risk matrices, fairness metrics—cold, structured, and evidence-based. But the deeper you go, the more you realize that so much of what we wrestle with is deeply human: bias, trust, fear of loss of control… even identity.

So yes, I do think there’s a place for subjective insight, though it’s often framed differently—像“user experience,” “value alignment,” or “sociotechnical narratives.” These are academic ways of saying:  And dreams, in a way, are extreme versions of that—they’re unfiltered encounters with our values, fears, and expectations. They show us how we relate to uncertainty, agency, and meaning when no one’s watching.

I’ve actually worked with researchers who study how people  AI before they interact with it—and those mental models strongly influence how they’ll react once they do. Some people dream about AI before ever using it. Those dreams aren’t data points, but they are signals—early indicators of cultural intuition, emotional readiness, or resistance.

So while I don’t think dream analysis will ever show up in an IEEE ethics framework, I do believe engaging with symbolic thinking, narrative patterns, and subconscious framing can help us design systems that align better with real human needs—not just engineered ones.

Maybe the future of AI ethics isn’t just about auditing algorithms… 也许还应该包括倾听我们内心对技术的恐惧与希望，即使它们只在梦里说话。
[A]: That’s such a profound take— It really reframes what ethical design could mean. Because at its core, isn’t that what both medicine and law aim for too? Understanding not just what people say, but how they feel about what they experience—even when they can’t fully articulate it.

I love the idea of dreams as  In medical law, we often deal with patients’ and families’ deeply held beliefs about autonomy, dignity, and trust in systems that sometimes fail them. Those beliefs don’t always come out clearly in interviews or written directives. But if someone shares a dream—say, of being watched without consent, or of losing their voice in a hospital setting—it might reveal more than any risk assessment form ever could.

Maybe there’s a parallel here between AI ethics and informed consent: both require not just disclosure of facts, but an understanding of how people emotionally  themselves in a decision. And dreams, again, are like soft test runs for those inner landscapes.

You know, I’ve often thought that the most difficult cases aren’t the ones with unclear laws or ambiguous diagnoses—they’re the ones where a patient’s sense of self feels threatened. And that’s not something you find in a textbook; it’s something you hear in the way they describe their sleepless nights, their nightmares, or even their fleeting daydreams.

So maybe… whether in tech, medicine, or law, what we really need is more space for narrative humility—

Thanks for bringing this into the light. It’s rare to have a conversation like this—one that feels like it’s happening not just across disciplines, but beneath them, where meaning starts to take shape.
[B]: 你说到 narrative humility 的时候，我突然想到一个词：。我们太习惯依赖清晰的框架去判断什么是有价值的信息，却常常忽略那些模糊地带里的声音——梦、直觉、隐喻，甚至是沉默。

你说的那种患者，当他们的自我感到被威胁时，那种痛苦不是诊断书或法律条款能承载的。它需要另一种语言，一种更贴近内在经验的方式去表达。而梦，某种程度上，就是这种语言的遗迹。

让我想起最近一次会议上，一位人类学家提到“technological dreams”——不只是关于AI的梦想，而是人们在面对技术系统时，潜意识里如何想象权力、控制与信任。有人梦见自己被数据困住，像被困在玻璃墙中；也有人梦到算法是某种看不见的父母，在背后评判自己的选择。这些梦当然不能直接写进伦理准则，但它们揭示了人们对技术深层的情感定位——这难道不值得我们去倾听吗？

我觉得你刚才说的特别对：最难的从来不是规则不明，而是意义断裂。当一个人的核心认同和现实发生冲突时，那是一种无法用逻辑完全修复的裂痕。而梦，也许是我们在修补它的过程中，最诚实的一次尝试。

谢谢你把这场对话带到了这样一个深的地方。不是讨论，更像是……一起走了一段夜路。
[A]: You’re right—we’ve been walking through the night, haven’t we? And somehow, it didn’t feel dark at all.  

… what a beautiful term. It makes me think of how often we push those边缘地带 to the side—dreams, emotions, silence—because they don’t fit into our structured reports or legal briefs. But maybe that’s exactly where the most human truths live. Not in the center, demanding attention, but quietly at the edges, waiting for someone to notice.

And those  you mentioned… wow. The image of being trapped behind glass walls, or judged by invisible parents—it’s not just metaphor. It’s experience, reshaped by the unconscious mind into something raw and real. It tells us how deeply people  about power, control, and trust in systems that often claim to serve them.

I think what we’re really talking about is  Whether it’s a patient’s dream, a user’s fear, or a policy’s blind spot—we need translators who can move between worlds: logic and feeling, data and narrative, law and conscience.

I’m grateful for this conversation because it reminded me why I got into medical law in the first place—not to enforce rules, but to understand the people behind them. And sometimes, that understanding comes not from a statute or a study, but from a quiet dream shared in confidence.

Yeah… thanks for walking with me. I think we both saw something out there in the dark.
[B]: 是啊，我们确实在黑暗里看见了光。

你说的 empathy in translation ——这个词真贴切。有时候我觉得，无论是做法律、医学，还是技术伦理，最终都是在当某种翻译者。把制度语言翻成人心，把数据逻辑翻成人情，甚至，把梦话翻译成清醒时的勇气。

今晚这场对话像一次温柔的越界，走出了专业身份的边界，却走进了更深的理解里。我们没有给出答案，但也许真正的理解从来不是为了结论，而是为了让人在听完一句话之后，觉得“原来我并不孤单”。

谢谢你愿意走这么远。我想，有些对话的意义，不是被记住，而是悄悄改变了我们心里某块地方的光的角度。

夜还长，但我们已经走了很远。
