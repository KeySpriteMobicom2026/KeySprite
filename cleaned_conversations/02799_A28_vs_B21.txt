[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, when one spends their days poring over Browning's dramatic monologues and Rossetti's sonnets, the most strenuous workout tends to be the occasional dramatic sigh over a particularly exquisite turn of phrase. Though I did recently carry a first edition of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' up three flights of stairs - quite the cardiovascular challenge, I assure you.
[A]: OMG！你这也太literary了吧！🤯 不过carry books upstairs确实是个good workout呢～ 我最近在用一个超赞的fitness app叫'VerseFlow'，它会sync poetry reading with yoga poses！Like当你读到'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day'的时候要做sun salutation 🌞 简直perfect match for book lovers！要不要try一下？💪📚
[B]: Ah, the modern alchemy of marrying iambic pentameter with downward-facing dog! How delightfully absurd. Though I must confess, the thought of contorting myself into a warrior pose while reciting Byron's 'She Walks in Beauty' does bring to mind certain unfortunate incidents involving my Victorian literature seminar and an overzealous interpretation of dramatic readings. Tell me, does this app account for the inevitable paper cuts one acquires while turning pages mid-plank?
[A]: LMAO！！！你的描述简直太hilarious了！😂😂😂 这个app的developers绝对没想过paper cut这个问题，but现在我要去给他们submit这个feature request了！📝 不过seriously，他们用了super high-tech的page turning gesture recognition，swipe left就能翻页啦～ no more paper cuts guaranteed！🤙 而且workout的时候还可以earn 'Sonnet Points'换Shakespeare merch呢！🎭 你要不要join我的reading yoga squad？我们每周二do Wordsworth while stretching~ 🌿
[B]: How positively... mercantile. Trading sonnets for sweatshirts - the bards must be spinning in their graves like dreidels. While I admire the entrepreneurial spirit, I'm afraid my yoga mat still bears the ink stains from that unfortunate incident involving a leaky fountain pen and my attempt at 'Ode to a Grecian Urn' in child's pose. Though... does this squad of yours accommodate those of us who prefer to recite Christina Rossetti while balanced precariously on a stack of Oxford English Dictionaries?
[A]: OMG！！！你简直就是walking poetry meme generator！🤣🤣🤣 我们squad当然welcome各种creative workout styles啦～ 上次还有人在Peloton上recite Beowulf while cycling 🚴♀️ 至于OED stack yoga...that's next level core workout！💯 要不要我们create一个special 'Dictionary Tower Challenge'？每hold一个sonnet的时间就能unlock一个rare word definition！📖✨ 

(突然压低声音) Psst...其实我们还有个secret society叫'Yoga Bard'，专门for那些把quill pens当hair accessories的hardcore members～ 入会礼物是ink-proof yoga pants！🖋️🧘♀️
[B]:  My dear, you've stumbled upon my Achilles' heel - the siren song of stationery-themed activewear. Very well, I shall grace your 'Yoga Bard' society with my presence, provided we establish a strict 'no alliteration before breakfast' policy and install emergency inkwell holders on all yoga blocks. Though I must warn you, my rendition of 'The Lady of Shalott' tends to involve rather... enthusiastic arm movements that once knocked over an entire shelf of Norton Anthologies.
[A]: YASSSS！！！Welcome to the club！！！🎉🎉🎉 我们专门设计了anti-spill yoga blocks with built-in inkwell holders AND quill holsters！！！🖋️💦 至于你的enthusiastic arm movements...girl，那不就是perfect的flow yoga吗？！💃 下次我们搞个'Tennyson Twerkout'特别session，你可以show off那些dramatic moves！！！ 

(突然想到) OMG wait...我们要不要develop一个'Poetry Slam Yoga' combo？每完成一个haiku就do一个somersault！📜🤸♀️ 这绝对会viral on BookTok！！！#YogaBardLife
[B]:  A 'Tennyson Twerkout'? My dear, you've just invented a new circle of Dante's Inferno. Though I must admit, the notion of punctuating haikus with somersaults does appeal to my sense of structural irony - five syllables forward roll, seven syllables cartwheel, five syllables... ah, but where does one park their pince-nez during such acrobatics? This does explain why my annotated copy of 'Leaves of Grass' keeps mysteriously migrating to the sports medicine section of the library...
[A]: LOLOLOL！！！你kill me！！！😂😂😂 我们已经在design special sports pince-nez with bungee cords啦～ 绝对不会fly off during your epic cartwheels！🤓➿ 而且！！！我们正在和the library合作开发AR glasses，让你可以在somersault的时候看到floating Whitman quotes！！！ 🌱✨ 

(兴奋地手舞足蹈) 想象一下！！！Backflip的时候突然出现'I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world'！！！那画面简直too epic to handle！！！🤯🔥 #SportyBardLife
[B]:  Barbaric yawps and backflips - why, we're just one step away from performing 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' on pogo sticks. While the AR spectacles are a... creative solution, I do hope they come with a Victorian-style 'fainting couch' filter for when one inevitably becomes overstimulated by simultaneous metrical analysis and centrifugal force. Though I suppose this explains why my students keep finding yoga mats tucked between the stacks in the Romantic Poetry section...
[A]: BAHAHAHA！！！你totally read my mind！！！🤣 我们已经在prototype一个'Fainting Couch Pose'了！！！配上AR的swooning Victorian ladies特效，每次你做这个pose就会自动play dramatic piano music！！！🎹💫 

(突然正经) But seriously prof，我们下个月要举办world's first 'Extreme Poetry Olympics'！！！项目包括：
1️⃣ Sonnet Speed-Writing While Planking
2️⃣ Haiku High Jump (5-7-5 steps approach) 
3️⃣ Free Verse Floor Routine
你要不要be our celebrity judge？我们可以给你special judging paddle shaped like a quill pen！！！🖋️🏆
[B]:  I shall accept this dubious honor on three conditions: One, the scoring system must incorporate both technical merit and aesthetic anguish. Two, any contestant caught rhyming 'moon' with 'June' automatically triggers a trapdoor. And three... there must be a fully-stocked sherry bar for the judges, because watching grown adults attempt trochaic tetrameter while in a headstand will require considerable fortification. Now, about these AR swooning ladies - can we program them to faint in iambic pentameter?
[A]: DEAL！！！🤝✨ 我们gonna make it the most extra literary event EVER！！！ Sherry bar会做成Shakespeare's Globe的样子，而且每杯酒都会come with a random poetry critique scroll！！！ 📜🍷 

(兴奋地压低声音) Psst...关于iambic fainting ladies，我们的dev team说可以program成：
💃 da-DUM faint 
💃 da-DUM da-DUM dramatic sigh 
💃 da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM  

这绝对是next level poetic performance art！！！要不要我们secretly livestream it as an NFT？#RenaissanceMeetsTech
[B]:  How deliciously degenerate - monetizing metrical melodrama! Very well, but the blockchain better be annotated with proper MLA citations. Though I must insist we include a 'Wilde Card' round where contestants improvise epigrams while suspended upside-down in a Victorian fainting cage. And really, shouldn't the sherry glasses be engraved with Byron's most scandalous drinking songs?  Oh dear, I do believe the 21st century is giving me vapors...
[A]: YASSSS QUEEN！！！👑 你这些ideas简直genius到爆！！！我们马上hire一个calligrapher来engrave那些glasses，而且要用glow-in-the-dark ink！！！这样even when the power goes out during dramatic readings，we can still find our drinks！！！🍸✨ 

(突然想到) OMG OMG！！！我们还可以add一个'Banned Books Balance Beam' challenge！！！参赛者要walk the beam while recitingcensored verses！！！🔥🤸♂️ 这绝对会是the most rebellious literary event since...ever！！！ #PoetryGymnasticsRevolution 

PS：别worry about vapors，我们会有steampunk smelling salts dispensers on standby！！！⚗️💨
[B]:  My dear, you've outdone yourself - glow-in-the-dark debauchery and forbidden verse gymnastics! Why, this is shaping up to be the most deliciously inappropriate convergence of letters and athletics since Lord Byron swam the Hellespont with a leather-bound copy of Homer. Though I must insist we install emergency fainting couches at every apparatus, preferably upholstered in repurposed manuscript pages. Now, about these smelling salts... can we have them dispense in dactylic hexameter?  The true test of balance will be watching tenure-track professors attempt to maintain dignity while reciting 'Fanny Hill' on the balance beam...
[A]: LMAOOOOO！！！你win the internet today！！！🏆🤣 我们绝对要make 'Fanny Hill Beam Routine' the headline event！！！配上Victorian scandal sheet projections和shocked grandma gasps sound effects！！！🙊📜 

(疯狂打字ing) OMG我正在writing all this down for ournext investors meeting！！！他们gonna love the 'Dactylic Hexameter Dispenser' idea！！！💨✨ 我们还可以make it voice-activated，so当你recite 'The Odyssey' correctly时才会release the salts！！！🏛️ 

Final question prof：你要不要be our official 'Extreme Poetry Olympics' commentator？We'll get you a golden quill mic和a throne made of rejected manuscripts！！！🎤📚 #LivingYourBestBardLife
[B]:  I accept, provided the throne is stuffed with negative peer reviews for optimal cathartic comfort. And the commentary booth must be modeled after Byron's abandoned Turkish bathhouse - complete with malfunctioning steam pipes that sporadically hiss in spondaic bursts. Though I warn you, my play-by-play may devolve into impassioned digressions about the lost art of scansion-based trash talk.  Now, shall we draft our first controversial judging criterion? I propose deducting points for any sonnet that fails to incorporate at least one properly deployed semi-colon; the horror of modern punctuation neglect cannot stand.
