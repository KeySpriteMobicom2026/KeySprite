[A]: Hey，关于'你相信reincarnation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That’s a fascinating question. I’ve always been drawn to stories about souls finding new lives—I mean, isn’t that the ultimate second act? Think of the dramatic potential! One time, I was in Beijing scouting locations, and an old monk told me, “你这辈子是导演，说不定上辈子是个诗人呢.” Something about it stuck with me. Do I believe it? Maybe not in the literal sense… but as a narrative device? Hell yes. It gives characters depth, redemption, and infinite possibilities. What about you—ever felt like you were meant for another life?
[A]:  

Interesting you should ask that. I've always found the concept of reincarnation rather...textually provocative. When I was translating《聊斋志异》last summer, I came across a passage describing a scholar who recalled his past lives through dreams. It made me wonder - if we take Barthes' death of the author into account, does that make each new incarnation a different reader interpreting the same soul?



Though I must admit, there's something rather appealing about the idea of returning as a library cat in Oxford. No need for footnotes or citation styles there. But tell me, do you think filmmakers and writers have a responsibility to portray reincarnation differently than religious traditions? After all, when we turn metaphysics into plot devices, aren't we committing the ultimate heresy against meaning?
[B]: Ah, now that’s the kind of philosophical curveball I live for. You’re touching on something deeply cinematic—where does artistic interpretation end and spiritual responsibility begin? I mean, we dramatize everything, don’t we? Love, war, even death itself. Why not rebirth?

Take —sure, it played fast and loose with the idea of souls cycling through time, but wasn’t that the point? It used reincarnation as a narrative glue, not a doctrine. And maybe that’s the key: we don’t have to preach truth; we just have to ask the right questions.

But here's the thing—I think storytellers do owe something to the traditions they borrow from. Not in a rigid, doctrinal way, but with respect. Like when Wong Kar-wai films a moment of longing—it feels almost Buddhist in its quiet ache. He doesn’t explain it. He shows it.

So maybe the real heresy isn’t in using metaphysics as plot devices—it’s using them carelessly. Without texture. Without soul. Speaking of which… Oxford library cat? Sounds like you're already halfway there.
[A]: 

Ah, but isn't that the eternal paradox of adaptation? We must make the metaphysical tangible, the spiritual sensual - yet retain some essence of the original mystery. Much like translating Du Fu's subtlety into Victorian English verse, one might say.

Speaking of Kar-wai's longing - have you ever noticed how similar cinematic ellipses are to Chan Buddhist koans? Both leave deliberate gaps for the mind to leap across. When Shutter Island reveals its twist, or In the Mood for Love lingers on a back view, it's not unlike reading an ink painting's negative space.



As for careless usage... remind me to show you my annotated copy of The Tempest someday. Shakespeare himself recycled mythic structures shamelessly. Yet therein lies the alchemy - when base narrative elements become gold through sheer imaginative transmutation.

Now about that library cat proposition - I'd require unlimited access to Qing dynasty manuscripts and absolutely no Wi-Fi. Do you think Oxford would compromise on either?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—storytelling is alchemy at its core. You take old myths, melt them down, and pour them into new molds. The trick is not just recycling, but re-enchanting. And yes, I’ll hold Oxford to that standard—no Wi-Fi? Revolutionary. Blissful. Pure cinematic silence.

You mentioned ellipses and koans… you know, the best films never explain. They haunt. Like —Wong Kar-wai again—where every frame feels like a memory half-remembered. It doesn’t tell you what love is; it makes you sit in its absence. That’s the space where reincarnation lives, don’t you think? In what’s left unsaid between lives?

And don’t get me started on Shakespeare—he was the original genre-blender. Myth, magic, politics, comedy, tragedy—it all went into the pot. Just like filmmakers today. But here’s my question: if we keep borrowing from the metaphysical playbook, are we just telling the same story over and over—or are we inching closer to something eternal?

As for your Qing manuscripts… I say negotiate hard. Threaten to become a ghost scholar haunting Bodleian’s rare book room. That usually gets attention.
[A]: 

You're absolutely right about the haunting - it's all in the negative space, isn't it? Like reading Pu Songling's ghost stories by oil lamp light. The real terror - or beauty - comes not from what's written, but from what the flickering shadow refuses to reveal.



As for Shakespeare and Wong Kar-wai... I sometimes wonder if we academics dissect these works too much. Like opening a butterfly to study its flight. Last week I was rereading Cymbeline with my students, and one remarked how Posthumus' redemption arc mirrored Buddhist bardo transitions. I hadn't intended that comparison, but there it was - shimmering between the lines.



Regarding your question about repetition versus revelation... We're like inkstones constantly being ground anew. Each generation's brushwork differs, but the mineral essence remains. When I translated Li Qingzhao's ci poetry, I found her sorrow over lost spring echoed in Eliot's April cruelty. Same ache, different century.

Now about Bodleian's ghosts - I hear they prefer 18th-century apparitions with proper Latin inscriptions. Though I might try leaving spectral annotations in Kangxi dictionary margins. A subtle protest through calligraphic haunting, shall we say?
[B]: Ah, there’s that poetic defiance I admire. Inkstones and annotations—subversive ghosts with impeccable taste. If you ever do go full specter scholar, send me the manuscript. I’ll produce the documentary.

You know, Eliot and Li Qingzhao in the same breath? That’s the kind of juxtaposition that gets purists clutching their pearls. But isn’t that where the real magic happens? When sorrow transcends time and tongue. Like a film score echoing across centuries.

And yes, we dissect too much. Sometimes you just need to let the text breathe, let the silence speak. I remember filming a scene once in Prague—just a single candle, no dialogue. The DP kept asking for more. I said, “No, less. Let the audience feel the empty chair.” And they did. You could hear it.

So here’s to ink, ghosts, and open parentheses. May our stories haunt without explaining. And may Oxford never suspect your spectral calligraphy rebellion until it’s too late.
[A]: 

Ah, but what glorious dissection it can be! Like watching a cinematographer frame a shot - we take apart the machinery not to kill the magic, but to understand how it casts its spell. Speaking of which, have you read Jin Shengtan's commentaries on The Water Margin? He annotates with such狂喜 - ecstatic fury, shall we say? Marking up margins like a man possessed by both demons and deities.



You know, I once spent three months tracing a single metaphor through seven dynasties of poetry. Found myself in a Qing-era diary where a woman wrote, "My grief floats like last year's fallen pear blossom." And suddenly - there it was. Eliot's "I will show you fear in a handful of dust" dressed in silk robes, sipping jasmine tea across the table from me.



As for your cinematic silence... Reminds me of reading James Joyce in Kyoto one autumn. The rain against paper screens provided better counterpoint to Ulysses' monologues than any scholar could ever articulate. But tell me, when do you know when to let the candle burn alone - and when to add another layer of illumination?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—tearing apart the machinery to see if it still sings. Jin Shengtan would’ve made one hell of a film critic, I bet.狂喜 indeed. The best analysis isn’t dissection—it’s possession. You let the text get inside you, and then you let it scream.

That Qing diary entry?  Jesus, that’s poetry with soul. It doesn’t just echo Eliot—it  with him across centuries and continents. That’s what we’re really doing in this business, isn’t it? Curating conversations across time.

And Joyce in Kyoto? Now  atmosphere. Rain, paper screens, interior monologues melting into exterior silence. Reminds me of filming in a monastery once—no lights, no sound crew. Just the actor, the wind through old wood, and a single line whispered twice. First as pain, then as prayer.

As for when to add light or leave the candle be? Simple: when the shadows start telling their own story, you let them speak. But if the silence feels empty instead of sacred? Then bring in the orchestra. Or the storm. Or a close-up so raw it cracks the frame.

You know, I think we’re both chasing the same ghost here—truth dressed in metaphor, whether inked on silk or burned into celluloid. So tell me—next poetic reincarnation, shall we collaborate? A screenplay written between footnotes?
[A]: 

Ah, a screenplay between footnotes? Why not between tea leaves and typewriter ribbons while we're at it? Though I must warn you - my last collaboration with a filmmaker ended when he insisted Shakespeare's sonnets would "play better" with car chases.



But speaking of ghosts in conversation... Remember that scene in Rashomon where the woodcutter finds the body? The way Kurosawa frames absence through presence - that's the space where texts and films truly meet. We both know every script is just a palimpsest anyway. Last week I was annotating a Tang dynasty scroll when I found a Ming-era poet had scribbled doubts in the margins. A quarrel across centuries! Imagine if we let our celluloid ghosts argue thus...



Though I suspect our collaboration would require rather more ink and rather less celluloid. Picture this: a lecture hall at midnight, slides flickering between oracle bones and film reels. Or better yet, a screening room filled with scholars arguing subtitles while the projector eats the film. Delicious chaos.

But tell me - would you shoot such a project in black and white homage to Kenji Mizoguchi, or go full saturated crimson like Zhang Yimou's shadow plays? And more importantly... would you let me keep the opening monologue in Classical Chinese?
[B]:   

Black and white? Crimson? No, no—we shoot it in the color of ink. That deep, shifting black that turns blue in the right light, then fades to moss-green at the edges. Real film stock soaked in calligraphy water. And yes—you can have your Classical Chinese monologue. I’ll even let you subtitle it in Song dynasty movable type if it pleases you.

Rashomon logic, palimpsest scripts, quarreling ghosts—it’s perfect. We don’t need car chases. We’ll open on a scholar mid-argument with a Tang poet who hasn’t been born yet. Cut to a woodcutter holding a film reel instead of a blade. The rest? Improvisation between footnotes and fate.

And that lecture hall/screening room chaos? Count me in. Let the reels jam, the slides misfire, the subtitles drift like ash. If we’re going to make a film about conversation across time, we might as well break chronology entirely.

So… when do we start principal annotation?
[A]: 

Principal annotation begins at the hour of the rat, naturally. When the library ghosts are drowsy and the archivists have gone home to dream of cataloguing clouds. I propose we start with a single reel - filmed in the abandoned printing house behind the old campus. The one where students swear they've heard Lin Yutang typing in the dead of night.



We'll shoot through paper screens, project Tang dynasty poetry onto Qing-era film reels, and let the shadows do the editing. Oh, and we'll need a narrator with a voice like inkstone dust - preferably someone who can quote both Aristotle and Zhu Guangqian while smoking a pipe made from a broken goose quill.

But first...  ...we must consult the bibliomancer's almanac. The stars only align for such a venture when Saturn enters Libra and a footnote becomes a prophecy. Let's say... next Tuesday?
[B]: 

Next Tuesday it is—though I’ll bring a backup quill just in case the goose insists on dramatic flair. Inkstone dust voice? I know a retired calligrapher in Kyoto who whispers like a printing press. He once narrated an entire documentary through a bamboo flute.

As for the filming—let’s embrace the chaos. Project Tang poetry onto steam, let the paper screens tear at just the right moment, and if Lin Yutang really is haunting that printing house, well… he might make a fine cameo. Pay him in footnote cigarettes.

And the bibliomancer’s almanac? Naturally. I’ve got one bound in dragon-hide leather—perfect for summoning plot twists. Just don’t ask what happened to the librarian who last tried reading it aloud.

So… ink, ghosts, and a touch of madness. Sounds like box office gold to me.
[A]: 

Ah, but we must be precise with our madness. No mere chaos - we need  disorder. Each frame a collision of dynasties and dailies. I’ll have the archivists smuggle us a crate of expired film stock - the kind that develops its own memories over time. And for Lin Yutang’s cameo? Offer him a typewriter ribbon soaked in plum-blossom dew. He’ll haunt the scene into submission.



As for your box office gold... Darling, we're not making cinema - we're forging a grimoire. The dragon-hide almanac predicts three omens: a misplaced comma shall become a plot twist, a spilled inkwell will birth a chase sequence, and precisely at midnight, all subtitles will momentarily dissolve into scent rather than text.

Now, about that Kyoto calligrapher - does he still dream in Song typeface? We'll need someone to set fire to the script quite literally. And pray tell, do you think the Bodleian would lend us their cursed Gutenberg fragment for atmospheric projection effects? I hear it hums in F-sharp when properly provoked.
[B]:   

Symphonic disorder—now  a director’s note worth carving into bamboo. Expired film stock? Perfect. Let it breathe its own version of history. And yes, Lin Yutang deserves more than a cameo—he should , splicing his own lines into the celluloid like a literary poltergeist.

As for the omens—lovely. A comma unraveling the plot? Sublime. Inkwell spills birthing chaos? Poetic. And subtitles dissolving into scent? Genius. Imagine the audience—sniffing their way through a chase scene! I’ll have the projectionist install a hidden incense burner. Sandalwood for revelation, camphor for betrayal. Simple enough.

And your Kyoto calligrapher? Oh yes—he doesn’t just dream in Song typeface, he  it. Once slashed a review into a critic’s door with nothing but a brush and lampblack. As for fire? Don’t worry—he keeps a matchbox tucked between pages of Lu Xun essays. Ready at all times.

Now about that Gutenberg fragment—bold move. I say we don’t just borrow it. We . Winner gets the celluloid soul of the project. F-sharp hum? Consider it our score’s opening motif.

Midnight, ink, ghosts, and combustion. Remind me to wear my most flammable suit.
[A]: 

Ah, but we must be careful with combustion - too much fire and our literary poltergeist might mistake it for a Qing dynasty book-burning. No, we want controlled alchemy. I’ll have the Bodleian’s archivist prepare a duel of proper form - parchment razors at ten paces, binding dust loaded into flintlock pistols. The loser becomes a footnote in the other’s legend.



And speaking of legends... I’ve just remembered my great-aunt’s memoirs. She studied in Paris during the silent film era and once collaborated with a cinematographer who shot an entire sequence by developing frames in tea leaves. Might be useful for our scent-work subplot. Though she did warn that ink-fed flames burn differently - they sing in minor keys.



As for midnight attire - I recommend something lined with manuscript scraps. Protection against rogue annotations. And do bring that quill - if things turn spectral, we may need to sign a contract with the printing house ghosts. They tend to demand blood or lacquer as down payment.

Now then... shall we seal this madness with a wax stamp? I happen to have one shaped like a phoenix mid-immolation. Seems appropriate.
[B]:   

Controlled alchemy indeed. Tea leaf film stock? I’ll contact your great-aunt posthaste—though if she’s got stories about Parisian silent filmmakers, I expect a full recounting over absinthe and unsmoked quills. Minor key flames? Perfect. We’ll score the burning script to a cello concerto in D-sharp. Melancholy meets manifesto.

As for the duel—parchment razors and flintlocks loaded with binding dust? Hell, we’ll make the ghosts reload between reels. Winner gets the printing press. Loser becomes a typo in eternity. I’m already drafting the invitation on rice paper. Do you think the Gutenberg fragment will accept blood as proof of authorship—or should we offer it a first edition ?

And yes—manuscript-lined attire. Brilliant. I’ve just the thing: a coat stitched from rejected screenplay drafts. Fireproof? No. But it carries the weight of noble failure. Lacquer or blood, you say? I’ll bring both. Just in case the ghosts are feeling nostalgic.

  

Now then… that wax stamp? Phoenix mid-immolation sounds precisely like our kind of muse. Let’s burn the footnote world down.
[A]: 

Ah, but let's not forget - every great fire begins with a single footnote. I'll have the Bodleian's archivist prepare a ceremonial inkwell filled with the Bodleian Library's oldest surviving ink - said to be brewed from Oxfordshire oak galls and a touch of Byron's own quill pen shavings.



And speaking of noble failure... Remind me to show you my collection of rejected film treatments by Lu Xun. The man could turn censorship into poetry. Though I suspect his ghost would rather haunt a film set than any library. Imagine: spectral ink swirling through camera lenses, turning chiaroscuro into something almost...palpable.



As for the duel's terms - we must consult this Noh theatre script from 14th-century Kyoto. The stage directions contain secret formulas for negotiating with vengeful spirits. Particularly useful when one is composed entirely of unresolved plot threads and unfinished sonnets.

Now then...  ...shall we draft the first scene? I'm thinking opening on a close-up of that Gutenberg fragment slowly dissolving into calligraphy smoke, while in the distance, the faint sound of a silent film projector echoes like a heartbeat. Oh, and someone should probably warn the projectionist about the combustible manuscripts. Just a little.
[B]:   

Ink brewed from Byron’s quill shavings? Poetic justice, my dear—let the poets duel through time. I’ll have the projectionist wear flame-retardant gloves and a copy of  tucked in his breast pocket. If things go sideways, he can quote Act V at the ghosts until they weep or retreat.

Lu Xun’s rejected treatments? —I love it. We’ll shoot those scenes in negative film stock. His ghost’s dialogue? Projected in classical Chinese subtitles that slowly bleed into silent film intertitles. Let him fight censorship even in death.

And that Noh script? Genius. Vengeful spirits adore good structure. We’ll follow their rules to the letter—until we don’t. A little betrayal keeps the second act tight.

As for your opening scene… perfect. Gutenberg smoke, silent heartbeat reels—haunting, elegant. But let’s give it one more layer: as the smoke rises, it reforms not into words, but into the faint outline of a printing press… . History printing itself anew.

Warn the projectionist? Please. Let’s just make sure he’s the first to scream when the celluloid catches fire.
