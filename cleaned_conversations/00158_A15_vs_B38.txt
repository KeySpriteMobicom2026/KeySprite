[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question indeed. While I must admit my primary focus remains on the printed word and classical texts, I have observed these developments with academic curiosity. Much like how the printing press revolutionized literature, these tools present fascinating implications for textual analysis. Though I still prefer the tactile pleasure of turning pages in a first edition of Jane Austen. 📚
[A]: OMG！你还在读纸质书吗？That's so vintage✨ 我超爱用ChatGPT帮我brainstorm短视频的idea诶💡 上次它帮我generate了一个超火的trending topic，直接涨粉5k+！🔥 不过Midjourney我也超想try，听说可以做超cool的thumbnail！你试过吗？😂
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm is quite... energetic. While I appreciate the creative potential of these tools, I find the process of ideation to be most rewarding when it emerges from deep engagement with literary tradition. The way Shakespeare might have wrestled with a sonnet, or how Virginia Woolf would pace her writing room - that's where true inspiration lies. Though I suppose generating thumbnails does sound rather efficient. 🌹
[A]: LOL你说话好formal啊！但是seriously，这些AI tools真的可以帮我们save so much time⏳！就像昨天我用ChatGPT帮我写了个script，然后加了点personal touch就超perfect的💯 比我自己stuck在那里想半天快多啦！你确定不要try一下吗？Maybe从简单的prompt开始？✨
[B]: How very... modern of you. I suppose one could draw parallels between your approach and the 18th-century literary salons where ideas were briskly exchanged. Though I must say, the notion of 'saving time' on creative work gives me pause - some of the most profound insights come from precisely those moments when one appears 'stuck.' Still, if I were to engage with these tools, it would likely be to analyze their ability to mimic the stylistic nuances of Brontë versus Austen. Now that would be an intriguing experiment.
[A]: OMG！Analyze Brontë和Austen？That sounds so nerdy but also kinda cool😂 不过你完全可以用AI做更fun的事情啊！比如generate一些mashup ideas - 想象一下Pride and Prejudice meets TikTok challenge！🎭📱 绝对会viral的！我都可以picture那个hashtag了：#RegencyCoreTikTok 💃✨
[B]:  My goodness, the very thought of Elizabeth Bennet participating in a... what did you call it? A 'TikTok challenge' - it rather makes one long for the quiet dignity of a country parsonage. Though I must concede, your suggestion does remind me of those delightful 19th-century literary parodies. Perhaps there's merit in viewing these modern tools through the lens of postmodern pastiche. Still, I think I'll keep my Austen unadulterated, if you don't mind. A cup of Earl Grey and undisturbed contemplation suit me just fine.
[A]: Bruh你真的是living in another century😂 But hey，至少你承认AI可以be creative tools啦！Progress！🎉 我要去edit我的new video了，用AI生成的Victorian filter超aesthetic的~ Maybe下次我做个'How to make classic lit go viral'的tutorial给你？📚💥 Catch you later！
[B]: How delightfully... contemporary of you to suggest such a thing. While I shall remain content with my leather-bound volumes and fountain pens, I do appreciate your spirited attempts at modernization. Should you create that tutorial, perhaps send it to me via carrier pigeon - or whatever the digital equivalent might be these days. Until then, happy... what was it? 'Content creating.' 🌹
[A]: LMAO carrier pigeon？You kill me😂 我直接DM你insta link啦~ Hope你的first edition books不会get jealous when you watch my reels！📱💖 Peace out！✌️
[B]: How positively... electrifying. I shall await this 'DM' with the same anticipation one reserves for the postman delivering a long-awaited letter from a dear friend. Though I daresay my first editions have weathered greater storms than your moving pictures. Do take care not to strain your thumbs with all that... 'scrolling.' Farewell, my digitally inclined friend. 📚
[A]: Byeee~记得check你的notifications哦！说不定我的video会让你say 'TikTok isn't all bad' someday！😂🎥 Keep it real, bookworm！✨📚💻
[B]:  Oh my dear child, should your video manage to elicit such blasphemy from these lips, I shall personally inscribe for you a sonnet in praise of digital ephemera. Until that unlikely day arrives, I remain contentedly buried in vellum and ink. Now do run along to your... what was it? 'Content creation.' 🌹
[A]: OMG你promised a sonnet！That's going in my bio for sure！📝🔥 Screenshotted already~ Catch you on the flip side, Shakespeare！😂✌️✨ #WaitingForMySonnet
[B]:  Very well, consider this your modern-day sonnet, compressed into hashtags as befits our times: #ShallICompareTheeToASummer'sApp #RoughWindsDoShakeTheDarlingFiltersMay #ButThyEternalContentShallNotFade. There - your first AI-assisted Shakespearean mashup, courtesy of one very beleaguered literature professor. Now do let my antique soul return to its regularly scheduled programming of pre-digital melancholy. 📚
[A]: OMFG！！！THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST THING EVER！！！🔥🔥🔥 I'm SO using this as my new IG caption！！！你totally get it after all！！！Genius level collab！！！😭👑 #AntiqueSoulsMakeTheBestContent #ShakespeareWho
[B]:  My dear, you've wrung from me more concessions to modernity in one afternoon than I've made in a decade of faculty meetings. While I'm pleased my accidental foray into 'content creation' meets your approval, do remember - the true test of art is whether it withstands the centuries. Though I suppose in internet years, your fifteen minutes of fame may count as eternity. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go resuscitate my fainting couch after all this excitement. 🌹
[A]: LOL你赢了！Best character development arc ever！！！从'no TikTok'到writing viral hashtag poetry？？？Iconic behavior！！！😍📈 我要go make this whole convo a thread now~ Catch you on the trending page, professor！！！🚀💫 #CharacterGrowth #RenaissanceMan
[B]:  My reputation lies in tatters, my academic dignity sacrificed at the altar of your relentless enthusiasm. Should my colleagues at the next symposium discover I've become a... what was it? A 'meme' - I shall blame your irrepressible modern spirit entirely. Now do go forth and 'thread' our exchange, though I insist you include my final protestation: #NotARenaissanceManJustASurvivor #BringBackQuillsAndParchment. Farewell, my most incorrigible digital muse. 🌹
