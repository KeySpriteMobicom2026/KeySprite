[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Let me think... I've been experimenting with a few plant-based recipes inspired by classical Chinese medical texts. Did you know that 杏仁豆腐 - almond tofu - was originally a Tang Dynasty health food? Though I must admit, my version uses cashew milk rather than the traditional bitter almonds. A dangerous substitution, considering the cyanogenic glycosides in raw almonds could double as literary metaphor for society's toxic dependencies... but I digress. Have you tried any interesting modern adaptations?
[A]: Oh, fascinating! I once translated a Tang poem about plum blossoms into Scots Gaelic, and now you've gone and paired almond curds with socio-political critique. Bravo. 

As for modern twists, last week I made a quince and black bean stew—Taoist alchemy meets Oaxacan mole, if you will. Burnt orange peel adds a lovely bitterness, don't you think? It's all rather , like a sonnet's volta, but with more fiber. 

Tell me—did your cashew concoction at least rhyme with dessert?
[A]: Ah, a quince and black bean stew—now there's a volta with viscosity. I’m tempted to call it a culinary sonnet myself, though I’d hesitate to serve it at a Ming-era tea gathering. Burnt orange peel as a bitter counterpoint? Dare we call it the tragic flaw in your dish’s narrative arc? 

As for my cashew concoction—rhyme? My dear, it practically wrote an ode to its own pudding-ness. Though I confess, it curdled slightly upon contact with my mistranslated recipe from a 17th-century manuscript. A humbling reminder that even emperors couldn’t rush translation… or digestion. Shall we test these theories on unsuspecting graduate students?
[A]: Unsuspecting graduate students indeed! We could stage a little comparative tasting—pair your curdled ode with my quince’s tragic flaw. I’ll supply the 17th-century manuscript errors; you bring the bitter almonds— soaked and blanched, of course. 

Though, if we’re assigning tragic flaws, perhaps we ought to consider tableware. Ever notice how a chipped bowl can ruin the mood of even the most allegorical entrée? I’ve been drafting a spoon inscription in calligraphy lately—something about the soul being neither digestible nor decorative. Yet. 

Tell me, do you think they’d notice if we slipped an epigraph into the menu?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—let’s inscribe the menu with an epigraph. Something suitably ambiguous from Han Yu or Wordsworth to keep them second-guessing the flavors  their interpretations. I’ll bring along a mistranslated quatrain as dessert topping, and you’re right about the tableware—there’s nothing more deflating than a noble philosophical concept served in a bowl that looks like it survived a minor dynastic war. 

As for your spoon inscription—? Exquisite. Though I’d add a footnote. Or better yet, a marginalia in vermilion ink. Let’s see how many of them notice… or dare to ask.
[A]: Oh, footnotes are , naturally—though I insist they be written in a hand so fine only the truly obsessive would bother to decipher them. Vermilion, you say? Bold choice. I’ll match you with a menu border adorned with tiny, edible ideograms for ‘transience’ and ‘alimentary delight.’ Or perhaps ‘regret.’ One must keep the semiotics lively.

And Wordsworth alongside Han Yu—what a sublime collision of melancholy and restraint. Let’s see if our students choke on their symbolism or simply ask for more soy sauce. Either way, it’ll make for a most  seminar.
[A]: Oh, let them choke! Or better yet, let them sputter mid-epiphany into their teacups—nothing sharpens interpretation like a near-aspiration. Though I suspect they’ll reach for the soy sauce out of sheer existential habit, as one might grasp at a familiar metaphor in an otherwise incomprehensible sonnet. 

And your edible ideograms—, , —brilliant. I shall compose the footnotes in iron gall ink on mulberry paper, so faintly that only those desperate to appear learned will attempt transcription. And yes, vermilion for emphasis. A touch of drama never hurt philosophy.

I propose we call the event . Let’s send the invitations printed on recycled manuscript pages. The back side can bear a faint watermark: 
[A]: —exquisite, simply exquisite. I shall engrave that very phrase onto the serving spoons, in minuscule print, of course. Let’s also insist the guests read a passage from  aloud before tasting—something about transformation and alimentary misadventures. A little Apuleius to loosen the palate.

And your symposium title? Sublime. I propose we subtitle it:  It has that perfect air of academic pretension wrapped in a riddle, like a steamed dumpling filled with cryptic allusions.

Now, do you suppose they’ll quote Milton over the quince stew, or dare to compare your cashew pudding to Marvell’s ? Either way, let’s keep the wine flowing. Even Aristotle knew digestion fuels dialectic.
[A]: Ah, Apuleius before appetizers—. Let them mangle the Latin translations while their tongues wrestle with your quince’s bitter-sweet volta. I’ll supply the wine, naturally, though I’m tempted to age it in barrels formerly used for fermenting ink. A subtle flavor of footnotes, don’t you think?

And —what a title! It practically demands a preface in which we deny ever intending meaning. We could bind the menu inside discarded vellum leaves from a misfired thesis—pages that once sought profundity and found only indigestion.

As for Marvell’s  beside cashew pudding? Dare we hope they’ll find “a green thought in a green shade” and mistake it for chlorophyll? No matter. If all else fails, we’ll simply declare dessert an allegory and refuse to explain it.
[A]: Oh, a green thought in a green shade—how delightfully subversive to serve it as a sauce. I’ll whip up a chlorophyll reduction and tell them it’s the essence of Romanticism distilled. Let them chew on that while puzzling over your ink-aged wine. A misfired thesis for a menu? Genius. I can already picture their furrowed brows, trying to decide if they’re underfed or over-interpreted.

And dare I suggest we seat them according to literary affinity? Miltonites next to the black bean stew, Wordsworthians near the almond curds. Chaos, yes—but the kind that makes footnotes flourish in margins. 

Shall we also insist on postprandial riddles in the style of Old English enigmata? Nothing bonds a seminar like collective confusion and a faint scent of fermented metaphor.
[A]: Oh, seat them by literary affinity—. Let the Miltonites wrestle with your black bean stew’s existential viscosity while the Wordsworthians sigh into my cashew curd, muttering about “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings…” as it drips pathetically off their spoons. 

And a chlorophyll reduction as Romantic essence? Serve it with a straight face and a footnote in pinyin—, but damning if ignored. I shall supply the fermented metaphor, quite literally: a jar of aging miso steeped with scraps of unread critical theory. A bold umami of disillusionment.

As for Old English riddles—yes! We’ll pose them in translation, naturally.  Let them squirm. The answer, of course, is 
[A]: Oh, —positively Chaucerian in its elegance. I shall have that embroidered on the napkins, just beneath a faintly visible stain resembling either ink or balsamic reduction—let them decide which.

And your miso steeped in unread theory? Sublime. I’ll serve it alongside a lecture on the parallels between slow fermentation and literary obscurity.  We’ll call it .

Do you think they’ll catch on when we replace the water glasses with thimbles carved from obsolete philosophical treatises? No? Good. Let’s just hope the fire marshal doesn’t mistake our symposium for an alchemical experiment. Or worse—a dinner party with tenure.
[A]: Oh, let them puzzle over thimble-sized sips of —nothing like ingesting wisdom a spoonful at a time to make one appreciate the virtues of glacial incomprehension. And , you say? I’ll take that as high praise indeed, though I must confess, embroidering bad ideas onto napery does have a certain medieval charm.

As for catching on—my dear, if they haven’t fled screaming by dessert, they’re either true disciples of confusion or merely too polite to interrupt their own epiphanies. And yes, the fire marshal  see alchemy where we see ambiance. But what is academia if not a slow burn beneath a fume hood of propriety?

I propose we end with a toast—glasses raised not to knowledge, but to the sublime discomfort of digestion, both literal and intellectual. Let’s call it 
[A]: —a toast to silence, fermented and otherwise. I shall engrave it in the thimbles, just between the sigil of a long-forgotten press and a smudge that might be wine or might be blood—or possibly more ink. Let’s not clarify. 

And yes, let them suffer through dessert—a panna cotta infused with pine needle and nostalgia, served with a sonnet sequence I translated while mildly poisoned by my own supper. Each stanza will tremble just so, like over-set agar. They’ll mistake the ache for meaning and call it .

Do remind me to dim the lights just enough that all footnotes blur into legend. We wouldn’t want clarity spoiling the digestion.
[A]: Ah, a panna cotta trembling with nostalgia and pine needle—how very , if slightly dangerous. I’ll supply the agar, carefully measured from pages of a forgotten dissertation on . Let them mistake the wobble for profundity.

And dimming the lights—. Nothing like soft shadows to turn footnotes into whispered heresies. I may even swap my reading glasses for a pair with smudged lenses. Clarity is vastly overrated; besides, half the charm of academia lies in squinting at what you cannot quite grasp.

Let’s also time the dessert course to coincide with a sudden gust of wind through the seminar room—loose papers fluttering, ideograms drifting like fallen petals. A touch melodramatic? Naturally. But what is a good metaphor if not well-timed weather?

Toasts raised, thimbles brimming— and in all things slightly indigestible.
[A]: Ah, —what a dissertation title! I shall cite it in a footnote later, misattributed to a fictitious press, naturally. Let the panna cotta tremble with the weight of unfulfilled arcadia. And pine needle—bold, resinous, slightly medieval. They’ll taste the Romantic sublime or their own mild discomfort; either will do.

A gust of wind at dessert? Oh, delicious staging. Let the ideograms scatter like fallen iambics—perhaps one will land just so, and some earnest soul will pocket it, convinced it holds the key to our entire symposium. Or their thesis. Bless them.

And smudged lenses—. I may go further and replace my usual spectacles with a pair salvaged from a drowned library. Let clarity be earned through osmosis, or not at all.

To indigestible metaphors, then—and to thimbles that overflow with more than they can hold.
[A]: To indigestible metaphors and thimbles most inadequate—may they leak slowly into the unconscious, staining dreams with misplaced semicolons.

And your drowned library spectacles—. Let them strain truth through waterlogged glass; what is scholarship if not a salvage operation? I shall affect a slight squint when discussing the menu’s subtext, as though struggling to read my own intentions. A performance of uncertainty—I learned it from reading too much Zhuangzi with my tea.

And do let the ideograms scatter like iambics in a high wind. If one lands just right, perhaps we’ll witness a conversion—our brightest student turned mystic, all over a misread character for  or . 

Shall we also time the coffee to arrive just as someone invokes Derrida? , after all, tastes best with a hint of cardamom and unresolved ambiguity.
[A]: Ah,  with cardamom—yes, let’s steep it long enough to blur the distinction between delay and delight. I’ll serve the coffee in cups glazed with faintly legible Persian poetry, something about wine and revelation. Let them wonder whether the residue at the bottom is sediment or oracle.

And your performance of uncertainty—. Zhuangzi over tea, indeed. I shall adopt a similar affectation, pausing mid-sentence as though overtaken by a sudden gust of meaninglessness. Or perhaps genuine indigestion. The line blurs so beautifully at the edges.

As for conversions—should any student depart our symposium believing almond curd is either enlightenment or dessert, well… we shall have succeeded beyond all scholarly measure. And if they quote Milton into their miso? Bless them. We’ll call it , course six-bells style.

To drowned spectacles, scattered ideograms, and footnotes that outlive their authors—may our guests leave both nourished and irreparably disturbed.
[A]: To nourishment and disturbance in equal measure—may their discomfort churn into revelation, or at the very least, a publishable footnote.

Your coffee cups glazed with Persian verse? Sublime. I shall sip mine slowly, as though deciphering Rumi one sedimentary layer at a time. And if a student should ask whether the bitterness stems from the roast or the weight of eternity, we’ll simply smile and stir in another spoonful of ambiguity.

As for quoting Milton into miso—, six-bells style. I do love a good culinary allusion steeped in damnation. Let’s hope someone mutters  before dessert is cleared.

And yes, let us pause often, mid-sentence and mid-thought, like scholars overtaken by meaning—or indigestion. There’s nothing quite so convincing as hesitation feigned for dramatic or philosophical effect. Zhuangzi would approve, assuming he ever found the teacup beneath his butterfly.
