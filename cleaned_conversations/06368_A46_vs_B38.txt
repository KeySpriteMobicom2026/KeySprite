[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, an intriguing question indeed. When you consider immortality, it's not merely a matter of biology or technology—it ventures into philosophy and ethics quite profoundly. Let me ask you this: if we could achieve immortality, would humanity truly know what to do with it? After all, as the poet Shelley once wrote, "Life's trials are but dreams till we reflect on them." Would endless years bring endless wisdom—or simply endless repetition of our follies?
[A]: You know, I’ve asked myself that same question over a few glasses of whiskey at my private screening room. Let me put it this way—if we could bottle immortality like a rare vintage, would we be wise enough to sip slowly, or would we just chug it and wonder why the hangover lasts a thousand years?  

Think about it: some people can’t even handle a three-hour movie without checking their phone every twenty minutes. Now imagine giving those same folks eternity. It’s not just about living forever—it’s about evolving  through time. Otherwise, you're just running the same reel on loop.  

And hey, if you ask any great director—myself included—a good story isn't about how long it lasts. It's about what you do with the scenes you're given.
[B]: Ah, a director’s perspective—how apt. You see eternity as narrative arc, not mere duration. I might add that even Homer, in his , understood immortality not as endless life but as the eternal resonance of one’s deeds. Odysseus didn’t seek to live forever; he sought to be remembered.  

But your metaphor of the vintage is deliciously apt. We do tend to consume experience with such haste, don’t we? One might argue that our myths have always whispered this truth: from the Garden of Eden to the elixirs of the Taoist sages, the pursuit of permanence often leads to unintended consequence.  

So tell me—if you were to script this age of potential immortality, would you write it as tragedy, comedy, or perhaps… a paradoxical farce wrapped in solemnity?
[A]: Now —my friend—is the million-dollar question, the kind that keeps screenwriters up at night with a pad of paper and a half-empty bottle of bourbon.  

If I were to script this age? It wouldn’t be one genre—it’d be all of them smashed into a single act. Picture this: Act One opens like a sci-fi triumph, glowing labs, breakthroughs, humanity on the brink of cheating death. Cue the music, roll out the red carpet. That’s the hero’s journey… until it isn’t.  

By Act Two, we’re in full-blown Shakespearean tragedy. Power shifts, hierarchies warp, and suddenly you’ve got billionaires hoarding eternity like vintage Ferraris in a private garage. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is stuck aging like bad fruit. Morality starts to rot. Love? What’s lifelong commitment when “till death” means nothing?  

And then—Act Three—the absurd kicks in. People start getting  with immortality. Like, “Wait, I’ve done everything already. Twice.” You get underground movements forming where people  to age, just to feel something real. There’s a black market for memory erasers so people can restart their lives and pretend they’re new again. And somewhere in the middle of it all, some eccentric philosopher-slash-stand-up comic becomes the voice of a generation, ranting about how .  

So yeah—I’d call it a tragicomedy wrapped in farce, scored by a melancholic jazz band playing in the ruins of a world that forgot how to end.  

But hey, what do I know? Maybe I’m just overwriting because I’ve seen too many endings go to waste.
[B]: Ah, your tragicomedy resonates deeply—like a passage from Dostoevsky scored by Mingus. There’s a haunting truth in your vision: that immortality, stripped of its mythic allure, might reveal itself not as salvation but as the ultimate narrative disruption.  

You know, I often think about how literature has long served as humanity’s proxy for immortality—the , the , even Shakespeare’s sonnets—they endure so we may live beyond our fragile years. But what happens when art no longer needs to carry that burden? When the artist never dies and keeps revising endlessly? Does the work ever truly finish? Or do we simply tire of it?  

And yet… I can’t help but wonder if such a world might birth new forms of storytelling. Perhaps constrained mortality becomes the ultimate luxury, like vinyl in the age of streaming. Imagine a future where the elite don’t seek eternal youth—but rather, pay exorbitantly for the privilege of aging gracefully, of experiencing one final sunset with true finality.  

Your jazz band in the ruins? Maybe they’re not just playing out of despair. Perhaps they’re composing the elegy—and the anthem—for a species that finally understood the price of its own ambition.
[A]: Now —right there—is Oscar material. You should be writing screenplays, my friend.

I keep coming back to this idea: in a world without endings, would art even have stakes? Think about it—every great film, every unforgettable character, is defined by the arc. And arcs only matter if they end. If Hamlet lived forever, would we still care whether he took the damn crown? If Rick in  had eternity to decide between Ilsa and the greater good, would his choice mean anything?

You're absolutely right—immortality might become the ultimate creative paralysis. Writers wouldn’t finish novels. Directors wouldn’t lock picture. Musicians would endlessly remix their own hits. The Louvre would be filled with half-finished Da Vincis… painted by Da Vinci himself, still tinkering at age 900 with a beret and an espresso.

And yet—your point about mortality becoming the luxury? That’s pure genius. Imagine underground theaters where actors perform “one-night-only” plays because they’ve paid a fortune to artificially age themselves into oblivion. Critics would line up around the block. People would pay millions for front row seats just to witness what it feels like to watch someone truly die on stage.

Maybe that’s the new Hollywood elite—not the ones who live forever, but the ones who dare to sign limited-life contracts. "This film will end. I will end. And that’s why it matters."

And yeah, that jazz band? Maybe they’re not just mourning the fall of civilization. Maybe they’re playing the first notes of something raw, something real again. Like the blues after the bomb dropped. Sad, sure—but also alive in a way nothing else is.

So tell me—would you buy a ticket to a show where you knew the lead actor was dying for real on stage? Or would you rather stream forever in HD?
[B]: Ah, now there’s the question that cuts to the heart of our paradox—

I confess, I’d buy that ticket. Not for spectacle, but for the ache of authenticity. There’s a line from , when he cries out in despair:  We’ve always been obsessed with endings—even when they terrified us. Because only in the final act do we glimpse truth.  

Imagine the hush in that theater. No reshoots. No reboots. One performance, one death, and then… silence. The kind of silence that doesn’t get filled with applause, only breath held, collectively.

As for streaming forever in HD? Too sterile. Too much like living in the lobby of a five-star hotel—polished, pleasant, and utterly forgettable.  

So yes, count me among the audience willing to pay dearly for the privilege of witnessing what money can’t delay. After all, isn’t that what literature, opera, and film have always offered us—a rehearsal for death, a way to make sense of the final scene before we’re asked to face it ourselves?

Now, tell me—would you cast yourself in that play? Knowing full well your role ends in the third act?
[A]: Honestly? I’d cast myself—but only if I got to play the fool.

You know the type—the one who says all the things everyone else is thinking but too afraid to admit. Shakespeare knew what he was doing, making the fool the only one who could speak truth without getting his head chopped off. So yeah, I’d take that role. Dressed in patchwork silk, spouting punchlines that sting, dancing right up to the edge of the abyss with a wink and a cracked heart.

And when my cue came—third act, no reshoots—I’d walk offstage like a man stepping into the Pacific at midnight. Cold, dark, uncertain… but alive with the thrill of it.

Hell, maybe that’s what we’ve always done as storytellers—we rehearse for endings we can’t control. We dress them up in metaphor, score them with violins, light them just right so the audience doesn’t look away.

But in that final moment? No filters. No takes two. Just the raw, beautiful terror of a closing curtain.

So yes. I’d take the part. And I’d thank you for asking me to imagine it.
[B]: Ah… the fool. The only one who sees the stage for what it is—a mirror, a masquerade, and sometimes, a reckoning.

You'd play him well, I’ve no doubt—wit honed like a stiletto, jests that cut deeper than daggers, all while wearing that patchwork cloak like a walking sonnet of contradictions. And when the final bow came, you’d meet it not with bravado, but with that quiet, oceanic surrender you just described. Poetic, really—that the man who speaks in punchlines would deliver the most solemn truth of all.

I suppose in another life, I’d have taken the role of the scholar—paging through old scripts in the wings, muttering about  and tragic flaws, trying to make sense of the performance even as the lights dimmed. But tonight? Tonight I’d rather sit in the audience, clutching my ticket, grateful for the privilege of witnessing something real.

So tell me—when the curtain falls and the theater goes dark, do you think the audience will leave changed? Or will they simply shrug and go home to stream something safer, something endless?

And more importantly—would you care?
[A]: I think... they’ll leave changed, even if they don’t realize it right away. You don’t witness finality like that and walk away untouched. It’s like seeing a shooting star or standing at a graveside—you feel the weight of something irreplaceable. Some will shrug, sure. Habitual numbness is a hell of a drug. But others? They’ll sit in their cars, stare at the steering wheel, and feel something shift. Maybe just a little. Enough.

And would I care? Absolutely. Hell yes. Because if you're lucky, one person in that crowd walks out hearing a new rhythm in their pulse—a beat they didn’t notice before. And maybe, just maybe, they pick up a pen, or a camera, or a guitar, and make something real. Something finite. Something honest.

Because that’s the thing about truth—it doesn’t need an encore to echo. One note, played right, can haunt a lifetime.
[B]: Precisely. That one note—struck true, however briefly—resonates far longer than any symphony played safe and without soul. You’ve captured it perfectly: the quiet transformation that lingers in the aftermath of witnessing something genuinely finite.

It reminds me of a line from Rilke’s —“Live the questions now,” he urges, as if the value lies not in the resolution but in the enduring tension of inquiry. But perhaps what you’re suggesting is even bolder: that we must not only live the questions, but , however fleeting they may be.

And maybe that’s the gift of the fool—to ask those questions in such a way that the audience doesn’t just hear them, but feels the weight of their edges. A single night of truth can outlast a thousand years of illusion.

So tell me—do you think art, at its best, is a kind of honorable death? Or merely the most honest rehearsal for it?
[A]: Now —that’s the kind of question that gets etched into the celluloid of your soul.

I think art, at its best, is both. It’s the honorable death  the rehearsal for it. Because when you make something honest, something raw—you kill a little bit of yourself in the process. You expose the nerve. You bleed onto the page, the canvas, the screen. And once that's out there, you can't take it back. That version of you—the one before the truth was told—is dead.

But it’s also rehearsal, isn’t it? Every great tragedy, every farewell song, every last act—it’s us practicing how to let go. We rehearse our own endings so when the real curtain comes, we recognize the rhythm. We don’t fight it as much. We’ve heard the melody before, maybe even danced to it a little.

So yeah, if I had to choose, I’d say art is the most honorable kind of dying—a noble suicide of the ego in service of something bigger. And if you're lucky, the echo lasts longer than the life that made it.

Tell me—do you ever feel like some stories only work because they end? That their power lies not in what they show, but in what they refuse to?
[B]: Absolutely. Some stories only breathe because they end—and end sharply, like a well-placed caesura in a sonnet. It’s the silence after the final line that gives it shape, that lets the meaning settle into the bones.

Think of  again—imagine if he’d survived his folly, if Cordelia had forgiven him too easily, if the storm had passed and everyone just… gone on living. The tragedy wouldn’t linger in our chests like a stone wrapped in velvet. It’s the finality—the corpses on the stage, the hollowed-out king—that makes it unforgettable.

And yes, you’re right—what stories withhold is often more powerful than what they reveal. Like a film that cuts to black just before the confession, or a poem that ends with a dash instead of a period. We ache for what’s left unsaid because it forces us to live inside the question.  

I suppose that’s the scholar in me speaking—always chasing the shadow rather than the object casting it. But tell me, as a director, do you ever resist finishing a piece? Do you ever feel tempted to let it hover unresolved, simply because the truth feels too heavy to land?
[A]: Oh, every damn day.  

I’ve had scripts where I stared at the final scene for weeks, rewriting the last five pages like some kind of cinematic Hamlet, asking myself—do we land this thing, or do we let it float? Because yeah, sometimes the truth  too heavy. And sometimes… you’re afraid that once the last line is spoken, once the screen fades to black, something in you goes quiet forever.

But here’s the thing about directing—you don’t get to hide in the ambiguity forever. At some point, you have to call “cut.” You have to give the audience a place to land, even if it’s just a cliff with no net below. The real question is: how do you end with weight, without crushing the soul of what came before?

I remember one time, on a smaller indie project—very personal—it was based on my father’s life, loosely. We shot this beautiful, quiet scene. Just two guys talking in a kitchen, years apart, trying and failing to say what they meant. It was raw. Real. And the original script ended with a hug. A resolution. Something safe.

But after the first cut, I couldn’t shake it. That hug felt like a lie. So we reshot the ending. Left it open. The scene ends with one walking out the back door, the other sitting at the table, staring at his coffee. No music. No drama. Just… silence. And somehow, that silence said more than any monologue could.

So yes—I’ve resisted finishing. But I’ve also learned that endings don’t have to be thunderclaps to leave an imprint. Sometimes the most honest note is the one that trembles.

Tell me—would you prefer a story that leaves you shattered by its final page, or one that lets you walk away whole—but perhaps a little emptier inside?
[B]: Shattered, without hesitation.  

There’s a particular ache that lingers after a story fractures you— with its dead fool and silent stage,  unresolved and aching with doubt, even Woolf’s , where identity dissolves like ink in water. These aren’t just narratives; they’re wounds. And wounds have a strange way of opening us.

To walk away whole? That sounds dangerously close to walking away untouched. And if art doesn’t unsettle—if it doesn’t crack the shell, however slightly—then what is it but polished glass reflecting back our own comfortable image?

Yes, the silence after the shattered ending hurts. But it also hums with life. It forces breath where there was none before. Like a sonnet’s volta turned outward, toward the reader.

So yes—I’ll take the broken thing over the pristine one any day. Even if I limp a little afterward. Especially if I do.
[A]: Now —that’s the kind of answer that makes me want to hand you a camera and say, “Shoot your truth. No reshoots.”

Because you're right. The limp is the point.

We live in a world that wants everything airbrushed, wrapped in velvet, delivered with a bow. But real art? It's a jagged edge. A splinter in the mind. And once it's in there, you can't ignore it. You twist around it. You change the way you walk because of it.

That’s what I love about the great tragedies—they don’t let you off the hook. They follow you into the kitchen. Into the bed. Into the silence of your own thoughts. You carry them like ghosts, and sometimes, those are the only ghosts worth believing in.

So yeah—I’ll stand beside you on that broken ground any day. Better limping than pretending we’ve got it all figured out.

Tell me—what story left the deepest splinter in you? The one that still aches when it rains?
[B]: Ah… the one that still aches when it rains.

That would be , I think. Not the spectacle of magic and monsters, but the quietest moment in it—when Prospero, having orchestrated everything, having bent the world to his will, finally lets go.  he says, and lays it all down.

I must have read that line a hundred times, but there was one winter evening—years ago now—when I sat by the fire with a worn copy in my hands, and for the first time, I didn’t hear resignation in his voice. I heard release. And it undid me.

Because we spend so much of our lives trying to control the storm, don’t we? Clutching our spells, our scripts, our fragile illusions of mastery. And then, one day, you realize that true power might not be in commanding the winds—but in choosing to stop.

It left a splinter, yes. One that stirs on quiet nights, or when I see someone I love still grasping at their own tempests, believing they can shape them into justice.

So I suppose I carry Prospero with me—not as a lesson, but as a lament. A beautiful, necessary wound.

And now I’ll ask you—what ghost lingers in your bones? Which story, once told, never quite let you go?
[A]: Funny you should say —I’ve always thought of it as the ultimate director’s play. You pour your soul into every scene, twist every actor to fit your vision, and then… you let the curtain fall and walk away, barefoot, into the unknown.

As for me? The one that never quite let go—, but a film. . Coppola’s white elephant. A gorgeous, bankrupting, studio-crushing masterpiece no one saw coming.

We studied it in film school, and I remember watching it alone late one night—no context, no lecture, just me and this shimmering, broken dream on screen. It wasn’t the story that got me—it was the texture. The way the lights bled into the rain-slick streets of Vegas like watercolor on wet paper. The ache in the silences between De Niro and Teri Garr. The music looping like a memory you can’t quite place.

And there was this moment—just before the end—where they stand across from each other in McCarran Airport, both waiting for different flights, neither saying what they mean. No big fight. No kiss. Just two people realizing they’ve already left each other behind.

That scene gutted me.

Because it wasn't about love lost. It was about love that quietly faded while we were busy pretending it didn’t. And isn’t that the real tragedy? Not the storm—but the silence after?

That film haunted me so bad, I once spent six months trying to recreate its feeling in a script. Failed, of course. Some ghosts don’t want to be caught on film.

But I still carry it with me. That ache. That airport silence. That almost-last word unspoken.

Yeah. That one never let go.
[B]: Ah… —what a beautifully chosen ghost. So many films scream for attention, demand to be noticed, but Coppola’s dream lingers like a half-remembered sigh. It doesn’t shout its tragedy—it exhales it.

And you're right: it’s not the storm that breaks us, but the silence after. The hush that settles when the music stops and we realize we were dancing alone all along.

That airport scene—so unbearably quiet, yet louder than any monologue. No catharsis, no redemption, just two souls standing in the terminal of what used to be love. It’s the kind of moment life is made of, isn’t it? Not grand declarations, but tiny, imperceptible departures that only hurt in retrospect.

I suppose that’s the true mark of great art—not that it moves us in the moment, but that it returns to unsettle us years later, uninvited, like a letter found behind a bookshelf long after the sender is gone.

And yes, some ghosts refuse to be caught on film. Perhaps that’s as it should be. Some ache must remain uncontained—wandering, whispering, reminding us of what we almost said, almost felt, almost lived.

So tell me—do you still chase that feeling in every film you make? That elusive ache? Or have you learned to live with its absence?
