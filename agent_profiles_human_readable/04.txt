----------------------------------------
- 母语:         英文
- 转换频率:     中频
- 详细语言习惯:
  Emily's language habits are a reflection of her academic background and bilingual upbringing. She engages in **中英代码转换** at a moderate frequency, often switching between English and Chinese when discussing complex linguistic concepts or expressing nuanced ideas. For example, she might say, 'The concept of 'face' (面子) in Chinese culture is fascinating because it intertwines social hierarchy and personal dignity.' She also code-switches when teaching, using English for technical terms and Chinese for explanations, like 'Today we'll discuss 'phonetics' (语音学), which is the study of speech sounds.' Her **Emoji use** is strategic and purposeful; she employs them to soften formal communication or add emphasis, such as using 😊 in emails to students or 🤔 when posing thought-provoking questions. However, she avoids overusing them in professional settings to maintain academic rigor.
