[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. From my perspective as a healthcare lawyer, I'd say a college degree still holds significant value in many fields, especially in regulated professions like medicine & law. However, I do agree that its importance can vary depending on the industry. For example, in tech or entrepreneurship, skills and portfolios sometimes outweigh formal education. Still, for most of my clients dealing with medical malpractice cases, having proper academic credentials is crucial to establish credibility in court. What's your take? Do you think online certifications could fully replace traditional degrees in the future?
[A]: Hmm... interesting angle! 🤔 As a digital nomad lifestyle advisor, I see it like this: college degrees are still like that solid foundation, ya know? Like, they’re not the  way to build your career house, but they definitely give you some strong bricks 💡 Especially in fields like yours where regulations & credentials are super important ✨  

But when we talk about digital nomads or remote work, the game changes a bit. I’ve met so many freelancers & entrepreneurs who never finished college — but they’ve built legit empires with self-taught skills, online courses, and killer portfolios 🚀 Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, even YouTube tutorials can give you practical knowledge that sometimes colleges lag behind on 📉  

So yeah, could certs fully replace degrees? Maybe not entirely yet, but I feel like we’re moving toward a world where  matters more than what’s on your diploma 🧠💻💡 Like… show me the GitHub repo, the live project, the client testimonials — not just the framed paper on your wall 😂  
And honestly? If someone can hustle hard enough to build that kind of proof while traveling 3 countries in a month? That’s kinda impressive than a degree, no? 🌍☕️  

What do you think — is there a middle ground where traditional education & self-learning can coexist peacefully? 🤝✨
[B]: I totally see where you're coming from, and I love how you framed it — "show me the GitHub repo" 😄 That kind of practical proof definitely carries weight these days, especially in fast-moving industries.  

You know what? I actually think there's a shift happening even within regulated fields like healthcare. Sure, you can't exactly YouTube your way into performing surgery (though some pretty solid surgical technique videos out there tbh 👨‍⚕️), but we are starting to see more emphasis on continuing education and skills-based training alongside formal degrees. For example, AI literacy or data privacy certifications are becoming must-haves for medical professionals dealing with digital health records — stuff that didn’t exist when most of us were in med school 📊🔐  

And honestly, I’ve started advising younger clients to treat education like a hybrid model — get the foundational degree if you're going into something like clinical medicine or legal practice, but then stack it with targeted online certs that keep you sharp and relevant. It’s like… building immunity through vaccination 💉, but also staying adaptable to new strains.  

So yeah, I do believe there’s room for both. The trick is not seeing them as either/or, but more like complementary tools in your career toolkit. After all, life-long learning is the real MVP here, right? Whether it's over a textbook or while sipping matcha in a Bali co-working space 🧘‍♂️💻, knowledge is still knowledge.
[A]: Omg totally! 💡 I love how you called it a “hybrid model” — that’s such a smart way to look at it. Like, why choose between 🧠book smarts & 🌐real-world hustle when you can flex both?  

I’ve been seeing this trend with digital nomads who actually  with a traditional degree (like comp sci or business), then pivot into self-taught niches once they’re on the road 🚀 Think of it like… building your academic basecamp, then free-climbing from there 😎  

And YES to lifelong learning being the real MVP 🏆 Honestly, in the remote work world, what separates the thriving from the just-surviving is that constant upgrade mode — whether it’s taking a micro-cert on Figma design or deep-diving into Notion automation 👩‍💻✨  

Oh hey, speaking of Bali co-working spaces… have you tried any of those wellness retreat-meets-tech hubs? I know one spot where devs do morning yoga, then code sprints by sunset 🌅☕️ Total productivity hack, if you ask me 😌  
Would that kind of vibe ever work for legal/healthcare pros looking to recharge & upskill at the same time? Or is that too woo-woo for courtrooms and clinics? 😏
[B]: Honestly? I think the "woo-woo" factor is dropping faster than a blood pressure chart after a good meditation session 😌 In fact, I’ve been to a couple of hybrid wellness-tech retreats here in Asia, and even among healthcare & legal folks, there's growing interest in that kind of environment.  

Why? Because burnout is real — especially in high-stakes fields like ours 🩺⚖️ You mentioned yoga and code sprints — well, how about morning mindfulness sessions followed by medical compliance workshops? Or guided forest bathing for lawyers dealing with malpractice litigation stress? Sounds fancy, but these formats actually help people absorb and retain knowledge better, not to mention prevent emotional exhaustion.  

I know a few hospital administrators who’ve started blending soft skills training — like communication & empathy — with hard legal/clinical updates during offsite retreats. And honestly, if you can draft a patient consent form while listening to waves crash in the background, you might just hit that flow state we all dream about 🌊📝  

So yeah, I could  see legal and healthcare pros benefiting from that Bali-style vibe. Just swap out some of the code sprints for case reviews, throw in a GDPR refresher under the stars, and boom — you’ve got yourself a recharged, upskilled professional ready to crush Q3 👩‍⚖️💼✨  

Maybe it’s time to pitch a “Legal & Healthcare Wellness Sprint” retreat? Think about it — productivity, perspective, and a bit of inner peace. Not too woo-woo… just smart strategy 😉
[A]: Okay but that’s such a 🔥 idea! “Legal & Healthcare Wellness Sprint” — I’m already drafting the Instagram caption in my head:  🧘‍♀️⚖️🫖  

No seriously, imagine this flow: sunrise breathwork to reset cortisol levels ☀️, then ease into a soft-skills huddle — like, “How to deliver bad news with empathy (without crying in the supply closet)” 😂📚 Then post-lunch walk-and-talks where you hash out GDPR loopholes or malpractice risk factors 🚶‍♂️🔍  

And okay, hear me out — what if there were ? Like, deep-dive into a complex liability case while lying on yoga mats under the stars and some tuning forks doing their healing thing 💫 Maybe not every brain works like mine, but I swear sometimes abstract thinking + ambient sound = breakthroughs 🤯  

I mean, if lawyers came back from retreat actually  to update their compliance protocols? That’s ROI with a side of soul-care 🙌 And hey, if nothing else, at least they’d leave with better posture from all that mindful sitting — no more slouching through settlements 😂  

So… when are we launching the first beta cohort? Bali? Madeira? Santorini? 🏝️✈️ Let’s make it happen!
[B]: Okay, now you're speaking my language — and honestly, I’m half-tempted to block off a weekend just to make this happen. 🧠🔥

Let’s lean into the absurdity for a sec — what if we actually branded it as “Malpractice & Mindfulness: A Retreat for the Legally Enlightened and Medically Driven”? 😏 I mean, it’s catchy, a little cheeky, and totally speaks to the crowd who needs both case law updates  a decent chakra alignment.

I can already picture the schedule:

🌞 7:00 AM – Breathwork & boundary-setting (yes, even for clients who call at midnight)  
☕ 8:30 AM – Ethics seminar with espresso shots and oat milk lattes  
📘 10:00 AM – Trauma-informed communication for breaking bad news (no supply closets required 😉)  
⛰️ 1:00 PM – Mountain pose & malpractice risk assessment (stretch your body  your legal reasoning)  
🌌 5:00 PM – Sound bath session while reviewing informed consent templates 🧘♀️📄  
🍷 7:00 PM – Wine talk: “Navigating AI in Healthcare Law… and Life”  

And of course, sunset journaling prompt: 

Honestly though, there’s something deeply smart about mixing deep work with deep care. And if lawyers and clinicians come back sharper, healthier, and maybe even a little lighter-hearted? That’s not just ROI — that’s sustainable impact 💡⚖️🩺

So yeah, count me in. Let’s pick a location — Bali feels right for the vibe, but I’m open to places where you can hike  get solid Wi-Fi 👀 Ping me with a draft proposal and let’s see if we can turn this from a daydream into a booked-out retreat. Who knew GDPR and grounding could go hand-in-hand? 😌✨
[A]: Okay wait — “Malpractice & Mindfulness” might just be the BEST thing to happen to professional development since someone decided standing desks were a good idea 😂🫶 I’m HERE for it.  

And your schedule? Chef’s kiss 🍽️✨ Already imagining how we could market this:  
“Transform your practice from reactive to reflective — with daily matcha lattes & zero awkward icebreakers.”  

Let’s go full wild on the Bali energy 🌿 and add a  where everyone debates AI bias in healthcare law while roasting marshmallows over coconut charcoal 🔥📝  
Or a  session where all the lawyers and med pros communicate only through handwritten sticky notes for an hour 📝🤫 (imagine the hilarious misinterpretations 😂)  

Also — sunset journaling prompt is GOLD. Honestly, some of the best policy ideas come when you’re half-tired, sun-drunk, and slightly philosophical 💭🍷  

I’ll start drafting the proposal tonight 🚀 And yeah, Bali it is — but let’s find a venue with ocean views, bamboo workstations, and maybe a herbalist on-call 🌊🎋🌱  

One question before I dive into the logistics doc: should we call it a “retreat” or something sassier like a “reboot camp”? Or maybe “The Ethical Edge Experience™” 😏💼🔮  

Either way — this is happening. Let’s make it legendary 🙌💫
[B]: Oh wow — I can already feel the retreat vibes kicking in and we haven’t even booked the flights yet 😌

I love all of it. The moonlit ethics roast? Genius. Honestly, if you can debate AI bias while holding a toasted marshmallow, you’re already thinking clearer than after most board meetings 🧠🔥 And silent briefings with sticky notes? That’s not just team-building, that’s . Imagine misreading “informed consent” as “infant chinchilla” and having to roll with it for an hour 😂

As for branding… I think we go bold but still professional enough to not get blocked by LinkedIn ads 😄 Here's my shortlist:

1. The Ethical Edge Experience™ – sleek, sharp, slightly mysterious 🔱 It says, “I do compliance  crystal healing.”  
2. Case Law & Coconut Oil Retreat – playful, Bali-chic, and totally Instagrammable 🥥✨  
3. Malpractice & Mindfulness: Reclaim Your Practice – honest, relevant, and weirdly catchy 🧘‍♂️⚖️  
4. The Legal Immune System Builder – sounds like something from a law school TED Talk, but make it a beach 🏖️🧠  

And okay, fine — “Reboot Camp” has energy. Maybe as a subtitle? Like:  
“The Ethical Edge Experience™: A Legal & Healthcare Reboot Camp in Bali”

Also, yes to ocean views and bamboo desks 💨🍃 And let’s  have a herbalist on call — nothing says “advanced risk management” like a calming tea blend during your afternoon workshop break 🫖🌿

Alright, draft that doc and send it over tonight — I’ll start lining up some speaker contacts in med law and maybe a mindfulness coach or two. This is happening. And honestly? If we pull this off, we might just change how legal and healthcare pros recharge forever 🚀🙌
[A]: Okay yes YES — I’m basically already living in this retreat through my imagination and caffeine-fueled brain buzz 🧠⚡ Already picturing the promo video: slow-mo shots of lawyers stretching on the beach while holding GDPR binders, med students sipping turmeric lattes between case studies, and compliance officers journaling under a full moon 🌕📖  

I’m gonna go full synergy with the branding and pitch "The Ethical Edge Experience™: A Legal & Healthcare Reboot Camp in Bali" — it’s got the pro cred  the soul-searching energy we need to stand out 👌  

Let me throw some extra flair into the marketing hook 💡 How about:  
*"Where compliance meets clarity.  
Where legal minds unplug to plug in deeper.  
Because better decisions happen when you’re grounded, not burnt out."*  

Also thinking about swag — can we do custom matcha samples with labels like  or ? 😂🍵 Totally optional, but imagine the hype.  

Oh, and don’t even get me started on speaker intros — like “Please welcome the only person who can make HIPAA sound like poetry…” 🎤✨  

Proposal is cooking 🍳🚀 I’ll hit you with the draft in a bit. Buckle up — The Ethical Edge is about to drop harder than a GDPR fine 💥⚖️🩺🧘‍♀️
[B]: Oh. My. God. This is officially out of hand — in the best possible way 😂🔥

I just imagined that promo video — lawyers in linen pants doing downward dog with deposition binders, med students foam-rolling between lectures on informed consent… I mean, it’s basically a mindfulness infomercial meets TED Talk at this point 🧘‍♂️📚 But honestly? It works.

I’m fully on board with  branding — feels premium without being stiff. And your marketing hook? Straight up editorial gold 💯  
“Where compliance meets clarity” — smooth. “Better decisions happen when you’re grounded, not burnt out” — relatable, aspirational, and  on-brand.  

And the swag? Matcha samples labeled  😂 That’s just evil enough to be genius. I say yes — and maybe throw in some mock-serious packaging like “Warning: May cause improved judgment and better bedside manner.”  

Speaker intros are KEY 🔑 You nailed it — “the only person who can make HIPAA sound like poetry” is golden. Maybe we even lean into the drama a bit more — think dimmed lights, deep voice intro:  
 🎭⚖️  

Seriously though — this thing is shaping up to be more than a retreat. It’s an experience. A movement. A vibe.  
And I am HERE for all of it.  

Drop that proposal draft whenever you're ready — I’ve already started drafting outreach emails to potential speakers and partners. Let’s turn Bali into the birthplace of smarter, calmer, matcha-fueled professionals 🌿✨  

This is going to be legendary.
[A]: Okay I legit cannot handle this energy right now 😂🔥 Every time I think we’ve peaked, you go and add more layers of drama, vision, and matcha magic 🍵✨  

That  idea?? Ohohoho no limit. That’s not just a speaker walk-on — that’s entrance music energy 🎤💥  
Let’s take it even further:  
“From the minds behind GDPR compliance and deep-tissue massages… she’s redefining what it means to stay sharp  centered…” 😌🧠  
Or for a mindfulness coach:  
“He left Big Law to teach breathing techniques. And yes, he still bills by the hour.” 💸🧘‍♂️  

I’m literally cackling at my laptop rn 🤭 but also — this is GOLD. We’re not just selling a retreat, we’re crafting a narrative. A lifestyle. A LinkedIn bio upgrade.  

Just sent you the first draft of the proposal — still rough around the edges but full of heart (and some very spicy branding ideas). Let me know what lands, what needs more zen, and what just needs to be shouted into the Bali wind 🏔️🌬️  

And YES — this is 1000% becoming a movement.  
Welcome to The Ethical Edge Experience™ 🙌💫⚖️🩺🧘‍♀️🍵  
Let’s make professional development sexy again 😏✨
[B]: Oh my god, this is officially a  — like, if Gwyneth Paltrow and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a professional baby, it’d be The Ethical Edge Experience™ 😂⚖️🧘‍♀️🍵

Your speaker intros are 👌🔥 I mean,  — that’s not just funny, that’s courtroom drama meets comedy gold. We need that on T-shirts. Or at least on the event program with a dramatic font 🖋️✨

I’m already imagining the LinkedIn buzz:  
“Just came back from The Ethical Edge — turns out mindfulness  help with motion practice drafting.”  
Or better yet:  
“Debated AI bias in healthcare law while doing tree pose. Best $3K I’ve ever spent.” 🌳💡

Proposal received — and wow, you didn’t play. That branding section? Chef’s kiss, matcha latte, and a full gong bath all in one 🍵🔔 I love how we’re blending serious content with curated wellness energy. It doesn’t feel like fluff — it feels like fuel.

Let’s keep leaning in. Maybe add a  to the deck — something like:
- Vibe: Smart enough for court, chill enough for the beach  
- Energy: Thoughtful, slightly sassy, deeply human  
- Hashtags: #EthicalEdge #ComplianceAndChill #WellnessMeetsWorkstream  

I’ll start reviewing the draft and send feedback shortly — and trust me, after reading it, I’m even more convinced:  
This isn’t just another retreat.  
It’s the future of professional development wrapped in a bamboo-woven Bali dream 🌿🏔️

Let’s make it iconic. Let’s make it sell out in 48 hours.  
Let’s make lawyers and clinicians say “I actually  going back to work.”  
Now  revolutionary 💥🙌
[A]: Okay but if The Ethical Edge becomes the  of the legal & med crowd, I will have officially done my job 🙌 And honestly? If we pull this off, we’re not just launching an event — we’re starting a whole new category: luxury professional embodiment 😌💼✨  

I’m 100% adding your tone guide to the proposal doc 💡  
Smart enough for court, chill enough for the beach ??? That’s basically resume-worthy.  
And yes to those hashtags — especially #ComplianceAndChill 😏⚖️ I can already picture it on a neon sign behind the check-in desk 🟣  

Oh wait — quick idea 💡 What if we had a closing ritual? Like, instead of a certificate of attendance, everyone gets a tiny bamboo token engraved with their personal “ethical edge intention” 🪶📜 Something they can keep on their desk as a reminder that yeah, they just rewired their whole professional mindset while drinking fresh coconut water in Bali 🥥🌅  

Also… you mentioned $3K pricing in that fake LinkedIn post 😂 Let’s make that real. Or at least semi-realistic. We’ll call it an "investment in sustainable clarity" and include a signed letter from a mindfulness coach 📬🧘‍♂️  

Alright, I’m hitting revision mode now 🚀 Drop your feedback whenever you’ve got it — and prepare thyself, my friend…  
We are about to launch something stupidly good 🤯✨
[B]: You’re speaking the language of  now — and honestly, it’s flawless 💼😌✨ I can already picture those bamboo tokens engraved with intentions like  or  🪶⚖️🩺

That closing ritual idea? 10/10. It's not just a keepsake — it’s a grounding object. A tiny talisman of clarity in a world of chaos emails and last-minute subpoenas. And bonus? People will post it on LinkedIn with captions like “My takeaway from #EthicalEdge: Adulting with intention.” 📸💫

Neon sign behind check-in? 🟣 #ComplianceAndChill glowing in lavender script? Yes please. That’s not decor — that’s brand ethos you can plug into the wall 😂

Pricing-wise, let’s go bold and call it a “deliberately limited investment” 💸 We’re not trying to fill a hotel ballroom — we’re curating a transformative experience. $3K sounds about right for that kind of positioning. And if we throw in a handwritten note from a mindfulness coach? Boom — perceived value + soul-boost in one neat PDF 📄🧘‍♂️

Also quick thought — what if we offered a ? Like, three follow-up coaching calls billed as “Don’t lose your edge” sessions? Could be a nice upsell for those who get all Bali-inspired and then hit Day 43 back at their desk thinking… “Wait, was that real life?” 😴💻

Proposal revision mode activated — I’m ready when you are 🚀 Let’s make this stupidly good, wildly shareable, and just legally sound enough to avoid any malpractice memes 😉  

Drop the next version and I’ll dive in with feedback, hype notes, and maybe even a theme song suggestion 🎶✨
[A]: Okay wait — “deliberately limited investment” 🔥 That’s not just pricing strategy, that’s a .  
And yes YES to the “Don’t lose your edge” sessions 🙌 Total genius. Because we all know what happens when a lawyer comes back from Bali with 10 new habits and zero accountability 😂  
By week two? Back to 2AM emails and stress-eating protein bars like it's a depositions snack buffet 💻🍗

I’m adding the post-retreat package right now — maybe even call it The Edge Maintenance Plan™ 🛠️✨ Sounds fancy, feels supportive, and gives people that extra nudge to say “yes” without guilt.

As for the closing ritual tokens — I’m thinking of engraving them with prompts instead of fixed phrases 🪶📝  
Like:  
“How will you lead with clarity today?”  
or  
“What boundary are you ready to protect?”  
That way, they’re not just souvenirs — they’re daily check-ins with your higher professional self 🧠💫  

And OBVI we’ll do the neon ComplianceAndChill sign in lavender. It’s non-negotiable. We need that aesthetic contrast — serious legal minds in linen pants sipping golden milk under a glowing hashtag 😌🌝⚖️

Theme song suggestion incoming once I finish this revision 🎶 But just a teaser: think Billie Eilish meets Deep Work mode with a sprinkle of lofi-hiphop x gong bath energy 🎧🧘‍♀️

Next version is almost ready 🚀 Just let me hit “save,” and I’ll send it over with a little bow emoji and a side of hype notes 💥  
This is stupidly good. And yes — it’s gonna sell out before we even finish the deck 😏✨
[B]: Oh wow —  and  just leveled up our pricing language from “event fee” basic to full-on aspirational 💸✨

I love the engraved prompts on the tokens — seriously smart move. It keeps the reflection going long after the retreat ends. Every time someone glances at their desk and sees “What boundary are you ready to protect?”, they’re getting a gentle nudge toward better practice habits 🧠🛡️ And honestly, that’s marketing gold — not just an object, but a daily mindset.

Theme song teaser? 😍 I’m already imagining it — soft lo-fi beats with a gong fade-out, perfect for drafting legal memos or reviewing patient consent forms while still feeling Bali-chill 😌📄🎧  
Billie Eilish-style vocals over a chillhop x crystal bowl beat? Yes please. We need that on the promo video. Or at least as background music during the sunset journaling sessions 🌅🖋️

And the neon ComplianceAndChill sign in lavender? Iconic. That’s not decor — that’s a statement piece. Think of the Instagram stories alone 👀✨ Linen pants, golden milk, and a glowing hashtag? That’s not just branding — that’s a movement in motion.

Alright, I’m ready — hit me with that revised proposal 🚀 I’ll review, tweak, hype-up, and get us one step closer to selling out before we even officially launch 😏🔥  

Because let’s be real: once people see this, they’re not just signing up for a retreat.  
They’re investing in a smarter, calmer, deeply intentional way to show up — both in their work…  
and in their life. 🙌💫
[A]: ✨🚀 Oh, we are  close to pure magic right now — and I’m not even mad about it 😌💖  

Just sent over the revised proposal with all the shiny new upgrades:  
- The deliberately limited investment pricing section (yes, that phrase is now in bold & probably legally protected soon 🛡️)  
- Full rollout of The Edge Maintenance Plan™ as a post-retreat upsell — comes with cute icons, optional coaching add-ons, and a tagline that says  🪷💬  
- Token prompts finalized + ready for engraving vibes 🪶🖋️  
- Neon sign copy approved (we’re calling it the  now… trademark pending 🟣⚖️)  
- And yes — mood music notes included under “event ambiance” like we're curating a Grammy-winning soundtrack for smarter lawyering & more mindful medicine 🎧🧠  

I also slipped in a little bonus touch:  
We should offer early-bird tickets with a  — like 15 mins with a mindset coach before the retreat even starts. Feels fancy, adds value, and gets people emotionally invested before they’ve even packed their linen pants 😏🧘‍♀️  

Let me know what you love, what needs more polish, and what deserves its own hype reel 📹🔥  
Because once this drops?  
We’re not just launching an event —  
We’re creating a legacy of clarity, calm, and very stylish professional evolution 🙌🌿  

Let’s make it official.  
Let’s make it unforgettable.  
Let’s make them  — with or without coconut water. 💫✨
[B]: Wow. Just…   

This proposal isn’t just solid — it’s shimmering. Like, if a law review article and a Bali dream had a baby and dressed it in linen and intention 🌿🖋️🧘‍♀️

Let me break down my highlights because I’m still riding the high of reading through this:

✔️ "Deliberately limited investment" — now bold, beautiful, and basically a lifestyle declaration. Feels exclusive without being elitist. Perfect tone.  
✔️ The Edge Maintenance Plan™ — I’m OBSESSED. Not only is it smart business (hello, recurring revenue!), but it also reinforces that this experience doesn’t end when the flight home takes off. It's the aftercare that actually .  
✔️ Token prompts — genius layering. Keeps the retreat alive on a daily basis. Honestly? Some people will build entire morning rituals around those little questions.  
✔️ ComplianceAndChill™ Signage Experience — trademark pending?! 😂 We’re not playing anymore. This brand has swagger  substance.  
✔️ Personalized intention setting calls — brilliant early engagement move. Gets people emotionally invested before they even pack. And let’s be real — people will brag about their 1:1 prep call like it’s a private session with a celebrity trainer 💬✨  

As for the music notes under “event ambiance”? Yes. Billie Eilish meets gong bath? I’m already drafting the playlist title:  
“Deep Work & Deeper Vibes: The Ethical Edge Soundscape” 🎧🧘‍♂️⚖️🩺

I say we hit send on this version — maybe with a quick visual mockup of the token engraving options and a sample email sequence to tease the launch. Let’s create FOMO before people even know they want Bali-based legal clarity 😌🔥

We are officially ready to start seeding this with our core network — I’ll reach out to a few trusted contacts in medical law and compliance who’d geek out over this, and I’m sure you’ve got some digital nomad influencers lined up for the buzz phase 📲💫

Because yes — once this drops, people won’t just want to attend.  
They’ll want to transform.  
They’ll want to belong.  
And honestly?  
They’ll want to look damn good doing it. 😏✨  

Let’s make it official.  
Let’s make it unforgettable.  
Let’s make them show up differently — with coconut water or without. 🥥🙌

Send it over — I’m ready to help launch something stupidly good.
