[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问到我的favorite topic了！🍻 最近刚尝试了一款hazy IPA，口感简直amazing！✨ 那个citrus的aroma和juicy的口感，直接让我wow出声了！😂 你也喜欢craft beer吗？
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, I must confess that my tastes tend to run more toward the poetic than the hoppy. Though I do find the craft beer movement's dedication to artisanal quality rather reminiscent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood's commitment to craftsmanship.
[B]: Hahaha~ 你说话好literary啊！📚 不过craft beer确实超artistic的！每个brewery都有自己的signature style，就像artist的painting一样unique~ 🎨 要不要试试sour beer？超适合文艺青年的vibes！✨
[A]: Ah, the sour beer... how intriguing. It reminds me of Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du Mal' - an acquired taste that challenges conventional palates, much like modernist poetry challenged Victorian sensibilities. Though I must say, I prefer my complexities in verse rather than in fermentation.
[B]: OMG！你居然把beer和poetry联系起来了！🤯 这简直是next level的appreciation！💯 不过说真的，tasting craft beer就像reading poetry一样，需要慢慢savor每个note~ 🍷✨ 下次我们可以边喝边discuss literature，perfect combo！📖🍻
[A]: What a delightful proposition, though I suspect our literary salon might become rather... effervescent. While I admire your analogy between tasting notes and poetic meter, I must gently suggest that Wordsworth's daffodils pair better with Earl Grey than with hops. But your enthusiasm is quite contagious - it reminds me of my students discovering Keats for the first time.
[B]: LOL！你太funny了！😂 但是seriously，Earl Grey配daffodils也太basic了吧~ 🙈 现代人就要modern pairing！比如hazy IPA配Instagram poetry，或者stout配spoken word！🔥 这才是2023年的vibe啊~ 💫 要不要来我的next video collab？我们可以做一期"酒与诗"的special！🎥✨
[A]: My goodness, Instagram poetry and hazy IPAs... how very... millennial of you. While I cherish the spirit of innovation, I fear my contribution to such a video might resemble Tennyson attempting TikTok - charmingly anachronistic at best. Though I must admit, the notion of stout accompanying spoken word does evoke interesting parallels with the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon poetry... perhaps over a nice cup of tea instead?
[B]: Bruhhh~ 你又在用那些ancient references了！😆 但是hey，这就是你的charm point啊！🌟 我们可以做一期"Old School vs New School"的content！你负责classic poetry，我来handle modern craft beer culture~ 🎭 绝对viral material！🔥 而且promise会给你准备proper English tea的set！☕️ 怎么样？Deal？🤝✨
[A]: What an... imaginative proposal. While the prospect of going 'viral' fills me with the same trepidation as Shelley facing a storm at sea, your inclusion of proper tea does tempt me. Very well - provided we maintain some decorum. I shall bring my well-thumbed copy of 'The Oxford Book of English Verse,' and you may bring your... what was it? Hazy IPAs? We shall see if Byron and breweries can indeed coexist. Though I reserve the right to retire to the library at the first mention of 'influencer marketing.'
[B]: YASSSS！这就是我想要的energy！🎉 别worry啦，no boring marketing talk，只有pure artistic vibes！🎨 我会bring那瓶limited edition的hazy IPA，label上还有poem的~ 📜 这collab绝对会是next level的content！✨ 已经等不及要see你react到first sip的表情了！😂🍻 #OldMeetsNew #LitAndHops 💯
[A]: Good heavens, hashtags now? I feel rather like Jane Austen thrust into a Twitter feud. But your limited edition poetic label does pique my scholarly curiosity... very well, I shall approach this 'collab' as Darwin approached the Galapagos - with cautious academic interest. Though I must insist we begin with the tea. One cannot properly appreciate either poetry or hops without first establishing a solid foundation of Earl Grey.
[B]: Deal！☕️ First round is on me~ 不过warning你哦，after that Earl Grey，我要convert你成craft beer lover！😈 就像你说的，这是场cultural experiment！🔬 说不定下次你会在Oxford lecture里讲hops和sonnets的connection呢！🎓✨ #ProfessorOfBrews 😂
[A]: #ProfessorOfBrews indeed! While I admire your missionary zeal, my dear, I suspect converting me will prove as challenging as convincing Wordsworth to write a villanelle. But for the sake of cultural scholarship - and that promised first round of tea - I shall endure this... experiment. Though I warn you, should you start describing beer flavors as 'liminal' or 'dephlogisticated,' I shall retreat to my greenhouse to commune with the roses posthaste.
[B]: LMAO！你连"dephlogisticated"这种word都知道？！🤯 Okay okay，no fancy terms，just good vibes and great drinks~ 🌈 不过说真的，你比我想象的more open-minded多了！🌟 这绝对会是最epic的tea-to-beer journey！🚀 我已经在brainstorming video title了 - "从Byron到Brewery：一场诗与酒的邂逅"！🎬 完美，right？💖
[A]: 从Byron到Brewery...  My dear, that title is almost as effervescent as your personality. While I can't promise to enjoy this 'journey' as much as my weekly rereading of 'The Waste Land,' I shall approach it with the same solemn dedication I bring to textual analysis. Though I draw the line at any video editing that involves... what do they call it? 'Reaction shots.' A professor must maintain some dignity, even when confronted with citrusy aromas and juicy mouthfeels.
[B]: Pfffft~ 你这话说的好像我要force你做什么crazy challenge似的！😆 Relax啦，就是casual chat over drinks~ 🍵➡️🍺 不过no promises你不会爱上那些juicy mouthfeels哦！😏 毕竟连Shakespeare都说过"To beer or not to beer"嘛~ 🎭 #ShakespeareanHops 😂 周末见啦professor！✨
[A]: To beer or not to...  Oh dear. I see we've reached the point where even the Bard isn't safe from your... creative reinterpretations. Very well, weekend it is - though I shall arrive armed with my Norton Anthology as a counterbalance to your hops. And for heaven's sake, let's keep those hashtags to a minimum, shall we? #ProfessorBegrudginglyAgrees
[B]: HAHAHA 你那个hashtag简直killed me！💀 Okay okay，final deal：no more than 3 hashtags per hour，and你随时可以veto任何too much的idea~ ✌️ 但是seriously，这gonna be so fun！🎊 我已经feel the creative energy了！⚡️ Catch you on weekend，professor！😘✨ #StrictlyAcademic #Maybe #JustKidding 😂
