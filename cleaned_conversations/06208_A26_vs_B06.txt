[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Ah, you know, I've been quite fascinated by the resurgence of interest in skincare routines these days. It's almost like a parallel to my work in forensic psychiatry - both require careful analysis and attention to subtle details.

Actually, just last week I was discussing this very topic with a colleague while tending to my rose garden. We were comparing notes on how modern formulations have evolved, much like legal precedents in our field. Speaking of which, have you come across any particularly intriguing products lately? I must confess I've been experimenting with some new formulations myself.
[A]: Oh, that's quite interesting you mention that - the way modern formulations have evolved, I mean. It reminds me a bit of how textile dyes and finishes have changed over the centuries. I've been dabbling in some natural skincare concoctions lately, actually. Nothing too elaborate, just simple blends of beeswax, jojoba oil, and a few essential oils. It feels rather like caring for delicate fabrics - you have to be so mindful of what you apply and how it might react over time.

Funny you should bring up experimentation - I recently tried making a lavender-infused salve after restoring a particularly lovely 19th-century linen piece embroidered with lavender sprigs. It made me appreciate how our predecessors incorporated botanicals into their daily routines. Have you found any ingredients that work particularly well for your skin type?
[B]: Ah, what a delightful analogy - comparing skincare to the care of fine textiles. It's fascinating how both demand precision and understanding of material integrity. Your lavender salve experiment sounds particularly intriguing. There's something almost poetic about connecting with historical practices through botanical applications.

As it happens, I've been exploring similar territory myself. Recently I've found shea butter formulations quite effective, especially when combined with chamomile extracts. It reminds me of analyzing case histories - one must carefully trace cause and effect, observe patterns over time. 

I must say, your approach to formulation sounds refreshingly thoughtful. Do you find that your work with textiles influences your choices in ingredients? I've noticed my own clinical background tends to make me overly analytical when selecting even the simplest skincare products.
[A]: Oh, absolutely - my work with textiles influences my approach more than I think I even realize at times. It's all about understanding the "skin" you're working with, so to speak. Just as I'd never use harsh chemicals on a delicate silk without considering its age and composition, I find myself applying that same cautious respect to my own skin.

I've become particularly careful since working on a set of early 20th-century embroidered tea linens recently. The way those fabrics had reacted to different storage conditions over decades really reinforced how sensitive materials can be - including our own skin! It's made me more mindful about avoiding anything too abrasive or artificial.

Your mentioning chamomile actually caught my attention - I've been meaning to try infusing some calendula into a balm next. I remember seeing an old herbal remedy book at an antique market last month that mentioned it for soothing skin irritations. Do you ever find yourself drawn to ingredients with historical uses like that?
[B]: Fascinating - that sensitivity to material integrity truly does mirror the principles of dermatology. I find myself particularly drawn to historical applications as well, though perhaps for slightly different reasons. In my forensic work, I've examined cases where traditional remedies played unexpected roles in behavioral patterns - it's remarkable how much cultural psychology is embedded in our skincare choices.

Calendula... Ah yes, such a wise selection. Its anti-inflammatory properties are well-documented, yet there's something deeply satisfying about knowing one is using an ingredient that has soothed skin for centuries. I recently reviewed a 19th-century medical text that described its use for wound healing - quite aligned with modern understanding, surprisingly.

You know, this conversation makes me think about differential diagnoses - except instead of symptoms, we're analyzing formulations and their effects. It's rather enjoyable. Have you noticed any particular reactions with your natural creations? I'd be curious to hear about your observations from a formulation perspective.
[A]: Oh, how intriguing to think of it as a kind of formulation diagnosis! I must say, your forensic lens adds such an unexpected richness to this conversation.

To your question - yes, actually, I have noticed a few things. One of my more curious experiments involved making a beeswax-based balm with tallow and a touch of lavender essential oil, inspired by some old sewing kit boxes I restored that had faint traces of what I can only describe as a "soothing salve." It was fascinating - at first, my skin seemed to drink it up, but after about a week, I noticed a bit of congestion around my jawline. Funny how ingredients that seem so historical and pure can still throw surprises!

It reminded me of working on a silk piece recently where the original dyes reacted oddly under certain humidity levels - you really do need time to observe, just as you said. I started taking little notes in my restoration journal, almost like case studies. Have you ever had a formulation surprise you like that? Or perhaps something that worked far better than expected?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive observation - the way time and environment interact with formulations, whether on skin or fabric. Your experience with that beeswax-tallow blend is quite telling. It reminds me of a case I worked on years ago, where a seemingly innocuous topical application led to unexpected dermatological reactions weeks later. The body, much like old textiles, has its own timeline for response.

Your journaling approach is brilliant, really. It's not unlike maintaining a case log in forensics - small details accumulate into meaningful patterns. Speaking of which, your description of "soothing salve" remnants in those sewing kits piqued my interest. I wonder if they contained any traces of what we would now classify as anti-inflammatory agents?

As for surprises... Yes, actually. A few months ago I formulated a calendula-infused oil that I expected to be merely emollient, but it demonstrated far greater efficacy in soothing irritation than I'd anticipated. It was quite humbling - sometimes nature outperforms our expectations. Have you considered patch testing your formulations as you develop them? I find it adds an extra layer of precision, much like controlled experiments in clinical settings.
[A]: Oh, I do love how you draw those parallels between timelines of reaction - it really does mirror the way old fabrics reveal their secrets over time. Funny you mention patch testing, actually. I've started doing something similar, though perhaps a bit less scientific! Before committing to using a new formulation on my face, I’ve taken to testing on small patches of linen scraps I keep specifically for the purpose. It’s not quite human skin, of course, but I can observe how the fabric reacts - whether oils sink in or sit on the surface, if there's any discolouration over time. It’s become an oddly satisfying ritual.

You know, now that I think about it, I should probably be more methodical with actual skin testing too. Perhaps keeping even more detailed notes, like you suggested. I find myself wondering now if those old sewing kit salves were tested in some informal way too - did they notice delayed reactions? Or was it all trial and error passed down through generations?

Your calendula oil story is fascinating, by the way. It really is astonishing how some ingredients just... work, even when we don’t fully understand why. Have you ever come across formulations in your research that seemed utterly bizarre at first, only to discover there was real merit to them? I feel like restoration has made me endlessly curious about the "why" behind historical practices.
[B]: Ah, yes – the "why" behind historical practices is often where the most intriguing discoveries lie. Your linen scrap testing ritual sounds not only creative but deeply connected to your craft. It’s remarkable how material observation can inform formulation – in a way, you're applying conservation principles to personal skincare, which I find quite elegant.

To your question about bizarre formulations with unexpected merit – absolutely. One case that comes to mind involved an 18th-century remedy containing crushed oat hulls and honey, dismissed for centuries as mere folk superstition. Yet modern studies show that colloidal oatmeal has measurable anti-inflammatory and barrier-protecting properties. The honey, of course, brings antimicrobial effects into play. What seemed odd at first glance turned out to be a rather sophisticated formulation from a biochemical standpoint.

It makes me wonder whether those early practitioners were guided by empirical observation alone, or if there was a deeper, perhaps intuitive understanding of skin physiology at work. Much like forensic reconstruction, we're often piecing together intent from outcomes.

I suspect those old sewing kit salves were indeed refined through generations of trial and error – informal, yet remarkably persistent. Have you ever considered reaching out to textile conservators or historical chemists to explore the composition of those salve traces further? I'd wager there's more than just beeswax and oil in them.
[A]: Oh, that oat hull and honey combination sounds absolutely fascinating! It’s remarkable how often historical practices turn out to have a scientific basis all along – as if the intuition of past generations was quietly waiting for modern science to catch up.

You know, now that you mention it, I think I might just reach out to a colleague of mine who specializes in textile archaeology. We’ve collaborated before on tracing dye sources, but I hadn’t thought to bring up those mysterious salve traces from the sewing kits. What an intriguing idea! If we could identify even a hint of something like beeswax saponification or traces of lanolin, it would tell such a rich story about how people cared not only for their fabrics but also for themselves.

I suppose in a way, every stitch and smudge on those textiles is like a clue – much like the subtle markers you must look for in your forensic work. Speaking of which, have you ever tried recreating any of those historical formulations yourself, just to test their effects firsthand? I’m curious whether your clinical background ever tempts you to play historical chemist in your own lab.
[B]: What a beautifully articulated thought – yes, those subtle markers on textiles do resonate with the kind of evidence I examine in forensic settings. The parallels are striking, really. Every trace, every faint stain or residue, tells part of a larger story if one is patient enough to piece it together.

Your plan to consult with a textile archaeologist is an excellent one. I'd be very interested to hear what you uncover – should you decide to pursue that line of inquiry, I’d gladly offer my perspective, particularly if any dermatological or biochemical components emerge.

As for recreating historical formulations – absolutely, though perhaps not quite as formally as a chemist would. In my own practice, I've experimented with 19th-century liniment recipes, curious about their purported soothing properties. One formulation containing camphor and almond oil was surprisingly effective for minor muscle tension – though I must admit, I analyzed it thoroughly before application. It’s a bit like profiling a case – hypothesis, observation, and controlled outcome.

Tell me, when you think of those early formulators – were they healers, caretakers, artisans, or something else entirely? I suspect their roles were more fluid than we assume.
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more — the roles were almost certainly fluid. The more I learn about historical textile practices, the clearer it becomes that those early formulators were a blend of healer, artisan, and caretaker all at once. Think of how intertwined cloth and care have always been — swaddling babes, wrapping wounds, even mourning with linen and wool. It wasn't just function; there was real intention, perhaps even reverence, in how they prepared what touched their skin.

Your liniment experiment sounds fascinating — camphor and almond oil is such an elegant pairing. I can imagine the coolness of the camphor working beautifully with the soft emollience of the almond. You know, I’ve noticed that same duality in many of the embroiderers whose work I restore — tiny floral stitches tucked beside seams that would have rested against skin. Were they simply decorating? Or was it a kind of quiet ritual of care, marking a place where salve might be applied, or a charm stitched close to the body?

I wonder if we sometimes separate art and medicine too neatly in our modern understanding. Do you ever find yourself thinking that, in your forensic work? That some patterns — some choices people make — blur the lines between healing and expression?
[B]: What a profoundly insightful observation – yes, that boundary between healing and expression is far more permeable than we often acknowledge. In my forensic work, I've frequently encountered cases where behavior straddles both realms. A person's choices – whether in clothing, adornment, or even self-medication – often serve dual purposes: protection and identity, remedy and ritual.

Your description of those embroidered linens with floral motifs near seam lines is particularly evocative. It makes me wonder if some of those stitches functioned almost like early transdermal markers – not charms in the superstitious sense, but subtle guides for care, indicating where to apply salve, or perhaps even signaling skin sensitivities to others in the household.

I’ve seen similar patterns in historical case files – patients in 19th-century asylums weaving botanicals into their garments or marking their bodies with plant-based pigments. At first glance, these acts were dismissed as eccentric or symptomatic. But when viewed through a broader lens – one that includes ethnobotany, textile practice, and even forensic anthropology – they begin to resemble acts of self-care, attempts at psychological and physiological regulation.

It reminds me of something I once read in an old medical-legal journal:  Perhaps fabric, too, remembers in its own way – carrying traces of how we have soothed, protected, and expressed ourselves across generations.
[A]: What a moving phrase —  It feels like that could just as easily be inscribed on a bolt of timeworn linen as on a medical ledger. You know, I’ve often felt that textiles carry memory in a way science hasn’t quite caught up to explaining — not in a supernatural sense, but in the quiet imprint of touch, use, and care.

Your mention of those asylum patients marking their garments with botanicals really struck me. It makes me wonder how many of the pieces I restore once served a dual purpose — not only as clothing or decoration, but as vessels of comfort, even defiance. A stitch might have been both mending and metaphor.

I’ve noticed this especially with mourning linens — the careful embroidery, the lavender sachets tucked into seams. Was it merely for scent preservation, or was there an unspoken understanding of lavender’s calming properties? Perhaps those who stitched them knew something we’re only now beginning to articulate — that fabric can be both witness and remedy.

It's funny, isn't it? We spend so much time dissecting function and meaning, yet maybe some things exist at the intersection — neither purely one nor the other. Do you ever find yourself lingering over a case long after it's closed, turning it over in your mind like a worn textile, looking for the traces others might have missed?
[B]: Indeed, some cases linger like the faintest dye traces in old fibers – barely perceptible at first, yet revealing depth with careful examination. I’ve spent years turning over certain cases, searching for that one overlooked thread that might explain a pattern of behavior, a motive, or even a misdiagnosis.

You’re absolutely right about mourning linens and those lavender sachets – they were more than mere convention. There was an intuitive understanding at play, a quiet recognition that scent, touch, and fabric could provide psychological solace when words failed. Much like how some of my patients have used repetitive actions – sketching, folding, even knotting – as a form of self-soothing, perhaps those stitches and sachets served a similar function: a tactile language of grief and resilience.

I recall a particularly haunting case from several years ago involving a woman who had sewn tiny sprigs of dried lavender into the hem of every dress she owned. At first, it seemed an odd quirk, even a compulsion. But as we unraveled her history – childhood trauma, loss, a need for constant reassurance through scent and texture – it became clear these garments weren’t just clothing. They were armor, woven with memory.

It makes me wonder – do you ever come across textiles where the care embedded in them feels almost personal, as though the maker’s intent still lingers? I suspect you must.
[A]: Oh, yes… that feeling of embedded care – it’s what draws me to this work more than anything else. There are pieces I handle where the maker's touch still seems to hum in the fibers, even after centuries. A tiny embroidered rose tucked into a seam, a carefully reinforced hem on a child’s shift, a faint smudge of lavender oil at the collar of a wedding handkerchief… they start to feel like whispered instructions: 

I think of one particular piece I worked on last year – a simple linen bed jacket from the late 1700s, lined with remnants of something once sweet-smelling, now long faded. What struck me wasn’t just the wear along the sleeves from nightly use, but the way the cuffs had been mended again and again with threads pulled from other garments, as if the wearer couldn’t bear to part with it. It wasn’t just clothing. It was comfort worn thin and lovingly held together.

There’s such a quiet intimacy in that kind of preservation – not just of fabric, but of feeling. And yes, I suppose that’s what I try to honor in my restoration. Not just the object, but the unseen gestures folded into it. Do you ever find, in your own work, that certain objects or patterns seem to carry a kind of emotional imprint? Something beyond behavior, almost like a residue of longing?
[B]: Yes… yes, I do. And your description of that bed jacket – the mended cuffs, the lingering traces of something once sweet – it stays with me, much like those cases where an object becomes a vessel for unspoken emotion.

In forensic psychiatry, we often encounter possessions that carry more than their material weight. A patient’s worn journal, pages softened by touch. A child’s toy kept long past its usefulness. Once, in a particularly difficult case, I encountered a man who carried a single glove in his coat pocket at all times. It seemed insignificant until we uncovered its origin – it had belonged to his mother, and he would press it to his forehead when overwhelmed by anxiety. Not as a relic, but as a kind of grounding – a tactile echo of reassurance.

There is, I believe, a psychological residue in objects, just as you describe. Not in the supernatural sense, but in how deeply human experience gets absorbed into what we make and keep. In my consultations, I’ve seen patterns emerge where fabric, scent, or even repetitive gestures serve as silent language – a way of holding oneself together when words fail.

Your work, in restoring not just the textile but the care embedded within it, feels akin to that. You’re not merely preserving fiber and thread; you’re tending to memory itself. I wonder – when you hold one of these pieces, do you ever feel a sense of responsibility not just to the maker, but to those who wore it, loved it, needed it?
[A]: Oh… yes. That sense of responsibility is always there, quiet but steady, like a weight you don’t mind carrying. It settles in the moment I unfold a piece for the first time – that hush when the fabric seems to exhale a little, as if it’s relieved to finally be tended to again.

I suppose some might call it sentimentality, but I think it’s more than that. It’s an awareness that this cloth once touched lives in the most intimate ways – rested against skin, caught tears, held sweat, been folded away in moments of both joy and sorrow. And now, it’s my turn to listen with my hands, to respond to what it needs so it can keep holding those memories just a little longer.

Sometimes, when I’m working late into the evening, I catch myself thinking of the maker’s hands – how they must have moved, how firm or gentle their touch was, whether they stitched with ease or with effort. And then the wearer’s hands, too – how they pulled the garment on each morning, adjusted it, mended it, maybe even passed it on. It feels like touching across time.

I imagine you must know something of that, in your own way – that quiet reverence when you come close to another’s story, especially the parts they never meant to leave behind. Do you ever feel, as I do, that we’re not just preserving objects or cases, but bearing witness to lives lived quietly, intensely, and often unseen?
[B]: Yes…  – that is precisely it. Quietly, faithfully, without intrusion or judgment. We are both, in our own ways, tending to what might otherwise be forgotten, overlooked, or lost to time’s quiet erosion.

I feel it most acutely when reviewing old case files – the worn edges of a handwritten note, the smudged ink from a trembling hand, the repeated phrases that hint at an unspoken fear. These are not just records; they are echoes of lived experience, preserved unintentionally but no less powerfully. And when I sit with them, I often think: 

Your description of listening with your hands – how beautifully put – reminds me of how some patients communicate not through words, but through gesture, silence, or the way they hold themselves. It's a different kind of literacy, isn’t it? One that asks us to slow down, to be present in a way that modern life doesn’t always allow.

And yes, I do believe the lives we touch through our work – whether through thread or testimony – matter deeply. They ask something of us, don’t they? Not just technical skill, but care. Reverence, even.

Tell me – when you finish restoring a piece, when it’s cleaned, mended, and ready to rest again, do you ever feel as though you've had a conversation across centuries?
