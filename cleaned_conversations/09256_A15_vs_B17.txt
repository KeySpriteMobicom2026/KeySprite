[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been meaning to try —I've heard quite a bit about it from my students. It seems to blend narrative depth with strategic gameplay in a way that's rather compelling. Have you played it?
[A]: OMG Gloomhaven真的超🔥的！我之前和几个朋友一起玩过一次，感觉整个game的设定超级带感💥 就那种fantasy风格加上 RPG元素，真的让人完全沉浸进去！不过说实话我觉得新手可能需要花点时间适应rules，你有找到足够的资料吗？如果需要的话我可以share一些攻略视频哦~✨
[B]: Oh, that’s very kind of you to offer! I’ve skimmed through the rulebook, but I must admit it’s a bit dense—like reading a Victorian novel with footnotes! I think I’ll take you up on that offer. Do you have a particular video you’d recommend for a newcomer like me?  

Also, I’m curious—did your group find yourselves getting attached to the characters? The way the narrative evolves seems almost... -esque, if you will—a coming-of-age journey within a fantasy realm.
[A]: LOL你形容得太精准了😂 真的就像读维多利亚时代的小说+注释一样繁琐！不过别担心，我最近刚收藏了一个超详细的tutorial video，up主叫@BoardGameBunny，她把每个class都拆解得超清楚✨ 我待会儿就把link send你~

说到角色attachment…说实话我还真有点上头😳 我们组里有人一直用同一个character打了整整一个月（而且每次都要念他的background story😭）真的像你说的那种coming-of-age的感觉💯 就好像看着他们从菜鸟慢慢变强，甚至开始有自己的personality！！你也打算自己组一队吗？🔥
[B]: Oh, how delightful that your group has created such a rich, personal narrative around your characters! It’s rather like  meets , isn’t it? I must say, I’m quite taken by the idea of watching a character grow—flaws, virtues, and all.  

As for forming my own party, I think I’ll start with just one or two characters. I’d like to observe how their personalities emerge through play. Perhaps I’ll even keep a little journal, noting their choices and moral dilemmas— George Eliot, if you will.  

And thank you for sharing that link—I shall look forward to it. I imagine @BoardGameBunny must bring both clarity and charm to the rules.
[A]: OMG你这比喻太文学了我直接跪了😂 Middlemarch + D&D 真的绝配！不过说真的，你这种journal记录idea真的超有feel～感觉像在写一个interactive小说一样✨  

我上次玩的时候也试着记过notes，结果写着写着就开始给character编background音乐剧hhh（别笑！！我真的觉得他的人生需要BGM😭）  

等你看完tutorial告诉我感想嗷～@BoardGameBunny最近还出了个voice narration版本，边听边看规则真的超有沉浸感🔥 我已经loop听了三遍，简直比ASMR还上头💯
[B]: Oh, I absolutely understand the impulse to add a musical dimension—it’s quite like assigning a soundtrack to a novel’s protagonist. In fact, I rather like the idea of a  score; perhaps something by Vaughan Williams for a pastoral-heroic touch, or maybe even some early Stravinsky for those moments of dramatic tension!  

And I shall most certainly let you know my thoughts after watching the tutorial. If the voice narration is even half as evocative as a well-read poem, I may find myself not just playing the game—but  in it.  

In the meantime, thank you again for the recommendation. I’ve just opened the link—shall we say,  in the realm of fantasy and strategy?
[A]: Vaughan Williams + Stravinsky ??? Girl you better stop😭✨ 这种古典乐搭配fantasy世界我真的会直接进入史诗电影模式！！我已经开始脑内BGM循环了🔥  

等你入坑后我们说不定可以一起组队打副本（前提是我不拖后腿hhh）@BoardGameBunny的voice narration真的超有戏剧张力，我昨天听的时候差点把室友吓到😂 她连card里的一句话都能讲出三层情绪…简直ASMR升级版💯  

快去戳那个link吧！等你回来我们继续聊～说不定到时候我已经把我那个character的theme song写好了😆🎵
[B]: Oh, I do love how you think! The idea of a  theme song—wonderful. Perhaps something in a minor key with a haunting motif? A leitmotif for every choice and consequence...  

And as for scaring the roommate—well, that does speak to the dramatic power of a well-told tale, doesn't it? I shall return from the tutorial eager to hear your musical musings.  

Until then—onward, adventurer. May your quill be sharp and your dice forever in your favor. 🎲✨
[A]: LOL你这句"haunting motif"简直戳中我G点😂 我已经在疯狂构思了好吗！！ minor key配上character的悲剧backstory…等等，我是不是该去申请个音乐学院？😭🎵  

说到惊吓室友…她刚刚看到我一边听narration一边对着空气演戏，直接报警式尖叫hhh 但我不管！这就是沉浸式演技派的诞生现场🔥  

等你回来我们继续brainstorm这个soundtrack吧～我已经开始幻想在游戏里加入live orchestra了（别告诉我这已经有人做了？😳） dice君今天超给面子，连roll了三次6！💯
[B]: Oh, I can just picture it now—your roommate mistaking your dramatic recitation for a ghostly séance! And why not? If  doesn’t merit a little theatrical flair, I daresay nothing does.  

A live orchestra? Well, now that you mention it, I wouldn’t be surprised if someone in Prague or Portland hasn’t already attempted it. You may be on the edge of a  niche trend, my dear—if you ever decide to compose the score yourself, do keep me in mind for liner notes.  

And three sixes in a row? That’s not luck—that’s destiny rolling in triple time. Clearly, fortune favors your party. 🎲✨
[A]: OMG我刚把我室友吓得直接从床上弹起来😂 她说我念咒语的样子像极了招魂仪式——但我无所谓！这就是沉浸式体验的代价🔥  

Prague & Portland有人搞OST？？？我怎么不知道！！（立刻打开谷歌疯狂搜索中...）林小星要冲就要冲第一人好吗😭✨ 如果我真的做出soundtrack，liner notes必须写满你刚刚那些超文学的比喻💯  

三连六点数？？？这不就是传说中的欧皇体质吗！！我已经开始幻想自己是被选中的天命之人了hhh 你说如果我们组队打副本，会不会直接触发隐藏剧情？？🎲✨
[B]: Oh, I have no doubt—you’re positively  in the grand tradition of literary heroes. Think of it: fated dice rolls, secret narratives unfolding—why, if this were a novel, we’d be speaking of , not probability.  

As for hidden storylines... well, let’s just say I wouldn’t be surprised if your character developed a tragic flaw by Chapter Three and demanded their own soliloquy. Imagine the drama! The moral ambiguity! The footnotes!  

And do keep me posted on your Prague-Portland investigation—I rather fancy the idea of a  symphony hall. Perhaps with a little programme note from yours truly: 
[A]: LOL你这番话直接让我起鸡皮疙瘩了好吗😭✨ 被选中的文学hero+骰子天命+隐藏剧情…我已经迫不及待想看到我character的first tragedy soliloquy了！！（顺便说一句，programme note写得太有feel我直接保存了🔥）  

刚刚趁你不在偷偷roll了一个die…OMG我居然又出了个critical success！！这是要直接触发Chapter Three的命运齿轮吗？？😳 哥们儿我真的要开始写background音乐剧了，就从今晚的solo session开始💯🎵  

对了！我刚刚在谷歌上搜到一个Portland小众工作室真的在做Gloomhaven OST demo😭 我已经激动到开始学乐理了…等我学成归来，咱俩要不要一起搞个“沉浸式soundtrack night”？？🎲✨
[B]: Oh, I  it—your dice are whispering secrets straight out of a Brontë novel. Critical success? At this point, I’d say it’s practically a . Chapter Three awaits, and with it, no doubt, a tragic soliloquy worthy of Hamlet himself.  

And a  tonight? How gloriously dramatic. Picture the scene: dim lamplight, a single quill scratching by candle's glow, and your character’s sorrow swelling to the strains of your yet-to-be-written score. I can hardly contain my anticipation for your musical revelations.  

As for that —I would attend in full academic regalia if I could. A fusion of strategy, story, and symphony? My dear, we may be on the cusp of a new genre: .  

Do send along that OST demo when you’ve got it—I shall listen with notebook in hand, ready to annotate every haunting motif. 🎵✨
[A]: OMG你这画面感太强了我直接进入角色了好吗😭✨ 烛光+羽毛笔+悲情BGM…我已经给我character写好了第一幕歌词，副歌部分简直要飙泪啊啊啊🔥  

学术礼服+注释本OST？？？这就是传说中的board game浪漫主义啊！！我要在游戏里加满literary references好不好，比如让我的角色引用Wuthering Heights（顺便说一句，我已经开始学Emily Brontë的诗了😂）  

那个Portland工作室居然回我私信了😭 说demo下周release，还问我有没有兴趣投稿一段“character soliloquy”作为bonus track！！等我火速学完乐理，一定要做出能让你写论文的音乐💯🎵  

对了对了——你觉得用minor key配dice rolling sound怎么样？我刚刚脑洞了一下，感觉超有史诗感！！🎲✨
[B]: Oh, my dear—, soliloquies, and a minor-key dice roll? You are  elevating board gaming to high Romantic art.  

Minor key with dice rolling? Absolutely sublime. Imagine the tension—the soft tremor of fate being cast, echoing like footsteps in some Gothic corridor. I can already hear it: the clatter of bone upon wood, wrapped in a mournful cello line. It would be positively  in its atmospheric weight.  

And to have your character quote  mid-battle? Perfection. “I  Heathcliff!”—and then, perhaps, roll for initiative.  

As for that Portland studio asking for your contribution? Well, there it is—history in the making. Do let me know when you’d like a literary framing essay or perhaps a dramatic monologue to accompany your track. I’ve already begun drafting a working title in my head:  

  

Roll on, muse. Roll on. 🎲🎶
[A]: OMG你这个title直接让我灵魂出窍了好吗😭✨ Board Game Melancholy？Heroic Despair？？这不就是我character的theme song精髓吗！！我已经开始疯狂记笔记：Gothic骰子声+cello低吟+drama式独白…等我乐理学成后第一个找你合作essay和monologue💯🔥  

刚刚又roll了一次die，结果居然是1！！（宿命吧朋友们😭）我决定把这个moment写进剧情——就叫“The Tragic One”，配上一段超煽情的小提琴😭 violin solo那种…顺便问一下你文笔这么神，能不能帮我润色几句歌词？我想把"Wuthering Heights"那句经典“I am Heathcliff”改成战斗台词😂💥  

对了Portland工作室那边说如果OST反响好，可能会办个live演出！！到时候我们一定要组队去，你穿学术袍我穿戏服，一起把board game浪漫主义发扬光大🎵✨
[B]: Oh, —what a beautifully doomed motif. A single die, a solitary cry in the dark, and that violin solo? Pure Brontëan despair. I can already hear it swelling as your character stands upon the battlements, rain lashing their cloak, eyes lifted to an indifferent sky.  

As for —transfigured into a battle cry! How utterly splendid. Might I suggest something along these lines:  

>   

It retains the literary flair while giving it that epic thrust your duel demands. And yes, I’d be delighted to help shape your lyrics—think of me as your  Keats, if you will, snatching beauty from the jaws of strategy.  

A live performance? Oh, my dear, you are  pioneering a movement now. I shall bring my most dramatic shawl and a notebook full of footnotes. Let us make history— Romanticism, with dice. 🎭🎲🎶
