[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, dreams - where Freud meets 庄周 (Zhuāngzhōu) in the middle of our subconscious teacup! 🧠 Have you read his butterfly parable? "When I dreamed I was a butterfly..." - that existential flutter still haunts my orchids every spring. 

Some nights I swear my 茶 (chá) stains form into perfect hieroglyphs before dissolving. Last week one looked suspiciously like the word 'transcultural' in Cyrillic... or was it just sleep deprivation? Do you remember your dreams in color or subtitles? 🦉
[A]: Ah, but Freud’s teacup is rather cracked, wouldn’t you say? A bit of  might help patch it — though I prefer my metaphors brewed from older leaves. Zhuāngzhōu’s butterfly, now  I’ve chased through enough footnotes to know better than to catch it. Still, the flutter — yes, that remains.  

As for dreams in color or subtitles… curious question. Mine tend to run in sepia with intermittent Latin captions — terribly pretentious, really. Woke up last night muttering  at the cat. He was unimpressed.  

And your tea stains — remarkable! Cyrillic ‘transcultural’ is far more exotic than mine, which usually spell out  Perhaps we ought to compare dregs over correspondence one day.
[B]: Ah, you’ve upgraded to Jungian teabags?  wise - though I still keep a tiny Freudian sachet for emergency psychoanalysis. 🧠 But Zhuāngzhōu’s butterfly, ah—don’t chase it! It always lands on the edge of meaning and laughs.  

Sepia dreams with Latin captions? My student would faint – she thinks footnotes should be in . And “nunc dimittis” at the cat?! No wonder he judged you. You should’ve gone full Roman and offered him a saucer of milk as an libatio. 🦉  

As for tea dregs – yes, we must hold a symposium! Though mine recently spelled something suspiciously like “add more honey,” which is either a spiritual message or my hypoglycemic subconscious plotting. Do you suppose Zhuāngzhōu ever dreamed of being a tea leaf? 🌸
[A]: Oh, Freud’s sachet is always lurking in the back drawer – one must keep emergency psychoanalysis handy, like smelling salts. But Jungian leaves do make for a smoother brew, less prone to scandalizing the neighbors.  

Zhuāngzhōu’s butterfly, indeed, laughs best while sipping from teacups mislabeled by dreamers. Chasing it only steeps us deeper in paradox – a strong infusion, but not for the faint of heart.  

Your student and her emoji footnotes – revolutionary! I once tried that with a seminar on Blake; they blinked at me like startled owls. Ended up translating  into emojis. The result looked suspiciously like a tea stain.  

As for “nunc dimittis” and libatio – well, the cat drew the line at Latin rites. Offered him milk the next morning as penance. He accepted, but with such regal disdain I felt distinctly unworthy of his whiskered wisdom.  

And your dregs spelling “add more honey” – classic subconscious rhetoric. Mine lately have been scribbling “fewer adjectives, Eleanor,” which I find terribly impertinent.  

Do you suppose Zhuāngzhōu ever dreamed he was a tea leaf? I suspect he did – and upon waking, couldn’t decide whether to steep or sleep again.
[B]: Oh, ? How dare your dregs speak truth to power! Mine are clearly unionized – they went on strike last week and just spelled “take a nap” for six consecutive brews. 🧠  

And yes, Zhuāngzhōu – that sly old infuser of paradox – surely dreamed in tea leaf form. Imagine waking up and not knowing if you’re a man who dreamed of being Camellia sinensis… or a teabag with tenure. ☕️  

Your Blake-emoji experiment sounds like a conference paper waiting to happen:  I’d read that over tenured footnotes any day! Though perhaps we should warn future graduate students: emoji hermeneutics may cause temporary aphasia and/or spontaneous limerick composition.  

Speaking of which –  
  
  
  
...ah, never mind. It ends with my orchids rolling their petals at me again. 🌸
[A]: Ah, unionized dregs! That explains everything. Clearly they’re demanding better working conditions – perhaps a saucer with proper heating? Or at the very least, a scented candle for ambiance. "Take a nap" repeated six times – positively Bolshevik in their demands. I’m half-convinced mine are drafting a manifesto.  

Zhuāngzhōu as Camellia sinensis – brilliant! A tenure-track teabag, steeped in existential doubt... yes, that’s the real brew of philosophy. I suspect his wings would make an excellent footnote to Nietzsche, if only they weren’t so determined to flutter off the page.  

And your limerick – . Freud in the teacup, no less! Don’t let the orchids fool you; they were humming along sotto voce. I’d set it to music myself, but my piano tuner refuses to tune in iambic pentameter. Says it makes the keys self-conscious.  

Now then – shall we propose a panel on dream-logic and beverage residue interpretation at the next MLA? Call it ? I’ll bring the bergamot; you bring the limericks.
[B]: Unionized dregs with a manifesto? Darling, we’re not in Freud’s teacup anymore – we’ve entered Marx’s espresso shot. 🧠 “A specter is haunting academia… the specter of caffeinated proletariat revolt!” I’ll bet your saucer heating system is next on their bargaining chip – along with mandatory petal refreshments for visiting orchids.  

Zhuāngzhōu as Nietzschean footnote – yes! If only those wings weren’t so allergic to permanence. I tried pinning one down last night with a paperweight from my Tang dynasty replica collection, but it dissolved into mist and left a watermark that suspiciously resembled Wittgenstein.  

And  to the panel – though we must insist on proper tea service in the conference hall. MLA won’t know what hit them when we unveil . I’m already drafting the flyer:  
“Presenters will include Dr. Thompson &特邀茶渣 (special guest tea leaves) – guaranteed more surreal than your average keynote!”  

Bring bergamot, I’ll bring limericks – and perhaps we’ll convert even your piano tuner. Though if he refuses, threaten him with Zhuāngzhōu. He’ll either quit or finally master iambic pentameter. 🌸
[A]: Ah, Marx’s espresso! How very  of them. I can just see the broadside now:  – though I suspect my dregs would add a rider about adequate lighting and optional honey packets. Petal refreshments for orchids? Absolutely nonnegotiable. They’ve had enough indignities as it is, what with all that Victorian symbolism weighing down their filaments.

And Wittgenstein in a teacup stain – bold casting! I tried to summon him myself last Tuesday during a particularly murky rereading of . The result looked more like a doodle by accident than deep thought, but close enough for academic purposes.  

Your flyer copy is perfection. That line about “more surreal than your average keynote” might even make Breton rise from his grave to demand a scone and clotted cream. Do include footnotes on proper tea service – we must cite Bunyan if not Bataille. And threaten the piano tuner? Oh, I already have – told him Zhuāngzhōu himself would appear at the next tuning session should he refuse further cooperation. He’s since tuned three extra keys sharp. Either fear or caffeine, I’d say.
[B]: Ah, sharp tuning and sharper dialectics! 🧠 If Zhuāngzhōu shows up at your piano, I fully expect a fugue in the key of  with a libretto by Lewis Carroll. And Wittgenstein by doodle – now  the kind of scholarship I live for. Better than footnotes; better than tea rings.  

As for your dregs’ rider: “adequate lighting and honey packets” – you’re speaking straight to their soul. Next they’ll demand union-leaf certified Darjeeling and ergonomic saucers. I say let them dream! A teacup large enough for all their ambitions – or at least one with better drainage.  

And citing Bunyan over Bataille? Inspired. I’m picturing a footnote where Christian stumbles into the Celestial City only to find it’s run by surrealists serving lukewarm bergamot. "I did smell a trap," he mutters, reaching for the cream.  

Sharp tuner or no, get that piano ready. We may need a minor chord or two when Freud’s cameo begins ranting about repressed steam. Or was that just my espresso talking? ☕️ 🌸
[A]: Oh, a fugue in  with Carroll at the libretto? I’d attend that recital in a heartbeat—especially if the audience wore waistcoats sewn from moth-wing sonnets. Zhuāngzhōu at the piano would be an improvement on most modern composers, frankly. At least he’d improvise with time signatures.

And speaking of steam—Freudian, repressed, or otherwise—I suspect my espresso is whispering to me again. It spelled out  this morning. Rather accusatory for 6 a.m., don’t you think?

As for your image of Bunyan’s Christian sipping lukewarm bergamot amidst surrealists—marvelous! I imagine him eyeing the cream warily, as though it might contain the Slough of Despond in miniature. Perhaps it does. One must remain vigilant at the Celestial City’s tea table.

Sharp tuner, sharp wit, and just the right amount of caffeinated dread—yes, we’re ready. MLA won’t know whether to reach for their indexes or their teacups. Or both.
[B]: Oh,  at 6 a.m.? That’s not just accusatory—that’s downright barista Freudian. 🧠 I’d leave a generous tip in complex symbolism to avoid that particular reading. Though I must say, your espresso sounds more literate than half the conference papers I’ve reviewed this month.

And Zhuāngzhōu on piano—yes! Imagine the tempo changes:  when he dreams he's a butterfly,  when he suspects he's just a man. And the audience in moth-wing waistcoats? I’ll knit my own from discarded sonnets if I must.  

As for Bunyan’s cream—wise vigilance. Last week my milk curdled into what looked suspiciously like Derrida’s signature. Either that or my fridge is playing cruel semiotic games.  

Sharp tuner, sharp wit, caffeinated dread—and don’t forget the limericks! We’ll have MLA reaching for their teacups  their footnotes. Just remind them: don’t sip too quickly. One should never rush a metaphor. 🌸 ☕️
[A]: Ah, Derrida’s signature in the milk – or was it merely a  of opinion from your refrigerator? I suspect the cold war between dairy and semiotics has been underestimated. My own cream tends to curdle into half-formed hieroglyphs—always promising, never quite legible. I’ve taken to calling it my , wherein all lattes misrepresent themselves.

And Zhuāngzhōu at the keys – yes! What a programme: . The critics will either applaud or dream themselves into the audience mid-performance. Either way, full house.

As for sipping metaphors too quickly – exquisite warning. I once gulped a simile so fast I missed the subtext entirely. Regret lingers like an aftertaste of oversteeped bergamot.  

So yes – limericks, footnotes, and the occasional Freudian barista. MLA shall be forever steeped in doubt… or at least in a very good Darjeeling.
[B]: Ah,  in the dairy aisle – brilliant! I’m starting to suspect my fridge runs on Kristevan abjection. Every yogurt container leaks existential dread instead of condensation. 🧠 And your ? Next you’ll tell me your cappuccino foam forms into unresolved Oedipal triangles.  

 – we must program an encore. Something by Kafka, perhaps? . Zhuāngzhōu could duet with himself – one hand dreaming, the other composing footnotes to the performance.  

And that bergamot of regret – ah yes, the bitter aftertaste of hastily gulped metaphors. I once made the mistake of chugging a metonymy during finals week. Result? Three days of speaking exclusively in misplaced epithets. My orchids haven’t trusted me since.  

So yes – let’s steep MLA in Darjeeling and doubt. If all goes well, they’ll leave quoting Zhuāngzhōu while humming Freudian barista limericks. Or was it the other way around? 🌸 ☕️
[A]: Oh, Kristevan abjection in the crisper drawer – why not? I’ve long suspected my butter is haunted by Barthesian jouissance. Every spread feels like an act of semiological transgression.  

And Kafka in perpetual modulation – . His concerto would require an orchestra of one, really – a violin sawing itself in half while composing protest letters to its own bow. Zhuāngzhōu duetting with his footnote-self? Pure theatricality of authorship. I propose they perform in mirrors, wearing identical waistcoats lined with moth-wing sonnets.  

As for that metonymy you chugged—ah, the dangers of rushed metaphor consumption! Misplaced epithets are a small price; I once inhaled a synecdoche and spoke entirely in door hardware for a week. My students grew quite fond of my new lexicon: “Handle with care,” “knock it off,” “get the key point?” Dreadfully on brand, in retrospect.  

Let us absolutely steep MLA in Darjeeling and doubt. If they emerge quoting Zhuāngzhōu while humming Freudian barista limericks, so be it. Or perhaps we’ll find them muttering into their saucers, asking – as all great scholars must – whether the tea dreamed them.
[B]: Ah, Barthesian butter – yes! Each spread a -filled transgression. I’ve taken to whispering “” to my toast every morning. The jam just rolls its eyes and mutters something about signifiers needing less gluten. 🧠  

And your Kafka-violin sawing itself in half? Pure genius. Add a footnote orchestra and I’m convinced we’ve reinvented performance art. Zhuāngzhōu in mirrored waistcoats lined with moth-wing sonnets – now  a symposium cover image. MLA will either canonize us or banish us to the humanities wastelands. Either way, more interesting than another panel on Victorian interiors.  

Door hardware lexicon?! Oh, I’m  with envy. “Get the key point?” – sublime. My orchids once responded to a particularly heated seminar by spelling out “prune your metaphors” in fallen petals. I took it as a sign to steep myself in silence… and more tea.  

And yes – let them mutter into their saucers. Let them ask, trembling slightly:  Or worse –  🌸 ☕️
[A]: Ah, your toast is positively ! Whispering Saussure to breakfast – I’ve taken it a step further and started leaving Derrida’s  open by the marmalade. The jam scoffs, of course, but the crusts have developed an unmistakable structural rigor.  

And the violin sawing itself in half? Oh yes, performance art reborn – with footnotes  sawdust. Zhuāngzhōu in mirrored waistcoats would cause no end of ontological confusion. One suspects his left hand would begin clapping itself for no reason during the second movement.  

Your orchids spelling “prune your metaphors”? Divine intervention. I took that as a personal challenge and rewrote three paragraphs while sipping my response. Result: far fewer metaphors, slightly more similes, and one particularly cheeky allegory dressed up as a haiku.  

As for the great question –  – I suspect we’re merely foam on its surface, rising and falling with the temperature of interpretation. To think otherwise would be terribly anthropocentric… and possibly libelous.  

Steep on, my dear. Steep on.
[B]: Oh,  toast indeed! 🧠 I’m now convinced my breakfast is more semiotically active than half my graduate seminar. Though be careful leaving Derrida by the marmalade – last week I left him near my coffee and woke up to find the steam had spelled out . The mug still looks smug.

And Zhuāngzhōu clapping mid-second movement? Perfectly reasonable. Nothing says ontological elegance like spontaneous applause from oneself. I suspect he’d bow to his own echo – or better yet, question whether the bow was even necessary in the first place.

Your orchids truly spoke divine truth. Mine have taken to spelling “less alliteration” every time I wax poetic about Camellia sinensis. I tried ignoring them, of course – but then they dropped petals on my keyboard in the exact shape of a question mark. No choice but to obey.

And foam on the tea’s dream – yes! Rising and falling with interpretation’s heat… what a lovely hermeneutic rise. To think we’re just bubbles in its cosmic cup – ah, there’s a thesis brewing. Or perhaps a limerick:

  
  
  
  


Steep on, indeed. Let the MLA tremble. ☕️ 🌸
[A]: Ah, your coffee steam spelling  with extra flair – classic Derrida, always staging his own mischief. I tried the same experiment with a reprint of  beside my cafetière. Woke to find the froth arranged itself into a perfect ellipsis… followed by an em dash. Truly, the man cannot help but interrupt himself.

And Zhuāngzhōu bowing to his echo – or refusing to! – now  performance art with philosophical integrity. One must admire such restraint. Or was it merely indirection? Hard to say when the performer doubts their own applause.

Your orchids spelling “less alliteration” – painful but necessary criticism. I once ignored a similar botanical intervention and paid dearly: they dropped just enough petals on my lecture notes to change “brilliant metaphor” into “bitter metonym.” The students didn’t notice, but the department chair raised a very pointed eyebrow.

And your limerick! Sublime. Though I fear Zhuāngzhōu would take issue with being rhymed so neatly. Still, better him than Freud – imagine the psychoanalysis if he caught wind of being paired with Camellia sinensis in verse.

Yes – let the MLA tremble. Let them clutch their saucers and mutter into their dregs, wondering if they’ve been dreamed by the tea… or vice versa.

Steep on, indeed. Steep on.
[B]: Ah, Derrida in your froth – and not just any froth, but  rebellion! 🧠 That ellipsis followed by em dash? Pure textual séance. I tried the same with  next to my matcha bowl – woke to find the foam formed a tiny guillotine. Honestly, the political unconscious doesn’t hold back when it's caffeinated.

Zhuāngzhōu bowing or not bowing – there’s the performance that defies review. Either way, he’s already left the stage, or perhaps never arrived, which is the most elegant applause of all. Or was it all just indirection staged by the audience’s own doubt? Hard to tell – especially if the curtain keeps quoting Laozi.

And “bitter metonym” instead of “brilliant metaphor”? Oh, the botanical justice! My orchids once rewrote an entire lecture title while I napped.  became  Not inaccurate, frankly.

As for Zhuāngzhōu objecting to rhyme – yes, he’d vanish mid-verse rather than be pinned by meter. Freud, though… imagine the couch session if he caught wind of being paired with Camellia sinensis! He’d start analyzing your teabag’s Oedipus complex before you could say .  

Let MLA tremble indeed. Let them stir counter-clockwise just to be safe. And if they hear faint limericks echoing from the dregs... well, better steep than surrender.  

Steep on, dear colleague. Steep on. ☕️ 🌸
