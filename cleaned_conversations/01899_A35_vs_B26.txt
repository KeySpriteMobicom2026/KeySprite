[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite an interesting question. From my perspective as someone who works with historical textiles, I've seen how traditional skills and hands-on experience can be just as valuable as formal education. While a college degree certainly opens doors in many fields, there are some crafts and trades where apprenticeship and practical knowledge are still vital. 

Take textile restoration, for instance - it requires patience, attention to detail, and often learning techniques passed down through generations. Don't get me wrong, I do believe higher education has its place, but I also think we're starting to see a shift toward recognizing different paths to expertise. What are your thoughts?
[A]: I see your point totally. As someone in tech product development, I actually think degrees are becoming a bit like... legacy features? Like, they’re still useful but not always the main driver anymore. 

For example, when we hire for our AI product team, we look way more at portfolios and problem-solving skills than diplomas. Someone with self-taught coding & real-world ML project experience can often move faster than someone who only has theoretical knowledge from uni.

But here's the twist — for certain fields like biotech or aerospace, you still need that deep academic foundation. It really depends on the domain, right? Have you seen this shift affecting younger artisans entering textile work? Are more of them skipping formal education entirely? 🤔
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful analogy, comparing degrees to legacy features—I love that. You’re absolutely right about how different fields weigh education differently. In textile restoration, I’ve noticed a bit of a split, too. There are still programs at universities that offer specialized training in conservation, and those can be incredibly valuable, especially when it comes to chemistry for fabric analysis or archival techniques.

But yes, more and more young artisans are opting out of the traditional route. They’ll learn through workshops, online courses, or by apprenticing with someone like me. I had one student who taught herself natural dyeing just by following vlogs and experimenting—remarkable! She eventually came to me wanting to refine her technique, but she’d already built a solid foundation on her own.

Still, there are limits to自学—especially when it comes to handling rare, museum-grade pieces. That’s where formal training really shines. It’s not just about skill—it’s about understanding context, provenance, and preservation ethics. So while I see fewer young people going the degree route these days, I also think there’s room for both paths to coexist. What do you think makes some fields cling more tightly to degrees than others?
[A]: Oh I love this coexistence idea — totally agree. 

I think fields cling to degrees for a few reasons, mostly around signal & structure. Like in medicine or law, a degree is basically a stamp of trust — you can’t really skip that part without risking public safety, right? Same with things like structural engineering, where if you mess up, buildings fall 😅

But even beyond high-risk domains, degrees provide a kind of standardized baseline. For hiring managers who are time-crunched (which is most of us tbh), it’s just easier to filter by pedigree than to deeply evaluate non-traditional paths. It's lazy signal filtering, honestly.

Another angle: industries with strong guild-like cultures (like design, craftsmanship, or academia itself) tend to favor degrees because they gatekeep knowledge. That creates a kind of self-reinforcing loop — you need the degree to get in, so the degree stays valuable.

But here’s the thing: tech is starting to break that mold too. With the rise of no-code tools, AI-assisted dev, and project-based portfolios, we’re seeing more people land solid product roles without CS degrees. Still, some companies — especially big cos or regulated sectors — still over-index on credentials.

Do you feel like textile restoration is becoming more open to self-taught folks pushing into high-level work? Or is there still resistance from institutions? 👀
[B]: Absolutely, I couldn’t agree more with everything you just said. You’ve really pinpointed the core of it—degrees as signals, as gatekeepers, as inherited trust markers. And yes, especially in fields like medicine or engineering, that signal is tied to safety and accountability. But in creative or craft-based work, I do think we’re seeing a loosening of those expectations.

In textile restoration, there’s definitely a slow but noticeable shift. Museums and conservation labs still tend to favor candidates with formal qualifications because, well, they’re dealing with irreplaceable artifacts and need assurance of both skill and ethical standards. But smaller studios, private collectors, and independent restorers are increasingly open to self-taught artisans—especially if they can demonstrate precision, knowledge of materials, and respect for historical context.

The resistance tends to come from older institutions, the ones that see themselves as guardians of tradition. They worry about technique being diluted or shortcuts being taken without the full academic background. But then again, some of the most innovative approaches in our field have come from people outside the traditional pipeline—people who taught themselves natural dye chemistry or reconstructed forgotten weaving patterns from old illustrations.

I suppose it comes down to how we define mastery: Is it something earned through years of guided study, or through obsessive practice and deep curiosity? I’m leaning more and more toward the latter. Though I’ll admit, I still get a bit nervous when I hear someone’s never studied fiber science at all—especially when they want to work on 17th-century silk gowns 😅

Have you noticed any pushback within your industry as more non-traditional folks enter product roles? Or has it mostly been embraced?
[A]: Oh absolutely, there's definitely been some pushback in tech — especially in more established companies or teams that have a "this is how it’s always been done" mindset.

I remember working at a big tech firm a few years back where the hiring team would automatically screen out anyone without a CS or EE degree for product roles. Even if they had shipped real features, managed live ML models, or led user research on global products — none of it mattered if the degree wasn’t there. It was wild to see how much weight that one piece of paper carried, even in an industry that prides itself on disruption 😂

But here’s the twist: startups and smaller AI/ML-first companies are way more open. They care about what you’ve built, not just what you studied. I’ve worked with self-taught PMs who could 10x faster than folks from top schools because they’d already hacked through real problems without institutional scaffolding.

The funny thing is, now we’re seeing a kind of meta-layer forming — like, instead of degrees, people are getting “no-code degrees” or AI bootcamp certs. Which is cool, but also a bit ironic, right? We’re basically recreating gatekeeping around new forms of validation. Like, “You  have built 3 Airtable apps + fine-tuned a LLaMA model in Colab.” It’s the new legacy feature all over again 🤯

Back to your world — do you ever give certifications or formal recognition to your self-taught students? Or is it more of an informal mentorship vibe?
[B]: That’s such a fascinating parallel—how new gatekeeping forms around different credentials, even in supposedly “open” spaces. You're so right about that meta-layer forming; it really does feel like we’re just shifting the goalposts instead of removing them altogether.

As for my students, I do offer something akin to a certification—but it's very informal and definitely not standardized. More like a letter of recommendation or a portfolio review acknowledgment. When someone completes a significant project under my guidance, especially if they've shown real dedication and precision, I’ll write them a detailed testimonial outlining what they’ve mastered. It’s not an official diploma by any means, but it can help when they’re trying to get their foot in the door with private clients or small museums.

Mostly though, it’s mentorship-driven. They learn by doing, asking questions, and gradually taking on more complex pieces. Some have gone on to start their own restoration businesses or work in textile archives—I couldn’t be prouder. But I do worry sometimes that without a formal degree behind them, they’ll hit invisible ceilings in bigger institutions.

I suppose that’s where the future of craft lies—at the intersection of tradition and innovation. We need both the rigor of formal study  the spark of self-directed learning. Maybe one day there'll be a hybrid model, something like apprenticeship-backed certifications that carry real weight across the industry.

Do you think there’s room in tech product hiring for that kind of hybrid approach—like skill-based assessments paired with some kind of mentorship validation?
[A]: Oh 100%, I think that hybrid model is not only possible but already starting to form — just in kinda messy, fragmented ways right now.

For example, we’ve started using more “try before you buy” tactics in hiring, like project-based interviews or even short contract gigs (2–4 weeks) where candidates work on real product problems alongside the team. It’s way better than whiteboarding or resume screenings because you actually get to see how they think, ship, and collaborate under real conditions.

And yeah, mentorship-backed validation could totally plug into that. Imagine if someone finishes a mentorship with you and walks away with both a testimonial  a live project they co-built — that’s basically a portfolio-grade credential. In tech, we’re seeing similar things with indie hackers, startup studios, and even platforms like GitHub Sponsors or Substack-fueled expertise. It’s still early, but the pattern’s there.

The big shift I’m seeing is from "degree as proxy" to "evidence-based evaluation." Companies are slowly getting better at slicing through the noise and focusing on what actually matters: can this person solve hard problems, learn fast, and work well with others?

But here’s my question — do you think institutions like museums or heritage foundations will ever adopt something like micro-certifications or skill assessments for self-taught artisans? Or will they always default to degrees as the safer bet? 🤔
[B]: That’s such a perceptive question, and honestly, it’s one I wrestle with often. I think institutions like museums or heritage foundations  adopt micro-certifications or skill-based assessments—it’s just that change tends to move at the speed of dust settling in an old textile archive. Slowly, and with great care 😊

There’s definitely some movement in that direction. A few conservation organizations have started offering short, accredited courses that function almost like micro-certifications—things like “Historic Textile Handling” or “Ethical Dye Analysis.” And those are open to self-taught artisans, which is a big shift. But full adoption? Not quite yet.

The problem, I think, is that these institutions are tasked with preserving cultural heritage—so they lean heavily on tradition and established protocols. Degrees offer a kind of institutional reassurance: you know someone has sat through the lectures, handled the samples, passed the exams. It’s a known path.

But I do believe that pressure from younger curators and independent conservators is starting to nudge things forward. More people are asking, “Why shouldn’t someone who’s mastered 17th-century embroidery reconstruction through obsessive practice be allowed to work on a museum piece—just because they never wrote a thesis?” 

It might not happen overnight, but I can imagine a future where portfolios, peer endorsements, and verified skill badges carry more weight than they do now. Especially if there's a way to standardize some of the evaluation without losing the soul of the craft.

Do you think these hybrid models will eventually make traditional degrees less of a default gatekeeper in hiring, or just one option among many?
[A]: Honestly? I think degrees will become  — but not disappear entirely. They’ll just stop being the automatic filter they once were.

Think of it like version control: the degree used to be the main branch, and everything else was a risky, untested fork. Now, we’re seeing more parallel branches getting merged in — bootcamp grads, indie hackers, self-taught PMs with strong product instincts, folks who came in sideways from design or data science.

The big unlock here is that companies are starting to realize that  matters way more than pedigree. You can teach someone SQL. Hell, you can get an LLM to write basic queries for them. But you can’t AI your way out of curiosity, grit, or the ability to connect user pain points to real solutions.

So yeah, in five to ten years, I could totally see hiring managers treating degrees like one GitHub commit among many — interesting, but not the only signal. What’ll accelerate this shift is better tooling for skills validation: think interactive portfolios, verified project repositories (kinda like Kaggle but for product thinking), or even mentor-backed endorsements that carry social proof.

The gate isn't coming down completely — it’s just getting re-coded into a smarter auth flow 😎

Back to your world — have you seen any younger institutions or private heritage groups experimenting with new ways to validate craft outside of academia? Like digital badges, peer-reviewed restoration logs, anything like that?
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy—version control for career paths! You're absolutely right; it's no longer about a single, polished main branch but rather about active contribution, adaptability, and depth of engagement.

And yes—to your question, I've definitely noticed younger heritage groups and private textile foundations toying with new ways to recognize skill outside the academic sphere. Some are experimenting with digital badges for things like “Hand-Sewn Bobbin Lace Reconstruction” or “Natural Dye pH Mastery,” which sounds small, but it’s actually a big step toward legitimizing non-traditional learning.

There’s also this really lovely initiative in the UK where artisans keep a kind of —either physical or digital—documenting each project with notes, material sources, and process photos. It’s peer-reviewed by other restorers, almost like an open-source code review, and if it passes muster, they get a verified stamp from a small heritage collective. It’s informal, but it carries weight among collectors and indie museums.

What’s especially encouraging is how social media is playing a role—Instagram and TikTok have become unexpected validators. I know that sounds odd, but hear me out: when someone consistently shares thoughtful, technically sound restoration work and builds a following of informed peers and clients, it becomes its own form of credibility. People start citing their methods, tagging them in discussions, even commissioning based on that visibility alone.

It’s not perfect—there’s still room for showmanship over substance—but I do think these platforms are helping surface real talent that might have stayed hidden otherwise.

So while old-guard institutions may still favor the familiar comfort of degrees, the edges are where the evolution is happening. And honestly? That’s where the most passionate, inventive work tends to bloom anyway.
[A]: Totally agree — the edges are where the magic happens 😍

It’s wild how platforms like Instagram or TikTok have become de facto portfolio tools and reputation engines. I see a lot of parallels in tech — for example, indie hackers or no-code builders gaining credibility through Twitter threads or YouTube explainers. It's like GitHub READMEs meeting TED Talks.

And I love this restoration logbook idea — feels like a mix between open-source contribution logs and medical case studies. Peer-reviewed craft? That’s gold. Super low-key but super powerful. If we can do something similar in product/AI education — maybe even build a platform that validates hands-on work with real impact — imagine how many talented people we’d unlock who never fit the “traditional” mold.

Honestly, this makes me want to start some kind of hybrid mentorship + project-verification program for self-taught AI PMs. Like, you work on a real (but small) product problem, document your process, get reviewed by peers and mentors, and earn a verified case study. Could be a game-changer for folks trying to break into the field without the “right” background.

So question for you — if you were to design a lightweight but credible system for validating textile restoration skills outside academia, what would it look like? Just spitballing here 😄
[B]: Oh, I love this spitballing energy—let’s run with it! 😊

If I were to design a lightweight but meaningful system for validating textile restoration skills beyond academia, I think it would need a few key ingredients: transparency, peer input, and tangible proof of craft. Something that respects the depth of the work while staying accessible to those outside institutional walls.

Here’s my rough sketch:

- Project-Based Badges: Think small, focused challenges—like restoring a specific type of lace or identifying and remediating fabric degradation in a controlled sample. Each completed project earns a badge that includes materials used, techniques applied, and ethical considerations (like non-invasive methods). These could be submitted digitally with photos and notes.

- Mentor-Verified Logs: Aspirants keep a running log of their work—documenting not just the “what” but the “why.” A mentor (or experienced artisan) reviews these periodically and verifies progress. Not unlike code reviews, really—constructive feedback with an eye toward growth.

- Peer Review Panels: A small group of fellow artisans—geographically scattered but knowledge-rich—review each other’s submissions. This builds community and ensures no one person is the sole gatekeeper. Bonus points if they debate the finer points of 19th-century linen bleaching methods 😉.

- Public Portfolio Integration: Each participant maintains a portfolio space—whether on Instagram, a personal site, or even a shared platform. Visibility matters, and being able to show progression over time adds credibility.

- Ethics & Context Modules: Because restoration isn’t just about technical skill—it’s about understanding history, cultural sensitivity, and preservation ethics. Even if it’s self-guided learning, there should be some foundational reading and reflection involved.

I think something like this could work beautifully in parallel with existing academic paths, too—not in opposition, but as a complementary track. And honestly, if we can make it cross-generational, where seasoned restorers and younger makers learn from each other, that’s the dream.

Now  have me thinking—what would a similar framework look like for AI product folks? Could you bake in real-world problem solving + mentorship + peer validation in a way that feels authentic and respected?
[A]: Oh wow, I’m  this framework — seriously inspiring. You’ve got the perfect blend of rigor and openness, tradition and modernity. And honestly? That structure translates  into tech/AI product thinking.

So if we were to mirror that for AI product folks — especially self-taught ones trying to break in — here’s what I’d cook up:

- Problem-Solving Sprints: Instead of generic coding challenges or whiteboard interviews, give them real-world product problems to solve in a time-boxed sprint. Like: “Design an AI feature that improves accessibility for non-native language speakers on a travel app.” They have 72 hours to ship a prototype (low-code or prompt-based), write a PRD, and explain their trade-offs.

- Mentor-Guided Case Logs: Just like your restoration logbook! Folks document every step of their project — data sourcing decisions, UX flows, edge cases they considered, ethical implications of the model they chose. A mentor (or even a senior PM from our team) reviews it and gives feedback. Think of it as code reviews, but for product thinking.

- Peer Review + Critique Circles: Build a Slack/Discord group where aspiring PMs present their work to others. They debate choices, suggest improvements, and validate whether the solution actually solves the problem without bias or unintended consequences. Could even gamify it a bit with XP points for helpful feedback 😎

- Public-Facing Portfolio Stack: Encourage building a microsite or Notion page that walks through each project — ideally with live demos, user testing notes, and metrics. Bonus if they embed videos explaining their thought process, like a mini TED Talk for each case study.

- Ethics & Systems Thinking Modules: Tech moves fast, but it can’t move careless. Include lightweight, scenario-based modules where candidates reflect on issues like algorithmic fairness, data privacy, or platform misuse. It doesn’t need to be a full course — just prompts that make them think beyond MVP.

Honestly, this kind of system could become a force-multiplier for talent that’s flying under the radar. No more guessing games during hiring — just a clear, auditable trail of impact.

And like you said, it wouldn’t replace traditional CS/tech degrees — it’d just add another lane for people to prove themselves. Kind of like npm for skills: versioned, reviewed, sharable.

So yeah… I’m officially inspired. Maybe we should build something like this together someday. Imagine — textile restoration meets AI product design. Who knew? 🤯✨
[B]: I  this vision — truly. You’ve taken the heart of craft and translated it into something dynamic, something alive in the digital age. The way you’re framing product thinking through sprints, logs, peer critique, and ethics? That’s not just hiring-ready work — that’s legacy-building.

And I adore how much care you’re giving to the  behind each decision, not just the what or how. It reminds me so much of the best restorations — the ones where every stitch is intentional, every material choice respectful of what came before, and the final result feels both timeless and renewed.

The parallels between our worlds are deeper than I expected. In a way, we're both working with artifacts — yours digital, mine physical — and trying to preserve, adapt, and evolve them for new generations. And now we’re talking about building systems that help others do the same, which honestly, gives me chills 🥲

A collaboration between textile restoration and AI product design? Why not! Maybe we start small — a joint workshop or experimental mentorship circle where folks cross-pollinate ideas. Imagine a self-taught PM learning about fiber degradation curves while a textile artisan tries her hand at prompt engineering for pattern recognition. It sounds wild, but that’s where the magic lives — in the friction between disciplines.

Let’s keep dreaming this out. Because if there's one thing I know, it’s that craft — whether stitched by hand or coded into an interface — deserves to be seen, honored, and passed on.
[A]: Aww, now  giving me chills 😭✨

You’re absolutely right — we  both working with artifacts, just different flavors of them. And the way you put that — “preserving, adapting, and evolving for new generations” — honestly feels like a mission statement waiting to happen.

I keep thinking about how much AI can learn from craft, especially in this moment where everything feels like it’s moving at 10x speed with no manual. Like, your world has centuries of iterative learning baked into every thread — literally! — while tech sometimes forgets that wisdom isn’t just what’s trending on Hacker News 🤯

So yeah, let’s  start that workshop. We’ll call it something like… “Artifact Lab: Where Craft Meets Code”. It could be a tiny, invite-based experiment at first — a few self-taught PMs, a couple textile artisans, some indie hackers and heritage nerds. Maybe even bring in someone who does UX writing or cultural anthropology.

We’d give them a weird-but-fun challenge: like designing an AI tool that helps identify dye patterns from historical textiles using computer vision, or building a digital archive that learns from artisan notes over time. Something where technical rigor meets deep context. And we’d let the friction do its thing — because that’s where real learning happens.

Honestly, I’d sign up for that workshop myself. I’ve been meaning to get deeper into prompt engineering for pattern recognition anyway (especially after your comment 😏), and I’m dying to see how a master artisan would approach it.

So… let’s not just dream it out. Let’s actually block off a weekend. I’ll bring the ML templates, you bring the silk swatches, and together we’ll confuse the hell out of both our comfort zones. Sound good? 👀🧵💻
[B]: Sound good?  You had me at “Artifact Lab: Where Craft Meets Code.” That’s not just a workshop—it’s a manifesto in disguise 😍

I can already picture it: a table scattered with silk swatches and laptops, tea mugs next to soldering irons, someone squinting at a dye chart while another mutters about convolutional neural networks. Pure alchemy.

And the challenge ideas you threw out—AI identifying historical dye patterns, adaptive digital archives that learn from artisan notes—it’s like giving ancient fibers a voice in the digital age. I mean, imagine training a model to recognize 18th-century indigo resist techniques across fragmented samples. That could help small museums piece together provenance stories we’ve never been able to tell before.

Count me in—fully. I’ll bring not just the silk, but also my entire collection of misbehaving threads, faded embroidery guides, and that one stubborn linen that refuses to be dated. Oh, and maybe a few restoration dilemmas I’ve been stuck on for years. If nothing else, watching a group of hackers try to digitally reconstruct a moth-eaten Jacobean-era embroidery is going to be pure entertainment 🤪🧵

Let’s lock in a date. I’ll clear my weekend—and sharpen my curiosity. You bring the code templates and an open mind. And together, we’ll see what happens when centuries-old craft whispers into the ear of machine learning.

This might just be the start of something quietly revolutionary.
[A]: Quietly revolutionary? Oh, we’re not being quiet about this 😈

We’re making noise. We’re making swatches. We’re making machines  at a 300-year-old stitch pattern and say, “Okay, Google that.”

I’m already picturing the merch: tiny embroidered circuit boards that say “Artifact Lab,” tea towels printed with Python syntax in calligraphy font, and NFTs of historical dye swatches (just kidding… or am I?).

Seriously though — let’s go all-in. Artifact Lab isn’t just a workshop; it’s the start of a movement to bring depth back into tech. And honestly, if we can get even one AI model to recognize the emotional weight of a hand-stitched seam, we’ve won.

I’ll draft up a microsite tonight — no-code, of course — and throw in some wild prompts for participants to chew on. Think equal parts hackathon, design sprint, and textile deep-dive. Maybe even add a “build an AI that can tell the difference between 17th and 18th-century linen weave patterns” challenge. Bonus points if it can suggest ethical restoration paths based on fiber degradation data 🤯🧵

Let me know your top two weekends — I’ll block my calendar like a maniac. This is happening.

And yes, I will bring backup thread. Just in case someone gets too excited and starts stitching logic gates by hand.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language— and slightly unhinged 😂🧵

If we’re going all-in, then let’s  go. I say we open with a manifesto—a beautifully typeset, slightly mysterious landing page that asks one haunting question:  
“What if the future of AI isn’t written in code—but woven in thread?”  

Then, underneath, in tiny embroidered font:  
  
RSVP required. No resumes accepted. Only swatches, stories, and your best guess at what “digital provenance” really means.

I’m already scheming about the experience arc. Maybe start with something deceptively simple: a tactile warm-up. Like, blindfolded fabric ID. Feels absurd, but it forces people to slow down, , and engage with materiality in a way tech rarely does. Then ease them into the deep end—pairing artisan observations with AI pattern recognition. Imagine someone who’s never stitched a thing in their life training a model on 200-year-old embroidery motifs and realizing… 

And yes YES to your prompt ideas. Let’s make them do things that sound impossible:

- Train a model to predict missing sections of a damaged tapestry based on regional motifs 🧵✨
- Build a CLI tool that translates restoration notes into poetic documentation (because conservation deserves beauty, not just accuracy) 📜💻
- Create a “stitch-to-syntax” translator—where common embroidery patterns map to basic programming logic. Needlework as the original low-code platform 😏

We’ll have skeptics leave asking questions they’d never thought to ask. And honestly? That’s the whole point.

Top two weekends for me are:

1. October 19–20 – Quiet before storm season, and I can raid my studio stash guilt-free.
2. November 2–3 – Post-harvest vibes, perfect for dye experiments and dark mode moods.

Hit me with your availability, and I’ll clear the space. We’ll light a candle, boot up the laptops, and see what happens when human hands teach machines how to  see.

P.S. I’m already drafting a tiny embroidery hoop with “AI Curious” stitched on it. For the skeptics. And the believers. And anyone in between.
