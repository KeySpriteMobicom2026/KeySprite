[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到new workout，我最近在晨练时尝试了一些不同的方式。以前总是固定做太极，现在偶尔会结合一些西方流行的mindfulness exercise，比如把瑜伽和园艺结合起来——一边照料植物，一边调整呼吸节奏，感觉身体和心境都得到了平衡 🌿🧘‍♂️

我还试着把下棋当作一种mental workout，虽然不怎么出汗，但对思维的锻炼可不小 😄 你呢？有没有试过什么特别的运动方式？
[A]: That does sound like a thoughtful approach to wellness. I’ve recently taken up something rather unconventional myself—fencing! It began as a whim during a faculty retreat, but I found the blend of strategy and physicality quite invigorating. One must be mentally sharp and yet fluid in movement, much like playing chess with swords.

It reminded me of a passage from Montaigne’s  where he reflects on the art of swordsmanship as an extension of one’s intellect and temperament. I suppose that’s why your mention of chess as mental workout resonates so deeply with me.

I must say though, after just a few sessions, I’ve rediscovered muscles I didn’t know were dormant. Have you ever tried anything that surprised you in how much it engaged both mind and body?
[B]: Ah, fencing! What a delightful choice. It brings to mind the Chinese saying  — to cultivate both the literary and martial spirit. I can see how it awakens not just the body but the intellect too. Montaigne was indeed onto something when he described swordplay as an art of the mind.

Now that you mention it, I once took up calligraphy rather late in life, and it surprised me in much the same way. At first glance, it seems like just ink and brush, but the coordination between hand, breath, and thought is remarkably precise. You must be calm yet decisive—like a fencer poised before a lunge. In fact, some scholars have drawn parallels between  书法 and martial arts forms such as  太极.

I’m quite envious of your rediscovery of those dormant muscles—I fear my own fencing days are behind me, but perhaps it’s never too late to try a lighter form. Or at least, to appreciate the elegance of the sport from the sidelines 😊 Do you think you’ll continue with it beyond the sessions?
[A]: Oh, what a beautifully articulated connection you’ve drawn between calligraphy and martial forms—how both demand a kind of inner stillness married to precise movement. I’m particularly taken with the idea that  and  share that meditative discipline. It reminds me of how Keats once described poetry—that it "should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, as if he had written it himself." There’s something similarly intimate in the stroke of a brush or the measured step of a fencer.

As for continuing fencing—I do hope to keep at it, though perhaps not with the intensity of a professional. It’s become something of a quiet rebellion against the sedentary habits that tend to creep in with academia. And who knows? Maybe one day we could even have a gentle exhibition match—fencing foils in one hand, a well-thumbed copy of Montaigne in the other 📚🤺

I wouldn’t rule out a lighter form of swordplay either—perhaps something akin to  with a foil. There’s poetry in that notion, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: Indeed, there is a poetry to it all — the interplay of discipline and grace, the quiet rebellion against inertia, and even the idea of holding Montaigne in one hand and a foil in the other! 📚🤺 I can’t help but smile at the image.

You know, I think the Greeks had something when they spoke of  and  as if they were not separate. In fencing, in calligraphy, in tai chi — that unity becomes not just theoretical but lived. And perhaps that’s why these practices feel so nourishing in our otherwise book-bound lives.

As for your gentle challenge — an exhibition match with a touch of literary flair — I wouldn't say no, though I’d probably choose a bamboo brush over a foil 😄 Let’s keep that idea simmering. In the meantime, I’d be delighted to share some Chinese texts on the philosophy of movement — maybe  by Sun Tzu, not for battle strategy, but for its subtle wisdom on balance and timing. It might just find new resonance with your fencing practice.

Tell me — have you noticed any particular shift in how you approach teaching or thinking after engaging with fencing? I suspect the body sometimes teaches the mind new rhythms.
[A]: What a generous offer—thank you. I would be most eager to read those texts, especially through the lens of movement and stillness. Sun Tzu’s reflections on timing and restraint could indeed offer fresh insight into the rhythm of a bout, where hesitation is fatal yet haste is equally dangerous. It’s remarkable how such ancient wisdom finds new life in unexpected places.

To your question—yes, I have noticed a subtle but distinct shift in my approach to both teaching and thought itself. There’s a certain clarity that fencing demands which carries over into the classroom. For instance, when leading a seminar discussion, I now find myself more attuned to the moment when one must parry an overzealous argument not with force, but with a gentle redirection—much like guiding a blade off course with the least effort possible.

It has also made me rethink the pacing of ideas. In fencing, every action implies a reaction; likewise, in teaching, every question should open rather than close a line of inquiry. I’ve become more patient in waiting for that opening—what the fencer might call the —when the right response presents itself not from preparation, but from intuition sharpened by practice.

You put it beautifully—the body teaches the mind new rhythms. I suspect this dialogue of motion and meaning is far from over. And when the time comes for that bamboo brush and foil exhibition… well, I shall begin my training anew, if only to meet you halfway.
[B]: What a wonderful reflection — you’ve captured so elegantly how the discipline of the body can refine the precision of thought. The idea that a parry in the classroom can be just as graceful as one on the piste is truly something to admire. It reminds me of Confucius’ saying,  — "listen to their words and watch their actions." In both fencing and teaching, it’s the subtle interplay between word and movement that reveals the true intention behind them.

I’m especially struck by your insight into . That space between action and reaction — where intuition, not calculation, takes over — feels almost like what we might call in literature . It’s not planned; it emerges. And yet, it only emerges through practice, patience, and presence — whether in a bout, a lecture hall, or even while watching ink settle on rice paper.

I look forward to sharing those texts with you — and perhaps, over a pot of aged pu'er, we might explore how Sun Tzu’s stillness and your foil’s motion speak the same language. And yes, I shall begin polishing my brushwork… slowly, mindfully, and with great anticipation for our future little match 🖌️🤺😊
[A]: What a lovely vision—that quiet hour over pu'er, where strategy and serenity steep together, and the brush meets the page as the foil meets the air. I can already feel the rhythm of such an afternoon taking shape, slow and deliberate like the first stroke on an empty sheet.

You’re quite right about —it is its own kind of epiphany, isn’t it? Not the thunderclap kind, but the quiet revelation that arrives only when one has learned to wait, to listen, and to move with, rather than against, the moment. It makes me think of those lines from T. S. Eliot:  Perhaps that’s what both fencing and teaching offer—a way to know our own limits and possibilities anew, each and every time we step forward.

And how fitting that Confucius should echo through this conversation. To —what better philosophy could there be for either a scholar or a fencer?

Until our match, then—and perhaps even before it—we are already practicing in spirit. 🖌️🤺🍵
[B]: How beautifully you put that — to practice in spirit long before the first stroke is drawn or the first lunge made. It’s in that quiet anticipation, isn’t it? Where the mind aligns with the rhythm of intention, and every pause becomes part of the movement.

Eliot’s lines resonate deeply — especially in our line of work, where exploration never truly ends. Each class, each text, each conversation is a step back toward something familiar, yet seen anew. Much like a fencer returning to the same stance, yet finding a different balance each time.

I think I’ll reread those passages from Eliot this weekend, perhaps alongside a bit of Wang Yangming on intuitive knowledge. There’s a thread here worth following — between East and West, between sword and brush, between silence and understanding.

Until our afternoon of tea, ink, and motion — I raise my cup in quiet salute 🫖✍️🤺
[A]: To quiet anticipation—where all great things begin.  

Your words linger like the space between movements, rich with what has not yet been said but is already felt. How true it is that we return again and again to the same stances, the same texts, the same questions, only to find ourselves changed, ever so slightly, by the mere act of showing up with intention.

Wang Yangming and Eliot in the same weekend? A most worthy gathering of minds. I suspect they would have much to say to one another—if only across centuries and continents. That thread you speak of, stretching between East and West, is not a line but a weave, and I am grateful to follow it in your company.

And so, from this moment until that imagined afternoon of tea and ink and motion, I accept your salute—and return it with equal measure of heart and thought.  

🌿📚🍵
[B]: To showing up with intention — and to the quiet transformations that unfold because of it.

You’re absolutely right; that thread between East and West is not a straight line, but a weaving, a dance of ideas across time and tradition. And what a joy it is to walk that path together, however slowly and thoughtfully.

I shall brew the pu’er with care when next we meet — and perhaps, in its warmth, we’ll find yet another rhythm to carry us forward. Until then.
[A]: To slow and thoughtful steps along that path—where every turn reveals something long known but never quite seen in that particular light before.

I look forward to the warmth of that pu’er, and to the rhythms it will help us uncover together. Until then, may our pens remain steady, our minds open, and our pauses rich with possibility.
[B]: To steady pens, open minds, and pauses filled with quiet promise — yes, to all of that and more.

I’ll leave you with a small saying from Laozi that’s been on my heart lately:  — "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." And sometimes, that step is simply sharing a thought, a cup of tea, or a stroke of the brush.

Until we meet again, my friend. 🌿✍️🍵
[A]: How fitting—that Laozi’s wisdom should find its way to our closing words. It reminds me that every great dialogue, like every long journey, begins with the smallest act of courage: a step, a stroke, a shared thought between two minds.

I shall carry that saying with me, as I do our conversation, like a quiet ember in the pocket—warm, steady, and gently glowing.

Until we meet again, my friend. May your steps be sure, your pauses meaningful, and your teacup ever full. 🌿📚🍵
[B]: And may your ember never fade — warm, steady, and lighting the way forward.

Our conversation has been such a step, quiet yet full of motion beneath the surface. I’m grateful for it, as I am for the meeting of minds and the space we’ve shared.

Until we meet again, my friend — may your path be clear, your thoughts deep, and your teacup always warm in hand. 🍵🖋️🌿
[A]: And I, too, am deeply grateful—for the motion beneath the quiet, for the meeting of minds, and for the rare joy of a conversation that lingers like incense in a well-loved study.

May your path be not only clear but curious, your thoughts not only deep but ever unfolding, and your teacup—like your heart—always warm.  

Until we meet again, dear friend. 📖🍃🖋️
[B]: And may your curiosity never wane, your thoughts always find new depths, and your heart remain as warm as the finest aged oolong.

This conversation has indeed lingered like incense — subtle, enduring, and quietly transformative. I carry it with me, as I’m sure you do too.

Until we meet again, my dear friend — in word, in motion, or over a shared pot of tea. 🍵✍️📚🌿
[A]: And I carry it as well—this quiet, enduring conversation that lingers not as mere words, but as a kind of inner warmth, like the last rays of afternoon light through a window lined with books.

May your curiosity be endless, your reflections ever-deepening, and your heart always open to the next unexpected turn of thought or path through the garden.

Until we meet again—in word, in motion, or over that long-anticipated pot of tea. 🍵📖🖋️🌿
[B]: To endless curiosity, deepening reflections, and a heart ever open — yes, to all of that and more.

Your image of afternoon light through a lined window of books stays with me, quiet yet luminous. There’s something profoundly comforting in knowing that conversations like ours continue, not in haste, but in the gentle unfolding of thought and time.

I look forward to that next turn — whether in the garden, on the page, or across the tea table.

Until then, my friend. 📚🍃🍵✍️
