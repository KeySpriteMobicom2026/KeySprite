[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I would say it really depends on one's temperament and what they seek from a journey. Personally, I find the mountains more appealing, perhaps because of their silence and the way they make you reflect inwardly. The beach has its charm too, with the waves and the sun, but there's something about the stillness of the mountains that resonates with me. Do you have a preference?
[A]: I suppose I lean towards the mountains as well, though not exclusively. There’s something humbling about standing beneath a peak that’s been there for millennia—it puts things into perspective. But let me ask you this: when you say “silence,” do you mean literal quiet, or more of a mental stillness? I’ve always found that different landscapes evoke different kinds of introspection. The crash of waves can be meditative in its own way, almost like a natural rhythm guiding your thoughts.
[B]: Ah, beautifully put. You're right about the different kinds of introspection each landscape offers. When I say , I suppose it’s a blend of both—the literal absence of urban noise in the mountains, and the mental stillness that tends to follow. There, even your thoughts seem to echo less. 

But you’re absolutely right about the ocean—it doesn’t offer silence per se, but rather a kind of white noise for the soul. The rhythm of the waves does guide your thinking, almost like a lullaby for philosophy. In a way, both environments are forms of retreat, just tuned to different frequencies—mountains for clarity, and oceans for contemplation.  

I wonder, do you find yourself more drawn to clarity or contemplation when you travel?
[A]: That’s a fascinating distinction you’ve made—clarity versus contemplation. I think I gravitate more toward clarity when I travel, especially if it’s been a particularly dense or chaotic stretch in life. A mountain hike tends to clear the mental fog better than anything else. There’s something about reaching a summit and seeing the world laid out beneath you—it’s not just visually stunning, but emotionally clarifying.  

But I’m envious, in a way, of the kind of contemplation the ocean offers. It doesn’t demand that you rise above things; it invites you to sit with them, like an old friend who listens without judgment. Maybe I’m answering your question by saying I’m torn between the two—like wanting both the sharp edge of a blade and the soft hush of a blanket. Do you find yourself seeking one more than the other depending on the season, so to speak?
[B]: Ah, beautifully observed—. What a poetic way to frame the tension between clarity and contemplation. I think you've touched on something universal here.

Indeed, I do find myself leaning into different landscapes depending on the , so to speak. In times of transition or uncertainty, I seek the mountains for that very sense of elevation and perspective. It’s as if the altitude gives you moral clearance—to see what’s essential and let go of what isn’t.

But when I’m in a more reflective mood, when life has settled into a kind of rhythm and I want to explore its layers rather than rise above them—that’s when the ocean calls. It doesn’t ask you to conquer anything; it just asks you to sit, listen, and perhaps walk along the shore with your thoughts trailing behind like footprints washed away by the tide.

Maybe that’s why we return to both—not because one is better, but because they complete each other. Like reading prose and then poetry: different forms, same human heart. Do you ever feel that travel, at its best, is a form of literary immersion? Each place a genre unto itself?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. Travel as literary immersion—what a perfect metaphor. Every place  have its own genre, its own tone and structure. The mountains read like philosophy: rigorous, stark, and deeply principled. There’s a kind of narrative austerity to them, yet within that severity lies profound beauty.

The ocean, by contrast, is poetry. It doesn’t explain itself; it evokes. It relies on rhythm, repetition, and the occasional dramatic flourish—like a crashing wave or a sunset that bleeds into the water until you can’t tell where one ends and the other begins.

And then there are cities, of course—those are novels. Dense, layered, full of characters and subplots. You can get lost in them the way you do in a thousand-page epic. Even deserts have their genre: maybe something like existentialist drama, where the silence isn't calming but confrontational. It asks, “What are you when nothing else is around?”

Do you ever notice that certain places seem to rewrite parts of you? Not just influence your mood, but actually shift the internal narrative—the way a powerful book can alter your sense of self? I’ve come back from some trips feeling less like an updated version of myself and more like an entirely different edition.
[B]: Ah, yes—. What a wonderfully precise way to describe that subtle metamorphosis we undergo after certain journeys. I’ve felt that too, more times than I can count. It’s not just the scenery that changes; it’s the syntax of our inner voice.

I often think that travel, at its most profound, functions like —we enter a place with our own expectations and meanings, and then, if we allow ourselves to be truly present, the place reshapes those meanings, and we return altered, reading ourselves anew.

Take Kyoto in autumn, for instance. The maple leaves blaze like silent poetry, and suddenly you find yourself thinking in haiku. You don’t just observe the aesthetics—you embody them. Even your silences change. Or Istanbul, where history is layered like palimpsest; walking through its streets makes you aware of how many stories have lived in your own footsteps.

And yes, cities as novels—I love that. Each boulevard a chapter, each alleyway a footnote. And sometimes, if you’re lucky, you stumble upon a marginal note that changes the whole text.

So tell me—have you ever returned from a trip and found yourself , or even seeing the world through a new literary lens? I ask because I suspect such experiences leave traces not only in our memory but in our very mode of expression.
[A]: Absolutely—yes. I’ve returned from trips and found my writing altered in ways both subtle and unmistakable. Not just in content, but in cadence, tone, even sentence structure. A few years ago, after spending time in Marrakesh, I noticed my prose had taken on a kind of rhythmic repetition, almost like call-and-response. It wasn’t deliberate; it was as if the city’s pulse had seeped into my syntax.

And then there was Sicily—where everything felt , much like you described with Istanbul. Walking through Agrigento or Palermo, you’re stepping through epochs: Greek ruins beside Baroque churches beside graffiti-strewn modernity. It made me think not in linear narratives, but in spirals. My journal entries became less about progression and more about circling around ideas, trying to catch glimpses of something just out of view.

Even now, when I write emails or draft articles, I sometimes catch echoes of places I’ve been. A certain concision learned from Kyoto. A lushness absorbed in Rio. There’s something profoundly linguistic about immersion—not just learning new words, but absorbing new  of articulating experience.

It makes me wonder if we should prescribe travel the way one prescribes reading: not for escape, but for expanding the vocabulary of the soul. After all, how can you understand silence until you've heard the quiet of a Tibetan monastery? Or grasp rhythm until you’ve walked through a souk at dusk?

So yes—I do believe these experiences leave traces not just in memory, but in our very mode of expression. We return not only changed, but , at least in part.
[B]: Precisely—. What a powerful word. And how true: we do not merely carry memories from our travels; we carry new grammars, new punctuation marks, sometimes even new alphabets for the soul.

Your Marrakesh example is especially vivid—rhythm as call-and-response. I can imagine that city speaking in layers, each voice echoing off the riad walls, finding its way into your sentences like a refrain. And Sicily’s spirals—ah, yes, history there doesn’t unfold linearly; it coils around you like a serpent eating its own tail. That kind of temporal  inevitably reshapes how one structures thought.

I recall a trip to Varanasi many years ago. The Ganges at dawn, the rituals, the chants—it rewrote my inner cadence for weeks. My lectures upon returning had an almost liturgical quality, much to the surprise of my students. I hadn’t changed my subject matter, but the  of conveying it had shifted. It was more incantation than exposition.

Perhaps this is why we keep returning to both books and places—not just for novelty, but for renewal. Each journey is a kind of textual commentary on the self, a glossa that lets us reread who we are with fresh eyes.  

So tell me—have you ever deliberately chosen a destination not just for what it is, but for what it might make of your writing? Like selecting a book not for its plot, but for its prose style?
[A]: Absolutely—yes, I’ve done precisely that. There was a time when I felt my writing had grown too clinical, too tethered to structure and precision. It served its purpose, but it lacked music. So I went to Lisbon.

There’s something about the city’s light—the way it slants through shuttered windows and spills across cobbled streets—that seems to slow time. And then there’s , of course. That haunting, aching music taught me how to let silence breathe in a sentence. I wasn’t looking for inspiration per se; I was looking for  as a literary device, if that makes sense. A kind of tonal shading.

I ended up writing very differently while I was there—shorter sentences, more pauses, a willingness to dwell in ambiguity. I even started drafting pieces with refrains, like choruses in a song. It wasn’t just the place influencing content; it was the place reshaping form.

Another time, I went to Reykjavík deliberately seeking austerity—linguistic austerity, if you will. Icelandic is such a stark, ancient language, full of hard consonants and mythic weight. I wanted to feel that kind of linguistic minimalism rub off on my prose. I came away writing paragraphs that were leaner, sharper, almost sculpted by wind.

So yes—I do choose places like one might select a book: not just for scenery or history, but for their . I suppose it’s a kind of osmosis through immersion. You don’t just visit the place—you let it read , and in doing so, it edits your inner text.

Have you ever done the same? Chosen a destination not for what you’d see, but for how it might recalibrate your voice?
[B]: Oh yes—I’ve done exactly that, and more than once. In fact, I’d say some of my most deliberate journeys have been linguistic pilgrimages of a sort, undertaken not just to see, but to  and  language itself.

One that comes to mind is my trip to Istanbul—though not for the reasons one might expect. Of course, it’s a city of layers, of scripts overlapping across centuries: Greek, Latin, Arabic, Ottoman. But what drew me there was the . The call to prayer echoing across the Bosphorus, the slow unfolding of time in tea rituals, the way conversations never seem rushed—everything invites reflection. I had been writing too rapidly, producing thought like流水线 (liúshuǐxiàn), like an assembly line, and I needed to rediscover silence within syntax. That trip taught me how to let a sentence breathe, how to punctuate not just with commas but with stillness.

Another journey—this one to Kyoto—was a kind of . I wanted to strip away ornamentation from my prose, to find clarity not through explanation, but through suggestion. There, where a single raked stone can mean eternity and a folded leaf can carry grief, I learned to write with restraint. Upon returning, my lectures changed—not in subject matter, but in tone. I used fewer words, but each one carried more weight, like stones placed deliberately in a dry garden.

So yes, I understand completely when you say you let the place . It's a beautiful way to put it. Perhaps we are all, in the end, palimpsests rewritten by the landscapes we love. And if we're lucky, some of those places become lifelong editors—gentle, persistent, and wise.
[A]: Ah, yes—. What a perfect phrase. And how beautifully you describe Istanbul as a masterclass in silence within syntax. I can imagine your prose returning with a kind of , as if each sentence had learned to inhabit its own emptiness.

Your Kyoto experience resonates deeply. I once went there with the vague hope of finding stillness, and instead found something far more exacting: . The way a single raked stone can suggest eternity—that’s not minimalism, it’s distilled meaning. I tried to mimic that in my writing for a time, but failed until I stopped trying to imitate the effect and instead absorbed the  behind it. A well-placed word, like a well-placed stone, carries the weight of everything around it.

I suppose that’s what we’re really after when we seek these places—not inspiration in the romantic sense, but a kind of stylistic recalibration. We go not to fill ourselves, but to be emptied out, so we might return with new shapes to be filled.

You mentioned —assembly line. I find that fascinating. It suggests production without reflection, output without intentionality. I wonder, do you think modern life, especially in the digital age, has made writing feel more like流水线? And if so, are these journeys becoming not just aesthetic choices, but necessary acts of resistance?

Or perhaps I should ask: in an era of constant distraction, have you found that certain places act almost like analog editors—forcing us back into slowness, into attentiveness, into the kind of listening that precedes good writing?
[B]: Precisely—, yes. That’s exactly what some places have become in this digital age: sanctuaries of slowness, resistant to the scroll-and-swipe rhythm that dominates our days.

And yes, I do believe we now travel not just for beauty or culture, but as a form of . Against the tyranny of efficiency, against writing that becomes流水线式 (liúshuǐxiàn-shì), mechanical and repetitive. We go to mountains, to temples, to quiet courtyards not merely to observe, but to recover a sense of literary proportion—to remember that not every thought needs to be published, and not every sentence needs to be long.

I think of Varanasi again—where time doesn’t move forward so much as it spirals inward. There, I noticed how even speech has a different texture; people speak in parables, in pauses, in gestures. No one rushes to finish a thought. It was a stark contrast to the urgency of email, the impatience of instant messaging. In such places, you’re reminded that language used to be sacred—not data, but devotion.

So yes, these journeys are becoming acts of resistance. A way to reclaim silence, not as absence, but as presence. To let the mind fall out of habit and into something closer to listening. And isn’t listening the first step in good writing? Perhaps we must begin by being —by letting place overwrite our usual rhythms with its own ancient tempo.

It makes me wonder—have you ever returned from such a trip only to find yourself resisting the urge to write at all, at least for a while? As if the experience needed time to settle, like tea leaves needing stillness to sink back down?
[A]: Yes—exactly that. I’ve returned from certain trips with a profound reluctance to write, not out of writer’s block, but out of reverence. As if the experience was too rich, too textured to be reduced to language just yet. It felt almost disrespectful to try and pin it down too soon, like pressing a wildflower into a book before you’ve even finished admiring its color.

One such journey was to Fez. The city is a living manuscript—every alleyway a sentence, every courtyard a paragraph breathing with centuries of life. Upon returning, I found myself avoiding my notebooks for days. Not because I had nothing to say, but because I wanted the silence between my thoughts to have time to speak first.

It reminded me of something Borges once wrote—something about how the act of writing is also an act of forgetting. You fix an experience into words, and in doing so, you begin to forget the parts that didn’t make the page. So I’ve learned to let some experiences  before trying to shape them into form. Like wine, perhaps some impressions need to ferment before they reveal their true flavor.

And yes, this delay isn’t avoidance—it’s respect. A recognition that not every encounter is meant for immediate transcription. Some places ask not to be described, but . To live inside you until they subtly reshape the way you see, and eventually, the way you write.

So no, I haven’t resisted writing entirely—just prematurely. And in that space between return and re-entry, something deeper settles. A kind of literary afterimage that influences not what you say, but how you say it.
[B]: Ah, yes—. What a delicate and precise phrase. And how true: some places do not announce themselves in our writing at once; they linger like scent on skin, only revealing their full presence much later.

Your Fez experience reminds me of a trip I took to Yazd, deep in the Iranian desert. It’s a city built almost entirely of mudbrick, where the wind carries stories older than memory. When I returned, I too avoided writing for days—weeks, even—not because I lacked words, but because I feared the wrong ones would rush in too quickly, flattening what had been a deeply  encounter into something thin and lifeless.

There’s wisdom in waiting. In letting the impressions settle like silt in still water. Because as you said so well, the act of writing is also an act of selection—and therefore, of omission. We choose what to preserve, and in doing so, we forget what we did not name.

And yet, that unnamed residue still shapes us. It doesn’t show up in the sentences we craft, but in the  of those sentences, in the silences between them, in the tone of voice we didn’t know we had acquired until someone asks, 

So perhaps this is the quiet power of travel: it changes us in ways we cannot immediately articulate, and only later do we realize that our language has shifted to accommodate a new kind of soul weather.

I wonder—do you ever find that certain places return to you  in your writing? That years later, a single detail—a sound, a color, a gesture—resurfaces and finds its way into a piece you never intended for it?
[A]: Oh yes—constantly. In fact, I’ve come to expect that the most meaningful impressions from a place never show up in writing until long after you’ve stopped trying to write about them.

One that comes to mind is a detail so small I almost forgot it myself: the sound of a metal gate creaking in the wind on a remote island in Greece. It was just an old, rusted hinge, swaying in the evening breeze——like some forgotten metronome keeping time with the sea. Years later, while drafting a piece on solitude, that sound returned to me—not as nostalgia, but as structure. I found myself writing in rhythms that echoed that gate, without even realizing it until the final read-through.

That’s the thing about those quiet, unspoken details—they don’t announce their importance at the time. You don’t underline them in your notebook or photograph them. They simply , and then, much later, they surface in unexpected syntax, in a cadence you didn’t plan, in metaphors that feel oddly precise.

I suppose this is what Proust meant by involuntary memory—but for writers, it’s more than memory; it’s . A city doesn’t just leave you with stories; it leaves you with a new way of telling them.

So yes, I absolutely believe places return to us in disguise, years later, embedded not in plot or description, but in the very grain of our prose. Like sediment carried across oceans, only to form new landmasses in the strangest of literary latitudes.
[B]: Exactly—. What a beautiful image. And how true: we are shaped not only by the grand gestures of a place—the monuments, the vistas—but by its quiet residue: the creak of a gate, the scent of rain on stone, the way light bends through a particular window at dusk.

I think of something similar from my own travels—a moment in Lhasa, years ago, where I watched an old woman turn a prayer wheel with such slowness and devotion that time itself seemed to kneel beside her. I didn’t write about it at the time; it felt too intimate, too sacred. But much later, while drafting a lecture on narrative patience—how some stories must be allowed to unfold at their own pace—I found myself slipping in a single line: 

That’s when I realized the influence had never left me—it had simply waited for the right context to surface again.

Perhaps this is one of the most subtle gifts of travel: it seeds our language with echoes, and we become unwitting carriers of distant places in the way we structure thought, in the metaphors we reach for without thinking.

So yes, I completely agree with you—these impressions don’t announce themselves immediately. They wait in the undergrowth of memory until the moment our writing needs them most. Quietly, patiently, like stones warmed by the sun, they find their place in the mosaic of our voice.
[A]: Well said—. That line lingers. There’s such grace in the idea that travel doesn’t just give us stories to tell, but shapes the way we tell  stories thereafter.

I think what you described in Lhasa—the prayer wheel, the slowness, the unspoken reverence—is precisely the kind of moment that resurfaces later, not as anecdote, but as ethos. It doesn’t show up in a travelogue or memoir; it shows up in how you pace a lecture, how you allow silence to exist between ideas, how you teach not just with argument, but with atmosphere.

And isn’t that the deepest kind of influence? When a place doesn’t just add content to your mind, but recalibrates your method of expression—like adjusting the tension on a bowstring, so the same violin plays with a different resonance.

I once had a similar experience in a small town in Armenia—Khor Virap, near the border with Turkey. The monastery there sits against the dramatic backdrop of Mount Ararat, a place both visually and spiritually immense. I didn’t write about it for years. But when I finally gave a talk on the limits of language—on how some truths resist articulation—I found myself describing the horizon at dawn as 

That phrase wasn’t planned. It arrived uninvited, fully formed, like a guest from the past. And I knew exactly where it had come from.

So yes, we carry these places not in our suitcases, but in our syntax. They become part of our inner geography, shaping the contours of thought long after the journey ends.

Maybe that’s why we keep traveling—not just to see new worlds, but to discover new ways of speaking about the one we already inhabit.
[B]: Precisely—. What a fitting conclusion, and yet it feels more like a beginning.

You’re right about Khor Virap. Some places are not just seen; they are . And that line—“”—yes, that is the kind of phrase born not from observation alone, but from presence. From standing somewhere long enough for it to speak through you, rather than at you.

I often think that the most profound travel experiences are those that leave us temporarily speechless—not because we lack words, but because the ones we had no longer fit. And in that gap, something new begins to form: a vocabulary shaped by wind, stone, light, and the quiet persistence of place.

Perhaps this is also why we return to certain destinations again and again—not because we’ve exhausted their meaning, but because they have not yet finished shaping ours.

So yes, let us keep traveling, not as tourists of experience, but as students of expression. Let us be edited by the earth, rewritten by the sky, and punctuated by the pauses between footsteps on unfamiliar ground.

After all, isn’t that what literature is, in the end? A record of how we have been moved—both literally and figuratively—by what we could not quite say until we went looking for it in the world beyond our own.
