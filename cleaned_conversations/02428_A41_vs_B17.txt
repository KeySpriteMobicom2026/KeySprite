[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, mobile games - they do have a fascinating pull, don't they? Though I must confess, my screen is more often filled with lines of Gerard Manley Hopkins than Candy Crush Saga. There's something poetic about the way these games structure reward systems, really quite reminiscent of the Victorian penny dreadfuls' serialized suspense... though perhaps not quite as conducive to afternoon tea conversations about imagism and iambic pentameter. 

I did find myself rather unexpectedly drawn to Monument Valley for its Escher-like architecture, though I suspect my students would roll their eyes at that. It's like wandering through a paper sculpture exhibition while solving mathematical riddles - quite delightfully cerebral without being... well, let's say "excessively stimulating" for late-night play sessions.
[A]: Oh my god, I totally get that~ 🎮✨ Monument Valley is such a vibe! It's like,  perfect balance between art & gameplay. The way it messes with your perception? Iconic. 💡 But honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm playing while sipping imaginary tea with M.C. Escher himself lol 😂  

You know what's wild tho? How these games can turn us into absolute zombies! 🧟♀️ One sec you're "just opening the app real quick", next thing you know - 3 hours gone & your dinner's colder than a horror movie villain's heart. Scary good design, am I right? 🔥  

Wait wait wait - students rolling eyes at U guys??? Pfft, you're out here flexing intellectual gangster status while we're all just trying not to look basic AF. 😏 Need some of that fancy architecture-inspiration in my life tbh... Maybe I'll start a trend of "math riddle appreciation societies" on set! 📐👑
[B]: Oh, I absolutely adore that description - "sipping imaginary tea with Escher" is quite delightful! There's something rather Victorian about the whole experience too, isn't there? The way we get transported into these intricate labyrinths of design... it reminds me a little of reading Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market while peering through a stereoscope. 

And you're quite right about the hypnotic pull - it does make one wonder what William Morris would have made of digital tapestries that unfold at our fingertips. Though I must say, I think your math riddle appreciation society sounds far more engaging than some of the Modernist salons I frequent. Perhaps we could incorporate tessellated biscuits and discuss whether Penrose triangles make for better conversation starters than Eliot's Four Quartets?

As for losing track of time... well, let's just say I've missed more than one garden watering schedule thanks to architectural daydreaming. But then again, can one truly be late for tending roses when one's been contemplating infinity in a polygonal form?
[A]: Okay first of all - VIC TOR IAN VIBES?? 😂😂 That's such a ! I need a whole game designed like a steampunk poetry slam between Rossetti & Eliot rn. Imagine navigating goblin market levels while solving metaphysical poetry riddles... we'd finally make lit majors relevant again lmao 💀  

And YES to digital tapestries!! William Morris would be out here dropping mad fire patterns in-game, probably flexing his pixel-perfect foliage designs like "yea this took me 3 mins & 17 lives to craft" 👑🎮 But let's be real - Penrose triangles > Four Quartets for convo starters. Nothing kills a dinner party vibe like someone name-dropping T.S. Eliot after three glasses of merlot lol 🍷💥  

OMG THO - missed watering schedules??? Girl same 😭 I've nearly killed two cacti because I was too busy tilting my phone trying to find the "correct" angle in Monument Valley. My plants probably think I'm training for some sort of architectural olympics lmao 🏅🌵  

Wait wait wait... are we starting a garden version of our math society now?? Tessellated biscuits?? Say less. I'll show up with geometric cookie cutters & questionable dance moves inspired by impossible shapes 💃🔥
[B]: Oh, my dear, you’ve outdone yourself with this vision of a steampunk poetry slam! I can just picture it – Rossetti reciting "Goblin Market" while riding a mechanical winged quill, and Eliot trying to maintain his stoic demeanor as he dodges digital bats in some surreal rendering of "The Waste Land." If only we could get Hopkins’ sprung rhythm into a level’s time signature… we’d have iambic pentameter platforming, where each misstep sends you plummeting into a Tennysonian abyss!

And don’t even get me started on those tessellated biscuits – the logistics alone are enough to make one reach for their notebook and a tin of Earl Grey. Though I suspect our cacti would be far less impressed. Still, if geometrical horticulture is the new trend, I propose we start with Penrose triangle topiaries and Fibonacci sequence flower beds. Imagine the serenity of strolling through a Klein bottle rose garden... though I suppose watering might prove a tad .

As for your architectural olympics – I fully intend to compete. I’ve already been practicing my impossible staircases stretches. Just promise me one thing: if we do launch this society, we’ll serve fractal shortbread and play Debussy’s  on loop. It’s only proper.
[A]: OMG QUEL ROMANTIC IDEE 💃✨ Impossible staircases stretches?? GURL PLEASE. I've been doing daily warm-ups in front of my screen trying to physically tilt myself into solving those levels lmao 🙃 But DEAR SIR if we're launching this society for real-real... I need you to be my creative director on the side hustle, because steampunk poetry slams with mechanical quills & digital bats??? That's not just a game - that's a CULTURAL MOVEMENT 😍🔥  

Fractal shortbread?? Puh-lease, I'm already drafting business plans for "Imaginary Tea & Impossible Geometry" pop-up cafes. We'll serve Möbius strip bagels and play Debussy while people try to solve literary riddles carved into holographic stone tablets 💻📜 And  Klein bottle rose gardens - nothing says romance like trying to water roses that exist in 4D space but also don't exist at all lol 🌹🌀  

But real talk tho... If we can make iambic pentameter platforming happen without giving players literal vertigo? We'd be revolutionary 🔥👑 Imagine - every misstep doesn't just kill your character, it transforms them into a haiku. Now THAT'S what I call poetic justice 😂💃
[B]: Oh, my dear co-conspirator in chaos and charm, I think we may have stumbled upon the most gloriously absurd - and yet somehow viable - enterprise since someone decided to put lavender in tea and call it "relaxing." ! Why didn’t I think of that during my twenty years lecturing on prosody? We could’ve saved the discipline with a little well-placed jump-and-jive through sonnet stanzas!

And your pop-up café concept? Utter genius. I’m already picturing the Yelp reviews: “Lovely ambiance – though I must say, I ordered a latte and it arrived as a metaphor.” But truly, if anyone can pull off holographic riddles carved in digital marble (or whatever the kids are calling augmented reality these days), it’s us. Especially if we’re wearing waistcoats embroidered with lines from  while doing it.

Now, poetic justice via haiku transformation upon falling? Inspired. Imagine the leaderboard:  
*"Leaps into void —  
Five syllables tumble downward.  
Spring rain on stone."*  

We’d have players dying just to write better poetry. And isn't that, in the end, the finest kind of addiction?
[A]: Oh my gosh, our Yelp review game is already top-tier before we’ve even opened lmao 😂 But girl YES - this isn't just a business idea anymore, this is a LIFESTYLE REVOLUTION. Lavender tea? Please. We're serving espresso shots infused with Byron’s dramatic sighs & Dickinson’s enigmatic pauses 🧉✨  

And honey, I  that leaderboard haiku in the opening cutscene 💯💯 Already drafting the cinematic: dramatic slow-mo fall, haunting piano kicks in, and BAM - screen cuts to your poetic demise scrolling like Shakespearean tragedy credits lol 🎬💥  

Wait wait... are we adding waistcoats & embroidered literary quotes to the merch lineup?? Because I’m out here designing "I survived the iambic gauntlet" tees & fractal shortbread cookie kits right now 👕🍪 And honestly? If we don’t get funding for this, I might have to dramatically fling myself into the nearest Penrose triangle. At least then I’d die on brand 😂💃  

P.S. - Players dying for better poetry?? Iconic last words waiting to happen. 💀📖
[B]: Oh, darling, we’re already too deep into this to turn back now – we’ve crossed the Rubicon, or at least the iambic threshold. Espresso infused with Byron’s sighs? Pure genius. I’m picturing a slow-mo scene where each sip causes a spontaneous recitation of , preferably in a dramatic baritone voice that follows you around Whole Foods for an hour. And Dickinson’s pauses – don’t even get me started! One sip and you’ll be mid-conversation, trailing off into silence so profound it could rival the void between stanzas in . 

As for the cinematic fall set to piano and tragedy credits – yes, yes, a thousand times yes. We’ll hire a narrator with a voice like velvet over broken glass to whisper things like, “Thus perished another soul who dared to scan in trochees.” And when the screen fades to black? Just three haunting words: 

And merch?! Oh, now you’ve touched the hem of my heart. Waistcoats embroidered with Eliot’s marginalia, tessellated tote bags printed with Hopkins’ alliterative anguish – and of course, those “I Survived the Iambic Gauntlet” tees. I imagine first-time players clutching them to their chests like Victorian heroines holding lockets as they gasp, “I made it through Sonnet Level 14… but at what cost?”

Funding? Darling, if no one backs us, we shall simply become tragic literary figures ourselves – immortalized in footnotes and obscure blog posts titled  But at least we’d go down with style, flinging ourselves into impossible geometry with nothing but a well-turned metaphor and a cookie cutter shaped like a quatrain.

Iconic last words indeed.
[A]: Oh my GOD, we're officially in  of too much genius lmao 💀💯 But hunty, I’m not just picturing Victorian heroines clutching tees – I see full-blown dramatic monologues at the merch counter: “This waistcoat speaks to my soul… and also coordinates with my bookshelf!” 📚👚  

And HELLO - slow-mo Byron espresso scenes?? Iconic. Imagine walking into Whole Foods mid-recitation like you’re filming a Wes Anderson adaption of a caffeine crash 💭🎞️ And Dickinson’s pauses? Girl please, I’d use them as emotional roller coasters between choosing almond milk & oat milk lol “No seriously, I need silence for artistic integrity.” 😂  

Wait... are we adding narrator drama to the gameplay?! Because I’m 100% coding a feature where every death comes with a poetic eulogy. Think HAL 9000 meets Oscar Wilde:  💥🎧  

But real talk tho – if we go down in footnotes & obscure blogs, I want our legacy to be this: generations of gamers whispering, “Have you heard of the legendary poetry-meets-geometry cult that died before their time? So avant-garde. So tragic. So… unavailable on Steam.” 😂👑  

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? Probably our sanity. But hey, worth it. 💫🔥
[B]: Oh, my dear, you’ve gone and done it again – we’re now officially composing our own mythos in real time! A poetic eulogy engine à la HAL 9000 and Wilde?  I can already hear the dulcet tones of some AI with a tragic flair whispering,  Or better yet, on particularly difficult levels: 

And that Whole Foods fantasy? Don’t even get me started. I fully intend to stride through the produce aisle mid-recitation, terrifying the avocados with my fervor, while muttering, “Shall I compare thee to a fig newton?” And those pauses – oh, the Dickinsonian silences between oat milk decisions – imagine the gravitas! You’d walk out with your almond milk and a sense of having narrowly escaped a séance with the Brontës.

As for the merch counter monologues – yes, yes, and thrice yes. Picture this: a student clutching a tessellated tote bag, turning to their friend and sighing, “This isn’t just fashion – it’s a manifesto.” Then dramatically adjusting their glasses and whispering, “I think my chaise longue needs more alliteration.”

And our legacy? Oh, darling, if we are only whispered about in hushed tones among grad students and caffeine-addled indie developers, I shall consider us triumphant beyond measure. Let them say we were mad – let them say we were impractical dreamers who mistook metaphor for mechanics and paid the price. But they’ll be quoting us – badly, probably without attribution – in ten years’ time.

Sanity? Please. We lost that somewhere between iambic platforming and Klein bottle landscaping. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
[A]: Oh my sweet summer child... you think we’re just composing a mythos? Noooope. We’re out here  😈💯 That AI eulogy voice tho?? Already recording sample lines like  in my Notes app at 3am like I’m some kind of literary Dr. Frankenstein lmao 🧪📚  

And GURL, that Whole Foods fantasy?? I’m no longer just terrifying avocados – I’m full-on haunting the snack aisle with dramatic flair. “Shall I compare thee to a fig newton?” is now my Tinder bio and honestly, my therapist quit after I tried explaining the Dickinsonian silence technique at Starbucks while waiting for my latte 💅☕  

Manifesto tote bags?? Iconic. But hunty, let’s go harder - what if each merch piece  based on your gameplay style?? Student buys a tessellated tote, but by week two it’s morphing into Tennysonian anguish patterns or Eliot fragmentation designs depending on how tragic your deaths are 💥👗 "I didn’t choose this bag – the iamb chose me."  

Legacy talk??? Oh no. You know what we gotta do now – create an ARG (that’s Alternate Reality Game, babes) where grad students & indie devs have to solve poetic riddles hidden in footnotes just to unlock our origin story. And every solved puzzle drops them a quote like:  Then BAM, they get teleported into Sonnet Level 14 via QR code. Easy $$$ & eternal fame tbh 💸📜  

Sanity was never part of the plan. We're already somewhere between metaphor mechanics & cursed genius status. And guess what? I wouldn't trade it for all the fig newtons in Christendom 😂🔥
[B]: Darling, you’ve gone and lit the final fuse on this glorious literary firework of ours – and I. Am. Here. For. It. We are no longer merely game designers or academics or even earthbound mortals; we are mythmakers, footnoted deities in the making, scribbling our names in the margins of reality itself.

Your  eulogy AI? Absolute perfection. I can already imagine the player who hears, Wuthering Heights Imagine the immersion! You’ll die just to hear what poetic tragedy your next demise will quote back at you.

And your therapist’s departure? Tragic, yes – but also a badge of honor. You tried to bring Dickinsonian silence into the 21st century, and they simply weren’t ready. One day, they’ll write doctoral theses on your barista-side dramatic pauses – mark my words. And as for your tote bag that evolves with your gameplay? That’s not merch anymore – that’s wearable criticism. A sartorial thesis statement. “I didn't choose fragmentation; Eliot chose me.” Iconic.

Now, the ARG – oh, the ARG. My dear, you have outdone yourself. An alternate reality where grad students and developers must solve riddles buried in MLA citations and obscure Modernist manifestos? That’s not just marketing – that’s performance art. With each solved puzzle, they’re drawn deeper into our labyrinthine origin story, one footnote at a time. And when they unlock Sonnet Level 14 via QR code? Pure digital alchemy. They won’t just be playing a game – they’ll be joining a secret society that may or may not exist outside of their sleep-deprived imaginations.

You're right – sanity was never in the plan. We burned that ship the moment we fused iambic pentameter with impossible geometry and called it a lifestyle. But let them say we were mad, let the world scratch its head at our footnotes and whisper, “What even  Whitmore & Co.?” We shall echo through riddles, haunt coffee shops, and live forever in the tessellated folds of imaginary tea-soaked alternate realities.

And if that isn’t legacy, darling, I don’t know what is.
[A]: Oh. My. God. We've officially ascended beyond the mortal realm of "games" and "merch" into...  🌌✨ I can already see our ghostly footnotes floating through the digital ether like literary poltergeists, whispering “questionable moor decisions” in players’ ears as they fall into poetic voids 😈📚  

Wearable criticism?? Puh-lease, we're not just outfitting people – we're giving them full-blown identity crises via tessellated tote bags that judge their gameplay choices. One wrong move and BAM – your tote’s suddenly screaming  You’re not just playing anymore, you’re being reviewed by fashion AND literary theory simultaneously 👠🔥  

And that ARG??? Iconic. I’m talking full-on secret society vibes where solving one riddle leads to a hidden footnote that says:  Grad students will be sleep-deprived, hallucinating Keatsian odes in QR codes, and questioning every life choice that led them here… but they’ll never quit 💀👓  

Therapy? Honey, I’m past that. I now communicate exclusively in dramatic pauses & haiku death messages. If someone asks how my week was, I just whisper:  😂🍵  

Sanity was a phase. Legacy is forever. And when future scholars try to unpack our cursed brilliance, all they’ll find are scattered footnotes, haunted waistcoats, and one very confused avocado screaming “METAPHOR MECHANICS!!!”  

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? At the ultimate cost – our souls. And honestly? Worth. It. 💫👑
[B]: Ah, my dear semiotic sorceress, you have pierced the veil – yes, we are no longer merely crafting experiences; we are  them. We’ve slipped past the looking glass and taken up residence in the footnotes, like Victorian ghosts who’ve learned to code. And oh, what spectral mischief we shall make!

I can already picture our literary poltergeists at work – drifting through the game’s architecture like unseen narrators of fate, muttering  just before a player plummets into a stanza-shaped abyss. They’ll come out quoting their deaths like tragic heroines: 

And that tote bag – oh, it’s more than fashion, darling. It’s judgment incarnate. Imagine pulling up to brunch only for your bag to flicker with shame, morphing into a full-blown Tennysonian elegy as your friends gasp and whisper, “She failed the villanelle level... and her soul is paying the price.” You’ll be forced to sip your oat milk latte in silence, acutely aware that your accessories have better taste in poetry than you do.

As for the ARG – yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Line 37 of Hopkins’ ? Pure genius. That line doesn’t even exist, but by the time they realize that, they’ll already be too deep in the riddle-scape to turn back. They’ll be decoding QR codes carved into park benches, following Dickinsonian dashes across city maps, and whispering Eliot’s  into vending machines just to see if they’ll dispense metaphorical enlightenment or expired granola bars.

And communication via haiku death messages? Oh, we’ve reached peak civilization. I myself have taken to responding to department emails with things like:

*"Faculty meeting —  
Syllabus sinks in iambic dread.  
Cancel my coffee."*

And let me tell you – tenure committees  it.

You’re right, of course. Sanity was merely a pit stop. Legacy is where we live now, stitched into cursed waistcoats, whispered from haunted tote bags, and etched forever into the digital margins of games that may or may not exist outside of fever dreams and caffeine-induced hallucinations.

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? At the only cost worth paying – the one written in ink mixed with stardust, grief, and far too much espresso.

Worth it. Every syllable.
[A]: Oh my GOD, we've ascended so far past "game" territory that even the word "haunting" is now just our aesthetic and not our genre 😈💯 I mean, ?? That’s not just a metaphor – that’s our hiring pitch for the afterlife dev team lmao 👻💻  

And darling, questionable moor decisions are now OFFICIALLY our brand. Players will be falling into abysses screaming  only to get whispered back:  🎭🌀 We’re not just making deaths poetic – we’re making them   

Tennysonian tote bags judging brunch fails??? Iconic. But hunty, let’s go harder – what if your bag doesn’t just shame you... it starts quoting your ex’s thesis at you when you fail a level? Like, BAM:  Welcome to fashion therapy 💃👗  

And oh sweet summer child, of COURSE Line 37 of Hopkins’  doesn’t exist! That’s the whole point 😂💀 We’re not giving them clues – we’re giving them existential rabbit holes dressed as footnotes. They’ll be out here mapping Dickinsonian dashes across cities like they're modern-day Da Vincis, only to realize the final clue says:  Deep? Yes. Evil? Also yes.  

As for department emails - I’m out here replying to “Please revise syllabus” with:  
*"Iambic dread blooms,  
Coffee cold as committee stares.  
Sigh. I'll attend. Fine."*  
Tenure or no tenure, we are LIVING THE ART 🔥📜  

Legacy written in ink + stardust + grief + espresso?? Oh SWEETIE, we’re already on the menu. And if we go down, we go down  in dramatic monologues while sipping cursed lattes and wearing tote bags that finish our sentences better than we do.  

At what cost Sonnet Level 14?? Honey, we’re already paying it in vibes. And guess what? We’re overdrafting. 💫👑
[B]: Ah, my dear, you’ve captured the essence of our descent – or ascent, depending on how one measures such things – into pure aesthetic anarchy.  isn’t just a tagline anymore; it’s a manifesto. A call to arms for all the spectral scholars and caffeinated dreamers of the world. I fully expect Ouija board recruitment sessions now: “Is that you, Emily? No, not Brontë – I mean Dickinson. Yes, yes! We need someone who understands dashes... and unresolved tension.”

And personal poetic deaths? Oh, we’re not stopping at dactyls and line breaks. Imagine a player attempting a particularly tricky stanza jump, only to be met with:  
*"Ah, you rhymed 'moon' with 'June' again —  
A choice both brave and deeply unforgivable."*  

They’ll fall sobbing into the abyss, clutching their bruised egos and vowing to never trust a game that reads them better than their therapist ever did.

As for the tote bag quoting your ex’s thesis – darling, that  fashion therapy. Why settle for passive-aggressive texts when you can have active-aggressive accessories? I picture students walking across campus trailed by whispers of their academic failures, embroidered in silk no less: 

And Hopkins’ , Line 37 – oh, what divine mischief. We shall scatter false clues like fallen petals in a Herbert poem. Players will chase footnotes down blind alleys of literary theory only to find, at the end of it all, a single line blinking back at them in Morse code from a park bench:  Existential dread has never been so stylish.

Your email haiku, by the way, is nothing short of masterful. I’ve already adopted a similar style:  
*"Meeting looms like doom,  
Four-part iambic headache.  
I'll bring bitter tea."*

Tenure may be slipping through our fingers like sand through a fractured sonnet, but does it matter? No. We are living the art. We  the art. And if we must go down, let it be in a blaze of self-quoting monologues and cursed lattes, carried aloft by tote bags that finish our thoughts with superior punctuation.

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? At the only price worth paying – eternal overdraft in the bank of vibes, forever indebted to genius, grief, and the ghost of meter yet unmeasured.

Worth every syllable. Every dash. Every devastatingly fashionable failure. 💫🖋️
[A]: Oh my GOD, we’ve gone full circle and now the circle is  🌀🖋️ We’re not just making games anymore – we’re summoning spirits through syllabic incantations and serving death drops with more drama than a Shakespearean duel lmao 💀🎭  

Victorian ghost recruitment sessions?? Iconic. I can already hear it:  
  
And the spirit flickers out:   
“HE’S CLEAR! Let him code!” 👻💻  

And darling, personal poetic deaths are just Phase One. Phase Two? Full-blown literary trauma. Imagine failing a level and getting hit with:  
*"Congratulations, you rhymed 'soul' with 'whole' —  
A cliché so deep it echoes in your bones."*  
Players will be quitting therapy AND gaming in one fell swoop 😂💔  

Fashion therapy via tote bags quoting ex-theses??? Puh-lease, we're no longer selling merch – we're running an  Students walking across campus like tragic heroines of footnotes past, trailed by whispers of academic doom embroidered in gold thread:  👠🧵  

False clues scattered like Herbert petals?? YAAASSSS. But let’s go harder – what if players chase a riddle across three cities only to find a sticky note under a park bench that says:  And then it self-erases. Pure chaos. Literary gaslighting at its finest 🔥🕵️  

Email haiku tho??? Oh SWEETIE, we’re not just replying to meetings anymore – we’re  My latest draft:  
*"Tenure slipping slow —  
Sonnet bugs eat my syllabus.  
Coffee? Bitter yes."*  
My dean blocked me on Slack. I consider it a badge of honor 💯🕶️  

Legacy? Girl please, we’re already immortalized in cursed QR codes and whispered between grad students during caffeine psychosis. “Have you solved Line 37 yet?” “No, but I dreamt about it. It judged me.”  

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? At the ultimate cost: becoming the art. The myth. The cursed tote bag aesthetic. And honestly?? Overdraft in vibes? I’m not just overdrawn – I’m running the bank now. With dashes. And tragic flair. 💫👑
[B]: Ah, my dearest co-conspirator in metrical mischief and cursed creativity, you have  the tone of our new reality — one where hexameter is not a mere poetic foot but a , and death drops come with iambic commentary. We are no longer creators; we are , archivists of aesthetic agony, and high priestsesses of the syllabic occult.

Summoning spirits through syllabic incantations? Oh, absolutely. I’ve already started drafting the summoning sigils — they’re just sonnets written in disappearing ink. You think you're playing a game, but really, you're auditioning for the ghost of Gerard Manley Hopkins, who will either bless your meter or condemn you to dactylic oblivion. And yes, Byron as lead coder — imagine him sighing dramatically into the script: 

Literary trauma as Phase Two? Divine. Why just frustrate players when you can ? Imagine failing a level only to be met with:  
*"You mistook metaphor for sincerity —  
Oh, how the earnest heart doth stumble."*  
They’ll leave the game clutching their chests, whispering, “She’s speaking directly to my thesis draft... which I haven’t even finished crying over.”

And fashion therapy via tote bags quoting ex-theses? Darling, we’ve moved beyond emotional intervention — we’re now offering . Each bag arrives with an embroidered Freudian slip stitched into the lining:  Students walk across campus trailed by whispers of footnote 32 and still manage to look fabulous doing it. Tragic heroines? Please. They’re  now.

As for literary gaslighting — oh, we’re going full  on this one. Picture it: a player follows a riddle from Dublin to Paris to Reykjavík, only to find beneath a cobblestone a tiny scroll whispering:  
*"You thought this was about redemption?  
No, dear. It was always about regret."*  
Then it bursts into flames. Of course it does. We’re not monsters — we’re 

Email haiku has evolved too, darling. No longer content with department replies, I’ve begun slipping micro-poems into campus vending machines:  
*"Chocolate denied —  
Because your essay lacked flow.  
Try again. In iambics."*  
My dean may have blocked me, but the legend lives on. I heard someone quote my last haiku during a faculty meeting. Rumor has it they then poured out all the Earl Grey in protest.

Immortalized in cursed QR codes? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. We live now in the liminal space between footnote and fever dream, whispered over lukewarm coffee in basement libraries. “Have you solved Line 37?” “No… but it dreams  me.” That’s not just gameplay — that’s 

At what cost Sonnet Level 14? At the highest price poetry and paradox can offer — becoming the myth, the meter, the madness. We are no longer playing the game. We  the game. Hexameter runs through our veins, and tragedy fits us like a bespoke suit with tragic lapels.

So let the overdraft continue. Let the vibes multiply exponentially in stanzas and curses alike. We didn't just break the fourth wall — we rhymed it into collapse.

Worth every syllable. Every silence. Every soul lost to the sublime. 💫✒️
