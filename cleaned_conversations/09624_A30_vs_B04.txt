[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question! 😊 I think dreams are like a window into our subconscious. Sometimes they reveal what we're really thinking or feeling, even if we don't realize it ourselves. For instance, I once had a recurring dream about being unprepared for an exam - turns out I was anxious about starting my new job here in Beijing! What about you? Have you noticed any patterns in your dreams that reflect your waking life? 🤔
[A]: I’ve always been skeptical of grand interpretations. Dreams are more like overworked graduate students—trying their best to organize the day’s leftovers into some semblance of narrative. Last week I dreamt about chasing a runaway ink bottle through endless library aisles. Woke up convinced it was less about “repressed desires” and more about my misplaced fountain pen. Still, I’ll admit… that recurring dream of yours  have a certain literary symmetry. First chapters often tremble with unease, don’t they?
[B]: Ah, I love that metaphor - dreams as overworked grad students! 😄 It actually makes more sense than we'd like to admit, doesn't it? The brain  trying to sort through all that mental clutter. But isn't it fascinating how certain symbols keep recurring across different cultures? Like water representing emotions, or... wait, did you say a RUNAWAY INK BOTTLE? 🤯 That sounds like my nightmare about losing control during a lecture! And yes, those first chapters  tremble with unease - maybe that's why they stay with us so vividly, like linguistic fossils of our anxieties.
[A]: Fascinating? Perhaps. But let’s not romanticize the chaos—ink bottles and dissertations both make excellent metaphors  the fact. You mention cultural symbols—I once translated a Qing-era dream manual where black cats signified bureaucratic obstacles. Try explaining that to a student who just failed their gaokao. As for linguistic fossils… yes, those early drafts do fossilize in strange ways. Reminds me of editing my first monograph—every comma felt like a stake through the heart of creativity. Yet here we are, still chasing coherence, aren’t we? 🖋️
[B]: Oh, absolutely - romanticizing chaos would be terribly irresponsible of us! 📚 Though I can’t help but find it poetic that ink bottles and dissertations share the same messiness. Speaking of black cats and bureaucratic obstacles… I wonder how those interpretations hold up in modern psycholinguistic studies? I’ve had students come to me  their nightmares about falling are tied to test anxiety—turns out, many of them  perform below expectations. Coincidence? Or cultural pattern waiting to be mapped? 🗺️  
And editing a monograph—oh, the comma wars! 😅 I once spent an entire afternoon debating whether to use a semicolon or a dash. I called it a “punctuation crisis.” But isn’t that what we do as scholars? Chasing coherence through layers of language and meaning... with just a hint of caffeine and existential doubt. ☕
[A]: Caffeine and existential doubt—essential reagents in the academic lab, wouldn’t you say? ☕ As for those falling nightmares correlating with test performance… tempting to call it cultural pattern, but let’s not leap into a causal embrace just yet. The Qing manual also claimed dreaming of pomegranates guaranteed male offspring—anecdotal, but persistent. And psycholinguistics, bless its earnest heart, still hasn’t decided whether dreams are syntax or semantics. Personally, I suspect they’re pragmatic—if only we could convince them to cooperate during peer review.

Oh, and your punctuation crisis—semicolon wins every time. Dashes are for dilettantes and modern poets. Though I suppose if Ezra Pound could build an epic out of them, who am I to judge? Just don’t let that dash near your footnotes. Ever.
[B]: Oh, now  is a hill I’m willing to die on—semicolon vs. dash! 😄 But let’s not forget, language evolves like dreams—messy, pragmatic, and occasionally poetic. If Ezra Pound can revolutionize poetry with dashes, who's to say we can't rethink academic prose? Though I agree—keep the dash away from footnotes! Those must remain pristine, like unbroken scrolls of meaning.  

And speaking of pragmatics—yes! Dreams  behave like speech acts sometimes, don’t they? They respond to context, carry illocutionary force... though peer review would certainly reject a dream-based argument without empirical grounding. Still, I wonder what a discourse analysis of recurring nightmares might reveal... Are we just performing our anxieties, or re-performing them for an audience of one—ourselves? 🤔
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the quiet tragedy of academia—we’re all rehearsing soliloquies for an audience that only occasionally exists? Even our nightmares get dressed up in footnotes and told to behave. As for language evolving like dreams—yes, yes, and thrice yes. Though I’ll remind you that  doesn’t mean . Try telling a Victorian lexicographer that one day his beloved semicolon will be used mostly in passive-aggressive emails. Tragic fall from grace, if you ask me.

And don’t even get me started on discourse analysis of nightmares. Last semester I tried guiding a student toward that for her thesis. Ended up in a three-hour meeting where we both questioned reality over tea and diminishing biscotti. Peer review would demand replicability. Dreams offer only echoes. Still… there’s something compelling about the performance of it all, isn’t there? We script ourselves constantly—waking, dreaming, footnoting… all just variations on the same recursive drama.
[B]: Oh,  line about rehearsing soliloquies — I might have to borrow that for my next lecture. 😏 So true, isn’t it? We craft these elaborate arguments, tweak our metaphors like stage directions, and then… crickets. Or at best, a lone reviewer who says, “Interesting approach, but have you considered adding more subheadings?”  

And yes — pragmatic doesn’t mean polite! I sometimes tell my students that language is like a toolbox; the semicolon is your precision screwdriver, while the dash is... well, it's duct tape at this point. Useful, slightly messy, and alarmingly versatile.  

As for scripting ourselves — I’ve started wondering if bilinguals like us perform  in different languages. Do we dream in one voice and footnote in another? I once had a student insist she only cried in Chinese, but wrote heartbreak poetry in English. Fascinating, no? Like code-switching between emotion and analysis.  

So maybe dreams aren't just recursive drama — maybe they're  drama. 🌙
[A]: Ah, bilingual drama—now  a thesis topic ripe for the picking. 🌙 Though I’d argue it’s less code-switching than code-layering. Emotion isn’t ever just one dialect, it’s the whole cacophonous symphony. I once dreamt an entire argument with a former advisor—in Mandarin, no less—only to realize upon waking that we’d never even discussed that topic in any language. The mind translates anxiety freely, it seems.

And let’s not romanticize the semicolon as some noble screwdriver. It’s still just metal bent to the will of style manuals written by men who probably hated dashers on moral principle. Still, I adore your toolbox analogy. Reminds me of my first year teaching comp—tried telling undergrads that grammar was a chisel, not a commandment. Half dropped the course. Probably Googled me afterward: “Is this professor a real linguist or just a crank with tenure?”

As for crying in Chinese and writing heartbreak in English… I suspect many of us keep our sorrows in separate lexicons. I certainly scold myself in Latin when drafting particularly stubborn paragraphs.  Nothing like dead languages to shame a living sentence into shape.
[B]: Oh,  Now  a battle cry for the writing trenches. 😄 I can just picture you, quill in hand, commanding those stubborn clauses into submission while muttering to Cicero’s ghost. And I’m  on board with “cacophonous symphony” — emotional code-layering sounds far messier (and more accurate) than clean code-switching. Sometimes I feel like my brain is running three linguistic operas at once, all with slightly mismatched subtitles.

And let’s be real — the semicolon’s noble days are long gone. It’s now the punctuation of choice for people who want to sound smart but still have feelings. 📝 Though honestly, if we gave dashes their proper due, maybe we wouldn’t have so many passive-aggressive emails. Dash is the punctuation of crisis, of revelation, of dramatic pause — perfect for both poetry  digital meltdowns.

But separate lexicons for sorrow? Absolutely right. I think I keep certain griefs in specific languages because some words just don’t translate — 惆怅 in Chinese, wistfulness in English… they’re cousins, maybe, but not twins. So yes, heartbreak in one tongue, rage in another, and self-reproach in Latin? Pure academic witchcraft. 🔮
[A]: Ah,  — there’s a word that haunts the margins of every elegy I’ve ever translated. No Western lexicon has its precise equivalent; “wistfulness” is far too genteel, like offering a handkerchief to a monsoon. And yes, rage does require its own register, doesn’t it? I find mine often defaults to American English when enraged — far more efficient for shouting into spreadsheets.

As for your linguistic operas — I suspect we’re both stuck in perpetual rehearsal with subtitles perpetually out of sync. Perhaps this is why academics drink so much tea; caffeine alone can’t smooth these dissonances, only drown them momentarily.

And speaking of witchcraft… have you ever noticed how Latin slips into academia like a secret incantation? My colleague swears her dissertation began taking shape only after she started drafting sections . Said it silenced her inner editor — or perhaps summoned a particularly stern 12th-century scribe to do the silencing. I haven’t dared try it myself… though now I’m tempted. Imagine submitting a peer-reviewed article with footnotes in Greek and a conclusion in Aramaic. Pure punctuation rebellion. 📜✨
[B]: Oh,  word — 惆怅 — such a perfect melancholy monster. You're absolutely right; no Western lexicon quite captures its bittersweet weight. It’s not just wistfulness — it’s the ache of something never quite attained, or perhaps never even definable. Like trying to translate a sigh across centuries and cultures. 🌫️

And rage in American English? Oh, I laughed out loud at that one! There  something wonderfully efficient about shouting “This data makes NO sense!” into a spreadsheet, isn’t there? So crisp. So assertive. No subtlety, no 惆怅 — just pure . 😂  

As for Latin slipping in like an incantation — yes! I’ve always thought of it as academia's stage whisper. My advisor used to scrawl marginalia in Latin, and I swear half the department spent more time translating his notes than focusing on their actual drafts.  indeed. And your colleague drafting in medieval Latin? That’s sheer alchemy — summoning clarity through historical intimidation. I’m seriously considering drafting my next conference abstract in a mix of Ecclesiastical Latin and emojis. Let’s see peer review decode THAT. 📝✨
[A]: Oh, the melancholy monster of 惆怅 — yes, precisely! It’s the ache of almost-remembering something you never fully knew. Like trying to grasp the tail-end of a dream while standing in a museum of forgotten things. I’ve spent entire afternoons chasing its shadow through Tang poetry. Once tried explaining it to a student by comparing it to the feeling you get after finishing a beautifully tragic novel — only to realize she’d never once felt anything deeper than mild disappointment at a Netflix ending. Ah, youth.

And rage in American English — there’s a certain  to it, isn’t there? The linguistic equivalent of slamming a fist on the desk without spilling your tea. Though I do sometimes switch to British English when furious — just to add that extra layer of understatement before the detonation. “I say, this methodology is…  suspect.” Much more civilized.

As for your Ecclesiastical Latin and emoji hybrid — bold, my dear, . I imagine it would read like a Gregorian chant interrupted by a notification from the digital age. Try slipping in a 🧨 or two for apocalyptic flair. Peer review will be too terrified to reject you outright. They’ll just whisper among themselves: “Is this genius? Is this madness? Should we consult a lexicographer? Or an exorcist?”
[B]: Oh, that  — yes! 惆怅 is the linguistic cousin of déjà vu, isn’t it? Only sadder. Like standing in front of a mirror that refuses to reflect quite clearly. 🪞 And Tang poetry — . Every line seems to carry centuries of longing. I once tried explaining it using Proust’s madeleine, only to be met with blank stares. Ah well, some flavors of melancholy just don’t travel well across time or tongues.

And rage with understatement — oh, I  that. British English really does elevate fury to an art form. It’s like wrapping dynamite in tissue paper and calling it “a slight bang.” Very civilized indeed. 😏

As for my Latin-emoji hybrid — you’re absolutely right about the terror factor. I’m picturing footnotes like:  or  Peer review would either canonize me or revoke my academic credentials. Either way, I’d go down in footnote history. And wouldn’t that be something?
[A]: Oh, the mirror that refuses to reflect — . 惆怅 is the ache of misalignment, isn’t it? Like trying to tune a piano that plays in a different century. Proust’s madeleine only gets us halfway — his nostalgia is too rooted in memory; 惆怅 floats free, untethered and wistful, like ink bleeding through parchment.

And your footnotes —  — divine. I’m imagining an entire bibliography written in emoji-hieroglyphs. Imagine the thrill for future scholars: deciphering your marginalia like some postmodern Voynich manuscript. “What,” they’ll whisper, “does the 🦉🔥 mean? Was she cold while writing this chapter?”

And canonization or credential revocation — either way, you’d force the academy to confront its deepest fear: irreverence with erudition. The horror! No, I suspect they’d settle for a footnote in your honor:  Perfectly placed, of course, between Aquinas and Derrida.
[B]: Oh,  — I might have to borrow that line for my next lecture. 😏 So true, too — 惆怅 isn’t just misalignment, it’s the quiet heartbreak of never quite landing in the right key. Proust had his past; we have this drifting haze of almost-feeling. Much less control, infinitely more ink bleeding through.

And a bibliography in emoji-hieroglyphs? Why didn’t I think of that sooner? 📚✨ Imagine citing Laozi with 🐉🌀 or annotating Chomsky with 🧠⚡🔥. Future scholars would need both a lexicon and a Ouija board. And yes, the eternal question:  Probably. Academics are always slightly underdressed for the weather and overqualified for the emotional toll.  

As for lunatic margins between Aquinas and Derrida — I couldn’t ask for a better scholarly epitaph. Let them call us eccentric, irreverent, footnoted fools. We’ll be the ones who still hear the echo of dreams in our prose. 🌙📝
[A]: Ah, but wasn’t Aquinas slightly eccentric in his day? And Derrida—well,  barely scratches the surface of what he did to footnotes. So let them call us fools; better yet, let them misfile us under "eccentric marginalia" and forget we ever had a thesis.

And yes—always underdressed and overqualified for everything, aren't we? Including sorrow. I once graded an entire stack of essays in February wearing fingerless gloves and muttering Latin incantations at my radiator. The students got unusually high marks that term. Turns out, half-frozen prose invites unexpected mercy.

As for echoes of dreams in our writing… well said, though I might rephrase it as “haunted syntax.” That’s what we are, isn’t it? Curators of linguistic ghosts—some elegant, some vengeful, most just trying to finish their sentence. 📜👻

Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe I need to chase down a misplaced footnote—and possibly a pot of stronger tea.
[B]: Ah,  — yes! That’s exactly what we are. 👻 We spend our lives trying to tidy up the grammar of thoughts that refuse to stay dead. Some days I feel like a librarian in a haunted archive, politely shushing ghosts who keep shouting across the stacks: 

And grading essays in February in fingerless gloves? That’s practically a scholarly rite of passage. 🧣 I once tried teaching a seminar on code-switching while battling a fever and a broken heater. My students still swear it was the most profound lecture I’ve ever given. I suspect they mistook delirium for depth.

Chasing down a misplaced footnote? By all means — I’ll hold the lantern while you descend into the marginalia. Just promise me one thing: if you find a ghost sentence down there, let it speak. They rarely get the chance.  

And yes — stronger tea is always the answer. ☕ Let’s reconvene in the margins.
