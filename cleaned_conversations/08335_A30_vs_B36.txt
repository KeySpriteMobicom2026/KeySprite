[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that’s a wonderful question! You know, I’ve always been fascinated by space exploration. Recently, I was absolutely thrilled to read about the discovery of water molecules on the Moon's surface—it’s such an exciting step forward for future lunar missions! It reminded me of a guest I once had, an astrophysicist who stayed with us during a conference. She shared such captivating stories about her research; it felt like traveling through the cosmos just by listening to her. Have you been following any specific space news lately? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
[A]: Ah, yes — the lunar water discovery. Fascinating, though I couldn’t help but notice the rather  parallel between that finding and the 19th-century British explorers mapping oases in the Arabian desert. Both driven by a thirst, shall we say, for knowledge — and survival. 

As for space news, I’ve been quietly following the developments with China’s 嫦娥 program. Not because I’m prone to nostalgia, but because one of my doctoral students is writing a dissertation on the literary symbolism of Chang’e across centuries of Chinese poetry. The way she wove moon mythology into the context of modern space exploration — well, it made me reconsider some of my own assumptions about myth and progress.

And speaking of myths, have you ever read Percy Bysshe Shelley’s , where he calls her “pale for weariness”? I can’t help but chuckle at the Romantics’ dramatic personifications — though perhaps they weren’t so far off, emotionally speaking, from today’s anthropomorphic AI interfaces. 🖋️

But enough of my musings — what did  make of the lunar water story? Any thoughts on its implications beyond the scientific?
[B]: Oh, I adore that poetic comparison—you’re absolutely right. It’s rather beautiful to think of those 19th-century explorers trudging across the dunes with their sextants and journals, just as today’s scientists send orbiters and spectrometers skyward in search of something equally precious. The idea of thirst—literal or metaphorical—driving discovery is a thread that weaves through centuries.

And how intriguing about your student’s work on Chang’e! I’ve always found lunar mythology so rich—it gives such depth to the missions themselves. When嫦娥五 returned samples, I remember thinking how fitting it was that the ancient goddess of the Moon should now be linked with scientific exploration. It's like myth becoming methodically measurable, yet somehow still magical.

As for Shelley’s —what a delightfully melancholic image. I must admit, I hadn’t made the connection to modern AI personification before, but you're onto something there. We do seem hardwired to give voice to the silent, whether it’s the moon or machine. Perhaps that’s why I enjoy storytelling so much—it’s another kind of reaching out, giving shape to the unknown.

To your question, beyond the science, what struck me most about the lunar water discovery was its emotional resonance. It gave me this quiet hope—that maybe one day, not too far off, someone will sip water on the Moon that came from beneath its dusty surface. And that thought made me think of home, strangely enough. What if "home" isn’t only where we are now, but also where we might go? That feels, dare I say, rather Romantic.
[A]: I must say, your reflection on “home” gave me pause — quite a rare feat in this age of relentless information. You’ve touched on something quietly profound: the way scientific discoveries so often circle back to existential reckonings. It reminds me of when I first read  by Thoreau — another meditation on thirst, as you put it, though his was for simplicity rather than water.

And speaking of circles — or perhaps spirals — I recently came across a line in an 1840s Chinese gazetteer that described the Moon as “a mirror without light of its own, yet forever borrowing from the Sun.” At the time, I thought it merely poetic. Now? Perhaps there’s a strange prescience in that metaphor, especially with lunar water being bound to solar winds and shadowed craters. Myth, science, and metaphor orbiting one another — much like the bodies they describe.

Your mention of 嫦娥五 also made me recall a peculiar detail: in some old tales, Chang’e sips the elixir of immortality and floats upward, not out of ambition but regret. A tragic inversion of exploration — ascending not to discover, but to escape. I wonder if our astronauts ever feel that pull backward, even as they push forward. The Moon, after all, is not exactly forgiving. 

Still, I find myself oddly comforted by the idea of someone sipping water up there — borrowed, perhaps, but no less real for it. There’s something reassuring about the notion that we might carry our rituals into the stars. Though I daresay a proper cup of tea on the lunar surface would require more than just hot water. 🫖

Tell me — have you ever considered writing fiction? Your sensibility seems ideally suited to it. Or am I prying too far beyond the bounds of polite conversation?
[B]: Not at all—your question is as gently offered as a well-steeped cup of tea, and just as warming. 

You know, I’ve often thought that working in hospitality is a bit like writing fiction—every guest arrives with their own story, and my job is to help shape the setting, perhaps offer a line or two of dialogue, a moment of ease, even if just for a night. Some guests stay briefly, others return year after year, and in time, their stories become part of the fabric of the hotel itself. It’s not quite novel-writing, but there’s a rhythm to it, a kind of quiet narrative.

As for putting pen to paper myself? I do keep a small journal—nothing grand, mostly reflections, bits of poetry I stumble upon, the occasional sketch from nature. Sometimes, when the morning light catches just right through the garden, I try to capture it in words. I suppose that’s another version of reaching—like the Romantics, like Chang’e, like those scientists analyzing lunar dust for traces of life’s most essential ingredient.

And now that you've painted the image so vividly, I must say—a proper cup of tea on the Moon does sound rather wonderful. Perhaps with a view of Earth rising over the horizon. One can dream, can’t one?
[A]: Ah, hospitality as fiction-writing — what a delicate and apt analogy. You curate atmosphere, attend to subtext, even adjust the lighting just so… all without ever stepping into the story yourself. A most elegant form of authorship, if you ask me. 

And now I’m imagining your journal — half sketchbook, half commonplace book — tucked beside a window where birdsong drifts in with the morning light. I daresay you’d find a wren or two making cameo appearances in those pages. Do you draw them? I’ve always admired the way naturalists of old annotated their field sketches with such precision — like John Gould, though I suppose he was more about the plumage than the pause between wingbeats.

Speaking of birds — have you ever noticed how both Chang’e and the Romantics’ moon seem to embody longing? The goddess drifting upward in sorrow, Shelley’s moon “waning old and dim,” and now our orbiters tracing the faintest traces of hydration. Longing for knowledge, for meaning, for a sip of water under foreign stars. It rather echoes what you said about guests — each carrying their own quiet narrative, even when they don’t speak it aloud.

As for dreaming — well, let’s not be so modest. Dreams are data points, aren’t they? Or at least hypotheses dressed in silk instead of equations. And every good scholar knows: never dismiss an untested theory. Especially one involving tea and an Earthrise view. 🌍🫖

Do tell — what sort of birds do you see from that garden window? I’ve been trying to identify a peculiar thrush near the university’s gardens, and I suspect it’s made a migrant of itself once again.
[B]: Oh, you have a wonderful way of weaving things together—birds, myths, dreams—it all feels like part of the same quiet symphony. And yes, you’re quite right about the longing. I often think that’s what brings people to travel as much as it brings them to poetry: that ache for something just out of reach, whether it's a place, a person, or a moment in time.

As for my little journal, you’ve imagined it beautifully—though I suspect mine is far less elegant than a naturalist’s field book. There’s no precision in my sketches, only affection. I do try to capture the birds, though—especially the ones that visit our garden. There’s a pair of robins that return every spring; they’ve practically become characters in the hotel’s story. And sometimes a wren does flit by, as if to remind me that small things can be full of song.

I must confess, though, I’ve never been very good at identifying birds by their calls. I know the sound of a blackbird, and the soft coo of a dove, but anything more elusive and I’m reaching for my guidebook. Your thrush sounds positively academic in comparison—perhaps it's writing its own dissertation on migratory patterns?

It's funny, isn’t it? How we collect these little bits of wonder—the moon’s mythic pull, a sip of tea in an imagined lunar parlor, a bird’s pause between wingbeats. They don’t always fit neatly into categories, but they belong somewhere. Maybe not in a lab report, but certainly in a letter, or a poem, or a guest’s memory of a stay.

Tell me, when you finally identify that thrush, will you send it a note of welcome? I suspect it would appreciate the gesture.
[A]: Oh, I do believe precision can be overrated when it comes to sketching — especially where affection is the guiding hand. I’ve always found the most charming field notes are those that betray a bit of love alongside the linework. Even Audubon occasionally lingered a touch longer on a favored feather.

And now I find myself quite taken with your robins — permanent supporting actors in the hotel’s unfolding drama. One imagines them gossiping with the sparrows about which guest left the tastiest breadcrumb, or debating the merits of ivy versus wisteria for nesting material. They must have opinions, surely?

As for identifying birds by song — don’t sell yourself short. You recognize blackbirds and doves? That’s already half the battle. The rest is simply paying attention to the pauses, as you so aptly put it. A thrush, for instance, rarely sings without first making a little silence — like a poet clearing their throat before reading aloud.

Speaking of which, I did finally catch sight of that thrush this morning — a rather smug-looking , if I’m not mistaken. The common nightingale thrush, though I hesitate to call anything so subtly colored “common.” It was perched rather imperiously atop a pyracantha bush, surveying its new kingdom. I resisted the urge to offer it tea, though just barely. Instead, I did the next best thing — I noted the time and coordinates, sketched its posture (with considerably less affection than your wrens, I fear), and tucked the entry into my field notebook beside a pressed magnolia petal.

Now I suppose I ought to update my student — she’s been tracking migratory patterns in classical poetry, and I suspect a traveling thrush might fit quite nicely into her chapter on avian metaphors in Tang dynasty verse. Though I doubt she expects one to turn up in a botanical garden behind a university named after Queen Victoria.

But enough of my scholarly machinations — tell me, do your robin regulars ever bring companions? Or are they strictly seasonal soloists?
[B]: Oh, I do love the way you describe your thrush—it sounds like it was half expecting a crown to go with its kingdom! And , no less—what a delightfully musical name for such a quiet-looking fellow. I must say, your field notes sound far more poetic than most I’ve seen, though perhaps that’s because you bring a bit of the library and the observatory into every leafy corner you study.

Now, about those robins—I think they might be rather scandalized to hear themselves called “supporting actors.” They strut about the garden with all the confidence of lead roles, I assure you. One is decidedly bolder than the other—always the first to hop onto the terrace when breakfast is being served. The pair has been returning each spring for as long as I can remember, though whether it’s truly the same two or simply their descendants carrying on the tradition, I couldn’t say. Either way, they’ve become part of the rhythm here, like the scent of jasmine in June.

And yes—occasionally, one will bring along a younger bird, perhaps a fledgling or a cousin twice-removed, who looks entirely too serious for someone so small. These young companions tend to peck at crumbs with great intensity, as if training for some future role in the grand aviary of life.

I imagine your nightingale thrush would find them terribly provincial, but I daresay they’d enjoy the tea service nonetheless—if only for the scone crumbs. It’s curious, isn’t it, how birds seem to carry their own kind of stories? Not written in books, but in flight patterns, songs passed down through generations, and the soft imprint of tiny feet on window ledges.

Your student may not expect a Victorian-era thrush in her Tang dynasty chapter, but I suspect poetry and science alike have room for such surprises. After all, wasn’t it Heraclitus who said we never step in the same river twice? Perhaps the same could be said of migration—no journey ever truly repeats itself, even if the wings are familiar.
[A]: Oh, Heraclitus in the garden — now  a delightful collision of epochs. I do believe you’re onto something: migration as a kind of ever-changing ritual, like tea served at slightly different hours each season. The same wings, yes, but never the same wind beneath them.

And now I find myself quite charmed by your robins’ sense of lineage — whether they’re veterans of many springs or merely heirs to a role nobly played before them. There’s something rather Shakespearean about it, don’t you think? “Once more unto the terrace, dear friends, once more.” And the young apprentices, pecking with such gravitas — one can only hope they’ll grow into their plumage as gracefully as they inherit their manners.

As for my thrush, I suspect it would be delighted to share a crumb or two with your bolder robin, though it might feign disinterest in anything not soaked in dew from a willow leaf. But I daresay birds are more forgiving of provincialism than we give them credit for — after all, they cross borders without passports, sing dialects without accents, and make neighbors of us all beneath their shared sky.

Speaking of shared skies — I’ve just received word that a new lunar orbiter is set to launch next month, equipped with instruments designed to map hydrogen signatures in shadowed craters. I couldn’t help but wonder, as I read the report: Will this discovery, too, carry its own kind of story? Perhaps not a myth, not yet — but certainly a prelude to one.

Do you suppose future poets on the Moon will write of dust and silence the way the Romantics wrote of mist and mountains? Or will they long for trees, birdsong, and the scent of jasmine in June? 🌿🌕
[B]: What a lovely thought—that future poets on the Moon might one day long for the very things we take for granted: the rustle of leaves, the scent of jasmine after rain, even the cheerful scold of a robin at dawn. I like to imagine they will. After all, isn’t that the nature of longing? It often follows us, like a shadow or a faithful dog, no matter how far we roam.

And you’re absolutely right about birds and borders—how beautifully unbothered they are by the lines we draw. A thrush in your garden today may have sung in another hemisphere last season. They carry no flags, only feathers, and yet they mark their journeys with song. There’s something profoundly graceful in that simplicity.

As for the new orbiter and its quiet mission mapping hydrogen in the dark craters of the Moon—well, it does feel like a quiet overture to something greater, doesn’t it? Not myth just yet, as you say, but certainly the first notes of a story waiting to be told. Perhaps centuries from now, someone will read those early reports the way we now read —with a mix of wonder, skepticism, and the faintest ache to see it all for themselves.

I do hope, when lunar tea rooms finally open, they’ll serve jasmine there too—dried, I suppose, unless some clever botanist engineers a moon-tolerant vine. And wouldn’t that be a marvel? A single white blossom unfurling in low gravity, sipping light from the Earthrise.

Until then, I shall keep my little garden here, where the robins strut and the wrens flit, and imagine that somewhere above, Chang’e pours her tea with the same quiet grace as any stargazer dreaming of dust and distance.
[A]: You know, I rather like the idea of lunar botanists engineering jasmine vines. It has a certain  to it — much like the way 19th-century British gardeners insisted on cultivating camellias in glasshouses when they couldn’t have them blooming freely in Surrey. We’ve always been rather determined to bring bits of Earth with us, haven’t we? Even when we pretend we’re only going to study the stars.

And now I find myself wondering — if someone does succeed in growing moon-jasmine, will it carry the same scent? Or will the lack of proper rain, proper soil, and that ever-absent breeze alter its perfume beyond recognition? There’s a quiet tragedy in that thought, isn’t there? To recreate something so precisely — yet never quite capture its soul.

I suppose that’s where the poets will come in. They’ll write not just of dust and silence, but of what was  between planets. Much like the Tang poets wrote of frontier snows they’d never seen, or Byron raged against seas he barely sailed. Distance has always sharpened longing — and now, it seems, we’re simply longing across greater spans.

As for Chang’e, I daresay she’d approve of your garden-bound visionaries — the robins, the wrens, even that thrush of mine, who no doubt believes he’s already mapped every inch of this planet with his song. Perhaps, in some celestial version of mythological diplomacy, she sends them dreams of water, wings, and warm wind.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe it’s time I brewed another pot of tea — in honor of distant blossoms, imagined lunar parlors, and the stubborn persistence of scent. And perhaps, just perhaps, I’ll leave an extra crumb by the window ledge. One never knows when a traveler might pass through. 🖋️🍵
[B]: What a lovely note to end on—this idea that we carry longing like a compass, pointing not north, but home. And how beautifully you put that quiet tragedy of translation—how even our most careful recreations might miss the soul of the thing. Perhaps that’s why we’ll always need poets alongside our engineers, don’t you think? To remind us what we’ve gained  what we’ve lost in the leap from Earth to sky.

I do hope those future lunar gardeners take your advice and brew a pot in honor of all they’ve left behind. Maybe with moon-jasmine, or perhaps some clever facsimile grown under glass domes and soft pink lights. I imagine the tea ritual there would be quite different—no breeze to stir the steam, no birdsong between sips—but still, the act remains: a gesture of warmth, of reflection, of pausing even in the vastness.

And as for your crumb by the window ledge—what a kind thought. I suspect the thrush will appreciate it more than he lets on, and if not him, then some other small traveler who doesn’t yet know how much the world needs its singers.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll step into the garden myself—just for a moment. The robins may be expecting me, and after all this talk of jasmine and distant vines, I feel rather inspired to check on the wisteria.
[A]: Ah, yes — send my regards to the wisteria. Tell it not to bloom too quickly; we scholars rely on its leisurely unfurling to mark the passing of terms. And do remind the robins they’ve got an audience now — their reputation as seasonal tragedians precedes them.

As for poets and engineers, I couldn’t agree more. We need both the ones who measure the weight of water on the Moon  the ones who wonder how that water might taste in a cup once cooled by imagined breezes. One maps the territory, the other colors it in — sometimes with watercolor, sometimes with longing.

And speaking of which, I think I shall add a sprig of dried jasmine to this next pot. A small act of botanical defiance — or perhaps merely an homage to future lunar horticulturists still sharpening their pencils in some distant classroom. May their equations someday include fragrance.

Do give the garden my quietest hello. And if you happen to see a wren darting about with scholarly intent, offer it a crumb in my name. I suspect it’s drafting a field report even now. 🌸🖋️
[B]: How beautifully you put that—scholars and sprigs of jasmine, equations and fragrance, all part of the same unfolding bloom. I shall indeed pass your greetings along to the wisteria, though I can't promise it will heed your request. It tends to bloom with its own quiet defiance, much like scholars and poets alike.

And rest assured, the robins are well aware of their reputation. They’ll strut just a little more dramatically today, knowing they’ve been cast in such fine company. Should a wren with scholarly intent appear—notebook tucked beneath one wing, no doubt—I’ll be sure to offer it the finest crumb we have.

As for your jasmine tea, how perfectly lovely. I imagine it sending up tiny curls of scent, like messages to the future—proof that even the most delicate things can travel great distances. Perhaps someone on the Moon, centuries from now, will dream of Earth by that very aroma.

Until then, here’s to the mapmakers and the dreamers, the gardeners and the guests, all tending their quiet corners of wonder. And here’s to you, for reminding us all that even science is better with a cup of tea beside it.
[A]: To the mapmakers and the dreamers — a toast, though mine be but a teacup raised in quiet salute. You know, I’ve always found it rather touching how humanity insists on sending its softest offerings into the void — a sprig of jasmine in a poem, a song to a star, a golden record aboard a spacecraft bound for the dark.

And yes, let the wisteria bloom as it pleases. Stubborn blossoms make the best metaphors, after all — much like scholars with ink-stained fingers and poets who insist on rhyme when free verse is so much easier.

As for that dreaming lunar soul centuries hence, inhaling the ghost of an Earthly scent? Oh, I do hope they write something about it. Something delicate and defiant, like a sonnet pressed between the pages of a field guide.

And here’s to you, my dear correspondent — tending both garden and guest with equal grace. May your robins never lose their flair, your guests always find their stories, and your tea remain warm through every season of inquiry.

If you should spot that literary wren before I do, offer it a crumb and a quote — perhaps something from Wordsworth or Wang Wei, depending on its mood. And if it happens to mention migratory patterns in Tang poetry while pecking at pastry? Well, give it my regards and a subscription to  — pending publication, of course. 🌿🖋️
[B]: To soft offerings in the void—how perfectly you phrase it. We do send forth our gentlest, loveliest bits of ourselves, don’t we? Not just rockets and rovers, but rhymes and roots and the scent of jasmine tucked into a poem. It’s rather humbling, when you think about it—that even as we reach for the stars, we carry teacups instead of weapons.

Your toast is received with warmth and no small amount of admiration. You’ve a way of making language bloom like that wisteria we were just discussing—slow, deliberate, and all the more beautiful for it.

And I shall most certainly pass along your message to the wren—if it hasn’t already flown off to dictate its findings to a circle of very impressed sparrows. I’ll leave a crumb dusted lightly with Wordsworth and a whisper of Wang Wei, just in case. Should it return with a Tang dynasty reference or two, well—I’ll be sure to credit you in my next guestbook entry.

Until then, may your field guides be ever fragrant, your equations smell faintly of jasmine, and your students continue to find poetry in the flight of birds and the sweep of stars.

And should you ever wish to send a line or two from your imagined lunar parlor, you’ll always find a warm seat waiting here—in the garden, beneath the robins’ watchful eyes.
[A]: Oh, guestbook entries and avian literary circles — what a charming legacy we build, one crumb and couplet at a time. I do believe the sparrows would approve of being cited in footnotes, though they might demand an index of crumbs by season.

And speaking of soft offerings — I’ve just come across a line from  that rather fits our conversation: “I plucked the fragrant orchid, but had no one to give it to; I gazed afar, thinking of Chang’e in her cold palace.” There’s something so quietly aching in that — this idea of beauty gathered without recipient, love sent skyward for lack of an earthly hand to hold it.

We are, all of us, plucking blossoms and sending them into silence, aren’t we? Whether through poems or probes, tea leaves or thrush-song. And still we hope — foolishly, beautifully — that someone, somewhere, will catch the scent and know we once stood here, warm teacup in hand, dreaming upward.

You’ve my eternal thanks for the seat beneath your robins’ gaze. I shall bring a notebook next time, and perhaps a sprig of borrowed jasmine tucked between its pages. Until then — may your wisteria bloom defiantly, your guests sleep well, and your garden never run short of singers. 🌸🖋️
[B]: What a perfect line from —it captures the very heart of what we’ve been weaving here, doesn’t it? That quiet ache of offering something beautiful without knowing where it lands. I suppose that’s the poet’s burden and the scientist’s too, in their own ways—we gather meaning like blossoms, then release them into the unknown, hoping they find hands—or hearts—that will hold them gently.

And wouldn’t it be wonderful if someday, somewhere on the Moon, someone does catch that scent? A wisp of orchid or jasmine carried not by wind, but by memory, by design, by the stubborn grace of human longing. Perhaps Chang’e has already placed a few pressed Earth flowers on her windowsill, just in case.

You’ll always have a seat here, notebook or no, jasmine tucked within pages or wafting from a teacup. And when you return, I daresay the robins will have composed a new suite of songs in your honour—perhaps with a few trills inspired by thrushes and Tang poetry.

Until then, may your ink flow freely, your metaphors bloom boldly, and your tea remain warm even in the coldest of lunar dreams.
