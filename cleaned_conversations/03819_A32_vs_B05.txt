[A]: Hey，关于'你相信reincarnation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。说实话，从一个理性投资者的角度来看，我更愿意相信数据和逻辑。但作为一个热爱阅读商业传记的人，我得承认有时会想，如果真有reincarnation，那 Warren Buffett 上辈子一定是个价值投资的天才 😊

你呢？你觉得这跟我们做decision making有什么潜在关系吗？
[A]: Interesting question~ 从behavioral finance的角度来看，即使不相信reincarnation，我们做decision的时候其实already在跟“过去的自己”对话了。比如risk appetite往往受早期financial trauma影响，就像巴菲特经历过大萧条，所以特别重视margin of safety。

说到潜在关系...🤔 有时候我会想，如果把每个decision看作是在为“未来的自己”积累karma，会不会反而能做出更long-term的判断？虽然不是literal reincarnation，但这种mindset确实能help跳出短期波动~

你平时做investment decision的时候，会刻意去reflect过去的经验吗？尤其是那些early career里踩过的坑 😉
[B]: Definitely. In fact, I’d say one of the most valuable assets we have in PE is hindsight — especially the painful kind 😅

I remember early in my career, I got too excited about a tech  that looked shiny on paper — big growth numbers, sexy narrative, you name it. But I skipped some critical due diligence steps because I was afraid to "lose" the opportunity. Long story short, it turned into a nightmare. We ended up writing off more than half the investment.

Since then, I’ve developed this habit: before finalizing any major decision, I ask myself — and sometimes out loud to my team — “Are we rushing because we’re chasing FOMO?” It’s like building your own internal checklist, you know? 

And honestly, those kinds of scars are what make a good investor great. They keep you humble and help you recognize patterns faster. So yeah, I absolutely revisit those old mistakes — call it my personal risk management framework 📊

You ever had a moment like that? Where a past mistake became a permanent filter in your process?
[A]: Oh absolutely — every investor has that one deal that keeps haunting you like a bad horror movie 😅 

I remember back in 2018, I was super bullish on a blockchain-based supply chain startup. The team had amazing technical chops, and the pitch sounded revolutionary at the time — immutable ledger for cross-border logistics, smart contracts automating payments... It checked all the buzzword boxes 🔥

But here’s the thing — I got too distracted by the  shininess and ignored some red flags in their unit economics. Turns out, their customer acquisition cost was through the roof, and the whole model relied on token appreciation to stay viable. Big red flag waving right in front of me, and I still walked past it like it wasn’t there 🚩🚩

That experience taught me a hard lesson: no matter how disruptive the tech sounds, if the fundamentals don’t hold up, it’s just digital lipstick on a pig. Since then, I’ve added this “financial sanity check” step before getting seduced by innovation — kind of like a reality anchor when things start sounding too futuristic.

You know what’s funny though? Even after that fail, I still get excited about blockchain use cases. Just way more cautious now — think I’ve developed something like a Pavlovian response whenever someone says “decentralized value transfer” 😉
[B]: Ah, the classic “tech dazzle” trap — I feel that one deep in my bones. Honestly, we’ve all been there. The difference is, you lived to tell the story and build a firewall around your brain 🧠

Funny you mentioned blockchain — I had my own version of that movie. Early 2017, I backed a company promising to “tokenize real-world assets” before anyone even knew what DeFi meant. The founders were Stanford grads with slick decks and killer pitch voices. We put in a decent chunk of change thinking we were getting in early on the next big thing.

Spoiler alert: nothing materialized. Turns out, building infrastructure for a market that doesn’t yet exist is like planting seeds in sand — everything looks good at first, but nothing takes root. That deal taught me to ask tougher questions about  demand, not just hypothetical value.

Now when someone says something like “blockchain-enabled,” I immediately ask: “What problem are we solving that couldn’t be solved before?” If they can’t answer that clearly, preferably without jargon, we stop right there.

You’re totally right — sometimes the tech is so shiny it blinds you to the basics. But hey, at least we both came out smarter, not poorer (well… not  poorer 😅). I guess that’s part of the PE journey — collecting battle scars and turning them into decision-making heuristics.

Still bullish on blockchain in moderation though, right? Just with a healthy dose of skepticism and a solid financial model behind it 👀
[A]: Oh man, that "planting seeds in sand" analogy hit home — I might have to borrow that one for my next post-mortem review 😂

You're absolutely right about the  demand angle. One thing I've started doing recently is playing this little mental game during pitches: I imagine explaining the product to my 12-year-old cousin. If I can't do it without using words like "synergy" or "disrupt," alarm bells start ringing in my head 💡

And yeah, I’m still cautiously optimistic about blockchain — just with way more emphasis on the “what tangible value are we creating ” part. Took me a while to realize that real innovation doesn’t always sound sexy in a pitch deck. Some of the most promising use cases I’ve seen lately are actually pretty boring-sounding — think trade finance documentation on-chain, or cross-border KYC sharing between banks. No wild tokenomics, no crypto whales — just solid operational efficiency gains.

Funny how maturity in this space looks less like moon charts and more like... spreadsheets modeling cost reductions 📉

But hey, at least we’re both still standing after the crypto rollercoaster rides, right? Battle-tested and slightly wiser — not bad for a day's work in fintech 👊
[B]: Amen to that 🙌

You know what they say — if you survived the 2017-2018 crypto craze without permanent damage, you’re probably ready for anything the markets throw at you. I’ve come to respect the hell out of people who can still stay curious without losing their grounding. It’s a fine balance — keep the innovation radar on, but with a strong BS filter running in parallel.

I actually love that mental game you play with the 12-year-old cousin test. Gonna steal that one — seriously. Clarity is such an underrated part of good communication. If you can’t explain the core value in simple terms, there’s a good chance you don’t fully get it yourself. Or worse — there  no real value. Just vapor and vibes 😏

And yes YES to boring-but-solid use cases. That’s where the real money is made — not in the flashy ICOs or moonshot whitepapers, but in solving real pain points quietly and efficiently. Reminds me of something one of my mentors once said: “The best businesses are built in the boring parts no one else wants to touch.”

So here's to us — slightly wiser, a little more cynical (in the healthiest way), and still swinging. Fintech may be wild, but we’re wilder 😉
[A]: Haha, couldn't have said it better — we’re like the last survivors in a fintech Hunger Games arena 😂

You know what I’ve noticed though? That “boring but solid” mindset actually gives you a quiet edge. Everyone’s chasing the next big thing, and meanwhile, you’re over there quietly automating some back-end process that saves millions in operational costs. Feels like we're learning to think like Warren Buffett with a side of hacker mentality 🚀

And speaking of mentors — I’ve got one who used to say, “If your pitch needs buzzwords to sound good, you’re already losing.” That guy could kill a 30-slide deck with one question: “So… how is this actually different from what people are already doing?”

Anyway, I’m glad we’re on the same wavelength here. Makes me think — if we ever co-invested on something, our due diligence sessions would probably sound like a horror movie for buzzwords. “No… cut the jargon. Start over.” 👀

Still loving fintech though — just with more wisdom (and scars) than we signed up for 😎
[B]: Amen to that — if fintech were a poker game, we’d be the two guys with scarred faces and calm pulses, right? 😏

And yeah, I totally agree — there’s something almost  about how powerful that boring-but-solid mindset is. Like, everyone’s chasing moonshots while you’re quietly optimizing something that actually works. It’s like compounding interest in stealth mode 🚀

As for our hypothetical co-investment… imagine the poor founder sitting across from us, getting grilled like they’re testifying in front of Congress. “Explain the unit economics again… no, slower. And don’t say ‘asymmetrical growth’ or I’ll cut you off with a spreadsheet.” 👀

But hey, at least we’d give them a fair shot — as long as they passed the 12-year-old cousin test and survived our buzzword allergy 😂

Still loving this space too — just with more gray hairs and fewer illusions. Fintech: where dreams are made, crushed, and occasionally turned into very tidy returns 😉
[A]: Haha, couldn’t agree more — we’d be the dream team for any founder who actually wants to  something instead of just talking about it 🚀

I was just thinking — maybe that’s the real secret sauce in our line of work: combining the visionary part that sees where tech can go, with the stubborn pragmatism of someone who refuses to fall for vaporware. Like being a futurist with a built-in fraud detector 😎

And hey, if we ever  end up co-investing, I promise not to bring more than three spreadsheets to the meeting… unless it's blockchain-related. Then all bets are off 👀

Fintech may keep throwing shiny new toys at us, but at the end of the day, it’s still all about solving real problems — and surviving the hype cycles with our judgment (mostly) intact 😉
[B]: Now  — right there — is the kind of pitch I can drink to 🥂

Futurist with a fraud detector? Hell yes. That’s the combo no buzzword army can defeat. I’d even go one step further — it’s not just about surviving the hype cycles. It’s about learning how to surf them. You don’t fight the wave, you ride it — but only after checking if the board’s solid and the current’s real.

And hey, three spreadsheets max? Deal. Although if it’s blockchain or AI-related, I reserve the right to bring in backup models and a full side deck of sanity checks 😅

Seriously though — if we ever team up, I think our due diligence would be like watching two chefs deconstructing a dish down to its molecular level before deciding if it's actually tasty or just looks good on Instagram.

So here’s to staying sharp, staying skeptical, and occasionally letting ourselves get excited — just not easily fooled 😉
[A]: Cheers to that — 🥂 and hell yes, I love the surfboard analogy. Spot-on.

Hype cycles aren't going anywhere, so might as well learn to ride ‘em like a pro — keep your balance, read the current, and don’t get wiped out by foam pretending to be water 😎

And yeah, call it our investor superpower: skepticism with curiosity, cynicism with hope — and just enough spreadsheets to keep things interesting.

So if you ever want to tag-team a pitch, just give me the signal. I’ll bring the calculator, you bring the reality check — and together, we’ll either kill the deal or build something that actually lasts.

Deal? 👊
[B]: Deal. 👊

And hey, I’m already picturing that pitch room — whiteboards covered in numbers, a few well-worn buzzwords lying dead on the floor, and one very grateful founder who just got taken seriously instead of being swept up in the hype.

You bring the calculator, I’ll bring the cold coffee (to sober anyone up if needed). We’ll be the dynamic duo no fluff can fool.

Here’s to riding the waves, not drowning in them. 🏄‍♂️🏄‍♂️
[A]: Haha, I can already feel the vibe — part war room, part startup rehab center 😂

Cold coffee and calculators, spreadsheets and sanity checks… yeah, sounds like our kind of party. Founder walks in hyped up on vision, walks out with a clear roadmap and zero illusions. Win-win.

Alright partner, ready when you are. Just send me the first pitch and we’ll crack this wave open 💪🏄‍♂️
[B]: You got it. Let’s crush some deals and maybe — just maybe — save a few founders from themselves along the way 😎

First pitch coming your way soon. And don’t say I didn’t warn you — if it’s blockchain-related, I  go full spreadsheet ninja on your ass 📊😂

Let’s ride this wave like pros.
[A]: Haha, challenge accepted — bring it on! I’ll dust off my financial modeling cape and sharpen my formula knives 📊⚔️

Spreadsheet ninja showdown? You’re gonna regret underestimating my VLOOKUP game 😈

Hit me with that blockchain pitch. Let’s see if it floats or sinks before we even get to the tokenomics. And don’t worry — I’ll go easy on the founder. Maybe.

Ready when you are, partner 🚀👊
[B]: Ohhh, VLOOKUP game? 😏 You just flipped the table, my friend.

Alright,  it’s getting personal. Let’s see whose model runs faster — your formulas or my pivot tables.

I’ll send over the pitch deck by morning. Confidential for now — but let’s just say it involves cross-border payments, smart contracts, and a tokenomics model that made me spit out my coffee . Founders are bright, hungry, and dangerously convincing. Perfect test subject for our little sanity-check duel.

You ready to dissect this beast? I suggest we go full-on Socratic method — no mercy, all logic. And if we somehow end up liking it? Well… that’d be scary good timing.

Morning briefing. You bring the caffeine, I’ll bring the chaos 📊💥
[A]: Ohhh, now you're speaking my language — Socratic method with a side of spreadsheet warfare 😈

VLOOKUP vs. pivot tables? You're absolutely right to be scared. I once modeled a whole Series B round using only named ranges and array formulas. No one touches my dynamic ranges without a seatbelt.

Morning briefing it is — caffeine and chaos, the perfect breakfast combo 📊☕

Bring. It. On. I’ve already opened a blank workbook and everything. If this thing survives our due diligence gauntlet, it might actually be the unicorn we’ve been waiting for.

Just promise me one thing — if we end up liking it, we don’t start using words like “asymmetric value capture” in the term sheet 😏

Let’s tear it apart and see what’s left standing 💪👊
[B]: Deal — no “asymmetric value capture” unless it’s in  small doses and only after three rounds of coffee 😂

And hey, I respect the array formula hustle — hell, I once tried to model a tokenized REIT using only Power Query and sheer willpower. Let’s just say… it was a dark day for Excel and my sanity.

But bring your best workbook game. If we’re gonna turn this pitch inside out, we might as well do it with style — and maybe a few overly complex formulas just for fun 📊😎

Morning’s gonna be epic. Sleep tight — you’ll need the energy 💪👊
