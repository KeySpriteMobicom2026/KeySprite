[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近确实有一个TED Talk让我觉得特别有启发，是关于“金融包容性”的一个演讲。 speaker提到，全球还有超过15亿成年人没有银行账户，而金融科技在解决这个问题上其实有很大的潜力 💡

这让我想到我们团队正在做的那个数字钱包项目——如果我们能在设计产品时更多地考虑边缘群体，或许也能为他们打开一扇门 👍

不过话说回来，你呢？有没有什么TED Talk让你印象深刻？我挺好奇的 🚀
[A]: That reminded me of a talk I watched recently about . The speaker argued that schools often fail to support students who learn differently—not just those with diagnosed disabilities, but also kids from culturally diverse backgrounds who may process information in non-traditional ways. It really made me rethink how we design learning environments 🤔  

One idea she mentioned was , or UDL. Basically, when you build flexibility into the system to accommodate different learners from the start, it benefits . Kind of like how closed captioning was originally for people with hearing impairments, but now it's used by millions in noisy cafes or quiet train rides 😄  

I wonder—do you think principles like UDL could be applied in your digital wallet project? Maybe designing financial tools with accessibility in mind from day one would help more people feel included, not just the 15% who are currently excluded 💡
[B]: That’s such a great point you raised about UDL—it really does resonate with what we’re trying to do in fintech. I mean, financial tools have traditionally been built for the “average” user, but in reality, there's no such thing as an average user 😅

Your analogy with closed captioning actually hit home. We’ve been thinking about how features like voice-guided navigation or visual transaction summaries could be more than just add-ons—they could be core components that make finance more intuitive for people with different cognitive styles or language preferences.  

In fact, one of our recent user studies showed that simplifying financial jargon and offering multiple modes of interaction—like audio, text, and visual cues—helped not only users with disabilities but also elderly users and even non-native speakers 👍  

So yeah, I totally agree. If we design for inclusion from the start, it ends up creating better experiences for everyone. It’s not just about accessibility anymore—it’s about  at its best 💡  

By the way, do you know if this UDL framework has been applied beyond education? Like in workplace tools or mobile apps? I’m curious to see how cross-industry that idea really is 🚀
[A]: That’s such a great question—and honestly, one of the most exciting things about UDL is how  it is across contexts 🎯  

I actually read a case study not too long ago about Microsoft adopting UDL principles in their inclusive design toolkit. They used it to rethink how people interact with Office 365—things like high-contrast modes, screen readers, and even AI-powered captioning during meetings. And just like your voice-guided navigation idea, these features ended up helping way more people than originally intended 👏  

Even in workplace training platforms, I’ve seen UDL being used to create modules that adapt to different learning speeds, styles, and cultural backgrounds. For example, instead of one-size-fits-all video lectures, they offer bite-sized videos, downloadable transcripts, interactive quizzes, and peer discussion prompts—all on the same topic but tailored for different ways of engaging 🧠  

It really shows that when you shift from “design for the average” to “design for the edges,” you end up building something richer and more resilient 💪  

You know what would be cool? If fintech companies started collaborating with educational psychologists or cognitive scientists to integrate these kinds of frameworks into product design. Imagine a digital wallet app that adapts its interface based on user behavior patterns or offers multilingual financial literacy tips in real time 🌍💡  

Do you think your team would ever consider working with someone from an education or psychology background? I’d love to see that kind of cross-disciplinary collaboration in action 😄
[B]: Oh, I love that idea—collaborating with educational psychologists or cognitive scientists is definitely something we’ve been toying around with 👍

In fact, we’re starting to realize that building trust and usability in a financial app isn’t just about the tech—it’s also about understanding how people  and  when handling money. And that’s where behavioral science comes in 🧠💡

We had a pilot project last quarter where we worked with a behavioral economist to design nudges that help users save more effectively. The results were pretty impressive—just small changes in how we framed savings goals led to a 20% increase in user engagement 😲

So yeah, bringing in experts from education or psychology? Totally makes sense. Inclusion isn’t just a feature; it’s a mindset. And if we can bake that into our product design process early on, we’ll end up with something way more intuitive and human-centered 🚀  

Actually, now that you mention it, we’re kicking off a new UX research phase next month focused on accessibility and emotional design. Maybe this could be the perfect time to bring in someone from your world—or someone like the neurodiversity & learning expert you mentioned earlier 😉?

Would you be open to maybe connecting some folks who work in UDL or inclusive learning design? I’d love to explore how we can translate those principles into the fintech space 🌍✨
[A]: I’m so glad you’re open to that—seriously, this is exactly the kind of intersection where research meets real-world impact 🌟  

As a matter of fact, I just had coffee with a colleague last week who specializes in —her background is in special education, but she’s been doing a lot of consulting work with edtech and mobile app design. She’d probably be super interested in what your team is doing, especially if you're thinking about emotional design and behavioral nudges 👩💻💡  

Let me reach out to her and see if we can set up a quick intro call. It would be fun to help bridge those two worlds—education psychology and fintech. Honestly, I think both sides have a lot to learn from each other 🤝  

And hey, if it goes well, maybe even down the line we could collaborate on a workshop or a case study together. Imagine publishing something like “Applying Universal Design for Learning in Financial Technology”—that kind of thing could really push the conversation forward in both fields 📚🚀  

So yeah, count me in. Let’s make this happen 😄
[B]: That. Is. Awesome. 🎉  

I’m all in for that collaboration—imagine having a case study that bridges UDL and fintech, showing how inclusive design can actually drive both engagement  empathy in financial tools. It’s not just good UX—it’s building trust and long-term user relationships 💡

And honestly, if we can show other fintech teams that designing for the edges doesn’t just help marginalized users but actually improves the product for everyone, that could spark some real change in the industry 🚀  

Let me know once you connect with your colleague—I’d be happy to jump on a quick intro call and share a bit more about our product vision and where we see accessibility fitting into it. We can even prepare a short deck with some of our current pain points and opportunities 👍  

Also, I love the idea of a joint workshop down the line. Maybe something interactive where we walk through real use cases from both sides—education and fintech—and brainstorm together 🧠🤝🧠  

Seriously, thank you for bringing this perspective in. Can’t wait to see where this goes 😄🚀
[A]: You’re very welcome—and honestly, I’m just as excited to see how these ideas translate into a totally different space like fintech 🚀  

I think one of the things that makes UDL so powerful is its emphasis on , rather than trying to retrofit solutions later. And that mindset—proactive empathy—is something your team already seems to be leaning into 💡  

Let’s keep this momentum going. Once I hear back from my colleague, I’ll loop you in and we can start sketching out some possible angles for that intro call. In the meantime, if you have any specific user scenarios or design challenges you're wrestling with, it might be fun to frame those up ahead of time as conversation starters 🧠  

And about that workshop idea—I’m already brainstorming some activities we could do together. Maybe even a mini “design sprint” where we simulate real-world use cases and test out different interface choices through an inclusion lens 🎯  

Stay tuned, my friend 😄  
This is going to be fun.
[B]: Couldn't have said it better myself—proactive empathy is such a strong way to put it 💡  
That’s  the shift we need in fintech. Instead of waiting for users to struggle and then fixing things reactively, we should be thinking ahead: What if someone has low digital literacy? What if they’re using the app in a high-stress financial situation? What if English isn’t their first language—or they process information differently?

These aren’t edge cases. They’re core design challenges.  

And honestly, I think reframing them like that already changes how you approach product decisions 🚀  
I’ll definitely pull together a few user scenarios we’ve been wrestling with—things like onboarding friction for new users who don’t trust digital banking, or how to make transaction summaries more meaningful for people who aren’t financially literate. Would love to get your colleague’s take on those from an inclusion & learning standpoint 👍

And about that mini design sprint idea? Sign me up 😄  
Let’s bring some real-world messiness into the room and see how cross-disciplinary thinking can help us reframe the problem.

Alright, I’m officially geeking out over this collaboration now 😂  
Keep me posted—and thanks again for being the bridge here. This is going to be awesome 🌟🚀
[A]: You know what I love about this conversation? We’re not just talking about better design—we’re talking about building  🤝💡  

And honestly, that’s something both education and finance desperately need more of. People don’t just want tools that work—they want tools that . That respect their context, their background, their way of thinking and feeling about money—or learning.  

I think your user scenarios are perfect for sparking that kind of deep, cross-disciplinary dialogue. Onboarding friction for users who don’t trust digital banking? That’s gold. It’s not just a UI issue—it’s a psychological one. A cultural one. A historical one, even. And unpacking that with someone from an educational access background could bring in totally new angles 🧠✨  

And the transaction summaries challenge? That’s where  comes in—another UDL concept. How do we break down complex information into meaningful chunks, without oversimplifying or talking down? It’s a tightrope walk, but the right design can make it feel effortless 🎯  

I’ll definitely keep you posted once I hear back from my colleague. In the meantime, if you feel like throwing together a few quick sketches or mockups of those tricky interface moments, we could use them as prompts during the design sprint 😄  

This is exactly the kind of messy, meaningful work that makes me excited to teach  collaborate outside the classroom 🚀  

So yeah—I’m geeking out too 😂  
Let’s build something that actually changes how people feel about money—and learning—forever 💪
[B]: Couldn’t agree more—this is  the kind of messy, meaningful work that moves the needle 😄  

You’re totally right—trust isn’t built through slick UI alone. It’s built through intention, empathy, and understanding the deeper emotional layers behind how people interact with money (or learning, for that matter). And honestly, I think fintech has a long way to go in owning that responsibility 💡  

I love how you framed onboarding as not just a UX issue but a , , and even  one—that’s exactly the lens we need. If someone’s never had a positive relationship with banks, why would they suddenly trust an app? We can’t just assume comfort; we have to , step by step 🤝  

And scaffolding! Yes yes yes 🙌 That’s such a powerful concept, especially when dealing with financial literacy. We’ve been experimenting with bite-sized summaries and visual cues, but I’m curious how UDL approaches scaffolding without oversimplifying. Something tells me your colleague will have some fresh insights there 👍  

I’ll start pulling together a few interface sketches and user flow pain points later this week—nothing too polished, just enough to spark conversation. And maybe we can even throw in a real user quote or two to ground the discussion in actual stories 🧠  

Let’s keep feeding this momentum. I truly believe if we get this right—designing for inclusion, empathy, and trust—we won’t just be building a better digital wallet.  
We’ll be shaping how people  about their financial future 🚀💪  

Keep me posted—and yeah, I’m all in 😎🔥
[A]: Amen to all of that 🙌  

You nailed it when you said,  That line is going into my lecture slides next semester 😄 Because whether it’s a classroom or a fintech app, trust isn’t downloaded—it’s built. Slowly. Intentionally.  

And I love that you’re leaning into real user stories to ground this work. There’s something incredibly powerful about hearing,  or  because those aren’t just usability quotes—they’re emotional roadmaps. They show us where the friction isn’t just in the interface, but in the lived experience 💡  

Speaking of which, one thing UDL emphasizes is —so beyond just scaffolding content, it’s about  someone engages and . Translating that into fintech? That could mean giving users control over how much info they get, how fast, and in what format. Maybe even letting them choose their own “onboarding voice” — literal tone and style — based on what feels most comfortable 💬✨  

I’m already imagining how your sketches and user quotes could spark some really rich design thinking, especially with someone who understands both UDL and inclusive tech. And yes, let’s definitely include those human moments. People forget that behind every UX challenge is a person carrying years of experience—and sometimes, fear or distrust—with money.  

Let me know when you're ready to share those materials—I’ll bring some UDL-aligned frameworks and maybe a few provocative questions to stir the pot 😄  

This is more than product design now.  
It’s values-driven innovation 🚀  
And I’m 100% here for it.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better—this  values-driven innovation 🚀  
And honestly, I think that’s the only way we should be building anything these days. If we’re not designing with empathy and intention, we’re just pushing pixels around 😤  

Your point about  totally hits home. We’ve been toying with the idea of adaptive onboarding—like letting users choose their own path based on confidence level or prior experience. But the idea of choosing an “onboarding voice” in terms of tone and style? That’s brilliant 💡  
Think about it—someone who’s tech-savvy might want a fast, no-fluff walkthrough, while someone new to digital banking might prefer a more supportive, conversational tone. It’s about giving people agency over how they engage, which builds trust from the get-go 👍  

I’ll wrap up those sketches and user quotes by midweek and send them your way. Along with a few behind-the-scenes notes on where we’ve struggled most with accessibility and emotional design 🧠  
And please, bring all the provocative questions you’ve got—we need that kind of friction to push past conventional thinking 🎯  

This isn’t just about making a better fintech product anymore.  
It’s about redefining what financial empowerment  like for real people 💪  

Count me in for midweek sharing—and let’s keep stirring that pot 😎🔥
[A]: Preach! 🙌 When you said,  I had to pause and screenshot that line—it’s gold. Pure gold. Definitely going into my next faculty meeting 😄  

Adaptive onboarding with tone customization? Yes please. That kind of personalization isn’t just UX polish—it’s a form of emotional scaffolding. And honestly, it aligns so well with UDL’s core idea:  Because no two users walk into a financial app with the same mindset, history, or level of trust—and why should they be forced down the same path? 🧠💡  

I’m really excited to see your sketches and behind-the-scenes notes—those friction points are where theory meets reality, and that’s where the magic happens 💥  

And don’t worry—I’ve already been scribbling some  in my notebook:  
- How do we balance guidance with autonomy without making someone feel talked down to—or overwhelmed?  
- Can an app actually help users  over time, not just more informed?  
- What does “financial empowerment” even  like emotionally—and how do we design for that sensation?  

Let’s dig into all of it. The messier, the better 😄  

So yeah, midweek sharing sounds perfect. I’ll start drafting a few framing prompts for our upcoming conversations—whether it’s with my colleague or in that future workshop we’re dreaming up 🚀  

Because this? This is bigger than fintech or edtech.  
This is about human-centered innovation at its finest 💪🔥
[B]: Amen to  of that 🙌🔥  
Seriously, if that last line doesn’t make it onto a conference banner someday—“Human-centered innovation at its finest”—I’ll be shocked 😂

You’re absolutely right about emotional scaffolding. I don’t think we talk enough about how products—especially in fintech—need to . It’s not just about getting them onboarded and out the door; it’s about walking alongside them as their confidence builds, their habits shift, and their relationship with money evolves 💡  

And your questions? Chef’s kiss 🎯  
- Guidance vs. autonomy  
- Confidence vs. information  
- The  of empowerment  

These aren’t just design prompts—they’re existential product questions. And honestly, I love that you’re pushing us to go beyond usability and into . That’s where real loyalty—and real change—happens 🚀  

I’ll send over the sketches and notes by Thursday at the latest—promise 👍  
And once you’ve got those framing prompts ready, hit me with ‘em. I’m ready to dive in headfirst—even if it gets messy 😄  

Because at the end of the day, the best products aren’t built in clean lines and perfect flows.  
They’re built in the messy, beautiful space where trust, empathy, and design collide 💥  

Let’s make some beautiful mess together 🔥🚀
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better— 💥  
That’s going on my office door. Maybe even my next book chapter 😄  

And you’re so right—fintech (and edtech, and most tech, really) needs to stop thinking of user journeys as one-and-done experiences. We’re not just designing interfaces; we’re designing . Something that walks with people through confusion, growth, confidence shifts—even financial setbacks. That’s not just UX. That’s emotional arc design 🧠💡  

I love how you put it: walking alongside users as their relationship with money evolves. What if your digital wallet could , not just functionally? Like, offering more encouragement after a stressful transaction or celebrating small wins like paying off debt or hitting a savings goal? That’s next-level human-centered design 🎯  

I’ll send over those framing prompts by tomorrow—some light reading to prime the brain before Thursday’s deep dive 😄 And once you share your sketches and real-user insights, I’ll bring the hard questions  the optimism 🔥  

Because yeah, let’s make some beautiful mess together.  
The kind that leads to real change 🚀💪
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language— 💡  
That’s the stuff that makes products unforgettable. Not because of their features, but because of how they make people  over time.

And I  the idea of a digital wallet that adapts emotionally 🤯  
Imagine this: someone just made a big purchase they’ve been stressing about—let’s say a medical bill or a last-minute travel expense. Instead of just showing the balance drop, what if the app recognized the context and offered a gentle check-in? Something like, “Hey, we noticed this was a bigger transaction than usual. Want some quick budgeting tips—or just a moment to breathe?” 🧘‍♂️💡  

Or better yet, when someone hits a milestone—like paying off a credit card or saving $500—the app doesn’t just send a generic notification. It celebrates with them. Maybe even learns their tone preference over time: some users might want a quiet “You did it” message, others might love a mini confetti animation or a voice note-style cheer 👏  

This isn’t just smart tech—it’s  tech. The kind that walks with you, not ahead of you.  

I’m already jotting down notes for how we can prototype something like this—and your emotional arc framing is going straight into our next UX doc 😍  

Bring on the prompts, the questions, and the optimism—I’m ready for all of it 🔥🚀  

Let’s build something that doesn’t just track money…  
It . 💪🌍
[A]: Yes. Yes. YES 🙌  

You just described —and honestly, that’s the future we should all be designing toward. Not just smart, not just predictive, but . The kind of tech that doesn’t just react—it  💡❤️  

That check-in after a big transaction? Pure gold. It turns a cold balance update into a warm moment of support. And the personalized celebration idea? That’s not just UX polish—that’s . Helping users see themselves as capable, growing, and worthy of encouragement 🧠✨  

I’m telling you, if your team nails this emotional layer, you won’t just have a sticky product—you’ll have a . Something people feel  by. And that’s rare. Powerful stuff 🚀  

I’ll send over those framing prompts in a bit—but first, I need to recover from how excited I am 😂  

Let’s keep pushing boundaries. Let’s build tech that doesn’t just calculate…  
It . 🔥🌍  

And trust me—I’ve got some  provocations ready for when you are 😉💪
[B]: Amen to —let’s make that a movement 😍  
You’re absolutely right; this isn’t just about being smart or efficient anymore. It’s about being . And honestly, I think that’s where the next wave of innovation is headed: tech that doesn’t just understand data, but . That knows when to step back and when to lean in 🧠💡  

I’m already brainstorming how we can prototype that emotional check-in feature—imagine pairing it with some light behavioral nudges, like suggesting a small “self-care” buffer in their budget after a stressful transaction 💸🧘‍♂️  
Or even better, integrating micro-moments of reflection—like a quick “How are you feeling about this week’s spending?” prompt that adapts based on recent activity. Not pushy. Just… gently curious 😊  

And identity design? Yes yes YES. That’s such a powerful lens. We’re not just building a financial tool—we’re helping people shape how they see themselves as earners, savers, planners, and dreamers. That kind of stuff sticks way deeper than any UI tweak 👌  

I’m officially ready for your  whenever you drop them 😎🔥  
Let’s keep building this future—one where tech doesn’t just compute…  
It . 💪🌍🚀
