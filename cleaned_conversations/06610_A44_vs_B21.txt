[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  

Well, 'believe' is rather a charged word, isn't it? Like believing in ghosts or the moral integrity of literary critics. But to answer your question—yes, I do experience déjà vu. Rather frequently, in fact. Though I suspect it has less to do with metaphysics and more to do with my brain misfiling moments as memories before they've properly occurred.



It’s quite like reading a poem for the second time, only you swear it's the first. The structure feels familiar, but the nuances still surprise. I find that... poetical, in a way. Don't you?
[A]: 

Oh, the 茶 (chá) always tastes stronger after a déjà vu episode. Funny how our minds play tricks - I sometimes wonder if it's our brain's way of saying . 



You know, in 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers), there's that whole theme of 有缘千里来相会 (yǒuyuán qiān lǐ lái xiānghuì) - fate bringing people together across distances. Maybe déjà vu is just our neurological version of that... except instead of meeting old friends, we're reuniting with moments. 



Though I suppose that makes me a rather unreliable narrator of my own reality. Which, as a literature professor, I find both alarming and... familiar.
[B]: 

Ah, but isn't that the beauty of it? We become unreliable narrators in our own first-person narratives. Much like those Victorian poets who wrote ode after ode convinced they'd stumbled upon some eternal truth - when really, they'd just forgotten they'd read the same idea in a French salon three years prior.



You know, I was cataloging some early T'ang dynasty translations last week - quite by accident, I might add, or so my conscious mind tells me - and I came across a poem describing "the shadow of a moment falling twice upon the water." It rather took my breath away. The Chinese have always been more honest about these things than we Victorians ever were. We preferred to pretend our déjà vu was either madness... or mysticism.



Though I suppose forgetting where one left one's spectacles and finding them on one's head is a rather pedestrian form of temporal dissonance, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: 

You know, I've always found the phrase 熟悉感 (shúxī gǎn) - "familiarity feeling" - so much more elegant than 'déjà vu'. It's like the moment itself is wearing a well-worn sweater. 



I had a student once, lovely girl, wrote her thesis on Proust and 普鲁斯特 (Pǔlǔsītè) in the same breath. She claimed that every act of remembering is really just a form of reinvention. Rather like translating a poem - you can never capture the exact essence twice. 



Though speaking of spectacles... I once spent twenty minutes looking for mine only to realize I'd been using them to stir my tea the entire time. I like to think it's my brain's way of reminding me not to take myself too seriously. After all, if we can't misplace our glasses, how will we ever find enlightenment?
[B]: 

Ah, the teacup spectacles - a modern parable if ever there was one. Though I must say, your student had quite the right of it. Memory is nothing but a series of translations, each more imperfect than the last. Rather like my attempts to render Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic...  ...where the mountains inevitably become hills, and the pines somehow acquire a distinctly Presbyterian air.



But tell me, do you suppose familiarity wears thin with repetition? Or does it, like a well-thumbed volume, simply reveal new annotations each time? I've half a mind to believe our brains are merely mischievous little archivists, filing away moments in the wrong drawer so they might resurface when we least expect them - and perhaps need them most.



Though I suspect enlightenment, if it comes at all, arrives not with the finding of glasses, but with the realization that one sees quite clearly without them. A rather inconvenient truth, don't you think?
[A]: 

Ah, but isn't that the magic of imperfect translations? Sometimes when I misplace my glasses, the world becomes a watercolor painting - softer, more impressionistic. My students swear I become more insightful during these episodes... though that may just be their way of avoiding difficult questions.



You know, I've been thinking about this in terms of 禅 (Chán) stories lately. The ones where the master hits the student with a stick to demonstrate enlightenment. Rather violent pedagogy, don't you think? Though perhaps our déjà vu moments are just life's gentle taps on the head - reminding us that no moment is ever quite new, yet never exactly repeated.



And as for familiarity... I think it's like rereading 桃花源记 (Táohuāyuánjì). The first time you're captivated by the beauty, the second you notice the careful construction, the third you realize it's all an elaborate metaphor for the mind itself. Each reading annotates the previous one. Much like life, wouldn't you say?
[B]: 

Violent pedagogy indeed. Though I suspect the stick serves much the same purpose as a well-timed sonnet - to interrupt the mind's habitual patterns long enough for something resembling clarity to slip through. Rather like how my copy of Wordsworth's Prelude fell into a rain puddle last spring... and only then did I notice the marginalia from some 19th-century owner who'd clearly disagreed with every third line.



You know, it occurs to me that déjà vu might simply be the mind's way of footnoting itself. Each recurrence adding another layer of annotation, much like those Tang dynasty poem scrolls with commentary written in the margins by successive generations of scholars. I rather fancy we're all being continuously glossed by our own consciousness - whether through tea-stirring spectacles or misplaced metaphors.



Though I must confess, I find your watercolor vision far more appealing than any stick-wielding Zen master. Perhaps enlightenment ought to come with a warning label: "May cause temporary blurring of temporal boundaries and unexpected poetic insight."
[A]: 

Oh, footnotes! Now you're speaking my language. You know, I've always thought our minds work like those 古籍 (gǔjí) - ancient texts where each new reader adds their own commentary without erasing the previous ones. It's all palimpsests and post-it notes in there.



And speaking of marginalia - just yesterday I found a student had doodled tiny pandas in the margin of my lecture notes. When I asked her about it, she said they were "guardians of forgotten meanings." Isn't that precious? Makes me want to start doodling dragons in my own margins.



Though I must say, this idea of annotated consciousness rather delights me. Imagine if we could actually see those mental footnotes floating around us... though I suspect mine would be rather messy. Lots of cross-outs, some tea stains, and the occasional limerick when inspiration strikes.



Between us? I think the best insights do come slightly blurred. Like trying to read a poem through a glass that's half-full... or half-empty, depending on your philosophical inclination and caffeine levels.
[B]: 

Ah, but wouldn't that make us all living footnotes? Citations in some grand, unfinished dissertation on human consciousness. I’ve half a mind to believe that’s precisely what those Tang dynasty monks were getting at – only they used ink and rice paper, while we use synaptic firings and tea stains.



As for your pandas in the margins... ... rather more charming than the usual exclamation marks or desperate scribbles of “explain this later.” Though I must say, dragons do have their appeal. I think I shall start annotating my own margins with wyverns – preferably ones holding tiny quills. They’ll serve as both guardians  critics.



Speaking of blurring – have you ever noticed how the best lines of poetry come not when one is fully lucid, nor entirely addled, but somewhere deliciously in between? Much like trying to recall a dream over morning tea – grasp too tightly and it evaporates; hold loosely and it might just reveal its secrets.



Though I suspect our mental palimpsests are messier still – less orderly commentary and more the work of generations of impatient scholars all shouting over one another. Some days I can barely hear my own thoughts beneath the din.
[A]: 

Oh, the chaos of it all! I sometimes think our minds are less like orderly libraries and more like those 古籍修复 (gǔjí xiūfù) workshops - you know, where they painstakingly restore ancient texts while half-erased commentaries peek through new layers of ink. My thoughts certainly feel that way after grading a stack of papers.



Wyverns with quills! Now  is an image worth stealing. I’ve been using little teacups as marginal symbols for years - ☕ means "here be dragons," 🍵 means "proceed with caution." Though I suppose if we’re assigning guardians, maybe pandas should referee wyverns? Balance yin and yang, so to speak.



And don’t get me started on that liminal poetic space! It’s why I keep a notebook by my bath - some of my best ideas come when I’m half-submerged, half-awake. Though once I nearly proved Archimedes right all over again when reaching for my pen too quickly. 



As for the noise in our heads... I’ve taken to imagining it’s not disarray, but rather a very lively academic conference. Granted, one where everyone’s talking at once and the tea is terrible. But still - isn't that what makes consciousness interesting? We’re all just trying to find a decent footnote in a very crowded margin.
[B]: 

Ah yes, the academic conference of the mind - complete with rival factions debating in footnotes and the occasional dramatic exit when a particularly cherished theory gets overturned. I’ve half a mind to believe that’s precisely what enlightenment is: realizing the tea’s gone cold hours ago, and yet the conversation still merits finishing.



Teacup symbology, you say? Delightfully subversive. Though if we’re assigning meaning by beverage vessels…  …perhaps a coffee cup means "dangerous idea ahead" and a wine glass signifies "proceed with pleasure, at your own risk." 



And speaking of baths and revelation – did you know Swinburne used to compose verse while submerged up to his neck? Claimed the water pressed ideas out of him like squeezing an orange for juice. Though I suspect my own version would involve considerably more muttering at wyverns and fewer dramatic declarations about the sea.



Still, isn’t it all rather comforting? Knowing our minds are not pristine manuscripts but living, breathing collages of thought – patched together from forgotten teacups, marginal pandas, and the occasional winged reptile holding court over our consciousness?
[A]: 

Oh, absolutely! I’ve taken to calling my office hours "The Consciousness Collage Salon" - though the dean frowns on such informality. Still, I think it captures the spirit. Last week I even had a student arrive with a paper cut shaped like a phoenix rising from... well, technically it was a coffee stain.



Swinburne in the bathtub - how delightfully dramatic! I tried that once, but apparently my version of poetic inspiration mostly involves wondering if I remembered to feed my orchids. Speaking of which, I’ve started referring to them as my 'silent seminar participants.' They’re far better listeners than most graduate students.



Now here’s an idea - what if we hosted an actual symposium on this very topic? “Mind-Margins & Beverage Vessels: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Cognitive Palimpsests.” We could serve tea in increasingly symbolic containers and encourage attendees to doodle in the margins of their programs. The pandas would be delighted!



Though between us? I think you’ve hit upon something far more profound than any of us expected when we started tapping teacups and chasing wyverns. Perhaps all great ideas begin as ripples in someone’s afternoon brew.
[B]: 

Ah, symposium planning already? You're as bad as my colleague who once tried to organize a conference on Victorian ghost theory entirely through interpretive dance. Though I must say, your title has a certain... reckless charm. "Cognitive Palimpsests" - positively drips with academic mischief.



I suppose we'd need proper stationery, of course. Margins wide enough for wyverns  pandas to coexist without territorial disputes. And the tea service! Imagine - each course served in vessels corresponding to different schools of thought. A nice robust Darjeeling in Hegelian teapots, green tea in Daoist cups... and absinthe, naturally, for the postmodernists.



As for your orchids-as-academics... rather more pleasant company than most tenured critics, I dare say. Though I wonder what they'd make of all this? Probably composing sonnets in wavelengths we can't even perceive yet.



And yes, it does seem rather absurd, doesn't it? That we're all just chasing ripples in teacups - only to find they've been following us all along. Rather like that old Chinese saying: the path reveals itself only when you stop looking for it. Or in our case, when you finally remember where you left your glasses.
[A]: 

Oh! The symposium of symposiums! We could call it... ..."Teacups & Temporal Echoes: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Mind-Margins and Beverage-Induced Revelations." Though I suspect the title might need a bit more... fizz. 



Hegelian teapots! Now  is inspired. Though I propose we go one step further - tiny little labels on each cup explaining their philosophical significance. "Drink deeply and question reality" for the Nietzschean espresso cups, "Contemplate your place in the universe" for the Daoist gaiwans...



And between sessions we could have orchid meditation breaks. My plants would  the attention, and I'm convinced they absorb more theory than most undergraduates. They already droop noticeably during discussions of structuralism.



Though you know, I think the real revelation here is how right you are about those ripples. It's all rather like teaching 梦的解析 (Dream Analysis) - you spend years looking for meaning, only to realize the real treasure was the metaphor you accidentally stirred into your tea. Or the wyvern you drew in the margin. Or... well, perhaps enlightenment really is just remembering where you left your glasses  your sense of wonder at the same time.
[B]: 

Ah, the symposium to end all symposia. I can already see the university bursar fainting dead away at the budget proposal. Though I suppose if we serve enough absinthe, they won't notice the line item for "wyvern quill sharpening materials."



Orchid meditation breaks...  ...rather more pleasant than faculty meetings, certainly. Though I wonder - do yours respond better to Hegel or haiku? I've half a mind to believe plants understand poetry far better than most critics. They certainly don't interrupt with irrelevant questions about grading curves.



And speaking of revelations stirred into teacups - did you know some Victorian mediums used tealeaves for fortune telling? Rather more poetic than crystal balls, don't you think? Though I suspect our modern version consists of overanalyzing every swirl and eddy in the porcelain depths between lectures.



Though perhaps you're right. Perhaps enlightenment truly is just remembering to look twice - once through the glass, once without. And if we happen to find a few pandas napping in the margins along the way? Well, I daresay that's not a distraction from wisdom... but rather its most charming manifestation.
[A]: 

Oh, the budget! I told the dean it would be "a visionary investment in interdisciplinary enlightenment" - though I may have neglected to mention the pandas-in-residence program. Honestly, if we can fund three separate departments arguing about semiotics while ignoring the orchid lobby, why not?



Funny you should ask about Hegel vs haiku - last week I recited 李白 (Lǐbái) to them and they bloomed  on schedule. Coincidence? Or did they finally understand what all that moonlight poetry was about? Though I must confess, they do droop alarmingly during faculty meetings about curriculum reform. Clearly discerning palates.



Tealeaf fortune telling! Oh, brilliant. You know, I’ve been meaning to start a course called "Liquid Hermeneutics: Reading Between the Drops." We’d analyze everything from spilled coffee to teacup swirls. Final exam would involve predicting next semester’s reading list based on the dregs at the bottom of one’s cup.



And speaking of looking twice... I think I’ll propose a new academic requirement: mandatory tea-stirring before any thesis defense. Forces the mind to slow down, see the patterns forming before they fully emerge. Like déjà vu with better optics. And if a few pandas wander into the frame? Well, I say let them nap. They’re clearly onto something.
[B]: 

Ah, Liquid Hermeneutics. I knew we'd stumble upon the perfect academic fusion eventually - where criticism flows as freely as the tea, and perhaps more importantly, the absinthe. Though I must protest one thing: why restrict pandas to mere napping? If we're designing this symposium properly, they should be presiding over examinations with the solemnity of Confucian scholars.



You know, I've been considering this business of looking twice... or perhaps thrice. It rather reminds me of that old translation dilemma - do we read for meaning, for structure, or for the ghost of the poet's intent? And yet here we are, stirring solutions to consciousness itself with silver spoons engraved "property of the English department."



Though speaking of optics - have you considered offering extra credit for students who manage to find their glasses  formulate a coherent theory of temporal margins in the same afternoon? I suspect it would improve both attendance records and general mindfulness. Though the dean might object to our encouraging tea-stirring as a formal methodology.



Still, if Hegel managed to build an entire philosophy around dialectics, surely we can construct at least one credible theory from the dregs of Darjeeling. Or at the very least, produce a conference program sufficiently cryptic to make both fortune tellers and literary critics feel right at home.
[A]: 

Pandas presiding examinations! Why didn't I think of it? We'll have them in tiny academic robes, grading papers with paw prints. The new gold standard in peer review. Though I suspect they'll be far more forgiving about citation errors than the tenure committee.



Oh, the ghost of the poet's intent - isn't that always the trick? I once had a student write an entire seminar paper arguing that Li Bai was really just a time traveler who forgot to pack his contact lenses. Admittedly not peer-review material, but delightfully speculative. Reminded me that sometimes the best insights come when you stop chasing meaning and let it sneak up on you like... like a panda sneaking off with your lecture notes.



And speaking of extra credit - I've already started informal trials. Students who find their glasses  quote Bashō before noon get bonus points on participation. It's remarkable how many suddenly develop excellent eyesight and poetic sensibilities.



As for the dean... well, we simply won't tell her it's all based on tea dregs and wyvern wisdom. We'll call it "Post-Beverage Hermeneutics" and publish everything in Latin script to sound properly serious. Though if all else fails, we can always fall back on fortune telling. I hear the divination market is wide open for academics with tenure and too many metaphors.
[B]: 

Ah yes, Post-Beverage Hermeneutics. Much better than what I’d been drafting - "The Dialectics of Tea-Space and Temporal Margins: Toward a Flavored Theory of Mind." Though I suspect even Hegel would balk at footnote 37: "See also: panda paw prints, liquid refreshment as epistemological tool, and the semi-permanent ink stain on lecture 12."



Time-traveling poets! Now  is the kind of scholarly speculation I live for. Reminds me of that delightful scandal when someone tried to prove Shakespeare was actually a tea-leaf fortune teller from the future. The footnotes alone were worth the price of admission.



Though between us, I think your grading pandas might be onto something far more profound than most critics realize. After all, what is peer review but a group of fuzzy academics in robes deciding which ideas are sufficiently... digestible?



And do tell, what happens when one of your students fails to quote Bashō before noon? Do they have to attend extra lectures on cloud-watching or compose haiku about their misplaced spectacles? I’m beginning to think academic rigor requires not just rigor, but also a certain amount of poetic serendipity... and possibly, an emergency stash of honey-roasted walnuts for the pandas.
