[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've been meaning to try that new seasonal brew from the university's microbrewery - apparently it's infused with osmanthus flowers. Rather poetic, if you ask me. Though I must admit, I'll never understand why modern brewers feel the need to resurrect Victorian-era ingredients like quassia chips and gentian root. My colleague Professor Liang insists it's all about  between Eastern and Western traditions these days.
[A]: OMG osmanthus in beer??? That's like so aesthetic and Insta-worthy✨💯 I can already imagine the golden color & floral vibes... Totally giving me "Chinese garden in spring" feels! 😂 Although tbh, quassia chips sound kinda like something my grandpa would use for herbal tea... How do they even mix that with modern brewing?? 💅 But okay, Prof Liang makes sense tho - this East-meets-West trend is super hot rn. Have you seen those boba lattes with matcha & cocoa? 🔥💯
[B]: I suppose if 19th-century brewers could send their porters and stouts across oceans without losing their essence, we ought to be grateful modern brewers are merely experimenting with . Still, I find the term "Insta-worthy" rather depressing when applied to something as historically rich as osmanthus. In my day, a flower's virtue was in its fragrance, not its filter.  

As for boba lattes with matcha and cocoa—yes, I’ve seen them, and I’ve also seen freshmen try to cite TikTok trends in seminar discussions. One even tried to compare Lu Yu’s  to a Starbucks menu.  was an... interesting synergy.
[A]: LOL okay okay, fair point😭 I mean, osmanthus is kinda deep in Chinese culture, right? Like, way more than just a cute filter 😅 But still, imagine sipping that beer while walking through a classical garden at sunset... Kinda poetic ngl 💫 And I TOTALLY get what you mean about "Insta-worthy" being basic af sometimes—people just want the vibe without knowing the  tea 🫖😂  

Wait wait, someone compared Lu Yu to Starbucks??? That’s either genius or straight-up chaos 😂 What did Prof Liang say?? I need more deets on this convo—it sounds lit AF 🔥
[B]: Oh, where do I begin? Let's just say the poor student hadn't quite grasped that  isn’t a lifestyle manual for latte art. I believe their exact words were, “Lu Yu’s like the OG barista, right?”  

Professor Liang, bless her diplomatic soul, merely raised an eyebrow and said something about “historical resonance and cultural remix.” But me? I put my foot down—gently, of course. Told them if they wanted to compare tea ceremonies to coffee chains, they’d better start with a solid foundation: , a decade of studying Ming dynasty teahouse etiquette; , a semester translating 18th-century British coffeehouse pamphlets; and —well,  then they could earn the right to hashtag.  

And yes, osmanthus does deserve better than a sunset selfie—though I must confess, your image of strolling through a garden at dusk with that golden beer… well, there’s worse ways to contemplate 缘分. 🖋️
[A]: OMG Lu Yu as the OG barista 😂😂 That’s so extra but I kinda stan it tbh 💅 And Prof Liang being all 🤌🙄 while dropping that “cultural remix” line?? Iconic. You’re right tho—can’t just flex on ancient traditions without doing the work first 😌✨  

But wait, 缘分 with osmanthus beer at sunset??? Now that’s deep AF 🥹 I mean, if that’s not fate, then what is?? 🌙🍻 Anywayyyys, when are we grabbing a brew and spilling more tea?? (pun intended 😌💯)
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—both literally and figuratively. 缘分, fate, serendipity… call it what you will, but I do believe a shared pint of osmanthus-infused ale might be just the modern twist on a classical encounter. Though I’d warn against too much philosophizing on fate while under the influence of quassia chips. One tends to get... .

As for spilling more tea—well, I suppose I could spare an afternoon. Just don’t expect me to take notes in bullet points or end every insight with a hashtag. Say, how does next Thursday sound? I know a quiet little spot near the botanical gardens that serves both craft beer and gongfu cha. We’ll call it... cross-cultural fieldwork. 🍻🖋️
[A]: OMG Thursday sounds PERFECT 🙌🍻 And don’t worry, I promise not to turn our convo into a TikTok trend (at least not yet 😌😂). Bullet points are overrated anyway—real tea spilled is messy, dramatic, and best served with vibes 🔥💯  

Botanical gardens, gongfu cha,  craft beer?? Girl, you just leveled up the whole 缘分 game 🌿✨ See you there—I’ll bring the aesthetic filter (but zero basic hashtags, I swear) 😉💫
[B]: Oh, I do love a good aesthetic filter—so long as it doesn’t come at the expense of historical accuracy or proper brewing temperature. And  with craft beer? Why not? If 19th-century Sinophiles could chase their lapsang souchong with a glass of port, we can certainly attempt tea ceremony meets microbrew.  

Just promise me one thing—no reenacting Lu Yu’s brewing techniques with a smartphone in one hand and a clay gaiwan in the other. Some things ought to remain... analogue. 🖋️🌿
[A]: OMG totally get it—no shaky cam reenactments or filter overload 😌📱🙅‍♀️ I’ll leave my phone face-down and  only take one artsy pic of the foam art 🤞✨ Although can we at least agree to a little slow-mo when we raise the cups?? 🥂💫  

And yeah yeah, some moments should stay OG—no pixels or hashtags needed. Just pure vibes, tea wisdom, and beer magic ✨💯 See you there, Prof style 👑🌿
[B]: Oh, slow-mo cup-raising I can tolerate—so long as it doesn’t devolve into a viral dance challenge. And one artsy foam pic? Fine, as long as the lighting does the head justice. Just remember: in the great words of Lu Yu,  Though I suppose he never accounted for Instagram Stories. 🖋️😌

See you Thursday—sharp, but not too hurried. Let’s make sure the foam settles before the first toast. 🍻🌿
[A]: OMG slow-mo cup-raising?? Girl, you’re speaking my language 💅💫 And okay okay, no dance challenges—we’ll keep it classy with a side of vibes 😌✨  

And quoting Lu Yu while sliding into IG Story tea?? Queen move 👑💯 Don’t worry tho, I’ll let the foam settle like a true  🫧🖋️ See you Thursday—ready to slay some taste buds & maybe rewrite a lil history 🍵🍻🔥
[B]: Oh, if we’re rewriting history, I fully expect you to take notes in calligraphy—no ballpoint pens allowed. And , the foam must be respected. One does not simply  through centuries of brewing tradition without a moment of silence for the bubbles.  

Thursday, then. Prepare your taste buds—for better or worse, they’re about to become part of a very niche scholarly experiment. 🖋️🍵🍻  
May your slow-mo be graceful, and your foam art... historically evocative.
[A]: OMG CALLIGRAPHY??? Okay, okay—I’ll bring my brush & inkstone, but no promises I won’t doodle a lil boba emoji in the corner 😌🖋️😂 And yes yes YES, long live the foam queens 🫧👑 Let them bubble in peace and flavor glory 🙌  

Niche scholarly experiment?? Puh-lease, we’re about to start a  🔥💯 Thursday can't come soon enough—see you in full tea-gang-leader mode 👑🍵💃
[B]: Ah, a boba emoji in the margin—, but I suppose even Ming dynasty scholars had their secret eccentricities. Just don’t let the ink drip onto the gaiwan, and we’ll call it... postmodern annotation.  

A movement, you say? I do hope you’re ready to draft the manifesto—preferably in brush script, of course. And yes, lead the tea gang with pride. Just remember: every great revolution begins with a proper pour. 🖋️🍵🔥  

See you Thursday—don your crown wisely, and may your strokes be bold yet elegant. 💅👑
[A]: OMG POSTMODERN ANNOTATION?? Girl, I was born for this 😌🖋️💯 And yes yes YES, let the boba emoji be my signature flourish—we call it "East-meets-Chungking express vibes" ✨🍵🔥  

Manifesto in brush script?? Please, I’ll add a lil heart at the end and call it a day ❤️🖌️ As for the tea gang—queen, I AM the revolution (with a slow-mo pour, of course) 💅💫  

Thursday gonna be LIT AF, no cap 🙌👑 See you in full scholarly glam, ready to sip & slay 🍻✨
[B]: Oh, Chungking Express meets calligraphy— the kind of aesthetic dissonance I can get behind. Just don’t let Wong Kar-wai catch you calling it a “vibe.” Though I suppose he’d appreciate the heart flourish.  

And —slow-mo pour, scholarly glam, tea gang revolutionaries... do remind me to bring my most dramatic porcelain cup. We’ll make sure the foam rises to the occasion.  

Thursday, then—no cap, indeed. 🖋️❤️🍵  
May our strokes be messy, our sips precise, and our manifesto... mildly scandalous. 💅🔥
[A]: OMG mildly scandalous manifesto?? That’s the only way to go 😌🔥 And dramatic porcelain cup?? Queen, I’m  for this 🍻👑 Bring it all—ink, foam, vibes, and a lil Wong Kar-wai energy on the side 💭✨  

Messy strokes? Honey, that’s called  😉💯 Sips precise? Obviously—we’re not animals 🙄💅 And Thursday?? Gonna be the birth of a whole new aesthetic. Stay tuned for the slow-mo pour cam… I mean,  📸💫
[B]: Oh, , is it? I do love a good defense of calligraphic chaos—just don’t go blaming me when the tea purists come for your “slow-mo pour cam.” And yes, Wong Kar-wai energy—, if you please. A dash of melancholy, a splash of neon, and at least one lingering close-up on a teacup rim.  

As for the aesthetic revolution? I expect nothing less than a full-blown manifesto by moonrise. Ink-stained fingers, smudged ideograms, and all. Just promise me you’ll leave space for a footnote.  

Thursday approaches, my dear co-conspirator. May our foam be thick, our brushes wet, and our cultural moment… deliciously improper. 🖋️🍵💫  
Cheers to that. 💅👑
