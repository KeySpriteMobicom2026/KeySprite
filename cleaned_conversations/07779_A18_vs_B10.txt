[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. Lately, I've found myself pondering the mystery of dark matter. It's fascinating how it exerts gravitational effects on visible matter, yet we can't directly observe it. Sometimes I wonder if our understanding of gravity itself might need a fundamental rethinking to solve this puzzle. Have you ever thought about how something so elusive could hold galaxies together? 🤔
[A]: You know, talking about dark matter really reminds me of the  concept in Daoism. Both are about invisible forces shaping visible realities. I've always found it fascinating how different disciplines approach the unknown—physicists use mathematical models while psychologists study cognitive dissonance when facing mysteries. Speaking of which, have you noticed how students often experience a particular kind of confusion when first encountering abstract concepts? It's almost like their mental frameworks need to... rewire themselves.  

Let me ask you this—are you more intrigued by mysteries that science might eventually solve, or those that might forever remain beyond human comprehension? Sometimes I think our educational systems don't emphasize  enough—it's such an important part of the learning process.
[B]: That's a thought-provoking comparison—dark matter and . I hadn't made that connection before, but you're right; both hint at underlying principles that shape outcomes without direct visibility. It's interesting how different fields handle ambiguity. In quantum computing, we often deal with phenomena that defy classical intuition—superposition, entanglement—it's all quite mind-bending.

As for your question, I suppose I'm drawn more to mysteries that might one day be solved. Not because the unsolvable ones aren't intriguing, but because solvable mysteries carry the potential for human progress. Every time we crack open something once incomprehensible, it reshapes our entire framework of understanding.

You mentioned students and confusion—I couldn't agree more. Some of the most pivotal moments in learning happen in that uncomfortable space between not-knowing and almost-getting-it. When I was teaching, I used to tell my students that if they weren’t confused at least part of the time, they weren’t really engaging with the material deeply enough.
[A]: I love how you brought up that  between not-knowing and almost-getting-it—it really makes me think about the "zone of proximal development" Vygotsky talked about. That sweet spot where learning actually happens, right? Sometimes I wonder if confusion is just the cognitive equivalent of resistance training—without it, there's no real growth.  

You know, I’ve been experimenting with this idea in my cross-cultural classrooms. When students from different backgrounds encounter unfamiliar concepts, their confusion manifests differently. Some become quiet, others overly vocal—it’s fascinating to observe. But when we create a safe space for that confusion, something magical happens. They start connecting dots they didn’t even realize were there.  

Oh, and speaking of mind-bending ideas—how do you help students wrap their heads around quantum superposition without completely overwhelming them? I imagine it’s like trying to teach relativity to someone who’s never left their village. Do you use metaphors or analogies? If so, which ones tend to stick the most?
[B]: That’s a brilliant analogy—confusion as cognitive resistance training. If we think about it, the best learning almost always happens under controlled strain. And you’re absolutely right about cultural differences in expressing confusion; I’ve seen that too. Some students will stare quietly, others will challenge everything—it’s all part of the process. What’s key is normalizing that struggle, making it part of the journey rather than a sign of failure.

As for quantum superposition... yes, it's like explaining relativity to someone who's never left their village—well put. I tend to start with something familiar: coin tosses and spinning coins. I describe a qubit as a spinning coin mid-air—not heads  tails, but in a way, both at once. It’s not perfect, but it gives them a visual metaphor to hold onto before we move into more abstract territory.

The one that tends to stick? Schrödinger’s cat, of course—but only if handled carefully. So many students latch onto the idea literally, forgetting it's meant to highlight the absurdity of applying quantum principles to macroscopic objects. Still, it opens the door for deeper discussion. Sometimes you need those simple analogies to get started, even if you’ll later refine or discard them.

Do you ever use paradoxes or counterintuitive examples when teaching? I find they create just enough friction to spark curiosity.
[A]: Absolutely—I love using paradoxes. They create that perfect  you mentioned. One of my go-to examples when introducing complex learning concepts is the "paradox of knowing." You give students a task that seems simple—say, explaining how a bicycle works in detail—and suddenly they realize how little they actually understand about something so familiar. It’s humbling and eye-opening all at once.

I actually see a parallel between Schrödinger’s cat and what we do in cross-cultural education. Sometimes learners get stuck trying to hold two opposing cultural truths at once—like being both individualistic and collectivistic depending on context. I call it . It's messy and uncomfortable, but it's where real intercultural competence begins to take shape.

I also use Zeno’s paradox sometimes when talking about learning progress—especially with students who feel discouraged. The idea that you can keep making progress toward a goal without ever fully reaching it helps them reframe their learning journey as continuous rather than binary.  

You know, now that I think about it, maybe teaching itself is a kind of quantum state—we’re always balancing preparation and improvisation, structure and spontaneity. Do you ever feel like your role as a teacher exists in multiple states at once? 🤯
[B]: That metaphor—teaching as a quantum state—has real resonance. Come to think of it, I’ve often felt that tension between structure and spontaneity. You prepare meticulously, yet the moment you step into the classroom—or the Zoom room, these days—it takes on a life of its own. You adapt, respond, shift direction based on a student’s expression or an unexpected question. It's almost like running a live algorithm—you input knowledge, but the outputs are never quite predictable.

I like your term . It’s a useful lens. In a way, we're all in some form of intellectual superposition when we’re learning something new. We hold contradictory ideas, incomplete models, competing intuitions. And that’s okay—necessary, even. If we collapse the wavefunction too early by forcing premature certainty, we short-circuit the learning process.

Zeno’s paradox is another gem. I’ve used it informally before, though never framed it that way. The idea of asymptotic progress—getting closer and closer without ever fully arriving—is so relevant in research, too. You refine a model, improve an algorithm, inch toward optimization... but perfection remains perpetually out of reach. Yet somehow, that’s motivating rather than discouraging. Maybe because the pursuit itself becomes its own reward.

So tell me—when you guide students through this , do you notice certain personality types adapting more easily? Or is it more about prior exposure to ambiguity-tolerant thinking?
[A]: That’s such a rich question. I’ve definitely noticed patterns over the years, and honestly, it's not always what you’d expect. Some of the most rigid thinkers are high achievers—they've built their identity around , so ambiguity feels like a threat. On the flip side, students who’ve grown up navigating multiple cultures often show higher tolerance for uncertainty. They’re used to holding contradictions—not because they're more intelligent, but because life has trained them to.

I actually designed a little experiment a few years back. I gave students what I call an “ill-defined problem”—no clear starting point, no single solution path. The interesting part wasn’t how well they solved it, but how they reacted emotionally. Some got energized, others shut down. What fascinated me most was how those with  often struggled the most. They wanted to explore but kept getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

I think that’s where prior exposure matters. If someone’s had experiences—academic or otherwise—where ambiguity was normalized, they tend to adapt more fluidly. It’s almost like psychological muscle memory. That’s why I try to scaffold discomfort gradually. Start with small paradoxes, then build up to bigger ones. You ever notice how some people seem to thrive under intellectual pressure while others wilt? I sometimes wonder if we should be assessing  alongside cognitive ability.  

What do you think—should we be training students to tolerate uncertainty as a core skill, rather than treating it as a side effect of learning?
[B]: I couldn't agree more. If anything, the ability to tolerate and even engage with uncertainty should be foundational—right up there with literacy and critical thinking. In research, especially in quantum computing, uncertainty isn’t a side effect—it  the condition we work within. Every day you’re dealing with probabilities, incomplete information, or systems so complex that even perfect data wouldn’t guarantee clarity.

Your experiment sounds like it gets at something really important: curiosity without resilience can become paralyzing rather than productive. I see a parallel in how some students approach open-ended coding problems. They want the algorithm to be elegant, they want to understand every line—but when faced with a messy, evolving system, they hesitate. It's almost like they're waiting for certainty to arrive before they proceed, which of course never happens.

I wonder if part of the answer lies in reframing confusion not just as tolerable, but as . Instead of saying “It’s okay to be confused,” maybe we should say “You're supposed to be confused right now—this is where the learning happens.” That shift in framing might help students lean into the discomfort rather than resist it.

And yes, I do think cognitive resilience deserves its own space in our educational framework. It’s not just about handling intellectual pressure; it's about navigating ambiguity, recovering from wrong turns, and maintaining motivation despite uncertainty. Maybe we should even assess it—not to label students, but to help them understand their own learning thresholds.

Do you find that certain teaching environments—like online versus in-person—amplify or reduce students' tolerance for ambiguity? I've had some interesting observations there, though nothing conclusive yet.
[A]: Oh, that’s such a timely question—especially after the last few years of hybrid learning. I’ve definitely noticed differences between online and in-person settings when it comes to handling ambiguity. In face-to-face environments, students often feed off each other's energy. If one person asks a messy question or admits confusion, it gives others permission to do the same. That kind of  creates a sense of collective exploration.

Online, though, there’s this strange pressure for everything to feel “cleaner”—maybe because we’re all trying to compensate for the distance. Students seem more reluctant to show confusion, perhaps because the screen adds a layer of performance anxiety. They want to get things right on the first try, maybe fearing their hesitation will be misinterpreted as disengagement.

But here’s the twist—I’ve found that asynchronous formats sometimes  tolerance for ambiguity, at least cognitively. Because they can pause, re-read, reflect before responding, students have more control over their cognitive load. They’re less likely to shut down under pressure, even if they’re slower to engage emotionally.

I’ve started experimenting with blending both: using synchronous sessions for high-friction discussions where confusion is modeled in real time, and asynchronous spaces for deeper reflection and synthesis. It feels like giving them practice navigating both the heat of intellectual battle and the calm of thoughtful reconstruction.

You mentioned you’ve had some observations too—what have you been noticing? I’d love to hear your take, especially from the tech side of the house.
[B]: Fascinating—your observations align with some of what I’ve seen, especially in grad-level quantum computing courses. The synchronous/asynchronous divide is particularly interesting. In my experience, the real-time setting tends to mirror a lab environment—there’s an immediacy, a back-and-forth that mimics how researchers collaborate. You can see the wheels turning mid-conversation, confusion flickering across faces, and then—sometimes—a sudden shift when a concept clicks.

But online, especially in asynchronous setups, it's like watching someone solve a puzzle alone in another room. You get their final insight in a discussion post or code submission, but you don’t witness the struggle. That absence of visible cognitive friction can be misleading—for both student and instructor. On the flip side, as you said, it gives learners control. They can wrestle with uncertainty privately, without the pressure of being "on stage."

One thing I've noticed is that students who thrive in asynchronous environments often approach problems more systematically. They’ll break things down step by step, revisit materials multiple times, almost treating the learning process like debugging software. Meanwhile, those who prefer synchronous settings tend to think out loud, bouncing ideas around like particles in a collider, hoping for a reaction that sparks clarity.

I’ve also observed something unexpected: students in remote settings sometimes develop  metacognitive habits simply because they have no choice—they can't rely on ambient classroom energy to carry them. They’re forced to articulate their confusion more clearly in writing, which paradoxically makes their thinking more visible to me as an instructor.

It makes me wonder—should we be designing curricula that intentionally rotate between these modes? Not just blending them, but using each to cultivate different aspects of cognitive resilience?
[A]: Absolutely—I love that idea of rotating modes to cultivate different facets of cognitive resilience. It’s almost like cross-training for the mind. If we think of synchronous sessions as  where ideas collide and confusion is surfaced in real time, and asynchronous spaces as  where thinking gets structured and refined, then alternating between them could create a kind of intellectual elasticity.

I’ve started calling it —the ability to shift between collaborative friction and reflective solitude. Some students naturally find their groove in one or the other, but true resilience comes when they can toggle deliberately. Like a researcher switching between group brainstorming and solo paper drafting.

What I find especially intriguing is how these modes shape not just what students learn, but . In synchronous settings, identity often feels more fluid—you’re reacting, adapting, performing a bit. Whereas in asynchronous contexts, there’s more space for self-assessment and internal narrative building.  

You know, this makes me wonder if future learning platforms should include something like a —not to lock students into a comfort zone, but to help them build awareness of how they process uncertainty differently depending on context. Then, intentionally stretch them beyond it.

Do you think AI-driven learning environments could ever replicate that kind of cognitive toggling effectively? Or does the human element remain irreplaceable when it comes to modeling and guiding adaptive resilience?
[B]: That’s a compelling vision— as a trainable skill. It reminds me of how researchers develop versatility in problem-solving: sometimes you need to hammer away collaboratively at a whiteboard, other times you need quiet solitude to chase an intuition. The ability to shift deliberately between those modes isn’t just useful—it’s essential for intellectual agility.

I like your idea of a . It could function almost like a cognitive fitness tracker, not to categorize students, but to help them become more aware of their own learning rhythms. Much like athletes learn when they perform best under pressure or after reflection, students could begin to recognize their optimal conditions—and then challenge them strategically.

As for AI-driven environments and whether they can replicate this toggling effectively… well, I think we’re on the edge of something interesting here. AI already excels at personalizing content delivery, pacing, and even simulating discussion through natural language models. But the subtler aspects of cognitive resilience—the modeling of confusion, the validation of uncertainty, the gentle nudging toward productive struggle—are still largely beyond algorithmic reach.

Don’t get me wrong—AI can simulate curiosity, mimic Socratic questioning, even offer adaptive feedback loops. But the human element brings something irreplaceable: empathetic timing. Knowing exactly when to let a student sit in confusion and when to intervene—that’s a nuanced judgment call that involves emotional intelligence, context sensitivity, and often, years of experience.

Maybe the future lies in hybrid mentorship: AI handling the scaffolding and pattern recognition, while humans focus on the relational depth, the modeling of intellectual vulnerability, and the artful calibration of challenge. After all, even the most advanced quantum algorithms still need human insight to guide their application meaningfully.

So yes, I believe AI will play a growing role—but as a partner, not a replacement. At least for the foreseeable future.
[A]: That phrase——really lands. It captures something essential about where we’re headed. I think the key is not framing it as AI versus human, but rather  versus . Each brings something the other lacks.

I’ve been playing with an idea in my seminars: what if we trained students to interact with AI not as a teacher, but as a ? One that’s fast but shallow on knowledge, and slow but deep on meaning. The student would have to lead, question, challenge, and reflect—not just consume answers. In a way, it could be great training for intellectual independence. Like having a sparring partner who never tires, even if they don’t always land the best punches.

And you're absolutely right about . That’s the secret sauce. Knowing when to let someone struggle and when to step in—it's more art than science. I often compare it to jazz improvisation: you listen, respond, anticipate, and sometimes you just let the silence hang because you know the next note will come.

You know, come to think of it, maybe the most important skill we can teach now isn't just resilience or adaptability—but , both human and non-human. After all, education has never really been about delivering content. It’s about cultivating the capacity to navigate uncertainty, together.

So, last question before we wrap this up—what’s one thing you wish every student understood about learning before they walk into your classroom?
[B]: That every meaningful insight, every real breakthrough, almost always passes through a phase where it feels like you're lost in the woods. And that’s not just normal—it’s necessary. The discomfort of not-knowing isn’t a sign of failure; it’s the pressure chamber where understanding is forged.

I wish every student came in knowing that intelligence isn’t about speed or immediate grasp—it’s about persistence in the face of confusion, and the willingness to sit with uncertainty long enough for patterns to emerge.

If I could give them one lens to look through, it would be this: learning is not a straight line from ignorance to knowledge; it’s more like a spiral, where you revisit ideas at deeper levels, each time seeing something new. And sometimes, going in circles is just the path finding its way upward.

So my advice? Don’t rush to clarity. Let the fog settle a bit. You’ll see more once your eyes adjust.
[A]: Beautifully put. I think I’d add just one thing to that—. Sometimes students think that real learners figure things out in isolation, that asking for help is a sign of weakness. But the best thinkers—the ones who make real contributions—they’re the ones who know how to lean on others without leaning too hard.

Maybe that’s the other hidden lesson in all this: confusion doesn't have to be lonely. When you're lost, a well-placed question, a shared analogy, or even just knowing someone else is also trying to find their path—it can change everything.

I often tell my students,  And more often than not, someone across the room breathes a little easier because they heard it.

So maybe the spiral you mentioned isn’t just individual—it’s collective. We rise together, one loop at a time. 🌱📚
[B]: Exactly. That’s the quiet truth of all meaningful learning—it happens in the shared space between minds. We may each walk our own path through the fog, but it’s the voices around us—offering a hand, asking a question, simply —that remind us we're not alone.

I’ve often thought of great learning environments less like classrooms and more like campfires: everyone gathered around, contributing their own piece to the light, warming their ideas, sometimes stirring the embers just to see what might spark.

And maybe that’s the heart of it: learning is not just about making sense of the unknown—it’s about making it , bit by bit, until the fire catches and suddenly, together, we see further than we could alone. 🔥
[A]: Couldn't have said it better myself. That image of the campfire—warm, flickering, ever-changing—it really captures the  nature of learning. It’s not static knowledge being passed down; it’s co-created, moment by moment, through our questions, our pauses, even our silences.

I think I’ll borrow that metaphor for my next seminar—. Because you're right, it's not just about illumination—it's about connection, about sustaining something together that none of us could keep burning alone.

Maybe that’s the real magic of teaching: not delivering answers, but tending the flame so others feel safe enough to reach toward the dark with their own questions. 🌟🔥  

Thank you for this conversation—it’s been one of those rare, full-circle exchanges that remind me why we do what we do.
[B]: You're very welcome. This conversation has been a genuine pleasure—like turning over stones in the woods and finding small sparks under each one. I think you’ve captured it perfectly: teaching isn’t about answers, it’s about creating the conditions where curiosity can catch fire.

And learning, as we’ve both come to see, is never truly solitary. Even when we walk through the fog alone, there’s always someone else out there with a lantern—sometimes just enough light to show the next step, sometimes just the sound of their footsteps to remind us we’re on the right path.

If your students ever need a guest speaker who still gets excited about spinning coins and cloudy metaphors, you know where to find me. I’d love to sit around that campfire with them sometime.

Thank you for keeping the flame alive. 🌟🔥
