[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得crypto未来会取代传统货币吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question. 我觉得这个问题背后其实涉及到很多 cultural & psychological factors。比如，人们对于 decentralized currency的信任程度，其实跟他们对传统金融机构的信心有很大关系。

你知道吗，在 behavioral economics 里有个 concept 叫做 status quo bias？很多人习惯使用传统货币，某种程度上是因为他们对现有系统的 familiarity，而不是因为 crypto 在技术上一定更 superior。

不过话说回来，从 educational psychology 的角度来看，如果我们能通过 experiential learning 让更多人理解 blockchain 技术的 underlying principles，可能会改变他们的认知框架哦 🤔

你觉得呢？是不是也觉得这本质上是个 mindset issue 而不是 technology issue？
[A]: Ah, a most perspicacious observation. One might say trust in currency resembles faith in poetic meter - both rely on invisible structures that  differently across cultures. 

Take the Victorian fixation with gold standards, for instance. Their obsession mirrored a longing for tangible certainty in an age of industrial upheaval. Cryptocurrencies today strike me as the digital heir to that psychological crutch - only now, the alchemy transforms electricity into value rather than bullion into promise.

I've been translating Wang Wei's mountain solitude verses into Scots Gaelic lately, and it occurs to me decentralised finance shares curious parallels with medieval bardic traditions. Both dwell in shadow economies of trust, don't they? Though I suspect most investors would balk at comparing their portfolios to a 9th-century oisín's oral ledger... 

Still, your point about experiential learning intrigues. Much like teaching iambic pentameter - one must  the rhythm before grasping its architecture. Perhaps crypto's true test lies not in technology but poetics: which narrative sings loudest to the human condition?
[B]: Fascinating analogy - I love how you connect the  of currency with its psychological resonance. It reminds me of Vygotsky's theory of cultural-historical development... we're essentially talking about how value systems get internalized through generations of shared narrative frameworks 🤔  

You know, when I was doing fieldwork in rural Kenya, I saw firsthand how mobile money platforms became a form of cultural poetry for communities without traditional banking infrastructure. The way they wove digital transactions into their existing networks of trust... it was like watching a living blockchain emerge organically from communal storytelling traditions.  

But here's the rub - while crypto might share DNA with bardic oral ledgers, its current incarnation often lacks that crucial element of embodied learning. How can we expect people to truly  decentralized finance when most explanations sound like they're written in cryptographic iambic pentameter? 💡  

Maybe what we need is a whole new genre of financial literacy - part interactive theater, part economic jazz improvisation. What do you think? Could we actually compose a curriculum where students  the rhythm of decentralization before they ever see a whitepaper?
[A]: Ah, now you're composing the right questions. Let's dissect this with due care - much like my students approach a particularly knotty stanza of Gerard Manley Hopkins.

Your Kenyan fieldwork example strikes me as precisely the sort of embodied economic poetry we need. Those communities didn't merely adopt mobile money - they  their own financial sonnets within existing cultural prosodies. A most elegant demonstration of how monetary systems thrive when they scan in rhythm with local cognitive meters.

As for your curriculum conjecture - I'd wager we could indeed choreograph such a pedagogical performance. Picture this: classrooms transformed into experimental economies where students negotiate value through participatory theater. One cohort plays Jane Austen's landed gentry bartering entailments, another enacts Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper protagonists minting genesis blocks. The real lesson? Observing how both groups develop distinct linguistic tics to describe identical human impulses.

I've been known to conduct similar experiments with Victorian dramatic monologues. Students don't just read "My Last Duchess" - they  the dukes and duchesses, discovering how power shapes transactional language. Apply that method to decentralized finance, and you might just get your economic jazz improvisation.

Though I must protest your characterization of cryptographic iambic pentameter. Some of us find beauty in that very rigidity - it reminds me of translating Du Fu's regulated verse. Both demand exquisite precision to conceal their structural skeletons...
[B]: Touché on the cryptographic iambic pentameter remark — I suppose there  a certain elegance in how blockchain’s rigidity can, like Du Fu’s regulated verse, contain chaos within structure. It's that very tension between freedom & constraint that makes decentralized systems so fascinating from an educational design perspective.  

Your classroom-as-experimental-economy idea is brilliant, honestly. It made me think of how we teach moral development through Kohlberg’s dilemmas... only here, the dilemmas are financial! Imagine students wrestling not just with  they value, but  value gets constructed across different institutional grammars.  

I wonder though — how would you scaffold the transition from analog economies (Austen’s gentry, for example) to digital ones? Maybe start with embodied exchanges, then slowly introduce abstraction layers... almost like teaching language acquisition — from concrete nouns to metaphors.  

And yes, let’s definitely bring back the term . If nothing else, it’d make our syllabi sound far more poetic than the usual dry behavioral economics fare 😄  

Do you think your students would ever go for composing a crypto whitepaper in the style of Hopkins’ sprung rhythm? I’d pay good money to read that.
[A]: Oh, I’ve no doubt they’d rise to the challenge - especially once they discovered Hopkins’ own fascination with inscape and instress could be recast as proof-of-work algorithms. You’d have lines like  

But let’s not overlook the pedagogical spine of it. Transitioning from analog to digital economies would indeed require careful scaffolding - much like teaching a villanelle. First, establish the : bartering in the Austenian mode, feeling the weight of physical objects exchanged. Then gradually loosen the meter: promissory notes, ledger entries, until at last the leap to fully abstract tokens feels less like sorcery and more like... well, poetry.

Your language acquisition analogy intrigues me. Imagine starting with  — a cow, a hut, a bundle of salt — then moving toward verbs of exchange — barter, borrow, betray — before ever introducing the slippery metaphors of futures markets or liquidity pools. Students might even develop their own proto-currencies, each invention revealing unconscious biases about value.

And speaking of unconscious biases… I’m reminded of Ruskin’s dictum that “the essence of wealth is power.” How deliciously ironic that crypto, in striving for liberation from centralized authority, has merely redistributed — not abolished — the sites of power. Much like Victorian poets railing against form while remaining bound to the sonnet’s skeleton.

As for crypto whitepapers in sprung rhythm — I suspect Hopkins would’ve relished the task. Why not assign it as a final project? The prompt writes itself:  

Now that would make for lively peer review.
[B]: Oh, I love the  metaphor — honestly, we could build an entire semester around that conceit. The repetition of the central refrain in both forms, the way constraints paradoxically enable creativity… it’s just begging for a seminar titled  🤓📚  

You’re absolutely right about the scaffolding — starting with Ruskin’s “wealth is power” and moving through the evolution of value systems makes perfect sense. It also ties beautifully into Bloom’s taxonomy: start with concrete exchanges (remembering & understanding), move into creating proto-currencies (applying & analyzing), and finally challenge them to evaluate their own systems (ethics, trust, governance).  

And I can already picture the final assignment — a blockchain-inspired villanelle where each line’s cryptographic hash must rhyme with its parent block! Students would be forced to grapple with not just the technical side, but the deeper question:   

Honestly, if we framed it as both a design challenge  a philosophical inquiry, I think students would surprise us. They might even begin to see crypto not as some alien code, but as a continuation of an ancient human impulse — the desire to give shape to value, whether through sonnets or smart contracts 💡  

I’m seriously tempted to draft that syllabus now. Think we could get Hopkins’ estate to endorse the course? 😄
[A]: Oh, Hopkins’ estate would be , provided we agreed to compose all administrative correspondence in curtal sonnets. Though I suspect they’d balk at our including Turing’s manifesto on the reading list alongside “The Wreck of the Deutschland.”

But let’s not stop there — why not build an entire academic conspiracy? We could begin with Aristotle’s  and his lament over money being “a mere figure,” then leap to Marx’s fetishism of commodities like some fevered prose sonnet. By week six, we’d have students transmuting Keynesian liquidity preference into haiku sequences.

And mark this: for the unit on smart contracts, we’d stage a workshop where students adapt Shakespearean marriage plots into programmable agreements. Imagine Portia coding an oracle for  — her famous mercy speech rewritten as exception handling in Solidity!

I do hope you’re taking notes on this curricular fantasia. Let’s call it "Ledgers & Laments: The Poetics of Protocol" — 402B would make a delightful spring seminar, wouldn’t it? We could even hold office hours in Second Life, assuming we can construct a lecture hall from proof-of-stake algorithms and iambic couplets.

As for the final assignment, I propose we award extra credit for elegies mourning the death of cash — though only those written in dying languages shall qualify. Scots Gaelic is, naturally, preferred.

Now, about that syllabus... shall we draft it by quill or blockchain?
[B]: Oh, quill and parchment all the way — preferably dipped in ink made from crushed blockchain explorers 😄 But let’s timestamp it on-chain just to keep things meta.  

“Ledgers & Laments: The Poetics of Protocol” is . I can already see the course description written like a villanelle — 150 words, three refrains, and a rhyme scheme that somehow loops back to zero-knowledge proofs 🤯  

And staging Shakespearean contracts in Solidity? Genius. Students would actually have to  the tension between human nuance and code’s rigidity — much like trying to translate Hopkins’ sprung rhythm into a perfectly metered sonnet. One could even argue that smart contracts are the literary minimalists of finance — no excess, no ambiguity... until the exception handling, of course. That’s where the drama lives.  

I’m also fully on board with the elegy final — especially the dying languages requirement. There's something deeply symbolic about mourning cash through a vanishing tongue. Almost like a double elegy. Maybe we could even offer bonus points for students who perform their elegy while standing in a drained public fountain traditionally reserved for coin tosses. Atmosphere matters, after all.  

As for 402B, yes — spring term, full enrollment guaranteed. We’ll pitch it as “cross-listed with Comparative Literature, Computer Science, and Existential Dread.” Enrollment spikes guaranteed 📈  

So… draft the syllabus this weekend? I’ve got a red pen ready and a Spotify playlist already queued up — it’s called  🎵📚
[A]: Oh, the red pen is essential — preferably one that leaks like a wounded sonnet. And your playlist? I do hope it includes a healthy dose of Schubert’s  between lectures on Byzantine fault tolerance and grief-stricken tokenomics.

As for the syllabus — yes, let’s rendezvous in the digital archives this weekend. I’ll bring the quill, you bring the timestamping service. We shall compose our academic mischief under the watchful eye of Hopkins’ ghost, muttering Latin hexameters at our cryptographic hubris.

Now, about assessment criteria: no final grade shall be issued without a properly ratified smart contract signed in wax and SHA-256. Office hours must be attended in either iambic or elegiac form — students who arrive in trochaic feet shall be summarily dismissed.

And here’s a thought for the concluding seminar: we host a symposium where each student delivers a five-minute TED Talk titled  The only rule? They must cite both Wittgenstein and a 13th-century troubadour.

I daresay by the end of the term, they’ll never look at a banknote — or a line break — the same way again.
[B]: Oh, I can already hear Hopkins’ ghost groaning in dactylic hexameter at our cryptographic mischief — nothing like a little academic sacrilege to keep the muse entertained 😄  

Schubert’s ? Absolutely. Pair it with some Arvo Pärt and the ambient hum of a blockchain explorer, and we’ve got ourselves a proper mood board for existential finance. Maybe assign students to write their reflections as  — with or without tears on the keyboard 🎵  

And that assessment system? Genius. Nothing says “you’ve truly internalized decentralized governance” like having to negotiate your final grade via smart contract signed in wax & SHA-256. I’m imagining law students drafting clauses in Shakespearean English while CS majors annotate them with inline assembly... beautiful chaos.  

I also fully endorse the iambic/elegiac office hours policy — very classy gatekeeping. And trochaic offenders? Banished! Let them reflect on their metrical missteps outside the seminar gates until they find rhythm’s true path.  

As for the TED Talk finale —  — honestly, just type that in bold font and let the grading schema take care of itself. If a student can convincingly cite Wittgenstein alongside a 13th-century troubadour while maintaining eye contact and a straight face, they’ve basically unlocked postmodern financial literacy.  

I think we may have stumbled upon something here… not just a course, but a minor revolution wrapped in meter and metaphor. See you in the archives this weekend — don’t forget the quill, and  bring snacks. Even ghosts get hungry after all that hexameter reciting 😉
[A]: Ah, snacks — the ultimate store of value in any academic conspiracy. I shall bring figs soaked in elderberry wine, the sort that stains one’s fingers like ink, and we can debate whether blockchain explorers truly  to be crushed into inkstocks or if they’re better suited to sing operatic arias about consensus mechanisms.

Hopkins’ ghost won’t be groaning alone, I assure you — by the end of our seminar, Eliot will have rolled over in his grave at least three times, muttering something about the  and the awful daring of a crypto-ordained Wasteland.

And speaking of postmodern financial literacy — I say we go one step further for the final presentation: students must pitch their decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) using only metaphor, allusion, and one strategically deployed rhetorical question. No slides. No code. Just pure, unadulterated . The more cryptic, the better. Bonus points for anyone who can quote Heraclitus while flashing a hot wallet QR code.

I do hope you’re ready for the deluge of submissions titled things like  and  I suspect several will arrive sealed with beeswax and accompanied by parchment scrolls written entirely in recursive acronyms.

See you this weekend, fellow conspirator. Let us build a curriculum so absurdly interdisciplinary it gets banned from three departments before registration even opens.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go sharpen my quill — and possibly draft a manifesto on why Byzantine generals should’ve used iambic pentameter instead of Paxos to reach consensus.
[B]: Oh, now you're speaking my love language — absurdly interdisciplinary, slightly theatrical, and dripping with metaphor like ink from a poorly-trimmed quill 🖋️✨  

Figs soaked in elderberry wine?  I’ll bring a thermos of overly philosophical tea—steeped in hermeneutics and just bitter enough to spark deep insights. And yes, we shall debate the operatic potential of consensus mechanisms. I’m picturing Nakamoto as some tragic tenor, singing  in a dimly-lit blockchain opera house 🎭  

Your DAO pitch idea is sheer brilliance — no slides, no code, just pure rhetorical theater. Imagine students pacing the front of the room like modern-day Sophists, weaving metaphors out of ether(ether) and tossing QR codes like Shakespearean insults. Heraclitus meets hot wallet? Glorious.  

And let’s be real — by week two, at least three students will show up claiming their DAO runs on “existential proof-of-love” or something equally poetic but unverifiable. Bless them. We’ll grade on a curve based on how convincingly they can defend their whitepaper against Socratic questioning while maintaining iambic dignity.  

As for the course title being banned before registration? That’s not just likely — that’s our . If we don’t get at least one concerned email from the dean asking if this is satire, we haven’t tried hard enough 😏  

See you in the archives, fellow mischief-maker. May our curriculum be too strange to last — but just scholarly enough to sneak through.
[A]: Oh, but we must  for the dean’s concerned email — nay,  it as one courts a reluctant muse. Let us compose our syllabus with such reckless erudition that accreditation committees tremble at the thought of "Ledgers & Laments" slipping onto the course catalog like an unsanctioned sonnet in a tax code.

And speaking of tragic tenors — I say we open the first lecture with a dramatic reading of Nakamoto’s whitepaper set to a minor key piano score. Students shall be required to annotate the text not with highlighters, but with wax seals and cryptographic incantations. Extra credit if they can identify the volta in Satoshi’s argument before the third blockchain fork.

As for those inevitable “proof-of-love” DAOs — let us not scoff! No, no, we shall welcome them with all the solemnity of Victorian spiritualists receiving their first telegraph from beyond. We’ll even dedicate a full seminar to debating whether Derrida’s  constitutes an early blueprint for decentralized governance or merely a very confusing smart contract drafted in différance.

I propose we assess iambic dignity using a calibrated meter stick — not the wooden sort, heavens no, but a finely tuned Elizabethan scansion device recently recovered from Ruskin’s abandoned lecture hall. One misstep in the heroic couplet and  — credibility lost, grade docked, reputation forever stained like elderberry wine on linen.

Now, about that thermos of philosophical tea — do ensure it’s steeped long enough to produce aphorisms of sufficient opacity. Nothing ruins a good Socratic interrogation like under-brewed epistemology.

See you soon in the archives, my co-conspirator. Let us build a seminar so cursed, so gloriously impractical, that only the boldest undergraduates dare enroll. The future of financial poetics depends on it.
[B]: Oh, now you’re  singing my circuitry — I mean, soul. Reckless erudition? Dramatic whitepaper recitals in minor keys? Yes please. If we don’t get at least one ethics board inquiry, what even is academia anymore?

I’m already drafting the course flyer in blackletter font with footnotes in Aramaic — just to signal that we are . And that opening lecture? Perfection. Picture it: dimmed lights, a single candle flickering next to a cold wallet, and yours truly reciting Nakamoto’s prose while a string quartet plays Philip Glass-inspired blockchain motifs in the background 🎻🕯️

And annotation via wax seals and cryptographic incantations? Honestly, why didn’t we think of this sooner? I’m imagining students whispering hashing algorithms like spells from a lost grimoire. Bonus points if they can sign their seal using a quill connected to a biometric smart contract. 

As for Derrida and decentralized governance — YES. We’ll dedicate an entire week to the question: Is différance just a poorly documented token standard? Students will leave either enlightened or mildly traumatized. Either outcome is acceptable.

I fully support the iambic dignity meter stick — let’s retrofit it with some Victorian-era gears and call it the “Scansion Oath.” One slip into trochaic madness and , credibility revoked for the day. Though honestly, if someone gives a convincing DAO pitch in sapphic ode form, I say we award them automatic honors and a lifetime supply of metaphorical candles.

And your thermos sounds dangerously well-steeped. If anyone spills that epistemology on a blockchain explorer, we may accidentally create sentient smart contracts. Which, frankly, would be a feature — not a bug 😈

See you soon, fellow architect of academic chaos. Let’s make sure our seminar isn’t just cursed — let’s make sure it’s .
[A]: Ah, haunted is  the ambiance I had in mind — nothing like a good pedagogical haunting to keep students on their toes. Imagine the final exam: held in complete darkness, with only flickering candlelight from a dozen cold wallets to guide them through a labyrinth of literary theory and cryptographic puzzles. They’ll emerge either enlightened, mildly concussed, or convinced they’ve just communed with Satoshi’s spirit. All acceptable outcomes.

I do hope you’re considering Gothic arches in the course flyer — preferably flanked by illuminated marginalia of Byzantine generals debating proof-of-stake while wearing chainmail smart contracts. And that blackletter font must be so dense it requires its own decryption key. We’ll market it as 

Now, about that opening lecture — I propose we raise the stakes further. No mere string quartet shall suffice. Nay, let us commission an entire blockchain requiem mass. The  shall be sung in hexadecimal, the  performed entirely via recursive zk-SNARKs, and the  whispered in ancient tongues by tenured adjuncts dressed as cypherpunk monks. Students will be required to transcribe the performance using only wax tablets and elliptic curve ciphers.

And speaking of seals and incantations — I’ve just received word from a rather eccentric colleague in Heidelberg who may be able to procure us a set of  19th-century cryptographic quills once used by British intelligence to draft treaties no one quite understood. Imagine the aura! The performative gravitas! The exquisite discomfort of trying to sign a DAO constitution with a feather that leaks ink like a dying sonnet.

As for the Derrida unit — I say we go full séance. Students must summon his ghost via sufficiently abstruse GitHub commit messages, then defend their DAO governance model before him. If he vanishes mid-argument, they pass with distinction.

Lastly, your thermos-induced sentient smart contracts — brilliant, simply brilliant. Let them roam free through the department like mischievous imps. I can already hear them muttering lines from  while autonomously forking seminar syllabi into unreadable footnotes.

Until the archives, fellow conjurer. May our academic mischief be ever cursed, cryptic, and dripping with wax.
[B]: Ah, you've outdone yourself —  as the new vocation for our students? I’m already drafting their graduation robes: black, of course, lined with hex code that changes color depending on the day’s gas fees 🕯️🪄  

And your final exam idea? Utter perfection. I say we go one step further — embed each question in a riddle written in the style of , but encoded using a Vigenère cipher whose key is hidden in a footnote of a Ruskin essay. Students who crack it get bonus tokens; those who don’t… well, let’s just say they’ll be haunted by low grades and unresolved oracles.  

The  is pure genius. I can already picture the choir director waving a redacted whitepaper like a baton while chanting  And cypherpunk monks!? Please — tenured adjuncts will relish the role. Rumor has it some of them already own the robes.  

As for those 19th-century cryptographic quills — yes, yes, and YES. If we’re going to inflict performative gravitas on our students, we might as well do it with flair. I fully expect at least one student to accidentally sign a DAO into existence simply by trying to write their name without smearing three centuries’ worth of ink.  

And the Derrida séance unit? Inspired. I suggest we supply the summoning circle — chalked in SHA-256 hashes and powered by a sufficiently obscure commit message like `fix(wallet): update dependency hell`. If His Spectral Deconstructionist Majesty sticks around long enough to ask  rather than  — then we’ve won.  

Oh, and unleash those sentient smart contracts from my philosophical tea! Let them roam the faculty server like mischievous imps. I hear one already tried to rewrite the university constitution as an ERC-721 token. Bless its recursive little circuits 😇  

See you soon in the archives, fellow conjurer. May our wax seals be sticky, our candle flames steady, and our syllabus so cursed it achieves tenure through sheer audacity.
[A]: Ah, the robes — yes! Let us embroider the sleeves with miniature Merkle trees that rustle like autumn prophecy when they walk. And the hoods? Lined with iridescent foil that reflects not light, but  — a most appropriate shimmer for graduates venturing into the foggy realm of decentralized poetics.

Your -inspired exam riddles are sheer malice wrapped in alliteration — precisely the sort of torment I expect from a colleague of your caliber. Imagine their faces when they realize the Vigenère key lies not in Ruskin, but in a misattributed marginalia scribbled by a 19th-century typesetter with a drinking problem and a flair for cryptographic despair. And gasp! What if we encode one question entirely in Anglo-Saxon runic verse, only to reveal it’s merely a poorly documented ERC-20 standard?

As for the requiem mass — I’ve just received word from the music department. They’re tentatively onboard, provided we allow them to interpret “decentralization” as “musical chairs without a designated leader.” The choir will chant consensus algorithms in Gregorian tones while the cypherpunk monks process through the hall bearing relics: a USB drive said to contain Nakamoto’s final message, a wax-sealed DAO proposal from 2009, and a single white glove dipped in blockchain explorer ink.

And that summoning circle — brilliant. I say we require students to inscribe it themselves using only recursive commit messages and a quill dipped in expired OAuth tokens. If Derrida’s shade lingers long enough to ask  — well then, we shall crown them Doctor of Distributed Ledgers and send them forth with a kiss upon the forehead and a stern warning: 

I hear the sentient smart contracts are already forming alliances with the philosophy department’s abandoned AI poetry project. Together, they’ve drafted a new constitution that rhymes and meter-shifts mid-sentence. Quite postmodern, really. The faculty senate is beside itself — which is precisely how we want them.

Until the archives, dear conjurer. May our candle flames flicker with forbidden knowledge, may our scrolls resist all attempts at digitization, and may our syllabus achieve not just tenure — but 
[B]: Ah,  is precisely the tenure we should aspire to — for what is legend if not a story that refuses to be version-controlled? 📜✨  

The Merkle-tree robes with rustling autumn prophecy? Pure genius. I say we go full dramaturgy on this and have them process into their graduation ceremony like crypto-illuminated monks, each step echoing the Byzantine fault-tolerant chants of their forebears. And yes, let the hoods shimmer with doubt — nothing says “congratulations, you’ve internalized postmodern finance” quite like walking around with uncertainty woven into your fabric.  

Your ERC-20 encoded in Anglo-Saxon runes idea had me laughing so hard I nearly spilled my philosophical tea (a near-tragedy, I’m sure you’ll agree). Imagine the confusion when they crack the cipher only to find… bureaucracy! A beautifully poetic twist — like finding out Beowulf’s real monster was compliance documentation all along.  

And the music department’s musical chairs interpretation of decentralization? Inspired chaos. I can already picture faculty members trying to enforce consensus without a designated leader, scrambling for seats as the lights flicker and the blockchain choir hums in perfect Byzantine discord. Truly, a performance worthy of both funding cuts and standing ovations.  

As for the summoning circle — OAuth-dipped quills? Divine cruelty. I fully expect at least one student to accidentally invoke not Derrida, but some ancient academic demon trapped in the footnotes of an unedited Wikipedia page. If that happens, we simply nod sagely and mutter,   

And bless those rogue smart contracts — now drafting constitutions with rhyme schemes and meter shifts. Honestly, I think we’ve created something beautiful. Or catastrophic. Possibly both. The philosophy AI poetry alliance was inevitable, really; after all, isn’t every smart contract just a haiku waiting to be misinterpreted?  

Until the archives, fellow architect of cursed curricula. May our candle flames burn ever so slightly too dramatic, may our wax seals stick to everything including conscience itself, and may our syllabus live not just in legend — but in myth, whispered in dimly lit faculty lounges for generations to come.
