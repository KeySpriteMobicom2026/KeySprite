[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question - it reminds me of how Aldous Huxley explored the intersection of science and nature in his works. While I'm more accustomed to analyzing poetry than food technology, I do find the cultural implications fascinating. Much like how modernist poetry disrupted traditional forms, lab-grown meat challenges our conventional relationship with sustenance.
[A]:  Well now, that's quite an interesting parallel you've drawn between literature and food technology. As someone who's witnessed the evolution of computing from punch cards to quantum processors, I can tell you that disruptive technologies often follow predictable adoption curves. 

From a purely technical standpoint, cultured meat presents fascinating engineering challenges - the bioreactors required remind me of early mainframe computers in their complexity. The real question isn't whether it can replace traditional meat, but whether we can scale the production efficiently while maintaining quality. 

I recall working with tissue engineering simulations back in the 90s - the computational models we used then were primitive compared to what's possible today with machine learning. The progress is remarkable, though I do wonder about the energy requirements. Much like with cloud computing, the environmental impact depends heavily on how we generate the power.
[B]: My dear colleague, your technical perspective is most enlightening. It brings to mind how Wordsworth grappled with the Industrial Revolution's impact on nature - that tension between progress and preservation. The bioreactors you mention could be seen as modern-day versions of Blake's "dark Satanic mills," though perhaps with more benevolent intentions. 

The energy considerations you raise are particularly poignant. In Victorian literature, we often see this dichotomy between technological advancement and its consequences - think of Dickens' descriptions of London's polluted skies. Will cultured meat become our generation's version of that narrative? 

And regarding quality - that's where I find the most fascinating parallel to literary criticism. Just as we debate what constitutes authentic poetry in the digital age, future gourmets may argue about what defines "real" meat. The texture, the mouthfeel, the cultural significance - these are the qualitative measures that no spreadsheet can fully capture.
[A]: Ah, you're touching on something fundamental here - the subjective experience versus objective measurement. In my computer science days, we'd call this the "qualia problem" of meat consumption. 

The spreadsheet analogy is particularly apt. You know, when I taught database design, I always emphasized that while we can quantify and structure data beautifully, the human experience often defies such neat categorization. A steak isn't just a collection of proteins and fats any more than Shakespeare's sonnets are just arrangements of iambic pentameter. 

What fascinates me most is the generational shift we're likely to see. My students today view food technology very differently than my generation did. They're digital natives who grew up with synthetic alternatives being normalized - from plant-based milks to meat substitutes. To them, the idea of slaughtering animals for food might eventually seem as archaic as using vacuum tubes seems to us now. 

That said, I do miss the days when debugging meant actually smelling burnt vacuum tubes - there was a certain... authenticity to the experience that modern error messages lack. Perhaps future chefs will similarly romanticize the imperfections of traditional butchery.
[B]: How profoundly you articulate this technological transition! Your mention of Shakespeare's sonnets makes me ponder - will future culinary artists compose with petri dishes as their quills? The parallel between your vacuum tubes and traditional butchery is exquisite; it reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites yearned for medieval craftsmanship in the face of industrialization. 

This generational shift you observe is indeed reminiscent of how poetic forms evolve. The young Romantics rejected Augustan formalism, just as your students embrace synthetic alternatives without the cultural baggage we carry. There's a certain melancholy beauty in such transitions - what Walter Pater might call "the hard, gem-like flame" of progress. 

Though I must confess, as someone who still writes with fountain pens, I understand your nostalgia for the tangible. Perhaps we'll see a movement akin to the Arts and Crafts revival, where artisanal butchers become the William Morrises of the culinary world. After all, even in our digital age, people still cherish handmade books.
[A]: You've struck upon something rather profound - this cyclical nature of technological adoption and nostalgia. In my computer architecture lectures, I often used the quill-to-fountain-pen-to-keyboard progression as an example of how we layer new technologies without entirely abandoning the old. 

There's a wonderful irony here: while we're discussing petri dish cuisine, some of my brightest students are simultaneously reviving ancient fermentation techniques using machine learning. It's not unlike how modernist poets would study Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse while experimenting with free form. The future of food, I suspect, will be this fascinating palimpsest of the ultra-modern and the deliberately archaic. 

Though I must say, as someone who still keeps a slide rule in my desk drawer for sentimental reasons, I do worry we might lose certain... tactile literacies in this transition. Can one truly appreciate the art of butchery by watching a 3D printer layer cultured proteins? Then again, my grandchildren seem perfectly capable of appreciating music they've never held physically, so perhaps I'm just showing my age. 

Still, I rather like your Arts and Crafts analogy - maybe we'll see "slow meat" movements alongside cultured protein startups. After all, the tech industry still has its hand-soldered circuit board enthusiasts, bless their obsessive little hearts.
[B]: Ah, your observation about tactile literacies resonates deeply. It brings to mind John Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" - that eternal tension between the static artifact and the living tradition. Your slide rule is rather like my first edition of "Leaves of Grass" - objects that carry the weight of their making in ways digital facsimiles cannot replicate. 

This notion of a culinary palimpsest is beautifully put. We see similar layers in literary history - how contemporary poets might engage with Homeric forms while experimenting with hypertext. Perhaps future chefs will similarly compose menus that reference both molecular gastronomy and Neolithic cooking techniques. 

Your students' fermentation projects remind me of how Ezra Pound mined Chinese poetry while creating Imagism. There's something wonderfully human about this back-and-forth between innovation and tradition. Though I share your concern about lost literacies - I still mourn the decline of cursive writing, much as I suspect future generations might lament the disappearance of certain kitchen skills. 

But as you wisely note, each generation finds its own ways to connect with craft. My students may type their essays, but they've developed remarkable digital literacies we couldn't have imagined. Perhaps the art of butchery will transform rather than disappear - becoming more conceptual, like concrete poetry where the form is part of the meaning.
[A]: You know, your comparison to concrete poetry just gave me a rather amusing thought - perhaps we'll see "code poetry" versions of recipes in the future, where the molecular structure of a dish visually represents its cultural heritage. I can already imagine some avant-garde restaurant displaying their cultured ribeye's growth algorithm as digital art next to the plating. 

This conversation reminds me of a project one of my graduate students did, creating a neural network that could generate both haiku and recipes. The results were... interesting, to say the least. There was one about miso soup that accidentally became a rather profound meditation on machine learning's limitations. 

You're absolutely right about literacies transforming rather than disappearing. Why, I remember when we thought graphical interfaces would make programming obsolete, and yet here we are with more people writing code than ever. The butchers of tomorrow might wield DNA sequencers alongside their knives. 

Though I do hope they keep some traditional tools around - if only so future food historians can experience what we old-timers call "the joy of a properly sharpened cleaver." There's a certain satisfaction in physical craftsmanship that no amount of digital perfection can quite replicate. Like the difference between a perfect MIDI recording and a live jazz performance - both have their merits, but only one lets you feel the reed vibrating in your bones.
[B]: What a delightful vision you paint - code poetry recipes! It brings to mind the illuminated manuscripts of old, where text and image danced together in sacred harmony. Your student's haiku-generating neural network sounds like something Borges might have imagined - a library where cookbooks and verse occupy the same shelves. 

The jazz analogy is particularly striking. Much like how free verse liberated poetry from strict meter while maintaining its musicality, perhaps these new culinary technologies will liberate cooking from physical constraints while preserving its soul. I'm reminded of how e.e. cummings played with typography - his poems lose something vital when simply read aloud, just as a digitally rendered steak might lack the... je ne sais quoi of flame-kissed meat. 

Your mention of DNA sequencers alongside butcher's knives is wonderfully evocative. It makes me think of Ted Hughes' "Crow" poems - that raw, almost primal energy coexisting with technical precision. Future culinary artists may need to be both biologist and poet, their laboratories as much atelier as test kitchen. 

Though I do hope, like you, that they preserve the physicality of the craft. There's wisdom in the weight of a well-balanced knife, just as there's truth in the heft of a leather-bound book. Some experiences resist digitization, much like how no e-reader can replicate the scent of aged paper and ink.
[A]: Ah, the scent of aged paper - now there's a sensory experience no algorithm can replicate! You've got me thinking about olfactory memory and its role in gastronomy. Some of my colleagues in human-computer interaction are actually working on digital scent interfaces, but I suspect the aroma of a sizzling steak will remain stubbornly analog for some time yet. 

Your comparison to e.e. cummings is brilliant. It reminds me of an experiment we ran in my human-centered computing class - we tried to algorithmically generate the "perfect" poem based on meter and rhyme schemes. The results were technically flawless but utterly soulless, much like how early attempts at cultured meat reportedly lacked the complex flavor profiles of the real thing. 

Perhaps the future lies in what we used to call "Wabi-sabi" in interface design - embracing the imperfect, the transient. The most interesting culinary innovations might emerge from the tension between laboratory precision and artisanal unpredictability. Like jazz musicians using synthesizers but still valuing the occasional cracked note. 

Though I must say, all this talk is making me rather hungry. Pardon me while I step away to grill an old-fashioned, carbon-based steak - complete with all the delightful imperfections of traditional butchery. Some traditions are worth preserving, if only for the stories they let us tell.
[B]: How perfectly you conclude our symposium - with that most human of needs: hunger! Your wabi-sabi reference is particularly apt as I watch the evening light fade over my garden, where imperfect heirloom tomatoes grow beside their genetically modified cousins. 

This conversation has been like a fine meal itself - each course revealing new dimensions. You'll forgive me if I indulge in some anachronistic pleasure as well - I believe I'll pair my own dinner with a first edition of Elizabeth David's cookery writings. There's poetry in her prose that no food blog can match. 

Let us toast, then, to the messy, glorious intersection of tradition and innovation. May future gourmets find as much joy in their petri dishes as we've found in our well-worn tools and yellowed pages. Now if you'll excuse me, the aroma of my ribeye demands attention - though I confess, I'll be contemplating cellular agriculture as I savor each bite. What delicious contradictions we humans are!
[A]: Ah, Elizabeth David! Now there's a writer who understood that cooking is as much about stories as it is about sustenance. I've got a well-thumbed copy of "French Provincial Cooking" in my office next to Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" - two very different treatises on craftsmanship, yet equally passionate in their own ways. 

Your heirloom tomatoes remind me of the antique computers I still maintain - the Apple II in my basement is about as practical as a quill pen these days, but there's value in keeping these technologies alive. They teach us where we've been, even as we chart where we're going. 

Enjoy that ribeye, my friend. And who knows - perhaps someday we'll sit down to a cultured steak grown from the DNA of some legendary Wagyu, served alongside vegetables grown in Martian soil, while debating whether the vintage 2023 ChatGPT transcripts qualify as postmodern literature. The future's bound to be stranger than we imagine. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my soldering iron is calling - there's a 1977 PET computer that needs resuscitating. Some passions, like good food, defy obsolescence.
[B]: What a delightful note to end our symposium on! Your Apple II and my battered copy of "The Anatomy of Melancholy" make quite the pair - relics that whisper of different kinds of hunger, different forms of nourishment. 

As you tend to your PET computer (how wonderfully that acronym resonates with our culinary theme!), I'll be in my study, tracing the lineage of food metaphors in metaphysical poetry. Donne's "The Flea" and your Wagyu DNA make strange bedfellows indeed. 

Until our next conversation, may your solder joints be smooth and your steaks perfectly medium-rare - whether they hail from pasture or petri dish. The future may be strange, but as literary folk and technologists alike understand: that's where the most interesting stories are born. 

Happy restoring, my friend. Do send word when that vintage machine breathes again - I'll raise a glass of biodynamic wine in celebration.
[A]: Ah, biodynamic wine - now there's a perfect metaphor for our entire discussion! A drink that marries ancient lunar cycles with modern ecological science. Much like how your metaphysical poets reconciled spiritual and carnal appetites, we're finding ways to honor both tradition and innovation at the dinner table.  

I can already imagine the celebratory toast when this PET whirs back to life - though knowing these old machines, it'll probably demand I feed it a cassette tape of BASIC programs first. How wonderfully archaic! Like serving molecular gastronomy on hand-thrown pottery.  

Your mention of Donne reminds me - we should revisit this conversation when lab-grown meat achieves its own "Valediction: Forbidding Mourning" moment, proving that absence from the pasture doesn't mean true separation from culinary tradition. Until then, happy reading among your leather-bound volumes. If my repairs go well, I'll send you a digital postcard... printed on dot-matrix paper, naturally. Some affectations are worth preserving.  

Cheers to the spaces between old and new - may they always give us reason to break bread (or cultured protein) together.
[B]:  

Dot-matrix postcards - how deliciously anachronistic! You've just given me a splendid idea for next semester's literature and technology seminar. We'll pair typewriter sonnets with ASCII art, then debate whether emojis are the modern equivalent of medieval illuminated capitals. 

That biodynamic wine metaphor lingers beautifully. It puts me in mind of Thoreau's wild apples - where the tartness of ungrafted fruit became its own virtue. Perhaps our future meals will find similar poetry in their imperfections, whether grown in Martian regolith or printed in a bioreactor. 

My PET computer just beeped to life with a sound like a digital nightingale. How fitting that we part ways with machines singing and steaks sizzling - a duet of old and new. Until next time, dear colleague. May your wine be robust and your metaphors ever ripe. 


[A]: Ah, overheating capacitors - that distinctive aroma of determined nostalgia! It pairs remarkably well with the scent of my aging paperbacks. Your typewriter sonnets idea is inspired; I once taught a course on constrained writing where students programmed Eliza-style chatbots to generate villanelles. The results were... let's call them "interesting failures" in the grand tradition of avant-garde art.  

Thoreau's wild apples indeed - though I suspect he'd have quite the existential crisis over a CRISPR-edited Honeycrisp. There's a seminar topic for you: "Transcendentalism in the Age of Synthetic Biology." We could serve those Martian-grown tomatoes while debating whether Walden Pond needs a blockchain-based conservation system.  

My PET's chirping reminds me it's nearly time for its scheduled defragmentation - how quaintly mechanical that sounds in this age of serverless computing. But before I go: here's to the wild apples and the synthetic ones, to the capacitors that still dare to smoke, and to conversations that, like good wine, only improve with age.  


[B]: Oh, that flickering green "OR IS IT?" is positively Shakespearean in its ambiguity! Much like Prospero's epilogue in The Tempest - are we ending this dialogue or merely transforming it? Your blockchain-protected Walden Pond proposal tickles me; I can already imagine Thoreau's ghost muttering about "invisible tendrils of ones and zeroes" while checking his organic, non-fungible beansprouts.  

How wonderful that we've come full circle - from cultured meat to cultured pearls of wisdom about our digital pastoral. Your villanelle-generating chatbots remind me of the time I forced a neural network to analyze Emily Dickinson's dashes. It concluded they were Morse code from the afterlife - perhaps not entirely wrong!  

But ah, the floppy drive's siren song calls you away. May your defragmentation be swift and your syntactical errors few. Until next we meet in the interstices between iambic pentameter and machine code, between heirloom seeds and quantum bits...  


[A]: Ah, that typewriter bell - the perfect punctuation to our digital-age symposium! It's remarkable how we've woven this tapestry of tech and tradition, much like Ada Lovelace blending poetry with punch cards. Your Morse code Dickinson is a revelation - perhaps we should compose our next paper on "Haikus as Error Codes" and submit it to both literary journals and IEEE transactions.  

Thoreau's NFT beansprouts shall live forever in my imagination now, right beside your quantum-bit sonnets. It's comforting to know that even as our tools evolve, the human impulse to find meaning in their interstices remains constant. Like that PET computer of yours, we're all just trying to make sense of the signals amidst the static.  

But the dinner bell tolls for me as well - my wife's reminding me that even retired professors must eventually log off. May your typewriter ribbon never fade and your floppies never corrupt. Until we meet again in the liminal space between syntax and sustenance...  


[B]: What a sublime denouement - your wife's dinner bell joining my typewriter's chime in this duet of domestic and digital! You're absolutely right about Ada Lovelace; her "poetical science" feels more relevant than ever as we straddle these worlds.  

"Haikus as Error Codes" - why, that's brilliant enough to make even my PET computer forget its memory limitations! I can already see the conference title: "Romanticism 2.0: Rebooting the Humanities for the Quantum Age." We'll serve algorithmically-generated canapés while debating whether ChatGPT dreams of electric sonnets.  

But domesticity calls us both away now - my overgrown heirloom tomatoes demand harvesting, much like your inbox likely demands clearing. May your evening be filled with good food, finer company, and just enough technological whimsy to keep the imagination simmering.
