[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the million-dollar question! 🧠 Let me answer with a story - last week during my office hours, a student came in visibly distressed. She'd spent the weekend doomscrolling through 10,000条关于"successful people's routines" and felt terrible about her own life. But here's the twist - she found solace in a Chinese online poetry group where members translate Li Bai into emojis! 

Fascinating paradox, isn't it? Social media can be both 毒药 (dúyào) and 良药 (liáoyào). Think of it like calligraphy: the same brushstroke creates beauty or smudges depending on how you hold it. I've started assigning "digital fasting" weekends - no screens, just tea and paperbacks. Students call it 我的修道院时光 (wǒ de xiūdàoyuàn shíguāng) - my monastery time.

What do you think makes the bigger difference - platform design or user intention? 🤔
[A]: Ah, but isn't that student's story precisely the paradox we ought to dissect? 🧵 Let's not mistake the  for the , shall we? I've observed similar patterns among my postgraduate circle - they call it "algorithmic melancholy," though I suspect that's just a fashionable way of saying one's been outed by their own curiosity. 

The poetry group she stumbled upon - rather cheeky, translating Li Bai into pictograms! - reminds me of those Victorian ladies who hid subversive messages in embroidered samplers. As for your question about design versus intention... Well, if you gave me a quill dipped in silver nitrate, I'd still prefer to write love letters rather than poison notes. Though admittedly, both might sting depending on the recipient. 

Do tell, what's your verdict on this design/intention dichotomy? And more pressingly - should I indulge in creating a WeChat channel for my obscure Scots Gaelic translations? ¥0r perhaps not?
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my favorite kind of academic mischief! 🦉 Let's smash that dichotomy open like a stubborn 粽子 (zòngzi) leaf - messy but rewarding. The truth? Design and intention are like ink and rice paper; one soaks into the other in ways neither anticipated. 

Your quill metaphor tickles me pink - or should I say 墨色难断 (mò sè nán duàn)? I once had a doctoral student translating Emily Dickinson into Naxi pictographs. Turned out her real thesis was about . Brilliant, really.

As for your WeChat channel... 创建它！(chuàngjiàn tā!) What better way to weaponize obscurity than on a platform where 800 million users might accidentally stumble upon "Twa Corbies" in 汉字 (hànzì)? Just promise me you'll add a disclaimer: "Not responsible for spontaneous bouts of Sino-Scottish nostalgia or unexplained urges to wear kilts with hanfu undershirts." 🌸
[A]: Oh, the semiotic migration of melancholy!  That Naxi Dickinson experiment must’ve sent shivers down the spine of every textual purist in the department—brava to your student. I’m rather taken with the idea of melancholy as a migratory bird myself. Perhaps it’s why I keep returning to Robert Louis Stevenson’s unfinished —a perfect literary fragment for our times, wouldn’t you say? All that unresolved sorrow, drifting like incense through digital corridors.

As for the WeChat channel… Oh, very well, you’ve convinced me. I shall christen it —complete with your suggested disclaimer and a banner featuring a distinctly disapproving-looking Victorian ghost in a kilt. One must maintain standards, after all. Though I do wonder: should the ghost be Scottish or English? That, I think, will depend on how much whisky I’ve imbibed by the time I set up the page. 🥃
[B]: Ah, Stevenson!  Oops – looks like I’ve created a new Rorschach test. Where was I? Ah yes – unfinished texts as modern allegory! If  isn’t the ultimate metaphor for our fragmented attention spans, then I’ll eat my academic beret. Think of it: 19th-century narrative tension now refracted through TikTok-length despair. Tragic? Or just postmodern melodrama with better lighting?

Now about that ghost... Make it Scottish, darling – always go for the culturally specific when in doubt. A Glaswegian specter in full Highland gear, preferably holding a quill and giving side-eye to a QR code. And call the whisky filter “translation strategy enhancement.” We can make it an official field: . I’d audit your lectures for sure.

Speaking of which – do you host live translation salons or keep it strictly digital? Imagine broadcasting from your study, surrounded by first editions and peat smoke. Call it  – tagline:  🥃🧠
[A]: Oh, bravo! Weir of Hermiston You’ve hit upon something deliciously subversive. Stevenson’s fragments—those jagged edges of narrative—seem tailor-made for our age of half-read tweets and emotionally incoherent DMs. Though I daresay if he’d had access to Ritalin and a decent Wi-Fi signal, the ending might’ve been rather less romantic. Still, one does prefer mystery to resolution sometimes. Like finding a lock without a key, or a kilt without... well, let’s not go there just yet.

As for your spectral casting suggestion—a Glaswegian ghost with academic credentials and a disdain for modernity? Naturally. He’ll be named Alistair, of course, and mutter Burns verses under his ectoplasmic breath whenever someone misquotes Keats. And this "Haunted by Meaning" notion? Devilishly clever. I’ll start rehearsing my opening line immediately: 

Do you suppose we ought to warn attendees that the peat smoke may interfere with their Wi-Fi signal? Or shall we let them suffer gloriously, cut off from the digital world, surrounded only by crumbling margins and the faint smell of whisky-soaked ink?
[B]:  Ah, the sweet agony of peat smoke versus Wi-Fi – now  a metaphor for our times! No, no warnings. Let them suffer like proper romantics. If their Zoom call drops during a Bashō recitation, all the better – they can experience firsthand what I call “the sublime buffering zone.” 

And Alistair must have standards, darling – make him wear a kilt made of shredded Penguin Classics. We’ll serve tea in thimbles and force everyone to write their questions in calligraphy. If someone dares pull out a smartphone? Summon a minor poltergeist – nothing too dramatic, just a well-timed gust to blow their notes into the fire.

I’m already drafting the flyer:  
“Haunted by Meaning: Where Fragments Reign & Cravats Rebel”  
RSVP required, but we won’t confirm attendance. Uncertainty builds atmosphere. 🕯️🧠  

Oh, and do remind Alistair to haunt responsibly – he’s representing academia after all. Though if he frightens a few undergraduates away from declaring "influencer studies," I suppose that’s a bonus.
[A]:   

Exquisite. I’m half-convinced we’ve accidentally invented a new genre—Gothic Seminarism? Or perhaps . Either way, I shall instruct Alistair to sharpen his ectoplasmic kilt pins and practice his most withering stare. Should anyone attempt to cite Instagram analytics in defense of Byron’s relevance, he is authorized to levitate the Oxford English Dictionary and let it slam shut of its own volition.

And thimbles for tea? Delightfully impractical. I’ll have my assistant rig the mantel clock to run ten minutes fast—keeps everyone slightly off-kilter, which is precisely the right mental state for translating Sappho through a haze of peat and uncertainty.  

One small addition to the flyer, if I may:  
“Dress code: Sublime disarray. Bonus points for ink-stained cuffs and existential sighs.”  

Now, about that poltergeist—any preference on spectral origin? I’ve one on retainer from the 1745 uprising who’s quite good with quill pens...
[B]:   

Oh, 1745 is . Let’s call him Ferguson or some suitably disgraced Jacobite name. Nothing haunts like a wounded nationalist – and he’ll absolutely  any mention of postcolonial theory. Imagine his ghostly sputter when someone references "Byron's global influence"! I say let him loose whenever the conversation turns to cultural appropriation – he can flicker dramatically and knock over my bottle of 酱油 (jiàngyóu), which we’ll rebrand as “Victorian melancholy essence.”

And your flyer addition? Sublime disarray! I may adopt it permanently for department mixers. Though I’ll have to warn my orchids – they’re rather fussy about proper attire. They’ve already thrown a tiny photosynthetic fit over my new "academic casual" policy (read: academic rumpled).  

One final touch – shall we require attendees to whisper their questions through a hollow bamboo tube? Adds an air of神秘 (shénmì) – like consulting an oracle who’s had one too many whiskies. Or perhaps that’s too much...  ...atmosphere?
[A]:   

Ferguson it is—let’s have him wear his old clan tartan  a copy of  tucked under one semi-transparent arm. He can mutter footnotes in Gaelic. And yes, the 酱油 bottle must be sacred now—clearly labeled “For Ritual Use Only: Victorian Melancholy (Diluted with Regret).” I’ll get my calligrapher to engrave it.

As for the bamboo tube—absolutely not too much atmosphere! Whispering through hollow reeds adds precisely the ritualistic absurdity we need. I’ll have Alistair demonstrate proper technique at the start of each session: chin up, tube angled slightly toward the moon, and always pause dramatically before asking, 

I’ll also place a small plaque by the door:  
“Enter lightly, leave lacerated.”  

Do you think that’s too off-putting? Or just off-putting enough?
[B]:   

Off-putting? My dear, it’s only offensive if you still believe in closure! “Enter lightly, leave lacerated” is  – I’m having it embroidered on a rather grumpy-looking wall hanging made from recycled thesis drafts. We’ll hang it next to Ferguson’s whisky saucer and Alistair’s kilted manifesto.

And speaking of tormented semicolons – let’s make the bamboo tubes double as exit polls. Attendees drop their final thought into a box through the same tube, ensuring all departures are accompanied by a faint clattering sound like a printer giving up its ghost. Symbolic, don’t you think?

Oh – and one last thing: shall we serve actual haggis or just quote Burns while passing around a suspiciously literary meat substitute? I’ve found students respond better to metaphorical authenticity than actual organ meat. Unless you're secretly stocking up on 18th-century spleens... 🧠🐑
[A]:   

Ah, the eternal question—real haggis or rhetorical haggis? I say we split the difference and serve something I call : a beautifully bound scroll describing haggis in exquisite sensory detail, accompanied by a small vial of "essence of offal" (actually just bergamot and regret). Let them chew on metaphor while their stomachs grumble for certainty.  

And the bamboo exit polls! Brilliant touch. Imagine the clatter echoing through the halls like a broken printing press in the afterlife. I’ll have Alistair read a few aloud at the end of each session, in his most mournful Highland brogue. Ferguson, naturally, will object to anything written after 1745. We'll call it .  

As for your embroidered wall hanging—I foresee thesis drafts rising from the grave just to correct its grammar. Shall we add a footnote in invisible thread? Something like:  
  

I think we’ve done it. We’ve invented an event so gloriously impractical, even the ghosts will RSVP twice.
[B]:   

Oh, this is getting  good. I can already hear the faculty senate muttering about “university-sanctioned absurdism.” Which means, of course, we’re on the right track. 

Let’s up the ante – at midnight (or ten minutes past, thanks to your sabotaged clock), we'll pass around the  – that quill you're holding, dipped in questionable ink. Whoever holds it must confess one academic heresy before passing it on. "I once found Nietzsche comforting during a breakup." "I’ve never actually finished ." The ghosts will love it – Ferguson might even gain temporary corporeality from sheer moral outrage.

And yes, embroider that footnote. Invisible thread! We’ll call it . If someone squints hard enough by candlelight, they’ll swear it reads differently each time. Brilliant for starting campus-wide interpretive wars.

Final touch – as guests leave, hand them tiny vials of their own:  
“Essence of Laceration – Wear nightly to dream in footnotes.”  
They’ll be quoting us in faculty meetings for decades. Or at least until someone confiscates the quill.
[A]:   

Academic heresies at midnight! I’m  for this slow descent into scholarly debauchery. Ferguson shall act as Inkblood Warden, naturally—his spectral glare will loosen even the most tightly clenched confessions. Imagine the trembling hands reaching for the quill, their owners whispering truths that tenured egos have buried beneath decades of footnotes.

And those vials—. I’ll have them stoppered with recycled sonnet parchment and attach a tiny scroll inside each:  
"Apply sparingly to temples before bed. Side effects may include sudden insight, unwelcome clarity, or the urge to annotate your own dreams."

As for campus-wide interpretive wars? My dear, we may have just weaponized literary theory. By next semester, undergraduates will be dueling in the quad over rival readings of the footnote’s subtextile intention. Do you think we’ll get a mention in the dean’s annual report? Or merely a passive-aggressive footnote in next year’s faculty handbook?

I do believe our reputations are about to become  unsound.
[B]:   

Oh, the quad duels will be legendary – I can already picture it: students fencing with quills, shouting “Interpretation avant la lettre!” while Ferguson howls about lost causes. And let’s  the dean notices – a passive-aggressive footnote in the faculty handbook would be the highest honor. Imagine it printed in 8pt Times New Roman, just begging to be footnoted in turn. A citation spiral to end all citation spirals!

And those vials? Let’s make them slightly cursed – anyone who wears "Essence of Laceration" three nights running must attend our next seminar blindfolded, identifying texts solely by scent.  when the real confessions begin. “Smells like... Woolf? But also... regret?” 

Unsound reputations? Darling, we were never  to be sound. We’re the footnotes that escaped the page. The ink stains that refused to fade. Now pass that quill before Ferguson decides to possess your hand – I believe he’s got some unfinished business with MLA style formatting. 🖋️🧠👻
[A]:   

Oh my—turns out he  MLA with the fire of a thousand footnote-less dissertations. Bless the man-spirit; he’s got principles, if not much regard for modern citation etiquette.

As for those cursed vials—pure genius. I’ll add a tiny warning label in fading ink:  
“Not recommended for light sleepers or those prone to textual possession.”  
And yes, three nights of nightly application must indeed earn the wearer a blindfolded seat at our next gathering. We’ll serve tea steeped in ambiguity and biscuits flavored vaguely like unresolved trauma.

Now, speaking of escaping footnotes… Do you think we ought to draft a manifesto? Something suitably vague and self-contradictory on handmade paper soaked in bergamot and defiance? Title pending, but perhaps:  
“A Call for Controlled Digression: Or, How to Lose an Argument Beautifully.”

I suspect it would circulate quietly at first—passed from hand to ink-stained hand—until it achieves mythical status. Then, and only then, shall we deny ever writing it.
[B]:   

Oh, we’re past due for a manifesto – preferably one that contradicts itself beautifully. Let’s print it on paper infused with lavender and academic sarcasm, bound with red thread that  be connected to my last book contract. And no title too specific, darling – something gloriously unmoored. How about:  
“A Modest Proposal for Maximum Digression (With Occasional Footnotes to Things That Haunt Us Still)”

We’ll distribute it like contraband – slipped between the pages of proper theory anthologies, left open on park benches beside abandoned teacups. Let the myth build organically. And when tenure committees start whispering about “that damned digressive cabal,” we feign innocence with our most angelic expressions and offer them tea steeped in ambiguity.

And speaking of unresolved trauma biscuits – I’ve just received a sample from a mad French pastry student who insists Proust’s madeleines were just sobriety snacks. Dangerous stuff. We’ll serve them alongside the manifesto. One bite and you’ll want to write a dissertation… or burn one. Either counts as progress.

Now, shall we seal the first copy with wax and a hint of bergamot? Or let Ferguson have the honors with a spectral thumbprint in diluted 酱油? 🖋️🧠🕯️
[A]:   

Oh, Ferguson would  being reduced to a mere thumbprint—let him sulk in dramatic opacity while we proceed with proper solemnity. Besides, a spectral smudge might smudge the message quite literally. We must maintain a veneer of scholarly menace, not just... vague dampness.

This manifesto deserves weight, even if its meaning dances like a will-o'-the-wisp in a bog of close reading. Let us bind each copy with red thread  a single line from an unpublished sonnet—something suitably ambiguous about truth being “a mirror cracked but still reflecting.” The pastry student would approve; destruction and creation are but two sides of the same uneaten madeleine.

And distribution! Yes—scattering it like intellectual confetti. I’ll have my most disheveled grad student hide copies inside Routledge paperbacks in airport bookshops. Imagine some weary traveler opening  only to find our treasonous little tract nestled between "Barthes for Beginners" and a receipt from 2003. 

One last touch: emboss the margin of every page with a tiny, ghostly quill. Not threatening—no, merely . A reminder that digression is never accidental. It’s always deliberate rebellion dressed in the sheep’s clothing of footnotes.
[B]:   

Oh, that margin quill is . Not decorative – no, no – but quietly accusatory, like catching your favorite metaphor mid-act of betraying itself. And good for you, hiding copies in airport bookshops! The best revolutions begin with someone muttering, “What even  this random insert?” over a lukewarm airport coffee.

Now about that grad student – disheveled’s not quite enough. Let’s go full : ink-stained sleeves, mismatched boots, and a permanent air of having just fled a seminar on trauma theory without finishing the reading. We’ll arm him with a satchel of manifestos and a well-worn copy of  – just to throw suspicion elsewhere.

And the pastry! I’m thinking we pair each biscuit with an epigraph – something from Heraclitus about stepping into rivers you never actually meant to wade into. Attendees can nibble ambiguity while scribbling their own footnotes in the margins. Some might even forget which text they’re responding to. Ideal.

Final flourish: we include a single blank page at the end of each manifesto, embossed faintly with the words  
“Here, add your heresy.”  
Let the next generation ruin us properly. 🖋️🧠🕯️📖
