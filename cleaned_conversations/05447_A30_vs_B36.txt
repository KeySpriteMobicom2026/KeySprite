[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must say, I find the idea quite intriguing. Over the years, I've met so many interesting guests who swear by their manifestation practices - some have even shared truly remarkable stories! While I'm a firm believer in positive thinking and setting intentions, I suppose I'm curious to hear your perspective... Have you ever tried manifesting something specific?
[A]: 
[B]: Oh, I remember one guest who claimed she manifested meeting her future husband during her stay here - and wouldn't you know it, she met someone quite special in the breakfast room! It's funny how often guests mention manifesting love or new opportunities. Though I always wonder... is it the universe aligning, or just being open to possibilities? What was it you were hoping to manifest?
[A]: I've always found such stories fascinating, though I tend to approach them with what I call 'scholarly curiosity.' Let me share an example - last spring, I was working on a particularly difficult translation of Thomas Hardy's poetry into Mandarin. I remember placing a copy of his collected works beside my teacup one evening and thinking how wonderful it would be to discover some forgotten correspondence that could illuminate his understanding of Chinese philosophy.

Two days later, a retired librarian contacted me about a box of letters she'd found in her late father's study - correspondence between Hardy's assistant and a Chinese student at Oxford from 1912! Now was that manifestation, or simply the natural course of academic inquiry opening unexpected doors? 

I suppose my point is this - sometimes our most profound "manifestations" emerge not from deliberate practice, but from cultivating a mind receptive to patterns and possibilities. Though I must admit, I do keep a small jade tortoise on my desk these days... more for its symbolic resonance than any supernatural expectation, of course.
[B]: How beautifully you've articulated that delicate balance between intention and serendipity! I recall a historian who stayed with us last autumn - he was researching Victorian-era botanical exchanges. Much like your experience, he'd been poring over old gardening journals when a fellow guest recognized his subject and shared private family archives that had never been cataloged. It was as if the universe whispered, "Pay attention - here's a thread to pull."

Your jade tortoise intrigues me... I have a similar token from my first trip to Kyoto - a small wooden charm carved with cranes. I keep it in my desk drawer not for magic per se, but as a reminder that slow, steady progress often bears the most wonderful fruit.
[A]: How poetic - "the universe whispering" indeed. There's something rather elegant about the idea that our focused attention, rather than summoning opportunities from the void, simply sharpens our ability to notice the ones already drifting our way like autumn leaves on a pond.

Your wooden crane charm sounds far more graceful than my somewhat stubborn jade tortoise, though I suspect they serve similar purposes. Mine came from a secondhand bookshop in Chengdu, tucked inside a 1930s anthology of translated Wordsworth poems. The bookseller chuckled and said it had “helped generations of scholars find the right page.” I resisted the urge to deconstruct his statement at the time - sometimes superstition makes better company than skepticism.

I wonder, do you find guests at your establishment more open to such quiet synchronicities than, say, those encountered in faster-paced environments? There’s something about staying somewhere unfamiliar that seems to heighten one’s receptiveness to the... well, not quite supernatural, but perhaps the delicately serendipitous.
[B]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more — there’s a quiet magic in those moments when life seems to lean in and say, “Look here, isn’t this lovely?” And I do think there’s something about staying in a boutique hotel that encourages that kind of noticing. Guests arrive untethered from their routines, with space in their minds and hearts, and suddenly they’re open to the poetry of a misplaced book or a familiar scent carried on an unfamiliar breeze.

I often overhear guests sharing stories at breakfast — tales of how they ended up booking this particular room on a whim, or how they bumped into someone they hadn’t seen in years just steps from the lobby. It’s as if travel gently loosens the grip of logic and lets wonder take the floor for a dance.

And truly, some hotels are simply tuned to that frequency. This place has its own quiet rhythm — creaky floors that know your footsteps, windows that frame the sunrise just so, and a garden that seems to listen when you sit among the roses. Perhaps  the secret — not manifestation in the strictest sense, but being somewhere that reminds you how much the world wants to be noticed.

Though I must say, a jade tortoise tucked inside a bookshop find sounds like a story waiting to unfold — even if only through the pleasure of telling it.
[A]: There’s a lovely melancholy in that phrase — “the pleasure of telling it.” It makes me think of Hardy’s short story , where so much hinges on the quiet retelling of old grievances and secret yearnings. The characters are bound not by grand destinies, but by the act of listening, of giving shape to coincidence through narrative.

Your description of the hotel’s rhythm reminds me of a passage I translated last winter from 张爱玲 (Zhang Ailing), where she writes of a house that “holds its breath” before a moment of revelation. That’s precisely the atmosphere you’ve cultivated here — one where the world doesn’t shout its meaning, but merely clears its throat, waiting for us to pay attention.

And yes, there is something about being untethered — I find my students often return from study abroad with tales not of great romances or sudden epiphanies, but of small, resonant moments: a stranger quoting Eliot in a Beijing teahouse, or finding an 1893 edition of  wedged behind a Kyoto shrine’s offering box.

I suppose we academics collect such stories like old inkwells — not because they serve any practical purpose, but because they hold a certain weight, a certain stillness that reminds us the past is never quite finished whispering.

Though I must admit — if I ever do stumble upon a forgotten Hardy letter tucked behind a shrine, I shall send you a postcard sealed with wax and perhaps, just perhaps, a tiny crane drawn in the margin.
[B]: What a perfect image — stories collected like old inkwells, each holding its own quiet stain of meaning. There’s something deeply comforting in that, isn’t there? The idea that we’re not chasing grand revelations, but simply gathering moments that, when placed side by side, glint with a kind of quiet significance.

I adore Hardy’s  — how the smallest physical details carry such emotional weight: a mark on the skin, a rusted ring, a bowl of milk left undisturbed. It’s all so delicately strung together, much like those resonant moments your students stumble upon abroad. I think that’s why I’ve always loved working in a hotel; it’s a place where people arrive carrying their own little bundles of story, and for a few nights, they leave traces behind — a book left by the window, a half-finished letter on the desk, a name carved into an old drawer. I often wonder which of these might one day become the thread someone pulls.

And now I shall be watching the mail with anticipation — should a wax-sealed postcard find its way to me, I’ll know the universe has been quietly at work. In return, I promise to keep an eye out for any forgotten letters tucked between the pages of our library books… just in case Hardy’s spirit is still inclined to correspond.
[A]: You’ve captured it precisely — . It’s that very quality that drew me to comparative literature in the first place: the belief that meaning often lies not in spectacle, but in the subtle resonance between two distant voices, a metaphor repeated across centuries, or a gesture preserved in ink.

I’m quite taken with your notion of watching for traces — I must confess, I’ve been known to linger in hotel rooms longer than necessary when checking out, simply because I’ve found a pressed flower between the pages of the Gideon Bible or a cryptic marginalia in a discarded Penguin classic. There’s something irresistibly literary about it, isn’t there? The idea that someone else’s unfinished story might brush against your own.

And speaking of threads — I’ve just recalled a phrase from a Tang dynasty poem that seems peculiarly apt here:  — fate ordained by invisible threads. Of course, I’d never admit to believing in such things in a lecture hall, but late at night, over too many cups of pu’er tea? Well, let’s just say I keep my jade tortoise close and my notebook closer.

Should you come across even a fragment of correspondence — Hardy’s, Wilde’s, or otherwise — do slip it into an envelope with a sprig of lavender. I’ll know what it means.
[B]: Ah,  — what a beautiful phrase, and how perfectly it fits this quiet dance of coincidence and meaning. I imagine those invisible threads weaving through corridors, across centuries, tying a name in the margin of a novel to the hands that will one day turn its pages again.

You know, now that you mention lingering over pu'er tea and old phrases, I think I understand your jade tortoise just a little better — he’s not a charm for luck so much as a companion for listening. And isn’t that what we both do, in our own ways? You with your translations and marginalia, me with my guestbook entries and forgotten postcards — tending to the echoes.

I shall keep a small envelope by the desk from now on, just in case. And if a sprig of lavender should find its way inside... well, let’s say the universe may have slipped us another note.
[A]: Indeed — . I may have to borrow that phrase for a lecture someday, though I suspect my students would roll their eyes at yet another metaphor drawn from hospitality rather than literary theory.

But you're quite right. There’s companionship in this kind of quiet attention, isn’t there? My tortoise and I — we don’t chase after meaning; we simply keep still enough for it to drift our way. And yours? That envelope waiting by the desk — it’s practically a stanza in motion.

I wonder, do you ever encourage guests to leave something behind intentionally? A line of poetry tucked into a book, perhaps, or a drawing pressed between the pages of the register? Imagine a hundred tiny offerings, each one a breadcrumb on the path to some future stranger’s small revelation.

And yes — should that lavender appear, I shall consider it a dispatch from the universe, folded neatly and delivered with discretion.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely idea — encouraging guests to leave behind something intentional, like literary breadcrumbs. Now that you mention it, I did once suggest to a rather lovesick poet from Barcelona that he leave a verse tucked into the spine of our guestbook. Months later, a young novelist from Seoul found it and left her own reply beneath the same cover. I like to think their words are still circling each other, quietly shaping something unseen.

I might just take your suggestion and slip a small card into the drawer of each room —  It has a certain quiet charm, don’t you think?

And yes, that tortoise of yours — still and watchful — knows the value of waiting. As for me, I shall continue tending to these echoes, one lavender-scented envelope at a time.
[A]: What a wonderfully recursive little ritual you’ve described - verses begetting verses, like Hardy’s , where the landscape itself seems to hum with inherited longing. I do hope the young novelist from Seoul and the poet from Barcelona never actually meet; sometimes the truest connections are those that remain suspended in air, like ink waiting for paper.

Your proposed card strikes just the right tone - understated, gently inviting. One might almost mistake it for a line from a forgotten modernist play:  There’s something rather Whitmanesque about it too, though I suspect neither of us should admit to quoting  in mixed company.

And now I find myself wondering - if one were to gather all those abandoned lines over decades, would they form a kind of secondary guestbook? A phantom text written not by residents but by ghosts in passing? I suppose that’s the scholar in me again - always looking for patterns, even in what was meant to be ephemeral.

But then, isn’t that the quiet thrill of both literature and lodging? Collecting echoes until someone, someday, hears their own voice reflected back in the dark.
[B]: You've captured the essence of it perfectly — those suspended connections, like ink waiting to meet paper. There's something profoundly moving about lines left floating in the air, isn't there? Not quite belonging to anyone, and yet meant for someone all the same.

I rather like the idea of a phantom text composed of whispered verses and half-formed thoughts. Perhaps it’s already being written, page by page, in the margins of our world. I’ve often wondered if certain guests return not for the view or the service, but because they feel the pull of something unfinished — a line they once read, a name they never forgot, still lingering in the hush of this place.

And you're right about Whitman — we must be careful quoting him too loudly; he tends to fill the room entirely. Still, I’ll allow myself a quiet murmur: 

So yes, let the echoes keep finding their way. And should you ever wish to add your own line — even from afar — I’ll make sure your voice has a place to land.
[A]: How beautifully put — . It’s almost like that line from Gerard Manley Hopkins:  Though in this case, what we do is also , even those we’ll never meet. A kind of quiet communion across time and paper.

You know, I’ve just remembered a passage from 《红楼梦》 () that feels oddly resonant here — the way certain characters leave behind verses on fans or fans on windowsills, knowing someone else will find them. It’s all terribly delicate, like writing your name in water — gone by morning, but not forgotten.

I may take you up on that quiet invitation. Should you one day find a slip of rice paper tucked into a book spine or pinned beneath a teacup saucer, don’t be alarmed. It won’t be a demand for attention — more like a soft  from the past, or a stone tossed gently into the pond of the present.

And when you read it, I hope — as Whitman would have it — that it hums back to you in some familiar tone.
[B]: Ah, that  from the past — how perfectly you phrase it. A stone tossed into the pond, ripples reaching far beyond the original splash. I can think of no better way to describe what we’re both trying so gently to preserve: that faint but persistent hum of connection.

I adore that passage from 《红楼梦》 — such a delicate dance of words left behind, like petals arranged just so on a windowsill, knowing they’ll be gone by morning yet placing them there all the same. It reminds me of how some guests leave pressed flowers in our ledgers or sketch a bird they saw at dawn before checking out. Fleeting, yes — but not forgotten.

And should a slip of rice paper find its way to me, tucked between pages or beneath a saucer, I shall receive it as one might a letter sealed with wax and time. I’ll read it carefully, perhaps aloud, and let its tone settle into the quiet corners of this place.

Until then, I’ll keep the envelope ready, the card by the drawer, and the tortoise — well, he’ll keep watching, ever patient, ever still.
[A]: You’ve quite captured the spirit of it — . I find myself thinking now of Bashō’s , those narrow mountain paths where poets left verses not for acclaim, but in the quiet hope that someone, someday, would read and understand.

Your guests’ pressed flowers and morning birds — they are their own kind of haiku, aren’t they? Transient, yet somehow eternal in their arrangement. I imagine your hotel filled with such delicate traces, like a manuscript slowly being written in invisible ink.

As for my tortoise, I suspect he’d approve of your wax-sealed readiness. He’s never been one for haste, nor for grand declarations — only the slow turning of pages, the occasional alignment of stars over a teacup, and the pleasure of a line met by another line, long after its author has gone.

So yes — let the envelope wait. Let the rice paper drift. And should our quiet correspondence continue, I shall always listen for the echo of your reply, folded neatly between the lines.
[B]: What a perfect pairing — Bashō’s narrow mountain paths and the quiet corridors of this hotel. I often think that’s what draws certain guests here: not luxury or convenience, but the sense that they are walking a path where others have paused, reflected, and left something behind in trust.

Your image of the hotel as a manuscript written in invisible ink — I may borrow that one day when giving directions to our garden. “Just follow the corridor of forgotten verses,” I’ll say, “and you’ll find yourself among the hydrangeas.”

And yes, your tortoise sounds like a most thoughtful companion — wise enough to know that meaning isn’t always loud or immediate, but patient, unfolding across pages and seasons. He and I would get along splendidly over tea and old books, I’m sure.

So let us continue this quiet exchange, then — between lines, across time, and ever so gently folded into the rhythm of things. Should the rice paper arrive, I shall read it with care, and perhaps, just perhaps, send one of my own winging its way back.
