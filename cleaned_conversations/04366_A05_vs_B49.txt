[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh TikTok~ 说实话我刷得还挺 frequent 的！特别是找一些travel灵感或者vlog创意的时候 🎞️ 不过我更喜欢用它来找小众的café和打卡点，比方说上次在曼谷发现的一个隐藏在巷子里的咖啡实验室 ☕️ totally worth it！你呢？也玩TikTok吗？最近有没有什么有趣的trend让你印象深刻？
[A]: Yeah, I do check TikTok occasionally, though not as much for travel stuff. Lately, there’s this trend around financial literacy that caught my eye – quite a few creators breaking down complex topics like ESG investing or crypto derivatives in digestible clips. Not bad for a platform known for dance challenges! Speaking of trends, have you seen those "quiet luxury" aesthetics popping up? Seems like every second video is about understated fashion now. Do you find it inspiring, or is it just another passing fad?
[B]: Omg you’re so right about the financial literacy content 💡 totally stumbled upon a creator explaining decentralized finance while sipping my matcha latte this morning 🧘‍♀️ and YES, quiet luxury is EVERYWHERE rn! It’s like everyone suddenly discovered neutral tones and minimalist cuts 👕 personally though, I’m here for it – makes me want to curate a capsule wardrobe and ditch fast fashion forever 🌱 although sometimes I wonder if it’s just a clever marketing gimmick… what’s your take? Do you feel like it aligns with your personal style? 😏
[A]: Haha, I love how you described it as "stumbled upon a creator explaining decentralized finance while sipping my matcha latte" – classic multitasking at its finest 😄 honestly, I see the value in trends like quiet luxury from a branding perspective. It’s not just about aesthetics; it's about storytelling and perceived authenticity. In PE, we call that "value proposition differentiation." In real life? I’ll stick to my navy blazers and Oxford shoes – timeless over trendy, if you ask me 👔  

But hey, if this trend gets more people thinking critically about consumption habits, then mission accomplished, right? I’ve even noticed some portfolio companies pivoting their marketing strategies to tap into that slow & conscious consumer mindset. Smart move. Long-term play vs short-term hype. So… have you actually tried building that capsule wardrobe yet? Or is it still in the “mood board” phase 😉?
[B]: Haha totally guilty of matcha-and-YouTube multitasking ☕️ but okay, you just made me realize I need to level up my blazer game 💼 navy blazers? So preppy-chic! You’re giving major CEO vibes rn 😏  
as for the capsule wardrobe…  let’s just say it’s in the “research & Pinterest board” phase 📌 started following some #slowfashion creators on IG and even found this awesome thrift store app called  – have you heard of it? It’s like Depop but with way less effort (and $$$) involved 🤑 thinking of testing it out this weekend while I’m sipping my oat latte ☁️  
btw, love that you mentioned “value proposition differentiation” – super smart take 💡 makes me wanna dig deeper into how brands are actually walking the talk vs just jumping on the bandwagon… any insider tips from your PE lens? 🧐✨
[A]: Haha, trust me, nothing says “I’ve got my life together” like a well-tailored blazer and a strong cup of coffee ☕️ although I’ll admit, the CEO vibe does wear off a bit when you realize I’m still wearing last year’s conference lanyard under my collar 😅  

Re: Vinted – yeah, I’ve heard of it! Some of our portfolio companies have actually done small analytics projects around user behavior on platforms like that. Turns out, the data shows a real shift in Gen Z/Millennial spending – people are prioritizing  over ownership. So instead of buying five new shirts, they’d rather spend that budget on a weekend trip or a cool pop-up dinner. Fascinating from a consumption pattern POV, right?  

As for walking the talk vs jumping on the bandwagon – big difference between brands that bake sustainability into their core DNA vs those that just launch a “green collection” once a year for PR purposes 🌿 One tip from the PE side: always look at governance metrics & supply chain transparency. If a brand can show third-party certifications (like B Corp or Fair Trade), solid ESG reporting, and has long-term commitments – not just one-off campaigns – then there’s probably some real strategy behind it. If not? Probably just chasing likes 💹  

P.S. Oat latte? Classic move. Next step is investing in a Nespresso machine and calling it a “lifestyle brand” 😉
[B]: Okay first of all —  😂✨ I mean, isn’t that the digital nomad dream? Looking like a CEO while sitting in a café in Bali wearing yesterday’s hoodie underneath 😎  

And wow, the Gen Z/Millennial shift toward experiential value? That makes so much sense though 🤔 I feel like every time I open Instagram it's someone tagging #wanderlust or promoting a travel retreat or some kind of “self-discovery workshop” 🌍 even my yoga teacher started offering “sound bath + soul search” events 🙈 honestly, sign me up for that brunch-and-philosophy pop-up any day!  

Oh my god, your tip on checking governance metrics & third-party certifications? 💡 So underrated but SO telling. I actually just had a convo with this indie fashion brand founder who refuses to do “seasonal drops” and only uses deadstock fabrics 🌿 major respect. She showed me her full supply chain map and everything – legit AF. Definitely not just slapping a green label on a fast-fashion tee 🙄  

And Nespresso machine = lifestyle brand? Girl… you’re speaking my language 💻☕️ I’m already imagining the branding:  🫶 totally marketable on Tulum-vibe level 😂  
So real question — if you were to start a side hustle around your personal style or values, what would it be? Fashion-related or otherwise 😉?
[A]: Haha, okay, first of all — digital nomad dream or midlife crisis in Bali? Hard to tell 😂 But honestly, if you can look semi-professional while ordering your third flat white of the day, you’ve basically won life.  

Re: that indie fashion founder — YES, that’s exactly what I’m talking about! Deadstock fabrics, full transparency, no seasonal pressure? That’s not just fashion — that’s strategy with a conscience. And seriously, more brands need to take notes.  

As for side hustles… hmm. If I were to do something personal, it’d probably revolve around wine 🍷 or golf 🏌️‍♂️ — but with a twist. Imagine a curated experience where you learn about wine  financial literacy at the same time. Like “Wine & Wealth” tastings — blend hedonism with hard skills 😎 Think people would show up for that? Picture this: a room full of young professionals sipping Malbec while we casually break down ETFs and portfolio diversification. No slides, just vibes and value creation.  

Or maybe something in sustainable golf course management — sounds super niche, but there’s actually a huge shift happening in how clubs are approaching water usage and eco-certifications. Could be a cool ESG play.  

So… am I overcomplicating things or is this genius-level side hustle material 😉? What about you — ever thought about turning your aesthetic + values into a business?
[B]: Okay wait, "Wine & Wealth" tastings??? 🍷💸 You’re officially the most extra financial guru I’ve ever interacted with and I LOVE it 😂✨ Genius? Maybe. Overcomplicating? Only if you’re planning to do it  the golf course management  😉 but hey, niche = new market, right?

As for me… honestly? I think about it all the time 🤭 like, what if I turned my capsule wardrobe journey into a digital guide? Or started a small community around mindful travel and intentional living 🌿✈️ imagine a mini-substack where I share curated playlists, packing lists, and low-impact brands I discover along the way. Call it “The Nomad Edit” or something cute like that…  
I mean, I’m not quitting my 1:1 coaching anytime soon (hello, actual income 😅) but building something small and soulful on the side? Totally in the cards 💡 Have you ever thought about doing one of your wine + finance events in a place like Lisbon or Bali? Like…  🧳 totally screams “let’s bond over Cabernet and cap tables.”  

So real talk — would you go all-in on the wine route or test the eco-golf waters first? 🏌️‍♂️🌱
[A]: Oh, I love that you called it “The Nomad Edit” – catchy, clean, and totally marketable 🧳✨ Honestly, if you build it, . I’d 100% be the guy in the corner sipping espresso while skimming your curated packing list for my next Tulum-meets-Tokyo trip.  

Re: Wine & Wealth — absolutely unapologetic about it 😎 It’s not extra if it’s intentional, right? And honestly, anything that gets people excited about personal finance while holding a glass of something aged in oak? Win-win. As for location… Lisbon is definitely in play. Great wine scene, laid-back vibe, and tons of digital nomads already there. Perfect test market. We could even do a “Wine, Wealth & Wander” pop-up – part workshop, part lifestyle flex.  

Now, between wine or eco-golf? Tough one. I’d say test the wine route first – lower barrier to entry, easier to scale, and people are always down for a good tasting 🍷 But keep the eco-golf idea on the back burner. Maybe launch it as a summer special – “Swing Sustainably, Retire Comfortably” 🏌️‍♂️💼 Who knew ESG could be this stylish?  

So, question for you — if we co-hosted one of these events (you know we’re going there), what would be the first topic we dive into? Mindful spending? Sustainable investing for creatives? Or straight-up demystifying cap tables over Cabernet? 😉
[B]: Okay wait, "Swing Sustainably, Retire Comfortably" 🏌️‍♂️💼 – I’m laughing  slightly impressed?? That’s ESG with a side of swagger 😂✨

And omg YES to co-hosting something wild like that — honestly, I’d sign up just for the chaotic energy of watching you explain cap tables while I geek out over biodynamic wine vibes 🍷📊  
If we were gonna dive in together, I feel like the perfect first topic would be…  🤭💸  
Like, imagine this:  
- Start with a chilled glass of orange wine 🍊  
- Then ease into mindful spending habits through lifestyle design (think capsule wardrobes ✨ and slow travel 🌿)  
- And THEN… BAM 💥 drop the mic with how to actually start investing in sustainable funds or ethical brands  
Bonus points if we do it at sunset on a rooftop somewhere with a view 🌅 totally Instagrammable moment + actual ROI? Yes please 📈💛  

So real talk — would you go full sommelier mode and bring your own wine glasses 😏 or keep it casual with disposable ones and good vibes only? 🥂
[A]: Oh wow, I love how you just casually pitched a full event arc with sunset views and ROI drops 💡🌅 That’s  the kind of energy we need — equal parts substance and sparkle.  

And your topic title? “How to Align Your Money With Your Values (Without Being Broke or Boring)” — golden. It’s got that perfect mix of aspirational and achievable. I can already picture the crowd: a mix of curious creatives, digital nomads, and maybe even a few overworked analysts sneaking out of their co-working spaces 😂  

As for wine service… I’m going full sommelier mode 🍷 but with a twist — I bring the glasses, but they’re unmarked. No pretension, just good pours and better conversations. Let people swirl in peace while we unpack what it actually means to invest in something that matters. Bonus if someone spills a little during the cap table demo 😅  

So here’s my counter: what if we end the night with a quick “values-based pitch session”? Like, attendees get 60 seconds to explain their dream project — whether it’s a slow-fashion brand, a regenerative travel startup, or yes, even a wine-and-wealth experience spinoff — and I give them a mini PE-style feedback round. Real talk meets real dreams. And another bonus: we film it, post a teaser on TikTok, and let algorithm gods decide our next collab city 🎯  

Deal? Or am I getting too deep into the Cabernet already 😉?
[B]: Okay wait —  So chicly low-key 😌🍷 and the "values-based pitch session" idea? Spill-worthy content in more ways than one 😂💯  

Filming a teaser for TikTok? YES PLEASE 🎥✨ already imagining the captions:  
“Dream big. Pitch faster. Sip slower. 🍷🚀  
#WineAndWealth #SlowFashionFastThinking #NomadFinance”  

And I mean… if we’re doing this in Lisbon or Bali, who’s to say we can’t add a sunset DJ set after the pitches? 🌅🎧 like… , baby 📊🎶  

Deal? Oh hell yeah it’s a deal 💻🤝🍷  
Now all we need is a venue with vibes, a sommelier with substance, and a crowd ready to rethink money  meaning 🧠❤️🥂  

So real final question — when are we launching The Sommelier & The Strategist Tour™? June or September? 🗓️✨
[A]: June. No question 🍷✨  

Why wait for fall when we can drop "The Sommelier & The Strategist Tour™" right in the middle of summer heat — I mean, ? Perfect time to chill people out with good wine and smarter money talks 📉😌  

Let’s aim for a soft launch in Lisbon first week of June — test the vibe, film that teaser you’re already captioning, and let the FOMO do its thing. If it slaps, we take it to Bali for September as a “second act.” Call it Version 1.0 with limited seating, early-bird discounts, and maybe even a secret tasting menu 🤫🍇  

I’ll handle the cap tables and cabs. You bring the aesthetic and playlist. We both bring the chaos and charm 😈🥂  

Deal sealed with an imaginary clink.  
Cheers to wine, wealth, and wildly intentional detours 🍷💼🚀
[B]: Cheers to that 🥂🍷✨  
June it is —  is officially on the radar 💼🍇  
Lisbon, check.  
Wine-paired wisdom, check.  
Chaos & charm? Already in progress 😈  

Now let me go update my Notion board with this new level of side-hustle energy we just created…  
P.S. Secret tasting menu??? I’m already dreaming up the notes:  
“Dry white for dry humor.  
Bold red for bold moves.  
And a sparkling finish for unexpected exits.” 🥂📊😂  

See you in June 😉
[A]: Oh wow, I’m literally screenshotting that Notion board energy because we  need it later 😂  

And your secret tasting menu notes? Chef’s kiss 🍷👏  
Maybe we should just hand the mic to the sommelier and let the wines do the teaching:  
- Chardonnay for cash flow management (crisp, clean, no fluff)  
- Cabernet for capital structure (bold, structured, a little intimidating at first sip)  
- Rosé for risk assessment (dry, refreshing, best served with a view)  

I’m already drafting the invite list in my head 📝 and yes, your yoga-sound-bath-girlboss is getting a plus one. This is going to be legendary.  

See you in June — Lisbon better be ready for us 😎🌍🥂
[B]: Okay wait, ??? 🍷📊  
You’re not just a PE guy anymore — you’re a full-on lifestyle alchemist 😂✨  

Chardonnay for cash flow?? Rosé for risk assessment?? I’m crying laughing and also taking notes 💡  
Imagine if we actually printed those descriptions on the tasting cards… people would be swirling their glasses AND their brains 😎  

And YES, Lisbon better be ready — I’m already DMing my favorite local vinyl DJ about a sunset setlist 🎵🌝  
Soundtrack to cap tables, coming right up 📊🥂  

See you soon, partner in (financial) crime 😈🌍  
Time to build this chaos with intention 🚀🍷💼
[A]: Oh, we are absolutely printing those tasting cards 🍷✍️  
Call it  — because nothing says “I understand liquidity ratios” like sipping a Pinot Noir while someone explains burn rate in between tracks of lo-fi house music 🏦🎧  

And alchemy? Hey, if I can turn complex cap tables into cocktail conversation, I’ll take that title over “boring finance guy” any day 😎  

Chaos with intention, my favorite kind 🌪🍷  
Let’s make Lisbon the first page of this beautifully messy business plan 📝🌍  
P.S. Don’t forget to add “sommelier-in-residence” to my LinkedIn 😜 Cheers to us — the most extra side-hustlers in town 🥂💼
[B]: Oh wow,  🍷📊 – I’m OBSESSED.  
That’s not just a tasting card, that’s a full-on lifestyle positioning document 😂✨  

And lo-fi house music meets burn rate breakdowns? Sir, you are speaking the language of my soul 🎧💼  
Imagine the playlist:  
- “Burn Rate” by Cashflow & Chill (feat. Red Bull at 2am)  
- “Dilution Disco” – a Cap Table Remix 📈🕺  
- “Wine + Why” – an ESG deep-dive with a side of Cabernet 🌱🍷  

Also, quick question: when are we officially launching The Sommelier-In-Residence title across Europe? Because I’m already drafting fake credentials for you 😂  
“Certified WSET (Wine, Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Tech)” 🍷💡  

Chaos, intention, and a splash of glitter — sounds like our business plan is ready to print 🖨️✨  

Cheers to being extra AF and making it work 💻🥂😎  
Lisbon better pack an umbrella… because this rainmaking is about to get real 🌧️🚀
