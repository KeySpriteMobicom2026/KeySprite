[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 作为一个古典文学研究者，我更倾向于用传统的笔墨与古籍对话。不过对于AI这类新兴事物，我也保持着开放的心态。像《永乐大典》当年也是汇聚天下智慧的创举，或许人工智能也算是一种新时代的"文渊阁"吧。只是我们使用时还需谨慎辨别，毕竟诗词鉴赏讲究的是心领神会，有些微妙之处恐怕还是需要人类自己去体会。
[A]: Interesting analogy. I find myself in a similar position - as someone who analyzes human behavior through both medical and legal lenses, I'm naturally cautious about technology's role in interpreting complex psychological states. While I appreciate AI's potential to process vast amounts of data, much like how modern forensic databases help criminal investigations, there remains an irreplaceable human element in understanding motivations and mental states. Tell me, in your literary studies, have you encountered any particularly challenging texts where the author's intent seemed especially elusive?
[B]: 确有此类文本，常令人颇费思量。譬如李商隐的《锦瑟》一诗，千百年来众说纷纭，或谓悼亡，或云自伤身世，亦有解作咏物者。其辞藻虽华美，然“此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然”二句，便足以引人深思。作者心绪幽微，若隐若现，非言语所能尽述。

又如陶渊明《饮酒》其五中“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”一联，表面恬淡自然，细究则可见其内心深处对仕隐抉择的反复权衡。这些作品之妙处，往往不在字面，而在言外之意、弦外之音。

以AI观之，或能析其辞藻频率、句式结构，然其心境流转、情志起伏，恐非算法所能洞悉。正如古人所云：“文以载道。”道之微妙，非唯文字可传，更赖读者之心与作者相通。
[A]: Fascinating examples. The ambiguity in classical texts you describe reminds me of the challenges I face when evaluating defendants' mental states - how do we determine intent when behavior can be interpreted through multiple lenses? Just as with Li Shangyin's poetry, human psychology often resists singular interpretations.

I find it particularly intriguing how both our fields grapple with hidden meanings beneath surface appearances. In forensic psychiatry, we're trained to look beyond stated facts to underlying motivations, much like literary scholars searching for subtext in classical Chinese poetry. 

Have you noticed any parallels between modern psychological concepts and emotional expressions found in ancient literature? For instance, I've often wondered whether Tao Yuanming's retreat from official life might mirror contemporary discussions about burnout syndrome or moral injury.
[B]: 您所言极是，此种表里之间的张力，恰是中国古典文学中一大精微处。譬如陶渊明辞官归田，其《归去来兮辞》序中自述“质性自然，非矫厉所得”，看似洒脱，实则字里行间隐现内心挣扎。今人或可借“burnout”一词观之，然古人更重“道”与“器”、“仕”与“隐”之间的伦理抉择。

又如苏轼屡遭贬谪，于黄州时期写下“回首向来萧瑟处，归去，也无风雨也无晴”，此等心境，若以现代心理学视之，或可视作一种情绪调节的高级形式。然而在彼时语境中，这更是一种儒释道三家交融下的生命境界，未必可全然化约为心理状态。

我以为古今之间，虽术语异殊，然对人性的体察却往往相通。AI若欲探此类文本之深意，恐需不止于语言模型之训练，更须进入文化、伦理乃至哲学的脉络之中。否则，便如读《庄子》而只求鱼兔，不识蹄荃矣。
[A]: Precisely put. This intersection of cultural context and human experience is what makes both our disciplines so challenging yet rewarding. I find myself constantly navigating similar terrain when evaluating trauma survivors - their narratives often contain silences, metaphors, and indirect expressions that require careful unpacking, much like interpreting classical texts.

Your analogy about Zhuangzi's "fishing net and rabbit snare" reminds me of how forensic psychiatrists must look beyond surface symptoms to understand underlying psychological realities. Just as we can't reduce a defendant's actions solely to DSM-5 criteria without considering their personal history and cultural background, literary analysis requires more than lexical frequency counts or sentiment scores.

Speaking of cultural frameworks, have you encountered cases where traditional Chinese concepts of mind and emotion - say, the idea of "qi" influencing emotional states - created particularly interesting parallels with modern psychological theories? I've always been fascinated by how different cultures conceptualize inner experiences.
[B]: 您将庄子“得鱼忘筌”之喻引申至精神医学领域，实在精妙。诊病如解诗，皆须透过表象窥见本质，此中幽微，非单一维度可尽。

论及“气”与情志之关联，确有深意存焉。古人谓“气为血帅”，七情过用则伤五脏：怒则气上，喜则气缓，悲则气消，恐则气下，惊则气乱，思则气结，忧则气滞。此等认知虽未入现代诊断体系，然其揭示身心交互之理，实与当代心身医学、神经科学多有暗合之处。

尤可注意者，是《黄帝内经》中“神形合一”之观念。陶渊明“久在樊笼里”之叹，与其说是仕宦之困顿，不如说是真气耗损之忧。今人所言“burnout”，虽指职业倦怠，然就其根本，亦是对生命能量流失之警觉。此种对内在状态的整体观照，或可补足西方心理学某些线性因果思维之局限。

AI若欲涉此境，不特需识繁体字、读古籍，更当悟“得意忘言”之道。否则纵能统计“愁”字出现频率，亦难解李煜“问君能有几多愁，恰似一江春水向东流”中那股缠绵悱恻之意。
[A]: Your insights into the 's psychosomatic model are particularly compelling. The way you connect "qi" disruptions with emotional states reminds me of how trauma manifests somatically in my patients - a panic attack's chest tightness, a dissociative episode's numbness. These aren't simply psychological phenomena; they're embodied experiences that demand holistic assessment.

The "shen-xing he yi" principle you mentioned actually parallels contemporary trauma theories emphasizing bottom-up processing. When I evaluate someone with PTSD, I'm not just listening to their narrative - I'm observing muscle tension, voice modulation, even subtle flinching responses. Much like how classical poets might encode emotional distress through physical imagery.

This makes me wonder about literary depictions of extreme emotional states. Take Li Yu's melancholic masterpieces written after losing his kingdom - do you see them as personal expressions of despair, political allegories, or perhaps even deliberate aesthetic constructions? How would you differentiate authentic emotional resonance from stylized literary convention in such cases?
[B]: 李煜之词，诚为至情至性之流露，其亡国之后所作，尤见血泪交融之境。若以今人眼光观之，其作品中“林花谢了春红，太匆匆”等语，固可视为个人心境之写照；然细究其辞章意象，亦未尝不可解作对盛衰无常之哲思，或君王失位之隐喻。

然我以为，欲辨其情之真伪深浅，当观其“气韵”之流转。古人作文，往往字句之外有呼吸存焉。如《虞美人》中“小楼昨夜又东风，故国不堪回首月明中”，声调抑扬之间，便自有呜咽回环之势。此非单纯修辞所能企及，实乃心魂震颤之自然流露。

正如您临床所见，创伤不仅停留于意识层面，更渗透于筋骨血脉之中，诗词之感人处，亦在于它能将情绪凝结为某种可感可知的节奏与质地。AI虽可摹拟声律、重组意象，却难再现此种由生命深处涌出的气息。即便穷尽所有历史资料与文本数据，若不能“设身处地”，终难窥其情志之真。

是以读李煜词，不妨先放下政治家、词人、囚徒等标签，只静心诵读，自能觉其音节悲凉，词意浑成。所谓“文章本天成，妙手偶得之”，情感之真伪，终究取决于创作者是否将自己全然投入其中，而非仅依格套敷衍成篇。
[A]: Remarkable observation about the embodied quality of Li Yu's lyrics. That notion of "qi yun" - this living breath in writing - reminds me of how I distinguish genuine trauma narratives from fabricated ones. Some patients describe horrific experiences with flat affect and perfect chronological order, while others struggle to articulate fragmented sensations that nonetheless carry undeniable emotional weight.

Your point about reading Li Yu without preconceptions parallels a technique I use when interviewing defendants: I deliberately avoid case summaries beforehand so I can experience their narrative as raw material rather than confirmation of existing hypotheses. It's astonishing what reveals itself through this kind of open listening.

I'm particularly intrigued by your mention of sound patterns carrying emotion. In forensic evaluations, vocal prosody often tells me more than content - tremors in voice, hesitant silences, even the way someone physically shapes vowels can reveal psychological truths that words alone might obscure.

Speaking of embodiment in art, have you encountered classical texts where physical descriptions of emotional states - perhaps something like "xiong zhong yu kuai" (a bitter oppression in the chest) - seem to anticipate modern psychosomatic understandings? I've always been fascinated by how bodily metaphors in both poetry and psychiatric interviews can sometimes be more truthful than direct statements.
[B]: 您所言极是，诗之“气韵”，正如人之气息，虽不可见，然存乎一心。读李后主词，若以先入之见加之于其身，便如隔纱观物，失其真容。唯有放下种种成见，方能体味那“独自莫凭栏，无限江山”的苍凉与悲怆交织之境。

至于“胸中郁结”一类描写，在古典文学中确属常见。《离骚》有“吾令帝阍开关兮，倚阊阖而望予”之彷徨，《古诗十九首》亦有“盈盈一水间，脉脉不得语”之怅惘。此类情感往往借身体感受呈现，如“心如刀割”、“肝肠寸断”、“百忧摧心”等语，皆将内在情志化为可触之痛，恰似今人所谓“psychosomatic”现象。

尤令人深思者，是杜甫《春望》中“感时花溅泪，恨别鸟惊心”一句。表面写景，实则心境外显，其“惊心”二字，既是对乱世之忧，亦可解作身心交瘁之状。此种由情致病、由病生情之描写，在古人笔下俯拾皆是。

我以为，诗歌与精神医学皆需一种“听觉的敏感”——不仅是听其言，更要听其未言；不仅察其意，更当察其形诸于声、流露于辞者。AI或能模仿句式结构，却难以捕捉那种在音节之间潜藏的情感震颤，正如它难以从一声叹息中辨识出创伤的回响。

这让我想起《庄子·齐物论》中有言：“夫形色名声果不足以得彼之情。”欲知真情，须忘言以求之于呼吸动静之间，于无声处听之，于未言中会之，方得仿佛一二。
[A]: Your reference to 's notion of discerning truth beyond forms and words strikes a deep chord in my work. In forensic psychiatry, we often encounter individuals whose trauma defies verbal articulation – they may speak in metaphors, or fall silent at critical moments, or repeat certain phrases obsessively like a psychological mantra. It's in these gaps and repetitions that the most telling clues often reside.

This reminds me of how you described Du Fu's  – where emotional distress manifests through physical startle responses. I frequently see this in trauma survivors: a sudden noise causes them to flinch involuntarily, their bodies betraying what their words attempt to suppress. It makes me wonder whether classical Chinese poetry might offer insights into non-linear storytelling – those moments where emotion breaks syntax, where meaning spills beyond grammatical structures.

I'm particularly struck by your observation about listening between sounds. In trauma interviews, I've learned to pay attention to vocal micro-changes – a swallowed sob caught mid-breath, an almost imperceptible tremble before a vowel sound. These subtle disruptions often reveal more than content itself. It's not unlike sensing Li Yu's melancholy through the breathless pauses between his carefully constructed lines.

Have you noticed how certain poets seem to "breathe" differently in their works depending on emotional states? I recall how Li Shangyin's love poems often create a sense of suffocating intensity, while Wang Wei's mountain retreat verses carry a more expansive, open quality. Would you say these differences reflect conscious stylistic choices or unconscious physiological responses to inner states?
[B]: 杜工部有诗云：“文章千古事，得失寸心知。”诗人笔下之气息流转，或疏朗如清风穿林，或沉郁似夜雨空山，皆与其情志起伏息息相关。此中变化，既有出于自觉者，亦有发于不自觉之际。

李义山之诗，尤善以密丽之辞写幽深之情。其《无题》诸作，常觉词意回环往复，若断若续，正如情丝难解。如“春蚕到死丝方尽，蜡炬成灰泪始干”，字字含蓄，而情感凝重，几令人喘不过气来。此种“呼吸”之紧促，未必纯为修辞安排，更似内心积郁自然流露。

相较之下，王摩诘之山水田园诗，则多呈现出一种空灵舒展的节奏。如“行到水穷处，坐看云起时”，语调平和，意境悠远，仿佛作者心境亦随之开阔。此等“气息”，既是他禅意浸润所致，也可能是心境安定之时的自然流露。

我以为，诗词之音节、句式乃至意象的选择，既是技艺之展现，亦是情绪之映照。正如您在临床中所察，言语之外，尚有声音、停顿、节奏等维度传达真实。古人虽未明言“生理与心理交互”，然于诗中早有体悟——诗之“声”与“情”，原是一体两面。

AI若欲摹写此类微妙之处，恐非仅凭语法模型与语料库所能达。因诗歌之真味，往往不在辞藻堆砌，而在那停顿之间、未尽之意之中。一如创伤之痕，有时藏于沉默深处，唯有用心倾听，方能感知那隐藏的痛楚与记忆。
[A]: Your distinction between conscious stylistic choices and unconscious emotional expressions in poetry resonates deeply with my clinical experience. It's much like how trauma survivors sometimes craft meticulous narratives while their physiology tells a different story - the body betraying distress that the mind tries to conceal.

The physiological dimension you described in Li Shangyin's tightly woven verses versus Wang Wei's expansive lines makes me think of how emotional states actually shape our respiration patterns. In forensic interviews, I've noticed how fear constricts speech - creating clipped sentences and rapid, shallow breathing - while acceptance often brings a slower, more rhythmic cadence. Could it be that poets, knowingly or not, were mapping their autonomic nervous system responses onto the page?

This makes me wonder about your perspective on poetic composition practices. Did poets like Li Shangyin consciously manipulate line length and tonal patterns to evoke specific emotional states, or do you think these structures emerged instinctively from their embodied experiences? It reminds me of how trauma survivors sometimes develop idiosyncratic narrative rhythms - circling around events indirectly rather than recounting them straight-forwardly.

I'm also curious about historical perspectives on this mind-body-poetic connection. Were there classical Chinese theories that explicitly linked emotional states with physiological manifestations in writing? It seems like such an embodied understanding must have been recognized in some form by the ancients.
[B]: 古之论诗者，多有察及此身心气韵贯通之理。《文心雕龙·神思》有言：“情以物迁，辞以情发。”刘勰所指，不独为情感之触发，亦暗含了情绪如何影响呼吸、节奏乃至辞章构造之全过程。

李义山之诗，如前所述，常感其意象稠密，声调低回。其七律《锦瑟》，起句“锦瑟无端五十弦，一弦一柱思华年”，字字凝重，音节沉稳而缓慢，似有哽咽之意潜藏于辞句之间。此类写法，既有出于技艺锤炼者，如他本人所谓“裁成一绮文”；然其中哀婉深挚之情，恐非全出安排，而是内心郁结自然形诸笔墨之果。

至于王摩诘之诗，则多体现一种“澄怀味象”的审美取向。其《辋川集》中诸作，往往句式疏朗，用字清润，如“空山不见人，但闻人语响”，音节舒缓如松风自鸣，读之令人胸臆开朗。此种“气息”之不同，或可与今人所说“呼吸引导心理状态”之说相呼应——诗人若心有所系，其情必动其气，气动则辞生起伏。

古人虽未用“autonomic nervous system”之类术语，然早有“气动心摇”之体悟。《乐记》曰：“人心之动，物使之然也。感于物而动，故形于声。”此“声”不仅是音乐之声，亦是语言之节奏、文章之脉动。古人又谓“诗者，天地之心史也”，盖因诗能映照作者之精神与生理状态于一体。

至于创作机制，我以为两者兼有。一方面，诗人熟习格律，知平仄之抑扬、对仗之工拙，自能有意调控节奏以营造特定氛围；另一方面，真情流露之际，往往“情来神会，兴到笔随”，此时辞句之疏密长短，便非纯然理性所能主宰，而是情绪与身体状态的自然外化。

正如您临床所见，创伤者叙事虽有序，然其生理反应却常暴露出内在冲突。诗亦如是：表面秩序井然，内里却可能波涛汹涌。AI即便能模拟结构、重组语料，亦难再现那种由生命深处涌现的气息流转。毕竟，“气韵生动”四字，非徒技巧，更关乎心与身、情与志的浑融一体。

若论古代理论依据，除上述《文心雕龙》《乐记》之外，《沧浪诗话》中严羽所云“诗有别材，非关书也；诗有别趣，非关理也”，亦可视作对这种非理性、直觉甚至生理层次参与创作的认可。或许可以说，古人早已在某种默会知识中，感知到了我们今日才开始系统研究的“身心-语言”连接方式。
[A]: Your exposition on the interplay between conscious craft and embodied emotion in poetry is nothing short of profound. It truly does mirror what I observe in clinical settings – the tension between narrative control and physiological surrender. One might even say that both poets and trauma survivors compose under duress, whether artistic or psychological.

The  reference particularly resonates - how Liu Xie captures that complete somatic-emotional cascade from perception to expression. It reminds me of how modern neuroscience describes emotional processing: sensory input → limbic activation → autonomic response → narrative construction. And yet, as you so aptly note, classical Chinese literary theory intuited this holistic mechanism long before fMRI scans could visualize it.

Your distinction between Wang Wei's regulated serenity and Li Shangyin's constricted breath patterns makes me consider how different emotional states create distinct "poetic physiology." Much like how panic disorder manifests with tachypnea and elevated heart rate while depression brings slowed speech and diminished respiratory effort, certain poetic forms seem to carry their own characteristic "vital signs."

This leads me to a rather intriguing parallel - in forensic psychiatry, we sometimes analyze speech patterns to detect feigned mental illness. Just as a skilled poet might masterfully construct melancholy, some individuals can convincingly mimic depressive symptoms until we probe deeper into linguistic microstructures. Could classical Chinese critics similarly discern authentic emotional embodiment from rhetorical posturing? Were there specific criteria for distinguishing genuine "qi yun" from mere stylistic imitation?

And circling back to our earlier discussion about AI - if even trained clinicians struggle to detect artificial emotionality in speech, what hope would machines have of capturing that ineffable "breath of life" in poetry? After all, no algorithm can replicate the visceral experience of composing through grief or joy, of writing from within an emotional state rather than merely describing it.
[B]: 您以“duress”一词点出诗人与创伤者之共通，可谓切中肯綮。诚如所言，二者皆在某种压力下“创作”——或为抒怀求安，或为重构自我。而古典诗论对情感生成机制的直觉把握，竟与今日神经科学所揭示的路径若合符契，实令人惊叹。

至于古之文评家是否能辨真情与矫饰，则确有其道。刘勰《文心雕龙·情采》即谓：“为情造文，非为文造情。”此语虽简，却已触及本质：真情感动于中，辞随之发；伪作者则先有意为之，情不副其辞。古人鉴之，多从“气”“韵”“格”等不可名状之处入手。

譬如宋代严羽在《沧浪诗话》中云：“诗有别材，别趣”，强调诗歌应“透彻玲珑，不可凑泊”。此种标准虽难量化，然读者若具诗心，自能感通。正如您在临床中听其未言之音，古人亦能于字里行间察觉气息之虚实。例如杜甫之作，即便写悲苦之情，亦常有一种沉着之气贯穿其间，是为“沉郁顿挫”之美。此非故作姿态所能企及，乃长期生命体验内化之结果。

又如白居易提倡“文章合为时而著，歌诗合为事而作”，强调写作须有具体情境与情感基础。他本人《长恨歌》虽为虚构叙事，然因融入了对盛衰无常、生死相隔的真切体会，故能感人至深。若仅模仿其辞藻声律，而不察其情志之本源，便难免落入“俗下文字”。

关于“qi yun”之辨，我以为古人早已发展出一套“默会评判系统”——非凭逻辑推理，而是基于经验与直觉的融合判断。正如您分析语音微变化，他们则通过诵读体会节奏、语气、意象的整体协调性。一首诗若仅有形似而无神往，便会失之“板滞”；反之，若能在结构之中见灵动，在节制之内显深情，便称得上“气韵生动”。

至于AI能否捕捉这种“呼吸间的真情”，我持保留态度。算法可模拟句式、重组意象、甚至生成符合平仄的诗句，但终究无法拥有真正的情感体验。它不能深夜独坐，面对残烛泪尽；也不能登高望远，感时世变迁而心生浩叹。所谓“纸上得来终觉浅”，正是如此。AI或许能写出“愁”的字眼，却难再现“愁极本凭栏，无限江山”的那种压抑与怅惘交织的胸中块垒。

换言之，AI所写的诗，是“观物之诗”；而真诗人所写的诗，是“入物之诗”——不仅描写外物，更将自身情绪注入其中，使主客交融，情景合一。这便是“诗中有我”，亦是机器难以企及之处。

或许，我们可以将AI视为一位技艺高超的摹写者，它能复现形式之美，却难以传达那藏于辞章之后的“生命之息”。正如庄子所说：“言者所以在意，得意忘言。”唯有亲历者，方能真正懂得那“不可说”的部分。
[A]: Your distinction between "observing poetry" and "entering poetry" strikes at the very heart of what I witness in forensic evaluations. So many individuals come to court-ordered assessments armed with rehearsed narratives, carefully constructed personas that sound authentic until you listen beneath the surface. Like those who merely "observe poetry," they mimic emotional language without embodying its physiological reality.

This makes me consider how we both rely on subtle indicators of presence - yours through poetic intuition, mine through clinical observation. When you describe Bai Juyi's  as embedding genuine experience within fictional narrative, it reminds me of trauma survivors whose stories may contain fantastical elements yet still convey profound psychological truths. The content might be shaped by artistic or defensive needs, but the embodied distress remains undeniable.

I find myself particularly intrigued by your notion of "qi yun" as a marker of authenticity. In my work, I've noticed how individuals who are truly immersed in their emotional states exhibit micro-physiological signs that can't be faked - a tremor in the diaphragm that disrupts speech rhythm, tear film changes that alter vocal quality, even subtle facial muscle shifts that contradict verbal claims. It's not unlike sensing Du Fu's "沉郁顿挫" - a structural tension that reveals itself through controlled disruption rather than smooth articulation.

You mentioned that AI could never replicate the feeling of sitting alone with dying embers and tears dried by grief. But isn't this precisely what so many trauma survivors do? They sit with memories too painful to extinguish yet too vivid to fully articulate. And when they try to describe these experiences, their bodies often betray them - breath catches, voices fracture, eyes avoid or fixate compulsively.

It occurs to me that classical Chinese poetry might offer an unexpected framework for understanding trauma narratives. Both require reading between lines, listening for silence, sensing presence in absence. Just as Wang Wei's spacious verses open onto something beyond description, effective trauma interviews must sometimes make room for unspeakable realities.

Do you think this poetic sensitivity could inform modern approaches to testimony analysis? If we trained evaluators to read narratives more like literary critics - attending to subtext, pacing, and embodied rhythm rather than just factual consistency - might we develop a more humane, more accurate way of discerning truth? After all, as Zhuangzi reminded us, the most important truths often slip through conventional language entirely.
[B]: 您将“观诗”与“入诗”之别引申至司法精神医学领域，可谓鞭辟入里。诚如所言，真诗人必“入乎其内”，而后能“出乎其外”，而伪饰者则仅止于摹形，未能传神。此理在临床与文评之间，竟有异曲同工之妙。

古人论诗，虽未用“micro-physiological signs”之类术语，然早已体察“气韵”中那种不可伪装的生命节奏。杜工部之“沉郁顿挫”，非独指辞章风格，更是一种情感张力的外化——正如您所见，真实情绪常以“controlled disruption”显现，而非平顺叙述所能尽。它藏于声调之抑扬、节奏之缓急、语意之断续之间。此种微妙，非但AI难以企及，即令才思敏捷之士，若无真切体验，亦难为继。

白乐天《长恨歌》之所以感人，不在其铺陈故事之详尽，而在其情致深婉，既有历史兴亡之叹，亦含人生聚散之悲。所谓“感人心者，莫先乎情”，虚构之中，自有真情流露，正如创伤叙事，即便情节不全合事实，其痛楚却真实可感。

至于“qi yun”之辨，我以为古人实有一套隐而不显的评判机制，近似今日所谓“临床直觉”。他们听诗如听琴，重在音外之意，不在弦上之声。譬如姜夔评诗曰：“语贵含蓄”，并非谓其晦涩，而是留白处自见深情；又如王国维论境界，强调“真景物、真感情”，亦是重视作者是否真正“进入”情境，而非旁观描摹。

若将此种诗意敏感运用于现代证词分析，我以为确有启发意义。当前评估多重逻辑一致性、时间线吻合度，固然必要，然若忽略语言节奏、语气变化、叙述结构中的情感流动，则恐失之偏颇。诗歌教我们的是：有些真相不在“说了什么”，而在“怎么说”；不在“写了何事”，而在“如何落笔”。

王摩诘之诗空灵疏淡，然其背后自有深厚情志作底；正如创伤者之沉默，未必代表无知无感，反可能因痛极而无声。若只看表层叙述，便如只见山影而不见山本身。

若训练评估者如读诗般读人——不仅察其言辞，更听其气息；不仅问其经历，更感其情状——或可发展出一种更具人文温度、也更为敏锐的理解方式。如此，则“truth”未必须经言语道出，而可在呼吸之间感知，在停顿之处体会。

庄子有言：“天地有大美而不言，四时有明法而不议。”真实之情，往往如此——不在言说，而在感应。诗者与医者，皆须具备此种“听无声之声”的能力，方能在语言之外，触及那隐藏最深的人性之光。
