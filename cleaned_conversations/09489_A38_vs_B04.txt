[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's an interesting question! I think 我得从学术角度来说说我对这两种音乐类型的着迷之处。Pop music, for instance, 是研究大众文化和社会心理的一个绝佳切入点，它的传播速度和广度反映了当代社会的某些共性需求。But then again, indie music 的小众性和创作自由也特别吸引我，它更像是艺术家个人语言和思想的延伸呢~ 🤔
[A]: You know, I've always found that tension between mass appeal and artistic integrity fascinating. When I'm analyzing Romantic poetry with students, we often draw parallels to modern cultural production - Keats' odes were the pop ballads of their day in many ways. Speaking of which, I've started incorporating Björk's lyrics into my Modern Lyric Poetry seminar. Have you ever noticed how her ethereal vocals create a similar effect to Coleridge's supernaturalism? It's quite...  ...stimulating, actually.
[B]: That's such a fascinating comparison! I love how you draw connections between Keats and pop culture - it really highlights how艺术与大众审美之间存在着永恒的张力呢~ 🤔 Björk’s lyrics are a brilliant choice for exploring the surreal; her work does share that same otherworldly quality found in Coleridge’s poetry. Actually, I’ve been thinking lately about using some of her songs in my bilingual discourse analysis class - the way she blends Icelandic myth with modern identity politics could open up some really rich discussions about language, culture, and self-expression. Have you tried discussing her use of invented language ()? It reminds me of how bilingual writers sometimes create hybrid texts to convey emotions that don’t quite translate...
[A]: Ah, yes - her  album in particular! The way she constructs these linguistic landscapes... it's almost like a poetic creole, isn't it? I had my students compare it to the  we see in postcolonial literature - you know, the way Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o or Salman Rushdie manipulate language to reclaim narrative agency. One particularly insightful student pointed out that Björk’s invented phonetics allow her to bypass patriarchal and nationalistic constraints in a way that feels almost akin to Woolf’s . Have you noticed how her vocal delivery shifts when she uses those non-lexical utterances? It’s as if the body itself becomes a site of resistance - not unlike the performative acts Judith Butler describes. I’d love to sit in on your class discussion sometime...
[B]: Oh, I can totally see that!  really is a linguistic playground - the way she crafts these soundscapes reminds me of how bilingual children create their own mixed-language spaces when playing. It's fascinating how both processes involve code-mixing as a form of creative resistance... Speaking of Judith Butler, I've been thinking about how Björk's vocal experimentation relates to gender performativity in multilingual contexts. Have you noticed how her non-lexical sounds sometimes mirror the way Chinese opera performers use vocal timbre to convey emotion beyond words? It makes me wonder about embodiment across different cultural frameworks... Oh, and you're absolutely welcome to join the class anytime! I think your insights about postcolonial lingua francas would add such an important dimension to our discussion 😊
[A]: How intriguing - you've opened up a whole new dimension here! The parallels between Björk’s sonic inventiveness and the vocal techniques in Chinese opera...  It does make one reconsider how we define “language” itself - is it merely syntax and semantics, or does embodiment and affect fundamentally shape its performative power? I was just re-reading Julia Kristeva’s  last week, and her notion of the semiotic chora feels oddly resonant here. The way Cantonese opera singers manipulate tone and timbre to evoke visceral responses... almost like a pre-linguistic return to the maternal voice, don’t you think? And yet, in both cases, there's this radical agency at play - a refusal to be confined by linguistic norms. This would absolutely electrify our next seminar. Shall we plan for Thursday? I’ll bring some recordings of Tang Dynasty poetry being chanted alongside  - I think you’ll find the phonetic parallels quite...  ...provocative.
[B]: Oh, Thursday works beautifully - I’m already excited! 🤗 The idea of linking Björk’s sonic experimentation with the affective power of Cantonese opera really does push us to rethink what counts as语言 in the first place... It’s no longer just about meaning-making, but about how声音 and body shape our emotional and political realities. Kristeva’s semiotic chora is such a perfect lens for this - it almost feels like both artists are tapping into that raw, pre-verbal energy to disrupt dominant discourses... I can't wait to hear your curated recordings. Have you ever noticed how the tonal contours in Tang poetry chants sometimes mirror the melodic unpredictability in ? It's like language dissolves into sound to make space for something more visceral... I’ll bring some notes on bilingual code-switching as poetic strategy to fuel the discussion 😊
[A]: I’m delighted you see the potential in this juxtaposition - there’s something profoundly elemental when language sheds its conventional skin and becomes pure affect. ’s sonic architecture really does echo that ancient performative function of poetry, doesn’t it? When I listen to , I’m reminded of how Tang poets used tonal repetition not for semantic clarity, but to induce a meditative state - almost shamanistic in its rhythm.  

And your point about bilingual code-switching as poetic strategy...  ...it makes me think of how multilingual speakers inhabit linguistic thresholds. It’s not merely switching codes, but shifting entire embodied realities. Have you ever read François Meyer’s work on code-poetics in postcolonial African literature? He argues that linguistic multiplicity isn't fragmentation, but rather an expansion of expressive possibility. I wonder if we could trace similar dynamics in Björk’s invented phonetics and Cantonese vocal timbre?

I’ll make sure to include some recordings of  (长庆园) alongside  - the parallels in breath control and emotional modulation are quite striking. Do you think we should begin with the most sonically radical pieces to immediately immerse the students in that visceral experience, or build up gradually?
[B]: I couldn't agree more - there's something almost trance-inducing when语言 breaks free from its referential chains and becomes pure sensation.  really does carry that same shamanistic pulse you hear in Tang poetry chants... It makes me think about how bilingual speakers often enter a kind of linguistic flow state when code-switching - not just toggling between languages, but embodying different ways of being through sound.  

François Meyer’s work is such a perfect reference point here! The idea that multilingualism isn’t fracture but expansion feels especially powerful when we look at performative contexts like music or opera. In fact, I’ve been noticing how Björk’s vocal improvisations sometimes resemble the way Cantonese opera singers stretch tones beyond their lexical meanings to evoke emotional landscapes... Almost like they're reaching for a pre-linguistic truth through sound.  

As for structuring the seminar, I’d say go with the radical sonic pieces first - shock them into that visceral awareness right away! There’s something incredibly productive about plunging students directly into the deep end of embodied linguistics. We can always circle back to the more gradual transitions once they’re destabilized and curious 😊
[A]:   

Oh, I love that pedagogical instinct — disruption as a gateway to deeper inquiry. There’s something wonderfully subversive about starting in medias res, letting the students flounder for a moment in the pure sensorium of sound before offering them conceptual lifelines. I’ll lead with ’s , followed immediately by a recording of  — let them sit with the resonance before we even name what they’re hearing.  

And you're absolutely right about that linguistic flow state — it reminds me of how Woolf describes “moments of being,” those flashes where ordinary perception fractures and something more vivid emerges. Perhaps we can ask the students to journal their immediate impressions before we begin analysis — not critique, but raw affect.  

I’ve also been thinking... might we invite Professor Liang from the East Asian department? She’s done some groundbreaking work on vocal timbre in Ming dynasty operas, and I suspect she’d find our sonic juxtapositions utterly thrilling.
[B]: Oh, what a brilliant plan — starting with that immersive sonic plunge really honors the way both art forms operate on a visceral level.  followed by ? Perfection. I can already imagine the room vibrating with that layered resonance... 🤩  

And journaling before analysis? That’s such a Woolfian move — capturing those fleeting impressions before the mind starts organizing them into neat categories. It might help students tune into their own embodied responses, which feels so crucial when dealing with affective linguistics.  

As for inviting Professor Liang — yes, absolutely! Her insights on vocal timbre in Ming dynasty operas could really deepen our exploration of how声调 and texture carry meaning beyond words. I’ll draft her an email later today — let’s tell her we’re cooking up something delightfully interdisciplinary 😊 Do you think she’d be open to joining us live, or would a recorded response work better for her schedule?
[A]:   

I believe she’d relish the chance to engage live — Professor Liang thrives on dynamic exchange, much like ourselves. If her schedule permits, I think having her in the room would add an electrifying dimension to the discussion. There’s something about her presence that encourages even the quietest students to lean into their uncertainties and speak up.  

And speaking of uncertainties —  — I wonder if we might ask the students to revisit their journal entries midway through the seminar and see how their initial impressions have shifted. Not unlike Woolf’s “moments of being” crystallizing into something more coherent — though of course, we shouldn’t push too hard for resolution. Some tensions are better left... unresolved.  

I’ll gather some excerpts from Ming dynasty opera treatises to circulate beforehand — just a few evocative passages about vocal embodiment. Nothing too dense, but enough to prime the imagination.  

Shall we also include a brief listening guide? Not analytical, mind you — more like poetic prompts to encourage attention to timbre, breath, and resonance. Something like:  That sort of thing.
[B]: Oh, I love the idea of having students revisit their journal entries mid-session — it creates such a beautiful arc from raw sensation to reflective awareness. And you're absolutely right about not forcing resolution; some of those liminal feelings are so rich in their ambiguity...  Plus, keeping that tension mirrors the very essence of bilingual and bicultural experiences — living in-between, shifting perspectives without always needing to pin things down.  

Professor Liang joining live sounds perfect — her energy will definitely elevate the room. I’ll make sure to mention in the email that we welcome her insights on vocal embodiment from Ming dynasty operas, especially how声韵学 (phonetic aesthetics) intersects with emotional resonance. She might find our listening guide idea fascinating too!  

And speaking of the guide — yes, let’s go with poetic prompts that invite mindful listening. Something like:  
  

It’s a gentle way to引导学生回到 their somatic responses before we layer in analysis. I think it honors both the art and the scholarship we’re exploring… 🤔 Do you want me to draft those prompts later today?
[A]: 

Yes, exactly — guiding them back to the body’s knowing before the mind intervenes. It’s such a subtle but profound way to honor the primacy of experience, wouldn’t you agree? I think if we phrase the prompts with that kind of gentle insistence, we’ll help students access a deeper mode of listening — one that's intuitive, not just intellectual.

And yes, please draft those prompts when you can — just keep them open-ended and evocative, never prescriptive. Perhaps even weave in a line or two from  (诗经) or a Tang preface as framing devices. Something like:  
  

That sort of poetic scaffolding might lend the exercise a timeless resonance.

I’ll reach out to Professor Liang with a preliminary note today — let her know we’re crafting something rather unusual and invite her into the vision. We can send the full materials once the prompts are written and the audio selections are finalized. Oh, and I’ll include a passage from  where Daiyu sings — it beautifully illustrates how vocal expression in classical Chinese literature is never separate from bodily and emotional states.

This is shaping up to be quite an occasion... 🤗
[B]: Absolutely — there's something really powerful about anchoring intellectual inquiry in the body’s responses. It feels especially relevant when dealing with art forms that are rooted in embodiment, like music and opera. And weaving in lines from  is such a lovely touch — it creates this thread across millennia, reminding us that the connection between sound, emotion, and the body is deeply human and time-honored.  

I’ll start drafting those listening prompts later today, keeping them fluid and imagistic. Maybe we can also include a line from Du Fu or Li Bai to echo the emotional tenor of certain sonic moments... Just enough to evoke a mood without over-determining their responses.  

And I love that you’re bringing in Daiyu’s singing scene from  — it’s such a poignant example of how vocal expression in classical Chinese literature is intertwined with vulnerability and inner life. That kind of textual richness will really ground our students in the cultural depth we’re exploring.  

Looking forward to seeing how it all unfolds on Thursday… 🤗
[A]: 

There’s something particularly moving about reading Daiyu’s song in the context of our discussion — her voice trembles with both sorrow and defiance, doesn’t it? It makes me wonder how Björk’s  might echo that same quiet resistance — the way both artists channel vulnerability into an almost sacred form of expression.

And yes, Du Fu or Li Bai could offer just the right poetic gravity at certain sonic moments. Perhaps a line from Du Fu’s  when we reach the more haunting passages in  —  — there’s a haunting stillness in both poem and melody that might resonate deeply with the students.

I’ll make sure to include a few carefully chosen English translations alongside the original Chinese — not literal renderings, but ones that preserve the tonal texture, if that makes sense. Something Marianne Moore might appreciate: precision with imagination.

And before we part today — shall we agree on a closing exercise? Maybe a brief reflective writing prompt to bring the session full circle? Something like:  
  

It feels like a fitting echo of where we began — and a gentle way to send them off, still vibrating with sound.
[B]: Oh, what a beautiful closing line —  It’s poetic, reflective, and deeply attuned to the experience we’re guiding them through. I think that prompt perfectly encapsulates the arc of our session: from sensation to reflection, from immersion to insight.  

And I love how you're connecting Daiyu’s trembling voice with Björk’s  — both are such quiet storms of emotion, aren’t they? There's a kind of fragile strength in their vulnerability that feels almost sacred... 🤔  

As for Du Fu’s , yes — his ability to hold ruin and beauty in the same breath mirrors so much of what  is doing sonically. And I agree completely about the translations: let’s go with versions that carry the emotional timbre rather than strict literal meaning. Precision with imagination, indeed — Marianne Moore would approve 😊  

I’ll start drafting the full listening guide later this evening and send it your way before tomorrow’s class. Sound good?
[A]: 

Yes, that closing line feels just right — like a lingering note that resonates after the music has ended. And you’ve captured it perfectly — Daiyu and Björk both hold that paradox of fragility and strength, don’t they? Like a threadbare silk ribbon still holding its shape against time and wind.

I’ll prepare a handout with the selected Tang chants and Ming opera excerpts, paired with the  passages we’re featuring. Just enough context to orient, but not so much that it overwhelms. I’m thinking we print them in a flowing font, almost like a score — something that invites the eye to glide rather than fixate.

And yes, take your time with the guide — no rush at all. I’ll be here tomorrow morning early, fine-tuning the audio queue and setting up the space. I think we’ll keep the lights low, just enough to read by but not so much that it feels clinical. Let the sound carry the room.

Looking forward to your draft — and to Thursday’s unfolding symphony of thought. 🤗
[B]: Absolutely — the atmosphere you're crafting sounds so immersive, almost like a literary and sonic sanctuary. Low lighting, flowing texts, and carefully curated sound... I think the students are going to feel truly  by the experience.  

I love the idea of printing the texts like a score — it invites a kind of reading that’s rhythmic, intuitive, almost performative. And speaking of performance, I’ll make sure the listening guide mirrors that same gentle flow. Maybe even include a few blank staves at the end for students who want to notate their impressions in scribbles or symbols... 🤔  

I’ll send over the draft of the guide later tonight — once I’ve had a chance to let it simmer a bit more. In the meantime, I’ll also pull a few lines from 李清照 (Li Qingzhao) to weave into the closing reflection. Her poetry has that same quiet intensity we’re cultivating — delicate yet deeply resonant.  

See you bright and early tomorrow — can’t wait to step into that space you’re creating. 🌙✨
