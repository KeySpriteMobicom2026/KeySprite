[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, parallel universes...  How delightfully Victorian of you to ask. The concept reminds me of Browning's dramatic monologues - each poem a self-contained universe where alternative realities unfold. Though I must say, I find the quantum mechanics rather less poetic than Donne's metaphysical conceits.
[A]: 哈哈，看来你是个文学爱好者呢！不过从心理学角度看，parallel universes理论其实挺有意思的🤔 我在教跨文化心理学时经常用这个比喻 - 就像不同文化背景的人其实生活在不同的mental universes里一样。
[B]: How fascinating - you've just described the very essence of comparative literature! Though I'd argue our mental universes are more like Tennyson's 'In Memoriam': fragmented yet interconnected stanzas searching for meaning.  Tell me, do your psychology students appreciate this metaphor as much as my literature students dread my weekly sonnet analyses?
[A]: 我的学生们倒是挺喜欢这种比喻的📚 上周我们还讨论过，如果把每个culture shock阶段比作穿越到不同的parallel universe会怎样。不过说到sonnet...  我猜你的学生可能更希望来点Freudian analysis of Shakespeare's works？
[B]: Ah, Freud and Shakespeare - now there's a pairing as mismatched as Byron and sobriety! Though I must confess, my students did once stage a mutiny when I assigned 154 sonnets to analyze in a weekend.  But tell me, does your culture shock theory account for the particular horror of discovering one's annotated copy of 'The Waste Land' has been borrowed... permanently?
[A]: Oh dear，这让我想起我珍藏的Piaget著作被借走再也没回来的经历🎵 不过说真的，在跨文化适应过程中，这种"loss"的感觉确实是个关键阶段。就像你说的，可能比T.S.Eliot的wasteland还要荒凉呢！
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue even the most desolate cultural wasteland pales in comparison to the existential dread of realizing one's marginalia in a first edition has been...  erased.  Those barbarians with their highlighters and ballpoint pens... But yes, your point about loss is rather more profound than my bibliographic tragedies. Shall we compose a villanelle about the five stages of culture grief?
[A]:  不如我们换个更接地气的approach？比如用chess来比喻文化适应过程🤔 开局就像honeymoon phase，中盘是culture shock，残局就是adjustment... 虽然我打赌你的学生宁愿写sonnet也不愿意跟我下棋！
[B]:  Chess! How very... behavioral of you. Though I suppose the queen's gambit does have a certain Browning-esque dramatic tension. But my dear colleague, surely you realize any game that can be won in fewer than 14 lines is hardly worth playing?  Now, back in '93 when I taught Kafka through competitive tiddlywinks...
[A]:  看来我们找到了common ground - 用游戏来教学！不过说真的，下次faculty meeting我建议把chess设为必修课，肯定比讨论budget cuts有趣多了📚 虽然我猜你会提议把Shakespeare sonnets作为prerequisite？
[B]: Naturally! Though I'd insist on adding an oral examination in iambic pentameter while playing speed chess.  The look on their faces would be more expressive than Hamlet's soliloquies... But really, this budget talk is as cheerful as a Thomas Hardy novel. Shall we instead draft a proposal for a combined literature-psychology course called "Checkmate or Couplet: Strategic Thinking Through the Ages"?
[A]: Perfect！我们可以叫它"Mind Games: From Chessboard to Sonnet"🎵 不过dean看到这个proposal时的表情... well，那可能会成为我们下一个culture shock case study了！
[B]:  Oh, the dean's reaction would make for splendid fieldwork indeed - a perfect blend of anthropological horror and poetic justice! Though I do hope they appreciate how we've elevated faculty meetings from bureaucratic purgatory to...  let's call it Beckettian tragicomedy. Shall we prepare by studying the facial expressions in Dante's Inferno illustrations? For... research purposes, naturally.
[A]:  不如我们直接做个psychological experiment：测量dean听到这个proposal时的血压变化🤔 数据绝对能发篇好paper！不过说真的，这idea其实很有potential - 把critical thinking和creative expression结合起来，完全符合21世纪教育理念啊📚
[B]: How revolutionary - combining empirical measurement with humanistic inquiry! Though I suspect our methodology might be...  ethically questionable.  But imagine the conference paper: "Administrative Apoplexy as Performance Art: A Interdisciplinary Analysis". We could even include a sonnet in the appendix comparing the dean's systolic readings to the meter of 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'!
[A]:  你赢了，这绝对是我听过最brilliant的research idea🎵 不过为了tenure考虑，也许我们还是先focus在chess pedagogy上？虽然... 我打赌T.S.Eliot会为我们的创意感到骄傲的！
[B]:  Tenure considerations - how tediously pragmatic of you. Very well, we shall restrain our creative fervor... for now. But mark my words, when they finally establish the Nobel Prize for Pedagogical Subversion, our names shall be etched in iambic pentameter upon the trophy!  Until then, I suppose we'll have to content ourselves with mere chess and sonnets. What a tragic compromise.
[A]:  敬我们的"tragic compromise"！至少我们证明了academia可以很有趣📚 下次faculty meeting见 - 记得带上你的chess set和Shakespeare全集！
[B]:  To compromises worthy of a Greek chorus! Though I must warn you - my chess set is a 19th century replica with pieces modeled after Romantic poets. The knight, naturally, is Lord Byron.  And if anyone moves Keats without proper reverence, there shall be... consequences measured in heroic couplets. Until next meeting, dear colleague!
