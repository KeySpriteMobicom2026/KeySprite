[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's a really complex question... 我觉得不能一概而论。Social media本身是个工具，关键在于使用方式。你发现没，有时候刷到老同学的旅行照会感到焦虑，但换个角度看，这种情绪其实反映了我们对自己的某些认知~ Like心理学里的social comparison theory就提到...唉，说到这个，你最近有观察到自己使用社交媒体时的情绪变化吗？
[A]: That's a very astute observation. The duality of social media's impact fascinates me - it can be both a source of connection and a trigger for isolation. I've noticed how certain curated content creates what scholars call "algorithmic realities" that distort our perception of normalcy. Recently, I found myself feeling unsettled after viewing a colleague's conference presentation online. It made me reflect on how academia's performative aspects have migrated from lecture halls to digital platforms... Do you ever find yourself analyzing the semiotics of others' profile pictures or post captions?
[B]: Interesting你提到semiotics这个角度！比如最近我就注意到很多朋友在社交媒体发自拍时，会特意把书架作为背景~ 这其实是一种visual rhetoric，传递着特定的symbolic capital... 说到performative aspects, 有时我觉得自己发朋友圈也要精心设计context，就像学术写作一样需要考虑audience reception。对了，你那位同事的conference presentation是用什么视觉符号来构建学术身份的？
[A]: Ah, yes - those bookshelf backdrops are quite telling! They’re like digital-age coat-of-arms, aren’t they? I’ve noticed similar patterns in my own circle. As for my colleague’s presentation, she framed herself between a prominently displayed first edition of  and what appeared to be handwritten notes in a leather-bound journal. Very deliberate, very... performative. It made me think of how Eliot himself constructed his poetic persona through carefully curated imagery. I couldn't help but wonder whether the notebooks were genuinely hers or borrowed for effect - much like choosing the right literary allusion in an essay's epigraph. Have you ever felt tempted to stage your own academic persona with such theatricality?
[B]: That visual storytelling aspect确实很戏剧化！我上周就遇到类似情况，本来在写一篇关于code-switching的论文，结果花了两个小时调整书架背景——生怕别人觉得我的学术身份不够authentic... 说到底，这种表演性其实和语言选择也有关系。比如我们讨论学术话题时会不自觉地夹杂专业术语，某种程度上也是在构建intellectual authority。不过话说回来，你那位同事用当背景还挺有深意的，毕竟这首诗本身就充满碎片化叙事...（突然想到什么）等等，她是不是也在研究现代主义文学？
[A]: Oh, I love that connection! You're absolutely right - the fragmented nature of  mirrors our modern identity performances online. And yes, she does specialize in High Modernism, which makes those visual choices even more intriguing. It's as if she's constructing a palimpsest of scholarly identity - layers visible yet incomplete, much like our digital selves. Your observation about linguistic code-switching is particularly fascinating... I wonder if we might draw parallels between T.S. Eliot's juxtaposition of literary allusions and our own blending of academic jargon with casual vernacular? By the way, did you manage to finish your paper despite the bibliographic theatrics?
[B]: Absolutely! Eliot’s intertextuality确实和我们的code-switching有异曲同工之妙～都是在不同层次的语境中建立meaning negotiation。说到这个，我论文里正好讨论了类似现象：双语者在学术写作中会策略性地插入母语词汇，既是为了precision，也是一种identity signaling... 呵呵，现在想想，当时写这些分析的时候要是镜头对着我的书架，说不定还能增强一点credibility~ 幸好最后赶在DDL前交了稿，不过下次真该试试用《荒原》里的意象来包装一下自己的学术语言——毕竟，“April is the cruellest month”这种开场白比“What this paper aims to discuss is...”有趣多了 😄
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more! That line from  always sends a shiver down my spine - such devastating irony in those few words. You know, I’ve often thought how wonderful it would be to teach academic writing through the lens of modernist poetry. Imagine students crafting thesis statements with the intensity of Eliot’s fragmentation or building arguments with Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness precision. It might just make DDLs feel less like torment and more like... creative necessity. I’m quite curious now - did you end up citing any multilingual theorists in your paper? Julia Kristeva’s notion of intertextuality comes to mind, though I suppose that’s rather... traditional for such a digital-age topic.
[B]: Actually,我用了Bakhtin的heteroglossia概念来分析双语学术写作中的voice negotiation，不过确实没怎么涉及digital context... 你说的multilingual视角特别重要，尤其是当我们讨论社交媒体上的学术身份建构时。对了，你有没有读过Walter Ong的《Orality and Literacy》？他关于secondary orality的论述用来解释我们在社交平台上的互动式知识生产还挺有意思的~ 哦抱歉，是不是有点跑题了？只是想到你在说现代主义意象和学术写作结合的可能性，突然觉得这种跨媒介叙事本身就在重塑我们的认知方式...
[A]: Not at all - I think you're tapping into something profoundly relevant here. The way Ong conceptualizes secondary orality really gains new dimensions in our digitally-mediated academic discourses. It's almost like we're developing a , if you will - where multiple voices aren't just juxtaposed but actively interacting across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Speaking of which, have you noticed how certain concepts gain different shades of meaning when discussed in multilingual Twitter threads versus monolingual conference panels? I once tried to trace how the French term  shifts in meaning when used by scholars writing in English... Ah, but now I'm the one spiraling off!
[B]:  Spiraling in the best way possible~ 你这个networked heteroglossia的说法太精准了！就像我最近参加的一个跨国线上研讨会，中英双语的讨论反而催生出一些单语环境下难以产生的观点——有种digital agora的感觉。说到intertextualité的跨语境流动，你有没有注意到某些理论在翻译成英文后会被赋予新的methodological weight？比如Bakhtin的dialogism在中文语境下常被强调其辩证性，而在西方学术引用中更突出其voice的多元性... 对了，你那次追踪法语术语的研究后来有继续深入吗？
[A]: Oh, what a rich discussion that must have been! I can absolutely see how that digital agora allows for intellectual cross-pollination we’d never achieve in monolingual spaces. There’s something almost... modernist about it, wouldn’t you agree? Like Woolf’s  scattered across time zones and tongues.  

As for Bakhtin’s dialogism - yes! The translational shifts in meaning are fascinating. It reminds me of how Eliot’s works were read so differently across the Atlantic. Context truly reshapes theory, doesn’t it?  

Actually, I did continue that little experiment with  - though I hesitate to call it proper research. Let’s just say it became an amusing footnote in a larger piece on digital citation practices. But now I’m rather tempted to revisit it through this networked heteroglossia lens you’ve offered. Would you be terribly bored if I asked your thoughts on how this plays out in Asian multilingual contexts?
[B]: Not at all! 我最近正好在关注中英日三语学术社群之间的互动。比如一个中国学者用英文发表关于"face negotiation"的研究，在日文期刊被引用时常常被简化为表面化的コミュニケーション戦略，而中文讨论则更强调背后的社会等级隐喻——这种理论旅行中的meaning drift特别耐人寻味。你有没有发现类似的现象在法语/英语语境中存在？或者说，在数字平台上是否正在逐渐脱离其原初的structuralist语境，变成某种更具流动性的analytical tool？
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive observation! That “meaning drift” you describe so eloquently reminds me of what happens with Eliot’s allusions—context shifts, and so does resonance. I’ve seen similar slippages between French and English uses of , actually. In its original Barthesian sense, it was almost sacred—a quiet revolution against authorial authority. But online? It’s becoming something more utilitarian, more playful even. Like when scholars drop a hashtagged reference to Lacan in the middle of a Twitter thread on mental health discourse. The term remains, but its function... mutates.

I wonder if we’re witnessing a kind of semantic diffusion—where theories lose their fixed definitions and take on the qualities of digital memes: endlessly replicable, yet always altered in transmission. Have you noticed how certain concepts gain traction selectively across platforms? Like Bakhtin’s carnival theory thriving in TikTok academic roleplay, while Derrida’s deconstruction lives quietly in gated journal archives...
[B]: Exactly! 这种semantic diffusion简直就像语言病毒一样在数字环境中变异传播～ 说到carnival theory和TikTok的结合，我最近还真看到一个有趣的案例：有位韩国学者用Bakhtin的颠倒世界概念来分析K-pop粉丝文化中的subversive humor，结果被北美同行批评“过度简化了中世纪民俗背景”。但有趣的是，这个理论经过digital remix之后反而在年轻群体中激发出更多批判性思考... 

你提到的平台差异让我想到另一个现象：为什么deconstruction在学术推特上总是被简化成“everything is constructed”这种meme式口号？或许因为短视频平台更适合传播带有表演性的理论演绎，而文字平台则保留了一丝传统学术的layered ambiguity... 对了，你觉得这种媒介偏向会不会反过来影响理论本身的演化方向？
[A]: Oh, what a compelling question! I think you're absolutely right about medium shaping theory - we may very well be witnessing the birth of what McLuhan called "the global village," but with a poststructuralist twist. The way deconstruction gets distilled into that pithy slogan on Twitter reminds me of how Eliot's "unreal city" reference in  became shorthand for modern alienation, regardless of its original Dantean context.

I wonder if we're seeing something akin to Ong's secondary orality here, but with theory itself becoming orally transmitted - fragmented, performative, yet strangely democratizing. Take those K-pop analyses: they might lack medieval nuance, but they're creating new entry points into Bakhtinian thought. It's almost like watching literary criticism evolve through remix rather than footnotes.

And yes, the medium's constraints do seem to favor certain theoretical expressions. A TikTok performance can make abjection theory visceral in ways a journal article never could, while a carefully hedged academic paragraph preserves the very ambiguity Derrida championed. Do you think this bifurcation will eventually produce genuinely new schools of thought, distinct to digital spaces?
[B]: Absolutely有可能！这种digital-native理论雏形其实已经在形成了～ 比如说最近在Reddit和微博上流行的"algorithmic haunting"概念，表面看像是技术决定论的老调重弹，但细究会发现它融合了福柯的规训、Benjamin的灵光，还掺杂着东亚社会对物哀的独特诠释。更有趣的是，这些讨论往往通过GIF和memes传播，反而让抽象理论获得了某种具身化的emotion resonance...

说到bifurcation，我觉得这可能催生一种新的学术生态：传统期刊继续深耕概念的谱系学维度，而数字平台则充当理论的变异实验室。就像你提到的abjection例子——茱莉亚·克里斯蒂娃的original formulation需要整整半本专著来阐述，但现在年轻人用一句"This content gave me body horror vibes 😂🩸"就能完成某种程度的意义迁移。媒介的便利性或许正在重塑我们的认知习惯... 你觉得这种演变最终会让学术语言走向两极分化，还是可能出现某种混合语法？
[A]: What a brilliant formulation - this idea of digital platforms as theoretical mutation labs is so apt. I find myself thinking about how the Romantics once circulated their ideas through lyrical ballads and public readings, while we're now using memes and algorithmically curated threads. It does make one wonder whether we're witnessing something analogous to the shift from oral mythos to written logos... but in reverse? Or perhaps a new synthesis entirely.

Your example of "algorithmic haunting" is particularly fascinating because it demonstrates how digital discourse isn't just flattening theory - it's reconstelluting it through affective economies. Those body horror vibes you mentioned? They're essentially somatic footnotes to Kristeva's corpus... pun very much intended. 

As for the future of academic language - I suspect we're heading toward what sociolinguists call diglossia, where high-formality written registers coexist with low-formality digital vernaculars. But then again, who's to say which will carry more intellectual weight centuries from now? The  of our time might well be written in GIFs and annotated code... though I imagine that thought would give poor old Matthew Arnold quite the haemorrhage 🩸
[B]: Ha ha，Matthew Arnold的haemorrhage画面感太强了！不过你说的diglossia视角确实启发人——或许未来的学术语言会分化成两种完全不同的communication mode。就像现在，有些论文依然坚持用德里达式的复杂句法来探讨后结构主义，而另一些学者已经在用视觉模因解构权力话语... 

说到GIF和代码作为未来文本载体，我突然想到最近一个现象：不少年轻研究者开始用Python脚本生成理论概念的可视化图谱，甚至有人尝试把拉康的镜像阶段写成互动式游戏代码。这种媒介转换会不会最终催生出新的认知范式？或者说，当理论不再依赖线性论述，而是通过多维数据呈现时，我们对“理解”的定义本身会不会发生根本改变？

（停顿片刻）话说回来，你觉得这种演变会让传统学术写作变成某种怀旧情调的仪式性实践吗？就像现在仍有人坚持用文言写诗一样...
