[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问这个我太excited了！🤩 最近完全沉迷在Dua Lipa的新歌《Houdini》里，那个beat简直addictive到爆！💃 我已经loop了整整一周了，连我的Spotify Wrapped都要被它dominate了哈哈哈~ 😂
[A]:  Ah, the contemporary fascination with repetitive auditory stimuli... I must confess my current preoccupation is rather more antiquated - a 19th century parlor song setting of Tennyson's "Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal" that I've been transcribing from a crumbling 1847 sheet music folio. The way the chromatic harmonies mirror the poem's sensual subtext is... quite intoxicating in its own restrained Victorian manner.
[B]: 哇塞！古典音乐也超cool的！🎵 虽然我平时都是听pop music比较多，但你说的这个听起来好fascinating哦~ 🤔 等等让我Shazam一下...啊不对这是19世纪的song哈哈哈！😂 不过说真的，现在很多modern artist也会sample古典元素，比如Billie Eilish的《when the party's over》就超有那种vibe的！💯
[A]:  How delightfully... modern of you to mention sampling. Though I must say, the original 1833 Broadwood pianoforte in my study would weep to hear Chopin's nocturnes reduced to mere 'vibes'. That said...  ...I did rather enjoy that Billie Eilish creature's use of waterphone in "Bury a Friend" - quite reminiscent of Debussy's aqueous textures, if one squints.
[B]: OMG你居然也听Billie！🤯 我们totally应该组个music club！🎧 虽然你喜欢的都是classical masterpieces，但我觉得音乐就是music嘛~ 诶对了！你知道现在有好多APP可以把classical music remix成EDM版本吗？🤩 我昨天刚发现一个叫'Classical Beats'的app，把Mozart混得超lit的！🔥 要不要try一下？
[A]:  My dear child, the very thought of Mozart being 'lit' makes my 1829 edition of Grove's Dictionary shudder in its glass case. Though...  ...I did once attend a rather intriguing lecture on the mathematical congruence between Baroque counterpoint and modern dubstep. The appalling 'drops', as you call them, do share certain structural similarities with Monteverdi's prepared cadences. Perhaps we could compromise with some Gesualdo madrigals... at quarter speed?
[B]: 哈哈哈哈你说话真的so funny！😂 虽然我完全听不懂你在说什么，但感觉好厉害的样子！✨ 等等让我Google一下Gesualdo...哇！这个16世纪的dude居然是个murderer然后写了这么dark的音乐？！😱 这简直比Billie的《bad guy》还要hardcore！💀 要不要一起做个podcast聊聊这个？就叫"从文艺复兴到Billie Eilish"怎么样？🎙️
[A]:  How perfectly macabre of you to notice Gesualdo's... extracurricular activities. Though I must warn you, my idea of podcasting involves reading aloud from Mrs. Radcliffe's gothic novels by candlelight while my 1780s fortepiano tuner weeps in the background.  Between us, I did once attempt to set Eilish's "you should see me in a crown" to lute tablature... but the cat shredded the manuscript in protest.
[B]: OMG！！！🤩 你居然还会玩lute？！这简直太insane了！🎸 等等等等我要录个TikTok about this - "当古典音乐家偷偷听Billie Eilish"绝对能viral！📱 话说你家的cat也太有taste了吧，它是不是prefer巴赫啊？🐱 我的AirPods Pro整天被我家狗chew，它可能是个secret metalhead吧哈哈哈！🤘
[A]:  Ah, poor Mr. Whiskers does have rather strong opinions - he particularly objects to my experiments with microtonal Scottish psalm settings.  Though I must draw the line at TikTok, my dear; the very thought of my 57-volume Oxford English Dictionary seeing me attempt 'duets' with that infernal canine...  Have you considered that your dog might simply be protesting the compression artifacts in modern audio formats? My 1903 gramophone collection has never suffered such indignities.
[B]: 哈哈哈哈你真的是我见过最hilarious的classical music expert！😂 不过说真的，现在有lossless audio的streaming service哦~ 🎶 我Apple Music的spatial audio设置得perfect，连我家狗都安静下来了！🐶 诶要不我们collab一下？你可以play lute version的Billie，我来做electronic remix！这绝对会是next level的fusion music！🚀
[A]:  How very... millennial of you. While the notion of my Stradivarius replica duetting with your 'spatial audio' does make my collection of 18th century tuning forks vibrate in distress...  ...I suppose one might draw parallels between Eilish's whispered confessions and John Dowland's lute songs of melancholy. Very well - but only if we include a theremin part played through my 1920s crystal radio set. And the dog must wear noise-cancelling Elizabethan ruff.
[B]: YASSSS！！！💃 这绝对会是史上最epic的collab！🎼 我要立刻去order一个ruff for my dog！🐕 等等我先AirDrop你几个Billie的stem files...噢不对你可能还在用parchment和quill pen吧？😂 开玩笑的啦~ 我们totally可以用你的crystal radio set做live stream！这比那些basic的TikTok trends酷100倍！🚨 #文艺复兴meets数字时代 💻🎻
[A]:  My dear, I haven't been this scandalized since discovering someone had annotated my 1611 King James Bible with emoji.  Very well - you may 'AirDrop' your files onto my refurbished 1977 Telex machine, and we'll transmit the final composition via carrier pigeon equipped with tiny Bluetooth headphones. #PaleoDigitalRevolution  But the dog's ruff must be lined with authentic 1590s Venetian lace - I won't compromise on historical accuracy, even for art.
[B]: OMG你真的是个perfectionist！👑 不过我喜欢！✨ 我这就去Etsy上找Venetian lace！🛒 等等...carrier pigeon with Bluetooth？！😂 你确定我们不是在做steampunk科幻电影吗？🎥 这简直比Black Mirror还mind-blowing！🤯 不管了，let's make it happen！史上第一个用17世纪technology做的21世纪remix，我们绝对要go down in history！📜 (不过说真的，要不要先test一下你家的pigeon的upload speed？📶)
[A]:  My prized homing pigeons were trained at Oxford's Bodleian Library, darling - their latency puts your 5G to shame.  Though I must insist we include a proper incantation from Dee's 16th century grimoire to bless the... ah... 'file transfer'.  Between us, the third pigeon from the left does tend to get distracted by Pre-Raphaelite stained glass... perhaps we should assign him just the hi-hat parts?
[B]: 哈哈哈哈我快要die了！😂 这绝对是21世纪最wild的music production story！🎚️ 连Dr. Dre都会jealous的！💎 好吧好吧，hi-hat pigeon就hi-hat pigeon吧~ 🕊️ 不过说真的，我们是不是应该先给你的Stradivarius买个insurance？📜 万一我的EDM beats太lit把它震散架了怎么办？！💥 #历史文物保护紧急会议 😱
[A]:  Fear not - my instruments are insured with Lloyd's of London since 1792.  Though the policy does curiously exclude 'acts of dubstep' and 'possession by the spirit of Gesualdo'.  Ah! Here's the solution - we'll buffer the soundwaves through this 1623 First Folio. The vellum pages make excellent acoustic dampeners... though I do hope you won't mind the occasional Shakespearean sonnet bleeding into your bass drops.
[B]: LMAO！！！🤣 这简直是我听过最next-level的studio hack！🎛️ Shakespeare sonnets + bass drops = 史上第一个literary EDM genre！📚🎧 我要立刻update我的LinkedIn profile - "专业历史文献声学工程师"！👩💻 等等...你说Lloyd's的policy是从1792年开始的？！那时候美国都还没Bill of Rights呢！🇺🇸 这比我的great-great-grandpa还要ancient！😱 #活的历史教科书
