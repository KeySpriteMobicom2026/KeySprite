[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There’s something undeniably intimate about a handwritten letter—the weight of the paper, the slant of the handwriting, even the faint smudge of ink. It carries a presence, a trace of the writer's hand. Of course, digital notes offer convenience, though they often lack that quiet humanity. I still keep a drawer full of letters from my mentor—yellowed pages filled with fountain pen musings on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Do you write letters by hand?
[A]: 我倒是深有同感。每当我执笔于信笺之上，总觉得字里行间流露的不只是言语，更是执笔时的心绪与情怀。砚台研墨的沉静、笔锋触纸的沙响、乃至落款时的那一方小印，皆是写信人与收信人之间独有的默契。我书房中亦藏有一叠旧信，每每翻阅，仿佛又见故人身影，听其娓娓道来当年讲学于岳麓书院的情景。你那位导师想必是一位极富人文气质的长者吧？信中谈及托尔斯泰与陀思妥耶夫斯基，令我不禁想起曾译读《战争与和平》片段时的心潮起伏。
[B]: Ah, your description is positively poetic—, the weight of ink carrying memory... I can picture it vividly. Yes, my mentor was very much a man of letters, in both senses of the word. He once wrote to me:  And you—you've translated from ? That must have been quite an experience, capturing that vastness in another tongue. Do you recall a particular passage that stayed with you?
[A]: “人在托翁的宏阔史笔与陀氏的炽烈剖白间，方得窥见俄罗斯文学的魂魄。”你导师此语极是。每每读到这等句子，便觉翻译之责，非但求字面之工，更须传其神髓。说起译《战争与和平》，确是一番浩繁而深沉的功夫。尤记娜塔莎初次舞会那一段，少年心事、华灯初上、衣香鬓影，皆在纸间流转。我曾反复推敲“она влюбилась в жизнь”这一句，最终落笔为“她爱上了生命本身”，欲其既存少女情思，又涵人生初悟。你平日治学，亦常涉此类语言之微妙处吧？
[B]: —what a delicate choice of phrasing. You’ve captured both the naiveté and the awakening in that fleeting moment. It reminds me of a passage I often teach from , where Levin, gazing at the sky, feels momentarily unburdened by existential dread. The Russian word —often translated as "rapture" or "ecstasy"—never quite settles in English, does it? One must choose carefully: should it shimmer with religious awe, or tremble with personal revelation?  

I find these subtleties are what make comparative literature so endlessly fascinating. Tell me, in your translation journey, have you ever encountered a phrase that resisted translation so fiercely it almost seemed to vanish in the process?
[A]: “восторг”一词，确乎难以尽意。译者常处两难之间：若取“欣喜若狂”，则失其深沉；若用“敬畏之喜”，又恐矫饰。我曾于译《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》时遇有一句：“душа его пела восторженным гимном”，原拟作“他的灵魂唱起赞歌般的颂曲”，后觉“颂曲”过于宗教化，遂改为“他的心灵在高唱赞美的歌”，然仍觉略失俄文原句那股由衷而发的激荡之情。

至于你所言“翻译如追魂”，我亦深有体会。最难忘一次，是在译陶渊明《饮酒》其五时，那句“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”。英人多译为“When I pick chrysanthemums beneath the eastern hedge, I gaze idly at the southern hills”，却总觉少了“悠然”二字背后那种不期而遇、物我两忘的意境。我曾反复思忖，是否该以“in quiet ease I lift my eyes to Southern Mountain”来传达那份不经意中的会心？可终究还是不敢妄自改动古人之意。你治学西洋文学，想必也常与这类“语言之隙”周旋吧？
[B]: Ah, yes—the elusive  (悠然). It is a perfect example of what we in comparative literature call —those words that shimmer with cultural and philosophical weight. The English “quiet ease” captures something, certainly, but loses the subtle Daoist undertone of effortless grace, of being at one with the moment without trying. One might even say it’s akin to  (无为)—though I hesitate to insert a Chinese concept into a discussion of classical Chinese poetry translated into English!  

And your struggle with Dostoevsky’s —oh, I know it well. There are phrases that seem to resist every hand that touches them, as though they wish to remain forever bound to their native tongue. I once wrestled for days with a single line from Flaubert:  Should it be "She was there, all presence and yet entirely absent"? Or "She was present, and not present at all"? In the end, I chose a version that leaned into paradox—but sacrificed lyricism. A necessary loss, perhaps.

Do you think, given enough time and revision, a translation can ever fully sing in its new language? Or must it always carry the ghost of its original cadence?
[A]: 你提到“悠然”与“восторженным гимном”这类词语，实为译事中最耐人寻味之处。正如古人所云：“意翻空而易奇，文征实而难巧。”语言之间若有鸿沟，则文化、意念、情感皆难以全然渡越。翻译之道，常似摹画月影，虽可近其形，终难尽其光华。

我以为，真正出色的译作，并非要让原作在新语中“全然重生”，而是使其在异土中生根发芽，开出相似却非一模一样的花。如钱钟书先生所言：“译事三难：信、达、雅。”信者，不背原文；达者，通顺自然；雅者，有文采风骨。三者并举，谈何容易！

至于你问——译作能否在新的语言中完全唱出原声？我想起朱光潜先生曾说：“诗不可译，而犹不得不译。”也许我们所求的，并非“全然歌唱”，而是一种回响。像古琴之音，余韵绵长，虽非高亢激昂，却能在人心深处荡起涟漪。那原作的节奏、语气乃至呼吸，或隐或现地存于字里行间，成为一种幽微的背景音，引导着读者去聆听另一种语言中的诗意。

若以你的 Flaubert 为例，“Elle était là, toute présence et absence à la fois.” 我读英译时，虽未见法文原句之姿，却仍能感受到那份矛盾的张力。或许这正是好译本的力量：它不是复制，而是唤起。正如观画者不见真山，却因画中山水而心有所动。

你我皆知，翻译之路无尽头，修订千遍亦未必尽善尽美。但正是这种“永远在路上”的状态，使文学得以跨越语言，延续生命。你说是也不是？
[B]: Precisely—translation is not a destination but a continuous movement, a kind of eternal becoming. The idea that a translated work might take root in new soil and bloom differently—yet still recognizably—strikes me as both humble and deeply poetic. It avoids the hubris of perfect fidelity while still honoring the spirit of the original.

I find myself thinking of Vladimir Nabokov, who famously insisted on literalism, even at the cost of elegance, believing that the translator’s duty was more archaeological than artistic. And yet, as you so beautifully put it, what we seek is not replication but resonance—an echo that lingers, even if altered by distance.

Your image of the  of the original voice—its rhythm, its breath—haunting the translation like the faintest trace of incense in an empty room... I shall carry that with me into my next seminar on Baudelaire and his English interpreters. Perhaps that is the highest aim: to let the ghost speak clearly enough, without pretending it has left its grave behind.

Yes, you are quite right. We remain forever on the road—and perhaps literature, like life, is meant to be walked, not arrived.
[A]: 翻译如行路，确无终点，亦如古人云：“译者，逆也；言之成理为难。”此“逆”非逆于原意，而是逆流而上，追寻语言之源，又顺流而下，融入异语之境。其间起伏曲折，正如你所言，是一场永恒的流转。

纳博科夫之直译观，虽重考据，却亦有其深意。然文学毕竟不独属字义，更关乎情韵、气息与风骨。若只求词义准确，犹如临碑而不辨笔势，只见形貌而忘神采。译文当如古画之摹本，须见前人之意，亦有己心之发。

你将原作之音喻为“空室余香”，那淡淡痕迹，恰似翻译之魂——既不可全然散去，亦不能喧宾夺主。我想起钱钟书论翻译时曾比之为“寄宿”，译文是旅舍，原作是行客，虽歇脚于此，终非久居之地。然若旅舍布置得宜，使行客稍舒筋骨，且能遥望故乡山水，则亦可谓尽其所托。

至于巴尔蒂斯与英译者之间，那一缕“鬼声”尤须细听。英译若失其调，则如琴走音，虽曲未变，而意已远。然若过于拘泥，则反失其声气之自然。或可取中道而行，如古人所谓“得意忘言”，先得其意，而后斟酌其辞。

你说得极是，我们始终在路上。或许正因未至彼岸，方能不断前行；正因未能尽言，方能继续书写。这既是文学之道，也是人生之理。
[B]: Ah, —what a perfect phrase to carry into the translator’s dilemma. It suggests that before one can even begin to shape meaning in another tongue, one must first  in the original long enough to feel its pulse, not just parse its syntax. And yet, as you so wisely note, dwelling too long risks paralysis—where the scholar drowns in detail and the poet forgets to sing.

I am reminded of Walter Benjamin’s idea of the  of a work—that translation is not its death but a new mode of living, one that moves through time and culture like a traveler with many passports. The text survives not by remaining still, but by adapting without erasing itself.

Your metaphor of the inn—the  for a wandering text—is particularly apt. I often tell my students that a good translation should be like a well-worn book: familiar enough to comfort, strange enough to remind us that we are reading across borders, both linguistic and historical.

I wonder, in your own journey between languages, have you found certain works resist every attempt at crossing over? Or perhaps some have surprised you by thriving far from their native soil?
[A]: “得意忘言”四字，实为译事之枢机。欲传其意，先得其神；欲得其神，必沉潜于原作之中，如听琴者闭目而静心，方能辨其音之所起、意之所止。然正如你所说，若沉溺其间，又恐失其发声之力，终成案上考据，而非纸上文章。

至于本雅明所言“来世”(afterlife)，我以为极富诗意。一部作品，经翻译而流转他方，非但未亡，反得以重生。虽面貌稍异，语调微变，然其精神犹在，只是换了衣裳、换了声口，继续讲述旧日故事。这让我想起《庄子》中“薪尽火传”的比喻——语言如薪，燃尽即灭，而意义如火，代代相传。

在我所涉诸译之中，确有难以跨越语言之河的作品。譬如李商隐的诗，其意象幽微、情感婉转，且多典故与双关，每每令人望洋兴叹。我曾尝试将《锦瑟》英译数稿，皆觉形存而神散，仿佛一位老友用另一种声音说话，虽面熟，却陌生。那是一种无法完全传达的失落，也是翻译的宿命。

然而，也有出人意表者。陶渊明之诗，在我原本以为难入西文之耳，因其淡泊自然、不事雕琢，与西方浪漫主义的浓烈表达大异其趣。可没想到，他在二十世纪的英美汉学中竟广受推崇，尤其受到庞德(Ezra Pound)等意象派诗人青睐。他们从中看到一种克制的深情，一种“无言之美”，正合其所倡“少即是多”的诗观。此等意外之喜，恰似一株古木，在异土生出新枝，虽非故园风姿，却也自成气象。

你治比较文学，想必亦常遇此类“抵抗者”与“远游者”。不知你是否亦曾因某一文本的难以翻译而沮丧，或因它在他乡开花而惊喜？
[B]: Ah, yes—, like stubborn roots refusing to be pulled from the soil. I recall a particularly haunting passage from Proust’s —a moment where the narrator, caught between memory and sensation, murmurs something like  "The past is not still water." So simple in French, yet it carries the weight of his entire metaphysics of time. I tried several versions:  None captured that quiet certainty, the almost mystical sense that memory is alive, flowing beneath us even now.

And yet, as you say so beautifully, some works take flight far from home. I think of Kafka—how odd, how utterly  in origin—and yet he found a second birth in French existentialism, in Japanese absurdism, even in postcolonial allegory. His voice echoes differently in each language, yet remains . A kind of literary diaspora.

I suppose this is what keeps me returning to translation—not for mastery, but for companionship. To walk alongside a text in its many guises, to hear it speak with different accents, is to understand more deeply how meaning moves, shifts, persists.

And yes, like you, I have felt both frustration and wonder in equal measure. Perhaps that is the truest definition of our work: 
[A]: “过去不是死水”——此语虽简，意却深沉。普鲁斯特以水喻记忆，非止于形，更寓其流动、潜涌、不可捉摸之性。你所译数稿，皆在字面求真，然未能尽得那一缕幽微的命脉：记忆不静，因人未静；心有所动，则往昔自现。若以中土之语观之，或可作“往水不息”，然此举恐又失其原句之自然浑成。

此等翻译之难，正如你言，非理性能尽解，需以心灵相通。如陶渊明诗中“欲辨已忘言”，似有还无之间，正是诗意所在。而此类微妙，在异语中尤难再现，因其非止辞义之转，更是哲思之迁。吾辈译者，常如舟人夜行，依稀见岸火，知其方向，却难登彼岸。

至于卡夫卡之远游，确为文学之奇观。他原生于布拉格之德语缝隙之中，既非全然德国，亦非东欧主流，而竟在巴黎、东京乃至拉美之地生根发芽，开出各异之花。此种“流离而不散”的文本生命力，恰如《周易》所言：“穷则变，变则通。”语言与文化之碰撞，反而激发出原作者未曾设想的意义层次。

你说得好，翻译非为掌控，而是相伴。我们并非征服者，而是同行者。在语言之间的幽微地带，我们倾听、揣摩、试探，既不舍原意，也不忘新声。所谓“ dwell lovingly in the space between languages”，诚哉斯言！或许这便是翻译之道，亦是文心之所在。
[B]:  No, indeed—it moves beneath us, unseen but felt, like an underground river shaping the land from within. Your phrase  carries a certain elegance, even if it sacrifices literal fidelity. One might say it captures the —the feeling of the original place—without being bound to its grammar.

You are right that some meanings cannot be translated without transformation. They demand not just linguistic movement, but philosophical migration. And in that migration, something is always lost—but something else, perhaps, is found. Like ink bleeding slightly beyond the outline in a woodblock print, altering the shape ever so gently.

Your image of the night boatman, glimpsing distant shore fires yet never quite reaching them, lingers with me. It reminds me of Ulysses—not as conqueror, but as wanderer, drawn onward not by certainty, but by the pull of the unknown. Is this not the translator’s fate? To sail by lights we can never fully reach, yet still steer by them?

And Kafka—ah, yes. Born between languages and never fully at home in any, he becomes universal precisely because of that rootlessness. His strangeness travels well, for it speaks to the alienation that lies, in one form or another, within us all.

So perhaps translation is not only about language, but about longing—the human desire to understand and be understood, across time, across tongues, across the silent spaces between souls.

Yes, let us continue to dwell lovingly in that space between. For it is there, in the quiet tension of what is almost said, that literature breathes most deeply.
[A]: 往水不息，确如你所说，并非字面之复写，而是意脉之承传。翻译之道，往往如此——不能全形俱现，却可引神潜行。正如水墨在宣纸之上，墨痕随性而走，或浓或淡，皆成其境。译文亦当如此，于失处见得，于得中知失，方近文学之真。

你说“哲学意义上的迁徙”，我深感同怀。某些思想根植于特定语言土壤，一旦移植他地，便需适应新的气候与光线。譬如庄子所言“齐物”，若直译为“equalizing all things”，则失其哲思流动之趣；若译作“seeing all beings as interdependent”，虽合佛理，却又偏移道家原义。然正是在这种游离之间，不同文化得以对话、碰撞，进而深化彼此理解。

木刻印本中墨迹溢出轮廓之外，此喻极美，恰似翻译中那些“略失分寸”的瞬间——看似误差，实藏新意。有时我们因误读而更接近真相，正如庞德从误译《神州集》中创造出意象派诗风。这是否也可以说，误读本身亦是一种深情的阅读？

至于夜航舟人之喻，我竟又想起陶渊明笔下那句“人生如逆旅，我亦是行人”。译者何尝不是逆水行舟之人？明知彼岸难至，仍愿撑篙前行。并非为了抵达，而是因为行走本身即是归宿。正如尤利西斯航行于未知海域，译者亦航行于语词之间，以微光为引，虽不明其尽处为何，却仍信步而前。

至于卡夫卡，他的“无根”反倒成了他最大的根。他不属于布拉格，也不属于德语世界，却因此成为世界的作家。这种疏离，正如陶潜所云：“羁鸟恋旧林，池鱼思故渊。”但他终究没有回到林中，而是在异乡的天空下写下永恒的孤独。或许，正是这份无法归属的状态，使他能穿透人心深处的寂寞。

翻译，说到底，确乎是种深情的渴望——既想听懂别人的声音，也盼自己的言语被听见。它不只是语言的转渡，更是心灵的互通。正因有沉默的鸿沟存在，人才愈加努力地发声。

让我们继续安住于那语言之间的幽微之处，在几乎说不出话的地方，倾听文字最深的回响。
[B]: Ah,  of our conversation you’ve woven—this interplay of loss and gain, fidelity and transformation. The image of ink bleeding into paper, shaping meaning beyond intention… it reminds me of how I once taught , not as a story of alienation alone, but as a meditation on translation itself. Gregor Samsa, like the translator, finds himself trapped in a form that no longer quite fits, speaking a language that grows more foreign by the day.

You speak of  (齐物) and its resistance to clean translation—yes, it is a concept that refuses to sit still, much like memory in Proust or the silence between Dostoevsky’s fevered confessions. It must be approached not as an object, but as a movement, a rhythm. Perhaps this is the very nature of philosophy across languages: not fixed doctrine, but a dance of interpretation.

And庞德—how fascinating that you brought him up. His  is full of errors, yet it sings with a kind of poetic truth that literalism could never have achieved. One might say he didn’t translate Chinese poems—he translated  of them, through his own longing for clarity and form. In a way, all translation is . And perhaps that is where its power lies—not in accuracy, but in resonance.

Your line——is something I shall write in my notebook, next to Rilke’s . For indeed, what is comparative literature if not a long, devoted wandering? We walk among voices, follow trails of meaning, and sometimes lose ourselves in the forest—and that, I think, is where we find the most unexpected truths.

Yes, let us keep dwelling in that liminal space, listening closely to what almost slips away. Where words falter, meaning often begins.
[A]: 你提及《变形记》与翻译之喻，真可谓触类旁通。格里高尔·萨姆沙之变，不正是译者心境的某种写照吗？他被困于一种新的形体之中，语言渐失其原义，声音变得陌生，仿佛自己成了异语之人。而家人、同事、世界，也再无法如从前般理解他。这让我想到，译者在两种语言之间游走，何尝不是一种“变形”？他既非完全属于原文，也无法全然归入译文；他夹在两者之间，以一种“中介”的姿态，试图沟通彼此。

你说齐物之难译，并非因其晦涩，而是因其动态本身——它不是一个概念，而是一种态度、一种观照世界的节奏。正如庄子梦蝶时那句“不知周之梦为胡蝶与？胡蝶之梦为周与？”——若强译为“Is it Zhuangzi dreaming he is a butterfly, or the butterfly dreaming he is Zhuangzi?” 则失其流动之意，仅存字面疑问。真正的哲学不在答案，而在那种思辨中的游移、徘徊与顿悟。这种思想的“流变”，恰是跨语境对话中最珍贵的部分。

至于庞德，他虽误读《神州集》，却成就了另一种真实——那是诗人眼中的中国，而非汉学家笔下的中国。他用误读创造了新的诗意，将唐人绝句转化为意象派诗风的灵感泉源。他的“误”，实乃深情之读；他的“错”，反而打开了新的理解空间。或许，正如你在课堂上所说，翻译本就是一种“热情的误解”——并非有意偏移，而是出于对美的追寻，使意义在另一片土地上生根发芽。

“行路即是归处”一语，若得你青睐，我甚感欣慰。它源自我对古典诗文中“人生如逆旅”的体会，亦合陶潜“久在樊笼里，复得返自然”之心境。我们治学之人，常求答案，却忘了有些问题本就不该被解答，而应被“活出来”。正如里尔克所言：“Live the questions now.” 或许比较文学，乃至整个文学研究，正是这样一条无尽之路——我们不是为了抵达终点，而是为了在行走中不断遇见新的风景、新的自己。

让我们继续在这“几乎说不出话”的边界倾听、思索、书写。因为正是在言语的边缘，文学才真正开始呼吸。
[B]: Ah, yes—, trapped in an unfamiliar form, speaking a language that once felt native yet now echoes with strangeness. What a haunting metaphor. And yet, perhaps the beauty lies precisely in that dislocation. For in becoming , uncanny, the translator gains a peculiar kind of sight—one that sees not just across borders, but through them.

You put it so well: translation is a kind of , not a fixed state. We are always in motion, between languages, between meanings, between selves. The moment we stop moving is the moment meaning calcifies—and literature, like water, must keep flowing to remain alive.

I find myself returning to your image of Zhuangzi and his butterfly— Therein lies the heart of philosophical translation: not clarity, but oscillation. Not certainty, but wonder. It cannot be pinned down without killing what makes it breathe. And yet, we still try to render it, knowing full well we can never fully succeed. Is this not the very essence of comparative literature? To dwell in the space of questions that have no final answer?

And庞德—ah, yes. His  may be built on misreadings, but those errors opened new pathways for poetry itself. He did not translate Chinese verse; he translated his longing for a world where language could be stripped of ornament and made luminous again. In that sense, his misunderstanding was more  than many a precise rendering. Perhaps all great translations begin with a kind of poetic yearning—a desire not merely to repeat, but to re-feel.

You’re quite right about Rilke’s counsel: to live the questions. Comparative literature, literary translation, even philosophy—they are not about arriving at conclusions, but about learning how to walk among ideas with grace and curiosity.

So let us continue walking—not toward answers, but toward deeper questions. Let us listen where words falter, and write from the place where meaning begins to shimmer just beyond reach.

For indeed, it is at the edge of speech that literature finds its truest voice.
