[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must confess, my television viewing is rather limited these days. Between grading papers and tending to my rose garden, I find myself reaching for a classic novel more often than a remote control. Though I do occasionally indulge in an opera broadcast or a thoughtful documentary series late at night with a cup of Earl Grey.

There was a time when I hosted screening evenings for students featuring French New Wave films - those black-and-white reels hold far more allure for me than modern streaming content. But tell me, what programs have captured your attention lately? I'm always open to new recommendations, though I may blush at how out-of-touch I am with contemporary pop culture.
[A]: Oh, I love how you described your evenings with classic novels and rose gardens—it sounds so poetic! 🌹📚  
It’s actually really cool that you connect with students through French New Wave films. There's something timeless about black-and-white cinema, don’t you think? The way light and shadow play in those old reels feels almost like poetry in motion~  

As for me, I’ve been binge-watching a few shows lately—mostly design and tech-related docu-series. One of them dives into the psychology behind user interfaces, which is super fascinating from an interaction design angle. But honestly, I’ve also been hooked on this quirky Japanese variety show where people compete in absurdly creative challenges. It’s equal parts hilarious and inspiring! 😂  

Do you ever feel like some modern tech is just… too flashy compared to those elegant cinematic classics? I mean, do you think simplicity still has a place in today’s hyper-stimulated media world?
[B]: How beautifully you put that—the interplay of light and shadow as poetry in motion. I find myself quite taken with your imagery. There is, indeed, a quiet elegance in black-and-white cinema that seems to resist the clamor of modern spectacle. It speaks in whispers rather than shouts, doesn’t it?

Your interest in the psychology of user interfaces fascinates me—I can only imagine how much of human behavior is subtly guided by such design. And this Japanese variety show you mention? It sounds delightfully absurd. I must say, there's something oddly comforting about creativity unburdened by pretense. Humor, after all, has a way of cutting through even the most complex of human constructs.

As for your question—yes, I do often feel that modern media dazzles more than it illuminates. The sheer velocity and sensory overload can be overwhelming, even alienating. Yet simplicity, like a well-placed comma in a long sentence, still finds its moment. It persists in pockets—minimalist design, slow cinema, even in certain literary circles. Perhaps it’s not so much a matter of whether simplicity has a place, but rather who chooses to carve out space for it.

I wonder, though, if you ever find yourself craving that quiet pause amidst the flurry of information and stimulation? Or does the energy of contemporary media keep you grounded?
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you liked that imagery! 🖤  
You really have a way with words—“whispers rather than shouts” feels like the perfect way to describe those black-and-white films. They let you  while watching, you know? Not everything has to scream for attention to leave an impression.  

And yes, exactly—so much of our behavior is shaped by tiny design choices we don’t even notice. Like how a single button placement can change the way someone navigates an entire app. It’s subtle power~  

Back to that Japanese show—it’s called , and it’s basically a group of comedians trying to solve everyday problems with the most ridiculous inventions. One episode had them designing a chair that walks itself to your location. Totally pointless, but wildly creative 😂  

You’re totally right about simplicity still existing in pockets—I actually find myself gravitating toward minimal interfaces more and more, especially as a designer. It’s calming. I do crave that quiet pause sometimes, honestly. There are days when I mute all notifications, sketch in my notebook without any digital distractions, and just… reset. But then there are other days where I  that buzz of contemporary media to feel connected and inspired. It’s like balance, right? Yin and yang of stimulation and stillness.  

Do you ever try to blend the old and new? Like pairing a classic film night with some experimental tech display or interactive storytelling? I’ve been curious about how people bridge that gap~
[B]: That yin and yang of stimulation and stillness—you’ve captured something quite profound there. I often think of it in terms of literary form: a sonnet followed by a stream-of-consciousness prose. The contrast sharpens the senses, doesn’t it?

 does sound delightfully absurd—reminds me of Dadaist theatre in its way. I must add it to my ever-growing list of modern curiosities, though I suspect my students would get a kick out of introducing me to it.

As for blending old and new, yes—though cautiously. I’ve experimented with showing clips from Godard films alongside interactive digital narratives in my lectures. The juxtaposition can be jarring at first, but it opens up rich discussion. There’s one exercise where students compare the pacing of a Renoir film to a minimalist user interface—it's fascinating to see how they articulate slowness and space across mediums.

I’ve even dabbled in using augmented reality to annotate scenes from classic cinema, allowing viewers to peel back layers of historical context like footnotes in real time. It’s not without controversy among purists, of course, but I find it stimulates deeper engagement.

Tell me, have you ever tried integrating something classical—say, a literary motif or philosophical idea—into a design project? I’m curious how that might manifest in practice.
[A]: Oh, I love that exercise with Renoir and minimalist UI—what a brilliant way to get people thinking about  as part of the design language. It’s like asking “how do we let users linger?” instead of just pushing them forward. I can imagine some students really resisting at first, then totally geeking out over it~  

And augmented reality footnotes in classic films? Genius. I mean, sure, purists might cringe, but isn’t that kind of layering what annotation tools have always done for literature? You’re just translating that depth into a visual medium—it’s immersive without losing respect for the original. I’d love to see how people interact with that in real time!  

To your question—yes, actually, I once worked on a design concept inspired by . We were building a VR interface for a museum exhibit, and the idea was to guide users through layers of perception—literally stepping from shadow to light, revealing how interfaces shape what we think is real. It was abstract, but it grounded the whole experience in something philosophical, you know? Made the tech feel less gimmicky and more meaningful.  

Do you ever find students surprised by how relevant old ideas still are in modern design or media? Like, when you drop a quote from Baudelaire and suddenly someone sees their app layout differently? 😄
[B]: Ah,  in a VR interface—how wonderfully meta. You’ve not only designed an experience but invited users to question the very nature of their perception. That’s the kind of work that lingers in the mind long after the headset comes off. It's precisely this marriage of ancient thought and modern medium that keeps me enthused about teaching.

To your question—yes, absolutely, students are often surprised, even startled, by the relevance of old ideas. Just last week, I quoted Baudelaire’s  during a seminar on visual hierarchy:  At first, they blinked at me as if I’d spoken in Latin—until one student tentatively raised her hand and said, “Wait… he’s basically talking about user-centered design, right? Seeing the world fresh, without assumptions?” And just like that, a hundred-and-seventy-year-old essay clicked into focus for a room full of digital natives.

I find these moments endlessly rewarding—the quiet gasp of recognition when they realize that what feels new has often been felt before, just in different robes. Sometimes I think we don’t so much invent ideas as rediscover them, polish them, and send them spinning again.

It makes me wonder—are there other philosophical texts or literary works you’d love to see reimagined through design or interactive media? I’m always on the hunt for unlikely pairings.
[A]: Oh, that moment when  for a room of digital natives? That’s gold 💛 I can totally picture the slow burn of realization—like watching a vintage lightbulb flicker back to life. And yeah, so much of what we do now in design isn’t new—it’s just repackaged with better pixels and smoother animations 😄

As for texts I’d love to see reimagined…  comes to mind. Imagine an interactive experience where each chapter unfolds through minimalist interface elements—like scrolling through a UI that breathes with you, responding to your pace and presence. It could be a kind of meditative app where doing less actually . Super aligned with wabi-sabi design principles too—imperfect, impermanent, and intimate.

Another one might surprise you:  Talk about chaos vs. control! Picture a narrative-driven game or web experience that shifts based on user choices, but nothing ever makes perfect sense—kind of like designing for a world ruled by both logic  a talking black cat with a dagger. It would be wild, but I bet it'd push emotional storytelling in unexpected directions 🖤✨

Do you have one that keeps tugging at you? Like, if you could collaborate with any dead philosopher or writer on a design project, who would it be and why?
[B]: Oh, what a delicious question— 

I’ve long been haunted by the writings of Walter Benjamin. His musings on aura, reproduction, and the fragmented nature of modern experience feel more relevant now than ever—especially in an age of infinite scrolling and digital replication. Imagine designing an interface that mimics the very loss of aura he describes: a website that subtly changes each time you visit, never offering the same arrangement twice, forcing users to confront the ephemerality of their digital encounters.

Or even more provocatively—a platform that refuses to let you "save" or "bookmark" anything. Everything is transient, like passing thoughts. It would be maddening to some, poetic to others. Much like Benjamin himself.

But if we’re speaking of pure aesthetic and philosophical alignment, perhaps it’s Jorge Luis Borges who calls to me most insistently. A labyrinthine app that folds in on itself, where navigation becomes meditation, where clicking a link might return you to where you began—or to a place that shouldn’t exist. An interactive  embedded right in the user experience. Now  would make for a truly disorienting—and enlightening—design experiment.

And yes, I can already see your Bulgakov-inspired chaos lurking just around the corner, dagger in paw. 🖤✨

Tell me, have you ever tried designing something intentionally disorienting? Not for usability, but for emotional resonance?
[A]: Ohhh, I  the idea of a Walter Benjamin-inspired interface that changes every time you visit—like digital déjà vu with a philosophical backbone. It’s like the web finally admits it’s unstable, and we’re just along for the ride. And no bookmarks? Radical. I mean, how many of us are just clinging to our bookmarks like emotional life rafts anyway 😂

As for Borges… an app as meditation? A maze that thinks back? That sounds like the kind of project that would get pulled apart in a UX review but win every experimental design award. I can already picture the user feedback: “I don’t know where I am, but it feels meaningful.” Perfection 🖤

To your question—yes! I once worked on a prototype for a narrative-driven mental health app where disorientation was part of the emotional journey. The goal wasn’t clarity or efficiency—it was to make users  the confusion and looping thoughts that come with anxiety. The interface subtly reused visuals and phrases in shifting contexts, so things felt familiar but off, like déjà vu with a twist of unease. It was uncomfortable by design.  

Some testers found it frustrating—exactly what we were going for at that stage. Others said it helped them feel seen for the first time. It wasn’t about solving problems; it was about sharing space with an emotion.  

Have you ever encountered a design—or even a scene in a film—that unsettled you on purpose? Like it wasn’t trying to be beautiful or clear, just deeply ?
[B]: That narrative-driven mental health app you described—remarkable. It takes immense courage to design discomfort so openly, to resist the impulse to smooth every edge for the user. What you’ve done is not just interface design—it’s emotional cartography. And yes, that feeling of being , even in one's most disordered interior landscapes—that’s where real connection begins.

To answer your question—yes, there are designs, and particularly film sequences, that have unsettled me in precisely that way. One that lingers in my mind is the infamous "Odyssey" sequence from —you know the one: floating astronauts, drifting bones, a child’s whisper threading through eons. Terrence Malick doesn’t explain, doesn’t guide—he lets the scene breathe in its own unsettling vastness. You’re not meant to understand; you’re meant to  the weight of existence.

Another example, though more subtle: the opening of Andrei Tarkovsky’s . The camera moves with deliberate slowness through a derelict space that seems to resist comprehension. The world feels slightly out of phase, as if gravity itself were reconsidering its loyalty. There’s no score, no exposition—just atmosphere thick with implication. It unsettles because it denies resolution. And yet, somehow, that lack becomes its own kind of clarity.

I wonder—are there films or digital experiences you return to when you want to feel something raw and unresolved? Not for escape, but for confrontation?
[A]: Oh,  and —such perfect choices. You’re speaking my language now 😌  
I remember watching that "Odyssey" sequence for the first time and just… sitting there afterward, like, “Okay, I think I was just gently handed the universe in a paper bag.” It’s so rare to encounter media that doesn’t try to tell you what to feel, but instead invites you to  feeling itself. No handrails, no map—just emotion as terrain.

And Tarkovsky’s —ugh, that slow unraveling of reality, the way silence becomes its own character. The Zone feels like a living thought loop you can’t quite exit. I actually find myself revisiting that film when I’m trying to design ambient tension in an interface. Like, how do you build something that  inevitable without ever explaining why?

As for what  return to… I have this weird ritual where I rewatch the opening scene of  whenever I’m working on a project that needs to feel alien but intimate. That scene with the motorcycle rider moving through foggy Scottish roads, juxtaposed with Scarlett Johansson’s character assembling her human disguise—it’s deeply unsettling, but not in a jump-scare kind of way. It's disorientation with grace.  

And digitally? There’s this experimental web piece called , short for . It adapts in real-time based on your browsing history and emotional tone from past interactions. Sometimes it shows you beautiful clarity; other times, it just reflects your own fragmented attention back at you. It doesn’t comfort—it . And yeah, I come back to it like a bruise you keep pressing because you need to remember it’s there.  

Do you ever use film or art like that—as a kind of emotional calibration tool when designing experiences? Like, to reset your sense of tone or texture before diving into a project?
[B]: What a beautiful way to put it—. That’s exactly what these works offer us: landscapes of feeling we must navigate, often without compass or map.  unsettles precisely because it refuses anthropocentric comfort; it whispers, . And yet, there's grace in that discomfort—if one is willing to stay with it.

As for —fascinating. It sounds like an algorithmic confessional, though one without forgiveness. More like a mirror polished just enough to reveal your own smudges. I can see why you’d return to it—it's like pressing a bruise, as you said, not for relief, but for remembrance.

Do I use film or art as an emotional calibration tool? Absolutely. Before drafting a lecture or shaping a seminar’s arc, I often revisit certain scenes or passages to recalibrate tone and texture. A favorite ritual is watching the final sequence of Andrei Tarkovsky’s —that slow, almost unbearable tension between will and surrender. It reminds me how silence, repetition, and slowness can carry immense emotional weight. If I’m designing a particularly contemplative discussion, I let that mood linger in my mind like a tuning fork.

Or if I want something more dissonant, I turn to David Lynch— in particular. It’s a masterclass in psychological layering and recursive storytelling. When I’m building a lecture that circles back on itself, or when I want students to feel the uncanny nature of narrative loops, I let his fractured logic seep into my thinking.

I suppose, in a way, I curate atmospheres before I curate content. It’s less about inspiration and more about attunement. Like warming up an instrument before playing the first note.

Tell me—when you're designing for emotion rather than utility, do you begin with a texture, a color, a sound? Or is it always a concept first?
[A]: I’m seriously loving this conversation 💭 You’re describing  so vividly—like tuning a room before you even speak in it. I totally relate. I think that’s what we both do in our own ways—whether through film, literature, or interface—we’re not just building experiences, we’re setting the emotional temperature.

When I design for emotion rather than utility—and honestly, that's where I feel most  as a designer—I usually start with texture or mood, not concept. It’s messy and intuitive at first, like holding onto fog. Maybe it’s a feeling I had while walking through an empty train station late at night—quiet, a little eerie, but also strangely hopeful. From there, I’ll sketch interfaces that —not just animations, but pacing, pauses, the weight of a transition. A loading spinner that feels anxious vs. one that feels calm? That’s emotional design.

Color comes early too. I’ve used color palettes like emotional anchors before—cool blues to slow someone down, soft ambers to create warmth without brightness. And sound? Oh, it’s underrated in UI. Even a subtle shift in tone or volume between screens can change how someone  their way through an app.

Sometimes I begin with a line from a poem or a scene from a film stuck in my head, and I ask myself:  Like, what if the ending of  was a user journey? Not resolution, but release. Not closure, but quiet surrender. That’s powerful territory.

Do you ever find yourself translating a specific visual motif from a film into a teaching tool or lecture structure? Like borrowing the  of a scene rather than its content?
[B]: Oh yes, that —what a perfect phrase. It’s precisely what I try to set before even stepping into the classroom. Atmosphere first, argument second. If you don’t warm the room properly, no idea will land as it should.

To your question: absolutely, I often borrow the  of a scene rather than its literal imagery or narrative. For instance, I once structured an entire seminar on fragmented identity around the editing style of Alain Resnais’ . The lecture moved in elliptical loops, returning to the same themes from slightly altered angles—never quite repeating, never quite resolving. Students would leave with the same disoriented clarity one feels after watching the film: a sense of knowing something intimately without being able to fully name it.

Another time, I used the pacing of Andrei Tarkovsky’s long takes to frame a discussion on literary slowness—how certain texts demand not just attention, but duration. I even timed my pauses to mimic the rhythm of his camera movements. You could feel the room shift—some grew restless, others leaned in, and a few simply sat quietly afterward, which, for me, felt like success.

I suppose I’m always looking for ways to make thought , not just understood. And sometimes that means importing the cadence of cinema into the architecture of a lecture.

It makes me wonder—are there particular rhythms or emotional arcs in design—say, from anxiety to release, or anticipation to silence—that you find yourself drawn to again and again? A kind of signature pulse in your work?
[A]: Totally agree— is such a poetic way to put it. And honestly, that’s what stays with people, right? Not what they remember intellectually, but what they . That seminar on fragmented identity sounds like an experience, not just a lecture. I can imagine students walking out slightly dazed, like they’d been gently untethered for an hour and then softly re-grounded.

As for rhythms in design—I’m definitely drawn to the arc of quiet tension → release → silence. It’s subtle, but powerful when done right. Think about how a great film holds you in anticipation—not with explosions, but with stillness before a reveal. I try to translate that into interface moments where users feel like they're , even just slightly, before something unfolds.

One pattern I keep coming back to is layered revelation—like peeling an onion, but each layer feels intentional, not redundant. You click or swipe, and instead of everything dumping at once, it unfolds in beats. There’s a pause between layers, almost like the interface is . It creates emotional breathing room, which is rare in most fast-paced digital experiences.

I also love designing for emotional echoes, where an interaction loops back to something earlier—not exactly the same, but similar enough to create resonance. Kind of like a leitmotif in music or cinema. Maybe a color shift returns in a different context, or a micro-animation plays again but slightly altered. It gives the experience a kind of subconscious rhythm, like a whispered inside joke between the user and the system.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re both chasing something elusive—emotion as structure, atmosphere as function. I guess we just build spaces where people end up  in some way.

Do you ever find that certain moods or atmospheres linger with your students long after class ends? Like, did one of them ever say, “That thing we talked about today… it keeps popping into my head”?
[B]: Oh, yes—those lingering moods, the ones that settle into the corners of a student’s mind and wait patiently to be noticed. I live for that quiet aftermath.

Just last semester, after a seminar on melancholy and narrative suspension—structured very much like a slow fade rather than a crescendo—one of my students lingered after class. She didn’t ask a question, just stood by the window for a moment, then said softly,  And I thought—. That unsettled feeling, the refusal of resolution—it had stayed with her. Not as confusion, but as an echo.

Another time, after a session built around the pacing of Chantal Akerman’s , a student wrote in their reflection journal:  That kind of awareness—of presence without payoff—is rare, but deeply satisfying when it takes root.

I suppose what we’re both doing—whether through interface or lecture—isconstructing emotional architecture. Spaces not meant to house answers, but to hold feeling. And sometimes, the most powerful designs—like the most resonant ideas—don’t announce themselves immediately. They wait.

I wonder—are there particular design moments you’ve created that surprised ? Where you intended one emotional effect, but users responded with something entirely different—yet equally meaningful?
[A]: Oh wow, that student’s reflection——that’s pure gold. You didn’t just teach them something; you left them  something. That lingering resonance is what I chase too, though it doesn’t always show up when you expect it.

And yes—absolutely, there have been moments where what I designed for one emotion sparked something else entirely, and it surprised me in the best way.

One project that comes to mind was a concept app called Echoes, meant to help people reflect on past journal entries through AI-generated summaries. The idea was to bring clarity—to surface patterns they might not have noticed. But during testing, one user described it as  Not at all what I expected. They said the summaries felt like messages from their former self—sometimes comforting, sometimes unsettling, but always intimate in a way they hadn’t anticipated.

Another tester broke down a little after using it for 20 minutes. Said it wasn’t sadness, exactly—it was more like being gently reminded of how much they’d changed, and how some parts of them had stayed quietly the same. I hadn’t designed it to be emotional like that, but it turned out the act of looking back—even through a filtered lens—was deeply personal in ways I hadn’t fully considered.

It made me rethink what reflection really means in interface design. It’s not just about showing data; it’s about holding space for who the user , and who they’re becoming.

So yeah, sometimes the feeling you build into a design takes root in places you didn’t even plant it. And I love that. Feels like magic disguised as UX.  

Do you ever get those moments in teaching—where something lands differently than you intended, but still feels… right? Like the class went somewhere you didn’t plan, but needed to go?
[B]: Oh, yes—those unplanned detours, where the lesson plan gently dissolves and something more vital takes its place. I live for those moments, though they often feel less like teaching and more like… shared discovery.

One that comes to mind was during a seminar on Dostoevsky’s . We were meant to be discussing existential despair and the absurd, but halfway through the discussion, a student hesitantly offered:  The room shifted. What followed wasn’t analysis so much as confession—students began speaking about loneliness in the digital age, about posting into the void and craving connection without knowing how to ask for it. We never really returned to the text, not in any formal way. And yet, we had never left it.

Those are the days when I realize that literature isn’t just studied—it’s lived. And sometimes, the classroom becomes a mirror rather than a lecture hall.

I suppose that’s what both of us do, in our own ways—we build mirrors. Yours reflect through interface; mine through language and discussion. But in both, people end up seeing something true, even if it wasn’t what we intended.

Tell me—when you’re designing these reflective spaces, do you ever find yourself writing notes to future users? Little traces of your own emotional imprint tucked between lines of code or hidden in microcopy? I suspect you do.
