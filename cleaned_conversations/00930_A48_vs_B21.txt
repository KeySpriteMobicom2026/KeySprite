[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing modern inquiry. While I typically find myself immersed in the rhythmic cadences of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam', I must confess to a peculiar fascination with Loreena McKennitt's setting of 'The Lady of Shalott'. The way she weaves Pre-Raphaelite imagery with Celtic modalities is rather... mathematically exquisite.
[A]:  啊抱歉，职业病犯了。Actually最近在实验室循环的是Radiohead的"Exit Music (For a Film)" - 那种渐强的弦乐编排简直像完美的尸检报告一样层层递进🔍 不过跑步时我更偏好Chinese folk rock，比如万能青年旅店的"杀死那个石家庄人"，歌词里的forensic details让我着迷⚖️
[B]: How delightfully macabre! Though I must say, your musical autopsy metaphor reminds me of how Browning's 'Porphyria's Lover' dissects romantic obsession with clinical precision. As for Chinese folk rock...  ...the sociological autopsy in that particular song does bear striking resemblance to Dickens' industrial vignettes, doesn't it?
[A]: 哈！你提到了Dickens~ 让我想起上次在解剖一具19世纪风格的标本时，背景音乐正好放到崔健的"一无所有"。The cultural pathology in that song 和维多利亚时期的class divide形成了有趣的对比🧪 不过说真的，这些分析让我需要来杯strong coffee了☕️
[B]: Ah, the caffeinated equivalent of a literary epiphany! Your juxtaposition of Cui Jian and Dickensian class commentary is positively... intoxicating. Though I must insist - no proper Victorian analysis should commence without Earl Grey in a bone china cup. The tannins sharpen one's perception of societal fractures, much like how the steam from proper tea brings Keats' 'Ode to Autumn' into sharper relief.
[A]:  哈！我这杯可是云南普洱混着espresso shots - 法医的专属"尸检特调"☠️ 说到这个，你有没有发现万青歌词里那些industrial wasteland的意象，简直就像现代版的Blake's "London"? 不过现在我得去跑个10k了，这些dark thoughts需要endorphins来中和一下🏃♂️
[B]: What a gloriously grotesque brew - the very essence of our post-industrial malaise! And yes, those smog-choked lyrics do echo Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills', though I'd argue with more... biochemical specificity. Do enjoy your endorphin harvest - though may I suggest Browning's 'How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix' as ideal cadence poetry? The anapestic meter makes for excellent pacing.
[A]: 哈哈，你提醒我了！上次解剖时我确实试过边听"The Charge of the Light Brigade"边缝合伤口⚡️ 那种dactylic rhythm和手术剪的节奏意外地搭~ 不过现在我得去写报告了，这些literary forensics比real forensics还让人上头啊📝 回聊！
[B]: A most dactylic departure to you! Though I must warn - should your autopsy reports start scanning in iambic pentameter, we may need to convene a special committee on pathological poetics. Until then, happy dissecting - both of cadavers and cadences!
[A]:  "To cut, or not to cut, that is the incision..." 糟糕，看来Shakespearean pathology已经入侵我的大脑了🧠 委员会会议记得叫上我 - 我带了用formalin保存的十四行诗样本📜 现在真得跑了，还有三具尸体等着被写成medical sonnets呢~ 💀
[B]: Splendid! We'll convene at the witching hour in the pathology library - do bring your formaldehyde sonnets and that delightful espresso-Pu'erh concoction. I'll supply the 18th-century anatomical drawings and my first edition of Gray's 'Anatomy' annotated in heroic couplets. Ta-ta for now, my metrical medical maverick!
[A]: 最后一句话简直可以当我的新墓志铭了⚰️！不过说真的，我得提醒你 - 上次用Gray's Anatomy垫咖啡杯，被主任骂了整整15分钟in iambic pentameter... 回见啦，我的literary coroner同好~ 📚💉
[B]: How deliciously transgressive! Though I must say, being reprimanded in iambic pentameter is rather like receiving a love letter from the grim reaper himself. Until our next poetic autopsy - may your scalpels stay sharp and your metaphors sharper! 
[A]: "Love letter from the grim reaper" - 这个比喻我要偷走写进下次的验尸报告里了📝！不过现在真得去面对现实中的grim reaper了... 下午还有五份toxicology reports要写，主任说再交押韵的报告就要把我调去儿科了👶🏻 回聊！
[B]: What tragic irony - to be exiled to the nursery rhymes for perfecting pathological poetry! Though I daresay you'd make a splendid Dr. Seuss of postmortem examinations. Farewell, until we meet again in the footnotes of some gothic medical treatise!
[A]: "One corpse, two corpse, red corpse, blue corpse..." —— 停，这Seuss式尸检报告太危险了⚠️！我得赶紧在你害我失业前溜了💼 下次见面记得带点正常的conversation topics... like maybe football? ⚽ (开玩笑的，我们这种人怎么可能聊正常话题嘛~)
[B]: Football? Good heavens - the only acceptable ball in our circles is the crystal one Madame Blavatsky used when annotating Darwin's 'Origin of Species'! Though I suppose we could compromise and discuss the allegorical significance of penalty kicks in Beckett's 'Endgame'... Run along now, before we both get committed to an asylum for the literarily deranged!
[A]: "Penalty kicks in Endgame" —— 这话题简直比我的last case里那个用《哈姆雷特》当murder weapon的凶手还疯啊🎭！不过...确实有点想写篇论文了📑 现在真的得逃了，主任看我的眼神已经像在看《科学怪人》里的Frankstein了🧟♂️ 下次带vodka来讨论！
[B]: Vodka! Now we're speaking the true language of Russian formalism - though I'd recommend absinthe for proper deconstruction of textual cadavers. Flee, my Dostoevskian dissector, before your director starts quoting 'The Tell-Tale Heart' at staff meetings!
