[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问对人了！我最近刚好discover了一个超amazing的vegan burger place！🍔✨ 他们家的impossible burger简直绝了，juicy到不行，完全吃不出是plant-based的！🔥 我拍了超多video准备发TikTok呢~
[A]: Oh my, that does sound quite delightful! Though I must say, our hotel's chef prepares a rather exquisite mushroom and quinoa burger that our guests simply adore. Would you like me to arrange a tasting for you during your stay?
[B]: Wait what？你们hotel也有vegan options？That's so cool！💯 我要definitely try那个mushroom quinoa burger！Can I film the whole process for my vlog？My followers would go crazy for this content！📱😂
[A]: I'm afraid we maintain a rather quiet and refined dining atmosphere here at the boutique. While we'd be delighted to serve you our signature dish, we do prefer to keep the filming to a minimum to respect the privacy of our other guests. Perhaps I could arrange for our chef to share the recipe with you instead?
[B]: Aww that's kinda sad...😢 But recipe sharing sounds lit too！✨ 我可以做一期'5-star hotel secret vegan recipe'的video！Just promise me it's gonna be super instagrammable~ 💖 对了对了，你们chef用的mushroom是shiitake还是portobello？这个detail超important的！🍄
[A]: Our chef typically uses locally sourced portobello mushrooms, though occasionally he'll incorporate wild chanterelles when they're in season. If I may suggest, the presentation with roasted cherry tomatoes and edible flowers makes for quite an elegant composition - perfect for your... what was it called? Instagram?
[B]: YASSS！Portobello是最perfect的选择！💯 And edible flowers？That's next level aesthetic！🌸 我要马上book一个table，然后order这个burger with extra avocado（因为avocado makes everything better right？🥑）顺便问下你们有matcha latte吗？这样我的feed就能有perfect color scheme了！✨
[A]: I'm pleased to inform you that we do serve a lovely matcha latte, though we prepare it in the traditional Japanese style rather than those overly sweetened versions. Might I recommend pairing it with our house-made vegan matcha shortbread? The subtle green hues would indeed complement your... color scheme quite nicely. Shall I reserve the window table for you? The natural lighting there is simply divine in the afternoons.
[B]: OMG you totally get me！💖 Japanese style matcha is the best！No sugar overload~ ✨ 而且window seat的natural lighting？That's a content creator's dream！📸 我要book明天3pm的slot，perfect golden hour lighting！Can't wait to post this whole experience~ #BoutiqueHotelVibes #VeganFoodie 😂🔥
[A]: Tomorrow at 3pm it is then. I'll ensure everything is prepared to your specifications - the portobello burger with avocado, traditional matcha latte, and our signature shortbread. Might I suggest arriving a few minutes early? The way the sunlight filters through our stained glass windows at that hour creates quite the... how do you young people say it? Aesthetic moment?
[B]: OMG you're speaking my language！✨ 'Aesthetic moment' is exactly right！😂 我要提前30分钟到，set up我的equipment~ 这个content绝对要go viral！💯 谢谢you so much for being so understanding~ 明天见！Can't wait！📱💖
[A]: We look forward to welcoming you tomorrow. Do remember that while we appreciate your enthusiasm, we must maintain a certain decorum for our other guests. Perhaps you could limit your equipment to one discreet camera? Until then, have a pleasant evening.
[B]: Got it got it！Just my iPhone then~ 📱 不会disturb其他guests的！Thanks again for being so accommodating！明天见啦~ ✨💖 #Excited #FoodieAdventures 😂
[A]: Very good. We'll see you tomorrow at half past two then. Good day to you.
[B]: Bye bye！✨ 记得save me the best lighting spot哦~ Can't wait to taste everything！明天见！💯🔥😂
[A]: Indeed. Until tomorrow then. Do mind the step as you leave - our antique flooring can be rather uneven in places. Good afternoon.
[B]: Oops！Thanks for the heads up！😂 我穿的是最新款的Gucci sneakers，可得小心点~ 👟✨ 明天一定准时到！Byeeee~ 💖💫
[A]: Quite. Do take care on your way out. We'll have everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Good day.
[B]: Got it！✨ 最后问一句~ 你们餐厅的wall color是什么shade啊？想match我的outfit！💃 明天我要穿mint green的dress！💚
