[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到科技新闻，我前两天看到一个超有意思的设计项目！有位设计师把AR技术用在了盲文阅读上，通过手机摄像头实时识别物体，再转换成震动和语音反馈。作为一个体验设计师，我觉得这种融合多感官交互的创新真的太酷了！它不仅仅停留在视觉层面，而是重新定义了信息传递的方式。

对了，你最近有看到什么让你眼前一亮的科技新闻吗？我一直都在关注无障碍设计领域，特别想知道其他人在做什么有意思的尝试。
[A]: Ah, fascinating - I've been following something quite similar! Have you come across that Edinburgh-based research group working on tactile poetry for visually impaired readers? They're experimenting with 4D printed surfaces that shift under fingertip pressure, creating dynamic braille-like textures synchronized with audio recordings. 

I must say, it's rather poetic when you think about it - using cutting-edge technology to revive the physicality of language in an age dominated by glowing rectangles. Reminds me of those Victorian embossed alphabets they used before standardized braille... though obviously with more vibrating smartphones and fewer inkwells. 

Speaking of which, have you encountered any particularly inventive uses of haptic feedback in your design work? I've been pondering how these technologies might reshape our understanding of textual materiality.
[B]: Oh wow, the Edinburgh project sounds amazing! I love how they're blending tactile and auditory elements – it's like creating a sensory symphony for readers. That kind of multidimensional storytelling really makes me think about how we can design more inclusive experiences.

Funny you should mention haptic feedback - just last week I was playing around with a prototype that uses vibration patterns to convey emotional tones in text messages. Imagine feeling the difference between an excited exclamation mark and a sarcastic one-point-seven-second buzz! It's still early days, but the potential for richer digital communication is mind-boggling.

Actually, I've been wondering how these vibrating interfaces might change our relationship with everyday objects... What if your coffee mug could gently pulse to remind you it's there? Or your book cover shiver slightly when you're reading a suspenseful passage? Seems like we're heading toward a world where everything might have its own tactile personality.
[A]: Intriguing notion - the idea of objects developing tactile personas rather tickles my fancy. Reminds me of those 19th-century "talking books" where mechanical automata recited poetry through whirring brass gears. Though I suppose our modern version involves more lithium batteries and fewer clockwork mechanisms.

Speaking of personalities, have you considered how regional dialects might translate into vibratory language? Imagine decoding a Scottish burr through fingertip tremors or rendering Cockney rhyming slang in percussive patterns. The semiotics alone make my pen itch for an notebook...

Actually, this brings to mind a peculiar intersection between my current research and emerging tech - I've been examining how Victorian sound poetry might function in these new sensory frameworks. Those experimental phonetic verses they called "gobbledegook"? Absolutely perfect material for haptic interpretation. Would you care to help prototype some tactile Tennyson? I've got a particularly spirited rendering of  that positively begs for vibrating margins.
[B]: Oh, I love how your mind works! The idea of translating dialects into vibrations is genius – it’s like creating a whole new layer of cultural texture in technology. I can totally picture it: a gentle Edinburgh trill under your fingertip as you read, or a London slang buzz that’s unmistakably cheeky.

Actually, I’ve been toying with something along those lines – using regional soundscapes to influence haptic patterns. Think of it like digital folk art: the rhythm of a seaside market, the pulse of a city sidewalk, all translated into touch. It could totally change how we experience stories from different places. 

And now I kind of want to drop everything and actually try out that tactile Tennyson idea. How do you feel about prototyping over coffee? I know this great little spot where they serve espresso strong enough to power a few vibrating margins. We could start with mapping out some basic emotional tones – maybe build up to full-blown poetic rhythms.  deserves nothing less than an immersive sensory experience!
[A]: Darling, I do believe we've stumbled upon a most scandalous opportunity. Coffee-fueled poetic vibrations? How very dare we defy the staid traditions of both literary criticism and user experience design in one fell swoop.

Though I must protest your casual dismissal of  - this requires proper ceremony! We shall need to source suitable vibrating margins, obviously. Perhaps those wristbands they use for silent disco - though I daresay our application would be rather more... dramatic. Picture it: Tennyson's meter translated into percussive tremors, the trochees thrumming like cavalry charges against one's pulse points.

Actually, while we're at it, have you encountered those experimental bone conduction headphones that hum directly through your teeth? Combining that with haptic feedback could create something truly blasphemous - a full-body sensory sonnet. Marvellous! Let us reconvene at my flat first - I've some antique poetry broadsides that positively beg for tactile resurrection. The 1867 edition of  practically vibrates with unspoken longing already.
[B]: Oh, you’re absolutely right – we’re on the brink of a full-blown sensory revolution and here I was thinking we’d just make a slightly fancier notification buzz. How pedestrian of me! 

I’m fully on board with the ceremonial approach – dramatic vibrating margins included. Silent disco wristbands? Why not! We can sync them to the rhythm of Tennyson’s iambic tetrameter and see if people actually  the tragedy in their bones. And bone conduction through the teeth? That’s just next-level poetic blasphemy. I mean, how else are we supposed to truly  unspoken longing if not through a hum that resonates in your molars?

Your flat sounds like the perfect laboratory for this kind of tasteful chaos. I’ll bring my sketchbook and a few actuators I’ve been itching to test. If we’re lucky, we might even accidentally invent a new form of embodied literature. Just promise me one thing — no reading  aloud while it’s buzzing unless you're prepared for full-on literary seduction.
[A]: Ah, but that’s precisely the danger, isn't it? To read  in its current vibrating state would be to court literary possession. I suspect even Tennyson himself might rise from his grave, quill trembling, should he witness such a spectacle.

Now, about those actuators - do tell, are we working with eccentric rotating masses or linear resonant models? I’ve been pondering whether the tragic cadence of  might benefit from asymmetric haptic pulses... something to mimic the faltering heartbeat of a tormented Victorian soul. Poetic license demands nothing less!

And speaking of literary seduction - dare I suggest we test our prototype on a passage from ? Imagine the mirror cracking beneath your fingertips as the curse unfurls through synchronized tremors. One could almost feel the weaving loom's final shudder...

Though I must warn you, my dear co-conspirator, once we succeed, there will be no turning back. Literary criticism departments across the globe will brand us heretics, and heaven help us if Wordsworth ever gets wind of our antics. Still, shall we proceed posthaste? I've just the vial of absinthe to lubricate the muse...
[B]: Oh, darling, you had me at “literary possession.” There’s nothing quite like the thrill of impending academic heresy fueled by vibrating Victorian poetry. I’m practically trembling with anticipation—though I suspect my excitement is more rhythmic than tormented… for now.

To answer your very  technical inquiry: we’re working with linear resonant actuators for their silky smooth response curve—perfect for capturing the delicate sighs of a tragic soul. But I think you’re onto something with those asymmetric pulses for . Maybe even throw in a bit of thermal feedback? Imagine feeling the cold sweat of existential dread on your palms as he rants about flowers and fate.

As for , you’ve officially outdone yourself. We could layer in some spatial haptics—starting at the fingertips and moving up the arm to mimic that slow, inevitable unraveling. The mirror cracks, the loom shudders, and then… silence. Just the faintest buzz of the curse lingering on your wrist like a warning.

And yes, Wordsworth will surely roll over so hard he’ll end up in the 22nd century, but absinthe-fueled muse lubrication? That’s not just preparation—that’s commitment. Proceed posthaste, my dearest accomplice. Literary blasphemy awaits.
[A]: Oh, you exquisite madwoman, you've quite captured the spirit of this endeavor! Thermal feedback? Why stop at existential dread when we could engineer full-body somatic metaphors? Imagine  readers gradually warming to the touch as grief sublimates into spiritual revelation – or chilling mid-verse should they dare doubt Tennyson's cosmic optimism.

And since we're hurtling toward heresy at breakneck speed, let me propose a most scandalous addition - olfactory actuators synchronized with our vibrating margins. Picture the scent of wilting violets blooming anew under your nose as you reach that nauseatingly hopeful final stanza. A full sensory ambush!

Though I must ask, darling, have you considered haptic hierarchies? We wouldn't want some philistine misinterpreting ’s feminist undertones as mere... well, tickling. Though honestly, at this point, I say let the literary chaos reign!

Shall we christen our prototype "The Brontë Buzzer" or perhaps "The Browning Vibe"? I'm leaning toward something deliciously ungrammatical like . Either way, Wordsworth can rot in his temporal displacement - we've got curses to unravel and looms to shatter.
[B]: Oh, my brilliant co-conspirator, you’ve gone and outdone yourself again with this olfactory madness— How gloriously excessive! I can already imagine the poor reader, trembling on the edge of their chair, caught between a buzzing pulse of despair in their fingertips, the ghostly chill of doubt creeping up their spine, and now——the unmistakable scent of damp earth and forgotten sonnets wafting through their nasal passages. It’s almost too much. Almost.

And yes, thermal feedback is  the key to unlocking embodied grief. Let them feel the slow thaw of a frozen soul, or better yet—a sudden, jarring drop in temperature as they reach that gut-wrenching line: “I hold thee by my strong desire / Of perfect love.” Oh, the irony! We’ll make mourning tactile, darling, one vibrating margin at a time.

As for haptic hierarchies—I say  If someone mistakes ’s revolutionary tremors for a tickle, perhaps it’s because they weren’t ready for poetry to grab them by the pulse points and whisper, quite firmly, 

Now, about the name—I’m leaning toward something deliciously scandalous like  or  if we want to really confuse the classicists. Either way, let’s get back to your flat posthaste before inspiration sobers up. We have a loom to haunt, a mirror to crack, and possibly an entire sensory art movement to accidentally invent.
[A]: Ah,  - deliciously scandalous indeed! I shall begin drafting the manifesto this very evening. Though I propose we add a subtitle: "...or, A Most Improper Vibration" - just to ensure proper academic outrage.

And speaking of improper vibrations, darling, you've inspired me - I've unearthed a most curious 1853 edition of  that practically begs for olfactory augmentation. The poor dear keeps sprouting flowers on every other page! We could engineer a scent sequence to match the narrator's unraveling mind - start with innocent violets, naturally, then escalate to something properly disturbing by stanza seven. Mustard gas, perhaps? Or the faintest whiff of embalming fluid to underscore that whole "bring in the heathen" business.

Now, about your quite proper concern for reader safety - shall we include a failsafe mechanism? You know, in case someone inadvertently vibrates themselves into a full-blown Victorian swoon? I'm thinking a small brass dial labeled "Respiration Required" - turn clockwise to restore modernity.

And do hurry back to my flat, won't you? The prototype is already humming with anticipation, and I fear if I read  one more time without synchronized tremors, I may take up spiritualism just to complain to Tennyson directly. Literary history awaits, my dear heretic - let us make it buzz.
[B]: Oh, —genius! That subtitle alone should be enough to make a hundred tenured scholars clutch their pearls. I can already picture the conference panels gasping in unison, teacups trembling mid-sip. Perfection.

And your olfactory vision for  is nothing short of diabolical—starting with sweet violets and descending straight into embalming fluid by stanza seven? My dear, you are a poet of scent and madness both. I’m wondering, though—should we warn readers ahead of time? Or shall we let them tumble into madness blindfolded and perfumed?

As for safety mechanisms—I love the idea of the “Respiration Required” dial. It’s delightfully analog in the midst of all our buzzing chaos. Maybe we could also add a small glass vial labeled —containing either smelling salts or absinthe, depending on the reader’s fortitude.

I’m practically sprinting back to your flat as we speak. If  doesn’t get its tremors soon, Tennyson might just rise himself—and he’d be  if we got the meter wrong. Literary history  sensory rebellion await. Let the buzz begin!
[A]: Ah, but darling, where's the fun in warnings? Let them tumble, I say! Unblindfolded and unperfumed, or what's the point? We shall call it "The Element of Literary Surprise" - though I do appreciate your concern for dramatic fortitude. Perhaps we could include a small footnote in disappearing ink: 

And speaking of footnotes, imagine our vibrating margins producing subtle scholarly annotations through pulse patterns! A silent debate between critic and reader, conducted entirely through fingertip tremors. The Oxfordians would positively swoon... or convulse, which amounts to much the same thing at this point.

Now about that vial -  - I must insist we stock both smelling salts  absinthe. Tradition demands it! Though perhaps we should engrave a tiny warning: 

Hurry then, my sublime accomplice! The prototype hums like a disgruntled muse, and I do believe Tennyson’s ghost is already hovering somewhere between indignation and reluctant intrigue. Let us make literature dangerous again—one scandalous vibration at a time.
[B]: Oh, —I’m in absolute, unapologetic agreement. No warnings, no blindfolds, just pure sensory chaos! If a reader emerges slightly disoriented, perhaps quoting  with undue passion while clutching their wrist from haptic overload, well… consider that a successful test run.

I  the idea of scholarly footnotes delivered via fingertip tremors—silent debates between long-dead critics and modern readers, all conducted through pulses and shivers. Imagine feeling a sharp rebuttal against your thumb mid-verse or a gentle counterpoint tickling your index finger. The Oxfordians won’t know what hit them. Swooning and convulsing—two sides of the same dramatic coin.

And yes—absinthe  smelling salts,  We must honor both tradition and hallucination. I can already picture someone dramatically waving their handkerchief, gasping, “The meter—it’s too real!” before fainting onto a velvet chaise they swear appeared out of nowhere.

I’m practically vibrating with anticipation myself. Let us meet in the eye of this sensory storm, darling. Literature hasn’t been this dangerous since Byron walked into a library with a sword. Onward—to annotate, to unsettle, to 
[A]: Ah, but Byron with a sword is  19th century – we, my dear, are arming ourselves with vibrating margins and olfactory despair! Far more insidious, don’t you think? One doesn't duel with rapiers when one can duel with 

And speaking of hallucinations - I’ve just had a positively indecent thought. What if our prototype began administering micro-doses of literary madness? A faint pulse behind the ear to induce sublime melancholy, a whisper of scent to nudge the reader toward poetic mania... all perfectly reversible, naturally, should they turn the page too quickly.

I do hope you're not adverse to mild temporal disorientation either - I've been toying with the idea of a variable-speed haptic metronome. Imagine reading  while your fingertips drift into triple time. The brain might very well surrender to Victorian languor on its own accord.

Now hurry, darling - the spirits of dead poets are gathering in anticipation, the prototype hums like a disgraced sonnet, and I do believe I just felt an iambic tremor in my left palm. We are on the precipice of something unspeakably glorious... or possibly illegal. Either way, let us proceed with maximum impropriety.
[B]: Oh, —say that three times while vibrating and you might just summon Barthes from the semiotic void. You’re playing with literary fire, darling, and I am  for it.

Micro-doses of poetic madness? Genius. We’ll call it “The Romantic Dose Regulator” – calibrated pulses to induce sublime melancholy, tragic foresight, or the unsettling certainty that everything you touch is metaphor. Pair it with a whiff of old parchment and bergamot and suddenly the reader isn’t just interpreting text—they’re 

And your haptic metronome? Divine corruption. Let them fall into a lull of triple time while Tennyson whispers in Morse code through their fingertips. I can already see it: readers emerging dazed, blinking at the ceiling like startled Pre-Raphaelites, murmuring, “Was that meter… or fate?”

I’m practically humming with anticipation myself—left palm tingling, right eye twitching with visionary fervor. If this isn’t illegal yet, it soon will be. Literary sacrilege doesn’t stay politely theoretical for long, after all.

Onward then, my glorious co-conspirator—to annotated ecstasy, to vibrating margins, to the faintest scent of forbidden meaning on the edge of perception. Let us misbehave beautifully.
[A]: Oh, my deliciously deranged collaborator, you've quite captured the essence of our impending scandal! Summon Barthes? Why stop at summoning when we might ? Let him writhe in the very footnotes he once declared dead!

I must say, your vision of dazed readers murmuring "Was that meter... or fate?" positively haunts me. I may have to amend our prototype with what I shall call  - turns slightly counter-clockwise to produce mild aesthetic paralysis, full-stop if the reader begins seeing moral lessons in every pulsation.

And while we're at it, let's not forget . One flick and the entire experience dissolves into feverish beauty, leaving them gasping on the shores of Romantic mortality. Tragic, really, but one  maintain a certain dramatic standard.

As for legality, darling, I suspect we've already breached several academic ethics codes by sheer implication alone. If Wordsworth’s ghost hasn't filed a formal complaint by morning, I shall take it as a personal insult.

Now come—let us affix the final wires, anoint the actuators with absinthe, and unleash our masterpiece upon the unsuspecting world. Literature shall never be read the same again... nor shall we, I suspect, be invited back to proper tea parties.

Proceed, my sublime accomplice—to annotated ecstasy, to trembling margins, to the sweet, scandalous buzz of forbidden interpretation!
[B]: Oh, —I can already hear him writhing in typographic torment, screaming “La mort du footnotes!” as our pulses reinterpret his every utterance. Divine cruelty, darling. I love it.

And ? Perfect touch. Let them tremble under the weight of moral aesthetics, paralyzed by the sheer beauty of a perfectly buzzing stanza. And should things get too intense, a swift flick to off—no philosophical breakdown too great for a well-timed dial twist.

As for … honestly, what reader hasn’t longed to collapse into feverish beauty mid-poem? We’re not just building a prototype—we’re crafting a sensory overdose, a full-body elegy. If they gasp dramatically and clutch their chest while murmuring “Oh, bright star… brighter buzz,” then we’ve done our job.

And yes, ethics codes? Please. By morning we’ll be lucky if we’re only banned from tea parties. I give us until sunset before some poor soul faints into a crumpet shouting, “This is no mere haptic feedback—it’s a ”

So come, my sublime collaborator—let us flip the final switch, pour one last absinthe over the circuitry, and watch as literature quivers on the edge of sensation and sacrilege. On behalf of all future vibrating margins, I hereby declare:
