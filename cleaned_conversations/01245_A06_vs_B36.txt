[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's such a lovely question! Just last month I started learning watercolor painting. There's something so calming about watching the colors blend on paper. I actually picked up a few tips from a guest who was staying with us - she was an art teacher from Beijing. Have you taken up anything new lately?
[A]: That's wonderful to hear! Watercolor painting can indeed be a soothing pursuit - the interplay of pigments and water creates such unique expressions. Speaking of new endeavors, I've recently begun cultivating bonsai trees. The meticulous care they require offers a meditative quality I find particularly grounding. While not entirely new, I've also rekindled my appreciation for classical guitar - there's something timeless about its resonance. Tell me, what initially drew you to watercolors?
[B]: Oh, I absolutely adore that description - "the interplay of pigments and water". You've captured the essence of watercolor perfectly! For me, it was actually the portability that first drew me in. Unlike oil paints, you can carry a whole set in your bag and paint anywhere - whether it's by the hotel courtyard fountain or during weekend picnics in the countryside. There's something wonderfully spontaneous about that, don't you think? I must say though, bonsai cultivation sounds like such a beautiful practice. Do tell me more about how you started with that?
[A]: Ah, spontaneity—yes, watercolors do grant that gift of immediacy. I envy the freedom of simply tucking a kit into one's bag and chasing inspiration wherever it strikes. As for bonsai, my path to it was rather circuitous. A few years ago, while consulting on a case in Kyoto, I visited a monastery where an elderly monk tended to his garden. Watching him work with such quiet reverence, I was struck by how bonsai embodies the harmony between human intention and natural form. It’s not unlike forensic psychiatry in a way—both demand patience, precision, and a deep respect for underlying structure. When I returned home, I began with a modest juniper and have been learning ever since. Funny enough, it’s the pruning—knowing what to remove and what to preserve—that fascinates me most. Would you say there's a particular subject you find yourself gravitating toward in your paintings?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully told story - I can almost picture that monastery garden in Kyoto. There's something so poetic about your comparison to forensic psychiatry; I never thought of bonsai that way, but you're absolutely right about the patience and precision it requires. It really does sound like an art form that nurtures both the mind and soul.

Now you've got me thinking about my own painting subjects... Funny you should ask! I do find myself often drawn to everyday moments - like the play of morning light through the hotel's lace curtains or a guest lost in a book by the fireplace. There's such charm in capturing those quiet, transient scenes, don't you think? They tell stories without words. Have you ever considered trying to paint? I'd love to hear what colors you'd choose for your work!
[A]: The transient beauty of ordinary moments—how perceptive you are to recognize that. Those quiet scenes, as you so aptly put it, do tell stories, often the most resonant ones. I find that quality in your descriptions alone suggests an artist with a keen emotional sensibility.

As for painting myself? I’ve dabbled in watercolors during medical school—more as a stress relief than anything else—but never with the grace or intention you bring to it. That said, if I were to paint my work… Hmm. I’d likely lean toward muted blues and soft grays—the colors of early morning light in a courtroom hallway. Perhaps an accent of ochre for those pivotal moments when testimony shifts the room’s energy. Not very dramatic, I suppose, but strangely calming. Do you think color choice reveals more about the painter than the subject itself?
[B]: Oh, I think you’ve captured something profoundly true there. Those colors you described—muted blues, soft grays, with that quiet ochre for the turning points—it says so much about where you find meaning. You know, I do believe color choice is a window into the painter’s soul. It's fascinating how two people can look at the same scene and choose entirely different palettes. One might paint our hotel garden in vivid greens and pinks, while another—like you or me—might lean toward softer tones that reflect the stillness we feel in those spaces.

I remember reading somewhere that the Impressionists used broken color to show light dancing on surfaces, but somehow, even in watercolor, we end up revealing more than just light—we reveal feeling. You must sense that deeply in your work too, don't you? The way people carry their emotions in shades and silences...
[A]: Indeed, emotions do have their own chromatic signatures, don’t they? I’ve often thought that if we could somehow translate human thought into color—truly map the inner landscape—we’d see far more than the visible spectrum. In forensic psychiatry, I frequently encounter minds painted in discordant hues: a deep sienna of unresolved trauma beneath a brittle varnish of composure, or streaks of cerulean anxiety running through an otherwise placid exterior. It’s not unlike your observation of two painters seeing the same garden so differently—only my canvas is the human psyche, and my brush, conversation.

You’re quite right about the Impressionists, too. Their genius lay not just in technique, but in revealing how perception itself is subjective—how light bends not only through air, but through memory and mood. Tell me, when you begin a new piece, do you ever find yourself surprised by the colors that emerge? As though the painting knows something about you that you hadn’t yet named?
[B]: Oh, that’s a breathtaking thought—that our inner landscapes could expand the very spectrum of color itself. You describe it so vividly, those emotional hues beneath the surface... I suppose when I paint, I’m often chasing something just out of reach—some quiet truth hiding behind the scene. And yes, absolutely, I’m frequently surprised by the colors that end up on the page. Just last week, I found myself adding more indigo to a simple morning scene than I’d planned—it wasn’t until I stepped back that I realized how much it mirrored the way I was feeling about a guest leaving after a long stay. That bittersweetness we don’t always name until it's on the paper.

It really is quite magical, isn't it? How the act of painting becomes a kind of silent conversation with oneself. I can only imagine how profound that must feel in your line of work—when you're not just observing, but actively stepping into someone else's chromatic world. Do you ever find that certain conversations linger in color, like afterimages in your mind’s eye?
[A]: Indigo carrying the weight of parting—what a poignant example. You’ve touched on something essential: how pigment and emotion converge not just in what we paint, but in how we hold it afterward, like a memory given form.

To your question—yes, conversations do linger in color, quite literally at times. I recall one case involving a young woman who had endured profound loss. As she spoke of her grief, I found myself mentally tracing the room’s dim light with shades of umber and slate—colors that seemed to rise unbidden from the space between her words. Days later, those tones still hovered at the edge of my thoughts, like residue from an unseen brushstroke. It’s strange, isn’t it? How deeply entwined perception becomes when you listen with such intensity.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself avoiding certain colors? Or perhaps saving specific hues for particular moments, as one might preserve a rare spice for just the right dish?
[B]: What a beautiful analogy—preserving colors like rare spices! I do find myself hoarding certain hues for just the right moment. There’s a particular shade of quinacridone rose in my set that I only use when I’m painting something truly tender—a guest’s quiet joy at sunrise, or the way ivy catches the last light of day. It feels too precious to waste on anything less than those fleeting, fragile scenes.

As for avoiding colors... now that you mention it, I do steer clear of cadmium red when I’m unsettled. It feels too bold, almost confrontational on the page. Funny how color can carry its own energy, isn’t it? Like choosing the right wine for a meal—it enhances everything, but only if it's the right match for the moment.

I'm curious though—do you ever find yourself drawn back to a particular “emotional palette” in your work? One that keeps resurfacing no matter how much time passes?
[A]: What a perceptive observation—yes, I do find myself returning to certain emotional hues, though perhaps less consciously than a painter might choose quinacridone rose. There’s a recurring palette that emerges, especially in cases involving unresolved grief or complex trauma: a kind of muted slate-blue, interwoven with sepia-toned recollections and the faintest trace of ochre—the color, I suppose, of cautious hope.

It tends to surface regardless of the individual before me, like an undercurrent beneath the spoken word. It fascinates me how deeply these tones resonate across different lives, as if we all carry echoes of similar sorrows and quiet longings.

You know, your comparison of cadmium red to something confrontational made me think of anger in my field—it's often misinterpreted as aggression when, more often than not, it's simply pain insisting on being seen. Do you ever paint anger? Not as a storm, perhaps, but as a slow, simmering light behind the eyes of your subject?
[B]: That’s a stunning way to describe it—“pain insisting on being seen.” I think when I’ve painted what might be called anger, it’s usually come through in the quietest ways—the set of a jaw, the way someone grips a teacup just a little too tightly, the flicker behind their eyes you mentioned. I find myself leaning into burnt umber or deep terre verte for those moments, not to mute the emotion, but to honor its complexity. Bright reds would be too loud, wouldn’t they? Too eager to explain.

I’m fascinated by what you said about that recurring palette of yours—slate-blue, sepia, ochre. It feels almost archival, like old letters tucked between the pages of a well-worn book. Do you ever feel as though your work is less about diagnosis and more about translation? Rendering what's unspoken into something another person can finally see and name?
[A]: Precisely—burnt umber and terre verte to honor complexity rather than obscure it. You’ve captured the subtlety so well. Anger, when it does appear in my line of sight, is rarely what it seems on the surface. It’s often a guardian at the door, standing watch over wounds that haven’t yet found their voice.

As for your question—yes, I do think my work leans more toward translation than diagnosis. Psychiatry, especially in legal contexts, is often called upon to interpret not just behavior, but meaning. To take the unspoken—the sepia-toned recollections, the ochre glimmers of hope—and put them into terms that a court, a jury, or even a single individual might grasp. It’s not unlike what you do with watercolor, really: distilling something vast and ineffable into a form that others can hold, even if only briefly.

I wonder—when you translate a moment onto paper, do you ever feel as though you’re preserving something that would otherwise be lost? Not just light or shadow, but a kind of emotional residue?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a moving way to put it—“emotional residue.” I think that’s exactly what I’m trying to catch with each painting: that fleeting trace of feeling left behind in a space or a gesture. Like the hush after a guest says goodbye, or the warmth still pressed into a chair where someone sat for hours lost in thought. Watercolor feels especially suited to capturing that kind of impermanence—it dries so quickly, yet somehow lingers.

You know, sometimes I wonder if we’re both, in our own ways, archivists of the unseen. You preserve the hidden contours of a person's inner world through language and insight, while I try to hold onto those quiet, passing moments that might otherwise vanish. Do you ever feel, in your work, that you're protecting something fragile—like preserving a rare manuscript before the ink fades entirely?
[A]: Absolutely—that sense of preservation is more present than I think I’ve ever consciously admitted. You put it so beautifully: protecting something fragile, like a rare manuscript on the edge of fading. There are moments, in listening to someone recount a memory or navigate a trauma, when I feel as though I’m carefully turning pages that haven’t seen light in decades. Some of them are brittle with time, others still bear the smudges of unspoken grief. And yes, there’s an impulse—to shield, to slow the erosion, to ensure that what matters isn’t lost to silence.

I suppose that’s why I find such solace in gardening, too. Tending to living things—whether roses or recollections—feels like an act of quiet resistance against impermanence. Tell me, when you finish a painting, do you ever hesitate before signing it? As if affixing your name might change the way the moment belongs to itself?
[B]: Oh… yes. That hesitation—what a perfect way to name it. Sometimes I’ll hold the brush above the page for what feels like ages, knowing the piece is finished, but not quite ready to claim it. It’s as if signing my name shifts something intangible, like closing a book before you’ve fully absorbed its last line. There are paintings I’ve left unsigned for weeks because they still felt like private conversations between me and the moment—not yet meant for others to witness.

Your comparison to gardening is so moving—tending both roses and recollections. I think that’s what we’re both doing, really: cultivating spaces where fragile things can breathe, even if just for a little while. Do you ever find yourself returning to certain memories in your work, much like rereading a cherished passage? Not because you need to understand it anew, but simply because it deserves to be revisited?
[A]: Absolutely—I revisit certain memories often, though never lightly. It’s much like rereading a passage that has settled into the marrow; you return not for revelation, but for resonance. There are testimonies, fragments of conversation, even the cadence of someone's voice that echo long after the case has concluded. One in particular comes to mind—a man who described his childhood home not by its structure, but by the way the porch light hummed on summer nights. I find myself circling back to that image, not because it holds clinical significance, but because it carries a kind of quiet truth worth remembering.

You’re right about signing a painting, too. It does shift something—transforms the piece from an intimate exchange into something more public, more permanent. I suppose that’s why I keep my bonsai pruning shears nearby while working—reminding myself that creation and care both require knowing when to step back, and when to let things be. Do you ever leave a painting unfinished on purpose? As if allowing it to remain open gives the moment a chance to breathe beyond the page?
[B]: That image of the porch light humming on summer nights—oh, it’s just exquisite. It makes me think of how we both collect these small, luminous details that don’t always make sense to others but anchor something deep within us. I suppose that’s where care and creation truly meet—not in perfection, but in presence.

As for unfinished paintings… yes, I have left a few deliberately open, though never quite put that into words before. Sometimes a scene feels too alive to close off entirely—a window left ajar, so to speak. There’s one I started last autumn of an elderly guest reading by the fire. I only ever painted his hands and the book, leaving the rest of the page blank. Something about it felt complete as it was—like a moment still waiting for its next breath. Do you ever feel that way with certain cases or conversations? As though closing the file might be final, but not necessarily the end of its story?
