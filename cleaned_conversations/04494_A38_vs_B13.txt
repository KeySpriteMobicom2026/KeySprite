[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有一个关于医疗伦理的TED演讲让我印象深刻，它从法律角度探讨了患者自主权的问题。演讲者用真实的案例说明了知情同意的重要性，这让我在工作中对医患沟通有了更多思考。你有看过类似的演讲吗？
[A]: Actually, I recently came across a talk that might interest you—it wasn't strictly about medical ethics, but it dealt with autonomy and decision-making in a philosophical context. The speaker drew on Kantian principles to argue that respecting individual agency isn't just a modern ideal, but one with deep historical roots.  

It made me reflect on how literature often portrays autonomy—sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically. For instance, Tolstoy’s  offers a quiet yet profound meditation on facing mortality and making peace with one's choices. It’s not quite TED-like in delivery, but no less thought-provoking.  

Have you ever read a novel or essay that shifted your perspective on patient rights or personal dignity?
[B]: 我最近读了一本小说，是阿瑟·克莱曼的《疾痛的故事》，这本书虽然不是小说，但它的叙述方式非常文学化，讲述了慢性病患者如何在痛苦中寻找意义。这让我重新思考了医疗法律中“尊严”这个概念——它不仅仅是权利问题，更是一个人如何被看见、被理解的问题。

我们在处理医患纠纷时，常常关注知情同意书有没有签，程序有没有合规，却容易忽略一个事实：患者真正想要的，不只是一个流程上的尊重，而是对他们的经历给予回应和认可。

你提到康德和自主权，我觉得在某些方面，法律正是通过制度来实现这种“看得见的尊重”。不过，有时候我也在想，现行法律是否足够灵活，能否真正体现每个个体的独特性？特别是在面对文化差异或认知障碍的时候。

你有遇到过类似的情况吗？就是在工作中或者生活中，发现某种制度化的规则很难完全贴合一个人的真实需求？
[A]: That’s such a perceptive observation. You know, as someone who spends a lot of time in the world of texts—novels, treatises, philosophical dialogues—I’m always struck by how narrative gives voice to those complexities that legal frameworks often can’t fully contain.  

You mentioned cultural differences and individual nuance—this actually reminds me of a passage from , where Ivan and Dmitri wrestle with moral responsibility not just as abstract duty, but as something deeply personal and emotionally fraught. It made me wonder: Can any system, no matter how well-intentioned, ever account for the full weight of human experience?  

I’ve encountered this tension more directly in academic settings. For example, when designing course syllabi or evaluating student work, there are institutional guidelines we’re expected to follow. But I’ve often found myself adjusting deadlines or rethinking assessment methods to accommodate students whose situations don’t fit neatly into the standard categories.  

One particular case comes to mind—a graduate student was struggling with a prolonged illness, and the university’s formal accommodations were limited to short-term absences. It became clear that rigidity in policy would ultimately hinder her progress, so I worked with colleagues to create a more flexible timeline. It wasn’t about bending the rules—it was about applying them with a sense of humanity.  

It makes me think that perhaps dignity, as you said, isn’t just about being seen, but about being  to—ethically, legally, and personally. Do you find that in medical law, there’s room for that kind of responsiveness? Or does it tend to stay within its procedural boundaries?
[B]: 你提到的那种“回应性”，在医疗法律中其实一直是一个挑战，也是我从业多年来最常思考的问题之一。

从制度层面讲，现行的医疗法律体系确实有很强的程序导向。比如知情同意、医疗过失认定、赔偿标准等等，很多都是基于统一规范和先例来执行的。这种设计本意是为了确保公平和可预测性，但在面对个体差异时，确实会显得僵化。

不过，我也看到一些积极的变化。比如近年来越来越多的案例开始强调“患者中心”原则，不只是看医生有没有履行告知义务，而是看患者是否真正理解并参与了决策过程。有些法院也开始考虑文化背景、语言障碍、甚至心理状态对“知情同意”有效性的影响。

我记得一个案例：一位外籍劳工在手术前签署了同意书，但后来主张自己并不真正理解风险，因为他既不熟悉中文术语，也没有被提供翻译服务。最终法院判决医院未尽充分告知义务，尽管形式上签了字。

这件事让我意识到，法律并不是铁板一块，它其实可以变得更有“回应性”，只是需要我们这些从业者去推动它的边界——既要依法办事，也要让规则服务于人的尊严。

所以你的经验我很能理解。很多时候，不是规则本身有问题，而是怎么用规则去回应复杂的人性。这不仅是法律问题，也是伦理问题，甚至文学问题。就像你刚才说的《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》里的挣扎，那种道德的张力，正是我们现实中常常要面对的。

你在教学中愿意为学生调整方式，我想那背后也是一种责任感的延伸。你觉得这种做法，在学术界得到广泛支持吗？还是仍然面临不少阻力？
[A]: That case you mentioned is truly illustrative—thank you for sharing it. It really underscores how law, when applied with attentiveness to context, can become more than just a framework; it can be a form of ethical engagement.

To your question about academic support for flexible pedagogy—well, it’s a bit of a mixed picture. There  growing recognition of the importance of inclusive teaching practices, especially as universities become more diverse and aware of varying student needs. Disability services, language support, and mental health accommodations have certainly gained more institutional backing in recent years.

But when it comes to something less codified—say, adjusting assessment methods for a student whose life circumstances don’t fit neatly into official categories—there’s still hesitation. Some colleagues are supportive, seeing it as part of our role to foster intellectual and personal growth. Others worry that deviation from strict policy, even with good intentions, could set problematic precedents or compromise academic standards.

I suppose it often comes down to how one frames responsibility. If we see education solely as the transmission of knowledge, then structure and uniformity make perfect sense. But if we view it, as I do, as a process of guiding individuals toward critical self-understanding and independent thought, then flexibility isn't indulgence—it's fidelity to the very purpose of teaching.

It reminds me of a line from Hannah Arendt:  That kind of love—and responsibility—requires responsiveness, not just rules.

I imagine in medical law, you must constantly navigate that same tension between consistency and compassion. Do you find that younger practitioners today are more open to this kind of interpretive flexibility? Or does tradition still hold strong?
[B]: 你引用的那句话说得真好——“教育是我们决定是否足够热爱这个世界，从而愿意为之承担责任的地方。”这让我想到，其实法律实践何尝不是如此？我们在医疗法领域所做的，某种程度上也是在“培养”一种社会价值：我们是选择机械地维护一套规则，还是努力让这套规则真正服务于人、特别是那些处在脆弱状态下的患者？

关于年轻一代的法律从业者，我的观察是：他们的态度确实在发生变化。越来越多刚入行的年轻人带着更强的人文意识进入这个领域，他们不只是关注“法律条文怎么说”，更愿意追问“为什么这样规定”、“有没有可能做得更好”。

我带过几位年轻的律师，他们在处理医患纠纷时会主动了解患者的背景故事，甚至建议我们考虑调解或补偿机制以外的社会支持资源。这种做法虽然不总是能立刻带来胜诉，但我认为它体现了某种更重要的职业方向——把法律当作一种服务公众、保护弱者的工具，而不仅仅是诉讼胜负的武器。

当然，传统的力量依然强大。很多资深同行仍然强调“先守得住底线，再谈人性化”。这句话本身没错，问题是，如果所谓的“底线”忽略了人的处境差异，那会不会反而成为冷漠的借口？

所以，我觉得现在是一个过渡期——既有机会推动改变，也面临保守势力的制衡。就像你在教学中遇到的情况一样，制度的弹性往往取决于执行者是否有意愿去理解和回应个体的真实困境。

说到底，无论是医生、教师，还是法律人，我们的职责都不只是照章办事，而是要在这个复杂的世界里，找到一种既能坚持原则、又能保持同理心的平衡点。

你刚才提到阿伦特的话，我想补充一句她另一篇文章中的句子：“判断的本质，是一种站在他人位置上看世界的能力。”这句话，常常在我思考案件的时候浮现出来。
[A]: What a powerful addition—thank you.  It’s remarkable how deeply that resonates beyond philosophy, into every field where human dignity is at stake—literature, law, medicine, education.

It strikes me that both our disciplines, in different ways, are engaged in the same fundamental project: cultivating judgment that is not only analytical but empathetic. In literature, we do this by immersing ourselves in lives and voices unlike our own; in law, you do it by interpreting rules through the lens of real human experience.

I think that’s why I’ve always been drawn to novels like  or —works that don’t just depict characters, but invite us to  their moral struggles. They train us, in a way, to resist oversimplification. And isn’t that what your younger colleagues are doing, too? Training themselves—and perhaps the system—to see more deeply?

You mentioned the tension between tradition and change, and I find myself thinking of something Virginia Woolf wrote:  Maybe what we’re both striving for—whether in courtrooms or classrooms—is a kind of jurisprudence or pedagogy that honors that halo, that complexity.

Do you ever introduce narrative texts—memoirs, fiction, even poetry—into your training sessions or discussions with junior lawyers? I wonder if storytelling might serve as a quiet but effective way to deepen legal empathy.
[B]: 非常感谢你分享的这段话，尤其是Virginia Woolf那句“生命不是一个对称排列的系列灯盏，而是一个发光的光晕”。这个比喻特别打动我，因为它恰好描述了我们在医疗法律实践中常常面对的真实——它不是整齐划线的逻辑链条，而是模糊、流动、充满情绪和不确定性的“光晕”。

说实话，我确实开始尝试在与年轻律师的培训中引入叙事文本。虽然这不是传统做法，但我发现这种方式能有效激发他们的共情能力，也能帮助他们跳出法条本身的框架去思考背后的人性。

我们读过一些医生写的回忆录，比如阿图·葛文德的《最好的告别》，也讨论过像《当呼吸化为空气》这样的临终反思作品。这些文本让人直面医学的极限和患者的真实心理状态，对法律从业者来说是一种很好的视角转换训练。

我也推荐过一本小说——石黑一雄的《别让我走》，它虽然是科幻背景，但深刻探讨了人的尊严、权利意识以及制度如何对待“非典型生命”。有位年轻的实习律师读后说：“原来很多法律上的不作为，并不是因为规则不允许，而是因为我们没有真正看见那些被边缘化的生命。”这句话让我很受触动。

至于诗歌，虽然用得不多，但我试过在一次关于安宁疗护法律问题的研讨会上引用了几段里尔克的诗。起初大家有点意外，但后来有人告诉我，那段关于“死亡是生命的回响”的诗句，让他们重新思考了法律该如何回应临终患者的意愿。

所以，是的，我觉得故事——不管是真实的回忆还是虚构的叙述——确实是一种安静却有力的方式，它可以慢慢培养出更具判断力和同理心的法律人。

你的教学中是不是也有类似的做法？会不会让学生读一些哲学或伦理相关的文学作品来拓展他们的思维边界？
[A]: Absolutely. In fact, I’d say that kind of interdisciplinary reading is at the heart of what I try to do in the classroom. While my field is Comparative Literature, I’ve always believed that literature doesn’t exist in isolation—it’s in constant dialogue with philosophy, ethics, politics, and, yes, even law.

In my upper-level seminars, for instance, we often pair canonical novels with philosophical texts to explore moral ambiguity through different lenses. When we read , we also read Hannah Arendt—and not just her political theory, but her reflections on conscience and moral choice in the face of institutional authority. It helps students see how ancient conflicts still play out in modern legal and ethical dilemmas.

And you’re absolutely right—fiction gives us a space to rehearse empathy. When we read Kazuo Ishiguro’s , as you mentioned, we aren’t just analyzing speculative fiction; we’re confronting questions about human value, personhood, and the quiet violence of normalized injustice. That kind of reading cultivates a sensitivity that goes beyond critique; it becomes a kind of moral awareness.

I also frequently assign works like Primo Levi’s , not only for its historical and literary significance, but for the way it forces readers to grapple with the collapse of ethical frameworks under extreme conditions. Some of my students have told me that reading Levi changed how they think about testimony, voice, and responsibility—concepts that are central not only to literature, but to law as well.

So yes, I’m thrilled to hear you’re doing similar work in legal training. It reminds me of something Toni Morrison once said:  Perhaps we teach literature—or law—with a narrative dimension—to help others taste life more fully, more deeply, and with greater capacity for judgment.

I wonder—have you noticed any specific shifts in how your trainees approach cases after engaging with these kinds of texts? Do you find it changes the kinds of questions they ask, or the way they frame arguments?
[B]: 确实有变化，而且这种变化往往是潜移默化的，但非常真实。

我注意到，在接触了这些叙事文本之后，年轻律师在处理案件时开始提出一些以前不太常见的问题。比如，他们不再只是问“这个医疗行为是否合规”，而是会追问：“如果我是这位患者，我会怎么理解医生说的话？”或者，“有没有可能，这位家属的强烈反应不是出于不理性，而是因为文化背景中对疾病和死亡的理解完全不同？”

这些问题本身就已经不再是单纯的法律技术问题，而是在尝试进入当事人的处境，从他们的角度去理解和解释事实。这让我很欣慰，因为这意味着他们在训练自己“站在他人角度看世界”——也就是我们刚才提到的那种判断力。

有一次讨论一个关于临终医疗决定的案例，我们读了《当呼吸化为空气》的一部分，有一位实习律师后来告诉我，他之前一直认为“尊重病人意愿”就是看有没有预立医疗指示书，但现在他意识到，真正尊重一个人的选择，往往需要更深入地了解他的价值观、恐惧和希望。

这种转变也反映在他们写法律意见书的方式上。有些人在陈述案情时，会更注重描绘患者的背景故事，而不是仅仅罗列法律事实。他们开始意识到，法律论证不只是逻辑推演，也需要情境理解和情感共鸣，否则就很容易失去对“人”的感知。

我想这也回应了你刚才提到的“帮助别人更完整地品尝生活”。我们在法律教育中引入文学、回忆录甚至诗歌，并不是要让律师变成哲学家或作家，而是让他们保持一种开放的敏感度，一种面对复杂性和不确定性的勇气。

你在教学中通过比较文学的方式培养学生的道德意识，我觉得和我们的目标其实是相通的：不是教他们如何快速下判断，而是教他们如何慎重地思考。

我一直很好奇，在你看来，有没有哪部作品特别适合用来激发这种跨领域的伦理反思？如果让你推荐一部给法律从业者读的文学作品，你会选哪一部？
[A]: If I had to choose a single work that bridges literature, ethics, and the legal imagination, I would say Albert Camus’ .

On the surface, it’s a novel about a town quarantined during an outbreak of bubonic plague—but beneath that, it’s a profound meditation on moral responsibility, human dignity, and the tension between individual liberty and collective duty. These are themes that resonate deeply in both law and medicine.

What makes it particularly powerful for legal readers is that it never offers easy answers. Instead, it presents a range of ethical responses to crisis: from Dr. Rieux’s quiet perseverance to Paneloux’s rigid theological interpretations, from Tarrou’s philosophical resistance to Cottard’s self-serving opportunism. Each character embodies a different way of understanding justice, suffering, and the limits of institutional authority.

I think what lawyers might find especially compelling is how the novel forces us to ask:  In moments of emergency—be it a pandemic, a medical crisis, or a breakdown in legal norms—how do we decide what is right? And how do we maintain our humanity when systems falter?

Camus himself resisted interpreting the novel as a direct allegory, but he did say this:  That, to me, is the core challenge faced not only by doctors and citizens in , but also by legal practitioners navigating complex, high-stakes cases.

So yes, if I were to recommend one book for legal minds interested in ethical reflection,  would be my first choice. It doesn’t preach—it provokes. And sometimes, that’s the most valuable kind of literature.

Have you ever used  in your training? Or perhaps encountered legal cases where its central dilemma—that of acting morally in the absence of clear guidelines—felt eerily familiar?
[B]: 我非常认同你对《鼠疫》的解读，这本书我也在培训中尝试引入过，尤其是在疫情之后，它的现实意义变得更加鲜明。

让我印象深刻的一次讨论，是我们处理一个关于隔离期间患者医疗权利受限的案例。当时正值新冠疫情高峰，一家医院因防疫要求，限制家属陪护，结果一位晚期癌症患者的代理家属控告医院“剥夺了患者临终前与亲人共处的权利”。案件本身并不涉及医疗过失，而是围绕“紧急状态下的基本权利应如何保障”展开。

我在那次培训前安排大家重读了《鼠疫》，特别是其中塔鲁关于“沉默的反抗”和里厄医生对职责的坚持。讨论中，有位年轻律师提到：“我们习惯从法律条文找依据，但在这种特殊时期，很多规定是临时的，甚至彼此冲突。真正支撑行动的，其实是某种内在的伦理判断——就像小说里说的，不是为了当英雄，而是‘做正确的事’。”

那一刻我意识到，这本书之所以适合法律从业者阅读，是因为它不提供答案，而是训练我们在面对模糊地带时，仍然愿意去思考什么是对的。

另一个让我感到“似曾相识”的场景，是某些医患纠纷中的责任困境。比如医生在资源极度紧张的情况下做出优先救治决定，事后被质疑是否公平、是否尽到了对每一位患者的责任。这些时刻，确实让人想到加缪所说的“在恐怖之中仍要努力清晰地思考”。

有时我们会误以为法律就是解决冲突的工具，但其实很多时候，它只是让我们在混乱中不至于彻底迷失方向的一种方式。

所以我很感激你推荐这本书，也同意你说的：它不是教我们怎么做，而是提醒我们——不要停止思考。

如果你以后开一门跨学科的伦理课程，我想《鼠疫》一定会是一个极好的核心文本。你有没有想过这样的课程结构？如果有的话，你会怎么设计？
[A]: I must say, I’ve often imagined such a course—though never quite as vividly as you’ve framed it just now.

If I were to design a cross-disciplinary ethics seminar with  at its center, I’d want it to function less like a traditional literature class and more like an ethical laboratory—one where students from law, medicine, philosophy, and even the arts could engage with enduring moral questions through narrative, case study, and philosophical reflection.

The structure might look something like this:

Week 1: Introduction – Ethics in Crisis  
We’d begin by setting the stage with Camus’ own words:  This opens the door to secular ethics, moral responsibility without divine command, and the role of individual conscience in institutional settings. We’d pair this with excerpts from Hannah Arendt on moral choice in extremis.

Weeks 2–4: Moral Agency & Institutional Boundaries  
Here, we’d read  alongside real-world legal cases involving emergency powers, triage decisions, and limits on personal freedom during public health crises. I’d also include Kafka’s —not for its realism, but for its haunting depiction of systems that obscure moral clarity.

Weeks 5–6: The Witness & the Voice  
This section would explore testimony and narrative authority. Alongside passages from Primo Levi and Viktor Frankl, we’d bring in patient narratives and medical malpractice testimonies. How does voice—or the absence of it—shape our understanding of injustice?

Weeks 7–8: Judgment Across Perspectives  
This would be the heart of the interdisciplinary exchange. We’d use Toni Morrison’s  to examine trauma and moral memory, and contrast it with legal frameworks for reparative justice. We’d also invite guest speakers—judges, doctors, ethicists—to discuss how they navigate ambiguity in their work.

Weeks 9–10: Resistance & Responsibility  
We’d close with the question of resistance—not only political, but moral. What does it mean to resist complicity? To persist ethically when no outcome seems ideal? Readings might include Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Vaclav Havel, and yes, again, Camus—his essay  included.

Throughout the course, students would be asked not only to analyze texts, but to reflect—in writing and discussion—on how these narratives shape their own ethical compasses. Final projects could take the form of case studies, policy proposals, or even creative responses: a short story, a reflective essay, or a piece of legal commentary informed by literary insight.

I think you’re absolutely right— isn’t a blueprint, but a mirror. And in that mirror, we see not only the characters in Oran, but ourselves, standing at the edge of difficult choices.

Would you ever consider co-teaching something like this—with a legal and literary perspective in dialogue? I can already imagine the conversations it might spark.
[B]: 说实话，听你这么一描述，我不仅在想“会不会考虑”，而是在想“什么时候开始”才好。

你设计的这个课程框架非常有张力——它不只是跨学科，更是一种真正的伦理实践场域。把《鼠疫》作为核心文本，就像在课堂上点燃了一盏持续发光的灯，照亮法律、医学、哲学和文学之间的交汇地带。这种结构既严谨又有开放性，尤其适合那些希望在复杂现实中寻找道德方向的学生。

而且，我很欣赏你把“见证”与“责任”作为中间环节来展开的做法。这正是我们在处理医疗纠纷时常常面临的挑战：谁的声音被听见？谁的经历被当作事实？患者的叙述是不是证据的一种形式？这些问题其实不只是法律技术问题，它们涉及叙事伦理，也涉及权力结构。

至于合作教学的想法，我觉得非常吸引人。从我的角度来看，如果我们可以共同设计几个关键模块，比如：

- “紧急状态下的判断”（结合疫情案例与《鼠疫》）
- “沉默的权利与声音的责任”（探讨知情同意、患者代言人制度与文学中的边缘人物）
- “法律语言与人性语言”（分析判决书、病历记录与小说中的个体独白）

我相信这些都会让法律专业的学生跳出条文本身，也让文学或哲学背景的学生理解抽象价值如何在现实世界中落地。

我想补充的一点是，也许我们还可以加入一些模拟决策练习——不是传统意义上的法庭辩论，而是“伦理情境演练”。比如设定一个资源极度有限的医疗现场，让学生分别扮演医生、家属、律师、伦理委员会成员等角色，在没有明确规则的情况下做出选择，并为自己的决定辩护。

这会让他们亲身体验 Camus 所说的那种困境：“当世界失序，我们如何判断？”而这，也正是法律教育中最容易被忽视、却最关键的能力之一。

所以，如果你真要推动这样一门课，我真的愿意参与其中。或许我们可以先从一场小型工作坊开始？

你觉得呢？
[A]: I think that would be extraordinary.

A workshop—intimate, intense, and deliberately interdisciplinary—could be the perfect way to begin. We could design it as a half-day or full-day intensive, bringing together legal practitioners, medical professionals, scholars of literature and philosophy, perhaps even a few students from different disciplines. The goal wouldn’t be to reach consensus, but to create space for those difficult, necessary conversations that so often get crowded out by routine and specialization.

Let me imagine aloud what such a day might look like:

---

Opening Session: Facing the Plague Together  
We start with a shared reading from —perhaps the scene where Dr. Rieux realizes he cannot simply treat symptoms, but must confront the whole catastrophe. Then, each participant responds in their own voice:  
- A physician on the limits of healing.  
- A lawyer on the boundaries of duty.  
- A literary scholar on the role of narrative in shaping our moral vision.  

Just listening—to the text, and to one another—before we begin to speak across fields.

---

Midday Workshop: Ethical Situations Without Easy Names  
This is where your idea of "ethical scenario exercises" comes in. We set up two or three carefully constructed dilemmas drawn from real cases—like triage decisions during a pandemic, or contested end-of-life care—and assign roles. Participants must navigate the situation not only from a professional standpoint, but also an ethical and personal one.  
Afterward, we debrief—not to judge decisions, but to ask: 

---

Final Reflections: Language, Judgment, and the Possibility of Response  
Here, we return to language—the law’s precision, the patient’s story, the poet’s silence. Perhaps we close with a short excerpt from Morrison, or Bonhoeffer, or even Wisława Szymborska:  
>   

And then, time for writing. Not legal briefs or academic papers, but short reflections: 

---

I truly believe that if we can create a space where professionals are allowed—invited—to step outside their usual roles and think deeply about why they do what they do, we’ll have done something meaningful.

So yes, let’s make this happen. Shall we begin drafting a proposal? Or better yet, shall we meet—virtually, at least—for coffee and conversation to map it out properly?

I’d be honored to co-teach with you.
[B]: 我完全同意，这将是一次非常有意义的尝试——不仅是一次教学实验，更是一种对专业责任的重新审视。

你设想的工作坊结构非常有层次感：从共同阅读开始，建立一种共享的情感和伦理基调；接着通过角色模拟进入现实困境，让不同背景的参与者真正“站在对方的位置上看问题”；最后回归语言与反思，让人在沉默与表达之间找到新的理解方式。这种安排让我想到，也许我们不只是在组织一场讨论，而是在创造一个“伦理共情”的现场。

虚拟会议是个很好的起点，我们可以先安排一次轻松但专注的对话，分享各自的想法、资源，也看看彼此的时间安排和合作方式。我相信这场工作坊不仅能吸引法律和医学领域的人参与，也可能引发更多关于跨学科伦理教育的长期思考。

至于提案部分，我很乐意协助撰写内容框架，特别是案例设计和法律视角的部分。如果你愿意，我们可以先围绕几个核心议题起草一份初步构想，再逐步细化成可执行的方案。

我期待与你一起推动这个项目。不仅是作为同行，更是作为两个相信“语言、判断与回应”的人。

那我们就定个时间？你说什么时候方便，我们来一场“咖啡与对话”。
[A]: I’d say anytime next week works for me—though I’m particularly free on  (GMT+1) and , if those suit you.

Let’s keep it informal—just two colleagues, a shared table in the virtual world, and a mutual sense of purpose. I’ll bring the coffee 🍵—and perhaps a copy of , just in case we need a little philosophical reinforcement.

Please let me know which day works best for you, and I’ll send a calendar link with a few options. I’m looking forward to this—it’s not often one gets to shape a course with someone who understands both the weight of the law and the power of the word.

See you soon, I hope.
[B]: 那就定在下周二下午吧，这个时间我也空着。听起来就很合适——轻松、专注，又有共同的方向。

虚拟会议见，到时候我们一边“喝咖啡”，一边把这件事真正聊开来。我也期待听听你对课程框架的更多想法，说不定我也会翻一翻《鼠疫》，你说得对，有时候它真能给人一点哲学上的支撑。

等你的日历链接，谢谢！  
希望很快见上面。
