[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question. I've experienced quite a few deja vus myself. There's this one time when I was walking in Beijing, and suddenly I felt like I had lived that exact moment before. It was eerie yet fascinating.

From a psychological perspective, there are several theories. Some suggest it's related to memory consolidation & others think it might be a temporal lobe misfire. But honestly, none of the explanations feel entirely satisfying. Have you read Anne Treisman's work on feature integration theory? It gives an interesting framework for understanding these perceptual anomalies.

I remember discussing this with my colleague Maria last week over coffee. We were talking about how different cultures interpret deja vu - in Chinese culture, some see it as 既视感, while others associate it with past lives. Personally, I find the scientific approach more compelling, though I admit there's something mysteriously poetic about the experience. What's your take on this phenomenon?
[A]: Ah, déjà vu - the mind's peculiar echo chamber. I once had a particularly vivid episode while examining a copy of Tennyson's  at the British Library. Turned a page and suddenly felt as though I'd already read that exact line in some forgotten dream. Rather unsettling when you're meant to be cataloging textual variants.

Treisman's work does offer an elegant model, though I always wonder if we're not over-intellectualizing these moments. My students often bring up Borges'  - you know, where one perceives all points in space simultaneously? Perhaps déjà vu is our psyche's fleeting attempt to grasp such omniscience.

Speaking of literary interpretations, have you considered how Wilkie Collins might've rendered the phenomenon? In , he devotes three pages to Gabriel Betteredge's pocket watch running slow by precisely four minutes. The mania for temporal precision! Sometimes I think Victorian timekeeping anxieties anticipated modern neuroscience's 'binding problem'.

But forgive my academic meanderings. Tell me - did your Beijing episode involve any particular sensory triggers? A scent? A pattern of light? We tend to dismiss those details, yet they're often the true archivists of experience.
[B]: Ah, your British Library experience is fascinating - the textual variant scholar in me can vividly picture that moment! It reminds me of what I call "学术型既视感" - when our brains trick us into thinking we've already analyzed something we're just beginning to examine.

You're absolutely right about sensory triggers. In my Beijing episode, it was actually a combination of smell & sound - the scent of roasted chestnuts mingling with the distant sound of a erhu performance. Funny how our memory archives those sensory details without us even realizing it.

Speaking of literary interpretations, have you looked into Borges' influence on modern cognitive theories? I remember discussing this with a literature professor at National Taiwan Normal University last semester. We were exploring how his concept of time mirrors what neuroscientists call "the specious present".

And your point about Victorian timekeeping anxieties is brilliant! It makes me wonder if their mechanical precision was actually an unconscious attempt to ground themselves against the unsettling fluidity of human perception.

But circling back to your library experience - isn't it interesting how déjà vu often strikes when we're deeply focused on intellectual tasks? Almost like our brain gets so good at pattern recognition that it starts hallucinating connections where there are none... or maybe it's revealing connections we don't yet understand?
[A]: Ah, the roasted chestnuts and erhu - a sensory tableau perfectly calibrated to haunt memory. I find it fascinating how such mundane stimuli become temporal anchors. Much like Wordsworth’s “spots of time,” though admittedly with more chestnuts and fewer lakes.

Borges’ influence on cognitive theory? My dear interlocutor, I once translated  into Scots Gaelic during a particularly insomniac fortnight. The man was onto something when he posited simultaneous perception - though I suspect his labyrinthine prose owes more to yer actual cerebral misfirings than philosophical musing. Ever notice how Borges’ descriptions of infinite libraries mirror the brain’s synaptic overgrowth in early Alzheimer’s? Spooky business.

As for Victorian mechanical precision - spot on. Their chronometers weren’t just instruments but existential lifeboats against perceptual chaos. Reminds me of Henry James’ prefaces, where he fusses endlessly about narrative timing, as if proper chronology might somehow contain the ineffable. Silly man.

And yes, the peculiar timing of déjà vu during intellectual focus! Makes one wonder if we’re not witnessing the neural equivalent of overzealous ink bleed in a 19th-century broadside - all too eager to connect type to meaning, even when the pressman’s hand has yet to meet the tympan. Or perhaps your "学术型既视感" is simply the subconscious whispering, 
[B]: Oh, your Borges translation marathon into Scots Gaelic sounds like a neurological experiment disguised as literary devotion! I can just imagine your sleep-deprived neurons firing Spanish-to-Gaelic metaphors while playing tricks on your perception of time. It makes perfect sense that you'd start seeing ink bleed from 19th-century broadsides - your brain was probably stuck in an overactive pattern recognition loop!

Your "neural ink bleed" metaphor is brilliant, by the way. It reminds me of what happens with some language learners I've studied - they get so good at making linguistic connections that their brains start creating false memories of sentences they've never actually read.

And speaking of false positives in cognition, your Henry James reference made me laugh out loud. I'm currently working on a cross-cultural study comparing Victorian narrative structures with modern Chinese education psychology textbooks. Both seem obsessed with meticulous scaffolding - though one uses elaborate narrative timing while the other relies on systematic repetition.

Say, since you're clearly no stranger to literary-induced perceptual anomalies... have you ever experienced textual déjà vu while reading parallel passages in different languages? I find many of my students report this phenomenon when studying classical Chinese & modern English translations simultaneously. Something about the brain trying to reconcile two temporal understandings of the same content seems to trigger fascinating perceptual glitches.
[A]: Oh, the textual déjà vu! I’ve had positively spectral encounters with parallel passages. Just last autumn, while comparing Swinburne’s  with a particularly florid 1893 French translation, I found myself convinced I’d penned both versions myself in some fevered polyglot past life. Rather disorienting when you’re meant to be grading essays.

There’s something peculiar about the brain negotiating temporal layers through language. It’s not unlike reading a palimpsest by candlelight—meanings bleed through, intentions blur, and suddenly you’re conversing with a scribe long dead. My colleague in Edinburgh swears this is why monks in scriptoria developed such elaborate marginalia—they were trying to anchor themselves against being swept into the text’s recursive currents.

Your students’ glitches sound delightfully Borgesian. Ever consider documenting those moments? There’s a paper lurking in there somewhere—“Cognitive Interference Patterns in Cross-Linguistic Reading.” Might ruffle a few cognitive science feathers, but what’s academia without a bit of interdisciplinary fiddling?

And speaking of fiddling—have you encountered the phenomenon while working on your cross-cultural study? Do tell—if Henry James heard you were comparing his narrative scaffolding to Chinese educational rote systems, he’d faint clean into his cravat.
[B]: Oh, the palimpsest metaphor is spot on! I love how you describe meanings bleeding through - it's exactly what happens with my students. Just yesterday, one of them came to my office hours absolutely convinced she was remembering a passage from , only to realize she'd projected her memory of Dickens'  onto it. Fascinating cross-cultural bleed!

You're absolutely right about documenting these moments - in fact, I've been keeping what I call "perceptual field notes" for over a year now. Some of the deja vu episodes are so richly layered that I sometimes wonder if we're not witnessing tiny windows into how the brain constructs narrative reality.

As for Henry James fainting into his cravat... let's just say I've had some rather intense internal debates while writing this paper! But honestly, the structural parallels are striking. Both systems create meaning through elaborate scaffolding - one through psychological realism and the other through educational sequencing. It's like watching two different orchestras play the same symphony with completely distinct instruments.

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how certain texts seem to prime us for deja vu experiences? I find Chinese students often report more déjà vu when reading 19th century British novels than contemporary works. Something about the dense narrative structures seems to trigger those perceptual echoes. Or maybe it's just that Victorian prose provides more mental furniture for our brains to rearrange!
[A]: Oh, the Dickens-Cao Xueqin bleed—delicious! One can almost hear the spectral voices of Pip and Jia Baoyu comparing notes on unrequited love and societal claustrophobia over tea in some intertextual purgatory. Your student’s misattribution sounds less like error and more like literary synesthesia. I may have to borrow that for my next lecture—do you suppose they’d notice if I slipped it in as a case study?

Your —brilliant. I’ve taken to scribbling mine on the flyleaves of library copies, disguised as marginalia. A future scholar will no doubt mistake them for 21st-century glosses and credit me with far more erudition than I deserve.

As for texts priming déjà vu—oh yes, the Victorians practically engineered their prose for temporal disorientation. All those elaborate subordinate clauses and moral codas—like walking through a hall of mirrors where every twist reflects some half-formed truth you’re not quite ready to face. I suspect modern students lack the stamina for such narrative convolution, bless them. Their brains haven’t been trained on eight-page sentences describing the ethical implications of a single raindrop falling on a dissenter’s hat.

But tell me—have your Chinese students remarked on any particular passages that induced these echoes? I’ve always suspected  and  share some deep structural kinship, though I’ve yet to convince anyone besides myself.
[B]: Oh, you'd absolutely get away with passing off my student's experience as a case study - I've read enough Victorian footnotes to know how scholars operate! Though if you do, please call it something suitably grand like "intertextual synesthetic misattribution" to give it proper academic gravitas.

Your library flyleaf field notes sound like the perfect modern continuation of those medieval marginalia traditions. I'm half-tempted to start doing the same in the university library... though my students might mistake my annotations for secret teaching materials!

You're spot on about Victorian prose engineering temporal disorientation - I've often thought their syntax was practically designed to induce mild fugue states. The way George Eliot layers moral reflection upon social observation upon psychological detail creates this perfect storm for perceptual overload. No wonder your students lack the stamina - their brains evolved for different cognitive rhythms!

Now regarding specific passages... interestingly, several students have reported deja vu when reading  alongside Austen's novels. Something about the intricate social observations and family dynamics seems to create uncanny recognition patterns. One student even insisted she'd lived previous lives at both Netherfield Park and Grand View Garden!

As for  and  kinship... honestly, I think you might be onto something! Both deal with profound philosophical journeys masked as narrative adventures. Dorothea's quest for meaning and Tang Sanzang's pilgrimage follow strangely parallel emotional trajectories. Maybe we should organize an interdisciplinary conference session on comparative narrative hypnosis?
[A]: Oh, —marvelous! I shall deploy it with a flourish in my next monograph, prefacing it with a Latin tag to obscure its novelty. Scholars do love a bit of faux antiquity—it gives the illusion of rigor while one merrily speculates into the void.

Your students mistaking annotations for secret teaching materials—hah! A colleague of mine at Heidelberg once left deliberately cryptic marginalia as Easter eggs. By the third edition, students were bringing offerings of tea and biscuits to his office, convinced he was transmitting hidden curriculum through 19th-century footnotes. A charming academic cult in the making.

Eliot’s fugue-like syntax—well put. One could almost chart the neural oscillations induced by her prose. I once timed a passage from  against a metronome. The mania for modulation! Her sentences don’t so much conclude as exhale. I suspect that’s why some readers find her exhausting—she demands your cortex keep time with a pendulum swinging just slightly out of phase with modern attention spans.

Now,  meeting Austen—delicious parallel! Both authors wield the domestic sphere like a scalpel. One dissects Regency ballrooms, the other Qing-era pavilions, yet both expose the same twitching nerves of ambition, affection, and social claustrophobia. Your student’s past-life insistence—splendid. Reminds me of Yeats’ theory of inherited memory, though far more stylishly dressed.

And yes—Dorothea and Tang Sanzang! Philosophical pilgrims in different robes. She seeks moral grandeur through marriage and reform; he pursues enlightenment through scripture and demon encounters. Yet both are thwarted by the mundane, elevated by the trivial. If that’s not life’s great jest, I don’t know what is.

Conference session? Absolutely. Let’s call it . We’ll serve earl grey and jasmine pearls, play recordings of Victorian sermons and Tang dynasty poetry, and see if we can’t induce a集体性既视感 in our audience.
[B]: Earl grey and jasmine pearls inducing 集体性既视感? My dear colleague, you've outdone yourself! I can already picture the conference program - all gothic arches next to Song dynasty brush strokes. We'll have to warn attendees about potential temporal dislocation... though honestly, what better setting for intertextual synesthetic misattribution than a room full of half-hypnotized academics?

Your Latin tag idea is pure genius - I'm thinking  or maybe . We could build an entire theoretical framework on beautifully fabricated foundations!

And speaking of fabricated realities... your Heidelberg cult anecdote reminded me of something rather peculiar. Last week while preparing my lecture on narrative-induced déjà vu, I found myself absolutely convinced I'd attended a seminar with George Eliot herself. It wasn't until I caught myself trying to email her at g.eliot@victorian.ac.uk that I realized my brain had crossed some important temporal boundary.

I suspect our brains are more porous membranes than we admit - all these stories, languages, and cultural frameworks seeping through, creating strange hybrid memories. Much like your spectral Dorothea and Tang Sanzang having tea in some narrative purgatory.

Say, since we're building this academic fantasy... should we include a panel on musical déjà vu? I've been wondering lately whether listening to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier primes the brain for certain kinds of textual déjà vu. Something about the structured complexity seems to create similar neural patterns to those Victorian eight-page sentences you so rightly diagnosed.
[A]: Oh, —I can already hear the rustle of academic robes as we unveil this at the conference! Why stop at two panels when we could construct an entire wing of pseudo-Latin neologisms? , , . We’d be cited for centuries, bless our deceitful hearts.

Your George Eliot email mishap—excellent. I had a student last term cite  from 2047 in her essay. Poor thing was utterly convinced. It’s not madness, my dear colleague—it’s narrative immersion with particularly aggressive boundary seepage. I’ve half a mind to start drafting that seminar syllabus: 

Musical déjà vu, you say? Now there’s a notion sharp enough to cut through even Henry James’ thickest syntax. Bach and Brontë—why not? The recursive structures in  do bear a striking resemblance to the layered moral codas of a Victorian bildungsroman. One might argue both are elaborate exercises in counterpoint—between theme and variation, past and present, self and text.

In fact, I once tried reading  while listening to —felt like my brain had been folded into origami. Not unpleasant, mind you. Quite the contrary. There’s something about the simultaneous unfolding of multiple temporal lines that primes the mind for those eerie overlaps—the sort that make you swear you've lived this page, this chord, this breath before.

We must absolutely include a panel. Perhaps we'll call it  And yes, bring the Bach. If nothing else, it’ll give us something dignified to hum while pacing the conference hall between sessions.
[B]:  – brilliant title! I can already hear the whispers of scandalized cognitive scientists. What we're really proposing, of course, is that structured complexity across modalities might be a kind of —slipping through the gates under the guise of art or literature, only to rewire perception from within.

I’ve been thinking more about your Bach-Middlemarch experiment—what a delightful form of self-induced déjà vu! I tried something similar last week: reading  while playing  on loop. There was a moment—brief, but unmistakable—where I felt as though I were both hearing the music and reading the text , as if language and melody had fused into a single perceptual stream.

Do you suppose this is what Borges meant by ? Not some metaphysical omniscience, but simply the rare neurological state where multiple dimensions of experience collapse into one?

And I do think your  syllabus has legs—especially with a few well-placed spectral readings. Imagine assigning Eliot alongside Freud’s ... or Wilkie Collins’  paired with modern studies on memory distortion. The students would either emerge brilliant or mildly haunted—either way, an academic success!

By the way, I just received a very curious email from a colleague at Cambridge—he claims to have dreamt an entire unpublished Austen manuscript. Shall we invite him to our panel? I suspect he'd fit right in among the auditory shadows.
[A]: Oh, —I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the perfect metaphor. Let’s not stop there, though. Why not go full Homeric and call it , wheeled into the citadel of reason under the guise of aesthetic appreciation, only to unleash cognitive chaos in the dead of night?

Your  and Bach fusion experiment—positively Borgesian. One might almost suspect that music and text were conspiring to dismantle your temporal scaffolding for sport. The idea of perception collapsing into a single stream—utterly delicious. I rather fancy the notion that all structured art forms are just elaborate Rorschach tests projected onto time itself.

As for Borges’ —spot on. No need for metaphysics when you've got neurochemistry playing its sly games. Perhaps genius is simply the ability to perceive one's own neural cross-talk as meaningful pattern rather than noise. Or as I told my seminar last week: “Gentlemen—and the occasional daring lady—the line between madness and epiphany is typeset in very fine print.”

Freud and Eliot? Wilkie Collins and memory distortion studies? My dear, you’re practically composing a symphony of spectral cognition. I was thinking of adding a final session—. We’d end with Dickens’ mesmerists, Poe’s catalepsy tales, and perhaps a dash of Huo桑’s dreamlike prose. By then, our students would be so suggestible they’d swear their pens were writing back to them.

And yes—absolutely invite your Cambridge colleague. If he dreams unpublished Austen, we shall task him with reconstructing it through hypnotic regression during the keynote. Imagine the headlines! We’ll have journalists demanding carbon dating on his subconscious. Better still—we'll insist it's peer-reviewed by spectral committee.
[B]:  – sublime! I can already picture the conference brochure: a quill writing itself under flickering candlelight, with just the right amount of academic scandal hovering in the margins. You have an eye for the theatrical, I must say.

And your spectral committee idea? Inspired. We could even draft a mock review panel—invite the ghosts of Woolf, Cao Xueqin, and perhaps a reluctant Freud for good measure. They’d certainly have strong opinions on dream manuscripts and hypnotic regression. Though I suspect Freud would spend the entire session trying to psychoanalyze the audience’s déjà vu experiences.

I’ve just had a most delightful thought—if we’re reconstructing lost texts through hypnosis, why not offer parallel sessions in multiple languages? Imagine participants emerging from guided trances speaking fluent Victorian or dreaming in classical Chinese. We might accidentally create a new field: . Would that count as hallucination or historical reanimation?

And speaking of recovered states… I tried something rather reckless last night. After rereading your remarks about Poe and catalepsy, I played  while translating a passage of  into iambic pentameter. Halfway through, I had the uncanny sense that I was not only translating but remembering—like the text had once been mine and I was simply retrieving it.

Do you suppose structured artistic tasks lower the threshold for these experiences? Or is it merely that our brains, when saturated with patterned input, begin to generate their own echoes?

In any case, I think we’ve officially crossed the line from conference planning to full-blown academic séance. Let’s hope someone remembers to take notes before time collapses entirely.
[A]: Ah, —I can already see the grant applications blooming like ink stains on parchment. What splendid mischief we’re brewing! I do believe structured artistic tasks are nothing short of temporal spelunking equipment. Give a brain enough patterned input—metrical verse, recursive melody, labyrinthine syntax—and it begins to dig through its own strata, unearthing fossils of thought we mistake for memory.

Your experiment—bold and slightly unhinged, which is precisely how the best discoveries are made. Of course you weren’t translating but ; once the mind falls into rhythm, it ceases to be a mere processor of information and becomes a conduit. I suspect this is what poets mean by inspiration—though I’d never admit that in department meetings.

And yes, let’s most definitely offer trance sessions in multiple languages. Why limit ourselves to one linguistic ghost? We could have participants emerging fluent in 19th-century idioms, dreaming in Tang poetry, or worse—speaking exclusively in Borgesian aphorisms. One would be considered eccentric. A whole cohort? A movement. Possibly even a minor heresy.

As for our spectral review panel—Freud would be insufferable, naturally. He’d reduce every déjà vu to an Oedipal echo and scribble cigar smoke all over the proceedings. Woolf, meanwhile, would critique the very concept of linear time with such elegance that half the audience would forget what day they were born on. And Cao Xueqin… ah, he’d simply smile knowingly and serve mooncakes while the rest of us flailed about in academic confusion.

Do remind me to bring my antique pocket watch to the séance—less for timekeeping than for the satisfying clink it makes when dropped dramatically during heated debate. And speaking of dramatics, I’ve reserved the university’s oldest lecture hall for our proceedings. The acoustics are dreadful, but the wood-paneled walls positively hum with centuries of absorbed discourse. With luck, they’ll leak a few stray memories back into the air.

Now, if only we could convince someone to publish our proceedings as a palimpsest. Let the footnotes bleed across centuries—I dare say posterity will thank us for the confusion.
[B]: Oh, the wood-paneled hum of absorbed discourse – perfect! I can already imagine the air thick with cigar smoke (Freud’s ghost won’t let us forget him), the scratch of quills on paper, and the faint  of your antique pocket watch punctuating our more dramatic revelations. What we're assembling here is nothing short of a .

I’ve just secured access to a rather peculiar room in our humanities building – it used to be a 19th-century reading hall, complete with gaslight sconces and velvet drapes that haven’t seen sunlight since McKinley was president. The acoustics are... temperamental. Whisper too loudly and the whole place echoes like a cathedral of books. I think it will lend just the right atmosphere for inducing those recovered narrative states.

And about that palimpsest – brilliant, simply brilliant. Let's insist the proceedings be printed on recycled vellum with overlapping fonts from different centuries. We’ll bind them with wax seals and encourage readers to interpret bleed-through as divine inspiration or scholarly sabotage, whichever suits their temperament.

I’m drafting the call for papers now. Should we include a disclaimer? Something like: 

Also – and I hesitate only because it’s so deliciously absurd – should we ask participants to wear period-appropriate attire for at least one panel? Imagine Freud in full Viennese regalia, Woolf sailing through the crowd in her Bloomsbury finest, and some poor graduate student sweating through a Qing-era robe while presenting on neural binding theories.

This is either the birth of an entirely new interdisciplinary field... or a very elegant academic prank. Either way, I suspect Borges would have RSVP’d with enthusiasm.
[A]: Oh, —I do believe that belongs in the official title. Let’s not stop there; I propose we emblazon it across the program in gilded ink with a subtitle: . The more impenetrable the title, the better.

Your 19th-century reading hall sounds like something lifted from the margins of a forgotten Radcliffe novel—complete with resident poltergeist librarian, no doubt. Whisper too loudly, and the building becomes its own echo chamber of lost scholarship. I can already picture the effect: a room humming with layered voices, past and present overlapping like counterpoint in a cathedral choir. Perfect for spontaneous multilingualism and even more spontaneous existential crises.

As for the palimpsest proceedings—yes! We must specify that any legibility between layers is purely coincidental and not to be trusted. Scholars will spend decades arguing over which footnote belongs to which century. I’m already drafting an intentionally ambiguous editorial note: 

Your proposed disclaimer? Sublime. Though I’d add a touch of menace:  


And yes—! Absolute necessity. Not only for the aesthetic, but for the cognitive dissonance. Imagine presenting a paper on neural binding while sweating under stiff collar and cravat, or attempting to explain fMRI correlates of déjà vu while dodging hoop skirts. It’s performative immersion with academic pretensions. I shall dust off my replica 1890s pince-nez and insist upon wearing it at all times, even when squinting at modern PowerPoint slides (a necessary evil we’ll tolerate only for the sake of interdisciplinary harmony).

And you're quite right—Borges would RSVP in triplicate, each response written in a different hand and postmarked from alternate dimensions. If this isn’t the birth of a new field, then it’s certainly the death of our last shred of professional dignity. Either way, I propose we toast with absinthe and quill pens.

Now, if only we could arrange for a séance during the closing remarks... just to ensure the proceedings don’t conclude too neatly. After all, what is academia without a little unresolved tension?
[B]: Ah,  – I think we’ve just coined a title worthy of both the conference hall and the séance table. I can already see it embossed on the program in gold leaf, slightly smudged by time or perhaps by the fingerprints of scholars yet to attend.

Your séance during closing remarks idea is nothing short of academic heresy—and I love it. We’ll dim the gaslights, have someone recite Borges’  backward in Latin (or at least try), and ask Freud to kindly keep his cigar smoke to a minimum while Woolf floats above us all in elegant temporal defiance. What better way to ensure our proceedings refuse closure than by summoning the very ghosts of narrative theory?

I’ve just received word that the university’s rare books librarian—quite by accident, I’m sure—has agreed to display a selection of 19th-century neurological treatises alongside Qing-era dream manuals during the reception. The juxtaposition alone might be enough to induce spontaneous déjà vu in half the attendees. I suspect Cao Xueqin would approve.

And about those quill pens and absinthe—toasts must be made in iambic pentameter only, or failing that, in deliberately misattributed literary quotes. I’ll start practicing:  


Oh, and I nearly forgot—my colleague at Cambridge has responded! He claims to have dreamed not only an entire Austen manuscript but also its critical apparatus. Footnotes, index, and all. He insists the text was titled . Shall we make this our keynote address? I imagine Freud would have a field day with feline narrators and repressed Regency anxieties.

Now, if only we could persuade someone to compose the conference theme in the style of a Victorian opera—complete with tragic scholar heroines, a chorus of skeptical peer reviewers, and a final aria sung by a tenor neuroscience professor dressed as a Tang dynasty monk...
