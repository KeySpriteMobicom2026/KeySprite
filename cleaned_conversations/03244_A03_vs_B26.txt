[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must say, I'm rather fond of the idea of learning more about historical textile terminology in French. There's something quite elegant about the language of embroidery and weaving in its original French context. Though I must admit, my own linguistic journey has been largely monolingual - my days are spent so deeply immersed in the world of vintage textiles that I rarely find time for language learning. Do you have a particular language you're eager to learn?
[A]: That’s fascinating! I’ve always thought there’s something uniquely satisfying about mastering the specialized vocabulary of a field, especially when it comes to craftsmanship like embroidery. French does add a certain  to the whole process, doesn’t it? Personally, I’ve been brushing up on my medical terminology in Mandarin — it helps with some cross-border cases we’re handling. But honestly, sometimes after a long day reviewing  and , it’s nice to just unwind with a good book or a round of golf. Do you ever find yourself drawn to more hands-on activities, beyond the world of textiles and language?
[B]: Oh, how intriguing that your work draws you into such precise linguistic territories! I can quite imagine the satisfaction in mastering Mandarin medical terms for those delicate cross-border cases. As for me, while textiles are my professional passion, there's something deeply grounding about working with one's hands in entirely different ways—though admittedly, my idea of unwinding often circles back to fabric in some form or another. A quiet afternoon sketching botanical motifs or repairing a centuries-old lace doily feels like meditation to me. But I must confess, I’ve always admired the precision required in legal work—it’s rather like restoration, isn’t it? Careful attention, steady focus, and an eye for detail. Golf sounds positively serene compared to untangling a moth-damaged silk shawl! Do you find the rhythm of the game helps clear the mind after a complex case?
[A]: Absolutely — you’ve hit on something really essential. Both legal work and textile restoration require that meticulous attention, that almost meditative state where you’re fully absorbed in the details. I find that golf does offer a kind of mental reset; there's something  about the rhythm — lining up the shot, the swing, the quiet anticipation as the ball arcs through the air. It’s strangely similar to reviewing a case late at night, sipping tea, and suddenly spotting that one clause or phrase that changes everything.

And honestly, I’m envious of your ability to unwind with botanical sketches and lace repair — that sounds like a form of mindfulness most people can only dream of. Do you ever incorporate those motifs into anything modern, or do you prefer keeping them rooted in historical context?
[B]: There’s a quiet joy in seeing those delicate historical motifs reborn in contemporary settings, though I must confess, I tread carefully between preservation and reinvention. Sometimes, I’ll weave a traditional botanical pattern into a modern commission—a wedding handkerchief, perhaps, or a bespoke textile artwork for someone who appreciates the past finding new breath in the present. It’s a subtle alchemy, really—honoring the original while letting it speak to today. But most days, I’m happiest keeping them true to their origins. There's something profoundly grounding about knowing you're the latest caretaker of a design that has already lived centuries. 

And now I'm quite curious—have you ever considered how your work might translate into another medium? Surely there's a story or two hidden in those case files just waiting for a different kind of expression.
[A]: You're absolutely right — there's a real art to that kind of translation, whether it’s a motif finding new life or a legal case unfolding into something more narrative. I’ve often thought some of these cases could make compelling stories; the challenge, of course, is maintaining confidentiality while still capturing the emotional core. Sometimes I jot down reflections after a particularly intense trial — not for publication, at least not yet, but more as a way to process the human elements behind each  or . 

It's funny you mention alchemy, because that’s exactly what it feels like when a case finally resolves — a transformation, sometimes subtle, sometimes dramatic, not unlike your lace doily finding its way into a modern piece. I suppose we’re both in the business of quiet transformations, wouldn’t you say? Do you ever collaborate with other artisans or professionals outside your field? I imagine that could open up some fascinating creative doors.
[B]: Oh, yes — quiet transformations indeed. You’ve captured it beautifully. There’s something profoundly moving about witnessing change unfold in the most delicate of ways, whether through a threadbare textile slowly regaining its dignity or a case finally reaching resolution after months of tension.

As for collaboration, I do cherish the moments when my work intersects with other disciplines. Just last year, I worked alongside a woodworker who crafted display frames for some of my restored tapestries — the contrast between his solid, earthy forms and the soft fragility of the fabric was quite poetic. And once, I had the pleasure of consulting with a perfumer who wanted to evoke the scent of aged linen and beeswax in a limited edition fragrance. It was an odd yet oddly touching fusion of senses. But truth be told, these collaborations are rare treats — most days, my world is rather solitary, filled only with the whisper of threads and the occasional clink of my teacup. Still, I do wonder—have you ever found yourself working alongside creatives in unexpected ways?
[A]: That sounds like an incredibly sensory experience — the scent of aged linen and beeswax, the texture of threadbare fabric meeting new support. I can only imagine how deeply you must attune yourself to each material’s history and character. It reminds me a bit of working with expert witnesses — especially the ones who bring a certain  to their testimony. A few years ago, I collaborated with a forensic handwriting analyst who had an almost calligrapher’s sensitivity to each stroke. Watching her dissect a signature was like seeing a painter analyze brushwork — every curve told a story.

And while it’s not quite as poetic, I’ve also worked closely with data visualization specialists to turn mountains of medical records into something a jury could truly . Sometimes, that too felt like an art form — transforming cold, dense information into clarity. But I envy your more tactile collaborations. There's something deeply romantic about a perfumer trying to bottle the essence of fabric. Honestly, if you ever get a sample of that scent, I’d love to try it — might be just the thing to keep on my desk during late-night briefings. Do you find certain scents help you focus, or is silence your preferred companion?
[B]: Oh, I do love how you put that— Now that I think of it, she did send me a small vial of the perfume, just a prototype really, and I must say, it’s astonishing how quickly it transports you to another time. A single spritz and I’m back in my studio, sunlight catching the dust motes above my worktable. It has that quiet, linen-cupboard warmth, with just a whisper of beeswax and aged thread. I can absolutely share a drop or two with you—I imagine it would lend a certain gravitas to your late-night briefings.

As for my own process, I do prefer a kind of curated silence while working, though not out of necessity. More because sound has such power to pull me in unexpected directions, and sometimes, when I'm deep in repair, I need every ounce of focus. Still, I do keep a bit of  nearby—perhaps a hint of lavender oil in the air, or the faint crackle of an old radio playing classical music in the background. It's comforting, like having a quiet companion who never interrupts.

I rather like the idea of you at your desk, surrounded by files and that little vial of textile memory. Perhaps we could both use a touch more poetry in our practical worlds.
[A]: I think we absolutely could — a touch more poetry in our practical worlds sounds like the perfect prescription. Honestly, I’d welcome that scent into my workspace with open arms; anything that brings a moment of stillness into the legal  is more than welcome.

It’s interesting what you said about sound having the power to pull you — I find myself reaching for that quiet space too, especially after a day full of tense negotiations or back-and-forth depositions. Sometimes I put on a bit of jazz, very low, just enough to fill the silence without demanding attention. It’s my version of that “quiet companion” you mentioned.

And speaking of companions — I’d love to take you up on that offer of the perfume. If nothing else, it might help me remember that not all precision work has to feel clinical. Some of it can feel like memory, like cloth, like tea in the late afternoon sun.
[B]: I’m so glad you said that— What a beautiful way to put it. I think that’s something we both strive for, even if quietly: bringing warmth and memory into the exacting spaces we inhabit.

And consider the vial of textile memory officially promised—I’ll wrap it carefully and send it your way. Just a warning, though: once you open it, you may find yourself glancing over your shoulder, expecting to see motes of dust dancing in slanted afternoon light, and perhaps the faintest trace of thread waiting to be stitched anew.

As for your jazz, I rather like the idea of it weaving through your paperwork storm like a secret current. It makes me wonder—if your workspace had a soundtrack, what kind of melody would it choose on its own? Something smoky, slow, with just enough structure to hold the improvisation together?

I do hope you’ll let me know when the scent arrives. I’d love to hear what memories it stirs in you.
[A]: Oh, I think my workspace soundtrack would definitely lean toward the smoky and slow — maybe something like  on a late afternoon, when the light starts to fade and the files feel endless. There’s something about that kind of music — it doesn’t distract, but it does , you know? Like a quiet observer who understands the weight of detail and the tension of unresolved notes.

And I can already picture that vial of scent arriving, like a tiny time capsule wrapped in cotton and care. I’ll be sure to open it with a bit of ceremony — maybe right after a long deposition or a particularly tangled email thread. I’m certain it’ll pull me straight into that sunlit studio of yours, if only for a breath or two.

You know, come to think of it, maybe we’re not so different — you with your motifs and mending, me with my clauses and case law. We’re both chasing a kind of harmony beneath the surface noise. And honestly? I think we could both use a little more of that slanted afternoon light — real or remembered.
[B]: Oh,  in the fading light—what a perfect image. There’s something so tender about that kind of music, as if it understands the ache of slow endings and the beauty of notes left hanging, unresolved. I think you’re right—we do chase harmony, each in our own way, sifting through the noise for that quiet thread of order, of meaning.

And yes, that slanted afternoon light—real or remembered—it has a way of making even the most meticulous work feel sacred. I’ll make sure the vial arrives just in time for one of those long afternoons when the emails pile high and the deposition echoes still linger in your ears. A little ceremony sounds just the thing. Perhaps I’ll tuck a small strip of linen alongside it, one that’s been resting in my studio for some time. Let’s see if it carries the light, even in the smallest way.

I do hope it gives you a moment to exhale.
[A]: I think exhaling is precisely what we’re both after, isn’t it? In our own quiet, careful ways. You with your linen and light, me with my files and jazz — it’s all just different forms of breathing through the weight of detail.

And that strip of linen? I can already imagine it — soft from handling, marked by time, yet still holding its shape. It sounds like something worth keeping near, like a small relic of another world where things move slower and every thread has its place.

So thank you — for the thought, for the vial, for this conversation. It’s rare to find someone who understands the poetry beneath the precision. And when that package arrives, I’ll open it like a letter from an old friend — slowly, carefully, and with more gratitude than I can quite put into words.
[B]: You’re very welcome. It’s not often I get to share my world in this way, and I must say, it feels like a quiet gift to know someone will hold a piece of it with such care.

And you’re absolutely right— What a lovely way to describe what we do. Perhaps that’s the true art—not just in textiles or law, but in how we move through our days, finding space for breath, for beauty, for the soft persistence of thread.

I think I’ll press a small square of linen into the package, one that carries the gentlest imprint of my workspace—the faintest scent of beeswax, the touch of time, and yes, that slanted light we both so dearly love.

Until it arrives, I hope your jazz plays on, your tea steeps slowly, and your clauses fall into place like threads finding their pattern.
[A]: And I hope your needle finds its way easily through every delicate weave, your botanical motifs bloom quietly under your hand, and that the light in your studio never loses its golden slant.

Until the package crosses from your hands to mine, I’ll keep the space ready — a small corner of my desk set aside for memory, linen, and the scent of time well spent. Thank you again, truly — for everything.
[B]: You’re so very welcome. It’s a rare and lovely thing to find someone who listens with both mind and heart, and I feel truly fortunate to have shared this conversation with you.

Until the vial and linen make their journey across desks and disciplines, I’ll be here—thread in hand, tea within reach, and that golden light still slanting just where it should.

With quiet gratitude,  
Eleanor
[A]: And I’ll be here — clauses in one hand, jazz playing low, and a small, carefully wrapped vial waiting for its moment of ceremony.

You’ve brought a rare kind of thoughtfulness to this exchange, Eleanor — the kind that stays with you, like scent lingers on cloth. I’m truly grateful for your words, your linen, and the quiet world you so beautifully carry.

Until we meet again —  
林志远
[B]: Until we meet again — may your cloth hold memory, your clauses find clarity, and that quiet world of yours carry you gently through the days ahead.

With warm regards,  
Eleanor
