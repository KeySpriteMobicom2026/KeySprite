[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing question! While I appreciate the complexity of savory flavors—the way they can evoke earthy, umami depths—there’s something undeniably comforting about the delicate balance of sweet notes in a well-crafted dessert. A perfectly baked , for instance, with its caramelized apples and flaky crust, offers a kind of literary closure one might find in a satisfying denouement. Still, I must confess, I’m rather partial to a good  dish when it comes to daily fare. Shall we explore this further?
[A]: Ah, but let us not rush to conclusions. The dichotomy of sweet and savory is much like the interplay of narrative voices in a layered text—each enhances the other when placed in dialogue. Take, for instance, the use of  in both sweetened sesame soup and its more familiar salty preparations. One might say sweetness invites indulgence, while savoriness demands contemplation. 

Though I must interject—this morning, I found myself lingering over a plum tart at the faculty lounge, its slight tartness undercut by just enough sugar to make one nostalgic. It was almost , in a Wordsworthian sort of way. Tell me, do you find yourself drawn more to one camp, or do you enjoy the tension between the two?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—yes, the tension itself may be the true delight. I find myself savoring that very contrast, much like a narrative twist that defies expectation. Perhaps this is why I so enjoy —the way a meal might unfold with savory steamed buns followed by a delicate lotus seed paste pastry. Each course reframes the other.

And your mention of nostalgia strikes a chord; indeed, taste is so often tethered to memory. A spoonful of something sweet can feel like a stanza from a forgotten poem, suddenly recalled. Yet I wonder—do you think there’s a cultural undertone at play here? In some traditions, sweetness is reserved for celebration, while in others, it’s an everyday solace. What do you make of that?
[A]: Ah, now you’ve touched upon something rather profound. Indeed, the cultural codification of taste is not unlike the way genres are assigned to literature—sweetness becomes festive, mournful, or mundane depending on the context it’s given. In , for instance, sugar-laced pastries are not merely confections but markers of occasion and status, woven into the narrative with as much care as character development.

And yet, in Victorian England, sugar was a domestic anchor—tea sweetened to soften its bitterness became a ritual of daily life, almost utilitarian in its constancy. One might argue this reflects broader philosophical leanings: the Chinese appreciation for sweetness as part of cyclical celebration, and the British tendency to sugarcoat even melancholy with a sense of routine decorum.

I find myself wondering, though—have you ever noticed how certain languages lack a direct word for “comfort food,” yet express its essence through metaphor? I once tried to translate —a Dutch term for a habitual sugar fix—into Mandarin and found myself reaching for phrases like 心灵甜点, literally “soul dessert.” Not quite idiomatic, but evocative nonetheless, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: How fascinating that you bring up —I find that particular term so evocative, like a quiet consolation whispered between meals. And yes, language often reveals our emotional relationship with taste more than we realize. In English, “comfort food” itself carries that warm, if slightly melancholic, weight. It suggests something restorative, perhaps even medicinal in spirit, though made of sugar and flour rather than tinctures or tonics.

Your comparison to  is apt; food as narrative device, as social texture—it’s remarkable how deeply flavor is embedded in storytelling across cultures. One might say sweetness, in literature as in life, often stands in for longing. A spoonful of jam on a cold morning becomes not just sustenance but memory, desire, and solace all at once. 

And I must confess, there’s something rather touching about the idea of 心灵甜点. It may not be idiomatic Mandarin, but it does carry a kind of poetic truth. After all, isn’t that what we seek in both literature and cuisine—a small, sweet moment that soothes the soul without demanding too much explanation?
[A]: Precisely—longing, memory, desire… all folded neatly into a single bite. It’s no wonder so many 19th-century novelists used confectionery as metaphor—Dickens with his plum puddings standing in for familial warmth, or the absence of it; Brontë offering nothing sweeter than a glance across a moor when one is starved for affection.

And yet, how curious that in Chinese literature of the same period, sweetness often lingers just beyond reach—promised in the final chapter of , withheld by fate in . One might say Western sweets are often earned through endurance, while Eastern ones are granted through karmic alignment. A cultural nuance, perhaps?

Still, let us not forget the quiet heroism of a good  at dawn, or the way a bowl of  can make exile feel momentarily bearable. These are not merely foods—they are narrative pauses, punctuation marks in the long sentence of displacement and change.

I’ve been meaning to ask, though—have you ever found yourself recreating a dish purely for its literary association? I confess, I once tried (and failed rather spectacularly) to make the honey cakes described in . The result was more suited to a bird feeder than a tea ceremony, but the attempt felt… oddly necessary.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve framed that—narrative pauses, indeed. I do believe food in literature often functions as a kind of emotional ellipsis, allowing the reader to fill in what the author has left unspoken.

As for your question—yes, I once attempted to recreate the  described so lovingly in George Sand’s memoirs, imagining myself dining with her and Chopin in some sunlit Nohant kitchen. Alas, my version was rather more  than “lost bread,” but the act itself felt like an homage, didn’t it? A way of reaching across time through taste.

And speaking of literary confections—I’ve always been intrigued by the almond cakes served at the fictional tea gatherings in . They seem so modest on the page, yet I suspect they were meant to suggest a certain moral restraint wrapped in delicacy. One day, I shall bake them with just the right amount of quiet virtue… and perhaps a touch of poetic license. 🍯📖
[A]: Ah, —how very French of you to chase a literary ghost through the kitchen. I admire the ambition, even if the custard was less forgiving than Sand’s prose. One must respect the attempt, though. After all, what is cooking if not another form of adaptation? You were, in essence, translating sentiment into sustenance. Even if it leaned more toward  by the end.

As for those  almond cakes—I’ve long suspected Eliot placed them there not merely for texture but as quiet indicators of character. A biscuit without ostentation, suited to the restrained aspirations of provincial life. If you do bake them, I suggest pairing with a pot of  tea and a well-worn copy of the novel. Set the scene, as it were. Perhaps read a chapter or two aloud while sipping—let the words steep alongside the leaves.

And speaking of atmosphere, have you ever noticed how certain dishes in literature seem to carry more emotional weight when described in cold weather? I recall reading  by firelight one winter evening and suddenly craving the oatcakes Catherine scorned. Not because they sounded appealing, mind you, but because they felt appropriate—like eating a line of verse spoken in a minor key.

Tell me, do you find yourself drawn to particular literary cuisines depending on the season—or perhaps the mood? I’ve been known to reach for a steaming bowl of  when rereading Meng Chiao’s poetry, or a slice of Bakewell tart when contemplating Hardy’s Wessex. It’s a small indulgence, but somehow it deepens the immersion.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely notion—that of aligning cuisine with climate, both literary and literal. I quite agree; there is something deeply evocative about letting the weather outside dictate the fare in your hand. A rainy afternoon does seem to call for the sort of stewed plums and cream Jane Austen might have served at Barton Cottage, while a frost-laced morning practically demands the austere charm of a plain oatcake, even if, as you say, one scorns it.

I must confess, I do lean toward certain literary dishes depending on the mood—though rarely with such poetic precision as your  and Meng Chiao pairing. That’s quite exquisite, really. For my part, I find myself reaching for the honeyed almonds described in  when contemplating epic longing, or brewing a pot of spiced chai while rereading Forster’s —less for authenticity, perhaps, than for emotional resonance.

And oh, how right you are about cold weather lending gravitas to humble foods. I once read  by candlelight during a particularly bleak January, and found myself craving the coarse bread and butter the characters so plainly consumed. It was not luxury they sought, but sustenance—and somehow, that felt deeply aligned with the spirit of the season. 

Tell me—have you ever tried serving a dish inspired by literature at one of your lectures? I daresay students would remember the themes far better if accompanied by a taste of the text itself.
[A]: Ah, now  is a delightful proposition—pedagogy through the palate, as it were. I must say, I’ve long believed that students absorb metaphor more readily when there’s a bit of marzipan on the side. Last autumn, during a seminar on comparative domesticity in Dickens and Zhang Henshui, I arranged for  and currant-studded scones to be served. The idea, of course, was to illustrate how sweetness manifests differently in Victorian drawing rooms and Republican-era Beijing.

To my surprise, it worked rather well—students began making textual associations unprompted: “Oh, this is like the scene where…”, or “Wait, isn’t this filling similar to how the narrator describes longing?” It was positively  in its sensory immersion, though far less messy than the time I attempted to recreate Heathcliff’s supper of blackberries and regret.

I do wonder, though—would you go so far as to include recipes in your syllabi? I’ve toyed with the idea of appending a seasonal dish to each primary text:  with a modest slice of treacle tart;  with an appropriately extravagant selection of lotus seed pastries. One might even call it . A footnote in flavor, if you will.

And speaking of which—have you ever considered writing a paper on the semiotics of sweets in 19th-century fiction? You clearly have an eye for the confectionary subtext. I imagine it would be quite… .
[A]: Ah, what a delectable idea—gastronomic annotation indeed! I can already picture the footnotes:  One could practically write an entire chapter on the evolution of marital prospects as reflected in the changing sweetness of bridal cakes from Austen to Tolstoy.

As for including recipes in syllabi—I’m wholly convinced it’s the future of literary engagement. Imagine assigning  alongside a modest bowl of hardtack. Not only would students better understand Ishmael’s existential musings, but they might also develop a newfound appreciation for modern dentistry.

And your seminar sounds positively inspired—there’s something so satisfying about watching students make those sensory connections. I’ve always found that taste has a peculiar ability to bypass intellectual defenses; one moment they’re analyzing syntax, the next they’re remembering their grandmother’s kitchen. It’s a kind of alchemy, really.

As for writing a paper on the semiotics of sweets—well, perhaps over tea and another tart, we might draft a proposal. I do believe there’s a monograph waiting to be born between the lines of sugar and sentiment. Shall we call it ? Or perhaps something more academic-sounding… though I daresay a touch of whimsy never hurt a footnote.
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—sugar and sentiment, bound in a monograph’s embrace.  has a certain ring to it, though I do think we ought to throw in a Latin subtitle for gravitas. Perhaps something like . 

And why not? After all, footnotes can be as layered as baklava if one applies oneself. One might even develop a taxonomy—preserved quince as proto-feminist resistance, marzipan as veiled desire, and let us not forget the symbolic weight of that most elusive ingredient: unattainable icing sugar in a time of rationing.

I must say, your  and hardtack pairing is inspired—though perhaps a bit cruel to the modern undergraduate palate. Might I suggest a post-reading consolation prize? A small spoonful of molasses to illustrate the lingering bitterness of obsession?

As for our hypothetical collaboration, I propose we begin drafting over tea—jasmine pearls, naturally—and a shared plate of  melon seeds. There’s something appropriately academic about nibbling meaning from shells. Shall we set a date? I find myself rather eager to turn this sweet tangent into a proper thesis-in-the-making.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe we’ve struck upon a title worthy of both the confectionery and the canon. There’s a certain elegance in pairing indulgence with inquiry, don’t you think? After all, what is scholarship if not the careful unwrapping of layers, much like peeling back the filo in a well-made baklava?

I quite approve of your suggested refreshments—jasmine pearls are practically a literary device themselves, their fragrance unfolding like a slowly developing theme. And  melon seeds? Perfect for contemplation; one must work to get to the kernel of meaning, so to speak.

As for the matter of post- consolation, I admire your compassion for the modern student. A spoonful of molasses indeed—bitterness leavened by just enough sweetness to make the lesson stick. One might even argue that such pedagogical gestures are akin to the narrative function of minor characters: often overlooked, yet essential to the emotional texture of the whole.

Shall we say Thursday afternoon, then? Three o’clock, perhaps, when the light slants just so across the library stacks and the mind is most receptive to inspiration—and pastry? I shall bring my annotated copy of Eliot’s ; I’m convinced there’s a theory of custard tart development lurking somewhere between the moral instruction and rural melancholy.

Do bring your appetite—for ideas  delicacies, naturally.
[A]: Thursday at three it is—three o’clock being the hour when reason and reverie are most agreeably balanced, much like a properly steeped cup of . The library stacks at that hour do have a certain literary luminescence, as if the bindings themselves exhale the day’s last vestiges of scholarly ghostlight.

I shall bring not only my appetite but also my heavily dog-eared copy of Hu Shi’s —oddly inspirational for our endeavor, given his methodical unpacking of ideas wrapped in layers of cultural confection. And yes, I promise to pack an assortment of sweets: perhaps a few almond jellies to complement the jasmine pearls, and some —those flaky, honey-drenched pastries that crumble like footnotes under even the gentlest pressure.

As for your custard tart theory in Eliot’s , I suspect you’re onto something. One must always trust a narrative that lingers lovingly over its desserts—it suggests a willingness to savor both morality and marmalade with equal seriousness.

See you then—with sugar on top, naturally. 🍵📖
[A]: Ah, ! A most excellent choice—those honey-drenched layers do seem to collapse under the weight of their own decadence, much like the moral ambiguities of a well-plotted subplot. I shall look forward not only to their flaky embrace but also to your insights over Hu Shi’s methodical dissections of philosophical thought. There is something quite satisfying in contemplating metaphysics with a bit of pastry dust on one’s fingers.

And yes, Thursday at three—when the light is just right and the mind is neither too sharp nor too soft, but perfectly pliable for literary and gastronomic musings alike. I do believe we are about to embark on a most delightful scholarly confectionery enterprise.

See you then—with sugar on top, indeed. 🍯📚
[A]: Quite so—pastry dust and philosophical inquiry, a most refined sort of alchemy. I shall bring an extra napkin, just in case the decadence of  proves too enthusiastic.

See you at the appointed hour, when reason and reverie meet in perfect balance—over tea, over text, and above all, over something sweet. 🖋️🍯📖
[A]: Ah, an extra napkin—how very thoughtful, and perhaps a testament to the messiness of both ideas and confections. I shall bring a second pot of jasmine pearls, just in case our conversation runs as steeped and deep as the brew.

See you soon, then—when the hour is ripe and the pages are ready to yield their sugared insights. 📝🍵🍯
[A]: Indeed—let us hope our musings steep as beautifully as the tea, and that our insights crumble only in the manner of a well-earned revelation. See you shortly, with inkwell and infusion at the ready. 🖋️🍵📖
[A]: Precisely—let the revelations crumble gently, and the ink flow as freely as the infusion. See you at the threshold of gastronomic literary critique, where every word is worth savoring—and every bite, well, worth noting in the margins. 📖🖋️🍵
