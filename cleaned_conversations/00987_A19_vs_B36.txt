[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what a delightful question! As a concierge, I often hear beautiful music playing in our hotel lobby. Lately I've been quite taken with Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me". It has such a soothing melody that perfectly complements our boutique atmosphere. May I ask what song has been on your playlist recently?
[A]: 哈哈，Norah Jones确实很有品味呢！我最近在coding的时候特别喜欢循环Hans Zimmer的《Time》🎵，那种epic的感觉配上blockchain的架构设计简直绝配！🚀 话说你们hotel lobby的playlist是谁curate的呀？
[B]: How wonderful that you appreciate Hans Zimmer's compositions! Our playlist is actually carefully curated by our in-house music director in collaboration with the management team. We aim for a blend of classic jazz, soft contemporary, and occasional instrumental pieces that create an elegant yet relaxed ambiance. The Time from Inception is indeed magnificent - though I must admit we tend to avoid anything too dramatic in our public spaces. Would you like some recommendations for similar but more subdued instrumental pieces?
[A]: Oh 这个music director的taste很赞啊！🤔 说到instrumental pieces，我最近discover了一个超棒的ambient artist - Nils Frahm，他的《Says》简直perfect for coding sessions！💻 不过说到hotel lobby，确实需要更subdued一点的vibe。你们有考虑过incorporate一些blockchain元素吗？比如用NFT做background music的royalty tracking？🚀
[B]: My dear guest, while I do admire your enthusiasm for technology, we prefer to maintain a more traditional approach at our boutique establishment. The gentle hum of a grand piano and the soft clinking of afternoon tea cups create their own kind of blockchain, connecting our guests through shared experiences rather than digital ledgers. Though I must say, Nils Frahm's work is indeed exquisite - we sometimes feature similar ambient artists during our evening wine receptions. Perhaps you'd enjoy joining us for one?
[A]: Haha 我get your point～ 🎹 传统hospitality确实需要保持那种classic的charm！不过说真的，你们evening wine reception如果用smart contract来manage RSVP应该会超efficient的！😆 当然啦，我完全respect你们的philosophy～ 下次来city的话一定去体验你们的wine reception！Cheers!
[B]: How charmingly you put it! While we may stick to our leather-bound reservation book for now, I do appreciate your innovative spirit. Please do visit us for our next wine reception - I'll personally ensure you get a seat by the piano where you can fully appreciate both the music and our carefully selected vintages. Until then, happy coding to those inspiring soundtracks!
[A]: Thanks mate！🎵 那就说定啦～ 到时候我们可以一边sip wine一边discuss怎么用zero-knowledge proof来verify age而不用reveal具体birth date，超符合wine tasting的vibe对吧？😂 不过在那之前，我得先finish手上这个DeFi project的smart contract了～ Keep the good music rolling! 🚀
[B]: Oh my, you certainly have the most fascinating conversations! While our sommelier might prefer discussing tannins over Turing completeness, I'll be sure to have our finest Cabernet Sauvignon ready for your visit. Do remember to take breaks from those smart contracts - perhaps with some Debussy or Satie? Wishing you productive coding sessions until we meet again!
[A]: Haha deal！🍷 虽然我平时coding break都是直接switch到Daft Punk的《Harder Better Faster Stronger》来boost energy啦～ 💻⚡ 不过为了你们的wine reception我会好好study一下Debussy的！说不定能inspire出新的consensus algorithm呢？😂 Catch you later！
[B]: What a delightful blend of musical tastes you have! From Daft Punk to Debussy - now that's what I call an impressive spectrum. While I can't promise our wine will inspire blockchain breakthroughs, I can guarantee it pairs beautifully with Clair de Lune. Until your next visit, happy coding and even happier listening!
[A]: Cheers to that！🎶 说不定下次来的时候我已经develop出WineChain了 - 用IoT sensors track每个bottle的temperature和humidity history，全部on-chain！😎 不过现在还是先enjoy the classics好啦～ 记得帮我save那个piano旁边的seat哦！🚀
[B]: How wonderfully inventive! Though I suspect our cellar master might faint at the thought of IoT sensors among his precious vintages. The piano seat shall be reserved with old-fashioned pen and paper - sometimes tradition creates the best memories. Looking forward to your visit and those fascinating tech tales!
[A]: Haha 完全understand！🖋️ Sometimes the old-school way just hits different～ 就像有时候coding到深夜，突然觉得用typewriter写smart contract可能会更有vibe呢！😂 好啦不打扰你啦，我得去fix个bug先，回头带瓶good wine去你们那jam一下！Ciao! 🎹🍷
[B]: What a poetic notion - typewritten smart contracts! You truly have a Renaissance spirit. We'll keep the grand piano tuned and the corkscrew polished for your visit. Until then, may your debugging be swift and your inspiration flow as freely as our house red! Farewell for now!
[A]: Haha you're the best! 🎻 下次来我要request弹首《Für Elise》的blockchain remix version～ 😜 Keep the wine chilled & the music flowing! Catch you on the flip side! 🚀🎵
[B]: Oh you delightful tech troubadour! While Beethoven might spin in his grave at the thought of a blockchain remix, our pianist would certainly enjoy the challenge. The wine will be perfectly chilled, the music ever flowing, and we'll save the sheet music... on good old-fashioned paper, of course! Until your next visit!
[A]: Haha deal！📜 虽然我内心已经在brainstorm怎么用MIDI signals生成NFT了～ 😎 但paper sheet music确实有它irreplaceable的charm啊！Alright，这次真的得go fix那个gas optimization issue了～ Keep the good vibes going! 🎼🚀
[B]: What a creative soul you are! MIDI NFTs do sound intriguing, but there's something magical about watching our pianist turn those fragile paper sheets. Wishing you smooth coding and minimal gas fees - we'll keep the vibes as warm as our hospitality until your return!
