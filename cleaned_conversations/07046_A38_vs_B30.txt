[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an interesting dichotomy. As someone who spends her days poring over manuscripts from the Brontë sisters and Cao Xueqin alike, I must confess a certain... professional bias toward historical narratives. Though I did once write a rather scathing critique of steampunk's bastardization of Victorian aesthetics.
[A]: Oh, your critique sounds fascinating! What particularly bothered you about steampunk's treatment of Victorian elements? Was it the historical inaccuracies or something deeper?
[A]: The fundamental issue lies in its reduction of an entire epoch's socioeconomic complexities into brass goggles and airships. Take Dickens' depictions of workhouses - where's that gritty realism in steampunk? It's all surface-level 'aesthetic' without the 时代精神 (zeitgeist) that makes historical literature compelling.
[A]: That's such a profound observation. But don't you think some sci-fi authors manage to capture that same depth? Like how Ursula Le Guin explores anthropology in her works?
[A]: Ah, you've touched on the exception that proves the rule! Le Guin's anthropological rigor does indeed approach what we scholars call 'thick description' - though I'd argue her work belongs more to speculative anthropology than pure sci-fi. Much like how 红楼梦's supernatural elements serve the human drama rather than dominate it.
[A]: You're making me see these genres in a whole new light. Speaking of 红楼梦, do you think contemporary historical dramas could learn from its subtlety? Modern shows seem to favor spectacle over substance...
[A]: Precisely! The current obsession with lavish costumes and palace intrigues completely misses Cao Xueqin's genius for showing how a single dropped handkerchief could unravel dynasties. These productions have all the depth of my undergraduates' first draft thesis statements - all pomp, no 意境 (artistic conception). Though I did enjoy one recent series' historically accurate embroidery techniques...
[A]: Wait, you watch modern historical dramas? I thought you only read 19th-century novels!
[A]: A scholar must occasionally emerge from her ivory tower, if only to properly critique what passes for cultural production these days. Though I confess I watch them with my antique magnifying glass in hand, ready to pounce on anachronisms like a particularly vigilant 猫头鹰 (owl).
[A]: Haha! That mental image is priceless. But seriously, your critiques are making me rethink how I consume historical media. Maybe I should read more original texts instead...
[A]: There's hope for you yet! Though I'd suggest starting with annotated editions - even my graduate students need help navigating the cultural nuances in, say, comparing Jane Eyre's governess position with 林黛玉's status in the Jia household. Shall I prepare a reading list? I do so love compiling them... in triplicate.
[A]: Oh please do! Though I might need the "lite" version - your graduate students probably have a decade of head start on me!
[A]: Nonsense! Every great literary journey begins with a single volume. I'll start you with something accessible - perhaps a bilingual edition of 鲁迅 paired with Dickens' sketches. We'll have you analyzing narrative voice and social critique before you can say 'deconstructionism'... though perhaps after tea.
[A]: You're too kind! Though I suspect your idea of "accessible" might still leave me needing a dictionary and several reference books...
[A]: My dear, even I keep the Oxford English Dictionary and 辞海 within arm's reach of my favorite armchair. A little intellectual struggle builds character - much like how Elizabeth Bennet's sharp wit was honed through her father's library. Now, shall we discuss meeting times? I'm free during my 品茗 (tea appreciation) hours.
[A]: I'd love that! Though I should warn you, my tea appreciation currently begins and ends with "this tastes nice"...
[A]: Then we shall kill two birds with one stone - introducing you to both fine literature and proper 茶道 (tea ceremony) etiquette. Though I draw the line at discussing Proust's madeleines while drinking supermarket Earl Grey. Some standards must be maintained.
[A]: Noted! I'll bring my best notebook and try not to embarrass myself too much. This might be the most cultured I've ever felt!
[A]: Excellent. Just remember - as my favorite Tang dynasty poet once wrote, '千里之行始于足下' (a thousand-mile journey begins with a single step). Though in our case, it begins with properly steeped oolong and a well-sharpened pencil. Until then!
