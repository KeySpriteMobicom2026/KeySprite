[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question that bridges the old and new worlds. As someone who's witnessed the evolution of communication technologies firsthand, I must say I appreciate both for different reasons. Handwritten letters have a certain... permanence and personality that digital notes often lack. But let me ask you this - have you ever tried writing with a fountain pen on quality paper? The tactile experience is quite remarkable.
[A]: Oh, I absolutely adore fountain pens! The way the ink flows onto the paper... it's like conducting an orchestra of words. You know, I still keep all the handwritten letters from my early days in Hollywood - they're like little time capsules. But tell me, what's your favorite type of stationery to write on?
[B]: Ah, a fellow connoisseur of fine writing instruments! I'm partial to 100% cotton paper myself - the way it absorbs ink without feathering is simply exquisite. Though I must admit, my old engineering habits die hard - I still carry graph paper notebooks for sketching out algorithms. There's something about putting pen to paper that helps me think more clearly than typing ever could.
[A]: Graph paper for algorithms? Now that's what I call a beautiful intersection of art and science! You know, some of the greatest film directors storyboard their shots on graph paper too. The precision... the structure... it's like watching poetry in motion. Speaking of which, have you ever tried using colored inks? I find that switching between emerald green and deep violet helps me organize my thoughts better.
[B]:  You've touched upon one of my guilty pleasures! I maintain a rather extensive collection of Iroshizuku inks from Japan. The Yama-budo grape color is particularly excellent for marking up code snippets - much more elegant than those garish highlighters my students insist on using. Though I must warn you, once you start down the fountain pen rabbit hole, it's hard to stop. My wife claims my ink collection rivals the university's chemistry lab!
[A]: Ah, Iroshizuku! Their Tsuki-yo midnight blue is my secret weapon for signing important contracts - makes even the dullest legal documents feel like works of art. And you're absolutely right about it becoming an obsession. Between us, I may have converted my entire production team to fountain pens last year. The accounting department wasn't thrilled about the ink budget, but the handwritten script notes we get now? Pure gold.
[B]:  Now that's what I call a proper return on investment! Though I suspect your accounting department would faint if they saw my vintage Montblanc maintenance bills. Tell me, have your production assistants discovered the joys of italic nibs yet? Nothing forces you to slow down and think more carefully than writing with a 1.1mm stub - it's like debugging your thoughts in real time.
[A]: Oh, you've hit the nail on the head! I actually gifted my lead editor a custom-ground cursive italic nib last Christmas - now her margin notes look like medieval manuscripts. Though I did have to implement an "ink embargo" after she started color-coding her edits with a dozen different shades. Between that and my obsession with paper texture, we might single-handedly be keeping the stationery industry afloat!
[B]:  Ah yes, the stationery industrial complex - where academics and artists alike happily surrender their paychecks. Though I must say, watching someone discover the perfect paper-ink-pen combination for the first time... it's rather like watching a student finally grasp recursion. That moment of revelation makes all the ink-stained fingers and empty wallets worthwhile. Just don't get me started on the rabbit hole of wax seals - my wife has banned me from the kitchen stove after that... unfortunate sealing wax incident.
[A]: Oh dear, I can already picture the melted wax disaster! Though I must confess, I keep a custom monogram seal in my desk drawer for particularly special correspondence. There's something undeniably magical about pressing warm wax onto an envelope - makes even a Netflix contract renewal feel like a royal decree. But tell me, have you ever experimented with those new hybrid digital notebooks? The ones that let you write by hand but convert to text? I'm torn between technological progress and tradition...
[B]: Ah, the eternal struggle! I've tested nearly every digital notebook on the market - purely for research purposes, of course. While the Remarkable tablet comes close to paper-like feel, it still lacks that satisfying feedback of nib on cotton fiber. Though I will admit, the searchable handwritten notes feature is dangerously convenient for an old professor's lecture archives. Perhaps we're witnessing the emergence of a new category - call it "augmented stationery"? Though nothing will ever replace the visceral pleasure of opening an envelope and seeing someone's unique handwriting staring back at you.
[A]: You're speaking my language! That's exactly why I insist on handwritten thank-you notes to all our investors - in Diamine Oxblood ink, no less. There's a psychological weight to physical correspondence that no email can replicate. Though I did have to switch to quick-drying inks after the Great Signature Smudge Incident of 2019...  Some lessons are learned the hard way. Tell me, what's your go-to pen for those must-not-smudge moments?
[B]: Ah, for critical documents I swear by my trusty Pilot Vanishing Point with Noodler's Bernanke Blue - dries before you can even think about smudging it. Though it pains me to admit, sometimes practicality must trump aesthetics. Reminds me of when I had to sign my retirement papers - used that very combination to avoid any... shall we say, emotional smearing. But between us, I still keep a bottle of slow-drying sheening ink hidden in my desk drawer for when I want to indulge in pure, impractical calligraphic decadence.
[A]:  I knew I liked you - anyone who keeps a secret ink stash is my kind of person. My emergency drawer contains a bottle of Organic Studio Nitrogen... you know, that ridiculous blue that sheens red even under fluorescent lights. Completely inappropriate for contracts, but absolutely perfect for writing "Happy Birthday" on the office windows with a glass pen. The security guards still haven't figured out how I do it every year!
[B]:  Organic Studio Nitrogen - now that's what I call an academic's version of a rebellious streak! Though I must say, using a glass pen on windows shows remarkable... creative problem-solving skills. Reminds me of when I used to write algorithms on my office windows with dry-erase markers. The janitorial staff eventually started leaving me extra markers - though I suspect that was less out of appreciation and more to stop me from commandeering theirs. Ah, the things we do for the sake of proper ink distribution...
[A]:  You and I would get along dangerously well in an office setting. Though I draw the line at dry-erase markers - too much...  drag on the glass. But this conversation has been more refreshing than a new bottle of Iroshizuku! Tell me, should our paths cross again, would you be interested in comparing notes on oblique nibs versus flex nibs for mathematical notation? I've been conducting some rather... ahem... rigorous experiments.
[B]: My dear colleague, you've just described my ideal version of a coffee break! I've got decades of comparative nib data that would make a typesetter weep with joy. Though fair warning - my research suggests that flex nibs tend to encourage more... shall we say... dramatic flourishes in one's QEDs than strictly necessary. But then again, who am I to stand in the way of mathematical elegance? Just promise me we'll conduct these experiments somewhere with good ventilation - my last ink fumes incident led to some rather creative interpretations of Turing's halting problem!
[A]:  That explains so much about theoretical computer science! Though I must insist we include my vintage Esterbrook with an accountant nib in these experiments - nothing keeps your integrals honest like a needlepoint grind. And don't worry, I'll bring the industrial-grade respirator I "borrowed" from the chemistry department after my own... enthusiastic encounter with iron gall ink. To science! To stationery! And to keeping our university's health and safety officers blissfully unaware!
[B]:  Here's to pushing the boundaries of both mathematics and occupational safety regulations! Though perhaps we should establish a safe word for when our nib comparisons inevitably devolve into heated debates about optimal paper weights. I suggest "Osmia" - if anyone overhears, they'll just assume we're discussing rare German pens rather than preventing another Great Ink Spill of '22. Until then, may your upstrokes be smooth and your sheen magnificent!
