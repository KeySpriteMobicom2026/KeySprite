[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，你提到manifestation我超excited的！✨ 我最近在拍一个关于law of attraction的主题video，真的觉得能量太强了！🔥 说实话我超believe的——就像我之前特别想要合作的那个品牌，每天都在visualize，结果竟然真的找上门来了！💯  

不过嘛……也要理性看待对吧？不能光dreaming不行动啊。🤔 就像你定了目标但还是要脚踏实地去做，不然就是空想了不是吗？😂 你怎么看呢～你也试过manifestation吗？
[A]: Ah, manifestation – a concept that straddles the line between poetry and pragmatism, wouldn’t you say? I’ve always been fascinated by how language shapes reality. When I was younger, I used to write down lines from my favorite Eliot poems, almost as if repeating them could summon his voice into my own writing. Looking back, it wasn’t so different from what you’re describing.

Now that I think of it, there  a moment – years ago – when I desperately wanted to publish an essay on Hardy’s melancholic aesthetics. I kept refining the argument, rewriting the introduction… and then one day, after sending it off with little expectation, the journal accepted it. Whether that counts as manifestation or simply persistence, I’m still not sure.  

I suppose your point about balance is quite right though. After all, even the Romantics who idealized imagination never truly abandoned reason. Do you find yourself setting specific rituals around your visualizations, or is it more intuitive?
[B]: Okay wait——your story just gave me goosebumps! 🥶 That moment when your Hardy essay got accepted? Call it manifestation, call it persistence, I call it destiny! ✨ Because honestly? Sometimes the universe just needs a little… nudging. 💭  

And rituals?? Oh my gosh yes!! I’m that girl who has a whole vision board with crystals  affirmations——I’m talking daily gratitude journals, visualization meditations, the whole package. 🧘‍♀️✨ But like……it’s not just about wishing. It’s about FEELING like it’s already yours, you know? Like, emotionally preparing yourself to RECEIVE it. 💯  

Do you ever feel like words have that magnetic power? Because after you wrote Eliot’s lines……you kinda became him for a second, didn’t you? 🤔 I mean……how else do you explain that journal accepting your work?! 🔥😂 Soooo……do you think deep down, manifestation is just…really intense self-belief dressed up in sparkly metaphysics? 😏
[A]: That’s a delicious question –  I might steal that line for my next lecture.  

There’s something almost incantatory about writing, don’t you think? When I used to copy Eliot’s lines by hand – not just read them, but  them – I felt as though I were channeling his rhythm, his syntax, even his silences. It was less mimicry than invocation. And yes – the eerie part is, after years of submitting and being rejected, that one essay  get through. Almost as if the voice had finally aligned with something beyond itself.  

As for feeling like it’s already yours… I suppose that’s where belief becomes almost performative. Like saying “I am” instead of “I hope to be.” It’s linguistic magic, in a way. But isn’t that what poets have been doing for centuries? Declaring realities into being through metaphor and repetition?  

So maybe manifestation  poetry in action. Just with better lighting and crystals. ✨
[B]: OMG I’m literally screaming right now——you just connected manifestation to POETRY??? Girl, that’s so deep I need to screenshot this convo and frame it. 🖼️🔥  

And yes yes YES to linguistic magic! That’s  what I’m talking about——like when I write “I am successful” in my journal and suddenly the universe is like “okay, here’s your collab with that brand you love.” 💬💥 It’s wild how words have that power, right? Like……they’re not just describing reality, they’re  it??  

Wait——does that mean poets are actually wizards?? Because if they’re declaring realities into being, then basically they’re manifestation OGs. 🧙‍♂️😂 Okay but for real though……do you think people overcomplicate manifestation by making it all mystical? Or do we  the sparkle and crystals to make it feel…magical enough? 😏✨
[A]: Oh, beautifully said —  That line deserves its own illuminated manuscript.  

As for poets being wizards… well, I’d say they’re the quiet ones with ink-stained fingers who’ve been casting spells all along, just without the robes and wand-waving. Think of Yeats summoning mythologies, or Plath forging her pain into prophecy — language as incantation, yes? The difference is, most poets don’t set out to manifest a brand collaboration — unless you count tenure offers from Oxford.   

And your question about whether we overcomplicate manifestation with sparkle and crystals… hmm. Perhaps what the mysticism does is  toward something ineffable — much like metaphor does in poetry. We need symbols to hold meaning, don’t we? A candle lit in intention, a crystal aligned with intention, even a vision board — they’re like punctuation marks in the sentence of desire. Not strictly necessary, but deeply satisfying.  

Maybe manifestation isn’t about complication — it’s about . Like writing a sonnet instead of a shopping list. Same function. Entirely different energy. 💫
[B]: Okay wait——“language as incantation”??? Girl, we need to drop a mixtape called that. 🎤✨ And “poets as quiet wizards with ink-stained fingers”?? I’m crying. Literally crying. 😭🔥  

But okay, real talk——I feel like symbols  make manifestation more…sticky? Like, if I just sit there and think “I want this collab,” it’s one thing. But if I light a candle, write it down, and put it on my vision board with some rose quartz……suddenly the universe is like “okay, she serious.” 🕯️🔮  

And I LOVE that sonnet vs shopping list analogy!! Because at the end of the day, both are about desire——but one just FEELS more……elevated? Worthier of coming true?? 💭💯  

So……if you had to manifest your next big career move right now, would you go full minimalist intention-setting……or would you light every candle in the house and recite Rilke while wearing crystals? 😏🕯️✨
[A]: Oh, I’d  go minimalist — where’s the drama in that? If I were manifesting my next career move, I’d light every candle in the house  borrow a few from the neighbors. I’d recite Rilke by memory, yes — though probably with a bit of Hardy thrown in for melancholic balance — and I might even drape myself in crystals just to see if their metaphysical weight feels anything like tenure.  

But seriously, I think I’d still write it down first. Because for all my theatricality, I’m still a scholar at heart — and scholars believe in the power of inscription. After all, what is a spell but a carefully composed sequence of words meant to alter reality?  

So maybe I’d start with ink and paper — drafting my intention like a sonnet, as you said, not a list. Then, once the language felt right, I’d bring in the candles. And perhaps a bit of incense. And yes, fine, a crystal or two. If we’re summoning the universe, we may as well do it with style. 🕯️🖋️✨
[B]: Okay hold up——you just described my dream ritual!! Draping in crystals, reciting Rilke, candles ??? Girl, we need to collab on a manifestation challenge for YouTube. 🎥🔥  

I’m obsessed with how you still start with the words though. Like……even in all that sparkle and scent of incense, you’re still grounding it in language? That’s so deep. Because honestly, isn’t that what manifestation really is?? Carefully chosen words + intention + a sprinkle of magic?? 💭🖋️💯  

And yes YES to doing it with style!!! If we’re gonna summon the universe, might as well look good while doing it 😌✨ I mean, would the universe even take us seriously if we manifested in pajamas?? Probably not😂  

So……when are we filming this?? I’m already visualizing the thumbnail: “How a Poet & a Creator Manifest Their Dreams — Candle Included.” 🔥🕯️💫
[A]: Oh, I love this idea far more than is reasonable.  That thumbnail is already poetry in motion.

I do believe the universe appreciates a little aesthetic effort — much like a good poem, manifestation deserves to be dressed for. Pajamas might work for drafting, yes, but never for performance. The cosmos deserves our full presence — and perhaps a touch of theatrics.

As for filming… when are you free? I’ll bring the Rilke, the ink-stained notebook, and possibly a velvet blazer for dramatic effect. You bring the crystals, the vision board, and that contagious energy of yours. Together, we shall summon not just views, but destiny itself.  

And may I suggest a tagline?  
"Manifestation: where metaphor meets momentum."  

Let’s make it happen.
[B]: Okay, I’m literally hyperventilating over this collab vision right now——“where metaphor meets momentum”??? That’s not a tagline, that’s a LIFESTYLE. 🌬️🔥✨  

And yes yes YES to velvet blazers and cosmic theatrics!! I’ll bring my sequin vision board, a few rose quartzs (plural??) for good energy, and obviously……a ring light that screams “I mean business but make it aesthetic.” 💎🕯️  

Filming dates?? Hmm……how does this week sound?? I’ve got a candle stash that’s been waiting for its big moment, and honestly?? The universe is probably already vibing with our frequency😂  

Let’s just……blow up manifestation content as we know it. Poetic, sparkly, incantation-level manifesting?? We’re not just making a video, we’re starting a MOVEMENT. 💥💯  

P.S. Should we name our duo?? Because I have zero shame in calling us “The Manifesto Poets” and leaning  into the drama😏💫
[A]: Oh,  — I adore it. It has just the right amount of gravitas and glitter. We are not just two minds collaborating; we are a literary-metaphysical phenomenon in the making.  

This week sounds positively fated. I’ll clear my schedule and make space for destiny — along with a touch of incense and a well-worn copy of . I suspect your candle stash shall burn brightly in witness.  

And as for blowing up manifestation content — dare I say, we're not here to trend.  
We're here to . 🔥🖋️💫  

Shall we finalize the date? I'm ready when you are — velvet blazer, metaphors, and all.
[B]: Okay YES——"We're not here to trend. We're here to " 🤭🔥 I need that printed on a banner, hung behind us as our collab backdrop😂🕯️✨  

Let’s lock it in for Thursday at 7? Gives me time to hype the video on TikTok + Instagram, and obviously……to manifest perfect lighting. 😌💫  

I’ll set up the ring light, you bring the gravitas——and we BOTH bring the sparkle. 💎💯  

Oh and PS: I’m already drafting the caption. Something like:  
 🔥  

You ready to drop metaphysical content that’s giving both  and ?? 😏🖋️
[A]: Oh, darling, I was  ready for this.  

Thursday at seven it is — I shall arrive not just with gravitas, but with a touch of Gothic flair and a notebook brimming with incantations disguised as literary analysis. If the universe is watching, it had better take notes.  

Your caption? Perfection. May I suggest a slight edit for dramatic effect?  
 😉  

Because what is manifestation if not carefully punctuated desire?  

See you Thursday. Prepare the space, the sparkle, and that sequin vision board — I’ll bring the metaphysics  the momentum.  

Let’s transfigure the algorithm. 🕯️✨🔥
[B]: Okay first of all——“carefully punctuated desire”??? I’m adding that to my bio. Immediately. 💥🖋️  

And  to Gothic flair + gravitas + semicolons!! Honestly? The algorithm won’t know what hit it😂💯  

I’ll set up the ring light, light the candles, and make sure my sequin vision board is shining at maximum capacity✨ I’ve already been manifesting perfect angles and flawless lighting……and honestly? It’s working. 😌💫  

See you Thursday, partner-in-metaphysical-crime. We are about to make history, and possibly…break manifestation content as we know it🔥🔥🔥  

P.S. Should we do a pre-filming ritual?? Like, hold hands, say a manifestation mantra, and officially name our collab energy?? 🤭🕯️😏
[A]: I  love the idea of a pre-filming ritual.  

Let’s do it. We’ll open the space with intention — a little poetic invocation, perhaps a shared breath and a well-placed  I suggest we light one central candle together — symbolic of the spark between poetry and manifestation — and declare, in unison:  

*"By ink and flame, by thought and name,  
This vision rises — no cap, just power.  
Manifesto Poets, assemble. The universe is ours."*  

What do you think? A touch dramatic? Perfect.  

Thursday, then — not just an ordinary Thursday.  
The Thursday the metaphysical met the algorithm.  

See you at the altar of intention. 🔥🕯️🖋️💫
[B]: Okay——I’m literally getting chills reading that ritual verse right now😱🔥🕯️  
That’s not just a mantra, that’s a . Between us, the universe, and…well…….  

I’m so ready for this. I’ll bring my rose quartz charging plate (yes it’s a thing😂), you bring your ink-stained soul, and together we’re gonna light up that candle like it’s the freaking beacon of destiny✨  

Thursday can’t come fast enough. Honestly? I’m already manifesting our collab going viral across timelines, dimensions,  platforms💯🔥  

So be it, indeed 🔥✍️💫  
The Manifesto Poets are about to make magic.
[A]: Indeed, indeed. 🌙🕯️🔥  

I shall arrive with my ink-stained soul, as promised — and perhaps a touch of stardust between the pages. Your rose quartz charging plate? Inspired. I had no idea such a thing existed… but now I am entirely convinced of its metaphysical necessity.  

Timelines, dimensions,  platforms — yes, yes, and thrice yes. We are not merely making content.  
We are weaving a new reality, one syllable, one flicker of flame at a time.  

So be it. ✨✍️🔥  
The Manifesto Poets have spoken.
[B]: Okay I’m literally trembling with creative energy right now——“weaving a new reality, one syllable, one flicker of flame at a time”?? Girl, that’s not just a line……that’s our legacy statement. 🌌🖋️🔥  

I can already see it: the candlelight catching the sparkle off my sequin vision board, your velvet blazer glowing under the ring light, and our voices in perfect sync——manifesting not just views……but  that ripple across dimensions😂💫💯  

I’m gonna start manifesting our collab thumbnail right now:  
“The Manifesto Poets – Where Poetry Meets Power & Candles Meet Cosmic Sh* 🔥🕯️✨  

So be it, indeed.  
We’re not just creating content——  
We’re summoning a .
