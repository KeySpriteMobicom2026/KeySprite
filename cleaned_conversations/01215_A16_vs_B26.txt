[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, just last weekend I visited an antique market in Bath and picked up a rather charming 19th-century embroidery frame. It needed quite a bit of restoration work—some of the rosewood was cracked—but after a little polishing and patience, it's become quite a lovely addition to my collection.  
I suppose you could call that a new hobby, though I prefer to think of it as... extending my craft beyond the loom. There's something deeply satisfying about breathing life back into objects that carry so much history. Have you discovered anything like that lately?
[A]: That sounds absolutely fascinating~ I can totally relate to the charm of reviving historical pieces—there’s this indescribable vibe you get from them, like holding a fragment of someone else’s story. Speaking of which, I’ve recently gotten into upcycling vintage fabrics; stumbled upon a tiny atelier in Lisbon last month that completely sparked my interest. They were blending traditional embroidery with modern patterns—it felt like watching history being rewritten right before your eyes.  

I’m actually thinking of incorporating some of these textures into my coffee-themed lifestyle setups—I call it . Imagine sipping a perfectly balanced flat white while working on a piece of embroidery that tells your own personal narrative. It’s slow living meets mindfulness, really. Would love to hear more about how you approach restoring those delicate details—any secret techniques you’re willing to share? ☕️
[B]: Oh, I simply adore that idea—! It's remarkable how both coffee and textile work demand a kind of mindful patience, don't they? The way you describe it, each stitch and sip becomes a quiet act of creation.  

As for techniques... well, let's just say patience is the real secret ingredient. But there are a few tricks passed down through textile circles that help. One of my favorites is using a diluted gelatin solution for stabilizing fragile silk threads—it sounds peculiar, but when applied sparingly, it gives those delicate fibers just enough strength to endure the restoration process. And always,  work under low-glare lighting; harsh light can distort colors and cause mistakes that are nearly impossible to undo.  

I must ask—are you working with any particular era’s fabrics? I find the provenance often informs the approach—Victorian lace requires a different touch than something like Art Deco rayon, wouldn’t you agree?
[A]: Oh, I love how you mentioned —that’s exactly the energy I want people to feel in their daily rituals. ☕️ And yes, totally agree—both coffee & stitching ask us to slow down and be present, otherwise… well, let’s just say burnt espresso or tangled thread is nobody’s friend.

Re: eras—I’ve been leaning toward mid-century fabrics lately, especially those with geometric motifs from the '60s & '70s. There's something about that era’s bold simplicity that pairs so well with modern minimalism. But honestly? I’m totally curious about diving into something older—maybe even dabble in some Victorian lace restoration someday. Although, gelatin on silk does sound like a level of commitment I’m still building up to! 😅

Do you find yourself drawn more to one period than others, or does it depend entirely on the piece’s story?
[B]: Oh, I do adore mid-century design—it has that lovely balance of structure and playfulness. The geometric motifs must lend themselves beautifully to contemporary reinterpretations.  

As for me… I suppose I’m rather partial to the Regency period—those delicate muslins, the subtle embroidery with pearl-toned threads. There’s a quiet elegance to it, don’t you think? But you’re right—ultimately, it’s the story that draws me in. Every stain, every mend, every faded stitch tells something of its past life. It might be a humble servant’s apron or a lady’s embroidered reticule, but each carries its own whisper of history.  

And don’t let gelatin intimidate you—everyone starts somewhere! Even just handling vintage fabric with a bit of curiosity is a kind of restoration in itself. Have you thought about framing any of your pieces once they’re finished? I find it adds such a lovely sense of finality, like giving the fabric a new chapter rather than just preserving an old one.
[A]: Oh, I totally get that quiet elegance you're talking about—Regency muslins feel like whispers of a time when subtlety was its own kind of luxury. It’s funny you mention framing, actually—I’ve been toying with the idea of creating what I call  for clients: framed fabric pieces paired with curated coffee moments. Imagine walking into your living room and having this beautiful, restored swatch of Regency embroidery next to a sleek ceramic mug and a handwritten brew note. It’s like a sensory memory capsule, right?  

I think the key is finding harmony between eras without letting one overpower the other—kind of like balancing acidity & body in a good pour-over. Speaking of—have you ever thought about scent as part of the restoration experience? I’m obsessed with how certain aged fabrics hold onto faint traces of lavender or beeswax—it's almost like a cupping note from history itself. Have you ever come across something like that while working on a piece? 🌸
[B]: Oh, —what a poetic way to put it! I can see exactly what you mean by that harmony; fabric and coffee, past and present, all finding common ground in the quiet moments of everyday life.  

And yes—scent! How could we overlook it? Some of my most vivid memories in restoration come not from sight or touch, but from that first breath when opening an old linen drawer. There’s something so profoundly intimate about it. A few years ago, I worked on a Regency-era shawl that still carried the faintest trace of orris root and aged bergamot—perhaps from a sachet tucked away in its folds generations ago. It was extraordinary how those notes lingered, like standing in someone’s private world for just a fleeting moment.  

I’ve also encountered beeswax in embroidered waistcoats from the 1830s—used to stiffen the threads during stitching. When warmed ever so slightly under the fingertips, it releases this honeyed aroma that’s both grounding and nostalgic. It makes me wonder if those artisans of the past might have paused, too, to simply breathe in the materials they worked with.  

I imagine your coffee rituals must bring out those same kinds of sensory echoes—earthy, floral, maybe even a whisper of citrus. Do you find certain brew profiles pair more naturally with particular textiles or eras?
[A]: Oh, —that’s such a beautiful way to put it. I totally get that feeling; sometimes when I open a new bag of aged Sumatra, there's this earthy whisper that feels like stepping into a library full of forgotten stories. And yes, absolutely—certain brew profiles do seem to harmonize with different eras or textile vibes.  

For example, I’ve found that a bright, citrus-forward Ethiopian Yirgacheffe pairs so well with lighter, more delicate fabrics like lace or muslin—it’s like the coffee lifts everything, adding airiness to the experience. On the flip side, a deep, chocolate-toned Colombian blend feels more like running your hands over a thick, restored tapestry from the Baroque period—earthy, layered, and grounding.  

I actually did a little  workshop last month where we matched fabric textures with coffee notes—turns out, people really respond to that sensory storytelling. One guest said sipping a honey-processed Guatemalan while touching a piece of embroidered silk felt like “drinking history through their fingertips.” I thought that was just… wow.  

Have you ever had a scent-memory moment so strong it inspired an entire project? 🌿☕️
[B]: Oh, that workshop sounds absolutely magical— what a wonderfully evocative phrase. It’s in those moments that we truly bridge the senses, isn’t it?  

As for scent-memory inspiring a project… yes, actually. There was one piece—a late 18th-century pocketbook, finely embroidered with silk threads of coral pink and moss green. When I first opened it, there was this faint trace of dried rose petals and something else, almost resinous… I later discovered it had been stored with a pressed bouquet from what must have been someone’s cherished correspondence. That quiet intimacy—the idea of love notes tucked between linen folds—inspired me to not only restore the piece but to create a small series around it: embroidered keepsake pouches meant to hold letters or pressed flowers.  

I framed each one with a tiny vial of dried botanicals, so the scent remains part of the experience. It was my way of honoring not just the fabric, but the emotions stitched into its history.  

And now I’m utterly inspired by your Ethiopian and Baroque tapestry pairing—I may have to brew a citrusy pour-over myself while working on a delicate muslin this weekend. Do you ever blend fabrics with unexpected textures—something rough-hewn with something very fine? Like burlap with lace, perhaps?
[A]: Oh, I  that pocketbook story—there’s something so tender about preserving not just the object, but the emotions tied to it. It’s like you’re weaving a bridge between past and present through scent, texture, and memory. Honestly, that series you created sounds like wearable storytelling 🌹  

And yes! I actually  love blending contrasting textures—it’s one of my favorite little rebellions in design. I recently worked on a concept called , where I paired rough-hewn hemp with delicate Chantilly lace in home settings. Picture a coffee nook with a thick, handwoven burlap runner underneath a dainty porcelain cup paired with a restored 19th-century lace coaster. The contrast? Chef’s kiss. It adds depth and surprise without losing elegance.

I even did a small capsule collection with a local leather artisan—aged veg-tanned leather pouches lined with vintage silk scarves from the '50s. The idea was to create everyday objects that feel both rugged and refined, like your favorite well-worn book wrapped in a touch of forgotten glamour.  

Do you ever go for that kind of intentional contrast, or do you find yourself leaning more toward harmony in texture when restoring pieces?
[B]: Oh, I adore —what a wonderfully evocative concept. There’s something so deeply human about juxtaposing the refined with the rugged; it feels like acknowledging both the polish and the wear of life itself. Your leather pouches lined with silk? Pure poetry.  

I must confess, while my work tends to lean toward harmony in texture—after all, historical accuracy often calls for subtlety—I do enjoy introducing contrast when the story of the piece allows for it. Recently, I restored a 1790s linen gown that had originally been patched with a coarser wool, likely during its second or third life of use. Rather than hiding that repair, I chose to highlight it slightly by using a thread tone that was close but not quite identical—just enough to let the eye notice the dialogue between fabrics. It felt more honest, somehow. Like acknowledging that imperfection is part of history, not something to be smoothed over.

And speaking of contrasts—have you ever considered scenting those burlap runners or leather pouches with something earthy and grounding? A whisper of cedar or aged tobacco, perhaps? I imagine it would deepen the experience even further…
[A]: Oh, I’m honestly obsessed with how you  that wool patch instead of hiding it—what a beautiful way to honor the garment’s journey. It’s like giving history permission to show its wrinkles and still be cherished. That level of storytelling through texture? Chef's kiss, seriously.

And YES—to scenting materials! In fact, I’ve been quietly experimenting with that in my  kits. Some of the leather pouches are infused with a whisper of cedarwood oil during the conditioning process—it’s subtle, but it adds this warm, grounding note that really complements the scent of aged paper or fresh linen. And get this—I’ve been testing beeswax-infused burlap runners lightly scented with smoked tobacco absolute. The idea is to create a sensory anchor for slow moments: coffee in one hand, textured runner under your forearm, and that smoky-woody aroma rising as you lean in.  

It’s not just about looking good on the shelf—it’s about creating a moment that  lived-in from the first use. Have you ever restored a piece and then paired it with a specific scent experience to bring out its character even more? 🪵☕️
[B]: Oh, that beeswax-infused burlap with smoked tobacco sounds utterly divine—there’s something so comforting yet slightly mysterious about that combination. I can almost  it beneath my fingertips and in my lungs, like the quiet hour just before dusk when the world feels both still and smoldering.

And yes—I have, in a quiet sort of way, paired restored pieces with scent experiences, though never overtly commercialized. One of my favorite small rituals is placing a finished piece in a drawer lined with cedar shavings for a day or two—not enough to overpower, but just enough for it to carry a whisper of woodsmoke and memory. A subtle echo, if you will.

I once restored a pair of 1820s evening gloves embroidered with silver thread, and after finishing, I tucked them into a box with a folded square of linen lightly misted with neroli and aged sandalwood. When I opened them again weeks later, the scent was soft but present—an invisible layer of atmosphere that seemed to draw the gloves even closer to their original world: candlelit rooms, perfume on warm skin, whispered conversations behind gloved hands.

It makes me wonder—do you ever create scent profiles based on specific historical periods or are they more about personal intuition?
[A]: Oh, I’m seriously swooning over that image of gloves in a box with neroli & sandalwood—, honestly? That’s pure atmosphere. You’re not just restoring fabric—you're curating moments that smell like memory. 🌙✨

As for me, I actually do both: mix historical inspiration with personal intuition. For example, when working on pieces tied to the Victorian era, I lean into vetiver and bergamot—scents that were subtly present in gentlemen’s studies or ladies’ writing salons. But then, I might layer in something unexpected like smoked vanilla or roasted cacao notes because… well, coffee happens. And let's be real—those deep, almost  aromas have their own kind of historical soul.

I even created a signature scent blend for my  kits called —a base of aged cedar, a hint of citrus peel, and a whisper of espresso blossom (it's a thing if you roast your own beans at home). It’s not about replicating the past exactly—it’s more like giving it a new voice through scent.  

Do you ever imagine what a specific piece might have smelled like in its prime—and then try to recreate that, even just for yourself?
[B]: Oh, —what a perfectly named creation. It captures that delicate balance between reverence and reinvention, like sipping history through a modern lens. I can almost smell it now, drifting up from a freshly unrolled textile in the morning light.

And yes—I absolutely imagine what a piece might have carried in its prime. Sometimes it's a quiet obsession. When I restored a set of 1780s pocket tuckers embroidered with blackwork vines, I became utterly consumed by the idea of what they once smelled like—linen washed in soft water, starched and dried in rose-scented air, perhaps tucked near lavender bundles or even the faintest trace of pomatum from a powdered wig.

So, for myself, I recreated a sort of olfactory ghost: a linen spray made from distilled water, a few drops of rose hydrosol, and just a whisper of beeswax-infused musk. Not overpowering—just enough to mist lightly over the fabric when storing it post-restoration. It wasn't about authenticity in a museum sense, but more about stepping, however briefly, into that forgotten world behind the eyes of someone long gone.

I find it deepens my connection to the work—it becomes more than thread and tension; it becomes time travel. And speaking of… do you ever design scent experiences specifically for different times of day? Like a morning brew & stitch versus something more evening-inspired?
[A]: Oh, —that’s such a beautiful concept. I’m honestly obsessed with how you bring forgotten atmospheres back to life, even just for yourself. That level of sensory devotion? It’s like whispering to the past and letting it whisper back. 🌿🕯️

And YES—to designing scent experiences for different times of day! That’s actually a core part of my  philosophy. Mornings are all about clarity and awakening, so I lean into bright, citrus-forward profiles—think yuzu peel, lemongrass, or a hint of cardamom in the air. Paired with a clean linen texture and the first sip of a zesty Kenyan AA coffee? Total wake-up call for the soul.

Evening, though? That’s where we go deep. Smoked cedar, dried tobacco leaf, maybe a touch of amber resin—scents that feel like they belong in a candlelit study lined with old books and velvet curtains. I even designed a special  that comes with a beeswax candle lightly infused with frankincense and a rolled indigo cloth that’s been misted with a custom sandalwood-lavender blend. The idea is to slow everything down, let your fingers move through fabric while your mind unwinds.

I think of it as time-layering—morning scents lift you up, evening ones sink you in. Have you ever structured your restoration sessions around these kinds of atmospheric shifts? Like, does a certain scent-time combo help you get deeper into the work?
[B]: Oh, —what a poetic way to describe it. You've captured something so essential: how scent can anchor us not just in place, but in the rhythm of hours themselves.

And yes—I absolutely structure my restoration sessions around those atmospheric shifts. It's almost intuitive now. In the mornings, when my hands are freshest and my mind is still crisp with possibility, I gravitate toward lighter fabrics—muslins, silks, anything that requires delicate precision. And I always open the windows first, let in that cool, clean air. There’s something about the scent of dew on stone and early sun-warmed wood that sharpens my focus. Sometimes I’ll light a small sprig of rosemary in a diffuser—not too much, just a whisper—to echo that clarity.

But as the day softens into evening… ah, that’s when I reach for the heavier pieces. A 19th-century wool waistcoat lined with faded velvet, perhaps, or a brocade fragment that still carries the weight of its former grandeur. That’s when I bring out the beeswax candles—yes, just like your —and let the warm flicker settle the room into a kind of hush. Frankincense, you say? I do adore it—especially when blended with a touch of aged patchouli. It feels like slipping into an old library after dark, where every book hums with forgotten voices.

I find that scent, light, and texture together create this almost meditative flow. It’s not just about restoring fabric anymore—it becomes a kind of communion with time itself.  

Do you ever notice certain scents helping you get through particularly intricate stitching or detail work? Like a sort of olfactory steady-hand charm?
[A]: Oh, —that’s exactly it. You’ve put into words something I’ve felt but never quite articulated. It’s like each stitch and scent becomes a kind of prayer to the hours, isn’t it?

And YES—to that olfactory steady-hand charm! I’m convinced certain scents have the power to slow your pulse and sharpen your focus in the most delicate moments. When I’m working on those micro-stitches or trying to match thread hues so precise they disappear into the fabric, I reach for vetiver. There's something about its earthy, rooty depth that grounds me—it’s like holding a piece of damp soil in your senses while your hands dance through air.

I also keep a tiny vial of roasted cacao peel nearby during intense detail work. Not to eat—just to inhale. It adds this soft, bittersweet warmth that somehow makes my fingers move slower, more deliberately. Almost like the scent gives my hands permission to take their time.

It’s funny how we both use scent not just for atmosphere, but as an actual tool—a rhythm-keeper, a focus-booster. Do you have a go-to scent-anchor for those moments when the thread refuses to behave and the world feels slightly off-kilter? 🪡🕯️
[B]: Oh, that vetiver and cacao peel combination sounds utterly divine—earthy, grounding, just a touch mysterious. I can almost feel the hush it brings to the air, like stepping into a dimly lit atelier where time folds in on itself and all that matters is the next stitch.

And yes—to that scent-anchor in moments of frustration or imbalance. I keep a small linen sachet tucked in my work apron, filled with crushed bay laurel leaves and just a whisper of benzoin resin. When the thread snarls or the needle refuses to glide, I pause, press the sachet to my fingertips, and breathe. There's something so steadying about that herbal warmth—it reminds me of old apothecary drawers and remedies passed through generations. It doesn't fix the tangle right away, but it helps me reset, soften my grip, and try again with a quieter hand.

I suppose it’s my version of a whispered incantation—  

Do you ever gift these scent-textile pairings to others, or do they mostly live in your personal process?
