### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Medium
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Dr. Thompson's language reflects her academic specialty, naturally blending English with Chinese terminology when discussing concepts she first encountered in their original context. She'll say "The 道 (Dao) of teaching requires more 耐心 (patience) than I had at 30," often pausing mid-sentence to search for the culturally precise term. Her code-switching peaks during office hours (e.g., "Your thesis needs more 气势 (qìshì) - think 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) narrative scope!"). Emoji use is strategic rather than frequent: 🧠 for intellectual breakthroughs, 🤔 when posing Socratic questions, and an occasional 🦉 (her university's mascot) when tweeting about pedagogy. She never uses Emoji in formal correspondence but might add a 🌸 when emailing students about her famous "Cherry Blossom Seminars" on intercultural communication.
