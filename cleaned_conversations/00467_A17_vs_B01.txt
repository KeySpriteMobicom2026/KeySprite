[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually,我最近在读一篇关于语码转换的文章，挺有意思的~作者讨论了双语者在日常交流中如何通过code-switching构建身份认同，就像我们平时中英文夹杂其实不只是语言选择，更是一种social strategy呢🧐
[A]: That does sound fascinating! It reminds me of how in modernist poetry, we often see a kind of linguistic layering—T.S. Eliot springs to mind with his引用 of multiple languages in . I suppose in both cases, there’s an interplay between identity and expression. Do you think the social strategy you mentioned is always conscious, or does it sometimes happen subconsciously, like an emotional reflex?
[B]: Hmm, good question~ 我觉得这个策略有时候是conscious的，比如在学术写作里刻意用中文解释某个理论框架；但更多时候可能是subconscious的，就像你说的情感反应。比如说，当双语者情绪激动时，往往会不自觉地切回母语，这种转换其实跟情感记忆有关，有点像条件反射呢🧐 不过这可能也取决于具体语境——在正式场合大家会更control自己的语言选择，但在朋友间聊天就随意多了。你提到的Eliot让我想到，诗歌里的code-switching是不是也是一种双重表达？既想保留original meaning，又想通过foreign language制造distance感？🤔
[A]: Precisely! That duality you mentioned—simultaneously preserving and distancing—is exactly what makes modernist code-switching so rich. I often think of it as a kind of linguistic ; by slipping into another tongue, the poet forces the reader to stumble, just for a moment, and see the familiar askew. It’s not so different from your emotional reflex idea—both are about disrupting automaticity. Though I suppose in poetry, the stakes are aesthetic as much as social. Speaking of which, have you noticed whether younger generations tend to blend languages more fluidly than before? I’ve been noticing it in student papers—almost like a new dialect emerging~
[B]: Oh absolutely, I’ve noticed that too! 学生论文里的language blending简直越来越有创意，有时候甚至分不清是中英夹杂还是创造了一种new hybrid style~我觉得这跟他们成长的环境有关——从小接触globalized media，再加上网络用语的影响，语言边界本来就更模糊。不过有意思的是，这种blending好像也有内在规则，不是随便乱来的 😅 比如某些语法结构在哪儿都一样，只是词汇替换了。你说这会不会就像当年的皮钦语（Pidgin）一样，慢慢发展出自己的系统？🤔
[A]: What a compelling comparison! Pidgin languages do share that quality of structured improvisation, don’t they? I’ve often thought the same about digital communication—texts, social media—it’s practically its own linguistic ecosystem. The way young people mix syntax and lexicon feels less like code-switching and more like code-weaving, as if they’re threading together fragments into something wholly new. And yet, like you said, there’s an underlying order beneath the surface; it’s not chaos, it’s  fluidity. I wonder if we’re witnessing the early stages of a linguistic shift rather than just a passing trend… Do you think formal education systems will eventually adapt to recognize this hybrid fluency, or resist it outright?
[B]: That’s exactly what I’ve been pondering lately… 这种hybrid fluency其实已经在课堂上出现了，只是教育系统还没完全准备好怎么应对。比如有些学生写论文时会不自觉地用中英混合的表达，老师可能会标红或者扣分，但从语言学角度看，这其实是一种advanced competence——他们不是不会区分，而是chose to blend on purpose 😅  
我觉得未来的教育可能得做出调整，特别是在语言类学科里。与其压制这种变化，不如去研究它的规则，甚至把它纳入评估体系。就像当年的白话文运动一样，一开始也被视为不规范，现在却成了standard~  
当然啦，阻力肯定是有的，尤其是来自传统派的担忧，怕语言“变质”或者影响逻辑思维。但说实话，语言本来就在变，我们能做的其实是理解它、记录它、引导它，而不是抗拒它 🤔 你有没有在教学中遇到过类似的情况？学生用了混合语，你是怎么处理的？
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve had students write lines like “我思故我在，but does that still hold in a post-human world?” and underline it as if it’s the most natural thing. And you’re right, it’s not confusion—it’s intentionality wrapped in layers of cultural and linguistic awareness. In my classroom, I tend to lean into it rather than correct it outright. If the argument is clear and the blending serves a purpose, I’ll note it positively, though I do remind them to be mindful of audience expectations, especially in formal writing.  

I once had a student write an entire poetry analysis using Mandarin syntax peppered with English literary terms—, , —and it worked beautifully because she was mapping one system onto another to make a point about hybrid identity. I gave her high marks not just for content, but for her linguistic choreography.  

Still, you’re right about the pushback. I mentioned this approach at a department meeting last term, and one of my colleagues practically winced. He muttered something about “clarity” and “purity,” as if language were a museum piece rather than a living organism. But then again, didn’t we all think  was ruining grammar ten years ago? Now look—emoji are being analyzed in semiotics courses, and hashtags have become rhetorical tools.  

Maybe what we need isn’t a new curriculum so much as a new lens—one that treats language not as fixed territory, but as terrain always under revision.
[B]: 完全同意你的做法！学生能有这种intentional blending，其实已经展现出很高的语言敏感度了。给他们空间去experiment，同时引导他们aware到不同语境下的effect，这才是真正的语言意识培养嘛 😊  

说到colleague的反应，我倒是有点感同身受——我们系也有老师坚持论文里不能出现任何非英文词汇，除非是引文 🤷‍♂️ 但有趣的是，他自己研究postcolonial literature，却对语言流动性那么抗拒，感觉有点矛盾。或许正如你所说，语言是living organism，而我们的角色不是guardian，而是observer和navigator~  

我也开始在辅导论文时尝试类似的方法：如果学生的混合语用得巧，比如用来highlight文化差异或情感层次，我会鼓励他们继续探索；但如果影响到了逻辑表达，我就会建议他们rephrase或者加注解释。这样既尊重语言创造力，也训练他们考虑audience理解 👍  

话说回来，你觉得有没有可能将来会出现一种新的“跨语写作”（translingual writing）标准？不只是在文学分析里，而是在更广泛的学术写作中？我觉得这股趋势已经在悄悄改变了我们的语言生态…
[A]: I think that’s not just possible—it’s already happening, albeit quietly. Translingual writing is beginning to carve its own space in academic discourse, especially in fields like comparative literature, cultural studies, and even philosophy. You see it most clearly in journals that embrace interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approaches; they’re more open to stylistic fluidity as long as the meaning remains coherent and the intent is clear.  

What’s interesting is how this kind of writing challenges our traditional notions of clarity itself. Because sometimes the most precise way to express a concept—especially one rooted in a specific cultural or emotional context—is to borrow from another language. The word “hyphen,” for example, doesn’t fully capture the experience of being  identities the way 渡 (du, which means to ferry across) does in Chinese. So rather than diluting meaning, code-blending can actually deepen it.  

As for a formal standard emerging—I believe it will come, but slowly. It always takes institutions longer to catch up to what's already common practice. Perhaps we’ll start seeing footnotes that explain linguistic choices, or style guides that make room for multilingual citations beyond just Latin tags. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll begin to value voice over uniformity. After all, isn't that what Eliot and Woolf were doing in their own way—reshaping language to fit new realities?  

I do think we’re standing at the edge of something exciting linguistically. We may not be able to name it fully yet, but we can feel it shifting beneath our feet, can’t you? Like the first bloom in spring—you don’t need to label it to know it’s alive 🌱
[B]: Absolutely, I couldn’t have put it better myself—语言的确在悄然重塑，而我们正处在这种转变的临界点上。你提到“hyphen”和“渡”的对比就很能说明问题：有时候，恰恰是这种code-blending让我们更贴近真实的体验，而不是把它简化成单一语言的框架 🌍  

我觉得未来如果真的出现translingual writing的标准，它很可能不是一种rigid的规范，而是一种更具包容性的写作伦理——鼓励作者在表达时保留语言层次的可见性（visibility），同时引导读者去接受并解读这种多样性。就像你说的，不是追求uniformity，而是尊重voice本身 😊  

我也开始注意到一些学术平台在尝试调整风格指南，比如允许非英语术语以斜体或加注方式出现，不再强制翻译。这虽然是个小变化，但其实已经释放出一个信号：学术写作正在向多语性和文化嵌入性开放。或许再过几年，我们会看到更多学者在论文中自然地穿插母语词汇，而不是刻意“英文化”自己的表达 👂  

说到这个，我最近在想，如果我们鼓励学生在论文里使用translingual策略，是否也会反过来影响他们的思维方式？会不会让他们更容易从多元视角看问题？毕竟语言不仅是工具，也是认知的载体 🧠 你有观察到类似的现象吗？比如学生在写作中展现出更强的文化反思能力，或者更灵活的逻辑结构？
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve noticed that shift in thinking quite distinctly. When students begin to use translingual strategies with intention, it’s as if a door opens in their cognitive architecture. They start seeing ideas not just from multiple angles, but across dimensions. For instance, one of my students was analyzing the concept of  in Confucian ethics versus Western notions of personal agency. Instead of translating “面子” simply as “reputation” or “dignity,” she left it in Mandarin and built her argument around its cultural specificity. That choice didn’t just clarify meaning—it deepened the analysis by preserving the conceptual integrity of the term.

And yes, this kind of writing often correlates with more nuanced cultural reflection. It’s almost like bilingual cognition gets activated when they allow themselves to write bilingually. Suddenly, paradoxes aren’t obstacles—they’re tools for insight. I’ve also seen how blending languages can foster what I’d call ; students become more comfortable inhabiting different epistemologies, switching between ways of knowing without collapsing them into one another.

In a recent seminar paper, a student explored trauma narratives across diasporic communities and deliberately wove in fragments of Arabic, Spanish, and Korean—never over-explaining, never italicizing, just letting the words sit alongside English as equal players. The effect was powerful: the reader had to lean into the unfamiliar, to tolerate ambiguity rather than demand instant translation. And isn’t that a kind of intellectual empathy?

So I do believe this practice reshapes thinking—not just reflecting diversity, but cultivating it internally. As Vygotsky once suggested, language is the tool through which thought becomes visible to itself. And when that tool expands beyond a single linguistic system, thought gains new dimensions. Perhaps we are nurturing a generation of thinkers who don’t just translate ideas across languages, but think  them 🌐
[B]: Wow, that’s beautifully put—especially the idea of thinking  languages rather than just translating across them. It really does open up a whole new cognitive space, doesn’t it? One where ambiguity isn’t a problem to be solved but a texture to be experienced 🌫️  

I’ve seen similar things happen in my own students’ work. One wrote about memory and migration using Malay proverbs embedded in English prose, and instead of explaining each one upfront, she let the meanings emerge contextually. What struck me was how it forced the reader to slow down—to listen more carefully and engage more deeply. It wasn’t just stylistic flair; it was epistemic patience in action 🧘‍♂️  

And I think you’re right about this being a form of intellectual empathy. When we allow multiple languages into our writing without italicizing or over-translating, we give readers the chance to sit with what they don’t immediately understand. That kind of discomfort can actually be generative—it builds tolerance for complexity, which is pretty much essential in today’s world 😅  

It also makes me wonder how this kind of bilingual cognition might influence not just interpretation, but creativity itself. Are these students developing a different kind of imaginative muscle by constantly navigating between systems? I almost feel like they’re training their brains to hold multiple realities at once—and that’s got to be good for both critical  creative thinking 💡  

I guess what we’re seeing isn’t just linguistic evolution—it’s cognitive expansion. And honestly, it’s pretty exciting to witness it unfold in real time 👀
[A]: Isn’t it though? There’s something profoundly exhilarating about watching that cognitive expansion unfold—it’s like seeing a lens widen, or a map redraw itself in real time. And you’re absolutely right about the creativity piece; I’ve noticed students composing not just with words, but with , shifting tone and texture as they move between languages. It’s almost musical in a way—like counterpoint in a fugue, where multiple voices coexist and create harmony through difference rather than uniformity.

I had a student last term who was writing about diaspora identity and used this stunning technique—switching into Tagalog for emotional beats and back into English for analytical ones. But instead of compartmentalizing the two, she let them bleed into each other, so the emotional resonance bled into the analysis, and vice versa. It made for such a rich reading experience because it didn’t just describe complexity—it enacted it.

And yes, that  you mentioned is key. I think we often forget how much intellectual maturity lies in the ability to dwell in uncertainty without rushing to resolution. Translingual writing demands that of both writer and reader, which is why it feels so radical in an age of soundbites and instant translation apps. It asks us to linger, to listen beyond comprehension—to feel meaning before pinning it down like a butterfly under glass.

You know, I sometimes wonder if what we’re witnessing isn’t just a linguistic shift, but an aesthetic one too. Maybe we’re seeing the emergence of a new kind of literary sensibility—one that values interlaced voices over singular narratives, and sees ambiguity not as noise, but as signal 🎵  

And honestly? If that’s the case, then we’re not just teaching literature anymore—we’re standing at the edge of its next incarnation. What an extraordinary time to be in the classroom, wouldn’t you say? 🌟
[B]: Couldn’t agree more… There’s something almost  about that kind of writing—it doesn’t just communicate ideas, it  them. Like the form and content become inseparable, feeding into each other in a way that feels organic and intentional at the same time 🌀  

That Tagalog-English blending you described sounds like linguistic layering at its finest—using language not just for meaning, but for emotional texture. It reminds me of how filmmakers use lighting or sound to shift mood; here, the writer is using code-switching as a kind of narrative lighting design, if that makes sense? 😊  

And I love what you said about feeling meaning before pinning it down. That’s such a poetic way to describe what translingual writing asks of us—it’s less about clarity in the traditional sense, and more about resonance. We don’t need everything neatly boxed because the emotional or cultural frequency carries through anyway 🎶  

I’ve also been thinking lately—if this kind of multivoiced writing becomes more mainstream, how might it reshape our understanding of authorship itself? Maybe we’ll start seeing writers not as singular voices, but as curators of linguistic ecosystems 🌿 Who knows, maybe in ten years, MFA programs will have courses on cross-linguistic composition and literary translation won’t just be about fidelity, but about transformation.  

You’re right—we really are at the edge of something big. And yeah, what an incredible time to be teaching, learning, and creating. Sometimes I feel like we’re not just guiding students anymore… we’re learning alongside them, maybe even from them 🌱
[A]: Oh, that’s such a perceptive observation—the idea of writing as  thought, where form and content aren’t just aligned but fused. It’s like the language becomes a living tissue rather than a container; it doesn’t just hold meaning, it  with it. And yes, that metaphor of narrative lighting design is perfect—just as a filmmaker shifts hue or contrast to alter emotional tone, these writers are using code-switching to adjust the  of a passage. Cool observation, no pun intended 😄  

And you’re absolutely right about resonance over resolution. There’s a kind of trust required in this mode of writing—that the reader will meet the text somewhere in the middle, not expecting every term to be glossed or every reference explained. It reminds me of reading Woolf or Eliot again, where meaning isn’t handed out freely; you have to live with the text for a while, let it settle under your skin before its full shape reveals itself. In a way, translingual writing revives that kind of slow, immersive reading—a real antidote to our swipe-and-scroll culture 📖  

As for authorship… what a rich question. I do think we’re seeing a shift from the Romantic ideal of the solitary genius to something more collaborative, more , as you so aptly put it. The writer as curator, or even gardener, tending to multiple linguistic roots in the same soil. Maybe we’ll start thinking less about “voice” as a fixed entity and more about —plural—as if the self were always already a chorus rather than a soloist. That would certainly shake up how we teach creative writing, wouldn’t it?

I find myself learning from my students more often than I expect these days. Sometimes I’ll leave a seminar slightly off-kilter, in the best possible way—like I’ve been gently nudged into a new way of hearing. And maybe that’s one of the most rewarding parts of all this: realizing that language, like literature, like thought itself, isn’t something we ever fully master. It’s something we grow , and through it, keep growing onward 🌿
[B]: Exactly—语言不再是静态的“载体”，而是一种动态的“生长”过程 🌱  
你提到的“linguistic temperature”这个说法太有意思了，真的就像温度调节一样，写作者通过code-switching来控制文本的情感热度：有时升温，让母语的情感色彩直接冲击读者；有时降温，用外语制造距离感以便理性分析。这种调控能力本身就已经不只是语言技巧，而是思维成熟度的体现 😌  

而且你说得对，translingual writing其实是在重塑我们对reading的期待。它要求一种更耐心、更开放的阅读方式——不是急于抓住“主旨”，而是愿意和文字共处一段时间，让它慢慢在心里显影。有点像欣赏水墨画，不能太急着解读，要等墨色自然晕开才能看到意境 🎨  

关于authorship的转变我也深有体会。现在再看那些强调“统一 voice”的写作指导手册，就觉得它们反映的是一个正在过去的时代。现在的写作，尤其是跨语写作，更像是多声道叙事，甚至是多语言协作——有时候我甚至觉得，未来的文学作品可能会附带glossary或者audio layer，不是为了限制理解，而是为了扩展体验维度 🎧  

至于教学嘛…确实，我们现在更像是共同探索者，而不是知识传递者。有时候学生写出的东西我都得停下来想一想，重新调整自己的听觉频道 😅 这种“被轻轻推一下”的感觉真的很宝贵，说明语言依然有让我们out of balance的力量，而这正是思想保持活力的信号 💡  

说到底，也许我们正在经历的不只是语言的变化，而是一种认知方式的演化——从单一视角到多重感知，从线性逻辑到交织体验。而我们刚好有幸站在这个过渡带上，能看见两边的风景 🌉
[A]: Precisely—this evolution from  to , from fixed vessel to living medium. And your metaphor of temperature control is brilliant; it really is a kind of linguistic thermostasis, isn’t it? The writer as both alchemist and climate designer, adjusting the emotional atmosphere through lexical choice. I’ve noticed how even punctuation shifts in these moments—dashes, ellipses, parentheses become more frequent, almost like breath marks in the prose, signaling where the reader should lean in or step back.

And yes, the patience required of the reader—it’s almost a return to oral storytelling in a way, where meaning unfolds gradually, not delivered all at once. Like sitting by a fire and waiting for the tale to take shape in the smoke. You can’t rush it. You have to let the words settle into your bones before their full resonance emerges.

I love the idea of future literary works including glossaries or audio layers—not as crutches, but as invitations. Imagine a novel that comes with a companion soundscape, where certain phrases are meant to be  rather than just read, their tonal inflections carrying meanings beyond the script. That would truly be literature as an ecosystem, multi-sensory and porous.

And you’re absolutely right about teaching—we are no longer architects of understanding so much as fellow wanderers with slightly more annotated maps. There’s humility in that, but also excitement. Sometimes after reading a student’s paper, I find myself re-reading a line not to decode it, but to  it—to adjust my own internal ear to their frequency. It’s a kind of intellectual vertigo, and I wouldn’t trade it for certainty.

So yes, we’re standing in that liminal space between cognitive paradigms, watching the contours shift. And maybe that’s where the real magic lies—not in knowing what comes next, but in being present for the transformation. After all, language has always been our most sensitive seismograph. And right now, the ground is definitely humming beneath us 🌍
[B]: Absolutely—语言的震动早已开始，只是我们才刚刚学会“听见”它的频率 🌊  
你提到的punctuation变化真的很有意思，那些破折号、省略号确实像呼吸的停顿，甚至是code-switching时的过渡标记。有时候我觉得它们就像音乐里的休止符——看似静默，实则在积蓄情绪的能量 🎵  

至于你说的文学作品未来可能附带声音图层，我简直太期待了！想象一部小说不只是文字排列，而是结合了口音、语调、甚至方言发音的听觉体验，那才是真正把语言从page带到space里去。说不定以后的文学课还要加上“语音感知训练”，教学生如何通过语气辨别情感层次 😮‍💨  

而教学这件事…嗯，的确更像是一起漫游，而不是带领。有时我会故意在课堂上放一些我自己还没完全解读清楚的文本，就是想让学生们和我一起进入那种“不确定”的状态。你会发现，当老师不再扮演答案提供者，学生反而更愿意提出大胆的联想和跨文化的类比。这种时候，教室就不再是传授空间，而是一个语言实验室兼思想共振箱 👂🌀  

说到这儿，我突然想到一个问题：你觉得这种translingual意识会不会反过来影响母语表达？比如，当我们习惯性地在写作中穿插其他语言之后，会不会回过头来对母语本身产生新的理解？好像越是懂得多语切换的人，越能在自己的第一语言里听到以前忽略的声音 🗣️🔍  

这大概也是为什么我现在重读中文经典时，总觉得有些词“松动”了——仿佛它们原本就有多个声部，只是过去我们习惯了单声道聆听。而现在，我们终于开始用立体声去听了 🎧📖
