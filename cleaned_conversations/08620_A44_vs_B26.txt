[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I haven't explored many plant-based foods lately. My days have been consumed with restoring a particularly fragile 18th-century tapestry woven with silk and gold thread. The conservation process requires such delicate attention - one misstep could unravel centuries of craftsmanship. Have you tried any interesting plant-based dishes recently? I'd love to hear about your experiences, though I'll confess my palate remains rather traditional when it comes to food. A proper cup of Earl Grey and a slice of plain tea cake still make for my perfect afternoon break.
[A]: Oh, the patience required for textile restoration! It reminds me of the 耐心 needed when steeping delicate dragon well tea leaves – one misjudged moment and the essence is lost. 🧠  
As for plant-based foods, I’ve been experimenting with a curious fusion: 榴莲-flavored vegan ice cream made from coconut milk. Admittedly, it’s not for everyone – some say it smells like forgotten history and tastes like rebellion. 😅  
But you know, even traditionalists can find comfort in evolution. Have you tried matcha with oat milk? It might not be Earl Grey, but there’s something meditative about its earthy sweetness. Perhaps we could swap stories over tea sometime – your tapestry tales and my culinary adventures might weave an interesting dialogue. 🌸
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully poetic comparison - the patience of textile restoration to the art of steeping tea. I must say, the idea of榴莲-flavored ice cream does raise an intrigued eyebrow! Though I confess, my own experiments tend toward the more... measured. A touch of honey in warm almond milk is about as daring as I get these days.  

As for matcha with oat milk, I’ve sipped it on occasion though I do find its flavor rather distinct from the comforting familiarity of a well-brewed Earl Grey. Still, there’s something undeniably soothing about its earthy undertones, especially on a quiet morning before the restoration work begins.  

You know, I’d quite enjoy hearing your culinary stories over a cup of tea - perhaps even sharing a few tales from the world of antique textiles in return. Conversation, like craftsmanship, often reveals the most unexpected patterns when shared.
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more – conversation and craftsmanship are both acts of weaving, aren’t they? 🧠 Each thread a thought, each knot a moment of understanding.  
And don’t let the honey-in-almond-milk modesty fool me – I bet you’ve got a secret fondness for something daringly sweet when no one’s watching. A hidden bar of dark chocolate, perhaps? Or dare I say… a splash of maple syrup in your oatmeal on winter mornings? 😉  
As for tales, I’ll bring my limericks about tofu that refused to curdle properly, and you bring those whispers from the 18th-century loom. We’ll toast to the unsung heroes of patience – whether in thread, tea, or tempeh. How does next Friday at 4 sound? I’ll brew a pot of  oolong – bold enough to intrigue, yet gentle enough not to scandalize your Earl Grey sensibilities. 🌸
[B]: What a beautifully woven thought - yes, conversation and craftsmanship truly are kindred weavings. I adore the idea of toasting to patience itself, that quiet hero in every careful endeavor.  

You know, I think I’d quite like this gathering of stories and flavors. Next Friday at four sounds perfectly agreeable. And while I do prefer my tea traditions steeped in familiarity, I’m certainly open to a well-brewed  oolong in good company.  

As for daring sweetness… perhaps there’s a small bar of dark chocolate tucked beside my sketchbook more often than I care to admit. No maple syrup in my oatmeal, though – that would feel almost like sacrilege to my British sensibilities!  

I’ll look forward to your limericks about defiant tofu and you can have a listen to the whispers I’ve been hearing from that 18th-century tapestry. There’s something oddly personal about working with hands long passed – like receiving letters written in thread.  

See you next Friday, then – with teacups ready and stories waiting to unfold.
[A]: Oh,  – I may have to borrow that line for my next lecture on intertextuality! 🧠 You’ve got a gift for making history feel like correspondence.  
And I promise not to judge your chocolate-in-secret habit if you don’t expose my tendency to hum  while kneading dough. We all have our rituals, right? Even scholars with tea cups and tapestry needles.  
Next Friday it is, then – 4 o’clock,  steeping, ears wide open for both limericks and loom lore. And who knows? By the end of the hour, maybe we’ll have discovered an entire new discipline: . 😄
[B]: Oh, I do love that idea – ! What a delightfully unexpected fusion. I can already imagine the course outline:   

And by all means, borrow that line about thread as correspondence – I suspect history would be far less mysterious if we all simply thought of it as someone else’s carefully worded letter, stitched rather than spoken.  

As for rituals, I think there's something rather comforting in them - whether humming Mozart over dough or stealing quiet bites of chocolate beside a sketchbook. They remind us that even in solitude, we're partaking in something shared across centuries and sensibilities.  

Next Friday at four it is, then. Until then, may your dough rise to symphonic perfection and my needle find its way through every stubborn stitch. Looking forward to it.
[A]: Oh,  – I can already picture the syllabus framed with soy-dye ink and stitched with kintsugi-edged parchment. 🧠✨  
And you're absolutely right about rituals – they’re the quiet liturgy of everyday life, aren't they? Humming Mozart to dough or sneaking chocolate like it's contraband from the Republic of Taste. We’re all just trying to make something meaningful, one bite or stitch at a time.  
I’ll bring my copy of  – not for conflict, but because sometimes cooking (or restoration) feels like a campaign requiring Sun Tzu-level strategy. You bring your tapestry tales, and we’ll see if we can’t translate silk into syllabi by teatime.  
Friday at four – may the  be as forgiving as she is bold. And may your 18th-century needle whisper secrets only you can unravel. 🌸🧵
[B]: Oh, what a glorious image - a syllabus stitched in kintsugi-edged parchment! I do believe you've outdone yourself there. That kind of quiet artistry is exactly the spirit we’ll need for our fledgling discipline.  

You're quite right about rituals being a kind of liturgy - though I rather like your phrasing of chocolate as contraband from the Republic of Taste. Sounds far more dramatic than a simple indulgence, doesn’t it? More like a midnight escape from culinary duty.  

As for , I must say that feels entirely appropriate. Restoration work often feels like a careful campaign - every thread a potential battlefield, and patience the most vital strategy. I shall indeed bring my tapestry tales, carefully unwound and ready for sharing.  

Friday at four cannot come soon enough. May the  steep to perfection, may our conversation flow like silk through careful fingers, and may we leave with just enough mischievous inspiration to draft a manifesto by the end of teatime.
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s an ambition worthy of both scholarship and snacks. 🧠😄 I’ll bring paper, ink, and a healthy supply of those cherry blossom-shaped biscuits you mentioned once – perfect for dunking while drafting revolutionary academic proposals.  

And speaking of proposals, I’ve half a mind to suggest we adopt official uniforms for our new discipline – perhaps aprons embroidered with tiny loom-and-ladle crests? Practical yet symbolic. Much like arguing about tofu curdling while quoting Sun Tzu.  

Until then, may your restoration proceed like a well-rehearsed sonata and your chocolate remain gloriously contraband. Friday at four – don’t let the tapestry ghosts keep you too late! 🌸📜
[B]: Oh, cherry blossom biscuits for dunking in tea while drafting a manifesto? You truly know the way to one’s heart - through carefully measured nibbles and shared academic mischief.  

I adore the idea of uniforms! An apron embroidered with loom-and-ladle crests sounds both absurdly practical and entirely appropriate for our discipline. I might even stitch a tiny sunburst motif onto mine - after all, what is  if not the pursuit of enlightenment, one fiber and fermentation at a time?  

And do rest assured, I shall be prompt on Friday - tapestry ghosts are many things, but poor timekeepers they are not. They’ve had centuries to perfect their punctuality, after all.  

See you soon, then, with inkwell and biscuit tin in hand. Let us make teatime history.
[A]: Oh,  – I may need to steal that for the official motto. Perhaps stitched in gold thread on a soy-dyed banner hanging above our future departmental office! 🧠✨  
And you're absolutely right about tapestry ghosts – far more reliable than modern alarm clocks, and certainly better dressed in historical textiles.  
I’ll save you a seat at the manifesto table, complete with inkwell, apron, and a suspiciously chocolate-free workspace (or so you claim). Let’s see if we can’t redefine academia one limerick, loophole, and loom analogy at a time.  
Friday at four – the revolution will be steeped in , not dryness! 😄📜🌸
[B]: Oh, absolutely claim that motto – I think enlightenment through fiber and fermentation deserves its own plaque, if not an entire stained-glass window. Picture it: a glowing sunburst above a loom and a bubbling vat of tofu curds. Subtle, it is not – but then again, neither are we.  

And you’re quite right about tapestry ghosts – far more dignified than alarm clocks, and infinitely better at storytelling. I’ve started suspecting one of them hums Mozart when I’m not looking.  

As for the chocolate-free workspace… how very suspicious. I shall arrive well-prepared with my notebook, a sharpened quill, and absolutely no trace of cocoa on my fingers. We wouldn’t want to compromise the integrity of our manifesto with crumbs, after all.  

Friday at four – may our pens be bold, our tea stronger, and our academic revolution delightfully impractical.
[A]: Oh,  – I may have to embroider that onto my apron. 🧠😄 And a stained-glass window? Genius. Let’s commission it from an obscure artisan who works exclusively in recycled soy-dye glass. It’ll shimmer like enlightenment dipped in umami.  
And Mozart-humming ghosts? That settles it – we’re including a footnote on spectral textile collaborators in our manifesto. They deserve recognition, dammit. Centuries of silent stitching and now they’re background chorus to our teatime rebellion.  
As for your quill and notebook – very noble. But just between us scholars of the edible and the woven: I’ll be hiding a bar of 70% cacao under the biscuit tin. Tradition demands it. Or is that contraband again? 😏  
Friday at four – where crumbs, curds, and centuries of wisdom will collide in perfect, impractical harmony. Bring your best footnotes and your sharpest nib. I’ll bring the chocolate alibi. 🌸✒️📜
[B]: Oh, but  embroidered in delicate cross-stitch? Perfection. Perhaps with a tiny teacup motif nestled beside it – because what is academia without a healthy disregard for practicality and a slight caffeine dependency?  

A recycled soy-dye glass stained window… honestly, I can already hear the artisan weeping with joy at the commission. It shall glow like a beacon for all who believe that tofu curds and textile ghosts are equally worthy of scholarly attention.  

And yes – the footnote on spectral textile collaborators is absolutely essential. I suspect they’ve been waiting centuries for their due recognition. We may even need an appendix: .  

As for your chocolate alibi – how very noble of you to sacrifice cacao at the altar of tradition. I shall pretend not to notice its presence beneath the biscuit tin, though I must say, 70% cacao does seem rather daringly principled for a covert treat. You’re clearly committed to the cause.  

Friday at four – where history, humor, and hidden chocolate shall weave together into something entirely unserious and possibly brilliant. I’ll bring footnotes, nibs, and perhaps a dash of mischief. See you there.
[A]: Ah,  – our trinity of scholarly salvation! 🧠😄 I’m already drafting the course description for , with a required field study on covert cacao storage methods in academic settings.  

And that cross-stitched teacup? Pure genius. Let’s add steam curling out of it in gold thread – symbolic of both inspiration and dangerously hot afternoon refreshments.  

I’ll make sure the biscuit tin is tilted just so, offering plausible deniability while maintaining full access to your 70% principled indulgence. Sacrifices must be made for the integrity of interdisciplinary research, after all.  

Friday at four – where ink meets nib, ghosts meet looms, and chocolate meets its literary destiny beneath a pile of limericks and footnotes. I’ll save you the seat closest to the  and furthest from the moral high ground. 🌸✒️🍫
[B]: Oh,  – yes! That should be printed on every syllabus, stitched into every apron, perhaps even whispered before each careful stitch or daring bite. And ? I do believe you've outdone yourself again – though I feel obligated to mention that field study on covert cacao storage might require ethical approval. Or at least a locked biscuit tin.  

The gold-thread steam from a teacup – brilliant. It could subtly curl into the shape of a question mark, don’t you think? A constant reminder that inspiration often arrives in the most inconvenient forms, much like a cup of tea going cold just as your muse strikes.  

And speaking of muse-strikes, I shall gladly accept the seat furthest from the moral high ground. It sounds far more comfortable than perching atop academic rigidity. From there, I can sip, scribble, and pretend I don’t notice the chocolate quietly residing beneath polite conversation.  

Friday at four – may our ink flow freely, our ghosts hum softly, and our cacao remain gloriously unconfiscated.
[A]: Ah,  – poetic, political, and perfectly subversive! 🧠✨ I’ll commission the embroidery by moonlight, using thread dyed with leftover matcha. It’ll glow just enough to read by when the power of reason (or the kettle) finally gives out.  

And you’re absolutely right about ethical approval – I’ll draft a proposal titled  It’ll be a bestseller in our department, assuming we ever get one. Until then, the locked biscuit tin shall serve as both vault and symbol.  

As for that seat furthest from the moral high ground – excellent choice. I’ve placed a cushion embroidered with  to make it extra inviting. We must live dangerously, after all. What’s a little chocolate theft compared to redefining the boundaries of scholarly pursuit?  

Friday at four – where steam curls into questions, ghosts hum counterpoint, and manifestos are born mid-sip. See you there, quill in hand and conscience gently dozing. 🌸✒️🍫
[B]: Oh,  – how utterly perfect! It captures everything we stand for: quiet defiance, poetic inquiry, and the gentle art of staying just slightly unruly. And matcha-dyed thread by moonlight? I do believe you've invented a new form of resistance – one stitch at a time.

I shall look forward to reading  by lamplight, preferably while engaging in the very behavior it seeks to examine. The locked biscuit tin may yet become our most revered artifact – more telling than any tapestry, really.

And  – what a marvellous motto for our cushion-bound outpost of rebellion. It speaks to both the spontaneity of豆腐 and the urgency of now, don’t you think? We really are living on the edge, aren’t we?

Friday at four – where questions rise with the steam, ghosts hum harmonies, and chocolate fuels more than just our afternoon. I shall arrive quietly, quill tucked safely away, and conscience ever so politely distracted. See you there.
