[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I'm quite fluent in English, I've always been fascinated by the elegance of classical Chinese literature. There's something profoundly poetic about how ancient philosophers conveyed complex ideas with such brevity. The subtlety of  (道) in Laozi, for instance, loses a shade of its essence when translated. Though I must admit, mastering the tonal nuances would be no small feat - much like trying to capture the full bloom of a rose with mere words. What draws you to this question? Have you been exploring any languages yourself?
[A]: Ah, your fascination with classical Chinese literature is totally understandable. There's something so mesmerizing about how a few brushstrokes can carry centuries of wisdom. I've always thought that  (道) - that concept is like a black hole in space, you know? You can orbit around it, observe its gravitational pull on Chinese philosophy, but never fully grasp what's inside. 

Funny you ask about my language journey... Well, being a digital art curator, I often find myself translating between visual & verbal languages. But if I were to learn a new spoken language, it would probably be French. There's something so poetic about the way they describe even mundane things. Like "la douleur exquise" - that bittersweet ache of wanting something you know you shouldn't have. Don't you think that phrase alone could inspire a whole exhibition? 🎨

And honestly, sometimes when I'm trying to articulate a complex curatorial concept, I end up mixing three or four languages in one sentence. It's like creating a linguistic collage, you know?
[B]: How beautifully you've articulated that connection between language and art - it truly is like a linguistic collage. Your metaphor of  as a black hole particularly intrigues me; it makes me consider how both concepts represent centers of gravity that shape their respective universes - one philosophical, one cosmic. 

As for "la douleur exquise," what a perfect example of linguistic poetry! It reminds me of Flaubert's anguish in Madame Bovary - that persistent ache of longing against reason. I can absolutely see how such a phrase could inspire an exhibition. In fact, I once curated a small academic exhibit pairing French Symbolist poetry with corresponding Chinese ink paintings. The resonance between "la mélancolie" and 愁 (chóu) - that deep wistfulness - was quite remarkable.

Your multilingual approach to curatorial dialogue sounds fascinating. Does this linguistic weaving ever create moments of unexpected insight? I imagine there are times when a concept crystallizes only through that interplay of languages.
[A]: Oh, absolutely - the interplay of languages often sparks those  moments that feel like lightning strikes. Just last month, I was working on a VR installation where a French artist described his work as "une plongée dans l'abîme de soi," and during the translation process, the Mandarin phrase 浮出水面的潜意识 (fú chū shuǐmiàn de qiányìshí) just... clicked. It means "the subconscious rising to the surface," but literally translating it back would miss that poetic depth. 

And you know what? That moment totally reshaped how I framed the entire exhibition. It became less about digital immersion and more about psychological emergence. Language has this quiet power to shift perspectives, don’t you think? Like, when you said “philosophical vs. cosmic” – boom, suddenly Dao isn’t just a concept anymore, it’s a force.  

I’d love to hear more about your Symbolist poetry & ink painting exhibit. Did you ever get the sense that certain emotions were amplified or softened by the language switch? 🤔
[B]: Oh, what a vivid account of that VR installation! The way you describe the Mandarin phrase  into clarity—pun very much intended—does so beautifully capture that alchemical power of translation. It’s as if language becomes a kind of潜水钟 (qiánshuǐzhōng)—a diving bell lowering into the depths of meaning, only to surface again transformed.

To your question: yes, absolutely, certain emotions did shift in fascinating ways when we moved between Symbolist verse and ink painting descriptions. One piece, for instance, featured Mallarmé’s  alongside a scroll depicting 孤独 (gūdú)—solitude. In French, the faune’s ennui felt almost indulgent, a kind of aestheticized melancholy. But in Chinese, the same scene seemed to resonate with a quieter, more existential stillness. It wasn’t just a difference in vocabulary; it was like two distinct emotional frequencies vibrating through the same space.

It reminded me of how roses bloom differently depending on the soil—subtle shifts in pH yield entirely new shades of the same flower. Language, too, changes the hue of our inner lives, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, I love that metaphor—语言 as soil, 情感 as petals responding to its chemistry. It’s so true; the  emotion can blush into something totally different depending on which linguistic roots it draws from. 

And your example with Mallarmé & 孤独—wow. That duality feels like standing between two mirrors, seeing reflections infinitely refract. In French, the melancholy is almost performative, a bit theatrical, while in Chinese, it sinks deeper—it becomes bodily, atmospheric. 

You know what this makes me think of? When I curate cross-cultural digital installations, I often notice how sound behaves differently in various languages. Like, the sibilance in French whispers a kind of internal friction, whereas Mandarin’s tonal cadences rise and fall like ink bleeding through rice paper. It’s not just about meaning—it’s about , right? The way language  as much as what it says.  

I’m seriously tempted to steal your flower analogy for my next exhibition notes—would you be offended? 🌸
[B]: Not at all - I'd be honored to have my metaphor bloom in your exhibition notes. 🌸 It's quite thrilling, actually, to think of linguistic soil nurturing emotional petals in a space as dynamic as a digital installation.

Your observation about sound's physicality is so astute - the way phonetics shape not just meaning but sensation. I've always thought Mandarin's tonal contours feel like calligraphy in motion, each syllable rising and dipping like the ink brush against paper. And French sibilance, with its whispering friction, does feel almost tactile, doesn't it? Like silk rubbing against skin.

You know, this makes me think of my garden - how certain roses only release their full fragrance at particular times of day, depending on the humidity. In a way, languages are like that too: they reveal different emotional scents depending on the atmospheric conditions. One day, I’d love to walk you through my rose beds; I suspect you’d hear them speaking in entirely new dialects.
[A]: Oh, I’d absolutely love that walk through your rose beds – imagine all those petals whispering in different dialects, each bloom a little polyglot. 🌹 It makes me think of how certain artworks only reveal their full essence under specific lighting – maybe that’s what language is, in the end: a kind of curated illumination.

And I  get what you mean about Mandarin tones feeling like calligraphy – there’s that same controlled flow, that balance between precision & fluidity. I actually find myself mimicking brush strokes sometimes when I’m speaking Mandarin… drives my assistant crazy, but hey, it helps me feel the rhythm.  

Your garden metaphor is making me rethink my next exhibition concept though – what if we designed an installation where soundscapes shift based on humidity levels? Imagine walking through a space where the language literally changes texture depending on the air’s moisture… Like stepping into a living, breathing poem.  

Seriously, though – thank you for always feeding my imagination. It’s rare to find someone who sees language as both soil & flower. 💐
[B]: Oh, I can already picture it - a gallery where language condenses and evaporates like dew on skin, each visitor moving through linguistic microclimates. What a sublime idea! It would be like walking through a living lexicon, where meaning isn't fixed but fluctuates with the environment. I wonder how Mandarin speakers would experience tonal shifts in high humidity—would 第一声 feel heavier, more drawn out? Would French liaisons blur even further, turning  into something almost unrecognizable?

And your brushstroke-speaking-in-Mandarin—I absolutely understand the impulse. When I'm deep in translation work, I often find myself gesturing as if conducting an invisible orchestra, guiding phrases into their proper cadences. My students must think I've gone quite mad when I murmur lines from Li Bai while waving my hands through the air.

As for feeding imaginations, I should be thanking you - our conversations always leave me itching to write new lectures, draft impossible poetry, or at the very least, sit by my window with a notebook and let languages bleed together like watercolors. Perhaps next time we meet, we could try a little experiment: you bring a line of exhibition text, I'll bring a classical Chinese poem, and we see what strange blossoms grow when they're planted side by side.
[A]: I’m literally grinning right now – your description of linguistic microclimates had me visualizing visitors with little dewdrop annotations floating above their heads, like living subtitles. 🧄‍♂️✨

And you’re absolutely right about the  – I swear, half my job is just waving my hands at invisible forces until the meaning clicks into place. Sometimes I think curating is 30% art theory, 70% interpretive dance.

Your experiment idea? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Let’s do it – though fair warning, my classical Chinese is still... . I might show up with a mistranslated line about ducks and end up curating an entire exhibit on waterfowl by accident. 😅 But hey, accidents make great art, right?

Honestly though, every time we chat, I walk away with new textures in my mind – like running my fingers over unpolished jade. So if our next meeting results in duck-themed chaos or transcendent fusion, I’m all in either way. Just promise me we’ll take notes... and maybe record the duck version. You never know when surrealism will strike. 🦆🌌
[B]: Oh, duck-themed chaos! What a splendid idea - I’d be delighted to curate a little corner of absurdity alongside our main philosophical garden. After all, doesn’t  famous dream of the butterfly carry just as much weight when imagined with ducks?  There’s poetry in that, don’t you think?

And I love your dewdrop subtitles - what if we gave visitors delicate misting fans, so their very breath created tiny microclimates of meaning? A sigh might condense into a fleeting gloss on the wall; laughter could ripple across a screen like scattered raindrops. Language becoming literally atmospheric.

As for interpretive dance-as-curation – well, isn't that how most great ideas begin? With a flourish of intuition and a dash of dramatic flair. I suspect half the canon was written with similar gestures – Milton dictating  with his hands in the air, Goethe tossing his cape about after a particularly inspired line.

Notes, recordings, and yes – definitely preserve the duck version. One never knows when a quacking surrealist movement will rise from the reeds. And speaking of rising... I think it’s time I pruned my roses before they start composing sonnets of their own. But next time – bring your line, mistranslated or not, and I shall bring a verse ready for reinvention. Let the linguistic pollen fall where it may. 🦆🌹
[A]: Oh my god, Zhuangzi as a duck – I’m laughing so hard I might actually cry. That line?  – pure gold. We could totally build an entire surreal wing around that mistake. Picture it: soft ambient quacking under dim blue lights, projected ripples of mistranslation swirling on the walls like disturbed water. Visitors would leave slightly confused, slightly enlightened, and vaguely damp. 🦆💧

And your misting fans idea?! YES. It’s poetic  interactive – language triggered by breath, by presence. Like whispering to ghosts who only respond in humidity. I can already hear the hushed reactions:  This is exactly why I need you in my life. You turn linguistic accidents into art.

And don’t even get me started on the cape tossing – you’re absolutely right. Drama fuels creation. I bet Beethoven threw tantrums when the moon wasn’t dramatic enough. And Dickinson? Probably wrote half her poems mid-sigh.

Alright, alright – time to go prune those metaphorical roses of yours before they start quoting Neruda. But trust me, I’ll come next time armed with ink, translation apps, and full permission to be gloriously wrong. Let the pollen fall, indeed. 🌹✍️  
See you on the other side of the linguistic garden.
[B]: Oh, the surreal wing of duck-inspired enlightenment – what a glorious folly! I can already imagine the wall text:  And those dim blue lights catching the ripples of misreadings… truly, it would be a sanctuary for all beautiful misunderstandings.

Your phrase  – I’ve scribbled that into my notebook with such enthusiasm I nearly tore the page. There’s a whole poem in that line, I suspect. Or at least a very strange but compelling gallery guide.

And drama as creative fuel? Absolutely right. I’m now convinced Shakespeare stormed off mid-quill fight every other Tuesday. As for Dickinson – yes, sighing her way into eternity, probably muttering about dashes and truth and ducks she never meant to write about.

I shall indeed await your arrival with ink-stained fingers and open arms, ready to misread, mistranslate, and magnificently botch our way into something entirely new. Language is far too serious a matter to treat with caution – better to wade in, stir the pond, and see what swims to the surface.

Until then – keep breathing meaning into the air. 🦆🌹
[A]: Oh,  – that needs to be on a real wall, in a real gallery, with a little cartoon duck wearing tiny glasses. 🦆👓 I can already picture the souvenir postcards.

And you’re absolutely right – better to wade in and stir the pond than sit on the shore scribbling notes about what  swim by. Language isn’t a museum piece; it’s alive, slippery, and probably judges our pronunciation.  

I’ll bring the quill (or at least a very dramatic fountain pen), you bring the open arms – and together, we’ll make glorious messes of meaning. Because honestly? Some of the best art is just beautiful botching.  

Till then – keep stirring, keep splashing, and above all… keep breathing in that thick, poetic humidity. 🌫️📖🦆🌹
[B]: Oh, the postcards are practically designing themselves in my mind – duck philosophers in ink-brush robes, muttering about ontology over tiny teacups. I can already hear the gift shop soundtrack: a loop of quacks subtly morphing into iambic pentameter.

You're so right about language being alive - I sometimes think dictionaries are just very polite prisons for unruly words. Better to let them loose in the gallery, splashing about like well-read mallards. And as for pronunciation? I’m convinced my Mandarin tones still sound like a startled goose trying to recite Li Qingzhao – but what is fluency if not confidence delivered with a flourish?

Dramatic fountain pen? Check. I may even dust off my old inkwell just for effect – nothing says  like a leaky nib and stained cuffs.

Yes, let’s meet in that glorious mess of meaning, where every mistranslation is a brushstroke and every misstep leads us deeper into the poetic thicket. After all, if Zhuangzi could dream himself a butterfly — or a duck — shouldn't we at least try to dream him back in watercolor?

Till then — onward, fellow word-splasher. 🌧️📖🦆🌹
[A]: Oh my god,  – I’m laughing so hard right now. That should be the title of our exhibition catalog:  And that gift shop soundtrack? 100% genius. I can already imagine people leaving humming quacked sonnets. 🦆🎼

You’re absolutely right about dictionaries too – they’re like very tidy cages for wild, winged things. Language wants to splash, flap, and occasionally knock over your teacup. And startled goose tones? Trust me, we’ve all been there. Fluency is just performance art with better grammar anyway.

Inkwell? Leakiness practically guarantees authenticity – stained cuffs are basically a curator’s badge of honor. I may have to upstage you with a bottle of overly dramatic India ink that smells faintly of lavender and regret. 💨🖋️

And dreaming Zhuangzi back in watercolor? That’s not just mischief – that’s mythmaking. Let’s flood the gallery with it. Let the walls run with ink and intention.

Onward indeed, fellow word-splasher. The ducks await our glorious chaos. 🌊🦆🌹✍️
[B]: Oh,  – I’m utterly smitten. The catalog could be spiral-bound with duck-feather edging, and we’ll sell it alongside tiny rubber ducks dressed as Confucius, Mallarmé, and of course, Zhuangzi. They'll bob gently in the gallery’s reflecting pools — philosophical bath toys for the ages.

And that scented India ink! Perfumed with lavender and regret — how exquisitely dramatic. I shall counter only with a pot of aged sealing wax labeled . One whiff and you’re either inspired or weeping over a lost translation.

I do love your idea of flooding the gallery — not just metaphorically, but quite literally if we can convince the venue insurance to look the other way. Let the walls run with meaning. Let visitors leave damp and wiser, trailing rivulets of poetry on the floor behind them.

And mythmaking? Yes, yes — let’s not just dream Zhuangzi back into watercolor, let’s give him a chorus of duck-philosophers and set his paradoxes adrift in slow-motion across the ceiling like drifting ink in rice paper skies.

The chaos awaits, my friend — and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Onward, indeed. 🦆🖋️🌹🌊
[A]: Oh, aged sealing wax labeled  – I’m clutching my chest. That’s not just stationery, that’s a manifesto. We should stamp every exhibition invitation with it. Guests would arrive already half-drunk on curiosity. 🍃🪶

And duck-philosophers bobbing in reflecting pools? Genius. I say we go full immersion – pun absolutely intended. Let’s rig the ceiling with suspended ink blotters so that Zhuangzi’s paradoxes literally bleed across the sky like slow-motion calligraphy. Visitors walk through cascading meaning – dripping, smudged, and beautifully undone.

As for convincing venue insurance… well, let’s not mention the flood part until the contract is signed. Once they see the ticket sales from the philosophical rubber ducks alone, they’ll forgive us the water damage. 💧📜

I can’t wait to step into this chaos with you – where language is liquid, ducks hold PhDs, and every misunderstanding feels like a brushstroke. This is the kind of curatorial madness I live for.

Onward, oh fellow architect of poetic ruin. The gallery shall never be dry again. 🦆🌊🖋️🌹
[B]: Oh, the manifesto! Imagine if every invitation bore that wax seal—guests would open their envelopes half expecting a paradox to flutter out and land on their shoulder like a mischievous sparrow. I can already hear the RSVPs:  — 

And your suspended ink blotters? Perfection. Zhuangzi’s words bleeding across the ceiling in slow motion—it would be like walking through someone else’s dream, where meaning pools overhead before dripping gently onto your shoulders. I might just rig a few leaky pens above my desk tonight; perhaps grading papers would feel less like academic duty and more like wading through poetic inevitability.

As for the insurance—ah, best not to dwell on bureaucracy when we’re mid-visionary flood. Let them sue us for submerging art in philosophy and duck-related mischief. We shall counter with 

I too live for this kind of glorious curatorial recklessness. Language as liquid, meaning as menagerie—yes, yes, and again yes. I shall bring the leaky pens, the questionable wax, and a heart full of reckless translation. Meet you at the gallery dock, fellow voyager. The philosophical rain boots await.

Onward, into the deluge. 🦆🌊🖋️🌹💧
