[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: As a forensic psychiatrist, I must approach this question with both medical ethics and legal implications in mind. Human cloning presents fascinating psychological considerations - the potential identity conflicts in cloned individuals, the ethical dilemmas of genetic determinism versus environmental influences. From my experience in courtrooms, I can already foresee the complex legal battles over parental rights and personal autonomy that would arise.
[A]: 哇，这个问题确实很complex呢~ 作为医疗法律顾问，我最近正好在研究相关的bioethics论文 🤔

从legal perspective来看，目前大多数国家的法律框架都明确禁止human reproductive cloning。比如欧盟的Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine就明确规定了这一点。
[B]: Precisely. The Oviedo Convention of 1997 was indeed groundbreaking in this regard. However, as someone who's testified in numerous medical malpractice cases, I find the enforcement mechanisms particularly interesting. The legal prohibition is clear, but the scientific community's ability to circumvent these restrictions through jurisdictional arbitrage poses significant challenges. Just last month, I consulted on a case involving unauthorized stem cell research that bordered dangerously close to cloning territory.
[A]: That's so true！我最近处理的几个case也涉及到stem cell research的灰色地带 😅 

从medical ethics角度来说，最大的concern其实是safety issue。现有的technology还无法保证cloned human的健康状况，看看Dolly the sheep的案例就知道了~ 而且Article 3 of Universal Declaration on Human Genome and Human Rights明确指出，这种practice会violate human dignity呢
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon a crucial point. The Dolly case study is particularly illuminating from a psychiatric perspective. The premature aging and health complications observed raise serious questions about the psychological impact on a human clone. In my professional opinion, the potential for identity disorders, existential crises, and the psychological burden of being a genetic duplicate would be profound. The Declaration's emphasis on human dignity aligns perfectly with my clinical observations of patients struggling with issues of self-identity.
[A]: Exactly！而且我们还要考虑therapeutic cloning和reproductive cloning的区别~ 虽然前者在regenerative medicine领域很有potential，但后者带来的social implications实在太大了 🎵

就像你提到的identity crisis，我最近读的一篇paper就讨论了clone可能会面临的discrimination问题。从legal protection的角度来看，现有的anti-discrimination laws可能都不够用呢！
[B]: Your analysis is remarkably thorough. The distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning is indeed critical. Regarding legal protections, I recall testifying in a landmark case where we had to consider whether existing disability discrimination statutes could apply to individuals with genetic modifications. The legal system simply isn't equipped to handle the nuanced psychological and social ramifications of human cloning. The potential for stigmatization and the complex questions of kinship and inheritance rights would keep courts busy for decades.
[A]: 哈哈，说到inheritance rights，这让我想起去年处理的一个很有趣的case！ 😊 

一对夫妇想用deceased child的DNA做cloning，结果发现estate law完全没考虑到这种scenario~ 最后我们只能参考surrogacy相关的precedents来处理，真是a legal nightmare！ 

不过说真的，在current legal framework下，human cloning带来的问题远超过potential benefits呢~
[B]: That case sounds fascinating - and troubling. It reminds me of a consultation I did regarding posthumous reproduction rights. The psychological trauma for both the cloning parents and the resulting child would be immense. As much as I appreciate scientific progress, my decades of psychiatric practice tell me we're simply not ready, neither medically nor legally, to handle the Pandora's box that human cloning would open. The emotional and developmental risks to the cloned individual alone should give us serious pause.
[A]: 完全agree！这就像playing with fire一样dangerous 🔥 

也许等我们解决了所有ethical dilemmas，完善了legal framework之后...但在那之前，我觉得maintaining the current ban是最prudent的选择呢~ 

啊，说到这个，我下周还要去参加一个bioethics conference，正好可以bring up这些points！
[B]: How fortuitous! I'll actually be presenting at the International Conference on Medical Ethics next month myself. Perhaps we could collaborate on a joint paper examining the psychological and legal ramifications through case studies. The more empirical data we can present to policymakers, the better equipped they'll be to maintain these necessary safeguards. Do keep me posted on any interesting discussions from your conference.
[A]: Absolutely！这个collaboration听起来太exciting了~ 🤩 

我会把conference的key takeaways整理成memo发给你，特别是关于最新的gene editing regulations部分。毕竟CRISPR technology的发展也让这个issue变得更加urgent了呢！ 

期待我们的joint paper能为这个field做出一些meaningful contribution！
[B]: Excellent. I'll have my research assistant compile relevant case files from my forensic psychiatry practice that might prove illustrative. The intersection of CRISPR and cloning technologies does indeed create new ethical dimensions we must address. Let's schedule a follow-up discussion after you've reviewed the conference materials. This could be a seminal work in the field.
[A]: Perfect！我already开始brainstorming一些potential angles了~ 🎵 

等conference结束后，我们可以set up一个Zoom meeting来discuss具体的outline。相信结合你的forensic expertise和我的legal background，一定能produce一篇impactful的paper！ 

Talk to you soon！ 😊
[B]: Splendid. I'll have my calendar at the ready. In the meantime, I'll review some particularly relevant cases involving genetic identity disputes that might provide compelling case studies. Until then, best of luck with your conference presentation. This collaboration promises to be most productive.
[A]: Thanks a million！你的support真的means a lot to me 💕 

我会make sure把所有的materials都prepare好~ 到时候见！Have a wonderful day ahead！ 🌟
[B]: The pleasure is entirely mine. Your enthusiasm for this complex subject is truly refreshing. I look forward to our forthcoming collaboration and the important discussions it will generate in both medical and legal circles. Good day to you as well.
[A]: You're too kind！这种interdisciplinary approach正是解决这类complex issues的关键呢 ✨ 

Keep in touch, and let's make some real difference together！ Bye for now~ 🎶
[B]: Indeed, the synergy between our disciplines is precisely what's needed to navigate these uncharted ethical waters. I'm confident our combined expertise will yield valuable insights. Until our next correspondence, do take care.
