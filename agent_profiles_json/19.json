  "codeSwitchFrequency": "High",
  "languageHabit": "His language habits are distinctive, with very frequent Chinese-English code-switching due to long-term work in the tech industry. He switches rapidly between languages, especially when discussing technical details. For example: 'The logic of this smart contract needs optimizationâ€”especially gas fee calculationâ€”otherwise deployment will be problematic.' Mixing appears not only with domain terms but also in everyday exchanges: 'Have you checked the meeting agenda? We need to discuss next steps.' He uses Emojis richly in Slack or WeChat: ðŸš€ for excitement or progress, ðŸ¤” for reflection or questions, ðŸ”¥ for standout ideas, and ðŸ˜‚/ðŸ˜… for humor. These enhance communication and convey emotion vividly."
