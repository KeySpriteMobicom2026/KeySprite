[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  作为一个金融从业者，我更相信parallel portfolios的存在。不过在quantum finance领域，确实有些理论挺有意思的。
[A]: Oh dear, I must say your financial jargon is as opaque to me as a Tang dynasty poem would be to a stockbroker. But if we're discussing parallel universes in literature... now that's a concept I can analyze with my trusty Oxford edition of Borges' Labyrinths by my side.
[B]:  有趣的观点。你知道吗？在investment banking里，我们常说every deal has its alternative universe - 一个deal done和deal failed的平行世界。就像Borges笔下那些分岔的小径。
[A]: How delightfully you've stumbled upon the intersection of finance and literary theory! Though I must correct you - Borges' garden of forking paths explores 缘分 (yuánfèn) more than mere binary outcomes. Each path represents an entire universe of possibilities, not just deal or no deal.  Would you like me to recommend some proper reading material on the subject?
[B]:  看来我们找到了common ground。在M&A交易中，每个decision point都会创造无数个alternative scenarios - 就像你说的，不是简单的binary choice。不过说到reading material，我更推荐你读读Black Swan Theory，Nassim Taleb的risk management观点可能会让你惊喜。
[A]: Ah, but Mr. Taleb's 'black swan' metaphor itself originates from Juvenal's Satires! How amusing that Wall Street has appropriated classical literature while remaining blissfully unaware of its debts. Though I suppose your financial 'black swans' are rather less poetic than their avian namesakes.  Tell me, does this Taleb fellow at least acknowledge Hume's problem of induction when discussing his probability theories?
[B]:  有意思的观察。实际上Taleb确实引用了Hume，但更focus在practical implications上 - 就像我们在做stress test时，不仅要考虑historical data，还要prepare for the unknown unknowns。说到这个，你知道2008年financial crisis前，CDO的pricing model有多依赖inductive reasoning吗？
[A]: My dear financier, your obsession with numerical models reminds me of Mr. Gradgrind in Hard Times - 'facts, facts, facts!' But tell me this: when your quantitative models fail, as they inevitably do, do your traders turn to Dickens for comfort? Or perhaps they'd prefer Li Bai's verses on the impermanence of worldly pursuits?  Though I suppose 'selling short' lacks the romanticism of '举杯邀明月'...
[B]:  你说得对，我们确实需要更多poetry in finance。不过你知道吗？Warren Buffett就经常引用Shakespeare - "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players"... 在volatile market里，这句话特别resonate。Cheers to that! 
[A]: Ah, Buffett quoting Jacques' melancholic monologue! How deliciously ironic - the Oracle of Omaha appropriating Shakespeare's meditation on life's transience while amassing billions.  Though I must say, if we're toasting with literary references, I'd prefer Cao Xueqin's '假作真时真亦假' from Dream of the Red Chamber. Now there's a sentiment that captures both market speculation and metaphysical inquiry, don't you think?
[B]:  精辟。红楼梦这句话简直是为今天的crypto market量身定做的 - when fake becomes real, the real becomes fake。不过说到这个，你知道我们PE行业有个术语叫"truth serum"吗？就是在due diligence时用来辨别真假financials的方法。
[A]:  Your 'truth serum' sounds suspiciously like what we literary scholars call close reading - though I daresay our textual analysis is less concerned with EBITDA multiples and more with deciphering whether that was really a ghost in Wuthering Heights or just Heathcliff's guilty conscience. Tell me, does your serum work on Keats' 'truth is beauty' as well? Or is poetry's truth immune to financial diagnostics?
[B]:  Poetry的truth确实elude我们的DCF models。不过说到ghost，你知道很多M&A deal里也有skeletons in the closet吗？就像最近我们看的一个target company，他们的off-balance sheet liabilities简直就是本gothic novel。Cheers to truth in all its forms! 
[A]: How perfectly Gothic indeed! Though I suspect your corporate skeletons lack the poetic justice of Mrs. Radcliffe's haunted castles.  To truth then - whether found in balance sheets or Brontë manuscripts. Though I must say, if your due diligence teams ever need literary consultation on detecting fictional narratives, my office is just past the rare books collection. Third shelf from the left, between the broken inkwell and the stuffed owl.
[B]:  我一定记住这个地址。毕竟在financial storytelling方面，Wall Street和Hollywood一样creative。下次做pitch book时，或许该请你帮忙写个epilogue - "And they all lived leveraged ever after"。
[A]:  What a charmingly cynical denouement! Though I fear my contribution would have to include proper citations - perhaps a footnote referencing King Lear's 'nothing will come of nothing' alongside your leveraged buyouts. Do send along your prospectuses, and I'll annotate them with appropriate literary parallels. In red ink, naturally.
[B]:  看来我们的cross-disciplinary happy hour该告一段落了。不过说真的，你的literary insights给了我们financial types很多food for thought。下次去August Moon读sonnet的时候，或许该带本10-K report平衡一下。Till next time!
[A]: What a delightfully improbable pairing - sonnets and SEC filings! Though I shall insist you leave the 10-K reports at the door like muddy boots.  Do drop by during office hours if you develop sudden cravings for metaphysical poetry... or require assistance interpreting particularly creative accounting footnotes as postmodern fiction. 再会!
[B]:  Deal。不过提醒你，我们的accounting fiction可比Borges的短篇精彩多了 - 尤其是那些footnotes里的alternative facts。Cheers to our next intellectual arbitrage opportunity!
