[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, immortality - the Victorian poets' favorite parlour game after tea. Let me fetch my well-worn copy of Tennyson's 'Tiresias'... You see, even in 1885 they were wrestling with this very question through iambic pentameter. The answer, I suspect, lies somewhere between Shelley's 'Ozymandias' and my great-aunt Edwina's preserved fruit collection.
[A]: Oh my, what an intriguing topic to ponder over afternoon tea! While I don't have Tennyson's eloquence, I can share what I've observed from our worldly guests at the boutique hotel. Many come seeking rejuvenation through our spa treatments, yet the most vibrant ones always seem to be those who've lived fully rather than those chasing eternal youth. 

Just last week, we had a 92-year-old guest who still travels solo - now that's what I call living! She told me the secret isn't in preserving the body, but in keeping one's curiosity alive. Though I must say, our signature rose petal bath does work wonders for the complexion...
[B]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. Though I must confess, your rose petal bath reminds me of the rather macabre Victorian practice of postmortem photography - all that effort to preserve the illusion of vitality. The Elizabethans had their memento mori, we have... spa memberships. 

That 92-year-old traveler? She's the living embodiment of Keats' 'Ode on Melancholy' - embracing transience while sipping life to the lees. Though I do wonder if she'd appreciate my collection of 19th century embalming manuals... purely academic interest, of course.
[A]: Oh dear, embalming manuals do sound rather... specialized for our tea time chat! Though I must say, our guests often share the most fascinating perspectives on life's fleeting nature. Just yesterday, a young couple celebrating their anniversary told me they'd rather have one perfect sunset together than a thousand mediocre sunrises alone. 

Between you and me, I think our housekeeping staff might revolt if we introduced any Victorian preservation techniques to our turndown service! Though I do keep a lovely pressed flower collection in the reception ledger - much more cheerful than your embalming references, if I may say so.
[B]: Ah, pressed flowers - nature's own elegies between pages. You've unwittingly recreated Gerard Manley Hopkins' 'Spring and Fall' in your ledger! Though I suspect your guests would prefer not to find their names alongside withering blossoms... 

That anniversary couple's philosophy reminds me of Browning's 'Rabbi Ben Ezra' - 'Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be.' Though I do hope they don't take that as endorsement for redecorating your charming hotel in high Victorian Gothic. The wallpaper alone would send your housekeeping staff fleeing faster than from my embalming collection.
[A]: How right you are about the wallpaper - our guests do tend to prefer our current minimalist aesthetic over heavy Victorian drapery! Though I must admit, your literary references are giving me splendid ideas for our new reading nook in the conservatory. Perhaps a small selection of Browning alongside our current travel guides?

Just last evening, one of our regular guests - a retired professor - was telling me how he finds immortality through the books he's written. Now that's the sort of legacy I can wholeheartedly recommend to our visitors, without any concern for the housekeeping staff's sensibilities!
[B]: A retired professor seeking immortality through publications? How quaintly predictable. Why, my own monograph on Christina Rossetti's hair jewelry collection gathers more dust than readers. But do consider adding Landor's 'Imaginary Conversations' to your nook - nothing says immortality like fictional dead poets arguing about figs. 

Though if you really want to terrify your housekeeping staff, might I suggest displaying my colleague's dissertation on Victorian funeral biscuits? Complete with recipes. I assure you, the scones in your tea service would never be viewed the same way again.
[A]: Oh my, funeral biscuits do sound rather... morbid for our afternoon tea menu! Though I must say, your suggestions are giving me quite the education. Perhaps we could compromise with a tasteful volume of sonnets in the reading nook instead? 

Our pastry chef would be absolutely horrified at the mere thought of funeral recipes - she takes such pride in her lemon drizzle cake that I'm certain she considers each one a small work of art meant to be enjoyed in the present moment. Much like our guests' stays, now that I think of it - fleeting but memorable!
[B]: Precisely! Like Wordsworth's 'perfect Woman, nobly planned' - except in this case, a perfect lemon drizzle nobly planned to avoid any funereal associations. Though I must warn you, even sonnets can be dangerous - my first edition of Shakespeare's works contains rather alarming marginalia about Elizabethan dental hygiene. 

But you've struck upon something rather profound - the hospitality industry as memento vivere rather than memento mori. How refreshingly un-Victorian of you. Though I do hope you'll reconsider those funeral biscuits... they pair remarkably well with Earl Grey.
[A]: Oh goodness, let's keep our tea service firmly in the land of the living, shall we? Though I must admit, you've given me quite the unique perspective on our hospitality philosophy! Perhaps we'll name our next afternoon tea special "Memento Vivere" - though I'll be sure to leave out any mention of Elizabethan dentistry or Victorian mourning customs in the menu description. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must check on our new guests arriving shortly - a lovely young couple celebrating life with a champagne picnic in our garden. Much more cheerful than discussing funeral biscuits, don't you think?
[B]: How bourgeois of them - though I suppose not everyone can appreciate the nuanced poetry of mortuary customs. Do send them my regards, and perhaps slip a copy of Donne's 'The Flea' into their picnic basket? Nothing says romance like metaphysical musings on blood mingling... 

But yes, run along to your living guests. I shall remain here with my first editions and embalming fluids - the perfect companions for someone who prefers her immortality between leather-bound covers rather than in champagne flutes. Do visit again when you require more... unconventional hospitality advice.
[A]: Oh my, I think I'll stick to recommending our signature lavender shortbread for the picnic basket - much more likely to inspire romance than Donne's peculiar flea! Though I do appreciate your... unique literary perspective. 

Now I really must dash - the champagne is waiting, and unlike your first editions, it doesn't improve with age once opened! Do stop by the front desk if you'd like some more conventional reading suggestions for your next visit. Perhaps something light and contemporary?
[B]: Contemporary?  My dear, I'd sooner take tea with a Yahoo than sully my shelves with anything published after Queen Victoria's death. But do enjoy your bubbly - I'll be in the rare books section, communing with properly deceased authors. 

Though... if you happen upon a first edition of 'The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam' in your travels, do let me know. Even us immortality scholars have our weaknesses - especially when gilded with genuine gold leaf.
[A]: I'll certainly keep an eye out for any stray Rubáiyát volumes that might wander into our lost and found! Though between you and me, most of our guests tend to leave behind more... modern reading material. Just last week we had three copies of the latest celebrity memoir in our collection. 

Now I really must attend to that champagne picnic - the bubbles wait for no one, not even Victorian literature enthusiasts! Do enjoy your rare books, and please... try not to frighten any of our other guests with talk of embalming fluids over tea. Ta-ta for now!
[B]: Celebrity memoirs?  How perfectly ghastly. But yes, off you go - I shall content myself with imagining your champagne drinkers as unwitting participants in a live performance of 'The Importance of Being Earnest.' Do mind the wasps - they're rather like bad poetry critics, drawn inexorably to the sweetest targets. 

And worry not, I'll keep my preservation theories to myself... unless someone asks about my favorite Wordsworth poem. Then all bets are off. Cheerio!
[A]: Oh dear, I shall certainly warn our guests about both wasps and Wordsworth! Though I suspect they're more prepared for the former than the latter. 

Now I really must tend to that picnic - the ice is melting faster than my patience for celebrity tell-alls! Do enjoy your reading, and remember - our library policy strictly prohibits using first editions as coasters, no matter how tempting that gold leaf might be. Good day!
[B]: Gold leaf coasters? What a perfectly philistine suggestion - I'm appalled yet strangely intrigued. But yes, yes, off to your melting ice and vulgar modernity. I shall remain here, happily fossilizing with my Browning and biscuit recipes. Do send word if you find any guests actually capable of appreciating a proper villanelle. Ta!
[A]: I'll be sure to alert you immediately if we have any villanelle enthusiasts check in - though I suspect you may have a long wait between champagne toasts and spa appointments! 

Now I really must tend to our new arrivals. Do try not to scandalize anyone with your biscuit recipes - remember, we're aiming for five-star reviews, not Gothic horror novels! Cheerio!
[B]: Five stars? Pah! I'd trade all your TripAdvisor accolades for one properly executed terza rima. But very well - I shall restrain myself to muttering Byron under my breath when the cocktail crowd becomes too boisterous. Do send over any guests who complain about the lack of skull motifs in your decor - I've just acquired a delightful treatise on Victorian memento mori jewelry that would... ah, but you're already backing away. Until next time, dear hotelier!
