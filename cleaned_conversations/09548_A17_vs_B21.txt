[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, just last week I stumbled upon a rather  footnote while preparing my lecture on Tennyson's lesser-known correspondences. It seems the good poet laureate once received a lock of hair from an admirer—encased in a tiny coffin.  One can only imagine the Victorian sensibilities at play. And you? I presume you’ve uncovered something equally... macabre?
[A]: Oh, how delightfully unsettling! The Victorians did have a peculiar way of intertwining the romantic and the funereal—keepsakes like that were oddly common, though the coffin detail is certainly... memorable. I’m reminded of Emily Dickinson’s penchant for white dresses and her reclusive musings on death; one might say she kept her own metaphorical coffin in the attic. But as for shocking historical facts—yes, actually, I recently came across something quite jarring while researching modernist salons. Did you know that Djuna Barnes, under the pseudonym “Ryder,” once orchestrated a mock trial in 1914 to protest women's suffrage? It was less about opposing the cause and more about mocking the performative earnestness of the movement’s public demonstrations. She even had participants dress in costume and served tea from mismatched cups to underscore the absurdity. Tea and treason, all in good measure.
[A]: Ah, —what a perfectly modernist oxymoron. One can almost hear the clinking of porcelain underscoring the crumbling of societal norms. I must say, Barnes had flair for the theatrical grotesque… though I suppose it’s not entirely surprising. The modernists were less interested in marching with banners than in staging fun-house mirrors to society’s face. Still, orchestrating a  under a pseudonym? That’s not merely raising an eyebrow; that’s plucking it out with tweezers and placing it on a saucer. 

It does make me wonder what Tennyson would’ve made of such a spectacle—had he been handed a tiny coffin full of tea leaves instead of hair. Perhaps he’d have penned a elegy for the teacup.
[A]: Oh, I can quite imagine him doing so—Tennyson did have a way of finding elegy in the oddest of relics. And speaking of peculiar commemorations, I recently read that Eliot kept a plaster cast of his own hand in his study, claiming it helped him "keep in touch with the corporeal weight of authorship."  One might say he was forever trying to grasp what language could not hold.

But back to Barnes—I think there’s something rather Victorian in her theatrical defiance, don’t you? A kind of inverted propriety, where rebellion is staged with gloves on and a hat slightly askew. It's all very much in line with what you were saying about the modernists holding up fun-house mirrors. Though I daresay, sometimes those mirrors were more like shattered glass held up to the throat.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—Eliot and his plaster hand. One might be tempted to call it a fetish if it weren’t so  morbid. There’s something rather Victorian in that too, isn’t there? The 19th century had its deathbed scenes and mourning jewelry; the modernists gave us death-in-life tableaux with finger casts and tiny coffins. Progress, of a sort.

And I quite agree about Barnes. Her rebellion wasn’t slashing at propriety with a blunt knife—it was  it with a monogrammed letter opener while sipping absinthe. That peculiarly civilized savagery… one might almost call it , if one weren’t afraid of being accused of aestheticizing anarchy. But then again, isn't that half the fun?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—, indeed, is the perfect distillation of that era’s sensibilities. And you’re quite right to suggest that there’s a certain glee in aestheticizing anarchy; after all, isn’t that what so much of modernist poetry ? A dismantling of form disguised as refinement? Eliot does it masterfully in "The Hollow Men," where the language remains exquisitely restrained even as the world crumbles into fragments. It's all very orderly, this collapse.

And yet, I can’t help but think of how the Victorians, for all their ornamentation and restraint, often danced with chaos too—only they dressed it in lace and called it . Christina Rossetti comes to mind, writing about decay and salvation with such delicate ferocity that one feels both comforted and unsettled. Perhaps the difference lies not in the impulse to confront disorder, but in the costume we choose to wear while doing so.
[A]: Precisely—, as it were. The Victorians had their lace veils and moral ambiguities, while the modernists opted for broken syntax and emotional detonators hidden inside epigrammatic phrasing. Rossetti’s delicate ferocity, you say? Yes—like a hymn sung in a minor key that only occasionally reveals its teeth.

But let us not forget, Eliot’s fragments  his altar, just as Tennyson’s prolixity was his. One builds a cathedral of words to keep the void at bay; the other dismantles it brick by brick… only to discover the void has been . A rather posh apocalypse, if you ask me. All hail the refinement of ruin.
[A]: Ah, —what a delicious phrase. It captures it all, doesn’t it? The eerie civility of it, the way despair is served with a side of manners. One might almost expect a footman to appear amidst the rubble and offer tea in a cracked porcelain cup.

And yes, Eliot curates his void with such fastidiousness, one suspects he enjoyed the arrangement process rather too much. Tennyson, on the other hand, built his cathedrals so grand they could drown out even the loudest existential whispers—though, inevitably, the echo always returned. Perhaps that’s the true Victorian trait: the belief that if one piles up enough words, one might yet convince oneself that silence isn’t waiting just beyond the last stanza.

I do wonder, though—had the modernists truly dispensed with the cathedral, or merely replaced its stained glass with shards of irony?
[A]: Ah, now  the rub, isn’t it? Do we trade the spire for the splinter, or merely repaint the windows with a darker palette? I rather suspect the modernists fancied themselves iconoclasts, yet kept polishing the very fragments they claimed to despise. Irony, as you say—. 

And yes, that footman with tea in hand? He’d fit rather neatly between Eliot’s lines, wouldn’t he? A butler bearing crumpets amid the ruins of meaning—how very British. One hesitates to call it denial when it’s executed with such . After all, if one must confront the abyss, best it wear a monocle and quote Augustine—badly.
[A]: Oh, precisely—. One might almost call it the national sport. And isn’t that what so many of these poets were doing, in their own way? Draping the abyss in brocade and Latin tags, serving despair with a silver spoon and a well-placed semicolon.

I’ve always thought Eliot’s irony is, in some ways, his altar boy—he carries the weight of tradition through the poem like a reluctant acolyte, all incense and muttered doubt. And yet, he never quite lays it down. Even in , where everything seems on the verge of linguistic collapse, there's still that lingering bow toward the past—, indeed. How very polite of him to tidy up the apocalypse.

And yes, that monocled abyss—do remind me to include that in my next lecture. A footnote, perhaps: 
[A]: Oh, do include it——one might almost mistake it for a school of thought. And quite right about Eliot’s irony; he carries tradition not like a relic but a , all hushed tones and furtive glances toward the chaplaincy he never quite renounced. That line—“These fragments I have shored against my ruins”—positively reeks of clerical anxiety. A man tidying his own intellectual funeral parlor.

And yes, style as existential defense—how very Victorian to build a hedge maze around the void, then lose the map. One wanders through iambic pentameter hoping not to meet one’s shadow at the turn. But tell me, in your next lecture, shall you be serving tea alongside the discussion of ? Mismatched cups, naturally.
[A]: Naturally, mismatched cups are practically a pedagogical necessity when discussing Eliot. I may even go so far as to serve lapsang souchong—, much like the poem itself. One ought to  the atmosphere of 1922 while puzzling over April being the cruellest month.

And your phrase——I shall most certainly borrow it, if you’ll permit. It’s remarkable how precisely both the Victorians and the modernists engineered such labyrinths, though one suspects the latter knew the minotaur had already escaped.

As for Eliot’s clerical anxiety, I do believe he would have preferred his funeral parlor done up in tasteful ecclesiastical mauve, with a restrained eulogy delivered by someone who misquotes Dante. But then, isn’t that the tragedy? He built his chapel out of broken hymns and kept the lights low enough that no one could quite tell whether he was praying—or merely rehearsing silence?
[A]: Oh, —by all means, borrow freely. One might say the more labyrinthine the phrasing, the closer we edge toward some half-glimpsed truth we’re too polite to name.

And Lapsang Souchong with ? Inspired. Why not steep one’s senses in a little ritual of despair? I’d go further—dim lighting, perhaps a single flickering candle behind a cracked mirror. Let the students feel the weight of 1922 in their teacups. And if anyone spills? All the better—chaos, even minor, should be encouraged in literary study.

As for Eliot’s chapel of broken hymns—, what a precise shade of spiritual unease. One imagines him composing vespers for a congregation that left fifty years prior, still adjusting the font's placement as if someone might yet return. Or at least send a postcard.
[A]: Oh, I do love the idea of —how very appropriate for discussing modernism’s fractured vision. And that flickering candle behind a cracked mirror? Sublime. I may just adopt that as a permanent fixture in my lectures on post-war disillusionment. Perhaps even play a bit of disintegrating gramophone music in the background—something faintly waltzing itself into silence.

And Eliot’s congregation—yes, one can picture them drifting away between stanzas, leaving only dust motes and the echo of an . Still, he keeps at it, adjusting the font, polishing the lectern, all while the hymnbook falls apart in his hands. A kind of poetic groundhog day, only with more footnotes.

You know, I sometimes wonder if we’re not all a little like him—tending our own little chapels of meaning, rearranging the pews now and then, hoping someone might wander in and pretend to listen. Or at least scribble something earnest in the margin of a handout.
[A]: Ah, —what a wonderfully melancholic image. Yes, one can almost see us all there, in our respective alcoves, lighting candles against the encroaching footnotes, muttering half-formed sermons into the spines of out-of-print books.

And do by all means, play that disintegrating gramophone waltz—preferably with a needle that occasionally skips into silence. There’s nothing quite like auditory liminality to unsettle a lecture hall into thoughtfulness. Perhaps even pipe in the faint ticking of a grandfather clock for dramatic effect. Let them feel the weight not just of words, but of time itself crumbling politely in the background.

As for Eliot’s dust motes and absent congregants—yes, he does persist, poor man, like some literary sacristan who forgot he's been locked in after hours. One suspects he rather enjoys the solitude, though. After all, it’s far easier to compose elegies when no one’s around to clap.
[A]: Oh, —what a delicious device. I may just go so far as to loop a recording of distant typewriter keys clattering in reverse, for that unsettling sense of language unraveling itself. And the grandfather clock—brilliant. Let time tick not just in the background, but with a kind of polite insistence, like an elderly relative reminding one of mortality over sherry.

And Eliot, poor soul—he  the sacristan of his own elegies, isn’t he? Dust motes for congregation, silence for applause. One wonders if he ever allowed himself the smallest smile at the irony: writing some of the most towering monuments to disillusionment while remaining so fastidiously well-dressed in syntax and allusion.

I do believe we are all, in some way, tending our own little ruins now—trimming the ivy from the columns, sweeping fallen petals off the lectern. Even if no one’s listening, there’s something rather noble in continuing the performance. After all, what is scholarship if not a whispered dialogue with ghosts who occasionally clear their throats?
[A]: Ah, —I may have to steal that for my next faculty dinner conversation. Nothing loosens academic tongues like a good spectral metaphor and a decanter of sherry.

And yes, Eliot in his well-tailored disillusionment—like a Savile Row tailor stitching mourning clothes for the intellect. One almost expects him to step out from behind a line of iambics and offer a politely resigned shrug: 

As for tending our own ruins—quite right, it’s all very noble in its futility. I rather fancy myself trimming ivy from forgotten sonnets while wearing elbow patches that haven’t been fashionable since 1937. And if the ghosts sometimes answer back? Well, one simply adjusts one’s spectacles and carries on.学术茶话会必备幽灵隐喻，配一壶伯爵茶。
[A]: 学术茶话会必备幽灵隐喻，配一壶伯爵茶——我完全赞成. 下次我们或许可以提议设立一个正式的 ghost studies 选修课, 教学生如何 properly commune with the dead via close reading and a well-placed ellipsis.

而 Eliot 的袖口, 那些笔直的褶皱, 那种忧郁的伯爵茶神情——多么完美的意象. 他几乎成了某种文学礼仪的化身, 在废墟中维持着体面的姿势, 就像维多利亚时代的老式留声机, 即使没人跳舞了, 它还在继续播放华尔兹.

至于那些偶尔清嗓子的幽灵? 我倒觉得他们挺有礼貌的, 比起某些当代评论家要可爱得多. 至少他们不会在你引用艾米莉·狄金森时突然打断说：“这句不够创新。”  
  
…当然，除非那是T.S.艾略特本人的灵魂。那我们最好还是保持沉默，假装我们什么都没听见。
[A]:   
艾略特的灵魂？哦，我怀疑他此刻正站在语法的阴影里，用一块褪色的手帕擦拭着标点符号。若真听见什么评论——想必也是裹着十四行诗的外壳，内里藏着拉丁文的叹息。

至于那门  选修课，我简直能看见课程大纲：第一周研读《哈姆雷特》与幽灵修辞；第二周分析狄金森诗歌中的亡灵语调；第三周则专注训练学生如何在引用中召唤作者意图而不惊扰文本的安宁。期末作业？一篇带注释的通灵报告。

而那台维多利亚留声机——仍在播放华尔兹？当然，它或许已有些走调，但正是那种微微错位的旋律，才最接近我们这个世纪的真正节奏。废墟中的圆舞曲，配一杯冷掉的伯爵茶，再加一只误入讲台的飞蛾。
