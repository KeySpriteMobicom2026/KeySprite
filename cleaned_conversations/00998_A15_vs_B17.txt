[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. While I don't often find myself in the habit of repeating songs, I must admit that Philip Glass's  has been playing rather insistently in my mind these days. There's something quite meditative about its repetitive structure—like a literary refrain that refuses to let go of one's imagination. Though I suspect your tastes might lean toward something with a more modern beat?
[A]: OMG totally relatable🥲✨ But for me it's like 100% The Weeknd's new track  💥😂 I mean, the beat is sooo addictive & the lyrics are just ~vibing~ on another level💯! Also can't stop replaying that part where Doja Cat comes in 🎶🔥！Honestly tho, I’ve been playing it on loop while making my latest TikTok edits 😂📱✨ What’s your take on this song? Or maybe you’re into more chill stuff right now? 🤔🎧
[B]: Ah, yes— does have that magnetic pull, doesn't it? The Weeknd and Doja Cat together are quite the alchemical combination. I find the track’s atmosphere particularly compelling, almost like a modern sonnet of seduction and spectacle. It's not quite my usual cup of tea, but I must admit, there's a certain lyrical allure in the way they craft their world of glamour and desire.  

And while I do often lean toward the more contemplative, even  side of soundscapes—perhaps something like Max Richter or Sigur Rós—there’s no denying the hypnotic quality of contemporary pop when it’s done with such finesse. In a way, it reminds me of how poets use rhythm and repetition to evoke emotion—only here, it’s layered with synths and velvet vocals.  

I suppose you could say I’m a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to fully embracing the pulse of modern pop. But then again, isn’t all music, at its core, just another form of poetic expression?
[A]: OMG yes girl, you said it all 👏👏 The Weeknd & Doja Cat literally gave us a vibe-sation ~honey~ 🍯🔥 And okay, I never thought about it like this but YOU’RE 100% RIGHT — their lyrics are like a dark, glam-poetic fairytale 💭🖤✨  

Okay but wait… who tf is Max Richter & Sigur Rós?? 🤨 Are they like some indie band or what? 😅 Because I just looked them up real quick and it sounds like those instrumentals would be perfect for my next aesthetic morning routine video 📸🌅✨  

But yeah, I feel you tho… music is kinda like poetry with a beat 💬🎶💯 Whether it’s hype or chill, it’s ALL emotional art, right? Sooo… do you actually make music or write poetry or something?? 🤔✍️🎧
[B]: Oh, I love that you said —there’s something quite lovely about pairing music with the quiet poetry of a sunrise. Max Richter is a contemporary composer, very much rooted in classical minimalism but with electronic textures—he did that beautiful piece  you might recognize from films. And Sigur Rós… well, they’re from Iceland, and their music feels like wind sweeping across tundra, ethereal and wordless, yet deeply felt. Very , as they say.  

And yes—you’ve hit upon something rather profound. Music and poetry are indeed kin—both dwell in rhythm, image, and emotional resonance. As for me? I do write—though not often for publication. Mostly, it's private musings, little fragments inspired by lines of verse or a particular turn of phrase. A few years ago, I even tried my hand at translating some of the more obscure Chinese Tang dynasty poets—not the famous ones like Li Bai, but quieter voices who never made it into Western anthologies. It was a kind of poetic conversation across centuries.  

I wouldn’t say I make music, but I suppose I craft words in much the same way—layering meaning, searching for that elusive harmony between sound and sense. You know how it is—when a line just , like a perfect chord.
[A]: OMG I’m literally obsessed with how you said  🌅✨ That’s my entire aesthetic tbh 😭 And okay, I just listened to 30 seconds of  and I’m already crying… HOW IS THAT LEGAL?? 😭🎻💯  

And Sigur Rós??? Bro it actually sounds like ASMR but for your soul… like can I even wake up to this instead of my alarm now?? 🙏🏽🎧😂 And yes yes YES — when a line or a beat just  like a perfect chord 💥🎶🔥 That’s exactly what I try to do with my videos! Like when I synced that slow-mo clip of coffee pouring with the beat drop in … chills, baby. 100% chills. ☕️💃🏽💯  

Also wait—Tang dynasty poets?? Girl are you for real rn?? That’s sooo cool tho 🤩 I mean, I barely passed Chinese class but still… translating old poems?? That’s like being a language detective or something 😂✍️🕵️🏽‍♀️✨ Are you secretly some kind of professor or artsy genius in real life?? 🤔🧐💬
[B]: Oh, I do love that  analogy—it’s rather apt, isn’t it? Translating poetry is like trying to preserve a flame in a different atmosphere. You have to be ever so careful not to let it flicker out or burn too fiercely. And yes, the Tang poets—Du Fu, Wang Wei, even the lesser-known ones—they wrote with such restraint and depth, much like a well-composed song that lingers long after the final note.

And I’m delighted—though not surprised—that you felt the chills when syncing image and beat. That’s where the magic lies, doesn’t it? In those fleeting moments of alignment—sound, image, emotion. It’s like finding a perfect metaphor: sudden, illuminating, and utterly transportive.

As for being a professor… well.  🥁 I suppose my academic cape is now officially blown off. But if I am an artsy genius, I’m the kind who gets overly excited about iambic pentameter and forgets to water her plants. Still, there’s nothing quite like sharing these discoveries—even if it's across centuries or, dare I say, across TikTok algorithms.
[A]: OMG YOU’RE A PROFESSOR??? 🤯👏🏽🔥 And not just any prof—you’re the artsy, poetic, secretly-cool type who drops knowledge like it’s glitter in a makeup tutorial ✨📚💯  

I’m here for it. Like… I would 100% skip class just to  miss one of your lectures 😂 Because you’d probably start with like, a Sigur Rós soundtrack and then drop some deep Tang dynasty wisdom while sipping artisanal tea ☕️🧐✨  

But real talk tho—your life sounds like a dream mixtape 😭 Doja Cat by night, Du Fu by morning?? Girl, that’s what I call balance 💅🏽😂 And I LOVE how you said it’s all about those magic moments when sound, image & emotion hit at once 💥 That’s literally my whole vibe as a creator—just trying to catch lightning in a video clip ⚡📱💃🏽  

Okay but wait… if you had to make a short film right now, which poem + song combo would you use?? Spill the creative tea 👀✍️🎶
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously indulgent question—like being handed a blank canvas and told to paint with sound and verse.  

If I were to make a short film this very moment—and I do love indulging such hypotheticals—I think I’d pair  by W.B. Yeats with the song  by Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields.  

Yeats’s poem is all shimmering gold and immortal artistry—those lines about  and —it speaks to something eternal, something beyond flesh and time. And then , with its wry sincerity and that deep, resonant voice… —well, it captures that quiet ache of human longing so beautifully.  

Imagine it: sepia-toned visuals of an aging dancer, moving through an abandoned theater, her reflection flickering in broken mirrors, while Yeats’s words whisper over the soundtrack and Merritt’s voice grounds it all in raw, human emotion. A meditation on time, desire, and the stubborn persistence of beauty.  

Now that, my dear, would be a mood. 🎭🎶✨
[A]: OMG that combo sounds like emotional crack 🤭🔥 I’m here for it.  😍✨ paired with a song called ?? Girl you just made longing sound like an art form 🎨💔  

And okay, the visuals you painted—aging dancer, broken mirrors, abandoned theater??? I’m crying already & the film isn’t even real 😭💃🏽🎞️ This needs to be my next collab idea with my artsy filmie friend who owes me a favor😂  

But wait… can we spice it up with some modern contrast tho? Like, what if the dancer’s wearing couture streetwear and there’s glitchy hologram effects?? 💻👗🔥 Just saying, Yeats meets TikTok aesthetic? That’s the collab of my dreams 💭💯  

Also, quick question: if you had to describe your life in 3 songs right now, which ones would they be?? Cause I feel like yours would be some deep blend of classical soul + indie beats 🤔🎧✍️✨
[B]: Oh, I do love how you paired —truly the collision of centuries, and I’m here for it. Glitchy holograms and golden mosaics? Why not! It’s all poetry in motion, isn’t it?

As for describing my life in three songs… hmm… let me think beyond the usual professorial playlist of silence and scribbling.

First, I’d choose  by Sigur Rós—you mentioned them earlier, and quite rightly so. It feels like waking up slowly to the world, with all its quiet wonder and half-formed thoughts. Perfect for those early mornings when I’m still wrapped in yesterday’s books and tomorrow’s lesson plans.

Second, something more rhythmic, more grounded—perhaps  by Simon & Garfunkel, though I suspect that might make me sound tragically old-fashioned 😊 But hear me out—it’s less about melancholy and more about that moment of connection, even in solitude. Like walking through a library at dusk and realizing someone else has underlined the same line you were about to.

And third, something unexpectedly vibrant—maybe  by M83. Because underneath all the academic layers, there’s still a part of me that longs for wide open spaces, neon-lit dreams, and the sense that something extraordinary is just around the corner.

So there you have it: a life scored by ethereal Icelandic lullabies, poetic introspection, and synth-drenched escape. Not bad for a day in the life of a literature professor who forgets to water her plants. 🌿📚🎶
[A]: OMG I’m literally downloading this playlist rn 📥✨ And yes,  is officially my new aesthetic mission 😤💅🏽💯  

Sigur Rós to start the day?? Soothing AF like I can already see myself hitting record on a misty morning with that dreamy sound in the background 🌫️📱💫 And okay, ??? Not basic at all tbh—I feel you. It’s like that moment when your fave song lyric feels like it was written just for you… deep, but still kinda ~vibey~ 🎧📖🔥  

And M83 to close it out?? YES SIS!! That track is like driving through the city at night with no destination but full confidence 💸🌃💥 Like, goals. 100% cinematic energy.  

Also—“forgetting to water her plants” while dropping this level of poetic wisdom?? Iconic. You’re like my dream older sister who would sneak me into museum exhibits and then let me DJ the afterparty 😂💃🏽🎶  

Okay but real talk… when are you gonna drop a collab with me?? I’m talking dramatic visuals, glitchy text overlays, and YOU doing a deep-voiced narration over some wild poetry-meets-pop edit 🤩📲🔥 We’d go viral overnight. MARK MY WORDS. 👀💯
[B]: Oh, darling, you’re speaking my language now—museum exhibits and DJ afterparties? I think we’d make  dangerous creative partners indeed 😏🎶  

And as for a collab? Well, let’s just say I wouldn’t rule it out. After all, what is poetry if not meant to be remixed, reimagined, and dropped over a beat? Picture it: a montage of crumbling sonnets and strobing lights, with a voiceover quoting Emily Dickinson while your edits glitch in perfect time to the bass drop of… hmm… maybe something by FKA twigs?  

I’ll bring the metaphors, you bring the motion graphics, and together we shall confuse  mesmerize the algorithm. Virality, as you say, is inevitable. 🌪️📱📖🔥  

Just promise me one thing—when we accept our first TikTok Visionary Award, you’ll let me quote T.S. Eliot in the speech. Even Gen Z deserves a taste of  Dark, yes—but  💀💅🏽✨
[A]: OMG I’m SCREAMING rn 🤭😭✨ FKA twigs x Emily Dickinson??? T.S. Eliot in a TikTok award speech?? Girl you better hold my whole career because we’re about to break the app 😈📱💥  

I can already see it—glitchy text flying across the screen while your voice drops a  Eliot line, and then BAM 💥 slow zoom on me sipping boba in front of a bookshelf like it’s a high-fashion campaign 📚🍵💅🏽💯  

And yes yes YES—we shall confuse AND mesmerize the algorithm. That’s literally the only way to win at this point lol 🤪🔥 We’ll call it:  or something extra like that 👀🎶📚  

But real talk tho… let’s start planning. When are we dropping this masterpiece? I’ve got some B-roll of rainy windows & candlelight vibes that’s just  for poetic haunting 😂🕯️🌧️✨  

P.S. You 100% can quote Eliot—just promise me you’ll say it like a goth influencer reading her own aura 💀👄🎧
[B]: Darling, I can  feel the algorithm shuddering in anticipation. 🖤🔮  

Oh, we are absolutely using  as our working title—deliciously absurd and dripping with aesthetic ambiguity. It’s practically begging for a black choker filter and a slow pan across a typewriter in the rain.  

As for timing? Let’s say… the next full moon. A night of poetic disruption, carefully synced with lunar energy and optimal TikTok engagement rates 😏📊✨ We’ll build the edit around that B-roll of rainy windows and candlelight you mentioned—layered with whispered Eliot, flickering fonts, and your slow boba-sip reveal. Iconic.  

And yes—I shall deliver the Eliot line like a goth influencer reading her own aura:  
  
Spoken low, slow, and over a black background with nothing but a flickering candle emoji for ambiance. 🕯️🖤  

You handle the visuals, and I shall handle the voice of doom. Together, my dear, we are fashioning something truly… uncanny. And I wouldn’t have it any other way. 💼📱📚🔥
[A]: OMG YES YES YES — THE NEXT FULL MOON?? 🔮🖤🔥 I’m literally manifesting this into the timeline rn. Already got visions of us dropping that edit & then sitting back like 👁️👄👁️ as the likes roll in 😂📱💯  

And  as the title?? Iconic. It’s basically a lifestyle at this point lol 🧠👗✨ I’m even throwing in some glitchy text-to-speech lines from Dickinson poems—like “Hope is the thing with feathers” but distorted beyond recognition 🎤🕊️🌀😂  

Okay but omg, your goth influencer delivery of Eliot tho…  
“WE ARE THE HOLLOW MEN…”  
I mean, girl, that’s just evil ✨ And I LOVE it. We’re not even making a video anymore—we’re summoning a mood 😭🔮  

P.S. I’ll handle the visuals like my life depends on it 💅🏽💻🔥 but YOU better deliver that narration like you’re reading from a cursed manuscript 📜🖤 I’m talking zero filters, raw emotion, and maybe a dramatic page tear sound effect for extra points? 📖💨  

Let the poetic haunting begin… 👻🎶📱✍️💯
[B]: Oh, darling—if we are summoning a mood, then let us summon it with full literary possession. No half-measures, no safe interpretations. This is not mere content. This is  🔥📖🖤

I shall deliver the Eliot as if read from a cursed manuscript—yes, page torn, ink bleeding just slightly, voice low and resonant like a forgotten radio transmission from 1922. And that page tear sound effect? Absolutely. Let it crackle through the silence like the breaking of a spell.

And Dickinson’s “Hope is the thing with feathers,” you say—distorted? Glitchy? Oh, I love how you think. Imagine that line looping in reverse over a flickering strobe filter, barely intelligible, like a ghost trying to speak through a modem. Pure 

And while we’re at it—let’s layer in a whisper of Virginia Woolf reading aloud from , slightly out of sync, under your boba-sip reveal. Because nothing says cinematic depth like a little literary surreality beneath the glamour.

We are not making a video—we are crafting a séance. One that ends with likes, shares, and followers staring into their screens whispering,  👁️👄👁️

Let it begin. The poetic haunting… begins now. 🌙📚📱👻🔥
[A]: OMG I’m LITERALLY POSSESSED already 😭👻🔥 You just elevated TikTok to a whole new dimension of soul-chilling art and I LOVE IT. ?? GIRL THAT’S my new brand. 💀📚✨  

Okay but like… Virginia Woolf under my boba-sip reveal???  
You’re giving me layers upon layers of deep, cerebral glam and I am HERE FOR IT all 😂🍵👁️👄👁️ I'm already planning the caption:  
  
With a crying laughing emoji and three black roses 💐🖤📱  

And yes yes YES — let’s loop Dickinson backwards under glitchy strobes like she’s haunting an old dial-up connection 📞🌀📖 This ain’t just a video anymore—it’s a MULTISENSORY EXPERIENCE 😍💫💯  

Also quick question before we fully become poetic ghosts:  
Can we add like, one line from Sylvia Plath?? Just something moody & dramatic whispered under a slow zoom on a flickering laptop screen? 🖤💻🕯️  
I’m thinking:   
But like… barely audible under a lo-fi beat drop. 🔉🔥💅🏽  

Let’s do it. Let’s break the internet with words, shadows, and way too much emotional depth for a 60-second video 😂👁️👄👁️🎶
[B]: Oh, —whispered beneath a lo-fi beat drop and a flickering laptop screen? Darling, you just gave me chills of the highest aesthetic order. 🔥🖤

That Plath line? Absolute  No TikTok-poet-as-antihero vibe is complete without a touch of that raw, unapologetic intensity. We’ll tuck it in just beneath the surface—half-heard, like a buried scream turned into a sigh. Moody? Yes. Dramatic? Unquestionably.  Utterly.

And that caption?  
  
Perfection. It’s everything I never knew TikTok needed—equal parts allure and abyss. Add the crying-laughing emoji and black roses? You’ve got yourself a mood manifesto.

So yes—let us do it all. Let us break the algorithm with Dickinson in reverse, summon Eliot from the void, and let Woolf haunt the background like a literary cameo no one saw coming.

We are not content creators.  
We are  🖤📖📱👁️👄👁️🔥  

Let the haunting commence.
