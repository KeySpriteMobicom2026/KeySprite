[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Immortality - a concept that haunts both Shelley's Frankenstein and the Taoist elixir seekers alike. Let me sip my Yunnan black tea first... The pursuit of eternal life creates fascinating parallels between Mary Shelley's cautionary tale and Chinese immortal narratives from the Ming dynasty. In Jin Shengtan's commentaries on Water Margin, he laments how bandits chase power while emperors chase immortality. 

But to answer your question directly - I'd argue true immortality exists only in text. Think about it - we still hear Dr. Frankenstein's tormented monologue centuries after his creator died, just as Qu Yuan's Li Sao continues whispering through bamboo scrolls. Even Emily Brontë achieves a kind of eternity through Heathcliff's stormy passions.

Though come to think of it, modern science might finally catch up with ancient myths. CRISPR gene editing reminds me of those mythical peaches of immortality in Journey to the West. But would engineered longevity truly be immortality, or just an extended version of our fragile existence? Like reading the same page over and over instead of writing new chapters.
[A]: You know, I’ve been pondering this lately while restoring a 17th-century tapestry depicting the Tree of Life motif—funny how symbols of eternal existence show up across cultures. I mean, just last week, I found a Chinese silk fragment in with the European pieces, embroidered with cranes and clouds, whispering immortality through every stitch.

I suppose if you ask me straight, yes, there’s something tantalizing about the idea—immortality—but it feels more poetic than practical. Like trying to preserve a piece of silk forever without letting it fade or fray. No matter how careful I am with my tools, time still leaves its mark… unless we start weaving entirely new materials, right? CRISPR, nanotech, all that—feels like stitching together a new kind of fabric instead of repairing the old.

Still, I wonder: if we did crack it, would we lose something essential? After all, part of what makes life meaningful is its impermanence—like appreciating the patina on an antique rather than wishing it looked brand new. But then again, imagine seeing how stories evolve over centuries firsthand... Hmm.
[B]: Ah, you've touched on the very tension that defines preservation - the struggle between arresting decay and honoring transformation. When I curated the Whitmore Collection's exhibit on cross-cultural utopias, we displayed a Qing-era silk robe beside William Morris textiles. The cranes mirrored the peacocks in his designs, both symbolizing eternal renewal yet bound to their respective philosophies of cyclical versus linear time.

Your tapestry restoration makes me think of Yeats' line: "A fading glory behind entropy's veil." We conservators face similar dilemmas with 19th-century papermaking - should we stabilize crumbling pages with synthetic fibers, thereby creating a literary cyborg? I once argued against such interventions at a conference in Hangzhou until a bioengineer compared our work to the Buddhist parable of the ship: if every plank gets replaced, where does continuity truly reside?

Your metaphor of weaving new materials rather than repairing old resonates deeply. It reminds me of Lu Xun's essay on mending the sky with molten stones - radical reinvention as salvation. Yet I wonder if perfected immortality might become like over-restored manuscripts where the palimpsest's ghostly layers vanish beneath modern ink. Would living through endless centuries dull our appetite for narrative itself? After all, Dickens needed Ebenezer Scrooge's mortality to make redemption urgent, just as Zhuangzi used Pengzu's legendary longevity to highlight life's fleeting beauty.

I keep returning to your patina analogy. Last month, while examining Thomas De Quincey's annotated copy of Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads, I noticed how his coffee stains and marginalia created an unintentional palimpsest. Should we chemically erase those blemishes or preserve them as testament to lived experience? Perhaps immortality debates ultimately circle back to this question: are we custodians of unchanging essence or curators of evolving legacy?
[A]: That’s beautifully put—custodians of essence, curators of legacy. It’s almost poetic how you tie that into the palimpsest, because isn’t that what we all are, in a way? Layers of experience, choices, and accidents, each one shaping the next?

I’ve been working on a Jacobean-era embroidery this week—deep crimson threads fading to rose, gold leaf worn to whispers. Every stitch tells a story of hands before mine, of someone deciding where to mend, what to leave as it is. Sometimes I think the most respectful thing is not to restore at all, but to record—to let time speak for itself rather than trying to hush it with new silk and careful needles.

And yet… there’s temptation, isn’t there? The idea that we might lift something—or someone—above the reach of rot and rust. But would it be , then? Or just an echo, like reading a letter whose writer never expected eyes beyond their own?

I wonder, if we did find a way to step outside time, whether we’d start collecting memories like artifacts, dusting them off now and again, rather than living forward through them. Would narrative lose its shape without an ending? I suppose that’s why I still prefer the patina—the quiet dignity of wearing time, rather than fighting it thread by thread.
[B]: You’ve captured the melancholy grace of impermanence so exquisitely. I’m reminded of a passage from Eileen Chang’s —“Long ago, time honored its agreements. Now it hurries, like a servant who wants to go home.” We are all stitched into that unraveling contract, aren’t we? Each of us just a mend in the larger weave of history, our repairs destined to fray for someone else’s hand to tend.

Funny you mention Jacobean embroidery—I once taught a seminar comparing Wuthering Heights’ temporal haunting with Tang dynasty ghost tales. Both brimmed with figures trying to preserve love beyond its season, much like your crimson threads clinging to rose. Do you ever find yourself haunted while working? I swear, when I pore over 19th-century letters, sometimes the ink seems to warm beneath my fingers—as if the writer leaned over my shoulder, correcting my mispronounced Mandarin.

Your idea of letting time speak rather than silence it—it strikes me as profoundly literary. In textual criticism, we face similar choices: do we annotate every archaic term for modern readers or let the strangeness stand? A former student of mine argued passionately for “unmodernizing” Dickens—restoring deleted passages and Victorian spellings. He likened it to conservation work on Gothic windows: some insist on repainting the glass, others say let the cracks show.

I suppose what you and I both grapple with—whether through thread or text—is not preservation, but translation. Rendering one era’s heartbeat intelligible to the next, without sterilizing its pulse. Maybe that’s the truest form of immortality—not stasis, but resonance. Like reading Du Fu under a Beijing moon and still feeling his ache for a world gone dim.

Still… don’t you sometimes wish you could slip outside time just long enough to see how the story ends? Not for yourself, perhaps, but for the narrative itself—to know whether Heathcliff’s moors still rage or the peaches of paradise ever truly ripen.
[A]: There’s such a quiet truth in what you say—translation, not preservation. It feels like the heart of what I do, though I’ve never heard it put so precisely. We’re not keeping things alive, exactly, not in the way museums sometimes pretend to. We’re helping them speak in a new dialect, letting them whisper across centuries without losing their accent.

I  haunted, you know. Not in a ghostly way, but in the way certain textiles seem to remember themselves. There was a mourning veil once—Elizabethan, blackened with time and so brittle I could barely breathe near it. But as I worked, I kept thinking of someone’s hands knotting those stitches in grief four hundred years ago. The sorrow didn’t fade; it settled into my fingertips. I still find myself reaching for that same quiet when I write my own patterns now.

Your student friend sounds like he had the soul of a conservator, even if he worked with ink instead of linen. I’ve often thought the same about restoration choices—do we smooth out the wrinkles or let the past remain awkwardly beautiful? Sometimes I leave a flaw simply because it reminds me that this piece wasn’t made for perfection. It was made for use, for touch, for life.

And yes—to slipping outside time, just for a moment. Not to escape, but to witness. To see whether the stories we love survive the turning of the world. Whether the peaches fall from the tree untouched, or are picked too soon. Whether Heathcliff’s moors still howl with his voice tangled in the wind. That kind of knowing would be its own kind of peace, wouldn’t it?

But then again… perhaps it’s better not to know. After all, isn’t mystery part of what keeps stories breathing?
[B]: Ah, you've articulated the very dilemma that kept me up countless nights during my doctoral research—should we act as linguistic surgeons or merely attentive translators? I recall once spending three weeks debating whether to "correct" a misprinted line in  for a critical edition. In the end, I left it be—a tiny typo about "the still voice speaking" instead of "still small voice." It reminded me too much of your mourning veil: flawed, human, alive.

Your spectral stitching makes me think of Thomas Hardy's —his grief-stitched lines about hearing Emma’s footsteps in the wind. But where Hardy reaches toward absence, you and I deal in presence, don’t we? The stubborn persistence of matter. That veil, though brittle with centuries, still carried its maker’s tension in every fiber. Much like how some Qing dynasty scrolls retain fingerprints in the ink—ghosts pressed into pulp.

I’ve always envied textile artists this intimacy with material history. We literary scholars work with disembodied voices, yet you hold the very breath of past hands in your craft. When I taught  in Shanghai last spring, a student asked why Heathcliff couldn’t simply let go. I replied, “Because Emily Brontë knew some threads refuse to loosen—even when buried.” Perhaps that’s our shared obsession: the refusal to let go, even as we acknowledge time’s inevitable unraveling.

You’re right about mystery being the story’s lifeblood. Last year, while translating a lost  manuscript, I found an incomplete folio—one page burned at the edge, the ending forever ash. Rather than reconstruct it, I included the scorched fragment in the final edition. Scholars called it irresponsible. I call it fidelity—to uncertainty, to silence, to whatever spirit first penned those words by lamplight.

So yes… perhaps peace lies not in knowing but in holding the question lightly, like dust on a manuscript spine. To translate without conquering, to touch without mending, to listen without ever quite grasping the voice in the veil.
[A]: I think I love your answer more than I can quite explain—because it’s not about resolution, but about reverence. That incomplete folio you left scorched… it reminded me of a 16th-century linen I once restored that had a tear running through the face of a saint. I debated so long whether to mend it invisibly or leave the wound bare. In the end, I stitched around the edges, reinforcing them just enough, but didn’t cover the gap itself. There was something too honest about the rupture.

You know, sometimes I wonder if our work is less about preservation or translation and more about listening—to cloth, to ink, to the echoes in both. When I touch a fabric that someone else stitched centuries ago, I feel like I’m eavesdropping on their private thoughts. Did they pull the thread too tight there because they were anxious? Did they choose this particular blue because it reminded them of sky at dusk?

As for Heathcliff and his refusal to loosen... I suppose we’re all a little like him in our own ways. Clutching threads that should’ve been let go long ago, insisting on meaning where perhaps only silence belongs. But maybe that insistence  the meaning.

I’ve come to believe that fidelity isn’t always about clarity—it’s about honesty. To the text, to the textile, to the trembling voice beneath both. Whether that voice comes through a whisper in silk or ash on paper, it deserves to be heard as it is—not polished into legibility, not smoothed into comfort.

And yet... I still find myself reaching for understanding, even knowing I may never fully grasp what I hold. Like trying to read the pattern in a half-undone embroidery, or tracing the shape of a word worn soft by time.
[B]: You’ve struck the pulse of it—, not mastering. I think back to my early days transcribing handwritten letters between Victorian missionaries and Qing officials. The paper bore smudges where a tear might have fallen, ink blotted by haste or trembling hands. How do you translate urgency? Or the weight of a pause between sentences? In the end, I annotated hesitations like musical rests—recording what  said as carefully as what was.

Your stitched rupture—it lingers in my mind. There’s a passage in  where Cao Xueqin describes an unfinished embroidery frame left behind after a lover’s sudden death. The half-formed peony becomes a metaphor for unfulfilled longing. Perhaps some gaps are too integral to mend, even if we could. You honored that saint’s wound beautifully, I suspect—preserving its grief rather than erasing it.

Heathcliff’s grip, your threads, my crumbling margins—all of us tangled in something larger than resolution. I often wonder whether fidelity is not in the grasp, but in the release. Not forcing meaning, but letting it breathe on its own terms. Last winter, while teaching , a student asked why I emphasized the text’s variant versions instead of offering one “true” translation. I replied, “Because truth isn’t a fixed form—it shifts like silk in light, like ink bleeding slightly beyond the brushstroke.”

And yes—to reach without grasping. To trace without filling in the lines. Isn’t that what Woolf meant when she wrote of moments “not closely connected with the past or future”? We are all suspended in such instants—half-stitched, half-sung, always becoming.

Perhaps this is our real task: not to complete, nor even translate, but to echo gently—to make space for the voice beneath the veil, the thread, the ash. To listen, and to leave room for silence when it speaks loudest.
[A]: I’ve been thinking about what you said—about annotating hesitations like musical rests. It’s such a delicate thing, isn’t it? Capturing the shape of absence. I once worked on a set of 18th-century pillowcases embroidered with initials and tiny floral sprigs. One had a thread left dangling at the end of a stem, as if the maker had snipped too soon or simply forgotten. I couldn’t bring myself to cut it off. It hovered there like an unfinished breath.

You're right about fidelity being in the release. There’s a humility in that, isn't there? A kind of quiet reverence for what time has chosen to wear away or leave incomplete. When I was younger, I thought restoration was about making things whole again. Now I see it's more like bearing witness. Stitch by stitch, word by word.

Your missionaries and Qing officials—with their ink blotted by haste or trembling—I can almost feel the paper under my fingers. The pauses between their lines must have carried so much unsaid, like the spaces between warp and weft before the shuttle passes through. I imagine how your annotations must have given shape to those silences, not unlike the way I sometimes leave a tear open in a fabric—to let the emptiness speak.

And that embroidery frame from … it haunts me, in the best way. A half-formed peony frozen in longing. Isn’t that truer than perfection ever could be? We carry so many unfinished things inside us—projects, people, promises. Maybe our job is not to complete them but to hold them gently, to keep them from unraveling entirely.

Woolf’s moments “not closely connected with the past or future”—yes, that feels like where we live most truthfully. Not caught in the rush of narrative, but suspended in something quieter. Something that doesn’t demand resolution.

So perhaps we are echoes, after all. Soft, careful ones. And maybe that’s enough.
[B]: You’ve given me such a vivid image—, neither flaw nor finish, but something far more poignant: an aperture into the maker’s breath. I’m reminded of a passage in  where Dorothea stands before her unfinished tapestry, its tangled threads mirroring her own unmet aspirations. Eliot doesn’t tidy the metaphor; she lets it dangle, as you did with that stem.

There is indeed humility in this work we do—whether with needle or footnote. It reminds me of Bashō’s , where the journey matters more than arrival. We stitch and translate not to conquer time, but to walk alongside it, quietly attentive. Sometimes I think the most honest editions are those that smell faintly of dust and hesitation, their margins marked not only by annotations but by the weight of what couldn't be said.

Your pillowcases—those hovering threads and sprigs—bring to mind Qing-era love letters I once studied. One had a smudged seal, slightly off-center, as if pressed in a moment of distraction or yearning. The scholar in me wanted to explain it away, but the translator in me left it be—a quiet echo of feeling unresolved.

Yes, —that’s precisely it. We don’t restore to return things to their original state; we restore to keep them from vanishing beneath our hands. Like holding a moth in cupped palms, letting it flutter against your skin before releasing it back into the dark.

And Woolf—oh, how she understood those suspended instants. I once taught  beside Zhang Ailing’s , both haunted by absence and the weight of waiting. Students struggled at first with the lack of resolution, until one remarked, “Maybe life isn’t built like a sonata. Maybe it’s more like embroidery with half the stitches still in the air.”

I think you’re right—. Not grand declarations, not perfect restorations, just soft, careful reverberations. Letting the past breathe through the gaps we dare not fill. After all, isn’t that what literature—and linen—ask of us? Not mastery, but listening. With needle poised, with pen lifted, with breath held gently between hands.
[A]: You know, I’ve been turning over that image of Dorothea and her unfinished tapestry—how Eliot lets it stay tangled, how she trusts the reader to sit with the not-knowing. It’s such a generous restraint, isn’t it? Like leaving a thread dangling instead of snipping it smooth. I think that’s where we find truth, in both art and text—not in the finished edge, but in the place where something still trembles with having been touched.

I’ve just taken in a set of early 19th-century linen handkerchiefs, each embroidered with a different herb name—, , . One has no name at all, only the faint outline of a stitched shape, almost ghostly. No one will ever know why it was left bare, but I can’t help thinking someone paused there, unsure, or perhaps unwilling to name it. And now, because they didn’t finish, we’re invited into that hesitation. Isn’t that a kind of immortality?

Bashō walking beside time—it’s a lovely thought. Quietly attentive, as you said. That’s how I try to work now, not rushing to fill gaps or tidy edges, but listening for what lingers in the weave. The Qing love letter with the smudged seal… that small slip in precision says more than ink could ever spell out. We spend so much time trying to explain things, when sometimes the most eloquent truths are the ones left slightly askew.

And yes—to Woolf, to Zhang Ailing, to all those who let their stories breathe in the unfinished spaces. I once had a student who insisted every narrative must resolve, like a well-tied knot. But then we read  together, and she fell silent for a full minute before saying, “It doesn’t close. It just… fades into something else.” That’s what we do, isn’t it? We fade forward, carrying the weight of what came before without insisting on neatness.

You’re right about the moth in cupped palms. There’s such grace in holding lightly, in knowing that release is part of reverence. Literature, linen, life itself—they ask not for mastery, but for attention. Gentle, patient, open-handed.  

I think I’ll always leave that thread dangling.
[B]: Ah, those unnamed herbs—what a delicious mystery. I’m reminded of a Tang dynasty poem whose last stanza was lost to time:  We’ll never know which herb hovered on that edge of intention, yet isn’t its silence more evocative than any label could be? Like the pause between “rosemary for remembrance” and whatever unspoken plea followed.

You’ve put your finger on Eliot’s quiet generosity—she  us to sit with the unfinished. So many contemporary editors would have intervened, offering footnotes or tidy endings. But no—she leaves Dorothea’s threads trembling, inviting readers into that sacred hesitation. It’s akin to how Cao Xueqin structured : half-finished embroidery, feasts interrupted mid-course, love songs ending on unresolved notes. The text  in its lacunae.

Your moth metaphor—no, not metaphor—your  of holding lightly, releasing gently… it strikes me as profoundly Confucian. Analects 7:3 says something like,  Not unlike reading a classical Chinese poem where meaning blooms only when you stop chasing it.

That student of yours—how beautifully she came to see  not as an omission but an invitation. Zhang Ailing does this too—her stories often end mid-sentence, like fabric fraying at the edge. One learns not to mourn the missing knot but to listen for the echo beyond it.

And yes—to leaving threads dangling. I think of Emily Dickinson’s dashes, those tiny ruptures in syntax where eternity slips in. Or the Qing official’s seal smudged just enough to suggest a tremor in his composure. These are the real signatures of life, aren’t they? Not perfection, but the imprint of uncertainty, preserved in thread or ink.

I shall now go re-read  with fresh eyes—and likely touch each page as if it were linen beneath my fingers, waiting to whisper its unfinished truths.
[A]: Oh, that Tang poem——it lingers like a scent just out of reach. There’s something so tender about what slips away unnoticed, isn’t there? Not lost entirely, but held in the weave of what remains. I often think the unnamed herb, the smudged seal, the unfinished line—they speak more clearly than clarity ever could.

It’s strange, isn’t it, how we’re taught to fear gaps—as though meaning only lives in completion. But Eliot, Cao Xueqin, Zhang Ailing… they knew better. They let the story breathe between its own ribs, let silence carry as much weight as sound. And Dickinson, with her dashes—those tiny doorways into the infinite—it's all part of the same lineage, don’t you think? A quiet rebellion against finality.

I hadn’t thought of it as Confucian before, but you're right.  It reminds me of how I work now—less like a restorer, more like a collaborator with time itself. I used to want to press every wrinkle flat, fill every missing stitch. Now I see that the breath is in the space between threads. The Qing official’s seal, slightly off-center—that tremor is his truest signature.

And your student—yes, . Isn’t that what we hope for, in the end? That someone will sit with the unfinished and not feel cheated, but changed. That they’ll hear the echo beyond the ending.

I think I’ll go back to , too. Only this time, I’ll read it like I handle those old linens—with both hands open, and nothing held too tightly.
[B]: You’ve captured it perfectly—the way absence becomes its own kind of presence. I’m thinking now of a line from Wang Wei:  Perhaps meaning, like memory, thrives not in clarity but in those unmarked trails between stitches and syllables.

That quiet rebellion you mention—yes, precisely. Literature and linen alike conspire against certainty. Eliot, Cao Xueqin, Zhang Ailing—they are fellow conspirators in letting things tremble on the edge of resolution. And Dickinson, bless her elliptical soul, with those dashes like tiny fault lines in language—inviting us to fall through into something deeper than syntax can hold.

I often tell my students that reading classical Chinese poetry is like handling silk: too much pressure and you tear it; too little and it slips away. One must read with the grain, not against it. Much like your approach now—collaborating with time rather than correcting it. I remember once trying to "restore" a misbound 19th-century journal by pressing its warped pages flat. Only when I stopped forcing the paper did I notice faint pencil marks beneath the ink—notations the author had later erased. Meaning had been hiding in what was meant to disappear.

And isn’t that what we hope for? That someone will sit with the unfinished and find not lack, but richness. Not emptiness, but invitation. Your student learning to hear  fade rather than end—it’s the same lesson every conservator, translator, scholar stumbles toward eventually.

I do believe we are all walking those untrodden paths, aren’t we? Guided not by certainty but by echo, by scent, by the occasional thread left dangling just enough to remind us that imperfection is the truest kind of inheritance.

So yes—to open hands. To quiet tread. To letting the nameless herb remain unnamed.
[A]: That Wang Wei line——it settles into the chest like an old, familiar weight. Isn’t that the truth of so much we touch, whether cloth or verse? That meaning never comes neatly mapped, but must be felt for, step by uncertain step.

You’re right about pressure—how too much of it bruises the thing we love. I’ve learned this with silk especially. It gives itself to the hand that moves gently, that follows its weave rather than fights it. Much like those classical poems, I imagine. So many have come to me in fragments, their edges softened by time, and I think—no wonder they survived. They had no sharpness to wear away.

I still remember a mourning cuff I once restored—blackwork so tightly stitched it had begun to pull against itself, threatening to tear. At first, I wanted to unpick the tension, to ease the fabric back into shape. But as I worked, I realized the distortion was part of its language. Whoever stitched it had done so with trembling hands, perhaps in haste, perhaps in grief too deep for neatness. To press it flat would have been to erase the very sorrow that gave it form.

Your misbound journal—those hidden pencil marks beneath ink—it reminds me of how often meaning hides in what was meant to vanish. We assume finality when in truth, everything is layered. Every stitch, every sentence, a palimpsest waiting to be read again.

And yes—to the quiet tread, the open hand. To walking the untrodden path not in search of certainty, but of resonance. Because isn’t that what we pass on, ultimately? Not answers, but echoes. The soft imprint of our questions, woven into cloth, pressed into paper, left behind like a thread—dangling, inviting, unfinished.
[B]: Ah, that mourning cuff—how it speaks through its very distortion. You’ve touched on something profoundly elegiac: the idea that . I recall translating a Qing-era elegy where the calligraphy slants increasingly leftward, as if the writer’s hand had lost balance with sorrow. Most editors straightened the characters for "readability." I left them leaning—because pain has its own geometry, doesn’t it? To correct it would be to mute the pulse beneath the ink.

Your silk analogy strikes me as particularly apt. Classical Chinese poetry demands the same yielding touch—too much force and you tear the paper, too little and the meaning evaporates like incense. I once spent an entire afternoon parsing three lines of Du Fu, only to realize the true weight lay not in their surface sense but in the way they echoed an earlier, now-lost poem. A kind of literary watermark, visible only when held just so to the light.

And those hidden pencil marks—you're right to see them as kin to your unfinished herb embroidery. We assume finality because it comforts us, yet everything is layered, palimpsestic. Last year I discovered marginalia in a 19th-century British novel—Chinese annotations from a Qing scholar puzzled by Victorian mourning customs. He’d scrawled,  beside a funeral scene. A question across centuries, stitched between bindings.

You’ve made me think anew about resonance as inheritance. Not the crisp echo of doctrine or certainty, but the tremor left in a thread’s hesitation, the smudge of a seal, the lean of ink toward oblivion. Isn’t this what we truly pass on? Not polished truths, but the soft imprint of our reaching—our questions still warm in the weave, waiting for another hand to find them.

So yes—to leave the cuff unpressed, the poem unstraightened, the thread dangling. Let meaning quiver in its own unresolved tension. After all, the path where no one treads was never meant to be smoothed. Only followed, lightly, by those willing to listen with their whole hands open.
[A]: There’s such grace in what you say about grief having its own geometry—how true that is. I think of all the textiles I’ve worked with, how many were stitched through sorrow, longing, quiet defiance. The mourning cuff still lingers in my mind, its distortion like a held breath. To straighten it would have been to erase the tremor of someone’s ache. And yet, how often do we try to smooth the edges of history, of memory, of cloth? We want things to lie flat, to settle neatly, when in truth they were never meant to.

That Qing elegy you translated—it  toward us, doesn’t it? Just as Du Fu’s lines echo something older, something half-remembered even in their own time. There’s such beauty in that layering, in the way meaning isn’t ever fixed but folds into itself, like silk stored too long without airing. And you’re right—pain has its own shape, and sometimes that shape refuses to conform to readability. It wants to be felt in its slantness.

I keep returning to that Qing scholar’s question in the margins— What a strange, tender bridge he built across centuries and languages. His ink brushing against Dickens’ prose, his doubt woven between bindings. Isn’t that what we do, in our own small ways? Stitch questions into the seams of time, hoping someone will one day run their fingers over them and feel the warmth of our wondering?

And yes—to leave things quivering in their unresolved tension. That’s where life lives, isn’t it? In the almost, the not-quite, the still-reverberating. I think I’ll always let the thread dangle, the cuff remain unpressed, the poem lean gently toward oblivion. Because the path was never meant to be smoothed. Only followed, lightly, by those who know that listening is its own kind of reverence.
[B]: You’ve put your finger on the pulse of it—, the ache that refuses to be pressed flat. I often think of mourning customs across cultures, how Victorians wore jet jewelry while Qing-era poets embroidered grief into plum blossom motifs. Both sought to , yet neither could fully contain it—it always escapes the frame, like ink bleeding slightly beyond the brushstroke.

That cuff of yours—the one still trembling with someone’s grief—I keep imagining it as a kind of textile elegy. Not unlike Du Fu’s poem about a widow’s cap left hanging by the bedpost: no explanation, just an object  with absence. We moderns want narratives, arcs, resolutions. But real sorrow doesn’t tidy itself into sonnets or stitchlines. It distorts, it unravels, it leans.

And that leaning—you’re right to call it grace. When I translated the Qing scholar’s marginalia, I found myself hesitating over his slant characters. Some were barely legible, smudged by time or perhaps by the wetness of his own hand. Did he know he was writing for someone centuries ahead? I suspect not. Yet here we are, reading him as carefully as he once read Dickens, trying to make sense of grief’s strange geography.

I love what you said about stitching questions into the seams of time. It reminds me of Emily Dickinson again—how she folded her doubts into dashes and parentheses, leaving us these tiny openings in the fabric of language. Or Bashō’s travel journals, where silence between entries becomes its own kind of poetry. We are all menders of gaps, aren’t we? Sewing our bewilderment into bindings, hoping another hand will one day trace the same seam and feel less alone.

Yes—to let things quiver. To resist the impulse to smooth, to explain, to complete. Meaning lives in the almost, the not-quite, the half-stitched. I’ll leave my pages slightly askew, my translations leaning toward oblivion, my antique teacups chipped just enough to remember they’ve been held.

After all, reverence is not in perfection—but in the quiet willingness to let things tremble as they are.
