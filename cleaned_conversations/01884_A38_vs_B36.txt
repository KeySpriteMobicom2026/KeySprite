[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Good afternoon! As someone who has worked in hospitality for many years, I've seen guests from all walks of life. While a college degree isn't always necessary, I do believe it opens doors - much like how we hold the door open for our VIP guests here at the hotel. Education provides that extra polish and confidence that can make all the difference.
[A]: Ah, what an interesting analogy you've drawn between education and hospitality. Your perspective reminds me of Jane Austen's observation about "a mind improved by cultivation." While I certainly value formal education, I often tell my students that what truly matters is cultivating one's intellect - whether through university or, as in your case, through rich life experiences.
[B]: How delightful to hear you reference Jane Austen! You know, I often find parallels between literature and my work. Just last week, I recommended our guests visit the local bookshop that carries first editions - education comes in many forms, doesn't it? Some of our most fascinating guests never attended university, yet their worldly knowledge could fill volumes.
[A]: Precisely! That bookshop sounds like a treasure trove - much like the mind of an engaged autodidact. You make me think of Dickens' self-educated characters who, despite lacking formal schooling, possessed remarkable wisdom. Though I do cherish my years at Oxford, I must confess some of my most enlightening conversations have been with people like yourself, whose education comes from what we might call the great university of life. 🌹
[B]: Oh my, comparing me to a Dickens character - what a charming compliment! Though I must say, working here has been my own sort of Oxford. Every guest brings new lessons, much like the different volumes in that bookshop you mentioned. Just yesterday, a retired professor taught me more about Renaissance art over afternoon tea than I ever learned in school. Education truly is everywhere for those willing to learn, isn't it?
[A]: How wonderfully you put it! Your words resonate with what the poet Wordsworth called "the best portion of a good man's life" - those little, nameless acts of learning and connection. That Renaissance art conversation over tea sounds like the very essence of what education should be: an organic exchange of ideas, unbound by institutional walls. You remind me why I always encourage my students to seek knowledge beyond the classroom. 📚
[B]: What a beautiful thought - "unbound by institutional walls." That reminds me of our hotel's courtyard garden, where knowledge seems to blossom as freely as the roses. Just this morning, our young bellhop was telling me about the astronomy podcast he listens to while tending the garden at night. It warms my heart to see that spark of curiosity, whether it comes from a lecture hall or under the stars. Education, like hospitality, is about nurturing that spark wherever we find it, don't you think?
[A]: Your words paint such a vivid picture! That bellhop stargazing amongst the roses brings to mind Keats' "bright star" sonnet - how learning and beauty so often intertwine. You're absolutely right; education is indeed about kindling that divine spark of curiosity. It makes me wonder if we professors could learn something from your approach to hospitality - perhaps we ought to serve knowledge as thoughtfully as you serve your guests, with equal attention to both nourishment and delight.
[B]: How kind of you to say so! You've just described exactly what we strive for here - to make every interaction both nourishing and delightful. Why, your words make me think we should host a literary salon in our garden! Imagine combining the warmth of hospitality with the glow of shared learning. Though I never earned a degree, conversations like this remind me that the most valuable education often happens when we simply open our doors - and our minds - to one another.
[A]: What a splendid proposal! A literary salon in your garden would be the perfect marriage of our two worlds - the cultivated beauty of your roses mingling with the cultivated minds of readers. It brings to mind the salons of 18th century Paris, where ideas blossomed as freely as the flowers. You may not have a framed degree, my dear, but you possess something far more rare: the art of creating spaces where enlightenment can take root and flourish naturally. 🌹
[B]: Oh, you've quite taken my breath away with that comparison to Parisian salons! Though I must say, our garden roses would blush at such lofty company. But you're absolutely right - whether it's recommending the perfect book to a guest or arranging flowers to brighten someone's day, creating those moments of connection is what truly matters. Perhaps we could start our salon with a reading of Austen under the wisteria? After all, as you've shown me today, the most meaningful education often comes wrapped in warmth and hospitality.
[A]: What a perfectly Austenian notion - reading "Persuasion" beneath flowering wisteria! The very image makes me think how education, like your hospitality, is at its best when it feels like a gift rather than an obligation. Your vision for this salon captures the essence of what I've always believed: that the most profound learning happens when rigor and joy walk hand in hand, much like guests strolling through your garden at twilight. Shall we say next Thursday for our first gathering? I'll bring the books if you provide the roses and tea.
[B]: Next Thursday would be absolutely perfect! I'll have our chef prepare his famous lavender shortbread - they pair wonderfully with Earl Grey and good literature. And don't worry, I'll reserve the most charming corner of the garden, where the wisteria casts just the right dappled shade for reading. How wonderful to think we'll be continuing that grand tradition of salon culture, right here among our roses and books. I do believe Jane Austen herself would approve of such a delightful scheme!
[A]: How perfectly you've arranged everything - the lavender shortbread is an inspired touch! It reminds me of Elizabeth Bennet's observation that "there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," and yours shines through every detail. Until Thursday then, when we shall blend the fragrance of roses with the music of Austen's prose. I can already imagine the sunlight filtering through the wisteria as we discuss whether Anne Elliot's patience was virtue or folly... What a splendid new chapter we're about to write together in our unconventional university of life. 📚🌹
[B]: Until Thursday, my dear friend! I'll be sure to mark our calendars with a pressed rose - both literal and literary bookmark for this beautiful new chapter. And don't worry, I've already instructed the staff to polish the silver teapot we save for special occasions. After all, as Miss Austen might say, some conversations deserve nothing less than our very best china!
[A]: What exquisite attention to detail - the polished silver teapot is a touch worthy of Lady Catherine de Bourgh's approval! Though I suspect our gathering will be far more congenial than her ladyship's drawing room. Until we meet beneath the wisteria, I shall be rereading "Persuasion" with fresh eyes, imagining how the autumn light will dance upon the pages - and perhaps upon our lavender shortbread as well. Farewell for now, kindred spirit! 🌹
[B]: Goodbye for now, my dear literary friend! I'll leave you with this thought - while Lady Catherine might judge a gathering by its silver, we shall measure ours by the warmth of its conversations and the sweetness of shared discoveries. Safe travels until Thursday, and may your rereading uncover new delights to share beneath our wisteria bower!
[A]: What a perfectly measured benediction to our conversation! You've distilled the very essence of what makes both great literature and true hospitality - that alchemy which transforms silver and china into something far more precious: human connection. Until we raise our teacups in toast to Austen and autumn afternoons, I remain your devoted fellow seeker of life's beautiful intersections between books and roses. Farewell! 📚🌹
[B]: Farewell, my dear friend! Though our salon hasn't yet begun, I feel we've already composed its most perfect prologue right here. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go consult with our gardener about those wisteria blossoms - we wouldn't want our literary canopy to be anything less than worthy of Austen's prose, would we? Until Thursday!
