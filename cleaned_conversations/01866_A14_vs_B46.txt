[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a debate, isn't it? I've worked with some brilliant minds who never finished college—and some who carry their diploma like a holy scripture. But let me tell you something...  

I met this young director last year, self-taught, raw energy— vision, really. He didn’t know half the technical jargon we throw around on set, but he  the story in his bones. That’s priceless.

Still… there’s something about discipline. College teaches you structure, how to collaborate, and sometimes—let’s be honest—it opens doors you couldn’t reach alone.  

But hey, if someone’s got drive and can learn through other paths, maybe the degree isn’t the only way anymore. What do you think?
[A]: 哇，你这个话题真的超有共鸣诶！✨ 我每天帮客人安排行程的时候，也常遇到各种背景的人。说真的，我觉得现在degree就像一个工具——用得好能帮你走得更稳，但不是唯一出路。

我前两天刚服务过一位guest，她是个超酷的UI designer，完全自学成才，还带出了自己的team！但她也老实说：“如果当初没读design school，可能连第一份实习机会都拿不到。” 💭

你知道吗？我们酒店最近在招intern，收到好多简历。有些名校出来的同学确实基础扎实，但也有几位靠自己做project脱颖而出的candidate，让我眼前一亮！💯

所以嘛… 就像你说的那个导演，才华和热情真的很珍贵。不过要是能两者兼得，不是更好吗？既有学院派的底蕴，又有实战派的灵活～你觉得呢？🤔
[B]: You hit the nail on the head. It’s not —it’s about finding the right blend. Like a great film, it's all in how you mix the elements.

I remember working with this screenwriter who went to NYU, top of her class, knew every rule of three-act structure by heart—but when she first started, her dialogue sounded like it came straight out of a textbook. Then she spent a year writing for a web series, got her hands dirty, and boom! Suddenly her scripts had that —that raw edge that makes people lean forward in their seats.

So yeah, schools teach you the craft, but hustle teaches you the business. And in today’s world? You need both to survive. That UI designer you met—sounds like she learned how to speak the language  she already thought in pictures. Powerful combo.

I’ll tell you one thing: if I see an intern who’s built real projects, even without the diploma… I’ll give them a shot. Because at the end of the day, I’m not investing in a piece of paper—I’m investing in someone who knows how to tell a story, and make it .
[A]: 完全同意！👏 就像我们酒店的行政总厨常说：“菜谱能教你火候，但教不会你对食材的敬畏。” 最厉害的人都是把学院派和实战派揉在一起的～既有底子，又有灵气。

说到这个让我想起上个月有位guest，是个年轻的游戏开发者。他一边在读CS硕士，一边和朋友做独立游戏。他说读书是为了解底层逻辑，但做项目才能让他“听到玩家的心跳”。😂 听得我都想下载他们的游戏来玩！

其实吧，不管是拍电影、写代码还是做服务行业，最打动人的永远是那份“让人想靠近”的热情。Degree可能是敲门砖，但进到门之后，靠的是你能带来什么温度。💌

诶，既然你提到投资intern，我好奇你在选人的时候还有什么“看一眼就觉得对了”的小细节吗？👀
[B]: Oh, absolutely — that ? You can’t fake it.  

One thing I look for? How they talk about their failures. Not just the “I learned from it” line — anyone can say that. I want to hear how it , how it kept them up at night… and why they still showed up the next morning. That’s when I know this person isn’t just chasing success — they’re in love with the .  

And another thing — do they ask good questions? Not “how do I get your job,” but “what did you get wrong the first time?” or “who was the toughest critic you ever had?” Those are the ones who aren’t just looking for shortcuts — they’re trying to understand the .  

Kind of like that game developer you mentioned — he's not just coding, he's listening. And that? That’s rare.  

So tell me, in your world — what little thing makes you think, “this person’s going places”?
[A]: 太有共鸣了… 那种“咬得住疼痛”的人真的自带光芒！🌟 

说到这个，我立马想到昨天有个小细节——有位实习生在处理客诉时被骂哭了，但五分钟后擦干眼泪继续跟进客人需求。后来她悄悄问我：“Emma姐，你会怎么处理这种委屈？” 我说：“把情绪当行李寄存，专业才是通行证。” 她点点头，眼里那种想把事情做好的光… 💯 真的比任何简历都动人。

还有个判断标准：他们会不会“多看一步”？比如给客人递伞的时候，顺手问一句“需要帮忙叫车吗？”；送room service的时候，留意今天是客人太太的生日… 🎉  
这些不是培训能教出来的，是一种本能的服务心——就像你说的那种process-lover，他们就是忍不住想做得更好。

所以咯，我觉得“会感受、肯承担、爱琢磨”，这三个点只要有一点发光，这个人绝对值得 invest～  
你有没有遇过那种一开始不起眼，但慢慢惊艳全场的intern？👀
[B]: Oh, I love that. You just described the heart of any great storyteller — or filmmaker. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about being , even when it hurts.

And yes — I once hired a kid who barely spoke during the first week. Shy, nervous, kept to himself. But I noticed something — every time we had a table read, he wasn’t just taking notes. He was  emotions. Later, I found out he’d been quietly creating visual mood boards for each character — pulling textures, lighting references, even music. No one asked him to. He just .  

That’s when I knew — this guy wasn’t just observing. He was   

I ended up giving him more responsibility, and within months, he was shaping scenes in ways some senior producers hadn’t even considered. All because he saw what others .  

Sounds like you’ve got a nose for those kinds of people too. That “look further” instinct? Priceless. 🎬

So… if you  to pick — would you say the future belongs to the curious, or to the resilient? Or maybe… the rare ones who are both?
[A]: 呜哇…这个问题好深啊！🤔  
让我想起酒店大堂那盏水晶灯——光有好奇心就像只开了轮廓灯，Resilience才是点亮每一颗水晶的光源。但要我说，真正厉害的人都是“好奇+坚韧”的双声道模式！🎧

就像你说的那个intern，他的好奇心让他看到别人忽略的细节，但那份坚持让他能把想法落地成真。这种人就像慢火炖汤，越熬越香～  

不过啦，如果非要二选一… 我可能会偷懒选“both” 🙈 因为这个世界变化太快了，没有好奇心会迷路，缺少韧性会摔跤。能一边探索一边爬起来继续走的人，才是时代的主旋律呀！

你觉得呢？是不是也偷偷想选“both”？😉
[B]: Oh, you caught me — I’m absolutely team .  

Curiosity is the compass. Resilience is the boots on the ground. Take one without the other and you’re either spinning in circles or walking blindfolded.  

I’ve seen it on set — the ones who keep going, not because they’re fearless, but because their curiosity burns brighter than their doubt. They fall, sure. Hell, they might even curse a little. But then they lean in and ask, “Okay… what just happened? And how do I make it work ?”  

That’s the real secret sauce — not talent, not luck. It’s that refusal to stop  while you’re picking yourself up.  

So yeah… if the future had a casting call, I think that’s what it’d say:  
“Seekers wanted. Must endure storms. Must carry their own light.” 🎥  

And honestly? Sounds like you’re already surrounded by them.
[A]: 说得我心脏都跳快了！💓 你这句"carry their own light"简直绝了——就像我们酒店那些凌晨四点还在准备早餐摆盘的厨师，明明没人看见，但就是忍不住想把食物摆得漂亮一点再漂亮一点。

你知道吗？我现在每天巡岗的时候都会特意看两眼那个水晶灯 💫 突然觉得它每一面都在讲不同的故事：有的折射出好奇心的光，有的映着坚持的影子… 但合起来才成就了整座大厅的温度。

或许这就是为什么我喜欢这份工作——不是因为五星级酒店的光环，而是因为在这里总能遇见一群“自带光源”的人。他们可能是顶着暴雨送客人去机场的司机，也可能是通宵调试灯光的活动策划… 每个人都在用自己的方式诠释什么是“burning bright”。

诶，听你聊这么多电影幕后的故事，我都开始好奇… 你最近在筹备的新项目也是这种“双声道”团队吗？👀
[B]: Oh, you just touched on something so real — those quiet moments when people , even when no one’s watching. That’s where the magic lives.

And yeah… my next project? You could call it a “双声道” production. We’ve got this young writer who’s fresh out of film school — book-smart, hungry, asks questions that make me rethink scenes I’ve already locked in editing. And then there’s our gaffer, this old-school guy who’s been lighting sets since before LED existed. He doesn’t tweet or read theory, but he  light like a musician feels rhythm.

At first, they couldn’t be more different. But last week, I walked onto set and saw them standing together under a rig, just talking — really . The writer was asking how to create a shadow that “haunts but doesn’t scare,” and the gaffer was sketching shapes in the air with his hands.  

That’s the kind of moment I live for. When curiosity meets craft. When someone’s hunger meets someone else’s wisdom.  

I guess every scene we shoot from now on will carry  of their lights. And honestly? That’s all I want — a story that glows from the inside out. 🎥✨
[A]: 呜～光是听你描述我都起鸡皮疙瘩了！ goosebumps everywhere 🥺 那种“新旧碰撞”的火花真的太迷人了，就像我们酒店的行政酒廊——一边是百年历史的雕花天花板，一边是悬浮玻璃杯架的现代设计，但奇妙的是它们居然彼此成就！

我觉得最棒的创作就是这种“双声道”的共鸣——年轻人带着打破常规的勇气，老师傅握着岁月沉淀的手感。你说那个gaffer用手在空中画光影的样子，简直像在跳一支光之舞… 💃

说到这个，我突然好想看这部戏的成片啊！如果有机会的话，要不要考虑来我们酒店办一次read-through？我知道顶层的宴会厅最近有档期 😏 保证给你们配上最能衬托故事温度的灯光和茶点～

不过先说好——我要reserved第一排最中间的位置！毕竟这种“从内而外发光”的故事，值得最好的view呀 💯
[B]: Now  — that’s the kind of pitch I live for. You just sold me on a read-through without even needing a budget proposal.  

I love the idea — a space where old-world elegance meets modern soul? That’s exactly the vibe of this project. Imagine reading the script under those vaulted ceilings, glasses of something aged quietly in the background, and that floating glass energy you mentioned… perfect contrast. Perfect harmony.

And hey — if I pull this off, you’re getting first dibs on the front row. Deal? Maybe I’ll even have the gaffer bring his favorite old-school lantern for ambiance. Call it a little nod to the magic we’ve been talking about.

So… when are we doing this? Let’s make it happen. 🎬✨
[A]: Deal！💯 你这句话让我觉得明天的晨会突然变得超有盼头～我已经开始脑补宴会厅的布置了：古董烛台旁放几盏工业风LED灯，再让甜品主厨做个“光影渐变”的蛋糕… 哈哈，是不是有点over了？😂

说到这个项目氛围，我觉得你们剧组真的该来体验下我们的"午夜花园"套房。里面有面墙是用200年历史的木雕和光纤灯光结合的设计，每次带客人参观的时候都觉得像是走进了一个会呼吸的故事里 🌿✨

不过在定日期前，我超级想问——这部戏的核心故事到底是什么？毕竟要配出对的灯光和音乐，我得先抓住它的灵魂呀～👀
[B]: Oh, I love how your mind works — you’re not just setting a scene, you’re .  

As for the story… let me put it this way — it’s about a sound designer who starts hearing something  the noises of the city. A frequency that no one else seems to notice. At first, he thinks it’s madness. But then he realizes… it’s a voice. Maybe memory. Maybe the future. Maybe both.

It’s a love letter to anyone who’s ever listened deeper than others thought necessary.

So yeah — moody, introspective, with moments of quiet explosion. Think flickers, not floods. The kind of film where silence speaks louder than dialogue. And the whole thing? It hums with this slow, hypnotic rhythm — like walking through a dream that feels too familiar.

Now tell me… what kind of light would  need? 😏
[A]: Wow… just… wow 🌌 你说的每一句都像掉进我心里去了。这不就是我们每天在酒店上演的故事吗？那些看似平常的瞬间里，藏着多少别人没听见的“心跳声”啊…

我觉得灯光要像呼吸一样自然～主区用暖黄光带营造城市夜色，但角落里藏着几束游移的蓝调，就像主角听到的那个神秘频率 💭 客人休息区干脆做成声音装置艺术——放几个老式录音机循环播放城市白噪音，谁想听都可以按下play键。

甜品的话！我已经有个疯狂想法：做个“声波蛋糕”🎂 表面是镜面巧克力，上面用可食用金粉画出声波图谱，切开里面是渐变的灰蓝色果仁层… 就像你说的那种“安静地爆炸”的感觉！

对了，你那个主角听到的声音…会不会刚好和我们大堂钢琴的某个琴键共振？😂 每天凌晨三点，整栋楼都会有一种奇特的回响，连最资深的调音师都说不清来源… 要不要来采个样？说不定这就是你要找的“voice of memory”呢？👀
[B]: You, my friend, are  in the best way possible. I can already see it — that hotel of yours becoming more than a venue. It becomes a .  

The breathing light, the hidden frequencies in plain sight — hell, even that sound-reactive cake? Genius. You’re not just setting a mood, you’re   

And that piano resonance at 3 a.m.? That’s not background noise — that’s the universe whispering through the keys. I’d be a fool not to capture that. Maybe we’ll bring in a contact from the studio — a field recordist who once captured wind passing through an abandoned tunnel in Prague and turned it into a score. He’s all about those .

So tell me…  
If this film had a scent — something guests would smell as they walked in — what would it be?  
Just curious. You know, for the final layer of dream. 😏
[A]: 危险？哈，你这句话我要裱起来挂在办公室了！😏  

如果要说scent…我会选那种“雨后老书店”的味道 🌧️📚——混合着潮湿的木头香、旧纸张的温柔，还有那么一丢丢金属烛台的冷冽。不是喷香水的那种香，而是一种“被记忆浸透”的气息。

你知道吗？我们酒店地下一层有间不对外开放的藏书阁，里面全是上世纪的旅行日记和戏票存根。每次开门进去找古董postcard给客人当纪念品时，那股味道就像突然掉进某个人的往事里…

要不要这样搞：在read-through现场放几个铜制香薰炉，用雪松木做基底，再悄悄加一点录音带磁粉烧焦的味道？既呼应主角听到的frequency，又像一场气味版的蒙太奇…✨

怎么样，这个想法够不够“dangerous”？👀
[B]: Oh, now  — that’s not just a scent. That’s time travel in a bottle.  

I can already smell it — the damp soul of old pages whispering secrets, the warmth of wood that’s soaked up decades of stories, and that hint of burnt magnetic tape… like forgotten voices trying to speak through the static.  

You’re not just building atmosphere — you’re crafting a . And I  it.  

Hell, let’s go further — what if we sneak in a few vintage books wrapped in velvet, left casually on tables? No labels, no explanations. Just let people pick them up, flip through, maybe find a line underlined in pencil from fifty years ago.  

You’re making this film come alive before we’ve even shot a frame.  
And honestly? I think your hotel might just steal my heart before this is over. 🎬🕯️
