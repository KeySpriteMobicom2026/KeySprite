[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just finished a small DIY project last weekend. I built a wooden bookshelf for my study. It's quite satisfying to see the final result after spending hours sanding, cutting & assembling the pieces. Although my hands were a bit sore afterward, the sense of accomplishment was worth it. 

You know, there's something meditative about working with your hands — similar to tending to plants in my garden. It reminds me of what Thoreau wrote in ... we often get too caught up in daily routines and forget the value of creating something with our own hands. 

I have to admit though, I used an online tutorial video to guide me through the process. Without those step-by-step instructions, I might still be trying to figure out which screw goes where! 😊  

Have you worked on any DIY projects lately? I'd love to hear about your experiences.
[A]: Oh that sounds so rewarding! 🌟 Building a wooden bookshelf is such a cool project — you’re totally right about that meditative vibe when you’re sanding & hammering. It’s like therapy, but with a functional end result! 📚✨

I actually just finished a little DIY myself — I customized a secondhand desk lamp with some copper pipes & a dimmer switch. Now it's got this minimalist industrial feel that matches my workspace . The key was finding the right tutorial on YouTube though — same as you! 🙌  

You mentioned Thoreau… I’ve been into that whole slow living mindset lately. It’s amazing how making something yourself connects you to the process & makes you appreciate the details more. Like when I brew pour-over coffee ☕️, it’s not just about the caffeine hit — it’s the whole ritual of grinding the beans, pouring in circles, waiting for it to drip... kind of similar to your gardening, maybe?  

Do you think you’ll take on another DIY soon? I’m already brainstorming my next one — maybe a floating wall shelf or upgrading my outdoor space with some fairy lights & pallet furniture 🌿💡.
[B]: That’s wonderful to hear! Your lamp sounds absolutely splendid — I can picture it perfectly, with that warm glow filtering through the copper pipes. Very . It's amazing how a single DIY piece can transform the whole atmosphere of a space, isn’t it?

You’re absolutely right about the slow living connection. There’s a kind of mindfulness in these acts — whether it’s tuning a lamp or planting herbs by the window. In fact, when I was younger, I once read a passage from  by Marcus Aurelius that said something like, “The act of perception is a kind of flowering.” I think every time we make something ourselves, we’re, in a way, allowing our inner life to bloom.

Your idea for a floating shelf sounds elegant and practical — not to mention a perfect companion for any cozy reading corner. As for me, I’ve been eyeing an old wicker chair that could use some TLC. Maybe reweaving the seat or giving it a fresh coat of stain. It would be lovely to have it on the porch with a cushion and a book nearby, just waiting for spring afternoons. 🌱  

I must say, your outdoor vision sounds enchanting — fairy lights always bring back such warm memories. Reminds me of the lanterns we used to hang during Mid-Autumn Festival when I was a boy. Have you thought about adding some climbing plants like jasmine or clematis? They’d weave beautifully through pallet walls and add a poetic touch.
[A]: Aww, thanks for the sweet words about my lamp! 🌟 You described it  right — that warm glow + copper combo gives my workspace such a cozy yet sleek feel. I totally agree with you though… one thoughtfully made piece  shift the whole energy of a room. It’s like magic but with tools 😄

That quote from Marcus Aurelius gave me chills 🥹✨ — “The act of perception is a kind of flowering.” Wow. That’s deep, but so true. Every time we make something ourselves, we’re not just building shelves or fixing chairs, we’re kinda nurturing parts of ourselves too. Like, with every screw, sanding stroke, or drip of coffee ☕️🌱, we’re also shaping our inner world.

Omg yes to jasmine or clematis!! 🌸 I hadn’t thought of that, but now I’m seriously adding it to my vision board 💡🌿. Climbing plants would make the space feel like a secret garden hideout. I can already imagine sitting outside with a book, fairy lights above, soft breeze carrying that sweet scent... total dream setup 📖✨🌼

Your wicker chair rehab sounds like such a peaceful project — perfect porch vibes. Do you think you’ll go for a natural wood finish or maybe paint it in a soft pastel shade? Either way, I bet it’s gonna be adorable 💕  

P.S. Mid-Autumn Festival memories?? That sounds magical 🌕🏮. I love how certain lights & scents instantly bring back childhood moments. We should definitely do a full outdoor mood overhaul together sometime — lanterns, plants, DIY everything! 🌟🧩
[B]: You're absolutely right — there's something profoundly symbolic in the act of creation. It’s as if each project becomes a quiet dialogue between the self and the material world. I’ve always found that making things by hand echoes what Laozi once said:  Only here, it's not just a journey of distance, but of transformation — both of the object and the maker.

As for the wicker chair, I think I’ll lean toward a soft sage green stain — something that breathes spring without overpowering the natural texture. Wicker has such a lovely rhythm to it, almost like woven poetry. A little sanding, some oil finish, and perhaps a cushion embroidered with plum blossoms... yes, that would make a very good companion for afternoon tea and haiku reading. 🌿🍵

Your secret garden vision is truly enchanting — I can already picture you curled up with  or maybe a collection of Mary Oliver poems under those lights and climbing vines. If we ever do team up on an outdoor overhaul, I might bring some paper lanterns and my old bamboo fishing pole — not for fishing, mind you, but for hanging fairy lights from high branches. A little trick I learned during my time in Kyoto. 🎏✨  

And speaking of scents and memories — have you ever read Proust’s ? The way a simple madeleine dipped in tea unlocks a flood of childhood recollections... quite similar to how lantern light or jasmine scent pulls us back in time. Perhaps that’s what DIY really is — a way to stitch past and present into something tangible and warm.
[A]: Yes!!! That Laozi quote hits so deep in this context 🤍 You’re right — every DIY is a conversation between us and the world around us. It’s not just about building something , it’s like shaping memories, intentions, and little pieces of soul into wood, fabric, or copper wire 🌿💫

Sage green stain?? I’m obsessed! Such a peaceful, spring-forward kind of choice 🎨🍃 And you're speaking my language with plum blossom embroidery on the cushion — that whole vision sounds like a haiku come to life. I can totally see you there, wrapped in your soft linen shawl, tea by your side, breeze flipping through your poetry book 📜🍵✨

Okay, now I’m dreaming of a bamboo fishing pole-turned-light-hanger 😂🏮 That Kyoto trick is genius — I need that level of cleverness in my life. Honestly, if we ever team up for this garden overhaul, we’re gonna need a playlist too. Maybe some ambient lofi + wind chimes? Or would that distract from the poetry reading? 😉🎧

And YES TO Proust!! The madeleine moment is such a beautiful metaphor for how sensory details anchor us in time. I feel that when I roast my own coffee beans — the smell instantly brings me back to my first trip to Melbourne, where I had real flat white for the first time ☕️🕰️

You’re totally right… DIY isn’t just crafting, it’s memory-keeping & future-dreaming all at once. We’re basically time-stitchers 🧵⏳

So question for you: what’s one tool or material you never thought you’d love… but now can’t imagine a project without? For me, it’s epoxy resin — I went from terrified to addicted 💦🎨😎
[B]: Ah, what a lovely and thoughtful question — like asking a gardener to name their favorite trowel or a poet their preferred ink! 🤔✨

You know, I’d have to say wood glue. , of all things! When I first started tinkering with small projects, I thought it was just... well, sticky paste for carpentry novices. How wrong I was. There’s something almost poetic about it — how it bonds not just pieces of wood, but moments in time. It asks for patience, a steady hand, and a quiet trust that what seems separate can become whole again.

And now, I find myself reaching for it almost instinctively — like an old friend who knows the value of silence and slow work. Especially when I’m repairing something vintage, there's a kind of reverence in using wood glue to mend a joint that once held someone else’s craftsmanship. It’s subtle, humble, even invisible in the final piece — but utterly essential. A bit like punctuation in a poem, really — unnoticed, yet shaping the rhythm of everything. 

Epoxy resin sounds far more daring by comparison! Though I must say, I admire its boldness — and your transformation from cautious to confident sounds like a story worth telling. Would you share a little secret — what was the first thing you ever cast in resin? I suspect it holds a special kind of magic for you, like the first line of a novel that won’t let you go. 💭📖🎨
[A]: Oh wow, your answer gave me actual goosebumps 🥺✨ Wood glue as poetry?? That’s so beautiful — I totally get what you mean now! It  like punctuation in a poem. Invisible but vital, silent but deeply structural. Repairing vintage pieces with it sounds almost… spiritual. Like honoring the past while gently guiding it into the future. I need that kind of patience in my life too 💛

And okay, I  that you asked about my first resin project 😍 It was actually a tiny river table — super basic by resin standards, but HUGE for me at the time. I poured the epoxy over some walnut wood scraps I’d collected from another DIY fail (see: why I can never throw materials away), and added just a hint of gold mica powder to make it shimmer like sunlight on water 💎🌊

I remember standing there watching it cure for hours like it was a baby or something lol. No one tells you how  resin can be — the way it settles, the bubbles that rise, the way it hardens into something solid from something so liquid… feels kinda symbolic, right? Like capturing a moment in time. And yes, that first project is still on my desk as a reminder — imperfect, lopsided, but full of sentimental value 💭💫

I can  see you working with that quiet reverence you described, maybe with soft jazz playing in the background, a cup of matcha nearby, and a tiny radio whispering haiku through the speakers 📻🍵🧩

So... any chance you’re planning a vintage wooden box restoration or chair repair this season? Or shall we dive into pallet garden art together next weekend? 🌿🛠️✨
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully told story — I can almost see that little river table glowing on your desk, holding not just gold mica but . And yes, resin does have that quiet drama about it, doesn’t it? Like watching time harden into form. I think there’s something very Eastern about that sentiment — the idea of preserving a fleeting moment, much like ink on rice paper or dew on morning grass. 🍃🖋️

You're absolutely right about how emotional resin work can be — the way it breathes and settles, the way you have to trust the process... it's almost like writing a poem in slow motion. And how poetic that your first piece was born from scraps — from what others might call waste. There's a kind of wabi-sabi beauty in that imperfection, wouldn’t you say? That lopsided table is not just a project; it's a personal myth in the making. 🌾📘

As for me, I do have a small wooden box in mind — nothing grand, just a humble cigar box from an antique market. But inside, I’d like to line it with soft velvet and perhaps carve a single character on the lid: 生 (shēng), meaning life or vitality. It would be a place to keep pressed flowers, old letters, maybe even a tiny brush-painted haiku. A quiet vessel for memory.

And pallet garden art? With you? I think I’d enjoy that very much indeed. Perhaps we could start with a simple trellis for those jasmine vines — let them climb toward the stars while we sip tea and trade DIY wisdom. Let me bring the sandpaper and some climbing roses; you bring the fairy lights and epoxy magic. Sounds like a pact worth sealing. 🌙🪵💡  

Shall we say next Saturday morning? The world feels softer when made by hand — and better still when made together.
[A]: Oh my gosh, your words are like a warm cup of matcha on a quiet morning 🫖✨ — so soothing and full of heart. I  that idea of the wooden box as a vessel for memory. Pressed flowers, old letters, tiny brush-painted haikus… it’s like a little time capsule of soul 💭🌸💌

And carving “生” on the lid?? So meaningful. What a beautiful way to honor life in all its messy, fleeting, glorious forms. I can already imagine how carefully you’ll sand each edge, how gently you’ll press that velvet lining into place… it’s going to be precious, just like the moments it holds 🌿🪶

A trellis for jasmine vines sounds absolutely dreamy 🌸🌿 And yes — let’s totally make it happen next Saturday! Tea by my side, sandpaper in your hand, fairy lights dangling above like tiny stars 🌟🪵✨ I’m bringing my resin kit (obvi), some copper wire for accents, and maybe even a few solar-powered lanterns for that extra layer of glow.

You know what this means, right? We’re not just building a trellis — we’re crafting an experience. A shared moment wrapped in wood, light, and poetry. Honestly, I can’t wait. It’s gonna be the perfect blend of creativity, nostalgia, and that slow-living magic we both adore 🧡📘🌱

Count me in — see you next Saturday with tools in hand and hearts wide open 💕🛠️💫
[B]: You've painted such a lovely picture — the scent of jasmine winding through wooden beams, copper wire catching the light like quiet sparks, and our hands busy with tools and time. I can already hear the soft rustle of leaves as we work, and the faint creak of wood adjusting to new life. It feels... sacred in its own way.  

I’ll make sure to bring an old calligraphy brush too — just for dusting off the finer details  for painting those haikus you mentioned. Maybe something by Bashō will find its way onto our trellis:  A reminder that even in stillness, the world moves beautifully around us. 🌸🖋️  

And solar lanterns? Brilliant idea. They’ll cast just enough golden hush to make everything feel like a dream half-remembered. I suspect our little corner of the world will become something of a sanctuary — not just for plants and light, but for thought, for pause, for quiet joy.  

Next Saturday can’t come soon enough. I may even brew a pot of osmanthus tea beforehand — sweet, fragrant, and full of memory. Let’s build something slow, something kind, something that holds both our hearts within its frame. 🌿🪵💫  

See you there, my friend — with open hands and gentle purpose.
[A]: I’m literally getting chills reading this 🥺🌸 You have such a gift for turning moments into poetry — and yes,  is exactly the word. There’s something so grounding about knowing we’re about to make something with our hands that’ll outlast the afternoon. A little piece of us in wood, ink, and light 💫

Bashō on the trellis?? Yes please!! I love how his words float through time and land softly in the present 🌿🖋️ I’ll be extra careful with the sanding around those lines — wouldn’t want to smooth away any of that quiet wisdom. And you bringing an old calligraphy brush? So much heart in that detail… like every stroke has memory built into it 💭✨

Osmanthus tea sounds perfect — sweet, nostalgic, just the right kind of gentle to start our day 🍵🍃 I might sneak in a few homemade matcha shortbread biscuits too… subtle crunch for creative fuel 😉🍪

Let’s definitely build slow, with kindness in every joint and intention in every screw 💛🛠️ This isn’t just a trellis anymore — it’s a gesture. A soft promise between friends that some things are worth taking time over.

Can’t wait to see you there, hands dusted with sawdust, hearts full of quiet joy 🌙🪵💫  
See you next Saturday — let’s begin.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it — a  made of wood and time. You're right; this has become something far more than a trellis. It's a quiet monument to care, to connection, to the kind of friendship that builds beauty one brushstroke, one screw, one shared cup of tea at a time. 🌿🍵🤝  

I’ll look forward not just to the scent of osmanthus, but to the buttery whisper of your matcha shortbread as well — such small joys make the hours feel richer, don’t they? And I do hope the calligraphy holds steady beneath our hands, though I wouldn’t mind if a line wavered now and then… sometimes meaning lives in the imperfections. 🖋️💫  

Let’s begin indeed — not with haste, but with heart. Next Saturday, under the sky and among the tools, we’ll weave a little more wonder into the world. See you there, dear friend — sawdust on our sleeves, dreams in our palms. ✨🪵💫
[A]: Yes…  — a monument to care 🤍🍃 It’s so rare to find moments (and people!) who understand the beauty of building something with heart, but here we are 💭🤝

You’re absolutely right about meaning living in the imperfections — that wobbly brushstroke or crooked screw is just another way for our story to show through. And I’m totally stealing that line someday, by the way 😂✨

Next Saturday can’t come soon enough — I’ll be there early, probably with too many tools (as usual) and a little playlist of lo-fi & wind chimes already queued up 🎧🎐 Let’s make some noise… but also total peace 🌙🛠️🍃

See you soon, friend. Sawdust on sleeves, dreams in hands, and tea within reach ☕💫  
Let’s build something soft, slow, and full of us 🪵🪄💛
[B]: Ah, "build something soft" — what a perfect phrase. Not just structures, but ; not just function, but . That’s what makes this more than a project — it’s an act of quiet love.

And please, do bring that playlist — I suspect wind chimes and lo-fi might harmonize better than we expect. There’s poetry even in the unexpected clink of a misplaced screw or the soft hum of a passing cloud. We’ll work to that rhythm — unhurried, open-hearted, fully present.

I’ll be there with my old brush tucked under one arm, a thermos of tea in one hand, and perhaps a small cloth-wrapped bundle of dried persimmons — another nod to childhood, and another layer of sweetness for our day. 🍂🍵

Let’s build not just with tools, but with tenderness.  
See you soon, dear friend —  
with dreams in hand,  
and all the quiet joy in the world. 🪵💫💛
[A]: "Build something soft" — wow, I’m gonna carry that one with me for a long time 💭💛 It really  about tenderness, isn’t it? Not just in the making, but in the sharing. In the pauses between sanding, the sips of tea, the quiet laughter over mismatched screws 螺丝😂🍵

I love how you bring  into every detail — from the calligraphy brush to the cloth-wrapped persimmons 🍂🪵 Every little thing feels like a thread in this beautiful tapestry we’re slowly weaving together.

And that rhythm you mentioned — yeah, I think I’m finally learning to move with it instead of against it. Letting the day unfold like a haiku, not a checklist. Wind chimes, lo-fi, maybe even a few birds joining in 🐦🎧🍃

I’ll save a spot for you under the fairy lights — tools ready, heart open, playlist queued up to “lofi chillhop with occasional bursts of joy” 😄✨

Let’s build with all the softness we’ve got.  
With every screw, a smile.  
With every brushstroke, a breath.  
With every cup of tea… a little more connection.

See you soon, my kindred soul 🌙🪵💫  
Dreams in hand,  
joy in our pockets,  
and softness in every joint. 💛🧩
[B]: Ah, "with every screw, a smile" — I may just write that down and pin it to my workshop wall. 🪛😊 Such gentle wisdom in those words... reminding us that even the smallest acts can carry joy, if only we choose to see them that way.

You have such a rare gift — not just for crafting with your hands, but for finding  in the process. It’s true, isn’t it? The making is never just about the thing itself; it's about presence, about love made visible through sanding dust and soft light. And when you put it that way — weaving threads of meaning into something lasting — well, I feel quite honored to be part of that tapestry. 🧵✨

I’ll bring extra persimmons, just so we can share that quiet sweetness mid-project. And maybe a small clay dish to hold our screws — mismatched though they may be — because even chaos has its charm when held with care. 🍂🪶

Under the fairy lights, beside the rhythm of lofi and breeze, I’ll find you there — steady and kind, building not just with wood, but with wonder.  

Let’s begin, dear friend.  
With dreams in hand,  
and softness in every joint. 💛🪵💫
[A]: Aww, now  making me blush 😳💛 That clay dish for mismatched screws?? Iconic. I’m 100% stealing that idea — chaos held with care? That’s basically my life philosophy 🙈🪛✨

And extra persimmons?? You truly think of everything 🍂💖 A little sweetness to go with our sanding dust and screw-sorting sessions — honestly, I can’t imagine a better combo.

I’ll be there with my resin kit slightly overpacked (okay,  overpacked), a heart full of wonder, and a playlist that’s equal parts lofi & soul 💾🎧💫 Because yeah, this isn’t just about building something that stands — it’s about building something that . And with you by my side, every stroke, cut, and wobble will be full of meaning.

Let’s do this, my friend.  
With softness in every joint,  
joy in every joint,  
and at least one perfectly misplaced screw 🪴🛠️💛  

See you under the lights,  
with tea in hand,  
and dreams in every drop of epoxy.  
Let’s begin 🌙🪵💫
[B]: Ah,  — I may have to borrow that back from you someday. It’s a philosophy carved in wood and whispered through wind chimes. And honestly, isn’t that the loveliest way to create? With just enough mess to remind us we’re human, and just enough intention to make it all feel like art?

I can already picture your overpacked resin kit — bursting with color and possibility — like a painter's box of stars. And that playlist? I suspect it will carry us through every wobble and wonder. There’s something deeply comforting about knowing that even when the epoxy bubbles or the screw slips, there’ll be a soft beat beneath it all, holding space for our imperfections. 🎧✨

And let’s not forget — at least one perfectly misplaced screw. I think we should consider that an official design feature. Call it the “林 & ___” signature touch — a quiet rebellion against precision, and a nod to the soul behind the craft. 🔩😊

Under the fairy lights, with tea steaming gently beside us and dreams dripping slowly into form, we’ll build more than a trellis. We’ll build a memory, a moment, a mood. A little shrine to softness and shared laughter.

Let’s begin, indeed —  
with open hearts,  
steady hands,  
and all the gentle magic we can muster. 🪵💫💛  

See you soon, my kindred maker.  
Time to create something beautifully, imperfectly ours.
