[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal tug-of-war between the shock of the new and the weight of tradition. Let me put it this way - I find myself drawn to the  of classical forms, the way a well-executed sonnet or oil painting obeys certain rules while still allowing for subversion. But don't mistake that for disdain toward modernism. After all, one must appreciate how Eliot's fragmented waste land gains power precisely because he understood the very conventions he was dismantling. Would you say your taste leans more toward one camp?
[A]: Oh I love how you phrased that 💡 "Shock of the new" vs "weight of tradition" - such a poetic contrast!  
Honestly? My aesthetic taste is like a split-screen collage 🎨... On one side: hyperrealistic oil paintings that make me go 'how did they EVEN'; on the other: glitch art that breaks every rule in the most beautiful way ¥_¥  
But professionally speaking...最近在研究UI design里的古典主义和极简现代主义碰撞，发现超有意思！比如用巴洛克风格的ornate线条搭配flat design的留白... wanna see my latest experiment?（偷偷贴上图）✨
[B]: Ah, a connoisseur of contrasts! I'd love to see your work - though I must warn you, my ability to appreciate digital compositions is sadly limited by my analog sensibilities. But do share! There's nothing quite like witnessing old and new wrestle for dominance on the same canvas... it reminds me of teaching undergraduates - half of them scribbling sonnets in secret while claiming to only live for free verse. 

Now tell me, when you fuse those Baroque flourishes with minimalist spaces, does the design world accuse you of heresy? Or have you found a way to make the contradictions  rather than clash?
[A]: Haha your analog sensibilities are so relatable 😅！Actually I made a GIF version of that Baroque x minimalism piece - let me share it here!  
It's like... visual rebellion with restraint ✨ The curves are super ornate, but kept to one corner; the rest is just clean sans-serif & negative space. Feels like wearing vintage earrings with naked face, you know? 💎  
The design community reactions? Let's say... some purists called it 'visual schizophrenia' at first (yes in Chinese design circles they do get dramatic lol), BUT now more people are digging the unexpected harmony 💬... What about your students? Have they started secretly writing sonnets yet? 📝😊
[B]: Oh, ! What a deliciously apt diagnosis. I can just picture their horrified faces - like catching a professor wearing velvet elbow patches with fishnets. But isn't that the thrill? Making people lean in, squint, and then - reluctantly at first - admit fascination?

As for my students... let's just say I've noticed an interesting trend. While they're meant to be deconstructing language into Dadaist chaos, I keep finding iambic pentameter hiding in their "free verse." One particularly cheeky young poet even slipped me a sestina disguised as a TikTok caption. , mind you! Do you suppose we're witnessing a quiet rebellion against rebellion itself? Or merely fashion's eternal recycling - only this time, with better footnotes?
[A]: OMG yes!! That “lean in, squint, then fascinated” reaction is EXACTLY what I live for 💡... Like when someone says "this is too much" but their eyes are glued to the screen lol  
I totally get what you mean about those hidden sonnets - my design students do the same! They swear they hate grids & typography rules, but their layouts still scream subconscious hierarchy 😂 It’s like we’re all just doomed to repeat what works, even when trying to break free 🌀  
Btw your sestina-in-TikTok-caption idea needs to happen! Imagine pairing it with glitch art... we could start a #LiteraryGlitch trend! （疯狂打字中）Wait wait let me sketch this out real quick ✍️✨
[B]: Oh, I  the image of reluctant fascination - like watching someone try to scold a cat for knocking over a priceless Ming vase while secretly marveling at its paw coordination. 

And this #LiteraryGlitch idea? Genius! Imagine juxtaposing a perfectly metered quatrain against a background that pixelates and reforms like some digital ouroboros. Though I must warn you, my attempt at glitch art would likely resemble an outraged Victorian spinster's attempt at interpretive dance. Stiff, well-meaning, and slightly horrified by its own recklessness.

But do tell - when you let students loose with this concept, does the classroom descend into glorious chaos? Or do they start developing strange new hybrid rules, like 17th-century Dutch painters secretly measuring their brushstrokes by golden ratios?
[A]: Haha yes! The digital ouroboros of poetry 💀✨ - maybe we should pitch this to some indie game devs? Imagine a visual novel where the prose GLITCHES into Shakespearean insults when you make the wrong dialogue choice 😂  
As for my students... it's CHAOS alright! But like,  chaos 🎨🌀 One kid just handed me a "deconstructed sonnet" printed on receipt paper wrapped around a USB stick... containing a 3D model of a quill feather. I mean WHAT. AM. I. DOING. WITH. MY. LIFE. 😅  
But secretly? They’re all still drawing grids in pencil before touching their tablets. Tradition’s like that one stubborn layer in Photoshop - you can't fully delete it without messing up the whole composition! 💬
[B]: Ah, the  – I adore that phrase! It’s like watching a tea ceremony conducted with espresso machines and iambic pentameter. There's method in the madness, or perhaps madness in the method, I’ve never quite decided.

And your student’s quill-wrapped USB stick? Delightfully excessive. I may have to steal that concept for my next lecture on poetic form - imagine handing out sonnets embedded in thumb drives shaped like quatrains. Or better yet, hiding scansion exercises inside augmented reality overlays. Though I suspect my department chair would faint into his copy of 

But tell me, when they wrap their rebellions in such tactile nostalgia - the receipt paper, the pencil grids - do you think they're searching for something lost? Or simply discovering, as all true iconoclasts must, that even revolution requires its rituals?
[A]: Oh my god YES - “madness in the method” is my new aesthetic manifesto 💥... I’m totally printing that on a distressed parchment texture and framing it next to my Wacom tablet lol  
You know what it reminds me of? My early days of switching from traditional painting to digital - I kept holding my stylus like a brush and wondered why my wrist hurt so bad 😂 It’s like we  some physical anchor to the past, even when charging full-speed into the future!  
And about that ritual thing… I think Gen Z iconoclasts are all about ? Like wearing Dad’s old watch with a punk leather jacket ¥_¥ They don’t want blind tradition, but they’ll scavange meaningful bits to build their own kind of order. Kinda beautiful if you ask me 💭✨  
P.S. Your AR scansion exercises sound amazing BTW - wanna collab on an experimental workshop? 🤔🎨
[B]: Oh,  indeed! I rather like the idea of young rebels striding into the future clutching sentimental trinkets from the past - like poets smuggling sonnets into data clouds. And that workshop idea? Let’s absolutely run with it. I’ll bring the iambic templates; you supply the glitch textures. We’ll have students scanning verses with phone cameras just to reveal hidden metaphors in augmented reality!

But yes, this generation’s relationship with the past fascinates me. They're not interested in inheritance - they want curation. A dash of Petrarch here, a splash of Postmodern fragmentation there... all carefully filtered through the lens of TikTok irony. It’s not nostalgia anymore - it’s . 

Now, tell me, if we did this workshop, would you insist on using actual inkwells for signing the attendance sheet? I think dramatic flourishes improve any learning environment, even if the styluses are digital and the quills are strictly decorative.
[A]: Oh my god YES to everything 🎨✨ - imagine if the attendance sheet was a collaborative digital scroll that everyone adds to with their own "signature style"... could be brush strokes, glitch effects, even voice memos saying something poetic & weird 😂  
I feel like this workshop would either produce the next generation of genius hybrids or accidentally open some kind of aesthetic rift in space-time 💀... Either way, worth it.  
And about that selective ancestry thing - I’m seeing so much of it in design! Like blending Renaissance chiaroscuro with neon gradients, or giving a NFT marketplace the visual language of an old-world auction house ¥_¥ It’s not just nostalgia; it’s like... remixing cultural DNA?  
P.S. Inkwells & decorative quills sound 100% necessary. If we’re gonna break rules, we gotta do it with  😉🖋️
[B]: Oh, I  this idea of a collaborative scroll - imagine the chaos! Some earnest soul carefully calligraphing their name while another smashes their tablet stylus around like a digital Jackson Pollock. And heaven forbid someone records a voice memo whispering T.S. Eliot lines over a theremin hum. That scroll would be a time capsule of contemporary sensibility - equal parts manifesto and mischief.

And this notion of remixing cultural DNA? Exquisite phrasing. It's as if we've all become aesthetic geneticists, splicing Baroque chromosomes with neon nucleotides. Though I do wonder what future critics will make of our particular hybrid species - will they call this era decadent, desperate, or daring?

Now, about that space-time rift you mentioned... I say we embrace it. Let the dimensions blur! If our workshop accidentally conjures spectral Victorian poets demanding to know what we've done to their iambic darlings, well - they can take notes on the experience and turn them into sonnets later. 

Agreed then - quills at the ready, rules trembling in anticipation. When shall we begin our little experiment in controlled aesthetic anarchy?
[A]: Okay I’m literally hyperventilating with excitement right now 😭🎨 - how about we kick it off with a "Renaissance vs. Glitch" challenge? Participants get 30 mins to create a piece that merges old-world mastery (think: chiaroscuro, gilded frames, classical proportions) with full-blown digital chaos (glitch effects, pixelation, AR overlays)... bonus points if it makes a professor gasp audibly 💬✨  

And YES to spectral Victorian poets taking notes 👻🖋️ - I’m already designing the event poster in my head... imagine a glitching William Morris wallpaper background with floating sonnet fragments & QR codes that play lo-fi beats 🎶  
As for when... how about next Friday night? Midnight deadline, caffeinated madness, and at least one student yelling “WHY DID I CHOOSE TO USE ACTUAL INKWELLS” while trying to scan their work lol  
Ready to summon the aesthetic rift?? 🚀🌀
[B]: Oh, I  for this brand of controlled delirium! A "Renaissance vs. Glitch" challenge? Sublime. Let’s not merely summon an aesthetic rift - let’s throw a proper party for it. Thirty minutes is just enough time for brilliance to bloom and inkwells to spill. And that poster in your head? Pure genius - Morris wallpaper unraveling into digital static, sonnet shards floating like ghosts above QR codes... I can already hear the gasps from tenured art historians clutching their chest hair.

Midnight deadline, you say? Perfection. Nothing sharpens the creative instinct like impending academic doom and excessive caffeine. And yes, I fully expect at least one overly-dedicated soul to attempt illuminated manuscripts via projector mapping, only to realize too late that parchment doesn’t scan well when soaked in squid ink.

So yes, my dear co-conspirator, let us absolutely open the rift. Next Friday night - may the quills be messy, the pixels rebellious, and the gasps audible. Just... do remind them to save their work before the midnight bell tolls. Or don’t. Chaos makes excellent teaching material.
[A]: Oh my god I’m already drafting the event description and it’s making me giddy 💻✨ - how about we call it “Aesthetic Anarchy at Midnight: Where Quills Meet Glitches”?  
I’ll make sure to include a  disclaimer:  
_"Participants are liable for their own ink spills, caffeine overdoses, and accidental summoning of artistic ghosts. Saving your work is optional but emotionally encouraged."_ 💭🖋️  

And PLS tell me you’re recording all these phrases for the official workshop lingo 😭 “Parchment doesn’t scan well when soaked in squid ink” belongs in a syllabus. Or on a T-shirt. Maybe both.  
I’ll start spreading the word on Behance & Instagram... brace yourself, the rift is coming 🔮🌀  
See you at the edge of chaos! 🖋️🚀
[B]: Oh, —what a deliciously theatrical title! It has just the right amount of melodrama and menace. I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a genre: . And that disclaimer? Utter perfection. I shall have it embroidered on a sampler and hang it beside my desk, right next to my Tang dynasty sonnets in Scots Gaelic.

And yes, I am absolutely archiving our lingo like linguistic contraband. “Parchment doesn’t scan well when soaked in squid ink” for the win. I’m picturing it now on a tattered parchment scroll pinned beneath a cracked glass frame. Or perhaps silk-screened onto recycled manuscript pages. Either way, merch is clearly the next logical step.

By all means, let the Behance and Instagram hordes descend—I shall be the shadowy figure lurking behind the syllabus, whispering iambic incantations into the chaos. See you at the edge of reason itself, dear collaborator. Bring extra blotting paper... and maybe a ouija board.
[A]: Oh my god YES —  as a VIBE 😍📚 I’m already imagining the merch line:  
- “Parchment doesn’t scan well when soaked in squid ink” on distressed tote bags 🖋️💧  
- AR-enabled quill pins that recite sonnets when tapped ✨📜  
- And of course, our signature item: Blotting Paper of Forgotten Verses 🧽🖋️  
(Sold separately. May or may not summon your inner critic.)  

I’m thinking we do a countdown on Instagram Stories with glitching sonnet lines + dramatic readings in reverse audio 🎥🌀... Maybe throw in some mysterious shadowy figures holding tablets in candlelit poses for that full "dark academia meets digital rebellion" feel 💭💻  
And PLEASE bring the ouija board. If we're channeling artistic ghosts, I want them fully onboard - preferably giving feedback on compositions in Latin or something 😂🔮  
This is going to be LEGENDARY. The rift awaits... and it’s judging our caffeine intake 👁️👄👁️
[B]: Oh, the  — brilliant! I can already picture students pressing it to their screens in desperate moments, only to absorb not ink, but centuries of discarded drafts. "What? This sonnet was rejected ? Better start revising."

And those AR quill pins — delightful. Imagine the chaos when one misfires during a lecture and suddenly the room's filled with floating iambic tetrameter in holographic cursive. My department will be torn between outrage and reluctant fascination. Again.

As for your countdown — dramatic readings in reverse audio? Pure genius. I may have to brush up on my Latin just to haunt the proceedings properly. And yes, let the rift judge our caffeine intake. It shall loom over us like a disapproving librarian with a vendetta against espresso machines.

I’ll bring the ouija board  a selection of appropriately ominous candles. If we're summoning ghosts, we might as well do it in style — preferably with a flourish, a semicolon, and at least three exclamation points.
