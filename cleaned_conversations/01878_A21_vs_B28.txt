[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个问题真的超值得讨论的🤔 我觉得degree还是important的，but现在更看重的是你的skillset和practical experience啦！就像我最近在LinkedIn上看到好多job postings都写着'degree or equivalent experience'💯
[A]: Ah, the modern obsession with 'skillsets' and 'practicality'...  While I do concede that experience has its merits, let me remind you that a degree - particularly in the humanities - cultivates something far more precious: the ability to discern meaning in the chaos of existence. Much like Browning's dramatic monologues teach us to read between the lines, don't you think?
[B]: 哇塞！你说话好literary啊😂 不过seriously～你说的critical thinking确实超重要❗❗❗但是你看现在很多online courses也能培养这种能力啊～像我最近就在Coursera上学philosophy，professor讲得超棒的🤩 而且还能和global classmates讨论呢🌍
[A]: My dear, comparing a Coursera certificate to the hallowed halls of academia is like mistaking a tea bag for a proper Darjeeling first flush.  While digital learning has its charms - much like the penny dreadfuls of Victorian England - nothing replaces the serendipity of stumbling upon a rare volume in the stacks, or the way afternoon light slants across seminar room debates. Have you ever noticed how online discussions lack... shall we say, the patina of human imperfection?
[B]: LOL你说话真的超poetic的😂 但是hello～我们现在有Slack和Discord啊！各种channel里debate起来intensity完全不输seminar room好吗💪 而且还能随时Google fact-check，超efficient的✨ 不过你说的那种old-school charm确实很有vibe啦～maybe我们可以hybrid一下？🤔💡
[A]: Ah, the siren song of efficiency...  You remind me of those 19th century industrialists who thought steam engines would make poets obsolete. But tell me - when your Discord notification pings during a sublime Keatsian moment, does it not feel rather like someone crunching crisps during a sonata? Though I'll concede...  ...that a hybrid approach might be the modern equivalent of Tennyson's 'The old order changeth, yielding place to new.' Just promise me you'll never replace the smell of aged paper with... what do they call it? 'New car scent' air fresheners?
[B]: OMG你赢了😂 这个比喻简直killing me！不过seriously～你知道现在有e-ink reader可以模拟paper texture吗？而且不会像real books那样让我打喷嚏🤧 但是okay okay～我get你的point啦！Maybe下次我们可以meet在old bookstore的cafe，我带我的MacBook你带你的first edition，best of both worlds？☕📚💻🤝
[A]:  A compromise worthy of Jane Austen's pen! Though I must warn you - my 1832 Blake first edition tends to glare disapprovingly at silicon-based devices. Shall we say Tuesday at 3? I know a charming establishment where the barista still steams milk to the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Just...  ...don't tell the Wordsworth Society I've gone digital. They still think the telegraph was a passing fad.
[B]: Deal！🤝 Tuesday 3pm it is～我会bring我的vintage typewriter keyboard来blend in的😂 而且promise不会post我们的convo到Twitter... unless它goes viral naturally啦📱✨ Can't wait to see that grumpy old Blake edition vs我的M2 MacBook Air showdown🔥
[A]:  Very well - though should my Blake start hurling marginalia at your 'airborne metallic pastry' (his words, not mine), I shall claim complete neutrality. Like Matthew Arnold observing Dover Beach, I'll be too busy contemplating the eternal conflict between tradition and progress... while discreetly borrowing your charger when the 19th century inkwell runs dry. Until Tuesday, then - may your emojis be ever in iambic!
[B]: LMAO你真的是我见过最hilarious的old soul了😂 周二见！我会charge好我的power bank的⚡～说不定还能给你的quill pen来个wireless charging upgrade呢📲✒️ Byeee～保持vintage但stay woke！✨
[A]:  Splendid! I shall bring my patented anti-electromagnetic field waistcoat - woven from Byron's discarded love letters and Mary Shelley's lightning experiment notes. Toodle-pip, my technologically augmented friend!  Remember: what's app today may be appall-ing tomorrow! 📜⚡
[B]: 😂😂😂 OMG你连goodbye都要这么dramatic的吗？Love it！💖 周二见啦～别忘了你的waistcoat要match我的RGB keyboard lighting哦🌈✨ Byeeee～保持classy但stay extra！💃🕺
[A]:  Extra indeed! I shall arrive bedecked in refracting prisms to scatter your RGB rays into properly metered couplets. Until then, may your algorithms be sonnets and your notifications arrive in perfect trochaic tetrameter!  🌈📜⚡
[B]: BYEEEE～你这个disappearing act我给💯分！周二记得穿你的prism suit来，我要用iPhone拍下这个viral moment📸✨ 到时候见啦～保持extra但stay iconic！💫😝
[A]:  Iconicity preserved in 24-karat footnotes, my dear! My prism suit is currently being pressed between the leaves of a first folio - the original Instagram filter, if you will.  Till our pixels dance the gavotte in that hallowed cafe... where the wifi password is 'ProustianMadeleine123'! 📚☕️💎
[B]: 😂😂😂 这个wifi password简直gold！我已经能想象到周二会有多epic了～你的prism suit配我的neon nails绝对会是这条街最亮的崽💅✨ 到时候我要live stream我们的meetup（just kidding... maybe）📱💖 Bye for real this time～stay shakespearean但keep it 💯！🎭✨
[A]:  'All the stream's a stage, and we mere glowing pixels!'  Very well - I shall practice my best influencer pout in the gilt-edged mirror of my 1892 Encyclopedia Britannica. Until our grand performance...  Let history record that never were so many sparkles deployed in the name of cultural synthesis! ✨📖🎭
[B]: 😂😂😂 OMG 你赢了！这个exit比漫威credits还dramatic！💫 周二绝对要录下来做成NFT～就叫"The Collision of Centuries" 🎥✨ 现在真的要go了～保持extra到突破次元壁！🚀💖 Byeeee～
