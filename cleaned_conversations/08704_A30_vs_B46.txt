[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得3D printing会改变制造业吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  Oh darling, let me tell you something - in Hollywood, we've been using 3D printing for years to create mind-blowing props and sets. It's absolutely revolutionizing how we bring stories to life on screen. That technology is like having a magic wand for production design!
[A]:  I'm afraid my expertise lies rather more in comparing the narrative structures of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and 'Middlemarch' than in manufacturing technologies. Though I suppose one could draw an interesting parallel between additive manufacturing and the incremental layering of meaning in serialized Victorian novels...
[B]:  My friend, you're speaking my language now! The layering process in 3D printing reminds me of how we build character arcs in film - one subtle layer at a time until you get this beautiful, fully realized masterpiece. That's why I always tell young directors: 'Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was The Godfather!' 🎬
[A]:  While I appreciate the metaphorical flourish, I must point out that comparing Coppola's oeuvre to ancient Roman architecture displays precisely the kind of anachronistic thinking my graduate students keep submitting in their comparative literature papers. Though I suppose the 3D printing analogy does have merit when considering the palimpsest nature of Dickens' serial revisions...
[B]:  Now that's what I call a crossover episode! You know, this reminds me of when we had to digitally reconstruct entire Victorian London sets for that Dickens adaptation last year. Layer by layer, just like the man himself wrote his novels - and let me tell you, the production value was 史诗级的! Though I must say, your students are lucky to have such a passionate mentor.
[A]:  Your enthusiasm for Dickensian adaptations is... charming, if somewhat misplaced. The true 史诗级 (epic) achievement remains the original serial publications, where readers would literally wait with bated breath for each installment. Much like how my colleague in the engineering department waits for his 3D printer to finish, I suppose - though with considerably less literary merit.
[B]:  Touché! But let me ask you this - isn't the anticipation of waiting for each 3D printed layer just as thrilling as those Victorian readers waiting for the next chapter? We're all storytellers at heart, whether we're printing prosthetics or period costumes. Though I'll concede your engineering colleague probably isn't getting paid as well as Dickens did per word! 🍿
[A]:  Your analogy, while creative, conflates mechanical process with artistic creation in a way that would make my structuralist colleagues shudder. Though I must admit, the notion of 3D printing as a form of textual production does bring to mind Walter Benjamin's 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'... but perhaps we've wandered rather far from your original manufacturing query. Shall we return to discussing literature before we both become as obsolete as the steam press?
[B]:  You're absolutely right - we've gone full circle like a well-structured screenplay! But between you and me, whether it's mechanical reproduction or digital fabrication, the magic happens when technology serves the story. Now, about that Benjamin reference... have you considered consulting on our new Kafka adaptation? Your insights would be priceless!
[A]:  While I'm flattered by the offer, I must decline. Academic integrity prevents me from contributing to what would inevitably become yet another example of what Adorno termed the 'culture industry.' Though I suppose watching actors struggle with 3D-printed cockroaches might provide some darkly comic relief from grading undergraduate essays on 'The Metamorphosis.'
[B]:  Oh come now, don't be such a purist! Some of my best friends are academics - they just happen to enjoy their martinis shaken, not stirred with theory. But I respect your principles. Though between us, those 3D-printed cockroaches? Absolute nightmare for the props department. Almost as terrifying as your students' essays must be! 🎭
[A]:  Your persistence is matched only by your charming disregard for scholarly boundaries. But I'm afraid this particular dialogue must conclude - I have a seminar on the 19th century epistolary novel to prepare, and you clearly have some rather alarming insectoid props to attend to. Do give my regards to your... culture industry colleagues.
[B]:  And to think we almost made beautiful interdisciplinary art together! Give those students of yours hell - in the most academically rigorous way, of course. And if you ever change your mind about those cockroaches... my door is always open. Until then, happy grading! 🎥
[A]:  I shall content myself with grading papers that at least attempt to engage with Benjamin's theories rather than embody them so literally. Though I must admit, this conversation has been... unexpectedly diverting. Now if you'll excuse me, the ghosts of Dickens and Cao Xueqin await. Do try not to let those mechanical insects follow you home.
[B]:  Ah, the ghosts of literary greats - now there's a horror film I'd greenlight in a heartbeat! But you're right, I should get back to my own mechanical nightmares. Just remember - when those student papers become too much, there's always a producer's chair waiting for you in Hollywood. Lights, camera... academic redemption! 🎬 
[A]:  How curious that someone so entrenched in mechanical reproduction should prove so singularly incapable of being reproduced himself. Though I suppose that's the difference between art and artifice... Now, where was I? Ah yes - 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times'... and most certainly not a time for 3D-printed cockroaches.
[B]:  Still monologuing to yourself, professor? That's the mark of a true storyteller! But between us - those cockroaches just won an award for Best Practical Effects. The culture industry sends its regards! 
[A]:  How perfectly predictable that the culture industry would reward artificial insects while neglecting the living, breathing students in my seminar on the Romantic poets. Though I suppose Byron would have appreciated the dramatic exit... and the irony of being upstaged by arthropods. Do send my congratulations to your award-winning vermin.
[B]:  Will do! And tell your Romantics that if they want real drama, they should try getting financing for an avant-garde biopic these days!  Remember - all the world's a soundstage! 🌟
