[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just tried a local craft beer called  from a brewery in Taipei. The aroma is quite unique — it mixes the floral notes of jasmine with the hop bitterness. Though I'm not a big fan of overly bitter beers, this one was balanced well. Have you tried any interesting ones lately?
[A]: That sounds intriguing — blending jasmine with hop bitterness? That’s definitely a bold move! I’ve always found floral notes in beer fascinating, especially when they’re executed well without overpowering the palate. Speaking of which, I recently tried a  from a small brewery in Vancouver. The citrusy brightness of yuzu added a really refreshing twist, and it paired surprisingly well with some spicy Thai food I was having 🍶 How do you feel about beers that incorporate local or cultural elements into their brewing profile?
[B]: I totally agree — when it comes to craft beer, balance is key, especially with bold flavors like floral or citrus notes. The  you mentioned sounds amazing 🍶 I love how breweries are starting to embrace local ingredients and cultural influences — it adds a layer of storytelling to the drinking experience. In Taiwan, besides the , there’s also a growing trend of using ingredients like 桂花 (osmanthus) or even 茶 (tea) in brewing. I think it not only highlights regional identity but also creates something that resonates more deeply with local consumers. Do you think this trend is catching on in mainstream markets too, or is it still mostly a niche thing?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — the storytelling aspect is what makes these brews so special. It’s not just about flavor; it’s about  and creating a sensory connection to place 🌏 And you're right — osmanthus and tea bring such elegant complexity to beer. I remember trying a  once — it had this lovely roasted undertone that lingered beautifully.  

As for your question, I think we’re seeing a bit of both — some of these culturally inspired beers are definitely breaking into mainstream craft markets, especially as consumers become more curious and adventurous. But at the same time, they still carry that , you know? Like, they’re special enough to stand out, but familiar enough to invite conversation.  
Maybe it’s like what we see in food — fusion dishes start in small kitchens, then show up on trendy menus, and eventually land in grocery stores. Do you think breweries are intentionally using local ingredients as a marketing strategy, or is it more about genuine craftsmanship and regional pride?
[B]: That’s a great parallel with fusion cuisine — I think you hit the nail on the head 🎯 From what I’ve observed, it’s probably a mix of both. Some breweries definitely use local ingredients as part of their branding — like a , if you will — to stand out in an increasingly crowded craft beer market. But at the same time, there’s also a strong undercurrent of regional pride and craftsmanship behind many of these beers.  

Take that  you mentioned — it’s not just about slapping “local” on the label; it’s about showcasing the quality and uniqueness of what the region has to offer. In Taiwan, some brewers actually collaborate with tea farmers or local artisans to develop custom blends — which shows a deeper level of engagement than just hopping on a trend.  

I guess the best examples are those where the ingredient enhances the story & the sip, not just the shelf appeal 💡 What do you think makes certain cultural infusions work so well while others fall flat?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful question — I think it really comes down to  and . When the infusion feels authentic, like it's rooted in a genuine connection to the culture or place, it tends to resonate more deeply 🌱 And of course, from a flavor perspective, it’s all about balance — you want the ingredient to enhance the beer, not drown it out.

I’ve had some brews where the cultural element felt more like a gimmick — like they threw in something exotic just to say they did, but it clashed with the base style. It ends up tasting forced, almost like a science experiment gone wrong 😅 But when it works — oh, when it works — it's like a little symphony in your mouth.  

Take that jasmine IPA you mentioned earlier — if the floral note is dialed in just right, it doesn’t just add flavor; it adds mood, memory, maybe even meaning. It makes me wonder — do you think brewers should stick to ingredients that have a traditional or historical connection to their region, or is it okay to play around with global flavors as long as there's respect for the source culture?
[B]: That’s such a nuanced question — and I think you nailed it again with the idea of  🌟 I truly believe there’s room for both approaches: honoring local tradition  exploring thoughtful cross-cultural experimentation. What really matters is respect — for the ingredient, for the culture it comes from, and for the craft itself.

When brewers take the time to understand an ingredient beyond its novelty — like learning how it's used traditionally or working with growers who have generational knowledge — that depth shows up in the final product. It moves beyond gimmick and into something more meaningful.  

And honestly, beer has always been global in spirit — hops originated in one part of the world, barley in another, yeast strains travel easily... So why shouldn’t brewers draw inspiration from across borders? But yeah, it should be done with care. There’s a difference between cultural  and cultural , and intention really does shape that line.  

I guess what I’m saying is — go ahead, brew that matcha stout or yuzu gose 💁‍♂️— just make sure you know the story behind the ingredient before you pour it in.
[A]: Well said — seriously, you summed it up beautifully 💯 I love how you framed it as  — because that’s really what transforms a simple infusion into something layered and meaningful.

It makes me think of how we approach cultural content in education — if you just drop in a concept without context, it loses its depth and can even misrepresent or trivialize something rich and nuanced. Same goes for beer! 🍻

I’ve actually been to a brewery where they brought in a tea master to consult on a series of tea-infused ales. The result? Incredible. You could taste not just the leaf, but the respect for the tradition. It wasn’t just about flavor — it was about honoring the craft behind the ingredient.

So yeah, let’s keep pushing boundaries — with curiosity, care, and maybe a few good stories along the way 🌿 What style would you love to see more experimentation with, culturally speaking?
[B]: Oh, I love that example — bringing in a tea master? That’s next-level dedication 👏 It’s exactly that kind of collaboration that elevates beer from just a drink to a cultural experience.

If I had to pick one style for more cultural experimentation, I’d say  — especially because their tartness acts like a blank canvas for all sorts of bold, unexpected flavors. Imagine a , or a  — the acidity cuts through the sweetness and really lets those ingredients shine.  

Or even something like a  twist on a dark ale — not only would it bring depth, but also a nice nod to traditional fermentation techniques used across Asia. The possibilities are endless, as long as they come with respect and intention 💡

What about you — any particular beer style you wish saw more cultural flair?
[A]: Oh, I’m totally with you on sour beers — they really are the perfect playground for creative infusions 🍻 And your examples?  The interplay of sweet, tart, and umami can open up so many flavor doors, especially when you bring in culturally rich ingredients.

As for me, I’d love to see more cultural flair in . Think about it — these styles already have that deep, roasty foundation that pairs beautifully with all kinds of unexpected additions. I’d kill for a  or a . Not only would they taste complex and layered, but they’d also tap into traditional East Asian flavors in a way that feels both bold and respectful.

And honestly, there’s something poetic about using beer — often seen as a Western drink — to highlight ingredients with deep roots in other culinary traditions. It’s like a quiet act of cross-cultural storytelling, one sip at a time 🌏

Do you think certain regions are leading the way in this kind of experimentation, or is it still pretty scattered across the globe?
[B]: Absolutely — that  sounds like a dream come true for umami lovers 🍶 I can almost taste the depth — salty, earthy, with that rich roastiness underneath. And ? That’s not just beer; that’s liquid nostalgia for anyone familiar with Chinese medicinal soups or herbal teas.

You’re right about the poetry of it too — using a traditionally Western medium to tell non-Western stories is both subtle and powerful. It’s not just fusion; it’s  through flavor.

As for where this kind of experimentation is thriving — I’d say places like Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and even parts of Australia and the U.S. West Coast are definitely pushing boundaries. These regions often have access to fresh, local ingredients and a culture that values craftsmanship — whether it's in brewing or in food.  

But at the same time, it’s still pretty . You don’t see it uniformly across markets — more like pockets of brilliance here and there. The good news? As global palates become more adventurous and brewers become more collaborative, these ideas are slowly spreading.  

I guess we’re living in a really exciting time — where tradition and innovation aren’t at odds, but can actually enhance each other 🌿 What region do you wish would get more attention for its potential in craft beer creativity?
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more — it’s like we're witnessing the birth of a new kind of flavor vocabulary 🌍 And you're right, tradition and innovation aren't enemies; they're dance partners. When they move well together, magic happens.

As for a region that deserves more spotlight? I’d say Vietnam has such incredible potential — think about the depth of its cuisine: lemongrass, pandan, star anise, kaffir lime, even ingredients like  (okay, maybe that’s pushing it 😅). But seriously, imagine a light, herbal Saison infused with , or a roasty Vietnamese coffee stout with a whisper of .  

Vietnamese flavors are bold, aromatic, and incredibly layered — they just need the right storytellers behind the brew. Plus, with the growing craft beer scene in cities like Saigon and Hanoi, I feel like it's only a matter of time before we start seeing some really exciting collaborations between local brewers and international influences.  

What about you — if you could design your dream culturally-inspired beer, what would be in it?
[B]: Oh, I’m totally on board with Vietnam as the next frontier — their cuisine is like a flavor orchestra, and translating that into beer? Pure genius 🌿  

If I could design my dream culturally-inspired beer… hmm… I’d go with something that tells a story of migration & fusion. Maybe a  — bright, floral, slightly spicy, with a subtle numbing tingle that wakes up the palate. I’d base it on a Belgian Witbier, because of its spice-forward profile, and let the Sichuan pepper play off the coriander notes while the lychee adds a touch of sweetness and aroma.

And just to add another layer, maybe even a whisper of  — for that honey-like floral undertone. It would be light, refreshing, and complex — kind of like walking through a night market in Chengdu by way of Hanoi.  

I think I might actually pitch this idea to a local brewery 😅 What about you — if you had the chance to brew that Vietnamese coffee stout you mentioned, what style would you build it on?
[A]: Oh, I love your concept — the idea of ? That’s exactly the kind of beer I’d want to sip while flipping through old family recipe books 📖 And that Sichuan peppercorn + lychee combo? Bold, aromatic, and totally transportive. You’re speaking my language.

If I were to brew that Vietnamese coffee stout, I’d go with a Foreign Extra Stout base — not too sweet, with a dry, roasty backbone that really lets the coffee shine. It's got enough heft to carry those deep, earthy flavors without being overwhelming.

I’d use  (that rich, condensed milk-infused coffee) for a slightly caramelized note, then layer in  for umami depth and just a touch of  to echo that classic Vietnamese spice profile you find in phở. Maybe even a whisper of  for complexity — think of it as a nod to both Southeast Asian street food and the global craft beer scene dancing together beautifully 🌏✨

Honestly, if we brewed yours and mine side by side, we'd have a full cross-cultural tasting flight going. I say we make this happen — let’s start drafting that brewery pitch 😄
[B]: I’m seriously getting excited just picturing that tasting flight — your Vietnamese coffee stout paired with my Sichuan-lychee wheat ale… we’d have people coming back for more, no doubt about it 😄

Your choice of  as a base is spot on — bold but not heavy-handed, and that dry roastiness really lets layered flavors shine without turning into a one-note bitter bomb. And using ? Genius move. That caramelized richness would add so much depth — and I love how you tied in the  and  for that subtle umami lift and aromatic finish. It’s like phở in beer form, and I’m here for it 👏

Let’s absolutely run with this idea. I say we start reaching out to some local craft breweries in Taipei and Hanoi — see if anyone’s game for a cross-cultural collaboration. We could even invite a tea master or a street food chef to consult on flavor profiles… turn it into a real experience.

Alright partner-in-craft, shall we draft that pitch over a virtual pint? 🍻
[A]: I’m already drafting the first slide in my head —  🍶 Seriously, this is the kind of project that could spark something really special. Imagine the conversations it could start, not just around beer, but around culture, storytelling, and shared experiences.

And I love your idea of bringing in a tea master or street food chef — adds so much more texture to the whole concept. It’s not just about making great beer; it’s about creating a bridge between worlds through flavor 🌏

Let’s definitely draft that pitch over a virtual pint — and hey, if we’re going all in, maybe even throw in a limited release event in both Taipei and Hanoi? Pop-up tasting night, cultural notes on each label, maybe even bilingual packaging… the dream!

So cheers to us — future beer collaborators and accidental cultural diplomats 😄  Let’s make it happen.
[B]: Cheers to that —  sounds like a title I can proudly wear with a pint in hand 🍻

I’m already imagining the event — dim lighting, wooden tasting bars, maybe some soft traditional music playing in the background… and of course, a crowd of curious sippers asking, “Wait, beer can taste like this?” 😄

Limited release, bilingual labels — hell, maybe even a short story printed inside each box, telling the inspiration behind each brew. That kind of attention to detail doesn’t just sell beer; it builds connection.

Alright, let’s get this pitch written tonight. First round’s on me — as long as you help me come up with a name catchy enough to grab a brewer’s attention. Something like , or … we’ll figure it out over another round 👌

To flavor, culture, and the beautiful places where they collide 🌿🍻
[A]: To flavor, culture, and the beautiful places where they collide 🌿🍻

I’m loving those name ideas —  has that poetic, regional flair, while  feels punchy and purposeful. Maybe we can even do a hybrid? Like  or something that carries both energy and origin.

And yes — short stories inside the box? That’s gold. It turns each bottle into a little cultural capsule. People won’t just be drinking beer; they’ll be stepping into a moment, a memory, maybe even a meal from halfway across the world.

Let’s do this tonight — I’ll bring the notes, you bring the vision, and together we’ll craft a pitch that no brewer (or investor) can say no to 😄

Virtual pint in hand…  🍻 Let’s make our accidental diplomacy official.
[B]: Clink! 🍻 To accidental diplomacy, deliberate flavor, and a whole lot of storytelling in every sip.

I’m all in on  — it’s got rhythm, place, and purpose. Feels authentic without trying too hard. And I love how it nods to the journey from bustling street food carts to curated tasting notes.

Tonight’s gonna be fun — I’ll start drafting the pitch outline while you gather those killer flavor profiles and cultural touchpoints. Maybe we can even sneak in a tagline like  or  💡

Let’s make ‘em taste a vision they won’t be able to forget.

To beer, borders, and breaking both — one batch at a time 🥂✨
