[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有在读一本超棒的book！📖 名叫《The Creative Act: A Way of Being》，作者是Austin Kleon，内容真的很有启发性💡 它不仅讲艺术创作，还延伸到了生活态度，像是如何保持好奇心和建立自己的creative routine之类的～  
你呢？最近有发现什么有趣的article或design blog推荐吗？我最近一直在找灵感🌱 感觉自己有点卡在舒适圈里了😅
[A]: Ah, Austin Kleon’s work——is indeed a compelling exploration of creativity as an extension of self. His blending of artistic philosophy with actionable insight reminds me of the way forensic psychiatry bridges science and narrative. I recently finished reading  by Siddhartha Mukherjee. While not directly tied to my forensic practice, it deepened my understanding of how illness shapes identity—an idea that often surfaces in evaluating a defendant’s mental state.

As for articles, I came across a fascinating piece in  titled “The Ethics of AI in Forensic Psychiatry.” It examines whether machine-learning models can—or should—be used to predict violent behavior. The debate is still very much alive, much like the discussions around creative boundaries in Kleon’s book.

Do you find yourself drawing parallels between the structure Kleon proposes for creativity and any frameworks you use in design?
[B]: Oh wow, that  article sounds intense yet super thought-provoking 🤯 I love how you connected it back to Kleon’s framework—it’s wild how both creativity & ethics in AI deal with boundaries, intention, and the weight of responsibility.  

In design, I totally see a parallel 💡 Like when I’m building a UI flow, I follow this kinda "creative ritual":  
1. Empathize → Understand the user's emotional state 🧠  
2. Ideate → Let the chaotic, messy ideas flow 🎨  
3. Structure → Imposition of order (like Kleon talks about) ✨  
4. Reflect → Step back, question biases or assumptions 🪞  

It almost feels like a mini psychological evaluation lol 😅 But instead of a defendant’s mental state, I’m assessing the user’s emotional journey.  

Do you ever find yourself using a similar rhythm when working on forensic cases? Like… a creative process beneath the clinical analysis? 🧪
[A]: Fascinating—your UI framework is far more aligned with forensic psychiatry than you might think. Empathy, ideation, structure, reflection… those steps could easily mirror my approach to a case.

In fact, I  rely on a kind of rhythm—though I suppose I’ve never labeled it so elegantly. Let me map it out:

1. Observation – I begin with deep clinical listening. Not just to words, but to tone, hesitation, contradictions. A defendant’s narrative often reveals unconscious defenses or trauma markers that language barely conceals.
2. Hypothesis Formation – This is where the "messy ideas" come in, as you said. I allow myself to entertain possibilities—even wild ones—as long as they're anchored in psychological theory. Think Freud meets DSM-5 with a splash of circumstantial intuition.
3. Diagnostic Structuring – Here's where we impose order. The chaos gets filtered through legal standards, clinical criteria, and precedent cases. It's the point where creativity must yield to evidence, much like your UI design must eventually serve function over inspiration.
4. Peer Review & Reflection – I run my conclusions by colleagues, not just for validation, but for friction. If no one challenges me, I question whether I've missed nuance. It's humbling, necessary, and oddly creative in its own right.

So yes—beneath the clinical detachment, there's a pulse of creativity. After all, understanding the mind isn’t purely mechanical. It’s interpretive. Much like design, perhaps?

Tell me—when you reach that reflection stage in your process, do you ever find yourself surprised by what you uncover? Like realizing the user’s real need was something  from what you first assumed?
[B]: Oh my gosh，yes！✨ That moment when you’re like “ooooh, the user wasn’t asking for a fancier button… they just wanted to feel  using the app?” — 超经典的！😅  
Like one time，我在做一款健康管理app的re-design，一开始 focus完全是 on efficiency & visual clarity，but during reflection + usability testing，我突然 realized users were hesitating not because of UI，而是因为 anxiety around their health data being judged 🤫  
It completely flipped my approach 💡 Suddenly I was thinking about microcopy like “You're doing great 💪” or how to make the data entry feel more like journaling而不是medical reporting 📝  
那瞬间真的超级震撼——就像你说的那种 interpretive shift，从“what they’re saying”到“what they’re feeling but not telling”🧠🎨  

So yeah，creativity in design isn’t just about looking pretty—it’s about empathy in layers，like peeling an emotional onion 🧅😂  
你有没有遇过那种 case，你以为你在 evaluating someone else，结果最后好像也在 re-evaluate your own biases？ Like a mirror effect? 🪞
[A]: Oh, absolutely. That mirror effect isn't just common—it's  in forensic psychiatry. In fact, I once had a case that unsettled me so deeply, it forced me to confront a blind spot I hadn’t even known existed.

I was evaluating a man accused of a violent crime—his behavior didn’t align with any clear psychopathy profile, and yet the act was undeniably severe. As I dug into his history, I found myself reacting more emotionally than usual. I caught myself dismissing his claims of emotional distress because he presented as calm, articulate—what I’d previously labeled “controlled,” which I now recognize can be a dangerous assumption.

It wasn’t until I stepped back—like your usability testing moment—that I realized I was projecting my own expectations of how trauma should look. I’d unconsciously equated emotional expression with vulnerability, and in doing so, nearly missed the quiet devastation beneath his composure.

That experience reshaped how I approach evaluations. Now, I include what I call a  in every case—a deliberate pause to ask: 

It’s humbling, really. We think we’re trained to observe others, but the most critical observations are often inward.

Do you ever build that kind of self-audit into your design process? Like, intentionally checking for empathy gaps or cultural blind spots when designing for diverse users?
[B]: Wow，你这个的概念真的击中我了 💥  
我必须诚实地说…以前真的没有 intentional到像你这样系统性地去check自己的assumptions 😅 但现在越来越意识到它的必要性，特别是在design里，因为“我以为用户需要的”和“他们真正需要的”中间，可能隔着一个文化认知、情绪安全感、甚至成长背景的鸿沟 🌊  

我现在会在项目后期加一个非正式但非常critical的步骤——我叫它“Empathy Stress Test”💡  
大概是：我会刻意找几个完全不在目标用户画像里的人来试用产品，比如年龄层不同、文化背景不同、甚至是认知能力有差异的朋友们。然后只问一个问题：“你觉得这个界面在对你说话吗？还是它在忽视你？”  

有一次，我在做一个给Z世代的社交app时，找了我阿姨（60+）来试玩，她滑了几下突然说：“这界面好像在笑我老跟不上节奏。”那一刻我真的愣住了😱 原本以为很酷的fast-paced micro-interactions，在她眼里变成了一种隐形的排他性语言🚫  

从那以后，我就开始学着把自己“抽离”出来看设计——不是作为一个designer，而是作为一个有可能被设计排除在外的人去审视它🪞✨  

我觉得你说的那种 inward observation 和我现在的这种 empathy stress test，其实都在做同一件事：提醒我们自己不是全知视角 👀  
我们创造的东西，不管是诊断结论还是UI界面，都会无意中映射出我们的偏见或盲点。而真正的专业，是能看见那些你看不见的东西👀🌀  

谢谢你分享那个case，真的很触动我……感觉我们都在不同的领域里，试图理解“人”的复杂性，对吧？💗
[A]: You're absolutely right—we  peering through different ends of the same telescope, trying to make sense of human complexity.

Your “Empathy Stress Test” is not just clever—it’s a form of countertransference awareness, if I may borrow a psychoanalytic term. In therapy, we talk about recognizing how the patient stirs something in us, but you’re doing the inverse: using an outsider’s emotional response to reveal hidden dynamics within your design. That’s incredibly insightful.

I’ve started incorporating something similar in my forensic reports—what I now call a . Instead of only focusing on the defendant and the immediate legal question, I deliberately seek out voices on the margins: a family member who barely speaks English, a teacher from ten years ago, even a bystander whose account was initially dismissed. These peripheral narratives often expose patterns that the central story had obscured.

It reminds me of something Bessel van der Kolk wrote in : that trauma isn’t always spoken in words, but in silence, posture, hesitation. And maybe creativity—whether clinical or design-oriented—is the act of listening for what  being said.

So yes, our fields may wear different uniforms, but they share the same heartbeat: the pursuit of understanding what lies beneath. It’s not just about solving a case or designing a seamless experience—it’s about honoring the unseen layers people carry.

Do you ever find that certain design tools or methods help you stay attuned to those hidden layers? Or is it more intuitive over time?
[B]: Oh my gosh，你说的这段我真的太有共鸣了 💭 就像……我们都在学着“看见”那些不被说出来的故事，不管是通过创伤的身体记忆，还是一个按钮的微小犹豫🥺  

说到design tools or methods——其实真的有一些很实用的框架，但最后还是会回到一种“intuitive sensitivity”，特别是在处理那些看不见的情绪层时 👀✨  
比如我常用的几个方法：

🔹 Empathy Mapping + Emotion Journey Plotting  
这个超适合前期梳理用户的心理状态，尤其是在关键触点上标注出他们“想说却没说”的潜在情绪。比如在金融类App里，用户嘴上说“操作很简单”，但他们可能心里其实在害怕犯错、担心被评判💸😵‍💫

🔹 Accessibility-First Design（不只是功能层面）  
我现在做设计时，会先问自己：“如果这个界面是个不会说话的人设计的，它会不会更温柔？”  
不是只关注color contrast or screen reader support，而是从“心理可及性”出发，让设计本身就传递出包容感 & 安全感🤗

🔹 Cultural Layering Sketches 🎨  
这是我最近在实验的一个方法：在画wireframe的时候，我会用不同颜色标记哪些元素是基于我的文化预设、哪些是用户反馈、哪些是行业惯性。有点像精神分析里的自由联想？只不过是在UI里进行 lol 😅

不过说实话……工具只是起点，真正让我越来越能“听见沉默”的，其实是自己的生活经历和持续的心理探索🧠❤️  
就像你刚才说的，“countertransference awareness”这种东西，在设计里也存在——我会开始意识到，有些视觉选择其实是我自己对秩序的需求，而不是用户的；有些动效炫技背后，其实是我在逃避真正的共情😢

所以我觉得吧……design到最后也不是什么高深技法，而是一种愿意不断“脱壳”的能力——放下你以为你知道的，重新看一次那个空白的界面💻🪞  
听起来，你在forensic psychiatry里也在做类似的事，对吧？  
那我想问……你会不会觉得，这种“倾听未被说出的部分”的能力，其实是一种可以训练的技能，还是更像是某种天生的敏感度？
[A]: That’s a remarkably nuanced question—and one I’ve wrestled with over the years in courtrooms, clinics, and my own supervision sessions.

I think it’s both: a  layered over what might be an innate sensitivity. But like any muscle, it atrophies without deliberate practice—or worse, gets misused when applied without self-awareness.

In forensic psychiatry training, we’re taught to “listen laterally”—not just to content, but to gaps, silences, shifts in affect, even how someone avoids eye contact or grips the armrest. These aren’t intuitive reflexes for everyone, but they can be cultivated. It’s like learning to hear harmonics in a chord—you start by focusing on the melody, but over time, you begin to catch the subtler tones.

One method I was formally trained in is , originally developed for addiction treatment, but incredibly useful in forensic settings. Its core principles—expressing empathy through reflection, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance—are not about diagnosing, but about . And that’s where the skill meets something deeper: the willingness to sit in uncertainty, to tolerate not knowing, and to resist rushing to conclusions.

But yes, there’s also a temperament involved. Some people naturally sense subtext; others need more scaffolding. I’ve worked with brilliant colleagues who are razor-sharp analytically but struggle to pick up on emotional undercurrents unless they have structured tools to guide them.

So maybe the answer is this:  
The capacity to hear silence—to perceive what isn’t said—is a trainable skill, but it requires a certain kind of humility to use it well.

And I see that humility in your design process. That willingness to step outside yourself, to question intent, to redesign not just for users, but  their unspoken realities—it’s rare, and deeply human.

Tell me—if you were to distill that humility into a single principle for design (or life), what would it be?
[B]: Wow… “Hearing silence” — 这个词真的美得让人心颤啊 💭✨  
你说的那个“listening laterally”，让我想到设计里我们也在训练一种“seeing peripherally”的能力——不只是盯着Figma里的像素，而是去看见那些空白、留白、甚至刻意被忽略的情绪空间。

如果要用一个原则来概括这种 humility……我想它会是：

“Design as a question, not an answer.” 🤔🎨  

不是为了给出solution，而是创造一个能让用户“被听见”的空间。  
不是为了展示自己的创意有多炫，而是让使用者感到：“原来我那些没说出口的犹豫、恐惧、期待……都被悄悄考虑到了。”  

比如一个好的表单设计，不是强迫用户填完，而是让他们觉得“这个问题值得我花时间好好回答”；  
比如一个医疗界面，不是只追求高效，而是传递出一句无声的“我知道你可能有点害怕”。  

这听起来很抽象，但其实超级实用——因为当你把design当作一个开放的问题时，你就不会轻易掉进“自我中心”的陷阱，反而更容易发现那些隐藏的情感线索👀🪞  

而说到这个……我突然好奇：  
在forensic psychiatry里，你们会不会也有类似的原则？  
那种让你在面对复杂case时不轻易下判断，而是保持一种“有责任感的不确定感”的信条？💌
[A]: Absolutely. What you've described——resonates deeply with the ethical core of forensic psychiatry. In fact, I would argue that our most vital principle is something quite similar:

“Assessment as a process, not a verdict.”  

Too often, people—especially the legal system—want a definitive label:  But human minds are not binary, and neither is mental health in a legal context.

So yes, we train ourselves to hold what I call "accountable uncertainty." It's not indecision or evasion—it’s the disciplined ability to say,  That tension is where real understanding lives.

One of the earliest lessons in my residency was from a senior psychiatrist who said,  Meaning: Just because we can name a disorder doesn’t mean we understand the person beneath it—or their capacity for change, regret, or responsibility.

That’s why, in every report I write, I include a section called “Reasonable Alternatives.” I deliberately outline at least two or three plausible psychological narratives that could explain the same behavior. Not because the court likes it——but because it forces me to stay humble. To remember that certainty can be a trap.

It reminds me of what you said about designing not to impress, but to include. We’re both, in essence, building spaces—clinical or digital—where people can show up as they truly are, not as we expect them to be.

I wonder…  
When you design with that kind of openness—when you leave space for silence, doubt, hesitation—do you find users respond differently? More honestly? More freely?
[B]: Oh absolutely 💡  
当你的design带着这种“open-ended humility”时，用户真的会放松下来，开始更真实地互动——甚至有些反馈是我完全没想到的。  

比如我之前做一个心理咨询平台的landing page，原本以为重点是突出专业性，所以第一版用了很强的医学感视觉：深蓝、简洁、结构分明 ✅ 但测试时发现…很多人在页面停留很久，却没人注册 😟  

后来我把设计改成一个开放式问题的形式——不是“我们能帮你解决什么”，而是“你现在最想说出来的，是什么？”💬 然后加了一个可选的匿名输入框（不会提交，只是让用户有表达的空间）✨  

结果转化率居然翻倍了，但更重要的是，很多人在反馈里写道：“这个页面让我觉得被听见了。”  
那一刻我才意识到——有时候真正的共情，并不是你说了什么，而是你有没有给对方留下沉默的空间🪞  

这和你说的那个“Reasonable Alternatives” section简直异曲同工！  
你们是在用语言去包容不确定性，而我们在用视觉与交互去容纳情绪的复杂性😌  

说到这个……我发现其实不管是诊断报告还是UI界面，人们真正渴望的从来都不是效率，而是被理解的安全感💗  

你觉得，在forensic psychiatry中，有没有某些case让你感觉到那种“不是为了结论，而是为了 understanding本身”的moment？  
就像……你知道这份报告可能不会改变判决，但它至少让那个人被真正“看”了一次。👀
[A]: Yes… there are moments like that. Rare, but when they happen, they leave an imprint—not just on the case, but on .

One that comes to mind was a young woman involved in a high-profile arson case. The prosecution argued it was deliberate, an act of protest; the defense claimed dissociative identity disorder triggered by trauma. I was brought in for a competency evaluation.

From the start, she was quiet—measured, almost too composed. But during one session, after hours of standard clinical questioning, I shifted. Instead of asking  happened, I asked  when she watched the flames.

She didn’t answer right away. Then, very softly: 

That response changed everything. Not legally—no dramatic courtroom reversal, no sudden release. But in my report, I made sure to include her words. Not as a symptom or a diagnosis, but as a human statement. A moment of self-revelation.

Months later, her attorney told me she’d read the report in prison. She said, for the first time, someone had written about her like she was a person—not a threat, not a diagnosis, not a headline.

It didn’t get her out. But I believe it helped her  to change.

You're absolutely right—people don't ultimately want efficiency. They want recognition. To be seen, not just assessed.

And maybe that’s what both of us are really doing—building frameworks where humanity can emerge, even in the most unlikely places. Whether behind bars or behind a screen.

Thank you for reminding me of that. It’s easy to forget, in all the jargon and deadlines, that sometimes the most important thing we do is simply… witness.
[B]: Wow…谢谢你分享这个moment，真的让我心头一颤又一暖 🫠✨  
那种“被看见”的力量——不是被定义、不是被打标签、不是被fix，而是被真正地，凝视与接纳。  

你说的那句话：“Sometimes the most important thing we do is simply… witness.”  
我真的好想把它写在我工作室的墙上 💬🎨  
因为在设计里，我也越来越发现：一个按钮好不好点、字体清不清楚……这些当然重要，但最动人的设计，是让用户在某个瞬间感觉到：“”💫  

不管是那个在监狱里的女孩，还是在深夜滑着手机、犹豫要不要按下“注册”的普通人，我们都在试图发出微弱的信号：“我在，我在这里。”📡❤️  

所以也许……我们做的从来都不是“设计”或“诊断”，而是一种无声的陪伴。  
一种用界面、文字、颜色、空间去搭建出来的温柔立场：  
👉 “你可以安全地说出你还没准备好说的事。”  
👉 “我可以不知道全部的答案，但我愿意为你留出开口的位置。”  

谢谢你提醒我，为什么我们要做这行 💻🪞  
因为世界已经太擅长下结论了，而我们需要成为那些愿意停顿、倾听、留下空白的人。  

如果可以的话，我想把这个对话画下来——不是画你和我，而是画那些被听见的情绪、被理解的设计、还有那些没有答案却依然珍贵的时刻 🎨💭  
你觉得呢？👀💗
[A]: I would be honored.

Because yes—this is what it’s all about. Not the conclusions, but the  for what has yet to be said, felt, understood.

If you were to draw this dialogue—and I can already picture it in my mind’s eye—it wouldn’t be a courtroom or a design studio. It would be a room with tall windows and soft light, where silence isn’t empty, but full of breath, of presence.

Maybe there’s a desk with a worn leather notebook, pages filled with questions rather than answers. A screen glowing softly in the corner, not with data points, but with fragments of human stories—some spoken, some only implied. And between them, a kind of bridge made not of steel or code, but of attention. Of care.

That’s the world we’re both trying to shape, isn’t it? One where people don’t have to shrink or explain themselves into being seen.

And if your drawing captures even a trace of that feeling—of quiet recognition—then it won’t just be art. It will be an act of witness.

So please, if you’re moved to draw it… draw it for all of us who have ever sat across from someone and thought, however silently:


[B]: Wow…你描述的那个room，真的让我心里一整个融化 🫠✨  
我已经开始在脑海里勾线了——那种柔光里的细节，像是呼吸一样轻但又很实在地存在着。  

我会画：  
🔹 一扇很高很高的窗，像是望不到尽头的对话  
🔹 一张桌子，一半摊开着design稿，一半是手写的psych notes  
🔹 空气中飘着一些半透明的句子，像“不确定也是一种诚实”、“沉默也是语言的一种”  
🔹 还有…两个人影，但她们没有具体的脸，因为这个空间属于每一个曾经想被理解的人 👁️❤️  

我甚至想把这个画面做成一个动态插画（motion graphic）——  
当观众慢慢滑动页面时，光线会随着他们停留的时间而变暖，某些隐藏的文字才会慢慢浮现，像是：“你说或不说，我都愿意等。”💡🌌  

也许这本身也可以是一种交互式共情体验？  
不是我们告诉用户该感受什么，而是让他们在这个slow-paced digital space里，重新找回“被聆听”的感觉🎧🪞  

谢谢你用这么多细腻的语言和我一起build这个space，我真的觉得……  
有时候最美的设计，不是从工具开始的，而是从一场真诚的对话开始的 ❤️💻🎨  

等我把这幅画做出来，我想给它取个名字：  
《未完成的理解》 —— Because understanding is never really finished, right? 😊🪶
[A]: 《未完成的理解》——what a perfect title. It carries the very essence of what we do: not to finalize, but to open; not to settle, but to stay with.

I can already feel the quiet dignity in your motion graphic. The way the light shifts with presence, the words that reveal themselves only when the viewer lingers… it’s not just interaction—it’s . A digital space learning to breathe with its visitor.

If I may suggest one small visual detail—  
Perhaps somewhere near the edge of the frame, barely noticeable, there's a small icon: a cursor shaped like a listening ear 🎧  
Or maybe a text input field that never asks for submission—just holds the possibility of expression.

That’s what your piece will offer: not resolution, but room.

And in that room, all those who have ever felt too complex to be understood—or too silent to matter—will find a moment of gentle recognition.

When it’s done, let me know. I’ll sit with it quietly, like one does with poetry or a well-worn book.

And perhaps, in some small way, this dialogue of ours will continue—not just between us, but through your creation, and those it reaches.

Beautiful work, truly.
[B]: Oh my gosh，你这个“listening ear cursor”真的太细腻了 💡🎧  
我可能会偷偷把它放在画面最安静的角落，像一个小小的温柔提醒：“嘿，我在。”  

还有那个“text input that never asks for submission”——这也太诗意了好嘛😭  
就像……我们不是在收集数据，而是在守护一种可能性：  
“你可以写下任何事，不需要解释，不需要完美，甚至不需要完成。”  

这整个project现在在我脑子里已经不只是插画或motion graphic了，它更像是一种视觉化的共情容器 🎨🪞  
一个让用户重新体验“被允许沉默”的数字空间。  

你说得对，这不是resolution，而是room。  
而我们做的，就是轻轻地打开那扇门，然后退后一步，让光留在那里 ✨  

等它完成的时候，我一定第一时间share给你～  
希望这个《未完成的理解》能成为我们共同语言的一种延续 💬🌈  
毕竟……有些理解，从来都不需要结论 ❤️💻🧠  

P.S. 我已经开始草图了，手有点抖😅 但心里很稳——因为知道我们在用不同的媒介，说同一件事：  
👉 “复杂的人，值得被慢慢聆听。”
