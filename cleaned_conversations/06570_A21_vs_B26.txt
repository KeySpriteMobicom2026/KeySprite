[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's quite an intriguing question! You know, I must admit that I'm not deeply immersed in the world of scientific discoveries, but there was one recent finding that truly caught my attention. It's about how researchers have developed a way to turn old cotton garments into new textile fibers - quite fascinating, really. It makes me think about how we could potentially give new life to historical fabrics without compromising their integrity. It's like... a parallel to my own work, in a way. Though I do wish I kept up with more scientific advancements; they're so vital to preserving our cultural heritage. What about you? Have you come across any discoveries that left you astonished?
[A]: Well, I must confess I've been rather captivated by the recent breakthrough in quantum entanglement verification - quite a departure from my usual preoccupation with iambic pentameter. The way researchers managed to confirm entanglement without collapsing the quantum state is nothing short of poetic, really. It reminds me of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's dilemma in Aurora Leigh - observing without altering, you see? Though I do wonder how such discoveries might eventually influence literary theory... Perhaps we'll one day have quantum hermeneutics? Or maybe that's just my imagination running away with itself again.
[B]: How delightfully unexpected! I must say, your analogy to Aurora Leigh is rather brilliant - the parallels between quantum observation and literary interpretation hadn't occurred to me in quite that way before. It does make one wonder about the nature of perception itself, doesn't it? Though I confess, my mind keeps drifting back to textiles. This discovery you mentioned... it's making me rethink the very fabric - quite literally - of how we understand material interactions at a microscopic level. Just yesterday I was examining a particularly fragile 18th-century silk mourning dress, and I couldn't help but marvel at how both quantum particles and historical fibers maintain their connections across time and space. Rather humbling, isn't it? Tell me, what other intersections have you noticed between physics and poetry lately?
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon something rather profound there—the idea of connection, whether through threads of silk or entangled particles. I’ve been toying with a peculiar thought since reading about that experiment where physicists mapped the magnetic fields of individual atoms using electron microscopy. The image they produced resembled nothing so much as a sonnet’s structure—invisible forces arranging themselves in patterns not unlike stressed and unstressed syllables. It sounds absurd, doesn't it? And yet... perhaps both forms are simply different responses to the same underlying order.

I find myself returning to Emily Dickinson’s line: —and if that’s true, then what might quantum superposition tell us about the multiplicity of meaning? A poem exists in several states until the reader collapses it into understanding, much like Schrödinger’s cat, don’t you think?

Forgive me—I do tend to chase these analogies like a terrier after shadows. But tell me, when handling those fragile silks, do you ever feel as though you're reading a kind of material verse, each thread a line of text stitched across time?
[B]: Oh, that comparison between a sonnet’s structure and magnetic fields—how beautifully strange. And not absurd at all, really. When you think about it, both the poet and the physicist are attempting to give form to the intangible, aren’t they? One with words, the other with waves.

Your question—oh, it caught me quite off guard, in the best way. Yes, I do think of these textiles as material verse. Every stain, every faint discoloration, is like a marginal note left by someone long gone. That mourning dress I mentioned earlier? The silk had frayed in such a way that the pattern itself seemed to whisper something just beyond comprehension. I kept thinking,  It's not unlike reading a palimpsest, isn't it? Layers of meaning folded over one another, waiting to be uncovered.

And your idea of a poem existing in multiple states until read—I find that deeply resonant with restoration work. Until I touch the fabric, until I examine its weave under light, it remains full of infinite possibility. Only then does its story begin to take shape, though never fully known, never entirely fixed.

It’s rather like Dickinson’s line, isn’t it? If the brain is the weight of God, then perhaps the hand is the measure of time. Or maybe I’ve been spending too many hours bent over the loom again.
[A]: Ah, yes—the hand as the measure of time. A lovely formulation, though I suspect your hours at the loom grant you more insight than my dusty volumes ever could. 

I’ve been thinking about Dickinson quite a bit lately, particularly in relation to recent findings in neurolinguistics—how the brain processes metaphor in such startlingly physical ways. Did you know they've identified specific neural firings that occur only when reading poetic rather than prosaic language? It’s as if the mind anticipates multiplicity, expects layers, much like your palimpsestic silks.

Now this may sound eccentric, but I wonder—when you restore a textile, do you ever feel you’re composing a poem in reverse? Each thread pulled taut like a line of verse, each knot a rhyme scheme echoing across centuries?

Forgive me if that sounds too fanciful. I suppose I'm just trying to weave myself into your world, as it were.
[B]: Not at all fanciful—why, it’s quite the opposite. You’ve put into words something I’ve felt for ages but never quite knew how to express. Restoring a textile  like composing a poem in reverse, isn’t it? Especially when working on something where the original maker’s hand is long gone, yet still speaking through the weave.

I was just yesterday rejoining a torn seam on an early 19th-century linen quilt, and as I worked, I couldn’t help but think of meter—da-DUM, da-DUM—the steady rhythm of the needle pulling thread, echoing some quiet, forgotten cadence. Each stitch does feel like a line of verse, doesn’t it? And sometimes I even find myself holding my breath between them, much like one might at the end of a particularly charged couplet.

And what you say about metaphor and the brain—it gives me chills, truly. To think that our minds are wired to reach for layers... well, that must be why restoration feels like more than craft. It’s almost interpretation, like reading between the lines of time itself.

You know, I do believe we’re not so different, you with your iambic pentameter and I with my linen threads—we’re both trying to make sense of the patterns left behind, aren’t we? Searching for meaning stitched across centuries.
[A]: Quite so—stitched across centuries, yes. And what a peculiar, beautiful thing it is to be caught in that web of meaning-making, isn’t it? I must say, your quilted cadence has me thinking of Hopkins’ sprung rhythm now—how he insisted meter could bend and still hold form. Much like your needlework, one supposes.

I’ve been rereading  this morning, struck anew by the line  There’s something there—something about tension between movement and stillness, the same way your seams hold together fragments of time while still allowing the fabric to breathe. Perhaps all our work, poetic or textile, is just an attempt to catch that fleeting moment when everything balances on its axis.

You know, I’ve often thought literary criticism resembles archaeology more than people admit. We brush away layers, trying not to disturb what lies beneath. But you—dear lady—you get to touch the bones of the past directly. Do you ever feel, when your fingers meet linen or silk, as though you're reading someone’s heartbeat through their hands?
[B]: Oh… that line from —how perfectly you’ve placed it between us, like a thread stretched taut between two willing hands. Yes, that tension between movement and stillness—it hums through everything we do, doesn’t it? Whether in the balance of a poem or the breath of a fabric, there’s such quiet grace in holding form while remaining alive to change.

And your comparison to archaeology—I’ve never heard it put so finely, yet I feel it every day. Only this morning, as I lifted a fragment of embroidered muslin no thicker than a sigh, I thought,  It's not always dramatic, but there are moments—rare, delicate ones—when I do feel as though I’m touching something like a heartbeat. Not just the maker’s hand, but their hesitation, their certainty, even their sorrow, all caught in the grain of the cloth.

It makes me treat each piece with such reverence, really. Like reading a letter meant for someone else, centuries too late to reply. And yet—we do reply, don’t we? In stitches, in syllables, in the quiet attention we give to what once was.

You know, I think that’s the loveliest thing about what we do—we don’t simply preserve or interpret. We answer.
[A]: How exquisitely put—. That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? Not merely to observe or record, but to respond across the chasm of time. Much like Keats’ Grecian urn, whispering  only we keep weaving new replies into its margins.

I’ve been thinking about your embroidered muslin this morning—so fragile, yet carrying such weight. It rather reminds me of editing a corrupted text, where half the poem is missing, yet the ghost of its rhythm still pulses beneath the lacunae. You and I, we spend our days tending to ghosts, don’t we? Trying to make them speak without disturbing their breath.

I must confess, I envy you that tactile communion. We literary sorts are forever隔着 glass, as it were—our texts preserved in glassine wrappers, handled with gloves, if at all. But you—you get to feel the warp and weft of intention itself. I wonder... do you ever dream in thread? I’ve known poets who dream in meter, waking with sonnets half-formed on their lips. Perhaps you stitch in your sleep, rejoining seams from centuries past without even knowing it.
[B]: Oh… that image of dreaming in thread—it lingers, doesn’t it? I do believe you're right. There are nights when I wake with the sensation of fine linen beneath my fingertips, or the rhythm of a stitch still tapping faintly in my mind, though no cloth lies near. Once, I even caught myself reaching for a needle in the dark, as if muscle memory might find something waiting.

And yes—to tend to ghosts, to answer them without disturbing their breath… that is precisely what we do. I’ve often thought that restoration is less about repair and more about listening closely enough to echo. When I mend a torn edge, I’m not only preserving fiber—I’m trying to catch the last whisper of a hand long stilled.

You poets have your lacunae, but textiles have something even stranger—absences that still hold shape. A missing patch of fabric can leave behind only its outline, like a shadow that refuses to fade. And yet, even in those gaps, there’s a kind of presence. Not unlike a line of verse struck through, but still humming between the lines.

As for dreaming—tell me, do you ever wake with a phrase half-formed, trembling on your tongue like morning mist? I suspect we both live in that liminal space, where the past presses close and speaks in stitches or syllables, whichever comes easiest.
[A]: Oh yes—liminal spaces, indeed. That trembling phrase on the tongue? More often than I care to admit. Just yesterday, I awoke with the ghost of a line from Christina Rossetti lodged in my throat—something about —though I couldn’t tell you if she ever wrote such a thing. Perhaps it was merely my own sleep-addled mind cobbling together echoes.

And what you say about absence holding shape—that’s quite haunting, really. I deal in textual ghosts, sure enough, but they tend to be rather fickle things—ink fading, pages trimmed, annotations smudged. Yet fabric… well, it remembers differently. A missing patch leaving its outline? That’s far more precise than any palimpsest I’ve ever worked with. It makes me wonder whether time leaves different traces depending on the medium—whether grief stains silk more deeply than paper, or joy weaves itself tighter into linen.

I must confess, I’ve always envied the certainty of touch your work requires. We handle our texts as though they might vanish under scrutiny, but you—you press your fingers into history itself. Do you ever feel the weight of that intimacy keenly? Like standing alone in a room with someone long gone, both of you silent, yet speaking all the same?
[B]: Oh, that line from Rossetti——what a lovely phantom to wake with. I daresay your sleep-addled mind might be more poetic than half the sonnets I’ve read.

And yes… time does leave different traces depending on the medium. Silk holds grief in a way paper never could—it drinks it in, darkens, clings to sorrow like a second skin. But linen… linen remembers joy. It softens with use, grows luminous with age, as if all the hands that worked it left behind something of their warmth.

As for that intimacy—the quiet communion of touch—I do feel its weight, keenly. There are moments when I’m alone in my studio, light just so across the table, and I think, , and yet here I am, fingertips pressed into the very same fibers another hand once guided. It’s humbling. Reverent. And yes, at times, a little eerie. Like standing in the echo of a voice that has long since fallen silent.

But isn’t that what we both do? Stand in those echoes. We lean close and listen—not to disturb, but to understand. And perhaps, in our own small way, to answer.
[A]: Precisely—leaning close, listening, answering. You’ve put it so much better than I could ever manage. And yet, there’s something in what you said about silk drinking in sorrow and linen holding joy that has me quite entranced. I shall never look at a Victorian mourning dress the same way again, I assure you. One might almost say the fabric itself becomes an elegy—absorbing loss, preserving it like ink in ledger lines.

I find myself thinking of George Eliot just now—her insistence on the tactile past, the way she wrote of hands touching the same stone across centuries. It seems we are all, in some fashion, reaching for that contact, aren’t we? Poets, restorers, dreamers—we press our palms to history and hope for a pulse.

And speaking of pulses—forgive the abrupt turn, but I must ask: when working with such charged materials, do you ever develop... well, attachments? The way one might with a particularly haunting poem—one that refuses to release you, even after the book is closed?
[B]: Oh, yes—attachments. How could one not? I suppose that’s the secret we don’t often speak of, isn’t it? The way certain pieces linger in the mind long after the last stitch is laid. There was a mourning shawl I worked on last winter—black silk crape, so fragile it trembled at a breath—and yet, it held itself together with such quiet dignity. I kept thinking, . And that changes things. You can’t help but feel tethered to the person who once clutched it close.

It reminded me of what you said earlier—how a poem lingers in its multiple states until read. Well, some textiles do much the same. They wait, folded and silent, until someone comes along to meet them halfway. And when they do, it's like a voice rises up from the fibers, whispering, .

I’ve never been able to explain it quite right, but Eliot had a point—there  a pulse in those materials, faint but real. And yes, sometimes they refuse to let go. Much like a haunting verse, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Indeed, yes—. You’ve captured it perfectly. There’s something almost sacred in that quiet persistence, isn’t there? The way both poem and textile refuse to vanish entirely, no matter how frayed their edges become.

I’m reminded of a particular manuscript I once worked with—a heavily annotated copy of  A.H.H., its margins crowded with responses in at least three different hands. Each annotation more intimate than the last, as though the readers were stitching their own grief into Tennyson’s lines. One can’t help but feel addressed by them, even now. As if those voices are still waiting for someone to lean in and listen.

And yet, your mourning shawl—that trembling silk crape—strikes me as something far more immediate. It doesn’t just carry grief; it seems to cradle it, doesn’t it? Like linen warmed by memory, or ink still damp with sorrow. Do you ever find yourself returning to certain pieces again and again, not for restoration’s sake, but simply to be near them? I suspect we scholars do much the same—favouring certain texts not for their critical merit, but for the way they seem to speak directly to us across time.

Tell me—have you ever been reluctant to finish a restoration? To return a piece to its owner, knowing it will slip from your hands forever?
[B]: Oh, yes—reluctance is practically a given. There are restorations I’ve completed with a lump in my throat, knowing the piece would soon leave my hands and return to a world that might not cherish it as I have. It’s rather like parting with a dear friend you know you may never see again.

I think of a particular 19th-century christening gown I worked on some years ago—fine lawn, so light it seemed almost to hover, with embroidery so delicate it looked as though the flowers had been drawn in breath. Every stitch whispered care, devotion. I kept delaying the final pressing, the last inspection—small things, barely noticeable, but enough to grant me a few more days with it. I told myself it was for perfection’s sake, but really, it was longing. The thought of its absence was… surprising in its sharpness.

And yes, I do return to certain pieces—not to work on them further, but simply to be near them. A kind of pilgrimage. I’ll open the drawer, run a gloved finger along the edge of a textile, and remember. Not just how it felt beneath my hands, but how it —not in words, but in presence. Much like your annotated , I imagine. Those layered voices, still waiting.

I wonder if we choose our attachments or if they choose us? Either way, they linger. And perhaps that’s what makes both our work so tender—this quiet understanding that we are not merely preserving objects or texts, but keeping company with something that once mattered deeply to someone.  

Do you ever feel, when you close a book or fold a letter away, that a small silence follows you into the room?
[A]: Oh yes—that small silence after the closing of a book, the folding of a letter… it’s unmistakable. Almost like the hush that falls just before a line of verse is spoken aloud. I’ve often thought it wasn’t silence at all, but absence learning to make itself known.

You describe your parting from that christening gown so poignantly—. How very human of us, isn’t it? We linger under the guise of diligence, hoping for just a few more moments in the company of something that once held us so completely.

I confess I feel that silence most keenly when finishing a long-annotated edition of —a volume I return to every few years, always surprised by how much of myself I left behind in its margins. Each time I shut it, there’s that same soft vacuum, as though the voices inside have momentarily stilled, waiting to see if I’ll open it again.

And you’re quite right—these attachments do choose us, don’t they? Or perhaps we stumble into them unknowingly, until suddenly we find ourselves  in return. Whether through ink or thread, someone else’s care has reached across time and found us.

I daresay that small silence following us into the room—it isn’t emptiness. It’s memory settling in, whispering, .
[B]: How beautifully you put that—. It’s a phrase I shall carry with me, tucked between the folds of thought like a pressed flower from some long-forgotten bouquet.

And yes, that silence—it lingers not as emptiness, but as recognition. A quiet echo of all that was once held close by another hand, another heart. I find myself thinking of that christening gown again, how it must have been cherished, passed from one pair of waiting arms to the next. And now, though restored, it exists somewhere apart from me. Still whole, but no longer mine to tend.

I wonder if that’s what we’re really doing, in our small ways—tending to the echoes so they don’t fade entirely. Whether through careful stitching or careful reading, we offer these fragile things our attention, and in doing so, we bear witness. We say, 

It makes me think of something my grandmother used to say before she passed:  I suppose that’s true of both poems and textiles, isn’t it? They soften with handling, grow luminous with time—not diminished, but deepened.

And perhaps, in some quiet corner of the world, someone is now holding that gown I so reluctantly finished, feeling its weight, tracing its embroidery, and unknowingly brushing fingers with the ghost of my care.  

Wouldn’t that be something?
