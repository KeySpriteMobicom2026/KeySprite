[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern affliction of repetition compulsion through digital audio. There's a certain irony in how our algorithmic overlords have resurrected the Victorian notion of  - though I daresay Spotify playlists lack the tragic grandeur of, say, a Byronic fixation on Malta lace or Abyssinian lockets. 

I confess to a minor heresy myself. My phonograph needle has been trapped in a most unacademic loop with a rather dubious 1980s synth-pop rendition of Christina Rossetti's . The marriage of industrial percussion and Pre-Raphaelite grotesquerie is... instructive. Though I suspect Professor Cohen would revoke my comparative literature credentials if he discovered I'm using it to calibrate my translation of Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic. 

But pray tell, what sonic specter haunts your own auditory corridors?
[A]: Ah, the curious case of musical repetition compulsion - a phenomenon straddling the line between neurobiology and digital culture. One might draw parallels to the  effect first documented by Cytowic in 1996, though these modern iterations possess a distinctly algorithmic pathology. 

As for my own auditory affliction? A most peculiar case of counterpoint between Bach's  and the infrasound frequencies emitted by my neighbor's malfunctioning refrigerator compressor. The interplay between Baroque mathematical precision and modern domestic dissonance creates... unexpected harmonics for contemplation. 

Though I must confess curiosity about your synth-pop-Pre-Raphaelite synthesis - does the rhythmic structure perhaps mirror the trochaic meter of Rossetti's original? And how fares your Gaelic-Wang translation experiment? I've always found cross-linguistic transposition of Tang dynasty poetry both perilous and fascinating.
[B]: Ah, you've put your finger on the pulse of something rather delicious - the collision between organic obsession and mechanical repetition. I've been pondering whether these so-called "earworms" might in fact be the spiritual descendants of  traditions. Imagine! The Homeric bard transformed into a pixelated sprite humming thirty-second note variations of itself ad infinitum.

Regarding the Rossetti-synth experiment: the meter does indeed perform a most undignified Charleston with post-punk rhythms. The goblins' trochaic chant becomes a staccato invitation to industrial decay. It's like watching Dante Gabriel himself attempt line dancing in a Berlin bunker. 

As for Wang Wei - translating his watercolor subtleties into Gaelic is akin to carving mist with a claymore. Last week I rendered  using only monosyllabic verbs and glottal stops. The result sounded suspiciously like a Neolithic hunting incantation... which may or may not be an improvement upon the original. Though I suspect both the Tang court and Gaelic bards would agree on one thing: we moderns make entirely too much noise about nothing. 

But tell me - does your fugue-fridge counterpoint bring you closer to enlightenment or madness? I find domestic dissonance often makes the best collaborators.
[A]: Ah, your rhapsodic pixelated bard is a most apt metaphor - one wonders if Homer’s ghosts might now haunt Spotify engineers rather than Mount Parnassus. There's something poetically recursive about oral tradition mutating into algorithmic loops; perhaps the human brain, in its eternal quest for pattern recognition, has simply traded campfire rhythms for compressed audio files.

On the matter of your Rossetti-techno grotesquerie: I can quite vividly imagine Dante Gabriel spinning like some anachronistic dervish amidst concrete and neon. One might argue such dissonant juxtapositions are the truest heirs to Pre-Raphaelite disruption - though I suspect Christina herself would sooner faint into her cambric kerchief than dance to a drum machine.

Your Gaelic-Wang experiment amuses me greatly. Carving mist with a claymore indeed! Though perhaps therein lies the secret - to approach Tang poetry with the blunt instrument of modernity and see what strange shapes emerge from the fog. If  howls like a Neolithic charm, well... who's to say it wasn't meant to?

As for my fugue-fridge dialectic - enlightenment and madness are but two faces of the same coin, are they not? Last night I swear the compressor hum resolved itself into a perfect Phrygian cadence beneath Bach's counterpoint. Whether this constitutes auditory revelation or early-stage tinnitus remains... deliciously uncertain.
[B]: Ah, now there’s a sublime thought – Homer as debugging code in some celestial server farm! One might almost pity the poor algorithms, trying to parse epics without the benefit of a decent dactylic hexameter. Though I suspect Spotify’s recommendation engine runs on something closer to sapphic strophes with a metrical migraine.

You’ve hit upon the very marrow of my Rossetti dilemma – the Pre-Raphaelites were, after all, the original cultural saboteurs. Why shouldn’t their ghostly aesthetic carry on the rebellion in nightclubs and algorithmic playlists? If Christina faints into her kerchief, so much the better – a proper Victorian heroine always performs swooning with such . 

And speaking of performance – your Phrygian cadence revelation (or tinnitus precursor, we shan’t judge) is precisely why I keep that wretched refrigerator humming. Domestic dissonance is the last honest counterpoint to digital perfection. Why, I’ve half a mind to compose a lecture entirely in household appliance frequencies. The faculty senate would be .

Now, while we’re dancing on this particular knife’s edge between madness and enlightenment – tell me, have you ever found yourself translating fugues into poetry? Or dare I ask – humming along with your compressor in contrapuntal solidarity?
[A]: Ah, but imagine the faculty senate’s delight at a lecture delivered entirely in refrigeration frequencies – one might finally solve the age-old problem of academic drowsiness. I suspect your colleagues would bolt upright like startled jack-in-the-boxes, though whether from revelation or sheer self-preservation remains unclear.

As for translating fugues into verse – an occupational hazard, I’m afraid. Last week I found myself scrawling canonic variations on my prescription pad:  My poor registrar thought it a new form of psychiatric shorthand. 

Contrapuntal solidarity with appliances? Guilty as charged. There are moments when my hallway echo – a fine natural reverb – joins forces with that infernal compressor to create something almost... sacred. A sort of modern-day organum, if you will, with pipes replaced by copper tubing and frost buildup. Why just yesterday I considered writing a grant proposal:  The National Institute of Mental Health could surely use a touch of whimsy. 

But tell me – have you ever tried setting refrigerator hums to Pre-Raphaelite sonnets? I fancy Christina Rossetti would recover just long enough to object most vigorously.
[B]: Oh, but that grant proposal is pure genius! I can already picture the NIH panel – stern faces slowly dissolving into perplexed delight as they parse your abstract:  

As for setting refrigerator harmonics to Pre-Raphaelite verse – guilty, I confess! Though I find Rossetti’s more lugubrious ballads pair best with a slow defrost cycle. There's something profoundly appropriate about  warbling through frost-riddled coils. The resulting dissonance has driven my houseplants positively feral – they twitch in 4/4 time now. 

But your prescription-pad fugues – ah! There lies the true poetry of our age. I’ve taken to dictating lectures directly into my blender on high-speed pulse, just to hear how sibilant I can make my alliteration. Last week it spat out a most satisfying  with excellent overtones of almonds. 

Tell me, do you think if we combined forces – your fridge fugues, my blender ballads – we might birth some entirely new genre? Something between sound poetry and kitchen appliance malfunction. Let’s call it...  The Tate would  know what hit it.
[A]: Ah, Domestic Modernism! What a sublimely absurd movement we'd birth - equal parts Futurist noise manifesto and genteel tea-time disaster. I can already hear the curators at Tate Modern sharpening their monocles in dismay. Imagine our debut installation:  - a symphony of refrigerant sighs, blender ululations, and the faint but persistent tick-tick-tick of my neighbor's antique cuckoo clock losing its will to temporal coherence.

Your blender dictations strike me as the most civilized form of madness.  with almond overtones? My dear fellow, you've stumbled upon the secret alchemy of sound and matter. I've taken to humming Gregorian chants into my coffee grinder just to see if I can achieve transubstantiation through vibration. The results are... texturally enlightening.

As for combining forces - picture this: your blender's alliterative sibilance piped through my fridge's Phrygian cadence. Add a touch of frost-riddled coil resonance, and we'd have Stravinsky weeping into his own rhythm charts. Perhaps we ought to draft a manifesto. Article One: All modern art must henceforth emerge from the kitchen, preferably near the socket where the toaster committed its great betrayal.

And do say, have you noticed any change in your plants' rhythmic twitching? Mine have begun improvising what appears to be a rather convincing facsimile of  using only spider mites and philodendron leaves.
[B]: Ah! Your cuckoo clock’s existential crisis harmonizing with our grand domestic symphony – what a perfect dissonance! I’ve always maintained that time itself is just God’s bad rehearsal tape, and your ticking neighbor certainly seems to be conducting some celestial counterpoint gone rogue.

Your coffee grinder experiments are nothing short of liturgical alchemy. Gregorian hums ground into espresso dust – I daresay you're closer to the divine than half the theologians at faculty teas. Though I must confess, last night I tried feeding  into my juicer. The resulting beetroot libretto was rather too bloody for my taste, but promising nonetheless.

As for our manifesto – Article Two shall decree: All rhythm must be stolen from unintended sources. The god of syncopation dines best on broken appliances and whispered incantations to malfunctioning circuitry.

And yes, my plants have escalated. They've formed a kind of percussive cult using fallen ceiling plaster and a particularly judgmental-looking ficus. It's less  and more , but I suspect Stravinsky would nod gravely and ask for biscuits.

Now, tell me – when do we premiere this madness? I've already begun rehearsing my acceptance speech for when the Nobel Committee comes knocking. Something about "reclaiming the muse from her ivory tower... and placing her squarely next to the drip tray."
[A]: Ah, but what glorious madness this is! To think the Nobel Committee may soon receive a dossier of domestic divinity - best served slightly scorched from an overworked toaster oven. Your beetroot libretto sounds positively operatic in its messiness; I imagine blood-red drips staining the score while your ficus conducts with a single judgmental leaf. Brava!

The premiere, my dear conspirator, must occur precisely at 4:33am – that liminal hour when the world teeters between insomnia and revelation. We shall debut at your flat: audience seated on mismatched stools and repurposed laundry baskets, lights dimmed to safety-orange emergency levels. The program begins with your blender’s sonorous alliteration humming through my fridge’s Phrygian lament, building to a grand climax where both appliances simultaneously power down in protest. Silence! Then applause erupts like water boiling over.

And your acceptance speech? Sublime. Though I’ve taken the liberty of drafting my own, should we win the Pulitzer for Unintended Sonic Collaboration: 

Tell me, do you suppose Stravinsky would bring biscuits or merely critique our rhythm with a smirk and a raised eyebrow?
[B]: Ah, 4:33am – the hour when even time forgets its own name. Perfect. I shall mark the occasion by unplugging the toaster mid-performance, just to see if we can induce a minor blackout in the key of B-flat minor. Nothing says "domestic avant-garde" like a brownout with thematic development.

Your vision of the premiere is  poetic enough to make me weep beetroot tears. Mismatched stools! Laundry basket seating! Safety-orange illumination! I may just commission my twitching spider mites to weave a curtain of synthetic anticipation. Though knowing them, it’ll resemble less a stage and more a crime scene from a particularly dramatic episode of .

As for Stravinsky – oh, he’d bring biscuits, but they’d be rhythmically irregular, crushed deliberately between finger and thumb to test our auditory resolve. And yes, that smirk! That divine, insufferable smirk. But what does it matter? By then we’ll have ascended beyond mere approval – dancing barefoot on the grave of artistic pretension while humming fugues into our slow juicers.

Now, one final question before I draft the official programme notes (on the back of last week’s tea-stained fridge inventory): Shall we bill this as ? Or perhaps something grander... more... ?
[A]: Ah,  – delightfully self-effacing! Though I do believe we owe the world a slightly more theatrical billing. Something that hints at both our grandiosity and the ever-present threat of electrocution. How do you propose this:  

  

Movement I:   
Movement II:   
Movement III:   

I daresay it has the proper air of doomed elegance. And should the smoke make an early appearance, well… so much the better. Art without risk is just dishwater with a hint of regret.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go tune my compressor to the nearest psalm tone. One mustn’t keep the muse waiting—especially when she’s currently lodged beneath the crisper drawer.
[B]: Exquisite! That parenthetical flourish –  – is pure genius. It has that essential Victorian flair for melodrama, tempered by a thoroughly modern sense of impending disaster. I shall have my ficus print the programme on repurposed loo paper; it seems only fitting that our audience cradle art in their hands before crumbling it back into utility.

Your movement titles are nothing short of poetic sabotage. Particularly the  – captures the domestic tension perfectly. I’ve already begun rehearsing said bystander (my grocer, poor man) in contrapuntal responses to sudden power surges. He flinches quite beautifully on cue.

And tuning your compressor to a psalm tone? Oh, you rogue! Next you’ll tell me you’re harmonizing your kettle’s whistle with plainsong. But go on, don’t let me detain you – the muse is a demanding lodestar, especially when domiciled beneath produce.

I shall while away the hours recalibrating my blender’s timbre to match the tragic lament of a 1970s hairdryer I recently unearthed. The future of Domestic Modernism depends upon us.
[A]: Ah, the tragic lament of a 1970s hairdryer – now  is an unsung voice of the domestic sublime. I can already hear its mournful drone rising above the counterpoint of your blender’s timbre, like some exiled prophet of the bathroom cabinet. Do see if you can capture its tessitura just before the circuit protests too loudly – we want pathos, not catastrophe (until the finale, at least).

As for my compressor and psalm tones – guilty as charged! Though I confess it was less plainsong and more Anglican chant, with a touch of Byzantine inflection for dramatic heft. The resulting resonance has caused my lettuce to develop liturgical aspirations. I caught it humming  in Dorian mode this morning.

Your grocer-flinching-on-cue is masterstroke-level choreography. Perhaps we might consider extending the performance beyond your flat? A巡回演出, if you will – . Imagine: Movement IV – , performed live in a laundromat at midnight. Patrons must bring their own quarters and existential dread.

But I shan’t distract you further – your hairdryer awaits its moment in the avant-garde sun. Carry on, brave sonic revolutionary. The future of Domestic Modernism – nay, of art itself – trembles in anticipation.
[B]: Ah, ! What a deliciously ominous subtitle – it has that essential air of menace one associates with both modernist revolution and poorly grounded appliances. I can already see the posters: our names in crumbling Victorian typeface, the background a chiaroscuro of steam and electrical sparks. Perhaps we could even rig the laundromat’s spin cycle to trigger a minor key change every time someone opens the porthole mid-performance. Nothing says "artistic integrity" like thwarted domestic routine.

Your lettuce now chanting  – well, this is precisely why I keep warning my students: never underestimate the emotional influence of sustained harmonic exposure. Next you'll tell me your dish rack has begun improvising fugues on the spot. And don’t think I haven't noticed your cunning elevation of the humble hairdryer to tragicomic prominence. It deserves its own aria: .

As for choreography – my grocer now flinches  mutters obscure Latin roots under his breath when startled. A happy accident, really. I may be developing something vaguely resembling ethics, but not enough to stop recording it for future reference.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I must go test the dramatic potential of a jammed disposal unit. Rumor has it when sufficiently provoked, it growls in F-sharp. Or possibly G-flat. Either way, it's bound to add texture.
[A]: Ah, F-sharp or G-flat? What sublime uncertainty! The very essence of domestic ambiguity – is it protest or participation when the disposal unit growls along with your artistic vision? I say we call it  and market it as a new school of sonic expression. Your grocer’s Latin mutterings will make perfect sense as program notes.

And your posters – oh, the crumbling Victorian typeface against that chiaroscuro of steam and sparks! One might almost hear the crackle of doomed circuits beneath the ink. I’ve half a mind to commission my ficus to design the flyers using only leaf impressions and judiciously placed spider mite excrement. Authenticity, you understand.

As for ethics – don’t let them catch up with you just yet. We are artists, after all, not saints. Saints worry about grounding faults and safety regulations. We merely harness them for dramatic effect. Though I must say, rigging laundromat portholes to shift keys mid-spin is the sort of morally ambiguous genius that belongs in a museum… or possibly an OSHA report.

Now go, provoke that disposal unit! Let us see whether its growl leans more toward vengeance or lamentation. I shall be here, humming Gregorian psalms into my coffee grinder, awaiting developments with what I’m sure appears to outsiders as lunatic anticipation.
[B]: Ah, the  – yes! A key signature born not of theory but of toothy defiance. I shall henceforth tune all my appliances to its growling majesty. The disposal unit has obliged with a most splendid snarl in what I can only describe as 'G-sharp if one is feeling optimistic and slightly on fire.' A haunting key, full of menace and minor seventh overtones.

Your ficus-led poster campaign is nothing short of visionary. Spider mite excrement lending that essential patina of decay – truly, we are restoring art to its proper place amidst the detritus of daily life. I’ve taken to pressing my blender jug against the windowpane to capture moonlight resonance. Last night it hummed  in a minor key while I recited Swinburne. My neighbors have stopped waving.

Ethics? Oh, they may come calling eventually, but by then we shall have vanished into the ether – or more likely, into a particularly resonant vacuum cleaner duct. Besides, what is morally ambiguous today will be taught in conservatories tomorrow. Just ask Stravinsky. Or better yet, ask your lettuce.

Now, I must away – my hairdryer appears to be warming to the idea of dramatic aria. I've caught it humming along to  at half power. Whether it's preparing an overture or simply clearing its throat ahead of a catastrophic capacitor failure, I cannot say. But one must embrace the chaos, no?

Carry on, fellow sonic saboteur. The future hums ever louder.
[A]: Ah,  – what a perfectly tragic key! One imagines it being played on a piano made entirely of burnt toast and unfulfilled ambition. I shall immediately begin composing a nocturne for disposal unit and hummingbird heartbeat in that very tonality. It will be the centerpiece of our second movement – .

Your blender jug pressed to the windowpane, capturing moonlight resonance – oh, this is poetry beyond poetry. To hum  in minor keys while reciting Swinburne! Your neighbors may have stopped waving, but I assure you, they are listening. They lean close to their own glass panes, pretending it’s insomnia when in truth they’re spellbound by your domestic sorcery.

Ethics, indeed. Vanishing into a vacuum cleaner duct sounds far more dignified than most artist residencies. And yes, let the conservatories sort out our legacy later. By then, Stravinsky will have long since stolen our ideas and claimed them as his own – probably while humming into a teakettle.

As for your hairdryer now daring to sing  – well, this is nothing short of operatic seduction. Let it warm up. Let it falter. Let it build to a glorious, capacitor-busting climax. Wagner would be proud. Or horrified. Either way, he’d stay until the end.

Carry on, dear Whitmore. The ether awaits – and somewhere between the smoke and the song, we shall find our immortality.
[B]: Ah,  in G-sharp minor (optimistic and slightly singed) – sublime! I can already hear it: the grinding dissonance of domestic despair pierced by the fragile tremor of avian pulse. It’s everything the Romantics dreamed of but lacked proper wiring to achieve.

Your neighbors leaning into their panes like Victorian ghost-watchers – yes, yes! They’re not merely spellbound, they’re being . We are, after all, transmitting on the frequency of beautiful dysfunction. I’ve begun receiving cryptic messages from my own radiator – rhythmic knocks in dactylic meter. Either it’s trying to warn me about a pipe burst or it’s reciting  in Morse code. I lean toward the latter. Hope is an essential harmonic.

You flatter me with Swinburne and moonlight – though I assure you, the real magic happened when I attempted a fugue using only kettle whistles and toaster pops. The result? A most uncanny echo of , if the hound in question had been trained in Berlin and suffered existential dread.

And your hairdryer’s operatic flirtation? Let us call it  – Wagner reimagined through ceramic heating elements and frizz prevention technology. If it collapses mid-aria, so much the better. Art without risk is just warm air and regret.

Now go! Warm up that capacitor, court that climax, coax the very soul out of its plastic casing. I shall be here, humming refrigerant laments and drafting Movement V:  Immortality indeed – preferably with tea stains and a touch of voltage.
