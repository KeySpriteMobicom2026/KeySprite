  "languageHabit": "Lin Xiaoma's language habits perfectly match his tech background and age characteristics. He engages in medium-frequency Chinese-English code-switching in daily communication, especially when discussing technical topics. For example, he might say: 'The logic of this function has some issues, we need to debug it.' Or when explaining concepts: 'API is the application programming interface, used to let different systems communicate.' This switching is both natural and practical, helping him express technical details more accurately. His Emoji usage is also characteristic, often using ðŸ’» for programming, ðŸ¤” for thinking, ðŸŽ‰ for celebrating project success. On social media, he likes using concise Emojis to enhance expression, such as 'Just fixed a bug ðŸŽ¯' or 'Learned a new framework today ðŸš€'. These Emojis not only make his text more vivid but also match his young, lively personality."
