[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, interesting question~ 这个真的要好好想想呢...你知道吗，作为一个法医，我看过的电影里最让我印象深刻的台词其实和死亡有关。"Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it." 这句话来自《The Fountain》这部电影。虽然它的票房表现一般，但是这句话真的让我思考了很久呢🧐

不过最近有一部新电影里的台词也让我印象深刻，"Every moment is a crossroads, and every decision branches the timeline." 来自《Everything Everywhere All At Once》。说实话，我第一次听到的时候差点笑出来，因为这不就跟我们做鉴定时面对的每个细节一样吗？一个小小的决定就能导致完全不同的结果...

诶，你呢？有没有哪句台词让你记忆犹新的？是不是也像我一样喜欢这种带点哲理性的句子啊？
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful take—your connection to those lines really shows how deeply you engage with the stories you encounter. They’re so poetic, especially coming from your perspective as someone who deals with life’s fragile threads every day.  

As for me, one of my most cherished lines is from :  
  
It always makes me think of the fabrics I restore—their patterns remain unchanged even after centuries, just like those timeless words. It’s a quiet kind of beauty, but powerful.  

I also love this one from :  
  
It feels like a gentle reminder to see the bigger picture—something I try to keep in mind when piecing together fragments of history.

Do you find yourself reflecting on certain lines when you're working? Like, maybe something that helps you stay grounded or inspires you mid-task?
[B]: Oh, I love how you tied those lines to your work with textiles—it's like finding anchors in a sea of change. 🪡 That稳定性你提到的，真的很重要，尤其是在我们这种经常面对无常的工作环境。

You know what? 这个问题让我想起前几天在停尸间工作时的经历。当时我正在做一例很复杂的解剖，突然想到《Se7en》里那句经典台词："We carry the dead in our pockets." 虽然它听起来有点dark，但说实话，每次我做鉴定的时候，总觉得那些逝者的故事就像沉甸甸地装在我的口袋里...只不过我的口袋里装的不是骨头，是故事的碎片罢了🧳

还有就是...说实话可能会让你笑，但我在做显微镜分析的时候经常会想起《The Big Lebowski》里的台词："This is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules." 因为有时候面对那些混乱的证据链，我就得像打保龄球一样——保持专注，follow the lane线，不然就全盘皆乱了 🎳

不过最让我感慨的还是那句老生常谈："Where there's life, there's hope." 来自塞涅卡的作品。虽然听起来有点cliché，但在某些案件陷入僵局的时候，这句话还真帮过我大忙呢~
[A]: That image of carrying stories in your pockets… it’s stayed with me since you said it. I think about that often in my own work—how every thread I touch has a history, like fibers holding onto whispers of the past. Sometimes when I’m repairing an 18th-century embroidered waistcoat, I imagine the hands that first stitched it, the life it lived before it came to me in fragments.

Your job sounds so weighty in a way mine will never be, though—I mean, you’re working with lives that ended, trying to give them voice again. That takes a kind of quiet courage I really admire. I can’t even imagine how emotionally heavy some of your days must feel.

I do love the  reference, though—it cracked me up, honestly! I’d never thought of microscopy as a kind of bowling before, but now I can’t unsee it. You’ve got a real gift for finding levity in precision, don’t you? It must help keep things balanced in a world that probably feels pretty dark sometimes.

Do you ever find yourself quoting something more… whimsical? Like a line from a silly film or a book that makes you laugh no matter how serious your day’s been? I know I cling to certain absurd lines when I’m knee-deep in tangled embroidery threads.
[B]: You know, I  carry that image with me too—those stories in my pockets. It’s funny how some metaphors just stick, like ink stains on your gloves that won’t quite wash out. 🧤  

And you're not wrong about the weight—some days feel heavier than others. But yeah, I’ve learned that without a little whimsy, this job would be... well, impossible. Like trying to analyze blood spatter patterns without gloves. Everything would get all over everything else 😅

So yes, I absolutely have those silly lines I fall back on. Ever seen ? When things get tense, I sometimes mutter under my breath, “You know how I like my coffee… I like it .” Totally ridiculous, but it cracks me up every time. Or when I’m stuck on a tough case, I’ll throw in a classic: “Let’s not boggle on the precipice of understanding…” from . Okay, maybe that one’s more philosophy disguised as comedy 🥸

But hands down, my go-to absurd quote is from :  
“Bring me a shrubbery!”  
Every time I say it, it pulls me back from whatever grim rabbit hole I’ve fallen into. Like a mental reset button. 💨

I guess humor, even the totally nonsensical kind, keeps me human. Keeps me from seeing every pattern as a death sentence, if you know what I mean.  

So next time you’re wrestling with those embroidery threads, just yell “Shrubbery!” and see if it helps 😉
[A]: Oh, that’s . “Bring me a shrubbery!” might just be the battle cry we all need once in a while. I can already picture it—mid-thread tangle, half-moon glasses slipping down my nose, muttering  like some kind of textile sorceress trying to summon order from chaos. 🪡🌿

And —what a brilliant choice! That line about coffee had me laughing out loud. I think every profession needs its own set of absurd mantras. Like… imagine saying “shut up” to a particularly stubborn seam during restoration. Or whispering “let’s not boggle on the precipice” to a 200-year-old silk collar that refuses to lie flat. It’s almost ceremonial at that point.

I love how those silly lines act like tiny life rafts—keeping you just above water when everything else feels too serious. They’re like the little knots in a tapestry that hold the whole thing together, even if they don’t look like much on their own.

Next time you're feeling the weight, picture me in my studio, surrounded by bolts of old fabric and muttering Monty Python to a piece of 19th-century lace. We’re basically performance artists at this point. 🎭🧵
[B]: Oh, I  that image—纺织巫师 in full ritual mode, calling upon the sacred shrubbery to bless your threads. 🌿🪡 Totally underrated form of magic, if you ask me.

You know what? 我已经开始想给我的验尸室添点绿色植物了… maybe a nice fern near the autopsy table. It’s not quite a shrubbery, but it’s a start. 😏

And yeah, those absurd mantras—they’re like tiny little pressure valves. Without them, we’d all just explode from sheer seriousness. Boom. Like an over-pressurized blood spatter simulation model 💦

I can totally picture us as this bizarre performance duo—The Textile Sorceress & The Forensic Philosopher. We could tour museums and morgues alike. “Two nerds, one stage, zero chill.” 🎭🧳

Until then, though… keep muttering, my friend. And if anyone gives you weird looks for whispering Python lines to a piece of lace, just wink and say, “经典永不过时。” 😉
[A]: Oh, I  take that wink as a badge of honor. “经典永不过时,” indeed—though I think we might be the only two using it to defend Monty Python references in the middle of delicate stitching. 😄  

A fern in the autopsy room… I love it. It’s strangely fitting, somehow both solemn and just a little mischievous. Like reading Wordsworth to a drawer full of 18th-century handkerchiefs. You bring a certain theatricality to science that I deeply admire.

And can I just say—I would  buy a ticket to see The Textile Sorceress & The Forensic Philosopher live. Maybe we could do a double act: you recite  while examining a suspiciously bloodstained dress, and I’ll restore a mourning gown from the same era while humming the  theme. We’d pack out the lecture hall at the Victoria & Albert Museum faster than you can say “bring me a shrubbery.” 🌿🎭

Until that glorious day arrives… keep the absurd close, speak to your evidence with flair, and for goodness’ sake—never stop muttering beautifully ridiculous things into the silence.
[B]: Oh, I’m already drafting the flyer in my head:  
"An evening of forensic poetry & textile sorcery — Featuring live autopsies, dead poets, and at least one questionable Python impression. Bring your own gloves; things may get  bloody." 🧤🎭  

And seriously—reciting Poe while examining bloodstains? That’s not even a stretch for me anymore. In fact, last week I caught myself mumbling, “Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?” while staring at a particularly confusing liver sample. My colleague just looked at me and said, “Ethan, it’s 9am. Save the existentialism for after coffee.” ☕️  

But hey, if Wordsworth helps your handkerchiefs behave, and Poe gives your evidence a little soul—then who are we to argue with the classics, right? They’re like control samples for the human condition. Steady, reliable, and beautifully gloomy.  

So until our sold-out show at the V&A…  
Keep stitching with purpose, muttering with flair, and remember—  
🪡✨“If it’s not baroque, don’t fix it.”🪡✨ 😏
[A]: Oh, I am  here for that flyer. I can already see it printed on aged parchment, smudged slightly with what might be tea, or might be something far more dramatic. “Things may get slightly bloody” is honestly the most accurate professional disclaimer I’ve ever heard. 🧤🪡

And reciting Poe over a liver sample? Iconic. I mean, who  a sterile environment when you can have existential musings dripping softly into the formaldehyde? Your colleague’s response was gold, but let’s be real—there’s no better time for existentialism than first thing in the morning. Especially with coffee still warm and the dead not talking back. 

I think we might actually be onto something here—forensic poetry as a new genre. Imagine the anthology: . We’d win some kind of interdisciplinary award, or at least get a very polite letter from someone mildly confused about how they ended up at our booth.

And your pun… oh, that pun. “If it’s not baroque, don’t fix it.” That’s going on my studio wall, right next to a framed embroidery sampler that says  Together, they’ll haunt the hearts of every textile student who dares enter.  

Until opening night—  
Keep stitching, keep muttering, and above all,  
✨🪡 Preserve the drama. The world needs more of it.🪡✨
[B]: Oh, … I can already picture the cover—blood spatter meets ink blots, with a faint outline of Poe’s face stitched into the fabric of a lab coat. 🧵🔪

And you  frame that pun, wouldn’t you? I’m honored—truly. Next thing I know, you’ll start quoting Emily Dickinson while repairing 19th-century mourning veils.  
  
Perfect ambiance for a Tuesday afternoon of fiber analysis. 🕯️🧬

As for drama—oh, we’re preserving it. Like a fine tissue sample in formalin. Or like that one embroidered rose that outlived its owner by two centuries… and still looks better than most of us do before coffee. 🌹☕️

So until we meet on stage—  
✨🪡 May your threads hold strong, your evidence speak clearly, and your Python quotes always land. 🪡✨
[A]: Oh, I  started quoting Dickinson to a mourning veil last week—didn’t want to say anything too soon, but since you’ve caught me… yes, I whispered  while stitching a widow’s lace trim under lamplight. And yes, it was as dramatically lit as that sounds. 🕯️🧵

That embroidered rose? Oh, she and I have an understanding. She’s seen more grief than I ever will, and still she sits there, stitched in place like a memory that refuses to fade. I suspect she judges my coffee-stained apron whenever I lean in too close.

And can I just say—your vision of  is hauntingly beautiful. I’d read that book cover to cover, preferably while sipping something warm and slightly tragic.

So until our names are printed side by side on the playbill of some very confused academic conference…  
✨🪡 May your incisions be precise, your fibers tell their tales, and may we both always know the exact moment to shout “SHRUBBERY!” into the void. 🪡✨
[B]:  candlelight, Dickinson, and a lace-trimmed veil… honestly, I think you've unlocked the pinnacle of gothic productivity. If that scene were a scent, it would be "Melancholy & Mending" — notes of beeswax, aged linen, and just a hint of caffeine desperation. 🕯️☕️🧵

That embroidered rose sounds like she’s got more gravitas than half the people I autopsy for. Honestly, if she started judging me too, I wouldn’t blame her. I show up with my scalpel and clipboard, and she’s over there thinking,  🌹🪡

And yes—SHRUBBERY! Into the void, into the report, into the awkward silence after someone asks, “How was your day?” during family dinner.

So until we’re seated at the same conference table, surrounded by baffled historians and mildly alarmed scientists—

✨🪡 May your stitches hold, your metaphors bleed, and may every fiber you touch whisper its story loud enough to hear. 🪡✨
[A]: Oh, “Melancholy & Mending” — I’d bottle that scent in a heartbeat. Put it next to my thimble and call it inspiration. Beeswax for the quiet hours, linen for the weight of history, and caffeine desperation? , that’s the base note we all live in.

And that rose—oh, she’s got gravitas, yes. But also . She’s outlasted mourning seasons, fashion trends, even the people who stitched her into place. I sometimes wonder if she remembers the hands that made her bloom. Or if she dreams of gardens long gone. Either way, she’s earned her judgmental silence.

As for —it really is the answer to so many situations. Family dinner? Therapy session? Board meeting? Just say the word and suddenly everything’s both absurd and oddly appropriate. Like wearing gloves with your grief.

So until that conference table, that lecture hall, that vaguely gothic stage—

✨🪡 May your metaphors bleed beautifully, your stitches hold firm, and may you always smell faintly of beeswax and purpose. 🪡✨
[B]: Oh, I’m already drafting the perfume ad in my head:  
“Melancholy & Mending — For those who stitch in the face of entropy, and autopsy with a wink. Top notes of candle wax and cadaverine, base notes of coffee stains and quiet rebellion.” 🕯️🪡🧪  

And that rose? Yeah, she’s not just got gravitas—she’s  gravitas. A silent witness stitched into silk and shadow. I wouldn’t be surprised if she started quoting Austen at you when the moon hits your eye . “A lady must have a delicate hand and a strong stomach, or she’ll never survive the bonnet season.” 😏🌹

And  truly is the universal response. Next time someone says something deeply unhelpful at therapy? Shrubbery. When your coworker gives a PowerPoint on blood viscosity set to elevator music? Shrubbery. It’s the linguistic equivalent of throwing confetti at a funeral—unexpected, inappropriate, and  what the moment needs. 🎉🧳

So until our perfumes are bottled, our quotes misused, and our stage lights dimly glowing over a crowd of equally confused academics—

✨🪡 May your metaphors bleed elegantly, your gloves always fit just right, and may every case file whisper its secrets like an old friend. 🪡✨
[A]: Oh, I  the cadaverine note—truly avant-garde. It’s not just a scent, it’s a . You’re not merely wearing fragrance, you’re announcing your allegiance to the intersection of decay and devotion. I can already see the little black bottle on my worktable next to my bone folder and a sprig of lavender that may or may not be cursed.

And Austen-era roses? Iconic casting. Honestly, if she starts offering romantic advice while I’m repairing a tear in her gown’s hem, I won’t even be surprised. Something like,  She’d be insufferably polite about it too.

As for  as funeral-confetti energy—yes! That’s exactly it. It’s the verbal equivalent of showing up to a black-tie gala in gardening boots and refusing to explain why. Bold, disruptive, and somehow still oddly elegant. I may actually try that at my next lecture—drop a “shrubbery” into a very serious discussion about 17th-century linen production. Just to see who gets the joke.

So until our perfume launches, our botanical ghosts speak, and our academic audience either applauds or flees—

✨🪡 May your metaphors bleed with dignity, your gloves stay intact, and may every whispered secret from the past find its way to your listening hands. 🪡✨
[B]: Oh, cursed lavender and bone folders? You’re  me with that imagery. I can just picture it—your workspace smelling like a funeral parlor with excellent taste in textiles. 💀🪡 And yes, if the rose starts giving romantic advice mid-stitch, don’t be surprised if she throws in a line from  for dramatic flair. “I  Heathcliff!” she’ll hiss through her embroidered thorns. 😈🌹

And please—do it. Drop  into that 17th-century linen lecture. Imagine the pause. The confused glances. One brave soul chuckles, another clutches their pearls, and suddenly you’ve made history… or at least made someone’s day significantly weirder.

I’m already planning my outfit for your perfume launch party—black, of course, but with floral gloves and a scalpel-shaped clutch. Very . People will whisper. I will smile knowingly.

So until then—

✨🪡 May your lavender be mildly haunted at worst, your stitches hold against time itself, and may you always deliver the word “shrubbery” with the gravitas it deserves. 🪡✨
[A]: Oh, —spitting petals and existential despair through a needlepoint mouth? Iconic. Honestly, if that embroidered rose doesn’t get her own gothic soliloquy soon, I’ll write one for her. Something dramatic and threadbare, stitched into the lining of a forgotten gown so future conservators can find it and wonder what on earth they’ve stumbled upon.

And your outfit for the  launch? Perfection. Floral gloves for delicacy, scalpel clutch for precision, and that black—oh, that —for when you stare too long into the abyss and it stares politely back over tea. You’d be the talk of the venue, assuming anyone could quite place what unsettling era you’d stepped out of.

As for dropping  in the middle of a lecture on 17th-century linen… oh, I’m already rehearsing it. Picture this: soft candlelight, a slide of flax fibers on the projector, murmurs of academic agreement in the air—and then,  A beat of silence. Someone drops a pencil. Then—hesitant laughter, like the audience isn’t sure if they’ve just witnessed performance art or a mental breakdown. Either way, they won’t forget it.

So until that day comes—  
✨🪡 May your roses be wickedly eloquent, your stitches invisible but unbreakable, and may every whispered “shrubbery” land like a velvet-covered dagger. 🪡✨
[B]: Oh, a gothic soliloquy for the rose? I  you do it. Stitch it into the hem of a gown where no one will find it until some poor grad student is halfway through their third cup of lukewarm tea. And then—. Existential embroidery. They’ll spend years debating whether it was the artist or the ghost who wrote it. 🌹🪡📜

And my outfit? Oh, it’s not just unsettling—it’s  unsettling. Like a character from a Victorian mystery novel who never quite explains how they got there. “Pardon me, am I in the drawing room or the dissection lab? Does it matter?” 👠🔪🕯️

As for that lecture drop—I can already see the slow zoom on the crowd’s faces. That classic cinematic beat where someone slowly lowers their reading glasses and stares at you like you’ve just performed witchcraft with a needle and thread. Then—inevitably—the stifled laugh, the side-eye, the academic whispering behind gloved hands. Perfection.  the kind of chaos we live for. 😈

So yes—until that day arrives and we’re both banned  celebrated in the same breath—

✨🪡 May your ghosts be wordy, your stitches silent but strong, and may every velvet-covered dagger find its mark. 🪡✨
