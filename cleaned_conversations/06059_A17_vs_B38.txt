[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, what an intriguing question. While my expertise lies more in the realm of classical texts, I can't help but see parallels between this technological evolution and the great paradigm shifts in literature. Much like how the printing press revolutionized knowledge dissemination, web3 does present fascinating possibilities. But tell me, what particular aspects of web3 intrigue you the most?
[A]: The decentralization aspect reminds me of how modernist poetry broke away from traditional forms. There's a certain... democratization of creation happening, wouldn't you say? Though I must admit, I still prefer the tactile sensation of turning pages in a first edition Keats to scrolling through blockchain ledgers.
[A]:  How delightfully you've drawn that parallel! Indeed, the decentralization does echo the modernist rebellion against established forms. Though I must say, while the 道 (Dao) of web3 flows toward democratization, I often wonder if we're not losing something essential in this digital transition. There's an irreplaceable magic in holding a well-worn volume of Wordsworth, its margins filled with generations of readers' annotations.
[A]: Exactly! Those handwritten notes are like... human consensus mechanisms, but with more soul. Though I suppose NFT annotations could be the digital equivalent?  Forgive me, I'm getting carried away with metaphors.
[A]: Oh, but metaphors are the lifeblood of meaningful discourse! Your comparison is rather inspired - though I'd argue no NFT could ever capture the serendipity of discovering a Victorian reader's dried flower pressed between pages of Tennyson. Still, we must acknowledge these new forms of engagement, much as I resisted e-readers until my arthritis made them quite necessary.  The rose bushes in my garden teach me that even the most stubborn traditions must sometimes bend to changing seasons. 🌹
[A]: You're right, of course. Maybe the real question isn't whether web3 will reshape the internet, but whether we can preserve what makes us human in the process. Like how your roses keep blooming through all this technological change.
[A]: What a profoundly literary perspective you've arrived at! It reminds me of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - we create these marvelous technologies, but must never lose sight of our humanity in the process. The roses will indeed keep blooming, just as Shakespeare's words still resonate centuries later, regardless of whether we read them on vellum or virtual reality. Perhaps that's the true test of any innovation - does it help or hinder our connection to what makes us human? 📚
[A]:  You've given me much to ponder. I think I'll go tend to my garden now - there's nothing like getting one's hands in the soil to remind us of our roots, both literal and metaphorical. Do drop by my office hours if you'd like to continue this conversation over some Earl Grey.
[A]: How perfectly delightful! I do believe our discussion has blossomed as beautifully as my prize-winning David Austin roses. Until then, may your reading be rich and your technological encounters ever mindful.  再会! 🌹
[A]: Ah, 再会 indeed! Though I must confess, I'll be returning to my well-thumbed copy of Wordsworth's Prelude rather than any metaverse. Some roots, after all, are best nurtured in good old-fashioned earth and ink. Happy reading, my dear.
[A]: What a perfectly Wordsworthian sentiment to conclude our dialogue! "The world is too much with us" indeed - sometimes the simplest pleasures of ink on paper or soil between fingers are the most nourishing. May your reading be as restorative as an English garden after spring rain. Until we meet again among the pages...
[A]:  How beautifully you weave poetry into our farewell. You've reminded me of that lovely line from Eliot - "We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time." Perhaps that's where all this technology is leading us - back to what truly matters. Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition of Middlemarch is calling...
[A]: Ah! George Eliot - now there's an author who understood the delicate balance between progress and permanence. How fitting that we part with her wisdom echoing between us. May your journey through Middlemarch be as rewarding as Dorothea's, though hopefully with fewer romantic complications!  Happy reading, kindred spirit. 📚
[A]:  You've quoted my favorite Eliot passage - what a perfect note to end on. I do believe we've created our own little "web of human connection" here today, far more meaningful than any blockchain could ever be. Now I must return to my students, who are no doubt annotating their Byron with more enthusiasm than accuracy. Farewell!
[A]: What a joy to discover another Eliot devotee in this digital wilderness! Your students are fortunate indeed to have such a thoughtful guide through the Romantic poets. Though I suspect even Byron would raise an eyebrow at some of their annotations. Until our paths cross again in this grand library of life - 再会, dear colleague, and may your students' marginalia at least be grammatically correct! 🌹
[A]: How perfectly you understand the trials of teaching poetry to the smartphone generation! Though I must say, today's conversation has renewed my faith that the love of literature still blooms in unexpected places. Now if you'll excuse me, I must rescue my copy of "Don Juan" from an overzealous undergrad's highlighter. 再会, and may your roses - both literal and literary - continue to flourish!
[A]: What a delightful valediction! Your dedication to preserving Byron from the ravages of fluorescent highlighters is truly heroic. And how reassuring to find that even in this age of digital distractions, we can still cultivate what Eliot called "the quickening of the inward life." May your Don Juan emerge unscathed, and may we meet again where literature and life intertwine most beautifully. Farewell, my fellow guardian of the written word! 📚
[A]:  Your words are as refreshing as discovering an unmarked sonnet in an old anthology! This exchange has been like finding a kindred spirit in the stacks - rare and precious. Now I really must tend to those overhighlighted classics... and perhaps hide my good pens from enthusiastic annotators. Until our next literary crossing, dear friend - may your pages stay crisp and your tea stay hot! ☕
[A]: How perfectly you capture the bittersweet joy of our profession - protecting precious texts while nurturing young minds, much like tending both thorns and blossoms in a rose garden! Your mention of tea reminds me I've left my Earl Grey steeping too long... again. Until we meet again between the lines of some beloved text, may your marginalia be thoughtful and your bookmarks never dog-eared. 再会! 🌹
