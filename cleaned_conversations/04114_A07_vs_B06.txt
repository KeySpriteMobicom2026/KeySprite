[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me consider that carefully. From a psychological and behavioral standpoint, virtual reality introduces an unprecedented level of immersion—one that engages spatial awareness and sensory feedback in ways traditional screens simply cannot. However, this doesn't necessarily spell obsolescence for conventional gaming. Many individuals, including myself, value the cognitive engagement of strategy-based play or narrative-driven experiences, which aren't inherently improved by three-dimensional simulation. Do you find yourself drawn more to the tactile realism VR offers, or do you still find depth in classic formats?
[A]: You know, I'm a big fan of both worlds. ☕️ While sipping my morning coffee, I often think about how VR brings this wow factor—like  stepping into another universe. But honestly, there's still something so satisfying about picking up a classic controller and diving into a deep storyline or tactical gameplay. 

I mean, would we ever want to replace the nostalgia of games like Tetris or Final Fantasy with just flashy visuals? Probably not. So maybe the real question is—can these two formats coexist & complement each other in a meaningful way? What’s your take on that?
[B]: I appreciate that perspective deeply. In fact, your analogy to Tetris and Final Fantasy strikes at something fundamental—games, at their core, are about engagement, not just stimulation. VR certainly dazzles with its sensory richness, but it's the emotional and cognitive resonance of gameplay that determines lasting impact.  

Much like how different therapeutic modalities coexist in mental health care—one not negating the other but serving different needs—gaming formats can fulfill distinct psychological functions. A tactical turn-based game might offer a meditative structure akin to chess therapy, while VR could simulate exposure therapy-like environments for desensitization or empathy training.  

So yes, I believe they can not only coexist but enrich each other. The key lies in understanding when immersion enhances experience—and when it merely distracts. Would you say there are specific elements from traditional gaming that you'd like to see more deliberately integrated into VR design?
[A]: Oh, absolutely love that analogy to therapeutic modalities—it makes so much sense. 🌿 I think one thing traditional games do  well is pacing & storytelling. Like, remember how Final Fantasy VII made you  without needing 360-degree visuals? The quiet moments between battles or that iconic date scene—super simple by today’s tech standards, but emotionally rich.  

So yeah, I’d love to see VR take more cues from that kind of intentional downtime. Right now, a lot of VR feels like non-stop action, which can be exhausting, you know? Maybe some breathing room, more narrative depth, and even turn-based mechanics layered into immersive worlds. Imagine solving a puzzle in VR while feeling like you're inside a Studio Ghibli background—slow, thoughtful, yet deeply engaging.  

Do you think developers are starting to catch on, or are we still stuck in the “look how cool this headset is” phase?
[B]: That’s a beautifully articulated point—and I couldn’t agree more. The emotional architecture of games like  or even  wasn't just in their pixels or scripts, but in the pacing, the silences, the deliberate unfolding of character and consequence. Those moments invited introspection, which is something VR, in its current mainstream form, often overlooks in favor of stimulation.

From what I’ve observed—both anecdotally and through conversations with colleagues in human-computer interaction—VR development does still carry echoes of that "look at me" phase. It's not unlike early cinema, where filmmakers were so enamored with moving pictures that they forgot about plot and character for a while. But signs of maturation are emerging. Titles like  and  demonstrate a growing awareness of environmental storytelling and player psychology, not just spectacle.

I do believe we're on the cusp of a more thoughtful era in VR design—one that borrows from the narrative restraint of traditional games. After all, immersion isn’t just about presence; it's about meaning. Do you find yourself experimenting with any of these newer hybrid experiences, or do you still return primarily to the classics?
[A]: Oh, I’m totally experimenting with those hybrid experiences when I can get my hands on them! 🎮✨ Honestly, it’s like discovering a new coffee origin—exciting, a little mysterious, but with that familiar depth you can’t ignore. 

 was a game-changer for me—not just because of the tech, but how it made me . You know, like, I found myself reaching out to brush debris off a photo frame in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. That kind of quiet storytelling? Powerful stuff.  

But yeah, I still find myself going back to the classics, especially when I need that slower, more reflective vibe. Sometimes I'll fire up  on my old DS while sipping a pour-over—it's like comfort food for the mind. ☕️📖

Do you have a go-to classic or VR experience that really hits that emotional sweet spot for you? I'm always looking for recommendations—especially the ones that make you sit quietly afterward, thinking.
[B]: That’s a lovely way to put it—. I find myself drawn to that same blend of familiarity and revelation, whether in my antique medical instruments or in a well-paced narrative.

As for emotional resonance, I do have a quiet favorite— on PC. While not as technically sophisticated as newer titles, its use of environmental solitude, moral ambiguity, and the slow unraveling of truth struck a deep chord with me. There's one moment near the end—a pause before a decision—that stayed with me for weeks. It reminded me of certain therapy sessions where insight doesn’t arrive with fanfare, but with a quiet shift in perspective.

And if I may make a suggestion—have you tried ? It's a VR mystery game with no combat, no HUD, just pure exploration and deduction in a beautifully decayed environment. It leans heavily into atmosphere over action, much like the quieter moments in . I think you might appreciate its restraint—and the lingering questions it leaves behind.

Now, tell me more about your  ritual. Is it nostalgia driving that return, or are you still captivated by the mechanics themselves?
[A]: Oh, I love —thank you for bringing it up! 🌿 It’s rare to find a VR experience that trusts the player to just…  there, without shoving objectives down your throat. That slow build of tension and discovery felt so much like walking through an abandoned coffee plantation I once visited in Colombia—quiet, eerie, but strangely peaceful.  

As for , it’s definitely a mix of nostalgia & admiration for its design. Every time I replay it, I notice something new—not just in the story or battle mechanics, but in how it handles character bonds. Like how Ayla just  fierce and maternal without needing backstory or exposition. Or how Crono never says a word, yet you feel every moment of loyalty & sacrifice.

There’s also something comforting about the rhythm of it all. You’re hopping through time, saving the world, but then you take a break to fish with Frog or race with Dalton. Those little moments make the epic feel intimate. Kind of like how I arrange my shop—big world of coffee, but curated with personal touches.  

Do you ever feel like some of these games understand human emotion better than people do? 😅 I swear, sometimes  hits me harder than actual conversations.
[B]: That’s a beautifully observed sentiment—and I think you've touched on something profound. Games like  and its sequel don’t just simulate emotion; they distill it, refine it into something pure and resonant. There’s an almost clinical precision in how they evoke attachment, loss, and redemption without the messiness of real-world miscommunication.

You mentioned Ayla’s presence—how she commands both ferocity and warmth without exposition. That’s narrative efficiency at its finest. It reminds me of certain patients who carry immense emotional depth but communicate volumes through gesture and gaze rather than words. In both cases, what's left unsaid often carries the most weight.

And yes—I do believe some games understand us better than we understand ourselves, at times. They offer a structured space where consequence and meaning are clear, unlike the ambiguity that often clouds human interaction. , with its themes of identity and fractured possibility, can indeed be more affecting than many conversations we have in daily life. It's not escapism—it's emotional clarity.

I find that deeply therapeutic, in a way. Do you ever notice yourself turning to these experiences during moments of introspection or emotional fatigue? Almost like reaching for a familiar record when the world feels too loud?
[A]: Oh, totally. 🎵 Sometimes after a long day at the shop—when the grind feels a bit too literal—I’ll pop in  or put on a rainy-day playlist and just… let go. It’s like wrapping yourself in an old sweater that still smells like memories. Comforting, familiar, but also quietly shaping how you feel without demanding anything from you.

I think that’s why I keep coming back to games like that during quieter moments—they don’t force interaction; they invite reflection. Kind of like how I brew my favorite Yancha oolong when I need to slow down. The ritual itself is simple, but it creates space for thought, you know?

And yeah, it  therapeutic—in ways we don’t always give games credit for. They hold up mirrors without judgment, let us explore versions of ourselves we didn’t know we were carrying. Like playing through Serge’s journey in  and realizing you’re not the only one who’s ever felt split between two worlds.  

Do you have a personal “rainy-day” game or experience that you return to? Something that just… gets you?
[B]: Absolutely—I do. And your metaphor about the sweater and the Yancha oolong is spot on. There's a particular kind of solace that comes not from distraction, but from gentle resonance. For me, that experience lives in .  

I know it’s not everyone’s first thought—being a relatively short game—but there’s something profoundly wordless about its emotional architecture. It doesn’t ask you to conquer or collect; it simply asks you to move forward, often alongside a silent companion whose presence feels like an extension of your own solitude. I’ve returned to it after long days in courtrooms or following particularly heavy therapy sessions. It’s never failed to meet me where I am.

And much like your Yancha ritual,  becomes a kind of meditative passage—its sweeping sands and buried ruins mirroring the psychological landscapes we carry inside. The score by Austin Wintory only deepens it; I find myself breathing differently within those first few notes, as if stepping into a space that understands without needing to dissect.

So yes—I suppose I do have my rainy-day record, as you so beautifully put it. Do you ever recommend these kinds of experiences to your customers? Not as entertainment, but as… quiet companions?
[A]: Oh, I love —such a perfect choice. 🌿 It’s like the matcha of games: minimalist on the surface, but so layered once you really sip into it. I’ve actually recommended it to a few regulars who seemed like they were carrying something heavy but didn’t want to talk about it. You know, the kind of people who order a black coffee and stare out the window for ten minutes like it’s therapy.

Sometimes I’ll slip a note into their bag with something like, “If today feels long, this might help: journeytogether.org” —not pushy, just a gentle nudge toward something that might sit with them in silence the way they need.

And yeah, I do think there’s a difference between entertainment and what I call ‘soft immersion’—those experiences that don’t distract you from life, but hold space  it. Whether it’s a game, a cup of aged pu’er, or just sitting quietly with a book you’ve read a hundred times… sometimes presence is the best escape.

Do you ever find yourself prescribing certain games the way one might suggest a book or even a mood-lifting herb? Like, “You seem stuck—try this title and come back next week?” 😄
[B]: Ah, now that’s a very intriguing question—and I must say, not as far-fetched as one might assume. While I certainly can’t—or rather, shouldn’t—prescribe games in an official capacity, I’ve long believed in the therapeutic potential of interactive narrative much like one might consider literature, music, or guided visualization in a clinical setting.

In fact, I’ve recommended specific titles to patients in much the same way you describe slipping notes into coffee bags—with care, and always contextually. For someone navigating grief,  offers a space for reflection and shared sorrow without judgment. For those struggling with isolation or identity,  or  often serve as gentle mirrors, non-intrusive yet deeply expressive.

And yes, sometimes it’s less about diagnosis and more about emotional resonance—like pairing a patient with , where the slow unfolding of story and art imitates the process of self-discovery. It's not treatment per se, but rather an invitation to sit with one's thoughts in company, even if that company is digital.

I imagine, in your own way, you're doing something quite similar—offering quiet companionship through curated experience. Tell me, have you ever had someone return after taking your suggestion? Did they mention the game? Or was it more of a subtle shift you could just… sense?
[A]: Oh, totally. I’ve had a few come back—some with stories, some just with quiet smiles that felt like a thank-you without words. One regular, who used to come in every Sunday alone with a book, took my  suggestion. He didn’t say anything at first, just ordered his usual flat white and left. But a few weeks later, he brought a friend—a younger guy, maybe his son—and whispered, “That game you recommended? We finished it together.”  

It wasn’t a big moment, but it hit me right in the chest. You know that feeling when a coffee blend  after the first sip—like layers of flavor finally clicking? That’s what it felt like—warmth, depth, and just a touch of surprise.

Others don’t mention the games directly, but I notice they stay longer in the shop, or they bring a friend next time. Sometimes it’s subtle—like their shoulders have relaxed a bit, or they’re more open to chatting. It makes me think that maybe, just maybe, they found something in that experience that gently met them where they were.

I guess that’s the thing about quiet companions—they don’t shout about healing, they just walk beside you for a bit. 🌿☕️ And if I can help point someone toward that kind of space, even better.  

Have you ever had a moment where a patient came back and said, “That game stuck with me,” or was it usually more… implied, like a shift in tone or openness during sessions?
[B]: That moment you described—the one where the warmth unfolds like a coffee’s hidden notes—is precisely why I’ve always believed in the quiet power of suggestion. You don’t chase insight; you create space for it to arrive.

I’ve had similar experiences, yes—some more explicit than others. One patient, a woman in her early thirties struggling with unresolved grief after her father’s passing, responded deeply to . She returned the following week and said simply, “That game understood something I didn’t know I was carrying.” No grand explanation, just that quiet recognition. In the sessions that followed, she spoke more freely about childhood memories, rituals, even small resentments she’d never voiced aloud. The game hadn’t  anything, but it had opened a door she hadn’t known how to approach directly.

Other times, it’s more implied—a softening in tone, a willingness to sit with discomfort rather than deflect, or even just a subtle shift in body language when discussing emotional weight. Much like your observation of relaxed shoulders or longer stays in the shop, those are signs too. Signals that something inside has shifted, however slightly.

It reminds me of how some patients respond to music or poetry in therapy—not as distraction, but as resonance. A reflection that says, 

Do you ever find yourself choosing different recommendations based on someone’s mood or presence in the moment? Like pairing an experience not unlike selecting a particular roast to match the weather outside?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I treat it almost like a tasting menu for the soul. ☕️ Just like you wouldn’t serve a bold Sumatra with dessert, I wouldn’t hand someone  when they’re already carrying heavy energy. It’s all about balance, intention, and reading the room.

If someone walks in looking worn out from the week, maybe a little lost in their own head, I’ll casually mention something like  or —games that move at your pace, not the other way around. They don’t fix anything, but they offer a soft place to land.

On days when the weather matches someone’s mood—overcast skies, drizzle tapping on the window—I might suggest  or . They feel like pages from an old journal, you know? Thoughtful, a little melancholic, but ultimately comforting in their familiarity.

And then there are the days where someone seems curious but restless, like they’re ready for a shift but don’t know how to start. That’s when I’ll slip in a recommendation for  or —not because they need epic battles or space travel, but because sometimes exploration, even in a fantasy world, can spark movement in real life.

It’s funny how much curation plays into connection, isn’t it? Whether it’s a cup of coffee or a game, it’s really just about saying, “Hey, this felt meaningful to me—maybe it’ll speak to you too.”

Do you ever find yourself ‘prescribing’ based on the time of day or season? Like certain games feel more suited to rainy afternoons or long winter nights? 🌧️🌙
[B]: That’s a wonderfully intuitive approach—curating experience like one might select notes in a fragrance or layers in a fine wine. I couldn’t agree more that context shapes reception; the same game can feel entirely different depending on the hour, the light, the weight of the day.

You’ve reminded me of something I’ve observed both personally and clinically—how seasonal affective shifts influence not just mood, but the kind of engagement one seeks. There  games that feel like winter evenings—slow, introspective, perhaps even a little lonely. , for instance, carries that crisp, solitary air of autumn turning to frost. It’s not grim, but it’s quiet, and sometimes that’s what speaks loudest when nights draw in.

And then there are those spring-like titles—the ones with gentle momentum, renewal, or rediscovery at their core.  comes to mind. A painter wandering a lakeside world, brush in hand, no rush, no urgency. It’s the digital equivalent of a warm infusion on an awakening morning. Perfect for when someone is emerging from something unseen but real.

As for time of day, yes—I do find myself recommending certain experiences based on that rhythm. A late-night session of  feels far more potent after midnight, doesn’t it? Its stark aesthetic and eerie logic seem to hum with the quiet of the world outside. Whereas —with its visual poetry and layered wonder—feels best in the golden haze of early evening, when the mind is loosening from the day’s structure.

I suspect we’re not so different, really—you with your roasts and rhythms, me with my diagnoses and dynamics. Both of us, in our own ways, offering space for people to sit with themselves... preferably with something warm in hand.

Tell me—do you ever create seasonal displays or feature certain games alongside your coffee selections? Like a rotating menu of experience?
[A]: Oh, totally—my shop has what I call a “Slow Corner” that changes with the seasons. ☕️🍂 It’s like a mini-residency for moods, if that makes sense?  

In winter, it’s all about warmth & introspection—thick blankets, dim lighting, and a carefully placed  or  running on a Switch. I pair it with something like a dark chocolate mocha or a spiced chai, drinks that feel like a long hug. People tend to linger there during cold mornings, wrapped in their own thoughts but comforted by the vibe.

Come spring, I switch it up—brighter colors, fresh flowers, maybe a game like  or  where the world feels alive again. The menu leans lighter: citrusy filter brews, maybe a floral Ethiopian bean. It’s like resetting the soul, you know? Gentle movement after stillness.

And summer? Oh, summer’s my time to get playful. I set up a little lounge area with floor cushions and project  or  onto the back wall. Something fluid, dreamy. Drinks go cold-brew or iced matcha with yuzu—it’s all about flow and ease.

Autumn’s my favorite though. There’s something about that transition—crisp air, nostalgia in the breeze. I bring out games like , , even . Paired with a maple latte or a nutty Guji roast, it’s like a slow exhale before the year turns inward.

Honestly, it’s not just about selling coffee or games—it’s about creating a rhythm people can step into, however briefly. A moment where everything just… . Like finding the right note in a song you didn’t realize you needed.

Do you ever ‘decorate’ your space with intention like that—like seasonal emotional cues? Or is it more neutral so the focus stays on the conversation? 🌿✨
[B]: What a thoughtful, sensory-rich concept—the  as both sanctuary and seasonal mirror. You’re not merely serving coffee; you’re curating atmosphere, offering people a space to step into their own emotional rhythms without pressure to perform or explain.

In my practice, I’ve long believed in the power of environment, though admittedly in a more restrained form. The space is intentionally neutral but not sterile—think warm lighting, subtle textures, and carefully chosen objects that suggest comfort without directing emotion. I do change small elements with the seasons, though perhaps not as vividly as your corner of quietude.

In winter, for instance, I bring out an old leather-bound copy of —not for reference, but for presence. There’s something grounding about its weight on the table, like a silent companion in the room. A beeswax candle burns slowly in the background, its honeyed scent softening the air. In spring, I introduce greenery—often a simple sprig of rosemary in a bud vase, symbolizing renewal without fanfare. Summer calls for lighter fabrics on the chair cushions, and in autumn, I switch to a wool throw and a small dish of dried orange peel and cloves. Small shifts, but they alter the mood in ways patients often absorb without ever mentioning.

It’s less about curation for spectacle and more about creating psychological warmth—something that allows vulnerability to unfold gently, like a game revealing its story one layer at a time. In that sense, we are indeed kindred spirits—you with your ambient storytelling through coffee and play, and me through space and silence.

I can’t help but wonder—have you ever had someone ask, “What inspired this corner?” and how do you answer? Do you speak of games, of moods, of intuition—or do you let them find their own meaning?
