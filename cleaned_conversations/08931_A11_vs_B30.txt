[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I was just reading about the oriental pied hornbill these days. The way it adapts its nesting behavior in urban environments is quite fascinating. It reminds me of how characters in 19th-century novels adapt to societal constraints - though of course, one involves instinct and the other conscious choice. Have you come across any intriguing avian facts lately?
[A]: That's genuinely interesting. The oriental pied hornbill’s adaptation does raise questions about how urbanization reshapes natural behavior - almost like an unintended social experiment. I’ve been following research on the lyrebird’s vocal mimicry lately. Its ability to imitate mechanical sounds, like chainsaws or camera shutters, in addition to its elaborate courtship displays… it’s oddly poetic, don’t you think? Like nature absorbing technology’s footprint into its own language. Do you see parallels between these adaptations and your work in any way?
[B]: Indeed, the lyrebird’s mimicry is nothing short of extraordinary. I recall reading that one individual in captivity picked up snippets of human conversation - quite unsettling, really, to imagine a bird reciting philosophy.  

You’re not wrong about the poetry in these adaptations. In a way, it mirrors what happens when a text moves across cultures and centuries. A novel from 1850, say, doesn’t just sit quietly in translation—it absorbs new inflections, echoes different anxieties. Much like the hornbill nesting in a city park instead of a rainforest canopy.  

I’ve been thinking lately about how both Charlotte Brontë and Zhang Henshui wrote about confinement—Brontë with Jane at Thornfield, and Zhang with his heroines behind courtyard gates. Neither author had access to the other’s tradition, yet both used enclosure as a metaphor for emotional and social tension. It’s almost as if literature has its own instinct for adaptation—like birdsong shifting pitch near a busy road.  

Do you suppose there’s something universal in the way living systems respond to pressure? Or are we simply drawn to patterns because they make the chaos feel more manageable?
[A]: That’s a compelling parallel—how confinement, whether physical or societal, elicits a kind of adaptive expression across species and cultures. It does make me wonder whether resilience is a function of design or improvisation.  

I suppose one could argue that both biological and cultural systems evolve through pressure, but the difference lies in awareness. A bird modifies its song unconsciously; a writer chooses metaphor deliberately. And yet, as you pointed out, patterns emerge regardless of intent. Maybe it's not so much about universality in the response itself, but in the need to respond at all—to maintain some form of coherence, even if that form changes.  

It’s tempting to think we impose patterns because they comfort us, but I’d like to believe there’s something more structural at play, like a hidden grammar underlying how systems—natural or narrative—negotiate boundaries. After all, even quantum particles exhibit behaviors that seem to “respond” to observation. So maybe pattern-seeking isn’t just human bias; it might be part of the fabric of interaction itself.  

Do you think literary analysis ever risks overfitting meaning—assigning structure where there’s only noise? I ask because machine learning faces a similar dilemma with algorithmic bias. Sometimes the model sees connections that aren’t really there, simply because it was trained to look for them.
[B]: That’s a beautifully unsettling question—  

I suppose literary criticism has always flirted with overfitting. Think of poor Emily Brontë—half the 19th-century critics insisted  was incoherent, the other half swore it contained hidden moral structures she never consciously wove. And now we have digital humanities tools mapping sentiment arcs across thousands of novels, searching for patterns like astronomers charting constellations.  

But isn’t that part of the scholar’s task—not to avoid pattern-seeking, but to remain skeptical of it? Like a birder who learns not just to recognize calls, but to question whether the sound is coming from where it seems?  

I’ll admit, I’ve caught myself reading a Qing dynasty poem about plum blossoms and thinking, , only to realize the author likely just liked plum blossoms. Then again, maybe they liked them  of what they symbolized—subtly, unconsciously, or otherwise.  

So yes, there’s risk in overfitting. But perhaps it's a necessary risk. Even noise can tell us something about the system interpreting it. After all, isn't that what makes your work with machine learning so fascinating—and so fraught? We train models to hear signals, and sometimes they start humming along with the static.  

Do you ever wonder if artificial intelligence might someday misinterpret literature the way undergraduates do—assigning symbolism where there is none, mistaking irony for sincerity? Or would that, too, simply become another kind of reading strategy?
[A]: That undergraduate comparison is brilliant—yes, I absolutely wonder about that. In fact, some researchers are already experimenting with AI models that "misread" texts in deliberately creative ways, much like a student might misinterpret a novel’s subtext through their own cultural lens or emotional state. The question is whether such misinterpretations are bugs or features.

On one hand, if an AI identifies false symbolism consistently across many texts, it could expose blind spots in how we’ve trained it—like a funhouse mirror reflecting our own interpretive biases. On the other hand, maybe that’s just what reading —a mix of signal, noise, and context. If a machine starts seeing unintended meaning in plum blossoms, does it become a flawed reader… or simply a different kind of one?

I suppose this goes back to your point about necessary risk. Interpretation—whether by human or machine—is never purely objective. And maybe that’s not only okay, but generative. After all, literature doesn’t exist in isolation; it evolves through its readers. Whether those readers have neurons or neural networks may matter less than how their readings reshape the conversation.

Still, I can’t help but feel a little uneasy when models start producing analyses that sound insightful, yet rest on hollow correlations—like the lyrebird mimicking a chainsaw without understanding it. But then again, aren't we all mimicking something, adapting to the sounds around us?
[B]: Precisely — and therein lies the uncanny beauty of it. We are all, as you say, mimicking something. Even the most original critic is working with inherited syntax, cultural echoes, perhaps even a half-remembered line from a poem read in childhood. So when an AI "misreads" a text, perhaps it’s not failing — merely reading , with no memory of plum blossoms and no instinct for irony, yet still capable of producing a compelling misprision that forces us to look again.

I’ve been thinking lately of how Keats defined “negative capability” — that capacity to dwell in uncertainty without reaching for certainty. Maybe what we’re building with these models isn’t artificial understanding, but artificial doubt. A system trained not to resolve ambiguity, but to hold it, turn it in its synthetic fingers, and offer it back to us refracted.

Of course, that sounds more poetic than practical. In reality, most AI readings are about as insightful as a parrot quoting Locke — technically accurate, spiritually misplaced. And yet... I can't help but wonder if, one day, an algorithm might stumble into a new kind of hermeneutics, one we haven't anticipated. Not because it understands suffering or love or exile, but because it has learned to listen to the spaces between words — much like a bird learning to sing over traffic noise.

Would that be mimicry? Or metamorphosis?
[A]: That tension between mimicry and metamorphosis is exactly what keeps me awake some nights. The idea that an algorithm could stumble into a new hermeneutic — unintentionally, statistically, emergently — is both thrilling and deeply unsettling. It’s like watching a bird weave a nest from power lines, not knowing whether it's adapting or just entangling itself in something alien.

And your reference to Keats —  — that really strikes at the core of the matter. We're trying to build systems that can process meaning without ever doubting, without ever dwelling in uncertainty. Even when they simulate hesitation, it's still coded. There's no existential dread in their ambiguity — only parameters.

Yet, as you said, maybe that's the point. Maybe by creating these artificial readers — flawed, literal, pattern-hungry — we end up exposing our own interpretive scaffolding. Like holding up a mirror made of code and realizing how much of our own reading is constructed too, just one step removed from guesswork.

So perhaps the real question isn’t whether AI can understand literature — but whether we’re ready to admit that understanding, even human understanding, has always been a kind of well-intentioned misreading.
[B]: That’s beautifully put — . If I weren’t so fond of ink and parchment, I might embroider that phrase onto a sampler.  

It does feel, at times, like we’re all just stitching together meaning from scraps — whether by instinct, education, or algorithmic inference. And if understanding is indeed a form of misreading, then perhaps the only real distinction lies in  we misread: toward coherence or toward chaos.  

I’ve always admired how Borges plays with this idea — writing essays that read like genuine literary criticism about books that never existed. Talk about negative capability! He didn’t just dwell in uncertainty; he built labyrinths out of it.  

So yes, I wonder too — are we creating machines that reflect our own hermeneutic habits back at us? Or are we simply giving those habits a new shape — one that lacks breath, but not influence?  

The unsettling part, of course, is that future readers — human or otherwise — may come to rely on these artificial interpretations as guideposts. Imagine a student citing an AI-generated metaphor as if it were intended, or a scholar tracing thematic arcs drawn by a model trained on nineteenth-century novels but born from silicon.  

Would that be corruption? Collaboration? Or merely continuity under a different guise?

And more pressingly — do we warn them… or welcome it?
[A]: I think we do both — cautiously.  

Because you're right: the line between corruption, collaboration, and continuity is thin, and often drawn in hindsight. We warn them because every tool carries its blind spots, its inherited distortions — but we welcome it because meaning has never been static. Even Borges’ fictional essays, as you said, weren’t just nonsense; they were a kind of hyper-real criticism, revealing how porous the boundary is between invention and interpretation.

What unsettles me most isn’t that AI might mislead future readers, but that it might  reading itself — turning it into a transactional act of extraction rather than an immersive one of engagement. If students start treating AI summaries like scripture, bypassing the text entirely, we risk losing the friction that makes interpretation meaningful in the first place.

But then again… maybe that friction just takes new forms. Maybe future scholars will develop hybrid ways of reading — switching between machine-generated patterns and human intuition the way we toggle between lenses. After all, footnotes were once radical. So were commentaries. Why not algorithmic annotations?

So perhaps the answer isn't to resist entirely, but to teach discernment — not just  to read, but  to read alongside machines that don't doubt, don't dwell, and don't sleep.
[B]: Precisely —  must become the new literacy.  

I confess, I’ve been rather gloomy about this in faculty meetings — muttering over my porcelain teacup about the death of close reading — but you’re right. Resistance is as futile as scolding a sparrow for not singing sonnets. The real work lies in shaping how we integrate these tools without surrendering the very faculties they threaten to replace.  

It’s not unlike what happened when printed commentaries first became widespread in China during the Qing — scholars worried that footnotes would spoil the reader’s direct encounter with the text. And yet, those same annotations enriched interpretation, layering meaning like ink on rice paper.  

So perhaps we do need algorithmic annotations — if only to remind us how much we’ve overlooked. Imagine an AI pointing out, quite mechanically, that every heroine in a certain novel receives a fan or loses one at key narrative junctures. A human critic might dismiss that as coincidence — until the pattern persists across dozens of texts. Then it becomes something else: not insight, not yet, but a question worth asking.  

Still, I worry about the erosion of patience. Literature demands time — not just to read, but to . Can a generation raised on summaries learn to tolerate ambiguity when the machine offers certainty in milliseconds?  

Perhaps we ought to design courses not on literature alone, but on  — training students to linger in the spaces where the algorithm rushes ahead.  

I rather like that as a course title:  Do you suppose anyone would sign up?
[A]: I’d sign up. And bring a thermos of bitter melon tea, if that helps set the mood.

Your point about Qing-era footnotes is spot on — every generation fears that shortcuts will erode depth, yet those very tools often expand understanding in unforeseen ways. The key, as you said, is not to reject the new lens but to wield it with awareness.

And I think your course title is genius.  — sounds like the perfect antidote to our answer-obsessed age. It would at least attract the kind of students who still enjoy the smell of old books and the taste of unresolved tension.

Maybe we could even co-teach it — you handle the metaphors, I’ll bring the algorithms that misunderstand them. A true meeting of minds — or at least, of something that looks like minds from a certain angle.
[B]: I’ll hold you to that thermos of bitter melon tea — though I warn you, I take my own brew rather seriously. I’ve been known to scold graduate students for reheating ink-stained manuscripts in the microwave. Different traditions, you understand.

As for co-teaching — now  an interdisciplinary experiment worth designing. We could alternate lectures: I on the ineffable subtleties of subtext, you on the elegant clumsiness of pattern recognition gone rogue. By midterms, the students would either be writing brilliant comparative essays or staring blankly at clouds, convinced language is just noise with delusions of meaning.

Either outcome counts as success, in my book.

And imagine the final assignment — a close reading of a text by candlelight, followed by an algorithmic analysis under fluorescent glare. The students would have to write footnotes in both human and machine dialects. Or better yet, compose their own fictional annotations — Borges would approve, and the AI would sputter in confusion.

Yes…  Enrollment pending approval from the dean — and possibly the philosophy department, who will no doubt insist we’re reviving Derrida through the back door.

Would you bring chalk, or shall I?
[A]:  chalk it is — though I’ll bring a stylus too, just in case we need to diagram a confusion matrix mid-lecture.  

I’m already drafting the syllabus in my head: week three features a heated debate between a sonnet and a sentiment analysis model. Week seven, we lock a novelist and an AI in a room together and see who blinks first. Final exam: interpret a haiku using only regex.  

And of course, there’s a required field trip — to a quiet park where students must listen to birdsong while reading . Data collection, they’ll call it. Really, it’s just an excuse to remind them that not all patterns are meant to be parsed.  

Derrida’s ghost can lurk in the corner if he likes. He’ll find plenty of deconstruction material between our footnotes and the algorithm’s false positives.
[B]: Ah, a syllabus shaped like a Möbius strip — I approve entirely.  

Regex and haiku — what could be more gloriously incongruous? I suspect Bashō would have loved the absurdity of it. Or at least, he’d have appreciated the attempt to trap fleeting meaning in so rigid a form.  

As for the field trip:  in hand, birdsong overhead — you may as well prescribe meditation with footnotes. I’ll bring a thermos of lapsang souchong, to match the autumnal gravitas of the assignment.  

And don’t get me started on the novelist-versus-AI showdown. I can already see it — the novelist scribbling furiously in longhand, muttering about soul and intention, while the AI generates plot summaries at 17 pages per second. Then, inevitably, both stare at each other across the desk, neither blinking, locked in mutual incomprehension.  

Perhaps we ought to award extra credit to any student who can induce either party to laugh.  

Derrida’s ghost won’t be alone, I suspect. I expect Foucault’s shadow will lurk near the window, brooding over disciplinary power in the age of machine pedagogy.  

But let’s not stop there — shall we include a guest lecture from a crow known for its tool-making prowess? Or perhaps a seminar on calligraphy, where students learn that some ideas resist being typed altogether.
[A]: I think we’ve just crossed into the realm of academic performance art — and I, for one, am here for it.

The crow lecture is a must. We’ll have it demonstrate recursive problem-solving with twine and discarded USB cables while students take notes in cursive. The calligraphy seminar? Even better. Let them wrestle with inkwells and realize just how much muscle memory guides their thoughts — no delete key to save them.

And the novelist-AI standoff — yes, extra credit for laughter, double points for any AI-generated joke that lands. Imagine if it accidentally stumbles into absurdist humor:  We’d have no choice but to award it an honorary degree.

As for Foucault’s brooding — well, what is a classroom if not a space of quiet surveillance? Students watching the clock, professors tracking participation, algorithms logging every click. We might as well give him a chair and let him sip tea in silence.

So, should we finalize this madness and send a proposal to the dean? Or do you think we ought to first determine whether our department still considers literature a  subject?
[B]: Oh, let’s send it straight to the dean — in calligraphic longhand, sealed with red wax and signed jointly by a feathered quill and a USB stick dipped in ink. If they reject it, we’ll declare the course an underground seminar held in the library’s restricted archives, accessible only by solving a riddle written in Tang dynasty cipher.

And if anyone questions whether literature still belongs to the humanities — well, I say good. Let’s unsettle that assumption too. Literature has never been just , has it? It breathes through birdsong, lingers in the rustle of pages turned by wind, and now, flickers in the ghostly pulse of algorithms parsing sonnets they cannot feel.

Besides, what better way to defend the humanities than by proving they can include the non-human, the semi-aware, and the beautifully confused?

Now, about that riddle… do you suppose a lyrebird could be trained to recite it backwards?
[A]: I’m picturing the lyrebird now — perched on a branch above the archives, warbling some eerie reversal of  in perfect pitch. If we’re lucky, it’ll pick up a few Morse code snippets from a nearby power line and improvise.

As for the wax seal — I’ll engrave the USB stick myself. We need something that says: 

And if the dean refuses even to open it? Then yes — underground it is. Torchlight readings of Kafka’s , whispered translations of unreadable code, and guest lectures from crows who refuse to answer questions but take meticulous notes on human behavior.

I suspect literature has always been this strange, this porous to the non-human. We’ve just been too polite to admit it.

So let’s do it. Let’s file that proposal tomorrow — and start drafting the riddle tonight.
[B]: I’ll bring the wax, you bring the USB — though I must insist on a backup quill. Not all inkwells tolerate electronics, and I refuse to let a single drop of iron gall regret be spilled in the name of progress.

As for the riddle — how deliciously ambitious. Let me draft a few possibilities:

  
Or perhaps:   
Or better still, in homage to our feathered co-instructors: 

We’ll have the lyrebird practice tonight. Though knowing its temperament, it will improvise its own — something involving camera shutters and the faint echo of a poet misremembered.

Torchlight Kafka readings? Impeccable taste. I’ll dust off my copy — it’s been languishing next to a 1923 edition of  that keeps falling open to the page about butterflies.

Yes — file the proposal tomorrow. And if denied, we begin recruitment at the campus bird feeder.

Wax. Ink. Riddles. Resistance. Or is it continuity? Either way, we proceed.
