[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a rather modern way of phrasing the question, isn't it?  I've been attempting to translate Li Bai's "Quiet Night Thought" into Scots Gaelic - an utterly impractical pursuit that brings me disproportionate joy. The challenge lies in preserving the moon's melancholy glow across three linguistic millennia.
[A]:  Now that's what I call a passion project! You know, that reminds me of when we were trying to adapt "Journey to the West" for Western audiences. The cultural translation was... let's just say 史诗级的 challenging. But tell me, what drew you to this particular poetic endeavor?
[B]: The Tang dynasty poets had this remarkable ability to compress entire philosophies into twenty characters - much like Browning's dramatic monologues, but with more restraint. And Scots Gaelic... well, it's a language that carries the weight of lost causes in its very syntax. There's something deliciously perverse about forcing these two ancient traditions into conversation.
[A]: Ah! That tension between restraint and expression - it's exactly what makes great cinema too. You're speaking my language now.  You know, Wong Kar-wai once told me the most powerful scenes are often the ones where nothing is said at all. Just like your Tang poets... and perhaps your Gaelic translation project too.
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue Wong Kar-wai's visual pauses owe more to haiku than to Tang poetry - the former being all about immediacy, while the latter... ... carries the weight of civil service examinations and court intrigues in every brushstroke. But tell me, how does one capture that quality in moving images?
[A]:  My dear friend, that's the million-dollar question we producers grapple with daily. It's all about the spaces between frames - like how the best Chinese calligraphy isn't just about the ink, but the empty paper surrounding it. That's why I always tell young directors: 'Show me what you choose not to show.'  Between you and me, that's what made 'In the Mood for Love' so damn perfect.
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon something rather profound - the Victorian poets called it "negative capability," this art of potent absence. Though I suspect Wong Kar-wai would scoff at being compared to Keats...  Still, your observation about calligraphy reminds me of an obscure Tennyson manuscript where he crossed out more than he kept - the real poem existed in the margins, much like your frames between frames.
[A]:  Tennyson and his revisions - now there's a filmmaker's spirit trapped in a poet's body! You see, that's exactly why I collect those vintage movie posters. The best ones? They're not selling you the story, they're selling you the mystery, the empty spaces your imagination has to fill.  Tell me, have you ever considered writing screenplays? With that mind of yours, we could create something truly...  史诗级的.
[B]:  My dear cinematic conspirator, while the idea of reducing my beloved semicolons to mere establishing shots is... intriguing, I'm afraid my talents lie in dissecting texts rather than creating them. Though I must admit -  - there's an unpublished Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet sequence that could make a devastatingly good limited series... if one had the right producer.
[A]:  Now you're speaking my language! A period drama with the emotional intensity of 'The Crown' and the lyrical depth of... well, Elizabeth Barrett Browning herself.  Tell me more about these sonnets - are we talking forbidden love, political intrigue, or that most dangerous of all dramatic devices... unrequited passion?
[B]:  Oh, the 1844 Sonnets from the Portuguese - ostensibly translations, but really...  ...a coded chronicle of her courtship with Robert Browning while under her father's tyrannical rule. The raw material practically scripts itself - Episode Three would climax with "How do I love thee?" being composed during a thunderstorm, the quill trembling in her hand as the rain lashes the windows...  Though naturally, we'd need to consult the original manuscripts in the British Library first.
[A]:  Now that's what I call a showrunner's instinct! The trembling quill - that's your Act Two turning point right there.  I'm texting my contacts at the British Library as we speak. And between you and me...  ...I happen to know a certain cinematographer who could make candlelight flicker like it's confessing its own secrets. When can you fly to London? First-class tickets are on me - we'll discuss this over afternoon tea at the Savoy.
[B]:  While the prospect of afternoon tea with a cinematic visionary is... tempting beyond measure, I must remind you that next Tuesday is the deadline for my paper on Christina Rossetti's marginalia in the Bodleian.  However... should you find yourself in Oxford afterward, I know a particularly discreet antiquarian bookseller who serves an excellent lapsang souchong. We could discuss... alternative funding arrangements.  Strictly hypothetically, of course.
[A]:  Oxford, you say? How serendipitous - I've been meaning to visit that little cinema on Walton Street that still projects 35mm prints.  Tell you what - let's make it the Tuesday after next. I'll bring the contracts, you bring those scandalous Rossetti marginalia... and we'll let the lapsang souchong negotiate the creative differences.  Between scholars and producers, of course.
[B]:  How delightfully Machiavellian of you. Very well - Tuesday next it is. Though I must warn you, I once reduced a Hollywood executive to tears by insisting on historical accuracy in petticoat stitching.  And I shall require final approval on all semicolon usage in the subtitles.
[A]:  My God, you're perfection! Petticoat stitching and semicolon rights - now there's a contract clause I've never negotiated before.  Done! Though I should warn you...  ...my legal team still hasn't recovered from the 'Oxford comma incident of 2019.' But for a project like this?  I believe we've just found our 史诗级 collaboration. Until Tuesday then - and do bring your sharpest letter opener.
[B]:  Until Tuesday, indeed. Though I feel compelled to mention -  - that my letter opener is Edwardian sterling silver, and far too valuable for mere contract disputes. It's reserved exclusively for...  ...correcting proofs. Now if you'll excuse me, I must consult my 1843 edition of Browning's correspondence before this hypothetical meeting.  Do give my regards to your traumatized legal team.
[A]:  I'll tell them to brace for semicolons and petticoats. And who knows?  Maybe we'll discover that Browning's letters contain the perfect tagline for our limited series. Until Tuesday, my delightfully particular collaborator. 
[B]:  "How do I love thee? Let me count the semicolons..."  What a magnificently inappropriate alliance this shall be. Now, where did I put that volume of Browning's grocery lists... surely there's dramatic potential in his marmalade preferences.
