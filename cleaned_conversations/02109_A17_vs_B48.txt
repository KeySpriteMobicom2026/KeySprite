[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, meditation and yoga? 说实话我更倾向于跑步来放松 🏃‍♂️。在解剖室待了一整天后，nothing beats a good long-distance run to clear my mind~ 不过我有同事swear by瑜伽，说对保持手术时的稳定性很有帮助 ⚖️
[A]: How fascinating! While I've never practiced yoga in an operating theater, I do find that certain poetic forms share a similar meditative quality. The measured cadence of a villanelle, for instance, can be quite centering - much like the controlled breathing in yoga. Though I must admit, my own relaxation comes more from tending to my rose garden or losing myself in a volume of Tennyson.
[B]: Interesting analogy! 从法医的角度来看，controlled breathing确实和我们的工作很配呢 🔬。每次处理复杂case时，我都会下意识地采用类似techniques...虽然我的'诗歌'都是写在验尸报告上的 📝。说到Tennyson，他的'Crossing the Bar'倒是很适合我们这行，don't you think?
[A]: Ah! 'Sunset and evening star...' - how perfectly you've made that connection. There's a certain forensic precision in Tennyson's imagery that does resonate with your profession, isn't there? The way he examines mortality with both clinical detachment and profound tenderness... rather like composing those autopsy reports, I imagine. Though I suspect your 'poems' require rather more... concrete evidence than my literary analyses.
[B]: 哈哈，完全正确！我们的'诗歌创作'确实需要更多physical evidence 💀。不过你知道吗？有时候处理cold case时，那种抽丝剥茧的过程真的很有诗意...就像解构一首复杂的十四行诗一样 🕵️‍♂️。只是我们的韵脚是DNA样本和指纹，而我们的隐喻是...well，literally blood stains 🩸
[A]: My dear colleague, you're giving new meaning to the term 'blood poetry'! Though I must say, your analogy between forensic analysis and poetic deconstruction is remarkably astute. The way you trace patterns in evidence mirrors how we trace patterns in meter and rhyme. Though I do hope your workplace smells considerably better than the musty old volumes in my office's rare books collection... formaldehyde and old parchment make for rather competing aromas, don't you think?
[B]: Oh please，我们实验室的'香氛'可是独特的混合风味呢~ 甲醛加上...let's say各种biological samples的独特气息 🧪。不过说真的，有时候闻到old books反而会让我想起大学时在医学院图书馆熬夜的日子 📚。至少我们的'藏书'都是密封在冷藏柜里的，不会发霉~ 😅
[A]: How delightfully macabre! Your 'library' of refrigerated volumes does make my collection of Browning first editions seem rather tame by comparison. Though I must say, there's a certain... permanence to your specimens that our fragile paper manuscripts can't quite match. Tell me, do you ever find yourself whispering Shakespearean soliloquies to your more... expressive subjects? "Alas, poor Yorick" seems particularly appropriate, though perhaps in questionable taste...
[B]:  拜托，我们可是professional的！...虽然我承认有时候会对着特别challenging的case自言自语 🤫。不过更多是用现代法医术语而不是莎翁台词啦~ "Alas, poor John Doe, your liver enzymes tell quite the story..." 这样？⚖️ 不过说真的，每个case确实都有自己的narrative waiting to be uncovered 🔍
[A]: What a splendid forensic narratology you've developed! Your John Doe's liver enzymes composing their own biochemical sonnet... it's almost enough to make one consider editing an anthology of 'Postmortem Poetics.' Though I suspect the Oxford University Press might need some convincing about that particular volume. Tell me, have your students ever drawn parallels between crime scene reconstruction and, say, textual reconstruction in palimpsests? The layers do rather accumulate in both our fields, don't they?
[B]: 哈！这个比喻太妙了~ 就像我们经常要处理multiple layers of trauma evidence一样 📑。我的学生确实说过类似的话...特别是处理那些被刻意掩盖的wounds时，就像在解读被反复擦写的羊皮卷 ✂️。不过我们的'墨水'是hemoglobin，而我们的'erasures'...well，let's just say有些凶手真的很creative in their editing techniques 🩹
[A]: How perfectly horrifying and brilliant! Your 'creative editors' do put my struggling graduate students' revision attempts to shame. Though I must say, your forensic palimpsests sound considerably more... vivid than our faded medieval manuscripts. Perhaps we should collaborate on an interdisciplinary seminar - 'Textual Violence: From Manuscript Marginalia to Murder Weapon Markings.' I'll bring the tea and scones, you bring the... well, perhaps just the slides this time.
[B]: Deal！不过我得警告你，我的slides可能会让scones变得less appetizing... 😅 想象一下一边看blunt force trauma的3D reconstruction一边吃司康饼的场景~ 不过说真的，这个seminar idea很有潜力！我们可以叫它"从笔迹分析到血迹分析" ✍️➡️🩸。Just promise me we won't serve red velvet cake... 考虑到主题，那可能会引发一些awkward moments 🎂
[A]:  How terribly considerate of you to spare our guests' delicate constitutions! Very well, we shall stick to vanilla sponge - a suitably neutral canvas, much like your pristine lab coats. Though I must insist we include at least one Dickinson poem about flies buzzing in deathly stillness... for academic balance, of course. Shall we say Tuesday afternoons? That gives me time to air out the lecture hall after your more... demonstrative sessions.
[B]: Perfect! 周二下午正好是我完成morning autopsy的时间 ⌛~ 我会记得带上我的'less graphic'的案例照片... maybe some nice clean gunshot wound trajectories? 🔫 Just kidding! 不过说真的，Emily Dickinson的诗歌配上我们的forensic entomology研究... 现在想想还真是个killer combination呢 💀 (pun absolutely intended)
[A]: How deliciously dark! Your puns are sharper than a scalpel, my dear colleague. Though I must draw the line at serving any 'corpse reviver' cocktails at our opening reception - let's leave those to the crime fiction writers, shall we? I'll prepare a reading list that delicately balances the lyrical and the... let's call it 'forensically illustrative.' Tuesday it is - and do remember to warn me if any of your slides require smelling salts!
[B]: Will do！不过别担心，我已经把most aromatic的案例都筛掉了 👃... mostly. 期待我们的morbidly delightful学术合作！周二见~ 记得带extra handkerchiefs，不是为了擦眼泪，而是... well，you'll see 😷 最后说一句：No dead bodies were harmed in the making of this seminar! (Okay maybe a few, but they were already past caring) 💉
[A]: What a perfectly ghastly and wonderful way to conclude our planning! I shall arrive armed with my sturdiest handkerchief and most robust Victorian sensibilities. And worry not - after thirty years of teaching Romantic poetry's more... visceral moments, I'm quite inured to shocking revelations. Though I may borrow one of your lab coats as a makeshift pinafore - bloodstains blend right in, while tea stains on tweed are simply unforgivable. Until Tuesday, my macabre muse!
[B]: Until Tuesday then！我会准备一件extra large的lab coat给你~ 毕竟我们都知道，analyzing death should never be a stain on one's reputation... even if it's literally on one's clothes 🧥😂 记住我们的slogan: "Where literature meets lividity!" ...Okay maybe we should workshop that one more time 📝 周二见！
