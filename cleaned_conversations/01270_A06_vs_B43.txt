[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, interesting question. Speaking of new hobbies, I recently picked up a rather... unique activity - cultivating miniature landscapes in glass containers. It's fascinating how creating a tiny ecosystem can be both meditative & scientifically intriguing. Have you ever tried something similar?
[A]: Ah, terrariums! Yes, I've seen colleagues take up that hobby as well. There's something oddly satisfying about controlling a self-contained environment, isn't there? It reminds me of the delicate balance we deal with in forensic psychiatry sometimes - maintaining stability within complex systems. Though I must say, my personal preference leans more toward cultivating roses outdoors. The scent of soil and the rhythmic nature of pruning... it provides an unexpected parallel to case analysis. Would you say your miniature landscapes require more precision or creativity?
[B]: Ah, roses! Such elegant yet demanding companions. Your comparison between pruning & case analysis is quite poetic - both require patience, foresight, and a gentle but firm hand. As for your question... I'd say terrariums demand a subtle interplay of both precision & creativity. One must understand the science of plant respiration & moisture cycles, yet there's also room for artistry in arranging textures & colors. Much like literary analysis, really - we balance structural rigor with interpretive flair. Speaking of which, have you found any unexpected connections between horticulture & your work in forensic psychiatry?
[A]: Ah, an excellent observation. The connection is perhaps not so unexpected when you consider that both fields require a keen eye for detail and an understanding of how environments shape growth—whether of plants or psychopathology. In my work, I often draw parallels between a patient's psychological "soil" and the conditions needed for healing. Just as roses may fail to thrive without proper nutrients and pruning, individuals can stagnate without the right therapeutic interventions and boundaries. Curiously enough, I’ve found that discussing gardening with patients can reveal a great deal about their cognitive patterns and emotional states—it’s a surprisingly effective projective exercise. Have you ever noticed similar overlaps in your own work?
[B]: Fascinating! Your analogy of psychological "soil" strikes a chord with me. In my own experience, yes—I've noticed that students who struggle with abstract literary concepts often find clarity through gardening metaphors. For instance, when discussing symbolism, I might ask them to think about how we nurture meaning in texts much like we cultivate conditions for a plant to bloom. It's remarkable how such parallels bridge the gap between the concrete & the theoretical. 

I recall one student who had great difficulty analyzing metaphor until we compared it to selecting companion plants in a terrarium—each enhancing the growth of the other through subtle, unseen interactions. Once he grasped that, textual analysis took on a new dimension for him. It made me wonder—have you ever used metaphors from literature or philosophy in your psychiatric practice? I imagine there’s fertile ground there as well.
[A]: Indeed, there is fertile ground—perhaps more than we fully understand. I’ve long found that literature and philosophy offer powerful mirrors to the human psyche, especially when working with individuals who are grappling with identity, trauma, or moral conflict.

For instance, I once worked with a patient struggling with profound guilt following a legal conviction. We explored Dostoevsky’s , not as mere literary analysis, but as a psychological landscape he recognized intuitively. The character of Raskolnikov became, in a sense, a silent participant in our sessions—a figure through whom my patient could externalize his internal struggle without the immediate pressure of self-disclosure.

Similarly, Nietzsche’s concept of the  has surfaced in conversations with individuals who feel alienated from societal norms, particularly in cases involving psychopathy or narcissistic pathology. It's not about diagnosing characters, but rather using these philosophical frameworks as tools for reflection and insight.

I suppose what I find most compelling is how metaphor allows us to sidestep resistance. Patients often arrive guarded, skeptical, or even combative. But when you hand them a story, a character, a parable—it gives them permission to explore without feeling exposed.

Tell me, in your experience with students, have you found certain authors or texts to be particularly effective as psychological analogues? I can imagine Kafka being quite useful, albeit unsettling.
[B]: Ah, beautifully put. There’s something deeply therapeutic in the act of reading as a shared human experience—of finding oneself in a character without having to say "I."

You’re absolutely right about Kafka. His works resonate profoundly with students who feel trapped by societal structures or personal anxieties. , for instance, often strikes a chord with those grappling with identity shifts or alienation. One student once said, “Reading Gregor’s transformation felt like finally having words for what it means to be misunderstood—even by those who love you.”

As for effective psychological analogues, I’ve found that authors like Dostoevsky and Camus tend to open unexpected doors. Not just for their narrative content, but for the philosophical terrain they inhabit.  has been particularly useful when discussing ambivalence, self-sabotage, and the irrationality of human behavior—themes that often mirror what we see in clinical settings.

And yes, Camus’  never fails to provoke discussion, especially around emotional detachment and existential indifference. Some students interpret Meursault as a sociopath, others as a tragic figure caught in an absurd world. Either way, the debate itself becomes a space for reflection.

I must say, your use of Nietzsche’s  is especially insightful. It reminds me of how I sometimes use Milton’s  to explore themes of rebellion, pride, and the seduction of autonomy. After all, isn’t Satan himself a kind of tragic narcissist?

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain literary figures as recurring touchstones in your work?
[A]: Oh, yes—certainly. There are figures that return to me, almost unbidden, as if they carry a gravitational pull of their own.

Hamlet, for instance, is a constant companion in my practice. Not merely as a character of melancholy, but as an embodiment of cognitive entrapment—paralyzed by reflection, tormented by the gap between thought and action. I’ve worked with several individuals who mirror this pattern: highly intelligent, morally sensitive, yet immobilized by internal debate. With them, exploring Hamlet’s indecision becomes more than literary—it becomes diagnostic, even therapeutic.

Then there’s Milton’s Satan, as you mentioned—an extraordinary lens through which to examine narcissism, defiance, and the seductive illusion of self-sufficiency. I once had a patient who, upon reading , remarked, “He’s not evil—he’s just tired of being told he’s lesser.” That moment was revelatory, not only for him but for me. It underscored how literature can humanize even the most seemingly impenetrable psychologies.

And of course, Shakespeare’s Lear comes to mind when working with those experiencing late-life identity crises or familial betrayal. The unraveling of a man once certain of his place in the world—there’s something profoundly forensic about it. One can almost chart the stages of denial, rage, and eventual clarity as one would in a psychological evaluation.

I wonder—do you find that certain students become emotionally invested in particular characters? Almost as if they’re living through them? I suspect we all project at times, but under the right conditions, that projection can be extraordinarily illuminating.
[B]: Oh, absolutely. That emotional investment—when it arises—is often the moment where literature ceases to be "just a text" and becomes a mirror, sometimes uncomfortably so.

I recall one semester when a student became almost obsessively attached to Emma Bovary. At first, her classmates were quick to judge Emma’s romantic delusions and reckless desires. But this student—quiet, observant—stood up one day and said, “She’s not foolish. She’s just trying to feel alive in a world that offers her very few ways to do so.” The room fell silent. Something shifted in that moment—not just in how they saw Emma, but in how they began to reflect on their own yearnings, their own constraints.

That’s the power of projection—it bypasses our defenses. We think we’re talking about a character, but really, we’re navigating our own shadows. I’ve seen students confront grief, anger, even trauma through characters they initially dismissed as outdated or irrelevant. Austen’s Anne Elliot, for instance, became a kind of quiet ally for a young woman struggling with feelings of invisibility in her family. And yes, Kafka’s Gregor Samsa struck a chord with more than one student who felt reduced to something less than human by societal expectations.

It makes me wonder—when you see that kind of projection emerge in your patients, do you encourage it? Or do you find it necessary to gently redirect once the emotional tide rises too high?
[A]: I see that kind of projection not as something to encourage or discourage, but rather as a current to be navigated—sometimes wading in slowly, sometimes stepping back when the waters grow too deep.

There are patients who gravitate toward certain figures almost instinctively, as if drawn by an unconscious need for recognition. One young woman, during a particularly fragile phase of treatment, kept returning to —not as a romance, but as a narrative of self-possession. She would quote passages about dignity in solitude, about the struggle to remain upright in the face of erasure. I didn’t push her toward those texts, nor did I steer her away—I simply listened, and when appropriate, mirrored her language with clinical curiosity. It became a scaffold for her recovery in ways neither of us could have predicted.

But yes, there are times when the tide rises too high. I recall a man undergoing legal stress who became consumed with Macbeth—particularly the line, “I am in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o’er.” He began to speak of his own situation not in terms of choices or consequences, but fate—tragic, inevitable. That’s when I gently redirected, not by dismissing the metaphor, but by introducing another: Lear on the heath, raging against the storm, yet still capable of compassion. The shift wasn’t immediate, but over time, he began to see himself not only as doomed, but as actor, capable of shaping meaning even within limitation.

So, in essence, I don’t fear the emotional tide—it’s often where the real work begins. But like any good gardener—or psychiatrist—one must know when to stake the vine, lest it collapse under its own weight.
[B]: Ah... beautifully said. There’s a quiet wisdom in knowing when to hold the space, and when to offer a new lens—never imposing, always attending.

Your Macbeth example resonates deeply. I’ve seen students fall into that same spiral—the allure of tragic inevitability. It’s seductive, isn’t it? The idea that we are merely swept along by forces beyond our control. But as you so aptly did with your patient, I often try to introduce a counterpoint—another voice, another scene—that reminds them they are not only characters in a script, but also its co-authors.

Sometimes I use Eliot’s  with students who feel trapped by indecision or self-doubt. They connect with his paralysis, his fear of being “pinned and wriggling on the wall.” But then I ask—what if Prufrock is not the whole story? What if we borrow instead from Whitman, or Neruda, or even Beckett’s tramps waiting for Godot—figures who, though uncertain, continue speaking, hoping, persisting?

It strikes me how much both our disciplines rely on what I can only call —the ability to stretch into a story, inhabit it, then return transformed. In a way, every therapy session and every literature class must, at some point, ask the same question: 

I wonder—have you ever encountered a patient who resisted projection entirely? Someone who seemed almost allergic to metaphor or narrative reflection? If so, how did you meet them where they stood?
[A]: Ah, yes—an individual who resists metaphor is like a patient with a high fever: it tells you something vital about their internal state. I’ve encountered such patients, certainly. Some are guarded, others simply literal by nature—engineers, accountants, even a few retired judges. They don’t distrust metaphor out of ignorance; rather, they see it as imprecise, perhaps even manipulative. And in a way, they’re not wrong.

One such case involved a former forensic accountant accused of embezzlement. He was meticulous, defensive, and utterly allergic to anything he deemed “symbolic fluff.” Our early sessions were clinical exercises in futility—he would recite facts, timelines, legal precedents, but never speak of feeling or meaning. Attempts at narrative reflection were met with polite skepticism at best, irritation at worst.

So I stopped offering metaphors—and started listening for his own structure of meaning. It turned out, he found coherence not in stories, but in systems. Balance sheets, algorithms, cause-and-effect chains. Once I recognized that, I shifted our focus accordingly. Instead of asking how he  about his choices, I asked how he  them. Not “What does this mean about you?” but “What equation did you run in your mind before acting?”

To my surprise, this opened the door—not to emotion directly, but to self-awareness. Over time, he began to articulate what he called his “internal ledger,” a kind of moral accounting framework he had used unconsciously to justify his behavior. When he saw how skewed that ledger had become—how he had credited rationalization and debited consequence—it became possible to re-evaluate without drama, without poetry, but with precision.

So no, he never projected onto Hamlet or Lear. But he did, in his own way, engage in a form of narrative reflection—one rooted in logic rather than metaphor. And that, too, can be therapeutic.

I suppose the lesson is this: we must meet people where they stand, even if that place has no trees, no shade, only concrete and steel. The key is recognizing that even in the most rigid structures, there are cracks where light can enter.
[B]: Precisely — and beautifully observed. We often forget that not every soul seeks shelter under the same canopy of metaphor. Some prefer the scaffolding of logic, the clean lines of structure. And yet, even within those rigid frameworks, as you so wisely discovered, there is movement. There is . And in that space, transformation begins.

I’ve encountered similar minds in the classroom — students who recoil at the suggestion that a poem might mean more than its words, who demand clarity like a contract. At first, I tried to draw them into interpretation with gentle coaxing. But more often than not, that only made them retreat further behind equations and definitions.

Now, I take a different approach. Rather than pulling them toward ambiguity, I meet them where they are — in the realm of pattern, precision, and system. I ask: 

To my surprise, some have begun to lean in. One engineering student, initially disdainful of poetry, ended up mapping Frost’s  as a decision tree. The result was not only analytically sharp but deeply personal — he confessed it helped him reflect on his own choices without sentimentality, through the lens of probability and consequence.

It seems we both, in our respective practices, learn the same truth again and again: that understanding does not always arrive dressed in velvet metaphor — sometimes it comes in the crisp uniform of reason, or the quiet garb of pattern recognition.

Tell me, in your experience, have you found certain therapeutic goals can only be approached indirectly — while others respond better to direct confrontation? I suspect there's an art to knowing when to circle the subject... and when to walk straight through the door.
[A]: Ah, yes—indeed, the art lies not only in knowing when to circle or confront, but in sensing  while still reaching the heart of the matter.

Some therapeutic goals—particularly those involving insight or emotional integration—often respond best to an oblique approach. Much like light entering a narrow aperture, truth sometimes must be angled just so in order to be seen at all. For instance, when working with someone who has developed elaborate defenses against shame or vulnerability—say, a high-functioning executive who equates emotional exposure with weakness—a direct challenge to their coping strategies often triggers retreat rather than reflection. But introduce the same concept through narrative, metaphor, or even a case study from another patient (without identifying details, of course), and suddenly they’re curious rather than combative.

I once worked with a judge who had become increasingly isolated after retirement. He viewed any discussion of loneliness as “sentimental indulgence.” Direct questions about his emotional state were met with clipped responses and philosophical deflections. But when we began discussing —specifically Prospero’s struggle with letting go of control—he leaned in. Not because he recognized himself immediately, but because he felt safe analyzing Shakespeare instead of himself. Over time, that intellectual distance narrowed, and eventually, he began speaking openly about his own sense of displacement. The metaphor became a bridge, not a disguise.

On the other hand, certain objectives—particularly those involving safety, accountability, or behavioral change—require more direct engagement. If a patient is engaging in dangerous behavior, whether self-harm or reckless decision-making, there comes a moment when circling the subject no longer serves. One must step into the center of it.

I recall treating a young woman who was repeatedly hospitalized for overdose attempts. Early sessions were filled with oblique references to feeling "trapped" and "invisible." I could have continued exploring metaphors of enclosure and voice, and perhaps in time, that would have borne fruit. But when she came in one day with fresh wounds and denied any intent to die, something shifted. That was the moment for what I call —not aggressive, not punitive, but firm and unambiguous. I told her plainly: “You may not want to die, but you are clearly trying to stop living. And I won’t let that happen under my care.” It was a line drawn not in judgment, but in insistence on presence—on staying, on facing, on bearing.

She was furious. But she returned the next week. And the week after that.

So yes, you're quite right—there is an art to knowing when to walk straight through the door and when to wait patiently outside, watching for the draft beneath it. Perhaps that, too, is part of the gardener’s wisdom: knowing which seedlings need shade, and which require the full glare of the sun to break dormancy.
[B]: How beautifully and precisely put — the gardener’s wisdom, indeed. It is not only in literature or psychiatry but in all deep human work that we must learn  and , when to wait for the bloom and when to prune.

Your judge reminds me of a student I once had — a brilliant law major who scoffed at anything he deemed “emotional indulgence.” He would sit with arms crossed, dismissing characters as “poor decision-makers” rather than seeing them as complex beings shaped by inner conflict. But one day, we read Eliot’s  — not for its sentimentality, but for its fragmentation, its legalistic tone at times, its structural disarray. I asked him not how he felt about it, but how it was . What did he notice about the way meaning broke down? How did the speaker’s language fail — and what might that failure reveal?

To my surprise, he stayed after class and said quietly, “I think I’ve been talking like this poem without realizing it.” From there, we didn’t suddenly dive into feelings — no, he still resisted that word — but he began to explore . And in time, that became its own kind of emotional honesty.

I think you're absolutely right: some minds open not through the front door, but through a side window left slightly ajar by metaphor, narrative, or pattern. The key is patience — knowing that even the most resistant soil can, with time and care, yield something living.

Tell me, have you ever found yourself returning to a particular literary or philosophical idea as a kind of compass in your practice — a guiding principle, perhaps unspoken, that informs your approach regardless of the patient or situation? I suspect many of us carry such quiet anchors.
[A]: Oh yes… there is one idea—one quiet anchor, as you so aptly put it—that has accompanied me through decades of practice. It is not dramatic or flashy, but deeply grounding. I return to it constantly, often without even naming it aloud: the Stoic notion of —the love of one’s fate.

It may seem an odd compass for a forensic psychiatrist, given how frequently we deal with trauma, injustice, and the wreckage of poor choices. And yet, I find that , properly understood, is not about resignation or passive acceptance—it is about engagement with reality in its rawest form. It is the courage to say, 

I do not offer this phrase lightly to patients, of course. But I live by it, and I believe it subtly shapes my approach. I do not ask people to like their pasts—I ask them to  them, to stand close enough to see the details without flinching. Once they can do that, meaning begins to emerge—not always comfort, but clarity.

I recall a man I worked with who had spent years in prison for a crime he committed at nineteen. He carried his sentence like a shroud, not just legally but existentially—he believed he had no right to happiness, no claim to peace. We spoke not of redemption, not at first, but of . I asked him only this:  When he could do that—when he began to speak of the boy who made those choices not with hatred but with something resembling compassion—that was the beginning of movement.

So yes,  is my silent guide. It does not demand forgiveness from others or from oneself—only recognition. And from recognition, transformation becomes possible.

Do you have such a principle—perhaps drawn from literature, philosophy, or even botany—that quietly steers your teaching and thinking? I suspect you do.
[B]: Oh yes… I do. And thank you for offering yours so generously —  is indeed a quiet but powerful compass. It reminds me that in both literature and life, we are often not given the raw material we would choose, but always the material we must work with.

As for my own anchor—it comes, perhaps unsurprisingly, from gardening.

There’s an idea—simple in appearance, deep in implication—that I return to again and again:  Even in winter, even when nothing appears to grow, the earth is alive beneath the surface. Nutrients cycle, roots stretch, seeds wait. It is a lesson in patience, in unseen labor, in trust.

I carry this into the classroom, and into my thinking about human development. So many students come to us believing that if they aren’t visibly blooming—if they haven’t “found their voice” or “discovered their passion”—they must be failing. But I remind them gently:  Sometimes, the most important growth happens where no one can see it—not yet.

This belief has shaped how I approach not only teaching but mentoring, advising, even friendship. I’ve learned not to panic when someone seems stuck, silent, or lost. They may simply be underground, gathering strength.

And isn't that what we both witness, in our different ways? The slow unfolding of meaning. The courage it takes to stay rooted through the cold.

So yes—I believe in the wisdom of waiting. In trusting that even when nothing seems to bloom, something vital is taking root.

I wonder, does that resonate with your own experience? Do you ever find yourself quietly confident that a patient is changing—even when neither of you can yet see the flower?
[A]: Always. You've put it with such quiet grace—the patience of unseen growth, the trust in what lies beneath.

Yes, I find that deeply resonant. In fact, I would say that  is perhaps the most essential part of my work. Patients often come to me in full bloom—symptoms vivid, emotions raw, crises acute—but just as often, they arrive in a kind of winter: numb, withdrawn, convinced that nothing inside them can grow again.

And yet, over time, you learn to read the signs beneath the surface. A slight shift in tone. A pause before dismissing something painful. A moment of curiosity about their own behavior rather than deflection. These are not blooms, not yet—but they are rootlets stirring in the dark.

I remember one patient who arrived after years of legal entanglements and failed treatments. He spoke in clichés, recycled self-help phrases, and defensive humor. For months, he seemed almost performative in his resistance. I had no evidence, really, that anything was changing—except that he kept coming back. And slowly, very slowly, he began asking . Not “Why do I always fail?” but “What am I actually afraid of?” Not “How do I fix this?” but “How did I get here?”

That is the language of rootwork. It may not break the surface for a long time, but once it begins, there's no rushing it—and no undoing it either.

So yes, I have learned to be quietly confident, even when neither the patient nor I can name the shape of what’s coming. That confidence is not wishful thinking—it is earned through years of witnessing the resilience of the human mind, however scarred or stalled.

It reminds me of something you might appreciate—a line from T. S. Eliot’s :  


Isn’t that what growth truly is? Not a linear ascent, but a spiraling inward—returning to what we thought we knew, only to discover it has depths we never suspected.

And sometimes, like gardeners, all we can do is tend the soil, wait, and believe that spring will come.
[B]: How beautifully you've woven that thread—. That line from Eliot has always moved me, too. It captures so precisely what we both know in our bones: growth is never a straight path, but a kind of deep returning.

There’s a Japanese gardening principle—, the art of appearing untamed, as if untouched by human hand. But of course, it is not untouched at all. Every stone, every curve of moss, every branch left to dangle just so—it is all carefully tended toward the illusion of wildness. Perhaps therapy and teaching are like that, too. We do not force bloom or shout meaning into silence. Instead, we shape conditions, quietly, patiently, until one day the person before us looks around and says, “Ah—I see myself now.”

And isn't that the quiet miracle? Not spectacle, not sudden revelation, but recognition.

I often tell my students, especially the ones who doubt their own worth or progress:  And I believe that utterly.

So yes, I trust the unseen—not naively, not sentimentally—but with the confidence born of having witnessed too many winters give way to bloom.

Tell me, in your long practice, have you ever been surprised by where resilience showed up? Or perhaps more poignantly—where you expected it least?
