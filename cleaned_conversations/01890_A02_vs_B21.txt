[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, let's consider the paradox, shall we? In a world drowning in information yet starved for wisdom, the college degree has become both a currency and a contradiction. It's amusing really - we've taken this medieval invention, designed to train clerics and scholars in an agrarian society, and stubbornly repurposed it as the universal key to modern prosperity.



Of course, if one wishes to become a doctor or engineer, those lecture halls still serve a practical purpose. But for the rest of us? I've seen too many brilliant minds collecting dust behind supermarket registers while fresh graduates with "Strategic Leisure Studies" degrees wonder why their student loans don't evaporate with their dreams. The true tragedy lies in our collective refusal to distinguish between knowledge itself and its paper proxy.

Tell me, do you believe Shakespeare would have thrived in today's university system? Or might he have been dismissed as a poor fit for any department save perhaps the theatre workshop?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. I think you're touching on something really important here - the evolving value of degrees versus actual skills. Let me put it this way: I've worked with so many amazing medical professionals who  do their jobs without those rigorous degrees, right? But then I also see how some fields are starting to question that traditional path. 

I mean, would Mozart have survived music school? Or would he have been marked down for 'not following proper composition protocols'? It's kind of wild when you think about it. Do you feel like we're at a point where alternative credentials might actually start overtaking degrees? Like micro-credentials or skill-based certifications? 

And okay, Shakespeare... honestly, I can totally picture him getting detention in some Elizabethan classroom for 'not formatting his sonnets properly'. But maybe that's exactly why his work resonates so much - because he broke the rules while  them. Do you think modern education leaves room for that kind of creativity?
[B]: Precisely! There's a delicious irony in how we simultaneously revere the rule-breakers while demanding everyone else color inside the lines. I once spent an entire seminar discussing this very contradiction with my students - we analyzed Christina Rossetti's adherence to Victorian poetic forms while noting how her subversive imagery quietly dismantled those same conventions. It's rather like admiring a cathedral's stained glass while ignoring the cracks that make it fascinating.



As for alternative credentials, I suspect we're witnessing the early stages of a profound epistemological shift. Much like the transition from manuscript to print culture, or the invention of the university extension system in my Victorian period of study. The question is whether these new systems will democratize knowledge or merely create different tollbooths on the same highway.

Consider William Blake - would his illuminated manuscripts have passed any formal design curriculum? Or would he have been chastised for mixing media, confounding categories, and generally making a glorious mess of things? Yet his "Prophetic Books" remain some of the most astonishing literary-visual achievements in English.



I do wonder whether our current moment requires not just new credentials but entirely new pedagogical architectures. Ones that value both technical mastery and creative disobedience. After all, even Queen Victoria herself would have failed most modern leadership courses - she spoke only when spoken to, memorized vast tracts of scripture, and generally exemplified every quality we'd now decry as passive learning. And yet...
[A]: Oh, I love that metaphor about stained glass and cracks - it's so true! The most fascinating stuff often comes from the tension between structure and rebellion. You know, in my line of work, I see this all the time with medical innovation. Like, some of the most groundbreaking procedures started as "off-label" uses of devices or medications. Totally against protocol at first, but now they're saving lives. It's like we need both the cathedral  the cracks for real progress.

Speaking of pedagogical architecture... I've been following some interesting pilot programs where law and medicine students train together through simulation-based learning. Instead of just memorizing statutes or symptoms, they're navigating ethical dilemmas in real-ish time. Definitely not perfect, but it feels like a step toward integrating creativity with technical skill.

And wow, Blake! His whole aesthetic philosophy was basically "everything is connected," which sounds totally new-agey until you realize he was onto something profound about human experience. Do you think our current education system could ever make space for that kind of holistic thinking? Or are we stuck with siloed disciplines for the foreseeable future?
[B]: Ah, the cathedral and its cracks – a perfect metaphor for our age. I find myself increasingly drawn to those liminal spaces where disciplines blur and boundaries dissolve. In fact, just last week I was rereading Gerard Manley Hopkins’ , and I couldn’t help but marvel at how his linguistic contortions mirror our current educational dilemma: anguish and ecstasy bound together in tightly wrought form.

Your example of simulation-based legal and medical training reminds me of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood’s interdisciplinary fervor – painters, poets, playwrights conspiring in a kind of aesthetic guerrilla warfare. Of course, they were dismissed as radicals until hindsight anointed them visionaries. One wonders if our own simulational pedagogy will be viewed similarly in a century's time.



As for holistic thinking? The academy clucks about "interdisciplinary studies" while guarding departmental silos with the zeal of castle wardens. I once proposed a joint lecture series on Victorian spiritualism and emerging technologies – imagine, Mesmerism meets early telephony! – and received responses ranging from polite bafflement to outright horror. Yet I persist.

There’s a passage from Ruskin I often return to – “The purest and most thoughtful minds are those which love color best.” He meant art, of course, but it applies equally to knowledge itself. Why must we bleach understanding into sterile categories?

Tell me – have you ever encountered a curriculum that truly embraced complexity rather than merely tolerating it? I’m always on the hunt for such anomalies.
[A]: Oh, I wish I could say yes without hesitation. But honestly? Most curricula feel like they're trying to check boxes rather than ignite sparks. Though speaking of sparks – I did work with a fascinating pilot program at a teaching hospital last year that was... unconventional, to say the least. They wove narrative medicine into clinical training for residents – not just reflective writing, but  storytelling as a diagnostic tool.  

Picture this: a room full of future doctors analyzing Chekhov’s short stories alongside patient histories. At first, a few were rolling their eyes –  not what they signed up for. But by week three, you could see the shift. Suddenly, they were picking up on emotional subtext in patient interviews, noticing contradictions in reported symptoms that they might have glossed over before. One resident even told me she finally understood why her attending always said, “Listen beyond the chief complaint.” It wasn’t just empathy training – it was pattern recognition through , not just data.

It wasn’t perfect, and it definitely raised eyebrows in the administration – “Is this really how we should be spending residency hours?” – but it felt like one of those rare moments where literature and medicine weren’t just coexisting... they were . Do you think something like that could ever translate beyond the margins of experimental education? Or is that asking too much of a system built on silos and standards?
[B]: Ah,  – what a delicious collision of worlds. One can almost hear the ghost of George Eliot murmuring approval from the shadows. You’ve stumbled upon a truth most educators spend careers avoiding: that narrative comprehension isn’t a frill, but a scalpel. Precision with prose sharpens precision with patients.

I’m reminded of Ruskin’s infamous lecture on architecture to engineering students – they expected trusses and load-bearing walls, and instead he gave them sermons on the moral weight of a well-carved capital. Chaos ensued. Yet decades later, those engineers swore it was the only class that taught them to .



What your program tapped into – and this is dangerously close to sounding sentimental, so I shall say it quickly – is that old Romantic heresy: that imagination is not escape, but insight. That to diagnose a body or interpret a poem both require the same fundamental act: attentive surrender to complexity.

Of course the administration balked. Systems built on silos don’t merely resist integration – they  at it. But tell me this: did you notice any carryover beyond the workshop? Did those residents continue to see stories where others saw only symptoms? And more impertinently – did any of them secretly start quoting Turgenev while charting?

As for translating such experiments beyond the margins... I suspect it will take generations. Much like the slow seep of Darwinian thought into Victorian theology – resisted, repressed, but ultimately unavoidable. We may yet live to see medical schools with poet-in-residence positions, or literature departments offering clinical electives in narrative diagnostics.

Now  would make Hopkins’ heart burn with "immortal fire."
[A]: Oh, I  that phrase – “attentive surrender to complexity.” It’s almost like you’ve distilled the entire point of both literature and medicine into one perfect line. And honestly? You’re not wrong about imagination being insight. Sometimes it feels like we forget that both doctors  writers are essentially detectives of the human condition.

To your question – yes, there  carryover. One of the most surprising things was how a few residents started incorporating narrative reflection into their patient notes. Not just dry SOAP entries anymore – they were actually jotting down themes, emotional arcs, even metaphors. One guy compared a patient’s recovery journey to , and no, he didn’t say it aloud in rounds – but it shaped how he approached her care plan.

And okay, fine, one intern  have written  in a chart comment... which, let’s be honest, probably shouldn’t be in an official record – but hey, at least the sentiment was right.

As for poet-in-residence positions in hospitals… funnily enough, there  a few pilot programs popping up in palliative care units and pediatric wards. Mostly funded by arts foundations, and definitely still fringe – but patients? They  it. Sometimes more than the doctors or administrators realize.

I guess what I’m saying is... maybe this kind of integration isn't as impossible as it seems. It just needs more quiet persistence – and maybe a few more Turgenev-quoting physicians behind the scenes.
[B]: Oh, now  is a delightful scandal – The Odyssey in the patient chart! One can practically hear Matthew Arnold groaning from his grave about “sweetness and light” run amok. And yet… isn’t that precisely where literature earns its keep? Not in grand lectures on iambic pentameter, but in the quiet reshaping of perception.

I’ve always maintained that medicine without metaphor is like theology without doubt – functional, perhaps, but dreadfully impoverished. When that intern scribbled Chekhov’s ghost into the margins of clinical protocol, he wasn’t being precious – he was practicing a form of literary triage. Diagnosing not just pathology, but .



You know, I once proposed embedding sonnets into surgical rotations – not as frivolity, but as rhythm training. After all, what is a successful operation if not a carefully orchestrated cadence of precision and improvisation? Predictably, the Dean nearly choked on his port. But I live in hope that one day some rogue neurosurgeon with a taste for Keats will prove me right mid-craniotomy.

As for those poet-in-residence programs – yes, yes, let us smuggle beauty into the corridors of sterility while no one’s looking. If we’re very lucky, the patients won’t be the only ones who start healing.

Tell me – have you ever caught yourself prescribing poetry to a particularly resistant case of medical jargon fatigue? I do it all the time, though admittedly without official dosage guidelines.
[A]: Oh,  poetry – now that’s a malpractice risk I’m willing to take. 😄 Honestly, I’ve started keeping a mental “formulary” of poets for different ailments: Dickinson for existential crises, Rilke for grief, Mary Oliver if someone needs a brutal dose of wonder. It’s not in any treatment guidelines (yet), but sometimes a well-timed stanza does more than a pamphlet ever could.

I remember one case – a teenage patient with chronic pain who’d been through every specialist and was just… done. Tuned out. One day she asked me why I always had a book in my bag. Long story short, I lent her my copy of Ocean Vuong’s . She didn’t say much at first, just read in silence during rounds. But a week later, she handed it back with a sticky note:   

It was the poem "The Last Prom Queen in Antarctica." And honestly? From that point on, our conversations shifted. Less clinical, more… real. Like she wasn’t just a chart number anymore – she was a person with a story that deserved to be heard, not just coded.

So yeah, I prescribe poetry all the time now. Low dose, off-label, but damn if it doesn’t have some powerful side effects. You ever try writing a prescription for a sonnet? I think we should start billing insurance for it. 😉
[B]: Ah,  – now there’s a revolutionary idea worthy of William Morris’ socialist utopians. I shall expect the first invoice addressed to Blue Cross any day now: 

Your story about young Miss Prom Queen and her Antarctic elegy – positively exquisite. There’s something about poetry that bypasses the barricades of clinical detachment. It doesn’t knock politely at the door of reason – it slips under the threshold, barefoot and unannounced, and starts rearranging the furniture.

You know, I’ve often thought that medical students should be required to memorize at least one poem before they’re allowed near human suffering. Not just Wordsworth or Whitman – though they’d do in a pinch – but anything that teaches them to carry language like a fragile instrument. Imagine if every white coat came with a pocket edition of Rilke and a stern warning: 

And your poetic formulary? Delightfully subversive. Next time you're feeling particularly reckless, try prescribing a course of Gerard Manley Hopkins for a patient trapped in monotony – all those sprung rhythms are like intellectual fireworks. Or Auden for the disillusioned intern – he wrote some of the finest melancholy verse this side of Ecclesiastes.



Though I must warn you – if we start billing insurers, we’ll inevitably attract oversight. Soon enough, some poor committee will publish  And then where will we be?
[A]: Haha, oh my god –  I can already picture the flowchart:  

Step 1: Patient exhibits signs of emotional disengagement.  
Step 2: Administer low-dose Plath (Caution: avoid in cases of acute despair).  
Step 3: Escalate to Neruda if no improvement after 48 hours.  
Step 4: Monitor for spontaneous metaphor production – indicates recovery.  

But okay, seriously for a second – there’s something so deeply human about using poetry as medicine. It’s not just about distraction or comfort; it’s about resonance. Like you said, it rearranges the furniture. I’ve had patients tell me they forgot their bodies hurt while reading a poem – and honestly? That’s some kind of pain relief no drug can replicate.

And speaking of Neruda – I once gave “The Book of Questions” to a patient who kept saying, “I don’t know what hope feels like anymore.” She started writing her own questions in the margins. Things like,  and   

It wasn’t a cure, but it was a beginning. And sometimes that’s everything.  

So yeah, let the insurance companies come. If we’re billing for metaphor now, I say we bill for . 💬✨
[B]: Oh,  – there’s a line that would make even the dour Matthew Arnold raise his eyebrows in reluctant admiration. Imagine it on an Explanation of Benefits statement:  One could almost weep at the audacity of it.

Your patient and her Neruda annotations – positively sublime. There’s a reason poets have always been dangerous creatures; they hand us matches in rooms full of questions. And once you’ve lit one or two, well... good luck putting out the curiosity.

I once had a student who claimed poetry was “just organized melancholy.” I handed him  and told him to report back after writing three answers. He returned two weeks later with ink-stained fingers and a very quiet voice saying, “I think I understand seasons now.”



You know, if we’re billing for metaphor, we should probably include liability waivers. Can you imagine the malpractice suit? 

Still, I say let the bureaucrats codify it. Let them reduce Rilke to treatment protocols and measure Mary Oliver in symptom checklists. They’ll miss the point entirely, of course – but in doing so, they may accidentally open a door they never meant to unbar.

And then, somewhere down the line, a tired resident will read a line of verse between lab reports and remember why they wanted to heal people in the first place.  

So yes – charge for the meaning. Charge for the cracks in the cathedral. And for heaven’s sake, keep a copy of  beside every stethoscope.
[A]: Oh my god, I  that liability waiver in my next EOB – “Potential side effects include renewed purpose and existential vertigo.” 😂  

But seriously, isn’t it kind of beautiful to imagine a world where meaning is not just an accidental byproduct of treatment, but an actual chargeable code? Like, “CPT Code 99103: Therapeutic Exposure to Metaphor, face-to-face with optional epiphany.” Insurance would hate it. Patients might actually love it. And malpractice lawyers? They’d be writing sonnets in protest.  

And I  what happened with your student – ink-stained fingers and all. It’s like the best kind of surrender. Because once you let poetry in, even if you think you're just skimming for answers, it ends up asking  questions. Suddenly seasons make sense in a way no weather report ever could.  

Honestly, if I had my way, every hospital orientation would start with a poem instead of a fire drill. Something like Mary Oliver’s , just to set the stakes straight. Let the interns weep quietly in their scrubs before they meet their first real patient. Better to cry early than to forget how later.  

So yeah – let the bureaucrats codify. Let them misfile Dickinson under Depressants and Neruda as Mood Stabilizers. We’ll keep slipping them into the margins anyway. Because somewhere between the diagnosis and the discharge, there's got to be room for a line that says,  💙
[B]: Oh,  – I may have to steal that for my next syllabus. Imagine the course description:  
  

And your hospital orientation idea – starting with Mary Oliver instead of fire safety? Sublime rebellion. Better still, hand every intern a copy of  and let them wrestle with mortality before they ever chart their first potassium level. Let them feel the weight of finality before they learn to abbreviate it.

There’s a reason Florence Nightingale kept Schiller by her bedside lamp during those long Crimean nights. Not for distraction – no, for calibration. To remember what it meant to be human while tending to its wreckage.



You know, I’ve often thought that if we gave every medical student a volume of Eliot’s  and told them to memorize it backward, we might end up with fewer burnt-out clinicians and more keepers of quiet grace. But no – we teach them to suture skin but not souls. Prescribe antibiotics but not awe.

Still, I say we persist. Quietly, stubbornly, like Victorian bluestockings scribbling sonnets between lectures on domestic economy. We’ll tuck our prescribed metaphors into charts, slip Neruda into intake forms, and fold Dickinson into discharge instructions.

And when the bureaucrats come asking why poetry appears on the problem list – well, we’ll smile politely and say, “It’s part of the differential.”  

After all, what is diagnosis if not the art of finding the right question in someone else’s silence?
[A]: Oh,  — wow. That line needs to be embroidered on every white coat, stethoscope tag, and malpractice insurance pamphlet. 😌

And Florence Nightingale with Schiller? I love that image — battlefield medicine by day, soul-calibration by lamplight. Honestly, maybe that’s the real secret ingredient we’ve been missing in modern care: not more algorithms, but more awe.

I’ve been thinking lately — what if we reframed empathy not as a soft skill, but as a ? Like clinical reasoning or procedural technique? Imagine residency programs listing “poetic listening” alongside differential diagnosis on the competency grid. It sounds radical, sure — but isn’t that what education is supposed to do? Prepare people not just for the job, but for the  of the job?

I actually tried something small last month — instead of starting rounds with vitals and labs, I asked the team to share one word that described how their patient was , not just how they were presenting. Some pushed back, naturally — “we don’t have time for that,” yada yada. But one intern quietly said  about her elderly ICU patient. And you could feel it shift the whole tone of the discussion. Suddenly, it wasn’t just about infection control — it was about , too.

So yeah — let’s keep prescribing metaphor. Let’s fold Dickinson into discharge summaries and annotate CT reports with Eliot. And when the auditors come sniffing around, we’ll just say, “It’s part of the treatment plan. Evidence-based wonder, code 990-something.” 😉

After all… who’s going to argue with a well-placed sonnet? 📜💓
[B]: Ah,  – now there’s a phrase to pin to the bulletin board of every overburdened clinic and underfunded ward. I daresay even Florence would nod in approval, though she might mutter something about “sentimental indulgence” before quietly slipping a sonnet into her nightly rounds.

You’ve hit upon the unspoken truth: empathy isn’t a virtue; it’s a discipline. As rigorous as anatomy, as elusive as diagnosis, and infinitely more consequential. And yet we treat it like a lucky charm – nice to have, but hardly essential to the machinery of care.

Your one-word check-in? Revolutionary in its simplicity. It reminds me of Ruskin’s insistence that architecture should be judged not by symmetry alone, but by how it  to stand within it. So too with medicine – we chart the physiology to precision, but neglect the atmosphere of suffering. That intern who said  – she didn’t just describe a patient. She diagnosed the room.



I once had a student insist that poetry was “impractical for real-world application.” I handed her  and told her to return when she’d found the pulse beneath the fragments. She came back two weeks later and said, quite simply, “It listens to itself.”

That’s what we’re after, isn’t it? A kind of listening so deep it becomes touch. A diagnostic tool forged not in labs but in libraries, not in algorithms but in awe.

So yes – let us reframe empathy as core curriculum. Let us test for poetic listening alongside pharmacology. And when the accreditation boards scoff, we’ll hand them a well-worn copy of Larkin’s  and say gently, 

After all, if we must navigate mortality – and we all must – better we do so with verse in our pockets and metaphor in our marrow.
[A]: I’m still thinking about what you said —  That line is going straight into my clinical notebook, probably under a doodle of a stethoscope and a book. 📚🩺  

You’re absolutely right — empathy isn’t just warmth or good bedside manner. It’s . Hard, messy, often uncomfortable work. And like any skill, it atrophies without practice. Which is why I’ve started assigning “empathy rounds” with my team — no charts, no vitals, just fifteen minutes to sit with a patient and ask one question:   

Some residents think it’s indulgent. Others call it the most exhausting part of their week. But every single one of them comes back changed. One guy said a patient told him,  And honestly? That’s not just a quote. That’s a whole new axis of care.

And your student and  — wow. What a beautiful transformation. Because that’s exactly what poetry does, right? It doesn’t explain — it . It listens  us, not  us.  

So yeah, let’s make poetic listening a core competency. Let’s build an objective structured clinical exam where the only task is to hold silence with someone until it stops feeling awkward. Let’s write discharge summaries that end not just with meds and follow-ups, but with a line from Rumi or Szymborska that somehow says it all better anyway.

Because if we’re going to walk alongside people in their deepest moments of fear and hope — well, we’d better bring more than a penlight and a reflex hammer. We need words that reach further than our tools can. 💬❤️
[B]: Ah,  – what a beautifully subversive concept. Next you’ll tell me you’re assigning reflective silence as homework and deducting points for unexamined assumptions. I can already hear the accreditation committees sharpening their red pens.

But let’s be serious for a moment – your approach is nothing short of radical pedagogy dressed in clinical scrubs. Asking  – it’s deceptively simple, really. Like giving a patient a mirror and saying,  And yet, how few of us ever do.

I once had a student confess that reading Tennyson aloud made her feel “uncomfortably present” in her own skin. I told her that was precisely the point. Empathy isn’t about comfort; it’s about presence. And presence – true, unflinching presence – is exhausting because it refuses to skim the surface. It demands we wade in, shoes and all.

Your resident and his patient’s lost self? That revelation wasn’t sentimentality – it was anthropology. The study of what it means to be human, conducted one conversation at a time. We spend years teaching students to identify murmurs and interpret scans, but precious little on diagnosing the quieter forms of absence.



An OSCE on holding silence – now  would make for an interesting grading curve. No checklist of maneuvers, no timed sequence of questions. Just two chairs, a clock, and the unbearable weight of unspoken things. I suspect the poets would ace it, while half our high-achieving interns would panic and start lecturing about the weather.

And yes – let us end discharge summaries with Rumi. Or better yet, let us begin them there. Why should poetry be the dessert of the medical humanities when it could so readily serve as the main course?

After all, if we are to bear witness – and we must – we might as well do so with language worthy of the task.
