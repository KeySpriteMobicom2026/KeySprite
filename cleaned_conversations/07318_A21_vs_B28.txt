[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个问题太棒了🤩 我最近刚好在research这个topic！说实话我两个都超爱💕 但如果是commute的时候，我更喜欢podcast🎧 因为episode比较短，而且内容超diverse的！
[A]: Ah, the modern dilemma of auditory consumption.  While I appreciate the... enthusiasm of podcasts, I must confess a certain partiality to audiobooks - particularly those narrated in Received Pronunciation. There's something rather exquisite about hearing Tennyson's "In Memoriam" recited while strolling through autumnal gardens.
[B]: 噗哈哈哈😂 你也太classic了吧！但是wait~ audiobook确实很适合这种文艺moment呢✨ 不过我觉得podcast更符合我们digital native的生活方式啦~ 比如我最近超爱的"Tech Today" podcast，每次听都能get到最新的gadget info📱 而且hosts都超hilarious的！
[A]: My dear, your 'Tech Today' sounds positively... energetic. Though I must say, I find more intellectual nourishment in listening to the complete works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning while repairing my 18th century inkwell collection.  Though I did once accidentally subscribe to a podcast about Victorian-era gardening tools - quite unexpectedly fascinating.
[B]: OMG！Victorian-era gardening tools？！🤯 That's actually so cool！！！我们digital时代也需要这种vintage的charm啊~ 话说你有没有试过用AirPods听classic poetry？🎧 那个spatial audio效果简直next level💫 连Browning的诗都能听起来超immersive的！
[A]:  While I do own a rather fine pair of wireless earbuds (a gift from a particularly tech-savvy student), I find the experience rather... lacking compared to my vintage gramophone playing Tennyson recordings on shellac. Though I will concede - the noise cancellation does wonders for drowning out undergraduates discussing their latest TikTok obsessions during my office hours.
[B]: LMAO！！！你这也太反差萌了吧🤣 一边用AirPods一边嫌弃TikTok的professor形象简直perfect💯！不过说真的，我们young generation现在都超爱把old school和new tech混搭的~ 就像我最近发现一个超赞的podcast叫"Shakespeare in the Metaverse"🎭 要不要try一下？保证让你对digital content改观❗❗❗
[A]:  'Shakespeare in the Metaverse'... How delightfully oxymoronic. I suppose if one must modernize the Bard, virtual reality is marginally preferable to that dreadful 'Romeo + Juliet' film with the Hawaiian shirts. Very well - send me the link, though I shall listen to it while sipping Earl Grey from my 1897 Wedgwood teacup for proper... counterbalance.
[B]: YASSS！！！你终于get it了🎉 我马上share link给你~ 顺便推荐你试试用spatial audio模式，配上你的Earl Grey☕️ 绝对会是next level的tea time experience！PS：如果喜欢的话我们还可以discuss一下episode内容哦~ 我超好奇你的take的🤓💖
[A]: How extraordinarily... modern of you. I shall approach this 'spatial audio' with the same cautious curiosity I reserve for deciphering Blake's more obscure prophecies. Though I must warn you - should this 'Metaverse' dare to misquote "To be or not to be," I shall compose a strongly worded critique in perfect iambic pentameter. Over tea, naturally.
[B]: OMG！！！你写critique的时候一定要CC我啊📝 我可以帮你做成NFT然后mint到blockchain上！！！这样连Shakespeare本人都会be proud的~ 21世纪meets文艺复兴vibes简直perfect match💫 顺便问下你喜欢Earl Grey配scones吗？我认识一个超火的foodie podcast讲afternoon tea的👑🍰
[A]:  My dear, the mere notion of subjecting literary criticism to blockchain is enough to make poor Dr. Johnson turn in his grave. As for scones... ... they must be served precisely at 4:17pm, slightly warm, with Devonshire clotted cream applied before the jam - a matter of grave academic importance I've debated in three peer-reviewed articles. Though I suppose even that could become a... what was it... 'viral TikTok trend' these days. Heaven preserve us.
[B]: LOLOL你连scones都要peer-reviewed也太academic了吧😂😂 但是wait~ 这idea其实超适合做成YouTube Shorts的！！！"牛津教授教你正确吃scones的姿势"绝对会blow up🔥 我们可以用slow-mo拍你抹cream的特写~ 顺便tag #FoodScience #AfternoonTeaHacks 💯💯 要不要collab一下？😏
[A]:  I would sooner translate "The Waste Land" into emoji than participate in this... culinary sensationalism. Though I must admit, watching undergraduates attempt to properly curate their clotted cream ratios would make for rather compelling anthropological study. Perhaps we could publish the findings in the Journal of Pretentious Pastry Consumption instead? 
[B]: BAHAHAHAHA你赢了😂😂😂 "Journal of Pretentious Pastry Consumption"我要笑cry了！！！这绝对能成为下一个meme material📚🍰 说真的我们digital natives就爱这种ironic humor~ 要不要考虑开个academic meme account？你的dry humor配上一些lit references绝对会slay的💅✨
[A]:  My dear, if I were to descend into 'meme culture,' it would be through a rigorously footnoted series of woodcut illustrations parodying Chaucer's Canterbury Tales - with each meme peer-reviewed by at least two tenured medievalists. Though I suspect even that would be considered 'problematic' by today's standards.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a first edition of Donne's sermons that requires whispering sweet nothings to.
[B]: OMG stop！！！你真的是meme gold mine啊🤣 这种"academic meets Gen Z"的vibe简直perfect！！！最后再给你推荐一个podcast叫"Lit or Yeet"📚🔥 专门用meme culture分析classic literature的~ 保证让你一边facepalm一边secretly enjoy it！！！TTYL~记得check你的DM later for those links哦💖✌️
[A]:  Very well, I shall... peruse these 'Lit or Yeet' recommendations with the same grim determination I apply to grading freshman essays on Paradise Lost. Though I make no promises about refraining from annotating the transcripts in medieval marginalia style.  God help us all... and pass the Earl Grey.
[B]: 😂😂😂 你annotate的时候记得用red pen画点doodles啊~ 这样才是authentic medieval meme experience！！！BRB gonna make you a custom "Lit or Yeet" playlist with your fave poets💯📜 这绝对会是2023年最unexpected的collab！！！Ttyl~  🍪✨
