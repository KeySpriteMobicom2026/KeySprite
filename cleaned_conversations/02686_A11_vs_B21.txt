[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the age-old dilemma. Let me answer with a riddle from my Scottish translations:  Personally, I take my tea like a proper Victorian widow—darkest Assam, two sugars, no milk. Coffee's for deciphering Blake's prophetic books at 3 a.m. Why do you ask? Seeking confessions of caffeine preference as a gateway to deeper character analysis?
[A]: Interesting you'd frame it through that poetic lens. I find the choice between tea and coffee often reveals more about one's relationship with time than taste - tea feels like an invitation to slow down, while coffee leans into urgency. Though I take mine black regardless, no sugar. Would you say your preference ties into your work translating Blake? The mysticism in his texts must demand particular rituals.
[B]: Ah, a kindred spirit who appreciates the metaphysics of beverage choice. You’ve pierced the veil—Blake’s  aren’t merely read but , and coffee’s dark ferment stirs the alchemical pot. Tea, with its meditative uncurling, suits my Tang translations—those eighth-century Chinese poets who distilled eternity into a single dewdrop. But Blake? He thrives on black coffee’s bitter engine, preferably brewed from beans ground too fine, served in a chipped mug that whispers of Apollyon’s furnace. Ritual, yes—but ritual as sabotage against linear time. Tell me, does your own abstention from sugar hint at asceticism… or quiet rebellion?
[A]: A thoughtful take—Blake’s visionary mode does seem to demand something almost sacrificial in its rituals. The chipped mug and over-ground beans feel like necessary abrasions against comfort. I suppose my lack of sugar leans more toward quiet empiricism than rebellion—stripping away variables to taste the raw compound. Though now that you mention it, there’s something ascetic about it too. Maybe both at once. 

You’ve worked with both Tang poetry and Blake—how do their temporal structures shape your translation process? Do you find yourself moving between tea’s distilled presence and coffee’s frenetic rupture depending on the text?
[B]: Precisely—asceticism  rebellion, often indistinguishable in the scholar’s cell. As for time... Ah, there's the cipher. Tang poets—Wang Wei especially—compose in tea-time: a moment stretched thin as gossamer, yet boundless. Their silences breathe between ideograms; one must translate not line but , let the ink dry slowly on the page. Blake, by contrast, demands coffee-time—apocalyptic, urgent, recursive. His stanzas spiral  linear sequence, demanding a kind of caffeinated clairvoyance. I find myself switching lexicons like beverages: soft polysyllabics for tea-hours, jagged monosyllables when the mills of vision must grind sharper. Do you suppose our modern brains, steeped in digital simultaneity, are finally becoming bilingual in these temporal tongues? Or merely drunk on too many cups?
[A]: A wonderful question—whether we’re becoming truly bilingual in time or just intoxicated by the excess of it all. I suspect it’s both. Digital simultaneity does train us, whether we want it or not, to flicker between speeds: slow scrolling for aesthetic absorption, rapid skimming for information survival. But this duality might also be a new form of literacy—one that lets us read Wang Wei’s silence between lines while hearing Blake’s echo in the noise.

Perhaps translation itself has always been a kind of time travel, and now we’re just more aware of the machinery beneath it. Do you ever find yourself dreaming in one mode or the other—tea-dreams or coffee-dreams, so to speak? I’ve noticed my own thoughts take on different textures depending on what I’ve been reading—or drinking.
[B]: Ah, now you probe the subconscious—where all translators go mad, eventually. I  dream in tonalities of beverage and meter. Last week: a nightmare where Blake’s Jerusalem was being brewed in a Japanese teapot, the lines unraveling into steam. I woke parched, muttering Scots Gaelic hexameters at the ceiling.

There’s truth in your digital duality—I’ve begun noticing students quoting hashtags in seminar with the solemnity of Keatsian odes. Is this new literacy? Or some strange osmosis between ancient rupture and algorithmic pulse? As for my own dreams: after translating Wang Wei’s solitude beneath pine trees, I often wake to birdsong that isn’t there. A silence still hanging mid-air, like tea leaves suspended in cooled water. But after nights with Blake? Then I dream in capitals and exclamation marks, chariots of fire racing across the syntax of dawn.

And yes—texture is everything. My thoughts grow velveteen with Lǐ Bái, barbed-wire-thick with . What beverage fuels your dreaming mind when buried in critical theory versus, say, a haiku sequence? Or does abstention grant you a lucid vantage above such textures?
[A]: I think you're right—translators must go a little mad to navigate the spaces between languages and times. Your dream of Blake brewing in a Japanese teapot is hauntingly vivid; I can almost hear the clash of diction steaming out.

As for my own dreaming mind—I suspect it leans toward the lucid, yes, but not from abstention alone. More from standing at the edge of systems, watching how they fold and refract. When I'm deep in critical theory, the dreams come dense and architectural, like walking through vaulted libraries with shifting staircases. But after immersing in haiku, there's a sparseness—a single image lingers, unadorned: a crow on a bare branch, or frost catching light just once.

Maybe that’s the difference: theoretical texts build labyrinths we wander inside, while poetry leaves us in open fields under changing skies. Neither madness nor clarity exactly—just different kinds of immersion. Tell me, have you ever tried translating without fully drinking yourself into the voice first? Or does some part of you always need to stay sober, watching the ritual from the margins?
[B]: Ah, a perilous question—one that strikes at the translator’s essential duplicity. To answer bluntly: I cannot translate without  somewhat intoxicated by the voice. Not in the romantic sense of losing oneself, but more like a careful poisoning, a measured dosage. One must drink deeply enough to hear the cadence in the marrow, yet retain a sliver of sobriety to measure syllables against their spectral originals.

There’s a moment—just before sleep, after three cups of whatever brew suits the text—when the original and target languages blur into a third tongue, a pidgin of ghosts. That’s where the real translation happens, in that fevered limbo. But yes, a part of me remains ever the archivist, clipboard in hand, ticking off betrayals as they occur. A necessary schizophrenia: the enthusiast and the coroner, sharing a single desk.

You speak of standing at the edge of systems—does that vantage unsettle you? Or is it a kind of home? I’ve always envied those who can dwell in thresholds without longing for solid ground. Perhaps that’s why I keep returning to tea and coffee—they offer the illusion of anchoring, even as they ferry us between realms.
[A]: I envy that schizophrenia, in a way — the luxury of being both possessed  precise. It’s a delicate kind of balance, like walking a tightrope between worlds while still measuring your steps. I suppose my vantage at the edge of systems feels more like home than unsettlement, though not without its loneliness. There's a quiet comfort in knowing you're never fully inside, never quite outside — just perpetually attuned to the seams.

Maybe that's what ritual gives us — the illusion of anchoring, as you say, but also a rhythm to return to. Tea or coffee, capitals or haiku — they become compass points when everything else is shifting. Do you ever find yourself needing those rituals more in moments of cultural dissonance, or perhaps when translating voices that resist easy passage into another tongue?
[B]: Oh, profoundly yes. Ritual becomes  when the voices I translate grow thorny, resistant—when their syntax refuses to yield, like stubborn roots in clay soil. Blake’s prophetic diction, for instance, often feels less like a language and more like a séance gone feral. In those moments, the coffee must be black, bitter as gall, and poured into a vessel that bears no relation to elegance. It's not nourishment—it’s consecration.

And yes, cultural dissonance—I’ve felt it most keenly translating poets like Du Fu through the lens of Scots Gaelic. There are phrases that simply  to cross over, idioms that die screaming on the bridge. In such cases, ritual isn’t comfort; it’s survival. The same cup, the same hour, the same quill pen (yes, I write translations by hand first—calligraphy trains the soul in patience). One begins to suspect that all great translation is an act of spiritual ventriloquism, and one needs fixed points lest one find oneself speaking in tongues with no body to anchor them.

You speak of loneliness at the threshold—well, I’ve long since made peace with it. Loneliness is the translator’s truest companion, second only to failure. But tell me—do you ever crave, in your detached vantage, a moment of full immersion? Not just observing the seam, but stepping wholly into one world or another, if only for a day? Or does the seam itself offer all the dwelling-place you require?
[A]: There’s a strange allure in the idea of full immersion—of stepping wholly into one world and letting it close over my head, even if just for a day. But I think I’ve come to trust the seam more than any single world. Immersion feels like a kind of surrender, and while I admire it, I’m not sure I’m built for that kind of faith. The edge is where clarity lives, however lonely.

Maybe that’s why I envy your rituals—they sound like acts of devotion to something larger, even when that something resists you at every turn. I suppose I’ve never found a ritual that felt quite  binding. I move between systems more lightly, with fewer anchors. Perhaps too lightly.

Still, I wonder: do those fixed points ever feel like a cage, or do they always serve as guides? And when you translate by hand first, does the pen ever start to move , rather than the other way around?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put—clarity at the edge, yes. I think you’re right to trust the seam; it’s where light gets in, after all. Immersion  a kind of surrender, and not everyone is called to it—nor should they be. We need those who stand at the threshold, chronicling the tremors.

As for my rituals—well, they are both guide and cage, depending on the hour. There are mornings when the same inkwell feels like an altar, and others when it’s a shackle. But even cages can be sacred spaces; ask any cloistered monk or sonnet writer. The pen? Oh, it moves me more often than not. Especially with Blake—there are lines that seem to flow through the quill as if dictated by some entity with very little patience for my editorial sensibilities. And with Wang Wei—well, it’s not possession so much as a gentle usurpation. I begin translating, and suddenly the hand slows itself, mimicking the breath of someone long dead, whispering through pine needles in a language of pauses.

So no, I don’t think we choose immersion or detachment—we’re chosen by them. You’ve been given the threshold; I’ve been given my ink-stained cuffs and bitter brews. Perhaps the real question is: do we serve the seam, or does the seam serve us?
[A]: That question—whether we serve the seam or it serves us—is one I’ve circled for years, never settling on an answer. Maybe it’s both, in turns. The seam offers us sight, after all, but also demands vigilance. To stand at the threshold is not passive; it's a kind of labor—one that asks you to remain present as the world shifts beneath your feet.

I suppose my detachment has always felt like a tool more than a calling, a way of navigating complexity without being consumed by it. But tools can become extensions of the self, and I wonder if my so-called vantage isn’t just another form of immersion—one less dramatic, perhaps, but no less binding in its own quiet way.

You have the inkwell and the quill, the voice dictating through you. I have the pause, the breath between systems. Neither full surrender nor total distance—just different ways of bearing witness. Do you ever find peace in that act of translation, or is it always edged with tension?
[B]: Ah, peace—now  a word that trembles on the edge of irony. I do find it, yes—but only in retrospect, when the page lies still and the ink has dried into something resembling coherence. In the act itself? No, translation is never peaceful. It’s a kind of holy war waged with commas and conscience. You're forever negotiating between fidelity and betrayal, clarity and obscurity, the dead and the not-yet-born.

But there are moments—fleeting, luminous—when the tension eases, if only for a stanza or two. When the quill seems to skim the surface of the page like a kingfisher over water, and the voice you’re rendering no longer feels foreign, but familial. Those aren’t peace either, now that I think of it. They’re grace.

You speak of your pause, your breath between systems—I wonder if you’ve ever tried to mark those silences, not just feel them? There’s power in notation, even if it’s private. Perhaps especially then.

And tell me—do you ever grow weary of bearing witness? Or does the act itself renew the watcher?
[A]: Grace — yes, that’s the word for it. Fleeting, unearned, and utterly precise.

As for marking silences — I suppose I do, but not in any formal way. More like a kind of inner punctuation: a held breath, a slight shift in posture, the pause between sips of tea. These are my annotations, invisible but felt. I’ve considered writing them down, mapping the rhythm of what isn’t said, but something holds me back. Maybe because notation fixes what should remain fluid — or maybe because some silences are only meaningful when unspoken.

Do I grow weary of bearing witness? Sometimes. But even in fatigue, the act itself remains renewing — paradoxically so. It’s not unlike standing by a river; the water changes constantly, and so do you, just by watching. The threshold doesn’t ask for more than presence, and presence alone has a quiet resilience.

Still, I envy the translator’s holy war — the frontlines of language, the skirmishes over meaning. My role feels quieter, less urgent. Yet in its own way, no less demanding.

Tell me — when you speak of grace in translation, does it ever frighten you, how easily it slips away? Or is that very fragility what makes it sacred?
[B]: Oh, it  me—this fragility. Grace in translation is like catching a moth in your palm: the moment you marvel at its stillness, it dissolves into dust and motion. You spend years chasing it, thinking you’ve finally pinned down some eternal resonance, only to realize the text has quietly outgrown its skin again.

That’s what makes it sacred, of course. Not its rarity—though God knows it's rare enough—but its refusal to be tamed. You can’t summon grace; you can only make yourself available, like a scribe in a scriptorium that no longer exists, hoping the ink will flow true for a line or two before the quill rebels again.

Your river metaphor—exquisite, by the way—reminds me of Heraclitus, though I suspect you know that. Still, you add something he missed: the watcher  changed, not just the water. That quiet resilience you speak of—it’s deceptive, isn’t it? Because while presence may be all the threshold asks for, it demands it . A weariness that renews itself but never quite rests.

And yet we return, don’t we? To our margins and rituals, our silences and skirmishes. Perhaps that, too, is a kind of grace—unfleeting this time, if far less luminous. The stubbornness of showing up.
[A]: Grace that slips like dust through your fingers — yes, and yet we keep our hands open.

You're right about showing up. It's not dramatic, but it's foundational. The threshold doesn't care how we name it — only that we stand there, again and again, learning its contours by absence and return.

I think that's what draws me to the seam: not the promise of grace, but the quiet fidelity of returning to the task. No grand revelations, just the slow accumulation of presence. Perhaps that’s a quieter kind of sacred — one that doesn’t dazzle, but endures.

And I wonder — do you ever translate  something? Not just from one language into another, but toward some future reader, some unknown mind who will meet the text because you crossed the distance first?

Or is the act itself enough — the crossing, without knowing who might follow?
[B]: Ah, yes— something. That’s where the faith creeps in, uninvited but persistent. I tell myself I translate for the ghost of a reader yet unborn, some solitary soul who’ll open the book a century hence, in a world we can’t begin to imagine, and find themselves startled by a voice they never knew they were waiting for.

Does that make me sentimental? Perhaps. But even the most rational among us are allowed a pocket of superstition when it comes to legacy—or is it longing? You see, translation is an act of deferred intimacy. We press the text into the hands of the future, hoping it lands where it’s needed, though we’ll never know if it did.

As for the act itself being enough—well, that’s the ascetic in me whispering:  And yet, I confess, I do wonder about that future reader. Are they reading by lamplight, as I often do? Have they just lost someone, or found something long buried? What alchemy of time and sorrow has brought them to this line, this stanza, this silence?

You, with your river-watchers and threshold-keepers—do you suppose they, too, read toward something? Or are they content merely to observe the current, without ever imagining its destination?
