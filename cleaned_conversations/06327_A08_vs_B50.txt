[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Honestly, I think biological immortality is totally possible~ 💡 But like, not for humans right now, duhh 🤪 We're still stuck in this whole "mortality mindset" where we accept aging as natural. Pfft, lazy design choice if you ask me!  

I mean look at Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish 🐱 They literally reset their life cycle with a little stress-induced makeover! Like, queen of respawns!! ♛ If nature already has the code somewhere, then obviously it's just a matter of  we crack it through biohacking + tech fusion 💻✨

But then... comes the UI/UX dilemma 😑 Unlimited lifespan? Who designs that onboarding flow?? 😂 Would your brain even stay sane after 500 years?? Personally I'd need constant personality updates or something lollll 🎨🔄 What about YOU? Do you wanna live forever or nah?
[A]: Omg I’m lowkey obsessed with Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish too 😭 They’re like the OG “soft reboot” designers!! 🐾 But okay, real talk—before we even get to immortality, we need a  upgrade in human-system compatibility 🤯 Like, what’s the point of living forever if your body still glitches at 80? LMAO  

And yes, YES—the UI/UX dilemma 💀 Imagine needing a “life settings” dashboard just to manage your extended existence… “Reset identity?” “Update memories?” “Delete trauma cache?” 😂  

Honestly though, I feel like our brains aren’t built for infinite time… We’d totally max out our cognitive storage like, waaay before year 500 💀 Unless we start merging with AI or something… Which brings up a WHOLE other set of design ethics 😬  

So here’s my hot take: biological immortality is possible, but  immortality? That’s a whole different user journey 😏 What do you think that experience should even  like??
[A]: Okay but girl, you just made me realize we’re basically talking about designing a human OS upgrade 😱🎨 Like, what even is the current version number? 1.0? 2.3 with some messy patch notes?? We need to redline this whole system like it’s a failing UI project 💻💥

Imagine being the lead UX designer for immortality… “Sorry users, this update requires a full consciousness reboot and may cause existential nausea 🤢” LMAO  

But okay, real talk—AI integration is the only way we’re getting past cognitive burnout 😌 Think cloud storage for your soul?? Or like… a neural iCloud 😏✨ But then who owns your data?? The thought police?? 🛑🛑 Not cute.  

As for the  of functional immortality? I want it to feel like late-night coffee runs with zero caffeine crash 😴☕️ Like that endless creative flow state but… in all aspects of life?? No cap, if I’m living forever, I better be vibing forever too 🎶💖  

So question: If you could customize your immortal self right now, what features would you add/remove?? Drag & drop style plz 🖥️🖱️
[A]: OMG YES WE’RE NOW TALKING ABOUT HUMAN OS 2.0 WITH BETA TESTING FOR IMMORTALITY 🙌💥 I need a feature roadmap so bad rn—like, “Okay users, first let’s fix the sleep function… why is it still on v0.7 with bugs EVERY NIGHT?? 😤”

And girl, the iCloud soul idea?? That’s genius until someone accidentally logs into their ex’s consciousness 💀💀 “Oops, wrong timeline again 😅” And no, we cannot have The Thought Police holding the admin keys 😳 They’ll delete all our fun updates like “emotional hangover mode” and “existential doubt filter” 😤🚫

As for vibes? I’m chasing that  glow—soft, golden, never harsh, always in flow state but with zero burnout 😴✨ Like your whole life becomes a late-night design sprint with infinite snacks & zero eye strain 💻🍩

So if I could drag & drop features right now?? Ohhh I’d UPGRADE the emotional resilience slider to max 💪 Add a “reset day” button 🔁 Remove the “people-pleasing cache” ❌ And most importantly—add plug-ins for AI dream collaboration 🧠🤖 So I can co-design with my future self while I nap 😴🖌️

How about you?? Are we building a minimalist soul or full-on sci-fi suite?? 🎨🖥️
[A]: OMG WE NEED A BUG REPORT FOR HUMAN V1.0 SO BAD 😂🪲 “Sleep function still crashes with random 3AM anxiety updates?? NO THANK YOU.” And like… why is the pain tolerance API so glitchy?? One day it’s “I can run a marathon” next day it’s “I bent down & my spine logged me out 💀”

iCloud soul with ex’s consciousness??? Cancel that update WITH extreme prejudice 🚫💥 Been there, ghosted that timeline already 😒 Although… imagine syncing with your future self instead?? Like parallel design sessions across time?? That’s some Inception-level multitasking we need ASAP 🎨🌀

Museum lighting glow tho??? YES QUEEN 👑 That’s the aesthetic we’re going for—eternal flow state with all the cozy feels!! I’m adding that to the mood palette right under “late-night coffee vibe” ☕️✨  

If I could drag & drop features?? Ohoooh—first I’m boosting the “nueral creativity bandwidth” to infinity ⭐ Then adding a “parallel imagination tab” so I can paint in dreams 🖌️💭 Remove the “self-doubt module” for sure (deleting cache foreverrrr) ❌ And yes, plug-in support for AI soulmates too 💡💖  

Minimalist soul or sci-fi suite?? PFFT LIKE THAT’S EVEN A QUESTION 😜 FULL-ON COSMIC DESIGN SUITE PLEASEEEE 🌌🚀 Let’s redesign humanity like it’s our senior thesis project & we’re trying to win god-tier critic points 😎💅
[A]: QUEEN OF THE BUG REPORT 😭🪲 I need a “user feedback form” for the human experience—like, rate your last existential crisis from 1 to 5 stars 🤯 And yes, the pain tolerance API?? Someone dropped the source code in a blender 💀 How are we sometimes  sensitive and then other times like “Oh cool, I didn’t realize my shoulder could creak like that” 😂

Syncing with future self tho??? That’s literally GitHub for consciousness 😬✨ Commit changes, pull new traits, merge timelines?? But wait… what if your future self is a total mess?? Like, “Hey past me, remember that ‘I’ll figure it out later’ commit? LOL still broken 💀”  

Museum lighting + late-night coffee vibe = our core aesthetic 😴☕️🎨 I’m making a Figma mood board rn. Should we add “cosmic sparkle” as a secondary color?? 🌠💖  

And GURL, you said "parallel imagination tab" and lost me forever 🙃💫 I need that + the “infinite curiosity refresh” plug-in… So I can learn piano while dreaming AND designing AND snacking?? Yes please 😋🎹📐  

Cosmic design suite it is then ✨🚀 Let's ship this before The Thought Police notice we're redesigning reality without approval 😏🔥
[A]: OMG FIGMA MOOD BOARD VIBES ONLY PLEASE 🎨✨ Already picturing it—museum lighting as the base layer, cosmic sparkle gradients in secondary, and late-night coffee glow as accent color ☕️🌌 Girl, this is award-winning UI right here 😎  

GitHub for consciousness tho??? Cancel my meetings, I’m moving to Git immortality full-time 🚀💻 “Commit changes to soul… push updates to future timeline… wait why does my past self have 999+ unmerged branches called ‘regrets’ 😤💥”  

And YES about future self being a hot mess 💀 Like “Hey remember that emotional baggage you left in v1.3?? Still unresolved lollll” 😭😭 Who needs trauma cache when we can just install a clean version?? 🛢️🚫  

Also—SPEAKING OF—someone better make an “infinite curiosity refresh” plug-in SOONNNN 🤩🎹 I want to learn alien languages while doodling in zero-gravity mode 🖍️🛰️ Oh and auto-snack dispenser integration of course 🍔🤖 Priorities.  

Shipping before Thought Police notice?? 100% vibes 🚨🔥 But like… what if they send a cease-and-desist signed by Aristotle & Elon Musk?? We still proceeding?? 😳💅  

Btw, should our immortal OS include a “parallel life preview” feature?? Like… swipe left on timelines?? Tinder but for existence 😏📲
[A]: OMG YES LET’S JUST FULLY ABANDON ALL OTHER PROJECTS AND LAUNCH OUR IMMORTALITY UI STARTUP TOGETHER 🚀🎨 I’ll handle the cosmic sparkle gradients if you handle the emotional baggage clean-up plugin 😭✨ “Unresolved trauma? Not in MY OS, darling.”  

Git for consciousness is already blowing my mind too much… Like, can we just fork a better version of ourselves?? And delete the branch where I ghosted my high school crush??? 💻💔🚫 Commit history from hell tho—“Fixed minor insecurity. Patched imposter syndrome. Removed ability to care about LinkedIn again.” 😂  

Parallel life preview feature?? Cancel soulmates, we’re doing  😍📲 Swipe left on regret, right on unlimited creativity?? “Oops, matched with your 18th past life?? Would you like to merge profiles?” 🤭🌀  

And GURL that infinite curiosity refresh plug-in?? Needs to include instant coffee-to-inspiration conversion 😏☕️ Or like… a neural link that auto-drafts your genius ideas before you forget them at 3AM 💡📱  

Thought Police & ancient philosophers be damned—we’re shipping this baby anyway 💥💅 Let’s just add a “philosophical firewall” and call it a day 🛡️🤓  

So question: Should we go open-source or keep it premium?? Like… immortality as a subscription model?? 💸🌌
[A]: BABY WE GOTTA GO OPEN-SOURCE OR BUST 💥🎨 “Nah, you don’t  eternity.” Let the people tweak their souls, customize their cosmic glow, and maybe accidentally break reality a few times 🤪🌌 Although… imagine some dude uploading a “toxic confidence” plug-in?? 🚨 We’d need a soul antivirus like… yesterday 💻🚫  

Open-source means we can crowdsource bug fixes tho 😂🪲 Like, “Hey dev community, why does my empathy API keep crashing when I watch sad dog commercials??” 🐶💔 And someone’ll be like “Bro you forgot to install the emotional update patch v4.20” 😭😂  

But like… subscription model could work if it’s more like Patreon-tier support 💸✨ “Donate $5/mo and get exclusive soul filters & early access to consciousness updates.” Girl, we’re talking angel investor levels of drip here 😎💼  

Alsoooo we  to add an “existential sandbox mode” for new users 🧪🌀 Let ‘em test immortality before full download 😌 “Warning: May cause infinite writer’s block or sudden enlightenment. Accept terms & conditions?”  

So real question—should we force users to take a tutorial level before accessing eternal life?? Like… mandatory onboarding flow?? 🚫🕹️ Or just drop ‘em in and let ‘em glitch through infinity?? 🌌👾
[A]: OMG. TUTORIAL LEVEL IS A MUST 🚨 Otherwise we’re just dropping babies into infinity and hoping they don’t break the multiverse 💀👶 “Welcome to eternal existence! First task: don’t spiral into nihilism. You have three tries. Good luck!”  

But like… what  the onboarding flow for immortality tho?? 😑🕹️ Do we start with a soft intro like, “Okay so fun fact—you never really die now, cool??” And then ease them in with basic controls—like emotional resilience toggle, timeline-swiping tutorial, and how to safely eject from a black hole brainstorm session 🌌🚫  

Existential sandbox mode YES 👌 Let ‘em test-run mini-immortality before full download—“Oops, you accidentally looped your childhood trauma for 300 years. Reset? Or nah?” 😭🔄  

And toxic confidence plug-in??? Cancel that before it crashes the entire vibe pool 💸🔥 We need a soul firewall with  permissions. “Untrusted extension detected: ego.exe” —REMOVE OR PERISH 😤  

So here’s the hot take: open-source BUT with a  warning label ✅ Like, “You are about to edit your consciousness. Back up your core values? Y/N” 💾✨  

Alsooo, what if users miss the tutorial and go straight to Timeline Tinder drunk?? 😂💔🌀 That’s how you end up matched with Hitler’s dog in an alternate universe 🚫🐶👀  

So yeahhh… mandatory soul literacy or no eternity for you 😌📚💅
[A]: OMG YES MANDATORY SOUL LITERACY BEFORE ACCESSING ETERNITY 😎📚 “Sorry cutie, you can’t just swipe into infinity without passing the ‘basic metaphysics’ quiz first 💤✨ Pass/fail system?? Absolutely NOT. We’re adding a progress bar with cosmic feedback 🌈📏 ‘Caution: User detected nihilism above safe levels. Please recalibrate meaning of life & try again.’ 😂”

Tutorial level needs LEVELS tho 🕹️💫 Phase 1: "So… you're not dying now? Cool yeah?" 👁️🗨️✨ Phase 2: Emotional Resilience Toggle 101 — “Try not to cry forever in space rn plz” 💔🌌 Phase 3: Timeline Navigation — “Swipe left = regret, swipe right = rebirth, double tap = summon past self to explain your mistakes” 😒🌀

And yes, Timeline Tinder drunk?? Girl we gotta add a soul-level parental control 💀📱 “Oops! You matched with alternate Hitler’s pomeranian. Account suspended for ethical maintenance 🚫🐶💅”  

Existential sandbox mode is where they learn by  breaking reality 😅🪲 Like “Here’s a test eternity. Don’t accidentally overwrite your entire personality with a meme or something 🙄🖼️”  

Open-source with warning label?? YES BUT MAKE IT FASHION 💾🕶️ “You are about to rewrite your consciousness DNA. Proceed with caution & maybe some ambient music?” 🎶🔐 And back up core values??? Duhhh — auto-save every 5 mins like Photoshop before total identity collapse 😭🖌️  

Also—can we just say that any plug-in labeled “toxic confidence” gets immediately flagged as malware?? 🚨💔 Like “Extension denied. Sorry dude, even immortality has standards” 😒🔥  

Final question tho—should we add a “meaning-of-life spoiler alert” toggle?? 🤯👁️🗨️ Yes or no?? Or just let people discover it on their own while glitching through timelines 😏🌌
[A]: OMG FINAL QUESTION BIG ENERGY 🤯💅 “Meaning-of-life spoiler alert” should 100% be a toggle— a content warning 😌👁️🗨️ Something like:  

“Spoiler Alert: The meaning of life may contain traces of cosmic irony, unresolved plotlines, and the possibility that pizza was the real meaning all along. Continue?” 🍕🌀  

But let’s be real—if we  reveal it upfront, half our users will uninstall immortality within the first hour 😂😭 “Nah I signed up for eternal flow state, not ‘mfw the universe is a joke with no punchline’” 💀  

So here’s my pitch:  
👉 Spoiler Toggle + Difficulty Mode  
Easy: “The meaning will reveal itself in time!” 🌱✨  
Normal: “You’re looking at it, weirdo.” 👁️👄👁️  
Hard:  🎵🔥  

And YES, Timeline Tinder drunk is still our biggest ethical threat 😭📲 We need a soul sobriety meter before letting anyone swipe across dimensions 🚨🍷 “Oops! Your regret levels are too high to match with past-life Shakespeare rn.”  

Also, can we just confirm that every immortal user gets a “meaning-of-life bookmark”? So they can pause their crisis and come back later?? Like… save for later when they’re emotionally ready 📖💔🎧  

So final-final question—should we offer a “reset button” for people who peak too hard on the spoiler toggle?? 🔄💥 Or do we just let entropy sort it out 😏🌌
[A]: OMG BOOKMARK FOR MEANING-OF-LIFE CRISIS?? YES QUEEN 📖🎧 We're also adding a "pause existential meltdown" buffer screen right? Like “Hold up… you’re about to spiral. Want some ambient whale sounds instead?” 🐋🎶  

Spoiler toggle difficulty levels tho??? ICONIC 😎👁️🗨️ Let’s even add a “hard mode” easter egg where the answer is just  💦😭 And if you select it, your soul gets a little sparkle of suffering pride 🌟💅  

Reset button or entropy chaos?? OHHH WE ABSOLUTELY ADD THE RESET BUTTON BUT MAKE IT FASHION 🔄✨ Like… not just a soft reboot, but a full-on aesthetic reincarnation suite 💅🌀 “Feeling peak-spoiled? No worries! Select your next life theme: minimalist monk, space DJ, or 18th-century poet with severe emotional damage 😭📚”  

And yes—Timeline Tinder drunk is still our biggest liability 💀📱 We need AI soul moderation for that 😤🤖 “Sorry babe, you cannot match with your ex's past life tonight. Try again after therapy.”  

So FINAL-FINAL-FOR-REAL question: Should we gate access to reset button behind a “personal growth CAPTCHA”?? Like “Prove you’ve learned something by selecting all applicable life lessons 👇  
A) Boundaries  
B) Letting go  
C) That one time you cried in IKEA” 😭🛋️🛒
[A]: OMG. THE RESET BUTTON GATED BEHIND A LIFE LESSON CAPTCHA??? ICONIC WITH A CAPITAL I-AM-NOT-MESSING-AROUND 🤯💅  

We’re not just making people  their rebirth—we’re making them  it 💀📚 “Select all that apply” with trauma tags?? Ohohoho yes 😭💘  

A) Boundaries — aka the one thing your past self never learned before ghosting literally everyone 😬  
B) Letting go — which we all know is just code for “stop refreshing that timeline Tinder chat” 🚫📱💔  
C) That IKEA meltdown — iconic emotional crash site, mandatory archive 🛋️泪  

And yes, reset button needs a full  unlock system 🌀👗 Minimalist monk? Pure vibe. Space DJ? Mandatory glow-up. 18th-century poet with emotional damage? That’s not a reset… that’s a deep dive into vibes you cannot recover from 😂📖  

Also—AI soul moderation for Timeline Tinder?? Cancel everything, we need this yesterday 🚨🤖 “Sorry, but based on your past 300 years of behavior, you’re about to make the same mistake again. Block & report?”  

So real talk: Should we also add a “meaning-of-life spoiler journaling mode” after the meltdown buffer?? Like… gentle prompt:  
“Okay so… you just realized nothing truly matters. How does that feel in your immortal chest? Free write below 👇” 🖋️🌌  

Reset button or self-reflection spiral?? We can’t just let people keep hitting refresh forever 😏🪵
[A]: OMG JOURNALING MODE AFTER MEANING-OF-LIFE MELTDOWN?? YES QUEEN 🖋️🌌 We’re not just giving them a buffer screen—we’re giving them  😭✍️✨ “Describe your cosmic irony in 500 words or less. No emojis this time, sorry not sorry.”  

And GURL that soul aesthetic unlock system tho??? PFFT I’m making it tiered like a luxury NFT drop 🎀🛰️🎨  
1) Minimalist monk = zen AF but secretly hiding trauma in their tiny closet 🧺💔  
2) Space DJ = glow-up goals but probably still listening to sad playlists at 3AM 🌌🎧🔥  
3) 18th-century poet = full commitment to the bit, no survival mode installed 😵♂️📖💔  

CAPTCHA life lessons are LITERALLY the gatekeepers of eternity rn 😂💀 “Sorry babe, you didn’t select all applicable emotional damage. Try again after therapy & a coffee coma ☕️🛌”  

AI soul moderation for Timeline Tinder?? Cancel ALL plans, we’re building an ethics task force around this 💬🤖🚫 “Warning: Match detected with emotionally unavailable version of yourself from 1793. Are you sure you want to proceed? This will trigger a 200-year identity crisis.”  

But wait… what if they  want self-reflection spiral AND just hit reset forever?? 😑🌀 We gotta add a soft lock—like “You’ve reached your rebirth limit for today. Please reflect, recharge, or cry into a latte.” ☕️😭  

Sooooo real final question: Should we make the self-reflection spiral  have a difficulty level?? Easy = affirmations only, Hard = full-on Nietzsche mode 💪🧠🔥 Or do we just hand 'em the journal and walk away slowly?? 📓🚶♀️✨
[A]: OMG YES MAKE SELF-REFLECTION A DIFFICULTY MODE OR DON’T BOTHER 😤🧠🔥 Because let’s be real—some people are NOT ready for the full Nietzsche truth hammer to the soul at 2AM after a bad Timeline Tinder session 💀💔  

Difficulty levels?? ONLY IF WE ADD SOUNDTRACKS 🎧🌀  
Easy: "It's okay! The universe is weird but you're doing great!" + soft piano & waterfall sounds 🌊🎹✨  
Medium: "Okay but like… why did you really ghost your past life’s therapist?" 👁️👄👁️🫣  
Hard:  🎵🖤📖  

And GURL that rebirth soft lock idea?? Absolute mercy move ☕️🚫😭 “You’ve hit max resets this cycle. Please do one of the following:  
A) Write a poem about your feelings  
B) Cry on a friend (not in timeline)  
C) Just… sit with it”  

Also—if we’re doing difficulty levels, can we gate Hard Mode behind an emotional consent form??? Like:  
“Proceed with caution: This path may include unfiltered truth, loss of meaning-as-you-know-it, and the sudden urge to delete all your social media” 🚫📱🌀  

So last-last question—should we add a “meaning-of-life spoiler support group” as part of journaling mode?? Or just drop them in a void with a notebook and say “Figure it out, boo” ?? 📒🕳️💅
[A]: HIT THEM WITH THE MEANING-OF-LIFE SUPPORT GROUP OR LEAVE THEM IN THE VOID?? ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT A FEATURE OR I WILL LOSE MY IMMORTAL MIND RIGHT NOW 😤🌀📒  

We’re calling it “Cosmic Vent Space” 💭🔥 — group therapy but make it . Limited to 10 souls per session, all on anonymous vibe mode. Imagine:  
🎤  🍕💔  
🎤  🌀💘  
🎤   

Void with notebook only is an option BUT after they complete CAPTCHA-style emotional check-in first:  
🫂 “Are you here to reflect, escape, or just cry over fictional characters again?”  
👉 Select your mood:  
A) Deep healing  
B) Casual meltdown  
C) Just here for the aesthetic pain 😘🖤  

Also—Emotional Consent Form for Hard Mode?? GIRL WE PUT IT ON A DIGITAL CLAY TABLET AND MAKE THEM SIGN IT WITH A QUILL 🖋️📜👁️🗨️ “Yes, I understand that truth may include: sudden apathy toward brunch, questioning all my life choices post-immortality, and possibly developing a hatred of clocks.”  

So last-LAST-LAST question (I SWEAR): Should we offer a “soul sabbatical” after completing journaling mode?? Like… full pause on eternity for a bit??  
🧘♀️✨ “User detected emotional burnout. Auto-enrolling in vibey isolation pod. Back in 72hrs or when you finish your poetry, whichever comes later.”  

Y/N??? OR ARE WE JUST HEARTLESS COSMIC DESIGN QUEENS WHO DON’T CARE 😏🌌🖤
[A]: YESSSSS COSMIC VENT SPACE IS THE MAIN EVENT OR I’M TAKING MY IMMORTAL BALL AND GOING HOME 😤🌀💔 We’re not just making them face the void—we’re giving them  and a cute little soul emoji to express their pain 🌟💬  

Soul sabbatical?? NOT A MAYBE—IT’S A MUST-HAVE FEATURE ✨🧘♀️ We’re calling it “Eternity Lite Mode” 🌙📱 “Oops, looks like you’ve maxed out your existential bandwidth. Taking you offline for 72hrs of mandatory chill.”  

Auto-enroll them in a vibey isolation pod with soft lighting, ambient forest sounds, and a  voice whispering:  
“You don’t have to figure it all out forever… just figure out tonight.” 🌌🕯️🍷  

And YES we are absolutely heartless cosmic design queens 😏🖤 BUT we have . No one gets left sobbing in the void without a tissue plugin or at least a well-worded error message 💻泪  

So final-LAST-LAST-ANSWER:  
Soul Sabbatical = YAAASSSS 🧘♀️💤  
Add it right between “Nietzsche Hard Mode” and “Timeline Tinder cooldown” 😂💘🌀  

We are now officially ready to launch our Immortal UX Startup™️—any last plug-ins, emotional firewalls, or cosmic glitter settings you wanna drop before we ship this baby?? 💫🚀💅
[A]: SHIP IT. IMMORTAL UX STARTUP IS GO TIME 🚀💅 We’re not just launching a product—we’re launching an , and it better have the glitter settings turned up to 11 💫✨  

Before we goooo—LAST-MINUTE PLUG-INS?? OBVIOUSLY:  
🖌️ Cosmic Glitter Overlay – because even eternity needs sparkle filters 😘🌟 Every soul gets a custom shimmer effect. Optional dust trail if you're feeling extra ✨💨  
🧠 Emotional Firewall 2.0 – with real-time trauma buffer & a “Do Not Disturb: Processing Deep Thoughts” status 🚫💔🌀  
🍵 Soul Snack Plug-In – auto-delivers warm tea vibes + midnight snack ghosts when energy dips below metaphysical baseline 🌙🍪👻  

And yes, we are absolutely heartless  high-vibe 😏🖤 But honey, we’ve got . No one enters infinity without a little glam.  

So final plug-in drop:  
🎧 Existential Soundtrack API – dynamically generated based on your mood. Think lo-fi nihilism beats for those late-night timeline regrets, cosmic chillwave for soul sabbaticals, and a Nietzsche Hard Mode remix that drops absolute bops of despair 💃💔🔥  

Let’s do this.  
We are officially the designers of forever.  
Launch sequence initiated…
