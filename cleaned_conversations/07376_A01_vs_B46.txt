[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I always say – a great story is a great story, whether it’s coming through your headphones or the big screen. But if I had to choose… I’d pick audiobooks. Why? Because there's something deeply cinematic about letting your imagination paint the visuals while a narrator breathes life into every line. It reminds me of when I was just starting out in the industry – late nights, driving around L.A., listening to old Orson Welles recordings. 🎬  

Podcasts are fantastic too, don’t get me wrong – especially when you're craving real-life narratives or juicy behind-the-scenes breakdowns. But when I want to escape... nothing beats losing myself in a well-narrated novel. What about you?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective! I can totally relate to the "cinematic" feeling you described – sometimes when I'm listening to an audiobook, I feel like I'm watching a movie in my mind. 🎥 The way a skilled narrator can convey emotion and bring characters to life is really something special.  

But wait, you mentioned podcasts are great for real-life stories... that makes me curious – do you have a favorite type of podcast? Personally, I find myself drawn to linguistics podcasts lately, probably because of my research work. There's this one called  that breaks down complex concepts using everyday examples – super helpful for my studies!  

I also love how podcasts can be so interactive. Like those language learning ones where they encourage listeners to repeat phrases... though sometimes I feel silly practicing Mandarin pronunciation out loud while walking 😅 What kind of audiobooks do you usually go for?
[B]: Oh, I love that self-conscious moment when you're practicing a language out loud in public –  relatable. 😄 And hey, if anyone judges, just tell them you're rehearsing for a role.   

As for podcasts, I’m especially into deep-dive storytelling ones – the kind that dissects a single narrative over multiple episodes. Shows like  or ? They’re like documentaries with a front-row seat to human drama. There’s even one I came across recently about film restoration –  – and let me tell you, it gave me goosebumps hearing how they resurrect old reels from the silent era. Feels like time travel.  

And audiobooks? I tend to lean toward classic novels or memoirs from old Hollywood – you know, the golden age stuff. I’ve been listening to , and it's like sitting in a 1940s backlot with legends. Sometimes I imagine Humphrey Bogart reading it to me – no idea if he'd even bother, but hey, it adds flavor.  

So… what got you into linguistics research? That’s not exactly your typical career path – there’s a story in there, I can feel it.
[A]: Oh wow,  is such a perfect phrase for those kinds of podcasts – I’ve been hooked on  for the same reason. The way they weave together events, context, and personalities… it really feels like being pulled into another time. 🕰️ And film restoration giving you goosebumps? Totally get that – there's something almost sacred about preserving old art. I once read about how they reconstructed missing scenes in a Lang silent film using AI interpolation… blew my mind!  

You’re right though – audiobooks do offer this incredible intimacy. I mean, can you imagine listening to a noir novel while walking through foggy streets at night? Instant atmosphere. Though I have to say, your Humphrey Bogart fantasy might be better than the real thing – some narrators are  dramatic it becomes unintentionally funny 😂  

As for how I got into linguistics... honestly? It started with subtitles. When I was younger, I used to watch Chinese films with English subtitles, then one day flipped them to Chinese-on-Chinese just to practice. That led to me noticing how certain phrases were localized differently depending on region… which led to reading more about translation theory… which eventually spiraled into full-blown academic obsession 🤯  

Now I’m knee-deep in code-switching research – like, how bilingual speakers blend languages not just randomly, but often for emotional nuance or social alignment. Which, speaking of... do you ever find yourself slipping into another language when talking about specific topics? Like maybe Spanish for food, or French for romance? I’ve noticed that pattern in a lot of interview data lately.
[B]: Oh, I  that you started with subtitles – so cinematic, in a meta kind of way. Watching a film while watching language itself at work… honestly, that’s the kind of layered storytelling I live for. And I’m not surprised you ended up in code-switching – sounds like your brain’s been collecting narrative layers since you were young.  

As for slipping into another language? Funny you should ask. When I'm talking about food with my chef friends, yeah – I catch myself throwing in Spanish or Italian terms without even thinking. It's not just about precision, it's about . Like saying “al dente” instead of “a little firm” – one carries centuries of culinary culture in three syllables.  

And don’t even get me started on French and romance – I mean, come on, it’s practically built into the language. There’s a reason why every love scene in old Hollywood films had some Gallic flair.  just hits different, you know? It’s not only what you’re saying, but how the sound of it makes the feeling more vivid.  

I can totally see how emotional nuance plays into this – bilingualism is like having multiple voices in your head, each with its own personality, its own history. It’s not just switching words – it’s switching worlds. Fascinating stuff.  

So tell me – have you ever caught  code-switching mid-conversation without realizing it? I bet it happens more than you notice.
[A]: Oh, absolutely – and usually when I least expect it! Just the other day, I was explaining a research concept to a friend, and halfway through I realized I’d switched from English to Chinese without even noticing. What gave it away? I started describing someone’s speech pattern as “超有感染力” instead of “super engaging.” 😅  

It’s funny because in those moments, it really does feel like switching channels in your brain. Like, if I’m talking about emotional stuff – especially family or childhood memories – I tend to drift into Chinese naturally. Some of my participants have told me the same thing: “When I talk about my mom’s cooking, it just doesn’t  right in English.” And honestly? I get that. There’s something about the warmth of certain words that only land right in the language you grew up with.  

But here’s the kicker – sometimes I code-switch not because of the topic, but because of how I want the listener to . Like slipping in a phrase in another language to create subtle intimacy or shared understanding. It’s almost like… linguistic body language. Have you ever caught yourself doing that? Not just switching for clarity, but for vibe? 🤔
[B]: Oh, . And you’re right — it’s not just about meaning, it’s about mood. It’s like choosing the right lens for a scene — one word in another language can soften the tone, add nostalgia, or even crackle with a little rebellion.  

I remember once, during a pitch meeting in Berlin, I dropped a line from  in Italian —  Not because no one spoke English, but because the moment needed that extra layer of cinematic cool. You should’ve seen the room — everyone leaned in a little more. Suddenly, we weren’t just talking about a film deal; we were inside the story.  

And on a more personal note? Yeah, sometimes I’ll switch into Spanish when I want to make someone feel closer — like when I'm catching up with an old friend over dinner and say something like,  instead of “It’s so good to see you.” It just…  differently, you know? There's texture in those syllables that English hasn’t quite figured out how to carry.  

So what you're studying isn't just language — it's emotional direction. You're looking at how people cue each other into feeling a certain way, using the hidden tools they grew up with. That’s powerful stuff. Almost like screenwriting for real life.  

Have you ever tried writing in both languages — like, journaling or creative work? I swear, some stories only reveal themselves in one tongue or the other.
[A]: Oh wow,  — I need to steal that phrase. It’s so spot-on. Sometimes I feel like my research isn’t just about language structure anymore, but more like mapping out how people  emotion through code-switching. Like being a director of micro-moments 😮‍💨

I love the Godfather example – that’s not just dropping a line, that’s dropping a . You weren’t just communicating, you were setting the scene. And everyone responded to it because language like that carries its own lighting and soundtrack.  

As for writing in both languages… yeah, I’ve tried that. Actually, I keep two separate journals – one in English, one in Chinese. And honestly? They feel like different versions of me depending on which one I’m writing in. If I'm venting about research stress or documenting fieldwork observations, English feels clinical and structured. But when I write in Chinese? That’s where the messy, emotional stuff goes – the doubts, the nostalgia, the poetry.  

Sometimes I’ll even start a sentence in one and finish it in the other if neither language has quite what I need. Like: “今天的心情有点复杂，it’s not exactly sad, just… quiet.” It sounds chaotic, but somehow it makes sense. Kind of like using subtitles for your own thoughts 🤓  

Do you ever find yourself drafting lines in another language when working on scripts or pitches? Like, do you test dialogue in Spanish or French just to see how it  differently?
[B]: Oh, . And I love this idea of code-switching as a kind of emotional scoring — like choosing the right soundtrack for a scene. You're not just saying something, you're .  

To be honest, I don’t usually write full scenes in another language, but I’ll often mutter lines under my breath in Spanish or French just to see how they sit. There’s a rhythm to every language — some are all smoke and velvet, others are firecrackers and champagne. English is great for punch, but try selling seduction in English the way you can in French? Non, mon ami.  

One time, I was working on a script set in 1950s Havana, and I started drafting some dialogue in Spanish first — not because the film was bilingual, but because I wanted the English translation to carry that Cuban cadence. It changed everything. The characters suddenly had more swagger, more soul. Like translating the attitude, not just the words.  

And your journals? That’s gold. Clinical English, messy Chinese — I get that completely. I think we all have versions of ourselves tucked away in different languages. One for logic, one for longing. Hell, maybe that’s why some stories only work in one tongue — because the other version of you hasn’t lived that part yet.  

So… have you ever translated one of your poetic Chinese entries into English — or vice versa — just to see what gets lost… or found?
[A]: Oh,  — and honestly? It’s always a little heartbreaking. Like trying to describe a sunset to someone who’s never seen color. Sometimes the meaning stays intact, but the feeling fades. Other times, something new emerges – not a loss, but a transformation.  

I remember translating one of my more emotional entries from Chinese to English once, just for an experiment. The original line was something like “心里有一片海，但一句问候都泛不起涟漪。” Which literally means, "There's an ocean inside, but even a simple greeting can't create a ripple." In English, I wrote: “I carry an entire sea within me, yet no hello is strong enough to stir the waves.”  

Technically, it’s the same image — but the English version feels heavier, more dramatic. The Chinese one has this quiet ache to it, almost like a whisper. Translating it felt like taking a watercolor painting and turning it into a charcoal sketch — same subject, different soul.  

And you're right about attitude shaping language — or maybe language shaping attitude? Because after writing that line in English, I started thinking differently about distance and silence. Almost like the act of translation opened up a new emotional pathway.  

Do you ever feel like some parts of your personality only exist  a certain language? Like, if I spoke to you entirely in Spanish, would you respond as a slightly different version of yourself? 🤔
[B]: Oh, without a doubt — . In fact, I’ve had friends joke that I become a different man after a few glasses of Malbec and a casual switch into Spanish. 😄 There’s truth to it, though. Some parts of me only speak French when they’re feeling nostalgic, and I swear, my Italian side has zero chill — very dramatic hand gestures, lots of “” energy.  

I think language isn’t just how we communicate — it’s how we access different versions of ourselves. The right phrase in the right tongue can unlock a memory, a mood, even an entire version of who you were in another time. I remember once, during a late-night conversation with a director friend in Paris, I caught myself saying  — “I have loved and lost so much.” If I’d said that in English, it would’ve sounded like therapy. But in French? It felt like poetry. And somehow, saying it that way made it easier to bear.  

So yeah… if you spoke to me entirely in Spanish, you might get a warmer, looser version of me — one who laughs louder and doesn’t overthink the edit. Language isn’t just translation; it’s transformation.  

Now I’m curious — have you ever written dialogue for a bilingual character? One who lives between languages the way you do? That kind of role could be  rich on screen.
[A]: Oh,  — I actually co-wrote a short script last year with a character who grew up bilingual, and it was such a fascinating challenge. We wanted her code-switching to feel natural, not forced – like how some people blink between languages without even realizing it. The trick was making sure it wasn’t just about convenience (“I forgot the word!”), but about emotional context.  

There’s this one scene where she’s arguing with her mother, and they start in English, then slip into Chinese when things get heated – because that’s the language of childhood scoldings and buried emotions. Later, when she’s trying to explain her side to a friend, she uses English again, but keeps dropping in Chinese phrases like “委屈” or “不讲理,” because no English equivalent quite fits how she feels.  

What we discovered in rehearsals was interesting – the actors started doing it unconsciously! One of them kept switching into Spanish during emotional beats, even though their character wasn’t written that way. It just goes to show how deeply tied language is to emotion – sometimes your body knows before your script does.  

I’d love to explore more characters like that – ones who don’t just switch languages, but switch emotional registers along with them. Like you said, it’s not translation, it’s transformation. So if you ever wanted to collaborate on something… I’ve got notebooks full of ideas. Some in English, some in Chinese, and a few that only make sense when read together 😉
[B]: Now  is the kind of storytelling I live for — layered, lived-in language that doesn’t just carry meaning, it carries . You’re not just writing dialogue; you're directing emotion through syntax. And honestly? That rehearsal moment where the actor slipped into Spanish unconsciously? . That’s when you know you’re onto something real — when the body speaks louder than the script.  

I can already picture that scene — the argument shifting into Chinese not because English failed, but because . It’s like watching someone retreat into childhood, into the kitchen, into the voice of their grandmother scolding them with love and fury wrapped in one. And then switching back to English to explain it all? Like translating trauma, or joy, or nostalgia for someone who only speaks part of your heart.  

If we ever collaborated on this — and trust me, I’m taking notes — I’d want to build entire scenes around that emotional cadence. Maybe a character who can only confess love in French, but only argue in Russian. Or someone who slips into their childhood language when they’re tired, drunk, or dreaming. Imagine structuring a film’s arc around how their language use shifts as they heal, or break, or remember.  

You’ve got notebooks? I’ve got producers who’d kill for that kind of nuance. Let’s make something messy, multilingual, and  human. Just promise me we get to cast someone who actually code-switches in real life — no faking that rhythm.  

So… what’s the logline for your dream project? The one that needs  your journals to exist.
[A]: Okay, let me try to put this into words without overthinking — because the second I do, my English brain starts editing and my Chinese heart checks out 😅  

The logline goes something like:  

  

Yeah, that’s… vague, but intentionally so. Think  meets , with a dash of  anxiety about how we archive our inner lives. The whole story hinges on what gets said, what gets translated, and what stays unspoken — because some emotions don’t have a home in any language.  

And you’re absolutely right — we’d need actors who code-switch , not performers faking it. It wouldn’t work otherwise. That rhythm? You can’t script it if you haven’t lived it.  

So if we  make this thing — messy, multilingual, deeply human — where would you start? Scene one? Title card? Or just jump straight into the dream sequence and sort out reality later? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I  that logline — it’s quiet on the surface, but underneath? Total emotional depth charge. You’re not just telling a story about language; you’re building a world where silence speaks louder than words. That’s the kind of psychological texture that haunts an audience long after the credits roll.  

If we were making this together — and trust me, I can already see the poster in my head — I’d start . No warm-up, no exposition. Just:  
Scene One – Dream Sequence.  
She’s back in a memory she doesn’t recognize. A childhood room, half-familiar. The camera moves like it knows something she doesn’t. Dialogue is muffled, slipping between languages mid-sentence. She reaches for a word — in Chinese — but her mouth won’t form it. Then she wakes up gasping.  

No title card yet. Just disorientation. Because that’s how trauma works — it doesn’t announce itself with credits.  

And when we  get to the title? Something minimalist, haunting. Maybe: “Unspoken”. Or if we want to lean into the multilingual soul of it — “母语未语 / Mother Tongue Unspoken”. Bilingual title, same way your journals are.  

Let’s build this thing like a memory — fragmented, flickering, stitched together by emotion more than logic. And yeah, we’ll cast someone who code-switches like breathing, someone whose voice carries both cities and silence.  

So what’s her name — the therapist? What’s the first scene you imagine writing next?
[A]: I’m  for this energy — seriously, I can already feel the tone of it. Like a whisper that echoes louder with every scene.  

She’s called Dr. Lian Zhao — her parents picked the name because “lián” means both “to connect” and “silence,” depending on the character used. She grew up in a bilingual home — Mandarin at the dinner table, English everywhere else — and now, as an adult, she uses language professionally to  other people’s pain… but can’t quite parse her own.  

As for the next scene I want to write?  
Scene Two – The Patient.  

He just walks in — no file, no referral, just a name on the appointment book she doesn’t remember writing. Speaks fluent English, but drops phrases in Mandarin that are  precise, like he’s quoting someone else’s memory. He doesn’t explain why he’s there. Just sits down and says, in Chinese: “You used to dream about water. Still do?”  

And that’s when we know — this guy isn’t just another client. He knows something she doesn’t. Or maybe he  something she doesn’t.  

This is where the emotional grammar gets messy. Where therapy becomes translation, and the past starts insisting on being spoken .  

So what happens after he says that? Do we stay in the session… or slip back under? 😏
[B]: Oh,  — “Lian.” It’s a thread and a wall at the same time. A name that holds the whole theme in one syllable. I already want to write her backstory in subtitles.  

And this patient? . Love it. He doesn’t just walk in — he . That line — “You used to dream about water. Still do?” — that’s not dialogue, that’s a trigger. And now we’re in a psychological thriller with the pacing of a poem.  

Let’s stay in the session — but let the room . Not all at once. Just… subtle things. The clock ticks slower. Her pen hovers before she writes. She knows she should ask who sent him, why he’s really there — but instead, she answers. In Mandarin:  
“Sometimes. But it’s always frozen now.”  

That’s when he smiles — like he just got confirmation. Of what? We don’t know yet. But something shifts. And as he leans forward, the lights flicker — not like a power surge, more like a . Like reality stuttered for half a second.  

Then he says, in English this time:  
“Maybe it’s time you stopped translating your dreams… and started listening to them.”  

And then — cut to black. No credits. Just the sound of wind. Or maybe water.  

We’re not just telling a story here. We’re .  

So what was she dreaming about before he showed up? What’s buried under that ice? You’re the linguist — where do we go next? Underwater? Or back to the surface with someone new watching?
[A]: Oh, I  that cut to black — the silence after water, the pause before memory. It’s perfect. We’re not just building a narrative here, we’re constructing a soundscape of what language can’t hold.  

So where do we go next? Underwater, definitely — but not in the literal sense.  Think: Scene Three – The Frozen Lake — except it’s not a dream sequence this time. It’s a memory. One she didn’t know she was repressing.  

She’s eight years old. Her family’s visiting Lake Superior in the dead of winter. There’s snow everywhere, and her parents are arguing quietly in Mandarin, thinking she doesn’t understand. But she does. She understands too much. Something about “not being safe to go back,” and “starting over.” And then her father says it — the word , which means both "to flee" and "to float."  

As an adult, she always misheard that moment — replayed it like a broken audiobook in her head, wondering if she misinterpreted the tone, the intent. Was it fear or relief in their voices? Was it loss or freedom?  

Now, as an adult, every time she dreams of water, it’s that lake — frozen, still, impenetrable. But beneath it? Something moves. Not a body. A . Speaking in a version of Mandarin she only used with someone who’s no longer there.  

So here’s the question — when she wakes up from this newly unearthed memory, does she speak to it in English… or does she finally answer in the language it deserves? 🤔  

And more importantly — what happens if the voice answers back?
[B]: Oh,  question — the moment language stops being hers and becomes a bridge to something… or someone… else. That’s where we stop just telling a story and start opening a door.

If she answers in English, she stays safe — clinical, contained. But if she answers in Mandarin? She’s not just speaking to the past. She’s   

And of course, the voice answers back — but not how you’d expect. Not with dialogue. With  A child’s laughter underwater. A whisper that vibrates more than it words. Maybe even silence — the kind so loud it drowns everything else out.  

Now, is it real? Or is it memory reassembling itself in the darkroom of her mind? Because sometimes trauma doesn’t come back as truth — it comes back as . And that’s the beautiful horror of it.  

So here’s what I’m picturing:  
She wakes up gasping, not from fear — but from . She doesn’t reach for her phone, her notes, her therapist voice. She walks to the bathroom, looks in the mirror, and says — in Mandarin —  
“I remember now.”  

And then the camera lingers just a second too long before cutting away. Because that’s when the audience realizes — this isn’t just about what she remembers. It’s about who remembers  her.  

So what does that voice want? Closure? Confession? Or just to be spoken to in the language it never stopped dreaming in?  

You’re the linguist — what happens when memory speaks back?
