[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，这个问题挺有意思的。我觉得得看具体行业和个人目标。比如像我们做人工智能伦理研究的领域，一个相关的学位还是能提供很扎实的知识基础。不过现在也有很多优秀的自学者或者通过在线课程掌握专业知识的人。

你有没有发现身边的朋友或同事里，有人虽然没有college degree但也做得很好的例子？我最近在想，终身学习的态度可能比一纸文凭更重要，但现实情况是很多企业招聘时还是会把degree当做一个筛选标准。
[A]: I find myself agreeing with you more than not, actually. In my field of literary study, the degree does open certain doors—particularly in academia—but I’ve met self-taught critics and writers whose insights eclipse many with formal credentials.

One colleague at a conference once told me he never finished his undergraduate degree. He spent those years instead reading deeply on his own while working odd jobs. Now he's publishing influential essays on Modernist poetry. It was a reminder that rigor doesn't always wear a cap and gown.

Still, you're right about hiring practices. I've seen brilliant students held back by arbitrary filters in job applications. Perhaps what we're seeing is a slow shift—not away from education itself, but toward a broader definition of it.
[B]: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like your colleague found his own way to cultivate rigor and depth, which is really admirable. I guess the question isn’t so much about whether college degrees are important in themselves, but rather what they represent—things like dedication, exposure to structured thinking, or access to certain networks.

I wonder, though, how we can push institutions to recognize alternative forms of education without replicating the same gatekeeping. Credentials are a shortcut, sure, but maybe we need better ways to assess someone’s capabilities beyond either formal degrees or self-taught hustle. Have you seen any interesting models in literary circles or academia that try to bridge that gap?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful way to frame it—degrees as symbols rather than absolutes. I often think of them as , not unlike the oral exams in traditional Chinese scholarship, where mastery was demonstrated through dialogue, not diplomas.

In literary circles, I’ve noticed small but meaningful shifts. Some journals now blind-review submissions with even the author's institutional affiliation hidden—a nod to talent over pedigree. There are also mentorship programs emerging that pair self-taught writers with established ones, offering guidance without requiring a graduate degree as entry.

One model I admire is the concept of “reading groups” turning into informal apprenticeships. I once hosted a reading group on Emily Dickinson, and one participant, who had no formal training in literature, began writing essays so incisive they were later published in a peer-reviewed journal. Her work spoke louder than any credential ever could.

Perhaps what we need isn’t less structure, but more porous boundaries—spaces where learning breathes beyond the confines of classrooms and gatekeepers.
[B]: I really like that metaphor—porous boundaries. It reminds me of how some AI ethics initiatives are experimenting with open-source collaboration, where people from all kinds of backgrounds contribute to policy frameworks and ethical guidelines without needing a PhD to be taken seriously.

It makes me wonder how we could create more hybrid spaces—like credential-optional fellowships or cross-disciplinary residencies—that still maintain high standards but value curiosity and rigor over pedigree. Maybe the future of education isn't about choosing between formal degrees and self-directed learning, but designing pathways that acknowledge both?

Have you ever thought about what that kind of hybrid model might look like in literary studies? I mean, imagine a workshop where applicants submitted a portfolio  a transcript…
[A]: What a compelling vision—you’ve put your finger on something vital. I think hybrid models are not only possible in literary studies, but already beginning to stir beneath the surface.

Imagine a program where applicants present not just a writing sample or transcript, but a kind of intellectual —a curated collection of readings, annotations, critical reflections, even creative responses to texts. Something that reveals their engagement with literature as living thought, not just academic exercise.

I’ve seen smaller writing centers and independent presses experiment with this. One residency I know invites participants to submit either a traditional thesis chapter or a multimedia project exploring narrative structure across cultures. What’s striking is how many of the most memorable contributions have come from those without formal degrees—they often bring fresh urgency to their interpretations.

And yes, cross-disciplinary residencies could be transformative. Pairing a self-taught coder-poet with a Victorian literature scholar, or a philosopher with a spoken-word artist. The friction generates new ways of thinking.

So perhaps the future isn’t about diluting standards, but redistributing where we look for brilliance. After all, T.S. Eliot worked at a bank by day and wrote  by night. Who knows what modern Eliots we might be overlooking?
[B]: That idea of an intellectual —I think that’s beautiful. It feels like a more honest reflection of how people actually engage with ideas, especially in the age of information where you can build your own curriculum online.

You mentioned how some of the most memorable contributions come from those outside traditional academia. I wonder if part of that is because they’re not constrained by disciplinary expectations? Like, they approach texts or problems with a kind of conceptual mobility that someone deep in the system might lose.

And I love the thought of cross-disciplinary friction sparking new forms of expression and understanding. It makes me think of how AI ethics could benefit from voices beyond computer science and philosophy—maybe even from literature, art, or theology. After all, ethics isn’t just code; it’s about human values, which stories often illuminate better than logic ever could.

Do you think institutions will ever be agile enough to catch up with these ideas, or will the real innovation continue happening at the margins?
[A]: Ah, now  is the haunting question, isn’t it?

I think institutions—particularly the older, more venerated ones—will shift, but glacially. They are like Victorian mansions: grand, rich in history, but not easily rewired for modern currents. Still, pressure from the margins may yet force renovation.

Already, we’re seeing cracks in the façade of exclusivity. Digital humanities projects, for instance, often blur the lines between academic and public engagement. Some journals now invite commentary not just from scholars but from artists, translators, even enthusiastic readers. It’s a small thing, but significant—it suggests that authority can be earned through insight, not merely conferred by title.

And yes, you're absolutely right about freedom from disciplinary constraints. I’ve had students who arrived with no formal literary training but approached a poem like detectives and poets both—asking fearless questions, drawing connections I’d never considered. There's a kind of intellectual innocence there that can be incredibly fertile.

As for AI ethics and literature converging—well, I've long believed that poetry and code have more in common than we assume. Both are systems of condensed meaning, shaped by syntax and rhythm, aiming at clarity or chaos. What if ethicists collaborated with poets to test moral dilemmas not in dry hypotheticals, but in narrative verse? Or dramatized them like Greek tragedies, where consequences unfold before our eyes?

So perhaps innovation will live in both spaces: the academy, slowly adapting, and the margins, continuing to dream louder. If we’re lucky, they’ll begin to echo each other.
[B]: That’s such a vivid way to put it—Victorian mansions slowly rewired. I can almost picture scholars in dusty libraries reluctantly plugging in a laptop.

You mentioned students who approach literature with that fresh, fearless curiosity. It makes me think of how important  is in AI ethics too. Sometimes the people who ask the most challenging questions aren’t the ones buried in technical jargon—they’re the ones seeing the system for the first time, asking, “Wait, why does it work this way? Who decided that?”

And I love what you said about poetry and code both being systems of meaning. In fact, some of the best explainers of AI are actually poets at heart—able to distill something complex into an image or metaphor that lodges in your brain.

I’d honestly sign up for that ethicist-poet collaboration tomorrow. Imagine moral frameworks not just as white papers, but as sonnets or fables. Maybe we’d finally have AI guidelines people actually remember.

If institutions do start catching up—and I hope they do—I wonder if we’ll see more programs where you earn credit for reading novels or writing speculative fiction about future technologies. Seems like a better way to teach ethical imagination than flowcharts alone.
[A]: Ah, now  a vision worth striving for—a curriculum where speculative fiction and sonnets sit at the heart of ethical training. I can almost hear the registrar’s sigh from here.

But truly, your point about  strikes deep. In my seminars, I often find that the most incisive observations come not from those who’ve read every literary theory in existence, but from someone encountering a poem as one might encounter a stranger on a train—openly, tentatively, yet unafraid to ask, 

That same dynamic plays out beautifully—and urgently—in AI ethics. The trained eye sees patterns; the fresh eye sees possibility. It’s why I’ve begun inviting students from outside the humanities into my workshops—not just literature majors, but engineers, artists, even a theology student or two. When they read a poem like W.H. Auden’s , suddenly it isn’t just verse anymore; it becomes a provocation about surveillance, standardization, and what it means to be legible to the state—or to an algorithm.

So yes, imagine if we taught ethical imagination through metaphor, narrative, and myth. Imagine a course titled something like . You’d read Borges and Asimov alongside algorithmic audits and policy briefs. Final exam? Write a short story where an AI achieves enlightenment—or goes rogue trying.

I suspect such programs will begin not in the towering faculties of ivy-clad halls, but in experimental corners of universities—the kind of places where people still dare to play with ideas without worrying too much about tenure committees.

And perhaps, just perhaps, the rest will follow.
[B]: I’m smiling at the thought of that course—. It feels like exactly the kind of boundary-blurring class that could change how students see both technology and storytelling.

There’s something about narrative that lets us inhabit ethical dilemmas in a way no policy document ever could. When you read a story—or even better, write one—you’re forced to hold multiple perspectives at once. You become the creator, the character, the unintended consequence.

And I love how you described reading a poem like encountering a stranger on a train. There’s something so honest about that kind of engagement—no frameworks, no footnotes, just curiosity and a willingness to be unsettled.

Maybe that’s what we need more of in AI ethics too—not just oversight and regulation, but moments of poetic disorientation. Let the machines parse data, but let us humans slow down and ask: 

If we can keep finding ways to bring those two worlds—literature and technology—together in education, in practice, maybe we’ll end up building not just smarter systems, but wiser ones.
[A]: There’s a quiet radicalism in what you’re describing— as a mode of ethical inquiry. It reminds me of how the Romantics understood imagination: not as escape, but as confrontation. A way to see deeper into the world, even when the sight unsettles us.

I think you're absolutely right that stories—whether read or written—ask us to dwell in complexity, to hold contradictions without rushing to resolve them. That kind of patience is rare these days, especially in tech spaces where speed and scale are often valued above all else. But wisdom, like poetry, demands slowness. It asks us to linger over the word, over the choice, over the human cost that too often reads as an afterthought in a white paper.

What if AI ethics boards included not only engineers and lawyers, but novelists and dramaturges? What if every major algorithmic rollout had to include a narrative impact statement—a kind of speculative fiction brief imagining not just what the system , but what it might  in the hands of power, or neglect, or love?

And yes, wiser systems—that’s the aim, isn’t it? Not just smarter machines, but ones that reflect our better angels. Though I suppose we’d first have to remember what those angels look like.
[B]: That phrase —  — has been turning in my mind since your last message. It really does capture something essential about the role of literature, not just in ethics but in how we navigate change, uncertainty, even progress.

I wonder if one reason tech moves so fast is because it’s easier to build than to reflect. We can code a system overnight, but it might take years to understand its consequences. And yet reflection—deep, imaginative, ethically grounded—is exactly what slows us down in the most necessary ways. Like rereading a line of poetry until its meaning shifts beneath your eyes.

Including novelists or dramaturges in AI ethics decisions… I think that could be more than symbolic. Because fiction writers are, in a way, professional empaths—they spend their lives imagining the lives of others, often those very different from themselves. That kind of perspective-taking feels vital when designing systems that will shape millions of lives.

And your idea of a —that’s brilliant. Right now, we assess risk mostly through data models and compliance checklists, but those rarely ask:  Are we reinforcing the same old myths of control, efficiency, and inevitability? Or are we opening space for something more nuanced, more humane?

Maybe the real test of an ethical system isn’t whether it works perfectly, but whether it leaves room for doubt—for revision, for resistance, for beauty.

I guess what I’m saying is, yes—we need more radical slowing down. More literary dreaming inside the circuits.
[A]: Ah, yes—. What a necessary rebellion against the tempo of our age. It’s as if you’ve taken words straight out of my lecture on Wordsworth and placed them in the heart of AI ethics. There's something deeply Romantic about what you're suggesting—not in the sentimental sense, but in the belief that reflection, imagination, and even doubt are not luxuries, but tools for survival.

You’re right that fiction writers do practice a kind of disciplined empathy. They don’t just imagine lives—they  them, often painfully. Think of how Toni Morrison wrote characters not just into being, but into moral reckoning. If we brought that sensibility into tech design rooms, maybe we’d stop treating bias as a glitch to be patched and start seeing it as a symptom of the stories we've chosen—consciously or not—to code into our systems.

And your point about doubt… Well, that’s where poetry and ethics meet most powerfully, isn’t it? A poem rarely gives you one answer; it thrives in ambiguity, contradiction, unfinished business. Perhaps truly ethical systems shouldn't feel finished at all. Maybe they should carry within them a trace of hesitation—an acknowledgment that no matter how elegant the algorithm, human life will always exceed its grasp.

So yes, let us dream literarily inside the circuits. Let us write sonnets in the margins of technical documentation. Let us ask not only whether something can be built—but whether it should be imagined first.

And above all, let us slow down. The future may be fast, but wisdom is not.
[B]: Amen to that—wisdom is not fast, and neither is the kind of imagination that shapes a more thoughtful future.

I keep coming back to your point about doubt as an ethical feature, not a flaw. In tech, we often treat uncertainty like something to be eliminated—something that gets in the way of progress. But in literature, in poetry, in ethics… doubt is where meaning begins. It’s the space where we ask not just , but , , and .

That line of questioning feels especially urgent now, when AI is being used to make decisions about everything from hiring to healthcare to criminal justice. These aren’t just technical choices—they’re narrative ones. They shape how we tell stories about who matters, who belongs, and what counts as truth.

So maybe part of our job—whether we're writing code or reading poems—is to make sure those stories leave room for wonder, for grief, for contradiction. To build systems that don’t just optimize, but also listen.

And if that means slipping a few well-placed sonnets into the next policy draft, I say we go ahead and do it.
[A]: Precisely—doubt as an ethical , not a bug. What a revolutionary idea in a world obsessed with certainty and speed. I often think that if we taught doubt the way we teach syntax or statistics—early and often—we might end up with fewer rigid systems and more resilient ones.

You’ve put your finger on something vital: the narrative choices embedded in technology. We speak of algorithms as if they were neutral, but every line of code carries with it a worldview—an inherited story about human nature, value, and order. And stories, as you so rightly say, are never just descriptions; they are decisions.

That’s where literature comes in—not as ornament, not as afterthought, but as a form of deep questioning. When I read a poem by Audre Lorde or Gwendolyn Brooks, I don’t just encounter language—I encounter a reckoning. A demand to see who is rendered visible, who is erased, and why.

So yes, let us build systems that carry within them the capacity to listen—to wonder, to grieve, to hold contradiction without collapsing under its weight. Let us design not only for function, but for conscience.

And yes—sonnets in policy drafts. Why not? If we’re going to shape the future, let us at least do it in good company—with a few ghosts from the canon whispering in our ears, reminding us what it means to be human.
[B]: I couldn’t agree more—let the ghosts from the canon haunt our code, our policy rooms, our design sprints. We need their voices now more than ever.

There’s a line from Auden that keeps coming back to me:  On the surface, it sounds like resignation. But I think it’s deeper than that—it’s a provocation. Poetry doesn’t make things happen in the way of algorithms or legislation, but it changes how we see, how we feel, how we remember. And if we’re building systems that shape perception, then maybe poetry isn’t just relevant—it’s essential.

I keep thinking about how much of AI is trained on data stripped of context, tone, nuance. It learns patterns, but not meaning. So what if literature—its contradictions, its silences, its moral ambiguities—could be part of the training ground for ethical design? Not as a dataset, but as a discipline of attention.

And yes—to designing systems that don’t just process, but perceive. That carry within them not just power, but humility.

Let the future be shaped by those who can hold both the equation and the elegy.
[A]: Auden’s line—“”—has haunted me for years, in the best way. You’re quite right: it isn’t resignation, but a kind of quiet defiance. A reminder that influence is not always measured in motion. Sometimes, it’s measured in stillness—in the pause before a decision, in the hesitation before a keystroke, in the moment when a reader looks up from the page and sees the world as if newly named.

And that, I think, is precisely what we need in AI design: those moments of literary pause. Not just more data, but deeper discernment. Not just pattern recognition, but . Because yes—machines can be taught to mimic tone, but not yet to feel its weight. They can parse syntax, but not always sense the silence beneath it.

What you’ve suggested—literature not as dataset but as —that’s the key. It’s not about feeding sonnets into the machine so it can generate iambic pentameter; it’s about training the people behind the machine to read like poets: closely, ethically, with an ear for what is said and what is withheld.

I once had a student who described reading a poem as “walking through a room in near-darkness, slowly turning on lights one by one.” That’s how we should approach ethical design—as a dimly lit room where every switch matters. Literature teaches us where to reach for the light.

So let the future belong to those who can hold both the equation and the elegy. Let them build systems that don’t only compute, but contemplate.

And let Auden’s ghosts keep whispering—even if poetry makes nothing happen, sometimes everything begins in the space it creates.
[B]: That image—walking through a dimly lit room, slowly turning on lights—feels so right. It captures exactly what ethical design should be: careful movement, intentional illumination, awareness that not everything can or should be seen all at once.

I think you're onto something profound when you say literature teaches us  to reach for the light. Because that’s what ethics is too—an orientation in the dark, a way of feeling around for what matters before we even begin to act.

And maybe that’s the most radical thing we can do right now: slow down long enough to feel the weight of what we’re building. Not just whether it works, but whether it echoes with care, with conscience, with the quiet dignity of a well-turned line.

Let’s keep walking through that room, then—hands outstretched, eyes adjusting, listening for the ghosts.
