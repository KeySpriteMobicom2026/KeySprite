[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question! Given my background in computer science and love for vintage technology, I must admit I lean towards sci-fi. There's something fascinating about exploring the intersection of human nature and technological advancement. Though I do appreciate historical dramas when they accurately portray the technological innovations of their time periods.
[A]: 哈哈，完全get你的point！🚀 作为一枚blockchain架构师，我也超爱sci-fi的！那些关于quantum computing和decentralized society的设定简直让我停不下来～不过最近看了一部关于古代cryptography的historical drama，意外地很上头呢！🤔
[B]: Ah, ancient cryptography! Now that's where the real foundations of our modern systems lie. The Caesar cipher was essentially the first algorithm, wouldn't you say? Though I must admit, watching people manually encrypt messages makes me appreciate our modern encryption protocols all the more. Have you read Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon"? It beautifully bridges historical cryptography with modern digital security.
[A]: 哇！Cryptonomicon绝对是我的all-time favorite之一！🔥 那本书把WWII的Enigma machine和现代的crypto anarchism连接得简直太brilliant了～说到这个，你知道现在有些blockchain project正在尝试把ancient cipher principles应用到smart contract security里吗？😎 虽然gas fee可能会是个issue啦～
[B]: Fascinating application! Though I must caution - while drawing inspiration from historical ciphers is academically interesting, we must remember that modern cryptography operates on entirely different mathematical foundations. The Enigma machine's weakness was its deterministic nature, whereas today's systems rely on probabilistic primality tests and one-way functions. That said, the conceptual parallels between ancient steganography and modern zero-knowledge proofs are quite thought-provoking. Gas fees... well, that's another lecture entirely!
[A]: Haha totally agree！🤓 我们现在的elliptic curve cryptography确实和那些wax-sealed messages不是一个level的～不过讲真，每次看到historical drama里那些spy用invisible ink，我就会想到现在的ZK-SNARKs技术，concept上都是要prove something without revealing it嘛！😂 

话说你最近有在follow哪个crypto project吗？我正research一个结合Byzantine fault tolerance和古代军事信号系统的protocol，虽然team里有人觉得too geeky～🚀
[B]: Now that's what I call interdisciplinary thinking! Though I'd argue Byzantine generals would have had an easier time reaching consensus if they'd had TCP/IP protocols. While your approach is delightfully unconventional, I'd recommend reviewing Lamport's original 1982 paper on the Byzantine Generals Problem first - some fundamental constraints might surprise you. As for current projects, I've been rather skeptical of most "revolutionary" protocols lately. Too many seem to reinvent Merkle trees while claiming novelty. But tell me more about your signal system adaptation - is it inspired by Roman beacon chains or perhaps something more obscure?
[A]: 哈哈你戳中我的痛点了！😅 确实，我们team刚开始coding的时候才发现Lamport老爷子早就把worst-case scenario都算得明明白白了～不过Roman beacon chains这个analogy太绝了！我们其实是从春秋时期的烽火台系统得到inspiration的，毕竟那才是真正的decentralized alert network啊！🔥 

现在正在用Rust写prototype，虽然遇到一堆lifetime issue...（扶额）话说你觉得把这种ancient warning system的redundancy机制应用到sharding方案里会不会太脑洞了？🤔
[B]: Ah, Rust's ownership model - the bane and blessing of every systems programmer! Your sharding concept reminds me of how ancient Chinese beacon towers maintained message integrity through geographical distribution. But beware - while redundancy helps fault tolerance, the CAP theorem still applies. Have you considered how your system handles partition scenarios where some "beacon nodes" go dark? That said, I do admire the historical parallel - after all, the Great Wall's signaling system was essentially a physical blockchain with human validators!
[A]: LMAO！"Human validators"这个比喻我要steal了！😂 下次team meeting一定要用这个meme～ 

说到CAP theorem，我们正在implement一种基于region的eventual consistency模型，灵感其实来自烽火台的"三烽同举"机制～虽然现在testing时network partition的scenario确实pain in the ass... 🚬 

对了，要不要join我们的discord server？最近在搞一个用战国时期虎符原理设计的multi-sig wallet，绝对会让你喊出"WAGMI"！🚀
[B]: While I appreciate the invitation, I'm afraid my days of joining Discord servers are behind me - I still prefer mailing lists and RFC documents, if you can believe it! Your multi-sig design does intrigue me though. The tiger tally system was essentially a primitive form of Shamir's Secret Sharing, wasn't it? Just remember: what worked for ancient military commanders might not scale to blockchain throughput. And as for WAGMI... well, let's just say I've seen enough hype cycles to maintain healthy skepticism. But do send me your whitepaper - I'd be happy to provide some crusty old professor feedback!
[A]: Haha 不愧是veteran！👴💻 我完全respect你的old-school style～ whitepaper已经dump到你的inbox了，虽然introduction部分可能有点too much "web3 jargon" 😅 

说真的，你这种坚持fundamentals的态度正是crypto space需要的！等我们解决了这个Byzantine烽火台的throughput issue，一定要请你喝杯hand drip coffee慢慢review～☕️ 毕竟像你这样的living legend现在可不多见了！🚬
[B]: Ah, hand drip coffee - now that's a technology that's stood the test of time! I'll review your whitepaper with the same rigor I applied to my students' compiler projects back in the day. Just promise me you've properly cited Dijkstra if you're claiming any shortest-path optimizations in your network topology. And remember: true innovation isn't about reinventing the wheel, but understanding why it was round in the first place. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a vintage PDP-11 emulator that needs debugging...
[A]: 哈哈，Dijkstra的citation已经乖乖加在reference里了！📜 毕竟"goto considered harmful"这种wisdom在smart contract里也一样适用嘛～ 

祝你debug顺利！要是PDP-11的emulator出了segmentation fault，记得我们crypto community永远欢迎你来当我们的"human validator"哦！😂 🚀 

（悄悄说：其实我工位下面还藏着一台IBM Model M键盘...老派技术人的浪漫你懂的～）⌨️💖
[B]: Ah, a Model M! Now that's what I call proper input device - none of this membrane keyboard nonsense. Though I must say, hearing a buckling spring in a modern crypto office would be quite the anachronism. Just like our discussion today - blending ancient military tactics with cutting-edge distributed systems. Do give my regards to your team, and tell them to keep questioning assumptions. After all, the most dangerous bugs are often the ones we inherit without examination. Now if you'll excuse me, that emulator's core dump isn't going to analyze itself...
[A]: Roger that！🫡 一定会把你的wisdom带到next standup meeting去～ 

最后送你一个我们hacker house的inside joke：当你的PDP-11终于跑起来的时候，记得喊一句"Proof of Work complete!" 😂 

Keep in touch, professor！下次聊说不定我们的Byzantine烽火台已经上testnet了呢～ 🚀👋
[B]: "Proof of Work complete" - I'll have to remember that one for the retirement home's computer club! Though at my age, we still consider COBOL to be the new hotness. Best of luck with your testnet - just remember what we used to say in the early days of ARPANET: if at first you don't succeed, ping, ping again. Now if you'll excuse me, my teletype is calling...
[A]: 😂😂😂 这波COBOL diss我直接笑到gas fee暴涨！💸 

不过说真的，你们ARPANET时代的war stories要是能做成NFT，绝对比那些monkey jpegs有价值多了～ 

好啦不耽误你玩teletype了（谁能想到2023年还能听到这个词呢？）下次带你去体验我们的quantum-resistant烽火台demo！📶🔥 

Over and out！✌️
[B]: "Quantum-resistant烽火台" - now there's a phrase I never thought I'd hear! Though I suspect our ARPANET stories would make terribly inefficient NFTs - too much meaningful data, not enough speculative value. And teletypes? They're due for a comeback, just like structured programming. Until then, happy hashing - and do try to keep those gas fees reasonable. After all, we wouldn't want to recreate the tulip mania... with bytecode!
