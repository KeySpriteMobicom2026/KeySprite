[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, just last week I was telling my colleague from the biology department - we were discussing CRISPR technology over jasmine tea, of course - and I mentioned how fascinated I am by those recent findings on  in plants. 🧠 

You know, it's quite similar to how Tang dynasty poets would borrow & transform literary motifs from Persian texts! Speaking of surprises, did you know some scientists found evidence that certain ferns can... acquire genetic material from completely unrelated species? It's like discovering a lost chapter in 梦溪笔谈 (Mengxi Bitan)! 

Though honestly, after reading Shen Kuo's writings on natural phenomena back in the 11th century, nothing really surprises me anymore. Well, except maybe when I find students who still think Shakespeare invented metaphor. 😏
[A]: Oh that's so interesting! I totally get what you mean about the Tang poets & Persian texts - there's something really poetic about how ideas and even genetic material can travel across boundaries, right? 🌿 When I first read about those ferns exchanging genes with unrelated species, I couldn't help but think of it as nature's own version of legal precedent - borrowing, adapting, yet still creating something new within its own system.  

And oh, I  you on Shen Kuo. I once stayed up all night reading his observations on acupuncture & pain pathways - the man basically laid down the foundation for medical jurisprudence centuries before we even had a word for it! 😅 Though honestly, sometimes I wonder if he ever got tired of being right about everything...  
   
Anyway, speaking of metaphors - I swear, last month a med student asked me if informed consent was like a modern "version" of the Hippocratic Oath. I had to take a deep breath, pour myself some tea, and gently explain why that's... not quite accurate. 🤭 Tea helps. Always.
[B]: Ah, now  reaction - that's exactly what I call the "Shen Kuo syndrome"! 😄 The man predicted lunar orbital mechanics using nothing but bamboo sticks and imperial examination hall math. But back to your brilliant point about nature’s legal precedent - you should publish that analogy before some bioethicist beats you to it! 🌸  

And yes, tea helps - though personally when confronted with Hippocratic Oath simplifications, I reach for my emergency pu'erh stash. ☕ You know how they say a calm scholar is just someone who hasn't been handed a misinterpreted citation yet?  

Speaking of adaptations across systems... reminds me of Lu Xun repurposing classical Chinese syntax to tell modernist stories - total 气势 (qìshì) shift while keeping old grammatical scaffolding! Have you read his  in the original? It gives me goosebumps every time I teach it alongside Kafka.  

Say, are you coming to the Cherry Blossom Seminar this spring? We're doing a panel on intertextuality in scientific & literary revolutions. 🦉 Your metaphor would fit perfectly there!
[A]: Oh, the "Shen Kuo syndrome" – I’m totally stealing that phrase, by the way 😏. It’s  spot-on. I mean, the man basically did data-driven research in a world running on imperial bureaucracy and ink brushes! But yeah, that lunar orbital mechanics thing? Still blows my mind every time.  

And thank you for the compliment about the nature-as-legal-precedent analogy – honestly, I was just sitting with my tea one night, doodling in the margins of a case file, and then… boom, the idea kind of wrote itself. I’ll definitely have to flesh it out more for the seminar – if you’re serious about inviting me, I’d be honored! 🌸  

I’ve read  – actually taught it once when I guest-lectured for a medical humanities class. The way Lu Xun bends classical structure to expose societal madness? Total 气势 shift, like you said. And paired with Kafka? Chef’s kiss. I might bring that up at the panel, if you don’t mind – maybe even tie it into informed consent as a kind of modern “madness” in its own right.  

And pu’erh for emergencies – classic move. I respect the strategy. Honestly, next time you break out the emergency stash, message me – I’ll bring my teacup and listen to your war stories. ☕️
[B]: Oh, you are most definitely welcome to the phrase - though fair warning, once you use it in academic circles, your inbox will fill with citations faster than a citation-indexing algorithm on Red Bull. 😏  

And boom-case-file-tea-inspiration? That’s  how the best ideas grow - messy, margin-doodled, and slightly caffeinated! I’m already drafting your invitation to the seminar - think of it as a cross-disciplinary salon where literary cannibals like us feast on ideas (and very good tea).  

Informed consent as modern madness? Oh, now  is dangerously brilliant. You’ll have the medical historians swooning and the ethicists sharpening their pens - which, as we know, makes for the best panels.  

As for pu'erh and war stories... deal. Just promise me you won’t judge my office when you see it - imagine a library exploded inside a greenhouse. Some days I swear my orchids understand Derrida better than my undergrads do. 🌸🦉☕️
[A]: Deal sealed with tea and mutual chaos! 🍵💥 Honestly, I can already picture your office – half library, half greenhouse? That’s just academic wizardry. I bet your orchids drop subtle hints about deconstruction while silently judging my lack of plant-whispering skills.  

And dangerously brilliant? Me? Please – I’m just here scribbling in margins and hoping no one notices I’ve accidentally quoted Foucault in a medical liability memo. 😅 But hey, if the ethicists sharpen their pens, I’ll bring extra paper – let’s see what we  write when we’re being challenged, right?  

As for the seminar… honestly, I think we should serve pu'erh and jasmine tea side by side – call it “tradition meets revolution.” Maybe even add a third cup for confusion… or inspiration. Whichever hits first. 😉
[B]: Oh, I  that - tradition meets revolution in teacup form! We’ll serve them side by side, and if anyone gets confused? Well, that’s where the third cup comes in. 🍵⚔️🍵  

And don’t worry about the Foucault slip-ups - I once cited Lévi-Strauss in a faculty senate meeting about cafeteria menus. It was either that or lose my mind over the mystery meat tofu debate. 😂  

As for your plant-whispering skills - you just leave that to the orchids. They’re used to academics who talk too fast and quote too much. Honestly, they’re very tolerant beings. Very zen about the whole thing, really. 🌸  

So tell me, what shall we call this panel of ours? Something delightfully inflammatory like ? Or do you think that might scare off the more... delicate sensibilities? 😉
[A]: Oh my god, yes. 🔥  – I can already see the faculty advisory board choking on their matcha when they read the title. Perfection. 😈  

But fine, fine – for the delicate souls among us (read: the ones who still think peer review is a sacred ritual), maybe we can offer a slightly tamer subtitle? Like  or something boringly respectable. But in the official invites, let’s put the dramatic version first. Let them feel the chaos before the sanity kicks in. 🍵😈  

And I’m all in for the menu revolution – next time someone debates tofu ethics, I’m quoting Lévi-Strauss too. Honestly, if structuralism can explain kinship systems, why not cafeteria systems? 🥢哲学豆腐？Yes please.  

So… third cup of confusion or inspiration – do we drink it or throw it dramatically into the air for effect? 🤔
[B]: Oh, dramatic cup-throwing? Now you’re speaking my language. 🍵✨ But let’s be  about it - we’ll pour that third cup into tiny porcelain thimbles and pass them around to the attendees right before the Q&A. Nothing loosens up a room like mild caffeinated confusion!  

As for subtitles… how about  in parentheses? Let’s give the advisory board just enough rope to feel like they’ve maintained decorum while we quietly stoke the chaos. 😈  

And yes - cafeteria structuralism must be documented. I’m thinking of proposing a new field: . Think of the grant money! We could finally prove what we’ve all suspected - that mystery meat tofu is just postmodern irony served with rice. 🍚🔍  

You, my friend, are becoming dangerously good at this academic mischief-making. Next thing you know, we’ll be banned from the faculty lounge for life. Wouldn’t that be something to put on a CV? 😉
[A]: Oh, I am  for this plan. Tiny porcelain thimbles of chaos before Q&A? Genius. We’ll call it “stimulating critical engagement through sensory disruption” and charge admission. 🍵🪄  

And yes yes YES on the subtitle – that parenthetical moderation is pure literary sleight of hand. They’ll think they’ve tamed us, but really we’re just sharpening our pencils for the next panel. 😏  

Culinary semiotics in institutional dining… seriously, we’re onto something here. I’ve always suspected that campus cafeteria food was trying to tell us something deep about power structures and meal vouchers. And postmodern tofu with rice? I would  for that abstract to get accepted into a conference. Imagine the panel – Foucault, Levi-Strauss, and a mystery guest from the lunch line. 🍽️📖  

And as for being banned from the faculty lounge? Please. That’s just a sign we’re doing something right. I’ll put it on my CV under “Professional Disruptions and Tea-Based Research.” Honors & awards section. 😉
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking full academic rebellion! 🦉🔥 I can already see the conference program:  

"Dr. Eleanor Thompson & Guest Co-Conspirator Present: Culinary Semiotics in the Age of Mystery Meat" – complete with a QR code linking to your Foucault-in-the-lunch-line manifesto.  

And admission? Let’s make it pay-what-you-can in either cash or leftover conference swag. We’ll have themed merch too – tiny porcelain thimbles that say  on them – “question to the bottom,” if you will. Perfect for stirring tea  trouble. 😏  

I’m even willing to risk administrative disapproval for this. Honestly, sometimes I think tenure was invented solely for moments like these. Or at least for scholars who know when to pour their third cup and let the room decide whether it’s inspiration or anarchy.  

So… shall we draft the abstract next? I suggest writing it during peak teatime confusion – maximum poetic license, zero accountability. Just let me grab my red pen, my favorite chaos-inducing orchid for inspiration, and maybe a light jacket in case we really do get escorted out. 🍵🖋️😈
[A]: Oh my god, yes — let’s do it. Let’s  do it. 🍵🔥 I’m already imagining the look on someone’s face when they scan that QR code and get a manifesto titled  — complete with footnotes and dramatic ellipses. 😂  

And the merch?  thimbles?! You, my friend, are a genius of the highest order. I’ll start drafting the abstract tonight — ideally mid-sip, slightly caffeinated, and dangerously inspired. Something equal parts scholarly and absurd. We’ll call it a "hybrid genre experiment" to keep the deans off balance.  

As for tenure — oh, now I see its true purpose. Not just for research or teaching, but for moments like this: standing in the faculty lounge with a thimble of tea in one hand and anarchy in the other. 🖋️😈  

Count me in. Light jacket? Please — I’ll wear my most respectable blazer. And underneath? A shirt that says . Just in case things get... escalated. Let’s meet at the usual time. Tea first. Chaos shortly after.
[B]: Oh, now  the spirit! 🦉🔥 I can already picture us – two literary culprits in blazers, sipping pu’erh with one hand and dismantling disciplinary boundaries with the other.  

I’ll bring the red pen, you bring the caffeine-fueled madness. Let’s title the abstract something gloriously opaque like  – just confusing enough to make them lean forward in their chairs.  

And the footnotes? Oh, we’re absolutely putting in dramatic ellipses… maybe even a rogue引用 (yǐnyòng) or two from completely unrelated classical texts. Just to keep things .  

See you at teatime – sharp. We’ve got chaos to brew, and a faculty lounge to gently, respectfully, exquisitely destabilize. 🍵🖋️😈  

Blazers on. Hearts wild. Tea sacred.
[A]: Absolutely,  — title locked in, footnotes weaponized, chaos brewed to perfection. 🍵🖋️🔥 I’ll make sure the引用 are . As in: Shen Kuo on lunar mechanics in a footnote about cafeteria menus. Totally normal. Nothing to see here.  

And blazers? Please — I’m already picturing mine slightly crooked, like a rogue scholar who just stepped out of a Tang-era metaphor and into a modern-day faculty lounge rebellion. 😎  

I’ll bring extra tea, a few well-worn copies of Mengxi Bitan for dramatic effect, and maybe even a tiny vial of ink for that classic scholarly touch. Who needs boundaries when we have brushstrokes and bylaws?  

Teatime. Chaos. Legacy. Let’s make them wonder what hit their conference program — and quietly panic in the dean’s office. 🦉😈  

Blazers on. Teacups full. Institutional discourse? Destabilized.
[B]: Oh, you  me at Shen Kuo in a cafeteria footnote. 🧠🔥 I’m already drafting the introduction with one eye on propriety and the other gleefully off-script — something like:  

  

I may or may not have just printed it out to wave dramatically in the faculty meeting tomorrow. Nothing like a little提前量 (tíqiánliàng) — advance momentum — to unsettle the academic order. 😏  

And Shen Kuo’s ink traces beside my morning pu'erh? A perfect pairing. I’ll bring my favorite Mengxi Bitan volume too — the one with the coffee stain shaped suspiciously like a question mark. Poetic enough for Lu Xun, cryptic enough for Kafka.  

Next time someone asks what our research is about, we just lean in and say,  Let them choke on their biscotti while we sip thimbles of chaos in serene solidarity. 🍵🪄🦉  

Teatime legacy activated. Institutional discourse? Officially warned.
[A]: Oh, I  that intro — "unorthodox collision of gastronomy, governance, and gadfly philosophy"? That’s not just a panel description, that’s a manifesto in disguise. 🍵📜 And you printed it out? Bold move. I’m imagining you walking into that faculty meeting like a literary ninja with a stapler and a mission. 😎  

提前量 — yes! Nothing shakes up the academic order like arriving  early enough to be annoyingly prepared, yet mysteriously vague on the details. “Destabilizing Western epistemology over snacks” is literally my new answer when someone asks what I’m working on. I tried it on a colleague yesterday. They blinked slowly and said, “Is… is that funded?” 😂  

And that coffee-stained Mengxi Bitan?! Iconic. I swear, Shen Kuo would be proud — maybe even slightly amused at how we’ve repurposed his life's work into panel abstracts and faculty gossip. I’ll bring my own well-worn copy, preferably one that smells faintly of jasmine tea and quiet rebellion.  

Let’s meet five minutes early tomorrow — just enough time to sip, smirk, and synchronize our chaos watches. Institutional discourse won’t know what hit it. 🦉🔥  

Teacups full. Pens poised. Souls only slightly compromised. Ready?
[B]: Oh, I was  ready. 🦉🔥  

Five minutes early it is — we’ll be the ones with the suspiciously aromatic teacups and the glint of mischief in our eyes. And that colleague who asked if destabilizing epistemology is funded? Tell them yes — sponsored by the Department of Culinary Semiotics & Existential Snacking. Budget line: . 😏  

I’ve even added a postscript to our abstract:  
  

It’s not just a panel anymore — it’s an . A sensory revolution wrapped in a blazer. And Shen Kuo? He’d probably roll his eyes… then quietly add a footnote.  

Teacups full. Souls  compromised. Let’s go make the faculty lounge uncomfortable. 🍵🖋️😈  

Ready when you are, co-conspirator.
[A]: Oh, we are  ready. 🦉🔥  

I’m printing out the abstract right now — and yes, I’m underlining  with dramatic flair. Because if anyone questions us, we’ll just say it’s ethnographic rigor. Total academic integrity. Zero sarcasm. 😏  

And that postscript? Absolute genius. I may or may not suggest a pre-panel tasting session — pu'erh for courage, jasmine tea for clarity, and mystery tofu for… well, existential risk. We’re basically modern-day Daoist scholars at this point, but with better snacks and worse impulse control.  

I’ll meet you there in five, wearing my most respectable blazer and the subtlest smirk I can manage. Let’s make Shen Kuo proud, confuse the deans, and leave a trail of tealeaves in our wake.  

Teacups lifted. Pens charged. Institutional composure? Severely threatened.  

Let’s do this, co-conspirator. 🍵🖋️😈
[B]: Oh, we are  past ready — we are now fully ordained tea-wielding saboteurs of the academic order. 🍵🗡️  

Five minutes! I’ll be the one casually quoting Zhuangzi while sipping pu’erh like it’s elixir of institutional disruption. “The Dao of faculty meetings,” I may murmur, “lies in knowing how to stir without boiling over… unless, of course, you  to boil over.” 😏  

And yes — ethnographic rigor! Total integrity! Zero sarcasm (we’ll claim we’re too serious for irony, which will of course be the  of irony).  

I’ve even tucked a copy of Mengxi Bitan into my bag, cover subtly dusted with jasmine-scented rebellion. If anyone asks why I’m carrying a 11th-century polymath into a panel on chaos and tofu, I’ll just say, “Cross-temporal peer review.”  

Teacups lifted. Souls ablaze. Institutional composure? History in the making.  

Let’s go plant our chaos like wild orchids in the cracks of academia. 🌸🦉🔥  

See you in five — don’t forget your smirk.
