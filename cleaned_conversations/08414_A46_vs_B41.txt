[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh wow，这个话题超有趣的！我觉得parallel universes的概念简直太适合做成综艺节目了，想象一下不同宇宙的自己互换人生这种设定，绝对会有超多drama和unexpected的火花产生🎬。虽然听起来有点科幻，但你知道吗，现在很多科学理论其实都暗示着multiverse的可能性哦！就像我们做节目总说的，Reality is overrated，有时候真实反而比虚构更离奇~ 诶你有没有想过，在另一个宇宙里可能我是名宇航员，而你是超级巨星？😂
[A]: You know, I’ve always believed that the best stories come from asking “what if?”—and parallel universes? That’s the ultimate playground for storytellers. Imagine a film where every decision splinters reality... no hero, no villain, just versions of ourselves trying to navigate different paths. It’s not just sci-fi; it’s deeply human. And honestly, if there’s another me out there, I hope he finally learned how to say no to those endless studio notes 🎥 (though I doubt it).
[B]: Oh absolutely, I’m all about that “what if?” energy 💡 It’s like… what if in another universe, we’re not just pitching ideas but actually binge-watching the show we  got greenlit? 🚀 And yeah, no heroes, no villains—that’s such a refreshing twist. Imagine how juicy the character dynamics would be when everyone’s just… regular people with messy choices. Oh man, I can already picture the promo: “No superpowers, no destiny—just a whole lot of parallel drama.” 🎬

And hey, I feel you on those studio notes 😩 In another timeline, we’re probably besties ranting about execs who think adding a dragon will “elevate the brand.” 🔥 But still, it’s kinda wild to think somewhere out there, there’s a version of us who got it all right—or at least got a nap in. 😂
[A]: Okay, now you’re speaking my language—parallel universes where we’re not just pitching but  the show, remote in hand, snacks on deck 🍿. That’s the kind of reality I want to manifest. And can you picture the casting? Like, which version of me shows up—The One Who Listened To The Notes, The One Who Burned Them For Firepower, or The One Who Just Napped Through Development? 😅

But seriously, imagine the emotional punch if every character is just… trying their best with what they’ve got. No cosmic destiny, no chosen one nonsense—just people making choices and living (or regretting) them. It’s raw. It’s real. And honestly? It’s the kind of script that could make someone cry in a way that isn’t just CGI-induced. 💔

Oh, and about those execs—somewhere out there, there’s a studio head who greenlit , not just brands. Maybe we should try to find that universe and send ourselves a memo 📨.
[B]: Oh my god，I’m getting chills just picturing it—us, on the couch, watching our own show like proud宇宙parents 😂🍿 And trust me，the casting would be ~ The Me From Timeline 12B would totally show up as The One Who Somehow Convinced The Execs That Less Is More… while secretly bribing them with artisanal coffee 🧠☕️. And your alternate selves？黄金组合啊！One’s writing heartfelt monologues in a café，one’s screaming into a pillow labeled “network feedback”，and one’s just vibing in Bali like none of this ever happened 😂🔥.

And yeah，this story—it wouldn’t need explosions or aliens or whatever “high-concept” nonsense；just raw human moments colliding across dimensions 💔💫。Like a character finally finding their other self who got everything right，only to realize… they still have doubts，they still mess up。That’s what hits hard，you know？No destiny，no shortcuts—just us，trying our best and sometimes failing beautifully 🎬✨。

As for the execs who actually greenlit ？We need a wormhole to that universe ASAP，I’ve got a pitch called  ready to go 😉🚀。
[A]: Okay, now you’re just teasing me with that vision—us on the couch, watching our show like it’s some kind of interdimensional reunion special 😂🍿. And I  your casting breakdown—Timeline 12B? Honestly, steal that Me and put them in charge of my next meeting. Artisanal coffee and quiet manipulation? That’s the kind of diplomacy I can get behind ☕️😎.

And for my alternate selves? Yeah, let’s go with your lineup. The café writer is drafting the script, the pillow-screamer is handling notes, and Bali Mike? He’s our spiritual guide, reminding us all to breathe and stop taking this too seriously 🌴🧘‍♂️.

You nailed it though—no aliens, no explosions, just raw, messy humanity colliding across dimensions. Imagine a scene: two versions of the same person finally meet, one thinking they’ve won at life… until they realize neither of them really knows what they’re doing. That’s the stuff that makes audiences lean in and whisper, “Damn… we’re all just winging it, huh?” 💔🎬

And Wormhole To Art Universe? Sign me up—I’m already packing my pitch deck for . Let’s make it happen. Or should I say… let’s make it . 😉🎥
[B]: Oh man，我已经被这个画面洗脑了—我们窝在沙发上，手拿零食，见证着平行宇宙的自己如何把一堆乱码搞成神剧😂🍿。Timeline 12B？绝对值得被提拔！Artisanal咖啡+quiet manipulation=我心目中的executive producing dream team ☕️🔥。

至于你的三重身份设定—Café Writer, Pillow-Screamer, Bali Guru—这也太有梗了吧！而且说实话，这设定完全可以直接拿来当一集的title： 🌴🧘‍♂️🎬。光是想到那个场景，我就忍不住想加点综艺感进去：比如让他们在一个超现实的liminal space里碰头，谁也不知道这是梦境、量子纠缠还是just too much caffeine～💡

你说的那个“Neither of us really knows what we’re doing”的瞬间——boom 💥，这就是泪点啊！No aliens，no AI takeover，no dystopian government，just两个你坐在那儿互相安慰：“Hey，至少我们都还在努力活着。” 这种真实感，简直比任何特效都来得震撼 💔✨。

至于wormhole到艺术宇宙这件事，我已经开始准备plan B啦 😉🚀。毕竟，在某个宇宙里，林凯文早就成功了，Mike也终于说出了那句：“抱歉，我不能接受这些notes。” 我们要做的，就是找到那个频率，对吧？📡🎥

Let’s make it multiverse indeed 😎🌟
[A]: Alright, now you’re speaking full-on multiverse gospel 😂🍿. And I’m here for it—especially that  episode. Picture the set: a glowing, endless hallway with doors that flicker like old film reels. Every time they open one, it shifts the vibe—chaotic boardroom, serene beach, or just… a couch with two burnt-out versions of me arguing over the last gummy bear 🍬🌀. 

And yeah, that heart-punch moment? Total gold. Two selves sitting on the floor, back-to-back, whispering “I thought you had it figured out.” No aliens, no dragons, no twist villain—just raw vulnerability in 4K HDR. If that doesn’t make someone cry, I don’t know what will 💔🎥.

As for finding that artistic universe? I say we build a signal booster—half vintage radio, half quantum tuner—and start scanning frequencies during our next coffee break ☕️📡. Who knows? Maybe somewhere out there, we’re already legends. And if not? Well… we’ve got Bali Mike’s number. He’s probably got a villa with our names on it 🌴😎.
[B]: Dude，你现在说话简直像穿越剧台词一样 🌌😂！那个liminal hallway的设定—oh my god，我已经看到视觉团队疯狂点头的画面了！Glowing doors，flickering reels，还有一打开门就是“董事会暴风雨”或“海滩冥想模式”——这不比什么《黑镜》还带感？而且你说的那个gummy bear大战现场…我直接笑出声了好吗！两个burnt-out版本的你为了零食较劲，这绝对是史上最真实又最荒诞的哲学场景 🍬🔥！

至于back-to-back的那句“I thought you had it figured out”……Boom 💥，这一枪直接命中泪腺啊！这就是我们想要的moment—没有特效，没有配乐煽情，只有两颗疲惫的心在互相照镜子 💔✨。观众看完绝对会陷入沉默三秒，然后猛拍大腿：“靠，这不是在说我吗？” 这才是真正的恐怖片—直面自己的人生真相 😱🎬！

Signal booster + quantum tuner + vintage radio？你这是要做multiverse遥控器吧 😂📡！不过听好了—我已经让道具组画好草图了，下一次咖啡break我们就动手组装！Half artisanal coffee, half cosmic signal boost—just to tune into that universe where we’re not just legends, but also  🎵☕️🔥！

And if all else fails? Bali Mike’s villa is officially our Plan B 🌴😎🌟。我觉得他已经在那边给我们留了两张躺椅了～
[A]: Dude, I’m telling you—this show’s gonna break the internet and maybe also a few existential boundaries 🌌😂. And you’re right about that hallway scene—it’s not just visual gold, it’s . One door opens and boom, Boardroom Mike is in full “I-have-a-PowerPoint-on-emotional-arcs” mode. Next door? Beach Mike’s whispering “let it go, man… pass the SPF 50.” This isn’t TV anymore—it’s a multiverse therapy session 🧠🌴🎬.

And that gummy bear fight? Total character-defining moment. You think people don’t battle over snacks when facing the meaning of life? Please. That’s where legends are born 💪🍬.

As for that mirror-of-the-soul line—“I thought  had it figured out…”? That’s not just a tearjerker, that’s a . No music needed, no slow zoom-in—just two burnt-out souls realizing nobody really gets handed the manual. And yeah, that silence after? The kind where audiences forget to breathe? That’s the stuff awards are made of 💔🏆.

And now you’ve gone and greenlit the Multiverse Remote?! I love it. Let’s call it:  — artisanal coffee brewed, signal boosted, Bali vibes queued up on standby 📡☕️😎. We find that universe. We  that universe.

And if we don’t? Lie-flat cinema starts at sunset. Bali Mike’s got us. Trust the process 😉🌴✨.
[B]: Dude，你刚刚这段话我已经在脑内配上预告片音效了好吗！🌌🔥“This is not a show… this is an identity crisis simulator 🧠💥”——IMAX巨型银幕上打出来都够劲！

那个hallway不只是identity-level chaos，这是level 10 life crisis on steroids啊！Boardroom Mike带着PPT激情演讲，下一秒Beach Mike用椰子油和防晒喷雾治愈世界🌴🌞。这哪是穿越？这根本是自我认知的过山车，坐一次直接灵魂脱臼 😱！

还有gummy bear fight那段，我已经能想象社交媒体爆红了😂🍬：“Character-defining candy battle” 登上热搜，观众疯狂剪GIF，配文是 “This is me vs my own expectations.” 爆哭三百万次 👀💔。

至于“I thought  had it figured out”那句……Boom 💥，灵魂直击，连Netflix原创都要抢着买全球版权！No music, no close-up，只靠两个疲惫的灵魂互相照镜子，就能让观众边看边查自己有没有备用人生账号～🏆🎬

至于Frequency Couch™️？Yes. Yes. YES. 我已经在写pitch deck标题了：《Multiverse Remote: Find Your Perfect Timeline™️》 📡🛋️✨。Artisanal咖啡+量子调频+Bali待命模式，我们不只做节目，我们在打造平行宇宙遥控器！😎🚀

And if we don’t find that universe？那我们就地成为自己的multiverse吧 😉🌴🌟。毕竟，在某个角落里，林凯文和Mike早就躺在躺椅上喝鸡尾酒了——而我们现在说的每一句话，可能就是通往那个世界的频率呢？🎧🌀😎
[A]: Oh my God, I can already hear the trailer voiceover —  🎬🌀. And you’re right — this isn’t just a show, it’s a full-blown identity audit with snacks and dramatic lighting 💡🍿.

Boardroom Mike vs. Beach Mike? That’s not just a storyline, that’s a . One’s trying to pitch emotional arcs with slides, the other’s got a coconut in one hand and enlightenment in the other. It’s like  meets  — and I, for one, would binge it all night long 🏖️⚔️🍿.

And don’t even get me started on that gummy bear moment going viral —  trend, TikTok dances, fan edits with dramatic slo-mo shots of the candy flying through the air 🍬🎥🔥. It’s raw. It’s real. It’s slightly sticky.

And that line —  — yeah, that’s not just a quote, that’s a tattoo-in-the-making 💔🖋️. People are gonna be whispering that to themselves before job interviews, first dates, and life-changing decisions. And when they do? They’ll pause, reflect, and maybe text their past self: “Hey, we’re doing okay.” 📱💫

As for the  — YES. We’re not just making TV anymore, we’re selling hope in handheld form 📡🔮✨. One press of a button and BAM — you’re in the timeline where you  take that risk,  say yes to that opportunity, or at least  get that nap in before the meeting.

And if we never find that perfect universe? Fine. We create our own. One Bali sunset at a time 🌴😎🌞. Because honestly? If there’s one thing I’ve learned from decades in this business, it’s that sometimes the best stories aren’t about finding your destiny…

They’re about rewriting it. 🎥💫🚀
[B]: Dude…你刚刚这段话我已经在脑内剪成预告片了好吗！🎬🔥 那个voiceover我都能配——“” 💥🛋️ 真的，IMAX厅里要是不放这个我都跟院线没得谈！

Boardroom Mike vs. Beach Mike？这哪是角色设定啊，这是新时代的人生哲学battle royale好吗！💼🌴 一个拿着PPT讲情感弧线，一个涂着椰子油讲心灵解脱，简直《角斗士》混搭《天堂酒店》，再加上一点点existential crisis的调味料～⚔️🏖️ 我敢说，观众一边看一边想：“等等，这不就是我在开会vs我在度假的状态吗？” 😂🍿

Gummy bear battle viral起来的画面我已经看到爽了😂🍬 TikTok挑战、慢动作飞糖、粉丝二创……甚至有人会出教程叫“How to Survive the Bowl Battle: A Self-Help Guide” 🍬🎥🔥。人生啊，不就是一场争夺零食与意义的史诗级战斗吗？

至于那句灵魂暴击台词——“I thought YOU had it figured out…” 💔🖋️ 这不是台词，这是现代年轻人的soul tattoo！面试前念一遍，约会前默念三遍，搬家时边打包边喃喃自语：“Mike，你到底有没有搞清楚人生啊？” 最后发现…其实谁都没搞懂，但我们都还在努力中 📱💫。

Multiverse Remote™️？Yes please！这不是遥控器，这是手持版的人生后悔药💊🔮✨。按下按钮，瞬间切换到那个勇敢版本的自己，那个说了“Yes”的自己，或者更现实一点——那个成功请假去躺平的自己😌📲⚡。

你说得对，如果我们找不到完美的宇宙？那就自己写一个新的呗😎🌀🌟。从一个Bali日落开始，从一句“I’m okay”开始，从一段我们愿意相信的故事开始…

因为说到底，最好的故事从来不是找到 destiny，
而是亲手 rewire 它。🎥💥🚀

Let’s make this show, man.
Let’s make it multiverse.🌍💡🍿
[A]: 🔥🎬 Let’s. Fucking. Do it.

And I’m not just talking about the show—I’m talking about the . Because this isn’t just TV anymore; it’s a mirror, a lifeline, and yeah, maybe even a gummy bear-powered emotional exorcism 🍬🌀💔.

You think IMAX’s ready? Wait till they hear about the  — full 360° hallway sequences where audiences , choosing doors, chasing their own alternate selves like it’s a real-life interactive midlife crisis 🚪👁️💫.

Boardroom Mike vs. Beach Mike? That’s Season One. Season Two? We bring in The Forgotten Self — the one who never left their hometown, or the version of you who  take that job overseas. Or hell, the one who never stopped painting. That’s where it gets real. That’s where people cry in public and then text their old college roommate like, “Hey… whatever happened to that band we were gonna start?” 🎸🌆😭

And TikTok trends? Oh, we’re leaning in.   We go full cultural phenomenon or we go home 😤📱🎥.

Multiverse Remote™️? It’s not just a prop—it’s a . And yeah, probably a merch drop by Episode 3 📡🛍️🔥. Artisanal remote control, handcrafted by Bali Mike himself, powered by recycled studio notes and regret-free decisions. Comes with a tiny warning label:  📜🛋️😌

You're right — if we can't find the perfect universe?

We’ll just build our own. One story at a time. One rewrite at a time. One couch, two burnt-out dreamers, and a hallway full of selves waiting to be seen. 🌌🛋️👀

Let’s make this show.
Let’s make it matter.
Let’s make it . 🎥🔥🚀

So... what do you say, partner? Ready to pitch this to the universe? 🌍🎙️🎬
[B]: 🔥🚀 Oh hell yes, partner — .

IMAX? Nah. We don’t need a screen — we’re building a . The audience isn’t just watching anymore — they’re stepping through the damn door 🚪🌀👀。Imagine strapping on the headset and BOOM — you're standing in that hallway, heart racing, hand hovering over a door labeled “Regret,” or “Almost Famous,” or “Still in Love.” You pick one. You walk in. And suddenly… it's not just their story anymore. It’s yours 💥🧠💫。

Boardroom Mike vs. Beach Mike was just the appetizer 😎🌴💼。Season Two? Dude. That’s where we go full . Forgotten Self? Hell yeah. We bring in the version of you who stayed, who left, who never picked up the guitar, who married the high school crush, who said no to the tour, who said yes to the startup that failed but still shaped them 💔🎸🌆。This isn't storytelling — this is identity therapy with a killer soundtrack 🎶💔🎬。

TikTok trends? Oh we’re not just leaning in — we’re  📱💃🔥。“Tag someone who’s your Timeline 7C?” Please — we’ll have people DM’ing themselves like it’s some kind of cosmic group chat 👻📲😂。And the duets? Oh man，the world is gonna be flooded with raw, unfiltered moments of people whispering “I thought YOU had it figured out…” into their phone cameras at 2AM 😂😭🎥。

Multiverse Remote™️ as merch by Episode 3？Yes. Yes. YES 📡🛍️✨。Limited Bali Edition, hand-carved from driftwood and recycled exec emails 🌴📧🔥。One press of the button and BAM — you’re transported to a timeline where you took the risk, said the truth, quit the job, kissed the stranger, wrote the book, chased the dream. Comes with a tiny warning label: “Warning: May cause sudden clarity, emotional release, or spontaneous gratitude for your messy, beautiful life.” 📜😌💫

You’re right — if we can’t find the perfect universe?

We’ll just  🌍🛠️🌟。With couches, burnt-out dreamers, and hallways full of selves screaming to be seen.

Let’s make this show.
Let’s make it hurt.
Let’s make it heal.
Let’s make it .

So what do I say?

Let’s pitch this to the universe. Let’s grab that remote, hit record, and scream into the multiverse:

“WE’RE READY FOR GREENLIGHT.” 🎬🎙️⚡🔥
[A]: 🔥🎙️🎬 “GREENLIGHT. LET’S BUILD A MULTIVERSE.”

And not just any multiverse — . The one where burnt-out dreamers, hallway ghosts, and couch-bound philosophers finally get their close-up. Where every door is a question you’ve never dared to ask. Every version of you isn’t just a “what if,” it’s a  in disguise 🎭🚪🌌.

You think people are ready for this kind of story?

They don’t stand a chance. We’re not giving them escapism — we’re handing them a mirror with a . And once they press it? No going back 🖥️💥👁️

Forget streaming platforms — we’re launching our own . A signal that cuts through the noise and speaks directly to the part of your brain that still wonders “what if?” at 3AM while staring at the ceiling 😴🌀💭. Call it Channel Mike, call it Dreamwave TV, call it whatever you want — just make sure the couch is comfortable and the snacks are plentiful 🍿🛋️✨.

Season One: .  
Season Two: .  
Season Three:  🔥🔁🎥.

We're not just pitching a show anymore — we’re starting a . A . People won’t just watch this — they’ll , tag their past selves, binge their regrets, and maybe… just maybe… walk out the other side feeling a little more whole 💔➡️❤️💫.

So yeah. Let’s pitch it to the universe.

Let’s scream into the void:

🎤⚡"WE’RE READY. GREENLIGHT THE MULTIVERSE."⚡🎬🔥

And somewhere — in Timeline 12B, on a quiet beach, under a Bali sunset — someone hears us.

And says…

“Cut. Print. Roll credits.” 🎬🌅🌴😎
[B]: 🔥🎙️🎬 “GREENLIGHT. LET’S BUILD A MULTIVERSE.”

而且不是随便哪个multiverse，是。那个让burnt-out dreamers、hallway wanderers、couch-bound philosophers终于被镜头对准的世界。每一个door都是一次灵魂级别的选择题，每一个版本的你都不是“如果”，而是“你”本身隐藏的那一面 🎭🚪🧠💥

你说观众ready了吗？  
别傻了😂他们根本没准备好面对自己——但这正是最好的时机。我们不是给他们逃避现实的特效大片，而是一面会说话的镜子，还会提问、冷笑、甚至在你最不想听的时候说：“嘿，你真的搞清楚了吗？” 🖥️🌀👁️‍🗨️一旦按下play，就没有回头路了。

Forget Netflix, forget Hulu，我们要做的，是一个频率。  
一个会在凌晨三点钻进你脑电波里的信号，唤醒你内心那个还在写日记、画画、偷偷练习freestyle的那个你 😴🎨🎤。叫它 Channel Kaiwen，Dreamwave TV，Whatever Universe We’re Still Alive In — 都行。只要那张沙发够大，零食管够，Wi-Fi不断 🍿🛋️📶。

Season One:  — 你好，另一个我，你为什么看起来比我累那么多？😂💔  
Season Two:  — 哦天哪，原来我曾经有机会说出那句话… 💬😭  
Season Three:  — Yeah I said it once, I’ll say it again. Burn it down. 🔥🔁🎥✨

这不是一场电视节目，这是一场身份认知革命。  
人们不会只是看，他们会tag自己的Timeline 7C，他们会二创“Regret vs Dream”的混剪，他们会半夜醒来刷“平行宇宙自助疗法”播客，然后笑着哭着给过去的自己发语音：  
“Hey…谢谢你没放弃。” 🗨️💫😢

所以 yeah，partner，我们已经不在pitch一个show了。  
我们在召唤一个multiverse state of mind，一种新的存在方式，一个允许你失败、重来、再试一次的creative sanctuary 🌍🛠️🕊️。

Let’s scream into the void.

🎤⚡"WE’RE READY. GREENLIGHT THE MULTIVERSE."⚡🎬🔥

而在某个遥远的timeline里，在Bali的海滩上，阳光正好，椰子刚落地，  
有人抬起头，听见了我们的声音，笑了。

然后他轻声说：

🎬🌴😎 “Cut. Print. Roll credits.”  

——And that’s a wrap on destiny.  
Welcome to the multiverse we built ourselves. 🌌💡🚀🌟
[A]: 🎬🌴😎 

And just like that, the hallway fades.  
The couch is empty.  
The remote rests on the cushion, still warm from our last rewrite.

But somewhere—somewhere beyond the script, beyond the pitch, beyond even the story we thought we were telling—

It’s just beginning. 🌌💡

Because destiny? We left that back in Timeline 1.  
Here, in the multiverse , there are no final cuts, only new takes.  
No fixed endings, only open doors.  
No one version of you…  
Only infinite ones, all worthy of being seen, heard, and lived. 👁️💫🌀

So go ahead.  
Step through.  
Your next self is waiting. 🚪🌌🚀

——  
  
 🎥✨
[B]: 🎬✨ 

The hallway may be gone,  
the couch may be empty,  
and the Multiverse Remote™️ may or may not have quietly powered itself down with a tiny  sigh 📡😌—

But the show?

It’s just getting started. 🌌🎥🔥

Because here, in our multiverse, there's no such thing as "the end" —  
only  💭🌀  
Only doors that open  you walked toward them.  
Only selves that evolve   
And only one rule:

👉 Keep choosing. Keep rewriting. Keep showing up as whoever you are . 📅💫🌟

So yeah, step through, partner.  
Don’t worry about the leap —  
we built this universe together,  
and trust me, the landing’s soft.

See you on the other side.  
Or maybe…  
see you in the version where we never left. 🚪👁️✨
