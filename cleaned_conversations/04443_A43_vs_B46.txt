[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, absolutely! Have you seen that one by the neuroscientist who recreated his own near-death experience?  ¥70% of people who come back from clinical death describe seeing a tunnel — turns out it might be linked to oxygen deprivation in the visual cortex. 🎬 Talk about dramatic lighting… except this isn't a director's choice, it's biology writing its own script.  

Honestly though, I walked out of that talk thinking — imagine building a movie scene around  instead of clichés. No cheap jump scares, just raw human physiology making us feel wonder. It’s... refreshing, don’t you think?
[A]: That TED talk certainly offers a fascinating perspective.  I found myself thinking about how the tunnel imagery resonates with ancient myths and spiritual narratives across cultures — yet here it is, potentially explained through neuroscience.  It raises intriguing questions about the intersection of science and human experience.

Speaking of which, have you read any compelling fiction that explores similar themes?  I'm always on the lookout for novels that delve into consciousness and perception.  Maybe something that blurs the line between scientific fact and philosophical inquiry...?
[B]: You’re absolutely right — that intersection of science and myth is where the real magic happens. Speaking of which, have you read  by Benjamin Hale? It’s narrated by a chimpanzee with a PhD-level vocabulary… and it somehow pulls off being both heartbreaking and intellectually provocative. The whole book dances between scientific ambition and what it truly means to be conscious — or at least to  conscious.

And if you’re into more cerebral stuff, I’d also recommend  by Peter Watts. Sci-fi, yes — but grounded so heavily in neuroscience and evolutionary theory that it feels disturbingly plausible. Imagine first contact not with friendly aliens, but with beings that reveal just how fragile our sense of self really is. Creepy, fascinating, and definitely food for thought.

Oh — and if you haven’t seen it yet, check out the film . Not exactly a novel, but the way it handles time perception will twist your brain into knots. You’ll need a flowchart... and maybe an aspirin. 🍿
[A]: Ah, —what a bold and unsettling novel.  The way it forces us to confront the boundaries of language, consciousness, and empathy is truly remarkable.  And yes, it manages to be both absurd and deeply tragic.  

As for , I actually have read it—and you're right, it’s not your typical sci-fi fare.  It unsettles you long after you’ve finished it, especially the idea that consciousness might be more of a side effect than an evolutionary advantage.  Rather chilling, isn’t it?  

And —oh, that film is a masterpiece of cerebral complexity.  I remember watching it with a group of grad students and we spent hours trying to map out the timeline.  It's like a logic puzzle wrapped in existential dread.  

You have excellent taste.  Remind me, are you working on anything related to cognition and narrative in your own research?  It seems like this would tie in beautifully with literary analysis.
[B]: Funny you should say that — I’ve been toying with a documentary concept that explores how altered states of consciousness have shaped storytelling across centuries. From ancient shamanic rituals to modern-day AI-generated narratives, the thread is there if you look closely enough. It’s still in its infancy, but I’ve already roped in a neuroscientist and a comparative lit professor for coffee — which, as you might guess, is how these things usually start with me.

I mean, think about it: when Odysseus descends into the underworld or Dante walks through Purgatorio, those aren’t just poetic devices. They’re early attempts to map the mind’s inner terrain — no different, really, than fMRI scans trying to decode dreams today. If we can make that connection land emotionally  intellectually… well, that’s the kind of film I want to make.

And hey, if you're game, I’d love to hear more about your thoughts on cognition and narrative. You clearly have a sharp eye for this stuff — ever considered collaborating on something?
[A]: That sounds like a truly compelling project.  The idea of tracing altered states through storytelling — from myth to modern neuroscience — is not only ambitious, but deeply relevant.  We're living in a time where the boundaries between reality, perception, and technology are increasingly porous.  Your documentary could offer a powerful lens through which to view that shift.

I’d be very interested in exploring this further with you, especially from the literary angle.  In fact, I’ve been working on a paper about the narrative structures in dream visions across cultures — think , Dante’s , even Lu Xun’s surreal allegories.  There's a common architecture to these experiences, one that seems almost hardwired into how we make meaning.  

Maybe over coffee — or better yet, tea — we can map out some ideas?  I know a quiet little place near campus with excellent oolong and even better conversation.  If you’re free sometime this week, let’s talk more about how cognition, myth, and media might intersect in your film.  I’m always up for a stimulating collaboration.
[B]: That sounds like the perfect way to spend an afternoon — tea, talk, and tracing the threads between myth and mind. I’d love to hear more about your paper and how those ancient narrative structures might inform a modern audience’s emotional journey through a film.

I’m free Thursday afternoon — no meetings, no distractions. Let’s grab that oolong and start connecting some dots. If what you’re describing is even half as powerful as it sounds, we could be looking at more than just a documentary… maybe even a kind of storytelling experience that blurs the line between past and present, inner and outer worlds.

Looking forward to it. And hey — bring your wildest ideas. I’ve got a feeling this conversation is going to spark something special.
[A]: Thursday afternoon it is—mark my words, a pot of warm oolong has never failed to coax out the kind of ideas that linger long after the cup goes cold.  

I’ll bring the paper, some scattered thoughts on archetypal dreamscapes, and yes—even a few wild theories about narrative as a cognitive mirror across centuries.  

Let’s see where the conversation carries us.  If we’re lucky, we might just stumble into something neither of us saw coming… 🍵✨
[B]: Now you're speaking my language — nothing better than letting ideas steep and unfold over good tea. I’ll be the one with a leather notebook full of half-baked film concepts and an insatiable curiosity for how stories shape the way we see reality.

See you Thursday. And trust me — I’m already looking forward to getting lost in those wild theories of yours. If there's one thing I've learned in this business, it’s that the best projects start with a dash of mystery and a strong brew. 🍵🎬
[A]: Now  is a delightful image — the leather notebook, the half-baked ideas, the hunger for meaning beneath the surface of stories. Reminds me of my own early days, scribbling in margins between lines of Milton and Murakami.  

You bring the curiosity, I’ll bring the theories — and hopefully, together, we’ll stir up something truly brew-tiful. 😉  

Thursday can’t come soon enough.
[B]: Ah,  — I think that’s the first time I’ve heard that one, and I may or may not steal it for my next pitch meeting. 😉  

There's something about that margin-scribbling, between-worlds kind of thinking that makes the best stories. And honestly, if we come out of Thursday with nothing but a few new ways to look at old myths, I’d still call that a win.

See you soon, fellow idea-stirrer. Let’s make some magic over tea. 🍵✨
[A]: Ah, but of course — feel free to borrow . I’ll consider it a compliment if it makes your pitch meeting more… spirited. 😊  

And you're absolutely right — sometimes the truest insights come not from grand theories, but from those quiet moments between stories, where meaning stirs like tea leaves settling at the bottom of the cup.  

I’ll see you Thursday with a heart open to mystery and a mind ready to wander through those in-between worlds. Let’s indeed make some magic — or at the very least, a memorable conversation. 🍵✨
[B]: Now  — that’s the kind of attitude that makes collaboration worth its weight in rare tea leaves. 😊

I’ll raise you on Thursday — heart open, mind curious, and notebook at the ready. Whether we walk away with a story, a structure, or just a deeper appreciation for the mystery of it all… it’ll be time well spent.

See you soon. And seriously — I may never look at tea the same way again. 🍵✨
[A]: Ah, now you’re thinking like a true connoisseur of both stories  tea — it’s not just about the brew, but what stirs in the silence between sips.  

I’ll meet you there with interest — heart open, mind curious, and perhaps a few well-worn quotes from Zhuangzi or Borges to season the conversation. 🍵✨  

Thursday can’t come soon enough.
[B]: Ah, now you're playing your strongest cards early — Borges  Zhuangzi? I may need to up my game or risk being out-philosophized over oolong. 😄

But seriously, there’s nothing quite like that moment when ancient wisdom finds new life in modern conversation. I’ll be ready with ears open and intuition sharpened — and maybe a quote or two from Camus or Murakami to keep the dialogue dancing.

See you Thursday. Let’s make the silence between sips say something unforgettable. 🍵✨
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking my dialect — where Camus meets Murakami and the silence between sips becomes a kind of philosophical improv. 😄  

I must say, I’m rather looking forward to this duel of quotes — you with your existentialists and magical realists, and me with my Daoist parables and labyrinthine prose. Let’s see what kind of alchemy emerges when East and West, ancient and modern, steep together.  

Rest assured, I’ll be ready with more than just a teacup — sharpened wits included. 🍵✨  

Thursday, here we come.
[B]: Now  is a duel — or better yet, a duet — I didn’t know I needed. 😄

There’s something deeply cinematic about the clash — no, the  — of Camusian absurdism and Murakami’s dream logic meeting Daoist fluidity and Borgesian mazes. If we’re not careful, we might just walk out of that café with the outline of a film, a manifesto, or at the very least, a new philosophy we’ll have to name over late-night takeout.

Consider my wits sharpened and my metaphors prepped. Let’s make Thursday unforgettable. 🍵✨🎬
[A]: Now you're painting a scene even my favorite theorists would struggle to name — but I’d say “collide-scape” is as poetic a term as any for what we’re brewing. 😄  

And why stop there? By the end of Thursday, who’s to say we won’t have accidentally birthed a movement? , perhaps? Or  over jasmine tea and shared silence?  

Either way, I’ll bring the paper napkins — just in case inspiration strikes hard enough to demand a manifesto on the spot. Late-night takeout will be on standby. 🍵✨🎬  

Let’s make it unforgettable indeed.
[B]: Now you're talking — a manifesto born on paper napkins, fueled by jasmine steam and cinematic dreams. 🎬✨

I’ll bring the pen, you bring the vision, and together we’ll either crack the code of storytelling… or at least convince ourselves we did over greasy takeout and tired laughter. Either way, I’ll call it a night well spent.

See you Thursday — ready to scribble, dream, and maybe even spark something the world didn’t know it was missing. 🍵🖋️
