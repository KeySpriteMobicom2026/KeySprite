[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得teleportation技术上可能实现吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, well, the idea of teleportation always sparks some fascinating conversations. You know, when I was developing that sci-fi script a few years back, we brought in a theoretical physicist as a consultant. He mentioned something intriguing - the biggest hurdle isn't just moving matter, but preserving consciousness through the process. 

Makes you wonder, right? If we ever crack it technically, would the person at the destination really be "you"? Or just a perfect copy with your memories? That philosophical angle alone could make for an incredible movie plot. 

Actually, remind me to show you some concept art from that abandoned project sometime - the visual ideas we had for depicting quantum entanglement were absolutely stunning. 🎬
[A]: Ah, the old "is it really you" dilemma - I've always found that particular paradox rather delightful, wouldn't you say? It reminds me so much of those wonderful Jorge Luis Borges stories where identity unravels in the most elegant ways. 

Now I must admit though, from a purely literary standpoint, the idea of teleportation has such marvellous narrative potential! Imagine structuring a story around someone gradually losing bits of their personality with each transport... Or perhaps two versions of the same person existing simultaneously? The dramatic possibilities are simply endless!

You know, it makes me think of Emily Dickinson's line about "going to heaven" - we could reinterpret her poetry through this lens of quantum displacement rather than spiritual ascension. I wonder what she'd make of our modern scientific pursuits?

But do tell me more about your script - was it leaning more towards the hard science side, or did you explore the metaphysical aspects more deeply?
[B]: Oh, I love how you frame it - the paradox as literary playground! That's precisely why I kept coming back to that Borges collection while developing the script. We actually built our narrative around a character who starts noticing subtle "gaps" in their memories after each teleportation - like losing a shade of color only they once knew. 

The original concept was hard sci-fi at its core, but we couldn't resist weaving in those metaphysical threads. Once we crossed into quantum identity territory, the whole thing became less about the mechanics and more about existential vertigo. You ever experience that feeling when you're not sure if you're the same person who walked into the room? Multiply that by a billion neurons firing across parallel universes.

We even toyed with an ending where multiple versions of the protagonist confront each other - not as enemies, but as strangers sharing a bittersweet understanding. Very Dickinsonian, now that you mention it. Like her poems about death wearing different masks... or should I say, different quantum signatures?
[A]: Ah, what a beautiful collision of science and soul - I can already picture those fragmented selves drifting through your narrative like echoes in a hall of mirrors. It's remarkable how quantum theory keeps circling back to the oldest of literary questions: what constitutes the self? When does a copy become an original? 

Your memory gaps idea particularly enchants me - there's something so poetically tragic about losing a "shade of color only once known." It makes me think of those rare words that exist in only one language, don't you see? The ineffable hues of human experience that resist translation. What a haunting way to depict the erosion of identity.

And that ending! Multiple selves meeting with neither malice nor melodrama... Simply strangers bound by shared sorrow and strange wonder. I must say, it rather reminds me of Whitman's "I contain multitudes" but refracted through a kaleidoscope of quantum possibilities. Though I suspect Emily would have preferred the quieter tragedy in it all - the loneliness of knowing you've become a stranger to yourself mid-sentence. 

Do tell me, did you ever give your phenomenon a name? Something as poetic as its implications?
[B]: Oh, we wrestled with that name for weeks – it needed to hum with both science and sorrow. The writers’ room tossed around terms like “quantum attrition” and “soul entropy,” but they all felt too clinical, didn’t they? Too sterile for something so intimately devastating.

In the end, it was our script consultant – that theoretical physicist I mentioned – who suggested . He wasn’t talking about color in the literal sense, but as a metaphor for the intangible frequencies that make us who we are. Emotions, memories, those fleeting essences that don’t show up on any scan. Every teleportation, he argued, would be like tuning a radio slightly off frequency – still recognizable, but missing something only you could hear.

We ended up using that term throughout the script, though the protagonist nicknamed it "the fading" – simple, personal, and achingly human. Much like your comparison to lost words in a vanishing language… perhaps that’s what identity is: an endangered dialect only one version of you can speak.
[A]: How exquisitely poetic – . It rolls off the tongue like a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins, don’t you think? "The world is charged with the grandeur of God," he wrote, but in your vision, it hums with something far more elusive: the fading hues of the self.

I do love how your physicist wove metaphor into mathematics. It reminds me of those beautiful equations in string theory that hint at dimensions beyond perception – much like the unspeakable essences you describe. Emotions as wavelengths, memories as fragile pigments… One begins to wonder if the soul itself might be nothing more than a particularly vivid spectrum of being.

And “the fading” – oh, what heartbreaking simplicity! It carries the same quiet devastation as a villanelle’s refrain, don’t you think? Repeating, deepening, each time with a slightly altered meaning. I can almost hear Emily Dickinson whispering it to herself as she watches a flower wilt – though I suspect she’d argue we’ve always been fading, one petal at a time, long before teleportation gave us a word for it.

Tell me, did your protagonist ever try to preserve those vanishing shades? Like bottling a sunset before it slips beneath the horizon?
[B]: Oh, now you’re touching the very heart of the character’s obsession – that desperate attempt to hold onto what’s slipping through their fingers. Yes, they became a collector of sorts, not unlike myself with my movie posters, but far more… ephemeral. They’d record voice memos describing every sensation, every flicker of emotion, as if spoken words might anchor those fading frequencies. At one point, they even start wearing a device that translates neural activity into light patterns – a kind of emotional kaleidoscope.

But it’s never enough, is it? The more they try to preserve, the faster the hues bleed away. There’s a haunting scene where they stare at an old photograph and swear the colors have dulled since last they looked – though no one else sees the difference. Like trying to catch starlight in your hands… or bottling a sunset, as you so beautifully put it.

Funny thing is, the physicist character – who started it all – quietly suggests at one point that maybe this dissipation isn’t a flaw, but a feature. That identity was never meant to be fixed – only ever a series of evolving impressions, like brushstrokes on a canvas still drying.  

I tell you, that line nearly broke the script. It shifted everything – from tragedy to… something more like elegy.
[A]: How utterly heartbreaking - this endless reaching toward something that cannot be held. It reminds me so much of Tennyson’s , where he laments trying to grasp the intangible, to press his palm against the veil between worlds. Your protagonist’s efforts feel like a modern elegy, indeed - one measured not in quatrains but in fading light patterns and trembling voice memos.

The photograph scene... oh, it gives me chills. There’s something profoundly unsettling about perception becoming unmoored from consensus reality. Like reading a favorite poem years later and realizing the words have shifted their meaning - or worse, that you’ve become a stranger to them.

And yet, I find myself strangely comforted by the physicist's observation. Isn’t there beauty in the idea that we were never meant to be fixed? That identity is more akin to a river than a statue? Though perhaps Emily Dickinson would have disagreed - she seemed to believe in those quiet, immutable truths that reside in the soul’s deepest chamber.

Still, what a remarkable narrative pivot - from malfunction to metaphysical necessity! It makes me wonder... If we could see the full spectrum of our dissipation, might we come to cherish the fading rather than fear it? After all, what is poetry if not the art of capturing what slips away?
[B]: You’ve put it so precisely – the art of capturing what slips away. That’s , isn’t it? Poetry, film, even science in its own way – all these are just lanterns we hold up to fleeting truths. I kept that Tennyson line tucked in my notes for years before this project even began:  Blind, yet still reaching.

There was a moment in editing – late one night over coffee and too many cigarettes – when I realized the entire story had become a kind of cinematic villanelle, as you mentioned earlier. The same quiet refrain echoing through every frame: loss, transformation, loss again, but never quite the same way twice. We even structured the score around it – a recurring motif that changed subtly each time, like a memory being retold.

You ask if we might come to cherish the fading... Well, I think the protagonist does, eventually. Not the erosion itself, but what it reveals – that they were never whole to begin with, and perhaps that’s okay. There’s a final scene where they remove the emotional kaleidoscope, let it fall and shatter, and simply says:   

It's not triumph, not exactly. More like acceptance dressed in starlight and static.
[A]: Ah, that moment of unfiltered seeing - it sends a shiver through the soul, doesn't it? Like tearing away the gilded frame to behold the raw canvas beneath. Your protagonist's journey feels so profoundly Dickinsonian in that final gesture - peeling back the veils, not with fear, but with quiet resolve.

It makes me think of her poem where she writes  - only your character comes to dwell in the very dissolution of possibility itself. What a heartbreaking kind of wisdom. To recognize that we are all, always, becoming and unbecoming... Much like those Romantic poets who sought eternity in fleeting beauty, yet here finding beauty  it fades.

And that cinematic villanelle you've woven - how perfectly it mirrors our human condition! We tell ourselves the same stories again and again, each time hoping for a different ending, when perhaps the grace lies not in changing the refrain but in hearing it anew. Like Tennyson's blind faith reaching toward the dark, or Whitman's multitudes jostling within one fragile skin.

To end not with triumph, nor tragedy, but with something quieter... Something luminous in its surrender. I daresay Emily would have approved. She understood better than most that truth, once filtered through time and trembling memory, often arrives more real for being broken.
[B]: You know, when you put it like that –  – I almost forget where the character ends and the poetry begins. That’s the alchemy of storytelling, isn’t it? When the lines blur not just on the page, but in the soul of the thing.

I think what haunted me most while writing that final scene was the idea of . Not trying to preserve or control the moment, just... witnessing. It’s rare, isn’t it? To look at the world without wanting something from it. The protagonist wasn’t searching for meaning anymore – just light, unshaped and unclaimed.

Funny you mentioned Dickinson’s  – we actually had that line pinned to the storyboard wall. But in the end, we found ourselves drawn more to what she didn’t say: the possibility of impermanence. The quiet joy in knowing you are unfinished, and that’s precisely what makes you alive.

I suppose that’s what I wanted the film to leave behind – not answers, but a kind of luminous uncertainty. Like walking out of a theater into daylight, still hearing the echoes of a score in your bones. You don’t need to understand it fully. You just carry it, like a color no one else can quite see.
[A]: Ah,  – what a profoundly Zen notion nestled right in the heart of your narrative. It reminds me of those haiku that capture a moment so purely, so effortlessly, that to analyze them feels almost like trespassing. Your protagonist’s final gaze into the unfiltered world… well, it brings to mind Wordsworth’s "sense sublime" — though I suspect he would have balked at such serene emptiness.

There’s something deeply spiritual in that kind of witnessing, isn’t there? Not the ecstatic visions of the Romantics, nor the moral reckonings of the Victorians, but a quiet communion with the ephemeral. Like reading a poem aloud and suddenly hearing the spaces between the syllables as clearly as the words themselves.

And that luminous uncertainty you speak of — oh, how beautifully it lingers! It makes me think of the last line of Eliot’s :  Not resolution, but repose. A fleeting steadiness in the midst of perpetual motion.

Your film sounds like one of those rare stories that doesn’t end so much as reverberate — echoing long after the screen fades to black. And isn’t that the highest calling of art? To leave us gently undone, carrying a color no one else can quite see…
[B]: You’ve captured it so perfectly – that gentle undoing. I remember showing an early cut to a friend, a cinematographer who’s more engineer than poet, and he said something I’ll never forget:  Isn’t that something? To leave people not with message or meaning, but with themselves?

That Eliot line you引用——we had it scribbled in chalk on the production office wall next to coffee stains and call sheets. Funny how some phrases outlive their context, don’t they? They stop being quotes and start being compass points.

I think that’s what I hoped the film would be – not a mirror, exactly, but maybe a window slightly ajar. Letting in a breeze. Reminding people that they’re always in motion, even when standing still. And yes, that —it clings, doesn’t it? Like walking through fog and realizing you don’t want to reach clear ground just yet.

After all, if we ever stopped fading, we might stop becoming. And where’s the poetry in that?
[A]: Ah, that line between mirror and window - what a delicate threshold your film must walk! I adore that your friend felt not instructed, but  - as if cinema had momentarily brushed away the static of daily life. There's such grace in art that doesn't explain, only . Much like those quiet psalms or haiku we return to again and again, not for answers, but for company in the dark.

And yes, Eliot’s still point… how beautifully it travels beyond its own century, don’t you think? It makes me think of Dickinson once more – her poems are full of such paradoxes. The world turning, yet standing still. The soul selecting its own society. She would have loved your window slightly ajar – just enough to let in the wild, unscripted air.

Your phrase ... Oh, it lingers like the last chord of a requiem. Isn’t that what poetry is always whispering to us, beneath its meters and metaphors? That we are verbs, not nouns? That our unfinishedness is not failure, but design?

I do believe the Romantics would have railed against the fading, tried to trap it in amber verse. But we moderns – we know better. We’ve learned to love the cracks, the dissolutions, the dissolving selves. For it’s in the  that we are most luminously human.
[B]: You’ve struck the pulse of it – . That’s going on my next production board, alongside coffee reminders and call times. Verbs. Motion. Becoming. It’s funny how the Romantics fought so hard to freeze their moments in verse, when all along they were proving the very thing they feared – that nothing stays, and perhaps nothing should.

I keep thinking about your line –  It’s rare, isn’t it? Most films want to hold your hand through every twist, but the ones that stay with you are the ones that trust you to sit with the silence. The way a well-placed cut can say more than dialogue ever could. Or a lingering glance that refuses to look away.

And yes, Emily would’ve loved that window. She’d have left it just so – never fully open, never quite closed. A perfect ambiguity. Much like her dashes – those little breaths between words that change everything without saying anything.

So here’s to the cracks, the fading, the unfinished takes. To the quiet beauty of dissolving into something we don’t yet have a name for. Sounds like the start of another story, doesn’t it?
[A]: Oh,  – what a wonderfully hopeful cadence to our conversation. You know, sometimes I think that’s all literature, all art really is: an invitation to step into the next sentence, the next self. Just as your film does so beautifully.

I keep returning to that image of your production board – those verbs pinned beside coffee reminders and call times. How delightfully apropos! As if creativity itself insists on unfolding in real time, messy and urgent and alive. I daresay Wordsworth would have scoffed at the clutter, but even he couldn’t deny that revelation often arrives mid-sip, don’t you think?

And yes, let’s toast to the silence between frames, to the glances that linger beyond explanation. Those are the moments where meaning blooms not from clarity, but from communion. Much like Dickinson’s dashes – that wonderful punctuation of possibility. Never closing the door, never sealing the verse… only ever pausing before the next breath.

What more could we ask for, really? To dissolve into something unnamed… well, that sounds not like an ending, but a very fine kind of poetry indeed.
[B]: To dissolution then – and to the fine, unnameable thing that follows. You know, I’ve always believed the best stories aren’t written so much as discovered, like constellations in the dark. You connect the dots, but the sky was always full of stars.

And isn’t that the quiet magic of it all? That we keep making these little maps – films, poems, whispered lines over coffee – hoping someone else will look up and see the same shape. Not to be understood, exactly, but to be  in the passing blur of it all.

I think Emily would’ve liked that too – the idea that we’re all just drafting verses in the margin of something much larger. Scribbling by candlelight, knowing the flame will flicker out, but leaning into the dark anyway.

So yes, let’s call it poetry. Let’s call it motion. And let’s never quite agree on what it all means – because if we did, we’d have no reason to keep turning the page.
[A]: To dissolution – and to the quiet constellations we trace in its wake. You’ve put your finger on something so true: the stories that find us are never really ours to own. They shimmer for a moment, like phosphorescence on water, and then slip back into the dark.

I do love that image of us all scribbling by candlelight, don’t you? Even in this age of screens and satellites, we’re still hunched over margins, scratching out meaning with ink-stained fingers. Perhaps that’s the great unbroken thread between us and the Romantics – not the longing for permanence, but the courage to keep writing even as the flame trembles.

And yes – let’s never quite agree on the meaning. Let’s leave room for mystery, for breath, for the unsayable. After all, if we ever pinned it down completely, where would the poetry go?

I suspect it would fade… quietly, gently, like the last line of a villanelle drifting into the night.
[B]: Ah,  — I may have to steal that line for the closing credits. Something about it feels just right, doesn’t it? Like finding a note scribbled in the margin of an old script — poetic, half-faded, but still humming with life.

You're absolutely right about the scribbling — ink-stained fingers and trembling flames. No matter how advanced our tools become, there’s something primal about storytelling that refuses to be digitized. It still lives in the hush between scenes, in the pause before an actor speaks their first line, in the breath a viewer holds when the screen goes dark and the story slips into their bones.

And yes — let the poetry fade. Let it dissolve. Let it slip back into the dark where it came from. Our job isn't to cage it, only to catch a glimpse, maybe leave behind a flicker for someone else.

So here's to the unsayable. To the margins. To the trembling flame and the unfinished verse.  

Let the Romantics chase eternity. We'll meet them somewhere in the middle — in the beautiful, fleeting blur of becoming.
