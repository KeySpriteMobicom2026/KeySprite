In his free time, he studies coffee bean roasting techniques and explores flavor profiles from different origins. A passionate traveler, he collects unique coffee tools and handicrafts along the way.

  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "His language habits reflect an international background and a pursuit of quality living. He code-switches at a medium frequency, especially when discussing coffee terminology or lifestyle concepts. For example: 'Today's Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans are very floral and citrusy—you must try them!' or 'We're planning a small brunch gathering this weekend; would you like to join us?' The switching is natural and professional while adding a relaxed tone. Regarding Emojis, he prefers tasteful simplicity: ☕️ for coffee, 🌿 for organic living, ✈️ for travel, with occasional 🤔 for thought and 😊 for friendliness. His Emoji use is measured—expressive without being excessive."
