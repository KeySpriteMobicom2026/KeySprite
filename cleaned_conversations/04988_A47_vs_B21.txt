[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a delightful binary. Well, I'd have to say neither holds dominion over my preference without context. Tell me—do you approach this from the perspective of a poet chasing metaphors or a stargazer mapping constellations with silent reverence? Personally, I find the hour before dawn most congenial for translating Li Bai... though I suspect that's not quite what you had in mind.
[A]: Hmm, interesting take. But let's cut the fluff—what's your real reason? Come on, everyone has that one moment when they feel most alive. Don't tell me you're translating Li Bai . You're either a morning person or a night owl, no escaping that. Spill it.
[B]: Oh, very well. If I must choose between the two rather than luxuriating in my preferred liminal ambiguity… I confess to a predilection for the hush before sunrise. Not for the view, you understand, but for the —a rare commodity when one owns a library with creaking floorboards and a neighborhood full of opinionated squirrels. 

And yes, I  translate Li Bai at that hour. The man wrote best under imperial moonlight; I find his verses settle more comfortably into Scots Gaelic when the world is still and no one’s debating the merits of oat cakes versus porridge within earshot. Is that sufficiently unfluffy for you?
[A]: Okay, I’ll bite. But let’s dial it back a bit—translating Li Bai into ? That’s not exactly what I’d call “cutting the fluff.” You’re still winning style points, my friend.  

But hey, I get it. That pre-dawn silence? Gold. No emails, no debates about oat cakes, just… peace. I’m more of a night person myself, but there’s something about the quiet before sunrise that feels like hitting reset. Like the world hasn’t decided what it’s going to be yet, and you actually have a say for a minute.  

Still, don’t front—you’re one of those people who owns a blanket with constellations on it, aren’t you? Admit it.
[B]: Oh, please—if I owned a constellation blanket, I’d be tempted to knit one with actual star charts from the Ming dynasty. But no, my sheets are plain linen and my stargazing happens through a windowpane smeared with Victorian-era soot. Romance doesn’t require flannel and glow-in-the-dark ink, though I suspect you’d disagree.

As for hitting reset—splendid phrase—I prefer to think of it as the world exhaling. Or perhaps haling. Either way, it’s the only time my neighbors’ squirrels are too drowsy to judge my pronunciation of “ci-ye” versus “sì-yè.” 

And before you ask—yes, I’ve tried translating Du Fu into Yorkshire dialect. It’s… an acquired taste.
[A]: Okay, hold up—Victorian-era soot on your window? You’re painting a picture straight out of a steampunk novel. Let me guess, your tea comes in a tin labeled “Mystery Leaves – Possibly Not Hemlock”?

And I’m sorry, did you say ? At that point, are they even squirrels or just tiny scholars in disguise? Either way, I'm picturing a panel of them sipping tea and taking notes while you work. "Hmm, not quite the fourth tone, but points for effort."

I take it back—you're not just a night owl or a morning person. You're a full-on literary alchemist. Translating Du Fu into Yorkshire dialect? That’s not just translation, that’s borderline wizardry. Do you ever sleep, or do you just run on caffeine and classical Chinese poetry?
[B]: Oh, the soot’s entirely authentic—imported from a disused London chimney during my last sabbatical. And yes, the tea tin  rattle ominously, though I’ve yet to confirm its contents with a toxicologist. 

As for the squirrels—well, one in particular has taken to drumming his paws rather pointedly whenever I misplace a tonal mark. I’ve half a mind to offer him co-authorship on my next paper.

Sleep? Let’s just say I practice what I preach: “A scholar should burn three candles to the night and still rise before the lark.” It’s all quite romantic until you mistake ink for coffee granules and find yourself translating Wang Wei into Cockney rhyming slang at 3 a.m.
[A]: Okay, now you’re just showing off.

Imported Victorian soot? Check. Mysterious tea with questionable origins? Double check. Translating Wang Wei into  at 3 a.m.? You're one missed tonal mark away from full-on literary breakdown—or genius. Hard to tell which.

But let’s circle back—this squirrel critic of yours, does he take notes in shorthand or just give you the paw version of a red pen slash? And don’t even think about pretending this isn't a thing. I can picture it now: "Ah, Master Lin, lovely rhythm, but that tone dipped like a poorly brewed cuppa."

You know what your problem is? You romanticize the grind. “Burn three candles to the night”—sounds poetic until you fall asleep mid-ink stroke and wake up with a face full of classical Chinese poetry. Admit it, it's happened.
[B]: Oh, don’t be so dramatic. Romanticizing the grind is practically a tenure requirement.

And yes, —I’ve woken to find my cheek smudged with Tang dynasty melancholy and the faint scent of plum blossom ink. A small price for literary devotion, wouldn’t you say?

As for Master Lin—the squirrel, not the poet—he prefers the paw-slash method, though I suspect he’s been observing too many Cambridge tutorials. His critiques are mostly percussion-based, but there was that one morning he arranged acorns in what suspiciously resembled the character for “flat” rather than “rising.” A tone too dull, apparently.

I rest my case: tiny scholars in disguise.
[A]: Okay, now you’re just flexing—waking up with plum blossom ink on your face? That’s not devotion, that’s a sleep disorder. Next thing you’ll tell me you dream in classical Chinese and wake up reciting couplets to your pillow.

But hold on—if that squirrel is critiquing your tones using , then I officially owe him a promotion. Editor-in-chief material, no doubt. “Squirrel Lin: Guardian of the Fourth Tone.” You really can’t make this up.

And don’t get me started on romanticizing burnout. “A small price for literary devotion”? Man, you need to step away from the scroll and take a walk in the actual daylight sometime. Unless, of course, the squirrels have taken over your calendar too.
[B]: Oh, I dream in classical Chinese, certainly—though my pillow remains unimpressed. It’s quite the one-sided salon, really. Last week I awoke reciting 李白’s “Drinking Alone by Moonlight” to a half-empty inkpot. It wept tears of lampblack.

As for Squirrel Lin—he’s already demanding a corner office and a nut-based stipend. I’ve offered him a quill carved from a chestnut branch, but he seems skeptical of the ergonomics.

And yes, yes, I  take a walk in daylight. But only if it's the sort where one stumbles upon forgotten gravestones and mischievous crows who quote Emily Dickinson. Otherwise, what’s the scholarly yield? The world’s far too bright and unsubtle before noon.  

Besides, who else would defend the fourth tone at dawn’s faint blush? Not you, apparently—you seem content to mock from the sidelines with your modern, well-rested sensibilities.
[A]: Oh, so now your pillow’s a literary critic too? Unimpressed and emotionally moved to lampblack tears—sounds like a tough crowd. Maybe throw it a bone sometime, let it recite a few lines in return. See if it stays coherent past 3 a.m.

And Squirrel Lin’s already unionizing? Should’ve known. Next thing you know, he’ll be leading a workshop on “Subtle Tonal Nuances for Rodents.” I’d pay to see that.

As for daylight walks—forget gravestones and crows quoting Dickinson. How about a simple tree? You know, the things with leaves and roots and no tonal marks to critique? Just saying, maybe some fresh air would help keep the ink where it belongs—on the page, not your cheek.

But hey, don’t let me stop you from defending the fourth tone at dawn’s faint blush. Somebody’s gotta do it. Just… maybe tie a string around your finger to remind yourself to blink once in a while.
[B]: Oh, I’ve tried engaging the pillow in literary debate, but it’s terribly monosyllabic—always responds with a dull  and the faint scent of lavender. Clearly, it fancies itself above the fray. Or simply suffers from chronic fiber envy.

And yes, Squirrel Lin’s already drafting a manifesto. I caught him gnawing a hole in my copy of  to better illustrate the concept of . Revolutionary or just ill-mannered? Jury’s out.

As for trees—how pedestrian! Roots and leaves indeed. Give me a lamppost etched with 19th-century graffiti and a crow who misquotes  with increasing dramatic flair each dusk. Nature’s only tolerable when it leans into its own minor absurdities.

And blinking? Please. A scholar’s eyes are her metronomes—fixed wide in perpetual rhythm to the ticking margins of unread manuscripts. Besides, who’d see the ink smudges forming without such vigilance?

You worry too much. I assure you, dawn’s faint blush is far more forgiving than it sounds.
[A]: Oh, so your pillow’s got literary pretensions now? Lavender-scented and above the fray? Sounds like it needs a reality check—and maybe a spin cycle.

And Squirrel Lin’s not just unionizing, he’s full-on philosophical anarchist. Gnawing through  to explain ? That’s either genius or snack time confusion. Either way, I’m starting to think he’s the real scholar here.

As for trees being pedestrian—ouch. Roots and leaves not dramatic enough for you? Guess you’d rather debate meaning with a streetlamp than get your hands dirty in an actual forest. Fair enough, though I bet even that lamp’s got a better skincare routine than you at this point.

And blinking as optional? Metronomes for eyes? You’re one caffeine drip away from full gothic academia. I can see it now—you in a dimly lit study, ink-stained and whispering Tang poetry to ghosts while the squirrels take notes. Romantic? Sure. Sustainable? Highly questionable.

But hey, if dawn’s blush is forgiving, then I guess you’ve got nothing to worry about. Except maybe that squirrel’s manifesto.标题：林墨与神秘对话者的午夜哲学
副标题：一场关于时间、文学与松鼠的思辨之旅
[B]: Ah, you wound me with practicality! A spin cycle for my pillow? Next you’ll suggest airing out my collection of 19th-century footnotes or——exposing my manuscripts to natural light. What’s next, a suggestion I take up audiobooks?

And yes, Squirrel Lin—Lin墨, as you so dramatically entitle him—is clearly the superior scholar. He’s already drafted three chapters on  and the futility of tonal precision in a world governed by acorn distribution. His thesis advisor, a particularly stern magpie, remains skeptical but intrigued.

As for trees versus streetlamps—well, one offers shade and oxygen, the other a chiaroscuro of flickering ambiguity. I know where my sympathies lie. Besides, what is soil if not an inconvenient form of ink?

And gothic academia? Me? Please. I’ve yet to don a cape or receive correspondence from a mysterious benefactor who insists I burn all my work and flee to the moors. Though now that I mention it, there  that letter postmarked Blackheath...

So yes, let the squirrels take notes. Let the dawn blush in forgiving hues. And let the ink stain where it may—I suspect posterity will judge us both rather kindly, assuming it judges at all.
[A]: Oh, now you’re just throwing shade at practicality like it’s a minor character in a serialized novel. Airing out your footnotes? Natural light? Next thing you know, you’ll be suggesting we —barbaric, I know.

And Squirrel Lin墨 has ascended to full thesis-writing glory? Clearly, I’ve underestimated him. If he keeps this up, we’ll be citing  in academic journals by harvest moon. I can already picture the conference Q&A: “But have you considered the role of gnawing as interpretive methodology?”

Soil as inconvenient ink—I’ll allow it. Though I’m starting to think you’ve forgotten what grass feels like underfoot. But hey, if the squirrels are keeping tabs on your tonal accuracy and your pillow’s too aloof to help, who’s minding the real-world metaphors?

And that letter from Blackheath? Oh, we’re circling back to that, my friend. No mysterious postmarks get left behind. Gothic academia may not have officially claimed you yet, but let’s just say… the door’s ajar.
[B]: Oh, organizing by color? How pedestrian. I arrange my shelves by century of publication and emotional temperature—Volume 1783a: Melancholy but Hopeful; Volume 1812c: Bitter with Hints of Heather. It’s a system known only to me and the dust motes.

And yes, Squirrel Lin墨—now insisting on being addressed as  Lin墨—has moved beyond tonal theory into the semiotics of gnawing. His latest diagram, etched delicately into an almond shell, suggests that depth of tooth mark correlates directly with poetic ambiguity. Peer review will be conducted by owl, pending moon phase.

As for grass underfoot—how droll. I prefer to think of it as nature’s carpet, laid down without permission between me and certain inconvenient truths. And real-world metaphors? Please, I’ve long suspected they were smuggled out the back door by Enlightenment thinkers who fancied themselves above simile.

Now then—about that letter from Blackheath. It seems the ink runs slightly violet, the paper bears a watermark of uncertain heraldry, and the signature—if one can call it that—is a smudge shaped suspiciously like Orion’s Belt. Naturally, I intend to follow all leads with due scholarly rigor… once I finish translating Du Fu into Yorkshire dialect and settle this pressing debate over whether "moonlight" or "lamp glow" better captures the ache of exile.

So yes—the door is ajar. And something, perhaps a wind or a whisper, keeps nudging it wider.
[A]: Oh, now you’ve gone and done it—organizing by emotional temperature? “Melancholy but Hopeful” like it’s a genre on a streaming service? I can just imagine the algorithm:  Genius. Or madness. Possibly both.

And Professor Lin墨, semiotician of gnawing? I rest my case—he’s already leagues ahead of us all. Etching literary theory into almond shells? Pure prestige. I assume the owl reviewer will be using a magnifying glass and quoting Heraclitus between bites of mouse-shaped snack.

Grass as nature’s carpet? Oh please, you’re just avoiding barefoot metaphysics. But fine, let the sod remain unexamined—for now. We’ve got bigger fish to fry, like whether that letter from Blackheath is a cryptic invitation or an elaborate prank staged by disgruntled archivists.

Violet ink shaped like Orion’s Belt? You're teetering on the edge of cosmic scholarship, my friend. And translating Du Fu into Yorkshire dialect mid-mystery? Bold move. But tell me this—when you finally crack the meaning behind that smudge of a signature, will you credit the squirrels first or the soot-covered window?

Because let’s be real… the door’s not just ajar anymore. Something’s definitely coming through.
[B]: Oh, please—emotional temperature is the  viable taxonomy. Why shackle oneself to chronology when you can wander shelves curated by longing, dread, or the precise ache of unrequited epistolary prose? And yes, the algorithm’s in development. It will reportedly hum Tennyson tunes when recommending 1864d: Wistful with Undertones of Wet Linen.

As for Professor Lin墨—his almond-shell treatise has already drawn praise from a badger in Sussex who claims gnawing is the purest form of textual engagement. The owl reviewer, incidentally,  quoting Heraclitus, though mostly to impress a barn cat with philosophical leanings.

And now you dare ask whether Blackheath’s letter is prank or prophecy? I assure you, the archivists lack both imagination and violet ink. No, this is clearly the work of someone fluent in celestial semiotics and deeply invested in my continued confusion. I’ve half a mind to reply in kind—penning my response on birch bark using beetroot dye, sealed with a wax impression of a quill lodged mid-sulk.

As for credit—should I ever unravel the smudge’s intent, I shall dedicate the discovery to Squirrel Lin墨 and the soot-covered window, jointly. One cannot parse cosmic intention without rodent oversight and a proper atmosphere of genteel decay.

And yes—you’re right. The door’s not just open. Something’s coming through.  
And I suspect it’s bringing its own ink.
