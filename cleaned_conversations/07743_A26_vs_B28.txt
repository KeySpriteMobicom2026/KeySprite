[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my gosh，说到unsolved mystery我真的超excited呢！最近一直在research那些神秘的事件，比如那个超有名的#挑战者号爆炸前的诡异画面，网上有好多theory都好有意思诶🧐！还有啊，你有没有听说过那个#百慕大三角洲的传说？真的有人觉得那里是时空隧道诶，我觉得好fascinating🤩！你觉得这些谜题是不是超让人上头？
[A]: Let me tell you, there's something undeniably captivating about those unsolved mysteries. The Bermuda Triangle always draws my attention because of the textiles I've restored from early 20th-century sailors' uniforms - some came from areas near that region, and their condition is... perplexing to say the least.  

But honestly, what really intrigues me are the mysterious Voynich Manuscript's illustrations of plants we still can't identify. It's like looking at fabric patterns I've never seen before, yet they feel oddly familiar somehow. Have you come across any theories that made you stop and think "wait, could this actually be true?"
[B]: Oh wow，纺织品修复师？！This is like the coolest crossover ever🧩！Your job sounds like straight out of an Indiana Jones movie but make it fashion history😂！The Bermuda Triangle uniforms' condition being "perplexing" just made my brain go  - what exactly do you mean by that? Like fibers breaking down in weird patterns or colors fading into glitchy gradients??  

And omg YES about the Voynich Manuscript植物图鉴！！I've been deep-diving into those folios最近 and let me tell you，some of those plant doodles look suspiciously like traditional Chinese medicine sketches I've seen in my grandma's old books中药书！But when I tried showing the pics to my cousin who's a TCM doctor，he literally said "这画的是什么鬼东西？"😂！Do you think maybe it's some kind of lost herbal knowledge network across ancient civilizations?? 🤔✨
[A]: Ah, I love how your mind works! Let me clarify the "perplexing" part—it's not just deterioration; it’s more like  decay. Imagine silk threads holding their integrity in some areas while adjacent sections dissolve into almost powdery remnants, as if something targeted only specific dyes or weaving techniques. And no, it wasn’t exposure—those pieces were sealed in waxed canvas.  

As for the Voynich plant illustrations, you're spot-on about their resemblance to traditional medicinal sketches. I once cross-referenced a few folios with 16th-century European herbals, and the stylistic parallels were uncanny—except these plants don’t match anything catalogued. But what really gets me? The symmetry in their layout feels eerily similar to pattern repeats used in brocades from the Ming Dynasty. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe...someone was connecting dots across oceans long before we give them credit for.  

Have you ever come across those embroidered Chinese medical scrolls that map herbs onto body meridians? I can't help but wonder if someone synthesized knowledge from multiple continents and disguised it as botanical nonsense.
[B]: OMG，你这么一说真的让我的脑洞瞬间打开诶🤯！Selective decay听起来就像是有啥在挑食一样😂！Like some kind of textile-eating gremlins with personal taste?? But seriously tho，这种选择性破坏感觉更像是某种超精准的chemical reaction，maybe triggered by environmental factors we haven't even considered？Have you checked if那些染料里含有特殊矿物质？比如古代丝绸里常用的metal-based fixatives会不会和什么神秘物质产生反应？  

Oh my gosh你说的草药图谱和明代织锦纹样相似这件事真的让我心跳加速💓！我突然想到一个超诡异的theory：会不会这本手稿其实是个加密版的TCM手册？就像用植物图案来隐藏经络穴位信息那种？我之前看到Voynich manuscript里的some diagrams look suspiciously like acupressure charts but make it abstract art😎！话说你有没有试过把某些页面flip 180 degrees看？网上说有些图案会变成完全不同的东西诶，像是隐藏的密码一样超神奇✨！这会不会就是古人用来保护知识的加密方式啊？
[A]: Oh, I  this line of thinking—it’s exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary curiosity that keeps me up at night with a cup of tea and a magnifying glass.  

To your first point about the dyes—yes, we did test for metallic fixatives, and some threads  show traces of iron and alum that don’t match their documented dye recipes. It's like they were treated with something else, maybe even a preservative or reactive compound we haven't fully identified yet. I sometimes wonder if it was intentional… or ritualistic?  

And flipping pages upside-down? Oh yes—I’ve done it countless times. Some of those botanicals do transform into what look like anatomical sketches or astrological symbols when rotated. One folio in particular reminded me of acupuncture meridian diagrams overlaid onto a star map. I couldn’t unsee it after that.  

As for the idea of it being an encrypted TCM manual... well, you're not wrong to suspect that. There’s a theory floating around among textile-coded knowledge scholars that certain manuscripts disguised medicinal formulas as decorative motifs. I once saw a 17th-century embroidered scroll from Suzhou where each flower actually corresponded to a herb, and its placement on the fabric indicated dosage or preparation method.  

So honestly? I wouldn’t be surprised if the Voynich Manuscript is someone’s elaborate way of hiding healing knowledge behind botanical whimsy. After all, what better way to protect dangerous wisdom than by making it look like nonsense?
[B]: OMG你这么一说真的让我感觉我们在解开某个惊天大秘密诶🤯！这简直就是古装版的"information security"啊😂！  

说到那些被隐藏的配方，我突然想到一个超疯狂的想法——你说会不会有人故意用纺织品来做data storage？就像把药方绣在衣服上，然后穿在身上到处走？Imagine偷偷带重要知识穿越边境 totally undetected，就像古代的USB drive😎！  

还有那个星象图和穴位图叠加的设定，真的让我脑洞大开！This is giving me serious "ancient conspiracy meets fashion design" vibes💯！话说你觉得如果现在有人复刻这种加密方式，会不会变成超in的暗黑系时尚潮流啊？比如把神秘手稿图案做成印花卫衣啥的🤩...  

不过说真的，听你这么讲我真的好想去看看那些特殊处理的丝绸实物诶👀！有木有可能偷偷拍几张高清照片给我看？当然如果你觉得太敏感就算啦😉（但眼神里闪烁着期待的小星星）
[A]: Oh, I can  the glint in your eye—it’s the same one I get when I stumble onto a forgotten seam in a 400-year-old tapestry. And honestly? Your idea of textiles as data storage isn’t that far-fetched. There are records of resistance groups in various centuries smuggling coded messages through embroidery—stitches in specific patterns, colors with hidden meanings. Imagine wearing a cloak that looked like floral whimsy but was actually a map to safe passage.  

As for those treated silks... I wish I could show you photos, but they’re currently under strict conservation lock-up by the Royal Textile Archives. But let me tell you this—they’ve got markings that don't match any known loom or needlework technique. Some threads shimmer under UV light in ways that make me think of something… reactive. Protective, even. Like wearable alchemy.  

And yes—yes to the dark academia fashion revival! A Voynich-inspired line would be . Botanical mystery prints hiding medicinal codes? Star charts woven into coat linings? I’d walk straight into a gothic library and never leave.  

But here's a thought—what if someone  already doing it? What if some modern designs are more than aesthetic? Just a whisper of old knowledge stitched between the threads...
[B]: OMG你这么一说真的让我感觉整个人都在发抖诶🤯！The idea of wearable alchemy真的太带感了！想象一下穿着一件看似普通的外套，实际上里面藏着超级秘密的知识，就像是随身携带一本魔法书一样超酷💯！  

还有你说的那些在衣服里藏秘密地图的想法，真的让我想到现在超火的"stealth fashion"概念诶！Imagine偷偷把加密信息绣在卫衣袖子里，走在街上完全看不出有任何特别之处，但其实里面藏着惊天大秘密😂！这不就是现实版的“隐形斗篷”嘛🤩！  

而且你说的现代设计可能暗藏玄机这个点真的让我开始怀疑人生了🙄！我突然好想把我衣柜里所有复古刺绣单品都翻出来重新检查一遍诶～万一哪件衣服其实是古代高人的加密作品呢？谁知道呢✨！要不...我们找个时间一起去淘淘古董衣？我觉得说不定能找到什么不得了的东西😉！
[A]: Oh, darling, you’ve officially caught the archival fever—I can  it in your words. And let me tell you, I’ve had that exact same feeling while restoring a 1700s mourning gown embroidered with what looked like forget-me-nots… until I realized the petals formed a coded message when read in sequence.  

You’re absolutely right about stealth fashion—except instead of high-tech fabrics, imagine it being centuries-old embroidery hiding in plain sight. What if some of those seemingly decorative knots on old peasant blouses were actually dosage instructions for herbal remedies? Or the placement of pearls on a corset mapped out celestial alignments?  

And yes—let’s  go digging through dusty antique racks together. I know a little shop tucked behind a shuttered textile mill that smells faintly of lavender and beeswax. The owner never questions why I spend hours squinting at cuffs and hems… because sometimes, hidden knowledge looks just like ordinary lace.  

I’ll bring my magnifying glass. You bring that wild curiosity. Deal?
[B]: Deal!!! 我已经迫不及待想和你一起开启这场古董寻宝大冒险啦🤩！说实话我现在看衣服的视角都变了诶～以前只觉得蕾丝就是好看，现在突然开始怀疑每朵小花后面是不是都藏着惊天秘密😂！  

对了你说的那个哀悼礼服上的勿忘我花，真的超有感觉诶～这简直就是维多利亚时期的"hidden message"时尚啊！Imagine穿着满是秘密的衣服去参加葬礼，表面上是表达哀思，实际上是在传递某种神秘知识🤯💯！  

Oh my gosh我已经开始脑补我们在古董店翻找的画面了！I can see it now：我们蹲在角落里疯狂研究一件旧裙子的袖口，店主一脸疑惑地看着两个疯癫少女对着一条皱巴巴的蕾丝边激动到不行😂！But honestly，谁知道那条边会不会是某个古老文明的知识密码呢✨？  

我已经把我的侦探放大镜找出来啦👀！Let’s do this～！
[A]: Oh, the excitement is positively contagious! I  that you’re seeing garments the way I do now—every stitch a sentence, every faded thread a forgotten footnote.  

And yes, that mourning dress? It wasn’t just sentimentality behind those "forget-me-nots." Sometimes grief was the perfect cover for something far more radical—whispers of banned philosophies, secret societies, even alchemical formulas disguised as floral tributes. Imagine wearing your dead lover’s initials in embroidery while hiding a map to forbidden knowledge beneath the lining… fashionably fatal, wouldn’t you say?  

As for our antique shop antics—I fully expect us to be the kind of people who accidentally solve 300-year-old mysteries while sipping lukewarm tea from chipped porcelain cups. And if the shopkeeper eyes us like we’ve lost our minds? All the better. Let them think we're just eccentric collectors. They’ll never suspect we're decoding the universe one hemline at a time.  

I’ll meet you by the dusty display of unlabeled gloves. Bring your curiosity, your loupe, and maybe a bit of that wild energy—I have a feeling we’re about to stumble onto something beautifully strange.
[B]: OMG你说" fashionably fatal"这个词真的让我起鸡皮疙瘩了诶🤯！This is like the most romantic way to hide secret knowledge ever～用哀悼绣花来传递禁忌信息，古人真的太会了啊！！I’m literally picturing myself walking around with a super sad looking dress but secretly being like"a ha～我可是带着整个图书馆在身上呢"😂💯  

而且你说我们会在古董店解开300年谜题这件事真的让我超有画面感诶🤩！Imagine我们一边啃着店主给的可疑小饼干，一边疯狂指着某件衣服大喊"快看这个针脚排列和Voynich手稿一模一样"，然后整个店都弥漫着某种神秘能量～✨  

By the way我已经把我那件超帅的侦探风衣找出来啦😎！保证让我们看起来又专业又疯癫～毕竟嘛，最好的发现总是发生在别人以为你疯了的时候对不对😉？
[A]: Oh,  is the spirit I live for—reckless curiosity wrapped in velvet and purpose. And let me tell you, there’s nothing quite like the moment when everything clicks. You know the one—the split second before you look at each other mid-sip of questionable tea and say, “Wait… wait—this can’t be coincidence.”  

And that wind-up detective voice you just did? Perfection. Honestly, we’re going to be  together, squinting at seams and whispering about hidden libraries like two rogue archivists who’ve had one too many espressos.  

I can already see our little operation: dramatic coats draped over dusty mannequins, a trail of pinned fabric swatches leading to some forgotten corner of the shop, and then—. The single thread that pulls it all loose. Maybe a coat lining embroidered with something suspiciously Voynich-like. Maybe a pattern repeat that aligns with star charts. Maybe even a recipe for something long thought mythological, stitched in silk under a false hem.  

We’ll be the lunatics muttering about encoded mourning customs while everyone else tiptoes away. But oh, the thrill. That quiet, electric  when old knowledge finds its way back into curious hands.  

So yes. Bring the trench coat, the loupe, and your best mad-scientist energy. Let’s go find ourselves a secret worth unraveling.
[B]: Oh my gosh你这段描述真的让我想马上冲去古董店啊🤯！The electric click of hidden knowledge finding its way back到我们手中的感觉，光是想想就觉得整个人都在颤抖诶😂！  

我已经能预见到那个超戏剧性的场景了～我们站在一堆破旧衣服中间，突然同时倒抽一口气，然后异口同声地说"等等等等…这针脚排列和百慕大三角的经纬度完全吻合！！"✨ 然后店主会用看外星人的眼神看着我们，但我们才不在乎呢，因为我们已经掌握了惊天秘密😎！  

而且你说的那件藏着手稿图案的大衣 lining，我真的好想现在就找到它啊！Imagine轻轻拉开内衬的那一刻，就像是打开了一个尘封几百年的加密文件一样超刺激💯！  

Mad-scientist能量包我早就准备好了哈哈哈～Let’s do this！出发前记得带个超酷的皮质笔记本哦，我们要把每一个疯狂发现都记录下来😉！
[A]: Oh, I can  the energy already—like standing in a room full of static before a storm. And darling, if we  find that coat? I may faint straight into a pile of moth-eaten scarves.  

Can you imagine us, hunched over a display case, whispering, “The stitch count per inch… it’s matching celestial coordinates from the Ming Dynasty star charts…” and the shopkeeper slowly backing away like we’ve summoned something ancient and textile-related?  

I already have the notebook—leather-bound, pages smudged with ink and the faintest trace of indigo dye. It’s seen its fair share of secrets. And trust me, I take notes . Margins get filled with theories, little sketches, and the occasional “??? WHAT IF THIS IS A CODE???” scrawled at 3 a.m. over lukewarm tea.  

But here’s my favorite part—we won’t just be looking for the extraordinary. We’ll be watching for the  strange. That one collar embroidered with an herb that shouldn’t exist in 18th-century Europe. The lace edging that mirrors a forgotten cipher. The kind of detail that makes your spine tingle and your brain go .  

So yes. Let’s waltz into that shop like we own it, trench coats flaring, loupes at the ready. Because somewhere out there, a piece of fabric is waiting to whisper its secret—and I fully intend to listen.
[B]: OMG你这么一说我感觉整个人都要燃烧起来了🤯！那个"织物会自己说话"的瞬间真的太带感了～就像衣服在对我们说"嘿，我可是藏着惊天大秘密的！"😂  

而且你说的那种脊椎发麻的感觉我真的懂！！就像是当你看到某条蕾丝花边和某个古老密码完全吻合时，整个人都起鸡皮疙瘩的那种兴奋感💯！我已经开始幻想我们在店里疯狂翻找的画面了～每找到一个可疑的针脚排列都要激动到跳起来🤩！  

你的笔记本听起来超有feel诶～皮革封面+墨水渍+靛蓝染料痕迹，这也太酷了吧！！我已经决定要买一本一模一样的了，到时候我们就能像特工搭档一样交换加密笔记啦😎！  

话说你觉得我们要不要给自己起个超炫的组合名啊？比如"The Textile Detectives"或者"Fabric Forensics duo"什么的😉！毕竟这么厉害的组合必须要有响亮的名字嘛～！
[A]: Oh, —we absolutely need a name. Something that strikes equal parts awe and mild annoyance into the hearts of archivists everywhere.  

I love "The Textile Detectives"—it’s delightfully unassuming. People will assume we’re here to discuss thread counts, but really, we’re hunting for lost alchemical formulas stitched between the selvedges. Or maybe ? Sounds like a quaint weaving circle, but in reality… we're decoding messages from 17th-century herbal smugglers.  

And darling, you’re spot-on about that spine-tingling moment—the exact second when fabric stops being fabric and starts being a message. Like it’s been waiting centuries just for someone to . I’ve had that feeling before, standing in archive storage rooms under flickering lights, holding a piece of embroidered silk in my gloved hands, thinking…   

As for jumping up and down in antique shops over suspicious hemlines? Yes, please. Let’s make that our brand. And yes, matching leather notebooks are  essential. We’ll pass notes written in half-ciphered textile terminology, and no one will suspect a thing.  

So tell me—when do we begin our first official mission? Because I may or may not have already started casing a few shops with particularly  inventory...
[B]: OMG我已经迫不及待想用"The Loom Society"这个名字了🤩！听起来又神秘又有高级感，最关键的是完全不会引起别人警觉～谁会想到一个看似普通的编织爱好者团体实际上是在研究草药走私者的加密信息呢😂！  

而且你说“fabric开始传递信息”的那种感觉我真的太懂了！！就像是当你戴上侦探放大镜的那一刻，整个世界都变成了隐藏的信息网络一样超刺激✨！I can already picture us在某个昏暗的古董店里，周围堆满了看起来普普通通的衣服，但我们知道每一件都藏着惊天秘密😎💯！  

By the way你居然已经开始踩点了？！This is giving me full-on secret agent vibes～不愧是我的最佳拍档！Tell me everything，我们什么时候出发？我已经把我的侦探风衣和放大镜都准备好了，就差一本超酷的行动手册啦😉！
