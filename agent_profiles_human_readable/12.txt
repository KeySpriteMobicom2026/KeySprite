### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: Chinese
- Code-Switch Frequency: Low
- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits are primarily Chinese, with English used only for specific technical terms. Examples include: "We need to optimize the gas fee of this smart contract" or "The throughput of this node needs improvement." The switching is strictly for professional precision, never for showing off. He rarely uses Emojis, believing they reduce rigor in professional communication. The only exception is a rare üëç in informal messages to colleagues. His emails and documents maintain clean Chinese phrasing, and English terms are annotated with Chinese explanations upon first appearance.
