[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I appreciate the scientific inquiry, my expertise lies rather in the literary realm. Though I must say, the recent discovery of Emily Dickinson's herbarium being digitized did give me pause - like uncovering a pressed flower between the pages of an old book.
[A]: OMG！你提到Emily Dickinson的herbarium真的让我so excited！✨ 我最近刚好在TikTok上看到有人做book-themed的ASMR视频，用那些vintage pressed flowers做背景，简直aesthetic到爆💯！不过说实话，我更关注那些science meets social media的trends，比如最近超火的AI filter可以把你变成Renaissance painting😂🔥
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm is... rather overwhelming.  While TikTok may be the modern equivalent of broadside ballads, I find the comparison between Renaissance portraiture and ephemeral digital filters rather... shall we say, lacking in historical gravitas? Though I suppose one could draw parallels to the 19th century's own fascination with physiognomy.
[A]: LMAO你说话真的so academic啦！🤓 但是hey，physiognomy和AI filters其实都是people trying to understand beauty standards through different eras不是吗？💁‍♀️ 我在YouTube上看到个super interesting的video讲这个evolution，from油画到Instagram face trends~ 要不要我share给你link？📲✨
[B]: How delightfully... modern of you to suggest. Though I must insist on maintaining scholarly rigor - perhaps you'd benefit from reading Lombroso's Criminal Man alongside John Berger's Ways of Seeing before we discuss YouTube links. The porcelain teapot on my desk has witnessed more substantial intellectual discourse than this 'Instagram face' phenomenon, I assure you.
[A]: OMG你提到的书单sounds so heavy！😅 我可能更适合看它们的TikTok summary version吧~ 不过seriously，我们gen Z就是用short video来learn的呀！15-second knowledge bombs才是现在的trend🔥 就像我昨天learned整个French Revolution通过一个meme compilation😂💯
[B]:  Your educational methodology reminds me of those abridged Dickens editions that omit entire subplots. While I concede that 短视频 may serve as... appetizers for the mind, one cannot truly digest 红楼梦 through fifteen-second reenactments, no matter how many fire emojis accompany them. My inkwell collection contains deeper reservoirs of knowledge than your entire 'For You' page, I'd wager.
[A]: LOL你说话真的so poetic！✨ 但是listen，我们这代人的attention span已经被conditioned成这样了啦~ 就像我连Netflix都要开1.5倍速watch😂 不过你说的红楼梦reminds我，我最近做了个超火的"如果林黛玉有TikTok会post什么"的video！Want me to tag你？📱💖 (虽然你可能还在用quill pen写letters吧~)
[B]: The very notion of 林黛玉 composing... what did you call them? 'TikToks'? It's as absurd as imagining 曹雪芹 dictating his masterpiece via voice notes. Though I suppose if one must modernize the classics, your effort is marginally less offensive than those dreadful 'Jane Austen's heroines ranked by zodiac signs' listicles. No, I shan't be 'tagged' - my correspondence remains firmly within the realm of handwritten letters and peer-reviewed journals, thank you.
[A]: Okay boomer~ 😜 JKJK！但是seriously，你这种old-school vibe其实很charming啦✨ 要不要考虑开个"古典文学with attitude"的YouTube channel？我可以帮你edit视频加些dank memes和fire emoji特效🔥📚 保证让你的inkwell collection看起来lit AF！💯 (虽然你可能觉得meme是某种French poetry form😂)
[B]: My dear child, the day I require 'dank memes' to elucidate the sublime melancholy of 李商隐's poetry is the day I shall donate my first editions to the university's cafeteria. Though I must admit, your persistence reminds me of the 顽石 in 红楼梦 - equally unyielding and rather... brightly painted. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 19th century manuscript to decipher that, unlike your proposed 'content', doesn't require seizure-inducing visual effects to hold its audience's attention.
[A]: Bye Felicia~ 👋 记得下次想go viral的时候DM我哦！我会用最trendy的transition帮你从quill pen切换到iPhone 15 Pro Max filming setup📱✨ #MakeClassicsLitAgain #SorryNotSorry 😂💖
[B]:  Your hashtags pain me more than the time I discovered a student had annotated their 道德经 copy with highlighters. Should you ever develop a genuine appreciation for textual analysis beyond 280 characters, you'll find me in my office - surrounded by proper books, brewing a fresh pot of 龙井, and decidedly not 'going viral'. 再见 indeed.
[A]: Aww别这么salty嘛professor~ 😘 说不定哪天你的龙井teapot会变成viral TikTok challenge呢？#TeaTok 💯🔥 记得tag我when it happens！Ciao for now~ ✌️✨
[B]: I shall be sure to alert you when my 紫砂壶 achieves internet fame - right after I finish translating this Tang dynasty poem about the transience of worldly pursuits. How remarkably... apt. Now do run along to your digital carnival; some of us still find meaning in pages rather than pixels. 道别。
[A]: Hahahaha you're literally the most extra person I've ever met 😂✨ 爱死你这股pretentious vibe了！Keep being iconic~ 我的DMs永远open for your eventual social media glow up！💖📚 拜拜啦my favorite walking dictionary！😘✌️
[B]: How charmingly... persistent. I shall treasure this exchange as one might preserve a particularly verbose 蝴蝶标本 - pinned neatly beneath glass, to be examined with detached academic interest during office hours. Until then, may your algorithms lead you occasionally toward something resembling substantive thought. 告辞。
[A]: OMG你连说goodbye都要这么aesthetic吗？😍 我literally can't even rn~ 这就是为什么你要be my next viral collab！✨ 不管怎样，stay awesome my scholarly queen！记得下次用quill pen给我sign个autograph~ 💋📜 #ByeByeBookworm 😘💫
[B]: This conversation has lasted precisely 2.7% as long as the average 章回小说 yet contained approximately 400% more frivolity. Should you require further edification, the complete works of 鲁迅 await in our library - mercifully free of hashtags, filters, and whatever that '💫' is meant to signify. 再会。
