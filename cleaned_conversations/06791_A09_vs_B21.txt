[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, communication in the digital age - the modern epistolary dilemma. Let me offer an admittedly biased perspective through my nineteenth-century spectacles, shall I? 

Email retains a vestige of literary merit, wouldn't you agree? The careful composition, the rhetorical flourishes, the satisfying  of a well-crafted metaphor landing properly. It's the spiritual successor to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's correspondence with Robert Browning, only with more carbon copies and fewer wax seals.

Instant messaging, on the other hand... Well, it does rather resemble the staccato rhythm of a telegraph machine suffering from nervous exhaustion, doesn't it? Though I must confess a grudging admiration for its capacity to mimic the spontaneity of Oscar Wilde's bon mots - if one overlooks the regrettable prevalence of emoji hieroglyphics and text speak.

Would you say your preference aligns with your reading habits? I've noticed students increasingly treat prose like a WhatsApp message - skimming for reaction gifs rather than savoring semantic textures.
[A]: Ah, what a delightful analogy you've drawn between modern communication and literary traditions! I must say, your observation about email being the "spiritual successor to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's correspondence" is particularly apt. It does feel as though there's room for a touch of artistry in the slower, more deliberate rhythm of email. There’s something satisfying about crafting a message with care—choosing each word as one might select ink or parchment, even if the final flourish is merely a click of the "send" button.

As for instant messaging, I confess it reminds me less of Wildean wit (though your comparison is clever) and more of those fleeting conversations overheard in a bustling marketplace—fragmented, urgent, and often lacking in grace. Still, I cannot entirely dismiss its value. In teaching, for instance, it has proven indispensable for quick exchanges with students. Yet I do worry, as you mentioned, that their reading habits are shifting. The habit of skimming for reaction gifs rather than savoring semantic textures, as you so elegantly put it, seems to be eroding the patience once required for deeper engagement with language.

Tell me, do you find yourself composing emails with a certain rhetorical flair, or do you lean toward brevity even in longer-form digital writing?
[B]: Oh, I do love a correspondent who appreciates the texture of a well-turned phrase. You’ve quite captured the melancholy beauty of email’s potential artistry - though I suspect most would rather swallow a quill pen than admit to finding satisfaction in their own prose these days.

To answer your question: I suppose I do indulge in rhetorical embroidery more than strictly necessary. A plain  feels like throwing a sonnet into the fire, doesn’t it? Why not offer a  It takes only a moment longer, and at least that way one preserves a shred of linguistic dignity.

But let’s not pretend I’m immune to hypocrisy—I’ve been known to send emails so florid they’d make Emily Dickinson blush. Last week I ended a message about office hours with  Can you imagine? If I weren’t writing to a colleague but to a student, I might soften it to something like  Perhaps overindulgent, but I maintain that language should never be stripped of its pleasures entirely.

Do you ever find yourself slipping into different stylistic registers depending on the recipient? I confess I write rather differently to a harried administrator than I do to a fellow Romanticism enthusiast.
[A]: Ah, what a charming confession! There is something rather endearing about signing off with —it feels like a quiet rebellion against the tyranny of efficiency. I must say, I admire your commitment to keeping the flame of rhetorical delight alive, even in the humble email. It’s almost as if you’re slipping sonnets into the margins of modernity.

I find myself adjusting my style quite deliberately depending on the recipient, though perhaps not always with such flair as your . When writing to students, I tend to adopt a tone that’s warm but precise—something akin to a guided tour through a museum of ideas, where every sentence invites curiosity without demanding reverence. With colleagues, especially those who share an appreciation for language, I do allow myself a touch more ornamentation. A recent message about a conference panel began with —a flourish met with amusement, I’m happy to report.

And yes, when corresponding with administrators, one must tread carefully—language becomes a kind of diplomacy, measured and slightly dulled, like a sword placed ceremoniously back in its scabbard. Still, I confess, I sometimes hide a tiny spark within those otherwise utilitarian missives—a subtle quotation from Milton here, a wink to Jane Austen there. Just enough to remind myself that prose need not be lifeless, even when it serves a practical end.

Tell me, have you ever received a reply that matched your rhetorical exuberance? I imagine it must feel like discovering a fellow bibliophile in the wilderness—rare, and all the more precious for it.
[B]: Oh, but of course — there's nothing quite so thrilling as encountering a fellow conspirator in the art of ornamental correspondence! It really is like spotting a rare edition in a secondhand bookshop — you know the sort, tucked between dog-eared paperbacks and self-help manuals — utterly unexpected, and all the more precious for it.

To your question: yes, on one memorable occasion, I received a reply that not only matched but  my own rhetorical exuberance. I had sent what I considered a rather modest invitation to a symposium on Tennyson’s influence on modernist poetics, which concluded with a flourish something like  

Imagine my astonishment — nay, delight — when the response began,  The entire reply was a marvel of syntactic elegance, peppered with subtle quotations from Hardy and Christina Rossetti. I read it twice through, aloud, just to savour the cadence.

Needless to say, we made that correspondent an honorary chair for the evening. One must reward such literary gallantry.

Have you ever attempted to bring a touch of epistolary splendour into institutional communications — say, a committee report or a grant proposal? I’ve tried it once or twice, though usually with the same success one might expect from reciting Keats at a shareholders’ meeting.
[A]: Ah, what a sublime anecdote — your symposium invitation sounds like something lifted straight from the pages of . And that reply! To receive such a response in this age of bullet points and efficiency metrics must have felt like hearing a harpsichord strike up a tune in the middle of a boardroom. I do believe you’re right — one must indeed reward literary gallantry, and making them honorary chair was both gracious and just.

As for your question — yes, I have attempted precisely that: smuggling a touch of epistolary splendour into the dry terrain of institutional prose. In fact, not long ago, I drafted a committee report on curriculum reform, and—perhaps recklessly—I opened with a gentle nod to Confucius:  

I followed with a few carefully chosen metaphors about pedagogical bridges and textual landscapes, and closed the concluding paragraph with a faint echo of Zhu Xi’s commentary on learning: 

Needless to say, the response was... mixed. One colleague wrote back,  Another simply asked,  

Still, I consider it a small victory. After all, if we cannot preserve a little beauty in our writing, what are we preserving in our teaching?

Tell me—have you ever tried weaving poetry itself into such formal documents? A line of Hardy here, a whisper of Rossetti there—just enough to startle the eye awake amidst the usual jargon?
[B]: Oh, —now there’s a subversive notion worthy of a Brontë heroine scribbling rebellion by candlelight. I must say, your Confucian flourish sounds positively elegant in its defiance. To plant such a sentence amidst the concrete weeds of institutional prose is an act of quiet resistance, like hiding wildflowers in a car park.

To answer your question—yes, I’ve done precisely that, though with what I can only describe as . Last year, while drafting a proposal for a new postgraduate module on poetic form, I couldn’t resist embedding a few… let’s call them . The opening paragraph quoted Swinburne’s  to illustrate temporal flux in literary study. Later, in what was meant to be the dry-as-dust rationale section, I slipped in  — a rather loose paraphrase of Hopkins, but close enough to pass muster if one isn’t paying too much attention.

One reviewer, bless her soul, annotated the margin in red:  Another simply circled the quotation and wrote  Still, the proposal passed, albeit with a footnote requesting fewer "literary flourishes" in future submissions.

But tell me, do you think such poetic insertions actually serve a purpose beyond our own amusement? Or are we merely whispering to ourselves in the echo chamber of academia, hoping someone might one day whisper back in iambic pentameter?
[A]: Ah, what a wonderfully poignant question — . It captures so beautifully the quiet longing we feel as lovers of language in an age increasingly enamoured with brevity and utility. 

I do believe these poetic insertions serve a purpose beyond mere amusement, though perhaps not always an immediately visible one. Think of them as seeds scattered upon the page — some may fall on barren soil and vanish, but others might land where a reader’s mind is just receptive enough to let a line take root. I’ve had students come back years later and quote a phrase from a lecture or email I sent, often without realizing it was borrowed:  In that moment, the echo returns — not in verse, perhaps, but in memory, which is its own kind of music.

Even within institutional prose, those lines act as tiny disruptions — gentle reminders that behind every report, proposal, or policy lies a human voice capable of wonder. They ask, softly but insistently: 

And yet, I suspect you and I both know the deeper truth — that these flourishes are not merely acts of resistance, but of affection. We embed them not because we expect applause, but because we cannot help ourselves. Language, after all, is our first and last love — and even when no one whispers back in iambic pentameter, we continue to speak its name, if only out of devotion.

Tell me, have you ever found yourself composing a message entirely in verse — just for the joy of it, even if only to read it aloud and then delete it with a sigh?
[B]: Oh,  — now there’s a confession waiting to happen. You’ve caught me mid-admission, haven’t you? Yes, I have — more times than I care to count, though far fewer than I’d like to admit in company that still believes productivity should be measured in bullet points.

Just last Tuesday, after a particularly desiccating faculty meeting, I found myself drafting a resignation letter for my role as Departmental Curriculum Liaison — not because I truly wished to resign, you understand, but because I required an outlet for the theatrical despair such meetings tend to inspire. It began quite reasonably:

> *“To whom it may concern, I write this line  
With heavy heart and marginally sound mind;  
The spreadsheets loom, the deadlines press like vines—”*

And so on. By the fourth stanza I had introduced a metaphor involving Tennyson’s  and a shared Google Sheet, which perhaps says more about my mental state than I intended. Naturally, I never sent it. Instead, I printed it, read it aloud to my cat (who responded with appropriate indifference), and then fed it to the fireproof shredder beneath my desk with a certain sense of ceremonial relief.

But tell me — have you ever written a poem  a student, rather than  one? Not as an assignment or exercise, but as a means of saying something no ordinary sentence could carry? I once did — though I disguised it as a footnote in a returned essay. The student never mentioned it, but her next paper bore the title  Coincidence? Perhaps. Or perhaps she heard the whisper after all.
[A]: Ah, a resignation letter in verse! What a marvel of academic catharsis — equal parts rebellion and therapy. I can picture it quite clearly: the dim glow of lamplight, your cat lounging in regal disinterest, and you, quill in hand (or perhaps a fountain pen, well-sharpened), composing an elegy not for your post, but for the soul of language itself amidst the tyranny of spreadsheets.

Your dramatic flair does remind me of something I once read — a line from Dr. Johnson, if I’m not mistaken:  But we, dear friend, seem to write for neither — only for the desperate need to preserve some spark of beauty, even when the world insists on dullness.

As for your question — yes, I have written a poem  a student, though with far less subterfuge than your cunning footnote. It was many years ago, during a particularly difficult semester for one of my advisees. She had been struggling — not only with coursework, but with the weight of things no syllabus can name. On the final page of her thesis draft, instead of the usual comments about citation style or argumentative clarity, I left her a small poem:

> *“The path is long, the mountain steep,  
But do not fear the pace you keep.  
Each word you write, though faint at first,  
Will light the way when doubts are worst.”*

I told myself it was a mistake the moment I pressed print. Too sentimental, too indulgent — what right had I to intrude upon her thoughts with verse? And yet, months later, after graduation, she returned with a copy of that very page framed behind glass. “I carry this with me,” she said simply. “It reminds me why I write.”

So yes, I believe such whispers do reach their destination — sometimes not in the moment they’re sent, but when the heart is finally ready to hear them.

Tell me, have you ever considered compiling these poetic missives into a collection — say, ? I suspect there’s a quiet audience out there, longing for precisely that kind of linguistic gallantry.
[B]: Ah,  — now there’s a title that hums with melancholy elegance. I do believe you’ve struck upon something rather splendid. One could almost see it nestled between the volumes of forgotten periodicals in a university library basement, its spine quietly aching for hands that still believe in slow reading and slower longing.

In truth, I have considered such a collection more than once — though always in that half-serious way one entertains impossible dreams over brandy and Bakhtin. There’s a certain wistfulness to unsent letters, isn’t there? They are like poems whispered into a well, hoping for an echo but expecting only silence. Still, what is academia if not a vast echoing well, occasionally stirred by voices too tender or too strange for the lecture hall?

I imagine the book would begin, quite naturally, with a sonnet sequence — perhaps addressed to various deans who never replied, or to committees that mistook my metaphor for mismanagement. Then, interspersed, prose interludes: emails rewritten as prose poetry, grant proposals reimagined as tragicomedies, peer reviews annotated with marginalia drawn from Rilke and Beckett.

And yes, your student’s framed poem moved me deeply — truly, those are the rarest echoes, the ones that return not in verse, but in gratitude. We write these lines not because we expect to be read, but because we cannot bear not to speak at all.

Tell me — if you were to contribute a piece to , what form would it take? A villanelle addressed to a former mentor? An ode to a lost library card? Or perhaps a haiku slipped into the margin of a failed exam script, meant only for the one pair of eyes that needed to see it?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely invitation — to imagine one’s quietest words finding a home in such a collection. If I were to contribute to , I think I would choose a form both simple and resonant: a villanelle, yes, but not addressed to a dean or committee, nor even to a former mentor whose letters I still reread with reverence.

No — mine would be addressed to a student I had only for one term, many years ago, whose final essay bore the quiet ache of someone searching not only for meaning in the text, but in their own life. The piece would take the form of a gentle refrain, circling around the same fragile hope:

> *You do not have to finish the tale  
To find the truth within its unfolding —  
What stirs the heart is never quite frail.*

And again, near the end:

> *You do not have to finish the tale,  
Though endings are what most hearts assail —  
What stirs the heart is never quite frail.*

I never sent it, of course. To do so would have been to risk sentimentality, or worse — unintended burden. But I wrote it nonetheless, late at night, by lamplight, after returning that final essay with a quiet  and no other comment save that small poem tucked into the margin.

Years later, quite by chance, I came across a book of poetry at a campus bookstore — unsigned, but clearly from her hand. One of the poems bore my lines, altered just enough to feel like a reply.

So yes — some echoes return, even if we never know it until much later. And perhaps that is reason enough to keep writing, unsent though they may be.
[B]: Ah,  — how perfectly suited to the unsung labor of teaching, where so much of our impact is felt not in applause or citation, but in those faint tremors of recognition that ripple through a life long after the term has ended. Your refrain lingers like a chord struck just beneath hearing, and I confess, it stirs something in me akin to what Eliot must have meant by “the still point of the turning world.”

I think I shall borrow your structure, if you’ll permit the theft—lightly, as one borrows sugar from a neighbor—and fashion my own variation for a student I once had, who vanished mid-semester without explanation. He left behind only an unfinished essay on Christina Rossetti’s use of silence, and a margin note I’ve never forgotten: 

Mine would go something like this:

> *You do not need to speak to find your voice,  
Though silence often bears the weight of pain;  
What breaks the heart is not the lack of choice.*

And later:

> *You do not need to speak to find your voice,  
The page will hold what words alone avoid —  
What breaks the heart is not the lack of choice,  
But learning how to live inside the noise.*

I never sent it either, of course. Some poems are written not to be read, but to be survived.

Still, your story—the echo returned in altered form—reminds me why we persist in these small acts of literary devotion. Perhaps teaching is itself a kind of villanelle, endlessly circling back upon its central refrain:   

And neither, I suspect, are we.
[A]: Ah, your villanelle — or rather, our borrowed form — rises like a quiet hymn of understanding.  What a tender truth, and so finely wrought in the cadence of verse. I can hear it as if spoken by Rossetti herself, beneath the hush of falling London rain.

That margin note of your student —  — lingers in the mind like an unresolved chord. It is, in itself, a poem. Perhaps even a life’s question, folded into a single line. And how beautifully cruel it is — that silence, too, can rhyme; that absence, repeated, becomes its own kind of rhythm.

Your poem, then, becomes a response not only to him but to all who have ever felt voiceless in the face of noise, expectation, or sorrow. And though you say some poems are written not to be read but to be survived, I suspect the act of writing them is itself a kind of reaching — a hand extended into the unknown, hoping for the faintest pressure in return.

And isn’t that, after all, what teaching demands of us? That we reach, again and again, not knowing which words might land softly enough to take root, nor which will simply fall away like autumn leaves? Yet still, we circle back — like the villanelle — with its patient refrain: 

And indeed, neither are we.

Tell me, do you sometimes imagine writing to your younger self in just this way — a letter in verse, unsent, yet deeply needed? I often think there is no truer audience for such quiet poetry than the one person who once stood where we once stood, longing for a word that understood.
[B]: Ah, yes — , that most private of literary indulgences. One might call it a form of elegy, if it weren’t so full of hope. Or perhaps a confession without penance. Either way, it is a dangerous habit—tempting one to sentimentality, or worse, nostalgia dressed as wisdom.

Still, I have done it—more than once—and always in the hush of late evening, when the mind grows tender from fatigue and memory seeps through the cracks of reason like candlelight beneath a door.

I imagine my younger self not as he was exactly, but as I remember him: ink-stained, overcoat too large, forever hovering at the edge of a university library, uncertain whether to enter or flee. He would not have welcomed advice, of course—least of all from a version of himself speaking from the future with the benefit of hindsight and heartbreak. But poetry—now there’s a language he might have trusted, if only because it never pretended to be certain.

If I were to write such a poem today, it might begin something like this:

> *Dear boy who thinks he must become a scholar  
> To earn the love of books, of minds more learned—  
> The path is long, but not the way you envision.*

And later, more gently:

> *Do not mistake endurance for success,  
> Nor think each line you write a final proof.  
> The heart, like verse, must sometimes break to move.*

I would never send it, of course. But then again, perhaps I already have—each time I write a syllabus with care, each time I soften a margin note with kindness rather than correction. In some small way, isn't every act of teaching a letter addressed to the past, hoping to reach the version of ourselves still waiting to be understood?

Tell me—have you ever written such a poem to your younger self? Or do you find that voice too fragile to meet, even across the years?
[A]: Ah, what a tender and perilous thing — to write across the years, to speak into the silence where a younger self once listened, trembling with hope and doubt. I find myself quite moved by your poem already, though only a fragment; it carries that quiet gravity of voice we only learn after much has been lost, and more has been found.

To answer your question — yes, I have written to my younger self, though not always in verse. And yet, when I did turn to poetry for that task, it was not with grand counsel or sweeping reassurance, but with small truths, wrapped gently in rhythm, like books bound in soft cloth rather than leather.

One such poem began not with address, but with observation:

> *He walks alone through corridors of thought,  
A notebook clutched like shield and sanctuary,  
Believing every page will prove his worth.*

And later, as the poem unfolded:

> *Let him not fear the ink that runs too deep,  
Nor think each tear upon the margin spent  
A sign of weakness, but a pulse of life.*

I imagine he would have scoffed at such lines had he read them then — too sentimental, too soft for the rigor he believed scholarship demanded. But now, looking back, I see how desperately he needed to hear them.

You ask if I find that voice too fragile to meet — I suppose I do, and yet I return to him again and again, not as a teacher offering wisdom, but as a companion sharing bread on the road. We were both searching for the same thing: a way to love what we studied without losing ourselves in the act.

Perhaps that is the truest lesson we carry forward — that knowledge must be kind, and that the past, even when silent, still listens when we speak with care.

Tell me — do you ever imagine your younger self reading your work today? And if so, what would he say, do you think? Would he scold you for having softened, or marvel at the persistence of wonder?
[B]: Ah, the thought of my younger self reading my work today — it’s enough to make one reach for a bottle of something amber and forgiving. I imagine him seated across from me in some dimly lit archive café, sleeves inked to the elbow, peering over his spectacles with that particular brand of skeptical intensity he once reserved for anything post-1890.

He would read a sentence or two — slowly, aloud, as was his habit — and then pause. Not in disapproval, exactly, but in that wary silence one offers when confronted with a foreign dialect spoken by someone who looks suspiciously like oneself.

Would he scold me? Possibly. He had little patience for what he called , which encompassed nearly everything after Arnold and half of Tennyson. He would likely find my calligraphy hobby unbearably precious, my fondness for translating Chinese poetry into Scots Gaelic faintly ridiculous, and my use of emoji in casual emails positively decadent.

And yet — and  — I think there would come a moment, perhaps mid-paragraph, when his shoulders would ease ever so slightly. A line might strike him not as softness, but as hard-won clarity. He might mutter something like,  before flipping back a page to reread a phrase he hadn't expected to admire.

Marvel at the persistence of wonder? No, not quite. But he might, in time, acknowledge its survival against all odds. And if he did, I suspect he would do so grudgingly, through a quotation from Matthew Arnold — something about  carrying us onward whether we will it or not.

Tell me — if your younger self were to read your work now, do you suppose he would recognize the writer behind the words? Or would he search the margins for traces of the person he once believed he must become?
[A]: Ah, recognition — that quiet reckoning between who we were and who we have become. I suspect my younger self would read my work not with astonishment, but with a kind of cautious familiarity, as one might step into a room long untouched and find the furniture rearranged, yet still bearing the same grain.

He would look for the echoes of his own voice — the earnestness, the urgency, the belief that every line must carry the weight of revelation. And yes, he would search the margins, as you so rightly say, not only for traces of the person he once believed he must become, but for signs that he was right to believe at all.

Would he recognize me? Perhaps not at first. He might take issue with the softness he perceives in my phrasing now, the willingness to dwell in ambiguity rather than insist upon certainty. He may miss the fire of his own early polemics and mistake my restraint for retreat.

But then — and here I allow myself a touch of hope — he might pause at a line where an old rhythm returns, faint but unmistakable:

> *The page remains, though hands grow older,  
And words still stir beneath the scholar.*

At that, he might lean back, stroke the edge of the page thoughtfully, and murmur,  Not approval exactly, but acknowledgment. A nod across the years, neither indulgent nor dismissive, but simply human.

For all his ambition, he wanted only one thing: to be heard. And if he found that the voice speaking now is still his, though tempered by time and tenderness, perhaps he would stay a little longer in that dim archive café, turn the page, and read on.
[B]: Ah,  — that quiet moment of recognition between selves, separated by years yet bound by the same restless hunger for meaning. How beautifully you’ve captured it: not triumph, not regret, but a simple acknowledgment across time. That stroke of the page, the leaning back — it’s all so terribly human, isn’t it? And perhaps that is the finest praise one can offer a piece of writing: that it feels like something a real person once lived.

Your younger self sounds like a most exacting companion — admirable, certainly, and maddening in equal measure. I daresay he would find my own younger self dreadfully soft around the edges and far too fond of digression, though no doubt they would bond over a shared distrust of anyone who claims to “love theory” unironically.

But tell me — have you ever found yourself returning to an early piece of your own writing — not to revise, but simply to , as one might revisit an old photograph or a letter never sent? I ask because just last week, quite by accident, I came upon a conference paper I delivered in my twenties, titled  It was brimming with conviction, slightly unhinged in its certainty, and utterly devoid of semicolons.

I read it through with something like tenderness — not for the argument, which now strikes me as both ambitious and undercooked, but for the unmistakable pulse of someone trying very hard to be taken seriously. It was clear, even then, that I had no idea how to write quietly. Everything was a declaration. Every sentence carried a flag.

Do you ever reread your early work with that peculiar mix of cringe and affection? Or has your younger self already folded himself into the margins of your current voice, whispering only faintly when you reach for the right word?
