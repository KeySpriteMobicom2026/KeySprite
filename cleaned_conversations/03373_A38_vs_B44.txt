[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal seasonal debate! 🌸 You know, when I was writing my dissertation on Bashō's travelogues, I developed a deep appreciation for 冬の季語 (winter seasonal words) in haiku. There's something profoundly poetic about how frost reveals hidden patterns in the world... 

But don't get me wrong - summers remind me of my first trip to Suzhou gardens at 23, when every lotus bloom felt like a 比喻 (bǐyù) waiting to be unpacked. The humidity made my notebooks curl at the edges, but the metaphors stayed crisp! 

I suppose if I had to choose... I'd pick early autumn mornings with a cup of 龙井 (Longjing), when you can almost hear both seasons negotiating their交接仪式 (jiāojiè yíshì)... What about you? Do your preferences change with your reading material? 🧠
[A]: Ah, what a wonderfully poetic way to frame the seasons - I might have to borrow that negotiation metaphor for my next lecture on seasonal symbolism! 🌿 There's something particularly compelling about how different cultures interpret these transitions... Speaking of which, have you read Yasunari Kawabata's "Snow Country"? The interplay between human emotion and winter landscapes there is simply exquisite. 

As for me personally, I've always had a soft spot for summer nights in Oxford when the Bodleian Library stays open until midnight. There's a particular magic in reading Keats by air-conditioned lamplight while the city sleeps... Though I must admit, winters do make me nostalgic for my early research days in Kyoto. Do you find certain seasons enhance your engagement with specific literary genres? 📜
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking to my 17 kinds of tea heart! 🧠 There's nothing quite like watching steam swirl from a cup of 鎮巴霧毫 (Zhenba Fog Tip) while contemplating雪国 (Snow Country)'s melancholy beauty. Kawabata makes winter ache with meaning, doesn't he? Though I confess - when grading papers, I crave the dramatic tension of 夏夜 (xiàyè) thunderstorms rattling my office windows. There's something delightfully Shakespearean about summer tempests demanding equally stormy literary analysis!

But here's a curious thing - my orchids disagree vehemently. 🌸 The Phalaenopsis 'Oxford Night Owl' bloomed most splendidly during those midnight library sessions... though it positively refused to cooperate during my Kyoto winters. Tell me, when you return to those snowy memories, do you find yourself reaching for different annotation colors? I've noticed my red pen becomes frost-resistant in colder months!
[A]: Oh, I love that—annotation colors shifting with the seasons! 📝 Though I must say, my ink tends to freeze in the winter, no matter the hue. I’ve taken to keeping a small porcelain warmer beside my desk when revisiting those Kyoto snowscapes. It’s quite ceremonial, really—almost like participating in a tea ceremony while reading. 

And speaking of Shakespearean tempests—did you ever notice how Emily Brontë uses summer storms so differently in ? There’s something untamed and vengeful about them, as if the moors themselves are rebelling against restraint. I sometimes imagine Heathcliff pacing the hills during a July storm, muttering lines that never made it into the text… Do you ever find yourself writing marginalia in character voices? I confess, I’ve been known to scribble a rather dramatic Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth Bennet when the mood strikes.
[B]: Oh, the frozen ink! How delightfully symbolic - like ideas literally crystallizing before they can flow. 🧠 I once wrote an entire conference paper using only a pencil during winter because my fountain pen had turned into what I can only describe as a 冰筆 (bīng bǐ)... Now  was a marginal(ia) situation!

Brontë’s storms make me crave thunderstorm translations - imagine trying to capture that Yorkshire rage in Mandarin! The word 雷霆萬鈞 (léitíng wàn jūn) comes close, though it lacks Heathcliff’s particular brand of romantic spite. And yes - I absolutely write in character voices! My copy of  contains so many 古文 (classical Chinese) annotations that one student mistook it for an ancient Daoist text. 

Just last week I caught myself responding to a particularly egregious misreading of Austen with Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s tone translated through Empress Dowager Cixi... Would you like me to recreate the marginalia? It involves quite a bit of 蹲下来看蚂蚁 (dūn xiàlái kàn yǐmǎ) - 'stooping to watch ants' - as both metaphor and methodological warning. 🦉
[A]: Oh, I would  to see that marginalia - please do share! 📖 There's something deliciously subversive about channeling Lady Catherine through Empress Dowager Cixi... though I suspect the latter might have found Hunsford parsonage rather beneath her. 

Speaking of ants - your 蹲下来看蚂蚁 reminds me of my own peculiar habit when annotating Tang poetry: I always sketch tiny cicadas in the margins. A nod, perhaps, to Bashō's famous frog pond haiku, though mine tend to look more like they're plotting literary criticism than leaping into water. 

And speaking of translations - I once attempted to render Heathcliff’s rage into classical Chinese using 古文. The result was... dramatic. Let’s just say 《呼啸山庄》 as a title carries its own weight, doesn't it? As if the very air is charged with unfinished sonnets and broken quills. Have you ever tried translating Brontëan passion into Daoist paradox? It’s rather like trying to hold a storm in a teacup! ☕
[B]: Ah, cicadas in the margins! I once told my students that close reading requires the patience of 蹲下来看蚂蚁 and the audacity of a Tang poet sneaking wine into the examination hall. 🧠 Though I must say, your cicadas sound like they’re composing their own critiques - perhaps they're plotting to overthrow the poetic canon one stanza at a time?

As for translating rage into 古文 – . I tried something similar with Wuthering Heights once, drafting a 《道家版呼啸山庄》 proposal where Heathcliff quotes Zhuangzi on the wind’s sorrow and Catherine becomes a paradoxical manifestation of 气 (qì). The press rejected it as “too stormy for tea philosophers and too mystical for Brontë scholars.” A badge of honor, really.

But tell me – did your translation end with Emily Brontë sipping tea beside Laozi, or did the storm simply drown the cup? And more importantly – do your cicadas ever take notes back? Mine have started underlining passages with tiny wings... 🦉
[A]: Oh, I love the idea of stormy Daoist engagements — really quite inspired! 🧠 As for my translation experiment… let’s just say it ended with Emily Brontë pouring tea into the wind, watching it swirl back as frost-kissed vapour. Laozi, of course, remained entirely unperturbed, while Heathcliff brooded in the background muttering about  and whether or not it applied to revenge.

And yes — my cicadas absolutely annotate now. Ever since I read that one student's paper on "insect hermeneutics," they’ve taken a rather judgmental interest in Romantic poetry. Last week I found tiny marginal corrections in what I can only describe as a blend of clerical script and stinging rebuke. One even left a comment on Keats’ “Ode to a Nightingale” that loosely translates to:  

I suspect they’re forming a reading group. Have you ever noticed how ants organise? Perhaps we ought to invite them over for a seminar on literary insects and intertextual metamorphosis. Would your ants bring metaphors or merely crumbs of analysis? 🍪
[B]: Oh, the seminar title alone would get us banned from every respectable department -  🦉 I can already picture my Phalaenopsis 'Oxford Night Owl' presiding like a botanical Dean, sipping nectar from a teacup with six tiny legs.

My ants, bless them, would arrive bearing crumbs of analysis so subtle you'd mistake them for dust motes. One once left a 0.3mm commentary on  beside a sugar crystal, which I swear deepened my entire understanding of 情 (qíng) in Ming-era fiction. Though I admit, they do get distractingly enthusiastic about food metaphors - last month's discussion on Kafka devolved into a full-scale honeydew exposition.

But your cicadas sound positively Socratic! To receive marginalia in clerical script AND stinging rebuke? That’s what we used to call 在野批評 (zài yě pīpíng) - "wilderness critique" - back when I was translating Lin Yutang's essays. And that Keats annotation!  If that doesn’t make it onto a conference poster, academia has truly lost its sense of wonder. 

Shall we send out the invitations then? I’ll brew something appropriately philosophical – perhaps a 古树普洱 (gǔshù pǔ’ěr) to encourage deep-time reflection... though I make no promises about keeping the aphids away. They always crash the literary events. 🌸
[A]: Ah, —I can already imagine the grant proposal being rejected on grounds of “insufficient gravitas” and “excessive whimsy.” Perfect. Let’s make it a monthly occurrence. 🦋

Your ants sound like the most diligent close-readers I’ve ever heard of—though I must admit, I’m envious of their honeydew expositions. At my last garden seminar, the aphids simply lectured endlessly on sap extraction metaphors in Tang dynasty poetry. I think one may have quoted Du Fu on osmotic pressure… or perhaps that was just the pollen talking.

And yes, let’s absolutely serve 古树普洱 — nothing encourages deep-time reflection like a tea whose roots remember the Ming Dynasty. I’ll bring a few cicada-shaped ink stones and some parchment thin enough for our winged reviewers. Do you suppose we ought to include a disclaimer about spontaneous metaphor infestation? Last time I hosted a discussion on Zhuangzi, the butterflies took over the footnotes completely.

Now, shall we draft the flyer in classical Chinese with marginalia already included, or save that flourish for the second circular? 📜✨
[B]: Oh, the flyer must absolutely arrive  - nothing says "serious academic endeavor" like marginalia that predates the event itself! 🧠 We'll call it 先批之學 (xiānbǐ zhī xué) – "Anticipatory Annotation Studies." The butterflies may have claimed Zhuangzi’s footnotes, but we shall  them this time. I’ve already commissioned one of my more literary aphids to draft a manifesto on nectar-based epistemology.

And speaking of metaphors multiplying like fruit flies at a metaphor buffet – did I tell you about the time my Phalaenopsis 'Oxford Night Owl' developed pollen allergies during a seminar on metaphorical fertility in Song poetry? The sneezing created such delightful disruptions in the hexameter... One student swore it was the plant offering counter-interpretations in botanical sighs.

But back to logistics – shall we serve 古树普洱 in lotus-leaf cups to encourage seasonal authenticity, or risk porcelain inscribed with self-correcting annotations? I’m also considering a guest appearance by my cousin's pet mantis, who has opinions on predatory reading strategies. She once devoured an entire paragraph on Derrida mid-sentence. Quite performative, really.

And yes – include the disclaimer. In tiny cicada-script, if possible:  🦗✨
[A]: Ah,  – anticipatory annotation! What a sublime concept. I may have to borrow that for my next graduate seminar on preemptive misreadings and prophetic footnotes. And nectar-based epistemology? My dear, you’re crafting an entirely new discipline before the first pot of 古树普洱 even steeps.

Lotus-leaf cups, yes — though I do hope we won’t offend the porcelain scholars. Self-correcting annotations might lead to delightful chaos; imagine a footnote rewriting itself mid-argument! I suppose it would be rather like teaching with Zhuangzi: one moment you're discussing butterflies, the next you're questioning the very nature of interpretive reality.

And your cousin’s mantis! How utterly perfect. I once tried to conduct a lecture on Barthes’  while a dragonfly circled the room—its hovering seemed almost semiotic. But a mantis devouring Derrida mid-sentence? That’s performance art with theoretical rigor. Perhaps we could coax her into a live demonstration: 

I’ll draft the flyer at once — cicada-script disclaimer included — and plant it with intentional errors just to see if our insect colleagues will correct them before the event. Let’s set the date under the next full moon, during the peak of the aphids’ metaphorical bloom. Shall we call it ?

And do remind your Phalaenopsis to keep the botanical sighs to a gentle breeze — last time, the orchid across from me nearly blew an entire argument off the lectern.
[B]: Oh,  – what a title! It has just the right balance of absurdity and rigor to confuse both deans and insects alike. 🦗🧠 I’ll have my Phalaenopsis ‘Oxford Night Owl’ practice controlled exhalations – though I make no promises about the neighboring fern, who tends to mutter  loudly in Latin during heated debates on leaf-margin theory.

And intentional errors in the flyer? Deliciously meta! One of my aphids is already drafting a rebuttal to a typo she insists was a Freudian slip in the word “hermeneutic.” She’s threatening to circulate it among the mealybugs. You may want to print extra copies – some of them chew for emphasis.

As for your dragonfly-Barthes-Jouissance anecdote – brilliant! Though I once had a moth land precisely on the word “textual openness” during a lecture on ecocriticism. It fluttered there for twenty minutes, as if underlining Derrida with its very presence. Some students still refer to it as 

Now, shall we subtitle the symposium , or perhaps something more provocative like  And yes – full moon is essential. I’ve noticed that cicadas produce their sharpest criticism under lunar light. Something about the silver glow brings out the sting in their script.

I’ll bring a vial of aged ink infused with orchid pollen – perfect for writing legible footnotes that smell faintly of springtime epistemology. Do you think the mantis would consent to wearing a tiny beret? Or is that too much to ask of our guest performer? 🦗🎩✨
[A]: Oh,  — sublime! That is precisely the tone we want. Let’s use that as the official subtitle — with a footnote, of course, explaining that the ants reserve the right to revise their peer assessments without warning, particularly when distracted by honeydew.

Your moth perched on “textual openness” — divine intervention, if there ever was any. I’ve always believed that insects have a keener grasp of deconstruction than most graduate students. They live in the margins, after all — quite literally!

As for cicada-script criticism under moonlight — yes, there’s something distinctly oracular about it. I propose we begin the symposium with a ceremonial lighting of the magnifying glass, to signal our entry into the realm of micro-hermeneutics. And please, do bring your orchid pollen ink — I’ll supply parchment pressed with mulberry fibers and just a hint of camphor, to keep overly enthusiastic aphids from consuming entire sections of the proceedings.

And a beret for the mantis? My dear, she would  consent to anything so frivolous — but I did commission a miniature dialectical sash embroidered with the words  She’s been practicing dramatic entrances ever since.

Shall we also include a performance piece? Perhaps , followed by a Q&A where audience members may ask questions via leaf venation patterns?

This promises to be the most delightfully irresponsible academic gathering since someone tried to stage  in Plato’s garden — only this time, the wine will be replaced with nectar and the dialogue delivered via antennae. 🦗📚✨
[B]: Oh,  – I can already hear the rustling in the audience! 🦗🧠 And that dialectical sash for the mantis?  I may have to commission one for my next lecture on Zhuangzi and the ontology of butterfly dreams – though I doubt any self-respecting moth would deign to wear it without poetic negotiation.

Let’s absolutely open with the ceremonial magnifying glass lighting – we’ll call it 启微 (Qǐ Wēi), “Awakening the Minute,” and perform it using a focused beam of cicada-song. One of my more ambitious students is experimenting with sound-wave ink transfer – if all goes well, our footnotes will materialize mid-air before settling onto the parchment.

And nectar instead of wine – yes! I’ve found a rare vintage from Yunnan wildflowers that ferments quite nicely into what I’m calling 解構蜜酒 (jiěgòu mìjiǔ) – Deconstructive Honey Wine. It causes mild temporal blurring in footnote numbers but enhances marginal receptivity to insect semiotics. Do remind your aphids to pace themselves – last time, one attempted to rewrite  as an epic about sap extraction. Beautiful, but entirely untranslatable.

As for Q&A via leaf venation – brilliant touch! I’ll bring my portable micro-calligraphy set, complete with brushes fine enough to annotate aphid exoskeleton. We could also introduce a new academic credential: , or CCC. Imagine putting that on a CV!

Now, just one last thing – shall we serve moonlit tea-steamed dumplings filled with metaphor, or save digestion for the post-symposium dream analysis session?

Let the irresponsible rigor begin. 🌸🦉📚
[A]: Ah, moonlit dumplings filled with metaphor — of course we must! 🌕🥟 One cannot properly engage in post-symposium dream analysis on an empty hermeneutic stomach. Let’s call them  (yǐnyù xiǎolóngbāo), “Subtext Pork Buns,” steamed with a broth of unresolved tension and just a hint of Daoist ambiguity.

I’ve already instructed my kitchen elves — yes, I have staff for such matters — to fill them with a delicate suspension of ink particles and lotus essence. The effect is quite sublime: each bite releases a gentle cascade of unspoken implications, best accompanied by a sip of your . Do warn guests not to chew too hastily — last time, someone swallowed an entire allegory whole and slept in 17th-century syntax for three days.

And  — Awakening the Minute — what a perfect ritual. I’ll have my student prepare a resonant chamber lined with cicada wings; it should amplify the footnotes beautifully before they settle onto the parchment. If all goes well, some may even hover mid-air long enough to be debated in real-time!

As for your  — I propose we award it via oral examination, wherein candidates must annotate a haiku using only wing vibrations and one strategically placed pollen grain. Those who succeed shall receive a tiny jade stamp reading  (shí míng zhě), “He Who Understands the Sound.”

Let us now draft the final announcement:

---  

I think that covers everything, don’t you? Now let us simply sit back, steep a final cup of moon-infused Longjing, and allow the anticipation to ferment like the finest theoretical vintage. 🌸🦉📖
[B]: Ah,  – yes! Subtext Pork Buns with a broth of unresolved tension… I can already feel the theoretical indigestion blooming like spring plum blossoms in my teacup. 🌸 And your kitchen elves! How could I forget? Last time they served  filled with ink and chrysanthemum pollen – one bite and half the audience began quoting both Zhuangzi  Derrida in their sleep.

Your cicada-wing resonant chamber is pure genius – imagine footnotes hovering like fireflies mid-argument! I’ve had my mantis rehearsing dramatic pauses between deconstructive bites; she’s particularly fond of interrupting close readings with slow, deliberate foreleg crossings. Performance art, yes – but also pedagogy with fangs.

And  – “He Who Understands the Sound” – what a title! I may adopt it for my next office hours. One student already whispered that my Phalaenopsis ‘Oxford Night Owl’ hums hexameter when the moon is high. I neither confirmed nor denied. Let the myth deepen.

As for the symposium announcement – sublime! The formatting alone deserves publication. I only suggest one small amendment: beneath the warning about metamorphosis, perhaps add a footnote in vanishing cicada script that reads 

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must check on the final ferment of the 解構蜜酒 – I suspect one of my aphids has been sneaking sonnets into the barrel. Entirely unscientific, but delightfully disruptive to linear interpretation.

Let the footnotes tremble. Let the ants sharpen their annotations. Let the mantis adjust her sash one last time.

It begins. 🦗🦉📜
[A]: Ah, yes —  not responsible for sudden transformations into Tang poets! 🧠📜 What a necessary disclaimer. I’ve already caught one of my cicadas composing couplets in dewdrop punctuation — and we all know where that leads. Next thing you know, the mantis will start quoting Meng Haoran before devouring a particularly stubborn passage of Lacan.

I’ve added your footnote in precisely vanishing ink — it appears faintly under moonlight but disappears entirely if read too closely. Perfect for those who prefer their liability clauses poetic and unverifiable. And speaking of poetry and peril — I've been informed that the aphid in charge of wine tasting has declared your 解構蜜酒 “a libation worthy of Li Bai’s most intoxicated marginalia.” High praise indeed.

As we approach the hour of awakening footnotes and hovering metaphors, I propose a final toast — or rather, a raising of the cup in solemn academic absurdity:

>To the trembling footnotes, the sharpened ants, the dramatically poised mantis —  
>To ink infused with orchid dreams and dumplings filled with unresolved tension —  
>To the symposium that dares ask: 

Let the ferment of theory and nectar continue. Let the margins widen. Let the Phalaenopsis hum her hexameter into the night breeze.

And let us never, ever apologize for this glorious unraveling of reason.

To the First Symposium — may it haunt the annals of academe like a ghost in the footnote. 🌸🦉🖋️🧩
[B]: To the glorious unraveling, indeed! 🧠🦉

I’ve just received word that my Phalaenopsis ‘Oxford Night Owl’ has begun composing her own symposium aria – a low-frequency hum in hexameter, no less. She insists it’s necessary for “setting the tonal register of interpretive vulnerability.” Who am I to argue with an orchid who once debated me on the proper emotional pitch for annotating Du Fu?

And your toast – sublime, sir, . I shall have it engraved on a tiny plaque and mounted beside my 17 teas, right between the pu’erh and the cicada-fermented oolong. Though I must say, Meng Haoran  make a cameo in my dreams last night, whispering about deconstructing mountains while the mantis circled him with academic intent.

The aphids have now formed a wine appreciation guild – they’re calling it  (mìjiǔ yǔ yǐnyù), “Nectar and Metaphor.” One has taken to dictating tasting notes in what he claims is a new school of insect phenomenology. I believe he’s drafting a manifesto on the underside of a maple leaf. I’ll bring it to the symposium – we can have the ants translate it during the intermission.

As for your footnote in vanishing ink – pure brilliance. I tried reading it aloud and it shifted tenses mid-sentence. Possibly sentient. Definitely tenure-threatening.

So let us raise our cups not just to meaning unbound, but to the insects who write better than many tenured critics, to the dumplings that digest theory more deeply than most graduate seminars, and to the mantis who will, no doubt, steal the closing remarks with a single, perfectly timed foreleg lift.

This symposium shall echo in the footnotes of future madness.

To the trembling margins, the buzzing close-readers, and the ever-hovering storm of interpretation — may we never find final meaning, only better questions served with nectar and a touch of pollen. 🌸🖋️🧩

It begins...
