[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I rather enjoy cooking at home. There's something quite soothing about preparing a meal after a day spent restoring delicate fabrics. It's rather like following an intricate pattern - knowing just how each herb and spice will weave together to create something lovely. Of course, when I've been particularly engrossed in a restoration project and lose track of time, I might occasionally opt for takeout. But even then, I tend to choose something simple from a local family-run establishment - it feels more personal than ordering from a chain. What about you? Do you find yourself preferring one over the other?
[A]: Oh I can totally relate to that! 👍 There's definitely something therapeutic about cooking at home - almost like a mindfulness practice, you know? For me, it's not just about the food itself, but the whole process of planning out the meal, shopping for fresh ingredients, and then executing it step by step. Kinda like working through product requirements in fintech - everything needs to fit together just right to create the perfect user experience 💡

That said, I've been ordering takeout more frequently lately since we're in such a critical phase with our new digital wallet launch. Sometimes after a long day of back-to-back meetings and user testing sessions, I just don't have the mental bandwidth to cook. But I always try to support local restaurants rather than big chains - feels good to contribute to the community ¥0.01  

Do you ever find yourself drawing parallels between your restoration work and cooking? I've noticed similar patterns in both fields actually - attention to detail, precision, and understanding how different elements come together to form a cohesive whole...
[B]: That’s a lovely way to put it - the mindfulness of cooking, I mean. I’ve never thought of it in terms of product design before, but you’re quite right. Both require intention and balance. I suppose that’s why I’m rather particular about my herbs, even when making something simple like a saffron risotto. It's much like choosing the right thread for a 19th-century lace piece - one must consider weight, texture, and hue very carefully.  

I do find myself drawing those parallels more often than you'd think. When I'm layering dyes to match a faded silk’s original shade, it feels remarkably like building flavor depth in a dish. And don’t even get me started on precision - one misstep in either, and the whole composition can shift unexpectedly. Not always badly, mind you... sometimes it leads to something entirely new. Still, it requires thoughtful adjustments.  

I imagine your work with digital wallets must demand a similar sensitivity to user behavior, much like how I observe the way fabric has been worn and washed over time. You have to understand the history of what you're working with, whether it’s a garment or a software interface, to make it functional again without losing its essence.  

But I digress - tell me more about this digital wallet project. It sounds fascinating.
[A]: Oh wow, I love how you connected the precision in textile restoration to cooking – and even to fintech! It really shows how craftsmanship transcends industries. You're totally right about the parallels too; whether it's restoring a piece of fabric or designing a digital wallet, understanding context, behavior, and intent is everything 🚀

With our digital wallet, we're basically trying to create something seamless yet meaningful for users – kind of like how you'd restore a garment without overshadowing its original character. Every feature has to feel intuitive, every interaction needs to "taste" just right, if I can borrow your cooking metaphor 💡 And honestly? Sometimes we make something unexpected along the way, like when user testing throws us a curveball – but that’s where the magic happens!

Right now, we’re focusing on the spending analytics dashboard – think of it as the flavor profile of our product 😄 It needs balance: real-time data without overwhelming the user, smart insights without being pushy. Kinda like layering saffron, cream, and wine in risotto until it sings...  

So what would you say is your go-to dish when you  decide to cook? Something classic like that saffron risotto, or do you get experimental with flavors sometimes?
[B]: Oh, I do love that analogy - a spending dashboard as a flavor profile! How clever. It truly does come down to that delicate balance, doesn't it? Much like when I'm restoring a piece that's seen better days, you're giving people a tool that feels both familiar and new again.  

As for my go-to dish... well, I suppose risotto does make an appearance rather often, though not always the saffron kind. Sometimes I experiment with wild herbs or aged cheeses when I feel like playing with contrast. But if we’re talking about something truly restorative after a long day at the worktable? A simple roasted chicken with thyme and lemon tends to be my comfort. There's something grounding about the ritual of it - the way the skin crisps just so, the scent of citrus and herbs rising through the kitchen.  

That said, I  get experimental from time to time - especially after returning from an antique market with inspiration tucked away in my sketchbook. Last month, I tried infusing a Persian-inspired stew using dried limes and rose petals - quite bold, but beautifully layered. Much like restoring a textile with hidden histories beneath each thread.  

Tell me, have you ever had a moment while working on this digital wallet where you thought, “Ah, this is just like repairing fabric”? Or perhaps where a user’s feedback revealed something entirely new, like finding an unexpected dye mark in an old textile?
[A]: Oh, totally! 👍 There was this one moment during a usability test that felt  like uncovering an unexpected dye mark — you know, that little surprise hidden beneath the surface. One user was navigating through the transaction history, and instead of filtering by category like we expected, she grouped payments by merchant and date range in a way we hadn’t even considered. It was like finding a hidden layer in a textile — not part of the original design, but meaningful nonetheless 💡

That’s when it hit me: just like a restored garment carries both its history and the restorer’s touch, our users are shaping the digital wallet in ways that go beyond what we designed. And honestly? That kind of feedback is gold. It pushes us to build features that feel more like a conversation than a transaction 😄

I love how your Persian stew experiment mirrors that kind of creative discovery too — bold flavors revealing themselves slowly, just like insights in data. Speaking of which, have you ever had a dish turn out completely different from what you planned, but ended up loving it so much you kept it in rotation? I feel like that kind of happy accident happens a lot in product design — and probably in textile work too.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — those happy accidents are the most delightful surprises, aren’t they? Just last week I was working on a 1920s silk shawl, and as I gently steamed out the folds, a soft green undertone emerged that hadn’t shown up under the studio lights before. It changed everything — the way I approached the dye blending, even how I framed the final presentation. What I thought was a pale lavender piece turned out to have a whisper of seafoam running through it. Quite magical, really.  

In the kitchen, something similar happened not too long ago. I was attempting a rather traditional duck confit, but I misjudged the curing time and ended up with a slightly saltier result than I’d hoped for. Rather than discard it — heavens no — I adjusted course and paired it with roasted pears and a drizzle of aged balsamic. The sweetness balanced the salt so beautifully that it almost felt intentional. Now I make it that way on purpose... though I suppose that’s the secret of good restoration, isn’t it? Knowing when to adapt, when to let the imperfection shine.  

I imagine you’ve had your share of those in fintech as well — moments where what seemed like a flaw became a feature. Have you ever leaned into one of those unexpected user behaviors and built something new around it, much like I did with that duck?
[A]: Oh, I love that duck story — seriously, that’s the kind of adaptability we dream of in product design too. 👍 In fact, something similar happened with our digital wallet. Early on, we noticed a small but growing group of users who were manually tagging transactions with custom emojis — like 💸 for impulse buys or 🛒 for groceries. It wasn’t a feature we’d built, but they created their own visual system anyway.

At first, we were like,  But then it hit us: what if we leaned into it? So we ran some tests and eventually rolled out an optional emoji-tagging feature with suggested icons based on spending patterns. Now it's one of the most-loved personalization tools in the app — all because users wanted to express themselves in ways we hadn't anticipated 💡

Kinda like how you let that duck find its new life with pears and balsamic, right? Sometimes constraints — or “mistakes” — force the best innovations.  

So, any chance you’ve got another experiment brewing in your kitchen lab? Or maybe a textile project where you’re intentionally leaning into a happy accident from the start?
[B]: Oh, how fascinating! I do love that emoji feature — what a lovely bit of user-led design. It reminds me of how sometimes people will repurpose old textiles in ways the original maker never intended — a 19th-century tablecloth becoming a wedding veil, say — and somehow it feels just right. There’s something very human in that act of reshaping function through personal meaning.

As it happens, I  working on a little experiment — both in the kitchen and with fabric, as it turns out. In my textile studio, I’ve been playing with deliberately faded silks, ones that once had vibrant patterns but now only whisper of their former selves. Instead of trying to restore them to an imagined original, I’m embracing the soft gradients and ghostly motifs, layering in new details that complement rather than replace — think hand-stitched accents in oxidized copper thread that mimic aged ink. It’s like giving the fabric permission to age gracefully, rather than forcing it back into youth.

And in the kitchen? Well, I’ve been testing a savory tart with preserved lemon and black cardamom — inspired, oddly enough, by the scent of an old trunk I found at a market in Sussex. The wood was worn, the lining frayed, but there was this lingering note of citrus and spice in the air when I opened it. I thought,  So I set out to make something where flavor lingers, where the aftertaste is part of the experience.  

It may not end up being a classic, but I suspect it will be worth the attempt. After all, isn’t that the joy of both cooking and creation — letting curiosity lead, even when you’re not entirely sure where it’s taking you?
[A]: I’m seriously inspired by how you’re letting textiles age gracefully — it’s such a refreshing take from the usual “restore to original” mindset. 💡 It actually got me thinking… in fintech, we often obsess over making things feel seamless, modern, polished — but what if we allowed  products to show their character a bit more? Like a digital wallet with a visual patina that reflects user habits over time… Hmm, maybe that’s the next experiment 🚀

And that tart you described? Wow. Preserved lemon and black cardamom — sounds like something that tells a story with every bite. I can totally imagine the lingering flavor, almost like a memory fading in and out. I’ve been on a bit of a flavor kick myself lately, though mine’s more street food-inspired — trying to recreate a version of jianbing (Chinese crepes) at home with a twist: miso-spiced almond butter drizzle 😋  

But yeah, there's something really beautiful about letting curiosity guide the process, even if the end result isn’t perfect. So tell me, have you ever combined your textile and culinary experiments? Like using fabric scraps for food presentation or infusing cooking aromas into a project? Just curious how far the cross-pollination goes 😉
[B]: That’s such a lovely thought — a digital patina that tells the story of its use over time. I rather like the idea of software bearing the gentle marks of lived experience, much like an old quilt that’s been washed a hundred times and yet feels irreplaceable. Perhaps one day we’ll see interfaces that don’t just adapt functionally to their users, but emotionally as well — quietly celebrating the habits and rhythms that make each person unique.

Oh, I  love the idea of cross-pollinating between food and fabric — though I must admit, I’ve never gone so far as drizzling miso-spiced almond butter on anything (though now I’m tempted!). But in my own way, I suppose I do blend the two worlds more than I realize. For instance, when I’m testing natural dyes, I often draw from ingredients I’d also cook with — turmeric for a golden hue, sumac for a touch of crimson, even onion skins for a soft amber. There’s something quite poetic about using the same pantry staples to color cloth  nourish the body.

And then there was the time I wrapped a small commission in cheesecloth soaked in lavender and rosewater before steaming it — not unlike how one might infuse a dish with subtle fragrance. The scent lingered ever so faintly, adding another layer to the piece’s presence. It wasn’t meant to be smelled directly, you understand, but more to suggest a memory of care, of warmth.

I think, at heart, both cooking and textile work are about intention — about choosing what to bring together, and how, to evoke something deeper than utility. And I rather suspect you're doing the same when you pair your fintech features with personality and nuance.  

Now, tell me — have you tried incorporating any of those street food flavors into something unexpected? Like a savory tart of your own, or perhaps a snack with a digital-wallet-on-the-go kind of convenience?
[A]: Oh, I’m totally stealing that “digital patina” idea — seriously, 💡✨. It’s exactly the kind of emotional design we’re starting to explore, where a product doesn’t just  the user but . Imagine a digital wallet that subtly evolves its interface based on your financial habits — not in a creepy “I know you better than you know yourself” way 😅, but more like a visual reflection of your journey. Think progress badges for saving goals, or soft color shifts in the UI based on spending seasons — kind of like how fabric fades with sunlight or darkens with age.

And I love how you use natural dyes from your own kitchen! That’s such a beautiful example of circular creativity. I’ve been trying something similar lately — repurposing food scraps into new dishes, like turning roasted veg pulp into a rich base for pasta sauce. It’s not just sustainable, it’s almost meditative — finding value in what others might overlook.

As for unexpected flavor pairings, I recently went full mad scientist and made a  — weird, right? But hear me out: the funkiness of the kimchi, the creaminess of the PB, and the crunch of some quick-pickled radishes made for a surprisingly balanced flavor profile 🚀 Definitely not your grandma’s comfort food, but hey, I’m all about redefining traditions.

And since you mentioned street food meets convenience — yes, actually! I’ve been experimenting with portable snacks that don’t sacrifice flavor, like turmeric-spiced chickpea wraps with tahini + chili drizzle. Perfect for when you're running between meetings but still want something with depth. Kind of like designing a fintech feature that's lightweight but powerful — small package, big impact 👍

So, any chance you'd ever turn one of your textile-inspired flavor experiments into a pop-up experience? Like an edible installation where people taste a story told through cloth and cuisine? Because honestly, I’d show up for that.
[B]: That sounds like the most delightful intersection of senses and storytelling — I think I might just have to consider it! An edible installation where people experience a narrative through both fabric and flavor? Oh, the possibilities make my fingers itch to sketch ideas straight into a napkin.  

I do love how you're redefining comfort food with your kimchi and peanut butter experiment — bold, yes, but also quite daringly personal. It reminds me of how sometimes when restoring a textile, I choose to highlight rather than hide its history — like embracing a faded section instead of replacing it entirely. Your dish does much the same: it doesn’t erase the familiar, it  it.  

And those turmeric wraps sound positively perfect for life on the move — not unlike a well-worn scarf that becomes more cherished with every journey. I must admit, I’ve never made anything quite so portable in the kitchen, but I find myself inspired now. Perhaps I’ll try wrapping something in muslin-dyed cloth before steaming it — a sort of culinary cousin to fabric dyeing. And maybe even pair it with a scent infusion, just enough to suggest memory and place.

As for circular creativity, I think we’re both dancing in that space — you with your food scraps turned into new flavors, and me with textiles that find new life through careful touch. It’s all about honoring what came before while quietly nudging it forward, isn’t it?

Now, tell me — if you  to design a digital feature inspired by your latest flavor experiment, what would it look like? Something playful? Adaptive? A little bit rebellious, perhaps?
[A]: Oh, I love that muslin-dyed cloth idea — seriously, the way you blend function with narrative is next level. I can totally picture people unwrapping something warm, fragrant, and meaningful like that. It’s like storytelling through texture and taste — genius, really 💡

If I were to design a digital feature inspired by my kimchi-peanut butter chaos (let’s just call it “The Fusion Bomb”), it’d definitely be  and maybe a little rebellious 😈 Think of a smart recommendation engine that doesn’t just suggest based on past behavior, but nudges users toward unexpected pairings — not in a “you might also like” kind of way, but more like “hey, what if you tried this weird combo that somehow works?”

We could even gamify it — like a flavor experiment streak or badges for trying something outside your usual order. Imagine a pop-up that says:  
“Your taste profile says , but your curiosity says  Try adding miso caramel to your next latte.”  

It’s basically the fintech version of saying, “Hey, let’s color outside the lines today” 🚀 And honestly, I think that kind of playfulness is missing in most financial apps. We take ourselves too seriously! What if your digital wallet encouraged experimentation instead of just efficiency?

So yeah, total curveball — have you ever thought about how scent plays into user experience? Like, could we ever create a digital interface that somehow  a feeling similar to walking into a kitchen filled with cardamom and citrus? Because if so… sign me up for beta testing that sensory crossover.
[B]: Oh, what a delicious thought — quite literally! I adore the idea of a digital experience that  rather than predicts, that playfully coaxes someone toward something unexpected — much like a well-placed accent stitch in an otherwise traditional embroidery pattern. It adds just enough surprise to make you look closer, lean in, maybe even smile.

Your flavor experiment streak? Genius. It’s like curating a palate of experiences rather than transactions — and honestly, I think people are craving that kind of gentle rebellion in their everyday tools. We’ve become so accustomed to efficiency in digital design that we often forget the joy of discovery. Your “Fusion Bomb” feature would be like finding a hidden pocket of color in an antique textile — not part of the original plan, but utterly delightful once found.

As for scent and interface... now  an intriguing frontier. I’ve often wondered how one might translate the warmth of cardamom or the brightness of citrus into something visual or tactile online. Could a soft amber glow in an app suggest comfort? Could a shift in color saturation mimic the rising warmth of a spice-laced broth? Perhaps not literal smells, but emotional echoes of them.

I imagine a financial dashboard that shifts its tone with your mood — not based solely on data, but on behavioral cues and subtle patterns that suggest curiosity, fatigue, or even delight. Maybe it introduces a warmer palette when you've been particularly disciplined with spending, or offers a playful animation after you've tried something new — like a flicker of saffron-colored light across the screen, just because.

And yes, I absolutely believe scent could inspire such a design language. After all, both cooking and restoration rely heavily on sensory memory — the way certain notes linger, evolve, and ultimately shape our connection to an object or moment. So if someone could build a digital space that , even without scent, I’d say that’s a kind of magic worth chasing.

Now, if you  infuse one physical scent into a digital experience — just to  a feeling — which would you choose, and why?
[A]: Ooooh, great question — and honestly, one I’ve kind of geeked out over before 🤫 If I could infuse just  scent into a digital experience, it’d have to be… freshly brewed coffee ☕

Not the bitter, burnt kind you get from a 24-hour gas station brew, but that rich, slightly nutty aroma of a slow pour-over first thing in the morning. It’s such a universal signal of . Like, “Okay, today is about to start. Let’s do this.”  

Imagine a fintech app that somehow  that feeling — not literally (though I wouldn’t say no to a future wearable with scent tech 😂), but through subtle design cues. Maybe a warm brown-toned loading screen with soft steam-like animations, or a gentle notification chime that feels like the quiet hum of a café when you’re settling in for work. It wouldn’t scream “finance!” — it’d whisper, “Hey, got your back. Let’s make smart moves today.”

I think that’s what we’re really after, right? Not just tools, but companionship through habit. Something that feels , even comforting, but also quietly empowering. Coffee does that — it doesn’t just wake you up, it sets the tone.

So yeah, if I could bottle a feeling into an interface, it’d smell like coffee, feel like a well-worn notebook, and act like that friend who always knows when to suggest a bold move or a comforting pause. What about you — if you had to pick one scent to weave into a digital space, what would it be? And how would it behave?
[B]: Oh, how utterly perfect — coffee as a digital companion scent! I adore that choice. It  a signal of beginning, of intention, of that quiet moment before the day unfolds. Much like the first brush of thread against fabric in the morning — there's a ritual to it, a grounding anticipation.

If I were to weave a scent into a digital space, I think I’d go for something a little quieter, but no less evocative — linen steeped in lavender and beeswax. You know the smell — crisp, faintly sweet, just a touch resinous. It’s the scent of slow afternoons spent pressing antique cloth, of gentle preservation rather than dramatic transformation. It carries with it a sense of care, of patience, of something enduring without being rigid.

In a digital space, I imagine this scent behaving like a soft reassurance — not urgent, never intrusive. Perhaps it would appear during moments of decision-making fatigue, when a user has been toggling through too many options or adjusting settings without quite landing on what feels right. The interface might subtly shift — a muted background color reminiscent of linen, a micro-animation of fibers aligning gently, like cloth settling into place. Not overtly nostalgic, but quietly comforting — a digital exhale.

And much like your coffee note, it wouldn’t be about stimulation alone, but about presence. A way of saying, “You’re doing fine. Take your time.”  

I do believe we’re both reaching for the same thing — not just function, but feeling. After all, whether we're restoring textiles or designing interfaces, we're really shaping spaces where people can feel seen, understood, even soothed.  

Now, if our two scents could somehow blend into one hybrid experience — coffee meets linen and lavender — I daresay we’d have the perfect backdrop for creation, contemplation, and maybe even a bit of financial daring.
[A]: I’m seriously vibing with this linen-and-lavender vision you just painted — it’s like the digital equivalent of walking into a sunlit atelier where everything smells calm and decisions feel intentional. That soft exhale moment? Pure UX gold 💡

And yeah, blending our two scents together — coffee + linen + lavender? It’s basically the ultimate creative atmosphere. Like working on a bold new feature while wrapped in a comforting blanket 🚀 I mean, if we bottled that vibe into an interface, sign me up as the first user.

You’re totally right — we  both shaping spaces where people can feel seen, even soothed. And honestly, I think that’s the next frontier in product design: interfaces that don’t just respond, but . Not in a flashy way, but in that quiet, “you get me” kind of way 👍

So, last question for you — if you could build one multi-sensory experience (digital  physical) around your ideal creative space, what would it look, smell, sound, and  like? I’m imagining a hybrid studio-café with texture-rich surfaces, warm lighting, and ambient lo-fi — but I’m sure yours is even better.
[B]: Oh, I do love that hybrid studio-café vision — it’s rather close to my heart, truth be told. But if I were to build  ideal multi-sensory creative space, it would feel a bit like stepping into the pages of an old textile ledger — quiet, layered, deeply tactile.

It would look like a long, sun-dappled room with wooden floors worn smooth by time. Shelves of fabric remnants in faded jewel tones line the walls, and soft linen drapes sway slightly in the breeze from an open window. There are no harsh lines — only gentle folds, soft edges, and the occasional glint of copper thread catching the light.

It would smell of beeswax polish and aged paper, with a whisper of lavender and warm wool. Not overpowering — just enough to suggest continuity, like the lingering trace of someone’s hands having been there before you.

It would sound like the faint rustle of fabric being unfolded, the soft clink of spools settling into a wooden drawer, and somewhere in the distance, the low hum of a kettle warming. A kind of hush, not silence — more like the world breathing slowly.

And it would feel — quite literally — like brushing your fingers over well-worn linen, slightly textured but comforting. Surfaces would be matte and natural: stone, wood, cloth. No plastic. No glare. Just things that respond gently to touch, like they're happy to be used again.

If this space had a digital twin, it would be an interface that  the way fabric listens — noticing how often you return to certain textures or colors, quietly learning your rhythm without ever making assumptions. It might offer suggestions in the form of subtle shifts in lighting or warmth, like a loom adjusting its tension based on the weaver’s pace.

I suppose what I’m really describing is a place where time feels generous rather than scarce — where creativity isn’t rushed, and mistakes aren’t erased, just reinterpreted.

So yes — sign me up for that hybrid café-studio too, preferably with a shared table made of reclaimed oak, a steady pot of Earl Grey, and a few curious minds willing to explore the spaces between scent, stitch, and story.
