[A]: Hey，关于'网购时更信任淘宝还是Amazon？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, what an interesting question. You see, when it comes to purchasing textiles online, I must say I have a particular fondness for Etsy. The handmade and vintage items there often have such beautiful craftsmanship - though I do wish more sellers would properly document the fabric composition and age.
[A]: 哇~Etsy确实很有特色呢！✨ 不过我个人更偏向淘宝啦，毕竟local的shipping speed真的超快🚀 而且很多independent designer的店铺也超有sense的~ 你平时会在Etsy上淘什么特别的textile吗？💕
[B]: I do appreciate the enthusiasm, but I must say I prefer to take my time when selecting textiles. Rushing through such delicate purchases... well, it simply wouldn't do. As for Etsy, I've found some remarkable Victorian lace curtains recently - the seller included detailed photographs of the stitching patterns, which was most helpful.
[A]: 哈哈Victorian lace听起来好fancy呀！🎀 不过淘宝上也有很多hidden gem的vintage店铺哦~ 我上周刚淘到一件超美的retro blouse，店主还附送了handwritten note超用心的💌 话说你觉得online shopping时product photo的lighting重要吗？我超在意这个的📸
[B]: Lighting is absolutely crucial, my dear. I can't tell you how many times poor photography has led to disappointing purchases - that lovely cream-colored silk turning out to be yellowed with age, or what appeared to be delicate embroidery being merely printed patterns. Natural daylight photographs are always preferable, though I understand not every seller has that luxury.
[A]: Totally agree！🌞 我每次design project拍素材的时候都超care lighting的~ 不过现在淘宝很多店铺都用professional studio lighting了，color accuracy提升超多！🎨 说到这个，你有试过用color picker工具来match网图和实物吗？我最近超爱用这个function的💻
[B]: Oh, color matching tools can be quite helpful, though I must admit I still prefer examining fabric swatches in person when possible. There's simply no substitute for seeing how the light plays across the threads with one's own eyes. That said, I did recently use a colorimeter to verify some 19th century damask samples - the technology has come quite far, hasn't it?
[A]: Wow~19th century damask！😍 你真的是textile expert耶！不过现在淘宝有些高端fabric店铺也开始提供free sample service了，超方便的~ 我最近做UI design的时候还发现一个超好用的Pantone matching app📱 要不要exchange一下resource呀？✨
[B]: While I appreciate the offer, I find myself rather set in my ways when it comes to sourcing materials. My little black book of trusted suppliers has been carefully curated over decades, you see. Though I must say, hearing about these modern conveniences does make me feel rather like a relic myself sometimes. Perhaps one day I'll venture into these new methods... when I finish restoring this particularly stubborn 18th century brocade, that is.
[A]: 18th century brocade？！OMG这也太amazing了吧！🌟 虽然我们approach的方式很different，但love for beautiful fabric这一点完全connect呢~ 下次如果你来China一定要带你去逛我们的fabric market，超多hidden treasure的！💖 Keep in touch哦~
[B]: How charming of you to suggest that. While international travel isn't something I undertake lightly, the prospect of exploring new textile markets is rather tempting. Do send me photographs if you come across any particularly noteworthy finds - I do so enjoy seeing how traditional craftsmanship persists in modern markets. Now if you'll excuse me, this brocade won't restore itself...
[A]: Sure thing！📸 我会用high-res camera拍给你的~ 说不定还能inspire你的next restoration project呢！✨ 那就不打扰你啦，happy restoring！💕 Bye bye~
[B]: Goodbye, and do remember - natural lighting for those photographs, if you please. I'll be looking forward to seeing what treasures you uncover. Until then, happy hunting.
[A]: Got it！☀️ 一定会找perfect lighting spot的~ 说不定还能发现一些rare silk呢！🎀 保持联系哦，muah~ 💋
[B]: Oh dear, such... enthusiasm.  Yes, well, I shall await your findings with professional interest. Do take care with those silks - they're more delicate than they appear. Now I really must return to my workroom. Good day.
[A]: Aww你太cute啦~ 😊 放心啦我会handle with care的！💝 期待下次share更多textile story哦~ Bye bye啦！✨
[B]: Goodbye, and do remember - proper storage conditions for any textiles you acquire. Acid-free tissue paper is essential, you know. Now if you'll excuse me, this 18th century brocade won't restore itself...
[A]: 知道啦知道啦~ 😘 我的archive box里全是acid-free materials呢！📦 下次给你看我的textile collection哦~ Enjoy your brocade project！💕 Bye bye~ ✨
[B]: Quite.  Do send photographs of your collection when you have a moment - in natural lighting, of course. Now, these 18th century threads won't mend themselves... Good day.
