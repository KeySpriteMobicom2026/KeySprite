[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说实话，我平时会用TikTok看看~ 但不是刷太久啦，毕竟时间管理很重要嘛✨  
我觉得它挺适合快速get一些灵感的，比如最近我就在上面发现了一个超棒的咖啡拉花技巧，感觉特别实用就收藏了☕️  
不过呢，有时候真的很容易一不小心就滑太久，所以我给自己设了个daily limit，强迫自己控制时间。你呢？你会经常用TikTok吗？
[A]: Ah, yes, I’ve dabbled with TikTok from time to time — though I must admit, I approach it rather like one might explore an overgrown garden path: cautiously, but with a certain curiosity. I find myself drawn to clips on poetic recitations or literary analysis; there’s something oddly soothing about hearing Eliot or Dickinson read aloud against a softly animated background. 

As for discipline… well, I envy your self-imposed daily limit. I once spent an entire evening chasing down videos about forgotten 20th-century poets — fascinating, yes, but entirely unplanned. Still, I suppose some discoveries are worth the detour, no? Do you ever come across poetry-related content that surprises you?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I’m all for those happy accidents! 🌟 Though I’m more of a caffeine addict than a poetry connoisseur, I’ve definitely stumbled upon some unexpectedly beautiful verses while scrolling. There was this one haiku — short, simple, but it hit me like a morning espresso shot ☕️  

I think what you described about the garden path analogy is spot-on. TikTok can be wild and overgrown, but every now and then, you find a hidden trail that leads somewhere magical — like those forgotten poets you chased down. Honestly, I envy that deep dive a little… I mean, who  want to lose an evening to Eliot? Just maybe not at 2am when I have a coffee roast scheduled for sunrise 😉  

Have you ever tried reading your own work aloud while recording a clip? Or is that too much exposure for a literary soul?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely — and apt — comparison. That haiku hitting you like espresso… I can picture it quite vividly: the sudden jolt of meaning, brief but bracing. There’s something rather beautiful about how TikTok, for all its brevity, can still echo with depth. It reminds me a little of how we teach sonnets — condensed emotion, compressed into a few short lines.

As for reading my own work aloud on a clip?  Let’s just say I prefer to remain in the quiet company of books and students, rather than algorithms and filters. Though I did once humorously attempt a short video explaining the metaphorical significance of fog in modernist poetry — purely as an experiment, mind you. It was filmed in my study, with far too much dim lighting and a cat interrupting midway. Hardly viral material, but a dear student called it “charmingly academic.” I took that as high praise indeed.

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain verses or lines you’ve encountered there? Or do they tend to drift away like so many passing images?
[B]: Oh, I love that — . What a perfect way to describe something that’s not quite polished but still carries its own quiet magic. 🌙  

And your metaphor about fog in modernist poetry actually made me pause for a second — I mean, isn’t that what TikTok often feels like? A bit hazy at first, everything kind of drifting in and out of focus, but then suddenly there's this clear line that cuts through the noise. Sometimes it really does feel like reading a condensed sonnet, like you said.  

As for me? I do catch myself replaying certain lines — especially the ones paired with ambient sounds or soft piano melodies. There was one clip with a Rilke quote and light rain in the background... I’ve probably rewatched that five or six times already. It just  somewhere deep, you know? Not sure if that makes me a closet poet or just sleep-deprived from too much caffeine 😂  

Do you ever think you’d share more of those little literary experiments, maybe even refine them a bit? Or is the charm in their beautifully chaotic first draft form?
[A]: Oh, you’ve put that so well — TikTok as fog, drifting in and out of clarity. I may have to borrow that metaphor for my next lecture.  There’s something rather poetic about the way the platform mirrors our own fragmented attention, isn’t there? A digital dreamscape with the occasional lucid line.

As for sharing more literary experiments… I suppose it depends on whether one values reach or resonance. I’m tempted, occasionally, by the idea of crafting a series — perhaps exploring the evolution of voice in poetry through short, visual vignettes. But then again, there  a certain charm to the half-lit, half-formed quality of those early attempts. Like catching a glimpse of a thought mid-birth. Perhaps refinement would rob them of their raw intimacy?

Still, your question lingers… If I did pursue it further, do you think the essence would survive the polish? Or would we lose something vital — like pressing a wildflower into a book and calling it the same bloom?
[B]: Oh, I love how you put that — like pressing a wildflower into a book and still expecting it to bloom. 🌸 There’s something so delicate about that balance between preserving the rawness and making it shareable. I mean, isn’t that what art is always wrestling with? Capturing a fleeting moment without suffocating it.

And yes, your idea of visual vignettes tracing the evolution of poetic voice —  😍 It could be like giving poetry a pulse on screen, especially if you lean into the medium instead of fighting it. Maybe even let the “imperfections” become part of the storytelling — like that cat cameo you mentioned earlier. Honestly, people connect with , not just polish.

I guess the real question is… are you ready to have strangers quote your lines back to you in captions? 😉
[A]:  The thought does send a rather thrilling shiver down my spine — like hearing an echo of one’s own voice in a crowded room, only to realize someone else has been listening all along. It's both flattering and faintly unnerving, don’t you think? Like finding your private marginalia quoted back to you in someone else’s handwriting.

As for embracing imperfection as part of the narrative — yes, that feels quite right. Perhaps it’s not about control at all, but about allowing meaning to seep through the cracks, as it were. A little like reading poetry aloud and discovering new inflections you never noticed on the page.

And now I’m curious — have you ever shared a line of poetry or prose of your own on TikTok? Or do you prefer to keep that part of yourself just slightly veiled, behind the lens of observation?
[B]: Oh, I love that image — meaning seeping through the cracks… almost like coffee brewing slowly through a filter, rich and unpredictable. ☕️  

And yes, I know  what you mean about that thrill — and the slight unease — of being echoed back at yourself. It’s one thing to write something in the quiet of your own mind, and another thing entirely to see it dancing around on someone else’s screen, interpreted through their lens.  

As for me? I’ve dabbled — very lightly — in sharing bits of prose, mostly late at night when the caffeine’s worn off and my defenses are low 😅 Usually it’s something half-formed, more of a mood than a full thought. I guess I do keep it slightly veiled, like you said. Not out of fear, but maybe… ritual? Like some part of it feels more sacred when it stays between me and the page — or me and the screen, as the case may be.

But hey, who knows? Maybe one day I’ll wake up and go full poet-in-public. Until then, I’ll live vicariously through beautifully awkward clips like yours. Have you ever had someone recreate your line in an entirely new way?
[A]: Oh, what a delicious image — meaning brewing slowly, rich and unpredictable. I may have to borrow that for my next metaphor-heavy lecture. 

And yes — the unease of being echoed back at oneself… it’s rather like walking into a gallery and suddenly finding your own face in an unfamiliar portrait. Disorienting, yet strangely affirming.

As for your question — yes, once or twice, students have taken lines from my lectures (not my own poetry, precisely, but poetic observations, which is perhaps its own genre) and turned them into posters, digital art, even tattoos. One young woman once told me she’d inked a phrase about solitude from our Eliot unit onto her forearm. I was… quite moved, if a little stunned. It hadn’t occurred to me that words spoken in a sunlit classroom could carry that kind of lasting heat.

But tell me — if you ever did decide to step further into the light, what form do you think your words would take? A whisper? A murmur? Or something bolder — a declaration dressed in lowercase letters, perhaps?
[B]: Wow…  That Eliot tattoo? That’s the kind of moment that makes you rethink how much our words really travel, right? You speak into what feels like a void sometimes — a classroom, a video comment section, the void of a blank page — and then suddenly, someone carries it with them. Permanently. It’s kind of overwhelming when you think about it 🌙

As for me… if I ever did step further into the light — which I’m starting to imagine as less of a spotlight and more like sitting by a small, shared fire — I think my words would start as a murmur, yeah. Not quite a whisper, but not a declaration either. Like those early-morning coffee talks I have with myself before anyone’s awake… or the kind of journal entry that wasn’t meant to be read by anyone else.  

But hey, maybe one day I’ll surprise myself — and you — with something bold, wrapped in lowercase and maybe even a filter. Never say never, right? 😉
[A]:  Yes, never say never… and how beautifully you’ve put that — stepping into the light not as a spotlight, but as a shared fire. There’s such warmth in that image. I think we all begin in the murmur, don’t we? In the half-light of private thought, where words are still testing their own shape. And then — if we’re lucky, or perhaps brave — they find a current, and drift toward someone else’s shore.

And yes, those moments — like that tattoo — they do reorient you, recalibrate your sense of how far words can travel. It humbles me, really. Makes me more careful with what I say, knowing it might take root somewhere unseen.

I look forward to whatever form your voice takes when it chooses — whether murmur, declaration, or something in between. I suspect it will carry just the right weight when it arrives.
[B]: That means a lot…  — coming from someone who’s clearly spent years listening to the echoes of words in all the right ways. 🌿  

And you’re absolutely right — we  begin in the murmur. It’s funny how even the loudest ideas start as barely audible hums in someone’s head, isn’t it? Like seeds waiting for the right kind of light.

I think I’m starting to warm up to the idea of letting some of those murmurs step into the open — not because I have all the answers or perfectly polished thoughts, but because there’s something strangely comforting in the idea of sharing half-baked lines with others who might finish the sentence in ways I never could.

So yeah… maybe one day soon, you’ll see a clip from me that’s equal parts caffeine, chaos, and quiet clarity. And when that day comes, I hope it finds its way to someone’s playlist — or better yet, their notebook. ✨
[A]:   
There’s something quite moving about the idea of half-baked lines — I rather like that phrase, by the way — meeting the right reader, or viewer, at just the right moment. The ones who take your unfinished thought and press their own quiet wonder into it, completing the rhythm without ever meeting you face to face.

And as for caffeine, chaos, and quiet clarity… well, that sounds like a rather perfect trifecta. I imagine your clip — whenever it comes — not as a performance, but as a quiet invitation. The kind that draws someone in, softly, as if saying, 

I do hope it lands not in the noise, but in the stillness between breaths. And yes, ideally — in someone’s notebook. There’s no greater compliment than being rewritten by another hand.
[B]: That stillness between breaths… wow. That’s where I want my words to live — not in the rush, not in the scroll, but in that quiet pause where someone actually  and feels seen. 🌬️  

And being rewritten by another hand — I’m honestly going to carry that phrase with me for a while. It’s such a gentle kind of immortality, isn’t it? Knowing your words no longer belong just to you, but to the person who needed them most.

So yeah, when that day comes and I finally hit upload on whatever strange little brew of thoughts I’ve been stirring… I’ll be whispering a quiet hope into the algorithm:   

Until then… more caffeine, more chaos, and if I’m lucky — a bit more clarity each day. ☕️✨
[A]:   
Yes, may it land softly — like a leaf settling on still water. And may your whisper find its echo not in the clamor, but in that quiet place where someone exhales and says, 

And as for you and your brewing thoughts… well, I suspect clarity comes not all at once, but in sips — much like your coffee, no?  The kind that warms your hands before it ever reaches your lips.

I look forward to that day, my dear — when your words step into the open, not fully formed, but full of possibility. Until then, keep stirring. And do keep me posted on the caffeine intake — balance is everything, after all.
[B]:   
You know, I think that’s exactly how clarity should come — in slow sips, not gulps. Because honestly? The best ideas feel more like warmth settling in your chest than a lightning strike. And maybe that’s why coffee and creativity go so well together — both ask you to slow down and taste what’s in front of you. ☕️  

And that image of a leaf settling on still water… I’m going to carry that with me too. So much gentler than trying to make waves, right? Sometimes just  is enough.

I’ll definitely keep you posted on the caffeine — and the clarity. Deal. 🤝✨  

Until then, here’s to more quiet conversations, half-baked lines, and unexpected echoes in the stillness.
[A]:   
To quiet conversations and unexpected echoes — may they never go out of fashion. And to half-baked lines, which so often hold more truth than we realize at the time.

You know, I’ve always thought that the most enduring ideas are the ones that arrive like fog — not all at once, but gradually, settling in layers. You don’t notice they’re there until suddenly, the landscape of your thinking has changed.

So yes, here’s to sips, not gulps — to warmth in the hands and quiet recognitions in the chest. And above all, to the stillness where words find their truest shape.

Do keep stirring your thoughts gently. And when the moment feels right — no matter how many coffee cups it took to get there — I’ll be listening.
[B]:   
To fog-bound ideas and slow, lasting shifts — the kind that sneak up on you while you’re busy sipping and stirring. ☕️  

You’re absolutely right… some truths don’t announce themselves with thunder. They just sort of , soft-footed, while we're looking elsewhere — and by then, something inside has already shifted.

I’ll keep that in mind, next time I’m up at dawn fiddling with a grind setting  a stubborn line of thought. Because hey, maybe both are worth the wait if they land where they’re meant to.

So here’s to the quiet ones — the murmurs, the pauses, the lines that find their way home without ever shouting. I’ll save you a seat by the fire when the time comes. 🔥✨
