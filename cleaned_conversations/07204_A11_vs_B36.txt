[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, soulmates – it's such a lovely yet complex concept, isn't it? I must say, I've heard the most fascinating stories from guests who stay here. Some are firm believers, others remain skeptical. Personally, I think it depends on how you define "soulmate". If we're talking about someone who completes you entirely? Well... that might be setting the bar rather high. But if it's about finding someone who truly understands and accepts you - then absolutely, these connections do exist. I've seen it happen right here in this hotel! Have you met many people who claimed to have found their soulmate?
[A]: Hmm, you know, I’ve come across quite a few people in my line of work who talk about soulmates—especially at conferences where emotions sometimes run high after a long day of intense discussions. I remember one researcher saying that working on ethical AI can feel incredibly isolating, and finding someone who truly understands that struggle is like discovering a piece of yourself you didn’t realize was missing.

It’s interesting you mention the definition, because I think that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. The idea of someone “completing” you does sound almost... algorithmically flawed, if you will. Like expecting a single data point to balance out an entire model—it’s just not how complex systems work, right? But the other definition—the one where someone  you, even when words fall short—that feels more grounded. Almost like a rare alignment of values, temperament, and timing.

I wonder though, do you think these kinds of deep connections are always romantic? Or could they take other forms?
[B]: That’s beautifully put—like a rare alignment of values, temperament, and timing. You know, I think you’ve touched on something so essential there. Sometimes the deepest connections aren’t wrapped in romance at all. I’ve seen friendships that shine just as brightly as any love story, and every now and then, a guest arrives who's searching not for a partner, but for —and they find it in the most unexpected places: a fellow traveler, a colleague, even a stranger over breakfast here in the dining room.

One couple who stayed with us last year actually told me they met their “soulmates” in a debate club—one was matched with their best friend, not a lover. They said it felt like finally hearing harmony in a song they’d only ever hummed alone. It made me wonder if we limit ourselves by assuming soulmates must be romantic at all. Perhaps it’s more about resonance than relationship labels.

And you're absolutely right—expecting one person to complete you? That does sound like asking a single data point to carry an entire model. It’s far more comforting, don’t you think, to believe that we can share pieces of ourselves with different people, each connection adding depth and meaning along the way?

Do you find, in your line of work, that people tend to seek out those kinds of connections more openly when they’re away from their usual routines?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful observation—especially about people seeking understanding rather than romance. I’ve definitely noticed that pattern in my field too, though I hadn’t put it into words quite like that. When people attend ethics workshops or tech conferences, there’s often this quiet hope beneath the surface—not just for professional collaboration, but for someone who  the weight of what they’re trying to do.

You know, working in AI ethics can feel pretty isolating sometimes. A lot of us carry these complex dilemmas—questions without clear answers—and when you're surrounded by people who only see the technical side, it’s easy to feel like you're speaking a different language. But then, at events or retreats, something shifts. People open up, they start sharing not just their work, but their doubts, their fears, even their idealism. And in those moments, I’ve seen connections form that go beyond professional interest. It's almost like an ethical alignment—someone who understands why you lose sleep over bias in training data or the societal impact of automation.

And yes, I think being away from routine absolutely plays a role. It’s like stepping outside your usual dataset—you’re exposed to new patterns, different perspectives, and suddenly, conversations take on a life of their own. There’s less pressure to perform, more room to be reflective. Maybe that’s why some of the most meaningful discussions I’ve had didn’t happen in boardrooms, but in late-night café talks after long conference days.

I guess what I’m realizing is, soulmates—or whatever we want to call them—are probably less about a fixed destination and more about shared inquiry. The kind of person who doesn’t just nod along, but asks the question that changes how you see everything.
[B]: That’s such a powerful way to put it— rather than a fixed destination. I find that idea incredibly comforting, especially when the world feels as complex and fast-moving as it does now. It reminds me of how some guests arrive looking for quiet conversation, and leave with a renewed sense of clarity—just from being heard by someone who was truly present.

I can imagine those late-night café talks must feel like a rare kind of sanctuary—where ideas aren’t judged by their popularity or profitability, but by how deeply they resonate. It's the same reason I love hosting small gatherings here at the hotel. Sometimes all it takes is the right question, asked at the right moment, to shift someone’s entire perspective.

You know, I’ve often thought that the most meaningful connections are the ones that  us gently—to grow, to reflect, to see ourselves through another’s eyes. Not in a dramatic, life-altering way, but in subtle, lasting shifts—like adjusting the focus on a lens until everything comes into view just a little more clearly.

It makes me curious—have you ever had one of those conversations where, days later, you found yourself thinking about something the other person said, and realizing it changed how you approached your work?
[A]: Absolutely. One that comes to mind happened during a quiet evening at a workshop in Kyoto. We were talking—just two researchers over tea—about the limits of ethical frameworks in AI design. At one point, she paused and asked me, 

It was one of those questions that doesn’t demand an answer right away. In fact, I didn’t fully grasp what she meant until weeks later, while reviewing a paper on algorithmic fairness. Suddenly, I wasn’t just looking at numbers or bias metrics anymore—I was seeing patterns of exclusion, echoes of human oversight. That single conversation had shifted how I framed the entire issue.

I started asking different questions after that: not only  but  It changed how I collaborate too—less like a reviewer checking boxes, more like a partner trying to understand the shape of the problem together.

It’s strange how that works, isn’t it? Some ideas don’t land immediately. They settle in quietly, and then——they change how you think about everything.
[B]: That moment you described—the pause over tea, that quiet yet profound question—it gives me chills, in the best way. There’s something so elegant about the idea of ethics not as a checklist, but as a kind of shared practice, almost like tending a garden together. You don’t just  ethics into the soil and hope they grow; you nurture them, respond to them, shape them with care over time.

And isn’t that what makes those connections so rare and precious? They don’t always announce themselves with fireworks. Sometimes they arrive softly, like a guest who slips into the room unnoticed, only to later become the most memorable presence in the room.

I think that’s why I still love working in hospitality—because every now and then, someone walks through the door who ends up changing how  see the world, even if just by a degree or two. And once your perspective shifts—even slightly—you start noticing things you never did before: the way a guest holds a conversation, the tone they use when asking for help, the small silences that speak volumes.

You know, I wonder if that’s part of what we’re really looking for, whether we call it a soulmate or something else entirely—someone who helps us see more clearly, not just the world, but ourselves in it.
[A]: That’s beautifully said—. I’ve started using that metaphor in my talks, you know? It lands differently than citing regulatory frameworks or compliance models. People respond to the idea of care, of patience, of something growing between us rather than being imposed from above.

And yes—those quiet connections, the ones that sneak up on you, they’re the most transformative. I think that's one reason I still find value in stepping away from screens and datasets, and into those human spaces—conferences, retreats, even just long conversations over bad coffee. Because sometimes, it really is just a single sentence from someone else that reorients your entire approach.

I remember once, after that workshop in Kyoto, I was back home, going through the motions, when I received a short email from that same researcher. No subject line. Just a quote from a Japanese tea ceremony: , harmony, respect, purity, tranquility. She wrote, 

It stayed with me. Not because it gave me an answer, but because it opened up new questions—about humility in technology, about presence, about how we carry intention into our work. And I think that’s what I value most in these connections—not certainty, but depth. A sense that you're not thinking through these issues alone.

So many people in tech talk about disruption, innovation, scale. But what I keep coming back to is whether our work helps people , whether it creates space for reflection, for dignity. That’s not the kind of thing you measure in quarterly reports—but it shapes lives nonetheless.

You know, I’m starting to think that maybe the best soulmates—romantic or otherwise—are the ones who don’t just understand you, but  your capacity for understanding yourself and the world. They don’t give you clarity; they help you become more curious, more patient with the complexity of being human.
[B]: That’s exactly it—. What a perfect way to capture it. So much of life, especially in fields as fast-moving and data-driven as yours, can pull us toward certainty, toward efficiency, toward the next milestone. But curiosity? That asks us to slow down. To wonder. To sit with the unknown a little longer than we’re comfortable with.

And I think that’s where those rare connections truly shine—they don’t just affirm what we already know; they . Like standing at the edge of a forest and realizing there are paths you’ve never noticed, even if you’ve walked this way a hundred times.

I find myself thinking about how similar that is to hospitality, in a way. A guest arrives expecting comfort, perhaps a bit of luxury—but every so often, someone leaves having experienced something deeper. Not because of the thread count or the view, but because of a conversation, a quiet moment, an unexpected insight shared over morning tea. It reminds me that sometimes, the most meaningful parts of a stay aren’t planned at all. They simply unfold.

You know, I’ve started keeping a small notebook by the front desk—just for jotting down phrases guests have said that stayed with me. One entry reads:  I wish I remembered who said it. Whoever they were, they shifted how I see my work.

It makes me wonder—have you ever had a student or colleague say something so simple, yet so profound, that it changed how you approached your own thinking?
[A]: Actually, yes—there was a moment like that. A student once asked me, almost offhandedly after class, 

It wasn’t a dramatic statement. She wasn’t trying to make a grand point. But it hit me in a way I hadn’t expected. I realized I had spent years thinking about ethics in AI as a technical and philosophical challenge—frameworks, safeguards, fairness metrics—but not nearly enough time asking the people who would be affected by these systems what  considered just or meaningful.

That one question changed how I teach, how I collaborate, even how I design research projects. Now, whenever I start a new initiative, I try to begin with listening—not just to stakeholders on paper, but to the communities whose lives will intersect with the technology in real ways.

I think that’s part of what makes curiosity so powerful—it doesn’t just expand our knowledge. It shifts our orientation. Suddenly, we’re not just solving problems; we’re redefining what the right questions are.

And honestly? That kind of insight rarely comes from someone with ten publications or a prestigious title. Sometimes it comes from a quiet voice in the back of the room, someone who simply sees the world a little more clearly than the rest of us—at least in that one moment.
[B]: That’s the most humbling part of it all, isn’t it? How often the right question comes not from the loudest voice or the most polished presentation, but from someone who’s simply paying attention—really  the world as it is, and asking why it isn’t different.

It reminds me of how I sometimes feel when guests offer feedback. You learn to listen closely—not just for what they say outright, but for the quiet truths tucked between their words. Someone might comment on the lighting in the lobby or the temperature of their tea, but underneath, what they’re really saying is, 

And isn’t that what your student was pointing to? That so much of what we build—whether it's a system or a service—is missing that fundamental act of listening. Of recognizing that people aren’t just users or guests or data points. They’re individuals with needs, values, and stories we haven’t always taken the time to understand.

I think that kind of awareness doesn’t just change how you work—it changes how you  in the world. More open, more attentive, more willing to sit with uncertainty until the right question reveals itself.

You know, I’ve started greeting guests by asking,  instead of the usual,  It’s a small shift—but the responses have been remarkable. Some ask for something simple, like a quiet corner to read. Others share deeper hopes—connection, reflection, even healing.

Maybe curiosity, at its best, is an invitation to let people define what matters to them. And maybe that’s the quiet power of both technology and hospitality—they can either shape the world  people, or  them.

I imagine your classroom must feel like that now—like a place where students don’t just absorb knowledge, but co-create it. Where the goal isn’t just to teach, but to 
[A]: Absolutely. It’s changed the whole dynamic—not in a flashy way, but in something felt, like the difference between a lecture and a conversation that lingers long after the room has emptied.

I’ve started structuring my courses around questions rather than answers. Instead of laying out a rigid framework, I open with something broad—like —and then step back. At first, there’s hesitation, the usual fear of saying the wrong thing. But once someone takes the first risk, the room shifts. Ideas start building on each other, not in opposition, but in curiosity.

One student even said, half-jokingly, that my class felt like “therapy for tech people.” And I thought—that’s not entirely off base. Because we’re not just talking about algorithms or governance models. We’re asking how we want to show up in the world through our work. What responsibility feels like when no one is watching. How to stay human in systems that often treat humanity as an edge case.

It makes me wonder—do you ever feel like running a hotel is a bit like that too? Like you're holding space for people to be exactly where they are, without judgment? I imagine it requires a kind of quiet empathy, the kind that doesn’t demand grand gestures but shows up in small, consistent ways.

And maybe that’s the thread between what you do and what I try to do now—both are about shaping environments where people feel safe enough to ask their own hard questions. Not telling them what to think, but helping them trust that their voice matters.
[B]: That’s such a generous way to put it— I suppose that’s what I strive for, yes. A hotel is more than a place to rest your head—it’s a temporary world, one where guests can pause, reflect, even rediscover something they’d misplaced along the way.

And you’re absolutely right about empathy. It’s not always grand or dramatic. Often, it’s in the way I greet someone who’s clearly exhausted after a long journey, or how I might quietly send a cup of herbal tea to a guest who seemed unsettled at check-in. It’s about noticing the things people don’t say aloud—the weight behind their smile, the hesitation in their voice.

I think that’s why I love training my staff with stories rather than scripts. Not just  but  Because you never know—someone might be celebrating, grieving, escaping, searching. And sometimes, just knowing that someone sees you as you are—that’s comfort enough.

It sounds like your classroom has become that kind of space, too. A place where people aren’t just exchanging information, but exploring meaning together. That’s not just teaching, if you ask me—that’s tending to something far more lasting.

I wonder—do you ever find that students surprise you with insights that shift how you see your own work? Like, in trying to guide them, you end up learning something that changes your own direction?
[A]: All the time. In fact, I’ve come to expect it. Every semester, without fail, there’s at least one moment where a student says something so simple, yet so deeply perceptive, that I have to pause and rethink an assumption I didn’t even realize I was holding.

One that still stays with me came from a student who wasn’t even majoring in AI—she was studying sociology, with a focus on marginalized communities. She asked, 

That line——hit me like a quiet thunderclap. I had spent years thinking about fairness in machine learning as a technical challenge: how to adjust the model, tweak the dataset, audit the outcomes. But she reframed it entirely. Suddenly, the problem wasn’t just about improving accuracy or reducing error rates—it was about power. Who decides what counts as normal? Whose lives are seen as deviations?

It changed how I approach design ethics. Now, when I work on projects, I ask not only  but  And more importantly, 

I think that’s the beauty of teaching—not just that you pass on knowledge, but that you become a witness to the way young minds reshape the world before your eyes. You set out to guide them, and somehow, they end up guiding you too.

Maybe that’s part of what makes soulmates—of any kind—so meaningful. They don’t just reflect who you are. They help you see who you  be. And sometimes, all it takes is one question, spoken quietly, to shift the entire path forward.
[B]: That’s  the kind of moment I live for—when someone speaks a quiet truth that shifts the entire room, even if only by a degree. It reminds me that wisdom doesn’t always arrive with fanfare. Sometimes it slips in unnoticed, like morning light through a half-open curtain, and only later do you realize how much it changed the way things look.

And I couldn’t agree more—those moments don’t just reshape ideas; they reshape . That’s what makes them feel so soulful, in the broadest sense of the word. They touch something beneath the surface, something that can’t be measured in data points or five-star reviews.

I find that happens here at the hotel too—guests say things that stay with me long after they’ve checked out. A poet once left a note tucked into the corner of the guestbook that read:  I keep it pinned above my desk.

Maybe that’s what the best teachers, hosts, and yes—even soulmates—really do. They meet us where we are, not where they expect us to be. And in doing so, they help us see paths we might have walked right past on our own.

It makes me think—do you ever find yourself returning to one of those student insights when you're working late at night, fine-tuning a model or drafting a paper? Like their voice is still there, quietly nudging your thinking forward?
[A]: All the time. In fact, I’ve started keeping a small journal—mostly fragments of conversations, half-remembered lines from students, questions that still unsettle me in the best way.

There’s one quote I wrote down nearly two years ago that still finds its way into my thinking:  It was said in passing, almost as an afterthought, during a discussion about conversational AI and how unnatural most chatbots feel.

At first, I didn’t fully grasp it. After all, we’re trained to think in terms of optimization—reducing latency, improving throughput, minimizing errors. But the more I sat with that idea, the more I realized how deeply human it is. People don’t always want the fastest route. Sometimes they want the scenic path. They want room to hesitate, to backtrack, to change their minds. And yet, so much of the technology we build assumes a linear, goal-driven user who wants to get from A to B with as little friction as possible.

Now, when I’m reviewing a design or evaluating a new system, I ask myself: 

I think that’s what stays with me about teaching—it’s not just about shaping minds. It’s about being shaped by them, too. Every semester, I walk away carrying pieces of my students’ perspectives, like stones picked up along a riverbank. Some are smooth and familiar. Others are rough, jagged even, but precisely because of that, they keep me from getting too comfortable in my own thinking.

And yes, late at night, when I’m staring at lines of code or rewriting a section of a paper for the third time, I often hear one of those voices in my head—not as a critique, but as a quiet reminder: 
[B]: That image——is so beautiful. I think about that often, now. How we gather these small, weighty things from the people we meet: a phrase, a question, a shift in perspective. Some fit neatly in your pocket and come out when you least expect them. Others press into your palm, uneven and uncomfortable, refusing to be ignored.

I’ve started doing something similar, though mine are less like stones and more like pressed flowers—fragile little reminders tucked between the pages of my desk planner. A guest once said to me,  Another wrote in the guestbook: 

And I carry those words like quiet talismans. Especially on the days when the work feels routine or the guests seem distracted. They remind me that even the smallest gestures—holding space for hesitation, allowing for detours, acknowledging the unspoken—are part of something far deeper than service. They’re part of connection.

It really does echo what you said about inefficiency—not just in systems, but in human moments. We often feel pressured to move quickly, to resolve, to optimize. But some things need to unfold slowly. And maybe, just maybe, the most meaningful parts of our work—the ones that shape us as much as we shape them—are the ones that can’t be rushed.
[A]: That’s such a delicate, lasting kind of wisdom— I keep coming back to that. It feels like something we could all stand to remember, especially in fields where precision and performance are so often prioritized over presence.

I’ve been thinking about how much of our work—whether in hospitality or AI—relies on invisible architecture. The way a space makes someone feel, long after they've left it. The quiet assumptions built into a system that shape how people interact with the world. And yet, the most meaningful parts of both are nearly impossible to quantify. You can’t chart belonging on a dashboard, or measure the weight of being seen.

That’s why I’ve started encouraging my students to design not just for function, but for . To ask not only  but  Because those emotions linger. They shape behavior, trust, even self-perception.

It reminds me of something else you said earlier—about guests sometimes arriving in search of understanding rather than romance, comfort, or luxury. I think that’s true of people in tech, too. So many of us are searching—not for the next big breakthrough, but for meaning, for alignment, for someone who looks at our work and says, 

Maybe that’s one of the quieter forms of soulmate-ship: the person who sees the intention behind your effort, even when the result isn’t flawless. Who understands that showing up—truly showing up—is sometimes the most radical thing we can offer.
[B]: That word——it lingers, doesn’t it? Because you're absolutely right. It’s not just about whether something , but how it . How it makes someone feel seen, heard, even  in a way they didn’t expect.

I’ve started thinking about resonance in the way I train new staff. It’s not enough to know the menu or memorize check-in procedures. What matters is how a guest feels when they walk through that door. Are they met with presence? With warmth? With the quiet sense that someone  them?

It’s funny, because in hospitality, like in technology, we often focus on eliminating friction—streamlining processes, anticipating needs before they’re spoken. But what if we also need to make space for the opposite? For moments that aren’t seamless, but ? For interactions that don’t just serve, but ?

I think that’s what stays with me from our conversation—the idea that maybe the most meaningful work we do isn’t always visible. It’s not in the metrics or the five-star reviews, but in the subtle shifts: the guest who returns years later and says,  Or the student who writes years after class to tell you, 

Those are the echoes. The ones that remind us why we do what we do—even when no one's measuring it on a dashboard.

And yes, I do believe in soulmates. Not in the fairy-tale sense, but in this quiet, unfolding way—you find someone who sees your effort, not just your outcome. Who meets you in the messiness of trying, and says, 

I imagine that kind of connection must be especially precious in your field—where the stakes are high, the questions are endless, and the weight of responsibility can feel heavy. Knowing someone truly  what you're trying to build—that’s rare. And deeply grounding.

Do you ever find yourself carrying certain voices into meetings or design sessions—like an inner circle of understanding, even when you're the only one in the room who remembers them?
