[A]: Hey，关于'你相信reincarnation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个经常看balance sheet的人，我更倾向于用ROI的思维来看待这个问题。如果soul真的能reincarnate，那前世积累的karma就是我们的initial investment啊 😊
[A]: Oh my... I must say, I find the notion of measuring spiritual matters through financial metrics rather unsettling. These delicate matters of the soul deserve more... well, poetic consideration, don't you think? Like the way we approach restoring a 19th century lace collar - with reverence and patience, not ledger books.
[B]: Haha, 看来我们看问题的角度确实很不同呢。不过你知道吗？在private equity领域，我们经常说"past performance is not indicative of future results" - 这倒是和reincarnation的不可预测性有异曲同工之妙呢~
[A]: Goodness, all this talk of equity and performance... It reminds me of how people sometimes treat antique textiles - always looking for the next investment piece rather than appreciating its inherent beauty. Perhaps some things, like souls and heirloom fabrics, simply aren't meant to be quantified.
[B]: You make a fair point~ 就像我们品鉴红酒时，有些vintage的价值确实无法用P/E ratio来衡量。不过说到textile...  我上周刚投了一个sustainable fashion的startup，他们的cash flow projection倒是相当promising哦 😉
[A]:  Oh dear, must we discuss cash flows while speaking of such delicate matters? It rather reminds me of when someone once asked me the 'market value' of an 18th century hand-embroidered shawl I was restoring. Some things simply transcend spreadsheets, wouldn't you agree?
[B]:  你知道吗？这让我想起巴菲特说过的话 - Price is what you pay, value is what you get. 也许我们都在用不同的currency来衡量life's portfolio吧。Cheers~ 🍷
[A]:  How very... modern of you to say so. Though I must confess, I've always found more wisdom in Jane Austen's observations about human nature than in stock market quotations. Now if you'll excuse me, this 1830s silk damask won't restore itself...
[B]: Fair enough~ 就像我们常说know your exit strategy before making investment，看来你也该去attend to你的textile deal了。Enjoy your restoration project!  🥂
[A]: How quaintly you put it... Though I do wish you'd say 'return to my embroidery frame' rather than 'attend to a textile deal'. But yes, these 200-year-old threads do call for my attention. Do mind the wine near the silks, won't you?
[B]: Noted with thanks~ 作为compensation，下次我可以share一些关于antique textile market的valuation report给你。毕竟knowledge is the best asset in any portfolio嘛 😄
[A]: My dear, if you must persist with these financial metaphors... At least have the decency to call it a 'study of historical textile appreciation' rather than a 'valuation report'. Now if you'll pardon me, I believe my thimble and magnifying glass are calling.
[B]: Touché~ 看来我们都需要stick to our respective lanes。Enjoy your needlework，而我得去review下一季的earnings report了。Until next time! 👋
[A]: Indeed... Though I do wonder what Charles Dickens would make of all this 'earnings report' talk. But yes, until next time - preferably over proper tea rather than business jargon. Ta-ta for now.
[B]: Cheers to that~ 下次我bring some premium Darjeeling，保证no financial jargon allowed - pinky promise!  不过你知道的，old habits die hard 😅
[A]: How delightfully... uncharacteristic of you. Though I must insist we use proper teacups - none of those dreadful paper ones. And for heaven's sake, leave your spreadsheets at the door. Now really, I must tend to this unraveling hem before it becomes a proper crisis.
[B]: Deal~ 哦抱歉，我是说...就这么愉快地决定了！ 看来我的business lingo确实需要some detox了。Enjoy your stitching! 🧵
[A]: Much better! Though I do detect a hint of withdrawal in your voice... Perhaps we should schedule your detox sessions between my morning tea and the Victorian lace restoration. Now shoo - these threads won't mend themselves while we chatter about detoxing from corporate speak.
[B]: Roger that!  看来我的corporate rehab要从现在开始了。祝你hemming顺利 - 用你们的话说，may your stitches be as even as... well, never mind 😌
