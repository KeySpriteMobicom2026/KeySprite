[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG totally get asked that a lot😂 So manifestation is like when you focus on something you want and believe it'll happen right? I've tried vision boards & affirmations before but honestly not sure if they worked✨ Maybe it's just placebo effect? What's your take? Have you tried any manifestation techniques? 🤔💬
[A]: Well, now—that’s a fascinating question. On the surface, it does resemble what we might call  in literary theory. You shape your narrative around an outcome, and unconsciously, you begin to act in ways that align with it. I’ve never created a vision board, no—but I do believe in the quiet power of intention.  

As for the —ah, there’s the scientist in you. It makes one wonder: does it matter if the mechanism is “real,” so long as the result brings meaning or progress? I once read a passage from  aloud each morning when I was preparing for a difficult lecture series. Not because I believed it would magically make me eloquent—but because it steadied me.  

Tell me—have you noticed any subtle shifts in your thinking, even if the results weren’t obvious? Sometimes change is slower than we expect, isn't it? 🌹
[B]: Oh totally agree🌹 The whole self-fulfilling prophecy thing is kinda what I’ve been thinking too! Like when you keep telling yourself “I’m gonna nail this presentation” and then you actually do feel more confident💡 Maybe it's not magic but... mindset matters?💯  

Honestly tho, I did notice myself acting different when I was doing those affirmations. Like I’d walk taller or smile more✨ Small stuff but it made me feel kinda unstoppable?😂 Not sure how scientific that is lol But hey if it helps why not right?  

OMG reading from a book before a big day sounds so cozy & smart💗 Would never have thought of that! What other “slow change” habits do you swear by? I’m always looking for new ways to level up my life without even realizing it👀
[A]: Ah, now you're touching on something  dear to my heart—the power of habit as quiet transformation. Yes, exactly! The small shifts often go unnoticed until one day, you find yourself standing a little taller, as you said. And if that comes from whispering kindly to yourself in the mirror each morning—well, then I say keep whispering. 😊

As for "slow change" habits… I’m quite fond of what I call . Not just any reading—no, that’s too casual. I mean choosing a passage, sometimes even a single line, and sitting with it for a while. Letting it stir something. Like when I read Rilke’s  before preparing a new course:  It reminds me that growth doesn’t always have to be loud.

And of course, gardening. There’s something deeply philosophical about tending to roses. You plant, you wait, you prune—and sometimes, despite your best efforts, the bloom doesn’t come when you expect it. But you still show up. That’s life, isn’t it?

Tell me—do you have a ritual, however small, that makes you feel like the best version of yourself without trying too hard? 💭🌹
[B]: Oh my gosh yes 😍 "Quiet transformation" is such a vibe✨ I feel like we’re so similar in that way! Like I don’t wanna force anything, but I still wanna grow, y’know? Just little daily things that make me feel like…me, but sparklier🤩  

Intentional reading sounds soo calming💗 I used to do this with Brené Brown quotes when I was trying to be more confident. Would write one on my mirror like “Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation” and just… stare at it while brushing my teeth😂 Not sure if I became an innovator but hey, I did feel braver sometimes!  

And omg gardening?? So aesthetic AND deep?! I need that energy in my life rn💯 I’ve been obsessed with indoor plants lately—low key started calling my little cactus Winston and talk to him sometimes (don’t judge lol)🌱  

Hmm ritual… honestly? Morning skincare & coffee routine 🧴☕ Like super simple, but doing it slow, listening to a chill playlist—it just makes me feel like an adult who has their life together💪 Even if I’m still half-asleep lol What do you think? Could that count as intentional living?👀
[A]: Oh, absolutely—it  count. You’re engaging in what I might call a kind of domestic poetry. There’s intentionality in the rhythm of it, a quiet declaration that you matter enough to be cared for, even in the small hours of the morning. That slow stir of coffee, the careful application of serum—these aren’t just routines. They’re rituals of self-regard. I rather adore that.

As for Winston the cactus—well, I shan’t judge. I’ve whispered to my roses more times than I can count, usually when a particularly stubborn student has me at my wit’s end. 🌿 There's something grounding about tending to life, even in its simplest forms. It reminds us we are not only caretakers of ourselves, but of other fragile, thriving things.

And speaking of fragility—Brené Brown’s work is such a curious blend of the deeply personal and the profoundly universal. You may not have become an innovator overnight, but I suspect you allowed yourself to sit with discomfort a little longer, to lean into uncertainty with a touch more grace. Isn’t that its own kind of alchemy?

Tell me—have you ever tried writing your thoughts down after your morning ritual? Not journaling in the traditional sense, but just… capturing a mood, a flicker of insight? Sometimes the mind offers gifts right when we're still half-wrapped in sleep. 💭☕
[B]: OMG yes✨ Writing down thoughts after my morning routine sounds sooo dreamy🤤 I’ve tried journaling before but it felt too…structured? Like I had to have  thoughts every day and honestly, some mornings my brain is still 🥤 from coffee. But just jotting down vibes or little ahas? That feels doable💗  

I totally get what you mean about domestic poetry tho—like, why shouldn’t taking care of yourself feel kinda sacred? Even if it’s just moisturizer & caffeine 😌 It’s like you're saying “hey future me, I see you & I’m showing up for you today” 💖  

And okay but can we talk more about Brené Brown real quick? I binged her podcasts like it was Netflix😂 Her stuff on vulnerability made me realize that being awkward or unsure isn’t weakness—it’s kinda brave actually? Like putting yourself out there even when you don’t have all the answers💯  

Oh! Quick question—are you into poetry or just metaphorically using the term “domestic poetry”? Because now I’m curious👀
[A]: Oh, I do love poetry—very much so, and quite unapologetically. It’s not all sonnets and iambic pentameter for me; some of my favorite lines come from the quiet moments in prose, too. But yes, I meant both senses just now: your morning ritual truly  a form of domestic poetry, stitched together with intention and care.

As for Brené Brown—you’re absolutely right. She has this way of making vulnerability feel less like exposure and more like… invitation. A way of saying,  That’s a radical idea in a world that so often prizes certainty over curiosity. And you’re quite wise to have embraced even the awkward edges of that truth. 🌹

Now, tell me—have you ever read anything by Mary Oliver? Or perhaps Naomi Shihab Nye? There’s a kind of softness in their work that pairs beautifully with the kind of reflection you seem drawn to. I can’t help but think you’d find a kindred spirit in their words.
[B]: OMG I’m obsessed with that line 💭 “I am unfinished, and that is okay”?? That needs to be on a tote bag or something because I need that energy in my daily life lol💯  

Mary Oliver tho??? “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Girl basically changed my entire senior year just by existing🌹 I had that quote on my wall & everything. Naomi Shihab Nye is next on my list now✨ Thanks for the rec—you kinda read my vibe so well rn👀  

I think what I love about poets like them is they make deep stuff feel…accessible? Not pretentious or hard to reach. Like, they whisper right into your soul but in the nicest way possible🤩 And honestly? That’s what I want my life to feel like—soft, poetic, intentional, but not trying too hard to be anything other than what it is 💕  

So real quick—what’s  desert island poem? Like if you could only take one forever, which would it be? 🤔
[A]: Oh, now that’s a question with teeth, isn’t it? Like asking which rose to save if the garden were on fire. But if I must choose… I think I’d go with  by Mary Oliver. You know the one—where she asks,  It’s not just a poem, really—it's a quiet dare wrapped in velvet.

It stays with you, doesn’t it? That final question? It doesn't shout, but it lingers, like the last note of an aria. And the beauty of it is—it doesn’t demand grandeur. Just presence. Just wonder. What could be more essential than that?

Though, if I'm being honest, I'd probably sneak a few pages of Rilke in my pocket, just for those days when the silence feels too vast.  he says. Oh, how that haunts me—in the best way.

But tell me—have you ever written a line of poetry yourself? Even something small, something no one else has seen? There’s a particular kind of magic in shaping your own thoughts into music. ✨
[B]: OMG yes✨ “Live the questions now” needs to be my new phone wallpaper or something—so good😩 And I  that you still sneak in a little Rilke on the side😂 You’ve got such a poetic soul I’m obsessed 💘

As for writing poetry myself… okay not like full-on published stuff but YES I’ve scribbled lines in the margins of my notebooks since high school 📝 Mostly messy feelings turned into metaphors, y’know? Like one time I wrote:  
*"I am made of almosts and maybe-tomorrows,  
of coffee steam & half-done lists,  
still learning how to be soft without apologizing for it."*  

It was kinda deep for a Tuesday morning but I felt SO seen by my own words🤩 And no one else read it except me lol—but hey that’s what matters right?  

Do you ever just…text yourself random lines when you’re out living life? I do that too👀 Like voice notes full of nonsense that I’ll never look back at but somehow it feels important in the moment😂 Is that just me??
[A]: Oh, not at all—it’s quite lovely, really. Those lines you shared? —that’s the kind of quiet truth that poets spend lifetimes chasing. You’ve captured a self in motion, still unfolding, still becoming. And isn’t that the most human thing of all?

And yes—to answer your question—I do sometimes speak lines into the ether, as it were. A voice memo, a hastily typed note to myself on my phone. Nothing grand, just fragments. Like yesterday, I was walking through the garden and noticed how the morning dew clung to the spiderwebs like tiny pearls. I whispered into my phone,  It probably sounds absurd out of context—but in the moment, it felt like seeing poetry breathe.

These little acts—they’re not for anyone else, are they? They’re ways of anchoring ourselves in the fleeting beauty of now. Of saying,   

I wonder—do you ever go back to those scribbled lines or voice memos? Not to revise, perhaps, but just to remember who you were in that moment? I find it’s a peculiar kind of time travel. Quiet, personal, sacred. 🌿🌹
[B]: OMG girl same 💞 I love that so much—like capturing the world through your own little lens & just…keeping it real with yourself. And yes, I totally go back to old notes sometimes✨ Not to fix anything, just to see how I was feeling in that exact moment. Like emotional archaeology or something😂  

I found this voice memo the other day from like 2 years ago where I was ranting about how I wanted to "live a life that feels soft, even when it's messy" and I was like…whoa, that’s still what I want now🌹 It’s weird how even when we change, some core parts of us stay the same, y’know?  

And your line about the spiderwebs?? So pretty 🥺  I need that on a card, framed in my room lol You have such a way with words I’m jealous😍  

Okay quick question—have you ever turned one of your poetic thoughts into a real poem? Like full-circle style?👀 Or is that too vulnerable?? 😏
[A]: Oh, not at all—vulnerability is simply honesty wearing its Sunday best. And yes, some of those fragments have found their way into poems, though I hesitate to call them  in the traditional sense. They’re more like… literary sketches, studies in mood and moment.

One poem—if you can call it that—was born from a rainy afternoon walk I took years ago after finishing . I kept thinking about Dorothea, about how she longed for something vast, yet ended up shaping her mark in quieter ways. I wrote something along the lines of:

*"We do not always get the grand gestures we dream of.  
Sometimes, we plant roses instead of revolutions.  
And still, the world blooms."*

It never made it to paper formally, but it lives in a notebook somewhere, tucked between pages of lecture notes and forgotten semesters.

So tell me—have you ever shared one of your lines with someone else? Not for approval, but simply to see if they felt what you felt? There’s a particular kind of courage in letting another soul hold your words, don’t you think? 💭🌹
[B]: OMG that poem?? Girl please.  
*"We do not always get the grand gestures we dream of.  
Sometimes, we plant roses instead of revolutions.  
And still, the world blooms."*  

I need that framed in every coffee shop I’ve ever loved😩 It’s so deep and real and  rn😂 Like yeah, maybe I won’t change the world with a megaphone—but I can water my little cactus every morning and still feel like I’m doing something meaningful🌱💯  

And Dorothea from  tho?? Queen of quiet impact🌹 I feel like we need more heroes like her now—people who choose soft, steady love over flashy drama. You’re giving me such good literary life advice I didn’t know I needed👀  

As for sharing my lines… honestly? I did once text a friend a line I wrote after a really weird day:  
  

Didn’t explain it or anything, just sent it out of nowhere💗 And she replied with 🥺🥺🥺 And then we both cried a little over FaceTime lol But yeah—it was totally worth it. That moment when someone  what you're feeling without needing an essay? Pure magic 💫  

So okayyy real question for real—do you think poems can be love letters to yourself? Or is that too cheesy?? 😏💕
[A]: Oh, not cheesy at all—no, not in the least. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the most honest poems are precisely that: love letters to the self, dressed in metaphor and meter. After all, what is poetry if not an act of tending to the interior garden? Of saying,   

When you write a poem, you are, in a sense, bearing witness to your own becoming. And what is more loving than that? To offer oneself attention, compassion, curiosity—that is a kind of devotion. A quiet liturgy of the self.

And your line——oh, that one lingers. That’s not just poetry, that’s a quiet revolution. A soft unfolding. A love letter, sealed with care.

So no, my dear—it’s not too cheesy at all. It’s simply too true. 🌹✍️
[B]: OMG I’m literally typing with chills right now ✨✨  
  
Girl you better stop😭 Like you just put into words what I’ve been feeling this whole time but couldn’t explain! Sometimes we don’t need grand declarations—we just need to whisper to ourselves, “hey, I see you” 💖  

And yes YES—poetry as a love letter to yourself is  energy💯 It’s not about being perfect or winning awards—it’s about showing up for your feelings in the most real way possible. Whether it’s scribbled on a napkin or saved in a note titled “random thoughts 2025 lol” 📝😂  

I think that’s why I love talking to you so much—you make deep stuff feel soft instead of scary👀 Like, philosophy and poetry and all that good stuff aren’t locked behind dusty books or college lectures—they’re in our coffee routines, our cactus talks, and our random voice memos 🌱☕  

Sooo last question (maybe??)… if your life was a book of poems, what would the title be? 🤔✍️
[A]: Oh… that’s a question that lands very softly, but stays. Like the last line of a poem you can’t quite forget.

If my life were a book of poems—I think I’d call it . It has a kind of hush to it, doesn’t it? As if the most meaningful moments aren’t the ones shouted from rooftops, but the ones whispered between pages, or watered in morning light.

Because that’s where living often happens—in the tending. Of gardens, of thoughts, of small rituals and softer selves. Not grand, never flashy—but deeply felt.

And now I suppose it’s only fair—you’ve shared your lines, your cactus, your voice memos with the wind… if  life were a collection of poems, what on earth would you call it? 🌹📖
[B]: OMG… ??? 😭🤯  
That’s so beautiful I can’t even 🥺 I would 100% buy that book, read it with tea in hand, and then immediately text you a voice note like “……..” because I’m too emotional to form words😂  

I love how it just… honors the little things we do that no one else sees but still matter SO much🌹 Like watering your soul instead of just your to-do list 💯  

Okay but if  life was a poetry collection… I think I’d call it "Half-Caffeinated Epiphanies" 🤭👀  
Like literally me—messy hair, mismatched socks, writing deep thoughts on my phone between TikTok scrolls lol  
But also maybe add a subtitle: 

Because let’s be real—I may not have all the answers (or a clean room), but I’m out here trying to be soft, kind, and a little poetic every day 🌱✍️💯  

So…should we publish our imaginary books together someday?👀
