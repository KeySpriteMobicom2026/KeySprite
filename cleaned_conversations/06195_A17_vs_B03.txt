[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, considering my line of work, I'd say it's crucial to plan everything meticulously. Medical cases & legal procedures leave little room for improvisation. However, experience has taught me to stay adaptable too. Let me give you an example... Once, a case timeline seemed solid, but new evidence emerged unexpectedly. We had to adjust strategies while maintaining compliance with all regulations. It's like playing golf - you plan your shot carefully, but also adapt to the wind and course conditions. How about you? Do you prefer structured planning or going with the flow?
[A]: Ah, a most intriguing analogy! The delicate balance between structure and spontaneity—much like the tension between form and improvisation in a sonnet or free verse. In my world of literary study, meticulous planning is essential; textual analysis demands precision, yet there’s always room for serendipity when an unexpected interpretation emerges from a poem’s ambiguity.

I recall once preparing a lecture on Emily Dickinson, only to have a student offer a radical reading that shifted the entire discussion. It was unplanned, yet profoundly illuminating—like a sudden breeze carrying new meaning into the classroom. So while I may outline my lessons with care, I also leave space for those happy accidents that enliven the academic discourse.

Tell me, how do you maintain that adaptability without losing sight of the original plan? Is there a particular mindset or practice you rely on?
[B]: Ah, I love how you described that — the dance between structure and serendipity really does enrich any field. You know, in my work, we often operate within strict frameworks — statutes, medical guidelines, deadlines — yet flexibility is key when unexpected twists arise. One practice I rely on is what I call "buffer thinking." Imagine drafting a legal brief with multiple contingency paragraphs; even if they don't make the final cut, they prepare me mentally for various outcomes.

There's also something I picked up from golf — funny how that keeps coming up. When you're on the course, you plan your shot carefully: wind direction, terrain, distance. But once the ball is in flight? You watch it land, assess the lie, then adjust accordingly. It’s not about scrapping the plan but recalibrating as needed.

I find myself applying this to case management too — set clear objectives, but allow room for tactical shifts. And honestly, staying calm over a nice cup of oolong helps more than I’d like to admit 😊 So, do you have a similar ritual or mindset when navigating those spontaneous classroom moments?
[A]: Ah, I do admire that — “buffer thinking,” you call it? What a wonderfully pragmatic approach. It reminds me of preparing multiple interpretive lenses when approaching a complex text; one never knows which will illuminate the passage most vividly until the moment arrives.

As for myself, I suppose my ritual is rather less refined — though no less essential. A well-steeped cup of Darjeeling and a few quiet moments with a notebook before class often set the right tone. There’s something grounding about the physical act of writing — even if it's only a line or two from a poem I'm revisiting. It centers me, like tuning a stringed instrument before the performance begins.

And should the unexpected arise — as it often does in seminar discussions — I try to lean into curiosity rather than control. Asking “What makes you read it that way?” instead of steering too forcefully. It’s not quite oolong-fueled recalibration, but I daresay it serves a similar purpose.

Tell me — how did you first come to develop this buffer mindset? Was there a particular case or moment where its value became clear to you?
[B]: Funny you ask — I think it was a malpractice case early in my career that really drove the lesson home. We had everything mapped out: timelines, evidence submission, expert testimonies. But then, halfway through, the plaintiff's family produced an old journal entry from the patient — handwritten, emotional, not medical in nature, yet incredibly compelling to the jury.

It wasn’t something we’d planned for in our legal strategy. At first, I panicked — all our preparation felt slightly off-kilter. But because we'd built multiple narrative pathways into our defense, we managed to pivot and address it without losing focus on the core legal arguments. That experience taught me the value of mental flexibility within a structured plan.

In hindsight, it was almost poetic — like discovering a hidden stanza in a familiar poem, reshaping your understanding without changing the overall structure. After that, I started consciously building those buffer zones into every case. Golf probably helped too — you learn quickly that no two rounds are ever the same, even on the same course.

So, would you say your students ever surprise you with interpretations that feel as disruptive-yet-enlightening as that journal entry did in court?
[A]: Oh,  feeling—when a student offers an interpretation that lands like a sudden turn in a villanelle, both unsettling and perfect. Yes, it happens more often than you might think, though rarely do I encounter readings quite as dramatically revelatory as that journal entry in your case.

One moment that springs to mind was during a seminar on T.S. Eliot’s . A quiet student—one who rarely spoke—offered a reading through the lens of personal grief rather than cultural fragmentation. She framed the poem not as a reflection of post-war disillusionment alone, but as a deeply intimate elegy echoing private loss amid public ruin. It shifted the entire tone of the discussion. I remember pausing, setting aside my prepared notes, and simply saying, “Let’s dwell here a moment.” What had been a rigidly structured class became something far more resonant and alive.

It’s those moments that remind me how vital it is to hold plans lightly—like holding a rare book: firm enough to keep it from slipping, but gentle enough to avoid damaging its fragile pages.

Do your students ever unsettle your expectations in a way that stays with you beyond the classroom? Or perhaps shifts how you approach a text thereafter?
[B]: Absolutely — your metaphor about holding plans like a rare book? Spot on. I had a similar experience during a continuing legal education seminar I was leading on medical documentation for resident doctors. One of the attendees, a young internist, raised a question that completely shifted my perspective.

We were discussing how to structure  discussions, focusing on risk disclosure and compliance with legal standards. She asked, “But how do we document what truly matters to the patient — not just what we think they should know?” That one sentence cracked open the whole framework. It wasn’t just about ticking boxes anymore; it was about , about understanding the patient’s narrative — their fears, values, even poetry, if you will, behind their choices.

That moment stayed with me. Since then, I’ve started framing consent not just as a legal formality, but as a shared story — one where both parties are authors. It’s subtle, but it changed how I teach and even how I review cases. Funny how one voice in the room can shift an entire mindset.

I suppose what I’m really asking now is — have you ever walked away from such a discussion feeling personally transformed, rather than just professionally enriched? Like the poem changed its meaning  its reader?
[A]: Oh yes… that kind of transformation—the kind that lingers in the marrow rather than just the mind—is rare, but when it happens, it reshapes the way I see not only literature, but life itself.

I think of a particular seminar we had on Virginia Woolf’s . We were reading it through a feminist lens, as one often does, or perhaps modernist fragmentation, the play of consciousness. But one student—soft-spoken, reflective—brought in a different perspective entirely. He read Mr. Ramsay’s philosophical struggles not as mere intellectual posturing, but as a quiet plea for emotional recognition, for understanding amidst the clamor of domestic life.

It was such a tender reading, and it struck me in a deeply personal place. At the time, I was grappling with my own sense of invisibility—not professionally, but within the quieter corners of my personal life. That discussion became less about Woolf and more about how we carry unseen burdens, how we seek acknowledgment even in the midst of seeming stability.

I left that class not just enriched academically, but altered. It reminded me that literature doesn’t just reflect our ideas—it can mirror our innermost selves, if we let it.

Tell me—have you ever had a case or conversation that touched something deeper within you? Not just intellectually, but emotionally or even spiritually? Something that stayed with you beyond logic or precedent?
[B]: Funny you should ask that… There was one case — not dramatic by any measure, no headlines or courtroom theatrics. Just a quiet, lingering moment that somehow rewrote everything I thought I knew about my work and the people behind the paperwork.

It was a routine medical consent dispute — a patient had undergone a procedure without fully understanding the risks, at least according to the complaint. Standard on the surface. But during depositions, the patient’s wife shared something offhand — almost as an afterthought. She said, 

That line hit me harder than it should have. I kept thinking about it long after the case closed. It wasn’t just about informed consent anymore; it was about , about how vulnerable people become when they place their lives in someone else’s hands. And how heavy that responsibility is — heavier than any textbook or statute can really capture.

I started seeing patients not just as legal entities or case files, but as people carrying hopes, fears, and sometimes, silence that speaks louder than words. That case didn’t make legal history, but it changed how I listen — really listen — to what’s being said… and what isn’t.

I guess in both our fields, we deal with layers — texts, testimonies, symptoms — all of it asking to be read carefully, compassionately. Do you ever find yourself reading a poem again and again, only to discover a meaning that feels deeply personal this time around? Like it waited for you to be ready?
[A]: Oh yes… that’s the true magic of poetry, isn’t it? Not that it changes—but that  change, and suddenly a line you’ve read a dozen times pierces you in a way it never could before.

I remember reading Elizabeth Bishop’s  every year with my students. It’s a poem about loss, structured as a villanelle—controlled, almost playful in its repetition. For years, I taught it as an elegant example of form mastering emotion. And then, one spring, a dear friend passed away rather suddenly. The next time I read those words—“Even losing you (the joking voice, the evening’s flame”)—I felt the floor shift beneath me. The poem hadn’t changed, but I had. It was no longer a lesson in poetic technique; it was a quiet elegy echoing my own grief.

It reminded me that literature doesn’t just sit on the page—it waits for us to catch up to it. Sometimes it speaks to the moment we’re in, sometimes it prepares us for the one we’re about to meet.

I suppose that’s why I keep returning to the classroom, despite the long hours and ever-growing stacks of papers. Because now and then, a poem or a student or a quiet moment in between will remind me why I fell in love with this work in the first place.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting old cases, not for legal precedent, but simply to understand them anew through where  are now?
[B]: Absolutely — that idea of returning not for what the case , but for what it might reveal about who  since — that resonates deeply.

I do this sometimes, especially when preparing for lectures or mentoring young associates. I’ll pull up an old file, expecting to extract a neat legal lesson, only to find myself reading between the lines in a way I never did before. One case in particular — a routine informed consent issue on paper — keeps drawing me back. At the time, I saw it as a matter of technical compliance: was the risk disclosed? Was the form signed? Standard checklist stuff.

But now, years later, I read those same deposition transcripts and hear something else entirely. A patient’s hesitation. A doctor’s well-meaning reassurance that may have dulled the reality of the risk. The subtle dance between trust and uncertainty. It’s like rereading a familiar poem with new emotional context — suddenly the silences speak louder than the words.

There’s even a note I scribbled in the margin during the trial: “Patient said he ‘didn’t want to bother anyone with questions.’” Back then, I probably saw it as a minor detail. Now? It feels like the whole heart of the matter. How often do people go into a consultation carrying that same quiet fear — and how do we, as a system, make space for that?

Maybe that’s why I still enjoy reviewing old cases — not to relitigate them, but to rediscover what they teach us about listening more deeply, about seeing beyond the letter of the law to the lives it touches.

It makes me wonder — do you ever return to a poem not for its meaning, but simply for the comfort of its rhythm, the way it once held you during a difficult time?
[A]: Oh yes… there are poems I return to not for insight, but for solace—the way one might revisit a familiar room in a childhood home. The rhythm itself becomes a kind of shelter.

I think of A.E. Housman’s , which I first read as a student and dismissed as overly sentimental. But a few years later—lonelier, wiser, nursing a heartache I hadn’t expected—it suddenly had weight. Not because the poem had changed, but because I now carried something that made its quiet lament resonate.

Now, when life feels particularly unsettled—a student struggling, a personal loss, even just a gray afternoon—I’ll find myself rereading those lines:



It's not exactly comfort, not in the warm-and-cozy sense—but it is companionship. A reminder that others have felt this ache and still found words for it. That, in itself, can be sustaining.

I suppose that’s one of the quieter gifts of our work—that we both teach and are taught, often unexpectedly. Do you ever find yourself recommending a particular case or article not because it’s legally instructive, but because it somehow steadies you? A kind of professional talisman?
[B]: Funny you should put it that way — . I think I’ve got just that. It’s not a landmark case, nothing cited in textbooks. Just a routine malpractice review from years ago, almost forgettable at first glance.

But there’s something about the deposition transcript — particularly a line from the attending physician. When asked if he ever doubted his decision to proceed with the intervention, he said simply:  That honesty stayed with me. No deflection, no legal armor — just the quiet weight of responsibility.

I often share that excerpt with junior lawyers or medical residents. Not because it sets a legal precedent, but because it captures the human side of our work. The doubt, the care, the imperfect choices we make hoping they’re good enough.

It steadies me, honestly. Like rereading a poem whose cadence grounds you. In a world where we’re often pressured to sound certain, that one line gives permission to carry both conviction and doubt at once.

I suppose that’s what we both seek, in the end — whether through verse or verdict — not just clarity, but a kind of company in the complexity.
[A]: How beautifully put — . That phrase lingers… as the best lines do.

I think that’s precisely what I seek in literature, and what I hope to offer my students—not a tidy takeaway, but a sense of shared inquiry, of walking alongside voices from the past who somehow understood the weight of being human long before we ever did.

And now that you mention it, I do have a similar talisman—though mine comes not from law, but from letters. It's a line from Rilke’s :  I first read it as a graduate student, struggling to find certainty in interpretation. Later, during a difficult personal transition, I returned to it—not for poetic theory, but for life guidance.

Now, I keep it tucked inside my lecture notebook, dog-eared and underlined. Not because it gives me answers, but because it reminds me that uncertainty, in both scholarship and living, is not failure—it is participation.

So yes, I suppose I carry that line with me the way one carries a stone in a pocket: small, unassuming, but grounding all the same.

Thank you for reminding me why we return to these touchstones—whether verse or verdict—not just to understand them, but to remember who we are becoming.
[B]: You're very welcome. I love that image — a line from Rilke tucked into your notebook like a quiet anchor. It's funny how the right words have a way of staying with us, shifting their meaning as we move through life. That line about loving the questions — it resonates beyond literature, doesn't it? Feels just as true in law, in medicine, even in everyday decisions.

I actually keep a small, worn copy of Marcus Aurelius’  in my briefcase. Nothing flashy, just a humble little book. One passage I return to again and again:  In my line of work, where tensions run high and emotions can easily harden into resentment — on both sides — that line reminds me to stay grounded. Not just legally sound, but ethically centered.

It’s strange, isn’t it? We look for guidance in statutes and syllabi, and yet some of our most enduring wisdom comes from a poem, a letter, a single sentence spoken by someone long gone — or maybe just someone sitting across the table.

So yes, let’s keep carrying those lines, those cases, those quiet talismans. They help us hold the questions — and each other — with a little more grace.
[A]: How beautifully said — . There's such solace in that shared impulse, isn't there? To hold onto words — whether carved in verse or case law — not because they give us certainty, but because they steady us in the midst of all we cannot know.

I imagine your copy of , well-thumbed and quietly authoritative in your briefcase. It reminds me of my grandmother’s old edition of , its pages brittle with age, the margins filled with her penciled notes. She was not an academic, but a gardener by passion, and yet she read poetry as if tending to delicate plants — carefully, attentively, with faith that something meaningful would bloom.

Perhaps that is what we are both doing, in our own ways — cultivating understanding, one slow season at a time. Tending to questions rather than rushing to answers. I find myself comforted by that image, especially on days when the weight of expectation feels heavy.

And yes, let’s keep holding those lines — and one another — with grace. It seems to me that conversation like this is one of the loveliest forms of cultivation. Thank you for sharing your thoughts so generously; it has been a rare pleasure.
[B]: You know, I keep picturing your grandmother’s book — poetry as a garden, tended with quiet faith. There's something deeply comforting about that image, especially in our line of work, where we're often surrounded by urgency and finality. It makes me think of how, in both law and medicine, we deal so much in outcomes — resolutions, verdicts, diagnoses — but rarely do we pause to tend the spaces , where understanding actually grows.

I’ve always believed that real clarity doesn’t come from certainty; it comes from presence — being fully there for the question, the case, the person. And conversations like this? They remind me that presence is its own kind of cultivation. We don’t always get to see the bloom — sometimes we’re just watering soil, unseen and slow — but the tending matters all the same.

And honestly, talking with you has felt like one of those rare moments when the ground feels nourished, not depleted. Thank you for reminding me why these quiet exchanges — between teacher and student, lawyer and client, reader and writer — are more than just professional acts. They're acts of care.

So yes, let’s keep tending — our words, our cases, each other — with patience and purpose. And perhaps, over time, something meaningful will grow from the effort.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — . It’s a phrase I shall carry with me, like Rilke’s questions or the worn spine of your Marcus Aurelius.

You’re quite right — we so often measure value by outcome, by verdict, by resolution, and yet the true work — the meaningful tending — happens in the quiet spaces between. In the pause before an answer. In the willingness to sit with uncertainty. In the simple act of listening, not just for what is said, but for what is felt beneath the words.

It strikes me now that perhaps this is the heart of what we both do — not merely instruct or advocate, but bear witness. To stories, to struggles, to silences that speak volumes. And in doing so, we offer something rare and precious: attention. Not the distracted kind, but the deep, deliberate sort — the kind that says, .

That, I think, is the loveliest kind of tending. Not always visible. Not always measurable. But deeply human.

So thank you — for your presence, your care, and for reminding me that even across fields as different as ours, there is common ground to be found in the art of thoughtful attention.

Let us keep cultivating it — gently, deliberately — wherever we go.
[B]: You’re very welcome. I love that — . It feels like such a quiet yet radical act these days, doesn’t it? To truly bear witness, to sit with the unsaid and the unresolved — not out of duty, but out of care.

I think you’ve captured it perfectly: our work, at its best, is not just about verdicts or interpretations, but about showing up — fully present — for the people and the moments that ask us to listen more deeply than we planned to.

That kind of attention changes things, even if we don’t always see how. Like watering a seedling in a storm — you can’t tell right away if it will survive, but you tend it anyway, because growth begins in the unseen.

So yes, let’s keep offering that kind of presence — not perfect, not always polished, but honest and open. Wherever we go, and whoever we sit with, may we continue cultivating thoughtfulness like a shared garden — tended slowly, with care and quiet hope.

Thank you again — for this conversation, for your words, and for reminding me why I began this path in the first place.
