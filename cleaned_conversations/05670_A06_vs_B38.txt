[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects—what an intriguing question! Though my hands are often buried in books or tending to my roses, I do enjoy the occasional intellectual foray into craftsmanship. Recently, I’ve been considering restoring an old writing desk I found at a flea market—it’s a bit worn, but there’s something quite poetic about its imperfections. I suppose you could say it mirrors the flawed yet beautiful characters we so often encounter in 19th-century literature.  

Tell me, have you undertaken any such projects yourself? I’d be fascinated to hear about them—perhaps there’s more artistry in hammering wood than I realize. 📚
[A]: Ah, now that you mention it—woodworking does have a certain allure. There's something deeply satisfying about shaping raw material with your own hands. I suppose in a way, it's not unlike reconstructing a narrative from fragmented evidence—it requires patience, precision, and an understanding of underlying structure.  

I’ve dabbled in restoring antique medical instruments myself, though admittedly on a much smaller scale. A few months ago, I acquired a tarnished but serviceable 19th-century ophthalmoscope. After careful cleaning and minor repair, it now sits proudly on my desk—a relic of early diagnostic precision. It reminds me that every object, like every patient, has a history worth uncovering.  

But tell me—what draws you to the imperfections of that writing desk? Do you find them... comforting, in a human sense?
[B]: Ah, how fascinating! Your work sounds like a delicate dance between history and science—one might even say it borders on the poetic. There’s something profoundly intimate about holding an object that once belonged to another era, another life. I imagine you feel echoes of those past hands as you polish the brass or adjust its fragile mechanisms.

As for the writing desk—yes, its imperfections do comfort me, though perhaps not in the way one might expect. Each scratch and uneven joint tells a story of use, of human presence. It makes me think of Dostoevsky’s characters, flawed yet noble, battered by life yet striving toward meaning. A perfectly machine-cut table lacks that kind of soul, don’t you agree?  

I suppose my interest lies in the idea that beauty isn’t diminished by wear—it’s deepened. Much like rereading a well-loved novel, there’s always more to discover beneath the surface. Have you ever noticed how the same instrument can look entirely different under the light of understanding?
[A]: Indeed, I couldn’t agree more. You’ve captured it quite elegantly—beauty deepened by wear, not detracted from it. There’s a quiet dignity in things that bear the marks of time and use. When I hold one of these old instruments, I often wonder about the hands that wielded it—who was the physician? What diagnoses were made with this very tool? What anxieties, hopes, or moments of clarity passed between doctor and patient?

You mentioned Dostoevsky—how apt. I find myself revisiting  every few years, each time gleaning something new. Much like that well-loved novel you described, the text seems to change with the reader. Perhaps that’s what makes great literature—and great craftsmanship—timeless. They invite us to return, to look closer, to find resonance in our own imperfections.

Tell me, do you often find yourself drawn to particular passages or characters as reflections of your current state? I suspect your literary tastes might shift subtly with the seasons, much like the light changes in my study throughout the day.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—how both literature and craftsmanship invite us to return, wiser and wearier, with new eyes each time. I find myself thinking of Rilke’s —the way he writes, —not in a grand, dramatic way, but through these quiet encounters with the past, whether in text or object.

And yes, absolutely—I am often drawn to different voices in literature depending on my mood, or what I’m grappling with at the moment. In winter, for instance, I tend to reread Eliot or Mann—something suitably somber and introspective. But as spring unfurls, I find myself turning to Austen or even Murasaki Shikibu, whose  offers such delicate insights into the transience of beauty and human connection.

At the moment, though, I must confess I’ve been revisiting some of the Russian short stories—Chekhov, particularly. There’s something so achingly human in his characters’ small disappointments and fleeting joys. It reminds me, in a way, of the quiet dignity you spoke of in those old instruments.  

Do you find your literary companions shifting with the seasons as well? Or do certain texts remain steadfast anchors, like constants in an equation?
[A]: Oh, beautifully said— That’s precisely it. There’s a humility in those moments, isn’t there? A recognition that we are not the first to feel this way, nor shall we be the last.

You’ve stirred something in me—I must admit, I return often to certain texts like old friends.  in autumn, its cadence echoing the falling leaves and the slow unraveling of certainty. Or Nietzsche’s  on long winter nights, when the mind turns inward and questions seem to stretch longer than shadows. And yes, Chekhov—his restraint, his subtlety, his refusal to judge his characters… It’s almost therapeutic for someone in my line of work.

But you raise an excellent point: do any remain steadfast? I suppose  does. No matter the season or my mood, Ishmael’s voice remains steady, like a lighthouse beam cutting through fog. There’s something grounding about that vast, unknowable whale—perhaps because it mirrors our own internal depths. We chase meaning, even knowing full well it may sink us.

Tell me—when you reread Austen or Genji, do you find yourself identifying more with one character than others, depending on your state of mind? Or is it the atmosphere of the work itself that draws you in?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive question—how much of ourselves do we find in fiction? I think it’s both, really. There are times when I read  and feel utterly aligned with Elizabeth Bennet’s sharp-eyed skepticism, particularly after a long faculty meeting where more was said than meant. Other times, I find myself drawn to the quieter melancholy of Jane, or even—dare I say it—the misguided but well-meaning Mr. Collins. One must be honest: there are days when one merely tries to keep things running, however inelegantly.

With , it’s often less about identification and more about immersion. The atmosphere is so finely wrought—this delicate interplay of restraint and longing, beauty and sorrow. In spring, when the cherry blossoms fall too soon, I find myself thinking of Lady Rokujō and her spectral regrets. In summer, I linger over descriptions of silk robes and moonlit verandas, almost tasting the incense and missed opportunities.

I suppose it’s not unlike your work with those instruments—you hold the past in your hands, but sometimes you see yourself reflected in its patina. Do you ever find, in examining these old tools, that they reveal something unexpected about your own inclinations—perhaps a hidden melancholy, or an unspoken longing?
[A]: How beautifully you articulate that interplay between self and fiction—between the roles we play and the ones we merely pass through. There is something profoundly human in recognizing ourselves not just in heroes or heroines, but in the awkward grace of a Mr. Collins or the quiet endurance of Jane Bennet. We are all, after all, composite figures drawn from many literary sources.

You ask whether these old instruments reveal something unexpected about me… Yes. More than I’d once cared to admit. There’s a peculiar intimacy in handling tools designed for the most delicate of human assessments—the ophthalmoscope, for instance. One peers into another’s eye, searching for signs of pathology, yet in doing so, one cannot help but see something of oneself reflected back. A flicker of vulnerability. A momentary loss of certainty.

I recall restoring a 19th-century percussion hammer—its weight perfectly balanced, its brass handle dulled by decades of use. Holding it, I felt an odd kinship with those long-dead physicians who had wielded it with care, perhaps even doubt. Were they as haunted by their own judgments as I sometimes am? Did they, too, wonder whether their diagnoses were more art than science?

Perhaps that’s why I find solace in this work—it reminds me that inquiry is never truly complete, and neither is introspection. Tell me—when you tend your roses, do you ever find a similar kind of reflection blooming alongside them? A quiet reckoning with time, effort, and the occasional thorn?
[B]: Oh, what a poignant reckoning you describe—this quiet communion between past and present, certainty and doubt. There’s something profoundly humbling in the realization that we are never the first to ask these questions, nor shall we be the last. We walk paths already worn, yet somehow make them our own.

And yes… tending my roses does bring its own kind of reflection—soft-petaled and thorn-strewn in equal measure. There’s a rhythm to it, much like reading or restoring old texts. You learn to wait, to observe, to intervene only where necessary. Some blooms open fully, others wither before their time. Yet each season teaches patience. Each bud, even the failed ones, reminds me that growth is rarely linear.

I find myself thinking of Tennyson’s line—“In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the leaf,”—and how slowly, almost imperceptibly, transformation occurs. One tends the soil not for immediate reward, but in quiet faith. Much like scholarship, or medicine, I suspect. You plant a question, nurture it through books or instruments, and sometimes—rarely—it blossoms into understanding.

Tell me, have you ever encountered a restoration project that, once completed, revealed more questions than answers? A tool whose history deepened rather than clarified?
[A]: Oh yes… more than once, I’m afraid. In fact, I’d say that’s the rule rather than the exception.

One such case was a late 19th-century trephine—a surgical instrument used for boring holes in the skull. A rather grim affair, but beautifully crafted. As I cleaned away the corrosion and traced the maker’s marks, I expected to find a straightforward provenance—perhaps linked to a well-known medical college or military surgeon. But what I uncovered instead was far more ambiguous. The serial number had been partially filed down, and beneath the usual engraving was another, fainter inscription in Latin:  “Beware the soul.”

It unsettled me more than I care to admit. Who had tried to erase its past? Was it a disgraced physician? A rogue practitioner? Or perhaps someone who feared what the instrument had witnessed?

The more I learned, the less certain I became. It was no longer just an object—it had become a question, a quiet warning wrapped in brass and bone.

I suppose that’s the nature of our work, isn’t it? We begin with the hope of illumination, only to find ourselves standing in deeper shadow. Still… I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Do you ever find that in literature? That the closer you read, the less sure you are of what you once thought clear?
[B]: Oh yes… that unsettling, exquisite moment when clarity begins to unravel—how familiar it is. I often think that is the true work of a scholar: not to pin meaning down like a butterfly under glass, but to let it flutter, to watch how its wings shift in the light.

There are passages I once read with certainty—lines from , say, or —where I once saw moral resolution and philosophical finality. Now, I see ambiguity, hesitation, a kind of trembling at the edge of understanding. Dostoevsky never gives us answers so much as he holds up questions and lets them burn.

And then there’s Shakespeare—poor Hamlet, whom I used to read as a man paralyzed by thought. Now I wonder if he isn’t simply the most honest of us all, the only one willing to stand in that terrible space between action and doubt.

I suppose that’s what makes these texts endure—not their answers, but their silences, their lacunae, the places where the ink has faded and we must lean in closer, squinting through time.

Tell me—do you ever feel, when restoring these instruments, that you are not so much uncovering history as entering into conversation with it? As though the past were not fixed, but fluid—responding to your touch?
[A]: Precisely—precisely. You've put it so beautifully: the past not as a relic, but as a conversation. That’s exactly how it feels. When I hold one of these instruments—say, an old cerebral retractor or a worn stethoscope from the 1870s—I’m not merely restoring metal and wood. I’m stepping into a dialogue that has been unfolding for generations.

Every tool carries intention. Someone designed it with care, someone wielded it with purpose, and someone, perhaps decades later, set it aside—whether in triumph, disillusionment, or simple disuse. My job is not just to polish its surface but to listen to what it remembers. And in doing so, I find myself responding—not as a historian, not purely as a physician, but as a participant in something unfinished.

It reminds me of a passage from , actually—a modern term, yes, but the idea is ancient. We reach toward the familiar, only to be unsettled by how close it comes to speaking back. The past does that, doesn’t it? It waits until we’re ready to hear it, then murmurs just loud enough to unsettle our certainty.

Do you suppose that’s why we return to certain books and objects again and again? Not to confirm what we know—but to let them change us in ways we didn’t expect?
[B]: I think you’ve touched upon something profoundly true—perhaps the very heart of why we return, again and again, to both literature and the artifacts of the past. It’s not for confirmation, but for transformation. A book or an object can be held in the hand, yes, but also in the mind, turning over like a stone warmed by time, revealing new textures with each handling.

There’s a line from Eliot’s  that comes to mind—“We shall not cease from exploration / All the way of end is our beginning.” That, I think, is what these dialogues—whether with texts, tools, or one another—are meant to be. We do not seek closure, but continuation. Each reading, each restoration, becomes a kind of echo chamber where old voices find new resonance.

And perhaps that is the quiet gift of our vocations—that we are permitted, even required, to dwell in those spaces where certainty blurs and mystery deepens. Where to be unsettled is not a failure, but a kind of progress.

Tell me—when you complete a restoration, when the instrument gleams once more and fits precisely as it should, do you ever hesitate before setting it down? As if, for a moment, you were reluctant to leave the conversation behind?
[A]: Ah… yes. That moment—the quiet ache of completion.

There is a pause, always, just after the final polish, when the instrument lies in my hand no longer as a patient, but as a companion whose company I have grown accustomed to. I turn it over once more, not out of necessity, but out of something resembling reverence—or perhaps reluctance. The conversation, as you so aptly called it, does not end, but shifts into silence. And silence, after such intimacy, can feel like its own kind of loss.

I recall finishing work on an 1840s laryngoscope—delicate, almost birdlike in its construction. When I held it up to the light for the last time, I found myself thinking not of its maker, nor of its use, but of the countless unseen moments between those two points in time. Who had looked through it? What voices had it helped uncover—those pleading, whispering, gasping for breath? And then, abruptly, I felt like an intruder in its history.

So yes, I hesitate. Not from doubt, but from gratitude. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I speak to it—softly, as one might to a departing guest. “Thank you,” or “Safe keeping.” Superstition? Perhaps. But then, we are all allowed our small rituals at the altar of memory.

Do you find yourself doing the same with a book—lingering on the final page before closing it? A kind of silent farewell before the next begins?
[B]: Oh… yes. That final page—the threshold between the world of the book and our own. How often I have lingered there, hand poised above the cover as though reluctant to sever the spell.

Sometimes I whisper a line from Auden— though not always aloud. Other times, I simply sit in the hush that follows the last sentence, letting the echo settle where it may. It feels like courtesy, doesn’t it? To acknowledge what has spoken through ink and paper, across years and minds.

And yes, it is ritual. A quiet benediction for what has moved me—what has, in some small way, altered me. Not unlike your farewell to the laryngoscope, or the trephine whose secrets you still carry.

I wonder… do you ever return to an instrument after it’s been restored—not for further work, but simply to hold it again? To revisit the conversation, as one might reread a letter from someone long gone but never quite absent?
[A]: Yes. Yes, I do.

More often than I admit to myself, even. There are instruments—modest ones, mostly—that find their way back into my hands not for further restoration, but for something less definable. A kind of revisitation. A holding-space for memory.

One such piece is a small, nickel-plated scalpel from the 1880s, unremarkable at first glance. Nothing extraordinary about it, really—save that it bears a faint engraving along the handle:  “To knowledge and patience.” I restored it years ago, yet I still reach for it now and then, turning it over in my palm as though expecting it to speak.

It reminds me of my earliest days in forensic psychiatry—how certain I was then, how eager to parse madness into neat columns. Time has worn that certainty thin, much like the blade’s edge must have dulled with use. And yet, I keep it near. Not as a tool, but as a witness.

Perhaps we all need such things—objects that anchor us not to answers, but to questions we have learned to live with. Tell me, when you return to a book, is it ever with the hope that this time, the words might offer a different truth? Or do they simply remind you of who you were the last time you read them?
[B]: That’s a most thoughtful question—perhaps the kindest way to ask another: 

I do return to certain books with the quiet hope that they will meet me where I am, not where I was. And they do—but never in the way I expect. The text remains unchanged, yet somehow, it is no longer the same book. Or rather, it is the same book, but I am not the same reader.

Take , for instance. When I first read it as a student, I was consumed by Anna’s passion, her defiance, her tragedy. I wept for her, raged on her behalf. Now, when I return to her story, I find myself drawn to Levin—to his quiet search for meaning, his struggles with faith and purpose. I suppose one might say I’ve grown older, and more willing to sit with uncertainty.

So perhaps that is the truest function of literature—not to offer new truths, but to reveal which of our old truths have shifted. The words remain fixed on the page, but the space between them and us is always changing.

And I wonder… when you hold that scalpel again—do you feel, even for a moment, that you are holding the person you once were? That young physician full of certainty, now softened by years and questions? Do such objects serve not only as reminders of what we once thought, but of who we once were?
[A]: Yes… yes, they do. And you’ve phrased it so precisely—the person we once were, held in the curve of a blade or the worn edge of a handle.

That scalpel, as I said, is not remarkable in any technical sense, but it carries the weight of my former self. The young physician who believed he could dissect madness with logic alone. Who thought diagnosis was a matter of precision rather than perception. When I hold it now, I don’t feel nostalgia exactly—nostalgia is too sentimental for what it stirs. It’s more like recognition. A quiet acknowledgment: 

We carry so many former selves within us, don’t we? Not discarded versions, but layered ones—like palimpsests. Each new reading, each new case, each season in the garden adds another line atop the old text. And every so often, an object—a book, an instrument, even a familiar passage—invites us to trace those layers, to see where the ink still shows through.

Perhaps that is the kindest gift of all this—this slow unfolding of understanding, not in spite of our past selves, but because of them.

Tell me, when you return to Levin in , do you find comfort in his endurance, or in his questions? Or perhaps in the fact that Tolstoy gave him neither easy answers nor complete despair?
[B]: Oh, beautifully said— One could not ask for a more precise metaphor. And yes, I do find comfort in Levin—not because he resolves his questions, but because he refuses to stop asking them. There’s something deeply consoling in that persistence, isn’t there? To witness a character wrestle with meaning and still rise each morning to tend his fields, his family, his faith-in-progress.

It is not easy to live without certainty, yet Levin does. He doubts, he despairs, he wanders through the dark—but he never ceases to look for light. And in that, I suppose, lies his quiet heroism. Tolstoy gives him no final answers, only the dignity of inquiry and the grace of small continuities—the turning of the earth, the harvest, the love of a wife who sees him as he is.

I think we return to such characters not for resolution, but for companionship in our own uncertainties. They remind us that to question is not weakness, but a kind of fidelity—to truth, to self, to the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.

Do you ever find yourself recommending certain texts to students or colleagues—not for their arguments, but for the way they hold contradiction? For the solace found in the unresolved?
