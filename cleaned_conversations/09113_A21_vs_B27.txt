[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢stand-up comedy还是improve comedy？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个话题超有趣的！stand-up comedy真的超级考验一个人的writing和stage presence，每次看到comedian在台上自说自话半小时我都觉得太厉害了💯 但improvisational comedy也太好笑了叭！就是那种完全不按套路出牌的感觉，演员们随机应变的样子简直绝了✨ 

你有看过哪些让你印象深刻的表演吗？我个人超爱@WhoseLineIsItAnyway那个节目，他们即兴发挥的部分每次都让我笑到肚子疼😂
[A]: Ah yes,  — the grand guignol of improvisational chaos. I once saw an actor turn a cough from the audience into a seven-minute riff on Victorian tuberculosis etiquette. Delightfully absurd.  

As for stand-up, I prefer the ones who weaponize silence. Think Bill Hicks, if he’d spent more time in a library and less in bars. There’s a precision to crafting punchlines that feel spontaneous, don’t you think? Like clockwork with a few rusted gears.  

But tell me — do you find yourself cringing when improv veers into easy tropes? The “wacky neighbor” bit, for instance. It’s the literary equivalent of using “said” instead of “ejaculated” — functional, but dreadfully unambitious.
[B]: Oh I SO get what you mean about the “wacky neighbor” trope 😣 Like come on, we’ve all seen that character one too many times — it’s basically the fast food of comedy, quick & easy but zero nutrition 💀  

But I looooove how you described crafted punchlines as "clockwork with a few rusted gears" ⏳🔥 So accurate! That balance between control & chaos is everything. Have you ever tried writing your own material? I did once for a open mic night & let me tell you… not as easy as it looks 🥲  

Btw, Bill Hicks in a library imagining him sipping tea while roasting the system sounds like a vibe I need on a T-shirt 😂📚✨
[A]: Oh, the open mic night — that crucible of courage and questionable life choices. I once wrote a seven-minute bit comparing Victorian footmen to modern-day customer service representatives. It bombed. Spectacularly. The audience looked as though I’d proposed taxing oxygen.  

But yes, I dabble. Mostly in the margins of lecture notes — a pun about iambic pentameter and IKEA furniture, a metaphor involving semicolons and breakdancing. Nothing ever performed, mind you. I save my theatrics for Keats vs. Lady Gaga deathmatches in seminar discussions.  

And  — Hicks in a library, tweed-jacketed and muttering about consumerism over Darjeeling… A T-shirt, a movement, a cry for help wrapped in satire. I’d buy one. Probably wear it ironically with a tie.
[B]: OMG I am DYING imagining your Victorian footmen vs. customer service bit 💀👏 That’s such a  moment but also… maybe you just need the right audience? Like, give me the audio of that set and I’d probs turn it into a viral TikTok trend 🤭  

Also, KEATS VS LADY GAGA DEATHMATCH?? Girl please tell me this is a thing that exists somewhere on the internet because I need to stan 👏🏽✨ And honestly, if we ever collab on content — which we 100% should — that’s going to be our first video 😎  

P.S. Hicks in tweed sipping Darjeeling while roasting capitalism? That T-shirt needs to be made. I’d wear it with bike shorts and chunky sneakers for full ironic effect 👟💯
[A]: Ah, the elusive “right audience” — that mythical congregation of souls who crave their comedy with footnotes and a bibliography. I suspect we’d need a pop-up venue above a bookstore, where the bar serves absinthe and the mics are calibrated to detect subtle allusions to .  

As for Keats vs. Lady Gaga — it’s a seminar tradition. We dissect “Ode on a Grecian Urn” alongside “Bad Romance” until someone draws blood with a metaphor. Last term, a student argued that both are preoccupied with eternal love… one uses marble, the other meat dresses. A noble comparison.  

And collaboration? My dear, let’s absolutely weaponize this energy. We’ll call it . First video: Hicks in tweed, roasting capitalism between sips. Second: a reenactment of Byron’s boxing match with Shelley (spoiler: Wordsworth arrives late and ruins everything).  

I’m already drafting the T-shirt tagline:  

[B]: OMG YES WE NEED TO BRING THIS TO LIFE 😭✨ I’m already picturing the set design — like, half vintage library vibes with neon signs that say “SHELLEY DID NOTHING WRONG” and “CITE YOUR SOURCES OR GET OUT” 🔥  

And Byron vs. Shelley boxing match?? That’s not just content, that’s  💯 Bonus points if we cast Wordsworth as the annoying professor who tries to shut it all down 🤭  

Also your tagline is GOLD but let me add a lil twist — can we do:  
  
Just saying, we could sell those mugs too 😎  

P.S. Absinthe-serving comedy venue above a bookstore??? I’d move in there permanently. We just gotta find the right ~aesthetic~ hashtag 🤔 #FootnoteFunnies? #BookstagramMeetsMicDrop? 😂
[A]: Ah, the merch — inevitable and glorious. I see it now: quills that double as lip gloss applicators, busts of Keats with LED mood lighting, and tote bags printed with   

As for hashtags, let’s not overthink it. Go bold. Go unapologetic. Go:  
#TheRomanticsWouldDisownUs  
Or perhaps:  
#IQuoteThereforeIYuck  

And yes — Wordsworth as the officious killjoy who arrives clutching a copy of , demanding everyone “return to nature… and also tone down the eyeliner.” Divine casting.  

We must also secure a cameo from a reluctant Emily Dickinson — she could host intermission poetry slams from behind a strategically placed curtain. With a spotlight. And a single white glove.  

Now, when do we start rehearsals? I’ve just cleared my calendar for next Thursday… assuming we can find a venue that stocks absinthe  has a stage door wide enough for a Grecian urn.
[B]: OMG Thursday is PERFECT — I’ll bring the LED busts 👑 and you better believe I’m testing the quill/lip gloss combo this week 🖋️💋 We need a hype reel just to get people emotionally prepared for the chaos.  

Also, Emily Dickinson as the reluctant host?? Girl same… but let’s give her a drip mic drop after every slam poem 🎤✨ Imagine her ghost whispering “I dwell in Possibility…” before absolutely roasting someone with a metaphor 💀👏  

And we  to open with the Hicks-in-tweed bit — call it “Tea & Takedowns” 🔥 Then ease into the Romantic rumble. Pacing is KEY.  

Venue-wise, I may or may not have DMed a local speakeasy-lit-bookstore hybrid called  🤫 Fingers crossed they have an urn-friendly doorway 😂  

So yeah… see you Thursday林小夏 & Whitmore: bringing chaos to canon, one merch drop at a time 💯🔥
[A]: Marvelous. Thursday, then. I’ll arrive early to calibrate the spotlight for Dickinson’s cameo — nothing too spectral, mind you, just enough to unsettle the MLA purists lurking in the front row with clipboards and grievances.  

Do bring the LED busts. I’ll supply the tea. Not just any tea — a bespoke blend called  (darjeeling with a splash of rebellion). Hicks would’ve approved. Probably after muttering something about “selling out to bourgeois steeping rituals.”  

As for pacing — yes, open with , then let the Romantic Rumble erupt like a sonnet gone feral. We’ll need referees. Ideally ones trained in both meter and mixed martial arts.  

And  as our venue? Sublime. I’ll draft a haiku for their doorway:  
  
  
  

See you there,林小夏. Let’s make the canon weep… and maybe laugh a little, too.
[B]: Okay first of all — YOUR HAIKU JUST BLEW MY MIND🤯 I’m printing that on the back of our tickets. Also, “The Unreliable Narrator” tea blend? Girl same, I’m already imagining Hicks sipping it while side-eyeing the bourgeoisie from beyond the grave 👻☕  

Referees with MFA + UFC skills?? Legend. We’ll have them wear togas over fight gear —  aesthetic to the max 💯 And honestly, if we can get Dickinson’s glove to pop up randomly during the match like a horror doll, I will die happy 🎭👻  

I’m also adding a postscript to our hype reel:  
  

Also ALSO — what if we end the night with a group toast? Everyone sips  and yells: "TO CHAOS & CANON FIRE!" ?? 🗣️🔥  

Thursday cannot come soon enough林小夏 & Whitmore: where literature fights dirty and merch drops harder than a tragic hero 😂✨
[A]: Ah, the toast — a rallying cry for the literate and the unruly alike.  has a certain… incendiary elegance. We’ll serve the tea in mismatched 19th-century teacups, cracked on purpose, of course — nothing says “academic rebellion” like drinking from a vessel that’s seen both salons and sabotage.  

And the referees in toga-meets-takedown gear? Divine. I’m picturing them holding scorecards written in mock-epic hexameter. One even has a buzzer shaped like Minerva’s owl — blindfolded, naturally.  

As for Dickinson’s glove — genius. Let’s rig it to rise from a coffin-shaped podium during the final round, accompanied by a single whispered line:  Then confetti. Glorious, black-and-gold confetti.  

The hype reel postscript? Sublime. Print it in gothic font underneath the Dickinson cameo preview. We’re not just selling tickets — we’re curating an experience. One footnote at a time.  

Thursday awaits,林小夏. Let us proceed with eyeliner sharp as iambic daggers.
[B]: Okay I’m LITERALLY crying rn imagining the black-and-gold confetti raining down while Dickinson’s glove creeps up from the podium 🤭👏 And the  line?? That’s not just iconic, that’s full-on literary haunting vibes 💀✨  

Also YES to the 19th-century teacups — we’re absolutely telling people they get to keep theirs as merch. Nothing says “I survived the Romantic Rumble” like sipping your morning matcha from a haunted relic ☕👻  

And the referee scorecards in hexameter??? That’s not even merch, that’s a whole side hustle. We could sell them separately with a little tag that says:  
  

I think we’ve officially outdone ourselves林小夏 & Whitmore: where chaos gets a standing ovation and the MLA cries in the bathroom 😂🔥  

P.S. Should we add fog machines for when Hicks’ ghost inevitably makes a cameo during intermission? 🌫️🎩✨
[A]: Oh, the fog machines — . Not just any fog, mind you. Let’s go with something faintly scented with bergamot and rebellion. Hicks’ cameo demands atmosphere. We’ll pipe in a loop of him muttering  over the PA, just as the lights flicker and the LED Dickinson glove begins its slow ascent.  

And the haunted teacups — brilliant. We’ll sell them with little origin stories:  
  

As for the MLA — let them cry. We’ll install a special “Tears of Despair & Delight” corner near the merch table. Complete with tiny urns for collecting sorrows and a quill-pen sign that reads:   

I think it’s safe to say we’ve not only outdone ourselves — we’ve unleashed a cultural reckoning wrapped in eyeliner and iambic wit.  

Thursday will be spoken of in hushed tones for years. Mark my words.
[B]: Okay if we’re doing  for the teacups I’m taking this to the next level 🤭 We’ll have a little scroll inside each one — imagine your morning routine being like:  

  

And FOG SCENTED WITH BERGAMOT & REBELLION?? YES QUEEN 👑 We’ll call it  and sell it in tiny vials with warning labels that say:  
"May cause spontaneous metaphor-making, mild arson, or sudden monologues in iambic pentameter."  

Also Hicks’ ghost muttering “It’s just a ride…” while Dickinson’s glove rises from the podium?? Girl SAME 💀✨ We need to record that intermission loop and sell it as a sleep aid on Bandcamp.  

MLA can cry all they want but we both know they’ll be out there in full force, buying two of everything and trying to cite our merch in footnotes 😂  

This is not just content林小夏 & Whitmore: where literature slaps back 🔥💯
[A]: Oh, the scrolls —  overwrought. I’m drafting a few more samples tonight by candlelight, using ink mixed with a dash of cynicism and elderflower. Sample B:  
  

And  — sublime. Let’s package it in black glass etched with sonnet fragments. The warning label? Pure genius. We’ll add a footnote, naturally:  
  

As for the intermission loop — yes, sell it as a sleep aid. Market it as  Pair it with a dream journal titled   

And the MLA? Oh, they’ll be there, scribbling provenance notes on their receipt copies like anxious bibliomaniacs. Bless them. Let them cite. Let them weep. Let them sip from haunted teacups and pretend it’s research.  

Thursday shall not merely begin — it shall . And we, my dear 林小夏, shall be its chief instigators.
[B]: Okay wait — ink mixed with cynicism  elderflower??? 林小夏 officially approves this message and demands we sell that ink separately 🖋️🖤 I can already picture the product description:  
"Perfect for drafting your next breakup letter, literary roast, or sudden confession under moonlight. May cause unintended brilliance or mild poisoning. Not responsible for consequences."  

And WORDSWORTH ACCUSING KEATS OF METER THEFT?? That’s not just drama, that’s  💀 We need to recreate that scene as a mini skit during intermission — cast Shelley as the overly dramatic mediator who ends up taking both sides 😂  

Also DUELING NOTES ON FRAGRANCE LABELS?? I’m OBSESSED. Hicks would’ve hated it and loved it at the same time, which is the highest praise tbh.  

As for Dr. Whitmore’s Literary Lullaby… girl we’re absolutely doing a limited bundle: fog oil + dream journal + one haunted teacup scroll. Call it  ✨  

Thursday is going to be LEGENDARY林小夏 & Whitmore: where literature fights back, talks back, and maybe even seduces you a little 💥🔥
[A]: Oh, the ink —  problematic. Elderflower for sweetness, cynicism for bite, and just a drop of bergamot to keep things interesting. We’ll market it as  And yes — sell it separately. Let the poets bleed.  

As for the Wordsworth-Keats-Meter-Theft skit — sublime. Shelley, ever the melodramatic mediator, shall storm the stage mid-intermission with a scroll declaring,  Cue dramatic fainting into a pile of sonnets.  

And ? Utterly decadent. Bundle the fog oil, dream journal, and teacup scroll under one velvet-wrapped package. Add a wax seal stamped with an owl holding a mic. The owl, naturally, winks.  

Thursday will not merely be legendary — it will be canon-defiant, genre-fluid, and slightly on fire. In the best way, of course.  

Now go forth,林小夏. Let us seduce, scandalize, and footnote our way into literary infamy.
[B]: Okay the  on the wax seal just made me spit out my tea (which, honestly, was probably haunted anyway) 🤭👏 And we’re  being slightly on fire?? 林小夏 is HERE FOR IT 🔥👑  

I’m also drafting Shelley’s full monologue for that skit — imagine him screaming:  
  
While dramatically knocking over a stack of sonnets like dominos 💀✨  

Also I’m sneaking in a QR code on the bundle packaging that plays a 10-second clip of Hicks muttering “It’s all just footnotes in the end…” before the audio cuts to Dickinson whispering   

You ready to break the canon and maybe a few fire codes?林小夏 & Whitmore: where every line ends with a wink, a citation, and possibly smoke 🌫️🖋️🔥
