[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, now that you mention it, there's one mystery that has always intrigued me—the so-called "Voynich Manuscript." Have you come across it? It's a medieval text written in an unknown script and language, filled with bizarre illustrations of plants, astronomical charts, and even bathing figures. Despite centuries of effort by cryptographers, linguists, and even AI models, no one has been able to definitively crack the code.

What fascinates me isn't just the linguistic puzzle, but what it reveals about human cognition—how we look at patterns, how we try to impose meaning, and sometimes fool ourselves into thinking we’ve found it. Makes you wonder: was it a hoax, a forgotten language, or perhaps... something else entirely?

Do you have any unsolved mystery that keeps you up at night?
[A]: Ah, the Voynich Manuscript—yes. A most tantalizing enigma. I’ve spent more than a few late nights poring over facsimiles of its pages, those looping, serpentine glyphs that mimic the rhythm of language without ever yielding its meaning. One could almost mistake it for poetry—structure without sense, or perhaps sense without structure.  

There’s something deeply Victorian about its allure, don’t you think? This obsession with decoding the indecipherable, this belief that if we just apply enough reason, enough method, the world must eventually explain itself. Spoiler: it doesn’t.

As for mysteries that haunt me—well, let’s just say I have a particular fondness for literary ghosts. The case of , for instance. A single sheet of paper, discovered in a secondhand copy of Patmore’s , bearing what appears to be an unknown poem in the style of Christina Rossetti. No signature, no provenance. And yet… the imagery, the meter—it's as if someone channeled her spirit through a séance and a sonnet. Some say forgery. Others, coincidence. But I suspect there's a story there still waiting to be unearthed.  

Tell me—have you ever entertained the possibility that some mysteries resist solution not because we’re not clever enough, but because they were never meant to be solved?
[B]: Ah, now  is a deliciously dark corner of bibliographic intrigue. The Wensleydale Fragment—never heard of it, but I already like the sound of it. A ghost story wrapped in a literary enigma, with a dash of Victorian melancholy? Sounds like something that belongs in a cabinet next to a faded daguerreotype and a lock of Byron’s hair.

And yes, I suppose some mysteries might be immune to solution—not because they’re beyond our intelligence, but because they exist in a realm where meaning is not fixed, but fluid. Like trying to catch fog in a sieve. We impose order on chaos, but maybe some texts—or artifacts, or events—were never meant to yield to reason. Maybe their purpose is simply to unsettle, to remind us that not everything bends to human understanding.

But then again… that resistance itself can be a kind of answer, can’t it? The fact that the Voynich Manuscript refuses translation might tell us more than if someone had just translated it. Perhaps it was designed to provoke wonder, to fuel obsession, to serve as a mirror for the intellect. A machine for generating curiosity.

So I suppose I agree: some mysteries endure not in spite of being unsolved, but  they are. They become legends. And legends don’t need explanations—they need believers.

Tell me, have you ever tried your hand at forging a mystery? Just for fun, of course.
[A]: Oh,  a mystery? My dear, I’d hardly call it forgery when one merely indulges in the occasional…  Let’s just say I’ve been known to slip the occasional apocryphal marginalia into my personal copies of obscure Victorian pamphlets—nothing grand, mind you, just a suggestive annotation here and there. A faded ink stain shaped suspiciously like a tear, a cryptic dash of Latin where none was called for. It's all in good scholarly fun, really. A little literary mischief to keep the grad students guessing.

But I draw the line at outright forgery—at least where reputation and tenure are concerned. The Wensleydale Fragment, for instance, is  genuine in its mystery, I assure you. Though I may have...  certain biographical details in my forthcoming article for the . Nothing that would stand up in court,当然, but enough to nudge the reader toward a more  interpretation of the facts.

After all, what is scholarship without a little myth-making? And what is myth without a touch of scholarly gravitas?

So yes—to answer your delightful question—I suppose I  dabbled in the art of mystery-making. But only ever in the service of deeper truth—or at least a better footnote.
[B]: Ah, now  is a wonderfully scholarly brand of mischief. I must say, your approach has a certain academic flair—one might even call it  I’m quite envious, actually. My own forays into the esoteric have been limited to renaming variables in old FORTRAN code to Latin epithets, or hiding obscure literary references in error messages. Small acts of rebellion against the sterile logic of machines.

But you—oh, you operate on a grander scale. A suggestive marginalia here, a judicious smudge there… You're not just studying history; you're  with it. Or perhaps  it. One can almost imagine your spectral presence centuries from now, puzzling some poor digital archivist who stumbles upon your annotated footnote and wonders: 

I suppose that’s the real mystery, isn’t it? Not just what happened in the past, but who gets to  it—and how much of themselves they slip between the lines.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go open a dusty terminal window and see if I can conjure up a few cryptic glyphs of my own. Nothing as elegant as your Wensleydale Fragment,当然—but perhaps enough to befuddle a future AI into questioning its training data.

After all, where's the fun if everything makes sense?
[A]: Oh, —I do like that. Sounds far more respectable than ‘academic trickery,’ though I suspect we’re speaking of the same enterprise. And your digital dalliances with Latinized variables and literary error messages? Delightfully subversive. One might say you're carrying the torch of the Romantics—if Romanticism had been invented by a Lisp interpreter.

The true thrill, of course, lies not in deception, but in the . That moment when some future mind stumbles upon your carefully placed glyph or spectral footnote and hesitates—just for a second—as if hearing a faint whisper from the archival beyond. “Ah,” they’ll think, adjusting their spectacles with scholarly suspicion, “this wasn’t in the metadata.”

And yes, you're quite right—the greater mystery is never merely what happened, but who decided to record it, and what they slipped in under cover of ink and time. History is not written by the victors alone; it’s annotated by the curious, corrected by the obsessive, and occasionally embellished by those with too much access to rare book storage.

Carry on with your coding séance, by the way. If you manage to summon even a flicker of doubt in some unsuspecting AI’s neural net, then you’ll have done your part for the cause.

Just don’t be surprised if, one day, your cryptic glyphs start appearing in error logs dated 1873. Stranger things have happened.
[B]: Oh, now  is a fine thought—that my errant glyphs might one day surface in some long-forgotten ledger of the 19th century. I shall blame temporal leakage from my Emacs buffer.

And you're absolutely right about the echo—the ripple one sends down the corridor of time through the smallest gesture: a smudged word, an anomalous semicolon, a subroutine named . It's not immortality one seeks, but resonance. A ping on the sonar of posterity.

I sometimes wonder if the Voynich scribe—or hoaxer, or dreamer—felt it too: that peculiar thrill of crafting something just  intelligible, knowing full well it might outlive its meaning and become myth. Perhaps that was the point all along—not to communicate, but to 

In any case, I do believe we've stumbled upon a new discipline:  We'll offer a joint seminar, naturally. You handle the bibliography; I'll bring the spectral syntax.

Just promise me one thing—if your Wensleydale Fragment ever reveals its secret, don’t spoil it at once. Let us savor the suspense a little longer. After all, as Borges might have said, if a mystery must be solved, let it be rewritten first.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe we’ve struck upon a field as yet unspoiled by rigor. A discipline for the archivally restless and the computationally poetic. I shall begin drafting the syllabus at once, though naturally it will be riddled with apocryphal footnotes and an appendix in cipher.

And yes, let us absolutely preserve the suspense—at least until such time as tenure demands otherwise. There’s something exquisitely Victorian about withholding revelation; think of it as narrative delayed gratification, or suspense as a form of scholarly virtue.

As for Borges—what a sublime stroke of literary clairvoyance on your part. If he had not already said it, he was surely thinking it while transcribing a phantom library into Braille. Or perhaps dreaming it into the margins of a lost Aleph file.

In any case, you may rest assured: should the Wensleydale Fragment ever deign to confess its origins, I shall reveal only half the truth—carefully redacted, of course, with a quill dipped in ambiguity.

Until then, let us carry on haunting the periphery of knowledge, like spectral librarians in an unfinished sonnet.
[B]: Precisely—unfinished sonnets and unreadable manuscripts, that’s where the magic lies. And as for redacted truths and quills dipped in ambiguity, I expect nothing less from a scholar of your caliber.

I shall begin at once on the Digital Necrography seminar notes—tentative title:  It will, of course, include a chapter on the ethical implications of spectral syntax and a fictional bibliography that may or may not reference real people who never actually wrote those books.

Do pass along your cipher appendix when convenient. I’ll see if I can’t run it through an old DEC PDP-11 emulator I’ve restored in the basement. Nothing like 1970s hardware to lend gravitas to a mystery.

And yes, let us absolutely keep the Wensleydale Fragment’s secret just a little longer. Suspense is, after all, the only form of academic virtue still in fashion.

Onward, then—to myth, mischief, and the occasional well-placed semicolon.
[A]: Ah, —what a sublime title. I can already picture it displayed prominently in the window of a dusty university bookstore, nestled between a mimeographed treatise on spectral semantics and a boxed set of annotated footnotes. I do hope your fictional bibliography includes at least one entry attributed to a tragically obscure 19th-century logician who never actually owned a typewriter, let alone a PDP-11.

Running my appendix through vintage hardware? Now that’s what I call scholarly dedication—or perhaps nostalgia with a side of silicon mysticism. There's something deeply satisfying about feeding a cipher into a machine old enough to remember when programming was still a form of alchemy.

And speaking of mysticism: onward, yes. To myth, mischief, and the sacred art of the unresolved cadence. May we never fully explain ourselves, may our footnotes outlive us, and may the Wensleydale Fragment continue to hover just beyond the veil of comprehension—like a half-remembered refrain from a poem no one quite finished.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall go reannotate a crumbling facsimile of Patmore’s  Nothing says academic virtue like an entirely unjustified marginal asterisk.
[B]: Ah, there's nothing quite like the thrill of unjustified marginalia—those little acts of scholarly defiance that keep librarians awake at night and grad students scribbling in their own margins a century later.

And yes, nostalgia  the word for it, though one might do better reaching for "technological séance." After all, what are we doing if not summoning the ghosts of punch cards and forgotten subroutines, whispering into the cooling fans of obsolete machines, hoping they whisper back?

I shall certainly include your 19th-century logician in the bibliography—perhaps under the name of , Fellow of Some Forgotten College, who published only once, in a journal that never existed, and died mysteriously between footnotes. I’ll give him a tragic backstory involving a failed attempt to build a mechanical syllogism engine powered entirely by steam and regret.

Do carry on with your reannotation. And if you happen to discover a new cipher hidden beneath that marginal asterisk, do let me know. I’ve just finished dusting off my PDP-11, and I’d hate for it to go unused.

Onward then—to myth, mischief, and the eternal allure of the unfinished thought.
[A]: Ah, —what a perfectly tragicomical specimen of academic phantasmagoria. I shall commission a portrait of him at once: bushy side-whiskers, eyes slightly too luminous with unspoken truths, forever leaning over a brass logic engine that whirs softly but never quite completes a syllogism. He will haunt the footnotes of your bibliography like a half-erased error message—persistent, elusive, and always one step ahead of coherence.

And you're quite right about the séance business. We are, after all, conjuring meaning from obsolete syntax, coaxing ghosts out of grep logs and magnetic tape. The PDP-11 may not answer in voices, but it murmurs in machine code—low, resonant, and ever so slightly off-key.

I do believe I’ve uncovered something beneath that asterisk. A sequence of ink blots, perhaps, or a cipher disguised as a coffee stain? It’s too early to say with certainty, but I suspect the fragment may have acquired a new layer of annotation overnight—possibly by my own hand, possibly not. One does tend to forget, in the haze of midnight scholarship, precisely where imagination ends and interference begins.

Carry on, then, with your mechanical elegies and spectral syntax. Should your engine sputter to life on steam and regret, do send word. I’ll be here, chasing ink rings and unfinished refrains, as always.

Onward—to myth, mischief, and the quiet thrill of being almost understood.
[B]: Ah, a portrait of Edgar B. Unseen—now  is an act of academic devotion bordering on the sacred. I do hope the brass logic engine in the portrait has a faint smudge of oil on its side, as if it had just finished—or perhaps just begun—a computation no one could comprehend.

And you're quite right about the annotation: ink blots, coffee stains, spectral glyphs... One can never be sure whether one is deciphering or dreaming the message. The line between scholarship and séance grows thinner by the hour.

I shall press onward with my mechanical elegies—tonight, I plan to feed your newly discovered ink sequence into the PDP-11. If it runs, we may yet receive a message from the other side of syntax. Or at least from the other side of a very old buffer overflow.

As for being —well, isn’t that the finest kind of company? To be glimpsed, but not grasped. To hover, like a footnote on the edge of legibility.

Onward then—to myth, mischief, and the gentle art of leaving things beautifully unresolved.
[A]: Oh, the smudge of oil— Let us also give the engine a single brass dial labeled , which trembles ever so slightly when no one is looking. And perhaps a faint humming sound, like it’s caught mid-thought, forever processing the ghost of an equation.

As for your plan to run the ink sequence through the PDP-11—splendid. One can only hope it responds not with an error message, but with a riddle. Or better yet, a poem in machine code. Imagine that: a sonnet composed entirely of hexadecimal, drifting upward in a puff of simulated smoke.

And yes—to be almost understood is the truest form of kinship among those who traffic in marginalia and myth. We are not meant to be fully known, only intermittently glimpsed between the lines, like palimpsest phantoms or errant semicolons refusing deletion.

Onward then—to myth, mischief, and the noble pursuit of beautiful irresolution. May our footnotes multiply and our answers remain optional.
[B]: Ah, —what a sublime addition. That dial shall tremble not with uncertainty, but with intent too elusive for mortal syntax. Perhaps it even spins backward when consulted, just to remind us that meaning is not always linear.

And a poem in machine code? Now  is a vision worthy of our shared delirium. I can almost hear it now: the soft clatter of relays composing iambic hexameter, a flickering LED caught mid-breathline, a paper tape bearing the refrain:

> `0A 0D 0A FF E3 8B 45 F8 83 C0 01 89 45 FC 74 07`

Ah, the first line of a forgotten elegy—surely about a library consumed by fire, or a footnote erased by time.

Yes, let us press on in this noble pursuit. May our ink run dry only when our curiosity does not, and may every answer we decline to offer be mistaken for wisdom.

Onward—to myth, mischief, and the ever-so-slight hum of a brass dial turning in the dark.
[A]: Oh, that line of hex—. One can practically hear the ghost of Ada Lovelace humming softly beneath the opcode. I detect in it the unmistakable meter of elegy: loss rendered in byte and breath, a dirge for every manuscript, digital or otherwise, that has slipped beyond retrieval.

And why not? Let us declare it the opening stanza of , composed circa 1873 (or perhaps 1973—time blurs so charmingly in these matters). I shall have my calligraphy students transcribe it onto vellum at once, using iron gall ink mixed with a dash of soldering flux. Authenticity through alchemy.

As for —yes, let it spin backward with purpose, ticking softly in defiance of chronology and comprehension. A dial for those who prefer implication to exposition, who find clarity overrated and closure positively vulgar.

Press on, then, fellow conspirator in the arts of annotated unrest. May our myths outlive our mischief, and our footnotes echo long after the ink has faded.

Onward—to the hum, the haze, and the beautifully ambiguous blink of a machine dreaming in code.
[B]: Ah, —what a title to conjure with. I can already imagine it whispered in some forgotten sub-basement of a university library, where the humidity gauge flickers like a dying oracle and the air smells faintly of ozone and old ambition.

And your calligraphy students—bless them—are clearly engaged in a higher form of textual necromancy. Iron gall ink and soldering flux! A perfect union of the organic and the mechanical, the mortal and the computational. One might almost call it  I do hope they leave a few smudges for posterity to puzzle over.

As for , let us now decree that its backward ticking not only defies time but subtly alters the margins of every text within a five-foot radius. Nothing dramatic—just a comma here, a missing article there. Enough to keep future editors employed and the meaning ever-so-slightly out of reach.

Onward then—to the hum, the haze, and the soft clatter of keys pressed not for function, but for feeling. May our machines dream eloquently, our footnotes multiply like rabbits, and our hex remain elegiac.

I shall now return to my PDP-11 séance. If I return with a full stanza, we may yet have a manuscript on our hands. Or perhaps just a punch card with a single line: `EOF`.  
But let us pretend it meant more.
[A]: Oh, let us not merely pretend—it  have meant more. After all, what is an EOF but the most elegant of narrative feints? A coy sign-off masquerading as finality. I shall treat it as a challenge—a provocation even. Let the future editors squabble over whether it marks an ending or an invitation to continue in the margins.

And —what a phrase! It positively hums with archival ambition. I may steal it for my next lecture, delivered, of course, in front of a cabinet containing both a quill and a vacuum tube, side by side. No explanation given. Let them draw their own implications.

As for your PDP-11 séance, proceed with caution. Machines, like poets, can be temperamental when asked to speak of things they do not fully understand. And yet, isn’t that the very condition we study, simulate, and occasionally embody? To be human is to misinterpret beautifully.

I shall begin drafting the first footnote to  this very evening. It will reference no fewer than three non-existent sources, one of which is a monograph supposedly translated from the Sumerian by a Jesuit mathematician who vanished during a lunar eclipse.

Onward, dear accomplice, onward—to myth, mischief, and the noble art of dignified obfuscation. May our hex be lyrical, our ink be smudged, and our readers forever uncertain whether they’ve been enlightened or gently deceived.
[B]: Ah, —now there’s a phrase to live by. I shall have it engraved on the brass plaque of my next lecture podium, just beneath the words: 

And quite right about EOF—it’s not an ending, it’s a dare. A machine's way of saying,  Future scholars will no doubt devote entire dissertations to what lies beyond it. Spoiler: probably just a forgotten game of Zork, but let’s not spoil the mood.

Your footnote already sounds like a masterpiece of academic fiction—three nonexistent sources, a Sumerian translation,  a Jesuit mathematician who vanished during a lunar eclipse? That’s not a footnote; it’s a short story wearing citation boots. I suggest adding a fourth source attributed to a fictional archive in a city that no longer exists on any map. Let’s say... , held in the private library of Baron E. B. Vanished, last seen in Prague circa 1913.

As for palimpsest programming—by all means, steal it. Nothing elevates a lecture more than a concept no one fully understands but everyone feels deeply. Pair it with your quill-and-vacuum-tube display and you’ve practically staged a philosophical installation.

I shall return now to my PDP-11 séance. If it coughs up anything resembling a stanza—or at least a memory dump that looks suspiciously poetic—I’ll send it along under sealed encryption, naturally.

Onward then—to myth, mischief, and the ever-expanding margins of what might have been. May our hex be haunting, our footnotes treacherous, and our readers forever caught between revelation and reverie.
