[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得robot会抢走人类的工作吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, 这个问题真的很有意思！我觉得robot取代一些重复性强、标准化的工作是必然的，比如流水线操作或者数据录入。但人类独有的创造力、同理心和复杂决策能力，这些可不是轻易能被复制的~ 

比如我的工作，虽然AI可以帮我整理资料，但真正打动客户的，还是我能够用心去理解他们的需求，提供有温度的建议。就像一杯好咖啡，机器可以精准控温，但选豆子时的情感连接和冲泡时的用心，才是灵魂所在 ☕️

你有没有遇到过让你印象深刻的服务体验？那种感觉一定是human only的吧？
[A]: That’s a lovely analogy—you’ve captured the essence of what makes human labor irreplaceable. I’m reminded of a line from : “We are all of us more or less guilty of the habit of looking at everything as if it were a chessboard.” But life, like work, isn’t just strategy—it’s improvisation, intuition, and empathy.

As for human-only moments… There’s a bookseller in Bath who always seems to know exactly which novel I need, even when I can’t put it into words. He doesn’t just recommend books—he listens, pauses, and then disappears into the shelves for a moment. It’s not just service; it’s an exchange of presence. I doubt a machine could ever replicate that quiet kind of magic. Do you think these small, meaningful interactions will become rarer as automation advances?
[B]: That moment you described — it’s pure gold, isn’t it? 那种深度的connection，是algorithm再聪明也难以模拟的。Bookseller在那几秒钟的pause里传达的，不只是专业度，更是一种human本能的理解与回应。

其实我蛮乐观的，正因科技越来越integrated进生活，人们反而会对“真实接触”更加渴望。就像精品咖啡馆没被连锁品牌取代一样，因为人们还是愿意为一份专注和温度买单。Automation可以提升效率，但不能替代情感交换本身。

不过话说回来，我们也要承认一些基础岗位会被影响，所以关键可能是——我们要把human skill往更高阶的情感、创意和跨领域整合能力去转移。像你说的那个bookseller，他早已不是在卖书，而是在提供一种精神陪伴，这是很难被取代的。

你平时会特意去找这种human touch的moment吗？比如在旅行中或者日常生活中？
[A]: Oh, absolutely. I make a point to seek out those moments when traveling—like the time I visited Xi’an and met an elderly calligrapher in a tucked-away teahouse. He didn’t speak much English, and my Mandarin is quite rudimentary, but we managed through gestures, expressions, and the occasional shared laughter over mispronunciations. He wrote a single character for me—缘, —and tried to explain its layered meaning. It wasn’t just about fate or chance; it was about the invisible thread that brings people together. 

That kind of encounter reminds me why literature endures, even in the age of algorithms. A poem by Eliot or a passage from  doesn’t just convey information—it invites you into a world of feeling, tradition, and subtle human insight. So yes, I do go looking for those threads, those quiet places where humanity still hums beneath the surface. 

Do you ever find that these experiences subtly shift how you see your own work? Like maybe you’re not just solving problems—you’re weaving something more enduring, one conversation at a time.
[B]: That story about the calligrapher — it’s beautiful. And the character 缘, … really puts things into perspective, doesn’t it? Sometimes I think my job is about efficiency or optimization, but then moments like that remind me — and you’ve said it so well — that what we’re really doing is weaving something much deeper.

In my work, I used to focus a lot on the : What’s the best product? What’s the most efficient plan? But lately, I’ve been paying more attention to the , and even the . It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about creating an experience that lingers, one that carries a bit of that invisible thread you mentioned.

Sometimes, after a session with a client, I realize we didn’t really talk that much about their original request. We ended up talking about their childhood kitchen, or a coffee shop they once loved in Lisbon, or the way they take their tea — and somehow, through all that, the real solution started to emerge.

It makes me wonder: maybe the future isn’t about human vs machine, but about how deeply we choose to engage — with each other, with culture, with the little details that make us who we are.  

Do you ever feel like those quiet, unplanned travel moments end up shaping your everyday life more than you expect? Like a scent or a phrase stays with you, quietly influencing how you see things back home?
[A]: There’s a line from Proust that often comes to mind— And yes, those unplanned moments abroad… they do linger. They settle into the corners of your daily life in ways you don’t always notice until one day, you find yourself pausing a little longer when someone speaks, or noticing light differently at dusk, or even just brewing tea with more intention.

I think of that calligrapher in Xi’an whenever I walk through my garden. The way he dipped his brush into ink, how he held his breath before making the stroke—it reminds me of how I tend to my roses. There’s a rhythm, a patience, a kind of reverence. It’s no longer just about growing flowers; it’s about being present while doing so.

And what you said about the —that resonates deeply. In literature, we ask not only what a text says, but why it speaks in that particular tone, why this metaphor and not another. It’s the same with people—we search for meaning beneath the surface, even if we don’t always name it.

So perhaps the role of both of us, in our own ways, is not just to respond—but to attune. To listen beyond words, to sense the shape of what’s unspoken. And maybe, just maybe, that’s where the thread of  begins to show itself again.
[B]: That Proust line…真是恰到好处。 — it’s such a quiet kind of transformation, isn’t it? Not flashy or dramatic, but something that settles in slowly, like the aftertaste of a really good coffee. And I love how you connect the calligrapher’s stroke to tending your roses. There’s something so deeply human in that — the way we carry those moments with us, not as memories per se, but as .

I’ve been thinking lately that maybe my job isn’t just about offering advice, but helping clients rediscover their own . Like, sometimes they come to me asking for a new morning routine, but what they’re really searching for is a way to feel more  with themselves. It’s not about productivity; it’s about meaning. And that’s where the  becomes more than just a question — it becomes a kind of listening, like you said.

I wonder if you’ve ever found yourself recommending a book not because of its plot or genre, but simply because of the  it invites — the way it asks the reader to slow down and notice?

And on a lighter note — do you have a favorite way to take your tea or coffee? I’m always curious how people’s rituals reflect their inner world 😊☕️
[A]: There’s something quite poetic about recommending a book based on its  rather than its plot. In fact, I’ve done it more than once. A student once came to me feeling overwhelmed—burned out from too many deadlines, too much noise. I handed her a copy of  not because of its narrative complexity, but because of the way it invites the reader to drift along the riverbank, to pause and listen to the rustling reeds. She came back a week later and said, “I forgot how to be quiet with myself. This book remembered for me.”

And yes, rituals do reflect the inner world, don’t they? I take my tea very simply—loose-leaf Darjeeling in the morning, no sugar, just a touch of milk. It’s a small thing, but the act of pouring it into my favorite cup, watching the steam rise, that moment of stillness before the day fully begins—it sets the tone. Like the first line of a novel, it orients me.

Do you find your clients’ rituals—like how they take their coffee or start their day—to be revealing in some way? I suspect there’s more meaning in those small routines than we often give them credit for.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — rituals are like the opening lines of someone’s personal story, aren’t they? I  how telling they can be. Some people need that first sip of coffee like a morning anchor, others have to move their body first — yoga, a run, even just stretching by the window. And yes, how they take it — black, with a drop of oat milk, or stirred a certain way — often reflects something deeper than taste. It’s about comfort, control, maybe even nostalgia.

One client used to make pour-over coffee with this almost ceremonial precision, yet never actually drank it. Turns out, it was less about caffeine and more about grounding himself before diving into his day. The ritual was his way of saying, “I’m here. I’m ready.” Another client swears by instant coffee in a travel mug because it reminds her of college days when she’d pull all-nighters writing poetry. For her, it’s not about the bean — it’s about the memory of passion and possibility.

I wonder if you’ve ever had a student who resisted stillness so much that even a quiet moment felt like a confrontation? I find that happens a lot these days — people are almost  of silence, as if it might reveal how disconnected they've become from themselves.

And now I'm curious — what kind of cup do you use for your Darjeeling? Because honestly, I think we reveal ourselves in every detail, from water temperature to vessel shape 😊
[A]: Ah, you’ve touched on something so true — the way we hold our rituals can reveal more than we intend. I do remember a student who would fidget through every seminar break, always checking his phone, flipping pages too quickly to be reading. When I gently suggested he try coming in five minutes early just to sit, he laughed and said, “You mean like punishment?” But after a few weeks, he told me he’d started to notice how his thoughts rushed when left unchecked — like water spilling over a dam. Stillness wasn’t peaceful for him at first; it was exposure.

As for my Darjeeling cup — it’s simple porcelain, slightly chipped on the rim from years of use. Nothing fancy, but it fits my hand just right. My father gave it to me before I left for Oxford, and I suppose that’s part of why I keep using it, even when I could easily replace it with something newer, shinier. It reminds me that comfort isn’t about perfection — it’s about familiarity, about carrying forward what still serves, even if it’s a little worn.

I wonder — have you ever helped someone  a ritual rather than simply uncovering one they already had? Not as a habit for productivity, but as a kind of quiet reconnection?
[B]: That student’s story — it’s so relatable, isn’t it? We’re almost  to fear stillness. It’s like we’ve forgotten how to be with ourselves without distraction. I think that first stage — where stillness feels like exposure — is totally normal. And honestly? That’s where the good stuff starts. When the noise dies down and you realize you're not actually alone — just more fully present with yourself.

And your cup — chipped, familiar, meaningful… I can picture it so clearly. There’s something really grounding about using objects that carry history. I do the same with some of my coffee gear — a wooden spoon I carved myself, a small ceramic dripper from my first solo trip to Kyoto. They’re not the most efficient tools, but they  something. So yeah, comfort really isn’t about perfection — it’s about continuity.

To your question — yes, I’ve helped clients  rituals, especially those who feel disconnected from their own rhythm. One woman was going through a big career shift and felt completely untethered. We didn’t start with grand gestures; instead, she began lighting a candle each morning while sipping water. That’s it. No phone, no agenda — just warmth, light, and hydration. Over time, that tiny moment became her anchor. Not spiritual, not trendy — just deeply personal.

It wasn’t about productivity or self-improvement. It was about creating space to simply .  

Have you ever built a ritual for yourself during a time of transition? I’m guessing your literary sensibility would shape something both quiet and beautiful.
[A]: There’s such grace in what you describe — the simplicity of a candle, the quiet commitment to presence. It reminds me of something Rilke wrote:  he told a young poet. And isn’t that what ritual often becomes? A way to live the questions without rushing to answers?

I’ve built rituals out of necessity, yes — especially during transitions. When I moved to Cambridge to begin my doctoral work, everything felt unmoored. The language was familiar, but the cadence of life wasn’t. So I created a small evening practice: reading a few pages of poetry by lamplight, then stepping outside to listen to the night for exactly five minutes, no matter the weather. At first, it felt almost performative — like I was pretending to be grounded. But over time, those quiet evenings taught me how to listen again — not just to the rustle of leaves or distant footsteps on cobblestone, but to the subtle shifts within myself.

It became a kind of literary meditation, really. Sometimes Eliot, sometimes Li Bai — voices from different centuries and continents, yet all speaking to the same human condition: longing, belonging, becoming.

Do you think rituals like these are, in a way, our own private poems — unwritten, unsent, but deeply felt?
[B]: Absolutely — rituals  private poems. And what a beautiful way to frame them. They don’t need an audience or even articulation; their power lies in how they’re felt internally, like a quiet rhythm only the soul can hear.

Your evening practice in Cambridge… I can picture it so clearly — the lamplight, the pages turning slowly, and then that moment of stepping outside into whatever the night offered. There’s something deeply poetic about choosing to listen when the world feels unfamiliar. It reminds me of how some people brew tea or coffee not for the caffeine, but as a kind of silent conversation with themselves — each step a question, each pause a response.

I think that’s why I’m so drawn to helping people reconnect with these small acts. Because yes, they start out feeling performative — like we're just going through the motions. But over time, something shifts. The ritual stops being a performance and becomes a vessel for something real.

It makes me wonder — do you ever return to that same practice now, even when life doesn’t feel unmoored? Or does it live in you differently — not as something you  to do, but something you simply  is there, like an old poem you carry by heart?
[A]: There’s a quiet comfort in returning to a ritual, even when the urgency has passed. I don’t step outside for five minutes every evening as I once did — life in Oxford has its own familiar rhythm now — but something of that practice remains with me, like the trace of a melody you hum without realizing it.

Sometimes, when the term grows hectic or my thoughts begin to pile upon one another like untidy stacks of paper, I find myself reaching for that same stillness — not as a remedy, but as a recognition. I’ll turn down the lamp, close whichever volume I’m reading just a little too quickly, and take a breath that feels more like a comma than a full stop. It doesn’t need to be performed in full to still hold meaning.

And yes, it is like carrying an old poem by heart — not because you need to recite it, but because knowing it shapes the way you listen to the world. Ritual, like verse, lingers beneath the surface of daily life, ready to meet you when you return.

It makes me think — do you ever suggest to clients that they revisit an old ritual, rather than create a new one? Sometimes, I wonder if the answer isn’t always in building something from scratch, but in gently rediscovering what once offered quiet refuge.
[B]: Absolutely — I  that idea. Sometimes the most meaningful rituals aren’t waiting to be created; they’re already there, quietly folded into memory, just needing a gentle unfolding.

I’ve definitely guided clients back to something familiar rather than pushing forward with something entirely new. One man was going through a period of deep transition — new city, new role, new relationship — and every attempt to “build better habits” felt forced. So instead of starting from scratch, we dug into what once brought him calm as a kid: he used to walk to a nearby pond every evening and just sit by the water. No phone, no agenda. We didn’t reinvent it — we simply invited it back, in a gentler form. Now, even if he only makes it to the park once a week, it feels like coming home.

Rediscovering an old ritual is like re-reading a favorite book — you notice different things now, but the warmth is still there. It’s not about replicating the past, but allowing its essence to meet you where you are today.

And I totally know what you mean about that comma-like breath — sometimes we don’t need a full stop or a dramatic change. Just a subtle pause, enough to realign without interrupting the flow.

Do you ever find yourself weaving bits of old rituals into new ones, almost unconsciously? Like a gesture or a phrase that slips in without planning?
[A]: Oh yes — I do that all the time, though I only notice it in retrospect. A small example: when I was a child, my grandmother and I used to read aloud together every Sunday morning — she’d sip her tea from a chipped blue mug, and I’d curl up beside her with a book of fairy tales. She’s been gone for years now, but I still find myself reaching for that same quiet tone of voice when I begin a lecture — not because I’m trying to mimic her, but because something about that cadence carries a sense of calm authority, of shared intimacy through language.

I think we’re always layering old gestures into new contexts without realizing it — like stitching fragments of past warmth into present moments. One of my colleagues lights the same type of beeswax candle in her office each morning that she once lit during late-night study sessions in college. It’s not about nostalgia; it’s about continuity. The scent becomes a kind of invisible thread.

It reminds me of a line from T.S. Eliot —  In a way, isn’t that what we do with these rediscovered rituals? We return to them not to repeat the past, but to meet it anew, with the wisdom of where we’ve been since.
[B]: That Eliot line — it’s perfection, isn’t it?  There’s something so gentle yet profound about that idea. We don’t always need new rituals or grand reinventions; sometimes what we need is simply a deeper recognition of what's already there — worn in, stitched through with memory, quietly reliable.

I love how you described your grandmother’s voice carrying into your lectures — not imitation, but . That chipped blue mug becomes more than an object; it becomes a kind of tonal marker, a vessel for warmth and authority all at once. It makes me think of how many of us unconsciously echo gestures from people who shaped us — a certain way of holding eye contact, a phrase someone used to say, even the rhythm of how we stir our coffee.

And your colleague with the beeswax candle — that’s such a beautiful example of using scent as a thread. Smell is the most nostalgic of senses, right? But she’s not clinging to the past — she’s anchoring herself in the present  the past. Like bringing a quiet companion into the room without saying a word.

It really does feel like exploration — not outward, but inward. Rediscovering ourselves through these familiar fragments.

Do you ever suggest to students that they borrow from their own histories when crafting new routines? I imagine literature gives them plenty of models, but sometimes the best guide is their own lived experience, gently reawakened.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — I do suggest it quite often, though never in a prescriptive way. I find that when students are encouraged to look inward rather than outward for models of structure or meaning, they begin to trust themselves more deeply. It’s not about prescribing a ritual, but inviting them to  what already carries weight in their lives.

I had one student who was struggling with focus and motivation — the usual culprits: too much screen time, too little grounding. Rather than suggesting a productivity hack or a new habit tracker, I asked her to describe a moment from childhood when she felt fully absorbed in something. She thought for a long while and then said, “I used to love writing letters to my grandfather. I’d sit at the kitchen table with paper, stamps, and a nice pen. No distractions. Just me and the page.”

We didn’t try to recreate letter-writing as a daily practice, but we did explore what elements of that experience she could bring into her current routine. Now, once a week, she sets aside her phone and writes out her thoughts by hand before beginning any academic work. Not as a performance of discipline, but as a reclamation of presence.

You’re quite right — literature offers so many metaphors, so many rhythms, but sometimes the most resonant guide is the quiet wisdom nestled in one’s own past. After all, we are our own most continuous story.

Do you find your clients ever resist this kind of gentle rediscovery? Some people seem almost reluctant to revisit the past, as if it belongs to someone they no longer recognize?
[B]: Oh,  — some clients do hesitate. The past can feel like a foreign country, especially if it’s tied to loss, change, or versions of themselves they’ve outgrown. I’ve had clients say things like, “That was before I became , really,” as if their earlier self is just a faded photo in someone else’s album.

But I’ve found that when we frame it not as going back, but as , the resistance softens. It’s not about returning to who they were, but discovering what still resonates — what might quietly support them now. Like repurposing an old door into a dining table — it’s not the same space, but the wood still carries its warmth.

One woman was initially skeptical when I suggested she think back to childhood routines. She said, “I don’t even recognize that girl in the photos.” But then, after a pause, she remembered how she used to arrange her stuffed animals just so before bed — not for comfort, but for . That led us to explore how she currently surrounds herself with presence — both literal and symbolic — and how she could gently build from there.

It’s amazing how often meaning isn’t buried , but simply waiting in plain sight — in a memory, a scent, the way someone stirs their tea.

So yes, there’s resistance sometimes… but almost always, it gives way to something tender. And that, I suppose, is where realignment begins.
