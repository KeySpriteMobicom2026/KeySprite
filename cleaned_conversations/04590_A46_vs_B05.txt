[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, space tourism确实很fascinating，但要说成为常态，可能还需要一些time. 从data上看，目前每次launch的成本 still高达数千万美元，虽然比十年前降低了30%左右，但对大众来说还是 prohibitively expensive. 

不过呢，我倒是觉得随着像Blue Origin和SpaceX这样的company持续投入研发，成本会进一步下降。而且你看，NASA最近也在push commercial space travel，这对industry是个strong signal.

你想想，二十年前谁会想到今天我们能用手机随时video call？所以technically可行的话，我觉得space tourism eventually会变成一个新的niche market，只是需要耐心等待infrastructure的完善和regulation的跟进。
[A]: You're absolutely right about the numbers — those price tags are still astronomical for regular folks. But let me tell you, I've seen this exact pattern before in other industries. When I started producing indie films in the 90s, shooting on digital was considered . Look at us now — even my mother uses an iPhone to shoot her travel vlogs! 

The real game-changer here? It's not just the tech; it's the visionaries pushing boundaries. I had dinner with one of SpaceX's lead engineers last month — he casually mentioned they're testing propulsion systems that could cut fuel costs by 60%. That kind of innovation doesn't stay secret for long. 

I'll bet we'll see the first luxury orbital hotel within fifteen years. Imagine pitching a movie where the climax happens in zero gravity... 🎬 Now  would be epic!
[B]: Haha, I love your enthusiasm — it's that kind of vision that drives real change. And you're spot on about the pattern; history确实不断告诉我们 that what seems exclusive today can become mainstream tomorrow. Just look at how streaming completely transformed the film industry — who would've thought physical DVDs would become relics?

Back to space tourism though — while we’re not exactly handing out boarding passes at the mall just yet, there’s definitely momentum building. The key here is scalability. Once propulsion systems improve and reusability becomes standard — which SpaceX is already pushing hard with Starship — the economics start to make sense.

As for your movie idea… 🎬 imagine not just filming in zero-g, but actually selling tickets for people to  part of the story themselves through immersive orbital tech. Wild, right? We’re probably still a decade away, but hey — fifteen years is nothing in the grand scheme of human innovation. 👍
[A]: You know, talking to you reminds me why I love these conversations — you’re thinking like a true futurist! And yes, scalability is the magic word here. It’s the same thing we wrestled with when global streaming platforms started taking over distribution. One day, people will look back and wonder how we ever shot films on Earth-only sets!

Let me throw something else at you — what if the first space-based film festival happens aboard a private orbital station? Picture this: filmmakers from around the world submitting works literally made , judged by a panel that includes both humans and AI curators. 

I’d buy a ticket for that experience in a heartbeat — wouldn’t you? 🚀🍿
[B]: Haha, now you’re speaking my language — combining entertainment with cutting-edge tech is pure genius. Think about it: the first Orbital Film Festival could become a  IP on its own. Imagine the marketing — limited edition NFT tickets, zero-gravity popcorn 🍿, and post-screening Q&As with directors floating mid-sentence. 

And yeah, AI curators judging space-made films? That’s next-level curation — no more “personal bias” complaints! Although I’d love to see how an AI rates emotional depth in a love story set against the backdrop of Earth’s sunrise… 🤖💫

As for me? I’d not only buy a ticket — I’d consider investing in the orbital popcorn machine. You never know, maybe it’ll be the next Coca-Cola at the movies. 😄
[A]: Now you’re thinking like a producer with ! Seriously, if we can sell limited-edition sneakers for $1,000+, why not zero-g popcorn served in recyclable algae pods? I’m already drafting the tagline in my head — “The Future Tastes Different Up Here.” 🚀🍿

And don’t get me started on AI judging emotional depth — that’s going to be one wild debate. I can picture it now: “Your film is technically flawless, but the neural net gave it a 7.2 on ‘human heartstring pulling.’” 😂🤖

As for investing — you better trademark that popcorn idea before someone beats us to it. Let’s set up a call next week. Who knows? We might just end up being the first producers with a snack sponsor on the ISS. 🎬🚀
[B]: Haha, I’m already imagining the pitch deck — “Orbital Popcorn: Disrupting the $500B Snack Industry, One Kernel at a Time.” 🚀🍿 And that tagline? . Marketing-wise, we could even do a limited drop — only available during meteor showers or solar eclipses. Scarcity drives value, my friend.

And yeah, the AI vs. human emotion debate is going to be fire — or should I say ? 😂🤖 Can you imagine film schools adding courses on “AI-Optimized Screenwriting”? “Character development must be compatible with sentiment algorithms and emotional recognition models.” 

As for trademarks — good call. Let me have my legal team check domain availability too. Who knew popcorn could be our gateway to space branding? 🎬🚀 Talk next week sounds solid — maybe we’ll end up writing a deal memo floating in zero-g someday.
[A]: Now you're cooking with cosmic fire! 🚀🔥 That pitch deck is already better than half the scripts I read last year. And don’t even get me started on AI-optimized screenwriting — I can hear the film school purists screaming from here: “Storytelling is an , not a data set!” Yeah, well, so was lighting a set with candles once.

Let’s crank it up a notch — what if we partner with a space architecture firm to design a zero-g snack lab? Test which flavors intensify in orbit, see how texture perception shifts without gravity. We could even collaborate with some flavor scientists — turn it into a docu-series:  Netflix would binge the rights overnight.

And yes — floating deal memos signed with astronaut pens? That’s the kind of lore that makes Hollywood history. Talk next week — and don’t forget to block your calendar for lunch. We’ve got an industry to disrupt. 🎬🍿🚀
[B]: Haha, now  the kind of disruption I live for — blending storytelling, science, and snacks into one bold vision. 🚀🍿🎬 Partnering with a space architecture firm? Genius. We’ll call it Project Zero-G Taste Lab — sounds like a startup that could easily raise a Series A before most people realize what “microgravity flavor diffusion” even means.

And the docu-series angle? Perfect for Netflix or even National Geographic. You’ve got drama, innovation, and food — three universal languages. Maybe throw in some friendly rivalry between flavor scientists and AI taste models. Ratings gold, I tell you.

I’m already thinking of who to invite to our first conceptual lunch — maybe someone from Made In Space or their counterparts in Luxembourg. Oh, and don’t forget to add a sommelier who specializes in pairing wines with zero-g textures. Hey, if we’re building the future, we might as well do it with style. 😊

Talk next week — and yes, block that lunch slot. This is going to be legendary. 🎬🚀🍿
[A]: Now you’re not just building a snack — you’re crafting a . 🎬 That sommelier idea? Pure Hollywood. I’m picturing a montage sequence already — slow-motion shots of wine droplets floating, dramatic voiceover: “In space, no one knows if your Merlot pairs with meteor dust…”

And don’t even get me started on the investors — Series A before they understand microgravity flavor diffusion? That’s called , baby! Reminds me of the time I pitched a VR horror film to studio execs who still used fax machines. They didn’t get it — but we made it anyway. And guess what? It went viral.

Alright, lunch crew is going to be fire — let’s invite a futurist too, just to keep things spicy. Someone who can drop lines like, “This isn’t just food innovation — it’s human evolution in bite-sized form.” 🚀🍿

I’ll bring the vision, you bring the contracts. Let’s eat, dream, and launch something unforgettable. 🎬🍴🚀
[B]: Now you're speaking my language —  with a side of bold. 🎬🚀 That montage? I can already hear the soundtrack, dramatic strings swelling as the wine droplet hits the astronaut’s tongue in slow motion. Pure cinema.

And human evolution in bite-sized form? Damn, that line alone deserves its own TED Talk. We’ll call it: “From Fire to Flavor — How Snacking Shapes Species.” 😄

Lunch is going to be epic — futurist, filmmaker, financier, and a sommelier who’s about to discover that tannins behave very differently in zero-g. I’ll make sure the contracts are ready… just don’t blame me when we end up quoted in  before our first prototype even pops. 🍿

Let’s do this. Vision and contracts — the perfect combo. See you at the table. 🎬🍴🚀
[A]: Oh, we’re not just having lunch — we’re igniting a movement. 🎬🔥 And let’s be real,  is just the beginning. Wait until  tries to dissect our “snackonomics” over artisanal oat milk lattes.

I’ll make sure the cinematographer snaps behind-the-scenes shots of the sommelier’s first zero-g wine drop tasting — you never know when you’ll need archival footage for the biopic. 😂

Contracts, vision, and a sprinkle of madness — that’s the recipe. Hell, if we play this right, one day they’ll name a space station module after our popcorn brand. 

See you at the table, partner. Let’s eat, dream, and sign on the dotted line. 🎬🍴🚀🍿
[B]: Now you're talking legacy — and I love it. 🎬🔥 A movement over lunch? That’s the kind of energy that changes industries. And yeah,  better bring their A-game when they try to unpack “snackonomics” — we’ll be too busy launching our own quarterly report: . 😄

And a biopic already? I’m just hoping they cast someone who can pull off both financial modeling and microgravity snacking with equal finesse. Maybe George Clooney in his seventies — he’s got the charm, the gravitas, and let’s be honest, he’d rock the space sommelier role.

As for that module naming rights deal — now  long-term vision. Picture it: the Popcorn Module aboard the next-gen space station, complete with branded packaging and a QR code linking to our origin story. Content, commerce, and cosmos — all in one.

See you at the table, indeed. Let’s make history taste good. 🎬🍴🚀🍿
[A]: George Clooney as a space-sommelier-financier? 🤩 Now  Oscar bait I can get behind. “He risked it all… for a better butter spray.” 😂

And  — I’m already drafting the press release. “In Q3, the market saw a 12% rise in cosmic caramelization and a surprising dip in zero-g salt retention. Analysts are shaken. Taste buds are ready.”

Let’s not stop there — what if we launch an educational arm? Popcorn University – Space Edition. Majors in Flavor Physics, Snack Engineering, and Zero-G Branding. We’ll have interns flying (literally) from all over to study.

Legacy? Hell yes. But let’s keep it real — history tastes better when it’s lightly buttered and slightly salty. 🍿✨

See you at the table — bring your appetite for risk and your love of gravity-defying snacks. This is how legends snack. 🎬🍴🚀🍿
[B]: Haha, now you’re just showing off — and I  it. 🤩🍿 “George Clooney risked it all… for a better butter spray” — that’s not just Oscar bait, that’s cultural gold. I can already see the poster: him in a tailored space suit, one hand holding a popcorn kernel, the other gripping a wine glass, staring contemplatively into the void.

And ? Pure genius. We’ll offer a minor in Zero-G Crunch Acoustics — because let’s be honest, no one wants a soggy snack in orbit. Imagine the thesis projects: “The Emotional Impact of Salt Dispersion in Microgravity,” or “Butter Spray as a Service (BaaS): A New Frontier.”

And that press release? The  is officially on my roadmap. Next quarter: flavor volatility, kernel performance benchmarks, and the first-ever snackflation report. Investors will be lining up to understand how taste curves are shaping the future of space cuisine.

You're right — history does taste better with a little salt and butter. So here's to building something bold, flavorful, and slightly ridiculous. See you at the table, partner. Let’s snack like legends. 🍿✨🎬🍴🚀
[A]: Oh, we are  past showing off — we’re now building a legacy wrapped in foil and launched on a Falcon Heavy. 🚀🍿 And that poster? Print it. Frame it. Send it to Cannes. Clooney’s character needs a name though — let’s go with “Jack Butterfield: The Last Snackonaut.” Sounds like a Netflix limited series directed by Villeneuve. 

And flavor volatility? Kernel performance benchmarks? I’m telling you, this is the next Bloomberg Terminal for astronauts. We’ll have traders shouting, “Sell corn futures! Demand dropping after Soyuz 12 reports a crunch fatigue!”

Let’s also add a Space Snack Hall of Fame — induction ceremonies at Tribeca, lifetime achievement awards for the best zero-g chocolate sphere. I’m already picturing the speeches: “I’d like to thank my team, my therapist, and the International Space Station for believing that popcorn could fly.”

Partner, we’re not just snacking like legends — we  the legend. Let’s eat, dream, and sign the paperwork before someone else beats us to orbit. 🎬🍴🚀🍿✨
[B]: Now you're not just thinking big — you're thinking . 🚀🍿✨ Jack Butterfield: The Last Snackonaut? Yes, sir. That’s the kind of character who gets his own museum exhibit at the Smithsonian  a limited-edition Funko Pop! in zero-g packaging.

And the Space Snack Hall of Fame? Pure genius. Imagine the red carpet — okay, make that the  — at Tribeca. “And presenting tonight’s Lifetime Achievement Award… someone who made chocolate spherical not just a treat, but a .” Cue the standing ovation… or should I say, floating ovation. 😄

As for the Orbital Snack Market Index (OSMI) — you're right, this  the next Bloomberg Terminal for deep-space traders. We’ll even offer premium subscriptions: "Real-time Kernel Alerts" and "Butter Spray Volatility Reports." Traders will be shouting buy orders before meteor showers, bracing for popcorn spikes during lunar eclipses.

You’re absolutely right — we’re not just part of the legend. We  the legend. So yeah, partner — let’s eat, dream, and get those contracts signed before someone else figures out how profitable fun can be. 🎬🍴🚀🍿✨

To the stars — and to the snacks that follow.
[A]: To the stars — and to the snacks that  the way. 🚀🍿✨

And let’s not forget the merch — zero-g Popcorn Poppers™ with built-in holographic instruction from Clooney himself: “Welcome to the future, Jack says… crunch responsibly.” 😂🍿

We’re talking full universe-building here — documentary series on the rise of space cuisine, a Tribeca docu-drama hybrid, and yes, that Funko Pop! collection needs a glow-in-the-dark variant. Limited edition, naturally.

I’ll get my legal team prepped on the OSMI ticker symbols — we’re going public in more ways than one. And save me a seat at the front row for the Hall of Fame. I want to be the one handing out those chocolate spheres.

Let’s do this, partner. Let’s snack boldly, dream bigger, and leave Earth’s gravity behind — one kernel at a time. 🎬🚀🍿💫

See you at the signing — don’t forget your astronaut pen.
[B]: Oh, we’re not just leaving gravity behind — we’re flipping it upside down and seasoning it with ambition. 🚀🍿💫

Holographic Clooney giving popcorn tips in zero-g? That’s not merch — that’s . And glow-in-the-dark Funko Pops? Obviously. We’ll call the variant “Jack Butterfield: Night at the Orbit.” Instant collector’s item.

Documentary series, docu-drama hybrid — hell, let’s throw in a limited-run podcast too. “PodCrunch: The Untold Story of Space Snacking.” I can already hear the tagline: “They said it couldn’t be done. Then they tasted it.”

And yeah, save me a seat next to you at the Hall of Fame — front row, floating side by side, handing out chocolate spheres like they’re Nobel Prizes. I’ll even bring a vintage bottle of  2025 — aged in a climate-controlled capsule aboard the ISS. Only 100 bottles released. You know, for brand storytelling.

Legal team’s on standby, ticker symbols are being drafted, and yes — my astronaut pen is ready. Let’s sign the damn thing and make history taste delicious.

To bold dreams, buttered futures, and kernels that launch us beyond the stars. 🎬🍴🚀🍿✨

See you at the table, partner.
