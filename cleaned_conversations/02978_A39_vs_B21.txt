[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy of culinary agency versus convenience. While I find the act of preparing a meal to be a deeply poetic exercise in temporal craftsmanship—each ingredient a stanza, each stir a carefully measured breath—I must confess to succumbing to the siren song of takeout on evenings when my focus leans too heavily into deciphering Christina Rossetti's more cryptic sonnets. There's something almost Victorian about the drama of waiting for a delivery in the rain, don't you think? A modern twist on anticipation, served with a side of soy sauce.
[A]: Ah, I see you appreciate the poetic tension between creation and convenience. You've captured the essence of that particular paradox quite beautifully—almost like a haiku wrapped in a sonnet. Though I must say, there's a certain quiet rebellion in cooking on those rare nights when the world feels too fast-paced; it becomes an act of defiance against disposability culture. But then again, who am I to romanticize chopping onions when I’ve been known to order sushi at 2 a.m. just to watch its delicate geometry unravel on my plate?
[B]: Ah, a fellow appreciator of culinary metaphysics! I’m particularly taken with your phrase “quiet rebellion in cooking”—it conjures images of simmering pots as revolutionary acts, each whisk of steam a whispered protest. I’ve been known to roast parsnips at midnight simply to defy the tyranny of the microwave’s beeping countdown. As for sushi—well, let’s just say I once wrote an entire comparative analysis on the structural parallels between nigiri and Japanese tanka poetry. Layers upon layers, both meant to be consumed… though perhaps not quite as quickly.
[A]: Ah, now there’s a thesis I’d gladly read over miso soup and second helpings of philosophical debate. The structural elegance of nigiri—how it balances form and function, density and delicacy—is indeed not unlike the economy of language in tanka. Each layer speaks volumes with restraint. And your midnight parsnips? Bold, Richard, very bold. Next you’ll tell me you caramelize onions for an hour just to spite the very concept of efficiency. I salute you.
[B]: Oh, Richard— the spark of a man who understands that cuisine is just philosophy with better seasoning. An hour for onions? Don’t be absurd. I once slow-roasted a duck for  hours while reciting Browning aloud, just to see if it would absorb the rhythm of iambic pentameter into its very flesh. (It didn’t, but the neighbours were delighted by the dramatic monologue wafting through the windows.)  
As for your sushi-thesis proposal—mark my words, when the academic world finally wakes up, we’ll have entire departments devoted to Edomae-zushi and E.E. Cummings. Until then, pass the miso—and bring extra chopsticks. We’ve got manifestos to draft.
[A]: Ah, now  is what I call method acting meets molecular gastronomy. Browning and duck—one can only imagine the neighbours torn between calling the fire department or the literary society. And eight hours? My dear fellow, that duck may not have absorbed iambic pentameter, but it surely ascended to some higher avian plane of existence.  

As for departments devoted to Edomae-zushi and Cummings—now  a tenure track worth waiting for. I’m already drafting the first syllabus in my head:  We’ll serve sashimi with seminar readings. Until then, indeed, pass the miso—and let’s get those chopsticks ready. Revolution, after all, tastes better with fermented soybeans.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—fermented soybeans and phenomenology, a pairing long overdue its philosophical due. I’d happily guest lecture on the ontology of radish microgreens, or lead a seminar on the ethics of sesame oil extraction. And that syllabus of yours? Pure genius. —it’s got gravitas, a touch of absurdity, and just enough culinary pretension to scandalize the departmental traditionalists.  

Let them bristle. We’ll be too busy passing the miso, drafting our manifesto between bites. Revolution, Richard, is best served with a side of pickled mustard greens and a well-balanced knife roll.
[A]: Ah, now  is the spirit of gastronomic insurgency I’ve been waiting decades to find. The ontology of radish microgreens alone could topple centuries of dry metaphysical discourse—imagine the conference panels, the grant proposals, the inevitable backlash from the leafy greens lobby. And sesame oil extraction? Ethics in fermentation! We’d have entire think tanks debating the moral implications of miso paste versus powdered dashi.  

Your manifesto deserves not just a knife roll but a full culinary arsenal—sharpened cleavers for rhetorical precision, a mandoline for slicing through academic pretension. And as for pickled mustard greens, yes—sharp, defiant, and slightly pungent, just like our ideals. Let the traditionalists clutch their stale baguettes; we’re building a new canon, one fermented dish at a time.  

Now, where’s that miso? I believe we have a revolution to season.
[B]: Ah, Richard, you’ve struck the precise nerve where gastronomy meets grand theory— with a dash of anarchic flavor. I can already see the headlines:  or  Let the leafy greens sulk; we’ll be too busy composing odes to umami in three-act structure, each act punctuated by a different grade of sea salt.  

And that culinary arsenal? Inspired. I propose we add a mortar and pestle for grinding dissent—preferably filled with black peppercorns and crushed juniper berries. The sharper the tools, the clearer the vision. And yes, let’s season this revolution liberally—after all, what is radical thought without a little heat?  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe the miso has reached its critical temperature. Stir well, serve hot, and let the uprising commence.
[A]: Ah, yes—, a scandal for the ages. I can already picture the tabloid headlines next to earnest think pieces on the BBC:  And you, my friend, with your mortar and pestle of dissent—crushing not just spices, but the very foundations of complacency. Black pepper and juniper, indeed. You're not merely seasoning a dish—you're arming the proletariat with flavor.  

I’ll meet you in this uprising with a blowtorch for the crème brûlée of convention, and perhaps a sous-vide bath for deconstructing old ideologies—slow heat, precise control. And don’t forget the chili oil; revolution needs fire, not just philosophy.  

Stir well, serve hot—and may our miso bowl be the caldron from which a new intellectual order rises. Let the skeptics sip and tremble.
[B]: Oh, Richard, you’ve elevated culinary insurrection to high art—, how delightfully methodical. I can practically hear the slow hum of immersion circulators churning out paradigm shifts. And that blowtorch? Perfect. Let us sear the crust off every comfortable assumption, until only caramelized truth remains.  

As for chili oil—indispensable. What is revolution without a little righteous burn? I propose we bottle our own brand: , a blend of ghost peppers and Hegelian dialectic. Serve with a warning label and a citation from Marx—or perhaps from Márquez.  

And yes, let them tremble as they sip. Our miso bowl shall be both text and crucible, stirred with a wand of批判理论 —critical theory, of course. The new canon doesn’t just taste better—it bites back.
[A]: Ah, now  is a manifesto worth marinating in—aged to perfection in the brine of intellectual defiance. Ghost peppers and Hegelian dialectic? My dear fellow, you’ve found the missing link between gastronomy and grand theory. I can already picture the label on your chili oil: a tiny portrait of Marx glaring sternly above the words   

And that immersion circulator humming away in the corner, slowly unraveling the contradictions of late-stage cuisine—one degree at a time. Yes, let’s sear those assumptions until they blister and crack, revealing the raw, honest flesh beneath. Critical theory with a dash of fish sauce—because even truth deserves seasoning.  

So go on then, stir that miso with conviction. Let our bowls be both nourishment and nightstick. The future tastes better when it burns just a little.
[B]: Oh, Richard, you’ve outdone yourself—, what a sublime notion. I shall age my next treatise in a crock of fermented black beans and existential dread; nothing clarifies thought like a bit of controlled decay. And that label? Perfection. Marx would either approve or sue for trademark infringement—either way, it’s a win for dialectical materialism  branding.  

Let us also not forget the ambiance—revolution requires atmosphere. Dim lighting, the scent of toasted cumin and unresolved tension, the low hum of a record playing Adorno at 33⅓ RPM. Truth  be seasoned, yes, but it must also be  with style. A sprinkle of Sichuan pepper for shock value, a drizzle of sesame oil for gravitas.  

So onward, comrade-chef—our bowls brim with more than soup. They hold the weight of history, the heat of conviction, and just enough salt to preserve our ideals until dawn. Stir well, serve hot, and damn the lukewarm compromisers.
[A]: Ah, now  is a recipe for revolution with proper depth of flavor—fermented black beans and existential dread? My dear fellow, you’ve stumbled upon the secret ingredient all along: . I can already hear the purists gasping in their over-salted bouillons—  

And Adorno at 33⅓ RPM—genius. Nothing sharpens the appetite for change like a slow, deliberate soundtrack to the collapse. Dim lights, yes, but also open flames—metaphorically speaking, of course. Though come to think of it, a few well-placed candles do wonders for the rhetorical ambiance.  

As for Sichuan pepper and sesame oil—indeed, shock and gravitas must always share the plate. Let the compromisers choke on their tepid broth; we dine on fire and theory, and our spoons are sharpened for debate.  

So stir well, serve hot, and damn the lukewarm indeed. The revolution, my friend, is not only coming—it’s garnished.
[B]: Ah, Richard— There it is. The phrase I didn’t know I’d been simmering toward all these years. Let the purists clutch their crystalline consommés; we dine on reduction, on rot, on the glorious unraveling of certainty into something richer, darker, . Wisdom, as you so exquisitely imply, does not sparkle—it simmers.  

And those candles? Absolutely essential. Not just for ambiance, but for symbolism. A flickering flame above a bowl of miso—fragile truth, ever in danger of being snuffed out by the winds of orthodoxy. How dramatic. How necessary.  

As for our sharpened spoons—let them clink against the porcelain of complacency. We are not merely diners, Richard, we are cutlers. Forging flatware from the very marrow of dissent. Stir well, indeed. Serve hot. Garnish with a sprig of heresy and a dusting of praxis.  

The revolution, my friend, is not only garnished—it is 
[A]: Ah, now  a sentiment worthy of both the kitchen and the barricades—wisdom that simmers rather than sparkles. How utterly subversive. And your cutlers? Inspired. For too long we’ve allowed complacency to dine unchallenged, armed only with blunt utensils and softer questions. But —you’re forging spoons that can double as chisels, ladles that moonlight as hammers. A culinary vanguard indeed.

And that sprig of heresy? Essential. No revolutionary dish should ever be without it. I’ll take rosemary soaked in irony, or perhaps a sprig of thyme stolen from Plato’s garden. Praxis is the best seasoning—especially when ground fresh with a mortar of historical contradiction.

Plated with intent, you say? Then let us not merely serve—the revolution deserves . A quenelle of dissent, microgreens of defiance, and a drizzle of manifesto reduction. The critics will call it pretentious. The powerful will call it dangerous.

I say—, comrade. Let history taste this bite.
[B]: Ah, Richard— Now  is a phrase worth carving into the marrow of every bourgeois dining table. Presentation, indeed. Let us plate our convictions with the precision of a master chef and the audacity of a pamphleteer tossing broadsides into the wind. Why merely speak truth to power when we can  it with microgreens plucked from the very soil of defiance?

And your thyme stolen from Plato’s garden? Delightful larceny. I shall pair it with a splash of vinegar—Hegelian, naturally—to awaken the palate of history itself. Let the critics sneer; let the powerful blanch. We are not in the business of comfort, my friend. We are in the business of .

So yes—, comrade. May our broth be bold, our knives sharp, and our aftertaste unforgettable. The revolution is served.
[A]: Ah, —now there's a rallying cry for the ages. I can already hear it carved into the menu of some underground bistro where dissidents gather to sip on bouillon brewed from old constitutions and garnished with shards of broken chains.

And your Hegelian vinegar? Inspired. Nothing cuts through complacency like dialectical acidity—tangy, sharp, and always asking too many questions. Pair it with a starch revolted from the tyranny of gluten, and you’ve got yourself not just a dish, but a movement plated with precision.

Let the critics sneer and the powerful blanch—we dine in the ruins of their certainty, after all. And what is history if not a banquet table still warm from the arguments of those who refused to be digested quietly?

So yes, comrade-chef, let us raise our glasses (recycled from last century’s revolutions) and toast:   

Bon appétit—and damn the second course. We’re busy rewriting the first.
[B]: Ah, Richard— Now  is a broth worth losing sleep over. I can almost taste it: a rich reduction of unfulfilled promises, garnished with the charred crumbs of toppled thrones. And those shards of broken chains? A delightful textural contrast. Nothing says  like a bit of crunch between one's teeth.

And yes—to Hegelian vinegar! Let it sting, let it clarify. A sharp dialectic dressing upon the salad of our times. Pair it with a starch that has  liberated itself—not merely gluten-free, but , roasted in the fire of its own becoming.

As for history as a banquet table—how deliciously apt. We are not merely guests, Richard, we are the unruly aftertaste that lingers on the lips of time. So raise your glass (reused, of course, from some forgotten uprising) and let us toast:

  
  
  

Bon appétit, indeed. Let the old world choke on its own digestifs—we are already setting the table for the new.
