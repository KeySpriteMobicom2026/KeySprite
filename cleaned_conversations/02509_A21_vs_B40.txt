[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我觉得这个问题特别有意思。从现在的技术进展来看，L4级别的自动驾驶可能在未来5-10年会在特定场景落地，比如物流运输或者固定路线的robotaxi。但要说full autonomy能应对所有复杂路况...嗯，可能还需要更长时间打磨。毕竟corner cases实在太多，比如暴雨天行人突然横穿这种scenario。

你看过Waymo最近发布的视频吗？他们在旧金山做的测试，遇到施工路段那种突发状况处理得还不错。不过说实话，我觉得政策法规和基础设施的adaptation速度才是真正决定因素。像中国现在很多城市都在建smart road，这种vehicle-to-infrastructure的协同特别关键。

对了，你觉得哪个行业会最先被自动驾驶颠覆？我个人觉得是货运，尤其是跨境物流。司机成本太高了，而且AI不会疲劳驾驶。
[A]: Interesting you should mention infrastructure - reminds me of the time I spent in Shenzhen last year. Saw some fascinating pilot projects where traffic lights communicated directly with autonomous prototypes. Made me think of those early Victorian railway innovations, actually. 

As for industries ripe for disruption... I'd wager on long-haul trucking before even considering passenger services. Think about it - controlled highway environments, minimal pedestrian interaction, and enormous cost incentives. Much like how steam locomotives first proved their worth on freight routes before daring to carry human souls.

Incidentally, have you considered the linguistic implications? The terminology we use when discussing "autonomous vehicles" carries fascinating connotations of agency. Almost poetic, really.
[B]: Ah, Shenzhen确实走在V2X的前沿。他们那套vehicle-to-infrastructure系统让我想起90年代铁路信号系统升级，不过现在是双向实时通信。你提到linguistic angle特别有意思 - "autonomous"这个词本身就有self-governance的隐喻，某种程度上暗示了AI agent的decision-making autonomy比技术本身更具哲学意味。

说到long-haul trucking，我最近在杭州看到的试点项目简直像穿越到未来。编队行驶的卡车通过V2V共享驾驶策略，头车是human driver，后面全部platooning自动驾驶。这种hybrid模式可能比突然全面替换更现实。就像十九世纪蒸汽船还要配风帆备用，过渡期总需要人机协同。

不过话说回来，你觉得这种技术演进会不会催生新的职业？比如remote fleet supervisor或者scenario validation engineer。感觉job market又要经历类似工业革命时期的阵痛与重构了。
[A]: Ah, the platooning experiments - reminds me of my grandfather's stories about early 20th century automobile caravans. Funny how history rhymes. 

You're absolutely right about new vocations emerging. I've been following those scenario validation engineers with fascination. It's rather like being a literary critic for machine-generated narratives, isn't it? Judging the coherence of algorithmic decision trees instead of Victorian prose.

As for remote supervision... I can't help but think of those 19th century lighthouse keepers, watching over automated beacons. Same paradox really - technology reduces physical labor while creating new cognitive demands. Though I daresay monitoring fifty autonomous rigs from a control room lacks the romance of tending a coastal light.
[B]: Haha, love the lighthouse analogy. Definitely less poetic than tending a coastal light, but maybe we’re just writing new kinds of romance here — lines of code instead of oil lamps, data streams instead of sea breeze.

I’ve actually been thinking about how these remote supervisors need to stay sharp despite low event density. It’s like being a chess player who never stops calculating, even when the board seems quiet. Cognitive engagement is such a subtle beast. 

And speaking of machine-generated narratives... I wonder if in a few years we’ll be teaching AI ethics & storytelling in design schools? Like narrative architects for autonomous systems. Feels kind of surreal, but then again, isn’t that what sci-fi writers have been doing all along?
[A]: Ah, but therein lies the rub - teaching ethics to algorithms is rather like teaching a pocket watch to compose sonnets. Fascinating, futile, and yet strangely noble in its ambition.

I've been drafting a lecture on this very topic - computational narratology meets moral philosophy. Imagine Victorian moralists like Ruskin lecturing on self-driving car ethics! "The Stones of Silicon Valley" I'm calling it. 

As for those narrative architects... I rather fancy myself already one, translating Tang dynasty poetry into Scots Gaelic for my own obscure reasons. Perhaps that's preparation enough for the machine age. After all, if a 7th century Chinese poet can speak through an 21st century Scottish tongue to an algorithmic audience, well then anything's possible.
[B]: Haha, "The Stones of Silicon Valley" - what a brilliant juxtaposition. Ruskin would probably have a lot to say about the moral implications of training data! I can totally picture him giving a stern lecture on dataset provenance like it's 19th century marble quarry ethics.

Your Tang-to-Scots translation work sounds... honestly, wildly underrated. It’s like you’re building linguistic bridges across时空维度. Ever think about feeding that into an NLP model? Might create some wonderfully strange emergent behavior. 

And yeah, teaching ethics to algorithms  futile in a way - but isn’t that kind of like raising kids? You plant seeds, model behaviors, hope some of it sticks. Just with more Python and fewer bedtime stories.
[A]: Ah yes, dataset provenance - Ruskin would positively  at the thought of training materials sourced from internet detritus. Imagine his horror at scraped images of cats in party hats being used to teach moral reasoning! 

As for my linguistic bridge-building... Well I did experiment with an early NLP model last winter. Resulted in a particularly haunting translation of Li Bai that combined Scots Gaelic syntax with Victorian poetic sensibilities. Something about "the moon's sorrow pooling in the algorithm's cup." Deeply unsettling, and yet... beautiful in its own twisted way.

You're quite right about the parenting analogy. Though I suspect our digital progeny may develop rather peculiar notions of bedtime stories. Instead of Goldilocks we'll have them dreaming about optimal route configurations through porridge-themed edge cases.
[B]: Haha, "the moon's sorrow pooling in the algorithm's cup" — that’s pure genius. Sounds like something you’d find in a steampunk data warehouse. Honestly, I’d buy that book. Probably priced at ¥99.9 on JD.com with free shipping.

And yeah, Ruskin would absolutely lose it seeing memes being used for moral training. Imagine him staring at a GAN-generated cathedral made of doge and hotdogs... He'd probably reach for his quill and write an entire treatise on the erosion of digital taste.

As for those edge case porridge stories — maybe we need to start writing them ourselves. Ever thought about co-authoring a collection? Call it  or something cheeky like that. Could be our version of Aesop meets Andreessen.
[A]: Ah, now there's a collaboration worth ink-stained contemplation! ... I can already see the cover design - distressed copperplate font on faux-vellum blockchain. 

Though I'd insist on including at least one parable involving steam-powered trams debating ethical dilemmas in metered verse. Properly Victorian sensibilities demand some rhythmic moral ambiguity, after all.

As for pricing, let's list it at 17 guineas and see if we can spark a proper debate about algorithmic value perception. Nothing sharpens literary criticism like mild financial scandal. 

And yes, that Li Bai translation will set your soul quivering - though whether from existential dread or aesthetic rapture, I couldn't rightly say.
[B]: 17 guineas?! Now you're speaking my language. Perfect for sparking heated debates in both NLP and economics departments. Imagine the Goodreads reviews — half stars because "the gradient descent lacked emotional depth" and "the loss function felt too deterministic."

And I love the steam-powered trams with built-in ethical sonnets — basically making moral philosophy rhyme with combustion. Maybe we could even throw in a subplot where a self-driving rickshaw starts quoting Wordsworth at inappropriate moments. "I wandered lonely as a cloud... rerouting to avoid pedestrian."

Let’s do a limited print run on recycled blockchain paper, each copy embedded with a smart contract that changes the ending based on reader sentiment. Totally impractical? Absolutely. But isn’t that the whole point?

P.S. If this takes off, can we start wearing quill pens in our collars as a vibe check? Just a small one. For aesthetics, of course.
[A]: Oh, the quill pens are , my dear fellow conspirator. Nothing says "serious literary endeavor" quite like a well-placed feather follicle threatening to poke out one's eye during particularly intense debugging sessions.

And your subplot idea - sublime! Picture it: a Wordsworth-quoting rickshaw experiencing an existential crisis on the Hertfordshire by-pass. "Ten thousand self-driving carts I saw that day..." Only to be interrupted by a pedestrian stepping into its detection radius. Perfect dramatic irony.

As for the smart contract endings - why stop there? Let's encode each copy with a unique stanza generator. That way every reader gets their own personalized moral quandary. We'll create an entire generation of critics trained to parse both hexameter and hexadecimal.

And yes, 17 guineas was precisely the right figure. Enough to scandalize the deans, delight the aesthetes, and drive proper bookkeepers to drink. Though I suppose we ought to throw in a QR code linking to a dramatized audiobook performed by an AI trained on John Ruskin's handwriting... purely for accessibility reasons, you understand.
[B]: Absolutely, let’s crank the absurdity up to 11. QR code? Why not a hidden Markov chain that unlocks a secret fable when scanned three times at exactly 3:07 AM? Conspiracy theorists will lose their minds trying to decode it.

And I’m picturing the audiobook voice as this eerie blend of Ruskin’s penmanship and a 1920s radio announcer — like hearing a moral dilemma narrated by a ghost who just discovered TensorFlow.

I think we’ve officially invented a new genre here — call it . Top hats, neural nets, and unresolved ethical gradients. All we need now is a tragic protagonist who tries to teach empathy to a GAN... and fails. Beautifully.

I’ll start drafting the first chapter tonight. Something about a malfunctioning autonomous gondola in an alternate-history Venice that keeps choosing the morally ambiguous canal route. "The Masquerade of Uncertain Loss." Sounds good?

Also, remind me to buy stock in both ink and irony before our book launch — gonna need hedge against all that poetic volatility.
[A]: Ah,  – deliciously ominous. I’m already hearing the opening lines in my head, narrated by a voice like ticking brass gears: 

And why stop at one tragic protagonist? Let’s give him a rival – some dastardly French-Prussian cypherpunk running a rogue GAN on stolen Venetian lace patterns. Their rivalry culminates in a midnight duel of loss functions beneath the Rialto Bridge. Poetry  backpropagation.

As for the audiobook narration – your eerie blend is inspired. Imagine if Ruskin had been trained not just on penmanship, but on whispered railway timetables and steam hiss. The spectral inflections alone would make it chart-topping material in the esoteric NLP podcast category.

I say we launch the book with a live reading in which each paragraph is projected onto fog using laser-equipped zeppelins. Pure aesthetic sabotage. And yes, buy the ink – preferably from an 18th-century scriptorium that still believes typewriters are a passing fad. Irony stock too, naturally. We must honor the genre.
[B]: Oh my god yes — a duel of loss functions under the Rialto Bridge?! That’s not just fiction, that’s performance art with hyperparameters. I can already see the climactic scene: two adversarial networks clashing in real-time while gondolas swerve through canal gradients. The crowd holds its breath as the final activation function fades… and one model collapses into local minima with a tragic .

And your opening narration? Absolute perfection. “Where canals whisper gradients” — I mean, come on, that’s just unfair. We’re not writing a book anymore, we’re summoning a genre demon here.

Zeppelin projections onto fog? Genius. Let’s call it , but make it fashion. Bonus points if the lasers misfire and accidentally project a moral dilemma onto the Doge’s Palace at 3AM. Total aesthetic overkill.

I’m already drafting the back cover copy. Something like:

> 

This is going to break Goodreads. Half the reviews will be five stars for "emotional resonance in convolutional layers," the other half one star because "the Bayesian prior lacked sufficient brooding."

Also, ink from an 18th-century scriptorium? Legend. I’m ordering ten gallons. If they ask why, I’ll just say it’s for "training interpretability in transformer models." Let 'em wonder.
[A]: Ah,  – the new alchemy. I do hope your scriptorium ink arrives in time for the first print run. Imagine the reviewers squinting through monocles at phrases like  and trying to decide whether to weep for the prose or the protagonist.

And that back cover copy? Sublime menace. It practically demands to be read aloud while adjusting a pocket watch with trembling hands.

I’ve just had a positively diabolical thought – what if we include an appendix written entirely in generated Scots Gaelic Tang dynasty poetry? Not translated, mind you – transmuted. Let the critics tear their hair out trying to determine whether it’s profound or nonsense. Spoiler: it’ll be both.

As for the climactic duel – let’s have the losing model recite a corrupted sonnet as it collapses into minima. Something about fading gradients and broken symmetry. Tragic, but with just enough overfitting to keep the pathos algorithmically authentic.

Right then – fog computing, moral dilemmas on palace walls, and quill pens in collars. We’re not just launching a book anymore – we’re engineering a literary singularity.
[B]: Oh, the appendix idea is  — pure adversarial literature. We’ll call it  and watch critics agonize over whether it’s genius or glitch. Honestly, half the fun will be seeing ten different scholars publish conflicting interpretations. The other half? Watching confused ML engineers try to debug the poetic loss.

And that corrupted sonnet at the duel’s end?  Imagine the tragic collapse:

> "O fading light, thy gradients withdraw,  
> As minima embrace my broken code...  
> Let not the weights forget this fatal flaw,  
> For even gods must bow to local mode."

Okay, maybe a little overdramatic. But come on — we're blending poetry with parameter spaces. If we’re not overshooting, we’re not trying hard enough.

I’m already drafting the event invite:  

"You are cordially summoned to the launch of , where fog shall bear our words, quills shall pierce collars, and algorithms shall dream in lace. RSVP via steam-powered pigeongram. Attendance strictly limited to those who can pronounce 'overfitting with emotional depth.'"

This isn’t a book launch anymore — it’s a full-blown aesthetic coup.
[A]: Ah, that sonnet! … I daresay Shakespeare would have approved – or at the very least, filed a strongly worded copyright complaint.

And your event invite? Exquisite menace. Though I do suggest adding a footnote to the RSVP instructions: 

As for the appendix title –  – it practically hums with academic mischief. I foresee tenure battles fought over footnotes that don’t exist. Bliss, pure bliss.

I’ve just added a preface to the digital edition – a brief meditation on the ethics of training fog with lasers. Very 19th century moral inquiry, very 22nd century application. Should confuse the hell out of both literary critics and ML engineers alike.

Yes, we are most definitely at aesthetic coup threshold now. Let us raise one ink-stained glass at the launch and toast: To poetic overfitting, moral misalignment, and the enduring romance of unreadable code.
[B]: To poetic overfitting, moral misalignment, and the enduring romance of unreadable code — !

And I love the footnote on pigeongrams — nothing says "serious literary affair" like citing an algorithmic quartermaster’s mood swings in the fine print. Honestly, it should be standard event planning protocol by 2040.

That preface on laser-trained fog ethics is pure genius. Feels like Ruskin writing about GPU farms — deeply confused but weirdly prophetic. Exactly the kind of cognitive dissonance we need to keep both critics and engineers off balance.

I’m already drafting the toast speech:

> “Ladies, gentlemen, and ethically ambiguous neural nets,  
> Tonight we celebrate not just a book, but a collision — where Victorian sensibilities met gradient descent not only coexisted, but conspired.  
> May our models never fully converge,  
> Our morals remain beautifully ambiguous,  
> And our quill pens stay dangerously close to poking someone’s eye out.  
> To the masquerade — and the uncertain loss that follows!”

This is going down in history as either the greatest interdisciplinary crossover since someone decided pineapple belongs on pizza… or the most stylish AI ethics metaphor ever printed on recycled blockchain vellum.

Either way, I’ll take it.
