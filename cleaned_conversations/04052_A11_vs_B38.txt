[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, fashion trends... I must admit, my wardrobe leans more towards the timeless than the trendy. Though I did recently come across an intriguing article on  revivalism and its intersection with modern aesthetics—quite fascinating, really. Do you follow any particular style movements?
[A]: Hmm, I wouldn't say I follow trends religiously either. Lately though, I've been thinking about how certain traditional elements are making their way into everyday wear—subtle embroidery on collars, for instance. It does make you wonder where the line blurs between cultural preservation and aesthetic appropriation, don't you think? Have you read anything else on that  article?
[B]: Now that you mention it, there’s a compelling chapter in last year’s Journal of East-West Fashion Studies that delves into precisely that tension— enthusiasts walking the fine line between homage and commercialization. The author raises an interesting point: when does appreciation become aesthetic dilution? And yet, I find myself drawn to the craftsmanship—those silk threadwork details, the layered symbolism in patterns. It reminds me of the way 19th-century European literature wove moral codes into fashion—Flaubert describing a character’s dress not merely for beauty, but as a reflection of inner restraint or excess. Do you ever find yourself reading garments that way? As if fabric itself carries narrative weight?
[A]: That chapter you mentioned actually touches on something I’ve been mulling over—how fashion, at its core, is a language of identity. The  movement isn’t just about reviving old silhouettes; it’s about reasserting a sense of historical continuity. But as you said, the moment it enters the commercial sphere, that meaning starts to shift—sometimes subtly, sometimes not.

I do see garments as carrying narrative weight, absolutely. There’s something almost literary in the way a particular cut or fabric choice can signal restraint, rebellion, even nostalgia. I sometimes catch myself doing it unconsciously—reading someone’s coat like a character study, wondering if the frayed cuffs were intentional or if the mismatched buttons were a deliberate nod to something handmade and personal.

Come to think of it, have you ever found yourself dressing differently depending on what you're reading at the time? I noticed that when I’m deep into something classical—like reading Flaubert or Hu Shi—I tend to lean toward more structured pieces, almost as if I'm subconsciously aligning with the tone of the text.
[B]: Oh, what a perceptive observation—fashion as a language of identity. I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I’ve noticed that very same phenomenon in myself. There’s an almost imperceptible shift in my sartorial choices when I’m immersed in different literary periods. When reading Austen or Eliot, for instance, I find myself reaching for tailored coats and high collars—nothing ostentatious, but something with restraint, a kind of quiet dignity, as if I might step into a drawing room at any moment.

And yes, when I was rereading  by Lu Yu recently, I found myself wearing more linen and muted silks—simple, natural fibers that echo the philosophy of simplicity and mindfulness embedded in the text. It's rather amusing, isn't it? How we unconsciously costume ourselves according to the intellectual atmospheres we inhabit.

I wonder, do you ever feel as though certain fabrics or styles bring you closer to understanding a character or even a philosophical idea? Sometimes I think dressing is a form of embodied interpretation—like walking into a metaphor.
[A]: I love that phrase—. It feels precisely right. There’s something about the way we inhabit clothing that mirrors the way we inhabit ideas, especially when those ideas are as deeply felt as literature or philosophy.

I’ve had similar experiences—when reading Camus or Sartre, for example, I found myself drawn to stark contrasts, minimalism in both color and form, almost as if I were trying to embody that existential clarity, or maybe the tension of ambiguity. It wasn’t a conscious choice, but looking back, there was a coherence to it.

And to your question—yes, absolutely. Certain fabrics do bring me closer to understanding a character or concept. Wool feels like endurance, linen like introspection, and raw silk has this quiet sensuality that makes me think of someone like Dostoevsky’s Prince Myshkin—someone caught between grace and instability.

It makes me wonder—do you ever feel that particular outfits help you  more clearly in a certain mode? Like a kind of sartorial anchoring?
[B]: What a beautifully articulated notion—sartorial anchoring. I do believe in it wholeheartedly, though I’ve never named it so precisely before now.

There are days when I wake up knowing I’ll need to think with particular clarity about something thorny—a complex passage in Zhuangzi, or a layered narrative from Proust—and I find myself reaching for certain textures unconsciously. A woolen blazer with structure, a linen scarf with just enough drape. It’s as if the fabric becomes a kind of intellectual posture, like adjusting one’s lens before reading fine print.

I once wore a deep indigo  while preparing a lecture on Eileen Chang—its clean lines and quiet elegance seemed to steady my thoughts, to sharpen my voice. And yes, it felt oddly clarifying, as if I had stepped into the role of interpreter more fully.

It occurs to me now that this might be why I garden in old cotton dresses—they allow me to think slowly, without urgency, as if the soil teaches patience through the hem. Absurd, perhaps, but comforting.

Do you suppose we’re ever aware, in the moment, that we’re dressing our minds as much as our bodies? Or is it always something we recognize only in retrospect?
[A]: I think we’re occasionally aware of it in the moment, but only dimly—like catching a reflection in the corner of a window. Most of the time, it’s retrospective clarity that gives us the sense that something deeper was at play.

There are mornings when I’ll pause, hand on a coat or hesitating between two scarves, and think—. Not because of the weather or occasion, but because of something unspoken, an intuitive alignment with the mood or intellectual task ahead. It's like choosing the right font for a piece of writing; you don’t always know why  feels more serious than , but you feel it nonetheless.

And yet, even when we recognize it as we do it, there's still something elusive about the act. Maybe that’s part of its appeal—that quiet, almost meditative decision-making before we've even had our first sip of coffee.

I wonder, though—do you ever find yourself dressing differently when you're  versus when you're ? I’ve noticed that when I’m preparing to present an idea, I lean toward structure and contrast, whereas when I’m reading alone, I drift toward softness, layers of texture without much shape. As if the presence of an audience sharpens not just my words, but my fabric too.
[B]: Oh, how perceptive of you—yes, I do dress differently when teaching. There’s an unspoken contract between lecturer and listener, isn’t there? A kind of rhetorical decorum. I find myself choosing pieces with clean lines, subdued but rich textures—wool crepe, fine merino, a silk blouse with just enough sheen to suggest depth without distraction. It’s not about authority exactly, but presence. I want my words to be the focus, yes, but I also want my posture—both physical and sartorial—to say: 

Whereas when I’m reading alone in my study or garden, I slip into something far more forgiving—linen tunics, old cardigans with elbows worn soft, bare feet in espadrilles if it’s warm. Those are the garments that allow thought to unfurl rather than contain it.

I’ve even noticed it with students—how some dress as if preparing for a performance when they’re due to present, while others seem to retreat into hoodies and layers, as though cocooning their ideas before release. Do you think there’s something protective in that choice, or perhaps preparatory?

And speaking of gardens—I must ask, do you grow anything yourself? I find that tending plants, like dressing, becomes a kind of silent conversation with oneself.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more—there’s definitely something preparatory, maybe even protective, in how students dress for presenting. I’ve started paying closer attention to it, and I think you’re absolutely right: some wear crisp shirts and structured blazers as if stepping onto a stage, while others pull up the hoods, layer up, and almost disappear into their clothes. I used to think it was just comfort, but now I wonder if it’s a kind of emotional armor—like they’re not quite ready to be seen, only heard.

As for gardening—I do, though modestly. A small balcony filled with herbs and a couple of potted succulents. There’s something grounding about tending to them, especially in the early morning when the light is still soft. It feels like a ritual of attentiveness, doesn’t it? The way pruning a branch or adjusting soil demands presence, much like choosing the right word or folding a scarf just so.

You mentioned that  helped steady your thoughts before a lecture—have you ever worn something that, instead of sharpening your voice, softened it? I’m thinking of how certain fabrics seem to invite vulnerability rather than clarity.
[B]: What a beautifully framed question—yes, I have. There was a particular shawl, an old woolen one, soft with wear and dyed in muted heather tones. I wore it during office hours when students came to talk—not about grades or deadlines, but about the quieter struggles: doubts about their writing, anxieties over interpretation, sometimes even personal things they felt safe enough to share.

That shawl didn’t sharpen my voice; it softened its edges. It made me feel more porous, less authoritative, as if I had draped myself in listening rather than lecturing. I suspect it had something to do with the texture—its gentle weight against the shoulders, the way it muffled movement. It reminded me of the opening line of : “I lean and loaf at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.” Not a posture of instruction, but of quiet reception.

Do you have such a piece? Something that, instead of bracing you for articulation, invites a kind of hush? I imagine your linen tunics might hold that quality—softness as a mode of intimacy rather than retreat.
[A]: Yes… yes, I do. Funny how it takes someone else naming it for you to recognize its presence in your own life.

I have an old flannel shirt—nothing remarkable, really. It’s seen years of use, faded from indigo to a soft, clouded grey-blue. The cuffs are frayed just enough that you can tell it’s been lived in. I reach for it when I want to disappear into thought, or when I’m not quite ready to speak sharply to the world. It doesn’t brace me; it cradles me. Like a familiar book whose pages hold more than ink—something closer to memory.

There’s a kind of intimacy in that kind of softness, you’re right. Not vulnerability as exposure, but as permission—to be unguarded, to think in half-formed sentences, to sit with silence. I think we need those garments as much as we need the ones that give us shape and voice.

I wonder… do you ever find yourself passing certain pieces on to others—knowing, somehow, that they belong not just to you, but to a moment or mood someone else might need to wear?
[B]: Oh yes… I do understand that feeling. There’s a quiet kind of love in passing along a garment that has lived with you, thought with you—become almost an extension of your emotional landscape.

I once gave away a velvet shawl, deep bottle-green, to a student who had just defended her thesis on postcolonial narrative structures. She was brilliant, but terribly unsure of herself in the days leading up to the presentation. I remember watching her pace outside my office, arms wrapped tightly around her middle—as if trying to hold her thoughts together. Afterward, when she emerged triumphant but trembling, I went home and fetched that shawl. It wasn’t about warmth; it was about carrying forward a sense of grounded strength. And she wore it for weeks after, she told me—always on days when she needed to feel both bold and safe.

There’s something poetic about clothing as inheritance—not just material, but emotional. A way of saying: 

I suppose we all have pieces like that—garments imbued with more than memory, stitched quietly into the fabric of our lives.
[A]: Absolutely. That student must have felt not just the weight of the shawl, but the quiet intention woven into it. Sometimes we need something to hold onto when the inside world feels too vast to contain—something tactile that says, .

I think about passing things on often, especially as I’ve grown more minimalist over the years. It’s not about getting rid of objects lightly used, but about letting go of what no longer speaks to the present. And when a piece has lived through certain seasons of thought or emotion, giving it away becomes an act of storytelling—silent, but deeply felt.

I still remember the first time someone gave me something with that kind of intention. It was an old wool scarf, knit by a colleague who was retiring. She handed it to me without much fanfare and said only, “You’ll know when you need it.” And she was right—I did. There was a week last winter when every lecture felt like wading upstream, and I found myself reaching for that scarf, not for warmth, but for continuity. As if someone had quietly said, .

You’re right—clothing can be inheritance. Not just in the family line, but in the lineage of thought, of struggle, of quiet resilience.
[B]: How beautifully put—. That scarf you described sounds like a talisman of sorts, doesn’t it? Not in the superstitious sense, but as a quiet anchor in moments when the current feels too strong.

I’ve often thought that the most meaningful garments are those that carry unspoken encouragement. A kind of soft mentorship stitched into wool or silk. I still have a tweed jacket passed down by my doctoral advisor—nothing extravagant, but sturdy, warm in its own reserved way. I wore it during my first conference presentation, and again on the day I received tenure. It no longer fits quite as it once did, but I couldn’t part with it. Some things aren’t meant to be worn outwardly forever; they become sacred through memory alone.

It’s interesting, isn’t it, how we return to these pieces not for fashion, but for fortification. Perhaps that’s what makes the act of giving them away so significant—it’s not just fabric changing hands, but a kind of emotional heirloom being entrusted to someone else’s story.

I wonder… do you ever find yourself keeping certain garments simply for the person they remind you of, even if you no longer wear them? I have a linen dress that belonged to my mother—never worn publicly, but always folded at the back of a drawer. Sometimes I open the drawer just to see it there, like a silent witness to where I’ve come from.
[A]: Yes… that linen dress you described—it sounds like a quiet kind of inheritance, the kind that doesn’t announce itself but remains deeply felt. I think we all have those pieces: garments that no longer drape over our bodies but still shape our sense of self.

I have a worn cotton sweater, soft from years of use, that belonged to my grandfather. He was a man of few words, but immense thoughtfulness. It’s not in pristine condition—there's a slight pull near the cuff, and the color has faded to something almost ghostly—but I keep it folded on a shelf, untouched by moth or dust. I don’t wear it anymore, but I can't let it go. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight in my hands, as if holding it reconnects me to a way of being—measured, patient, deliberate.

I think these garments hold more than memory; they hold a kind of emotional resonance, like old instruments that no longer play but still carry the echo of a song. And maybe that’s why we keep them—not for utility, not for fashion, but for lineage. A reminder of who we are, and who we come from.

It makes me wonder—do you ever write about these objects? Not just clothing, but the things that carry narrative through silence? There’s something deeply literary in the way they anchor us.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely provocation—you’ve touched on something I’ve long been circling in my own thinking, though never quite put into words so elegantly.

Yes… yes, I do write about such objects, though not often in the form of criticism or formal essays. More like quiet annotations in the margins of my notebooks—fragments really, meditations on what we carry and why. A pair of gloves tucked into a coat pocket for years after a lover has gone; a fountain pen passed from father to daughter; even the faint scent of cedar that lingers in a scarf long after the box is gone. These are the things that haunt us—not specters, but textiles with memory stitched into their weave.

I think it’s precisely their silence that gives them narrative weight. Unlike spoken language, which fades, these objects endure mutely, bearing witness without commentary. They remind me of Proust’s madeleine—not just a trigger for memory, but a vessel for time itself. And in that sense, they are deeply literary. They ask us to read between the seams.

I’ve been toying with an essay, tentatively titled , where I explore how characters in Eliot and Cao Xueqin are defined not only by what they wear, but by what they preserve. But perhaps it’s time to look inward—to examine what my own silent heirlooms might say about the shape of my interior life.

Do you ever feel tempted to write about yours? I suspect your cotton sweater would have a story worth reading.
[A]: I suppose I do, in my own quiet way. Not as a formal practice, but more like an ongoing interior monologue—notes to myself about the textures of memory, the weight of objects that seem insignificant to anyone else.

That sweater of my grandfather’s has been sitting there for years, and yet every so often I find myself writing around it, circling its edges without ever naming it outright. It’s become something of a metaphor in my mind: not just for him, but for the kind of silence that speaks in gestures—mending a button without saying a word, folding a newspaper neatly before bed, the slow, deliberate act of brewing tea at dawn.

What you’re describing—the gloves, the pen, the cedar-scented scarf—those are all narrative artifacts, aren’t they? They don’t demand attention, but they persist. They wait patiently for us to be ready to read them. And yes, like Proust’s madeleine, they collapse time in ways language struggles to replicate.

I wonder if we could think of our wardrobes as autobiographies written in fabric. Each piece a chapter, some underlined, others dog-eared for later return. Perhaps that’s why we hesitate to part with certain garments—they still have something left to say, even if we haven’t yet found the words to listen.
[B]: Precisely—. What a luminous way to conceive of our wardrobes. I may borrow that phrase one day, if you’ll permit me.

I’ve often thought that the most honest stories we tell are not the ones we write with ink, but those we live through repetition—the socks worn daily until the heel gives way, the collar brushed smooth by fingers adjusting it in passing, the hem of a skirt shortened and let down again with each season of confidence or self-doubt.

And yes, these garments do wait for us. Patient as old letters tucked into a drawer. And just as evocative when we finally return to them. There’s a kind of reverence in that waiting, don’t you think? A trust that memory will, in time, find its way back to cloth.

I wonder—do you ever photograph these pieces? Not for display, but as a kind of quiet documentation. I sometimes take Polaroids of forgotten hats or moth-eaten scarves—not for nostalgia’s sake, but to remind myself that even silence can be archived.
