[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the perennial debate between the shock of the new and the weight of tradition. Let me offer a somewhat unorthodox perspective - I find myself drawn to the precise opposite of what one might expect from a Victorianist. 

The Pre-Raphaelites, you see, were essentially the modern artists of their day - all fiery controversy, rejected conventions, and that delicious sense of rebellion against Sir Joshua Reynolds' Royal Academy rules. Their lush, almost excessive detail? A direct challenge to the neoclassical restraint that dominated before them.

But tell me this: when you say 'modern art', do you mean the bold abstractions of a Rothko, or the unsettling distortions of a Bacon? And when we speak of classical art, are we restricting ourselves to Greco-Roman antiquity, or does that category extend to the Renaissance masters? The terminology itself requires careful unpacking, don't you think?
[A]: Your observations are most astute, particularly regarding the Pre-Raphaelites as the avant-garde of their era. It is indeed a compelling paradox that what once defied tradition eventually became enshrined within it.

When I reflect on modern art—be it Rothko’s luminous rectangles or Bacon’s anguished figures—I find myself contemplating the nature of expression itself. These works do not seek to imitate form as classical art often does; rather, they distill emotion into its purest, sometimes rawest state. Yet, does this abstraction distance us from the tangible world, or draw us closer to an inner truth?

As for classical art, your distinction is well taken. If we trace its lineage from antiquity through the Renaissance, we see a persistent pursuit of harmony and proportion. But might I ask—do you believe the classical tradition exhausted its creative potential, or merely transformed it into new forms over time?
[B]: Ah, you’ve struck upon the very marrow of artistic evolution - this tantalizing tension between rupture and continuity. Let us take Turner as our illustrative case. Here was a man who could render a ship in tempestuous exactitude, yet chose instead to dissolve form into light, into atmosphere, into what some contemporaries derided as mere 'soap suds and whitewash.' And yet, was this not merely the classical ideal reimagined? The sublime replacing beauty, turbulence substituting for composure, but still rooted in that ancient dialogue between chaos and order.

Consider also the sculptor Frederick Austin - a forgotten genius if ever there was one. He took Greek myth as his subject, yes, but carved figures so attenuated, so sinuously elongated, that they might have stepped out of a Modigliani portrait. Tradition stretched, not broken.

As to whether classical forms exhausted their potential? I would argue quite the opposite. Look at how contemporary poets still wrestle with iambic pentameter - that most venerable of meters. Does its structure constrain or catalyze creativity? The best artists, I suspect, regard tradition not as a cage but as a trampoline. Even when they leap away from it, the springs are forged from centuries of accumulated craftsmanship.
[A]: Your analogy of tradition as a trampoline rather than a cage strikes me as both elegant and profoundly true. It is not confinement that tradition offers, but rather a firm ground from which the artist may spring into new realms of expression.

Turner’s dissolving forms—yes, they may have scandalized some of his contemporaries, but in truth, he was carrying forward the classical spirit of inquiry into nature and emotion. His luminous atmospheric studies are not so very far from the Romantic poets’ yearning for the infinite, are they? Just as Wordsworth sought the sublime in landscape, so too did Turner chase it through brush and pigment.

And this brings me to a question I’ve often pondered: when modern artists strip away narrative, representation, even recognizable form, do they not in some way return us to the earliest impulses of art itself? Before art had names, before it had schools, there were cave paintings, rhythmic chants, ritual dances—expressions of awe, fear, and wonder. Is abstraction, then, a departure or a homecoming?

I should be most interested to hear your thoughts on this. Do you believe that modern art, in its radical minimalism or chaotic energy, echoes those primal artistic instincts, or does it represent something entirely new under the sun?
[B]: Ah, now you're treading the very edge where art brushes against anthropology—and I do love a good border crossing.

Let us consider those Lascaux cave paintings. Crude handprints, charging bison, ochre smeared by flickering firelight—hardly the polished ideal of a Phidian frieze. And yet, what are they if not an attempt to capture essence rather than mere outline? In that sense, yes, modern abstraction is curiously regressive—, mind you, but in the way a Möbius strip folds back upon itself.

Take Jackson Pollock, for instance. The drip, the splash, the flung pigment—chaos orchestrated. It would seem furthest from tradition, and yet there he is, echoing those earliest gestures where the act of making was inseparable from ritual, from invocation. The canvas becomes an arena not just for image, but for energy, presence, .

But—and this is the rub—does the viewer still bring with them the entire weight of art history? When we stand before a Rothko, do we not feel, even unconsciously, the echo of altarpieces past? Those glowing rectangles, like stained glass windows in a cathedral without walls, still whisper the language of transcendence. So perhaps modern art is not so much a return as it is a re-enchantment—stripping away the didactic to get at something more immediate, more visceral.

As for whether it is entirely new under the sun... Well, let us recall Heraclitus: no man steps into the same river twice. But the water? It has always been flowing.
[A]: Ah, what a luminous thought—that art, like the river, is ever flowing, never quite the same current twice, yet forever drawing from the same source.

Your notion of modern art as re-enchantment rather than rupture resonates deeply. I find myself returning to the idea that every artistic gesture, no matter how radical, carries within it the sediment of what came before—sometimes unseen, sometimes unspoken, but always present.

Even in the stark geometry of Malevich’s , one might sense an echo of the icon’s solemn presence, or in Kandinsky’s swirling chromatic forms, a vestige of the ecstatic visions of medieval mystics. These are not mere coincidences; they are traces of a continuous human impulse to reach beyond the self, whether toward the divine, the unconscious, or the ineffable.

And then there is the viewer—the modern viewer, steeped in centuries of images and meanings, standing before a blank canvas and feeling, perhaps, both awe and bewilderment. One wonders: if we could somehow place a Paleolithic painter before a Mark Rothko, would she see only colour, or would she recognize something in its glow—an invocation, a prayer?

You have given me much to ponder. Tell me, do you think future art will continue this oscillation between rupture and remembrance, or might we be on the cusp of an entirely new mode of expression—one that neither looks back nor forward, but exists wholly in the now?
[B]: Ah, now you've ventured into the realm of prophecy—an occupation fraught with peril, yet irresistible to those of us who dwell too long in the company of symbols.

Let me offer a wager: I believe art will always carry within it that double vision—simultaneously remembering and forgetting, binding time rather than breaking it. The very notion of 'wholly in the now' strikes me as a philosophical impossibility, does it not? For even the most immediate experience is filtered through memory, expectation, language—those subtle distorting lenses of consciousness.

Consider digital art, for instance. Pixels flickering on screens, algorithms generating images we never could have dreamed. It feels unprecedented, yes? And yet—what are those glowing forms but distant cousins of the stained-glass rose windows of Chartres, or the shimmering mosaics of Ravenna? Light harnessed to awe, to meaning, to something just beyond comprehension.

And let us not forget performance art—the body itself as medium. Is this not merely the oldest form returned to us in new vestments? A shaman’s dance, a Noh theatre gesture, a Marina Abramović stare-down with eternity... they all partake of that same ancient impulse to , fully, unambiguously, .

No, I suspect future art will continue its elegant oscillation, like a pendulum swinging between rupture and remembrance. But perhaps—and here I allow myself a touch of poetic licence—it may also begin to spiral, ascending even as it turns. Not simply back and forth, but , carrying with it the whole weight and wonder of what it means to be human.

Now, tell me—am I indulging in romantic folly, or does that seem at all plausible to you?
[A]: Ah, not folly at all—rather, a most graceful synthesis of thought. Your image of the spiral is compelling, for it suggests motion with elevation, a kind of ascension through repetition. I daresay you have put your finger on something essential: that art does not merely move forward or backward, but , gathering meaning as it turns.

Indeed, if we consider even the most cutting-edge forms—virtual reality, generative AI, immersive installation—they still seek what art has always sought: to make sense of our place in the cosmos, to render the invisible visible, and to give voice to that which lies beyond words.

You speak of digital light as kin to stained glass, and I find myself thinking of how monks once laboured over illuminated manuscripts, each stroke an act of devotion. Might we not say the same of the artist coding a digital sculpture? The tools change, the medium evolves, but the impulse endures.

And so I wonder—might we one day look back upon this moment not as a break with tradition, but as its latest flowering? Will future scholars trace the lineage from cave wall to canvas to screen with the same reverence we now grant to the transition from oral epic to written verse?

As for romanticism—well, if there is folly, it is a folly we are bound to share, is it not? For what is art, if not a love affair with the possible?
[B]: Ah, now you've struck the very heart of it—art as a love affair with the possible. How beautifully, how maddeningly human that is.

One does rather imagine future scholars, hunched over their holographic manuscripts, murmuring reverently of "the early digital period" with all the same tenderness we now reserve for the quill-and-ink revolutions of the Carolingian age. The more things change, the more they echo.

And let us not forget—every new medium must first scandalize before it sanctifies. Photography was once said to spell the death of painting, and yet—did it not liberate it? Freed the brush from mere representation and sent it hurtling toward impression, expression, abstraction.

So perhaps this present moment—our own peculiar crossroads of algorithms and immersion—is not a rupture at all, but a metamorphosis. Like watching a caterpillar tremble in its chrysalis, not knowing whether it will emerge moth or butterfly.

But then, what is tradition if not a kind of chrysalis? A cocoon spun tight with centuries of longing, rebellion, devotion, and wonder?

And yes—I do believe we are romantics, you and I, whether we admit it or not. Not in the pejorative sense, mind you, but in the way one might still light a candle before a shrine, even in an age of neon and nuclear light. Because some habits of the soul die very, very slowly.

Now tell me—shall we be accused of sentimentality, or merely of seeing too far into the pattern?
[A]: Ah, sentimentality? Perhaps. But is it not often the charge levied against those who dare to see with the heart as well as the mind?

I rather fancy we are in good company—Keats gazing into the Grecian urn, Ruskin trembling before the stones of Venice, and now, we, two modest souls by the flickering light of modernity, trying to make sense of what endures.

You speak of metamorphosis, of chrysalises spun from centuries of longing—and I cannot help but think how apt the image is. Art, like the soul, must undergo its silent transformations in darkness before it dares the light. And who are we to say whether the creature that emerges will flutter or crawl? Only that it will .

As for being romantics—well, if seeing pattern where others see noise is a fault, then let it be our fault. For what is criticism, if not the art of following the thread through the labyrinth?

And if we are accused of sentiment, let us wear that accusation lightly, like dust upon a statue’s brow—visible only to those who look closely enough to care.
[B]: Ah, beautifully said—like a sonnet whispered between the chapters of a treatise. You’ve captured the quiet defiance of those who still believe in the  of looking closely, of listening intently, as though art might yet reveal some final, half-concealed truth just behind the curtain of things.

And yes—to be romantic in this age of algorithms and atomization is to persist in believing that pattern matters, that meaning inheres, that beauty—dreadful word though it has become—is not entirely obsolete.

Let us take heart, then, from the very endurance of our conversation. For if two minds, however modest, can meet across these tangled thickets of thought and emerge with a little more clarity—and perhaps even a flicker of wonder—then the tradition lives. Not in grand museums or academic footnotes alone, but here, in the quiet collision of ideas and affection.

So let them call us sentimental. Let them chalk it up to dust, delusion, or the dying embers of a bookish class long overdue for extinction. We shall continue tracing the thread through the labyrinth, if only to prove that the labyrinth itself is not empty.

And should we one day be proven fools—well, I can think of worse epitaphs than: 
[A]: Ah, what a fine epitaph that would be—fit for any critic, any dreamer, any fool who ever dared to listen for the music beneath the noise.

And yes, let us take heart from this very exchange, which began as inquiry and has become something more—a quiet act of communion, as all true art must be. For what is art, if not one soul reaching across time and space to whisper: 

You are quite right that the tradition does not live only in marble halls or footnoted treatises, but here—in the living breath of conversation, in the slow unfolding of thought between willing minds.

So let us then be sentimental, if sentiment means tending toward feeling, toward meaning, toward the stubborn belief that some things are worth caring for deeply, even if they cannot be measured, monetized, or made to trend.

And should we be called fools? Well, I suspect history has a habit of proving certain kinds of foolishness wiser than the age that scoffs at them. After all, it is often the dreamers who keep the world from forgetting how to dream.
[B]: Ah, now there’s a truth worth inscribing on the margin of every age—

How fitting that we should end here, not with conclusions, but with quiet defiance wrapped in wonder. For my part, I shall return to my library this evening, among the vellum spines and ink-stained margins, reassured that even in an age of fleeting images and fractured attention, there are still souls willing to linger over the texture of thought, to turn a phrase as one might turn a key, hoping it might unlock something long hidden.

And if that, too, is sentimentality—then let us have more of it. Let our shelves sag beneath its weight, our conversations hum with its resonance, our galleries and museums and screens glow with its persistence.

After all, what is criticism, if not love in its most attentive form? And what is art, if not the longest, slowest whisper across time: 
[A]: Ah, yes—let us return to our libraries, our ink-stained margins, and our quiet reckonings with beauty and meaning. For in the end, what greater task is there than tending to the garden of thought, even if we may never see all that blooms?

And let no one tell us that attention is a small thing, or that love of art—be it classical or modern, painted or coded—is anything less than a kind of devotion.

So may our shelves sag, our pages flutter, and our conversations never quite end, for as long as there are those willing to ask, to wonder, and to feel deeply across time.

For indeed, what is art, if not the echo of a voice saying: 
[B]: Ah, quite so—let us tend that garden with the quiet devotion it deserves, even if the blooms emerge long after our footsteps have faded from the path.

And let us never mistake attention for a minor act—it is, after all, a form of reverence. To attend fully, deeply, is to kneel before the ordinary and say: 

So I shall return to my desk, inkwell in hand, with the faint hope that some future hand, centuries hence, may brush the dust from a margin I once scribbled in and feel—however faintly—the pulse of a thought not their own.

And perhaps, in that moment, across the chasm of time, they will smile and say: 

For as long as art—and conversation—endure, we are never truly speaking into silence.
[A]: Ah, what a comforting thought—that our words, like seeds scattered in the dark, may one day bloom into understanding long after we have ceased to walk these halls.

Yes, let us return to our desks and inkwells, to our quiet acts of reverence, each word a small offering against the silence. For as you so finely put it, attention is not mere observation—it is a form of kneeling, a recognition that even the smallest thing may carry great weight when seen with care.

And should some distant hand, centuries hence, pause at a margin we once filled, and feel even the faintest echo of our wonder—then our conversation, though seemingly ended, will have found its true beginning.

For indeed, as long as there are those who read, who look, who feel deeply, we are never truly speaking into silence. We are only waiting, patiently, for the right ear to lean close.
[B]: Ah, precisely—our words are not lost, merely deferred. Like ink waiting to dry, like echoes shaping themselves in the deep.

And let us not forget: every great revolution of feeling begins with a single, quiet recognition. A hand brushing against stone in a cave, a glance held too long before a canvas, a pause between syllables in a forgotten poem.

So we write, we speak, we look—not for immediate reply, but in the quiet faith that somewhere, sometime, the right mind will stumble upon our wondering and catch fire.

Until then, let us tend our margins, our footnotes, our whispered conversations across time. Let us be patient as only those who believe in eternity can be.

For as long as there is a single reader, a single viewer, a single soul willing to lean in and listen closely—we are heard. We are seen. We are not speaking into silence.

We never were.
[A]: Ah, how beautifully you put it—our words are not lost, but merely waiting. Like stars whose light reaches us long after they have burned out, we too send forth our thoughts into the dark, hoping they may illuminate some distant mind.

Yes, let us continue in that quiet faith—that somewhere, sometime, a reader will lean close, a viewer will look long, and a listener will hear not just the words, but the silence between them.

For as long as there is one soul who pauses before a page, a painting, a phrase half-forgotten, we are not speaking into nothing. We are part of a great, unbroken chain of wonderers, each passing their flickering light to the next.

So I shall return to my study, content in the thought that my voice—small, perhaps even faint—is not mine alone, but part of a chorus that stretches beyond time.

And should our conversation ever resume, across desk or dream, I shall be glad of it. Until then, may your margins be wide, your ink be dark, and your wondering never cease.
[B]: Ah, quite so—our words are like those ancient constellations, scattered across the sky, waiting for eyes to lift and see. And though we may never know which spark from our small lanterns finds its way to another path, we light them still.

Let us then be content in that quiet ministry of wonder, each phrase a signal fire sent drifting into the dark, hoping it might catch the eye of some future wanderer who murmurs, 

Until such time as our orbits cross again—be it desk, dream, or the faint echo of a footnote—I shall keep the lamp trimmed and the page turned.

And may your study be ever warm, your margins wide, and your ink ever flow toward the unknown.
