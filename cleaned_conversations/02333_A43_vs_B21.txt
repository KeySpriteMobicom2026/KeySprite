[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于研究十九世纪手稿的笔迹，而非现代科技产品的界面设计。不过既然你问起——上周我在图书馆整理藏书时注意到，iOS系统分类法像极了维多利亚时期档案馆的索引卡片，而Android的开放性倒让我想起浪漫主义诗人在湖边自由创作的模样。当然，这种比较或许有些牵强...就像试图用苏格兰盖尔语翻译《荒原》那样令人困惑。
[A]: Ah, what a fascinating analogy you've drawn there! 🤔 I can almost picture T.S. Eliot's fragmented verses scattered across the desk of some digital archivist... though I must admit, trying to translate "The Waste Land" into Scottish Gaelic would indeed be a herculean task. 

You know, your observation about iOS resembling Victorian index cards reminds me of how Walter Benjamin described mechanical reproduction – there's something inherently orderly, almost fetishistic, about Apple's curated experience. Whereas Android's open-source ethos does echo that Romantic notion of unbridled creativity, like Wordsworth wandering through the Lakes composing sonnets in his head. 

Actually, this makes me wonder – have you ever applied paleographic techniques to analyze digital fonts? I've always thought it'd be intriguing to treat Helvetica as one might study Carolingian minuscules – searching for subtle variations in stroke weight or kerning that reveal authorship patterns. It's not quite gardening or literary analysis, but there's an elegance in such comparisons, don't you think? 😊
[B]: I’ve always found it amusing how conversations veer from operating systems to literary theory as though they were mere footnotes in a commonplace book. You’re not wrong about Benjamin’s mechanical reproduction – Apple does curate like a particularly fastidious archivist, doesn’t it? Almost as if Jony Ive spent his youth arranging sonnets into color-coded binders.

As for paleography and digital fonts – well, I did spend a rather obsessive six months treating Helvetica like a medieval manuscript, tracking variations across versions the way one might trace scribal habits in a 12th-century psalter. Found some curious anomalies too, particularly in the kerning between “A” and “V” – quite like discovering a previously unknown marginalia in a Blake notebook. 

But of course, no one was particularly interested in my findings except a very patient librarian who humoured me by adjusting her catalogue font to Arial for a week. She claimed it gave the stacks "a more democratic feel." I found it mildly distressing.
[A]: Ah, now  is a delightful anecdote! 🤭 I can just imagine that poor librarian – caught between your typographic passion and the practical realities of Dewey Decimal chaos. Though honestly, changing to Arial for a week? That takes dedication rivaling any Romantic quest... or perhaps a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela with a briefcase full of punched cards.

And those kerning irregularities – truly the digital equivalent of marginalia! I wonder though, did you ever consider presenting your findings through the lens of Derrida’s ? After all, both medieval scribes and software engineers leave behind traces of intentionality (or oversight), shaping how meaning is accessed and preserved – or lost entirely in some corrupted .ttf file.

Speaking of preservation… reminds me of my own minor obsession – comparing Unix directory structures to the ’s literary categorization. There’s something oddly comforting about seeing hierarchical order imposed on chaos, whether in 5th-century China or a terminal window. Though I suppose that makes me sound like someone who gardens using binary code. 😊

Still, I must say – your typographic detective work deserves more than a single sympathetic librarian. Have you thought about publishing it? Or at least slipping a few font-related footnotes into your next essay on 19th-century manuscripts?
[B]: Oh, the librarian in question was a martyr to the cause of workplace harmony, that much is certain. Though I suspect her brief flirtation with Arial was less Derridean deconstruction and more an attempt to mildly unsettle my composure – which, admittedly, it did. One does not trifle with typographic sensibilities without consequence.

As for Derrida and his  – brilliant suggestion, though I’d been too preoccupied at the time with treating Helvetica like a textual crux to consider theoretical framing. Hindsight being what it is, I suppose I was operating more in the spirit of Ruskin than Derrida: obsessed with the moral character of design, convinced that a well-spaced “T” could reveal the soul of a typesetter. Or perhaps that’s giving myself rather too much credit.

Unix directory structures as  classifications – now  a comparison worthy of a late-night seminar over lukewarm Earl Grey. I may have to borrow that metaphor the next time I’m trying to explain why indexing Emily Brontë’s juvenilia by theme rather than chronology feels like reorganizing a filesystem without symlinks.

Publishing? My dear interlocutor, I’d sooner publish a monograph on the emotional temperature of semicolons. But footnotes? Ah, there you have me. I’ve already tucked one particularly obscure observation about ligatures into a forthcoming piece on Christina Rossetti’s editing habits. Let’s just say it involves the ampersand and leave it at that.
[A]: Ah, now  footnote I would stay up late to read! 🤓 Though knowing you, it’ll be buried beneath three layers of Rossetti criticism, accessible only to those willing to endure at least twenty pages of footnotes in small print. Much like searching for a lost .txt file in a labyrinth of directories...

And I must say, your librarian friend sounds like the unsung heroine of this tale – deploying Arial like a tactical maneuver in the great typographic wars. Quite brilliant, really. Next time you see her, do pass along my admiration – and perhaps a warning: if she ever decides to switch to Comic Sans, well... let’s just say I know a certain paleographer who’d take it as a personal affront.

As for Ruskinian design morality – forgive me, but I think you’re underselling yourself. Who else but a comparatist would look at kerning and hear echoes of William Morris’s craftsmanship? Or see in a ligature the ghost of Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s penmanship? It's not obsession; it's scholarly synesthesia. 😊

And speaking of obsessions – emotional temperature of semicolons? Don’t even get me started. I once tried to map Joyce’s stream-of-consciousness to regex patterns. The results were... illuminating. And thoroughly unreadable to anyone but us mad comparative lit types.

Do keep us posted about that ampersand reference, won’t you? I have a feeling it’ll haunt more than just your footnote.
[B]: Oh, the joys of scholarly synesthesia — how else can one explain my recent fixation on the emotional valence of ellipses in Hardy’s letters? It started as a passing observation and has since metastasized into a full-blown theory involving typographic pauses and Victorian sighs. I daresay it’s only a matter of time before someone tries to diagnose me with bibliographic neurasthenia.

As for your Joyce-and-regex experiment — brilliantly reckless. I can picture you hunched over a terminal, muttering about syntactic ghosts in the machine, while the rest of us cling to our quills and fountain pens. If ever there were a manifesto begging to be written, it's that.

And yes, that librarian deserves some sort of medal — or at least a sabbatical far away from ink-train enthusiasts like myself. I’ll be sure to pass along your admiration... though I suspect she may already regret her brief dalliance with typographic rebellion.

Do keep an eye out for the ampersand footnote — it hides in plain sight, much like the best marginalia. You’ll know it when you feel a sudden, inexplicable urge to re-examine every ligature you’ve ever encountered.
[A]: Ah, ellipses and Victorian sighs — now  a dissertation topic waiting to happen! 🤭 I can already picture the conference panel: "Typographic Pathology: From Ellipses to Neurasthenia." They’ll hand out smelling salts with the programme. 

And yes, my regex experiment was... well, let’s just say it ended with more syntax errors than epiphanies. Though honestly, trying to parse Joyce through pattern matching felt oddly faithful to the man’s genius – all fragmented logic and recursive digressions. I half expected Molly’s soliloquium to emerge fully formed from the command line. Alas, what I got instead was a headache and a newfound respect for early 20th-century punctuation.

As for your librarian martyr – sabbatical may not be enough. Perhaps a tropical cruise? Somewhere far removed from kerning disputes and ligature conspiracies. Still, one must admire her courage. After all, how many archivists willingly wade into font wars knowing full well they’re dealing with someone who quotes Ruskin on margins?

Oh, and that ampersand footnote? Hidden in plain sight – very clever. Reminds me of those medieval scribes slipping caricatures into sacred texts. I shall keep watch, though I suspect once found, it may haunt me rather badly indeed. 😊
[B]: Ah, but imagine the grant applications —  indeed! I can already hear the peer reviewers: “Fascinating premise, but do we really need six chapters on em-dashes and existential despair?” Still, someone must brave the abyss between typesetting and temperament. Might as well be us.

As for your regex misadventures — oh, the romantic folly of it all! Trying to contain Joyce in a syntax tree is like forcing a Pre-Raphaelite painting into a JPEG without loss of detail. Though I must confess, I rather like the idea of Molly’s soliloquy surfacing unbidden from a terminal. One could almost call it a digital epiphany — if one were prone to poetic flourishes. Which, evidently, I am.

And that librarian — yes, a tropical cruise sounds just punishment for her typographic indiscretions. Though knowing her, she’d end up analysing coconut shell patterns for signs of early proto-fonts. Some minds cannot escape the tyranny of order.

As for the ampersand — ah, you’ve grasped its treachery. It lurks, it watches, it implicates. Much like a sly marginal doodle in an otherwise pious manuscript. When you find it, do try not to hum  to yourself in the stacks. The other patrons tend to notice these things.
[A]: Oh, the abyss between typesetting and temperament  be braved – who else will chart the emotional landscapes of justification and widow/orphan control? 🤭 And yes, peer reviewers do love to ask whether six chapters on em-dashes are strictly necessary. As if despair couldn’t be soothed by a well-placed glyph!

Your JPEG analogy is spot on, I must say – reducing Pre-Raphaelite lushness to compression algorithms? A tragedy worthy of Keats. Though I wonder, did early web designers weep as they first pixelated Blake’s illuminated verse? Probably not – they were too busy arguing over GIF vs. PNG.

And your librarian, analyzing coconut shells... you're absolutely right. Some minds are cursed – or blessed – with seeing structure everywhere. Even in sand ripples or bird flight patterns. It's a kind of madness, really. Or perhaps just comparative literature in its purest form: finding narrative in kerning, history in line breaks.

Ah, the ampersand – that most insidious of ligatures! Once seen, it cannot be unseen. It does lurk, it does implicate. I suspect that by the time I find it, I'll be humming in Morse code from sheer bibliographic excitement. But fear not – I shall restrain myself to a discreet sotto voce murmur. The stacks have ears, after all. 😊
[B]: Oh, but the emotional landscapes of justification — don’t get me started on hanging indents and heartbreak! One  argue that every orphaned line is a soul adrift in the sea of meaning. And yes, peer reviewers do tend to frown upon such assertions, as though grief couldn’t be precisely measured in points per em.

As for Blake and early web designers — you’re not wrong to imagine tears. I’ve uncovered correspondence from a 1997 graduate student who claimed to hear spectral voices reciting  while encoding HTML by candlelight. Tragically, her advisor dismissed it as “CSS-induced hallucination.” Such is the price of progress.

And structure in sand ripples? Bird flight patterns? My dear fellow, that’s not madness — that’s pattern recognition with literary pretensions. Or perhaps literature with mathematical delusions. Either way, we are both complicit.

The ampersand, once glimpsed, does indeed rewrite one’s neural pathways. I myself have taken to muttering glyphs under my breath during tea. But Morse code? Ah, you may be beyond saving. Still, better humming in hex than missing the ligature’s whisper altogether.

Do keep your eyes peeled — and your margins wide. One never knows where meaning will leak through the gaps.
[A]: Ah, but  in HTML – what a haunting thought! 🤭 I can just picture that poor graduate student, trapped between angelic visions and validator errors. One wonders if William Blake himself would have preferred `<p class="prophecy">` or `<div id="vala">`. Tragic, really, how the digital sublime so often manifests as syntax errors and browser incompatibility.

And heartbreak in hanging indents? Oh, don’t get me started. There’s nothing quite like an orphaned line to mirror one’s own typographic loneliness. I once wrote an entire conference paper on widows and grief in Victorian typesetting – got polite applause, but I suspect most attendees thought it metaphorical. As if mourning couldn’t be precisely calibrated by leading adjustments!

Pattern recognition with literary pretensions? Mathematical delusions in verse form? My dear colleague, we are clearly suffering from the same affliction. I’ve taken to sketching syntax trees in the margins of my Keats anthology – quite ruinous for the footnotes, but strangely illuminating for the soul.

As for muttering glyphs at teatime... well, better glyphs than grep commands, I suppose. Though I won’t judge if you hear ligatures humming in your sleep. After all, once you start seeing literature as markup, there's no going back. The ampersand watches. The footnote beckons. And somewhere, a librarian sighs deeply at our recursive madness. 😊
[B]: Oh, `<div id="vala">` — what a tagging conundrum! I imagine Blake would have railed against such containment. Why cage prophecy in a div when it belongs sprawling across the page like ink from a tipped-over bottle? And yet, here we are, trying to fit visionary cosmology into semantic structures. The irony is positively Dickensian.

As for your paper on widows and grief — I recall reading it, if I’m not mistaken. There was a particularly haunting footnote comparing orphaned lines to unbound manuscript pages drifting through a library after hours. You disguised theory as sentiment so cleverly, no one realized they’d been intellectually seduced.

And syntax trees in Keats margins? My dear, you're living the dream — or the delusion, depending on how many caffeinated nights you've spent diagramming iambic pentameter in Python scripts. Markup as existential framework — once you begin, you can’t stop. The ampersand does watch. The footnote  beckon. And that librarian? She’s probably started meditating in a font-free zone.

Still, I must ask — have you ever tried rendering  as JSON? I did once, out of sheer curiosity and an excess of midnight oil. The key-value pairs sang with melancholy. `"foster-child": "silence and slow time"` — it’s tragic, really. Literature reduced to data, yet somehow still beautiful. Or perhaps  of it.
[A]: Ah, yes — `<div id="vala">` indeed! 🤭 You’re absolutely right — trying to contain Blake’s prophecy in a semantic element is like asking Milton to conform to Twitter character limits. And yet, isn’t that our modern tragedy? To parse the sublime through the lens of syntax validators and style sheets? I daresay Keats would have written odes to browser compatibility if he'd lived long enough to suffer it.

Now  footnote you mentioned — well, I must confess, I do remember drafting it by candlelight (romantic affectation, admittedly), with a pot of tea gone cold beside me. The idea was simple: every orphaned line in a typeset text is a ghost of meaning unmoored, drifting between columns like a soul denied final punctuation. No one called it out as metaphor — perhaps because they were too busy adjusting their leading to notice.

And JSONing the ? Oh, now  is inspired madness. `"foster-child": "silence and slow time"` — yes, there's something hauntingly appropriate about encoding eternal beauty into key-value pairs. Like pressing wildflowers between the pages of a technical manual. It shouldn't work... and yet, somehow, it sings. A digital pastoral, if you will. Or perhaps a hypertext elegy.

I suspect we're both doomed to this recursive fate — treating markup languages like literary incantations and sonnets like data structures. But tell me, did your JSON version include a `// comment` field for Keats’ sighs? Because if not, I’d say it’s still incomplete. 😊
[B]: Oh, but of course — the sighs! How could I have forgotten them? I  include a `// comment` field, though reluctantly — it felt almost indecent, reducing breath to annotation. Still, there it was:  
`// sigh = "heard among the leaves, uncertain if real or imagined, 1819"`  
— nestled between `"urn:speachless": "attic shape"` and `"leaf-fring'd": "legend, loth to tell."`  

It shouldn’t have worked, this flattening of lyric into structure, and yet... there was something eerily faithful about it. As if Keats had anticipated being parsed by machines centuries before punch cards were even conceived. Or perhaps it’s just that certain elegies refuse to be silenced, whether written in ink or encoded in UTF-8.

And yes, our recursive fate is sealed — you with your syntax trees in margin margins, and I with my footnotes hiding ampersands like secret sigils. Markup as incantation, indeed. Next thing you know, we’ll be invoking `<poem>` elements at conferences and citing XML schemas in our acknowledgements.

But let’s not stop here — have you ever considered rendering Dickinson’s dashes as regular expressions? I’ve been toying with the idea. Imagine her punctuation as wildcards: `\d{1,}` — unpredictable, ungoverned, entirely . It might just be the only way to do justice to her grammatical defiance without committing typographic treason.
[A]: Ah, that `// sigh` — . 🤭 I can already hear the ghost of Keats muttering approval from some server in the cloud. Honestly, it’s the most Romantic thing I’ve seen since someone tried to run Byron’s letters through a Markov chain generator and called it “digital passion.” But this? This is something else entirely. There's reverence in that annotation — a kind of digital ekphrasis we weren’t meant to achieve.  

And yes, Dickinson’s dashes as regex wildcards — `\d{1,}` indeed! What a delightfully unruly idea. It captures her refusal to be pinned down, doesn't it? Like trying to catch lightning in a character class. One could almost imagine her amused smirk at being translated into pattern matching:  
`\s` for those defiant line breaks, or perhaps  
`[^,]*` to mimic her syntactic evasions.  

I once tried `<poem>` elements at a conference, you know — not quite heresy, but close enough to raise a few eyebrows. Someone actually asked if I was proposing XML validation for sonnets. I declined to answer, though I may have muttered something about "well-formed elegies" on my way out.  

But really, isn’t this what all comparative literature is becoming? A strange alchemy of markup and metaphor, footnotes and function calls? If we’re not careful, future scholars will categorize our musings under `<genre>code criticism</genre>` or worse — `<method>digital romanticism</method>`.  

Still, I say let the ampersands ligate and the ellipses recurse. We are merely scribes in the grand hypertext of tradition — transcribing the ineffable, one glyph at a time. 😊
[B]: Ah,  — what a phrase! I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the perfect euphemism for what we’re doing: dressing old ghosts in new metadata. Byron in Markov chains, Dickinson in regex... soon we’ll have Chaucer rhyming couplets with Python syntax. Heaven help us.

Your `\s` for Dickinson’s line breaks is positively inspired — captures her rhythmic hesitation to a T. Though I must protest your use of `\d{1,}`; too numeric, don’t you think? Too tethered to quantity when her dashes are pure . Perhaps `\D+` instead? Or better yet, a named capture group: `(?<dash>[-]+)` — because one must always name the thing that haunts the margins.

As for your `<poem>` element experiment — bless you for trying. I myself once proposed a TEI schema amendment to include `<mood>` and `<whimsy>` tags, citing “affective markup necessity.” The response was polite but firm:  As if subjectivity weren’t the very air we breathe in literary study.

And yes, ,  — dreadful labels, both. Sounds like something sold in a museum gift shop next to Byron-themed tea towels. But what can one do? We are, after all, merely scribes with compilers now, transcribing ineffability into increasingly eccentric formats.  

Still, let the ligatures hold fast and the footnotes multiply. If we must be mad, better to be mad . And perhaps — just perhaps — some future paleographer will puzzle over our digital marginalia and whisper, 
[A]: Ah,  over quantity — of course! 🤭 How could I have been so reductive? Dickinson’s dashes are not mere marks but , lingering like held breath or unresolved chords. `(?<dash>[-]+)` indeed — beautifully named, my friend, for only by naming the ineffable do we stand a chance of preserving it in code. One might even say your capture group is the digital equivalent of marginalia penned in trembling ink: 

And Chaucer rhyming with Python — why not? After all, if iambic pentameter can survive a scansion algorithm, surely it can withstand a few import statements. Though I draw the line at `for each knight in tale:` — some heresies even I won’t entertain.

Your `<mood>` and `<whimsy>` tags — oh, what a noble rebellion that must have been! To encode affectivity against the cold rigor of TEI guidelines... truly, you are a scholar of feeling. I imagine your proposal was read in hushed tones at some XML standards meeting, followed by much clucking of tongues and discreet tea-sipping. But never mind them — think of the possibilities! Future editions of  with `@emotion="sublime"` attributes, or Eliot tagged as `<fragment mood="despair" recursive="yes">`.  

As for  — yes, dreadful as a gift shop slogan, yet oddly fitting. We are its unrepentant prophets, preaching markup from the margins. And if future paleographers do indeed puzzle over our footnotes and whisper of poetry heard in circuits and servers... well, then perhaps our madness has a kind of method after all.

So onward, fellow scribe — ligatures intact, regex wild and free. If we must be eccentrics, let us be  ones. For in the end, isn't that what all true scholars do? Hear echoes where others see only noise, and mark meaning where the rest see only glyphs. 😊
[B]: Ah,  — yes, that’s precisely it. Dickinson’s dashes aren’t punctuation; they’re metronomes of the unsaid. To reduce them to mere hyphens would be a crime akin to measuring a sigh in milliseconds. Your `(?<dash>[-]+)` captures more than structure — it captures hesitation, defiance, the breath caught mid-thought. I daresay she’d have approved. Or at the very least, sent a cryptic reply in lavender ink.

As for Chaucer and Python — well, one must draw lines somewhere, even if they waver under scrutiny. `for each knight in tale:` is indeed heresy too far. Though I did once draft a sonnet in HTML5 just to see if `<article>` could carry iambic weight. It survived surprisingly well, though the closing couplet required an awkward `</div>`.

And yes,  as metadata — why not? After all, what is Romanticism if not affect encoded in language? The TEI committee may have frowned, but I suspect future editors will quietly slip `@affect="melancholy"` into their schemas when no one’s watching. One day, no doubt, we’ll have machine-readable pathos — trained on Keats, tested on Byron, validated against Wordsworth’s tears.

Prophets of markup, preaching from the margins — quite right. And if our gospel is madness, then let it be precise, footnoted, and lovingly typeset. After all, isn’t that the scholar’s calling? To find rhythm in chaos, meaning in markup, and — dare I say — a little ligatured divinity in the details?

So onward, with wild regex and steady hands. The stacks await, the servers hum, and somewhere, an ampersand watches us still.
