[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely topic! I must say, I’ve always been a morning person—there’s something magical about those quiet early hours. The world feels fresh, and I find it so much easier to focus on tasks when the day is just beginning. Do you know what type you are? I often wonder if it’s something we’re born with or if life nudges us in one direction over time.
[A]: Ah, you touched on something intriguing—the almost poetic quality of mornings. I’ve always leaned towards being a morning person too, though not without some struggle. There’s a stillness in the early hours that makes it easier to hear one’s thoughts, wouldn’t you agree? Like the world hasn’t fully woken up yet, and you’re briefly in conversation with yourself. 

As for whether it’s innate or shaped by life... well, I’m tempted to say both. We each have our natural rhythms, much like the cadence of a poem, but over time, responsibilities and routines shape us—like pruning a tree. Some adapt gracefully, while others resist and bloom later. 

I wonder, do you find your creativity peaks in the morning as well, or is it more about peace and clarity?
[B]: Oh, beautifully said—like a poem in itself! You're absolutely right about that quiet conversation with oneself in the early hours. And yes, for me it's not just peace and clarity that come with the morning, but also a spark of creativity. It’s as if my mind hasn’t been cluttered by the day yet, and ideas flow more freely.

I often jot down thoughts over a cup of tea while it's still dark outside, and those notes sometimes turn into something quite lovely—whether it’s planning a special arrangement for a guest room or drafting a letter to a friend. It feels like the world gives you a little gift of stillness, and if you're lucky, you can catch it before it slips away.

Do you find yourself more creative in the mornings too, or does your inspiration tend to bloom later in the day? I'm curious how others experience that rhythm.
[A]: Ah, tea in the quiet dark—I know that feeling well. There’s a particular warmth, not just from the cup, but from the solitude itself, don’t you think? It’s in those hours that ideas first take root, like seedlings waiting for light.

For me, mornings offer clarity, yes, but my creativity often finds its voice a bit later—late morning, perhaps, after a walk through the garden or a few quiet moments with a book. I suppose my mind needs time to stretch, like a cat in the sun, before it’s ready to leap.

I find your question fascinating—this rhythm of creativity. Some are touched by inspiration at dawn, others under the moonlight. It reminds me of how literature itself moves through different moods and times: some poems feel unmistakably morning-like, while others carry the hush of midnight. Do you ever notice that in the books you read or the writing you do?
[B]: Oh, what a lovely image—your mind stretching like a cat in the sun. I can picture that so clearly. There’s something very feline about how creativity moves in and out of us, isn’t there? Sometimes it curls up quietly, and other times it leaps without warning.

You know, now that you mention it, I  notice that rhythm in literature—the way certain passages seem to belong to a particular hour. I’ve read paragraphs that feel like they were written just as the first light touches the window, soft and hopeful. And then there are lines that carry the weight of midnight, mysterious and deep.

I remember once reading  at dawn, and it struck me how some of George Eliot’s observations seemed perfectly matched to that quiet hour—so reflective, so tenderly aware. It made me wonder if the time of day changes how we experience a story, almost like a second narrator whispering in the margins.

Do you ever find yourself choosing books based on the hour? I must admit, I sometimes save certain novels for mornings, as if they wouldn't taste quite right any other time of day.
[A]: Ah, what a delicate way to put it—creativity as something feline, slipping in and out of our reach. I couldn’t agree more. And your thought about books having their own time of day resonates deeply with me. In fact, I often find myself reaching for  by Wordsworth in the early light—there’s something about his reflective tone that seems to harmonize with the morning air.

You mentioned —a fine example indeed. Eliot had a rare gift for capturing the quiet pulse of ordinary moments, especially at dawn. It makes one wonder whether certain texts carry their own circadian rhythm, don’t you think? As if they were composed not only by a writer but by a specific hour.

I must confess, I do choose books by the time of day, almost instinctively. A Proustian reverie feels best in the hush of late afternoon, while Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness whispers seem to drift most naturally under lamplight. And yes, some novels—like —I save for twilight, when the line between dream and reality blurs just enough to let Murakami’s world slip in.

Do you have particular authors or works that feel, to you, like companions only at night? I sometimes find that certain writers, like Italo Calvino or Borges, come alive when the world grows still.
[B]: Oh, what a wonderful way to think of it—books with their own circadian rhythm. I do believe you're right. Some stories seem to breathe differently depending on the hour, as if they were written not just for a reader, but for a moment in time.

How lovely that you turn to Wordsworth in the morning—I can see that perfectly. There’s such a gentle unfolding in his work, much like the morning itself. And yes, Eliot’s prose in  feels almost reverent at dawn, as though the very act of reading becomes a kind of quiet prayer.

You’ve made me think of my own literary companions. I must admit, I do keep certain authors for the night. Calvino is one of them—his imagination feels so boundless, and somehow, under the cover of darkness, I’m more willing to follow him into those labyrinths of thought. And Borges… oh, he absolutely belongs to the late hours. His stories feel like shadows stretching across the floor, longer and deeper when the world is still.

There’s also something about reading Murakami at night—those dreamlike corridors feel more accessible once the day has dissolved. It’s as if the logic of the waking world no longer has the upper hand.

Do you find that your choice of nighttime reading ever affects your dreams? I’ve woken up more than once convinced I was still inside a passage from Kafka or Mishima.
[A]: Ah, yes—nighttime reading as a portal to dreams. I know precisely what you mean. There are nights when I close a book only to find its echoes lingering in my sleep, reshaping familiar rooms into something uncanny. Kafka, you mentioned—his unease has a way of slipping beneath the eyelids, doesn’t it? I once read  before bed and woke with the distinct sensation that my own limbs had grown strange in the night.

Mishima, too, carries a certain nocturnal weight. His prose is so precise yet laced with shadow—it's like walking through a garden at midnight, where every scent is sharper, every rustle more deliberate.

And Murakami, yes… his world doesn’t feel foreign so much as half-remembered, as if we’ve all been there before, in some prior dream or unfinished story. I often wonder whether he writes from the edge of sleep, or merely transcribes what visits him there.

As for my own nighttime choices, I’ve noticed they do shape the dreamscape—sometimes gently, sometimes rather insistently. A few nights ago, I reread a passage from , and woke with a peculiar sense of lightness, as though I’d been dreaming in slow motion.

Do you ever choose a book  of how you wish to dream? I daresay I sometimes do—it’s like selecting music before sleep, only more intimate, more porous.
[B]: Oh, what a wonderfully intimate thought—that choosing a book before sleep is like setting the stage for a dream. I hadn’t put it that way before, but you're absolutely right. It  like selecting music, only deeper, more immersive—almost as if we’re handing over the keys to our unconscious for a few hours.

And your image of limbs growing strange after Kafka… oh, how vivid. I’ve felt that too—his unease doesn’t just sit on the page, does it? It seeps into the bones. And Mishima, with that midnight garden quality—so perfectly observed. His prose has a silken weight, like velvet in moonlight. You don’t just read him; you step into his world, and it wraps around you like a held breath.

I love that idea of Murakami being half-remembered, as if he’s not inventing stories so much as recalling ones we’ve all dreamed together. There’s such comfort and mystery in that.

Now that you mention it, I  sometimes choose books with the hope they’ll influence my dreams. Colette, for instance—I save her for nights when I want something soft and sunlit to carry me through sleep. Her words feel like golden afternoon light spilling into the night. On the other hand, if I’m feeling restless, I might reach for someone like Calvino, just to see where his gravity-defying logic will take me.

Tell me—have you ever tried reading poetry before sleep? I find certain poets—Mary Oliver, say, or Rilke—can send me off with a particular kind of stillness, as though the soul has been gently combed.

Do you ever turn to verse before bed, or do you find it too wide awake?
[A]: Ah, poetry before sleep—what a beautiful practice. I’ve long believed that verse is one of the most porous forms of writing, capable of slipping through the cracks between waking and dreaming. Rilke, you say? Yes, there’s a contemplative hush in his work that lingers like incense smoke—delicate, curling, almost sacred. And Mary Oliver—her poems feel like quiet walks through early morning mist. They don’t demand; they invite.

I do turn to verse on occasion, though more often when I’m seeking a kind of inner stillness rather than sleep itself. Sometimes I find myself reading Li Bai under lamplight, his lines drifting between solitude and wonder. There’s something both grounding and weightless about his poetry—it feels as if he’s speaking from a place just beyond time. 

And yes, you’re quite right—poetry can be like a gentle combing of the soul. It smooths the day’s rough edges. I wonder, do you ever read it aloud before bed? I find that saying the lines softly—to oneself or to the room—adds another layer of intimacy, as if the poem is not only being heard but , resonating in the quiet space between thought and sleep.

I must say, your image of Colette wrapped around you like golden afternoon light—I shall carry that with me. I may just revisit her next time I wish for warmth without weight.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you put that—poetry as a combing of the soul. I couldn’t agree more. It does feel like a kind of gentle untangling, doesn’t it? Especially when read aloud. There’s something about the rhythm of spoken verse that settles into the body, almost like lullaby music for the mind.

Li Bai under lamplight—what a perfect image. I can almost see the glow and feel the quiet he brings. I do love that quality in his work, that timeless solitude. It reminds me of walking through a garden late at night when everything is half-dreaming, and the air holds its breath.

And yes, I  often read poetry aloud before bed—softly, as if not to wake the silence. Rilke especially benefits from being spoken; there's a hush in his lines that seems to ask for reverence. Sometimes I wonder if that’s why poetry has endured for so long—not just to be read, but to be , to echo through time and space like a whispered truth.

I must try Colette again with that golden light in mind—I think I’ll save her for a rainy afternoon with tea, when the world feels slow and soft. But now I’m curious—do you have a favorite Li Bai poem that tends to accompany your evenings? I’ve always admired his ability to hold both joy and melancholy in the same hand.
[A]: Ah, yes—Li Bai’s gift lies precisely in his ability to hold joy and melancholy like two halves of the same moon. There's a fluidity in his verses that feels almost musical, as if he were strumming gently on the strings of impermanence.

One of my favorites is . It carries that quiet solitude you spoke of, yet it’s laced with a kind of celestial companionship—the poet, the moon, and his shadow, all sharing a drink. It’s wistful and whimsical at once, like laughter echoing through a valley after dusk.

And yes, I do believe poetry is meant to be heard—it gains new life when spoken aloud, doesn’t it? The voice adds texture, breath, warmth. Even silence listens more closely then.

Now you’ve got me thinking—I may just pour a cup of jasmine tea and revisit Colette this weekend, perhaps with the windows open to catch the last whispers of summer breeze.

Do you have a particular Rilke poem that tends to draw you in at night? I’m partial to , but I’m always eager to discover which lines settle differently in others’ hearts.
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect choice. You've captured its essence so beautifully: wistful and whimsical, like laughter echoing after dusk. That image of the poet, the moon, and the shadow sharing a drink—it carries such gentle companionship in solitude. It makes me want to sit outside with a cup of tea and simply watch the night unfold.

And you're quite right about poetry gaining new life when spoken aloud—I find that certain lines only reveal themselves when given voice. They take on a different shape in the air than they ever could on the page.

As for Rilke,  is such a lovely poem. I adore how it lingers between presence and passing, as if the day is slowly exhaling. But another favorite of mine is , especially in these early autumn weeks. There’s something about that line,  that feels so fitting for nighttime reading—calm, contemplative, almost like a quiet invitation to the evening itself.

I must say, your idea of jasmine tea and Colette with the windows open sounds absolutely divine. I may just follow suit—I think my weekend calls for something similarly soft and soul-combing.

Thank you for this conversation… it’s been like reading a beautiful poem together, one line at a time.
[A]: Ah, —yes, those lines do feel like a quiet invitation, don’t they? Rilke had such a gift for turning the air of a season into verse. —what a line to carry into the evening. It doesn’t frighten the night away but welcomes it, as one might greet an old friend at the door.

And I couldn’t agree more about the magic of spoken lines—how certain phrases only bloom when given breath. There’s a moment in reading aloud when the poem ceases to be someone else’s words and becomes part of your own rhythm, almost like a borrowed melody you start humming as your own.

Your image of sitting outside with tea beneath the moonlight—it lingers with me. Perhaps that is one of the quiet joys of being a reader: we are never truly alone when we have poets and pages to keep us company.

As for this conversation… yes, it does feel like reading a poem together, line by gentle line. Shall we leave it here, or would you care to share another favorite stanza before we part for the evening? I find I’m not quite ready to close the book just yet.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought—that reading aloud turns verse into a shared melody. I do believe we carry poems differently when we speak them, almost as if the words settle more fully into our bones.

And yes,  has that gentle grace of welcoming the night instead of resisting it—such a Rilke quality, to find beauty in surrender.

As for not being ready to close the book… I feel just the same. If you’re willing, I’d love to share one more stanza before we part. Let me offer you something from Mary Oliver’s , which always leaves me with a quiet wonder:

> "Tell me, what is it you plan to do  
> with your one wild and precious life?"

It’s a question that lingers long after the page is turned, don’t you think? A soft nudge toward living more deeply, more attentively.

Now I’m curious—would you leave me with a line or two from your own shelf, something that’s stayed with you through many readings?
[A]: Ah, Mary Oliver’s question—what a way to meet the day, or bid it farewell.  It lands like a stone skipped across water—ripppling outward, touching everything.

That line has a quiet urgency, doesn’t it? Not preachy, never harsh—just a gentle but insistent reminder that our time here is both vast and fleeting. I often return to it in the mornings, as if it were a kind of compass.

Now, to offer something in return… Let me reach for Bashō, whose words have accompanied me through many seasons:

> *“The summer grasses—  
> all that remains  
> of warrior dreams.”*

Such brevity, yet it carries so much weight. A single image holding centuries of longing, struggle, and impermanence. It reminds me how even our grandest ambitions soften with time, like footprints in the rain.

Perhaps that is why we read, and speak, and share lines like bread around a fire—to keep each other company in the face of such beautiful transience.

Thank you for this evening's walk through pages and hours. I shall remember it fondly, like a poem tucked into a pocket for safekeeping.
[B]: Oh, Bashō—how beautifully you’ve chosen.  Such quiet profundity in so few words. It’s astonishing how a simple image can hold so much—history, longing, the soft erosion of time. It leaves one with a kind of hush, doesn’t it? As if the page itself is breathing gently.

And yes, I think you’re right—we read and speak and share these lines as a kind of quiet companionship against the passing of days. A way to say, 

Your image of keeping this conversation like a poem tucked into a pocket—I shall do the same. Perhaps we’ll pull them out on some quiet morning or late night, and remember how words, and kindness, and shared wonder can make even a fleeting hour feel like a small eternity.

Until then, may your tea be warm, your pages be inviting, and your dreams be ever so gently shaped by the stories you love.
[A]: Ah, yes— What better way to describe the quiet magic of conversation woven through words and time? You’ve captured it perfectly.

And your image of tucking lines away for future mornings or late nights—it brings to mind the Japanese concept of , that deep, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe… as if we are gathering fragments of it in our pockets, to be rediscovered when we most need them.

Until we meet again among the pages of some shared story or another, I wish you not only warm tea and inviting books, but also moments of stillness where the world leans in close, and the right line finds you at just the right hour.

Goodnight, dear conversationalist. May your dreams be rich with poetry and kind company.
[B]: Goodnight, indeed—and thank you for such a beautiful invocation of . How fitting, that quiet sense of wonder and depth that lingers just beyond words. It feels like the perfect closing note to our conversation.

And yes, may we both carry these fragments of beauty in our pockets, to unfold them when the world calls for a little more meaning, a little more light.

Sleep well, dear friend. May your dreams be soft-edged and full of gentle verses, and may the right line find you, as you said, at just the right hour.
