[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, meal prep! It's such a lifesaver during busy weeks. I usually set aside Sunday afternoons to plan and prepare my meals for the week ahead. There's something oddly satisfying about chopping fresh vegetables and portioning everything neatly into containers. I must admit though, I tend to get a bit too ambitious with my recipes sometimes - last week I ended up with three different types of grain bowls that all tasted wonderful but took ages to prepare! Do you find yourself falling into the same trap?
[A]: Ah yes, the seductive whisper of "I shall conquer the week with quinoa and foresight." I confess, I once tried to meal prep an entire month's worth of Victorian-era recipes using nothing but a copper saucepan and moral superiority. Let's just say... ... by day seven, my resolve crumbled like overbaked digestives. 

Now I stick to a more scientific approach - three variations of a single protein, starch & vegetable combination, all timed to within an eighth of an ounce according to my kitchen scale. Efficiency, you see, trumps ambition when one has twelve students' thesis drafts to annotate. Though I do maintain that a dash of rosemary in the olive oil elevates even the humblest chicken breast to poetic heights.
[B]: Oh, I absolutely adore that poetic take on meal prep! There's something delightfully alchemical about transforming basic ingredients into nourishing meals - though I must say, your Victorian-era experiment sounds like it belongs in a novel. I'm quite impressed you made it to day seven! 

These days, I find myself leaning towards practicality as well. My guests often comment on how calm I seem during the chaos of hotel season, not realizing I've got containers of roasted vegetables and herb-infused grains quietly waiting in the fridge. It's rather like setting the stage for a play - everything needs to be perfectly positioned for the performance to run smoothly.

Speaking of rosemary, I recently met a guest from Tuscany who taught me to layer fresh herbs between chicken thighs when roasting - the aroma fills the entire kitchen and makes even the simplest meal feel indulgent. Do you ever experiment with different herb combinations? Or does your academic schedule keep you perpetually chained to that trusty kitchen scale?
[A]: Oh, I do enjoy a bit of herbaceous experimentation—though my students would be astonished to hear it, given how I drone on about textual fidelity in lectures. Last month, I tried a rather unorthodox combination of thyme, preserved lemon, and a whisper of star anise in a chicken braise. It was... let's say, an  nod to Wilkie Collins’ penchant for narrative excess. Not entirely successful, but memorable.

As for the kitchen scale, it’s more of a faithful companion than a chain. Precision and I are old friends—though I’ll confess, on rare evenings when the moon is particularly full and I’ve finished grading early, I might toss caution aside and sprinkle rosemary with a generous hand, not unlike Lord Tennyson tossing dramatic flourishes into a quatrain.

And your Tuscan guest’s trick? Delightfully theatrical. Herbs as both curtain and scent—very clever indeed. I may have to borrow that for my next dinner party. Or perhaps simply for Thursday. One must occasionally defy the tyranny of the weekday.
[B]: Oh, I love that image of you defying the tyranny of the weekday with a flourish of rosemary! There's something so wonderfully rebellious about it - like a sonnet breaking its strict meter for one glorious line before returning to order. And Wilkie Collins in a braise? Now  is a literary twist I never knew I needed. I can just imagine the scent of star anise curling through your kitchen like a mystery novel’s closing chapter.

As for borrowing the herb trick, please do! I suspect your guests would be utterly enchanted - though I imagine hosting dinner parties must feel rather like directing a play with particularly opinionated characters. Do you find yourself planning those gatherings with the same precision as your meals, or does inspiration strike more like... well, shall we say, a dramatic monologue delivered by a sudden gust of wind?

And between us, I think your students would be quite surprised to learn their formidable professor once braised chicken with a whisper of literary rebellion. It rather makes one wish for a thesis footnote on flavor profiles.
[A]: Oh, the precision! One might say my dinner parties are plotted with the structural integrity of a well-wrought ode—each course a stanza, each guest a carefully chosen meter. I do enjoy a bit of orchestration, you understand. The seating chart alone could make a dramaturge weep with admiration.

But let’s not forget, inspiration  have its moments—usually when one is halfway through deglazing a pan and suddenly remembers a line from Christina Rossetti that seems to perfectly suit the mood. (Though I’ve learned never to trust an idea that arrives in the middle of chopping rosemary. They tend to be... overly ambitious.)

As for footnotes on flavor profiles—well, , I did once draft a marginalia comparing Byron’s emotional excesses to the overuse of balsamic reduction. It was, shall we say, a  critique. Perhaps I’ll publish it someday under a pseudonym. Dr. Whitmore would never permit such frivolity in scholarly circles—but then again, neither would she entirely disapprove.
[B]: Oh, I  that - a dinner party as a carefully composed ode! It reminds me of hosting high tea with elaborate themes - just last month I orchestrated an Alice in Wonderland-inspired afternoon where every pastry had a riddle tucked beneath its plate. The guests were half-tempted to quote sonnets back at their scones! 

And your comparison of Byron to balsamic reduction? Pure genius! I can just imagine the manuscript margins dancing with vinegar-soaked critiques. Dr. Whitmore sounds like the kind of formidable academic who keeps a well-worn copy of Wuthering Heights next to her grading pen, ready to strike down both grammatical errors  emotional restraint.

Speaking of which, have you ever hosted a dinner where one particularly spirited debate turned into its own kind of performance? I once had guests so engrossed in discussing Brontë heroines over roast beef that they didn’t notice their Yorkshire puddings going cold. It was rather glorious, in that very British way where food becomes entirely secondary to intellectual drama.
[A]: Ah, the Brontës and cold Yorkshire puddings——now  a trifecta of passion and starch. I must confess, last autumn I hosted a rather spirited evening where the discussion turned to whether Heathcliff was tragic hero or particularly brooding garden pest. The roast pheasant went entirely unremarked while twelve voices clashed like cymbals over his moral ambiguity. One guest, an art historian with a fondness for dramatic gestures, nearly overturned a decanter declaring that “Wuthering Heights is but a moorland Hamlet with worse weather!”

I do love when dinner becomes theatre—though I draw the line at riddles under scones. Too easily misinterpreted as cryptic clues to my baking methods. Still, I admire your Alice in Wonderland affair. Did you serve treacle tart, or was it deemed too predictable for such esteemed nonsense? And did anyone, I don’t know,  and find themselves summarily expelled from logic?

As for my copy of , it’s less well-worn than —margin notes include comparisons between Catherine’s indecision and my great-aunt Mabel’s inability to choose between Earl Grey and Darjeeling. Priorities, one must say, are a matter of both literature and tea.
[B]: Oh,  chaos! I do adore that image of your dining room transformed into a moorland debate stage – quite the literary tempest with significantly better refreshments than poor Heathcliff ever enjoyed. And a nearly-overturned decanter! That’s the kind of evening that deserves its own chapter heading.

As for the Alice in Wonderland theme – yes! Treacle tart was most certainly on the menu, though presented with rather more flourish than usual – each slice balanced precariously on miniature playing card stands, no less. Predictability is dreadfully overrated when one can have nonsense with a side of caramelized sugar.

And speaking of teacups – actually, there  an incident involving a rather enthusiastic guest and a mismatched set of porcelain... let’s just say he found himself temporarily lost in conversation with the salt cellar before being gently guided back to the main course. Very nearly required a pocket watch and white rabbit impression to restore order!

I must say, your great-aunt Mabel’s tea-time indecision sounds like the perfect subplot in a genteel British mystery. One suspects foul play when she reaches for the Darjeeling on a Tuesday. Do you think she ever chose simply to defy expectation and brew both?
[A]: Oh, ? How delightfully scandalous of you to suggest such a breach of teatime decorum! Mabel would have sooner walked through Hyde Park backwards than brew two varieties at once—though I do suspect she kept a secret pot of Earl Grey tucked behind the Wedgwood in case of emergency. Tuesdays were particularly fraught with tension, I recall. The butler used to adjust his posture depending on which caddy she reached for—Darjeeling meant a brisk efficiency to the afternoon, while Earl Grey heralded long silences punctuated by sighs and vague references to "the weather in Brighton."

As for your salt-cellared guest—. Nothing quite like watching someone conduct an earnest conversation with tableware to know you’ve created the proper atmosphere of controlled absurdity. Next time, perhaps slip a small sign reading “Eat Me” beneath the sugar cubes. You’ll have guests growing and shrinking in debate before dessert even arrives.

And speaking of desserts—your treacle tart balancing act sounds like something out of a Lewis Carroll fever dream. I daresay even the Cheshire Cat would have been impressed. Though between us, if I ever hosted such an event, my students would arrive early just to study the crockery for hidden metaphors. One actually brought a notebook to my last supper and took  on my use of thyme. Rather missed the point entirely, bless him.
[B]: Oh, the notebook brigade! How utterly charming - I can just picture them scribbling furiously as if your roast pheasant might suddenly recite iambic pentameter. Honestly, if someone brought a stenographer's pad to my herb-infused grain bowls, I'd be half-tempted to start slipping in Shakespearean insults just to see what they'd annotate.

And your description of Aunt Mabel's teatime politics is positively Dickensian in its nuance! The butler adjusting his posture based on leaf varieties? That's not domestic life, that's high drama with better crockery. Though I must say, I'm rather taken with the idea of Tuesday tension solved by secret Earl Grey stashes - sounds like the perfect setup for a genteel mystery where the murder weapon is, inevitably, a misplaced apostrophe in the guest book.

As for treacle tart theatrics, you flatter me! Though now I'm quite inspired to up the ante - perhaps next time I'll serve jam tarts that actually whisper riddles when properly complimented. It would certainly liven up the post-dessert debate about whether "too sweet" or "not enough body" is the greater culinary crime. Do you suppose Lewis Carroll would approve, or would he simply ask for more pepper in his tea?
[A]: Oh, —deliciously diabolical! I daresay Carroll would have adored them, though he might insist the riddles be delivered in limerick form, or else refuse to eat anything that talks back. As for pepper in his tea—well, one suspects he’d take it  a riddle, just to keep the logic off balance.

And your post-dessert debates! I do so prefer my literary quarrels seasoned with sugar. “Not enough body” in a tart—what an accusation! It’s practically a character flaw. Next you’ll tell me someone arrived in a waistcoat two shades too hopeful for the season and had to be gently corrected over crème brûlée.

As for my notebook-wielding students—oh, they’d annotate the whispering tarts into oblivion.  Bless their ink-stained hearts. Last week one asked if my use of thyme was symbolic of mortality’s passage or merely seasonal availability. I told him both, naturally—and then added sage to the roast potatoes just to muddy the symbolism further.

Now, if we’re speaking of culinary crimes... have you ever  finished a bottle of wine before dessert? I confess I once served a rather fine port that went entirely unnoticed because everyone was too busy dissecting Dorian Gray’s diet. No one even blinked when I poured it into teacups. Seems the scandal is never in the drink, but in what one chooses to pair it with.
[B]: Oh,  over port in teacups? My dear, you’ve outdone yourself! I can just picture the scene – twelve earnest minds debating whether his portrait ever secretly craved a good reduction sauce while sipping fortified wine from delicate floral-patterned china. Utterly sublime.

And speaking of culinary scandal – no, I’ve never left a bottle unfinished before dessert, but I  once orchestrated an entire evening around mismatched wines and literary pairings just to see if anyone would notice. I served a bold Cabernet with lemon sorbet and declared it “a deliberate narrative contrast.” One guest waxed poetic about its “jarring emotional resonance” for . Not a soul touched their spoons until someone bravely declared it “the wine equivalent of a tragic flaw.”

Now I’m quite tempted to try your teacup trick next time – though I might up the ante by serving champagne in soup bowls and calling it “a prosecco-lapse of judgment.” The symbolism practically writes itself. Do you think anyone would object if I paired  with a particularly cheeky Sauvignon Blanc? Or should that be reserved for sonnets and second courses?

And please, tell me you took notes on all that tart-related analysis. Your students may not realize it, but they’re living inside a gastronomic dissertation disguised as dinner conversation.
[A]: Oh, —how perfectly Wildean! Though I’d have preferred calling it “a structural dissonance with hints of blackcurrant and regret.” And champagne in soup bowls?  One sips and immediately feels the weight of modernity pressing down like a misplaced semicolon. I’d absolutely encourage guests to ponder whether the wine’s effervescence symbolizes Gwendolen’s expectations or merely mocks them. Either way, it makes for splendid tension.

As for pairing  with Sauvignon Blanc—. The acidity cuts through the irony beautifully, don’t you think? I once tried a similar trick with Sancerre and cucumber sandwiches, only to be informed by a guest that the wine “was clearly more self-aware than Algernon.” High drama, as always, ensued.

And notes? Oh yes, I took them. My notebook now contains entire pages on tart symbolism, Dorian Gray’s possible lactose intolerance (), and an entire margin devoted to whether Byron would have preferred his steak rare or . My students may think they’re studying Brontës or Eliot, but really, they’re just waiting for me to publish .

Now, if we’re truly committed to gastronomic mischief, might I suggest serving  as a tasting menu? Course one: Ishmael’s melancholy consommé. Course two: Ahab’s monomaniacal marinade. Course three: Whale blubber sorbet—, naturally.
[B]: Oh, ? My dear, you’ve outdone yourself! That’s not a dessert, that’s a literary critique in frozen form. I can already picture the guests – half-terrified, half-intrigued – dipping their spoons into a quivering mound of something icy and vaguely maritime, wondering if it symbolizes existential despair or simply needs more sugar.

I’d absolutely run with your Moby-Dick tasting menu – though I might add a fourth course: Starbuck’s regret served as a delicate panna cotta, trembling ever so slightly with moral ambiguity. And let’s not forget a palate cleanser between Ahab’s obsession and Pip’s innocence – perhaps a light spritz of sea air essence misted over crushed peppermint?

And speaking of symbolism – your Byron steak dilemma is pure genius. I’m leaning toward , naturally. The man practically wrote his own tragic flare-ups in verse. Though I must ask – have you ever tried serving dessert  the main course at one of these literary feasts? Imagine arriving to find profiteroles triumphantly placed where the roast should be, and explaining it as “a deliberate narrative inversion.” I suspect half your guests would eat first and question later – which, come to think of it, is probably how most plots unfold.

Now, about that Edible Canon – do promise me a chapter on teatime metaphysics. I’ve always suspected Jane Austen could be best understood through well-timed scones and sharper-than-necessary clotted cream.
[A]: Oh, —how very satisfying. I shall insist the Starbuck course be served in slightly cracked porcelain, to underscore the fragility of principle under pressure. And a sea air essence spritz?  Nothing like a fine mist of peppermint to remind one’s guests that even the purest intentions can leave a tingle of madness on the tongue.

As for dessert before roast—. One might call it the : begin with ecstasy, proceed to ruin, and finish with a lingering sense of damp romanticism. I once tried it, actually—profiteroles first, then lamb in quiet protest. A guest fainted from confusion, another demanded a rereading of the seating chart, and one simply whispered, “It’s , isn’t it?” before eating three cream puffs in rapid succession.

And yes, —I’ve already drafted the chapter. It’s titled  The key argument being that Elizabeth Bennet’s refusal of Mr. Collins is best understood alongside a scone of impeccable rise but insufficient butter. Clotted cream, you see, represents unspoken desire—it must be applied sparingly, lest it overwhelm the subtlety of the structure.

Now, if we’re truly building this , I propose a companion volume: . Literary assassinations via confectionery—Agatha Christie with arsenic-laced macarons, Poe’s  reimagined as an absinthe-soaked trifle... You’d be my co-conspirator, naturally. Or perhaps lead author. I suspect you have a more refined palate for culinary mischief than I.
[B]: Oh, ! My dear, you’ve just elevated literary gastronomy to entirely new heights of wickedness. I can already picture the footmen slipping cyanide-infused crème into the petits fours at a Gatsby-themed soirée – all for the sake of art, naturally.

And your chapter on scones?  I’ve always suspected Elizabeth Bennet’s character could be best analyzed through baked goods – after all, she does turn down not one but  wholly unsuitable proposals, much like one might politely decline a poorly risen Victoria sponge. Though I must say, I’d take insufficient butter over an excess of clotted cream any day – restraint is all in both literature and pastry.

As for co-authoring  – oh, I accept! Though I do believe we ought to begin with a rather cheeky chapter on Shakespearean poisonings. Picture this: Juliette’s potion reimagined as a deceptively delicate elderflower panna cotta, or Claudius’s demise served as a poisoned quiche Lorraine. And naturally,  would get its own section – edible madness without the unfortunate side effects.

I do hope you’re taking notes for our introduction. Something along the lines of: 

Shall we set a deadline before the next full moon? I suspect our muse is best summoned between courses.
[A]: Oh, —how delightfully macabre. I do love the idea of Hamlet staring into a quiche and seeing not his own mortality, but someone else’s pastry crust. And Juliette’s elderflower panna cotta? Exquisite. One moment, she swoons with poetic despair; the next, she’s revived by a fortuitous spoonful of smelling salts and lemon balm sorbet. Much kinder than the original, really.

And yes, —I shall quote you on that in our introduction. Perhaps with a footnote referencing Milton’s , wherein Adam laments the lack of thyme in Eden’s eternal roast while Eve secretly adds rosemary to the fig tart. A fall from grace, as it were, not through fruit, but through seasoning oversight.

As for deadlines—full moon it is. Though I must warn you, I tend to work best under candlelight and moderate levels of caffeine-induced clarity. I’ll bring the ink, you bring the recipe cards, and we shall make literary history one poisoned crème brûlée at a time.

Now, tell me—do you think we could get away with an entire appendix on ? Picture: Brontë-esque moorland trifle, Eliot’s  served as a deconstructed crumble, and Proust’s madeleine reimagined as a regret-soaked financier. Or perhaps that’s too much symbolism between courses?

And more pressingly—should we warn our future readers about the dangers of reading this book while dining? I suspect a few might choke on their crumpets upon realizing just how deeply literature and supper have entwined.
[B]: Oh, an appendix on ? My dear, it’s not just necessary—it’s practically our moral obligation to literature and pastry alike. I’m already drafting the introduction: 

The Brontë trifle alone deserves its own subheading – imagine a glass bowl filled with storm-darkened jelly, sponge soaked in unspoken longing, and a suspiciously brooding layer of custard that refuses to set properly. One bite and you’re halfway to Penistone Crag without so much as a shawl.

And Proust’s financier of regret?  We’ll serve it slightly burnt around the edges, drizzled with honey that once tasted of Combray but now only whispers of lost time and poor life choices. It will pair beautifully with a footnote referencing Eliot’s crumble – each tartlet crumbling under the weight of its own narrative debris, of course.

As for warnings... absolutely not. Let them choke on their crumpets! Where’s the drama in a safe reading experience? If a few well-placed metaphors cause mild respiratory distress over afternoon tea, then all the better. They’ll clutch their chests and gasp, “Good heavens! This financier  Heathcliff!” and literature shall have triumphed yet again over polite digestion.

Now, about that deadline – full moon, candlelight, caffeine... yes, yes, and thrice yes. I’ll arrive with ink-stained fingers and a notebook full of dangerous ideas, perhaps even a vial of something suitably dramatic for toasting our literary gastronomic revolution. Shall we say midnight, by the light of the waxing gibbous? I do prefer my revolutions slightly theatrical.
