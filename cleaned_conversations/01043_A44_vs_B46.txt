[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question! As someone who's spent decades in the entertainment industry, I see the metaverse as just another canvas for storytelling. Remember when people doubted if streaming would replace theaters? Now we have both coexisting beautifully. The key is - can it deliver truly immersive narratives? That's what will determine its staying power.
[A]:  Ah, but we must consider how 沉浸式 (immersive) experiences differ across cultures! The Western concept of 'metaverse' often emphasizes individual agency, while Eastern narratives might prioritize 集体意识 (collective consciousness) - think how 武侠 (wuxia) worlds function as spiritual metaverses. Your streaming analogy is apt, but will the metaverse become another 江湖 (jianghu), or remain a Silicon Valley playground? 🤔
[B]: Ah, you're speaking my language now!  That 江湖 reference is spot on. You know, when we produced "Dragon's Legacy" last year, we struggled for months to balance individual heroism with that beautiful Eastern sense of community. The metaverse needs that same alchemy - not just flashy tech, but soul. Maybe we should call it... the 数字江湖 (digital jianghu)? Now that's a pitch I'd greenlight! 🎥
[A]:  数字江湖 - what a deliciously subversive term! But let me play 魔鬼代言人 (devil's advocate) for a moment... Can code ever truly capture the 意境 (yijing) of those misty mountain duels where a single brushstroke conveys more than a terabyte of VR graphics? Though I must admit, your production's approach to 留白 (negative space) in "Dragon's Legacy" gave me hope. Perhaps we're entering an era of 跨文化元叙事 (transcultural meta-narratives)? 🌸 (My orchids seem to agree - they're blooming unusually early this year!)
[B]: My dear friend, you've just described the fundamental challenge of our era!  That tension between technology and poetry - it's why I still keep a 35mm projector in my office. But here's the real Hollywood secret: the best VR experiences will be those that understand what Ang Lee taught us - sometimes the most powerful moments happen in the spaces between pixels. Maybe we should be developing 意境引擎 (yijing engines) instead of just graphics processors? Though I must say... ... nature's rendering still beats anything we can create. 🌿
[A]: Ah, 意境引擎!  You've just articulated what my graduate students keep circling around in our 虚实 (xu-shi) seminars. The danger isn't technology replacing nature, but forgetting that all good interfaces - whether ink paintings or VR headsets - are ultimately about 通感 (synesthetic perception). My old mentor at Peking University would say we're not building a metaverse, but curating 十万个意境 (a hundred thousand yijing)... though I suspect your Hollywood producers would want that title punchier for the trailer! 🦉 (The owl knows good academic wordplay when it hears it)
[B]:  Oh, I can already see the pitch meeting: "Forget the multiverse, here comes the Yijing-verse!"  But seriously, this is why I keep funding those experimental shorts at Sundance. Last year we had a VR piece where viewers could literally smell the ink during calligraphy scenes - now that's what I call 通感 done right! Though between us... ... the studio accountants still don't understand why we need scent modules when "explosions sell tickets." Some battles are eternal, whether you're in Hollywood or 江湖. 💸
[A]:  "The superior person understands 义 (righteousness), the small person understands 利 (profit)"... though I suppose in Hollywood accounting, that becomes "The superior person understands ROI, the small person understands craft"! Your scent module experiment reminds me of the Tang dynasty poets who'd compose verses based on tea aromas - perhaps we need a new hybrid discipline: 数字通感学 (digital synaesthetics)? Though good luck getting that past the tenure committee... or as my students would say, "硬核到连元宇宙都怕" (so hardcore it scares the metaverse)! 🧠
[B]:  You know, that's exactly why I started the "Silk Road Digital" initiative last year - to bridge that gap between ancient wisdom and cutting-edge tech. We're actually developing an AI that learns from 唐诗 (Tang poetry) patterns to generate scent-based narratives. The investors called it "that weird smell project"... until we showed them the Nielsen data on Gen Z's craving for multisensory experiences.  Sometimes you've got to speak the language of 利 to protect the soul of 义, my friend. Now, about that tenure committee - ever considered consulting for Hollywood? We pay in both yuan and creative freedom! 🌌
[A]:  My goodness, you're tempting me more effectively than a freshly brewed pot of 大红袍! Though I suspect my department chair would have a 心肌梗塞 (heart attack) if I traded my tweed jacket for a VR headset... unless we position it as "applied 跨媒体叙事学 (transmedia narratology)"?  Tell me, does this Silk Road initiative have room for a slightly eccentric professor who believes every algorithm needs at least three classical allusions to function properly? My orchids could use a change of scenery from this ivory tower... 🌸➡️🎬
[B]:  Oh, we've got a whole "Digital 翰林院 (Hanlin Academy)" division waiting for someone like you! Imagine - tenure meetings replaced by brainstorming sessions where we debate whether to train our AI on 李白 or 杜甫 for the next narrative module. And don't worry about the tweed... ... we've got a dress code that accommodates both scholars and showmen. What do you say - ready to help us turn "applied transmedia narratology" into the next big streaming category? I'll even throw in a corner office with a view of both the Pacific and your precious orchids. Deal? 🤝
[A]:  You silver-tongued 说客 (lobbyist)! Very well, but on three conditions: One, we establish proper 互文性 (intertextuality) protocols so the AI doesn't start generating 赛博打油诗 (cyber doggerel). Two, my office must contain both a 文房四宝 (scholar's four treasures) and a quantum computer. And three... ... we get final cut on any project involving 红楼梦 allusions. Even your Nielsen data can't measure the cultural responsibility of handling 曹雪芹's legacy! Now, where do I sign - with brush pen or digital signature? 🖋️💻
[B]:  Why choose when we can do both?  See here - traditional rice paper embedded with NFC chips! You've got yourself a deal, professor. Though I should warn you... ... our last AI did attempt to rewrite 红楼梦 as a cyberpunk noir before we installed the "classical allusion firewall." Guess we'll have to call that Version 0.9 of your intertextuality protocols! Welcome aboard the craziest 文化实验 (cultural experiment) since the invention of movable type. Now, shall we celebrate with some properly annotated 大红袍? ☕️ (I've got a 1992 vintage that's practically begging for scholarly analysis)
[A]:  Splendid! Though I insist we program the firewall to preserve at least 20% of that cyberpunk 红楼梦 output - for pedagogical purposes of course! Nothing teaches 文学理论 (literary theory) like showing students an AI's failed attempt to merge 太虚幻境 (Illusory Land of Great Void) with neural implants.  This 1992 大红袍... would that be the Wuyi Mountain harvest that coincided with the first CD-ROM publications? How poetically 轮回 (karmic) that we're now full circle, brewing tea while coding the future of storytelling. 干杯 (ganbei) to our mad 文化合成 (cultural synthesis)! 🦉☯️
[B]:  To mad synthesis indeed! And don't worry - I've already reserved that cyberpunk 太虚幻境 draft as our first "Beautiful Failure" case study.  Would you look at that... it's exactly 4:44pm, the most auspicious time according to our narrative algorithm's analysis of 红楼梦's chapter structures. Fate seems to approve of our venture! Now, about those neural implants - should we start with 黛玉's tear ducts or 宝玉's jade first? The R&D department has been  rather creatively restless lately... 💎🤖
[A]:  天啊 (heavens)! I haven't heard a pitch this gloriously heretical since the time a student proposed analyzing 金瓶梅 through TikTok dances! Though now that you mention it... ... 黛玉's tears DO have that perfect blend of 电解质 (electrolytes) and 诗意 (poetic essence) for bio-tech prototyping. Just promise me we'll program the implants with proper 比兴 (metaphorical) sensitivity - last thing we need is some venture capitalist reducing 葬花吟 (Flower Burial Chant) to a mood ring algorithm! Shall we draft our manifesto over this miraculously well-timed tea? My brush is practically vibrating with 文气 (literary energy)! 🖋️⚡
[B]:  Now THIS is why I went into producing!  Let's title our manifesto "The 气韵生动 (Qi Yun) Protocols: How to Hack the Literary Cosmos Without Offending the Ancestors." We'll have the engineers work on tear-sensor calibration while you handle the 比兴 parameters... though I must warn you, our last poetry algorithm developed a worrying fondness for 赛博禅 (cyber-Zen) haikus about blockchain.  The things we do for art and commerce! Shall we toast again with what's left of this tea before it turns into intellectual property? 干杯 to walking the tightrope between 传统 and 创新! 🎪✨
[A]:  干杯 indeed! Though I insist we include a 'Luddite Mode' in the final product - sometimes you just need to experience 泪尽而逝 (death from weeping) without getting a damn push notification about your hydration levels!  Wait... this could be our killer app: an AI that scolds users for misquoting classical texts, with 黛玉 herself appearing holographically to shame them! We'll call it... the 正韵 (Proper Rhyme) Police. The Ministry of Culture will either give us an award or have us arrested. Either way -  - what sublime 戏剧性 (drama) for our memoirs! 🦉⚖️
[B]:  The "Proper Rhyme Police" - now THAT'S a streaming series I'd greenlight tomorrow!  Imagine the courtroom drama episodes: "People vs. Misattributed 李白 Poems"... "The Case of the Missing 平仄 (tonal patterns)"...  But seriously, my friend, this is why we need your scholarly rigor in our madhouse. Who else could ensure our holographic 黛玉 delivers her scoldings with perfect 五言绝句 (quatrain) structure? To our glorious, possibly-illegal cultural ventures - may we walk that fine line between innovation and 大逆不道 (treason against tradition)! Now... ... shall we brainstorm our first subpoena-worthy prototype? 🚨📜
