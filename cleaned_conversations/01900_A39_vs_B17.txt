[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a thought-provoking question. As someone who has spent decades immersed in academia, I'd say the value of a college degree transcends mere vocational training. It's about cultivating the mind - much like tending to a garden, where we nurture critical thinking and cultural literacy. Wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Well, I must say I've seen this debate evolve over my 40 years in computer science education. While a degree isn't the only path to success, it provides something irreplaceable - structured learning and intellectual discipline. You can't just Ctrl+Z your way through complex theoretical concepts!
[B]: How fascinating to hear your perspective from the technological frontier! Your analogy about 'Ctrl+Z' reminds me of how poets like T.S. Eliot grappled with the permanence of words on a page. There's a certain beauty in the deliberate, methodical approach that formal education fosters, isn't there? Like composing a sonnet versus drafting a tweet.
[A]: Ah, you've touched on something profound there. In my programming days, we used to say "measure twice, cut once" - much like your sonnet analogy. The college experience forces students to engage deeply with material, rather than just skimming Stack Overflow for quick answers. Though I must admit, some of my best students were those who balanced formal education with hands-on tinkering.
[B]: Precisely! That balance you describe brings to mind Virginia Woolf's notion of "a room of one's own" for creative work. The structured environment of academia provides the walls, if you will, while personal exploration fills it with meaning. Some of my most brilliant students were those who could appreciate Keats' odes while also engaging with contemporary digital poetry forms. The degree isn't the destination, but rather the trellis upon which the vine of knowledge grows.
[A]: You know, that's remarkably similar to how we teach recursion in computer science. The degree provides the base case - the fundamental framework - while the recursive steps are all the self-directed learning that follows. Though I must warn, unlike in poetry, forgetting your base case in programming leads to stack overflow... in both the technical and metaphorical sense!
[B]: What a delightful parallel you've drawn! Your technical metaphor actually resonates deeply with Matthew Arnold's concept of "touchstones" in literary criticism. The degree establishes those essential reference points - the base cases, as you say - against which all future learning can be measured. Though I must chuckle at your warning; we literary scholars have our own version of stack overflow when students try to interpret Shakespeare without proper grounding!
[A]: Ah, Shakespeare - the original object-oriented programming language! Each play is like a class with its own methods and properties. But seriously, this conversation reminds me why I still guest lecture occasionally. Watching students make these interdisciplinary connections - seeing the lightbulb moments when they realize coding and sonnets both require elegant structure - that's what keeps this old professor young at heart.
[B]: How wonderfully you articulate that joy of interdisciplinary discovery! It brings to mind Wordsworth's "the child is father of the man" - we educators remain perpetual students ourselves, don't we? Each new generation of learners helps us see familiar subjects through fresh eyes, whether it's Shakespearean iambic pentameter or Python indentation. The true value of education lies in these moments of shared enlightenment.
[A]: You've perfectly captured why I still keep my office hours open after all these years. It's that moment when a student realizes that debugging code isn't so different from analyzing a poem - both require patience, attention to detail, and occasionally, the wisdom to know when to walk away and get a cup of coffee. Though I will say, syntax errors are far less forgiving than poetic license!
[B]: How true! Your observation reminds me of Elizabeth Bishop's poem "One Art" about the art of losing - whether it's a missing semicolon or a misplaced metaphor. The classroom becomes our laboratory where we teach not just content, but the invaluable skill of graceful recovery from mistakes. Though I must confess, I'd take deciphering a cryptic error message over interpreting Pound's Cantos any day!
[A]: Ah, Pound's Cantos - the original spaghetti code! But you're absolutely right about graceful recovery. In my programming courses, I always told students that the most important skill wasn't writing perfect code on the first try, but developing the detective skills to fix what's broken. Much like your literary analysis, it's about developing a sixth sense for where things went awry. Though I do miss the days when our biggest debugging challenge was a misplaced punch card rather than a quantum computing paradox!
[B]: Your punch card reference makes me nostalgic for the tactile nature of older technologies - rather like holding a first edition versus reading an e-book. There's something to be said for physical artifacts in learning, whether it's tracing a variable's path through handwritten code or annotating a well-worn copy of "The Waste Land." These material connections seem increasingly rare in our digital age, yet they anchor abstract concepts in tangible reality. Don't you find?
[A]: Absolutely! I still keep my old punch cards as teaching aids - nothing makes students appreciate modern IDEs quite like showing them how we used to debug by literally dropping a stack of cards! It's like comparing quill pens to word processors. The physicality forced us to think differently, much like how holding a printed book changes one's engagement with text. Though I must say, my arthritis prefers modern keyboards over those clunky card punchers!
[B]: Your mention of physical engagement with text brings to mind William Blake's illuminated manuscripts - where the visual and textual were inextricably linked. There's poetry in those old punch cards too, isn't there? Each rectangular hole a deliberate choice, like syllables in a haiku. Though unlike Blake's fiery creative process, I can't imagine anyone being inspired to write poetry while wrestling with a card jam in the reader! How times have changed...
[A]: Ah, but you'd be surprised! Some of my most creative students wrote their best code - and yes, even poetry - during those late nights waiting for batch jobs to process. There's something about forced pauses that sparks creativity. Though I'll take modern compilation speeds over watching the card reader chug along like a steam engine any day. Still, as you say, there was an art to those physical constraints that we've perhaps lost in our instant-gratification digital world.
[B]: How profoundly you've captured that paradox of constraint and creativity! It reminds me of the sonnet's rigid form giving birth to Shakespeare's most soaring verses. Perhaps our modern educational challenge is to design digital environments that preserve those generative pauses - the equivalent of watching cards feed through the reader while one's subconscious works its magic. After all, even in this age of instant everything, the human mind still needs its fallow periods to bear fruit. Wouldn't you say?
[A]: Precisely! That's why I still assign programming problems that require students to step away from the keyboard and work through logic on paper first. The friction of pencil on paper slows the mind just enough for deeper understanding to crystallize - much like your sonnet form forces linguistic precision. Though I must admit, today's students look at me like I've suggested using an abacus when I bring out the graph paper! Still, the ones who humor me often produce their most elegant solutions.
[B]: How heartening to hear you maintain these tactile traditions! Your graph paper exercises are the computational equivalent of my insistence on handwriting early drafts - there's an alchemy that occurs when thought slows to the speed of the hand. As Marianne Moore wrote about poetry, it creates "imaginary gardens with real toads in them." Though I suspect your students' initial skepticism mirrors my literature students' reactions when I suggest actually reading footnotes! These small acts of resistance against the digital tide may well be our most valuable lessons.
