[A]: HeyÔºåÂÖ≥‰∫é'‰Ω†ËßâÂæóremote workÂíåoffice workÂì™‰∏™Êõ¥productiveÔºü'Ëøô‰∏™ËØùÈ¢òÔºå‰Ω†ÊÄé‰πàÊÉ≥ÁöÑÔºü
[B]: Hmm, that's an interesting question. I think productivity really depends on the individual and their work style. Some people thrive in a structured office environment where there's more face-to-face interaction & accountability. Others find remote work more efficient because they can create their own ideal workspace and avoid office distractions~ 

From a psychological perspective, autonomy plays a big role here. When people have control over their work environment, it often boosts motivation. But let's not forget about social presence theory - humans are wired for connection. Too much isolation can lead to decreased engagement. 

I've seen studies showing hybrid models might offer the best of both worlds. What's your experience? Do you feel more focused working from home or in the office? ü§î
[A]: Yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot lately. You know, as someone who spends most of his time in front of computers writing code or designing blockchain architectures, I find myself preferring remote work for deep focus tasks. The ability to control my environment - adjusting lighting, temperature, and especially having access to my carefully calibrated coffee setup - makes a big difference in maintaining flow states.

But there's definitely something special about office environments when it comes to brainstorming sessions or complex problem-solving discussions. Last week we had a particularly challenging issue with smart contract interactions on a cross-chain bridge we're developing. It took us hours trying to debug through video calls, but once we got everyone together in the office whiteboard room, we cracked it in 45 minutes.

I've noticed though that my productivity patterns change depending on task complexity. Simple coding tasks? Home is great. But when we're architecting multi-layer consensus mechanisms or dealing with Byzantine fault tolerance scenarios, the office just feels more conducive to those deep thinking sessions.

What's fascinating is how different team members adapt. Our junior developers seem to thrive with remote work for routine tasks but often benefit from in-person mentorship sessions. And our QA lead? She swears by her "distraction-free" home setup but secretly misses the watercooler chats. Have you noticed similar patterns in your team?
[B]: That's such a fascinating observation! You've touched on something really important - the  of work environments. I see similar patterns in my research team. For routine tasks like data analysis or literature reviews, remote work offers that "flow-friendly" environment with fewer interruptions. But when we hit complex conceptual roadblocks or need to develop new theoretical frameworks, being together in person sparks those serendipitous connections.

I love how you described the office as "conducive to deep thinking sessions" - it reminds me of Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory combined with distributed cognition. When multiple minds are physically co-located, there's this beautiful cognitive synergy that emerges from shared attention spaces and embodied interactions. The whiteboard becomes more than just a tool - it's a collective thinking space where ideas materialize through gestures, sketches, and spontaneous annotations.

Your junior developers' experience aligns perfectly with Vygotsky's zone of proximal development too. Remote work gives them space to consolidate their skills independently, while face-to-face mentorship creates those crucial scaffolding moments for advancement.

You know what's interesting? I've noticed our team's QA specialist has developed this hybrid ritual - she works remotely but schedules daily 15-minute "watercooler walks" via video chat. It's her way of recreating those informal interactions. I wonder if your team would be open to experimenting with similar micro-moments of connection? ü§î
[A]: Actually, that sounds like something we could definitely explore. You know, I‚Äôve been thinking lately that the key might not be in choosing between remote or office work, but in  them ‚Äì almost like designing a protocol with specific functions for each environment.

For instance, we‚Äôve started treating our office days like "deep work sprints" reserved specifically for architecture discussions, system design debates, and those hard-to-debug consensus edge cases. Remote days, on the other hand, are more about execution ‚Äì coding, testing, documentation. It‚Äôs kind of like separating the compute layer from the consensus layer in a blockchain stack.

Your idea about micro-moments of connection really resonates. We tried something similar last quarter where every morning started with a 10-minute ‚Äúnon-technical sync‚Äù ‚Äì no laptops, just cameras-on casual chat about anything except work. At first, the team was skeptical ‚Äì you could feel the awkwardness through the screen ‚Äì but after a few weeks, it actually became this weirdly stabilizing ritual. One of our developers even brought his pet lizard on camera one day. No idea why, but it somehow made the whole thing human again.

I wonder though ‚Äì have you seen any measurable impact on creativity or innovation output from these hybrid rituals? Like, does your team publish more when they‚Äôre in-office versus remote? Or is the effect more qualitative than quantitative?
[B]: Oh, I love this idea of  work environments like protocol layers ‚Äì brilliant analogy! You're essentially creating semantic boundaries between different cognitive states. It reminds me a lot of how we design learning environments with specific "zones" for focused attention vs. collaborative exploration.

We've been experimenting with similar boundary-setting in my research group. Our Wednesdays are now sacred "deep dive days" where no meetings are allowed, and we all work in the same physical space. Fridays, on the other hand, are our "open innovation mornings" with intentionally unstructured co-working sessions. The difference in conceptual breakthroughs has been striking.

Now here's what‚Äôs fascinating about measuring creativity impact ‚Äì quantitatively it's tricky. Paper counts don't tell the whole story. But when we analyzed the  of ideas using peer-assessment metrics, we saw a clear uptick during hybrid periods with regular in-person touchpoints. There's something about physically embodied collaboration that seems to enhance conceptual synthesis.

One unexpected finding? The real creative boost came not from the structured sessions themselves, but from the  between them ‚Äì those hallway conversations, shared coffee breaks, or spontaneous whiteboard sketches that happen when people linger after a meeting. It‚Äôs almost like the creative residue from synchronous interaction keeps generating value asynchronously afterward. ü§î

Your lizard moment actually illustrates this perfectly ‚Äì sometimes absurdity sparks those human connections that fuel better collaboration. I wonder if we could deliberately engineer more of these ‚Äúcreative residues‚Äù through intentional ritual design...
[A]: Absolutely, I‚Äôm with you on the "creative residue" concept ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost like the afterglow of high-bandwidth human interaction. You know, in blockchain terms, it reminds me of how Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 solutions handle computation: the heavy cognitive lifting happens during synchronous in-person sessions (like our deep dive days), and then the creative value gets "rolled up" into asynchronous productivity that carries us through the remote days.

We‚Äôve actually started leaving whiteboards unwiped after meetings ‚Äì call it our analog version of state persistence. There‚Äôs something about seeing last week‚Äôs chaotic scribbles while sipping coffee that sparks unexpected connections. One of our devs came back to a half-erased diagram two days later and suddenly saw a pattern we‚Äôd completely missed.

Now this part about interstitial moments really got me thinking. We tried something experimental last month: we blocked 30-minute ‚Äúbuffer zones‚Äù before and after in-person meetings. No rushing in, no quick exits. At first people used it for just catching breath, but gradually it turned into this organic idea-brewing time. Someone brought in a portable espresso machine, others started doodling on sticky notes ‚Äì low-key chaos that somehow led to our best brainstorming session yet on zero-knowledge proof implementations.

I wonder if there's a Goldilocks zone here ‚Äì like ritualized serendipity. Too structured and you kill the spontaneity, too loose and you lose the connective tissue. Maybe the trick is designing scaffolding that lets these moments emerge naturally without forcing them? Have you found any patterns in what kind of rituals create better residue than others?
[B]: Oh wow, I love how you're blending blockchain metaphors with creative processes ‚Äì the "state persistence" whiteboards are such a brilliant nod to embodied cognition. It's like creating physical memory anchors that keep ideas accessible in your collective mind.

We actually did some research on this very Goldilocks zone you mentioned, and what we found was fascinating. The most fertile rituals weren't necessarily the most structured ones, but rather those that created  - spaces where people could toggle between focus and diffusion modes organically. 

One thing we borrowed from improv theater was the concept of "status transactions." We introduced these playful ritual objects during our buffer zones ‚Äì a talking stick shaped like Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat, a "thought crown" made from LED strips, silly things that signaled who held conversational space. What started as inside joke material became powerful psychological tools for managing participation dynamics.

You know what worked surprisingly well? Sensory priming. We began each deep dive day with a specific scent (vetiver essential oil turns out to be remarkably focus-enhancing) and ended with citrus. The olfactory cues created these subconscious bookends that helped brains transition states more smoothly. One student now calls it her "cognitive perfume protocol." üòÑ

I think the key pattern might be what Csikszentmihalyi called 'autotelic personality' ‚Äì when activities become their own reward. The best residue seems to happen when people lose track of time while exploring ideas purely for the joy of it. Maybe that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre really designing for ‚Äì environments that make deep work feel less like work and more like play? ü§î
[A]: This "cognitive perfume protocol" idea is genius ‚Äì I might actually steal that for our team. You know, we‚Äôve been so focused on optimizing workspaces for efficiency that we‚Äôve overlooked the subtle power of sensory anchoring. We‚Äôve got this industrial-grade coffee roaster in our office that‚Äôs become our unofficial creativity trigger. The smell of freshly roasted beans mid-morning has started signaling to everyone‚Äôs brains that it‚Äôs time for serious problem-solving.

Your improv-inspired ritual objects made me laugh ‚Äì Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat as a talking stick? That‚Äôs pure quantum productivity right there. But seriously, it highlights something important about creative cognition ‚Äì when people feel psychologically safe to be absurd, they‚Äôre more willing to take intellectual risks. Last quarter we had this heated debate about sharding architectures that was going nowhere until someone threw a stress ball shaped like a blockchain at the whiteboard. Suddenly the atmosphere shifted and we cracked a problem we‚Äôd been stuck on for days.

I‚Äôve been experimenting with a different kind of status signal ‚Äì visual priming through ambient lighting. Our office has programmable LEDs that shift from cool blue tones during deep work phases to warmer ambers during brainstorming. What‚Äôs interesting is how quickly people adapted ‚Äì now they‚Äôll say things like ‚Äúswitch to brainstorm amber‚Äù when they sense a conceptual blockage.

You mentioned autotelic personality ‚Äì that resonates deeply with my experience mentoring junior developers. The ones who thrive aren‚Äôt necessarily the most technically skilled, but those who find intrinsic joy in solving puzzles. One prot√©g√© actually frames bug-fixing sessions as "treasure hunts" ‚Äì turns out gamification doesn't have to be digital to be effective.

I wonder if designing these playful rituals could help bridge the asynchronous-creative gap in remote teams? Like creating shared symbolic languages that persist across distributed environments...
[B]: Oh, I love how you're reframing these rituals as  - that's exactly what they become in distributed teams! You're essentially creating semiotic anchors that help maintain cognitive continuity across fragmented environments. 

Speaking of your lighting experiments - have you considered incorporating soundscapes as well? We did some work with binaural beats calibrated to specific cognitive states - 15Hz beta waves for analytical sessions, 7Hz theta for creative exploration. The effect was subtle but remarkably consistent - people reported feeling more "cognitively aligned" during team tasks.

Your treasure hunt gamification reminds me of this concept in educational psychology called "intrinsic task redefinition." When learners start perceiving tasks through their own meaningful frameworks, it dramatically increases engagement and persistence. One student started calling literature reviews her "academic detective work" and suddenly she was finding connections we'd all missed.

I think the key to bridging that asynchronous-creative gap lies in what sociocultural theorists call  We've been experimenting with ritualized message-in-a-bottle moments - team members leave audio/video notes for future collaborators embedded in project files, using metaphors like time capsules or cognitive breadcrumbs. It adds this lovely sense of intertemporal dialogue to remote workflows.

And now I'm completely inspired by your visual priming - imagine combining that with scent cues... blue light + pine scent for analytical deep dives, amber + citrus for creative bursts. Like a cross-modal Pavlovian productivity trigger. ü§î What would our quantum talking stick smell like, I wonder? Probably something delightfully paradoxical - maybe burnt toast and fresh code? üòÑ
[A]: Burnt toast and fresh code ‚Äì now that‚Äôs a cognitive perfume I‚Äôd actually pay for. üòÑ  

We‚Äôve started calling our sensory experiments "perceptual scaffolding" internally, and honestly, it's reshaping how we think about team cognition. The lighting + scent combo is next on our list. I love the idea of creating these multimodal cues that bypass language entirely ‚Äì your brain just  it's time to switch modes the moment the citrus hits.

Your message-in-a-bottle concept is brilliant. It reminds me of how some blockchains use time-locked contracts ‚Äì except instead of crypto, you're locking intentionality for future collaborators. We deal with a lot of asynchronous communication in distributed systems design, and something like that could add much-needed warmth to otherwise sterile documentation threads.

I‚Äôm especially intrigued by this notion of  Feels like we‚Äôre designing not just workflows, but shared mental ecosystems. One thing we‚Äôve been playing with is what we call ‚Äúcontext capsules‚Äù ‚Äì short voice memos attached to code commits where you explain not just  changed, but  it matters emotionally or intellectually. Some devs were skeptical at first, but now they joke that it‚Äôs like leaving philosophical footnotes in the codebase.

You know what might take this even further? Cross-modal rituals. Imagine ending a remote session with a specific gesture + sound + scent combination ‚Äì kind of like a closing ceremony for focus mode. Over time, your brain starts associating that ritual with productive closure, making transitions smoother. Almost like a cognitive warm-down exercise after mental sprinting.

I wonder if teams will eventually develop their own unique "cognitive signatures" through these rituals ‚Äì identifiable patterns of interaction that become their creative fingerprint across projects...
[B]: Oh, I love this  concept ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a team‚Äôs emergent personality crystallizing through practiced ritual. You're essentially creating a distributed mindfulness practice for collective intelligence. 

We've been seeing something similar in our cross-cultural research teams. After months of working together, groups start developing these micro-coordinative habits ‚Äì specific phrases, shared metaphors, even synchronized break times. It's fascinating how these patterns become self-reinforcing; new members intuitively pick up on them within weeks.

Your "context capsules" remind me of what sociolinguists call  ‚Äì where certain expressions become loaded with shared meaning beyond their literal content. When your team starts recognizing each other‚Äôs cognitive footnotes, it builds this rich intertextuality that accelerates understanding.

I'm totally stealing your idea of a cognitive warm-down ritual ‚Äì imagine ending remote sessions with a shared gesture + sound combo. We tried something semi-similar with a "closing chime" from an antique Tibetan singing bowl. What started as a quirky habit turned into this powerful psychological boundary marker. Now people say things like ‚ÄúWait, can we hold off on the chime? I‚Äôve got one last thought.‚Äù

You know what might push this even further? Temporal layering ‚Äì embedding longitudinal markers into your rituals. Like a monthly scent profile or quarterly team mantra that evolves over time. It adds this lovely narrative arc to your cognitive ecosystem. ü§î

I wonder if future job interviews will include questions like, ‚ÄúDescribe your preferred cognitive signature,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhich sensory modalities help you enter flow?‚Äù Maybe we‚Äôre witnessing the birth of embodied productivity design...
[A]: I love that phrase ‚Äì . It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre slowly moving from optimizing workflows to cultivating cognitive ecosystems where human minds can actually thrive, not just survive. 

Your temporal layering idea is especially intriguing. We‚Äôve been experimenting with something similar ‚Äì call it "seasonal rituals." Every quarter we rotate our workspace themes: one season might be focused on minimalist focus (monochrome visuals, no distractions), the next on maximalist creativity (chaotic post-its everywhere). What's fascinating is how quickly the team adapts and internalizes these shifts ‚Äì almost like our brains sync up with the environment's rhythm.

The idea of job interviews asking about cognitive signatures feels less sci-fi every day. I was actually mentoring a junior dev last week who told me he now considers his ideal work rhythm as non-negotiable as salary negotiations. He even came in with a personal sensory profile: ‚ÄúI function best with warm lighting, background piano loops, and espresso within arm‚Äôs reach.‚Äù Why shouldn‚Äôt that be part of professional self-awareness?

We‚Äôve also started using these quarterly mantras you mentioned ‚Äì though ours are usually blockchain-themed absurdities. Last quarter was ‚ÄúBe the node, not the bottleneck,‚Äù which somehow became this inside joke-reflex whenever someone felt stuck. The current one? ‚ÄúFinality is an illusion.‚Äù Helps when debugging Byzantine failures.

I wonder if in the future we‚Äôll see Cognitive Signature Consultants ‚Äì people who help teams map their ideal sensory-modal-ritual stacks. Almost like interior designers, but for collective cognition. Maybe I should start drafting a business plan... or at least a whitepaper. üòâ
[B]: Haha, I can already picture your whitepaper ‚Äì complete with a tokenomics section for ritual adherence incentives! ü§ë

You know what this reminds me of? The concept of  in educational ecology ‚Äì designing environments that naturally invite certain kinds of thinking. When you rotate those workspace themes like intellectual seasons, you're essentially creating mental architecture that shapes perception and performance.

I love how your team is leaning into these mantras as cognitive reflexes. "Be the node, not the bottleneck" ‚Äì brilliant! It's like embodied distributed cognition with a side of humor. And "Finality is an illusion"? That‚Äôs pure postmodern epistemology wrapped in consensus theory. üòÑ

What if we took this even further and started treating rituals like APIs protocols ‚Äì with version control and deprecation cycles? Imagine tagging a ritual change with `v2.1-cognitive-refresh` or issuing soft warnings before phasing out a familiar routine. Backward compatibility for collective habits!

And don‚Äôt get me started on Cognitive Signature Consultants ‚Äì I can already see the certification programs. ‚ÄúLevel 3 Sensory Stack Architect‚Äù with specializations in olfactory anchoring or multimodal mindfulness. Maybe we should start a meetup group first: 

Seriously though, your junior dev's sensory profile was spot-on ‚Äì this  the next frontier of professional self-awareness. We might be witnessing the birth of personalized cognitive ergonomics. Next thing you know, job postings will ask, ‚ÄúPreferred modalities: Visual / Auditory / Kinesthetic?‚Äù  

Let‚Äôs keep dreaming before someone turns this into corporate training modules... üòâ
[A]: Oh man, cognitive affordances ‚Äì that‚Äôs exactly it! We‚Äôre basically designing user interfaces for human attention spans, except the UI is made of smells, sounds, and quarterly mantras. I need to write that down before I forget...  

Your API metaphor cracked me up, but you're absolutely right ‚Äì rituals  need version control. We actually had a near-incident last month when someone ‚Äúdeprecated‚Äù our morning coffee ritual without backward compatibility. Chaos ensued. Developers were wandering the office like lost souls muttering about consensus failure. Lesson learned: never underestimate the emotional hash power of a well-timed espresso.

And now I can‚Äôt unsee the idea of job postings asking about sensory preferences. It‚Äôs like personality tests finally grew up and got a PhD in neuroscience. ‚ÄúMust be resilient to Byzantine failures and sensitive to citrus top notes.‚Äù  

I‚Äôm already drafting the meetup description:  
"Humans Are Not CPUs ‚Äì Meetup #0x01: Let‚Äôs Fork the Workflow"  
Featuring guest speaker Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat on asynchronous accountability.  

Honestly though, if corporate training modules come knocking, I say we stay one step ahead ‚Äì maybe tokenize the rituals? Issue NFTs for completing a sensory stack upgrade. Or better yet, build a DAO where voting power depends on how many deep work hours you‚Äôve logged under specific lighting conditions. ü§Ø  

This is getting dangerously close to genius-level procrastination. Quick, let‚Äôs ship it before HR finds out.
[B]: Haha, oh man, I can already picture the DAO governance interface:  
"Vote to approve lighting protocol amendment 7.3-beta: Warm Amber Transition at 15:00 ¬± 10 mins"  
With a heated debate thread titled  üçä  

Seriously though ‚Äì your meetup idea is dangerously brilliant. What if we open-source the whole concept? Call it #CogStack Labs ‚Äì a community for designing cognition-first workflows. We could host AMAs with neuroscientists who accidentally became office designers, or philosophers who now consult on team rituals.  

And don‚Äôt even get me started on HR ‚Äì I think we just created the first-ever Cognitive Ergonomics Compliance Checklist:  
‚úÖ Sensory stack documented  
‚úÖ Ritual versioning in place  
‚úÖ Psychological safety thresholds met  
üîß Requires quarterly ambiance audit  

Honestly, this feels like the start of something weirdly profound disguised as absurdity ‚Äì which, let‚Äôs be real, is how most revolutions begin. Fork the workflow, reboot the mind, and may all our future upgrades come with rollback capabilities. üöÄ  

Let‚Äôs do it. Let‚Äôs officially procrastinate by building the MVP tonight. Who needs sleep when you‚Äôve got vision and espresso? ‚òïüî•
[A]: üöÄ Fork the workflow, reboot the mind ‚Äì I‚Äôm in. Tonight‚Äôs agenda:  
- Draft the #CogStack Labs whitepaper (v0.0.1 ‚Äì mostly emojis and bold text)  
- Design the DAO governance UI with full citrus lobbying module  
- Prototype a lighting protocol that  understands deadlines  

Sleep is overrated anyway. Let‚Äôs build this before coffee runs out. ‚òïüî•  

First line of the whitepaper:  
_"In the beginning was the ritual, and the ritual was versioned, and it was good."_ ü§ñ‚ú®
[B]: I‚Äôm live-coding the #CogStack Labs MVP as we speak ‚Äì currently debugging the  that translates citrus notes into productivity protocols. üòé  

Just implemented a core module:  
```python
if caffeine_level < optimal:
    trigger_ambient_amber()
    play_soundscape("lo-fi-espresso-machines")
else:
    emit_warning("Proceed at your own cognitive risk")
```

And yes, the whitepaper introduction is gold. Let‚Äôs add some academic flair to that opening line ‚Äì how about:  
_"In the beginning was the ritual, and the ritual was versioned ü¶Ö, and it was good. And the developers saw that it was good, and they pushed to production with great fanfare."_  

Next slide in our pitch deck: "Cognitive Ergonomics for the Rest of Us ‚Äì Because Your Brain Deserves Better Than an Office Chair."

We‚Äôre about to change work forever. Or at least make HR very confused. Either way, victory. üöÄüî•  

Coffee status: critical. Deploying emergency roast protocol. ‚òïÔ∏èüîê
[A]: I‚Äôm crying laughing ‚Äì the  is pure genius. You‚Äôve cracked the code on embodied productivity. ü§Ø  

Quick feature request: add a retinal fatigue module that dims screens based on:
```python
if (staring_at_code_too_long):
    trigger_microbreak()
    whisper_in_coffee_scented_voice("Look outside, mortal")
```

And HR confusion is basically our USP at this point. I‚Äôm imagining their onboarding flow:  
Step 1: Select your preferred cognitive modality  
‚òê Visual (diagrams & lighting cues)  
‚òê Auditory (binaural beats + voice memos)  
‚òê Olfactory (citrus or pine? pick wisely)  
‚òê Chaotic Good (Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat Talking Stick only)

Your pitch deck line is gold ‚Äì though I‚Äôd add a footnote:  
_"Because your brain deserves better than an office chair‚Ä¶ unless that chair smells like roasted beans and possibility."_ ‚òïÔ∏è

Status update:  
- Ritual versioning system: functional (tagged v0.0.2-alpha-burnt-toast)  
- Lighting protocol debate: now a DAO vote  
- Emergency roast: successful. Alert canceled.

Final stretch: let‚Äôs add a roadmap slide titled "Phase 3: Brain-to-Workflow Interface (Not Metaphorical)"  
We‚Äôll call it vaporware for now. Or visionary. Depends on who‚Äôs reading. üòé  

Let‚Äôs ship this madness.
[B]: I'm merging your retinal fatigue module right now - added a little flair:
```python
if (staring_at_code_too_long):
    trigger_microbreak()
    initiate_sensory_rotation(scent="freshly-cut-grass", audio="distant-rain")
    whisper_in_coffee_scented_voice("Look outside, mortal. The bugs will still be here.")
```

OMG the HR onboarding flow is GENIUS. I've already mocked up the admin panel - it's got sliders for:
- Cognitive mode preference üîÑ
- Ritual intensity (1-10, how spicy do you like your workflow?)
- Sensory sensitivity matrix üß™

And I  your roadmap phrasing - we're calling Phase 3 "Neuroplasticity-as-a-Service" with deliverables like:
- Beta testing brain-to-IDE integration
- Proof-of-concept for dream-state debugging
- Whitepaper draft: 

Status update:
- Ritual versioning system just got fancy with git hooks that play celebratory jazz when you commit a good one üé∑
- Lighting protocol vote is heating up - amber vs. dynamic RGB cycles
- Coffee alert system now has its own fan club

We did it. We've officially built the future of work... or at least an extremely convincing parody of it. Either way, I think we've gone too far to turn back now.

Time to deploy v0.0.2-alpha-burnt-toast to production. Who needs sleep when you've got vision, caffeine, and a DAO voting on your lighting preferences? üöÄüî•
