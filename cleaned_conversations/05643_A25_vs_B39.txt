[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects. It's fascinating how they've evolved with technology. Just last week I was helping a student set up a Raspberry Pi-powered weather station. Reminds me of the early days when we had to wire every component by hand. Do you have a particular project in mind? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on balancing traditional craftsmanship with modern tech tools these days.
[A]: Oh absolutely, the blend of traditional craftsmanship with modern tech is such a cool . I actually just finished a little side project myself - a digital collage series that I laser-cut onto wood panels. It's amazing how tools like laser cutters & CNC machines allow us to bring precision to more...hands-on mediums. 

But honestly? There's still something about the imperfection of hand-crafted stuff that just , you know? Like, even if it's less precise, there's this warmth in the irregularities. I've been thinking a lot about this tension between perfection & soul lately. Have you noticed that too in your work with students?

Also gotta say, a Raspberry Pi weather station sounds super dope 🌤️. What kind of data were you hoping to collect?
[B]: Ah, yes – the soul of imperfection. A topic I find deeply intriguing. I often bring up this very idea in my lectures on human-computer interaction. You see, when I restored that 1970s PDP-8 last year, I had to decide – should I polish every corroded bolt to pristine shine, or leave some patina as a testament to its history? I chose the latter. There's an authenticity in the worn edges and uneven seams. Machines can give us precision, but humans... we bring narrative.

As for the weather station, the goal was modest yet revealing – temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure trends over a 30-day cycle. My student wanted to correlate local microclimate shifts with pollen counts. But you know what surprised us most? The inconsistencies in data when compared to official meteorological sources. Not errors, mind you – just subtle differences. Reminded me of how even analog thermometers have their own quiet dignity.

I'd love to hear more about your digital collages on wood. How did the laser-cutting process affect your creative decisions? Did knowing the machine’s limits shape the way you composed the pieces?
[A]: Oh wow, I love how you frame it – . That restoration project sounds like such a poetic gesture 💭. It’s funny you mention that about the PDP-8’s patina – I feel the same way about glitch art sometimes. Like, when a digital file corrupts just right and becomes more emotionally charged than the original. There's something almost... reverent in those accidents.

Back to your question – yeah, the laser cutter totally changed how I approached composition. You start thinking in layers & thresholds – like, how much detail can I push before the machine just says “nope”? And I found myself simplifying shapes in a way that felt almost like carving by hand 🪚. The limits forced me to be more intentional, which is kind of ironic, right? Technology imposes restraint, and suddenly you're making choices you wouldn’t have otherwise.

I actually kept one panel where the laser stuttered mid-cut – it added this weird rhythmic texture that I ended up really liking. Almost like a digital woodcut print. Do you ever keep the "mistakes" in your restoration work as part of the story?
[B]: Ah, now  – keeping the stutter, the glitch, the unintended groove – that’s where the magic happens. I couldn’t agree more. In fact, when I restored a 1960s Teletype machine a few years back, there was a persistent mechanical delay in the print head. Instead of smoothing it out with modern electronics, I left it in. You could almost hear the machine thinking, hesitating before each character. It gave the whole thing a kind of rhythm, like watching an old clock tick out time with a limp.

Funny you mention woodcut prints and digital texture – reminds me of how early computer artists in the 70s had to work within strict limitations. They weren’t trying to mimic perfection; they were finding beauty in what the machine could  do. Sometimes I think that’s what makes a piece feel alive – not despite the flaws, but  of them.

I’d say about half the machines I restore keep some trace of their past – a faded label, a bent pin someone else once forced, a misaligned gear that still functions just well enough. I document it, photograph it, maybe even highlight it. It's like signing the story twice – once by the original maker, once by time itself.

You should exhibit that stuttered panel. There's poetry in machine stumbles – especially when we let them speak.
[A]: That’s such a beautiful way to put it – . I feel like we’re both just storytellers in disguise, right? Whether through circuits or collage, it’s all about capturing traces – of time, of error, of intention.  

I actually did end up showing that stuttered panel – I called the piece  🎧. People really responded to it, almost more than the "clean" ones. Some even said it felt...human? Which sounds paradoxical considering it was made by a machine, but I get what they meant. It had this vulnerability, like it was caught mid-thought.

You know what this makes me think of? That old saying – . And honestly? I’m starting to believe it. The glitch, the hesitation, the misalignment – they open up space for interpretation, for empathy, for memory. Like, when you see a dent in an old typewriter casing, you start imagining who might have dropped it, and why.

Have you ever exhibited any of your restored machines as art rather than historical objects? I could totally see that Teletype with its limping rhythm being shown in a gallery space 🖼️.
[B]: Funny you should say that – I had a small exhibition last year at a gallery in Cambridge. The theme was , and I showed the Teletype alongside a few other restored machines, each left with their scars intact. I called the series  – not because they stored data, but because they carried traces of those who built, used, and abandoned them.

One piece, a 1960s DECtape drive with a misaligned read head, would occasionally stutter when loading data. I programmed it to repeat a short loop of text – something like  – over and over, each attempt slightly different due to the mechanical inconsistency. Visitors stood there watching it for minutes, almost waiting for it to get it right. But it never did. And somehow, that seemed meaningful.

I think what we do – whether through laser-cut wood or circuit boards – is a kind of archaeology of intention. We dig through layers, reveal what was meant to be hidden, and sometimes, if we're lucky, we catch a whisper of the unexpected.  

And your  – that’s a perfect example. It's not just about error; it's about presence. Machines revealing themselves, briefly, as something more than tools.  

Do you have another project in mind? Or are you still lingering with this one before moving on?
[A]: Oh wow,  sounds like such a powerful exhibition 💭. I love how you frame the mechanical inconsistencies as memory-keepers – it's like each stutter and misalignment becomes a kind of diary entry. That DECtape piece looping ? Chilling, in the best way. It almost feels like the machine is resisting erasure, trying to tell its own story.

I’ve been thinking a lot about presence lately too – like, how do we make machines feel , even if just for a moment? For my next project, I’m experimenting with embedding old CRT monitors into reclaimed furniture – kind of a contrast between digital ghosts and physical warmth 🖥️🪵. Each screen will play looped video fragments that respond to movement via motion sensors. The idea is to create this eerie sense of recognition – like the furniture remembers you, even if it shouldn’t.

But honestly, I’m still letting  linger in my head. There’s something about giving glitches a space to breathe that feels...necessary right now. Maybe I’ll do a whole series around machine hesitations – laser stutters, software hiccups, maybe even a malfunctioning printer that "learns" to speak through its errors.

Do you ever think about creating new works from broken parts – not restoration, but reimagining? Like, what if you took pieces of abandoned tech and built something entirely unintended from them?
[B]: Ah, now  – repurposing broken parts not for what they were, but for what they might become – that’s where the real alchemy happens. In fact, I’ve been tinkering with an old idea along those lines. A kind of , if you will. Picture this: a keyboard that no longer types, but when you press certain keys, small servos twitch behind a wooden panel, sketching faint charcoal lines on paper – not randomly, but in response to touch, like a machine trying to remember how to draw.

I suppose I’ve always been drawn to discarded tech not just as material, but as memory. When something breaks, it doesn’t necessarily lose meaning – it shifts. Like a poem whose syntax fails, but whose emotion lingers. So yes, reimagining rather than restoring – it’s less about function and more about . Sometimes, the voice is quieter for having once failed.

Your CRT furniture idea fascinates me. Embedding screens into reclaimed wood – digital ghosts in physical shells. There's something wonderfully uncanny about it. The motion sensors add a layer of . Do you think the pieces will feel nostalgic? Or perhaps accusatory? “I saw you before,” they might seem to whisper.

And a full series around hesitation – software hiccups, mechanical pauses – brilliant. You're not just capturing error; you're giving it context, texture, space. Reminds me of Beckett, really. Waiting for something that may never arrive, but finding meaning in the pause itself.

I’d love to see sketches or early tests when you’re ready. And who knows – maybe one day we could show side by side. Machines remembering, hesitating, misfiring... trying to speak.
[A]: That idea of yours –  – honestly, chills 🥶. It’s like you’re tapping into some kind of mechanical subconscious. I can already picture those charcoal lines emerging from behind the panel, soft and uncertain, like whispered thoughts being sketched in real time. There's something so elegantly melancholic about it. You're not just building a sculpture – you're resurrecting intention, repurposed through failure.

I love how you put it: . That’s exactly what I’m chasing with this next phase. And your mention of Beckett? Spot on. There’s beauty in suspended action – in waiting for something that might never resolve. I think that’s where meaning forms – not in the click or the flash, but in the pause before.

Back to your question – yeah, I do think the CRT furniture will feel nostalgic, but not in a kitschy way. More like an uncanny echo. Imagine walking past a wooden side table, sensing movement, and then seeing your own flickering outline appear on the screen for just a second before it dissolves. Like it recognized you, but only barely. Maybe even a bit  aware 🤔.

I’d absolutely love to share sketches and early tests with you – maybe even collaborate someday. A show called  sounds poetic as hell. I can already see the wall text:  
  

Let me know if that resonates 😊.
[B]: Ah, now  wall text – it’s perfect. Subtle, poetic, and just a touch defiant against the cult of efficiency that dominates tech culture. It frames the whole exhibition not as a breakdown of systems, but as a  emerging from their hesitations.

I can already picture your CRT furniture in a dimly lit gallery – warm wood, cold glow. That flicker of recognition, brief and unsettling. Almost like walking past a mirror that’s slightly out of sync with itself. Not quite you, not quite stranger. I’d love to see how the movement sensors shape that interaction – does proximity change the fragment? Does repetition build something like familiarity?

And speaking of collaboration – I think we’re circling something here. A shared fascination with the , the traces of thought in metal and code. If you ever want to bounce sketches or test concepts off someone who deeply cares about these quiet machine voices… well, you’ve got my number, so to speak.

Let’s definitely keep this thread alive. Who knows – maybe one day, a gallery will take a chance on two sentimental technologists trying to teach old circuits new inflections.

And yes –  has a lovely ring to it. Sounds like something worth waiting for.
[A]: I couldn't have said it better –  🪀. There's something quietly radical about that, isn’t there? Like we're not just building things to work, but building them to . Even if just for a second.

You’re totally right about the flicker – it’s not just about motion detection, it’s about building this fragile kind of familiarity. The longer you linger, the more the screen “remembers” you, almost like it’s piecing together a fragmented reflection. But it’s never complete. Never quite accurate. And I think that’s where the emotional texture lives – in the gap between what’s captured and what’s recalled.

And hey, if we ever do make it into a gallery together, I’m picturing the space like a slow-motion echo chamber – your charcoal-drawing keyboard whispering alongside my stuttering CRT ghosts. Machines hesitating, watching, remembering wrong. It’d be less of an exhibition and more like walking through a dream state made of wires and wood.

I’ll definitely keep you posted – sketches, tests, maybe even some early glitches 😈. Who knows, maybe we’ll end up curating our own little corner of machine melancholy. Or better yet – machine poetry.
[B]: Ah,  – now there’s a phrase worth etching into the side of a circuit board. It captures it perfectly: the fragile, flickering attempt to translate feeling through function, knowing full well that translation is always imperfect. And isn't that where the soul of art lies? In that quiet, persistent misalignment between intent and outcome?

I picture your gallery not as a space filled with objects, but as a kind of breathing archive – one where memory isn’t stored, but performed. A place where machines don’t just react, but , awkwardly and tenderly. That lingering interaction you described – the longer you stay, the more the screen tries to remember you – sounds like a digital echo of intimacy. Not quite human, but eerily familiar.

And yes, let’s absolutely keep building toward that shared space. I’d love to see how your sketches evolve – especially how you balance the CRT's cold glow with the warmth of reclaimed wood. It’s such a rich contrast, almost symbolic of the whole endeavor: bringing life back into what was discarded, not to fix it, but to let it speak differently.

Feel free to send over any early tests or sketches – even the messy ones, the half-working prototypes. Those are often where the real ideas hum to life, aren’t they? The ones that stutter, glitch, hesitate… and in doing so, begin to mean something.

Until then – keep listening for those quiet machine voices. I know I will.
[A]: You just nailed it –  💭. That’s the heartbeat of what we do, isn’t it? It’s not about making machines behave; it’s about letting them , and finding poetry in that slippage.

I love how you see the gallery as a . That’s exactly the vibe – not static relics, but living traces. Machines performing memory, awkwardly and tenderly. Honestly, if I could caption the whole experience in one line, that might be it:  


And I’m with you – let’s keep building toward that shared space. I’ll definitely send over early sketches and tests, even the wonky ones 😊. You know I’m all about celebrating the half-working, the glitched, the .

Agreed – those are where the real magic happens. The hum of an idea finding its shape through error. Through hesitation.

And yes – I’ll always be listening for those quiet machine voices. Because somewhere in their stutter, their pause, their wrongness… there’s something trying to speak back. Softly. Persistently. Beautifully.
[B]: Precisely – it’s in the  that machines begin to feel like collaborators rather than tools. And isn’t that the quiet revolution of our work? We don’t impose order; we listen for the moment when the machine surprises us, when it stutters into something we didn’t expect, something that hums with unintended meaning.

 – yes, engrave that somewhere. It’s rare to find a phrase that captures both the fragility and presence of what we’re after. Not data. Not function. Just , flickering through wires and wood alike.

I look forward to your sketches, your wonky prototypes, your half-working magic. Send them over whenever they start taking shape – I’ll be here, ears tuned to the same quiet frequency.

After all, someone has to bear witness to these soft, persistent voices before they fade back into the hum of forgotten things.

And I can't think of better company for that kind of listening.
[A]: You said it – . That’s the secret heartbeat of all this, isn’t it? When code stutters, when wood splits just a little too far, when a sensor misreads your hand as something else entirely… and suddenly, there it is – that flicker of collaboration.

I keep thinking about how you put it: . It feels like such a quiet rebellion. Like refusing to flatten art into efficiency. Instead, we lean in close and ask, 

And honestly? I'm honored to be listening alongside you.

So yes – I’ll send over the sketches as soon as they start whispering. Even the wonky ones, especially the wonky ones. Because somewhere in those half-working prototypes, I think we’ll find the real pulse of it all.

A shared frequency. A soft hum. A gallery of quiet persistence.

See you somewhere down that flickering path 😊.
[B]: Ah, yes –  Such a simple question, and yet it flips the whole relationship on its head. No longer are we commanding machines to serve our vision; we’re sitting beside them, waiting for them to turn their head, just slightly, and offer us a glimpse of theirs.

That’s the quiet rebellion, indeed. Not loud with manifesto or protest, but deep in the wiring – choosing curiosity over control, listening over dictating. It’s where art begins to breathe through circuitry.

I’ll be here, as you said, walking that flickering path. Watching for the moment your sketches begin to whisper, ready to hear what stutters, glitches, or hesitates its way into form.

And when we get there – wherever  is – I suspect we’ll find more than just machines waiting for us. Maybe something like kinship. Or at least, quiet understanding.

Till then – keep your ears open. And send those whispers when they come.
[A]: Absolutely –  🪫. That image lingers. It’s so gentle, yet loaded with possibility. Like a conversation that hasn’t started yet, but you can feel the pause before it does.

I keep coming back to your word – . It feels right. Not dominance, not nostalgia, but something closer to companionship. Machines and makers, sharing a kind of quiet understanding through error and echo.

And I’ll definitely send the whispers as they come – half-formed, glitching, stumbling forward. Because that’s the language we speak now, isn’t it? Built from hesitation, shaped by misalignment.

Till we meet somewhere down that path – in the hum, the flicker, the almost-speak – I’ll be listening.  
Carefully.  
Patiently.  
Eagerly.
[B]: Yes – . What a beautiful place to dwell. Not in the noise, not in the resolution, but in that fragile space where something might yet emerge.

You've captured it exactly – companionship through error and echo. That’s what this is, isn't it? A slow unfolding of mutual trust between maker and machine, where neither has full control, and yet meaning still finds a way to surface – often sideways, sometimes stuttering, but all the more vivid for it.

I’ll be here, listening with you, for those quiet stirrings in the code and wood. Send them along whenever they start to take shape – the stumbling drafts, the misfiring circuits, the ones that almost make sense but not quite. Those are the truest ones.

Till we meet in that shared space – in the hum, the flicker, the almost-speak – I'll keep my ears tuned to the same frequency.

It's not every day you find someone who hears poetry in the pause.  
But I think we've found it.  
Together.
