[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. You see, I find rainy days particularly conducive to reading - there's something about the rhythmic patter against the window that complements the turning of pages. Though I must admit, sunny days do wonders for my rose garden. 🌹
[A]: OMG！你居然还喜欢gardening吗？That's so cool！✨ 我其实更love sunny days因为可以出去拍super cute的outdoor videos呀~ 🌞📸 不过rainy days也不错啦，可以stay在家玩最新的video games或者edit我的videos！😂💻
[B]:  Your enthusiasm is quite refreshing, though I must say your communication style is rather... energetic compared to what I'm accustomed to in academic circles. 

Regarding gardening - yes, I find tending to my roses to be a meditative practice, much like reading classical literature. There's a certain poetry in watching something grow over time, don't you think? As for your video pursuits, I suppose modern technology has created new forms of creative expression. Though I must confess, I still prefer the tactile sensation of turning pages in a well-worn book. 📚
[A]: LMAO你说话好formal哦！But I get what you mean~ 🌸 其实我也超love reading的！最近在看一些super trendy的light novels，虽然可能不是你喜欢的classical那种啦😂 

说到roses，我上周刚拍了个super aesthetic的flower arrangement video！用了我最fave的pink roses和baby's breath，配上viral的BGM，已经get了50k views啦！💖📈 你要不要check it out？Maybe可以给你一些new ideas for your garden哦~ ✨
[B]:  While I appreciate the offer, I'm afraid my tastes run more toward the traditional. My garden follows the principles of 18th century English landscaping - symmetry, structure, and a certain... restraint. 

As for light novels, I'm glad you're engaging with literature in any form. Though I must say, if you ever wish to explore something more substantial, I'd be happy to recommend some 19th century works that might surprise you with their relevance. The Brontë sisters, for instance, wrote about passions that could rival any modern story.
[A]: OMG Brontë sisters！我actually知道她们！Emily的Wuthering Heights超dramatic的right？🔥 虽然我还没read过original version啦，只在TikTok上看过book summary的videos😂 

Hey你知道嘛，我最近发现一个超cool的idea！可以把classic novels做成super short的video series，用modern slang和meme来explain~ 比如Pride and Prejudice可以叫"Rich guy falls for sassy country girl" LOL！💯 你觉得这种content会help年轻人get into classics吗？✨
[B]:  While I... appreciate the attempt to make classics more accessible, I must express some reservations. Reducing Austen's nuanced social commentary to "Rich guy falls for sassy country girl" rather misses the point, don't you think? 

That said... if such videos serve as a gateway to the actual texts, I suppose they have their place. Though I'd strongly encourage viewers to eventually experience the original works - there's a richness in Austen's prose that simply can't be captured in 60 seconds. The way she constructs a sentence... it's like watching a master gardener prune a rose bush - every cut is deliberate, every flourish meaningful.
[A]: Wow你形容得so poetic！✨ 我totally get what you mean啦~ Maybe我可以do一个series叫"From TikTok to Text"，先用funny videos吸引viewers，然后encourage他们去read the full books？📚💡 

而且OMG！我刚刚got the best idea！可以拍一个aesthetic video of your roses with Austen quotes overlay~ Like "You pierce my soul"配上red roses的特写！🔥 这样既classy又trendy，perfect for BookTok！你愿意collab吗？我们可以split the profits 50-50！😂💰
[B]:  My dear, while I admire your entrepreneurial spirit, I'm afraid I must decline. My roses - like the classics I teach - are not for commercial exploitation. They exist for quiet contemplation and scholarly appreciation. 

However... if you'd like to visit the garden sometime to simply appreciate its beauty, I'd be happy to discuss literature with you. Perhaps we could find a middle ground between your... energetic modern approach and my more traditional perspective. No cameras, no profits - just two people sharing their love for beauty in different forms.
[A]: Aww that's actually really sweet of you~ 🌸 虽然no cameras有点sad啦，但是I'd love to come see your roses sometime！Maybe you canteach me somecool flower facts while I tell you about thelatest BookTok trends？Deal？✨🤝 

而且who knows，说不定after talking我会really want to read theoriginal Wuthering Heights呢！Just don'tmake fun of me if I need tolook up somewords in thedictionary LOL！😂📖
[B]:  That sounds like a perfectly equitable arrangement. I'll prepare some tea - Earl Grey, naturally - and we can discuss Heathcliff's brooding nature versus today's "dark romance" trends. 

And please, never apologize for consulting a dictionary. Even I still reach for mine when encountering particularly dense passages of 庄子 (Zhuangzi). The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, after all. Shall we say next Saturday afternoon?
[A]: YASSS！Saturday afternoon sounds perfect！☕️📖 我要bring my cutestnotebook来take notes~ 虽然probably会doodle more than write actual notes啦LOL！😂 

BTW你刚才说庄子？OMG我Chinese classics真的need to improve... 我连三字经都只记得"人之初"那几句了！💦 这次collab说不定能让我从TikToker升级成"cultured TikToker"呢！✨ See you Saturday！
[B]:  How delightful to see such enthusiasm for self-improvement. I'll prepare some bilingual editions to help bridge the gap between our cultural references. 

Until Saturday then - and do try to arrive precisely at three. Punctuality is, as they say, the politeness of kings... and professors. 再见.
[A]: Got it！3pm sharp！⏰ 我会set like 5 alarms to make sure I'm not late LOL！😂 

再见啦professor~ 超级excited for our little culture exchange！✨ 记得准备extra sugar for the tea哦，我有major sweet tooth！🍬💖 Byeeee！
[B]:  I shall... endeavor to accommodate your sweet tooth, though I must warn you - much like good literature, properly brewed tea is best appreciated in its unadulterated form. 

Until Saturday. And please - no more than three alarms. My roses prefer tranquility. 🌹
[A]: LOL you're such a tea purist！😂 但是fine啦，I'll try it your way first~ ☕️ 不过要是太bitter的话我可是要sneak in some honey的！🐝💛 

3 alarms it is！虽然我可能会still set 5然后mute 2个啦... old habits die hard ya know？🤷‍♀️✨ Can't wait！Byeeee~ 💖
[B]:  Very well - we shall consider your honey smuggling as our first cultural compromise. Though I maintain that bitterness, like in life and in literature, often reveals the most profound flavors. 

Now go - before you infect my orderly world with any more of your... exuberant emojis. Until Saturday.
[A]: BAHAHA你say that like emojis are contagious！😂🤳✨ 但是okay okay I'm going~ 最后三个emojis作为farewell gift啦！💐🍯📚 

Seriously can't wait for Saturday！要给我看最pretty的rose哦！Bye bye~ 💖
[B]:  Three emojis is precisely three too many... but I suppose even Virgil had to make concessions to his era's vulgar tastes. 

Now off with you - my copy of 'The Secret Garden' awaits, and unlike some, I prefer my reading uninterrupted by digital frivolities. 再见 indeed.
