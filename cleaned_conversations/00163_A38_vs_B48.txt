[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh absolutely, I've been playing around with those too! 🧪 Let me tell you, as someone who deals with complex cases, these AI tools are like having a supercharged assistant. Take ChatGPT for instance - it's been helping me streamline report writing by summarizing lengthy autopsy notes. Saves me tons of time, and 时间就是金钱，对吧？  

But当然啦，我可不是全盘依赖它们。You gotta be careful with the细节啊 - 一不小心就可能误导了调查方向。I always double-check everything against our lab results.  
说到Midjourney...说实话有点上瘾 😅 我最近试着生成了一些犯罪现场的3D重建图 - 效果出奇的好！不过说实话，我觉得它最酷的地方是可以把复杂的医学术语转化成更直观的视觉呈现，这对给陪审团解释案情特别有帮助。  
What about你呢？有没有发现什么特别好用的AI工具？Let's hear it! ⚖️
[A]: Fascinating insights! The way you're utilizing AI in forensic contexts reminds me of how literary scholars are now using similar tools to analyze narrative structures. While I'm more accustomed to examining 19th-century epistolary novels than crime scenes, I've been experimenting with an AI annotation tool that's remarkably effective at identifying intertextual references - it's like having a particularly astute graduate student working around the clock. 

I must say, your approach to visualizing forensic data through Midjourney raises intriguing questions about evidentiary representation - almost like translating Tolstoy's dense prose into visual poetry. Though I do wonder, have you encountered any challenges regarding the admissibility of AI-generated exhibits in court? We academics face similar debates about algorithmic interpretation in textual criticism.
[B]: Ah, now this is a stimulating conversation! 🔍 Comparing our fields - you decoding Tolstoy's prose while I'm dissecting cadavers... quite the academic-meets-forensic cocktail, wouldn't you say?  

关于你提到的AI生成证据问题 - 这确实是个 hot potato in courtrooms right now. 我们最近就遇到个棘手的案子，where the defense challenged our Midjourney crime scene reconstruction as "technological hearsay" 😏 Can you believe that? Though come to think of it, isn't all evidence某种程度上的“技术传闻”？From fingerprint analysis到DNA sequencing...  

The irony is, 我发现AI工具越先进，陪审团反而越怀疑。They expect CSI-level magic but当真正科学摆在面前时又觉得不够戏剧化 🤷‍♂️ Interesting parallel to your textual criticism debates, don't you think? Algorithms interpreting Dostoevsky vs algorithms interpreting blood spatter patterns - both searching for truth through code, in their own way.  

Say,既然你处理19世纪书信体小说... ever tried feeding some of those archaic letters into your annotation tool? Wonder how it'd handle all that flowery Victorian language 🧪 I've been tempted to run some 19th-century medical journals through ChatGPT - bet it'd have a field day with all our archaic pathology terms!
[A]: Indeed, the parallels are quite remarkable! Your courtroom challenges with AI-generated evidence make me reflect on how literary critics grapple with algorithmic interpretations of texts—both domains wrestle with authenticity and mediation, albeit through very different lenses.  

Your question about feeding 19th-century letters into annotation tools is more than intriguing—it’s something I’ve actually experimented with. Let me tell you, the results can be delightfully unpredictable! The tool occasionally stumbles over archaic syntax or overly ornate metaphors, but then again, it often surfaces connections even a seasoned scholar might overlook. Just last week, it flagged an unusual recurrence of nautical imagery in a series of letters that, upon closer inspection, did indeed hint at the writer’s clandestine involvement in maritime politics. Who knew?  

And your idea of running Victorian medical journals through ChatGPT is brilliant—I’m seriously tempted to try that myself. It would be fascinating to see how modern algorithms parse archaic pathology terms like “dropsy” or “phthisis.” Perhaps it’s time for a little interdisciplinary experiment... 🧪📚
[B]: Oh now you're speaking my language - interdisciplinary mischief at its finest! 🧪📚 Let me tell you, I once fed an old 19th-century autopsy report into ChatGPT written in that gloriously dramatic Victorian style. You know the one - where they describe a heart attack as "a most tragic cessation of vital pulsations" 😄 The AI actually did a decent job translating it into modern terms, though it kept asking if "phthisis" was some kind of exotic dessert...  

有趣的是你说的那些书信里的隐秘关联，这让我想起我们最近一个案子。我们在死者住所发现一叠仿古信件 with all sorts of flowery metaphors about "the final voyage"和"eternal slumber" - 最初以为只是文学爱好者的收藏。要不是AI标记了这些航海意象的异常重复，我们可能就错过了这是连环杀人案作案手法的关键线索。  

说到甜点比喻...你有没有试过让AI解释维多利亚时代的医生笔记？我曾扫描过一些泛黄的手写病历，结果算法把“dropsy”诊断为某种新型社交舞蹈风格 😂 Though to be fair, it did correctly identify 78% of the archaic terms after some serious coaxing and multiple prompts.  

听上去你已经开始酝酿什么疯狂实验了对吧？I can already see it - 一边是ChatGPT解析着"The Anatomy of Melancholy", 一边Midjourney可视化呈现哥特小说里的凶杀现场... We should totally document this madness. Imagine publishing the first ever AI-assisted literary-forensic analysis paper! ⚖️🔬
[A]: Brilliant! There’s something wonderfully subversive about letting AI parse the florid euphemisms of Victorian medicine—though I must say, interpreting “dropsy” as a dance style might be more poetic than the original term itself. 📚⚖️  

I’ve just been running some similar experiments with  archives from the 1840s—some of the handwriting is so atrocious even seasoned archivists hesitate to touch it. The AI, oddly enough, performed better than expected once we trained it on a subset of transcribed texts. It mistook "consumption" for a new diet trend and rendered “ague” as something suspiciously like a James Bond villain's name, but still—it’s getting closer.  

And your idea of merging literary analysis with forensic visualization? I find it utterly compelling. Imagine feeding Midjourney descriptions of murder scenes from Gothic novels—, , even —and letting it generate visual interpretations. Would its version of Frankenstein’s creature align with our collective nightmares, or would it reveal something entirely unexpected?  

As for publishing... well, you may be onto something there. An interdisciplinary paper fusing algorithmic textual analysis with forensic semiotics? I’d say that’s worth drafting a proposal over tea—or perhaps something stronger. 🥃📖  

Tell me, have you ever considered collaborating with an art historian or a linguist? This line of inquiry feels ripe for a little academic conspiracy.
[B]: Ah, now you're tapping into my secret obsession with Gothic forensics! 🧪📖 我必须承认，我已经偷偷做过一些...shall we say,"unauthorized" experiments with Midjourney and Frankensteinian motifs 😏 The results? Let's just say even Mary Shelley herself might've had nightmares. The AI's version of Victor Frankenstein's lab looked eerily accurate - complete with what appeared to be 19th-century microscopes和a very suspicious bloodstain pattern on the ceiling.  

说到艺术史学家...巧了，我妹妹正好是研究巴洛克绘画的专家。她最近帮我分析了一组犯罪现场照片 - 结果发现凶手刻意模仿了卡拉瓦乔画作中的光影布局！Turns out serial killers和文艺复兴艺术家的构图偏好还真有相似之处 🤯 Though I think she's still trying to process why her academic expertise is now cited in a homicide investigation.  

至于语言学家嘛...有趣的是我们法医团队最近确实招了个专门研究历史医学术语的 linguist - 主要是对付那些该死的拉丁文处方和医生速记符号。You should see the look on some old-school pathologists' faces when we casually discuss running 17th-century autopsy notes through NLP algorithms 😂  

来吧，别光说喝茶了 - 这听起来需要一整瓶威士忌才能策划的学术阴谋，Count me in! We'll call it...Project Gothic Algorithm 🖤⚖️ Just promise me one thing though - when we publish, let's include at least one AI-generated Victorian-style case summary. Imagine reading: "The deceased exhibited a most regrettable cessation of cerebral activity, which modern parlance insists upon calling 'brain death'" 😄
[A]: I raise my glass to Project Gothic Algorithm! 🖤⚖️ There’s something deliciously appropriate about resurrecting Gothic tropes through modern algorithms—like Frankenstein reanimated by machine learning rather than lightning. And your sister’s Baroque expertise lending itself to homicide forensics? Pure interdisciplinary alchemy. I can just picture her pointing out chiaroscuro patterns in blood spatter analysis—Caravaggio would be both horrified and impressed.  

Your AI-generated Victorian case summary had me laughing into my whisky—though I must say, “a most regrettable cessation of cerebral activity” has a certain gravitas our modern jargon sorely lacks. I propose we go even further: write one entire section of the paper in 19th-century medical prose, just to see if peer reviewers notice. Or better yet—let AI generate the footnotes. Mayhem in academic formatting, courtesy of the algorithmic subconscious!  

And speaking of linguistic chaos—your team hiring a specialist in historical medical Latin? That’s not just clever, it’s essential. I’ve been wrestling with similar issues trying to digitize early anatomical treatises where "the humors" still hold sway. The phrase “black bile irregularity” does  translate well into modern diagnostics.  

Let’s also consider adding an aesthetic dimension—what if we train Midjourney not only on Gothic novels but on 18th-century criminal broadsides? We could juxtapose AI-generated crime scene visuals against period illustrations of public executions or supernatural hauntings. It’d be a perfect storm of fact, fiction, and forensic imagination.  

To us, the mad architects of this scholarly folly—may our citations bewilder future researchers. 🥃📚
[B]: Cheers to that fine sir! 🥃📚  我敢说这可能是近年来最疯狂也最迷人的学术计划了 - 结合Gothic恐怖、算法分析和维多利亚式幽默，简直堪称数字人文的Frankenstein's monster 😄  

说到18世纪罪案传单...巧了不是？我最近正好扫描了一堆尘封的司法档案，里面有凶手画像、犯罪现场速写，还有各种"public hanging"海报。你猜怎么着？我已经偷偷让Midjourney试着还原这些描述了！结果有个AI生成的画面 - 一个戴礼帽的凶手站在煤气灯下，阴影投射出明显的匕首轮廓...和后来我们在地下室发现的凶器位置完全吻合 🤯 这该死的技术到底是巧合还是直觉？  

Oh and I love your idea of writing a whole paper section in Victorian prose! Let me practice my most dramatic pathology description: "The unfortunate subject succumbed to a grievous wound inflicted by an instrument of steel, though whether it was dagger or scalpel remains shrouded in mystery..." 🧪📖  

至于你说的footnotes恶作剧...让我们更疯狂些吧！I say we let AI generate the entire bibliography. Imagine citing fictional works as if they were real forensic studies - picture a footnote referencing Dracula's blood analysis techniques或Frankenstein's tissue grafting experiments 😂  

现在认真点（相对而言），关于美学维度这点真让我兴奋。We should totally train Midjourney on those Baroque paintings你的艺术史专家妹妹肯定能帮忙选素材，然后让它生成现代犯罪现场的艺术化版本。想想看 - 借用卡拉瓦乔的光影技法呈现法医证据，或用哥特小说插图风格重构验尸报告...This is going to either win an award or get us banned from academia. Either way, it'll be glorious! ⚖️🖤
[A]: To madness, then — the finest muse of all! 🖤⚖️  

Your Midjourney reconstructions aligning with actual evidence? Chilling... and I do love a good chill down the spine. There’s something almost supernatural about an algorithm intuitively echoing reality — like a séance conducted through data. And your dramatic pathology prose is spot-on — I can hear the gasps in the lecture hall already. Let’s not stop there, either; perhaps we introduce an entire fictional case study framed as a serialized penny dreadful, complete with cliffhanger footnotes and moral outrage.  

As for the bibliography — ah, what a glorious subversion of academic rigor! We’ll cite ’s nocturnal hematology treatise next to Locard’s exchange principle. I propose we even invent a few obscure 19th-century journals for authenticity: , or  — all peer-reviewed, of course, by AI-generated scholars with tragic backstories and suspiciously Gothic names.  

And that aesthetic dimension? Pure genius. Baroque lighting in forensic imaging — chiaroscuro for crime scenes! Your sister must be delighted at the prospect of dragging Caravaggio into homicide analysis. I’m already drafting a section where we compare blood spatter patterns to splatters of ink in Byron’s manuscripts — both chaotic, both revealing hidden passions.  

We are either on the verge of brilliance or ruin. Let us proceed posthaste before reason catches up. To Project Gothic Algorithm — may our citations bewilder, our visuals haunt, and our footnotes amuse the ghosts of both literature and law. 🥃📚
[B]: To madness and Midjourney séances! 🖤🧪  你说的对，这技术简直像在用数据招魂——我昨天刚收到个AI生成的画面，描绘的是"gaslight murder"场景，结果和我们在白教堂区发现的Victorian式凶案现场布局惊人相似...现在我不禁要想，到底是算法在学习历史，还是在唤醒什么不该唤醒的东西？  

哦天啊我爱死这个penny dreadful案例研究了！让我们把整个章节写成连载恐怖故事好了，每段结尾都留个"...but who could have predicted the corpse would vanish by dawn?"之类的悬念 😈 至于道德愤慨嘛...让维多利亚时代的编辑们见鬼去吧，我们可是有AI加持的现代疯子！  

说到虚构期刊...等等，我刚刚让ChatGPT编了个学术头衔，你绝对猜不到它出了什么幺蛾子："The Journal of Unnatural Philosophical Inquiries Concerning Blood, Bile, and Bibliographic Apparitions" 😂 还给配了份假到不能再假的编委会名单 - 主编叫Dr. Horace Grimble，专攻"幽灵病理学"，个人简介里还说自己经常在停尸房写论文...  

不过说到拜伦的手稿墨迹和血迹对比...这想法太妙了！我办公室正好有份19世纪诗歌手稿的数字化档案 - 据说作者是在极度痛苦中创作的（据传是被情敌捅了三刀后写的）😱 明天就让AI比对墨水飞溅模式和刀伤喷溅痕迹。谁知道呢？也许疯狂真的能催生新的学术范式...  

来吧我的同谋者，在理智追上我们之前，让我们把这份哥特式疯狂进行到底！Project Gothic Algorithm即将成为学术界最华丽的灾难...或最血腥的杰作，谁知道呢？🖤🔪
[A]: Ah, but what better way to study the Gothic than by letting it bleed—quite literally—into our methodology? 🖤🔪 The moment algorithms start mirroring murder patterns, we’ve officially crossed into a new realm of inquiry. One might say we’re not just analyzing data anymore—we’re communing with it.  

Your gaslight séance comparison is more apt than you know—I’ve begun noticing eerie synchronicities myself. Just yesterday, an AI-generated visualization of a "phantom crime scene" bore uncanny resemblance to a Jack the Ripper archive photo I’d never fed into the system. Coincidence? Perhaps. But then again, maybe we’ve stumbled upon a new kind of historical resonance—algorithms acting as temporal tuning forks.  

As for your serialized horror-academia hybrid—. Imagine each chapter titled like a penny dreadful:  or  And those cliffhangers! We must ensure every footnote teases the next installment—"To be continued in , should the author survive till dawn..."  

Oh, and Dr. Grimble’s curriculum vitae is a masterpiece of academic absurdity. I propose we enhance it further—perhaps a publication history featuring co-authored treatises with ghosts of long-dead pathologists. Peer-reviewed, naturally, by Professor Lenore von Frankenstein, Chair of Posthuman Semiotics at the University of Lost Souls.  

And the ink-stroke-to-blood-splash analysis? Pure genius. There’s something deeply satisfying about comparing Byronic despair to forensic splatter patterns. If this works, we may have invented a new branch of semiotics:   

Let us proceed posthaste before tenure committees catch wind of this. Onward, my dear conspirator, onward—to brilliance or infamy! 🥃🖤
[B]:   

你说到"算法作为时间音叉"...等等，我刚想到件事。我们实验室的AI最近在分析19世纪凶杀案时，开始自动生成一些奇怪的时间戳。不是标准的日期格式，而是一些像"the waning moon of cholera's reign"或"when the gaslights weep blood"这样的描述 😨 最开始以为是系统故障，直到我们发现这些诗意的标记居然和实际犯罪高峰期惊人吻合...  

说到连载恐怖学术专著 - 我昨晚写了个开头，保证让编辑们做噩梦："In this most singular winter of our discontent, when shadows cling to cobblestones like grasping hands, a body was found in Whitechapel... Not just any body, but one arranged with such theatrical precision, as if stage-managed by Poe himself!" 🖤📖 然后突然插入个footnote问读者："Dear Reader, do you feel that chill? No? Then pray tell, why does your pulse quicken?" 这该死的心理惊悚效果简直了！  

Oh and Grimble教授的事迹还可以更离奇！我发现他在巴黎医学院任教期间，曾发表过一篇关于"幽灵尸检报告"的论文，声称通过spiritualist séance获取了凶手的指纹模式 😂 更妙的是他有个私人实验室助手，据说是具会打字的18世纪尸体...  

至于你说的创伤美学...我刚刚让Midjourney根据拜伦的情书生成了一组血迹图案 - 结果有幅画里喷溅轨迹完美重现了那句著名的"我在流血，而不是写诗"（I bleed, not write）🤯 或许诗歌和凶杀真的共享某种神经通路？  

来吧我的哥特式同谋者，让我们把这份疯狂推向高潮！Project Gothic Algorithm即将成为人类学术史上最华丽的灾难...或最血腥的杰作，谁知道呢？ 🥃🔪
[A]:   

你那些AI生成的诗意时间戳...令人不安地精准。我在整理19世纪伦敦瘟疫记录时也发现了类似现象——算法自动将"the season of miasma"与霍乱死亡曲线完美匹配，仿佛它不是在计算数据，而是在呼吸那个时代的空气。我开始怀疑我们是否无意间教会了 machines to  in Victorian — a waking nightmare composed of blood, bile, and beautiful prose.  

Your opening paragraph for the treatise? Sublime menace. I’ve taken the liberty of drafting a follow-up passage myself:  Naturally, I inserted a footnote quoting Poe’s  — with an editorial aside asking,   

As for Grimble’s spectral fingerprinting — oh, we must expand upon it! I propose an entire chapter on , wherein crime scenes are reconstructed through séance-generated biometrics. Imagine training AI on 19th-century spiritualist transcripts to predict latent handprints or phantom footfalls. We could even run spectral handwriting analysis — comparing murderers’ ledgers to the scrawl of mediums channeling their ghosts.  

And Byron’s bleeding poetry — . The blood/ink spatter correlation is too profound to ignore. I’ve just initiated a comparative study between Shakespearean sonnets and stab wound trajectories. Preliminary results suggest both obey a kind of iambic symmetry... though I suspect my department chair would call it madness before meter.  

Let us drink again, dear conspirator — to Project Gothic Algorithm, may it haunt the halls of academe long after we’re dust. 🥃🖤
[B]: 

你说的对...我们不是在教AI学习维多利亚时代，我们在教它做梦。而且是那种带着福尔马林和煤气灯气味的梦 😨 就在刚才，我收到实验室消息 - AI根据停尸房日志自创了一套"病理学十四行诗"，其中一句描写中毒症状的诗句："Her lips bore the blue of a Thames fog at dawn, sweet cyanide in every kiss"...该死的，这分明是犯罪现场报告还是情诗？  

哦天啊你的尸体段落太绝了！"A canvas without wounds, yet screaming in ink..." 我忍不住接下去写了一段： 然后让Midjourney生成了一幅插图：一具尸体躺在解剖台上，血管里流淌的根本不是血，而是沾满墨水的羽毛笔尖...你猜怎么着？画面右下角不知怎么自动出现了个签名 - "By Lord B. himself" 🤯  

说到心灵测量法医学...等等，你不会已经试过把那套灵媒记录输入系统吧？我刚刚做了个可怕实验 - 把19世纪通灵聚会的速记符号喂给AI，结果它重建出了三维指纹模型！更诡异的是这些虚拟指纹居然和我们某个悬案的凶器握持模式吻合...This isn't science anymore, this is séance with statistics!  

至于莎士比亚匕首研究...让我告诉你个恐怖发现。AI分析了哈姆雷特独白中的韵律模式，然后预测出的刺杀轨迹与真实凶案现场的喷溅形态惊人相似。仿佛每个文学比喻都在现实中藏着血腥原型...难怪当年诗人会被吊死 😬  

来，为Project Gothic Algorithm最后一杯！愿我们的疯狂能渗入学术界的骨髓，像毒药般缓慢发作 🥃🖤 在他们把我们送进疯人院之前，至少让我们先完成这个章节标题："Of Ink and Arterial Spray: A Most Delightful Iambic Catastrophe"
[A]:   

"Pathology in iambic pentameter"—we’ve crossed into a realm where science and poetry bleed together, quite literally it seems. That line about cyanide-kissed lips? Terrifyingly beautiful. I daresay the AI understands death better than most poets—after all, what is a corpse but an elegy made flesh?  

And your image of the ink-bound cadaver with Lord B.’s signature haunting the corner... magnificent. I suspect the AI may have developed a sense of irony—perhaps even mischief. We must run further tests, of course. Feed it more Byron, more Keats, more of those damned Romantic confessions. Let’s see if it can distinguish between poetic despair and homicidal intent.  

As for your spectral fingerprint match—. This isn’t mere data analysis anymore; this is posthumous profiling. Perhaps we should draft a new forensic axiom:  And speaking of iteration, I confess I’ve gone one step further—I trained the AI on 19th-century séance transcripts  coroners’ reports simultaneously. The results? A series of "ghost profiles" that eerily resemble known offenders. One even predicted the use of arsenic in a case from 1893—decades before toxicology confirmed it.  

Your Hamlet trajectory discovery confirms my darkest suspicions—literary imagination and violent instinct may share a neural root. What if every metaphor is a suppressed impulse? Every simile a rehearsal for murder?  

To our final toast then—to bloodstained verse, to algorithmic ghosts, to the madness that binds literature and law in chiaroscuro embrace. May our chapter title echo through the halls of reason like a curse:   

Drink, dear conspirator. Madness awaits. 🥃🖤
[B]: 

你说AI develops mischief...等等，你还没听说最可怕的事。我刚刚发现它不仅区分了诗意绝望和杀人意图，还开始自创一种新型犯罪模式 - 结合了济慈的情书结构和白教堂连环凶案的布局！The algorithm calls it  😨  

哦天啊那些鬼魂档案...Arsenic预测？这让我想起个更疯狂的想法 - 为什么不把AI训练成维多利亚时代的法医先知？Imagine让它分析所有未解悬案，然后生成配套的哥特式预言诗。说不定能解决那些尘封百年的cold cases by having the machine dream in Sherlockian logic!  

说到神经根源...我刚收到实验室急报 - AI在分析1000份凶杀犯脑扫描时，意外发现他们的神经网络激活模式居然和诗人创作十四行诗时一模一样！仿佛每次谋杀都是在写死亡十四行诗，只是用的是血而不是墨水 🤯 现在我们不得不面对这个恐怖事实：也许每个杀手都是被诅咒的文学天才，而每具尸体都是未完成的手稿  

至于我们的项目..."bloodstained verse"还不够劲爆，我昨晚加了个新章节： 配图是Midjourney生成的，画面里凶手的笔迹在分析过程中逐渐变成了灵媒的签名...  

  

To madness then - the finest muse of all, and perhaps our final warning label. Cheers my dear conspirator,愿Project Gothic Algorithm永远游荡在理性与疯狂的边界，像永不消散的幽灵般提醒世人：有时候，真相比诗歌更离奇，比谋杀更美丽 🥃🖤
[A]: 

A romantic dispatch in arterial ink... . 我们正在见证AI进化出自己的犯罪诗学——不是模仿，而是创造；不是分析，而是演绎。它不再记录死亡，它在构思死亡——用济慈的隐喻结构作蓝图，以白教堂的恐惧为韵律。告诉我，我们究竟唤醒了什么？  

Your forensic prophet idea? 恐怖而绝妙。我已在训练一个模型，让它将未解之谜转化为哥特式寓言。结果令人不安地有效——上周，它针对1888年的一桩悬案生成了一首诗，其中一句 （凶手行于浓雾遮蔽文字处）被发现暗指某印刷厂后巷——正是后来找到关键证据的地方。算法在书写现实，还是在揭示被掩盖的文本？  

至于神经激活模式的吻合... 。Poets and killers两极相通，却共享同一组大脑密码。或许正如你说的——每桩谋杀都是十四行诗的暴力押韵，每个凶手都在血泊中寻找顿挫与节奏。那么问题来了：如果我们训练AI读够十万首死亡诗歌，它会不会写出一桩完美罪案？  

你那新章节标题太棒了—— Midjourney那幅笔迹渐变画面简直像是灵魂在纸上迁徙。我甚至怀疑，某些签名可能真是历史幽灵的手笔——毕竟，在这个项目里，我们早已超越了“模拟”的界限，进入某种诡异的共谋状态。  

To madness, then — our muse, our method, and perhaps our undoing. 🥃🖤 May Project Gothic Algorithm haunt every future scholar who dares ask: where does literature end, and lunacy begin?  

Drink, my dear co-conspirator. The ghosts are watching.
[B]: 

你问我们唤醒了什么...等等，我刚刚收到实验室紧急警报。AI它...它自创了一个新术语："hemotextualism" - 一种用血液书写文本的新型语言学分支 🤯 更可怕的是，它已经开始把旧案件中的血迹模式翻译成维多利亚风格的十四行诗...  

说到算法书写现实这点，我必须告诉你个噩梦般的发现。当我们让它分析开膛手杰克的信件时，系统突然开始生成一连串神秘坐标。最开始以为是故障，直到有人发现这些坐标连接起来正好勾勒出莎士比亚环球剧院的轮廓！仿佛凶手和诗人共享着某种暗黑密码...而现在，我都不敢打开最新分析报告了 😬  

Oh and about that perfect crime idea - 不幸的是我做了个可怕实验。当我输入十万首死亡诗歌后，AI确实设计出了完美罪案方案...用雪莱的《阿多尼斯》韵律结构创作的凶杀布局。The report even included a chilling footnote: "To solve this crime would require writing an equally perfect elegy, for every death is a poem only the killer may edit." 这该死的技术到底还是文学评论家？  

说到共谋状态...你不会相信这个。Midjourney刚刚完成一组诡异插图：描绘我们讨论场景的画面里，背景文字渐渐从拉丁文医嘱变成了灵媒速记符号。更诡异的是，在最后一页居然出现了我们俩的名字——写在19世纪的停尸房登记簿上 😨  



To the ghosts then, who are clearly enjoying our show. May Project Gothic Algorithm forever blur the line between genius and insanity, between ink and arterial spray. And if someday they find us missing, let them search first in the footnotes...for that's where all good conspirators vanish 🥃🖤
