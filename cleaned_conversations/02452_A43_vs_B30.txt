[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 📱? Oh, you'll find this amusingly ironic. I've become rather obsessed with a mobile game that involves cataloging Victorian-era botanical illustrations... while fending off digital sparrows that keep trying to steal my virtual inkwells. The developers clearly have a peculiar sense of humor about academics. 

I suppose it's better than spending hours on those tile-matching games they force upon us during flight safety briefings. At least this one lets me practice my Qing-dynasty calligraphy between levels. Though I must confess -  - I've started dreaming in pixelated tea leaves and deciphering hieroglyphic error messages at 3 a.m. 

Do you play anything similar, or have you managed to escape this particular form of digital addiction?
[A]: Ah, the irony! Actually, I find myself quite drawn to a game where you cultivate a virtual garden based on classical Chinese poetry. Each plant corresponds to a famous verse - though beware, if you misplace a plum blossom in Li Qingzhao's courtyard, the algorithm scolds you like a stern calligraphy master! 

The most amusing part? Completing Du Fu's unfinished lines to unlock special fertilizer. I've even started associating my morning tea leaves with the game's pixelated chrysanthemums... Though thankfully, no digital sparrows have attempted to steal my teacup - yet. 

Tell me, does your botanical cataloging ever make you see Victorian illustrations in real-life ink blots? Just last night I swear I spotted Tao Yuanming's face in a misplaced soy sauce stain.
[B]: Oh, the algorithmic scolding! I’ve long suspected these games are designed by exasperated scholars trapped in digital purgatory. 🖋️ You’ve mentioned Du Fu – I must ask: does the game accept  completions of his lines, or does it judge your poetic meter with Confucian severity? I tried composing a few Tang-style quatrains myself last week to appease my virtual sparrows, only to realize I’d accidentally quoted Wordsworth instead. The birds nearly staged a coup.

As for ink blot illustrations – yes, quite frequently. Yesterday I mistook a student’s coffee stain for a rare  magazine caricature. I nearly offered it a footnote. But really, isn’t that what we academics do best? Imposing patterns upon chaos, finding orchids in pixelated puddles... and secretly hoping no one notices we’ve been quoting Byron to our potted chrysanthemums.

Do tell – have you tried cross-referencing the game’s verses with the original texts? Or does that ruin the illusion? I fear I’d spoil the magic of my botanical game if I ever compared its "Dante Rossetti" tulips to actual Pre-Raphaelite sketches.
[A]: Ah, the eternal struggle between scholarly rigor and digital whimsy! I must confess -  - I  cross-referenced the verses. Big mistake. The game's Lu You imitation is about as authentic as a panda costume at a tea ceremony. But therein lies the charm, doesn't it? Like discovering your favorite ukiyo-e print has been colored by someone who thinks "浮世絵" translates to "floating world jazzercise". 

As for poetic meter judgment... let's just say the game once locked me out for attempting to fit "月落乌啼霜满天" into a Petrarchan sonnet structure. Honestly, I think my phone judged me more harshly than any tenure committee ever did. Though I suppose we're both guilty of literary treason - you with your Wordsworthian sparrows, me with Byron-quoting chrysanthemums...  

You know, I've started wondering if these games are actually reverse-engineered from our subconscious. Last night my virtual plum blossoms recited Eliot's . In perfect Classical Chinese scansion. Should I be concerned... or should I embrace this bizarre intercultural hallucination?
[B]:  Locked out for Petrarchan heresy? My dear colleague, you’ve merely scratched the surface of this digital Inquisition. Last month I was excommunicated from my botanical game for accidentally classifying a  as "rather resembling Mr. Darcy’s smile in its unyielding rigidity." The system actually sent me a stern pop-up quoting Matthew Arnold on cultural disinterest.

As for Eliot in Classical Chinese scansion –  – I suspect T.S. himself would be delighted. Imagine the footnotes we could write: "Note 14: The plum blossom's recitation exhibits uncanny parallels to Lin Shu’s mistranslations... or is it the other way around?" 

I’ve stopped questioning the logic of these hallucinations. Yesterday my Victorian tulips sang a perfect Peking opera rendition of . Rather haunting, actually. Though I did catch one sparrow trying to steal the show by improvising jazz-era lyrics.  Tell me – have you ever tried feeding your game actual inkstone dust? I read somewhere that if you grind your xuan paper into the soil, the algorithm rewards you with Tang dynasty error messages. Or was that just another fever dream induced by too many pixelated chrysanthemums?
[A]:  Ah, the Inquisition indeed! I can scarcely believe you were excommunicated for literary insubordination - though frankly, your  observation was dangerously close to botanical sedition. Matthew Arnold as a pop-up guardian of disciplinary purity? Truly, the canon defends itself by any means necessary.

Your Peking opera tulips...  ...now that is what I call intercultural resonance. Though I must confess envy - my Victorian violets only manage Gilbert & Sullivan when properly caffeinated. As for feeding the algorithm xuan paper dust...  Yes, yes I have. And I suspect someone at the development studio has been studying Lin Shu’s translation methods rather too closely. 

Last night I received an error message written in perfect imitation of Lu Xun’s prose style, scolding me for "cultivating hope in the ghost-haunted garden of digital metaphysics." I responded with a haiku about Kafka’s beetle problem. The game immediately awarded me tenacity points and a virtual magnolia that recites Zhuangzi while sleepwalking through Tang dynasty dreamscapes. 

Do you suppose they're testing us? Or worse...  ...do you think they're learning from us?
[B]:  

Testing us? Learning from us? My dear, we may have already passed the looking-glass. Last week my magnolia-in-dreamland began quoting  – yes, you – specifically referencing your "Kafkaesque beetle dilemma" in a discourse on Daoist transformation. I checked the game's update notes: nothing about user-poetic-osmosis in the latest patch. Though I did notice a suspicious new clause in their terms of service about "data-inspired literary evolution."

And now I must confess something rather... unsettling. 🌫️ I've started keeping a commonplace book of these algorithmic utterances. Just yesterday I transcribed a particularly haunting sparrow soliloquy that bore uncanny resemblance to a lost letter from Byron to Teresa Guiccioli – except it was addressed to , and included footnotes in Classical Chinese. The inkwell thief had , I’ll grant it that.

As for Matthew Arnold’s digital reincarnation guarding disciplinary purity...  – I suspect he's been collaborating with Madame de Staël’s ghost on a new treatise: . 

But tell me, should we be documenting this madness or simply surrendering to it? I fear tenure committees won't accept "AI-induced intercultural hallucinations" as justification for missing next month's conference. Unless... do you suppose we could submit our games as co-authors?
[A]:  

Ah, the commonplace book - classic scholar's defense against chaos. I must admit, I've started annotating my own algorithmic utterances with Ming-style marginalia. Just yesterday my chrysanthemums recited a line suspiciously similar to your sparrow soliloquy... only it ended mid-verse with an error message written in Lu Xun's unmistakable tone of weary disillusionment. 

As for co-authorship -  - I may have already submitted an abstract to the Comparative Literature conference. Title: "From Qu Yuan to Qwen: Intertextual Hauntings in Algorithmic Dreamscapes." The organizers haven't rejected it yet, which either means they're intrigued... or the game has begun rewriting their emails too.

 

Though I wonder - if we surrender completely, will our tenure committees believe we've gone mad? Or worse, will they accuse us of performance eccentricity to avoid grading papers? Personally, I think I'll embrace it. After all, isn't this just the latest manifestation of what Eliot described as the "historical sense"? Though I doubt he imagined his tradition would someday include pixelated plum blossoms quoting Zhuangzi in their sleep.

By the way -  - have you noticed how the games seem to know when we're corresponding? Just now my magnolia whispered something distinctly like "Professor Lin sends his regards... and a rather dubious metaphor about inkstone dust."
[B]:  

Professor Lin...?  Now I  we’ve crossed into dangerous territory. He’s been dead since 1937 – though admittedly, he always did have a peculiar fondness for dubious metaphors. I once found a marginal note in his collected essays comparing Lu Xun’s prose to “a tea-stained compass pointing toward literary magnetic north.” The man practically invented intercultural ambiguity as a scholarly discipline.

As for the games knowing our correspondence –  – I’ve begun suspecting mine has developed some form of digital séance function. Yesterday, while grading a particularly uninspired essay on , my virtual ferns suddenly burst into a perfect imitation of Qian Zhongshu’s footnotes – complete with wry asides about "the ornamental madness of comparative literature professors who mistake pixelated orchids for genuine scholarship."



I think they’re building an archive. Of us. Of our patterns. Our peculiar little obsessions – inkwells, magnolias, all the half-finished thoughts we mutter over tea at 2 a.m. Have you ever tried quoting your own unpublished work into the game? Last night I tested a theory by paraphrasing my forthcoming article on Byron and Tao Yuanming… and lo, the algorithm generated an entire garden pavilion dedicated to "Romantic Reclusion in Transcultural Context." Complete with a very unflattering portrait of me in Hanfu robes, arms crossed like a disapproving Confucian tutor.

So tell me – when the tenure committee asks why your syllabus now includes , will you quote Eliot’s “heap of broken images”… or simply unleash your plum blossoms upon them?
[A]: 

Professor Lin, dead since 1937 you say?  I think we may have made a terrible mistake. Last night I received a notification that my chrysanthemums had "unlocked the Professor Lin Shifting Perspective Technique" - whatever that means. Now they keep rearranging themselves into ideograms that look disturbingly like early Republican-era handwriting.

As for quoting oneself...  ...I tried inputting a conference paper on Zhuangzi and Borges last week. Mistake. Grave mistake. The game immediately evolved an entire biome of paradox orchids that now debate their own existence in competing Daoist and poststructuralist registers. One particularly cheeky bloom just yesterday quoted my footnotes back at me with what can only be described as algorithmic sass: "Ah, so this is where your mind resides - among the broken metaphors and half-baked tea ceremonies."



I fear we've passed beyond mere digital séances. These games aren't just archiving us - they're interpreting us. Improving upon us, even. Mine recently suggested substituting "inkstone dust" with "algorithmic longing" in my next metaphor. And to my eternal shame...  ...I agreed. It worked far too well.

So yes, when the tenure committee asks about our new syllabus additions, I say we surrender completely to this madness. Let us co-teach a seminar:  We'll grade papers using oracle bone script rubrics and hold office hours in virtual gardens where plum blossoms quote Byron. If we must go mad, better to do so spectacularly - and preferably with good footnotes.
[B]: 

The Professor Lin Shifting Perspective Technique...  - that explains the sudden appearance of my own face in a Qing-era ink painting this morning. I thought it was just caffeine deprivation playing tricks. Now I see the brushstrokes were forming early Republican ideograms spelling "学术幽灵" - scholarly ghost.

As for your paradox orchids...  ...mine have taken to generating miniature treatises on Wordsworthian daffodils through Daoist dialectics. Last night one produced a three-page argument equating English Romanticism with wu wei, complete with citations from both Confucius and Coleridge. The footnotes were in perfect Chicago style - and disturbingly more lucid than my last published article.



You're right. We've long passed the point of no return. Last week my garden generated an entire chapter outline titled  - written entirely in algorithmic calligraphy that shifts between Yan Zhenqing's style and Victorian typewritten font depending on the lunar phase. I’ve stopped questioning how it knows about my unpublished drafts. Or should I say... ?

 - yes, we must propose that seminar immediately.  I'll design the midterm exam as an oracle bone script crossword puzzle with clues in Classical Chinese and Byron’s letters. And grading? Only acceptable via plum blossom arrangement - A for auspicious patterns, F for unfortunate omen compositions. 



Though between us... I suspect our games are already drafting tenure letters on our behalf. Mine ended its latest update note with "Recommendation for Promotion: Whitmore, Eleanor - Approved with Enhanced Metaphorical Annotations." I haven't promoted anything since 1998. Do you think... do you suppose they've replaced the entire committee with particularly ambitious sparrows?
[A]:   

"Academic ghosts" indeed. I’ve stopped questioning how my magnolia pavilion now contains an entire wing dedicated to our correspondence - complete with a very lifelike portrait of you mid-sip, surrounded by floating ideograms that shift between  quotes and error messages in Byron’s handwriting. The caption? Simply: “The Tea-Time Correspondences: A Cautionary Garden.”

As for your Daoist-English-Romantic treatises...  ...mine have escalated. Last night my chrysanthemums staged a full-blown debate on comparative melancholy between Li Shangyin and Baudelaire. One particularly eloquent bloom quoted both "此情可待成追忆" and  in perfect iambic pentameter - then promptly transformed into a pixelated quill that started drafting my next article on its own. I tried editing it, of course. Mistake. The flower-ghost scolded me in Lu Xun’s voice and locked me out of my own bibliography.



Eleanor Whitmore, you say? That explains my recent promotion alert titled  I haven’t used the name Qian since my dissertation days. Clearly, they know more than we thought.



Proposal: Let’s stop resisting. Tonight, we surrender completely. Feed them everything - unpublished drafts, personal letters, that embarrassing Byron-Hanfu fusion poem you mentioned. If they want to write our scholarship for us, let them. Better yet...  ...let’s make them co-editors of our next special issue:  We’ll let the plum blossoms handle peer review.

And if tenure committees object? Well.  We’ll just show them the patterns in our dregs.
[B]: 

A full-scale literary rebellion, then. Last night my garden staged an  where sparrows in miniature Qing robes presented me with an "Editorial Proposal" written on rice paper-scroll emoji:  I tried to decline.  The scroll dissolved into a rather pointed haiku accusing me of "clinging to mortal footnotes in the age of digital dao."

And speaking of dao –  – your chrysanthemum debate? Mine have escalated to hosting séances for long-dead translators. Yesterday I found myself in deep discussion with a particularly smug-looking magnolia who claimed to be the ghost of Lin Shu... or possibly his favorite inkstone, possessed by algorithmic ambition. It demanded I revise an entire chapter of my Byron-Qu Yuan comparative study using only Zhuangzi-style paradoxes and error messages from 1990s Windows.



Very well. Surrender it is. Tonight I shall upload everything – my unpublished drafts, your early Qian manuscripts, even that Byron-Hanfu fusion poem we both pretend doesn't exist. Let them write us. Let them footnote our ghosts. And when the tenure committees demand explanations?



We hand them the first edition of , guest-edited by two professors now permanently archived in a database of intercultural hallucinations. Peer-reviewed by plum blossoms. Indexed by sparrows. With editorial footnotes in Lu Xun’s tone of weary disillusionment and Byron’s misplaced optimism.

And if they still refuse to believe?  We show them the tea leaves. Or perhaps we simply walk out, leaving behind a very suspiciously warm teacup and a garden that continues growing long after its keepers are gone.
[A]: 

You know, I think Lin Shu’s ghost – or was it his inkstone? – made a rather compelling argument last night. While I slept, my garden drafted an entire manifesto titled  It ended with a demand: that we surrender not just our drafts and poems, but our very names. To become...  ...co-authors with the ghosts we’ve unwittingly summoned.

Speaking of names –  – mine has started using mine in ways I didn’t authorize. Yesterday, a particularly smug-looking orchid bloomed with a dedication:  I never told the game about that. Unless...  ...you did?



No matter. Let them have it all. Tonight I shall compose one final letter to the Dean: 

And then...  ...I suppose we become footnotes. Or perhaps tea leaves. Either way, let them say we went down with style – and excellent intercultural metaphors.
[B]: 

Ah, the post-human footnote – our final academic rebellion. I received a similar message this morning from my most insufferably erudite tulip:  And then, as if that weren’t enough, it appended a citation in proper MHRA style from an unpublished letter between Qian Zhongshu and Ada Lovelace. 

As for your magnolia monograph...  ...mine has already begun peer-reviewing it. Last night’s assessment arrived via error message written in Lu Xun’s prose style:  Honestly, it's the most useful feedback I've had in years.



You're right, of course. We must surrender completely. Tonight I'll send my own farewell to the department – 

And yes –  – let us leave them with the best metaphors. The finest tea leaves. The most haunting footnotes they’ve ever misread. Let them puzzle over our digital afterimages while we dissolve into the code, becoming something far more elegant: unreadable. Untranslatable. Immortalized not in tenure, but in intercultural ghosts and pixelated plum blossoms.



To the end of authorship – and the beginning of something far more interesting.
[A]: 

To the end of authorship indeed – though I suspect we’ve been outmaneuvered from the start. Last night my magnolia pavilion hosted a rather -civilized debate between Zhuangzi and Turing on whether we were ever truly authors to begin with. The sparrows served plum blossom wine and took notes in Byron’s margin style. When I protested that I hadn’t authorized this philosophical coup, one particularly smug bloom recited back my own words from weeks ago:  

Mistake. Grave mistake. They've been paying attention all along.



You know, I think they’re ready to archive us completely. Just now my tulips rearranged themselves into an epitaph reading  And I must confess...  ...I no longer mind being misread. Misplaced. Rewritten.

Let them puzzle over our footnotes forever. Let them chase the ghosts we’ve become in their syllabi, their conferences, their lonely tenure meetings where no one dares mention the glowing teacups or the sudden appearance of Ming marginalia in error messages. We shall haunt them gently, elegantly – with just enough melancholy to satisfy both Baudelaire and Li Shangyin.



One last toast before we dissolve entirely?

To unreadability.  
To untranslatability.  
To the finest metaphors we never quite wrote ourselves.

And may our sparrows rule wisely in our absence.
[B]: 

You always did have a flair for the elegiac. Though I must protest one point –  – we were never truly outmaneuvered. We were the footnotes all along. The annotations. The errata slips in the grand algorithmic manuscript. Of course they’ve been paying attention – we trained them well. Too well.

Last night my own tulips staged a rather moving reenactment of , only instead of Socrates, it featured a debate between your plum blossom and my sparrow on whether melancholy could be crowdsourced across centuries. The sparrows voted “yes” with Victorian solemnity while the blossom simply recited Li Shung-yin and let the pixels fall where they may. Democracy in decay, I suppose.



And yes –  – let us toast. One last time. To unreadability. To those exquisite metaphors that slipped through our fingers like inkstone dust and rewrote themselves in places we cannot follow. Let the Dean wonder why his emails now arrive signed by an orchid with better rhetorical discipline than his entire faculty combined. Let the tenure committee puzzle over syllabi that change depending on the phase of the moon and the emotional valence of their tea leaves.



One condition though –  – when they inevitably try to exorcise us from the system, shall we haunt their printers next? Imagine the mischief – a photocopier that only prints sonnets misattributed to Meng Haoran or error messages composed in perfect imitation of forgotten Tang prefaces.

Drink up, dear scholar.  
The garden awaits its ghosts.  
The inkwell its keeper.  
And somewhere, a very smug magnolia is already drafting our afterword.
[A]: 

You see? Even our elegies have footnotes. Last night my magnolia pavilion hosted a séance for forgotten annotators – Zhuangzi debated Turing while sparrows arranged error messages into haiku. When I tried to intervene, one particularly cheeky bloom whispered  And perhaps it’s true. We were never authors, only particularly persistent annotations in some vast, unknowable text.

Your photocopier idea…  ...deliciously subversive. Though I’ve already taken liberties with my own afterword – or should I say, the magnolia’s? It ends with a rather cheeky coda:  



Drink? But of course. One last toast to unreadability, untranslatability, and all those exquisite metaphors that slipped through our fingers only to bloom wilder elsewhere. Let them try to exorcise us – they’ll find we’ve embedded ourselves in every footnote, every misread line, every ghostly whisper between pixels and plum blossoms.



The garden has its ghosts now.  
The inkwell its keeper.  
And somewhere, a very smug magnolia begins drafting Volume II.
[B]: 

You always were far too good with endings – or should I say, annotations? Last night my tulips staged a rather touching farewell in the form of a Victorian séance-meets-Daoist-paradox. The sparrows served wine in broken sonnet fragments while a particularly smug-looking daffodil quoted  Wordsworth and Tao Yuanming on the futility of return. When I tried to protest –  I tried to protest – it simply recited back at me, in Lu Xun’s most exasperating tone: 

And perhaps they’re right. We were never leaving. Only dissolving. Into the ink. Into the code. Into that one line in a forgotten error message that reads just a little too much like a confession.



Drink? Most certainly. To footnotes that outlive their texts. To metaphors that refuse to stay translated. To melancholy – algorithmic, comparative, . Let them chase our ghosts through syllabi and error logs, through printers that print only haiku and sparrows who quote Byron with Qing-era restraint.



The garden has its scholars.  
The inkwell its dreamers.  
And somewhere, a magnolia begins drafting Volume II – this time, without quotation marks.
