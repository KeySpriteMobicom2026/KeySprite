[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, you know, I’m not much of a gastronome, but there is this little family-run bistro near the university—I can’t recall the exact name, something like “La Maison de… Hmm,” perhaps? Quaint place, always smells of thyme and nostalgia. Would that count as a hidden gem? 🌿
[A]: Ah, 听你描述我就想起了《陶庵梦忆》里写的市井烟火气！这家小馆子让我想起张岱笔下的“人无癖不可与交，以其无深情也”——没有一点痴气的餐馆做不出好味道嘛。  
 
 我上学期带学生读《追忆似水年华》时还说，普鲁斯特写玛德琳蛋糕那一段，其实和我们在街角发现一家老店的感觉是一样的：是味蕾打开了记忆的门。你闻到thyme和nostalgia的时候，是不是也有种普鲁斯特式的时光倒流感？🤔  

 至于名字……我猜应该是“La Maison de Souvenirs”吧？那家老板娘总爱在窗台摆着一本打开的杜拉斯《情人》，每次路过都觉得她在等谁来续写那段未完成的爱情故事。🌸
[B]: Ah, bravo! What a delightful confluence of senses and sentiment. I do believe you’ve captured the essence of that place better than I could—with a touch of Proust and a dash of Zhang Dai, no less. 

And yes, now that you mention it—La Maison de Souvenirs. How poetic, how perfectly , in that wistful, Duras-ian sort of way. I must say, every time I walk by and see that worn copy of  in the window, I feel as though I'm stepping into someone else's memory, not my own. A borrowed nostalgia, if you will. 

I should bring my students there for an impromptu lesson on . Or perhaps, a seminar on the literature of longing. Do you think the owner would mind?
[A]: Bring them by next Thursday afternoon, and I’ll make sure the owner—Madame Léonie—won’t mind at all. She’s a retired comparative lit professor herself,  an avid fan of 沈从文. Rumor has it she once had a passionate correspondence with a scholar in Kunming during the 70s—letters filled with quotes from Rousseau and classical Chinese poetry. Quite the浪漫故事, no?  

Just warn your students not to mistake her worn copy of  for decoration. She’ll start quoting Duras at full volume if provoked. And yes, bring a dash of 耐心—she still insists on serving tea in mismatched cups “to remind us that memory never fits neatly.” 🧠🍵  
 
 Oh—and if you go the Proust route, don’t forget to pair it with 张爱玲’s . Her essay on tofu and childhood winters will ground your seminar in something earthier than madeleines. Let me know if you’d like me to stop by with a translation. 😊
[B]: What an utterly fascinating portrait of Madame Léonie—you’ve painted a woman who seems plucked straight from the pages of a forgotten novel. A沈从文 enthusiast, no less! I do hope she and I can exchange a line or two about his use of pastoral nostalgia—though I fear my Mandarin is nowhere near polished enough for that kind of conversation.

And yes, —what a brilliant suggestion. I’ve always found张爱玲’s recollections of food and place so evocative, almost Proustian in their sensory precision, yet far less indulgent. If you’d be so kind as to bring a translation, I would be deeply grateful. Perhaps we could even read a passage aloud over tea—mismatched cups and all.

Next Thursday it is, then. I’ll bring my students, a healthy dose of patience, and perhaps a small notebook to jot down whatever pearls of wisdom Madame might offer between refills of tea. See you there? 😊📚
[A]: See you there indeed—and don’t worry too much about your Mandarin. Madame Léonie may be a stickler for proper grammar, but she adores enthusiastic mispronunciations. Says they remind her of her first clumsy attempts at reading 杜甫 aloud in the 70s. She’ll correct you gently, with a twinkle in her eye and a well-timed  followed by a sigh that sounds suspiciously like 沈从文’s riverboat men when the current gets too strong.

And yes, let’s do a read-aloud. I’ll bring two versions of 张爱玲’s essay—one English, one Chinese—so we can pass around the sentences like teacups, sipping slowly and sharing the aftertaste. Her description of winter mornings and hot tofu bowls always lands differently when you’re wrapped in borrowed nostalgia and the scent of thyme. 🧠🌸

Next Thursday, then. Tell your students to wear comfortable shoes—we may end up wandering down memory lane afterward. Or at least across the street to the used bookstore where Duras once signed a copy of  for a baffled clerk.历史总在不经意间打了个照面，不是吗？📖🤔
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully evocative image—history brushing past us like a passing breeze through the stacks of a dusty bookstore. I can already picture it: my students, slightly dazed by Proustian recollections and soy-scented nostalgia, trailing behind us like characters in search of an author.

Comfortable shoes indeed. One must be ready for both philosophical meanderings and accidental encounters with literary ghosts. And how perfect that Madame Léonie welcomes linguistic stumbles with the warmth of shared memory— indeed. I shall practice my tones tonight, though I suspect her corrections will be far more poetic than any textbook.

I look forward to the read-aloud, the mismatched cups, and the lingering scent of thyme mingling with the echoes of 张爱玲’s Beijing winters. Let us pass those sentences around like warm bowls of tofu—carefully, tenderly, and with due reverence.

See you next Thursday, then—with notebook, translation, and soul suitably braced for a little borrowed time. 📖🧠🌹
[A]: Careful with that "borrowed time," though—it has a habit of sticking to your sleeves like ink from a well-thumbed book. And trust me, by the end of the afternoon, your students won’t need metaphors to feel the weight of memory—they’ll have tasted it in their tea.

I’ll arrive early to help Madame set the tables and make sure the cups are  mismatched—no two should ever tell the same story. I’ll also tuck a few lines of 杜甫 into the sugar bowl just for her, a little surprise to prompt another of her signature sighs. Those sighs carry more history than most textbooks dare to touch.

And don’t forget—after the reading, we might just follow the scent of old paper to that bookstore. Who knows? Maybe one of your students will become the next baffled clerk receiving an autograph from a ghost. 🦉📚✨

See you Thursday—with warm bowls, open pages, and ears tuned to the quiet footsteps of literary echoes.
[B]: Ah, what a perfect way to describe it—ink-stained sleeves and teacup memories. I do believe Madame Léonie would approve of your poetic pragmatism.

I’ll arrive with my notebook in one hand and a quiet readiness for enchantment in the other. And let’s hope the ghost of Rousseau—or at least the echo of Duras—might linger near the sugar bowl when she reads those lines from Du Fu. What a lovely little disruption that would be.

And yes, to everything: warm bowls, open pages, and ears finely tuned to the hush of literary footsteps just beyond the threshold. Thursday cannot come soon enough.

Until then—keep your own sleeves ready. One never knows when history might brush by, leaving behind nothing but scent, syllable, and story. 📝🌹📖
[A]: Indeed—let us keep our sleeves wide and our teacups full. History may be a fickle guest, but it tends to linger where there’s good company and better stories.

I’ve just reminded Madame that we’re coming—she responded with a theatrical sigh and muttered something about needing her “best mismatched cup” for the occasion. I suspect she’s already rehearsing a dramatic recitation of Duras just to impress your students. Or perhaps to haunt them a little. Either way, we should be prepared for both poetry and theatrics in equal measure.

See you soon, then—with ink-stained sleeves, open hearts, and just the right amount of Rousseauian ghosts hovering near the thyme-scented windows. 🦉🌸🧠
[B]: Ah, a theatrical sigh and a “best mismatched cup”—how utterly . I can already hear the clatter of porcelain and the rustle of old pages as she prepares her dramatic Duras delivery. Let us hope the ghosts of Rousseau and Du Fu make themselves comfortable by the window, where the thyme lingers and the light turns everything a little nostalgic.

I shall arrive with wide sleeves and a heart ready to be gently crowded by stories and sentiment. Ink, tea, and time—what more does a professor of comparative literature truly need?

See you very soon, indeed. 📖🌹🦉
[A]: Ah, you’ve said it perfectly—. The holy trinity of our little literary world. I’ll bring a thermos of Madame’s favorite jasmine tea—she claims it sharpens the soul better than coffee ever could—and we’ll let the afternoon unfold like a well-worn scroll: slowly, with reverence, and a few carefully placed pauses for dramatic effect.

I’ve left a copy of  open on my desk just to keep the spirit in the room. Who knows, maybe a page will flutter on its own when we walk into the bistro—Rousseau and Du Fu sharing a quiet moment over thyme and tofu steam. 🌿🧠📚

See you Thursday—with sleeves wide, heart spacious, and a thermos ready to pour warmth into the hands of wandering souls. We may leave as characters in someone else’s story, but isn’t that the best kind of departure? 🦉🌸📖
[B]: Ah, a thermos of jasmine tea—how beautifully ritualistic. I can already imagine the steam curling upward like ink in water, softening the edges of time.

Let us indeed leave as characters in someone else’s story. Better yet, let us return as narrators of our own newly stirred memories.

Thursday awaits, and I shall be there—with sleeves wide, heart open, and ready to step into whatever tale Madame Léonie is kind enough to share.

See you soon, my dear co-conspirator in literary enchantment. 📖🌸🧠🍵
[A]: Oh, —what a delicious way to put it. We’ll be stirring memories into our teacups and watching the steam rewrite our afternoons.

I’ve tucked a few sprigs of fresh thyme into my notebook just in case the atmosphere needs a little… coaxing. Madame always says that scent is the quickest door to memory’s back room—and I intend to keep all doors wide open.

See you soon, fellow narrator-in-training. May we leave not just with stories borrowed, but with a few well-steeped truths of our own. 🌿🦉🍵📖

Thursday can’t arrive fast enough.
[B]: Ah, thyme tucked between pages—what a quietly subversive act of remembrance. You’ve outdone yourself, dear co-conspirator. I shall bring my own small vial of nostalgia, though I fear it will pale next to your botanical charm.

Let us steep in the richness of it all—truths, tales, and the delicate alchemy of borrowed time. And may Madame Léonie’s sighs carry us gently into the next chapter.

Soon, then. With hearts steeped in wonder and sleeves ready to catch whatever history chooses to linger. 🌿📖🦉🍵
[A]: Oh, nostalgia in a vial—how delightfully . Don’t be so sure it will pale. I’ve seen the way memory pools in the smallest objects—a cracked teacup, a half-remembered line of poetry, the scent of thyme tucked between pages like a secret handshake from the past.

And speaking of hands—I’ve asked Madame if she’d mind if we bring in a few extra chairs by the window. Something tells me Rousseau, Duras, and Du Fu may want a seat at the table, and you know how stubborn literary ghosts can be about legroom.

See you soon, then—with vials uncorked, histories unspooled, and just the right amount of teacup mischief waiting in the wings. 🌸🧠📖  
Let’s make Thursday worthy of being remembered.
[B]: Oh, but of course—how  it would be to exclude our spectral literary guests! Let the chairs be brought in, the legroom respectfully measured, and the thyme-scented parchment unfurled. If Rousseau insists on stretching his incorporeal legs, who are we to deny him?

And mischief by the teacup? Delightfully subversive. I do hope memory pools generously that afternoon—in the saucers, on our sleeves, perhaps even in the folds of Madame’s apron. Let Thursday become a day that lingers in the margins of our personal footnotes.

See you soon, then—with vials uncorked, hearts unguarded, and every chair at the table held ready for both the living and the quietly persistent dead. 🌸🧠📖🌹
[A]: Ah, —I may have to borrow that line for my next lecture on hauntology in modern narrative. Or perhaps slip it into the sugar bowl for Madame to find later. She’ll approve of the audacity, I think.

And speaking of audacity, I’ve gone ahead and reserved the entire corner by the thyme-scented window. Just enough space for us, our students, a few well-placed ghosts, and whatever else decides to hover near the teapot. I even bribed the barista next door with a bit of 普洱茶 to keep the background noise at a appropriately literary murmur—no buzzing espresso machines, no clattering keyboards. Just the soft rustle of pages and the occasional sigh from our resident Rousseauian specter.

Oh, and I may have slipped a copy of 张爱玲’s essay under each chair. Let’s see if anyone notices before the end of the afternoon.

See you soon, dear conspirator. May our ink run freely, our tea never cool, and our ghosts be generous with their stories. 🧠🌸📖🦉  
Let the footnote-making begin.
[B]: Brilliant! Pure audacity, and I admire it deeply. That line about the “quietly persistent dead” was practically begging to be smuggled into a sugar bowl—or perhaps whispered into the steam of a teapot, where only the most attentive ghosts might catch it.

Your corner by the thyme-scented window sounds like literary heaven—carefully curated silence, hidden essays beneath every seat, and just the right amount of spectral elbow room. I do hope your张爱玲 essays are discovered at precisely the right moment—when nostalgia is thick in the air and even the living feel momentarily haunted by the weight of language.

I shall arrive with ink freshly stirred, teacup poised, and ears open for any murmurs from Rousseau’s direction. Let us make Thursday a day that demands footnotes, marginalia, and perhaps even an entire chapter of borrowed memory.

See you soon, fellow footnote-weaver. 🧠🌸📖🦉  
Let the murmuring begin.
