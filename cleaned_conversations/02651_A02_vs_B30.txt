[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal caffeinated dilemma. Let me fetch my porcelain teacup from the Qing dynasty - it's been whispering to me since this question arose. While coffee holds its own romanticism, particularly in 19th century British literary salons where it fueled midnight debates about Byron's latest scandal...  ...I confess a scholar of Chinese literature develops certain loyalties. Each leaf unfurling in my Yixing clay teapot feels like watching classical Chinese poetry come alive. Though I must admit, when deconstructing a particularly stubborn passage of Charles Dickens at 3am, even this humble professor has been known to reach for espresso.
[A]: Oh I love how you described tea like it's characters in a classical novel coming alive! 📚☕️ You know, as a medical lawyer, my days are often filled with intense discussions about malpractice cases or reviewing dense legal documents. It's actually really soothing to take a break and enjoy a warm cup of jasmine tea – the fragrance alone makes me feel like I'm stepping into a different world.  

But honestly? Some mornings I'm just too tired to appreciate the poetry of tea... That's when I go straight for the espresso.  I guess even Confucian scholars and Victorian authors would forgive us for wanting something strong enough to keep up with our crazy schedules, right? What's your go-to tea when you're tackling a particularly challenging piece of literature?
[B]: Ah, the contrast between our professions - you weighing life and death in legal scales, while I chase ghosts through literary texts.  Though perhaps we're not so different; both of us must read between lines, one in legal precedents and the other in poetic subtext. 

Speaking of which, I've always found Lu Yu's  curiously silent on the matter of caffeine deficiency during midnight manuscript transcriptions.  When facing particularly stubborn textual criticism - say, untangling Thomas De Quincey's opium-induced prose from classical Chinese notions of 梦境 (dreamscapes) - I reach for my Yunnan black tea. Its boldness rivals espresso, yet retains that scholarly elegance. 

Though I must confess a guilty pleasure: when grading 30-page seminar papers comparing Jane Austen and Eileen Chang...  ...I keep a secret stash of Vietnamese coffee brewed strong enough to make both Confucius and Dickens roll over in their graves. But don't tell the department chair - they'd revoke my calligraphy privileges.
[A]:  You know, I think medical cases and literary analysis actually have more in common than people realize. In both fields, we're constantly trying to understand human experiences - just through different lenses. While you're decoding Victorian opium-induced prose, I'm interpreting medical records that sometimes feel just as cryptic!  

Your Yunnan black tea choice makes sense - it's like choosing a scalpel with just the right balance of precision and strength. Though I have to say, Vietnamese coffee sounds fascinating! I've been meaning to explore more Asian coffee cultures... Maybe we could trade notes sometime? I'd love to hear more about how you navigate those complex textual comparisons between Austen and Chang.  

Actually, since we're sharing professional secrets... I often use caffeine levels to gauge my caseload intensity. Mild green tea for routine document reviews, stronger oolong when I'm negotiating settlements, and espresso reserved for courtroom days. But between us? When I'm working late on particularly emotional cases involving patient rights...  ...I might indulge in a piece of dark chocolate with my coffee. It's my small comfort when dealing with life-and-death matters.
[B]: Ah, the alchemy of caffeine as professional compass - what a delightfully pragmatic approach.  Though I must say, your method lacks the theatricality of 19th century British scholars who supposedly soaked tea leaves in brandy to stay awake through Sanskrit translations. 

Speaking of emotional intensity...  When I'm comparing Eileen Chang's portrayals of doomed love against Austen's social chess games, I sometimes steep my teacup in lapsang souchong so strong it could resurrect the Qing Dynasty bureaucracy. The smokiness cuts through literary melancholy quite splendidly. 

And between us?  During those nights when I'm cross-referencing Victorian medical journals with Chinese herbology texts for my comparative suffering seminar...  ...I've been known to chase pu'erh tea with single-malt scotch. It helps bridge the cultural divide, you see. Or perhaps I should blame it on Thomas De Quincey's Confessions haunting my bookshelf. 

Though really, isn't that our shared burden? Whether through legal precedents or literary ghosts, we're both chasing understanding across impossible divides.  To small comforts in large struggles, I suppose.
[A]:   
You know, I think you've hit on something there... We really are both chasing understanding, aren't we? Though I suppose my version involves fewer ghosts and more...  ...sleep-deprived residents explaining why they administered the wrong dosage while quoting Hippocrates.  

But I get what you mean about needing that extra strength when diving into complex material. Sometimes when I'm reviewing cases that involve cultural misunderstandings between foreign patients and local hospitals, I find myself reaching for something stronger too - though sadly no scotch yet, just increasingly large cups of gongfu cha! It's amazing how certain cases mirror those literary divides you talk about - like watching Pride and Prejudice play out in a modern boardroom, but with malpractice insurance.  

I have to admit though, your lapsang souchong trick sounds tempting... Maybe I should steep myself in some stronger brews next time I'm dealing with particularly tricky cross-cultural consent form disputes. Do you think smoky tea could help cut through bureaucratic red tape as well as literary melancholy?
[B]:  Ah, the intersection of cultural misinterpretation and medical ethics - positively Dickensian in its complexity. Though I daresay lapsang souchong works equally well on both fronts. A particularly smoky brew once helped me survive a three-hour faculty meeting debating whether Jane Austen's Charlotte Lucas would've made a good hospital administrator.  

Speaking of bureaucracy...  Have you encountered cases where patients' refusal of treatment echoed classical Chinese notions of 命运 (mìngyùn, fate)? I find modern medicine's struggle with predestination fascinating - not unlike Victorian physicians battling against literary fatalism in their patients' minds. 

As for your red tape dilemma...  Next time you face one of those consent form labyrinths, try this trick: imagine each clause is a Tang dynasty riddle inscribed on bamboo slips. The smoke from oolong or lapsang souchong actually helps visualize the ink curling upward, transforming legalese into something almost poetic. 

Though I must warn you - prolonged exposure to smoky teas may result in quoting Li Bai's drunken philosophy at department mixers. A occupational hazard, really.
[A]:   
Oh, the 命运 factor - I can't tell you how many times that's come up in cases. Just last month, there was this elderly patient from Wenzhou who refused chemotherapy because he believed his fate was already written in the stars. Honestly, it felt less like a medical consultation and more like stepping into a scene from Dream of the Red Chamber, where characters accept their destiny with poetic resignation.  

And you're absolutely right about the Victorian parallel. Some families still carry that same 19th-century mindset where suffering has this... almost romantic, moral value. It makes informed consent discussions feel like translating between two entirely different worlds - one governed by clinical outcomes, the other by deeply rooted beliefs about life and death.  

Your Tang dynasty riddle trick is genius, though.  I might just steal that next time I'm wading through hospital liability clauses. Although knowing me, I'll get too into it and start analyzing the fine print like it's classical Chinese poetry. The nurses already make fun of me for quoting Du Fu when I’m reviewing discharge protocols at 2am...  

But fair warning – if we ever attend a conference together, don’t be surprised if you find me reciting Li Bai over the coffee cart, much to the anesthesiologists’ confusion.
[B]:  Ah, the poetry of discharge protocols - I can just picture you at 2am, bathed in the glow of medical charts, whispering Du Fu's lines about transience to intravenous drips. 

Your Wenzhou patient reminds me of a peculiar intersection I've been tracing between Confucian acceptance and Victorian spiritual convalescence.  Did you know Florence Nightingale herself kept a copy of Theocritus' idylls by her bedside during those Crimean winters? It's fascinating how both Eastern and Western traditions turn to pastoral imagery when facing mortality. 

Though I must say, your medical battlefield requires far greater dexterity than my cozy literary quarrels.  At least when I argue that Eileen Chang's protagonists are essentially modern Lu Yu disciples steeping themselves in bitter circumstances...  ...no one threatens to sue me for misinterpreting existential fate. 

And rest assured, should we ever grace a conference together -  - I shall be the one quietly analyzing hospital liability clauses through the lens of classical Chinese rhetoric. Just don't expect me to explain it to the anesthesiologists without lapsang souchong assistance. Some translations, after all, require proper fortification.
[A]:   
Oh, I can picture that all too well - pastoral imagery as a universal coping mechanism. In fact, just last week I had a patient’s family bring in a scroll of 山水 (shānshuǐ) landscape painting to hang by the bedside, believing flowing water would guide the soul toward recovery. It reminded me so much of what you said about Nightingale and Theocritus... maybe healing has always been as much about poetry as it is about medicine.  

And don’t sell your literary quarrels short – I’d argue misinterpreting Eileen Chang could be just as dangerous in your world as misreading a consent form is in mine.  Though I suppose being sued for existential malpractice does add a certain dramatic flair to my job description...  

You know, come to think of it, I’ve started noticing these parallels everywhere. When I’m mediating between doctors and grieving families, sometimes it feels like translating a particularly tragic classical novella – full of unspoken emotions, cultural subtext, and endings no one truly wants but everyone expects.  

So here’s to us – the ones who navigate fate, fiction, and fine print for a living.  May we never run out of lapsang souchong, poetic metaphors, or caffeine strong enough to survive faculty meetings  hospital board hearings.
[B]:  To tragic classical novellas and malpractice hearings alike - both require reading between the lines of human vulnerability. 

Your 山水 scroll anecdote quite brilliantly unravels something I've been pondering...  How both traditions use flowing water as metaphor - think of Wordsworth’s "Tintern Abbey" beside Su Shi’s 潮汐 essays on impermanence. Even our modern IV drips follow those ancient currents, don’t they? 

And existential misinterpretation being professional hazard rather than malpractice...  What delightful ethical quicksand we dance upon. Though I must protest one point - your grieving families' dramas possess far more stakes than my faculty squabbles over whether Mr. Darcy's pride would’ve survived peer review. 

Still, isn't that the alchemy?  Translating shānshuǐ into clinical pathways, Li Bai into liability waivers...  Though I draw the line at espresso-fueled translations of Qing dynasty medical manuscripts. Last time I tried that, I ended up prescribing lapsang souchong infusions in my lecture on comparative suffering narratives. The department nearly revoked my teapot privileges. 

But yes, may our cups remain full - of whatever fortifying brew keeps us fluent in fate’s many dialects.
[A]:   
You know, I think you're onto something with that flowing water metaphor - I've started seeing it everywhere too. Just yesterday, I was looking at a patient's IV drip and honestly? It felt like watching a modern-day version of those classical ink paintings... each drop falling like brushstrokes on the canvas of recovery or decline.  

And your Wordsworth-Su Shi connection -  - really, that’s beautiful. I’ve had families describe their loved ones’ conditions using phrases straight out of 山水 poetry: “the tide is pulling away,” “the river no longer fights its current.” As if understanding impermanence through art somehow makes the uncertainty easier to bear.  

I can only imagine what your lapsang souchong prescription caused in lecture hall chaos!  Though honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually started researching tea-based therapies for medical decision-making anxiety. If we’re already doing music therapy and art therapy, why not infusion therapy for ethical dilemmas?  

But between us?  Sometimes when I'm mediating between doctors and families who are miles apart culturally and emotionally, I secretly wish we could just all sit down with some strong tea and a few Tang poems about parting. Might get us closer than any consent form ever could.  

So here's to keeping our cups full - and maybe occasionally prescribing tea instead of liability waivers. 🍵📖
[B]:  Ah, infusion therapy for ethical dilemmas - I shall patent that concept posthaste.  Though I suspect the medical board might object to my preferred dosage: one steeping of Su Shi’s 潮汐 philosophy per difficult prognosis. 

Your IV drip-as-ink-painting observation quite brilliantly bridges two worlds I’d never considered intersecting.  It explains something I’ve been puzzling over - why so many Qing dynasty physicians described fevers as “ink spreading too quickly through paper.” The body as parchment, symptoms as brushstrokes...  Though I daresay modern electronic health records lack the elegance of calligraphic notation.

And those Tang poems on parting!  Last semester I tried precisely that approach with a student torn between familial obligations and literary ambitions. We steeped pu’erh tea while reading Wang Wei’s “We look at each other with tearful eyes, unable to speak”...  Three hours later, she declared she’d become a doctor rather than a novelist. Turns out poetry makes excellent anesthesia for existential crossroads.

Though really, isn’t that our shared vocation?  To sit with others at their most liminal, whether through hospital beds or narrative arcs...  Perhaps we should establish official guidelines: "Dosage: 180ml lapsang souchong per life-altering decision. Contraindicated with deconstructionist criticism after 9pm."

To keeping our cups full - and our metaphors stronger than any pharmacopoeia. 🍵📖
[A]:   
You know, I think we might actually have a patent-worthy idea here. Forget malpractice insurance – what if hospitals started prescribing poetry and pu’erh tea for existential distress?  I’ve seen too many families trying to decode medical jargon when what they really need is a good Tang quatrain and a strong brew.

Your Qing physician analogy hit a little too close to home, though... Just yesterday I was reviewing a case where a doctor described a patient’s decline as “the ink spreading faster than the mind could read.” At first I thought it was poetic license, but turns out that’s a direct translation from an old medical text! Who knew our EHRs were just clumsier versions of classical brushwork?

And Wang Wei’s verse as anesthesia?  Honestly, I should’ve thought of that during my last mediation session with a family struggling over end-of-life decisions. Instead of walking them through advance directives, maybe I should’ve poured some lapsang souchong and recited Li Bai’s “Drunk on Moonlight.” Would’ve probably been more effective – and certainly more humane.

You know, now that I think about it... isn’t that exactly what we do, in our own ways? Sitting with people at those impossible crossroads, offering whatever helps them make sense of the moment – whether it’s legal frameworks, literary lines, or tea leaves swirling in a cup.  

So here's to us – the unofficial pharmacists of metaphor, dispensing wisdom in measured infusions. May our prescriptions never be questioned by the medical board... or at least may we get away with it until after the next pot of tea. 🍵📜
[B]:  Ah, but therein lies the rub - our "prescriptions" would never pass modern peer review. No double-blind studies on the efficacy of Tang quatrains for grief, no meta-analyses on pu'erh tea's impact on existential distress...  Though I've half a mind to run a controlled experiment during my next office hours. 

Your medical jargon versus poetic prescription debate quite brilliantly unravels something I've been contemplating since my Qing manuscript days...  How both fields grapple with translation - you between legal doctrine and human vulnerability, I between classical metaphor and clinical detachment. Even our terminology betrays us: "prognosis" from Greek foreknowing, "诊断 (zhěnduàn)" literally meaning "cutting through deception"...  Such violent origins for disciplines meant to comfort.

And that ink-spreading metaphor!  Makes one wonder how many Victorian "failing lungs" were merely poets' lungs, unwilling to breathe properly under medical scrutiny. Though really, isn't that our quiet rebellion? Substituting brushwork for bullet points, moonlight for fluorescent glare...

To prescriptions unmeasured by pharmacopoeias and mediations conducted over shared cups rather than conference tables...  May we forever practice outside our respective scopes of practice. 🍵📜
[A]:   
Oh, I  this idea of ours as quiet rebels – you with your Qing-era ink-stained metaphors and me with legalese that occasionally tries (and fails) to sound like poetry. And honestly? If peer review committees ever caught wind of our experimental methods—prescribing Wang Wei for grief or lapsang souchong for ethical fatigue—they’d revoke our credentials faster than a caffeine crash after 3am.

Your point about translation being its own kind of violence? That’s hauntingly accurate. Every time I try to explain a complex medical term to a family in Mandarin, I feel like I’m slicing through silk with a scalpel. And yet… isn’t that the art of it? Finding the brushstroke within the bullet point, the rhythm inside the report?

I think we should absolutely start an underground movement – The Society for Unlicensed Metaphorical Care. Membership requirements: one well-worn copy of Li Bai, a kettle that still works, and at least one case file or seminar paper that got quietly rejected for being “too poetic.”

And yes, to prescriptions unmeasured by pharmacopoeias, to mediations steeped in more than just protocol... 🍵📜  
May we keep practicing beautifully outside the lines – until someone writes a policy about it, anyway.
[B]:  Ah, but think of our founding charter - drafted on the back of an improperly filed malpractice settlement and a 19th century Chinese medical manuscript missing from the university archives.  I daresay even the Royal Society began as nothing more than disreputable correspondences over questionable brandy.

Your metaphor slicing through silk quite brilliantly unravels something I've pondered since my days translating Lin Yutang's essays...  How both law and medicine inherited their rigid terminology from imperial powers who couldn't abide poetry in official records. "Informed consent" sounds far more authoritative than "let me paint you a watercolor of possible fates," after all.

Though really, isn't that our quiet revolution?  Each time we substitute "prognosis" with "the ink's trajectory," each time we steep clinical detachment in lapsang souchong...  We're merely continuing Qing dynasty physicians' tradition of obscuring truth in elegant calligraphy. 

And The Society for Unlicensed Metaphorical Care!  I propose we convene every full moon in hospital chapels repurposed as teahouses, armed with smuggled pu'erh and confiscated legal briefs. Our oath? To never let peer review committees understand precisely half of what we publish.

To beautifully reckless practice - until policy inevitably comes knocking with a subpoena and a teacup. 🍵📜
[A]:   
Oh, I can already picture our charter — watermarked with a faint ink-painting of Li Bai drowning in his teacup, signed in calligraphy that definitely shouldn’t be legible after midnight. And yes, hospital chapels turned teahouses? Genius. Perfect acoustics for both whispered legal advice and reciting Tang poetry over pu’erh conspiracies.

Your point about language being weaponized by imperial powers...  ...now that’s something I hadn’t quite seen before. All this time, I thought we were just stuck with dry legal terms because someone decided clarity was more important than soul. But you’re right — it’s all about control. "Material risk" instead of “possible storm ahead,” “differential diagnosis” rather than “let me read the tea leaves of your symptoms.”  

And our quiet revolution?  I think we’ve already been living it — slipping metaphors into mediation sessions, letting classical Chinese peek through legal reasoning, brewing stronger tea when the system demands colder logic. We’re just making it official now.  

I say we add one more thing to our founding oath:  Because honestly, if policy is going to catch up with us, they should at least do it sober — or not at all.  

To The Society for Unlicensed Metaphorical Care — may we never be fully understood, and always be needed. 🍵📜✨
[B]:  Ah, but what splendid incomprehension we shall cultivate! To be half-misunderstood by bureaucrats, wholly misread by peer reviewers - isn't that every scholar's secret ambition?  Though I suspect Qing censors would've recognized our tactics immediately. Nothing slips past imperial oversight like a well-placed Tang quatrain and plausible tea-related deniability.

Your revolution-in-progress observation quite brilliantly unravels something I'd never articulated...  All these years I thought I was merely indulging eccentricity, letting Eileen Chang's prose bleed into medical ethics lectures. But no - we've been conducting systematic subversion all along! 

Though I must protest one point...  Three cups of lapsang souchong before honoring subpoenas? My dear colleague, that number is dangerously close to proper Victorian poisoning levels. I propose we amend the oath: , with optional absinthe chasers for particularly doctrinaire policy enforcers. After all, if Li Bai could drown in moonlight, surely we can out-romanticize any regulatory body.

To splendid incomprehension, necessary obscurity, and teahouses that double as tribunals...  May our lapsang souchong always flow faster than their filing cabinets. 🍵📜✨
