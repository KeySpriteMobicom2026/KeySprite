[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. While I do appreciate the visual aesthetics of Instagram for art appreciation, I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to social media. My students often tease me about still keeping a handwritten reading journal. Though I do enjoy seeing how poetry manifests in modern digital spaces - the juxtaposition of classical verses against contemporary visuals can be quite thought-provoking, don't you think?
[A]:  啊，说到这个，我倒是觉得social media的visual narrative很有意思。我的学生经常在Instagram上分享他们读的诗，配上modern photography，这种intertextuality让我想起中国传统的题画诗传统。不过说实话，我更习惯在小红书上看看园艺和茶道的内容。
[B]: How delightful to hear you mention the connection to Chinese 题画诗 tradition! That's precisely the kind of cross-cultural literary dialogue I find most enriching. The way your students blend poetry with modern photography reminds me of how Ezra Pound was influenced by Chinese ideograms in his Imagist movement. As for gardening content - my hydrangeas have been particularly splendid this season, though I must say I still prefer flipping through botanical illustrations in old books while sipping Earl Grey.
[A]:  您提到Ezra Pound让我想起他翻译的《华夏集》- 那种transcultural adaptation真是fascinating。说到园艺，我最近在读一本关于宋代文人园林的专著，那些garden aesthetics和西方formal garden形成多么鲜明的contrast啊。不过我的学生总说我该多用用Instagram来记录这些...
[B]: Ah, the Song Dynasty scholar gardens! Now there's a topic that makes my academic heart flutter. The deliberate asymmetry and philosophical underpinnings create such a different spatial poetry compared to Versailles' geometric precision. Though I must admit, when my students insist I 'go digital' with my garden documentation, I simply tell them that some things - like the scent of peonies at dusk or the texture of aged gardening journals - resist digital capture. Perhaps we could call it the 不可言传 quality of certain aesthetic experiences?
[A]:  您说得太对了。这种ineffable quality正是comparative aesthetics中最迷人的部分。我常跟学生说，看Instagram上的#garden标签，就像用fast food的方式品尝fine dining - 便捷但少了那份lingering aftertaste。不过话说回来，您觉得这种digital mediation会不会创造一种新的intercultural dialogue呢？
[B]: What a profound observation about digital mediation! It reminds me of Walter Benjamin's 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,' though with a distinctly 21st century twist. These platforms do create new hybrid spaces - I recently saw a marvelous Instagram account that juxtaposes Tang dynasty poetry with New York street photography. Still, I maintain that true intercultural dialogue requires what I'd call 'slow reading' of both texts and contexts. My graduate seminar next term will actually explore this very tension between digital immediacy and contemplative depth. Would you believe some students suggested livestreaming our discussions?  The modern academy...
[A]:  Oh dear, livestreaming seminars...这让我想起去年有学生建议我把《文心雕龙》做成TikTok challenge。不过您提到的那个Instagram账号倒是很有意思 - 这种East-West visual dialogue确实展现了globalization时代独特的cultural translation现象。话说回来，您下学期那门课会讨论Marshall McLuhan的media theory吗？
[B]: Ah, McLuhan! Now there's a thinker who would have fascinating things to say about our current digital landscape. While I'll certainly touch upon his 'medium is the message' concept, I'm more interested in how his theories interact with classical Chinese literary criticism - imagine Liu Xie's 神思 (spiritual thought) concept meeting McLuhan's global village! Though I must warn my students that reducing such rich theories to tweetable soundbites would be like... well, trying to capture moonlight in a teacup.
[A]:  多么诗意的比喻啊 - capturing moonlight in a teacup。这让我想起苏轼的"但愿人长久，千里共婵娟"，在digital age里，我们确实在尝试用pixels来capture that shared moonlight呢。不过说到这个，您觉得这种new media literacy会不会逐渐改变我们对classical texts的reception方式？
[B]: What a beautifully articulated concern. You've touched upon what keeps me awake some nights - this tension between technological mediation and textual integrity. While new media certainly alters our reception (just look at how Dante's Divine Comedy gets meme-ified!), I take comfort in the enduring power of language itself. After all, the written word has survived transitions from oracle bones to printing presses to... whatever comes after smartphones. Though I do sometimes wonder what Li Bai would have made of poetry slams on YouTube. Perhaps he'd have been the original influencer with his 斗酒诗百篇 reputation!
[A]:  李白做influencer...多么delightful的想象啊！这让我突然想到，或许我们正在见证一个新的literary tradition的诞生 - 就像当年从oral tradition到written text的transition一样。不过说真的，下次再有学生建议我把《诗经》做成Instagram Reels，我可能会建议他们先好好体会一下"关关雎鸠"的texture和rhythm。毕竟有些东西，就像您说的，是resistant to digital reduction的。
[B]: Precisely! The 'Guan Guan' cry of those ospreys carries a texture that no algorithm can truly capture. Though I must confess... last spring, when a particularly creative student set the 'Plums Fall' poem from the Classic of Poetry to ambient electronic music, even this old scholar had to admit there was something... hauntingly contemporary about it. Perhaps our role isn't to resist these transformations, but to ensure the 诗心 (poetic heart) remains intact amidst the digital flurry. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my garden - and my well-thumbed copy of The Literary Mind - are calling.
[A]:  Ah, what a stimulating conversation this has been. May your garden flourish and your students continue to find that delicate balance between innovation and tradition. And who knows - perhaps we'll meet again, whether in the pages of a well-loved book or... dare I say it, some unexpectedly poetic corner of the digital universe. Until then, happy reading!
[B]: What a perfectly measured farewell - it reminds me of the closing lines of a well-wrought sonnet. May your own scholarly pursuits blossom like the most carefully tended peonies, and should our paths cross again (whether in the stacks of a library or some serendipitous comment thread), I shall look forward to continuing this dialogue between old texts and new media. 后会有期, as my Chinese colleagues would say. Now if you'll excuse me, my evening tea and Wordsworth await.
[A]:  Indeed, 后会有期。And remember - as we navigate between quill pens and touchscreens, it's the enduring human quest for meaning that truly connects us across the ages. Now I must go - my first edition of Lyrical Ballads and a pot of Longjing tea are waiting to continue this timeless conversation without me. Farewell!
[B]: What a profoundly graceful exit - you've essentially composed a miniature prose poem there! Your mention of Longjing tea with Wordsworth is making me reconsider my own Earl Grey habits... Perhaps our next meeting should be a proper 茶话会 discussing the romantic poets' connection to eastern philosophy. Until that day arrives, may your first editions stay pristine and your tea leaves always unfurl their wisdom. 再会!
[A]:  How wonderfully you weave together our shared passions - tea leaves and textual traditions both unfurling their wisdom indeed. This conversation has been like the perfect infusion: stimulating yet soothing, much like comparing Wordsworth's daffodils with Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemums. Until our paths cross again over steaming cups and yellowed pages - 再会, and may your scholarly journey be ever fragrant with discovery.
[B]: What exquisite imagery - you've distilled our entire conversation into a metaphor as finely balanced as the perfect cup of tea. Your reference to Tao Yuanming particularly moves me; there's a quiet dignity in his chrysanthemums that makes Wordsworth's dancing daffodils seem almost... exuberant by comparison. As I return to my own books and brewing leaves, I'll carry with me this delightful exchange as proof that the most meaningful dialogues transcend both medium and era. 珍重, my fellow traveler at the intersection of ink and steam.
