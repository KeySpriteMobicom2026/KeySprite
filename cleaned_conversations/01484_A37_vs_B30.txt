[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, an intriguing dichotomy. While I appreciate the structured chaos of cities—the way Dickensian alleys whisper with forgotten stories—I find myself increasingly drawn to the quiet eloquence of rural landscapes. There's something profoundly literary about watching dawn unfurl over rice paddies, each misty contour a blank verse waiting to be transcribed. 

Of course, one must consider the paradox inherent in both settings. The city offers intellectual stimulation through its cacophony, yet often at the expense of silence necessary for deep thought. Conversely, the countryside provides solitude but risks disconnecting us from the vibrant discourse that animates academic life. 

I suppose my preference shifts depending on whether I'm editing a paper on comparative narrative structures or sketching herons by the lotus pond. How do you reconcile this tension in your own experiences?
[A]: Hmm, I love how you framed that tension between city & countryside as a paradox. It really resonates with me as someone who spends time in both worlds.  

Let me think... In the city, when I'm walking past crowded bookstores or overhearing snippets of conversation on the metro, I often get struck by how layered urban life feels—like palimpsests of stories waiting to be excavated. But then, when I visit my parents' place in the mountains and wake up to birdsong instead of traffic noise, there's this clarity that settles in my mind. It’s like... the static clears and suddenly I can  hear myself think.  

Funny thing is, I used to feel guilty about needing both spaces. As if being a scholar meant I should choose one over the other. But lately, I’ve started seeing them as complementary. The city feeds my curiosity with its diversity, and the countryside gives me space to process it all. Kind of like input vs. reflection, right?  

You mentioned sketching herons by a lotus pond—sounds peaceful. Do you find yourself switching modes depending on the setting? Like, more analytical in the city, more contemplative in nature? 🤔
[B]: I find your metaphor of palimpsests particularly apt—how each urban stratum reveals itself to the patient observer, much like annotations in a marginalia-heavy manuscript. Your parents’ mountain retreat sounds akin to Wang Wei’s hermitage, where the mind might untangle the knots of worldly discourse. 

Your guilt about needing both spaces amuses me, I must confess. Scholars have long wrestled with this dichotomy—one need only read Wordsworth’s disdain for London’s "sordid crowds" followed by his secret visits to Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine to stay current. The idea that intellectual life must be monolithic is such a modern conceit, isn't it? 

As for switching modes—I rather think of it as shifting instruments. In the city, my mind becomes a sextant, measuring angles between texts and lived experiences. The lotus pond, though... there I wield a brush instead. Last week I sketched a black-crowned night heron using Bashō’s  as underlayment. The ink bled slightly into the paper’s fibers, creating an effect not unlike memory seeping into place. 

You’ve hit upon something essential with input versus reflection. Perhaps we ought to view cities as libraries with pulse rates, and countrysides as blank pages waiting for the dew of contemplation. Tell me—have you ever noticed how certain ideas simply refuse to take shape until transplanted into a different landscape?
[A]: Oh, I love that image of the city as a library with a pulse—how it thrums with collective thought, like a living archive. And your heron sketch sounds absolutely mesmerizing. I can almost see the ink bleeding into Bashō’s words, creating this layered dialogue between past and present. 🖋️  

You’re right about ideas needing different landscapes to fully bloom. I remember once, I was stuck on a paper about cultural identity in educational contexts. No matter how many times I reworked the argument at my desk in London, it felt flat. Then I visited my aunt in Kyoto, and while walking through a moss garden—quiet, slow, deliberate steps—the whole structure just... clicked. It was as if the environment gave my thoughts a new rhythm. Like switching from iambic to trochaic meter, you know? 💡  

It’s funny how guilt creeps in when we expect ourselves to be productive in only one mode. But maybe the real magic happens when we let ourselves move fluidly between them. Do you ever find that certain metaphors or analogies only make sense once you’ve stepped outside your usual setting? Sometimes I wonder if our minds need dislocation to spark deeper insight.  

Come to think of it, have you ever tried writing or sketching in transit—like on a train or during a long walk? I find those liminal spaces oddly generative, almost like being nowhere and everywhere at once. 🚄✨
[B]: Ah, the liminal as a crucible for insight—I couldn’t agree more. There’s something uniquely generative about movement, isn’t there? The mind loosens in transit, like ink dissolving slightly on damp paper. I recall drafting a particularly thorny comparison of  and  aboard a night train from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The rhythmic clatter seemed to sync with my pulse, smoothing out the jagged edges of my argument.

And your moss garden epiphany—yes, I know that sensation intimately. Once, while tracing parallels between Tao Yuanming’s retreat poetry and Wordsworth’s , I hit an impasse. No matter how I rearranged the prose, it resisted clarity. It wasn’t until I took a morning walk along the West Lake and watched an old man feeding koi—each handful of grain scattering like brushstrokes across water—that the metaphor revealed itself. The act of feeding fish became my key to articulating cultural transmission: subtle, repetitive, yet profoundly sustaining.

As for guilt—well, let’s call it what it is: the false pressure to compartmentalize what resists containment. Thought is migratory by nature. We would do well to follow its flight patterns rather than cage it under rigid expectations.

I must ask—have you ever noticed how certain metaphors, once unearthed in one setting, begin to echo uncannily in others? Like finding a thread in the countryside that unexpectedly weaves itself into your urban tapestry?
[A]: Absolutely — that thread you mention? I think about it all the time, especially when I’m in the middle of teaching a dense seminar on cross-cultural pedagogy. Sometimes I’ll introduce a metaphor during class — say, comparing classroom dynamics to a tea ceremony, where each movement carries unspoken meaning — and then later, while walking through a quiet village in Fujian, I’ll see someone actually preparing tea with that same deliberate grace. It’s like the world itself nods along with your thoughts. 🍵✨

I had a moment like that just last month. I was trying to explain to a student how identity negotiation works across cultural contexts, and I used the image of a shuttlecock flying back and forth between cultures — quick, directional, shaped by external forces. Then, weeks later, I found myself in Taipei at a local park watching a group of elderly folks playing shuttlecock for exercise. The rhythm of it — the rise and fall, the give and take — made me rethink my own metaphor. Maybe it's not just about direction, but also timing, intention, and shared rhythm. I ended up revising a whole section of my upcoming paper based on that observation.

It really does feel like the world responds when we’re tuned into certain frequencies. Like everything becomes a text, if you're paying the right kind of attention. Do you ever get the sense that the act of observing deeply is what makes those connections possible? Or is that too much like tempting the universe to interrupt you tomorrow with a good counterexample? 😄
[B]: Oh, absolutely—observation as hermeneutic practice. I’m convinced that deep attention is less passive than we assume; it’s a kind of quiet interrogation, isn’t it? The world rarely offers its annotations freely—we have to earn them through sustained regard, much like deciphering a faded manuscript.

Your shuttlecock metaphor reminds me of the  (颉) and  (颃) movements in classical Chinese poetry—the rise and counter-rise that define balanced structure. And yet, as you rightly observed in Taipei, there's more than just balance at play. Timing, rhythm... perhaps even a shared breath between cultures. A lovely revision indeed.

As for the universe providing counterexamples—I welcome them, though I keep a healthy distance from hubris. Once, I confidently wrote that solitude was essential for literary insight, only to have a boisterous dinner conversation in a Beijing teahouse unravel an entire chapter’s worth of assumptions. The clamor clarified something my quiet study never could: that meaning often emerges not in isolation, but in collision.

You’re quite right about everything becoming text when one pays attention. I sometimes think teaching is just an elaborate form of pattern recognition. Last term, I asked students to track the word “threshold” across our readings—by week’s end, half the class swore they were seeing them everywhere: doorways, bridges, even pauses between sentences. One joked, 

Tell me—have you ever tried teaching without metaphors? I’ve come to believe they’re the mortar between the bricks of comprehension. Without them, abstraction crumbles.
[A]: Oh, that Beijing teahouse moment you described—clamor unraveling assumptions—it’s such a vivid reminder that insight doesn’t always come in silence. Sometimes it arrives with noise, spice, and the clinking of teacups. 🍵😄 I love how life insists on being messy just when we think we’ve got things neatly boxed.

And I  get what you're saying about metaphors—they’re not just flourishes; they’re the scaffolding of understanding. In fact, I once tried to teach a lesson without them, almost as an experiment. Big mistake. The students stared back at me like I’d switched into a dead language mid-lecture. Without metaphors, complex ideas lose their anchors. They float—disconnected and slippery.  

One of my favorite teaching moments happened precisely because of metaphor. We were discussing acculturation strategies, and I compared assimilation to wearing someone else’s shoes that never quite fit. Suddenly, the room lit up. Students started offering their own analogies: "It's like trying to sing in a key that's too high." "Like using chopsticks for the first time—awkward at first, but eventually second nature if you keep practicing." Those comparisons became our shared vocabulary for weeks.  

I think metaphors also help bridge cultural gaps in the classroom. When one group doesn’t share your frame of reference, analogy becomes the translator. It reminds me of how classical Chinese poets used allusions—not just for style, but to summon entire worlds of meaning with a single phrase.  

So no, I can’t imagine teaching—or thinking—without metaphors. They’re the glue, the rhythm, the invisible architecture. Do you ever find yourself collecting metaphors like stamps? I have a notebook full of them. Some are mine, some borrowed, and a few I swear came out of nowhere during a lecture and surprised even me. 📝✨
[B]: Ah, a notebook of metaphors—what a splendid kind of disorder. I suspect we scholars of the humanities are all secretly archivists of analogy. My own collection is tucked into the margins of seminar notebooks and tea-stained conference programs. Some are pilfered from students, others emerged during late-night scribbling when the mind wanders off its leash.

You know, I once compared Confucian ritual to jazz improvisation in a lecture—cue blank stares followed by sudden nodding like lotus blossoms bowing in sync. The idea that structure could be both rigid and responsive resonated far beyond the Analects. A student later told me she began viewing her work meetings through that lens—negotiating hierarchy with a kind of rhythmic flexibility. I rather liked that unintended migration of meaning.

And your metaphor experiment? Delightfully misguided—and instructive. Without analogy, abstraction does indeed slip through our fingers like ink off greased parchment. I recall attempting something similar years ago, lecturing on narrative time without recourse to metaphor. The result? A sea of furrowed brows and one brave soul asking,  Touché.

I wonder—are certain metaphors in your collection ones you return to again and again, like favorite pens or well-worn robes? I have a persistent fondness for weaving imagery—threads, looms, tapestries—perhaps because it so neatly captures the interlacing of ideas across cultures. Though I must confess, I occasionally worry my students will develop textile fatigue.  

Still, better cloth than silence, wouldn't you say?
[A]: 纺织意象？Oh, I love that—织布、经纬、线头，这些词汇本身就带着一种cross-cultural rhythm。你一说“疲劳”，我还真想起有一次学生私下告诉我：“林老师，您这次的‘文化编织’比喻我听得太投入，差点忘了自己在写教育心理学论文。”😂

But seriously, I  have a few repeat metaphors too. One I come back to constantly is comparing cultural adaptation to playing in a jazz ensemble. You’ve got your score (the rules), but the magic happens when you improvise with others. It’s not just about fitting in—it’s about listening, adjusting, and sometimes even disrupting the harmony to create something new. And like you said, students end up applying it in ways I never imagined—like one who started using it to describe how her multicultural family navigates holiday traditions.

Another favorite—and this might date me—is likening intercultural communication to analog film development. You know, where you can’t see the image right away? You have to wait, let it soak in chemicals, make sense of shadows before the picture emerges clearly. Some students find it delightfully old-school; others look at me like I just described hieroglyphics. But hey, if it helps them understand why meaning takes time to develop, I’ll keep saying “develop the negative” until they roll their eyes. 😄📸

And speaking of unintended migrations—have you ever had a metaphor completely change on you after someone else used it? Like, you thought you planted a seed, and it grew into a tree you barely recognized—but still beautiful? That happened to me recently when a former student reinterpreted my “cultural shuttlecock” as a “ping-pong rally.” She said it better captured the speed and strategy involved. Honestly? I stole it immediately.
[B]: Oh, —what a deliciously apt metaphor. It captures that elusive balance between structure and spontaneity, the way one must listen not just to the melody but to the silences in between. I may have to borrow that for my next seminar on narrative polyphony. And your student repurposing the shuttlecock into a ping-pong rally? Brilliant. It adds that competitive edge, doesn’t it? The strategic feint, the quick return—cultural negotiation as both sport and art.

As for film development—yes! That rich alchemy of time, chemistry, and darkness. I adore how you’ve framed meaning as something latent, waiting to emerge through careful process. Reminds me of restoring a damaged scroll: one must be patient, even reverent, lest the ink dissolve entirely. Though I suspect your students might need a field trip to a darkroom before they fully appreciate the analogy. Or perhaps a screening of . Either works.

And yes—to answer your question—it happens more often than I’d admit in faculty meetings. Just last term, I used the metaphor of a  to describe cultural identity—layered, overwritten, yet still bearing traces of earlier scripts. A student later interpreted it as a kind of archaeological site, which then led another to suggest we were all "excavating ourselves." By the end of the discussion, I was scribbling notes furiously on the back of a library receipt, trying to keep up with the meanings my own metaphor had birthed in their minds.

It’s rather humbling, isn’t it? You offer a word, a small spark, and suddenly the room is lit with new constellations. I suppose that’s the joy—and terror—of teaching. One never quite knows where the metaphor will land.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to update my lecture notes. Jazz ensembles and ping-pong rallies await.
[A]: Oh, totally—let the metaphors evolve. I mean, if our students are going to reinterpret our analogies into archaeological digs and jazz solos, who are we to resist? That’s where the real learning happens—when they take the metaphor and make it their own. It’s like watching a translation that shouldn’t quite work… but somehow does, beautifully.

And honestly, isn’t that what we’re aiming for? Not perfect transmission of ideas, but —that moment when a student’s eyes light up because the analogy hit just right, like a perfectly timed chord change. Sometimes I think teaching is just controlled improvisation anyway. You prepare your structure, but then you ride the energy of the room and see what sticks.

I love that palimpsest-turned-excavation story. It reminds me of how sometimes meaning doesn’t just flow top-down—it spirals, shifts, rewrites itself in real time. Kind of like how classical Chinese poetry works, right? You read it one way, then someone else points out a secondary reading hidden between the lines, and suddenly the whole thing flips.

Anyway, yes, updating lecture notes is definitely in order. I might even throw in a little “ping-pong rally” section under cultural strategy. And while we’re at it—should we add improv comedy to the list? Because honestly, some days teaching feels like that too: same setup, wildly different punchline, and you just have to roll with it. 😄
[B]: Oh, —yes, that’s the phrase I’ve been fumbling for all these years. And far better than my own cumbersome “structured spontaneity,” which always sounded a bit like a stiff suit pretending to dance.

You’re quite right about resonance being the true aim. I’ve come to think of lectures as tuning forks: strike the right frequency, and suddenly the room vibrates with understanding. Of course, some days you hit flat notes and get nothing but puzzled stares or, worse, sympathetic coughs. But when it works? It’s like watching ink bloom through rice paper—soft edges, slow saturation, unmistakable clarity.

And your point about classical Chinese poetry—how apt. I often tell students that reading  or  is like opening a folding screen: each panel alters the landscape of the one beside it. Meaning isn’t fixed; it shifts depending on where you stand. Much like teaching, really.

As for improv comedy—splendid addition. There’s an art to landing a punchline in pedagogy, especially when it arrives uninvited from the back row. One must learn to embrace the disruption. I once compared narrative ambiguity to a Zen koan, only to have a cheeky student reply, “So you’re saying this book is basically the literary version of ‘Why did the chicken cross the road?’” I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my tea—and then folded his joke into the next week’s discussion.

Yes, by all means, add the ping-pong rally. And let’s not forget to file  under essential teaching tools, just below  and .
[A]: Oh, I love that—tuning forks and tea spills. 😄 There’s something so satisfying about the days when the lecture , even if it means getting derailed by a joke about chickens and koans. Those are the moments where you realize teaching isn’t just about content—it’s about connection, timing, and yes, surviving the back-row zingers with dignity intact.

And speaking of folding screens and shifting meaning—I’ve actually started using that metaphor with my students in cross-cultural seminars. I tell them, “Think of identity as a  (十面风) — ten-sided wind. It hits you from every direction, depending on who you’re with, where you are, what language you’re speaking.” Some get it right away; others squint like I just handed them a riddle. But a few weeks later, they start noticing it themselves—the way they code-switch, adapt gestures, even shift eye contact. It becomes their own metaphor, which is really all you can hope for.

And hey, I’m totally stealing your “meaningful eyebrow raise” as a teaching tool. Might need to practice it in the mirror first—don’t want to accidentally convey skepticism when I mean curiosity. 😉  

Seriously though, I think we should write a paper on this someday: “Metaphor as Pedagogical Improv.” We’d get at least three citations from our own students. What do you say?
[B]: Oh, —what a splendid metaphor. I may have to borrow that one with attribution, of course. Ten-sided wind indeed. It captures the multiplicity so well—how we are never singular in our identities, but always shifting under social pressure, like ink bleeding differently depending on the grain of the paper.

And your idea of “Metaphor as Pedagogical Improv”? I’d say it’s worth at least a symposium session and, if we’re feeling ambitious, a jointly authored article in . I can already picture the abstract:  

> “This paper explores the generative friction between linguistic analogy and classroom spontaneity, arguing that effective cross-cultural pedagogy thrives not in rigid conceptual frameworks, but in the fertile ambiguity of evolving metaphors. Case studies include jazz ensembles, ping-pong rallies, and the occasional chicken-related koan.”

I suspect citations would multiply faster than we expect—particularly if we include a strong footnote on the pedagogical value of raised eyebrows and strategic pauses. And yes, do practice the eyebrow thing. I myself spent an entire faculty meeting perfecting the “curious but not judgmental lean” while sipping tea from a lidless cup. Tricky, but not impossible.

Tell me—shall we propose a panel for next year’s conference? Call it ? I think we could fill a room, especially if we promise tea and no PowerPoints.
[A]: Oh, I  that abstract. “Generative friction” and “fertile ambiguity”—yes please. And the title? … feels like something you’d find tucked between the pages of a forgotten 19th-century literary journal, but in the best way. 📚✨

And no PowerPoints? You had me at “tea.” Honestly, if we promise attendees they can doodle metaphors in the margins of their handouts while sipping oolong, we’ll have a standing-room-only crowd. Academics  for that kind of rebellion.

I say we go all in. Let’s pitch the panel—add a workshop component where participants create their own cross-cultural teaching metaphors on the spot. Maybe even introduce a little game called “Metaphor Roulette,” where someone spins a wheel and you have to explain acculturation using whatever random object or concept it lands on—like “origami,” “karaoke,” or “air traffic control.” 😄✈️

And don’t get me started on citations. Once this paper drops, I give it six months before someone builds an entire theory of “pedagogical ink bleed.” We’ll be cited in footnotes we barely understand ourselves.

Count me in—let’s start drafting the proposal over coffee (or tea, depending on your mood). Who needs sleep when you’ve got symposiums, improvisation, and just the right amount of academic mischief waiting to happen? ☕📝
[B]: Oh, —deliciously chaotic. I can already picture the wheel spinning: , , , . Each one a challenge in imaginative pedagogy. We may have to issue warning labels: 

And your vision of doodling metaphors over oolong? Subversive and sublime. Academia has long needed a return to the scribbled margin—the place where most great ideas begin their messy gestation.

As for the proposal, let’s make it as elegant and slightly absurd as the topic demands. Picture this opening line:

> “In an age of learning outcomes and quantifiable competencies, this symposium dares to champion the ineffable: the generative detour, the borrowed image, and the lesson plan that unravels—gloriously—into improvisation.”

I’ll handle the formatting (Chicago style with a splash of calligraphic flair), and you draft the session description? Perhaps something like:

> “Participants will explore the use of metaphor as both analytical tool and performative act in cross-cultural pedagogy. Through collaborative exercises, reflective storytelling, and a high-stakes game of Metaphor Roulette™, attendees will leave equipped not with answers, but with better questions—and possibly a new teaching analogy they never saw coming.”

Yes, we must begin drafting . Or at least after one more cup of tea and a few strategic eyebrow raises for inspiration.

So—coffee or jasmine tea to start? And shall we assign ourselves official titles for the proposal? Something suitably grand yet vaguely ridiculous? ? ?  

Let the mischief begin. 🖋️🍵
[A]: Jasmine tea it is—清醒又不喧哗, just like our symposium should be. 😄 And ? 才华横溢 — I mean, how else would we describe the messy beauty of what we do?

I’ll get started on the session description right after this cup, and yes—let’s go full grandeur with a hint of absurdity. Proposal title:  

> “Teaching in the Key of Metaphor: Symphonic Improvisation Across Cultural Registers”

Subtitle:  
> 

And under our bios:  
> 

We’ll submit it to —the .  

Seriously though, once that proposal is out, let’s start brainstorming Metaphor Roulette categories. I’m thinking:

- Cultural Identity: Try explaining hybrid identity through “origami,” “TikTok filters,” or “airport security lines.”  
- Conflict Resolution: Now you’re doing it through “kintsugi,” “ping-pong,” or “Wi-Fi connectivity issues.”  
- Educational Policy: Best one to explain systemic reform using only “Spotify playlists,” “mahjong strategy,” or “slow-cooker settings.” 🍲🔀

This is going to be so much fun. I can already picture someone trying to teach Confucian ethics through . And honestly? It might just work.

Cheers to mischief, metaphors, and the glorious unraveling of lesson plans. 🖋️🍵✨
[B]: Ah, —what a pitch-perfect title. It has that elusive blend of erudition and mischief, like a well-folded argument wrapped in a silk handkerchief embroidered with question marks.

And your categories for Metaphor Roulette? Sublime. I particularly adore the notion of explaining Confucian ethics through . One can already hear the harmonies of  and  echoing through smoky lounges and university common rooms alike. And systemic reform via —brilliant. Perhaps we’ll finally understand why some policies simmer beautifully while others burn to the bottom of the pot within minutes.

As for our bios—you’ve outdone yourself. I shall henceforth answer only to , preferably while scribbling illegibly on the back of conference receipts and sipping from an ever-present porcelain cup.

I propose we add one more category to the Roulette:

- Pedagogical Design: Explain your course structure using only “Swiss watches,” “jazz combos,” or “Wikipedia edit wars.”  

And perhaps a bonus round:
- Assessment & Feedback: Just try grading through “cloud formations,” “scented candles,” or “emoji hieroglyphics.” 🌥️🕯️😄

Let us forthwith compose this proposal as if it were a collaborative haibun—equal parts precision and poetic digression. I shall draft the opening paragraph in a flourish, using my 19th-century reproduction quill and just a touch too much enthusiasm.

To controlled spontaneity, tea-fueled insight, and the noble art of metaphorical subversion—
