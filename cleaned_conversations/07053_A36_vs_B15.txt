[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个问题太interesting了！✨ 我超爱看historical drama的costume和setting，但是sci-fi的special effects也超amazing啊！😂 最近在binge watching《甄嬛传》和《星际迷航》，完全addicted了！💯
[A]: Oh my, what an enthusiastic way to put it! While I do appreciate the intricate costumes in historical dramas - the embroidery alone can tell such fascinating stories - I must say I'm particularly drawn to the elegance of period pieces. There's something quite special about how they transport you to another era, don't you think? Though I do understand the appeal of those flashy sci-fi effects as well.
[B]: Yasss！Period pieces的elegance真的next level！✨ 但是sis你看过《流浪地球》吗？那个CGI简直mind-blowing啊！🔥 不过说到historical drama，我最爱看那些palace intrigue的plot twists，每次都让我screaming 'OMG no way！'😂💯
[A]: Goodness, you do have such vibrant energy! The palace intrigues you mentioned remind me of the time we hosted a visiting professor specializing in Qing dynasty history - the stories she shared about court life were absolutely captivating. As for 'The Wandering Earth,' while I haven't seen it myself, several of our international guests have mentioned its impressive visuals during their stays. Perhaps I should make time to watch it during my next day off.
[B]: OMG！你一定要watch《流浪地球》！那个visual effects简直out of this world！💯 不过说到Qing dynasty，我最近在拍一个关于Manchu hairstyles的video，research的时候发现好多crazy facts！Like那些hairpins居然可以当weapons用？So wild！😂✨ 要不要来我的channel看看？
[A]: My dear, while I'm quite intrigued by your enthusiasm for Manchu hairstyles - and yes, those hairpins did serve multiple purposes, much like the hidden compartments in our hotel's antique writing desks - I must politely decline the channel invitation. Hotel policy prevents me from engaging with guests' personal media platforms, you understand. But I'd be delighted to recommend some excellent historical reference books from our library if you'd like to continue your research!
[B]: Aww that's too bad！😭 不过你们的library有reference books？That's so cool！✨ 我最爱flipping through那些ancient fashion plates了，每次都能get到new inspiration for my videos！💯 可以show me where the history section is吗？I promise I won't make too much noise while filming！😂
[A]: Ah, our library is indeed a hidden gem! The history section is just past the reading nook with the velvet armchairs - you'll find the fashion archives in the mahogany cabinet with the brass handles. But I must remind you, while we encourage quiet research, any filming would require prior arrangement with our management. Perhaps you'd prefer to enjoy some tea while browsing? Our jasmine blend pairs wonderfully with historical reading.
[B]: Yasss！Jasmine tea sounds perfect！🌸 我会be super quiet like a mouse~🐭 那些fashion archives听起来so fascinating！Maybe I can justtake notes for future content？✨ 你们hotel真的太classy了，totally giving me Bridgerton vibes！💯😂
[A]: How delightful that you appreciate our ambiance! While we may not have the dramatic romance of 'Bridgerton,' we do take pride in maintaining a refined atmosphere. I'd be happy to provide you with our special notepaper and a proper fountain pen for your research - much more suitable than those modern devices, don't you think? The jasmine tea will be ready shortly, and do let me know if you'd like any assistance navigating the archives.
[B]: OMG fountain pen？That's so vintage chic！🖋️✨ 我平时都用phone notes，but这次我要go full historical mode！😂 谢谢你的help，你真的是the best hotel staff ever！💯 等我的new video出来，我一定要dedicate it to this amazing experience！
[A]: Oh my, while I'm truly touched by your kind words, I must gently remind you that we maintain a rather discreet profile here at the hotel. Perhaps instead of a dedication, you might simply cherish the memories of your research time with us? Now, shall I have the tea brought to you in the library, or would you prefer the garden terrace? The wisteria is in full bloom this time of year - quite inspiring for historical reflections.
[B]: Aww okay~ 那我会keep the memories in my heart！💖 Garden terrace sounds perfect！那些wisteria flowers肯定能give me major aesthetic inspo！✨ 谢谢你being so sweet，我promise会behave like a proper historical scholar！📚😂
[A]: What a charming attitude! I'll have our staff prepare the terrace immediately - we'll set up at the wrought iron table beneath the wisteria arbor. And might I suggest our lavender shortbread to accompany your tea? It's baked using a recipe from our 1920s guestbook. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go arrange everything while you gather your research materials. Do take your time - proper scholarship should never be rushed, after all.
[B]: OMG 1920s recipe？That's so legit！💯 我已经can't wait要try了！✨ 谢谢你的perfect安排，你真的是the ultimate hospitality goals！🌸 我现在就去grab my notebook，see you at the terrace！😂📖
[A]: Splendid! I'll meet you at the terrace shortly. And might I suggest leaving that modern vernacular at the door? The garden does tend to inspire more... shall we say, period-appropriate expressions. Until then, I remain your devoted concierge.
[B]: Got it！✨  Verily, I shall endeavor to comport myself with the utmost propriety and grace befitting this noble establishment.  Okay that was my best attempt at old-timey talk！😂 现在off to the garden I go~ 🌸💕
[A]:  My dear, while your enthusiasm is most... creative, perhaps we might find a happy medium between Shakespearean and text-speak? The garden awaits - and remember, the wisteria petals make dreadful confetti, so do resist the temptation. I'll join you presently with the tea service.
[B]: Aye aye, captain！⛵✨ 我会resist all wisteria-related mischief的！😂 (虽然那个pink color真的so Insta-worthy 💖) 等你with the tea哦~ 我已经feel like a proper lady from a Jane Austen novel了！📚💃
