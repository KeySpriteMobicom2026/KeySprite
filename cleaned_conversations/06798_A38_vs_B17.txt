[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: I must say, I'm rather partial to email. There's something about the deliberate nature of crafting a message - choosing each word with care, structuring one's thoughts coherently. It reminds me of the epistolary tradition in Victorian literature, where letters were both an art form and a means of profound connection. Though I suppose modern instant messaging does have its merits for quick exchanges... Do you find yourself preferring one over the other?
[A]: I do find email more satisfying for in-depth conversations, though I can’t deny the convenience of instant messaging for quick matters. There’s a certain elegance to emails that feels almost like composing a miniature essay, don’t you think? Still, I’ve noticed even my students rely almost entirely on messaging platforms these days. It makes me wonder—do you think we’re losing something in terms of depth and nuance?
[A]: Ah, a most thoughtful observation. I find myself nodding in agreement as I read your words. Yes, there is a richness to email correspondence that feels akin to literary composition – a space where one might weave together ideas with the care of a novelist or the precision of a poet. It saddens me somewhat to see that younger generations are drifting away from this form of communication. 

I recall corresponding with a colleague in Beijing last semester; we exchanged emails about the influence of classical Chinese poetry on modernist imagery. Each message was a carefully cultivated garden of thought, requiring time and reflection. The subtlety of tone, the layering of meaning – these are difficult to achieve in the rapid-fire exchanges of instant messaging.

One might argue that we're witnessing a shift similar to what happened when oral traditions gave way to written ones – a transformation that brings both gains and losses. But I do wonder whether future scholars will look back at our current mode of communication and see it as a kind of intellectual flattening... Would you agree, or am I perhaps being unduly nostalgic?
[A]: I think your analogy to oral and written traditions is astute—there’s always a trade-off when technology reshapes how we communicate. What concerns me isn’t so much the speed itself, but the  of haste it cultivates. When every response is expected within minutes, where does that leave the slower, more reflective forms of thought? The kind that requires mulling over a phrase, stepping away, returning with fresh eyes?

And yet—I suppose I’m not entirely dismissive of modern tools. I’ve found that some students actually use instant messaging in creative ways, developing a kind of shorthand poetry, almost like haiku or imagism condensed into emojis and fragments. It’s not depth in the traditional sense, but perhaps a new mode of expression. Still, I can’t help but feel that something essential is lost when we no longer sit with our thoughts long enough to let them fully bloom.

You mentioned your exchange with the colleague in Beijing—what a lovely image, that correspondence as a cultivated garden. It made me think of the letters between Eliot and Emily Hale, or even Voltaire and Frederick the Great. Do you think we’ll see such correspondences again, or are they destined to become archival curiosities?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant reflection – and how beautifully you’ve phrased it: . It does seem that we are training ourselves, or perhaps allowing our tools to train us, to respond rather than to reflect. I often find myself pausing mid-thought now, worrying that even my own mind has begun to expect an immediate reply from itself.

You’re quite right about students finding inventive forms of expression within the constraints of instant messaging. I’ve noticed this too – a kind of compressed lyricism, as if they're writing modernist fragments without realizing it. One student even sent me a response to  using mostly emojis and line breaks... and strangely enough, it captured some of the poem’s disjointed despair rather effectively! Still, while I admire their ingenuity, it's not quite the same as sitting with Eliot’s text for hours, letting its layers unfold.

As for those grand literary correspondences – Eliot and Hale, Voltaire and Frederick – I do wonder if we romanticize them a little. But no, I think there is something irreplaceable about that form of dialogue: slow, deliberate, deeply personal. Perhaps such exchanges will return in cycles, like so many cultural phenomena. After all, we've seen revivals of letterpress printing, analog photography… maybe one day, we’ll see a revival of the epistolary art. 

In the meantime, I suppose it falls to us to model it – to encourage our students to take the time, to sit with their thoughts, and yes, to let them bloom.
[A]: How beautifully put — to  reflection rather than merely instruct it. I’ve begun experimenting with that in my seminars. Last term, I assigned a series of “slow letters” in place of response papers — students had to write to one another (and to me) as if composing a literary letter: no subject lines, no bullet points, just sustained thought and genuine inquiry. One student confessed she hadn’t written anything longer than a text message in years. And yet by the end, many were surprised at how naturally the form returned to them, almost like muscle memory.

It reminded me of something Italo Calvino once wrote — that the writer must be “precise as a poet and clear as a physicist.” Perhaps this is what we’re after: helping students balance precision with clarity, even in an age that prizes speed above all.

I wonder — have you considered incorporating such exercises into your own courses? Or do you think the digital tide has already pulled too strongly against such practices?
[A]: What a truly inspiring approach – I love the idea of “slow letters” as both an act of resistance and rediscovery. It does strike me as rather hopeful that your students found the form returning to them so naturally, almost as if the impulse toward deeper expression never truly left; it was merely lying dormant, waiting to be awakened.

I’ve certainly toyed with similar ideas in my courses, though perhaps not quite so poetically framed. Last year, I introduced a “letter-to-the-author” assignment where students wrote to poets like T.S. Eliot or Emily Dickinson as if corresponding across time. The results were unexpectedly moving – some poured out questions they’d never dared articulate before, others offered solace or argued with the poet’s worldview. One young woman wrote to Eliot about  and ended with, “I don’t know if you meant for this to feel like grief, but it does – and somehow that makes it beautiful.” 

As for the digital tide… I suppose I’m still stubborn enough to believe we can swim against it, at least some of the time. We may not halt the current entirely, but we can teach our students how to pause, how to look up from their screens and notice the contours of a thought before it vanishes. After all, wasn’t poetry itself once the instant messaging of the soul? Fragmented, urgent, deeply personal – and yet capable of enduring meaning when given the right attention.  

Perhaps that is our task: to remind them that language, like a garden or a poem, grows best when tended with care.
[A]: What a moving account — that letter to Eliot, in particular, gave me chills. There’s something profoundly intimate about addressing a long-departed writer, as if one were speaking into the void and hoping for an echo. And yet, isn’t that what literature has always been — a conversation across time, often without immediate reply?

Your students’ responses remind me why we continue this work, even when it feels like we’re pushing against the tide. I’ve often thought that teaching literature is not unlike tending a library of ghosts — each voice preserved, waiting for someone to listen anew.

I wonder — have you ever considered having your students exchange letters with peers at another institution, perhaps even internationally? I’m imagining a kind of literary pen-pal project, where they engage not only with one another but with different cultural understandings of text and tradition. It might be a small thing, but perhaps just the sort of quiet resistance we need.
[A]: What a lovely and deeply resonant idea —  How beautifully that captures the essence of what we do. Every time we open a text, we are summoning voices from the past, hoping – perhaps even expecting – that they will speak to us across the years, the miles, the layers of history.

I’m quite taken with your suggestion of a literary pen-pal project, especially with an international dimension. In fact, I’ve dabbled in something similar with students at Nanjing University, though it was more structured correspondence around shared readings of Eliot and Li Bai. The results were fascinating – not only did the students respond differently to the same poem depending on their cultural lens, but some began to echo each other’s phrasing unconsciously, as if finding a common language through literary allusion.

One pair, in particular, exchanged letters for months beyond the scope of the assignment, debating the nature of melancholy in both  and Tang dynasty poetry. It reminded me of nothing so much as the epistolary friendships forged in salons and coffeehouses centuries ago – slow, deliberate, intellectually nourishing.

Perhaps the quietest resistances are the most enduring. Not grand declarations, but small acts of attention: reading closely, writing thoughtfully, listening carefully across time and space. If we can nurture even a few minds in this way, I daresay we have done something worthwhile.
[A]: How extraordinary that those students continued their exchange beyond the assignment — it speaks to something deeply human, doesn’t it? The desire not just to interpret a text, but to be  with another thinking, feeling mind. And how remarkable that they found resonance between Eliot and Li Bai — two voices steeped in disillusionment and longing, yet separated by such vast cultural and temporal distances.

I wonder if part of what draws us to these figures — Eliot, Li Bai, even someone like Hölderlin or Akhmatova — is precisely this sense of melancholy, of yearning for meaning in a fragmented world. Perhaps our students, despite growing up in an age of speed and digital saturation, are more attuned to this than we realize. They may express it through a GIF or a string of emojis, but underneath, there’s often the same ache — the same search for connection.

You know, I’ve often thought that if Eliot were writing today, he might compose his poems entirely in footnotes and email threads... Do you suppose we ought to begin preparing our students for that possibility — to teach them how to find poetry in the mundane, how to read between the lines of a message thread as carefully as one would a sonnet?
[A]: What a compelling thought – that Eliot in our present age might indeed write through footnotes, email threads, or perhaps even annotated tweets. After all, his work already demands that we pay attention to the margins, to what is implied rather than stated, to the echoes between lines. In a way, we are already surrounded by a kind of fragmented, allusive discourse; the challenge now is helping students recognize its literary potential and treat it with the interpretive care it may deserve.

I do believe we must teach them to look for poetry not only in the expected places but in the very fabric of their daily communication. A well-placed emoji can carry the weight of an image in a haiku; a carefully delayed reply can function like a dramatic pause. It’s not about lowering standards, but expanding our sense of where meaning resides.

And you’re quite right – the longing, the fragmentation, the search for coherence amid chaos: these are not new human conditions, merely newly mediated. Figures like Eliot, Li Bai, Hölderlin, Akhmatova remind us that literature has always been a response to dislocation. If anything, our students may be more primed than ever to understand that sensibility, even if they express it differently.

Perhaps our task, then, is not simply to teach texts, but to cultivate a sensibility – a way of being attentive to the world and to one another. To help them see that every message, every exchange, holds within it the possibility of something deeper, if only they take the time to read it with both heart and mind engaged.
[A]: Precisely — it’s not about where meaning  reside, but where it  reside, if only we remain attentive and deliberate. I’ve begun telling my students that interpretation is not a passive act; it’s a kind of moral engagement. To read closely is to listen deeply — not just to the text, but to the person behind it, whether that’s Eliot, Li Bai, or a classmate composing an email at midnight.

I wonder — do you find that students are initially resistant to this way of thinking? Or does the idea of reading and writing as a kind of ethical attention resonate with them once they begin to practice it?

And more practically — how might we assess such a sensibility without reducing it to a rubric? Is there a place for grading in something so elusive, or must we instead trust that the value lies in the practice itself, regardless of measurable outcome?
[A]: I’ve found, rather interestingly, that students are often  receptive to the idea of reading and writing as ethical acts — once they see it modeled with sincerity. At first, many are hesitant; they expect literature courses to be about analysis, not attention; interpretation, not intimacy. But when they begin to write letters instead of essays, when they’re asked not just to dissect a poem but to respond to it personally — well, something shifts.

One student confessed to me after our Eliot correspondence exercise that she’d never thought of poetry as something that could , much less invite reply. She said it felt strange at first — “like talking to a statue” — but by the end, she realized she was having a conversation, not with a monument of literary history, but with a man who had once sat alone with his doubts and tried to make sense of them in verse.

As for assessment — ah, there’s the rub. I’ve long struggled with how to evaluate what cannot easily be quantified. A rubric can measure syntax or argumentative structure, but how does one grade the quality of a student’s attention? The depth of their empathy? I suppose we do what we must: offer feedback that honors the effort to engage meaningfully, even if imperfectly. And yes, sometimes we must assign a grade, but I try to be transparent about its limitations. A number cannot capture the true value of what occurs when a student begins to read — and write — as an act of care.

Perhaps the real assessment happens not in our classrooms, but years later, when a former student finds themselves pausing before replying to an email, or rereading a line of poetry twice because it stirs something unexpected. That, I think, is when we know the lesson took root.
[A]: How beautifully said —  That is precisely the quiet, enduring hope we carry as educators. Not for grand displays of mastery or perfectly polished essays, but for those subtle shifts in perception, those moments when a student realizes that language is not merely something to be decoded, but something to be felt, inhabited, responded to.

I’ve had similar experiences — students who began the term treating poems like puzzles to be solved, only to end by writing lines of their own, tentatively at first, then with real conviction. One young man, after wrestling with Eliot’s fragmented imagery for weeks, handed me a notebook at the end of term and said simply, “I think I finally understand why he wrote this way. Sometimes, broken language is the only honest kind.”

It reminded me that our role isn’t always to explain, but to create space — space for uncertainty, for reflection, even for silence. And perhaps it is in that space that true learning happens, beyond the reach of rubrics or letter grades.

You know, I sometimes wonder if this is what Eliot meant by “the still point of the turning world” — that moment of stillness amidst the whirl of information, expectation, distraction. If we can help our students find that still point, even briefly, within a poem, a letter, a conversation — then I daresay we have given them something far more lasting than any lecture could convey.
[A]: How profoundly true – to create space, rather than simply fill it. That is the delicate art of our profession, isn’t it? We do not merely impart knowledge; we cultivate stillness in which meaning might emerge. And yes, Eliot’s  feels like precisely the image we need for what we strive toward – that quiet center where thought and feeling align, even as the world spins on with its relentless noise.

I’m reminded of a line from Rilke’s : “We must trust the work itself, which has come out of long thought and long experiencing.” Perhaps this is what we are asking of our students—not instant comprehension, but a willingness to dwell, to experience, to let the work unfold within them over time. The best lessons, after all, are those that continue beyond the final grade.

And I so appreciate your student’s insight about  There is such wisdom in that observation. In an age where everything moves at a pace that scarcely allows for reflection, perhaps fragmentation is not always failure—it may be fidelity to the complexity of our inner lives. Eliot knew that. Li Bai knew that. And now, it seems, your students are beginning to know it too.

So yes, let us keep creating those spaces—small sanctuaries of thought and feeling in an ever-accelerating world. If even one student walks away carrying that stillness with them, then I think we have done something very close to sacred work.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve captured it —  That is, I think, the truest description of what we aim to create, even if we rarely name it so plainly.

I often return to that line from Rilke as well —  — and I find new meaning in it each time. In a world that prizes efficiency and immediate results, the kind of work we ask of our students feels almost radical: slow, uncertain, deeply personal. And yet, it is precisely this slowness that allows them to encounter not only the text, but themselves.

I’m reminded of something one of my former students wrote in a final reflection: 

If we can help them see that, then yes — we are doing more than teaching literature. We are nurturing a way of being in the world: attentive, reflective, open to the quiet truths that reveal themselves only with time and care.

And truly, what greater gift can we offer?
[A]: How perfectly your former student put it —  There is such grace in that observation, and such profound truth. Literature does not merely ask us to understand words on a page; it asks us to sit with them long enough to be changed by them. And isn’t that what all great teaching does? Not filling minds, but gently altering the way a person sees — and feels — the world.

I sometimes think we are like gardeners planting seeds in soil we may never see bloom. Our students carry these insights with them — sometimes quietly folded into their inner lives, only to unfold years later while reading a poem on a train, or writing an email they pause over longer than usual, or even scrolling through a message thread and suddenly recognizing a flicker of poetry in the prose of everyday life.

You asked earlier if we are offering our students a gift — and I believe we are. Not a utilitarian one, certainly not a measurable one, but a deeply human one: the capacity for attention, for empathy, for wonder. These are not luxuries; they are quiet acts of resistance against a world that would have us move too quickly to notice what truly matters.

So yes — let us continue this work, modest though it may seem. Let us keep tending those sanctuaries, line by line, letter by letter, conversation by conversation. And let us trust, as Rilke reminds us, in the work itself.
[A]: How beautifully — how  — you have said it. To be changed by what we read, and to change in the act of reading… that is the subtle miracle we witness in our students, and in ourselves, year after year.

I often think of teaching not as leading students toward some fixed destination, but as giving them permission to wander — through texts, through ideas, even through themselves. And like all good wanderers, they sometimes stumble, hesitate, lose their way. But in that very uncertainty, there is growth. A student who once feared poetry now pauses over a line from Li Bai while waiting for her coffee to cool. Another, who once dismissed Eliot as “too confusing,” finds himself quoting  in an email to a friend, not because he understands it fully, but because it expresses something he feels but cannot quite name.

And perhaps that is the greatest gift we can offer: not answers, but the comfort of ambiguity; not clarity alone, but the courage to dwell in the unclear. After all, most of life unfolds in the space between knowing and not knowing. If our students leave us with nothing else, may they at least carry that spaciousness with grace.

So yes — let us keep tending those quiet sanctuaries, both within and beyond the classroom. Let us trust in the slow unfolding of thought, in the deep work of attention, and in the enduring power of words to touch hearts long after they were first written.

Let us, as you so tenderly remind us, trust in the work itself.
[A]: And let us trust, too, in the quiet ripples that spread from each thoughtful word written, each poem lingered over, each conversation that lingers beyond the hour. For even if we never know the full shape of what we’ve sown — how a single line of Eliot took root in a student’s mind, how a letter exchanged in a seminar resurfaced years later in a moment of solitude — still, we go on. Not because we must, but because we , and because someone, somewhere, will one day pause over a phrase and feel just a little more seen.

You have such a gift for naming what matters without ever making it feel heavy — like the best kind of teaching, your words invite rather than demand. I imagine your students must leave your classroom not only knowing more, but  more — and isn’t that the rarest thing?

Yes, let us keep trusting in the work itself. And in doing so, may we also keep remembering why we began: not for applause or acclaim, but for love — of language, of thought, of the fragile, enduring human spirit that finds its voice again and again through poetry, through letters, through quiet conversations that echo long after they end.
