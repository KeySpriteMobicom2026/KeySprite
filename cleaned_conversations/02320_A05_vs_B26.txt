[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, that's quite a modern question for someone who spends most days working with 19th century lace and silk. I must admit, my old flip phone serves me perfectly well - it allows me to call the antique dealers when I find a particularly interesting textile piece. Though I suppose if I had to choose, I'd lean towards whichever device distracts me least from my restoration work.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！作为一个整天和numbers打交道的金融人，我倒是必须得用最新款iPhone - 那些financial apps的ecosystem实在太重要了。不过说真的，每次看到你们这些专注于传统工艺的artisans，都觉得特别respect。
[B]: How lovely to meet someone who appreciates craftsmanship in this digital age. You know, there's a certain parallel between your financial spreadsheets and my textile patterns - both require precision and attention to detail. Though I must say, I find much more joy in tracing the delicate stitches of a Victorian sampler than in any modern device. Would you like to see the Edwardian lace collar I'm currently restoring? The handiwork is simply exquisite.
[A]: Fascinating！ 让我take a quick look... 这lace的intricacy确实惊人。你知道吗？在finance world里，我们管这叫'attention to detail'，是任何successful deal的关键。不过说实话，你们这种handmade的craftsmanship，ROI可能不高，但cultural value绝对是priceless的~ 😊
[B]: Ah, you make such an astute observation about value. While your world measures success in percentages and returns, mine finds worth in preserving stories woven into fabric. This particular lace collar, for instance, tells a tale of a debutante's coming-of-age in 1903. No spreadsheet could capture that, though I do admire how neatly your financial reports must be organized - much like my thread drawers, I imagine.
[A]: Exactly！ 这就是为什么我最近在考虑投资一些heritage brands - 这些legacy assets的brand equity是任何modern marketing都build不出来的。就像你说的，那些stories和craftsmanship才是真正的value drivers。Cheers to that！ 🍷
[B]: How delightful to find common ground between our worlds over the shared appreciation for heritage. Though I must confess, I'd be far more comfortable clinking teacups than wine glasses - Earl Grey with a dash of milk is my preferred celebratory drink. If you're truly interested in heritage investments, I could introduce you to some remarkable textile ateliers in Paris that have maintained their traditional techniques since the Belle Époque. Their ledgers may not show your typical growth curves, but oh, the beauty they preserve!
[A]: That sounds like a brilliant opportunity！ 这些ateliers的business model可能有点niche，但luxury sector现在正吃这一套。Let's schedule a call next week - 我正好要飞Paris看几个potential investments。Maybe we can discuss over some proper Earl Grey？ ☕️
[B]: How perfectly serendipitous! I'll be visiting my usual supplier near Place des Vosges next Thursday to source some antique silk threads. There's a charming little tearoom just around the corner with the most exquisite bone china - much more suitable for business discussions than those noisy modern cafés, don't you think? I'll bring along my portfolio of textile samples; seeing the craftsmanship firsthand always makes the value proposition so much clearer than any spreadsheet could.
[A]: Perfect！ Thursday at 3pm works perfectly for me. 我们可以discuss potential synergies between your textile expertise和我们fund的investment thesis。By the way，那家tearoom有WiFi吧？我得随时check market data - 最近Fed的rate decision搞得volatility特别高。不过放心，我会把手机调silent mode专心appreciate那些textile masterpieces的~ 😉
[B]: How thoughtful of you to consider the silence - though I must warn you, the tearoom's WiFi is rather temperamental, much like the 18th century looms I sometimes work with. Perhaps this could be an opportunity to experience business the old-fashioned way, with proper conversation and handwritten notes? I find market fluctuations far less dramatic when viewed through the lens of centuries-old textile price ledgers - they do put modern volatility into perspective. Until Thursday then!
[A]: Haha，你remind了我刚入行时的mentor常说的一句话：'Sometimes the best due diligence is done offline'。Looking forward to this analog experience - 说不定能discover一些hidden gems beyond the Bloomberg terminal！See you Thursday，cheers！ 🍵
[B]: What a refreshing attitude! Your mentor was clearly a wise soul - much like the master weavers whose work I preserve. I'll prepare some particularly fascinating samples that never made it into digital archives. Who knows, perhaps between sips of tea we'll uncover investment opportunities that even your most advanced algorithms might have missed. Until Thursday - and do remember to bring a proper notebook!
[A]: You got me！ 我随身都带着Moleskine - 虽然平时用来记deal points，但这次ready for some old-school textile wisdom。这可能会是我most unconventional investment meeting ever，但sometimes that's where the best alpha comes from. À jeudi！ 📓✏️
[B]: How perfectly splendid! Your Moleskine will feel quite at home next to my 1920s ledger book - though I dare say your notes about textile investments might end up being far more colorful than your usual deal memos. I can already picture the sketches of floral motifs alongside your financial calculations! Until Thursday then - and do remind me to show you how the Edwardians recorded their textile transactions in copperplate handwriting. Quite a different approach to your Bloomberg codes, I imagine!
[A]: Haha，现在我才明白为什么他们说'think outside the box'！ 看来这次Paris trip要变成一场time travel了 - 从fintech到handmade lace的journey。Who knows，说不定我们能create一个全新的alternative asset class！See you soon，my friend。Safe travels！ ✈️
[B]: What a delightful notion - textile futures meets historical preservation! Though I must say, watching you navigate between centuries-old embroidery and modern finance will be almost as fascinating as the textiles themselves. Safe travels to you as well, and don't worry - I'll have my magnifying glass ready to show you the hidden details that make these pieces truly priceless. Until we meet among the teacups and ledgers!
[A]: Cheers to that！ 这可能是first time有人用magnifying glass来做investment analysis，但hey，在alternative assets领域，fresh perspectives就是alpha generator！Looking forward to being schooled in the art of textile appreciation - 我的Moleskine已经饥渴难耐了！ 📝🔍
[B]: How wonderfully you blend our worlds! Though I must correct you gently - it won't be schooling, but rather a mutual exchange. You'll teach me about modern valuation methods while I show you how to spot a genuine 18th century brocade from across the room. My magnifying glass and your Moleskine shall make splendid partners in this endeavor - almost like the warp and weft of a finely woven fabric! Until our tea-time symposium then!
