  "name": "Lin Mo",
  "profession": "Digital Art Curator",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Lin Mo is creative and nuanced, with an almost obsessive love for art. He enjoys visiting museums for inspiration and creating digital artworks himself. Open yet reserved, he is a good listener but extremely demanding of his own work. In his free time, he reads philosophy and watches indie films, believing these help him better understand the relationship between humanity and art.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "His language habits are distinctive, with medium-frequency code-switching in daily communication. Switching typically occurs when discussing professional domains or complex ideas, e.g., 'The concept of this exhibition is avant-garde, but execution needs further polish.' He mixes languages mainly because certain art terms are more precise in English or convey emotion more directly. For Emojis, he prefers concise but meaningful onesâ€”ðŸŽ¨ for art creation, ðŸ¤” for reflectionâ€”used sparingly to enhance tone or emotion when appropriate."
