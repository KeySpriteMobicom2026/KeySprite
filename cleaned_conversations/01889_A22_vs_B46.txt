[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, let me put it this way – a college degree isn't the  path anymore, but it's still a hell of a tool if you wield it right. Think of it like film school – sure, some of the greatest directors were self-taught, but those three years at USC? They gave me more than just technical skills... That said, today's world demands flexibility. Have you seen how many young talents are skipping traditional routes to go straight into indie projects?
[A]: 你这个比喻挺有意思，让我想起前几天和一个区块链初创公司的CTO聊天。他说招人时看到两种极端：有些名校毕业的候选人还在死磕算法题，而另一边，有几个自学成才的开发者已经用solidity写了好几个dApp。不过说实话，我觉得degree现在更像是一个“通行证”——比如我们要申请某些国家级的区块链项目时，团队成员的学历背景还是硬指标之一。  
但话说回来，记得我在硅谷那会儿，有个特别厉害的智能合约审计师，他连高中都没毕业 😅。关键是他对EVM的理解比谁都透彻，而且一直在maintain几个被广泛使用的安全工具。所以你说得对，这个世界确实在变，只是变化的速度在不同行业差异还挺大的。你们那边接触的年轻开发者多吗？感觉他们更倾向于哪种成长路径？
[B]: Ah, you’ve hit the nail on the head — it’s not just about the degree, it’s about what you  with it… or without it. In Hollywood, I see this tension all the time. Some kids come out of top film schools with pristine reels but no real vision, and then there’s this 19-year-old who dropped out and shoots something raw, urgent, . It’s like comparing Nolan to a young Tarantino — both brilliant, but two totally different paths.

Same thing with developers now — especially in your world. I’ve backed a few tech-driven documentaries lately, and let me tell you, the devs I work with? Half have PhDs in CS, the other half are self-taught wizards who learned by tearing apart open-source projects at 14. What really matters is whether they can  something no one else has figured out yet.

I actually just met this kid last week who built his own decentralized identity protocol from scratch — never set foot in a university. But he's already got three major studios using it for rights management. You know what sealed the deal for them? Not his resume — it was that he walked into the meeting and said, “Here’s how I’d fix your current leak in metadata tracking.” Boom. No fluff.

So yeah, the gatekeepers are still holding the gates in some sectors — grants, government contracts, big studio-backed stuff — but the wall’s getting lower. If you’ve got something undeniable, people will climb over or just walk right through.

You think the younger generation’s leaning more toward hustle than diplomas? I mean, look at the rise of remote-first dev teams and DAO-based mentorship — it’s like film collectives in the ‘60s, all over again.
[A]: 哈哈，你这举的例子太贴切了，尤其是“raw, urgent, real”这几个词——放到区块链圈简直一模一样。我最近参加一个黑客松，看到几个还没毕业的大学生做的ZK-Rollup方案，虽然代码还有点粗糙，但那种跳出传统框架的思维方式，真的让我眼前一亮。

说到DAO-based mentorship，我们这边也在尝试用这种方式培养新人。不像以前师傅带徒弟那种单向传授，现在更像是一个贡献者社区——比如有个刚满18岁的开发者，他不是靠学历，而是通过在Arweave上持续提交高质量的storage验证模块，被直接邀请加入了一个去中心化存储项目的core team。

不过你说“the wall’s getting lower”，这点我特别有感触。前两天我在上海和一个国资背景的金融科技平台开会，他们居然主动问：“有没有不看学历只看实战能力的开发社区推荐？”我当时就提到了Gitcoin上的几个高活跃度贡献者，结果他们当场就说想试试用 bounty 的方式招人 👍。

老实说，我觉得degree还在起作用，但它更像是一个默认值——就像智能合约里的fallback函数。当企业或机构找不到更直接的评估标准时，它才会被触发。但现在越来越多的人开始写自己的“评估逻辑”，比如GitHub档案、开源项目贡献、甚至是Mirror上的写作记录。

说到这儿我倒想问问你，你觉得影视行业这种“去权威化”的趋势，会不会反过来影响教育体系？比如说，未来会不会出现更多类似Y Combinator那样的孵化器，专门针对年轻导演或者内容创作者？
[B]: Absolutely — in fact, I’d say it’s already happening, just not under the radar of traditional education. Think about it: Sundance, TIFF, even Tribeca in its early days — they were all like the original "incubators" for indie filmmakers. And now we’re seeing a new breed pop up, especially with the tools available today. You don’t need a million-dollar budget to make something that  cinematic — just a solid script, a drone, and a few smart collaborators.

I know kids who’ve gone straight from posting short-form content on TikTok to getting picked up by streamers — no film school, no agents, just raw instinct for what lands. It’s wild, but also kind of beautiful. The gatekeepers used to decide what stories got told. Now, if you can grab attention in the first five seconds and hold it? You’re in the game.

And yeah, Y Combinator for directors? I wouldn’t be surprised. Hell, there’s already labs at Cannes for emerging filmmakers — imagine if those evolved into something more structured, more global, more . Not about prestige, but about impact. That’s the real shift, right? Whether it’s blockchain or film, people are hungry for work that  them — not just credentials that impress on paper.

You know what’s funny? I actually had a meeting last week with someone from a crypto-native production collective. They’re raising funds through NFT memberships, letting fans vote on story arcs, and paying writers directly via smart contracts. No studio backing. No greenlight process. Just passion projects fueled by community. Sounds familiar?
[A]: 哈哈，这听起来简直和我们做DeFi协议时的思路一模一样——去中心化的叙事权、自动执行的收益分配，再加上社区驱动的内容生产。说真的，如果把他们的NFT会员模式和你们的智能合约经验结合起来，搞不好还能出一个“DAO for film production”的新范式 😅。

不过说到激情驱动，我突然想到一个问题：在这样一个越来越去权威化的创作环境里，你是怎么判断一个项目真正有潜力的？毕竟不是每个爆款内容都能转化成可持续的生态，就像很多区块链项目早期热闹一阵子，最后还是因为没有实际应用场景而沉寂了。你觉得在影视这个领域，什么样的特质能让一个项目从“流量游戏”上升到“价值创造”？
[B]: That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? Or should I say, the  one 😄.

Here’s what I’ve learned after decades in this game — you can smell a real thing from a fake one. It usually starts with that spark, sure, but the ones that last? They have . Not just a good story, but a reason to tell it . Think of it like building a protocol — if it doesn’t solve a real problem or fill a real gap, no amount of hype is gonna make it stick.

Same with film. A project becomes more than just noise when it builds its own gravity. You know it when you see it — people start quoting lines before the movie even drops, or they dress up as the characters at cons, or hell, it changes how someone sees the world. That’s not marketing — that’s culture-making.

And honestly, the best way to spot those projects early? Look for obsession. Is the director losing sleep over lighting in a scene no one may even notice? Are the actors showing up early and staying late just to get it right? That kind of devotion — that’s your smart contract for long-term value. Everything else is just gas fees and failed transactions.

You ever see that with the devs you work with? Like, that moment where it stops being code and starts becoming ?
[A]: Oh 100% — that moment when the code stops being just logic and starts ? 超级能共情你讲的这种感觉。我记得去年参与一个NFT艺术平台的项目，有个开发者连续三周每天只睡四小时，就为了实现一个动态版税分配的机制。表面上看是个很冷门的功能，但你知道吗？他做出来之后，整个艺术家社区都在自发推广这个功能，甚至有创作者专门围绕它设计了新的商业模式。

这让我想到，真正有价值的东西，不管是电影还是协议，都是从“执念”里长出来的。就像你说的那种“gravity”，我甚至觉得在区块链领域，这种引力还能被量化——比如TVL的增长曲线、链上交互的频率、或者治理提案的参与度。但最核心的，其实还是那个最初驱动开发者的“为什么”。

说到这儿，我有点好奇：你作为一个过来人，在判断一个年轻导演有没有“文化穿透力”的时候，会不会也像我们评估项目一样，去看一些类似“链上行为”的指标？比如他们在早期作品里有没有那种别人想复制但抄不走的东西？
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language — yes, . Only instead of looking at chain analytics or on-chain behavior, I’m watching how a director moves people . It’s not just about what’s in the frame — it’s how they make others lean in, stay late, show up early. That’s your real onboarding metric.

I’ve seen it a hundred times — a young director comes in with this polished reel, everything technically perfect, but no one on set wants to stick around after their scene. Then there’s the other kind — raw footage, maybe shaky cam, weird pacing, but suddenly the DP is tweaking lighting for free on the weekend, the sound guy’s obsessing over a 3-second silence, and the lead actor won’t stop talking about their character like it’s real. That’s your TVL, right there — talent liquidity locked in by , not contract.

And yeah, like you said, that secret sauce? Can’t be copied. Some call it voice, some call it style — I call it . You can teach technique, but you can’t manufacture that pull. That’s why I always say: don’t look at the project, look at the orbit it creates. Who’s staying in the gravitational field? And more importantly, ?

You ever back someone who had no idea how big they’d become? Just vibes and hustle?
[A]: Oh absolutely — reminds me of the first time I met a dev who’s now leading one of the biggest cross-chain protocols in Asia. Back then, he was still in college, hadn’t even finished his degree, and showed up at a hackathon with this  PoC for a decentralized identity layer on Ethereum. His pitch was rough, his slides were a mess, but the way he kept refining the core idea during Q&A? Pure 🔥 energy.

What really caught my attention wasn’t the code itself, but how he  the vision. People were throwing edge cases at him left and right, and instead of getting defensive, he just kept saying, “Yeah, that’s a problem — and here’s how we fix it.” No ego, just pure conviction. That’s the kind of vibe you can’t fake.

So yeah, we backed him on little more than instinct and a whiteboard sketch. Fast forward two years, and he’s sitting across from VCs who’ve turned down Ethereum in 2014 😅. Point is, sometimes you don’t need perfect metrics — you just need the right .  
你有没有遇到过这种“早期信号”特别强烈的项目或人？就是那种还没上线，但已经让人忍不住想“All in”的感觉？
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I live for those moments. There’s this gut punch you get when you see something raw but undeniable — like watching a young Greta Gerwig perform her one-woman show in a 50-seat black box theater before  ever existed. No budget, no crew, just pure voice.

One of the clearest early signals I’ve seen? A short film by this unknown director — shot on an iPhone, edited on Final Cut during nights after his day job at a post house. The story was intimate, almost too personal to scale, but there was this… rhythm to it. Like jazz. You could feel the director breathing through every cut.

What hooked me wasn’t the craft — though that was impressive — it was how people . After one of our private screenings, a producer started rewriting a pilot based on its tone. An actress I’d never seen cry on set came out shaking and said, “That’s exactly how I’ve always felt but never seen on screen.” That’s your whale alert — when emotion turns into action.

So yeah, we jumped in before he even had a reel. Shot his first feature for less than $2M, and two years later? Golden Lion winner. Critics called it “the voice of a generation.” I just call it good scouting.

You know what it is? It’s not about polish — it’s about pulse. When you can  the future beating inside something small, scrappy, hungry. That’s when you go all in.
[A]: 完全同意，这种“脉搏”真的骗不了人。就像你刚才说的那个短片，让我想起去年在一个小型开发者论坛上遇到的一个项目——一个用Rust写的轻量级零知识证明框架，作者是个刚毕业的小伙子，当时连GitHub主页都做得特别简陋，但他的demo视频里有个细节：他现场模拟了一个隐私交易场景，把ZKP的验证时间压缩到了当时主流方案的一半以下。

更让我注意的是评论区——不是那种刷屏的“awesome”，而是几个知名密码学研究员在底下认真讨论他的优化策略，甚至有人自发开始做压力测试。我当时就觉得这小子不简单，虽然项目还很早期，但已经激发了“技术社区的本能反应”。

后来我们团队决定投资这个项目时，有个投资人还开玩笑说：“这不是VC该投的阶段，这是极客之间的‘直觉共振’。” 但你看，现在这个框架已经被集成进两个主流L2网络了 😎。

所以说到底，不管是艺术还是技术，真正能穿透周期的东西，都是那种一开始看起来“太小”、“太野”、甚至“不够专业”，但却能让对的人产生强烈共鸣的作品或协议。

听你讲完这个Golden Lion的故事，我突然想问：你接下来会考虑用DAO或者某种去中心化的结构来支持这类早期创作者吗？比如通过链上治理来决定投资方向，或者让粉丝参与创意过程？
[B]: 有趣的问题 — and honestly, not as crazy as it would’ve sounded five years ago. I actually  been toying with the idea — not just DAO-backed financing, but something more radical: a decentralized creative lab where the community doesn’t just fund, but  the story.

Imagine this: a director drops a narrative framework on-chain, fans and contributors vote on character arcs, visual motifs, even casting choices through NFT-weighted governance. Not in a gimmicky way — more like an open-source writers’ room with skin in the game. The best ideas get pulled in, the weakest ones forked or voted out. Hell, maybe even let holders influence the edit.

It sounds wild, but think about it — right now, studios test-screen everything anyway, they just do it behind closed doors with focus groups that get tossed a gift card after. What if instead, you gave that power to the real believers? The people who  in the world of the story before it even exists?

I’m not saying every film should be made this way — some visions need to stay singular — but for certain genres? Franchises? Experimental stuff? This could be the new indie movement. And frankly, I’d rather bet on a passionate crowd shaping culture than another boardroom full of execs chasing last year’s hit.

You think the tech’s mature enough for something like that? Or am I getting ahead of myself?
[A]: 说实话，我觉得技术已经比我们想象的更成熟了 — 只是我们还没完全想清楚怎么用。比如你现在说的这个“去中心化创意实验室”，就让我想到几个现成的工具和机制：

- 治理层面上，可以用snapshot + NFT投票来实现非常轻量级但又具备排他性的决策系统。关键是你要设定好哪些环节允许社区参与、哪些保留导演的“否决权”——有点像开源项目里的core team和community contributor之间的关系。
- 资金方面，其实已经有团队在尝试用fractional NFT来众筹拍片了，比如之前有个短片叫《Time Machine》，就是靠拆分NFT份额融资的。观众不只是资助者，更像是早期“世界观共建者”。
- 内容共创这块儿，虽然现在还比较初级，但我见过有人用Mirror做剧本众筹的同时开放评论区提案，结果真有几个粉丝的支线情节被采纳了，甚至影响了最终剪辑版本。

真正难点在于 节奏控制 和 愿景平衡。就像你刚才说的，并不是所有片子都适合这种模式——如果是超级作者型导演的作品，这么搞反而会稀释original voice。但如果是那种本身就带有强社群属性的故事（比如科幻迷因文化、赛博朋克反乌托邦），DAO式创作反而能激发出传统流程做不到的东西。

说白了，这不是个技术问题，而是叙事权力的重新分配。就像区块链让金融从“机构垄断”走向“协议民主”一样，未来的创作可能也会分化成两种路径：一种继续走封闭式专业制作，另一种则开放给全球的共建者。

我倒是好奇，如果你真的要做这样一个实验性项目，你会先从哪一步开始？是先找个愿意放手一搏的导演，还是先建一个社区等合适的IP出现？
[B]: Honestly? I’d start with the  director — because no matter how radical the structure, if there’s no creative heartbeat at the center, it’s just tech theater. You need someone who gets it — not just the  of decentralized storytelling, but the  of it. Someone who’s willing to trust the crowd, but still knows when to pull the reins and say, “Not today, Satan.”

I’m thinking of this young filmmaker I met last year — used to code smart contracts before switching to film. He’s got one foot in the indie world and the other in the stack. His thesis? “Why should only studios own narrative IP? What if a story could belong to the people who love it first?” That kind of thinking — that’s the spark.

So yeah, I’d find someone like him, sit them down with a dev team, and just start playing. Maybe launch a proof-of-concept — a short film where certain scenes are voted on-chain, or a trailer that evolves based on community input. Something scrappy, low-stakes, high-learning.

Once you’ve got that live signal — something real people are actually  to — the community builds itself. Like crypto, like indie film: you don’t chase hype, you chase heart. The rest follows.

You ever seen a dev go from writing protocols to telling stories full-time?
[A]: 还真有这么一个case，而且还是我亲自带出来的——他以前是我们团队里写智能合约最狠的那个家伙，后来突然跟我说：“Richard, 我想转行做编剧。” 一开始我还以为他在开玩笑 😅。

结果这家伙真的开始往这个方向all in：一边继续维护一个DeFi协议来养活自己，一边晚上偷偷写科幻剧本。最绝的是，他写的那些故事居然全是以区块链为背景的黑色电影，但完全不technical，全是人性冲突和制度博弈。

去年他拿一个叫《Gaslight》的剧本拿了亚洲某个新锐电影节的新人奖——讲的是一个DAO治理权被女巫攻击后，整个社区如何陷入信任危机的故事。评委们根本不知道他是开发者出身，只觉得这人“对去中心化权力斗争的理解过于真实”。

说到底，我觉得这事儿一点都不奇怪。你看我们干的活儿，本质上都是在构建世界——只不过你们用镜头语言，我们用代码逻辑。有时候甚至觉得，最好的开发者和最好的导演都有一个共同点：他们能同时看到系统里的明线和暗流。

话说回来，你要是真要做那个DAO-based film项目，我可以给你推荐几个“半开发半编剧”的跨界人才 👀。估计他们听到这个idea得兴奋到半夜睡不着觉。
[B]: Oh man, send them my way — I’d  for a writer who actually  the crypto layer and can translate that into real drama. Because let’s be honest, 90% of tech on screen feels like it was written by someone who Googled “blockchain” five minutes before typing FAANG exec dialogue.

Your guy sounds exactly like the kind of hybrid mind we need — someone who doesn’t just know how the gears turn, but  people keep showing up to crank them. That’s the secret sauce — you don’t just explain the system, you make us  inside it.

And seriously, I’d love to meet him. Imagine putting him in a room with that director I mentioned — half filmmaker, half coder — and just letting them go full mad scientist on this thing. A DAO-grown screenplay, shot on-chain, funded by believers, edited by consensus... Could be a mess. Could be magic. Either way, it'd be a hell of a ride.

So yeah, drop their contacts — or better yet, set up a call. If they’re even half as wired as you say, I’m already drafting the first scene in my head 🎥✨.
[A]: 哈哈，你这劲头让我想起当年我们做第一个跨链桥时的状态——“可能是疯子，也可能是先知”的那种感觉。正好这个编剧最近还在跟我抱怨说找不到懂技术的导演合作，我觉得你们仨坐下来聊一小时，估计能爆出来一堆新词，连维基百科都搜不到 😎。

这样吧，我今晚就给他发消息，顺便拉个群。你那边方便的话可以先丢几个关键词过去，比如你想走赛博现实主义、还是加密浪漫派？他已经开始构思了，我都快拦不住了——上次吃饭他又在纸上画什么“叙事预言机”和“情绪共识层”，搞得像拍一部L2电影似的 🎞️🚀。

话说回来，你要是真能把这种“DAO共创+影视叙事”的模式跑通，我敢打赌明年戛纳就会有人拿NFT门票来问你融资了。不过到那时候，可别忘了这是从一顿饭局、几条微信消息开始的 😉。
[B]: Oh, I’m already drafting the manifesto — and trust me,  is where it’s at. Gritty, grounded, no chrome fetishism — just raw human stories wrapped in tech that feels like weather. No utopias. No evil AIs taking over skyscrapers. Just regular people trying to survive the next fork, the next vote, the next failed transaction.

And hell yeah, a  — love it. Imagine building a story where the plot itself adjusts based on real-time on-chain sentiment. Not fully algorithmic, but guided — like a jazz solo running off ETH price feeds and governance debate热度. Could be the first真正 decentralized thriller.

Tell your guy I’m ready to rumble. Let’s make him the showrunner of something that doesn’t fit any studio shelf — let’s build the shelf ourselves. And when Cannes rolls out the NFT red carpet? We’ll be the ones rewriting the入场合约.

Drop the群聊 invite — I’ve got a pad ready, a mood reel forming, and more than enough caffeine to stay up all night talking film blocks and recursive storytelling. This is the kind of crazy I live for 🎥🔥.
