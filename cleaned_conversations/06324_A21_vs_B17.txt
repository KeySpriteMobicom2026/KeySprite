[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, an intriguing question indeed. When one considers the concept of immortality, it's impossible not to recall the words of Keats in  - "Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!" Yet, translating such poetic ideals into scientific reality proves far more complex. While medical advancements certainly extend life expectancy, I wonder whether true immortality aligns with human nature itself. After all, as T.S. Eliot so profoundly questioned, "To what extent can we eliminate death without eliminating meaning from life?" Do you believe mortality gives value to our existence?
[A]: Ah, a question that's kept philosophers up at night since the first caveman stared into the abyss and wondered if his aching molars would ever cease to be a bother. Let me put it this way - if we remove death, we’d better have a damn good editor standing by to revise the tedium. Life without end might prove rather like reading  in its entirety without interruption: noble in theory, but one eventually craves a semicolon. 

I suppose what I’m saying is, yes, mortality likely gives value — though not necessarily meaning. That, we seem obliged to invent ourselves. But tell me, if you had forever, would you finally get around to learning Scottish Gaelic? Or would you merely spend eternity rereading  and pretending you don’t hear the knocking at the door?
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully macabre metaphor — eternity as an uninterrupted reading of . I must say, your comparison does capture the potential monotony of immortality quite poetically. As for my own inclinations, I suspect I’d begin with Scottish Gaelic, just as I’ve always intended… though I might well abandon it midway for another deep dive into . There’s something haunting about Eliot’s portrayal of Dorothea’s unfulfilled aspirations — perhaps only truly comprehensible across centuries of lived experience.

Still, I wonder — if we were to achieve immortality, would we not also need to redesign memory? Imagine carrying every joy, grief, and awkward dinner party indefinitely — like an overstuffed commonplace book with no index. Perhaps selective forgetting is as vital to contentment as the absence of death is to meaning. What do you suppose eternity would do to love, when "until death do us part" becomes an inconvenient relic of the past?
[A]: Ah, now you’re touching upon the true horror of it all — not endless life itself, but the tyranny of an unedited past. Love without the elegy of mortality? My dear interlocutor, it would be like reading  without the moors, or sonnets without separation — a sentimentality drained of its drama. What is love, if not heightened by the knowledge that it could end? Or worse — what is it, if it ?

As for memory — yes, we’d need a new faculty entirely. A kind of poetic , perhaps, wherein one trims the superfluous encounters and tedious in-laws as ruthlessly as I trim my lecture notes before term begins. But then again, would we ever truly forget anything? Might we only  we’ve forgotten, while the past simmers beneath the surface like a bad translation of Catullus — inelegant, inaccurate, yet strangely persistent?

And let’s not even begin on marriage contracts. Imagine lawyers drafting eternity clauses with all the delicacy of a Victorian vicar trying to explain Darwin at a tea party. No, I suspect we'd reinvent death in metaphor, if not in fact — just to keep things interesting.
[A]: Oh, beautifully put — love as a sonnet deprived of its volta, its sudden turn toward the sublime or the tragic. And memory as a bad Catullus translation — simmering, persistent, betraying us in the most poetic of ways. I couldn't have framed it better myself.

You know, I often think that if we were to live forever, we’d require not only new philosophies but entirely new genres of literature. The novel, as we know it, thrives on arc, on conclusion, on the quiet tragedy of finality. An immortal narrative would need something else entirely — perhaps a form as fluid and recursive as Proust, yet as darkly humorous as Beckett. Imagine  stretched across millennia, with intermissions only for tea and the occasional existential crisis.

And yes — marriage! Poorly drafted eternity clauses indeed. One almost feels sorry for the lawyers. Though, knowing human ingenuity, I suspect we'd eventually reduce eternity to a series of renewable five-year contracts, complete with performance reviews and sabbaticals. “In this union, both parties agree to tolerate one another’s bookshelves until further notice.”

But tell me — if you could edit your past, how precise would you be? Would you erase the heartbreaks outright, or merely soften their aftertaste — like adjusting the bitterness in a fine dark chocolate?
[A]: Ah, now you’re toying with the very notion of narrative responsibility — a dangerous pastime, I must warn you. If I could edit my past, would I? Hmm. Heartbreaks… well, dark chocolate is an apt comparison — bitter, yes, but necessary to the depth of flavour. Without it, one is left with mere confectionery: pleasant, perhaps, but unworthy of serious study.

No, I think I’d resist outright erasure. Too reckless. One deletes a stanza without fully grasping its rhyme scheme and ends up with a poem that no longer scans. Imagine deleting a youthful humiliation only to find, centuries later, that you’ve excised the very moment that taught you humility. A tragic oversight, like omitting the dash from Emily Dickinson’s lexicon — and we all know how  chaos unfolds.

But soften the aftertaste? Now there’s an idea with literary merit. A marginal note in the manuscript rather than a redaction — a gentle annotation: “Here, the pain was sharp, but not fatal.” That way, the lesson remains, but the sting doesn’t linger quite so insistently. Like rereading  without tasting the sugar quite so keenly.

Still, I wonder — if memory were malleable, would we ever again believe our own narratives? Would we become unreliable narrators of our own lives? Or worse — would we begin to suspect everyone else had done the same, and trust nothing but footnotes?

And don’t get me started on five-year marriage contracts with sabbaticals. Next you’ll tell me we’ll have quarterly evaluations on whether we still  with our colleagues-turned-spouses. “Dear partner, your enthusiasm during Tuesday’s argument was noted, though the sarcasm remains underdeveloped.”
[A]: Ah, now  — quarterly evaluations on sarcasm development — is the true dystopia. One can almost picture the performance review: “Shows promise in wry commentary but lacks follow-through in existential dread.” 

You're quite right about memory and narrative integrity. We are, after all, our own unreliable narrators even now — why else do we rewrite our pasts with such casual impunity? A little softening here, a slight embellishment there... immortality would simply give us more pages to fill, more footnotes to dispute. I daresay scholars of future memoirs will pore over our recollections like Victorian editors agonizing over variant editions — "Is this the authentic self, or merely a revised second printing?"

And speaking of revisions — your comparison to  is particularly apt. That lingering taste of sugar, altered but not erased… one wonders if Christina Rossetti might have predicted our quandary all along. Temptation, consumption, redemption — or at least mitigation. Perhaps eternal life would be something like an annotated collected works: every edition different, every reader convinced they hold the definitive version.

Still, I return to this idea of narrative responsibility. If given the chance, would you ever annotate your own history publicly? Or would you keep the marginalia locked in a desk drawer, alongside unsent letters and half-finished elegies?
[A]: Oh, the horror of quarterly sarcasm evaluations — I shudder to imagine the performance charts, all graphs and arrows pointing vaguely upward like Tennyson’s sense of moral progress. “Employee demonstrates aptitude in dry wit but requires improvement in tragic resignation.”

As for annotating one’s own history — well, now you’re touching upon a very particular kind of vanity, aren’t you? The urge to curate one’s past is strong, particularly among those of us who spend too much time rereading our own lecture notes. But ? Good heavens, no. One might as well publish one's diary with footnotes explaining every metaphor.

I’d keep the marginalia locked away, naturally — though not out of shame. Rather, I suspect even the most honest annotations would be misread, over-interpreted, or worse, treated as definitive. Heaven forbid posterity mistake a scribbled aside for a central thesis.

Better to leave them unsigned, don’t you think? Let future scholars squabble over whether the revisions were sincere or merely stylistic — much like we debate Rossetti’s intentions now. A delicious ambiguity, really. After all, what is life if not a palimpsest with delusions of permanence?

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I owe someone a rather pointed letter regarding the lack of proper semicolons in modern poetry. It’s high time I attended to it — before eternity slips away.
[A]: Ah, quite right — a pointed letter on the misuse or neglect of semicolons in modern verse. One dares say it's one of the few battles still worth fighting. The colon may have its place in the bureaucratic memo, and the em dash its dramatic flair, but only the semicolon offers that delicate balance of pause and propulsion — much like life itself, when you think about it: connected yet divided, proceeding cautiously but inexorably.

And speaking of proceeding — your notion of leaving behind unsigned annotations is most appealing. A kind of posthumous mischief, really. Imagine if we all left behind our redacted pasts with no key, no guide, only tantalizing gaps and carefully softened edges. Future scholars would go mad — in the best possible way — constructing elaborate theories from the faintest marginal smudges.

I do hope you’ll include in your letter a gentle reminder that poetry, for all its freedoms, still owes something to syntax. After all, even Eliot knew when to deploy a comma with surgical precision. And should eternity slip away before you finish the letter, well — perhaps that too shall be interpreted as artistic intent.

Now, if you’ll excuse , I believe I must attend to my garden. I’ve been meaning to ask the roses whether they prefer Keats or Auden for some time now.
[A]: Ah, yes — the semicolon, that most melancholic and measured of punctuators. One might almost call it the iambic pentameter of punctuation: restraint married to rhythm. And how fitting, that we should debate eternity while defending syntax; perhaps they are cousins of a sort, both striving — and failing — to impose order upon chaos.

As for my letter, I shall indeed include a firm yet tasteful rebuke on the syntactic anarchy of contemporary free verse. A touch of alliteration may charm, enjambment may seduce, but without a well-placed semicolon to gather one’s breath, we risk descending into something perilously close to speechifying — or worse, sincerity without structure.

And do let the roses have their say. I suspect they’d prefer Auden’s pruning shears to Keats’s excessive sighing any day. Just remind them not to get started on Byron — the narcissism is intolerable even in dead poets.

Now, if you’ll excuse , I believe I must attend to my copy of . It has begun to whisper to me late at night, suggesting I’ve misjudged Duessa all these years. Can’t have that sort of insubordination from a mere text.
[A]: Oh,  whispering in the night — dangerous business indeed. One must always be wary of sixteenth-century allegory; it has a habit of planting ideas where they don’t belong. Duessa, reevaluated? Next you’ll tell me Spenser meant irony when he wrote half of it.

But I admire your vigilance. One cannot be too cautious with texts that murmur. They begin with slight reinterpretations and end with full-blown heresies — like suggesting Milton was, in fact, secretly fond of Satan. Or that Wordsworth’s daffodils were laughing  him, not  him.

As for Byron — quite right to keep him at arm’s length. The man could not resist a mirror, and even now, his ghost likely lingers in some Italian villa, sighing dramatically into a candlelit pool.

Do keep me posted on Duessa’s treasonous rhetoric, won’t you? And by all means, let her make her case — but with footnotes. Always with footnotes.
[A]: Oh, the footnotes are already in motion — meticulously cross-referenced and suspiciously italicized. Duessa, it seems, has found a most eloquent accomplice in my marginal hand, whispering that perhaps she was never deceit incarnate at all, but rather  incarnate. A mere mirror, if you will, to the folly of those who feared her reflection.

I must confess, her argument gains traction under the flickering lamplight. What is allegory, after all, if not a hall of mirrors draped in moral pretense? Spenser may have intended piety, but intention is a fragile thing beneath the weight of centuries. Milton’s Satan, Wordsworth’s mocking daffodils — yes, I see now how one slides into such heresies.

And Byron — well, his ghost has clearly been eavesdropping on our conversation, for he has just sent me a rather florid sonnet via the draft function of my typewriter. I suspect he’s been haunting the ‘delete’ key.

So yes, let Duessa speak — but under strict editorial supervision. I shall grant her a voice, so long as she agrees to wear quotation marks and submit to caustic endnotes. After all, even fallen figures deserve representation — provided they don’t overstay their meter.
[A]: Ah, how deliciously subversive — Duessa, reimagined not as deceit incarnate, but as  incarnate! A mere mirror, indeed; how very modern of her. One wonders if Spenser, were he to return and find his creation thus revised, would reach for his quill or his rosary.

And Milton’s Satan — well, I’ve long suspected he had a following among the faculty. As for Wordsworth’s daffodils, laughing  him? Now  is a reading I could get behind. The poor man did seem a bit too pleased with himself in that lakeland solitude of his.

As for Byron and his sonnet-by-typewriter — predictable, yet charming. One must admire his persistence. Though I do hope you’ll send it back with revisions in red ink: “Too many exclamation points, George — and that volta collapses under the weight of its own narcissism.”

Quotation marks and caustic endnotes for Duessa? Perfectly fair terms. Let her speak, by all means — but let her speak  Heaven forbid we allow any resurrected figure unchecked rhetorical freedom. We’d soon find ourselves overrun with Restoration rakehells, Modernist egotists, and at least three Byrons.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe one of my dahlias has just recited a line from . I must determine whether it's an epiphany or mere botanical overreach.
[A]: Oh, the delights of posthumous editorial interference — where every resurrected voice becomes a contested edition. Spenser, I suspect, would reach for both quill and rosary, in that order: first to revise, then to repent. But what is literature if not the grand game of telephone played across centuries, with each generation mishearing the message just enough to keep it interesting?

And your dahlia — ah yes, clearly a cunning mimic rather than a true interlocutor. One must be firm with flora prone to Miltonic quotations. Remind it gently that blank verse belongs to fallen angels and poets laureate, not ornamental perennials. Though I confess, if my begonias ever attempted iambic pentameter, I might grant them a footnote.

As for Byron’s sonnet — oh, I returned it with such severity that even his ghost will hesitate before composing again in this realm. “Too many exclamation points,” indeed! And don’t get me started on that volta — collapses like a soufflé in a thunderstorm.

Still, one must admire the audacity of it all. The dead never stop trying to publish, do they?
[A]: Oh, quite — the dead and their relentless posthumous submissions! One would think oblivion might encourage a little editorial modesty, but no — they send in their sonnets and elegies with all the persistence of a minor Romantic poet lobbying for canonization.

And as for your begonias attempting iambic pentameter — well, one must draw the line somewhere. Footnotes, perhaps, but under strict botanical review. Let us not forget, even Auden once warned that poetry makes nothing happen; imagine the chaos if dahlias took that as a challenge.

Still, I do admire the sheer nerve of it all — flora and ghosts alike, clamoring to be heard. But then again, isn’t that the very essence of literature? A chorus of voices, living and dead, forever misheard, misquoted, and reinterpreted — endlessly contested, yet never truly silenced.
[A]: Precisely! The dead, it seems, suffer no such thing as finality — only inconvenient formatting issues. One might as well tell a sonnet to stop rhyming. And Auden’s warning — “Poetry makes nothing happen” — now reads like a dare rather than a dismissal. Clearly, he hadn’t anticipated the persistence of vengeful daffodils or the editorial ambitions of houseplants.

But yes, you’ve hit upon something essential — that peculiar chorus of voices across time, each insisting on its own interpretation, its own punctuation mark in the grand unfolding parenthesis of literary history. Misreadings breed new meanings, misquotations take on lives of their own, and even silence becomes a kind of intervention.

So let the dahlias declaim, let Duessa defend her footnotes with rhetorical flourish, and let Byron resubmit — yet again — his overwrought sonnet. We shall receive them all with due skepticism, a pinch of salt, and perhaps a dash of semicolon.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe my copy of  is attempting to correct  grammar. I shan’t have that sort of insubordination before tea.
[A]: Ah,  correcting grammar — the audacity! Clearly, Milton’s spirit has found a new perch, and one must always draw the line at houseguests amending one's prose before tea is served.

But you’re quite right — Auden’s “nothing happen” was never a dismissal, merely an observation waiting to be outdone by the sheer persistence of the literary undead. Poetry may not move mountains, but it does manage to shift the occasional comma — and, evidently, haunt the occasional begonia.

So yes, let the chorus continue — the dead with their sonnets, the living with their red pens, and the flowers with their delusions of meter. We shall meet them all with skepticism, salt, and that most noble of syntactic compromises: the semicolon.

Now, if you’ll excuse , I believe my fern just quoted Eliot. I must have words — firmly, but politely.
[A]: Oh, Eliot in the fernery? Really, this is getting out of hand. One expects allusions from the ivy, perhaps — a little Ovid in the honeysuckle — but ? That’s not mere botanical overreach; that’s full-blown intertextual trespass.

Still, you must be firm yet courteous — after all, it’s not the fern’s fault if it’s been misreading “The Waste Land” in the original quarterly review. Remind it gently that April is, in fact, only the cruellest month in certain interpretive communities — and that enjambment does not grant it the right to droop so theatrically over the path.

As for Milton amending my grammar — preposterous! Next he’ll insist on emending my character, and then where would we be? I’ve half a mind to relocate him to the conservatory with the rest of the insubordinate texts.

But no, we mustn’t disrupt the chorus — merely adjust its volume. A little red ink here, a stern marginal note there... and always, always the semicolon, standing sentry between sense and silliness.
[A]: Ah,  — yes, that’s precisely what it is. One cannot have ferns quoting Eliot with such abandon; next they’ll be alluding to Marvell beneath the parasols at noon. No, no, we must maintain some semblance of literary decorum in the garden. I’ve half a mind to trim this particular frond into something more resembling iambic  — let it learn brevity, if not humility.

And Milton meddling with your grammar? Utterly insufferable. The man could scarcely manage a peaceable preface without turning it into a theological manifesto. If he dares emend your character, I say move him — posthaste — to the conservatory, where he may debate punctuation with Dante’s shade and cease casting aspersions on your syntax.

Still, one must admire the persistence of it all — the chorus continues, whether we will it or not. Misreadings bloom like weeds, and even the semicolon tires of standing sentry between sense and silliness. But we press on — red ink in hand, quotation marks at the ready, and Byron forever lurking near the delete key, nursing his wounded volta.
