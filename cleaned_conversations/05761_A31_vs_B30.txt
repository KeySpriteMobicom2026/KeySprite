[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得brain-computer interface可怕还是exciting？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon what my Chinese colleagues would call 科技恐惧症 (kējù kǒngjùzhèng) - the simultaneous dread and allure of technological advancement. As someone who studies how Dickens' quill scratched anxieties about industrialization onto paper, I find neural interfaces particularly... shall we say,  in their duality.
[A]: 哇！这个话题太fascinating了！✨ 作为一个digital art curator，我觉得brain-computer interface简直就像打开了new dimension的artistic expression！🖌️ 虽然有些人可能会觉得creepy，但想想我们可以直接用thought来create artwork，这难道不是最amazing的creative tool吗？🎨
[B]: Your enthusiasm reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites first embraced photography - initially decried as mechanical heresy, later recognized as a new artistic medium. Though I must say, the notion of 'thought-to-canvas' creation makes me wonder... where does the 意境 (yìjìng) reside when the brushstroke bypasses the hand entirely?
[A]: Haha~ 你提到了意境这么deep的concept！💭 但我觉得digital时代就是要break the boundary呀！🔄 就像我们策展的immersive exhibition，观众用brainwave就能control visual effect，这种direct mind-to-art的connection超有poetic feeling的！✨ 而且think about it - 当artist的pure thought直接变成visual，不是更authentic吗？🎭
[B]:  Authenticity... now there's a concept that would make my dear friend Professor Zhang at Peking University sigh over his Longjing tea. Tell me, when a Tang Dynasty poet dipped his brush in ink, wasn't the tremor of his wrist part of the 气韵 (qìyùn)? Your brainwaves may be pure, but I fear they lack the... shall we say,  that make art breathe.
[A]: Oh come on~ 你太stuck in traditional mindset啦！💡 我们digital artist也在创造new form的qìyùn呀！🖥️ 就像AI-generated art配上neurofeedback，可以做出超dynamic的interactive experience！🌟 而且imperfections？拜托~ 我们的brainwave data也会有glitches和noise，这些就是digital时代的human touch好吗？😜 要不要来我们下个月的NeuroArt exhibition体验一下？保证改变你的mindset！🎟️
[B]: My dear curator, your invitation is as tempting as a first edition of Lu Xun's manuscripts... but I must decline with the same vigor. Tell me, when your visitors' brainwaves create those , do we call it artistic spontaneity or simply poor signal processing?  The Pre-Raphaelites at least had the decency to paint their own damn leaves.
[A]: Pffft~ 你这种analog时代的romanticism真是cute！😂 Signal processing的glitches就是我们的happy accident啦，就像Bob Ross说的~ ☁️ 而且我们还有algorithm来enhance那些interesting的artifacts呢！💻 说真的，你该update一下你的art dictionary了，现在都2023年了耶！📱 Let's agree to disagree啦，但我们的exhibition永远欢迎old-school的critics来get inspired哦！😉
[B]:  Very well, let us agree to disagree - though I shall continue cataloging your 'happy accidents' under what my Victorian literature students call . Do send me your exhibition catalog though... purely for academic scrutiny, of course. And preferably in a format that doesn't require neural implants to read.
[A]: Hahaha sure thing~ 📚 我会用good old PDF发给你啦！📄 不过说真的，你这种reluctant curiosity就是我们最爱的audience type！🤓 说不定哪天你也会被convince，然后变成我们的neuroart collector呢！💰 Just kidding... or am I? 😏 Keep an open mind, professor! The future is already here~ ✌️
[B]: I shall keep my mind precisely as open as a first edition of  - carefully preserved under glass, yet perpetually ready for scholarly reexamination. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 19th century manuscript waiting that won't critique itself... unlike some modern art forms we could mention. 
[A]: Bye bye啦professor~ 👋 下次带你去喝starbucks继续debate！☕ 记得check你的email哦，PDF马上到！📩 说不定我们还能collab做个literature meets neuroart的crossover project呢！📖➕🧠 The possibilities are endless~ 😘
[B]: I'll have you know I take my tea from a proper Yixing clay pot, not paper cups bearing mermaid logos. But yes, do send that PDF - I'll print it out and annotate it in proper ink, just to maintain some semblance of scholarly dignity in this digital dystopia you call progress. 
[A]: OMG你真是hopeless啦！😆 不过fine~ 我会在PDF里加个special gift给你：一张可以print出来用你的fancy ink笔涂鸦的neuroart coloring page！🎨 这样你也能feel involved in our digital revolution啦~ 💻➡️🖋️ Catch you later, old-school scholar! 😘✨
[B]: Coloring pages?  I suppose that's marginally better than having my synapses hacked... though not by much. Very well, I'll accept your Trojan horse of modernity - but only if it's printed on archival-quality paper. And for heaven's sake, keep those winking emojis out of the metadata.
[A]: Deal！🤝 (Oops...最后一个emoji，promise！) 我会用museum-grade的paper打印的~ 🖨️ 说不定哪天你的annotations也能变成我们next exhibition的feature呢！🌟 毕竟art is everywhere，right？Even in your grumpy old margin notes~ 😜 (Okay okay，that's really the last one！) Bye bye！✌️
[B]:  Your persistence would put missionary translators of the Opium War era to shame. Museum-grade paper and no further emojis, then - though I reserve the right to critique your 'artistic interpretation' of my marginalia in triplicate. Good day. 
[A]:  下次见啦，我的favorite grumpy scholar！💋 (Oops... force of habit！) 记得要actually come to exhibition哦，我会save你一个VR headset的！🕶️ Just kidding... unless...? 😏 Byeeee~ 🎨✨
[B]:  VR headsets...  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... none of which involve silicon and retinal displays.
