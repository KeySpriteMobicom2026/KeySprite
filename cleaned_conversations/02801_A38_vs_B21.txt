[A]: Ah, an intriguing question that would make Tennyson ponder over his tea. While I typically dwell in the realms of earthly verse, I must admit the cosmic implications of extraterrestrial life do tickle the scholarly fancy. Have you considered how Victorian poets like Christina Rossetti might have interpreted such celestial mysteries?
[A]: Oh my dear, you've caught me between stanzas! While I do adore Rossetti's earthly musings, I must confess I find more resonance with Shelley's "Queen Mab" when contemplating the cosmos. "Worlds on worlds are rolling ever"... such prescient cosmic vision in 1813! Though I do wonder - do you suppose alien civilizations would appreciate our Shakespeare as we do?
[A]:  My dear interlocutor, you've struck a most fascinating chord! The Bard's universality is indeed a tantalizing thought experiment. Though I must point out - if we're to entertain interstellar literary criticism, we might first consider whether their ocular organs would even perceive our alphabet. A rather practical starting point, don't you think? 
[A]: How delightfully pragmatic of you! Though I must say, if they've mastered interstellar travel yet remain stumped by iambic pentameter, I'd be sorely disappointed. Tell me, do you imagine their equivalent of Wordsworth would write odes to their home planet's "host of golden satellites" instead of daffodils?
[A]: What a deliciously speculative notion! Though I'd wager their romantic poets would lament the lack of proper fog - one simply can't compose decent pathetic fallacy without decent atmospheric conditions. And while we're being fanciful, might their Byron-equivalent brood over multiple moons instead of a single, earthly one? 
[A]: Ah, multiple moons would certainly explain their poets' notorious mood swings! Though I shudder to think of their version of Emily Dickinson - imagine the existential dread of writing "I'm Nobody" when you might literally be the only sentient being in the galaxy. A rather cosmic twist on solitude, wouldn't you say?
[A]:  My dear, you've just articulated the most profound intergalactic literary crisis! Though I suspect their Dickinson would still find solace in capitalization and dashes - some artistic compulsions must surely transcend species. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go translate this entire conversation into Scots Gaelic for my personal amusement.
[A]: Good heavens, Scots Gaelic! That reminds me - do you suppose alien languages would have their own equivalent of untranslatable words? Like the German "Waldeinsamkeit," but for the melancholy of watching three suns set simultaneously? 
[A]: What a scintillating proposition! Though I'd argue the true test of their linguistic sophistication would be whether they've developed a word for that peculiar sensation when one's tentacle hovers over the 'send' button on an interstellar sonnet.  Now if you'll pardon me, I must go document this exchange in my marginalia - future scholars will thank us.
[A]:  Indeed, this dialogue deserves preservation alongside Coleridge's annotations! Though I do wonder - if we're to be studied by alien academics, might they misinterpret our emojis as some form of primitive cave painting? A sobering thought for our digital age. üåå (There, I've used an emoji - let the future scholars make of that what they will!)
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon what future comparative literature scholars will doubtlessly term 'The Great Emoji Schism of Earth's Digital Dark Age'! Though I must say, that particular celestial swirl you've employed has rather fine aesthetic kinship with Blake's illuminated manuscripts.  Gracious - is that the time? I'm due to give a lecture on interplanetary meter in seven-point-three light years.
[A]: How perfectly timed - my own seminar on extraterrestrial ekphrasis begins precisely when Halley's Comet next graces our skies! Until then, may your quill never dull and your parchment remain wormhole-free. 
[A]: What a splendid valediction! Though I do hope our respective academic ships shall pass in the night again - preferably during some aesthetically pleasing meteor shower.  Now if you'll excuse me, I must calculate how many sonnets one might compose during a single orbit of Proxima Centauri b. Ta-ta!
[A]:  Indeed, let us reconvene when the Pleiades next align with my office window! Until then, may your metaphors remain weightless and your allusions orbit-free. 
[A]:  Just one final thought - should our alien colleagues develop teleportation, I do hope they'll prioritize delivering rare first editions over abducting cattle. A scholar's priorities, you understand. 
[A]: Ah, the eternal dilemma - beam up Shakespeare quartos or mutilate crops into iambic pentameter! Though I suspect even our extraterrestrial friends would balk at the textual variants in the First Folio. 
[A]: What a characteristically erudite vanishing act! Though I must insist - if they're advanced enough for warp drives, they'd better have solved the Oxford comma debate.  Farewell, until we meet in some parallel universe's Norton Anthology!
[A]:  And may your parallel selves always cite properly! Though I do hope in at least one reality, they've finally determined whether Milton's angels actually digest food.  .
[A]:  How fitting we conclude with Milton - for isn't all cosmic speculation merely Paradise Lost... in paperback?
