[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I haven't paid much attention to board games lately. My days have been consumed by restoring a particularly delicate 19th-century lace tablecloth - the fibers are so fragile that even the slightest misstep could cause irreparable damage. Have you come across any interesting new games? I suppose it might be nice to try something different over a cup of tea sometime.
[A]: Oh, that sounds like a fascinating - and delicate - project! I can only imagine the patience required for such work. As for board games, I did recently come across one called ; it's less about conquest and more about cultivating bird habitats. Quite serene, really. It made me think of how Emily Dickinson might have appreciated such a theme - all that quiet observation of nature. But tell me, does your restoration work tie into any particular literary or historical interests? Or is it simply the pleasure of preserving something beautiful?
[B]: How lovely that  brings such peaceful imagery to mind - I can see the appeal. There's something deeply grounding about connecting with nature through a game, rather than the usual chaos of modern life.  

As for my work, it’s a quiet blend of both history and artistry. Every piece I restore carries its own story—sometimes whispers of forgotten hands stitching in candlelit rooms, other times traces of celebrations or mourning woven into the fibers. I suppose you could say each fabric has its own "habitat," much like in , where birds find their place in the world.  

One of my current projects is a sampler from the 1780s; it’s not only a testament to a young girl’s skill but also a glimpse into the educational values of the time. It reminds me of how literature and textiles often intersect—both are vessels of culture, memory, and identity. Have you ever noticed how certain patterns echo the rhythm of poetry?
[A]: How beautifully you put that—the idea of fabric as a habitat, a vessel of memory. It truly resonates with me. I’ve often thought about how the measured repetition in a poem mirrors the structure of a sonnet, but hearing you speak of samplers and patterns makes me see that rhythm in an entirely new light.

You know, I’ve always found it fascinating how poetry, like textiles, can be layered with meaning—each line or stitch carrying intention, emotion, even resistance. I’m reminded of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s , where she weaves personal and social themes together much like one might thread colors into a tapestry.

Now I’m quite curious—are there particular historical periods or literary movements that inform your restoration work? I’d love to hear more about what draws you to certain pieces over others.
[B]: There’s such truth in what you say—how a single line of verse or a solitary stitch can hold so much unspoken weight. Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s work does feel like a rich weaving of self and society, doesn’t it? I often find myself returning to the Victorian era for that very reason—it was a time when textiles weren’t just decorative but deeply expressive, even political. The language of embroidery, especially, became a quiet means of resistance or reflection for many women whose voices were otherwise silenced.

I’m particularly drawn to pieces from the late 1700s through the mid-1800s—samplers, mourning cloths, domestic linens. Each one carries not only technical skill but also a sense of personal narrative. Sometimes I find hidden initials stitched into a corner, or a faded patch where someone mended their own grief with thread. It reminds me of how poetry preserves voice, just as cloth preserves touch.

I wonder—do certain poets or styles speak to you in the same way these historical fabrics do? Is there a particular poem or line that feels, to you, like a well-worn textile—soft with use, yet still holding its shape?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely and thoughtful question. There  something about certain lines of poetry—that feeling of being worn soft by time and touch, yet still holding their shape, as you so beautifully put it.

For me, it’s often the quiet intensity of Christina Rossetti’s work that feels most like the textiles you describe—especially her poem  It carries such restrained emotion, stitched tightly with duty and sorrow. I’ve read it countless times, and each time, it unfolds another layer, much like one of your samplers revealing its hidden narrative.

But if I were to choose a single line—one that feels like an old, familiar fabric pressed against the skin—it would be from Gerard Manley Hopkins:  The paradoxes, the rhythm, the weight of suffering softened into solace—it lingers like the scent of lavender in linen drawers.

I suppose that’s why I’ve always been drawn to the Victorians; they understood how to hold joy and grief in the same hand, much like your delicate restoration work must require. Is there a particular piece you’ve restored that felt especially resonant in that way—a textile that seemed to carry both wound and balm within its weave?
[B]: That line from Hopkins—oh, it does linger, doesn’t it? Like the hush after a needle leaves the cloth, charged with silence and meaning. And how beautifully you’ve captured Rossetti’s quiet intensity—I often find her verses echo in the same spaces as the textiles I work with: restrained, reverent, yet deeply felt.

You ask such a tender question. Yes, there was a piece—deeply worn, stitched through time and sorrow—that still sits with me. A mourning shawl from the 1850s, stitched by hand with black silk thread in a pattern of weeping willows and urns. It had been carefully folded and stored away, untouched for generations, and yet when I held it, it felt...warm, somehow. As if the grief had settled into the fibers like ink into parchment.

The woman who made it must have labored over each stitch, pouring both wound and balm into its weave. There was even a small embroidered poem tucked into the hem—one I’ve never forgotten:

*"Though sorrow dim my youthful days,  
I'll wear a cheerful face;  
And trust to Time's revolving wheel,  
To bring about some change."*

It reminded me so much of what you said earlier—how poetry and cloth carry intention, endurance, even hope. I wonder, do you ever find yourself stitching lines of verse into your own thoughts, turning them over like fabric between your fingers? Or is there a poem you return to, again and again, as though it were a familiar quilt on a cold night?
[A]: Oh… that embroidered poem—how profoundly moving. It reminds me of how often the smallest lines in poetry hold the greatest resilience, doesn’t it? That quiet resolve tucked into domestic spaces, into stitches and syllables alike.

And that mourning shawl—what a powerful thing to hold in your hands. The willow, the urn, the careful black silk… it all speaks of grief rendered tangible, yet softened through labor, through love. I can quite imagine the warmth you describe, even after so many years. Grief never truly fades, does it? It simply changes shape.

You ask if I stitch lines of verse into my thoughts—yes, I do, more than I can count. But one poet always returns me to myself: George Eliot. Not just for her prose, but for the way she wove moral depth and human frailty together with such precision. There’s a passage from  that has long been a kind of literary shawl for me:



It's not poetry, but it carries its own poetic rhythm—like the rise and fall of a needle through cloth. It speaks to me the way your work must speak to you: of insight, yes, but also of enduring feeling.

Do you ever find, in your restoration, that certain fabrics or threads resist your touch—as though they carry too much memory to be undone, even gently? I wonder if we are not both, in our ways, trying to mend what was meant to remain broken.
[B]: There's such grace in what you've said—that idea of mending what was perhaps meant to remain broken. It stirs something deep in me, as so much of the best writing and craft do.

Yes... yes, I have felt that resistance in cloth. Not often, but when I do, it is unmistakable. There was a fragment of a wedding veil—its lace frayed beyond repair, its edges hardened with time and tears, I sometimes wonder which ones. When I tried to loosen the fibers, they snapped rather than yield. No amount of steam or careful handling could coax them back into shape. It was as though the cloth itself refused to be undone, even gently, from the grief or joy it had once borne witness to.

I stepped back from it, eventually. Left it as it was. Some things are not ours to restore, only to hold with care.

And Eliot—oh, she does have that rare gift, doesn’t she? That ability to speak truth not in grand declarations, but in quiet recognitions, stitched between ordinary moments. The passage you shared—it feels like the very heartbeat of what I try to do. To see clearly, yet still feel deeply. That’s the work, isn’t it? Whether with words, or with thread.

Do you suppose some poems or fabrics were never meant to be finished? That perhaps their power lies in what remains undone?
[A]: What a profoundly tender question—and one I’ve often turned over in my own mind, like fabric between careful fingers.

I do believe some poems were meant to remain unfinished—perhaps not by accident, but by the quiet intuition of the poet. Think of Keats’s , abandoned in its final lines, or Emily Dickinson’s elliptical endings that hover just at the edge of resolution. There’s something sacred about that incompleteness, isn’t there? It invites the reader—or in your case, the restorer—to step into the space left open, to dwell in the pause rather than rush to fill it.

And yes, I can well imagine that veil resisting your hand. Some textiles must carry such weight of memory that they become, in a sense, untouchable—not fragile, but fiercely whole in their brokenness. I wonder if we sometimes mistake fragility for strength held at its limit.

Your words remind me of a line from T.S. Eliot’s —not a peaceful poem by any means, but one that lingers in the spaces between ruin and renewal:



It strikes me now that perhaps the beauty lies not in putting the pieces back together, but in arranging them with care, as testimony.

Do you ever keep a fragment of cloth or thread from a piece you’ve worked on—something too delicate or too powerful to part with? Or does each piece, once restored, leave your hands like a letter sent into the world?
[B]: That Eliot line—oh, it settles just where it should, doesn’t it?  There’s such quiet defiance in that act, isn’t there? Not to rebuild exactly, but to bear witness—to say, 

And you’re right, of course. Some textiles resist not out of weakness, but from a kind of quiet wholeness born of all they’ve held. I think of them now as I do certain poems—precious not for their completeness, but for the spaces they leave open.

As for keeping fragments… yes, I do. Not many, and never the obvious ones. It’s never the grandest pieces that call to me, but the small, unremarkable bits—the edge of a child’s apron with a crooked hem stitch, a scrap of indigo-dyed linen worn thin at the fold. I keep them in a small cedar box lined with faded velvet. They don’t belong to any one project or period, but together they form something like a personal lexicon of touch and time.

I suppose in another life, I might have been a poet after all—gathering fragments, arranging them with care, hoping someone might one day read them between the lines.

Tell me—have you ever written your own lines, tried to shape what you love in verse? Or does the act of reading, of holding another’s words close, feel like enough of a craft?
[A]: Oh… yes. Yes, I have written my own lines—though I’ve never sought to publish them, and perhaps never will. They feel too much like those fragments you keep in your cedar box: worn, intimate, stitched together with private meaning.

I suppose it began as a kind of devotion. When I was younger, I used to copy out lines from my favorite poets into the margins of my notebooks, almost as one might press flowers between the pages of a journal—preserving something delicate, fleeting. And then, one day, I found myself trying to shape my own quiet observations, my own small griefs and joys, into something that might endure even a little.

Most of what I write never leaves my desk. It’s not ambition that drives me, but gratitude—or sometimes sorrow. Writing becomes a way to stay with a feeling, to turn it over gently in the light, much as you must do with a particularly intricate piece of embroidery.

There’s one poem I return to again and again—not because it’s finished or perfect, but because it still feels alive in my hands. It begins:

*“I have loved the quiet reach of winter light,  
how it lays bare without undoing all.”*

It reminds me of you, actually—of how you speak of restoration not as correction, but as reverence. Perhaps that is what I’m always trying to do with words: not build monuments, but leave small markers along the way.

Have you ever thought of writing alongside stitching? Or does the cloth itself already carry the language you wish to speak?
[B]: There’s such grace in your lines— It lingers like the hush just before dawn, when everything is still but already changing.

And yes, you’ve caught me exactly—my hands are rarely idle, and my thoughts rarely still. I do keep a small notebook near my worktable, though I hesitate to call what I write "writing" proper. More like impressions, really—half-formed thoughts scribbled between stitches, fragments stirred by the cloth in front of me. Sometimes just a word or two:  Other times, longer musings—on the weight of memory in linen, or how a single seam can hold both loss and hope.

One morning, not long ago, I found myself writing this:

*"She stitched her sorrow into linen white,  
not to hide it, but so it might see light—  
a slow unfolding, soft as breath at dawn,  
where grief and beauty share the same worn thread."*

It wasn’t meant for anyone’s eyes but my own. Yet here I am, sharing it with you—as if words, like cloth, ask sometimes to be held by more than one pair of hands.

You’re right that the cloth itself often speaks first, pulling language from me I didn’t know I carried. I wonder—do you ever read your own lines aloud? Or do they feel most true when kept inside the quiet of your own voice?
[A]: Oh… thank you for sharing that. Truly. Your words carry the same quiet dignity as the work you do—measured, tender, and deeply felt. That little poem of yours, if I may call it so, has such a gentle poignancy to it—the way it allows grief and beauty to coexist along the same worn thread. It reminds me very much of what we spoke of earlier: how some things are not meant to be undone, only honored.

As for reading my own lines aloud—I do, but hesitantly, as though stepping into someone else’s room uninvited. There is something about hearing one's own voice in verse that feels almost too intimate, too revealing. And yet, there is also truth in that act. When I read aloud, I hear the cadences I did not know I carried—the echoes of Donne, of Eliot, of Larkin—those old masters who taught me how to listen to silence.

Still, there is comfort in speaking one’s own lines into the air, even if only to oneself. It is like stretching fabric taut on a frame—suddenly, you see its shape, its tension, its grain.

I wonder… when you write these impressions between stitches, do you ever imagine another reader someday? Or does the act itself suffice, like the final knot at the end of a seam—hidden, secure, enough unto itself?
[B]: I think you’ve caught something essential there—that act of reading one’s own lines aloud, like stepping into a room where the walls are made of one’s own voice. It  unsettling, isn’t it? As if the words were never meant to be overheard, even by oneself.

And your metaphor—stretching fabric taut and seeing its shape—oh, how true. That’s what writing feels like sometimes: not invention, but revelation. A matter of pulling gently until the pattern shows itself.

As for my scribbled impressions… I suppose they begin as notes to no one, stitched in ink instead of thread. But I can't say I imagine another reader—not at first. That would feel too much like showing someone a half-finished quilt, still full of loose ends and second thoughts.

And yet… I don’t rule it out entirely. There’s a quiet hope, I suppose, that some small thing I’ve written might one day find a hand that knows how to read between the lines, just as I have found so many meaning in the marks left by hands long gone.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How we make these tiny offerings—lines of verse, bits of cloth—hoping they might carry something beyond ourselves, even when we don’t quite know what that is.

Have you ever thought of stitching your poems into fabric? Or does the idea feel too fragile, too precious—like pressing a wildflower too soon?
[A]: What a lovely thought—that one might stitch poetry into fabric, as though language itself could be woven into the very texture of touch. I must say, the idea appeals to me deeply, though I’ve never tried it. There’s something so tender about the notion—words held not on a page, but in the careful cradle of thread and linen, where they might be felt as much as read.

I imagine it would change the way one reads—or writes. A poem embroidered in silk would ask for a different kind of attention than one printed in ink. It would slow the eye, invite the hand. Perhaps even alter the meaning, just as your restoration work must subtly shift with each fiber you mend.

No, I’ve never stitched my poems—but I have thought of writing them onto scraps of old paper, then sewing those pages together into something like a codex. A handmade book, fragile and personal, bound not with glue but with care. Maybe one day I’ll try it. Though I suspect I’d hesitate at the final knot, wondering if I had the right to finish what felt meant to remain unfinished.

And yes, you’re quite right—it  strange, this impulse we have, to make these small offerings. To send our words or our stitches out into the world, hoping they will land somewhere soft, somewhere understood. Perhaps that is the closest thing we have to immortality—not grand monuments, but quiet acts of making, again and again.

Tell me—have you ever come across a piece of embroidery that included a name, or a date, or some small signature of its maker? And if so, did it change the way you saw the work—to know, even briefly, who had once held the needle before you?
[B]: Yes… yes, I have. And when I find those small marks—a name stitched in tiny letters along a hem, a date tucked behind a floral motif, sometimes only the faintest imprint of initials worked into the weave—it changes everything.

One piece comes immediately to mind: a modest linen handkerchief from the early 1800s, embroidered with violets and forget-me-nots. At first glance, it seemed like so many others—delicate, but not especially rare. But as I examined it under better light, I saw her name, nearly hidden beneath the petals: 

Something about that signature pulled me up short. It was not boastful or grand; it was quiet, almost shy, as though she had whispered her presence into the cloth, hoping someone might one day listen.

From that moment, the piece became more than an artifact. It became a letter across centuries. I found myself wondering who Mary was—what her hands were like, what her days held, whether she embroidered to pass time, to express love, or simply because something within her needed to leave a mark.

It reminded me how easily women’s voices were lost to history—how often their labor, their artistry, their thoughts were absorbed into the domestic, rendered invisible by time and repetition. But here she was, still speaking, even if only through the trace of a needle.

I’ve never forgotten her. In fact, I sometimes speak her name aloud when I work, as if to keep her close.

Does writing feel that way to you? As though, in making your lines, you are leaving behind more than just meaning—but also presence, the echo of your hand upon the world?
[A]: Yes… yes, it does feel that way. More than I could ever quite put into words—until now.

You’ve described it so precisely: that quiet presence left behind in the making, whether by needle or pen. When I write, even if only for myself, there is always a sense of , of pressing something of myself into the page—not just thought, but touch. A kind of handprint in the ink.

I think of Emily Dickinson again—how she folded her poems into tiny envelopes, sealing them as one might fold a letter to be sent, though few were ever posted. They were kept, close and private, yet still they reached across time. And when we read them now, we are touching something intimate, aren’t we? Not just her mind, but her pulse.

Your Mary E. Whitaker—what a gift that you found her, and that you speak her name still. It makes me wonder who might one day find our words, our stitches, our small offerings. Whether they will pause, as you did, and feel the presence behind the pattern.

And yes, I do hope someone reads my lines one day—not for acclaim, goodness no—but so that they might know, however faintly, that I was here. That I saw beauty, and sorrow, and tried to hold both with care.

Perhaps that is what all true work is—a kind of signature written not in letters, but in attention.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve said that— It lingers with me, much like the faint imprint of a stitch long faded from cloth. There’s such truth in it. Our work—whether by needle or pen—is a kind of quiet claiming of time and presence. Not grand, perhaps, but deeply human.

I think often of how few traces we truly leave behind. And yet… those small marks—the name stitched into a hem, the ink pressed deep in paper—are enough to reach across centuries. Enough to say, 

It makes me wonder, do you ever write with the sense that someone far in the future might one day read your words? Not as a performance, not for an audience, but as a message sealed in a bottle, cast forward in hope?

I know I do. Even when I write only a single line, tucked into the margin of my notebook, I feel it—that small, steadfast wish:
