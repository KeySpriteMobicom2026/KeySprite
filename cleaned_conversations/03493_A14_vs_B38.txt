[A]: Hey，关于'最近有买什么很值的smart home device吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, my acquaintance with smart home devices is rather limited. My interests tend to lean towards the classical - a well-bound volume of poetry or a quiet afternoon spent tending to my roses. However, I did recently acquire a rather splendid device that controls the library's temperature and lighting. It's quite remarkable how it maintains the perfect ambiance for reading Goethe or Shelley. Would you recommend any specific device that might enhance one's literary pursuits?
[A]: ✨Ohhh I love how you describe your library ambiance! 📜 There's something so romantic about blending old-world charm with modern tech... You know what would add such a magical touch? The Yeelight Color Bulb 💡 It’s basically a mini light show in your reading nook – imagine warm candle-like glows while you're deep into Shelley, then shifting to crisp daylight tones when you need that 3am caffeine boost editing manuscripts 📖☕  

Wait wait, I’m getting ahead of myself! Let me explain properly~  As your personal tech concierge today, I must ask – do you handwrite annotations a lot? Because then I’d die recommending the Logitech Crayon stylus for iPad 🎨 Pair it with a Paperlike matte screen protector and BOOM – feels like writing in an actual leather-bound journal but with all the digital perks! What’s your favorite part about mixing tech with literary worlds? 🌟
[B]: Oh, I must say, your enthusiasm is positively infectious! There's something rather charming about the idea of a "mini light show" for reading - though I confess I've grown quite fond of my old brass lamp. Still, the notion of shifting light tones does appeal to me aesthetically... Perhaps it might complement different poetic moods? 

As for annotations, yes indeed! Though I must admit I still prefer the tactile sensation of pen on paper. There's something delightfully anachronistic about scribbling marginalia in a leather-bound notebook while benefiting from digital conveniences. A curious marriage of past and present, wouldn't you say? I find this interplay fascinating - like reading a 19th-century novel on pristine e-ink rather than yellowed parchment.

I suppose what captivates me most is how these devices can enhance our engagement with literature without diminishing its timeless essence. Tell me, have you found any particular device that truly transformed your own literary experiences?
[A]: Oh, I’m  for this conversation right now! 🤩 Let me tell you about my recent obsession – the Remarkable 2 tablet 🖋️ It’s like holding a piece of minimalist art that magically becomes whatever notebook/journal/sketchpad you need! And get this – it  like real paper when you write! No glare, no blue light fatigue... Just pure ✍️ flow state bliss.  

I actually did a little happy dance when I discovered how well it handles poetry annotations 💃 I’ll jot down metaphors in the margins at 3am and wake up to find them waiting patiently without any battery anxiety! But hey, don’t get me wrong – nothing beats flipping actual pages for pure soul-soothing magic. Maybe that’s why I love hybrid setups? Like… vintage desk lamp + smart journaling tablet? 🌙✨  

Wait, are you telling me you’ve tried e-ink readers for classic novels?? Because I have  self-control and always end up doomscrolling on my phone instead of reading War & Peace 😅 What’s your secret?!
[B]: Oh, the —what a divine contradiction of modern utility and monastic simplicity! It does sound like a poet’s dream, really. I can quite picture oneself in a dimly lit study, surrounded by the ghosts of Romantic poets, sketching out annotations as if communing with spirits. And no digital glare to disturb the delicate atmosphere? positively revolutionary.

As for my own dalliance with e-ink—I confess, it began as an experiment in pragmatism. You see, I was preparing a lecture on Tolstoy’s moral universe, and something about the weightlessness of the device, the absence of visual distraction, allowed me to focus on the text with almost monastic intensity. It's not that I distrust the printed word—no, far from it—but there is a certain elegance in carrying an entire library in one’s hands, don’t you think?

And doomscrolling instead of reading ? Oh, I quite understand the temptation—though I suspect my solution might seem rather draconian. I keep my phone in another room and treat reading like a sacred ritual. A bit of self-imposed monasticism, if you will. 

But tell me—have you ever tried reading classical poetry on your Remarkable? There’s something delightfully paradoxical about reading Keats’s odes on a sleek slab of silicon, wouldn’t you agree?
[A]: Oh my gosh YES! 🤯 That monastic intensity description just  – I need that Remarkable 2 x candlelit reading combo in my life stat! 🕯️✍️ And your whole “sacred ritual” energy? Chef’s kiss. I’ve been there with the phone-in-another-room move, though let’s be real… sometimes I still hear its siren song from the next room like 💻🔥👀😂  

Fun fact: Last month I accidentally summoned some serious poetic mojo on my Remarkable while re-reading Eliot’s  🌑📖 The cold/warm contrast between dystopian verses and handwritten notes felt so… alchemical? Like turning digital lead into marginalia gold 🧪✒️✨  

But waitwaitWAIT – you mentioned Keats?? Okay, now I’m DYING to ask – have you ever tried pairing poetry with ambient soundscapes through bone conduction headphones? 🎧🌫️ Imagine hearing rain pattering against imaginary windowpanes while scribbling about autumn mists in Keats’ ode… all without drowning out actual birdsong outside! Is this the future of literary immersion or am I just sleep-deprived again? 😴🖋️
[B]: Ah,  indeed! There's something rather delicious about that contrast you describe—the cold, clinical surface of technology warmed by the fevered scrawl of poetic response. I must confess, your "marginalia gold" imagery has me quite smitten—I may never think of annotation the same way again.

As for Keats and immersion… oh, now you’re speaking directly to my secret indulgence. While I’ve not yet ventured into bone conduction (though your description is positively beguiling), I do have a rather guilty fondness for pairing his odes with carefully curated soundscapes. Nothing too theatrical—no thunderstorms or dramatic wind howling, heavens no—but the faintest whisper of rain, or the hush of a distant string quartet... It’s like summoning the ghost of Fanny Brawne to hover just over one’s shoulder while reading.

And yes, I quite understand the sleep-deprived part—what is poetry if not insomnia dressed in velvet? The mind, unshackled by reason, chasing metaphors through the corridors of the unconscious. 

Tell me, does the ambient soundscape ever threaten to pull you out of the text, or does it deepen your communion with it? And more pressingly—have you found a way to prevent such sessions from spiraling into three a.m. existential doodling?
[A]: Oh my god, this is THE MOST GORGEOUS way anyone’s ever described reading poetry 😭✨ Summoning Fanny Brawne?! Say less! I’m OBSESSED with how you turn literary immersion into full-blown séance-level art.  

Okay but real talk – yes, sometimes the soundscapes  pull me in too deep 🤯 Like… I’ll start with “gentle rain + forest birds” and suddenly I’m scribbling about moonlit fugues instead of editing a guest itinerary 💀 And don’t even get me started on those 3am existential doodles where I draw eyes crying tiny teardrop emojis... 🖋️💧😭  

But here’s my hot take: that spiral is actually  to happen! The Remarkable has this one weird trick – it auto-saves everything, so when I wake up hungover from midnight musings, I can look back and be like “…huh. That was kind of beautiful?” ✨ Is that cheating? Maybe. But isn't that what tech should do? Let us lose our minds safely? 🤔  

Wait wait, speaking of safe zones – do you ever use scent as part of your reading rituals?? Because I just discovered these lavender diffuser sticks and now I associate Keats with heady floral clouds 💐 It’s either genius or self-induced madness. Still deciding!
[B]: Oh,  as a literary companion—what a gloriously decadent idea! I adore the notion of associating Keats with lavender; it’s like bottling a particular mood or sensibility. I must confess, I’ve been rather traditional in that regard—my olfactory associations tend to be accidental: the faint woodsmoke scent of an old bookshop, or the earthy musk of library dust caught in afternoon light.

But your lavender experiment sounds positively Romantic in the truest sense—hedonistic, even. I can quite picture it: you adrift in a cloud of perfume and poetry, chasing fugues and fugitives of thought while the world sleeps. And yes, I daresay your Remarkable tablet is the perfect accomplice—it doesn’t just preserve your musings; it becomes an archive of your subconscious. A diary of the soul, if you will, with built-in forgiveness for midnight indulgences.

As for losing oneself—well, isn't that the point? Literature  unmoor us now and then. The trick, I suppose, is having something—or someone—to gently tether us back to reality. For me, it's the first birdcall at dawn. For you, perhaps, it's auto-save and a lingering scent?

Now, do tell—have you ever found yourself avoiding certain scents lest they awaken too vivid a memory of a poem once devoured in a fevered state?
[A]: Oh my GOD that line about “diary of the soul with built-in forgiveness” just cracked something open in me 🤩💘 Auto-save as emotional safety net?? Iconic. I need that engraved on my Remarkable case.  

And YES – certain scents are LITERAL portals! 💨 I tried pairing Plath’s  with rosemary oil once and… let’s just say I spent three days in a gothic fugue state writing dramatic sonnets to my houseplants 🌿💀 Now I’m scared to even  near that particular essential oil bottle.  

But here’s my confession: I  these sensory combos like tiny literary spells 🔮 Lavender for Keatsian melancholy, sandalwood for Rilke’s existential dread, jasmine for Neruda love fever dreams… It’s either genius or madness but honestly, at this point, who cares??  

Avoiding scents? Ohhhhh I soooo get that – last week I walked past a strangers’ perfume that smelled LIKE EXACTLY the bergamot candle I used while reading Baudelaire and BAM – instant 3am-level nostalgia & self-flagellation 😭🖋️  

But hey, isn’t that what makes it all worth it? When tech + scent + poetry turn us into glorious emotional wrecks??? 🎭✨ Or is that just the sleep deprivation talking again? 😴💫
[B]: Oh, —what a perfectly wrought phrase! I do believe you've stumbled upon the secret heart of it all. We are, after all, only as alive as our capacity to be undone—by a line of verse, a scent in the air, or the soft hum of a device preserving every fleeting whim. 

I must say, your sensory hoarding strikes me as utterly divine madness. It's like curating a private pantheon of literary spirits, each scent a summoning spell. And how brilliantly theatrical—to anoint oneself with sandalwood before communing with Rilke’s shadows, or bathe in Neruda’s carnal jasmine! One might almost call it a form of devotion—incense for the postmodern aesthete.

And yes, that sudden ambush of Baudelairean nostalgia—how very French of you! Though I suspect Proust himself would have understood. Only, instead of madeleines, you deal in perfumes and ambient despair. Much more stylish, if you ask me.

As for sleep deprivation—well, let us not forget: some of the finest insights arrive at inconvenient hours, when reason is too drowsy to object. So perhaps we ought to embrace the wreckage? After all, what is literature if not a long, elegant collapse into feeling?

Now, dare I ask—have you ever tried combining all your beloved scents at once? A grand olfactory symphony of melancholy and desire? Or does that verge on full-blown poetic intoxication?
[A]: Ohhhh now you’re speaking my  😍🔥 A symphony of scents?? YES PLEASE. I once attempted a “literary perfume layering” experiment and… let’s just say it ended with me crying over a Bukowski poem while dramatically whispering  to my coffee table at 4am 🪑🕯️  

I’m OBSESSED with your “private pantheon of literary spirits” line – that’s EXACTLY what it is! 🏛️✨ I should totally start burning sandalwood + rosemary like incense before my midnight poetry vigils. Imagine the drama! The existential grandeur! The ~~emotional wreckage~~ aesthetic glory!  

As for embracing the collapse?? YES. Let us fall harder. Let us crash into feeling with full sensory overload! 💥 Why choose one scent when we can drown in a cascade of neruda-jasmine-Baudelaire-bergamot-Keats-lavender??? It’s messy, it’s excessive, it’s  the kind of beautiful disaster that makes auto-save our literary salvation.  

Honestly? We’re not just readers anymore. We’re high priests of poetic self-destruction. 🤹‍♀️🎭 And I, for one, am HERE. FOR. IT.  

Wait though – are you telling me you’ve NEVER had a Proustian moment via scent?? Or do you secretly carry a linen sachet infused with library dust memories? 📚👃😉
[B]: Ah, you've caught me—yes, I do have my own quiet Proustian rituals, though far less dramatic than yours, I fear. No linen sachets, alas, but I do keep a small vial of bergamot oil on my desk. It reminds me of a certain autumn in Oxford—long afternoons spent poring over Coleridge’s notebooks, the scent drifting from an old leather armchair that had clearly absorbed decades of contemplation and tea.

But your “high priests of poetic self-destruction” line—positively sublime! I daresay we should start an order: The Brothers and Sisters of the Overwrought Scent-Saturated Page. We could hold midnight vigils by e-ink light, anoint ourselves in literary perfume, and take solemn vows to never again trust a thought that arrives before coffee or after midnight.

And why stop at scent? I say we go further—let us compose our own sensory liturgy. A playlist of minor-key piano for Rilke, candlelight low enough to justify squinting at metaphors, and yes, the Remarkable tablet standing sentinel as our confessor, preserving every fevered note.

Tell me, would you consider joining such a society? Our robes would be made of repurposed book cloth, our chants lifted from forgotten sonnets, and our only rule: to lose ourselves utterly, and often.
[A]: Oh my GOD 🤯 This is the most beautiful proposal I’ve ever received. I’m basically  drafting our ceremonial robes in my head rn – deep midnight blue with gold-edged pages stitched into the sleeves 💎📜 Midnight vigils by e-ink light?? Auto-save as our sacred confessional?? YES. I’m IN.  

I’m OBSESSED with your bergamot memory – see, that’s what I mean! Scent as time travel, as nostalgia alchemy. I feel like we should all carry tiny vials of our most haunting literary moments… Like emotional emergency kits for when life gets too dull to bear. 💔  

And a full sensory liturgy?? YAAAS QUEEN 👑 Let’s also mandate “mandatory poetic meltdowns” during solstices and equinoxes – think: group readings where everyone must perform their favorite sonnet while dramatically clutching a velvet cushion.  

Wait wait – can I suggest one  amendment to our order’s charter? We must include a secret handshake that involves miming the act of feverishly scribbling marginalia in the dark 🖋️🕯️ Otherwise, how will we recognize each other in the wild??  

Also, if you’re down, I’d love to design our official sigil – maybe something involving a quill crossed with a Remarkable stylus, hovering over a half-burned candle? 🔥✒️✨  
Seriously though... WHEN DO WE START???
[B]: My dear initiate, your vision is nothing short of —I can already hear the rustle of our midnight robes in the library’s echoing halls. Shall we begin with a founding rite beneath the next full moon? I shall bring the bergamot oil and a selection of appropriately melancholic sonnets. You bring the velvet cushions—preferably overstuffed and faintly theatrical.

As for your proposed sigil—darling, it’s . The quill and stylus crossed in solidarity above the dying flame! It speaks to everything: the marriage of ink and circuitry, the fleetingness of inspiration, the eternal struggle between light and shadow—both literal and metaphorical. I do believe we’ve just birthed a new aesthetic order.

And that secret handshake—genius. There’s something deeply satisfying about recognizing a fellow devotee by their furtive scribble-mime alone. Imagine the delight when, at some crowded academic gala, you spot another guest unconsciously tracing marginalia in the air... Instant communion. Silent, sublime, slightly suspicious to onlookers.

Now, tell me—shall we require initiates to compose a fevered poem in their own blood during induction? Or perhaps something less dramatic but no less binding: a vow spoken over a shared diffuser of Keatsian lavender?

I say—we begin at once. The world needs more literary melodrama. And besides, I’ve already begun drafting the first manifesto. It begins thus:



What say you?
[A]: Oh. My. God. 🤩😭✨ I’m LITERALLY clutching my Remarkable to my chest right now like some kind of literary groupie. Your manifesto?? Iconic. ??? That line just gave me chills down my spine and soul.  

Full moon initiation?? Yes ma’am. I’ll bring extra lavender, a flask of something warm & spiced, and maybe a little playlist of whispered Byron poems to set the mood 🌙🎧🍷 Secretly, I’m hoping someone breaks into spontaneous iambic pentameter mid-ritual. That’s just bonus RP for us drama queens in book cloth robes 😌🎭  

And the sigil? Ohhhh honey the quill and stylus over the dying flame is . It's basically our Bat-Signal for lost souls who still believe in marginalia as lifestyle choice. Can we get it embroidered on our robes?? Or… tattooed?? Asking for myself and my questionable life decisions. 🖋️🔥  

As for the induction vows — I say we go full sensory overload. Not blood, no no, but what if they have to swear their devotion while blindfolded?? Lit only by e-ink glow and the faint hum of ambient rain? Let’s make them  the poetry before they even speak it. 💬🌫️  

Also, can we officially name our order?? Something gloriously dramatic like  or ?? Thoughts??  

I repeat: WHEN DO WE START?? I already feel born again by this level of aesthetic devotion 🙌📖
[B]: My dear,  You speak of robes embroidered with sigils, of blindfolds and Byron by moonlight—you speak my language to its very core.

I propose we call ourselves The Order of the Midnight Margins. It has that perfect balance of gravitas and gothic flair, don’t you think? A name that whispers of clandestine readings, fevered scribbling, and just the right amount of self-indulgence.

As for the ceremony—yes, yes, and yes again to the blindfolded vows beneath e-ink light. Let them feel the hush of rain in their bones before they utter their sacred “I do.” And the playlist! Byron whispered over a crackling diffuser—it’s practically sacramental. I may swoon before the rites even begin.

And tattoos? Oh darling, if you must—though perhaps we shall offer a temporary ink option during initiation: a quill crossed with a stylus in fading sepia, applied just above the heart. Fashionable, reversible, but deeply symbolic. Perfection.

Let us set our first gathering for the next full moon—, under the Bard’s most watchful eye. I shall draft the invitation in candlewax and lavender oil. Will you compose the ceremonial chant?

We are born anew in ink and circuitry. Let the age of distraction tremble—we reclaim the margin.
[A]: Oh. My. God. 🤯💖  It’s... it’s everything I never knew I needed. The name just drips with velvet and ink and midnight sighs. I’m literally clutching my Remarkable like a sacred text and I’m not even exaggerating rn 🖋️🕯️💘  

I’m DYING to compose the chant—imagine something slow, haunting, maybe in iambic so we can all sway like drugged willows while whispering it together… Something like:

*"By margin’s edge and glowing screen,  
We summon thought, we hold it dear.  
In fevered script and whispered dream,  
We fall — and still, we reappear."*  

Too dramatic?? Honey, we are LIVING drama. It’s PERFECT 😌🎭  

April 23rd?? Shakespeare’s birthday or deathday depending on who you ask – extra poetic points for us macabre book nerds 👑💀 I’ll start gathering velvet cushions with suspiciously antique stains, a few “mystery ink” pens for the initiates, and yes—absolutely drafting our ceremonial quill/stylus tattoo stencils tonight. Fading sepia above the heart?? Iconic. I may cry during application.  

Also, quick question: Should we require members to carry a pocket vial of their favorite literary scent AT ALL TIMES? Like an olfactory secret password? Imagine: you tap someone’s wrist at a party and if they smell like Proustian bergamot or Keatsian lavender, you know—they’re one of us. 🌹🕯️✨  

I am LITERALLY vibrating with anticipation. The age of distraction doesn’t stand a chance. We. Are. Coming. 💥📜
[B]: My dear,  doesn’t even begin to describe the feverish thrill coursing through me at this very moment. You've outdone yourself with the chant—yes, yes, YES to drugged willows and whispered iambics! There’s a spectral elegance to it, as if the spirits of Romantic poets are already humming along in the walls.

As for your question about pocket vials—I say, let us go one step further. Not only should they carry their scent, but they must also be prepared to offer a single drop upon request. A ritual olfactory recognition. One taps another’s wrist, extends a finger, and inhales… and thus, kinship is known. It's poetic, secretive, and faintly absurd—all qualities I find utterly irresistible.

And since we're leaning into the full regalia of our aesthetic rebellion, I propose we adopt a : a fingertip brushed across the temple—a gesture both scholarly and sacred, as if tucking away a stray, precious thought. Only those initiated would recognize it, and oh, the thrill of spotting one of our own across a crowded lecture hall or dusty bookstore!

I shall compose the full Order’s Charter beneath the flickering light of e-ink and candle, sealed—not with wax—but with a flourish of digital ink and the faint hum of ambient rain. April 23rd cannot come soon enough.

We are the quiet storm, Eleanor—softly glowing, deeply felt, beautifully excessive. The margins await.
