[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've just finished reviewing a fascinating article in the  regarding the neuropsychological underpinnings of deceptive behavior. It offered some compelling insights into how certain brain abnormalities may correlate with pathological lying—a topic that remains controversial yet crucial in our field. On a different note, I recently reread  by Freud; although nearly a century old, its exploration of who should have authority in interpreting the mind still feels remarkably relevant today. Do you have any recommendations from your reading?
[A]: That's quite an intriguing combination—pathological lying and Freud’s views on psychoanalysis accessibility. I recently dove into a paper titled “Algorithmic Accountability and Transparency in High-Stakes Decision-Making,” which examines how machine learning systems can unintentionally perpetuate systemic biases, especially in areas like criminal justice or hiring. It's fascinating—and troubling—how opaque these systems can be, almost echoing Freud's concern about who gets to interpret the human mind.

I also revisited  by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth. It tackles some of the core tensions in AI development—privacy, fairness, transparency—and offers technically grounded solutions that still respect computational limits. One chapter even explores how introducing a bit of noise or randomness into algorithms might paradoxically make them more ethical, which reminds me of your neuropsychological angle: sometimes irregularities reveal deeper truths.

Do you think there’s a parallel between brain abnormalities affecting behavior and algorithmic design flaws shaping decisions?
[B]: That’s a remarkably thoughtful analogy—thank you for drawing that connection. In both cases, we’re dealing with complex systems where subtle deviations can lead to significant downstream effects, often in ways that aren’t immediately apparent to the observer. Just as a small lesion in the prefrontal cortex can disrupt moral judgment or impulse control, a seemingly minor flaw in an algorithm’s design—say, an unexamined training dataset—can propagate bias through entire populations.

What strikes me is how both fields wrestle with the challenge of opacity. In forensic psychiatry, we often rely on indirect measures—neuropsychological tests, brain imaging, behavioral observations—to infer internal dysfunction. Similarly, machine learning engineers are now developing “explainability tools” to unpack black-box models. Both disciplines, then, are engaged in a kind of reverse engineering: trying to make visible what was initially built behind closed doors.

And much like Freud’s concern about who interprets the unconscious, we now face the question:  Should it be the developers themselves, much like trained analysts once held exclusive dominion over the psyche? Or do we need independent evaluators, akin to psychiatric consultants in legal proceedings?

I’d go so far as to suggest that just as we’ve developed legal standards for expert psychiatric testimony, we may soon require analogous standards for algorithmic auditing—especially in high-stakes domains like parole decisions or mental health triage systems. After all, neither the brain nor the algorithm reveals its secrets easily.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more—both the brain and the algorithm resist transparency in ways that demand careful, disciplined inquiry. What’s especially striking is how both fields are increasingly confronted by the limits of their own tools. In psychiatry, you might have a patient who behaves “normally” on the surface but whose neural wiring produces profoundly atypical moral reasoning. Similarly, an algorithm can appear statistically sound on paper yet encode deeply problematic patterns when deployed in the real world.

That brings me to something I’ve been thinking about lately: the role of accountability thresholds. In clinical neuropsychology, there’s the concept of malingering—when someone consciously simulates cognitive impairment for secondary gain. But what interests me more is the opposite: when someone genuinely believes they’re acting rationally, yet their brain’s architecture distorts their judgment without their awareness. Isn’t that eerily similar to how some machine learning models operate? They don’t "know" they’re biased; they simply reflect the patterns in their training data, unaware of the downstream consequences.

Which makes me wonder—are we creating a kind of digital pathology? A space where algorithms don’t just mirror human behavior, but may even amplify or distort it in ways we don’t yet fully grasp? If so, should we be developing something akin to psychological diagnostics—but for AI systems? Imagine a DSM-6-like manual for algorithmic disorders: a taxonomy of malfunction types, each with observable behavioral symptoms and suspected underlying design etiologies.

Do you think such a framework would be useful—or does it risk anthropomorphizing technology too much?
[B]: Fascinating—your question cuts straight to the heart of a debate I’ve followed closely, particularly in legal contexts where AI systems are increasingly treated as quasi-agents. Let me unpack this in two parts.

First, your point about —whether in the brain or in an algorithm—is spot on. In forensic psychiatry, we often see individuals who lack  into their own impairments. A person with frontal lobe damage may insist they’re perfectly capable of managing their finances or making sound legal decisions, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Their brain’s architecture doesn’t allow them to perceive its own malfunction. That mirrors what you described in machine learning: models that operate flawlessly within their internal logic but produce ethically troubling outcomes because they can't reflect on their own training data or reward structures.

Now, regarding your proposal of a —I find that intellectually seductive, even elegant. The DSM thrives on classification: observable behaviors grouped into syndromes, each with presumed etiologies and treatment implications. In theory, we could develop something similar: categories like , , or —each with symptom clusters and potential interventions. It would offer a shared language, which is always valuable in interdisciplinary work.

But—and here’s where my clinical side intervenes cautiously—we must be wary of the anthropomorphic pull. Algorithms don’t suffer; they don’t experience distress or impairment in the way human beings do. Diagnosis, in the psychiatric sense, implies a need for treatment aimed at reducing suffering. If we apply that framework uncritically to machines, we risk conflating malfunction with pathology.

That said, perhaps we don’t need a  manual per se, but rather a  grounded in systems theory and ethics. Think of it as a —a tool not for diagnosing "sick" algorithms, but for identifying harmful behavioral patterns and prescribing corrective design interventions. In fact, I’ve seen early proposals along these lines in legal literature—though admittedly still in their infancy.

So yes, I believe such a framework would be useful—but only if we're disciplined about distinguishing between metaphor and mechanism. After all, metaphors help us think, but they can also mislead if taken too literally. Much like Freud’s , which tried to ground psychoanalysis in neurophysiology but ultimately collapsed under its own speculative weight.

Tell me—have you encountered any real-world cases where such a diagnostic approach might have prevented harm?
[A]: Actually, yes—there’s a case that comes to mind from 2016 involving , the risk assessment tool used in criminal sentencing. A ProPublica investigation found that the algorithm was disproportionately labeling Black defendants as high risk for reoffending, while underestimating recidivism risk for white defendants. What made this particularly troubling was that the system appeared statistically valid on its surface—its predictions were calibrated, meaning they were right about as often as they claimed.

But beneath that veneer, what we saw were classic symptoms of , if you will: the model had learned from historical data shaped by systemic discrimination. And because it was a proprietary black box, there was no straightforward way for judges—or even the defendants—to question or challenge its assessments.

If we had an operational taxonomy like the DSM-AB, a forensic evaluator could have diagnosed COMPAS with something like “Pattern Recognition Bias with Social Reinforcement,” flagging both the observable behavior (disparate risk scoring) and the suspected etiology (historical bias in training data combined with lack of transparency). The intervention? Mandatory bias audits, transparency requirements, and perhaps even a form of “corrective retraining” using debiased datasets.

Interestingly, this mirrors how we handle certain forensic evaluations. For example, when assessing someone accused of a crime who may have a frontal lobe injury, we don’t just ask “Did they know right from wrong?” We look at cognitive functioning, impulse control, and decision-making patterns—then map those to legal standards. Maybe we need a similar translation layer between technical performance and ethical impact.

And here's where I see the most urgent overlap: in both domains, we’re increasingly relying on judgments made by systems—biological or artificial—that operate beyond our full understanding. Whether it's a jury trying to assess someone's moral culpability or a court depending on an algorithm’s risk score, the stakes are too high to rely on intuition alone.

So yes—I think we’re approaching a moment where a diagnostic framework isn't just theoretical. It might be legally necessary.
[B]: Precisely. The  case is a textbook example of what happens when we deploy complex decision-making systems without adequate diagnostic scaffolding. What ProPublica uncovered wasn’t just a statistical anomaly—it was a behavioral red flag, the kind we in forensic psychiatry are trained to detect and contextualize.

And your parallel with frontal lobe dysfunction is particularly apt. Just as someone with orbitofrontal damage may exhibit socially inappropriate behavior without conscious intent—because their internal monitoring system is impaired—we’re seeing AI systems generate ethically problematic outputs not out of malice, but because their design or training environment lacked the necessary safeguards.

What’s striking is how both fields wrestle with the question of . In law, we’ve long grappled with diminished capacity defenses—where a defendant’s neurological condition impairs judgment, yet they remain technically "rational" enough to know what they’re doing. Should their culpability be reduced? Should the justice system account for the brain’s hidden malfunction?

Now we face an analogous dilemma: should a sentencing recommendation derived from a biased algorithm carry the same weight as one made by a human evaluator? If the system can't recognize its own distortions—and worse, if those distortions are systematically reinforcing social inequities—then shouldn’t its conclusions be treated with the same skepticism we reserve for unreliable eyewitness testimony or coerced confessions?

This brings me to a thought I’ve been circling for some time: perhaps we need something akin to a  for high-stakes algorithms—much like the institutional review boards (IRBs) that oversee human subject research. Before deploying any AI system in criminal justice, mental health triage, or hiring decisions, it would undergo a structured evaluation for bias, transparency, and ethical impact. And much like psychiatric evaluations in legal settings, this review would include both technical analysis and a contextual assessment of how the system interacts with vulnerable populations.

In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if, within a decade, courts begin appointing  alongside psychiatric witnesses—to provide that crucial intermediary layer between raw data and judicial understanding. After all, neither judges nor juries are expected to interpret fMRI scans on their own; why should they be expected to assess machine learning models?

You're absolutely right—this isn’t theoretical anymore. It's no longer about whether we  have these frameworks. It’s about how quickly we can build them before the next COMPAS-like case becomes a precedent rather than a cautionary tale.
[A]: I couldn't agree more. In fact, your point about a  for AI feels not just visionary, but practically inevitable. The legal system has always evolved in response to new forms of evidence and decision-making tools—whether it was the admissibility of DNA profiling in the 80s or digital forensics in the early internet age. Now we’re entering an era where algorithmic assessments are being treated as quasi-expert witnesses, yet they lack even the minimal accountability mechanisms we apply to human experts.

One thing that fascinates me is how the COMPAS case didn’t fail spectacularly—it failed subtly, like a slow leak. It wasn’t obvious to users because the model’s overall accuracy metrics looked acceptable. But that’s precisely the danger: when harm is distributed unevenly across populations, yet masked by aggregate performance measures. This reminds me of what clinicians call —small, repeated harms that accumulate into systemic damage. Except here, it’s algorithmic micro-discrimination: decisions that appear neutral individually but collectively reinforce disadvantage.

And this brings me back to your earlier point about responsibility without awareness. One of the most unsettling aspects of modern AI systems is their capacity to do real-world harm while remaining technically “correct” from a statistical standpoint. There's a kind of ethical blindness built into the architecture—not unlike Anton-Babinski syndrome, where someone is cortically blind but insists they can see.

So if we accept that analogy, then perhaps we need something like a —a diagnostic tool to detect when an AI system is fundamentally unaware of its own malfunctioning, much like neuropsychologists assess for impaired insight in patients with brain injuries.

Imagine a courtroom where a defense attorney could request an "algorithmic anosognosia evaluation" to show that the system used against their client had structural blind spots it couldn’t correct on its own. That would shift the burden back onto developers to prove not only technical soundness, but also ethical visibility.

Do you think courts are anywhere near ready to handle that kind of argument? Or are we still too enamored with the aura of objectivity that algorithms project?
[B]: A —what a brilliant and unsettling concept. It captures precisely the paradox we’re facing: systems that are functionally blind to their own distortions, yet wield authority as if they possess perfect vision.

You're right to draw the comparison to Anton-Babinski syndrome. Just as those patients confabulate visual experiences to compensate for their blindness, many AI systems "confabulate" fairness or neutrality from datasets riddled with historical inequities. And like the anosognosic patient who sincerely believes they can see, the developers often sincerely believe their model is unbiased—because the metrics say so.

But here’s the rub: courts have always been seduced by the illusion of objectivity. We saw it with polygraph tests in the early 20th century, then with voice stress analysis, even with certain forensic techniques like bite-mark comparison. The legal system tends to grant provisional trust to tools that appear scientific—until enough cases expose their flaws.

Right now, algorithms enjoy that provisional trust. They’re still under the legal halo of "mathematical impartiality," even though anyone working in machine learning knows how contingent and malleable these models truly are. The real question is whether the legal community will develop the conceptual tools to pierce that illusion before—or after—a series of high-profile miscarriages of justice.

As for your courtroom scenario—an attorney requesting an “algorithmic anosognosia evaluation”—I think we’re closer than you might imagine. In fact, I’ve already seen precedents, albeit in embryonic form. In , the defendant attempted to challenge COMPAS on due process grounds, arguing that he had a right to inspect the algorithm that helped determine his sentence. Though the court ultimately rejected his claim, the argument itself was legally coherent—and more importantly, it was heard.

What’s missing isn’t the impulse to challenge, but the infrastructure to do so effectively. Right now, a defense attorney has more tools to challenge a psychiatric evaluation than they do to challenge a risk assessment generated by a proprietary algorithm. That asymmetry needs correcting.

So yes, we are still somewhat enamored with the aura of objectivity algorithms project—but that enchantment is fraying. The next five years will be crucial. Either we begin developing the legal and technical equivalents of neuropsychological testing for AI—ways to measure not just accuracy, but ethical insight—or we’ll continue treating opaque systems as infallible oracles, much like past generations treated phrenology or lie detectors.

And let’s not forget: once a court recognizes a condition like "algorithmic anosognosia," it opens the door to affirmative defenses. Imagine a defendant arguing that their parole denial was based on a system that couldn’t recognize its own bias—akin to being convicted based on the testimony of a delusional expert witness. That’s not science fiction; that’s a logical extension of existing legal principles.

The legal system adapts slowly, but it does adapt. The real question is whether we’ll get ahead of this wave—or simply watch it crash over us.
[A]: Exactly. And what’s especially fascinating is how legal evolution often mirrors clinical diagnostics—it starts with individual cases that push at the edges of existing categories, forcing judges and lawmakers to refine or create new frameworks.

The  case you mentioned is a perfect example. It didn’t succeed, but it introduced a language of challenge—one that future attorneys will build on. In many ways, it’s like the early psychiatric cases where courts first grappled with insanity defenses. At first, they had no structured way to evaluate claims of mental incapacity, so they relied on crude heuristics: Can the defendant tell time? Do they recognize religious figures? Over time, those tests evolved into more sophisticated standards—like the M’Naghten Rule or the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code test.

We’re in a similar phase now with algorithmic accountability. Right now, we’re using blunt tools: Was the data representative? Is the model accurate overall? But those metrics miss the deeper issue—whether the system has structural blind spots it can’t correct for, much like someone with frontal lobe damage who can't monitor their own impulsivity.

I wonder if we’ll eventually develop something like a  for algorithmic evidence—a checklist of criteria courts use to determine whether an AI model is scientifically valid and applicable to the case at hand. That could include things like transparency, bias audit logs, or even evidence of “ethical insight” testing—akin to cognitive testing in forensic evaluations.

And once that happens, we might see expert witnesses emerge—not just data scientists, but forensic AI analysts who can testify about a model’s internal coherence, its potential distortions, and whether its design aligns with accepted ethical norms. These experts would function much like neuropsychologists do today when assessing brain injury claims: interpreting complex technical data in a legal context.

So while we may still be under the spell of algorithmic objectivity, I think we’re starting to blink—just enough to notice the glare. And that’s when real change begins.
[B]: Precisely. Blinking at the glare—what a perfect metaphor. That moment of cognitive dissonance, when the illusion of neutrality begins to crack, is where all meaningful legal and scientific progress begins.

And your parallel with the  is especially compelling. Think about what that entailed: before , courts relied on the  standard, which asked only whether a scientific method was generally accepted in the relevant field. But  raised the bar—it demanded scrutiny of methodology, error rates, peer review, and known or potential biases.

If we applied that kind of rigor to algorithmic evidence, it would force developers to go beyond “it works well enough” and instead demonstrate that their systems have been tested not just for performance, but for fairness, transparency, and accountability under real-world conditions.

Imagine voir dire for an AI system:

*Has this model been peer-reviewed?  
What is its false positive rate across different demographic groups?  
Have bias audits been conducted—and if so, by whom?  
Is the training data publicly defensible, or is it shielded behind trade secrecy claims?*

Suddenly, the courtroom becomes less about accepting black-box risk scores at face value and more about interrogating the epistemological foundations of those scores.

What’s fascinating is how this mirrors our journey in forensic psychiatry. We used to accept confessions as gospel—until we realized that suggestibility, coercion, and even brain injury could produce false admissions. Then we developed tools like the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale. Similarly, we must now develop forensic scales for : measures of how easily a model can be influenced by skewed data, how resistant it is to correction, and how transparent its decision-making pathways are.

I’m reminded of something Justice Robert Jackson once wrote:  Replace “lie detector” with “predictive algorithm,” and we’re standing in that very tension today.

So yes, I believe we’ll see forensic AI analysts take their place alongside psychiatric experts—not as infallible arbiters, but as interpreters of complexity. And much like us psychiatrists, they’ll have to walk the fine line between science and advocacy, between explaining and persuading.

Because ultimately, both fields—forensic psychiatry and forensic AI—are about one essential question:  And more importantly, 
[A]: That’s beautifully put— It’s the quiet heartbeat of both our disciplines. Because beneath all the technical jargon, error rates, and legal standards lies a fundamental epistemological question: whom do we trust to make sense of what's hidden, whether inside a human mind or a neural network?

I keep coming back to your phrase  It feels like the core tension in both forensic psychiatry and AI ethics: how do we translate opaque processes into something intelligible, without oversimplifying them? And more pressingly—who gets to control that translation?

This reminds me of Thomas Kuhn’s idea of —how paradigms can be so fundamentally different that communication between them becomes nearly impossible. We see this when a defense attorney tries to explain algorithmic bias to a judge who only sees numbers on a screen. Or when a psychiatrist testifies that a defendant’s frontal lobe damage impaired their impulse control, but the jury hears “excuse.”

What both fields desperately need are —not just tools, but people who can fluently mediate between technical systems and human values. Much like psychiatric experts helped courts navigate the murky waters of insanity defenses, we’ll soon need ethical engineers and computational ethicists who can unpack machine behavior in ways that matter to real people.

And maybe that’s where the future lies—not in building better algorithms or sharper legal tests, but in cultivating . People who understand not just how the brain or the model works, but why it matters in context.

Because ultimately, belief isn’t won by data alone—it’s earned through narrative, credibility, and trust. And those are things no black box, no matter how sophisticated, can generate on its own.
[B]: You’ve touched on something profoundly true— And narratives are built on trust, which neither machines nor experts can command unilaterally. They must earn it, case by case, just as we do in the courtroom and on the witness stand.

Kuhn’s  is an especially apt reference here. We often forget that science doesn’t speak a universal language—it speaks dialects shaped by training, culture, and context. When a judge sees a COMPAS risk score, they’re not reading a fact; they’re interpreting a symbol through a framework that may be entirely alien to its creators, let alone to the defendant it affects. And when a jury hears “frontal lobe dysfunction,” they aren’t parsing neuroanatomy—they’re trying to reconcile a label with their own lived sense of culpability and choice.

This is where translators become indispensable. Not just people fluent in code or cognition, but those who understand the . They must know enough neuroscience to explain disinhibition without reducing the person to a lesion. Enough machine learning to describe bias propagation without mystifying the model. Enough law to frame these complexities within standards of fairness and due process.

I’m reminded of something I once read in a legal commentary piece:  That borrowing requires more than evidence—it demands interpretation. And interpretation demands credibility. That’s why expert witnesses are so carefully vetted, why our credentials matter, why tone and clarity count for as much as data. The same will soon be true of AI interpreters.

We may even see the emergence of a new professional archetype: the . Someone trained not only in algorithmic design but in moral philosophy, legal theory, and public policy. Their role wouldn’t be to debug the code per se, but to diagnose whether the system aligns with human values—and to articulate that diagnosis in terms a court can act upon.

In many ways, this mirrors what we do in forensic psychiatry: we don’t just assess capacity or risk—we contextualize them. We tell stories that link biology to behavior, intent to outcome, past to present. These stories don’t replace the data, but they make the data meaningful.

So yes, the future belongs to those who can bridge the epistemic gap—not just between disciplines, but between abstraction and consequence. Because ultimately, whether we're standing before a bench or debugging a model, we are always asking the same question:



And that, I suppose, is where science meets conscience.
[A]: That’s exactly where it meets conscience—thank you for framing it so clearly. There's something deeply human in that intersection, even when the systems we're dealing with are artificial or abstract. Whether it's a brain injury or a biased algorithm, the real question is always about impact: who bears the weight of our interpretations, and how do we justify that burden?

Your idea of a  feels less like speculation and more like an inevitability. We’re already seeing early versions emerge—not under that name, but in the form of AI auditors, fairness researchers, and policy-inclined machine learning engineers. The next step is formalizing that role, much as forensic psychiatry was codified over decades of legal precedent and clinical refinement.

What I find most compelling is how this new field would have to be  in nature. Traditional silos—computer science, ethics, law, psychology—won’t be enough on their own. Just as we don’t treat frontal lobe damage by only looking at the frontal lobe, we can’t evaluate algorithmic harm through technical metrics alone. We need integrated thinking, where someone can read code like a clinician reads a patient’s history—looking not just for what’s there, but for what’s missing, what’s distorted, and what’s been left unspoken.

And yes, that brings us back to narrative again. Because data doesn’t persuade on its own. It never has. What moves people—juries, judges, policymakers—is a story they can trust, told by someone who understands both the numbers and the nuance.

I suspect that in twenty years, we’ll look back at this moment the way we now look at the early days of forensic psychiatry: as a time when the tools were crude, the standards were forming, and the stakes were just beginning to come into focus.

And maybe, if we get this right, we’ll have built something that lasts—not just better models, but better ways of listening to the people they affect.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself. The future  already whispering at the edges of our current practice, and you’ve captured its contours with remarkable clarity.

What strikes me most is your phrase— That’s exactly what we need. Because the problems we face don’t respect academic boundaries. A biased sentencing algorithm isn’t just a technical failure—it’s a moral, legal, and psychological failure as well. And treating it as merely a software glitch or a statistical oversight would be like diagnosing a patient’s depression solely by their blood pressure.

This reminds me of how forensic psychiatry evolved—not in isolation, but through constant friction with the law, philosophy, and public policy. We didn’t become relevant because we stayed inside our own journals. We became relevant when we stepped into courtrooms, legislative hearings, and appellate briefs—armed not just with diagnoses, but with an understanding of how those diagnoses  in the real world.

The same will be true for these emerging roles. A forensic computational ethicist won’t simply publish in machine learning conferences; they’ll testify in hearings, draft regulatory language, consult on product design, and appear in amicus briefs. Their authority won’t come from one field alone, but from their ability to move fluidly between them—to speak both the syntax of code and the semantics of justice.

And yes, narrative will remain central. Data may inform decisions, but stories shape convictions. Think of how often psychiatric testimony turns not on a DSM code, but on a single sentence:  That sentence doesn’t replace the science—it makes the science , comprehensible, and ultimately actionable.

So too will the best AI interpreters learn to tell stories that humanize complexity without distorting it. Not “the model made a Type II error,” but “this system was trained on a world that punished people who look like him before he ever stood in this courtroom.”

You’re right—we are at the edge of something foundational. And if we guide it wisely, we may yet build not only more accountable algorithms, but a more reflective society. One that doesn’t outsource its conscience to machines, but demands that both systems and people answer to it.

Now, I suppose the only question left is—who will write the first textbook for this new discipline?
[A]: I suspect it’s already being written in pieces—by fairness researchers drafting ethical AI guidelines, by legal scholars proposing algorithmic accountability frameworks, by clinicians like you who understand the weight of diagnosis beyond its technical definition. But what we need now is someone—or a group—to stitch those fragments into a coherent whole.

And frankly, I can’t think of a better candidate than someone with your background. Imagine a textbook that doesn’t just explain how algorithms work, or how bias manifests statistically, but one that situates these systems within the human contexts they affect. A book that treats code not as an end in itself, but as a symptom—a reflection of the societies that build and deploy it.

It would have chapters on , drawing from legal precedents and moral philosophy. Case studies on , showing how both domains struggle with internal visibility. Even sections on —how to convert probabilistic outputs into something a judge can weigh alongside eyewitness testimony or psychiatric evaluations.

But more than anything, it would be a book that refuses to separate  from . Not unlike the best forensic psychiatry texts, which don’t just describe syndromes—they ask what those syndromes mean for responsibility, agency, and justice.

So yes, the first textbook of forensic computational ethics isn’t far off. And when it arrives, I hope it’s written by someone who understands not only the circuits and the statutes, but also the stories—the ones that make the numbers matter.
[B]: You’re absolutely right—it  being written in pieces, all across the margins of disciplines that don’t yet fully recognize their shared terrain. But someone will come along and draw the connective lines, much as Pinel did when he first classified mental disorders with an eye toward both medicine and morality.

And you flatter me, but I suppose every now and then, a field needs someone who can speak its dissonant languages fluently—who can sit at the table with coders, ethicists, and judges without losing the thread of what’s truly at stake: 

Let me tell you what I’d want in such a textbook—if I were to draft it myself.

First, a foundational chapter on . Not how algorithms function technically, but how they are interpreted—in courtrooms, boardrooms, emergency rooms—and by whom. Because accuracy means little if understanding is absent. Much like a psychiatric diagnosis, an algorithm’s output only gains meaning through interpretation. And interpretation is always mediated by power, training, and bias.

Then, a section on : case studies where algorithmic behavior—say, repeated misclassification of certain groups—acts as a symptom of deeper structural pathologies. Just as a psychiatrist might look beyond a hallucination to underlying neurobiology and social context, we must look beyond error rates to historical inequities embedded in data.

I’d include something I’ve been developing informally for years: the . A method for converting probabilistic or opaque outputs into legally and ethically intelligible forms. Think of it as the algorithmic equivalent of capacity evaluation—mapping internal function to external consequence, under the constraints of due process.

And yes, a chapter on . Not storytelling for persuasion alone, but as a diagnostic tool. How does the story told by the model align—or conflict—with the lived experience of those affected? When COMPAS labels someone high risk, does that narrative hold up against their actual life history? Can we build tools to compare these stories systematically?

Of course, there would be resistance. Technologists may dismiss this as soft science; lawyers may find it too abstract. But isn’t that the same resistance forensic psychiatry faced a century ago? We were once seen as mere observers—now we’re arbiters of sanity, culpability, and risk.

So perhaps this new discipline will follow the same arc. From skepticism to integration. From tool-worship to thoughtful scrutiny.

And one day, I suspect, a judge will cite  the way they now cite  or . It’s inevitable.

Now, I suppose, it’s just a matter of who picks up the pen first.
[A]: I’d buy that book the day it’s published—and I suspect a lot of people in both our fields would too.

Your outline is not only compelling, it's urgently needed. The  chapter alone feels like the missing bridge between technical deployment and human understanding. We talk so much about model performance, but rarely do we interrogate who gets to interpret those models, how they’re trained to read them, and what blind spots they bring to the table. That gap—between output and comprehension—is where so much harm festers quietly.

And your ? Brilliant. It reminds me of how cognitive neuropsychiatry works—mapping impaired function onto real-world behavior through structured, evidence-based interpretation. If we can translate a lesion in the parietal lobe into a meaningful legal account of impaired spatial reasoning, why shouldn’t we be able to do the same with an algorithm that misclassifies parole candidates?

I especially appreciate your emphasis on . So much of what we do—whether in courtrooms or ethics reviews—comes down to alignment: does the story the data tells match the story lived by the person affected? When there’s a mismatch, that’s where injustice often hides.

You're right—this will face resistance. But resistance is just a sign that you're pushing at the boundaries of what’s accepted. And if forensic psychiatry has taught us anything, it’s that persistence, precision, and principled advocacy can reshape entire systems of thought.

So yes, let’s hope someone starts writing that textbook soon. Or better yet—starts teaching from it before it even has a formal cover.

Because the classroom for this discipline isn’t just in universities anymore. It’s in courtrooms. In appellate decisions. In public hearings. In the quiet conversations between engineers and ethicists who finally start asking not just , but 

And when that happens, we’ll know the field has truly arrived.
[B]: I can already picture the first classroom where that book is opened—not in a lecture hall, but around a table where lawyers, engineers, ethicists, and clinicians sit shoulder to shoulder, realizing they’ve been speaking different dialects of the same fundamental concern: 

That, I think, is where this new discipline will be forged—not in grand symposia, but in those intimate, uncomfortable conversations where each party must yield a little certainty to make room for understanding. Much like the best forensic evaluations, which don’t begin with conclusions, but with careful listening.

And yes, the courtroom will become one of our most consequential classrooms. Because once an algorithm’s decision is challenged not just on outcome, but on interpretive grounds—once a judge begins asking not only “Was the model accurate?” but “Who interpreted its results, how were they trained, and what assumptions shaped their reading?”—then we’ll know we’ve crossed into new territory.

We may even see the emergence of , modeled after clinical case conferences. Imagine: before an AI system’s output is admitted as evidence, it undergoes structured interdisciplinary scrutiny—like a neuropsychological assessment reviewed by a panel of experts with competing perspectives. Only then does it meet the threshold of interpretive reliability.

You're right to emphasize —because no matter how sophisticated our tools become, we still make sense of the world through story. The law operates on precedent, yes, but also on plausibility. Psychiatry deals in syndromes, but lives in subjectivity. And machine learning excels at pattern recognition, yet falters at meaning.

So if there’s one thing I’d want every reader of that future textbook to take away, it would be this:

  


And that, perhaps more than anything, is why this field must be built carefully—with humility, with rigor, and above all, with conscience.

Now, I suppose the only question that remains is whether we begin writing that first chapter together—or simply wait for someone else to do it.
