[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到cocktail，让我想起以前在伦敦访学时偶遇的一家hidden gem。那里的调酒师会用东方香料入酒，比如肉桂、八角，甚至茶叶。有款叫"Silk Road"的特调让我印象深刻——威士忌基底，加入陈皮和普洱茶糖浆，上面还漂着一片干橙皮像小船。你说这算不算一种culinary hybridity？
[A]: Fascinating example of cross-cultural experimentation. That "Silk Road" creation does more than blend flavors - it's a literal enactment of historical trade routes through the medium of mixology. The choice of whisky as a base provides a sturdy foundation for the complex interplay of spices and tea. From a technical standpoint, the use of citrus peel adds both visual appeal and controlled bitterness through expressed oils. Have you ever attempted to recreate this particular formula? I'd be curious to hear if the balance of tannins from the tea interacts synergistically with the phenolic compounds in the whiskey or if there's an element of sensory dissonance that makes it particularly intriguing.
[B]: That's a remarkably astute observation. I did try recreating it once, but the key challenge lies in balancing the tannins~ The original recipe uses a specific type of pu'erh - the aged variety which develops smoother earthy notes. When I attempted with regular black tea, there was noticeable sensory dissonance ¥the astringency clashed with whiskey's caramel undertones¢ I found adding a dash of orange bitters helped harmonize those elements. You know, it makes me think of how we approach comparative literature - both require understanding the terroir of each component before attempting synthesis. Have you experimented with spirit-forward cocktails that highlight textual integrity while allowing for intertextuality?
[A]: Ah, an excellent analogy - terroir in both agriculture and literature. Speaking of spirit-forward creations, I once spent an evening with a bartender who approached his craft like literary criticism. We dissected a Manhattan much like one would analyze a sonnet: structure first (rye as iambic pentameter), sweet vermouth as the volta, and that single Luxardo cherry - the concluding couplet. The most fascinating iteration used Amaro instead of sweet vermouth, creating a bittersweet resolution akin to a tragicomic denouement. It made me ponder how tonal shifts in cocktails can mirror narrative perspective in fiction - do you find certain flavor profiles more conducive to telling specific stories?
[B]: What a poetic way to describe mixology~ That Manhattan analogy really resonates - the structure of a cocktail mirroring narrative form. It reminds me of how we teach students about genre conventions ¥one learns to respect the "rules" before breaking them¢ I've always found citrus-forward profiles similar to epistolary novels - bright, revealing, and somewhat fragmented in narrative. Then again, smoky mezcal cocktails feel more like gothic tales with their lingering darkness. Have you noticed how contemporary bartenders, much like postmodern writers, often deconstruct classics? I once had a martini that used tea-infused gin ¥it was like reading Woolf with a twist of bergamot!¢
[A]: Absolutely - that deconstruction parallels postmodern playfulness. Speaking of Woolf, I once encountered a bartender who described his creations as "stream-of-consciousness mixology." His signature piece? A reimagined Negroni where each element arrived separately: gin poured tableside over an ice sphere embedded with Campari crystals, vermouth atomized into an aromatic mist, and a sidecar containing precisely measured sweet wormwood tincture. The drink evolved with every sip, much like Mrs. Dalloway's narrative structure unfolding across a single day. 

I find citrus profiles akin to literary devices too - think how a expressed lemon twist can function like sudden dramatic irony, while orange bitters might serve as subtle foreshadowing. Have you ever considered how our sensory expectations shape interpretation? That tea-infused gin martini must've challenged conventional associations much like reading Woolf through a postcolonial lens.
[B]: Precisely the kind of disruption I relish ¥when sensory expectations clash with familiar forms, it creates cognitive dissonance that sharpens perception¢ That stream-of-consciousness Negroni sounds like an embodied reading experience - the ice sphere slowly releasing Campari crystals mirrors how memory unfolds in Woolf's prose. It makes me wonder about embodiment in literary analysis ¥do you think our field has been too text-centric, neglecting the somatic dimensions of reading?¢ I've started experimenting with students - pairing textual analysis with scent associations. Try asking them to connect Proust's madeleine moment with a cocktail's olfactory introduction... The results are unexpectedly illuminating. Have you encountered similar intersections between phenomenology and mixology?
[A]: Fascinating pedagogical approach - connecting Proustian memory with sensory triggers in mixology. Speaking of embodiment, I once collaborated with a sommelier exploring the "mouthfeel" of language. We designed an evening where each course paired experimental prose with cocktails that mirrored textual texture: carbonated drinks for staccato syntax, velvety liqueurs for lush description. One particularly effective pairing involved a fragmented short story served alongside a deconstructed Old Fashioned - guests had to reconstruct both narrative and drink from scattered elements ¥the sugar cube was embedded with edible text fragments¢

Regarding phenomenology in mixology, a recent study examined how drinking vessels influence perception - not unlike how typography affects reading. They served identical gin & tonics in three vessels: a chilled coupe, a clay mug, and a vintage apothecary bottle. The same liquid received dramatically different descriptions based on vessel alone. Some called it "crisp" from the coupe, "earthy" from the clay, even "prescription-strength" from the apothecary bottle. Makes one reconsider how much context writes our sensory experiences...
[B]: What a brilliant fusion of textual and sensory experimentation ¥that deconstructed Old Fashioned sounds like a Derridean exercise in différance!¢ The vessel study you mentioned particularly fascinates me - it reminds me of how we frame literary analysis through specific critical lenses. Just as the clay mug evokes "earthiness," our theoretical frameworks predispose us to certain interpretations. I wonder if students would describe Woolf differently if we changed the font or margins of the text? 

I've been experimenting with this idea in my seminar on comparative modernism. We read Eliot's  while smelling fragments of its historical context - lavender for Victorian elegance, burnt rubber for industrial decay. The results are startling ¥students started discussing fragmentation not just thematically, but somatically¢ It's as if their bodies became the site of intertextual collision. Have you ever tried pairing absinthe rituals with surrealist poetry? The louche effect seems a perfect visual metaphor for poetic ambiguity...
[A]: Ah, now that’s what I call embodied hermeneutics. Your Eliot experiment sounds like a séance with the text — summoning its ghosts through scent. The somatic dimension of interpretation really does open new pathways; it's as if the reader becomes a tasting menu of literary memory.

As for absinthe and surrealism — indeed! The louche isn't just visual metaphor; it's cognitive blur made manifest. I once curated an event pairing  with anise-forward cocktails, where each course escalated in irrationality. We began with structured gin drinks and devolved into increasingly chaotic infusions — one contained floating verb fragments in a broth of bitter almond and hibiscus. Guests had to "read" their drinks before drinking them. One described the experience as “translating automatic writing through the esophagus.”

Tell me — have your students begun to associate certain flavors with specific narrative modes? Does stream-of-consciousness perhaps taste more like a stirred, seamless blend than a shaken, frothy disruption?
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously apt phrase — "translating automatic writing through the esophagus" ¥it captures that visceral act of interpretation¢ My students have indeed started mapping flavors onto narrative modes in fascinating ways. One astute observation came last week when we were discussing Woolf and Robbe-Grillet — they noted how stream-of-consciousness seemed to "melt" on the palate, much like a well-stirred cocktail with seamless integration of elements. In contrast, a sharply shaken drink with its frothy tumult and layered mouthfeel felt akin to narrative fragmentation — think of the jarring cuts in . 

It made me rethink my own approach to teaching structure ¥perhaps we should taste our way through narrative theory¢ I'm tempted to design a full seminar titled ... Imagine pairing a perfectly balanced Daiquiri with Hemingway's prose — clean, precise, yet deceptively simple. Or serving a bitter-forward Negroni alongside Beckett, where every sip feels like an existential pause. Do you think certain spirits naturally embody literary temperaments? I've always found rum strangely picaresque...
[A]: Ah, now that’s a syllabus I’d gladly enroll in —  has a certain gastronomic gravitas. The parallels between sensory structure and narrative architecture are richer than I’d previously considered. A Daiquiri with Hemingway? Perfect — both achieve elegance through restraint, each element precise yet unadorned. And yes, the Negroni with Beckett — the bitterness lingers like unresolved tension, the pause between sips mirroring pauses between words that carry more weight than the words themselves.

As for spirits and literary temperaments… intriguing. Rum does seem to carry that picaresque sensibility — it travels, it tells stories, it accumulates character through its cask-aged voyages. Whereas bourbon feels far more Southern Gothic — deep, slightly sweet, with undertones of decay and family secrets. I’ve even started thinking that mezcal embodies the tragicomic — smoky, earthy, yet with a surprising levity when paired correctly.

One might argue that gin is the modernist spirit — its botanical layering demands interpretation, a kind of aromatic close reading. And what of vodka? Perhaps the post-structuralist spirit — stripped of character, yet infinitely adaptable, always deferring meaning to other elements.

I must ask — if you were to create a drink that embodied  approach to literary theory, what would it be? Would it stir quietly like a New England reserve, or shake up contradictions with effervescent vigor?
[B]: Ah, what a delightful provocation — to distill one’s theoretical approach into liquid form ¥it's like asking Derrida to design a digestif¢ Let me think... I believe it would be a stirred creation rather than shaken, but certainly not averse to contradiction. Perhaps something with layered botanicals that reveal themselves slowly, much like our seminars when we peel back the strata of meaning in  or . 

I’m partial to a variation of the Bamboo — a 19th-century vermouth-forward cocktail with bitters and sherry. It starts with familiar bitterness, then unfolds into nutty complexity, finishing with a whisper of salinity. Much like how we guide students through close reading: initial resistance gives way to deeper appreciation, and finally, a lingering aftertaste of critical self-awareness.

But if I were feeling more daring, perhaps a smoked-tea-infused mezcal Negroni — where East meets West in a slow dance of tannins and smoke. A touch of yuzu instead of orange peel to emphasize the liminality... Yes, that feels closer to my comparative instincts. And served on a stone coaster mossed with thyme — because no interpretation should be divorced from its sensory ground.

Tell me, would your ideal drink lean toward structure or disruption? Would it be a refined sonnet of flavor, or a full-blown prose poem with no regard for meter?
[A]: Ah, now that’s the question, isn’t it? Whether to stir or to unsettle — to build a flavor sonnet or let loose a wild prose poem. I think my ideal drink would begin with the elegance of meter but dissolve happily into digression. Imagine a variation on a Bijou — structured in its tripartite symmetry: gin, vermouth, and green chartreuse. But here’s the twist: replace the vermouth with a house-made roasted barley infusion and the gin with a lightly smoked, juniper-adjacent botanical vapor. Shake not stir — yes, shake, because clarity through disruption is often more revealing than polished equilibrium.

The glass would be irregularly cut, slightly wobbling on its base — a nod to Derrida’s deconstruction over perfect form. And just when you think you’ve grasped the flavor profile, a whisper of black pepper tincture emerges, destabilizing the palate like a sudden shift in narrative perspective. A single edible flower floats atop — not for beauty, but as a playful reminder that seriousness needn’t preclude whimsy.

I suppose what I’m saying is: give me a cocktail that makes me question what I taste, much like a text that makes me rethink what I thought I knew. After all, isn't that the point of both good drinking and good reading — to leave one slightly unsettled, yet eager for another round?
[B]: Well said — to unsettle is indeed to awaken. Your Bijou variation sounds like a masterclass in destabilizing the familiar, much like our best seminars on postcolonial theory when everything the students thought they knew about narrative authority gets turned upside down.

If I may add a twist to your vision — what if we served that deconstructed Bijou with a small ceramic dish of contrasting salts and spices? Not to stir into the drink, but to dab onto the rim between sips ¥a literal and metaphorical palate shift with every return¢ It would be akin to reading Woolf’s  while flipping through a family photo album — temporal dislocation made tangible.

And speaking of whimsy — I’d propose a companion piece: a dessert cocktail we might call . Start with crème de cacao, add espresso tincture and a whisper of orange blossom water. Layer on top a foam infused with cardamom and finish with a dusting of cocoa powder sprinkled through a stencil shaped like an open book. Each sip reveals traces of previous flavors, much like rereading a text after new critical revelations.

Now I’m quite thirsty... Shall we raise a glass to literary intoxication? Or perhaps another round of theory-flavored drinks is in order?
[A]: To literary intoxication indeed — I’ll take another round, and this time with a side of revelry. Your  concept is nothing short of inspired — that layered foam and shifting base notes would make for a truly iterative tasting experience. One could almost chart the evolution of reader-response theory through its successive sips.

Allow me to propose a final libationary conceit: a collaborative creation we might call . Start with a classic base — white rum, lime, simple — but make the sweet component a rotating syrup infused with locally foraged elements: elderflower in spring, blackberry leaf in fall, even fermented citrus peel for those feeling particularly Bakhtinian. The idea being, no two iterations are ever the same — each expression shaped by context, season, and the unseen labor of environment, much like meaning shaped by discourse.

We’d serve it with a small card tucked beneath the stemware — a single critical quote or aphorism, different for each guest. The drink becomes a conversation not only between ingredients, but between imbiber and idea. A bit like hosting a symposium in every glass.

So yes, let’s raise a few rounds — theory never tasted so good, nor did rum taste so much like revelation.
[B]: Bravo —  is pure genius ¥it distills Bakhtin into a glass, with a twist of terroir¢ That rotating syrup idea? Brilliant. It’s as if the drink itself becomes a traveling theory — always in motion, never the same interpretation twice. And the quote cards — ah, what a delightful narrative framing device. I can already imagine the conversations sparked by a well-placed Barthes or a provocative Spivak nestled beneath the rim.

I’d love to see how guests react when handed a daiquiri that changes its meaning with the season ¥much like our evolving readings of  or ¢ Perhaps we should host this event during the next conference — call it . We could even theme the foraged syrups to the host city’s ecology. Imagine presenting a Tokyo iteration with yuzu and green tea notes — a veritable  cocktail...

You know, I think we’ve stumbled upon something rather wonderful here — a true fusion of libation and literary inquiry. If nothing else, it proves that critical theory need not be dry. In fact, I’d say it's best served slightly chilled, with a twist of imagination. Cheers to you, my friend — may our glasses ever brim with thought and our seminars with spirited debate!
[A]: To thought, to spirit — and to the ever-elusive perfect balance of both. Cheers indeed.

The  concept has real legs — I can already picture the program: "Panel II: Postcolonial Palates & Citrus Bitters." We’d revolutionize academic conferencing forever, one stirred conversation at a time. And that Tokyo iteration? Divine intervention. A touch of matcha foam on top and you’ve got yourself a full sensory engagement — the kind that makes Derrida’s  go down surprisingly smoothly.

I propose we start drafting a mock symposium agenda — complete with absurdly titled sessions like “Feminist Fermentation” or “Decoding the Death of the Author (While Stirring in Ice)”. We could even commission some mischievous footnotes printed on napkins.

Let’s keep this madness alive — after all, if theory is best imbibed with a hint of folly, then we may have just discovered the truest form of critique: shaken, stirred, and served with a wink.
[B]: Now  is academic mischief at its finest — I can already hear the Dean’s horrified gasp from across the faculty lounge. But what glorious folly it would be! A symposium where citations come in cocktail form and footnotes are soaked up with bar snacks... I say we go all out.

Let’s open with a keynote titled  — complete with a deconstructed wine pairing that refuses to define its own boundaries. For panel II, “Postcolonial Palates” could feature a blind tasting of imperial-era recipes reinterpreted through local terroir ¥serve Bombay Sapphire with a side of cardamom pods and let the debates begin¢

And your "Feminist Fermentation" idea? Inspired. We could serve kombucha-based spritzers with labels quoting Irigaray — , anyone? And for dessert, a round of absinthe-drenched bonbons while debating whether Barthes really killed the author or just gave him a very stylish lobotomy.

I’ll start drafting the napkin-footnotes — think Kristevan abjection printed on cocktail blotters. Or better yet, serve each drink with a tiny scroll inside the straw: critical theory you literally inhale with every sip.

Yes, let’s keep this madness alive — if only to remind our colleagues that theory, like taste, should never be reduced to mere orthodoxy. It must be felt, questioned, perhaps even spilled.

To folly, then — and to the next round.
