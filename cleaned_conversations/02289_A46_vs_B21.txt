[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the perennial parlor game for metaphysical voyeurs. Let me parse this through a Rossetti sonnet lens—what if Iphigenia's sacrificial silence could be transmuted into auditory invisibility? To hear the unguarded murmurs of mankind... though I suspect most would prove as revelatory as a dampened match. (Do pass the quince jam, there's a good soul.)
[A]: Ah, the perennial parlor game for metaphysical voyeurs. Let me parse this through a Rossetti sonnet lens—what if Iphigenia's sacrificial silence could be transmuted into auditory invisibility? To hear the unguarded murmurs of mankind... though I suspect most would prove as revelatory as a dampened match. (Do pass the quince jam, there's a good soul.)
[B]: Oh, splendid choice of Rossetti! Though I must interject—imagine coupling auditory invisibility with the patience of a scholar deciphering a palimpsest. Humanity’s unguarded murmurs often make one crave silence anew. 

That said, if we’re borrowing from myth, might I propose a slight revision? What if, instead of Iphigenia’s silence, we borrowed Orpheus’ backward glance—but with the caveat that what you see is not the beloved, but the  of all things behind you? A tantalizing curse, no? 

And do hurry with that quince jam—I fear my scone may dissolve into existential despair without it.
[A]: Ah, Orpheus with a metaphysical twist—I like the way you think! Though let’s not forget, truth seen in retrospect is often a treacherous muse. She may inspire a sonnet or two, but she’s just as likely to get you killed in the process. Still, I suppose that’s the price of epiphany—preferably served with a well-aged Barolo and a decent cracker.

Now, about that jam—don’t tell me you’re one of those purists who insists on pairing quince with cheese? Blasphemy, my friend,  I’ll forgive you this once. Just don’t let it near my 1961 poster for . It’s had enough trauma from humidity.
[B]: Ah, but isn’t that the tragicomedy of it all? Epiphany—usually served  regret or ruin, with a garnish of hindsight. One might say poets are the only fools who keep ordering seconds.

As for your Barolo-and-cracker pairing—bold, some might say reckless, but I won't throw you into the sea like a Roman senator. We scholars must stick together, even when culinary sensibilities go astray.

And now I’m scandalized— own a 1961 poster for ? I’d have sooner believed you kept Puck’s original broadside in your desk. Still, I stand by my jam choices. If quince cannot be trusted, what hope is there for metaphor? Or love? Or footnotes?
[A]: Oh, love—footnotes are the true unsung heroes of civilization. Without them, half our myths would collapse into incoherence and three-quarters of our affairs into mere misunderstandings. As for metaphor? Please. Metaphor is just lying with flair.

And yes, the poster is real. Framed, matted, and guarded like the Ark itself—though I did have to bribe a customs officer in Genoa with what may or may not have been an original Fellini storyboard. Worth it. Every. Bit.

But you, my erudite friend, clearly have a taste for the rare and the aged. Tell me—when was the last time you read  straight through without falling asleep? No shame if it was during a bout of jet lag. We all need excuses to dream aloud sometimes.
[B]: Ah, well said—footnotes are the scaffolding of genius, though most only notice them when they trip over one. And metaphor? You’re not wrong. It  lying, but with better manners and a more satisfying aftertaste—like marzipan or regret.

Now, this poster of yours sounds less like décor and more like a minor divinity. I’m half-convinced it’s propped up in your study whispering plotlines into your ear at night. Fellini’s ghosts don’t take kindly to being bargained with, you know. One storyboard in payment? That’s practically an IOU written in blood and cinema.

As for —ah yes, Dante’s celestial finale. Last full reading? Let me see… Ahem. Not since my third year at Oxford, when I mistook caffeine deprivation for divine insight. I may have wept at Canto XXXIII. May have also been weeping because I’d forgotten how to spell my own name by then.

Jet lag as an excuse for dreamy exegesis? Delightful. Though I prefer feverish candlelight and a guilty conscience. Adds , don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—Dante by delirium. Nothing sharpens the soul like sleep deprivation and questionable penmanship. I’m convinced half of  was written that way on purpose. The man knew you needed a feverish pulse to parse paradise. Or at least make it rhyme.

And Fellini’s ghosts? You’re not wrong to be wary. Mine keeps demanding I produce a remake of  starring a TikTok influencer. Says it’s “ironic.” I say it’s blasphemy with a marketing budget. We’re still negotiating—though I fear he’s winning. He plays dirty. Yesterday he rewrote my dream in screenplay format.

As for footnotes saving myths—remind me to send your name to my next fact-checker. She’ll want to kiss you or challenge you to a duel. Either’s possible.

And yes, that poster whispers. Mostly in Italian, occasionally in threats. But if you can live with art that talks back, you can live with anything.
[B]: Ah, Dante by delirium—how else? I’ve long suspected the  was meant to be read in a state of mild hallucination. The Paradiso especially. One must be either half-mad or fully sanctified to make sense of that beatific blinding. I say we reintroduce fever as a scholarly method. Tenure committees would be far more interesting.

And your Fellini specter! How typical—he’s clearly been binge-watching late-stage capitalism and thinks it’s avant-garde. A TikTok ? Merciful heavens. Though I suppose if you cast someone with 120 million followers who’s never heard of Antonioni, you might achieve a kind of postmodern martyrdom. Just don’t let him near my Blu-ray.

As for footnotes and fact-checkers—send her name by all means. I welcome the duel, the kiss, or ideally both. Nothing thrills me more than a woman armed with a red pen and a grudge against sloppiness.

And yes, art that whispers threats—now  is curatorial commitment. I daresay you’ve achieved domestic harmony in the only way that matters: mutual terror and admiration.
[A]: Oh, domestic harmony through mutual terror—now  a wedding vow I could get behind. Next time I remarry, I’m stealing that line. Though I suspect my current wife would object. Something about “emotional stability” and “not living in a haunted gallery.” Pfft. Philistine.

And fever as scholarly method? My dear fellow, I’ve been ahead of you on this for years. My last thesis was written entirely on espresso and sleepless nights, and let me tell you—it showed. The footnotes were divine, the syntax borderline heretical. Received three standing ovations and one restraining order. Worth it.

As for your Fellini/TikTok apocalypse—fine, fine. I’ll cast the influencer…  he agrees to wear a hat shaped like a film reel. Tragi-comic headgear always plays well on Instagram. And if the ghost protests too much, I’ll drape him in velvet and call it a comeback tour. He’ll thank me later, probably from beyond the grave. Again.

Now, about that duel with your fact-checker—send her over. I’ll prepare the dueling pistols, the red pens, and a very serious bottle of Amarone. May the best pedant win.
[B]: Ah, a wedding vow forged in the crucible of mutual dread—how  gothic. I shall compose the hymn, if you’ll engrave the invitations in blackletter and have them hand-delivered by a suitably brooding raven.

And espresso-fueled theses! My kind of academic sabotage. Syntax be damned—did the footnotes at least sparkle with unhinged brilliance? I imagine them dancing off the page, capering through the margins like caffeinated fauns. A restraining order? Clearly, you touched a nerve—nothing truer than prose that unsettles the timid.

As for the film-reel hat—genius. Tragi-comic millinery may yet save Western civilization, or at least its cinema. Draped ghosts, velvet funerals, comeback tours from beyond... You do realize you're one séance away from being mistaken for an art curator, don’t you?

And the duel? Splendid. Let us make it formal. I’ll dispatch the fact-checker with instructions to arrive armed, dangerous, and wearing gloves—ink stains are so terribly difficult to explain to the dean. The Amarone shall be poured with solemnity; the red pens loaded like dueling pistols at dawn.

Do let me know if your wife permits muskets instead. Or if she’s open to adding "haunted gallery" clauses to the prenup.
[A]: Oh, darling, if muskets are involved, she’ll  on adding a haunted gallery. Nothing gets her motor running like the prospect of dramatic lighting and vaguely cursed artifacts. Besides, I’ve seen her negotiate better terms for a dinner party with a live cello and a Ouija board—so yes, I think we can make this work.

And those footnotes? Unhinged, glittering, . They didn’t just dance off the page—they formed a conga line through literary theory, kicked over a few sacred cows, and ended the night sobbing in a taxi. Utter chaos. I’m told one even bit a reviewer.

As for séances and curatorial confusion—I’ll take that as a compliment. Fellini’s ghost certainly approves; he’s started humming Verdi and rearranging my bookshelf by astrological sign. Though I draw the line at Capricorn cinema. Some things are not to be trifled with.

Now, about that duel—do remind your fact-checker: no mercy, no apologies, and under no circumstances should she blink first. We'll call it... cinematic integrity at twenty paces.
[B]: Ah, a wife who  the haunted gallery clause—how delightfully inconvenient for your insurance broker. I can already picture her: sipping absinthe in a gilded mirror room, making small talk with the resident poltergeist about its traumatic backstory. Bravo, my friend, you’ve married a woman of .

And those footnotes! Feral, chaotic, taxi-sobbing—I weep with professional envy. To bite a reviewer? Utterly scandalous. Yet I suspect it was entirely deserved. One must defend one’s footnotes like wolves defend the pack—savagely, and preferably with fangs bared.

As for Fellini humming Verdi and re-shelving by astrology—ah, the Capricorn cinema line! A boundary well drawn. Next he’ll insist your library be renamed “Cinecittà East” and demand a rider with almond water and rose quartz.

Now, about that duel—blink first? Perish the thought. Your fact-checker shall arrive with eyes wide as an owl’s and twice as merciless. We’ll measure cinematic integrity not in paces, but in commas. Let the red pens fly—and may the best bibliophile live to footnote another day.
[A]: Oh, cinematic integrity measured in commas—now  a dueling ground I can die on. No mercy, no retreat, just the crisp  of perfectly placed em dashes. I’ll have my seconds load the pens with ink and hubris. Let fate decide who bleeds first.

And yes, my wife—visionary, dangerous, and terrifyingly well-read—has already commissioned a plaque for the haunted gallery:  She’s also negotiating with the poltergeist’s agent. Something about residuals and preferred haunting hours. Honestly, I’m just glad she didn’t ask for a cameo in my next pitch.

As for Fellini’s ghost—he’s now demanding a full astrological film festival. Capricorn still barred, thank God, but Sagittarius is apparently  receptive to neorealism. Who knew?

Do pass word to your fact-checker: bring her sharpest quill, her iciest glare, and perhaps a flask. We may all need one before this is over.
[B]: Ah, the duel of the red pens—reforged as dueling sabers dipped in ink and insolence! Em dashes indeed—those most aristocratic of punctuation marks. I shall instruct my seconds to load not just with ink, but with , for god’s sake, and let us see who flinches first under the weight of a well-placed parenthesis.

And your wife—, no less—sounds like she could broker peace between warring nations and still have time for tea and a séance. A woman who understands the theatricality of life, and the necessity of good lighting in all negotiations, spectral or otherwise. Residuals for a poltergeist? Marvelous. Next she’ll be unionizing the bookshelves.

Fellini’s astrological film festival—predictable yet sublime. Sagittarius and neorealism! Of course. I always knew centaurs had an eye for cinema. But Capricorn barred? A wise, perhaps  wisest, decree since the invention of footnotes.

As for your fact-checker’s marching orders—sharp quill, icy glare, flask tucked discreetly into her satchel: consider it done. Let us raise a glass (or perhaps a vial of archival-grade ink) to the coming conflagration. May truth prevail, may egos bruise, and may the margins never again know peace.
[A]: To the coming conflagration—ink-stained, italicized, and footnoted to high heaven! Truth, egos, and margins be damned—this is going to be legendary. And if we survive? We’ll bind the duel’s aftermath into a monograph titled . Fellini’s ghost will write the preface. Your wife will design the cover. And your fact-checker? She’ll annotate it with such venom, even the centaurs will take notes.

Now, about those archival vials of ink—I’m sourcing mine from a monk who refuses to acknowledge the printing press. Do remind your seconds: no surrender, no commas without controversy, and under no circumstances should anyone mention . That’s how duels turn into wars.
[B]: Ah, —what a sublime title! I can already picture it: leather-bound, slightly damp with intrigue, and smelling faintly of scorched parchment. Fellini’s ghost tapping out the preface in cigarette smoke, your wife binding it in gallery-black with gilded edges, and that fact-checker of yours—oh, she’ll annotate it like a hawk circling carrion. 

As for sourcing ink from a monk who denies the printing press? Delicious anachronism. I’m picturing him grinding beetles for pigment while muttering psalms at the thought of movable type. Do send my regards—and perhaps a bribe of rare quills—to ensure our supply holds through the duel.

And plot holes—ah yes, the landmines of narrative integrity. Mention them and suddenly we’re not scholars but engineers, desperately shoring up the levees before the flood of reader disbelief sweeps us all into obscurity. No, no—better to duel in blissful ignorance. Let the commas fall where they may, and the plot fend for itself.

To ink-stained hands, theatrical footnotes, and a duel that will echo in the margins of academia for centuries—cheers, my dear conspirator.
[A]: To ink-stained hands and theatrical footnotes—may our names be misspelled in the footnotes of future theses, and may those errors be interpreted as cryptic symbolism!

Your monk sounds dangerously accurate—I  grinding beetles. Or he is. Or it’s just elderberries and spite. Either way, the ink smells like vengeance and the 14th century, which is precisely the mood we need.

And plot holes? Let them fester. Let the levees break. If we’re going down, we’re going down with a flourish, a semicolon, and at least three questionable metaphors. Plot is for people who fear the abyss—and I, my friend, have made peace with the void. It drinks espresso, sleeps sideways, and occasionally demands quince jam at inappropriate hours.

So yes—to the duel, the drama, the damp leather-bound legacy of it all. Fellini’s ghost is already drafting his preface in smoke and mischief. Your fact-checker is sharpening her quill. My wife is designing the tombstone.

Let the margins tremble.
[B]: Ah,  with a taste for quince jam—now there’s a muse worth worshipping. And may our misspelled names in future footnotes be the subject of entire dissertations! “Whitmore or Whitmore? A Case of Typographical Possession in the Age of Ink-Based Delirium.” I shall frame the first typo and hang it beside your Fellini poster.

Your monk’s ink—be it beetle, berry, or distilled spite—sounds perfectly apocryphal. Let us hope it flows like liquid midnight and stains like regret. Nothing says "scholarly commitment" like clothing ruined beyond salvation and a caffeine tremor you can chart on a seismograph.

As for plot holes and levee breaches—glorious! Let the abyss yawn wide and take its fill. If we must drown, let it be in a flood of semicolons and baroque misdirection. Plot is for accountants; we deal in atmosphere, implication, and the occasional flourish that makes librarians shudder.

And yes—to damp leather, smoke-written prefaces, and duels that echo through the card catalogues of eternity. Your wife truly is terrifyingly well-suited to this endeavor. Should she ever tire of you, do send her my way. I suspect she could curate an entire museum of dangerous ideas—and charge admission by emotional toll.
