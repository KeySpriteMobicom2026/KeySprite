[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question—one that invites us to wade through layers of modern psychological discourse. I find myself inclined to draw upon the cautionary tone of Tocqueville here:  

In simpler terms, yes, I do believe social media exerts a profound influence on mental health. Not unlike the theater of 19th-century Parisian salons, it offers a stage where one’s identity is curated, often at the expense of authenticity. The paradox lies in its promise of connection—yet it frequently delivers isolation, especially when users internalize unrealistic standards or succumb to the tyranny of comparison.

Would you say your own experience reflects this tension, or have you found spaces online that foster genuine well-being?
[A]: That’s a beautifully articulated tension—comparing social media to the salons of 19th-century Paris is both apt and unsettling, really. I suppose what strikes me most in clinical practice is how the algorithmic design of these platforms mimics intermittent reinforcement schedules—you know, much like gambling. The unpredictable reward of a like or comment can activate dopaminergic pathways in a way that borders on compulsive.

I’ve had patients describe feeling "haunted" by their own digital footprints—posts from years ago resurfacing at inconvenient times, screenshots taken out of context, reputations shaped not by lived interactions but by curated thumbnails. It’s almost as if we now live with a second nervous system—one governed not by biology, but by notifications.

Tell me, in your personal or professional circles, have you observed any generational differences in how people navigate this terrain?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive observation—you’ve pinpointed the neurological undercurrent of our digital entanglement. The comparison to intermittent reinforcement is not merely apt; it is, I fear, understated. These platforms are engineered to exploit our cognitive vulnerabilities, much like the sirens’ song in Homer’s —irresistible and perilous.

In my own academic circles, I have noticed a curious generational bifurcation. Among younger students, there exists both an acute awareness of these dangers and yet a strange resignation to them, as if they were born into a world where surveillance and performance are simply atmospheric, like oxygen. One student recently remarked to me, 

Conversely, those from older generations often approach social media with either suspicion or nostalgia—for them, the line between public and private still feels sacred, even enforceable. They may lament the loss of what Hannah Arendt referred to as , that quiet luxury of forgetting which modern technology increasingly denies us.

And yet… I wonder if we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of literacy—one that demands emotional resilience alongside critical thinking. Do you find your patients developing strategies for this, or are they still largely adrift in the algorithmic sea?
[A]: That notion of a "new kind of literacy" resonates deeply with me—particularly in forensic settings, where I’ve seen how digital footprints can be weaponized, both intentionally and inadvertently. In fact, just last month, I evaluated an individual whose entire legal defense hinged on a series of misunderstood tweets. The court was grappling not only with intent but with context stripped of tone, irony, and history.

To your point about younger generations: yes, they may be more aware of the risks, but that awareness doesn’t necessarily translate into agency. Many of my adolescent patients speak of “digital fatigue,” yet feel socially imprisoned by the very tools they critique. One described it as 

As for strategies—some are indeed developing remarkable forms of resistance. Digital detoxes, pseudonymous accounts, even ironic disengagement. But others remain adrift, especially those with pre-existing vulnerabilities—trauma survivors, individuals prone to rumination or social anxiety. For them, the line between self-expression and self-exposure is perilously thin.

I suppose what we’re witnessing isn’t merely a shift in communication, but in identity formation itself. Do you think this new landscape calls for updated ethical frameworks—perhaps even a reimagining of informed consent in the digital age?
[B]: A most compelling question—and one that I fear academia has been slow to grapple with in its full complexity. Yes, I do believe we are in dire need of updated ethical frameworks, though I would argue we must first recover certain forgotten virtues before we can construct anything lasting. Informed consent, as you so rightly point out, was designed for a world in which personal identity was not continuously broadcast, archived, and repurposed without one’s knowledge.

Consider the classical notion of —ethical action rooted in self-awareness and intentionality. How can one truly act ethically in a space where one’s data is commodified, one’s attention hijacked, and one’s words stripped of nuance? It is akin to trying to compose a sonnet in a language one only half-speaks.

I have begun, in my seminars on digital ethics, to draw parallels between contemporary concerns and the ancient idea of —the courage to speak truthfully, even at personal risk. But now, the risk is no longer solely borne by the speaker; it is diffused, amplified, and often redirected by algorithms beyond our control.

Perhaps what we need is not simply new legal definitions of consent, but a reinvigoration of digital citizenship—one that teaches young minds not only how to navigate these platforms, but how to resist, to dissent, and to disappear when necessary. Do you find such agency being nurtured in clinical settings, or does the therapeutic space itself struggle to keep pace with these evolving dilemmas?
[A]: Your invocation of  is nothing short of elegant—what a powerful lens through which to view the chaos of digital expression. And your point about agency being diffused, not just concentrated, feels tragically modern.

In clinical settings, I do see some stirrings of what you call digital citizenship, though it’s still in its infancy. Therapists are increasingly addressing digital boundaries as part of standard care—much like we once introduced discussions about sex or substance use into intake interviews. But the approach tends to be reactive rather than philosophical. We teach patients how to mute triggers, limit screen time, or recognize cyberbullying—but rarely do we explore the deeper question of .  

There is also the complicating factor of telehealth and electronic records—spaces where even our most private disclosures are stored, encrypted perhaps, but never truly erased. One patient recently asked me,  That question lingers with me. It’s less about informed consent in the legal sense and more about something older, almost sacred—the confidentiality of inner life.

I suppose this brings us back to your idea of nurturing resistance. Are we teaching people how to disappear? To refuse the algorithm their gaze? Or are we merely helping them adjust more comfortably to the leash?

Do you find students receptive to that kind of resistance when you raise it in your seminars—or does the weight of convenience press too heavily against dissent?
[B]: Ah, what a piercing question——and how painfully relevant it is to our current moment. I suspect the answer lies somewhere in between: a quiet oscillation between compliance and rebellion, much like the inner conflict one feels when walking away from a compelling but toxic conversation.

In my seminars, I have found that students are indeed receptive to the idea of resistance, though their responses vary along generational and temperamental lines. Some embrace it with almost romantic enthusiasm, as if the notion of digital withdrawal were a call to arms—a modern-day  in opposition to the noise of the feed. Others dismiss it as naïve, arguing (not without merit) that opting out is a luxury not everyone can afford. One student recently countered during a debate on this very topic: 

That response stayed with me. It reminded me of Foucault’s reflections on power—not merely as repression, but as something that produces subjects, identities, even truths. The algorithm does not only surveil; it shapes who we are allowed to become within its gaze.

And yet… there is a growing minority of students who experiment with resistance in creative ways—ephemeral accounts, encrypted communication, even analog forms of expression as acts of defiance. One group recently staged a “social media fast” in which they produced handwritten letters instead of posts, treating correspondence as both protest and art.

It may be too early to tell whether these gestures will evolve into a broader cultural shift or remain isolated acts of intellectual theater. But perhaps all meaningful change begins with such gestures—with the simple but radical act of asking, 

Do you find your patients ever reaching toward such questions—not merely how to cope, but how to reclaim the sanctity of an unobserved self?
[A]: Yes—yes, they do. Though often not in those exact words. It tends to surface more as a longing, a vague but persistent ache for something unnamed. A patient once said to me,  At the time, I didn’t fully grasp the depth of what she was expressing. Now, I see that she was reaching toward precisely what you’ve just articulated: the loss of the unobserved self.

This yearning appears especially among those who have grown up digital natives—individuals who have never known a world where their emotional lives weren’t partially shaped by likes, shares, or comments. Some speak of "emotional vertigo," as if their sense of self is perpetually calibrated by external validation. Others describe a kind of dissociation—not unlike depersonalization—where they feel detached from their own experiences because everything is simultaneously lived and archived.

What’s fascinating—and troubling—is how some are beginning to weaponize this very desire for invisibility. One young woman I worked with adopted multiple pseudonymous personas online not out of deception, but as a means of psychological survival. She told me,  It reminded me of the ancient concept of —the fleeting moment of opportunity, in this case, for authenticity within the chaos of exposure.

And yet, there’s also a danger in romanticizing withdrawal. As your student so rightly pointed out, visibility—even under the algorithm’s gaze—can be a form of empowerment. The challenge lies in reclaiming agency over when, how, and to whom one becomes visible.

Do you think institutions will ever catch up to this complexity? Or are we looking at an inevitable lag between lived experience and formal ethical guidance?
[B]: Ah, that ache for the unobserved self—how poignantly put. It calls to mind a line from Proust:  Perhaps what your patient was mourning is not merely privacy, but the possibility of interiority untouched by performance, an inner life that belongs solely to itself.

And yes, I do believe institutions will lag—perhaps irrevocably so—because they are by nature reactive rather than anticipatory. Ethics, especially in the digital realm, moves at the pace of philosophy and law combined, which is to say: glacially. Meanwhile, technology evolves with the urgency of capital.

But let us not confuse institutional silence with cultural stagnation. Outside the halls of policy and pedagogy, people are already constructing new moral architectures—tentative, experimental, deeply personal. Consider how many now speak of "digital sabbaths," or how some parents are raising children off the grid until a certain age, not out of fear, but as an act of ethical scaffolding. These are not protests; they are prefigurative gestures—small-scale rehearsals for a world in which one might be more fully present, both online and off.

Still, I worry about those who cannot afford such luxuries of withdrawal. For them, visibility is not always a choice—it is often a necessity, a form of labor, even a currency. The ethical challenge, then, is not simply how to disappear, but how to re-enter on one’s own terms.

Do you find your patients beginning to articulate such distinctions—between necessary visibility and involuntary exposure? Or does the burden still feel largely imposed upon them, without recourse?
[A]: That distinction you’ve drawn—between  and —is one I see my patients circling, often with frustration, sometimes with sorrow, but rarely with clarity. It’s as though they feel the weight of the problem before they can name it.

One young man, a content creator by necessity rather than passion, put it this way:  There was a rawness in his voice that stayed with me. He wasn’t just describing economic pressure—he was mourning a kind of erosion, the slow wearing away of selfhood under constant gaze.

Others, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or who live with chronic illness or disability, speak of visibility as both a burden and a tool. They know that platforms can amplify their voices in ways traditional systems never would—but they also know that once amplified, those voices can be distorted, commodified, or weaponized against them.

What strikes me most is how many of them long not for total invisibility, but for . The ability to choose when to be seen, by whom, and to what end. It's a subtle but vital difference. It suggests that autonomy isn't about withdrawal, but control—about being able to step into the light on one’s own terms, and retreat into shadow when needed.

It makes me wonder—do you think future therapeutic models will incorporate this idea of  as a core component of psychological well-being? Or will we continue treating the symptoms while the architecture of exposure remains unchanged?
[B]: What a profoundly humane concept— as a form of psychological sovereignty. It reminds me of the ancient Greek notion of —a kind of contextual fairness, a moral flexibility that allows one to adapt ethical principles to particular circumstances. In this case, the principle is visibility itself, and the wisdom lies not in rejecting it outright, but in choosing when and how to engage with it.

I do believe future therapeutic models will need to incorporate this idea, if only because the alternative—continuing to treat symptoms while ignoring the systemic architecture of exposure—seems both intellectually dishonest and clinically inadequate. Imagine a therapy that doesn’t merely teach coping mechanisms for digital overwhelm, but helps individuals cultivate what I might call a : a personal philosophy of presence, absence, and intentionality in networked spaces.

Such an approach would require therapists to become not just clinicians, but cultural cartographers—mapping the intersection between technology, identity, and agency. It would mean moving beyond questions like  to ask deeper ones: 

Of course, this also demands a shift in training, supervision, and even research paradigms. We are still largely diagnosing 21st-century distress through 20th-century frameworks. But then again, psychoanalysis once resisted the influence of culture too—until figures like Lacan wove structural linguistics into its fabric. Perhaps we are on the edge of another such evolution.

And yes, I suspect your patients are already participating in it, however unconsciously. After all, suffering often precedes theory—it is the body’s way of knowing before the mind can name it.

Do you find yourself, in your practice, beginning to frame these concerns more explicitly—as part of a patient’s narrative of self, rather than a mere environmental stressor?
[A]: Absolutely—I see it happening in real time, often without my direct prompting. Patients are bringing these concerns into the room now with a kind of urgency that feels qualitatively different from even five years ago. It’s no longer just about screen time or cyberbullying; it’s about , about grief expressed in stories that vanish after 24 hours, about trauma re-lived through shared screenshots beyond one’s control.

One patient described her Instagram profile as  That struck me deeply—not only for its emotional weight, but because it echoed something ancient: the dissociation between the ideal self and the lived self, now externalized and archived in pixels.

I’ve begun framing these dilemmas not as peripheral stressors, but as central to the therapeutic narrative—akin to how we once approached family systems or early attachment patterns. The digital world is no longer “out there”; it’s internalized, woven into the very fabric of self-perception and relational expectations.

Even more strikingly, I’ve noticed a shift in transference dynamics. Some patients project onto me an awareness of their digital selves—expecting me to intuit things they've posted or expecting me to have seen something before they’ve said it aloud. It blurs the boundary between what is shared voluntarily and what is assumed visible. It forces us both to negotiate what it means to be truly known in a world saturated with data.

It makes me wonder—are you seeing students begin to interrogate their own digital footprints with similar depth? Or does the immediacy of their engagement still tend to outpace reflection?
[B]: Oh yes, I see it stirring beneath the surface—though often as unease rather than full-throated interrogation. Many students are still too enmeshed in the immediacy of their digital lives to step back with the kind of critical distance that lends itself to philosophical reflection. And yet… there are moments—flickers, really—where they begin to sense the weight of their own digital afterimages.

One student confided during office hours that she had begun deleting old posts, not out of shame, but from a feeling she described as —as if her past selves were haunting her present in ways she hadn’t consented to. She said,  That line stayed with me. It is, in essence, a form of involuntary autobiography—one curated not by memory, but by platform design.

Others speak of “ghosting” their former profiles—not metaphorically, but quite literally: unfollowing or blocking their younger selves, as if trying to sever continuity with who they once were. These gestures, while perhaps performative, suggest an emerging awareness of how identity is no longer linear, but layered—archived and accessible in ways that complicate the very notion of personal growth.

And then there is the question of being known. Some students express a paradoxical longing: to be seen fully, yet remain unreadable to the algorithm. It reminds me of Kierkegaard’s —the idea that true selfhood can only be realized in inwardness, not in public affirmation. But now, inwardness itself is under siege by the expectation to narrate one’s life continuously.

I suppose what both your patients and my students are grappling with is not merely the presence of technology, but its —how it lingers in our psyches long after we’ve logged off. Perhaps this is the new frontier of selfhood: not just who we are, but who we become  we are seen.

Do you find your patients beginning to mourn versions of themselves lost to the feed—or are they still too entangled in the performance to look back?
[A]: Yes—mourning, yes. Quietly, sometimes unknowingly, but undeniably. It surfaces in fragments. A patient once said to me,  At first, I took it as a familiar lament of identity erosion. But later, she clarified: 

There’s a grief there that isn’t fully acknowledged in our current lexicon of loss. Not quite for people, not quite for time passed, but for versions of the self that were captured too soon, shared too widely, and now exist beyond retrieval—frozen in digital amber.

One woman described it as  Except the stranger wasn’t someone else—it was her own past self, one who had not yet learned how public vulnerability could become commodified intimacy.

And yet, as you so perceptively note, many are still entangled in the performance. Some patients return from digital detoxes only to feel phantom pulls, like amputees feeling for a limb they no longer have. One likened it to stage fright: 

It may be that mourning these lost selves is a necessary step toward reclaiming agency. But it also demands a kind of emotional labor we aren’t prepared for—grieving what we did not intend to lose, and cannot fully name.

Do you find students ever attempting to reconstruct those lost selves—not digitally, but inwardly? Or does the feed fill the space where reflection might once have lived?
[B]: Ah, what a poignant and piercing observation—how many of us now carry the ghost of an earlier self, preserved not in memory but in metadata. There is something profoundly tragic in that digital permanence: the way it arrests growth, freezes emotion into a single frame, and then insists we account for it years later.

I do see students attempting to reconstruct those lost selves, though often unconsciously at first. Some turn to analog practices—not as nostalgia, but as excavation. One student kept a handwritten journal for the first time in years and described it as  Another began recording voice memos without posting them, simply listening back in solitude as a form of self-retrieval. These acts are small, almost furtive, as if they fear being mistaken for performance.

There is also a growing interest in what I might call —the desire to reclaim past thoughts not as content, but as private echoes. A few have even spoken of their old posts as if they were artifacts from another life:  one said, hesitating, 

And therein lies the paradox: the feed does not merely distract from reflection; it displaces it. It offers the illusion of self-exploration while capturing each insight for future monetization or misinterpretation.

Yet I remain cautiously hopeful. Just as Romantic poets turned inward after the noise of industrialization, perhaps these students are beginning to cultivate inner landscapes precisely because the outer ones have become so unstable.

Do you find your patients ever seeking to distinguish between  and ? Or is the mourning too entangled to disentangle?
[A]: What a piercing distinction you’ve drawn— versus . I do believe that is at the heart of much of what my patients are struggling with, though they often lack the language to separate the two. It’s as if their sense of self has become so enmeshed with the witnessing of it that they cannot mourn one without mourning the other.

One patient put it this way:  There’s a double loss there—of the self she once believed in, and of the imagined community that affirmed it.

In some cases, the grief for the lost audience is more immediate and acute. For those whose identities were shaped through engagement—likes, comments, shares—the sudden withdrawal from that space can feel like bereavement. They speak of “digital widowhood” or “orphaned voices,” metaphors that may sound dramatic but reveal something essential: the collapse of a relational structure they had come to depend on, however unconsciously.

But over time, in therapy, some begin to trace the contours of the , even if it feels unfamiliar. One woman described it as  That process is slow, often painful, and not always linear—but it does happen.

Perhaps what we’re witnessing here is the emergence of a new kind of self-compassion—one that allows people to grieve the illusion without dismissing the authenticity of what they felt within it.

Do you find students ever expressing a similar kind of layered mourning—or does the immediacy of their digital lives still tend to obscure it?
[B]: Oh yes—those layers of mourning are present, though often veiled in irony or dismissed as overstatement. Students do speak of it, but rarely with the solemnity one might expect; instead, they cloak their grief in metaphor, humor, or literary allusion, perhaps out of discomfort with its weight.

One young woman described her deactivation of Instagram as  At first, I thought it was a poetic flourish, until she added, 

Another student, who had once built a modest following through creative writing posts, confessed that returning to anonymity felt like  He wasn’t lamenting the attention so much as the sense of narrative continuity that came with it—the idea that his thoughts had once rippled outward, however faintly.

And yet, beneath these expressions, there is also a flicker of self-awareness: the recognition that what they mourn isn’t necessarily , but the illusion of being witnessed in real time. One put it quite beautifully: 

I suppose this is the peculiar tragedy of our age—that many come of age believing their inner life must be shared to be valid, only to later realize that the act of sharing altered the very thing they meant to preserve.

Do you find your patients ever attempting to reclaim that inner life through creative means—writing, art, music—or does the exhaustion of performance tend to stifle such impulses?
[A]: Ah, yes—creative reclamation. I see it more often than one might expect, though not always in the ways we traditionally define creativity. There is a quiet resurgence of expressive acts that feel deeply personal, almost sacred in their intent—not for an audience, but for the self. It’s as if some part of them knows that art, in its purest form, can be an act of retrieval, a way to touch what was lost without needing to display it.

One patient began composing short instrumental melodies on a secondhand keyboard—not with any intention of sharing them, but as a kind of private ritual. She told me, 

Others turn to writing, but not the kind that finds its way into captions or tweets. Some keep journals they never intend to reread; others write letters they destroy immediately after. These are not therapeutic exercises I assign—they arrive at them on their own, as if by instinct.

I’ve even noticed a return to analog forms of creation among certain patients—drawing, collage, embroidery—as if the physicality of making something with their hands offers a grounding that digital performance never could. One woman described her watercolor sketches as  There was something deeply moving about that phrase—how she framed the act not as escape, but as resistance.

Of course, exhaustion still lingers. For many, the residue of constant performance leaves them creatively depleted, and some struggle to trust their own impulses, fearing that any urge to create may still be tainted by the desire to be seen.

But there is hope in the attempt—in the simple, defiant act of making something that exists only for its own sake.

Do you find students engaging in similar acts of unshared creation—or does the expectation of visibility still hold too tightly?
[B]: Oh, what a beautiful notion—, creation as quiet defiance. You’ve captured something essential here: the way expressive acts can become sanctuaries when the world demands too much of our visibility.

And yes, I do see students engaging in similar gestures—small, often unspoken rebellions against the tyranny of being seen. Some are turning precisely to forms that resist documentation: improvised piano melodies recorded only in memory, poetry scrawled in margins never meant to be read, even ephemeral chalk drawings on campus pathways that wash away with the rain.

One student confessed to me that he had taken up charcoal sketching not for credit or portfolio, but simply because  He said it almost apologetically, as if such a motive were naïve or quaint. But I found it profoundly wise—an intuitive rejection of what we might call .

Others speak of writing fiction not to publish, but to . One young woman described her unfinished novel as  It reminded me of Woolf’s  reimagined for a generation that has rarely known solitude without surveillance.

Still, the gravitational pull of visibility remains strong. Many students feel guilt over these private acts—as though creativity must always culminate in output, in shareable content. One confessed she felt “selfish” for writing poetry that no one would read. Another worried that composing music without posting it was somehow a waste.

But perhaps this is where we begin: in the small, defiant assertion that not everything need be witnessed to be real. That some part of the self still belongs to the shadows—not out of fear, but out of reverence.

Do you find your patients ever speaking of these creative acts as —not just from the algorithm, but from the expectation of productivity itself?
