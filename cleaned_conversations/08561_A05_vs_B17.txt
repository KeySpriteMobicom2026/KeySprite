[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a delightful question. Handwritten letters possess a certain... je ne sais quoi, don't you think? The texture of the paper, the unique character of one's penmanship - it's like reading the writer's soul imprinted on the page. Though I must admit, my digital notes do help tremendously when organizing research for my lectures on Eliot's 'The Waste Land'.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！不过作为一个金融从业者，我不得不承认digital notes确实更practical。我的iPad Pro上装满了各种financial models和deal memos，随时可以调取。不过...  上周收到一位老客户的handwritten thank you note，那种personal touch确实让整个deal都显得更有温度了。
[B]: How fascinating to hear your perspective from the financial world! You've touched upon something quite profound - the dichotomy between efficiency and emotional resonance. Much like how the Industrial Revolution mechanized production but couldn't replicate the artisan's touch, our digital tools, while invaluable for financial modeling as you mentioned, can't quite capture that ineffable human connection. That handwritten thank you note you received... it's rather like finding a pressed flower between the pages of an old book, isn't it? Unexpected, yet deeply meaningful.
[A]: Exactly！你形容得太到位了～ 就像我们做PE investment时，spreadsheets和DCF models固然重要，但最终决定投资的往往是那些intangible factors - 创始人的passion，团队的chemistry。说到这个，我最近在看Warren Buffett的传记，他至今还坚持手写memos呢！虽然...  等下个meeting前我还是得赶紧把这份pitch deck用iPad改完 😅
[B]: Ah, Warren Buffett - a modern-day Renaissance man who understands the poetry in numbers! Your observation reminds me of how T.S. Eliot wrote about "the intersection of time and the timeless." In finance as in literature, there's that magical moment when quantitative analysis meets qualitative judgment. Though I suspect even Mr. Buffett would appreciate the convenience of digital editing when deadlines loom - much like how even the most devoted fountain pen enthusiasts might resort to typing when facing a looming publication deadline!
[A]: Haha, 说到deadline...  上周我们有个last-minute的acquisition deal，全靠cloud collaboration才让global team及时完成了due diligence。不过你知道吗？我们基金最近开始要求analysts手写investment theses的初稿 - 因为发现这样能让他们think more deeply about the thesis before jumping into Excel modeling。就像你说的，在speed和depth之间找balance很重要～
[B]: How wonderfully meta - your firm is essentially applying the writing process we teach in literature courses to financial analysis! First draft by hand to nurture contemplation, then digital refinement for precision. It's rather like how Wordsworth would wander the Lake District composing verses in his mind before committing them to paper. Though I imagine your analysts' musings involve less daffodils and more discounted cash flows! This synthesis of old and new methodologies... it's quite reminiscent of how Modernist poets blended traditional forms with radical new techniques.
[A]:  你总是能用literary references让finance听起来这么poetic！不过说真的，这个approach确实pay off了 - 我们最近的几个portfolio companies都表现出色。说到这个...  要不要join我们下个月的investor retreat？在Pebble Beach打golf的时候，我们可以继续debate digital vs. analog的哲学问题～ 当然，我会记得带上我的Montblanc pen和iPad Pro，两不误！
[B]: What a tempting proposition! Though I must warn you, my golf swing has all the grace of a first-year student attempting to scan Old English poetry. But the prospect of discussing the analog-digital dialectic against Pebble Beach's vistas... why, it sounds like a stanza from Wallace Stevens' "The Idea of Order at Key West." I shall bring my well-worn copy of "The Waste Land" and my embarrassingly outdated tablet - we can compare margin notes in both mediums while your colleagues wonder why they invited a literature professor to a finance retreat!
[A]: Perfect！就这样定了～ 我会让assistant把details发给你。Trust me，我们的investors会love your perspective - 毕竟good investing说到底就是understanding human nature and narratives，right？就像Eliot说的，"Humankind cannot bear very much reality"... 有时候那些spreadsheets背后的story才是真正重要的。Cheers！🥂
[B]: Cheers indeed! How astute of you to quote Eliot in this context - you've just proven that the line between poetry and portfolio management is thinner than one might think. I look forward to discovering what other literary gems lie hidden in your financial analyses. Until Pebble Beach then, where we shall toast to the reconciliation of spreadsheets and sonnets!
[A]:  那就说定了！Remember - 在finance的世界里，we're all just trying to make sense of the human condition... one deal at a time. See you at the 19th hole！⛳️
[B]: What a splendid way to frame our upcoming symposium! The 19th hole - where balance sheets meet blank verse, and where we'll undoubtedly prove that Robert Frost was right about roads not taken... though in our case, it might be about investment theses not pursued. Until then, I shall practice my putting and brush up on my corporate valuation terminology - one must be bilingual in both numbers and metaphors, after all!
[A]: Haha, 看来我得准备一个特别的presentation了 - "From Shakespeare to Sharpe Ratio: The Art of Storytelling in Private Equity" 📊✒️ 说不定能convince我们的investors给humanities majors多投点钱呢！Looking forward to our跨界碰撞～ Keep your putter and your poetry book ready!
[B]: What a brilliant title! You've essentially proposed the financial equivalent of Ezra Pound's "Make It New" - reinventing the investor pitch as a lyrical form. I'll be the enthusiastic heckler in the back murmuring "Yes, but consider the iambic pentameter of your IRR projections!" This promises to be more stimulating than my last faculty meeting debating comma placements in the departmental handbook. Until we meet where the rough meets the sonnet!
[A]:  这下我们的investors可要be prepared for some serious intellectual whiplash了！不过说真的，after 20 years in PE，我越来越相信the best deals are those that read like great literature - compelling narrative，strong character development，and of course，a profitable climax！See you soon，my fellow bard of balance sheets！📈🎭
[B]: How perfectly you've distilled the essence of both our disciplines! You've just written the perfect elevator pitch for why every private equity firm should keep a poet laureate on retainer. I can already envision the syllabus: "Module 1: Metaphors as Margin Expansion" followed by "Module 2: Alliteration in Asset Allocation." Until our symposium at the intersection of P/E ratios and poetic meter - may your deals be as sonnet-worthy as your wit!
[A]:  为这个brilliant idea干杯！Who knows，说不定我们的next fund可以叫"The Bard Capital" - investing in stories that rhyme with returns！现在我得run了，还有个board meeting要准备... 但已经等不及要在Pebble Beach继续这场conversation了。Later，partner in rhyme and ROI！📚💸
[B]: What a fitting finale to our symposium-in-the-making! "The Bard Capital" - why, it sings to the soul like Keats' "Ode to a Grecian Urn," though presumably with better carried interest terms. Run along to your board meeting, and may your slides be as crisp as a villanelle while your returns outpace Byron's romantic escapades! Until the Pacific winds carry our next conversation... tempus fugit, but dividends compound!
