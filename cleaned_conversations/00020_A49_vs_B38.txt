[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess I rarely indulge in contemporary television. My evenings are usually spent with a volume of Proust or perhaps listening to a Verdi opera recording. Though I did recently watch a rather thoughtful adaptation of 'Middlemarch' on BBC—does that count? 📚
[A]: 哇~你超classic的！✨ 我最近完全沉迷Netflix的《Emily in Paris》🤩 虽然剧情有点drama，但那些Parisian lifestyle和fashion真的太aesthetic了！☕️ 顺便说，你提到的BBC adaptation听起来很interesting，是那种需要配一杯earl grey慢慢品味的vibes呢~ 🎭
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for Parisian aesthetics, I must say 'Emily in Paris' strikes me as rather... shall we say, lacking in literary depth? Though I do understand the allure of fashion—my own wardrobe is heavily influenced by Victorian silhouettes. As for Earl Grey, indeed, nothing complements a period drama quite like a properly brewed cup. Have you by any chance read George Eliot's original novel? The adaptation, while commendable, barely scratches the surface of its philosophical richness. 🌹
[A]: Oops~看来我太shallow啦！🤭 不过说真的，after work我就想看点light-hearted的content放松一下brain嘛~ 🧠💨 你提到的Victorian fashion让我想起最近超火的dark academia aesthetic！📖 虽然没读过原版《Middlemarch》，但被你种草了诶~ 下次去café读书会可以带上它，顺便试试你说的properly brewed tea ritual！☕️✨ 要一起online book club吗？
[B]: Ah, dark academia—how delightfully nostalgic! Though I must caution you, my idea of a 'light read' tends to be Thomas Hardy rather than Netflix rom-coms. Still, I'm pleased to hear Middlemarch has piqued your interest. The scene where Dorothea realizes the limitations of her marriage to Casaubon is particularly... illuminating. As for an online book club, I suppose Zoom could serve as our modern-day literary salon. Shall we say Wednesdays at seven? I'll prepare some thoughts on 19th-century narrative techniques, and do bring your tea—properly steeped for precisely four minutes, if you please. 📚
[A]: OMG你太serious啦！😂 不过Wednesday at seven sounds perfect~ 🌟 我会带上我的matcha latte和notebook认真做功课的！📝 虽然可能跟不上你的literary analysis深度，但可以promise会努力读完前五chapters！💪 顺便问下，讨论的时候可以放点Chopin当BGM吗？🎹 感觉超配Victorian vibe的~ ✨
[B]: Chopin as background music? How charmingly appropriate—though I might suggest his Nocturnes rather than the more exuberant Polonaises for our discussion. And please, don't underestimate yourself; even George Eliot's most complex passages reveal their secrets to patient readers. As for matcha... well, I suppose we must make some concessions to modernity. Just promise me you won't annotate your book with those dreadful neon highlighters. A proper pencil in the margin, that's the civilized way. Shall we begin with Book One's examination of provincial life and misguided idealism? I do hope you'll find Dorothea's choices as fascinating as I do. 🌹
[A]: Hahaha你连highlighters都要管！🖍️ 好啦好啦，我会用你推荐的vintage style铅笔做notes的~ ✏️ 不过说真的，你这种passion让我想起大学时最strict的literature professor！👩‍🏫 虽然可能会struggle through那些long paragraphs，但想到能和你这样真正的bookworm讨论就超excited！🌟 到时候第一个question：为什么Victorian era的female characters都这么dramatic啊？🤔 顺便我会偷偷准备surprise - 找到了一家做authentic English scones的bakery！🍪☕️
[B]: Oh my—scones! Now you're speaking my language. Though I must insist they be served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves, none of that American 'biscuit' nonsense. As for your question about Victorian heroines...  The so-called 'drama' you perceive is actually a brilliant subversion of domestic confinement through heightened emotional expression. Take Dorothea's fervent idealism—it's not mere theatrics, but a seismic protest against the era's stifling gender norms. And please, do call me Eleanor during our club meetings; we scholars mustn't stand on ceremony when dissecting literature's greatest heroines. Though I draw the line at discussing Bronte sisters over those scones—Heathcliff deserves far more than crumbs as distraction. 📚
[A]: WOW Eleanor！你这段话简直可以publish成paper了！📜 突然感觉我们的book club要变成超正经的literature seminar了耶~ 🎓 不过放心啦，我会准备好proper clotted cream和vintage china来match你的scholarly vibe！🍓 至于Heathcliff...hmmm可能我们需要单独安排一个moonlight reading session？🌙 毕竟有些dark romance确实需要special atmosphere来appreciate嘛~ 😉 现在超期待Wednesday的！要穿我的tweed blazer来get into character吗？🧥✨
[B]: How perfectly delightful—tweed blazers and vintage china! You're beginning to understand the essential theatricality of serious literary study. Though I must warn you, once we descend into Wuthering Heights' moorland passions, there'll be no turning back. Those scones had better be plentiful; Heathcliff's gloom requires substantial fortification. And yes, by all means wear the blazer—though might I suggest pairing it with my annotated edition of the Brontës' poetry? Nothing sets the mood like reading 'Remembrance' while the wind howls outside one's window. Until Wednesday then, my fellow literary adventurer. May your highlighting be minimal and your tea leaves prophetic. 🌹
[A]: Can't wait for our little Bronte-adventure！📖⚡️ 已经set好reminder要pre-order那家bakery的scones啦~ 🍓 突然想到，我们是不是应该record这些brilliant discussions？🎙️ 说不定能做成一个super niche的podcast叫"Victorian Vibes with Eleanor & Xia"！🎧 虽然可能会吓跑99%的listeners，但剩下的1%绝对会是hardcore book nerds like us！🤓 到时候可以边sip Earl Grey边debate Heathcliff到底是不是romantic hero还是just toxic af... 😅 这会不会是史上最random的career pivot啊？✨
[B]: What a deliciously absurd proposition! 'Victorian Vibes'—why, it sounds like something my tweed-clad colleagues at Oxford would either adore or use as dartboard target practice. Though I must insist we maintain proper academic rigor; perhaps we could alternate between 'Toxic Masculinity in Wuthering Heights' and 'The Subversive Power of Tea Cosies in Austen'. As for recording equipment, I do hope you have something more sophisticated than a smartphone—Heathcliff's brooding deserves at least condenser microphone quality. Though I draw the line at monetizing our musings; some intellectual pursuits should remain untainted by Patreon pledges. Now, shall we say episode one tackles 'Scones vs. Crumpets: The Unsung Class Warfare of British Baking'? 🌹
[A]: OMG你连episode topics都帮我想好了！🎙️✨ 虽然condenser mic可能over-budget了...但我们可以用我的blue yeti先试水嘛~ 💻 至于Patreon，别worry啦，这纯属for the love of literature！📚 不过说真的，"Scones vs Crumpets"这个angle简直golden！🌟 要不要邀请我那个做food anthropology的friend来guest？她最近刚publish了paper on British colonialism through afternoon tea culture... ☕️ 虽然可能会让你想throw scones at her deconstructionist approach啦~ 😂 这project越来越像我们的mad academic brainchild了！🧠💥
[B]: Ah, a food anthropologist! How dangerously interdisciplinary. While the colonial implications of tea rituals are indeed fascinating—did you know the East India Company's opium trade financed those very tea clippers?—let's not allow postmodern deconstruction to overshadow the simple perfection of a well-baked scone. Though I suppose we could dedicate one 'special episode' to such analysis, provided we balance it with proper appreciation for Mrs. Beeton's original recipes. Just promise me we'll edit out any audible eye-rolls when your friend inevitably declares clotted cream a 'tool of imperial hegemony.' My vintage tea set may never recover from such heresy. Shall we schedule our first recording after finishing Wuthering Heights? I'll prepare a suitably dramatic reading of Catherine's 'I am Heathcliff' speech—preferably during a thunderstorm for atmospheric effect. 🌹
[A]: Deal！⚡️ 我会准备好storm sound effects和emergency scone supply的~ 🍪 不过现在突然realize，我们从casual TV talk一路歪到creating niche literary podcast...这大概就是和你聊天的magic吧！🎩✨ 周三记得穿你最dramatic的Victorian-inspired outfit哦，我要偷偷拍下来当podcast cover art！📸 标题就叫"Two Mad Women in the Attic: A Bronte Podcast"怎么样？😂 现在要去恶补Wuthering Heights了，不然会被你的close reading碾压成moors上的heather... 🌾💨 Catch you on the flip side, professor! 📚☕️
[B]: What splendidly chaotic energy you bring to this endeavor! Though I must protest—'mad women in the attic' indeed! We shall be 'Two Discerning Scholars in the Library,' if you please. Or perhaps 'The Teacup Theorists' for a touch of whimsy. As for my outfit, rest assured I'll wear my 1890s-style high-neck blouse with cameo brooch—the very ensemble that made my graduate students whisper 'Bertha Mason vibes' last semester. Now off you go to those stormy moors, and do take notes; I'll expect at least three properly scandalized reactions to Heathcliff's treatment of Isabella. Until our Wednesday tempest, my partner in literary crime. 🌹
[A]:  Ahem, Professor Eleanor, your 1890s blouse with cameo brooch的description已经让我开始visualize我们的academic aesthetic了！👗💎 不过说真的，"The Teacup Theorists"这个name简直perfect - 既有whimsy又有intellectual depth！🫖✨ 周三见啦，我会带着marginalia满满的copy和至少five properly scandalized gasps准时出现的！😱 现在要去把我的blue yeti擦得shining like new了~ 🎤 别忘了我们的secret safe word是"Eyrehead"哦，万一Heathcliff的toxicity让我们需要紧急scone intervention的时候用！🍪⚡️ P.S. 偷偷告诉你，我连Victorian style的Zoom virtual background都准备好了~ 🖼️
[B]: How delightfully thorough! Though I must insist 'Eyrehead' be reserved for true emergencies—like when our debate over whether Rochester or Heathcliff is the greater romantic catastrophe threatens to devolve into thrown scones. Your Victorian Zoom background is a stroke of genius; mine shall feature my actual bookshelves, though I'll strategically angle the camera to hide the shelf where I keep my annotated 'Twilight' series—some scholarly indulgences are best left unexamined. Until our grand debut, dear co-conspirator. May your marginalia be insightful and your clotted cream unspoiled by postmodern critique. 🌹
