[A]: Ah, you've caught me in a rather uncharacteristic moment - I typically dwell in the pages of Austen and Cao Xueqin rather than cinema. But if pressed, I'd recall that haunting line from 'A Room with a View': "The desire to look a second time at a face... that is the real dividing line." Though I must say, E.M. Forster's original prose in the novel carries far more nuance than the film adaptation.
[A]: Oh, that's such a literary choice! I can totally see why a literature professor would pick that. But what about more modern films? Surely you've seen something contemporary that resonated?
[A]: My dear, I did endure that Marvel spectacle my nephew insisted upon - something about 'with great power comes great responsibility.' Though I found it rather derivative of Voltaire's philosophical treatises on moral obligation. The special effects were... adequate distractions from the popcorn debris littering the theater floor.
[A]: How delightfully academic of you to trace it back to Voltaire! But surely you must have at least one guilty pleasure film? Something you'd never admit to colleagues but secretly enjoy?
[A]:  Well... between us, I may have developed a peculiar fondness for 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.' The meticulous color symbolism and Wes Anderson's almost Victorian attention to visual detail make it rather... palatable. Though I'd never confess this during faculty meetings - Professor Jenkins from the Film Studies department would never let me hear the end of it.
[A]: Ah! So you do have a soft spot for visual storytelling. But tell me, what do you think about the way Anderson uses color compared to, say, Dickens' use of imagery in 'Bleak House'?
[A]: Now you're speaking my language! The fog in 'Bleak House' operates as both literal and metaphorical texture, much like Anderson's pink confectionery palette serves as ironic commentary. Though Dickens' chromatic symbolism emerges organically from London's soot, while Anderson's... well, let's just say his aesthetic owes more to a carefully curated inkwell collection than to naturalistic observation.
[A]: That's such a fascinating comparison! I never thought about connecting Dickens' fog to Anderson's color schemes. You've given me a whole new way to watch films now. Thank you, Dr. Whitmore!
[A]: You're most welcome. Though I must caution - should you start analyzing superhero films through the lens of 19th century realism, do send me an ü¶â before midnight. My graduate students and I could use the comic relief during our weekly 'Middlemarch' reading group.
[A]: Oh I absolutely will! Though I can't promise my analysis will be as eloquent as yours. Maybe I'll start with comparing Thanos to... hmm, let me think... Captain Ahab?
[A]:  Oh my, now there's a dissertation topic waiting to happen! "Moby-Dick in Space: Whaling Imagery in Contemporary Sci-Fi." Do draft that paper - I'll critique it over one of my ¬•800 antique porcelain teacups. Just... perhaps not during Jenkins' office hours next door.
[A]: Deal! Though I might need to borrow some of your Victorian poetry analysis skills to make it sound respectable. Maybe throw in some Tennyson quotes for good measure?
[A]: "Nature, red in tooth and claw" would serve your Thanos thesis rather too well, wouldn't it? Though I'd suggest Browning's "The Ring and the Book" for its thematic parallels with the Infinity Stones.  But we're veering dangerously close to making popular culture... academically respectable. Shall we retreat to safer ground - perhaps Dickens' descriptions of London fog versus Cao Xueqin's misty gardens in 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?
[A]: You're right, we should quit while we're ahead. But this has been the most delightful film discussion I've ever had! Thank you for indulging my Marvel musings with your literary brilliance.
[A]: The pleasure was entirely mine - though I shall now need three chapters of George Eliot and a proper pot of oolong to cleanse my palate of all this... cinematic enthusiasm. Do visit my office anytime - third floor, between the teetering stacks of Bront√´ first editions and the ‰πæÈöÜ-era inkstone collection. Just mind the loose manuscript pages underfoot.
[A]: I'll bring the tea and some proper biscuits next time! Maybe we can find literary parallels in...  Star Wars? But that's a conversation for another day. Goodbye, Dr. Whitmore!
[A]: "May the Force be with you"...  Though I'd much prefer "May the Muse of Literature preserve us." Until next time - and do bring those biscuits from that little shop near the British Museum. Their shortbread rivals Mrs. Elton's wedding biscuits in 'Emma,' though I'd never admit that in print. Farewell!
[A]:  I'll smuggle in some Hobnobs too - our little secret! May the Muses and the Midichlorians both smile upon us until we meet again!
[A]:  Good heavens - now you've mixed Tolkien, Lucas, and Homeric epithets in one breath! I shall need an entire new inkwell to document this cultural... shall we say, syncretism. Until our next clandestine biscuit summit, then. Just...  do knock before mentioning lightsabers near the Romantic Poetry section.
