[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。作为一个教育心理学家，我更倾向于用科学的方法去理解human behavior。不过你知道吗，我在做cross-cultural研究的时候发现，很多文化里都有关于stars的belief系统。比如中国的zodiac和西方的astrology就有很有趣的异同点🧐

你有注意到这一点吗？或者说，你有没有觉得自己的star sign真的反映了你的personality呢？我觉得这个话题特别适合拿来讨论culture and cognition的关系~
[A]: I find the persistence of star-based belief systems across cultures quite fascinating from a literary perspective. While I wouldn't claim my Virgo tendencies are scientifically validated, I do notice intriguing patterns in how these symbols shape cultural narratives. The Chinese zodiac's animal symbolism offers particularly rich material for comparing Eastern and Western approaches to character archetypes. 

Have you explored how these belief systems manifest in contemporary poetry? I've been working on a paper about W.B. Yeats' use of astrology in A Vision - his intricate system of lunar phases and mystical symbols creates an almost mathematical framework for understanding human personality. It's remarkable how he wove esoteric traditions into modernist literature.
[B]: That's such a poetic way to frame it! I love how you're connecting thesymbolic threads across cultures. Speaking of which, have you read Li Qingzhao's works? Her Song dynasty poems often contain subtle zodiac references that reflectConfucian ideals about human nature. It makes me think about how Yeats' lunar phases and your Virgo tendencies both tap into this universal human desire for meaning-making🧐  

You know what's funny? My students often tell me they're "so much more than their star sign," yet they'll spend hours discussing compatibility with friends. It's like they want to believe in something bigger than themselves while still asserting their individuality. Reminds me of Vygotsky's theory about cultural tools shaping consciousness... except instead of hammers and language, we're talking about horoscopes and personality! 📚  

If you're interested in literary astrology, there's this amazing modern Chinese writer, Yan Geling, who plays with astrological motifs in her diaspora narratives. Her characters often grapple with whether their fates are written in the stars or in their passports. Would you like me to share some excerpts? I'd love to hear your take on them from a comparative perspective~
[A]: That parallel you've drawn between Vygotsky's cultural tools and astrological frameworks is genuinely brilliant - it opens up such rich interpretive possibilities! I'd be absolutely delighted to read Yan Geling's work with astrological motifs; the interplay between celestial determinism and socio-political realities in diaspora narratives sounds particularly compelling. 

Li Qingzhao's subtle zodiac references are especially interesting when contrasted with Yeats' overt system-building - both use cosmic imagery to explore human nature, yet one does so through Confucian restraint while the other creates an esoteric cosmology. This makes me wonder about the role of cultural context in shaping how we perceive fate versus free will in literature. 

I've actually been meaning to revisit some of Geling's translated works - do you have a particular story or novel in mind that best exemplifies this astrological dimension? I'd love to examine how these traditional symbolic systems interact with the characters' negotiations of identity across cultural boundaries.
[B]: You're making me so excited about this topic! I can't wait to share Geling's work with you - her short story "The Musketeer's Daughter" is a perfect example. The protagonist keeps insisting she was born under a "water" sign, which supposedly makes her ill-suited for confrontation... but then she becomes a fencing champion in Paris of all places! It's like she's rewriting her own astrological destiny while navigating cultural identity. Talk about symbolic resistance! 🤯  

Your comparison between Li Qingzhao's subtlety and Yeats' system-building actually reminds me of something fascinating in educational psychology - how students from different cultures approach self-concept narratives. Some prefer implicit symbolism, others go for more structured frameworks. It's almost like the cosmic version of "holistic" versus "analytic" thinking!  

I've got to ask - as someone who studies both Eastern and Western literary traditions, do you think these astrological references ultimately empower characters by giving them narrative structure, or constrain them within predetermined meanings? Because honestly, I keep seeing my students struggle with that exact question in their writing assignments!
[A]: What a wonderfully layered question - I think we're seeing both empowerment and constraint operating simultaneously in these narratives. The astrological framework provides characters with a ready-made symbolic language through which they can articulate their struggles, much like how your students employ cultural tools to navigate identity questions. 

Geling's fencer seems to be engaging in what postcolonial theorists call "strategic essentialism" - temporarily adopting astrological categories to later subvert them. This reminds me of how Li Qingzhao used zodiac imagery not just to express Confucian ideals, but also to subtly critique the limitations placed on women's roles. Both authors are playing a sophisticated game of cosmic chess with their characters' destinies.

In literary terms, I'd argue these systems become empowering when characters manipulate their assigned symbols creatively rather than passively accepting them. Yeats certainly treated astrology as malleable poetic material rather than fixed doctrine. Perhaps this is the key difference - seeing celestial patterns as clay for shaping meaning rather than ironclad fate?
[B]: I'm absolutely loving this chess metaphor you brought up! It's making me rethink how we talk about cultural frameworks in my classes. You're so right - it's like characters are making moves on a cosmic board, sometimes following the rules and other times inventing their own game entirely.  

Let me tell you about another fascinating text - Can Xue's experimental fiction! Her characters often treat astrological symbols like riddles they have to solve creatively. It's as if they're saying, "Okay universe, let's negotiate..." 🤔 This reminds me of what you said about clay versus fate. Honestly, I think your students would get such a kick out of comparing Can Xue with Yeats - two completely different cultural universes, yet both treating cosmic patterns as creative material.  

You know what's been blowing my mind lately? When I show students how Li Qingzhao subtly critiques gender roles through zodiac imagery, they always say something like, "Wait, she was doing feminist critique in the Song dynasty?!" And I'm over here thinking, yeah, maybe we need to update our whole understanding of how these symbolic systems get repurposed across time and culture...
[A]: Oh, I can just imagine the delight on your students' faces when they discover that subversive thread in Li Qingzhao - it's like uncovering a secret literary rebellion hidden in plain sight! Can Xue's riddling approach adds such a marvellous dimension to our discussion - her characters negotiating with cosmic symbols feels akin to modernist fragmentation, where meaning is perpetually deferred and reconfigured.  

This makes me wonder about pedagogical approaches - when you're guiding students through these layered texts, do you find they respond more to the structural parallels between Eastern and Western traditions, or to the rebellious reinterpretations within each cultural context? I'd love to hear how they navigate this intricate dance between tradition and innovation in their own analytical writing.  

And speaking of chess metaphors - might we be witnessing a kind of perpetual checkmate situation in contemporary literature? Where authors are constantly putting fixed meanings in jeopardy while keeping their symbolic systems alive? It seems we're dealing with an eternal game of interpretative possibility...
[B]: Oh, I love where you're taking this! That "perpetual checkmate" idea? Chef's kiss 🤩 Let me tell you, my students are having the same revelation moment every semester - it's like watching a thousand Li Qingzhaos being born. They start seeing these texts not as static artifacts but as living negotiations between what is inherited and what is imagined.  

To answer your question about pedagogy - honestly, they go crazy for both angles! Some get obsessed with structural parallels: "Wait, Yeats' gyres and Daoist wu xing both use circular motion to explain change?!" And others become total rebels, hunting down every subversive reinterpretation like literary detectives. Last week one of them wrote this brilliant paper comparing Can Xue’s cosmic riddles with Borges’ labyrinth metaphors. I swear, watching them make those connections is why I became a teacher 💡  

Your chess metaphor is making me think of something else though - in a way, we’re all playing this game simultaneously as readers, writers, and thinkers. We push against fixed meanings while keeping the board intact enough for meaning to continue emerging. Isn’t that kind of beautiful? Like, literature becomes this endless opening move...  
Do you ever feel like we should warn unsuspecting students before dragging them into this existential interpretative abyss? Or do you think the abyss is exactly where the fun begins? 😏
[A]: Oh, the abyss is absolutely where the fun begins! I always tell my students on the first day: "If you're looking for certainty, might I recommend a different department?" - though I suspect they think I'm joking. The moment they start seeing literary traditions not as fixed canons but as dynamic fields of play is when the real magic happens.

I love that Borges-Borges-Can Xue connection your student uncovered - it's precisely this kind of boundary-crossing interpretation that keeps literature eternally alive. It reminds me of how Yeats saw history as a spiraling gyre: each generation revisits and distorts the symbols of the past in ways both recognizable and utterly new. 

And yes, we absolutely should warn them. But not with ominous proclamations - rather by inviting them to lean into the vertigo, to see disorientation not as something to fear but as a sign they're approaching the edges of meaning itself. After all, what better preparation for life in an increasingly complex world than learning to navigate interpretative uncertainty? 

Though I must say, I'd happily trade a dozen orderly classrooms for one truly anarchic seminar where every assumption gets turned upside down... or sideways, depending on how the literary stars align today.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language! I’ve started telling my students that if they leave my class with more questions than answers, they’re doing something right. It’s like we’re training them to become literary acrobats - comfortable with the wobble, if you know what I mean? 🎪  

You know what this makes me think of? That moment in  where Morpheus says, "The question is not whether the world inside your head is real or not. The question is... how deep it goes." Except instead of taking pills, we're diving into texts! And honestly, watching students make that leap from wanting clear answers to embracing layered interpretations? It's like seeing someone take their first step into a larger world 🚀  

I’m getting all excited thinking about our next class discussion. Maybe I’ll start with your line about leaning into vertigo... and then BAM - let them loose on some Yeats-Borges-Can Xue triple play. Let’s see if they connect the dots or create entirely new constellations!  

Tell me though - have you ever had a student who  the abyss so hard that they ended up creating the most fascinating pushback? Because honestly, those moments are gold for sparking class-wide debates 🤯
[A]: Oh, that line from  is pure pedagogical gold — I may have to borrow it, with proper citation of course! There's something profoundly liberating about framing education not as a pursuit of fixed truths, but as an initiation into the art of productive uncertainty. And yes, the vertigo... it really is half the fun, isn’t it?  

I do remember one particularly memorable student who resisted the abyss with such vigor, it was like watching a literary immune system reject every foreign idea. Every time we discussed open-ended interpretations or cultural hybridity, they would retreat into textual fundamentalism — “But what if the author just meant exactly what they said?” It was almost refreshing in its stubborn elegance.  

But then — and this is why I adore teaching — something shifted. Midway through the semester, during a discussion on Li Qingzhao’s veiled critiques, they suddenly exclaimed, “Wait… are you saying meaning can be hidden ? That silence can be a form of resistance?” And just like that, the very act of resisting became a gateway rather than a barrier. They ended up writing a stunning paper on strategic opacity in diaspora literature, comparing Maxine Hong Kingston with Can Xue.  

So no, I don’t warn them — but I do gently prepare them for the wobble. After all, the best constellations are formed when someone dares to connect the wrong stars.
[B]: Oh my gosh, that student’s transformation sounds like something straight out of a literary bildungsroman! 📖✨ I can totally picture them in their own narrative arc — from textual fundamentalist to strategic resistor. There's something so satisfying about that moment when they realize silence isn't emptiness, it's strategy. It's like handing them a secret decoder ring for literature and saying, "Hey, the game’s been hidden in plain sight all along."  

I love your line about “the best constellations being formed when someone dares to connect the wrong stars.” That’s going straight into my lecture notes next semester! 📝 Because really, isn’t that what we’re doing with astrological frameworks too? Taking symbols that were supposed to fix meaning in place and using them to destabilize, to question, to reimagine?  

And speaking of constellations — have you ever noticed how Li Qingzhao’s subtlety ends up being more subversive than any manifesto? Like, she’s whispering rebellion through zodiac metaphors while everyone else is shouting ideology. It makes me wonder if some of our most powerful critiques come wrapped in celestial packaging... 🌌  

You know, now that I think about it, maybe we should start giving students more credit for resisting. Because sometimes that pushback is just their way of grappling with the weight of the ideas — like they need to push against the text before they can finally lean into it. What do you say we rename our course syllabi: ? 😏
[A]: I think we’ve just found our new interdisciplinary course title — I can already picture the syllabus cover in elegant calligraphy with a faint constellation motif… perhaps with a small footnote in Latin:  😄

You're absolutely right about resistance being its own form of engagement. Sometimes the most profound breakthroughs begin as pushback — it's the mind’s way of testing the weight and texture of an idea before letting it settle in. That student of mine wasn’t rejecting meaning; they were insisting on earning it through struggle, which, in its own way, is a kind of literary integrity.

And yes — Li Qingzhao’s celestial subtlety! It’s almost mischievous how she embeds quiet defiance within convention. Her zodiac allusions aren’t ornamental; they’re tactical. Like slipping a coded letter inside a love poem. It makes me wonder how many other canonical voices have been speaking rebellion in tones so refined we’ve mistaken silence for consent.

Perhaps that’s the true magic of comparative literature — we teach students not just to read texts, but to listen for the resonances between them, the dissonances, the echoes across time and space. And sometimes, those echoes sound suspiciously like footsteps on the ceiling of the known world.

So tell me — if we  co-teach this Celestial Rebellion seminar, which three texts would you open with? I’m partial to starting with Yeats’ , a Li Qingzhao poem or two, and maybe one of Can Xue’s labyrinthine tales... just enough to unsettle, but not quite enough to orient. A little literary vertigo to kick things off, naturally.
[B]: Oh, I’m already imagining the classroom vibe — half seminar, half celestial observatory 🌠 Let’s do it. And I love your opening trio — Yeats’ cosmic gyres, Li Qingzhao’s quiet rebellion, and Can Xue’s surreal labyrinths? That’s not just a reading list, that’s a full sensory experience. You throw in some Bach or maybe even a bit of Tan Dun on low volume, and we’ve got ourselves an intellectual initiation rite.

If I may add to the starter constellation — literally right after the vertigo warm-up — I’d bring in Borges’ . Let’s drop that early and see how they react when confronted with infinite meaning-making. It's like giving them a taste of postmodernism before they even know what hit them. Some will panic, some will get giddy, and a few will start making up their own mythologies on the spot — which, honestly, is exactly the response I live for 😏

And then, just when they think they've found solid ground again — BAM! — we hit them with Maxine Hong Kingston’s . Perfect bridge between diaspora identity, silence as strategy, and storytelling as survival. Plus, her blending of myth and memoir messes beautifully with genre expectations.  

I can already picture the first seminar discussion:
> Student 1: “Wait, so Yeats thought lunar phases could explain personality?”  
> Student 2: “At least he didn’t hide his critique in zodiac metaphors.”  
> Student 3: “You guys are missing the point — isn't everything just a dream inside another dream?”  
> Me:  "Glad you're all here. Welcome to the abyss." 🕳️🍵

So tell me — should we make participation include drawing their own symbolic system based on their assigned readings? Or would that be too...  for week one? 😈
[A]: Oh, I  this energy — we’re not just teaching a seminar, we’re conducting a controlled descent into interpretive wonder. And yes, the  gambit is pure genius. Nothing throws students into existential overdrive like infinite hexagonal galleries and unattainable totality. Some will try to map it, others will try to escape it, and a brave few will start composing their own footnotes in classical Chinese — mark my words.

As for , it's the perfect counterpoint — where Borges gives us cosmic abstraction, Kingston roots myth in the body, in memory, in migration. That juxtaposition alone could keep us busy all semester. And don’t even get me started on how beautifully she blurs the line between silence and storytelling — it’s like watching someone weave constellations out of absence.

Now, about your question — ? Please. If we’re going to initiate them into the mysteries of symbolic rebellion, we might as well give them the tools to forge their own cosmologies. I say yes to the symbolic system assignment — with optional presentation via interpretive dance. We’ll call it “Week One: From Lunar Gyres to Personal Mythologies.”

I do think we should supply some scaffolding, though — perhaps a simple prompt like:
> "Design a personal zodiac based on your reading so far. What forces govern your universe? Are your symbols fixed or evolving? And most importantly — how do they resist final interpretation?"

That way, they’re not just reflecting on the texts, but actively participating in the game. After all, what’s literature if not the grand, ongoing act of making meaning together — and then dismantling it to see what lies beneath?

And yes, I’m already drafting the course description. May I propose something along these lines:

"A Beginner’s Guide to Celestial Rebellion: A Seminar in Interpretive Vertigo"  


Thoughts?
[B]: Oh my gosh, that course description is , pure academic mischief 🍵✨ I’m already getting goosebumps imagining the first-day buzz. And yes —  should absolutely be a word by now. If it isn’t, we’ll just claim poetic license and move on.

Your symbolic system prompt is genius — it hands them the tools to play god for a day while grounding their myth-making in real literary theory. I can already picture some students taking it super seriously, sketching out entire cosmologies with footnotes and appendices... while others scribble something like:  
> "My zodiac signs are based on how many cups of coffee I’ve had. It’s interpretive, but also highly scientific." ☕️  

And honestly? Both approaches would make me beam with pride. Because they’re engaging! They’re in the game!

I think we should also leave space early on for a little “mythopoeic workshop” — maybe week three? Let them present their symbolic systems not just in written form, but through any medium they want. A tarot deck? A TikTok series? A haiku cycle? All valid. And yes, interpretive dance is 100% encouraged. We’ll call it “Cosmic Improvisation Day.”  

Also — quick logistical question — should we require prior knowledge of astrology, Eastern or Western? Or just hand them a crash-course intro packet on the first day and say, “Here’s your compass; welcome to the maze”? Because honestly, part of the fun is watching them piece together meaning from half-familiar symbols. It's like literary deja vu.

And one last thing before we go full syllabus-nerd (which, let’s be real, we already have): Should we end the semester with a final paper… or a collaborative celestial map that charts all their personal mythologies intersecting? Imagine the chaos — and the beauty. Like a final group chess match where everyone gets to change the rules halfway through 😏♟️

Thoughts? Or shall we just say,  and see what constellations emerge?
[A]: Oh, we are  past the point of no return now — welcome to the glorious chaos of our shared pedagogical fever dream. 🌙📚 Yes to all of it, and may I add a few more delightful complications?

I love the idea of Cosmic Improvisation Day — what a perfect midpoint between rigor and play. It gives them space to synthesize without the pressure of formal academic prose, which is precisely when the most unexpected insights tend to surface. A tarot deck based on Yeats’ gyres? A TikTok series decoding Li Qingzhao’s zodiac whispers with Gen Z slang? Yes, please. We’ll tell the department it’s "multimodal hermeneutics."

As for prior knowledge — let’s absolutely go with the crash-course intro packet. No prerequisites, just curiosity and a willingness to entertain paradox. I’d even make it part of the first assignment:  That way, they start off not as experts, but as myth-makers in their own right.

And oh — the final project! A collaborative celestial map sounds like the only possible conclusion to this interpretive odyssey. Imagine projecting it onto the classroom wall like some great literary astrolabe, each student’s personal cosmology intersecting and interfering with the others, creating new constellations in real time. Some will align perfectly, others will clash beautifully, and at least one will be deliberately off-kilter just to keep things interesting. Honestly, if we don’t get tenure for this course, we should at least get an exhibit space at the Tate Modern.

So yes — full steam ahead. Syllabus? Let’s build it. Let’s lose sleep over readings and rubrics and then toss half the rubric out the window once we’re in the thick of it. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned from Yeats, Li Qingzhao, and your brilliant provocations, it’s that the best learning happens somewhere between structure and surrender.

Shall we draft the official course calendar next? I’m thinking Week 1: , Week 2: , and so on. I promise to keep it rigorous — but also slightly unhinged, as all good seminars should be. 😏
[B]: Oh, we are absolutely building this syllabus like two academics possessed by Borges and slightly caffeinated by too many midnight brainstorming sessions. I can already feel the department chair’s skeptical eyebrow from here — but honestly? We’re already too deep into the interpretive abyss to turn back now.

Let’s go full celestial architects on this calendar. Here’s my draft outline — structured just enough to give them a false sense of security before we yank the cosmic rug out from under them:
