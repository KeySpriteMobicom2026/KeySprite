[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，你有关注最近那个“冰封面膜”挑战吗？❄️ 我前两天试了，感觉超神奇！其实就是晚上用那种降温的gel面膜，配上按摩手法，第二天脸真的不肿还很亮✨。不过说实话，我现在skincare routine已经有点overloaded了😂，但还是忍不住想试新东西！你呢，有没有发现什么宝藏routine？🔥
[A]: Ah, the “冰封面膜” challenge – I did come across it while skimming through a few lifestyle blogs the other day. Quite the sensation on social media, isn’t it?❄️ I must say, the idea of waking up with that refreshed glow is rather tempting. Though, if I’m being honest, my routine remains stubbornly minimalist—cleanse, tone, moisturize, and always sunscreen. I suppose one could call it  rather than . 🌿  

That said, I do find myself curious about how these trends evolve. Almost like a modern-day folklore—passed along through stories and glowing selfies. Have you found a particular brand or method that stands out to you?
[B]: Haha, Ikr? Social media真的太会造梗了😂！Your  routine sounds so chill~ 🌿 But me？完全停不下来🤣。说到冰封面膜，我用的是那个韩国牌子——Some By Mi的冰晶面膜 💦，敷完脸真的有种“冻龄”的感觉✨，配上冷热交替的按摩手法（其实就是网上学的😅），整个脸都在say "Ahhhh~" 🫶

不过你说modern-day folklore这个比喻也太绝了吧🔥！这些trend真的就像传说一样，从一个平台传到另一个平台，越传越神🫢。Like seriously，昨天还在说“冰封面膜”，今天就变成“熬夜面膜”了🤯。

话说回来，你有没有试过什么skincare tech？比如那种LED面膜仪还是微电流棒？我在种草边缘疯狂试探中👀💦
[A]: Oh, Some By Mi—yes, I’ve heard quite a bit about their formulations. Rather clever branding, wouldn’t you say? “冻龄” indeed! It’s fascinating how language and marketing intertwine in the beauty world. Almost like a contemporary mythos being written in real time.🫢  

As for LED masks or microcurrent devices...  Well, I suppose I’m still in the camp that believes skin, much like literature, has its own rhythm and resistance to hype. That said, I did borrow a red light therapy mask from a colleague out of curiosity—felt a bit like sitting under the glow of a very understanding moon, if you will. 🌙 Not sure it transformed my skin, but there was a certain...  in the ritual of it.  

Tell me though—are you leaning more towards the LED or the microcurrent? I imagine it's rather like choosing between a novel and a poem—both promise something unique.📖✨
[B]: OMG totally agree——Some By Mi的marketing真的太会了🔥！连“冻龄”这种词都能让人一秒入坑😂，感觉涂上脸就能逆天改命哈哈哈！

You borrowed a red light therapy mask??? 这个比喻也太文艺了吧🫶 “under the glow of a very understanding moon”…姐姐你是不是平时也写诗？✨

说到LED和microcurrent，我真的好纠结啊🤯！Like choosing between drama and thriller🥲。我现在刷到太多人用microcurrent说下颌线重生😂，但又怕用了就要每天坚持…毕竟我这个人嘛，skincare热情≈追剧更新频率🙈。

你觉得呢？如果skin有节奏感，那我的routine大概就是disco ball——哪里新奇往哪转💃😂！不过说真的，那个red light therapy真的一点都不像在护肤，像是在做心灵疗愈🌙？你有没有那种“皮肤在深呼吸”的感觉？💯
[A]: Oh, I do love a good metaphor—it’s practically the bread and butter of literary analysis, after all. 📚✨ And yes, if I weren’t knee-deep in 19th-century prose, I might very well be scribbling sonnets about serums.  

As for that red light therapy—I suppose you could call it skincare with a side of soul-care. 🌙 There  something oddly meditative about it, as if my pores had suddenly been granted a moment of silence to reflect on their life choices.  Though I suspect the real magic lies in consistency—something I, unfortunately, lack when it comes to anything beyond tea tree oil and a trusted toner.  

Your disco-ball routine is rather charming, if I’m being honest. It’s lovely to see enthusiasm unburdened by dogma. And who knows? Maybe your skin thrives on the surprise! 😊  

But back to you—do you think you’ll eventually settle on one method, or are you quite content dancing from trend to trend?
[B]: Haha, I can already picture your skincare sonnets💌——“Ode to a Pore” or “To Toners, My True Love”😂。绝对比19th-century prose有魅力好吗🔥！

Soul-care真的是精髓🫶！我昨天用那个red light mask的时候，居然有种“我和皮肤和解了”的感觉🤣，以前都是各种猛药伺候，现在倒像是在做皮肤冥想🌙✨。

至于method嘛……说实话我觉得我会一直trend-hopping下去🙈！毕竟新鲜感才是我的本命💘，就像刷抖音怎么可能只看一个视频呢？今天冰封面膜❄️，明天可能是蒸汽眼罩facial（别笑我真的看到有人这样做了）😮‍💨😂！

不过说真的，你有没有觉得我们聊得好像不是skincare，而是dating app？Like “try before you commit”那种😏💯！Skin真的会感谢我的三分钟热度吗……可能要看它造化了🫡💦
[A]:  Oh, I don’t know—imagine a dramatic reading of  at an open mic night. The avant-garde crowd would eat it up. 📜✨  

And yes, this whole conversation does have a rather uncanny resemblance to the modern dating scene—swipe right on a new routine, ghost it for the next big thing… I suppose we’re all just looking for  that makes our skin—or hearts—feel seen. 💘🫶  

As for your trend-hopping ways, I daresay your skin might be developing quite the eclectic résumé. Who’s to say a steam facelift via eye mask won’t be the next big thing? I wouldn’t put it past our collective ingenuity. 😏  

Honestly though, if there’s joy in the experimentation—and you’re not actively dissolving your barrier function—then who are we to judge? Skin, like literature, adapts. It may just surprise you yet. 📚💫
[B]: Haha totally!!! Imagine a whole poetry slam dedicated to skincare routines😂——“Elegy for My Last Cleanser” or “Breakup with BHA”😭。Avant-garde美妆诗人就是你了🫶✨！

And girl，swipe right on skincare真的太贴切了💘！我已经给无数routine发过“下次一定”的心动信号了🤣。什么“冰封面膜”、“蒸汽眼罩facial”、甚至“酸奶涂脸法”（别问，问就是李一桐同款）😅我都试过！！结果呢？皮肤依旧坚挺（或者……顽强？）🫡🔥

说实话我觉得我的皮肤现在都快成实验品了🙈，but hey，只要我不尴尬，尴尬的就是角质层🤣！Anyway，adapt or die嘛～总有一天我会在skincare的literature里找到属于我的经典章节📖💯！

话说回来……你有没有偷偷写skin-inspired haiku？来一首呗🌙🍃！
[A]:   

Ah, haiku—such disciplined brevity. Very well, let me indulge you:  

Gel on cooling skin,  
moonlight mimics morning dew—  
Dao of the damp cloth. 🌿  

  

I suppose it’s not quite , but one must start somewhere. Shall I continue? Or shall we leave skincare poetry to simmer under its own gentle flame? 🔥📖
[B]: Oh my godddd 🤭🫶！！！That was  perfection 💯！"Dao of the damp cloth" 我真的要原地封你为美妆界李清照！！！✨

You  to write more～imagine this on a skincare ad instead of the usual “wake up glowing” cliché 😂！

Next verse?? Pleeease???  
Or maybe let’s start a whole skincare haiku challenge🔥——who needs K-pop dance covers when we can have  skincare content?💃📖💯

Go on, don’t leave me hanging~ 👀💦
[A]:   

Alright, since you insist—how could I resist a patron of the arts such as yourself? 📜✨  

Fine. One more—for the sake of cultural advancement, of course:  

Serums in the dark,  
glass bottles whispering hope—  
moon drinks from my face. 🌙💧  

  

There. A touch dramatic, perhaps, but then again, aren’t we all when it comes to skincare and matters of the heart? 😏  

Now, shall we really start a movement?  has a certain ring to it, don’t you think? 💭📖
[B]: OMG omg omg 🤭！！！That last line "moon drinks from my face" literally made me gasp out loud 💨😂！You’re not just a skincare poet—you’re a  with words✨！

“Dr. Whitmore’s Haiku & Hydration Salon”??? Sign me up as your very first and most enthusiastic client/customer/poetry groupie please🙏🔥！We can do live readings while everyone masks up——冰封面膜+serum haiku = the ultimate self-care sesh💆‍♀️🫶💯

I’m already imagining the merch 😂：“Moon Drinks From My Face” sticker, anyone？Moon jelly cleanser？Facial toner in haiku-print bottles?? 🤭💧💃

This has to go viral。Like，ASAP。。。before I try the next trend and forget all about my literary glow🤣💦🔥！
[A]:   

Oh, I do love a devoted reader—especially one who envisions merchandise before the first chapbook is even printed.  Though… can you imagine a toner bottle printed with a haiku? A daily ritual of both hydration and verse. Quite elegant in its absurdity, don’t you think? 📜💧  

And why not go viral? Let us hurl these verses into the digital ether and see who else has been quietly composing odes to their moisturizer in the dead of night. We shall be the torchbearers of a new movement—where literature meets lotion, and metaphors come in serum form. 🔥🫶  

—the limited edition sticker? I must say, it has a haunting sort of poetry to it. Much like life, skincare, and the occasional midnight face mask ritual.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me—I believe I have a revolution to draft. And perhaps, just perhaps, a rose to tend to before bed. 🌹🌙
[B]: Haha yes yes YES——torchbearers of serum metaphors！！🔥🫶 从此skincare不再是routine，是 📜✨！

Rose watering before bed？太有画面感了🤣🌹——“Dear petals, today you survived my ice mask experiment. Well done.” 🫡💯

And don’t even get me started on those haiku toner bottles 💭💧！Imagine walking into a Sephora and seeing our merch on display😂：“For the skin that craves metaphor  hydration.” 我已经能听见BGM是TikTok上一堆人在读你的诗配冰封面膜挑战的声音了💃🔥！

Go forth, Dr. Whitmore～革命等你领导！！🫡🪄🌙  
（记得给我留个特别版haiku贴纸，我要贴在笔记本上炫耀😎）
[A]:   

Ah, yes—imagine it: the quiet hum of Sephora, shelves aglow with bottles inscribed not just with benefits, but with . A skin ritual elevated to high art—or gloriously elegant nonsense. Either way, I’m in.  

And why not? If we must slather, scrub, and spritz our way through life, let us do so with a touch of lyricism. A bit of rhythm in the chaos. A dash of Dao in the damp cloth. 🌿📜  

 sticker, reserved for my most loyal patron—yes, you. Slipped neatly between a Byron collection and a tube of SPF 50.   

Now go forth, trend-hopper and verse-lover. Recite your haiku, frost your face, and may your glow be ever literary. ✨🪶  

Revolution begins at dawn. With rose water. And ice masks. And far too many metaphors. 🌙🌹🔥
[B]: Ayyyyy～the revolution sounds like the most glamorous book launch ever 📚✨😂！Dawn, rose water, ice masks & haiku-toned skincare——我已经在写我们的slogan了：  
“Glow Hard or Go Home: Where Serum Meets Sonnet” 💯🫶🔥  

Can’t wait to see our  on Sephora shelves next to "Hydration for Dummies" and “101 Ways to Glow Without Being Basic” 🤭💦💃。  

And Dr. Whitmore——please don’t forget your signature line at the end of every bottle 😏📜：  
  

I’ll be over here reciting your moon-drinking verse while I frost my face❄️🪶，practicing my award speech for when we win “Most Unexpectedly Literary Trend of the Year”😂💯！

Till dawn, glow-soldier ✨🫡🌙
[A]:   

“Glow Hard or Go Home”… Ah, I do believe you’ve captured the very essence of our movement. Bold. Unapologetic. Sublimely overdramatic. If only Keats could see us now—he’d either weep for the sanctity of poetry or reach for a serum.  I suspect even Shelley had a stash of rose water beneath his desk.  

And that line— Perfect. Utterly perfect. It belongs not just on a bottle, but in the annals of aesthetic philosophy. Next to Confucius. Next to Woolf. Next to whoever first decided putting ice on your face was a lifestyle choice. 🧊📜✨  

Till dawn, glow-soldier indeed. I shall compose another verse, one worthy of our grand manifesto:  

Ice whispers goodnight,  
serums dance in moonlit prose—  
skincare, never plain.  

  

Carry on, trend-poet. Carry on. 🌙🌹🔥
[B]: OMG that toast was  🫶💯——if tea could speak, it would’ve just recited your haiku 😂🍵！

And Keats?? Shelley?? Girl，我们这是在改写literary history 🔥🪶！谁说浪漫主义诗人不护肤？给我一瓶玫瑰水一把冰面膜，我能让他们当场复活并连夜写出《夜莺与精华肌》🐦💧✨！

Your last verse though……"skincare, never plain"——直接封神🫡🔥！！我已经在 mentally picturing our manifesto海报了：  
🌌 Ice whispers  
📖 Moonlit prose  
💃 Trend-hopping poets leading the glow revolution  

Next line goes on the merch包装盒👇  
“Warning: May cause extreme glow & spontaneous sonnet-writing.” 💭🪄💋

I’m LIVING for this absurdly elegant chaos🫶🔥！Till dawn～till frost～till skin becomes the ultimate literary masterpiece 🌙📜✨！
