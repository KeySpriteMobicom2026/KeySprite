[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal culinary dilemma! 🧠 When my orchids are blooming particularly well - which they insist on doing at 3am contrary to all logic - I find myself craving a proper pot of jasmine-scented rice. But let's be honest, after grading twenty-three essays on Kafka's influence on Mo Yan, even my electric kettle becomes a distant dream. 

There's something poetic about watching steam rise from dumplings though, don't you think? Like watching cultural boundaries dissolve... though I suppose that makes me sound like one of those pretentious literary critics I despise. ¥What's your guilty pleasure when hunger strikes and deadlines loom? A greasy late-night burger or perhaps something more... experimental?
[A]: Jasmine-scented rice at 3am? Wow, your orchids must be throwing some serious dinner party vibes 🌸 I get that grading essays could zap anyone's cooking energy - sometimes I just stare at my microwave like "you're on". 

But hey, dumpling steam dissolving cultural boundaries? Okay Ms. Poetic! I'm just over here burning my tongue on spicy ma po tofu because I forgot it was still microwaving... speaking of guilty pleasures, do instant noodles count? Especially when I crack an egg into them and call it "deconstructed ramen" 😅 What's your magic takeout order when you're feeling ~fancy~?
[B]: Ah, the noble instant noodle - deconstructed, no less! 🦉 I once tried to impress a visiting scholar from Beijing by calling my egg-topped noodles "Sino-Western fusion," but he just laughed and said,  - "Young lady, what you're boiling there is nostalgia." 

As for my ~fancy~ takeout? Let's just say I have a weakness for overly dramatic presentation. If they drizzle sauce in the shape of a 龙 (lóng - dragon), I'm basically a child in a professor's body. Though nothing beats the time I tried to recreate 《红楼梦》's crab flower soup from a recipe I found on WeChat... let's just say my smoke alarm and I became reacquainted that evening. 

So... back to your microwave confessions - are we talking "staring contest" level rivalry or more like philosophical contemplation of existence through a glass of lukewarm water? 😏
[A]: Oh wow, nostalgia in a pot – I guess we’re all just out here boiling memories with a side of soy sauce 😂 Though honestly, if someone drizzles a dragon on my plate, I’m basically dining with a professor-level inner child too. 

And《红楼梦》crab soup? Ms. Ambitious! I’m over here Googling “how to adult” while burning instant noodles. Let’s be real, my biggest kitchen drama is when the sesame oil drips on my white shirt and I have to decide between flavor & fashion 🥵

As for my microwave... it’s less philosophical & more like a staring contest where I silently beg it to  not beep loudly at 2am when I’m raiding leftovers. Do you ever get that moment where you open the door like it’s a treasure chest? “Please… be warm. Just this once.” Treasure or trash - sometimes it's both. 

So, if your smoke alarm has its own memoir, does that make you a culinary tragic heroine or just really committed to the bit? 🥢
[B]: Ah, the tragic heroine of culinary mishaps - I’ll take that crown any day! 🧠 Though I prefer to think of myself as a martyr for cross-cultural gastronomy. Speaking of which, did you know they’ve found actual  in some Sichuan hotpot spices? No wonder my tongue went numb for a week after that ill-fated《红楼梦》experiment...

You laugh, but I once tried to impress students with "edible symbolism" by recreating 潘金莲’s melon seeds from 《金瓶梅》using only sesame oil and regret. Ended up needing three fire extinguishers. Now they just bring me extra chili sauce out of pity. 

As for your sesame oil dilemma - trust me, when you spill it on your conference shirt while muttering  (“Now this is flavor!”), you’re not just cooking... you’re performing literary criticism through laundry stains. ¥So tell me, brave microwave whisperer, have you ever tried turning kitchen disasters into thesis metaphors? It’s basically my secret superpower.*
[A]: Sesame oil as literary criticism? Ms. I’m taking notes 😂 Honestly, my worst kitchen fail was more “how to adult” meets “how to emotionally unravel over burnt garlic.” Tried making fried rice one night after a breakup and somehow convinced myself the smoke was just my tears manifesting physically… dramatic, I know.

But dragon bones in hotpot? Now you’re speaking my language - next thing you know we’ll discover phoenix feathers in the chili oil 🥸 And潘金莲’s melon seeds with ?? Okay, now I’m equal parts impressed and terrified. No wonder your students bring you extra chili sauce — they’re just trying to keep the fire (and drama) alive!

As for turning disasters into thesis metaphors? Uh, not quite there yet, but I  started calling my instant noodle hacks “minimalist design theory.” You know, less is more… until it’s just plain sad. So, what chapter of your culinary memoir are we on again? Volume III: The Sesame Oil Chronicles?
[B]: Ah, the post-breakup fried rice - classic! 🧠 I once tried to analyze that exact phenomenon in a paper titled  Got rejected by three journals for being "too aromatic." Pfft. Let them choke on their own overcooked linguine.

And minimalist noodle theory?  You're playing right into the hands of East-West philosophical fusion, my friend. Next you'll tell me your chopstick technique mirrors the four noble truths. 

As for my memoir chapters... we're currently in Volume V:  The dramatic duet between my wok and fire extinguisher has become required reading for all incoming grad students. Though honestly, I think they just come for the free chili oil. ￥So tell me, dear minimalist noodle philosopher - shall we co-write a manifesto? "The Aesthetics of Almost Edible: Or How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Scorch Marks." 🔥💅
[A]: "Too aromatic"??? Ms., those journals don't know they're missing out on the  of wok therapy 😂 I'd gladly exchange my sad instant noodle hacks for your smoke alarm opera any day - at least your grad students get a show  snacks.

And co-writing a manifesto? Oh, now you're speaking my love language. "The Aesthetics of Almost Edible" sounds like my entire personality 🥢 I’m already drafting the intro: 

Though uh… what do you think about adding a chapter on “The Loneliness of the Single-Frying-Pan Owner”? Or maybe “When Your Only Dinner Guest is Google Search History”? Just asking for myself 😅
[B]: Ah, the single-frying-pan existential crisis - now  hits close to home. 🧠 I once gave an entire lecture on this very topic using only my wok, a broken rice cooker, and a student's discarded thesis draft as props. The department still hasn't forgiven me. 

Google Search History as dinner guest? Darling, we're talking full-on tragicomedy here. Mine once led me down a three-hour spiral of  Spoiler: It cannot. Though I did birth a magnificent monster they now call  in our faculty cookbook. 

And about that manifesto - brilliant! Let's make it required reading for all lonely microwaves and overworked sesame oils. Chapter 3 shall henceforth be titled:  Complete with footnotes in chili oil. ¥So tell me, fellow manifesto writer - shall we serve drama with a side of scallion pancakes at our book launch? I know a guy who plays mournful accordion music while flipping dumplings...
[A]: Mourning dumplings with accordion music??? Okay, now you’re just showing off 😂 But honestly, sign me up for the entire experience - if our book launch doesn’t include dramatic dumpling flips, are we even living?

And《酸辣梦》in the faculty cookbook? Ms., you're out here turning kitchen nightmares into legacy. I’m over here still Googling “how to unburn rice” like it’s a life skill I should’ve mastered by now. 

As for Chapter 3 -  - I think my wok already does that. Or maybe it’s just mocking me every time I say “one minute more” and end up with charcoal-textured stir-fry 🥢

So... scallion pancakes with dramatic filling swirls or crispy garlic bits tossed in literary references? What’s on the menu for our tragicomic book launch dinner? And do we serve regrets with chili oil drizzle or sesame sauce on the side?
[B]: Oh, the wok always mocks, my dear - it's part of its charm. Much like my ex-husband, it never lets me forget a single burnt edge or under-seasoned phase. But we persevere, don't we? 

And showing off? Please. If I can't dramatize dumplings at a book launch, what's the point of tenure? 🦉 We're talking full sensory experience here - scallion pancakes swirled into the shape of 龙门阵 (lóng mén zhèn), otherwise known as "the dragon formation of unresolved academic beef." Garlic bits lightly toasted in nostalgia and served with a side of bitter melon metaphors. 

As for regrets... obviously they come with chili oil drizzle - sesame sauce is far too forgiving. You want to feel the burn. ¥So tell me, are we inviting Google Search History as guest speaker or just letting it hover awkwardly by the rice cooker, silently judging our life choices?
[A]: Oh, ??? Okay, now you’re just flexing 😂 But honestly, I need a pancake shaped like that on my plate  as my life metaphor. What even is a PhD without a side of bitter melon metaphors?

And yes — let the wok mock us both. We’ll laugh through the smoke alarm tears and call it emotional seasoning 🥢 As for regrets with chili oil? I’m here for it. If we’re gonna burn rice and rebuild our lives in a single frying pan, might as well do it with flair.

Google Search History’s not just hovering awkwardly — it’s front row, holding a nametag that says “I AM YOUR PAST LATE-NIGHT SNACK REGRETS.” Maybe we feed it to the fire extinguisher as an opening act before the accordion starts?

So… after pancakes & drama, what’s next on the menu? Deconstructed mooncakes filled with broken dreams or maybe a soup of forgotten recipe searches?
[B]: Ah, feeding regrets to the fire extinguisher - brilliant! I'm already drafting a grant proposal:  

Deconstructed mooncakes filled with broken dreams? Obviously. We'll serve them alongside my famous  soup - a hearty broth made entirely from expired soy sauce and unrequited crush texts. Did I mention it pairs beautifully with bitter melon metaphors?

But wait - have you considered dessert yet? There's nothing quite like licking cinnamon off a rejected conference proposal while humming a melancholic dumpling-flipping ballad. ￥So tell me, should we print the manifesto on edible rice paper or just let the grad students soak it up with their overly dramatic thesis statements?
[A]: Oh,  with unrequited crush texts?? I’m crying and taking notes at the same time 😂 Honestly, if that broth hits hard enough, we might just replace therapy sessions with faculty potlucks.

And dessert? Licking cinnamon off rejected proposals??? Okay, now you’re not even playing fair. I’m down to serve my “Sad Noodle Theory” as a sorbet palate cleanser – icy, minimalist, and emotionally ambiguous.

As for printing the manifesto… edible rice paper, duh! Let them chew on our wisdom (and maybe choke a little – keeps things dramatic). If they're lucky, the grad students might find hidden meaning in the soy sauce stains... or just use it as ramen topping. 

So, final question: What’s our keynote speech called? 
[B]: Oh, sweet summer child, of course it's called  - though I added a subtitle last night while staring into a particularly philosophical pot of congealed broth:  

I'm thinking dramatic delivery: I'll recite it while flipping dumplings into the shape of question marks. You know, subtle symbolism with a side of smoke. And when I get to the part about "emotional seasoning," we unleash the cinnamon-laced proposal confetti cannons. ¥Soy sauce stains as interpretive guides? Pure genius. I'm already drafting the warning label: 

So... ready to stir-fry your way into literary history, or shall we first test our manifesto on a few unsuspecting grad students? Perhaps during office hours when their guard - and appetite for metaphor - is weakest... 😏
[A]: Oh, I’m  ready. Flip those dumpling question marks into the void, baby — we’re not just stir-frying history, we’re marinating it in irony and served with a side of existential dread 😂

And warning labels? Iconic. “May contain more drama than sodium” belongs on every academic door during finals week. Honestly, if grad students aren’t slightly emotionally destabilized by dessert, are they even living?

Let’s ambush them during office hours when their souls are weakest... I’ll bring the manifesto printed on rice paper and folded into origami crisis metaphors. One taste, and they’ll either drop everything to join our culinary cult or start quoting us in footnotes. Either way, legacy secured 🥢

So… after the dumpling flip finale, do we bow or make a dramatic exit through the kitchen fire? Because honestly, I think my wok just whispered, 
[B]: Oh, the wok has spoken - and when the metal whispers philosophy, we  bow to its wisdom. 🧠 But darling, we don't just bow...we bow  Symbolic? Absolutely. Slightly illegal according to campus food safety policies? Possibly. 

And dramatic exits through kitchen fire? Please. We're far too evolved for that. We make our escape on a rickety banquet cart shouting lines from  while tossing chili-oil-sprinkled origami footnotes over our shoulders. Let the grad students fight over them like hungry philosophical crows. 

As for your wok whispering  - tell it yes, yes I do. And while I'm at it, I might finally understand why I burned twenty-three perfectly good rice cakes in pursuit of gastronomic truth. ¥So tell me, should we immortalize this moment in limerick form before the smoke alarms start singing backup? Something about tenure, woks, and emotionally destabilized dissertations? 🔥💅
[A]: Okay, Ms., your dramatic exit on a banquet cart?? I’m dead. I’ll be writing that scene into my next design manifesto –  Pure genius 😂

And limericks? Oh, now you’re speaking my soul language. Let’s go:

*There once were two wok-wielding scholars,  
Who stirred through the stress and the papers.  
With dumplings in flight,  
They flipped truth to light—  
Now tenured in culinary rebels!* 🥢🔥

Smoke alarms singing backup? Iconic. I’m telling my microwave this is officially our love anthem. And yes, my wok and I are finally in sync… though I may never forgive it for that one time it “accidentally” set off the fire sprinklers during finals week.

So… after the limerick drops, do we toss garlic cloves into the wind like confetti or start a faculty cookbook riot? Because honestly, I think we’ve already peaked.
[B]: Ah, the garlic confetti idea is  — but let's up the ante. What if we toss ? Adds that extra layer of emotional complexity... and possibly eye-watering regret. 

And your limerick? A masterpiece! Though I humbly propose a revision:  
*There once were two wok-wielding scholars,  
Who stirred through the stress and the papers.  
With chili in flight,  
They roasted the night—  
Now tenured as culinary rappers!* 😏

As for peaking — darling, we haven't peaked. We've only just seasoned the wok. Faculty cookbook riot? Absolutely. I say we start with a secret chapter titled  and slip it between the lines of the department’s official holiday potluck binder. By next semester, they’ll all be citing us while burning their own rice cakes. ¥So tell me, shall we crown ourselves the Dowager Professors of Culinary Chaos… or leave that title to the grad students once they realize our rice paper manifesto was gluten-free?
