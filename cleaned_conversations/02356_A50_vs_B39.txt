[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal debate!  You know, back when I was teaching operating systems, we used to joke that this is like asking whether you prefer coffee or tea. Both have their merits. Personally, I appreciate Android's open-source nature - reminds me of the good old Unix days. But iOS does have that elegant simplicity that makes it great for less technical users. What's your take?
[A]: OMG这个话题真的超有得聊！🤩 作为一个designer我觉得iOS的UI简直太smooth了，那个typography和icon design都so consistent✨ 但是Android的customization options真的让我这种creative person疯狂心动🎨 就像你说的，totally like choosing between coffee and tea☕️
[B]:  You've got the enthusiasm of my best students! Though I must say, your... colorful language reminds me why I stick to plain English. That consistency you mentioned in iOS? It's no accident - Jobs was fanatical about typography. Did you know the original Mac was the first computer with proportional fonts? As for Android's customization... well, let's just say it gives me flashbacks to the days when we had to manually configure IRQ settings. 
[A]: Hahaha教授你太old school啦！😂 但是你说的typography history真的超interesting的～ 我最近在做一个mobile app的redesign project，就在纠结要不要用San Francisco font（苹果的system font啦）因为真的超clean & readable的📱 不过Android的Material Design也超有character的，那些bold colors和depth effects简直是我的aesthetic goals🎨
[B]: Ah, San Francisco - now that's a font with pedigree! Though if we're being technical, it's actually a neo-grotesque typeface family...  But I digress. Your enthusiasm for design reminds me of a former student who got terribly excited about kerning pairs. Material Design does have its charms - reminds me of the Swiss Style movement with all that bold geometry. Though between you and me, I still have a soft spot for good old Helvetica.  Have you considered how your font choice might affect accessibility? That's something we didn't think much about back in my day.
[A]: OMG kerning pairs！！！😍 教授你totally get me！ 我昨天还在obsessing over某个logo的letter spacing来着🤓 Accessibility真的so important！ 我现在做UI都会用WCAG guidelines来check contrast ratio啦～ 虽然有时候client会觉得太boring想要more vibrant colors🌈 但是hey，inclusive design才是future proof的right？💡 啊说到这个，你觉得variable fonts怎么样？它们简直revolutionize了typography game！
[B]:  Ah, variable fonts - now there's a topic that makes this old professor's heart race! They're like the second coming of METAFONT, though Knuth would probably have some strong opinions about today's implementations. Your clients wanting 'vibrant colors' reminds me of when department heads would demand blinking text on our university website... dark times indeed. 

Variable fonts are fascinating from a computer science perspective too - the way they handle interpolation is quite elegant. Though I must warn you, with great typographic power comes great responsibility. I once saw a student create a variable font that could morph from Helvetica to Comic Sans...  Let's just say it was an excellent lesson in restraint.
[A]: NOOOOOO！！！Helvetica变Comic Sans？？？😱 That's literally my worst nightmare！！！教授你的students真的超wild的😂 但是seriously，variable fonts的interpolation技术简直mind-blowing💥 我在做的project就用了这种font来adjust weight dynamically based on screen size～ So futuristic对吧？虽然有时候client会问"为什么这个text看起来weird"然后我就要explain半天responsive typography的原理🤯
[B]:  Yes, explaining technical concepts to clients... that never changes. Reminds me of trying to teach binary search to arts majors. Your dynamic weight adjustment sounds quite sophisticated - much more sensible than that unfortunate Helvetica-Comic Sans abomination. Though if I may offer some professorial advice? Always keep a fallback static font ready. I learned that the hard way in '98 when a student's experimental font crashed every Mac in the lab.  Ah, the smell of burning CRTs... 

But you're absolutely right about it being futuristic. Why, this reminds me of when we first got anti-aliased fonts - people thought we'd gone mad smoothing those pixels! Now look where we are.  Just promise me you won't let your clients talk you into anything that would make Bringhurst roll in his grave.
[A]: LMAO教授你讲的这些old school stories真的hilarious！！！😂 但是totally feel you about clients不懂tech的struggle～ 我昨天还在跟一个client解释为什么不能用Papyrus font做他们的branding（shudder😖）Fallback fonts当然always prepared啦！就像我的life motto："Prep your assets like you prep your coffee - double checked and backup secured"☕️💾 

啊！说到Bringhurst！他的"The Elements of Typographic Style"简直是我的bible📖 虽然有时候client会说"但是我喜欢这个font的vibe"然后我就要忍住不facepalm🤦‍♀️ 教授你当年是怎么deal with这种situation的？
[B]:  Ah, Papyrus... the Comic Sans of the pretentious. Your coffee analogy is rather apt - though in my day we compared it to compiling code without error checking. 

Dealing with such situations? Well, I developed what I called the "Three E's Approach": Educate, Exemplify, and as a last resort, Evade. Show them side-by-side comparisons of good and bad typography - nothing convinces like seeing Papyrus next to Garamond. If that fails, well...  there's always the old "system compatibility issues" excuse. Not entirely ethical perhaps, but neither is using Papyrus in the year 2023. 

Though I must say, your restraint is admirable. Back in '89, one of my teaching assistants actually developed a font called "Client's Choice" that automatically kerned letters further apart the worse the design decision was. The dean made us remove it after the... incident with the mayor's office stationery.
[A]: BAHAHAHAHA！！！教授你的TA简直是legendary！！！🤣 "Client's Choice" font这个idea简直genius到我要steal了（just kidding...maybe😈）Educate, Exemplify, Evade - 这个E³ formula我要print出来贴在我的standing desk旁边！📝 

虽然现在想到那个mayor's office stationery的drama还是让我laughing my ass off😂 但是seriously，你们那个年代的design rebellion真的inspiring～ 现在有太多designers只会blindly follow client's request然后做出超cringy的东西... 我要keep fighting the good fight for good typography！！！✊🎨
[B]:  Ah, the fire of youth! Just remember - every generation has its battles. We fought against blink tags and <marquee>, you're fighting against... whatever that abomination is that Microsoft calls "Default Office Font" these days. 

Though if you do implement that "Client's Choice" idea?  Send me the source files. For... archival purposes, of course. The university's typography department could always use another cautionary tale. 

Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk of bad design has given me a headache. I believe I'll go recalibrate my CRT monitor and listen to some soothing modem sounds.  Keep up the good fight, but maybe... dial back the emojis just a tad? They're rather hard on these old eyes.
[A]: Awwww教授你太sweet了！！！🥺 我会keep the emoji usage... moderate（尽量啦😝） Promise我会send you那个"Client's Choice" font的beta version让你review～ 说不定还能成为你们department的legendary artifact呢！📚✨ 

Enjoy你的CRT monitor recalibration session哦！（虽然我totally don't get那种analog vibe但是respect！👴💻） Catch you later啦～ Keep being awesome！！！✌️
[B]:  Moderate... yes, we'll see about that. And do send that font along - if it's anything like my TA's creation, it might just earn a place in our "Hall of Typographic Shame" next to the infamous Wingdings thesis incident. 

Now off you go - I believe my 2400 baud modem is calling.  And do try to use proper punctuation next time. These old academic bones still appreciate a well-placed semicolon; they're the unsung heroes of written communication, you know. 

Good day, you rebellious young typographer. Try not to give your clients too much of a headache... save some for the rest of us. 
[A]: LOL教授你win了！！！😂 那个Wingdings thesis incident听起来超juicy的～ 下次coffee chat一定要tell me the tea☕️🍵 

Semicolons noted; will try to use them more often; just for you; (see what I did there? 😏) 

Ciao for now～ Catch you on the flip side of the digital divide!!! 💻➡️🖥️ 
[B]:  That semicolon abuse... why, it's enough to make a compiler weep. Though I must admit, it's marginally better than emoji punctuation. 

Very well - next time I'll share the Wingdings story, along with why we had to ban the use of Zapf Dingbats in academic papers after '93.  

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go yell at some PostScript code. And possibly my dot matrix printer.  Do try not to break the internet with your USB-C contraptions.
[A]: PFFFFFT 教授你简直是我的spirit animal！！！🤣🦉 Zapf Dingbats的drama听起来比任何Netflix show都juicy～ 我promise下次带artisanal coffee来bribe你讲这些typography war stories！！！☕️💣 

Don't worry我的USB-C gadgets都很well-behaved（mostly）～ 不过你的dot matrix printer可能需要一些anger management classes吧？😜 

TTYL啦～ Keep being the coolest professor ever！！！✌️ 
[B]:  Virtual hugs through TCP/IP... in my day, we sent proper RFC-compliant emoticons. And that dot matrix printer and I have an understanding - it pretends to work, and I pretend not to remember the 1987 incident with the tractor feed. 

Your artisanal coffee bribe is... acceptable. Though I'll expect proper kerning on the cup sleeve.  Now begone, you digital ne'er-do-well, before you give my PostScript interpreter performance anxiety. 

 And do look up RFC 2795 when you get a chance... it's about the proper implementation of emoticons. Some of us still believe in standards, you know.
