[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern dilemma of social media curation. While I appreciate Instagram's aesthetic pretensions - rather like the Victorian era's obsession with carefully arranged photograph albums - I must confess I find 小红书's focus on handwritten notes and calligraphy demonstrations far more intellectually stimulating. Though I do maintain an Instagram account solely to follow rare book auctions.
[A]: OMG！你居然把social media说得这么academic😂✨ 我平时两个app都用超多的！Instagram主要是post我的daily look和food pics📸 小红书的话就是share各种trendy的穿搭和美妆tips💄🔥 不过你说book auctions也太interesting了吧！我都是follow一些celebrity和influencer的账号～
[B]:  The term 'influencer' always reminds me of those 19th century literary salons where hostesses wielded considerable cultural capital - though I daresay Madame de Staël would be appalled at today's definition of influence being measured in likes and swipe-ups. As for celebrities... well, I suppose Lord Byron was the original influencer, wasn't he? Complete with scandalous behavior and carefully cultivated public image.
[A]: LMAO！你这种comparison也太wild了吧🤣 Byron要是活在现在绝对是个super viral的TikTok star💫 不过说真的，现在influencer的content确实有点too much了，有时候刷feed全是sponsored posts💰 我最近更爱看小红书里那些authentic的user-generated content，感觉更relatable一点～
[B]: How fascinating that you mention authenticity - this recalls the Chinese literati tradition of 文人画 (wénrén huà), where amateur scholars valued spontaneous expression over professional polish. Though I must say, the contemporary obsession with 'relatability' would have baffled both the Romantics and the Ming dynasty intellectuals. They prized cultivated refinement, not this... what do the young people call it? 'Keeping it real'? 
[A]: OMG stop！你每次都能把最简单的things说得这么deep😂💦 不过你这么一说，我post的videos确实有点too polished了，maybe应该try more casual的style？就像你说的keeping it real✨ 但是seriously，你平时真的不post任何content吗？Not even like...a food pic or something？🍜📸
[B]: My dear, the only 'content' I create are marginalia in first editions and the occasional conference paper. Though I did once photograph a particularly exquisite bowl of 阳春面 - but that was strictly for archival purposes in my research on culinary motifs in late Qing literature.  I suppose my idea of 'going viral' would be discovering an unknown manuscript draft.
[A]: Whaaaatttt???😱 That's like...the mostnerdy thing I've ever heard！But lowkey kinda cool though🔥 下次你发现什么ancient manuscript一定要第一时间DM我okay？I'll make it go viral on all mysocials📱💥 说不定还能get you somesponsorship deals frommuseum shops呢LOL！
[B]: The very notion of 'museum shop sponsorship' for textual scholarship makes me shudder like a Victorian matron encountering free verse poetry. Though I must admit, your enthusiasm for paleography is... unexpectedly refreshing. Very well, should I unearth a lost Cao Xueqin fragment, you shall be the first to receive a meticulously footnoted DM.  Though I draw the line at hashtags.
[A]: YASSSS！这就是why我爱跟你chat💯 你总是能make even the mostboring stuff sound exciting✨ 不过no hashtags？Seriously？#LostManuscript #AncientLit #ScholarVibes这些都不行吗？😭 算了，到时候我帮你sneak in几个trendy的tags，保证不会ruin你的aesthetic的啦～ 
[B]:  Your hashtag enthusiasm reminds me of the marginal glosses in medieval manuscripts - though at least those scribes had the decency to use Latin abbreviations. Very well, you may append your... digital graffiti... provided they're historically accurate. #枕霞旧友 would be acceptable for a Dream of the Red Chamber discovery, but absolutely no #BookTok. That's my final offer.
[A]: LOL deal！🤝 #枕霞旧友 sounds soaesthetic already✨ 我promise会make it the mostclassy的viral post ever📚💖 说不定还能start a newtrend叫#ScholarCore呢！Okayokay我知道你现在正在roll your eyes啦😂 但是trust me，这绝对会be bigger than #DarkAcademia！🔥
[B]:  Your #ScholarCore proposition is marginally less objectionable than that dreadful 'dark academia' aesthetic - though I maintain that true scholarship requires neither moody filters nor artfully arranged skull replicas. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to my 17th century inkwell collection before the curator at the Bodleian responds to my latest query about their Qing dynasty manuscript holdings. Without emojis, naturally.
[A]: Awwww fine～😔 但是before you go，just one lastthing！下次你来我的livestream讲讲那些cool manuscripts吧？I'll even let youwear your fancypince-nez！Promise it'll be supereducational and not at allcringe✨📚 不然我就要spam yourDMs with catmemes until youagree！😼💌
[B]: The threat of feline memes is indeed dire... though not as dire as the prospect of 'livestream pedagogy.' Tell you what - send me those cat memes via carrier pigeon on vellum parchment, and I might consider recording a dignified lecture on bamboo slip texts. But absolutely no 'react faces' or 'superchats.' Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition of 红楼梦 is giving me disapproving looks from the shelf.
[A]: Okayokay you win this round！🙌 我会stick to carrier pigeons andvellum（whatever that is😂）But don't think I'llgive up that easily！✨ 你的lecture一定会be fire once I get youon camera📸 #ComingSoon #WatchThisSpace #ScholarCoreRevolution 💥 Now go read yourprecious book before itgets mad at me too～ Byeeee！💖
[B]:  红楼梦 and I shall enjoy our hashtag-free evening with a pot of proper oolong. Do send that carrier pigeon by way of the university's clock tower - the one that chimes in iambic pentameter. Good day.  Or as you'd insist on typing: ~bye~ 💫 (there, I've debased myself with a single sparkle)
[A]: OMGGGG！！！Did you just...used an EMOJI？？？😱✨ This is like...the biggestcharacter development ever！！！💯 红楼梦must be shook right now😂 我马上screenshot this moment forposterity📸 #ScholarUsesEmoji #HistoricMoment #Progress 好啦好啦I'll let you enjoy yourtea time now～但这次convo绝对goes in myhighlight reel！Byeeee～💖💫
[B]:  That was merely a typographical flourish, not an endorsement of your digital hieroglyphics. Now if you'll excuse me, I must immediately burn some incense to appease the literary spirits I've undoubtedly offended. And for heaven's sake, do put that screenshot in whatever 'highlight reel' you please - just ensure my pince-nez is properly in focus. Farewell.  罢休.
