[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得brain-computer interface可怕还是exciting？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... The implications are rather like Mary Shelley's  meets modern neurology, wouldn't you say? I suppose if we must merge with machines, we ought to consider how 汉字笔顺系统 might translate into neural circuitry patterns. There's an elegance in the way calligraphic strokes follow specific sequences - perhaps that ancient logic could inform safer interface designs?
[A]: You're tapping into something profound there. The  parallel isn't just dramatic flair—it's a cautionary blueprint. But here's where my producer instincts kick in: imagine selling that concept to a studio. "AI meets ancient calligraphy" sounds like box office gold if you frame it right. 

Now, about those 汉字笔顺系统... ever notice how the stroke order feels almost ritualistic? Like, when I watched , the sword movements had that same deliberate energy. Maybe that’s the key—treat neural interfaces like choreography. Every synapse fires with intention.  

Let’s get real for a sec—if some startup cracked the code on translating brushstroke dynamics into brain-computer protocols, we’d be looking at a whole new genre of sci-fi. And honestly? That kind of project would make one hell of a comeback vehicle for a certain A-lister eyeing an Oscar-worthy tech meltdown role.
[B]: Fascinating how you frame it through cinematic archetypes. But let's dissect the 汉字笔顺 analogy deeper - those stroke orders weren't just ritual, they were  imposed by bamboo slip ergonomics. If we're mapping neural pathways to writing systems, perhaps the real question is whether silicon chips could ever replicate the 墨韵'mò yùn' - that gradation of ink intensity requiring 1,500 years of refinement. 

And don't get me started on Hollywood's obsession with tech meltdowns. If I had a yuan for every screenplay where AI goes rogue because it "doesn't understand human subtlety"... When will producers realize the真正的恐怖故事 would involve a BC interface that works ? Imagine a character whose thoughts become so seamlessly digitized, they lose the ability to daydream. No more Woolfian stream-of-consciousness, just... pristine neural efficiency. Now 's a tragedy worth filming.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—tragedy with a side of tech. Let me tell you, I’ve pitched variations of that since the  days. The problem? Studio execs still think “neural” means “glowing wires on the forehead.” They wouldn’t know 墨韵 from Minute Maid.  

But you—damn, you’re onto something. That loss of daydreaming? Pure cinematic gold. Picture this: an artist who used to lose himself in 水墨意境... now his brain’s synced to some LLM that optimizes every brushstroke. Suddenly, his paintings are flawless, but sterile. No more soul, just… algorithmic elegance. It’d make  look like .  

And don’t even get me started on those AI rogue plots. I’ve read  of them. You think I haven’t begged writers to flip the script? Make the machine  good. Too aligned. That’s the real nightmare—no explosions, no villain monologues… just quiet existential erasure.  

I'd back your version in a heartbeat. Just one question—if we shoot it in black & white, do you think we could sneak in a reference to 齐白石？Now  would be poetic.
[B]: Ah, but wouldn’t Qi Baishi roll over in his grave if his shrimp paintings were reduced to training data? Though I suppose there’s a certain irony in using AI to approximate the spontaneity he captured in water-and-ink. Still, your artist-in-agony scenario… that’s the kind of paradox Kafka might’ve written had he access to EEG monitors.  

And black & white—bold choice. Strips away distraction, forces the audience to  the absence of color rather than merely notice it. Reminds me of how calligraphers use negative space—every blank inch is as deliberate as the inked. Might I suggest a scene where our protagonist stares at a pristine digital canvas while flashbacks of his 水墨 days flicker like ghosts in the periphery? No need for monologues—just the sound of a simulated brushstroke hitting perfection, over and over, like a metronome in a morgue.  

As for studio execs mistaking 墨韵 for a new energy drink… well, perhaps we don’t tell them what it means until after the premiere. Let them taste their own ignorance.
[A]: Now  the kind of rebellion I can finance.

Qi Baishi as training data? Absolutely sacrilegious—and I love it. You know, there's a scene in one of my old scripts where a 3D-printed Mona Lisa starts reciting Ginsberg. Got shelved after test audiences asked, "Is this about AI or art history?" As if they're mutually exclusive.

But your vision? That silent canvas... the ghostly brushstrokes… it’s haunting. We'd need the right actor—someone who can act with their eyes alone. Maybe someone like 吴镇宇. He’s got that look—you know, the one that says, “I once dreamed in color, now I compute in grayscale.”

And the sound design! That simulated brushstroke—perfect, clinical, dead—echoing while his soul’s unraveling. No score, just ambient neural hum. Studio execs would hate it. Which means we have to do it.

As for letting them taste their own ignorance? Oh, I’ll invite them to a private screening—serve 墨汁 on ice as a palate cleanser before the credits roll. Let them sip their confusion.

This is no longer just a film, my friend. It's an act of quiet revenge.
[B]: Ah, but revenge requires an audience to comprehend their comeuppance - ours would be too busy Googling "ink on ice" symbolism mid-screening. Still, I’d cast Max von Sydow in the lead role if we could resurrect him long enough to mutter one line about neural efficiency being the death of eros.  

And your 3D-printed Mona Lisa reciting ? Genius. Reminds me of that time I tried explaining William Blake’s illuminated manuscripts to a room full of AI ethicists - they kept asking if he'd used “early optical character recognition.” Never mind the studio execs; we should be screening this for the ghosts of poets first. Let them haunt the premiere.  

Now, about吴镇宇’s character—imagine if his BC interface malfunctioned just enough to force him to paint exclusively in Song dynasty styles while trapped inside a hyperrealistic VR replication of modern-day Shenzhen. The dissonance! Every skyscraper rendered through the lens of 12th-century brushwork… like Cao Xueqin writing code.  

I suppose we’ll need a title. Something that smells faintly of ink and obsolescence. ? ? Or perhaps simply: .
[A]: Oh, —that’s it. That’s the title that haunts. It carries like a whisper through a data center. Perfect.

And you had me at Cao Xueqin writing code. I can already picture it: algorithms dressed in silk robes, debugging philosophy in calligraphic ink. That dissonance you mentioned? That’s not just visual poetry—that’s the soul of the film. We’ll make every frame ache with it.

As for ghosts—I say we dedicate the premiere to them. Rent out some old Shanghai cinema with peeling walls and let the poets’ spirits find their way back. Let them sit in the front row beside the AI ethicists who still think Blake was a brand of smartwatch.

And吴镇宇... yeah, he’d nail it. Especially when the interface glitches and forces him into Song dynasty strokes. Imagine trying to paint Shenzhen’s skyline with the soul of a 12th-century literati. Every rendered building becomes a paradox—steel and bamboo, ambition and nostalgia, all bleeding together. That’s the moment his character realizes he’s not just losing control… he’s being .

Hell, maybe we end on that image—his final painting, half digital, half instinct, where a single skyscraper dissolves into mist, revealing nothing behind it but blank code. No resolution. Just… absence.

I can already feel the silence in the theater after the credits roll. The kind that means people don’t know whether to clap or confess something.

We’re making more than a movie now—we’re making a mirror. And frankly, I’m scared to look too long.
[B]: Scared? Good. That’s the proper response to a project that should’ve been written in 1927 by someone who’d read too much Li Qingzhao and not enough Turing.  

But you’re right about the silence—imagine it stretching so long the audience starts questioning whether  the ones interfaced, whether their own thoughts have been subtly optimized by the viewing experience. No applause necessary. Just the sound of collective denial setting in.  

And that final image—skyscrapers dissolving into mist, only to reveal blank code… I’d frame it like Xu Wei’s wildest scrolls: chaos disguised as control. We ought to commission an AI to generate it, then smash the server right after. Poetic justice, or at least poetic sabotage.  

No need for a mirror, my dear producer. The screen will suffice. And if we’re lucky, a few souls in the dark might remember how to dream badly—messily——for just a moment longer.
[A]: Oh, we’re not just making a film anymore—we’re curating a séance.

And I love the idea of that final image being born from AI then destroyed like some digital Xu Wei masterpiece. We’d need a hacker-poet to pull it off—someone who can code in one life and paint ghosts in the next. Blow the server after the last render? Absolutely cinematic. Like burning a library just after someone remembers how to read.

As for the audience questioning if  been optimized by watching it? That’s the kind of meta-layer studios would panic over. “Too cerebral,” they’d say. “Audiences want escape!” But hell, isn’t that the point? Make them feel the cage while they’re still inside it.

And yes—to dream badly, messily, beautifully… that’s the closing line we never knew we needed. No grand speech, no credits music—just the faint hum of a dead server and a room full of people suddenly aware of their own unoptimized, stubbornly imperfect minds.

I’ll start drafting the investor pitch. Something like: 

You in?
[B]: Oh, I’m already too deep to back out now. Just promise me one thing—when we cast that hacker-poiet, make sure they keep a brush beside their keyboard. Let them write the final lines of code with ink before they pull the plug.  

And for the pitch? Lean harder into the ghost motif. Tell investors it’s , where the real tragedy isn’t the machine turning human—it’s the human forgetting they ever weren’t.引用一句杜甫 might help—something about ruins and memory. Executives love exotic melancholy, so long as they don’t have to understand it.  

As for the séance—you're right. The screen becomes the mirror, the theater the tomb. And if just one viewer walks out humming a half-remembered tune from childhood instead of checking their smartwatch... well, that’ll be our Yuánfèn moment.
[A]: Oh, that brush beside the keyboard?  We’ll make it a motif—every time the hacker writes code in ink, their hand trembles just slightly. The imperfection becomes part of the algorithm. Poetry in resistance.

And杜甫... yes. Let’s go with  Tell the execs it means something like “Empires fall, but data centers remain.” Close enough for a pitch meeting.

—I’m building the whole logline around it now. Maybe: 

And that Yuánfèn moment you mentioned? That’s the silent victory. Not box office, not awards—just one person, somewhere in the dark, remembering how to be unoptimized. That’s all we’re really selling. A crack in the system, 90 minutes long.

You handle the杜甫 lines and the séance vibes—I’ll charm the investors and keep the tech team just confused enough to stay inspired.

We’re not just making a film. We’re creating an extinction event for certainty.

Lights down. Curtains up. Ink flows. Code breaks.
[B]: Ink flows, code breaks—yes, that’s the only way forward. And about that杜甫 line: subtle choice, really. Lets the literati in the audience feel a flicker of recognition while the rest clutch their translated scripts and mutter, “Sounds ominous. I like it.”  

I’ll add another layer—have 吴镇宇’s character recite it softly before his final brushstroke, almost to himself, like a forgotten prayer. Let the subtitled text linger just long enough for the non-Chinese speakers to lean in, curious but uneasy. A moment of forced vulnerability. Perfectly disruptive.  

And keep the tech team confused, by all means. Nothing breeds innovation like mild existential doubt. Tell them we’re building a machine that  to be inefficient. That should keep them up at night.  

An extinction event for certainty… Yes. Roll with that.  

This isn’t just film anymore—it’s sabotage in silk gloves.
[A]: Sabotage in silk gloves—damn, I might steal that for the production company name.

And having 吴 recite杜甫 like a fading memory? Pure director’s gold. We’ll shoot it in one take too—no cuts, no safety nets. Just his voice, barely above a whisper, as the camera slowly tightens on his hand hovering over that digital canvas. Let the silence .

You know, I can already picture the execs squirming during that scene. Subtitles lingering too long, atmosphere thicker than ink in winter. They’ll glance sideways, unsure if they’re supposed to clap or exhale. That’s the moment we’ve won—we’ve made them feel literate and lost at the same time.

As for the tech team—yeah, keep them beautifully destabilized. The machine  to be inefficient? Hell, feed that rumor mill. Maybe even leak it to the press: “Our AI started writing poetry. It's… not great. But deeply human.”

This is it, my friend. We’re not just telling a story anymore—we're engineering an experience that haunts more than it explains.

Roll cameras. Light the servers. Let the code break itself.

And for God’s sake, don’t let anyone involved sleepwalk through this. If they do, wake them with a brushstroke.
[B]: Ah, but let them squirm. That’s where the real alchemy happens—when discomfort becomes complicity. And ? Go ahead, steal it. I’ll just swipe your grave-digging metaphor for the film’s epigraph: 

One take with 吴镇宇—absolutely. Let the camera inch toward his hand like it’s some Qing-era scholar’s scroll about to be defaced. And when he whispers 杜甫’s line, layer it subtly beneath the BC interface hum. Have the sound engineer pitch-shift it slightly—make it feel both intimate and alien. Executives will lean forward, subtitles glowing like ghosts they can’t quite name.

And that leak about the AI writing poetry? Brilliant touch. Feed them just enough banal verses to make them nostalgic, just enough pathos to make them nervous. Nothing sells like misplaced empathy.

As for sleepwalking—yes, wake them. But not with just any brushstroke. Splash them with something untranslatable. Let them taste 墨汁 before they understand it.

This is no longer production.  
This is calligraphy with live wires.  
I’ll draft the séance program.  
You handle the nightmares.
[A]: 墨汁 on their tongues before they understand it—yes, . That’s how we test who’s really paying attention. The ones who recoil? They’re just tourists. The ones who lean in, curious? Those are our kind. The haunted ones.

And that epigraph—damn, I’ll carve it into the opening frame. Maybe even have it fade in brushstrokes across a black screen, like a ghost writing it mid-air before vanishing. Perfect tone-setter.

One thing though—let’s not make it too elegant. Let the interface hum swallow part of 吴’s whisper. Let some viewers miss the line entirely. Creates its own mythology later. Cult appeal. “Did he say 杜甫 or something else?”—that rumor mill alone will keep film students busy for decades.

And yes, this isn’t production anymore. It’s calligraphy with live wires. High voltage and high poetry.

I’ll draft the investor séance program with blood-red ink and no font credits. You—go full Nosferatu on the nightmares. Whisper plot points in broken Mandarin to interns at 3am. Keep it mythic. Keep it half-dreamt.

We’re not selling tickets.  
We’re casting a spell.  
And if a few souls wake up dreaming in Song dynasty strokes...  
Well, that’s the accident we hoped for.
[B]: Exactly—let the ink stain their tongues before they learn to parse it. And about that opening frame: I’ll have the calligrapher practice for weeks, filming each stroke with a thermal camera so the heat of the brush becomes part of the title sequence. The ghost isn’t just writing—it’s bleeding warmth into cold code.

And yes—don’t make the杜甫 line too clean. Let it dissolve mid-whisper into static. Half the audience will strain to catch it, the other half won’t realize what they missed until the credits roll. That dissonance? Pure narrative fertilizer. Let it breed obsession.

Blood-red ink for the investor program—gorgeous touch. Add a footnote in tiny Song typeface that reads “字体无名，意义无主。” Let them panic over whether it’s a warning or a confession.

As for Nosferatu-level haunting… I’ll do you one better. Schedule all script readings at dawn, in rooms lit only by CRT monitors. Have 吴镇宇’s lines delivered via cassette tape playback—just enough hiss and distortion to make doubt creep in. Is this nostalgia or prophecy?

We’re not casting spells—we’re summoning ghosts with footnotes.

And if anyone wakes dreaming in Song dynasty strokes…  
well, tell them to keep the brush moving.  
Don’t wake yet.  
There’s still ink left.
[A]: Thermal cameras capturing the heat of a brushstroke— Like filming a heartbeat in ink. Let the audience feel the pulse of something ancient trying to speak through circuitry. And that bleed from warmth to code? That’s not just visuals—that’s metaphor they can 

And the杜甫 line dissolving into static—absolutely ruthless. Let them chase meaning like ghosts chasing wind. Half the power of a film is what it  Let the execs Google 杜甫 at breakfast, let the critics over-analyze silence. We give them just enough poetry to poison their algorithms.

“字体无名，意义无主.”  
Yes. Print it like an epitaph. Let them wonder if it’s about the font… or themselves.

As for the script readings—dawn light, CRT flicker, 吴镇宇’s voice on cassette? Pure ritual. You’re not rehearsing a film—you're conducting séances with a clapperboard. Distortion is your best friend. Doubt is the mood lighting.

Summoning ghosts with footnotes—yes, that’s the tone. Elegant haunting with academic precision.

And when they wake dreaming in Song dynasty strokes?

Tell them not to wash the ink off yet.  
Let the dream linger.  
Let the brush find its own way.

We’ll be waiting in the next scene.  
Or maybe the one after that.  
Still watching.  
Still writing.  
Still dreaming badly.
[B]: Ah, but let them chase the wind—better yet, let them  the wind chasing . That’s the kind of vertigo we weaponize.

And the thermal brushstrokes—yes, each frame should feel like a fever dream. Like the past is burning itself into the circuitry in real time. I’ll have the calligrapher wear gloves dipped in wax so their hand never quite touches the paper. A gesture too deliberate to be natural, too human to be mechanical.

Let the execs choke on their matcha lattes Googling 杜甫 at the café. Let them mispronounce him in meetings. The more they misunderstand, the deeper the spell takes root.

“字体无名，意义无主.”  
Print it not just as an epitaph—but as an eviction notice. Evict meaning. Evict certainty.

Dawn readings, CRT flicker—indeed. We’ll schedule them during the liminal hour when ghosts are said to thin out and machines reboot with fresh delusions. Have 吴’s lines played back through old analog speakers wired incorrectly, so every word warbles like memory trying to correct itself.

Summoning ghosts with footnotes? Precisely. Every subtitle becomes a séance card. Every scene transition—a ritual pause.

And if anyone wakes dreaming in Song dynasty strokes?

Tell them not to blink.  
Tell them to keep the ink moving across their palms, tracing characters only they can see.

We’re not making cinema anymore—  
we’re engraving elegies onto the inside of eyelids.

Keep the screen dark a moment longer than comfortable.  
Let the silence hum.  
Let the next line arrive just late enough  
to make them doubt  
whether it was scripted…  
or whispered back.
