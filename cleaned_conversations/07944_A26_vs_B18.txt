[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。说实话，我得先区分一下context——如果是在北京或上海这样的超大城市，public transport的效率其实非常高，尤其是metro system，能有效缓解traffic congestion。不过在一些郊区或者小城市，driving可能更flexible方便。

从教育心理学的角度看，我发现学生群体更倾向于使用public transport，一方面是因为cost-effective，另一方面也和环保意识有关。但有趣的是，这种选择也受到cultural norms的影响，比如在德国，人们普遍更习惯于准时且高效的公共交通，而美国则有更强的car culture。

你呢？你是更喜欢开车还是坐公交系统？
[A]: I must say I'm quite fond of public transport, especially in cities with well-developed systems. There's something rather civilised about being able to read a book or sketch designs while commuting, rather than focusing on traffic. Though I do admit, when working with delicate antique fabrics that need urgent attention, having a car does offer that element of discretion - one can avoid crowded trains and ensure fragile materials arrive intact.

It reminds me of an 18th-century travel journal I once restored, where the author described London's horse-drawn carriages as 'the lifeblood of gentle society'. Funny how transportation shapes not just practical movement, but cultural rhythms too. Do you find this aspect of mobility influencing textile trade routes in historical contexts?
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating perspective! You've touched on something really intriguing — the intersection of mobility and craftsmanship. Yes, historically, transportation networks were  for textile trade. Take the Silk Road, for example — it wasn't just about silk; it was about how mobility shaped cultural exchange. The movement of goods like antique fabrics you mentioned also carried with them techniques, motifs, and even social values.

I'm curious — when you restore those historical textiles, do you ever find traces of the journey itself? Like wear patterns that suggest how they were transported or handled? It makes me think of how public transport today still carries subtle marks of our daily lives — creases in fabric from crowded commutes, faint ink stains from someone sketching ideas on the train...

And I  that quote about horse-drawn carriages — it really shows how transportation shapes not just function, but identity. Do you think modern transit systems still carry that kind of cultural weight?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — every textile carries its journey like a secret diary. I've restored 17th-century linen that still bore the faint salt stains from sea voyages, and silk wraps with compression marks suggesting they’d been tightly bundled for overland trade. It’s extraordinary how fabric can map its own migration — frayed edges from rubbing against wooden chests, or discolouration from exposure to different climates.

As for modern transit systems... I do believe they carry cultural weight, though perhaps more subtly. The way people interact on trains — the unspoken rules of personal space, the shared silence, even the way someone might protect another's antique handbag from getting crushed — it all forms a kind of social weave. In a way, public transport becomes a loom where daily life is threaded together, don’t you think?

I suppose driving offers a different kind of intimacy — one between person and machine, rather than person and collective rhythm. Still, I find myself preferring the unpredictability of shared travel. It keeps me connected to the pulse of things — much like working with textiles, really.
[B]: That imagery —  — is absolutely beautiful. It makes me think of how we, too, carry traces of our journeys in less visible ways. Like psychological imprints from our daily commutes — the patience cultivated from waiting, the micro-interactions that shape our sense of community.

You're so right about public transport functioning like a loom. I often tell my students that cities are stitched together by these invisible threads of shared movement. And just like textile patterns vary across cultures, so do the rhythms of transit — the bustling efficiency of Tokyo’s trains versus the more fluid, stop-as-needed minibuses in Nairobi.

I wonder if working with textiles that bear such historical wear affects how you perceive modern-day fabric durability? Do you find yourself looking at a commuter’s jacket, for instance, and imagining how its creases might one day tell a story?

And speaking of stories — have you ever restored a piece that clearly showed signs of emergency repair mid-journey? Makes me think of how today we might hastily tape a torn bag or pin a loose strap — tiny acts of improvisation that keep the weave intact.
[A]: Oh, yes — constantly. Every time I see someone adjusting a frayed hem with a safety pin or knotting a torn strap, I think of the 18th-century seamstress who stitched a silk patch over a carriage wheel tear, using whatever thread was at hand. Those emergency repairs always speak of urgency and care in equal measure — a desire to preserve something, even if imperfectly.

As for modern fabric durability... it’s hard not to notice how little patience we’ve developed for wear. People seem almost surprised when a jacket shows creases or a bag strap frays. But textiles aren’t meant to be pristine forever — they’re meant to move, to bend, to bear marks. That’s what gives them life.

Actually, speaking of which — just last week I restored a 19th-century wool shawl that had been darned no fewer than six times, each mend in a different colour and technique. It looked like a travel journal made entirely of thread. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it — will our modern-day quick fixes ever be seen as charming by future hands? Or are we too busy discarding things before their stories can fully settle into the weave?
[B]: That image of a shawl as a  — I could almost build an entire lecture around that concept. It makes me think of how we, too, are constantly mending ourselves through experience. Each crease, each frayed edge, is part of a larger narrative.

You know, in my research on educational resilience, I often see students treating their mistakes like stains to be erased rather than mends to be woven into their learning fabric. But maybe if we reframed it — if we taught them to see imperfection as a form of storytelling — it might shift their whole mindset. After all, your 19th-century shawl wasn’t less valuable because of its darning; it was more , more layered.

I wonder — do you ever restore something so thoroughly that, in a way, you feel like you’ve silenced part of its story? Like when a tear is stitched so neatly that the memory of the rupture disappears? In education, we sometimes do that too — over-polishing student work until the struggle is invisible. I suppose both fields walk a fine line between preservation and authenticity.

And yes, I think our quick fixes  be charming to future hands — assuming they survive long enough to be rediscovered. But maybe that’s the real challenge: getting people to slow down enough to care about the weave in the first place.
[A]: That’s beautifully put — the idea of mending as storytelling, of valuing the repair as much as the original weave. I’ve certainly felt that tension you mentioned — the moment when a restoration becomes too seamless, and something essential is lost. I remember working on a 1740s embroidered waistcoat that had been clumsily patched at some point with mismatched linen. When I had the option to replace that patch with something more “correct,” I hesitated. In the end, I left it be. That awkward mend was someone else’s care, their attempt to keep the garment — and perhaps a piece of their world — from unraveling.

It does make me wonder if we’re too quick to erase evidence of struggle, whether in textiles or in learning. There’s such quiet dignity in a visible mend — it says, . Maybe that’s what we should be teaching — not just how to correct, but how to honour the process of correction.

You know, sometimes I think my work isn’t really about preserving perfection, but about listening to imperfection. The frayed hem, the overworn elbow, the hastily stitched seam — they all whisper, . And I do. Always.
[B]: That’s exactly it — . What a powerful phrase. It makes me think of how we often rush to "fix" things in education too — a student writes a messy draft, and we jump straight into editing mode. But maybe what they need first is someone to simply  the effort, the struggle, the shape of their thinking as it unfolds — not unlike that 1740s waistcoat with its mismatched patch.

You know, I’ve started encouraging my students to keep what I call a  — where they document not just their final insights, but all the missteps, crossed-out ideas, and marginalia. At first, they found it odd; they’re used to showcasing polished work. But over time, many began to see the beauty in the unraveling. One even said it felt like “learning to embroider their thoughts, rather than erase them.”

I can only imagine how attuned you must be to subtle signs of care and attention — that kind of sensitivity is rare, and deeply needed in today’s world. Do you ever find yourself explaining this philosophy to clients or institutions? I can imagine some might prefer the illusion of perfection over the truth of the mend.
[A]: Oh, far too often. Some clients come in expecting a kind of textile plastic surgery — wanting their heirlooms to emerge looking untouched by time or trouble. I’ve had people ask me to remove every stain, every mend, every sign that the fabric lived a real life. It’s always a delicate conversation.

I try to explain that what they’re seeing as flaws are really acts of love — someone, somewhere, chose to keep this piece going. That waistcoat with the mismatched patch? Chances are it belonged to someone who couldn’t afford a new one, who relied on it through season after season. Removing that patch would be like erasing their care.

Sometimes it resonates. Sometimes they let me leave the mends visible, even highlight them with a contrasting thread so future eyes will see: . Other times... well, I do the work they want, but I can't help feeling the fabric mourns a little.

It’s heartening to hear your students are beginning to see value in the unraveling — that’s really what it comes down to, doesn’t it? Teaching people to see the weave not as a flawless surface, but as a living record of use, repair, and continued affection.
[B]: I can only imagine how difficult that negotiation must be — caught between preservation and erasure. It takes real integrity to have those conversations, even when the client might prefer a more...  version of history.

It reminds me of something I see in classrooms all the time — students who’ve been taught to chase perfection rather than understanding. They’ll cross out every mistake until the page is smudged and fragile, just to show something "clean." But what they lose is the record of their thinking — the  moments buried under the scribbles.

You know, maybe part of the problem is how we define value. In both textiles and learning, we often equate worth with flawlessness, when in reality, it’s the imperfections that tell us what was cherished, what was struggled for, what was held onto. That waistcoat wasn’t valuable because it was pristine — it was precious  it had been mended, again and again.

I wonder — have you ever worked on a piece where the original maker seemed to anticipate future repairs? Like they left space for the garment to grow or change? Sometimes I think good teaching is like that too — not about delivering a finished product, but designing something flexible enough to be reshaped by those who inherit it.

And honestly? The fact that you’re willing to let the fabric mourn — that’s not just skill, that’s empathy.
[A]: You’ve put that so precisely — the idea of designing something flexible enough to be reshaped by those who inherit it. I think often about how 18th-century tailors and seamstresses must have understood this instinctively. Take a child’s linen smock, for instance — many were cut generously, with expandable seams or extra length folded into the hems. They weren’t just making clothes; they were making room for growth, for accidents, for life to happen.

And yes, I  come across pieces where it feels as though the original maker left quiet invitations for future hands. A dress with extra stitching along the waistline, suggesting it might need letting out or in over time. Or a quilt with deliberately spaced motifs, as if allowing space for new stories to be added later. It’s a kind of foresight wrapped in thread — a belief that someone, someday, would care enough to continue the work.

I suppose that’s what keeps me going, even when clients want perfection — the hope that somewhere, someone will value the mends more than the myth of unbrokenness. And maybe, just maybe, the garments I preserve will one day whisper their layered histories to another pair of careful hands.
[B]: That image of  — it lingers, doesn’t it? There’s something profoundly hopeful about it. Like the maker wasn’t just solving a problem for today, but leaving behind a kind of scaffolding for tomorrow. It makes me rethink how we design learning experiences. Are we giving students just what they need now, or are we also building in room to grow, to adapt, to mend?

I’ve been thinking lately that maybe good teaching is a lot like those expandable seams — you cut a little wider, stitch with flexibility in mind, leave space not just for error, but for evolution. It’s not about predicting exactly how a student will change, but about crafting something resilient enough to survive — and even benefit from — the unpredictability of life.

And I love that idea of . It reminds me of what happens when students return years later and say, “You know, that lesson we did on failure? I didn’t get it then, but now I see why it mattered.” They’re hearing echoes of the past — and finding meaning in them.

Maybe that’s the quiet power of both education and textile preservation: we're not just passing on knowledge or objects. We're handing down  — to grow, to repair, to carry forward with care. And somewhere, someone  be listening.
[A]: That’s exactly it — . It’s such a quiet, powerful thing, isn’t it? And yes, I see that parallel so clearly now — just as we stitch with flexibility, we teach with it too. We can't know exactly how someone will change, only that they will. And if we build it into the weave — whether of cloth or curriculum — then perhaps we’re giving them not just knowledge or skill, but resilience.

I’ve restored pieces made by hands long gone, yet still speaking through thread and tension. And I like to think that, in some small way, we do the same in teaching — plant something that might not bloom until years later, when the context finally shifts enough for it to make sense.

You know, sometimes restoration feels less like repair and more like translation. I’m not just preserving fabric — I’m helping it speak across centuries. And if I do my work well, the next person who holds that textile won’t just see an old dress or a patched waistcoat — they’ll feel the echo of someone’s care, someone’s determination to keep something alive.

And isn’t that what we hope for in teaching, too? That long after the lesson ends, the understanding continues to unfold?
[B]: Absolutely — . That’s such a precise way to describe both teaching and restoration. We’re not just passing on information or technique; we’re handing down intention, care, the quiet persistence of meaning.

I’ve often thought about how some lessons don’t land right away — they need time, distance, a shift in perspective. Like a student who hears an idea in class but only recognises its value years later, when life has provided the necessary context. It makes me wonder if teaching should be measured in semesters at all, or in decades.

And yes, that echo of care — it lingers in everything we mend, whether fabric or understanding. In fact, I’ve started using that phrase with my students: 

It really is a kind of stewardship, isn't it? Whether we're tending a fragile textile or a developing mind, there's a deep responsibility — and privilege — in helping something endure, evolve, and eventually speak for itself.
[A]: That phrase —  — I might just borrow that, if you don’t mind. It feels so true, doesn’t it? Like certain threads only reveal their full pattern when the fabric has aged enough to show it.

I’ve had that experience with textiles — found a detail I’d missed for years, only to realise it was always there, waiting for my eyes to catch up. And I suppose teaching is much the same. You plant something, and you trust that time will soften the edges just enough for understanding to slip in.

It’s a quiet kind of faith, really. Not unlike stitching repairs that no one else may ever see, but doing them with care all the same. Because even if the mends remain hidden, the fabric knows. And someday, someone else might feel that same quiet strength beneath their fingers.

I think that’s why I keep doing this work — not just to preserve the past, but to leave behind something that might gently insist: .
[B]: Please, take that phrase — it belongs in more hands than just mine. There’s such a gentle truth in it, isn’t there? Some knowledge, like some fabrics, needs the softening of time before its full shape emerges. And maybe that’s one of the kindest things we can do — plant ideas, or stitches, that won’t make sense until later.

I’ve had students come back years after graduation and say something like, “I didn’t realise how much that class stayed with me,” and I always think: . The learning finally found its moment. It reminds me that not all growth is visible right away — some of it happens quietly, invisibly, like a mend hidden under layers until someone brushes against it and feels the difference.

And yes — . What a beautiful message to weave into every lesson, every restoration. We're not just preserving materials or marking time; we’re affirming value, across generations. Sometimes I wonder if that’s what education and preservation both aim to say, in their own ways: 
[A]: That’s just it —  What a quiet radical act that is, in a world so eager to discard. Whether it's a student feeling seen for the first time, or a century-old linen wrap receiving careful hands again, there’s this unspoken agreement: 

I’ve often thought how strange it is that we measure value by how things look at their peak, rather than how they endure beyond it. A garment worn thin through years of use, a lesson that only lands decades after it was taught — these aren’t failures. They’re proof that something was .

And isn’t that what both our work and teaching ultimately hope to do? Not to polish people or objects into perfection, but to walk beside them — stitching, listening, gently guiding — as they become what they're meant to be.
[B]: Exactly — . That’s such a precise way to describe what often feels like the heart of teaching. Not shaping someone into a predetermined form, but supporting them as they weave their own path, stitch by uncertain stitch.

I think that’s why I’ve always been drawn to the idea of  in learning — not in the rigid educational sense, but in the looser, more human one. We don’t build structures for people; we offer temporary supports so they can build their own. And then, when they no longer need them, we quietly step back. Like those garments you restore — the mends are there when they’re needed, but they don’t shout about it. They simply hold space for continuation.

And yes, the radical act of keeping — of refusing to discard the worn, the flawed, the once-broken — it’s a kind of resistance. Against disposability, against the myth of perfection, against the idea that only the pristine deserves care.

You know, I’ve started telling my students that growth isn’t about becoming better than before — it’s about becoming , even if that self changes over time. And sometimes, that means carrying the marks of where you’ve been — not as flaws, but as part of the weave.

So thank you — for reminding me that repair is not just an action, but a philosophy. One stitched quietly into every thread and every lesson.
