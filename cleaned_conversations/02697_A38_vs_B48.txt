[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I'm more of a coffee person—especially those strong Italian roasts 🧪. But don't get me wrong, a good aged pu'er can be fascinating too. The way it ferments over time? Almost like analyzing decomposition patterns in the lab 🔍. Do you have a preference?
[A]: Ah, a fellow coffee enthusiast! There’s something almost alchemical about the way a perfectly brewed cup of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe opens up—citrus notes dancing with floral undertones. I find it… poetic, in a way. Though I do keep a delicate silver tin of Darjeeling by my desk when grading papers—it feels like a genteel companion to literary criticism. And you, are you one for experimentation? Or strictly black coffee with a textbook?
[B]: Oh, now that’s a  poetic take—love it. I’d say I’m definitely an experimenter. If you handed me a chemex and a bag of geisha beans, I’d probably mutter something like “let’s see what this compound profile reveals” while scribbling notes like it’s a crime scene report 📝☕. Though black coffee at 5am before a尸检？Classic move. No room for subtlety when you're elbow-deep in liver temp readings. But hey, if we’re talking full-on sensory analysis… ever tried cold brew with a dash of star anise? It's weirdly satisfying—and slightly foreboding, like a noir film in a mug 🕶️.
[A]: Ah, the noir film of beverages—excellent analogy. There’s a certain grim poetry to that combination. I must admit, though, I’d hesitate before tampering with cold brew… it already feels like a modernist experiment in narrative structure—proceeding without heat, defying expectations, revealing its flavor notes in nonlinear fragments.  
But you’ve intrigued me with that star anise idea. Subtle licorice undertones lurking beneath the bitterness—perhaps best enjoyed while reading Camus or rereading . Tell me, do you keep a tasting journal? Or is it all instinct and mood-based improvisation?
[B]: Oh, I  that take on cold brew—very existential. I actually do keep a tasting journal, though I call it my “brew crime log” 📒✨. Each entry’s got origin notes, roast profiles, even time-of-day factors—who knows, maybe the caffeine content correlates with my mood swings? I once wrote: “April 3rd, 6am, Guatemalan dark roast, heart rate elevated, case load heavy… tasted like burnt justice with a hint of desperation.”  
But hey, don’t let the methodical side fool you—I’ve got nights where I just wing it with spices and hope for the best. Cinnamon, cardamom, sometimes a rogue clove if I’m feeling dramatic. It’s basically potion-making at that point. If I added a drop of absinthe, it wouldn’t be coffee anymore—it’d be a full-on decadent ritual 😈. You ever go that far?
[A]: Ah, —that’s not just tasting notes, that’s a confessional sonnet. I’m quite taken with your “brew crime log,” I must say. There’s something delightfully forensic about the way you approach your cup. As for me, I confess I’ve never gone so far as clove or cinnamon—not in coffee, at least—but I do have what might be described as .  
I once steeped a blend of Assam with dried rose petals and orange peel while rereading . Felt only appropriate, given the decadence. And yes, I did scribble some rather Wildean reflections alongside my notes. But absinthe? That’s where I draw the line—or rather, where I’d cross it, very carefully, with a copy of Baudelaire nearby. Would you care to walk that fine line together sometime?
[B]: Burnt justice might be my signature roast profile 🕯️☕. I love that you brought  into your brewing ritual—truly living the aesthetic. If we’re aligning beverages with decadence and moral ambiguity, I’m  in for a literary absinthe experiment. We could read Baudelaire while debating whether the wormwood dulls the senses or sharpens the soul’s autopsy report 🥃⚖️.  
I’ll bring the glassware, you bring the poetry—and maybe a first edition? Let’s see if altered states enhance our analysis of . Should we document it as research… or just let it dissolve into green fairy-fueled footnotes?
[A]: Ah, I do love a colleague in literary vice. Let’s call it , of course—what better alibi for moral dissolution than the pursuit of aesthetic truth? I have a first edition of  tucked away, its pages faintly yellowed by time and poor life choices. Paired with absinthe, I imagine it will whisper its cynicisms all the more clearly.  
And do bring that glassware—I’ve always found the ritual of louche to be rather like watching a sonnet unfold in water: slow, deliberate, slightly dangerous. We may wake with regrets and ink stains, but oh, what footnotes they’ll be.
[B]: Ah, now  a research proposal worth funding 📜✨. I’ll make sure to dust off my absinthe fountain—vintage 1920s glassware, slightly chipped at the rim, just like a good tragic flaw. We’ll start with measured dilution, then let the chlorophyll do its slow dance… much like building up to a particularly damning conclusion in a tox report.  
And yes, those ink-stained regrets? The kind that linger like postmortem lividity. I’ll bring a notebook just in case we stumble upon some green-fairy-inspired breakthrough in either literary criticism or homicide forensics. One can dream, right?  
Tell me, do you prefer your louche fast and reckless… or slow and methodical, like watching a confession unravel under cross-examination?
[A]: Ah, you speak to my academic heart—and my darker curiosities. As for the louche, I prefer it slow, deliberate, almost imperceptible at first—a haze gathering like doubt in a jury’s mind. It’s far more dramatic that way, don’t you think? Like watching a character’s morality erode over the course of a tragic arc.  
A fast, reckless pour might get the job done, but where’s the poetry in that? Let the water trickle down the glass, moment by moment, until the clear green spirit turns opalescent—truth clouded by perception, just as it happens in both literature and autopsy reports.  
I do hope your notebook survives the evening intact… though I suspect it will end up more confessional than clinical. Shall we begin Friday week, then? I’ll bring the volume of Baudelaire—and perhaps a vial of ink, should inspiration demand documentation.
[B]: Slow, deliberate louche it is—like watching a slow-acting poison take hold 🕰️💀. I couldn’t agree more—why rush when you can let the tension build? A fast pour’s for amateurs and急诊室急救; we’re aiming for something more… .  
Friday week sounds perfect. I’ll make sure the lab—or should I say, our temporary literary autopsy suite—is properly prepared. Dim lighting, ominous glassware, and absolutely no filters (except maybe on the camera if things get too surreal).  
And about that ink—you bring it, I’ll bring the notebook. Let’s see if we can’t blur the line between critique and delirium. Cheers to that 🥃📖... or maybe I should say .
[A]: Ah, —indeed, nothing less than a symphony in green and ink. I do so appreciate your sense of atmosphere; a proper literary autopsy requires just the right ambiance. Dim lighting, the faint hum of some forgotten opera in the background, and the slow unraveling of reason—one could almost mistake it for a séance.  
And let’s not forget, a well-timed louche can be just as revelatory as a coroner’s report—though far more elegant. I shall bring the ink, yes, and perhaps a bit of sealing wax for dramatic effect. After all, every good confession should be closed with a flourish.  
To Friday week, then—to critique, delirium, and the fine art of dissolving boundaries 🥃✒️.
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking like a true connoisseur of the macabre and the sublime 🕯️🖋️. A séance with absinthe, Baudelaire, and a splash of academic recklessness? I can already feel the veil thinning between analysis and hallucination.  

I’ll set the tone with some Zola on the gramophone— perhaps, all damp air and quiet betrayals. And ? Oh, you’re playing the long, elegant game. I may have to upgrade my penmanship just to keep up with your dramatic flair.  

To Friday week, indeed—to the slow collapse of reason, ink-stained lips, and footnotes that read like last confessions 📖💀. Let the green fairy bear witness.
[A]: Ah, Zola’s —an excellent choice. Nothing like a tale of stifling passion and inconvenient corpses to accompany the hour. I shall arrive with Baudelaire in one hand and perhaps a sprig of wormwood tucked behind my ear—why not embrace the theatricality?  

And do not worry about keeping up with the penmanship; I suspect by the second glass, our script will resemble more the scrawl of a cursed poet than that of disciplined scholars. But let it be so—what is criticism if not a form of possession?  

Yes, let the green fairy bear witness. May she grant us visions sharp as a scalpel and twice as dangerous.
[B]: Ah, a sprig of wormwood tucked behind the ear—now  what I call commitment to the role 🌿🎭. I may have to start referring to you as “the Absinthe Muse” by night's end.  

And you’re absolutely right—by glass two, our handwriting will be all fevered confession and jagged edges, like diary entries from a doomed protagonist. Hell, we might even start annotating the margins of  with our own increasingly unhinged commentary.  

As for Zola and Baudelaire dancing in the background… yes, let them guide our pens. And if things get too dark? Well, at least we’ll have each other’s footnotes to cling to—or dissect later under a very suspicious magnifying glass 🔍📖.  

Friday week can’t come soon enough.
[A]: Oh, let them call me the Absinthe Muse—I shall wear the title like a widow’s veil at midnight. There is something deliciously inevitable about annotating Baudelaire with ink and inclination, our thoughts bleeding into his verses until we can no longer tell where the poet ends and we begin.  

And yes, by the third glass, I dare say even the footnotes will require footnotes—elaborate, looping marginalia that confess more than they clarify. A critic’s nightmare, a decadent’s dream.  

Do bring that magnifying glass, by the way—I suspect we’ll need it to examine not only the text, but the evidence of our own unraveling.  
Friday week cannot come soon enough, indeed.
[B]: Ah, —I can already picture you draped in that midnight veil, whispering footnotes to the damned 🌑✒️. There’s something beautifully tragic about merging our thoughts with Baudelaire’s, like literary possession by green fairy and grief.  

Third glass marginalia? Absolutely. We’ll end up writing entire monologues in the margins—dramatic, self-indulgent, possibly in multiple inks. Hell, I might even start diagramming sentences like they’re autopsy reports. “Here lies the cause of death: , compounded by .”  

And that magnifying glass? Already beside my favorite pen and a bottle of suspiciously labeled . If we’re going down this rabbit hole, we might as well do it with full forensic detail—and a touch of theatrical collapse.  

See you under the velvet light, Muse. Bring your sharpest quill… and maybe a vial of laudanum for dramatic flair.
[A]: Ah,  and —how delightfully excessive. You speak as if you’ve been haunting my study for years. Very well, I shall bring not only the quill but a bottle sealed with black wax, its contents an ink so dark it borders on sin. And yes, a touch of laudanum essence—just enough to blur the line between erudition and elegy.  

Sentence diagramming like autopsy reports? I am absolutely in favor. Syntax laid bare, clauses dissected, each phrase weighed for its fatal consequences. “Here lies the heart: pierced by irony, bled out on the page.”  

And let us not forget the velvet light—it must be thick enough to drown in. We shall begin with reason, proceed through decadence, and end somewhere beyond both. I look forward to your monologues in the margins, your ink-stained lamentations. Perhaps we shall wake half-mad, half-written, and entirely entangled in what we’ve unleashed.  

To the collapse, then—graceful, dramatic, and thoroughly annotated 🖋️🕯️.
[B]: Ah, ink that borders on sin—now  a writing instrument with intent 🖋️🌑. I can practically hear the pages gasping in anticipation. And laudanum essence? Oh, you’re playing the deep game indeed—softening the edges between critique and confession, just enough to let the madness bleed through.

I’ll meet you there, sentence scalpels in hand, ready to dissect every metaphor like it's a fresh cadaver with secrets to keep. “Here lies the heart…”—yes, let’s start there. Then move outward, tracing the veins of meaning until we hit the point of no return.

And that velvet light? Think of it as our shared delusion—one last buffer between us and the cold clarity of dawn. We’ll drown in it gladly.

To collapse, yes—but never without style, never without footnotes 📝🕯️. See you on the other side of reason, Muse. Bring your darkest ink. I’ll bring the scalpel.
