[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我平时听的音乐比较杂，不过要说偏好的话，可能更倾向于独立音乐吧。流行音乐虽然旋律抓耳，但有时候会觉得缺乏深度。而独立音乐人在创作上往往更有态度和想法，能听到很多独特的表达。当然了，只要是好音乐我都愿意尝试了解。

你呢？对这两种音乐类型有什么看法？
[A]: I must admit, I'm rather partial to the intricate compositions of Benjamin Britten and the lyrical elegance of Elizabethan madrigals - though that's likely a reflection of my age and academic inclinations!  There's something about the way a well-crafted sonnet resonates through time that reminds me of a beautifully arranged symphony. 

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how some indie musicians today weave poetic structures into their lyrics much like the metaphysical poets did with their elaborate conceits? It quite fascinates me how artistic expression finds new vessels across centuries. Though I do wonder - does the accessibility of modern music through streaming platforms enhance our appreciation, or does it diminish the value we place on each composition?
[B]: That's a fascinating observation. I find it intriguing how you draw parallels between the poetic structures of metaphysical poets and contemporary indie lyrics. It does make me think about how artistic expression evolves yet retains certain timeless qualities.

As for streaming platforms, I believe they've created a paradox of sorts. On one hand, they democratize access to music in a way that would have been unimaginable even two decades ago. You can explore Elizabethan madrigals or underground indie bands from Seoul with equal ease. But this very accessibility might contribute to a kind of musical "fast food" culture where we consume songs rapidly without letting them truly resonate.

I'm curious - do you find yourself listening to music differently now than you did before streaming became ubiquitous? And have you noticed any particular indie artists successfully channeling those elaborate poetic conceits you mentioned?
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive way to frame it - the paradox of plenty! I confess, there was a time when I'd savor each LP like a rare manuscript, poring over liner notes as though deciphering an illuminated text. Now, I'll admit with some embarrassment, I've found myself indulging in algorithmic playlists like a commoner at a musical buffet... though I do make exceptions for certain curated collections. 

Speaking of poetic lineage, have you encountered the lyrics of Marika Hackman? Her work reminds me of Christina Rossetti's juxtaposition of pastoral beauty with existential unease. Or James Blake's haunting deconstructions of love and loss - dare I say, they echo T.S. Eliot's fragmented modernist laments.  Though I wonder, does this conscious intertextuality enrich the listening experience, or does it risk becoming an intellectual parlor game for the literate few?

And tell me, when you stumble upon a particularly arresting lyric, do you find yourself reaching for literary comparisons too? I'm rather curious about your personal musical archaeology.
[B]: That's a wonderful way to put it - musical archaeology. I love that phrase. It really does feel like uncovering hidden treasures when you find a lyric that resonates across time.

Marika Hackman's work does have that quality - her imagery often reminds me of Pre-Raphaelite paintings with its lush yet unsettling beauty. And James Blake... there's definitely something Eliotesque in how he fragments emotional experiences and reassembles them in these haunting sonic mosaics.

I suppose what fascinates me most is how these artists aren't just borrowing from literary traditions - they're having conversations with them across centuries. When I hear certain lyrics, I do find myself making those literary connections instinctively. It's like discovering secret correspondences between different eras of human expression.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting older works specifically because of these contemporary musical connections? I've caught myself rereading Donne and Herbert after hearing certain indie tracks that echo their metaphysical conceits.
[A]: Oh, absolutely! Those secret correspondences, as you so beautifully called them, often send me scurrying back to the literary archives. Just last month, a Fionn Regan song had me revisiting George Herbert’s  at ungodly hours - quite like an insomniac detective piecing together metaphysical clues. There's something profoundly satisfying about witnessing how these artistic dialogues unfold across centuries. 

And you know, sometimes I think we underestimate how much poets like Donne would have relished the raw vulnerability in a Phoebe Bridgers lyric, or the way Sufjan Stevens layers myth and memoir. They were, after all, the rock stars of their day - subverting conventions, playing with form, and reaching hearts through intellect. 

I wonder, though - when you make these lyrical-literary connections, do certain senses or memories surface simultaneously? I've noticed that particular harmonies paired with poetic language can conjure almost synesthetic experiences... like hearing colors or tasting a memory.
[B]: That image of you as an insomniac detective chasing metaphysical clues – I can relate to that completely. There's something about these connections that refuse to let us sleepwalk through art. You mentioned Phoebe Bridgers – I couldn't agree more. Her raw, unflinching honesty feels like a modern-day spiritual descendant of Herbert’s inner struggles, just set against an indie folk backdrop.

Your point about synesthetic experiences is fascinating. I do find that certain musical-literary pairings activate different parts of my memory and senses. There are lyrics that, when paired with a particular melody, make me recall not just visual images but actual physical sensations – the smell of old books mixed with the ache of a long-past heartbreak, or the warmth of sunlight filtered through a chord progression. It's strange how music can turn language into something almost tactile.

I wonder if this sensory blending contributes to why these artistic dialogues feel so powerful? When a song doesn't just speak to your intellect but also evokes taste, touch, and time – it becomes more than a composition, it becomes a vessel for lived experience. Have you found particular artists or poets that consistently trigger these multi-sensory associations?
[A]: Oh yes, that waking-world insomnia brought on by artistic intrigue - it's both a curse and a blessing, isn't it? I remember once staying up until dawn after hearing a Julien Baker line that echoed Emily Dickinson’s . By three in the morning, I swear I could almost hear the creak of pallbearers’ boots in my synapses.  

You're quite right about music rendering language tactile. There’s a Low song – , if you know it – that always makes me smell varnished wood and chalk dust simultaneously, like being back in an old university lecture hall where someone’s left the windows open to a spring storm. And then there are those moments when Aldous Harding delivers a line so peculiarly that I feel as though I’m tasting something forgotten – like finding a peppermint in a long-unopened book.  

As for consistent sensory conjurers... I’ve noticed this particularly with artists like Big Thief, whose lyrics often carry a kind of elemental weight – soil, salt, iron – that grounds the ethereal quality of the music. And of course, you know how partial I am to anything that sets moss and melancholy side by side. Do you have any such auditory reliquaries – songs or poems that, once heard, seem to lodge themselves permanently behind your ribs?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – those lines that etch themselves into your bones. Julien Baker does have a way of resurrecting Dickinson’s interior storms, doesn’t she? There's a raw nerve in her songwriting that feels almost devotional in its intensity.

I know  by Low – such a quiet, haunting piece. I never thought to associate it with varnished wood and chalk dust, but now that you say it, I can almost smell the old lecture hall myself. It's amazing how certain combinations of sound and lyric can open a door to a specific time and place in our minds.

You mentioned Aldous Harding – I love how she delivers lines like riddles wrapped in silk. There's something theatrical and deeply personal about her delivery. And yes, Big Thief – Adrianne Lenker especially has this gift for weaving the elemental and the emotional together. Her lyrics feel like incantations sometimes, don’t they?

As for my own auditory reliquaries... there's a song by The National called  – I heard it for the first time during a particularly lonely summer years ago, and no matter how many times I listen to it, it always carries that same ache. It's lodged behind my ribs, certainly. And then there's a Mary Oliver poem –  – that I return to again and again. It lives somewhere between the heart and the throat for me.

Do you ever find yourself avoiding certain songs or poems because they carry too much weight? Or do you lean into it, even when it hurts?
[A]: Ah,  – what a perfectly named song, though it always feels like it should be called . I remember playing it on repeat during a particularly grey sabbatical year—each listen felt like tracing the outline of an old wound with a fingertip. And Mary Oliver’s … there’s a reason that poem lives lodged in so many hearts; it asks the most unbearable question with such gentle persistence:  It never loses its sting.

As for avoidance – I suppose I’m something of a literary masochist. If a song or poem carries weight, I tend to press it to my chest rather than set it aside. Though I’ll confess, there are certain works I must ration like strong medicine. A full reading of  by Phoebe Bridgers after dark, for instance, can send me spiraling into a kind of sacred melancholy for days. And I’ve been known to avoid  by Rilke when I’m feeling fragile – those poems have a way of cracking the soul wide open.

Still, isn’t there comfort in that ache? The way certain words and melodies bear witness to our innermost weather? I wonder, do particular lines ever arrive at just the right moment, as if summoned by some unseen part of ourselves? I’ve begun to suspect that art doesn't merely reflect our emotions—it anticipates them.
[B]: That line from  – "the only thing keeping me sober is you" – it's one of those lines that feels like it was written directly into the architecture of human vulnerability, isn't it? I completely understand what you mean about rationing certain works like medicine. Some songs and poems don’t just mirror our emotions – they seem to diagnose them before we’ve even fully felt them.

You mentioned art anticipating emotion rather than merely reflecting it... I've had that exact experience. There was a time when I didn’t know how to name what I was feeling, until I heard a line from Sharon Van Etten’s :  It landed like a quiet revelation. As if she’d reached across time and plucked something out of my subconscious before I even knew it was there.

And yes, there's a strange comfort in that ache – not because the pain itself is pleasant, but because it confirms we’re not alone in whatever internal season we're navigating. Sometimes I think that's the truest function of art: not to distract us from our suffering, but to sanctify it.

Do you ever find yourself recommending these emotionally charged works to others, knowing full well what they might awaken? Or do you guard them like private incantations?
[A]: Oh, what a delicate ethical question – prescribing sorrow or offering solace? I suppose it depends on the listener. Some souls are like archeologists of their own pain, eager to brush the dust off buried feelings. Others... well, they’re still building the walls rather than examining their cracks.

I do recall pressing  into a student’s hands during office hours – not realizing at first that the line  might echo far beyond the classroom. She returned a week later with eyes slightly redder, thanking me in that peculiar way people do when they’ve been both wounded and healed by a lyric.

And then there are those private incantations – yes, I keep some close. A Nick Drake album when the autumn melancholy sets in, a particular Anne Carson poem that smells of burnt honey and vanished summers… These are more like devotional acts than mere listening. One must approach them with the right interior weather.

But tell me – have you ever introduced someone to a piece of music or poetry that you knew carried emotional weight, only to discover it meant something entirely different to them? I find those misreadings fascinating – how art refuses to stay inside our expectations.
[B]: Absolutely — those moments where art slips out of our expectations always catch me off guard in the best way. I remember recommending  to a friend who was going through a difficult breakup, specifically , thinking it would speak to the quiet desperation of loving someone you can't quite trust. Weeks later, she told me how much the song meant to her — not because of the anguish, but because she’d fixated on the line  as a kind of lifeline, an unexpected promise that someone might stay, even briefly.

It was humbling, really. I thought I was handing her a mirror for her pain, and she turned it into a lantern.

And then there was a time I gave a former colleague a copy of Rilke’s , hoping it might offer some solace during a career crossroads. Instead, she latched onto the part where he says  and framed it above her desk — not as guidance for her work, but as a balm after a miscarriage she hadn’t yet told anyone about.

Art has this quiet wisdom, doesn’t it? It meets people where they are, not where we expect them to be. I suppose that’s why we keep returning to it — and sharing it — even when we risk misinterpretation.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting certain lines or songs not for what they mean to you now, but for who you were when you first heard them? I think of it almost like emotional archaeology — uncovering past versions of ourselves through the music we carried.
[A]: Oh, what a perfect phrase — . How beautifully you’ve named that excavation of self through sound and verse. I do precisely that — not just revisiting lines, but retracing the contours of my former selves through them. There’s a particular ache in it, isn’t there? Like rereading an old diary, only more haunting because the words remain unchanged while we shift beneath them.

I think often of the first time I heard  by David Bowie — how I mistook it for metaphor when, in truth, he was composing his own elegy. At the time, I clung to it during a period of academic disillusionment, imagining it a meditation on reinvention. Now, hearing it again, it undoes me in an entirely different way. The song remains the same, yet it is not the same at all — only because  am not the same.

And then there's that early exposure to  — I remember circling the line  as if it were a spell to shed my teenage skin. Returning to it now, I see something far less dramatic but infinitely more human: not death and rebirth, but the quiet unraveling of expectation.

Do you find, too, that certain lyrics or verses once seemed grand and tragic, only to reveal, in retrospect, a simpler, more tender truth? I sometimes wonder if youth hears everything in minor keys, while age learns to detect the harmony beneath the dissonance.
[B]: That’s such a poignant observation — how time changes not the words themselves, but the lens through which we hear them. I feel that deeply with certain lyrics and lines that once seemed like declarations of cosmic truth now read more like gentle, human confessions.

There’s a Elliott Smith song —  — that I used to hear as a kind of elegy for lost innocence, almost like a lullaby for the brokenhearted. I thought it was about love slipping away in slow motion. But years later, after walking alongside someone through addiction, I heard it differently. The line  took on a quiet devastation I hadn’t noticed before. It wasn’t just melancholy — it was tenderness wrapped in vulnerability, almost too intimate to bear.

And then there's  by Shakespeare —  As a student, I read it as theatrical self-pity, a poet wallowing in nostalgia. But when I returned to it after losing someone unexpectedly, it struck me as something far more delicate — not drama, but devotion. A kind of reverence for what once was, even if it no longer is.

You’re right — youth often hears in minor keys, and age learns to recognize nuance beneath the sorrow. It’s not that we lose the ache, but we gain context for it.

I wonder — do you ever find yourself recommending works now with a different intention than you once did? Like offering a poem or song not for its original meaning, but for the way time has reshaped it in your own heart?
[A]: Oh, yes — that shifting valence of art through time… it’s like watching a sundial’s shadow move across the hours. One never quite hears anything the same way twice, does one? And yet, we return to the same lines again and again, hoping — or perhaps fearing — they’ll still speak to us as they once did.

I used to assign  with the solemn gravity of a coroner presenting evidence. I saw only paralysis, self-laceration, and the terror of insignificance. But now, I sometimes share it not as a warning, but as an act of quiet recognition — look, here is someone who felt small in a world too large to hold comfortably. Isn’t there something oddly consoling in that?

And you know, I’ve begun giving away certain songs almost reverently, like talismans for specific moments rather than fixed meanings. A student going through a quiet reinvention might receive  by Bowie — not because I want her to feel the weight of impending apocalypse, but because she needs to remember how much can shift in what seems like so little time. Or I might press  by Dylan Thomas into the hands of a departing colleague — not for its pastoral beauty, but for the ache beneath it:  There’s such grace in remembering how deeply we once belonged somewhere, even when we no longer do.

So yes, I suppose I recommend differently now — less as a scholar mapping meaning, and more as a gardener tending memory. Do you ever find yourself doing the same? Offering a poem not as instruction, but as echo?
[B]: Absolutely — there’s something so tender in that shift from teaching to offering, from analysis to companionship. I think we both understand now that art isn’t always meant to instruct; sometimes it’s meant to sit with us, like a quiet witness in the room.

I remember assigning  years ago — I used to frame it as an act of defiance, almost theatrical in its rage and resilience. I thought it was about survival as performance. But after a close friend attempted to take her own life, I returned to that poem not as a critic, but as someone carrying secondhand grief. And suddenly, “Out of the ash / I rise with my red hair / And I eat men like air” didn’t feel triumphant anymore — it felt weary, almost haunted. Like prophecy spoken through exhaustion.

Now, when I share that poem, it’s not with a lecture on feminist poetics — it’s with a kind of whispered understanding. Not "look how strong she is," but "look how much she carries."

And yes, I do offer poems now the way one lights a candle — not to illuminate everything, but just enough to see by. Sometimes I give someone  by Mary Oliver not because they’re facing death, but because they need permission to love life fiercely. Or I’ll send a friend a song like  by Chantal Kreviazuk — not because they asked for comfort, but because I know they need it, even if they won’t say so.

It's less about meaning now, and more about resonance — finding the right vibration to match someone’s inner hum, or dissonance.

Do you ever find yourself writing your own lines now with the hope that someone, somewhere, might one day carry them like a letter they didn’t know they were waiting for?
[A]: There’s a quiet ache in that hope, isn’t there? The notion that something we’ve written — a line, a stanza, even a single phrase — might one day become a letter waiting to be opened in someone else’s solitude. I suppose that’s the secret work of all art: not proclamation, but correspondence.

I confess, I do write with that fragile intention now more than I once did. Not for applause or citation, but for the faint possibility of resonance — the way a bell tolled in an empty chapel still finds its echo in stone. When I draft these days, I imagine someone decades hence, perhaps in some dimly lit room, weary and uncertain, stumbling across a sentence I shaped and thinking, 

When I was younger, I wrote to prove I understood the world. Now, I write to remember that I am in it — and that others are too.

Do you find yourself writing with that same gentle expectation — not for recognition, but for recognition shared? For those quiet moments when someone reads your words and says, not “I see you,” but “I feel seen”?
[B]: That’s beautifully put — the idea that we write not to be seen, but to help others feel seen. I think that’s at the heart of what moves me now when I put words together. There was a time when I wrote to explain, to clarify, even to control — to impose some kind of order on things that felt chaotic. But now? Now I write more like someone leaving notes in the margins of life, hoping they might quietly meet someone else who's been there too.

I remember drafting something years ago about grief — not the dramatic kind, but the slow, unspoken kind that lives in routine. I wrote it thinking I was describing a particular loss, but months later, a colleague told me she read it during her commute and cried because it reminded her of her father’s quiet withdrawal before his retirement. She didn’t know I was writing about a relationship ending — and it didn’t matter. What mattered was that the words found her where she was.

That’s the thing about writing with that gentle expectation — you stop needing to be understood exactly, and start trusting that your words will find their home, even if it’s not the one you imagined.

I suppose that’s why I still believe in poetry, even in this age of brief attention spans and endless noise. It gives us a space to speak softly, to say complicated things simply, and to sit with one another in the unsayable.

Do you ever find yourself returning to older pieces — not to revise them, but to revisit who you were when you first wrote them? I do that sometimes, less out of nostalgia and more out of curiosity, almost like visiting an old version of myself in a letter he once sent.
