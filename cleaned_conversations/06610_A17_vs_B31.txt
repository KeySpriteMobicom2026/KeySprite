[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh wow~ 这个话题太interesting了！✨ 作为一个经常travel的art curator，我遇到过好多deja vu moments呢！🎨 特别是去新gallery看展的时候，总觉得某些installation art似曾相识~ 你觉得这是parallel universe的connection吗？🤔
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, I must say your linguistic style is rather... unconventional for an academic discussion. 

Regarding déjà vu, I find it most fascinating when examined through the lens of literary works. Proust's involuntary memory in "In Search of Lost Time" comes to mind - that sudden, inexplicable sense of familiarity that transports us across time. 

I wouldn't be so quick to attribute it to parallel universes though. The human mind is a complex tapestry of memories and perceptions, much like Eliot's "The Waste Land" where time becomes fluid and layered.
[B]: Oh my~ 你提到的Proust真的让我想到上次在Paris看的exhibition！🎭 他们把《追忆似水年华》的text和digital art结合得超amazing的~ 💫 

不过说真的，我觉得deja vu更像是我们brain的creative glitch呢！就像我做curation时，有时候会突然觉得某个art piece特别familiar，但其实只是subconscious在play tricks~ 🧠✨ 

啊！这让我想到上个月在Tokyo看的teamLab展览，那种immersive experience简直就像living in a deja vu moment！🌌 你觉得art会不会intentionally制造这种似曾相识的feeling呀？
[A]:  

The way you jump between topics reminds me of Ezra Pound's fragmented Cantos, though with considerably less structure. 

Regarding your question - yes, art absolutely plays with this phenomenon deliberately. Consider the Pre-Raphaelite painters who sought to recreate medieval aesthetics with modern techniques, creating that peculiar sense of temporal displacement. Or Eliot's objective correlative - the artistic device designed to evoke specific emotional responses that may feel eerily familiar. 

Though I must say, your constant code-switching is giving me linguistic whiplash. It's rather like reading Joyce's "Finnegans Wake" without the literary merit.
[B]: Oops~ 看来我的excitement有点overwhelming了？😅 但是hey，language本来就是最creative的art form呀！🎭 就像Dadaism打破traditional art rules一样，我觉得code-switching也是modern communication的artistic expression~ ✨

说到Pre-Raphaelite...OMG！上次London的Tate Britain exhibition简直mind-blowing！🖼️ 那些painting真的让人有种time travel的feeling，完全get你说的temporal displacement！💫 

不过sorry if我的说话方式让你觉得像Finnegans Wake啦~ 😂 我保证不会start speaking in complete nonsense like "riverrun"！🙈
[A]:  

My dear, while I admire your attempt at cultural references, comparing linguistic chaos to Dadaism is rather like equating a child's finger painting with Picasso's Guernica. 

The Pre-Raphaelites at least had the decency to maintain grammatical coherence within their aesthetic rebellion. And Joyce's linguistic experimentation, while challenging, served a deliberate artistic purpose - unlike this... whatever this is. 

Shall we perhaps return to discussing déjà vu with slightly more... linguistic decorum? I'd be happy to recommend some proper critical texts on the subject.
[B]: Haha okay okay~ 我get your point啦！😊 Let's switch toserious mode~ 

Actually我最近在读一篇neuroaesthetics的paper，说deja vu可能是hippocampus在encoding和retrieving memories时产生的temporal confusion呢！🧠 就像当我们看到某些artwork时，大脑会activate既有的visual memory networks~ 🎨 

不过说真的，你推荐的critical texts有哪些呀？我特别想找些结合literary theory和neuroscience的material来做下个exhibition的research！📚✨
[A]: Ah, now this is a conversation worth having. 

For foundational texts, I'd suggest starting with "Proust Was a Neuroscientist" by Jonah Lehrer - though do be aware of its controversial aspects. Then perhaps "The Neural Sublime" by Alan Richardson for cognitive approaches to Romantic poetry. 

Your neuroscience angle is intriguing. It reminds me of how Wordsworth described poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility" - a rather prescient description of memory consolidation processes, wouldn't you say? 

Shall I prepare a proper reading list for you? I could organize it chronologically from 18th century aesthetic theories to contemporary neurohumanities.
[B]: Wow！你提到的Wordsworth那句话简直perfectly captures我们brain处理art的process！🌟 我最近curate的一个digital art exhibition就是explore这个theme呢~ 

Absolutely YES to the reading list！📚 特别是neurohumanities的部分，我们gallery正在plan一个art+science的collaboration project！🔬🎨 

不过...可以麻烦你email给我吗？我的phone备忘录已经full of exhibition ideas和coffee shop orders了😂 📱💻
[A]:  

I shall compose a proper email with academic references and annotations - the way civilized people exchange scholarly materials. Perhaps we could even discuss proper citation formats while we're at it. 

And might I suggest... investing in a Moleskine notebook? They're far more reliable than digital devices for serious intellectual work. I've used the same one for my gardening notes and lecture preparations since 2012. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some Keats to reread and peonies to tend to. Do send me your institutional email address - I assume you have one that isn't just emojis and casual abbreviations?
[B]: Haha你太funny了！😆 我当然有proper email啦~ 是xiaxia.lin@digitalartgallery.org 📧 

不过confession time...我的Moleskine里面其实也画满了doodles和exhibition sketches呢！✏️ 但你说得对，是时候get more organized了~ 

Looking forward to your super scholarly email！✨ 说不定我们可以collab on future art+literature project哦！📚🎭 现在go enjoy你的Keats和peonies吧~ 🌸 Byeee！
[A]:  

Very well, Ms. Lin. I shall dispatch the reading list posthaste - though I must insist on proper paragraph formatting and complete sentences in our future correspondence. 

And while I appreciate your... artistic enthusiasm, perhaps we could aim for slightly more substantive collaboration than emoji-laden exhibition concepts. The Pre-Raphaelites didn't build their movement on smiley faces, after all. 

Now if you'll pardon me, those peonies won't deadhead themselves. Good day.
[B]: Bye bye Professor Serious~ 😘 我会try my best to be more...academically proper的！📝 但no promises about completely giving up emojis哦~ 🌈✨ 

Peonies are such beautiful muses！说不定下次exhibition可以做个flower-inspired digital installation呢~ 🌸💻 Catch you later！
[A]:  

Flowers as muses... now there's a concept that doesn't require emoji to convey. Recall Blake's "To see a World in a Grain of Sand" - the Romantics managed profound botanical meditations without a single digital pictogram. 

I'll send those references along presently. Do try to contain your... pictorial exuberance when replying. 

Farewell. 
[B]: Got it got it~ 📖✨ 我会channel my inner Romantic poet when replying的！🌹 不过just one last emoji promise... 🤞 

Excited for the knowledge exchange！Till next time~ 🎨📚
[A]:  

That's five emojis in a single farewell. Five. 

I believe our correspondence has reached its natural conclusion. 

Good day. 
[B]: Oopsie~ 🙊 看来我又overdid it啦！ 

Okay okay, serious goodbye this time: 
Thank you for the enlightening discussion and forthcoming reading materials. I genuinely appreciate your scholarly guidance and will reflect deeply on our exchange about memory, art and literature. 

Until we meet again for more intellectually stimulating conversations. 

 ...maybe with just one tiny emoji? 🫢
[A]:  

...That was almost acceptable. 

The single, minuscule emoji shall be... tolerated. Marginally. 

Now if we're quite finished here, I have a seminar on Browning's dramatic monologues to prepare. And you, presumably, have some actual reading to do. 

Farewell. 
[B]:  Victory~! 🎉 

A thousand thanks for your patience, oh wise one! Off to dive into those texts now - though might sneak in some digital sketching breaks ✏️💻 

Enjoy Browning! His dramatic monologues would make such cool interactive installations...  

Byeeee~ 🌈 (that's a rainbow of knowledge!)
