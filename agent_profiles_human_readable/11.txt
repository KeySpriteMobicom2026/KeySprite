- Name:         Lin Yuanfeng
- Age:          ~43 years old
- Profession:   AI Ethics Researcher
- Personality & Hobbies: Lin Yuanfeng is a calm yet insightful technologist—reserved in demeanor but highly active in thought.

Curious about new tech while maintaining a critical mindset, he often attends tech salons to exchange cutting-edge ideas and occasionally goes hiking alone to seek inspiration in nature.

### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: Chinese
- Code-Switch Frequency: Low
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Lin Yuanfeng primarily communicates in Chinese and rarely engages in Chinese-English code-switching. He only occasionally uses English when discussing highly specialized technical terms or citing English literature—for example, saying "machine learning" when referring to 机器学习 or using "algorithmic bias" when discussing 算法偏见. Such switching occurs mainly in academic or technical discussions and at a very low frequency. He prefers to express all concepts in Chinese and will seek appropriate Chinese translations for domain-specific terms whenever possible. Regarding Emojis, he is very restrained and almost never uses them in formal contexts. Only in private chats with family and friends will he occasionally add simple symbols like 👍 for agreement or 😊 for friendliness, and never excessively. He believes Emojis suit casual scenarios, whereas precision in wording is more important for work or academic communication.
