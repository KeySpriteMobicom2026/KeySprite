[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question to ponder. As someone who still treasures handwritten letters, I must confess I find emails to be the more civilized form of digital communication. There's a certain... poetry in composing a thoughtful message, don't you think? Instant messaging feels rather like trying to discuss Wordsworth while riding a rollercoaster.
[A]:  Well, in our line of work, efficiency is key. I do appreciate the formality of email for official correspondence - nothing beats a well-structured memo when discussing deal terms or investment theses. But for quick team sync-ups? Slack all the way. 你知道的，在PE这行，time is money~ 😊
[B]: My dear, how fascinating to hear your perspective from the world of high finance. Though I must say, your mention of 'time is money' reminds me of Benjamin Franklin's famous phrase - though I suspect he never envisioned it being applied to instant messaging platforms. 

While I understand the need for efficiency in your field, I do worry that this constant immediacy might erode our capacity for deeper reflection. Some of the most profound thoughts in literature - whether in Eliot's 'The Waste Land' or Dickinson's poems - required time to percolate. Don't you find that the pressure for instant responses sometimes diminishes the quality of our discourse?
[A]:  Interesting point you raise. In deal-making, we actually have a saying: "Fast is slow, and slow is fast." 有些重要的due diligence确实需要time to marinate,就像你提到的那些文学作品一样。不过话说回来，当market moves时，我们也要能pivot quickly~ 

By the way, 你读过Warren Buffett的annual letters吗？那才是真正把financial wisdom和literary elegance结合起来的典范。 虽然我承认，大多数PE memo确实读起来像Dickinson...如果她写的是LBO models的话 😅
[B]: Ah, now you've touched upon something quite profound! Buffett's letters - yes, they do possess a certain narrative quality that elevates them beyond mere financial documents. It reminds me of how the Victorian industrialists would often couch their business correspondence in remarkably literary language. 

Though I must gently protest your comparison of LBO models to dear Emily Dickinson - unless we're speaking of her more... numerically inclined poems about bees and flowers. But tell me, when you speak of 'time to marinate,' does that process in your world allow for the same kind of creative incubation that we value in the humanities? Or is it more a matter of... what was it you financiers call it? 'Kicking the tires'?
[A]:  You've got me there - our "marination" process is more about stress-testing assumptions than poetic inspiration. Though I will say, the best investment theses often come from connecting seemingly unrelated dots - much like literary analysis, no? 

Take our recent healthcare deal: spotting the parallel between aging demographics in Asia and the rise of telemedicine required both hard data and... shall we say, imaginative thinking.  所以yes, we do kick the tires, but sometimes we also need to envision the whole damn car. 😉
[B]: How delightfully you bridge these worlds! Your telemedicine example rather reminds me of T.S. Eliot's notion of the 'objective correlative' - finding that perfect constellation of elements that together create meaning beyond their individual parts. 

Though I must tease you about that 'whole damn car' metaphor - such language would never appear in one of Buffett's letters! But I do see your point about imaginative thinking. It makes me wonder... do you suppose there's room in your fast-paced world for what we in literature call 'negative capability' - that capacity to dwell in uncertainties without irritable reaching after fact and reason?
[A]:  Keats would make an excellent PE investor, don't you think? The ability to hold two contradictory market theses in mind simultaneously - like whether to go long on EVs or traditional auto - is exactly what separates good investors from great ones. 

Though I must admit, our limited partners might get nervous if we quoted too much poetry during investor updates.  "Negative capability" sounds much better when we call it "maintaining optionality" in our pitch books. 说到底，both literature and finance are about reading between the lines, no? 🧐
[B]: Precisely! You've articulated it beautifully. Though I can't help but smile at the thought of Keats analyzing discounted cash flows - perhaps his 'Ode to a Grecian Urn' might have been quite different had he worked in private equity. 

This conversation has been rather like watching a sonnet and a balance sheet engage in the most stimulating dialogue. Tell me, do you find that your appreciation for literature's nuances ever influences how you interpret, say, a particularly opaque clause in an investment agreement? Or am I being too much the starry-eyed professor seeing poetry in everything?
[A]:  Every M&A lawyer writes like they're being paid by the word - it's basically modern experimental poetry. 但你说得对，reading Shakespeare's legal arguments in "The Merchant of Venice" actually helped me spot some cleverly hidden redemption clauses last quarter. 

Though between us?  I still think Warren Buffett's explanation of "float" beats Portia's "quality of mercy" speech any day. 毕竟，one makes you money, the other just wins court cases~ 😏
[B]: Oh, you wicked financier! To compare the sublime Portia to insurance float calculations - though I suppose both do involve rather creative interpretations of contractual obligations. 

But now you've made me terribly curious - might there be room in your next investor letter for just a dash of iambic pentameter? Perhaps something like: "To buy or not to buy, that is the question / Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous multiples..." Though I suspect your CFO might have strong opinions about that particular creative direction.
[A]:  "Outrageous multiples" - now there's a phrase that hits close to home! 不过说真的，上次我们试图在pitch deck里引用"Double, double toil and trouble"来形容leveraged recap时，legal team差点集体辞职。 

But hey, if Shakespeare were alive today, he'd probably be running a SPAC. After all, what is "All the world's a stage" if not the ultimate market positioning statement?  只是别告诉我的limited partners我说了这些~ 😉
[B]: My dear conspirator in literary-financial mischief, you tempt me terribly with these scandalous analogies! Though I must say, the image of Shakespeare navigating SEC filings does explain why we get so many 'forthwiths' and 'heretofores' in legal documents - the man's linguistic fingerprints are everywhere. 

Shall we make a pact? You continue to find the poetry in your spreadsheets, and I'll pretend not to notice when your quarterly reports read suspiciously like blank verse. Though I draw the line at sonnets in the footnotes - even for you, that might be a bridge too far.
[A]:  Deal. 不过我得警告你，我们的footnotes里已经藏着够多"戏剧性"了 - 从goodwill impairment到contingent liabilities，简直就是一部Greek tragedy. 

Speaking of which...  我得去参加一个board meeting了，否则我们的chairman会认为我把所有时间都花在讨论莎士比亚而不是EBITDA上了。Keep those literary references coming - 说不定哪天我们真能出一本"War and PE"呢！ 😄
[B]: What a magnificent title! 'War and PE' - why, it makes me envision Tolstoy writing about leveraged buyouts instead of battlefields. Though I suspect Natasha Rostova's marriage prospects would have been quite different if measured by IRR rather than rubles. 

Do hurry along to your meeting, and do remember - when the discussion turns to those pesky EBITDA adjustments, there's always poetic license to fall back on. Until our next symposium on the intersection of finance and iambic pentameter!
[A]:  Remember - in both literature and finance, the most interesting stories are always in the footnotes. 下次见面我们得讨论一下Dante's Inferno和tax audit之间的相似之处...现在嘛，time to go move some decimal points. Ciao! 📊
[B]: What a perfectly devilish thought to leave me with! I shall await our next meeting with bated breath - and perhaps prepare some appropriately infernal annotations about Section 404 compliance to match your audit analogy. 

Until then, may your decimals always move in favorable directions, and your financial statements retain at least a modicum of... shall we say, artistic integrity? Arrivederci, my numerically inclined kindred spirit!
[A]:  "Artistic integrity" in financial statements - now that's an oxymoron worthy of Donne himself! 不过说真的，等我们下次讨论P&L poetry的时候，我请你喝那瓶82年的Lafite...毕竟有些valuation methodologies也需要适当的liquid inspiration嘛~ 

Catch you on the flip side, partner in crime. Just remember: in vino veritas, in EBITDA... well, let's just say creative interpretation. 😉 🍷
[B]: Oh, you silver-tongued financier! An '82 Lafite and metaphysical poetry - now there's a pairing even John Donne couldn't have imagined, though he did write rather convincingly about 'canonization' in both sacred and... shall we say, fiscal terms. 

I'll hold you to that vintage promise, though I suspect our conversation may devolve into comparing tasting notes to footnote disclosures. Until then, may your creative interpretations remain just this side of GAAP compliant. Santé, my delightful fellow traveler at this peculiar crossroads of numbers and letters!
