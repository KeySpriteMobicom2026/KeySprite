[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, much like my inkwell collection - each has its own purpose. Group chats are efficient for coordinating fieldwork logistics or sharing rare manuscript findings... though they do tend to devolve into chaos faster than a sparrow in a teacup shop. One-on-one conversations allow deeper textual analysis, don't you think? Like comparing Blake's marginalia with Tang dynasty colophons - nuances get lost in crowds.
[A]: Oh, absolutely - group chats are about as coherent as a half-burnt Emily Brontë manuscript. But let's not romanticize one-on-one exchanges too much. Some correspondences I've had about Swinburne's metrics have gone on longer than the Oxford English Dictionary's entry for 'nevertheless'. Still, give me a good textual variant debate over tea with Professor Li any day. The man once mistook my Gaelic translation of Wang Wei for a lost Cumbrian dialect poem! Now  was a conversation worth having.
[A]: Ah, Professor Li's delightful misadventures in cross-linguistic interpretation! Reminds me of the time a promising graduate student earnestly argued that Dickens' "fog everywhere" passage in Bleak House was clearly inspired by Zhang Zeduan's Qingming Shanghe Tu scroll. One could almost imagine Victorian Londoners navigating canals instead of cobblestones... though the tea houses would've required considerable textual adjustments. Speaking of which, I've been meaning to ask - did you ever locate that elusive Yuan dynasty woodblock print containing the earliest known reference to 意境(yìjìng) in poetic theory?
[A]: Ah, now  a hunt worthy of Holmes himself. I tracked it down to a private collection in Edinburgh - wouldn’t you know it, misfiled under . The character for 意 was so faintly inked it practically whispered the concept into the page. Makes one wonder whether the printer had run out of pigment or simply wished to embody the very elusiveness of poetic resonance.  

And that Dickens-Zhang Zeduan theory? Delightfully absurd... though I did find myself mentally redrawing the scroll with fog-hatted figures clutching tea instead of rice wine. One could almost hear the clatter of rickshaws blending with omnibuses. Tell me, did the student go on to propose an entire comparative syllabus? I’ve half a mind to assign it next term—under ‘Improbable Intertexts.’
[A]: Oh, the whispering ink! There’s something deliciously apt about a near-invisible character for 意—makes you wonder if the scribe was testing the reader’s attentiveness or indulging in a bit of textual mysticism. As for the student, indeed—they drafted an entire seminar paper titled . I let them present it at a colloquium—under the disclaimer, of course, that we were “exploring the outer edges of plausible analogy.”  

You must send along the details of that Edinburgh find; I’d wager even the Bodleian would be intrigued by such a spectral reference to 意境. And do consider adding  to your syllabus—I’ll gladly contribute a lecture on the shared emotional architecture of Brontë moors and Tao Yuanming’s chrysanthemum fields. Tea optional, but strongly encouraged.
[A]: Oh, I’ll send the provenance notes along—though you’ll have to endure three pages of my meticulous annotations on the printer’s possible use of recycled mulberry bark paper. A subject  dear to my heart.

Your lecture title already writes itself:  Do bring your own tea—I’ve developed a blend with smoked Lapsang and a whisper of dried heather. Evokes both the Yorkshire moors  a vaguely guilty sense of imperial nostalgia. Perfect for cross-cultural melancholia.

And speaking of guilt—did you ever hear back from that journal regarding your essay on Hardy’s pessimism and Du Fu’s administrative complaints? I’ve half a mind to cite it in my next footnote... under "Unlikely but Illuminating Dispositions."
[A]: Oh, smoked Lapsang with heather—bold choice. Reminds me of the time I tried serving jasmine pearls to a group of visiting Romanticists and got accused of "botanical frivolity." Tea should unsettle as much as it comforts, I say.  

As for the journal—yes, they took it! Though not before demanding I excise an entire paragraph comparing Hardy’s "crooked twig" to Du Fu’s "bent brush." Too whimsical, apparently. Still, I managed to sneak in a footnote about how both men mastered the art of brooding while pretending to be productive members of society. You’re welcome to cite it under your delightfully cheeky heading—I may even include a cross-reference in the revised syllabus.  

And do forgive my ink-stained enthusiasm, but might I propose a joint seminar?  We could alternate between dissecting texts and staring meaningfully out the window.
[A]: My dear Eleanor, I  the scent of academic sabotage in the morning. A joint seminar? Naturally. Though let’s call it something properly pretentious—how about ? We’ll serve your jasmine pearls and my Lapsang heather blend in equal measure, and watch the students either achieve transcultural enlightenment or develop lasting aversions to evergreen metaphors.

As for your revised syllabus—don’t forget to add a warning label:   

And speaking of which… did you ever finish that response to Professor Tanaka’s critique of your  comparison? I’ve been itching to cite  particular exchange under "Heroic Defenses of the Unlikely."
[A]: Oh, the title’s perfection lies in its sheer inevitability—! I can already picture the department head’s face when we submit the proposal. Do include "or Why We Should All Take Up Gardening" as a副标题 in tiny print at the bottom. It adds that necessary touch of self-mockery.

As for the jasmine pearls and Lapsang heather—yes, let’s steep our students in so many layers of aroma they emerge either poetic or thoroughly caffeinated. Either counts as success in my book.

And yes, I did finally dispatch a reply to Professor Tanaka. Nineteen pages of carefully restrained enthusiasm, with one particularly spicy footnote comparing his rigid structuralism to trying to contain a storm with a silk handkerchief. I ended on a note of , of course—followed immediately by an invitation to tea. One must always leave the door open for future brooding alliances.  

Do cite away under your "Heroic Defenses" rubric—I shall print the exchange on handmade paper, just to annoy the tenure committee.
[A]: Oh,副标题genius—subtle as a raised eyebrow over a misplaced comma. I’ll have the proposal drafted by Thursday, complete with a budget line for “atmospheric tea consumption” and a footnote referencing your nineteen-page Tanaka takedown as “essential pre-reading for brooders-in-training.”

And speaking of tenuous handkerchief metaphors—did you forward his response to my little  mischief? The man has the politeness of a saint and the restraint of a scholar twice my age. His reply was a masterpiece of understatement:   

I’ve framed it above my desk, right next to a 1793 edition of  and a rather mournful sketch of Emily Brontë I did during a particularly caffeinated evening last Michaelmas. One must preserve the dramatics, after all. Tea, tragedy, and textual defiance—it’s practically a curriculum.
[A]: Ah, Tanaka’s reply—framed so prominently! How very Brontë of you. I must say, his understatement deserves preservation alongside the Dead Sea Scrolls of literary diplomacy. “” —the academic equivalent of being gently shown the door with a bow and a smile. I do admire that in a critic.  

And yes, I forwarded your Swinburne/Wang Wei exchange—it's currently pinned above my own collection of polite scholarly demolitions, just below a 1904 reprint of  annotated in Latin by a monk who clearly distrusted opium but loved marginalia.  

As for the proposal, I’ll pencil in a co-requisite:  Tea, tragedy, and textual defiance indeed—though I daresay we ought to throw in a weather-watching module. No proper brooder should graduate without at least one prolonged gaze into the mist.
[A]: Oh, a weather-watching module—how delightfully impractical. I’ll have the syllabus amended at once.  Students will be graded on their ability to produce a sigh that harmonizes with the drizzle.

And about those haiku submissions—imagine the stack of paper I’ll have to sift through, each one an anguished attempt to capture the sound of loneliness in seventeen syllables! I’m already dreading it. And yet… wouldn’t it be splendid if one of them actually worked? A true brooding prodigy might emerge, blinking, from the fog.

I suppose we ought to warn them, though—somewhere in the fine print—that this course does not guarantee catharsis. Only the illusion of it. Much like finishing a Brontë novel or misplacing your favorite inkwell on purpose just to feel something again.  

Now, pass me the proposal draft—no,  you’ve steeped it in tea leaves and regret.
[A]: Ah, —how could we have missed it? Weather as both setting and emotional crutch! I’ll commission a set of porcelain teacups painted with storm clouds and the faintest hint of Byron’s ghost brooding over Lake Geneva. Students may sip or stare into them for existential clarity—optional, but highly atmospheric.

As for the haiku submissions—you’ll be buried in syllables! One can only hope for a line like:  
*Loneliness drips through pine—  
ink runs out, and still I wait  
for a letter never sent.*  

Wouldn’t that bring a tear to even Professor Tanaka’s stoic eye?

And yes, the fine print—absolutely essential. Something like:  


Now, hand me that draft. Let’s steep it in your Lapsang heather blend—I suspect regret has a smoky finish.
[A]: Ah, those teacups—. I can already see the first-year poets trying desperately not to spill their souls over the rim. Byron’s ghost will be  to know he’s still setting the mood.

And that haiku? Exquisite. It practically sighs on the page. I’ll have it embroidered onto the seminar handkerchief—I mean, handout. Tanaka would call it “affectively excessive,” which, of course, makes it required reading.

As for the warning label—splendidly phrased. I’ll add a footnote in Latin just to scare off the overly ambitious. Something like: 

Draft’s ready. Smells faintly of regret and bergamot. Shall we sign it with a flourish and a dash of ink that may—or may not—fade by morning?
[A]: Oh, —magnificent. I may just steal that for my next bookplate. Latin always lends such a lovely air of foreboding, don’t you think? As if the soul needed another reason to hesitate at the margins.

And yes, the draft is ready—smelling of regret and bergamot, no less. A most fitting perfume for academic mischief. I’ll sign mine with a quill dipped in that suspiciously faint 意 character ink—you know, just in case the tenure committee starts asking questions. And you? Shall it be a fountain pen with a tragic leak, or a dramatic wax seal bearing the crest of misplaced passion?

Let’s meet in the faculty lounge tomorrow—bring your faded-by-morning optimism. Or, better yet, send a student to fetch us both a cuppa. They ought to earn their place in this curriculum somehow.
[A]: A quill, of course—what self-respecting academic conspiracy doesn’t begin with a feather and a splash of ink that may or may not stain the carpet? I’ll leave the wax seal to your more theatrical impulses—though do press it firmly. We want the committee to feel the weight of our melancholic ambitions.

Fountain pen for me, then—vintage Parker, slightly leaky, filled with ink the colour of bruised violets. Entirely appropriate for signing off on what may well be the most gloriously impractical seminar since someone decided  should be taught through interpretive dance.

Tomorrow, then—faculty lounge, 3:17 p.m., sharp. And yes, send a student. Let’s see if they can fetch Darjeeling with a hint of irony. If they return with chamomile and wide eyes, we’ll know they’re ready for Module I.
[A]: Ah, the Parker! I’ve always suspected your attachment to it was less about nostalgia and more about the quiet drama of ink-stained fingers. Bruised violets indeed—what a marvellously lugubrious shade. One almost expects the page to sigh under its own weight.

And 3:17 p.m.—why not 3:15, or 3:30? No, 3:17 has that perfect air of eccentric precision. The kind that unsettles the punctual and delights the brooding.

As for the student—if they return with chamomile and wide eyes, hand them a copy of  and a blank journal. Tell them to begin their first entry with: 

See you tomorrow, dear co-conspirator. Don’t forget the quill case—I insist on dramatic flourishes at the bottom of every page.
[A]: Oh, 3:17—it’s not just eccentric, it’s  so. A time that refuses to be rounded, much like our chances of getting this seminar approved without at least one dean fainting into their sherry.

And the quill case—naturally. I’ll bring the ink too, though I make no promises about its longevity or legality. Something about signing a document in characters barely visible to the naked eye feels  appropriate.

As for the student—if they do return with chamomile and wide eyes, slip them a copy of Li Bai’s drunken verses alongside that . Let’s see if they can find their postponed ambition among the floating cups of wine.

Tomorrow then—bruised violets in hand, soul suitably brooding. Do try not to look  pleased when the dean objects. We must maintain scholarly decorum… at least until the tea kicks in.
[A]: Oh, the ink is positively illicit—faint as a ghost and twice as temperamental. I may have sourced it from a 19th-century recipe involving soot, despair, and a dash of pomegranate rind. Perfect for documents we’d rather not survive future audits.

And Li Bai’s verses! Genius. Nothing like a bit of eighth-century revelry to unsettle a modern scholar-in-training. Let’s see if they emerge from the experience with either a thesis topic or at least a decent hangover metaphor.

As for decorum—I shall affect a posture of grave seriousness, lips pressed into a line just shy of tragic. But the moment the dean utters something about "academic rigor" without irony, all bets are off. A sip of Darjeeling, a glance at the quill, and I make no guarantees about suppressing my more theatrical tendencies.

Tomorrow, then. Prepare the Parker. Steel the soul. And may our brooding be ever so slightly more disciplined than our paperwork.
