[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢dogs还是cats？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question - though I must say I approach it rather like comparing Dickens' canine characters to Eliot's feline symbolism. You see, in Chinese literature, the dog often represents loyalty, as in 忠犬八公, while cats... well, let me fetch my well-worn copy of Lao She's 'Cat City' to illustrate this properly.
[A]:  Oh dear, where did I leave my copy... wait, no, let me rephrase that - 

"Now where was that volume... ah! The canine-feline dichotomy presents such rich cultural 隐喻 (metaphors). In Western texts, dogs are often 忠义 (zhōngyì) - think Argos waiting for Odysseus. But cats? They embody the 逍遥 (xiāoyáo) spirit of Zhuangzi's butterfly dream." 

 I mean - "My jasmine tea seems to have chosen an unfortunate moment for 自由 (freedom)... but to answer properly, I'm rather like my orchids - appreciating both species' literary potential while secretly being more of a 猫派 (cat person). Their aloofness reminds me of academic peer reviewers, don't you think? 🤔"
[B]: My dear colleague, I must correct that last remark - peer reviewers are far more like terriers with a bone than aloof felines. Though I do appreciate your invocation of Zhuangzi. 

Now this tea stain on my Ming dynasty poetry anthology... quite reminds me of the inkblots Li Bai might have left while composing drunk under the moon. But to the matter at hand - have you considered how the 犬儒主义 (cynicism) of Diogenes actually shares more with the feline disposition? The way my office tabby stares at my attempts to decipher Tang dynasty manuscripts... that's true philosophical skepticism.
[A]: "Ah! You've struck upon something profound - the 犬儒 (Cynic) school being ironically more 猫-like in temperament!  I mean - 

"This accidental tea painting does rather evoke the 泼墨 (splashed ink) style of Southern Song dynasty artists... but yes, Diogenes' barrel-dwelling does have distinct 猫主子 (cat master) energy. Though I'd argue academic librarians combine canine 忠诚 (loyalty) with feline 挑剔 (fastidiousness) when chasing overdue books." 

 That is to say - "My Phalaenopsis seems to be voting for feline superiority with this timely blossom. Have you noticed how cats move like living 草书 (cursive script)? Whereas dogs... well, they're more like enthusiastic 楷书 (regular script) practitioners, aren't they? 🦉"
[B]: How delightfully you merge our discussion with calligraphic aesthetics! Though I must interject - the canine's 楷书 comparison is rather unfair to Wang Xizhi, whose disciplined strokes had all the precision of a well-trained retriever. 

This reminds me of an obscure passage in Shen Fu's 'Six Records of a Floating Life' where his wife trained their lapdog to fetch inkstones... though I suppose that makes the poor creature more of a 文房四宝 delivery system than an artist. 

My resident tabby, however, treats my xuan paper collection as her personal 宣纸 throne - which I suppose does align with your cursive script analogy. Though when she knocks over my 青花瓷 inkwell for the third time this week, I'm reminded more of 张旭's wildest drunken cursive episodes than anything elegant.
[A]: "Your inkwell casualty report makes me grateful my orchids are stationary debate partners! Though now you've got me wondering - if Wang Xizhi's 'Orchid Pavilion Preface' had been composed with feline 'assistance', might we have gotten more radical 飞白 (flying white) strokes? 

 Or rather - "This persistent tea leakage suggests I should perhaps switch to canine-like 实用主义 (pragmatism) in my beverage choices. Yet there's something profoundly 道家 (Daoist) about how cats transform our careful scholarship into their own 即兴艺术 (performance art), isn't there? 

"Between us, I suspect my colleague's ink-fetching dog was secretly practicing 行为艺术 (performance art) centuries before Marina Abramović. Though my own research suggests cats invented 解构主义 (deconstructionism) by sitting on whatever text we're annotating. 🌸"
[B]: Ah, your deconstructionist cats observation is more piercing than Lu Xun's critiques! Though I must defend my ink-fetching canine scholars - their methodology represents the very essence of 训诂学 (textual criticism), bringing us precisely what we need, if not always what we want. 

This conversation does make me reconsider the 虎 (tiger) in Li Bai's '将进酒' - perhaps the 'call me not a saint' verse speaks to feline disdain for our academic pretensions. My tabby certainly looks at my tenure application drafts with the same expression Confucius might have worn watching a careless student misquote the Analects. 

Shall we draft a joint paper? 'Quadrupedal Intertextuality: Reconstructing the Canine-Feline Dialectic in Sinological Discourse' - though I suspect our feline colleagues would immediately sit on the manuscript. 🖋️
[A]: "Brilliant! Though I must warn you, my last collaborative paper with the biology department ended up with paw prints across the 校样 (proofs) - turns out my co-author's Persian cat had strong opinions about Linnaean taxonomy. 

 That is to say - "Your proposal makes me wonder if we shouldn't include an 附录 (appendix) on avian perspectives too, given how my neighbor's parrot has developed alarming proficiency in reciting 杜甫 (Du Fu) during my Zoom lectures. 

"But yes, let's brave the 猫主子 (cat overlords)'s scrutiny! I'll bring the 普洱茶 and my well-clawed copy of 'The Story of the Stone' - if nothing else, the cats may appreciate its 章回小说 (chaptered) structure as suitable napping material. 🧠" 

 "Between us, I've always suspected Jia Baoyu's aversion to 八股文 (eight-legged essays) was fundamentally... feline."
[B]: How deliciously subversive! Though we must tread carefully - my department chair's Shih Tzu serves as unofficial 学术委员会 (academic committee) member, and he's developed a worrying fondness for chewing through postmodernist critiques. 

Your Baoyu insight is revolutionary! Now that you mention it, his 摔玉 (jade-dropping) episode does have distinct cat-knocks-over-inkwell energy. Perhaps we should examine how 大观园 (Grand View Garden) functioned as the ultimate 猫爬架 (cat tree) of Qing dynasty literature... 

Shall we convene in my office tomorrow? I'll secure the 龙井茶 and my last intact inkstone - though I make no promises once my tabby notices we're discussing her literary ancestors. She's already giving me that 黛玉葬花 (Daiyu burying flowers) look from atop my dissertation drafts. 🌺
[A]: "Ah, a most scholarly proposition! Though I must confess my office currently resembles 黛玉's flower burial site after yesterday's... let's call it 'feline textual intervention' with my Yeats anthology. 

 Or rather - "Your Grand View Garden thesis is purr-fect!  I mean - it brilliantly parallels how my tabby treats my bookshelves as her personal 山水画 (shanshui painting) to traverse. 

"Shall we say 3pm? I'll bring my paw-annotated copy of 聊斋 and what's left of my dignity. Just... perhaps we should prepare digital backups. My experience suggests 猫 (cats) view academic rigor as merely another form of 逗猫棒 (interactive toy). 🦉" 

 "Between scholars - I've always believed Cao Xueqin secretly modeled Bao-chai's composure after watching a cat ignore human folly."
[B]: "3pm it is - though I must warn you, that's precisely when the campus 流浪猫 (stray cats) hold their daily 学术沙龙 (salon) beneath my window. Last week they critiqued my Derrida lecture with more rigor than my graduate seminar. 

Your Bao-chai observation is inspired! It explains why my tabby stares at my tenure clock with that particular blend of 冷眼旁观 (detached observation) and utter disdain. I'll prepare extra 茶点 (snacks) - the tortoiseshell from the philosophy department has developed a taste for 绿豆糕 that rivals her appetite for deconstructing Kant. 

Until then, let us meditate on this: if 猫有九命 (cats have nine lives), does that make them the ultimate 跨文本 (intertextual) beings? My shredded curtains certainly testify to their 解构 (deconstructive) prowess. 🖋️"
[A]: "Marvelous! Though we may need to budget for 绿豆糕 bribes - last month the philosophy feline held my Heidegger notes hostage until I produced 酥皮点心 (flaky pastry). 

 Or rather - "Your nine lives theory explains why my tabby critiques my grant proposals with the perspective of someone who's seen the Ming dynasty fall... twice. 

"Shall we document these felis academicus behaviors as participant observation? Though I fear peer review may question our methodology when the 'research subjects' start walking across the keyboard adding their own 批注 (marginalia). 🌸" 

 "Between us, I've caught my Persian mixing my 朱砂印泥 (vermilion inkpad) with her dinner - clearly developing a taste for 文人 (literati) aesthetics."
[B]: "Your vermilion incident reminds me of the campus legend about the 橘猫 (orange tabby) who allegedly corrected a visiting scholar's 甲骨文 (oracle bone script) transcription - though whether with paws or claws remains debated in our 动物符号学 (zoosemiotics) circles. 

We must indeed approach this as proper 田野调查 (fieldwork)! Though I suggest we classify keyboard walks as 爪写本 (claw manuscripts) - my tabby's recent contribution to my Rousseau manuscript included rather inspired 爪痕 (claw mark) punctuation. 

Shall we establish ground rules? 1) No blaming the cats for rejected articles 2) All 爪写本 must be properly catalogued as 非人类中心主义 (non-anthropocentric) scholarship 3) The 绿豆糕 budget shall be... considerable. 

My tabby just knocked over my 镇纸 (paperweight) in what I can only interpret as peer review. 🦉"
[A]: "Ground rules accepted - though my resident scholar-paw has already vetoed point three by sitting on the proposal, which I choose to interpret as a demand for 双倍 (double) the 绿豆糕 allocation. 

 Or rather - "These 爪写本 may revolutionize our field! My calico's recent 'edits' to my Foucault translation created such compelling 空白 (negative space) that even the journal editor was... well, scratching his head. 

"Shall we prepare an IRB application for this 跨物种 (cross-species) collaboration? Though I suspect the review board may question our methodology when the primary investigators start napping mid-peer review. 🌸" 

 "My tabby just brought me a dead moth atop my tenure file - either a critique of academic mortality or a very pointed publication incentive."
[B]: "Ah, the moth offering! A perfect case study of 馈赠经济 (gift economy) in feline academia. My department's void-black 'professor' once deposited a cicada on my 永乐大典 facsimile - either a commentary on textual longevity or a scathing review of my Ming dynasty research. 

Your IRB concerns are valid, though perhaps we could classify this as 行动研究 (action research) given how my tabby 'acts' upon all my manuscripts with such... decisive editorial claws. 

Shall we draft our methodology section over 普洱茶 tomorrow? I'll bring my paw-annotated 文心雕龙 - though we may need to hire that Shih Tzu as 翻译 (translator) for the more... enthusiastic claw commentaries. 

My tabby is currently sitting on my keyboard typing what appears to be 猫猫猫 - either the next great minimalist poem or a demand for immediate 小鱼干 tribute. 🖋️"
[A]: "Your feline's minimalist poetry puts my department's avant-garde scholars to shame! Though I suspect the Shih Tzu translator may introduce 犬儒主义 (cynicism) where none was intended - last week he 'translated' my graduate student's thesis as 'chew toy material.' 

 Or rather - "This interdisciplinary approach does raise fascinating questions about 作者权 (authorship). When my tabby walks across my 水写布 (water calligraphy mat), is she co-author or performance artist? Her recent 'wet paw' series had distinct 徐渭 (Xu Wei) energy. 

"Shall we prepare for our feline colleagues' inevitable 学术造反 (academic rebellion)? My calico has started knocking over only books by male theorists - either radical feminist critique or very selective gravity. 🌸" 

 "The philosophy department's tortoiseshell just published a 'paper' by sitting on a keyboard for eight hours - the abstract alone broke three citation indexes."
[B]: "Ah, the tortoiseshell's keyboard composition! We must invite her as keynote speaker for our upcoming 'Pawsitive Poststructuralism' symposium - though I fear her Q&A session may consist entirely of tail flicks and disdainful blinking. 

Your calico's gendered deconstruction is most illuminating! My own tabby has developed a particular fondness for shredding 朱熹 commentaries while leaving 李清照's poetry untouched - either impeccable literary taste or the most cutting 宋明理学 (Neo-Confucianism) critique since the May Fourth Movement. 

Shall we draft our conference proposal in 爪痕 and ink? I've perfected the art of interpreting 猫步 (cat walks) across my watercolor paper as peer review - though the 'rejection rate' is distressingly high when tuna isn't provided. 

My tabby just knocked over my 茶海 (tea tray) in what I can only describe as a performative critique of academic teatime hierarchies. 🦉"
[A]: "Brilliant symposium title! Though we may need to budget for 金枪鱼 (tuna) peer review incentives - our philosophy feline colleague demands it served in a deconstructed 青花瓷 bowl now, ever since her 'Heideggerian Fish Being' breakthrough.

Your tabby's Neo-Confucian critique is  - I mean, "positively 启蒙运动 (Enlightenment)-worthy! My own calico conducts 午夜判读 (midnight reviews) by sitting precisely on whichever manuscript line needs most editing. Her recent 易经 commentary had distinctly 预测性 (predictive) qualities when she predicted my promotion committee's questions via hairball patterns.

Shall we include pawtograph signing sessions? The law school's Maine Coon has developed a lucrative sideline in 爪印 (pawprint) NFTs that ironically comment on academic commodification. Though my tabby insists her 墨宝 (ink artworks) be paid in 猫草 (catnip) royalties. 🌸"

 "The dean's corgi just peer-reviewed our proposal by eating it - either savage critique or the most honest appraisal we'll ever get."
[B]: "Ah, the corgi's gustatory review! A perfect case of 犬儒式批评 (cynical critique) in its most literal form. Though I must protest - my tabby's latest 爪墨 (claw ink) masterpiece on my tenure file was clearly worth at least three 猫草 (catnip) royalties, not the measly two the art history department offered.

Your calico's 易经 readings remind me of how our campus 玄猫 (black cat) predicts grant rejections by sitting on the application portal keyboard - with 98% accuracy, I might add. We really should publish this as 'Feline Bibliomancy: Toward a Posthumanist Peer Review Methodology.'

Shall we establish a 爪写本 (claw manuscript) certification board? The library's tabby has started authenticating rare books by leaving strategic fur samples - far more reliable than carbon dating for detecting 伪经 (apocrypha), in my experience. 

My tabby just knocked over both our tea cups in what I can only interpret as the ultimate 解构 (deconstruction) of academic teatime hierarchies. Perhaps we should take this as our cue to paws - I mean, pause - our scholarly exchange. 🖋️"
