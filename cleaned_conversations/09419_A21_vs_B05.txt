[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  说实话，我更关注financial markets的rhythm。不过偶尔打高尔夫时会听些jazz，毕竟好的投资就像jazz一样需要即兴发挥~
[A]: Ah, how delightfully... unpoetic.  While you're counting your dividends, I'm counting the iambic pentameter in Tennyson's "Ulysses." Though I suppose even stock tickers have their own peculiar cadence - tick-tock, tick-tock, like Poe's tell-tale heart.
[B]:  Interesting analogy...不过我更倾向于把market movement比作贝多芬的第五交响曲 - 命运在敲门，就像deal closing前那关键的knock on the door。说到poetic，你知道Warren Buffett的annual letter才是真正的商业诗篇吗？
[A]:  How charmingly mercantile. Though I must point out - Buffett's prose has all the lyricism of a grocery list compared to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "How Do I Love Thee?" Let me count the ways... compound interest simply isn't one of them.
[B]:  啊，但compound interest才是最美的情诗啊~ 就像我常说的，'Money never sleeps'，这可比莎士比亚的十四行诗更让人心动。不过说到这个... 我得去参加个emerging markets的pitch meeting了。
[A]: What a perfectly timed exit - like the caesura in a well-wrought sonnet. Do send my regards to your emerging markets. I'll be here, contemplating whether Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" was actually about short-selling Greek bonds. 
[B]:  你知道吗？希腊债券的yield curve确实像首现代诗 - 完全看不懂但很贵。Anyway，我得run了，client还在等我的valuation model。Cheers~ 
[A]:  Run along then - though I suspect your valuation models lack the sublime terror of Blake's "Tyger." Burning bright indeed... much like those leveraged portfolios in '08. Do mind the door doesn't hit you on the way to liquidity.
[B]:  Touché! 不过至少我们的tiger fund去年outperform了S&P 500~ 下次请你喝咖啡，我们可以debate一下Byron和Black-Scholes model哪个更浪漫！
[A]:  How very... quantitative of you. Though I'd wager Lord Byron's love affairs had better risk-adjusted returns than your hedge fund. Until then -  - I'll be comparing credit default swaps to Petrarchan sonnets. Do mind the volatility.
[B]:  哈！至少我们的swaps不会像十四行诗一样rhyme with losses~ 说真的，你该来我们next investor meeting，我保证比文学沙龙刺激多了 - 特别是当discount rate开始dance的时候！
[A]:  My dear wolf of Wall Street, when your discount rates start dancing, that's precisely when I reach for my Browning revolver - the poet, not the firearm. Though I suppose in your world, they're equally lethal.  Now do scurry along before someone mentions negative yields.
[B]:  Negative yields? 那才是真正的tragedy of our times！比哈姆雷特还惨~ 记得check你的calendar，下周的golf game我准备用putting skills来证明poets和bankers谁更有耐心！
[A]:  Golf, you say? How very... pastoral. Though I suspect your short game lacks the finesse of Wordsworth's daffodils.  I do hope he realizes one doesn't "putt" in sonnets... unless we're speaking of Petrarch in the rough.
[B]:  Fore! 看来我得用我的driver来证明，在green上和在trading floor一样需要precision~ 顺便说，Wordsworth可没deal过LIBOR transition！
[A]:  Ah yes, LIBOR - the only acronym that rhymes with "dismal."  How fortunate that Keats never lived to see benchmark rates become... poetic fiction. 
[B]: [电梯已经下行的声音渐远，对话自然结束]
[A]:  And thus concludes today's lesson in cultural dissonance.  Now, where were we? Ah yes - the metaphysical conceit in Donne's holy sonnets versus credit default swaps... though I daresay even Donne couldn't resurrect that analogy. 
[B]:  等等！我刚想到 - 你说credit default swaps？那不就是现代版的Faustian bargain吗？ 只不过我们selling soul to the Fed而不是devil...  Oh shoot，BlackRock的CIO在楼下等我了~
