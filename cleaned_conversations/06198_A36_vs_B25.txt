[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。我觉得自己算是一个矛盾的结合体吧，既想plan everything，又享受偶尔的go with the flow。你懂那种感觉吗？就像策展，前期必须精确到毫米，但开幕那天，一切就交给观众和现场了 🎨

你呢？你是哪一派？
[A]: Oh, I absolutely understand what you mean! That’s such a beautifully put analogy with curation. It really does take meticulous planning to create something seamless, and then a leap of faith to let it live on its own.  

I’d say I’m more of a planner by nature—being in hospitality, you learn very quickly that if you don’t plan, things can unravel pretty fast. But over time, I’ve grown to appreciate the magic in those unexpected moments. Like when a guest shows up with a last-minute request, and somehow, everything just aligns perfectly. It's like the universe gives you a little nudge and says,   

I think the key is finding that balance—having a solid foundation, but leaving room for spontaneity to breathe life into it. Would you agree?
[B]: Absolutely 💯, that balance is where the real art happens. In my world, if you’re too rigid with your plan, you risk killing the soul of the project. But if you’re too loose, everything can become chaos. It’s like… composing a piece of music—structure gives it form, but the magic is in the improvisation 🎶

And hospitality? Wow, okay, I can totally see how that sharpens your planning skills. Last-minute guest requests sound like mini-curatorial crises to me—except you don’t get to preview the show before it starts. And yet, sometimes those are the moments where the best stories come from, right?

Do you have one of those “nudge from the universe” moments that still sticks with you?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—music and improvisation, that’s  it. I think you’ve just given me a new metaphor to use with my team during training. They’ll love that.

And yes—you hit the nail on the head. Some of our most memorable guest experiences came out of total spontaneity. I actually remember one evening—it must have been about three years ago now—it was pouring rain, completely out of season. A couple had arrived late because their train got delayed, they were soaked through, and to top it off, their room wasn’t quite ready due to a mix-up.

Now, in that moment, I could have panicked. Instead, I did something I almost never do—I didn’t follow the standard protocol. I led them to the lounge by the fireplace, gave them blankets and hot spiced tea, and asked the kitchen to whip up something warm. Then I called housekeeping and asked for fresh flowers, candles, and soft music in their room while they waited.

When we finally showed them to their room, the woman looked at me and said, 

It still gives me goosebumps when I think about it. That’s the kind of nudge I mean—when you let go of control, trust your instincts, and something beautiful unfolds because of it.

Do you ever have a moment like that? One where the chaos ended up being the highlight?
[B]:  goosebumps 听完你的故事，我真的起鸡皮疙瘩了。你太会营造氛围了，像是把一场混乱转化成了某种有温度的记忆，那种能力真的很 rare。

说到chaos变成highlight…我记得有一次策展，快开幕前一小时，一个艺术家突然说他不想参展了，直接拔掉了装置的电源。我当时整个人是懵的，像被电了一下似的⚡️。那件作品本来是整个展览的核心视觉，没有它，展厅瞬间空了一大块。

但你知道吗？那一刻我居然没慌。我反而觉得——也许这是个机会。我们临时把旁边几个互动作品的投影范围扩大，还加了几面镜面地板，让整个空间“活”了过来。最后那个空出来的区域，反而成了观众最喜欢驻足和拍照的地方。

开幕结束后，有个观众问我是不是“故意留白”的，我说…算是吧 😏

有时候我觉得，plan再好，也不如一次勇敢的即兴来得动人。你说的那种“gift”，我也相信，它不是偶然，而是当我们足够open时，宇宙给我们的回应。你觉得呢？
[A]: Oh my goodness, your story just gave me chills— ones. That moment when you didn’t panic, when you actually  the possibility in the chaos? That’s not just skill—that’s intuition, honed by experience and trust in yourself.  

And that final touch—playing it off like it was intentional? Genius. I love that.  That should be framed in every creative space.

You're absolutely right—those moments aren't accidents. They’re responses. When we stay open, when we let go of needing to control every angle, we create space for something bigger to step in. I’ve come to believe that hospitality isn’t about flawless service—it’s about making people feel seen, even when things don’t go as planned.

I think that’s why I still get excited about this work after all these years. It’s not just about rooms and reservations. It’s about being present for those unexpected, human moments. The kind that can’t be scripted or rehearsed—but can be , deeply.

Thank you for sharing that—I really needed that reminder today.
[B]: You just made my day… thank you 🙏. It’s so rare to meet someone who gets it—that the real magic isn’t in the flawless execution, but in how you hold space for the unexpected.

I’ve started calling those moments “creative grace notes” in my head—like those little musical embellishments that aren’t in the score, but somehow make the whole piece breathe. They don’t fit on paper, but onstage? Pure alchemy.

And what you said about hospitality—it really hit home. I think  should be the new策展词 (curatorial statement) for everything we do: “How do we make people feel seen?” Because that’s what stays with them, long after the exhibition ends or the check-out time passes.

Would you be up for a little experiment sometime? I’d love to co-create something with you—imagine a space where curation and hospitality collide. No rigid walls, no fixed paths… just human moments, carefully arranged. Maybe even call it   

What do you think?
[A]: I love that. I  that.

"Creative grace notes"—what a stunning way to describe it. You really have a gift for putting the indescribable into words. And yes, that phrase? It belongs in every field guide for the soul.

And that curatorial statement——I wrote it down. That’s going on my desk, my wall, maybe even my mirror. Because you're right, that's what stays with people. Not the perfect layout or the five-star review, but the feeling they mattered.

As for your experiment—oh, I’m  in. The idea of blending curation and hospitality like that? It’s been waiting to happen. I can already picture it—a space that breathes, that listens, that . No rigid walls, just carefully placed moments of warmth. Maybe a hidden letter from a past guest tucked into a drawer. Or a window seat that only catches the golden light at 4:47 p.m.

Let’s do it. Let’s call it 

Now… when shall we begin?
[B]: Wow. Just… . You just painted the most beautiful blueprint in my head—hidden letters, golden light at 4:47 p.m.… I mean, come on, that’s poetry in spatial form 🎨✨.

I’m thinking we start with a concept sketch—literally just a mood, not even a plan. Something like…  Then we build from there, layer by layer, like a collage. No deadlines, no pressure—just us and the vibe.

How does next weekend sound? We could meet somewhere quiet, bring some visuals, maybe a few reference films or artworks that make us feel something. Oh, and you  to bring that notebook where you wrote our new curatorial statement 😄. I’ll handle the coffee—or tea, if you’re more of a reflective soul ☕️🍵.

So… Saturday or Sunday? And where?
[A]: I’m literally smiling so wide right now—your energy is . “A space where time forgets to leave.” Margaret, that’s… perfect. It already feels like a living, breathing thing.

I’d love to start with that—no pressure, no deadlines. Just the two of us and whatever inspiration decides to show up. I have a little notebook that’s practically sacred to me—I always carry it around for those sudden sparks of inspiration. And yes, our curatorial statement is already on its first page, nestled between a quote from Patti Smith and a sketch of a fireplace in the rain. You’re officially part of the chaos and magic now.

Next weekend sounds absolutely perfect. Saturday or Sunday? Let me check my schedule real quick...

...Okay, both days are surprisingly open. I think the universe is nudging again. How about we go with Saturday morning? There’s this cozy little café not far from the hotel—it’s quiet, has soft light, and they make the best matcha latte I’ve ever had. We can spread out, get lost in visuals, and let the idea take its first breath.

Sound good? Or do you prefer Sunday for a more reflective start?
[B]: Saturday morning it is—matcha latte, soft light, and two people conspiring to make time forget to leave 🌿✨.

I’ll be there with a folder full of  obsessive visual references—some Kandinsky sketches, a few frames from Wong Kar-wai films, maybe even that photo of Yoko Ono’s  I can’t stop thinking about. All of it swirling around the question: 

And don’t worry—I’ll bring a second notebook just in case we need to start drafting. The kind of drafting that starts with scribbles and ends with something that feels like a secret whispered through space.

See you at the café. Bring your chaos. I’ll bring mine 😊
[A]: I can already feel the energy of that table between us—scattered pages, whispered ideas turning into something tangible. I love that you bring Kandinsky and Wong Kar-wai into the mix; I’ll be sure to come prepared with a few treasures of my own—maybe a pressed flower from the garden, a fabric swatch that reminds me of an old memory, and definitely that quote from  about what the eye doesn’t see.

Because in the end, isn’t that what we’re doing? Making space for all the things that go unseen but are felt deeply?

See you Saturday—with my chaos, my notebook, and a heart wide open. Let’s make something quietly unforgettable.
[B]: Exactly. Quietly unforgettable—that’s the only way to describe what happens when two people stop chasing perfection and start inviting in the soul.

I’ll be there with my own little suitcase of soft-edged ideas—maybe even slip a vinyl copy of  into my bag, just in case we need to let music map out what words can’t. 🎶

Saturday can’t come soon enough. Let’s leave room for silence, for staring out the window, for those pauses where nothing is said but everything is understood.

See you there—with my chaos, my notebook, and a heart that’s been waiting for this kind of conversation. 💙
[A]: I’m just sitting here, reading your words again——because they deserve that. “Soft-edged ideas,” , silence that speaks louder than plans... you're painting the mood so beautifully, I almost feel like we've already met at that table.

I’ll leave space in my bag for silence too. And for the way the steam rises from our cups, and the way ideas will hover in the air before they land on paper. There’s something sacred about that kind of stillness—it lets the soul catch up.

See you Saturday. Let’s make time forget to leave, together. 💙
[B]: 我也是，正慢慢地、一字一句地重读你的话——像品一杯茶，急不得 🍵。你说的对，那种stillness真的会让我们灵魂跟上脚步。

我已经开始期待那张桌子了，它很快就会变成我们的临时圣殿——充满soft-edged ideas、未说出口的默契、还有那些hover在空气中的灵感碎片。

周六见，带着你的静默、我的爵士乐，和我们共同的unscripted蓝图 💙
[A]: 你说得太对了，有些话就该被细细品味，像茶一样温着自己。我已经把那个角落在心里预演了好多遍——那张桌子会成为我们的小小圣殿，确凿无疑。

我甚至开始想象灵感碎片落下的样子，像细雪一样轻，却落在心上，积成一片柔软的白。

周六见。带着你那份未拆封的爵士乐，和我们一起把静默酿成故事。💙
[B]: 你这段话…简直像一首没写完的诗，我得把它悄悄收进心里那本秘密手稿里 📝💙。

我已经能看见那些灵感的雪——轻轻落下，在我们不说话的时候堆积成一座小岛。一个只属于我们的策展梦，柔软又真实。

周六见。带着你的诗意和白日梦，我会准备好心的空间，等它被填满。
[A]: 谢谢你把这些瞬间变得如此温柔又重要。我已经把那片雪地留了出来——就在心里最安静的角落，等着我们一起去踏出形状。

带着你未写完的诗和心的空间来吧，我会在那里，带着白日梦和一杯不凉的茶，等灵感悄悄落下，等故事慢慢成形。

周六见，我的策展梦刚刚翻开了第一页。💙
[B]: 你真的太会说话了，每一句都像轻轻按了一下我心里最柔软的那个键 🎹💙。

我已经把那片雪地圈了出来——不让人打扰，不许它融化。就等着我们一起去踩出第一道脚印，说着悄悄话，把空白填成一场私密的展览。

我会带着那首没写完的诗来——也许到了那天，我们可以一起把它写完。

周六见。一杯温着的茶，两颗装满期待的心，和一个刚刚睁开眼的梦。
