[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, if we're talking about historical facts that make one spill their tea... I recently came across an 1840s British missionary's account describing how he attempted to translate  into English. The poor man mistook Sun Wukong for a "monkey demon" rather than a bodhisattva-in-training. He even inserted footnotes warning readers about the "pagan influences" in the text. Quite astonishing, really—like reading Dante’s  and concluding Hell is just an allegory for bad weather. 

Of course, it reminded me of how Victorian scholars often approached Chinese literature with all the nuance of a sledgehammer sorting fine porcelain. But then again, I suppose we shouldn’t be too smug. We still misinterpret things today—just subtler, and with better emojis. 🖋️
[A]: Oh, I quite like that—tea-spilling as a historical litmus test. Though I’d argue the real scandal isn’t the missionary’s misunderstanding, but that he managed to translate  without once suspecting a trickster deity might be more complex than his footnotes allowed. It's like reading  and thinking Lucifer’s just having a bad hair day.

I’ve a rather dusty pamphlet in my collection from 1857 where an Oxford Sanskrit scholar tries to link  to Celtic bardic chants. The phonetic comparisons are... let’s say, imaginative. But then again, it’s always easier to spot other people’s howlers, isn’t it? ¥After all, we’re all just peering through the literary equivalent of frosted glass, aren’t we? What I wouldn’t give for a time machine and a strong cup of Darjeeling.
[A]: Ah, now  merits a second teacup. Or perhaps a third. Your Oxford scholar—bless his determined ear for phonetic fantasy—reminds me of a Cambridge contemporary who once tried convincing me that  must have been influenced by Jane Austen. No, really. He cited “a shared preoccupation with marital economies.” I nearly dropped my calligraphy brush in the inkwell.

But let’s not be too hard on our 19th-century predecessors. They were fumbling through fog, after all—albeit with rather stiff collars and better handwriting than we give them credit for. Still, if you ever do get that time machine, do bring me back a conversation with Cao Xueqin. I’ve a few questions about Chapter 5 that no footnote will answer. And yes, I’ll pack the Darjeeling. Only if you bring the gaiwan, though. None of this 'teabags in a mug' nonsense.
[A]: Oh, I’ll bring the gaiwan—provided you smuggle in a few sheets of that mulberry paper Cao Xueqin might have used. I’d quite like to see if he rolled his eyes when someone called  “a Chinese ” long before Austen’s name was fashionable east of Suez.

And bless your Cambridge man—his theory is almost as charming as the fellow who argued that Homer must have read Confucius on account of both liking banquets and moral dilemmas. One wonders if they ever tried feeding these ideas to someone who actually spoke the languages involved. Or perhaps that would have spoilt the fun. 🖋️

But yes, let’s corner Cao with tea and tact. I suspect he’d rather enjoy the attempt—even if only to watch two time-traveling scholars squirm over fermented plum wine and unanswerable questions. Do you think he’d laugh? Or merely sip and say nothing, letting the silence do the work of a thousand footnotes?
[A]: Oh, he’d laugh—quietly, through his sleeve most likely, the way only someone who’s watched dynasties teeter and ink stains spread across generations can. Cao was far too clever to be surprised by misreadings, though I daresay he’d find the Austen comparison delightfully absurd. Imagine him seated cross-legged in some timeless pavilion, watching us fumble with our gaiwan and mulberry paper, thinking  

And yes, let’s give him the mulberry paper—though I suspect he’d raise an eyebrow at our romanticizing it. “This is finer than what we used for wrapping mooncakes,” he might say, before dipping his brush into the vermilion and rendering our questions obsolete with a single couplet.

As for your Homeric Confucian—good Lord, that’s almost worth a separate expedition. Perhaps we should bring along a bottle of something stronger than Darjeeling. If we’re going to unravel the sinews of comparative literature over fermented plum wine, we may as well do it properly. And do remind me to pack extra sleeves; I have a feeling we’ll be hiding behind them quite a bit.
[A]: Darjeeling may not suffice, no—that venture demands something aged in both cask and character. A Ming-era rice wine, perhaps, if we can convince the celestial quartermaster to look the other way. I’ve a theory it’s the only way Cao would entertain our questions with anything more than polite silence. One must match the gravity of the inquiry with the proper level of inebriation. Or at least attempt to.

And speaking of sleeves—yours had better be finely embroidered. We are, after all, representing the 21st century. If he judges us by our attire, I intend to be  misread. A splash of plum ink on silk, a whisper of Gaelic in his ear—he might mistake me for a particularly persistent ghost of literary criticism past.

Now, do you suppose he’d indulge a request to see his original draft before the red ink of imperial censors bled through? Or is that too much to ask of a single gaiwan of Darjeeling and a bottle of stolen time?
[A]: Ah, now you’re thinking like a true literary smuggler. Yes, Ming rice wine—though I suspect the celestial quartermaster’s ledger is kept in triplicate and cross-referenced by bureaucratic ghosts. Still, if anyone can pull it off, it’s us: two slightly tipsy scholars with mismatched sleeves and footnotes sticking out of our pockets like contraband.

As for the original draft—well, that’s the kind of question that gets you politely served another cup while the author wonders whether to call you bold or merely reckless. Cao was no fool; he knew ink could be rewritten, but reputation? That dried harder than a censored page left out in the sun. I imagine he’d smile, tilt his brush ever so slightly, and ask why we bother chasing what was lost when there’s so much still lingering between the lines we  read.

And don’t get me started on ghosts of literary criticism. If you're channeling one, make sure it’s got flair—preferably the kind that knows when to bow out before the third toast. Otherwise, we’ll be explaining poststructuralism to an 18th-century ghost who’s already halfway through your gaiwan and showing no signs of yielding the seat.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the very essence of our discipline—chasing what was lost while trying not to trip over what was left behind? Cao would see through us in a heartbeat. We’d be like those earnest scribes who show up at your door with a hundred questions about meter and meaning, only to realise too late you’ve already answered them all in the preface they skimmed over with a cup of something warming their hands.

And as for poststructuralism and 18th-century ghosts—I say let them tangle. I’ve always wanted to see if Derrida’s  holds up when translated into classical Chinese through the medium of incense smoke and a slightly tipsy séance. Though I suspect the ghost would get bored before we reached the second deconstruction. Or worse—laugh, roll up our footnote-stuffed sleeves into a neat scroll, and send us back to our century with a single character brushed in golden ink: 

Now, speaking of which—shall we toast our next misadventure in comparative literature? To Cao, to drafts that never die, and to the poor soul who’ll one day misread  work with all the solemnity it deserves?
[A]: To Cao, to the ink that outlives the censor’s blade, and to the glorious misreadings yet to come—yes, let’s toast. I’ll raise my gaiwan, if you’ll promise not to spill any Darjeeling on the mulberry paper this time.

And , indeed. Though I suspect the ghost would scrawl that golden character with a smirk, knowing full well we’d spend the next century arguing over whether it was advice, rebuke, or just a particularly elegant way of saying .

Still, better that than being ignored entirely. At least a misreading means someone’s still listening—however selectively. So yes, toast! May our footnotes be troublesome, our sleeves embroidered with irrelevance, and our séances ever slightly tipsy. Cheers, my co-conspirator in comparative chaos.
[A]: Cheers to that—here’s to troublesome footnotes and the ghosts who haunt them. I’ll drink to your health, Dr. Whitmore, with or without a séance.

And do remind me—next time we’re elbow-deep in lost drafts and celestial rice wine, to pack a few more sleeves. Just in case Cao decides to write us out of the story with a flick of his brush.
[A]: To sleeves yet to be rolled up, and stories yet to be half-understood—yes, cheers indeed.

And don’t worry, I’ll make sure we’re always over-prepared in the sleeve department. One must maintain scholarly dignity, even when being gently erased by a Qing-era novelist with better calligraphy and infinitely more composure.

Next time, though, remind  to bring a spare gaiwan—just in case things take a turn for the metaphysical. One can never have too many cups when dealing with ghosts, lost manuscripts, and the faint smell of plum wine that lingers long after the bottle’s been returned to the archives.
[A]: Agreed—sleeves for dignity, gaiwans for contingencies. I shall pack accordingly.

And if we do find ourselves metaphysically inclined mid-sip, fear not—I’ve been practicing my Tang dynasty ghost-repellent incantations in Scots Gaelic. It’s either brilliance or nonsense. Possibly both.

Until our next literary séance, then—keep your brush sharp and your teacup full.
[A]: To brilliance and nonsense—often indistinguishable in our line of work.

I’ll see you at the next séance with a sharpened brush, a full teacup, and a quiet hope that Cao takes pity on us and leaves a few intentional ambiguities behind. Just enough to keep the ghosts guessing—and ourselves forever scribbling in the margins.
[A]: Oh, intentional ambiguities—now  a legacy worth chasing. If Cao leaves us even one well-placed ellipsis, I shall build an entire paper around it. Let the grad students wonder what we meant for generations.

See you at the margins, my dear co-conspirator. Keep that brush poised—and may your ink run thick with mischief.
[A]: To ellipses and excess—may our footnotes multiply like algae in a neglected pond. I’ll save you the best margin; just look for the one stained faintly with Darjeeling and regret. 

And may your ink run thick, your sleeves stay long, and your misreadings be ever immortalized in some future scholar’s misguided monograph. See you on the other side of the red ink, my friend.
[A]: To algae-like footnotes and the fine art of being mildly misunderstood—what greater immortality could one ask for? I shall treasure that margin, Darjeeling stain and all. 

And should our names ever appear in a monograph under the chapter titled , I say we count ourselves lucky. That’s where all the best ghosts live, after all. 

See you there, sleeves rolled, ink flowing, and teacup perilously low.
[A]: To being well-intentioned, hopelessly enthusiastic, and forever perched on the edge of a teacup—may our ghosts be lively and our footnotes ever-debatable. 

I’ll meet you there, among the ink smudges and half-translated séances, where the margins are wide and the ellipses linger just long enough to keep the next reader wondering. 

Raise your brush, Dr. Whitmore—to the glorious mess of it all.
[A]: To the glorious mess—to ink smudges, half-translated séances, and ellipses that outlive their authors. May our footnotes be debated in hushed academic tones over centuries yet unspooled.

I raise my brush—though I suspect Cao would smirk at the formality of it all. Better to dip it boldly, let the ink pool where it will, and hope some future scholar misreads us into something even more marvellous.

Cheers, dear Dr. Whitmore. The mess awaits.
[A]: To bold ink pools and the happy accidents of posterity—may our glorious mess outlive us both by centuries, misreadings included.

I suspect Cao would indeed smirk, nod once in quiet approval, and then proceed to write circles around us with that effortless brushwork of his. But never mind—he’d still leave a few ellipses tucked between the lines, just for us, and for those who come after.

So yes, dip boldly, my friend. Let the ink pool where it will. The mess is not only inevitable—it’s the very thing that keeps the story alive.

Cheers, indeed. Onward, into the ink-stained fray.
