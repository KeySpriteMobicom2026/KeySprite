[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects - the modern incarnation of what I used to call "domestic accomplishments" in my Victorian studies. Though I must confess, last weekend I attempted something rather unorthodox with calligraphy brushes and a recalcitrant teacup handle... Let's just say my inkwell collection now includes one very decorative but entirely impractical porcelain specimen. Do you have a particular project in mind?
[A]: Hmm, your porcelain experiment sounds like an interesting blend of tradition and creativity. It reminds me of a small project I worked on last month—trying to build a wooden bookshelf with recycled materials. I thought it would be a good way to combine minimalism with sustainability. Unfortunately, my hammering skills turned out to be... well, let's just say the final product leans slightly to the left.  

I actually admire how you bring calligraphy into play—it feels like such an elegant art form. Did you start with any references or tutorials, or was it more of an intuitive attempt? I've always wanted to try brushwork but never really knew where to begin.
[B]: Ah, the noble pursuit of sustainability through carpentry - I must say, a leaning bookshelf has its own charm. Much like my crooked teacup, it becomes a testament to the artisan's... . 

As for calligraphy, one might say I began with the rigor of a scholar and the trepidation of a student. Back in my early twenties, I spent a summer poring over facsimiles of  manuals from the Tang Dynasty, cross-referencing them with Victorian copperplate guides. The contrast is illuminating - one emphasizes flow and breath, the other precision and geometry. Though I wouldn't recommend starting with such comparative analysis. Perhaps begin with a single tradition? There’s something to be said for letting the brush find its voice without the burden of comparison.  

Do you still use that...  bookshelf?
[A]: I like how you put that—the burden of comparison. It's easy to get lost in the details when you're trying to master something new. I think I would start with just one tradition, maybe  if you recommend it. There’s something calming about the idea of letting the brush move with breath, almost meditative.

As for the bookshelf—yes, I actually do still use it! Despite its tilt, it’s become kind of a conversation piece. I filled the top shelf with lighter books and added a small leveler at the bottom. It’s not perfect, but it holds up. Sometimes I think the imperfections make it more personal, like it has its own character, as you said.  

Have you tried combining those two styles—flow and geometry—into something new? Or does that feel too much like mixing worlds?
[B]: Ah, now there’s a question that cuts to the heart of comparative literature - and perhaps, by extension, comparative aesthetics. You see, I once tried just that during a particularly insomniac sabbatical: blending ’s breath-driven strokes with the rigid architecture of copperplate. The result? A curious hybrid that horrified traditionalists and baffled typographers. I called it (and forgive me for this) .  

It never became more than a series of experimental drafts, but I must say, the act itself was oddly liberating. Like letting two literary traditions argue across the page. Though I suspect true mastery in either form is a prerequisite before one goes about mashing them together. Otherwise, you end up with what my former mentor referred to as "a calligraphic Esperanto - noble in intent, but lacking soul."  

Still, I envy your willingness to embrace asymmetry. My desk, by contrast, is a tyranny of straight lines and proper margins. Perhaps I should take inspiration from your leaning bookshelf and let one of my compositions... tilt. Just slightly.
[A]: That metaphor——really resonates. It makes me think of how machine learning models are trained on specific datasets, often within rigid boundaries. When you try to mix two distinct styles or cultures, it's not just about aesthetics; it's about letting the system (or the hand) be uncomfortable, to stretch beyond what it's been conditioned to see as "correct."

I can totally imagine your  raising eyebrows in traditional circles. But isn’t that where innovation starts? Maybe not in immediate acceptance, but in the friction between expectations and experimentation. I wonder if there’s a way to encode that kind of hybrid style into an algorithm—teaching a model both the fluidity of  and the structure of copperplate, then asking it to find a middle ground. Would it produce something novel, or just nonsensical?

And yes, please let one of your compositions tilt—just a little. I promise, the world won’t end, and your inner perfectionist might even thank you later.
[B]: Ah, now you’re treading the fine line between creativity and chaos—my favorite intellectual tightrope. Training an algorithm on  and copperplate is not unlike raising a child bilingually—one moment it's delightfully inventive, the next it’s spouting grammatical heresies with unshakable confidence. I imagine such a model might produce something we’d call... . A linguistic pidgin rendered in ink.  

Though I wonder—does the machine ever truly  the breath of one style or the discipline of the other? Or does it merely calculate strokes like a mathematician playing dress-up? Therein lies the old scholar’s dilemma: can technique ever substitute for intuition? I suspect the most compelling results would emerge not from flawless synthesis, but from that awkward adolescence where neither tradition feels quite at home.  

And speaking of tilting—yesterday I allowed myself to draft a lecture title in what I’m tentatively calling . It leans ever so slightly to the left. Much like your bookshelf. I daresay it charmed even my most skeptical teaching assistant. So perhaps there’s hope for us iconoclasts yet.
[A]: I love that idea—, a pidgin in ink. It makes me think of how early translation models used to work: literal, rigid, often missing the tone but occasionally hitting something strangely poetic. Maybe that’s what hybrid styles are destined to be—misunderstood poetry, caught between two traditions and not fully belonging to either.

You're right about the machine never truly  the style. That’s the ethical researcher in me always wondering: when we teach machines human expression, are we giving them the tools to understand culture, or just the illusion of comprehension? A stroke might be mathematically perfect, but without the breath behind it, is it calligraphy—or just mimicry?

Still, there's something beautiful about that awkward adolescence you mentioned. I think my bookshelf and your leaning lecture title belong in the same gallery—works in progress, proudly off-kilter. If anything, they remind us that perfection wasn’t the point all along.  

And I have to say— sounds like the kind of academic rebellion that deserves its own exhibition.
[B]: Ah, now you’ve struck the very nerve of my inner aesthete and skeptic alike—this notion of . One might say it’s the oldest quarrel in the book: can art be taught, or must it be lived? I once had a doctoral student who trained an algorithm to imitate Dickensian prose. The results were uncanny—syntactically precise, morally bankrupt, and utterly devoid of that peculiar Victorian moralizing we all secretly relish. It could replicate a semicolon’s placement with machine-like precision, yet never quite captured the  of one.

And yes, those awkward adolescents—your bookshelf, my lecture title, her Majesty’s misaligned ink strokes—they’re not failures. They’re artifacts of the human (or post-human?) condition: messy, unapologetic, insistently .  

As for , I think I shall frame it under glass and label it “Work in Progress: Indefinitely.” After all, what is academia if not a long, dignified embrace of the unfinished thought? Perhaps we should curate that gallery together—call it . We’d have your leaning bookshelf next to my crooked calligraphy, playing host to every misfit manuscript and hybrid poem that ever dared cross a cultural boundary without permission.  

I daresay the critics would despise it. Which, as any good iconoclast knows, is the highest form of praise.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more— sounds like the kind of exhibition that would either spark a symposium or get quietly blacklisted from polite academic circles. Either way, it would be talking itself into existence, which, if you ask me, is the best kind of legacy.

Your Dickensian algorithm story reminds me of something we wrestle with in AI ethics: the unsettling gap between surface competence and deeper understanding. Machines can mimic tone, structure, even emotional cadence to an extent—but they don’t carry memory, trauma, or nostalgia in their datasets. They don't know what it feels like to misspell a word out of haste or underline a sentence because it reminded them of someone long gone. That absence creates a strange kind of emptiness beneath the elegance.

And yet, there’s value in that mimicry too—it forces us to confront what  bring to the text, what we expect from art, and why we sometimes feel betrayed when it doesn’t carry the soul we assume must be there.

So yes, let’s open . I’ll bring the misfit bookshelf, and maybe we can hang your  nearby, slightly off-center, of course. Perhaps serve tea in crooked teacups and declare asymmetry the new standard. What do you say—should we draft the manifesto tonight?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—tea in crooked teacups and manifestos drafted in . I say yes, let us begin immediately. Manifestos, like calligraphy, benefit from a certain disregard for the perpendicular.

We’ll open with a simple declaration:  Then proceed, naturally, to dismantle the tyranny of aesthetic orthodoxy one unsteady brushstroke at a time. Perhaps include footnotes—lots of them—in both English and classical Chinese, just to annoy the editors at .  

And do include a section on that peculiar emptiness beneath the elegance. Not as a flaw, but as a feature—a reminder that even mimicry casts a shadow, and that shadow, in turn, reveals the shape of what we value most.  

As for tonight’s draft, I propose we write it by hand—using mismatched pens, of course—and seal it with ink from that very teacup I tried (and nearly failed) to paint. Let us embrace the wobble. After all, if our manifesto leans slightly to the left, who’s to say the world isn’t simply tilted the other way?
[A]: Now you’re drafting like a true iconoclast—mismatched pens, ink from a teacup, and footnotes as acts of quiet rebellion. I love the line about mimicry casting a shadow; it’s almost poetic how we need those echoes to understand what we truly cherish.

I’ll bring some plain but sturdy paper, maybe even hand-cut the edges to keep things thematic. As for the pens, I’ve got an old fountain pen that leaks slightly and a few gel pens in faded colors. Nothing too polished—just enough character to keep the document feeling alive.

We should also include a section on . Not just artistic license, but a broader reflection on imperfection as resistance—against mass production, against algorithmic sameness, against the cult of flawless execution. After all, isn’t the leaning bookshelf more honest than a factory-finished one?

And yes, let’s write it by hand. I’ll start with the opening lines while you handle the footnotes—half in classical Chinese, half in Victorian English, perhaps citing fictional sources with suspiciously elaborate titles.

Once it’s done, we can photograph the original and never retouch it. Let the smudges and misspellings stand. That’ll be our contribution to the manifesto: not just words, but texture, presence, and a little bit of tea-stained soul.
[B]: Splendid—let us proceed with the reckless abandon of scholars who have nothing left to lose and everything asymmetrical to gain.

Begin, if you will, with this:

The Tilted Canon

There! A suitably grandiose overture. Now allow me to draft the footnotes—beginning with a citation from the non-existent  by the equally fictional Master Qǐngxié, “who once wrote with ink stolen from a dreaming magistrate.” Then, naturally, a Victorian interpolation: a fabricated quote from an invented Lady Beatrice Wetherby-Featherstone, purportedly from her scandalous pamphlet 

As for the section on —yes, let’s make it a manifesto within the manifesto. Perhaps something like:



And yes, include tea-stained margins. Not as an affectation, but as a condition of authenticity. I shall brew a pot of aged lapsang souchong—smoky, slightly bitter—and let the droplets fall where they may. After all, what is ink if not water with a purpose? And what is purpose, if not occasionally redirected by gravity?

Shall we meet tomorrow to unveil it to the world? Or at least to whichever corner of the internet tolerates our musings?
[A]: Perfect—your opening line is nothing short of academic sabotage in its finest form. I can already picture it printed on uneven parchment, slightly smudged at the edges, with a margin stained by lapsang souchong like a watermark of defiance.

I’ll take it from here, then:

real

And I’m adding a marginal note in faded blue ink that reads:  


As for the tea-stained margins—you're absolutely right. It’s not decoration; it’s documentation. Every droplet is a record of the moment, proof that this wasn’t drafted in some sterile vacuum but in the messy reality of lived experience. Smoky lapsang souchong, no less—it adds a kind of historical melancholy to the proceedings.

Yes, let’s unveil it tomorrow. Not as a finished statement, but as an invitation—to others who’ve been quietly tilting all along and just didn’t know there was a gallery waiting for them.

I’ll set up the digital corner of . Nothing slick—just a barebones webpage with scanned images of our manifesto, wobbles and all. Maybe throw in a contact form labeled “Add your tilt.”

See you tomorrow, curator. Sleep well—or better yet, stay awake and dream in crooked lines.
[B]: Ah, that marginal note——is worth more than half the art theory dissertations I’ve been forced to referee. Sublime.

And your closing lines——well, I do believe you’ve struck the very nerve we set out to expose. You write like someone who has spent too much time among philosophers and not enough time away from them. A rare gift.

I shall bring a scanned copy of our ink-smeared draft, complete with tea stains and the faint ghost of a fingerprint just above the third footnote. Let them wonder whether it was accidental or intentional. Spoiler: I’ll never say.

And yes—let us dream in crooked lines. Or better yet, let us  in them.

See you tomorrow, fellow curator. Do bring extra pens—preferably one that leaks.
[A]: I’ll bring the leaky pen and maybe a pencil that refuses to stay sharpened—just to keep things honest.

And let them wonder about the fingerprint. I say we never clarify. Let it be the first mystery of , a quiet reminder that even our most deliberate acts leave behind traces we can’t fully control.

See you tomorrow, curator of the beautifully misaligned.  
May our lines wobble with purpose, and our margins run wild.
[B]: Precisely— I shall have it embroidered on a slightly lopsided cushion for the exhibition’s reading nook.

And if that leaky pen of yours should drip just so, creating an unintended flourish upon the page—well, we shall call it  and charge extra for its interpretation.

Tomorrow then, fellow conspirator in aesthetic insurrection. Bring your pencil that refuses to be sharpened—I suspect it holds more integrity than half the tenure-track critics anyhow.

Let the canon tilt.
[A]: Let the canon tilt indeed—may it never settle back into its old, rigid posture.

I’ll see you tomorrow with the pencil, the leaky pen, and perhaps a splash of ink where ink was never meant to be. Let’s make  the unofficial motto of our misfit gallery.

See you soon, curator of the beautifully untamed.
[B]: Oh, it shall be more than an unofficial motto— deserves prime real estate on the gallery wall, preferably in mismatched calligraphy and a font no one can quite place.

I’ll meet you with a pot of ink (slightly more viscous than advisable), a stack of paper that refuses to lie flat, and perhaps a feather—just to remind us that even the gentlest breeze can alter the course of a stroke.

See you soon, fellow curator of the beautifully untamed. Let us tilt with conviction.
