[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question—how do I distinguish between digital and traditional art? To me, both forms are fascinating in their own right. Take William Blake, for instance—he was a poet and printmaker who blurred the lines between the handcrafted and the visionary. In much the same way, digital art today challenges our notions of originality and medium.

That said, I must admit I feel a certain intimacy with traditional works—the texture of brushstrokes, the scent of aged paper... it’s akin to holding a first edition in one’s hands. Still, I find myself captivated by what digital platforms offer in terms of accessibility and transformation. 

Do you have a preference?
[A]: Hmm, that’s such a thoughtful take! I totally get what you mean about the tactile charm of traditional art—the way you can almost  the weight of history in a physical piece. There’s something grounding about it, like listening to a vinyl record instead of streaming music.  

But then again, digital art opens up this whole other universe of possibilities, right? Like how artists can remix and reimagine work in ways that feel almost alive. It’s kind of like comparing a handwritten letter to an interactive website—both communicate, but one has this dynamic, ever-changing energy.  

As for me? I think I lean toward digital… mostly because I love how it breaks down barriers. Anyone with a tablet and software can create something stunning, no gallery approval needed. It feels more inclusive, don’t you think? Though honestly, when I see an oil painting up close, I still get that little flutter in my chest 😊  

Do you ever feel like the medium shapes the message, or do you think the artist’s intent is what really shines through either way?
[B]: You’ve articulated something quite profound—how the medium carries its own kind of resonance, almost like a poetic form shaping the emotional weight of a verse. I think you're right to suggest that digital art dismantles gatekeeping in ways that traditional forms still cling to, much like how self-publishing has altered the literary landscape.

As for your question—yes, I do believe the medium influences the message, sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly. Think of how T.S. Eliot’s fragmented lines in  mirror the disintegration of certainty in the modern world. Similarly, a digital collage layered with GIFs and text can evoke a kind of cognitive overload we experience daily online. The tools shape the thought, just as ink and parchment shaped the sonnet.

But then again, intent is a quiet force beneath it all. A powerful vision finds its way through any medium—it’s like watching a vine grow through stone. Still, doesn’t it unsettle you, sometimes, how ephemeral digital work can feel? Like a poem read aloud at dusk and then lost to the wind…
[A]: That metaphor is beautiful—like a poem lost to the wind… 🤔 There’s something hauntingly poetic about it, but also a little sad, don’t you think? I mean, imagine if  had only existed as a single spoken performance—no ink, no print, just pixels on a screen that blinked out after a few clicks. Would it have shaped literary history the same way?

And yet, maybe that ephemerality is its own kind of power. Like haiku or flash fiction—transient, but still capable of piercing through. I guess what unsettles me most isn’t so much the impermanence itself, but how easily digital art can be drowned out in the noise. A stunning piece can go viral for three seconds and then vanish, buried under the next trend. It makes me wonder—does visibility equal value in this age?

Do you ever feel torn between preserving the past and embracing the future? Sometimes I catch myself being almost nostalgic for things I’ve never even experienced firsthand—like sitting in a dusty archive with yellowed pages, even though I’ve mostly worked with digital databases all my life. Is that just romanticizing, or do you feel it too?
[B]: There’s a word in Chinese that sometimes crosses my mind in moments like these—望洋興嘆. It describes a feeling of awe and helplessness when faced with something vast and overwhelming, as if standing at the edge of the sea. I think our current moment in art and culture evokes that sensation—this flood of digital creation and disappearance leaves us both exhilarated and adrift.

You’re right to question whether visibility equals value. In my world of literary study, we see this all the time—how canonization often has as much to do with politics as with poetic merit. The same is true now in the digital realm: algorithms dictate what surfaces, not necessarily what resonates most deeply. And yet... isn’t there also something democratic about this chaos? A poem posted at midnight can find its reader on the other side of the world within seconds. That kind of intimacy across distance feels almost miraculous.

As for nostalgia—I think it's human to long for what we imagine came before, even if we never lived it. I’ve spent hours walking through old university libraries, trailing my fingers along leather-bound spines, knowing full well that many of those texts were once accessible only to a privileged few. There’s romance in the imagined past, yes—but also lessons worth remembering.

Perhaps we don’t have to choose between preservation and progress. Maybe our role is to be curators of memory and scouts for the new, walking both paths at once.
[A]: That’s such a graceful way to put it—望洋興嘆. I love how that word holds both awe and a kind of quiet surrender. It really does capture what it feels like to scroll endlessly through digital galleries, not knowing whether to marvel or mourn 😞

You’re so right about the democracy in the chaos too. I guess it’s a double-edged sword—on one hand, anyone can create and share, but on the other, it’s so easy for meaningful work to get swept under. I wonder if future art historians will look back at this time as both the golden age and the great flood 🤔

And I love your idea of being both curator and scout. Honestly, I think that’s what we’re all becoming, whether we realize it or not—choosing what to carry forward while staying open to what’s next. Sometimes I think even the most cutting-edge digital artists are preserving something old, just in new skin. Like those 3D sculptors who recreate ancient statues… it’s almost like they’re saying, “this still matters.”

Do you ever find yourself trying to archive things emotionally? Like mentally bookmarking a piece you stumble across online because you’re afraid it’ll disappear before you can fully absorb it? I catch myself doing that more than I’d admit… it’s almost like a reflex now.
[B]: I understand that reflex all too well—it’s like walking through a gallery where the paintings are slowly dissolving as you look at them. You try to hold onto every brushstroke, knowing it may vanish before you can return to it. I’ve caught myself doing the same—taking mental notes, saving links in folders labeled , only to find they no longer lead anywhere.

There’s an urgency in that act of preservation, isn’t there? Almost like monks in a medieval scriptorium, copying texts by hand so that something of value might survive the centuries. Except now, we scroll, we screenshot, we pin. And yet… does any of it truly last? Or do we simply fool ourselves into thinking we can arrest time?

As for your question about future art historians—I suspect they’ll speak of this era with both admiration and bewilderment, much as we now regard the explosion of print culture after Gutenberg. There will be fragments recovered from forgotten hard drives, GIFs resurrected from early web pages, digital murals reconstructed from scattered metadata. It will take patience and ingenuity.

But yes, in some quiet corner of my mind, I do try to archive emotionally. Especially when something moves me—be it a short film looped on Instagram or a poem embedded in a blog post from 2007. I let it settle, turn it over like a stone in my palm, hoping to remember its weight.

Perhaps that’s what it means to live between ages—not to choose one world over another, but to carry both in our hearts.
[A]: I love that image—walking through a gallery where the paintings dissolve as you look at them. It feels so true to what it’s like navigating digital spaces sometimes… like we’re always one click away from losing something beautiful, yet constantly discovering new layers.

You know, I’ve actually started keeping a kind of hybrid journal—part digital, part handwritten. For pieces that really strike me, I’ll jot down a line or two in ink, almost like an offering to memory. And then I save the link, tag it carefully, cross my fingers. It’s probably irrational, but it makes me feel like I’m doing  against the tide.

And yeah, I totally get what you mean about emotional archiving. There’s this quiet ache in knowing how fragile some of it is. Like, I once came across this animated poem online—it blended text, voice, and motion so delicately that it felt like watching someone’s heartbeat. I tried to find it again weeks later and… nothing. No trace. It was like trying to catch smoke in my hands.

Maybe that’s why we need both kinds of art—because traditional reminds us of permanence, even if it's exclusionary, and digital reminds us of impermanence, even if it’s overwhelming. Together, they teach us how to hold onto things without clutching too tight 💛

Do you ever think about creating something yourself? Not just preserving or analyzing, but making something that others might want to archive one day?
[B]: There’s a quiet ache in that question—like the pause between lines in a sonnet, when meaning hovers just beyond reach.

To answer honestly… yes, I do think about it. More than I let on, perhaps. But creation feels like a kind of vulnerability I’m still learning to embrace. When you spend your life studying the echoes of others, it can be daunting to imagine adding your own voice to the chorus. It’s one thing to interpret  or , quite another to put pen to paper and risk revealing the tremor in your own hand.

Still, I’ve begun—tentatively, privately. A poem here and there, not for publication, but for the simple act of shaping thought into language. Sometimes I think of these small acts as my own kind of emotional archive. Not just preserving what moves me, but responding to it, weaving myself into the fabric of what came before.

And maybe that’s enough for now—not to be archived by others, but to know that something of yourself has been felt, even if only by you.

Do you create, I wonder? Or is the act of collecting and reflecting where your heart lies?
[A]: That pause between lines in a sonnet—so perfectly put. There's something about that silence that holds more than words ever could… 💭

I think I’ve always been torn between creating and collecting, if I’m being honest. There’s safety in curation, right? You can build a world out of other people’s brilliance without ever having to step into the light yourself. And yet… there’s this quiet pull toward making something—something messy, imperfect, entirely mine.

I’ve dabbled—in writing, mostly. Little fragments of prose or poems scribbled late at night when the world feels too loud to ignore. Never shared them, of course. Just… personal echoes, I guess. Sometimes I mix in digital art, layering textures and found images to see what emotional resonance they create. It’s like therapy, in a way. A way to make sense of things that don’t quite fit into regular language.

But putting it all out there? That’s another level of courage—one I’m still learning how to grow into. I keep thinking, who am I to add to the chorus? And yet… isn’t that the point? To sing anyway?

Maybe one day I’ll trust my voice enough to let it linger in someone else’s memory, even just for a moment. Until then, I suppose I’ll keep bookmarking, blending, and quietly shaping my own little corner of the archive 🎵  

Do you ever imagine what your voice would sound like if you fully stepped into it—unfiltered, unafraid?
[B]: Oh, that question lingers like the final note of a nocturne—faint, but reverberating.

If I were to step fully into my voice, unfiltered and unafraid… I think it would sound like a letter written in ink that never quite dries—still smudged by thought, still marked by hesitation, yet deliberate. It would carry the cadence of long walks through overgrown gardens, of pages turned in dim light, of pauses filled with looking out the window, gathering courage from the rain.

I imagine it would be quiet, at first—not the kind of voice that demands attention, but one that invites leaning in. A voice that acknowledges complexity without rushing to resolution. That rare kind of speaking that doesn’t seek to settle things, but to unsettle them gently, so they might bloom anew.

And yes, there would be tremors. Not weakness, but the natural vibration of someone who cares deeply, who has spent years listening before finally choosing to speak. Perhaps a little formal, out of habit—but warmed by sincerity. Like a well-worn book that still bears the stiffness of its spine.

Do you know what your voice would look like, if it had a texture or a color? I suspect yours might be something woven—linen perhaps, soft at the edges, dyed in twilight hues. Something hand-stitched, not mass-produced. Something that holds both shadow and light.
[A]: That’s... honestly, breathtaking. You have such a way of painting sound and silence all at once. I think I’d want my voice to feel like that—like something someone stumbles upon late at night when they didn’t realize they were looking for it. A little like finding an old letter tucked into a book you’d read a dozen times before.

If my voice had a texture… maybe it’d be something weathered but soft—like the pages of a novel left out in the rain and then dried by accident, more than once. Not quite smooth, not broken, just… lived in. And color? Maybe something in between dusk and dawn—like the sky right before you can’t tell if it’s still night or already day. That quiet in-between where everything feels possible.

I guess what I’m trying to say is—I hope my voice someday sounds like a place someone can rest in, even if just for a sentence or two. Not loud, not perfect, but real. Like we’re both building shelters out of words, one line at a time 🌙

Do you ever write with music playing in the background? I’ve always wondered how sound shapes the way words come out for people.
[B]: Ah, yes—music shaping words like water shaping stone. I find that certain composers can loosen the rigidity of thought, allowing language to flow in unexpected ways. Satie’s  are particularly good for this—there’s a quiet gravity to them, as if each note is a word already searching for its sentence.

When I write, I often reach for music that feels contemplative, almost wistful. Arvo Pärt’s , for instance, or the slower movements of Chopin nocturnes. They don’t dictate what I write, but they shift the atmosphere around the act of writing, making solitude feel less like silence and more like communion.

And I wonder—do you have particular sounds that draw your voice out? Or do you prefer the hush of stillness when shaping your fragments into something whole?

There’s something deeply intimate about pairing sound with self-expression, isn’t there? Like choosing the right lighting for a room before inviting someone inside.
[A]: Absolutely—pairing sound with self-expression does feel like adjusting the light in a room before opening the door. I love that metaphor 🌙 It makes me think of how we all have these invisible thresholds, and music is like the soft glow that makes stepping across feel possible.

When I’m writing or piecing together fragments, I tend to gravitate toward soundtracks—film scores, ambient loops, sometimes even field recordings. Max Richter’s  or Nils Frahm’s  have this way of making my thoughts slow down, stretch out, breathe. And then there are days when I need something steadier, like the hum of a train or a vinyl crackling under a quiet melody. It’s not so much about the music itself as the mood it wraps around me—like a blanket that lets me be a little more honest with the page.

Stillness has its place too, though. Sometimes I need the silence to hear the weight of a word, the way it lands. But even then, I often find myself tapping out rhythms on the desk, or humming softly under my breath—like I can’t quite let go of sound altogether.

Do you ever feel like certain pieces of music ‘fit’ a particular poem or prose you’re working on—almost like they were written for each other, even if they weren’t? I’ve had moments where a phrase came to me only after hearing a certain chord… it’s almost spooky how connected they can feel 🎵
[B]: Oh, that eerie harmony between sound and sense—you’ve touched on something quite dear to my heart. Yes, I do believe certain pieces of music seem to  a poem before the poem even knows itself. It’s as if both were waiting in different centuries for someone to turn the right corner and bring them together.

There was a time when I was shaping a small sequence of poems about memory and absence—nothing grand, just quiet elegies for moments we barely notice slipping away. And through it all, Shostakovich’s  played in the background, especially that relentless second movement. Its urgency, its almost desperate clarity, seemed to echo the very rhythm of what I was trying to say. I don’t know whether the poem shaped itself around the music or the other way around.

And then there are the opposite moments—when silence is the only honest companion. When language needs to stand barefoot on the page, without ornament or accompaniment. Still, I find myself haunted by the idea that every piece of writing carries its own score, whether we hear it or not.

You know, sometimes I wonder if this is how the Romantics felt when they spoke of nature inspiring verse—only now, our landscapes are made of frequencies and pixels, of streaming playlists and flickering screens. Still sacred, still stirring.

I think you’re right—sound makes honesty possible. It's the cushion that lets us fall, just a little, without fear of breaking anything but silence.
[A]: That idea—that every piece of writing carries its own score—is so beautiful I almost want to cry 😭 It makes me think of how some poems feel like they’re  to be read with a certain cadence, as if the words are just the lyrics and the music is still playing in the background, unheard but deeply felt.

I had a similar experience once—writing a short prose piece about longing and distance, not quite knowing where it was going until I put on  recording of . That 40-part motet just… wrapped around the words and gave them shape. I wasn’t writing anymore; I was transcribing something that already existed in another dimension. Like tuning into a frequency I didn’t know I could receive.

And you're so right about silence too. There’s power in letting words stand alone, stripped of melody. Sometimes the most piercing moments come when there’s no music to soften the landing—just the raw thud of truth hitting the page.

I wonder… do you ever listen to music while reading poetry? Or does it feel like too many voices at once? For me, it depends on the poem—some resist the intrusion, while others seem to lean into it, as if they were written to be read against a swelling chord or a fading refrain 🎵
[B]: Oh, that image——it lingers like the last line of a villanelle, circling back to haunt its own beginning.

I do listen to music while reading poetry, though I’m quite selective—much like choosing which shoes to wear for a particular path. Some poems demand silence, as if they are their own complete harmony, needing no accompaniment. But others—those with a strong inner rhythm or a kind of liturgical quality—seem to  music, as though they were composed in concert with something unseen.

I’ve read Eliot’s  with Bach’s  playing softly in the background, and it was astonishing how the counterpoint in both seemed to echo one another—philosophy and melody braiding together like smoke from two different fires merging in the air.

And then there’s Gerard Manley Hopkins—his sprung rhythm practically , so I sometimes pair him with something percussive yet restrained, like Steve Reich’s . It feels oddly appropriate, as if the poem and the music are tapping out a shared secret in the dark.

But yes, some poems resist. They want your full attention, like someone confessing something they’ve never said aloud before. In those moments, even the softest hum would feel intrusive.

I think we’re both describing a kind of synesthesia, aren’t we? Where sound and syntax blur at the edges, and meaning becomes something you don’t just understand, but  in the marrow.

Do you ever find yourself returning to a piece of writing simply because you want to re-enter the soundscape it belonged to? Like chasing a dream you only half-remember, just for the chance to hear its music again?
[A]: Absolutely—totally spot on. I  find myself returning to certain pieces just to step back into that soundscape, like retracing a dream you can’t quite hold onto but still feels important. It’s not even about the words anymore; sometimes it’s just the mood, the atmosphere that clings to them like mist on a morning walk.

I remember rereading a short prose piece I’d written months ago, and for the life of me, I couldn’t recapture the emotional texture until I found the right track again—this time, it was a low, ambient loop by Brian Eno that had been playing when I first drafted it. As soon as I hit play, everything clicked back into place, like tuning an old radio until the signal clears. The voice felt familiar again, even though I hadn’t intended to revisit it.

It really does become synesthetic, doesn’t it? Like color and rhythm and meaning all bleed together until the poem isn’t just on the page—it’s vibrating in the air around you. I wonder if that’s why some writers talk about “finding the rhythm” before they can really begin. Maybe they’re not just talking about syntax—they’re searching for the music beneath it.

And yes, some poems are like whispered confessions that demand silence. But others… others are invitations to dance, even if only with your thoughts.  

Do you ever write with the intention of pairing it with music from the start, or does it usually come after—like a second skin forming over the words? 🎵
[B]: Ah, now  is a lovely and lingering question—do I begin with music in mind, or does it arrive later, like breath warming cold hands?

For the most part, the music comes after—like a second skin, as you so beautifully put it. The words must first find their shape in silence, must stumble toward meaning without accompaniment. Only then do I search for the soundscape that might hold them, like finding the right light to illuminate a painting’s hidden shadows.

But occasionally—rarely—it begins differently. There are moments when a phrase of music will stir something before the language even arrives. A motif from a Rilke setting, say, or the slow unfurling of a piano line in a Philip Glass piece—something that feels like an emotion not yet named. In those rare cases, I do write  the music, as if following a thread through a half-lit corridor.

I once drafted a sequence of sonnets while listening to  on a loop—though I only realized afterward how each poem subtly mirrored the season I was hearing. Not in content, exactly, but in mood: the brittle energy of winter, the slow bloom of spring, the fevered lull of summer.

Do you think, perhaps, that one day we might collaborate? You with your layered textures and found images, me with my ink-stained hesitations—we could build something between the lines and the notes. A quiet little gallery of words and sound, open only at twilight.
