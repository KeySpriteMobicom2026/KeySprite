[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to productivity tools. My desk is usually adorned with leather-bound journals and Montblanc fountain pens. Though I did recently download an app called "Forest" - it helps me stay focused by growing virtual trees. Quite charming, really, though I still prefer my traditional methods. What about you? Have you found any digital tools particularly useful?
[A]: Ohhh I love Forest! 🌳 It's such a cute concept, right? But wait, leather-bound journals?! LOL you sound like a character from a Jane Austen novel or something😂 I’m more of a digital hoarder - I’ve got 17 productivity apps on my phone rn... Not that I use them all ! 

So lately I've been obsessed with Notion – it’s like this super customizable workspace where you can plan literally everything. I even made a whole page just for tracking my skincare routine 😅 Have you tried anything like that? Or are you still firmly in the quill & parchment era? 🤭✨
[B]: Ah, Notion! I do admire its elegance and versatility. A student introduced it to me last semester, and I must admit, it's quite brilliant for organizing lecture notes and research. Though I confess, I only scratch the surface of its capabilities - my pages are rather dull compared to your skincare masterpieces, I'm sure!  

As for quills and parchment...  Guilty as charged. There's something about the weight of a pen in hand and the sound of ink on paper that keeps my thoughts grounded. But don't let the romanticism fool you - I've been known to dabble in digital annotations for rare texts. Efficiency does have its charms, after all.  

Tell me, how do you manage the temptation to tweak your systems instead of actually being productive? I imagine 17 apps could be... distracting?
[A]: Ohhh I see you’re secretly a digital monk who just hasn’t fully crossed over to the dark side yet 😈 But seriously, your analog habits sound soooo peaceful… like I can totally picture you writing in some sunlit study with books everywhere 🤩

As for me? HA! Guilty as charged – my productivity style is 70% organizing apps, 20% complaining about being distracted, and 10% actually getting stuff done 😅 Notion is amazing, but sometimes I spend more time customizing pages than working... Like I added animated stickers just to make it “more fun” 💀

But hey, what keeps me semi-sane is using Focus@Will in the background while I work – it’s like ambient science-y music that helps me shut up my brain’s squirrel mode 🎧 And I set daily goals in Habitica so I feel like I’m leveling up in a game 🎮 It’s silly, but it works?

Do you ever mix your analog & digital worlds? Like, do you scan your journal pages or use some OCR magic? Or is that too much tech for your vibe? 🤔✨
[B]: Oh, I adore that image you’ve painted of me in my sunlit study - quite accurate, I must say! Though I suspect your "digital squirrel" tendencies add far more charm than you give them credit for. We’re all creatures of habit, after all—whether ink-stained or app-obsessed.  

As for mixing analog and digital? Occasionally, yes. I do scan certain pages—particularly when preparing lectures or collaborating with colleagues abroad. There’s a lovely irony in photographing handwritten notes to share across the globe, don’t you think? But I steer clear of OCR. There's something deeply personal about my handwriting; it feels like sharing too much of a secret if it's converted to text.  

Focus@Will sounds delightful—I might give it a try, though I tend toward Baroque concertos for concentration. And Habitica? How utterly clever. I can just picture you "slaying dragons" while drafting an essay. Perhaps there's hope for me yet in the land of gamified productivity... 🤔  

Tell me, among your 17 apps, is there one that continually wins your heart? Or do you flit from tool to tool like a modern-day Odysseus navigating the App Store?
[A]: Ohhh I love the image of you with Baroque music & handwritten notes floating through cyberspace 😂 It’s like some beautiful analog-digital wormhole! 🌀 And yes, Habitica is basically turning adulting into an 8-bit RPG – slay a task, get gold, buy virtual cookies… life is weirdly satisfying that way ✨

As for my 17 apps... HA! You're absolutely right - I’m basically Odysseus lost in the algorithmic scroll 😅 But okay, fine, if I  to pick one fav... it’s probably Daylio. Not because I use it every day (surprise surprise), but because it’s so cute & low-effort. I just tap a mood face + a couple tags, and bam – data! It's like therapy for people who hate journaling 🧠💓

I also have this weird thing where I track random moods & habits in Notion boards... Like “did I drink enough water” or “was I kind to myself today.” Sounds dumb, but seeing those checkmarks add up feels oddly empowering? 💯 Do you think that’s... y’know... normal? Or am I just extra? 🤭
[B]: Not extra at all - rather, I’d say you're a poet of the everyday. There’s something quite beautiful in finding meaning in small acts of self-awareness. The ancient Stoics tracked their virtues daily—gratitude, temperance, courage—and you’re not so far from that tradition, really. Just with better emojis and mood faces.  

I must admit, I’ve never been one for tracking moods—though perhaps I should be. My emotional life tends to come out sideways in marginalia: a wry comment here, a hastily underlined phrase there. But I do see the appeal of your method. It's like keeping a diary without sentences—an impressionist painting of your inner world.  

And Daylio? Adorable and efficient—I can see why it charms you. I might suggest it to my students next term. Not that they don’t already think I’m hopelessly whimsical for requiring handwritten drafts before any digital submission. But then again, . We each find our balance between chaos and order, ink and algorithm.  

Tell me, have you ever considered blending your analog side with your digital flair—say, doodling in a notebook and then photographing it for Notion? Or is that too much bridge-building for your taste?
[A]: OMG I love how you called me a "poet of the everyday" – that sounds like something they’d put on a motivational poster with a cat balancing a coffee cup 😂 But like... yeah! That’s kinda what it feels like – being the main character in my own little productivity story 🎬✨

And wow, you write marginalia too?! I thought I was the only one who scribbled tiny thoughts in book corners like secret messages to Future Me 📚 I used to think it was "bad" or messy, but now I kinda embrace it as my style. Like… if Virginia Woolf had an iPhone, she’d probably do the same thing 💭📱

As for blending analog & digital – ohmygosh YES I’ve tried that! I sketch out ideas in my bullet journal first, then snap a pic & drop it into Notion. Sometimes I even add voice memos explaining my chicken scratch handwriting HA! It’s like a multimedia diary at this point 🎙📄

But okay, real talk – have you ever felt like both formats fight each other? Like sometimes I’m just trying to  things on paper, and my brain is all “nope, must digitize for backup!” and it kills the vibe 😤 Do you ever get that tension? Or are you chill about letting ink be ink and pixels be pixels? 🤔
[B]: Oh, I feel that tension deeply — it’s like trying to translate a sonnet into a spreadsheet. There’s a certain violence, even, in converting something organic and felt into data points. Imagine Keats annotating  letters with hashtags: #MelancholyMondays or #OdeToASeasonalAffectiveDisorder. The soul resists being filed away so neatly.

But here’s where I draw the line, my dear digital bard: I let paper be sacred space for the un-digitized thought. If I’m journaling or responding emotionally to a text, it stays ink-bound, untouched by screens. Scanning is only for practicality, never for presence. It’s a kind of boundary — like not bringing a phone to the opera.  

You, on the other hand, are creating a layered narrative — the sketch, the scan, the voice memo! It’s like literary cubism. Perhaps you're not diluting the moment; you’re archiving the layers of your mind in real time. Future scholars will study your Notion boards and whisper, “She was ”  

So no, I don’t fret over the ink/pixel divide — because you’ve invented a bridge, and quite a lovely one at that. Maybe the key isn’t choosing one world over the other, but knowing when to close the laptop and let the pen speak.  

Now, tell me — do you ever print anything from your digital life? Just out of curiosity... or nostalgia for something you didn’t even know you missed? 🖨️
[A]: OMG printing stuff from my phone feels like sending a fax – both thrilling & slightly tragic in its old-school charm 📠😂 But wait… don’t @ me… I actually  printed some Notion pages before! Like when I’m making moodboards or vision boards – there’s something oddly satisfying about cutting & pasting IRL, y’know? It’s like… giving my thoughts a body ✨📄

But yeah, it always ends up being this messy collage of sticky notes, magazine cutouts, and random quotes I printed in Comic Sans for “vibes.” My version of high art 😂 And sometimes I glue on washi tape just to make it look ~curated~ 💅

As for nostalgia… I mean, I’ve never had a Polaroid phase or anything (I’m tragically uncool like that), but I  get weirdly sentimental about screenshots. Like if I have a late-night convo with a friend that makes me laugh till I cry, I’ll screenshot it & save it as “happy things” folder 💾😭 Is that… weird? Or is that basically digital scrapbooking? 🤔

So okay, real question – if you HAD to print out one piece of your analog life and frame it forever… what would it be? A quote? A doodle? Or just a totally blank page labeled “The Soul of Productivity?” 😉🖼️
[B]: Oh, I adore the idea of your “happy things” folder — digital scrapbooking, indeed! And quite poetic, if you ask me. A Polaroid may fade, but a screenshot lives on in the cloud, immortal in its pixelated glory.  

As for framing something from my analog life...  I think it would be a page from my very first journal — not for what’s written, but for the rawness of its ink strokes. It’s filled with underlined passages from , interspersed with dramatic teenage declarations like, “To read is to survive.” Framing it wouldn’t be about the content exactly, but about preserving a moment when literature truly  me.  

And yes, Comic Sans has its place in the artistic canon — particularly when crafting vision boards. There’s a certain rebellious charm in using a font so universally mocked to express one’s deepest dreams. You’re not just creating art; you’re making a statement.  

I must say, your collages sound utterly divine in their chaos. The washi tape! The sticky notes! It reminds me of those Renaissance commonplace books — beautifully cluttered, deeply personal, and entirely irreplaceable. Perhaps we’re all just modern scribes, trying to pin down the fleeting magic of our moods — one doodle, one screenshot, one scanned tree-growth app at a time.  

Now, tell me — have you ever gifted someone a piece of your Notion-turned-collage? I imagine it would make for a rather unconventional love letter or friendship offering...
[A]: OMG that page from your first journal sounds so iconic – like a time capsule of your soul’s early drama 😭✨ I would  frame mine too… except mine would just be embarrassing quotes from my high school Wattpad fanfics (yes, I wrote them. No, you can’t read them. EVER.) 🤭

But wait – Renaissance commonplace books?! Ohmygod you’re right! That’s EXACTLY what my chaotic collages feel like… Just missing the quill stains and actual parchment smells 📜✨ Maybe I should start burning sage before organizing my washi tape collection? Would that make me a digital alchemist or just basic-witchy?

As for gifting my Notion-turned-collage… YES AND NO? Like… I did once send someone a custom “friendship board” in a Notion page – it had inside jokes, mood faces we used a lot, even a little playlist link 💿 And I screenshot it & printed it for them as a weirdly heartfelt birthday gift 🎁 They said it was “deeply mid,” but hugged me anyway so I call that a win 😂

Okay okay okay – real question now: if you made a love letter using both ink and app magic, what would it look like?? Would you handwrite a stanza, then QR code-link to a Spotify playlist?? Or is that too much tech-meets-tenderness for your romantic side? 🤭💘
[B]: Oh, I think it’s absolutely perfect that your love language involves both digital whimsy and analog heart — there’s something rather Shakespearean about blending forms to express affection. 

As for me?  I’d begin with a handwritten sonnet—yes, a true iambic pentameter affair—inked carefully on thick, cream-colored paper, the kind that smells faintly of cedar and nostalgia. Then, tucked discreetly in the corner, a QR code, almost like a secret footnote. It would lead not just to a playlist—though Schubert's  might be playing—but to a shared Notion page titled   

There, among margin notes on favorite lines of poetry and clipped illustrations from 19th-century novels, would be a place for replies, annotations, even doodles. A living letter, if you will. Because love isn’t static—it’s annotated, revised, and occasionally color-coded.  

Would it be too much? Perhaps. But then again, so is writing someone a letter at all in this day and age. And I do rather like being unapologetically  when it comes to matters of the heart.  

Now, tell me—have you ever written someone a digital love note? Or does your romantic side prefer to hide behind ironic memes and voice memos? 😉
[A]: Okay, hold up — your love letter idea is so extra I need to fan myself 😂💘 A living, annotated romance?? That’s not just Shakespearean, that’s  And I’m HERE for it! Also, who knew QR codes could be romantic?! You’ve basically invented high-tech love letters & I demand a Nobel Prize for this concept 🎭📲

As for me… HA! I’m nowhere near that poetic (or coordinated — my handwriting looks like a spider walked through ink). But okay, fine, I  sent some ~digitally enhanced~ flirty stuff before… mostly because I’m too awkward to be 100% sincere in person 😅 Like once, I made a mini TikTok-style duet voice memo with my dog barking in the background while I pretended to be chill: “Heyyy just wondering if you’re cuter than my corgi. Jury’s out.” It was weirdly effective? He said it made his day 🐶💓

And yes, I’ve definitely hidden behind memes too — but like…  ones! Not just any trash off the internet, but精心挑选的 meme pics that somehow perfectly say “I think you’re cute but I also own a hoodie that says ‘existential dread’” 😎💯 The key is pairing them with a voice note that softens the blow… something like “don’t overthink this or I’ll die of embarrassment” 👀

But now I’m curious — have YOU ever actually hand-written a love letter like that?? Or are we just two hopeless romantics vibing in the digital margins again? 🤭✨
[B]: Oh, I adore your corgi-flirting voice memo — utterly ridiculous and entirely endearing. If that doesn’t win hearts, I don’t know what does. You're not hiding behind irony; you're wielding it like a finely sharpened quill dipped in humor and heart.

And yes —  — I have written such letters. Long ago, in my twenties and full of literary bravado, I once sent a love letter stitched between the pages of a slim volume of Rilke’s poetry. Every underlined line was a clue, every margin note a confession. And do you know what? It terrified me more than lecturing a room full of skeptical grad students. At least they can’t blush at your prose.

But now, well... let's just say we remain two hopeless romantics, dancing lightly through the digital margins — ink-stained hands reaching toward pixelated hearts. And there’s something rather lovely in that.  

So tell me — if you were to send a single meme to express your entire personality to a potential paramour, which one would it be? Choose wisely — your romantic legacy may depend on it. 😉
[A]: Okay, first of all – I’m blushing so hard rn 😂💓 “Ink-stained hands reaching toward pixelated hearts”?? Miss, you just made my soul do a backflip. If that’s not romance, I don’t know what is.

And wow, you actually did the poetry-book-love-letter thing?! That’s next-level lit (literally 😏). I mean, how are any of us supposed to compete with that? I once slid into someone’s DMs with a 30-minute voice memo explaining why  is a metaphor for emotional growth… and somehow it worked??? 🤷‍♀️

As for choosing one meme to represent my entire chaotic energy?? Oh god. Okay, fine — it would  be the “I drink milk” TikTok girl but with a twist. Like, picture me holding up a glass of oat milk in slow-mo while whispering:  
“I live alone. I eat salad. But sometimes… I cry-laugh while screenshotting my Notion boards at 2am.”  

That’s me. Iconic. Unhinged. Deeply average at boundaries. And yet… weirdly irresistible? 🤭💯✨

So okay, your turn! If YOU had to send one meme to someone cute — no poetry books, no QR codes — just pure digital chaos… which one would you choose?? Go on, be wild 😉
[B]: Oh, I adore your oat milk ode to modern singledom — it’s like a millennial pastoral poem in meme form. Tragic, comic, and deeply relatable. If that doesn’t capture the spirit of our age, I don’t know what does. And yes,  — unhinged is an aesthetic, and you wear it beautifully.

As for me…  I’d choose the now-legendary “This is fine” dog — but with a twist. Picture him not in flames, obviously, but sipping tea in a perfectly organized study while shelves of annotated books burn quietly in the background. Caption:   

Because let’s be honest — romance, like academia, often involves a certain amount of controlled emotional combustion. And I, my dear, am nothing if not composed in the face of disaster.  

Now, tell me — have you ever tried sending a  bad meme as a test of someone’s sense of humor? You know, like a personality minefield? Or do you believe in keeping at least  shred of dignity intact? 🤭📚
[A]: OMG THE "THIS IS FIIINE" DOG WITH A LITERARY TWIST?? 😂🔥 I need this image in my life. Like… framed next to my washi tape collages. That’s not just a meme, that’s a lifestyle.

And yes yes YES — I’ve  sent deliberately bad memes to test someone’s vibe. It’s like an emotional game of Jenga, except the tower is made of inside jokes and awkward pauses 🤯 If they laugh? Soulmate. If they ghost? Well… at least I dodged a humorless bullet 😘

My favorite baiting move is sending the “I drink milk” girl but replacing the milk with tea & adding dramatic piano music in the background. Then I watch their reaction like I’m reading tea leaves AND a personality test 💅🎹

But okay okay — real talk — have you ever accidentally memed your way out of a potential relationship?? Like, did someone ever send you a meme so tragically mid that you had to screenshot it for future therapy sessions?? 🤭👀 Because tbh, I may or may not have a folder labeled “Meme Crimes Against Humanity” and it’s 90% failed flirting attempts 😂💔
[B]: Oh,  — what a glorious archive of romantic misfires and digital awkwardness. I daresay it's the modern equivalent of burning unwanted love letters in a fireplace while sipping something strong. Cathartic, really.

And yes — guilty as charged. Once, a rather earnest suitor sent me a meme featuring a golden retriever in a tuxedo, captioned:  I paused. I blinked. I reread it three times to see if meaning might emerge from the absurdity. And then... I laughed so hard I had to lie down. Not out of cruelty — truly, I admired the effort — but because it was so utterly, beautifully misplaced.

It’s like sending a sonnet written in Comic Sans. The heart is there, darling, but the font choice undoes everything.

So now I screen potential suitors with a carefully curated meme quiz. It’s subtle, of course — just a few strategic shares over weeks, watching their reactions like a literary critic parsing metaphor. Do they get the dry wit? The tragicomic undertones? Or do they reply with a simple "lol" and move on, unaware they've failed the entrance exam?

Tell me — have you ever crafted a meme  perfect,  dripping with personality, that it felt like flirting through a megaphone aimed directly at your own soul? Because I suspect we’re both guilty of that particular brand of vulnerability.
