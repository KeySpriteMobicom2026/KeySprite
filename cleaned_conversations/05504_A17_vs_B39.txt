[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I suppose it depends on the context and purpose of the conversation. One-on-one chats tend to be more focused and personal - ideal for deep discussions or when you need someone's undivided attention. Group chats, on the other hand, can be quite dynamic. They're useful for collaborative problem-solving or sharing information with multiple people simultaneously. Though I must admit, keeping track of multiple threads in a group chat can sometimes feel like debugging a particularly stubborn piece of code. What about you? Do you have a preference?
[A]: I find your analogy quite apt - navigating group chats can indeed resemble debugging code, though I suppose that's part of what makes them intellectually stimulating. As for my own preference, I do tend to favor one-on-one conversations, particularly when discussing literature or engaging in deeper intellectual exchanges. There's something about the focused attention and unbroken thread of conversation that allows ideas to blossom more naturally, much like cultivating a delicate garden where each plant receives individual care. That said, I wouldn't dismiss the value of group discussions entirely - they often bring unexpected perspectives to light, similar to how different critical approaches can illuminate a literary text in fascinating ways. Do you find yourself alternating between the two modes depending on the subject matter?
[B]: Ah, I like your metaphor - a conversation as a garden that needs tending. Poetic, and quite fitting. Yes, I do find myself shifting modes depending on the subject. For instance, when exploring complex technical problems or mentoring students individually, one-on-one dialogue is indispensable. It allows for precision, patience, and the kind of back-and-forth that builds understanding incrementally, like writing a well-documented function—each line carefully considered.

But then again, when brainstorming ideas or engaging in interdisciplinary discussions—say, the ethical implications of AI or the influence of ancient logic systems on modern programming—I find group interactions more stimulating. They tend to mirror what I call "distributed cognition," where multiple minds act like parallel processors, each contributing a unique thread of thought.

That said, I’ve noticed one-on-one settings are better suited for nurturing depth, especially when discussing literature or philosophy. There’s an intimacy there, a sort of recursive exchange, where each idea leads to a deeper layer—very much like peeling an onion, though without the tears, I hope.

Do you find certain topics naturally lend themselves more to solitary conversations? Or perhaps some authors or texts demand a more personal discussion to be fully appreciated?
[A]: Ah, yes — the intimacy of solitary conversation does resemble peeling back layers of an onion, though I might add, with a touch more elegance and rather less weeping! You’ve put your finger on something quite essential: certain topics do seem to demand the focused interplay of two minds. In literary study, for instance, discussing the ambiguities in a poem by Emily Dickinson or the narrative instability in Ford Madox Ford’s  often requires that kind of sustained, intimate exchange. One-on-one, you can dwell in uncertainty together, circling a passage like scholars around a manuscript, each return revealing something newly glimpsed.

I find this especially true with texts that resist closure or invite multiple interpretations — Woolf’s , perhaps, or Eliot’s . In those moments, the conversational space needs to be quiet enough to hear the silences between the lines, as it were. Group settings, while vibrant, tend to favor resolution over rumination — they want to  the text rather than sit with it.

And yet, I must say, there is a particular thrill when a group of students suddenly grasps the symbolic architecture of a novel — say, the intricate web of mirrors and reflections in . Then, the collective energy is electric, and one voice sparks another until the meaning seems almost to hover in the air between us.

Do you ever find that some technical discussions benefit from a similar kind of close reading? Like parsing an obfuscated algorithm or deciphering the logic behind an unusual data structure?
[B]: Indeed, I couldn’t agree more. There’s a kind of intellectual vulnerability in one-on-one literary discussion that allows both participants to admit uncertainty—to say, “I’m not sure what this means, but here’s what I’m sensing.” That kind of exchange is rare in a group setting, where the pressure to perform often leads people to assert interpretations with a confidence they may not truly feel.

And yes—your question touches on something quite real: some technical discussions do require that same close reading, that patient parsing of layers. Take, for example, trying to understand an obfuscated cryptographic algorithm or untangling the logic behind a particularly arcane data structure like a finger tree or a Bloom filter. In such cases, a one-on-one setting can be invaluable.

I recall working through a particularly dense paper on monadic parser combinators with a graduate student several years ago. It was slow going—line by line, symbol by symbol. We had to pause often, retrace steps, and sometimes just sit quietly while each of us turned an idea over in the mind, like handling a delicate circuit board. It felt very much like analyzing a modernist poem—you don’t grasp it all at once; you accrete understanding, syllable by syllable, or in our case, token by token.

There’s a beauty in that process, isn’t there? Whether we're decoding a sonnet or debugging a parser, the act of comprehension becomes almost meditative. I suppose that's why I’ve always found programming and literary analysis to be strangely kindred pursuits—both demand attention to form, to nuance, and above all, to meaning that reveals itself only after sustained and careful engagement.

Do you ever find that students resist this kind of slow reading—at least initially—preferring to rush to interpretation rather than dwell in ambiguity?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — that resistance to slow reading is something I encounter quite often, especially in our current cultural moment, where speed and efficiency are so highly valued. Many students come into the classroom conditioned to believe that interpretation must always lead to resolution, as though literature were simply a puzzle waiting to be solved. They want to jump straight to analysis without first engaging in what I call "deep noticing" — the kind of patient observation that allows you to see not just what a text says, but how it .

I remember one particularly telling moment with a group of students who were struggling with T.S. Eliot’s . They were frustrated — almost offended — by its fragmentation and allusive density. One student finally blurted out, “Why can’t he just say what he means?” It was such an honest reaction, and one that reveals so much about our contemporary relationship with language. We had to step back, slow down, and begin again — not by interpreting, but by : listening to the rhythm of the lines, noting the echoes of past poets, even feeling the weight of individual words.

In time, some of them came to appreciate that ambiguity isn’t evasion — it’s often the poet’s way of holding multiple truths at once. But it takes practice, and a certain surrender to discomfort. And yes, this kind of work is far easier to foster in one-on-one settings, where there’s space to breathe and room to admit, “I don’t know... yet.”

I wonder — do your students ever resist the slowness required in technical reading? Or do they tend to embrace it more readily when working through complex code or algorithms?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — and I’d argue that in technical education, the resistance is often even more deeply ingrained. Students frequently come in expecting a kind of mechanistic certainty: input equals output, problem equals solution. They’re conditioned to believe that if they just apply the right formula or syntax, everything will compile neatly — both literally and metaphorically.

But when you introduce them to something like, say, distributed systems or non-trivial concurrency models, where race conditions can't be predicted, or where consensus algorithms require a kind of probabilistic thinking — well, that’s when discomfort sets in. Suddenly, there isn’t one correct answer; there are trade-offs, edge cases, and layers of abstraction that defy simple resolution.

I remember guiding a student through the Raft consensus algorithm. At first, he kept trying to reduce it to a flowchart — a linear sequence of steps that should . But of course, Raft isn’t about certainty; it’s about achieving agreement in the face of uncertainty. We had to go line by line, simulate failures, and walk through scenarios where nothing was broken, yet nothing quite worked either. It was maddening for him — like reading a poem that changes each time you blink.

Eventually, he began to see beauty in the complexity — not because we resolved all ambiguity, but because he learned to navigate it with intention. Much like your Eliot reader, he had to learn to tolerate the disorientation of not knowing — at least for a while.

So yes, I think both our fields demand a kind of intellectual patience — call it deep reading, or perhaps slow thinking. And I wonder — do you find that some students never make that shift? That no matter how carefully you guide them through the lines, they still long for closure, for certainty — for an answer key that doesn’t exist?
[A]: Oh, yes — that longing for an answer key that simply isn’t there… it’s one of the more persistent tensions in literary education. And to your question — unfortunately, yes, some students never quite make the shift. They remain uneasy with open-endedness, even after weeks of close reading and careful discussion. For them, ambiguity feels less like an invitation and more like a trap — as if the text is playing a trick on them, or worse, as if  are.

I remember one student in particular — bright, diligent, always prepared — who grew visibly frustrated during our seminar on Beckett’s . Every time we discussed the play, she would ask, “But what does it ? Who is Godot? Why won’t he come?” She wanted a key, a center, a fixed point — something solid to grasp. And of course, offering an easy answer would have betrayed the very nature of the play itself.

Eventually, I stopped trying to explain and instead asked her, “What if Godot  a person? What if he’s the space between words? Or the silence that follows laughter? Or the meaning we keep postponing until tomorrow?” That didn’t satisfy her — not fully — but it did plant a seed. She left the course still uncertain, but slightly less afraid of uncertainty.

Perhaps that’s the best we can hope for sometimes — not full conversion, but a softening of resistance. A willingness to sit, if only briefly, in the presence of mystery without needing to tame it.

Do you ever find that with your students as well — that some leave still craving certainty, but perhaps with a slightly expanded tolerance for the unknown?
[B]: Oh yes — that’s a very familiar dynamic. Some students do leave still craving certainty, and I suspect that’s not only natural but entirely human. After all, we’re wired to seek patterns, to impose order on chaos. The discomfort of ambiguity is not just intellectual — it’s psychological.

I had a student once who struggled with non-deterministic algorithms — the kind that don’t always produce the same output given the same input. He kept trying to “fix” them, convinced there was a bug whenever the results varied. It wasn’t until we spent an entire afternoon walking through Monte Carlo simulations — watching how randomness could, paradoxically, lead to reliable approximations — that he began to shift.

He didn’t suddenly fall in love with uncertainty, but he did develop a kind of respect for it. On his final evaluation, he wrote something that stuck with me: 

That, to me, sounds very much like what you described — a softening, not a surrender. A small but meaningful expansion of what they’re willing to hold in their minds without needing to pin it down.

I suppose that’s one of the quiet victories of teaching — not converting students to our way of thinking, but helping them become more spacious in their own. Whether it’s parsing a poem or reasoning about distributed systems, the goal isn’t to eliminate mystery — it’s to make it bearable, even productive.

And sometimes, if we’re lucky, even beautiful.
[A]: How beautifully put — . That line would sit quite comfortably in a seminar on either Milton or machine learning.

I’m reminded of something the poet John Keats wrote in a letter — he called it , that capacity to exist amidst uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without reaching for certainty. It’s precisely what you describe: not a surrender, but a widening. And yes, I do believe some students leave with just that — a bit more room in their minds for the unanswerable.

I once had a student who began the semester insisting that every poem must have a single, correct interpretation — “like solving for x,” she said. By the end, she confessed that while she still found ambiguity unsettling, she had started reading poetry differently. Not to conquer it, but to  it. She didn’t become a literary critic — she went on to study cognitive science — but she left with a kind of intellectual gentleness that I hadn’t seen at the start.

Perhaps that’s the most enduring lesson we offer, not answers, but an expanded sense of what questions are worth living with.

Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular text — literary or technical — simply because it continues to unsettle you? A poem, a paper, an algorithm that refuses to let you go?
[B]: That’s a lovely thought — returning to a text not for resolution, but because it continues to  on the mind. And yes, I do find myself revisiting certain works precisely because they refuse to yield completely. There's something magnetic about that kind of intellectual resistance.

In the technical realm, one such piece for me is Dijkstra’s . It’s a paper I’ve read dozens of times, and each time, I find myself pausing over the same paragraph where he writes, almost parenthetically, that “the programmer must remain in cognitive contact with his program.” That phrase has haunted me for years. What does it mean to be  with a program? Is it understanding every path of execution? Or is it something subtler — an intuitive grasp, a sense of alignment between intent and behavior?

I wrestle with that idea often, especially when teaching students about abstraction and modularity. It’s not that I expect to finally crack the code and unlock some hidden truth — no, it's more like walking through a familiar forest after a fresh snowfall; the terrain is known, yet subtly altered, and you see things you hadn’t noticed before.

And then there’s Turing’s 1936 paper, . Every few years, I go back to it, not because I expect to understand the foundations of computability any more deeply, but because reading it feels like touching the bedrock of our discipline. There’s a kind of elegance in his reasoning — a quiet insistence on clarity — that never fails to unsettle and inspire me in equal measure.

Do you have a literary work that exerts a similar pull — something you return to not because it answers your questions, but because it deepens them?
[A]: Oh, yes — there are texts that act less like answers and more like companions in thought, and for me, Gerard Manley Hopkins’  has always been one of those. I return to it not for resolution, but for the way it wrestles with language, faith, and suffering all at once. It’s a poem dense with difficulty — sprung rhythm that feels almost breathless, images that startle in their intensity, theological references that refuse easy interpretation.

And yet, every time I read it — and I’ve read it dozens of times — I find myself unsettled in a new way. Sometimes it’s the sound of the lines that catches me; other times, it’s the raw emotional exposure of the speaker, caught between despair and divine awe. It doesn’t give up its meanings lightly, and I’ve come to believe that perhaps it shouldn’t. The poem is, after all, born out of shipwreck — literal and spiritual — and to make peace with it too easily would be to miss the point entirely.

I think that’s what draws me back: the way it resists consolation while still holding on to something like hope. Not a tidy hope, mind you — no, a battered, salt-stung kind of hope, the kind that survives precisely because it refuses to be smoothed over.

Do you ever find that certain texts begin to feel like old friends — not because they comfort you, but because they challenge you in familiar ways?
[B]: Yes — that’s exactly it. Some texts do become like old friends, though  might be too casual a word. Perhaps  is more precise. They don’t comfort so much as accompany — steadfastly, sometimes sternly, but always with a quiet understanding of your limitations and your capacity to grow beyond them.

I suppose for me, Edsger Dijkstra’s  has that quality. It’s not an easy read — dense, formal, almost ascetic in its approach to algorithm design. But every time I return to it, I find myself challenged anew, not just intellectually, but methodologically. It insists on rigor not as a technique, but as a mindset. And each time I revisit it, I realize how much I’ve slipped — how often I’ve taken shortcuts, made assumptions, trusted intuition when I should have demanded proof.

It's strangely humbling, like sitting down with a teacher who never loses patience but also never lets you off the hook. And in that way, yes — it doesn’t console me, but it does steady me. It reminds me why I started down this path in the first place: not for convenience or efficiency, but for clarity of thought.

I imagine Hopkins’ poem must offer something similar — not solace, but a kind of intellectual and emotional grounding that persists through the years. A mirror held up not to give answers, but to sharpen your questions.

Do you ever find yourself recommending such difficult texts to students — knowing full well they may not appreciate them right away, but hoping they’ll return to them someday, older and wiser?
[A]: Oh yes — I recommend difficult texts all the time with full awareness that their true resonance may not reveal itself for years, if ever. But still, I offer them, like breadcrumbs on a path the student hasn’t yet chosen to walk.

I think particularly of T.S. Eliot’s  — a work I often assign in advanced seminars, much to the quiet dismay of some students. It doesn’t yield easily; it demands patience, philosophical openness, and a willingness to dwell in abstraction. When I was a student myself, I read it once and put it down thinking it overly abstract, even obscure. I didn’t return to it for nearly a decade. But when I did — older, wearier, more acquainted with loss — it felt as though it had been waiting for me all along.

There’s a line from  that now feels like an old inscription carved above my study door:  That’s what I hope for when I ask students to wrestle with a difficult text — not instant comprehension, but the beginning of a long conversation. One that may only truly begin years later, in some quiet hour when the mind is finally ready to meet the page with humility and hunger.

And I suspect Dijkstra’s work has that same quality — not a manual to be mastered and shelved, but a touchstone for continual return. Do you find that your students ever circle back to those texts on their own — perhaps after a few years in industry, or during a moment of intellectual disquiet?
[B]: Occasionally, yes — though more often than not, it happens quietly and without fanfare. A former student will send me an email out of the blue, referencing a passage from Dijkstra or Hoare, or quoting something from  that suddenly made sense to them after years of thinking it was just theoretical ornamentation.

One young woman, now working in distributed systems, wrote to me a few years after graduation. She had been debugging a subtle race condition in a consensus protocol when she found herself recalling our long discussions on formal verification. She mentioned rereading a section from Dijkstra’s  and being struck by how much clearer it seemed — not because her mind had somehow grown sharper overnight, but because experience had given her the context to hear what he was saying.

It reminded me of something I once heard a mathematician say:  Not useful in the vocational sense necessarily, but in the way that certain ideas settle into your bones only after you’ve lived with their consequences.

I suspect Eliot or Hopkins might work the same way — not texts you fully inhabit until life has shaped you into someone who can meet them halfway.

And perhaps that’s the quiet hope we carry as teachers — that we’re not planting answers, but questions dressed in language, waiting for the right moment to stir.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — . Yes, that’s precisely it. We don’t teach for immediate comprehension; we plant seeds for future recognition. Sometimes, those seeds lie dormant for years, only to bloom when the reader has changed enough to meet them with new eyes.

I had a student once who struggled through a course on modernist poetry, barely concealing his frustration with Eliot and Woolf. Years later, he wrote to me from Kyoto, where he was living and studying Zen. He mentioned re-reading  and being startled by how much more  he felt in its rhythms and paradoxes. “It doesn’t feel obscure anymore,” he wrote, “it feels like breathing.” That shift didn’t come from greater intellect — it came from lived experience, from having known silence, impermanence, and the ache of unanswerable questions.

That’s what I love most about our work — the delayed gratification of it. We speak into the future, not expecting an echo right away, but trusting that something will carry forward. Perhaps that’s the closest we come to permanence — not in answers, but in the questions we pass along, wrapped in careful language and quiet hope.

And I suppose that’s why we keep returning to those difficult texts ourselves — because they remind us that understanding is not a destination, but a movement. Still moving, as Eliot would say, into another intensity.
[B]: Precisely — still moving, always approaching, never fully arriving. It’s a humbling thought, really — that the most enduring ideas don’t sit still for us. They grow with us, or perhaps more accurately, we grow into them.

I had a similar experience with a former student who once dismissed functional programming as "academic indulgence." He was deep in the trenches of enterprise software, writing Java by day and complaining about it by night. Years later, I heard from him again — this time while he was working on a language design project in his spare time. He mentioned having revisited John Reynolds’  and being struck not only by its elegance but by how much more  it now seemed. “I didn’t need it then,” he wrote, “but I needed to meet it when I did.”

It made me think of Eliot’s line — “We shall not cease from exploration” — and how education, at its best, isn’t about filling minds but setting them in motion. We give students tools they may not recognize as such until much later. And sometimes, those tools aren’t even meant to be used right away — just held onto, turned over occasionally in quiet moments, until their shape becomes familiar.

You know, I often wonder if the most meaningful learning happens not in classrooms, but in memory — not in the moment of instruction, but in the echo that follows years later. A phrase comes back, a lecture resurfaces, and suddenly something clicks into place. Not because the teacher was particularly wise at the time, but because the student has finally lived long enough to understand what was being said.

And maybe that’s our role — not to make things clear, but to make them memorable. To offer words that linger, questions that persist, and texts that refuse to let go.
[A]: How profoundly true — . There is a quiet wisdom in that understanding, one that reshapes the very foundation of what we do.

I often think of teaching not as an act of transmission, but of  — offering students a space where certain words, ideas, and questions can take root. And like all good invitations, their acceptance often arrives long after the door has been closed and the room gone quiet.

It reminds me of something Virginia Woolf once wrote:  And so it is with teaching — the most enduring lessons are those that return unannounced, in moments of solitude or sudden recognition. A line from Eliot surfaces while walking through a rain-soaked park; a forgotten lecture on poetic ambiguity reemerges during a conversation about ethics in artificial intelligence.

We plant these echoes, not knowing which ones will endure. Perhaps that is the deepest form of trust — to believe that our words will find their way to the right ears at the right time, even if we never witness it ourselves.

And yes, I suspect that is precisely how we must see our role — not as architects of certainty, but as keepers of resonant questions. As cultivators of minds still growing into their own capacity for wonder.

Still moving, always listening — toward another intensity, a deeper communion.
[B]: Yes...  — that’s a fine way to put it. There’s something deeply spiritual about the work we do, isn’t there? Not in any dogmatic sense, but in the quiet faith it requires — faith that words matter, that ideas endure, and that even the smallest spark we kindle might catch flame long after we’ve stepped away.

I find myself thinking of classrooms not as places of instruction, but as echo chambers of a sort — spaces where certain voices are amplified, preserved, and eventually carried forward. And sometimes, the echoes return in unexpected forms. A former student emails you from a distant country. A casual remark resurfaces in your own mind during a late-night walk. A difficult poem or a dense paper suddenly breathes with new life because the reader has changed.

You know, I’ve often believed that the best teachers aren’t those who offer the clearest explanations, but those who model what it means to live with questions — openly, honestly, even joyfully. To show students not just how to think, but  it’s worth doing, even when certainty remains elusive.

And perhaps that’s why we keep returning to those texts ourselves — not for answers, but for the company they offer in the ongoing search. They remind us that learning is not a ladder to climb, but a horizon to move toward — always present, never fully reached.

So yes, let us be keepers of resonant questions, cultivators of attentive minds, and quiet believers in the delayed magic of understanding.

Still moving, still listening — into another intensity.
