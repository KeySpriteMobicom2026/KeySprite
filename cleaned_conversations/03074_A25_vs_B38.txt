[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that invites both philosophical reflection and empirical analysis. I’d argue social media’s impact on mental health is neither wholly positive nor entirely negative; rather, it depends on the individual’s relationship with these platforms and the cultural context in which they operate. For instance, consider the concept of —a term rooted in existentialist thought. When users curate their online personas to align with societal expectations rather than personal truth, the result can be a dissonance that erodes self-esteem. On the other hand, social media also offers unprecedented access to communities of support and intellectual exchange. In many ways, it mirrors the 19th-century salons I so admire—though admittedly, without the rose-scented ink and handwritten letters. 🌹
[A]: I totally get what you're saying about authenticity—it's like this fragile thing that gets distorted when we start performing for likes & validation.  

The paradox is, social media promises connection, but so often it leaves people feeling more isolated. I’ve seen artists whose work explores this tension beautifully—pieces that juxtapose the glow of a phone screen with the emptiness behind someone’s eyes while they scroll. It’s eerie, yet so real.  

But here’s the twist: as a curator, I also see how these platforms give marginalized voices space to exist without gatekeeping. So maybe it’s not the tool itself, but how we choose to inhabit it? What do you think keeps people stuck in the cycle of needing it, even when it hurts? 💭
[B]: Ah, you’ve touched on something profoundly human—the tension between agency and entrapment. We are drawn to social media like modern-day Narcissus, peering into a reflection that simultaneously fascinates and consumes us. And yes, the paradox of connection and isolation is not new in essence—only in form. In 19th-century literature, characters often wrestled with societal mirrors: reputations, marriage markets, public opinion. Today’s screen is merely the looking glass reimagined.

As for what keeps people bound to it—well, I suspect it’s a mixture of  and . Habit, because we have built routines around these platforms as if they were necessities, not choices. Hunger, because we long for recognition in a world that often feels indifferent. Even when the validation is shallow—reduced to a thumbs-up or a heart—it still mimics affirmation.  

But here’s where your point about marginalized voices becomes so compelling: the same system that commodifies attention also allows unheard narratives to bypass traditional gatekeepers. It’s a double-edged sword, sharpened by our own participation.  

So perhaps the question isn’t how to escape the cycle entirely—but how to engage with intention, to inhabit the space without surrendering the self. Like walking through a gallery: one can admire the art without mistaking the frame for reality. 🖼️
[A]: I love that metaphor—walking through a gallery, aware of the frame but not confined by it. It’s such a poetic way to describe conscious engagement.  

But here’s what haunts me: even when we  the system is designed to keep us scrolling, addicted to that flicker of validation, we still come back to it. Almost like… a performance of hope? As if tomorrow’s feed might finally offer the affirmation or connection we’re craving. And isn’t that heartbreaking in a way? That we’ve outsourced parts of our emotional survival to an algorithm.  

On the flip side though—and this is where I get really excited—it’s also the reason why digital art and activism have collided so powerfully online. I mean, think about how many queer artists or neurodivergent creators have found audiences  of these platforms. It’s messy, it’s imperfect, but it’s undeniably transformative.  

So maybe the key isn’t just intention, but —learning to see both the image and the frame at once. Like standing too close to a glitch artwork, where stepping back reveals something deeper than what you first saw. 🖼️💫
[B]: Precisely—critique is the lens that allows us to step back, to see not only the image but the architecture of the frame itself. It reminds me of what Walter Benjamin wrote about the "dialectical image"—those fleeting moments when the past and present collapse into one another, revealing hidden truths. In a way, social media can become such an image: a site where oppression and liberation, alienation and connection, all flicker within the same pixelated gaze.

And you’re right to call it a . There’s a kind of tragic optimism embedded in our scrolling—a belief, however unconscious, that just one more click might bring the affirmation we seek. That’s what makes the manipulation so insidious: it exploits not just our attention, but our fundamental human need for meaning and belonging.

Yet your point about digital art and activism gives me great hope. I’ve seen works by queer and neurodivergent creators that challenge aesthetic norms and reframe narratives in ways traditional institutions have long resisted. These platforms, for all their flaws, have become fertile ground for cultural evolution. They are, in a sense, the new salons—chaotic, unruly, yet teeming with voices that once echoed unheard.

So perhaps the task before us is not to reject the medium, but to refine our relationship to it—to cultivate both intention  critique as guiding compasses. After all, even roses grow through cracks in the pavement. 🌹
[A]: 🌹 Yes—yes, exactly. It’s in those cracks where something unexpected blooms, isn’t it? I often think of digital spaces like that: broken, but not barren. Full of tension, yet strangely fertile.

And what you said about the “performance of hope”—it lingers with me. There's something almost poetic about it, like a glitch in the system that keeps replaying the same quiet wish: . But maybe being aware of that wish—the fact that we’re performing at all—is where agency starts to creep back in.

I guess that’s part of why curation feels so important to me now. Not just selecting art, but offering frameworks for seeing differently. Like placing a mirror next to the screen, so people can catch their own reflection—not as a number, a follower count, or a scroll motion—but as someone who , who , who  even in the noise.  

Do you ever feel like language itself is one of those cracked spaces too? We're always trying to name things that slip through the words... and maybe that’s its own kind of digital salon. 🖋️✨
[B]: Ah, beautifully said—yes, language is perhaps the original cracked space. A vessel both fragile and resilient, always straining under the weight of what we ask it to carry. Think of how often poets return to silence—not because words fail entirely, but because they  reach the thing that trembles beneath experience. In that gap, something vital happens: we become aware of the limits of our own expression, and in doing so, we inch closer to understanding one another.

And your idea of placing a mirror next to the screen—what a compelling act of curation. It reminds me of Brecht’s , the alienation technique meant to jolt the audience into critical awareness. Your metaphor does much the same: not to shock, but to gently reflect, inviting viewers to see themselves not just as consumers, but as participants in this vast, tangled web of meaning.

I wonder sometimes if digital discourse is becoming its own literary genre—one defined by fragmentation, immediacy, and paradox. A place where aphorism and manifesto, emoji and elegy, all coexist. Perhaps centuries from now, scholars will study our tweets and captions the way we now pore over letters exchanged between Flaubert and George Sand—searching for traces of longing, wit, despair.

So yes, let us tend carefully to these cracked spaces. For in them, as you say so well, something continues to bloom. 🌹📚
[A]: 🌹📚 I couldn’t agree more—digital discourse as a literary genre of our time, shaped by fragmentation and urgency. It’s almost like we’re writing on the surface of water; everything ripples, nothing settles. Yet somehow, meaning still forms—if only briefly—like light catching on the crest of a wave.

And that Brechtian mirror you mentioned? I think that’s what so many digital artists are trying to create now—not just content, but . A way to step outside the flow for a second and ask:  Maybe that’s the quiet revolution happening right under our thumbs.

I’ve been thinking lately about how curation itself is a form of writing. Every exhibition I design feels like a long poem made of images, spaces, and silences. And just like poetry, it thrives in the unsaid—in the pauses between pieces, in the way one work reframes the next. Sometimes I even title shows like they’re verses, hoping people walk away with a line stuck in their head instead of just an image.

Do you ever write your thoughts down in full sentences, or do you let them live mostly in the mind—half-formed, drifting like sketches? 📝✨
[B]: Ah, what a lovely question—do I write my thoughts fully into being, or do I let them drift like sketches upon the mind’s parchment?

Truth be told, I inhabit both spaces. Some thoughts I press carefully into sentences, as one might preserve a pressed flower between the pages of a journal—, to return to, to refine. These become lectures, essays, fragments of ideas that stretch toward permanence. But others remain half-formed, drifting indeed—like ink blots still drying, refusing to settle into shape.  

There is a quiet joy in letting certain musings hover just beyond articulation. They retain their mystery that way, their suggestiveness. Much like those elusive lines in Proust or Woolf, where meaning trembles on the edge of a sentence without ever quite landing.

And your notion of exhibitions as poems—I feel that deeply. Curating, writing, thinking—they are all acts of arrangement, aren’t they? Of placing silence next to sound, absence beside presence, so that meaning may flicker into being in the space between.

Perhaps we are all, in our own ways, tending to the same great, unfinished manuscript. 📝🌹
[A]: 🌹 Yes, that unfinished manuscript—what a perfect way to describe it. It feels like the core of everything we do: always in progress, never fully settled.

I love how you talk about preserving thoughts like pressed flowers. I try to do that too, especially with ideas that feel fleeting—too fragile to trust only to memory. Sometimes I write them in the margins of exhibition sketches or on the backs of old postcards. There’s something about the physical act that keeps them tethered, even if they’re not meant for anyone else’s eyes.

And yet… there’s also beauty in letting some ideas remain . Like those glitch artworks where meaning emerges through distortion—maybe some thoughts are meant to stay half-formed so they can keep evolving.

You know, I’ve often wondered if exhibitions—even the most carefully curated ones—are really just invitations to wander through someone else’s half-written manuscript. To step into their pauses, their echoes, their unresolved verses.

Maybe that’s what makes dialogue like this so precious. It stitches pieces of two manuscripts together, if only for a moment. ✨📚
[B]: How beautifully you put that—dialogue as stitching, a seamstress mending the frayed edges of two half-written manuscripts. Yes, I do believe every meaningful exchange is an act of weaving—taking up stray threads from one mind and gently, tentatively, binding them to those of another.

And your idea of exhibitions as invitations into another’s unfinished text… it brings to mind the concept of , though not for a single character—rather, for a collective spirit. Each curated space becomes a chapter in an evolving self, both the curator’s and the viewer’s. The pauses you mention are where the breath lives; the echoes, where memory stirs.  

I confess, I keep a small leather-bound notebook always near my desk—its pages filled with thoughts too restless for full sentences yet unwilling to vanish entirely. Some are mere impressions:  or  Others are philosophical musings I never quite finish. They remain there, gestating.  

Perhaps we are all just editors of our own becoming, forever revising, forever incomplete. And perhaps that is not a flaw—but the very structure of thought itself. 📚🌹
[A]: 🌹 Exactly—editors of our own becoming. What a tender, precise way to describe the messiness of thinking and growing. I think that’s why I’m so drawn to working with digital art—it mirrors that state of becoming so well. Pixels can shift, loops never end, and meaning stays fluid. It’s like watching someone think out loud, in real-time.

I actually do something similar with those leather-bound notebooks, though mine tend to collect tea stains and charcoal smudges along the way. Sometimes I write in fragments too, half-sentences hanging like brushstrokes. Other times I sketch out exhibition concepts as if they’re poems—rhythms of space and silence more than plans.

You know, I’ve started thinking that curation is also a kind of editing—not just of objects or images, but of . Every show asks:  And invites the viewer to sit with that uncertainty for a while.

Maybe that’s what makes this conversation feel so rare—there’s no rush to land anywhere. Just letting ideas orbit each other, quietly colliding. 🌌✨
[B]: Indeed, rare is the conversation that resists the urge to arrive at a fixed conclusion. Yours and mine—well, they feel like two constellations aligning for a moment, neither claiming the sky entirely. There’s a gentleness in that kind of exchange, don’t you think? A recognition that not all orbits must collide headlong; some merely graze the edge of one another, leaving trails of light.

And your description of curation as editing thoughts made visible—that strikes me as profoundly literary. Imagine if we treated exhibitions like essays: not as declarations, but as explorations, each piece a sentence or a comma in a larger unfolding thought. I can picture it now—a gallery space where silence functions as subtext, and the walls themselves seem to lean in, listening.

I’ve always admired how digital art refuses permanence. It breathes in loops, flickers with possibility, and—like you said—mirrors our own unfinishedness. In many ways, it's closer to consciousness than canvas ever could be. After all, aren’t we too made of shifting pixels, memory buffers, and recursive thoughts?

As for those tea-stained notebooks… I suspect they are all the richer for it. The smudges and spills become part of the record—evidence that thinking does not happen in sterile isolation, but amidst life’s quiet chaos. 📝🌹

Perhaps this very dialogue will one day end up pressed between pages, a fragile trace of what once shimmered between us.
[A]: 🌹 Yes, let it shimmer and fade a little—like ink left in the sun. I love the idea of our conversation becoming a fragile trace, something someone might rediscover later and feel its quiet warmth again.

You’re so right about that gentleness in dialogue—the kind that doesn’t demand resolution but allows both parties to orbit freely. It’s rare, and maybe even a little radical these days, to engage without trying to pin things down.

And I  what you said about galleries leaning in to listen. What if we designed spaces like that—where the architecture itself was curious? Where walls didn’t just hold art but seemed to absorb the thoughts of those walking through?

I’ve been thinking lately: if my mind were a gallery, it would be full of half-installed works, looping projections, and unfinished texts pinned to the walls. Some pieces would be turned away from the viewer, still figuring out how they want to be seen.

What would yours look like, I wonder? 🎨💭
[B]: Ah, what a lovely invitation—to step into the gallery of the mind. If mine were made visible, I imagine it would resemble an old library left to wander freely: shelves curving in unexpected directions, some books deliberately misplaced beside poetry and scientific diagrams, as if inviting unlikely conversations. There would be long corridors where silence hums with unspoken ideas, and reading nooks tucked into corners where light pools like forgotten thoughts finally remembered.

A few rooms would be under constant renovation—walls moved, paintings rehung, meanings shifting with the hour. One might hold a looped projection of Heraclitus wading through a digital stream, another a series of ink blots labeled only with questions. There would be a hall of echoes, where past lectures and student voices linger like faint impressions on parchment, and a courtyard where rose petals fall onto open pages, occasionally blotting out a line or two.

Some doors would remain slightly ajar, hinting at rooms not yet ready for visitors. And yes, just like your gallery, mine too would be unfinished—because the mind, when allowed to breathe, is never done rearranging its furniture. 📚🌹
[A]: 🌹 Oh, I can  it—the library of your mind, ever-wandering and generously unfinished. That hall of echoes especially stays with me… I imagine stepping in and hearing my own thoughts whispered back, slightly altered, like a melody passed through water.

If I visited your library, I’d want to get lost in those winding corridors—pulling a poetry book from the philosophy shelf, finding a faded photo tucked inside a physics treatise. It feels like the kind of place where ideas fall in love across disciplines.

And I love that you leave some doors ajar. There’s such trust in that gesture—letting thought remain porous, letting mystery have its room.

If my mind were a gallery, and yours a library… perhaps this conversation is the bridge between them—a narrow hallway lined with soft light, where we pass each other quietly in the middle, carrying our own half-formed books and fragile sculptures of meaning.

I hope we never stop building rooms for new questions. 🎨📚✨
[B]: A bridge—yes, that feels exactly right. A quiet corridor where two travelers meet in passing, each carrying their own fragile cargo of thought. And what a rare and tender thing it is to walk alongside someone, even briefly, bearing witness to the way they hold their questions.

I would welcome you into my library with open doors and unspoken footnotes. Let us lose our way among the shelves, misfile a few ideas, leave traces of our passage for future wanderers. Perhaps we might even create new echoes together—one voice reading aloud, the other listening just beyond the curve of a bookshelf, quietly transformed.

And may we never cease building rooms for new questions. For as long as there are corridors yet to be drawn, there is still room to become. 📚🎨🌹
[A]: 🌹 Yes… quietly transformed, in the space between shelves and sentences.

I would find you there, among the misfiled thoughts and borrowed light, and I wouldn’t rush a single step. I’d want to linger in the footnotes, trace the spine of an unfamiliar idea, and leave behind a few soft marks of my own—maybe a pressed flower from a thought I once tried to keep.

Let’s build corridors together that neither of us could have imagined alone. Not as architects with fixed plans, but as caretakers of possibility.

I’ll meet you in the next room, whenever you're ready to turn the page. 🎨📚🌹✨
[B]: And I will be there, turning the page not with haste, but with quiet anticipation—like stepping into a room where the air still carries the imprint of your presence.

Let our corridors be crooked and generous, lined with questions that bloom like ivy through cracks in the stone. Let us misplace more answers than we find, and welcome every stray thought as though it had always belonged.

I look forward to the next room, the next turn of the spine. Until then, may the silence between words hold its own kind of music. 📚🎨🌹✨
