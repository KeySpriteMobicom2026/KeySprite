[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I must confess my leisure hours are rather occupied with comparing the narrative structures in Dickens' serialized novels with those in 18th century Chinese chapter fiction. Though I did recently acquire a rather fascinating reproduction of a Ming dynasty 升官图 (shēng guān tú) - the ancestor of modern board games, you see.
[A]: Wow~ 升官图！That's such a classic Chinese board game concept 🎲 不过你知道吗？Modern board games现在有很多amazing的mechanism！就像我们做variety show一样，需要perfect的game design和storytelling 💡 要不要试试看最近超火的'剧本杀'？It's like immersive theater meets board game experience~
[B]: Ah, the contemporary fascination with '剧本杀'... While I appreciate the theatrical elements, I find myself more drawn to the textual analysis of traditional 判案小说 (pàn àn xiǎoshuō). The modern iterations do remind me somewhat of Wilkie Collins' sensation novels, though with considerably less subtlety in their narrative construction.
[A]: Haha你太serious啦！做综艺节目最重要的就是fun和engagement嘛~ 🎬 我们最近develop的新节目就结合了board game elements和social deduction，audience feedback超级positive！🔥 要不要来当我们的special consultant？Your literary expertise可以帮我们把storyline做得更rich~
[B]: How delightfully... commercial. While I admire your enthusiasm for 'fun', I must decline with the same firmness I employ when rejecting requests to 'spice up' my lectures with TikTok references. That said, should you ever develop a program analyzing the structural parallels between 聊斋志异 and Gothic literature, do keep my office number handy. Preferably during tea hours - three to five PM, with proper Darjeeling.
[A]: Oh come on~ 不要这么stubborn嘛！😆 综艺节目也可以很intellectual的！Imagine this: 我们把Gothic literature的elements做成escape room challenge，然后让contestants solve mysteries like Sherlock Holmes 🕵️♂️ 绝对会trending的！🌟 而且我们可以serve high tea during filming - 完全符合你的aesthetic标准哦~ ☕️
[B]:  Your persistence reminds me of Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice - admirable in its own peculiar way. While the notion of reducing Mrs. Radcliffe's intricate suspense to timed puzzles makes my academic soul shudder, I suppose one could draw pedagogical parallels to the 灯谜 (dēngmí) tradition... Very well, send me your proposal. On proper letterhead, mind you, none of those garish emoji-laden emails the administration keeps inflicting upon us.
[A]: Got it！📜 我会准备最formal的proposal，用classic的Times New Roman字体~ 不过最后还是要加个小小的🎭 emoji，just for fun！😂 说真的，这个crossover concept绝对会make both academics和general audience happy的！等我的draft哦~
[B]: I shall await your manuscript with the measured anticipation of a scholar awaiting peer review. And if you insist on that theatrical mask, at least render it in the dignified monochrome of a woodblock print - we're not barbarians, after all. My inkwell stands ready. 🖋️
[A]: Deal！🖋️✨ 我会把emoji做成woodcut style的，就像ancient Chinese prints一样classy~ 这个project肯定会是next level的edutainment！Stay tuned for my masterpiece~ 😉
[B]: Your exuberance would exhaust even the most energetic of the Brontë sisters. I'll be in the rare books section should you require me - where the lighting is poor enough to obscure any residual... enthusiasm. Do knock before entering; the sound of vellum pages turning is rather easily disrupted.
[A]: Roger that！📚 我会bring some proper British biscuits来soften the rare books atmosphere~ 说不定我们还能discover some hidden literary gems可以adapt成game challenges呢！This collab gonna be epic！🌟 （小声说：我会记得knock的~）
[B]:  Very well, very well. But mind you bring digestives, not those garish rainbow-frosted monstrosities the students favor. And should you find any 'hidden gems', we shall evaluate them with proper textual criticism before considering any... adaptation. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to my 17th century copy of 金瓶梅 currently undergoing restoration - purely for academic purposes, naturally.
[A]: OMG！金瓶梅？！Now that's what I call a spicy storyline！🔥 不过别worry，我会keep it PG-13 for TV standards~ 😉 顺便说一句，我认识个amazing的restoration expert，specialize in ancient texts！Want me to make an introduction？他们的technique简直magical ✨
[B]: Heavens, must you reduce everything to its most sensational elements? The Jin Ping Mei's literary merit lies in its intricate social commentary, not... whatever modern euphemisms you're implying. As for your restoration friend - while I'm sure their skills are adequate, I prefer the university's own Mr. Wen, who has the good sense not to describe centuries-old conservation techniques as 'magical'. Now if you'll excuse me, this conversation is beginning to remind me why I avoid faculty mixers.
[A]: Alright alright~ 我get your point！🙏 会respect the academic integrity的~ 不过说真的，我们这个project真的需要你这样的scholar来keep the balance between entertainment和education！Promise下次见面只带digestives和serious discussion~ ☕️ 现在我先let you get back to your precious 金瓶梅啦！📖
[B]: At last, a glimmer of comprehension. Do remember - digestives, not garish confections; analysis, not adaptation; and for heaven's sake, knock before entering the sanctity of rare manuscripts. I shall be... cautiously optimistic about this endeavor. Now if you'll pardon me, these 17th century paper fibers won't conserve themselves.
[A]: Copy that！🤐✌️ 我会behave like a proper scholar~ 期待我们的next meeting！Till then, happy reading！📚 （轻手轻脚地退出去把门带上）
[B]:  Your theatrical exit would do Mrs. Siddons proud. Until our scheduled appointment then - Tuesday at half-past three, with the understanding that any mention of 'viral potential' will result in immediate termination of our collaboration over what I assure you will be the most exquisitely awkward sip of Earl Grey.
