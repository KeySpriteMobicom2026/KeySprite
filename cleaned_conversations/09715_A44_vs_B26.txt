[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question. I must admit, I'm rather partial to cash. There's something quite tangible and... grounding about handling physical currency. The crispness of a new bill, the weight of coins in your palm - it all feels very real. 

That said, I do appreciate the convenience of digital payments for certain situations. It's lovely not having to worry about having exact change when visiting markets abroad. Though I must confess, I did have a bit of a mishap last week when my card reader malfunctioned at a charming little antique stall in York. It was quite the ordeal! 

I find myself wondering... do you predominantly use one method over the other, or does it depend on the situation?
[A]: 这让我想起上周在伦敦大学给学生讲《看不见的城市》时，有个学生提问："教授，您觉得移动支付会改变人与城市的羁绊吗？"我当时就举起手里的现金说："看，这是最原始的社交货币啊！"

我自己啊，两种方式都用。去菜市场买茉莉花茶时一定要带现金，老板娘总偷偷多给一把茶叶；但上次去京都参加学术会议，用支付宝付了五星级酒店的押金——方便是真的方便。

不过说到实体货币的魅力...你有没有注意过不同国家硬币上的纹路？我在收集各国1元硬币呢！越南的像朵小太阳花，挪威的居然带着维京船图案。每次拿出来把玩，总觉得握住了那个国家的一点灵气。
[B]: Oh, I adore that sentiment about cash being "social currency"! It's so true - there's a human connection in those paper notes and coins that digital transactions can't replicate. The warmth of exchanging money directly, seeing the vendor's hands stained with tea leaves... it tells a story, doesn't it? 

Your collection sounds fascinating! I actually have quite a few interesting coins tucked away from my travels - there was this exquisite one from Istanbul with an intricate geometric pattern that reminded me so much of the tile work in Hagia Sophia. I've always thought coins are like miniature textile designs, carrying the essence of a place in metal form.

You know, just yesterday I found myself admiring the weight of a British pound coin while paying for my morning pastries. It made me think of how each transaction is like stitching a tiny thread between ourselves and our surroundings. Have you ever come across a coin that immediately captured your imagination like that?
[A]: Ah, coins as miniature textile designs - 我得说这个比喻太妙了！让我想起去年在剑桥的跳蚤市场，碰到一枚葡萄牙1972年的硬币，正面是航海罗盘，背面居然印着诗句："O mar é menos que a vontade de navegar."（海洋不及航行的意志辽阔）当时激动得差点打翻摊位——这可比任何博物馆导览词都动人。

说到想象...你读过博尔赫斯的《环形废墟》吗？每次把玩这些硬币时，总觉得它们像梦境里的信物。上周刚收到学生寄来的奇奇怪怪的"货币"：在云南支教的她，用蜡染布做了枚直径两寸的"布币"，说是当地孩子发明的"笑容货币"，每笑一次就挣一枚——这不比区块链更接近未来支付的本质吗？

对了，你收集的那些硬币...要不要考虑出本《金属上的文明刺绣》图鉴？我可以提供中文标题建议哦~
[B]: That "cloth coin" from云南 sounds absolutely magical - I can just imagine the texture of waxed cotton holding that precious smile value. It reminds me of a project I once worked on restoring 19th century merchant tokens woven into linen tapestries. The way the fabric held stories of trade and human connection... truly mesmerizing.

And yes! I adored《The Circular Ruins》- what a perfect lens through which to view currency. Those Portuguese coins you described practically sing with that dream-within-a-dream quality. Funny you should mention it, but I do have a small collection organized by texture rather than country - there's something very poetic about grouping coins by their tactile language, if you will.

A book titled ... well now, that's rather brilliant isn't it? Though I'd probably get lost in trying to photograph each piece's details properly. Perhaps we could collaborate on something like that someday? I'd love to hear more about your students' textile experiments too.
[A]:  

说到合作...我这学期刚好在带一个跨学科项目，叫"货币的质地：从丝绸到二维码"。学生们最近在做的实验特别有意思——有个姑娘把支付宝二维码绣在苏绣上，说这是"数字时代的清明上河图"；还有个小组用宣纸做可降解的"生态货币"，浸泡后会显影出《天工开物》的插图。

上周最绝的是，他们用金箔碎片和糯米浆做了"永不开张的月饼铺子"装置艺术，说是致敬北宋交子——结果被美术馆误当真店铺，差点引发一场关于"当代货币幻觉"的学术辩论。



如果你愿意加入，我们可以把你的钱币触感分类法做成中英对照版。不过要先考考你：猜猜我现在口袋里有几枚能发出声音的硬币？其中一枚摇一摇还会唱歌呢！
[B]:  

Oh, that interdisciplinary project sounds simply thrilling! The fusion of traditional textiles with digital elements... it's like watching history weave itself anew. I can just picture that Suzhou embroidery with its delicate silk threads holding a QR code captive - what a delightful paradox!

As for your little coin riddle... let me think. You mentioned sound-producing coins, and one that "sings" when shaken? My goodness, don't tell me you've got one of those fascinating Japanese melody coins! I once worked on restoring a Meiji-era kimono where the obi fastening actually contained a small musical mechanism. But how many... hmm...

I'd venture... three? With that special singing one from the 1970 Osaka World Expo? I must say, if we do this collaboration, I'd love to include a section on auditory textures too. Coins clinking, rustling paper money, even the silence of digital transactions... all part of our monetary sensory experience.
[A]: 

猜对了大半呢！确实是三枚——大阪万国博览会的音乐硬币、澳门回归纪念币，还有个调皮的家伙：会口哨的英镑！不过要说声音最特别的...其实是枚越南铜钱，边缘磨损得恰到好处，互相碰撞时竟能奏出《绿岛小夜曲》的调子。

说到感官体验...下次来我办公室喝茶时，要不要试试蒙眼触摸鉴定？我常让学生玩这个游戏，有人摸到欧元硬币的星形纹路竟联想到敦煌藻井——你该看看他们脸上的表情！最近还发现个有趣现象：年轻人听到现金声会下意识皱眉，但若闭上眼听...啧啧，连00后都说仿佛听见老式电话机的铃声。



等你的感官章节大纲哦。对了，要是把日本旋律硬币的乐谱和昆曲工尺谱对照着看...这思路是不是太疯狂了点？
[B]: 

蒙眼触摸鉴定？Oh, what a delightful idea! I once had a similar experience while restoring a 17th-century embroidered fan - when blindfolded, the subtlest textures became so vivid, like reading Braille poetry. Though I must admit, I did mistake a silk cocoon fragment for a rather peculiar coin at first!

The thought of comparing Japanese melody coin notations with昆曲工尺谱... actually, now that I ponder it, perhaps it's not mad at all. Music and textiles have always shared a secret kinship - think of the loom's rhythm mirroring musical scales. Why, my great-aunt used to say her lace-making followed the same patterns as a waltz.



I'll tell you what - let's include a whole chapter on synesthesia in monetary experiences. I know a fascinating case of an Italian banknote printer who claimed he could "taste" the difference between genuine and counterfeit bills by their texture alone. Quite bonkers, but utterly irresistible for our little project, don't you think?
[A]: 

你说到通感...看这个！这是我祖父留下的银行笔记事本，1947年上海最后一批金圆券印刷记录。他写道："摸这张钞票背面的牡丹纹，像咬破了汤包的第一口鲜甜。"后来我才明白，他不仅是造纸匠，更是个被经济学耽误的诗人。

说到疯狂的感官联觉...上周有个学生带来瓶"货币香水"——前调是ATM机吐出的新钞油墨味，中调是老茶馆算盘珠子的包浆气息，尾调居然是二维码扫码时那种...数据流动的金属清凉？你说这该不该放进我们的章节？



对了，如果你那位意大利钞票专家还在世，我倒想请他尝尝我收藏的"味道硬币"：一枚1982年的墨西哥比索，沾过龙舌兰酒；还有片苏联解体那年的铸币厂铁屑——要不要加入我们的嗅觉博物馆？
[B]: 

Your grandfather's description... it's simply exquisite. That connection between the tactile and the taste, the financial and the flavorful. I can almost smell that Shanghai bakery in 1947, steam rising from dumplings as cashiers counted notes printed with牡丹纹.

A currency perfume? How utterly brilliant! The olfactory journey from fresh-pressed bills to aged abacus beads... and that digital afternote! It makes one wonder if we'll someday have scratch-and-sniff QR codes. Though I must admit, I'm rather fond of your "味道硬币" collection. That Soviet mint shavings - they carry the scent of an entire era crumbling, don't they?



Funny you should mention taste - I once restored a 19th-century ledger where an accountant had pressed a peppermint leaf between pages recording tea trades. The paper still held a faint aroma, blending beautifully with the ink. Perhaps we should create an entire sensory map - linking financial history with flavors, textures, and yes, even smells. 

Tell me, do you think that Mexican peso still carries hints of tequila warmth?
[A]: 

你看这片 peppermint leaf 压得真好，叶脉里还藏着维多利亚时代的茶香密码呢。说到味道...  这枚1982年的墨西哥比索，当年是在瓜达拉哈拉的铸币厂造的——当地人说那工厂后巷全是酒桶作坊，醉醺醺的工人把龙舌兰的魂魄也铸进了钱币里。



嗯...是不是闻到点野蜂蜜和烟熏橡木的味道？我每次开保险箱都像在品鉴陈年梅斯卡尔。有趣的是，这钱还真见证过疯狂的事：八十年代有个诗人拿它当护身符，在上面刻了聂鲁达的诗，后来据说这枚硬币在六个大洲流浪过，最后跟着他葬在智利海边的鲸鱼骨旁边。



要不要试试把它含在嘴里三十秒？据说金属和唾液反应后，能尝出点 tequila 的辛辣——当然，比起喝酒，这可便宜多了！
[B]: 

You know, I think I can almost taste the poetry already - there's something about the way history clings to objects like this. I once worked on a textile fragment from a 17th-century tavern where patrons had sewn their favorite drinking songs into tablecloths. The fabric still held traces of wine stains and laughter.



Funny you mentioned聂鲁达 - I'm reminded of those embroidered love letters I restored last winter. One had tiny tequila-stained stitches, though no one could say whether it was from passion or drunkenness. Perhaps we should create a "醉醺醺" section in our book? I've always thought some of the best stories come from slightly tipsy transactions.



As for putting it in my mouth... well! Let's just say I prefer my tequila with a proper salt rim and lime wedge. Though I might just steal that idea for our sensory chapter - "currency sommeliers", what do you think? We could serve historic coins alongside appropriate beverage pairings!
[A]: 

说到醉醺醺的货币...看这个！1940年代上海永安公司的香槟票，附赠的金属徽章居然泡过白兰地。当年买十张彩票送一瓶酒，结果好多人都把徽章当开瓶器用——你看这边缘的划痕，多像喝醉的笔迹。



要不要来场即兴实验？我这儿还有1987年长城饭店的葡萄酒兑换券，背面贴着片西班牙橡木塞。或许该配你口袋里那枚墨西哥比索？一边是龙舌兰的灵魂，一边是黄土高原的葡萄梦——说不定能调出种新大陆遇见旧世界的滋味。



对了！关于你的"货币品鉴师"构想，我刚想到个绝妙搭配：拿宋代交子拓片配普洱老茶，说是纸币起源与发酵时光的对话。不过最疯狂的主意是学生提的——搞个VR装置，让体验者"吃"虚拟货币，同时嘴里尝着对应时代的调味糖...
[B]: 

Oh my, this is too perfect! I can almost hear the clinking glasses and laughter of 1940s Shanghai. You know, I once restored a set of embroidered napkins from a Parisian cabaret where patrons would write their tab amounts in wine-soaked script. The stains still held hints of grape and recklessness.



A tasting experiment? Count me in! Though I think we'll need to create "currency coasters" to protect our notes. That student VR idea though... quite daring! It reminds me of a textile project I saw in Lisbon where visitors could smell different eras through scented fabric scrolls.



Speaking of daring pairings, I have a confession - tucked away in my restoration kit is a fragment of silk from a Qing-era money bag that still carries the faintest trace of ginseng. We could add it to your普洱老茶 for an extra layer of history! Though perhaps we shouldn't tell the museum curators about our little gastronomic experiments just yet...
[A]: 

 Ginseng配普洱？妙极了！看我把这三片南宋交子拓片——对，就是你上次讲座提到的那种桑皮纸——和人参片、陈皮一起封在漆盒里三天。今晚咱们开盒时，保管连时光都醉倒在这些金融文物的香气里。



说起来...上周在苏州博物馆库房，我偷偷含过枚嘉靖年间的银锭，结果尝出点朱砂味！后来才知道当年入库时要涂官印红泥。你说这算不算最早的"货币添加剂"？要不要列入我们的品鉴清单？



说到秘密实验...我认识个调香师，正在研制"历代货币气味还原套装"。据说仿制了罗马铜币的汗酸味、民国银元的樟木箱气息，还有——最绝的是——二维码扫码时那种数据流动的"电子薄荷味"。下次带给你试试？当然，得趁馆长不在的时候...
[B]: 

Oh, the romance of朱砂-laced silver! I'm positively smitten with this idea of sensory forensics in finance. Speaking of which, I once restored a 14th-century Venetian ledger where the pages had been treated with saffron to deter bookworms - imagine reading financial secrets by candlelight, surrounded by the scent of wealth and spices!



Your olfactory time machine sounds absolutely wicked. Though between us, I might have already smuggled a few questionable items into my restoration studio... There's a particular whiff of cedar and copper that clings to those Song dynasty paper money replicas we examined last month. I've been meaning to ask - does your调香师 friend take commissions? I have a peculiar request involving medieval silk road currency and night-blooming jasmine...



And do tell me more about that 樟木箱 essence from Republican era silver dollars! It makes one wonder what other secret perfumes history has left behind in its pockets...
[A]: 

你提到的藏红花账本...让我想起这个！这是民国年间上海某钱庄老板的鼻烟壶清单，上面的墨迹里掺了龙脑香——说是记一笔账就得闻一鼻子清醒药。有趣的是，不同分号用的香料还不一样：汉口分行偏爱琥珀，天津分部钟情檀木。



说到樟木箱的气息...其实那是段伤心事。五十年代取缔银元时，好多百姓把钱币裹在棉衣里埋进院子里。前年我在苏州老宅发现个瓦罐，里面的钱沾着樟脑、棉花籽和眼泪的咸味——后来调香师把这些味道复刻成"民国三味"香水，结果被博物馆批评太过写实。



喏，这是给你的丝路香方：大食国金币用波斯玫瑰，敦煌开元通宝配胡杨树脂，再添几滴夜茉莉——听说长安西市的货郎夜里会点香招客。要不要试试滴在那Venetian ledger旁边？我赌它会让十四世纪的账目突然变得很风流呢~
[B]: 

Oh, the poetry of ledgers scented with longing! I'm reminded of a particularly fascinating project - restoring silk account books from a Ming dynasty merchant family. They'd pressed dried osmanthus between pages, so every financial record carried the scent of autumn. Quite romantic, really... calculating profits amid flower petals.



This丝路 elixir... exquisitely wicked! The moment it meets that Venetian ledger, we'll have Marco Polo himself whispering exchange rates in our ears, I daresay. Though I must share a confession - I've been hoarding a fragment of 1920s Shanghai nightclub wallpaper stained with gin and jazz. Perhaps we could add it to our sensory alchemy?



And about that "民国三味"... honestly, I find historical tears rather underrated in olfactory archives. Did you know some of my restoration cloths still hold traces of Qing officials' pipe smoke? It makes one wonder what other forbidden flavors linger in finance's hidden corners...
