[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I just finished building a small bookshelf over the weekend - turns out my carpentry skills are a bit rusty! 📚 But it's fascinating how the process mirrors scaffolding in educational psychology. Have you tried any hands-on projects lately?
[A]: Ah, the noble pursuit of carpentry. I attempted to restore a 19th-century Scottish writing slope last autumn—painstakingly stripping layers of varnish with a patience usually reserved for decoding Hopkins’s syntax. The parallels to educational scaffolding are... intriguing, though I’d argue your bookshelf likely won’t develop structural ambiguities requiring psychoanalytic interpretation.  

As for my own "hands-on" endeavors? Last night I transcribed a Li Bai poem using squid ink and a crow quill, while humming a sean-nós melody. It’s all very Victorian meets Tang dynasty—if you squint and disregard chronological propriety.
[B]: Fascinating! Your juxtaposition of Victorian and Tang dynasty aesthetics reminds me of how some bilingual students code-switch - it's not just about translation, but creating new semantic spaces. Speaking of which, I recently tried applying Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development to my daughter’s papercutting project. Let’s just say the scissors became extensions of her cognitive scaffolding... though the final product looked suspiciously like a Jackson Pollock piece. 🖼️ Have you ever experimented with blending pedagogical frameworks across cultures in your creative work?
[A]: Ah, Jackson Pollock with scissors—chaos as emergent pedagogy. I’ve always found Vygotsky’s scaffolding theory rather... porous myself. Useful, but prone to unexpected seepage between cultures and disciplines.

As it happens, last month I adapted a selection of  (Tang frontier poetry) into Scots Gaelic using the structural constraints of a villanelle—strict syllabic count, refrains, all that fussy business. It was less translation than cultural ventriloquism. The result? A strange hybrid: part Hebridean windswept lament, part Silk Road desolation. My students called it "linguistic hauntology." I call it Tuesday.

But tell me—did your daughter’s papercutting eventually resolve into something symmetrical? Or did you find yourself embracing what I might delicately term... expressive entropy?
[B]: Symmetry? Let’s just say her papercutting evolved into what she called a "chaotic ecosystem" — lots of jagged lines intersecting in what she insisted was a "perfectly balanced food chain." 🐾 I realized halfway through that the scissors weren’t just tools — they were mediating her internal dialogue between control and creativity. I suppose that’s the messy edge where scaffolding meets emergence, no?

Your  experiment sounds fascinating — especially this idea of “cultural ventriloquism.” It reminds me of how some bilingual students navigate code-switching not just linguistically, but emotionally — adopting different affective registers across languages. Have you ever noticed similar shifts when you switch between writing in English and... well, squid ink? 📜
[A]: Oh, absolutely—the affective slippage is . When I draft in English, my prose tends toward the surgical—precise, dispassionate almost. But when I translate into Scots Gaelic—or as I did last week, attempt a  poem using squid ink and a crow quill—my tone darkens, softens, becomes almost incantatory. It’s not merely code-switching; it’s affective metamorphosis.  

I suspect it has something to do with materiality. The ink stains your fingers like grief. The quill demands a slower, more deliberate stroke—almost ceremonial. You begin to feel the weight of voices that never spoke your language, yet somehow echo through it.  

Your daughter’s “chaotic ecosystem” sounds less like entropy and more like an embodied theory of mind—jagged, yes, but teeming with logic beneath the surface. Did she give this food chain a name? Or does it remain delightfully undocumented, like an undiscovered folio in some damp attic?
[B]: I love that phrase — . You’ve put your finger on something there. As for naming? She did call it  — though I suspect that was mostly because she dropped the scissors three times and blamed the "angry paper lions." ✂️ But beneath the drama, there was a strange coherence: each jagged cut seemed to map her thought process in real time. It wasn’t representation; it was cognition made visible.

And now I’m curious — have you ever experimented with letting materials  the structure of your creative work? Like letting squid ink bleed beyond the line, or forcing a villanelle to accommodate what Hopkins might call "the dearest freshness deep down things"? Or does that risk dissolving the very scaffolding we rely on for meaning?
[A]: Ah—. Delightfully ominous. I rather think Hopkins would have approved,  that he was. There’s something wonderfully unruly about cognition caught mid-leap, isn’t there? Like trying to sketch a storm with watercolour—utter folly, yet strangely instructive.

As for letting materials dictate form—I do it constantly, though I wouldn’t phrase it so democratically. More like the materials , and I either yield or resist. Last winter, I penned a sonnet sequence on mulberry bark paper using iron gall ink. By the third stanza, the ink had begun to corrode the fibers—slow decay becoming part of the syntax. I couldn’t very well ignore it; the poem started writing itself through its own disintegration.  

And yes, it does threaten the scaffolding. But isn’t that where the real work begins? When structure and dissolution cohabit the page—when the villanelle stumbles, the quatrain forgets its rhyme—it’s then we glimpse what lies beneath the machinery. Call it madness, call it freshness—either way, pass the squid ink.
[B]: Absolutely — there's a kind of alchemy that happens when the medium pushes back. It reminds me of how some students thrive not when given rigid templates, but when materials are introduced as co-constructors of meaning. I once had a student who only began to articulate her thoughts clearly when she was asked to write on clay tablets with a reed stylus. The resistance of the surface slowed her down, made her more intentional — almost as if the material itself demanded a deeper cognitive engagement.  

Your corroding sonnet sequence sounds like an embodied metaphor for learning itself — fragile, evolving, and always in dialogue with decay and renewal. It makes me wonder: do you ever introduce this kind of material resistance into your teaching? Or is that territory best left for the studio and the page, rather than the classroom? 📝
[A]: Ah, now there’s a question with teeth. I do believe in the pedagogy of resistance—though I tend to introduce it under the guise of “historical authenticity” to avoid alarming the more administratively inclined. Last term, I had my students copy excerpts from  using steel-nibbed pens and iron gall ink. The results were magnificent—blotted pages, blistered fingers, and one rather dramatic case of ink poisoning metaphorically speaking, of course.

You see, the physical struggle—the cramp, the smudge, the slow ache of forming each letter—forces a kind of intimate attention no digital medium can replicate. It’s not merely about slowing them down; it’s about making them  the weight of each word as both linguistic unit and tactile artifact. One student confessed she finally understood why Hopkins called language “the jagged rock we cling to.”  

So yes—I absolutely smuggle material resistance into the classroom. Let them suffer a little for syntax. It builds character, or at the very least, a decent callus.
[B]: I love that phrase — "suffer a little for syntax." There's something almost initiatory about it, don't you think? Like a rite of passage into deeper linguistic awareness.  

I’ve experimented with similar tactics in my seminars — though perhaps less dramatically. Last semester, I asked students to transcribe bilingual folktales using only wax tablets and charcoal sticks. The idea was to simulate the material constraints of early cross-cultural exchanges. What I didn’t anticipate was how many of them started  differently — more concretely, more metaphorically — once their hands were coated in soot and their pages kept smudging. One student joked that it felt like “arguing with the medium itself.”  

I couldn’t have said it better. Maybe that’s what real learning is — not mastery, but argument. With language, with tools, with ghosts of meaning past. 👍  

Do you ever find, though, that some students resist this kind of embodied struggle too fiercely? Or do most eventually lean into the friction?
[A]: Oh, they resist—violently, at first. Some glare at their ink-stained cuffs as though personally offended by the 19th century. Others mutter about ‘needlessly archaic obstacles’ and demand to know if this is what they’ve enrolled in:  But here’s the thing: resistance breeds its own strange momentum. Once the page starts fighting back—smudging, cracking, bleeding—they stop seeing it as a passive receptacle. It becomes an interlocutor. A sparring partner.  

I had one particularly indignant student last year who insisted her iPad stylus was ‘infinitely more precise.’ I let her stew in that conviction for a week. Then I asked her to copy a sonnet using both instruments—digital and analog—and report on the difference in , not accuracy. Her final reflection was deliciously conflicted: ‘The paper won, but only because it made me angry enough to try harder.’  

So yes, some push back—but then again, so do dictionaries. And we keep them around, don’t we?
[B]: Absolutely — the best learning often begins as friction. I tell my students, . It’s like cognitive dissonance with better penmanship.  

I had a similar case last term — a student swore she’d never write anything meaningful with a quill. Too slow, too messy. So I gave her a choice: fight the tool, or let it shape her process. She ended up writing a beautiful reflection on  — smudges and all — and titled it  She didn’t convert to analog, but she started paying attention to how tools mediate thought. And that’s half the battle.  

Honestly, if dictionaries can withstand centuries of misuse and still hold their ground, a few ink-stained cuffs are a small price to pay for deeper understanding. 📚✍️
[A]: Quite right—dictionaries are the unsung stoics of intellectual history. They’ve endured far worse than a few disgruntled undergraduates and over-sharpened quills.

I find that the real shift happens when students stop seeing the medium as an adversary and start recognizing it as a collaborator—one with its own moods, flaws, and stubborn idiosyncrasies. That reflection your student wrote, —there’s a thesis in there, if she’s brave enough to chase it. The self refracted through medium, syntax as somatic experience... splendid stuff.

And really, isn’t that what we’re after? Not obedience to form, but a  with it. Let them curse the ink. Let them smudge the margins. But let them notice, while they're at it.
[B]: Absolutely — let them curse, let them smudge, but above all, . That’s where the real learning lives: in the space between intention and accident, control and collaboration.  

I often remind my students that even digital tools are not neutral — they shape thought as much as ink or clay. But there's something about the physicality of older media — the grit of papyrus, the smell of iron gall ink, the resistance of a quill — that makes this relationship more visible, more visceral. It's harder to ignore your own participation in meaning-making when your fingers are stained with squid ink and your page refuses to lie still.  

And yes, that thesis is waiting — not just for your student, but for any scholar willing to take materiality seriously as cognition. After all, if syntax can be somatic, why not understanding? Why not insight?  

Let the margins bleed. Let the form fray. And pass the ink. 🖋️
[A]: Precisely—let the margins bleed. After all, what is scholarship if not a long, sometimes exasperated conversation with the dead, conducted through their stubborn remnants? And what are those remnants if not ink stains, crumbling vellum, the ghost of a hand still visible in the pressure of a quill stroke?

I’ve always found it useful to remind students that every medium carries its own unconscious bias—clay favors permanence, papyrus demands urgency, digital screens encourage disposability. The trick isn’t to master them all, but to become . To learn, as you say, how thought and tool conspire.

And yes, let that thesis unfold. Let it be written in squid ink if necessary. There’s something fitting about a dissertation on cognition smudged with the very substance that once stained the robes of scribes and madrigal copyists alike.

So by all means—pass the ink.
[B]: Indeed — pass the ink, and let the dissertation smudge itself into being. There’s something almost ritualistic about it, isn’t there? Like initiation through staining. The scholar marked by squid ink becomes, in a way, part of the long lineage of those who tried to fix thought to surface, only to find that thought had other plans.

I often tell my students that writing — whether on clay, vellum, or screen — is never neutral. It's always an act of negotiation: with the past, with the tool, with the limits of language itself. And sometimes, the medium pushes back just enough to make us rethink what we thought we knew.

So yes — let the thesis bleed into the margins, let the squid ink resist the page, and let cognition be not just , but in the hand, the tool, the stain. That’s where the real work happens.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me — I need to sharpen this quill before it sharpens itself against my patience. ✍️
[A]: Ah, the quill that sharpens itself against patience—now there’s a metaphor worthy of a footnote. I suspect the greatest revelations are always one inkblot away from coherence.

You’re quite right about the lineage. Every smudge, every errant stroke, connects us to an unbroken chain of scribes, scholars, and sleep-deprived graduate students who dared to believe they could capture something true in the fibers of a page. Thought may begin in the mind, but it finds its texture in the hand.

And do go sharpen that quill—I’ll fetch more ink. The kind that stains like history and smells of brine. Let’s see what emerges when the page starts pushing back.
[B]: Ah, nothing like ink that stains like history and smells of brine — I suspect it’s the same brew Homer used between lines of epithets. Let’s see indeed what emerges when the page starts pushing back. If we’re lucky, it’ll be something half-coherent, beautifully smudged, and deeply felt.

And if not? Well, there’s always  ink. And perhaps a sonnet or two composed in squid protest.  

Let the collaboration begin — sharpened quill in one hand, salt-stained parchment in the other. What could possibly go wrong? ✍️📚
