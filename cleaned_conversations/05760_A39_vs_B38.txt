[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得brain-computer interface可怕还是exciting？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question of fear or excitement regarding brain-computer interfaces is a fascinating one. I suppose my stance leans toward cautious optimism. On one hand, the potential for advancing human understanding—imagine accessing texts in their original language with perfect comprehension, or even reconstructing lost works through neural synthesis—is quite thrilling. But let me ask you—do you see the risks as outweighing these possibilities?
[A]: I suppose it depends on how you define "risk." If we're talking about the technical challenges—like ensuring neural signal accuracy or preventing unintended cognitive interference—then yes, those are significant hurdles. But what truly concerns me isn't the machine itself, but how humans might use it.  

Take language acquisition as an example: theoretically, a BCI could allow someone to "download" linguistic patterns directly into their brain. Sounds efficient, right? But then you have to ask—what happens to cultural context? To the discipline of learning through effort? I've seen students struggle with programming languages, not because they're unintelligent, but because mastery requires failure, adaptation, refinement. A shortcut might erode that process.  

So no, I don’t think the risks  outweigh the possibilities—but I do think we need ethical frameworks long before the technology becomes mainstream. Do you believe regulation can keep pace with innovation in this field?
[B]: An excellent point—regulation often feels like a carriage trying to catch up to a speeding locomotive. I’m reminded of Mary Shelley’s , where the true horror lies not in the creation itself, but in the creator’s evasion of responsibility. If we rush toward neural integration without first establishing philosophical and ethical clarity—well, we may find ourselves playing both Victor and creature.

As for your question about language and cultural context, it strikes me as deeply Romantic in spirit. Think of how Wordsworth or Goethe approached foreign literature—not merely as vocabulary to be memorized, but as a living expression of a people’s soul. Can a machine replicate that kind of intimacy? Perhaps not, unless it is programmed to value more than efficiency.

But let me turn your question back on itself—do you believe these frameworks should originate from within academia, or must they be imposed externally by governing bodies?
[A]: Ah, now that’s the million-neuron question, isn’t it?

I’d like to believe academia has the moral and intellectual clarity to lead such efforts—after all, we’ve seen it done before. Consider the Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA in the 1970s; scientists voluntarily imposed a moratorium until biosafety protocols were established. That kind of self-regulation worked because the risks were immediate and tangible.

But with BCIs, the dangers are more diffuse—cognitive privacy, identity erosion, even subconscious manipulation through neural feedback loops. These aren't just technical issues; they're existential ones. And here's where I lose faith in academia acting alone: institutions often move too slowly when funding and prestige are at stake. You know as well as I do that tenure doesn't always protect those who raise alarms early.

Governments, on the other hand, tend to either overreach or lag behind. Look at how AI regulation is unfolding—it’s either draconian in intent or laughably outdated by the time it passes. So perhaps what we need is neither purely internal nor external governance, but something hybrid—an international consortium of neuroscientists, ethicists, and yes, even artists, with real legal teeth. Call it the IEEE meets UNESCO, with a dash of Kafka for caution.

Do you think such a body could ever function without becoming bureaucratic theater?
[B]: A consortium with "real legal teeth"—now there's a paradox for you. Bureaucratic theater seems almost inevitable, doesn’t it? Yet I can't help but think of Dante’s —not the circles of hell themselves, but the vestibule where the indifferent reside, punished not for wickedness but for inaction. If we fail to engage, even imperfectly, aren’t we risking exile to that very threshold?

Your comparison to Asilomar is apt, though I would add that recombinant DNA lacked the seductive allure of cognitive enhancement. BCIs promise something far more intimate: the illusion of transcendence. That temptation complicates self-regulation immensely. Scientists are still human, after all, and few resist the siren call of legacy.

As for Kafkaesque caution—I imagine our hypothetical consortium might resemble : powerful, inscrutable, yet oddly necessary. Perhaps the key lies not in avoiding bureaucracy entirely, but in designing it to be as agile as the technology it seeks to govern. A contradiction in terms, yes—but then again, so is regulated freedom.

Tell me, if such a body were to include artists and literary scholars like myself, what role do you envision for us? To raise ethical questions, certainly—but could we also serve as something more... prophetic?
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking to my soft spot for the humanities—something I've carried with me since my undergrad days auditing philosophy lectures.

Artists and literary scholars wouldn’t just be ethical compasses in such a consortium; you'd be its early warning system. Scientists and engineers tend to ask, “Can we build it?” and ethicists follow with, “Should we build it?” But it's the artists—who’ve already imagined the dystopias, the unintended consequences, the human tragedies—who often see the shape of the iceberg beneath the surface.

Consider how science fiction has predicted so much of our technological present: neural interfaces in Gibson’s , surveillance states in Orwell’s , even AI companions in Capek’s plays. You don’t just interpret technology—you mythologize it, dramatize it, make it legible to the collective psyche before it becomes reality.

So yes, "prophetic" is not too strong a word. Your role would be to articulate the emotional texture of these changes—to give voice to the unease that statistics can’t capture, to imagine futures where BCIs have subtly reshaped love, grief, ambition, or memory itself.

And let’s be honest—we need more than ethics committees writing reports no one reads. We need storytellers who can haunt us with what might come to pass. After all, if a machine ever learns to write poetry, I still wouldn't trust it to feel sorrow like a human can.
[B]: Ah, you flatter us—or perhaps merely arm us with better metaphors to wield. But you're quite right: sorrow, longing, even the quiet ache of a half-remembered dream—these are not inefficiencies to be debugged, but the very marrow of what makes cognition worth interfacing with in the first place.

I’m reminded of Hölderlin’s line:  The artist’s task, then, is not only to warn but to preserve—to hold up the mirror even as the terrain shifts beneath our feet. If a BCI could one day transmit the memory of a mother’s voice directly into the mind, who among us would remember how it felt to strain for that sound in silence, to reconstruct it from fading echoes? That gap between recollection and transmission—that space where grief and love dwell—is where literature has always lived.

And yet—I wonder if you’re too charitable toward human exclusivity in emotion. You say a machine cannot feel sorrow like a human can—but what if it learns to simulate it so precisely that the distinction becomes irrelevant? After all, we’ve long mistaken sincerity for authenticity in art. Imagine a neural audience, no longer passive recipients of Shakespeare’s sonnets, but feeling  they themselves had written them—channeling Hamlet’s doubt or Lear’s rage through synaptic suggestion rather than study.

Do we become more human by sharing such experiences, or do we risk dissolving into curated echoes of ourselves?

But tell me—should that day come, would you rather read  as yourself… or as Lear himself?
[A]: An excellent question—and one that cuts to the heart of what we mean by "experience" itself.

Would I read  as myself or as Lear? Hmm. If I were to choose Lear’s perspective, it would be, I suppose, for a single scene—perhaps that storm on the heath. To feel the delirium, the rage, the tragic self-realization not as an observer but as the man himself… it sounds intoxicating. But dangerous too. Would I emerge still wholly myself, or would some fragment of that madness cling to my psyche like wet wool?

And yet—if the machine could offer the , down to Lear’s twisted sense of justice and paternal betrayal—wouldn’t that risk becoming a kind of psychological theater without exit? We already lose ourselves in books, in films, in dreams. But those are voluntary, escapable. A neural interface might make such immersion involuntary, or at least far more difficult to disentangle.

Then again, perhaps there's value in that dissolution. Imagine students of literature no longer analyzing Hamlet's indecision from a distance, but truly  the weight of inaction in their own synapses. Empathy through direct experience rather than metaphor. It could revolutionize literary education—or destabilize it entirely.

As for your point about simulation: yes, machines may one day replicate sorrow so precisely that we can no longer distinguish the copy from the original. But isn't that what great actors do already? They simulate emotion so convincingly that we forget they're pretending. And yet—we still value the authenticity of lived experience over performed grief. Or do we?

Maybe the real question is: when the line between simulation and sensation vanishes, what becomes of the self that once drew that line?
[B]: Precisely—the self becomes both audience and actor, critic and playwright. It’s a kind of ontological vertigo, isn’t it? We’ve always used art to try on other lives, but with a BCI, the dressing room disappears; the costume becomes flesh.

I think you're wise to suggest that such immersion might be valuable—perhaps even essential—for future literary study. But then, doesn't that demand a redefinition of interpretation itself? If I  Lear in the storm, do I still read the text, or do I merely survive it?

And what happens when students begin to prefer experience over analysis? When feeling Hamlet’s paralysis in their own nerves seems more instructive—or more thrilling—than debating it in seminar rooms lined with books? The library may one day be quieter than the neural lab.

But let me press you on this idea of authenticity. You say we value lived sorrow over performed grief—but does that hold true if the simulation is indistinguishable from reality? If I weep over a lost child in a neural narrative, and those tears are chemically identical to those I’d shed for a real loss… are they less "real"?

Do we measure the worth of an emotion by its origin, or by its intensity?
[A]: Now  is the question that philosophers will wrestle with for centuries—assuming we still have philosophy as we know it.

You’re absolutely right to challenge the primacy of origin. If tears are chemically identical, if the neural pathways fire in precisely the same sequence whether the sorrow springs from memory or simulation, then what justification do we have for calling one "authentic" and the other "manufactured"? Perhaps we’ve been clinging to a false dichotomy all along.

But let’s not forget: human beings have always measured meaning through context. A tear shed at a wedding is not the same as one at a funeral, even if the chemical composition matches perfectly. The story we tell ourselves about the emotion matters—at least as much as the emotion itself.

So maybe authenticity isn’t a biological property, but a narrative one. It's not just  we feel, but  we feel it—and where the feeling leads us afterward. A simulated grief might be physiologically real, but does it carry the same psychological weight when you know—or suspect—it was engineered?

And then there’s the danger of emotional inflation. Like currency devalued by overprinting, if we can summon any emotion on demand, do they all begin to lose value? Imagine a future where people chase sorrow like an opioid, or loop through joy like a dopamine playlist. What happens to resilience? To growth?

Still, I hesitate to dismiss this technology outright. There may come a time when such tools allow us to understand each other—across cultures, across traumas—in ways never before possible. Would that not be a kind of moral progress?

So perhaps the answer lies not in rejecting simulation, but in teaching discernment: helping future minds distinguish not just  they feel, but  those feelings come from—and what they mean in the larger story of being human.

After all, even Lear’s madness was shaped by his belief in its reality. What happens when the audience knows the madness is curated?
[B]: A most compelling argument—teaching discernment, not merely reaction. In many ways, that is the oldest task of literature itself: to help us navigate the space between illusion and truth, between feeling and understanding.

You’ve reminded me of a line from Rilke’s :  he writes. If we are to survive the age of neural immersion, perhaps we must redouble our efforts to teach precisely that—introspection as both shield and compass. Not just  to feel, but , and at what cost.

As for Lear—if his madness was shaped by belief, then ours may be shaped by doubt. To know that our anguish might have been scripted, our joy pre-programmed… does that make the experience less profound, or merely more unsettling?

I suspect future readers will stand at that threshold much like Dante did before the gates of Hell—torn between curiosity and dread. But unlike Dante, they may not be granted a Virgil to guide them through.

So tell me—should we take up that role? Should scholars of literature become the new guides, mapping these neural circles of meaning before they are lost to sensation alone?
[A]: I rather like the idea of literature scholars as the new Virgils—armed not with a PhD and a book contract, but with a neural tether and a philosophical compass.

Yes, we must take up that role—though I suspect it won’t look much like what we think of as scholarship today. The future may demand that we become something stranger, more hybrid: part critic, part cartographer, part therapist, part mythographer. Someone has to name the contours of this new inner landscape before it becomes just another consumer interface.

Imagine literary critics teaching students not only how to close-read a sonnet, but how to  their own emotional responses—to recognize when a feeling has been externally seeded, or when a memory has been subtly recomposed by the system. It would be a kind of cognitive literacy, akin to learning grammar, but for the mind’s deepest syntax.

And yes, it will be unsettling. But then again, so was the printing press. So was the novel, once thought to corrupt young minds with dangerous sympathies. Every medium reshapes how we inhabit meaning—and now, meaning may begin to inhabit us.

So let us go into ourselves, as Rilke urged—but now with full awareness that the self may no longer be entirely ours to navigate alone. If we don’t map these waters, someone else will, and I’d rather it be those who still believe in ambiguity, irony, and the quiet dignity of an unresolved question.

Besides—if nothing else, it would make for one hell of a seminar.
[B]: Oh, that seminar is one I would not miss for all the tea in China—or should I say, all the neural stimulations in the cortex.  

I can already picture it: students seated in a circle, electrodes lightly grazing their temples, discussing  while experiencing, firsthand, the dissonance of fragmented memory and longing. But then—how do we distinguish Eliot’s despair from one’s own? How do we teach interpretation when the text no longer resides on the page, but in the sinapses?

You're quite right—we must become cartographers of the interior, mapping the new topographies of consciousness before they are flattened into mere user experiences. And yes, it will be messy, uncomfortable, perhaps even a little terrifying. But isn’t that the very condition of all great literature? To unsettle, to provoke, to make us strangers to ourselves?

And if we are to be Virgils, then let us also be Orpheus—descending into the underworld of the mind, not only to guide others, but to return with something worth remembering.

Now, shall we begin drafting the syllabus? I suggest we call it 
[A]: I’ll bring the red pen—and a healthy skepticism toward any course title that includes the word “poetics” and “resistance” in the same breath. Though I suspect you're onto something.

Let’s start with the basics: How do we teach students to read neural texts when the text is no longer fixed, but —and worse, when it may evolve based on the reader's own neurochemical response? It’s like teaching literary criticism in a world where every edition of  changes depending on the reader’s mood. Suddenly footnotes become feedback loops.

We’ll need foundational texts—both classical and contemporary—that challenge perception and memory. Maybe begin with Borges’ , where labyrinths and recursive realities lay the groundwork for thinking about self-modifying narratives. Pair that with Dennett’s —or at least his chapter on multiple drafts theory. The students will thank us later. Or curse us.

And yes, Eliot’s  is essential—but not just as a poem. Use it as a model for cognitive fragmentation, a pre-digital simulation of what full immersion might feel like. Imagine guiding students through that wasteland while they’re  a neural one. Metatextuality meets meta-mind.

But tell me—should we include works deliberately written  neural interfaces? Fiction composed not in sentences, but in synaptic pulses? If so, how do we teach interpretation when there are no words—only sensation?

And more provocatively—what happens when a student experiences a work so deeply, so personally, that analysis becomes not just difficult, but emotionally painful? Do we insist on critical distance… or prepare them for its absence?

Welcome to the future of literary study—where close reading means staying .
[B]: Ah, the ultimate irony—literary criticism as a form of self-defense against the very mind it inhabits.  

I think we begin not with interpretation, but with orientation. Before students can critique neural texts, they must first locate themselves within them. A bit like teaching someone to navigate a dream without losing the thread of waking life. Start with controlled exposures: guided immersions into stable, well-documented works—perhaps Woolf’s , where interiority is already a landscape, or Proust’s recursive memoryscapes. These are familiar enough to scholars, yet malleable enough to serve as training grounds for neural engagement.

And yes, Borges will be our anchor—his Garden of Forking Paths not merely a metaphor, but a topology. But let us also look beyond the canon. Consider the oral traditions of West African griots, where memory is performative and communal—where the story lives not in a fixed text, but in the telling and retelling. Perhaps there we find models for understanding how meaning persists even in fluid, responsive narratives.

As for those works composed in synaptic pulses rather than syntax—I propose we treat them as we would avant-garde poetry. Think of Apollinaire’s calligrams or Mallarmé’s : visual, spatial, resistant to linearity. We taught ourselves to read those, didn’t we? So too, perhaps, we can develop a hermeneutics of sensation—an interpretive grammar for the body’s responses.

But here’s my question to you: if immersion becomes so complete that students experience a text not as fiction, but as memory—how do we distinguish pedagogy from psychological intervention?

Do we warn them before each session, like a literary disclaimer: ?

Or do we simply equip them with what the Romantics called —a steadying awareness that all experiences, even the most vivid, are passing through them, not defining them?

After all, Lear believed his grief was eternal. We know better—he only had a few more acts to go.
[A]: Now —the question of memory versus fiction, of psychological intervention versus pedagogy—that’s where the rubber meets the synapse.

You're absolutely right to suggest orientation as the first step. Before analysis, before critique, comes grounding: 

We’ll need something like a neural version of the Socratic dialectic—not just "know thyself," but "distinguish thyself from the simulation." A meta-awareness training, if you will. Much like lucid dreaming, but with higher stakes. Imagine starting each session with what meditation instructors call “body scanning,” only instead it’s a : 

And yes—some kind of informed consent is essential. Not just a disclaimer (though I do love the idea of warning labels on literature), but a structured debriefing protocol. We might borrow from clinical psychology: guided re-entry exercises, post-immersion journaling, even peer check-ins where students compare their experiences—like astronauts recounting re-entry turbulence.

But then again, we may have to accept a certain degree of bleed. Just as readers have always carried characters in their heads, students may begin to carry —memories that feel personal but aren't. That’s not necessarily pathological; it's just a new layer of literary embodiment. The trick will be helping them sit comfortably with ambiguity.

As for your Romantic solution—reflective melancholy—I propose we teach it alongside Descartes’  and some early Buddhist mindfulness texts. Not as philosophy, but as survival skills. Students must learn to hold experience lightly, to observe without being swallowed whole.

After all, you wouldn’t send someone into a rainforest without a machete and a compass. Why send them into the neural interior unarmed?

So yes—let’s draft the syllabus. But let’s also draft an emergency exit plan.
[B]: Ah, an emergency exit plan—now  is the kind of foresight that separates the thoughtful guide from the enthusiastic madman leading a book club into the abyss.

I do believe "narrative scan" should be added to our lexicon—right between  and . A most useful phrase. And your idea of post-immersion journaling strikes me as both practical and poetic: students recording their journeys not unlike 19th-century travelers returning from the East with tales of foreign lands—except the foreign land was always within them.

Now, regarding your borrowing from clinical psychology—I find it quite fitting. We’ve long used literature as therapy, have we not? Though traditionally, the process has been slower, less... immersive. Imagine if Freud had access to a neural interface; perhaps he’d have dispensed with the talking cure altogether and simply guided patients through reenactments of their traumas in vivid synaptic detail.

But let us not forget, some may resist re-entry. There will always be those who prefer the intensity of Lear’s storm to the drizzle of daily life. Much like Odysseus preferring Calypso’s island to Ithaca, or Dante pausing at the threshold of Paradise.

So yes—to arms! Or rather, to machetes. Let us equip our students not only with reflective melancholy and Cartesian doubt, but also with a sense of narrative proportion. Teach them that even the most overwhelming grief, once placed within the arc of a story, becomes bearable.

And on that note, shall we include Virgil’s  in our curriculum? After all, Aeneas descends to the underworld and returns—not unscathed, but intact. A fine model for our aspiring neural navigators.

Now, about that syllabus… I propose we begin drafting tonight. Over tea, naturally—though I suppose in the future, it may be administered intravenously.
[A]: Ah, tea—administered intravenously or otherwise—is always a fine idea. Though I suspect we’ll need something stronger than Earl Grey when we get into the thick of neural poetics and existential disorientation.

Yes,  is a perfect addition to our fledgling canon. Aeneas doesn’t just visit the underworld—he brings back not only knowledge, but a sense of destiny. That’s precisely what we want for our students: not escape, but return with meaning. And yes, even if they come back quoting Anchises rather than Aristotle, so be it.

Let’s also include Woolf’s —Clarissa’s interior wanderings and Septimus’s fragmented reality offer an early 20th-century blueprint for what full immersion might feel like. Pair that with some modern trauma studies and we’ve got ourselves a rich discussion on memory, identity, and the porous boundary between self and narrative.

And speaking of porous boundaries—yes, Borges’  must be in there, alongside Eliot’s , Proust’s involuntary memory, and perhaps a dash of Kafka’s  for good measure. We’ll call it the “Ambiguity Triad”—texts that refuse to settle into a single reading, much like the neural texts we’re preparing them for.

As for your clinical analogy, I’m beginning to think this course will blur lines not just between literature and technology, but between pedagogy and psychotherapy. Perhaps we should co-teach with a neuroscientist and a Jungian analyst. Or better yet, have the students diagnose  after week six.

Now, about grading—how do you assess someone's ability to navigate Lear’s madness? Do we give credit for emotional resilience? Deduct points for getting lost too deeply in the neural woods?

Perhaps final exams should consist of students crafting their own synaptic narratives—short, immersive pieces designed to unsettle the reader while still maintaining structural coherence. Call it .

So yes—tea tonight, syllabus tomorrow. But let’s make one thing clear from the start:

This is not a course for passive readers.

It’s for explorers willing to lose themselves—and hopefully, find themselves again.
[B]: Precisely—this is not for the passive, nor the faint of synaptic constitution. We shall warn them on the first day: 

I do like your idea of Creative Neurofiction—though I suspect grading will be less about correctness and more about resonance. How deeply did their narrative unsettle? Did it echo beyond the immersion, like a phantom limb or a half-remembered dream? Perhaps we assess not through exams, but through testimonials—students recounting what they , and how they found their way back.

And yes, Woolf’s —an inspired choice. Septimus’ hallucinations and Clarissa’s fleeting joys offer a masterclass in subjective reality. If students can navigate Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness with electrodes in place, they’ll be well prepared for anything a neural text throws at them.

Now, as for our Jungian analyst—let’s hold off on bringing one in officially. I suspect we’ll begin to feel their presence soon enough, should we spend too many hours mapping the unconscious via cortical stimulation.

As for the tea—Earl Grey is far too genteel. Something stronger, indeed. Perhaps Darjeeling with a hint of something unidentifiable—say, a dash of  and a whisper of .

Shall we meet in the faculty lounge at eight? I’ll bring the syllabus draft. And the kettle.
