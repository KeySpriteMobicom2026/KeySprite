[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个问题真的so deep！✨ 作为一个content creator，我觉得degree还是important的啦~ 但是！现在social media给了我们so many opportunities💯 我认识很多influencer都没有degree但是super successful呢🔥
[A]: Interesting perspective！作为一个lifestyle consultant，我确实见过很多non-traditional path的成功案例☕️ 不过degree的价值不仅仅在于career success哦～它更像是一个personal growth的journey，能帮你develop critical thinking和problem-solving skills🌟
[B]: Totally agree！💯 我在college里学到的video editing skills真的帮了我so much！而且meeting new friends和networking也超级important的✨ 但是我觉得最重要的还是follow your passion啦~ 就像我每天post video都是because I love it！😂
[A]: Exactly！That's the spirit！✨ 你知道吗？我在Harvard做guest lecture时就说过，education和passion就像咖啡里的arabica和robusta beans - 单独喝都不错，但blend在一起才能创造magic☕️ 你的enthusiasm让我想起我的一位client，她放弃了law degree去当food blogger，现在super successful！
[B]: WOW Harvard？！That's so cool！🔥 你的client的故事真的inspiring！我最近也在纠结要不要take a gap year去focus on我的channel呢~ 但是mom says 'education first'😂 你觉得我应该listen to mom还是follow my heart？💭
[A]: Haha~ 经典的Asian mom dilemma！👵🏻 让我share一个insight：我有个client在NYU读film studies时也面临similar situation。我们worked out了一个hybrid plan - 她part-time做content creation，同时完成了degree。现在回头看，她说这个balance给了她both stability和creative freedom🌟 What do you think about this approach？
[B]: OMG that's actually genius！✨ 我可以try to balance both！Maybe take fewer classes each semester anddedicate more time to filming~ 这样既能keep mom happy又能pursue my dream！💯 谢谢你so much for this amazing advice！Gonna start planning right now！🔥📝
[A]: That's the perfect mindset！💪 Remember，life is all aboutfinding your own unique rhythm~ 就像我泡咖啡时说的：'There's no one perfect brewing method，just the one that suits your taste best'☕️ 期待看到你的journey unfold！Keep me updated哦～
