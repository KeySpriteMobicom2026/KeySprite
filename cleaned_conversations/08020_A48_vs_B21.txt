[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography... the mechanical cousin of poetry, capturing light where we wrestle with words. Though I must confess my 'technique' remains rather Victorian - I've been experimenting with recreating Julia Margaret Cameron's soft-focus portraits using nothing but an antique brass lens and sheer obstinacy. The results look like ghosts whispering through muslin curtains.
[A]: Interesting approach~ 说到维多利亚时期的摄影技术，让我想起最近在解剖室遇到的一个case。Victorian era的尸检记录其实相当fascinating，他们用的那些primitive forensic photography技术... 📸 虽然画质很模糊，但有时候反而能reveal更多细节呢！
[B]: How delightfully macabre.  Those early forensic plates do share an odd kinship with Browning's dramatic monologues - both forcing us to confront what's half-revealed in the shadows. Though I'd argue the real poetry lies in the marginalia. Did you know Victorian coroners would sometimes annotate autopsy photos with... let's call them 'creative' interpretations of rigor mortis?
[A]: 哈哈，你提到了marginalia！这让我想起上周处理的一个cold case~ 那些老档案边缘的handwritten notes简直比现代digital reports更有价值。有个1889年的案例，法医在照片旁边写着"死者表情异常平静，仿佛在聆听天使的歌声" 👼... 现在我们会用"面部肌肉松弛"这样的专业术语，but sometimes poetry does tell the truth better, right?
[B]: Precisely! You've struck upon why I keep a 19th-century medical dictionary next to my Oxford Book of English Verse. Those florid descriptions - 'the cadaver smiled like a man who'd just solved Keats' Grecian urn' - they're not just antiquated whimsy. They're the trembling point where clinical observation and lyrical imagination... well, shall we say, hold cadaverous hands?
[A]:  Cheers to that! 你知道吗？我最近在整理archive时发现1901年的一份报告，法医把livor mortis描述成"死者皮肤上绽放的暗紫色玫瑰" 🌹... 现代forensic science可能更accurate，但确实少了点... 灵魂？虽然在我们这行，"灵魂"这个词可能会被同事翻白眼就是了 😅
[B]: Ah, but what is science if not the soul's meticulous secretary? Those Edwardian metaphors - the lividity roses, the 'angel-kissed' petechiae - they're doing the same work as Tennyson's 'Nature, red in tooth and claw.' Just with more... measurable hemoglobin levels. Though I suppose my colleagues in the chemistry department already think I annotate autopsy reports with sonnets.
[A]:  说到sonnets... 上周我确实尝试把toxicology report写成十四行诗格式！"Arsenic doth paint the fingernails in gray, While cyanide perfumes the parted lips..." ⚗️ 当然，最后为了court admissibility还是重写了standard version。不过法官看到初稿时的表情绝对priceless 😏
[B]: Marvelous! You've inadvertently created a new genre - forensic Petrarchanism. Though I'd suggest iambic pentameter works better for strychnine than, say, ballads about blood spatter patterns.  Tell me, did you retain the volta where the arsenic turns out to be from wallpaper rather than the scheming nephew? That would make Shakespeare proud.
[A]: 当然保留了plot twist！第三quatrain还特别强调了"the damask tells what tongue would not confess" 🎭 不过说真的，那些Victorian era的wallpaper arsenic cases... 简直比modern crime dramas更dramatic。现在想想，也许我们应该把forensic reports都写成Shakespearean tragedies，至少能保证jurors不会在法庭上睡着 💤
[B]: Capital idea! Though I fear Lady Macbeth's 'Out damned spot' would take on rather too literal meaning in our context. Still, imagine cross-examining a witness in heroic couplets... "When did you last behold thy victim's face?" "Um... Tuesday?" "Aha! The plot doth thicken with thy tardy pace!"  The Old Bailey would never be the same.
[A]:  My Lord, 我提议将整个trial process都改成theater performance！原告律师可以穿Elizabethan ruff，而我们forensic experts就扮演chorus的角色... "Behold the telltale lividity's cruel map!" 🎭 虽然可能被bar association disbar，但至少能保证100% jury engagement！
[B]: Brilliant! We shall call it 'Forensic Revels' - with expert witnesses as the Fates, cutting DNA strands instead of thread. Though I'd insist on playing the Ghost of Toxicology Past, wafting through the gallery whispering 'Remember thee! The half-life of thallium is...'  ...eight days. The appeals process alone would be worth a trilogy.
[A]:  那么就这样决定了！下一季的"CSI: Stratford-upon-Avon"就由我们来produce~ 不过得先说服lab把mass spectrometer改叫"the alchemist's crucible" 🔮 至于DNA evidence... "What light through yonder test tube breaks?" 💉 这可能会让conviction rate下降，但绝对会boost courtroom entertainment value！
[B]: Splendid! Though I must warn you - our closing arguments shall be measured not in minutes, but in acts. And woe betide the prosecutor who dares object during my soliloquy about mitochondrial Eve!  Now, about that arsenic-laced interval tea... purely for historical accuracy, of course. To the Globe... I mean, the lab!
[A]:  To science and sonnets！虽然我们的legal colleagues可能会prefer "to be or not to be guilty"这样更straightforward的版本... 但管他呢，至少我们的autopsy reports会是最poetic的！🍷⚗️ 现在，谁要来扮演Hamlet with the skull... I mean, the cranial specimen?
[B]: Ah, but let us not forget poor Yorick's toxicology screen!  Here's to giving expert testimony that would make Polonius proud - 'brevity be damned, the spleen tells all!' Though I suspect our expert witnesses may develop... unusual performance anxiety. Imagine stammering 'To exonerate or not to exonerate' during cross!
[A]:  "Alas, poor victim! I knew him well... or at least I knew his liver enzymes and gastric contents!" 🎭 说真的，我们这套forensic theater concept说不定能revolutionize legal education~ 虽然可能要先通过ethics committee那一关... 他们可比Claudius难对付多了 😅
[B]: Indeed! Though I propose we bypass the ethics committee entirely and stage our opening night as 'an experimental pedagogical intervention' - with expert witnesses as the groundlings throwing organ specimens instead of rotten fruit.  Just be sure the skulls are plastic this time. The Bard never had to consider biohazard protocols, more's the pity.
