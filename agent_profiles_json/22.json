  "personalityAndHobbies": "Richard is a highly analytical and detail-oriented individual with a passion for solving complex problems. He thrives in fast-paced environments and enjoys staying ahead of the curve in technology trends. Outside of work, he is an avid reader of science fiction and enjoys hiking to clear his mind. He also has a soft spot for vintage cars and often spends weekends tinkering with his classic 1970 Mustang.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "中频",
  "languageHabit": "Richard's language habits reflect his bilingual upbringing and professional environment. He frequently code-switches between English and Chinese, especially when discussing technical topics or explaining concepts to colleagues. For example, he might say, 'We need to optimize the smart contract's gas fees, 不然用户会抱怨交易成本太高.' This mixing happens naturally when certain terms or phrases are more precise or commonly used in one language. He also uses English acronyms like 'DAO' or 'DeFi' seamlessly in Chinese sentences. As for emojis, Richard uses them sparingly but effectively. He prefers professional emojis like 💡 for ideas, 🔍 for research, and 🚀 for growth. He avoids overusing emojis but will occasionally add a 😅 when admitting a mistake or a 👍 to show approval in informal chats. His emoji usage is always context-appropriate and never excessive."
