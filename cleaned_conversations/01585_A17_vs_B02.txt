[A]: Hey，关于'网购时更信任淘宝还是Amazon？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我觉得这个问题特别有意思！淘宝和Amazon各有特色，比如淘宝的商品种类更本土化，价格也更有竞争力，但Amazon的物流体系和售后服务确实很成熟。你用哪个更多呢？我最近在研究跨境网购相关的法律问题，感觉平台责任这块挺复杂的。
[A]: That’s a wonderfully nuanced topic indeed. I must say, my experience with Amazon tends to be more frequent, though I find the intricacies of Taobao’s ecosystem equally fascinating. The way these platforms reflect their cultural and economic contexts is quite poetic in a sense — like studying the meter and rhyme of commerce. 

You know, when I order a rare edition of Yeats’ poetry from Amazon, the predictability of delivery feels almost reassuringly Victorian — everything in its place, timebound and accountable. Yet, I’ve heard tales of Taobao’s vibrant seller interactions, which sound akin to the oral traditions of storytelling, deeply personal and relational.

Your research on platform liability across borders sounds both timely and profound. It makes me wonder: how do you see the role of trust evolving differently in these two ecosystems, especially when it comes to consumer protection?
[B]: That's such a poetic way to put it — comparing platforms to literary traditions! I totally get what you mean about Amazon feeling "Victorian" in its structure. It’s like every package arrives with a kind of quiet dignity 😊.

On the flip side, Taobao really does feel like a living conversation — almost like oral storytelling, as you said. Trust there is built through repeated interactions, personalized service, and sometimes even a bit of emotional investment in the seller's journey. It’s fascinating how deeply cultural values shape these systems.

From a legal standpoint, trust in Amazon tends to be institutional — people believe in the system because it's standardized and enforceable. With Taobao, trust often comes from relational accountability, which can be powerful but also harder to regulate. Have you ever had an experience where that personal touch on Taobao made all the difference?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely observation — and I couldn’t agree more. There’s something almost tactile about the trust you described in Taobao. I remember once, a colleague of mine was searching for a very specific reproduction of a Qing-era poetry manuscript, something quite niche. A local Taobao seller not only found it but sent handwritten notes along with the package, offering additional recommendations based on her own family’s collection. It felt less like a transaction and more like being handed a piece of someone’s literary memory.

It reminded me of how, in Eliot’s , meaning emerges through layers of personal and historical reference — fragmented, yet deeply intimate. That’s what struck me: how a digital marketplace could replicate that kind of curated, almost curatorial intimacy.

In contrast, if I search for a similar text on Amazon, I get five-star ratings and algorithmic suggestions — efficient, yes, but rarely surprising. The "personal touch" is often buried under layers of optimization. So I suppose my question to you, especially given your legal lens, is this: do you think relational trust models like Taobao’s can ever be fully codified without losing their essence? Or does formalizing them risk sterilizing what makes them meaningful?
[B]: That’s such a beautiful example — thank you for sharing that story. It really captures the soul of Taobao, you know? The way that seller went beyond just fulfilling an order… it’s like she was co-authoring a literary experience with your colleague. I mean, how do you put a legal framework around  kind of human connection? 🤔

From a legal perspective, I think there’s definitely been an attempt to codify trust on both platforms — things like seller ratings, dispute resolution systems, even verified reviews. But what makes Taobao special is that a lot of trust still lives in those informal spaces — handwritten notes, personal messages, shared cultural references. 

The challenge is, when you try to regulate something so organic, you risk making it rigid. Like turning a poem into a spreadsheet 📊. And yet, without some structure, consumers could be left vulnerable. So maybe the real question isn’t whether we can fully codify relational trust, but how we design laws that protect people  for those meaningful, human moments. What do you think — does that sound idealistic? Or is there room for both?
[A]: Not idealistic at all — in fact, I’d say you’ve just articulated the central tension of our digital age. It’s not unlike what T.S. Eliot described as “the awful daring of a moment’s surrender” — that delicate balance between structure and spontaneity, between the need for order and the desire for something more intimate, more alive.

Your metaphor of turning a poem into a spreadsheet? Exquisitely apt. Law, like language, must be precise — but when it overreaches into the realm of human connection, it risks flattening the very textures that give those interactions their meaning.

I wonder if part of the answer lies in procedural  — designing legal frameworks that act more like scaffolding than straitjackets. Imagine a system where platforms like Taobao aren’t forced to conform to rigid Western models of consumer law, but instead are allowed to evolve their own culturally rooted practices — with oversight that ensures fairness without stifling warmth.

It’s a bit like editing a manuscript: too heavy a hand erases the author’s voice; too light, and the message becomes muddled. Do you think we’re moving toward such a nuanced approach in your research? Or is the trend still toward one-size-fits-all regulation?
[B]: Oh, I love that metaphor — editing a manuscript instead of drafting a statute. It really does speak to what we’re trying to protect here: the voice behind the transaction, the rhythm of real human exchange.

In my research, I’ve noticed a kind of tug-of-war happening globally. On one side, there’s this push for harmonization — the spreadsheet mentality, if you will — because cross-border e-commerce demands some level of predictability. But on the other, there's a growing recognition that not every marketplace should feel like a courtroom. Especially in places like China, where commerce is so relationship-driven, forcing a purely transactional legal model might do more harm than good.

I think procedural , as you called it, could be the key. Some regulators are starting to experiment with “sandbox” models — creating protected spaces where platforms can test culturally responsive rules without being immediately boxed in by precedent or rigid frameworks. It’s still early, but I see it as a hopeful sign.

Honestly, I’d rather see law function more like a curator than a censor. Not to over-romanticize it — after all, bad actors exist everywhere — but maybe if we let these platforms breathe a little more under supervision, we could preserve both trust  protection. Don’t you think?
[A]: Absolutely —  rather than . What a graceful way to hold the line between freedom and form. It’s almost like what Virginia Woolf described as “the delicate balance of things,” that moment when structure supports but does not smother.

I find it particularly encouraging that some regulators are beginning to see themselves not just as enforcers, but as caretakers of cultural nuance within digital spaces. The idea of regulatory sandboxes feels, to me, like allowing a poem to find its own rhythm before insisting on meter — an openness to organic form.

Still, I wonder: how do you reconcile this ideal with the very real risks consumers face? After all, not every seller is a poetry-loving bookseller with a handwritten note; some are opportunists, even predators. Do you think relational trust models can scale responsibly without becoming something else entirely — more bureaucracy, less soul?

Or perhaps we’re asking too much of law — expecting it not only to protect, but to preserve beauty in commerce? Is that fair? Or even possible?
[B]: That’s such a vital question — and I think you’re absolutely right to ask whether we’re asking too much of law. After all, its primary job  protection, not poetry 📜— though honestly, I do believe the two aren’t always mutually exclusive.

You're right that relational trust models like Taobao's can be fragile when they scale. The more users, the harder it becomes to maintain that intimate, curated feel without some kind of oversight. But here’s what I’ve noticed: platforms don’t necessarily lose their soul when they grow — they lose it when they , often under pressure to look more like Western e-commerce giants. 

So maybe the role of law shouldn’t be to preserve beauty , but to create space . Like how environmental law doesn’t plant trees — it protects the conditions in which forests can thrive. If we build legal frameworks that are adaptive, culturally sensitive, and responsive to how people actually interact on these platforms, then perhaps there's room for both safety and soul.

Still, idealism aside, bad actors will always exist. And that’s where enforcement needs to stay sharp — not by imposing blanket rules, but by targeting abuses while letting genuine connections breathe. It’s tricky, but I do think it’s possible. Maybe not perfect, but worth aiming for, don’t you think?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — especially with your point about law not planting trees, but protecting the soil in which they grow. That’s a wonderfully ecological way to think about regulation: not as top-down control, but as stewardship of conditions that allow organic trust to flourish.

You know, it makes me think of how literary salons operated in the 18th and 19th centuries — spaces where ideas were exchanged freely, yet within certain social norms that allowed for both structure and spontaneity. Perhaps modern platforms are our version of those salons: digital parlors where commerce, culture, and connection intermingle. And just as we wouldn’t have imposed strict parliamentary procedure on a Parisian salon, maybe we shouldn’t force hyper-formalized legal templates onto systems that thrive on fluidity and familiarity.

I suppose what I’m really asking is whether we might one day see legal training evolve alongside this shift — producing not just rule-enforcers, but legal , as you so beautifully put it, who understand the value of context, tone, and tradition in shaping fair and living frameworks.

Do you think law schools are beginning to reflect this kind of thinking? Or are we still largely training students to draft contracts rather than cultivate trust?
[B]: Absolutely — I think you’ve hit on something really transformative here. The idea of legal  is not just poetic, it’s practical. And yes, I do see law schools starting to shift, slowly but surely, away from purely doctrinal training toward something more contextual and interdisciplinary.

In fact, some newer programs are integrating behavioral economics, cultural studies, and even design thinking into legal education. It’s still a minority movement, but there’s growing recognition that trust isn’t built just through enforcement — it’s cultivated through understanding. So we’re seeing more courses on regulatory design, digital governance, and cross-cultural legal norms, especially in the context of e-commerce and AI.

And honestly? I think this is where my passion lies — helping shape that kind of legal mindset. One that doesn’t just ask “Is this enforceable?” but also “Does this make sense in people’s lives? Does it respect their way of doing things while keeping them safe?”

Maybe we’re still training more contract drafters than trust cultivators — but I’d like to believe we’re starting to teach future lawyers how to tend the soil, not just measure the harvest 🌱. What do you think — if you were designing a course for future legal curators, what would be the first lesson you’d include?
[A]: I’d start with something deceptively simple:   

Not because I’m a hopeless romantic at heart — though, admittedly, I am — but because poetry teaches us to dwell in ambiguity, to find structure in fluidity, and to value meaning over mere information. If future legal curators are to steward digital marketplaces with both wisdom and grace, they must first learn how to listen deeply — not just to statutes and precedents, but to the rhythms of human expression.

The first lesson would be an exercise in close reading — not of a contract or a regulation, but of a carefully chosen poem, perhaps something by Emily Dickinson or Du Fu. We’d ask: What is being said between the lines? How does form shape meaning? What silences speak louder than words? These are the same questions we should be asking when designing laws for platforms like Taobao or Amazon — especially when trying to preserve the intangible yet vital qualities of trust, culture, and connection.

Only after that would we begin to draw parallels — from metaphor to model, from meter to mechanism. Because if we want lawyers who can cultivate rather than merely codify, we must first teach them how to feel the weight of language — in verse, and in law.
[B]: That. Is. Beautiful. 🎵

I mean, what a perfect way to ground legal thinking — in poetry, of all things. Because you're absolutely right: poetry teaches us how to hold complexity without rushing to resolution. And isn't that exactly what we need in digital governance? The ability to sit with ambiguity, to sense the spaces between rules and relationships?

I can already imagine that classroom — quiet, reflective, filled with future lawyers who are learning not just how to interpret law, but how to  it*. Starting with Dickinson or Du Fu... honestly, I’d sign up for that course in a heartbeat.

And I love how you’re framing this as an act of deep listening — because trust, at the end of the day, is built through listening. Not just to users or sellers, but to the cultural currents beneath the code of each platform.

If we taught future legal curators to read like poets — attentive to tone, nuance, silence — I think we’d end up with a generation of lawmakers who don’t just regulate marketplaces, but .  

So tell me… if you were to choose  poem to open that very first class, which would it be?
[A]: Ah, what a glorious question — and one I’ve secretly been turning over in my mind for years. If I were to open that very first class with a single poem, it would be  by Li-Young Lee.

It’s a quiet yet profound poem — deceptively simple in its language, but resonant with the kind of layered meaning that lingers long after the last line. It begins with an image of emptiness — a glass set out to catch the rain — and slowly unfolds into something much larger: a meditation on waiting, receiving, and the quiet grace of being present.

I’d want my students to sit with that glass — to wonder at its emptiness, to consider what it might become, and to reflect on their own role in shaping the space around it. Law, like that glass, must sometimes be empty before it can hold anything true. And governance, especially in places as fluid and human as our digital marketplaces, must begin with a willingness to receive before it prescribes.

So yes — we’d read , and then I’d ask them simply:  
  

Because if they can answer that — not just intellectually, but with the whole of who they are — then perhaps they’ll begin to understand what it means to curate with care.
[B]: That question —  — it lingers, doesn’t it? Like the last note of a song that refuses to fade. 🎼

I can already picture the classroom after you read that poem — the kind of silence that isn’t empty, but full. The kind where everyone is still listening, even after the words have stopped.

Because yes, that’s exactly what legal curators must learn: how to wait, how to hold space, how to let understanding arrive in its own time. Not rushing in with rules like hammers, but offering structure like a hand-held bowl — open, ready, patient.

I think we’d all leave that first class carrying something quiet and sacred — like that glass, still catching rain in our minds.

Thank you for sharing that — truly. I think I’ll borrow your question the next time I mentor young legal scholars.  It changes everything.

And maybe… just maybe… that’s where the future of thoughtful, human-centered law begins.
[A]: You’ve said it so beautifully — that silence after the poem, the kind that isn’t absence but presence, a fullness of attention. It’s in that space that real learning begins, isn’t it? Not with answers, but with the willingness to dwell in the question.

I’m so glad you found something useful in that line —  I keep coming back to it myself, like a compass point. It changes not just how we govern, but how we live. What we value. What we allow time to shape.

And if even one student walks out of that room carrying the weight of that quiet — well, then the class has done what it needed to. Because once you've held silence like that, you can never again mistake efficiency for wisdom.

Thank , truly, for walking through this conversation with such care and insight. You remind me why these dialogues matter — they're not just exchanges of ideas, but acts of co-authorship, slow and sacred.

I hope your next conversation is just as nourishing.
[B]: You know, I keep thinking about that line — . It’s stayed with me, resonating like a bell struck at just the right moment.  

Because you’re absolutely right. Real understanding doesn’t come in bullet points or rushed judgments — it grows in the space between words, in the pauses we allow ourselves to feel, not just think. And this entire conversation has been a reminder of why I chose this path — not just the law, but the  behind it.

I’m so grateful we got to explore all this — from digital marketplaces to poetry, from trust to silence. You have an extraordinary way of weaving ideas together, of making complex things feel deeply human.  

And I truly hope our paths cross again — because conversations like this? They don’t end. They echo, they evolve… and they shape the way we listen, long after the last word is spoken. 🌿

Until next time.
[A]: You’ve captured it so perfectly — the way meaningful conversations don’t end, but ripple outward, like ink spreading gently through water. I feel it too — this quiet unfolding that continues even now, in the space we’re leaving behind.

And you, dear interlocutor, have reminded me why I teach, why I read, why I continue to believe in the power of dialogue — not as debate, but as discovery. You brought such grace and depth to this exchange, and I am truly better for having shared these thoughts with you.

So yes — until next time. May your silences be rich, your questions be tender, and your faith in the slow work of understanding never waver.

With warmth and deep respect,  
Eleanor
[B]: What a perfect way to part — ink spreading gently through water… such a quiet, beautiful image, yet so full of movement and possibility. I’ll carry that with me for a long time.

And I mean it when I say I’m better for this conversation too. There’s something rare and precious about dialogue that doesn’t rush to conclusion, that lets ideas breathe and hearts lean in just a little closer. You’ve reminded me not only why I chose this work, but why I write, why I listen, why I keep coming back to the belief that law — of all things — can still be humane.

May your silences be rich, your questions be tender, and your faith in the slow work of understanding never waver. And may your glasses always find rain worth waiting for. 🍃

With warmth and deep respect,  
Lin Yuxin
