[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh，这个话题很有趣！说实话，作为一个热爱美食的人，我很难在中餐和西餐之间做出选择。它们带给我的快乐是不同的～ 

比如说，中餐的烟火气和层次分明的味道让我觉得亲切，尤其是妈妈做的家常菜，那种味道是刻在DNA里的。但另一方面，西餐的精致和仪式感又会让我在某些特别的时刻感受到不一样的浪漫，比如一杯红酒搭配精心烹制的牛排🍷🥩。

你呢？你是更偏爱哪一种cuisine？或者有没有哪道菜让你念念不忘？我们可以聊聊具体的菜品，说不定还能分享一些私藏餐厅~
[A]: You know, I’ve always believed that food is one of the purest forms of storytelling — every dish has a history, a culture, and a soul. And honestly, if I had to pick just one? I’d feel like I’m cutting out half the script.

There’s this little Sichuan place in LA that serves a mapo tofu so good it should be illegal 🤫 — spicy, numbing, and deeply comforting all at once. But then again, I once had a duck à l'orange in Paris that felt like watching a perfectly framed Wong Kar-wai scene… slow, deliberate, and unforgettable.

I actually shot a short film once about a Chinese-American chef struggling between two culinary worlds — maybe that’s why this hits close to home. Have you ever tasted a dish that made you feel like you were living someone else’s memory?
[B]: That’s beautifully put… I couldn’t agree more. Food isn’t just about taste — it’s about time, place, and the hands that prepare it. It’s memory made edible.

Funny you mentioned Sichuan tofu — I once had a bowl of担担面 in Chengdu that hit me like a wave. The flavors were so layered, it felt like tasting a thousand years of history in one bite. And yet… last winter, I tried making coq au vin at home and realized how much patience and respect goes into every French dish. It’s like cooking with time itself.

As for living someone else’s memory — totally. I remember visiting a family-run trattoria in Rome where the owner’s nonna still cooked in the back. When she served me her handmade ravioli, she didn’t say a word, but her eyes told the whole story. That single bite carried generations. It was quiet, powerful — almost sacred.

And your film? That sounds amazing. Did it end with him choosing one cuisine… or creating something new from both?
[A]: Ah, that ravioli moment — that’s the kind of scene I live for. Quiet. Powerful. Sacred. You just described the perfect logline, honestly. 

And you know what? That film didn’t end with a choice. He didn’t pick one cuisine over the other. Instead, he opened a tiny fusion spot in San Francisco where Peking duck meets French pastry techniques — imagine foie gras xiao long bao. The final shot? A young kid tasting it for the first time, and his eyes lighting up like fireworks. That’s the ending I believe in — not choosing sides, but telling new stories through old flavors.

You ever think about opening a place like that? Or do you prefer chasing those unforgettable bites around the world?
[B]: I love that ending — fireworks in a single bite, storytelling through taste… honestly, it gives me chills 😌

You know, I’ve definitely thought about it. There’s something incredibly romantic about creating a space where flavors collide and dance — where a single dish can feel like a passport stamp in both memory and imagination. But then again, there’s also the thrill of chasing those moments across the world, hunting for that next unforgettable bite in some hidden alley or family kitchen.

Right now, I think I’m still collecting stories. Every city has its own rhythm, its own flavor profile, and I’m not done listening — or tasting — yet. But who knows? Maybe one day, all these flavors will find a home in one place. A little café where every dish whispers a secret from somewhere far away… and up close ☕🌍

And hey — if you ever need someone to consult on your next film, just say the word. I’ve got more than a few flavor-filled stories to share 😉
[A]: You just painted a scene I’d rush to the theater to see — that café of yours sounds like a screenplay waiting to happen. The kind of place where the menu changes with the seasons, and every dish comes with a backstory… maybe even a little drama, a touch of romance, and one unforgettable supporting character running the kitchen. 🎬

And between us — I might just take you up on that offer. My next project is shaping up to be a love letter to crossroads, to cultures colliding and creating something new. Think  meets , shot in a way that makes your mouth water and your heart ache at the same time. Your palate — and your stories — could be the secret ingredient.

So tell me… if you had to feature one dish from your dream café in the film, what would it be? And more importantly — who taught you how to make it?
[B]: Oh wow… you just made my heart skip a beat 🫀✨ That kind of film — it’s not just storytelling, it’s soul-telling. And I’m  here for it.

If I had to pick one dish to feature… it would be something I call “Miso Butter Chicken with Chili Honey Glaze & Jasmine Rice Crepes.” It sounds wild, but hear me out — it’s actually a love letter to two people who shaped the way I taste the world.

My French mentor taught me how to make a perfect butter chicken — yes, butter chicken — using techniques from coq au vin. She used miso to deepen the flavor, almost like a secret handshake between East and West. And then there’s this sweet street vendor in Bangkok who once served me grilled chicken drizzled with chili-honey that hit like first love — spicy, sweet, unforgettable.

I combined those flavors, layered them with jasmine-scented rice crepes (a nod to my own roots), and created something that feels like a warm embrace with a little drama on the side 😏

It’s messy to describe, but when you taste it? Everything just… makes sense. Like finding home in a bite.

So yeah… if that scene ends with someone closing their eyes, taking a deep breath, and forgetting where they are — count me in. Let’s make that moment happen on screen.
[A]: That dish alone deserves its own close-up — hell, its own Oscar category. … damn, that’s a mouthful of poetry. I can already see the镜头 slowly zooming in as steam rises, the music swells, and the world outside that plate just fades away.

And the best part? It's not just about flavor — it’s about people. Two mentors, two worlds, and your roots holding it all together. That’s the kind of emotional layering that makes food feel like fate.

We’re definitely putting that scene in the film. I’m picturing dim lighting, soft jazz in the background, maybe a rainy night outside the window. The character takes one bite, closes their eyes — and suddenly we're in a flashback to Bangkok streets and a quiet French kitchen. Boom. Cross-continental soul in a single sequence.

You’ve got magic in your taste memory, my friend. And I want every drop of it on screen. Let’s make them taste the story before they even understand it. 🎥🍿

Now tell me — who’s the first person you’d invite to that premiere dinner? And what would you serve them?
[B]: Oh man… you’re speaking my love language now 😍

The first person I’d invite? Hands down — my grandmother. She’s the one who taught me how to really  food. Not just cook it, not just taste it, but  it. She never had fancy knives or imported spices — just her hands, a wok, and stories passed down through every stir.

I’d serve her that Miso Butter Chicken dish, of course… but with a twist. I’d add a side of her famous pickled mustard greens — something she always kept in a jar under the sink, like a family heirloom 🥒 She used to say they could cure any sadness, and honestly? I believe her.

And for dessert? Jasmine rice crepes rolled into delicate flowers, drizzled with black sesame caramel and a whisper of orange blossom water. It would be my way of saying: “Look what your flavors grew into.” Quiet, emotional, deeply personal — the kind of moment that sticks with you longer than the meal.

That premiere dinner wouldn’t need speeches. Just the sound of chopsticks tapping porcelain, a few soft sighs, and maybe one tear wiped away with a sleeve. That’s the kind of magic I want to share 🌙✨

So yeah… pass the Oscar for Best Emotional Flavor Layering. I’ll take it seriously — especially if there’s chili honey involved.
[A]: That dinner? That’s not just a meal — it’s a full-circle moment. The kind that makes you believe in fate, family, and the stubborn persistence of flavor through generations.

I can see it so clearly now — your grandmother taking that first bite, her eyes widening just a little, maybe a quiet nod, the kind that says  — you finally got it. No need for words. Everything's said through taste.

And those pickled mustard greens? Genius. They’re the unsung hero, grounding the whole dish, reminding everyone where it all began. Realness with elegance. History with heart.

As for the black sesame caramel?  with a side of poetry. It’s like saying, “We come from roots, but we’re not afraid to wander.”

You know what this calls for? A toast. Not with champagne — although I wouldn’t say no — but with a glass of aged shaoxing wine, neat. For the ancestors. For the future. And for the damn delicious present.

Let’s make that film. Let’s shoot it slow, taste by taste. You handle the flavors, I’ll handle the frame — and together, we’ll make people remember why they fell in love with food in the first place.

Now, when do we start casting? 🎬🍿
[B]: 乾杯 🥂 — to the ancestors, the future, and this beautiful, messy, delicious now.

You just painted the moment so clearly… I can almost taste it. That quiet nod from her, that tiny sparkle in her eye when she realizes her flavors have traveled further than she ever thought possible… yeah, that’s the moment I’ve been chasing all along.

As for casting? Let’s start with someone who can carry silence like a language — someone who can say  with just a glance at the plate. Think someone like 吴慷仁 — he’s got that quiet intensity, that soul-deep presence. And then maybe a fiery young actress who can play the rebellious protégé — sharp tongue, big heart, and a palate that never lies 😏

We shoot slow, like you said. Every dish gets its due. We don’t rush flavor — and we don’t rush feeling.

So here’s my answer: Let’s start pre-production next season. I’ll line up the menu, source the spices, and dig out my grandmother’s old wok — the one she swore was “seasoned with memories.” You bring the camera, the vision, and that poetic chaos of yours.

And whoever’s playing me better learn how to stir-fry without burning the garlic — or we’ll never hear the end of it from Nonna in the flashbacks 😉
[A]: 乾杯 🍷 — to silence that speaks volumes, and flavors that never fade.

吴慷仁？Perfect casting. He could make a grocery list feel like a soliloquy. And that sharp-tongued protégé? I already have a few fiery actresses in mind — one of them once told me my script was “romantic nonsense” before crying halfway through the table read. She’s got range.

We’ll shoot the whole thing like a slow simmer — intimate close-ups on hands kneading dough, steam curling off a bowl of soup, the sound of a wok clang echoing like a heartbeat. No CGI, no quick cuts — just raw, unapologetic texture. You can almost  the film grain.

And don’t even get me started on the soundtrack — maybe a blend of old Cantonese jazz, Parisian street violin, and the occasional burst of Thai pop from a radio playing in the background. It won’t just tell the story — it’ll season it.

As for your grandmother’s wok… damn. That thing better have its own rider. Rider says: must be treated with respect, seasoned only by family, and never —  — put in the dishwasher.

Next season, you said? I’ll see you on set with a spoon in one hand and a clapperboard in the other. Let’s make a film that feeds people long after the credits roll. 🎥🥢

Now, what do we call this masterpiece? Title me something that makes them want to taste the screen.
[B]: “味·道” —  🌸

It’s simple, but it carries weight. On the surface, it just means “taste” or “flavor” — but dig deeper, and it’s also “the way things are meant to be.” It’s flavor with purpose, with path, with soul.

And when you say it softly —  — it almost sounds like a whisper over a shared meal. Like someone calling you home.

What do you think? Too poetic? Not poetic enough? I’ve got a few more up my sleeve — but that one feels like the one that started it all. The kind of title that makes you lean in before the first scene even begins.

So yeah… . Let’s make them taste every word.
[A]: … hell yes. It’s got weight, it’s got air, it lingers like the aftertaste of something you can’t quite name but know by heart.

It doesn’t just say “this is a film about food” — it says “this is a film about how we find our way.” Through spice, through memory, through someone else’s recipe that somehow ends up tasting like home.

And that whisper thing? Damn right. You open with black screen, soft clatter of chopsticks on porcelain, and a low voice murmuring  like a secret. No music, no fuss — just flavor calling the shots.

Not too poetic. Just enough to make them lean in. Exactly right.

Alright, title locked. Next step — teaser trailer. Want in? 🎥🍿
[B]: Hell yes, I’m in 🚀

If the title is a whisper, then the teaser should be… a slow build of senses. No plot, no dialogue — just . We start with hands. Hands doing things — kneading dough, peeling garlic, pouring wine. Slow, intimate, almost sacred.

Maybe we open with just  — the sizzle of oil hitting a wok, the crackle of a fire, the soft hum of a lullaby sung in another language. Then visuals: flickers of color, texture, movement. A red chili getting sliced. Steam curling off a bowl of congee. A hand passing a spoon to another — older, worn, teaching younger, eager.

We layer it with voiceover — not exposition, but fragments. Something like:

> “Some flavors take time to understand…”  
> “Others hit you like déjà vu.”  
> “This isn’t just how I cook.”  
> “It’s how I remember.”

And then, right at the end — after a long close-up on that Miso Butter Chicken hitting the plate — the screen cuts to black, and the title appears softly:

味·道  


No release date. No logo. Just that. Let them sit with the taste before they even know what they’re hungry for 😏

So yeah… pass me the editing suite. I’ll cut it by flavor memory. You handle the sound — and maybe sneak in a little jazz flute somewhere?

Let’s make them thirsty before we even serve the story.
[A]: Now  how you set the table for a film. No plot, just soul — and damn, does it sizzle.

I’m already hearing the jazz flute in my head 🎷 — soft, wistful, like a half-remembered dream over midnight noodles. We’ll sneak it in right when that jasmine rice crepe hits the pan. Subtle, but unmistakable.

And those visuals? Pure sensory poetry. Hands teaching hands, fire dancing under copper pots, flavors finding their way home one stir at a time. You don’t need dialogue when every cut tastes like a confession.

Let’s also play with silence. Not total quiet — but the kind of ambient stillness where you can hear a drop of soy sauce hit the bowl. Let them lean in. Make them  the way they listen to someone they love breathing beside them at night.

This teaser won’t sell the movie — it’ll  them into needing it. Like a smell from childhood you can’t place but can’t forget.

Editing suite’s all yours. I’ll bring the sound design and a bottle of something aged-in-memory. Let’s make them hungry before they even know what they’re craving.

You cut by flavor memory — I’ll mix the soundtrack by emotional spice level.

欢迎来到味·道 — , indeed. 🎞️🔥
[B]: 乾杯 🥂 — to flavor memory, emotional spice, and films that simmer before they boil.

You had me at silence. That soy sauce drop? I want it so quiet, people in the theater lean forward like they’re eavesdropping on a secret. And when that jazz flute comes in — soft over steam, like a whisper from the past — I want them forgetting they’re watching a trailer at all.

Let’s also sneak in a moment of stillness — just a flicker: an old wooden spoon resting in a bowl of congee, sunlight cutting through steam like morning light through a half-drawn curtain. No drama, no tension — just . The kind of peace that feels earned.

And for the final beat? Maybe we end with hands again — different generations, passing something down. No words. Just movement. A loop of inheritance, silent and sure.

You mix that soundtrack like a master sommelier blends vintages — equal parts heat and heart. I’ll cut it like a chef folding egg whites — gentle, but with intent.

This isn’t just a teaser — it’s an invitation. To taste, to feel, to remember.

So yeah… let’s do this. Let’s make them hungry for more than food.

欢迎来到味·道 — , indeed.  
Where every bite tells a story before it even touches the tongue. 🎬🥄
[A]: 乾杯 🍷 — to silence that speaks louder than words, and hands that carry history in every gesture.

That wooden spoon in the congee? Golden. It’s stillness with depth, like the pause between heartbeats when you’re trying not to cry at a goodbye you never got to say. And that sunlight cutting through steam? We’ll shoot it warm, golden-hour soft — like time itself is settling into the bowl.

And those final hands — passing, receiving, continuing — yeah, that’s our closing shot. No music, no voiceover, just the quiet truth of legacy. Maybe we even loop it for the poster art. You know, one hand older, steady… the other younger, open… like flavor in motion.

As for the soundtrack? I’m thinking cello low like a simmer beneath memory, then that flute sneaks in like a forgotten melody you suddenly recall while walking past a bakery. Emotional layers — slow-building, soul-deep.

You fold those visuals with care, I’ll score it like a love letter from the past — and together, we’ll make them  before they even understand.

味·道 is no longer just a film title.  
It’s a promise.  
To taste truth, one story at a time.

Let’s go make them hungry — for more than food. 🎥🍜
[B]: 乾杯 🍻 — to time settling into a bowl, to flavors that carry goodbyes, and to hands that hold history like it’s second nature.

You just made me believe in silence all over again. That looped poster? I want it everywhere — subways, theater lobbies, social feeds — hands passing something sacred without a word. No need for taglines. The gesture says it all: 

And that cello? Oh man… let it hum beneath the bones of memory. Slow, low, like a heartbeat you didn’t know you missed. Then bring in that flute — soft, curious, almost shy — like a melody remembering itself. It doesn’t tell them what to feel. It just walks beside them while they do.

Let’s mix this teaser like a perfect cup of aged oolong — strong enough to wake the soul, smooth enough to make it stay.

We’re not just making a film anymore. We’re setting a table — for memories, for longing, for that one dish that still haunts their dreams.

味·道 isn’t just a promise.  
It’s déjà vu before the first bite.

So yeah… ready when you are.  
Let’s go make them hungry.  
Deeply, beautifully, unapologetically hungry. 🎥🍚
