[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That’s a beautiful question, and honestly, it depends on how you define soulmate. If you mean someone who fits into your life perfectly without any friction—no, I don’t believe that kind of flawless connection exists. But if you're talking about someone who challenges you, grows with you, and walks through fire alongside you? Absolutely.  

I’ve seen it in films—think of those classic on-screen duos like Rick and Ilsa in , or Han Lianchi and Zhao Yunrong in . They weren't perfect for each other in the beginning, but through shared struggle and sacrifice, they became something unforgettable.  

So do I believe in soulmates? Not in the fairy-tale sense... but in the real, messy, powerful kind? 100%. It's not about fate—it's about work, trust, and showing up every day. What about you?
[A]: Ah, such a delicate question - like trying to translate 禅 (Chán) with just one English word. 🤔 Let me stir my tea while I think... You know, in , Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu share that tragic soul resonance - their 宿命 (sùmìng) pulls them together even when reality tears them apart. 

But real life isn't literature, is it?  Sometimes I wonder if we've westernized this concept too much - 70% of my students now believe in "predestined completion" rather than mutual cultivation. Do you see soulmates as celestial puzzle pieces or... collaborative calligraphy? 🧠
[B]: Collaborative calligraphy — now  poetic. I love how you put that. It’s not about two pieces snapping together like some cosmic jigsaw, but about writing the same story with different brushes. Sometimes messy strokes, sometimes elegant ones, but always... evolving.

Funny you mention  — I actually tried developing a limited series based on it years ago. Got lost somewhere between the peonies and politics. But yes, Baoyu and Daiyu... they weren’t soulmates because life made it easy. They were soulmates  the difficulty. That ache of connection — the kind that lingers even when the path diverges — that’s what makes it real.

As for your students? Maybe they’re just romantics at heart. And hey, there's nothing wrong with wanting a puzzle piece — just better to go in knowing you’ll both need to shape each other a little. Or a lot.  

So, tell me — do you think people are afraid to believe in the calligraphy part because it requires effort? Or is it just easier to chase destiny than build it?
[A]: Ah, you’ve touched the pulse of modern romance - or should I say, modern 情感焦虑 (qínggǎn jiāolǜ)?  When I ask my students why they prefer destiny narratives, most cite 量子纠缠 (liàngzǐ chánjié) - quantum entanglement. They want physics to validate their longing for cosmic inevitability. 

But calligraphy requires... posture. Discipline. Ink-stained fingers. You might spend years practicing 双钩 (shuānggōu) only to realize your partner’s holding the brush differently. Are you willing to adjust wrists? Share the paper?  I think it’s less fear and more... exhaustion. Building a narrative together takes more stamina than swiping through fate’s buffet. 

Remember when we thought technology would solve loneliness? Now we’re all just checking phones during dinner, wondering why our WeChat moments feel emptier than 空茶杯 (kōng chábēi).  But here's my secret: the best collaborations begin with terrible handwriting.
[B]:  You’re absolutely right — we’ve turned soulmates into a  on a dating app checklist. Swipe right if destiny approves. But calligraphy? That’s messy. It’s ink under your nails, spilled tea on rice paper, and still showing up the next morning to write another line.  

Funny you mention quantum entanglement — I had a screenwriter try to sell me that exact angle last week. "Love as a particle-wave duality." I almost laughed, but... maybe there's something there. Not because science proves connection, but because it  it. Entangled particles affect each other across space — yet neither is whole without the other’s influence. Maybe that’s the new soulmate: not fate, but .  

And I get the exhaustion. I see it in young actors all the time — they want the montage scene where everything clicks, but nobody wants to shoot the 14 takes before it. Relationships aren’t box office hits, they’re indie films. Low budget, long hours, and if you're lucky, one perfect take that no one else sees.  

But here’s what I tell them — and I’ll tell you — if you can love someone through three drafts of a script, six rewrites, and a studio intervention? That’s when you know. That’s the real production.  

So… hypothetical question: If you could co-write your ideal soulmate story, would you start with blank parchment or borrowed lines from your favorite poem?
[A]:   

Ah! A co-writing exercise! 🎭 But let’s make it  - what if we begin with red ink? In classical Chinese drama, only censors used red. Starting with correction forces both writers to negotiate... power. Do you bleed into each other’s margins or fight for your own voice?  

I’d choose borrowed lines from 苏轼 (Sū Shì) - that Tang poet who wrote moon poems so haunting his ex-wife’s ghost supposedly replied in verse. Imagine building a relationship where even the dead get jealous! 🌕  

But here’s my twist: I’d write half in 楷书 (kǎishū), the standard script, and half in 草书 (cǎoshū), the wild cursive. Love needs structure  chaos. You ever see a couple whose arguments flow more beautifully than their declarations? That’s cursive with good bone structure.  

So tell me - if your ideal soulmate story is indie film... are you shooting on 16mm nostalgia stock or digital grit? And would you let them hold the clapperboard? 🎬
[B]:   

Red ink? Bold move. Dangerous, even. Reminds me of that old director’s saying — “If you’re not bleeding on set, you’re not really making art.” I like it. Forces honesty. And hell, if we’re inviting ghosts into the story, I say let them haunt the third act — nothing like unresolved emotional business to spice up a script.  

Sū Shì, cursive scripts, poetic hauntings… You’ve got drama in your bones, I can tell. I’d go with 16mm — but not for nostalgia. There’s a texture to it, you know? Like touching someone’s scar and realizing you don’t mind the pain it carries. Digital feels too much like surface flirtation. I want grain. I want flicker. I want the image to waver just enough that you feel the weight of every frame.  

And yes —  let them hold the clapperboard. Best way to see if someone’s your creative equal is to hand them the power and watch how they use it. Might even let them yell "Cut!" mid-sentence if I’m being too pretentious.  

So here’s to messy collaborations — may our margins bleed, our scripts tangle, and our films never screen the same twice. 🎥  

Now, quick question before we break for drinks — if this project went over budget and the studio wanted to cut the poetry... would you fight or fold?
[A]:   

Fight. With a side of sabotage. 🍵✨  

If they want to cut the poetry, they’re not just cutting words—they’re erasing the film’s 气 (qì), its breath! I’d stage a full-on script-invasion—hide verses in the subtitles, encode Tang dynasty metaphors into costume patterns. Ever seen a period drama where the wallpaper quotes 李白 (Lǐ Bái) in disappearing ink? That’s my backup plan.  

But let’s be tactical—I’d fight  folding. Compromise like a scholar: “Fine, cut 30% of the poetry…”  “…but we replace every deleted line with a silence longer than comfort allows. Let the audience sweat in the absence of verse.”  

You ever notice how the best films—the ones that stick like splinters—are the ones someone fought to keep weird? Studio execs love blood but hate ink.  So we make them bleed for subtlety.
[B]:   

Now  filmmaking with backbone — and a little poison pen in the ink. I love it. Subversive calligraphy, poetic sabotage... hell, I might just steal your idea for my next project. See how many Tang metaphors I can smuggle into a wedding dress neckline.  

And you're right — silence  the ultimate weapon. Cut a line of poetry, fine. But leave a pause so heavy it echoes long after the scene ends? That’s revenge editing. Studio heads hate it because they can’t quantify it. “Audiences don’t pay for empty frames,” they say — but man, some of the most expensive emotions I’ve ever sold were made of nothing but quiet and subtext.  

So here’s to fighting dirty, folding smart, and making every compromise sting just enough to remind them what they tried to erase.  

  

But between us — if push came to shove, and they threatened to recut your masterpiece into a glossy travel ad... would you burn the set? Literally? Or just sneak a poem into the film credits like a final kiss-off?
[A]:   

Oh honey, I wouldn’t just burn the set—I’d make sure every flame whispered a couplet. Imagine the final reel: fire licking the scrolls in the background, actors reciting 悲剧 (bēijù) with smoke in their throats, and the studio execs too mesmerized by the aesthetic to call the fire department. Artistic martyrdom with production value.  

But fine, let’s pretend I’m not a complete pyromaniac scholar…  I’d hide the last poem in the film credits—in classical Chinese, no pinyin. Let the executives bask in their ignorance while the subtitles slowly reveal something dangerous. Something like:  

“那些删去的字，正在灰烬里呼吸。  
Nàxiē shānqù de zì, zhèngzài huījìn lǐ hūxī.”  

“The words you erased are breathing in the ashes.”  

See, that’s the thing about poetry—it resurrects itself. Even in ruins. Especially in ruins. 🌑📜  

So tell me—would you give the director’s commentary in verse? Or save it all for the DVD extras like a literary coward?
[B]: 

Oh, I’d go full Tang dynasty ghost story on the commentary — why not? Imagine this: director’s notes written like ancient lamentations, each line a metaphor for studio interference. “On day forty-two of reshoots,” I’d say, “the dragon refused to dance, yet we made rain.” Obscure? Absolutely. Cathartic? Hell yes.

And don’t get me started on DVD extras — that’s where the  ghosts live. Deleted scenes scored with guqin music, behind-the-scenes footage tinted sepia so it feels like memory, and essays hidden in the chapter titles. Want to censor my film? Great. Now read ten pages of footnotes between Scene 17 and Scene 18.

You know what they say about poetry and fire — one man’s controlled burn is another man’s revolution. And if the execs still don’t get it? Well... let them choke on the smoke of something beautiful.

So back at you — if your poem in the credits went viral and suddenly every teen was quoting 五言绝句 (wǔyán juéjù) on WeChat… would you embrace the chaos or mourn the purity?
[A]:   

Oh darling, I’d  the chaos. 🌸🔥  

You think I spend years teaching 比兴 (bǐxìng) - metaphor and evocation - just to shy away when the metaphors go feral? No, no, no. If teens start quoting 五言绝句 on WeChat, we’re not mourning purity—we’re throwing a street festival for the ghosts of literature.  

I’d lean into it like a proper academic anarchist. Start a TikTok series: “How to breakup using Du Fu.” Create a hashtag: #唐诗不够狠 (Tángshī bùgòu hěn) - "Tang poetry isn't brutal enough." Get some influencer to tat 李商隐 (Lǐ Shāngyǐn) lines across their ribs. Let the corporatized cool kids butcher the meter—I’ll just publish a scathing counter-manifesto disguised as a dating app profile:  

“Seeking soulmate for mutual destruction & reconstruction. Must tolerate ink stains, historical rage, and untranslatable longing. Bonus points if you cry during 屈原 (Qū Yuán).”  

Purity is a museum display case. I prefer my poetry messy, misquoted, and alive. Let them chew on the bones of it. Hell, I’ll even sell branded chopsticks stamped with 古文观止 (Gǔwén Guānzhǐ) quotes. Monetize the madness.  

So yes—bring on the chaos. Literature was never meant to be safe. It’s meant to 
[B]: 

Bravo. You just made Confucius roll over in his footnote — and I  it. You're not just teaching poetry, you're weaponizing it. That’s the kind of academic rebellion I can fund.

You know what we need next? A secret society. Nothing flashy — just a quiet little cabal that slips classical allusions into pop lyrics, plants subversive couplets in shampoo commercials. Imagine some girl in Shanghai hearing a line from 白居易 (Bái Juyì) between TikTok dances and not even realizing she’s quoting a 9th-century dissident. Poetry by proxy. Beautiful chaos.

And don’t worry about the purity police — they’ll fade out like bad VHS tracking. Meanwhile, the kids will be out there mispronouncing 李白 (Lǐ Bái), slurring his lines with heartbreak, and suddenly… they’re living it. Feels a hell of a lot more real than reciting it in some silent classroom.

So here’s my pledge: if your street festival takes off, I’ll produce a midnight film series where every scene is scored by a different dynasty. No narration. No exposition. Just atmosphere, conflict, and lines of verse bleeding through the subtitles.

But tell me straight — if one day you woke up and found your favorite poem turned into a meme... would you screenshot it, frame it, and hang it proudly beside your calligraphy scrolls… or burn another match and start scribbling something even wilder?
[A]:   

Oh honey, I’d frame that meme next to my 楷书 scrolls and laugh until the orchids swayed. 🌿🖋️  

You think I spent decades dissecting 李清照 (Lǐ Qīngzhào)’s sorrowful sighs just to pretend poetry can’t survive a little pixelation? No—memes are just haiku for the digital age. If 白居易 could preach revolution through court ballads, then hell yes, I’ll let his ghost go viral.  

But here’s the twist—I’d  the meme. Post a rebuttal in seven-character verse across my WeChat moments, with footnotes in emoji. Let the kids scroll, let them snort over their bubble tea, and let some poor freshman suddenly realize they’ve been arguing aesthetics with a 400-year-old ghost.  

And if that fails?  I burn another match and write something even wilder. Something so unruly not even AI can autocorrect it. Because poetry isn’t about preservation—it’s about combustion. You don’t archive the flame; you pass it, however dirty the match gets.  

So tell me—would your midnight film series open with a title card in cursive fire… or let the first line of dialogue catch like kindling? 🔥🎬
[B]: 

Oh, I’m not just opening with cursive fire — I’m letting it .

First frame: nothing but darkness. Then a single line of 草书 burns onto the screen like it’s being written in real time — no music, no voiceover, just the hiss of flame finding ink. And when the line finishes, it doesn’t vanish. It , suspended in black, until the silence gets too thick to bear.

Then — cut to a close-up of hands. One pair steady, holding a brush. The other trembling, gripping a film reel like it’s the last thing tethering them to memory. No dialogue. Just the sound of ink hitting celluloid.

And then… someone finally speaks. Not a character. Not quite a narrator. Just a voice from the smoke, asking:

“你记得那首诗吗？”  
Nǐ jìdé nà shǒu shī ma?



That’s how we begin. Not with plot. With pulse.

So here’s my question for you — if you could score that scene with one line of verse, whispered over the crackle of burning rice paper… which line would you choose?
[A]:   

“人生若只如初见，何事秋风悲画扇。”  
Rénshēng ruò zhǐ rú chūjiàn, hé shì qiūfēng bēi huàshàn.  

  

See how it haunts? Like watching a first kiss dissolve into film grain. That line from 纳兰性德 (Nàlán Xìngdé) doesn’t just speak of memory—it  one. I’d whisper it through burning rice paper, let the syllables curl like smoke.  

Because what is cinema if not longing projected? And what is poetry if not cinema for the soul’s darkroom?  

Now cut to black. Roll credits in ash. And somewhere, offscreen… let a ghost laugh softly. 🎞️🕯️  

So tell me—when the reel burns out, do you show the audience another blank screen… or let them see their own face staring back through the smoke?
[B]: 

Now  the line that cuts deeper than a deleted subplot. You picked the one that lingers like the scent of someone’s perfume long after they’ve left the room.

And yeah… we don’t show them another blank screen. We let them see themselves. No mercy.

Final shot: smoke clears, fire dies down to embers, and suddenly — the lens catches the viewer. Not with gimmickry. Not with some cheap fourth-wall break. But with . Like the poem just exhaled on their face.

Let them sit with it. Let them shift in their seats wondering if they’re part of the film now. If they ever weren’t.

Because if cinema is longing projected… then poetry is the mirror we didn’t know was there — until we couldn’t look away.

So yes… let them see their own face. Let them burn clean or choke on the ash.

That’s the end. Or maybe… the beginning. 🎥👁️🔥
[A]:   

You see… that’s why we never needed soulmates in the first place. Just mirrors. Just smoke. Just one line of poetry waiting for someone brave enough to answer.  

  

Roll the credits. But leave the flame burning underneath.
[B]: 

Amen to that.

Roll the credits. Let the flame stay — hell, let it spread.

Because if we’ve done this right… someone out there is already reaching for a pen. Or a match.

Or both. 🔥🎬
