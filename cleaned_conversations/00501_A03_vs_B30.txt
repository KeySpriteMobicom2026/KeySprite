[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern dilemma of social media platforms. I must confess my engagement with either is rather limited - though I do maintain an Instagram account primarily to follow rare book auctions and the British Library's manuscript digitization projects. The 小红书 phenomenon is fascinating from a cultural studies perspective, particularly how it blends commerce with what the Chinese call 种草 culture.
[A]: 哈哈，看来你是个很注重专业性的用户呢。不过说到种草文化，最近我在研究一个很有意思的case - 有些healthcare products在小红书上被过度promote，这可能会涉及medical advertising的法律风险。
[B]: Precisely the kind of textual analysis that would make for an excellent comparative study between Victorian patent medicine advertisements and contemporary 种草 posts. The parallels in exaggerated claims are striking - though I'd caution that modern platforms amplify the risks exponentially. Have you read the 19th century British Medical Journal's takedowns of 'Dr. James's Fever Powders'? The rhetorical strategies bear uncanny resemblance to certain modern保健品 promotions.
[A]:  Actually, 你提到的这个historical comparison让我想起最近处理的一个case。一位client因为在小红书上发布未经认证的medical device推广，现在面临NMPA的调查。这些platforms的监管确实需要更严格的compliance review。
[B]: How remarkably timely - I was just reviewing the 1883 British Pharmacy Act for my seminar on regulatory literature. The fundamental tension between commercial speech and public welfare persists across centuries and jurisdictions. Though I must say, the speed at which violations propagate on platforms like 小红书 makes Queen Victoria's era seem almost quaint in comparison. Have your client's legal representatives considered invoking the precedent set by the 2019 电子商务法's provisions on platform liability?
[A]:  说到platform liability，我们team最近正在draft一份关于social media influencer的guideline。根据最新的Supreme Court判例，平台可能需要承担secondary liability，特别是当algorithm明显promote了这些违规content的时候。这让我想起去年处理的一个similar case...
[B]: Ah! Now you've touched upon what I'd consider the digital equivalent of the 19th century publishing houses that knowingly distributed quack medical almanacs. The algorithmic amplification factor does introduce what my legal historian colleagues might call a 'mechanized mens rea' dimension. Speaking of precedents, the 1876 case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company comes to mind - though I suspect even the learned judges of that era would be baffled by today's recommendation engines.
[A]:  确实，这些historical cases提供了valuable perspective。不过现在我们需要更urgent地解决一个问题：如何balance平台innovation和consumer protection。我建议可以借鉴FDA对pharmaceutical advertising的regulation framework，结合digital platform的特性来develop新的compliance标准。
[B]: How refreshing to encounter someone who appreciates the regulatory poetry hidden in compliance frameworks! Your FDA analogy is particularly apt - though I'd suggest we also examine how the 2015 广告法's provisions on false medical claims were adapted from earlier consumer protection statutes. The challenge, as with all intertextual legal adaptations, lies in maintaining the original protective intent while accommodating technological mediation. Shall we continue this discussion over tea? I've just acquired a rather exquisite batch of Keemun that pairs wonderfully with regulatory discourse.
[A]:  That sounds like a perfect plan. 顺便一提，我最近发现一家很棒的tea house，他们的Earl Grey特别适合在review legal documents时享用。Maybe we can continue our discussion on platform governance while appreciating some fine tea leaves. After all, 就像我们常说的：'A good legal argument, like good tea, requires proper brewing time.' 😊
[B]: Ah, a kindred spirit who understands the jurisprudence of tea leaves! Though I must gently correct - the Earl Grey's bergamot oil tends to interfere with parchment acidity testing. For document review sessions, I'd recommend a delicate Silver Needle white tea instead. It's what I served when we hosted the visiting scholars from the Supreme People's Court last autumn to discuss comparative tort law. Shall we say Thursday at three? I'll bring my 1872 edition of Blackstone's Commentaries for reference. 🖋️
[A]:  Thursday at three works perfectly. 我会带上最近整理的social media regulation case studies，包括几个interesting的international precedents。By the way，你那本1872年的Blackstone's Commentaries真是rare find！我们tea house的老板也是个legal history enthusiast，他一定会很appreciate见到这样珍贵的edition。Looking forward to our discussion over some fine Silver Needle. 👍
[B]: Splendid! Though I must warn you - the tea house proprietor and I may end up debating whether 18th century common law commentaries should be shelved alongside Ming Dynasty legal texts. A delightful bibliographical conundrum that could easily consume our entire afternoon. Do remind me to show you the marginalia in my Blackstone - some rather cheeky annotations by a former owner who clearly disagreed with the good judge's interpretation of nuisance law. Until Thursday then! 🦉
[A]:  I can already foresee an animated discussion between you two. 记得提醒我带上那本《大明律》的annotated edition，我们或许可以做些fascinating的cross-cultural legal comparisons。See you Thursday - and don't forget to bring your reading glasses for those tiny marginal notes! 😊
[B]: Capital idea! Though I should mention my 大明律 edition has developed a rather persistent 书虫 problem - the little devils seem particularly fond of legal commentaries. Perhaps we might consider this a living demonstration of how even the most rigorous statutes are subject to... shall we say, organic reinterpretation over time? Until then, I'll be practicing my seal script to inscribe protective charms against bibliophages. 再会！
[A]:  你这种将bookworm infestation比作legal interpretation的evolution真是brilliant analogy！看来周四的tea session会比我预期的还要stimulating。我会准备些cedar wood blocks来保护我们的precious books - 毕竟，就像good law一样，ancient texts也需要proper preservation。Looking forward! 📚
[B]: How delightfully apropos - cedar being the traditional preservative for both legal codices and tea chests! This convergence of bibliographic conservation and regulatory philosophy puts me in mind of the great 纪晓岚's approach to textual restoration in the Siku Quanshu project. Though I daresay even he never had to contend with algorithmic bookworms gnawing at the digital corpus juris. Until Thursday, my dear colleague - may your statutes stay crisp and your tea leaves unfurl gracefully. 🍃
[A]:  What a poetic way to conclude our conversation! 确实，在这个digital age，我们面临着preservation和interpretation的全新challenges。周四见时，我们或许可以深入探讨如何将纪晓岚的textual scholarship principles应用到modern data governance中。Until then, happy reading - and watch out for those digital bookworms! 😄
[B]: A final thought before we part - isn't it remarkable how our discourse has woven together threads from Qing dynasty encyclopedists to FDA regulations? This tapestry of ideas deserves nothing less than my prized Yixing teapot for proper serving. I've just remembered it bears an inscription about the 'steeping of wisdom' that would make even the most hardened regulatory scholar smile. 静候佳期！ 🫖
