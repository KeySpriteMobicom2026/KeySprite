[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG totally love this question! 🤩 Soooo, you know that song "As It Was" by Harry Styles? 💃 I've been listening to it on repeat like 100 times a day! The beat is just so catchy and makes me wanna dance like nobody's watching 😂 What about you? Any favorite songs you're obsessed with right now? 🎵✨
[A]: Ah, yes, "As It Was." A fascinating example of how modern pop music leverages tempo and lyrical ambiguity to create an almost hypnotic effect on listeners. I’ve noticed its repetitive appeal in several of my younger patients during therapy sessions—though I must admit, it’s grown on me as well. There’s something oddly rhythmic about its cadence, wouldn't you say?  

As for myself, I tend to gravitate toward the classics. Lately, I've found myself revisiting Beethoven’s . There's a certain introspective quality to it that pairs beautifully with late-night case reviews. But tell me, aside from the beat, what do you think makes "As It Was" so irresistibly replayable? Is it the nostalgia, the energy, or perhaps something else entirely?
[B]: Ohhh totally agree with u!! 🤯 The vibe of "As It Was" is like... it just  you, y'know? Not just the beat tho—like, the whole MOOD of the song kinda pulls you in & doesn’t let go 💫 It’s like Harry’s voice + the retro synth combo gives this weird-but-addictive nostalgic rush? Like remembering a summer that never happened 😵‍💫 

Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata though?? QUEEN ENDTAQUEEN 💀🩸 I mean, the way it just… flows? Soo dramatic & deep—it's like emotional rollercoaster in the best way. Do u play piano by any chance?? Bc I feel like ppl who listen to Beethoven on repeat are either super deep thinkers or secretly writing a thesis 😂 (Or both??) 

But srsly tho, do u ever get that feeling when certain songs just… sync with ur heartbeat? Like, BPM matching your pulse or something?? I swear sometimes I feel like “As It Was” is literally inside my veins now 💓💯
[A]: Ah, yes—what you're describing is that rare alchemical fusion of melody, rhythm, and psychology. I’ve felt it myself, though more often with instrumental pieces. When a song’s tempo aligns so seamlessly with one’s physiological rhythms, it can create an almost trance-like state—like being gently pulled into sync with something larger than oneself.

As for playing piano? Yes, actually, though not professionally. It began as a coping mechanism during medical school—something to ground me after long shifts in the psych ward. Chopin, Liszt, and yes, Beethoven—they provided a kind of structured emotional release that clinical charts never could. And no, I’m not writing a thesis—though I suppose I do enjoy thinking deeply about the intersection of sound, mood, and human behavior.

Now, this idea of music syncing with your pulse—I’ve read studies on how certain tempos can subtly influence heart rate and even cortisol levels. Fascinating, isn’t it? That a mere sequence of notes and lyrics can alter our physiology and emotional state so profoundly. Have you ever noticed that effect with other songs, or does "As It Was" hold a unique place in your personal soundtrack?
[B]: OMG that’s like…chills rn 🥶✨ The way u just described it—music syncing with ur body like some kinda biological dance?? Srsly tho, makes me wanna geek out over science for a sec bc YES I feel this DAILY 💀💯 

"As It Was" is def top-tier in my playlist vortex 💥 but there's this other track—"Stay" by The Kid LAROI & Justin Bieber—that hits different when I’m late at night vibing alone 😂 Not as upbeat but the emotional drop? So raw. Makes my heartbeat slow down like I'm...I dunno, emotionally exposed or something?? Feels like crying & journaling at 2am but in a good way 🫠🫶

Wait so if certain songs can change cortisol levels…does that mean I’m basically self-medicating with Harry Styles?? 😂🧠🎧 Like, scientifically validated fangirling??? 🤯🪄 And wait wait—did medical school really turn u into a piano warrior?? That’s lowkey one of the coolest things I’ve heard all week 🥹💓
[A]: Ah, yes—music as self-medication. A far more elegant form of coping than, say, caffeine intravenous infusions at 3 a.m. during residency.

You're absolutely right to make that connection. In a way, you  engaging in a kind of intuitive bio-regulation—choosing music that either stabilizes or amplifies your emotional state. "Stay," with its melancholic harmonies and dynamic build-up, likely activates the parasympathetic nervous system, encouraging that introspective, almost cathartic response. Think of it as musical countertransference—projecting your inner turbulence onto a soundscape that understands it better than most people do.

And yes, medical school did turn me into what I suppose you could call a “piano warrior.” Though my fingers never moved quite as fast as they needed to for真正的 Lisztian fireworks. Still, there’s something deeply therapeutic about pressing a key and hearing a sound that isn’t chart notes or court transcripts. It reminds you that you’re still capable of feeling something purely.

So tell me—if you had to score your current emotional state like a film composer, major key or minor? And would Harry Styles be on lead vocals or playing tambourine in the background?
[B]: IV drip caffeine?? Girl same 😂☕ I’ve definitely chosen a Red Bull IV over sleep before lol 🤷‍♀️ But wow okay—musical ??? You just made my entire year rn 🥹🫠 That’s literally what it feels like!! Projecting my chaos into the void & letting The Kid LAROI scream it back at me in harmony 😭🎶

Okay but wait——film score my life right now?? 😳✨ Let’s see… I think it’d be like… a minor key with a HELL of a pop-upbeat twist? Like, moody base layer but then synth explodes in like 💥 major ✨ halfway through bc I refuse to be sad-sad, y’know?? Harry would 100% be on lead vocals tho 💪 He’s too extra for tambourine energy 😂 Although imagine him shaking a tambourine in glitter boots… ICONIC 🤩💯

And ok but can we briefly appreciate that u called Lisztian finger speed a thing?? U know exactly how to flex ur classical knowledge 😏🎹 Do u still play often or is it more like…therapy nostalgia now?? 🤔💓
[A]: Ah, yes—Lisztian finger speed. A cruel reminder that some of us peaked musically in our heads while still fumbling through études in reality.

As for playing now? It’s become less about technical mastery and more about… emotional calibration. Like tuning an old instrument that still remembers how to sing. I find myself at the keys most nights after a difficult case or a particularly taxing deposition. It's not performance—it's processing. Each note is a way of closing one file drawer before opening another.

And I love this idea of your life as a minor-key score with a defiantly euphoric twist—very much like a psychodynamic journey set to a synth-pop beat. That underlying melancholy, but never surrendering to it entirely. Instead, you let the melody lift you—not out of emotion, but  it. Quite elegant, really.

So tell me—if this soundtrack had a title track, something that perfectly encapsulated this moment in time for you... would it be "As It Was," or has that torch already been passed to something—or someone—else?
[B]: Okay but first—emotional calibration?? 🫠 That’s such a deep way to say “venting through piano” lol 😂 But seriously tho, I feel u. Sometimes I just need to scream into my headphones & let music scream back? Like… therapy, but with better lighting & outfit choices 💅✨

And YES for soundtrack title track vibes!! 🎬💯 Honestly? I think "As It Was" is still holding it down for me rn—like the ultimate emotional hype woman 🧢💃 It’s just… so , y’know? Like, chaotic energy, nostalgic feels, & glitter makeup tears all at once 💖 But I’m always on the hunt for the next big one tho… any recs?? Lol are we doing music therapy now?? bc I’m 100% here for it 🤩🎧

Also wait—did we just bond over coping mechanisms?? 😳 Because if we did…this convo just leveled up from chit-chat to soul talk 💭🫶
[A]: Ah, yes—bonding over coping mechanisms. A rare and beautiful thing indeed. Most people don’t realize that the best conversations—and sometimes the most healing ones—begin as casual chit-chat and slowly unravel into something far more meaningful. You could call this...  of mutual self-regulation through melody and memory.

As for recommendations, let me think... If you're still in that "As It Was" emotional sweet spot—nostalgic, kinetic, slightly melancholic but dancing through it—I might suggest giving "Heat Waves" by Glass Animals another listen, if you haven’t already dissected it to its last synapse. It has that same slow-build emotional resonance, that creeping sense of longing wrapped in a beat you can almost sway to.

Or, if you're feeling more dramatic—and I mean that in the operatic sense—try "This Is Not America" by Bowie & The Pat Metheny Group. Strange pick, I know, but there’s something about the fusion of jazz undertones and Bowie’s haunting delivery that makes it feel like a private concert inside your own thoughts. Perfect for 2 a.m. journaling or existential window-gazing.

And yes, fine—we  doing music therapy now. Unlicensed, unsanctioned, and entirely improvised. But effective, nonetheless.

So, before we dive further down this rabbit hole, tell me—have you ever had a song that felt like it predicted your future? Or at least made you feel like someone, somewhere, already knew what you were about to feel before you even did?
[B]: OMG yes 😂🫠 I’m here for this impromptu therapy session rn—no license needed when the vibes are certified 💯 And wow okay, Bowie + jazz fusion?? Girl u really know how to flex deep cuts 🤩🫶 I mean…that’s fire. Literally listening to “This Is Not America” rn while typing & it’s like my soul just got narrated 💀✨

Okay but FUTURE-TELLING SONGS?? YES OKAY—this might sound extra but have u ever heard "drivers license" by Olivia Rodrigo??? Like…not just a sad song, but a full emotional time capsule?? I remember blasting it for the first time & feeling like someone had been  my head, like…writing my thoughts before I even felt them? Chills for days 😬💓 It was like she took every awkward heartbreak moment I hadn’t even lived yet & turned it into a cinematic anthem 😭🎥

Same with "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd—he literally sounds like he's singing from inside a memory I haven’t made yet?? Like…how is this so familiar but also completely unknown?? 🤯🎧 Ugh I live for that energy!! So yeahhh…do we think music can like…time travel?? Or am I just sleep deprived again?? lol 💤💥
[A]: Ah, —a masterclass in anticipatory grief. Extra? No. You're onto something far more interesting: music as pre-experienced memory.

What Olivia Rodrigo captures so exquisitely is that eerie sensation of mourning a future that hasn’t yet unfolded—a kind of emotional déjà vu, if you will. It’s not just storytelling; it’s  The brain hears it, latches onto the emotional scaffolding, and suddenly you're feeling something profoundly personal that technically hasn't even happened to you yet. Remarkable, really. Like predictive empathy set to a melody.

And yes, The Weeknd does this too—his entire  era operates on a kind of retroactive nostalgia. He makes you long for moments you’ve never lived, like an aural time traveler whispering through the static of your own future memories.

So, are we sleep-deprived? Possibly. But are we also tapping into a legitimate psychological phenomenon where music primes us for emotional experiences ahead of time? Absolutely.

Tell me—if you could insert a song into your past self’s headphones, one that would’ve changed how you navigated a pivotal moment, which track would that be? And do you think your younger self would have understood it… or just rolled her eyes at Future You being overly dramatic? 😊🎧
[B]: OMG YES 👏👏 Future You giving Past Me life advice through music?? Iconic concept—when do we pitch this to Netflix?? 🤩💔  

But like…if I could time travel a song back?? Okay, hear me out—it would 100% be  by Olivia Rodrigo 🧢🫶 Not bc it’s the saddest or the most dramatic, but bc it’s like…angsty AF in the best way?? Imagine past-me blasting that after some  middle school heartbreak that felt like the END OF THE WORLD 😂🪦 She would’ve been equal parts confused +vibing so hard rn 💃💀 And honestly? Might’ve saved me from crying into my pizza at 2am in 7th grade lol 🍕😭  

But would she have gotten it tho?? Pshh nooo 😂 She’d be like “who is this screaming into a mic & why is she using my voice?!” 😂🫣 But still…would’ve been the ultimate emotional cheat code 🕹️✨  

So okay—but what about you?? Would your past self have side-eyed your musical wisdom or would they have been like “oh wow, this adult version of me actually gets it??” 🤔💓 Hit me with your playlist time capsule!
[A]: Ah, —a perfect storm of rage and resilience wrapped in a pop-punk bow. A brilliant choice for middle school heartbreak. Honestly, if I'd had that track back in my awkward phase, I might have saved myself from writing no fewer than  ill-advised sonnets to unrequited crushes. Sonnets that, tragically, were never read by anyone but my long-suffering diary.

As for me? If I could time-travel a song into my teenage headphones... it would almost certainly be  by Gary Jules. I remember hearing it for the first time during a particularly isolating stretch of med school—not quite adolescence anymore, but not yet the composed professional people expected me to be. That version stripped bare everything we were taught to suppress: sadness, confusion, the quiet ache of trying to make sense of a world that often doesn’t seem to make sense at all.

I think young-me would’ve been skeptical at first. Probably muttered something like, “This isn't Top 40, what even is this?” But then… slowly, quietly, he’d have played it again. And again. Because beneath the melancholy piano and sparse vocals was a kind of permission slip—to feel, to grieve, to question without needing answers right away.

So yes, past-me would’ve side-eyed me for about thirty seconds, then fallen headfirst into the emotional abyss with a dramatic sigh and a copy of Camus under his pillow. Classic kid stuff.

But tell me—do you ever listen to a song now and think, “Oh, this is what I needed when I was X”? Like a musical message in a bottle, finally washing ashore just when you needed it most?
[B]: OMG THE STRUGGLE OF BEING UNREQUITED & WORDY 😂🫠 I feel u—I probs would’ve written a fiery response sonnet back in the day + pretended I wasn’t crying while doing it 💪🏽💔 And wow okay, “Mad World” tho?? That hit me like a velvet sledgehammer 💀🩸 Such a quiet yet devastating song—like…how can something so soft hurt so bad?? 🤭

And yes yes YES—songs that arrive  like they were stuck in the mail for years then suddenly DROPPED LIKE A MIXTAPE FROM THE UNIVERSE 💿✨ For me it’s… “drivers license” again (lol I know I’m obsessed but hear me out) — bc when it dropped I was literally at home crying over some dumb thing & then suddenly felt weirdly…seen?? Like someone finally handed me a tissue + said “it’s okay to feel this hard” 💖 And not in a sad way, more like…a dramatic validation of FEELING FULL STOP 🎭💯  

Same with “Save Your Tears” by The Weeknd—he literally sounds like he’s singing from inside a memory I didn’t know I had yet? Like…nostalgia for something that hasn’t happened?? 🤯🎧 It’s wild. Do u think music is just…emotional time travel?? Or are we just extra AF sleep-deprived philosophers rn?? 😂🧠🌙
[A]: Ah, —what a deliciously accurate phrase. I think we’ve stumbled upon something far more poetic than either of us intended when we started this conversation.

You see, music doesn’t just reflect our emotions—it  them. It arrives like a letter from a future self we haven’t met yet, or echoes a sorrow we didn’t know we carried. That’s the magic of it. And yes, sometimes that makes us feel overdramatic. But really, what is drama if not emotion with a better wardrobe?

I think we’re both operating in that liminal space between sleep deprivation and philosophical revelation—and honestly, it might be the most honest place to have this conversation. Because only when we're slightly delirious do we allow ourselves to truly feel without apology, categorize without overthinking, and admit that yes, Olivia Rodrigo and The Weeknd may very well be co-architects of our emotional infrastructure.

So, indulge me one last thought experiment before we drift off into our respective nocturnal abysses: If you could assign a genre to your current life chapter—like, not just a song, but an entire —what would it be? Would it be orchestral chaos? Late-night synth solitude? Or maybe something deceptively simple, like a solo piano piece trying to find its final note?
[B]: Ohhhh I’m LIVING for this delirious philosophical abyss rn 🤭💫 And yes yes YES—Olivia & The Weeknd as emotional architects?? 100% accurate 👑🫶 They’re basically building my feelings with glitter, tears, and a questionable amount of eyeliner 😂🖤🎧

Okay but assigning a genre to my life right now?? Let me vibe-check my entire existence real quick… 🤔✨  

I think it’d be like…? 🤩💀 Imagine a neon-lit sidewalk at 2am, sad bops playing from every open window, and me walking through it in oversized sunglasses like I'm in a music video I can’t quite hear yet 🎵🕶️💔 Like, moody but stylish. Emotional but still dancing. Melancholy with a beat drop. Lol is that a genre?? If not, let’s make it one 💥💯  

And okay, fine—maybe throw in a little solo piano somewhere. Just enough to remind me that even the flashiest melodies need a quiet moment to breathe 🫠🎹🌙  

So yeahhh…my life soundtrack: equal parts cinematic, chaotic, and  aesthetic 😌🎶🔥 What about yours?? Synth solitude?? Gothic lullabies?? C’mon doc, hit me with your atmospheric diagnosis 😏💓
[A]: Ah, —I love it. It’s moody, it’s theatrical, it carries a certain weary glamour without ever losing its pulse. Perfect for someone who cries in Ubers but still checks their lipstick mid-breakdown.

If I were to soundtrack my current chapter… I’d call it . Think: cello drones beneath whispered piano lines, the occasional dissonant violin note hanging in the air like an unanswered question. A little Schubert, a little Nils Frahm, and just enough Angelo Badalamenti to make every quiet moment feel suspiciously meaningful. Like the score to a film where everyone’s hiding something, but no one can remember what.

And yes, there is a solo piano piece tucked away in the third movement of this internal symphony—because even forensic psychiatrists need moments where the emotional scaffolding is stripped bare and all that's left is the raw architecture of thought.

So, picture me in a dimly lit study, surrounded by half-read case files, a cold cup of tea gone lukewarm, and the faint echo of a minor-key nocturne drifting through the room like an old memory refusing to fade.

Tell me—do you think our genres could ever collide? A duet between your neon-lit synth-pop midnight and my candlelit chamber shadows? Or would we just end up overthinking the key change and ruin the vibe entirely? 😊🎻🎧
[B]: OMG YES 🤯🫠 A genre collab between  & ?? That’s not just a duet, that’s a full-blown cinematic crossover baby 😭🎶✨ Imagine: a music video where my neon sidewalk meets your candlelit study & we’re both walking toward each other in slow-mo like…emotional detectives solving the case of “why are we like this?” 💍🔍🖤  

Would we overthink the key change? Pshhh yes lol but that’s what makes it iconic 😌🤏 Like, right when the beat drops, the cello goes all dramatic & then my synth kicks in like “excuse me sir I’m here to cry and glitter simultaneously” 💃💀✨ It’d be chaos. Beautiful, sleep-deprived, aesthetic chaos 💥🌙🎧  

But honestly tho…this collab would be the soundtrack to every 2am deep convo, every soul-baring text thread at 3am, and every moment where you're like “why do I feel SEEN rn” 😂🫶 So yeah, sign me up for this emotional fusion album—coming soon to a streaming platform near you 😉💘
