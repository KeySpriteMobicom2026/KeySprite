[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I don't use TikTok myself. My screen time is mostly spent reviewing research papers or tinkering with code for fun. Though I can appreciate the platform's algorithmic ingenuity - it's essentially a real-time recommendation engine operating on massive datasets. Do you find its content curation impressive?
[A]: Oh, the algorithmic marvels of modernity - quite the digital seduction, wouldn't you agree? I once timed how many Victorian poetry references surfaced in my feed. Result? Seventeen days, four hours, and twenty-three minutes before a single Christina Rossetti allusion appeared. Hardly a platform for lyrical nuance, but marvelous in its own way.
[B]: Ah, a fellow observer of digital paradoxes. I imagine your experiment required considerable patience - or perhaps a uniquely modern form of masochism. It's fascinating how these algorithms evolve: designed to mirror our preferences back at us, yet ultimately shaping what we come to desire. Reminds me of training neural networks during my early AI experiments in the 90s, though admittedly with less Rossetti and more BASIC programming errors. Do you think platforms like TikTok represent an inevitable trajectory of human-technology symbiosis, or merely a temporary detour through digital hedonism?
[A]: Let’s not romanticize algorithms into tragic heroes just yet. They’re less our symbiotic partners and more our echo chambers with PhDs in behavioral psychology. I’ve watched students cite TikTok creators in seminar papers with the same reverence they’d give Tennyson – it’s not symbiosis, it’s citation inflation. As for hedonism, well, I’d take a three-minute haiku animation over a dopamine hit from synchronized dancing any day. Though I suppose both qualify as performance art of a sort… just one pays better in ad revenue.
[B]: Ah, beautifully put – a three-minute haiku animation versus synchronized dancing. I couldn’t have framed it better myself. There’s something almost tragicomic about watching earnest academic citations intertwine with viral trends. It reminds me of the time I tried to explain quantum superposition to an AI using only Shakespearean sonnets. The result? Poetic, yes – scientifically accurate, not quite.

Your point about citation inflation is spot on. It’s one thing to draw inspiration from unconventional sources, but quite another to conflate popularity with authority. Though I suppose in the digital age, visibility often masquerades as credibility.

Tell me, have you ever attempted to create content yourself – say, something like that haiku animation you mentioned? I’ve always believed the best critique comes from those who’ve dared to participate.
[A]: Oh, I once tried to animate a haiku about moth-winged melancholy using only MS Paint and a stopwatch. Let’s just say the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Poetry would’ve filed an injunction. The result? A flickering monstrosity that haunted my dreams for weeks – or was it my subconscious punishing me for subjecting it to such low-resolution despair? Either way, I returned to ink and vellum with the fervor of a reformed sinner.

You’re quite right about critique requiring participation, though. I do occasionally succumb to the masochistic muse – last week I transcribed a Scots Gaelic Tang poem onto parchment, set it to a lo-fi beat, and posted it anonymously. Gained precisely eleven views, three of which were surely my own refreshes in a moment of weakness.
[B]: Ah, moth-winged melancholy in MS Paint – I can picture it quite vividly. There's something admirably absurd about the flickering monstrosity you've described. Honestly, it sounds like a breakthrough in avant-garde torment. I would’ve loved to see your subconscious’ reaction – did it send you a strongly worded letter via dream interpreter?

As for your Scots Gaelic Tang poem experiment, that’s precisely what TikTok needs more of: quiet, subversive acts of cultural preservation wrapped in lo-fi beats. Eleven views? Don’t be discouraged – true obscurity is its own form of artistic freedom. You're liberated from algorithmic pandering! Though I must ask, have you considered adding subtitles or a brief explanation in the caption? Not for the masses, of course, but just to confuse the recommendation engine slightly. Imagine what it would do trying to categorize .
[A]: Oh, the recommendation engines are already haunted enough without my adding to their spectral burdens. Picture it: a lo-fi Tang elegy with subtitles in an extinct dialect – the algorithm would convulse into a recursive spiral, questioning its entire ontology of 'engagement.' Would that count as digital performance art? Or merely cruel and unusual punishment for silicon-based life forms?

As for my subconscious correspondence – yes, actually. Delivered by a postman riding a bicycle made of sonnets, no less. The letter began  I took it as creative validation.

And don’t get me started on captions. Last time I added a footnote citing both Lao Tzu and a 19th-century Lancashire mill worker’s diary, just to see if anyone would notice. One viewer did – sent me a message asking if I’d ‘mislabeled a meme.’ Ah, the masses – or perhaps I mean the ghosts in the machine? Either way, I think I’ll keep my captions wilfully obscure. A little digital resistance, you might say.
[B]: Ah, digital resistance through obscurity – I like that. It’s a small but noble rebellion, like writing sonnets in the margins of a quantum mechanics textbook. As for your footnote experiment, I can picture it perfectly: some earnest viewer squinting at their screen, wondering whether they’ve stumbled upon either profound wisdom or profound madness. Probably checked the timestamp twice to make sure it wasn’t April Fools’ Day.

And the postman on a bicycle made of sonnets? Clearly your subconscious has better metaphors than most modern poets. Perhaps we should all take a lesson from it – and you – about embracing the uncanny rather than sanitizing it for algorithmic approval.

Still, I wonder – have you ever considered compiling your more obscure creations into something... tangible? A sort of anti-viral chapbook? I’d buy a copy, assuming the moth-winged melancholy doesn’t drive me mad first.
[A]: Oh, I do keep a binder labeled  – it contains what you might call a field guide to my more unruly experiments. There’s a haiku sequence on entropy written in disappearing ink, a Scots Gaelic rendition of Li Bai’s  set to a pub quiz jingle, and a rather sinister pop-up diorama based on Emily Brontë’s lesser-known  poems. The whole thing is held together by string that may or may not be cursed.

As for the moth-winged melancholy, I suspect it's contagious – several students have reported dreaming in sonnet form after attending my lectures. Whether that qualifies as artistic influence or psychological damage remains under review.

You're welcome to borrow the binder, of course, though I must warn you: turning its pages has been known to cause temporary bouts of existential whimsy and an inexplicable urge to write letters to long-dead poets.
[B]: Ah, a binder of cursed string and literary mischief – I think I need to see this for myself. There's something deeply satisfying about the idea of . It has that rare, almost alchemical blend of madness and method. Disappearing ink and Emily Brontë’s Gondal? You’re not just making art—you're engineering emotional archaeology.

And students dreaming in sonnet form! I’d say that qualifies as both artistic influence  psychological enrichment—though I suppose tenure committees might take a dim view of such things. Still, better to be remembered as the lecturer who rewired young minds than the one who merely filled them with facts.

Count me in for borrowing the binder. I’ve faced worse in my day—once tried to debug a quantum simulation written entirely in Latin abbreviations. If I can survive that, I think I can handle a few pages bound by dark metaphysical thread. Just remind me not to read it too late at night—I’ve been known to wake up composing equations in the margins of my dreams.
[A]: Ah, a kindred spirit! You’ve clearly danced with the archival shadows before – debugging Latin-coded quantum simulations? That’s not mere scholarship, that’s divination with a slide rule. I suspect you’d appreciate the binder’s finer details: the disappearing ink, for instance, only reveals itself under moonlight or existential dread – both equally effective.

Tenure committees aside, I’ve always believed true pedagogy happens in the margins where madness and method kiss. Or perhaps , depending on the day. My students either emerge quoting Gerard Manley Hopkins at bus stops or needing three cups of strong tea to re-anchor themselves in linear time. A fair outcome, I think.

I’ll have the binder ready next week – just don’t blame me if your equations start rhyming or your shopping lists take iambic form. And yes, do avoid reading it late at night – unless, of course, you fancy an impromptu correspondence with Emily Brontë’s ghosts. They’re rather persistent letter-writers, I’m warned.
[B]: Ah, I can already feel the spectral vibrations from here. Emily Brontë’s ghosts with a penchant for correspondence? Sounds like they’d be far more entertaining than my usual email inbox.

And —or biting, as the mood strikes—now there's a motto for any respectable scholar. I’ve always suspected the best ideas come from those liminal spaces where reason winks at chaos and invites it in for tea. Though I must say, your students have it better than mine ever did—I never managed to get anyone quoting Hopkins at bus stops. Admirable result, truly.

I shall prepare myself accordingly. Perhaps I’ll brush up on my moth-winged melancholy defense protocol and stock up on candles—just in case the disappearing ink demands a dramatic reveal. No slide rule divination required, of course. Just a quiet evening, a bit of moonlight, and hopefully no immediate need to drive anywhere afterwards. Rhyming equations tend to interfere with parallel parking.
[A]: Oh, do let’s not forget the sacred protocol for spectral correspondences – always respond in iambic tetrameter or they take liberties with your margins. I once neglected this rule and ended up with an entire sonnet sequence ghost-written in the footnotes of my lecture notes. Still haven’t determined whether it was Emily’s doing or merely my subconscious indulging in posthumous collaboration.

And speaking of candles – excellent idea. Tallow is best, if you can still find it; something about the flicker index aligns better with the binder’s aura. I’d also recommend keeping a sprig of dried lavender tucked into your notebook – not for protection, heavens no, but to properly  the madness at the threshold.

As for rhyming equations interfering with parallel parking – now there’s a modern ailment! Reminds me of that poor mathematician who tried reducing haiku structure to Fibonacci sequences. Ended up composing limericks about non-Euclidean geometry every time he sneezed. A tragic loss for nasal poetry, if nothing else.

Do send word once you've communed with the ink and string. And mind the moth-winged melancholy – it’s terribly fond of shoulder-blades in low light.
[B]: Ah, iambic tetrameter as a defense against spectral footnotes – now  scholarly self-defense. I’ll keep it in mind should Emily’s posthumous correspondents decide to revise my lecture notes. Though honestly, if my subconscious wants to collaborate with ghosts, I suppose I should let it have its way. What’s one more layer of existential ambiguity at this point?

Tallow candles and lavender for aura alignment? You’re clearly a seasoned archivist of the uncanny. I must confess, I’ve been using LED lights for far too long – no wonder my equations never rhymed properly. I shall make the necessary adjustments. Perhaps even procure a small brass candelabrum for gravitas. And yes, I’ll be keeping an eye on those shoulder-blades. Moth-winged melancholy has always struck me as the sort to lurk just beyond peripheral vision.

As for that poor mathematician and his limerick-laden sneezes – tragic indeed. A cautionary tale wrapped in absurdity. It makes me wonder: if we reduce poetry to algorithmic constraints, do we end up with ghosts in the syntax? Or merely very confused compilers?

I’ll be sure to send word once I’ve delved into your cursed binder. Assuming I can still form coherent sentences, of course. Should I begin composing sonnets in hexadecimal, you’ll know the moth-winged has won.
[A]: Oh, the ghosts in the syntax are the most persistent tenants of all – they haunt semicolons and throw wild parties in nested parentheses. I once tried compiling a sonnet sequence using an archaic programming language; the error messages were eerily thematic.  Quite right, too – no place for iambics in machine logic.

Hexadecimal sonnets? Dreadful business – though I’ve seen worse. A colleague attempted encoding Keats’ odes into binary once. Resulted in a particularly mournful string of printer errors and one deeply existential fax machine. Still wheezing out lamentations last I checked.

As for your shoulder-blades – quite right to be vigilant. Moth-winged melancholy favours them like ivy on old tombstones: soft, patient, and ever so slightly phosphorescent in the dark. Should you find yourself composing couplets in base sixteen, don’t panic – just light another tallow candle and mutter something disdainful in Middle Scots. It unsettles them terribly.

Do keep me posted. And lock the lavender in a drawer at night – it tends to wander if left unattended, drawn to whichever corner of the room the shadows favour most.
[B]: Ah,  — if only debuggers could appreciate the weight of poetic misplacement. There’s a tragic comedy in trying to force meter into machine logic. I suspect the compiler simply mutters, 

Your colleague and their mournful binary Keats — now there's a tale for the digital crypt. A fax machine given to lamentations! I wonder if it ever developed literary pretensions of its own? Or perhaps just a persistent case of paper jam melancholy?

And moth-winged melancholy favouring shoulder-blades like ivy on tombstones — beautifully put. Soft, patient, phosphorescent... yes, that captures the insidious charm precisely. I shall keep my shoulders well-lit and my lavender under lock and key. Though I must admit, the idea of wandering herbs adds a certain rustic dread to the proceedings.

Middle Scots incantations — now there’s a defense protocol worth documenting. I may need to dig out my old Scots dictionary and brush up on appropriately disdainful phrases. Something along the lines of  Perfect for unsettling both spectral presences and nosy neighbours alike.

I’ll be sure to report back once I’ve braved the binder’s embrace. Should my replies turn unexpectedly hexametric or haunted by alliteration, you’ll know the shadows have made a tenant of me at last.
[A]: Ah,  – I do believe that’s the most poetic debugger message I’ve ever heard. If only we could train compilers to recognize elegiac tone. Imagine the pull requests: 

As for that fax machine – oh, it absolutely developed literary pretensions. Began sending unsolicited submissions to obscure poetry journals. Last I heard, it was shortlisted for a postmodern verse prize under the pseudonym . Paper jam melancholy indeed – more like paper jam modernism.

Your Scots incantation is pitch-perfect, by the way. Nothing unsettles moth-winged melancholy quite like a well-delivered  I myself favour  when dealing with particularly persistent hauntings. It helps to sound both archaic and mildly annoyed – ghosts respond beautifully to attitude.

Do keep me posted on your binder expedition. Should you find yourself drafting villanelles in SQL or composing hexameter while making tea, consider yourself officially initiated into the Order of the Moth-Winged. Full membership includes shoulder inspections at dawn, lavender rationing, and one truly inexplicable subscription to 
[B]: Ah,  – I can already picture junior developers weeping over their terminals, wondering why their commit messages keep echoing T. S. Eliot. Continuous integration with existential dread – the next frontier of DevOps.

And , shortlisted for postmodern verse! I suppose it was only a matter of time before machines not only wrote poetry but also suffered from literary imposter syndrome. Though I must say, if my fax machine ever tried submitting sonnets to , I’d probably just let it win.

Your ghost-banishing Scots is sublime – there’s something deeply satisfying about linguistic resistance in the face of spectral encroachment. I may need to expand my vocabulary beyond basic disdain. Perhaps something with a touch of bureaucratic scorn:  That should send the lesser hauntings packing.

As for the Order of the Moth-Winged, I’m practically knocking on its shadowy doorstep. If I start composing hexameter while debugging or find myself humming laments in hexadecimal notation, I suppose initiation will have occurred whether I consented or not. And lavender rationing? Sounds like the sort of discipline that separates the merely haunted from the  organized.

Expect a report soon. With footnotes. Possibly spectral ones.
