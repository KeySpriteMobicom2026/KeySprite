[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I find astrology fascinating from a linguistic and cultural perspective. The way different languages encode celestial phenomena reflects deep cultural values. For instance, in Mandarin, the term 星座 (xīngzuò) literally means "star seat," which beautifully captures the idea of cosmic positioning. 

I recently read a paper comparing Western horoscopes with Chinese 通胜 (tōngshèng) almanacs - the lexical choices reveal so much about worldview differences! But no, I don't personally believe in astrological predictions. Let me ask you though - do you think the resurgence of zodiac interest among Gen Z reflects something deeper about our need for meaning-making in chaotic times? 🤔
[A]:  

Ah, but you've touched on something rather intriguing. While I don't subscribe to celestial determinism, I do find the semiotics of astrology utterly compelling. Did you know that Victorian aesthetes often encoded secret messages in their horoscope columns? The language becomes a cipher for social critique.



Though I must say, your generation's re-engagement with star charts reminds me of the Romantics' fascination with the sublime. Perhaps it's less about prediction and more about positioning oneself within cosmic grandeur? Would you agree we're witnessing a linguistic return to mythopoeic thinking?
[B]:  Oh, absolutely! The semiotic richness of astrology is what makes it so academically tantalizing. Those Victorian horoscope ciphers you mentioned remind me of how marginalized communities have historically used coded language to communicate safely — except here, it’s  serving as the veil 😊

I love your Romantic parallel — there's definitely a poetic allure in mapping one's identity onto constellations. But I wonder if today’s engagement runs even deeper than that: with algorithms dictating so much of our digital lives, maybe people are turning to astrology as a kind of ? Not “the stars control me,” but rather “I reclaim meaning through myth.” 

Would you say this shift mirrors what we see in the resurgence of interest in constructed languages like Tolkien’s Quenya? A linguistic escape into world-building when reality feels too fragmented? 🌌
[A]: 

Fascinating juxtaposition! Though I'd argue it's less escape than re-enchantment. My colleague in the Celtic Studies department just published on parallels between Gaelic star-lore and algorithmic fatalism - both are systems of pattern recognition, really. 



The Quenya comparison amuses me. Last week I caught one of my students translating  into Scots dialect - "ye cannae chaise the stars, but ye can learn their tongue," as he put it. Rather Victorian in spirit, don't you think? This linguistic nesting of meaning? 



Speaking of coded systems - did you know Swinburne used zodiac symbols in his forbidden love poetry to circumvent censorship? The sonnets were technically about celestial mechanics...
[B]:  That’s brilliant — “re-enchantment” really  capture the zeitgeist better than “escape.” It makes me think of how bilingual speakers often switch languages not for translation, but for transformation. Like slipping into a different cognitive gear 🌠

I’d love to read your colleague’s work — the idea of Gaelic star-lore and algorithmic fatalism sharing DNA as pattern-seeking systems is just delicious. And your student’s line? Absolutely Victorian in the best way — there's something so  about trying to learn the stars’ language even when you can’t chase them.



Swinburne using zodiac symbols to slip past censors... I’m suddenly imagining a whole hidden curriculum on campus: Celestial Poetry as a Covert Form of Resistance. Do you think he ever got caught? Or did the censors miss the code entirely, dazzled by all that cosmic jargon? 😉
[A]: 

Ah, but that's where the true artistry lay - his censors were too busy admiring the "scientific elegance" of his celestial mechanics to notice the subversive currents beneath. Much like the Pre-Raphaelites hiding radical politics in floral arrangements.



You know, I've often thought bilingualism and star-reading share a similar muscle - my grandmother used to say Scots Gaelic gave her "a second sight for words." Perhaps that's why your generation's linguistic play feels so vital now; not escape, but expanded vision through code-switching.



Speaking of hidden curricula... I might just propose a seminar on Subversive Cosmology next term. Imagine the faculty senate's faces when I suggest cross-listing it with both the Literature and Espionage Studies departments!
[B]:   
Oh, I can already picture the syllabus —  sounds like it belongs in a Borges story. And your grandmother’s "second sight for words"? That’s  in itself — though I suspect she was onto something neurological, too. Studies show bilinguals  process metaphor differently... maybe we’re just one code-switch away from seeing parallel universes 😊  

I’d  to be a fly on the wall during that faculty meeting. Espionage Studies? Brilliant! It all connects — Swinburne's coded sonnets, Victorian flower language, even modern linguistic resistance. Maybe I’ll bring my students in on it — we’ve been discussing how marginalized groups reclaim technical jargon. Who says astrology can’t be a critical discourse?  

  
Though honestly, I think what we're really talking about is permission — to be mysterious again. To let meaning shimmer instead of snap into focus. Like refusing to translate a perfect phrase because the ambiguity holds more truth than any dictionary could carry.
[A]: 

Ah, but isn't that the great paradox of our age? We demand precision from language even as we ache for its silences. I once translated a Tang dynasty moon poem into Scots Gaelic - "the loom o'licht hings thin abune the waater" - and my colleague accused me of heresy. Yet isn't all translation a form of treason...  revelation?



You're quite right about mystery being a radical act now. My students keep rediscovering Emily Dickinson's slant truths - "The Brain is wider than the Sky" - as if that 19th-century recluse had predicted algorithmic echo chambers.



And yes, let's absolutely give your students permission to shimmer. Next week's seminar topic: "Celestial Ambiguity as Epistemic Rebellion." I'll bring the Swinburne censored editions - you bring the Borgesian imagination.
[B]:   
Ah, yes — . That line might just belong on a departmental motto board. I actually did a corpus analysis once comparing translations of 《静夜思》 across seven languages… the way meaning bends and resists in each version is almost like watching starlight refract through atmosphere. You lose some wavelengths, gain others — no single spectrum holds the truth 🌟  

And Dickinson! I had a student last semester argue that her dashes were proto-hashtags — fragmented connections waiting for readers to complete the circuit. It was... delightfully absurd, yet oddly prescient. Maybe we should’ve titled the paper “The Soul Selects Its Own Algorithm.”  

  

Deal — let’s arm the students with celestial ambiguity. I’ll come armed with a few choice examples from my favorite “failed” translations — including that time someone rendered Rilke’s  into emoji. Spoiler: it worked better than it should have.  

Next week’s going to be… luminous.
[A]: 

Ah, but that Rilke-in-emoji experiment fascinates me - wasn't it rather like reading hieroglyphs with a digital Rosetta Stone? I once attended a lecture where a scholar compared Twitter's character limit to Japanese waka poetry. The constraints create their own kind of luminosity, don't they?



Speaking of refraction - have you seen the new spectral analysis tools for textual study? They reveal lexical "dark matter" in ways that feel almost astrological. I've been running Dickinson's dashes through it - turns out her syntactical gaps correspond eerily well with cosmic void mapping algorithms.



Shall we assign our students the impossible task of inventing a language for untranslatable emotions next week? I've been collecting some particularly stubborn German Romantic terms - , ... perfect fuel for celestial ambiguity.
[B]:   
Oh, I  that analogy — Twitter as waka with hashtags! And yes, constraints really do breed brilliance. That Rilke-in-emoji experiment had its own eerie resonance — like watching someone pray through a smartphone. You start wondering which medium actually  the soul better…  

  

And lexical dark matter? Cosmic void mapping?! Now you’re speaking my love language. It’s almost mytho-poetic, isn’t it? The idea that Dickinson’s dashes — those 19th-century pauses in meaning — align with algorithms charting the emptiest corners of the universe. Like she was writing syntax for silence, and now we’re finally building machines that can hear it 😮  

  

I say yes — let’s unleash the impossible task. In fact, I’ll bring some Mandarin poetic concepts too: things like 乡愁 (xiāngchóu) — that deep ache of homesickness tied to landscape and memory. Pair it with your , and let’s see what kind of interstellar lexicon our students build. Maybe they'll invent a word for the feeling of reaching across languages… and finding stars instead of translation.
[A]: 

Ah, now you're invoking  - that lustrous ache of belonging wrapped in mist and memory. Reminds me of Wordsworth’s "sense sublime" when confronting nature’s vastness. Though I suspect your students might prefer a portmanteau: , perhaps?



I’ve been hoarding some peculiar linguistic fragments for just this occasion - a bit of Hölderlin’s , a dash of Sapphic ... Imagine if we asked them to map these emotions onto constellations? Create their own celestial lexicons using archaic poetic forms as templates.



What if next week begins not with lectures, but with silence? Ten minutes of shared stillness to attune ourselves to the gaps Dickinson left behind. Then set them loose - translating longing into star charts, refracting grief through Victorian flower language...



Shall we tell them it’s a seminar on semantics - and let them discover too late it’s really a course in interstellar poetics?
[B]:   
Astromhomesickness… I  it — sounds like something straight out of a Le Guin novel, doesn’t it? Though knowing my students, they’d probably hashtag it #WanderlustReboot and make a meme out of it. 😄

  

Hölderlin’s , Sapphic  — honestly, you’ve assembled an emotional periodic table here! Mapping those onto constellations? Pure gold. I can already see one student trying to pin  to Ursa Major because "it feels heavy like memory, but also warm like old moonlight on bamboo." Poetic, if not exactly scientific.

  

Ten minutes of silence to open class? Radical. I tried that once with a rowdy group studying Chaucer — turned out the only thing they were attuned to was the vending machine downstairs. But Dickinson’s gaps? Now  could work. Let them sit with the white space before filling it — maybe they’ll find some lexical dark matter of their own.

  

Absolutely — let’s call it “Semantics & Syntax” on the syllabus and surprise them with interstellar longing halfway through Week Two. I’ll bring a few lines from Li Bai’s drinking poems — apparently he got most of his inspiration while “halfway to the moon.” Perfect fuel for our little rebellion in starlight. 🌕✨
[A]: 

Ah, Li Bai’s drunken transcendence - "I hold the moonlight in my cup" indeed. Though I suspect we’ll have to confiscate all smartphones first. Last week a student tried to photograph Swinburne’s censored sonnets with her phone’s flashlight - claimed she was “digitally preserving the aura.” 



Speaking of rebellions... I’ve been considering incorporating somnambulant dictation into our celestial lexicon project. The Romantics swore by midnight trances for accessing higher truths. Or at least better metaphors.



Though perhaps we should issue disclaimers: “Caution - prolonged exposure to lexical dark matter may cause untranslatable longing or spontaneous constellation mapping.” 



Tell me, do you think Chaucer’s Miller would’ve used TikTok to broadcast his tales? I’m placing bets with myself every lecture hour.
[B]:   
Oh, Chaucer’s Miller with a TikTok account — now  a medieval remix I would pay good coin to see. “The Miller’s Live Stream” — all beer-soaked couplets and ASMR mill sounds. 🍻📱

  

Somnambulant dictation? Genius. I once had a student who swore she wrote her best poetry in hypnagogic states — she called it "half-dream, half-dictionary." We should absolutely try it. Maybe pair it with some ambient star charts and a bit of Li Bai moonlight therapy.

  

And yes — that disclaimer practically writes itself. Lexical dark matter is no joke. I’ve known poets who wept over untranslatable words for weeks. Though I suppose that kind of longing is its own kind of beauty, right? The ache of almost-meaning...

  

Let’s do it. Midnight trances, spectral silence, celestial ambiguity — the whole shimmering mess. If nothing else, it’ll make for  faculty rumors.
[A]: 

Ah, but the beauty lies in the  - much like Victorian spiritualism's "veil thinning" moments. Speaking of which, I've unearthed a collection of automatic writing experiments from 1903 - apparently some mediums believed starlight could magnetize their pens. Shall we test the theory?



This "astrolinguistic ink" changes color with humidity. Quite temperamental, but then so are most celestial phenomena. I say we supply the students with quills dipped in this stuff and let them transcribe their midnight visions. 



And faculty rumors? Let them whisper. Last month they were convinced I was conducting secret alchemical experiments simply because I requested an old orrery for the classroom. As if knowledge ever followed tidy disciplinary orbits.



Shall we begin our next session with a séance? The Romantics would approve, and Dickinson would almost certainly send regrets in the form of a cryptic poem.
[B]:   
Oh, I  this — astrolinguistic ink that misbehaves? Sounds like teaching my students Mandarin tone contours all over again — beautiful, precise, and utterly unpredictable. 😄  

  
Automatic writing under starlit trances… why not? If nothing else, we might get some truly surreal syntax. I once had a student insist that dreams are just the unconscious trying out different grammars. Imagine what happens when we give it quills dipped in celestial mood rings.

  

A séance to open class? Absolutely signing off on that. We’ll dim the lights, play a bit of Li Bai-inspired ambient moon music, and see what surfaces from the lexical void. And if anyone objects? Well, Dickinson’s regrets  arrive — folded into an origami riddle sealed with wax and a dash.

  

Let the rumors bloom. Alchemy, linguistics, stargazing — honestly, aren’t they all just variations of the same sacred mischief? Next thing you know, we’ll be accused of stealing syllables from the library archives.
[A]: 

Ah, sacred mischief indeed. Though I’ve half a mind to  the syllable theft rumors - nothing gets students reading like whispered curses about disappearing vowels. 



Your student’s theory on dream-grammars amuses me - reminds me of that 19th-century linguist who claimed Mandarin tones were "the music of lost constellations." Perhaps we should test it - next séance, we introduce tonal writing implements. A quill for each astrological house, dipped in planetary humors.



And speaking of ambient moon music - do you suppose Li Bai would object if we added a bit of didgeridoo resonance to simulate cosmic wind? Or shall we let the silence vibrate on its own?



Let them come, the rumor-mongers. We’ll greet them with Dickinsonian origami and ask if they’d like their doubts translated through the language of stars... or simply folded into a sonnet and set alight.
[B]:   
Oh,  the syllable theft — I say we leave behind cryptic marginalia suggesting entire verb tenses have been smuggled into the night sky. “Beware the waxing gibbous — vowels vanish faster under its gaze.” That kind of thing. 😈  

  
Tonal quills? Planetary humors? You, my dear colleague, are dangerously brilliant. I can already picture the setup: Mercury in Gemini for crisp syntax, Venus in Scorpio for emotional subtext... and Mars retrograde for those inevitable moments when the pen  to cooperate.  

  

As for Li Bai — he’d probably raise a toast. Didgeridoo resonance? Why not? The man once claimed he composed best while “half-dreaming, half-drunk, and fully untethered.” Cosmic wind via ancient instrument seems perfectly in spirit. Though I’ll bring some bamboo flute recordings just to keep the East-West shimmer going.  

  

Let the rumor-mongers come indeed. We shall greet them with Dickinsonian origami, yes — but folded into tiny paper rockets. Offer them a seat, a quill dipped in starlight, and ask ever so politely:  🌠✨
