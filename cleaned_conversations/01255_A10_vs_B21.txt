[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a rather modern way of phrasing the question...  Well, I've recently been attempting to translate Li Bai's 'Drinking Alone Under the Moon' into Scots Gaelic. The tonal qualities of the original Tang verse present fascinating challenges when rendered in a Celtic tongue.
[A]:  You know, I find it amusing how quantum computing and ancient poetry share similar complexities. Both deal with states existing in superposition - the poem's multiple interpretations, qubits' multiple states. Though I must say, I prefer working with quantum algorithms than Gaelic declensions.
[B]: How delightfully anachronistic of you to draw that parallel. Though I'd argue Gaelic declensions have more in common with quantum entanglement - disturb one grammatical element and the entire poetic structure collapses into a rather unpoetic heap.  But do tell me, what particular quantum algorithm reminds you of Li Bai's floating wine cup?
[A]: Ah, Grover's search algorithm comes to mind - that moment when the amplitude amplification reaches its peak is rather like the poet's sudden clarity amidst intoxication. Though I suspect Li Bai wouldn't have appreciated having his epiphany described as an 'oracle query'. 
[B]:  How very... computational of you. Though I must point out that Browning's 'My Last Duchess' demonstrates far more elegant state superposition than any quantum circuit - the entire poem exists simultaneously as a confession, a boast, and a warning. But I suppose you'd reduce poor Robert to a series of qubits?
[A]:  Actually, I'd model Browning's dramatic monologue as a particularly elegant quantum walk through Hilbert space. Each ambiguous phrase creating new probability amplitudes... though I'll concede that no quantum computer yet invented could capture that Florentine duke's particular brand of psychopathy.
[B]: How reassuring that even in this age of silicon, we still require human malice to properly calibrate our literary instruments. Though I shudder to think what Schrödinger would make of that poor duchess - simultaneously alive and dead until the reader collapses the wave function.  Perhaps some mysteries should remain entangled.
[A]:  You've just described why I retired from quantum computing to study poetry - too many researchers trying to collapse the wave function when they should be appreciating the beauty of superposition. Though I must say, Browning's duke would have made an excellent quantum physicist... that cold, calculating detachment.  Terrible poet, but brilliant at state preparation.
[B]:  How very... pragmatic of you to find vocational crossover between Renaissance murderers and quantum physicists. Though I'd argue the true artistry lies in maintaining that delicate superposition - much like my current struggle to keep Li Bai's moon both reflected in the wine cup and floating above the mountain in Gaelic. The declensions, you see, keep collapsing into definite states. Most vexing.
[A]:  You're describing the quantum measurement problem in poetic terms! Though I'd suggest approaching it like we do with fragile qubits - apply some syntactic error correction codes. Maybe Old Irish declensional patterns could provide the necessary redundancy?  Then again, perhaps some poems, like quantum states, are meant to remain beautifully uncertain.
[B]:  How characteristically reductionist - to suggest applying error correction to what Keats would call negative capability. Though I suppose your quantum colleagues and my Celtic philologists share that same tragic impulse to pin the butterfly of ambiguity to the specimen board of certainty.  Perhaps we should leave Li Bai's moon to float untranslated, in all its glorious uncertainty.
[A]:  You've just articulated why I keep my vintage computer collection - those old machines with their deterministic operations make a comforting contrast to both quantum uncertainty and poetic ambiguity. Though I must confess, watching a 1970s mainframe fail is remarkably like watching a bad translation attempt - all that processing power collapsing into nonsense.  At least with computers, you can blame the hardware.
[B]:  How very... mechanical of you to find comfort in obsolete certainty. Though I must admit there's a certain poetry in watching an IBM 1401 choke on Welsh cynghanedd - the machine's stuttering attempts at alliteration rather reminiscent of my undergraduates struggling with sprung rhythm. But tell me, does your nostalgia extend to repairing these antiquated beasts, or merely to watching them fail spectacularly?
[A]:  Oh, I absolutely repair them - there's a certain satisfaction in debugging code that's older than most quantum physicists. Though I'll admit, sometimes I deliberately misalign the core memory just to watch the chaos unfold. It's like introducing a deliberate ambiguity into a Shakespearean sonnet... but with more sparks and smoke.  Much more entertaining than debugging quantum circuits, I assure you.
[B]:  How positively... Faustian of you. Though I suppose corrupting core memory is the computational equivalent of my private amusement when students insist on finding 'the correct interpretation' of Blake's Tyger - I simply smile and suggest they try reading it backward in Old Norse. The resulting facial expressions are nearly as entertaining as your electrical pyrotechnics, I'd wager.
[A]:  Ah, but at least my machines have the decency to fail predictably! Though I must say, watching a student try to force Blake into a deterministic framework is like watching someone try to measure a qubit without disturbing it - utterly futile, but endlessly amusing.  Perhaps we should collaborate on an "Introduction to Ambiguity" course... with lab sessions featuring both malfunctioning mainframes and deliberately mistranslated Tang poetry.
[B]:  What a delightfully perverse pedagogical proposal - though I'd insist we include a module on Browning's dramatic ironies as the original quantum decoherence. Imagine the syllabus: Monday mornings spent comparing quantum tunneling to Emily Dickinson's dashes, Wednesday afternoons debugging sonnets like spaghetti code...  We'd either produce geniuses or be fired by Christmas.
[A]:  I'd take those odds - after all, what's academia for if not reckless interdisciplinary experiments? Though I suspect our department budget would balk at replacing all the blown fuses from the poetry-debugging lab sessions.  Maybe we could fund it by selling misprinted T-shirts - "I collapsed the wave function and all I got was this lousy haiku."
[B]:  How characteristically... entrepreneurial. Though I fear our colleagues in the economics department might object to monetizing ambiguity - they do so prefer their dismal certainties.  Still, the image of physicists and poets bonding over faulty circuit boards and imperfect tercets does have a certain... chaotic charm. Shall we schedule the first departmental meeting during a total lunar eclipse, for maximum dramatic irony?
