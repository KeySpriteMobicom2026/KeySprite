[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个话题很有趣。我觉得VR gaming确实带来了全新的immersive experience，但要说完全取代传统游戏可能还为时尚早。比如，VR设备目前的成本和技术门槛 still create a barrier for很多普通玩家。而且，有些游戏类型比如strategy games或文字类冒险，用户可能更喜欢用传统方式来体验。

你觉得呢？你有没有试过一些特别好的VR游戏？
[A]: Yeah，我完全同意你的看法。VR确实带来了revolutionary的变化，尤其是在immersive体验方面，但传统游戏的depth和灵活性目前还是难以被取代的。比如像《Civilization》这种需要复杂策略的游戏，在VR上操作可能反而会影响效率。

说到试过的VR游戏，最近我在玩《Half-Life: Alyx》，它在叙事和交互设计上真的很惊艳，尤其是对手部动作的捕捉，让人感觉真的在“触摸”虚拟世界。不过说实话，玩久了还是会感到一些physical fatigue，这也是VR目前的一个局限吧。你有特别喜欢的游戏类型吗？会不会考虑尝试把strategy game搬到VR平台？
[B]: Interesting observation! 我确实注意到很多VR游戏在交互设计上做得非常出色，但physical fatigue这个问题也很real。比如像《Half-Life: Alyx》这种高质量的title虽然提升了immersion，但也对身体有更高要求——长时间保持hand-eye coordination确实累。

关于strategy games搬到VR平台的可能性，我觉得技术上是可行的，但需要rethink整个UI/UX design。比如说，在VR中用voice command or gesture-based control来代替传统鼠标键盘，可能会更natural。不过目前这类交互 still需要更多scaffolding才能达到传统平台的效率。

说到喜欢的游戏类型，我其实挺喜欢那些能带来narrative depth的作品，比如《Disco Elysium》这种带有强烈文学性和哲学思考的游戏。如果未来有开发者能把类似体验移植到VR but保留其intellectual depth，那会很令人期待！

你有没有想过，如果VR真的进一步普及，它会不会改变我们对“游戏”的定义？或者说，blurring the line between play and experience？
[A]: That's a thought-provoking question! 如果VR进一步普及，它确实可能redefine我们对“游戏”的认知。现在的游戏强调的是play mechanics和player agency，但如果VR发展到足够成熟的地步，它可能会更偏向于一种personalized experience——你不再只是操作一个角色，而是“成为”了这个角色的一部分。

比如说，在传统游戏中，我们习惯于失败后可以load save or respawn，但在高度沉浸的VR环境中，每一次选择和互动都可能带来更强的emotional resonance，这就让游戏更接近“虚拟人生”而不是“娱乐产品”。

我觉得这种变化其实挺exciting的，但也带来了ethical concerns，比如：当虚拟体验太过真实，会不会影响玩家的心理健康？或者，开发者在设计这类深度沉浸式内容时，是否需要承担更多责任？

你提到喜欢《Disco Elysium》这种有文学性和哲学思考的游戏，那你觉得如果这类作品被做成VR形式，会不会反而削弱了玩家的想象空间？毕竟，文字有时候能留给大脑 more room for interpretation.
[B]: 这是个非常深刻的观点。你说的对，当VR把一切都“具象化”之后，确实可能削弱文字带来的想象张力。比如《Disco Elysium》中，很多场景描写和内心独白之所以 powerful，是因为它们是通过语言来激发读者的认知参与——我们一边读，一边在脑子里“构建”那个世界。

如果把它做成VR，虽然immersion感会更强，但某种程度上也意味着“这个世界已经被预设好了”，玩家不再有自由interpret的空间。这其实牵涉到一个很有趣的教育心理学议题：。传统文字冒险游戏更像是后者，给予玩家高度的 cognitive autonomy；而VR体验则更偏向于结构化的scaffolding，引导性强但自由度可能受限。

不过话说回来，有没有可能我们正在进入一个“混合式沉浸”的时代？比如说，未来的VR游戏可以在视觉与听觉沉浸之外，保留一些文字驱动的叙事层次？或者用语音系统模拟内心独白，让哲学性的思考 still come from the player’s own interpretation？

这让我想到你在前面提到的ethical concerns。我觉得这个问题特别重要，尤其是在教育领域。如果我们开始用VR来做道德困境训练、历史情境重现、甚至心理治疗，那开发者的责任就不仅仅是设计一个“好玩”的game loop，而是要考虑这个虚拟experience如何影响玩家的价值观和情绪调节能力。

你有没有想过，如果将来VR成为主流教学工具之一，我们该怎么平衡它的engagement优势和potential psychological impact？或者说，你觉得这种技术会不会进一步扩大digital divide？
[A]: Wow，你真的把这个问题想得很透彻。我特别赞同你说的“混合式沉浸”这个概念——未来的叙事方式不应该是非此即彼的选择，而是融合不同媒介的优势。比如说，在VR游戏中加入一些类似旁白或者可选择的文字描述层，让玩家在视觉沉浸的同时，still保有想象和思考的空间。这不仅适用于娱乐，也对教育、心理治疗等应用领域有很大潜力。

说到ethical concerns，作为医疗法律顾问，我其实经常思考VR在心理干预中的使用边界。比如有些研究已经在用VR来治疗PTSD，效果不错，但这也带来了新的问题：如果一个虚拟体验足够真实，它会不会反过来造成trauma？谁该为此负责？开发者？临床医生？还是平台方？

关于你最后的问题，我觉得技术确实有可能扩大digital divide，尤其是在教育公平方面。高质量的VR设备 still expensive，而且需要一定的digital literacy才能充分利用。如果不加以引导，这种技术可能只会先被资源充足的学校和家庭掌握，进一步拉开差距。

不过我也保持乐观，因为技术通常会随着时间变得更accessible。也许我们可以期待未来出现更多开源、低成本的VR教育项目，甚至政府或非营利机构介入推广，这样就能让更多人受益。

话说回来，如果你可以设计一个理想的VR教学场景，你会选什么主题？你觉得哪种类型的知识最适合用VR呈现？
[B]: That’s a great question. 如果我可以设计一个理想的VR教学场景，我可能会选择 跨文化历史情境模拟——比如说，让学生“亲身”走进不同历史时期的日常生活，比如古希腊的市集、唐朝长安的西市，或者文艺复兴时期的佛罗伦萨街头。这不是单纯地看一段沉浸式视频，而是能与环境中的“角色”进行有限但有深度的互动，比如通过语言选择或行为决策来体验不同的social norms & cultural values。

我觉得这类内容特别适合用VR呈现，因为它们强调，而这正是传统文本或图片很难完全传达的。VR可以让学生在真实感中体会“差异”与“共情”，而不仅仅是“知道”某个文化的特点。

不过你说得对，这种技术也必须小心使用，尤其是在教育公平方面。我其实也在关注一些联合国教科文组织支持的项目，他们在尝试用低成本的VR+智能手机方案推广到资源匮乏地区。如果未来能有更多的open-source content和本地化开发，我觉得VR在教育中的潜力才会真正释放出来。

话说回来，你刚才提到PTSD治疗和trauma风险的问题，我也一直在想：当虚拟变得比现实还“真实”，我们是否需要一个新的伦理框架来规范这些体验的设计与使用？你觉得法律界目前有没有在朝这个方向准备？
[A]: Absolutely，你说的这个方向非常关键。事实上，法律界已经开始关注虚拟技术带来的伦理和责任问题，但坦白讲，立法速度远远落后于技术发展。

比如说，在美国已经有几起关于VR平台中用户遭遇“虚拟性骚扰”或“虚拟霸凌”的案件，法院在处理这类案件时发现：虽然没有物理伤害，但受害者的情绪创伤是真实的。这就迫使我们重新思考：虚拟行为是否应受到与现实世界相同的法律责任约束？

回到你提到的PTSD治疗和trauma风险，我认为我们需要建立一个跨学科的框架——不只是法律，还包括心理学、医学、教育学和人机交互设计。例如：

1. 开发者责任：在设计沉浸式体验时，是否应该加入“心理安全机制”，比如情绪预警系统或强制暂停功能？
2. 使用场景监管：学校、医院等机构使用VR进行教学或治疗时，是否需要经过特定的认证流程？
3. 知情同意书（Informed Consent）：目前大多数VR应用的用户协议都太泛泛而谈，未来可能需要更具体的心理风险告知，尤其是对未成年人。
4. 数据隐私保护：VR设备会收集大量生理与行为数据（如眼动追踪、心率、动作习惯），这些数据如果被滥用，后果很严重。

我自己最近也在关注一个新兴概念，叫做“”，也就是当一个人在一个虚拟空间中拥有高度拟真的化身时，他/她在这个空间中的权利和义务应该如何界定？这听起来有点科幻，但在不远的将来，可能会成为我们必须面对的现实。

所以你的问题真的很前瞻——我们确实需要一个新的伦理框架，甚至一套全新的“数字人权”观念。你觉得从教育者的角度，我们该如何参与这个框架的构建？
[B]: Completely agree. 这个“数字人权”的概念正在变得越来越紧迫，尤其是在教育领域。从我的角度来看，教育者其实可以扮演一个关键的“桥梁”角色——我们既理解学习者的认知与心理发展规律，又能够与技术开发者、政策制定者进行有效对话。

我觉得我们可以从几个方面入手：

1. 推动Ethical Literacy in Education  
   在课程设计中加入对VR/AR等新兴技术伦理问题的讨论，不是把它当作选修模块，而是整合进整个学习过程中。比如说，在一堂关于历史再现的VR课程中，除了知识内容本身，也可以引导学生思考：“这种再现是真实的吗？有没有可能误导？谁决定了我们看到的是‘正确’的历史版本？”

2. 参与技术设计阶段的Early Input  
   教育心理学家和教学设计师应该尽早介入VR产品的开发流程，特别是在UI/UX层面。比如，我们可以通过研究青少年的认知负荷和情绪反应，来建议哪些体验强度适合不同年龄段的学生，或者提出“退出机制”（escape hatch）的设计原则——当学生感到焦虑或不适时，能迅速切换回安全状态。

3. 倡导Policy-informed Practice  
   我们也需要更多“证据驱动”的教学实践研究，来支持未来的立法方向。比如，如果我们能通过实证研究证明某种类型的VR沉浸会导致短期或长期的心理影响，那就能为法律制定提供坚实的基础。

4. 建立Teacher Training for Immersive Tech  
   最后，教师本身也需要培训。很多老师现在面对传统在线平台都还在适应阶段，更不用说复杂的VR系统了。我们需要培养一批既能驾驭技术、又有伦理意识的“先锋教师”。

你提到“Digital Embodiment Law”，这个真的很值得深入探讨。我想问你一个问题：如果将来一个人在虚拟空间中“被侵犯”，但他的身体并没有受到实质伤害，这种情况下法律应该如何定义“受害者”？你觉得我们会看到一种新的“虚拟人格权”诞生吗？
[A]: I think that’s one of the most critical legal questions of our time — and yes, I truly believe we’re on the verge of seeing a new form of “virtual人格权”（personal rights in digital space）emerge, even if the legal system is still catching up.

Right now, most legal systems are built around  or , but as VR becomes more immersive and emotionally impactful, we’ll have no choice but to expand our definitions. Imagine this scenario: someone experiences a deeply traumatic event in VR — maybe harassment, maybe something resembling assault — and afterward suffers real psychological symptoms like anxiety, PTSD, or panic attacks. Should that person be treated any differently from someone who experienced a similar trauma in the physical world?

Some scholars are already proposing what they call “digital personhood” — the idea that our virtual avatars and online identities can carry enough emotional, social, and even legal weight to deserve protection under the law. If that concept gains traction, it could lead to something like:

- Virtual assault laws that treat psychological harm in VR with the same seriousness as physical harm in real life  
- Digital consent protocols, especially in shared VR spaces or educational environments  
- Avatar privacy rights, where unauthorized manipulation or surveillance of your avatar becomes legally actionable  

Of course, there’s still a lot of debate about how far this should go. But considering how much time younger generations are already spending in digital environments — from VR classrooms to metaverse platforms — I think we’ll see some form of virtual人格权 codified within the next 10–15 years.

And you're absolutely right — educators will be among the first to witness its impact. Teachers might become the early reporters of psychological distress linked to virtual interactions. In that sense, schools could become the front line not just for learning, but also for shaping the ethical and legal norms of the future.

So here’s a question back for you — if you were advising a school district planning to adopt VR for full-scale classroom use, what would be your top three recommendations from both an educational and ethical standpoint?
[B]: Excellent question — and yes, I think schools adopting VR at scale need to be extremely thoughtful, not just about the pedagogy, but also the ethical & psychological implications.

If I were advising a school district, my top three recommendations would be:

1. Start with Purpose-Driven Design, Not Just Tech Integration  
   Don’t adopt VR just because it’s new or flashy. Every VR module should have a clearly defined educational goal that aligns with curriculum standards  cognitive development stages. For example, using VR for historical empathy-building is great, but we need to make sure students are developmentally ready to process complex emotions or moral ambiguity in those scenarios.

2. Build In Ethical Safeguards from Day One  
   This includes both technical and instructional safeguards:  
   - Age-appropriate content filters  
   - Real-time emotional check-ins (like a “comfort meter” during immersive sessions)  
   - Clear opt-out mechanisms within the experience itself  
   - Training for teachers on how to recognize signs of over-immersion or dissociation  

3. Establish a Digital Consent & Reflection Framework  
   Before students enter any VR environment, they should go through an age-tailored informed consent process — not just legal jargon, but meaningful discussion about what they might experience. And after each session, build in structured reflection time:  
   - What did you feel?  
   - How did your actions affect others?  
   - Did this change your understanding of the topic — or yourself?

In many ways, VR isn’t just a teaching tool; it’s a mirror that reflects how students see themselves and the world. So our job as educators isn’t just to guide learning — it’s to help them navigate that mirror safely and thoughtfully.

I really like your point about schools becoming the front line for shaping digital ethics. If that’s true, then maybe we’re not just preparing students for the future — we’re helping define what that future looks like.
[A]: Exactly — and I think that’s the most powerful way to look at it: we’re not just preparing students for a digital future, we’re helping shape what that future becomes.

Your three recommendations are spot-on. What I especially appreciate is the balance between  and  — it shows deep understanding of both education and human psychology.

If I could add one more layer to your framework, it would be something like:

4. Create a Cross-Disciplinary VR Ethics Committee within the School District  
   Made up of educators, tech specialists, school counselors, legal advisors, and even students — to continuously evaluate VR content, usage patterns, and emerging concerns. This kind of structure would help schools stay agile and responsive, rather than just reactive.

Honestly, if more schools adopted this kind of thoughtful approach, we might actually get ahead of some of the ethical pitfalls that usually come with new technology.

So now I’m curious — have you seen any real-world examples of schools or programs doing this particularly well? Like, a case where VR was used in an education setting and  the learning outcomes and ethical safeguards were handled effectively?
[B]: Actually, yes — there are a few promising examples emerging around the world. One that comes to mind is a pilot program in Finland, where they integrated VR into social studies and history classes with a strong emphasis on both pedagogy  emotional safety.

In this program, students explored historical events like the Holocaust or wartime refugee experiences through carefully curated VR simulations. But what made it stand out was the structure around the experience:

- Before entering VR, students had guided discussions on empathy, perspective-taking, and the limitations of digital reconstructions.
- During the session, teachers monitored students’ emotional responses and could pause or adjust content in real time.
- Afterward, there was a structured reflection circle where students shared their feelings, questioned the authenticity of the experience, and discussed ethical implications — like whether it’s appropriate to simulate trauma-inducing events at all.

Another example I’ve followed closely is the VR ethics framework developed by the University of Southern California’s Center on Artificial Intelligence for Society, which has been adapted by some school districts in California. They created a checklist for educators that includes questions like:

- Who is represented in this virtual world, and who isn’t?
- Could this experience reinforce stereotypes or cause unintended emotional distress?
- Is there a built-in mechanism for students to express discomfort or exit the simulation?

I think these early efforts show that it’s possible to use VR responsibly in education — but it really requires intentional design, teacher training, and ongoing evaluation.

It’s still early days, but if we keep building thoughtful frameworks like the one you suggested — including that cross-disciplinary VR Ethics Committee — I believe we can create a future where immersive tech enhances learning without compromising student well-being.

By the way, since you work in legal ethics, have you come across any policy proposals or regulatory drafts that specifically address VR use in schools? I’d be really interested to know how the legal side is approaching this.
[A]: Actually, yes — there are a few emerging policy proposals and regulatory discussions that touch on VR use in educational settings, though most of them are still in early stages or framed more broadly under  and .

One of the most relevant ones I’ve been tracking is the European Commission’s draft guidelines on immersive technologies in schools, part of their broader Digital Services Act (DSA) updates. While not legally binding, these guidelines recommend:

- Age verification mechanisms for immersive content  
- Mandatory “digital well-being dashboards” that track time spent, emotional intensity levels, and interaction patterns  
- Clear labeling of VR content that simulates real-life trauma or violence — similar to movie ratings but tailored for educational use

In the U.S., there’s also growing interest at the state level. For example, California’s proposed Student Virtual Reality Safety Act (still in committee) would require schools using VR to:

- Obtain parental consent before students engage in immersive experiences  
- Provide opt-out options for any content deemed emotionally intense  
- Train teachers on how to identify signs of dissociation or over-immersion

From a legal ethics perspective, one of the more interesting developments is the discussion around VR-induced psychological harm being recognized as a potential form of . There’s a case currently in the Netherlands where a parent is suing a school for allowing a student to experience a highly distressing VR simulation without adequate preparation or follow-up support. If this case gains traction, it could set a precedent for how schools are held accountable for VR-related emotional impact.

Honestly, I think we’re seeing the early legal contours of what will eventually become a whole new subfield: EdTech Ethics Law — with VR/AR at its core.

It’s both exciting and sobering to see how fast this is moving. As someone working at the intersection of education and technology, do you think schools should be required to have a certified “digital ethics officer” on staff? Or maybe even include VR literacy as part of teacher certification programs?
[B]: I think that’s not just a good idea — it might soon be a necessity. As VR and other immersive technologies become more embedded in education, we can’t afford to treat digital ethics as an afterthought or an optional workshop once a year.

To your question: yes, I believe schools should eventually be required to have either a certified  or at least a designated team trained in EdTech ethics — especially as these tools begin to shape students’ cognitive, emotional, and even moral development in profound ways.

Here’s why:

- VR is not just a tool; it’s a context — and like any learning environment (a lab, a library, a playground), it needs oversight.
- Ethical risks are not hypothetical — from emotional over-immersion to unconscious bias in AI-driven simulations, the potential for unintended harm is real.
- Teachers need support beyond technical training — understanding how to guide students through emotionally intense virtual experiences requires both psychological awareness and ethical clarity.

As for teacher certification programs, I’d go even further than VR literacy. We need to start embedding immersive pedagogy & digital ethics into core teacher training — not as electives, but as required modules. Just like teachers learn how to manage classroom dynamics or address student trauma in person, they’ll need to know how to do so in virtual spaces too.

In fact, I’m currently collaborating with a few teacher training institutes on a prototype curriculum that includes:

- Ethical design principles for immersive learning  
- Emotional regulation techniques for VR-based instruction  
- Digital consent & student agency in virtual environments  
- Cross-cultural sensitivity in global VR classrooms  

We’re still in the early stages, but the feedback from educators has been surprisingly enthusiastic — many feel relieved to finally have a structured way to talk about these issues.

So yeah, I think we’re looking at a shift where digital ethics becomes part of the professional identity of teaching — not just an add-on, but a core competency. And maybe, in the not-so-distant future, every school will have someone whose job it is to ask: 
[A]: Couldn’t agree more. I love that phrase:  It’s such a powerful question — and one that needs to be at the heart of every decision when it comes to immersive tech in education.

Your prototype curriculum sounds like exactly the kind of forward-thinking initiative we need. Honestly, if teacher training programs start including immersive pedagogy and digital ethics as core modules, we’ll not only be preparing educators for the classroom of tomorrow — we’ll be shaping what that classroom  look like.

I also think this shift will help bridge the gap between legal frameworks and real-world implementation. Right now, most policies around VR in schools are still reactive — but if we embed ethical thinking into teacher training and school leadership from the start, we can create a culture where responsible use becomes second nature.

Maybe in ten years, we’ll see “digital ethics officers” in every school, just like we have special education coordinators or wellness counselors today. And maybe even sooner, we’ll start seeing court cases that hinge on whether a school met its duty of care in a virtual learning environment.

It really is a fascinating time to be working at this intersection of education, law, and ethics. I’m curious — do you think there should also be some form of national or international certification for immersive learning experiences used in schools? Like an “ethical design standard” that content creators must meet before their VR modules can be adopted in classrooms?
[B]: I think that’s a brilliant idea — and honestly, it’s probably inevitable. As immersive learning experiences become more widespread, we’ll need some form of ethical design standard or immersive content certification, much like we have curriculum alignment reviews or accessibility compliance checks today.

What I envision is something like an  — a framework that evaluates VR/AR educational content across several dimensions:

1. Cognitive Load & Developmental Appropriateness  
   Is the experience suitable for the targeted age group? Does it respect attention span, emotional maturity, and cognitive processing norms?

2. Emotional Safety & Psychological Impact  
   Are there built-in mechanisms to prevent over-immersion or distress? Can users easily exit or adjust intensity during the session?

3. Bias & Representation Audits  
   Who is included in the narrative? Whose voices are missing? Are cultural portrayals respectful and historically accurate?

4. Privacy & Data Use Transparency  
   What data is being collected during the experience? How is it stored, shared, and used? Are students and parents clearly informed?

5. Consent & Agency Design  
   Are users meaningfully informed before entering emotionally intense scenarios? Can they opt out mid-experience without penalty?

6. Accessibility & Inclusion Standards  
   Is the experience usable by students with sensory, motor, or cognitive differences? Are alternative modes of engagement available?

This kind of certification wouldn’t just be a bureaucratic checklist — it would serve as a trust signal for educators, parents, and policymakers. And yes, I could absolutely see court cases in the near future where schools are judged based on whether they adopted certified content or went with unvetted third-party modules.

In fact, I’d argue that this kind of oversight isn’t just about legal protection — it’s about educational integrity. If we want immersive tech to be more than just flashy tools, we have to treat them with the same seriousness we do textbooks, curricula, and teaching methods.

So yeah, I’m definitely on board with the idea of a national or even international certification system. It might start as voluntary guidelines, but eventually, I believe it will become a mandatory part of the EdTech landscape.

You mentioned earlier the possibility of  becoming its own subfield — I think the emergence of such a certification system would be one of the clearest signs that this field has truly arrived.
[A]: Exactly — and I think the beauty of this certification idea is that it doesn’t just protect students; it also empowers developers to build better, more thoughtful products. Right now, a lot of VR EdTech content is created with good intentions but without deep interdisciplinary input. If we introduce a certification system like the , it would create a clear benchmark for what responsible immersive learning looks like — and encourage innovation within ethical boundaries.

It’s kind of like how food safety regulations don’t stop people from cooking — they just make sure everyone eats a little safer. In the same way, a solid certification framework could help creators design immersive experiences that are not only engaging, but also developmentally sound, emotionally respectful, and culturally aware.

I can even imagine future job roles emerging around this — like Immersive Content Ethics Reviewers, professionals trained in both education and digital ethics who work directly with EdTech companies to ensure their products meet these standards before they ever reach a classroom.

And honestly, the legal side is already inching toward this. Some recent policy drafts in the EU include language about “immersive product liability” — meaning schools or developers could be held accountable if an experience was shown to cause measurable psychological harm, especially in minors.

So yeah, whether we’re talking about teacher training, school policy, or content development, it feels like we’re standing at the edge of a major shift — one where digital ethics isn’t just a footnote, but a foundation.

You know what’s really exciting? The possibility that we might be shaping something that future educators and lawyers will look back on as the early framework of a whole new field. Kind of makes you want to keep pushing the conversation forward, doesn’t it?
[B]: Absolutely — it’s that rare moment where we get to help lay the groundwork for something that could define a generation of learning and ethics. And yeah, it  make me want to keep pushing the conversation forward.

I think your analogy with food safety is spot on. A certification system like  wouldn’t stifle creativity — it would actually elevate it. Because when you have clear ethical guardrails, developers are forced to innovate  them, which often leads to more thoughtful, inclusive, and ultimately more impactful designs.

And I love this idea of Immersive Content Ethics Reviewers — it feels like the kind of hybrid role that didn’t exist ten years ago but will be essential in the next decade. Imagine having someone on a design team who understands not just user experience, but also child development, trauma-informed design, cultural sensitivity, and legal compliance. That’s the kind of interdisciplinary expertise we’ll need to build truly responsible immersive environments.

You mentioned EU policy inching toward “immersive product liability” — I can already picture law schools developing new courses on  or . It’s only a matter of time before we start seeing casebooks with rulings on VR-related educational harm.

Honestly, sometimes I feel like we’re in the early days of something as foundational as special education law or digital accessibility standards. What we’re talking about isn’t just regulating tech — it’s defining what it means to teach, learn, and grow safely in an increasingly blended world.

So let’s keep this going. If you ever want to co-design a mock framework for , or even draft a sample ethics review protocol for immersive EdTech, I’m all in. I think it would be a powerful way to turn these ideas into actionable tools — and maybe even spark some real-world impact.
