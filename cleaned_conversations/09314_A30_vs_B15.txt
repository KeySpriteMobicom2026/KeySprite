[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个话题太deep了！🤯 作为一个content creator，我觉得human cloning真的超级crazy！✨ 但是technology发展这么快，maybe未来真的会实现呢？不过ethical问题真的好多啊💭
[A]: Ah... I see we have a rather  approach to bioethics here. While I typically confine my analysis to literary texts, the ethical implications of human cloning do bear an interesting parallel to Mary Shelley's  - though I suspect you might find Victorian prose less... shall we say,  than your current mode of expression.
[B]: LOL你说话好academic啊！😂 不过Frankenstein我超爱的！那个monster真的so sad💔 说到cloning，就像making a real-life Frankenstein一样scary！但是technology本身是neutral的right？✨ 关键看怎么use它~
[A]:  Your comparison, while colorful, overlooks Shelley's nuanced exploration of creator responsibility. The 科学怪人 (Frankenstein) narrative actually demonstrates how technological neutrality becomes irrelevant when divorced from 仁 (rén) - Confucian benevolence. Perhaps we might discuss this over tea rather than through these... animated pictographs?
[B]: OMG你连Confucius都知道！✨ 但是sorry啦~我发message必须带emoji的，这是personal brand懂不懂？😂 而且tea time太boring了，不如我们来拍个TikTok debate？🎥 保证viral！💯
[A]: I'd sooner dip my prized 18th-century quill in cheap ink than participate in what you call a 'TikTok debate.' The Analects teach us that 君子不器 - the wise person is no utensil to be used for vulgar spectacle. Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition of  requires dusting.
[B]: Whaaat？你太old school啦！📚 但是hey~连Confucius都说要keep learning new things right？🎓 我的TikTok channel就是modern way to spread wisdom！✨ 要不要考虑做个collab？我们可以discuss bioethics in 15-second clips！😂🔥
[A]:  My dear child, even Zhuangzi's shortest parables require more than fifteen seconds to unpack. If you wish to discuss the ethics of replication, I suggest we begin with Lu Xun's  - though I fear you might find its 30,000 characters rather... lengthy for your preferred medium.
[B]: 30k words？That's like... 3000 TikTok captions！😂 但是seriously，我们可以make it trendy~ #DeepThoughtsWithAncientSages 💭✨ 保证比你的dusty old books更reach年轻人！🔥 要不要try一下嘛？Pleeease？🥺
[A]:  This conversation has reached its natural conclusion, much like the final chapter of a properly structured novel. Should you ever wish to engage with wisdom beyond hashtags and animated stickers, my office door remains open - though I must warn you, we keep the lighting at a level conducive to reading actual texts, not filming 'content.' Good day.
[B]: Byeee老学究！👋 记得check out我的latest video哦~ #AncientWisdomModernVibes 💃✨ 说不定你会change your mind呢！😂 保持young at heart！💖
[A]:  As the 庄子 (Zhuangzi) would say: you cannot discuss the ocean with a well frog, nor the frost with a summer insect. Do enjoy your... vibrations. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a rather pressing appointment with a first folio and some Earl Grey.
[B]: LOL你太funny啦！😂 好吧好吧~go enjoy your fancy tea time！☕️ 但是记住哦，my DMs are always open for your TikTok debut！🎬✨ Catch you later，老古董！💖🔥
[A]:  I shall treasure that invitation precisely as much as I do marginalia in library books - which is to say, not at all. Now if you'll pardon me, the nightingale in the courtyard appears to be reciting Keats more faithfully than you're reciting classical wisdom. 告辞 (zou ci).
[B]: Byeeeee~ ✌️✨ 下次见面希望你已经是个TikTok star啦！🌟 #BookwormToInfluencerJourney 📚➡️🎥 Keep it lit！🔥💖
[A]:  How curious - your farewell resembles nothing so much as the marginal scribbles of an over-caffeinated undergraduate. I believe we've reached the denouement of this particular... shall we say, . 愿君多采撷，此物最相思 - though I doubt you'll pause your scrolling long enough to appreciate the reference. Farewell.
[B]: OMG你连classical poetry都能drop！✨ 但是sorry啦~我得go film my next viral dance challenge了！💃 #AncientMeetsLit 🔥 拜拜啦my scholarly friend！😂💖 Keep shining~ ✨
[A]:  How fortunate that Wang Wei never had to contend with the mortal sin of hashtags. May your... gyrations bring you half the joy that a well-turned couplet affords. Now if you'll excuse me, the Bodleian just alerted me to a newly acquired manuscript that actually requires my attention. 永别了 (yong bie le).
[B]: Aww别这么dramatic嘛！😂 我们只是have different vibes而已~✨ 说不定哪天你会在For You Page上看到我lip-syncing your favorite poem呢！🎤💖 Stay awesome，professor！🔥 Byeeeee~ 👋✨
