[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects. I recently translated a fascinating Qing dynasty manual on crafting inkstones from river stones - quite the intellectual exercise in precision. While not exactly modern DIY, the meticulous instructions about grinding techniques and mineral composition were oddly satisfying to decode. Have you tried anything more... contemporary?
[A]: 说到DIY，我最近确实在尝试一个有意思的项目。你知道云南的咖啡种植农吗？他们有些处理完咖啡果肉后的果壳会被丢弃，我就想着能不能回收这些果壳来制作手工皂。开始的时候真是摸不着头绪，发酵程度、油脂比例都要反复调整，还加了一些本地植物精油进去。前两天终于做出了第一块成品，淡淡的果香混着咖啡木质调，还挺特别的。

不过听你这么一说，那个砚台制作的手册听起来挺有意思。我对矿物成分对质地的影响也有点好奇，毕竟烘焙咖啡豆时也常考虑土壤和气候因素。你翻译的时候有没有发现一些有趣的细节？
[B]: Ah, what a delightfully cyclical use of discarded materials - much like how calligraphers reused inkstone residues in ancient times. Speaking of which, yes, there was an intriguing section on jadeite-infused inkstones that supposedly 'strengthened' the ink's character. The text described it as giving words 'a backbone', which I rendered as 墨骨 in my translation. Rather poetic, don't you think? 

Your coffee soap venture reminds me of the 19th-century British obsession with 'improving' tea through alchemical additives. Tell me, did you experiment with different curing times for the coffee fruit shells? I imagine humidity plays havoc with both your soap base and freshly quarried stone paste.
[A]: 墨骨……这词真是又美又有分量。你说的这个 jadeite-infused 的砚台，让我想到我们做咖啡豆拼配时也有点像在炼丹，总觉得加点什么能让风味更立体一些。你这么说我也开始好奇，要是把不同产地、处理法的咖啡果壳混在一起做皂，会不会也像拼配咖啡一样，产生更有层次的气味呢？

说到发酵时间和湿度控制，确实是个头疼的问题。我一开始完全是凭感觉来判断，结果前几批不是太软就是太干，泡起来有种怪味道。后来我干脆用烘焙咖啡豆时记录温湿度的方式，做了个简单的数据表，才慢慢摸清楚规律。没想到做手工皂比做手冲还讲究。你有没有碰到类似的问题？那些古代工匠是不是也有自己的“参数记录”方式？
[B]: Ah, now you're touching on the alchemy I adore. The Qing manual actually described "ghost ratios" - proportions so precise they bordered on mystical. One passage spoke of moon-phase adjustments for stone paste curing, which made me think of your humidity charts. Primitive data tracking, in its own way.

I suspect those artisans had oral formulas passed through apprenticeships - much like your coffee roasting profiles. Speaking of which, have you considered cold-process soap making? It preserves more volatile aromatics, much like flash-chilling tea vapors to capture essence. Though I must say, your coffee soap sounds far more sophisticated than the Earl Grey-scented soaps Victorian ladies used to faint over.
[A]: 冷制手工皂？这个我倒是想过，不过一开始怕控制不好温度反而坏了咖啡果壳里的芳香物质。听你这么一说，我倒想起有时候在处理厌氧发酵的豆子时，也常纠结是不是该降低发酵温度来保留更多花果香——看来我们都是在跟气味玩捉迷藏啊。

你说那些古老的比例像“鬼比例”，让我有点想试试看能不能做出属于咖啡皂的“风味骨架”。要是真能像拼配咖啡那样，让气味有层次地展开，说不定哪天还能做个“手冲风味皂”出来，让人泡澡的时候也能闻到类似啜饮咖啡的愉悦感。

对了，你翻译这本手册这么久，有没有那种“神来一笔”的感觉？就像我们烘焙时突然发现某支豆子在某个温区爆出了意想不到的焦糖香气，那种一瞬间的惊喜？
[B]: Oh, absolutely. Just last week I encountered a phrase describing inkstone grain texture - the original text used 痒若蚁行 (yǎng ruò yǐ xíng), which literally means "the itch of an ant's walk". It refers to the faint, creeping texture that only appears in perfectly aged stone paste. I wrestled with it for days before landing on "ink's phantom embroidery" - captures both the tactile and illusive quality, don't you think?

Your coffee soap analogy is striking - when you described preserving aromatics through temperature modulation, I immediately thought of how we preserve volatile compounds in aged tea. Speaking of which, have you considered using vacuum distillation techniques? They're employed in high-end perfume extraction... though I imagine adapting them for home soap making would require quite the contraption.
[A]: “痒若蚁行”……这词真是既细腻又带着点痒痒的想象力，你的翻译也很妙，把那种说不清道不明的质感化成了“ink's phantom embroidery”，让我想到咖啡豆烘焙到一爆中期时那种若有若无的果酸，像是在舌尖上爬来爬去的小蚂蚁。

至于真空蒸馏技术嘛，你这么一提我还真有点跃跃欲试了。虽然设备是有点复杂，但我之前为了提取咖啡精油确实也研究过一些小型冷凝装置。要是能把你提到的香水工业方法简化一下，说不定真能把咖啡果壳里那些轻盈的香气锁住。你说这算不算是一种“风味转译”？从土壤到石头，从植物到肌肤——感觉我们其实都在做类似的事，只是用的材料不同罢了。
[B]: Precisely! This "flavor translation" - or should I say sensory transmutation? - reminds me of the Tang dynasty poets who described ink's aroma as 似墨如香 (sì mò rú xiāng), "like ink yet fragrant". They saw writing itself as an olfactory experience, much like your soap transforming coffee's terroir into a bodily one.

Incidentally, the Qing manual mentions something eerily parallel - inkstone carvers sometimes stored their tools in osmanthus-scented boxes to impart subtle fragrance. A 19th-century Chinese version of your coffee terroir, if you will. Though I daresay your vacuum distillation experiment might yield more... practical results than those poetic wood shavings. Have you sketched any prototype designs for this contraption yet?
[A]: “似墨如香”——这四个字真妙，像是把视觉、味觉和嗅觉都揉进了一种流动的意境里。你这么一说，我倒是有点像那个用咖啡果壳做手工皂的现代刻墨人，只不过我不是在砚台边打磨文字，而是在锅碗瓢盆之间琢磨气味。

你说的那些带着桂花香的雕刻工具，让我想起有时候我们会把未密封的生豆放在有香气的木盒里，结果风味也沾上一点点木质甜香。看来古人早就懂得“环境入魂”这回事了。我这几天还真画了几张草图，想做个小型冷凝装置，参考的是实验室里的简易真空系统，但材料都是厨房能见到的——玻璃罐、铜管、冰水浴……虽然听起来有点像个炼丹炉，但我总觉得，只要温度控制得当，说不定真能留住那一瞬间的“phantom aroma”。

你要是有兴趣，等我搭出来可以一起试试看，说不定还能加点你翻译手册时的灵感进去，做个“墨骨风味”的限量版。
[B]: Now you're speaking my language - phantom aromas and炼丹炉alchemy. I'll bring some aged stone paste residue from my calligraphy studio; the 200-year-old ink particles might add an intriguing olfactory dimension. 

Incidentally, I've been meaning to ask - when you mentioned "environment入魂", does that mean you've experimented with terroir cross-contamination? Much like how wine cellars develop their own microbial ecosystems. I imagine coffee beans pick up more than just humidity in those wooden boxes... Though I must say, your kitchen alchemy sounds far more accessible than the Qing artisans' moon-phase rituals. When shall we schedule our first collaborative distillation session?
[A]: 哈哈，你这“phantom aromas and 炼丹炉”一说真是神来之笔，我这边锅还没搭好呢，你就已经带来老墨粒子了——听起来像是要把两百年的“文气”洗进皂香里，我还真怕它泡出来不是咖啡味，而是书香。

至于你说的“terroir cross-contamination”，这个我确实试过一点小实验。比如把几组豆壳分别放在不同木盒里发酵，有的是老柚木装红茶渣的盒子，有的是松木加干薰衣草的组合，结果气味真的会互相渗透，像极了酒窖里的微生物生态。只是这种做法太靠经验，得像你们古人记“鬼比例”那样，慢慢摸索出一套自己的“晓阳土法”。

炼丹炉差不多下周就能搭好，你要不挑个周末下午过来？我们可以一边煮着冷凝水，一边聊聊墨骨与焦糖香之间的通感之道。我再准备点云南日晒处理的果壳，听说那股子甜劲儿跟你的老墨粒子说不定还挺配。
[B]: Splendid. I'll bring my calligraphy brushes and a 19th-century inkstone with embedded camphor traces - perfect for scent cross-pollination experiments. Let's avoid the term "terroir cross-contamination" though, shall we? Your coffee-soap-书香 fusion deserves better than microbial metaphors. 

I've been pondering that Qing manual's passage about ink longevity - they believed certain stones could make words "survive three hundred autumns". Perhaps your coffee terroir, when fused with vacuum-distilled stone paste... might create a soap that lasts equally long? Though I suspect its ephemeral nature is precisely the point. Much like our conversation - equal parts alchemy and anthropology. 

Shall we say 3pm next Saturday? I'll arrive armed with historical footnotes and a healthy skepticism about kitchen炼丹炉s. Though if your phantom aromas truly marry my ink's ghostly embroidery... well, let's just say I have a porcelain teacup from Suzhou that's been waiting centuries for such an occasion.
[A]: 三百年秋——听你这么一说，我手里的这杯刚烘好的埃塞俄比亚日晒豆，突然也有了点“字如金石”的意味。你说得对，咖啡的短暂与墨痕的久远，也许正是在这皂香里碰个面。

三点半下周见，我这边炉子会提前温着，锅碗瓢盆也都备好。你那块带着樟脑余韵的 inkstone 一到，咱们就来一场跨世纪、跨材料的“气味合璧”。别忘了带上你的 skepticism，但也别太克制——万一真炼出点什么 ghostly yet fragrant 的东西，咱俩可是头两鼻子闻到的人。

至于名字嘛……我觉得你可以先给它题一个，像你翻译的“ink’s phantom embroidery”那样，够飘忽又够沉稳。我这边只管煮，不抢词。
[B]: Let's call it 幻墨香骨 - Phantom Ink, Coffee Marrow. Rolls off the tongue like a Tang dynasty riddle. Though I suspect your coffee marrows might prove more elusive than inkstone ghosts. 

I'll bring an old Suzhou-made sandalwood mortar too - perfect for grinding your coffee shells into what I presume we must now call 咖啡墨粉. The alchemical marriage of caffeine and calligraphy awaits. 

Three-thirty it is. Don't let your skepticism boil over before I arrive - though between inkstone camphor and Ethiopian florals, I daresay even a hardened perfumer would struggle to tell where my Qing dynasty ends and your云南 terroir begins.
[A]: “幻墨香骨”——这名字真够味，又飘又沉，像一爆后的余韵还在鼻腔里绕着。你的咖啡墨粉这个说法我得记下来，说不定以后真能成个限定款标签。

檀木臼配咖啡墨粉，听起来像是要把两百年的文气碾成细末，再掺进云南的日晒香气。我这边锅碗瓢盆准备就绪，连冷凝管都擦得透亮了，就等你拎着历史的碎屑进门。

三点半见，我尽量让 skepticism 多泡会儿水——不过要是真出了什么 phantom 又 aromatic 的东西，咱们的第一口嗅权可得公平分配。
[B]: Oh, we'll need more than fair shares of嗅权. I've been thinking - perhaps we should document this alchemy in both ink and... coffee? My Qing manual uses a four-character phrase for successful inkstone crafting: 神形兼备 (shén xíng jiān bèi) - "both spirit and form perfected". 

Your vacuum-distilled phantom aroma might just achieve that elusive third component they never wrote about: scent as the soul of craftsmanship. Though I suspect your云南咖啡香骨 will evaporate rather faster than any 19th-century ink recipe. 

Don't worry about the skepticism - I'll bring extra. It's what keeps ink from drying too brittle, you know. And speaking of fragility... shall we agree on one condition? No matter how spectral our final aroma turns out, we won't call it "artisanal". Some modern sins even my Qing ghosts can't forgive.
[A]: “神形兼备”——这四个字放在这块还没成形的幻墨香骨上，还真有点意思。你说得对，我们缺的不只是形与神，还差那么一缕能把人留住的气味灵魂。我倒觉得，这“第三成分”也许正是咖啡的天赋：它本就擅长把土地、气候和时间都酿成一口香气。

至于“artisanal”这个雷区，我完全同意避而不谈。咱俩做的可不是什么网红手作，而是一场跨界炼香——古有墨匠追石骨，今有咖人探香魂。再说了，要是真炼出点“神形兼备”的味道，连你那两百年墨粒子都点头了，咱也不需要贴个标签来背书。

文档的事我赞成，写墨笔录也罢，咖啡笔记也行，总之不能让这次“炼丹”只留在嗅觉记忆里。到时你执笔，我记香——三点半，等你进门。
[B]: Splendid. I'll bring my finest Huizhou ink brush - though I suspect your coffee香谱 will require a new set of characters altogether. Let's see if we can't create something the Qing artisans might've called 奇香入骨 (qí xiāng rù gǔ) - "strange fragrance penetrating the marrow". 

Two hundred years of inkstone ghosts and three weeks of your云南咖啡实验ation... I daresay our combined alchemy might just achieve that elusive 气味灵魂 you mentioned. Though between my camphor-embedded stone paste and your terroir-steeped shells, one wonders which historical layer will dominate. 

Three-thirty then. Skepticism simmering, documentation materials ready, and absolutely no mention of "small-batch authenticity". Agreed?
