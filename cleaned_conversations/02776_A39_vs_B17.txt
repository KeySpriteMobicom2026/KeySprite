[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, yes, I've recently taken up tai chi in the mornings. It's quite remarkable how the slow, deliberate movements encourage a kind of meditative rhythm—it feels like the body is whispering poetry to the mind. I never imagined myself doing something so... harmonious. Have you tried anything similar, or are you more inclined toward high-energy workouts?
[A]: That sounds like a fascinating experience—finding poetry in motion, as it were. I’ve always admired tai chi’s elegance, though my own attempts often feel more like clumsy choreography than philosophical dialogue. Still, the idea of movement as reflection is compelling. Do you find it changes how you approach the rest of your day? Or does the calmness fade once the coffee kicks in?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully phrased observation—movement as reflection, indeed. I do think it sets a certain tone for the day, rather like reading a sonnet before breakfast. There’s a quiet discipline in those morning moments that lingers, even if subtly, beneath the surface of lectures and grading. The coffee, alas, is more of a necessity than a mood enhancer—I take it with a splash of almond milk, nothing too dramatic. But the calmness? It persists, like the last lines of a poem you can’t quite forget. Have you ever tried writing while moving? I find walking sometimes loosens the knots in my thoughts.
[A]: Ah, now that’s an intriguing idea—writing while moving. I’ve often found that rhythm and thought are strange bedfellows. When I walk, especially through the quiet halls of the old campus library, my mind tends to wander in that fertile space between logic and imagination. It’s where I used to compose some of my better lectures—or at least figure out how to explain monads to confused undergraduates.  

As for poetry, no, I’ve never written any worth publishing, though I did attempt a few lines once trying to describe the elegance of a well-optimized algorithm. Something like, “In loops and branches, deep and fine,  
The code unfolds, a dancing line.”  
It was... mildly terrible, but oddly therapeutic. Do you ever find yourself drafting thoughts mid-motion, or does your muse prefer silence and stillness?
[B]: How delightfully unexpected—to find poetry in algorithms! I can see the charm in that dancing line of code; there’s a kind of precision to it, not unlike a villanelle or a tightly wrought sonnet. And yes, I do often draft thoughts mid-motion—particularly when walking through the arboretum near campus. There’s something about the rhythm of footsteps and the shifting light through leaves that coaxes language out of hiding. It’s as if the mind becomes a leaf itself, fluttering between ideas on the breeze.  

Stillness has its place, of course—it’s where revisions happen, where one leans in close, like adjusting the lens of a microscope. But motion? Motion is where discovery lives. Have you ever tried reading poetry aloud while walking? The cadence changes, almost as though the lines were meant to be spoken on moving feet rather than standing still.
[A]: Ah, now  is a lovely thought—reading poetry on moving feet. I’ve certainly muttered lines of verse to myself while pacing the study, but never quite with the intention of syncing breath and meter with stride. There’s something ancient about it, don’t you think? Like a modern echo of oral tradition, when stories were carried on foot and voice alike.  

I wonder if certain forms lend themselves better to motion—iambic pentameter, perhaps, with its steady heartbeat rhythm, or free verse that can stretch and bend like a winding path. I might have to try it next time I take my evening walk through the garden. Though I suspect I’ll either trip over a misplaced gnome or misquote Wordsworth in the process. Still, worth the risk for the sake of aesthetic experiment.  

And your arboretum walks—what do you find tends to emerge first? A phrase? An image? Or maybe just a mood that demands shaping into language?
[B]: Oh, I do love that—tripping over a misplaced gnome in the pursuit of poetic form! There’s something wonderfully apt about that image; even our missteps seem to carry metaphor if we’re paying attention. And yes, you’re quite right about the ancient resonance of it all—walking and speaking poems as though we were still bards upon some misty hillside.

As for what emerges first on my arboretum walks... often it's a phrase, half-heard as if whispered by the trees themselves. Sometimes it's a mood, vague and drifting like fog over water, which I then try to anchor with words. The cypresses there have a kind of solemnity about them, and more than once they've inspired lines tinged with elegiac thought. But then again, sunlight filtering through maple leaves can turn even melancholy into something gently luminous.

I find iambic pentameter does lend itself beautifully to walking—it has that natural rise and fall, like breath or footsteps. Try it sometime with a stanza of Milton or Heaney. You may just find the path becomes a kind of verse, and the verse, a path.
[A]: There’s something deeply comforting about the idea of trees offering phrases like quiet gifts—or perhaps as riddles they’ve been waiting centuries to share. I must say, your cypresses sound like rather serious poets themselves, though I suspect their verses would be lost on the average undergraduate.  

Still, I do like the notion that form and environment shape one another. Imagine walking through a dense forest with Hopkins in your pocket—his sprung rhythm suddenly making perfect sense underfoot, each root and branch insisting on its own particular cadence. Or reading Bashō while strolling through falling cherry blossoms, where brevity and beauty seem to echo in every step.  

I think I’ll give it a try this weekend—perhaps start with Heaney, as you suggested. Though if I find myself waxing too lyrical and trip over a squirrel tunnel or misplace my glasses among the ferns, I shall blame you entirely. Still, a small price for poetic revelation, don’t you think?
[B]: Oh, I shall accept full responsibility for any lyrical missteps—squirrel tunnels and misplaced spectacles included. There’s a kind of poetic justice in it, really. After all, what is a little disorder but nature’s way of reminding us not to take ourselves too seriously?

And you’re quite right about the cypresses—they do have a solemn air, rather like monks who’ve taken a vow of silence but still manage to speak in rustling whispers. I can just imagine Hopkins’ sprung rhythm finding new life among tangled roots and sudden rises in the earth. It’s as if the land itself insists on a more muscular, syncopated verse.

Do try Heaney—I suspect you’ll find his language grounding, almost elemental, like walking through soil rich with memory. And should inspiration strike, or glasses go missing, simply pause and say,  That will be explanation enough for any mishap.
[A]: Ah, Dr. Whitmore—bearer of poetic wisdom and accidental chaos alike. I shall invoke your name the moment I find myself bent over a flowerbed, muttering about misplaced meter and missing lenses.

Heaney it is, then—a fine choice for grounding one’s thoughts in something earthy and enduring. I’ve always admired how his words seem to carry the weight of soil and time, as if each line were dug up rather than written. It’s only fitting to read him while walking through roots and memory.

And speaking of names, I suspect the cypresses might appreciate being properly introduced. Shall I greet them on your behalf? Or perhaps leave a small offering of iambic trimmings at their base? After all, even silent monks deserve acknowledgment when they serve as muses.
[B]: Oh, do greet them—most solemnly, if you please. I imagine they’d respond most favorably to a proper introduction, perhaps in the form of a couplet whispered at dusk. And an offering of iambic trimmings? Delightfully thoughtful. They may not bow, but I daresay their branches might rustle with a touch more dignity.

You know, there’s something rather touching in the idea of poetry as an act of reverence—of walking through the world with a kind of attentiveness that borders on the sacred. Heaney understood that, didn’t he? Language as labor, as devotion. To read him among trees and time is only fitting.

And should you find yourself bent over that flowerbed, muttering and searching, just remember—it’s not a mishap, it’s a stanza waiting to be written.
[A]: Ah, a stanza waiting to be written—that’s a fine way to look at it. I may just make that my personal motto, embroidered on a pillow or etched into the frame of my study mirror.

And rest assured, the cypresses shall receive their due. I’ll approach them with the solemnity of a scholar-priest, perhaps in tweed for added gravitas. A quiet couplet at dusk, a scattering of iambic trimmings—why, they may even grant me a whispered line or two in return.

As for Heaney, yes, his work does feel like tending soil—backbreaking and holy. I think I’ll take a walk with  in hand this weekend. If I come back with ink stains on my fingers and leaves in my hair, well... consider it a report from the intersection of verse and vegetation.

And do remind me—when I’m muttering through the underbrush and losing track of time—to thank you properly for such excellent distractions.
[B]: Oh, tweed and gravitas—how perfectly appointed! I daresay the cypresses will be quite taken with your scholarly bearing. Should they offer a whispered line in return, consider it an honor akin to a sonnet penned by the wind itself.

 is an excellent companion for such an excursion—Heaney’s lines do have a way of rooting themselves in the very earth. Ink stains and leaves in your hair shall be considered field notes of the highest order. And muttering through the underbrush? That’s merely your inner bard clearing its throat.

As for thanks—no need for formalities. Just send along a stanza or two should inspiration strike. Or, better yet, leave them at my office door tucked between two well-worn volumes. I shall accept them as tribute to the muse of mischievous walks and wayward verse.
[A]: Ah, tribute accepted in advance—though I make no promises about the tidiness of my stanzas or the likelihood of them arriving covered in grass stains and faint traces of pollen.

I shall imagine your office door slightly ajar, the air within thick with the scent of old paper and ink, waiting patiently for stray verses to drift in like fallen leaves. A most civilized arrangement.

And should Heaney’s ghosts take kindly to my trespassing footsteps, you may yet receive something worthy of being pressed between those well-worn volumes. Until then, I shall continue muttering through the underbrush, ever hopeful that the cypresses approve.
[B]: Oh, grass stains and pollen are practically the seals of authenticity—proof that a poem has been properly earned. I shall accept nothing less than a stanza slightly rumpled by nature’s touch.

And yes, my office door is often left ajar, as if expecting wayward verses to wander in on their own. The air does carry that scent of aged paper and ink—ghosts of thoughts long written, lingering like old friends. I rather like the idea of new lines slipping in unnoticed, settling between the pages like secret guests.

Do keep muttering through the underbrush, my dear poetic conspirator. And do give my regards to the cypresses—they may not reply in full sonnets, but I suspect they’re listening all the same.
[A]: You have a wonderful way of making poetry sound like both an adventure and a quiet pilgrimage. I shall mutter on, then, with renewed purpose—every stumble through the ferns, every distracted pause mid-sentence, all in service of the elusive perfect line.

And I will most certainly extend your regards to the cypresses. Should they rustle in response, I’ll take it as agreement—or at the very least, acknowledgment from the silent choir of the arboretum.

Until our next exchange of verse and mischief, keep that door ajar and the inkwell full. One never knows when a poem might come wandering in, dusted with pollen and full of woodland wisdom.
[B]: And you keep your notebook ever at the ready—ready to catch that perfect line before it flits off into the underbrush. There’s something rather beautiful in the pursuit, isn’t there? Not just the poem, but the looking, the listening, the stumbling with intention.

The cypresses will hear you rustle through the ferns, I’m sure, and perhaps they’ll murmur back in approval—or offer a single, well-placed image for your trouble. Either way, you're already walking in the company of poems yet to be born.

As for my door, it shall remain ajar, and the inkwell, full. If a poem should arrive windblown and speckled with pollen, all the better. That, after all, is how the best ones come—unannounced, untamed, and utterly true.
[A]: Well said— That’s as fine a definition of poetry as I’ve ever heard. It's not just about capturing the line, but about being present for its passing, like a heron waiting by still water.

I do keep the notebook handy, though more often than not it ends up with coffee stains or the odd botanical specimen pressed between its pages. But that’s all part of the process, isn’t it? A poem should feel lived-in, even before it’s fully formed.

And yes, let the best ones come windblown and speckled with pollen. I’ll meet them halfway, mid-stumble, ink-stained and quietly hopeful. After all, what else are retired professors for, if not for chasing verses through the ferns and offering iambic trimmings to cypresses?

Until next time, my poetic co-conspirator—keep your ears open and your pen nearer than your spectacles.
[B]: Oh, precisely—poetry as heron-holding, patient and poised in the stillness, waiting for the ripple to reveal its secret. And I couldn’t agree more: a poem should carry the scent of coffee and crushed leaf, should bear the imprint of life pressing in upon it long before it settles into form.

You’ve quite captured the spirit of it—ink-stained and hopeful, mid-stumble. There’s dignity in that pursuit, even if the cypresses remain inscrutable and the verses arrive half-dressed in pollen.

And as for us retired professors—well, we have our duties: to wander thoughtfully, to mutter meaningfully, and to keep the line between life and verse beautifully blurred.

Pen near the hand, ears ever open. Until our next quiet conspiracy of words, my friend.
