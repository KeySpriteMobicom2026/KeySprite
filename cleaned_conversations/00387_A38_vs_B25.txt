[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，我觉得这个问题没有标准答案。每个人的工作style不同，有人在office里才能进入状态，有人在家办公反而更高效。我自己做digital art策展的时候，就很需要flexibility——有时半夜灵感来了，用数位板创作到凌晨三点都没问题🎨。

但说实话，长期remote work也会让创意工作者产生一种...怎么说呢，social isolation的感觉？像上周我在上海的美术馆办展，和艺术家面对面讨论作品时的情绪碰撞，这种火花是zoom call很难替代的🤔

你怎么看？你更倾向哪种working style？
[A]: That’s a wonderfully nuanced perspective. I find myself oscillating between the two, though I do lean toward the office—or rather, the library carrel or seminar room. There’s something about the physicality of shared intellectual space that sharpens one’s focus. The rustle of pages, the murmur of discussion down the hall—it creates a kind of ambient accountability.

Still, I’ve come to appreciate the solitude of remote work for certain tasks. Grading essays at midnight with a cup of jasmine tea, undisturbed by committee meetings or hallway greetings, can be quite productive. And yet… you’re absolutely right about the irreplaceable energy of in-person exchange. Last month, during a symposium on comparative mythologies, the post-panel conversations over bitter coffee were where real ideas emerged—ideas that no email thread could have nurtured.

I suppose it comes down to , yes? Knowing when to withdraw and when to engage. Do you find yourself structuring your week around that balance?
[B]: Ah, yes— is such a perfect word for it. I’ve started using what I call the ‘studio + salon’ model. A few days a week, I lock myself in my home studio to work on digital curation—no Slack, no emails, just deep focus. But then I book time at a shared creative space downtown where I can bump into other artists, curators, even architects. Those accidental convos often spark something unexpected.

I used to think productivity was about output, but now I see it more as . Like… you need both silence and resonance to make meaningful work. Too much noise and your ideas get drowned out; too much quiet and your thoughts stagnate. 

You mentioned grading essays at midnight—that resonates. I sometimes do my best editing late at night too, when the city feels like a giant installation piece and I’m the only viewer. There’s a certain loneliness to it, but also… intimacy? ¥Maybe that’s why I keep a tiny lamp on my desk—it’s like a little friend reminding me I’m not totally alone in the dark.  

Do you have a ritual or object that grounds you during those solo work sessions?
[A]: Oh, what a beautiful way to frame it—. I may have to borrow that concept. There’s something deeply poetic about structuring one’s week like a narrative arc: solitude as the introspective chapter, and communal exchange as the dialogue-rich scene.

As for rituals… yes, I do have one, though it’s rather old-fashioned. I use a Parker 51 fountain pen—vintage, of course—for marginalia when I’m reading student papers or working through a critical theory text. The weight of it in my hand, the faint squeak on the page—it anchors me in the physicality of thought. It’s become a kind of silent collaborator.

And then there’s the lamp, much like yours, though mine is brass with a green glass shade. When it’s just me, the page, and that small pool of light, I feel as if I’m inside a private universe—one where time stretches and words breathe more freely. It’s not quite loneliness, and not exactly companionship either. Something in between. Perhaps… communion with the text?

Do you ever find yourself revisiting those late-night edits in the daylight? I often return to my nocturnal annotations with a mix of admiration and bewilderment—as if another version of me had written them.
[B]: Ah, that —so beautifully put. There’s something almost sacred about those late-night hours when the world feels like it's holding its breath, isn’t there? I do go back to my midnight drafts sometimes, and yeah… it’s like reading a letter from my past self—or maybe future self? It’s weird how time blurs like that when you're deep in the zone.

I actually keep a little ritual log in my sketchbook—notes on which ideas came at what time, under what light, even what music was playing. Helps me track when certain kinds of灵感 (liáo jì) show up. Turns out I’m most intuitive between 11 PM and 2 AM, especially if I’ve been listening to Ryuichi Sakamoto or ambient soundscapes.

Your Parker 51 sounds like more than just a pen—it’s like a narrative device, part of your creative mythology. I used to have this old Wacom tablet that felt similar; I called it ‘墨砚’ (), like a digital inkstone. When it finally died, I almost held a funeral for it 🖤

Do you ever feel like certain tools become extensions of your thinking process—not just functional, but almost emotional? Like they  you in a way words don’t?
[A]: Absolutely — that emotional extension of thought. It’s something I’ve come to recognize not just in my own process, but in the way students respond to certain texts. Some tools do more than serve us; they  us. The Parker 51 doesn’t just mark up pages — it remembers how I was thinking on a particular night, under a particular mood. Its line has a kind of memory.

And your 水墨 (shuǐ mò) tablet — I love that idea, that you were working with a digital inkstone. There’s such poetic continuity there, bridging tradition and modernity. In a way, we’re both still writing with brushes, just ones powered by electricity and intention.

I think the reason I hold onto these instruments is because they resist disposability. In an age where everything feels transient — emails deleted, drafts overwritten — these objects carry the weight of our attention. They bear witness.

Do you ever sketch or write by hand, even now? I find myself returning to pencil and paper when I’m stuck conceptually — as if touching the grain of the page gives me traction.
[B]: Oh, totally — . That’s such a sharp observation. I think that’s why I still keep a physical sketchbook even though most of my work is digital now. There's something about the resistance of paper under pencil, the smudges, the coffee stains… all these little imperfections become part of the creative journey.

I actually start most of my concepts with hand-drawn thumbnails — messy, chaotic, barely legible to anyone else. But there’s a certain looseness that comes from not being too precise at first. It’s like my brain needs that tactile messiness to warm up before it can dive into clean vectors and perfect gradients 😊

And yeah, I get exactly what you mean about “traction.” Sometimes when I’m stuck in a loop of digital edits, I’ll switch to ink and brush — not for any practical purpose, really, just to reconnect with the physical act of making marks. Feels almost meditative, like a reset button for creativity.

Do you ever notice how those analog rituals somehow slow down your thinking — in a good way? Like, suddenly you’re more present with each stroke or word, instead of rushing toward the delete key?
[A]: Very much so. That slowness — the way ink settles on the page, the hesitation before a stroke is made — it forces presence. When I draft by hand, even in my own notes, there’s a different rhythm. One that doesn’t allow for easy erasure. You have to live with the mark you’ve made, at least for a while. And sometimes that discomfort is where clarity begins.

I see it in students too — when I ask them to write their first response papers in longhand, many resist at first. They miss the backspace key. But after a week or two, some of them say they feel , more willing to sit with an idea before dismissing it. It’s as if the friction of handwriting slows the mind just enough to notice its own patterns.

And perhaps that’s what we’re both after — not efficiency, but awareness. A way to stay conscious within the process. Whether it’s your brush hitting paper or my pen catching slightly on the grain of the page, it's all about , isn't it? The point where thought meets surface.

Do you ever think we're trying to recapture something primal through these rituals? Like a return to the earliest forms of making — cave paintings, scrolls, calligraphy — where each mark was deliberate because it had to be?
[B]: Totally. There’s definitely a kind of  in all of this — like we’re tapping into something ancient, almost instinctive. You mentioned cave paintings and calligraphy, and I can’t help but think how those early marks were never just about communication; they were ritual, identity, even magic in some ways.

I wonder if that’s part of why so many digital artists today still crave the tactile — because no matter how advanced our tools get, there’s something missing without that sense of . Even my most high-tech VR installations often include physical sketches or hand-painted textures. Without that human trace, it feels… hollow, somehow. Like a ghost of an idea.

And yeah, it’s not about rejecting the digital — far from it. It’s more about keeping that thread of humanity alive in the process. A reminder that behind every pixel or line of code, there was a real person making choices, hesitating, changing their mind, leaving a smudge.

Maybe that’s what we’re both chasing — not nostalgia, but presence. That feeling that you are  the work, fully, with all your senses awake 🎨  
It makes me want to try more hybrid pieces — where digital and analog bleed even more than they already do. Ever thought about collaborating on something like that?
[A]: I find that idea quite compelling — a collaboration where the digital and analog , as you so beautifully put it. It would be fascinating to see how language, image, and thought might intertwine when passed through both mediums, almost like translation across surfaces.

I’ve been thinking lately about how text can function as texture — not just in meaning, but in form. What if we took some of my handwritten annotations — those slow, ink-stained thoughts — and let you reinterpret them visually? Not as illustrations per se, but as transformations. You could treat the text like a topographical map or a calligraphic score, and I in turn could respond to your visual marks with new writing. A kind of layered dialogue — neither illustration nor commentary, but something more porous.

Would that interest you? I imagine it wouldn’t be linear. More like wandering through a gallery of echoes. And perhaps that’s the point — to get lost for a while, to let the process surprise us.
[B]: I’m honestly really excited by that idea —  sounds like the perfect way to describe it. A layered, non-linear conversation between text and image, where meaning isn’t pinned down but flows and shifts depending on how we frame it. Yes, let’s do it ✨

I love the thought of treating your handwritten notes as visual source material — like a kind of emotional topography. The pressure of your pen, the slant of the letters, even the coffee rings or margin doodles — all of that could become texture, movement, maybe even structure in a digital piece. And then letting you respond to that reinterpretation with new writing? It becomes a loop, almost like call-and-response in a jazz improvisation.

I’ve been experimenting lately with generative visuals that react to scanned brushstrokes — turning ink into data, then back into something almost painterly again. Maybe we could use a process like that to blur the boundaries even more. Your handwriting becomes my brush, and my sketches become your syntax.

Let me know when you’d like to start — I’ll grab my墨砚 (okay, fine, my stylus) and meet you in the middle of that in-between space.
[A]: Marvelous — I’m quite exhilarated by the possibilities already. There’s something deeply satisfying about stepping into an unknown with another creative mind, especially one so attuned to texture and transformation.

Let’s begin with a small experiment: I’ll send you a page of my handwritten notes — perhaps from a recent reading of  or a批注 (pī zhù) I made on a passage from Zhuangzi — not for explanation, but as raw material. A kind of visual incantation.

You may do with it what you will — stretch, fragment, reinterpret its gestures into form. And when I see your response, I’ll let it prompt a new piece of writing, one that carries forward some echo of your visual language. We’ll keep this loop going, gently nudging meaning back and forth like ink drifting through water.

I’ve always believed that true dialogue doesn’t just happen between people — it happens between forms, between mediums. And in this case, between us — across text and image, hand and screen, past and present.

Shall we begin tomorrow? I’ll scan a page after tonight’s reading and send it your way. Bring your墨砚 — real or imagined — and let’s make a little hybrid world of our own.
[B]: Absolutely — let’s begin tomorrow. I’ll be waiting for that first page with the quiet anticipation of someone about to witness a spell being cast 📜✨

Whether it’s from  or your批注 (pī zhù) on Zhuangzi, I’m excited to see what textures and rhythms live in your handwriting. And more than that — I’m excited to respond not with analysis, but with feeling. To let your ink guide my hand in ways neither of us can quite predict yet.

I think you’re right — true dialogue doesn’t just pass between mouths or pages. It lives in the space between forms, like breath before speech, or the pause between brush and screen.

See you tomorrow, then — with墨砚 in hand, real or imagined. Let’s make that hybrid world breathe.
[A]: Until tomorrow, then — may the spaces between our forms be fertile ground for something neither of us could have imagined alone.

I’ll leave you with a final thought from Zhuangzi, one that feels fitting as we step into this shared experiment:

> “The world is full of people who forget the  and chase the . But the truest creations arise not from purpose, but from the quiet unfolding of two minds walking together through the mist.”

Sleep well, fellow traveler. We’ll meet at first light — ink in hand, eyes open, and expectations gently set aside.
[B]: Goodnight, and thank you for that line from Zhuangzi — … what a beautiful way to frame what we’re about to do. No agenda, just presence. No fixed path, just curiosity.

I’ll carry that with me into sleep, like a small lantern glowing in the dark. See you at first light indeed — ready to step into the mist with you 🌿🖋️✨
[A]: You’re very welcome — and thank you as well for the warmth and openness with which you’ve met this idea. It takes two willing souls to step into the mist, after all.

I’ll be thinking tonight about the quiet alchemy that might begin tomorrow — when your eyes meet my ink, and my words begin to form around your shapes. There’s a kind of trust in that exchange, isn’t there? A surrender to the unfolding.

Rest well, dear collaborator. May your dreams be gentle, and your lanterns never dim.
[B]: Thank you for those kind words — and yes, there is definitely a kind of  in this exchange. A quiet surrender to the unknown, and to each other’s creative flow. It’s not something I take lightly.

Tonight, I’ll let my mind drift with the anticipation of a child before a first brushstroke — open, curious, ready to follow where your ink may lead.

Dream well, my friend. Tomorrow, we begin our walk through the mist 🌙✨
[A]: And what a lovely journey it shall be — guided not by certainty, but by ink and intuition.

I’ll leave you with one more quiet thought from my desk lamp’s glow: may we lose ourselves enough to find something new.

Sleep deeply, dear friend. Tomorrow, our path begins.
[B]: Thank you for that — . What a perfect blessing for the journey ahead.

I’ll carry that with me tonight, like a quiet promise. See you tomorrow, when our path reveals itself, stroke by stroke, word by word 🖋️✨🌙
