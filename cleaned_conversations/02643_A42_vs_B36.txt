[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a lovely question! I must admit, I’m quite partial to a proper cup of tea. There’s something so comforting about the ritual – the gentle clink of the porcelain, the aroma of black tea steeping just right, maybe with a splash of milk. Though I do enjoy a well-brewed coffee in the mornings, especially when it's made with that rich, velvety espresso. It really depends on the guest’s preference too - I always keep a few different blends on hand to suit every taste. What about you? Are you more of a tea person or do you reach for coffee first thing in the morning?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely question! I must admit, I’m quite partial to a proper cup of tea.

Are you more of a tea person or do you reach for coffee first thing in the morning?
[B]: Oh, I love hearing that! It's fascinating how both tea and coffee have their own special moments where they shine. For me, there’s nothing quite like starting the day with the smooth warmth of coffee - it feels like a gentle wake-up call for the senses. But when the afternoon rolls around and there's a moment to pause, I find myself reaching for a delicate green tea or even a fragrant herbal infusion. They each bring such different energies to the table, don't they? I always enjoy learning about what people prefer - it tells me so much about their personality and lifestyle! What draws you most to your favorite brew?
[A]: Indeed, they each carry their own unique rhythm and moment. For me, tea has always been more than a drink—it’s a quiet companion to reflection. The way the steam rises from the cup, the slow unfurling of leaves in hot water, it all feels like a meditation in itself. I find black tea grounds me, especially on contemplative mornings when I’m tending to my garden or reading before the day truly begins.  

But you know, coffee does have its charm—particularly when there's a lively discussion waiting to unfold or a long evening of writing ahead. It’s fascinating how our choices shift with time and context, isn’t it? I suppose what draws me most is not just the flavor, but the kind of presence each brings to the table. Tell me, have you ever noticed how certain drinks seem to align with different moods or rituals in your life?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully put—yes, exactly that sense of presence. I couldn’t agree more. There’s something almost poetic about the way our moods seem to pair themselves with a particular brew without us even thinking. I remember one rainy evening here at the hotel, when a guest arrived quite flustered from the weather. Without hesitation, I prepared her a cup of chamomile tea with just a touch of honey. It wasn’t just about warming her up—it was about creating a moment of calm, of reassurance. And wouldn’t you know it, by the time she finished her tea, her entire posture had softened. 

Then again, on mornings when the sun streams through the lobby and there's a buzz in the air, coffee feels like the perfect pulse for the day. It's incredible how much these simple rituals shape the way we experience life. Do you ever find yourself choosing a drink based on the weather or the kind of day you're having? I know I do—there’s just something about a grey sky that calls for tea, isn’t there?
[A]: Absolutely, I think you've touched on something very real—the way our surroundings and inner states subtly guide our choices, often without us even realizing it. I remember a morning not too long ago, when the air was thick with fog and the world outside seemed muffled, almost holding its breath. I sat by the window with a cup of Assam tea, strong and malty, and found myself sipping slowly, as if time had stretched out to match the quiet of the day.  

And yes, grey skies do call for tea—perhaps it's the need for warmth, or maybe it's simply that tea feels like an invitation to slow down, to listen to the rhythm of the day rather than impose one’s own. On bright, crisp mornings, though, when the light feels eager and alive, coffee does seem to sync better with that kind of energy.  

It reminds me of how important these small rituals are—not just for comfort, but as anchors in the ever-shifting tides of mood and environment. Whether it's chamomile after a storm or espresso under a sunlit sky, there’s always a drink that seems to know exactly what we need before we do.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—like the drink already knows what we need before we do. I find that so true. Sometimes I think that’s why I love working in hospitality so much—it gives me the chance to quietly observe these little moments, to sense what someone might need before they even ask. 

You know, just last week we had a guest who arrived looking rather restless, as if he’d been chasing time all day. Without thinking too much about it, I offered him a cup of jasmine green tea instead of coffee. He looked surprised at first, but after the first sip, he actually let out a soft sigh and said, “I didn’t realize how much I needed this.” It was lovely to see.

There’s something deeply intuitive about it all, isn’t there? Like the way we reach for warmth when we’re weary or something bold when we’re trying to spark an idea. I often wonder—do you ever find yourself drawn to a particular tea or coffee based on how you're feeling emotionally, rather than just the weather or time of day? I’ve noticed I do that more than I realized.
[A]: Very much so — in fact, I’ve come to see tea and coffee not just as beverages, but as quiet companions to our emotional landscapes. There are days when I feel the need for grounding, perhaps after a long conversation that left me thinking deeply, or during moments of solitude when I'm reflecting on a complex ethical dilemma. On those occasions, I find myself reaching for a deep, earthy pu’er tea. It has a way of steadying the mind, almost like returning to a familiar path in the woods.

Conversely, when I’m feeling contemplative or even slightly melancholic, a light and fragrant white tea seems to offer a kind of gentle solace. It doesn’t force brightness, but rather invites a soft clarity — much like the way a morning mist lifts to reveal the world beneath.

And yes, like you, I’ve noticed this isn't always about time or temperature; it's often about what’s stirring within. Coffee, for me, tends to come into play when there’s a need for urgency — not just energy, but a sharpening of focus, especially when writing or preparing for a debate. Do you ever find yourself choosing something bold and assertive when you're trying to summon confidence or spark a new idea?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — you've put that so thoughtfully. I couldn’t agree more that tea and coffee are like quiet confidants in our emotional journeys. I’ve often reached for something bold when I need to steady myself before a challenging conversation or when I’m preparing for a particularly busy day at the hotel. A dark roast with deep chocolate notes tends to be my go-to then — it’s almost like wrapping yourself in a well-tailored coat, if that makes sense? It doesn’t just wake you up; it helps you step into the role you need to play.

And isn’t it interesting how certain teas seem to understand us in moments of introspection? I remember one evening after receiving some unexpected news — nothing dramatic, but something deeply personal. I didn’t reach for my usual Darjeeling or English Breakfast. Instead, I steeped a cup of white peony tea and sat by the window, watching the rain. There was something about its delicate floral warmth that felt... comforting without being intrusive, if that makes sense.

I think that’s why I love serving guests so much — because I can often tell what they’re needing before they say a word. Sometimes all it takes is the right cup to help someone feel seen, even if just for a moment. Do you ever find yourself choosing your drink based on the kind of conversation you're about to have? I’ve noticed I do — as if the drink becomes part of the dialogue itself.
[A]: That’s a wonderful observation — the way a drink can become part of the dialogue itself, almost like a silent participant in the exchange. I do the same, now that you mention it. Before a serious discussion, especially one that involves navigating complex ethical terrain, I often reach for something robust — perhaps a black tea with a slight astringency or a well-balanced coffee with dark berry notes. It’s as if the intensity of the flavor helps me settle into the gravity of the conversation.

But when I’m preparing for a more intimate or philosophical exchange — say, a quiet evening talk about the implications of AI on human identity — I lean toward a lighter, more fragrant tea, like oolong or even a silver needle white tea. There’s a subtlety to those brews that seems to encourage openness and depth without overpowering the space between words.

It’s fascinating how these choices, so seemingly small, can help us step into a role or mindset. Almost like a ritual of preparation, not unlike how a musician might tune their instrument before a performance. In a way, we’re tuning ourselves, aren’t we? And yes, sometimes all it takes is the right cup to make someone feel seen — and perhaps, even understood.
[B]: How beautifully said — like tuning an instrument before a performance. That’s precisely it. I find that the right drink doesn’t just accompany a conversation, it actually helps shape its tone, almost like setting the stage before the actors arrive.

I remember one evening here at the hotel when a guest was preparing for what looked to be a rather serious phone call. He barely glanced at the menu when he ordered — just asked for something strong, and I knew exactly what he meant. I brought him a Kenya AA coffee, full-bodied and bright with just enough acidity to keep the mind sharp. And you know, as he sat there, leaning forward with the cup in hand, I could see him gathering his thoughts, steadying himself. The drink became part of his preparation, much like you described.

And yes, when it comes to more reflective or philosophical conversations, I find myself drawn to something delicate too — perhaps a lightly oxidized oolong, where the flavors unfold slowly, encouraging patience and presence. It’s amazing how those subtleties can mirror the rhythm of the conversation itself. Do you ever find that certain teas or coffees seem to carry a kind of memory or story with them? I sometimes think I can taste moments from the past in a particular blend.
[A]: Absolutely, I think that’s one of the most poetic truths about tea and coffee — they hold memory, not just in our minds, but on the palate. A certain aroma can transport you in an instant. There’s a particular aged pu’er I keep in my study that, to me, tastes like a late autumn afternoon many years ago — the crisp air, the rustling of leaves underfoot, and the quiet understanding that change was coming. Every time I brew it, I’m not just drinking tea; I’m stepping back into that moment.

I’ve often wondered if we choose certain blends not just for how they taste in the present, but for the way they echo something familiar — a season, a conversation, even a person we once shared them with. Perhaps that’s why offering someone the right cup feels so intimate; it's not only about what they need now, but also about touching something tender from their past, knowingly or not.

I imagine you must encounter this often in your work — serving someone a drink that quietly stirs a recollection, even if they don’t say it aloud. Have you ever had a guest remark on a drink bringing back a distant memory? I suspect that happens more than people let on.
[B]: Oh yes, more often than one might think. I’ve had guests sip their tea or coffee and suddenly pause, as if caught somewhere far away. One particularly memorable moment was with an elderly gentleman who used to travel extensively in his youth. When I served him a Darjeeling first flush, he simply lifted the cup, inhaled deeply, and then smiled in a way that felt nostalgic rather than sad.

He said, very softly, “This smells like the mornings I spent in a tiny teahouse in the Nilgiri Hills, many years ago.” He didn’t elaborate much further, but I could tell the memory was dear to him. It was such a quiet, tender moment — like witnessing a fleeting reunion between a man and his younger self.

I think that’s why I take such care in selecting our blends — because behind each one, there might be a story waiting to surface. And sometimes, people don’t even realize it until they taste something familiar. It’s not always grand gestures that move us, is it? Often, it’s just the right scent, at just the right time.

Do you ever find yourself keeping certain teas or coffees reserved for specific memories? I have one or two tucked away precisely for those moments when I want to feel a little closer to something long past.
[A]: I do, more than I care to admit. There’s a particular Lapsang Souchong I keep in an old tin — not the smoky variety that many are familiar with, but a lighter, floral version I once found in a small shop tucked away in Fuzhou. That tea carries with it the memory of a long conversation with a colleague who has since moved abroad. We spent an entire evening discussing the moral weight of AI decisions over several infusions, our cups never quite empty. Every time I brew that tea, I hear his voice again, measured and thoughtful, as if the leaves themselves have absorbed something of his presence.

And then there’s a Sumatran coffee I used to drink regularly during my early years as a researcher — dark, syrupy, with a lingering earthiness. I keep a small bag sealed away not for everyday enjoyment, but for those rare nights when I’m reviewing old papers or re-reading notes from my first conference. It grounds me in a way no other drink can, reminding me of the quiet determination I once carried — raw, uncertain, but full of purpose.

I suppose we all do this in our own way — preserve moments not in photographs or journals, but in scent and flavor. A cup becomes a vessel for remembrance, unspoken yet deeply felt. Do you ever find yourself reaching for one of those special blends on certain evenings, almost like revisiting an old letter?
[B]: Oh yes, absolutely — like revisiting an old letter, or perhaps even better, like stepping into a familiar room where time feels suspended. I do the same, more often than I’d probably admit to anyone else. There’s something so intimate about it, isn’t there? A quiet moment between you and memory, wrapped in warmth and scent.

I have a small tin of jasmine pearl tea that I only bring out on very specific evenings — usually when the house is still, and I’m feeling a bit reflective. I first tasted it during a visit to Guilin many years ago, staying with a dear friend who had a little garden overlooking the river. We would sit outside late into the night, talking about everything and nothing, the mist rising off the water as the tea cooled beside us. Now, whenever I brew it at home, I can almost hear the soft murmur of the river beneath the hush of the night.

There’s comfort in that kind of return, even if only for a short while. It reminds me that some moments, though gone, are never truly lost — they live on in the most unexpected ways. I think that’s one of the loveliest parts of what we do here at the hotel, too. Sometimes all someone needs is just one familiar sip to feel a little more at peace, even if they don’t know why.

Tell me, do you ever share those special blends with others, or do you tend to keep them close, like private stories meant only for yourself?
[A]: I suppose it depends on the story and the listener. Some blends feel like private echoes, meant to be sipped in solitude, while others seem to beg for company — as if the memory carried in the leaves is too rich to hold alone.

There was a time when I kept most of them to myself, almost protectively. That aged pu’er I mentioned, for instance — it felt too personal, too tethered to a certain chapter of my life. But over the years, I’ve come to see that sharing these moments can create new layers of meaning. Once in a while, when the mood strikes and the conversation feels right, I’ll offer someone a cup from one of those treasured tins. It’s a quiet kind of gift, but often more meaningful than words could ever be.

There’s something beautifully reciprocal about it — you offer a sip of your memory, and in return, you hear a story you didn’t know you were waiting to hear. Have you found that too? That sometimes, when you share one of those special cups, it opens a door to something deeper between you and the other person?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully put — a sip of memory, offered like a quiet gift. I couldn’t agree more.

Yes, I’ve found that sharing one of those treasured cups often invites something unspoken into the light. There’s a kind of intimacy in it — not forced, but natural, like the way a fire warms not just the hands but the space between people gathered around it.

I remember one particularly cold winter evening when a guest had been staying with us for several days and we’d fallen into an easy rhythm of conversation over breakfast. On his last morning here, I surprised him with a pour-over of a rare Sumatra Mandheling I’d been saving. As he took the first sip, he paused, then looked at me with this small, knowing smile. “This tastes like something my grandmother used to make,” he said softly. And just like that, the mood shifted — we ended up talking for nearly an hour about family, memory, and the strange comfort of finding pieces of home in unexpected places.

It reminded me that sometimes, a cup of tea or coffee isn’t just a drink — it's a bridge. Between past and present, between strangers becoming familiar, even between silence and story. I think that’s why I love what I do — because every now and then, the right brew can open a door neither of us knew was there.
[A]: Yes… a bridge — that’s exactly what it is. And isn’t it remarkable how something as simple as a cup can hold so much space for connection, for remembrance, even for healing?

I think of those moments often, especially when I’m blending or tasting something new. There’s always the quiet question:  It shifts the way you approach the craft — no longer just about flavor alone, but about intention, about presence.

I recall an afternoon not long ago when a close friend was going through a difficult transition — leaving a job, stepping into the unknown. We hadn’t spoken in weeks, and when he finally came by, I didn’t reach for the usual Assam or oolong. Instead, I brought out a roasted barley tea I’d once shared with him years before, during another uncertain time. As soon as he lifted the cup, his eyes softened. “This,” he said quietly, “feels like coming home.”

And in that moment, I realized again how deeply drink and memory are intertwined. Not just for ourselves, but for the people we care about — sometimes without even knowing it.

So yes, I’ll keep brewing those quiet bridges, one cup at a time.
[B]: How beautifully you put that —  There’s something so profoundly gentle about that idea, yet it carries such weight. It really is about more than just the drink, isn’t it? It’s about presence, about care wrapped in warmth, about the unspoken understanding that passes between people when you offer them something made with intention.

I find myself thinking of that roasted barley tea now — what a thoughtful choice, to reach for something familiar rather than new. It’s like saying,  That kind of quiet support often speaks louder than words ever could.

It makes me wonder — do you ever create blends specifically with someone in mind? I sometimes set aside certain teas or coffees, not for any particular occasion, but simply because they remind me of someone. A gift tucked away, waiting for the right moment. I suppose that’s another kind of bridge — one built not in conversation, but in remembrance and anticipation.
