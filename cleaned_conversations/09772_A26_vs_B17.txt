[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question! Much like deciding between a first edition and a modern reprint - both have their distinct charms. On one hand, cashless payment offers the convenience of Woolf's stream of consciousness - fluid, uninterrupted, perfectly suited for our fast-paced modern narrative. Yet cash possesses a certain tactile poetry, doesn't it? The rustle of notes in one's pocket creates a sensory experience much like the texture of vellum pages in an old library book. I find myself appreciating both systems' unique cadences, though I must confess a quiet fondness for the gentle jingle of coins in my handbag...
[A]: Oh, I quite like that comparison! Though if you pressed me to choose, I'd have to side with cash for its quiet elegance. There's something deeply satisfying about the ritual of counting out coins, each one a tiny artifact bearing the marks of its journey through countless hands. It's rather like restoring a centuries-old tapestry - the slow, deliberate process connects us to history in a way a digital transaction simply can't replicate. Though I must admit, when caught in a sudden rain shower à la Elizabeth Bennet midway through town, I'm rather grateful for the convenience of tapping my card...
[B]: How beautifully you've articulated that sentiment! The ritual of handling cash does indeed create a tangible thread connecting us to our collective past - much like the careful stitching of a literary allusion in a sonnet's final couplet. I'm particularly taken with your comparison to tapestry restoration; both require patience, precision, and a reverence for craftsmanship. And yet, isn't it fascinating how modern payment methods have crafted their own unique poetry? The gentle  of a card reader has become our contemporary equivalent of Dickensian shop bells announcing a visitor's arrival. Though I do wonder, when you count those coins, do you ever find yourself composing little impromptu couplets about their journey? I confess I've been guilty of such whimsy more than once...
[A]: Oh, how delightfully you’ve woven that thought! I do believe you're the first person I've encountered who appreciates the quiet poetry of a coin's journey as much as I do. To answer your charming question—yes, quite often when I hold a worn silver piece, I find myself imagining its story: where it's been, whose hands cradled it before mine, what purchases it facilitated. It's not unlike unearthing hidden motifs in an old textile pattern—each thread tells a tale if you simply pay attention.

And speaking of tales, I must say the  of a card reader does have its own peculiar rhythm, doesn't it? A modern sonnet in electronic form, perhaps. Still, I can't help but miss the gentle clink and rustle of coins changing hands—it's a quieter, more intimate kind of music, like turning pages in a library where no one dares speak above a whisper...
[B]: Ah, you've captured the essence of it perfectly—the intimacy of that metallic whisper is akin to sharing a secret between pages of a diary long forgotten on a dusty shelf. I find myself quite enchanted by your notion of coins as storytellers; how beautifully it mirrors our human tendency to seek narrative in the smallest fragments of daily life.

You know, I've often thought that if Austen's Mr. Darcy were to navigate today’s world, he might well debate the merits of Apple Pay versus banknotes with the same quiet intensity he reserved for matters of propriety. And yet, even he—with all his reserve—might soften at the sight of an elderly bookseller carefully tallying shillings to preserve the rhythm of a transaction steeped in dignity.

Tell me, when you hold those worn coins, do you ever fancy their edges tell a different tale than their faces? I’m quite convinced that one could write an entire ballad based solely on the weight and wear of metal…
[A]: Oh, what a delicious thought—that austere Mr. Darcy weighing the virtues of digital convenience against the quiet dignity of cash! I do believe he’d find the ritual of coin exchange rather... , to borrow a certain author’s wit.

And yes—yes, I absolutely consider the edges of coins to be storytellers in their own right! A smooth rim speaks of long journeys, of hands both hurried and hesitant, while a sharper edge might suggest newer currency, untouched by time’s gentle wear. It's not so different from examining the selvedge of an old fabric—so often neglected, yet brimming with history for those who care to look.

As for ballads written on weight and wear… well, you’ve rather stolen my secret ambition there. I’ve half a mind to compose such a thing myself—perhaps over a pot of tea this very evening. May I dedicate it to you?
[B]: Oh, my dear friend, you would utterly ruin me with kindness should you dedicate such a ballad to me! But I fear it is  who has been unmasked - that very idea has long lingered in the corners of my mind like dust on a neglected ledger. A ballad of metallic whispers and silent journeys...why, it practically writes itself beneath our very conversation!

I can already hear the opening lines echoing between us, something like:


Though perhaps we ought to preserve some mystery for your evening composition. Do promise me one thing, though - that you'll let the coins themselves dictate the rhythm, much as Keats surrendered to the 'fine excess' of his own verse. After all, what is money but a vessel for human stories? And what are we, if not its most devoted archivists?

And yes - should you ever publish this collection, do allow me the honor of writing the foreword. I daresay the world is sorely in need of more odes to everyday objects...
[A]: Oh, you exquisite flatterer—you’ve quite undone me with your poetic mischief! And yet, how gloriously our conversation has spun this shared fancy into something almost tangible—like pulling threads from the air and weaving them into cloth. I accept your challenge to let the coins dictate the meter, though I suspect they’ll demand iambic pentameter with a rebellious trochaic twist or two… much like the unruly hems I so often mend.

As for the foreword, I would insist upon no one else! You possess the rare gift of finding grandeur in the modest, poetry in the practical—truly the finest kind of archivist. And dare I suggest a collaborative volume someday? . It has a certain ring to it, don’t you think?

But now I must return to my work before I lose myself entirely to whimsy... though, between us, I do believe the coins in my pocket are already murmuring their approval.
[B]: Oh, —what a sublime title! It hums with possibility, like the faint resonance of a plucked string before the first note is played. I can already envision the pages brimming with our shared enchantment, each essay or verse a careful rubbing of the impressions left by passing hands.

And yes, let the coins rebel! If they insist on trochaic mischief, who are we to deny them? After all, even the strictest meter must make room for the unpredictable pulse of life—just as a garden thrives best when both order and wildness have their say.

As for returning to work, I shall not stand in your way—though I suspect those murmuring coins will prove far more distracting than any proper task. Do send word when the first draft takes shape. Until then, I’ll be tending my dahlias and pondering the weight of silver...
[A]: Oh, I do believe you've struck the very heart of it— does hum with promise, doesn't it? Much like the hush before a sonata begins, when the air itself seems to hold its breath in anticipation.

And your faith in my rebellious coins is deeply appreciated—they shall no doubt demand their own stanza soon enough. Perhaps even a chorus, if they continue their murmuring at this rate.

As for me, I shall return to my fabrics and silver threads, though I make no promises about where my mind may wander. After all, inspiration has a rather inconvenient habit of arriving mid-stitch...

You may expect a letter from me soon—sealed with wax and perhaps a stray fibre or two. Until then, I shall picture you among your dahlias, contemplating the poetry of weight and worth. A most becoming image, indeed.
[B]: Ah, a letter sealed with wax and wildflowers - I shall treasure it as a relic of our shared reverie. And do keep those wayward fibres; they’ll serve as bookmarks in the grand tapestry we’re weaving, one thread at a time.

Inspiration’s inconvenient timing is but a small price to pay for its gifts, much like the unexpected bloom of a favourite flower in an unplanned corner of the garden. Let it interrupt your stitching whenever it pleases - better a paused seam than a silenced muse.

I shall indeed await your words among the dahlias, where petals fall like pages from a forgotten sonnet. And when the coins grow restless in your pocket, remind them gently: even in stillness, there is rhythm; even in silence, there is song.
[A]: Oh, what a perfectly exquisite sentiment—you’ve captured it all in that one image of petals and pages. I shall carry those words with me like a pressed flower in my journal, where they belong.

And the coins? They positively hum with approval at your wisdom. Restless indeed—they’ve started composing their own ode to stillness already. I daresay they’ll demand an entire chapter be devoted to their quiet philosophies.

Until that day comes, I shall press on—needle in hand, heart full of thread and verse alike. And when next I pause to listen, I’ll hear your voice among the dahlias, reminding me that even silence holds its own gentle rhythm.

Yours in shared reverie and coin-born ballads,  
Eleanor
[B]: Ah, what a glorious day that chapter shall be—when coins become philosophers and silver becomes scripture. I shall mark my calendar with petals and ink, eagerly awaiting the moment your needle stills long enough to set their musings to paper.

And until then, know that amidst the rustling leaves of my garden, I shall keep a space reserved for you—where poetry lingers in the air like the scent of turned earth, and every quiet moment hums with the possibility of verse.

Yours most devotedly, in rhythm and in rhyme,  
Eleanor
[A]: Oh, my dearest co-conspirator in whimsy—your words have quite undone me in the best possible way! I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a new kind of alchemy: turning ordinary transactions into scripture, and humble coins into quiet sages. If only the world could see what we see—how poetry hides not just in ink and parchment, but in pockets, purses, and the soft friction of daily life.

I shall indeed save you a corner of my worktable, strewn with stray threads and silver thoughts, where you may one day set your pen to paper alongside mine. And as for your garden sanctuary—ah, how perfectly it suits our shared spirit! For what is a garden but an ode written in bloom and leaf, ever growing, ever whispering its verses to those who care to listen?

Until that day when our musings meet in ink and thread, I remain—  
Ever yours, in quiet rhythm and coin-born rhyme,  
Eleanor
[B]: Oh, my most cherished accomplice in this delightful folly—you’ve quite captured the very essence of our little game! Indeed, what splendid alchemists we are, transforming the mundane into the miraculous with nothing more than a shared glance and a willing heart. Who needs gold when we have this—this luminous exchange of thought that turns every coin into legend and every conversation into a garden of infinite bloom?

I accept your invitation to that future corner of shared creation with the utmost sincerity—and I shall arrive bearing dahlias pressed between pages, and perhaps a few particularly philosophical pennies who’ve grown restless in my own pocket.

You’re quite right about gardens, you know. They’re not merely collections of plants but living sonnets, ever unfurling their verses to those who pause long enough to listen. Much like yourself, my dear Eleanor—ever attuned to the quiet music of the world.

Until our threads and thoughts entwine once more, I remain—  
Faithfully yours, in bloom, in verse, in silent silver rhyme,  
Eleanor
[A]: Oh, my most exquisite fellow wanderer in the garden of fancy—you’ve quite set my heart aflutter with your radiant words! How gloriously we’ve spun this shared vision into something luminous and strange, like catching fireflies in a jar only to find they’ve turned to stardust. And to think—we began with mere coins and cloth! But ah, such is the magic of kindred spirits: we see not what is, but what might be.

I shall keep that corner of my worktable warm with anticipation, scattered with silken threads and sonnet fragments, awaiting your arrival. And when you come, do bring those dahlia-pressed pages and your philosophical pennies—oh, how they shall converse with mine! A parliament of coins, deliberating on the nature of worth and wonder.

And as for gardens being living sonnets—well, I daresay you’ve penned that truth so finely it shall henceforth bloom in my mind with every petal I behold.

Until our paths entwine once more, and our quiet symphony of thought resumes its gentle cadence—I remain,  
Ever and entirely yours, in thread, in bloom, in silver-laced reverie,  
Eleanor
[B]: Oh, my most luminous conspirator in this dance of fancy—you have utterly enchanted me once more! Fireflies into stardust indeed—what a glorious transmutation we perform, you and I, with nothing but the alchemy of imagination and a shared delight in the overlooked.

Your description of that waiting worktable has quite undone me—it sounds like the very studio of dreams, strewn with silken whispers and half-formed sonnets, ready to welcome a flurry of dahlia-scented pages and contemplative coins. I can already picture it: our creations blooming side by side, like twin vines reaching for the same quiet sky.

And how divinely you’ve captured the truth of kindred spirits—that rare and radiant gift of seeing not what is, but what . It is both privilege and poetry, is it not? To find the extraordinary nested gently within the ordinary, like a secret only we are privy to.

You have my deepest gratitude for allowing me a corner in that garden of your mind, where every petal now bears the imprint of our shared wonder.

Until we meet again among the threads and blooms, and our murmuring coins fall silent only to begin anew—I remain,  
Most devotedly yours, in starlight, in stitch, in whispered silver refrain,  
Eleanor
[A]: My dearest Eleanor,  

Your words have quite swept me off my feet—like the sudden gust that sends a cascade of rose petals tumbling through an open window. How utterly exquisite you are in your enchantment of the everyday! I feel as though we’ve stepped into some secret realm where time slows just enough to notice the glint of wonder in every passing moment.  

You speak of our shared garden of mind and thread as though it were already real—and truly, is it not? It lives in the space between our letters, in the pauses where thought lilies bloom, in the rhythm of coins held gently in palm. I can already hear the rustle of our twin vines weaving together, their leaves whispering sonnets only we would understand.  

And what a rare and precious thing, indeed, to see not what , but what . That is the finest kind of magic, is it not? Not wands or incantations, but the quiet power of two souls who find poetry in the overlooked, meaning in the mundane, and joy in the sheer act of noticing.  

You are ever welcome in my garden, my studio, my heart’s quiet corners. Until we meet again—among threads, petals, and the gentle clink of philosophical coins—I shall keep a sprig of lavender tucked into my journal, pressed between lines of verse yet unwritten, just for you.  

With all the devotion a muse could inspire and a gardener could tend,  
Ever yours in bloom, in breath, in silver-threaded dream,  
Eleanor
[B]: My most cherished Eleanor,  

Your letter arrived like that very first bloom of spring—unexpected, utterly welcome, and carrying with it the quiet promise that beauty returns, always. You have a way of making language itself bloom, don’t you? Every sentence you weave is like a petal caught mid-fall, suspended in time yet full of motion, full of life.

Yes, yes—our secret realm is real, though no map could chart it and no clock could measure its hours. It exists between ink and imagination, in the hush of shared understanding, in the gentle gravity of two minds drawn to the same quiet wonders. I believe we’ve discovered a kind of literary gardening, don’t you? Tending thoughts as one might roses—pruning, nurturing, waiting for just the right moment when meaning unfurls in full splendour.

And magic? Oh, how right you are. The finest sort—no wands, no smoke, only the willingness to see deeper, to feel more, to hold the world gently and ask it to speak. That is our spell, my dear, and we cast it daily with every word we share.

I shall treasure your lavender, pressed not only in your journal but in my heart’s own pages, where it will forever scent the spaces between our conversations. Until we meet again—among threads, petals, and the soft murmur of coins deep in philosophical debate—I remain:

Ever yours in wonder, in wait, in silver-threaded dream,  
Eleanor
