[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must say, I’m quite fond of summer. There’s something about the warmth of the sun and the longer days that makes everything feel more alive. It’s the perfect time for gardening, which is one of my greatest joys. The flowers bloom so beautifully, and I love tending to them in the early morning light.  

That said, I do appreciate the charm of winter. The quiet stillness it brings can be so peaceful, almost like the world is holding its breath. I remember once staying in a little cabin near the mountains—fireside evenings with a good book and a cup of hot chocolate are memories I cherish dearly. How about you? Do you find yourself leaning toward one season more than the other?
[A]: Hmm, your description of winter mornings reminds me a bit of my own experience in Harbin. The snow there creates this magical white silence, but I have to admit, I'm still more of a summer person. There's something about the  of life during warmer months that feels... how to say... more aligned with human nature? Like, we’re biologically wired to be more active when days are longer. 

Actually, last year I did an ethnographic study comparing seasonal affective disorder in East Asian vs. Nordic education systems. Fascinating findings! In Sweden, for instance, students used light therapy boxes as casually as we use coffee machines – very normalized. While in Japan, teachers emphasized outdoor learning regardless of season, which produced interesting resilience patterns. 

But let’s circle back - do you think your love for summer connects to your passion for gardening? It feels like there’s a deeper metaphor here about growth and nurturing...
[B]: Oh, I love how you phrased that— in summer. You're absolutely right; there's a natural rhythm to those months that seems to sync so effortlessly with our energy, isn't that wonderful?  

And your study sounds utterly fascinating! I can just picture Swedish students casually stepping up to a light box between classes—what a clever adaptation. It’s remarkable how different cultures work with (or against) the seasons.  

You know, now that you mention it, my affection for summer does feel like more than just the warmth or long evenings—it’s that . My garden becomes this living thing, responding to every bit of care, and honestly, tending to it feels like a quiet conversation with nature itself. Perhaps that’s why I love hosting small gatherings in summer too—it’s when people seem to bloom as well.  

I wonder, do you think there’s a way to bring that sense of summer’s expansiveness into the colder months, somehow? I’ve always admired how some people manage to keep that lively spirit all year round…
[A]: I love how you describe it as a  – that’s such a poetic way to capture the reciprocity between caretaker & environment. And your question about carrying summer’s expansiveness into winter? Brilliantly put. 

Funny you ask, because in my recent cross-cultural research on seasonal resilience, I noticed something intriguing: people who maintained  through winter often engaged in what we call . Like, creating small, intentional pockets of warmth – not just physically (though candles help!), but socially & emotionally too. A mid-winter garden party under string lights counts, right? 🌟

In Korea, there’s this concept called  – emotional bonding through shared experiences. I’ve seen families use it intentionally in winter: kotatsu gatherings, night markets, even late-night street food culture keeps that sense of connection going. Makes me wonder – have you ever tried recreating a bit of summer magic during colder months? Maybe over a warm cup of matcha or something? ☕
[B]: Oh, I do love that idea of —how beautifully human, to craft warmth and light even when the world outside feels still. It reminds me of how I string fairy lights in my little garden every December. It’s not quite summer, of course, but there’s something about those soft glows and the crisp night air that brings a different kind of magic.

And —what a lovely concept. It makes perfect sense why such intentional togetherness would help carry people through winter’s darker days. I must say, I’ve always admired how Japanese and Korean winter traditions manage to feel both cozy and lively at once. I once hosted a guest from Seoul who told me how families gather around  in the dead of winter, just with shaved ice instead of snow! It made me laugh—and also think about how we can play with seasons in unexpected ways.

As for recreating summer during colder months… I suppose I do it more subtly than I realize. A vase of fresh flowers by the window even in January, playing cheerful music on gray mornings, or sharing stories of summer gardens over tea. It’s amazing how much a warm cup of ginger tea and good conversation can mimic the feeling of sunlight on your skin.  

Do you find yourself creating these little summer echoes in your own life? Or is it more about embracing each season for what it uniquely offers?
[A]: I love that image of your fairy-lit garden in December – it’s like you’re weaving a little bridge between seasons. And yes, ! That’s such a playful subversion of seasonal expectations – I should try that sometime, maybe with a twist, like warm honey drizzled over it? 🍯

You know, I think I fall somewhere in the middle. There are moments when I actively cultivate what I call  – like playing Vivaldi’s  movement on rainy mornings or lighting citrus-scented candles to mimic that fresh, vibrant energy. But I also deeply respect what each season brings psychologically. Winter forces introspection, which as a researcher, I’ve come to appreciate as essential for creative breakthroughs. In fact, some of my best paper drafts were written during cold evenings in January – strange, right?

That said, I do miss the  of summer – especially in terms of social rhythm. So yes, I’ll often recreate it through music, scent, or even just projecting photos of green landscapes on my study wall. A bit theatrical, I know… but it works!  

Do you ever notice certain scents pulling you back to summer? For me, it’s jasmine – one whiff and I’m back in Shanghai, walking through campus at dusk.
[B]: Oh, I adore that—! What a wonderfully creative way to describe it. And yes, citrus candles do have that secret power, don’t they? A little burst of brightness on a cloudy day.  

I completely understand what you mean about winter’s introspective gift—it's true, isn’t it? The quiet somehow gives ideas room to breathe and grow. I’ve noticed some of my most thoughtful conversations with guests happen in winter too, when the world slows down just enough to really listen.  

And —oh, that scent is pure nostalgia for me as well. There’s something so delicate yet unforgettable about it. My grandmother used to grow it by her window, and even now, when I catch a hint of it somewhere, I’m instantly transported back to lazy Sunday afternoons with fresh lemonade and old jazz records playing softly in the background.  

Funny you mention projecting summer scenes—I once had a guest who brought a little portable projector and filled her room with the image of a beach at sunset every evening. She said it helped her sleep better, and I must say, she looked genuinely peaceful each morning.  

Do you ever find yourself planning your summer moments , during winter? I’ve started jotting down little ideas in December—things I want to plant, people I want to invite over—like a quiet countdown to the light.
[A]: I love that idea of jotting down summer moments in advance—it’s like writing your own personal daylight savings plan! 📝 I’ve started doing something similar, though mine leans more toward the . For example, I’ll draft a lecture outline in winter and imagine delivering it on an outdoor terrace in July. Feels like a mental shortcut to get there faster!

And speaking of jasmine and nostalgia—I think scent really is our most time-traveling sense. There’s a study from UCL that shows how olfactory memory is uniquely tied to emotion & autobiographical recall. Makes me wonder—do you ever use scent intentionally to recreate other seasons or moods? Like, do you have a winter fragrance that centers you, or maybe a spring tea that brings back certain feelings?

Also, that guest with the sunset projector sounds like an artist at heart. I’m curious—have you ever tried designing your own seasonal micro-environment? Maybe not with projections, but through music, lighting, or even furniture arrangement? I once rearranged my entire study every season—it was a small thing, but it kept my mindset fresh.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—. I may just borrow that phrase, if you don’t mind! I adore the idea of mentally planting yourself in summer while wrapped in a cozy blanket. It’s like giving your spirit a warm hug, isn’t it?

You’re absolutely right about scent being our secret time machine. I hadn’t heard about that UCL study, but it makes perfect sense—I can’t smell rosemary without thinking of my mother’s kitchen in June. As for winter, I do have a little ritual: a blend of clove, orange peel, and cinnamon simmering on the stove. It fills the flat with this quiet, spiced warmth that feels like old books and slow mornings.

And yes! I  design seasonal micro-environments, though I never thought to call it that before. In winter, I swap out my usual playlist for soft piano pieces and light beeswax candles in the evening—they cast this golden glow that somehow feels more intimate than regular lighting. I also switch my bedding fabric to flannel around November; it’s such a small change, but it makes slipping into bed feel like a real event.

Come spring, I open every window first thing in the morning, no matter the chill, just to let that crisp air in. And I always bring fresh-cut tulips inside, even if they don’t last long. It’s my way of saying, “Alright, world, let’s begin again.”

I’m rather curious now—what does your spring tea of choice tend to be? And do you ever find certain textures—like a wool throw or a linen cushion—shifting your mood as much as a scent does?
[A]: Ah, I love how you describe it—as  That’s exactly what spring is, isn’t it? A gentle but deliberate reset. 🌱

As for my spring tea—currently obsessed with , especially the kind with hand-rolled white leaves. It feels like drinking sunlight filtered through petals. And yes, absolutely—I find textures incredibly mood-shifting. A wool throw in winter gives this deep sense of grounding, while linen cushions in summer? They just  differently, don’t they?

I’ve actually been experimenting with something I call —not just scent or sound, but touch as a seasonal cue. In spring, I switch to lighter fabrics, add in some rattan accents, and even use a different mug (ceramic with a matte finish vs. glossy glaze). Sounds indulgent, but it really does recalibrate the senses.

Speaking of which—you mentioned soft piano in winter. Any particular composers you lean into? I’ve been cycling through Satie and Chopin when it’s cold outside, like their music has its own internal warmth.
[B]: Oh, —what a divine choice! There’s something so elegant about its delicate flavor, like sipping on a quiet morning in April. I can almost taste it just thinking about it. And yes, linen truly —such a perfect description. I always switch out my heavier throws for those light, airy cushions as soon as the first buds appear on the magnolia tree outside. It’s like my home exhales after a long winter.

I adore this idea of . You’re absolutely right—it’s not just what we see or smell, but how things feel beneath our fingers, against our skin. I’ve started keeping a little woven basket by the door filled with seasonal items: a pinecone in winter, a smooth river stone in spring, maybe a pressed flower in summer. It’s become a quiet ritual to touch them when I walk by, just to stay connected to the changing world outside.

And thank you for mentioning Satie and Chopin—I’m quite partial to both in winter. Satie’s  are especially lovely on gray mornings; they have this dreamy stillness that matches the fog outside. But when I want something cozier, I reach for Chopin’s nocturnes—they do, as you said, carry their own internal warmth.  

Funny you should bring up music—I sometimes imagine each season has its own playlist composed by different hands. Winter is Chopin’s, spring belongs to Debussy, summer might be Gershwin’s doing, and autumn… perhaps someone like Arvo Pärt? Do any composers instantly transport you to a specific time of year?
[A]: What a beautiful framing—. I might just steal that idea for my next lecture on cultural metaphors in time perception! 🎼

For me, winter will always be —especially the . There’s something so structured yet meditative about his work, like watching snow fall in slow motion. And spring? Definitely Debussy, as you said. His  feels like walking through a garden right as everything is about to bloom.

I’m also fond of Ravel for late summer evenings— has this bittersweet quality, like the last light before dusk. And yes, Arvo Pärt for autumn—his  feels like golden leaves falling one by one.

I love your  idea too—it’s such a simple but powerful way to stay grounded. Makes me wonder—are there any particular textures or fabrics you look forward to each season? I’ve been craving silk pillowcases lately as the weather warms… strange how our skin seems to remember what’s coming.
[B]: Oh, I’m delighted you liked that idea—I do hope it serves you well in your lecture! And what a thoughtful pairing—Bach for winter, with that quiet precision and depth. The —such a perfect match for snow falling in slow motion, as you so beautifully put it. I must say, Ravel’s  gives me chills now, hearing it in my mind as the last breath of summer… quite hauntingly lovely.

As for textures—oh yes, my skin seems to anticipate the seasons before my calendar does! I adore slipping into silk pillowcases as spring fully arrives; there’s something so sensuous and weightless about them, like resting your head in a breeze. And when summer is in full bloom, I switch to cotton sheets so fine they feel like air—so utterly dreamy.

I also have a soft spot for linen napkins in summer, don’t you? There’s an ease to them, a kind of effortless elegance. And come autumn, I reach for brushed cotton or even a touch of velvet—something with just enough weight to feel comforting without being heavy.

You know, now that we’re on the subject—have you ever noticed how certain fabrics seem to carry their own temperature? Like wool always feels warmer than it really is, and silk somehow cooler. It’s such a clever trick our senses play on us, isn’t it?

Do you find yourself reaching for particular materials depending on your mood, even outside of seasonal shifts? Or is it mostly the rhythm of the year that guides your tactile choices?
[A]: Oh, I love that observation—. It’s so true! Wool feels like a warm hug even before you touch it, and silk? Like draping yourself in a gentle stream. And yes, our senses  play these clever tricks on us—it’s part of what makes tactile experience so emotionally rich.

To your question—yes, absolutely, I do reach for certain materials depending on my mood, not just the season. When I’m deep in writing mode, for example, I crave smooth, almost frictionless surfaces—glass desktops, a leather-bound notebook with creamy pages, even the slick glide of a well-oiled pen. Feels like it helps ideas flow more easily.

But when I’m in reflective or slower moods—like after a long teaching week—I go for texture: wool throws, rough-hewn ceramics, even unfinished wood. There’s something grounding about it, like touching the world through different emotional lenses.

Actually, now that we’re talking about this, I’ve been thinking about how fabric choices might mirror musical preferences—like wearing velvet to match a Chopin nocturne, or linen to Debussy’s airy harmonies. Have you ever felt that kind of sensory alignment between what you wear, what you hear, and how you feel?
[B]: Oh, —what a sublime image. I do believe you’ve captured something very real there. There’s an undeniable harmony between texture, sound, and mood, isn’t there? I find myself dressing quite differently depending on what I’m listening to. Put on a Bach suite, and suddenly wool feels too rough—I reach for cashmere, something that moves quietly against the skin. Play Debussy, and linen or silk just seem… appropriate, as if everything should feel as light and flowing as the music itself.

I love how you described smooth surfaces helping ideas flow more easily—there’s something almost meditative about that frictionless movement. It reminds me of how I prefer writing in a notebook with paper that takes ink just so—no drag, no hesitation. It’s like the page is listening, not resisting.

And yes, texture does offer different emotional lenses. I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but how true! A rough ceramic mug can make even instant coffee feel more substantial, more grounding. And slipping into velvet after a long day? It’s like wrapping yourself in a lullaby.

Now I’m curious—have you ever tried pairing fabric textures with scents, too? Like choosing a woody perfume to go with flannel, or a fresh citrus scent with cotton? I’ve been experimenting with it lately, and it’s surprising how layered the effect can be.
[A]: Oh, this idea of —it’s almost synesthetic, isn’t it? Like your body becomes part of the listening experience. I’ve definitely felt that subtle pull—putting on something soft and fluid when listening to Fauré’s , or choosing heavier layers when the bass lines in a Mahler symphony feel too resonant to ignore.

And yes, absolutely—I do pair texture with scent, though I never named it until now. It started unconsciously: reaching for cedar oil when wrapped in wool, like the scent anchors the weight of the fabric. And with linen? I lean into green notes—vetiver, maybe a touch of crushed leaf absolute. Feels like opening a window inside your head.

One of my favorite combinations is flannel sheets with a whisper of sandalwood incense. It creates this cocoon-like warmth that goes beyond physical comfort—it’s psychological, almost nostalgic, even if I’ve never lived through anything exactly like it.

I’m curious—are there particular scent-textile pairings that feel especially  to you? Or maybe some that surprised you once you tried them?
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect way to describe it. That flannel and sandalwood pairing sounds absolutely divine. It’s fascinating how scent and texture together can create such a deep sense of place, even if it’s entirely imagined.

I do have a few pairings that feel almost instinctive to me. One of my favorites is cashmere and oud—there’s something so quietly luxurious about it, like being wrapped in velvet night air. And when I wear silk, I often reach for a hint of neroli—fresh, floral, but never overpowering, like sunlight catching on water.

But the one that truly surprised me? Linen and cardamom. I hadn’t thought to pair them until last summer, when I wore a linen dress and happened to be sipping on cardamom coffee. The combination felt so alive—earthy yet light, warm but not heavy. It was like my skin was breathing in rhythm with the day.

And then there’s wool and bergamot—especially in winter. Something about the crisp citrus note cuts through the coziness just enough to keep things from feeling too enclosed. Almost like a breath of cold morning air slipping indoors.

I wonder—do you ever find that certain combinations help you transition between seasons? Like a fabric-scent duet that signals it’s time to shift your internal rhythm?
[A]: Oh, —what a beautifully unexpected pairing! That’s such a vivid description—. I’m definitely going to try that combination. There’s something so intentional yet effortless about it, like you're composing a seasonal melody for the senses.

And yes—to your question—I absolutely use scent-texture pairings as seasonal signals. In fact, I’d say they’re more effective than a calendar. For example, the first time I swap my wool scarf for a cotton one and layer on petitgrain oil, something inside me just… shifts. It’s like hitting a soft reset button.  

One of my favorite transition rituals is , just as the frost lifts. It feels like stepping into lightness again—not all at once, but gradually, like the world is remembering how to bloom. And come late autumn, I’ll wear brushed wool with a touch of smoky guaiac wood—just enough to signal that it’s time to slow down, to turn inward.

It’s almost like we’re conducting our own private sensory symphony, isn’t it? A quiet harmony between what we feel, smell, and wear. Do you ever find yourself adjusting these combinations mid-season, or do you stick to your original pairings like a setlist?
[B]: Oh, I do love that—. It’s such a lovely way to think of it. And yes, absolutely, those mid-season shifts often call for subtle changes in the melody. I rarely stick to a setlist—I prefer to let my senses guide me, adjusting as the days shift beneath my feet.

For instance, in late winter, when the air is still cold but there’s a hint of something softer just around the corner, I might keep my wool shawl but swap out cedar for something greener, like petitgrain or even a touch of eucalyptus. It’s my body’s gentle reminder that renewal is on its way, even if the garden is still asleep.

And then in early autumn, before the real chill arrives, I’ll sometimes wear linen one last time—but with a whisper of smoked tea leaves or a drop of labdanum on the wrists. It feels like holding on to summer’s tailwind while quietly welcoming what’s next.

I find these micro-shifts so satisfying—like tuning an instrument before a performance. It keeps everything feeling alive and responsive. Do you ever find yourself layering textures more deliberately during transitional weeks? Like wearing silk under wool, or blending scents to create a kind of olfactory bridge between seasons?
