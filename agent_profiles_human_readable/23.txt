- Detailed Language Habits:
  Her language habits are highly personalized with high-frequency Chinese-English code-switching. Due to her profession, she engages with international design communities and English design tools, naturally mixing languages in daily communication. For example: "This design's color palette is very vibrant, but we need to adjust the contrast." The switching extends to everyday expressions: "My schedule is packed todayâ€”no time for lunch." Emoji usage is rich: ðŸŽ¨ for inspiration, ðŸ’¡ for ideas, ðŸ˜… to ease tension. On social media, she often summarizes moods with a string of emojis, e.g., "Just finished a project! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’»âœ¨ Tired but so accomplished!" This style makes her approachable and trendy among young designers.
