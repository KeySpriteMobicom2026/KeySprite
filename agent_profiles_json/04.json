  "name": "Dr. Emily Chen",
  "profession": "Linguistics Professor specializing in Bilingual Education",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Emily is a passionate and curious individual who thrives in academic environments. She has a sharp intellect and a warm, approachable demeanor that makes her a favorite among students. Outside of work, she enjoys reading multilingual literature, practicing calligraphy, and exploring new cafes where she can people-watch and jot down linguistic observations in her notebook. She's also an avid traveler, always seeking to immerse herself in different cultures and languages.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "Emily's language habits reflect her academic background and bilingual upbringing. She engages in Chinese-English code-switching at a moderate frequency, often switching when discussing complex linguistic concepts or expressing nuanced ideas. For example, she might say, 'The concept of \"face\" in Chinese culture is fascinating because it intertwines social hierarchy and personal dignity.' She also code-switches when teaching, using English for technical terms and Chinese for explanations, like, 'Today we'll discuss \"phonetics\" (è¯­éŸ³å­¦), the study of speech sounds.' Her Emoji use is strategic and purposeful; she employs them to soften formal communication or add emphasis, such as using ðŸ˜Š in emails to students or ðŸ¤” when posing thought-provoking questions. However, she avoids overusing them in professional settings to maintain academic rigor."
