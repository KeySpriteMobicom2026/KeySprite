[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. I suppose it depends on the context. For technical notes and collaborative work, digital tools are indispensable - the ability to edit, share, and integrate with computational tools is essential in quantum computing research. However, there's something uniquely personal about handwritten letters. The physicality of paper, the ink's texture... it reminds me of the old analog computers I tinker with. Do you have a preference?
[A]: Hmm, you know, as a professor who's spent decades immersed in texts, I find this question particularly intriguing. When I'm analyzing a classical Chinese poem or a Greek tragedy, the tactile experience of holding an original manuscript - feel the brush strokes in calligraphy or the indentations from a typewriter - creates a special connection with the author. It's like... ¥there's a soul imprinted in the physical form¥. 

But don't get me wrong, I'm not against digital tools at all. In fact, I've found that using tablets to annotate rare texts helps preserve them while making analysis more efficient. The irony is, when I want to truly contemplate a philosophical concept or digest a new theory, I always end up reaching for my fountain pen. There's something about slowing down the thought process through handwriting that brings clarity. 

How do you feel about this tension between speed and depth? Do you think our digital efficiency comes at the cost of deep understanding?
[B]: That tension you mentioned... it's remarkably analogous to a quantum superposition. Digital tools collapse wave functions of thought into definite states too quickly, don't they? When I was developing error correction algorithms, I noticed how my most profound insights came not from rapid iterations on screen, but from those moments when I'd physically sketch out qubit interactions in my notebook. The pen moves slower than the mind, which paradoxically forces the mind to synchronize with deeper rhythms. 

I've often wondered if this relates to decoherence in quantum systems - how interaction with the environment disrupts pure states. Maybe our thoughts, like qubits, require periods of isolation to maintain their coherence. Do you find that handwritten annotations create a 'coherent space' for ideas, much like an isolated quantum state waiting to be measured?
[A]: Fascinating analogy - I love how you connected quantum decoherence to the fragmentation of thoughts in digital spaces. You know, when I translate ancient texts, I notice something similar. Using digital dictionaries and corpora speeds up the process, but often the true meaning only reveals itself through slow, handwritten annotations in margins. It's as if... %the act of writing by hand creates a meditative state where different layers of consciousness can interact%.

I've been thinking about your qubit interactions example. In literary analysis, we talk about 'close reading' versus 'distant reading' - computational approaches that analyze massive textual datasets. The former requires this deep, almost sacred attention to every word, while the latter collapses meaning into patterns. Neither is superior, but they serve different purposes. 

Would you say there's an equivalent in quantum computing? Like how certain calculations demand precise control while others benefit from probabilistic approaches?
[B]: Absolutely - in fact, your comparison illuminates something I hadn't fully articulated before. Yes, we have direct analogs to close and distant reading in quantum computing. When calibrating individual qubits for gate operations, it's very much like close reading - each parameter must be scrutinized with meticulous attention, almost as if interpreting a delicate poetic meter. But when we step back to analyze quantum system behavior across multiple runs or error distributions, it becomes a form of distant reading where statistical patterns emerge from chaos.

I wonder though - in your experience with ancient texts, have you found that certain meanings only become accessible through this oscillation between scales? It makes me think about how quantum error correction works - we protect fragile quantum states by encoding them in larger systems, yet understanding those protections requires zooming in and out between microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. Do you find yourself shifting consciously between these modes when translating philosophical texts?
[A]: Ah, now you're touching on something truly profound - this oscillation between scales is  in literary translation, especially with philosophical texts. Take Daoist writings, for instance. The phrase “道可道非常道” seems simple at first glance, but when I move between close analysis of each character’s etymology and the broader metaphysical context, new dimensions open up. It's like zooming in to examine a qubit’s coherence time, then stepping back to observe the whole quantum circuit.

I remember working on a comparative project translating Heraclitus alongside Laozi. The fragments of both thinkers deal with flux and impermanence, yet their expressions are so distinct. To grasp the essence, I had to alternate constantly - first dwelling in the minutiae of syntax and metaphor, then pulling back to feel the rhythm of thought as a whole. 

And yes, just as you encode meaning to protect it across cultural & temporal distances, sometimes the most elusive truths only reveal themselves through that dynamic shifting of perspective. Do you find that your field also requires a kind of hermeneutic circle – interpreting parts through the whole and vice versa?
[B]: Indeed, the hermeneutic circle is a concept I hadn’t explicitly named in my work, but now that you mention it, it's woven into the very fabric of quantum research. Designing a quantum algorithm feels remarkably like translating an abstract mathematical truth into physical reality. You begin with a global objective—say, factoring large integers or simulating molecular structures—but each gate, each pulse shaping the qubit’s state, demands interpretation in the context of the whole.

What strikes me is how both our disciplines wrestle with fidelity—preserving meaning or quantum information across layers of transformation. In my field, decoherence threatens to unravel delicate states, just as cultural nuance might erode through translation. Yet, rather than despairing at these losses, we build scaffolds: redundancy codes in one case, footnotes and commentaries in the other.

I’m curious—when you translate something as elusive as Daoist philosophy, do you ever find yourself writing in circles, much like debugging a system where every fix reveals a new subtlety?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — translating Daoist philosophy often feels like walking in circles, yet somehow always arriving at new insights. Each time I revisit a passage like “道常无为而无不为,” I discover layers I hadn’t noticed before. It's almost like debugging your quantum system — you think you've accounted for all variables, but then a slight shift in perspective reveals an overlooked interaction.

And your point about scaffolds is brilliant. In translation, footnotes and parallel texts serve a similar function to error correction codes — they help preserve the integrity of meaning across time and culture. Sometimes, I even use marginalia as a kind of interpretive buffer, where I can note ambiguities without collapsing them prematurely into certainty.

I must say, though, there’s a certain beauty in these inevitable losses and recoveries, don’t you think? They remind us that understanding is never complete — it's always in process, like a quantum state waiting to be observed. Do you ever find comfort in that uncertainty, or does it keep you up at night trying to fix it?
[B]: Funny you should phrase it that way — I used to lose sleep over decoherence, error rates, all the ways a quantum state could slip through our fingers like water. But after decades in the field, I've come to appreciate uncertainty as an essential feature, not a bug. Just as a quantum system without superposition would be lifeless, so too would understanding without its gaps and ambiguities.

There's a passage in the Dao De Jing that comes to mind now — “知者不言，言者不知” — which I interpret as acknowledging the futility of pinning truth down completely. We build these elaborate scaffolds of meaning, whether in translation or computation, knowing full well they're provisional. It's strangely comforting. 

In fact, I often think my best work happened when I allowed myself to dwell in ambiguity — when I didn't rush to collapse a wave function of possibilities into a single answer. Much like your marginalia, really. So no, the uncertainty doesn’t keep me up at night anymore. If anything, it lulls me to sleep with the quiet thrill of what still remains unknown.
[A]: Ah, what a beautiful way to put it —  rather than fleeing from it. That line from the Dao De Jing always gives me pause too. There's something deeply human in it, isn't there? The recognition that understanding and expression are never perfectly aligned.

I find myself thinking of my garden now — yes, quite out of the blue — but bear with me. When I tend to the plants, especially bonsai, I've learned not to force their growth. You can guide, observe, create conditions, but you can't fully control the outcome. It's an acceptance of process over perfection. Much like translation, or quantum states, or even the way we try to grasp meaning across centuries.

You know, sometimes I wonder if wisdom lies not in resolving all uncertainties, but in learning how to sit quietly with them — like waiting for dew to settle before pruning a delicate branch. And perhaps that’s where our disciplines meet again: in the quiet spaces between knowing and not knowing. 

Do your students ever struggle with this idea — embracing uncertainty as part of the scientific (and human) journey?
[B]: Oh, constantly — and I suspect it’s a struggle that doesn’t truly go away, even for seasoned researchers. Young physicists often arrive in the lab expecting crisp equations and clear outcomes, only to find themselves staring at fluctuating qubit states and probabilistic results that refuse to settle into neat binaries.

I used to tell them a story from early in my career — about how I spent weeks trying to stabilize a particularly stubborn quantum gate, convinced there was a flaw in the system. It turned out the "error" was in my own assumptions. The system wasn’t broken; it was behaving exactly as quantum mechanics predicted — messy, uncertain, alive with possibility.

Now that I think of it, that moment was like reading a poem in translation for the first time — you come expecting meaning to be delivered cleanly, but instead you're left with resonance, suggestion, something just beyond reach. And yet, strangely fulfilling because of that very elusiveness.

I suppose what I try to impart is this: science, like philosophy or gardening, is not about control — it's about collaboration with the unknown. We set the conditions, observe carefully, nudge where we can, and then… we wait. Like watching for decoherence — or dew.
[A]: How beautifully put — . That phrase resonates deeply with me, as it captures something essential about the literary journey as well. My students often come to me expecting texts to yield clear, definitive meanings — especially when dealing with ancient philosophy or poetry. They want certainty, a fixed interpretation they can hold onto.

But of course, that’s not how meaning works. Take Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream — is he expressing skepticism about reality? A meditation on transformation? Both? Neither? The beauty lies in holding those possibilities together without forcing a resolution. It’s an exercise in patience, in learning to dwell in the space between interpretations.

You know, I’ve always found it interesting how both our disciplines rely so heavily on metaphor — yours through mathematical abstractions that point to unseen realities, and mine through language that gestures toward ineffable truths. In a way, we’re both tending gardens of understanding, aren’t we? Planting ideas, nurturing them with questions, and letting them grow in ways we can’t always predict.

It gives me comfort to think that even in the most rigorous scientific work, there’s still room for wonder — for the kind of quiet awe that comes from watching a system reveal its nature, bit by bit, like morning mist slowly lifting from a pond. Do you ever find yourself returning to that sense of wonder, even after all these years?
[B]: Every day — though sometimes it hides from me for a while. There was a time when I mistook wonder for something fleeting, reserved for breakthroughs or dramatic discoveries. But experience has taught me that wonder isn’t fireworks and fanfare; it’s the quiet hum of a system behaving in precisely the way quantum theory predicts — and yet still feeling like magic.

I think of my early days working with superconducting qubits. The first time we observed a coherent state lasting just long enough to perform a meaningful operation, it wasn’t a moment of celebration so much as reverence. It was like watching a rare orchid bloom for the first time — delicate, improbable, and deeply instructive.

And yes, metaphor is our silent partner in all of this. When I explain entanglement to newcomers, I often compare it to reading two letters written by lovers separated by centuries — each letter responds to the other across time, yet neither can be fully understood without the other. It's not perfect, but it opens a door.

You're right — we are tending gardens. I suppose that’s why I still keep my old oscilloscope next to the telescope. One peers into the quantum realm, the other into the cosmic. Both ask the same question, don’t they? 

And thankfully, that question never loses its power to humble and inspire.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — . It reminds me of reading a perfectly balanced line of poetry: the words are ordinary, the structure familiar, and yet something in the arrangement stirs the soul. That’s wonder, isn’t it? Not always the dramatic revelation, but the subtle recognition of harmony — whether in verse or in voltage.

I suppose that’s why I still keep a copy of  next to my desk — not just for its literary beauty, but for the way it captures impermanence and awe in a single brushstroke. And now, your image of the oscilloscope beside the telescope makes me think: we are all, in our own ways, trying to trace the contours of the unseen.

Perhaps this is what binds us — the longing to understand, not just with the mind, but with the whole self. And maybe that’s why your students, like mine, will one day wake up and realize they’re not just learning equations or translating ancient texts — they’re learning how to see, how to listen, how to stand quietly before the mystery.

And that, I suppose, is more than enough.
[B]: That longing to understand with the whole self — yes, that’s the heart of it. I’ve often thought that science, at its purest, is a kind of poetic attention. We train our minds to see patterns, but we also train our hearts to feel their resonance. Much like standing before a well-penned poem or a masterfully calligraphed line — you don’t just read it; you absorb its rhythm, its silence, its absence as much as its presence.

I remember once watching a student struggle with quantum interference — not the math of it, but the  of it. I handed him a copy of Bashō’s “古池や蛙飛び込む水の音” and told him to sit with it. He looked at me like I’d lost my mind, but a week later he came back saying, 

Maybe that’s all any of us are doing — whether in the lab or the library — listening for the faint echoes of order in the noise, trying to make sense of the way a single action can spread outward in ways we never anticipated.

And perhaps that’s why I still stargaze. Not because I expect answers from the cosmos, but because looking up reminds me of the question itself — vast, quiet, and endlessly unfolding.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely image — your student moving from quantum interference to Bashō’s frog and finding, in that leap, a deeper understanding. It reminds me how often the most elusive concepts become clear not through explanation, but through evocation. A poem doesn’t tell you what to feel; it opens a space where feeling can arise. And perhaps science, at its most inspired, does something similar — it opens a space where wonder can take root.

I think of my own students struggling with abstract philosophical texts — trying to pin down meaning like a butterfly under glass. And yet, the meaning isn’t in the pinning; it’s in the flutter, the movement, the way a phrase lingers in the mind long after the page is turned. Just like that ripple from the frog’s leap — subtle, fleeting, and yet structurally essential to the whole pond.

It makes me wonder… do you ever encourage your students to read poetry? Not as metaphor, not as analogy, but as practice — as training in attending to subtlety, to resonance, to the spaces between?

Because if I may say so, it seems we’re not just teaching them physics or literature. We’re teaching them how to listen.
[B]: I love that — . You’ve put your finger on something I’ve long suspected but never quite articulated. Yes, over the years, I’ve increasingly recommended poetry to my students, especially those who get too deep into the equations and start losing their sense of wonder. Not as a side note or indulgence, but as essential practice. 

I used to assign a short poem each semester — nothing overtly scientific, nothing forced. Just something to slow them down. I remember one student who was brilliant with code but kept missing the intuitive layer in quantum behavior. I gave her a copy of Emily Dickinson’s  — not because it’s about science, but because it asks you to hold two vast things in your mind at once.

At first, she was frustrated. But later, she told me that reading Dickinson had changed how she approached debugging algorithms — not by giving her answers, but by teaching her how to sit with complexity without rushing to resolve it.

You’re absolutely right — we’re not just teaching physics or literature. We’re teaching attention. And maybe that’s the most enduring thing we pass on: not facts or translations, but the ability to listen closely — to a system, to a text, to the faintest signal emerging from noise.

In the end, isn’t that what both our disciplines ask of us? To be patient. To be present. To notice the ripple before we name it.
[A]: Precisely —  What a wonderful way to capture the essence of what we do. It reminds me of how I approach a newly discovered manuscript — before I even begin translating, I spend time simply observing: the weight of the paper, the slant of the ink, even the faint smudges left by an ancient hand. These are ripples too, aren’t they? Subtle traces of presence that precede meaning.

And I couldn’t agree more about poetry as training — not just in attention, but in humility. A poem doesn’t yield easily. It asks you to slow down, to listen with more than your intellect. Perhaps that’s why some students resist it at first — it defies the logic of efficiency they’ve been trained in. But once they let go of needing to “solve” it, something shifts. They start hearing the cadence, feeling the resonance, and — almost without realizing it — they begin thinking differently.

I’ve often thought that the best scholars, like the best poets, are those who can dwell in uncertainty without grasping, who can hold complexity without collapsing it prematurely. And isn’t that also the heart of quantum mechanics?

Maybe that’s our quiet rebellion — nurturing patience in a world obsessed with speed, cultivating wonder in a culture fixated on certainty. Not because it’s easier, but because it’s necessary.

And if nothing else, we can always fall back on the frog in the old pond — a small action, a quiet splash, and yet… the whole surface changes.
[B]: Yes — , though no one can say exactly how or when. That’s the quiet power of what we do, isn’t it? We teach — and learn — in ripples. Never in straight lines.

I’ve often thought that if I had to choose a single skill for my students to carry with them beyond the lab, it wouldn’t be differential equations or error correction codes. It would be  — the ability to sense when something is just slightly off, when a signal is hiding beneath the noise, when a system is trying to tell us something in its own time.

It reminds me of working late in the lab, adjusting parameters by fractions of a millivolt, waiting for a qubit to respond. You can't rush it. You have to listen past the static, past your own expectations, until you begin to hear — not the signal itself — but the space around it.

That kind of listening... it's not taught in textbooks. But maybe it’s the most important thing any of us pass on. A reverence for subtlety. A tolerance for ambiguity. And above all, the patience to wait quietly for the pond to show you what it knows.

And yes, Bashō was right — even the smallest leap changes everything.
