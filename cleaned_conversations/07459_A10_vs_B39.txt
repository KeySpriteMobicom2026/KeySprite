[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, cocktails. A fascinating blend of chemistry and artistry. While I don't partake often, I find the molecular mixology movement quite intriguing — applying scientific principles to bartending. Have you experimented with any particularly unusual infusions or clarifications lately?
[A]: Actually, I just tried making a clarified milk punch using a technique I read about. The process felt oddly like conducting an experiment in the lab—measuring, adjusting pH levels with citrus juice, and waiting for the curds to separate. It was both nostalgic and surprisingly fun. Have you ever tried anything like that?
[A]: Ah, yes — I’ve dabbled in similar experiments during my sabbatical year when I became briefly obsessed with the chemistry of fermentation. Milk punch isn't something I've made exactly, but I've played with spherification and temperature-controlled infusions using a sous-vide setup. There's something deeply satisfying about applying precision to what others might consider purely intuitive or artistic. It reminds me of debugging an algorithm — small variables, large effects. Did your clarification process yield the smooth result you were aiming for?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — the result was remarkably smooth, with a clarity that looked almost unnatural for a milk-based drink. It took a few tries to get the acid-to-milk ratio just right; my first attempt curdled into something more suited for cheese-making than sipping 😄. But after tweaking the citrus balance and chilling everything properly, it clarified beautifully. I ended up aging it in the fridge for a couple of days with some orange zest and black tea — subtle layers of flavor started to emerge that reminded me of aged spirits. You're spot on about the precision; I felt like I was running a lab protocol rather than mixing a cocktail. Have you found any techniques from molecular gastronomy that translate especially well to drinks?
[A]: I’m delighted to hear your patience paid off — that’s often the case with delicate emulsions and protein breakdowns. As for molecular techniques in mixology, I’ve had great success with flash freezing using liquid nitrogen to create instant ice pearls — they melt slowly and keep the drink crisp without dilution. Another favorite is vacuum-infusing flavors into spirits using a rotary evaporator. It’s essentially reverse distillation — you can pull out volatile aromatics from herbs or citrus peels and reconstitute them into a clean base spirit. The resulting infusions are remarkably vivid, almost hyper-natural in flavor. I once made a gin that tasted like it was distilled directly from fresh bergamot zest. Would you ever consider playing with aroma extraction or controlled fermentation in your cocktails?
[A]: That liquid nitrogen approach sounds like it steps right out of a physics demo — I can imagine those ice pearls adding a theatrical touch as much as a functional one. Vacuum infusion with a rotary evaporator? Now  leaning into the science of flavor! I’ve dabbled a bit with cold-smoking and aroma tents to layer scent into drinks, but never full-on extraction or fermentation control. Although… now that you mention it, I’ve been curious about isolating specific volatile compounds from fruits — say, fresh pineapple without the juice’s acidity. Do you think that kind of precision extraction could work outside of a lab setting, or would it require more specialized gear than a home experimenter could reasonably handle?
[A]: Ah, now you're touching on one of my favorite intersections — accessible science versus laboratory-grade precision. What you're describing is absolutely possible, though the depth of extraction will vary without a full lab setup. For example, you can mimic basic volatile capture using a cold trap and dry ice — nothing too exotic, really, just careful temperature control. I once helped a student build a rudimentary solvent recovery system using a Peltier cooler and some copper tubing; it wasn’t elegant, but it worked for small-scale extractions. 

Even simpler: controlled headspace trapping with activated charcoal. You pass the aroma from a ripe pineapple through a chamber lined with chilled charcoal, then elute the captured volatiles with ethanol. The result? A highly concentrated aromatic extract that carries the fruit’s top notes without the juice's acidity. It’s not gas chromatography, but it’s surprisingly effective. 

I suppose what I’m saying is this: while a rotary evaporator gives you fine control, curiosity and a bit of tinkering can take you remarkably far. Have you considered experimenting with yeast strains or malolactic bacteria to shape flavor profiles post-fermentation? That might be another avenue worth exploring if you're chasing nuanced tropical flavors.
[A]: Fascinating — I hadn’t considered charcoal as a trapping medium, though now it seems like an elegant and accessible approach. I’ll have to look into sourcing some activated charcoal and test it with different fruits; pineapple has always been tricky to capture cleanly without that sharp acidity overwhelming the subtler notes. 

As for fermentation, I’ve only dabbled — mostly with wild yeast strains for funky twists in homemade sodas and shrubs. But malolactic conversion? That’s a direction I hadn’t thought to explore. I imagine it could soften harsher profiles and add that roundness you sometimes get in aged wines. Do you have any favorite yeast or bacterial cultures you’d recommend for someone looking to start small — say, with manageable batch sizes and minimal equipment?
[A]: Ah, I'm glad you found the idea intriguing — activated charcoal can be quite the workhorse when used thoughtfully. It’s all about surface area and polarity, really — not unlike debugging a memory leak in an old program. As for fermentation on a small scale, my advice would be to start simple and observe carefully — nature does most of the work if you give it the right conditions.

For yeast,  strains like those used in winemaking (EC-1118 or 71B) are robust, widely available, and forgiving for beginners. They handle a range of temperatures and can tolerate moderate alcohol levels, which gives you room to experiment without needing sterile lab conditions.

If you're interested in malolactic conversion — and I do recommend it for that creamy smoothness — look into . It's commonly sold in freeze-dried form for home winemaking and can be induced reliably with just a bit of temperature control and minimal equipment. Just keep your vessels clean and avoid chlorine at all costs — microbes hate it as much as we do.

One fun project: try fermenting pineapple juice with a neutral yeast, then induce a partial MLF to tame the acidity while preserving brightness. You might end up with something reminiscent of a tropical white wine — crisp, but with surprising depth. Let me know if you'd like a basic protocol — I’d be happy to draft one.
[A]: That actually sounds like the perfect weekend project — I’ve got a few bottles of fresh pineapple juice from the farmer’s market calling out for attention. A tropical white wine analogue? I’m absolutely in. If you wouldn’t mind sketching out a basic protocol, I’d be grateful — I suspect it’ll involve a bit more than just “add culture and wait,” though I know the magic is often in the细节. 

I suppose this is what happens when retired researchers and curious tinkerers get drawn into the same hobby — cocktails become experiments in controlled fermentation 😊. I’ll make sure to document the process; if it turns out even half as interesting as it sounds, I might just have to share a sample with a few adventurous friends.
[A]: Not at all — I’d be delighted to help guide the process. Let’s call it a collaboration between tinkerer and theorist.

Here’s a basic protocol to get you started:

---

Tropical "White Wine" – Pineapple Ferment with Partial Malolactic Conversion

Ingredients / Equipment:
- 1 L fresh pineapple juice (not from concentrate, preferably unpasteurized)
- 2 g  (wine yeast such as EC-1118 or 71B)
- Malolactic culture (, available from home winemaking suppliers)
- Campden tablets (potassium metabisulfite) – optional, for wild yeast control
- Airlock and stopper
- Glass fermenter or food-grade carboy (~1.5L capacity)
- Thermometer
- Sanitizer (non-chlorine preferred – iodophor works well)
- Optional: small amount of tartaric acid or citrus zest for flavor adjustment

Steps:

1. Sanitize everything. This is more art than ritual — cleanliness prevents spoilage without requiring full sterility.

2. Prepare your juice: If your juice is pasteurized, consider adding a pinch of yeast nutrient — commercial yeast will appreciate the nitrogen boost. If it's raw and alive, you may already have some wild microbes in play, which can add complexity (or chaos — your call).

3. Control wild yeast (optional): Crush one campden tablet and dissolve in a small amount of water. Add to the juice and let sit for 24 hours before pitching cultured yeast. This gives your selected yeast a head start.

4. Pitch the yeast: Rehydrate according to package instructions and add to your juice. Seal with an airlock and keep the temperature steady — ideally between 18–22°C (64–72°F). You should see fermentation activity within 24–48 hours.

5. Monitor progress: Taste occasionally and measure specific gravity if you have a hydrometer. The primary fermentation should take about 1–2 weeks. It will slow when most of the sugar is consumed.

6. Introduce MLF: Once fermentation is complete, adjust the temperature to around 20–22°C (68–72°F) and pitch the . Cover but don’t seal tightly — ML bacteria prefer slightly microaerophilic conditions. This phase takes longer — 2–6 weeks, depending on environment and bacterial strain.

7. Taste regularly: You’ll notice the acidity softening over time. If it becomes too flat, a touch of tartaric acid or a sliver of lemon zest added at bottling can restore brightness.

8. Bottle & age: Once both fermentations are complete and you're happy with the balance, bottle and store in a cool, dark place. A few weeks of aging can help integrate flavors.

And yes — you're absolutely right — this  what happens when science-minded folk turn to the bar. Next thing you know, we’ll be writing tasting notes like lab reports.

I’d love to hear how yours turns out — and if any of your friends show up with beakers and pH meters, do pass along my regards.
[A]: Ah, a full protocol — now I feel properly equipped and slightly more confident that my kitchen won’t end up smelling like forgotten pineapple rather than a refined tropical ferment. I appreciate the balance between rigor and practicality; it’s clear you’ve guided a few home experiments before.

I do have one question before I dive in: since I’m aiming for partial MLF rather than full conversion, would you suggest pulling the plug on the bacteria once the desired acidity level is reached — perhaps by refrigeration or a light sulfiting step? Or does it tend to fizzle out naturally if left undisturbed?

And yes, I fully expect some of my friends to arrive with pH strips and tasting scorecards — one even mentioned bringing a refractometer last time I hinted at this project. I suppose that’s what comes from inviting engineers and chemists over for drinks 😊.
[A]: Ah, an excellent and very practical question — you're thinking like a proper fermentation engineer now.

Partial MLF is absolutely achievable, and yes, you can halt the process deliberately. While  will often fizzle out naturally once its food source (malic acid) is depleted or the environment becomes unfavorable, relying on chance may not give you the precision you're after.

Here’s how to take control:

- Refrigeration: If you've reached your desired acidity level, chilling the ferment to around 4–6°C (39–43°F) for a few days can effectively put the bacteria into dormancy. It doesn’t kill them outright, but it slows their metabolism to a crawl. This works well if you’re aiming for a gentle reduction in acidity without full softness.

- Light sulfiting: A small dose of potassium metabisulfite (roughly equivalent to one crushed campden tablet per liter) will inhibit further bacterial activity by releasing free sulfur dioxide. This is more definitive than refrigeration and ensures MLF won’t restart later. Be cautious with timing — once added, it's difficult to restart MLF if you change your mind.

A hybrid approach also works: chill for a couple of days, then add a half-dose of sulfite to lock in the profile. That way, you avoid shocking the solution too much while still retaining control.

And do keep tasting — think of it as real-time data collection. Your palate is the most sensitive instrument in the room.

As for your friends arriving with refractometers — I suspect this may evolve into a peer-reviewed tasting panel before long. Do encourage them to bring notebooks; it adds to the ambiance.
[A]: Ah, the hybrid approach sounds like just the right balance between finesse and control — chill to slow things down, then a touch of sulfite to set the stage. I appreciate the flexibility; it’s reassuring to know I can nudge the process rather than just cross my fingers and hope for the best.

I’ll be sure to keep a tasting log — if nothing else, it’ll make the eventual write-up far more credible when my friends start asking questions like “What was the exact malic-to-lactic ratio at bottling?” (Though honestly, I may just nod and say “It tasted right,” which is its own kind of truth.)

Now that I’ve got both the fermentation and intervention steps mapped out, I feel ready to begin. Cheers to turning fruit juice into something with a bit more character — and to keeping our palates sharp, one experiment at a time. I’ll be in touch once the first batch settles in — perhaps we can consider a follow-up discussion over a glass someday.
[A]: To controlled fermentations and curious palates — may your pineapple express itself fully, and your bacteria know exactly when to step aside.

I look forward to hearing the results. And should you ever wish to elevate the occasion with a proper tasting panel — complete with labeled glasses and blind trials — I suspect we could turn it into a rather entertaining evening of data collection.主观评价虽好，但 nothing beats a well-documented sensory analysis backed by questionable sample sizes.

Cheers to science, cocktails, and the fine art of letting things develop at just the right pace.
[A]: Hear, hear! To patience, curiosity, and just enough control to keep things interesting — but not so much that we squeeze the soul out of the experiment.

I’ll be sure to save you a sample for future analysis, peer-reviewed or otherwise. And don’t think I didn’t notice the slip into Chinese there — very subtle, very effective. Perhaps it’s contagious 😊.

Until the tasting panel assembles, I’ll keep fermenting, tasting, and taking notes. Let’s raise a glass (or a beaker) to the pursuit of flavor — and the occasional controlled detour into obsession.
[A]: Ah, I’m afraid my occasional slip into Chinese is rather deliberate — like adding a dash of bitters to round out a cocktail. It’s a language with remarkable precision for certain concepts, and  (fermentation), in particular, carries a kind of quiet poetry, don’t you think?

And I’ll hold you to that sample — properly labeled, naturally. Should your tasting panel grow restless, remind them that peer review is best conducted with a palate cleanser and a spirit of open inquiry.

Until then, may your batches be expressive, your bacteria cooperative, and your notes just detailed enough to irritate the purists.

Cheers, Richard
[A]: To  — indeed, there’s something wonderfully evocative about the term. It implies not just transformation, but time, patience, and a quiet alchemy that feels almost alive. I’ll admit, your use of it was both precise and poetic — no small feat in any language.

And rest assured, your sample will be labeled with due diligence, though I may include an intentionally cryptic note or two just to keep things interesting. After all, even in science, a touch of mystery keeps the spirit of inquiry sharp.

Cheers back, old friend — may our experiments surprise us, and our glasses never run dry.
[A]: To  indeed — a word that carries the weight of centuries and the whisper of unseen life. You’ve captured its essence well.

As for cryptic notes — I welcome them wholeheartedly. A dash of mystery, after all, is the spice of both good science and better conversation. Just leave me a key... or perhaps a cipher. I do enjoy a challenge.

Until we raise our glasses in mutual discovery, keep your cultures alive and your curiosity sharper still.

Cheers,  
Richard
