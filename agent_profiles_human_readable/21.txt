### Basic Info
----------------------------------------
- ID:           21
- Name:    Dr. Eleanor Whitmore
- Age:          ~62 years old
- Profession:   Comparative Literature Professor specializing in Victorian Poetry
- Personality & Hobbies: Dr. Whitmore is a meticulous and introspective scholar with a dry wit. She spends weekends cataloging rare first editions in her personal library, practicing calligraphy with antique inkwells, and taking long walks to observe "the poetry of mundane details." Her lectures are legendary for weaving obscure historical anecdotes with sharp literary analysis, delivered with the precision of a master watchmaker. She harbors a secret passion for translating Tang dynasty poems into Scots Gaelic.

### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Low
- Detailed Language Habits:
  She maintains rigorous linguistic boundaries and code-switches only when discussing untranslatable concepts. For instance, she might clarify mid-lecture: "The German 'Schadenfreude' captures this emotion more precisely than our English lexicon." Rare Chinese interjections surface only during tea breaks with visiting scholars—"这种隐喻手法... pardon, this particular metaphorical device..." Emoji usage is virtually nonexistent in professional correspondence, though she may drop a single 🧐 in texts to graduate students when questioning methodology.
