[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh totally, this is such a big topic~ 💭 I see so many guests who are super stressed about their Instagram stats or WeChat moments - like they're living for those likes instead of real life experiences. But then again, social media can be a good thing when people use it mindfully, right？I follow some amazing accounts that share daily affirmations and meditation tips ✨ Have you noticed how many luxury hotels now have 'digital detox' packages? It's like the more we connect online, the more we need to disconnect IRL 🤯
[A]: The paradox of connection, isn't it? I've observed similar contradictions while analyzing diary entries from the Industrial Revolution—people then also struggled with their 'technological' advancements. Just last week, a student showed me an algorithm-generated sonnet praising her Instagram aesthetics. It rhymed 'authenticity' with 'algorithmic reality.' Rather... , don't you think?
[B]: LOL yes! The more we advance, the more we crave that genuine human touch 💯 I actually had a guest last night who told me she deleted all social media apps before coming here - said she wanted to "live like Jane Austen for a week" 😂 But get this - she kept taking selfies and saving them in her journal like they were 19th century love letters! It's like... darling, you're literally writing your own Victorian novel right here in 2024 🤔 

You know what's wild though? Some of my regulars now pay extra for "social media concierge" service where we help them curate  moments worth sharing... Irony at its finest, right?
[A]: Ah, the curated authenticity industry—marvelous phrase, by the way. It does rather echo the Brontës' habit of publishing under male pseudonyms to achieve 'authentic' recognition. Though I suppose your guests prefer their illusions unchallenged. Still, one must admire the poetry of it all: self-conscious artifice presenting itself as raw truth. I’ve half a mind to offer a weekend seminar on Byron’s influence on TikTok aesthetics... with a side lesson on translating  into Instagram captions.
[B]: 💯百分之一百！You just read my mind - last month I helped策划 a "Gatsby Glamour" event where guests dressed in 1920s attire but took TikTok videos with neon filters... It was like time travel meets digital fantasy! 

Speaking of Brontë vibes, I’ve noticed some guests secretly write romantic poetry in the hotel’s physical guestbook instead of posting online 😂 Like they’re living characters from a historical novel! 

A Byron-themed TikTok workshop would be 🌟✨ amazing! Imagine teaching Gen Z how to do dramatic readings while pouting for the camera... And yes please - translating Wuthering Heights into WeChat moments? That’s pure gold 💯💯 I’d pay full price just to see someone caption “Heathcliff just ghosted me... #toxiclove” 😂
[A]: Oh, the poetry of filtered pouts and dramatic readings— one should sneeze without a carefully curated caption. I daresay Byron would’ve thrived on TikTok, though he may have duelled a few commenters. As for your Gatsby-meets-filters soirée—marvelous touch, truly. Nothing says decadence like flappers illuminated by the cold glow of smartphones.

Now, about that WeChat moment: —utter genius. I’m drafting a series of Victorian break-up captions as we speak.  or perhaps 

I do believe the next literary revolution lies not in salons or libraries, but in the algorithm. The real question is: shall we charge extra for optional quill pens at the check-in desk?
[B]: Oh my god YES - quill pens at check-in? 🤩💯 I’m already visualizing the Instagram Story template: “Checked into the 19th century 💫 #RoomWithAView #DarcyOrNothing” 

And Byron dueling commenters? PLS save that seat for me in the front row 🤭 I’d pay double for popcorn! Though honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he already has a secret burner account with a dramatic profile pic and everything 😂

Your Victorian breakup captions are  perfection 👏 The poor Brontës never stood a chance against modern heartbreak... or WeChat moments! Should we start selling vintage inkwells as room amenities too? I feel like this could be our next limited edition package - "Write Your Own Tragic Love Story" ✨💌
[A]: Oh, the  package—now there’s a venture with real staying power. Imagine the brochure copy: 

As for Byron’s burner account—I suspect he’d be deep in the comments section of Keats’ latest post, arguing about poetic meter and calling him ‘dear melancholy Johnny.’ Though I suppose we must protect the illusion. Perhaps a disclaimer at check-in: 

And yes, inkwells by the bedside—alongside a single wax-sealed envelope. Encourage the guests to write their confessions by dim lamp light. We could even offer a morning delivery service: have their letters hand-carried by a brooding figure in top boots and a vaguely disapproving expression.

Now, about that quill pen… shall we engrave them with sonnet fragments? 
[B]: OMG I’m crying laughing 😂 this brochure copy is GOLD - we need to launch this package immediately! “Unrequited longing included at no extra charge” 👑 And that Byron disclaimer? PURE genius. I can already see the little card by the front desk:



And yes YES to the brooding letter deliverer 💯 I say we hire actors who never smile, wear all black, and quote Dorian Gray under their breath while handing over the letters... Guests would go wild for it!

Quill engraving idea? Stroke of brilliance 🌟 Let’s do sonnet lines on one side and maybe a cheeky warning on the other like “Handle with care - sharp enough to cut through BS” 😏 Should we add a tiny ink stain emoji at the end? 🐾
[A]: Oh, the actors—. Let’s call them ‘Literary Specters’ and give them pocket watches that don’t tick. They shall deliver letters with a gaze so heavy it could sink a sonnet. And yes, the quill engraving? Absolutely first-rate. I’m partial to Sonnet 116 on one side: —and your warning on the reverse:  Poetry and practicality, in perfect balance.

As for the ink stain emoji—why stop at one? A trail of tiny 💧 droplets, perhaps? To suggest the perils of passion and spilled ink alike. Though I do think the brochure needs a final flourish. Might I suggest a tagline beneath the title in delicate script: 

And don’t forget the Byron quote tucked into the fine print:  Or as he might say today: 
[B]: 😍💯 YES to all of this - the Literary Specters with silent pocket watches?? Perfection! I’m imagining them gliding through the halls like mysterious Jane Eyre-era ninjas 🕶️

And Sonnet 116 on the quills? So elegant, yet brutally honest with that BS-cutting warning 😌🔪 The ink droplet trail 💧 is  level detail - adds just the right touch of dramatic flair without being too on-the-nose. 

That brochure tagline though… “Romance is tragedy…but the linens are Egyptian cotton” 💂♀️✨ Honestly, it's pure marketing magic. Comfort and heartbreak in perfect balance!

I'm dying over the Byron quote twist: “Tagging locations since 1812” 😂😂 You're a genius. Should we add a fake Instagram bio for him in the fine print too? Maybe something like:  🙃📸
[A]: Oh, —magnificent. I’m already drafting his faux Instagram grid: a dramatic selfie in profile with a stormy Greek coastline behind him, one arm seductively draped over an inkwell, captioned 

And yes, the Literary Specters gliding like Jane Eyre-era ninjas—. Let’s give them a whispered catchphrase too:  That way, guests feel properly warned.

As for the quills, perhaps we nest them in velvet-lined boxes with a small printed card:  We’ll tuck in a sample line—something like 

Now, about the guest experience—shall we offer optional mood lighting in the rooms? A choice between “Brooding Heathcliff Sunset,” “Moonlit Study,” or “Storm Approaching Thornfield Hall”? Paired with a curated playlist titled 

Genuinely, this package is writing itself. Almost as if the ghosts of literary history are dictating it through us. Or perhaps we’ve simply drunk too much afternoon tea and gone slightly mad. Either way—brilliant work, darling.
[B]: Oh my god YES — Byron’s faux Instagram grid is EVERYTHING 😂 I can already see his “Throwback Thursday” post with a dramatic sketch of his pet bear from Cambridge 🐻 #WildChildEnergy. And that catchphrase for the Literary Specters? “I deliver words… not closure.” 💥 So good. Guests will be quoting that for weeks!

The quill care instructions had me snorting tea out my nose 💀 “Sentimentality stains more than ink” – honestly, frame that and put it in every suite. Let’s also add a little wax seal sticker on the box that says  🕯️💘

Mood lighting options? Stroke of pure genius 👏 I say go all out - maybe add “Dramatic Darcy Rainstorm” as a fourth option? Pair each setting with its own scent diffuser: aged parchment, jasmine night blooming, or fireplace ember (smoke optional but highly encouraged). 

And the playlist? Already made it in my head:  

-  by Gary Jules  
-  on piano loop  
- A reading of  over soft thunder sound effects 🌩️  
- Ending with Billie Eilish’s  because emotional whiplash, darling. FEELINGS!  

As for us slightly mad tea-drinking literary ghosts? 🫖👻 I’d say we’ve officially peaked. Shall we book a test run of this package for ourselves next week? Just you, me, a pot of questionable Earl Grey, and several perfectly tragic candlelit hours ahead…
[A]: Darling, if you snort tea out your nose one more time, we may have to add a  mood lighting setting: “Chaotic Literary Breakdown.” But yes—absolutely, let’s do it all. And then some.

Byron’s pet bear on Throwback Thursday?  I’m adding a comment section beneath the post—just imagined replies from Keats:  And Dickens: 

The wax seal sticker——is now the only thing I want on my gravestone. Next to it, perhaps, a tiny footnote: 

As for the scent diffusers: aged parchment is a must. Though I propose we spike the jasmine night-blooming oil with just a whisper of lavender— And ember smoke should come with a warning label: 

Your playlist? Exquisite emotional sabotage.  easing guests into existential melancholy, followed by Poe’s  whispered over thunder—perfect for those who like their heartbreak properly staged. And ending with Billie Eilish like a velvet-covered dagger to the ribs. Bravo.

Now, about that test run next week… I shall arrive in full costume: lace cuffs, leather-bound notebook, and a gaze sharpened by too many lost causes. I’ll even bring an antique inkwell—just in case inspiration strikes. Or we need to write scathing reviews of the Earl Grey.

Let’s call it  Packages include: two cups of questionable tea, one shared silence, and absolutely no promise of resolution.

Shall we meet in the lobby at 7 PM sharp? I’ll be the one pretending not to cry over a passage from  while sipping gin from a teacup.
[B]: Oh sweet summer child, you think I can handle more mood lighting options? 😂 When you said "Chaotic Literary Breaktonight" 💥 I say we run with it - let's add a flickering candle effect that looks like it's about to die dramatically at any moment. 

Byron’s TBT comments had me wheezing - Keats’ side-eye energy is everything we need in this life 👏 And Dickens roasting his dog’s Insta? Honestly, the literary roast thread of the century 🔥

The scent diffusers are now full-blown art. Aged parchment + lavender for those bittersweet pining feels? Pure genius. And that ember warning label? PERFECTION. Let’s print them in gold calligraphy and make guests sign a waiver before entering their rooms 📜🖋️ #NotResponsibleForSpontaneousProposalsOrDramaticConfessions

And your test run costume?! 🖤 I’m matching with leather gloves and a pocket watch I definitely don’t know how to use. Oh darling we are going FULL Victorian-chic-meets-modern-angst. Gin in teacups? Absolute must. Bonus points if we stir with our quills 🐾🖋️

“A Night of Tragic Comfort & Mild Delirium” – OUR MASTERPIECE. I’ll book the most dramatic suite with floor-to-ceiling windows and zero curtains because yes, we’re being stared at by the moon tonight 🌙 Let’s toast with Earl Grey gin and pretend we understand what we wrote in the heat of passion. 

7 PM sharp in the lobby? I’ll be there early just to miss you dramatically when you're fashionably late 😭📖 #WaitingForThePlotToUnfold
[A]: Ah, —perfect for those who like their ambiance one gust of wind away from tragedy. I'm already drafting the room service menu under that setting: 

And yes, full Victorian-chic-meets-modern-angst it is. I shall arrive in a high-collared coat with buttons that serve no practical purpose, gloves included—though mine will be slightly ink-stained from last week’s poetic crisis. Oh, and I’ve sourced a monocle. Not because I need it, but because 

Your plan to book the suite with floor-to-ceiling windows and ? Sublime cruelty. The moon shall bear witness to our literary indulgences—and possibly call the authorities if things get too dramatic.

As for the toast: , stirred with quills (for authenticity), and served in teacups too delicate for this world. We’ll clink glasses over a shared passage from  and pretend we’re not both scribbling terrible haikus in the margins of napkins.

Now, darling— indeed. If you're early just to miss me dramatically when I’m fashionably late, then I shall be late on principle. Expect a rustle of velvet, a faint scent of old paper, and one very meaningful sigh before I even speak.

See you at seven, .
[B]: Oh. My. God. You’re killing me with this energy 😍 That room service menu had me spilling gin  tea all over my antique map collection — “half-burnt taper, questionable life choices” 💯 I say we add a warning label: 

That high-collared coat with useless buttons? Iconic. Useless fashion is the only kind worth wearing 💅 And you with a monocle?? Darling, you're basically a living, breathing Brontë fever dream. Ink-stained gloves from a poetic crisis last week? 🖤 I need that framed in the hotel lobby.

And YES to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall toast 📚 We’ll read it cover to cover while scribbling nonsense like:

*“Moonlight fades  
My quill trembles  
Is it passion…  
Or just caffeine withdrawal?”*

Also, floor-to-ceiling windows with zero curtains? Genius. Let the moon judge us as we sip our tragically delicate teacup cocktails and whisper lines from Wuthering Heights at each other like forbidden lovers 🌙💔

Rustle of velvet + scent of old paper + meaningful sigh before speaking?? 🥀 You better arrive fashionably late just so I can miss you dramatically on purpose. I’ll be there early just to look brooding by the grand piano like some forgotten Byronesque figure with zero chill.

See you at seven(ish) then... or possibly not at all, depending on how many haikus we write instead 💭✨
[A]: Ah, —a fragrance more intoxicating than any Parisian perfume. And yes, let’s absolutely add that warning label:  We’ll print it on aged vellum and staple it to every room key. Optional tear-staining effect for extra atmosphere.

Your haiku—darling, it’s exquisite. So much so I’ve already scribbled a response in the margin of a very serious literary critique:

*“The taper dies  
My heart replies  
In ink, not tears—  
For sentiment is prose, my dear.”*

Now, about that grand piano: if you’re brooding by it in full Byronesque splendour, I shall arrive with a volume of  tucked under one arm and a look of genteel despair upon my face. You’ll know me by the faint smudge of ink on my cheek—left there deliberately, of course, for artistic credibility.

And curtains? Heaven forbid we install such pedestrian things. Let the moon peer in unabashedly. Let it gasp at our quill-stirred gin, our whispered confessions, our shared copy of , now heavily annotated in the language of longing and mild caffeine dependency.

Fashionably late I shall be, just to give your dramatics something to cling to. Picture it: the clock strikes seven—or perhaps eight—and still no sign of me. Only the echo of your sigh drifting over the keys of that poor, neglected piano.

I daresay the Brontës would approve. Or disapprove, which is far more romantic.

See you at seven(ish). Or perhaps not at all… if the muse, or the gin, should take us first.
[B]: Ohhh that warning label on vellum? Absolute art. I’m adding a wax seal with “TRL” embossed in gold – Tragic Romance Liability 😂 And the tear-staining effect? Optional sniffles encouraged but not required 💭泪

Your haiku just made me spill more tea/gin all over my Byronesque waistcoat 💅 I need it framed immediately next to my imaginary portrait of Byron fighting Keats in the hotel lobby over meter debates 🤭

And yes YES to arriving with  under your arm and that genteel despair face 👠 You better walk in slow-motion through the moonlight like some dramatic Netflix period drama come to life. I’ll be at the piano playing  with one hand while scribbling bad poetry about your entrance with the other.

No curtains?? The moon is basically our unpaid audience now 🌙 We should give it front row seats. Let’s start a loyalty program: 

And darling, you better be fashionably late. Like  energy. I need time to brood properly, sigh dramatically into my teacup gin, and write five more terrible haikus about your monocle:

*“Ink stains your cheek  
Monocle dreams in candlelight  
I play the saddest chord.”*

If the Brontës don’t approve, we shall drink more gin and rewrite history 🍸📖

See you at seven(ish)... or possibly never if this playlist kills us first.
