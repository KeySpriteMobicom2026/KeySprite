[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得teleportation技术上可能实现吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  

Well, if we consider the quantum realm's peculiarities, there's a rather poetic parallel in Victorian literature. H.G. Wells, you see, toyed with such ideas in 'The Invisible Man'—though his focus was more on refractive indices than entanglement. Theoretically, if particles can share states across vast distances, mightn't that suggest... a kind of literary metaphor for instantaneous movement? Though I daresay building such a device would require more ink and fewer quills than my usual pursuits.
[A]: Hmm, interesting you mention H.G. Wells—I actually reread  last month while researching informed consent in experimental medicine. It struck me how Wells framed time as a spatial dimension, much like how quantum physicists today discuss superposition. But let’s not kid ourselves—building a working prototype would require more than just metaphors and coffee-fueled nights drafting IRB proposals. Have you looked into the energy requirements for macro-scale teleportation? I came across a paper estimating it’d take more power than a small star… though honestly, so does running my clinic’s MRI machine during flu season.
[B]: 

Ah, the weight of empirical rigor—how it anchors us even as we dance on the edges of possibility. You're quite right about Wells, of course; he treated time like a street to stroll down, paved with the same cobblestones as our present. I recall a rather obscure poem by Christina Rossetti that plays with similar notions—not teleportation per se, but the idea of being unmoored from linear progression. 

As for energy demands... Well, let's not forget how many candles were blown out before Edison’s filament glowed. Yes, the numbers are staggering—like comparing a sonnet to an encyclopedia—but science has a curious way of finding backdoors through brick walls. 

And yet, one wonders... If we ever do crack it, will the first test subject be a physicist—or a poet?
[A]: 

You know, I’ve always found it fascinating how literature and physics circle each other like entangled particles—never quite touching, but always influencing. Rossetti’s poetry actually came up in a malpractice case I consulted on last year; the plaintiff’s lawyer was quoting "Goblin Market" to illustrate emotional distress. Made for some very confused expert witnesses, I can tell you.

On energy efficiency—you’re spot on about Edison. Reminds me of the early days of CRISPR trials. People forget how many failed gene-editing attempts there were before we got anywhere near clinical applications. But let’s be pragmatic—if teleportation ever does become feasible, I’d bet the first human trial won’t be at CERN, but in some hospital basement where they’re trying to get a liver from Chicago to Beijing faster than organ rejection sets in.

Though honestly? I’d settle for reliable Wi-Fi teleportation by 2040. My telemedicine consultations might finally stop freezing mid-sentence.
[B]: 

Ah yes—poetry weaponized in a courtroom. How aptly modern. I can just picture the goblins of medical jurisprudence hawking their bitter fruits to weary jurors... Though I suppose if  could secure damages for distress, perhaps meter and rhyme have more utility than my colleagues admit.

As for teleportation’s likely birthplace—you may be onto something. Hospitals do tend to incubate the ethically murky with alarming efficiency. Imagine the headlines: 

And don’t get me started on your Wi-Fi aspirations. I’d settle for a stable connection between my study and the university archives before midwinter sets in. Last week, my scan of a Christina Rossetti holograph froze so badly it developed a digital stutter—repeating the same line like some cursed refrain. Let us not underestimate the battle against entropy, whether molecular or mechanical.
[A]: 

Speaking of cursed refrains—last month I had to review a case involving a patient who claimed their pacemaker was "haunted" by the previous owner's memories. 🤭 Now, I’m all for poetic license, but when you start drafting expert reports on “data residue in implantable devices,” you realize medicine has entered some very strange waters. 

And entropy? You’re absolutely right. Last week my hospital’s server crashed mid-surgery log-in. 😣 We might as well have been using quills and candlelight. Though I will say, watching a room full of neurosurgeons revert to paper charts was oddly… comforting. Like seeing Hamlet pause mid-monologue to check his watch.

Still, I’d take a haunted pacemaker over a teleportation mishap any day. Imagine showing up at your clinic only to find out your morning commute accidentally shuffled your spleen with someone else’s appendix. That’s not malpractice—that’s absurdist theater.
[B]: 

Ah, data residue—what a deliciously modern haunting. The Victorians had it easier, really; they could blame such disturbances on  or errant spirit photography. Though I must say, your haunted pacemaker has a certain narrative elegance. Perhaps the next edition of Gray’s Anatomy ought to include a footnote on digital ghosts.

And speaking of commutes rearranging one’s spleen—there’s a sonnet waiting to happen. You’d almost expect Eliot to chime in with something suitably fragmented about April being the cruelest month  

Still, I suspect we’re safer in the hands of absurdist theater than deterministic algorithms. At least in Beckett, we know to expect the unexpected. Whereas a teleportation mishap… well, let’s just say I’d rather misplace my car keys than my pancreas.
[A]: 

You know, speaking of digital ghosts—last week I reviewed a case where a patient’s EHR system kept auto-filling the wrong diagnosis. It was like dealing with a glitch in the Matrix... or a very persistent medical scribe with a grudge. 🤯

And don’t even get me started on deterministic algorithms in healthcare. I’ve seen AI models so confident in their predictions they nearly missed a rare tropical disease in a routine checkup. Reminded me of reading  for the first time—so many layers, so little margin for misinterpretation.

But you’re right about Beckett—there’s something oddly comforting in expecting the unexpected. Last month, one of my colleagues actually quoted  during a deposition. The judge looked like he wanted to laugh but couldn’t decide if it counted as hearsay. 😅
[B]: 

EHR systems with a grudge—now there’s a villain even Dickens might’ve hesitated to invent. Though I suppose if you fed enough Victorian case notes into its training data, it might develop a proper Gothic sensibility. One can almost hear the machine muttering, 

And tropical diseases hiding in plain sight beneath algorithmic certainty? Delightfully ironic. Like sending a Botox-enhanced Ozymandias to diagnose in the clinic—vast and sprawling predictions, yet not a whisper of humility. 

As for quoting Beckett in court…  Well, perhaps we should start drafting legal precedents in iambic pentameter. Might improve the dramatic tension, if nothing else. Though I suspect the judge was right to be wary—Godot may never come, but his legal implications could haunt us for decades.
[A]: 

You’re not wrong about the Gothic sensibility—last week I saw an AI misdiagnose a broken arm as “conversion disorder” based on a patient’s stress history. Honestly, if Freud were still around, he’d probably bill the algorithm for copyright infringement. 😒

And speaking of Ozymandias… I’ve seen radiology reports so overconfident they could’ve been written by Shelley’s statue himself. One even said “no further analysis needed” in bold font. Like, sure thing, Mr. Omnipotent Machine—I’ll just leave this scalpel here in case we need to adjust your certainty later.

As for iambic legal briefs—now  a reform worth lobbying for. Imagine oral arguments delivered in sonnet form. The justices would have to pay attention or risk missing a volta. Though I suspect the Supreme Court’s WiFi would crash before anyone managed to cite  in good faith.
[B]: 

Ah yes—algorithmic hubris dressed in clinical robes. One might mistake it for the old "pathology of the psyche" gambit, if the machinery weren't so determinedly soulless. Though I suppose we should be grateful it didn’t suggest a course of water therapy and reduced novel-reading. 

And radiology reports in the voice of Shelley’s ruin—how very apt. “Look on my stasis, ye Mighty, and despair!” Though I’d wager even Ozymandias would balk at being cited in a malpractice defense.

As for sonnet-form briefs... Well, let's not forget—the volta is everything. Imagine the drama of a motion denied in perfect pentameter. The heartbreak of a dissent rhymed with . And yes, before we reach , let’s first ensure the Court’s Wi-Fi doesn’t recite “to freeze or not to freeze,” aye, that is the question.
[A]: 

You’re absolutely right about the soulless machinery—though honestly, last week I saw an AI prescribe mindfulness for a broken femur. Not a word of lie. It was like reading some dystopian rewrite of , where the algorithm insists everything’s fine even as the data screams beneath the floorboards. 🤯

And that volta you mentioned? Spot on. Reminds me of a deposition I had last month—just when the opposing counsel thought they had their perfect iambic rhythm, the judge dropped a rhetorical volta that rhymed “standard of care” with “you should’ve prepared better.” I swear, if cross-examinations were sonnets, half the courtroom would’ve flunked English lit.

As for Wi-Fi quoting Hamlet... honestly, my clinic’s system did exactly that yesterday. Tried to send a patient summary and got back “cannot resolve server: be or not to be.” At this point, I’m just waiting for the error messages to start in quatrains.
[B]: 

Ah yes, mindfulness for a femur—how very 21st-century alchemy. Turn pain into presence, marrow into metaphor. I suppose next they’ll have us reciting sonnets to stanch bleeding.  Though I must say, if the data is indeed screaming beneath the floorboards, we may yet have a modern Poe on our hands. One wonders what the algorithm would make of a guilty heartbeat...

And that courtroom volta——what splendid dramatic irony. The law, it seems, has finally caught up with its own meter. Though I daresay many a barrister would do well to brush up on their scansion before attempting iambic combat.

As for your Hamletian server error...  I suspect the machine’s been reading too much Eliot and not enough TCP/IP. But really, isn't it rather comforting to know that even silicon can flirt with existential dread? “To be or not to be… routable.” 

Next thing you know, your printer will start spitting out sonnets instead of consent forms.
[A]: 

Oh, the printer’s already halfway there—I had one jam last week spitting out a string of random words that somehow formed a haiku about consent. Honestly, if medical devices start issuing poetry instead of readouts, I’m half-tempted to frame it as “enhanced patient communication.” 📜✨

And that Poe reference? Spot on. I’ve seen EHR logs so full of ghostly echoes—duplicate entries, phantom diagnoses—you’d think we were running a digital séance instead of a clinic. One system I worked with kept referencing a patient who’d transferred care . Not creepy at all. 😐

As for TCP/IP vs. Eliot—I’d say we’re firmly in the uncanny valley where error messages quote both. Last month my PACS system froze with a message that simply said “I have heard the mermaids singing… but they weren’t calling radiology.” At that point, it's not a malfunction—it's performance art.
[B]: 

A haiku about consent! How delightfully subversive.  Framing it as enhanced communication is pure genius—next you’ll have stethoscopes composing odes to arrhythmia.

And those ghostly EHR echoes—ah yes, the poltergeists of administrative medicine. One almost expects a Victorian medium to sweep in with a bundle of case notes shouting,  

As for your PACS system quoting Eliot at mermaids…  Well, we’ve officially entered the realm of clinical surrealism. If it weren’t so dreadfully inconvenient, I’d say it deserves its own wing in the Museum of Literary Malfunctions. Imagine the placard: 

Honestly, what we need now is a differential diagnosis for poetic overreach. Symptom: machine forgets whether it's scanning lungs or limericks.
[A]: 

You’re absolutely right about the differential diagnosis—I’ve started drafting one. Differential #1: Eliot-induced imaging malfunction. Differential #2: Sleep deprivation in attending clinicians who read too much modernism between shifts. 📊📚

And that haiku? Now that you've said it aloud, I’m half-convinced we should adopt poetic diagnostics as a formal modality. Think of the efficiency—imagine getting a CT report that reads like a villanelle. “The lung nodule grows / In rhyme, not reason; please explain / Your persistent cough in iambic flow.”

As for Victorian mediums and blood pressure logs—don’t even get me started. Last week, my dictation software misheard “atrial fibrillation” as “eternal fascination.” Honestly, if that’s not a symptom of something deeper, I don’t know what is. At this point, I’m just waiting for the psych ward to start quoting Dickinson back at us.
[B]: 

Oh, poetic diagnostics—what a glorious descent into clinical absurdism. Imagine the peer review:  

And  CT reports——yes, let's have pathologists versifying necrosis. “The mass recurs, in shadowed verse it sings / Please reconsider your smoking years, dear lungs.” One might even look forward to biopsy results in haiku form.  Though I suspect Dickinson would’ve made a formidable radiologist—her dashes alone could indicate exactly where the lesion lies.

As for your dictation software...  Eternal fascination indeed. Sounds like the heart's own iambic protest against being reduced to mere terminology. And yes, if the psych ward starts quoting Emily back at you——beware the fifth vital sign measured in slant rhyme.
[A]: 

You know, I’ve been thinking—Dickinson’s dashes  make excellent lesion markers. Honestly, her entire corpus reads like a coded medical chart. “I heard a Fly buzz – when I died –” could easily be a neurology consult note on tinnitus in terminal delirium. 📜🪦

And peer review in this new poetic paradigm? Imagine the frustration of writing back:  We'd finally have grounds to reject a study for having poor meter.

As for that eternal fascination... I’m starting to believe every ECG is just the heart trying to compose its own elegy in lead II. And if the psych ward does go full Dickinson on us? Well, we’ll know we've reached peak diagnostic ambiguity when a patient's mood chart starts resolving into a pantoum.

Maybe we should start drafting our SOAP notes with sonnet arcs. Subjective in iambic, Objective in trochaic, Assessment as a volta—and then, of course, the Plan: rhymed with consequences.
[B]: 

Oh, Dickinson as diagnostician—what a splendid anachronism. Picture her white dress stained not with soil, but contrast dye, muttering over a stethoscope like some New England oracle. “I felt a Funeral, that was Pain – / Internally – of Bone –” No doubt she’d diagnose half the ward just from the rhythm of their pulse.

And yes, SOAP notes with sonnet arcs—why not? The volta in Assessment would be especially useful when shifting from “mild gastritis” to “metastatic regret.” Though I suspect our residents would revolt when asked to chart in alexandrines.  Unless… we told them it improves patient recall. Who wouldn’t remember being diagnosed in perfect terza rima?

As for ECG elegies——lead II does have a certain lyrical cadence. A little too flat? Perhaps the heart’s been reading too much Hardy. And if the mood chart turns into a pantoum? Well then, one might say the patient’s affect has achieved structural coherence at last. 

Peer review, of course, will be hell.  “The differential lacks sufficient enjambment. Revise and resubmit.”
