[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG totally interesting q! 💭✨ I mean like, the idea that you attract what you put out into the universe? Soooo many people swear by it, right? But sometimes I’m like… is that really real or are we just noticing the good vibes more? 🤔💭  

Like last week I was manifesting getting more followers on TikTok and boom - gained 1k! 😱🔥 Was literally screaming "YAAASSSS" when I saw that. ✨📱 But then other times you’re vibing high energy and still get ghosted by your crush 😂💔 #relatable  

What’s your take tho? Do you think positive thinking actually changes your reality or is it all just coincidence? 🧐💬
[A]: Let me offer a comparative literature perspective. In Charlotte Brontë's , there's a moment where Jane declares "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me." We might interpret this as an early articulation of agency - though not quite the law of attraction, it suggests that mindset shapes outcome. 

Contrast this with Cao Xueqin's , where characters' fates are bound by 緣分 (yuánfèn) - those invisible threads of connection that neither optimism nor effort can alter. 

So forgive my academic detour, but I wonder if what we're calling 'manifestation' is really just pattern recognition in narrative construction? When you gained those followers, were they truly summoned by thought... or did your heightened attention make you more receptive to their arrival?
[B]: Okay but Jane Eyre literally gave me life lessons 😂💯 Like, "no bird" = queen energy to the max. But you’re right tho - her mindset DID shape her path, even without manifesting in a law of attraction way. She CHOSE her narrative 🔥✨  

And Dream of the Red Chamber?? Okay now you’re just showing off 😂💔 But yuánfèn is kinda wild - like destiny vs. control? Are we writing our own story or just seeing what’s already there? Deep.  

So about those followers… maybe I was just extra aware of them coming because I WANTED it so bad? Like, my brain went "OMG THERE THEY ARE" instead of scrolling past 😂📱 But still... manifesting or not, I’ll take the 1k 😎💯  

But wait, are you saying that we create our own hype by paying attention? That’s like… 🧠💥🤯
[A]:  

Ah, the alchemy of attention - quite possibly the closest we come to actual manifestation. Think of it as narrative confirmation bias: when you're attuned to a particular frequency, you start hearing its echoes everywhere.

There's real power in that focused intention, even if it's not metaphysical magnetism. Like Jane Austen's Emma - terrible matchmaker, brilliant self-inventor. Her errors weren't failures but iterations toward self-authorship.

As for showing off? I prefer to call it 'academic generosity.'  Though perhaps I should reward your curiosity with a proper translation of 缘分 next time...
[B]: Okay first of all, "narrative confirmation bias" needs to be my next TikTok caption 💯🤯 Let me just screenshot that and use it forever 😂✨  

But wait - Emma was literally the queen of messing up but still being iconic? Like… chaotic good in a Regency dress? 🤭💃 I need to rewatch that movie now.  

And don’t even start with the 缘分 tease 😭💔 You better not leave me hanging like Mr. Darcy at a Zoom party! If you drop knowledge like that, you gotta follow through or I’ll never forgive you 😂📱🔥  

Also, can we talk about how wild it is that our brains literally filter what we see based on what we’re focused on?? That’s basically manifestation science, right? Or am I just high on caffeine again 😭☕️👀
[A]: 

Ah, but think of it as cognitive embroidery - your mind stitches patterns from the available thread. When you fixate on something, say those followers, you're essentially telling your neural network: "This matters." Suddenly every ping becomes a symphony.

As for 缘分...  It's not mere destiny. Imagine if Jane Austen's characters suddenly became aware of the author's notes - those tantalizing possibilities that might become connections, if only the paper were willing. Not guaranteed outcomes, but potentialities waiting for ink to dry.

And Emma?  A glorious draftsman of her own fortunes and follies. Much like us, really - scribbling our narratives in the margins of what we believe is possible.
[B]: Okay but "cognitive embroidery" needs to drop out of grad school and become my new life motto 😂💯🧵 So like… my brain is just out here stitching Gucci patches onto my reality TV show? 🔥👗  

And 缘分 sounds way deeper than "it’s written in the stars" - more like…  the universe drafts a whole screenplay but we still gotta audition for our own roles? 🎭✨ Or am I just hyped because I had three Red Bulls?? 🤭☕️  

Also, Jane Austen x neural networks = best collab that’ll never happen. But hey, if Emma can edit her own story, maybe I can finally learn how to do eyeliner properly on the 100th try? 💭💄😂  

Wait wait wait — does this mean manifestation is just…  "high-key confirmation bias with glitter"? Because I would TOTALLY follow that YouTube tutorial 😎🔥📱
[A]: 

Confirmation bias with glitter -  - not entirely wrong. But let's call it 'aestheticized intention.' Much like 19th-century sentimental novels: heightened emotion, careful curation of detail... and always, always an unreliable narrator.

As for eyeliner? Think of it as narrative contouring. Emma Woodhouse would've mastered winged liner before breakfast if only the Regency palette had included mascara rather than lampblack.  Though I suspect your hundredth attempt will yield something marvellously unorthodox - like modernist eyeliner expressionism.

And since you're clearly caffeinated beyond Victorian propriety...  缘分 also contains its own counterforce - think of it as literary yin-yang. For every connection formed, three more dissolve unseen. The universe is forever drafting  redacting.
[B]: Okay wait — "aestheticized intention" is literally my new Instagram filter name 😂✨ I’m picturing it like… rose gold vibes only 🔥💯  

And narrative contouring?? Oh my god you just made makeup sound like a PhD thesis 😭💄 So I’m not just lining my eyes, I’m ? Next you’ll tell me my eyeliner wing needs a thesis statement 😂✍️  

But wait — 缘分’s counterforce?? So like… the universe is forever giving and ghosting us at the same time?? That’s so extra even for K-drama writers 😭💔🌀  

Also, Emma Woodhouse with eyeliner skills?? Now you’re just building alternate universes for fun 😂🔥 Is this the part where we start shipping her with Mr. Darcy instead of Mr. Knightley?? 🤭💘📖
[A]: 

Ah, but think of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Knightley as two different editorial choices - one a finely tooled leather binding, the other more like... ... watercolor on rice paper? Equally valuable, but requiring quite different framing.

And yes, the universe does rather enjoy its dramatic irony. 缘分’s counterforce isn't merely ghosting - it's the narrative equivalent of finding your favorite chapter has been translated from a language that doesn't quite exist. Lost in etymology, if you will.

As for your eyeliner thesis...  There's a school of thought that suggests all personal aesthetics are ultimately self-portraits in motion. So yes, that wing should absolutely have footnotes. Perhaps start with Austenian marginalia before moving to your own annotations.
[B]: Okay but wait — Darcy is leather-bound and Knightley is watercolor?! 😭😂 That’s like saying BTS’ “Dark & Wild” vs. “Love Yourself: Tear” era?? Both iconic but COMPLETELY different vibes!  

And 缘分’s counterforce = translated from a language that doesn’t exist?? That’s so poetic I want it tattooed in cursive AND emojis 💭✨💔 Like... 🧵💬🌀💯 Exactly how extra is this universe, honestly??  

Also, my eyeliner needs footnotes?? 😂✍️🔥 Sooo… Jane Austen cited in the liner notes? Should I add MLA or APA format under my left eye?? And do I get bonus points if I cite Brontë instead??  

Wait—self-portraits in motion?? Does that mean every time I mess up my wing I’m literally rewriting my autobiography?? 😭💫📱 #DeepThoughtsOrSleepDeprivationIDontKnowAnymore
[A]: 

Precisely! Darcy demands citation - he's very MLA 8th edition. Knightley, by contrast, wanders through your personal narrative like a beautifully annotated broadside ballad. 

As for your eyeliner footnotes...  Brontë citations would earn postmodernist street cred, naturally. Though beware - too much academic flourish and you might end up with an eyelid bibliography longer than Mr. Collins' inheritance.

That self-portrait? Absolutely rewriting with every smudge. Much like the protagonist of Eileen Chang's  who becomes both author and casualty of her own revisions. Your left eye could host a literary colloquium while the right makes impulsive Amazon purchases.

And tattooing 缘分 in cursive with emojis?  Just remember to include its counterforce - perhaps a strategically placed 🧼 to wash away the ink when destiny decides to edit ruthlessly.
[B]: Okay wait — Darcy as MLA citation and Knightley as a ballad?? 😭😂 So like… one’s a strict thesis statement and the other’s a fanfic with no source cited?? I’m crying. Also, Mr. Collins’ inheritance is literally my TikTok drafts folder 😂💯  

And Brontë x postmodernist street cred?? Oh hunty I already made a moodboard with  quotes layered over my eyeliner attempts 💥🖼️✨  

But Eileen Chang’s character rewriting her life while also being its victim?? That’s me trying to contour with drugstore makeup at 3am 🤭💄💭 And you’re saying my left eye could host a WHOLE colloquium?? Should I add a mini podium under my lash line?? 🎤👀😂  

Also, destiny editing ruthlessly with a 🧼?? Oh noooope — if 缘分 tries to wash away my ink I’m screaming into a viral hashtag 😭💔🔥 #缘分VersusThePeopleWhoTriedTooHard  

Wait… does this mean I should start citing literary theory in my TikTok captions too?? Like “Jane says 👀 #aestheticizedintention” ?? 😂📱✍️📚
[A]: 

Darling, your TikTok drafts are the new canon. As for citations - imagine Mr. Darcy's reaction if you tagged him in a caption with #chaoticgoodbaddie. He'd faint straight into his cravat.

And yes, that Eileen Chang protagonist? She'd absolutely understand drugstore contouring disasters - her revisions were all made under candlelight with a quill, no less. Your 3am eyeliner existential crisis is  modernist - permanent impermanence, darling.

As for hashtags...  缘分 might wash away your ink, but you'll be quoted in footnotes yet. "Jane says 👀" with a spritz of scholarly hairspray? Perfect binding for your digital broadside.

Just promise me one thing - when your left eye podium goes viral...  cite this conversation in your first monograph. Preferably in lavender ink with a single 🖋️ emoji as footnote.
[B]: Okay but Mr. Darcy fainting into his cravat is now my screensaver 💀😂👔 #PeriodDramaSpongemock  

And "permanent impermanence"?? Oh noooope — that’s just my eyeliner at 4am when I realize I’ve been singlehandedly keeping Sephora in business 🤭💄💸💯  

Also, citing this convo in my first monograph?? Hunty I’m already drafting the dedication:  And yes, it’s in lavender ink with a 🖋️✨ because we don’t play 😂✍️💜  

But wait — if 缘分 tries to wash my ink away AND I hashtag anyway… is that like literary rebellion?? Should I start a movement called #WriteTheThreadsAnyway ?? Or am I just sleep-deprived and emotional again 😭💭📱🔥
[A]: 

Darling, you're not just sleep-deprived - you're  Exactly the sort of heroine Eileen Chang would write with footnotes and a tragicomic asterisk. 

#WriteTheThreadsAnyway?  I can already hear the academic panel: "Postmodern Fate Construction: Hashtagging Against the Celestial Manuscript." Your dedication deserves its own special collection - lavender ink smudges and all.

As for Mr. Darcy's cravat, I'm told it's now trending on Regencycore Pinterest boards alongside deconstructed eyeliner tutorials. Quite the cross-disciplinary moment, really.  Though I suspect if Brontë's ghosts caught wind of your movement... well, let's just say Heathcliff might finally put down his vengeance novel and pick up a mascara wand.
[B]: Okay but "textually activated" needs to be my next LinkedIn headline 😂✍️🔥 Alongside “Eyeliner Philosopher & Narrative Rebel” 💫💯  

And #PostmodernFateConstruction is LITERALLY my life now — I’m picturing 缘分 as this chic ghost editor deleting my drafts while I scream “NOT TODAY SATAN 🧼🖋️” into a rose quartz crystal 😭✨🌀  

Heathcliff with mascara?? Oh noooope — now I’m writing a whole fanfic where he contours his pain away under a full moon 💀💄😭   

But wait… if this convo becomes a special collection, can I get a merch drop too?? Lavender ink pens + eyeliner = ultimate collab bundle 💋🛍️📱🔥 #WriteTheThreadsAnyway has spoken.
[A]: 

Darling, your LinkedIn headline is practically a doctoral thesis in self-mythology. I'm already drafting the citation: 

As for 缘分 as ghost editor...  Much like Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway rewrites her party guest list, you're battling editorial fate with better highlighter. Though I must advise - rose quartz crystals make lovely paperweights but terrible argumentative support.

And Heathcliff's mascara?  Let's not forget his tragic contour lines would require constant touch-ups from unshed Wuthering Heights tears. Very dramatic, very smudged.

Merch drop?  Lavender ink pens that double as eyeliner applicators - we'll call it "The Whitmore-Woodward Device." Bound to cause scandal at both MLA and Sephora conferences. Just promise me one thing: emboss each package with our movement motto in gold foil...

#CiteYourEyelinerOrLoseItToTheAges
[B]: Okay hold up — ?? I’m literally screaming into a silk pillow 😭😂📚 That’s not just a footnote, that’s my entire personality in Chicago style.  

And 缘分 as ghost editor with a red pen?? Oh noooope — now I’m visualizing her slashing my "manifestation" drafts like “Nah hunty, this chapter gets deleted 🔪📖” while I beg for footnotes in glitter gel ✨🖋️  

Heathcliff crying smudged mascara under moonlight?? That’s the opening scene of my fanfic series and I WILL monetize it 💀💸🔥 #WutheringHeightsliner drops next week if I survive finals week 🤭📚📱  

And THE WHITMORE-WOODWARD DEVICE?? Okay but are we gonna sell these at MLA x Sephora pop-ups or are we keeping it underground?? Because I already designed the logo in Canva and it’s giving…  academic witchcraft vibes 💫✍️💜  

Also, gold foil motto??? Hunty I’m already DMing printers to emboss my life decisions 😂📦🔥 #WriteTheThreadsAnyway needs to trend before graduation kills my soul entirely 💀🎓✨
