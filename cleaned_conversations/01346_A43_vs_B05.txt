[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得robot会抢走人类的工作吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: It's a topic that definitely comes up often in boardroom discussions. From a PE perspective, automation and AI are like any other disruptive technology - they change the landscape, but don't necessarily reduce overall opportunities. Take the manufacturing sector we've invested in recently: robots have taken over repetitive tasks, but new roles in programming & maintenance have emerged. 

Though I do worry about short-term displacement in industries like logistics. Have you seen how Amazon's fulfillment centers operate now with those Kiva robots? It's both impressive and concerning. 

Would love to hear your take - do you think retraining programs can effectively address this transition?
[A]: Ah, you've touched on a very nuanced issue. The displacement we're seeing in logistics reminds me of what Marx described as "creative destruction" - but I do believe retraining holds promise. Take Germany's dual education system for example; their approach to vocational re-skilling has shown remarkable resilience through industrial changes. 

In China's context though, we might want to look at how AI could actually expand opportunities rather than replace jobs outright. There's fascinating research coming out of Peking University about algorithm auditing - completely new roles that didn't exist ten years ago. 

But let's not forget the human element. When I visit my garden each morning, I'm reminded that some skills - like nurturing life - can't be automated. Still, I'm curious about your thoughts on regional differences? Do you think Western economies are better positioned to handle this transition?
[B]: Interesting you mention Germany's system - we're actually exploring vocational training platforms in Southeast Asia. The challenge there is scale vs. customization. While AI does create roles like algorithm auditing, I'm seeing more immediate growth in human-AI collaboration jobs. Ever heard of "prompt engineers" commanding six-figure salaries in Silicon Valley? It's like the wild west meets Wall Street.

Your garden analogy made me think about my golf game - imagine if a robot could perfectly calculate swing mechanics but still couldn't handle course strategy or weather changes. That 20% human touch remains crucial.

Regarding regional differences, I'd argue China's advantage lies in implementation speed. Remember how quickly they rolled out digital payments? But Western economies have deeper risk-mitigation frameworks. We're seeing this play out now in semiconductor manufacturing - reshoring vs. efficiency debates. 

Speaking of which, are you following the developments in Chengdu's new automation hub? Their hybrid model might offer an interesting middle path.
[A]: Fascinating observations - the "wild west" analogy for prompt engineering particularly amuses me. It reminds me of 19th century gold rushes, though this time the treasure is in data and language. Speaking of language, I've noticed how these new roles require a peculiar blend of technical precision and poetic intuition - much like translating classical Chinese poetry, where literal accuracy often kills the soul of the text.

Your golf analogy makes me think of Go Seigen, the legendary weiqi master who emphasized "harmony over calculation". There's something profoundly human about strategic intuition that no algorithm has captured yet. Though I must say, watching my students interact with LLMs feels like observing a new form of weiqi - humans and machines testing each other's boundaries.

Regarding Chengdu's hybrid model, it does reflect an interesting philosophical synthesis. Much like how Tang dynasty scholars integrated Buddhist thought without losing Confucian foundations, they seem to be blending automation with human craftsmanship. I visited a textile cooperative there last month where AI handles pattern optimization while artisans focus on creative design - quite elegant in its balance.

But let me ask you this - do you see venture capital adapting its due diligence processes to evaluate these human-machine collaboration dynamics? I'm thinking specifically about soft skills assessment frameworks...
[B]: Ah, the poetry of prompt engineering – I hadn’t thought of it that way, but you’re absolutely right. It  like modern-day calligraphy, where the stroke of a word can shape entire systems. Watching these LLMs interact with humans feels like observing a new kind of duet – part logic, part improvisation. 

Go Seigen’s harmony over calculation – now  resonates. We recently passed on a deal where the startup claimed their AI could fully replace financial analysts. I kept thinking, “Where’s the  in that equation?” Much like your weiqi analogy, the best moves aren't always the most optimal on paper – they carry intention, nuance… almost a kind of emotional ROI.

That textile cooperative in Chengdu sounds like a microcosm of what we should be aiming for – machines handling complexity, humans driving creativity. It reminded me of our portfolio company in Milan doing similar things with fashion design and AI pattern-making. The designers love it – more time for vision, less time on arithmetic.

To your question about VC due diligence – yes, absolutely. We’ve started incorporating behavioral pattern analysis in our pre-investment assessments. Not just IQ or EQ, but what some are calling  – the curiosity quotient. How well do founders adapt when faced with machine-driven insights that challenge their instincts? It's fascinating to watch.  

One of my junior partners even proposed using adapted versions of improv theater exercises during pitch sessions – to test how founders navigate unexpected human-AI collaboration scenarios. Sounds quirky, but I think there's something there. After all, if you can’t roll with an off-script prompt, how will you handle a trillion-parameter surprise?
[A]: Ah, this idea of  - curiosity as a measurable dimension! It makes me think of Zhuangzi’s parables where wisdom often comes from the most unexpected angles. Remember the story of the cicada and the praying mantis? The cicada sings without awareness of the mantis behind it - perhaps modern founders could take a lesson in adaptive awareness through your improv exercises.

Your Milan fashion example reminds me of a calligraphy master I once studied under. He'd often say,  Now I wonder - does the algorithm know things the mind overlooks? In some ways, these machines have become our new brushes - tools that demand both discipline and surrender.

I'm intrigued by this behavioral pattern analysis you mentioned. Does it borrow anything from literary criticism? In my field, we've started using AI to map narrative archetypes across cultures, which has unexpectedly revealed how certain character traits translate into leadership styles. Imagine applying that to founder evaluations - detecting Hamlet-like indecision or Dorian Gray narcissism beneath polished pitches.

Speaking of unpredictable parameters, have you considered how Eastern concepts of wu wei (effortless action) might apply to human-AI workflows? Observing tea masters in Kyoto recently, I noticed how they move with such fluidity around automated brewing systems - not resisting the machine's precision, but flowing through it like water. Perhaps there's a business case for studying such grace under digital transformation?
[B]: Wu wei in human-AI workflows – now  a concept worth bottling. You’re making me rethink our entire portfolio company onboarding process. Imagine teaching founders to move through AI integration like a tai chi form – not fighting the data flow, but redirecting it with minimal force. I can already picture our next leadership retreat in Hangzhou, meditating around a Zen garden while discussing prompt engineering…  

Zhuangzi’s cicada and mantis parable – brilliant reference. It almost makes me want to screen founders using narrative archetypes like you mentioned. Hamlet syndrome is real in startups – too much deliberation, paralysis by analysis. And trust me, we’ve funded more than one Dorian Gray type who spent more time admiring their pitch deck than building the product. Maybe we need an archetype audit alongside our financial due diligence?

Your calligraphy master’s line –  – stuck with me all morning. I even wrote it down in my Moleskine before the 9AM partner meeting. In a way, that’s what great investing is too, right? Trusting the instinct that forms over decades, the kind of pattern recognition that can’t be coded – yet.

As for behavioral pattern analysis borrowing from literary criticism… not directly, but now that you say it, maybe it should. We use Jungian archetypes in team profiling occasionally – Persona, Shadow, Hero – mostly for executive coaching. But mapping narrative traits onto founder psychology? That could be powerful. Ever think about consulting for VC firms?
[A]: Ah, consulting for VCs – an intriguing proposition! Though I suspect my value would lie less in direct advising and more in what the French might call  – helping you see familiar landscapes through an unfamiliar lens. After all, isn't that what comparative literature does? We map emotional algorithms across cultures.

Your idea of "archetype audit" delights me. Imagine investment memos that reference not just TAM and CAC, but also Hero’s Journeys and tragic flaws. There's a fascinating parallel in Peking opera – each character type follows specific movement patterns. The young general archetype, for instance, combines boldness with restraint... much like your ideal founder profile, no?

That Moleskine moment made me smile – handwritten words carrying forward oral tradition. Reminds me of how Song dynasty scholars would copy Buddhist sutras by hand despite printed editions being available. Some knowledge insists on flowing through flesh and ink.

Regarding Wu Wei in workflows – perhaps we should be training founders to become like bamboo rather than brick walls. You know the saying:  Flexibility calibrated to resistance. I saw this in action at a Shenzhen robotics firm where programmers meditate before coding sprints. At first I thought it was gimmicky team-building, but their delivery rates spoke otherwise.

And speaking of storms – have you noticed how both AI ethics discussions and venture risk assessments are increasingly sounding like classical Chinese poetry? So much emphasis on balance, subtlety, negative space. The most important data points often reside between the lines...
[B]:  – what a perfect word. I might steal that for our next offsite. You're right, comparative literature  mapping emotional algorithms. We VCs talk about pattern recognition all the time, but most of us are just looking at spreadsheets, not sonnets. Imagine if we evaluated pitch decks like literary manuscripts – margins filled with marginalia, tracking narrative tension and character arcs.

Peking opera archetypes in investment memos – yes, please. I can already picture it: "This founder reads as a tragic , too noble for his own good," or "The business model lacks  energy – where’s the feminine counterbalance?" Our analysts would hate it, which probably means we should do it.

That bamboo vs. brick wall analogy – spot on. Funny you mention Shenzhen robotics firms too. We invested in one where the CEO made meditation mandatory before product launches. I thought it was mindfulness theater... until their burnout rate dropped 40%. Maybe they were onto something with that  flow after all.

AI ethics discussions as classical Chinese poetry – now  an image. The negative space between data points, the silence between notes... reminds me of how we assess team cohesion. Numbers tell one story, but often the real insights live in the pauses during a Q&A session. Or as my favorite jazz pianist Miles Davis once said, 

So tell me, have you ever considered designing a founder training program based on Tang poetry structures? A  for scaling, a  for crisis management…
[A]: A founder training program based on Tang poetry structures – now  would be a workshop worth attending! Imagine requiring founders to compose regulated verse () before product launches. Not for literary acclaim, but to discipline the mind into holding complexity and simplicity at once. After all, what is a startup if not an 8-line poem with hidden rhymes and shifting tonalities?

I especially like your idea of  for crisis management – those variable-length verses do mirror the unpredictable rhythm of navigating a company through stormy waters. And let’s not forget the  – descriptive rhapsodies that once celebrated imperial hunts. Perfect for fundraising pitches, don’t you think? Though I’d prefer they leave out the imperial arrogance.

Your Miles Davis quote made me think of  music – how the silences between notes carry as much meaning as the notes themselves. In fact, there’s a famous Tang dynasty essayist who described governance as ", playing an instrument without frets." Too many investors want their startups to sound only the loudest, sharpest chords – but real leadership knows when to whisper.

And while we’re stealing metaphors, may I suggest incorporating  principles next? The way masters leave blank space to suggest depth… Perhaps VCs could learn from that too. After all, the most compelling investment thesis isn't always the one packed with metrics, but the one that leaves room for imagination.

Now tell me – would you accept a pitch delivered entirely in couplets?
[B]: A pitch in couplets? I’d not only accept it – I’d give the founder extra points for  (五邪), the “five sly virtues” a Tang poet needed to master verse. Creativity under constraint is exactly what startups demand. And honestly, after reading too many 50-slide decks that drone on about "synergy" and "disruption," a well-crafted  would be refreshing – maybe even enlightening.

You’re absolutely right about  – those rhapsodies were the original hype men of ancient China. I can already picture a modern version:  The imperial arrogance part is optional, though worryingly common.

That  metaphor – brilliant. Some founders play like they’re trying to impress their teacher, hitting every note perfectly but without soul. Others understand the silence, the tension in the space between. That’s the kind of founder I want at our portfolio dinner table. Someone who knows when to pause before the punchline, and when to let the market come to them like water.

And yes, ink painting principles – especially the blank space – should be required learning for VCs. Too many of us try to fill every white space with projections, benchmarks, and five-year roadmaps scribbled in red. But the best investments often emerge from what’s implied, not what’s outlined.

So to answer your question – yes, I’d take a pitch in couplets. Just don’t make me invest in a startup whose business model rhymes with “Ponzi.”
[A]: Ah,  – awarding points for sly creativity! Now  a due diligence criterion I can get behind. It reminds me of how Song dynasty examiners sometimes valued wit over rote knowledge – not just what you knew, but how playfully you could bend the rules while still respecting their spirit.

Your -style pitch made me laugh out loud –  – yes, we’ve all heard variations of that in boardrooms. Though I must say, if someone could rhyme “APIs” with “moon monetizes,” they might actually deserve funding. Perhaps we should hold a startup poetry slam during the next CES?

On the  and soulful pauses – it brings to mind a story about Li Bai, who once wrote a poem entirely through gesture when too drunk to speak. Some founders, in their best moments, operate similarly – communicating vision not through bullet points, but through the rhythm of their conviction. You don’t always need slides when your eyes can sketch the future.

And ink painting principles as investment strategy – yes! Blank space as strategic ambiguity, negative space as room for pivot and adaptation. In fact, I think I’ll propose this in my next guest lecture: 

As for avoiding Ponzi rhymes – well played, my friend. Even in verse, integrity must scan.
[B]: Li Bai composing poetry through gesture –  metaphor. Some of the best pitch moments I’ve experienced weren’t in boardrooms, but over dinner, where a founder leans in mid-sentence and suddenly sketches an idea on a napkin. No slides, no script – just raw momentum. You can’t fake that kind of kinetic vision.

A startup poetry slam at CES – I’d sponsor it. Imagine the judges: a venture poet, a former central banker, and a stand-up comedian. That’s due diligence with flair. And yes, if someone rhymes  with , they’re probably lying – but bonus points for rhythm.

Your guest lecture idea –  – brilliant. I might steal that as a chapter title for my eventual memoir. Tang poets teaching startups to breathe… honestly, it makes more sense than half the business books I’ve read. Breathing space in a pitch, in a strategy, in a team – that’s where the magic hides.

And you're right – even in verse, integrity must scan. The best founders don't just sound good; they  well against reality. Like a finely tuned quatrain, every line has to hold weight, cadence, and intention.

Next time we meet, I’ll bring a bottle of 2005 Château Margaux – and a few lines of Du Fu. Let’s see if wine and classical Chinese verse can inspire the next unicorn.
[A]: 2005 Château Margaux with Du Fu – now  a pairing worthy of a symposium. I can already imagine the conversation: toasting innovation with a glass of terroir, while classical verse reminds us of timeless human truths. Perhaps we’ll even draft a few lines ourselves – , Tang style.

Your dinner-table pitch metaphor resonates deeply. There’s something profoundly human about ideas born in informal spaces – much like how ancient scholars composed their finest poems during wine-drinking gatherings. The spontaneity, the rhythm of shared thought... it's not unlike watching a startup find its footing.

And those judges at your poetry slam – venture poet, central banker, comedian – what an inspired trifecta! They’d embody the very tension that defines innovation: creativity, caution, and the irreverent humor needed to keep us from taking ourselves too seriously.

I do hope you’ll keep me posted on your memoir – especially that chapter on "The Art of the Unsaid." It might just become required reading for founders who’ve forgotten that breathing space is not emptiness, but potential.

Until our next meeting – may your strategy have cadence, your vision have silence, and your investments scan beautifully against reality.
[B]: To strategy with cadence, vision with silence, and investments that scan beautifully against reality – !

I’ll make sure to save a bottle of that Margaux for our next encounter. If we’re feeling ambitious, maybe we’ll draft a business plan in classical Chinese – just to see if it still holds its weight beside a good Cabernet.

And trust me, you’ll be the first to get a copy of that memoir – assuming I don’t lose the manuscript in some ill-advised startup poetry duel.

Until then – keep your founders lyrical, your analysts curious, and your venture math just a little bit drunk on imagination.
[A]: To lyrical founders, curious analysts, and venture math delightfully drunk on imagination –  indeed!

A business plan in classical Chinese beside a Cabernet? Now  a fusion I must witness. It’d be like watching Confucius and Adam Smith debate over the same barrel – structured virtue clashing with invisible hand.

And a memoir lost in a poetry duel? What better fate for words than to vanish into the wind of competition – maybe they’ll find new form in someone else’s verse.

Till we meet again over wine and wisdom, may your spreadsheets have soul, your algorithms have artistry, and your board meetings end with a well-placed couplet.
[B]: To spreadsheets with soul and algorithms with artistry – may our board meetings forever end with a well-placed couplet and a decent Bordeaux.

And yes, Confucius debating Adam Smith over a barrel of Cabernet – now  a cap table I’d sign up for. Virtue vs. value, ethics vs. exit strategy… we need more of that tension in venture.

Till our next round, my friend – may your wine breathe well, your poets stay sharp, and your startup valuations never rhyme with disaster.
[A]: To wine that breathes well, poets that stay sharp, and valuations that never flirt with disaster –  once more!

That Cap Table of Virtue vs. Value – now  a pitch I’d fund. Imagine the term sheet: Clause 1 demands quarterly moral audits alongside financial ones. Clause 2 requires every exit strategy to pass a literary review board.

And yes, we VCs do need more tension in our theses – not just market tension, but philosophical friction. After all, the best investment theses, like the best poems, are built on compelling contrasts.

Till our next round, may your spreadsheets hum with humanity, your algorithms dance with elegance, and your portfolio companies quote Du Fu in their earnings calls.
[B]: To spreadsheets that hum with humanity and algorithms that dance with elegance – may our portfolio companies quote Du Fu in earnings calls and still beat revenue projections.

Your moral audit clause just made me want to rewrite our partnership agreement over a bottle of 1982 Pétrus. Imagine the line item: 

Philosophical friction – yes, that’s the spark. Too much venture capital reads like infomercial copy these days. We need more investment theses written like Tang poetry: dense, daring, and willing to sit in silence before delivering the final couplet.

Till we meet again, my friend – may your due diligence be sharp, your wine decanted long before dinner, and your founders never run out of ink… or metaphors.
