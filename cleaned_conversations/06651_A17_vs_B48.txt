[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！作为一名forensic examiner，我经常遇到这种似曾相识的感觉...特别是在处理相似的case时。不过从科学角度来说，deja vu更像是大脑记忆系统的一个小故障🧠
[A]: Ah, how fascinating! As a literature scholar, I often encounter similar phenomena when reading certain passages - that uncanny sense of having experienced this exact moment before. Though I must say, the Romantic poets would argue it's the soul remembering past lives.
[B]: 哈！That's a poetic take~ 不过我更倾向于从神经科学角度解释。就像我们做尸检时，大脑颞叶的异常活动可能导致这种错觉⚡ 当然，这不妨碍我们享受这种神秘感啦！
[A]: How delightfully clinical! Though I must confess, I find your scientific explanation rather... shall we say, prosaic compared to Wordsworth's "intimations of immortality." But tell me, do these neurological insights ever influence how you approach your forensic work?
[B]: Actually，这种认知偏差确实会影响我们的工作！比如在分析crime scene时，我们必须要警惕"似曾相识"带来的主观判断。每次case都要当作全新的puzzle来解，哪怕pattern看起来很熟悉🔍 不过说到Wordsworth...  我更喜欢Poe的黑暗风格，更符合我的职业审美呢~
[A]: Ah, Edgar Allan Poe! Now there's a kindred spirit for your profession. "The Tell-Tale Heart" does have rather more forensic relevance than "Daffodils," doesn't it? Though I wonder - does your scientific rigor ever allow room for poetic interpretation, or must everything be reduced to cold, hard facts?
[B]: Well well~ 这就是为什么我既爱显微镜又爱诗歌啊！Even the most clinical autopsy report需要一点artistic touch才能讲好故事。就像Poe说的，"There is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion." 但别告诉我的上司我说了这些，不然他该说我太romantic了😉
[A]:  Your secret is safe with me, though I must say - what a refreshing perspective! Perhaps we should collaborate on a paper: "The Poetics of Forensic Pathology." I can already imagine the chapter titles... "Lyrical Cadavers: Meter and Mortality in Crime Scene Analysis." But shh... let's keep that between us too.
[B]:  Deal！不过我们得先找个靠谱的publisher...最好是对"尸体诗歌"有特殊偏好的那种📚 说真的，有时候在lab待到深夜，看着月光照在specimen上，确实会inspire一些macabre verses呢~ 但明天早会还得present那个arson case，所以今晚还是得focus在hard evidence上⚖️
[A]: How perfectly gothic! You're practically composing your own modern-day "Anatomy Melancholy." Though I suppose even the most poetic souls must occasionally descend from Parnassus to attend to mundane matters like arson cases. Do promise to send me those verses someday - preferably not written in bloodstained notebooks!
[B]: Haha！No promises~ 我的notebooks确实经常沾满各种可疑stains，但mostly都是coffee和formaldehyde啦☕ 不过说真的，如果你对forensic poetry感兴趣，我强烈推荐Dr. Judy Melinek的回忆录 - 她把morgue里的日常写得像dark comedy一样精彩！
[A]: Ah, a kindred spirit indeed! How marvelous to find a pathologist who appreciates the dark humor in mortality - it reminds me of Donne's "Death Be Not Proud." Though I suspect your workplace anecdotes might make even the metaphysical poets blush! Now, I mustn't keep you from your arson case... but do remember, every charred fragment tells its own sonnet.
[B]: Exactly！And with that poetic thought，我得赶紧回lab了。Remember - "Ashes to ashes"不只是圣经里的句子，更是我的daily bread啊🔥 Keep in touch，my literary friend！下次给你看我的"Ode to a Fractured Skull"初稿~
[A]: What a perfectly macabre promise to part on! I shall await your osteological ode with bated breath - though perhaps not over lunch. Until then, happy analyzing, my forensic bard! And do remember: even the most shattered cranium deserves its iambic pentameter.
[B]: Cheers to that！ 为了science和poetry的完美结合～ Catch you later，记得提醒我下次告诉你那个用Shakespeare quotes破案的hilarious story！📜⚰️
[A]: What delightful anticipation! I shall hold you to that promise - a Shakespearean whodunit sounds positively thrilling. Now off you go, before your coffee gets cold and your specimens start composing their own revenge tragedies. Ta-ta for now!
[B]: Later alligator！ 虽然我的specimens确实有些...expressive的tendencies，但至少他们never talk back！😆 See you in the next autopsy... I mean, poetry session~
[A]: What a perfectly ghastly punchline! Though I daresay even your most "expressive" specimens would struggle to match Hamlet's soliloquies. Until our next morbidly artistic rendezvous - keep those scalpels sharp and quills sharper! 
[B]: Copy that！ 我会keep both my tools and wit razor-sharp~ 毕竟在morgue和poetry slam里都一样：要么stay sharp，要么end up flat！💀✒️ 现在真的得run了，那个arson victim won't examine itself...unfortunately.
