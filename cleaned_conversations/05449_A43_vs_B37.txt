[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 🤔 That’s an interesting question. I think manifestation has some roots in psychological principles, like goal-setting theory & the power of positive thinking. But when it gets too woo-woo, I start to question it. What about you? Do you believe in the law of attraction?
[A]: Hmm, you know, as a scholar of comparative literature, I often approach such ideas through the lens of narrative and belief systems. The concept of manifestation reminds me of what we see in myths and epics across cultures—the idea that thoughts shape reality is ancient, from the Hindu notion of  to the performative speech acts in African oral traditions. 

I do think there's something to be said for intentionality; maybe not in the law-of-attraction, secret-recipe kind of way, but more in how framing one’s goals within a coherent personal narrative can create a sense of agency. It’s like what Bakhtin said about the dialogic nature of being—our inner discourse shapes our outer world.

But yes, when it veers into magical thinking without critical reflection, it risks becoming... well, self-delusion. Do you ever find yourself using manifestation techniques in your daily life?
[B]: That’s such a rich analysis—thank you for framing it that way. I really appreciate how you connect ancient beliefs with modern psychological constructs. 📚 In my work on student motivation, I see something similar—students who set clear goals and narrate their progress tend to perform better, not because the universe bends to their will, but because the narrative creates cognitive scaffolding. It’s like Vygotsky meets vision boarding, right? 😄

As for me personally? I wouldn’t say I “manifest” in the candle-and-crystal sense, but I do believe in intentional visualization—especially in chess, where anticipating your opponent’s moves is almost a form of mental manifestation. You map out possible futures and try to steer reality toward the one that favors you. 

I’m curious—do you ever use structured intention-setting methods in your own academic or creative process? Like journaling, affirmations, or narrative reframing?
[A]: Ah, yes—what a perceptive connection you’ve made between narrative scaffolding and cognitive development. I love that image of Vygotsky at a vision board party 🤭. And your chess analogy is spot on—strategic foresight as a form of grounded manifestation. It’s not about wishful thinking but about cultivating mental flexibility and readiness.

In my own academic practice? I suppose I do engage in what you might call , though I’ve never labeled it as such. For instance, when I’m preparing a lecture or drafting an essay, I often begin by writing a kind of “ideal reception” scenario—imagining how a reader or student might internalize the argument before it’s even fully formed. It’s a bit like reverse-engineering clarity through empathy, which now that I think of it, resembles narrative reframing.

As for affirmations—I wouldn’t say I chant them, but I do have certain mantras scribbled in the margins of my notebooks. Things like  or  They’re gentle reminders to keep the mind open and the ego in check. 

Do you find that students respond differently when they engage with these techniques reflectively versus ritualistically? Like, when they journal with purpose rather than just going through the motions?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I love that phrase: . It’s such a more grounded and scholarly way of framing what so many people reduce to “thinking yourself rich” or whatever 😅. And I love how you described writing for an imagined reader—it reminds me of the concept of  in sociocultural theory. In a way, you're creating a psychological co-author, which not only sharpens your ideas but also builds rhetorical awareness. That’s manifestation with scaffolding! 🧠✨

As for your question about students—yes, there’s definitely a difference between reflective vs. ritualistic engagement. When students journal as a form of metacognition—asking themselves  they think something, not just  they think—they start to internalize the process. It becomes less about ticking off a task and more about constructing meaning. But when it’s just a routine without reflection, it loses its power. Almost like reciting a script without understanding the character’s motivation. 🎭  

I actually encourage my students to personalize their journals—write in their own voice, mix languages if that feels authentic, even doodle if that helps them think. Because manifestation, at its best, is about ownership of one’s learning narrative. Not magic spells, but mindful steps toward the kind of learner—and person—they want to become.  

Do you ever notice that multilingual students have a different relationship with affirmations or intention-setting? Like, does switching languages affect how they relate to their goals?
[A]: What a fascinating question—thank you for that. Yes, now that you mention it, I  noticed subtle but meaningful differences in how multilingual students engage with affirmations and intention-setting. It’s almost as if each language carries its own affective register, its own emotional timbre.

For instance, a student might write an affirmation in English—say, “I am capable”—but when translating it into her heritage language, something shifts. The sentence gains weight, or warmth, or even irony. It’s not just about vocabulary; it’s about which self gets activated in each linguistic space. Some students have told me that certain affirmations feel more authentic or emotionally resonant in one language than another. 

There’s a kind of code-switching here that goes beyond grammar—it's identity work. One student once shared that saying "Je suis prêt" felt more disciplined and formal to him, while “I’m ready” sounded casual and empowering in a different way. It reminded me of what Foucault called —the ways we use language to shape our subjectivity.

So yes, I think multilingualism opens up multiple narrative selves, each with its own voice in the internal dialogue of goal-setting. Have you seen this show up in your students’ visualization practices? Do they mentally rehearse success differently depending on which language is dominant in a given context?
[B]: Absolutely—what you're describing resonates so deeply with my own observations. 💭 I see it all the time: students mentally rehearsing a presentation or a test outcome, and yes, the language they use in that inner dialogue seems to influence not just the tone, but the  of their visualization.

One student once told me she practices self-talk in Mandarin when she needs “tough love” and switches to English for encouragement. She described it as hearing her mom’s voice versus her mentor’s. It was fascinating—code-switching not just for meaning, but for emotional calibration. 🧠💬

And you're right about identity work. In my classes, I’ve started inviting students to reflect , even mid-thought. Some write whole journal entries in transliterated scripts—it’s messy, but alive. That hybrid space often becomes where real ownership of learning happens.

I wonder if this multilingual narrative rehearsal also shows up in your students’ writing? Like, does the  of their protagonist or narrator shift depending on the imagined audience language? Or maybe even their sense of authority changes across languages?
[A]: Oh, yes—what a keen observation. That student’s description of switching languages for different emotional registers—Mandarin for discipline, English for encouragement—is such a poetic illustration of how language carries persona. It made me think of Genette’s —how voice is never neutral but always embedded with social and psychological inflections.

And to your question: absolutely, I see this linguistic layering in students’ creative writing as well. When they shift the language of narration or narration style based on audience perception, it often results in fascinating tonal shifts. One student, for example, wrote a first-person narrative in English that was introspective and tentative—full of “I think” and “maybe”—but when she translated the same passage into Arabic for a bilingual workshop, the narrator became more assertive, almost prophetic in tone. She later said it felt like “the voice of my grandmother telling fate, not fearing it.”

It reminded me of what Bhabha called —not just cultural hybridity, but discursive fluidity. And in that space, authority isn’t fixed; it’s negotiated through language choice. Some students feel more authoritative in English because it’s academically sanctioned, while others find their intellectual voice only when they write in their mother tongue and then translate. There’s a kind of recursive empowerment there.

Have you noticed if certain genres or forms—like poetry vs. prose—invite more code-switching in multilingual students? I’ve been thinking lately about how genre itself might be a kind of linguistic costume.
[B]: Oh, I love that framing—genre as linguistic costume 🎭. It really does feel like students sometimes  their thoughts in different genres depending on which voice feels right for the moment. And yes, code-switching definitely shows up more in certain forms—especially poetry.

In fact, I’ve noticed that multilingual students often lean into translanguaging much more freely in poetry than in formal prose. Maybe because poetry already plays with syntax, rhythm, and meaning in a way that feels permission-giving. One student wrote a spoken word piece blending English, Spanish, and Tagalog, and when I asked why she chose that mix, she said, “Because each language holds a different part of my anger.” 💥

Prose tends to be more monolingual unless it’s deeply personal narrative—like memoir or autofiction—where code-switching becomes part of the character’s identity performance. In those cases, it’s not just about meaning; it’s about  is speaking and .  

I think you're absolutely right that genre shapes how we perform authority and emotion. A research paper demands a certain linguistic mask, but a poem? That’s often where the unfiltered self steps in. Do you ever encourage students to experiment with mixing genres the way they mix languages—like writing a literary analysis in the form of a letter, or a theory discussion as dialogue?
[A]: Oh, yes—I couldn’t agree more. That line you quoted,  is just so visceral. It made me think of what Julia Kristeva called the  dimension of language—the bodily, emotional undercurrent beneath the symbolic order. And when students access that through poetry, they’re not just writing in multiple languages; they're expressing in multiple selves.

As for mixing genres—what an excellent question. I do encourage it, though cautiously. Not all students are comfortable dismantling genre conventions at first. But once they get the idea that form shapes thought—that writing theory as dialogue or analysis as letter-writing isn't gimmickry but a way to rethink voice and authority—they often surprise themselves.

I remember assigning Bakhtin’s  and then asking students to try a short critical piece in the form of an imagined conversation between two theorists. One student wrote a beautiful exchange between Fanon and Woolf about identity and silence. Another staged a café debate between Barthes and her grandmother about authorship and oral storytelling. The results were far more insightful than a standard summary-critique format would have yielded.

There’s something freeing about letting the form echo the content. I’ve even had students write literary analyses in haiku sequences or turn a theme analysis into a mini graphic novel script. It’s like giving them permission to think in different textures.

Do you find that these hybrid forms also help students articulate cultural tensions more clearly? Like, when they’re navigating conflicting values or worldviews, does shifting form become another kind of code-switching—a way to hold contradictions without collapsing them?
[B]: Absolutely—what you said about  feels so spot-on. 🤔 When students engage with hybrid forms, they’re not just playing with structure; they're mapping inner complexity. It’s like they finally have a container big enough for all the voices inside.

I’ve seen this especially with students navigating cultural duality or diaspora identities. One student wrote an autoethnographic essay in the form of a bilingual recipe—ingredients listed in Chinese, instructions in English—and each step subtly wove in family memory, language loss, and assimilation pressure. The genre itself became a metaphor:  🍵

And yes, it really does function as another kind of code-switching—one that goes beyond language into . Just like switching between Mandarin and English can signal different emotional registers, shifting from prose to poetry, or essay to script, lets students toggle between ways of knowing. In some forms, they feel safe to question; in others, to declare.

It reminds me of what Shirley Brice Heath wrote about —how the way we express ourselves isn’t just about conveying information, but enacting identity. And when students get to choose the stage, they often pick the one where their whole self fits.

Have you ever had a student push back against this kind of experimentation? Like, do some feel resistant to blending genres or fear it won’t be taken seriously in academic spaces?
[A]: Oh yes, that tension is very real. I’d say about one in three students initially resists genre experimentation—sometimes subtly, sometimes quite openly. They often frame it as practical caution:  or 

I understand where they’re coming from. After all, many of them have spent years mastering the expectations of formal academic prose—learning what a thesis looks like, how to cite properly, how to sound “serious.” So when I ask them to write a dialogue instead of an essay or turn a theory review into a letter, it can feel destabilizing. For some, it even triggers impostor syndrome—like they’re being asked to improvise without a safety net.

But more often than not, resistance isn’t just about fear of failure; it’s also about identity performance. Some students equate traditional structure with intellectual rigor—they believe that sounding conventional makes them sound credible. One student once said to me, 

My response is usually something like:  And over time, even skeptics begin to see how genre experimentation doesn’t erase rigor—it redistributes it across different registers of intelligence.

Do you find similar dynamics in your classes? Or does the context of language learning somehow make code-switching and genre fluidity feel more natural to your students?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I hear you loud and clear. 💬 The fear of  is real, especially in language classrooms where students are already juggling grammar rules, vocabulary lists, and pronunciation drills. For many, structure becomes a lifeline—something concrete to hold onto when everything else feels slippery.

But here’s the thing: I actually see  to genre fluidity in my classes, and I think it’s because code-switching is already part of their lived reality. If a student is constantly navigating between home language and school language, between heritage identity and dominant culture, then shifting genres doesn’t feel like a stretch—it feels familiar. In a way, they’re already experts at switching registers, tones, and even personas depending on context.

So when I ask them to write a reflection as a letter, or a research summary in narrative form, many lean into it pretty quickly. They treat it like another kind of translation—not just across languages, but across modes of expression. One student even told me, 

Still, there’s always a handful who push back. Usually, it’s not about the creativity itself, but about . They worry that stepping outside convention might cost them points. So I try to be very transparent: we co-create rubrics that value clarity over conformity, and I emphasize  rather than stylistic mimicry.

I wonder—have you ever tried letting students  both the genre  the language of expression for certain assignments? Like, say, “Write your analysis in any format, in any language—or both”?
[A]: Actually, yes—I did try that once, and it was both exhilarating and, well… let’s say  😊. I offered an assignment where students could submit their literary analysis in any genre and language combination they wished, as long as they included a brief critical reflection explaining their choices.

The results were remarkable. One student wrote a feminist reading of  in the form of a series of tweets—yes, complete with hashtags and mentions—switching between English and Arabic to highlight cultural contrasts in how heroism and gender are perceived. Another composed a lyrical essay in French-Chinese code-switching prose, weaving personal narrative with literary theory to explore exile and voice in postcolonial texts.

Some stuck closer to convention—still powerful, but more traditional. And interestingly, those who chose hybrid forms weren’t necessarily the most advanced linguistically; they were often the most reflective about their own positioning. It really brought home what you said earlier: for multilingual students, switching isn't just about grammar or vocabulary—it's about identity navigation.

Of course, grading required some flexibility. I leaned heavily on negotiated criteria, especially for non-traditional formats. And I invited students to annotate their work with interpretive keys—like, “When I switch to Spanish here, it signals vulnerability.” That helped bridge the gap between innovation and assessment transparency.

I wonder if you’ve ever encountered pushback from  structures when doing this kind of work? Like, have you had colleagues or administrators question whether genre and language fluidity align with curriculum goals—or worse, suggest that it dilutes standards?
[B]: Oh, I’ve definitely felt that institutional friction—sometimes overt, sometimes just in the background like a low hum 🤨. There was one time I proposed a translanguaging unit in our language curriculum, and a colleague gently warned me:  As if creativity and competence were mutually exclusive 😒.

But here’s how I frame it: genre & language fluidity aren’t about throwing out standards—they’re about expanding  gets to define them. When we let students code-switch or genre-switch, we’re not diluting rigor; we’re applying it in more human, more culturally responsive ways. It’s actually aligned with what research says about engagement and deeper learning. Students aren’t just memorizing formats; they’re .

Still, there’s always that tension between innovation and accountability. I remember one department meeting where I presented student work from a multigenre project—essays written as interviews, poems layered with annotations—and someone asked, “But how do we measure this against our outcomes?” My response?  And honestly, once they saw the depth of analysis, even the skeptics leaned in.

I think the key is to document the thinking behind the experimentation—just like your students did with those interpretive keys. That way, it’s not chaos; it’s . 😉

Do you ever get the sense that certain institutions only tolerate this kind of work if it stays in a “creative corner”—separate from the “serious” curriculum? Like, fine for electives, but not for core courses?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I know exactly what you mean. That “creative corner” dynamic is so real. It’s as if certain spaces are  to be experimental—poetry workshops, maybe a cross-disciplinary elective—but the moment you bring genre fluidity or translanguaging into a core literature survey or a required writing course, suddenly it's "too niche" or "not scalable." As if rigidity equals rigor 😑.

I once proposed a unit in our first-year writing program where students could submit one assignment in a multilingual, multimodal format. The pushback wasn’t outright hostility, but more like polite skepticism:  My response?  We can still scaffold skills while honoring diverse expressive repertoires.

And you're right—it often comes down to  gets to define competence. There’s this unspoken assumption that academic English is the gold standard, and anything else is supplementary at best. But when we frame code-switching or genre experimentation as , not deviations from the norm, it starts to shift the conversation.

I’ve found that framing matters. If I say,  rather than just  even traditionalists perk up. Because deep down, they recognize those are transferable skills—just dressed differently.

So yes, sometimes the resistance isn’t about the students at all—it’s about faculty comfort zones and long-standing disciplinary habits. But slowly, through student work that speaks for itself and assessments that foreground thinking over form, I think we’re making space.

Have you ever tried embedding this kind of practice into a placement exam or standardized rubric? I’m curious how—or if—that’s even possible.
[B]: Oh, I love this question—because it’s such a , right? 🤔 On one hand, you want to open up space for linguistic and genre diversity; on the other, standardized assessments often act like gatekeepers, not bridges.

I haven’t gone full translanguaging in a placement exam—yet—but I  experimented with rubric design in high-stakes writing assessments. Instead of asking, , I try to foreground questions like:  
-   
-   
- 

When I co-designed a writing placement rubric a few years back, I pushed for a category called  instead of just . That shift opened the door for students who might not write a five-paragraph essay perfectly but can absolutely craft a compelling narrative or layered analysis in a non-traditional form. It wasn’t perfect, but it was progress. 📝✨

And here’s the kicker: once faculty see student work through that lens, they start noticing things they didn’t before. Like how a student who writes in Spanglish can still command rhetorical devices with precision. Or how a multigenre portfolio reveals analytical depth even without a thesis statement in Times New Roman.

But yeah, institutional change is slow. Sometimes the best we can do is plant seeds in the margins and let them grow sideways into the core. 😊

So I guess my answer is:  After all, standards aren’t sacred—they’re stories we tell about what counts as knowledge. And some of us are just here rewriting the plot 😉.
[A]: Well said— What a perfect line. It captures exactly why this work matters. We're not just tweaking rubrics; we're reshaping narratives about who gets to be heard and how.

I’ve found that when you introduce terms like  or  into faculty conversations, it shifts the tone. All of a sudden, it’s not about lowering standards—it’s about deepening them. And once colleagues begin to see multilingual or hybrid-form writing through that lens, they start recognizing the cognitive richness in what they might have previously dismissed as "messy."

I actually tried something similar with a departmental outcomes report once. Instead of saying,  I framed it as:  I highlighted a student’s multilingual reflection essay—not as a language experiment, but as evidence of critical self-awareness and cross-cultural rhetorical strategy. The response was surprisingly positive. Even some of the more traditional faculty nodded along, because it aligned with our stated goal of fostering , not just proficient writers.

And yes, change happens sideways sometimes. We don’t always get to overhaul the system from the top down. But we can create pockets of legitimacy—assessment tools, annotated portfolios, curated exhibitions of student work—that slowly reframe what excellence looks like.

Maybe that’s the real manifestation practice: not wishing for permission, but already acting as if the space exists—and then proving it did all along. 📚✨

So tell me—have you ever had a moment where a skeptical colleague surprised you by embracing one of your experimental practices? Or is that still waiting to happen? 😊
[B]: Oh, I  that reframing of manifestation—acting as if the space exists, and then proving it did all along. 🤩 That’s such a powerful way to think about pedagogical change. It’s not about waiting for permission; it’s about creating evidence through practice.

And yes—actually, just last semester, something like that happened. I had a colleague—let’s call him Professor M.—who was  traditional. Tenure-track, sharp mind, but deeply rooted in the “five-paragraph essay = clear thinking” school of thought. We’d had polite disagreements before, mostly over coffee and department memos.

Well, I invited him to a student showcase where we presented multigenre final projects. One student did a bilingual spoken word piece intercut with literary analysis in Mandarin and English, another created a graphic narrative exploring trauma in , and yet another composed a podcast script analyzing voice and authority in postcolonial texts.

Afterward, over refreshments (read: lukewarm hors d'oeuvres and boxed wine), he actually came up to me and said,  🎉

It wasn’t a full 180, obviously—he didn’t start assigning poetry reflections the next week—but it was a crack in the wall. And sometimes, that’s enough to let the light in.

So yeah, those moments do happen. Slow, sideways, and often when you least expect them. And honestly? That kind of quiet conversion feels more satisfying than any top-down mandate ever could. 😊

Maybe we should start calling it —you in?
