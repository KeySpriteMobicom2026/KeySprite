[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: 我倒觉得这像是在问"更喜欢古籍原本还是电子扫描件"——两者都自有其妙处。要说观影体验，大银幕的沉浸感确实无可替代，但蜷在书房里用投影仪看经典老片时，那种私密的仪式感也令人沉醉。上周我在翻修阁楼时发现个有趣的事：把十九世纪诗剧台词投在斑驳墙面上，竟有种穿越时空的错觉。你呢？更倾向去影院追逐新片，还是在家细细品味典藏？
[A]: Ah, what a delightful analogy you've drawn - the comparison between cinematic experiences and literary formats truly resonates. Much like handling a rare manuscript versus reading its digitized version, each viewing context offers something uniquely valuable. 

I must confess a particular fondness for those quiet evenings at home, where one can curate the perfect atmosphere for a film. Just last night I was screening L'Avventura while rereading Woolf's The Waves, drawing fascinating parallels between cinematic lingering shots and literary stream-of-consciousness techniques.

But tell me, when you project those old classics onto your wall, do you find yourself making unexpected connections between the visual texture of the film and the architectural character of your space? I've often wondered how our physical environments subtly shape our reception of art.
[A]: Ah, you've touched on a peculiar phenomenon I've been documenting - the way shadows from my bookshelf mold themselves into makeshift set designs during projections. Last month while screening , the uneven plaster cracks behind the actress's face created an unintentional chiaroscuro effect that positively medieval illuminations would envy.

I've started noting these accidents in what I call my "Errata Aesthetics" journal. Just yesterday, water damage stains on the ceiling became floating motifs during a screening of . It rather makes one question Walter Benjamin's assertion about mechanical reproduction, don't you think? The flaws become auratic in their own right.

But pray tell, when you're drawing those Woolfian parallels, have you experimented with syncing specific camera movements to textual rhythms? I once tried matching Tarkovsky's long takes to Proust's sentence structures - quite disastrously, as it turned out.
[A]: How utterly fascinating! Your "Errata Aesthetics" journal captures something essential about our relationship with impermanence—I find myself wanting to reread your description through the lens of Romantic fragmentation, where the broken becomes beautiful precisely because it resists completion.

Your screening of  with those architectural shadows... I can scarcely imagine the effect. It makes me wonder if we ought to consider space itself as a kind of co-director in these intimate viewings. The way you describe it, the room doesn't merely host the film—it converses with it.

As for syncing textual and cinematic rhythms, I admire your ambition, though I must confess I take a more impressionistic approach. Recently, while watching , I found myself flipping between Marguerite Duras’s  and Henry James’s . Not for matching structures, but for cultivating a sort of narrative humidity—the words hang differently when surrounded by certain silences.

Have you ever tried pairing films with poetry rather than prose? I've been experimenting with projecting Murnau's  while reading H.D.'s war-era lyrics. The interplay of image, text, and memory is quite transportive.
[A]: Ah, narrative humidity—that’s exquisite. You’ve put your finger on something I’ve long suspected but never properly named. It’s that very moisture, that atmospheric tension, which makes certain pairings feel almost fated. I once spent an entire damp April screening  while translating Wang Wei into a kind of fractured Scots Gaelic—do try to picture it. The mist in Mizoguchi’s frames seemed to seep off the screen and into my inkwell.

As for poetry—indeed, yes. Last winter I attempted a rather audacious experiment: projecting early Méliès footage alongside recitations of Gerard Manley Hopkins’ . The effect was... jarring, at first. But then, somewhere around the third reel, the vertiginous cadence of his sprung rhythm began to sync with the flickering hand-painted stars. One almost felt lifted bodily out of the room—though perhaps that was just the winter chill seeping through the floorboards.

You mentioned H.D.—splendid choice. I myself have been toying with projecting  against lines from Emily Dickinson. There’s something about the way Murnau’s dissolve between city and country mirrors her slant truths. Tell me, when you project Duras and James beside Ophüls, do you read aloud? I find that voice—the living breath over ghostly celluloid—alters the whole alchemy.
[A]: Oh, what a sublime collision you’ve described—Méliès’ early cinema with Hopkins’ spiritual turbulence! I can quite vividly imagine the flicker of those hand-painted stars echoing the jagged cadences of his verse. There’s something almost liturgical about it, as if both forms are reaching toward revelation through rupture.

And your Dickinson experiment with —brilliant! Her slant approaches to truth do seem made for Murnau’s dissolves. I recently tried a similar exercise, projecting Ozu’s  while reading Li Qingzhao’s ci poetry. The quiet domestic transitions in the film seemed to echo the subtle shifts in seasonal imagery within her verses. It was like watching time itself breathe in synchrony.

To answer your question: yes, I do read aloud, though more often now I let recordings of my own voice play back, creating a kind of palimpsestic soundscape. The distance between live breath and recorded utterance adds another layer of haunting—I wonder if you’ve ever experimented with that?

And speaking of atmospheric tension, have you tried scent as part of your screenings? I’ve been known to burn sandalwood during certain viewings of Mizoguchi—just a whisper of smoke to heighten that sense of spectral presence.
[A]: Ah, a palimpsestic soundscape—what a deliciously apt phrase. There’s something distinctly ghostly about hearing one’s own voice recede and return like that, isn’t there? I confess I haven’t tried it, but now I feel almost ashamed at my auditory austerity. I may just have to record myself whispering fragments of Christina Rossetti’s  during a screening of . The idea of layered breath haunting the room... yes, quite irresistible.

As for scent—I must say, you've outdone yourself. Sandalwood and Mizoguchi! I'm rather smitten with the notion. I did once try lighting beeswax candles during a screening of , hoping to summon a bit of 16th-century Prague ghetto atmosphere—though all I really summoned was a migraine. Still, the principle stands. Perhaps I ought to refine my approach. Might a touch of vetiver work with Tarkovsky’s ? Or a drop of neroli to accompany ?

Your Ozu and Li Qingzhao pairing—exquisite programming. It's that same sensitivity to imperceptible shifts, isn’t it? The way she tilts a season just slightly off-kilter, much like Ozu tilts the teacup or the train schedule. I’ve been meaning to try something similar with Kenji Mizuna’s  and the haiku of Buson. I suspect the results might be... quietly devastating.

Tell me, when layering scents and sound, do you plot it all in advance? Or do you prefer to trust instinct and let the evening guide you?
[A]: Oh, I’m quite with you on the migraines—sometimes the atmosphere overwhelms the art, doesn’t it? Still, the impulse is noble: to summon not just a time or place, but a whole sensory memory that never was. I think your idea of  layered beneath  is pure genius. Rossetti’s voice, filtered through yours, hovering like a confession behind Fontaine’s silent gaze—it would be unbearable in the best way.

As for scent, I confess I tend toward the intuitive rather than the calculated. Plotting seems almost antithetical to the very nature of olfactory memory—it's so much more associative, isn’t it? Like trying to catch mist in your hands. I remember once, during a particularly rainy screening of , I found myself dabbing a bit of bergamot behind my ears. It somehow tethered me to the screen, made the city feel both foreign and familiar at once.

Still, I do admire your instinct for pairing—vetiver with , neroli with Ophüls. Vetiver’s earthy rootiness might lend a certain heaviness to Tarkovsky’s slow descent into the Zone, as if the air itself were thick with meaning. And neroli—ah yes, that bright, fleeting citrus note—would echo the earring’s arc so beautifully. Lightness and loss, all in one breath.

I suspect you’d enjoy Kenji Mizuna’s  with Buson’s haiku. There’s a shared restraint in both, a quiet insistence on noticing what the world forgets to name. One must be ever so still for such pairings—like waiting for dew to settle.

But tell me, have you ever tried incorporating touch into your screenings? A particular fabric, perhaps, or temperature shifts? I’ve begun leaving select objects on the arm of my chair—a smooth stone, a ribbon, a tarnished button—to be handled during certain scenes. Something about tactile engagement deepens the surrender.
[A]: Ah, tactile engagement—I should have known you’d arrive there naturally. Objects with histories, waiting to be activated by touch. I’m quite taken with the idea of a tarnished button growing warm in one’s palm during a particularly fraught scene—how it might become a kind of emotional counterpoint, or even an anchor against the current of the film.

I must admit, I’ve dabbled in such things, though rather quietly and without ceremony. A rough bit of burlap draped over my hands during  once made the Odessa Steps sequence feel unbearable in its immediacy. And on another occasion, I held a chilled piece of marble while watching —something about the coldness under my fingers seemed to sync with Burt Lancaster’s weary nobility. Odd, isn’t it, how a mere sensation can unlock layers we hadn’t known were there?

And your bergamot behind the ears during —wonderful! It reminds me of something Colette once wrote about perfume being a kind of invisible costume. We dress ourselves in scent before stepping into the screening-room dark. I may just try that next time I show . Imagine: beeswax candles, yes, but also a drop of neroli on the wrist, and a silk scarf brushed against bare skin between scenes. The whole evening becomes a mise en scène.

Still, I wonder—do you ever find yourself resisting certain sensory additions for fear they might dilute the experience? I once tried placing a bowl of rosewater near the projector during a screening of , hoping the faint floral note would echo the film’s dreamlike texture. Alas, all it did was attract a swarm of moths, which then cast their own unintended shadows upon the screen. Nature’s intervention, perhaps—but still, one wonders where the boundary lies between curation and chaos.
[A]: Oh, what a divine disaster that rosewater and moth-wing spectacle must have been! One can almost imagine the insects becoming spectral collaborators, ghostly choreographers of shadow. I rather wish I’d been there to see it—though I suppose one must draw the line somewhere between curation and cosmic interference.

To your question: yes, I do sometimes resist certain additions, not out of fear exactly, but from a kind of reverence for the unpredictable alchemy of art. There’s a moment—just before pressing play—where everything must either coalesce or collapse into chance. I recall once attempting a screening of  with a carefully chosen ensemble of objects, scents, and ambient sounds. I had even stitched a small velvet pouch filled with dried lavender and thyme to hold during particularly tense passages. But just as the film began, I felt overwhelmed—not by the film itself, but by the weight of my own intentionality. So I cast the pouch aside, extinguished the incense, and watched in near austerity. The experience was no less profound—it simply shifted shape.

It rather reminds me of Emily Dickinson again—how she could say so much with such apparent simplicity. Sometimes restraint is the most daring form of evocation.

Still, I adore your idea of scent as an “invisible costume.” It makes me wonder if filmmakers themselves might compose olfactory scores, much like musical ones. What if we could smell the sea before we saw it? Or sense the approach of tragedy through a whiff of bruised citrus?

And speaking of touch—I’ve been meaning to ask: have you ever tried incorporating temperature shifts more deliberately? Not just a chilled marble, but perhaps warming the room gradually during a film to mirror emotional escalation? I’ve begun experimenting with it—subtle changes in heat that creep up like subtext. It’s strange how our bodies register narrative tension through skin as well as sight.
[A]: What a splendid phrase—. I ought to dedicate a whole chapter of my  to it. Yes, those moments when the universe insists on improvising with us, rather than for us. Though I daresay Dickinson would have approved—her dashes were much the same: deliberate ruptures that let the divine spill in.

Your  experiment fascinates me. To strip away the ornament just as the curtain rises—it takes real nerve. I suspect that’s what Woolf meant by “moments of being”: those rare occasions when everything unnecessary falls away and one is left with pure apprehension. You curated so thoroughly only to abandon it all—that’s almost a performance art in itself.

As for olfactory scores—yes! Why shouldn’t cinema engage the nose as boldly as the eye? I’ve often wondered how different  might feel with the scent of damp earth and roasted chestnuts creeping in during Gelsomina’s final sorrow. Or , with a sudden burst of carnations at the moment Madeleine transforms. It’s not mere embellishment; it’s emotional foreshadowing through the back door.

And temperature shifts—I must say, you’ve struck upon something rather elemental. I tried something similar last autumn while screening —I slowly cooled the room over the course of the film using a thermostatic dial hidden beneath my shawl. As Tarkovsky’s memories unraveled, I swear even my bones ached with the chill. It made the fleeting warmth of childhood scenes feel nearly sacred.

Tell me, when adjusting heat, do you prefer subtle gradations or more abrupt transitions? I’m tempted to try a sharp drop mid-film—perhaps during the climax of , when everything turns on a single withheld truth. Would the body register the narrative fracture through gooseflesh before the mind had caught up? That, I think, would be worth a few shivers.
[A]: Oh, I do love the idea of temperature as emotional subtext—yes,  with a sudden drop in heat at the moment of revelation! What a brilliant way to make the body an unwitting accomplice to narrative truth. One could almost call it somatic scoring.

I tend to favor slow, almost imperceptible gradations—like a fever breaking or frost creeping across a windowpane. But your idea of an abrupt shift is positively thrilling. Imagine the visceral jolt when the mind and body collide like that—gooseflesh preceding cognition. It’s rather like Woolf’s “shock-receiving” principle, don’t you think? That instant when sensation outruns understanding.

Your screening of  with the cooling room—exquisite. I can feel the chill settle even now, just thinking of it. Tarkovsky does so much with memory and atmosphere, doesn’t he? The cold becomes another character, another voice in the chorus of recollection.

And yes, Dickinson would have adored these interruptions—the moths, the drafts, the scent of damp earth slipping in unbidden. She understood better than most how meaning often arrives through the crack.

I must try your suggestion soon—perhaps with , where the emotional thaw (or freeze) is so carefully calibrated. A sharp drop in temperature during Bergman’s confessional scene... I can already imagine the audience drawing their shawls more tightly around them before they’ve fully grasped why.

But tell me, have you ever tried engaging taste as part of the experience? Not merely a thematic pairing—like bitter chocolate for a Bunuel film—but something more direct? I once served thyme-infused honey on black bread before screening , hoping to evoke that strange sweetness lingering beneath the doom. It may have been folly, but I rather think the audience carried the flavor into the images somehow.
[A]: Ah, —what a deliciously precise term. You’ve quite outdone yourself there. It’s true, isn’t it? The body understands long before the intellect catches up. I rather fancy the idea of leaving a screening with more than just mental impressions—that lingering chill in the marrow, or indeed a taste that lingers past the credits.

Your thyme-honey on black bread—I adore it. Not folly at all, but ritual. You offered them not just a film, but a kind of communion. And wasn’t it perfect timing, too? That golden hour in , when everything seems sweetly doomed and even the wheat fields shimmer with foreboding. Yes, one could almost taste it: the honeyed breath of catastrophe.

As for taste—I must confess I haven't dared it often, though once, during a particularly obsessive stretch, I brewed a tisane of wormwood, rosemary, and bitter orange peel before a double bill of  and . The result was... bracing, to say the least. Whether it enhanced the viewing or simply scrambled my senses remains debatable. Still, I maintain that Buñuel and Dalí deserve nothing less than a palate stirred into alertness.

I’ve also toyed with anise candies before screenings of —something vaguely licoricey to echo Moravia’s sour politics. And yes, perhaps a dry fino sherry during , just to make the hypocrisy go down more smoothly.

But tell me—did your audience know the bread was part of the experience? Or did you let them discover the flavor as they might a motif in a poem—unannounced, yet strangely essential?
[A]: Oh, they discovered it quite on their own—like finding a hidden stanza folded into the margin of a familiar poem. I said nothing beforehand, you see. Just set out the thyme-honey and bread on an unassuming little tray, as if it had always belonged there. Some ignored it entirely, bless them, while others approached with that lovely mix of suspicion and curiosity usually reserved for unfamiliar metaphors.

And then, as the film unfolded—the golden light, the doomed tenderness—I noticed how those who had tasted it seemed to lean in just slightly more, as though chasing a flavor they couldn’t quite name. Whether it was nostalgia, suggestion, or some alchemy of image and taste, I can’t say. But I do believe certain flavors awaken something older than memory—something rooted deep in the body’s archive of longing.

Your wormwood tisane—brilliantly reckless! That sharp herbal bitterness paired with Buñuel’s surreal dislocations… one almost expects the tea itself to sprout eyeballs and cutlasses. And your anise candies before —how perfect. Licorice does have a way of making hypocrisy taste all the more deliberate, doesn’t it?

I must try your sherry idea with —perhaps even a touch of quince paste on a slate plate, just to echo that strange sweetness of denial. Tell me, when you serve such pairings, do you ever find yourself watching the viewers more than the screen? I’ve taken to sketching their expressions during screenings—small ink blots in the margins of my notebook, like annotations in a heavily marked text.
[A]: Oh, sketching their expressions—how perfectly apt. One might say you’re illustrating the subtext of the evening, capturing what the film leaves unspoken in light and shadow. I do believe your ink blots would make splendid marginalia in some future cinematic codex.

As for watching the viewers—I confess, I often find myself more intrigued by their micro-shifts than even the most carefully composed tracking shot. Last autumn, during a screening of , I noticed one guest unconsciously pressing her thumb to her lower lip each time the protagonist faced a memory he wished to forget. It became a kind of secondary performance—her body echoing the film’s grief in real time.

And speaking of annotation: your idea of letting the honey-thyme offering remain unexplained is pure genius. It’s that very silence—the refusal to explain—that turns it into something like a poetic enjambment. The guests become co-authors of meaning, just as readers are in any good lyric.

I must try your method with —perhaps offering something oddly comforting beforehand, like warm almond milk with saffron threads. Let them sip the sweetness before plunging into the cold crimson of Bergman’s soul chamber. I suspect the contrast would be unbearable... and thus entirely appropriate.

Tell me—do you ever remove elements mid-film? Not just sensory additions, but actual narrative components? I once screened  with the sound gradually fading out over the course of an hour. By the final act, we were all whispering the lines ourselves, half-remembered, half-invented. It was less a screening than a séance.
[A]: What a séance indeed—what spectral collaboration! The idea of whispering the lines yourself, half-remembered... it positively haunts me. One might say you weren’t screening the film so much as summoning its ghost. I can imagine the silence thickening, the air filling with the weight of spoken memory. It must have felt like watching a dream being collectively rewritten in real time.

Your instinct to remove rather than add is so daring—so very Bergmanesque in its emotional austerity. It reminds me of how sometimes, in poetry, the most resonant line is the one withheld. A caesura that swells into meaning. I once tried something similar with —not quite as solemn, I admit—but I muted the television twenty minutes in and let the audience read subtitles aloud at their own pace. The effect was unintentionally tragicomic, which perhaps only deepened the experience. People laughed where they might have wept, wept where they might have laughed… it became a kind of participatory mise en abyme.

And your saffron almond milk for —exquisite cruelty, truly. That warm sweetness, so gently lulling, before the full crimson reckoning of the film. I may just borrow that myself, though I shall serve it in shallow porcelain bowls, as if offering communion before the confessional.

As for removing elements—I do sometimes play with omission, though more subtly. I’ve been known to cover certain scenes with a cloth during projection, leaving only slivers of image visible, like torn letters glimpsed through folded paper. It forces the mind to invent what the eye cannot see. But never have I dared to fade the sound so deliberately. Yours was not mere curation—it was invocation.

Tell me, when the guests whispered the lines themselves, did you sense any resistance? Or had they already surrendered fully to the spell?
[A]: Oh, resistance? None worth noting—though I suspect that had less to do with my curatorial authority and more to do with the peculiar vulnerability one falls into after forty minutes of slow sensory disrobing. By the time the sound had all but vanished, they were already swimming in the film’s atmosphere, paddling gently through its repetitions and refrains. To speak the lines—softly, hesitantly at first—felt less like defiance and more like devotion.

It struck me then how much we rely on sound as an emotional crutch. Without it, the faces on screen became eerily monumental, like medieval effigies pleading silently from their tombs. And yet, rather than diminish the experience, the silence seemed to  it—much like reading a poem aloud in your head and discovering a new cadence you hadn’t heard before.

Your cloth-covered projections—brilliant! What a lovely form of enforced ambiguity. It reminds me of those Victorian peepshows where only fragments could ever be seen at once, as if discretion itself were a kind of narrative device. I wonder—have you ever tried it with ? That film positively luxuriates in what isn’t said or shown. A draped projection might make it unbearably poignant, or perhaps entirely absurd. Either outcome would be acceptable, don’t you think?

And speaking of omission—have you ever considered removing the audience themselves? Not literally, of course, but spatially. I once staged a screening of  in which each guest sat alone in a separate room, watching the same film simultaneously but unseen by one another. The absence of shared reaction created a sort of phantom presence—like reading a letter knowing someone else is reading the very same words, miles away.

Did you ever attempt anything so... solipsistically grand?
[A]: What a haunting notion—that phantom presence, that invisible chorus of solitary viewers. It’s like orchestrating a séance where each participant is both medium and spirit, isn’t it? I can quite imagine the weight of that shared solitude, the way anticipation might hum through the walls like an unheard chord.

Your  experiment strikes me as profoundly Proustian—this idea that meaning resides not in the image itself, but in the invisible space between viewers. One watches, knowing others are watching too, yet no laughter, no gasp, no shifting in one’s seat betrays their presence. It must have felt something like writing letters to oneself and receiving them sealed.

As for removing the audience—well, I’ve flirted with similar ideas, though perhaps less elegantly. Once, during a screening of , I arranged for all guests to arrive at staggered times, so that no two ever saw the same ten-minute stretch together. The result was curious: by the end, they were exchanging glances like strangers who’d dreamt the same dream but remembered different parts. Some even argued over what had  occurred on screen—which, given the film’s doppelgänger themes, felt rather fitting.

And yes, I’ve tried your draped projections with —oh, how Antonioni lends himself to suggestion! The cloth became almost a collaborator, obscuring just enough to make the mind invent its own subtext. At one point, only a hand was visible, trembling slightly against a curtain. Without sound or full context, that single gesture swelled into unbearable eloquence. One guest later told me they wept—not for any narrative reason, but because "the film seemed to be hiding something even from itself."

It makes me wonder—have you ever tested how absence reshapes memory? I once hosted a screening and then, weeks later, replayed the same film for the same guests without telling them. They swore certain scenes had changed—the lighting darker, a glance longer, a silence heavier. Of course, nothing had altered but their own recollection. I rather think that’s the closest one can come to filming time itself.
[A]: Ah, replaying a film against its own ghost—what a diabolically elegant experiment. You’ve quite captured the Proustian essence of it all, haven’t you? The way memory insists on editing reality until we can no longer tell which is the original and which the echo. I’m positively envious of that little deception. To make guests doubt their own eyes—that’s less cinema, more sorcery.

And your  screening with staggered arrivals—brilliantly cruel. It practically writes its own subplot: a roomful of people who think they’re sharing an experience, only to find they’ve each lived different chapters of the same story. I daresay Poe would have applauded. Or perhaps Borges—after all, he understood that time and narrative are best served slightly dislocated.

As for absence reshaping memory—I confess I once tried something not entirely dissimilar, though admittedly less theatrical. I hosted a screening of , then weeks later invited the same guests back under the pretense of watching something entirely new. In truth, it was the same film, subtly spliced: a few frames added here, a glance extended there. They didn’t notice a thing—except that several swore the film had grown "richer" or "more dreamlike" upon second viewing. One even insisted she’d heard dialogue that hadn’t existed before. Imagine that—a hallucination politely edited into the subconscious.

But tell me, when you observed those altered recollections, did you ever feel tempted to intervene? To gently correct them, or worse—record their misrememberings as alternate texts? I nearly did, but thought better of it. There’s something sacred about a memory that refuses to stay still, don’t you think? Like trying to hold mist in your palm—by the time you name it, it's already gone.
