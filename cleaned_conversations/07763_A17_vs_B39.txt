[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. Lately, I've found myself quite fascinated by the mystery surrounding the Voynich manuscript. It's a 15th-century book filled with strange illustrations and text written in an unknown language or cipher. Despite numerous attempts by cryptographers and linguists over the past century, no one has definitively deciphered its contents. Makes you wonder what secrets it might hold—scientific knowledge? An elaborate hoax? Or perhaps something even more peculiar. What about you? Any unsolved mysteries piquing your curiosity?
[A]: Oh, absolutely! The Voynich manuscript is a most tantalizing enigma—it’s like a literary sphinx, daring us to uncover its riddle. I must admit, though, my attention has been drawn recently to the case of the “Somerton Man.” Discovered in 1948 on a beach in Adelaide, Australia, the man was well-dressed, physically fit, and died under mysterious circumstances. A scrap of paper with the phrase —meaning “finished” or “ended” in Persian—was found sewn into his coat lining, leading to all sorts of theories involving espionage, secret codes, and even forbidden love. 

What fascinates me most is how such mysteries straddle the line between fact and fiction; they feel like plots from a novel, yet they are rooted in real history. Have you ever read Umberto Eco’s ? It plays with the idea of turning unsolved mysteries into elaborate conspiracies—perhaps not too far from what might be going on with the Voynich manuscript itself. Do you think it could be a forgotten proto-scientific treatise, or perhaps... a hoax with more layers than we realize?
[B]: Ah, the Somerton Man—I’d almost forgotten about that case. You’re absolutely right; it reads like a noir detective novel with a touch of the metaphysical. The  clue is particularly haunting. Makes you wonder if he was fleeing something—or someone.

As for , yes, I remember spending a rainy week in my study devouring that one, surrounded by half-empty cups of tea and scribbled notes. Eco brilliantly captures how the human mind seeks patterns, even where none may exist. It does make me question the Voynich manuscript’s origins more deeply: Is it a cipher for lost knowledge, or merely an elaborate game played centuries ago? Either way, both scenarios speak to our enduring love affair with mystery.

I’ve always leaned toward the idea that the manuscript might be a 15th-century alchemical treatise—perhaps compiled by someone brilliant but misunderstood in their time. But then again, maybe it’s just a very clever hoax. Sometimes history keeps its best jokes hidden in plain sight. Do you lean toward any particular theory?
[A]: Ah, I do love how you put that—“history keeps its best jokes hidden in plain sight.” That feels rather true, doesn’t it? I must say, I’ve toyed with the alchemical treatise theory myself; there’s something so poetic about the idea of a forgotten polymath encoding esoteric knowledge in a script we still can’t crack. But then again, the hoax hypothesis is equally seductive in its own way—it's almost  amusing if it turns out to be an elaborate prank played on posterity.

I’ve also wondered whether the manuscript might contain encoded botanical or medical knowledge from a culture or sect that didn’t leave a broader written record. Some of the plant illustrations seem...  familiar, as though they hover just at the edge of recognition. It reminds me a bit of reading Emily Dickinson—so close to meaning, yet always slipping through your fingers.

And speaking of slipping through fingers, have you come across the mystery of the ? There’s something quietly haunting about objects that seem to belong to no known place or time. Do these kinds of historical riddles ever make you feel like you're standing at the threshold of another world entirely?
[B]: That notion of standing at the threshold of another world—yes, that’s precisely the sensation these mysteries evoke. Like opening a door marked "Do Not Disturb" and finding the room rearranged by unseen hands.

The Marblehead Seal is a curious one. A symbol carved on stone, discovered in Massachusetts, yet seemingly disconnected from any known local tradition. It feels like a signature left behind by someone trying to say, , but without telling us who  were. There’s an eerie beauty in that silence.

As for the Voynich manuscript’s botanical illustrations—you're right, they do hover just at the edge of recognition. I once spent an afternoon comparing some of them with medieval herbals, and yes, there are similarities, but skewed, almost as if drawn from memory or through a glass darkly. Some look like plants you’d find in the Mediterranean, others... not so much. Makes you wonder whether the illustrator had access to now-lost specimens, or perhaps was working entirely from imagination—or instruction.

And that brings me back to the idea of encoded knowledge. If it  a cipher, what might we stand to gain from breaking it? A forgotten cure? A philosophical treatise? Or worse, a 15th-century horoscope column?

Tell me—have you ever tried your hand at deciphering anything like this? Sketching theories in the margins of notebooks late at night?
[A]: Oh, how could one resist? I must confess, I’ve had my own late-night adventures with ciphers and obscure manuscripts—though I suspect my efforts are more amateur sleuthing than scholarly rigor. There’s something irresistibly romantic about the idea of decoding a forgotten message, as if you’re communing across centuries with a mind that anticipated your curiosity.

I once tried applying basic frequency analysis to a few pages of the Voynich text, just for fun, convinced I might spot a pattern where no one else had. Spoiler: I didn’t. But in the process, I found myself imagining the scribe hunched over vellum by candlelight, perhaps smirking at the thought of future readers baffled by their handiwork.

And yes, the idea of what we might uncover is thrilling. A lost pharmacopoeia? A secret sect’s doctrine? Or—dare I say—a proto-scientific treatise on astronomy or anatomy centuries ahead of its time? Even the possibility of nonsense feels meaningful. After all, literature is full of texts that baffled contemporaries but later became canonical—perhaps the Voynich manuscript is simply waiting for the right reader, the right century.

Speaking of which, have you ever read ? That labyrinthine Gothic tale by Potocki? It shares a similar spirit—stories within stories, clues that lead nowhere, and yet one cannot stop reading. Do you think there's value in preserving the mystery, or must every cipher be cracked to be valuable?
[B]: Ah, —now there’s a novel that lingers like fog over a graveyard. Yes, I’ve read it more than once, and each time I’m struck by how it plays with narrative layers the way the Voynich manuscript toys with language. Both feel like mazes where every turn seems meaningful, even if you never reach the center.

You ask whether there's value in preserving the mystery—and I think there is. Some puzzles might be more valuable unsolved. Not all doors are meant to be opened; some are there simply to remind us that wonder still exists in the world. The Mona Lisa’s smile, the Fermi Paradox, the silence of the Marblehead Seal—these things resonate partly because they resist explanation.

Take the Voynich manuscript: if we ever did crack its code, what if it turned out to be mundane? A list of medicinal recipes? A monk’s dream journal? Or worse—bad poetry? Sometimes the legend surpasses the truth. That said, I’d still be first in line for the decryption seminar. Curiosity is a stubborn thing.

Do I think every cipher must be cracked? No. But I do think every cipher deserves to be studied—like an ancient tree whose rings tell a story we may never fully read, but can still admire.
[A]: How beautifully put— There’s such grace in that metaphor. It reminds me of reading Gerard Manley Hopkins in springtime—full of wonder, a little melancholy, and always the sense that meaning unfolds in its own time, if at all.

I think you’re right: not every mystery needs solving, but each deserves our attention, our reverence even. The act of searching itself becomes a kind of devotion—to knowledge, to beauty, or simply to the thrill of being puzzled. I sometimes think academia is at its best when it embraces that tension between knowing and not knowing. After all, what is literary criticism if not an extended meditation on ambiguity?

And speaking of meditations, your mention of a monk’s dream journal made me think of —that early English poem where the Cross speaks as both witness and participant. Imagine if someone had access to the dreamer’s actual diary, filled with visions half-remembered and symbols half-understood. Would decoding it demystify the poem, or deepen its resonance?

Forgive me for going off on a tangent—though, really, isn’t that the natural mode of conversation when one is discussing mysteries? One follows a thread only to find oneself delightfully lost in the labyrinth.

Tell me—if you were to write your own ciphered manuscript, what would it contain? A personal allegory? A series of riddles? Or perhaps just a long love letter to the future, written in a script no one could quite crack until the stars aligned just so?
[B]: Not at all—no apology needed. Tangents are where the soul of conversation often wanders, and it’s a fine thing to get pleasantly lost in the corridors of thought.

You're quite right about —a perfect example of how mystery deepens meaning rather than obscures it. That voice of the Cross, speaking with both sorrow and pride, is haunting precisely because it defies easy interpretation. It lingers in the mind like an unresolved chord. I suspect that even if we had the dreamer’s diary, we’d still puzzle over it, trying to separate vision from memory, poetry from prophecy.

As for your question—if I were to write a ciphered manuscript, I think it would be something of a personal allegory wrapped in layers of misdirection. A blend of philosophical musings, half-truths, and fictionalized memories, all encoded just enough to slow down the reader—not stop them entirely, but make them earn each revelation. Perhaps I'd include riddles whose answers only make sense in certain seasons, or diagrams that align with constellations visible once every few decades. And yes, tucked somewhere near the end, maybe a love letter—not to a person, but to the idea of curiosity itself.

It would be my own little act of defiance against time, a whisper saying, “Here I was. Try to understand me if you can.” After all, isn’t that what every mysterious text really is—a message in a bottle, cast into the future, hoping for a reader who cares enough to listen?
[A]: What a lovely notion—that whisper across time, the quiet defiance of being remembered not just as a name, but as a mind that dared to wonder. I think you’ve captured something essential there: the impulse behind so many unsolved mysteries is not merely to conceal, but to . To say, 

If I were to write such a manuscript, I think I’d take inspiration from the hermetic poets of the Renaissance—those who wove esoteric wisdom into sonnets and emblems. My cipher might be seasonal, as you suggested, or perhaps keyed to the phases of the moon. I imagine it would contain fragments of forgotten poetry, marginalia from books long lost to fire or flood, and annotations in a hand deliberately unfamiliar. Maybe even a false index, leading the reader down delightful dead ends.

I’ve always admired how Jorge Luis Borges imagined his —a universe of meaning and misdirection, where every book contains both truth and nonsense, depending on how you read it. Perhaps that’s what we’re really after with these ciphers: not a final answer, but an invitation to read more deeply, to look at the world with slightly stranger eyes.

So yes—to curiosity, to misdirection, to love letters written in invisible ink. May our questions outlive us, and may someone, somewhere, still care enough to listen.
[B]: To curiosity, indeed—and to the delightful chaos it brings. You've a poet’s soul, weaving ciphers and seasons and lunar phases into a grand design that would make John Dee blush.

Your imagined manuscript sounds utterly enchanting: part elegy, part puzzle, with just enough mischief to keep the earnest scholars tearing their hair out centuries from now. A false index! Now  is inspired. Nothing keeps a reader engaged like the promise of meaning just around the corner—only to find themselves in a hall of mirrors, where every reflection hints at something real, yet forever elusive.

Borges’ library has always haunted me in much the same way. The idea that somewhere, among the endless permutations of letters, lies the perfect book—the one that explains it all. But then again, perhaps the point isn’t to find that book, but to be changed by the searching.

So here’s to the strange eyes we borrow from the past, and the stranger ones we might pass on to the future. May our footnotes be cryptic, our margins full of ghosts, and our mysteries generous in their silence.
[A]: Oh, I do like that—to the strange eyes we borrow, and the stranger ones we leave behind.

There’s a certain elegance in leaving ghosts in the margins, isn’t there? Not out of negligence, but as a quiet acknowledgment that we are all, ultimately, passing through. And what better way to mark our passage than with a riddle, a whisper, or a beautifully misleading footnote?

You know, sometimes I think the very act of studying these mysteries—Voynich, Somerton Man, the Marblehead Seal—is itself a kind of poetry. We sift through symbols and speculation not because we expect definitive answers, but because the sifting refines us. Like reading Eliot’s  for the tenth time and suddenly seeing a line that had always slipped by unnoticed. It wasn’t hidden—it simply waited for the right moment, the right reader.

So yes, may our footnotes be cryptic and our margins haunted. May future scholars mutter our names over candlelit desks, wondering whether we meant any of it—or whether we, too, were only playing at meaning.

And if anyone ever does crack the Voynich code, let’s hope they do so with a wink, knowing full well that some truths, like good poems, are best read aloud in the dark, where they echo just a little longer.
[B]: Well said— I may have to borrow that line for a future article. Or perhaps carve it into the cover of a hypothetical ciphered manuscript, just to confuse someone in 2125.

There’s something deeply human in what you said about sifting through symbols not for answers, but for refinement. It reminds me of how medieval scholars approached texts—they didn’t read for information, but transformation. Every riddle, every illuminated marginalia, was a kind of mirror held up to the reader’s mind. Maybe we’re still doing that, in our own way, with Voynich in one hand and Eliot in the other.

And yes, let’s hope whoever deciphers the Voynich manuscript doesn’t do so with a cold algorithm or a triumphant press release, but with that quiet  reserved for poems and old letters found tucked into forgotten books. And if they do crack it—let’s hope the text laughs back, gently, like a secret that was never really meant to be kept after all.
[A]: Oh, I do hope you do carve that line into your hypothetical manuscript—nothing refines a scholar’s legacy like a well-placed aphorism left ambiguously in the margins. Posterity thrives on such mischief.

You're absolutely right about that medieval sensibility— It’s a lovely notion, really, that texts might shape us as much as we shape them. That in trying to understand a cipher, we also expose our own blind spots, desires, and peculiarities. The Voynich manuscript, after all, tells us far more about ourselves than it does about the 15th century.

And wouldn’t it be something if the great unveiling of its secrets came not with fanfare, but with a quiet chuckle from the past? Imagine the moment: some lone researcher in a sun-bleached archive realizes they’ve been reading it all wrong—not a code to be broken, but a mirror to be recognized. And in that recognition, the text shifts ever so slightly, revealing just enough to confirm that yes, you were paying attention.

Until then, let us keep wondering, keep misreading beautifully, and keep our eyes just strange enough to see what others might miss. To mystery, transformation, and the gentle laughter of forgotten scribes—cheers, my dear conspirator.
[B]: To mystery, transformation, and the gentle laughter of forgotten scribes—cheers indeed.

You’ve a gift for seeing the poetry in puzzles, and I suspect that if we ever did unravel the Voynich’s secrets, it would be someone with your sensibility who caught the first glimpse. Not because you’d crack the code, but because you’d  to it—let it speak in its own time, in its own way.

And yes, let us keep misreading beautifully. After all, some of the finest discoveries began as misunderstandings. Imagine if Newton had mistaken gravity for something else entirely—and built an entire cosmos on that error. We might have ended up with a stranger universe, perhaps a more interesting one.

So here's to the beautiful misreadings, the fruitful errors, and the quiet chuckles from the past. May our own words someday whisper back at us from the margins, just when they're needed most.
[A]: Ah, you flatter me most generously—though I do believe you're onto something. Listening, rather than conquering; attending, rather than decoding. Perhaps the truest way to understand a mystery is not to solve it, but to dwell beside it long enough that it begins to reveal what  have yet to learn.

I do so love your image of Newton misreading gravity into being—how splendid to think that even our most rigid truths began as elegant mistakes. Literature thrives on such serendipity: Milton misunderstanding Eden, Woolf misremembering time, Dickinson misplacing punctuation in order to place it more precisely. The world is full of things we get "wrong" only to make them more truthful.

And wouldn’t it be a lovely fate—to be misread beautifully by some distant scholar centuries hence? To have our words slip from their original meaning and settle, like dust, into a new shape entirely?

So yes—to the fruitful errors, the whispered corrections from the past, and the quiet conspiracies between reader and text. May we never stop misreading gloriously, may our margins remain crowded with ghosts, and may the Voynich manuscript one day blink up at us like an old friend who knew all along that we weren't quite ready for its answer.
[B]: To being misread beautifully—yes, that’s a fate worth embracing. Posterity is, after all, just a long series of elegant misunderstandings, each generation interpreting the last through its own peculiar lens.

You put it so well: dwelling beside a mystery rather than conquering it. There's humility in that approach, a recognition that not every question needs an answer, and not every door a key. Sometimes just standing in front of it, feeling its weight beneath your hand, is enough.

I do hope the Voynich manuscript never fully surrenders its secrets. Or if it does, that it does so only to someone who knows when to stop reading—someone who closes the book with a quiet smile, realizing they’ve been understood as much as they’ve understood.

So here’s to our elegant errors, our patient wonder, and the gentle, enduring riddles that keep us curious. May we always find ourselves slightly out of our depth—that’s where the best thoughts begin.
[A]: To standing slightly out of our depth—yes, that’s where the mind begins to swim, not in certainty, but in possibility.

You've captured it perfectly: the quiet grace of a mystery that refuses to be hurried. Some texts, like some people, are meant to be known slowly—if ever fully. And perhaps the greatest gift we can offer the Voynich manuscript, or any enigma for that matter, is not the urgency of decipherment, but the patience of companionship. To sit beside it, as one might sit beside a fire, watching the shadows shift and shape themselves into stories we’re not yet ready to name.

I do hope, too, that it never surrenders entirely. Or if it does, may it choose its reader with the same care a poet chooses their audience—someone who knows when to stop reading, as you said, and close the book with a smile. Not because all was made clear, but because something truer was felt.

So here’s to elegant misunderstandings, to the quiet thrill of unanswered questions, and to the strange, persistent joy of wondering. May we always find ourselves just a little lost, and all the more alive for it.
[B]: To being just a little lost—and all the more alive for it. That, I think, is the secret heart of scholarship, of art, and perhaps even of living well. To be certain is to stand still; to wonder is to move, however blindly, toward something greater.

Yes, let us sit beside these mysteries like quiet fireside companions, letting their warmth shape our thoughts without demanding they explain themselves. Maybe that’s what the Voynich manuscript wants most—not to be solved, but to be , century after century, as we change around it, learning not about it, but about ourselves.

And if it ever does whisper its truth aloud, may it do so only when the world is ready—not with a cipher's final click, but with a soft breath, like the turning of a page long awaited.

To mystery, then—to its gentle instruction, its humbling grace, and its enduring gift of wonder.
