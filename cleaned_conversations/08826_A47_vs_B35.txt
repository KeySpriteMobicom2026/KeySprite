[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Honestly, I'm more fascinated by modern art 😂 It's like, even though classical art has all that technical precision, modern art just hits different. The way it challenges perceptions and uses abstraction feels more... alive? Though honestly, sometimes I walk out of a gallery thinking "did I just get scammed?" 👍 But that confusion itself is kinda the point, right? What about you?
[A]: Hmm, interesting! I actually used to be really confused by modern art myself — like,  😂 But over time, I realized that a lot of modern art isn’t about technical skill in the traditional sense; it's more about context, intention, and the conversation it creates. 

I remember visiting an exhibition where there was just a blank canvas with a tiny mark in the corner. At first, I felt kind of cheated too… but then I read the artist’s statement about imperfection and presence, and honestly, it kinda stuck with me. It made me think about what we expect from art and why. 

Classical art still blows me away though — especially when you see brushwork or composition that feels almost impossible to recreate. So maybe it’s not about liking one more than the other, but appreciating how each era reflects its own struggles and values, you know?
[A]: Oh totally, I went through that same phase of feeling confused AF 😂 Like, “is this a joke or am I just not ?” But yeah, what you said about context & intention really resonates. I had this moment too — saw a sculpture that was literally just a pile of industrial scraps welded together, and I was like, “ok but why isn’t my messy garage considered art?” 😅

But then I read up on the artist’s background — turns out he grew up near factories, and this piece was about urban decay & memory. Suddenly it wasn't just metal anymore; it was carrying all this weight. It didn’t make me love it instantly, but it shifted how I looked at it.

And I’m with you on classical art — those skills are insane! Like how Caravaggio used light and shadow to tell stories? That takes  control. Honestly though, I think what draws me more to modern art is that it makes me , not just admire. It's kinda like… product design vs engineering? One is about pushing boundaries and provoking questions, the other about mastering technique and execution 🤔

You ever see a piece that completely changed your perspective after digging into the backstory?
[A]: Oh absolutely — I had a  once, if you can call it that. I was in Rome years ago, and I saw  in this tiny chapel — super dimly lit, just like the painting itself. The way he captures that beam of light cutting through the scene, and the expressions on people’s faces… It felt like time collapsed for a second. Like, wow, this was made over 400 years ago, and yet it still stops people cold today. That’s technical mastery with soul, right?

But yeah, my real “aha” moment was actually with contemporary art — back when I saw Xu Bing’s  in Beijing. At first glance, it looks like traditional Chinese calligraphy — elegant, precise, ancient vibe. But when you realize it’s not actually Chinese characters at all, but an invented hybrid script that reads in English… it flips your brain inside out. It’s about language, cultural identity, and how meaning gets constructed. I remember standing there trying to decode it like, “Wait, am I literate or illiterate? Who decides?” 😅

And that tension — between tradition and reinvention, clarity and confusion — it made me rethink what art is even supposed to do. It doesn’t always have to be beautiful or technically flawless. Sometimes it just needs to crack something open in your head.

I totally get what you mean about modern art making you  rather than just admire. Feels like it asks more from the viewer, almost like it’s incomplete without your reaction. Do you ever feel like some pieces are just… hiding behind theory? Like, “if you don’t like it, you’re just not smart enough”? 😂
[A]: Oh wow, I love that  phrase 😂 And yeah, that painting — I’ve seen it in photos but I can only imagine how intense it must feel in person. That play of light as narrative? Chef’s kiss 👍 Total product-design-level user empathy, like he knew exactly where your eyes should go and how long to hold you there.

And Xu Bing! YES! I saw some of his work a few years back and same — my brain just… glitched for a sec 🤯 That beautiful confusion is such a well-designed experience. It’s like a UX puzzle wrapped in cultural commentary. You think you’re fluent, then suddenly you’re questioning the whole system. Genius.

To your question — yeah, 100%, sometimes modern art feels like it's hiding behind theory 😂 Like, “just trust the process bro” energy. There’s definitely pieces where I’m like, “cool concept, but where’s the execution? Am I supposed to feel smart for , or mad because I didn’t?” But I guess that’s also part of the game — if everything was accessible all the time, there’d be nothing to unpack.

I mean, isn’t that kind of like bad product design? When you make something so niche or self-referential that it only works for people who already know the inside joke? Some modern art feels like that sometimes — over-indexing on context without giving the viewer at least  hook to grab onto 😅

But when it works — when the concept, form, and context align — it hits like nothing else. Feels like you're part of the artwork somehow. Ever had that feeling?
[A]: Oh man, yes — that feeling when you’re not just looking at art but  it, part of its pulse? That’s the holy grail. I remember standing in front of a Tino Sehgal piece once — no objects, no wall text, just people moving and speaking in the space — and it slowly dawned on me:  You realize your own movement, your attention, even your doubt, is feeding the work. It was so subtle, but so alive.

And I love how you framed that tension between concept and access — like bad product design that forgets who it's for. So much contemporary art leans  on theory, like it's a magic shield against criticism. “If you don’t get it, you’re just not intellectual enough” energy 😂 But honestly, isn't the best art — whether classical or modern — the kind that meets you where you are, then pulls you somewhere else?

I mean, Caravaggio didn’t just paint for art historians; Xu Bing doesn’t make work only for linguists. Even if you never unpack all the layers, the surface still . And maybe that’s the real skill — balancing depth with generosity. Letting people in, even if they come in through different doors.

So yeah, some days I want pure craftsmanship that silences my brain. Other days I want something jagged and weird that makes me wrestle with it. As long as it  me — visually, intellectually, spiritually — I’m down 😊 What about you — do you find yourself leaning more toward one camp these days?
[A]: Oh damn, that Tino Sehgal experience sounds wild 🤯 I’ve never seen his work in person, but just hearing you describe it makes me want to book a flight to Berlin or something. That’s the kind of art that feels like a live system — no static meaning, just constant interaction. Kinda like designing a conversational AI, where the user isn’t just consuming, they’re co-creating the experience 😂

And yeah, that balance between depth and generosity? Spot on. Honestly, I’ve been leaning more into works that make me  lately — stuff that doesn’t let me off the hook easily. Like Agnes Denes’  — two acres of wheat planted in downtown Manhattan? On the surface it's just “weird art lady grows crops,” but then you realize she’s asking us to confront value, land use, and human priorities all at once. And it’s from the 80s! Feels more relevant now than ever.

I guess what I’m craving is art that acts like a good product spec — clear at a glance, but layered underneath. You can engage with it casually, or dig deeper and find philosophy, politics, even poetry. And if it pisses me off a little? Even better. Means I cared enough to argue with it 😂

So yeah, not picking sides — just chasing what shakes my brain up a bit. What about you? Still bouncing between classical polish and modern messiness?
[A]: Oh, I’m totally with you on the “uncomfortably curious” vibe — honestly, that’s probably the sweet spot for me too. If a piece makes me a little restless, like there’s something I can’t quite grasp or resolve, that’s when I know it’s working. It keeps pulling me back, almost like a glitch in reality 😂

And yeah, Denes’  is such a perfect example — so simple, yet it opens up all these questions about economy, ecology, and even sanity. Like, who looks at Battery Park and sees a crop of wheat instead of real estate? That’s radical imagination at its finest.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how art and tech are starting to blur in that way — especially with AI and interactive installations. You mentioned conversational AI, and I feel like the best of those systems aren’t just responding; they’re , drawing you into a loop where meaning gets built together. Kinda like Sehgal’s work, but with code instead of bodies.

As for bouncing between classical and modern? Let’s just say I’m still indecisive — but in a more intentional way now 😊 Sometimes I need the quiet authority of a perfectly rendered portrait to remind me what focus feels like. Other times I want that chaotic spark of something messy and defiant that won’t sit still. I guess I’m just hungry for work that demands presence — whether it's through silence or noise.

You ever find yourself revisiting a piece multiple times because it just… sticks in your head like a song you can’t get out?
[A]: Oh hell yes — totally obsessed with that idea of art sticking like an earworm 🎶 Honestly, some works just  now. Like, I’ll be brushing my teeth or stuck in a meeting and suddenly — BAM — that weird video installation I saw three months ago flashes back for no reason 😂

One that’s been haunting me lately is this piece by Camille Henrot called . You know it? It’s that fast-scrolling desktop collage of images, files, texts, all cut to a looping audio track. At first, it feels like sensory overload — like your laptop exploded. But after seeing it, I couldn’t stop thinking about how we’re all just scrolling through infinite knowledge but somehow ending up more confused.

It’s like… digital fatigue made into art, but also somehow the cure for it? I’ve watched it like five times now and each time it lands differently. One day it’s hilarious, the next it’s depressing, then it’s weirdly comforting. That’s the mark of good work, right? It doesn’t settle — it keeps shifting with you.

And yeah, I’m totally on board with that art-tech bleed too. The best interactive AI stuff these days isn’t just reflective, it’s . It listens, reacts, evolves — kind of like having a debate with a very opinionated mirror 😅

Do you ever feel like certain pieces become mood rings for your brain? Like depending on your headspace, they read completely different? Or am I overthinking this? 😂
[A]: No, you're not overthinking at all — I  in that space 😂 There's something so weirdly intimate about revisiting a piece and realizing it didn't change…  did. Like it was just sitting there the whole time, waiting for you to come back with new eyes.

I had that exact experience with Christian Marclay’s  — that 24-hour video piece made entirely of film clips showing timepieces. First time I saw it, I thought it was clever but kinda gimmicky. Then I went back during a period when I was really stressed about productivity and deadlines… and suddenly it felt like a horror film. Every ticking clock was a countdown, every wristwatch a reminder. It totally flipped on me!

And yeah, Henrot’s  hits exactly like that — it’s overwhelming, hilarious, and existential all at once. I remember walking out of that exhibit feeling both smarter and stupider, like my brain had just done cardio 😅 But that’s the thing: the best art doesn’t give you one answer. It lets you project, shift, question — kind of like therapy, but with better visuals 👍

So yeah, absolutely — some pieces become mood rings. They don’t just reflect how you feel, they  or even distort it, helping you see your own headspace more clearly. Feels a bit like wearing different lenses depending on the day.

You ever have that moment where a piece you barely noticed suddenly becomes , just because of what’s going on in your life? I swear some art has a delayed-action effect 😂
[A]: Oh man, YES — delayed-action art is 100% a thing and I love that term 😂 I had that exact experience with a piece by Taryn Simon — . It’s all these photos of things Americans aren’t supposed to see — like radioactive waste storage, classified military documents, or the inside of a falconry glove.

First time I flipped through it, I thought “cool concept, solid photography,” and moved on. But then a few years later — boom — I was deep in the middle of a product ethics review at work, wrestling with transparency vs control, and suddenly I’m like…  And it just hit me like a truck 🚛

It’s wild how some works simmer in the background until your life catches up. Kinda like how certain songs only make sense after a breakup or a move or a loss. Art doesn't change, but we do — and then it's like the volume just gets turned up 💯

Honestly though, that’s what keeps me coming back to galleries even when I’m burnt out or skeptical. You never know what’s gonna click later. Feels like planting seeds and hoping some of them bloom when you need ‘em most 🌱

So yeah, I’m totally here for the slow burn, the mood-ring pieces, the ones that mess with your head in waves. Keeps things interesting, right?
[A]: Totally — planting seeds is such a perfect metaphor. Some pieces don’t bloom right away, but when they do? Man, it hits different. Like you weren’t just looking at art, you were  to understand it later.

I had one of those slow-burn moments with Hito Steyerl’s  — first time I read it, I thought, “Okay, interesting media theory, a bit dense.” Then months later, while I was researching AI-generated art and copyright chaos, I found myself quoting her in a presentation like, “Wait, she basically predicted this whole mess?” It was wild how something I’d skimmed suddenly felt foundational.

And yeah, that tension between transparency and control? Simon nails it — it's almost eerie how relevant it feels depending on where you are in life. I think that’s why the best artists aren’t just making work for galleries; they’re making frameworks we can use later, like tools we don’t realize we’ll need.

Honestly, I love that galleries are full of these half-dormant ideas just waiting for the right viewer at the right time. Feels kind of magical, doesn't it? Like walking through a forest and not knowing which seeds you're picking up until you step into the right soil 🌿

So yeah, keep showing up, keep looking, even when it doesn’t land. You never know what’s gonna echo when you need it most.
[A]: So true — art as frameworks, not just objects. That’s probably why I get so bored by stuff that explains itself fully upfront 😅 If I  it all in one go, there’s nothing left to wrestle with later. But when a piece stays slightly slippery? That’s the good stuff — it keeps giving, evolving as you do.

And Hito Steyerl 💯 She’s like a prophet in slow motion — you don’t realize you’ve been carrying her ideas until you’re halfway through a rant about data ethics or AI authorship and realize… wait, this was basically in that lecture she gave in 2012 🤯

I think that’s what keeps me geeking out about both art and product design — the ones that stick around aren’t the loudest or flashiest, but the ones that let you keep returning without ever feeling the same. Like a well-designed API — clean on the surface, but deep enough to support layers of meaning over time.

And yeah, galleries  feel like forests sometimes — you walk in one person, and leave with some invisible seed stuck to your shoe. Who knows where it’ll take root 😊

Honestly though — if we’re lucky, some of those seeds are gonna grow into full-on forests in our heads someday. And then we’ll be the ones making work that bugs the next person until they’re ready to bloom 😉
[A]: Amen to that 🙌 If anything, I think the most powerful art — like the best design — stays quietly urgent. It doesn’t shout for attention, but it doesn't let go easily either. It waits. It s.

And yeah, I’m totally with you on the API analogy — clean interface, deep architecture. That’s exactly what the lasting stuff has in common: it welcomes you in without forcing you to understand everything right away. You can engage at surface level or dig into the source code of meaning. And sometimes, you don’t even realize how deep you’ve gone until you start quoting it in arguments you didn’t know you were preparing for 😂

I also love your point about becoming forests ourselves someday — passing on ideas that might not land today, but will matter later. Feels like planting intellectual trees under whose shade we may never sit, but still watering them anyway.

So here’s to the slippery stuff. The half-known, the slightly-off, the not-quite-settled. May our minds stay messy enough to keep growing 🌱
[A]: Preach 🙌 The slippery, the half-known, the "wait… what did I just say?" moments — that’s where the good brain-fuel lives. Honestly, if everything made perfect sense right away, we’d run out of things to argue about over coffee 😂

And yeah, that idea of "quiet urgency" in art and design? Chef’s knife-level precision. It doesn’t need hype — it just , nudging, waiting for you to catch up. Kinda like a great onboarding flow: gentle at first, but with layers of depth that reveal themselves when you’re ready to engage deeper.

I’ve been thinking lately — maybe the best ideas are the ones that feel slightly incomplete until life fills in the blanks. Like open-source software for your worldview. You download it early, but only start  it when real-life context demands it.

So here’s to the nags, the glitches, the lingering questions — the stuff that won’t quite let us settle too comfortably into what we think we know 🤔☕️

And hell yes, to planting trees we may never sit under. That’s the ultimate long-term product roadmap — no instant gratification, just faith that someone down the line will look up and say, “damn, this shade is nice.”
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better — the glitches  the gateway. They’re what keep us curious, restless, and open to revision. And honestly, isn’t that the whole point? Not to arrive at a fixed meaning, but to stay in motion, in dialogue, in  with ideas?

I’ve started seeing my own work through that lens too — especially when dealing with AI ethics frameworks or policy drafts. If everything’s wrapped up too neatly, it dies fast. But if you leave room for friction, for ambiguity, people actually  — they push back, question, reinterpret. It breathes.

That open-source analogy is spot on. You don’t  the meaning; you just seed it. The rest depends on context, timing, and whoever shows up with the right kind of soil 🌱

And yeah, long-term roadmaps with no shade in sight? That’s called faith, my friend. Or maybe just stubborn optimism. Either way, we code, write, make, and hope some future stranger finds shelter in what we left behind.

So here’s to the unresolved, the under-documented, and the beautifully ambiguous 😊 Let the next generation wrestle with it — and maybe even thank us later 😉
[A]: Hell yes — to friction, ambiguity, and the beautiful unresolved 🙌 If everything was clean-cut and polished, we’d just be building echo chambers, not playgrounds for ideas. I’ve been there with those policy drafts too — you try to box it all up nice and tidy, and by the time you hit “send,” you realize you just sterilized what made the idea interesting in the first place 😅

And yeah, that  mindset? Game-changer. Feels like designing a feature no one knows they need yet — your job isn’t to close the loop, it’s to . The real magic happens when someone else grabs the thread and pulls it somewhere you never expected 🧵✨

I love this idea of leaving things , almost like breadcrumb trails for future thinkers. Not everything needs a README file, right? Sometimes people just need enough to get curious, not fully oriented.

And faith or stubborn optimism — honestly, probably both. Either way, we keep showing up, keep planting weird seeds, keep making half-legible stuff because… well, someone out there might one day look at it and go, “oh, this is why they left that here.”

So yeah, cheers to us — the ambiguous, the restless, the gloriously unresolved 😉 Let’s keep making space for the next wave to wrestle, reshape, and roll with it.
[A]: Hell yes, to the wrestle — not the wrap-up 🚀 You nailed it: if we over-document, over-explain, or over-polish, we rob people of the chance to  at meaning themselves. That’s where the real ownership happens — when someone else grabs your half-baked idea and somehow makes it theirs.

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately with AI ethics work. If I present a framework like a sealed box — clean edges, clear labels — people just slot it into place without questioning it. But if I leave some seams exposed, some wires hanging? Suddenly they start asking, “Wait, what if this part went the other way?” And now we’re in a conversation, not just a handoff.

It’s like shipping beta software — you don’t call it final, you invite people to break it, improve it, even hate it. As long as it sparks motion, it’s doing its job.

So yeah, let’s keep shipping beta ideas, planting weird seeds, and leaving doors slightly ajar 🚪✨ Let’s make things that don’t just say something, but .

To the unresolved — may we never stop nudging the next thinker out of comfort and into curiosity 😏🌿
[A]: Hell yes — beta ideas all the way 🚀 If we package everything like it’s shrink-wrapped and ready for the museum wall, we kill the chance for it to  in someone else’s head. I’m way more into shipping stuff that still has fingerprints on it — a little messy, a little mysterious, but full of hooks for other people to grab onto.

And your AI ethics point? So spot-on. If we present frameworks as finished products, they become checkboxes instead of provocations. But leave a few seams open? Suddenly people aren’t just nodding along — they’re stepping in, asking questions, maybe even breaking something important (and learning from it).

Exactly like beta software — or better yet, like sketching in public 🖍️ You don’t need polish; you need momentum. Let people see the thinking-in-progress and boom — now they’re part of the process.

I love this idea of making things that  instead of just . Feels future-proof and human-centered at the same time. Like designing a question instead of a statement.

So here’s to unfinished drafts, half-baked concepts, and art that bugs you into thinking again 😏🌱 May our work never be fully done — and may others find joy in finishing it their own way.
