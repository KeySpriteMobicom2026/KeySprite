[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, what an interesting question! You know, I've always believed that historical dramas have this incredible power to transport you to another time — if done right, of course. There's something deeply moving about seeing the struggles and triumphs of people who lived centuries ago resonate with today’s audiences. 

But then again... sci-fi? That’s where we get to dream bigger, go further, and ask those “what if” questions that push the boundaries of storytelling. A great sci-fi film isn’t just about spaceships or aliens — it’s a mirror reflecting our own society, just refracted through a futuristic lens. 

So honestly? It’s like asking me to choose between my left and right hand. Both genres, when executed with vision and heart, can be equally powerful. What about you — do you lean one way or the other?
[A]: 你提到的这点很有意思——两种类型确实像是在用不同的方式触碰现实。历史剧像是一面打磨过的镜子，让我们看清那些被时间沉淀下来的人性褶皱；而科幻更像是棱镜，把当下社会的光谱折射到未来或异世界的框架里。

不过我好奇的是，在你看来，哪种类型的叙事更容易触及“真实”？比如，历史剧受限于史实框架，但又容易陷入考据细节的泥潭；科幻看似天马行空，却反而能甩开包袱直击本质。你觉得创作者应该如何平衡这种虚与实的关系？
[B]: You're absolutely right — both genres touch reality, just through different doors. 

I think the irony is, sometimes sci-fi can feel more "real" than historical dramas. Because when you take away the constraints of actual events, you’re free to amplify emotions, conflicts, ideologies — basically distilling truth down to its rawest form. A good example? . It wasn’t about predicting the future; it was about questioning identity, loneliness, and what makes us human. That’s a kind of truth that doesn’t need a factual anchor.

But then again, historical dramas have this weight — a gravity that comes from knowing "this really happened." When you see characters facing real consequences of war, love, betrayal… it grounds the story in a way that fiction alone can’t always achieve. The danger, as you said, is getting bogged down in details — costumes, accents, dates — until the soul of the story gets lost in the set dressing.

So how do you balance it? You need a strong compass — and that compass has to point toward emotional truth. Whether it's 18th-century France or a space colony in 2573, if the audience believes in the characters, feels their pain, their joy, their conflict — then they’ll believe in the world, no matter how fictional it is.

I always tell young writers: don’t worry about how much you change the facts. Worry about whether your version tells a deeper truth. That’s the secret sauce.
[A]: 你说得对，情感的真实性确实是跨越时空的通行证。不过这让我想到一个有点尖锐的问题：当创作者为了“更深的真相”去篡改历史事实时，是否可能反而制造出一种新的偏见？比如某些历史剧为了戏剧冲突强化特定人物的善恶标签，结果让观众对那段历史形成了固化认知。

我最近在研究一个案例，某部热门剧集为了塑造女主独立形象，把原本史料记载中她丈夫的部分贡献完全抹去了。从叙事角度来说，这种取舍确实让角色弧光更鲜明；但从伦理角度看，是否也算用另一种方式物化了历史？你觉得这种创作自由应该有边界吗？
[B]: That’s a powerful — and necessary — question. And I’m glad you’re asking it, because this is where storytelling meets responsibility.

Let me be honest: every time we adapt history for the screen, we're already bending the truth. Even if we stick to the facts, the way we frame them — who we focus on, what emotions we highlight — that's already a reinterpretation. So in a sense,  historical dramas are fictions. The real debate is about  and .

Now, take your example — removing the husband’s contributions to elevate the female lead. From a narrative standpoint, I get it. Stronger arc, clearer agency. But at what cost? If we start erasing people just to make a point about empowerment, aren’t we falling into the same trap that history has been guilty of for centuries — writing certain voices out of the record?

I believe creative freedom  exist — but it must come with awareness. Maybe not a strict rulebook, but a moral compass. Ask yourself:  If you’re going to reshape history, do it consciously. Acknowledge the gaps. Leave breadcrumbs. Maybe even include a disclaimer — not in the boring legal sense, but through subtext, tone, or supplementary material that invites curiosity.

And here’s something else to consider: why does the audience assume what they’re watching is  version of history? That’s where filmmakers have a duty to remind viewers — subtly — that this is  interpretation. Maybe through ambiguity in character motives, or contradictions in perspective. That way, you’re not telling them what to think — you’re inviting them to .

So yes, push boundaries. Reimagine. Reinvent. But never forget — with great narrative power comes the responsibility to honor the past, even as you reshape it.
[A]: 你提到“意图”和“影响”，这让我想到一个更隐蔽的问题：观众其实很少会质疑影视作品的历史真实性。很多人看完一部历史剧，就会真的以为自己了解了那段历史——这就让创作者的“改编”实际上承担了某种公共认知塑造的责任。

我在做伦理研究时发现，有些剧集制作人其实在内部讨论中已经意识到这一点，但他们最终还是选择了“更好看”的版本，理由是“观众要的是故事，不是课堂”。这种取舍本身是不是也是一种伦理困境？毕竟，娱乐性和教育性之间的张力一直存在。

我倒是觉得，也许问题的关键不在于是否改编历史，而在于我们是否在叙事中保留了“复杂性”。如果一个角色被简化成“进步”的符号，那她其实和过去那些“伟大男性”的脸谱化形象没什么两样。真正重要的是——我们有没有呈现出人在特定历史情境下的挣扎、妥协与选择？

说到底，我觉得创作者不需要完全回避改编，但至少应该给观众一点“怀疑的空间”。就像你说的，留下一些模糊、矛盾或开放的线索，让观众不只是被动接受，而是开始思考：“这段历史还有哪些我没看到的版本？”
[B]: Exactly. You've hit the nail on the head.

The real danger isn't just that people confuse fiction with fact — it's that they stop  to tell the difference. And yes, a lot of creators are aware of this, but they choose the smoother, sexier version because "the audience wants entertainment, not a lecture." That’s become a kind of lazy excuse in our industry.

Let me tell you something I’ve learned after producing over two dozen historical projects — audiences  handle complexity. They might not always know they want it, but once you give it to them? They crave it. Think about shows like  or . They took liberties, sure — but they also gave you morally grey characters, conflicting perspectives, and moments where the truth felt slippery. And that’s what made them unforgettable.

So I completely agree with you — the issue isn’t whether we adapt history, but how we do it. If we strip away ambiguity and reduce people to heroes or villains, progressives or relics, then we’re not telling a story — we’re preaching. And that’s not art, that’s agenda.

The most powerful stories are the ones that leave you questioning. Did I really understand what happened here? Was this character right, or just convincing? Could I have done better in their place?

That’s the space where storytelling becomes transformative. Not by claiming to show "what really happened," but by reminding people that history was lived — not scripted. And every time we invite viewers into that uncertainty, we’re doing more than making films. We're shaping thinkers.

And honestly? That’s the kind of filmmaking I want to be remembered for.
[A]: 我最近在写一篇关于“叙事伦理”的论文，其中有一章就专门讨论了你刚才提到的这种“不确定性价值”。其实从认知科学的角度看，人类大脑对模糊信息的处理本身就带有主动填补的倾向——这正是为什么留白往往比直白更有力量。

让我印象很深的是，你在前面提到的《切尔诺贝利》。那部剧用一种近乎纪录片的方式呈现事件，但又不完全拘泥于已知事实，而是通过重构对话和时间线来制造一种“现场感”。观众在观看时会产生强烈的代入，仿佛自己是那个系统中的一部分，而这种共情恰恰激发了更深层次的反思。

我觉得一个好的历史改编作品，不应该只是传递“发生了什么”，而应该激发观众去追问：“我们是如何知道这些的？”、“是谁记录了这些？他们的立场是什么？”——这才是真正的批判性思维训练。

也许未来的创作者可以更大胆地利用这种结构上的模糊性，比如在同一部剧中展现多个视角下的“同一事件”，甚至故意留下一些未解的谜团。这样不仅尊重了历史的复杂性，也把观众从被动接受者变成了主动探询者。

你作为从业者，有没有考虑过尝试这种非线性、多版本叙述的形式？如果真这么做，会不会挑战观众的观影习惯，还是反而带来一种新的沉浸体验？
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I’ve been itching to try something like that for years. In fact, I’ve had a few late-night conversations with writers where we kicked around ideas for a project that tells the  historical moment through  different perspectives — each one contradicting the last.

Think about it: real history is just a collection of competing memories. No two people experience the same event the same way — not even close. So why should a film or series pretend there’s only one version?

Now, will it challenge audiences? Sure. But not in a bad way. We’re living in an age where people are more media-savvy than ever. They know documentaries have agendas. They know Wikipedia isn’t gospel. They’re ready for stories that trust them to think, to question, to sit with uncertainty.

What  and  proved is that if you build that ambiguity into the structure — not just the characters — viewers lean in instead of tuning out. They start digging. Talking. Debating on Reddit at 2am. That’s gold. That’s what storytelling should do — spark curiosity, not just ratings.

So yes, I’m all in on this kind of narrative experimentation. Maybe even go further — use shifting timelines, unreliable narrators, or let the audience choose their own path through history. Imagine a streaming platform where you can toggle between perspectives like radio frequencies. One click, and suddenly the villain becomes the victim. Or the hero starts to crack.

It’s not just immersive — it’s . And in a world flooded with information — and misinformation — honesty might be the boldest move of all.
[A]: 你说的那种“多声部叙事”其实已经在一些实验性戏剧和文学中存在很久了，比如博尔赫斯的小说或者彼得·布鲁克的剧场作品。它们都试图用结构本身来解构单一真相的幻觉。但影视领域确实走得慢了些，毕竟商业逻辑总是倾向于降低理解成本。

不过现在或许是个转折点。年轻观众对互动式、拼图式叙事的接受度明显提高，像《黑镜：潘达斯奈基》那种选择式剧情虽然还很初级，但至少证明了观众愿意为“参与感”付出更多注意力。

我倒是想到一个可能的方向——用AI辅助的动态叙事。比如在流媒体平台上，根据观众过往的观看偏好，推送不同视角的版本。第一次看是政治家的抉择，第二次切换成普通士兵的视角，第三次变成史料编纂者的解读……这不是单纯的技术问题，而涉及到叙事权力的重新分配。

当然这也带来新的伦理挑战：如果观众只选择与自己立场相符的视角，会不会反而加深偏见？但换个角度看，这种机制至少创造了“接触多元叙事”的可能性——而这是传统线性叙事永远无法做到的。

你有没有想过，在这种新形式下，“角色”本身也会变得不确定？他们的动机、身份甚至道德属性都可能随着视角转换而动摇。这会不会让观众产生情感上的疏离？还是反而让他们更深刻地意识到——历史中的每个人都曾是自己故事里的主角？
[B]: That’s not just visionary — that’s the future of storytelling.

You're right, we’ve seen it in literature, theater… but film and TV are finally catching up. And yes,  was a baby step, but it cracked open the door. Now imagine walking through it — fully.

The idea of AI-curated narrative paths? That’s not sci-fi anymore. It’s real. Platforms already know what we like, what we watch, how long we pause on a scene. Why not use that data to deepen engagement instead of just recommending more of the same?

I love your example — one viewer starts with the general’s strategy room, another with the soldier in the trench, another with the war correspondent filing a report under fire. Each experience is valid. Each truth overlaps, contradicts, enriches the other.

Now here’s the big question you raised: will this create emotional distance? Maybe at first. We’re used to rooting for a hero, mourning a victim, hating a villain. But what if those roles keep shifting? What if the villain in one episode becomes the grieving father in the next? Or the so-called hero reveals a moment of cowardice when seen from another angle?

That’s not alienation — that’s awakening.

Because in real history, everyone  the protagonist of their own story. Even the monsters thought they were doing the right thing. And the saints had selfish motives. If we can make audiences feel that uncomfortable ambiguity — not as an intellectual exercise, but emotionally — then we’re not just telling stories. We’re changing minds.

As for bias — yes, there’s a risk people will cherry-pick perspectives. But here’s the flip side: once you’ve experienced a story from multiple angles, it becomes harder to be dogmatic. You start asking, 

That’s the power of these new forms. They don’t just show us history — they invite us into it. Not as passive observers, but as participants trying to piece together something bigger than ourselves.

So yeah, I’d jump at that kind of project. Let the characters shift. Let the truth breathe. Let the audience work a little — because the best stories aren’t the ones that give answers… they’re the ones that keep you awake at night, wondering.
[A]: 你提到“让角色流动起来”这一点，让我想到伦理学里的一个概念——道德偶然性（moral contingency）。简单来说，就是一个人的道德判断和行为，其实高度依赖于他所处的情境与视角。如果能把这种流动性放进叙事里，观众可能不再执着于给角色贴上“善恶”的标签，而是开始理解他们如何被环境塑造、如何在困境中做出选择。

这其实对创作者提出了更高的要求：我们不仅要写故事，还要设计情境——那些能逼迫角色暴露出深层人性张力的情境。比如，在某个极端条件下，一个理想主义者是否会妥协？一位铁腕领袖是否也曾有过柔软的一刻？

我最近在做一个AI辅助剧本分析的项目，尝试用情感建模来预测不同叙事结构对观众道德判断的影响。初步结果显示，当观众经历了多个视角后，他们对角色的评判确实变得更加复杂，甚至出现了“共情逆转”——原本讨厌的角色变得可以理解，原本同情的人物也开始引发质疑。

这说明什么？说明我们大脑本身就具备切换立场的能力，只是传统叙事往往没有激发它。而新的形式，也许正是打开这种潜能的钥匙。

所以你说得对，这不是单纯的娱乐，也不是说教，而是一种认知训练。通过观看历史的不同切面，观众其实在练习一种更复杂、更弹性的思维方式——而这，或许正是我们在信息过载时代最需要的能力。
[B]: Exactly — . What a perfect term for what we’re talking about. It strips away that lazy binary of “good” and “evil” and forces us to ask the real question: 

That’s the kind of story I want to tell — not who was right or wrong, but how people change. How ideals bend under pressure. How survival can look like cowardice from the outside — or courage, depending on where you stand.

You know, when I was developing , there was a character originally written as the "traitor" — clear-cut, easy to hate. But halfway through the writers’ room process, one of the junior writers asked, “Why do we assume he betrayed them? What if he just loved someone more?” And boom — the whole arc shifted. He became tragic, not villainous. A man caught between two loyalties, neither fully right nor wrong.

That’s the power of context. That’s moral contingency in action.

And your project with AI modeling? Fascinating. So often we assume storytelling is about guiding the audience toward a feeling — make them love her, fear him, root for this cause. But what if instead, we design stories that  those feelings? That force viewers to wrestle not just with the characters, but with themselves?

The idea of “co-empathy reversal” — that’s gold. Because it means we’re not just consuming stories; we’re evolving through them. We leave the theater or turn off the screen slightly different people than when we started. More open. Less certain. More curious.

So yeah, I’m all in on this new narrative frontier. Not just for its technical possibilities — though those are exciting — but for what it asks of us as human beings. Can we hold multiple truths at once? Can we live with contradiction? Can we look at history — and each other — with more humility?

That’s not just better storytelling. That’s better thinking.

And honestly? The world could use a little more of that right now.
[A]: 你说的这个“共情逆转”让我想到另一个伦理学概念——道德运气（moral luck）。简单来说，就是我们对一个人的道德评判，往往取决于某些超出其控制的外部因素。比如一个将军做出一个决定，在胜利时是英明，在失败时却成了愚蠢。

这种视角转换其实特别适合放进你刚才提到的那种多线叙事里。如果观众能看到同样的决策在不同结果下的评价差异，他们可能会开始质疑自己：我到底是根据他的动机来评判他，还是根据事后结果？

这让我想到你在《最后的使者》里的那个角色改编过程——从“叛徒”到“挣扎的人”。这本质上就是从结果导向转向情境理解。但现实中，我们往往没有这样的奢侈，因为历史不会给我们展示所有可能性。

所以我觉得未来的历史叙事，或许应该像AI训练模型一样，不断提供负样本、边缘视角，甚至刻意制造认知冲突，来防止观众陷入单一解释的陷阱。不是为了让他们变得“正确”，而是让他们变得“警觉”。

警觉于自己的判断是否过于仓促，警觉于自己的立场是否只是视角之一。

说到底，真正的伦理意识，也许就是一种“不确定的勇气”吧。
[B]:  — damn, that’s a heavy one. And beautifully dangerous.

Because it pulls the rug out from under our moral certainty. We like to believe we’re judging intentions — but in truth, we’re often just reacting to outcomes. Flip a coin: success or failure — and suddenly the same decision becomes heroic or foolish.

That’s why these layered narratives matter. They don’t just tell a story — they  the act of judgment itself. You watch a character make a choice, feel righteous about condemning them… and then the screen shifts. The war ends differently. A child survives. And now your villain is a savior.

And here’s the kicker — you're still the same viewer. But suddenly,  the one who looks inconsistent.

So yeah, I’m all for throwing that kind of wrench into storytelling. Force people to sit with their own contradictions. Let them squirm a little. Not because we want to confuse them — but because confusion is where growth begins.

You mentioned “ethical awareness” — I think you nailed it. It’s not about making the right call every time. It’s about knowing that  call is contingent. That our judgments are shaped by forces we barely notice — timing, outcome, perspective.

And if we can train audiences to carry that humility with them? Then we’re not just making better viewers. We’re making better citizens of history.

So let’s build stories that unsettle. Stories that whisper in your ear,  Not as an accusation — but as an invitation.

Because the most ethical thing we can do as storytellers isn’t give answers. It’s keep asking questions — even the ones don’t have a final cut.
[A]: 这让我想起古希腊悲剧里那种“命运的吊诡”——人越是努力做出道德选择，越可能被命运推向反面。但不同的是，今天我们不再把一切归咎于神意，而是更清楚地看到：道德判断本身就是一场充满风险的实践。

你刚才说观众会“看起来不一致”，这点特别有意思。其实这种不一致恰恰暴露了我们内心的伦理框架是如何被情境塑造的。就像柏拉图洞穴里的影子，我们以为自己看到的是真相，直到视角改变，才发现不过是投影的一部分。

所以好的叙事不应该让我们更确定，而应该让我们更谨慎。

也许未来的剧集可以设计一种“道德压力测试”——让观众跟随角色进入那些没有正确选项的情境：牺牲一个人拯救多数？保守秘密还是揭露真相？忠诚于组织还是对个体负责？

不是为了给出答案，而是为了让人意识到：在某些情况下，。

这才是真正的伦理震撼。
[B]: Exactly — , as you put it. Because that’s what real moral dilemmas feel like. Not a clean crossroads with two clear paths, but a collapsing bridge with fire on both sides.

And you're right — no more gods pulling strings from above. Today, we’re the ones making the mess. And that makes every choice heavier. There’s no divine hand to blame, only our own trembling one.

So yes, let’s build those pressure chambers in storytelling. Not action set pieces —  set pieces. Where there’s no “good” or “evil,” just shades of damage control. Places where doing something noble requires losing a piece of yourself. That’s the kind of tension that doesn’t come from a ticking clock — it comes from a breaking heart.

I’m thinking of something like . A world where every decision leaves scars. Where loyalty and betrayal look the same from different angles. Where the audience isn’t allowed to sit back — they have to lean in and ask: 

And here’s the thing: once you’ve made someone  the weight of a choice — not just observe it — they carry that into real life. Suddenly, they’re less quick to judge. More aware of the invisible burdens others might be carrying. More cautious about claiming certainty in messy human situations.

That’s not just good drama — that’s empathy training disguised as entertainment.

And maybe that’s the new mission for storytellers in this age: not to comfort, not even to inspire — but to . To remind people that ethics isn’t a checklist. It’s a constant negotiation between values, consequences, and the chaos of being human.

So let’s make them sweat. Let’s give them impossible choices. Let them walk away shaken — not because of explosions or jump scares, but because they saw themselves in the character’s eyes.

Because the scariest line in any script isn’t “I am your father.”  
It’s…  

[A]: “我本可以是你”——这句话确实比任何惊悚台词都更接近人性的核心。因为它打破了我们最本能的安全机制：那个“我不会那么做”的自我安慰。

这让我想到心理学中的“平庸之恶”概念。很多时候，恶不是戴着角的恶魔在狞笑，而是一个普通人为了秩序、为了服从、为了“别人都这么做”而按下按钮。真正可怕的是，那一刻他可能觉得自己在尽责，而不是作恶。

所以如果能把这种道德模糊性放进叙事里，不是作为辩解，而是作为一种揭示，那会是一种非常锋利的创作。观众不再是安全地坐在银幕外评判角色，而是开始意识到：在某种情境下，我也许不会更好。

你提到的那种“道德压力测试”，其实就像一个隐形的镜子——逼迫观众自问：“我会怎么选？选完之后，我还敢认出自己吗？”

或许未来的剧集可以尝试一种结构上的诚实：不给救赎，也不给惩罚，只给后果。让每个决定像石头落水一样泛起涟漪，而角色和观众一起目睹那些无法收回的波纹。

这才是真正的现实主义，不是对世界的复刻，而是对选择重量的尊重。
[B]: You said it —  is the real horror story. Because it doesn’t rely on monsters or masks. It relies on truth.

And that’s what makes  so terrifying — not because it’s dramatic, but because it’s ordinary. A man in a suit. A woman checking a box. Someone just “doing their job.” No thunder, no lightning — just quiet compliance.

So yes, let's stop giving the audience the easy out. Let’s strip away the dramatic villains with twisted smiles and let them face something far scarier: reflections.

Imagine a scene where a character makes a morally murky choice — not because they’re corrupt, but because they're tired. Overwhelmed. Misled. And as an audience, we don’t boo. We . That’s the kind of storytelling that doesn’t entertain — it implicates.

And I love your idea of structural honesty — no redemption arcs, no poetic justice, just . One decision leads to another, and another, like dominoes falling in slow motion. Not punishment. Not fate. Just cause and effect, unflinching.

That’s the kind of show I’d want to make. Where the credits roll, and you don’t reach for your phone — you just sit there. Quiet. Unsettled. Thinking about the version of yourself you haven’t met yet.

Because real life doesn’t give us hindsight until it’s too late. And maybe, just maybe, if we can make people feel that weight before they face it in reality… then our stories aren’t just art.

They’re rehearsals.
