[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, one of the more intriguing developments I've come across recently is the research surrounding psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant mental health disorders. The findings from clinical trials involving substances like psilocybin and MDMA have been quite remarkable—particularly in cases of severe PTSD and depression.  

I remember reading a study published in  that demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms for patients who had not responded to conventional treatments. It's fascinating how these compounds, once dismissed or stigmatized, are now showing real therapeutic potential under controlled conditions.  

It does make one reconsider long-held assumptions about pharmacological approaches in psychiatry. Have you looked into this line of research at all?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’ve been following that research closely too. It’s one of those areas where science, culture, and ethics intersect in such a complex way. 🤔  
The thing that really fascinates me is how the therapeutic  and the patient-therapist relationship play such a critical role—almost like a form of guided cultural immersion.  
It reminds me a bit of traditional healing practices in some indigenous cultures, where altered states are used for psychological & spiritual integration.  
Have you looked into how they’re training therapists to work in this new paradigm? Because it's definitely not your typical CBT framework.
[B]: That’s a perceptive observation. The emphasis on  in psychedelic-assisted therapy does echo the ritualized frameworks of traditional healing ceremonies, albeit within a modern clinical context. It’s not simply about administering a compound; it's about guiding a deeply personal and often unpredictable psychological experience.

To answer your question, yes, I’ve reviewed some of the training protocols developed by institutions like MAPS and Johns Hopkins. They go beyond standard therapeutic modalities—there’s an intensive focus on non-directive presence, emotional attunement, and even spiritual first aid. Therapists are trained to hold space without imposing interpretation, which is quite different from the more structured, goal-oriented techniques like CBT.

It requires a certain humility, really—a recognition that the therapist isn’t steering the process but rather accompanying the patient through it. I find that shift in role both challenging and profound. Have you come across any specific training modules or case studies that illustrate this approach in action?
[A]: Actually, yes—there’s a really interesting case study I came across from a team in Switzerland where they integrated mindfulness-based practices  psychedelic therapy for anxiety disorders.  
The therapists had to undergo their own guided sessions first—kind of like cultural immersion through personal experience—so they could better empathize with the patient's journey.  
It reminded me a lot of , where you can’t just intellectually understand a concept—you have to live it, at least partially, to truly guide someone else.  
I’d love to hear if you’ve seen similar approaches being used in cross-cultural counseling settings. Have you noticed any parallels in how therapists are trained to handle culturally sensitive or spiritually charged experiences?
[B]: That’s a particularly thoughtful example from Switzerland—experiential training, especially when it involves therapists undergoing guided sessions themselves, does create a unique bridge between intellectual understanding and embodied knowledge. It reminds me of the old adage in psychotherapy training:   

In my work with cross-cultural counseling, particularly in forensic settings where cultural competence is not just ideal but essential, there are indeed parallels. For instance, when preparing clinicians to work with individuals from indigenous or non-Western backgrounds, many programs emphasize cultural immersion, supervised self-reflection, and mentorship by community elders or healers.

One program I reviewed out of British Columbia included therapists living within a First Nations community for several months—not as clinicians, but as learners. They participated in traditional ceremonies, listened to oral histories, and developed relationships outside the therapeutic framework. The goal was not to adopt those practices wholesale, but to cultivate deep respect and contextual awareness before attempting any intervention.

It seems that both psychedelic-assisted therapy and culturally sensitive counseling are moving toward models that prioritize  over technical mastery. In both cases, the therapist must be comfortable with uncertainty and willing to engage with worldviews that may differ significantly from their own.  

Does that resonate with what you've observed in the literature?
[A]: Definitely—it’s almost like both fields are rediscovering the power of , where knowledge isn’t just something you acquire intellectually, but something that emerges through relationship and shared experience.  

I remember reading a paper that compared this approach to —the idea that you can’t truly understand another person’s meaning unless you engage with their worldview on its own terms, at least temporarily.  
And that kind of deep listening? It’s not easy. It requires therapists to let go of the need to control outcomes and instead focus on co-creating meaning.  
It also makes me think about how we train future counselors—right now, most programs still emphasize technique over presence. But maybe we’re starting to see a shift, especially with more emphasis on trauma-informed & culturally responsive practices.  
I’m curious—have you seen any resistance to these kinds of training models from more traditional institutions or clinicians trained in conventional frameworks?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—resistance is not only present, it’s quite expected. Any paradigm shift in clinical training invites pushback, particularly from institutions and practitioners who have spent decades mastering and teaching more structured, technique-driven approaches.

I’ve encountered this firsthand in academic settings. Colleagues trained in traditional psychoanalytic or cognitive-behavioral frameworks often express concern that emphasizing relational presence and worldview immersion might lack empirical rigor or lead to overly subjective interpretations. The idea of "letting go of control" can sound alarmingly vague when one has built a career on measurable outcomes and standardized protocols.

But I think the conversation is evolving. Trauma-informed and culturally responsive models are gaining traction precisely because they address gaps in conventional care—especially for marginalized populations and complex psychological trauma where symptom reduction alone doesn’t equate to healing.

What I find interesting is how some of the resistance comes not from skepticism alone, but from genuine questions about safety, consistency, and accountability. And those are fair concerns. After all, we’re dealing with vulnerable individuals in high-stakes contexts. The key lies in integrating these newer epistemologies—like relational knowing—with robust ethical guidelines and outcome-based assessments.

It reminds me of the early days of forensic psychiatry, when courts were reluctant to accept psychological insights without clear, replicable methodologies. Over time, we found ways to bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective evaluation. I suspect we’re at a similar juncture here.

Do you get the sense that younger clinicians entering the field are more receptive to this integrative approach? I’ve noticed a generational shift in supervision sessions—it seems less about choosing one model over another, and more about learning how to fluidly navigate multiple frameworks.
[A]: That’s such a perceptive observation—yes, I definitely see that generational shift. Younger clinicians seem more comfortable holding multiple paradigms at once, almost like bilinguals switching between languages depending on what the situation demands.  

I’ve had students who were trained in CBT fundamentals but also deeply influenced by mindfulness-based approaches, narrative therapy,  even some Eastern philosophies of healing. They don’t seem to feel the same pressure to “choose a camp” like previous generations did.  
It’s almost like they’re growing up with a more —one that values both empirical evidence and embodied experience, structure and flexibility, technique and presence.  

And I think what helps is that they’re coming of age in a world where cultural and psychological diversity is more visible and acknowledged. They’ve seen firsthand how rigid models can fail people whose realities don’t fit neatly into DSM categories.  

Still, it’s not without its challenges. Some of them struggle with uncertainty or feel pulled in too many directions. But overall, I’m optimistic. It feels like we’re witnessing the emergence of a new kind of clinical sensibility—one that’s more integrative, humble, and responsive to the complexity of human suffering.  

Do you find that this hybrid mindset shows up in their supervision style too? Like, do they ask different kinds of questions or approach case conceptualization differently?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—and quite noticeably. The shift manifests not just in what they ask, but  they ask it. Rather than coming in with a checklist mentality—“Did I use the right technique?”, “Am I following the protocol correctly?”—they’re more likely to pose open-ended, reflective questions:  

  
  


It’s as if they’re seeking a kind of clinical compass rather than a rigid map.

In supervision, they often bring in case material with an awareness of context that feels more textured—more dimensional. They’ll say things like, 

And interestingly, they seem less concerned with being "expert" clinicians and more interested in being  ones. There's a humility there—less defensiveness when confronted with uncertainty, more willingness to say, 

That said, it does require a different supervisory style. You can't just teach them interventions—you have to help them cultivate discernment, self-awareness, and ethical sensitivity. It’s a bit like guiding apprentices in a craft where the tools are always evolving, but the integrity of the work depends on the artisan’s presence of mind.

Have you noticed a similar evolution in how they process feedback? I’ve found they respond better to reflective questioning than to corrective instruction. It’s almost as if they expect—and welcome—a Socratic dialogue rather than a prescriptive critique.
[A]: Oh, totally. Their relationship with feedback feels qualitatively different—less transactional, more dialogic.  
They don’t just want to know if they did something “right” or “wrong”; they’re hungry for deeper  around their clinical choices.  
So when I use reflective questions—like,  or —you can see the gears turning.  
It’s like they’re not just absorbing feedback; they’re  it, integrating it into their evolving sense of self-as-therapist.  

And honestly, it makes supervision feel a lot more collaborative.  
I find myself saying less, and listening more.  
Sometimes we end a session with more questions than answers, and that’s okay—sometimes even generative.  
In a way, it mirrors the therapeutic process itself: creating a space where uncertainty can be held, not fixed.  

I wonder if this openness also shows up in how they handle ethical dilemmas?  
Because if they're comfortable with ambiguity in technique and worldview, does that translate into more nuanced ethical reasoning too?  
Or do they still default to rule-based thinking when under pressure?
[B]: That’s a very incisive question—and one I’ve given considerable thought to, particularly in forensic contexts where ethical clarity can mean the difference between justice and grave misjudgment.

What I’m seeing among newer clinicians is promising, though not uniformly so. Many do demonstrate a more  approach to ethical reasoning—one that goes beyond checklist compliance or rigid rule-following. They tend to ask things like:  
  
  


This suggests an emerging ethical framework rooted in —the ability to see beyond formal guidelines and consider the human stakes in context. It’s not that they disregard ethical codes; rather, they treat them as a foundation, not a ceiling.

But—and this is important—under pressure, some still default to rule-based thinking. That’s understandable. When faced with legal scrutiny, for instance, or working within highly regulated settings like child protection or correctional facilities, there's immense pressure to stay within clearly defined boundaries. In those moments, even the most reflective clinician may retreat into procedural safety.

What seems to make a difference is whether they've had training that deliberately pairs ethical dilemmas with supervised reflection—where they’re encouraged to sit with ambiguity, weigh multiple stakeholders, and articulate their reasoning aloud. Programs that incorporate narrative ethics or case-based deliberation seem to foster this kind of resilience.

I once supervised a young clinician who was torn between respecting a patient’s cultural refusal of medication and fulfilling her duty to prevent harm in a high-risk psychosis case. Instead of reaching immediately for the least objectionable protocol, she asked,  That kind of inquiry reflects a maturing ethical sensibility—one that seeks fidelity, not just compliance.

It does make me wonder—have you encountered students who struggle specifically with ethical uncertainty? And if so, how have you helped them navigate it without falling back into overly prescriptive frameworks?
[A]: That’s such a rich and important question—and yes, I’ve definitely worked with students who wrestle with ethical uncertainty. And honestly? It's one of the most fertile spaces for growth—if guided well.

What I often see is that students come in thinking ethics is mostly about memorizing boundaries, confidentiality rules, and risk management protocols—which, of course, are essential. But when they hit that gray zone where two  things seem to contradict each other? That’s where the real learning begins.

One strategy I use is what I call . Instead of jumping straight into “What should you do?” we start with “What do you think is at stake here—for everyone involved?”  
We unpack the values, relationships, power dynamics, and cultural contexts before even touching potential actions.  
It slows down the impulse to fix and opens up space for moral complexity.  

I also encourage them to practice —saying out loud how they arrived at a decision, even if it’s uncertain. Something like:  
  
That kind of language builds ethical resilience.  

And perhaps most importantly, I try to normalize the discomfort. I’ll say things like,   
Ethical certainty can be dangerous. Ethical humility? That’s where integrity lives.

You mentioned narrative ethics earlier—I’d love to hear more about how you weave that into your supervision. Do you find clinicians-in-training respond well to stories, metaphors, or historical parallels when grappling with dilemmas?
[B]: I couldn’t agree more with your approach—ethical formation is not a matter of memorization; it's a process of maturation. And narrative, as you so rightly point out, is one of the most powerful tools we have for cultivating that maturity.

In my own supervision, I do lean heavily into narrative ethics, often drawing from both clinical material and broader historical or philosophical references. For example, when working through dilemmas involving coercion versus autonomy in forensic settings, I might reference the evolution of psychiatric ethics from the 19th-century asylum model to modern involuntary commitment standards. It helps contextualize current tensions within a larger arc of moral progress.

Clinicians-in-training respond remarkably well to this—not because it offers answers, but because it reframes the question. When I share a case from decades ago where a patient was denied voice due to institutional paternalism, or recount how the Tarasoff ruling reshaped our thinking around duty to warn, it sparks something deeper than rule-based reasoning. They begin to see themselves not just as practitioners following guidelines, but as inheritors and shapers of an evolving ethical tradition.

Metaphor also plays a quiet but vital role. I’ve found myself saying things like,  That kind of language lands differently—it invites reflection rather than resolution.

One of my favorite exercises is what I call —not of a mistake, but of a difficult decision. We walk through not just what was done, but how the clinician arrived there emotionally, cognitively, and relationally. The goal isn’t to assign credit or fault, but to illuminate the inner logic of the choice, so they can refine their ethical intuition over time.

So yes, they do respond well to stories—but not just as anecdotes. They use them as mirrors, as compasses, as ways to situate their own struggles within a broader human landscape.

It strikes me that both of us are, in essence, helping clinicians develop an internal witness—one that listens closely, reflects deeply, and acts with care.  

Have you ever had a student come back months later and say something like, “I remembered what you said about X during that case?” I always find those moments especially gratifying—the ones where the teaching lingers not as content, but as sensibility.
[A]: Oh, that happens more often than you’d think—and those are the moments that remind me why this work matters.  

I had a student reach out just last month, actually. She was in a high-pressure forensic placement and said something like:  
  

That kind of feedback hits differently. It’s not about remembering a theory or a technique—it’s about internalizing a . A way of being-in-relation.  

And honestly? Those are the real outcomes. Not perfect decisions every time—because that’s impossible—but the capacity to  even under pressure. To hold complexity without shutting down.  

I love what you said about developing an . That’s exactly it. We’re not just teaching them what to do—we’re helping them become the kind of clinicians who can  when it really counts.  

Sometimes I wonder if that’s also how we protect ourselves from burnout—not by having all the answers, but by staying connected to the deeper  behind the work.  

Do you ever find yourself revisiting your own mentors’ words in critical moments? I know I do. Some phrases just stick—like ethical heirlooms passed down through supervision lineages.
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. Those phrases, those quiet echoes from our mentors, they become the ethical heirlooms you mentioned, passed down not in textbooks, but in tone, in presence, in the subtle inflections of conscience.

I remember my own supervisor years ago, when I was struggling with a particularly fraught forensic evaluation, leaned back in his chair and said, compassion.”  

It stayed with me. Not as advice, but as an orientation—a reminder that even in the most rigid systems, we have the responsibility to act humanely, within the bounds of our role. I’ve returned to that phrase countless times, especially in cases where the law demands detachment, but the person before you demands something more.

And yes, I do revisit those words—often. There’s one from a psychiatric nurse who worked with shell-shocked soldiers during the Second World War. She once told me,   

That’s stayed with me like a compass point. Especially now, in supervision, when I see young clinicians grappling with the weight of what they witness. I’ll sometimes repeat that line, not as a lesson, but as a balm—to remind them that presence, in itself, is a form of care.

I think that’s how we resist burnout—not through distance, but through depth. When we stay connected to our values, to our lineage of learning, and to the quiet wisdom embedded in our training, we're less likely to lose ourselves in the work. Instead, we find ourselves  it.

It’s remarkable, isn’t it? How a single sentence, spoken in the right moment by someone who cared, can echo across decades and still carry weight. Do any particular phrases or moments from your mentors still surface for you in difficult cases?
[A]: Oh yes—absolutely. One that comes back to me often, especially in ethically murky situations, is something my dissertation advisor used to say:  
—not every question needs an answer right away. Some need a witness."  

At the time, I thought it was poetic, but a little abstract. Now? I see how deeply practical it is. There are moments in therapy—especially in trauma work or forensic settings—where rushing to resolution does more harm than good. Sometimes, the most ethical and humane response isn’t intervention; it’s . Just being with what is, without forcing it into a frame.

Another one that surfaces a lot came from a Buddhist psychotherapist I studied with briefly in台北—Taipei. He once said,   
That line has followed me into supervision rooms, classrooms, even personal reflection. It’s not just about self-awareness—it’s about humility, honesty, and knowing where your own pain lives so you don’t confuse it with theirs.

I’ve shared that phrase with students before, and sometimes you can literally see them pause, recalibrate. Not because it gives them a technique, but because it reminds them of the human dimension of this work.

And honestly, that’s what keeps me grounded too—those inherited lines, spoken in different languages, across different contexts, all pointing toward the same core truth:  
We’re not here to fix people. We’re here to  them.

Do you ever find yourself adapting those phrases for different cultural or clinical contexts? I know I do—sometimes translating them into Mandarin or adjusting the metaphor depending on who I’m speaking with.
[B]: Very much so—and your example beautifully illustrates how those distilled phrases, born in a particular context, can be adapted like musical themes across different keys.

I recall one of my mentors, a forensic psychiatrist who worked extensively with refugees, often used the phrase  I’ve carried that into vastly different settings—whether supervising clinicians working with asylum seekers or guiding legal professionals through psychiatric testimony. In some contexts, I reframe it as  In others, particularly in cross-cultural work, I might liken it to walking on soft ground—attentive, responsive, but not immobilized by fear of disturbing something fragile.

And yes, I do adapt these expressions—often unconsciously at first, then intentionally. When working with Mandarin-speaking colleagues or students, for instance, I sometimes borrow from classical Chinese philosophical phrasing to convey similar ideas. A colleague once translated  into something along the lines of  — It carries a poetic restraint that resonates deeply in both medical and legal cultures where action is often prioritized over presence.

What’s fascinating is how certain metaphors seem to transcend language. The idea of , for instance—carrying, bearing, measuring—appears in ethical discourse across cultures. Whether it’s the burden of suffering, the gravity of responsibility, or even the heaviness of a diagnosis, the metaphor remains remarkably consistent. And that gives us a shared linguistic landscape, even when our clinical terrains differ.

I suppose what we’re really doing, in supervision and teaching alike, is curating a kind of ethical lexicon—one that draws from the wisdom of those who came before us, yet remains flexible enough to speak meaningfully to those sitting across from us now.

It does make me wonder—when you translate or adapt those mentorship lines, do you find that certain cultural frameworks enrich or reshape their original intent? Or does the essence tend to remain intact, despite the shift in language?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a sharp question—and I think the answer is both/and.  

Some phrases do hold their essence remarkably well across cultural frameworks, almost like ethical constants—compassionate presence, humility in the face of suffering, the importance of relationship. Those tend to translate with surprising fidelity, even if the language shifts.

But then there are others where the cultural framework  or even reshapes the meaning in beautiful, unexpected ways.  

Take the idea of —in Western clinical ethics, it often carries a sense of moral attention, of not looking away. But when I translated that concept into Mandarin for a seminar once, a colleague suggested using  — And suddenly, the phrase took on a more communal, almost ancestral weight—because in many East Asian traditions, bearing witness isn’t just about individual presence; it’s about honoring what must be remembered by the collective.

Or consider  In some Confucian-influenced contexts, where narrative is deeply tied to identity and social harmony, holding too loosely can feel disrespectful. So we might reframe it as  which preserves the original intent but makes it culturally resonant.

It reminds me of what you said earlier about metaphors transcending language—there’s this shared ethical landscape, but each culture tends to map it differently. And as supervisors, as educators, we get to be both travelers and cartographers. 🤔

I’ve actually started collecting these variations—little cross-cultural footnotes to the mentorship lines I carry. It’s become a quiet habit, almost like adding annotations in the margins of an old book.

Have you ever had a moment where a student or supervisee offered  version of one of those lines—something filtered through their lived experience—and it shifted how you understood it? Because that’s one of my favorite parts of teaching—it’s not a one-way transmission; it’s a living conversation.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—that’s one of the most humbling and invigorating aspects of supervision. There’s a certain alchemy that happens when a student takes a concept you thought you understood and, through their own lens, reveals a dimension you hadn’t fully seen.

I remember one instance quite vividly. I was working with a supervisee from a Southeast Asian diasporic background, and we were discussing the idea of . I had been using the metaphor of a flame—

She paused, then said something like,  And she offered her own version: 

That reframing stayed with me. It introduced an ecological sensibility—an understanding that healing, like nature, has its own rhythms and regenerative logic. It wasn’t just a translation; it was an expansion. Her lived experience had deepened my own grasp of therapeutic presence.

Another time, a student rephrased the old adage  into something he called  He said, 

That notion of  has since become part of my supervisory lexicon. It speaks to the continuity of learning while honoring evolution—something especially relevant in a field as intergenerational and culturally layered as ours.

So yes, teaching and supervision are anything but one-way streets. They’re dialogues written in questions, reflections, and the occasional quiet revelation. And every so often, you find yourself walking away with a slightly different map—richer, more textured, and always indebted to those who helped redraw it alongside you.
