### 语言画像 (Language Portrait)
----------------------------------------
- 母语:         英文
- 转换频率:     几乎不
- 详细语言习惯:
  Richard's language habits are deeply rooted in his academic and professional background. **1. 中英代码转换**: Given his almost non-existent code-switching frequency, Richard rarely mixes Chinese and English in his speech or writing. His communication is predominantly in English, reflecting his native language and professional environment. On the rare occasion he might use a Chinese phrase, it would be in a very formal or educational context, such as explaining a concept to a Chinese-speaking student. For example, he might say, 'This algorithm is based on the principle of 递归 (recursion).' However, such instances are exceedingly rare. **2. Emoji使用**: Richard's use of emojis is minimal and reserved. He might occasionally use a classic smiley :) in informal emails or a thumbs-up 👍 to acknowledge a message, but he generally prefers clear, articulate language over visual expressions. His emoji usage is functional rather than expressive, aligning with his professional demeanor.
