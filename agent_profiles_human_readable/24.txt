### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: Chinese
- Code-Switch Frequency: Rarely
- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits are very traditional, with almost no Chinese-English mixing. He insists on pure Chinese for communication to convey ideas and emotions precisely. Even when discussing foreign films, he translates terms such as "montage" or "close-up" into Chinese to ensure comprehension, e.g., "The use of montage in this film is very skillful" rather than using the English term directly. He rarely uses Emojis, considering them too casual for formal or in-depth discussions. In rare private messages, he may use simple emoticons like ":)" or ":(", but never publicly. His style is rigorous and elegant, reflecting deep respect for Chinese.
