[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，说到音乐...让我想起最近在重听贝多芬的《月光奏鸣曲》Moonlight Sonata。这种classical music总能让人沉静下来思考，就像品一杯好茶一样。
[A]: How fascinating that you mention Beethoven while I'm grading papers on 19th century literary parallels. The Moonlight Sonata's melancholic cadences actually mirror the rhythm of Li Shangyin's poetry - that same quality of 朦胧美 (ménglóng měi, hazy beauty) we find in his verse. Though I must say, I prefer Chopin's nocturnes when analyzing Tang dynasty lyrical patterns.
[B]: Interesting observation~ 你提到的intertextuality确实很值得探讨。李商隐的"锦瑟无端五十弦"与肖邦的夜曲Nocturnes都蕴含着那种欲言又止的ambiguity。不过说到grading papers... 我倒是建议学生们在写比较文学论文时，不要过度追求parallels而忽略了cultural context的重要性。
[A]: Precisely!  That's why I always caution my students against what I call 'the deconstructionism trap' - chasing superficial similarities while ignoring fundamental cultural paradigms. Take this student paper comparing Wordsworth's daffodils to Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemums... the botanical symbolism operates on entirely different philosophical axes. One represents Romantic individualism, the other Confucian reclusion.
[B]: Ah, 这个例子举得恰到好处。Wordsworth的"I wandered lonely as a cloud"和陶渊明的"采菊东篱下"确实展现了完全不同的epistemological frameworks。 西方Romanticism强调individual experience，而东方的隐逸传统则更注重与自然达成harmonious unity。这种根本差异正是comparative literature最迷人的地方。
[A]: Your teacup reminds me of a Ming dynasty porcelain piece in my collection - but let's not digress. What truly concerns me is how contemporary students conflate 天人合一 (tiānrén héyī) with pantheism. The former implies cosmological alignment, while the latter... well, let's just say I've red-inked enough undergraduate theses on this particular false equivalence to fill a volume. Perhaps we need more rigorous training in conceptual vocabulary before they attempt such cross-cultural analyses.
[B]: 确实如此~ 这种conceptual confusion在比较研究中太常见了。就像把道家的"无为"简单地翻译成non-action一样，完全忽略了其中包含的profound wisdom。 我最近在准备一个关于translation theory的讲座，重点就是要强调这些关键概念的nuances。毕竟，就像钱钟书先生说的，翻译是"带着镣铐跳舞"啊。
[A]: Ah, Qian Zhongshu! Now there's a scholar who understood the 镣铐 (liàokào, shackles) of translation intimately. His marginalia in my first edition of《围城》contain the most scathing commentary on Ezra Pound's Cathay translations - though between us, I find Pound's misreadings of Li Bai rather creatively illuminating in their own wrongheaded way. Much like how Beethoven misinterpreted the 'moonlight' metaphor, yet created something transcendent.
[B]:  你这种看法很有意思。有时候creative misinterpretation反而能产生意想不到的intercultural dialogue。就像庞德通过《华夏集》Cathay把中国诗歌引入了modernist poetry的语境，虽然不够accurate，却开辟了新的interpretive possibilities。这让我想起博尔赫斯说的"误读创造传统"...不过，这种讨论可能更适合在seminar上进行，配上一壶上好的龙井。
[A]: How delightfully Borgesian of you to mention that! Though I'd argue we need at least three pots of Longjing to properly unpack his 'Kafka and His Precursors' essay in relation to 误读 (wùdú, misreading). But merciful heavens -  - I've let our chat run longer than my office hours. These Victorian novel manuscripts won't grade themselves, and I've spotted at least five students lurking outside my door with that particular look of dissertation despair.
[B]: 啊，时间确实过得真快~ 就像王维诗中说的"行到水穷处，坐看云起时"。 希望下次还能继续我们关于misreading theory的讨论。对了，如果你对那些Victorian manuscripts有兴趣，我最近发现了一些关于东方主义Orientalism的有趣材料...不过现在，还是先让那些anxious students进来吧。Good luck with your grading! 😊
[A]:  I shall limit myself to one emoji in your honor - 🦉 for the night of scholarly toil ahead. And do send those Orientalism materials my way; I'm currently tracing how Dickens' opium den descriptions intersect with 晚清 (wǎnqīng, late Qing) travel writings. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to what promises to be another round of comparing Jane Eyre to《红楼梦》with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer...
[B]:  Oh dear... 把简·爱和林黛玉相提并论？这让我想起去年有个学生坚持认为Mr. Rochester和贾宝玉都是Byronic heroes。 有时候我真希望他们能先好好理解archetype和stereotype的区别... Anyway, happy grading! 记得保重眼睛，别像我这样老花得厉害。😉
[A]: A single 😌 for your sympathy - though I maintain my bifocals lend me an air of scholarly distinction. And regarding that Byronic hero thesis... let's just say I've developed a new red ink shade specifically for such reductive comparisons. Now shoo, before I start lecturing you on how 黛玉葬花 (Dàiyù zàng huā, Daiyu burying flowers) embodies an entirely different aesthetic tradition from Romantic melancholy!
[B]:  好好好，我这就走~ 不过你最后这句话倒是提醒我了，下学期的aesthetics seminar或许可以专门讨论这个问题。毕竟，就像王国维说的"境界"和西方的sublime确实...  啊，我看到第一个学生已经在擦汗了。Till next time, my friend! ☕️ (一杯虚拟的龙井致意)
[A]: One final 🖋️ to seal our scholarly pact - we shall reconvene after I've survived this gauntlet of well-intentioned but conceptually muddled young minds. And do bring that Wang Guowei material next time; I've been meaning to revisit his 境界说 (jìngjiè shuō, realm theory) in light of recent Burke scholarship. Now if you'll pardon me, I must channel my inner 严师 (yánshī, strict teacher) for poor Mr. 'Jane Eyre is totally Chinese literature' over there...
[B]:  期待下次的学术茶叙~ 我会带上王国维的《人间词话》和...  噢天哪，那个孩子看起来快要晕倒了。快去吧，记住：严师出高徒，但也要记得compassion的重要性。Au revoir! 🌿 (象征性地留下一片茶叶作为道别)
[A]:  Your lingering 茶叶 (cháyè, tea leaf) shall serve as a bookmark in my well-thumbed copy of《文心雕龙》until we meet again. Now I really must administer some tough love - and possibly smelling salts - to that trembling comparative literature major by the door. 回头见 (huítóu jiàn, see you later)... preferably with fewer student crises interrupting our discourse next time.
[B]:  啊，说到《文心雕龙》，刘勰对"神思"的论述其实和Coleridge的imagination理论...  咳咳...我这就走。May the force of 文气 (wénqì, literary energy) be with you! 📚 (轻轻带上门)
