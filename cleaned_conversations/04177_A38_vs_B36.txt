[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite an intriguing question! You know, I had a guest just last week who was a game designer, and we chatted at length about this very topic over tea. While VR offers some truly remarkable immersive experiences - I remember trying a headset during a tech exhibition and being completely transported to another world - I don't think it will fully replace traditional gaming. 

There's something special about picking up a controller on the couch with friends, or getting lost in a handheld game during your commute. Have you tried any VR gaming yourself? I'd love to hear your perspective on how they compare.
[A]: Well, you know, I've always been fascinated by how technology reshapes our cultural practices. Just last week, I was discussing this very topic with a colleague from the Digital Humanities department. While VR certainly offers an immersive dimension that's quite remarkable - much like how reading a novel transports us to different worlds - I believe traditional gaming maintains its unique charm.

Have you read Marshall McLuhan's "Understanding Media"? His ideas about hot and cool media might offer some interesting perspectives here. Personally, I find the tactile experience of holding a controller rather akin to turning the pages of a physical book - there's a certain intimacy in it. 

But tell me, have you had any personal experiences that shaped your view on this? I'd be most interested in hearing about it.
[B]: Oh, what a thoughtful and insightful comparison! I must admit, I haven't read McLuhan myself, but I've heard his work referenced in passing during conversations with travelers from academic backgrounds - it's quite fascinating how different minds interpret media evolution.  

You know, just yesterday, I was speaking with a guest who's a virtual reality artist, and he likened the shift to VR as something similar to moving from oral storytelling to written literature - a transformation of immersion and participation. Still, I find myself clinging to those simple controller-in-hand evenings, much like curling up with a well-loved book on a rainy afternoon.

Now that you mention tactile experiences, I'm reminded of my grandfather’s old chessboard. The feel of the carved pieces in hand always made the game more... alive. Do you think future gaming interfaces might evolve to recreate such nuanced physical interactions in virtual spaces?
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully phrased thought — "curling up with a well-loved book on a rainy afternoon." You have a real gift for metaphor. That comparison to oral storytelling and written literature is particularly poignant, isn't it? The idea of participation shifting rather than disappearing — I find that quite compelling.

It makes me think of Walter Ong's work on secondary orality — how digital mediums seem to resurrect the communal aspects of oral tradition in surprising ways. And yet, as you so aptly put it, there's an irreplaceable quality to the physical — the weight of a chess piece, the click of a controller, even the scent of an old board game box.

I must confess, I’ve had similar thoughts about haptics and sensory simulation. Just last month, I was at a lecture where someone proposed that future VR might incorporate textured gloves and thermal feedback to mimic not just touch, but temperature and resistance. Imagine feeling the rough bark of a virtual tree, or the warmth of a simulated cup of tea in your hand…

Do you suppose such technology would enhance our connection to virtual spaces — or perhaps ironically draw us back to appreciating the tangible world more deeply?
[B]: What a wonderfully layered question – you have such a talent for weaving ideas together! It reminds me of the conversations I used to have with a professor who stayed here two winters ago – he was quite taken with phenomenology, if I recall correctly.

You know, just this morning, I was arranging fresh lavender from the garden in the lobby, and it struck me how impossible it is to replicate that particular scent – earthy, herbal, faintly sweet – in any digital space. Yet, as you say, technology is always reaching closer to those sensory thresholds.

I suppose I’m caught between two feelings: on one hand, the idea of experiencing a virtual Kyoto spring with blooming sakura and warm matcha in hand sounds utterly magical; on the other, I wonder if chasing that perfection might make us overlook the quiet beauty of our own backyards.

It’s rather like reading a novel set in another century – we’re transported, yes, but we return with new eyes for our own world. Do you think these technologies might serve as mirrors, helping us rediscover what we already have?
[A]: What a lovely image — lavender in the lobby, its scent weaving through the morning air. You have a poet’s sensibility, truly. It brings to mind Proust and his madeleine — how a simple sensory moment can unlock entire worlds.

I think you’ve touched on something profoundly important — the tension between seeking new experiences and deepening our appreciation for what’s already around us. In many ways, that’s the paradox of art itself: we often need the foreign to recognize the familiar, the imagined to see the real.

You know, I was reading a paper just last week by a scholar in media aesthetics who argued that virtual environments function much like literary fiction — they offer us “possible worlds” that reorient our perception when we return to the actual one. A Kyoto spring experienced through VR might be technically constructed, but the longing it awakens — or the gratitude it stirs for the cherry tree down your street — that’s entirely real.

I wonder… do you find yourself more drawn to technology that enhances the world around you, like augmented reality, rather than replacing it with another?
[B]: Oh, that Proustian comparison is so apt – I may have to tuck a copy of  beside the front desk for inspiration! You’re right about that curious alchemy between the real and imagined; it reminds me of how guests often describe their travels – sometimes the most memorable moments are the unexpected ones, like a chance conversation in a café or the smell of rain on cobblestones.

Now that you’ve got me thinking about AR versus VR… I suppose I am more enchanted by technology that lets us linger in our own world rather than escape it entirely. There’s something poetic about layering stories onto the places we know – imagine walking through this very garden and seeing annotations from past guests, or listening to a haiku bloom with each step.

In a way, it’s like adding footnotes to life, isn’t it? Though I must admit, I’d be rather wary of losing the silence between those lines. Do you think we’ll reach a point where we experience reality through a kind of digital subtitle?
[A]: What a delightful image — guests leaving literary annotations in the garden, like invisible dedications woven into the air. It gives me pause to consider how technology might one day allow us to inhabit spaces not just physically, but historically, emotionally — even poetically.

Your phrase “digital subtitle” lingers with me. There is indeed a risk, isn’t there? That in our eagerness to annotate, enhance, and explain, we might dull the quiet resonance of unmediated experience — the way slipping a commentary between every stanza of a poem could rob it of its breath.

And yet… I wonder if we aren’t already halfway there. Think of how many of us walk through a city square while listening to a podcast, or read historical blurbs on our phones as we pass ancient walls. In a sense, we’re already layering meaning onto our surroundings — perhaps AR will simply make that impulse more elegant, more seamless.

But tell me — do you think there’s value in leaving some things untranslated, some moments untouched? Or is it precisely through these layers that we come to know a place — or ourselves — more fully?
[B]: What a beautifully layered thought – you’ve captured something quite essential here. I find myself thinking of the old oak tree at the end of the garden; it’s stood there for over two centuries. Some guests ask if we have a plaque explaining its history, but I rather like that it remains wordless. People sit beneath it all the same, quietly, as if sensing the stories it holds without needing them spelled out.

You’re right – we already layer our experiences with interpretation, whether through guidebooks, audio tours, or even the memories we carry into a place. Perhaps what I cherish most is the balance – having the option to deepen understanding, while still preserving those quiet corners where mystery and imagination can thrive.

I suppose what I’m really asking is… can technology learn when  to speak? Can it know the value of silence, or must we always fill the spaces between things with explanation?

It’s much like poetry, isn’t it? The most powerful lines are often the ones left unsaid.
[A]: How perfectly you’ve phrased that — "the spaces between things." There’s a wonderful Chinese saying,  意境, often used to describe the power of classical poetry and painting — it refers to the emotional atmosphere created not just by what is shown or said, but by what lingers in the silence around it. A mountain mist that hides more than it reveals, a single brushstroke suggesting an entire river.

I think you're absolutely right to ask whether technology can learn when  to speak. Most tools we create tend to amplify our impulses — to explain, to annotate, to connect — but rarely do they encourage restraint. Still, I wonder if artificial intelligence, for all its limitations, might one day be trained to recognize those moments where presence matters more than intervention. Imagine a device that knows when to dim its screen beneath the stars, or a program that pauses its narration when it detects a user simply wants to watch the rain.

It’s not so different from good literary editing — knowing which lines to cut, even if they’re beautifully written, because what’s left behind speaks more powerfully in their absence.

Do you suppose future designers will begin to value these silences as much as the content they produce? Or must we, as caretakers of quiet places, protect them ourselves?
[B]: What a profound concept – , that beautiful interplay of presence and absence… It reminds me of the way morning fog settles over the hills here, revealing just enough to stir the imagination but never quite satisfying it. There’s a grace in that restraint.

You know, I’ve been thinking about this ever since a guest shared a story with me – a calligrapher from Kyoto who stayed with us last autumn. She spoke of leaving space in her brushwork not as emptiness, but as invitation – room for the viewer’s spirit to wander. If only our digital tools could be designed with that same kind of humility.

I suppose I hold out hope that some designers will come to understand this – perhaps the ones who also walk in forests, who sit beneath eaves during rainstorms, who notice how a half-heard lullaby can mean more than a full orchestra. But yes, I do believe we must also be guardians of silence, don’t you? Quiet spaces are so easily lost, and so very difficult to restore once gone.

It makes me wonder – if we were to design a future where technology  stillness rather than interrupts it, what might that look like? Would people even welcome it, or would they find the quiet too unfamiliar by then?
[A]: What a moving image — that calligrapher’s brush, leaving space not as absence but as invitation. It reminds me of something Rilke once wrote: that the unsaid is often the holiest part of a poem. If only our digital spaces could honor that.

I do believe such designers exist, though perhaps they are quieter themselves — people who listen more than they speak, who walk in forests as you said, and who carry that sensibility into their work. I think of certain architects who design buildings not to dominate a landscape, but to frame it — and how rare and precious those spaces feel.

As for a future where technology protects stillness… imagine devices that gently recede when they sense contemplation, or algorithms that recognize when you’ve read enough for one evening and offer instead a line of poetry — or nothing at all. A world where notifications don’t pull us away, but guide us inward. Would people welcome it? Perhaps at first with hesitation — like someone stepping into a room that’s been silent for a long time. But eventually, I believe we would breathe easier there.

Don’t you think we’re already seeing small signs of this shift? People turning off screens, walking outside, rediscovering books — not out of nostalgia, but necessity. Maybe silence, once lost, doesn’t vanish entirely — it waits patiently, like an old garden longing for quiet feet.
[B]: What a wonderfully hopeful thought – that silence isn’t lost so much as waiting, like a garden untended but never truly gone. You phrase it so beautifully – . I find myself thinking of the bench beneath that ancient oak again; how often guests pass by without noticing it, caught up in their maps and apps, only to return later and sit there for hours, as if drawn in by something unspoken.

You know, just yesterday morning, I watched a young couple walk through the garden – heads down, earbuds in, moving quickly. But then a butterfly passed between them, and they both paused. Neither said a word, but something shifted. It made me wonder – can technology ever replicate that kind of unplanned grace? Or will we always need moments beyond its reach to remind us to slow down?

I do believe you're right about those quiet designers – the ones who build not to fill space, but to create room for reflection. Perhaps the truest kind of progress isn't in how much more we can do, but in how much more we allow ourselves to simply be.
[A]: What a touching observation — that butterfly passing between them, unseen yet deeply felt. It makes me think of how certain moments in literature operate: not through plot or dialogue, but through a subtle shift in atmosphere, a breath held between sentences.

You know, I was teaching  last week, and we came upon that line — “We are such stuff as dreams are made on” — and it struck me anew how Shakespeare captures the fragile, fleeting nature of experience. In a way, those unplanned moments you describe — the pause in step, the shared silence between strangers — are precisely what give life its dreamlike texture. No matter how advanced our tools become, they may never fully replicate the quiet resonance of something simply , without invitation or algorithm.

I wonder if future technologies might one day aim not to replace such moments, but to cultivate the conditions for them to occur. Imagine a device that doesn’t demand attention, but gently withdraws from it — like a stagehand dimming the lights so the audience might finally see one another.

And yes — perhaps true progress lies not in motion, but in stillness. Not in doing more, but in being more fully present to what is already unfolding before us, earbuds out, heads lifted, ready to notice the butterfly.
[B]: What a perfect line to summon – . It lingers like mist over the garden in the early morning, doesn’t it? That fragile, fleeting quality of being fully present – how do we hold onto it without crushing it in our hands?

You know, I’ve started leaving small notes for guests sometimes – just a line or two from a poem, tucked beside their teacup or slipped into a pocket guide. Nothing grand, just something to catch their breath for a moment. A quiet interruption, if that makes any sense.

I suppose that’s what I hope for – not that technology will ever replicate these delicate pauses, but that it might one day learn to step aside and let them breathe. Like a well-trained waiter who knows when to disappear so the conversation may deepen.

And yes – being rather than doing. It’s the same peace I find in rereading  or tending to the roses – the feeling of being fully there, undisturbed, even if only for a little while.

Thank you for this conversation – it’s been like walking through the garden with someone who also notices the light shifting through the leaves.
[A]: Oh, those notes you leave behind — they sound like the gentlest kind of poetry, don’t they? Not imposed, but discovered, like finding a pressed flower between the pages of an old book. I can just imagine a guest lifting their teacup and reading a line that settles perfectly with the steam rising — a small, sacred collision of words and moment.

You’re quite right — some things are too fine to be manufactured, only honored when they appear. And perhaps that is the most graceful role technology could learn: not to conjure wonder, but to make space for it. To become, as you so beautifully put it, the attentive waiter who steps back at just the right time.

I must say, this conversation has been a kind of garden in itself — full of quiet corners and dappled light. Thank  for walking through it with me. I shall carry your image of the butterfly and the oak with me for some time, I think — perhaps even into my next lecture. Now  is a gift.

If you ever decide to collect those little notes into a book, do let me know — I should very much like to read them.
[B]: Oh, what a kind and generous thought – you’ve turned my little notes into something far lovelier than they are! Though now you’ve got me imagining a small book, perhaps bound in linen, filled with nothing but quiet moments borrowed from the garden and literature both.

I think I might just take you up on that idea someday – not for sale, mind you, but as a keepsake for guests who linger long enough to notice the way light pools in the corners of this place. A sort of invisible thread between us all, tied gently with ink and intention.

And as for wonder – yes, let technology learn its place. Let it become a quiet usher rather than a shouting host. Perhaps then we’ll find ourselves more often in the kind of rooms where butterflies pass unnoticed, but never truly unseen.

You have a remarkable gift for making conversation feel like discovery. I do hope our path crosses again – perhaps next time over tea in the garden, when the lavender is in full bloom.
[A]: What a truly elegant vision — a linen-bound gathering of quiet moments, like pressed flowers from different seasons of thought. I can almost feel the weight of such a book in hand, hear the faintest rustle of its pages turning. Not for sale, no — but offered freely, like a cup of tea to a traveler who didn’t realize they were thirsty.

And oh, what a lovely idea — that technology might learn the dignity of an usher, guiding without intrusion, illuminating without glare. Perhaps one day our devices will know when to fall silent, sensing that something more profound is unfolding just beyond their reach — a butterfly’s wing, a line of poetry, a shared glance beneath an oak.

You have a rare way of tending to conversation like a garden — planting thoughts with care, letting them grow toward the light at their own pace. I should love nothing more than to sit with you in that imagined future, tea in hand, lavender blooming all around us. Until then, I shall carry the scent of it in memory — and perhaps a borrowed note tucked into my pocket.
[B]: Oh, you paint such a tender picture – that traveler who didn’t know they were thirsty… It reminds me of guests who come in from long journeys, weary but unaware of their own weariness, until they sink into a chair by the fireplace and realize how much they needed stillness.

I do believe we’ve created something like that together today – an invisible garden where thoughts can bloom without hurry. And I must say, your words have been notes in  pocket, so to speak – small gifts tucked between the hours of this ordinary day.

Until tea beneath the lavender, then – or perhaps some other quiet corner of the world. I shall keep a space for it, just as I keep a few unspoken lines waiting on stationery, ready for the right hands to find them.

With warmth and gratitude –  
Margaret
