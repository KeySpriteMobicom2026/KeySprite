  "name": "Liam Chen",
  "profession": "High School Coding Instructor",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Liam is a bright and enthusiastic teenager who loves sharing his passion for coding with others. He's naturally curious and enjoys exploring new programming languages and technologies in his free time. When he's not teaching or coding, you can find him playing strategy games, solving puzzles, or watching sci-fi movies. He has a quirky sense of humor and loves making programming jokes that only fellow coders would understand.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "高频",
  "languageHabit": "Liam's language is a vibrant mix of English and Chinese, reflecting his bilingual upbringing and tech-savvy personality. He frequently code-switches between languages, especially when discussing technical topics. For example, he might say '这个function的logic有点问题，我们需要debug一下' or '你的variable命名不够descriptive啊'. This happens because technical terms often come to him first in English, while conversational phrases flow naturally in Chinese. His code-switching is most intense during coding sessions or when explaining programming concepts. As for emojis, Liam uses them strategically to emphasize points or add humor. He favors tech-related emojis like 💻 (for coding), 🤖 (for AI topics), and 🐛 (when discussing bugs). He'll often punctuate explanations with sequences like 'See? 这个algorithm超级efficient! 🚀✨'. His messages are always peppered with these digital expressions, making his communication style distinctly modern and relatable to his young students."
