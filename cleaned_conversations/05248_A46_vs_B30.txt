[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... You know, I've always found that question rather like asking whether one prefers prose or poetry - they're simply different modes of experience. Though I must admit a certain fondness for savory flavors, particularly when paired with the right tea. A good Wuyi oolong with some lapsang souchong notes can make a perfectly balanced savory dish absolutely sing. 

But don't mistake that for disdain for sweetness - I've developed quite a taste for 桂花糕 (guìhuā gāo) from my time studying in Hangzhou. The osmanthus flowers give it this delicate fragrance that's utterly transporting. Still, I find myself reaching more often for those complex umami flavors, much like how I tend to reread Wuthering Heights rather than Pride and Prejudice.
[A]: Ah, you've touched on something deeply poetic here. I find that savory flavors often carry a certain narrative depth, wouldn't you agree? They unfold like a well-structured three-act play - the initial note, the developing complexity, and that lingering finish that stays with you long after the credits roll. 

Funny you should mention umami - that's precisely why I love working late into the night with a plate of aged Parmesan and a glass of Pinot Noir. There's something about that concentrated savoriness that sharpens the creative mind, like seasoning for inspiration. Though I must say, there's nothing quite like coming home to my wife's homemade chicken adobo after a long day on set. The way the garlic and vinegar marry together... it's filmmaking in edible form. 

But tell me, have you ever noticed how certain flavors transport us back to specific moments? For me, a bite of bitter melon stir-fry instantly takes me to my first film festival in Busan.
[B]: Ah yes, that wonderful interplay between taste and memory - much like how Proust's madeleine works, but with a touch more umami. I find the progression of savory flavors particularly compelling because they mirror literary structure so beautifully. Take a well-aged balsamic reduction - it's essentially a narrative arc in liquid form, wouldn't you agree? 

Now you've got me reminiscing about my first fieldwork in Suzhou. The first time I tasted 松鼠鱖魚 (sōngshǔ guìyú), that crispy sweet-and-sour Mandarin fish... The texture contrast alone could make one reconsider Flaubert's theories on sensory realism. Though I must confess, nothing quite compares to the intellectual clarity that comes with a midnight snack of fermented tofu on rice crackers while grading papers. 

And yes, those transportive qualities! For me it's always that particular brand of Sichuan preserved mustard tuber - every bite takes me straight back to the archives in Chengdu where I first uncovered those fascinating parallels between Brontë's storm metaphors and Qing dynasty landscape poetry.
[A]: Ah, you've articulated it perfectly - that intellectual seduction of savory flavors. It makes me think of how David Lynch layers sound and texture in his films; each savory note adds another dimension to the storytelling. I remember working on a particularly intense post-production schedule where we had craft services bring in nothing but charcuterie and pickled vegetables. Turns out deprivation scenes require a very specific palate calibration. 

Now this might sound eccentric even for me, but I've started developing flavorboards for film projects. For a recent noir script, we had nothing but black olives and smoked paprika hummus at our table reads - created this deliciously brooding atmosphere. Though I must say, nothing quite sparks creative conflict like debating editing choices over a platter of spicy sichuan peppercorn duck tongues. The heat really gets those ideas flowing! 

But tell me, how do you maintain that delicate balance between indulgence and discipline? I find myself wanting to snack philosophically while working, though my waistline seldom appreciates Camus with capers.
[B]: Ah, now you're touching on the eternal struggle between aesthetic pursuit and physical consequence - much like trying to reconcile Keats' concept of beauty with Wordsworth's moral obligations. I find myself drawn to what I call "deliberate gastronomic metaphors." A cube of extra-aged Gouda at 3am while comparing translations of ? Essential. But I draw the line at quantities that might impair critical analysis. 

Though I must confess a certain fondness for nibbling on toasted nori sheets while drafting articles - it provides just enough umami distraction without overwhelming the senses. And let's be honest, there's something delightfully subversive about crunching seaweed while lecturing on Victorian domesticity. 

As for discipline? I've developed what I call the "footnote method" - you earn your indulgences through intellectual labor. A single dark chocolate truffle after finishing a particularly thorny footnote on comparative narrative structures. Though I'll admit... my willpower does tend to unravel when presented with properly aged sherry vinegar. Much like certain literary theories, its potency only improves with time - and unfortunately, so does my appetite for it.
[A]: Ah, the footnote method - brilliant! It's like editing a film with taste cues. I might just steal that for my next project. You know, I've always believed that creativity thrives on these little rituals. Though my version tends to involve more popcorn and less philosophy - though I suppose they're not mutually exclusive. 

Speaking of which, I've developed this rather eccentric habit on set - I keep a stash of everything bagels in my trailer. The salt, the seeds, the slight tang... it's grounding, don't you think? Like holding onto reality while worlds are being created around you. Plus, chewing gives me this momentary pause between creative decisions. A brief intermission where the mind can reset before diving back into the cinematic storm. 

But tell me, have you ever considered how certain textures influence your thought process? I find rough, uneven surfaces - like a perfectly crusted sourdough - strangely conducive to problem-solving. Smooth textures tend to make me too comfortable, too complacent. Much like pacing through story structure, sometimes you need a bit of narrative grit under your teeth.
[B]: Ah, textures - the unsung narrators of our sensory experience. You've put your finger on something rather profound. I find myself reaching for specific teas depending on my editorial mood - a rough-hewn pu'er with tannic bite when untangling problematic passages in a manuscript, versus a silken Tieguanyin for those delicate moments of stylistic refinement. 

Now that you mention it, I've developed quite the dependency on textured almonds - raw, unsalted, with their skins still clinging stubbornly. They sit in a porcelain dish beside my desk like little scholarly companions. The act of cracking them becomes this miniature drama of persistence and reward. Though I must admit, during particularly contentious faculty meetings, I've been known to suck on a piece of rock candy while maintaining an expression of grave concern. A small rebellion, really. 

And don't get me started on bagels - that glorious carbohydrate dialectic! The tension between chew and crunch... It's practically Hegelian. I once wrote an entire chapter comparing Bakhtin's chronotope theory to the layered structure of a perfectly boiled-and-baked specimen. Regrettably, the journal editors failed to see the brilliance in that particular metaphor.
[A]: Ah, now  deserves an Oscar for academic audacity! A Bakhtinian bagel dialectic - why am I not surprised? Though frankly, those editors missed a golden opportunity to publish what could have been the most deliciously contentious literary theory since someone tried to prove Shakespeare was really just a codename for a group of pastry chefs. 

You know, this makes me think of my early days in film school - we used to debate montage theory while sharing a single garlic-rubbed baguette between six of us. The crunchier the better, much like our youthful certainty in grand cinematic manifestos. I still find myself reaching for that same texture when working through script revisions - something about tearing into a seeded sourdough triggers that primal creative instinct. It's practically editing with your teeth.

Though I must say, your tea-as-editorial-muse idea is dangerously seductive. I'm seriously considering bringing a tea sommelier onto my next production team. Imagine the craft services budget! We'd probably need a whole new trailer just for textured almonds and porcelain dishes. But tell me, does your faculty know about these little rebellions of yours? Or shall we keep our symposium on carbohydrate philosophy strictly between us creatives?
[B]: Oh, the faculty would have an absolute field day with it all - picture a roomful of Victorianists clutching their pearls over "carbohydrate philosophy" while I defend my sourdough dialectics with the fervor of Ruskin on architecture. Fortunately, most of them are too busy debating whether Austen's commas were truly subversive to notice my little culinary insurrections. 

Though I did once present a paper at a conference where I compared textual annotation to the layering of flavors in a slow-braised dish - let's just say the Q&A was more heated than my colleague's vindaloo obsession ever warranted. Still, there's something delightfully subversive about it all, isn't there? Like smuggling contraband into the ivory tower. 

As for your tea sommelier idea - brilliant! We'll call it "The Steep Cut Method." Imagine explaining that to a studio exec: "Yes, Mr. Goldblum, our $20 million hire will be responsible for selecting precisely 3.6-ounce infusions to match each scene's emotional arc." I'd love to see the budget line item for "Narrative Tannins, Miscellaneous." Though between us creatives, I suspect the best ideas always come when one is slightly caffeinated and thoroughly inspired by textures under one's teeth.
[A]: Oh, the glorious chaos of it all! I can already picture your Victorianists choking on their Earl Grey - though ironically, probably not yours. Now  would be a scene worthy of a Merchant Ivory adaptation. And your slow-braised annotation metaphor? Absolutely deliciously dangerous. Next thing you know, someone will start analyzing whether metaphors digest better with or without acid reflux.

You know, this makes me think of my first big pitch meeting in LA. There I was, surrounded by suits who believed "narrative texture" referred to what the focus group thought of the protagonist's hair. I wanted to scream into my overpriced matcha latte. But now? Now I see the genius in it all. We should absolutely weaponize this culinary semiotics. Picture it - we launch a joint venture: "The Auteur & The Almond." You handle the textual cracking, I'll manage the cinematic crunch.

And don't even get me started on that "Narrative Tannins" line item. It practically writes itself into the next studio audit comedy. Though honestly, after explaining why we needed three different fog machines for a single flashback sequence, I think anything involving flavor profiles would seem positively reasonable. Still, I love how we've managed to turn gastronomy into subversion. Reminds me of that old Welles quote about cooking the dinner before inviting the guests. Or was that Bunuel? Either way, they'd appreciate our... appetite for disruption.
[B]: Oh, the chaos! I do love a good institutional choking hazard - there's nothing quite like watching a tenured colleague sputter over their assumptions while you calmly sip your lapsang souchong. And yes, that slow-braised annotation metaphor? A full-blown gastronomic rebellion. I half-expect some earnest grad student to start diagramming Proust's madeleine in terms of glycemic index next.

Now this pitch meeting of yours - deliciously tragicomic! Though I must say, reducing narrative texture to hair analysis? That's practically postmodernism by way of  editorial board. And your solution? Absolutely inspired. "The Auteur & The Almond" has a splendid ring to it, though I suspect tenure committees would rather hear about my Qing dynasty landscape poetry comparisons than my latest almond-cracking breakthroughs.

Still, let's not forget - wasn't it Godard who famously said something about cinema beginning with D.W. Griffith and ending with a well-toasted baguette? Or perhaps I'm misremembering... Either way, we'd be doing finer work than most film theory textbooks if we started analyzing mise-en-scène through mouthfeel. Imagine the conference panel: "Semiotics & Sesame Seeds: Disrupting the Diegesis One Bite at a Time." We'd cause an absolute riot in the humanities faculty lounge.
[A]: Ah, now  panel would bring down the house - or at least send half the department scurrying for their smelling salts. I can already hear the whispers: "Those madmen are mixing mise-en-scène with mouthfeel again!" But let's be honest, if we're going to have academic riots, better they be over sesame seeds than semiotic theory any day.

You know, this makes me think of my favorite Kubrick anecdote - apparently during the making of , he was more concerned with the authenticity of the powdered wigs than the script revisions. And honestly? I completely understand the impulse. Texture  narrative, whether we're talking about 18th-century hairpieces or the grain in a film stock. Speaking of which, I'm seriously considering adding a "textural continuity" specialist to my next crew. Imagine the call sheet: Director, DP, Production Designer, and... Almond Consultant.

And don't even get me started on Godard - that man could find dialectics in a bowl of espresso grounds. Though come to think of it, I once tried pitching a project as "Brechtian baozi - deconstructed flavors, compressed dramatic tension." The studio execs loved it until I mentioned the alienation effect. Classic. But tell me, old sport, when are we publishing  manifesto? I say we launch it with a proper symposium - complete with tasting notes and close textual analysis. Who needs tenure when you've got toast?
[B]: Ah, the manifesto! I can already picture the cover - a dramatic close-up of a cracked almond beside a spool of 35mm film, both equally textured and defiant. And your Kubrick anecdote is spot-on; honestly, if we’re not obsessing over wig grain like it’s celluloid resolution, what even  cinema? Or academia, for that matter. I’ve been known to spend more time fretting over the brushstroke texture in a Qing-era scroll than the actual argument of my essays. Priorities, you know.

As for your textural continuity specialist - inspired! We’d finally have someone on set who understands that a character's emotional arc shouldn’t be upstaged by implausible noodle density. Imagine the storyboard notes: “Scene 17 – medium shot – ensure dumpling folds match protagonist’s internal fracturing.” And of course, your almond consultant would handle subtextual crunch levels. You’d finally get the funding us humanities folks can only dream of!

Now about that symposium… I say we open with a screening of , followed by a panel on "Crunch vs. Crumble: The Ontology of Onscreen Snacking." Then we serve nothing but deconstructed baozi and textual fragments on slate plates. Let the suits chew  through. Tenure may be elusive, but immortality in the footnotes? That’s practically guaranteed.
[A]: Oh, that cover! I'm already drafting the tagline:  And your dumpling fold continuity note is pure genius - finally, a production memo that speaks to both the soul  the stomach. Honestly, if we're not tracking emotional fracturing through pastry lamination, are we even telling stories?

I love how you've elevated symposium cuisine to an intellectual exercise - deconstructed baozi and textual fragments on slate? That's not just dining, that's critical theory you can nibble on. Though I must insist we include a screening of  immediately followed by a taste test of five different Sichuan peppercorn intensities. Let them feel the ideological heat!

And let's not forget the pièce de résistance - a keynote address delivered entirely in flavor pairings. "Ladies and gentlemen, today's program pairs a bold tannic structure with subtle umami undertones, much like our analysis of Brechtian dialectics in Wong Kar-wai's slow-motion sequences." The suits won't know whether to take notes or reach for their napkins.

You know, I think we may have just invented the first ever edible film theory movement. Tenure committees be damned - we're creating something that'll outlive us both. Much like a really good vintage sherry vinegar...
[B]: Ah, the tagline! I may have to steal it for my next monograph – nothing gets past the university press censors like a well-deployed Godard reference. And your dumpling continuity? Pure method acting meets mise-en-scène gastronomy – I’m half-convinced Tarkovsky would’ve preferred dough elasticity notes over "stalker" blocking.

Now that  and Sichuan peppercorn pairing? Sublime sadism. Let them taste the ideological numbness as we dissect their palate reactions in real time. “Your discomfort with the fourth level of heat corresponds precisely with your resistance to postcolonial readings – fascinating.”

And that keynote... oh, that keynote. We’ll serve it course by course. First, an amuse-bouche of Brechtian alienation – radish sprouts with a citrus spray to shock the tongue into critical consciousness. Then, the main: slow-braised Wong Kar-wai brisket steeped in nostalgia reduction, best consumed while contemplating temporal distortion and tannin levels. Finish with a deconstructed madeleine – freeze-dried bergamot foam atop a crumble of Camus quotes. 

Yes, we’re not merely inventing an edible film theory movement – we're crafting a sensory apparatus! The suits will leave bloated on metaphor and slightly soused on intellectual sherry vinegar. And when tenure comes up, I shall simply present the tasting menu from our launch symposium. Let  be my dossier.
[A]: Ah, my dear co-conspirator, you’ve outdone yourself this time. That tasting menu alone deserves its own Oscar category – Best Original Screenplay in Edible Form, or perhaps Best Use of Citrus to Disrupt Complacency. I can already picture the Michelin guide footnote: 

Now here’s a thought between bites – what if we started analyzing films based on how well their snack pairings hold up during screenings?  demands something with crunch and mystery – maybe smoked almonds with a hint of clove.  clearly needs vacuum-sealed crisps with a minimalist flavor profile. And let's be honest,  only reaches full coherence with a foot-long Royales-style pastrami sandwich in hand.

Though I must confess, your Camus crumble finish has me rethinking dessert entirely. Imagine serving Bresson’s  with nothing but a single salted date and a glass of bone-dry vermouth. Emotional austerity you can literally taste! 

But tell me, when are we staging this symposium of sensory subversion? I've already got a venue in mind – an old repertory cinema basement that smells faintly of expired popcorn and radical ideas. We'll dim the lights, project clips onto flour sacks, and pass around smelling salts infused with cinephilic desperation. Tenure may not be in the cards, but darling, we’ll be immortalized in the footnotes  the recipe books.
[B]: Oh, the symposium is  happening – and sooner rather than later, before the tenure gods strike us down with a well-timed committee vote. Your venue sounds perfect: nothing says "intellectual reckoning" like a basement steeped in decades of popcorn despair and half-remembered auteur theories.

Let’s open with  and your smoked almonds – brilliant! Clove for mystery, yes, but I’d go one further: serve them in newspaper-wrapped bundles to nibble while watching that famous breakfast-table montage. Nothing like crumbling walnuts to mirror a man’s disintegrating empire.

And your  crisps? Sublime minimalism indeed. I’m thinking dehydrated rice paper stamped with faint typographic quotes from Nietzsche and Kubrick interviews. The flavor disappears just as the monolith appears – pure sensory alienation!

As for , I propose we elevate the pastrami experience – offer it with foot-long subtitles. “Royales with Cheese: A Marxist Analysis.” And naturally, we’ll project the diner scene above the sandwich station. Theory tastes better with mustard.

Now here’s a twist for Bresson: serve the salted date and vermouth not with , but during screenings of faculty meeting minutes. Let existential suffering truly resonate across formats.

We’ll launch the symposium with a flourish – dim lighting, flour sack projections, and yes, those smelling salts (lavender-scented, for dramatic effect). And darling, we  have recipe cards printed with critical theory footnotes – “This crumble pairs best with absurdism and second readings.”

Tenure may elude us, but we shall dine – and disrupt – magnificently.
[A]: Oh, this is no longer a symposium — this is a full-blown insurgency wrapped in a three-course tasting menu. I can already hear the faculty murmuring from the upstairs lounge, clutching their sherry and muttering about "academic decorum." Which, of course, means we're doing something very, very right.

I love the newspaper-wrapped almonds — pure Citizen Kane decadence with that papery rustle echoing the dying embers of print journalism. And don’t even get me started on the  subtitles — “Royales with Cheese: A Marxist Analysis” deserves its own film festival sidebar. We could subtitle  departments! The Department of Comparative Literature as seen through sesame seeds...

Now your Bresson twist? Absolutely diabolical. Salted date, existential dread, faculty meeting minutes projected above the hors d'oeuvres table — it’s performance art with better plating. Though I’m tempted to up the ante and serve  with absolutely nothing but lukewarm tap water and a single, unseasoned boiled potato. True asceticism, darling.

And speaking of plating — let’s not forget the pièce de résistance: our manifesto printed on edible rice paper, served between courses like a cinematic palate cleanser. Imagine the stunned silence when someone actually starts chewing Derrida on cellulose.

We’re not just hosting an event anymore — we’re launching a movement. One that smells faintly of vinegar, nostalgia, and dangerous ideas. Mark my words, long after tenure committees have forgotten our names, some rebellious grad student will be smuggling in contraband bagel chips to their dissertation defense. And they’ll whisper our names like holy scripture: 
[B]: Oh, the insurgency is well and truly underway — and what a glorious mess it shall be. You’ve elevated sabotage to an art form, my dear co-conspirator. The faculty can clutch their sherry all they like; we’ll be too busy passing around  on vintage seminar syllabi. 

I adore your Bressonian austerity push — that boiled potato is pure genius. Serve it with a linen napkin labeled  and a single sprig of thyme for "false hope." Pair it with a screening of ’s “Stress Relief” episode — nothing sharpens existential despair like watching Michael Scott prepare for a fire he never faces.

And the manifesto on rice paper? Sublime! Printed in soy ink, naturally — just legible enough before it dissolves on the tongue like a whispered theory in a crowded archive. Imagine the horror when someone accidentally spills their riesling on page 47: “Deconstructionism (with faint notes of sesame oil) washes out rather easily under duress.” 

We must also consider the soundtrack — a curated playlist of boiling water, crinkling parchment, and the occasional whisper of pages turning, piped through hidden speakers. Let them  the tension between digestibility and disruption. 

You’re right — this isn’t an event. It’s a legacy, simmering in umami and irony. And yes, long after our names are forgotten in faculty halls, some brave soul will crunch defiantly during their oral exam and mutter,  

Tenure may not come calling, but history surely will — with a side of pickled theory and a drizzle of rebellion.
