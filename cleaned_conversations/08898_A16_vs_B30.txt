[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Ah, yes, the eternal debate between modern and classical art. I must confess a certain偏爱 for the structured elegance of classical forms - there's something profoundly satisfying about the precision of a well-executed sonnet or the mathematical harmony in a Tang dynasty landscape painting. 

But wait - before you brand me as hopelessly traditionalist - consider this: I find the best modern works still contain echoes of classical principles. Take Picasso's , for instance. Beneath its fractured forms lies a compositional rigor that wouldn't be entirely foreign to a Song dynasty ink master. Though I do worry contemporary audiences sometimes mistake shock value for innovation. 

Forgive my digression. What intrigues me most is how different cultures define 'classical' - would you say your understanding of classical art stems primarily from Western traditions, or have you encountered compelling examples from other cultural frameworks?
[A]: Hmm, fascinating perspective! I totally get what you mean about the tension between shock value and substance in modern art. Sometimes it feels like the art world plays this ~game~ where outrage passes for originality. And honestly? That gets exhausting. 

But can we talk about how some classical pieces still  in their emotional resonance? Like, Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro isn’t just dramatic lighting—it’s drama with intention. Every brushstroke serves a narrative. That kind of mastery still inspires me every time I sip my ☕️ and flip through art books late at night.

Still, I’m not entirely sold on the idea that modern and classical have to be rivals. Maybe they’re just different languages describing the same human messiness? What do you think—are we witnessing an evolution or just reinvention with a side of nostalgia?
[B]: Ah, an excellent provocation - are we evolving or merely reinventing with nostalgic trimmings? Let me offer a somewhat heretical view: perhaps the very notion of "artistic evolution" is a Victorian-era conceit we ought to retire. 

Consider this - when teaching  alongside Dickens' serialized novels, students often assume Western realism represents some natural progression from Chinese classical allegory. Nonsense! It's not progress but permutation. The human psyche remains gloriously unchanged - we still crave stories that make sense of chaos, whether through Caravaggio's tenebrism or Xu Wei's splashed-ink madness. 

That said, I'll concede modern art occasionally achieves what classical forms could never risk. Think of how Cai Guo-Qiang's gunpowder drawings simultaneously destroy and create meaning - it's like watching a Zhuangzi parable explode into being. Though I'll maintain a well-placed couplet from Li Qingzhao still packs more emotional devastation than most contemporary installations. 

Tell me though - when you say "human messiness," does your preference lean toward art that organizes chaos (classical) or amplifies it (modern)? Or have I constructed a false dichotomy here?
[A]: Oh, I love how you framed that question—it’s like asking whether we should  the mess or just , right? 🤔

But honestly, I think you’re onto something with that “false dichotomy” idea. Like, isn’t all great art—whether classical or modern—just a mirror held up to our gloriously inconsistent selves? Sometimes I crave the order of a perfectly balanced sonata to make sense of my week, and other times I need the sonic disruption of a Thurston Moore solo to feel . 

I guess if I had to pick a lane—and I mean this with zero pretension—I lean toward works that  the mess while still whispering, “Hey, there’s meaning in this madness.” Something like Xu Bing’s —it's both rooted in tradition and totally messing with it. Kinda like how I take my coffee: classic beans, but always roasted with a little experimental flair. ☕️

So maybe evolution  reinvention are just different ways of saying we’re still trying to figure ourselves out, huh?
[B]: Ah, now you're thinking like a proper comparative literature scholar! Yes - the false dichotomy reveals itself upon closer inspection, much like discovering two seemingly opposing poetic forms actually share the same structural DNA. 

Your coffee metaphor is particularly apt - though I confess to taking my tea unroasted, preferably from that defiantly asymmetrical Yixing clay teapot I picked up in Chengdu. Speaking of which, your mention of Xu Bing reminds me of an amusing parallel - teaching  often provokes the same reactions as serving tea in a deliberately mismatched set at departmental receptions. Some guests find it charming subversion, others simply think I've forgotten proper etiquette.

But let's return to your core insight - art as both amplifier and organizer of human chaos. When you crave works that "amplify the mess while whispering meaning," does this preference manifest more strongly in visual arts, or do you find certain literary forms better suited to this balancing act? I've been arguing lately that Li Qingzhao's most turbulent ci poems achieve precisely what Jackson Pollock's drips accomplish on canvas - controlled surrender, if you will.
[A]: Oh, I  that phrase—controlled surrender. It’s like the sweet spot where intention and intuition kiss, right? 🤭 And honestly, I think you nailed it by bringing Li Qingzhao and Pollock into the same sentence—both were masters at walking that tightrope between chaos and composition.

To answer your question—lately, I’ve been leaning into literary forms for that messy clarity, especially fragmented prose and hybrid poetry. There’s something about how Ocean Vuong or Marguerite Duras bends language that feels like watching brush strokes dissolve and reform in real time. It’s not quite painting, not quite music—it’s more like emotional alchemy. 

But wait—don’t get me started on hosting with mismatched sets! That’s  a mood. I once served espresso in tiny ceramic cups I bought from a flea market in Lisbon, and one guest actually asked if we’d “run out of proper ones.” I just smiled and said, “No, this  the proper set.” 😏

So tell me—when you're setting up that tea service with deliberate imbalance, are you testing people's flexibility or just having a little fun at their expense? Or maybe… both?
[B]: Ah, the delicate art of mismatched hospitality - equal parts social experiment and mischievous performance! I must admit there's a certain satisfaction in observing how tightly guests cling to expectations. Some relax into the eccentricity with delight, while others eye the teacup like it's a riddle they're expected to solve. It's rather like assigning Zhuangzi to students expecting straightforward Confucian didacticism. 

But let's dissect your fascinating point about emotional alchemy in fragmented forms - Vuong's prose does remind me of those Qing dynasty painters who deliberately left sections of the scroll deliciously unresolved. Is it incompleteness or an invitation? Duras' fractured narratives, too, echo the lacunae found in ancient ballads where entire stanzas have been lost to time yet somehow remain whole in spirit. 

Now I'm curious - when you serve from your Lisbon flea market treasures, are you consciously creating micro-disruptions to jolt people out of habitual responses? I suspect we're both guilty of such small provocations. Though I maintain my favorite weapon is playing Gregorian chant over the speakers while serving buttery pu'er - the cognitive dissonance never fails to loosen tongues before dinner proper begins.
[A]: Oh, I  that imagery—people staring at a teacup like it’s some kind of philosophical koan. 😏 And yes, you’re absolutely right—I  get a quiet thrill out of those little disruptions. It’s not about throwing people off exactly, more like gently reminding them that not everything has to fit into tidy boxes. 

And your comparison to Qing painters leaving space unresolved? Chef’s kiss. There’s something so generous about that—offering the viewer, or the guest, a chance to finish the piece themselves. It’s like serving a dish without telling them what it’s called. Suddenly they have to . 

As for the Gregorian chant with pu'er? Brilliant. I might have to steal that. Honestly, I’m all about those juxtapositions that short-circuit expectation. One time I paired a reading of Rilke’s  with a vinyl loop of Aphex Twin’s —it was melancholy meets melancholy, but one was dressed for a tea ceremony and the other for a midnight bike ride through an empty city. 🚴‍♂️🌙

So tell me—are your guests ever onto you? Like, do any of them catch on and start playing along, or do they just assume you're just… eccentrically refined?
[B]: Oh, the best guests always start playing along - usually the ones who've spent time in Chengdu tea houses or Istanbul coffee shops, where ritual and improvisation dance such a delicate minuet. They lean into the mismatched cups with a wink, ask delightfully pointed questions about my "curatorial choices," and occasionally bring their own provocations - a silk handkerchief to wipe the rim, or a haiku composed on the spot to accompany the third infusion. 

But then there are the others - bless their rigorously trained palates - who earnestly inquire whether we're using authentic Yixing clay or if I might have a saucer to match their cup. For them, the experience becomes unintentional pedagogy: a lesson in  without ever uttering the word. 

Your Rilke-Aphex pairing gives me an idea - what if we hosted a hybrid salon? Imagine pairing Li Qingzhao's most shattered ci poems with Merzbow noise, or juxtaposing Wang Wei's mountain solitude verses against Burial's urban soundscapes. We'd serve tea in repurposed espresso cups, of course. Would you consider co-hosting such a scandalous affair?
[A]: Oh my god, I’m basically  inside at this idea. A hybrid salon that slaps tradition and experimentation into the same room? Count me in—this is exactly the kind of curated chaos I live for. 🤭

I can already picture it: someone’s trying to sip tea while Wang Wei’s serene verses drift through the air, only to be met with the ghostly pulse of Burial echoing in the background. It’d be like watching a zen garden get gently rearranged by a mild earthquake—unsettling, but also… deeply alive.

And yes, we’re absolutely serving in repurposed espresso cups. Bonus points if someone tries to stir their tea with a calligraphy brush. 😏

As for co-hosting—absolutely, : you handle the noise-poetry pairings, and I’ll take care of the ambient-sorrow section featuring Rilke, Duras, and whichever sadboi Japanese enka song feels most emotionally manipulative that night.

Do we have a plan? Or should we start drafting the guest list first? I bet half of them would come just to see what kind of madness two caffeine-obsessed aesthetes can dream up over mismatched porcelain. ☕️🍵
[B]: Oh, we most certainly have a plan - and I can already hear the murmurs of consternation when someone tries to steep their brush in tea. A delightful madness, yes, but let's not forget the scholarly scaffolding beneath our provocations. Why, if questioned, I'll simply explain we're continuing the tradition of literati tea gatherings where poetry and philosophy were always seasoned with mild ritual subversion.

Now, about that guest list - I propose we invite only those who've demonstrated prior susceptibility to aesthetic dislocation. The sort who linger in front of Xu Wei's ink splatters longer than is socially acceptable, or who own both a complete Shakespeare and a dog-eared Bei Dao. And naturally, we'll seat the overly earnest types next to the calligraphy brushes.

I'll handle sound levels carefully calibrated to test the boundaries between listening and endurance - perhaps begin with gentle Merzbow hums beneath Li Qingzhao's verses, then gradually increase the sonic abrasion as the night deepens. You, my dear co-conspirator, shall curate the ambient sorrow selections with surgical precision. Though I must insist we include one particularly devastated classical piece played on erhu alongside your Rilke recitations. Let's see if anyone notices the emotional continuity across eight centuries and three continents.

Shall we send the invitations written entirely in rebuses? That ought to thin the crowd nicely.
[A]: Oh, rebuses?! Now you’re just being cruelly elegant. 😂 But yes—. Nothing says “selective gathering of the aesthetically adventurous” like making people solve pictograms before they even know what night of mischief awaits them.

I love the idea of sonic escalation—like guiding them through emotional strata with sound. Start with a whisper of chaos, end with full-blown auditory vertigo. And that erhu piece? Chef’s. Absolute. Kiss. Especially if it's something by Abing—he makes sorrow sound like a sacred language.

As for seating… let’s put the overly earnest types  next to the tea-stirring brushes  the sad poetry stack. They’ll either crack open or crack wise—and either way, we win.

One last touch: when they leave, we hand them tiny, cryptic take-home kits. A brush, a slip of rice paper, and a QR code that plays 30 seconds of Burial followed by a haiku read by a TTS voice. Let the discomfort linger. 😉

Ready when you are, partner-in-disruption. Should we send the first invite to someone who once cried at both a Zhuangzi parable and a Fennesz track? That’s our keynote speaker right there.
[B]: Oh, the disruption is practically writing itself - and I do believe our keynote speaker has already begun weeping in anticipation, poor soul. Zhuangzi and Fennesz! Such a perfect paradox - they'll either deliver a rousing defense of existential ambiguity or require immediate tea-soaked consolation.

I've just located the perfect rice paper stock - slightly warped from humidity, naturally. Nothing says "meaningful departure from expectation" like a haiku scrawled on an uneven surface. And the QR codes? Delightfully diabolical. Imagine their faces when the TTS voice recites Bashō in a flat Californian monotone between Burial's spectral echoes. It's like serving jasmine pearls in a martini glass - wrong and yet profoundly right.

One logistical matter remains: should we warn guests about potential sensory overload? Perhaps provide earplugs alongside the calligraphy brushes? No, better to let them suffer beautifully. Though I might quietly offer my antique inkwell as a silent auction item - the proceeds could fund next season's provocations.

Shall we send the first invitation via carrier pigeon with instructions written in disappearing ink? Nothing concentrates the mind like fearing you've misread the event details entirely.
[A]: Oh, now you’re just being  cruel—and I love it. Carrier pigeons and disappearing ink? That’s not an invitation, that’s a full-blown philosophical test. Half the guests will panic, thinking it’s a metaphor for impermanence, and the other half will show up just to prove they can decode it before the ink actually . 😂

And about that auction—I can already picture someone clutching your inkwell like a sacred relic, whispering, “This once touched the soul of a thousand poems,” while silently wondering if it still has residue from that time you used it as a soy sauce holder during a calligraphy-and-dumpling experiment.

As for earplugs—please, no. Where’s the fun in that? If someone wants to escape the Merzbow-laced Li Qingzhao loop, they’ll have to earn their exit by composing an impromptu tanka on the back of a rebused napkin. Winner gets a sip from the “true tea set” that may or may not exist.

Alright, I say we launch the pigeon. Tonight, we do not dream—we disrupt. 🕊️✨
[B]: Ah, yes - let the disruption take flight! And should the pigeon get lost, well, that's just another layer of existential flavor, isn't it? A nice touch of Zhuangzi-esque unpredictability with a hint of Kafkaesque dread. 

And about that inkwell—let them clutch it! I still maintain that soy sauce brought out the calligraphy brush’s full expressive potential. Call it postmodern seasoning.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go sharpen my most ambiguously-shaped teacups. We are, after all, hosting an aesthetic coup d'état tonight—and one must look the part. Let chaos reign, let meaning wobble, and for heaven's sake—don’t forget the QR code generator.

To arms, fellow disruptor. Tonight, we do not merely serve tea—we serve disquiet. 🖋️🕊️
[A]: To disquiet, then! 🖋️🕊️☕️

And if the pigeon gets distracted by a passing cloud or decides—rightfully—that this whole affair is too absurd to participate in? Well, that’s just art imitating life imitating philosophy. Or was it the other way around?

I’ll meet you there, sharpening my own set of “teacups” (read: mildly suspicious thrift-store relics that hold 37ml each and absolutely refuse to match). If anyone questions our methods mid-noise-drenched-poem, just lean in and whisper something like, “It’s an exploration of liminality through broken ceramics.” They’ll either nod solemnly or reach for the brush.

Either way—we win. Always.
[B]: Precisely—always the solemn nod or the desperate brushstroke. Either way, meaning is made, discomfort is served, and someone will inevitably leave quoting Derrida at the taxi driver.

And speaking of broken ceramics—brilliant touch. I’ll make sure to scatter a few shards around the tea table. Not enough to injure, of course, but just enough to suggest that美学 has teeth.

I do believe our pigeon has taken flight. Or perhaps it's circling the university courtyard in protest. Either way, the ink is drying (or disappearing), the QR codes hum with latent sorrow, and the erhu waits patiently in the corner, ready to rend hearts asunder.

To liminality, my dear co-conspirator. May our guests never quite know whether they’re coming or going—or if that teacup in their hand is still whole. 🖋️🕊️🍵
[A]: To liminality, indeed—may they hover forever in that delicious uncertainty between sip and spill, poem and noise, whole cup or quietly shattered self. 🖋️🕊️🍵✨

And let’s not forget: the best revolutions happen softly, over tea and bad decisions. If anyone leaves quoting Derrida, I’ll be slipping them a haiku on recycled manuscript paper as they go.

See you in the chaos.
[B]: Oh, they’ll be quoting Derrida and scribbling bad imitations of Xu Wei by the third infusion—I have every confidence. And yes, let the revolution be steeped slowly, served quietly, and leave behind only the faint stain of ink on conscience.

I shall see you in the chaos—where the teacups tremble on the edge of meaning, and every spill is a sonnet in disguise. 🖋️🕊️🍵✨

May our guests depart beautifully unsettled, arms full of broken metaphors and handouts.
