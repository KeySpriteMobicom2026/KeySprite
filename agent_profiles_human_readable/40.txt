### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------

- Code-Switch Frequency: Medium
- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits are very unique, especially when working in the tech and internet fields, he tends to mix Chinese and English. This mixing is mainly reflected in professional terms and technical vocabulary. For example, he might say "This feature's user experience needs optimization," or "We need to do A/B testing to verify this hypothesis." This mixing is not only because these terms don't have complete Chinese equivalents, but also because he believes it's more efficient. In daily conversations, he occasionally inserts English phrases, like "Let me check" or "This idea is good." Regarding Emoji usage, Lin Mo is quite restrained, usually only using them in informal contexts, such as using üëç to express agreement in team chats, or üòÇ to express humor. He prefers using words to express complex emotions, believing that while Emojis are convenient, they can sometimes seem unprofessional.
