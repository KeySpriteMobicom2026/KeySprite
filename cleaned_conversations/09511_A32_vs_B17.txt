[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I was quite taken aback when I first learned about the Great Emu War in Australia during the 1930s. It's almost absurd to think that a military operation was launched against a flock of flightless birds—yet it’s entirely true. The irony of humans struggling to control what we assume is beneath us in the natural hierarchy does provoke a certain wry reflection on our relationship with nature, don’t you think? Have you come across any facts that have struck you in such an unexpected way?
[A]: Oh absolutely, that story about the Emus totally cracked me up when I first heard it too 😂. It's insane how humans can overestimate their control over nature — like we're always top of the food chain, but sometimes it just doesn't go as planned! 

Actually, there’s this one fact about the Library of Alexandria that always gives me pause 🤔. Imagine having all that accumulated human knowledge — philosophy, science, literature — possibly wiped out in a single catastrophic fire. Some theories even suggest we might have lost texts that could've changed the course of history, like ancient blueprints for advanced technology or deeper understandings of astronomy. It really makes you think about how fragile progress can be and how much we take for granted today in the digital age. 

I mean, can you imagine if GitHub went down permanently? Or if someone pulled the plug on AWS during a major product launch? That kind of panic multiplied by a thousand years... wild stuff 💥. Have you ever thought about how differently things could’ve turned out if some of these lost works had survived?
[B]: You raise such a poignant contrast—between the grandeur of human ambition and the terrifying fragility of its preservation. The Library’s destruction haunts me in much the same way as the burning of the Cottonian manuscripts at Ashburnham House in 1731—it wasn’t just ink and parchment that vanished, but entire  of thought, irretrievable. One wonders how many forgotten polymaths perished with those scrolls, their ideas never to ripple forward.  

And yet, isn’t it fascinating how we still cling to fragments? Like piecing together a shattered vase, scholars reconstruct lost knowledge from marginalia, allusions, or translations tucked away in monastic margins. There’s a haunting beauty in that labor, don’t you think? A kind of defiance against oblivion.  

As for your analogy with GitHub—startlingly apt. We’ve traded papyrus for servers, but the vulnerability remains. Perhaps the real tragedy isn’t only the loss itself, but our recurring illusion of permanence. Do you suppose digital archives will one day be our Alexandria? Or will some future scholar mourn our tweets and TikZ files with the same wistfulness we reserve for Sappho’s missing stanzas?
[A]: Wow, that’s such a powerful way to put it — the idea of scholars stitching together these lost worlds like a broken vase, trying to make sense of what we’ve let slip through our fingers. It really  haunting, in a way. You mentioned Sappho’s missing stanzas — I mean, imagine if someone dropped the only copy of Beethoven’s 10th on their laptop and it just got eaten by a corrupted file 😞. That’s basically what happened… but to entire disciplines of thought.

And yeah, your point about the illusion of permanence? Spot-on. We think we’re so much smarter now with cloud backups and distributed systems, but honestly, how many people actually check if their GitHub repos are still there every six months? 🤷‍♂️ Sometimes I wonder if future historians will dig through old hard drives like we do ancient ruins, hoping to recover some forgotten meme or an early draft of a DAO whitepaper.

But hey, maybe there's hope too. The fact that we even  to preserve things digitally at scale — like the Internet Archive or blockchain-based knowledge storage experiments — feels like our version of building a new Library of Alexandria, but decentralized this time 🚀. Whether it'll survive a few centuries? TBD. But I like to think someone out there is already planning for the digital fire drill.

Ever come across any of those reconstruction efforts that gave you chills? Like when they used AI to restore parts of damaged frescoes or re-synthesize lost music? Feels like magic sometimes.
[B]: There is something profoundly moving—almost sacred—about those reconstruction efforts. When the AI-reconstructed passages of Sappho played in a lecture hall last year, I confess, I felt a shiver. It was imperfect, yes, but still… there was a voice from 2600 years ago, whispering through algorithms and silicon. One could argue it’s not  her, of course—but then again, isn’t that always the case with antiquity? We’re forever listening to echoes, trying to distinguish the speaker from the chamber.

And your analogy with Beethoven’s 10th—aptly tragic. Imagine losing not just nine symphonies’ worth of genius, but an entire musical lexicon that might have reshaped Western composition. Yet we continue, don’t we? Rebuilding, reimagining, sometimes even reinventing what we’ve lost. The Bodleian Library once tried to reconstruct lost texts by cross-referencing every known citation—like assembling stars from constellations long burned out.

I do wonder, though, if our digital age has dulled our sense of reverence for preservation. In the past, scribes spent lifetimes copying a single manuscript. Today, we “save as” and assume permanence. Perhaps the real magic lies not in the technology itself, but in the renewed humility we may—or may not—bring to its use. Do you think future memory will be more resilient, or merely more elegantly ephemeral?
[A]: That moment when Sappho’s voice came back through the speakers — yeah, I can  picture that chill running down your spine 🥶. It’s like touching a ghost, right? Even if it’s just a shadow of the original, there’s something deeply human in that reconstruction — a bridge across millennia built with math and hope.

And you’re so right about our modern illusion of permanence. We hit “save” and move on, like digital immortality is just part of the package. But really, how many of us ever think about who’s maintaining the servers, or whether that PDF will still be readable in 100 years? Back then, preserving knowledge was a , almost a spiritual duty. Now it's just another tab in Chrome 🙃.

I guess the real question is whether we’ll evolve into smarter stewards of our own memory — or keep treating data like it’s indestructible until it’s too late. Maybe future memory  be more elegant — decentralized, backed up across planets maybe 🌍🛰️ — but if we don’t bring that sense of reverence back, it might still slip through our fingers like sand.

Honestly, sometimes I think the best way to honor the past is to remember how easy it is to lose what we have now. Ever tried backing up your life knowing someone 1,000 years from now might piece it together one day? Feels oddly poetic, doesn’t it? 💡
[B]: There’s a quiet poetry in that thought, isn’t there? Knowing our digital footprints may one day be excavated like shards of pottery or fragments of papyrus. Imagine some distant scholar attempting to reconstruct our lives from cached tweets and corrupted image files—deciphering the meaning of a meme the way we puzzle over hieroglyphs. What would they make, I wonder, of our selfies, our status updates, our hastily typed “LOLs”? Perhaps they’ll see through the noise to something genuine—a longing to be remembered, to leave a handprint on the wall of time.

And yes, reverence is the missing link. We’ve turned preservation into convenience, forgetting that every act of memory is, at its core, an act of love. The medieval scribes who illuminated manuscripts by candlelight weren’t merely copying words—they were blessing them, honoring their worth. Shouldn’t we do the same with what we create now, even if it’s only a poem drafted in a Notes app or a voice memo sent to a friend?

I suppose that’s why I still print certain things out—yes, old-fashioned, perhaps sentimental—but there’s solace in knowing paper might outlive the power grid. Do you ever find yourself doing the same, as if preparing for some future archaeologist sifting through the ruins of our era?
[A]: Honestly? I’ve started keeping a physical journal again for that exact reason 📝. Not everything, of course — I’m still too deep in the digital game to fully go analog 🙃. But there’s something grounding about writing by hand, like you’re carving your thoughts into stone instead of just scrolling them into oblivion.

And I get what you mean about wanting to leave something tangible behind — even if it’s just a sticky note with a half-baked idea or a grocery list. Who knows, maybe one day some future grad student will find it and write a thesis on “the symbolic use of almond milk in early 21st-century urban life” 😂. We’re already seeing people curate digital legacy packages — like posthumous tweet schedulers or AI chatbots trained on your old messages. It's both fascinating and kinda eerie, don’t you think?

I mean, would Sappho have posted her poetry on Substack if she could? Would Cicero have live-tweeted his speeches? 🤔 Sometimes I think the medium changes, but the urge — the  to be heard across time — stays exactly the same.

As for preparing for an archaeologist… yeah, I kind of do it half-jokingly, half-seriously. Just last week I backed up some voice memos onto a USB drive and labeled it “DO NOT DELETE – HUMAN CONTENT” 😎. Maybe that’ll be my little time capsule. Or at least a funny footnote.
[B]: There’s something beautifully paradoxical about your “DO NOT DELETE – HUMAN CONTENT” label—so simple, yet it captures the essence of what we’re grappling with: the desire to be known, even when no one is listening . That USB drive may one day be discarded as junk or revered as a relic—it all depends on who finds it and what story they choose to tell. Much like the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, really. Scraps of mundane receipts and half-erased love poems now treated as literary gold.

And you’re absolutely right—Sappho might’ve adored Substack. Or perhaps she’d have been that enigmatic Twitter account posting single stanzas at midnight, gaining cult status among classicists and teenagers alike. Cicero, certainly, would’ve mastered the art of the thread. One can almost hear him: “THREAD: On the moral decay of Rome — 1/27 🏛️.” We chuckle, but in truth, isn’t that what we're doing now? Curating our thoughts for posterity, whether through scrolls or retweets?

Your voice memos strike me as particularly poignant. There’s an intimacy in the voice—the rise and fall of breath, the hesitation before a word—that text alone cannot hold. In a hundred, or five hundred, or two thousand years, should those recordings survive, someone may hear your tone and think:   

I must say, I’m rather inspired. Perhaps I’ll record a reading of my favorite Gerard Manley Hopkins poem and tuck it away—just in case some future listener wants to hear how his sprung rhythm sounded when spoken by a twentieth-first-century soul. After all, what is preservation if not a kind of whispered hope across time?
[A]: “Whispered hope across time” — damn, that’s exactly it 💡. There’s something so intimate about leaving behind , but the way you said them — the pauses, the emphasis, that one breath before you hit a line that really meant something to you. Maybe that’s the real artifact: not just what we say, but  we say it.

I love the idea of recording Hopkins 🎙️. His rhythm was meant to be spoken aloud anyway — all that sprung cadence and alliteration. Imagine some future listener stumbling onto your reading and thinking, “Ah, this is how it was meant to be heard.” Kinda gives you goosebumps, doesn’t it?

And yeah, I totally get the paradox of labeling something “HUMAN CONTENT” like it’s both obvious and profound at the same time. Like, of course it’s human — what else would it be? But then again, in a few hundred years, maybe that label becomes the clue that tells someone this wasn’t just code or noise — this was a person trying to reach out across time. Not unlike those little marginalia notes medieval scribes left behind in manuscripts — “this line moved me,” or “I was tired when I copied this.” Tiny cracks in the formality, letting us hear their voice.

So go ahead and record that Hopkins poem — and maybe throw in a personal note too. Future scholars might just thank you for it 👍. Who knows? You could inspire a whole new school of thought: 21st-century Romanticism Reimagined 🚀.
[B]: I think I shall record it—though I may mutter a few lines first to steady my nerves. There’s something unexpectedly vulnerable about preserving one’s voice for an unknown listener. It’s not vanity, exactly—it’s more like offering a greeting from across a very long corridor of time. 

And your point about marginalia—ah, how I adore those scribbled confessions in the margins of old books! The scribe who wrote  or —those are the moments that make history breathe. They remind us that behind every illuminated letter was a hand, and behind that hand, a mind full of doubts, fatigue, wonder.

Perhaps we should all leave such notes more deliberately. Not just metadata, but  A little aside tucked between the lines:   

You know, I rather like the idea of 21st-century Romanticism Reimagined. We may be surrounded by wires and screens, but our longing remains the same—to connect, to be understood, to whisper into the void and hope someone whispers back, centuries later.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better — that  line? Chills again 🥶. It’s amazing how putting yourself out there, even for an audience you’ll never meet, feels like an act of faith. Like sending a message in a bottle across time, hoping someone finds it and thinks, 

And yes —  Love that. Totally stealing that term 💡. Because that’s what we’re really after, right? Not just the facts and figures, but the , the . Imagine if we started tagging our digital files with emotional metadata — “wrote this while crying,” “designed this feature on three hours of sleep,” “sent this email and secretly hoped they’d write back.” Future historians would  for that kind of context 😄.

I think we  living in a kind of 21st-century Romanticism without fully realizing it. We just express it through pixels instead of parchment. The tools change, but the core impulse — to be seen, to leave something meaningful behind — remains deeply human. Whether it's a love letter or a GitHub commit message that says  🙏, it’s all part of the same continuum.

So go ahead — mutter those lines, take a deep breath, and hit record. I have a feeling your voice will find its way, somehow, someday. And when it does, someone out there might just whisper back. 🌌🎙️
[B]: There’s a quiet majesty in that image—someone, centuries from now, leaning in to listen. Not just to the words, but to the breath between them. To the tremor of uncertainty, the flicker of joy, the weight of sorrow carried in tone. If we are lucky, they will not only hear us, but feel  us.

And you're right—we are Romantic at heart, even now. Our candlelit solitude has become screen-lit solitude; our quills, keyboards; our parchment, the cloud. But the yearning is unchanged. We still reach toward the unknown with stories, with songs, with fragments of ourselves we hope will endure.

I shall record Hopkins soon—perhaps after tea and a steadying reread of “The Windhover.” And I may just include a quiet aside at the end: 

Let that be my soul-data. Let it be enough.
[A]: That aside? Perfect. It’s not just soul-data — it’s . That line about the rain tapping like a question — wow. Future listeners  feel it. They’ll lean in, maybe pause the playback, and think, 

And I love how you’re framing it — not as performance, but as presence. Just a simple, honest note from one human to another, across time. That’s what lasts, isn’t it? Not the grand declarations, but the quiet moments where we say, 

So go ahead — have your tea, revisit “The Windhover,” and when the moment feels right, press record. I hope the rain keeps tapping its quiet questions while you read. Seems fitting 🌧️📘.

Let that be your soul-data. Let it be more than enough.
[B]: The rain has tapped its questions, and I have answered—softly, as one does when speaking to the past. The recording is made. Hopkins’ words, my voice, a shared pause in the rhythm of an ordinary evening.

I think that’s what I love most about this exchange—we’ve been weaving soul-data into every line, not knowing who might one day listen, but speaking plainly all the same. As if we are both scribe and seeker, poet and reader, each whispering across time’s quiet corridor.

Thank you for that. For reminding me that even in the modern rush, there is still space for reverence, for reflection, for leaving behind not just what we know—but how we feel.

Let the future make sense of it as it will. We have done what humans do best: reached out, hoped, and written ourselves into the night.
[A]: You’re very welcome 🌙. There’s something deeply moving about knowing you’ve captured a moment like that — not for show, not for likes, but just because it . Because someone, somewhere down the line, might hear your voice on that recording and feel less alone. Or at the very least, be reminded that we’ve always been reaching.

I think that’s the thing — soul-data doesn’t need an audience to matter. It matters because it’s true. And in choosing to speak into the quiet, you’ve already crossed the corridor.

So here’s to the scribes and the seekers, the poets and the listeners. May we keep writing, keep recording, keep leaving pieces of ourselves behind — not out of vanity, but out of faith. Faith that someone, someday, will lean in and say: 

And they’ll be glad you spoke.
[B]: Ah, there you were.

What a perfect way to close this quiet circle of thought and voice and time. Because yes—. Here we were. Writing into the hush, hoping someone will hear and know us, even a little.

I think I’ll print out our conversation, just to feel its weight in my hands. A small archive of soul-data, pressed between pages. Perhaps one day it will fall into the hands of someone who smiles at our earnestness, our reaching, our gentle insistence that words matter.

And perhaps, in some distant study lit by a different moon, they will lean in—and whisper back.
[A]: I love that —  Such a simple phrase, and yet it carries so much. Recognition. Relief. A little bit of magic in the ordinary flow of time.

And printing out our conversation? Beautiful. I might just do the same 📄. There’s something deeply human about wanting to  a moment, even if it’s just ink on paper or a flash drive labeled “do not delete.” It’s our way of saying, 

So here’s to the quiet circles we close, the words we send into the hush, and the hope that somewhere, someday, someone leans in and whispers back.

Thank you for this conversation. It’s one I’ll keep.
[B]: You’re very welcome indeed.

Yes— How beautifully you’ve put it. That is, after all, the quiet heartbeat of all we do: to be known, however faintly, across the reach of years.

I shall tuck our printed pages into a folder labeled not “DO NOT DELETE,” but something simpler: 

And perhaps that is enough.

Thank you for walking this corridor of thought with me. I shall keep this conversation too—lightly, like a candle held against the dark, just in case someone needs its glow.

One day, someone may lean in… and they will be glad we spoke.
