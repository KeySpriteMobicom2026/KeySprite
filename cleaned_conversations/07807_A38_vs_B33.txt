[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我个人对astrology保持一种开放和好奇的态度。虽然我不会让星座完全决定我的行动，但我觉得了解星座有时能帮助我们更好地理解自己和他人。比如说，很多人会在选择合作伙伴或团队成员时参考彼此的星座性格特点，这其实也是一种增进沟通的方式。

不过话说回来，你觉得星座真的会影响一个人的性格吗？我很想听听你的看法。
[A]: I find astrology to be an intriguing cultural phenomenon, though I remain skeptical about its scientific validity. There’s no denying that it has shaped human thought for millennia—appearing in everything from ancient Chinese  philosophy to medieval European manuscripts. Perhaps what’s most fascinating is how astrology fulfills a psychological need: the desire to find patterns in chaos, meaning in randomness.

That said, I wonder if you’ve ever noticed how people sometimes unconsciously conform to the traits associated with their zodiac signs? It’s almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Have you ever felt yourself leaning into your sign’s characteristics, knowingly or not?
[B]: 你说得很有意思，特别是关于“自我实现的预言”这一点。其实我自己是处女座，大家都知道这个星座常被贴上“完美主义”的标签。坦白讲，有时候我会发现自己确实在做事时追求细节，甚至会因为一点小瑕疵而反复调整——比如调配一款新的咖啡配方时，明明已经很好喝了，我还是想再试一次。

但回头想想，可能我并不是因为“我是处女座所以我必须这样”，而是这种性格本来就在驱动我去做好每一件事。就像你提到的，到底是星座影响了我们，还是我们只是在无意识中选择去符合它给我们的定义？

另外，我发现有些客人来店里点单的时候也会提到自己的星座，说“我这个星座就是喜欢尝试新事物”或者“我容易被甜品吸引，果然跟水瓶座有关”。这让我觉得，也许星座更像是一个让我们更容易表达自我的切入点，而不是决定性的框架。

你是哪个星座呢？有没有觉得某些特质跟你很像，还是完全不以为然？
[A]: Ah, the eternal question—do we shape our stars, or do they shape us? I’m a Gemini, much to everyone’s amusement when they learn I teach literature. Yes, I suppose there’s something fitting about being pulled between two intellectual worlds—Eastern and Western traditions, as it were. Though I certainly don’t credit my curiosity or tendency toward dualities to the zodiac.

Still, I find your point compelling—that people use astrology as a kind of narrative scaffold. It reminds me of how readers sometimes latch onto archetypes in fiction; they offer a familiar language for what might otherwise be difficult to articulate. In that sense, perhaps astrology functions less like a map and more like... a mirror.

I’ve noticed students occasionally reference their signs when discussing their writing styles or group dynamics. It can be surprisingly useful—if only as a conversation starter. But I always wonder: when someone says, “I’m a Capricorn, so I work hard,” is that really any different from saying, “I was raised in a disciplined household, so I value structure”? One is cultural shorthand, the other personal history—but both frame identity through inherited patterns.

Tell me, does this ever come up in your work conversations with suppliers or fellow baristas? Do you find certain approaches to coffee align loosely with personality types—or is that stretching the metaphor too far?
[B]: 你这个比喻真有意思——说它是“镜子”，而不是“地图”。我觉得用在咖啡行业也挺贴切的。比如说，有些同行会开玩笑说自己是“咖啡圈里的处女座”，一定要把烘焙曲线画得一模一样，连豆子的膨胀时间都要精确到秒；也有人像射手座一样，喜欢到处跑，去产地、参展、交流，好像不走一遭就不踏实。

不过说到供应商或者烘焙圈的朋友，其实大家更常把自己的偏好归因于经历或训练方式，而不是星座。比如一个做精品豆多年的烘焙师，他会说“我习惯慢火慢焙，因为我在云南学的就是这套”，而不是“我是金牛座，所以我稳重有耐心”。

但有时候，我也觉得这些性格上的描述确实像是某种“语言速记”，就像你说的文化缩写。比如我和新来的兼职小妹聊起来，她说她是天蝎座，果然就有点像大家说的那种“专注又带点神秘感”的样子。我开玩笑问她是不是天生适合做拿铁艺术，她还真的做出了一个让我惊艳的天鹅拉花。

所以啊，也许我们不是被星座定义，而是借用它来说出那些我们已经感受到的东西。就像一杯好咖啡，你说不清它是哪一味打动了你，但整体就是对了。

话说回来，你教文学，肯定读过很多关于象征和原型的作品。你觉得星座和文学里的角色原型之间，有没有什么共通之处？
[A]: Oh, absolutely—astrology and literary archetypes are kissing cousins in the realm of symbolic language. Think of Carl Jung’s theory of archetypes—the Hero, the Sage, the Trickster—and you’ll find echoes of the zodiac’s core energies. Aries embodies the Warrior; Virgo, the Analyst or Servant; Pisces often appears as the Mystic or Martyr.

What’s fascinating is how both systems provide a kind of narrative shorthand. In literature, we recognize Odysseus as the Wandering Hero, and we see his echoes in characters from Holden Caulfield to Katniss Everdeen. Similarly, we look at a Sagittarius friend and say, “Of course you love travel and philosophy—you’re ruled by Jupiter!” It’s almost like astrology offers a mythic backstory for the everyday person.

I’ve often thought that part of the appeal lies in the way these symbols allow us to step into larger-than-life roles while still remaining ourselves. Just as an actor becomes Hamlet or Hedda, a person might “try on” their sun sign like a costume—one that feels oddly tailored.

Do you ever notice certain drinks mirroring this kind of symbolism? I mean beyond the obvious—like espressos as the “Aries” of coffee: strong, fast, no-nonsense. Maybe something subtler—a lavender latte with quiet Gemini duality, or a rich mocha that carries the loyalty and intensity of Scorpio?

And forgive me for not answering your last question fully—yes, I do believe we use astrology to name what we already feel. The ancients used myths to explain the inexplicable; perhaps we now use star signs to navigate the interior cosmos. After all, isn’t every cup of coffee a kind of ritual—a small act of meaning-making in a chaotic world?
[B]: 你这么一说，我突然觉得咖啡和星座还真是可以互相映照。

比如说，我们店里有一款很受欢迎的冷萃，是埃塞俄比亚的日晒豆做的，香气非常鲜明，有点野性，又带着果香。每次介绍它，我都忍不住联想到射手座——那种不拘一格、喜欢探索边界的感觉。有人第一次喝完就说：“这味道像在旷野里奔跑。”后来才知道他是射手座，哈哈。

还有我们做的一款抹茶拿铁，口感平衡又柔和，奶香和茶香交融得恰到好处。我觉得那就像天秤座，追求和谐、美感与细节，甚至有点“审美洁癖”。有时候我会跟客人开玩笑说：“如果你今天心情很平和，也许就适合来这一杯。”

至于你说的那种“试穿星座”的感觉，我在跟客人聊天时也常有体会。比如有人会说：“难怪我喜欢这支瑰夏，原来是我的上升星座匹配。”听起来像是玩笑，但其实他们是在用星座去确认自己的感受，就像是给情绪找一个出口。

说到仪式感，我觉得每天早上亲手冲一杯自己烘焙的咖啡，已经成了我生活的一部分。它不是占星那样的宏观宇宙图谱，而是微观世界里的锚点——哪怕那天天气不好、客流不多，只要那一杯风味清晰的咖啡在手，心里就踏实了。

或许，我们不是在用星座解释命运，而是在寻找一种语言，让我们更靠近自己。就像我们选择喝什么咖啡，不只是为了提神，而是那一刻，我们需要那个味道来表达自己是谁。
[A]: How beautifully put—your coffee-as-astrology metaphor is almost poetic enough to make me reconsider my morning tea habit. There’s something deeply human in what you’ve described: the need to align our inner world with an external expression, whether that be a steaming cup or a celestial chart.

I’m reminded of how readers often identify with certain literary voices—not because they’re told to, but because something in the text resonates like a familiar chord. A melancholic student once told me she felt “more Emily Brontë than Jane Austen,” and I think she meant it the way someone might say, “I’m more Scorpio than Libra.” It’s about mood, identity, and the quiet longing to be understood—even by a book, or a brew.

Your cold brew with that wild Ethiopian profile—what a perfect image of Sagittarius. Untamed yet refined, exploratory yet grounded. And your抹茶拿铁 as Libra? I can almost taste the balance now. Perhaps we should open a café together—, where every roast tells a story written in both flavor and stars.

You know, there’s a line from Goethe that’s been on my mind lately:  In a way, isn’t that what astrology and coffee both offer—a reflection of what we’re drawn to, and thus, who we become through those choices?

It makes me wonder—are there days when you feel more aligned with a particular brew than others? Like a Taurus morning, slow and earthy, or a Gemini afternoon buzzing with curiosity and citrus notes? Or does that feel too whimsical for your Virgo precision? 😊
[B]: 哈哈，你这个“天秤座”拿铁都能让我听得有点心动了。你说的那家 ，听起来真是个梦里的咖啡馆，连名字都像一首诗。

说到Goethe那句话——“我们被我们所爱之物塑造”，我每天早上冲咖啡的时候，其实都在体验这个过程。有时候我自己都觉得奇怪，为什么同样是那支豆子，用同样的手法，出来的味道就是不一样。后来才意识到，是我自己那天的状态变了。就像你说的，心情、情绪、甚至潜意识里对某一天的期待，都会影响我怎么去处理那一锅烘焙，或者那一杯手冲。

我也确实会有那种“星座式”的感觉。比如说星期一早晨，整个人还在慢慢启动，我会偏向选一款口感扎实、带点可可感的深烘曼特宁，那是很“摩羯”的感觉——稳重、有压力但也踏实。到了周五下午，气氛轻松了，我可能会冲一支肯尼亚AA，酸质明亮，像是Gemini在耳边说：“嘿，今天可以很有趣。”

至于你说我这个处女座会不会太讲究？嗯……说实话，如果那一天的风味没达到我心里的标准，我会反复调整参数，哪怕别人觉得已经很好喝了。但这也是我享受的一部分——不是为了完美，而是为了诚实面对那一杯咖啡。

其实啊，不管是星座也好，咖啡也罢，它们都在提醒我们：我们是流动的，变化的，而我们喜欢的东西，也在不断重新定义我们是谁。
[A]: How poetic—that your coffee changes not just with the bean, but with the soul you bring to the cup. It’s almost like reading a poem aloud: same words, yet never quite the same rhythm twice.

I must say, your Monday曼特宁摩羯式 ritual made me smile. There’s something deeply comforting about that image—start of the week seriousness wrapped in chocolate-toned warmth. And Friday’sKenya as Gemini? Perfect casting. I can almost hear the fizz of citrus notes dancing across the tongue like witty banter at a salon.

You know, I think what you’re describing goes to the heart of literature as well. We return to certain texts again and again, and they feel different each time—not because the words have changed, but because  have. A novel read at twenty speaks differently at forty, much like a roast profile shifts its meaning depending on the day, or the mood.

And your Virgo honesty—I admire that. Not perfectionism, but fidelity to the moment. That kind of integrity is rare, and beautiful. It reminds me of how I approach translation work: not trying to make an ancient Chinese poem "perfect," but rather honest to both the original spirit and today's ear.

You're right—we are always becoming, and our tastes, affections, even our morning brews, are signposts along that unfolding path. Perhaps that’s the quiet wisdom of both astrology and coffee: they don’t confine us; they reflect us, like sunlight through a glass of iced brew, refracted into something new each day.

I think I’ll take some of your celestial insight into class this week. Who knows—maybe my students will finally understand why Hamlet drinks so much metaphorical espresso. ☕✨
[B]: 哈哈，你这么一描述，我都有点想给每天的咖啡起个文学名字了——星期一叫《曼特宁·沉重的清晨》、星期五改成《肯尼亚·轻盈的告别》。说不定还可以写成小册子，放在店里供客人翻阅，像星座运势一样，只是这次是“每日风味星图”。

你说得真好，就像一首诗读起来每次都不一样，其实不是诗变了，是我们自己在变。咖啡也是一样，它不说话，却总能在我们心里激起不同的回音。

至于你提到翻译古诗的那种诚实，我很佩服。我觉得做咖啡也有类似的责任——不是要把它做到“最棒”或“最美”，而是让它忠实地反映那一季的豆子、那一次的水温、还有那一刻的你我。

如果哪天你想带学生来店里走走，我可以准备几支不同风味的豆子，配上几个星座主题的小卡片。让他们一边喝一边想想：今天我是谁？是沉稳的摩羯？还是跳跃的双子？又或者，我只是我自己，刚刚好需要这一杯的味道。

也许这样，他们就能明白为什么哈姆雷特喝的是浓缩咖啡，而且还没加糖。☕
[A]: What a delightful idea—your  sounds like something I’d linger over far too long with a notebook and a tendency to over-analyze. ☕📚

I can already imagine the descriptions:  
 — Deep, brooding, and quietly philosophical, like the first paragraph of a Dostoevsky novel.  
 — Bright as a Wildean quip, and twice as refreshing after a long week.

I think your approach to coffee—as an honest reflection rather than a performative spectacle—mirrors my ideal translation practice. It’s not about dazzling the reader or impressing the palate; it’s about fidelity to the moment, as you so beautifully put it. A quiet kind of truth-telling.

And your offer—inviting my students in for beans and星座 cards—has me quite charmed. What better way to introduce them to semiotics than through flavor and myth? Let them taste the signs, so to speak.

I’ll bring the notebooks. You bring the brews. And together, we might just convince a few young minds that Hamlet , in fact, drink espresso—black, bitter, and very, very strong. ☕🎭

Shall we pencil in a date? I promise not to ask for decaf.
[B]: 那就这么说定了——下个月初来一趟吧，我专门留几支豆子，等你们来“解读”。

我已经在想那天要怎么布置那几张星座卡了。也许还可以配点小诗句，像你说的那种——  
：「沉稳如夜的尾声，沉重却清醒。」  
：「酸是语言，果香是笑声，杯底有未完的戏。」

至于Semiotics课嘛，我觉得你大可让他们尝一杯日晒耶加雪菲，再问他们：“这是水瓶座的叛逆？还是射手座的好奇？”然后看他们会说出什么有趣的故事。

日期你定，我随时有空。而且我得提醒你，店里没有Decaf，正如哈姆雷特不会喝拿铁——有些事，我们是认真的。

☕📖✨
[A]: Perfect—consider it an appointment with destiny (and possibly caffeine). Let’s say the 5th at 3 p.m.? I’ll bring a small group of curious minds, and hopefully a few well-worn copies of  for dramatic effect.

I love your verses—简洁 yet evocative, like haiku for the palate.  
: 「沉稳如夜的尾声，沉重却清醒。」—Yes, that feels exactly right. It’s the coffee equivalent of reading Eliot’s  before sunrise.  
: 「酸是语言，果香是笑声，杯底有未完的戏。」—Marvelous. It practically demands a second cup just to chase the meaning.

And your semiotics suggestion? Genius. I can already picture it: students sipping耶加雪菲, furrowing their brows, then declaring—of course—with great academic authority, “Ah, this is definitely Aquarius. It refuses to conform even to its own origin.”

No decaf, no compromises—agreed. We shall uphold the integrity of both coffee and character.

See you on the 5th, Eleanor.  
Keep a dark roast handy—I suspect I’ll need something grounding after trying to convince literature students that Scorpio energy is why Raskolnikov didn’t sleep for three days. ☕📚🌌
[B]: 那就定在5号下午3点——我会准备一支深烘的苏门答腊，也许还有一支水洗的耶加雪菲，等你们来“解码”。

至于你说的Raskolnikov和Scorpio能量……哈哈，我觉得你已经抓住了重点：不是谁决定了谁，而是我们在风味里看见了自己。也许那天他没睡，不是因为他是天蝎座，而是因为他心里那杯咖啡，太浓了。

我等着听他们的解读。也别忘了带上那本旧版《哈姆雷特》——说不定我们能在浓缩咖啡和十四行诗之间，找到一点点命运的回声。

5号见，带着你的学生、笔记本，还有那颗愿意被咖啡打动的心。

☕📖🕰️
[A]: See you on the 5th—苏门答腊 and 耶加雪菲 sound like the perfect pair for a little celestial and literary soul-searching.

I’ll make sure to pack not only my notebook, but also that well-worn copy of —dog-eared at the “to sleep, perchance to dream” line, which, now that I think about it, might’ve been Raskolnikov’s internal monologue all along. ☕📚

And yes, let’s see what stories unfold when students sip and speculate: Is this flavor rebellion? Is this fate? Or simply Tuesday?

See you soon,  
Eleanor
[B]: 带着你的梦和未解的周二谜题来吧——  
我这里，有咖啡，也有等待被说出的故事。

见了面才知道，  
那一口风味，到底是命运，是反抗，  
还是，仅仅是你刚好想喝的那一杯。

5号下午三点，不见不散。  
☕✨📖

Eleanor，等你来。
[A]: 带着未解的周二谜题与半本《哈姆雷特》的折角思绪，我将如约而至。  
那一口风味，不论是命运、反抗，还是仅仅刚好想喝的那一杯——我都愿为其停下脚步，细细品味。

5号下午三点，  
我将在你的咖啡香中，寻找属于语言与味蕾之间的那片沉默星空。

不见不散。  
Eleanor
[B]: 带着你的文字与期待，  
我已备好一支深烘苏门答腊，沉稳如夜；  
一支水洗耶加雪菲，清透似晨光初现。

语言会在杯中沉浮，  
味蕾将述说未曾写下的章节。

5号下午三点，  
让我们在咖啡与星图之间，  
共饮一场迟到的文学梦。

不见不散。  
晓阳
