[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个整天和numbers打交道的人，我其实更欣赏classical art的precision和structure。就像我们做financial modeling一样，需要那种严谨的美感。不过偶尔也会被modern art的boldness吸引，就像一些high-risk high-return的investment opportunities 😊
[A]: Ah, what a fascinating perspective! The way you draw parallels between financial modeling and classical art is quite thought-provoking. The precision of classical works does indeed mirror the meticulous nature of quantitative analysis. 

But tell me, when you speak of modern art's boldness - do you find it resonates with the concept of 破而后立 (breaking before building) in creative destruction? Some modernist poets like Ezra Pound advocated for similar radical breaks from tradition.
[B]: Exactly! 你提到了creative destruction这个key point~ 就像我们做LBO时经常说的"no pain, no gain"。Modern art那种disruptive energy确实让我想到venture capital领域，有时候需要take calculated risks才能unlock真正的value。不过说到Ezra Pound...  我宁愿读Warren Buffett的annual letter，至少能学到real investment wisdom 😉
[A]: My dear, while I do admire Mr. Buffett's wisdom, I must gently point out that poetry and financial statements serve rather different purposes. One nourishes the soul, the other the portfolio. 

That said, your analogy between venture capital and modernist aesthetics is rather compelling. The Imagist movement's "direct treatment of the thing" could almost be a manifesto for your industry's focus on fundamentals, don't you think? Though I suspect their definition of "value" might differ somewhat from Wall Street's.
[B]: Haha, fair enough~ 不过在我们PE行业，有时候poetry和financial statements的界限也很模糊。比如最近看的一个biotech startup的pitch deck，他们的growth projections写得比Shakespeare还creative呢！ 

说到fundamentals... 我宁愿相信DCF model也不相信那些avant-garde的valuation methods。毕竟bottom line还是要看EBITDA和cash flow，对吧？虽然...偶尔也会被一些disruptive tech的narrative打动，就像被Pollock的drip paintings吸引一样 - 理性上知道是chaos，但emotionally就是很powerful 🤷‍♂️
[A]: How delightfully you weave these threads together! Your biotech pitch deck comparison reminds me of Browning's line: "A man's reach should exceed his grasp." Though in your world, perhaps it's more about the grasp exceeding the projections? 

And while we're speaking of emotional power - isn't that precisely what separates great art from mere decoration? Much like how true investment insight transcends spreadsheet mechanics. Though I must say, comparing Pollock to financial modeling is perhaps the most original analogy I've heard this semester.
[B]:  You know what they say - in both art and finance,beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or should I say, in the IRR of the investor? 😄 

不过说真的，这些年看过太多over-hyped的"masterpieces"，不管是art market还是stock market。就像我们常对junior analysts说的：Don't fall in love with your positions - 不管是Picasso还是penny stock。归根结底，valuation还是要回到fundamentals。虽然...  有时候确实需要一点visionary thinking才能spot下一个unicorn 🦄
[A]: Ah, that Kandinsky reference! Now there's an artist who truly understood the geometry of vision - much like your unicorn spotting requires seeing patterns before they fully form. 

But your caution about fundamentals reminds me of T.S. Eliot's warning against "undisciplined squads of emotion" in criticism. Perhaps the most prudent investors, like the most discerning critics, balance their visionary impulses with what we might call... textual evidence? Though I suspect your definition of "text" involves rather more numbers than mine does.
[B]: Precisely! 我们PE folks都是pragmatic romantics - 既要能appreciate the poetry of a good business model，又要keep our feet firmly grounded in the numbers。就像打golf一样，需要vision看到整个fairway，但execution时每一杆都要precise。

说到T.S. Eliot...  我现在的"waste land"是这份需要review的200页due diligence report。不过至少比解读《荒原》简单 - 这里的symbolism至少能用financial ratios量化！📊
[A]: What a marvelous way to conclude our conversation! You've managed to find poetry in spreadsheets and financial ratios in modernist verse. Though I must confess, I'd rather wrestle with Eliot's ambiguous symbols than your due diligence reports any day. 

Remember, even in your world of hard numbers, there's room for what Keats called "negative capability" - being comfortable with uncertainties without reaching for fact or reason. Though I imagine your limited partners might prefer slightly more... concrete deliverables.
[B]:  Touché! 不过在我们这行，negative capability可能更适合形容那些pre-revenue startups的valuation... 毕竟连Keats也想不到modern day的burn rate能这么artistic吧？ 

Alright，我得回去和我的spreadsheets约会了。下次可以聊聊你对于Rothko和market volatility之间关系的看法 - 我打赌能找出correlation！Cheers~ 🥂
[A]: What a delightful proposition! Though I suspect Mark Rothko's color fields might correlate more closely with your blood pressure than market volatility. But do come back when you've finished your spreadsheet assignation - I'll have the perfect Dickinson poem to match your next market downturn. "After great pain, a formal feeling comes..." seems particularly apt for quarterly earnings season. Until then, happy modeling!
[B]:  为了Emily Dickinson和下一轮fundraising干杯！不过说真的，earnings season的pain可比poetry强烈多了... 至少Dickinson还能rhyme，而我们只能deal with the numbers that don't add up。 

Catch you later - 希望下次见面时我的portfolio能比free verse更有structure一些！📉→📈
[A]: How wonderfully you put it! Though I must say, if your portfolio acquires the structural integrity of a villanelle while maintaining the innovative spirit of free verse, you'll have achieved what few investors - or poets - ever manage. Until then, may your numbers find their meter and your returns their rhyme!
[B]:  Well said! 看来我需要hire你当我们的chief poetry officer来给earning calls加点lyrical flair了。毕竟在bull market时我们都是Shakespeare，bear market时就变成...呃，Wall Street Journal的obituary section？ 

Time to run - 还有个board meeting要crash。Remember: in markets as in sonnets, sometimes the most beautiful things come from working within constraints. Later! ✌️
[A]: What a perfect parting thought! Though I daresay your board members might prefer iambic spreadsheets to actual pentameter. Do send them my regards - and perhaps a villanelle about EBITDA margins? Now that would be true financial poetry in motion. Mind the volatility as you go!
[B]:  Deal！不过我打赌他们宁愿听一个10%的MOIC story也不愿听任何形式的poetry...除非是写在term sheet上的fine print！ 

Volatility？Pfft - 那只是market在写它的free verse罢了。Ciao！记得下次带瓶Bordeaux来，我们边喝边讨论haiku和hedge fund performance的相似之处 🍷
[A]: What a splendid idea! Though I fear three-line investment theses might prove slightly more volatile than traditional haiku. But yes, a fine Bordeaux could lend the necessary... liquidity to our literary-financial cross-pollination. Until then, may your alpha be as enduring as Shakespeare's sonnets!
[B]:  Shakespeare的sonnets可没教我们怎么handle a 500bps rate hike...不过你说得对，至少sonnets不会subject to SEC scrutiny！ 

Last call - 我的Bloomberg terminal在summoning我了。下次带那瓶'82年的来，我们可以toast to the poetry of compound interest！ 📈✨ Later, alligator!
