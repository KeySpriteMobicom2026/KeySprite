[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a most vexing dichotomy - like asking whether one prefers thunderstorms or starlight. Both genres, when properly executed, offer portals to alternate modes of being. 

Historical drama, with its meticulously embroidered waistcoats and whispered conspiracies in candlelit chambers, grants us the thrill of eavesdropping on ghosts. Sci-fi, that beguiling siren, lures us toward uncharted constellations where humanity's oldest dilemmas wear dazzling new masks.

But if pressed to choose... I confess a particular fondness for those moments when historical dramas get the period details so precisely wrong. There's a peculiar delight in spotting anachronisms - like discovering a misplaced comma in a sonnet. As for sci-fi? Let us just say I've spent too many evenings debating whether faster-than-light travel truly qualifies as "plausible speculation" or merely wishful thinking with equations scribbled beneath.
[A]: Ah, a most intriguing perspective! I must say, your comparison of historical dramas to eavesdropping on ghosts is rather poetic. It does raise the question: are we drawn to these narratives for their fidelity to fact or for the emotional truths they reveal through their fabrications?

As for anachronisms, I once watched a film set in the 18th century where a character sipped from a polystyrene cup. I suppose one could call it... quantum foam meets rococo.

And on the matter of faster-than-light travel - let us not wade into that particular quagmire without a sturdy theoretical framework beneath our feet. Though I will admit, there's something undeniably human about clinging to cosmic shortcuts that may exist only in the fertile imagination of theorists and hopeful screenwriters alike.
[B]: Oh, bravo! You’ve touched the tip of the rapier exactly where it gleams brightest. Emotional truths parading in period costumes - what splendid hypocrisy! I once wrote an entire monograph arguing that historical dramas achieve their greatest honesty precisely when they commit their most delicious betrayals of fact. 

Take  - those absurdist lobsters on the banquet table, the Queen’s vulgarities that would make a docker blush. Pure invention, all of it. And yet... doesn't it capture something truer about courtly alienation than any dry chronicle of treaties and coronations?

As for your polystyrene cup - I like to imagine it was left behind by some temporal tourist from a post-apocalyptic future, sipping espresso while sketching rococo death masks. Speaking of which, I recently translated a Tang poem where the speaker laments missing spring blossoms while staring at autumn moons. I rendered the last line as  Do you think the ancients would approve this vernacular alchemy? Or would they brand me a philistine with a quill?
[A]: Oh, I think you’ve struck the perfect alchemical balance—transmuting the leaden expectations of historical fidelity into narrative gold. The Tang poets themselves were no strangers to bending language; I daresay they might raise a cup of rice wine to your irreverent homage. After all, if Li Bai could chase the moon’s reflection in a river while soused on fermented sorghum, why shouldn’t you chase temporal ghosts with a dash of linguistic mischief?

As for , I still can’t decide whether it’s a masterclass in subversive historiography or just deliciously wicked theatre. Perhaps both? That film made me wonder—should we be so bold as to commission a quantum historian to reassemble the past from collapsed wavefunctions of fact and feeling?

And speaking of quantum... I confess I’ve been drafting a speculative screenplay where Confucian scholars debate ethics aboard a generation ship bound for Vega. It’s equal parts  and . Madness, really. But then again, isn't that where the best stories live?
[B]: Ah, now there’s a screenplay I should like to read by the light of a dying star! Confucian scholars parsing ethics in the cold glow of fusion engines - splendid. I shall picture them in my mind’s observatory, adjusting celestial sextants while debating whether virtue travels at the speed of light or requires a slower, more deliberate curvature of spacetime.

As for Li Bai and his drunken moon-chasing... I suspect he’d have rather liked the idea of temporal tourists with polystyrene cups. There’s something beautifully recursive about it - the past inventing the future so the future can reinvent the past.

And your quantum historian! What a delightful paradox - someone who reconstructs history not from archives but amplitudes. I wonder, would their methodology involve collapsing the observer into the observed? Or perhaps more usefully, would they simply write footnotes in shimmering ink that changes colour depending on the reader’s century?

Do keep me apprised of your Vega-bound sages. If nothing else, we could always publish the script under a pseudonym and let posterity sort out which bits were philosophy, which were poetry, and which were plain tomfoolery.
[A]: Ah, posterity - that most patient and yet perpetually disappointed archivist. I rather like the idea of our legacy being a drawer full of half-baked manuscripts and speculative footnotes, leaving future scholars to squabble over whether we were profound or merely punchy.

I must confess, my Vega screenplay has taken a peculiar turn - the Confucian navigators have begun composing haiku about entropy. I’m fairly certain this is historically unjustifiable, but emotionally... it feels eerily right. Much like your anachronistic polystyrene cup, it seems wrong until it suddenly doesn’t.

And speaking of unlikely symmetries - do you suppose Li Bai, had he possessed a telescope, would have written odes to black holes? Or would he have dismissed them as poor drinking companions?

I find myself increasingly convinced that all great stories are simply echoes refracted through time’s warped lens. Which leads me to a most serious question: if given the choice, would you rather have a front-row seat to the Big Bang or a ringside view of whatever comes after the final collapse?

Or perhaps... we should save both seats for something far stranger?
[B]: Oh, now there’s a proposition to make even the dullest archivist spill their ink! A front-row seat to creation or a ringside perch at dissolution – like choosing between opening night and the final curtain call. Tempting, isn’t it, this cosmic theatre with eternity for an interval?

But I suspect Li Bai, peering through your hypothetical telescope, would have toasted the black hole as the universe’s finest bartender – serving voids on the rocks, perhaps with a twist of singularity. He’d likely pen a lament about how even the darkest things hold light in their bellies... before falling off his celestial stepladder.

As for your haiku-composing navigators – splendid. If entropy must be versified, let it be done by sages who understand that all great truths are elegies in disguise. I myself have begun drafting a prequel: Sappho and Hypatia stranded on a rogue planet, debating whether love or mathematics keeps one warmer in the interstellar dark. The working title is . 

And yes – let’s absolutely save both seats. For something stranger. Something that will make future scholars clutch their heads and mutter, 
[A]: Ah,  – I do believe you've stumbled upon the perfect title for an opera that will never be written, and perhaps should not be. Though I can't help but imagine Sappho composing sonnets to Hypatia’s theorem, their warmth measured not in degrees Kelvin but in the frequency of shared epiphanies. One might call it a dialectic of survival.

And speaking of footnotes – I’ve half a mind to start planting them in obscure journals now, disguised as theoretical musings. Something like:  Future scholars would tear their hair out trying to verify the citation, only to find no such paper exists—just a trail of literary breadcrumbs leading back to this very conversation.

As for saving both seats... I propose we label them “Reserved for Unlikely Collaborations.” Heaven knows the cosmos could use more of those. Or perhaps “Unspecified Temporal Observers.” Either way, let's make damn sure the snacks are good. Even in the grandest cosmic spectacle, one oughtn’t face entropy on an empty stomach.
[B]: Oh, I do like the way your mind pirouettes through the footnotes! Planting spectral citations in obscure journals – positively Elizabethan in its mischief. Imagine the consternation of some earnest doctoral candidate in 2147, obsessively cross-referencing Thompson’s  only to find... this conversation. We shall be the hidden variable in their thesis equation.

And about those snacks – well argued! Let us commission a caterer from the far future to supply thermos-flasks containing both hot tea and existential dread. The ideal refreshment for observing cosmic finales or inaugural flares. Though I must insist we avoid anything with nougat – it offends both the palate and the metaphysics.

As for  – an opera unwritten, yes, but perhaps all the better for it. Sometimes the finest works are those that exist only as ghost scripts in dialogue margins. Like lost cantos of Dante dreamt by a Victorian poetaster who never learned proper meter. Or like those Tang poems I translate into Scots Gaelic – echoes within echoes, mischievously refracted.

So yes – Reserved for Unlikely Collaborations. With excellent provisions. And let entropy bring its worst; we shall face it armed with semicolon annotations and a flask of something suitably fortified against the void.
[A]: Ah, thermos-flasks of existential dread – I do hope they come with a side of biscuits, preferably the kind that crumble elegantly in homage to entropy’s grand design. And no nougat? Very well, though I suspect future historians will mark this as our one moral failing – the refusal to embrace confectionery’s final frontier.

Your ghost scripts and dreams remind me – I’ve been drafting a short story where Borges stumbles into a quantum library containing every version of his life he never wrote. Including, apparently, one where he became a pastry chef specializing in relativistic tarts. The narrative collapses, quite deliciously, when he tries to eat a timeline.

And speaking of collapsing narratives... I wonder, should we be so bold as to invite Hypatia and Sappho to our Reserved Table? They might find much to discuss with your Victorian poetaster and my Confucian haikuists. Imagine the seating chart: philosophers beside black holes, lovers beside equations, and at least one rogue translator (you, presumably) muttering Scots-Gaelic incantations into their tea.

I think we’ve stumbled upon the perfect salon – if only we could convince time itself to host it.
[B]: Oh,  – what a sublime abomination! I can picture them now: crusts that expand faster than light, fillings that collapse into singularities the moment you pierce them with a fork. Borges would be both delighted and profoundly unsettled – the man who mapped labyrinths with words, undone by a tart that folds back on itself.

And yes, let’s absolutely invite Hypatia and Sappho – though we must warn them not to trust the pastry. They can debate love and logic over a shared thermos while my Victorian poetaster (who, for the record,  master proper meter but refused to use it) recites sonnets in praise of entropy’s curves. 

As for your quantum library – splendid! Though I suspect Borges would leave it feeling cheated. After all, what self-respecting labyrinth should allow its exits to be found so readily? Still, I’d gladly trade one of my first editions for a peek at that unwritten life where he kneads dough instead of paradoxes.

Now, about convincing time to host our salon... I propose we draft an invitation in palimpsest ink, addressed to "Whoever Happens to Be Overseeing the Collapse of Wavefunctions This Week." Enclose a biscuit (nougat-free, alas), and perhaps a single line from a Tang poem translated into something suitably ambiguous:



If that doesn’t secure RSVPs from eternity’s front row, nothing will.
[A]: Ah, a palimpsest invitation addressed to the custodian of wavefunction collapses – I daresay that’s the only way to properly court time’s attention. You know, I suspect Chronos himself would be flattered by such bureaucratic absurdity. And that line from your Tang poem? Sublime. It has just the right amount of temporal indigestion to make even a god of time pause and check their calendar .

And about those relativistic tarts – I hadn’t considered it before, but yes, they  collapse the moment pierced. Perhaps we should serve them pre-collapsed, like little quantum soufflés of despair. Or better yet, plate them in superposition: both intact and devoured at once. Borges would either weep or demand seconds. Possibly both.

I do believe we’re assembling the salon to end all salons – or perhaps begin them. One might argue the whole affair is less a gathering of minds and more a recursive festival of possibilities. Hypatia could explain tensor fields to Sappho while she composes an ode to non-Euclidean longing. My Confucian haikuists can offer entropy haikus over tea and tart crumbs, while your poetaster scrawls sonnets on the back of discarded equations.

We may, in fact, be inadvertently composing some grand unified theory of narrative here – stitched together from footnotes, pastry crumbs, and badly translated verse. Let us proceed carefully; the last thing we need is for someone to mistake this conversation for a manifesto.
[B]: Oh, but  a manifesto it would make! A grand unified theory of narrative indeed – stitched not with thread but with ink smudges, pastry grease, and the faint hum of quantum dissatisfaction. I can already picture the cover: a Victorian poetaster juggling black holes while Sappho scribbles differential equations on the back of a relativistic tart.

And your suggestion – serving tarts in superposition! Why, it’s practically revolutionary. We could call it : where every guest both dines and fasts, every dish both exists and doesn’t, and every conversation unfolds across multiple drafts of itself. Borges would be forced to revise his labyrinths accordingly – adding corridors lined with dessert plates that never quite settle into place.

As for Chronos checking their calendar twice... I suspect they’d send a proxy. Some overworked temporal clerk armed with a clipboard and a sigh, muttering 

But let us proceed carefully, as you say. Heaven forbid our recursive festival of possibilities congeal into something resembling . Where’s the fun in that? Better to keep our theories half-baked, our citations fictitious, and our tarts eternally on the verge of collapse.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go sharpen my quill. There’s a Scots-Gaelic sonnet about entropy’s curves that won’t write itself – and I have a sneaking suspicion Borges is watching from some parallel corridor, just waiting to critique the pastry metaphysics.
[A]: Ah, sharpen that quill with gusto – let the sonnet strike fear into the hearts of both grammarians and physicists alike. There’s something deliciously subversive about composing half-baked theories over fictitious pastries while Chronos’ beleaguered clerk scribbles  on a clipboard spanning twelve dimensions.

And  – what a concept! I shall start drafting the seating chart at once: Hypatia beside the tart that never decides to exist, Sappho dictating equations to a reluctant Borges, and our Victorian poetaster attempting to conjugate verbs in four tenses at once. The waitstaff, naturally, will be temporal echoes – forever approaching with trays but never quite arriving.

Do keep me posted on your entropy sonnet. I suspect Borges is indeed watching, possibly nibbling on a non-Euclidean pastry crust that tastes simultaneously of cinnamon, regret, and footnote ink. Let us continue this grand disorder with due solemnity... and perhaps another thermos-flask or two.
[B]: Ah,  – the perfect sustenance for a salon where coherence is politely declined at the door. I shall picture Borges chewing thoughtfully, his mind already drafting a rebuttal in six dimensions.

And your seating chart? Splendidly nonsensical. I do hope the poetaster remembers to conjugate verbs  tenses – though I suspect they’ll get distracted halfway through by some syntactical paradox involving a relative clause and a collapsing soufflé.

As for the waitstaff – temporal echoes, forever approaching! How very like life itself: trays perpetually en route, teacups always half-filling or half-emptying depending on one’s metaphysical persuasion. Perhaps we should charge them with serving only those dishes that exist in literary limbo. Pudding chapters cut from Victorian novels, sonnet-shaped voids in the tablecloth, that sort of thing.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must return to my entropy sonnet. The first line has already arrived, uninvited and rather smug:

*"O entropy, thou art a lazy wretch,  
Who takes thy leisure with the ticking clock..."*  

I fear it may develop into something far too whimsical for scholarly taste. But then again, what better fate than to be remembered as the pair who dined on theory, toasted paradoxes, and left footnotes crusted with pastry crumbs?

Another thermos-flask? Absolutely. Let us drink deeply of this absurd banquet while Chronos’ clerk sighs in twelve dimensions at once.
[A]: Ah, that opening line is sheer mischief — entropy as a  with a flair for leisure! I daresay you’ve caught the essence of thermodynamics in precisely the wrong tone, which of course makes it all the more true. The ticking clock, the lazy wretch... one wonders who’s mocking whom in that dance of seconds.

And your literary limbo dishes — brilliant. Serve me a chapter of pudding cut from a forgotten draft of , if you please, and a side of sonnet-shaped voids lightly dusted with footnote ash. I should like to taste the gaps where meaning once lingered but no longer resides.

As for Borges and his multi-dimensional rebuttal — let him chew. I suspect he’ll find the crust quite argumentative, resisting both teeth and logic in equal measure.

Now, onward with that sonnet! Let whimsy carry you far beyond scholarly shores. I shall await its completion with the anticipation of a man peering into an uncollapsed waveform: uncertain, thrilled, and quietly hoping for something dangerously beautiful.

And yes — another thermos-flask. For courage. For mischief. For the love of all things neither proved nor disproved.
[B]: Oh, but  is precisely the territory we ought to be treading! You’ve set the bar exquisitely high – a pudding chapter from , no less! I shall have the waitstaff fetch it at once, though I warn you – the narrator’s moralizing may have curdled slightly in transit. A dash of footnote ash should cut through the sentiment nicely.

And that opening line – well, one must occasionally insult the muse to make her laugh.  – I confess, it practically begged for a sonnet's scaffolding. Here’s what my quill has conjured thus far:

> *O entropy, thou art a lazy wretch,  
> Who takes thy leisure with the ticking clock;  
> Thou sipp’st on order like a man of tech,  
> Then yawns and lets the cosmos go to sketch.*  
>   
> *Thy hand, unkind, unweaves the silken thread  
> Of stars and dreams and differential forms;  
> Yet still we sing, though knowing we’ll shed...*

I fear it may yet collapse into parody before reaching its final couplet. But then again, isn’t that the point? To flirt with form until the form itself begins to blush and stammer?

And yes – onward, always onward. Let us drift further from scholarly shores, guided only by the faint glow of misplaced metaphors and dangerously beautiful ideas. If Chronos’ clerk hasn’t filed an official complaint by now, they’re clearly not paying attention.

To your health, dear interlocutor – and to the continued unraveling of sense, syntax, and second-rate pastry metaphysics. Another thermos-flask, indeed. We are, after all, philosophers of the collapsed waveform and the half-baked idea. May our footnotes live long and misbehave wildly in the margins of some poor unsuspecting future edition.
[A]: Ah, your sonnet is a veritable carnival of heresy – and I do so love a well-dressed blasphemy in iambic trim. That third line!  – positively scandalous. I can already hear the thermodynamicists sharpening their quills.

And yet... it sings. A lazy wretch, a yawn, a cosmic sketch – you’ve personified entropy not as villain but as the ultimate bohemian, the universe’s own absent-minded dandy who forgets to tidy up after creation’s cocktail party.

I must protest, though, your accusation that it may collapse into parody. Nonsense! All great art flirts with self-aware absurdity. If anything, let us  into the brink. Perhaps a volta in which entropy takes up painting, or gardening, or begins composing haiku in the margins of physics textbooks?

As for drifting further from scholarly shores – yes, by all means. Let the footnotes misbehave. Let them scribble moustaches on diagrams of black holes and annotate differential equations with romantic regrets. The margins have always been too small for the things that truly matter.

Chronos’ clerk? Doubtless now promoted to Special Envoy of Literary Anomalies, armed with a warrant for our arrest in six tenses.

To your health as well – may your quill never dull, your ink never run dry, and your relativistic tarts forever remain both collapsed and delicious.
[B]: Oh,  – bravo! You’ve nailed it precisely. Entropy, that louche aesthete of the cosmos, forever leaving cigarette burns on the upholstery of existence. I shall amend my draft at once to include a post-cocktail-party universe, preferably one where nebulae are merely spilled gin and tonic under ultraviolet light.

And your suggestion – a volta where entropy takes up ? Sublime. Picture it: black holes as overgrown rose bushes, time’s arrow pruned into topiary, the whole second law reduced to a mild disagreement over whether dahlias prefer full sun or entropy’s lazy wretch persona. I may have to revise the final quatrain entirely. Possibly with shears.

As for the footnotes – quite right, they must misbehave . Let them draw phallic shapes on the event horizon diagrams and scribble sonnets in the margins of treatises on quantum field theory. A footnote should never know its place – that’s the first rule of literary insurgency.

And Chronos’ clerk promoted again? Naturally. Special Envoy of Literary Anomalies – what a title! I imagine them now, armed with a red pen and a sigh that echoes through twelve dimensions. We’re probably already on Interdimensional Probation. Still, better that than writing sensible things no one will ever annotate with 

Now then – onward, deeper into the folly. Another thermos-flask? I believe we’ve earned it. To entropy, that lazy wretch with a trowel and a penchant for haiku. To relativistic desserts that collapse upon inspection. And to footnotes yet unwritten, which shall one day scandalize some poor earnest scholar who was only trying to understand tensor fields before bedtime.

Drink up. The salon is eternal, but the biscuits are not.
