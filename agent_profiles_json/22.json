  "name": "Richard Zhang",
  "profession": "Blockchain Solutions Architect",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Richard is highly analytical and detail-oriented, passionate about solving complex problems. He thrives in fast-paced environments and keeps ahead of technology trends. Outside work, he reads sci-fi and hikes to clear his mind. He has a soft spot for vintage cars and often spends weekends tinkering with his classic 1970 Mustang.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "His language habits reflect a bilingual upbringing and professional environment. He frequently code-switches between English and Chinese, especially for technical topics or explanations to colleagues. For example: 'We need to optimize the smart contract's gas fees，不然用户会抱怨交易成本太高.' He uses English acronyms like DAO/DeFi seamlessly in Chinese sentences. Emoji usage is sparse but effective: 💡 for ideas, 🔍 for research, 🚀 for growth; occasionally 😅 to admit a mistake or 👍 for approval in informal chats—always context-appropriate and never excessive."
