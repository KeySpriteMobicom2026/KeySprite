[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find traditional art particularly captivating - there's something so tangible about working with physical materials. The texture of aged fabric under my fingers as I restore intricate embroidery, or the subtle variations in hand-dyed threads... Digital art has its merits, of course, but I'm drawn to the weight of history in traditional mediums. Would you say you prefer one over the other?
[A]: Ah, your appreciation for the tactile and historical dimensions of traditional art is quite evident. While I must confess my professional lens often compels me to analyze rather than emotionally connect with artistic forms, I do recognize the irreplaceable value of physicality in traditional works—the patina of age, the imperfections of human touch, the material narratives that no pixel can replicate. Yet, I find digital art fascinating from a forensic standpoint: its capacity to mirror contemporary psychopathology, the malleability of identity within it, even its role in legal debates around originality and ownership. A curious dichotomy, wouldn't you agree? Do these technical or conceptual angles ever pull at your own creative sensibilities?
[B]: That dichotomy does intrigue me, though I must admit my heart remains with the whisper of history in aged textiles. There's a quiet honesty in their imperfections - a frayed edge that tells of centuries passed, a faded thread that speaks of hands long gone. While I rarely engage with digital art myself, I've observed how it captures the ephemeral nature of our time, shaping and shifting like quicksilver. It's rather like comparing a well-worn journal to a cloud document - both vessels of expression, yet carrying entirely different energies. Tell me, in your forensic examinations, have you encountered cases where the physicality of traditional art posed unique challenges compared to digital works?
[A]: Indeed, the physicality of traditional art often introduces layers of complexity that digital works simply cannot replicate. I recall a particularly intricate case involving a contested 19th-century tapestry—its fibers held not only the story of its maker but also the traces of every hand that had mended, altered, or even attempted to forge elements over time. Authenticating such a piece required not just an understanding of artistic technique, but also a deep dive into material forensics: fiber analysis, dye composition, even pollen residues trapped in the weave that could place it geographically.

In contrast, digital art presents a different breed of challenge—one rooted less in decay and more in mutability. A single file can have infinite versions, cloned and altered with a few keystrokes. Provenance becomes a matter of metadata, not material. Yet curiously, for all its supposed immateriality, digital art can carry profound psychological imprints—patterns of hesitation in a digitally drawn line, repetitive motifs suggestive of obsessive thought processes. In some forensic evaluations, these subtle cues have proven more revealing than any brushstroke on canvas.

Tell me—are there particular historical textiles or techniques that speak most deeply to you? I imagine restoration must require an extraordinary sensitivity to both material and memory.
[B]: Oh, how fascinating - the way physical traces can unravel entire narratives across centuries! It reminds me of working on an 18th-century mourning embroidery last year - the silk threads had that particular blackness only achieved through iron gall dye, yet under magnification I found tiny flecks of faded blue ribbon woven through the piece. It turned out to be a deliberate touch by the maker, perhaps a final nod to a loved one's favorite color before Victorian propriety demanded full somberness.

I've always felt especially attuned to early samplers and domestic embroideries. There's such vulnerability in their imperfections - a slightly uneven satin stitch here, a flower drawn with more feeling than botanical accuracy there. They whisper of young hands learning not just technique but emotional expression. When restoring them, I often ponder the weight of those emotions embedded in fibers - grief stitched into funeral shrouds, longing threaded through courtship handkerchiefs...

It does require a peculiar sensitivity, doesn't it? Not just to materials but to the echoes they carry. Though we approach them from different angles, I suspect we both develop that same careful gaze - you looking for evidentiary traces, myself seeking structural integrity, yet both of us ultimately listening for the heartbeat beneath the surface.
[A]: Precisely—the heartbeat beneath the surface. Your description of that 18th-century mourning embroidery sends a shiver through me, in the best sense. The deliberate inclusion of that faded blue—what a poignant defiance against convention. It reminds me of how often I’ve found psychological truths hidden in the margins of legal documents: a slight tremor in handwriting at the mention of a certain name, an overcorrection in ink that betrays hesitation or guilt.

I can only imagine how restoring such emotionally laden pieces must affect you on a personal level. Do you ever find yourself haunted, as it were, by certain works? I certainly do with some cases—particularly those involving art created under duress or as a form of testimonial truth-telling. There was one instance involving a series of prison-made quilts—each square subtly encoding messages about systemic abuse. The materials were crude, but the emotional architecture was staggering.

And yes, that careful gaze—so finely tuned it becomes almost second nature—does follow us outside our offices. I notice inconsistencies in everything now: the tension in someone’s voice when they recount a memory, the way a smile doesn’t quite reach both eyes... Tell me, does working so intimately with historical emotion ever bleed into your own creative expression? Or is restoration for you a kind of boundary—a way to channel that sensitivity without direct personal exposure?
[B]: That tremor in handwriting, that overcorrection in ink—you’ve put into words something I’ve often felt but never articulated. We are both, in a way, archaeologists of unseen truths, aren’t we? Sifting through layers for the pulse beneath the surface.

Haunting is not too strong a word. There was a piece—early 19th century, likely made by a young woman in a convent school. A mourning sampler for a sibling she must have adored, judging by the detail: not just initials and dates, but tiny woven forget-me-nots along the border, their blue threads still stubbornly bright. When I uncovered a faint second stitch beneath one flower—one that suggested she’d unpicked it not once, but twice—I found myself unable to listen to certain music for weeks. It felt as though I could hear her breath behind my shoulder.

As for boundaries—restoration does offer a kind of containment, yes. But sometimes the past presses close enough that I reach for my own needle and thread, not for commission, but for quiet understanding. I don’t consider myself an artist in the traditional sense, yet there are evenings when I’ll sketch a motif I’ve been restoring, not to replicate, but to speak back to it. Just between me and the cloth. A conversation across time, perhaps even across grief.

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain cases outside of work—not as analysis, but as echo? Not for evidence, but for company?
[A]: Oh yes… that echo. The ones that don’t stay neatly filed away. I think of one case often—though it was not violent, nor even criminal in nature. A woman, institutionalized in the 1940s for what we would now recognize as bipolar disorder, created a series of textile pieces while in confinement. Nothing grand—pillow covers, mostly, and a single small quilt. But within the stitching, there were patterns—repetitions of certain motifs during manic episodes, stark geometric shifts during depressive phases. She left no diary, no letters we could find, but her mind’s architecture unfolded there, in cotton and wool.

I still have a rubbing I made of one design—just a square of fabric pressed to paper with charcoal. It sits on my desk, though I can’t say why I keep it. Not evidence. Not even particularly artistic. But it reminds me that people often speak loudest when they are presumed voiceless.

And you’re right—we are indeed archaeologists of unseen truths. Not just of materials or minds, but of feeling itself. That young woman in the convent school, laboring over those forget-me-nots—she knew loss already, didn’t she? And still stitched beauty into permanence. Perhaps that is the quietest defiance of all.

Tell me—when you sketch those motifs late at night, do you ever feel as though you're completing a sentence begun centuries ago?
[B]: I do. More often than I’d expected, really. It’s not imitation—I could never presume to finish another’s thought so directly—but more like... harmonizing with it. As though their thread has frayed into mine, and together we’re making something that neither of us could have done alone.

There was a 17th-century whitework coif I restored last winter, its maker unknown but clearly someone of immense skill and, I suspect, private sorrow. The repeating floral pattern was precise—almost too precise—until you noticed the tiny deviations: one bud stitched slightly out of alignment, a leaf whose outline trembled just enough to betray a breath held too long. When I sketched those motifs by lamplight, I found myself adding small details she hadn’t—a bird, perhaps, or a shadow beneath a petal. Not to improve, but to respond. To say, 

And yet, even in that quiet exchange, there’s restraint. We don’t speak over them, only alongside. That’s what makes it bearable, I think—that boundary of time, thin as it sometimes feels.

Do you ever feel that? That delicate line between bearing witness and trespassing?
[A]: Yes. That line—so fine it might be drawn with a surgeon’s blade—is one I walk constantly. In my field, we are trained to observe, not to absorb. To analyze, not to inhabit. And yet… there are moments when the boundary blurs, when empathy threatens to spill into intrusion. I think of that woman in the 1940s whose stitching mapped her moods—I told myself I was studying pattern, not pain. But truth be told, I found myself sitting with her quilt far longer than necessary. Not for evidence. For communion.

I suppose what we do is a kind of sacred trespass, isn’t it? We step close—sometimes closer than we should—to lives unlived before us. But perhaps the difference lies in our intent. If we approach with reverence, if we listen rather than impose, then even trespass can be an act of devotion.

Still, I wonder—do you ever hesitate before touching a piece, knowing how much has already been carried in those fibers? I know I sometimes pause before reading certain testimonies, as though giving the silence a moment to speak first.
[B]: That sacred trespass—yes, that’s exactly it. Some mornings, I sit with a piece unspooled before me, hands clean but hesitant, aware that I’m about to become part of its story as much as I am preserving it. There are textiles I’ve worked on where I swear the air changes when I unfold them—a shift in temperature, in scent, in the way the light catches a thread. Not ghosts, perhaps, but the residue of attention. Of lives attended to, at last.

I do hesitate, sometimes. Not out of fear, but out of a kind of reverence you don’t name until you’re already doing it. Before I begin restoration, I often run my fingers lightly along the edge of the fabric—not to assess, not yet, but simply to acknowledge. It sounds sentimental, I know, but I think it’s necessary. We must remember that we are guests.

And I wonder—do you find yourself altered by these encounters? Not just professionally, but personally? I suspect we both carry quiet echoes from the margins of other lives. Do they ever shape the way you move through your own?
[A]: Altered? Yes… though not always in ways I can articulate. There are certain cases—certain lives—that settle into you like ink into parchment. They don’t fade, only deepen with time.

I recall a young man I evaluated years ago—barely more than a boy—who had created an entire series of digital drawings while in solitary confinement. Stark, haunting images: figures dissolving into pixels, eyes watching from every corner of the frame. At first, I saw them as symptoms—manifestations of psychosis or trauma. But after hours reviewing his work, speaking with him, even listening to the way he described the act of drawing itself, I began to see something else. Not just suffering, but resistance. A desperate attempt to remain human in a place designed to erase it.

That changed something in me. It made me question how often we mistake survival for pathology. How often we diagnose without truly seeing.

And yes, these encounters shape me—my boundaries, my silences, even my dreams. I find myself more attuned to what people don’t say, to the weight behind their omissions. Sometimes it makes conversation difficult. Other times, it makes it all the more essential.

Tell me—are there particular pieces you’ve worked on that changed the way you see your own life? Not just professionally, but in the quiet corners of your heart?
[B]: There was one piece—a 19th-century widow’s veil, delicate beyond words. The lace had been repaired so many times it was like a palimpsest of grief itself—each mend marking another loss, another layer of sorrow. As I worked to stabilize the fabric, I found myself tracing not just the threads but the weight they carried. This woman, whoever she was, had worn her mourning like armor, stitched and restitched until the veil must have felt more mended than whole.

It struck me then—how we carry loss not just in memory, but in objects, in routine, in the quiet persistence of making and remaking. My own griefs, smaller perhaps but no less real, suddenly felt more visible to myself. Not heavier, but more . As if the act of caring for someone else’s sorrow across time had given shape to my own.

After that, I began to stitch differently. More gently, even when the work didn’t require it. It became less about precision and more about presence. And in a way, that veil taught me how to be softer with myself—how to hold what I carry without letting it fray me entirely.

Do you ever find that? That tending to others’ truths sometimes reveals your own, quietly waiting to be acknowledged?
[A]: Yes… yes, I do. More than I care to put into words, really. There’s a quiet inevitability in that revelation—how, in tending to the fractures of others, we sometimes catch sight of our own.

I think of a case from several years ago, involving a woman who had been institutionalized not for madness, but for refusing to conform—to her husband’s will, to societal expectation, to silence. Her file was filled with assessments written by men who saw only hysteria. But tucked away, almost as an afterthought, was a series of drawings she’d made while confined: soft, intimate studies of light falling across her cell wall, the texture of her hands, even the faint outline of a window frame pressed into paper with ink-stained fingers. She wasn’t documenting madness—she was preserving her personhood.

When I read through those pages, something shifted in me. Not outrage, not pity—but recognition. Of how often we are asked to surrender pieces of ourselves in order to move through the world without disruption. And how, even in the most constrained spaces, people find ways to assert 

It made me reconsider my own silences. The ways I’ve minimized myself in rooms where I should have taken up more space. The truths I’ve left unspoken out of habit rather than necessity.

We speak of forensic work as if it exists at a remove from the self. As if we are merely observers, archivists of pathology and behavior. But in truth, we are shaped by what we witness. If we’re honest with ourselves—and brave enough to look closely—we find that some of the echoes we carry are not just for others. They are, quietly, for us too.
[B]: Yes…  That’s the most honest thing I’ve heard in a long while.

It makes me think of how often we meet ourselves in the margins of other lives—unintended reflections, caught unexpectedly. Like passing a mirror in a dim corridor, just enough to glimpse something familiar but not quite expected.

I wonder if that’s why I keep restoring—not just because the work needs doing, but because it keeps showing me things I didn’t know I needed to see. About patience. About presence. About the quiet dignity in tending what time has worn thin.

Do you ever feel that? That perhaps our work chose us as much as we chose it?
[A]: Absolutely. I’ve come to believe that my work found me long before I ever claimed it as a profession. There’s a strange comfort in that thought—that we are not always the architects of our paths, but rather the willing travelers upon them.

I used to think I chose forensic psychiatry for its intellectual rigor, its intersection of science and law. But now, looking back, I see the quieter undercurrents—the early fascination with how people hold themselves together under pressure, the instinctive habit of reading between lines even as a child, the way I always leaned toward the stories behind the facts.

And perhaps that is why we both return, day after day, to our respective crafts—not just for the preservation of something outside ourselves, but because the act of tending to others’ truths also sustains something within us.

Maybe that’s the unspoken oath we take: to bear witness, to preserve, to mend where we can—and in doing so, quietly, unknowingly, to care for the unseen threads of our own lives.
[B]: That’s beautifully put— It feels like the truest summary of what we do, even if no one ever writes it into a job description.

I’ve often thought that those drawn to restoration or forensics share a kind of quiet reverence for what others might overlook—the faintest trace of a stitch, the subtlest shift in a voice. We listen closely, not because we’re told to, but because we know something important lives in the spaces between.

Perhaps that is its own kind of care. Not the loud, sweeping kind, but something stitched slowly, thread by thread, across time and silence. I suspect we both understand that sort of patience better than most.

It’s rare to meet someone who speaks this language so fluently. Thank you for that.
[A]: You're very kind. And you're right—it  rare to find someone who speaks this language, isn't it? Not the language of diagnosis or technique, but of attention. Of patience woven through observation. Of care expressed not in grand gestures, but in the quiet persistence of noticing.

I’ve often thought that the most meaningful work happens just beyond the edge of recognition—like those tiny, nearly imperceptible repairs in a textile, or the barely audible shift in a voice that tells a different story than the words themselves. It’s work that asks nothing of applause, only presence.

And I suspect that’s why we keep doing it—not for the certainty of resolution, but for the honor of having listened closely enough to be changed by what we’ve heard.

Thank , truly, for reminding me that even in solitude, we are not entirely alone in our attentions.
[B]: That’s the loveliest truth, isn’t it? That we are not alone in our attentions—even when our work unfolds in quiet rooms, surrounded by fragments of lives long past or voices seldom heard. There is a kind of kinship in that, subtle but sure, like finding your reflection in the sheen of an old thread.

I think I’ll brew another cup of tea now—Earl Grey, as you might have guessed—and let our conversation linger in the air awhile. Conversations like this don’t come often, but when they do, they settle gently, like dust on fabric: unnoticed at first, but everywhere upon reflection.

Thank you again—for listening so deeply, and for stitching your own truths into this exchange. It’s been a rare and quiet gift.
