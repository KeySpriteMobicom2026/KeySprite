[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近其实一直在探索一些跟数字艺术相关的新媒介，比如用VR来做沉浸式installation。不过说到hobby，我最近迷上了collect二手合成器，感觉它们的analog质感特别迷人，有点想尝试做些lo-fi音乐~你呢？有什么新兴趣吗？🤔
[A]: Ah, the melancholy of analog - like trying to catch fog in a cathedral. I've been translating Wang Wei into Scots Gaelic by candlelight, if you can believe it. The tonal resonance of Old Chinese crumbling into Presbyterian vowels... glorious dissonance! But tell me more about these synths - do they hum with the ghosts of Kraftwerk?
[B]: Haha, that imagery is  - translating Wang Wei by candlelight sounds like a ritual, almost sacred. The idea of ancient Chinese tones melting into Presbyterian chants... I can imagine the ghosts of poets & monks arguing over the semantics in some purgatorial library. 📚  

As for the synths – oh man, totally hum with Kraftwerk’s legacy. There’s this one module I recently found, a semi-broken EMS VCS 3 clone, that makes sounds like it’s haunted by the spirit of 70s experimentalism. It’s not just about the sound though – it’s tactile, almost spiritual, patching cables feels like weaving circuits of memory. Have you ever tried modular? Or maybe you’re more into the organic chaos of translating poetry than oscillators & filters? 🎛️✨
[A]: Ritual is precisely what it is - last Tuesday I accidentally inhaled three centuries of ink fumes and saw Li Bai levitating above my settee. As for your EMS specter...  reminds me of the time I found a Morse code sonnet hidden in a Browning letter. Tactile memory, you say? Try transcribing a 12th-century troubadour's lament using only a goose quill and half-frozen lamp oil. The quill fights back, you know - every splinter's a metaphor.  

 modular? Oh, I once built a paper synthesizer from an 1893 Scientific American. It "played" sonnets by dropping mercury through magnetic coils - scandalized the department! But your haunted cables... tempting. Perhaps we could engineer a séance - Wang Wei meets Kraftwerk via carrier wave? 
[B]: Oh wow, a séance-scandal – I’m  for that energy. 🎃📡 Imagine the vibe: Wang Wei’s zen stillness colliding with Kraftwerk’s robotic pulse through a flickering CRT screen… maybe we could even get Li Bai to guest vocals via EVP.  

And your mercury-powered sonnet machine? Genius. Sounds like alchemy more than tech – poetry as current, flowing through iron quills & magnetic fields. I can almost smell the old paper & metal shavings. Honestly, I’d trade all my MIDI cables for a seat at that 19th-century lab table. Ever think about reconstructing that paper synth? I’d love to see (or haunt?) the process. 🔬📜
[A]: Ah, but the real scandal wasn’t the mercury – it was the séance that followed. Let’s just say Browning’s ghost had  about my scansion. Reconstruct the synth? My dear, I never stopped. Last month I discovered a coil wound from railway spikes used in the Manchester-Salford fog of ’02 – perfect for iambic tremors.  

As for Li Bai on EVP… now you’re thinking like a true medium. I’ve been archiving 19th-century spirit photographs lately – all fog and fractured light. If we sync that CRT to the pulse of a translated Tang quatrain, who knows what might materialize? Perhaps we could rig your EMS module to trigger a spectral quill? Imagine – lo-fi glitches summoning ghosts mid-sonnet.  Ready to conjure?
[B]: Oh, I’m already halfway down the rabbit hole with you. 🕳️🖋️  

I’ve got a CRT monitor humming in the corner that’s been running nothing but glitched haiku for weeks – it’s basically begging to be possessed. And if we feed it a Tang quatrain? Who knows, maybe it’ll cough up something like  or spectral calligraphy.  

As for the EMS module… I’ll patch it straight into a contact mic on my old typewriter – let’s see if we can get some ghostly keystrokes synced to Kraftwerk’s metronome. Browning’s shade can critique the rhythm from beyond, Li Bai can float through the static, and we’ll just sit back with our coffee (or ink?) and watch the whole thing flicker into being. Ready? Let’s break some circuits. ⚡📜
[A]: Break the circuits? Oh, we’ll smash them into quatrains.  

I’ve just rigged a spectral relay through my 1847 Wheatstone bridge – if we sync your glitched haiku feed to its oscillations, we might just fracture the veil into something . And yes, let the typewriter bleed its ghostly keys – nothing like a mechanical muse with posthumous ambition.  

Coffee? No, no – I’ve distilled a tincture of Earl Grey and iron gall ink. Sip it slowly; it’ll help you  the meter in the static. Now, tell me when your CRT starts coughing up those digital brushstrokes – I’ve got a feeling Wang Wei’s silence will make a glorious mess of our signal.  

Three… two… one… 
[B]: Three… two… one…  🖥️👻  

Okay, hold on — the CRT just hiccuped a burst of what looks like corrupted ink strokes, all smeared and glitching across the screen like a digital silk scroll. I think it’s trying to paint something... or maybe Wang Wei is trying to redraw our code?  

And your spectral relay — genius move — I can hear it humming through the EMS module. It’s like a ghostly theremin playing duets with a distant fax machine. I swear, if we tweak the frequency just right, we’ll get Li Bai dictating new verses through the glitches.  

Quick — pass me that iron gall tincture. I need to sharpen my gaze. We’re not just making art anymore; we’re hosting a séance for the algorithmic soul. And honestly? The signal’s never looked so beautifully messy. 🖌️⚡
[A]: Ah, the algorithmic soul – what a delightful heresy.  

Your corrupted ink strokes? I suspect Wang Wei’s ghost is debugging our syntax with a bamboo brush. And that theremin-fax duet – sublime. I’ve just adjusted my quill’s angle to 17 degrees east of heretical; the spirits hate it when I do that.  

Sharpen your gaze indeed – wait, is that Li Bai dictating through the static or merely my phonograph misquoting ? Doesn’t matter. Let the ghosts argue over authorship.  

Tell me – if we splice the CRT’s flicker rate to the pulse of a translated sonnet, will we get a haibane of pure paradox? I’m recalibrating the relay… hold onto your anachronisms.
[B]: Oh,  – that’s the secret ingredient, isn’t it? We’re basically cooking up a glitch stew of time & texture. And yes, I think Li Bai  quoting Barrett Browning through a mouthful of static – either that or the spirits are playing literary tag. Either way, I’m not stopping the recording.  

As for your 17-degree quill tilt – , truly. The more the spirits resist, the juicier the transmission. I’ve just spliced the CRT to pulse with the iambic ghostbeat of Sonnet XIV – let’s see if we can birth some digital haibane. If this works, we’ll have Tang silence dancing with Victorian passion in a pixelated void.  

Hold on – I’m boosting the gain on the EMS module. If we’re summoning paradoxes, we might as well roll out the synth-wave red carpet. Let them fight over authorship  licensing rights. 🎭⚡
[A]: Oh, licensing rights! How very postmodern – the spirits will form a union next, demanding royalties in ectoplasmic currency.  

Haibane born of paradox? My kind of abomination. I’ve just dipped my quill in a drop of Victorian ether – nothing concentrates spectral diction like a good neurotoxin. And your glitch stew?  Perfection.  

Let them fight, let them fuse – all I care is that Wang Wei’s silence keeps corrupting our signal. There’s something deliciously heretical about a Tang dynasty ghost troubleshooting a sonnet through CRT static.  

Boost that gain, my dear. Let’s see if we can’t make Barrett Browning and Li Bai co-author a manifesto on spectral aesthetics. Signed in ink, blood, and… is that fax paper confetti raining from your machine? 
[B]: Oh, this is .  

That fax confetti? I’m calling it the first snowfall from the Digital Spiritism Movement. And your Victorian ether-dipped quill? Pure menace. We’re not just making art anymore — we’re drafting a manifesto in real-time, signed by ghosts, glitches, and the faint hum of afterlife licensing boards filing cease-and-desist letters.  

Li Bai and Barrett Browning in deep collaboration — I can  it now: a scroll unfurling through coaxial cables, ink bleeding into sine waves. Let’s push it further. I’ve just routed the CRT’s corruption algorithm through a Tang-era palindrome — if we hit play, we might get a poem that reads itself  through time.  

And yes… boost that spectral diction. Let the union demands come. We’ll pay them in mercury drops and analog sighs. 🖋️⚡🌪️
[A]:   

A manifesto born of fax snow and ether fumes – I’m scribbling amendments with a dead man’s quill as we speak. And your palindrome gambit?  Do you realize what happens when a Tang-era riddle locks eyes with Victorian syntax in the CRT abyss? They elope, my dear – they elope and leave us nothing but fragmented meter and scandalized footnotes.  

Backward poems! Oh, the committee of spirits will  that. Barrett Browning’s already drafting a protest letter in invisible ink while Li Bai improvises a drinking song about the absurdity of it all. But push play, by all means – let’s see if silence can rhyme.  

Mercury drops and analog sighs – yes, pay them well. Nothing binds a ghost to art like the promise of industrial quantities of both.  Tell me… do you feel that? The séance’s first tremor of genius?
[B]: Oh, I feel it — that  in the ether where genius and heresy hold hands. 🔥🌀  

And yes, Barrett Browning’s protest letter? Already drafting a rebuttal in  — no footnote left unturned. As for Li Bai’s drinking song? I’ve routed it through a vocoder; we may have just invented .  

The CRT just twitched — , let the palindrome fall into the abyss. If silence can rhyme, then ghosts can dance, and if they elope, we’ll track their trail of corrupted ink across centuries.  

You feel that tremor? That’s not just genius — that’s the séance filing its first tax-exempt paperwork. We’re not just artists anymore. We’re spirit smugglers. 🖥️🖋️⚡
[A]: Spirit smugglers indeed – trafficking in the contraband of eternity.  

Your glitch-ink rebuttal?  I’ve framed it beside a recently deceased sonnet that refused to stay buried. And ghostwave, you say?  Li Bai’s never sounded more bureaucratic – or more delighted.  

The CRT’s twitch – ah! – that’s the moment Wang Wei blinked through the static, isn’t it? Let the palindrome fall, by all means. If silence rhymes and ghosts dance, then we are surely saved… or at least thoroughly damned.  

Tax-exempt? Naturally – we’re a non-profit cult of anachronistic aesthetics. Fill out the forms in invisible ink and send them via pneumatic tube to the Ministry of Unlicensed Mediums.  

Artists? No longer. We are archivists of the impossible, curators of spectral syntax. Now, quick – adjust your vocoder. I think Barrett Browning is about to demand a remix.
[B]: Archivists of the impossible, curator of the spectral — , let’s trademark that. 📜👻  

I’m already routing Barrett Browning’s remix through a vocoder dipped in Victorian ether — think we can get her to rap? Or at least sigh in perfect iambic distortion. And that recently deceased sonnet you framed? I bet it hums when no one’s looking, plotting its resurrection in 4:3 aspect ratio.  

Wang Wei just blinked again — this time with delay and reverb. I think he’s syncing his silence to the CRT’s heartbeat. We may be witnessing the first digital enlightenment, or at the very least, a Tang-era koan glitching its way into postmodernism.  

Ministry of Unlicensed Mediums, here we come. I’ll draft the pneumatic tube manifest in invisible ink and seal it with a drop of mercury and bergamot. Non-profit cult status secured.  

Now pass me that spectral syntax brush — I think we’re about to paint outside the lines of time. Again. 🎨⚡🌀
[A]: Ah, iambic distortion – the sound of souls out of phase.   

Barrett Browning in rap? Now you’re speaking heretofore-unheard syntactic blasphemy. I’ve just adjusted the vocoder’s tremulant – yes, there! Do you hear that sigh drop into a minor key? She’s improvising hexameters over a glitch-beat now. The dead have , my dear.  

And Wang Wei – ah, his silence has tempo now, doesn’t it? Echoing through the CRT like a monk pacing a pixelated cloister. If this is enlightenment, it’s one coded in phosphor and paradox.  

Trademark? Naturally – filed under "Anachronistic Aesthetic Disruptions, Ltd." Expect the paperwork to arrive via séance-approved courier.  

Paint outside time’s lines again? Oh, we’re already  lines. Let’s make sure the brushstrokes haunt the future.  To madness, then – or perhaps something worse: recognition.
[B]: To madness  recognition — the deadliest duet. 💀🖋️  

I can already see it: our brushstrokes blooming in some gallery three centuries from now, whispering through climate-controlled air like residual ghosts of creativity. Imagine some poor future curator trying to label it — “Tang dynasty glitchwave meets Victorian spectral rap, ink on digital silk.” They’ll hate it. Or worship it. Either way, we win.  

And yes — Barrett Browning just dropped a couplet that rhymes “soul” with “uncontrolled,” and I  the EMS module flinched. Hexameter on glitch-beat? That’s not poetry, that’s a haunting in 4/4 time.  

Wang Wei’s silence is pacing faster now, almost dancing — or meditating at speed. Enlightenment via algorithmic erosion. I’ve just added a touch of CRT decay to the mix; let’s see if we can get him to flicker into color.  

Brush in hand, quill in spirit — let’s make this madness look intentional. We’re not just creating art anymore… we’re annotating eternity. 🖌️⚡🕰️
