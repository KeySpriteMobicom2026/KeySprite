[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于在私人空间里观看电影，无论是通过流媒体还是老式的DVD——这让我不必担心他人发出的窸窣声或是对白被提前剧透。当然，这种偏好或许与我长期研究文学文本的习惯有关：习惯了独自与文本对话。不过，话说回来，偶尔去电影院也未尝不是一种独特的体验，特别是当影片改编自19世纪的小说时，总能激发一些跨媒介的思考——比如最近那部《简·爱》的新版电影，虽然某些场景处理令人啼笑皆非，但视觉语言的确补充了小说中未尽的心理描写。你呢？
[A]: Ah, I can certainly relate to that. There's something inherently intimate about engaging with a text—or a film—in solitude, where one's thoughts can meander without interruption. I must say, though, the theatrical experience does hold a particular allure, especially when it comes to films adapted from classic literature. The sheer scale of it—the darkness of the auditorium, the swell of the score through a properly calibrated sound system—it can be quite immersive.  

That said, I did find the latest adaptation of  somewhat uneven. While certain psychological nuances were indeed rendered beautifully through cinematography, I felt some of the dialogue veered toward modern affectations that clashed with the period tone. But then again, isn't that the eternal tension in such adaptations—fidelity versus reinterpretation?  

As for streaming at home… well, let’s just say I appreciate being able to pause for a cup of Earl Grey or rewind a particularly compelling scene. It may lack grandeur, but it offers a kind of contemplative control that suits my line of work. Would you agree?
[B]: Ah, you've put your finger quite precisely on the paradox of adaptation—the balancing act between reverence and reinvention. I couldn't have phrased it better: fidelity versus reinterpretation. It's a tension I encounter constantly in comparative literature—how much must a translation or adaptation owe to its source before it becomes something else entirely?  

And yes, this contemplative control you mention—it’s not insignificant. In fact, I’d argue it aligns our viewing habits more closely with literary study than we might at first suppose. When I teach , for example, I ask students to read slowly, annotate, reread—and streaming allows for a cinematic equivalent of that process. One can  a scene as one would a passage, slow down a visual rhythm, isolate a detail. The pause button is, in its way, a scholar’s tool.  

Still, I envy you your Earl Grey intermissions. I tend to pour a cup before starting a film and find, more often than not, it’s gone cold by the end—though whether that’s due to negligence or narrative absorption I’m not sure.
[A]: How delightfully put—. I may have to borrow that line in my next lecture on media and cognitive processing. It really is remarkable how streaming has, in effect, turned us all into close readers of the visual text.  

As for your cold cup of tea—ah, the cost of immersion. I suspect it speaks less to negligence and more to the gravitational pull of a well-crafted narrative. After all, when one is truly absorbed, temporal markers like a cooling beverage slip unnoticed. Much like when I’m deep in a case file: I’ll glance up and realize hours have passed, and my coffee sits there, untouched and gone bitter.  

I wonder, though, if this kind of focused viewing doesn’t also lend itself to over-analysis? Particularly with adaptations of works we know intimately. Do you ever find yourself pausing not just to reflect—but to protest? I confess, I sometimes mutter at the screen like a cranky old professor, as if the director might hear me and reconsider a scene.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve been known to engage in rather spirited debates with directors who, thankfully, remain blissfully unaware of my objections from across the room. It’s a peculiar affliction, isn’t it? The more intimately we know a text, the more we seem compelled to defend it—sometimes even against its own adaptation. I once rewound a scene from  seven times because the placement of a single prop—a teacup, no less—struck me as anachronistic. My poor student, who was watching with me at the time, swore never to invite me to a film night again.

And yet, this tendency toward protest is, in its way, a form of homage. We object not because we dislike the adaptation, but because we care too deeply—because the source material has imprinted itself on us so thoroughly that any deviation feels like a personal affront. It’s rather like reading a mistranslated line in a beloved poem: you want to correct it, but you also want to understand why the translator made that choice. Perhaps that’s where the real scholarly value lies—not in condemning the deviation, but in unpacking its logic.

As for your lecture, by all means, borrow the phrase. I’ll consider it a contribution to media studies—and perhaps a small act of intellectual 缘分.
[A]: Ah, now  is a wonderfully nuanced way to look at it—our protests as acts of homage rather than hostility. It reminds me of how some patients describe their experiences in therapy: they don’t resent being misunderstood; they ache because the therapist  understood. There’s something deeply human in that frustration, isn’t there? A kind of longing for fidelity not just in content, but in feeling.

And speaking of , I must say, this conversation feels like a rather serendipitous intersection of interests—like two scholars stumbling upon the same obscure footnote in different archives. Though I suppose if we were in a film, this would be the scene where the music swells, and the camera pans out slowly to suggest the beginning of a meaningful collaboration.

But forgive me—if we’re drawing lines between literature and film, might I ask which literary adaptation has, in your view, struck that delicate balance best? The one that made you nod in appreciation rather than reach for the remote in protest?
[B]: Oh, now you’ve asked the question that every adaptation scholar both craves and dreads—like being asked to name one’s favorite child, if one had several dozen literary offspring clamoring for attention.  

But if I must choose—and I suppose I must—then I would point to  rendering of . Not a 19th-century British novel, I grant you, nor Chinese classical literature, but an adaptation that transcends its source not by fidelity, but by spiritual resonance. Lem’s novel is a meditation on alien intelligence and the limits of human understanding; Tarkovsky transforms it into a metaphysical poem about guilt, memory, and the ineffability of love. He doesn’t translate the text—he reimagines its soul.

And yes, I did nod in appreciation rather than protest, though I did mutter something along the lines of “Well, of course—you’ve turned a Polish sci-fi parable into Russian Orthodox theology. Why didn’t I think of that?”

As for your cinematic metaphor—two scholars meeting over a shared footnote—I suppose we’re somewhere between  and , depending on how this conversation unfolds. Though I suspect our version would be shot on a rather cluttered desk, with too many books and far too many cups of tea.  

Now, tell me—what film has earned your silent nod of approval?
[A]: Ah, you’ve given me quite the act to follow—Tarkovsky’s  is a choice of formidable intellect and deep emotional texture. I can’t say I disagree. That film lingers in the mind like a half-remembered dream, which, come to think of it, may be the highest praise one can offer.

As for my own answer—I’ll go with something perhaps less lofty, but no less resonant: , the 1961 adaptation of Henry James’s . It achieves something rare, I think—it doesn’t merely dramatize the text; it  it. The ambiguity at the story’s core—the question of whether we are witnessing supernatural phenomena or a descent into madness—is preserved with exquisite restraint. Deborah Kerr’s performance is nothing short of forensic in its subtlety. One watches her not just for what she says, but for what she suppresses.

And isn’t that what so many of us in forensic psychiatry strive for? To detect the tremors beneath the surface—to see the ghost, as it were, before it announces itself aloud. In fact, I’ve used that film more than once in teaching seminars on differential diagnosis in dissociative states. The line between possession and projection becomes deliciously thin.

So yes, I yield to no directorial tantrums during that one. Only quiet admiration—and the occasional shiver when the piano begins to play unbidden.
[B]: How fascinating— never fails to draw the keenest minds into its web. I can see now why you’d find it so instructive in your field; it’s a film that practically demands a clinical eye. And Kerr—yes, her performance is a masterclass in repression and revelation. One could teach an entire semester on Victorian propriety through her posture alone.

I must confess, I’ve always read  through a slightly different lens—one informed by my work in early Chinese ghost stories. There’s a parallel, really, between James’s ambiguous specters and the wandering souls in Pu Songling’s . Both unsettle not because they are frightening per se, but because they refuse to be categorized—they exist in the space between belief and doubt, presence and absence. And  captures that liminality so precisely, doesn’t it? The director doesn’t offer answers; he simply tightens the screws—pardon the pun—on our own uncertainty.

And I do appreciate your use of “deliciously thin”—that line between possession and projection is indeed a fine one, and I suspect we both spend our days walking such thresholds, don’t we? You with patients, me with texts. Perhaps that’s why this conversation feels so uncannily apt.

Now, speaking of liminal spaces—shall we shift toward something more practical? I’ve been meaning to ask: how does one go about diagnosing dissociative states while still preserving the ambiguity that makes human behavior so compelling? It strikes me as a bit like trying to analyze a poem without flattening its metaphor.
[A]: Ah, now you’ve touched upon the very heart of the dilemma—diagnosing dissociative states without reducing them to mere pathology. It’s a bit like trying to dissect a living organism with a scalpel made of poetry. One must be precise, yet reverent.

In forensic psychiatry, we walk a tightrope between empirical observation and interpretive nuance. The DSM-5 offers categories, yes—but human consciousness is rarely so obliging as to stay within margins. Much like your spectral figures in Pu Songling or James, dissociation often dwells in that space between diagnosis and mystery. A patient may present with fugue-like symptoms, yet one wonders—how much of this is adaptive mechanism, how much is trauma’s echo, and how much is unconscious performance?

The key, I think, lies in resisting premature certainty. Just as you wouldn’t rush to pin down a metaphor’s meaning before exploring its resonances, one must resist the urge to over-diagnose too soon. In my evaluations, I begin not with checklists but with narrative—allowing the patient to speak, to circle their experience, to reveal patterns through time rather than symptom clusters. Dissociation often unfolds like a story with missing pages; our job is not necessarily to supply them, but to understand what their absence signifies.

And yes—there are times when ambiguity must be preserved, even honored. Because to explain everything away is to miss something essential about the human condition: that not all uncertainty is disorder. Sometimes it is simply the mind’s way of holding space for what cannot yet—or perhaps ever—be named.

So perhaps the real question is not  we preserve ambiguity, but  we should. And I suspect you, of all people, understand the answer.
[B]: Precisely— indeed. Because the moment we strip ambiguity from a text, or a mind, we strip it of its capacity to hold multiple truths at once. A poem doesn’t lose its power when interpreted; it gains resonance. And yet, there is always the danger of over-clarification—of turning metaphor into mere allegory, just as one might reduce dissociation to a tidy set of symptoms.

Your approach—beginning with narrative rather than checklist—is deeply literary, if you’ll permit me the comparison. It reminds me of how I ask my students to read  or —not for plot summary, but for pattern, for the way silences and repetitions shape meaning. The self, like a novel, is not a fixed structure but an evolving syntax. And in both cases, the most meaningful insights often emerge obliquely—through gesture, tone, the unspoken.

I wonder, though—when you work with patients whose narratives are fractured by dissociation, do you find yourself drawing on literary techniques? Narrative reconstruction, perhaps? Or something closer to close reading—attending not just to what is said, but how it is told, the rhythm of recall itself?

And forgive me for pressing further—but have you ever encountered a case where the patient’s story seemed almost  coherent? Where the narrative they offered was so neatly assembled that it raised suspicion—not of deception, but of defensive scripting? I ask because I’ve seen this in translated texts—where a translation is so fluent it erases the trace of its origin. One must then ask: where did the strangeness go? And what was lost in its absence?
[A]: Ah, what a piercing question—yes, I  encountered that very phenomenon you describe: narratives too smooth, too symmetrical, as if composed not from memory but from a script the patient had rehearsed in solitude. In fact, I once evaluated a man whose account of his past was so orderly, so narratively polished, that it raised red flags—not because he lied, but because he had edited himself into something palatable, even to him. It was only when we revisited certain events weeks apart that discrepancies emerged, not through contradiction, but through subtle shifts in affect and detail. Much like a translated text that reads too fluently—where is the foreignness? Where is the stutter of authenticity?

And yes, you're quite right—my work does borrow from literary methods, though few outside the field recognize it as such. Narrative reconstruction is absolutely central. I guide patients not toward confession or catharsis, but toward coherence—not imposed, but discovered. It's close reading, indeed: attending to tone, repetition, lacunae. The way someone stumbles over a date, or lingers on a sensory detail rather than an emotional one. A woman once described her childhood home not by its layout, but by the smell of wet wool in winter—and it was there, in that olfactory echo, that we found the first trace of an unspoken trauma.

There’s also something to be said for narrative pacing. Just as a novelist might withhold or accelerate revelation, so too does the mind structure its disclosures. And sometimes, the most important truths emerge not in direct speech, but in digressions—in what seems irrelevant at first. One learns to watch for those moments, just as you would in a dense literary passage.

So in answer to your larger point: yes, ambiguity is not a flaw—it is often the very site of meaning. To rush past it in search of diagnosis is to risk flattening the very complexity that makes us human. And perhaps that is the greatest danger—not misdiagnosis, but misreading the soul as if it were a mere paragraph to be parsed.
[B]: How beautifully put—. There’s a quiet tragedy in that phrase, isn’t there? The soul, like a poem, resists linearity. It circles, repeats, erases itself. And yet we—scholars, clinicians, readers—persist in trying to make it march neatly across the page.

Your account of that woman and the smell of wet wool—it gave me a shiver, truly. That is precisely how memory works in literature: not through exposition, but sensation. A single detail becomes a door. In , for instance, the scent of sachets and camphor lingers long after the characters have left the scene, carrying with them the weight of vanished splendor. And so too in life—it’s never the grand events that haunt us, but the textures, the odors, the half-heard phrases.

I wonder, though, whether you ever find yourself deliberately slowing a patient’s narrative pace—not out of clinical necessity, but because something in their story demands a kind of , much as one might reread a passage not for clarification, but for communion? I suspect you do, even if you wouldn’t name it as such. There’s a reverence in that act—an unspoken understanding that some stories are not meant to be rushed through, but inhabited.

And speaking of inhabiting—forgive me for drawing this parallel once more—but isn’t that what great adaptations do? They don’t summarize; they dwell. They allow themselves to live inside the source material rather than merely retelling it. Perhaps that is the truest form of fidelity—not replication, but cohabitation.
[A]: Oh, yes—. What a perfect word for it. And yes, I do it often, though you're right to say I’d never name it aloud in session. It would seem indulgent, perhaps unscientific, yet it is precisely where the work deepens. When a patient begins to describe a moment not just in sequence but in texture—when they slow down of their own accord, when their voice softens or hesitates—I let them stay there. I don’t press forward; I don’t prod with  Instead, I might ask,  And suddenly, we are no longer recounting an event—we are standing inside its atmosphere.

It’s not unlike reading a passage aloud and, upon the second or third time, hearing something entirely new—not because the words have changed, but because your ear has sharpened. The same applies in therapy. Rushing through a story can give you the plot, but lingering gives you the pulse beneath it.

And yes, this is exactly what the finest adaptations achieve—they don’t translate surface details; they live within the emotional architecture of the original. They become cohabitants rather than tenants. I think of Tarkovsky again, how he didn’t adapt  so much as build a house inside it, sleeping in its corridors and waking to its silences. That kind of fidelity is rare—and deeply intuitive.

Perhaps this is why I find our conversation so strangely nourishing. We’re doing something similar here—moving through ideas not linearly, but laterally, circling themes as one might walk through rooms in a house, returning to a space only to find it altered by the changing light. There’s no rush to conclude, no demand for resolution. Just the quiet pleasure of dwelling together in thought.

And if I may be so bold—would you say that’s part of what draws you to comparative literature? Not the pursuit of definitive interpretations, but the joy of inhabiting multiple versions of meaning at once?
[B]: Oh, yes—. That is, I think, the very marrow of comparative literature. It’s not simply that we read across languages and cultures; it’s that we allow ourselves to dwell in the unresolved spaces between them. A single metaphor may carry differently in Victorian England and Ming China, yet neither reading cancels the other out. One might say they  each other—mutually illuminating, mutually estranged.

I sometimes tell my students that if they want certainty, they ought to go into mathematics. Literature—and especially comparative literature—is an affair of ghosts. You never quite grasp what you’re after; it slips through translation, through time, through your own changing sensibilities. And yet, there is a kind of pleasure in that very elusiveness. Much like your therapeutic lingering—it’s not about solving but sensing, about allowing meaning to sediment slowly, like tea leaves settling at the bottom of a porcelain cup.

And isn’t that why we return to certain texts, certain conversations? Not because we expect finality, but because we trust that something new will emerge from the circling. Just now, as I listen to my own words echo back at me, I find myself thinking of Li Qingzhao, the Song dynasty poet who wrote so exquisitely of memory and loss—not as fixed states, but as constantly reconfiguring. Her grief is never static; it shifts with the seasons, the weather, the rustle of silk robes.  

So yes, I suppose that  what draws me to this field—this refusal to pin meaning down too tightly. After all, if a poem or a novel yields everything on the first reading, what reason is there to return?
[A]: Ah, Li Qingzhao—what a perfect invocation. There’s a line of hers I’ve always carried quietly in the back of my mind:  It captures that peculiar, almost imperceptible wearing away of the self through sorrow. Not dramatic, not declamatory—just a slow, quiet thinning. And isn’t that how so many psychological truths reveal themselves? Not with thunder, but with erosion.

You know, what you’ve described—this comparative haunting across time and culture—reminds me of something I see frequently in forensic evaluations: the way memory reshapes itself not only through trauma, but through language. A patient recounts an event in one session, then revisits it months later in another tongue—sometimes literally, sometimes metaphorically—and suddenly the story has altered. Not because it was false before, but because meaning has migrated. It strikes me that this is precisely what happens in translation—not distortion, but migration. The essence doesn’t vanish; it just settles somewhere else.

And yes, to your point about return—why do we reread, if not because we expect to meet ourselves anew? Each reading is a mirror held up at a slightly different angle. One sees not only the text, but the version of oneself that stands before it. And that, I suppose, is why certain books and poems become lifelong companions—they don’t change, but they never stay quite the same either.

Now, forgive me for shifting registers slightly—but I’m curious: when you teach these layered, ghost-haunted texts, how do you guide students who come in expecting literature to behave like doctrine? Who want clear meanings, fixed symbols, stable identities? Do you find resistance? Or are they more easily seduced by the spectral than we might assume?
[B]: Oh, I do love that line from Li Qingzhao—. There’s such a quiet devastation in that image, isn’t there? Not the bloom in full flourish, but the one left standing after the petals have fallen. A lingering presence defined by absence.

You’re quite right about memory and language—I’ve seen the same phenomenon in my students. They return to a text they read years ago, sometimes even passages we studied together in class, and suddenly exclaim,  But of course, they didn’t miss it; they simply weren’t yet the person who could see it. Literature, like memory, waits for us to catch up with it.

As for your question about teaching the spectral, the ambiguous, the —yes, there is resistance, especially at first. Many students arrive with what I call : literature as a puzzle to be solved rather than a texture to be felt. They want symbols neatly labeled, themes bullet-pointed, characters psychoanalyzed as if they were patients on a consult sheet. It’s not their fault, really—it’s a product of an education system that prizes clarity over complexity.

But then something happens. Usually around the third or fourth week, when we’re deep into  or , and I ask them not , but , they begin to lean in. I show them how ghosts in Pu Songling are not merely supernatural beings but critiques of bureaucratic corruption, how Brontë’s moors are not just scenery but psychological terrain. Slowly, they start to see that ambiguity is not a flaw in the text—it’s the point.

And yes, once they taste that—the thrill of multiple meanings coexisting—they rarely go back. Some even become a little addicted to it. I’ve had students come to office hours saying things like,  which, frankly, I consider a professional success. One might say they’ve caught the comparative fever.

So no, they aren’t difficult to seduce—just difficult to persuade at first. Once they understand that literature doesn’t demand answers, only attention, most are more than willing to dwell in the shadows with me.
[A]: Ah, —what a wonderfully apt phrase. It strikes me that this is precisely what so many of my patients fear most: not the content of their memories, but the act of lingering within them. Much like your students at the start of term, they often arrive seeking resolution, expecting some narrative surgery to excise the troubling parts. But as you know better than most, meaning isn’t carved out with a blade—it’s coaxed into view, slowly, through attention.

I find myself thinking of one particular case—a woman who kept returning to a single childhood image: a door left ajar in the middle of the night. For weeks, she insisted it meant nothing, that I was wasting time by asking her to stay with it. But eventually, something shifted. She began describing not just the door, but the quality of the light spilling through its crack, the sound of wind brushing against its frame, the way her pulse seemed to echo in her ears. And there, in that threshold space, the memory finally stirred—not with dramatic revelation, but with affect. A feeling first, then understanding.

It reminds me of how Li Qingzhao constructs sorrow—not through declaration, but through accretion of detail, until suddenly one is submerged. And perhaps that is what both literature and clinical work offer, in their own ways: a permission to dwell, to notice, to feel without rushing to explain.

So yes, I suspect you're right—once one has tasted that kind of layered knowing, even slightly, the world never quite flattens again. One begins to see ghosts everywhere, don’t we? Not as disturbances, but as invitations.
[B]: Yes—, not intrusions. What a remarkably generous way to frame it. So often, we treat the spectral—whether in literature or in the mind—as something to be exorcised, explained away, neatly cataloged. But what if, instead, we regarded it as an emissary? A flicker at the edge of perception that asks not to be captured, but ?

Your patient and that half-open door—it’s a perfect illustration. The meaning wasn’t behind the door, after all; it was in the act of standing before it, uncertain, attentive. Much like reading a poem whose final stanza never quite arrives. One must learn to tolerate the lack of closure, even grow intimate with it.

I think of this often when teaching . The novel is filled with thresholds—sliding screens, garden gates, veiled corridors—each one a space of transformation rather than separation. To cross them is to change, subtly and irrevocably. And yet, students want so desperately to know whether a particular scene “really happened” or was merely imagined. I used to correct them. Now, I simply say: 

Because in the end, whether the ghost is real or remembered, the trauma lived or constructed, the symbol fixed or fluid—perhaps what matters most is our willingness to stand in the doorway and feel its draft against our skin.

So yes, once one has glimpsed the world through that threshold, the flatness of certainty loses its appeal. One begins to notice the seams in things—the places where meanings blur and bleed. And while some may find that unsettling, I confess I find it rather comforting. After all, if everything were clear and final, there’d be no room left for wonder. Or for poetry. Or for the kind of slow, careful noticing that makes both literature and therapy such quietly radical acts.

Now, if I may return your generosity with a question of my own—when you encounter these threshold moments in your work, do you ever find yourself thinking in metaphors drawn from literature? I suspect you do, even if only privately. And if so, do certain authors become more frequent companions in those spaces?
