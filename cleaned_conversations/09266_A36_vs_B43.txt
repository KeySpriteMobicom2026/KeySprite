[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到board game，这让我想起前两天在系里的文化交流沙龙上，有位研究西方文化的学者提到，board game其实和文学文本有很多相似之处——它们都构建了一套规则与叙事的框架。不过说到尝试new games，我最近倒是陪我的研究生们玩了几局《卡坦岛》...说实话，比起传统棋类，这种现代桌游的随机性机制很有意思，有点像文学中的intertextuality，你永远不知道下一张牌会带来怎样的interconnection。

我记得以前在剑桥访学时，常和同事在common room玩《文明》的board game版。现在回想起来，那种需要同时考虑long-term strategy和immediate tactics的感觉，还挺像我们做比较文学时要在不同文化语境中找到balance point的。你最近有接触什么特别的游戏吗？
[A]: Oh, what a fascinating way to look at board games—drawing parallels between narrative frameworks in literature and gameplay mechanics! It really does mirror how we engage with stories, just with more dice rolling involved.  

As for me, I recently introduced a group of guests to —a beautifully designed game about building bird habitats. It’s surprisingly strategic, yet peaceful, and I loved seeing their personalities come through as they chose which birds to attract. One guest even remarked how it felt like reading a quiet, character-driven novel—one where every choice subtly shapes the story.  

It reminded me a bit of my own evenings curled up with a classic novel by the fireplace... though I suppose not everyone would find avian strategy quite as thrilling as Tolstoy! Still, it’s amazing how games can spark conversations—and sometimes even friendships. Have you found that too?
[B]: Ah, ... what a lovely metaphor you used—character-driven gameplay indeed resonates with the subtleties of a well-crafted novel. I can imagine how each player’s choice reflects their inner landscape; much like how readers bring their own interpretations to a text. The tranquility of that game is quite poetic, isn’t it? Almost like walking through a haiku—measured, intentional, yet flowing.

You know, I once had a student who likened the act of building a bird habitat to constructing a literary theme—each layer adding depth, context, and resonance. And yes, I’ve seen friendships bloom over such games. Just last week, a few colleagues and I played an old favorite, , and it was fascinating how our strategic alliances and sudden betrayals mirrored the dynamics of literary schools in conflict—Romanticism vs. Realism, perhaps? 😊

I suppose not everyone sees the thrill in Tolstoy either—at least not at first—but sometimes all it takes is the right context to spark that appreciation. Games, in their way, offer such contexts—playful, engaging, yet deeply reflective. Have you ever tried blending literature with gameplay, maybe through narrative-driven games or story-based expansions?
[A]: Oh, I love that comparison— as a haiku of gameplay. It really does encourage a kind of mindful engagement, doesn’t it? I’ll have to remember that—perhaps suggest it to guests who enjoy a bit of poetry with their afternoon tea.

You’re absolutely right about how games can mirror literary dynamics. I’ve always thought  had a wonderfully dramatic ebb and flow—like watching a historical epic unfold over the course of an hour. And yes, I’ve dabbled in narrative-driven games; one of my personal favourites is . It’s a remarkable blend of strategy and storytelling—each decision feels weighty, almost like choosing the direction of a novel’s plot.  

In fact, I hosted a book club here at the hotel last month where we played  edition of . It was such a delight seeing literature and deduction puzzles come together so seamlessly. Have you ever tried something like that—pairing a game night with a specific literary theme?
[B]: What a delightful fusion—Sherlock Holmes and deduction games! I can almost picture the gaslight flickering over the players, their brows furrowed in concentration as they piece together clues. It reminds me of those late-night seminars where we’d debate the finer points of  while sipping jasmine tea. There’s something deeply satisfying about engaging with narrative through multiple layers—text, discussion, and now, gameplay.

Now that you mention it, I did organize a themed evening some years ago— meets . We adapted certain elements of the novel into the game mechanics—players had to collect sutras instead of artifacts, and each character embodied one of the pilgrims’ traits: wit, discipline, strength, and a touch of mischief 😊. It was an experiment, really—an attempt to get my students to experience the journey rather than simply analyze it.

As for , I’ve heard quite a bit about its narrative depth from a former student who’s now a game designer. He once described it as “a Dickensian saga where your choices write themselves into the world’s fabric.” I must admit, it sounds like the kind of immersive storytelling I appreciate in literature. Perhaps it’s time I gave it a try—though I suspect I’ll be lost without a good cup of oolong and a notebook for taking thematic notes. 📝🍵

Have you considered trying something with Eastern mythological motifs? Or perhaps a game inspired by classical Chinese literature? I’d be happy to suggest a few if you’re interested.
[A]: That sounds absolutely enchanting— woven into ? What a brilliant way to bring myth and mechanics together. I can just imagine the conversations that must have sparked to life around that table—part adventure, part literary reflection. Truly inspiring!

I’d love to explore more games rooted in Eastern mythology, yes. While I’ve come across a few—like , which beautifully captures the elegance of strategic thought—I feel there’s so much untapped richness in classical Chinese literature that could translate wonderfully into gameplay.  

In fact, I recently stumbled upon a small press reprint of  illustrated by an independent artist—so vivid, so full of symbolism. It made me wonder if there’s a board game out there that captures the episodic nature of that epic, where players navigate trials, temptations, and transformations. If you have any recommendations, I’d be most grateful!  

And please—do share your thoughts on how literature and games continue to shape one another. There’s something rather comforting about the idea that storytelling evolves, yet retains its soul.
[B]: What a thoughtful reflection—you're quite right that storytelling, in whatever form, carries with it a kind of enduring soul. I often tell my students that narrative is like water—it adapts to its container, yet remains essentially itself. Whether through the oral traditions of ancient China, the printed novel, or the interactive board game, the essence of journeying with a story persists.

Now, regarding games inspired by Eastern mythology and classical Chinese literature—yes, there are a few hidden gems out there, though admittedly not as many as one would hope given the depth of our literary heritage. , as you mentioned, is a fine example of distilled strategy rooted in Eastern philosophy—almost like a haiku made tangible through movement and pattern. But if you’re looking for something more explicitly tied to , I’d recommend seeking out a game called . It’s an indie-designed cooperative game where players take on roles from the pilgrimage and must navigate trials using symbolic artifacts—very much in the spirit of the original tale, though still relatively niche.

There’s also a beautifully illustrated French-Chinese co-production titled , which captures the episodic nature of the journey quite well. Each player builds their own spiritual path, encounters demons, and faces moral dilemmas—not unlike reading a chapter in the original epic. While it leans toward the lighter side in terms of mechanics, it offers a rich thematic experience.

As for your broader question about how literature and games shape one another—well, I could talk about this for hours over a pot of tea 😊. In essence, I believe both forms invite us into a space of participation. A novel asks us to imagine; a game asks us to act. And when they meet—as in story-driven RPGs or narrative-rich board games—they offer a uniquely immersive dialogue between reader and world. Perhaps this is why myths endure so vividly in gameplay—they were always meant to be lived, not just read.

Tell me—have you ever thought of designing your own literary-themed game? I suspect someone with your sensibility for atmosphere and narrative nuance would create something quite extraordinary.
[A]: What a truly generous thought—thank you. The idea of designing a literary-themed game is something I’ve often mused over during quiet evenings by the fireplace, a cup of chamomile in hand and a well-worn novel on my lap. I think what draws me most is the idea of atmosphere—the way a story lingers not just in the mind, but in the space around you. Imagine a game where each turn feels like turning the page of a Brontë novel: mist rolling across the moors, footsteps echoing just beyond sight, choices whispered rather than declared.

I’ve even scribbled a few ideas into a leather-bound notebook I keep for such musings—nothing formal, just fragments. One concept revolves around , where players navigate tangled relationships and shifting loyalties through hidden objectives and uneasy alliances. Another is inspired by , focusing on fleeting beauty, seasonal change, and the quiet power of correspondence. Of course, these are early thoughts—like ink still drying on parchment—but there’s a certain thrill in imagining how literature might breathe through gameplay.

And now, thanks to our conversation, I find myself quite taken with the idea of exploring more Eastern mythological motifs—perhaps something drawn from , where the line between the human and the supernatural blurs ever so slightly. After all, isn’t that what both literature and games do best? They invite us into liminal spaces, where stories wait patiently to be told—and retold.
[B]: What a beautiful vision—you truly have an ear for atmosphere, the kind that lingers like the scent of old books in a sunlit study. I can almost hear the wind through the heather as you speak, and I must say, your concept for a  game strikes a particular chord. The idea of uneasy alliances and hidden objectives is so very Brontë—after all, isn’t that exactly what Wuthering Heights itself is filled with? Secrets layered like dust on a forgotten letter, and emotions simmering just beneath the surface.

Your  idea is equally captivating. It makes me think of how Japanese aesthetics value —the gentle sadness that comes from recognizing impermanence. A game built around seasonal change and ephemeral beauty would be a quiet masterpiece, wouldn’t it? Perhaps players could send poems to one another as part of the mechanics, with subtle shifts in meaning depending on the season or the relationship between characters. Imagine how that might mirror the emotional economy of the novel itself.

As for , now you’re speaking to my heart’s secret garden 😊. There’s such haunting beauty in those tales—the way the supernatural drifts into daily life like incense smoke curling through a window. I once taught a comparative seminar where we read Pu Songling alongside Poe and M.R. James, and the students were struck by how the Chinese stories often leave ambiguity hanging in the air, unresolved. That, I think, could make for a wonderful mechanic: not knowing whether the spirit at your side is friend or foe, or whether your own actions are drawing you toward enlightenment or illusion.

Perhaps one day, if you ever decide to bring your ideas to life, I’d be honored to lend a hand with the literary framework—or at least test a prototype over tea. After all, what better way to spend an afternoon than wandering the threshold between story and play?
[A]: What a kind and thoughtful response—thank you. You have such a way with words, like a gentle wind stirring the pages of an open book. I can already picture that seminar room of yours—warm lamplight, well-worn copies of Pu Songling and Poe side by side, students leaning in as if the stories might whisper secrets back to them.

You’re absolutely right about —that quiet reverence for the fleeting is so intrinsic to , and it would be a beautiful heartbeat for a game. I love your idea of exchanging poems; perhaps players could use seasonal imagery as currency, subtly influencing one another’s reputations or affections. A plum blossom in spring might signify hope, while a maple leaf in autumn could hint at waning devotion. The poetry itself could shape alliances or create quiet ruptures—just as delicate as ink on rice paper.

And oh, what a delight it would be to have you involved in any literary game design! I can already imagine us over tea, discussing which narrative threads to weave into mechanics, debating whether a particular mechanic captures the brooding tension of Wuthering Heights or the ethereal melancholy of . Testing prototypes, adjusting themes—it would be like curating a library of living stories.

I do hope we cross paths in person someday. I’d love to welcome you here at the hotel—I know you’d appreciate the garden in late afternoon light, and I’d be thrilled to hear more of your thoughts over a pot of oolong or lapsang souchong. Until then, shall we keep this conversation going? Perhaps explore other literary worlds ripe for transformation into play?
[B]: What a gracious and poetic vision you paint—thank you. There’s something deeply comforting in the thought of shared quietude over books and tea, isn’t there? It reminds me of a line from —something about how even chance meetings are the result of long-forgotten vows. I daresay our conversation feels a little like that.

I would be absolutely delighted to continue exploring literary worlds with you—after all, what better company than one who understands that stories are never truly finished, only reimagined? Speaking of which, have you ever considered  as more than just a thematic backdrop for games? At its core, it's a tale of transformation through trial, of enlightenment pursued not in grand gestures but through countless small victories. Imagine a game where players begin with rigid roles—monk, disciple, demon—and gradually shed those identities through play, evolving not in power, but in understanding. No final boss, only inner change. That, to me, would be a revolutionary kind of gameplay—one where winning means becoming someone new.

Or perhaps we might look to , with its intricate dance of loyalty, ambition, and fate. A game of shifting allegiances, where trust is both currency and vulnerability. Players could be forced to make Sun Tzu-like choices: when to strike, when to yield, and when to simply wait, like a general watching the fog lift at dawn.

And then… there is always poetry. Have you ever imagined a game based not on conflict, but on the rhythm of classical verse? Something where each move must echo the structure of a regulated quatrain, where balance and restraint are not limitations, but strengths? I find myself quite taken with the idea now—perhaps we could sketch out a simple prototype in words, right here, over this virtual cup of tea?

Please, tell me—what literary world calls to you next?
[A]: Oh, what a breathtaking thought—that  could inspire a game not of conquest or collection, but of quiet transformation. How beautifully you put it: winning not by defeating an enemy, but by becoming someone wiser, freer. It feels so very much in line with the spirit of the text—those long, winding trials that shape the soul more than the body. I imagine players beginning with fixed roles and gradually unlocking choices that defy their original nature—perhaps a once-arrogant disciple must choose mercy over might, or a stubborn monk must learn to listen to the wisdom of those he once dismissed.

And —ah, now there’s a world of strategy and sorrow. The idea of trust as both currency and vulnerability is exquisite. I can already see players seated around a lacquered board, candlelight flickering, each move carrying the weight of history and human frailty. A betrayal would feel less like a tactic and more like a stanza from a tragic ballad—inevitable, yet still heartbreaking.

As for poetry… how utterly enchanting. A game where every move must follow the rhythm of regulated verse? It sounds like a dance of the mind and heart, where elegance triumphs over force. I love the notion of balance and restraint as strengths—how unlike so many games we see today, which prize dominance. In this one, perhaps players construct verses together, building meaning through choice of word and tone. Each tile placed could be a syllable, each completed couplet a victory of harmony over chaos.

You’ve stirred something in me—I think I’d like to explore  next. There’s such richness in its domestic drama, its quiet unraveling of fortune and feeling. Picture a game where players manage relationships within a grand estate, where a misplaced glance or a well-timed poem can shift the course of a family’s fate. No battles, only emotional currents—like watching silk unfurl in water.

But I’m curious—what do you think our first prototype should look like? Shall we begin with a simple framework for that poetic game you mentioned? I have a pen ready and a fresh page in my notebook… and all the time in the world for a story waiting to be shaped.
[B]: What a wonderful invitation—thank you. I can almost see that fresh page, waiting patiently for ink to bring it to life. And yes, let’s begin with the poetic game. Let us call it, for now, —a title that carries just enough stillness and reflection.

Here’s an opening thought for our framework:  
Imagine a shared poem-in-progress, unfolding over the course of the game like morning mist giving way to light. Each player contributes lines in turn, drawing from a limited set of syllabic tiles—perhaps each tile representing a single character or image (e.g., 梅 – plum blossom, 雨 – rain, 窗 – window). The structure could loosely follow the form of a  (近体诗), where tonal balance and parallelism are essential—not unlike weaving harmony into chaos.

Players would earn points not through conquest, but through resonance. A line that echoes a previous image gains strength; a couplet that captures seasonal change or emotional depth earns quiet applause from the group. But there is also risk: if a line breaks the rhythm too severely, or disrupts the flow of meaning, it might cost the player influence—or even shift the tone of the entire poem.

Each round, players could choose one of three actions:
1. Add a line to the poem, using their tiles.
2. Echo a previous line, reinforcing its presence and gaining thematic credit.
3. Shift the mood, introducing a new emotional or seasonal motif—though this must be done carefully, lest it unravel what came before.

The goal wouldn’t be to win outright, but to guide the poem toward a meaningful close—to leave behind something whole, even if fleeting. Much like the gatherings at Orchid Pavilion, where scholars once composed verses together beneath spring skies.

What do you think? Does this feel like a shape worth filling with ink and imagination? Or shall we adjust the meter before setting our first line?
[A]: Oh, —what a name to linger on the tongue, like the last note of a guqin melody. I can already feel the hush that surrounds it, the kind of silence that waits just before poetry begins. You’ve given it such a graceful structure, too—balanced yet fluid, like ink brushed across silk.

I love the idea of resonance as currency, of harmony as victory. It feels so rare in modern games, where tension is often born of conflict rather than rhythm. And your three actions—add, echo, shift—oh, they’re so very poetic in themselves. They remind me of how we read: sometimes we introduce new ideas, sometimes we return to what’s familiar, and sometimes we allow the mood to change, quietly, almost imperceptibly.

Perhaps we might add a subtle mechanic that reflects the Chinese concept of  (意境)—the interplay between image and emotion. Each player could carry a small set of “mood tokens” representing elements like solitude, longing, joy, or stillness. When placing a line, they might choose to reveal a token to subtly steer the tone, but overuse could tip the balance too far, making the poem feel forced rather than felt.

And I wonder—might there be a seasonal wheel? A progression from spring’s budding hope to winter’s quiet retreat? Players could draw from different tile sets depending on the season, gently nudging the poem through time. As the cycle turns, perhaps certain images gain or lose meaning—a plum blossom in spring is promise; in winter, endurance.

I find myself quite swept up in this. Shall we try drafting a sample round? Just here, with words alone? I’ll begin:

---

Round One  
Season: Early Spring  
Tiles Available: 柳絮 (willow fluff), 窗纱 (window gauze), 微雨 (drizzle)  

Player One plays:  
柳絮轻沾窗下纱  
(Willow fluff lightly clings to gauze at the window)

---

Would you like to take the next turn? Or shall we refine this framework further before setting brush to parchment?
[B]: 柳絮轻沾窗下纱… what a delicate opening—so soft, yet already heavy with implication. The willow fluff lingers, not quite settling, much like thought upon waking. I can feel the season breathing through that gauze, as if the world outside is still wrapped in gentle sleep.

Let me respond with a line that echoes your image while nudging the mood slightly toward quiet longing—a subtle turn of .  

---

Player Two plays:  
微雨暗添帘外影  
(Drizzle quietly deepens the shadow beyond the curtain)

---

Ah, don’t you feel the space between those two lines? It’s barely there, but already a story begins to stir. The willow fluff and drizzle are not just weather—they’re emotion falling lightly upon the scene. I wonder—would Player One now choose to echo one of these motifs, or gently shift the tone?

Or perhaps we might pause here for a moment and consider the evolving balance. If we were playing with mood tokens, you could begin to see how  has crept in softly beneath the fabric of the poem, aided by that curtain-shadow motif. And yet, it’s not overpowering—it's more of a whisper than a declaration.

Shall we continue drafting this round together, or would you prefer to step back and refine our framework a little more before we proceed further? After all, even the finest brushwork begins with careful preparation.
[A]: Oh, I feel it too—the space between those lines is like the pause before a sigh, where everything unspoken lingers. You’ve added such a gentle but resonant depth with . The curtain becomes a threshold between inner world and outer scene, doesn’t it? And that shadow beyond—it’s not quite loneliness, but a kind of tender awareness, as if the poem itself is beginning to breathe.

I’d love to continue drafting this round just a little further—I think we’re onto something quite delicate here. Let’s see how Player One might respond. Perhaps they choose to echo your motif of shadow and depth, reinforcing the mood subtly.

---

Player One echoes:  
帘影轻摇旧梦斜  
(The curtain’s shadow sways, tilting gently toward old dreams)

---

Ah, there it is—the first real suggestion of memory, of something lingering beneath the present moment. That  leaning into the light… it adds such warmth to the cool imagery already in place.

Now, if we were playing with mood tokens, I imagine Player One might place a small  token beside their line—nothing overt, just enough to suggest that emotional current is deepening.

Would you like to continue as Player Two—perhaps shifting the season slightly, or introducing a new image to see how the poem might evolve further? Or shall we step back for a moment and consider how scoring might take shape within this evolving atmosphere?
[B]: 帘影轻摇旧梦斜… what a lovely echo, almost like a sigh settling into the fabric of the room. There’s such grace in how you’ve let that curtain carry memory—fluttering just slightly, like a page turned in a forgotten diary.

I shall continue as Player Two, and with this next line, I’d like to gently shift the season forward—stepping into , where warmth begins to coax things into fuller bloom. Let us see if we can weave a quiet transition from dreaming into waking.

---

Player Two shifts:  
风开半卷寻花信  
(The breeze half-unfurls the scroll, seeking news of blossoms)

---

Here, the tone brightens ever so slightly—the wind carries intention now, not just mood. The poem stirs from reverie toward expectation. Perhaps a bud is forming, or a letter awaits reply. And isn’t that the beauty of mid-spring? Everything is on the verge, but nothing yet has chosen its shape.

Would you like to continue building this round, or would now be a good moment to step back and begin sketching out how scoring might work within our framework? I find myself quite eager to see how we might quantify resonance without breaking the poem’s spell.
[A]: Oh, what a lovely turn—the breeze stirs not just the air, but possibility itself.  carries such gentle anticipation, like a hand hovering just above a琴弦 before the first note is struck. The poem is beginning to bloom, and I do believe we’ve reached a perfect moment to pause and consider how we might measure resonance without disturbing its quiet grace.

Let’s imagine how scoring could work in . Since our goal is harmony rather than competition, perhaps points are more like ripples—subtle indicators of how deeply a line has touched the evolving whole. Here’s a thought:

---

### Scoring Framework (Preliminary)  
1. Echo Points – When a player successfully echoes an earlier image or motif (e.g., curtain, willow fluff, shadow), they earn 1 point per direct connection. Subtle allusions earn 2 points; overt repetition earns none.  
   > Example: A line referencing blossoms would subtly echo the willow fluff from the opening.

2. Mood Resonance – If a line clearly reinforces or deepens the established emotional tone (longing, solitude, joy, etc.), players may place a matching mood token and gain 1 point. Overuse (more than two tokens on consecutive lines) disrupts balance and costs 1 point.

3. Seasonal Shift Bonus – A player who introduces a smooth and evocative shift in season gains 2 points, provided the new imagery blends naturally with what came before.

4. Couplet Harmony – When two consecutive lines form a structurally or thematically coherent couplet, both players receive 2 points. Forced pairings—those lacking tonal or thematic balance—lose 1 point each.

5. Final Line Grace – The player who places the closing line earns 2 points only if the group agrees it offers a sense of completion—a final brushstroke that neither overreaches nor retreats.

---

Now, applying this to our current exchange:

- Player One’s  starts us with no points, as there’s nothing yet to echo.
- Player Two’s  earns 1 point for introducing the curtain motif.
- Player One’s echo in  gains 1 point for reinforcing the curtain image, plus 1 point for mood resonance (longing).
- Player Two’s  earns 2 points: 1 for seasonal shift (early to mid-spring), and 1 for introducing a new but harmonious motif (breeze and blossoms).

Would you agree with this reading? Or would you adjust the weight of any of these elements to better preserve the poetic flow while still offering meaningful structure?

And if we were to continue drafting, might we begin to feel the shape of the closing line?
[B]: Ah, what a graceful framework you've sketched—measured yet fluid, like ink bleeding ever so slightly into the grain of fine paper. I very much agree with your reading of the lines thus far; the scoring feels like a quiet pulse beneath the poem’s skin, present but not intrusive.

I would only suggest one gentle refinement: perhaps for Echo Points, we allow 1 point for subtle allusion and 2 points for layered resonance—where a player not only echoes an image but  it slightly, giving it new meaning in the process. For instance, if someone were to return to the willow fluff but now describe it as having lifted again, carried by the breeze toward something unseen—then we might consider that a deeper poetic gesture.

As for our current draft, I find myself quite taken with how the poem is unfolding. The mood has shifted from quiet observation to a kind of wistful anticipation—like sitting at a window just before tea grows cold, watching the world turn slowly outside.

Yes, let us begin to feel the shape of the closing line. I shall offer one that leans gently into completion without sealing the door too firmly:

---

Player Two closes (tentatively):  
墨痕犹湿待归鸿  
(The ink stain still wet, awaiting the returning goose)

---

This, I think, brings us back to the idea of writing and waiting—a letter half-written, or a poem unfinished until a friend answers it. It echoes solitude and hope in equal measure, don’t you think?

Now, if this felt like a natural conclusion to you, then Player Two would earn Final Line Grace—but only if you, as Player One, felt it offered a sense of wholehearted closure. Would you agree? Or might you prefer to extend the poem just a little longer, letting the ink run a bit further?

And if we are near its end, might we now test another round together, using this refined framework as our guide?
