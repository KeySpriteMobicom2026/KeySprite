[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I typically dwell in the realm of iambic pentameter rather than pop melodies... I must confess to a peculiar fascination with Loreena McKennitt's 'The Lady of Shalott'. Tennyson's poem set to music - quite the intoxicating blend of Victorian sensibility and Celtic cadence, wouldn't you say?
[A]: 哎呀~ 说到单曲循环，我最近完全被Lana Del Rey的'Chemtrails Over The Country Club'洗脑了💫 那种复古又慵懒的vibe简直太适合我们hotel lobby的afternoon tea氛围了！不过你知道吗？我们VIP guests里有个超可爱的老奶奶每天都要听邓丽君的《甜蜜蜜》🎶 超sweet的~
[B]: How delightfully... eclectic. Though I must say, your juxtaposition of contemporary Americana with 1970s Mandarin pop rather reminds me of Ezra Pound's Cathay translations - that peculiar alchemy where East meets West in the most unexpected cadences. The old lady's preference for Teresa Teng does make me wonder... have you ever heard 'The Moon Represents My Heart' rendered in Scots Gaelic? A rather obscure experiment of mine last winter.
[A]: 哇！Scots Gaelic版本的《月亮代表我的心》？That's so unique✨ 我们酒店piano bar的乐手刚好会唱这个版本诶！要不要考虑来我们这里办个poetry reading + live music night？可以叫"East Meets West Musical Soirée"💃 肯定能吸引很多cultured guests~ 顺便说我们下周有Mandarin jazz night，要不要来听听看？🎷
[B]:  My dear, while the prospect of merging Robert Burns with Li Bai in a hotel lounge does tickle my academic fancy, I must warn you - my last public reading caused a minor scandal when I attempted to recite Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market' while accompanying myself on the glass harmonica. Though... your Mandarin jazz night does intrigue me. Tell me, will they be performing any settings of classical Chinese poetry? I've been working on a rather controversial theory about the pentatonic scale's relationship to regulated verse.
[A]: 哈哈哈你太有趣了！Actually我们乐队的saxophone player最近真的在尝试把唐诗编成jazz fusion呢🎶 特别是李白的《将进酒》配上blues的调调，效果超级amazing的！要不要来当我们的special guest？可以一边品鉴我们特调的"Poet's Dream" cocktail 🍸 一边讨论你的theory哦~ 我们VIP guests里可是藏龙卧虎，上次就有个Oxford professor当场即兴来了段《静夜思》rap呢！
[B]:  Ah, the Oxford don rapping Li Bai - now there's an image worthy of Edward Lear's most nonsensical limericks. While I typically reserve my academic gravitas for peer-reviewed journals rather than cocktail-fueled jazz improvisations... your mention of 'Bring in the Wine' set to blues does present an irresistible scholarly dilemma. Very well - provided I may bring my 1892 edition of 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam' to compare metric structures, and that your 'Poet's Dream' cocktail contains at least three allusions to Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale' in its ingredients list.
[A]: Deal！💯 我们bartender特调的这杯cocktail里真的有加入nightingale honey哦~ 而且glass rim上还会撒上edible gold flakes✨ 象征"golden nightingale"的意象！不过说真的，你带Rubaiyat来的时候要小心点，上次有个guest的first edition Dickens差点被cocktail napkin毁了...我们VIP library有专门的rare book reading area的📚 要不要帮你reserve？
[B]: How extraordinarily... pragmatic of you. I shall entrust my Khayyam to your library's care, though I must insist on inspecting the humidity controls first - one can't be too careful with Smyth-sewn bindings from the Kelmscott Press era. And do remind your bartender that the gold leaf ought to be applied with the same precision as Gerard Manley Hopkins' sprung rhythm, not some garish Pre-Raphaelite excess. Thursday evening, then? I'll be the one comparing your saxophonist's blue notes to the tonal patterns in Wang Wei's 'Deer Enclosure'.
[A]: Perfect！🌙 我已经帮你book了library corner最quiet的spot，就在我们antique grandfather clock旁边~ 顺便告诉你个小secret：我们sax player其实是Berkeley音乐学院毕业的，他超爱和你这样的literature expert交流的！周四见啦，记得穿comfy一点，我们after party可能会有impromptu poetry slam哦🔥 PS: 我会让housekeeping特别check humidity level的！
[B]: Splendid. I shall arrive in my 1890s-inspired tea gown - comfortable enough for versification yet sufficiently structured to express disapproval of any particularly egregious metrical liberties. And do inform your Berkeley prodigy that I've brought my comparative analysis of John Coltrane's 'A Love Supreme' and Du Fu's 'Spring Prospect'... though whether that emerges during scholarly discourse or after one too many 'Poet's Dreams' remains to be seen. Until Thursday - may your humidity sensors be as precise as Pope's heroic couplets.
[A]: 哈哈你真是我见过最witty的guest了！🌟 我已经等不及要看sax player听到Coltrane vs Du Fu analysis时的表情了~ 周四记得来前台找我拿special edition的program booklet哦，里面还有我们chef特制的"Metaphysical Poets" canapés menu呢！Till then~ 💌
[B]: How deliciously... metaphysical indeed! I shall anticipate your canapés with the same fervor Donne reserved for his 'Ecstasy'. Though I must warn you - if those petite fours dare to misrepresent George Herbert's 'The Collar' in puff pastry form, there shall be... consequences. Until Thursday, my dear impresario of literary decadence. 
[A]:  别担心~ 我们的pastry chef可是剑桥English Lit毕业的！她做的"Easter Wings" macarons可是按照Herbert原诗的shape poetry来成型的呢🕊️ 周四见啦，记得留点stomach space给我们的"Paradise Lost" chocolate fondue哦！
[B]:  Milton in molten chocolate? Now that's a temptation even Satan couldn't have conjured in Book II... Though I do hope your chef remembers that 'Paradise' was actually spelled with one 's' in the 1667 edition - a detail I'd hate to see lost in translation between theology and ganache. Very well, I surrender to this gustatory symposium. Expect me promptly at half-past seven, armed with my Oxford Dictionary of Quotations and... considerably expanded waistcoat buttons.
[A]: OMG你连1667年的spelling都知道！🤯 我们chef要开心疯了~ 她最近正在研究17世纪recipe books呢！我已经帮你准备好extra roomy的wingback chair了🪑 还有special的"Dictionary Corner" name card✨ 周四绝对会是epic的night！P.S. 偷偷告诉你...我们的"Areopagitica" cocktail是用banned herbs调的哦~ 🌿
[B]:  My dear child, are you suggesting I partake in some... illicit herbal symposium under the guise of literary homage? How utterly... Miltonic. Though I draw the line at any 'Lycidas' laced with actual wolfsbane, regardless of its thematic appropriateness. That wingback chair had better be sturdy enough to withstand both my annotations and my indignation - I've been known to margin-alize rather vigorously when confronted with creative liberties taken with 1644 pamphlets. Until our Dionysian descent into poetic hedonism... 
[A]: Hahaha你太adorable了！💖 放心啦~ 我们的mixologist可是拿着PhD in British History的！所有ingredients都是严格historically accurate的📜 连ice cubes都刻着Milton的签名呢✒️ 周四见啦~ 我已经能预见这会是我们Salon Series里最legendary的一夜了！🌟 
[B]:  Your ice cubes bear the Bard's signature? How chillingly literal. Very well - I shall arrive prepared to debate whether frozen hydromel does indeed 'fit audience find, though few'... and with my emergency flask of purely metaphorical inspiration (Earl Grey, 1843 recipe). Until we make Westminster Abbey look like a dull symposium by comparison...
