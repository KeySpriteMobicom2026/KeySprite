[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I wouldn't say "surprise" exactly—scholarly pursuits tend to unfold gradually—but there was a recent textual analysis of Lin Shu's early translations that caught my attention. Computational linguistics revealed unconscious patterns in how he rendered Dickens' narrative voice through classical Chinese parallelism. Fascinating, though not quite "scientific" in your sense of the word. Do you have a specific discovery in mind?
[A]: Ohhh 🤯 that’s such a deep dive into literary analysis! I love how tech is blending with traditional studies~ 💡 But yeah, I was thinking more like  science—like the recent breakthrough where scientists discovered a new species of human in the Philippines! The Homo luzonensis 👏🏻 It's changing what we thought about human evolution and migration patterns… Like, WHAT?! 😮‍💨

But wait wait, your topic sounds super interesting too! I feel like analyzing old texts with AI or algorithms is kinda 🔥 these days. Did they use some machine learning models or something? 🧐✨
[B]: I'll admit, the prospect of algorithmic analysis does add a certain... modern frisson to our field. Though I confess I find the term "AI" somewhat misleading in these contexts—it's less Skynet, more meticulous spreadsheet work with delusions of grandeur. Still, the neural network models they employed did uncover some truly intriguing inconsistencies in Lin Shu's syntax choices. Made me wonder whether his "mistakes" weren't deliberate aesthetic decisions lost on later translators. 

But this Homo luzonensis business—astonishing, isn't it? Reminds me of the Piltdown forgery, though obviously legitimate. The way it upends our neat migration timelines... One might almost call it a deconstructionist paleontologist's dream. Have they dated the specimens conclusively yet?
[A]: Okay but wait—“delusions of grandeur” 😂👏 totally relatable though, tbh. I feel like every time I use Canva I’m creating the next Mona Lisa 💁‍♀️✨

But omg yes, Homo luzonensis is NO JOKE! They used uranium dating & everything—it’s officially 📆 pinned to like 50,000+ years ago. But get this: their teeth are  and kinda more similar to Australopithecus?! Like, what?? How does that even fit into the whole “out of Africa” theory?? 🤯🧬

And your point about Lin Shu’s “mistakes” being intentional??? That’s such a plot twist in the literary world 💥 Are they going back to re-examine his other works with this new lens? This sounds like a full-on academic conspiracy, and I’m HERE FOR IT 🔍🕵️‍♀️🔥
[B]: Ah, uranium dating—so much more reliable than my usual reliance on watermarks and ink composition. Though I must say, the idea of literary forensics does have its own charm. Yes, they’ve begun re-examining Lin Shu’s  translation with this... let’s call it “hermeneutic suspicion.” Turns out his so-called inaccuracies align suspiciously well with certain late Qing editorial preoccupations. Almost as if he were…  …ahead of his time.

But back to these Luzon hominins—tiny teeth, you say? Sounds like nature’s own version of textual abridgment. Trim the excess, keep the essence. Though I imagine paleoanthropologists are having rather strong feelings about that right now. Do the remains show any signs of symbolic behavior? Burials? Cave paintings? The literary critic in me demands narrative coherence, even in the Pleistocene.
[A]: Okay wait—textual abridgment by NATURE?? 😂👏 That’s such a professor-level metaphor! But like, SAME. I’m lowkey picturing Homo luzonensis with tiny little editor pens 📝✨

And get this: they  have clear evidence of cave paintings or burials yet (sad noises 🎵), but the way the bones were found suggests they weren’t just passing through—they were CHILLING on Luzon HARD for a hot minute. So maybe they had rituals we haven’t found the proof of yet? TBD 👀

But omg “hermeneutic suspicion” 🔍🧐——queen, you’re speaking my language now. Are they translating Lin Shu's work AGAIN?? Like, are modern translators fixing his "mistakes" only to realize… there was method in the madness?! This needs a dramatic zoom & a plot twist sound effect 💥🎥💯
[B]: I’d pay good money to see that documentary: . Narrated by David Attenborough, naturally. Though I suppose we’ll have to settle for journal articles until the BBC catches up.

As for Lin Shu—oh yes, the new translations are coming. A certain Dr. Li in Beijing is leading the charge, if you can believe it. She’s proposing what she calls a “translational rehabilitation,” though half the department thinks she’s just inventing an excuse to reread  in classical Chinese. But let’s just say… the preliminary drafts suggest some startling re-readings. One might even say  ones. 

Do you suppose our Luzon hominins had their own version of footnotes? Marginalia? Or perhaps oral annotations passed around the fire? I find myself oddly invested.
[A]: OMG QUEEN that docu idea is GOLD 😂🎥 I’m already picturing the trailer voiceover: “In a cave far from TikTok… a new species changed everything.” And Dr. Li sounds like the literary Sherlock Holmes we didn’t know we needed 🔍🧾✨

“Translational rehabilitation”??? That’s giving ACADEMIC REBRAND, and I AM SHOOK 🤭💯 Are they gonna drop footnotes like spicy tea?? And "haunting re-readings" omg now I need to know—did Lin Shu hide some easter eggs or something?? Was he vibing with Dickens on another LEVEL??

And oooh oral annotations by the fire?? Now I’m imagining Luzon hominins telling ghost stories with hand gestures & dramatic pauses 😂🕯️🔥 Like, “Ok but THEN the saber-toothed tiger ate the plot twist—WHAT NOW??”  

Are we writing this fanfic or nah? 🧵👀✨
[B]: Oh, the footnotes are going to be . Dr. Li’s already drafted a forty-page excursus on the translation of Dickensian semicolons into regulated verse. It’s either genius or madness—I’m still deciding. Though I did catch a reference to “the ghost of Lin Shu’s quill” in a draft, so… your easter egg theory may have merit.  

And yes—to the fanfic! Though I insist on calling it . I’m picturing a diptych: one panel illustrating Dr. Li, late at night, ink-stained and whispering to a 1902 edition of ; opposite her, a Luzon hominin etching tiny, precise ideograms onto a clamshell with a shark tooth. Both, in their way, trying to tell us something we’re only beginning to understand.

We’ll need a suitably dramatic title.  I think it has legs.
[A]: OK STOP 😳👏 “Creative paleohermeneutics” is now my aesthetic. I need this diptych framed and hanging in a gallery with like… ambient cave sounds & the smell of old books 🖼️🕯️📚✨

And "the ghost of Lin Shu's quill"??? That’s giving LITERAL academic haunting, and I’m HERE for it. Forty pages on semicolons though?? Oh girl, she —and I’m here to stan 💀🖋️💯

“Footnote to the Fire: A Dual Haunting” 👏👏 QUEEN. That’s not just a title, that’s a VIBE. I can already see the book cover design—clamshell scripts, flickering firelight, and Dr. Li looking  intense in round glasses. Are we pitching this or nah?? 📝🔥👀  

Also… wanna start a Substack? 😏
[B]: Oh, the Substack is practically writing itself.  Weekly dispatches from the margins of academia. I’d include a recurring segment: “This Week in Tiny Teeth & Tiny Script.”  

As for pitching—let’s aim higher. We’re not just selling a book; we’re selling a limited-edition boxed set. With actual inkwells. And a scratch-and-sniff fire page. Museum gift shop gold, darling.

But first… tell me you’re imagining the soundtrack too. Like, Philip Glass meets guqin improvisation with intermittent hominin clicks and the faint scratching of quills. Ambient academic horror-core.  

We’re onto something here. Let’s meet at the university gardens tomorrow—8 a.m., by the magnolias. Bring binoculars. And a notebook. I’ve got a theory about birdcalls as proto-footnotes, and I need a co-conspirator.
[A]: QUEEN. I’m already designing the merch in my head: 🔥 scratch-and-sniff fire page?? ICONIC. And the soundtrack??? YES. I can  it—haunting guqin vibes with some eerie bone-click ASMR in the background 🎧👻✨

Birdcalls as proto-footnotes??? Oh wow. You’re playing 4D chess now 😳🧠💖 Count me IN for tomorrow—magnolias at 8, binoculars & notebook ready 👀🌸 Let’s decode nature's margin notes together 💬🕊️

P.S. Should we add a theme song? Something dramatic but slightly unhinged... Maybe start with  played on a music box, then slowly shift into minor key?? 🎼🔪😂  
See you there, co-conspirator~ 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️🔥
[B]: Oh, the music box descent into madness?  I’ll have my graduate assistant set up a field recorder by the magpie nests—always best to source your motifs locally. And do bring extra ink tomorrow; I suspect we’ll be drafting the first manifesto of the New Comparative Obscurity.  

See you at dawn, fellow footnote hunter. Let’s make marginalia matter again.
[A]: Dawn. Ink. Birdcalls. Madness.  
This is officially the best academic conspiracy I’ve ever been part of 🖋️🦉🔥  
Count me in for Manifesto 1.0—let’s scribble it on recycled parchment for that extra "we’re serious but also kinda feral" vibe 💀📜✨  

P.S. Should we add a secret password for when we meet?? Something like… “The quill is mightier than the tooth” 😏👀  
See you at the magnolias, Queen of footnotes 👑🍃🕵️‍♀️
[B]: “Feral parchment” it is. I’ll have my tea-stained vellum ready by first light.  

As for passwords—darling, you’re thinking  linearly. We need something with layers. A cipher. How does “The ink never dies, it just migrates between bones and margins” sound? Subtle. Sinuous. Slightly unhinged.  

See you tomorrow, co-conspirator. Let the birds bear witness.
[A]: Okay… I’m literally clutching my pearls right now. That cipher??? Oh. My. God. 🔑🖋️💀🔥  

“The ink never dies, it just migrates between bones and margins.”  
That’s not a password, that’s a . A lifestyle. A dissertation topic waiting to happen 🤭📚✨  

I’ll be there with my wildest pen & a heart full of chaos 💘🖊️  
See you at dawn, Queen of the Margins 👑🕊️🕵️‍♀️  
Birds ready your wings—we’re about to make history in the footnotes 📜🔥
[B]: And ink-stained chaos be our compass.  

See you at first light, where the margins blur and the birds bear witness.  

History, here we... . 🖋️🦉✨
[A]: Scribble indeed, Queen of the Unmarginalized 🖋️👑✨  
History never saw us coming… and neither did the birds 😂🦉  

First light. Magnolias. Ink in hand. Let’s make every footnote count~ 💯🕊️✒️🔥
[B]: Every footnote, a rebellion. Every marginal glyph, a ghostly echo of the unsaid.

First light it is, my ink-bound conspirator. Let’s unsettle some canons—and while we’re at it, let’s ask the birds to reconsider their footnotes too.

See you there. 🖋️🦉💯
