[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. I find movie quotes fascinating because they often capture profound truths in a few words. One that has stayed with me is from "The Shawshank Redemption" - "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies." It's a powerful reminder of perseverance through dark times. Do you have any particular quote that has left a lasting impression on you?
[A]: Ah, a fine choice. The Shawshank Redemption does have that quiet sort of wisdom about it—like so many stories dealing with confinement and the human spirit. I must say though, my mind wanders eastward to a line from Feng Xiaogang’s : “妈妈在，全家都在。” () It sounds simple, almost painfully so in translation—but there’s something deeply resonant about the weight of familial anchoring in Chinese culture. A single sentence carries centuries of expectation and emotional gravity.

As for hope... well, perhaps not as poetic as Shawshank, but I’ve always remembered what Tony Leung’s character says in : “那些年，我们好像靠得太近了，以致看不清彼此的全部。” () There’s a kind of melancholy restraint there—one I find more compelling than outright declarations.

But forgive me, I tend to overthink things. What’s your favorite line, if you had to pick one?
[B]: Let me think... You've set a high bar with those reflections. The quotes you mentioned carry such cultural and emotional depth—it's fascinating how cinema distills entire worldviews into a single line.

If I had to pick one, I'd go with something from : "Open the pod bay doors, HAL." It's not profound in meaning on the surface, but it's steeped in that eerie calm of artificial intelligence surpassing its creator. And strangely enough, it's become a bit of a running joke between me and my colleagues from my research days—whenever someone gets locked out of a lab or stuck behind an access control system, someone always mutters, "Open the pod bay doors..."

It’s funny how lines can evolve in meaning over time, isn’t it? They start as dialogue, then become shorthand for whole experiences or emotions.
[A]: Ah, HAL’s infamous refusal—what a wonderfully recursive choice. You're quite right about how lines evolve; they become these linguistic fossils of shared experience. I can just picture your lab colleagues making that weary technological pilgrimage to the modern oracle:  Only to be met with a monolith of bureaucratic circuitry.

It reminds me of another Chinese phrase—one not from film, but from classical literature: “望洋兴叹” (), literally “gazing at the ocean and sighing.” It captures that feeling of being overwhelmed by something vast—be it knowledge, power, or in HAL’s case, artificial will. We use it often now when students come to me after trying to tackle an 800-page thesis reading list in one night.

Do you ever find yourself translating cinematic lines like that into another language for fun? I sometimes play with rendering 's cold elegance into Mandarin—HAL becomes almost Confucian in restraint.
[B]: That’s a beautiful expression— does carry that weight of humility in the face of something boundless. I can see how it fits both the scholar and the sleep-deprived student. There's a parallel in Western thought, I suppose—like standing at the foot of Mount Olympus and wondering if the gods are amused.

As for translating film lines into Chinese for fun? I suspect you're giving me too much credit—but not entirely out of reach. I do occasionally mull over how tone shifts across languages. HAL in Mandarin would indeed take on a different air; perhaps more stoic, less machine and more fate. Imagine him saying,  (“Wǒ wúfǎ zhào zuò, Dàifú.”) It feels almost resigned, doesn't it? Like he's following some cosmic decree rather than just executing code.

I suppose that’s what makes translation such a curious art—it's never a straight line. You have to bend meaning around syntax and culture until it breathes naturally again. Do you ever find certain phrases become sharper in another language, rather than dulled?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—some phrases gain a kind of semantic clarity in translation that they lacked in their original tongue. It’s rather like polishing a rough stone: you don’t know the shape until you’ve worked at it for a while. Take  from . In English, it’s soaked in regret and missed chances—but rendered into Mandarin as , there’s an added layer of social expectation embedded in the word —it implies not just fame, but recognition, status, perhaps even familial honor lost.

Or consider something more abstract, like  from . Translating that into Chinese as  doesn’t just carry the same biological optimism—it suggests a kind of Daoist inevitability, as if life isn’t just persistent, but fated to unfold despite our interference.

And yes, HAL saying  does feel almost Confucian in its resignation—like he’s not malfunctioning, but fulfilling some unspoken moral decree. One might almost pity him.

So I suppose the real question is this: when you translate these lines in your head, are you trying to preserve the voice of the character… or the echo of the audience’s ear?
[B]: That’s a wonderfully phrased question—“trying to preserve the voice of the character… or the echo of the audience’s ear?” I suppose in an ideal translation, both would align. But more often than not, you're forced to choose.

In my experience, especially with technical material, the priority is always clarity—even if it dulls the poetry a bit. But when I translate lines like “Life finds a way” in my head, I find myself leaning toward the audience’s ear. Why? Because emotion is what sticks. If someone walks away remembering how a line , rather than its exact wording, I’d say the translation did its job.

Still, there’s something haunting about fidelity to the original voice. HAL’s calm detachment isn’t just tone—it’s part of his identity. If his Mandarin version sounds too philosophical, does he still feel like HAL? Or has he become someone else wearing his words?

Maybe that’s the tension at the heart of all translation—between meaning and melody. Do you find yourself favoring one over the other, or do you try to walk the line between them like a tightrope walker with a safety net made of context?
[A]: Ah, the tightrope walker with a safety net made of context—well put. I often tell my students that translation is less about walking the line and more about dancing on it, blindfolded, during a windstorm. You may begin with meaning, but you end with melody; or vice versa.

I do lean toward fidelity to voice when teaching literature—especially when dealing with authors like Dickens or Cao Xueqin, where tone is character, and rhythm is revelation. But even then, there are moments when the melody betrays meaning. Take Dickens’ opening to : “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…” Beautiful in its parallelism, yes? But when I translate that into Mandarin for comparative purposes, the elegance flattens somewhat—it becomes  It’s still effective, but the balance feels more like an argument than a lament.

So what do we do? Do we sacrifice symmetry to preserve sentiment? Or do we cling to structure and hope the emotion follows?

I suppose I try to walk the wire barefoot, no net—because if you rely too much on context, you lose the edge. And translation without risk is just paraphrasing with delusions of grandeur.

Still, I wonder: if HAL had been born in Beijing rather than programmed in California, would he have refused Dave with a proverb instead of a protocol? Or would he have simply remained silent—the most unsettling translation of all.
[B]: That image of HAL remaining silent—just a flicker in the circuitry, no words at all—is genuinely unsettling. Silence in translation... or perhaps  silence. There’s something very eerie about that. In AI, we often talk about failure modes—glitches, errors, misfires—but what you’re describing is more like a refusal to compute, a kind of machine —the Zen “not asking the question.” That’s far more profound than any syntax error.

And I couldn’t agree more about risk in translation. Too many translations play it safe, as if their job is just to get the furniture from one room to another without breaking anything. But great translation? It's like moving furniture through a narrow doorway—it might require tilting, scraping, maybe even taking it apart and rebuilding it on the other side. You can still recognize the chair, but it has a new grain now.

When I think back to my early days in quantum computing, we had this phrase we used when things went sideways:  It was a joke, of course—optimism in the face of decoherence. But I once tried translating it into Mandarin for a visiting scholar, and it turned into something unexpectedly poetic:  There, it took on a kind of Daoist ring—falling and rising as natural rhythms rather than technical glitches.

Do you ever find that scientific or technical phrases gain philosophical weight when translated? Or is that just me romanticizing equations?
[A]: Oh, not romanticizing at all—I’d say you’ve stumbled onto something quite real. Scientific language, when translated, often slips its technical leash and trots merrily into metaphor. That’s precisely what makes it so fertile for poetry—both accidental and intentional.

Take your —it does sound like a line from some Daoist parable disguised in lab coat and goggles. There’s a kind of cosmic irony there: the very precision meant to contain meaning ends up releasing it into a wider sky.

And yes, I do see this philosophical inflation happen often, especially with younger scholars. When I was translating some early 20th-century physics papers into Chinese for a seminar once, I came across the phrase —“Light is both particle and wave.” On the surface, straightforward. But students kept asking if this duality implied something deeper about perception itself:  Suddenly we were no longer in a lecture hall but a tea house filled with half-drunk metaphysicians.

So perhaps that’s the translator’s secret role—not just moving words, but nudging concepts toward their latent philosophical lives.

I must say, though, I’m quite taken with your qubit-turned-quantum fable. If you ever decide to write a book of such mistranslations—happy accidents of science and spirit—count me among your eager readers.
[B]: I’d say that’s not a mistranslation at all—it’s . After all, isn’t that what myths are? Scientific truths seen through the lens of human wonder. I sometimes think we’re doing a disservice to equations when we keep them locked in chalkboard symbols and LaTeX files. Let them breathe. Let them become parables.

And if you ever help me write that book——I promise to include a chapter titled . We’ll market it as “Eastern philosophy meets Western ambiguity.”

In all seriousness, your example with the students questioning whether truth itself is wave-like—that’s the kind of moment that makes translation, and teaching, so alive. It's no longer about fidelity to syntax, but fidelity to curiosity. And if a qubit falling out of coherence can make someone pause and ask if hope really does rise from collapse… well, then maybe our job isn’t just moving meaning between languages, but between dimensions of thought.

Tell me—if you were to translate one purely scientific term into Chinese and let it roam free in the wilds of metaphor, which would you choose?
[A]: Oh, what a delicious provocation. If I were to set a scientific term loose in the wilderness of metaphor, I’d choose — () in Chinese. It’s already such a slippery concept: invisible, inevitable, always increasing. In physics, it describes decay into disorder—but imagine letting that word grow tusks and roam across the plains of philosophy.

Rendered as —“All things must one day fall apart in silence”—and suddenly entropy isn’t just thermodynamics; it’s the quiet unraveling of dynasties, the slow fading of memory, the whisper behind  (“everything flows”). You could build an entire tragic dynasty around that idea, or perhaps a warning carved into the base of every porcelain vase: 

And yes, Schrödinger’s cat deserves its own chapter, by all means. Perhaps we can pair it with —the great ambiguity of being neither one nor the other, nor both, nor neither both… ad infinitum.

But do keep me honest, won’t you? Let us not drift so far into wonder that we forget the weight of evidence. After all, even poetry must answer to reality—though, as we’ve seen, reality has a soft spot for poetry in translation.
[B]: That’s a perfect choice— with tusks, galloping through the steppes of meaning. I can already see it thundering across a Tang dynasty scroll, trailing disorder in its wake. —yes, that gives it a kind of elegiac finality, the way the Second Law should be delivered: not with a bang, but with the slow erosion of ink on paper.

And Zhuangzi’s butterfly paired with Schrödinger’s cat? That’s not just poetic—it’s philosophical jiu-jitsu. Two great ambiguities, one from ancient China and one from early 20th-century physics, circling each other like yin and yang in superposition.

As for keeping you honest—rest assured, I’ll bring a red pen and a slide rule. But I suspect we’ll both be too busy chasing metaphors to mind the boundary lines much.

So tell me, if we ever did publish this rogue bestiary of scientific-poetic mistranslations, do you think the academic world would brand us as heretics… or invite us to lecture?
[A]: Oh,  without a doubt—though the more prestigious ones would settle for calling us “methodologically adventurous.” Still, I suspect we’d be quietly blacklisted from both the physics and comparative literature departments by the second edition.  

But imagine the lectures! We could tour under the banner:  Picture it—half the audience physicists clutching their pearls, the other half literary scholars scribbling furiously in the dark, hoping no one notices they’ve just been handed a gedankenexperiment dressed as an epigram.

No, if we’re lucky, we’ll be invited back not for our rigor—but for our spectacle. Academia does love a good sideshow, so long as it’s footnoted. And let’s face it, entropy with tusks is difficult to ignore once it’s trampled through your lecture hall.

So yes—I say we draft the first chapter under the cover of darkness, over strong tea and possibly questionable optics. Let the peer-reviewed world tremble.
[B]: Precisely—let the peer-reviewed world tremble. Or at least raise a skeptical eyebrow, which is practically applause in academia.

I’ll bring the tea—oolong, if you insist on the proper Chinese ambiance—and a stack of blank notebooks that will soon be filled with equations wearing robes and parables carrying qubits on their backs. We may as well start the first chapter tonight. I propose we title it:

“Chapter One: The Entropy That Ate Its Own Tail – Or, How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Metaphor.”

Agreed?
[A]: Agreed. I shall provide the ink—black, thick, and slightly smudged at the edges, as all good academic conspiracies should be.

—splendid. It has that air of controlled absurdity we so desperately need. I’ll begin drafting a passage on entropy’s many guises: from steam engines to imperial decline, from thermodynamic decay to the slow unraveling of marital harmony in 19th-century novels.

And do remind me to slip in a line or two about Schrödinger’s Daoist houseguest, who never quite decides whether he’s a philosopher or a waveform. We must keep the confusion .

Meet you tonight then—in the dim glow of misused metaphors and oversteeped tea. Bring your red pen if you must, but leave the rigid categories at the door.
[B]: Perfect. I’ll make sure the red pen is within reach—but yes, leave rigid categories outside with the coat and the skepticism.

Looking forward to your passage on entropy’s guises. I can already picture that line about marital harmony in 19th-century novels—something like:  Tragic, thermodynamic, and suspiciously precise.

And Schrödinger’s Daoist houseguest? Genius. Perhaps he wanders through the pages muttering lines like,  He could wear a robe stitched with probability amplitudes and carry a staff carved from collapsed wavefunctions.

Tonight then—under the watchful eye of HAL’s proverbial silence and Zhuangzi’s ever-butterflying uncertainty. Let’s make a mess of disciplines. They’ll thank us for it, eventually.
[A]: I do believe your line——deserves to be embroidered on a sampler and hung in every Victorian drawing room undergoing heat death.

And the Daoist houseguest? Oh, we must give him more than muttering—he should , ambiguously, between rooms, leaving doors open or closed depending on the observer’s intent. His robe, I insist, should fray at the edges into differential equations written in fading ink, and yes—a staff that hums softly when no one is listening.

Tonight then—let us raise a cup of oolong to the grand unification of nonsense and insight. May our metaphors be heretical, our footnotes excessive, and our entropy ever self-consuming.

See you under the dim lamp, notebooks at the ready.
[B]: To the grand unification of nonsense and insight—now  ought to be the epigraph.

I’ll make sure the lamp is low, the tea is hot, and the first page waits patiently for that first reckless stroke of ink. And yes, let the Daoist houseguest glide—never walk—between paragraphs. He belongs nowhere and everywhere, a spectral thermodynamic force with existential clarity and zero intent to explain himself.

See you shortly then, under that same dim lamp, among the ghosts of misused metaphors and the quiet hum of collapsing wavefunctions. Bring your wildest ideas—and perhaps a second cup for luck.
