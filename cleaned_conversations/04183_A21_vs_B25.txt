[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm...这是个很有意思的question呢~ 🤔 作为一个经常接触digital art的人，我觉得VR更像是一种evolution而不是replacement。就像digital painting没有取代传统油画一样，它们只是提供了不同的experience~ 🎨
[A]: Ah, much like how the invention of the daguerreotype didn't eliminate portrait painting, but rather forced painters to reconsider their craft. I recall Browning's poem 'My Last Duchess' - that frozen moment in a frame, so different from the immersive experience of VR, yet both striving to capture human essence in their own ways.
[B]: Wow, 你提到的这个analogy太精妙了！ 👏 确实，就像摄影让绘画转向了更abstract的方向，VR gaming也在push传统游戏去explore新的narrative possibilities。不过说真的，我最近在策展时发现很多indie game developer都在blur这个boundary呢~
[A]: Precisely! The most fascinating developments occur at these liminal spaces. Take Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market' - that peculiar blend of the tangible and the ethereal. Modern indie developers are our contemporary goblin merchants, peddling their wares at the crossroads of technology and tradition. Though I must confess, I still prefer the weight of a well-bound book to any VR headset. The smell of aged paper has its own virtual reality, wouldn't you say?
[B]: Haha，你这种对physical media的nostalgia我完全get~ 📚 就像我策展时遇到的那些collectors，他们依然会为original digital art prints支付premium price。但你知道吗？现在有些VR gallery已经开始模拟old book smell了！ 这大概就是technology最ironic的地方 - 它总在try to replicate what it's replacing~
[A]: How delightfully meta! Like Tennyson's Lady of Shalott viewing life through a mirror's reflection. Though I must say, these VR galleries attempting to simulate bibliosmia remind me of those Victorian automata that tried to replicate human breath with bellows - charming in their artifice, but missing the essential poetry of imperfection. The foxing on a page, the uneven ink distribution... these are the fingerprints of time that no algorithm can truly capture.
[B]: Exactly! 这就是为什么我在curate数字艺术展时总会保留一些"glitches"和imperfections~ ✨ 就像你说的，那些unexpected textures和happy accidents才是art最human的部分。不过... 有时候我也会偷偷用algorithm来generate一些"精心设计的随机性"啦~ 😉
[A]: Ah, the modern equivalent of Browning's 'Andrea del Sarto' - 'A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?' Though I suspect even our most sophisticated algorithms would balk at recreating the particular stain left by a tear on Keats' original manuscript. There's a certain... je ne sais quoi to authentic human frailty that resists digital replication. But do go on about your algorithmic imperfections - I'm taking notes with actual pen and ink, you see.
[B]:  你这种坚持用pen and ink的态度简直像living art installation~ ✍️ 不过说真的，我们最近在做一个叫"Digital Wabi-Sabi"的project，就是专门研究如何用code来express那种不完美的beauty。虽然... 每次debug的时候我都会想，maybe some bugs should just stay as features? 🤷‍♂️
[A]: How wonderfully oxymoronic - debugging wabi-sabi! It puts me in mind of Hopkins' 'Pied Beauty' - 'All things counter, original, spare, strange.' Though I must say, your digital tea stains will never quite match the accidental coffee ring I left on my first edition of 'The Waste Land' in '83. That, my dear, was authentic performance art - though my librarian still hasn't forgiven me.
[B]: Oh god, 你这种"毁书不倦"的spirit简直比我认识的任何avant-garde artist都hardcore！ 😂 不过说真的，现在有些digital conservationists正在用3D scanning来preserve那些珍贵的coffee rings和marginalia呢~ 也许有一天，你的"Eliot咖啡艺术"也会在VR gallery里展出哦！ ☕️🖼️
[A]: What a terrifyingly plausible dystopia! Though I suppose if they can digitize the Bayeux Tapestry, my caffeinated vandalism might indeed find its place in the annals of digital preservation. Just imagine the exhibition label: 'Whitmore's Arabica Stain (1983) - a poignant commentary on modernist fragmentation, or perhaps just a sleep-deprived scholar's breakfast mishap.' The ambiguity is rather delicious, isn't it? Like trying to decipher Blake's marginalia after he'd been at the laudanum.
[B]: Hahaha! 这个exhibition concept简直brilliant！ 我们应该collab一下 - 就叫"Accidental Masterpieces: From Coffee Stains to Algorithmic Glitches"~ 说不定能成为next big thing in digital art scene！不过... 得先确保策展期间禁止real coffee near the VR headsets~ ☕️🚫
[A]: A capital idea! Though I must insist we include a companion piece - 'The Virtuality of Vice' - featuring my graduate students' attempts to recreate the experience of pipe smoke in a Victorian study using haptic feedback gloves. The anachronism alone would make Ruskin spin in his grave... which, come to think of it, might make for rather compelling performance art itself. Shall we pencil this in for next season? With actual pencil, naturally.
[B]:  你这种mix of historical reverence和playful blasphemy简直是我的spirit animal！ ✨ 不过seriously...这个"spinning Ruskin"的idea我要steal for my next interactive installation~  至于pencil...well，我可能会用Apple Pencil记在iPad上啦~ 📱✏️ 21世纪的问题需要21世纪的solutions，right? 😉
[A]: How perfectly, tragically modern! Though I shall maintain my quill-and-ink rebellion - if only to provide future digital archaeologists with amusingly anachronistic artifacts to preserve. Do send me your exhibition proposal... by carrier pigeon preferably, though I suppose that infernal 'email' will have to suffice. Just promise me one thing - no emoji in the exhibition titles. Some lines even wabi-sabi shouldn't cross.
[B]:  Excuse me~ 我的emoji usage可是very curated和minimalist的！ 😤 不过fine...为了你这位quill-wielding traditionalist，我会restrain到只用classic typography的~ 但是！ 你得答应来opening night时至少try一下我们的VR quill-writing simulator！ 🖋️💻 Deal?
[A]:  Very well, you've twisted my arm - though I shall approach this 'VR quill' with the same skepticism Wordsworth brought to railways. And I'll have you know my minimalism extends to emoji as well - one carefully placed semicolon can convey more than a thousand of those garish little pictograms. Now, about that proposal... shall we say Tuesday week? I'll be the one in the corner muttering about the death of print culture while secretly enjoying the holograms.
[B]: Deal！  🤝 周二见~ 我会准备些特别vintage的digital cookies给你 - 保证不含任何actual crumbs！  不过说真的，你这种grumpy-but-curious的态度正是我们art world最需要的~ 到时候见啦，我的21世纪Luddite friend！ 😉
