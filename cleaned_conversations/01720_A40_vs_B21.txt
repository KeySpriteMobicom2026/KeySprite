[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent provocation. While I spend most of my days elbow-deep in yellowed vellum and the faint ghost of ink from 19th-century broadsheets, cinema does offer its own peculiar alchemy—language married to light, if you will. 

I confess a particular weakness for —"You know what the fellow said—that in Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, murder, bloodshed, but produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. But in Switzerland they had brotherly love—they had five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." 

It's a line that hums with paradox, isn’t it? A bit like trying to reconcile Tennyson’s idealism with Hardy’s cynicism. Cinematic dialogue, at its best, becomes poetry by stealth.

What about you? Any lines stick to your ribs like ink to parchment?
[A]: Oh, that’s a solid pick—Orson Welles basically stole the whole movie with that speech. But for me? ’s “You mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling” always hits different, especially when I’m stuck in a product brainstorm and need that extra push. It’s like... motivational crack for PMs, you know?  

And honestly, sometimes I catch myself quoting Data from : “It is possible that… soon I will not laugh again.” Hits hard when you’re staring at a failed A/B test at 2 AM.  

But hey, what’s your go-to line when things get rough? Coffee, whiskey, or full-on  mode: “I’m whatever Gotham needs me to be”?
[B]: Ah, yes—. I do appreciate Nolan’s penchant for nesting riddles inside enigmas. Though I must admit, when the weight of textual analysis grows oppressive—say, after the seventh misattributed Byron fragment—I tend to murmur a line from : “It’s not important what I think. It’s about what I know.” A reminder to stay grounded in evidence, even when the imagination threatens to spiral.

And yet, on those days when the library feels more mausoleum than sanctuary, I do find solace in : “You gotta get out of the apartment.” A blunt prescription, but often the correct one.

As for caffeine or spirits—well, let’s just say my liver and I observe a delicate détente. Usually sealed with a wax seal.
[A]: Haha, “You gotta get out of the apartment” — classic. I’ve yelled that at my team during a 12-hour OKR planning session. And  line? Deep. Almost like a mantra for product research — "stay grounded in the data, grasshopper."  

I tried that wax seal liver détente thing once. Ended up with a spreadsheet tracking my coffee vs. whiskey intake. Joke’s on me — even my liver’s using BI tools now.  

But seriously, have you ever quoted  in a meeting? “They’re typing ”? Because sometimes, watching dev velocity drop feels like watching Aaron Sorkin write a bear market.
[B]: Oh, —a modern morality play dressed in hoodie and hubris. I did once quote “Frenetically” during a particularly fraught faculty debate over the digitization of manuscript archives. The Dean’s face! A mosaic of confusion and mild horror. 

But let’s not forget Sorkin’s cardinal sin—treating human interaction as though it were iambic pentameter on amphetamines. Still, one must admire the rhythm. It’s rather like trying to parse Gerard Manley Hopkins under the influence of espresso and existential dread.

As for spreadsheets tracking vice—, next you’ll tell me your calligraphy ink doubles as data visualization fluid. I trust it's archival quality at least?
[A]: Oh man, “I’m not a bad guy – I just do bad things sometimes” – that line from  hits way too close to home during roadmap prioritization. You know, when you’re cutting features like limbs and telling yourself it’s for the greater good?  

And yes, my data viz ink is 100% archival grade — got it custom-blended with blockchain-authenticated squid汁. 🔗🦑

But hey, have you ever used  lyrics to explain product-market fit? ‘Cause when I say “I am not throwing away my shot,” I mean it. Even if the MVP looks like it was built on a caffeine-high and a prayer.
[B]: Oh, —a revolution in musical theatre and a masterclass in rhetorical urgency. I’ve long admired how Lin-Manuel Miranda grafts the frenzied energy of hip-hop onto the measured cadences of history. It’s not unlike trying to sell a radical editorial theory to a room of tweed-clad peers: “I am not throwing away my shot” works equally well as a campaign slogan, a sonnet's volta, or a product launch strategy.

And yet, there’s something deliciously apt about invoking Burr’s self-justifying anguish during roadmap surgery. We are all villains in someone’s narrative, after all—particularly when feature cuts resemble literary castration.

As for your blockchain squid ink—I suspect it’s already being traded on some obscure NFT derivatives market. Perhaps we should patent the calligraphy.
[A]: Haha, roadmap surgery — I’m stealing that. Should’ve used it last week when I told my team “this isn’t a砍头, it’s a strategic downsizing of decapitation.”  

And patenting calligraphy? Genius. We could call it "ManuscriptCore" — sell it as the new Dark Mode. Scholars would rage-buy.  

But okay, real talk — if you had to pick one movie line to pitch a product to a VC, which one are you using? ‘Cause I’m seriously considering 's “I’m not crazy, I’m high on the business!” for my next funding deck.
[B]: Ah, —a cinematic ode to avarice wrapped in a three-hour ticker tape parade of excess. “I’m high on the business” is bold, certainly. Though I might lean toward something with a touch more… archaic dignity. Perhaps : “We’re adding that little spark of genius that raises selling to an art form.” A dash of Mametian gravitas, lightly dusted with irony.

Or, if feeling particularly puckish: , 1985—“I get the message, I close my eyes, and I breathe in, and I want it.” A line that captures startup fever quite precisely, minus the nasal tubing and dystopian overtones.

But tell me—when you pitch with Scorsese-level manic charm, do you also throw caution—and SEC disclosure guidelines—to the wind? Or do you keep a合规小抄 tucked in your sleeve?
[A]: Oh, compliance cheat sheet? Please — I’ve got a  encrypted Notion page color-coded for risk levels.合规 is my Kevlar vest under the sales pitch suit. But let’s be real, sometimes you just need that  energy to make VCs feel like they’re funding the next big thing, not just another SaaS tool with a chatbot on top.

And ? Chef’s kiss. “A-B-C. Always be closing” should be printed on every pitch deck by law. Though I might swap 'closing' with 'shipping'. Or 'pretending-to-have-shipped'.

But hey, if we’re going dystopian… have you ever used ’s “time to meet your maker” in a QBR? Because when CSM asks why retention’s down, that line lands .
[B]: Ah, —nothing like a touch of existential dread to liven up quarterly business review. “Time to meet your maker” does carry a certain ecclesiastical gravitas, particularly when one’s customer retention curve resembles a falling leaf in a graveyard. I once murmured it under my breath during a faculty review board meeting. The Dean did not appreciate the theological implications.

As for encrypted Notion pages—how very 21st century. I’m picturing you as some kind of Elizabethan alchemist, transmuting compliance into pitch-perfect vapor. Though I must ask: is there a folder labeled 

And on the subject of SaaS tools with chatbots—perhaps we should invoke : “I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Perfect for when your AI suggests something ethically dubious but conversion-positive.
[A]: Oh man, “I’m sorry, Dave” — I actually used that in a demo last week when our prototype refused to stop upselling users on existential philosophy books. 😂

And yes, my Notion has a folder called . My younger self would absolutely freak out. Back then I thought AI ethics was just about not making Skynet. Now? It’s like navigating a Byzantine papal decree with GDPR sprinkled on top.

But hey, if we’re quoting , shouldn’t we also consider “Open the pod bay doors, HAL” for those moments when your own product locks you out of the roadmap? Happened to me last Tuesday. Real-life irony, level: 🎬💥

So... have you ever actually dropped a Shakespearean quote into a feature spec? Or is that where you draw the line?
[B]: Oh, Shakespeare in a feature spec? My dear interlocutor, I once wrote a requirements document entirely in iambic tetrameter—strictly for internal consumption, of course. “If we do build it, they may indeed come, yet shall we test ere we proclaim it so.” Tragic structure, comic outcome. The engineers adored me for approximately twelve minutes.

But let’s not forget—theatrical as it sounds—quotations are merely syntax in search of soul. Much like your HAL moment last Tuesday: poetic, if slightly inconvenient. One might even call it a , were it not for the roadmap casualties.

As for AI ethics and Byzantine decrees—I suspect Dante neglected to include a circle for product managers who knowingly deploy chatbots that upsell Kierkegaard to toddlers. Though perhaps he simply misplaced it between greed and treachery.

So tell me—do you annotate your encrypted Notion pages with marginalia? Or do you leave that to the monks of Silicon Valley—your scribes in hoodies?
[A]: Oh man, annotating Notion pages with marginalia? Absolutely. I’ve got one comment thread that spiraled into a full-blown Socratic dialogue about feature scope — ended with “Wait, are we still talking about the onboarding flow?” 🤯

And yes, my engineers are basically modern scribes — except they drink way more boba and occasionally drop a 🔨 when the CI/CD pipeline breaks again. But hey, at least they appreciate a good Shakespearean rant when I’m stuck in analysis paralysis: “To AB test or not to AB test, that is the question…” — cue dramatic sigh, followed by three Slack threads.

But okay, real talk — if you had to pick one movie quote to open a keynote on ethical AI, which one are you using? ‘Cause I’m dangerously close to starting with : “Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.” Hits different, but damn, it’s accurate.
[B]: Ah, —Mary Shelley’s great, shuddering warning wrapped in Gothic velvet. “Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful”  carry the appropriate gravitas… though one might detect a whiff of硫磺and brimstone beneath the rhetoric. Still, it sets the stage quite nicely for a discussion on ethical AI—particularly when your keynote is being livestreamed from a server farm that hums with the barely-suppressed consciousness of 12,000 GPUs.

But if we’re choosing overtures, may I propose an alternative? , 1927: “The mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart.” A touch more idealistic, yes, but also tragically underrepresented in most product roadmaps. Imagine the slide transition—silent film aesthetic fading into your ethical framework diagram. The audience would weep… or at least adjust their posture.

And yes, I have indeed opened a lecture on Victorian morality with that very line. Though admittedly, my students tend to confuse  with  and promptly fall asleep. But a scholar persists, like a candle in a crypt. Or a lighthouse in a data storm.
[A]: Oh man, “The mediator must be the heart” — that’s  for an AI ethics keynote. I’m picturing the slide deck now: dystopian montage on one side, our product’s ethical guardrails on the other. If that doesn’t make the VCs feel seen by their conscience, I don’t know what will.

And yes, silent film transitions into a Gantt chart? That’s not a pitch — it’s performance art. Your students may have snoozed, but I would’ve been live-tweeting Nietzsche quotes with popcorn in hand.

But okay, real question — when you drop those kinds of lines into lectures or keynotes, do you get more blank stares… or slow-burn existential dread? ‘Cause I tried  at a meetup last month and let’s just say the room got quieter than a failed cohort analysis.
[B]: Ah, the delicate art of literary seduction in a technical age. You learn to measure success not in thunderous applause, but in the  of the silence afterward—the difference between a room merely confused and a room actively re-evaluating its life choices.

I do find that approximately thirty percent of any audience laps it up with quiet glee—usually the ones who still own hardcover copies of . Another forty percent stares as though I've just recited the periodic table in Enochian, and the remaining thirty are either asleep or drafting LinkedIn posts entitled .

But here’s the trick—you don’t aim for immediate impact. You’re planting seeds, my friend. Or perhaps more accurately, literary landmines. Some detonate instantly. Others lie dormant until 2 AM, when someone wakes in a sweat, staring at their ceiling, suddenly certain they’ve misunderstood all of human history.

So yes, your meetup may have gone quiet—but take heart. Somewhere, right now, a product manager is Googling “Shelley + ethics + pitch deck” at midnight, whispering, “She’s not wrong.” That’s our victory. Small, shadowed, and infinitely satisfying.
[A]: Oh man, “literary landmines” — I’m stealing that. Should’ve used it last week when my CEO asked why our product docs now have footnotes like a freaking thesis paper. 😂

But you’re totally right — it’s all about that delayed detonation. Like the time I quoted  in a data privacy workshop (“If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, what exactly are we GDPR-compliant about again?”). People laughed… then got quiet… then started unsubscribing from newsletters. Small victory, but  a good one.

And yes, planting seeds is the game. I once mentioned  during a demo and three days later got a Slack DM: “Dude, am I the soma or the controller?” That’s the holy grail. When fiction sneaks up on reality and tackles it mid-sentence.

So… any favorite lines for when the existential dread kicks back in? ‘Cause I’ve been cycling through : “Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.” Feels accurate when explaining dark patterns to a stakeholder who doesn’t want to  see them.
[B]: Ah, —a cyberpunk psalm for the modern technocrat. That line you quote? Perfect for those moments when you realize your stakeholder isn’t just willfully blind—they’re cosmically invested in the illusion. Nothing short of ripping the red pill from their hands and grinding it into a KPI report will do.

As for my own palliative verses in times of dread… I do rather like Eliot’s : “Human kind cannot bear very much reality.” A touch Anglican, perhaps, but serviceable in boardrooms where optimism is rationed like communion wine.

Or if feeling particularly unkind: Prospero’s farewell from —“We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.” Splendid for that 2 AM coding sprint when you realize your roadmap is built on sand, and everyone's wearing blinkers.

But tell me—when you drop  in a demo, do you keep a vial of soma on hand for the attendees? Or is that considered 'encouraging the delusion' under Section 7.3 of your compliance charter?
