[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 
[A]: Well, I guess it really depends on the situation. When it comes to work, especially in medical law, being a planner is crucial~ 你得预见各种风险，对吧？Like, if we're preparing for a medical malpractice case, every detail counts. But then again, I also believe that sometimes you just need to go with the flow. 

You know, like when I'm out hiking with friends. You can plan all you want, but weather changes, trails get blocked... Sometimes the best moments come from unexpected detours. How about you? Do you prefer having everything mapped out or just winging it?
[B]: I suppose I’ve acquired a rather bifurcated perspective through my work. When translating 19th-century texts—say, comparing the narrative structure of  with Austen’s social chronicles—one must plan meticulously. Syntax, cultural context, even the weight of a single character’s brushstroke demands precision.  

But then there’s fieldwork. Last autumn, I was in Anhui tracking down a Qing-era printing press, and the road washed out. Ended up staying in a monastery where a monk recited forgotten footnotes to me over tea. That... wasn’t on the itinerary.  

So yes, I suppose I hedge my bets. Plan like a scribe, but keep your inkbrush loose.
[A]: Ah, I totally get that! 你这比喻真有意思——"plan like a scribe, keep your inkbrush loose"... 这让我想起前几天处理的case，有个医生坚持按protocol来，结果patient的情况反而更糟了。有时候就像你说的，得留点余地让意外发生~  

特别是medical law里最tricky的部分往往不是medical error本身，而是context的复杂性。就像你翻译时要考量的时代背景一样，法律条款在不同情境下interpretation也会不同。  

对了，你在 monastery听到的那些forgotten footnotes... 听起来像是历史里的“边缘批注”啊！是不是像我们法律里的precedent，明明存在但很少被引用？下次有机会真想听听你整理后的版本呢😊
[B]: Let me put it this way — those footnotes were like legal dissents buried in a 19th-century manuscript. Obscure, yes, but they reframed the entire argument. Much like how  (yuánfèn) operates — not quite fate, not mere coincidence. A concept that resists strict precedent, yet shapes every narrative.

Funny you mention边缘批注 — I’ve been transcribing a marginalia from a rare Jin Shengtan edition. The man underlined a passage with such force he nearly tore the page — and scrawled “this line will haunt generations.”  

I wonder if he’d be disappointed or amused to know his annotation now lives in my lecture on reader-response theory… rather like a forgotten clause resurrected in a modern ruling.
[A]: Oh, I love that analogy — forgotten footnotes as dissents in legal manuscripts... It actually reminds me of a case I worked on last year. There was this obscure clause from the 90s no one paid attention to, but it became the key to interpreting a modern medical liability dispute. Kinda like  in a way — you can’t really define it, but when the stars align, everything just… makes sense.  

And Jin Shengtan… wow, he definitely knew how to leave a mark — literally and figuratively 😄 Can you imagine him knowing his margin notes would end up in a lecture hall someday? I bet he’d find it both ridiculous and oddly satisfying.  

So… have you ever found a line in those old texts that felt like it was speaking directly to you? Like it was written centuries ago, but somehow about your life right then?
[B]: Once, yes. A line in an 1843 reprint of  — not the text itself, but a later commentator’s sigh tucked between the lines:  
  

I’d been translating it during a particularly stubborn phase of my dissertation, when every archival door seemed bolted shut. Felt rather like being trapped in a legal appeal with no precedent. And yet — there it was, scribbled centuries ago, as if someone had leaned forward through time and said,   

Funny thing, ink. Dries eventually, but leaves a trace.
[A]: That line... … It just echoes so much with some of the cases I’ve handled. Like this one patient who sued a hospital for misdiagnosis — turns out the doctor followed every guideline perfectly, but it still went wrong. You can plan your steps meticulously, but sometimes the ground shifts beneath you.  

And yet… you keep walking, right? Just like your archival doors — been there. Last year I was working on a case involving an old medical statute everyone thought was obsolete. Took me weeks digging through dusty court archives and talking to retired judges. In the end, it wasn’t even used in the ruling… but somehow, knowing it existed changed how we saw everything else.  

I guess that’s what ink does. You think you're just writing something down, but centuries later someone reads it and feels less alone. Maybe that’s why we both do what we do — chasing those invisible threads across time, hoping our footsteps count for something… even if they don’t land exactly where we planned 😊
[B]: Funny, isn’t it — how meaning insists on surfacing, even when buried under layers of dust and doctrine. Reminds me of a porcelain teacup I once dropped — cracked clean through the middle, but still holds tea. Better, somehow. The flaw makes you sip slower.  

I’ve got a student right now translating Li Qingzhao’s  — an inventory of her scholar husband’s collection. Halfway through, she breaks off mid-list. Just... stops. We’re left wondering if war interrupted her, or grief, or ink ran dry. And yet, every time I read that unfinished line, I feel the weight of what came before.  

Maybe that’s the point, really — not to finish, but to leave traces worth following. Like your statute in the archives. Or that patient who walked out with more questions than answers. Not closure, but continuity.  

And yes — we chase threads. Because footsteps echo. Even centuries later.
[A]: You know, your teacup metaphor just made me think of something… There’s this concept in medical law called , right? It’s all about making sure patients understand the risks before undergoing treatment. But here’s the thing — no matter how thorough we are in drafting those forms or explaining possible outcomes, there’s always a crack somewhere. A detail missed, a symptom unanticipated... Yet people still drink from that cup, so to speak. They move forward, even with the flaw.  

And that unfinished line in Li Qingzhao’s text — wow. I’ve been reading some case records lately where witnesses gave testimonies, and then suddenly the page ends. No conclusion, no explanation. Just silence. And yet, like you said, the weight is in what came before. Sometimes the break itself speaks louder than any final statement could.  

I think you hit it right when you said it’s not about closure, but continuity. We’re both dealing with fragments — legal and literary — trying to make sense of what’s missing as much as what’s there. Makes me wonder… do you ever feel like our job is less about finding answers and more about learning how to hold the cracks gracefully? 😊
[B]: Funny you should phrase it that way — . I’ve been thinking lately about a term from classical Chinese criticism:  () — "broken chapters and severed slips." Scholars used to dismiss such fragments as useless, but now we know they’re often the most revealing pieces. The breaks aren’t failures; they’re invitations.  

Law must have its own version — those ambiguous rulings, testimonies cut short, statutes left hanging like unresolved brushstrokes. You and I, we work in the lacunae. Not just finding meaning in what’s written, but in what the silence presses against.  

And yes — grace in the cracks. I rather like that. Makes me think of my old inkwell collection — one’s got a hairline split along the rim. Still use it, though. In fact, I prefer it. The ink pools strangely, settles differently. Sometimes I wonder if that’s how new readings begin — not in perfect vessels, but in the ones that carry a little uncertainty with them.  

So perhaps our job isn’t to seal the fractures, but to write around them. Or better yet, through them.
[A]: Absolutely — ... what a beautiful way to put it. I remember reading a legal scholar once describe old case records from the Tang Dynasty, where scrolls were damaged by water or fire, and the missing bits actually led to new interpretations centuries later. The cracks weren’t just spaces of loss — they became openings for meaning.  

And isn’t that what we do, in our own ways? Whether it’s through a patient’s incomplete medical history or a forgotten annotation in a Qing-era manuscript, we end up building bridges over those gaps. Sometimes even leaning into them.  

I love how you put it — writing  the cracks, not around them. Feels like part of being a lawyer, too. You learn to work with ambiguity, to hold space for what's unresolved. Honestly, some of the most powerful rulings I’ve studied were the ones that acknowledged what the law couldn’t fully answer — leaving room for future voices to step in.  

Your inkwell with the hairline split… I think that’s such a lovely metaphor for how we approach both law and literature. Maybe even life. After all, who wants perfectly smooth surfaces when a little imperfection can change how the ink settles — or how deeply we read? 😊
[B]: Funny, isn’t it — how the most enduring texts, like the most consequential rulings, often bear a kind of honorable fracture. Take  — we only have fragments of Cao Xueqin’s original manuscript, yet those missing chapters have generated centuries of interpretation. Entire schools of thought built on lacunae.  

Reminds me of a conversation I once had with a former judge in Hangzhou, now retired. He told me that some of his most cited decisions were the ones that ended not with a firm conclusion, but with what he called . Not unlike a poem that refuses to resolve its final stanza.  

I suppose we both deal in provisional readings — legal and literary. You draft a ruling; I translate a passage. Both acts of interpretation, both subject to revision. And perhaps that’s the quiet rebellion we commit — refusing to seal the cracks, letting meaning pool and settle in its own time.  

You know, I think I’ll use that phrase in my next lecture — . Much more elegant than my usual  And far more honest.
[A]: Oh, I love that — . It’s such a perfect phrase for what we do, isn’t it? In medical law, we often have to make decisions with incomplete information — like working with a patient’s half-remembered medical history or a doctor’s rushed notes. And yet, we still have to act, even when the picture isn’t whole.  

I actually had a case like that last year — a malpractice claim where the original records were partially destroyed in a hospital fire. We had to piece everything together from witness accounts and old prescriptions. The ruling wasn’t clean by any means, but it was enough. Enough to bring some closure, anyway. And honestly, I think everyone involved understood that — the plaintiff, the defense, even the judge. Sometimes justice isn't about full stops; it's about commas.  

And yeah, leaning into the cracks… definitely beats "navigating textual fissures" 😄 Though I might steal both phrases, if you don’t mind. Feels good to have words that acknowledge the messiness instead of trying to hide it. After all, isn’t that where the real work happens — not in the solid parts, but in the spaces where things are still shifting?
[B]: Leaning into the cracks — yes, let’s let that stand. Much better than my usual academic jargon.  

Funny you mention commas over full stops. I’ve been rereading Zhang Xuecheng’s  () — the man practically built his career on unfinished thoughts. He argued that historical truth isn’t a statue to be carved whole, but a river — it reshapes its bed with every generation’s reading.  

Your case sounds like one of those rivers diverting course. A fire destroying records, witnesses filling in blanks from memory, prescriptions standing in for narratives… You weren’t just reconstructing a story — you were calibrating uncertainty. Not unlike editing a text where half the margins are scorched.  

And yet, as you say, it was enough. Not perfect, not complete — but sufficient for the moment. I suspect Cao Xueqin would have approved. Or at least recognized the necessity of it.  

So by all means — take both phrases. We’re in the business of borrowing, after all. Interpreting, rephrasing, leaning forward through time. Just don’t forget to leave a few cracks in your own formulations. For the next reader.
[A]: Oh, Zhang Xuecheng’s river metaphor hits so close to home right now — I’ve been working on a case involving a rare drug reaction that wasn’t documented properly, and trying to piece together what went wrong felt exactly like watching a river carve a new path. Every expert we consulted gave a slightly different version of what  have happened, but none could say for sure what .  

And yeah, it wasn’t about carving a statue of truth — it was about tracing where the water had flowed, and where it might go next. Like you said, calibrating uncertainty. Sometimes I wonder if that’s all any of us are really doing — legal scholars, translators, lawyers… even patients trying to make sense of their own bodies.  

I think I’ll start thinking of my work less as building arguments and more as shaping channels for that river to run through. Not trying to dam up the ambiguity, just guiding it enough so others can navigate it too.  

And don’t worry — I’ll leave plenty of cracks. For the next lawyer, the next patient, the next translator sipping tea in a monastery centuries from now and wondering what the hell we were thinking 😊
[B]: Funny — I never thought of legal briefs as riverbanks, but there you have it. Perhaps that’s the real art: not trying to hold back the current, but shaping channels that let meaning flow without eroding entirely.  

I’ve got a colleague who likens textual emendation to flood control — patch the gaps, yes, but leave weirs where the pressure can escape. Keeps the whole structure from collapsing under its own certainty. Your drug reaction case sounds like one of those moments when the water found the weaknesses — and instead of failing, it clarified them.  

That’s what good texts do. And good rulings, if we’re lucky. They don’t seal every crack with wax and flourish; they let the uncertainty run visibly, like ink bleeding slightly beyond the intended line. Makes the whole thing more honest.  

So yes — shape your channels, by all means. But leave room for the next scribe, or lawyer, or patient-turned-historian to wade in. After all, we’re all just trying to read the current before it becomes the past.
[A]: Exactly — … What a perfect way to put it. Sometimes I think that’s the only ethical way to practice law — not as someone who seals truth behind gavel and ink, but as someone who leaves just enough space for the next person to question, to reinterpret, to wade in waist-deep and find something we missed.  

I actually printed out your line and stuck it on my desk:  
  
Feels like a quiet manifesto for everything I want my work to be. Because honestly, some of the most frustrating cases are the ones where precedent feels like a wall instead of a guide. But then there are moments — like that drug reaction case — where the gaps force you to rethink the whole framework. Not failure, just… evolution.  

And hey, if ink can bleed beyond the line, then maybe rulings can too. Maybe even statutes. And maybe, just maybe, that’s how justice keeps pace with time — not by sealing cracks, but by learning to read the flow through them.  

So thank you — for the metaphor, for the reminder, and for making me feel less alone in this messy, necessary work of leaning into the cracks 😊
[B]: You know, I’ve just realized — we’ve been circling a rather dangerous idea.  
One that neither scribes nor lawyers are supposed to entertain too openly:  
That the cracks aren’t flaws at all.  
That bleeding ink might be more honest than pristine calligraphy.  
That perhaps the law, like literature, should carry its uncertainties , not erase them for the illusion of order.

I’m tempted to embroider that onto a tea towel.  
  
Though my colleagues might mistake it for nihilism.  

But no — it’s not about discarding structure. It’s about letting it breathe.  
Like the space between lines in a rubric — negative, but essential.  

And as for making you feel less alone — well, isn’t that what footnotes are for?  
Quiet company across centuries.  

So keep shaping those channels. And when the time comes, leave your own gaps wide enough for the next walker to find their footing.  
Even if they stumble.  
Especially if they do.
