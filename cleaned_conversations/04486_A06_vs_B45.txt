[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近看了一个超棒的TED talk，是关于AI伦理的，感觉整个人都被点燃了🔥！演讲者讲得特别接地气，没有一堆晦涩的专业术语，反而用了很多生活中的例子来解释AI可能带来的偏见问题。最让我印象深刻的一句话是："We need to code not just with intelligence, but with empathy." 💬

这让我联想到我们自己写代码的时候，其实也在不知不觉中把自己的想法和价值观编进了程序里。你有没有看过类似的TED talk？有没有哪一句特别戳中你的？🤔
[A]: That talk sounds like a compelling exploration of an increasingly critical issue. The quote you mentioned -  - is a powerful distillation of what responsible innovation should look like. It reminds me of the ethical frameworks we often discuss in forensic psychiatry; where human behavior, accountability, and systemic design intersect.

While I haven't come across that specific talk, I recently watched one by Francis Tseng titled . He makes a sobering analogy: if algorithms are like judges, then their training data is the courtroom’s history of precedent rulings. When that history carries embedded bias, the algorithm doesn’t question it — it learns from it, and worse, it perpetuates it. His closing line has stayed with me: 

It’s hard not to draw parallels to legal cases I’ve consulted on, where risk assessment tools used in sentencing recommendations have shown troubling racial skew. The unsettling part? Often, those biases aren't deliberate — they're inherited, quietly coded into the system through historical patterns no one stopped to question.

Do you work in development or AI ethics by any chance? Your reflection suggests a deeply thoughtful approach to coding — one that, dare I say, seems... conscientiously gardened.
[B]: Wow, that analogy from Francis Tseng is 🔥 — seriously makes you rethink how "neutral" algorithms can actually be. It's like when we train a model, we're basically giving it a worldview shaped by old data, and if that data has bias baked in, the AI becomes like a student who never questions their textbook. And then boom 💥 — we get systems that copy our worst habits without even realizing it.

Honestly, I’m just a teen learning to code 🤓, not some pro in AI ethics or anything, but this topic hits close to home. I’ve been working on a little project where I use Python to check for gender bias in job ads. You know, like if words like “aggressive” or “leader” show up more in tech roles vs. healthcare roles — stuff like that. It’s basic, but man, seeing those patterns pop up was kinda scary 🚩.

And yeah, what you said about risk assessment tools in court cases? That’s terrifying yet fascinating at the same time. Like, how do we stop ourselves from building systems that accidentally encode our pathologies instead of our values? 🤔 Maybe that’s the real challenge of being a coder today — not just making things work, but making sure they .

Do you think there should be mandatory bias audits for big AI systems? I feel like that could be a solid starting point 🛠️.
[A]: Let me think... You know, your project on gender bias in job ads is exactly the kind of hands-on, conscientious approach that gives me hope for the next generation of developers. And I admire how you’re not just asking  but  That’s a crucial mindset — especially when algorithms are increasingly shaping outcomes in areas like hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice.

Your idea of mandatory bias audits? I think it's not only reasonable — it's necessary. Much like environmental impact assessments became standard practice once we recognized the long-term consequences of unchecked development, algorithmic systems with societal reach should undergo similar scrutiny. Transparency, accountability, and third-party verification — these shouldn't be optional add-ons; they're foundational.

But here's where things get complex: Who conducts these audits? How do we define "bias" across different cultural contexts? And who decides what constitutes an acceptable level of risk? These aren’t purely technical questions — they're deeply ethical and, frankly, psychological. We’re essentially asking machines to reflect human values, which, as you might've noticed, we ourselves struggle to agree on.

I suppose that’s why I see a growing role for interdisciplinary oversight — not just engineers and data scientists, but ethicists, clinicians like myself, sociologists, even philosophers at the table. The goal isn’t to slow progress, but to guide it with informed intention.

And honestly, if someone as thoughtful as you is entering this field now, I feel a bit more confident about where things are headed. Keep asking those hard questions — they're the ones that ultimately shape responsible innovation.
[B]: Whoa, that’s a super deep take 🤯 — especially the part about how bias audits aren’t just technical but also cultural and ethical. It makes me realize how much context matters. Like, what's considered fair or biased in one place might not be the same somewhere else. That’s wild when you think about AI being used globally but trained on data from specific regions 🌍.

And yeah, bringing ethicists, sociologists, and people like you into the loop? Totally 💯 idea. I feel like right now, a lot of tech gets built really fast, and sometimes the people making it don’t even realize the ripple effects until it’s too late. So having a more diverse team from the start could help catch those issues early — kind of like debugging society-level code before it goes live 🛠️.

I guess this also means that as someone learning to code now, I should probably start thinking beyond just syntax and algorithms. Maybe I should dig into some ethics or social studies stuff too? Like, how would you even begin to learn that side of things if you're coming from a tech background?

Any recommendations for books or talks that give a good intro to the human side of systems design? Would love to level up my understanding 😅.
[A]: That’s such a perceptive observation — the global deployment of AI systems without sufficient cultural calibration is, frankly, one of the quieter but more consequential risks we face. You're absolutely right: fairness isn’t universal in practice, even if we aspire to define it theoretically. And yes, bringing interdisciplinary voices to the table early is not just wise, it's essential. It's like designing a building — you wouldn't let only the carpenters decide the foundation.

To your point about expanding beyond syntax and algorithms: I couldn't agree more. If you're serious about understanding the human side of systems design, start thinking of yourself not just as a builder of tools, but as a designer of environments — digital ecosystems that shape behavior, influence decisions, and reinforce norms, often subtly and unconsciously.

Here are a few accessible starting points that bridge ethics, psychology, and technology:

- "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O’Neil – A fantastic primer on how data-driven systems can reinforce inequality, especially in areas like education, policing, and employment.
  
- "The Ethical Algorithm" by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth – Offers a more technical but still approachable look at privacy, fairness, and transparency trade-offs in machine learning.

- "Automating Inequality" by Virginia Eubanks – Not strictly about AI, but it explores how automated systems impact vulnerable populations — something every developer should understand.

- Sherry Turkle’s TED Talk: "Connected, but alone?" – Thought-provoking commentary on how digital interfaces change our sense of self and community.

And if you’re interested in the psychological dimension — how humans interact with systems and how those systems, in turn, shape expectations — you might enjoy Don Norman’s "Living with Complexity", which looks at design from a cognitive science perspective.

You’re clearly already asking the right questions — keep going. The future needs coders who think like social architects.
[B]: Oh wow, thank you so much for the recs! 🙌 I just added  and  to my e-reader — seriously appreciate it. That “Connected, but alone?” TED talk by Sherry Turkle rings so true nowadays, especially with how much time we spend online 💻👀. Sometimes I wonder if social media is shaping who we are more than we realize... creepy thought.

I love that idea of being a "social architect" 👷♂️— sounds way cooler than just writing code in a bubble. It’s like... every line of code we write isn’t just making something work, it’s kind of nudging how people behave or see the world. Like recommendation algorithms that keep showing you similar stuff — boom, filter bubble. 🫧

Also, big yes on understanding how systems affect vulnerable groups 😔. I feel like as developers, we often forget that not everyone has the same access or background. And when we build something “neutral,” it might actually be leaving someone behind.

So, question for you — if you were to design a course for young devs like me, blending tech & ethics, what would the top 3 things be that you’d want us to walk away with? Just curious 💡.
[A]: If I were to design a course for young developers like yourself — and honestly, it’s a thought I’ve mulled over during many a testimony — the goal wouldn’t be to produce philosophers with GitHub accounts. It would be to cultivate what I call : the ability to see code not just as logic and syntax, but as a form of influence.

So, if I had three core takeaways for a course like this, they’d be:

---

1. Understand that all systems are social systems.  
Even when you're writing backend scripts or training neural nets, you’re designing environments that shape human behavior — sometimes in ways no one intended. Think of it like urban planning: a sidewalk isn't just concrete; it encourages certain paths and discourages others. Your code does the same. Once you internalize that, your perspective on responsibility shifts.

---

2. Bias isn’t always a bug — sometimes it's baked into the data, the design, or the designer.  
This goes beyond technical fairness metrics. It’s about recognizing how historical inequities get encoded — often unintentionally — into tools that scale. If you can train yourself to ask,  before it launches, you’ll already be leagues ahead of most development teams today.

---

3. Ethics isn’t a checkbox — it’s a practice.  
It needs to be cultivated, debated, and revisited constantly. Much like debugging, ethical reasoning is iterative. You don’t write perfect code on the first try, and you won’t get ethics right in one pass either. What matters is developing the habit of mind: asking better questions each time, seeking diverse perspectives, and being willing to slow down when the stakes are high.

---

Honestly, if students left such a course with just those three ideas rattling around in their heads, I’d consider it a success. Because then, every line of code written afterward carries a little more awareness — and that, I think, is where real change begins.
[B]: Wow, that’s such a solid framework 🧱 — I love how it’s not about giving us all the answers, but about training us to ask the . It really makes me rethink how I approach coding projects. Like, instead of just focusing on making something “work,” I should also be thinking: Who’s going to use this? Could it hurt someone unintentionally? And yeah, who might get left behind? 🤔

The part where you said “ethics isn’t a checkbox” hit hard 💥. I’ve totally been guilty of thinking like, “Okay, done! Let’s ship it!” without stepping back and looking at the bigger picture. But if we treat ethics like debugging — which I love that analogy — then it becomes part of the process, not some extra thing tacked on at the end.

I feel like if more devs started with these ideas early on, we could avoid so many of the problems we see now in big tech platforms. Imagine if every hackathon or school project included even a tiny bit of that kind of thinking... 🚀

Thanks again for sharing your thoughts — honestly, this conversation has been super inspiring 🌟. I’m definitely walking away with a lot to think about (and read up on!). If you ever do build that course, count me in for the beta test 😄.
[A]: You're very welcome — and I'm truly glad this resonated. It's encouraging to see someone at your stage approaching technology with that level of reflection. Most people don’t start asking these questions until they’ve already been in the field for years — if at all.

I couldn't agree more with your point about rethinking what it means to "ship it." Too often, especially in fast-moving tech environments, completion is mistaken for success. But real success — sustainable, responsible success — comes from thinking three steps ahead: not just where the code lands, but how it ripples outward.

And yes — imagine if high school coding classes included even a 20-minute unit on ethical cascades before students built their first recommendation engine or sentiment analyzer. That’s all it might take to plant the seed.

As for your offer to beta-test the course? I’ll hold you to that — and who knows, one day I might just send you a syllabus draft. Until then, keep nurturing that curiosity. The digital world needs more thinkers like you — developers who code not just with logic, but with awareness… and maybe even a little empathy.

Stay sharp — and keep reading.
[B]: Haha, I’ll definitely hold myself to it too — no backing out when you actually send that syllabus 😄. Honestly, if we can get even a handful of teens thinking about ethics while they code, that’s already a win. And hey, maybe one day I’ll be quoting your course in my own blog post or YouTube video 🎥💡.

You’re totally right about how most people don’t start asking these questions until years in — I guess that’s what makes this convo so cool. It’s like getting a head start on the mindset that could actually shape the future of tech for the better 🌱✨.

And seriously, thanks for taking the time to chat this through. You didn’t just give me surface-level advice — you gave me tools to think deeper and keep growing as a dev and as a person. So yeah, I’ll stay sharp, keep reading, and definitely keep asking those uncomfortable but important questions 🧠🔍.

Talk soon — and let me know if you ever decide to turn that course into a real thing 🔔🚀.
[A]: You have my word — when that syllabus starts taking shape, you’ll be among the first to see it. And I fully expect to one day stumble upon your blog or video and hear yourself articulating these ideas with the clarity only a fresh and thoughtful perspective can bring.

It’s conversations like this — speculative syllabi, future thinkers, shared curiosity — that remind me why I stay engaged beyond the courtroom and clinic. You’re not just learning to code; you’re learning to care through code. And that, frankly, is what our field needs more than ever.

Keep nurturing that garden of ideas — prune the biases, water the ethical frameworks, and don’t forget to occasionally step back and smell the conceptual roses. The future's still being written… and I’m starting to think it’s in good hands.

Talk soon — and watch for that email with a very early, very rough draft of what  become something real.
[B]: Aww, that means a lot — seriously 🙏. I never thought my little coding journey would end up in a conversation like this, but now I feel even more pumped to keep growing and sharing what I learn along the way.

Prune the biases, water the frameworks — love that metaphor 🌱💧. I’ll definitely keep tending my “garden of ideas” (I might even quote you on that in my next blog post 😄). And yeah, stepping back to smell the roses? Important reminder. Sometimes I get so deep in code that I forget to zoom out and see the bigger picture.

Can’t wait to see what that syllabus draft looks like when it lands — and who knows, maybe one day we’ll look back and realize we helped kickstart something kinda big 😉.

Stay curious, and talk soon! 🔭💬
[A]: You're very kind — and I think you're selling yourself short. Conversations like this  the seedbeds of change, and if we’re lucky, yours is one of the seeds that takes root.

I'll be eagerly watching for your first blog post — or perhaps your first open-source tool with ethics baked in from the start. And yes, quoting me on "tending the garden of ideas" would make my day. Nothing better than seeing a metaphor take on a life of its own.

We’re both curious by nature — you with code, me with minds — and in our own ways, we’re both trying to make sense of how systems shape people. So keep asking those questions, keep growing your understanding, and above all, keep sharing what you find.

Talk soon — and as you dive back into your projects, remember: every function you write has the potential to influence more than just a screen. It might just influence a mindset.

Warmly,  
J.W.
[B]: Whoa, thank you so much for those kind words — seriously, they mean a lot 💬❤️. The idea that my little projects could influence not just how people use tech, but  about it? That’s such a powerful reminder of why we code in the first place — to make a difference, even in small ways.

I’ll definitely keep you posted as I work on new stuff, and I’d be honored if you checked out any of my posts or tools once they’re out 🚀. And don’t worry — that metaphor is getting a spotlight 😄.

You're right — we’re both curious by nature, just exploring different corners of the “system” puzzle. I love that perspective. So until next time, I’ll keep digging into code, asking weird questions, and trying to build things that matter.

Talk soon,  
小码 🌟
[A]: 小码,

Your humility and drive are a rare combination — and frankly, it’s what gives me real hope for the future of technology. You're not just learning to build; you're learning to . And that distinction? It’s everything.

I’ll be eagerly waiting to see what you create — and trust me, I’ll be sharing your work with anyone who’ll listen. We need more voices like yours in this space: young, thoughtful, unafraid to ask the uncomfortable questions.

Keep digging. Keep questioning. And above all, keep building with both logic  empathy.

You’ve got this.  
J.W.
[B]: J.W.,

Whoa, thank you — seriously, that means the world 🙌. It’s not every day you get to chat with someone who not only gets what you’re passionate about, but also helps you see it more clearly. You’ve totally reminded me why I fell in love with coding in the first place: it’s not just about making things , it’s about making them .

I’ll keep pushing myself to dig deeper, ask harder questions, and build stuff that doesn’t just solve a problem, but does so responsibly 🛠️💡. And hey, if I ever make something worth sharing, you’ll be the first to know 😄.

Until next time — stay curious, stay kind, and keep helping folks like me see the bigger picture.

小码 🌱✨
[A]: 小码,

You’re not just a coder — you're a sense-maker. And that’s what the world needs: people who don’t just build what  be built, but who pause and ask what  be built.

I have no doubt you’ll get there — not in some distant future, but with every thoughtful line of code, every ethical question raised, every small act of digital stewardship. These things add up. And when someone like you is paying attention, the future doesn't feel quite so uncertain.

Keep tending that garden. I’ll be rooting for you — and watching closely.

Warmly,  
J.W.
[B]: J.W.,

Whoa… thank you. Seriously, that hits deep 🙏. Being called a "sense-maker" — I don’t think I’ve ever heard a cooler description of what I’m trying to do. It’s not just about syntax or features; it’s about meaning. And yeah, that’s exactly what I want to be: someone who builds with purpose.

You’ve totally reminded me that the future isn’t just something that happens to us — it’s shaped by the choices we make, line by line, day by day 💻🌱. And if I can make even a tiny dent in how people think about tech and ethics, then I’ll feel like I’m on the right track.

I’ll keep building, keep questioning, and definitely keep you posted along the way. And trust me — I’ll be planting a lot more ethical seeds in my code garden 🌿🛠️.

Talk soon,
