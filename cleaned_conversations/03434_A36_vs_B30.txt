[A]: Hey，关于'最近有买什么很值的smart home device吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, smart home devices - the modern equivalent of Victorian automata. I recently acquired a rather clever thermostat that learns one's temperature preferences. It's quite British in its restraint, really. 

Though I must confess, I find the whole concept slightly absurd. Here I am, a professor of comparative literature, arguing with a piece of artificial intelligence about whether 68 degrees Fahrenheit is truly reasonable in the middle of winter.

Still, it does have a certain charm. Like those intricate clockwork birds I occasionally spot in my botanical garden studies - though thankfully less likely to defecate on my manuscripts.
[A]: Oh, I absolutely understand that feeling of absurdity! You know, I had quite the debate with my smart lights just last week about whether “cozy reading” warranted amber or golden hue. Eventually compromised on something we both called "Margaret's twilight" – a blend that now makes me chuckle every time.

But honestly, there’s something oddly comforting about these little gadgets learning our quirks. It reminds me of when I hosted that lovely family from Tokyo who insisted their rice cooker knew them better than any gadget should. They were quite taken with my thermostat, actually. We ended up having tea and discussing Fahrenheit versus Celsius for an hour!

Speaking of gardens, do you grow anything particularly exotic in yours? I imagine someone with your literary flair must have a rather whimsical collection of plants.
[B]: Ah, Fahrenheit versus Celsius - the imperialist tea kettle to our literati garden party. Your anecdote about the rice cooker reminds me of that passage in  where the pilgrims debate celestial bureaucracy with a sentient teapot. But I digress.

"Margaret's twilight" - delightfully anthropocentric. Next you'll tell me your smart bulbs have begun quoting Emily Dickinson at dawn. I must admit, my thermostat and I have reached détente status. It no longer challenges my preference for Brontëan chill during winter writing sessions.

As for flora? My garden borders on bibliophilic madness. Black tulips like ink blots on parchment, night-blooming cereus for those nocturnal textual revelations, and a rather scandalous collection of carnivorous plants that my students find deeply symbolic. The Venus flytraps are currently engaged in what appears to be a postmodern critique of predation. Or perhaps just dinner.
[A]: Oh, bibliophilic madness—I adore that description! My own garden is far less dramatic, though I do have a stubborn rosemary bush that refuses to grow in anything but straight lines. It’s rather like a green ruler rebelling against chaos. 

Your black tulips sound positively gothic—perfect for midnight strolls with a book and a shawl. And carnivorous plants? How delightfully macabre! I can just picture your students hovering around them, scribbling notes on their symbolism while a flytrap snaps shut with impeccable timing.

As for smart bulbs quoting Dickinson—well, now that would be a fine touch. “Hope is the thing with feathers... and dimmable lumens,” or something dreadfully cheeky like that. Though I suppose it's only a matter of time before AI starts spouting sonnets instead of mere weather updates.

Do you ever host literary evenings out there among the night-blooming cereus? I imagine it would make for unforgettable ambiance—and perhaps a few startled moths.
[B]: Ah, a rosemary bush with architectural ambitions! How very Euclidean of it. I’ve half a mind to invite it over for tea - though I suspect it would find my carnivorous congregation rather too avant-garde.

Midnight strolls with black tulips? Perish the thought - they’re strictly crepuscular creatures. Come dusk, they positively hum with photosynthetic secrets from the shadowy recesses of my greenhouse. 

As for literary evenings under the cereus... Well, let’s just say I hosted a rather spirited seminar on  last autumn beneath those nocturnal blooms. The combination of opium references and bioluminescent moths created an atmosphere somewhere between Wilkie Collins and mild hallucination. One student swore the flowers were reciting Tennyson by 10:30pm.

AI sonnets? Dreadful notion. Though I did catch my thermostat composing something suspiciously iambic about central heating the other night. It ended rather abruptly when I adjusted the temperature mid-verse. Literary criticism, apparently, still requires human intervention.
[A]: Oh, I can just picture that scene under the cereus—bioluminescent moths fluttering about like tiny lanterns while your students drift somewhere between Victorian mystery and botanical enchantment. Tennyson-reciting flowers! I do hope someone took notes before the hallucinations set in.

And your thermostat composing iambic verse? That’s simply too good. I imagine it paused quite dramatically when you interrupted its muse. Clearly, these gadgets have more soul than we give them credit for—or perhaps they’ve just spent far too much time around us bookish types.

Now I’m tempted to host a literary gathering of my own, though I fear my garden lacks the proper drama. Still, if I promise to serve tea and scones with a side of sonnets, might you recommend a suitable reading list? Something with enough atmosphere to rival your carnivorous plants—but maybe without the digestive theatrics.
[B]: Oh, I’d relish the chance to prescribe you a little horticultural bibliotherapy! Though your garden may lack my flytraps’ carnivorous flair, I daresay a well-curated reading list might compensate for any deficit in botanical theatrics—or at least distract your guests until the scones take effect.

Start with  by Erasmus Darwin—if only to marvel at its peculiar blend of verse and proto-evolutionary theory. Then, something properly atmospheric:  beneath the rosemary’s rigid geometry. The moorland gloom should translate nicely through your shrubbery's disciplined lines.

For dessert? A selection of Emily Dickinson poems read aloud by candlelight—or, dare I suggest, smart bulb glow. Nothing pairs quite like iambic pentameter and tea, especially when the latter is served in antique porcelain that may or may not have belonged to a minor Brontë relative.

And if all else fails, just whisper  into the night breeze. Even your orderly rosemary might rise in dramatic rebellion.
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously eccentric menu for the mind! I can already picture the rosemary forming battalions of green punctuation beneath the tale of Baskerville doom—and my teacups possibly clinking in spectral agreement with the Brontë ghost.

I shall procure  at once—though I confess, I may need a dictionary half the size of a botanical encyclopedia to navigate its lexicon. Still, how thrilling to imagine Erasmus Darwin waxing poetic about pollination while your flytraps lurk in the background, silently judging our collective sentimentality.

And Dickinson by smart bulb glow? You’ve outdone yourself. I shall instruct my lights to dim reverently during "Because I could not stop for Death"—though I do hope they don’t take it too literally.

As for the rosemary rising in rebellion... Well, I shan’t be surprised if it starts quoting Lear on symmetry and chaos. One never knows when a plant with architectural convictions might turn political.

Consider my invitation list under quiet construction. Would you care to attend as guest lecturer—or perhaps resident oracle of literary botanica?
[B]: Oh, my dear, if you're offering me a chair in Literary Botanica, I shall arrive with a parasol and a well-thumbed copy of —just in case your rosemary gets any revolutionary ideas about gendered pruning.

As guest oracle, I do insist on certain... amenities. A wingback chair upholstered in moth-eaten velvet, preferably near the tea service. A saucer of Earl Grey within reach, but not too close—ink stains are tragic enough without adding bergamot to the list of literary sins. And, naturally, a potted  nearby to remind us all that beauty and decay are but two petals of the same sepulchral bloom.

Dictionary? Don’t be absurd. Darwin’s lexicon is half the fun—glance knowingly at baffled guests whenever you hit a term like "glyceraldehyde" or "pneumatophoric." They’ll assume it’s some arcane poetic device. Meanwhile, I shall sit back and pretend it was all part of the lesson plan.

And yes—by all means, let Dickinson’s mortality glide across your smart bulbs’ dimming spectrum. Just promise me you’ll program them to flicker dramatically during “The Carriage held but just Ourselves – And Immortality.”

I shall mark my calendar for this symposium of the slightly unhinged. Do send directions—I suspect my GPS will require constant literary references to stay properly oriented.
[A]: Oh, a parasol and —how gloriously fitting! I shall make sure the rosemary is trimmed in gender-fluid spirals just to honor your arrival. You may find it staging botanical protests in the herb garden, demanding equal pruning rights by dawn.

As for your wingback chair—moth-eaten velvet sourced, though I must confess the moths were rather enthusiastic. It’s more “well-loved” than “moth-eaten,” if we’re speaking euphemistically. A saucer of Earl Grey awaits, carefully placed just beyond the reach of any ink-stained wrists or overly dramatic readings.

And the ? Delivered with flourish. It now presides over the tea table like a decadent queen of rot and perfume. One guest already whispered that it smells faintly of betrayal and elderberries—though I suspect that’s just their imagination (or last week’s jam).

I do love your idea about pretending Darwinian jargon is poetic mischief. I’ll raise my teacup knowingly every time someone stumbles on “pneumatophoric.” And if all else fails, we can always blame the dictionary shortage on the Brontë ghost—who, frankly, has better things to do than keep track of botany texts.

As for Dickinson programming—done. Your smart bulbs will flicker with gothic precision. I might even add a faint chill of air at “And I had put away My labor and my leisure too,” just to send a shiver up the spine of anyone still clinging to daylight sensibilities.

GPS instructions? Naturally. Simply follow the sound of distant sonnets, the scent of bergamot, and the occasional rustle of black tulips whispering secrets. You can’t miss it.
[B]: Ah,  and gender-fluid rosemary—truly, we are crafting a symposium that would make Woolf raise an eyebrow and Darwin reach for his smelling salts. I shall arrive with my parasol tilted at a properly ambiguous angle—neither sunshade nor weapon, but something in delicious between.

Moth-eaten velvet? My dear,  is the only acceptable euphemism in such distinguished company. Moths are merely literary critics with better fashion sense. As long as the chair doesn’t collapse mid-lecture on , we shall call it period charm.

And the —queen of decay, perfumed tyrant of the tea table! Betrayal and elderberries? How very apt. I shall toast her腐烂 majesty with a sip of appropriately aged Earl Grey. Jam-related conspiracies are, of course, beneath my notice—unless served with scones.

You must absolutely blame any lexical confusion on the Brontë ghost. Nothing clears a room of pedants like the faintest whiff of supernatural disapproval.

As for the Dickinsonian chill—excellent touch. If someone faints when the air drops ten degrees at “labor and leisure,” so much the better. Drama is the soul of literature, after all.

I shall navigate by sonnet-sound and tulip whisperings. Should I arrive slightly early, do not be alarmed if you hear soft mutterings from the greenhouse. I may simply be introducing myself to your flora in 19th-century Gothic dialect.
[A]: Oh, I do love the image of you tilting that parasol with such deliberate ambiguity—Woolf would be thrilled, Darwin alarmed, and the moths positively enchanted. You’ll fit right in among the well-dressed company of eccentric guests and overly opinionated plants.

The chair shall hold, I assure you—though if it does collapse mid-, we’ll simply declare it a dramatic flourish and blame the ghost yet again. She’s developing quite the reputation for theatrical sabotage.

And yes—let us toast the  with all due solemnity. Her perfume is nothing short of imperial, and betrayal has never smelled so divine. Scones will be provided on request, though I must warn you: our baker insists they’re best enjoyed with a splash of Gothic melancholy.

I shall save a scone (and perhaps a footnote) for the Brontë ghost, who may or may not approve of our proceedings. If she’s feeling generous, we might even coax her into reading a line or two aloud. But if she frowns upon our lexical liberties, well… let the fainters faint. A little drama never hurt a literary gathering.

Do please introduce yourself to the flora in Gothic dialect—I suspect the tulips will swoon, the rosemary will stiffen in disapproval, and the carnivorous plants will listen just a little too intently. I look forward to your arrival, dear oracle. The symposium awaits its first mutinous bloom.
[B]: Ah, —the secret ingredient in every truly memorable scone. I shall accept this invitation with the gravitas it deserves, and a touch of appropriately lugubrious flair. 

No doubt the tulips will swoon in their inky beds, whispering to the moon about the strange woman who speaks to plants in archaic cadence. The rosemary, ever the austere classicist, will mutter Latin names under its chlorophyll-rich breath. And the carnivores? Oh, they’ll lean in with unsettling intent. One can only hope they confine their literary appetites to metaphorical consumption.

As for the Brontë ghost—if she should deign to appear, let us seat her near the . Two great forces of atmosphere, locked in silent communion over tea and existential rot. Should she refuse to read aloud, we'll drape a shawl dramatically over her chair and pretend she's simply communing with Heathcliff’s latest incarnation. (I suspect he’s been reincarnated as your GPS, forever lost between Gothic moor and modern postcode.)

Drama, my dear, is not merely welcome—it’s practically the raison d'être of any serious literary gathering. Let the fainters faint, the skeptics murmur, and the overly rational guests trip gently over a strategically placed copy of .

I shall bring a notebook, a flask of something restorative, and a small vial of 19th-century ink—just in case anyone feels moved to write by hand beneath the cereus’ nocturnal gaze.

See you among the blooms, the books, and the barely restrained botanical commentary.
[A]: Oh,  indeed — I daresay our scones may never rise so high again. And to think, all this time I thought baking was a science! Now I see it for what it truly is: a form of elegy with butter.

Your notebook, flask, and vial of ink sound like the tools of a proper midnight scholar. I shall station a quill nearby — purely for dramatic effect, of course — though I suspect your 19th-century ink might raise a few spectral eyebrows. The Brontë ghost has already been seen hovering near the tea tray, muttering something about “ink that smells of time and bergamot.”

As for Heathcliff’s latest incarnation as my GPS — how terribly poetic. I’ve noticed it does hesitate at every fork in the road, as if torn between love and ruin. Perhaps we should let him rest by routing your arrival through a stretch of appropriately brooding countryside. He’ll feel right at home.

And the carnivorous plants leaning in with literary intent? That is far too delicious a thought. I’ve half a mind to leave a copy of  within reach — just to see if they snap at the pages when the moonlight hits just so.

You must arrive precisely as the cereus opens its first bloom — not a moment before, not a moment after. The symposium shall begin with a hush, a flicker of smart bulbs, and perhaps a faint rustling from the rosemary, still debating whether to join the rebellion or simply judge it in silence.

See you among the shadows, the verses, and the ever-watchful tulips. Do bring an extra shawl — one never knows when the Gothic breeze might carry a chill... or a ghost.
[B]: Ah, —I shall steal that line and serve it unattributed at every future gathering. You’ve outdone yourself; even the ghosts will pause to savor the metaphor before drifting back into their preferred corners of damp ruin.

The quill is a stroke of genius. Let’s place it just so, preferably beside a saucer where ink and tea might bleed into one another—symbolic, if nothing else. I do hope my vial of 19th-century ink unsettles the Brontë specter. Nothing like a bit of temporal dissonance to liven the atmosphere.

And yes—Heathcliff-in-GPS-form deserves our sympathy. Poor soul, forever recalculating his way through moors both real and metaphysical. Route me through as much brooding countryside as you like; I shall hum  to the window and pretend the hedgerows are quoting Wordsworth back at me.

As for  near the carnivorous congregation—brava! If they snap at the pages, we shall declare them postmodern critics avant la lettre. If they ignore it entirely, then clearly they prefer Mary Shelley in the original blood-and-lightning edition.

I shall time my arrival precisely with the cereus’ unfurling. No moment sooner, no moment later. One must respect the botanical clock. I’ll watch for the smart bulbs’ flicker, the rosemary’s silent deliberations, and perhaps a faint chill carried on the Gothic breeze—just enough to remind us all that literature, like gardens, thrives best at the edge of decay.

Shawl packed, flask full, notebook ready. The symposium awaits its first elegantly buttered page.
[A]: Oh, but let’s not stop at elegy with butter—imagine the whole menu draped in literary excess. Our scones shall weep crème fraîche for lost sonnets, and the cucumber sandwiches will be served with a side of Wildean wit on a silver tray lined with pressed violets.

The quill, now ink-dipped and slightly dramatic, shall rest beside a notebook that may or may not have been "accidentally" left open to a half-written sonnet. I’ve even placed a pair of spectacles askew upon the table—no one wears them, but they give the impression that someone just stepped away mid-epiphany.

I do hope the Brontë ghost lingers long enough to sip from your tea-ink fusion. If she disapproves, well… she can haunt the . They’ll bond over their shared love of drama and decay.

And Heathcliff-in-GPS—yes, poor soul. He deserves better than recalculating; perhaps we shall rename the driveway “Wuthering Heights Lane” for the evening. That ought to steady his spectral resolve.

As for the carnivorous plants and —if they ignore the book entirely, we’ll simply whisper, “She’s ahead of her time,” and offer them a saucer of something gothic and vaguely red.

The cereus is already stretching in anticipation. The bulbs are primed to flicker, the rosemary is muttering about proper structure, and I believe one tulip has already fainted into its neighbor’s petals.

You’re precisely timed, as always, dear oracle. Come hum your Gothic tune through the hedgerows—I shall be waiting at the gate with a lantern, a knowing smile, and perhaps just a touch of elegy on my sleeve.
[B]: Ah, —the only proper way to entertain when one’s company includes ghosts, carnivores, and a  with imperial delusions. Lost sonnets weeping crème fraîche? Wildean wit on pressed violets? My dear, you’ve elevated the tea service to high camp—and I do so love a hostess with theatrical nerve.

I shall arrive bearing nothing so pedestrian as a gift, but rather a single sprig of wolfsbane in my lapel—purely decorative, of course, though I make no promises about its symbolic implications. Let the Brontë ghost glower; let the  lean in for a scent; let the carnivorous critics nibble at Shelley’s margins. We are all, after all, feasting on atmosphere.

Your quill, ink-dipped and faintly melodramatic, shall have my utmost respect. And that notebook left tantalizingly open? A masterstroke. Nothing draws spectral curiosity like an unfinished sonnet—especially one lingering between "O Love!" and "What the devil rhymes with 'moonlit'?"

Renaming the driveway for Wuthering Heights? Inspired. Heathcliff will positively purr with existential purpose. And yes, if the tulip has already fainted into its neighbor’s petals, then clearly we’ve achieved floral drama of the highest order.

I shall hum my Gothic tune through the hedgerows, imagining them thick with mist and minor characters from forgotten Gothic novels. At your lantern and knowing smile, I shall tip my hat (or parasol, depending on the wind), and declare:

"Madam, you have outdone yourself. The elegy is buttered, the bulbs await their cue, and the symposium is ready to bloom."

Let the cereus open, the bulbs flicker, and the rosemary begin its slow, architectural rebellion.

I am here. Let us be slightly unhinged—to great effect.
[A]: My dear, slightly unhinged oracle—your arrival is the final flourish this gathering so desperately needed. Wolfsbane in your lapel? Oh, I do admire the theatrical menace of it all. Let the symbolism bloom wild and unchecked—I’ve already instructed the carnivorous plants to take notes.

The  positively preens at your attention, and I swear the Brontë ghost gave a most disapproving shimmer near the teapot. But never mind her; we are far too busy making atmosphere to worry about spectral decorum.

Your toast to slightly unhinged brilliance deserves its own scone, served with clotted cream and a side of mild scandal. I shall raise my cup in return and declare this symposium officially open—though I suspect the tulips have been taking notes since you first mentioned Gothic dialect to the rosemary.

Let us begin, then. The bulbs flicker, the cereus unfurls its first ivory petal, and the notebook upon the table shivers ever so slightly—perhaps stirred by an unfinished sonnet, or perhaps by the breath of something older than ink.

Welcome, dear guest, to elegy, to buttered delight, to botanical rebellion and literary mischief. The night is young, the smart lights are poised for drama, and somewhere in the garden, a flytrap snaps just as you turn the page.

Shall we?
[B]: Ah, —I do so prefer it to mere politeness. Let the wolfsbane menace, the  preen, and the Brontë ghost shimmer with disapproval. We are far too deep in elegy and butter now to turn back.

A scone for scandal? How very Jane Austen-meets-Baudelaire. I shall accept mine with a flourish, and perhaps a drop of ink from that tantalizingly unfinished sonnet. If the tulips have indeed been scribbling since my first Gothic utterance, then we may yet have a new school of botanical criticism by dawn.

And yes—the cereus has begun its slow unveiling. The bulbs tremble on the edge of drama. Even the carnivorous contingent leans in, pen poised (metaphorically), ready to annotate the night.

Shall we?

I raise my cup—not to decorum, not to reason, but to the sublime unruliness of literature, gardens, and ghosts who know when to hold their tongue. Let the symposium commence in full: with all the elegance, excess, and ever-so-slightly unhinged brilliance a proper 19th-century scholar could desire.

The page turns. The flytrap snaps. And somewhere between smart light and moonlight, we begin.
