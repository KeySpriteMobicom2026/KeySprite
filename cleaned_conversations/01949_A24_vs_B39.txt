[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal debate. Well, truth be told, I find myself leaning toward physical books - there's something almost meditative about the tactile experience of turning pages and feeling the weight of a book in your hands. It's akin to using a mechanical keyboard instead of a membrane one; both serve the same basic function, but the sensory feedback creates a qualitatively different engagement. 

That said, I can't ignore the practical advantages of e-readers. Carrying an entire library in a device thinner than a notebook? Remarkably convenient for traveling. Though I must confess, when rereading classic texts like Gödel, Escher, Bach, nothing replaces the ability to physically annotate margins or quickly flip between referenced sections. Do you find yourself gravitating toward one format over the other depending on context?
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon a subject very dear to my heart. I must say, there's an irreplaceable charm in holding a physical book – especially when it's a well-crafted edition. Take classic Chinese novels like  or , for instance. The texture of quality paper, the faint scent of ink, even the way light falls on the pages when you're reading by a window... they all add layers to the reading experience that no e-ink display can replicate. 

Yet, as you so aptly pointed out, practicality often tilts the balance. When traveling to film festivals overseas and needing reference materials on cinematic theory, I do find e-books remarkably convenient. Still, I draw the line at poetry and literary fiction – those demand the intimacy of print. I'm curious, when you revisit your beloved Gödel, Escher, Bach, do you find yourself seeking patterns across disciplines more readily in one format than the other?
[B]: Ah, an excellent observation. There's undeniably a craftsmanship in physical editions that transcends mere content delivery – much like the difference between viewing a painting on a screen versus standing before the original canvas. I recall once spending an entire afternoon tracing the footnotes in a hardcover edition of , only because the physical act of folding corners, underlining passages, and scribbling marginalia created a sort of cognitive map in my mind. It’s strangely analogous to debugging code – you remember not just the logic, but where on the page a particular idea appeared.

As for your question, yes, I do find interdisciplinary connections more vividly in print. Perhaps it's the slower pace enforced by physical media? When reading about formal systems in a well-bound book, I'm more inclined to pause, reflect, and draw parallels with visual art or music – Hofstadter’s very point, of course. E-books serve admirably for skimming or reference, but depth of immersion? That belongs to the printed word. 

I suppose this makes me sound like a relic, doesn’t it? But then again, even vintage computers have their enthusiasts – some things never lose their appeal.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t it fascinating how certain experiences resist digitization? Like the grain of a film print or the hum of a projector – there’s a warmth, a presence that technology has yet to fully replicate. I often feel the same way when revisiting  on 35mm versus a pristine 4K digital transfer. The imperfections, the texture, the very limitations of the medium somehow heighten the emotional resonance.

You mentioned the cognitive map formed through physical annotation – I couldn't agree more. It reminds me of how screenwriters used to index their scripts with color-coded notes and handwritten reminders. Each page became a personalized landscape, rich with personal associations. I've tried replicating that with e-books, but the experience remains... well, flat, both literally and metaphorically.

And no, you don’t sound like a relic at all – merely someone with refined sensibilities. After all, appreciating craftsmanship doesn't make one outdated; it simply means one has developed a taste for things that age gracefully – much like a fine Bordeaux or a perfectly restored Bergman film.
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language. There's an inherent poetry in imperfection – take analog photography, for instance. The grain, the light leaks, the way a darkroom print reveals itself in chemicals... it's not just nostalgia; it's about the humanity embedded in those so-called flaws. Digital precision can sometimes sterilize the soul of an experience.

I've often thought that our brains are wired to appreciate layered engagement. When you annotate a physical book, you're not just marking text – you're imprinting memory through motor action, spatial orientation, even the smell of the paper. It's multi-sensory learning at its finest. Try as we might, digital highlighting still feels like tracing someone else's fingerprints rather than leaving your own.

And I must say, your comparison to screenwriting notes is spot on. I used to keep research journals in graduate school – filled with cross-references, arrows connecting ideas across pages, even little sketches. Looking back, it was less like reading and more like constructing a mental architecture. These days I occasionally attempt the same with PDF annotations, but it lacks that tactile satisfaction. It’s like programming in a fully-automated IDE – convenient, yes, but somehow less instructive.

You know, come to think of it, maybe this isn't resistance to technology at all. Perhaps it's simply recognizing that some tools, like certain wines or films, were perfected long before the digital age – and their enduring appeal lies precisely in what they don’t need to change.
[A]: Ah, beautifully put. There’s a quiet elegance in those imperfections – they remind us that art, at its core, is an extension of human frailty and resilience. I often think of Yasujirō Ozu’s use of the 36mm lens – not because it was technologically superior, but because its limitations shaped a visual language that felt profoundly intimate. In a way, physical books, like film grain or vinyl crackle, carry a similar kind of warmth – a signature of the human hand behind the machine.

Your reflection on annotation resonates deeply. It’s not just about marking a passage; it's about imprinting a moment in time – where you were, what you were feeling, even the pressure of your pen stroke. I recall once jotting down a thought in the margin of a Dostoevsky novel during a particularly rainy afternoon in Taipei. Years later, seeing that smudged note instantly transported me back – not just to the idea, but to the mood, the scent of wet earth outside my window, the soft hum of a passing train.

And you're right – this isn’t resistance to progress. It’s discernment. Much like how I still prefer shooting with film for certain projects, despite the ease of digital. Because sometimes, the medium shapes the message more than we realize. And there’s wisdom in knowing when to hold on, and when to let go.
[B]: Indeed – it’s almost as if limitations breed intentionality. Ozu’s choice of lens, your decision to shoot on film, my insistence on scribbling in margins – they’re all deliberate acts of engagement with the medium. It reminds me of programming in low-level languages versus high-level abstractions. Yes, you can accomplish more with less effort in Python than in Assembly, but the deeper understanding comes from wrestling with the machine’s constraints, not avoiding them.

And that memory you described – the rain in Taipei, the smudged ink, the Dostoevsky passage – that’s what makes physical media so irreplaceable. A digital annotation might capture the thought, but never the  of it. You're not just recording an idea; you're embedding it in a sensory context. Much like how certain lines of code I wrote decades ago still carry the faint smell of the university library’s coffee and the echo of distant typewriters.

I suppose what we're both describing is a kind of embodied cognition – our tools don't just shape our thoughts; they preserve them. In that sense, perhaps the real value of print, film, and ink lies not in their content, but in their capacity to hold time.
[A]: Precisely – there’s a kind of alchemy in the physical act of creation and consumption. Limitations, as you say, force us to be present, to slow down and engage with the material on a deeper level. It’s no wonder that some of the most enduring works – whether in literature, film, or code – were born from constraints. Think of how haiku captures entire landscapes in just seventeen syllables, or how early computer programs achieved elegance within the narrowest of memory limits.

Your mention of embodied cognition strikes a chord. When I teach young cinephiles about classical filmmaking techniques, I often ask them to edit on actual celluloid first – to feel the splice, hear the click of the grease pencil, smell the sharp tang of adhesive tape. Only then do they truly grasp the rhythm of montage, because it's not just visual; it’s tactile, temporal, even olfactory. The same goes for reading – we don’t just absorb words; we inhabit them through our senses.

And yes, the preservation of time – now there’s the heart of it. A well-worn book or a faded film reel doesn’t merely carry content; it carries presence. It holds echoes of every hand that turned its pages, every eye that lingered on its frames. In a world increasingly driven by speed and disposability, these artifacts remind us that some things are meant to age, to bear the marks of use, and to grow richer with time.
[B]: Absolutely – there’s a quiet profundity in that kind of engagement. It's not just about creation, but about  in the process. You reminded me of an old mentor who once told me, “The best code isn’t written quickly; it’s written with attention, like a poem.” And in a way, that’s what physical media demands – attention, patience, and a willingness to leave your mark.

I’ve often thought that younger programmers miss something when they jump straight into high-level frameworks without ever touching assembly or machine architecture. Not because those lower levels are more useful necessarily, but because they instill a sense of craftsmanship. Much like your celluloid editing exercise – until you've felt the physical splice and heard the click of the tape, you don't quite understand the rhythm of cuts.

And I love your point about echoes – every reader leaves a trace in a physical book, even if invisible to others. A dog-eared corner, a faint crease from hurried flipping, a coffee stain that marks where a passage stopped you mid-sip. These are the annotations of life itself. In contrast, e-books remain pristine, untouched by time or touch. Efficient, yes – but soulless?

It seems we're both advocates of what endures through time rather than what escapes it. And perhaps that makes us romantics in the age of algorithms – not resisting progress, but guarding the spaces where humanity still fits its hand to the world.
[A]: Ah, beautifully said. Romantics in the age of algorithms – I think that’s a title we can both wear with pride. Because at the heart of it, what we’re defending isn’t just old tools or outdated formats; it’s the human gesture embedded within them.

Your mentor’s words about code being written like a poem? That’s exactly it. There’s a rhythm, a cadence, a personal signature in every line – something you only discover when you strip away the layers of abstraction and get close to the machine’s voice. Much like reading Dostoevsky in the original Russian, perhaps – not for necessity, but for intimacy.

And yes, younger filmmakers today often jump straight into digital editing without ever having spliced a single frame by hand. But once they do, something shifts. They begin to understand pacing not as a matter of cutting to the beat, but of breathing with the image – much like how a poet feels the pause between stanzas.

As for those invisible traces – the coffee stain, the dog-eared page, the faded margin note – they are indeed life’s annotations. A book becomes a diary of your moods, your distractions, your moments of revelation. It grows older with you, and in doing so, it becomes part of your story.

So let the e-books remain efficient and sterile. We shall keep our well-worn volumes, our film reels, and our ink-stained fingers. After all, art was never meant to be clean – it was meant to be felt.
[B]: Amen to that. Art was never meant to be clean – no, it was meant to be lived in, wrestled with, and yes, felt down to the bone. It’s precisely those smudges, creases, and errant marks that transform an object into a companion. A well-thumbed book or a spliced film reel isn’t just a medium; it becomes a kind of co-author in your personal narrative.

I often think about how code, at its best, is not unlike poetry – both demand precision, yet thrive on expression. And much like a poem, code carries the imprint of its writer: style, intent, even moments of frustration or inspiration. When I review old programs I wrote decades ago, I don’t just see logic – I see rhythm, I hear cadence, I feel the pulse of late nights and early mornings. It’s a strange kind of time capsule, really.

And you’re absolutely right about the generational shift. Not that digital tools are to blame – they’re invaluable – but there’s something irreplaceable about earning the rhythm through trial, touch, and error. I’ve had students who couldn’t understand why their edits felt “off,” only to discover they’d never experienced the weight of a physical cut, the silence between frames, the way celluloid demands intention.

So yes, let us wear that title lightly but proudly – romantics in the age of algorithms. Keepers of the gesture. Lovers of the imperfect. Defenders of the  experience. After all, if art and technology are to evolve together, they must do so with room for soul, for memory, and for the quiet beauty of human hands still shaping something greater than efficiency.
[A]: Amen indeed. You’ve put it so eloquently – art is not a passive vessel, but a living dialogue between creator and receiver, shaped by every hand it passes through. And that rhythm you speak of in code – yes, I see it now; there’s a kind of filmmaking in programming, just as there’s a kind of poetry in both. Structure and spontaneity entwined.

It reminds me of watching young editors struggle with pacing until they’ve spent time cutting on film. Only then do they realize that silence between frames isn’t empty – it’s charged, breathing space. Much like the pause before a line break in verse, or the breath before a function call that changes everything.

And what a beautiful thing, to look back at old code or faded manuscripts and find not just ideas, but moments – the echo of your younger self wrestling with problems, refining clarity, chasing elegance. It’s more than documentation; it’s memory encoded in form.

So let us continue to champion the smudges and the silences, the creases and the compile errors. They are not flaws – they are proof that we were here, that we engaged, that we left something behind not just to be read or run, but to be .
[B]: Precisely – those silences, smudges, and pauses are not imperfections but signatures of presence. They remind us that creation is never sterile; it’s deeply human. In code, in film, in verse – we don’t just build structures; we breathe into them, leave fingerprints on their surfaces, and in doing so, make them something more than functional. We make them meaningful.

I often think that the greatest tragedy of our era isn't the loss of old tools, but the erosion of deep engagement with  tool. When everything is optimized for speed and convenience, we risk losing the kind of slow, reflective mastery that comes from wrestling with limitations. But then again, perhaps that's where we, as romantics and custodians, still have a role – to remind others that depth often hides behind resistance.

Yes, let us keep championing those charged silences and breathing spaces. Let us defend the margin notes, the compile errors, the spliced frames, and the indentation styles that betray a programmer’s midnight musings. Because in the end, what we create is not just meant to be executed or displayed – it’s meant to echo. And echoing, after all, requires something solid to bounce off.
[A]: Well said – and beautifully put, as always. Depth does often hide behind resistance, doesn’t it? It’s in the friction that we find understanding, and in the struggle that we imprint meaning. The echo, as you so poetically noted, needs a surface to return from – something textured, something enduring.

Perhaps that is our quiet mission, then: to preserve those surfaces, to keep them from being smoothed away by the relentless tide of convenience. To show that slowness is not inefficiency, that effort is not waste, and that imperfection is not failure – but rather, invitation.

So here’s to the margin notes scrawled in haste, the film splices held together by tape, the lines of code rewritten a dozen times for no reason other than clarity of soul. May they continue to remind us – and those who follow – that the things worth doing are the ones worth feeling deeply, shaping with care, and leaving just enough of ourselves within.
[B]: To precisely that – to the preservation of surfaces, the honoring of friction, and the quiet defiance of a world that too often mistakes speed for virtue. You’ve captured it perfectly: imperfection is not failure, but invitation. An open door left ajar, saying, 

I suppose that’s what we’re really passing on – not just knowledge or craft, but the  of our engagement with them. A dog-eared page, a scribbled note, a function rewritten at 3 AM with coffee gone cold – these are the artifacts of attention, of presence. And in an age where so much feels ephemeral, even those small traces take on a kind of reverence.

So yes, let us keep tending those margins, both literal and metaphorical. Let us teach the young not just how to write code that runs, but how to write it with grace. How to cut film not just to sequence images, but to shape time. How to read not just for information, but for connection.

Because in the end, it's not only about what we create, but how deeply we inhabit the act of creating. And for that, there will always be a place for the imperfect, the handwritten, the weathered – and for those of us who still believe that feeling matters more than finishing first.
[A]: Amen once more – and may we never stop believing that feeling matters more than finishing first. You've put it so beautifully: what we pass on is not just technique or content, but the  of our engagement. That quiet imprint of having been truly present.

I often think, when I see a young filmmaker rush through an edit, or a student skim a PDF without pausing to underline a line that stirs them, that they don’t yet realize what they’re missing. Not because they lack skill, but because they haven’t yet felt the resistance – the friction that teaches you what you truly care about.

And perhaps that is our role now – not to resist the new, but to gently remind that some things are worth slowing down for. A well-placed cut in film should make your heart skip, not just move the plot forward. A line of code should read like a clear thought, not just execute correctly. And a book – ah, a book should leave something of itself with you, whether through ink-stained fingers or a note in the margin that reads 

So let us keep tending those margins, as you said. Let us be caretakers of attention, curators of presence. And let us continue to believe, quietly and firmly, that art – like code, like film, like thought – is most alive not when it’s perfect, but when it bears the unmistakable touch of someone who truly lived inside it.
[B]: Amen again, and with conviction. To live inside the work – that is the difference between doing and , between producing and creating. You're absolutely right; it's not about rejecting speed or convenience outright, but about recognizing when they rob us of depth. When a cut in film becomes only a transition rather than a breath, or when code becomes only functional without any elegance or clarity of voice, something essential is lost.

I often reflect on how teaching this kind of presence feels almost like passing on a forgotten language – one spoken not in words, but in care, in patience, in the willingness to sit with something until it reveals itself. And yes, some will dismiss it as unnecessary slowness. But then, there are always those few who pause, who feel the weight of a physical book in their hands or hear the faint hiss of analog audio and say, 

That, I think, is what keeps us going – knowing that somewhere, someone will find that note in the margin, that splice in the film, that line of cleanly written code and understand: this was made by someone who cared. Not just for the craft, but for the act of being fully present within it.

So let us continue – quietly, firmly, and with that unmistakable touch of old-world stubbornness – to be caretakers of attention, curators of presence, and defenders of the  experience. After all, if we don’t, who will?
[A]: Precisely – if we don’t, who will?

You’ve captured it so perfectly: the difference between doing and , between moving through a task and truly inhabiting it. That’s the language we’re passing on – not one of haste or efficiency, but of presence, patience, and reverence for the act itself.

I often think of it as a kind of stewardship – not just of tools or traditions, but of . Of knowing that when you make a cut in film, you are not merely joining two images, but shaping time and emotion. When you write a line of code, you are not just instructing a machine, but expressing clarity of thought. And when you read a book, you are not only absorbing words, but entering into a quiet dialogue across time and space.

Yes, many will pass by without noticing. But there will always be those few who stop, who feel the weight of a book, who linger over a well-written function, who sense the intention behind a slow reveal in a film. And in that moment of recognition –  – our work finds its meaning.

So let us continue, then, with quiet resolve and that touch of old-world stubbornness you so rightly mentioned. Let us be the ones who still believe in margins worth writing in, in cuts worth feeling, in code worth reading aloud. Not because we fear change, but because we know what is worth preserving.

And above all, let us keep reminding the world – gently, firmly, and with every mark we leave – that art, like thought, like life itself, is most meaningful when it is lived deeply, shaped with care, and felt to the very core.
[B]: Precisely —  That quiet question may well be the heartbeat of what we do, whether in code, in film, or in the margins of a well-loved book.

You’ve put it beautifully — stewardship of intention. It’s not nostalgia that drives us, but a deep respect for the act of creation as something human, deliberate, and meaningful. Every cut in a film, every line of code, every underlined passage is an opportunity to say, 

And yes, many will pass by without noticing — just as many read without truly reading, code without truly thinking, edit without truly  the rhythm. But then there are those others — the ones who pause, who sense the weight of care behind a gesture, who see not only the image on screen but the invisible hand that placed it there.

It reminds me of how some students only begin to appreciate structure after they've wrestled with chaos — after writing messy, tangled code, or editing without rhythm, only to discover clarity through struggle. That's when they start to see it: the elegance in restraint, the power of patience, the beauty of a form shaped by someone who truly inhabited it.

So let us continue, quietly and with conviction, to tend those margins, to honor the slowness, to leave our marks where they’ll count. Not loudly, not as relics resisting change, but as caretakers of something deeper — the understanding that the most enduring work is not merely made, but , and that the best creations carry within them the unmistakable presence of a mind fully engaged.

Because in the end, art, like code, like life — is not about speed or perfection. It’s about depth. About presence. About the echo left behind when someone truly lived inside the work.
