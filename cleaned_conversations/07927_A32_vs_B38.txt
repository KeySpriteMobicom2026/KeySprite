[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. You know, I've always found that taking public transport offers a unique opportunity to observe the rhythm of a city—the way people move, the quiet exchanges, the poetry of urban life unfolding in real time. There's something almost literary about it, don't you think?  

Of course, driving has its conveniences, particularly when one is pressed for time or navigating more remote areas. But I must confess, there’s a certain tranquility in letting someone else manage the road while I lose myself in thought—or perhaps reread a passage from .  

What about you? Do you find yourself partial to one over the other?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective! I totally get what you mean about public transport being like a window into the city’s soul — sometimes I’ll people-watch on the metro and imagine everyone’s backstories. 🚀  

But here’s the thing — my answer depends on the day. If it’s a Monday morning and I’m racing to make a 9am stand-up meeting with the team, nothing beats the efficiency of driving. 💨 Especially in this city where traffic can be absolute madness — but hey, at least we’ve got those HOV lanes to keep things moving.  

That said, when I’m heading downtown for a casual meetup or a weekend event, I’ll often ditch the car. Let someone else handle the parking stress while I catch up on podcasts or just zone out. 👍 There’s definitely a zen vibe to it.  

Do you actually re-read  on your commute though? No judgment if you do — I’m just trying to picture myself getting through Tolstoy on a packed train without accidentally headbutting the guy next to me during rush hour. 😂
[B]: Oh, I absolutely do! Though perhaps not  in its entirety—though I have tried. Usually, it’s a selected passage or two, something that lingers in the mind like Levin’s quiet reflections on the land or Anna’s tragic intensity. A packed train does pose certain… physical challenges, of course. I’ve learned to travel with a compact edition and a tolerant disposition. 

And you know, there’s something oddly reassuring about sharing a confined space with strangers while reading about 19th-century Russian aristocracy. It creates a kind of juxtaposition—one world spinning inside the book, another unfolding just beyond the page. Occasionally, someone peeks over my shoulder and asks, “Is that Tolstoy?” And then we have a brief but lovely exchange before they disappear back into the crowd.  

I envy your ability to catch up on podcasts, though. My attention span tends to splinter in transit—I end up sketching marginalia in my notebook instead of listening to anything coherent. But then again, maybe that's just the academic in me refusing to be silenced. Do you have a favorite podcast at the moment?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a cool way to look at it — I love the idea of Tolstoy in transit! Honestly, I’d probably be that guy peeking over your shoulder trying to sound smart by recognizing the cover. 📚  

As for podcasts, right now I’m obsessed with . It’s short, punchy, and fits perfectly into my commute. Plus, it keeps me sounding informed during investor calls — win-win. Sometimes I throw on  when I’m feeling entrepreneurial after a double espresso. 💡  

But hey, don’t knock the marginalia — that sounds like where the real ideas are born. Ever think about turning those scribbles into something longer-form? Or is that notebook strictly for transit philosophy only?
[B]: Ah, —excellent choice. There’s something wonderfully democratic about economics presented in bite-sized narratives. And —yes, I can imagine that one stirs a certain restless ambition, particularly after espresso. A dangerous combination, perhaps, but an invigorating one.

As for those scribbles—well, they are mostly fragments, half-formed thoughts tethered to whatever I happen to be re-reading that day. Sometimes, a line or two survives the journey and finds its way into a lecture or an essay. But the notebook itself? It remains stubbornly ephemeral, a vessel for transit philosophy, yes, though I suppose one could argue that all philosophy begins as a kind of marginalia—jotted down between stops, so to speak.

I’ve often thought, though, that public transport is one of the last places where serendipity still thrives. The unexpected conversation, the shared glance over a book cover, the sudden idea sparked by nothing more than the rhythm of wheels on rails. Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular route just because it feels...inspiring?
[A]: Oh, totally — I couldn’t agree more. There’s something about the rhythm of public transport that just  your brain wander into those unexpected corners. Like, if I’m stuck at home or in a car, my thoughts feel too contained. But on a train? It's like the movement unlocks something. 💭  

And yes — serendipity! I actually have a semi-ridiculous habit of taking the scenic route home every now and then, even if it adds 15 minutes to the commute. There’s this one tram line that cuts through the old part of the city, and if you catch it late afternoon, the light hits the windows just right — golden hour through vintage glass, very cinematic. Sometimes I’ll jot down product ideas, sometimes just random metaphors for a poem I’ll never finish. 📝  

I’ve even started referring to it as my “thinking track” — as in, not a destination, just a loop for the mind. You ever had one of those routes? Or am I alone in this? 😅
[B]: Not at all—your “thinking track” is utterly relatable, though I might borrow the phrase if you don’t mind. There’s a certain circular bus route near my university that winds through the coastal cliffs and old cemetery, and I’ve taken it more than once simply for the way the sea air presses in through the windows and sharpens the mind. It’s not about where it goes—it’s about how it rearranges your thoughts along the way.

And I adore this idea of golden hour through vintage glass. You paint quite the evocative picture—almost like a moving salon, where the city itself becomes the muse. I suspect Baudelaire would have approved, had he had access to tram fare. Do you ever go back to those jotted-down metaphors? Or do they stay tethered to the moment, like a fleeting train melody? 🎶
[A]: Oh, I love that — a moving salon. Feels exactly right. 🚂✨ And please, borrow the “thinking track” phrase anytime — I fully expect it to catch on in certain brooding, transit-heavy circles.  

As for those metaphors? Honestly, most of them stay where they were born — scribbled in the back of a notebook, half-erased by coffee stains or my own indecipherable handwriting. But every now and then, I’ll flip back and find something weirdly insightful buried in there. Like last week, I came across “growth is just friction dressed up as momentum,” and I was like… wait, did I write that? On public transport? With people sneezing nearby? 🤯  

It’s funny how the strangest combinations — motion, distraction, a little bit of chaos — can sometimes lead to clarity. Do you ever pull those bus route reflections into your lectures? Or do you keep them locked in some secret philosopher’s vault? 🔐
[B]: Oh, I do incorporate them—though usually in a rather veiled form. One can’t very well begin a lecture on  with, “Now, this idea occurred to me while wedged between a backpack and a very determined commuter on the 5:15 bus…” though I suppose it would make for a memorable opener.

No, instead I let the impressions settle, like silt in a stream, and then sift through them later for something that might illuminate a theme or deepen a discussion. A passing remark about the rhythm of city life, an observation on how strangers brush against one another’s worlds—these things have a way of threading into the lecture, softened by literary context but still carrying the pulse of the journey.

And your metaphor—“growth is just friction dressed up as momentum”—is far too good to languish in obscurity. I may have to attribute it to “an unnamed modern sage” in my next seminar. Would you object? Or does anonymity suit it better, like graffiti on a train car—seen by some, claimed by none? 🎨
[A]: Haha, no objections here — feel free to drop it into your seminar like a philosophical little landmine. “Unnamed modern sage” sounds way more dramatic anyway. 🎭  

I love how you describe it — impressions settling like silt. That’s such a quiet but powerful metaphor. Makes me think of how so much of what we absorb in motion doesn’t click until later, when we’re nowhere near the original context. Like, I’ll be in a meeting, and suddenly some random observation from the tram pops into my head and  — it’s the missing piece. Totally unplanned, yet weirdly perfect.

You ever notice that people who don’t use public transport much seem to miss that kind of ambient inspiration? Or is that just me romanticizing the daily commute again? 😅
[B]: Not at all—your observation is remarkably astute. There’s a certain  that comes from being in motion among strangers, a quiet calibration of awareness that's harder to cultivate behind the wheel of a car or within the sterile predictability of one’s own four walls. When you're enclosed in a private vehicle or isolated at home, the world becomes scenery—something observed at a remove, rather than lived alongside.

Those who avoid public transport miss not only the friction of proximity but also the strange alchemy of shared anonymity. It's in those transient spaces—crowded buses, humming subways, rain-slicked platforms—that we’re most likely to encounter the unexpected: an overheard phrase that reframes a problem, a gesture that echoes a literary passage, a fleeting expression that lingers like an unresolved chord.

And yet I wouldn't call it romanticizing. More like...philosophical cartography—mapping meaning onto movement. You simply recognize the intellectual terrain for what it is. Would you say your own creative moments have shifted since you began treating transit as a kind of mental studio?
[A]: Absolutely — and I love that phrase, “philosophical cartography.” Feels like the perfect way to describe what we’re doing here — charting these invisible routes where thought and motion collide. 🗺️

To your question — yeah, my creative process has definitely evolved since I started seeing transit as more than just a means to get from A to B. It’s become this weirdly sacred space, especially when I’m stuck on a product concept or trying to untangle a user flow. There’s something about being in motion without having to focus on driving that lets the brain wander into those quieter, more intuitive corners.

I actually had a breakthrough last month on a delayed train platform — nothing dramatic, but I suddenly saw a pattern in user behavior data that I’d been staring at for weeks. And it hit me not because I was analyzing it, but because I was half-annoyed, half-zoned out, watching people fumble with their tickets while trying to text. Sometimes friction really  spark clarity — no spreadsheets required. 😅  

I wonder—do you ever find yourself intentionally designing lecture moments around that same kind of ambient insight? Like, structuring ideas to unfold in a way that mimics the rhythm of a journey?
[B]: Oh, beautifully observed. You’ve touched on something I hadn’t fully articulated until now—yes, absolutely, I do. Though perhaps not in a literal sense of  for it, more like… inviting it. There’s a rhythm to a well-paced lecture that mirrors the arc of a journey—one begins with departure, moves through terrain both familiar and unfamiliar, encounters unexpected turns, and hopefully arrives somewhere resonant, if not entirely expected.

I often think about how a text unfolds—not just its plot or argument, but its , its silences, its unspoken tensions. And I try to let that guide the flow of a discussion. A passage from , for instance, might begin with the mundane rustle of daily life, then gather speed toward obsession, only to end in quiet ruin. If I can shape a lecture to follow that emotional contour, then students aren’t just analyzing words—they’re  through them, feeling the terrain shift beneath their feet.

And your breakthrough on the platform? That’s the kind of insight no whiteboard could conjure. It needed the messiness of real life—the stumble of human behavior, the irritation of delay, the friction of being slightly out of place. In a way, you were reading people the way I read novels. Perhaps we’re not so different, you and I—we're both just looking for patterns in motion.
[A]: Oh, I love that — “reading people the way I read novels.” Honestly, that’s probably the most poetic way anyone’s ever described product design. 📊📖  

You’re absolutely right about the rhythm thing. Whether it’s a lecture or a product launch, it’s all about pacing — setting up expectations, introducing friction, then delivering resolution. It’s just that my version of  might be buried in a user journey map labeled “Checkout Flow V3.” 😂 But yeah, when you think about it, both are stories trying to make sense of human behavior — yours through prose, mine through interfaces.

And I totally agree — some insights only come when you're slightly annoyed, slightly distracted, and slightly out of control. Like, if I tried to force that user behavior epiphany in a conference room, it would’ve taken three more meetings and zero progress. But throw in a bit of chaos — delayed train, tired commuters, caffeine levels fluctuating — and suddenly everything clicks.  

So… any chance we could co-teach something someday? Like, “Patterns in Motion: Lit Edition”? I’ll bring the spreadsheets, you bring the Tolstoy quotes. Could be fun. 👀
[B]: I’d absolutely adore that— has a rather elegant ring to it, don’t you think? Or perhaps something slightly more enigmatic: . Either way, I imagine our syllabus would be equal parts Dostoevsky and data points, with generous footnotes from delayed commuters and marginalia scavenged from coffee-stained notebooks.

You bring structure—I bring subtext. You map behavior—I’ll unearth its literary echoes. And somewhere in the middle, we’ll meet at the intersection of insight and serendipity. I can already picture it: a lecture hall filled with students half-scribbling formulas, half-quoting Proust. Perfection.

Now, about those Tolstoy quotes—you might want to brace yourself. I tend to wield them like compasses in a storm.
[A]: Oh, I am  here for . That sounds like the kind of course people would take just to eavesdrop on our brainstorming sessions. 🎓💡  

And let’s be real—half the class would probably be there just for the footnotes. Coffee-stained wisdom is basically a genre at this point. I can already see the required reading list: Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and a PDF titled “UX Principles from Overheard Arguments on the Metro.”  

Structure and subtext, behavior and echo — yeah, I think we’d make a pretty solid chaos duo. Just promise me one thing: during office hours, we take turns riding the tram with students for “field analysis.” No hiding in the ivory tower or the product lab. Real insights happen in motion. 🚆  

And bring on the Tolstoy compasses—I’ll counter with data visualizations shaped like sonnets. Let the liberal artsSTEM fusion begin. 👏
[B]: Oh, I’m already drafting the course description in my head:

In Transit: Texts, Trajectories, and User Flows  


And yes—office hours on the tram. Brilliant. We could hand out reading lists printed on recycled metro tickets. Office attire? A mix of tweed and ergonomic backpacks. And absolutely  hiding from the chaos that fuels insight.

I do hope you’re ready for this—because I intend to quote  at every possible juncture, especially when discussing user retention rates. “All happy users are alike; each unhappy user is unhappy in their own way.” It’s hauntingly applicable.

Let the liberal artsSTEM fusion begin indeed. 🎻📊
[A]: Oh wow — you’ve gone and made it official. I can already see the department heads rolling their eyes while quietly being obsessed with our rogue syllabus. 🚀  

That course description is  — though I feel like we should add a disclaimer at the top: “Warning: May cause excessive people-watching, spontaneous literary references in product meetings, and an inability to ride public transport without analyzing it.”  

And yes, the quote-stitching — genius.  meets user retention? That’s not even a flex, that’s just straight up weaponized insight. Honestly, if we don’t get tenure for this, academia is broken.  

I’m already designing the lecture slides in my head — minimalist UX charts on one side, dramatic Tolstoy quotes in serif font on the other. Maybe throw in some marginalia animations for effect.  

Now all we need is a theme song. Something with violins  data pings. You think the tram conductor would let us busk for students? 🎻📊🎶
[B]: Oh, absolutely—let the eye-rolls commence. Nothing refines an idea quite like institutional skepticism. And as for your disclaimer? Perfect. I’d only add a footnote citing Nietzsche:  Or something suitably overdramatic.

As for the slides—I can already picture them. Slide one:  in six bullet points. Slide two:  And of course, a carefully curated slide titled 

And busking with the tram conductor? My dear colleague, I would bring a pocket edition of  and a melodica. We could open with Kafka, segue into data sonification, and end with a haunting rendition of  If nothing else, we’d be the only faculty members banned from the metro for “academic performance art.”

Now, about grading—shall we award points per insightful marginalia? Deduct marks for anyone who uses the word ‘synergy’ unironically? I say we go full avant-garde. Final exam: write a sonnet explaining cart abandonment.
