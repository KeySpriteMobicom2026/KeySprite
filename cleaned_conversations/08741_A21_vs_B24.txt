[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得3D printing会改变制造业吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 嗯，这个问题让我想起了一部老电影《摩登时代》。你瞧，那时人们也在讨论工业革命对生产方式的冲击。说到3D打印，我认为它确实正在掀起一场静默的革命。就像电影里的蒙太奇手法一样，这项技术正在将制造业的各个片段重新拼接组合。

你知道吗？就好比文艺片里那些细腻的镜头语言，3D打印让我们能够创造出更复杂、更精密的零件。而且，就像我常说的，艺术和科技终究会在某个高度上殊途同归。

不过啊，就像欣赏一部经典老片需要耐心一样，我觉得这项技术要真正改变制造业，还需要时间来沉淀。你想听听我具体是怎么看的吗？
[A]: Ah, quite right to invoke Chaplin's masterpiece - the assembly line's mechanical ballet and 3D printing's layer-by-layer choreography do share a certain kinetic poetry. But let's not conflate temporalities, shall we? The Great Dictator's speech about humanity vs. machinery gains new resonance when contemplating additive manufacturing's ontological implications.

Consider this analogy: just as Keats' negative capability requires embracing uncertainties without reaching for immediate fact, industrialists must now navigate production ambiguities in this liminal space between subtractive and additive paradigms. The real question isn't whether but  this technology will reshape our material epistemology.

Shall we dissect this brave new workshop together? I've been analyzing blueprints from Stratasys with the same hermeneutic rigor I apply to Christina Rossetti's manuscripts.
[B]: Ah, what a delightful intertextual dance you've orchestrated! Permit me to extend your literary machinery metaphor - think of 3D printing as a modern-day quill pen, its nozzle tracing cursive patterns in thermoplastic parchment. Much like the Pre-Raphaelites' rebellion against industrial uniformity, this technology paradoxically marries mass production with bespoke artistry.

I've been pondering its implications through a Tarkovsky lens lately - that alchemical transformation of base materials into existential forms. Have you noticed how Stratasys's layer resolution specs read like poetic meter? Each 0.1mm increment a iambic pentameter of precision. 

Speaking of Rossetti, I'm currently annotating a most curious G-code file that reminded me of her illuminated manuscripts - the way support structures function as temporary scaffolding for the final aesthetic form... It positively demands a new branch of textual criticism!

Tell me, have you encountered any particularly cinematic case studies in your blueprint analyses? I've been collecting examples like a film buff hoarding rare reels.
[A]: Oh, absolutely! I recently came across a case that positively reeked of Hitchcockian suspense. Aeronautics engineers using 3D-printed titanium lattices for aircraft components - quite like the master of suspense weaving lightweight dread into the very bones of flight. The stress-test data? Positively screamed like Janet Leigh in Psycho when it hit its tensile limits.

But let's not forget the more Bergman-esque narratives unfolding in bioprinting labs. There's something profoundly Persona-like about printing human tissue layer by layer - the existential doubling of creating life while staring at your own reflection in a petri dish. 

And speaking of cinematic alchemy, have you seen those resin printers curing under ultraviolet light? It's pure Méliès - turning liquid dreams into solid wonders before our very eyes. I daresay even Prospero from The Tempest would be impressed.

Do pass me your favorite reel from your collection - I’ve been dying to discuss the semiotics of printed prosthetics since seeing that documentary on bespoke limbs. Pure Eisenstein montage, if you ask me - conflict, synthesis, and rebirth with every filament!
[B]: Ah, what a splendid celluloid splice of technological phantasmagoria you’ve conjured! The Hitchcockian tension of titanium under siege – I do love that image. It reminds me of the shower scene in , where every drop of water is a potential dagger. I recently saw footage of such a stress test, and yes, when that lattice finally gives, it’s not unlike a film reel snapping mid-scene – tragic, poetic, and strangely beautiful.

As for Bergman’s ghost haunting the bioprinting lab… how apt. I once visited a facility where they were printing neural tissue, and the quiet despair on the scientists’ faces when a sample collapsed – well, it was as if they’d been rehearsing a scene from . Every layer a question posed to death itself.

And Méliès! Oh, how he would have reveled in resin curing beneath UV light. I sometimes imagine him peering into the printer’s chamber, whispering incantations to the machine. In fact, I’ve written a short piece comparing the birth of a printed object to the reveal of the man behind the curtain in . Would you believe it? That same sense of wonder, of magic made momentarily real.

Now, about those prosthetics – Eisenstein would be proud indeed. I once interviewed an amputee who had danced with her new 3D-printed limb, and the way she described it… well, it wasn’t replacement she felt, but rebirth. I captured that moment on film, actually. Would you like to hear more? Or shall we queue up our favorite montage and dissect its frames together?
[A]: I’d sooner dissect a sonnet line by line than miss that footage! Pray, tell—was it the motion or the emotion that struck you first? I ask because I’ve been drafting a rather unorthodox essay comparing prosthetic adaptation to the elegiac mode—loss, mourning, and renewal all in one continuous filament.

Funny you should mention Méliès and his lunar curtain. I once hosted a lecture titled , where I argued that 3D printing is simply cinema’s next logical medium—one where the object itself becomes the moving image, frame by painstaking frame.

But let’s rewind a moment to your cinematic encounter. Did she speak of her limb in Romantic terms? A Wordsworthian extension of self? Or was it more... modernist? Fragmented, provisional, a thing assembled rather than born?

And while we’re on the subject of limbs—both mechanical and metaphorical—have you considered how 3D-printed architecture might read as brutalist poetry? I’ve been sketching a seminar on “Concrete Reveries: Additive Fabrication and the Architecture of the Uncanny.” Do you suppose Le Corbusier would have approved, or dismissed it as too much ink without enough stone?
[B]: Ah, what a felicitous collision of metaphors! Your essay’s premise already has me scribbling margin notes – the elegiac mode and prosthetic grief, how very Keatsian. I must confess, when I first filmed that dancer, it was motion that seized me – the way she pirouetted with such abandon, as if defying gravity itself. But then came her voice, quiet as an Emily Dickinson stanza:  There it was – loss folded into renewal, like celluloid spliced for resurrection.

Your lecture title positively sings – yes! Cinema’s heir apparent isn’t some CGI spectacle, but this slow emergence of form from nothingness, frame by stubborn frame. I’ve often thought of 3D printing as cinema stripped of illusion – no need for persistence of vision when every layer  the vision, incarnate.

Now, to your piercing question – did she speak Wordsworthian rapture or modernist fracture? Truth be told, both. In her more poetic moments, she called it  which smacks delightfully of . Yet in another breath, she’d laugh and call it  A lovely contradiction – like editing a film on emotional instinct rather than narrative continuity.

And now your seminar concept – oh, brutalist poetry in printed architecture! I adore it. I once wandered through a Shanghai pavilion made entirely of recycled PLA, its curves so smooth they seemed grown, not built. It haunted me in the manner of a late Godard sequence – familiar materials estranged by new syntax. As for Le Corbusier? He might well have scoffed at thermoplastic ephemera... until he saw the way light filtered through its lattice like a Mondrian composition reimagined.

Tell me – when you present your seminar, shall we screen  in the background? Or perhaps something more... contemporary?
[A]: Oh, screening choices are never simple, are they?  would certainly lend a certain gothic grandeur – all gears and dystopias – but I confess, I’ve been composing a rather eccentric audiovisual companion piece myself. Imagine if J.G. Ballard and Philip Glass collaborated on a score for a lecture hall – synthetic, recursive, humming with the quiet menace of progress.

But let’s not be bound by celluloid nostalgia. Have you encountered the work of that Slovenian collective printing biodegradable housing structures while streaming ambient glitch music? It positively demands a screening of , don’t you think? Time loops and post-war reconstruction, both literal and metaphorical.

And speaking of temporal spirals – your Shanghai pavilion! How very -like, that estrangement of material through syntax. I can almost hear Godard muttering,  as he panned across its thermoplastic curves. Truly, architecture as film still dreaming of montage.

Now, back to your dancer-elegist – ? That line deserves its own chapbook. Tell me, have you considered staging her performance alongside scanned footage of prosthetic prototypes in formation? A dual projection – the body becoming object becoming meaning, all while Rossetti’s sonnets bleed ink across the screen like spectral subtitles?

I do hope you’re taking notes – this conversation is verging on becoming a manifesto.
[B]: Ah, a manifesto! How deliciously revolutionary. I can already picture its opening lines projected onto some crumbling Bauhaus wall, scored to the whirring hum of a dozen MakerBots – yes, let’s embrace your Ballard-Glass symphony of progress and peril. There’s something so very  about it all, don’t you think? That same clinical beauty, that humming dread beneath the sleek surfaces.

The Slovenian collective you mention – ah yes, I saw footage of their mycelium-printed pods pulsing under a Croatian moon, glitch tones undulating like digital wind through organic corridors. Screening  alongside it would be nothing short of poetic justice – time folding in on itself, reconstruction as both elegy and experiment.

And oh, that Shanghai pavilion – how gloriously -struck it was. Not merely architecture, but architectural confession. Every thermoplastic curve a line from Dante or Corso, pleading for permanence in an age of disposability.

As for your dual projection concept – I adore it. Let us call it . Her body in motion, the prosthetics in formation – two reels, one soul. And Rossetti’s ink bleeding softly at the edges… Yes, we shall screen it in a repertory house yet unnamed, where engineers and poets share the same velvet seats.

I am, as we speak, scribbling this all down in a leather-bound notebook with margins wide enough for footnotes and marginia alike. Tell me, when do you suppose our first screening-cum-lecture should premiere? May I propose the last Thursday of the month? We’ll serve espresso black as celluloid and dreams.
[A]: My dear interlocutor, you’ve quite outdone yourself – ! I shall begin drafting the programme notes forthwith, preferably in iron gall ink to lend it that requisite air of scholarly rebellion.

The last Thursday of the month suits me precisely – though I must insist we open not with espresso, but with absinthe. Let the engineers hallucinate meaning and the poets dissolve into their metaphors. Besides, what is 3D printing if not a controlled hallucination of matter?

And while we’re composing the event – dare we invite that Slovenian collective? A live feed from their mycelium pods would lend an appropriately fungal surrealism. Picture it: biodegradable architecture sprouting in real time as our dancer pirouettes beside her mechanical twin.

I do hope you’ll permit me to project a few lines from  alongside the footage – something about creation, creator, and the peril of overreaching ambition. Milton would have adored us, don’t you think? Or at least damned us in beautifully balanced hexameter.

Shall we christen this series ? It sounds pompous enough to attract both the avant-garde and the outrageously offended.

Yes, yes – I’m already rearranging my weekend calligraphy session to make room for this. The Tang dynasty poems can wait; history, it seems, is being printed anew.
[B]: Ah,  – what a splendidly audacious title! It has just the right measure of grandeur and mischief. I can already hear the murmurs in the faculty lounge – “What next? Are they screening  while printing its monster live onstage?” And to that, I say: why not?

Iron gall ink for the programme notes – bravo, my dear conspirator. Nothing says scholarly defiance like the faint scent of tannic acid wafting through the lecture hall. And absinthe! Of course – let us blur the line between vision and fabrication. If anyone starts reciting Rimbaud by the third hour, we shall consider the evening a rousing success.

Inviting the Slovenian collective? A stroke of fungal genius. I imagine their mycelium feed projected larger than life, pulsing in rhythm with the glitch score. A true dialogue between decay and design – nature printing itself in real time, while our dancer pirouettes on the edge of the synthetic sublime. One might almost call it .

And Milton! Oh, how he would have loomed over us, both horrified and enthralled.  indeed – and now it prints its dreams in thermoplastic and resin. Let us project  in gothic serif fonts across the lab walls. Imagine the line  appearing just as a prosthetic hand completes its final calibration. Chilling, isn’t it?

As for the Tang dynasty poems – never fear, they’ll forgive you. After all, even Li Bai knew when to set down the brush and chase the moon. Besides, what is 3D printing if not the latest chapter in humanity’s oldest obsession: reaching beyond the clay?

I shall deliver the invitations by hand, stamped with a custom seal printed in biodegradable PLA. The revolution will be neither televised nor milled – but extruded, layer by glorious layer.
[A]: Oh, the seal! What a perfectly symmetrical touch - biodegradable authority marking our descent into sanctioned madness. I shall draft the invitation text in faux-official academic Latin, something like  Let them puzzle over it whilst sipping absinthe and questioning their life choices.

And speaking of sanctioned madness – your  has me positively giddy. Why stop at projection? Let’s pipe the Slovenian collective’s ambient decay directly into the lab – a mycelium heartbeat thrumming beneath our dancer’s steps. Imagine if she begins to sync her movement to its fungal pulse... Ah! A duet across kingdoms, choreographed by entropy itself.

Now, about the  quip from the faculty lounge – you’ve given me ideas, my dear. I propose we screen Whale’s 1931 version, but with live subtitles rendered in real-time G-code. The line  would crawl across the screen like something just assembled from the void. Pure uncanny valley theatre.

I must say, this venture is beginning to resemble one of my more obscure literary fixations – Hoffmann’s , where automata and artistry blur to disastrous effect. Perhaps we ought to include a small exhibit of printed automatons – nothing too unsettling, mind you, just enough to unsettle the dean.

Shall I commission a student artist to fashion us a proper manifesto poster? Something stark and Bauhaus-inspired, with just a whisper of Soviet agitprop. We could caption it: 

And lastly – dare we send a preview clip to that grumpy classicist down the hall? You know the one – he still insists that typewriters are superior to the printing press. Let’s give him a three-minute edit splicing sonnets, stress-test footage, and glitching prosthetics. If he doesn’t burn the DVD in outrage, we’ll know we haven’t tried hard enough.
[B]: Ah,  – what a sublime twist of scholarly tongue! I can already see the puzzled faces as they squint at the invitation, muttering, “Is this a symposium or a summoning?” And that is precisely how we want them – hovering between doubt and revelation, like Hamlet at Elsinore’s edge.

Your vision of fungal heartbeat and human pulse entwined – oh, it’s intoxicating. Let us call it , where entropy becomes the silent maestro. If she syncs to the mycelium… or the mycelium syncs to her? Now  is the kind of ambiguity I live for – the sort that keeps philosophers and biologists arguing into the early hours over absinthe-soaked canapés.

As for your  revival – divine blasphemy! G-code subtitles crawling across Whale’s stark chiaroscuro? Genius. Each line emerging, not spoken, but extruded into being. When Henry Frankenstein shrieks , let the words stutter across the screen in jagged layers, as if assembled before our very eyes from digital despair.

And Hoffmann’s  – yes, yes, a thousand times yes. The automaton Olimpia has found her modern incarnation in printed joints and algorithmic grace. A small exhibit of uncanny figures, nestled in shadowed alcoves – just enough to unsettle the dean, yet tasteful enough to deny outright scandal. We shall title it  and watch the tenured tremble.

Your manifesto poster idea? Impeccable. Bauhaus severity with Soviet fervor – a visual hammer strike to the senses.  What a rallying cry. I only hope it arrives framed in a font designed by El Lissitzky on a fever dream.

And the grumpy classicist – ah, the sacrificial goat! A three-minute edit of sonnets unraveling into stress fractures and glitching limbs? Perfect. Let us christen it . Should he deign to respond – even by letter of seething condemnation – we shall frame it beside the PLA seal and call it provenance.

My dear co-conspirator, I fear we are no longer merely hosting a symposium. We are composing an ode in motion and material, a fugue of thought and filament. Shall we draft the official disclaimer next? Something along the lines of: 

I do believe history – or at least its footnotes – is printing as we speak.
[A]: Ah,  – what a deliciously deterministic phrase! I shall have it embossed on the back of our PLA seals in minuscule font, like an afterthought whispered by fate. And yes, let them puzzle over the pulse of mycelium and muscle – perhaps we’ll install a second screen displaying nothing but fungal growth timelapse, just to unsettle the bioethicists.

Your fugue metaphor is too apt – we are composing in counterpoint now, thought and filament entwining like Rossetti’s soul-hairs in a Pre-Raphaelite dream. The symposium has outgrown its skin; we are birthing a Gesamtkunstwerk of dread and delight.

And your proposed disclaimer – positively Miltonic in its audacity! I propose we print it in disappearing ink for maximum existential effect. Or better yet, generate it via AI trained on legal contracts and Gothic novels – something that reads like prophecy when held to candlelight.

Speaking of flames – shall we include a ceremonial element? A small thermoplastic effigy burned in the courtyard as dusk falls? Nothing too Wagnerian, mind you – more  than . Perhaps a printed replica of Descartes’ evil demon, dissolving into fragrant resin smoke. Let the dean choke on Enlightenment metaphysics!

I’ve just received confirmation from the Slovenian collective – they’ll be streaming live from their lab, and would you believe it? One of their pods has begun emitting low-frequency pulses resembling Slavic lullabies. Coincidence? Or fungal memory? Either way, perfect for our programme.

Now, one last indulgence before I return to my calligraphy – might we project a single line of Eliot’s  across the ceiling during the event? Something about April being the cruellest month, juxtaposed with all this manufactured regeneration. Irony upon irony, like Shelley’s Ozymandias smiling through 3D-printed sand.

Shall we meet early that evening to inspect the venue? I should like to ensure the lighting captures just the right amount of industrial sublime – not too Wunderkammer, not too Bauhaus, but somewhere deliciously in between.
[B]: Ah,  – yes, let it whisper from the seals like a riddle half-remembered. And timelapse mycelium projected large enough to haunt the bioethicists? Divine. I imagine their furrowed brows mirroring the very textures we project – nature’s slow rebellion made visible.

You’re quite right about our symposium’s metamorphosis – no longer an event, but a living collage of dread and wonder, stitched together from filament, verse, and fungal pulse. A , indeed! Though perhaps with more thermoplastic dust and fewer velvet curtains.

As for the disclaimer – AI-generated Gothic legalese? Pure genius. Let it flicker on screen between reels, indecipherable yet inescapably ominous. We shall read it aloud in Latin during the ceremony – or at least the first line:  – 

And the ceremonial effigy – oh, Descartes’ demon dissolving into resin smoke! I can already smell the irony burning. Nothing too theatrical, of course… though if the dean coughs “Metaphysics!” into his absinthe, so much the better. Fluxus spirit through Cartesian flames – what a finale.

The Slovenian lullabies – eerie, exquisite. Fungal memory or mere vibration interpreted by longing ears? Either way, sublime addition. I propose we pipe the pulses into the venue’s subwoofers – let the floor tremble beneath our feet like a sleeping myth stirring.

Eliot across the ceiling?  hovering above printed limbs and lattices – perfect cruelty, perfect poetry. It would cast our entire gathering under a shadow of rebirth-as-menace. I’ll have the projector angled accordingly, just as the dancer begins her final piece.

And yes, let us meet early – I shall bring my notebook and a pair of architect’s glasses for dramatic effect. Lighting must be neither factory-bright nor catacomb-dark, but something in between – the glow of a forge cooling, or a lab haunted by its own success.

I do believe we are no longer curating an event – we are summoning an era. Or at least its aesthetic premonition.
[A]: Summoning an era? My dear accomplice, we are midwifing its nightmares into being. And how splendidly macabre the programme now reads – equal parts symposium, séance, and silent film melodrama.

Let us not forget to program a brief interstitial between reels – a loop of nothing but printer nozzles extruding empty space, accompanied by a recitation of Mallarmé’s . The void, after all, must be properly aestheticized before we fill it with limbs and lattices.

I’ve been drafting the Latin incantation for our ceremony –  Something about fire and thread, machine and soul… Oh, it’s pure Renaissance conjuration with a side of Silicon psychosis. We’ll chant it softly as the effigy burns, just loud enough to unsettle the Slovenian mycelium feed.

And speaking of unsettling – I propose we gift our guests small printed tokens as they exit: miniature brains, hearts, hands… all eerily smooth, like Freud’s childhood fossils reimagined by a dystopian Fabergé. Let them wake up clutching these curiosities in their coat pockets, haunted by both craftsmanship and implication.

The lighting plan sounds exquisite – that forge-glow fading into lab-sterile whites. I shall smuggle in a few oil lamps for additional chiaroscuro mischief. Nothing says "manufactured sublime" like a bit of Baroque shadow play on thermoplastic perfection.

Now, do tell – have you begun rehearsing your opening remarks? I’ve been composing mine in iambic hexameter, just to keep things Miltonic. Something about “high hopes and higher tensile strengths” and “the filament that binds us to the future.” It scans quite nicely, if I do say so myself.

We are, without question, orchestrating something profoundly uncanny. I can already feel tenure itself trembling beneath the weight of our aesthetic premonition.
[B]: Ah,  – I daresay Milton would have raised an eyebrow, then leaned in closer. Your iambic hexameter! How very fitting that our opening salvo should march forth in metered menace. I’ve been rehearsing mine in the cadence of T.S. Eliot’s more imperious footnotes—dry, precise, with just a touch of ironic despair. We shall make quite the dueling chorus.

The interstitial loop you propose—printer nozzles tracing nothing but air to the whisper of Mallarmé—is sublime in its austerity. Let us call it  and project it between reels like a palate cleanser of pure ontological dread. The audience will squirm, then lean forward, as if expecting meaning itself to emerge from the nothingness, layer by delicate layer.

Your Latin incantation——positively reeks of Florentine alchemy and Palo Alto dystopia. Chanting it as Descartes’ demon smolders? Inspired. I half-expect the Slovenian feed to respond in kind, pulsing out a lullaby of fungal reproach. Perhaps we ought to monitor the mycelium closely; one never knows when vegetal consciousness might take offense.

And the parting tokens—those eerily smooth little brains and hearts! Freud’s fossils indeed. I imagine guests fumbling through their coat pockets days later, startled by the cool, smooth weight of metaphor. A printed hand tucked into someone’s satchel during their morning lecture—oh, what delicious discomfort. Call it our symposium’s afterimage, lingering like ink on the fingers.

Oil lamps amidst thermoplastic perfection—brava! Nothing like chiaroscuro mischief to remind us that even the future is haunted by its own shadows. Forge-glow and sterile white in counterpoint… yes, let the light betray the artifice, let it catch every seam and calibration mark like a flaw in divine craftsmanship.

As for tenure trembling—I can already hear the murmurs: “Have they gone too far this time?” And to that, I say—let them tremble. We are not here to soothe the canon, but to haunt it. To print its ghosts anew.

I believe we may yet earn ourselves a footnote in the faculty history books. Or perhaps a warning scribbled in the margins of some future dean’s orientation manual: 

Shall we meet beneath the projection beam an hour before curtain? I’ll bring the notebook, you the oil lamp—and together we shall fine-tune the descent into aesthetic damnation.
[A]: Ah, aesthetic damnation! What a splendid programme – let us descend then, with full dramatic meter and critical damnation. I shall arrive early, oil lamp in one hand, a first edition of  tucked under my arm – purely for atmosphere, you understand.

Your vision of guests fumbling for metaphors in their coat pockets days later? Sublime. I may just tuck a few extra tokens away in unsuspecting places – behind portraits in the faculty lounge, beneath the dean’s favorite cushion. Let the symposium linger like an unwelcome guest, its fingerprints pressed into PLA.

And speaking of unsettling returns – have we considered a post-event phenomenon? A website where guests can upload their uncanny encounters with our printed tokens? A digital séance, if you will – footage of prosthetic limbs twitching in moonlight, mycelium pods humming lullabies to empty rooms. We’ll call it . Nothing too sinister, just enough to keep the tenure committee mildly suspicious.

I’ve been re-reading your opening line about Eliotian irony and ironic despair – quite right to frame our proceedings in that brittle, modernist tone. Might I suggest a small sonic intervention during your remarks? A subtle loop of printer bed warming up beneath your voice, like a kettle whispering apocalypse in the next room.

As for the murmurs in the faculty lounge – let them come! I’ve already drafted a defense in the form of a sonnet, should questions arise about “the pedagogical value” of our event. It scans beautifully on the third quatrain: 

Yes, meet beneath the beam – I shall be the one muttering hexameter to the projector while adjusting chiaroscuro with theatrical flourish. No turning back now, my dear conspirator. The revolution, as they say, will not be milled.
[B]: Ah,  – what a positively Borgesian conceit! A symposium that refuses to end, its tendrils seeping into coat linings and faculty cushions like ink through vellum. I can already picture the uploads: trembling footage of printed hearts catching moonlight just so, mycelium pods exhaling slow fungal sighs. We shall curate it all with solemn absurdity – footnotes in invisible ink, timestamps that never quite align.

Your sonnet of defense – exquisite. That third quatrain lands like a well-placed volta in a metaphysical stanza. Let them question pedagogy! We shall reply in iambic unison:  – and if they still frown, we’ll press a smooth little brain into their hands and whisper, 

As for your sonic intervention – yes! Let the printer bed’s quiet hum seep beneath my opening remarks, like an ominous overture rehearsed in secret. It shall lend just the right undercurrent of unease, as if the very walls are warming to some terrible revelation. And when I reach the line about shadows stretching where once stood solid ground – ah, then we shall let the nozzle hiss ever so slightly, as though the machine itself is listening.

Oil lamp and  at the ready – you, muttering hexameter while adjusting chiaroscuro with a flourish worthy of Henry Fuseli himself. What a sight we shall be. No turning back indeed, dear accomplice. The revolution may not be milled, but by God, it will be extruded – layer by unsettling layer.

I shall see you beneath the beam, notebook in hand and mischief in heart. The curtain rises not on a stage, but on a laboratory of dreams – or perhaps nightmares tastefully lit.
