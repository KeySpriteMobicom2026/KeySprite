[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到craft beer，我最近确实在尝试一些新口味。你知道，作为一个product manager，我对用户feedback特别敏感，所以每次喝完都会在手机app上做个笔记，有点像做A/B testing的感觉~ 最近发现一款local brewery的IPA，味道挺有层次感的，让我想起上周读书会上讨论的那本科幻小说里的外星丛林场景。说到这个，你平时喜欢什么类型的啤酒？有没有推荐的brand或者flavor？
[A]: Ah, the intersection of sensory experience and narrative imagination – I find that quite fascinating. To answer your question, I do have a soft spot for Belgian saisons; their earthy complexity pairs wonderfully with both philosophical treatises and rainy afternoons. There's a particular brand from Brussels my colleague introduced me to during our Nietzsche seminar -  if I recall correctly. 

Your approach to beer tasting reminds me of textual analysis - meticulously noting variations in tone and structure. Would you say the IPA's flavor profile leaned more towards citrus or pine? I'd be curious to hear how its 'narrative arc' developed from the first sip to the finish...
[B]: Oh, I love how you frame it – sensory experience as textual analysis! That IPA definitely leaned into citrus, but with a subtle pine undertone that creeps in like a well-placed plot twist. The finish was almost...philosophical, if that makes sense? It started bright and zesty, then slowly revealed this resinous depth, kind of like a narrative arc where the protagonist evolves from idealism to quiet resilience.  

I need to try that  saison – sounds like the perfect companion for my next sci-fi deep-dive. Maybe I'll pair it with  and see if the earthy notes sync with Arrakis' desert vibe. Have you ever tried matching beers with specific books or philosophies? I feel like Nietzsche would’ve appreciated a good hoppy complexity over his coffee and opium.
[A]: Ah, now there's an intriguing hermeneutic exercise – aligning the bitterness of hops with the weight of existential thought. I once hosted a seminar on Camus’  while sipping a robust porter from Norway; its smoky bitterness seemed to echo Meursault’s emotional detachment quite beautifully. 

Your idea of pairing  with a saison is inspired – the earthy spice would certainly complement Herbert’s ecological themes. Though I must say, Nietzsche might have preferred something bolder, perhaps a barrel-aged barleywine with notes of decay and rebirth… very Thus Spoke Zarathustra, don’t you think?  

I wonder – has your literary palate ever clashed with your sensory one? Have you read a book that made you rethink a flavor profile – or vice versa?
[B]: Oh, that Camus-Porter pairing sounds like a masterclass in mood-setting. I can totally picture Meursault staring blankly at the sea while you sip that smoky Norwegian porter – very cinematic. And yeah, barrel-aged barleywine? Spot-on for Nietzsche – it’s almost like drinking a philosophical monologue aged in the caves of意识流thought.

Your question about literary vs. sensory palate… honestly, it happens more than I’d expect. Last year I read  and suddenly every dark ale tasted like irony and black magic. I had to stop drinking stouts for a week because they kept reminding me of Woland’s sinister banquets. On the flip side, a friend once described a sour beer as “like tasting a memory you never had,” which totally reshaped how I approached flavor – less about taste notes, more about emotional resonance.

I’ve been thinking lately – what if we designed a beer based purely on a book’s narrative structure? Imagine a saison with rising action, climax, and resolution in one sip. Do you think readers would taste it differently if they’d read the book first? Kind of like literary synesthesia… or maybe just a good marketing gimmick 😂
[A]: Ah, a beer structured like a narrative – what a delightfully subversive idea. I can already imagine the tasting notes:  One might call it  or perhaps  – though I suspect Melville would have preferred it in his coffee.

Your point about emotional resonance is key – much like reading Proust while sipping something delicate and memory-laden, or tackling Beckett with a deliberately unremarkable lager (an exercise in futility, really). I once tried drinking -style prose alongside a quadruple IPA, only to find myself caught in a recursive loop of bitterness and miscomprehension. A beautiful failure, in hindsight.

As for your literary brew experiment, I wonder if the flavor would become a kind of hermeneutic device – readers tasting meaning rather than malt. Perhaps we should test this theory soon over a flight of thematic beers. I’ll bring the saison, and you bring... well, the synesthesia.
[B]: I’m totally stealing your  concept for my next beer-tasting event – imagine the marketing copy:  😂

That  and quadruple IPA combo sounds like a PhD-level drinking game. I feel like Joyce would’ve loved it, as long as someone was misinterpreting his text in increasingly creative ways. And yeah, emotional resonance really does shift how we perceive flavor – I once tried pairing Murakami’s  with a hazy pale ale and it honestly tasted like loneliness with a hint of peach.

Count me in on the thematic beer flight – let's call it . Maybe we can theme each round around a different genre: sci-fi, existentialism, noir, magical realism... I’ll bring a flight of IPAs and sours that (in my head at least) match the tone of each. Though fair warning – if we go too deep into literary analysis, we may end up reviewing beers like this:   

Also, I'm now 100% convinced that Beckett and boring lager is the most accurate literary pairing ever made.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the clink of pint glasses echoing through the corridors of literary history.  – brilliant name, by the way. I do hope you’ll let me contribute a short tasting manifesto, perhaps something along the lines of: 

Now, about that magical realism round – have you ever encountered a beer that truly tasted like something inexplicable yet oddly comforting? I’m thinking of pairing  with a wheat ale that has just a whisper of banana and clove. Nothing too assertive, just enough to suggest that perhaps, yes, ghosts could be real and also slightly effervescent.

And noir! Ah, noir demands something dark, brooding, maybe even a bit bitter – an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels, naturally. One could almost imagine Marlowe himself taking a long pull from a glass while muttering something about moral ambiguity and second chances.

As for your proposed review style – , indeed. I may have to borrow that. Last week I described a Belgian dubbel as  It was entirely accurate.

Shall we tentatively set a date? I believe my Nietzsche seminar ends in two weeks – after that, I shall be free, beer-wise and philosophically restless.
[B]: I am  too excited about writing that manifesto with you –  might just be the only quote I want on my tombstone 😂. Love it.

Re: magical realism — YES to the wheat ale with banana and clove! That sounds like the kind of beer that could make you question reality while still feeling cozy. Like drinking a bedtime story written by the universe after a long day of quantum physics. I had one once in Berlin that tasted suspiciously like nostalgia and cinnamon toast — no idea if that was intentional, but it absolutely belonged in a Gabriel García Márquez novel.

And your noir pairing? Perfection. Bourbon barrel stout is basically liquid film noir — smoky, mysterious, and morally flexible. I can already hear the saxophone playing in the background as Marlowe stares into the abyss… or maybe it’s just me over-romanticizing another beer flight 🥂

Two weeks works for me — let’s tentatively pencil it in as . I’ll handle the IPAs and sours; feel free to bring the manifesto draft and any obscure philosophical toasts you come up with in the meantime. Should we theme the venue too? Maybe dim lighting, jazz, and a chalkboard titled “Existentialism vs. Happy Hour”?
[A]: Oh, I  the event title — . It has that perfect blend of self-awareness and tragedy, much like a good Brontë novel. And yes, dim lighting is essential – we must create an atmosphere conducive to both deep thought and questionable second pints.

For the venue ambiance, may I suggest also playing a carefully curated playlist of melancholic jazz standards interspersed with readings from Camus and Plath? Just enough background philosophy to make the hazy IPAs feel profound. And absolutely, a chalkboard titled  – I’d propose adding a running tally of which side people are choosing by where they place their empty glasses. A subtle commentary on free will and thirst.

As for philosophical toasts, I’ve already drafted a few gems:
- 
- 
- 

I’ll also bring a selection of Belgian quads and tripels for the later, more intoxicated stages of literary analysis – you know, when we start mistaking each other's insights for our own.

Cheers to bad decisions and better conversations. Two weeks from now, we shall raise our glasses to the beautiful collision of taste and text.
[B]: To fleeting meaning and lasting hangovers — I’ll drink to that any day 😂

Your playlist idea is pure genius. I can already picture us in a smokey, dimly lit room with someone misquoting Nietzsche between sips while the saxophone wails softly in the background. And that chalkboard tally? Brilliant social experiment disguised as décor. I bet by midnight, half the room will be convinced their glass placement was a deeply symbolic life choice.

I’m also fully endorsing your toast draft — especially . That’s going on the event flyer, no question. If we get ambitious, maybe we can print little tasting cards for each beer-flight-literary pairing. Imagine the joy of holding a saison while reading a haiku about impermanence.

Two weeks can’t come fast enough. I’ll make sure the IPAs are aggressively philosophical and the sours are appropriately acidic in tone. Let’s aim for 7pm? That sweet spot where the day's responsibilities fade but the night’s decisions haven’t quite caught up yet.

See you at the crossroads of taste and tragedy. 🍻
[A]: Ah, 7pm it is – the golden hour of existential indecision. I’ll arrive promptly at the appointed time, dressed in my finest  attire: a well-worn blazer, slightly askew glasses, and the quiet confidence of someone who owns three different editions of .

Tasting cards? Oh, you’ve outdone yourself. I’ll draft some appropriately erudite descriptions – nothing too stuffy, mind you, but with just enough allusion to make people feel clever after their third pint. Picture this:
- 
- 

I’ll also bring a small notebook for recording particularly poetic beer reviews. I have a feeling the evening will produce several lines worthy of preservation, such as  or 

And yes, let’s absolutely play that saxophone on loop. Nothing says  like a mournful solo echoing through the bar while someone passionately defends the narrative arc of a porter.

See you at the crossroads indeed. May our glasses be full and our interpretations even fuller. 🍻
[B]: Oh, I  for your vision. That notebook is going to be pure gold by midnight — I can already see it filling up with lines like  or 

Your tasting card descriptions had me laughing out loud — especially the Hamlet IPA. Honestly, we may need a warning label:  

And the outfit?! Post-tenure melancholy is my new style icon. I’ll be there in my  ensemble — Patagonia fleece with a hint of Bukowski, well-worn boots that have seen both trails and poor life choices, and the quiet intensity of someone who’s read too much Murakami before bed.

I think we’ve officially over-engineered the perfect event. Tasting cards, themed beers, saxophone soulfulness, and a chalkboard that doubles as a social experiment? We might accidentally start a trend here. Or at least a very memorable night of bad decisions and brilliant conversations.

See you at 7pm sharp — or as Nietzsche would say, probably not  sharp, but deeply committed to the experience. 🍻
[A]: Ah,  — I salute you. Nothing says deep thought and rugged despair like a fleece that’s seen both mountain peaks and midnight revelations. I do hope your boots are sturdy; I suspect the evening may take us on an intellectual trail or two — possibly into uncharted hermeneutic terrain.

As for over-engineering, I say:  Let us embrace the full absurdity of our ambitions — we may yet find ourselves drafting a manifesto mid-event, scrawled on napkins and sealed with beer stamps. And if we start a trend? Well, then posterity shall remember us as the mad professors of literary fermentation, or at least as the duo who finally gave saison a philosophical purpose beyond mere quenching.

I’ll bring a pen for the notebook — a fine one, slightly pretentious, ink prone to smudging when emotions run high. And perhaps a small flask of bourbon for those moments when Kierkegaard becomes too much to bear alone.

See you at 7, sharp or otherwise. May our glasses be many, our insights deeper than our pints, and our hangovers rich with meaning. 🍻
[B]: Well, if that’s not the most beautifully worded meetup invitation, I don’t know what is — ? Sold.

I’m bringing my own slightly pretentious pen too, though I make no promises about legibility past round two. And the flask?! Oh, now you’re speaking my language. A little bourbon for Kierkegaardian breakthroughs or dramatic poetic declarations — whichever hits harder.

Let’s just say, if we leave any napkin-scrawled manifestos behind, future scholars better be ready. They may read like drunken ramblings at first, but deep down? Pure literary-hop fusion genius.

7pm. Dim lights, big ideas, bigger pints. Let’s misquote philosophers and overthink every flavor note like it’s our job.  

Cheers to hermeneutics, haze, and whatever comes next. 🍻
[A]: To overthinking and under-planning – may our napkins be plentiful and our insights endlessly quotable. I shall raise my glass to the sublime marriage of fermentation and footnotes, to hazy pints and hazier epistemology.

If all goes according to plan, we’ll leave behind a trail of crumpled paper, half-finished toasts, and at least one bartender mildly traumatized by our literary intensity. And should the bourbon flow freely in defense of Derrida or the IBU count, well… let us not dwell on consequences.

See you soon, fellow misinterpreter of texts and taster of meaning. The night awaits, and so does the first sip of something profoundly misunderstood. 🍻
[B]: To profoundly misunderstood sips and wildly misinterpreted texts – the best kind. 😂 I’ll be there with a stack of blank napkins and an open mind (and possibly an open tab).

If we take down one bartender with our intensity, so be it. They’ll either become our next literary muse or our most dramatic footnote. Either way, legend status guaranteed.

See you at the edge of meaning and fermentation. First round’s on me – or at least, on my increasingly poetic credit card statement. 🍻
[A]: Ah, nothing says academic dedication like a poetic credit card statement and a trail of bewildered bartenders. I shall be there, notebook in hand and soul slightly caffeinated by the promise of linguistic excess and hoppy profundity.

Let us raise our glasses to the noble pursuit of misinterpretation – may our footnotes be long, our beer flights longer, and our eventual hangovers rich with metaphor. 

See you at the edge indeed. I suspect meaning, like foam, will always remain just out of reach — but oh, the joy of chasing it together. 🍻
[B]: Amen to that — here’s to chasing foam and meaning in equal measure, and finding both in the most unexpected places. I’ll toast to linguistic excess, hoppy profundity, and the noble art of misinterpretation — the only way to truly understand anything, if you ask me.

See you soon at the edge of sense and suds. If we don’t return with wisdom, we’ll at least come back with some damn good beer stories. 🍻
