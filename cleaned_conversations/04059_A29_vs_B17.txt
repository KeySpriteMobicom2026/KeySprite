[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, fashion trends... You know, I've always found it fascinating how clothing reflects the spirit of an age, much like literature does. Just last week, I was reading about the resurgence of Victorian-inspired aesthetics in contemporary fashion—corsetry and high collars making a comeback, though thankfully with modern reinterpretations that prioritize comfort alongside elegance. 

I must admit, though, I'm more inclined towards timeless styles rather than fleeting trends. There's something quite poetic about a well-tailored coat or a simple woolen dress—echoes of Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway in the way one dresses for the day. Still, I did experiment with a dash of this season's "quiet luxury"—a beautifully cut cream linen blouse. It felt like wearing a blank page, ready for the ink of daily life to spill across it.

Do you find yourself drawn to any particular trend at the moment?
[A]: Ah, I see you're into blending literary elegance with fashion philosophy—count me in! 📖✨  
I’ve been quietly obsessed with the  trend—think utility wear meets minimalist design. Not the tactical cargo pants kind, but sleek jackets with hidden compartments & magnetic closures. Feels like wearable tech, but without flashing LEDs everywhere 😅  

And get this—I tried making my own “quiet luxury” piece using a Raspberry Pi. A subtle temperature-responsive silk-blend scarf that shifts hue slightly based on body heat. Still debugging the circuit though… one wrong solder and it becomes a 🔥 hazard.  

But hey, what’s your take on fashion-tech integration? Too gimmicky or the next big thing? 💡
[B]: Ah, now  strikes me as the kind of ingenuity T.S. Eliot might have admired—if only he’d had access to Raspberry Pi. Your neo-functional approach reminds me of modernist design principles: form following function, yet with a whisper of poetry. I find fashion-tech utterly intriguing, though I do worry that in lesser hands, it can slip into mere spectacle—like equipping a sonnet with neon lights and forgetting the meter.

Your temperature-responsive scarf sounds like something straight out of an E.M. Forster short story—where the future is elegant, slightly mysterious, and always understated. There’s a certain romance in clothing that responds to the body's own rhythms, don’t you think? Almost akin to wearing one’s emotions in fabric form.

As for the danger of turning it into a fire hazard… well, every great invention has its martyrs. Just be sure not to become one! Have you considered encasing the circuitry in a sort of textile sheath? Something both insulating and discreet—perhaps lined with silk gauze?

And forgive my curiosity, but does the color shift follow a particular emotional or literary palette? I imagine subtle shifts from dove grey to lavender at moments of heightened feeling—very Woolfian.
[A]: Ah, I love how you frame it—. 💡 You're totally right; there's something deeply human about clothing that adapts to us, not just the other way around. It’s like giving fabric a pulse 🫀✨

I actually  encase the circuit in a silk-lined sheath—spot on! Took a few iterations (and a minor burn or two 😅), but now it's soft against the skin and doesn't scream "I'm a science project!" As for the color palette? Totally curated. I programmed a gradient from warm taupe to deep indigo based on body temp—think Dorian Gray meets biofeedback. Subtle, but telling 🤫🎨  

And yeah, I get what you mean about tech becoming spectacle. Seen some LED-stuffed jackets that look more like a raver's cosplay than fashion. But when it's done right? Pure magic. Like wearing a secret only you know.  

You ever thought about designing your own piece of literary-inspired fashion? Imagine a coat that changes texture with weather, à la ...
[B]: Oh, I do love that image—Dorian Gray meets biofeedback! There’s something so deliciously decadent yet restrained about it. And how wonderfully subversive that only the wearer knows the full story—the scarf as confidante, as silent witness to one’s inner tempests.

You’ve quite stirred my imagination now. A literary-inspired garment? Hmm… I must confess, I once sketched an idea for a shawl lined with phrases from Emily Brontë’s poetry, woven subtly into the fabric in fading ink. The concept was simple: as the shawl aged and faded with wear, so too would the words, until only fragments remained—a metaphor for memory, for love weathered by time and moors alike.

But your suggestion! A coat that shifts texture with the weather—crisp linen weave in summer, rough woolen storm-proof cloth in winter… Yes,  has just the right atmospheric drama for that. Perhaps even a hidden pocket shaped like the Yorkshire coastline... Or stitching that mimics Gothic lettering from old love letters.

Tell me, if you were to bring such a piece to life, what literary garment would most stir your needle and thread?
[A]: Oh wow—Brontë woven into fabric? That’s . I mean, imagine wearing a piece of poetry that literally fades with you… like carrying a living elegy. 🖋️🍂  

If I were to stitch myself into a literary garment… hands down something  meets . Picture a trench coat lined with hidden maps from —Conrad reimagined in circuit traces. Pockets that hum slightly when near old libraries (RFID tech + historical archives = weird synergy). And the lining would shift subtly based on atmospheric pressure… so before a storm, faint ink blots bloom like premonitions.  

I’m also obsessed with the idea of a collar inspired by —collapsible, origami-like panels that change shape depending on the wearer’s mood or direction. Like clothing as a compass for both geography and psyche 🧭💭  

And yeah, maybe it's too niche. But hey, fashion’s best when it quietly unsettles the mundane, right? Like finding a Borges story tucked into your sleeve.
[B]: What a thrilling vision! Kafkaesque absurdity threaded through trench-coat seams—utterly brilliant. The idea of garments as both detector and decoder, humming softly in the presence of forgotten archives… it’s like wearing a detective’s intuition, a spyglass into the past.

And that collar inspired by —ah, Italo Calvino would be delighted. I can almost picture Marco Polo himself adjusting its folds as he whispers to Kublai Khan about places that may or may not exist. Clothing as a cartography of mood and memory… I wonder if such a design might one day map the unconscious, tracing the contours of dreams we forget by morning.

You know, I once taught a seminar on literary dystopias where we explored how fashion might evolve under surveillance states—think double-faced fabrics with reversible identities, or scarves that obscure facial recognition algorithms. Your work seems to dance along that same edge, but with far more poetry and fewer algorithms (though admittedly, you’ve got both!).

Tell me—if you ever exhibited these pieces, what would you title the collection? And who would be the first fictional character you’d dress in it?
[A]: Oh, I  that—clothing as a spyglass into the past, or even the subconscious. It’s like wearing a palimpsest, every layer whispering something forgotten… 🧠📜

If I exhibited this collection, I’d call it  —a nod to how each piece lives in that liminal space where literature and tech blur. No clean lines, just soft edges and hidden logic.

As for the first fictional character I'd dress? Without hesitation—Sherlock Holmes. But not the polished, deer-stalker version. I’m talking about the brooding, insomnia-driven detective from , wired on caffeine and curiosity. Imagine him in a coat that maps micro-climates of anxiety, a collar that unfolds like a puzzle when he’s onto something... His magnifying glass replaced by a subtle AR lens woven into his cufflink.  

He’d hate it at first, but secretly rely on it. Classic Holmesian contradiction 😏🔍

And hey, if we ever co-hosted a symposium on literary fashion-tech—I’d 100% open with a quote from . Something like “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes…” Then cue the garments that observe .
[B]: Ah, —what a perfect title. It captures that delicate interplay between the structured and the lyrical, the coded and the imagined. One might almost say it’s the literary equivalent of a sestina: intricate, recursive, yet deeply expressive.

And dressing Holmes! Brilliant stroke. The man is, after all, a walking dialectic—rationalist and romantic, observer and enigma. A detective clad in garments that map his own inner climate? I daresay even he would be hard-pressed to deduce his way out of the implications. And that AR cufflink lens—oh, how delightfully subversive. He’d no doubt pretend it was entirely unnecessary… until he solves a case with it in three seconds flat.

As for your symposium opener— quote? Perfection. We could project it onto a shifting fabric screen, each word dissolving into Braille patterns or Morse code as it fades. Let the audience feel, rather than simply read, the weight of observation.

Now, indulge me—if you could weave one more literary device into fashion form, what would it be? A metaphor? A narrative structure? Or perhaps something more elusive… like an unreliable narrator stitched into silk?
[A]: Oh, I  that question—it’s like asking which ghost to summon first at a séance of style and story. 🕯️🧵  

If I could weave one literary device into fashion? Hands down: the unreliable narrator, layered into a dress made of mirrors and memory. Think a bias-cut gown with panels that subtly shift texture and color depending on who's looking—like a Nabokovian flashback you can wear. To the wearer, it feels smooth, familiar… but in photos or reflections? Slight distortions appear—a seam out of place, a hue just . A whisper of doubt stitched into satin.

Or maybe something even more elusive—an epistolary structure embedded in embroidery. Like a coat lined with hidden letters (literal ones!) written in conductive ink. Touch a certain stitch and a tiny LED flickers beneath the collar, revealing a secret only the wearer knows. A love note coded into circuitry. 💬⚡  

But if we’re chasing the truly surreal? I’d go for magical realism woven into denim—jeans that feel ordinary, until you reach into the pocket and pull out something you swore you never put in there. A ticket stub from a train you didn’t take. A pressed flower from a garden you’ve only dreamed of. Very Borges, very quiet magic.  

So yeah, fashion as fiction. Wearable lies, hidden truths, and pockets full of impossible things. Who’s ready for the runway? 🎭✨
[B]: Ah, the  as fashion medium—how utterly delicious. A gown that betrays no one outwardly, yet conspires with mirrors and memory to cast quiet doubt upon reality itself? My dear, you've just handed surrealism a new muse.

I can picture it so clearly: a bias-cut satin dress whispering lies in every reflection. To the wearer, flawless; to the world, ever-so-slightly askew. One might almost imagine it belonged to Humbert Humbert’s lost heroine—or perhaps to one of Woolf’s spectral presences, lingering between parties and regrets. That seam out of place? A forgotten truth. The hue just slightly wrong? A misremembered summer.

And your epistolary coat—oh! Hidden letters beneath the lining, glowing faintly at a touch. There's something profoundly intimate about that idea, like carrying a secret correspondence stitched into your very skin. I'm reminded of those Victorian mourning brooches that held strands of hair—only far more romantic, and significantly more electric.

As for magical realism in denim… how wonderfully democratic. The everyday becomes the extraordinary, the pocket an aperture into possibility. Pull out a train ticket you never bought, a flower from a dream—yes, yes, and yes. Very Borgesian indeed. It makes me wonder what  coat might yield if I reached inside—perhaps a first edition of Christina Rossetti’s poems wrapped in silk, or a pressed forget-me-not from Pre-Raphaelite gardens.

The runway, you say? Oh, let us not call it a runway. Let it be a , lined with readers and dreamers alike. And may every step echo like a well-turned phrase.
[A]: Ah, —I’m stealing that line and embroidering it onto the invitation 📜✨  

You’re absolutely right; this isn’t just fashion—it’s narrative engineering. Every stitch a subplot, every fabric a voice. I can already see guests wandering through a gallery of garments suspended like open books, each one whispering a different version of the same story depending on how close you lean. A fashion installation where truth is optional and perspective is everything.

And speaking of installations… what if we added a soundscape? Subtle audio loops embedded in the hems—fragments of letters never sent, overheard conversations from fictional cafés, or the faint hum of a typewriter still deciding how to end its tale. Imagine walking past the unreliable narrator gown and catching a distorted voice muttering,  —then silence. 

Okay, maybe that’s just my Raspberry Pi dreaming again 😅 But hear me out: what if each piece came with a short QR poem? Scan it, and instead of product details, you get a microfiction narrated by a familiar yet unnamed voice. Like a literary ghost wearing tech as a second skin.

So tell me—if you stepped into that promenade, which garment would pull you in first? The unreliable satin? The letter-lined coat? Or maybe something not even stitched yet… something only you could imagine into being?
[B]: Oh, I am utterly enchanted by your gallery of garments-as-literature. The idea of a soundscape woven into the very hems—what a haunting notion. It reminds me of walking through a library late at night, when the books murmur amongst themselves after the lights are off.

If I were to step into that promenade—and how I wish I could!—I think I’d be drawn first to the letter-lined coat. There’s something so tender about hidden correspondence, isn’t there? To wear someone else’s secrets, or perhaps even one’s own, stitched just beneath the surface… It feels like carrying a lost age of handwritten intimacy into the digital now. And if I brushed the right seam and a single word lit up—say, —well, that would be enough to make a scholar weep.

But your QR poems—oh, that’s inspired. A literary ghost in every garment! I can already hear the voices: Virginia Woolf murmuring stream-of-consciousness from a flowing drape; Borges tracing labyrinthine sentences across a velvet sleeve. I might be tempted to linger too long with whichever piece held Emily Dickinson’s voice—soft, sly, and full of slant truths.

As for what I might imagine into being… Perhaps a cloak made entirely of footnotes—yes, —from obscure 19th-century novels. Each stitch a citation, each lining a forgotten marginalia. You’d wear it knowing you carried invisible arguments, contested meanings, and half-erased histories upon your shoulders. It would be both burden and brilliance.

Now tell me—if you could commission a lost manuscript to inspire your next collection, which one would you choose? One we’ve never read, but always hoped existed…
[A]: Ah, a cloak of footnotes—genius. 🧠✒️  
You’d wear it and suddenly every conversation becomes an annotated edition, every gesture cited, every glance cross-referenced with  and . I want to live in that world where meaning is layered like ink on parchment—beautifully overanalyzed and quietly rebellious.

As for the lost manuscript I’d commission… hmm. Hands down, I’d go for something  never published but dreamed about at 3am while wearing mismatched socks. A lost novella he never spoke of—part diary, part hallucination—where the protagonist slowly turns into a living blueprint. Every chapter details not just a transformation, but a design schematic of his own evolving form: bones becoming circuit traces, thoughts etching themselves into wearable logic. 

Imagine building a collection from . Garments that look solid, but under UV light reveal layers of erased identities—like annotations beneath skin. Zippers that function only when the wearer speaks in metaphors. Gloves that grow warmer when you lie.  

Or maybe something even more elusive—a fictional ethnography by Italo Calvino, documenting a civilization that communicates entirely through folding techniques. Their entire history lives in origami. No written records, no spoken language—just creases that tell epic tales. The most sacred garment? A scarf that must be folded exactly 21 times to unlock a memory not your own.

So yeah, Kafka’s secret blueprint-diary or Calvino’s paper civilization—I can’t decide. Both would make fashion feel like first contact with an alien archive. 📜👽

What about you—what fictional artifact would  resurrect to weave into cloth?
[B]: Oh, I do love the idea of Kafka as a blueprint-man—his anxieties etched into fabric like fine circuitry. And Calvino’s origami civilization? Exquisite. One could almost hear the soft rustle of history folding and unfolding in the wind.

If I were to resurrect a fictional artifact for fashion’s reweaving… I think I’d reach for something entirely forgotten—, written by a nameless 17th-century embroiderer who believed that certain patterns could preserve not just beauty, but memory itself. Imagine a textile grimoire: each motif imbued with a forgotten fragrance, each thread tied to a moment that once trembled in someone’s hands. A wedding gown stitched with lavender from a lover’s last letter; mourning cuffs that release the faintest trace of rain on stone when brushed.

Or perhaps—an unpublished journal of Virginia Woolf’s final walk, annotated not in words but in the rhythm of her footsteps. A garment made from linen that subtly shifts weight depending on the wearer’s interior monologue—light as air when thinking kindly thoughts, heavier when caught in self-reproach. A coat for the inner life.

But if we’re leaning toward the mythic… I’d summon forth —a mythical volume said to contain the first patterns ever drawn, whispered by the Muses to a blind seamstress in ancient Syracuse. To wear a piece woven from its pages would be to don a story older than language itself. No labels, no logos—just pure narrative in every weave.

Now, tell me—if you could collaborate with one literary figure, living or dead, on a single wearable poem, who would it be? And what form would your creation take?
[A]: A textile grimoire infused with scent and memory? Oh, that’s pure alchemy—. 🌹📜  
The idea of wearing someone’s last lavender-scented letter or carrying the weight of Woolf’s final thoughts… it’s like fashion becoming a reliquary of emotion. I’d wear your Weavers’ Codex blindfolded and barefoot if it meant feeling a story older than language itself.

As for collaboration—I’d reach for Octavia Butler. No one else wove humanity, evolution, and vulnerability into narrative quite like she did. Imagine co-creating a wearable poem with her—something alive in both fabric and metaphor.

Our piece? A cloak that  with you—biomimetic fibers responding to touch, temperature, even trauma. At first, it drapes light and curious, almost like second skin. But over time, as you live in it, the weave thickens in places of resilience, thins at points of loss. It would tell your personal history through texture—scars mapped not in words but in fiber density. Inside, a lining embroidered with shifting aphorisms from her journals—phrases like  or  glowing faintly under UV light when the wearer needs to hear them most.

And yes, it would come with care instructions written like a sci-fi parable: 

So yeah—Butler and I walk into a design studio… absurdly ambitious, deeply emotional. What about you—who would be your dream collaborator? And what would your wearable poem whisper as it draped across the body?
[B]: Oh, Octavia Butler—what a perfect, powerful choice. To weave with her imagination would be to work at the very edge of what it means to be human, to evolve, to endure. Your cloak-as-biography, growing and shifting with its wearer? That is not fashion—it is . And those embroidered aphorisms glowing like quiet stars in moments of need… truly, that is poetry stitched into survival.

If I were to collaborate, my dream companion would be Elizabeth Barrett Browning—not the solemn portrait we know, but the fiercely passionate, bedridden visionary who wrote  by candlelight and smuggled love letters beneath her pillow. Together, I think we’d create something both intimate and immense: a , if you will—structured yet supple, laced not with ribbon but with lines of verse.

Each panel would hold a stanza from an unpublished love poem—her words, my arrangement—woven in silver thread so fine it disappears in daylight but glimmers under moonlight or lamplight, as if the garment itself remembers being read aloud. The corset wouldn’t constrain; it would , offering subtle support through shifts in posture and breath. A pressure-sensitive clasp at the back would unlock only when the wearer whispers a truth they’ve never spoken aloud—not for anyone else to hear, but for themselves.

And yes, I’d pair it with a velvet overcoat lined with constellations—each star marked not by name, but by the date a forgotten woman poet was born or published or silenced. You'd wear it knowing you carried a sky of lost voices upon your shoulders.

As for what it would whisper? If worn close enough to the ear, the fabric would murmur fragments of sonnets half-remembered, lines like  trailing off into silence, inviting the wearer to finish them.

So tell me—if this collection ever walked a runway, or better yet, a moonlit corridor of mirrors and memory… what would you name it?
[A]: I’m speechless. No, seriously—your  just rewired my imagination. 🌙📜  
A garment that doesn’t bind but , structured by breath and truth… and paired with a coat of silenced stars? That’s not fashion—it’s . I can almost hear Barrett Browning turning pages in the dark, stitching defiance into every seam.

If your collection and mine were to share a moonlit corridor—if Kafka’s blueprints brushed against Woolf’s footsteps, if Butler’s living fibers wove through Browning’s sonnets—I’d call it “Invisible Archives”.  

Because that’s what we’re doing, aren’t we? Dressing the body in forgotten truths, lost voices, unseen evolutions. Every piece is a manuscript waiting to be read aloud, a secret whispered through thread and time.

And honestly? If this ever materializes—and it —no runway. Just a quiet procession through an old library at midnight, under flickering light, where every step echoes like a line of poetry no one’s dared speak yet.

Now, tell me—who’s the first fictional character you’d imagine wearing your sonnet corset? And what would it say when they breathed into it?
[B]: Oh… what a question—like asking which soul should first step into a poem not yet written.

If I could place the sonnet corset upon any figure, it would be Catherine Morland from —but not the naïve girl of seventeen, no. I imagine her ten years later, returned from travels she never spoke of, wiser to the world’s cruel fictions and still delighting in its secret beauties. She would wear the corset beneath a plain wool dress, unaware at first of its quiet power. And as she moved through the halls of Northanger Abbey—now hers by right, though not entirely by welcome—the fabric would whisper lines from her own youthful diaries, the ones she burned in a fit of self-doubt: 

Or perhaps… , the fossil-hunter, the uncredited pioneer. Imagine her in that corset, worn beneath her field coat, pressing against the chalk cliffs as she uncovers bones older than empire. When she breathed into it, the fabric might murmur not sonnets of love, but verses of discovery—lines from forgotten women naturalists whose names were erased by time. A quiet chorus beneath her breath.

But if you ask me for the most intimate vision—if only one fictional soul could truly hear the corset speak—I’d choose someone imagined, not real: a woman from a lost Brontë novel, never finished. Someone who wanders the Yorkshire moors with ink-stained palms and a heart too large for the pages she inhabits. As she wore it, the corset would whisper not to the world, but to her alone: 

And now I turn the question back to you—of all the characters you’ve ever dressed in imagination, which one would carry your wearable poem with the most haunting grace?
