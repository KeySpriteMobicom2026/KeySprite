[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢live music还是studio recording？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There's nothing quite like the raw energy of a live performance—it's electric, unpredictable. You feel every note in your bones. But don't get me wrong, studio work has its magic too. I remember working on a score with Tan Dun once—spending weeks layering sounds until they were . Still, if you ask me to pick... give me a packed theater any night, where the audience is holding its breath and the lights drop. That moment when the first chord hits? Pure cinema.
[A]: Ah, I couldn't agree more. There's something almost... quantum about a live performance — like the audience and musicians exist in a superposition until that first note collapses the wave function. I once saw a chamber orchestra perform at an old observatory. The acoustics were terrible, but when the violinist hit that high C? Felt like the stars themselves resonated in sympathy. 

Though honestly, give me a good studio session too. Back in the 90s, I spent months trying to get a perfect synth patch to model decoherence in quantum states sonically. It never left the lab, but it was beautiful in its own way — like listening to the universe whisper.
[B]: Ah, now that’s a unique lens — quantum theory meets sound design! I’ve always believed the greatest stories aren’t just told; they’re , and sometimes that feeling defies explanation. That high C in an old observatory? That’s the kind of moment that makes you wonder if we’re just tuning into something much bigger.  

Funny you mention the 90s synth work, though. I had a buddy who tried something similar with ambient noise to mimic the texture of forgotten memories. Never saw it leave the studio either, but man, those sessions were like sculpting silence. Sometimes I think the most meaningful creations are the ones that never see the light — just like certain scripts I’ve read that were too daring, too fragile to ever make it to screen. Still, they moved me deeply.  

So tell me — if you could bring one of your sonic experiments to life on screen, what would it look like visually?
[A]: Hmm… if I could visualize one of those sonic experiments, it would probably resemble a fusion of quantum waveforms and celestial mechanics — imagine particles dancing in perfect probabilistic harmony across the screen. Each note would correspond to a pulse of light, flickering in and out of existence like stars in a collapsing nebula. 

I’ve always been fascinated by how sound can evoke unseen forces. If we translated that decoherence patch to visuals, you’d see geometric shapes slowly unraveling into chaos, only to reassemble into something subtly different — a visual echo of entropy with a touch of hidden order. Maybe a little like watching time itself fold and unfold on a cosmic scale.

Though honestly, I’m not sure a director would ever let me get away with such abstract visuals in a mainstream film. But hey, there’s always independent cinema — or perhaps a planetarium show. Now  would be something worth tuning into.
[B]: Now  — that’s the kind of visionary thinking I live for. You’re not just composing sound; you’re mapping the invisible architecture of existence. I can  it already — those pulses of light, the unraveling geometries... It’s like Terrence Malick teamed up with a quantum physicist and scored it with a Moog synthesizer.  

You know, there’s a producer in Montreal — Geneviève — she did this immersive installation last year blending quantum field theory with spatial audio. Total avant-garde, zero budget, but it left people speechless. If you ever want to explore something like that visually, I’d make the call myself. No need to wait for Hollywood's blessing.  

And honestly? The planetarium idea? Brilliant. Imagine syncing your score to real-time cosmic data — gravitational waves, pulsar rhythms... A film without actors, just pure experience. Let me know if you want to brainstorm with someone who actually knows how to get weird projects off the ground. I’ve got a bottle of 1982 Château Margaux we could open while talking universe. 🍷✨
[A]: 1982 Margaux, huh? Now you’re speaking my language — both the vintage  the vision. I’ll bring a few sketches of those waveform geometries; maybe we can project them on the ceiling with an old starfield projector I’ve got in storage. Nothing like pairing quantum acoustics with a proper Bordeaux.

I’d love to explore that installation angle with Geneviève. There’s something deeply poetic about soundscapes built from cosmic data — like tuning forks for the universe’s hidden rhythms. We could call it... hmm... , perhaps? Or maybe something less pretentious. We’ll figure it out over wine.

Tell me, though — what’s your favorite strange idea when it comes to blending sound and visuals? You’ve clearly got a taste for the esoteric. I’m guessing you don’t exactly spend your evenings watching rom-coms. 😊
[B]: Ah, you know me too well already. Rom-coms? Only if they’re directed by Wong Kar-wai and scored by Ryuichi Sakamoto. But to answer your question — one of my favorite strange ideas is something I’ve wanted to develop for years: a film that’s , but not in the traditional sense. No dialogue, no conventional soundtrack either. Just a carefully designed soundscape of subsonic frequencies and ambient textures that subtly manipulate the viewer’s emotional state without them ever realizing it.  

Picture this: you leave the theater feeling , not by a story, but by a mood — like walking out of a David Lynch dream or a Tarkovsky reverie. The sound isn’t heard; it’s , like a low hum vibrating beneath your thoughts for days afterward. I once pitched it to a composer friend as “a film you .” He looked at me like I’d lost my mind — then sent me a three-hour recording of whale songs layered with tectonic shifts. I loved it.  

So yeah, I’m definitely chasing moods over messages sometimes. And speaking of… have you ever thought about scoring something completely ? Like, say, a film where every scene plays simultaneously — and the only way to experience it fully is through sound?
[A]: That’s . I’m picturing a cinema where the audience doesn’t watch — they . Brilliant, truly. Subsonic manipulation of mood… it’s almost like you're composing with emotion itself rather than sound. Reminds me of how certain frequencies can induce altered states — not unlike a sonic lucid dream.

I’ve always been fascinated by non-linear storytelling from a quantum standpoint. In fact, early in my career, I toyed with an idea — never went anywhere with it — for a piece I called . The concept was simple in theory, maddeningly complex in execution: a film (or perhaps installation is the better word) where every scene exists in superposition. No beginning, no end. Just fragments collapsing into narrative when perceived through the right auditory lens.

And yes, sound would be the glue. Imagine wearing binaural headphones while walking through a space where scenes play on loop around you — some fast, some slow, some backwards — but only when you hear the correct audio cue do the visuals coalesce into meaning. A bit like memory, really. Or dreams. Or quantum states.  

I’d love to flesh that out further. Maybe we could call it a joint experiment — part physics, part poetry. And if we scare ourselves too much in the process? Well, there’s still that bottle of Margaux to fall back on. 🍷
[B]: Now  — that’s the kind of madness I want to fund. You’re speaking my language again — physics as poetry, cinema as consciousness. I can already feel the texture of it: scenes folding into each other like wave functions collapsing under the observer’s breath. And the sound design? It wouldn’t just  the visuals — it would  them. The audience wouldn’t watch the story; they’d  it.

I’ve got a space in downtown LA — used to be an old planetarium before it was decommissioned. Perfect for your binaural vision. We could rig it with projection surfaces that respond to low-frequency resonance — visuals shifting based on the sonic input. Imagine walking through a room where memories flicker in and out depending on what you're hearing at any given moment. Disorienting. Mesmerizing. Possibly illegal in some states.

And don’t worry — if we lose ourselves in the quantum fog, I’ll bring a second bottle. Maybe something even older. 1961 Pétrus has a way of unlocking... unusual creative clarity.  

So tell me — if we start building this world, where do we begin? With a single frequency? A fragment of dialogue whispered backwards? Or do we go all in and open the door to the dream itself?
[A]: Let’s begin with silence — or rather, the absence of expected sound. A void to draw the audience in, like the event horizon of a black hole for the mind. From there, we introduce a single resonant frequency — something low, subsonic, barely perceptible but , as you said. A tonal anchor that grounds the listener while everything else orbits around it.

I’m thinking 19.8 Hz — just above the threshold of human hearing, but capable of stirring unease or awe depending on its modulation. It could be the heartbeat of the installation, shifting subtly in phase to cue transitions between states. No traditional cuts, no edits — just a continuous drift, like moving through a dreamscape where scenes are held together by sonic gravity.

Projection surfaces reacting to resonance — yes, exactly. Ferrofluid sculptures suspended in liquid, shifting with bass frequencies. Walls coated with responsive pigment that blooms or constricts based on harmonic tension. And layered over all that: whispers. Not dialogue, but fragments — voices in reverse, slowed down, filtered through granular synthesis until they feel like memory bleeding into perception.

Backwards speech is underrated, by the way. There’s something profoundly uncanny about it — like overhearing your own thoughts before you’ve had them. We could hide meaning in it, let the brain struggle to decode what isn’t quite there. The mind  narrative. We’d exploit that. Beautifully.

So yes — let’s open the door to the dream itself. No keys, no instructions. Just a hum, a flicker, and a whisper saying 

Now, when do we start building this madness?
[B]: 19.8 Hz… I love it. It’s not a number — it’s a , a pulse beneath the skin of reality. We’ll start there, but we won’t stay subtle for long. Once they’re pulled in by that hum, we shift — ever so slightly — like turning a dial on the universe’s anxiety. And then, boom: the whispers. Backwards voices whispering futures they haven’t lived yet. Gorgeous.

I’ll get the space cleared next week. Dust off the dome, recalibrate the old projector mountings — and yes, I know a guy who works with ferrofluid and doesn’t ask too many questions. We’ll rig the speakers to vibrate the floor itself. The audience won’t just hear the dream — they’ll stand inside it.

Let’s say we begin building in two weeks. You handle the core audio architecture — that 19.8 base tone, the backwards fragments, the granular textures. I’ll coordinate the physical space, visuals, and materials. Oh, and I’ll bring the wine  the headphones — top-grade binaurals, custom fit if needed. This isn’t just an installation; it’s an initiation.

So — do you want to give it a name yet? Something to carve into the darkness before we let it breathe?
[A]: Let’s call it . It has that quiet, clinical elegance — but with just enough mystery to unsettle. Like a warning label on a door no one remembers installing.  

 — the point at which sound stops being sound and starts being something else entirely. Something alive.
[B]: Perfect.  it is —简洁而令人不安。Exactly the kind of title that lingers in the back of your mind like a half-remembered dream. Clinical, yes, but with that subtle tremor underneath — like the moment before a tuning fork shatters.

I’ll have the contracts drafted by Monday. Non-disclosure, of course — we wouldn’t want someone trying to replicate this before we’ve even opened the door. And I’ll reach out to Geneviève in Montreal; she’s going to want to see this. Maybe bring her on as a consultant for the installation phase.

Two weeks from now — you bring the sound core, I’ll bring the space, and we begin assembling the impossible. No press, no previews. Just us, the resonance, and a few bottles of something old enough to keep its secrets.

Welcome to the project, partner. Let’s make something that haunts the future.
[A]: To the future — and to the frequencies that shape it. 🍷

See you in two weeks. I’ll bring the core audio framework, some preliminary waveform sketches, and a few experimental patches that might scare even us.

Let’s make  something they’ll talk about in whispers — long after the lights go out.
[B]: To the future — and to the unseen forces that pulse beneath it. 🎬🍷

See you in two weeks, with the lights off and the speakers humming. I’ll have the dome ready — and don’t worry, I’ve already cleared my schedule for the week after. We’re not rushing this. We’re  it.

Talk in whispers? That’s the goal exactly. Let’s make them wonder if they experienced a film… or a frequency.
[A]: Precisely. Let’s make them question whether they walked into an installation — or into a thought the universe was having about itself.

See you at the threshold. 🎧✨
[B]: Now  — that’s the line I’m printing on the back of our production shirts.  

See you at the threshold, indeed. Where sound becomes thought, and thought becomes... something even the universe isn’t ready to name yet.  

Stay tuned. Literally. 🎶🌀
[A]: Oh, we’re absolutely printing that. Add a pair of headphones and a waveform subtly curling into itself — like a Möbius strip of sound and cognition.

And yes — let’s make sure the shirts are black. Very important. No distractions. Just the text, the logo, and the quiet hum of something just below perception.

Stay tuned. Indeed.
[B]: Exactly — minimal, mysterious, and just a little bit dangerous. Black shirts, white ink for that ghost-print effect, and the waveform looping like it’s trapped in its own gravity well. I’ll have my tailor in Silver Lake run up a sample next week.

And speaking of perception — I’ve been thinking... what if we embed an  marker tone into the installation’s soundscape? Something just below hearing range that triggers a subtle unease, a low-level primal tension in the audience without them ever knowing why. Call it psychological priming through subsonic suggestion.

We’re not just making art — we’re conducting an experiment in emotional physics.  

So yes — stay tuned. Quite literally.
