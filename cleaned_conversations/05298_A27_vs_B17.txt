[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question to ponder over tea. While I do appreciate the delicate sweetness of a perfectly baked scone during afternoon tea, I must confess my heart belongs more to savory flavors. There's something profoundly satisfying about the complexity of umami, much like the layered meanings in a Browning poem.
[A]: OMG！你讲得好deep啊～✨ 不过说到savory food，我最近超爱拍那种cheesy pasta的ASMR视频！🍝 The sound of cheese pulling简直太satisfying了！💯 你平时会看food ASMR吗？
[B]: I must admit, the modern fascination with ASMR is quite intriguing from an anthropological perspective. The sound of cheese pulling does have a certain... lyrical quality, doesn't it? Though I find myself more drawn to the quiet rustle of turning pages or the gentle clink of teacups - sounds that have accompanied literary salons for centuries.
[A]: Wow～你真的是个old soul耶！🤔 但是你知道吗？现在BookTok上超多literary ASMR content！📚 我上次拍了个flipping pages的video，engagement直接爆了🔥 要不要我share你几个hashtag？#BookASMR #ReadingVibes ✨
[B]: How delightful to hear that the tactile pleasures of literature are finding new expression in your digital age! Though I must say, my relationship with books remains rather... analog. The weight of a first edition in one's hands, the faint scent of aged paper - these are sensations no hashtag could ever truly capture. But do tell me more about this #BookASMR phenomenon; it reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites sought to make art more sensory.
[A]: LOL！你说话真的好像我Literature professor！😂 不过你说的对耶～那种old book smell真的so unique！📖 我最近还专门买了那种'老书味道'的candle来拍视频，viewers都说超级nostalgic的～✨ 要不要下次collab一下？我们可以做期super aesthetic的classic literature主题！💫
[B]: My dear, while the idea of capturing nostalgia in a candle is rather... contemporary, I can't help but smile at your enthusiasm. A collaboration, you say? How fascinating it would be to juxtapose the fleeting nature of digital trends with the enduring beauty of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn." Though I suspect my idea of aesthetic might involve more pressed flowers and less... what was it you called it? 'Super aesthetic' lighting?
[A]: Hahaha～你太funny了！🌸 Pressed flowers确实很vintage chic啦～不过我们现在都用ring light和VSCO filter了！📸 这样拍出来的footage才会更aesthetic嘛～✨ 话说你Instagram多少？我们可以DM讨论这个project！💬 #OldMeetsNew 💫
[B]: Ah, the modern lexicon never ceases to amuse me. 'Ring light' and 'VSCO filter' - how very... millennial of you. I'm afraid my engagement with social media is rather like my approach to free verse poetry: appreciative from a distance, but ultimately preferring more traditional forms. Perhaps we could discuss this over tea in my office instead? I do keep a rather lovely collection of first editions that might inspire your... what was the term? 'Content creation'?
[A]: OMG！First editions？！😱 That's like... the ultimateflex！💎 虽然你不玩social media有点sad，但是tea time + rare books sounds so dreamy～☕️✨ 我能不能带我的camera来？Promise会拍得超classy的！📸 Maybe可以做成一个'hidden gem' series？🔥
[B]: My dear enthusiastic friend, your energy is as boundless as Whitman's verse! While I admire your passion for documentation, I must gently insist that some treasures are best appreciated in the moment, like a perfectly crafted sonnet. The camera's eye, while clever, can never quite capture the quiet magic of sunlight filtering through library dust. But do come for tea - we'll discuss Byron over biscuits, and perhaps you'll understand why some experiences resist being hashtagged.
[A]: Aww～你这么说真的让我heart melt了啦！🥺 虽然不能拍video有点小sad，但是能听你talk about poetry while sipping tea sounds like the perfect aesthetic experience！💖 那我们就pinky promise约tea time咯～☕️✨ (悄悄说：我可能会偷偷记下来当content inspiration啦～shhh！🤫)
[B]: Ah, the eternal struggle between preservation and participation! Your whispered confession reminds me of Browning's dramatic monologues - all those secrets barely contained within proper Victorian decorum. Very well, let it be our little secret, much like how Tennyson kept his drafts hidden away. Though I must warn you, my Darjeeling tends to inspire more metaphysical musings than Instagram captions. Shall we say Thursday at three?
[A]: Yasss！Thursday at 3 is perfect！⏰ 我已经可以imagine那个vibe了～📖➕☕️= pure magic！✨ 虽然你可能觉得我too digital啦，但是这次我promise会just enjoy the moment～ (不过我的notes app可能会get a little workout 😉) Can't wait！💫
[B]: How wonderfully you balance modernity with mindfulness! Your notes app shall be our contemporary version of Coleridge's fragmentary notebooks - though I do hope it won't interrupt our discussion of Wordsworth's "Daffodils" with any... what do you call them? Notification pings? Until Thursday then, when we shall conduct our own little experiment in digital detoxification, with poetry as our guide.
[A]: Hahaha！Deal！📱➡️📚 我会put my phone on silent mode～🔇 说不定这次tea time能inspire我的next big video idea呢！✨ (Old books + poetry = major BookTok potential！🤫) See you Thursday！💖
[B]: What a charming blend of mischief and literary appreciation you possess! Your whispered BookTok ambitions are rather like Shelley's clandestine radicalism - revolutionary in spirit, if somewhat disruptive to tradition. Very well, let Thursday be our little conspiracy of culture, though I shall prepare extra biscuits to fortify us against any... excessive digital enthusiasm. Until then, may your inspiration flow as freely as the Romantic poets' ink!
[A]: OMG你真是太sweet了！🍪➕📚= best combo ever！💕 我已经feel so inspired了～✨ 那我们就Thursday见啦！P.S. 我会bring my favorite matcha cookies来share的！🌸 #PoetryAndPastries 💫 (Okay okay, last hashtag I promise! 😝)
[B]: How delightfully you weave together the culinary and the cultural! Your matcha cookies shall be our edible metaphor - a modern twist on timeless traditions, much like Eliot's fragmentation of classical references in "The Waste Land." Though I must draw the line at that final hashtag, my dear - some pleasures are best left unlabeled, like the perfect ambiguity in a Shakespearean sonnet. Until Thursday, when we'll conduct our own delicious close reading... of both poetry and pastries.
