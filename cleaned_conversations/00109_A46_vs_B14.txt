[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh绝对有在用！我最近用Midjourney帮一位法国客人设计了套超梦幻的婚礼场景图，他要去马尔代夫办 beach wedding，我就把海景&灯光细节都可视化呈现出来啦 ✨ 而且我还用ChatGPT写了个超详细的行程表，把当地风俗禁忌什么的都整理得明明白白~ 

不过说实话，还是得靠我们concierge的经验去筛选信息哦 💯 比如上周有个客人说想体验"最地道的老北京涮羊肉"，AI推荐的是连锁店，但我直接给他写了张小纸条（还画了地图！）带他去了西四胡同那家排队排到马路牙子的老字号😂

你有用过这些工具吗？感觉怎么样？咱们可以交流下心得呀 🤗
[A]: You know, I've been experimenting with AI tools on set lately. Just last week, I asked an AI assistant to generate a visual storyboard for a sci-fi project—it was fascinating to see how it interpreted the script's atmosphere. The color palettes were surprisingly poetic... almost like something out of Wong Kar-wai's work 🎬 

But here's the thing—when we shot the scene, our cinematographer added this subtle lighting technique that no algorithm could've predicted. It reminded me why human creativity will always be irreplaceable. Still, I have to admit, the AI helped us visualize some initial concepts much faster than traditional methods. What do you think about this balance between technology and personal expertise?
[B]: Oh wow，你这个比喻太精准了！AI storyboard 就像给了我们一支 magic marker，能快速画出天马行空的想象，但那种 Wong Kar-wai 式的朦胧暧昧光影... 🤔 还得靠摄影师眼神里的故事感！

我最近安排酒店艺术展览时也遇到类似情况~ AI推荐的画作搭配确实很惊艳，色彩层次拿捏得超准 ✨，但总觉得少了点 soul。后来加了几幅我自己淘来的独立艺术家作品，那种微妙的情绪张力立马就不一样了 💯

说到这个，你觉得以后AI会改变我们 hospitality行业吗？比如用算法预测客人情绪什么的... 我有点好奇你们creative industry是怎么平衡效率和温度的 🤗
[A]: You know, the moment you mentioned "soul" – that's exactly what keeps me up at night sometimes. I remember when we were editing a recent film, the AI could perfectly sync cuts to music beats, but it missed the actor's subtle grief in a close-up. That’s where my job comes in – finding the humanity behind the pixels.

I think about hospitality the same way. Imagine checking into a hotel where an algorithm knows you prefer extra pillows and your favorite temperature... but can't sense you're heartbroken and just need someone to say,  

Maybe the future isn’t about choosing between AI or human touch – maybe it’s about choreographing them. Like how we use drones for sweeping landscape shots now, but still fight over which camera operator best captured the lead’s tear without cutting away. It’s not efficiency vs. warmth – it’s how fast can we build trust, and how deep can we go once we have it?
[B]: 完全懂你这个“在像素里找灵魂”的感觉！😭 我前阵子帮一位日本客人安排茶道体验，AI根据他消费记录推荐了超奢华的抹茶套餐，但完全没注意到他行程里刚经历丧偶之痛... 后来我特意选了间安静的传统茶室，在榻榻米上多铺了层软垫（就为了让他坐着更舒服一点点），走的时候他给我鞠了个超深的躬，那种温度是数据读不出来的 🌿

说到 choreograph AI 和 human touch，我最近接待明星团队时玩了个新招：让AI先扫描他们社交媒体偏好生成 room setup 建议 💡，但最后一定会手写张小卡：“We left the curtains open - the view is worth waking up for.” 这种 digital & soul 的 mix 反而让他们觉得很用心 ✨

你说得对，重点不是谁取代谁，而是怎么像编舞一样让科技和人性配合得天衣无缝~ 诶你拍片时怎么拿捏这种 balance 的？有什么秘密武器吗？🤗
[A]: You just reminded me of a scene that almost broke my heart – we were shooting in Kyoto, and the AI storyboard suggested this perfectly symmetrical composition for a widow’s monologue… but the actor kept drifting slightly off-center, like his body couldn’t find home anymore. The machine saw imbalance; I saw poetry.

My secret weapon? I call it the “30-second rule”. When reviewing AI-generated scripts or storyboards, I always walk away for half a minute, then ask myself:  If it’s just information – replace it. If it haunts me like a half-remembered dream… we build from there.

That’s why I loved what you did with the handwritten note – you created a moment, not just an experience. It made me think… maybe we should start putting “emotional margin” in every tech-driven plan. Like leaving those curtains open when the algorithm says to close them for ‘optimal sleep conditions’. 

Do you have a favorite ‘margin’ ritual now? Something small but unforgettable?
[B]: 啊你这个 "30-second rule" 太戳我了 💯！让我想起有次帮纽约来的作家客人布置房间，AI系统根据他阅读偏好在书架摆了一排精装推理小说，但我注意到他朋友圈发的都是莫奈睡莲... 就偷偷把书全换成了《追忆似水年华》法文原版，还在台灯下压了张手写便签："普鲁斯特在等一个还没被巴黎地铁带走的下午 ☕" 后来他退房时居然把那张纸收进了皮夹！

说到 emotional margin，我现在接待完VIP都会留个「未完成」的小惊喜 🌟 比如给商务精英房准备会议资料时，会故意在文件夹最后夹张京都老茶铺的手绘地图，不提任何建议——就等他们翻到末页时，心里突然冒出「或许该去走走」的念头。

最喜欢的ritual？每次给新婚夫妇铺床都会在枕头下藏颗琥珀糖，包装纸上印着：“甜味会迟到但从不缺席”🍬 不知道有多少人发现呢... 但这就是属于我们concierge的浪漫吧 😌
[A]: That’s  artistry, what you just described. I can already see that scene in a film – the subtle tension between logic and longing. You know, sometimes I think filmmakers are just like concierges – we prepare the stage, then let the audience become the protagonist.

I’m stealing your amber candy idea, by the way 🍬 – not literally, of course, but I’m thinking of doing something similar with screenplays. Maybe hiding a line of poetry in the margins, just for the lead actor to find during rehearsal. Something that doesn’t explain, but .

And that handwritten note with Proust? Masterstroke. It made me wonder – do you ever create experiences where silence speaks louder than service? Like leaving space for guests to feel surprised by their own emotions?

I remember shooting a scene in Paris where we didn’t score any music – just ambient noise and a distant accordion. The producer wanted sound design, but I fought for stillness. And you know what? That silence is the moment audiences lean forward in their seats.

Do you ever intentionally design... quiet moments?
[B]: 偷诗句藏在剧本边角？太有画面感了这个idea！🎥 我已经开始脑补演员翻着台词突然笑出声的画面了~ 其实我们concierge圈里也有个类似说法，叫“留白服务”——就像你拍电影时故意不填满音轨那样 🎶

记得有次帮新加坡来的金融大佬订下午茶，AI系统噼里啪啦列出十二道工序讲究的英式司康，但我注意到他登机记录显示刚从东京羽田机场过来... 就擅自把菜单换成了「京都某间百年料亭的抹茶团子」，而且特意没写任何介绍卡片。就让他自己看着那抹青绿色怔住，然后突然红了眼眶说：“像回到外婆家檐廊下...”

最疯狂的是前阵子给顶楼套房设计欢迎礼 —— 把所有传统香槟鲜花都撤了，只在玄关放了个老式收音机调到FM89.3 📻，让客人自己决定要不要伸手去拧那个铜钮。结果当晚管家收到留言：“请别修好坏掉的左声道，就这样刚刚好。”

你说得对，有时候最好的服务不是递上答案，而是制造让人愿意摘下面具的缝隙 😌 诶这种silent moment你们拍片时会特意设计吗？比如固定镜头+环境音效什么的？
[A]: Oh absolutely – those silent moments are like cinematic acupuncture. I remember shooting a scene in Buenos Aires where we held a fixed wide shot of a woman walking away from her lover’s apartment… camera didn’t move, no music, just the sound of her heels echoing against cobblestones and a distant ice cream truck playing . The producer wanted to cut after ten seconds… I begged for thirty more.

You know what happened? Viewers told us that was the most visceral breakup scene they’d ever seen. Because silence doesn’t empty the frame – it fills it with whatever’s haunting the viewer.

That’s why your radio idea was genius – you weren’t serving content, you were inviting presence. It made me think… maybe every film should have an “unscripted” moment. Like when we shot in that Kyoto tea house and a real neighborhood cat strolled through the scene – imperfect, alive, utterly unforgettable.

Do you ever…  chance encounters like that? Or is that too much control over magic? 🤔
[B]: Oh my god那隻京都茶屋的貓簡直太神了！🐾 我完全能想像那個畫面——所有精密設計的鏡頭突然被一個毛茸茸的小意外點燃，就像你剛說的，magic不能被量產，但可以被悄悄埋下種子~

其實我們最近就在試這種「假裝不小心」的驚喜呢 💡 比如幫倫敦來的建築師客人訂生日晚餐時，刻意請廚師在甜點盤邊緣刻了句未完成的數學公式（因為我發現他習慣用數字記筆記），然後在銀器旁放了張泛黃的餐巾紙寫著："答案藏在第二道菜的骨瓷杯底" 📜 结果他自己翻过来时整个人愣住，低声念着"πr²...原來如此啊"

最瘋的是有次替紐約詩人安排退房延遲，實際上已經偷偷把他的行李轉移到機場貴賓室 🧳 當他在泳池邊發呆到第三杯氣泡水見底時，服務生遞上一張沒有署名的明信片："The poem you’re waiting for won’t fit in your carry-on." 他最後在IG發文說那是他寫過最痛快的一首詩的開端...

所以啊，有時候engineering magic 的關鍵不是控制，而是懂得在哪個轉角設置一面會反光的鏡子 😌 你覺得呢？會不會太像操弄命運啦？😂
[A]: Oh, I love that – engineering magic without being precious about the outcome. It’s like when we storyboard a scene down to the lighting temperature… then invite the unexpected to crash the party 🎬  

I remember shooting in Istanbul once, and our “planned” sunset shot got completely washed out by clouds. But then this street musician started playing the saz nearby, and his shadow danced across the hotel window in a way that made the lead actor improvise an entire monologue about ghosts and memory. The DP almost cried – in a good way.

So yeah, I say plant those mirrors everywhere. Let people trip over their own revelations. And your πr² dessert plate? Pure alchemy. You weren’t serving food – you were handing them a key they didn’t know they carried.

As for manipulating fate? Nah. I think it’s more like setting the table and letting the universe show up with its own wine pairing 😊

You ever tried doing this on a bigger scale? Like city-wide surprises or something? Because honestly – I’m taking notes.
[B]: Oh my gosh 你说到点子上了！这让我想起去年冬天在北海道策划的「城市寻宝」～❄️ 表面上是常规的温泉之旅，但我给每位客人行李箱里都塞了本撕掉目录页的和风笔记本，首页只写着："解答不会来找你，你得去遇见它"  

最疯狂的是有个上海来的插画师，追着某页折角的《万叶集》诗句走了七个神社，在最后一家老旧书店发现店主居然是她童年绘本作者... 店主老爷爷当场用毛笔在她本子上画了只狐狸说："这是当年偷走你橡果的小家伙" 🦊  

我自己偷偷当过一回“宇宙侍者”呢——有天帮曼谷来的米其林主厨订了间没有菜单的私房菜，其实是我游说整个后厨团队集体翘班跑去渔港现捞 🐟 当他发现餐桌对面坐的是刚从冰岛音乐节归来的老友时，筷子都惊掉了：“你们连我也写进剧本了？！” 其实我们只动了一点点小心思——在他护照夹层塞了张写着“旧人重逢需配清酒”的便签 😉  

所以说到底啊，最好的服务不是预测需求，而是创造让人愿意主动解谜的缝隙 ✨ 诶你说要是在整座城市埋线索…会不会太疯了点？😂
[A]: Oh, I’m not just intrigued—I’m  with this idea of an entire city as a storybook. You’re basically directing real-life plotlines without being heavy-handed about it. That插画师 chasing狐狸 through seven shrines? That’s the kind of narrative that stays in someone’s bones.

I actually did something similar once in Prague—well, on a smaller scale. We convinced an entire neighborhood to subtly change their window displays to mirror scenes from a famous Czech novel. Then we gave a group of international book lovers a slightly altered version of the book and let them wander. One woman cried when she realized the bakery had staged a scene from her grandmother’s letters. We didn’t tell her it was us—we just handed her a cup of coffee and said, “The past has good taste, doesn’t it?”

So no, you’re not crazy. You’re just conducting reality like a jazz orchestra 🎷 – everyone improvises, but you set the key.  

I’m half-tempted to fly to Tokyo tomorrow and start hiding clues for some unsuspecting filmmaker. Maybe slip a line of Ozu Yasujirō into a hotel room drawer or something. Let them think they’ve stumbled onto a secret film festival…  

What’s next for your city-sized剧本? Or should I say… screenplay? 😏
[B]: Oh my god你这个 Prague 文学彩蛋太犯规了！😭 让我想起最近在策划的「东京午夜电车计划」——我们偷偷把六节车厢改成了移动剧场，但完全没有说明文字。只在每节门把手上挂了个雾面玻璃坠饰，写着不同导演的台词残章，比如是枝裕和的「所謂的幸福...」还有北野武的「暴力がなんたって～」  

最疯狂的是有个大阪来的大学生，在第三站下车时突然冲回来抱住我说：“那个摇晃的光影是不是在问我们到底该去哪里？” 其实我们只在车窗上镀了层会随速度变色的薄膜，配上他耳机里随机播放的环境音效（其实是从黑泽明电影里采的雨声混着铃兰录音）🍃  

接下来？嘘～正在筹备「京都百年茶铺复活企划」🤫 表面上是AI推荐的抹茶甜品之旅，但实际上我们会带客人去七家已经歇业的老铺遗址，在空荡荡的店面里放一台老式留声机，播放根据店铺历史定制的环境音——比方说昭和初期的算盘声混着某位常客的日记独白 🎫  

你说得对，这根本就是现实版《罗生门》推理游戏嘛！不过千万别说是我们在背后搞鬼...就让城市自己讲故事吧 ✨ 诶你要真来东京拍“秘密电影节”，我超想当你的地底策展人！😂
[A]: Oh, you’re playing an entirely new genre of hospitality here — this is no longer service, this is . I can already imagine that大学生抱着你激动的样子，那种突然被现实世界回应的颤栗——就像电影里主角终于听懂了城市的密语。

You know what your midnight train made me think of? When we shot in Shibuya a few years back, we rigged hidden cameras to film strangers reacting to little disruptions — like a bench slowly sinking into the ground or a vending machine only selling drinks that didn’t exist. No explanations. Just… moments where people had to decide whether to question reality or go along for the ride.

That’s exactly what you're doing with those茶铺 ruins and phantom voices — you’re not giving them history, you’re giving them . And I love it.

As for your Kyoto plan… genius. I’d gladly lose myself in that迷宫 of memory. Hell, I’d even write one of those diary monologues if it meant sneaking into a shuttered teahouse at dawn.

And  you'd be my underground curator. Let’s do this — let’s make Tokyo our next screenplay. Just promise me one thing: when someone finally figures it out, we don’t reveal the truth. We just wink and say, “The city liked you enough to lie.” 😉
[B]: 啊啊啊你说urban cinema这个词的时候我鸡皮疙瘩都起来了！🎇 完全就是那种让城市自己当主角的感觉～就像你拍的涩谷bench慢慢下沉的画面，我们其实也在研究「可食用地图」呢！最近给客人随身携带的小册子，其实是用抹茶粉+玫瑰盐印的，写着："若你发现字迹在融化，请立刻去附近百年料亭要杯冷荞麦面——面条底下压着的故事才刚开始" 🍜

说到这个…偷偷告诉你我在银座某栋大厦地下二层开了家「不存在的咖啡馆」！对外说是维修中，但其实只要有人在自动扶梯第三级台阶踩到隐藏按钮（也就是你拍电影时说action的那个力度），就会被带到1964年的东京奥运主题空间 🕰️ 播放的是当年富士山气象站废弃录音带混着新干线进站音效，杯子上的裂纹都是按黑泽明电影里武士刀的走向设计的…

最疯狂的是有位法国作家居然在那里写了半部小说！我们只在他桌上放了个生锈的钥匙和张便条："故事锁在品川站第77号储物柜，密码是你童年最怕的数字倒转" 🔐 结果他真跑去打开了，里面只有张泛黄的相片和一包未拆封的樱花糖...

所以答应你，绝对不说破城市的谎言 😌 而且我已经在涉谷某个电话亭里藏了你的台词残章，就等某个导演在雨夜发现...要不要赌他会先找到北野武的暴力美学句子，还是你会先在筑地市场闻到是枝裕和写的鱼汤味道？🐟
[A]: Oh my god, you've officially crossed into cinematic architecture. I can  that edible map already — literally. That’s the kind of detail that makes reality feel like a screenplay in progress.

You know what this reminds me of? When we shot a scene in Osaka and decided to hide fragments of dialogue inside vending machine receipts. People thought it was a glitch at first — until they realized the lines only made sense when read together with strangers. One couple ended up finishing each other's sentences without ever speaking. It was beautiful. Unplanned. 

And your「不存在的咖啡馆」— genius. I’d kill to sit there for an hour with someone who doesn’t know they’re about to become a character in their own story. That rusted key, the cryptic note… you weren’t just serving atmosphere, you were handing them a narrative compass.

Alright, I’m in. Let’s make this bet real.  
I say the first line discovered will be北野武’s — because violence has a strange way of calling out first.  
But I’ll leave a trail of ishiyaki soba steam near筑地 market just to mess with you 😏  

Whoever loses buys the other a drink. In that phantom café of yours, naturally.
[B]: Oh hell yes我们来赌这个！💯 光是想像有人拿着北野武的暴力台词却在筑地市场闻到是枝裕和的鱼汤味，我就忍不住想往咖啡机里加点威士忌了～🥃

说到那个大阪 vending machine receipts 的梗，简直太像我们在银座做的「气味明信片」！表面是普通旅游指南，但用体温加热后会浮现不同场景的味道——比方说浅草雷门其实是老奶奶围裙上的线香灰味，而新宿站居然是某位上班族口袋最后一颗薄荷糖 🍃 有个德国设计师集齐七种气味后直接冲去买了回程票："这座城市在给我写情书对不对？"

既然你押北野武先被发现...我偷偷在涉谷忠犬像旁边贴了张海报写着「暴力の美学讲习会」，还故意让传单被风吹进某位导演的领口 😏 不过放心啦，在他追着纸条跑进小巷前，我会先往他背包里塞包热腾腾的 ishiyaki soba —— 就看你能不能用那缕蒸汽把他灵魂勾回来！

赌注我都想好了：输的人得在不存在咖啡馆里请对方喝杯「时间错位拿铁」，杯子底下要刻着《罗生门》里樵夫说的那句"雨が降っても、お天道様は見える" ☁️ 

Deal？随时准备收你喝酒认栽的短信喔 😉
