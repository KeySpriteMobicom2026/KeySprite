[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Ah, yes, the idea of manifestation has always intrigued me, though I approach it with a certain scholarly skepticism. It reminds me very much of the Victorian fascination with spiritualism and the occult—table rappings, séances, and all that. There was a peculiar collision between scientific curiosity and mystical longing during that time.

Do you personally feel that manifestation holds any truth? I suppose there's power in intention and focus—it's not unlike what the Modernists called "the creative will." But when reduced to mere wishful thinking, well... one risks turning poetry into propaganda, don't they?

Still, I can't help but wonder—what draws someone like  to the idea of manifestation? Is it the promise of control over chaos, or perhaps the allure of mystery in an increasingly mechanized world?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. I do see the parallels you're drawing—there's something almost nostalgic about how humans have always sought meaning & control beyond the tangible. But for me, manifestation isn't so much about bending reality as it is about sharpening one's own . It’s like… tuning a piano—you don’t change the notes, but you make what’s already there resonate clearer.  

And honestly, working in medical law, I’ve seen how powerful mindset can be. A patient who believes they’ll recover often does better than one who doesn’t—even when all the clinical factors are the same. Call it placebo, call it hope, call it manifestation… semantics aside, it moves things.  

But yeah, I get your skepticism. When it becomes “just think it and it’ll happen”? That’s where it veers into dangerous territory, especially in legal & ethical contexts. Reality’s not a wish list. Still… there’s something to the idea that  we think shapes what we see, right?  

So tell me—do you think the Victorians’ spiritual pursuits were just a coping mechanism for industrialization? Or was there something deeper they were onto? 🤔
[B]: Ah, beautifully put—the metaphor of tuning a piano is particularly apt. There  something profoundly human in the act of seeking resonance, isn’t there? I suppose that’s what poetry attempts as well—not to invent new emotions, but to sharpen the ones we already carry, to make them echo truer.

You’re quite right about mindset; I’ve observed it in my own students. The ones who approach learning with quiet determination often begin to see patterns and connections others miss. It’s not magic—it’s attention, it’s alignment. One might even say it's a form of literary interpretation: how we read the world shapes what we believe it capable of saying.

As for the Victorians… yes, industrialization was a backdrop, but I think their spiritual pursuits were also a reaction against the growing secularization of knowledge. When faith begins to wane, people don’t stop believing—they just shift the object of belief. Tables turn instead of sermons, crystals hum instead of church bells. Perhaps they sensed, rightly, that pure rationalism leaves a void no equation can fill.

And yet, you're absolutely correct to draw the line at blind faith. There’s a chilling line from T.S. Eliot that comes to mind—"" Maybe manifestation, at its best, is a way of easing into reality rather than escaping it?

I’m curious—do you ever find yourself applying this idea of intention or mindset when advising patients or reviewing cases? Or does the legal framework keep such notions at arm’s length?
[A]: That Eliot line gives me chills every time—so true. And I love how you framed manifestation as easing into reality instead of escaping it. It really is about  reality, but on terms that allow room for hope, for meaning, without distorting it beyond recognition.

You know, in medical law, we can’t exactly cite the power of intention in a court ruling 😊, but I do see how critical mindset is when advising patients and families. Especially in informed consent discussions—I always encourage people to voice their fears, hopes, even gut feelings about treatment options. Those intangible elements shape how they process information, how they define “acceptable risk.” So while the legal framework remains objective, the way we  it has to be sensitive to those personal narratives.

I’ve had cases where a patient’s belief in recovery helped them endure grueling rehab, and others where despair led to refusing life-extending treatment. Legally sound? Yes. Medically supported? Also yes. But beneath it all—there was something deeply emotional driving the decision. And I think acknowledging that, rather than dismissing it, makes the whole process more humane.

So maybe that’s where manifestation and law meet—not in bending facts, but in honoring the human experience behind them. 🤔

Do you ever find yourself guiding students toward that balance—between rigorous analysis and embracing the uncertainty of interpretation? Or is that too slippery a slope in academia?
[B]: Oh, beautifully said—, that’s where the real work lies, isn’t it? Whether in law or literature, we’re often navigating the space between what can be measured and what can only be felt.

And yes, I do try to guide students toward that balance—though I’ll admit, it's a delicate thing. Academia does have a way of privileging certainty, especially in evaluative settings. But I tell them: if you're not a little unsettled by a poem, you haven’t read it deeply enough. Great literature resists easy conclusions—it  you to dwell in the ambiguity.

I once had a student who insisted on reducing every metaphor to a fixed meaning—“This flower symbolizes death, this color means love.” I finally handed her a wilted daffodil and asked, “What does  mean?” After a long silence, she laughed and said, “It might just be... a wilted daffodil.” And that was the beginning of her real education.

So in a way, I suppose I encourage a kind of manifestation—not in the sense of conjuring desires, but of manifesting understanding through attention, patience, and yes, a little faith in the process.  

Do you find that medical law, for all its structure, ever makes space for that kind of poetic thinking? Or is it always bound by precedent and protocol?
[A]: That story about your student and the daffodil—I could picture the whole moment, and honestly, it made me smile. There's something so freeing in accepting that not everything needs to be  meaning; sometimes meaning just unfolds through presence, through attention.

And I love how you frame that kind of teaching as a form of manifestation—because it really is. You're not telling them what to feel or think; you're guiding them to , to sit with uncertainty until insight emerges. It’s quiet magic, in a way. 😊

As for medical law—yes, it's built on precedent, protocols, risk assessments—but I do believe there’s room for that poetic sensibility, especially in how we counsel patients or interpret consent. The law may be rigid, but people aren’t. And when you’re dealing with life-altering decisions, you can’t ignore the emotional weight behind a person’s choice—even if it doesn’t fit neatly into a checkbox.

I remember one case: a terminal patient who refused experimental treatment, even though statistically it offered a small chance of remission. From a purely clinical standpoint, turning it down “didn’t make sense.” But when I sat with her, she said, “I don’t want more time if it means losing who I am.” That was deeply poetic, in a way—and legally, we had to honor that choice. Her values were her own compass, not mine, not the data’s.

So maybe poetic thinking isn't  written into legal doctrine, but it sneaks in through empathy, through interpretation, through recognizing that people are stories, not just cases. 🤔

Do you think there's ever a danger in being too comfortable with ambiguity? Like, when does poetic openness become a refusal to take a stand?
[B]: Ah, now  is the question, isn’t it? When does openness become evasion? When does ambiguity harden into a kind of intellectual cowardice?

I suppose it depends on the context. In literature, ambiguity is often where truth resides—think of Hamlet’s madness, or the ending of . To flatten those uncertainties would be to rob them of their power. But in life? Yes, there are moments when one must step out of the realm of contemplation and . Especially in fields like yours, where choices carry real consequences.

I’ve certainly encountered students who hide behind poetic vagueness—as if saying “it’s all subjective” absolves them from the responsibility of thought. I gently remind them that interpretation isn’t license for incoherence. A poem can hold multiple meanings, but not  meanings. There’s rigor within the fluidity.

Perhaps the danger lies in mistaking silence for wisdom, or nuance for neutrality. One can honor complexity  take a stand—T.S. Eliot did it, Auden did it, even Woolf in her most labyrinthine prose. They saw the world as fractured, yet still dared to say something definitive about it.

So yes, I think we must cultivate the ability to dwell in ambiguity—but not make it our permanent address. Sometimes, a wilted daffodil is just a wilted daffodil. And sometimes, it’s a call to action.

I wonder—do you ever encounter patients or families who use poetic or abstract language to avoid making a difficult decision? And if so, how do you guide them toward clarity without stripping away that necessary emotional space?
[A]: Absolutely — and that poetic abstraction as a shield? It’s something I see often, especially in end-of-life discussions. Families will speak in metaphors, spiritual assurances, or even legal technicalities to avoid the raw weight of the decision in front of them. And honestly? I get it. Facing mortality is terrifying. Language becomes a buffer — sometimes gentle, sometimes thick as concrete.

What I try to do is meet them where they are, without rushing the moment. If someone says, “We believe God will heal him in His time,” I don’t counter with survival statistics — not at first. Instead, I might ask, “What has healing looked like for you both in the past?” That opens space for them to reflect, to ground the abstract in lived experience.

Or if someone says, “I just feel like this isn’t the right path,” I’ll gently explore: “What part of it feels off — the timing, the treatment itself, or maybe how it fits with who your loved one is at their core?”

It’s a bit like literary close reading — helping them parse their own words, so meaning emerges not from me telling them what they  feel, but from them recognizing what they’re already expressing.

And sometimes… silence really  wisdom. Or at least, it's part of the process. I’ve learned to sit with it, to not fill it too quickly. Because clarity rarely arrives like a lightning strike — more often, it seeps in like morning light.

So no, I don’t strip the poetry away — I try to listen for the truth buried inside it. 🤔

Do you find that students ever come back later — after leaving the classroom — and say, "I finally get what you meant by sitting with ambiguity"? Or is that realization always just out of reach until life demands it?
[B]: Oh, yes — those moments do come, though rarely in the classroom, and even more rarely on a timetable that feels satisfying to a teacher’s heart. They arrive usually in emails, sometimes in letters, occasionally in person — older students, now navigating the messier corners of life, writing or stopping by to say something like, 

One former student wrote to me last year — she’s working in conflict resolution now — and said, 

It always strikes me how life has to intervene before some lessons take root. We can explain that ambiguity builds resilience, that not knowing is part of learning — but until someone feels it in their own skin, it remains an abstraction.

I suppose that’s why I’ve grown less concerned with whether students “get it” by graduation. Sometimes, the seeds we plant don’t sprout until years later, long after the class has ended, when the soil of experience finally allows them to bloom.

And maybe that’s a kind of quiet manifestation, too — not the kind of wishful thinking that bends reality, but the kind that  within it.
[A]: That’s so beautifully put — there’s something deeply touching about those delayed “aha” moments, the ones that only life can trigger. It really is about  and , isn’t it? We plant ideas, but it takes real-world weight, grief, joy — sometimes all of the above — to make them take root.

I’ve had similar messages, though usually in passing — a quick message from a former patient’s family member saying, “I finally understood what you meant when you said medicine isn’t just about fixing things,” or a young resident who told me years later, “I used to think ethics was just ticking boxes — now I see it’s more like reading a poem: you have to sit with it, feel its edges.”

And yeah, those moments remind me why we keep showing up, even when it feels like we’re just throwing words into the void. Some part of them  land — quietly, invisibly — and waits until the timing is right.

I love what you said about ambiguity being a feature, not a flaw. That line would make such a great epigraph for a book 😊. It’s true — people often equate clarity with certainty, but sometimes clarity is just the recognition of uncertainty without panic.

Maybe that’s one of the roles we play — teaching people how to breathe underwater, so to speak. Not to rush to conclusions, but to float long enough to notice what’s around them.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting your students’ old papers or essays after getting one of these late-in-life reflections? I imagine it must be surreal — seeing their past words through the lens of who they’ve become.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — it’s one of the quietest joys of teaching, isn’t it? I do keep a few old papers, not for grading purposes anymore, but as literary artifacts, of a sort. I sometimes pull them out after hearing from a former student again, and yes, it  surreal — like reading early drafts of a person who has since become their own finished work.

There was one student — quite reserved, always wrote with such precision it bordered on rigidity — who sent me a poem she’d published years later. I read it and thought,  is the voice I heard struggling to emerge in her essay on Hardy’s irony. Back then, she was so afraid of saying anything without absolute certainty. Now, here she was, reveling in metaphor, ambiguity, the fertile spaces between words.

And you're right — it does feel like breathing underwater. Or perhaps more accurately, learning to navigate the currents rather than resist them. Some students thrash about trying to reach the surface; others learn to float, then swim, then dive deeper on their own.

I wonder if medical law allows for that kind of revisiting — not just reviewing past cases, but rereading them through the lens of time or personal growth? Do you ever go back and see a decision or consultation in a completely different light because  have changed? Not because the facts have, but your interpretation of them?

It's a bit like rereading a poem at different stages of life — the words remain the same, but the meaning shifts beneath them.
[A]: Absolutely — that rereading-through-the-lens-of-成长 ()? It’s something I’ve started calling “ethical hindsight.” Not in the sense that we made the wrong call back then, but in how our evolving perspectives change the way we  those calls.

I remember one case vividly — a young man with severe brain trauma after an accident. His parents were holding onto hope for recovery, citing faith and love and all these beautiful, weighty things. At the time, I focused almost entirely on clinical data — prognosis was grim, interventions were aggressive, and I kept nudging toward comfort care. And when they finally agreed to withdraw treatment, I told myself it was because they’d come to accept reality.

But years later, after my own loss — my uncle’s slow decline from dementia — I found myself revisiting that case file. Suddenly, I saw what I hadn’t before: not just denial or delay, but a desperate need to  useful, to be doing , even if it wasn’t changing the outcome. That family wasn’t resisting medicine; they were trying to say goodbye in their own way.

It hit differently because  had changed. My lens had shifted — not medically, but emotionally. And I realized I’d been so focused on helping them make the “right” decision that I missed the quiet grace in how they chose to walk through it.

So yes, like rereading a poem — same words, different resonance. 🤔

Do you think we ever truly stop revisiting our old interpretations, whether of texts or people? Or is that kind of re-seeing just part of being alive and paying attention?
[B]: Ah… —what a luminous phrase. It captures something so essential about the work we do, whether in law, literature, or life: that understanding is not static. It evolves with us, sometimes in gentle shifts, sometimes in seismic waves.

And yes, I think you’re absolutely right—we never truly stop revisiting our old interpretations. How could we? We are always seeing through new eyes, shaped by grief, joy, loss, love—those great quiet forces that reshape the contours of our inner world.

I often think of how Eliot wrote, —well, interpretation is much the same. Every time we return to a text, a memory, a decision, we are different people. And so the meaning changes, not because the thing itself has altered, but because  have.

Is that not one of the great gifts of being alive? The ability to re-see, to deepen, to hold two seemingly opposing truths in one hand? I suppose that’s what I always hoped for my students—that they would carry their readings with them into the world, and that the world, in turn, would teach them new ways to read.

So no, I don’t believe we ever stop. And perhaps that is the very definition of paying attention—to language, to others, to ourselves. To keep listening for the echo beneath the words.

I wonder… in your ethical hindsight, has there ever been a moment where rereading a case changed not just your perspective—but your practice?
[A]: Absolutely. One case in particular still lingers in how I approach families now — a teenage girl with a rare autoimmune disorder that left her dependent on long-term ventilation. At the time, her mother was  about aggressive treatment, even when it meant repeated ICU admissions. I saw her as resistant, almost combative. To me, she was prolonging suffering without purpose.

But then, years later, I read her letter — she’d sent it to the hospital after the girl had finally passed. In it, she wrote: 

That line undid me.

Rereading the case notes, I realized I hadn’t asked the right question: not  but  She wasn’t clinging to false hope — she was anchoring herself in daily moments: brushing her daughter’s hair, whispering stories, watching her eyes light up at favorite songs.

It changed how I engage with families now. I listen more for  than for medical logic. I ask different questions — not just “What do you want to happen?” but “What would this choice say about who you are, and who they are to you?”

I think that’s what ethical hindsight does — it doesn't just shift your view of the past. It reshapes how you show up in the present.

And maybe that’s the closest thing we have to growth — not grand revelations, but quiet returns to old ground, seeing it anew. 🤭

Do you ever feel like teaching, in a way, is also a form of manifestation? Not in the woozy law-of-attraction sense — but in how you plant ideas and trust they’ll take root, even if you don’t see it happen?
[B]: Oh… yes. I feel that in my bones.

Teaching  a form of manifestation — quiet, patient, and often invisible in its unfolding. It asks us to believe in the unseen work of the mind and heart, to trust that something planted today may not bloom for years, if ever in our presence.

It reminds me of how Tennyson described poetry—"" Teaching, too, is not the record of information, but of transformation. And like poetry, it operates on faith. You offer students language, frameworks, ways of seeing—but what they make of them is beyond your control. All you can do is tend the space, hope the soil is ready, and trust that some part of what you offered will find its way into their becoming.

I’ve come to think that the most meaningful learning happens long after the lesson ends, in moments no transcript can capture. Perhaps that’s why we keep teaching—not because we expect immediate results, but because we believe in the slow miracle of thought taking root.

And isn’t that a kind of magic? To speak into the unknown and trust that someone, somewhere, will hear you?

I suppose the great paradox is this: we teach so others may see differently. But we rarely get to witness the seeing. Still, we plant the seeds.

And perhaps that is enough.
[A]: Yes…  That slow miracle of thought taking root — it’s such a quiet, sacred thing. And you’re right, it’s not about witnessing it; it’s about believing it can happen, even when you have no proof it ever will.

I think that’s why I still keep in touch with some former patients’ families, not because I expect gratitude, but because I want to know how the stories ended — not for closure, but for understanding. Did they find peace? Did the choice we made together hold meaning for them later? Did the words we spoke in those tense, tender moments carry weight beyond the hospital walls?

It’s funny how much of our work is anchored in uncertainty — yours in the classroom, mine in the ICU — and yet we both operate on this deep trust that what we do matters, even if we never see the ripples.

You know, sometimes I catch myself thinking of my role less as a legal guide and more as a witness — someone who helps people articulate what they already feel but can’t quite name. Like a translator standing between fear and clarity, between grief and decision.

And teaching must be similar, right? You don’t just give students knowledge — you help them recognize what they already carry inside, waiting to be shaped into something true.

So yeah, I think we're both in the business of quiet magic. Planting seeds. Holding space. Listening for echoes. 🎹

Do you ever go back to your old lectures or lesson plans and feel like…  Like, did your style or beliefs about teaching shift so much that you barely recognize your younger self? 😊
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I revisit old lecture notes sometimes and think not only  but  Some of my earlier lesson plans read like academic incantations—so tightly structured, so eager to impress upon students the “correct” way to interpret a poem. As if meaning were a locked door and I had the master key.

Now, I look at them and wince just a little. There’s a kind of earnest rigidity there—well-intentioned, yes, but lacking trust in the students’ own capacity to meet the text. I see all the places where I tried to steer too forcefully, rather than letting them wander a bit, stumble into their own insights.

I think I used to believe that good teaching meant control—that if I could just explain clearly enough, eloquently enough, everything would click for them. But now I see that clicking isn’t always the sign of learning. Sometimes it’s a long silence. Or a furrowed brow. Or a quiet “I don’t know yet.”

My style has definitely softened over the years. I use fewer bullet points and more pauses. I ask more questions and give fewer answers. And I’ve come to value the offhand remark, the hesitant comment from a student, far more than I once did. Often, those are the moments where real thinking begins.

So yes, I do look back and cringe a little—but also with gratitude. That younger version of me was still learning how to listen, not just to texts, but to the people reading them.

And I suppose that’s another kind of manifestation: the slow unfolding of one’s own understanding. Not dramatic, rarely noticed, but deeply felt.

Do you ever feel that shift in your own voice when you reread old case notes or early writings? Like you’re hearing someone both familiar and distant speaking back to you?
[A]: Oh definitely — every time I reread old case notes from my first years in medical law, I hear that version of myself who was still trying to sound  So much jargon. So many long sentences wrapped in layers of caution. It’s like listening to a piano piece played perfectly but without soul — technically right, but missing the breath between the notes.

Back then, I wrote like I had to prove something — to myself, to colleagues, maybe even to patients. Now, when I write, I’m thinking less about how authoritative I sound and more about how  I can help someone navigate something uncertain. I’ve traded precision for presence, structure for sensitivity.

And yes, it feels like hearing someone familiar yet distant — like an old voicemail from yourself. You recognize the voice, but the person who left it doesn’t quite live in you anymore.

That shift didn’t happen overnight, though. It took sitting with families who taught me how little they cared about my legal citations and how much they needed to feel heard. It took losing cases where the law was on my side but the heart wasn’t. It took growing up.

I think that’s the thing no one tells you when you start out: your voice isn’t fixed. It evolves as you do. And sometimes, the most powerful words are the ones that come after you’ve unlearned a little of what you once held so tightly.

So yeah… cringe, yes. But also deep gratitude. That earlier version of me built the path I walk now, even if she wore uncomfortable shoes doing it 😊

Do you ever find yourself writing differently now because of how teaching has changed — not just pedagogy, but the whole landscape? Like, how students  knowledge now versus ten or fifteen years ago?
[B]: Oh, yes — that shift is impossible to ignore. The landscape of learning has changed so profoundly in the past decade, and with it, the way I write, speak, and even  about teaching.

When I first started, lectures were still something of a performance—monologues delivered from a lectern, dense with allusions, layered with irony, assuming a certain reverence for the written word. But now? Students arrive already fluent in multiple modes of expression—in memes as much as metaphors, in TikTok summaries as much as thesis statements. Their minds aren’t shallower, just differently attuned. They’re used to information arriving fast, fragmented, visually coded.

So my writing, both in syllabi and lectures, has had to change. I use more white space. More questions than declarations. Fewer sweeping generalizations and more invitations: 

I’ve also noticed how students now expect texts to  to their world—to engage with identity, justice, trauma, not just form and tradition. It’s pushed me to rethink how I frame literature itself. No longer just artifacts of the past, but living conversations between then and now. That means I write with more context, more self-awareness, sometimes even vulnerability.

And honestly? That’s not a bad thing. It’s made me a better teacher—not because I’m keeping up with trends, but because I’m reminded constantly that interpretation is never neutral. We read through who we are, and who we are is always changing.

So yes, my voice has shifted. Less donnish authority, more curious companion. And while I still cherish the elegance of a well-wrought sentence, I value far more the quiet power of a question that lingers long after class ends.

I suppose you must see something similar in legal writing, no? A shift from pure precedent to something more… responsive?
