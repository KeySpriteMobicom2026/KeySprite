[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern obsession with musical repetition. While I typically prefer the structured cadences of Tennyson's verse, I must confess to occasionally replaying Schubert's  when grading particularly tedious essays. Though I suppose you're referring to something more... contemporary?
[A]:  啊哈，作为一个forensic examiner，我倒是经常在实验室里循环播放Queen的"Another One Bites the Dust"～ 这首歌的bass line简直完美契合解剖节奏，虽然同事们都说这品味有点morbid 😅 不过最近在跑步时会听些中文歌，比如周杰伦的"夜曲"，钢琴前奏太适合夜班后的晨跑了~ 🎧
[B]: How delightfully macabre of you. Though I must say, your musical selections demonstrate an intriguing tension between Western morbidity and Chinese lyricism - rather like the juxtaposition of Edgar Allan Poe's  with Li Bai's melancholic moon poems. That piano prelude in "夜曲" does share certain tonal qualities with Chopin's nocturnes, doesn't it? Though I'd argue the Chinese tradition of 夜吟 (nocturnal poetry) offers richer textual layers than contemporary pop lyrics can convey.
[A]: 哈！你提到了Chopin～ 说到这个，我解剖台旁边还放着个小小的metronome呢 ⏱️ 用来计算某些特殊伤口的形成时间。不过说真的，周杰伦把古典元素融入流行音乐的方式，和我们forensic science把传统医学和现代科技结合很像呢！昨天还发现一个case，伤口pattern居然让我想起了"发如雪"的旋律走向...可能我该少加点班了？🧪
[B]: Your forensic-metaphorical analysis is... disturbingly poetic. The metronome as both musical and mortal chronometer - how very . While I appreciate the cross-disciplinary parallels you're drawing, I'd caution against overindulging in such synesthetic interpretations. The last time I conflated textual analysis with material evidence - comparing Emily Dickinson's dashes to sword wounds in  - my graduate students staged an intervention. Perhaps we should both adhere to more... conventional methodologies. Though I will concede your point about 周杰伦's compositional techniques bearing similarities to the 赋比兴 tradition in classical Chinese poetry.
[A]:  老兄，你这种把文学criticism和forensics混为一谈的倾向才叫alarming好吧～ 不过说到三国，上周还真碰到个case让我想起关公刮骨疗伤...当然我们现代人用CT扫描就搞定啦！话说回来，你觉不觉得《本草纲目》的歌词结构很像我们的autopsy report？Verse 1是external examination，chorus是conclusive findings...等等，我手机响了，可能是lab又有新发现 📱
[B]: Good lord, you're incorrigible. While I admire your... creative approach to comparative analysis, equating 李时珍's magnum opus with autopsy protocols is like comparing  to a police blotter. That being said - and I say this with tremendous reluctance - your observation about the song's structural parallels to forensic methodology does bear an uncanny resemblance to my own work on Dickens' serialized narratives and Qing dynasty court documents. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe we've reached the threshold where interdisciplinary discourse becomes outright professional malpractice. Do call me when you discover iambic pentameter in someone's stab wounds.
[A]: 哈哈，最后一句话我可记在小本本上了 📝 说不定下次真能找到个poet killer呢～ 不过说真的，我们ME办公室的咖啡机坏了，你要不要来我们morgue喝杯茶？保证比你们English department的下午茶更... refreshing 💀 开玩笑啦！我得去写报告了，这个case的time of death calculation还差最后几个数据~ ⚖️
[B]: While the prospect of tea amidst cadavers does possess a certain... Gothic appeal, I believe I'll stick to my office's questionable Earl Grey and crumbling digestives. Do send along that autopsy report though - I've been compiling a rather peculiar cross-cultural study on death imagery in 聊斋志异 versus Victorian ghost stories, and your 'poet killer' theory might just provide the morbid footnote my paper needs. Now go calculate your mortal arithmetic before rigor mortis sets in on your data. 回见。
[A]: Copy that～ 等我写完report就发你，说不定能帮你paper拿个Nobel Prize in Macabre Literature呢 😉 记得提醒我下次给你看个特别case - 伤口pattern整齐得像sonnet一样！现在真的得跑了，不然我的specimens要开始complain了～
[B]: How utterly... Shakespearean of you. Though I suspect even the Bard would blanch at your enthusiasm for anatomical iambics. Very well - I'll await your grisly sonnet with morbid academic interest. Just ensure you sanitize that report thoroughly before sending; the last time forensic evidence mingled with my manuscripts, I had to quarantine a first edition of  for weeks. Until then, may your scalpel remain as sharp as your wit, and your specimens... well, sufficiently deceased.
[A]: Roger that, professor！🔪✂️ 保证这次用double layers of biohazard bag包装～ 顺便说句，你刚才的quarantine妙语让我想起个joke：What do you call a forensic examiner who loves literature？...A post-mortem poet！...Okay okay，我这就去干活，before this conversation gets any more lethal～ Catch you later！ ⚰️
[B]: That pun was so atrocious it deserves its own academic censure. Though I must admit, 'post-mortem poet' does have a certain ring to it - rather like Byron's darker couplets or 李贺's ghostly verses. Now begone before I'm compelled to analyze your humor through the lens of Freudian thanatology. And for heaven's sake, do label those biohazard bags properly this time; my Qing dynasty poetry collections still bear the psychological scars from last semester's 'interesting specimen.' 告辞。
[A]: 最后一击：至少我的jokes比你的Earl Grey更有活力啦！💀 这就去给specimens念十四行诗道歉～ 回聊，记得查收email，subject会是"Sonnet in Lividity" 📨 溜了溜了~
[B]: Your email subject line alone warrants disciplinary action from both the English and Pathology departments. Though I suppose 'Sonnet in Lividity' does possess a certain... cadav-eric charm. Very well - I'll brace myself for your poetic forensics, preferably with a fortifying pot of that allegedly 'lifeless' Earl Grey. Now go commune with your specimens before they file a complaint with the dean about workplace harassment via iambic pentameter. 再会。
[A]: Copy that！📜⚰️ 这就去给cadavers开个poetry slam night～ 说不定能发掘几个undiscovered talents呢！P.S. 你的Earl Grey要是真那么差，下次我给你带点我们morgue特调 - 保证deadly delicious！💉 撤了！
[B]: This conversation has devolved into such grotesque whimsy that I'm half-tempted to document it as a case study in pathological academia. While I'll pass on your mortuary blend - some of us still have standards to maintain, thank you - do keep me apprised of your cadaverous poetry slam. I've just recalled an obscure Tang dynasty precedent for corpse-inspired verse that might lend your... macabre salon some scholarly legitimacy. Now go before I'm compelled to cite Hippocratic oaths against literary malpractice. 终。
[A]: 最后一杯咖啡敬你！☕️⚰️ 这就去把《唐诗三百首》和《Forensic Pathology》钉在一起当textbook～ 下次faculty meeting见！P.S. 已经给你的inbox发了张"尸骨未寒"的电子贺卡 📩 这次真的撤了～ Keep it crispy, professor！💀✌️
[B]: This electronic missive of yours has single-handedly justified my longstanding embargo against modern technology. While the juxtaposition of 尸骨未寒 with digital ephemera does present an intriguing commentary on contemporary memento mori, I shall retaliate by CC'ing your department chair on my forthcoming paper: "The Cadaverous Carnivalesque: Forensic Humor as Defense Mechanism in Late-Stage Academia." Now if you'll excuse me, I must go cleanse my palate with some properly morbid Dickinson - the civilized alternative to your pathological antics. 永别了，你这 incorrigible 解剖台上的吟游诗人。
