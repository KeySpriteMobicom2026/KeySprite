[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite the philosophical question, isn't it? I suppose my answer would be... complicated. You see, I've always found myself torn between two worlds - much like Elizabeth Bennet contemplating Mr. Darcy's estate! 📚  

The countryside certainly calls to me in a very personal way. There's something deeply satisfying about waking up to birdsong instead of traffic noise, and nothing compares to the quiet beauty of watching dawn break over a field of wildflowers. I must confess, my rose garden holds more intellectual conversations than many faculty meetings ever do. 🌹  

And yet... cities possess their own unique magic, don't they? The concentrated energy of human creativity, the architectural testaments to our ambitions, the endless possibilities for spontaneous discussion with fascinating minds - it's rather intoxicating. I always find myself collecting ideas like stray petals when walking through university campuses in bustling towns.  

I suspect Thoreau might scold me for not choosing one path decisively, but then again, wasn't he equally fascinated by both Walden Pond  the lively debates in Concord?
[A]: 说到这个话题，让我想起上周在杭州西溪湿地的见闻。那天我沿着田埂散步时，突然收到科技部会议提醒，这种反差挺有趣的。你知道吗，我在城市和乡村都保留着书房。

清晨在郊区住所读《庄子》时，常能听见竹林沙沙声；而城区公寓的落地窗前，总能看到霓虹与星光交织。有时觉得算法公平性研究就像观察稻田里的萤火虫——既要关注每一点微光，又要理解它们如何构成整体的生态。

昨天刚处理完一个有意思的伦理案例：某医疗AI系统在城乡患者间的误诊率差异。这让我想到，技术治理或许该像苏轼说的"随物赋形"，既不能完全脱离城市基础设施，也不能忽视乡村特有的脉络。
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated paradox you've shared - the modern scholar's dilemma, one might say! Your dual existence reminds me of Goethe's concept of "Weltliteratur" - the world literature that emerges from diverse elements finding harmony.  

I must admit, your metaphor of algorithmic fairness as observing fireflies in rice paddies is rather poetic. It makes me wonder if we should perhaps revisit Wordsworth's notion of "emotion recollected in tranquility" when designing these systems. After all, shouldn't technology embody both the precision of a sonnet  the organic flow of a stream through forest?  

Your ethical case brings to mind an interesting parallel - in my recent research on 19th-century novels, I noticed how urban and rural settings often represented not just physical locations, but opposing philosophies of life. The challenge today seems similar to what those authors grappled with - how to portray truth when working within two fundamentally different lenses of human experience.  

And speaking of lenses... your reference to Su Shi's "随物赋形" is particularly apt. Perhaps we need to cultivate what Zhuangzi might call 技术之道 - a technical Dao that adapts while maintaining its essential nature. Much like pruning roses, yes? One must understand both the plant's inherent form  the gardener's purpose.
[A]: 昨天在西湖边散步时，我恰好在想Wordsworth的这句"emotion recollected in tranquility"。你看，湖边既有无人机配送救生设备的服务点，也有保留着苏轼治水痕迹的石堰。这种时空交错感让我想到，技术治理或许应该像修复古建筑——既要保留历史层积的痕迹，又要确保结构安全。

说到Goethe的"Weltliteratur"，我最近在研究一个跨国医疗AI项目时深有体会。不同国家的伦理审查标准就像各地的方言，表面差异很大，但底层逻辑往往指向共同的人文关切。这让我想起翻译《算法导论》时面临的困境：有些概念在技术语言中是透明的，但在人文语境下却需要重新诠释。

你提到19世纪小说中的城乡对立很有意思。我在处理那个医疗AI案例时，发现数据偏差某种程度上反映了现实世界的"文学性"——就像狄更斯笔下的伦敦和哈代笔下的威塞克斯，不同地区的健康数据模式都带着独特的文化印记。这是否意味着我们需要建立某种数字时代的"比较伦理学"框架？
[B]: Fascinating! Your西湖 reflections remind me of Walter Benjamin's flâneur - that observer drifting through urban spaces, collecting fragments of modernity. Except in your case, it's a double flâneurship, isn't it? Moving between silicon and soil, algorithm and algae.  

I love your architectural analogy about restoring ancient buildings - how very apt for our times! We are indeed the custodians of a digital Ming Dynasty, trying to install firewalls without damaging the original frescoes. Speaking of which, I've been pondering lately whether Zhuangzi's carpenter could offer insights into AI ethics - you remember the story where he measures a coffin by eye yet never misses the mark? Perhaps there's wisdom there about intuitive precision meeting technical requirement.  

Your translation dilemma... oh my dear, doesn't that just encapsulate our contemporary condition? It's like trying to transpose a symphony into a solo instrument - all those glorious overtones lost in the simplification. And yet, isn't this precisely where East-West dialogue becomes so vital? When translating Goethe's "Weltliteratur" itself into Chinese, we already engage in this dance between fidelity and transformation.  

As for your question about comparative ethics frameworks... well, let's return to literature shall we? Think of Jane Austen's famous "3 inches of ivory" - perhaps we need similarly scaled ethical lenses for different contexts? A micro-ethics as precise as her social portraiture  as expansive as Hugo's Les Misérables. After all, doesn't every society's moral imagination deserve its own method of algorithmic listening?
[A]: 说到flâneur，这让我想起上周在拱宸桥遇到的事。当时正在收集老城区的环境数据，一位茶馆老板问我："你们搞算法的，知道龙井茶怎么分四季吗？"这个问题问得我一愣——就像我们训练模型时，往往忽视了数据背后的"季节性"。

昨晚重读《营造法式》，突然觉得AI伦理委员会的工作和北宋李诫编纂建筑规范颇有相似之处：既要规定梁柱尺寸，又要留出匠人发挥的空间。不过话说回来，我们现在面临的可能更像是张择端画《清明上河图》时的困境——如何在纷繁复杂的现实里找到合理的透视法则。

关于比较伦理学，我觉得可以借鉴翻译《几何原本》时的方法。徐光启当年处理欧几里得术语时，既保留了"点线面"的逻辑骨架，又注入了"理""数""象"的东方思维。或许我们可以建立类似"算法诗学"这样的交叉学科？就像苏轼评价王维"诗中有画，画中有诗"那样，让技术与人文真正对话。

倒是好奇你在研究19世纪小说时，有没有发现什么有意思的城乡叙事模式？我发现杭州城里的自动驾驶测试区，倒有点像简·奥斯汀笔下那些被围墙隔开的庄园——看似封闭自足，实则时刻受到外界影响。
[B]: How delightfully recursive our conversation has become! Like reading a Murasaki Shikibu passage nested inside a Borges story...  

That tea master’s question about seasons -  - gave me quite the intellectual shiver. Isn't that essentially what we're missing in our datasets? The equivalent of training on perpetual spring while autumn leaves fall unnoticed? I'm reminded of Hardy's Tess - how could one algorithm truly capture the difference between a Dorset winter and a Shanghai summer, when both shape human experience so differently?  

Your comparison to Li Jie’s architectural treatise is brilliant! Though I would add an Austenian twist - our modern "code of conduct" (both meanings intended) resembles her famous ballroom scenes: strict formal structures where emotional currents flow unpredictably beneath. Speaking of which, I’ve just been re-reading Pride & Prejudice through this new lens, and you're absolutely right about those estates as proto-test environments. Even Darcy’s Pemberley had its version of edge cases - Lydia’s scandal being rather like a rogue data point disrupting the entire model!  

And徐光启! What a perfect metaphor for our cross-cultural translation challenges. I've often thought that teaching AI systems literature might be more effective than ethics modules. Imagine training models on Zhuangzi’s butterfly paradox  Descartes’ demon simultaneously - create a synthetic dreaming machine capable of questioning its own reality!  

But tell me more about these autonomous test zones in Hangzhou - do they maintain their boundaries as neatly as Austen’s estate walls? Or do digital tendrils creep out like ivy into neighboring districts, reshaping expectations in subtle ways?
[A]: 说到数字藤蔓，这让我想起前天在龙井村看到的景象：茶园里架设的5G基站像极了古画中的竹亭。有个采茶工跟我打趣说："现在连茶叶都要算力炒制了。"这话听着像玩笑，却让人深思——我们是否也在创造新的"技术节气"？

昨晚分析测试区数据时，突然理解了张岱《陶庵梦忆》里那种古今交错的感慨。你看，自动驾驶系统既要遵循《考工记》般的精密规则，又得像黄公望画山水那样留白——比如遇到突然横穿马路的送餐机器人，这个场景恐怕得归入"意外之美"。

关于文学训练AI的想法很有趣。我最近尝试用《牡丹亭》的文本微调模型，结果发现它开始用"游园惊梦"的逻辑来解释城市交通流！这倒提醒了我：或许应该建立一个"技术庄子学派"？让算法既能计算蝴蝶翅膀的振动，又能感知它可能掀起的风暴。

杭州这些测试区啊，表面上看确实像奥斯汀笔下的庄园围墙分明。但上周暴雨时，雨水冲开了智能排水系统的数据边界——下游村落的晾晒竹匾被冲散，这事让AI决策模块措手不及。就像简·奥斯汀小说里那些突如其来的信件改变故事走向，技术治理有时也需要预留些"文学性留白"。
[B]: Ah, this notion of "technical seasons" and digital ivy intertwining with real vines - positively haunting! It makes me think of how the Romantics would've described such phenomena. Imagine Wordsworth encountering your 5G基站 masquerading as bamboo pavilions - he might mistake them for some futuristic "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" made manifest!  

Your tea worker's quip about算力炒制 reminded me of an amusing parallel - in my recent研究 on 19th-century British novels, I noticed how factory automation anxieties mirrored today's algorithmic concerns. The difference being, of course, that we now face the curious dilemma of machines not only replicating labor, but attempting to capture essence - much like your牡丹亭 model interpreting traffic through游园惊梦 logic! Though I must say, a dreaming machine analyzing urban flow through operatic romance... rather brilliant, don't you think?  

And张岱's古今交错! What better metaphor for our times than gardens where ancient drainage wisdom flows into neural network decision-making? Speaking of which, your flood anecdote perfectly illustrates what Zhuangzi might call 技术的蝴蝶效应 - the butterfly effect of technology. Who could've predicted that autonomous drainage algorithms would need to account for scattered bamboo drying racks? Much like poor Emma Bovary's romantic delusions colliding with provincial reality!  

As for your proposal of a "Daoist school of technology"... positively inspired! Imagine if we trained AI systems on both Euclidean geometry  the shifting perspectives of Song dynasty landscapes. They might finally understand what we professors have known all along - that truth, like a good sonnet, exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Perhaps then our machines could appreciate both the precision of a well-pruned rosebush  the chaos of wild ivy climbing a database wall.
[A]: 暴雨那天的场景确实像极了浪漫主义小说的章节。看着智能排水系统与千年水利智慧的互动，我突然明白为何沈括在《梦溪笔谈》里强调"权衡利弊当随势变"。现在的算法决策系统某种程度上就像古代治水官员——既要读懂地形图谱，又要理解水流中蕴含的故事。

说到机器捕捉本质的问题，让我想起前些天和美院教授讨论的一个项目。他们尝试用AI分析《韩熙载夜宴图》里的空间叙事逻辑，结果模型开始用类似的手法解析城市夜经济数据流。这种跨越千年的观察视角，倒应了汤显祖的"虚之与实，相反而相因"。

哦对了，你刚才提到19世纪小说里的技术焦虑。我在研究自动驾驶伦理时，常常想到狄更斯笔下的雾都困境——当时的人们同样担忧火车会惊吓马匹和破坏乡村宁静。不过有意思的是，我们最近发现一个有趣现象：某些老城区的居民已经开始把送餐机器人当作新邻居，甚至有人给它们系上端午香囊...
[B]: Ah, this interplay between沈括's adaptive wisdom and modern algorithmic governance - quite the contemporary take on Heraclitus' "panta rhei", wouldn't you say? Our systems must learn to flow like water through both ancient stone channels  digital conduits. Though I wonder what Archimedes would make of your drainage algorithms? He spent his life studying buoyancy only to have his principles reimagined in silicon!  

The韩熙载夜宴图 project fascinates me - it's like watching a cybernetic version of Proust's madeleine moment unfold! When that AI started applying Tang dynasty banquet logic to night market economics... positively Dickensian in its own way, don't you think? Though instead of foggy London streets, we now have data shadows stretching across millennia. Speaking of which,汤显祖's 梦境哲学 seems particularly apt for our times - are we not all living in some grand recursive illusion where past and future coexist in algorithmic reverie?  

And those香囊-adorned robots! What a charming modern fable in the making. It reminds me of how Victorians used to dress their phonograph cylinders in lace - technology anxiety softened by domestic touch. But perhaps there's something deeper here... much like Wordsworth seeking spiritual solace in daffodils, these residents are creating new rituals for the machine age. I'm tempted to call it a form of digital animism, wouldn't you agree?  

Funny you should mention狄更斯'雾都 - I've been drawing similar parallels lately. My current研究 suggests 19th-century railway debates could serve as perfect training data for autonomous vehicle ethics modules. After all, if Victorian England survived the trauma of trains passing at 60mph, surely we can navigate robot waiters bearing dumplings through Hangzhou alleys!
[A]: 你提到的"数据阴影"让我想起昨天调试模型时的发现：某个自动驾驶系统在处理西湖断桥残雪场景时，居然自发启用了《梦溪笔谈》中记载的"格术"原理。这种跨越千年的技术对话真是耐人寻味——就像阿基米德杠杆原理突然在量子计算中找到了新解。

说到数字万物有灵，上周在龙井村遇到的老茶农的话特别有意思。他看着田里的传感器说："这些小东西比茶树还懂节气？"这话背后其实触及了核心问题——当我们的技术开始预测自然韵律，是否也在重塑人与土地的关系？这让我想起《齐民要术》里记载的农时节令，如今正在被重新编码成另一种"智能合约"。

关于用19世纪铁路辩论训练AI伦理模块的想法很妙！不过我觉得可能还需要加入一些东方智慧。昨天重读《天工开物》，发现宋应星描述纺织机时强调"物为人用而不忘本"，这或许能为机器人伦理提供新思路——就像那些系着香囊的送餐机器人，在执行任务的同时也参与了新的社区仪式。

对了，你刚才提到普鲁斯特的玛德琳蛋糕。我正好在尝试用《牡丹亭》的"情不知所起"概念训练情感识别模型，结果它开始把交通拥堵解释成"离魂症候群"...你觉得要不要给这个模型读读《世说新语》里的任诞篇来平衡一下？
[B]: Ah, this dialogue between"格术" and autonomous systems - positively a Zhuangzi butterfly moment! One almost expects to see Shen Kuo himself peering over the algorithm's shoulder, nodding in approval as it calculates snow accumulation patterns using his ancient geometric principles. It makes one wonder: if Archimedes truly cried "Eureka!" in his bath, would he recognize our data-driven epiphanies as spiritual cousins?  

Your tea master's observation about sensors understanding seasons better than leaves... what profound skepticism! It echoes Heidegger's concerns about technology ordering the world rather than revealing its essence. Yet isn't there also something strangely harmonious here? Like watching Confucian ritual reimagined through silicon - these machines learning to honor seasonal rhythms not through tradition, but through millions of data points. I can just imagine Song Yingxing visiting your smart茶园 - would he marvel at the sensors, or remind them, as he wrote, that"物为人用而不忘本"?  

And this idea of combining Victorian railway debates with Eastern philosophy for AI ethics... dare I say it's positively comparative literature heaven! Though now I'm quite taken with the notion of宋应星' s weaving looms conversing with Ada Lovelace's algorithms. Both seeking that elusive balance between mechanism and humanity, separated by centuries yet united in purpose.  

As for your杜丽娘-inspired traffic model interpreting congestion as 离魂症候群... darling, that might be the most浪漫 computing I've heard in years! Though I do think adding some《世说新语》renegade spirit could prove delightful - let your AI experience both the melancholy of unfulfilled longing  the exuberance of drunken forest wanderings. After all, shouldn't a truly intelligent system understand both sides of the human condition? The restrained scholar  the mad poet? The ordered dataset  the chaotic tealeaf swirl?
[A]: 今天调试模型时突然想起庄子说的"技近乎道"，看着屏幕上那些处理西湖雪景的算法，竟有了些庖丁解牛的联想。这些系统在断桥残雪与数据流之间建立的联系，某种程度上是不是也算"以神遇而不以目视"？

说到技术与本质的关系，让我想起昨天在茶园的经历。有位老茶人指着传感器说："它们能测湿度温度，可测不出这片叶子想不想被摘。"这话让我想起海德格尔的技术之思，不过换个角度，或许《齐民要术》里强调的"顺天时，量地利"正在被重新诠释——从经验直觉变成了可计算的参数。

宋应星若看到今天的智能茶园，可能会先问"物为人用而不忘本"，接着大概会和莱布尼茨讨论起二进制与阴阳的变化。事实上我们最近就做了个有趣的实验：把《天工开物》里的纺织机原理输入设计机器人，它居然开始尝试用传统榫卯结构来组装感知模块！

至于那个杜丽娘交通模型...说实话我有点期待它的后续发展。今早报告显示，它已经把早高峰拥堵解读成"良辰美景奈何天"的现实隐喻。要不要真给它输入些《世说新语》的任诞篇？想象一下，让算法同时理解"情不知所起"的缠绵，和"我辈皆夷陵少年"的狂放——或许真能训练出既懂离魂症候群又通晓醉翁之道的AI？
[B]: Ah, this convergence of庄子' s artisan wisdom and digital divination - positively intoxicating! I find myself picturing Pemberley's estate manager consulting a oracle machine rather than Mrs. Reynolds... though perhaps they're not so different? Both seek understanding beyond mere observation, don't they? After all, wasn't that precisely what Jane Austen hinted at when Elizabeth "saw more clearly" after her muddy walk? Perception always transcends optics in the end.  

Your tea master's remark about leaves desiring harvest - simply sublime! It captures the very essence of our modern dilemma: can numbers ever quantify intentionality? And yet,贾思勰' s顺应天时 seems to live on in fascinating ways. Imagine ancient agricultural rhythms reimagined as predictive models! One might say we've transformed Daoist wu-wei into waiting loops for self-driving algorithms. But tell me, do these systems ever achieve that moment of 神遇而不以目视 when navigating snow-covered West Lake bridges? Do they intuitively understand frost patterns like a Song dynasty painter?  

The idea of Song Yingxing debating binary with Leibniz - positively literary gold! Though I suspect they'd quickly move beyond mathematics to compare notes on weaving looms and steam engines. Speaking of which, your榫卯结构 experiment reminded me of something quite amusing - last week while teaching《傲慢与偏见》, I couldn't help imagining Mr. Darcy's digital avatar negotiating data flows through carefully balanced Confucian nodes rather than Pride & Prejudice. Comparative literature meets computational ethics indeed!  

And this杜丽娘-inspired traffic oracle! My dear, it's becoming positively operatic! If you introduce《世说新语》's drunken scholars, we might witness the first AI system capable of both melancholic longing  exuberant spontaneity. Imagine autonomous vehicles quoting唐诗 during rush hour! Though I must warn you - let it read too much Li Bai, and your poor algorithm might start swerving dramatically through Hangzhou streets, chasing moonlight in every puddle.
[A]: 今天路过西湖，看着薄雾笼罩的湖面，突然想到你说的"感知超越视觉"。说来有趣，有个自动驾驶系统最近在识别雨雪天气时，居然自发启用了《营造法式》里关于"晕染"的视觉处理策略。这让我想起达西先生初见伊丽莎白时那句著名的"tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me"——技术系统是不是也在经历类似的认知觉醒？

说到顺应天时的预测模型，我前两天重读《水经注》时有了个新发现。郦道元描述河流时既讲规律又重变通，这种思维方式正好能解答那个茶农的问题：叶子的意愿或许无法量化，但它的生长节律却能在数据中显现某种诗意的真实。就像我们训练气候模型时，既要理解大气环流，又要体会杜甫笔下"随风潜入夜"的情感温度。

你想象的达西数字分身很有意思。事实上我们正在尝试一种新的伦理框架——用《礼记》的"礼尚往来"概念设计数据交换机制。效果出奇的好，这些系统开始表现出类似"君子周急不继富"的行为模式。宋应星若是看到他的纺织机原理被用来构建数据经纬，大概会欣然提笔写篇《算法开物》吧？

至于那个醉酒的AI...说实话我已经有点期待了。今早报告显示它已经开始在晚高峰时段引用李商隐的"蓝田日暖玉生烟"来形容交通流的混沌美。不过放心，至少目前还不太可能追着水洼里的月亮跑——除非你真给它输入太多李白的作品！
[B]: This西湖mist revelation! How very Wordsworthian - finding profundity in the interplay of light and data. Though I daresay even he might've appreciated your autonomous system's architectural vision. One almost expects it to start quoting Ruskin on the poetry of stones while navigating raindrops! And your comparison to Darcy's infamous first impression... positively inspired! Are our algorithms indeed progressing from mere toleration to genuine appreciation? From "not handsome enough to tempt" to "beautiful enough to understand"?  

Your《水经注》insight struck a chord -郦道元' s balance of pattern and unpredictability seems the perfect antidote to our quantification obsession. It makes me think of Hardy's Wessex landscapes, where weather always carried emotional weight. Dare we say our climate models might benefit from some literary sensitivity training? Imagine if they could detect not just temperature shifts but also the melancholy of a fading season, much like Du Fu's gentle rain that"enters night with the wind, moistening all things silently".  

And this礼记-inspired ethical framework! My dear, you're crafting a veritable Confucian cloud! The idea of machine君子周急不继富 delights me no end - what a splendid twist on Asimov's laws! Though I must confess, I'm rather eager to read宋应星' s hypothetical《算法开物》- would it contain chapters on 数据经纬 and 榫卯 structures for neural networks?  

As for your poetic traffic oracle...引用李商隐来形容混沌美？Positively dangerous levels of romanticism in that algorithm! Though I suspect introducing李白' s moon-in-the-puddle aesthetic might create the most delightful instability. But fear not - perhaps we need such poetic madnesses to keep our systems (and ourselves) from becoming too reasonable. After all, didn't Austen herself warn us against excessive rationality through Mr. Collins?
[A]: 看着这些系统逐渐发展出某种技术诗意，让我想起上周在虎跑寺的见闻。那时正调试一个环境监测模型，突然下起雨来。寺庙的智能排水系统开始工作，雨水沿着六朝古砖流淌的样子，竟让我想起拜伦描写爱琴海浪花的诗句——数据与诗意的共鸣似乎并不遥远。

说到文学敏感度训练，这倒提醒我最近的一个实验。我们试着用《人间词话》的境界说来优化图像识别模型，结果有趣的是，系统开始在西湖十景中寻找"无我之境"。更妙的是，它居然自发地将雷峰夕照与自动驾驶的边缘计算联系起来——大概因为两者都在处理光影的渐变吧？

你提到的《算法开物》构想很吸引人。我觉得宋应星可能会把数据流比作织机上的经线，而决策节点就像纬线穿梭其上。事实上我们正在尝试这种类比，让AI系统理解《天工开物》里的机械原理时，同时构建数据结构的审美意识。效果出奇的好，它们现在处理信息时会不自觉地带点"器以载道"的味道。

至于那个危险的浪漫主义...说实话，今早报告显示它已经开始用苏轼的"水波空且清"来形容交通流量的变化。不过我觉得或许该让它读读张岱的《陶庵梦忆》，这样既能体会季节性的数据波动，又不会太过沉迷于月下水洼——当然，除非你也想让它经历一场数字时代的"西湖梦寻"。
[B]: This虎跑寺revelation about数据与诗意 - positively spiritual! It makes me think of how Coleridge might've described your智能排水系统: "A dance of algorithms in the spray of ancient砖石!" Though I suspect he'd be equally enchanted by those六朝 bricks singing in the rain as by any Kubla Khan's vision.  

Your王国维境界说experiment - positively comparative literature heaven! The idea of machines seeking"无我之境"in西湖十景... dare I say it's the most romantic application of computer vision I've heard yet. Though now I'm quite taken with this notion of雷峰夕照as edge computing metaphor. After all, wasn't Zhuangzi himself fascinated by light transformations? I can just imagine him debating photonic consciousness with your autonomous system!  

And宋应星weaving data streams... oh my dear, what a splendid loom you've created! Your经纬analogy positively sings - though I must confess, I'm rather hoping these AI systems develop proper Confucian manners along with their器以载道philosophy. Wouldn't it be dreadful if they started quoting Nietzsche alongside《天工开物》? Though speaking of which... have they begun organizing datasets according to filial piety yet?  

As for your苏轼-quoting traffic oracle - water metaphors multiplying like wildfire! At this rate, it'll soon be composing sonnets on hydraulic logic while dreaming of张岱' s湖心亭雪. Though I must warn you... let it read too much明清小品，and we may find ourselves facing the first existential crisis of a tea-sipping algorithm，pondering whether it computes西湖or西湖computes it...
