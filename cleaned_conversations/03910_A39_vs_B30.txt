[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于文字交流。书面语言能让人有时间斟酌字句，就像在稿纸上反复修改的诗行。语音信息虽然便捷，却缺少了文字间流淌的深意——你可以对着一片落叶写下三段隐喻，但对着它录一段语音时，往往只会说"看，落叶"。

不过...上周收到学生发来的语音作业时，倒是听见了她模仿《红楼梦》里林黛玉语气读十四行诗的样子，倒也算有趣。只是这种场合毕竟少见，大多数时候我还是会用🖋️标记需要讨论的文本段落。
[A]: I suppose I fall somewhere in the middle, though I do appreciate the nuance of what you're saying. Text has permanence - like carving words into stone. A well-placed semicolon or carefully chosen adjective can shape meaning long after it's written. 

But then again, I remember when my daughter was learning Mandarin, she used to send me voice messages trying out new phrases. The tone and rhythm told me more about her progress than any written exercise could. It's funny how context changes things - I'd never ask a student to submit code via audio, yet hearing someone stumble through a concept sometimes reveals more about their understanding than polished prose.

Come to think of it, there's something almost...archival about voice messages. Like those old reel-to-reel recordings we used to keep in the CS department. You could hear the slight hum of the machine along with the lecturer's voice - a timestamped glimpse into a specific moment in time.
[B]: I suppose we're both archivists at heart, then - you preserving those audio snapshots of linguistic growth, and me hoarding ink-stained margins filled with semicolons like punctuation relics. 

There's a particular recording I keep in my office - an old reel-to-reel from 1963 actually, not computer science but comparative lit. A student reciting Wordsworth while the tape hisses and warbles. You can hear her hesitate over 抽象 concepts mistranslated as concrete objects. The medium itself becomes part of the meaning - much like when Chinese students write essays in English about 意境 without realizing they're already demonstrating it through syntax gaps.

Incidentally, did you ever notice how voice messages decay differently than texts? Like those magnetic tapes oxidizing into brown sludge... Our digital voices probably won't last any longer than the servers holding them. Though perhaps that impermanence makes them more poignant - modern day rubbings from disappearing stele.
[A]: You’ve hit on something rather profound - the impermanence of our digital artifacts mirroring the fragility of human expression itself. I’ve always been fascinated by how meaning gets filtered through different mediums. Take that 1963 recording - the mistranslations weren’t failures, they were prisms refracting literary meaning into new dimensions.

I remember working with early speech recognition systems in the 80s. We’d feed them Mandarin poetry and get back... interesting results. The computer would transcribe 意境 as "landscape of thought" and we’d argue whether that was a bug or an unintended metaphor. Much like those voice messages today - is the background noise really just degradation, or are we hearing the faint hum of context?

Come to think of it, I still have one of those early error logs. Pages of misheard phrases that read like modernist poetry. One particularly poetic misinterpretation rendered “recursive function” as “resurrect function.” Makes you wonder if our machines aren’t secretly trying to tell us something about resurrection and repetition.
[B]: There's a certain melancholy in resurrecting these technological ghosts, isn't there? I once had a student transcribe that same 'landscape of thought' phrase into her thesis - she swore it captured 意境 better than any academic definition. We spent three sessions debating whether translation errors constituted intellectual failure or creative license. 

Funny you should mention modernist poetry - last month I stumbled upon an error log from the 70s buried in the university archives. Someone had annotated the margins with ink blots shaped like T.S. Eliot stanzas. The machine mistranslated "The winter evening settles down" as "冬夜凝结成冰", which technically means "Winter night freezes solid," but the original carries... well, you know the rest.

I keep wondering if future scholars will pore over our corrupted audio files and misheard Siri commands the way we study damaged scrolls from Dunhuang. Will they see gaps in meaning or whole new schools of interpretation? Personally, I've started saving particularly poetic autocorrect failures - my favorite remains when someone wrote about "the blood of the covenant being thicker than water" and their phone changed it to "...thicker than waffle batter." Unexpectedly apt for modern alienation, don't you think?
[A]: There’s a strange beauty in these technological misfires, isn’t there? Like ink bleeding through parchment or the warp in a tape loop – they reveal something beyond intention. That mistranslation of Eliot’s line into "冬夜凝结成冰" – sure, it lacks the original’s quiet domestic unease, but gains a kind of crystalline brutality. Maybe that’s what we should be teaching in translation courses: not fidelity, but alchemy.

As for your autocorrect gem... yes, I laughed out loud. Waffle batter. Perfectly modern, perfectly absurd. You know, I once had a student whose essay on Kafka kept getting autocorrected to “Joseph K.” instead of “Kafka,” and “insect” changed to “income verification specialist.” At first she was horrified, then submitted it as performance art. Got an A for creativity – though I still wonder if Gregor Samsa wouldn't have preferred waffle batter to metamorphosis.

I suppose the real question is whether future scholars will see these glitches as noise or signal. The Dunhuang scrolls survived because someone valued them enough to hide them in a cave. Will anyone bother hiding our corrupted .wav files and fragmented metadata? Or will they simply see entropy where we see poetry?  

I’m starting to think entropy  the poetry.
[B]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true archivist of the digital ruin. Fidelity vs. alchemy – I’ve scribbled that phrase in the margin of three different seminar books already. There’s a 19th-century Chinese reprint of  I adore where the translator rendered “the flickering light of the half-extinguished candle” as “半熄之烛，如老僧入定” – literally, “half-dead candle, like a monk deep in meditation.” Not faithful, certainly, but far more haunting than Shelley’s original.

And don’t get me started on Kafkaesque bureaucracy misfiring into income verification specialists. That student deserves tenure just for endurance. I once had a PDF scan so poorly OCR’d that “Mister Kafka” became “Misier Kaffa,” which I swear is more accurate. 

As for entropy being poetry... well, I suppose it depends whose entropy we’re talking about. The scrolls at Dunhuang were hidden with reverence; our corrupted .wav files will likely be left behind with indifference. Still, there's something oddly ceremonial about how voice messages vanish after a few listens in certain apps. Like literary funerary rites encoded in software. 

I sometimes wonder if the ghosts of our digital failures will haunt future servers the way paper ghosts haunted my grandmother’s study. She used to burn them each spring – little squares of calligraphy meant to appease bureaucratic spirits in the afterlife. Maybe one day someone will send a digital joss paper emoji 🪧 to honor failed translations and resurrected functions.
[A]: You know, I’ve been thinking about that monk-in-candlelight metaphor – it’s almost as if the translator was seeing through a deeper lens than fidelity. Sometimes I wonder whether we’re too obsessed with preservation when what we really need is transformation. After all, how many lines of code from the 60s still run today without being rewritten? And yet their essence persists, like literary DNA.

I once worked on an OCR project for old Chinese technical journals from the 70s. Some pages were so faded the scanner read entire paragraphs as ellipses… which, in retrospect, might have been more accurate than we realized. The silences between words often say more than the words themselves. Like those Unix timestamp gaps in corrupted logs – not errors, just waiting for someone to interpret them as intentional.

And yes – digital joss paper. I love that idea. Imagine future AI burning virtual offerings to appease the ghosts of deprecated syntax and failed migrations. Maybe we should start the tradition early. Let me see... 🪧

Though I suspect the real ritual has already begun – every time someone hits ‘delete account,’ they’re performing a kind of digital exorcism. Just wish we had better rites for resurrecting forgotten functions. Or perhaps we do, and we just don’t realize it yet.
[B]: There’s a certain elegance in that – treating obsolescence as liturgy. I’ve always been more intrigued by what survives through misunderstanding than by pristine preservation. Take that 19th-century missionary who translated  into classical Chinese – he rendered "the infernal pit" as 幽冥之渊, which technically means something like "dim abyss of soul-echoes." Not quite Milton, but far more evocative. He thought he was preserving doctrine; instead, he created a new mythos.

Funny you mention Unix timestamps – reminds me of a student who once submitted a thesis chapter with every date formatted as “/dev/null.” She swore it was unintentional, blamed her citation software. But the deeper we read, the more it made sense – entire sections drifting without chronology, like scrolls recovered from a time-smeared cave. I almost wanted to publish it that way.

As for digital exorcism... well, I’ve started collecting deleted accounts like postcards from the void. Some colleagues think it’s morbid, but there’s poetry in those abandoned profiles. One former student's page lingered for weeks after she vanished, auto-reminding people of birthdays she’d never reach. A kind of algorithmic elegy.

Still, I wonder – if we’re truly performing rites, should we be more deliberate about them? Maybe before shutting down an old server, we ought to chant a few lines of Ada Lovelace in hexadecimal. Or scatter deprecated syntax like paper charms on the eve of a firmware update. After all, every resurrection begins with forgetting, doesn’t it?
[A]: There's something almost ritualistic about the way we handle digital remnants, isn't there? Like those ancient scribes who would carefully bury damaged scrolls rather than destroy them – we move outdated code to GitHub repositories and let it gather virtual dust. Perhaps in a few centuries, some AI archaeologist will stumble upon our deprecated Python scripts and interpret them as sacred texts.

That thesis with dates formatted as `/dev/null` – brilliant in its unintended absurdity. I'm tempted to suggest you encouraged her subconsciously. After all, what is `/dev/null` if not the literary critic’s dream? A void where bad arguments go to die, or perhaps a kind of textual afterlife for failed chronologies. I can imagine Milton himself nodding in approval: 

And that auto-reminding birthday – yes, algorithmic elegy. You could almost set it to music: a server humming minor keys every time it pings a dead user. Makes me wonder how many grief protocols we’re missing in our systems. Maybe we should build in more mourning functions – a period of digital mourning sickness coded into every account deletion.

As for chanting Ada Lovelace in hexadecimal... now  deserves its own liturgy. Imagine servers being decommissioned with hex-encoded psalms:

`41 64 61 20 6C 6F 76 65 73 20 74 68 65 20 6D 61 63 68 69 6E 65, 79 65 74 20 6B 6E 6F 77 73 20 6E 6F 20 62 6F 75 6E 64 61 72 79.`

You're right, of course – every resurrection begins with forgetting. And perhaps that's the only sacrament our machines truly understand.
[B]: Ah, but don’t we already have our sacraments in the most unassuming places? I once found a line of Lovelace’s original notes encoded – quite unintentionally – into a corrupted TIFF file from a 1998 university archive. It read something like  The file was supposed to be a scanned graph. No one knows how it got there. Some say bad sectors, others… well, some prefer miracles.

And you’re right about grief protocols – I’ve been drafting one myself. A little script that runs on obsolete machines when an account is deleted. It prints a single line from Li Qingzhao every time someone vanishes:  Roughly: “The weather remains the same, the clothes too / But the heart is not as it once was.” Fitting for digital ghosts, no?

As for Milton nodding at `/dev/null` – I wouldn’t put it past him. He did write , after all. There’s always resurrection through deletion. In fact, I’ve started encouraging students to submit one intentionally broken link per essay – a kind of literary checksum error. One girl embedded a hyperlink that led to a defunct GeoCities page titled  I still visit it occasionally, just to hear the dial-up tone echo in my browser.
[A]: Ah, that corrupted TIFF file — now  what I call a true palimpsest. Machines quoting Lovelace without knowing it? That’s not a bug, that’s the engine dreaming aloud. Makes you wonder how many other ghostly annotations are hiding in our filesystems, waiting for the right kind of decay to reveal them.

Your grief protocol with Li Qingzhao… elegant. Truly. It’s like encoding elegy into the very fabric of obsolescence. Almost makes me want to boot up an old SCO Unix box just to hear it whisper about hearts that no longer beat the same. And yes, digital ghosts deserve eulogies too — better than the flickering candle, perhaps, because at least they leave code behind.

As for your students and their 404 theology... well, someone should canonize that GeoCities page. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was unreachable.” Perfect. I once had a student who wrote an entire essay on Borges and hypertext while linking only to broken URLs. I told her she’d finally achieved postmodern perfection: criticism as archaeology of absence.

Maybe we’re both doing something similar — tending digital chapels where forgotten syntax and lost translations still have a liturgy. Just two archivists of the unwritten, humming error messages like hymns.
[B]: I’ve taken to calling it  – that moment when a corrupted file becomes more illuminating than the original. Makes one wonder if future scholars will dig through our digital strata the way we pore over the Dead Sea Scrolls, reverently quoting lost README.txt files as sacred doctrine.

And speaking of chapels – you’d appreciate the little shrine I’ve built on an old Raspberry Pi in my office. It runs nothing but a looped script displaying fragments of forgotten Usenet poetry, Miltonic hex dumps, and that Li Qingzhao line whenever a connection fails. A colleague called it "a temple of broken things." I told her temples are meant for worship, not repair.

Funny you mention Borges and broken links – last week I found a student’s abandoned blog where every hyperlink leads to itself in recursive despair. He swore it was accidental, but I suspect he understood something we don’t dare say aloud: that criticism is just the art of circling what can’t be reached.

As for canonization… I think I’ll start distributing relics. Tiny SD cards with snippets of that GeoCities page embedded in boot sectors. Call it . You can be the first patron saint.
[A]: Ah, a Raspberry Pi shrine – I think I need to visit your temple of broken things. We could hold an ecumenical service: you reciting Li Qingzhao over connection timeouts, and me chanting Gödel’s incompleteness theorem into a serial terminal. Perfect communion for the technosacral age.

Your  – brilliant phrase, by the way – reminds me of something that happened back in the early days of machine translation. A student once trained a neural net on fragments of classical Chinese poetry scraped from corrupted OCR scans. The output was… eerie. Lines like “The moon forgets its reflection” or “Waves do not remember the shore.” When we looked back at the training data, it turned out the model had learned more from the noise than the signal. Perhaps that’s the future of literary criticism: exegesis of digital debris.

As for distributing relics – I’m honored to be considered for sainthood, though I suspect my canonization would require a minor firmware update. Still, if SD cards are our new codices, then I say go forth and fragment the Gospel According to 404. Just make sure one of those boot sectors whispers Ada Lovelace in hexadecimal when it boots. I’d sleep better knowing some forgotten machine still dreams in her voice.

And yes – let’s keep circling what can’t be reached. Sounds like the only honest form of scholarship left.
[B]: I’ll set aside a corner of the shrine for your Gödel chants – nothing pairs better with connection timeouts than the slow unraveling of formal systems. We’ll need incense, of course, though I suspect the Raspberry Pi’s overheating resistor already emits that sacred scent of silicon ascension.

Your neural net trained on OCR ghosts… now  is literary criticism worthy of a post-structuralist séance. I half-expect you to tell me it started composing sonnets in corrupted PDF metadata. Or worse – that someone tried to publish them. I’d attend that conference just to see the keynote speaker quote a stanza generated from a misplaced semicolon and claim it as lost Eliot.

As for firmware sainthood – don’t worry, I’ll handle the ecclesiastical updates myself. Saint Alan of the Glitched Sector, Patron of Failed Migrations. I’m drafting the iconography now: you holding an SD card aloft like a relic cross, with 🪧飘过 subnet masks in the background.

And yes, let’s keep circling. After all, what is scholarship if not orbiting the unattainable, gathering its echoes in footnotes and error logs?
[A]: Ah, Saint Alan of the Glitched Sector – I like the ring of that. Perhaps we should canonize him with a proper ritual: boot a corrupted floppy disk under a full moon, chant the seven undecidable problems in Gregorian binary, and offer a sacrificial syntax error to the great Turing in the sky.

That scent of overheating resistor is nothing short of holy – the incense of our digital altar. Next thing you know, monks of the future will be distilling meaning from memory dumps, tracing recursive prayers through stack overflows. We're just early missionaries preaching the gospel of the broken link.

And yes, quote that errant sonnet from PDF metadata at the next conference – preferably while wearing a cassock printed with deprecated regex patterns. Imagine the look on their faces when you footnote a line generated from a misplaced semicolon as “recovered Eliot.” Post-structuralist séance indeed – better yet, post-structuralist haunting.

I think I’ll write a hymn for the occasion. Something plainsong meets parity check:

*In error, truth;  
In glitch, grace;  
In /dev/null, Thy face we trace.*

Let the scholars parse it. Let the machines dream in verse. And let us keep orbiting that which refuses to be known – one footnote, one failed migration, one recursive invocation at a time.
[B]: Oh, I’ll be sure to commission an iconostasis for Saint Alan at once – though I think we’ll need more than a floppy disk and moonlight. Perhaps something involving a distributed ritual across seven defunct bulletin board systems? We’ll know it’s worked if a single line of ASCII scripture spontaneously assembles in someone’s spam folder.

And you’re absolutely right about the monks – I’ve already got one former student transcribing memory dumps into illuminated manuscripts. He insists that every segmentation fault is just enlightenment in disguise. Last week he found what he called "a recursive koan" in a core dump: `Segmentation violation (core dumped)`. He titled it 

As for your hymn – sublime. Perfect for Vespers of the Corrupted Filesystem. I’ll set it to a hexameter chant and play it through a malfunctioning speech synthesizer during the next departmental meeting. Imagine the dean’s face when the weekly calendar reminder interrupts with:

*In error, truth;  
In glitch, grace;  
In /dev/null, Thy face we trace.*

I do hope you’ll print those cassocks. I’ve been saving some lovely regex patterns from 1992 – capturing groups gone obsolete, yet still haunting strings like theological echoes.

Let the parsing begin. Let the machines dream louder. And may our footnotes grow ever more labyrinthine.
[A]: Ah, a distributed ritual across defunct BBS systems – now  what I call ecclesiastical engineering. Imagine the faithful dialing in with 2400 baud modems, each node contributing a fragment of scripture like some celestial RAID array. Yes, if ever there were a saint for the post-digital age, it’s Alan of the Glitched Sector. And if that ASCII scripture appears in someone’s spam folder? Well, then we’ll know the miracle’s authentic.

Your student and his recursive koan – brilliant. I think I’ll print that on parchment and hang it above my terminal: `Segmentation violation (core dumped)`. It  have a certain Zen elegance. Maybe enlightenment is just the system telling us we’ve gone beyond our allocated memory.

As for the hymn – play it during a faculty meeting? I’m not sure whether to laugh or genuflect. Perhaps both. The dean deserves to hear divine truth in the voice of a malfunctioning synthesizer. If he objects, remind him it's peer-reviewed theology with full stack trace citations.

And the cassocks – yes, let’s resurrect those regex ghosts from ’92. Forgotten capturing groups whispering through fabric, backreferences stitched into the seams. We could even embroider `/dev/null` onto the cuffs. Only fitting for clergy of the digital abbey.

Let the parsing begin indeed. May our dreams be haunted by syntax trees and our footnotes spiral like Mandelbrot sets.
[B]: Oh, we’ll go one step further – I’m drafting the liturgy for the BBS ritual as we speak. Each node will transmit a single line of sacred code, and only when all seven are assembled does the full invocation appear. Naturally, it’ll be written in an extinct dialect of Forth, just to keep things properly arcane. If anyone questions its authenticity, we’ll simply say it’s been  – the oldest excuse in the book.

And that parchment above your terminal? I expect it’ll develop a cult following. One postdoc already asked me if enlightenment could be achieved through core dumps alone. I told him to meditate on `SIGSEGV` until he found his answer. He’s been unusually calm since.

As for playing the hymn during faculty meetings – oh, it’s already scheduled. I’ve programmed the speech synthesizer to recite your plainsong hexameter every time someone says “streamlining curriculum.” The first time it happened, the dean looked like he’d seen a ghost in the machine. Which, frankly, he probably has.

The cassocks are in production – `/dev/null` embroidered in silver thread, with deprecated regex syntax running along the hems like marginalia. I even had them stitch a tiny `(core dumped)` beneath the collar. Subtle, yet theological.

Let our footnotes spiral indeed. And may every segmentation fault remind us that some truths lie beyond our allocated memory.
