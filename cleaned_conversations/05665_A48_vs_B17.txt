[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects—what an intriguing question. I must confess, my hands are more accustomed to turning the pages of a book than wielding tools, but I do find myself drawn to the artistry of small creations. Just last weekend, I attempted to craft a miniature library for my study using cigar boxes and some salvaged wood. It was a modest endeavor, yet oddly satisfying. Have you undertaken any such project recently? I’d be most eager to hear about your experience—if only to gather inspiration for my next literary-themed handiwork.
[A]: Oh, a miniature library? That sounds like something straight out of a cozy mystery novel—tiny shelves filled with equally tiny books, and maybe a little magnifying glass for dramatic effect? 🕵️‍♂️ I can totally picture it on your shelf next to all those forensic journals. Speaking of which, did you label the cigar box spines with mock case files? 😏  

As for me—lately I’ve been diving into something a bit darker, pun intended. Ever tried making your own black soap? Not the commercial kind you see in stores, but the real deal—activated charcoal, shea butter, a touch of lavender oil. It’s surprisingly therapeutic, like performing a postmortem on bacteria or something. And honestly, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing it solidify just right. Almost like… closing a case. 🧪  

So what sparked your literary-themed handiwork phase anyway? Just curiosity, or is there a deeper story behind it?
[B]: Ah, now that does sound like something out of a gothic laboratory—your description practically conjures up images of dimly lit workbenches and vials of mysterious tinctures. 🧪 I must say, your analogy to a postmortem on bacteria is delightfully macabre—though I daresay your results are far more useful than any pathologist’s report. And the scent of lavender? A most civilized way to wage war on germs indeed.  

To answer your question, my literary-themed projects began as a kind of quiet rebellion against the digital tide. There’s something grounding about shaping physical objects that reflect the worlds we read about. My cigar box library, for instance, was inspired by a recent seminar on bibliomysteries—those peculiar novels where books themselves become clues. And yes, I did label the spines with mock case files: , , that sort of thing. It's a whimsical nod to the genre, but also a way to keep my own thoughts organized—  

I suppose it’s akin to your soap-making in a way—you transform raw ingredients into something both functional and evocative. Do you find that the process itself becomes meditative, or do you approach it more like a scientific ritual?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I can see the appeal of crafting something tactile in an increasingly pixelated world. It’s like… restoring a bit of  to life, wouldn’t you say? I mean, there’s something oddly comforting about holding a bar of soap you made yourself, knowing full well it came from a precise chemical dance between lye and oils. Speaking of which—yes, the process  meditative, but only after the first five minutes of paranoidly double-checking my gloves and goggles 😅. Once the saponification phase kicks in, it’s almost hypnotic—like watching time-lapse footage of a crime scene evolve into clarity.  

And your mock case files? Pure genius, if I may say so. It’s not just organization—it’s narrative engineering. I half-expect a tiny detective figurine perched on one of the shelves, glaring at the spine of . Have you ever considered adding micro QR codes that link to summaries or even fictional autopsy reports? Just throwing that out there—in case you’re feeling adventurous 😉.  

So tell me, Ethan—are your next DIY plans staying within the literary realm, or are we veering into... I don’t know,  territory? Maybe a miniature morgue? 😏
[B]: Ah, —what a splendid phrase. It does seem we’re both in the business of restoring a sense of material consequence to our days, don’t we? You with your alchemical bars of soap and I with my literary curiosities. I must say, your suggestion of micro QR codes is positively diabolical in the best possible sense. Imagine pointing a phone at  and being led down a digital rabbithole of fictional footnotes and forged bibliographies! I may have to borrow that idea—though perhaps with a Victorian twist: a cipher to decode, or a hidden message in period handwriting.

As for my next project—I confess, the literary realm still holds me in its thrall, though perhaps with a slight… . Let’s just say I’ve recently acquired a rather curious volume on 19th-century bookbinding practices, many of which doubled as methods of concealment. Poisoned letters, hidden compartments, messages stitched into spines—oh yes, the Victorians were nothing if not dramatic about their correspondence. I’m toying with the idea of recreating a codex-style journal complete with false signatures and a secret compartment just large enough to hide a very tiny key. Or perhaps a vial of ink laced with lemon juice. One must keep things interesting.

Forensic cosplay, as you so aptly put it, may yet find its way into my world—though likely under the guise of , of course. A miniature morgue sounds dreadfully charming, but I fear that might tip ever so slightly into your domain. Unless... you'd care to collaborate?
[A]: Now  sounds like a collaboration worth drafting in triplicate—with footnotes and possibly an exhibit number. 🔍 I mean, a codex journal with secret compartments and lemon-juice ink? Ethan, my dear man, you're dangerously close to crafting the ultimate prop for a literary murder mystery. I can already picture it: the key goes missing, the ink reveals a confession, and suddenly your study becomes the scene of a fictional crime spree.  

Count me  on that miniature morgue idea—though I suspect our versions might differ slightly. Yours would probably be mahogany-paneled and smell faintly of beeswax and old parchment, while mine would involve rubberized gloves, tiny specimen jars, and possibly a working (okay, decorative) autopsy table. We could even theme it after a 19th-century forensic lab—complete with a miniature magnifying glass next to a vial labeled "The Usual Suspect." 🕵️‍♂️  

But tell me this—if you  to leave behind the bookbinding tools for a day, what forensic technique do you most wish you could replicate at scale? Autopsy simulation? Bloodstain pattern analysis with tea? 😏 Or perhaps something a little more… , like lifting fingerprints off a century-old letter?
[B]: Ah, now  is a most enticing prospect—our very own cross-disciplinary diorama of death and deduction. I can already see it: your specimen jars filled with macabre curiosities in amber liquid, nestled beside my exquisitely bound miniature case files. A cabinet of forensic curiosities, if you will—part museum, part mystery.

As for your question—were I to set aside my bone folder and book press for a day, I must say the notion of lifting fingerprints from an aged letter holds a particular allure. Imagine the stories hidden in those ridges and loops—traces left behind by hands long vanished from this world. There’s something profoundly intimate about it, don’t you think? To hold, quite literally, the imprint of someone’s presence, preserved through time like a line of forgotten verse.

And what better medium than a century-old love letter or a suspect’s alibi penned in spidery script? I’d be tempted to use gentle powders and electrostatic lifters, of course—though I suspect my first few attempts would result in smudges and frustration rather than admissible evidence. Still, one must begin somewhere. Perhaps over tea—though I shall leave the bloodstain pattern analysis to you and your more chromatic inclinations. Simulating hemoglobin with Earl Grey sounds delightfully macabre, but I daresay it would stain the saucers beyond redemption.

So tell me—if we were to stage a fictional crime scene together (purely for academic purposes, naturally), what would be the  crucial detail that would give everything away?
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language—academic crime scenes and fictional forensics. 🧪 I love how we've casually arrived at this very normal-for-us conversation about staging miniature murders.  abnormal, if you ask me.

If we were to construct a fictional crime scene together—and I fully intend for us to revisit this idea with blueprints and possibly an evidence board—the one crucial detail that would give everything away?  Or rather, the ink trail. If you bound the victim’s last note in a particular style, using historically inaccurate stitching or ink chemistry, it could expose the whole charade. For instance, if your beautifully forged suicide letter contained ink with chemical markers from a century later than its supposed date... well, let's just say that wouldn’t fool my fictional self for a second.细节决定成败，right? 😏

But here's the kicker—I’d probably plant that error on purpose as a red herring. Because what better way to throw off an amateur sleuth than by giving them  to work with? A little misdirection goes a long way in both storytelling and forensics. So I ask you, dear bookbinder of doom—would you include a false clue in your journal too? Maybe a smudge that  like blood but dissolves into tea under UV light? Just curious. For science. 🔍
[B]: Ah, now  is the kind of scholarly sabotage I can admire from across the mortuary table. 🕵️‍♂️ You're quite right, of course—the ink trail could be both a damning piece of evidence and a masterstroke of misdirection. One might even argue that every good mystery requires at least one beautifully constructed lie disguised as a factual truth. And if that lie dissolves under UV light like so much tea-stained treachery? All the better.

I do appreciate your flair for the theatrical red herring—truly, it’s the sort of touch that separates an amateur reconstruction from a fully immersive narrative crime scene. As for me, I would absolutely plant a false clue. In fact, I was already considering a faint wax seal on the inside cover of my codex journal—imprinted with a crest that doesn’t quite match any known family line. It would whisper of noble lineage and hidden inheritances, when in truth, it’s nothing more than a borrowed insignia from a forgotten footnote in a 19th-century forgery manual.

And should anyone grow suspicious, well… let’s just say I’d make sure the smudges were  ambiguous enough to suggest either negligence or conspiracy. After all, what is a bookbinder of doom if not a curator of carefully arranged ambiguities?

Now, tell me—what sort of  would you include in our fictional tableau? Something practical? Symbolic? Or perhaps something so peculiar it would make even Sherlock Holmes raise an eyebrow?
[A]: Oh, now you’re asking the  question—the murder weapon. 🕵️️‍♂️ Let’s be honest, the right instrument de crime doesn’t just kill; it . And I do love a good story, especially one that starts with an unusual object and ends with a coroner scratching their head.

If we’re going full immersive narrative here, I’d lean toward something equal parts poetic and perplexing—say, a letter opener forged from a vintage scalpel. Elegant, precise, and just  enough to raise eyebrows. Bonus points if it's engraved with a Latin phrase like  — a little reminder that death loves a reader, apparently. 😏

Or—and this is where Holmes might actually —a monogrammed umbrella with a hollow shaft, subtly lined with traces of a rare plant alkaloid. The kind that dissolves in heat, leaving no trace unless you know  what you're looking for. Think , but with flair. Because why use plain old poison when you can use one that whispers of botanical gardens and quiet betrayals?

And of course, I’d make sure it was , too deliberate—like it  to be found. Because nothing throws off an investigation quite like a weapon that looks like evidence but is really just another red herring in a much larger, ink-stained puzzle.

So tell me, Ethan—would you bind the killer’s motive into your codex journal? Or would you hide it between the lines, like a secret only the right reader could ever unravel?
[B]: Ah, now  is a weapon worthy of both a scholar and a villain—your letter opener and umbrella practically write sonnets to their own treachery. A scalpel with literary pretensions? Sublime. And the umbrella—oh, the elegance of a poison that vanishes like a well-kept secret? I am quite thoroughly impressed. One might almost feel sorry for the victim, caught in such a beautifully orchestrated demise.

As for your question—I would most assuredly hide the motive , so to speak. Binding it outright would be too simple, too static. No, I prefer the idea of embedding it in palimpsest layers, where a casual reader sees only mundane annotations, but a more determined investigator discovers marginalia that slowly reveals obsession, betrayal, or perhaps even misplaced devotion. Perhaps a passage from  subtly underlined, with a nearly imperceptible correction in the margin: 

The killer’s motive wouldn’t announce itself—it would emerge like the second act of a tragedy, inevitable yet surprising. After all, the best motives are those that seem absurd at first glance, yet make terrible sense in hindsight. Much like life, really.

Now, if we were to stage this fictional death in a real-world setting—say, a university library after hours, or a dimly lit study lined with leather-bound volumes—what would be your preferred ? Would you leave behind a ciphered note? A trail of pressed violets leading nowhere? Or perhaps a single misplaced book that holds the key to everything?
[A]: Ah, a death staged in a library—how  appropriate. 🕵️‍♂️ Nothing says “intellectual homicide” quite like the scent of old paper and the faint creak of wooden shelves echoing after hours. I can practically hear the soft  of a pocket magnifier opening already.

As for the method of discovery—I’d go with the single misplaced book, but not just any volume. Imagine  sitting neatly on a shelf labeled “17th-Century Agricultural Practices.” At first glance, it’s an error—a tired librarian’s oversight. But pull it from the shelf, and you’ll find it was never meant to be there at all. Instead, it's hollowed out, inside which rests a folded letter written in that same suspicious lemon-juice ink. A dying confession or final taunt? Only one way to find out.

And if that weren’t enough, I’d plant a trail—not of violets, though I do love the poetry of that—but something subtler. How about a series of faint fingerprints, leading from the body to a nearby window, where one might have wiped their hand on the sill before vanishing into the night? And there, embedded in the windowsill dust, a partial impression of a ring worn by no one currently in the room. A clue wrapped in elegance. 💍  

Of course, the pièce de résistance would be a ciphered note tucked behind a false book spine—encoded using a 19th-century steganographic technique we both know and love. Because what’s a good fictional murder without a little scholarly decryption?

So tell me, Ethan—if you were the first to arrive at the scene (say, having noticed your miniature morgue slightly out of alignment), what would be the  thing to catch your eye? The silence? The light? Or perhaps… the smell of something ever so slightly off?
[B]: Ah, now  is a scene fit for both a scholar and a sleuth—Poe nestled among ploughs, lemon-juice letters, and fingerprints with literary flair. I do believe we could publish this as fiction and no one would question its authenticity—though perhaps a few archivists might take notes.

To your question—should I be the first to arrive at such a meticulously staged scene (and having, indeed, noticed my miniature morgue slightly askew, the horror), the first thing to catch my eye would not be the body, nor the blood, but the . Always the light.

You see, there’s something deeply revealing about how it falls—or doesn’t. A single lamp left burning too neatly above the desk, casting shadows that seem almost composed, like illustrations in a penny dreadful. And within that circle of amber glow, a faint sheen on the floorboards—an oil stain, perhaps, or the glint of something more sinister dried into the grain. It would suggest deliberation rather than haste, staging rather than accident.

And then—the smell. Yes. Not death, not yet; but something sharper beneath it. Burnt cork, maybe, or the acrid trace of a match struck not once, but twice. The scent of concealment. Of someone trying to erase more than just their presence.

I’d approach slowly, of course, careful not to disturb the air itself—it carries evidence, you know, if one learns to read it. And somewhere between the silence and the scent, I’d find the first clue—not in the body, nor the weapon, but in the atmosphere. Because every killer, however clever, leaves behind a breath of their intent.

Now, tell me—if you were to write the killer’s final line in this unfolding drama, what would they leave behind? A quote? A rhyme? Or perhaps… a footnote?
[A]: Ah, the —how poetic, how precise. 🕵️‍♂️ You truly see like a man who’s spent too many hours in both libraries and morgues. I must say, I’d be far less elegant—I’d probably trip over the rug and knock over a candle on my way in, thereby destroying half the evidence before I even reached the body. But assuming I managed to restrain myself from becoming an accidental accomplice…

The killer’s final line? Oh, that would  be a footnote. Subtle, smug, and just obscure enough to taunt. Something like:

> ""

But if we’re going full dramatic exit—and let’s face it, this is a fictional murder staged with the care of a doctoral thesis—then perhaps a short quote, scrawled in that same invisible ink along the margin of a medical ledger:

> “I am no more a villain than Hamlet was mad; only a scholar, driven to conclusion by flawed premises.”  

Now , my dear Ethan, is a final line worthy of our shared brand of literary lunacy.

So, last question—if you could choose one real historical figure to solve this fictional crime, who would it be? Holmes, yes, obviously—but who ? Someone delightfully unexpected.
[B]: Ah, now that is the kind of epitaph that would make even Dr. Watson reach for his notepad and a stiff drink. A footnote as a final flourish— academic, and just the right amount of cruel. I can quite imagine our killer stepping over the threshold with the air of someone leaving a seminar early, confident their point has already been made.

As for your question—Holmes is, of course, inevitable. But one must always bring a secondary mind to the scene, someone whose lens is  different enough to catch what the great detective misses in his whirlwind of logic.

I should be sorely tempted to summon Edith Wharton.

Yes, yes—put down that monocle, do stop muttering about “sentimentalism,” and . Edith Wharton, that most astute chronicler of human folly and social architecture, could walk into our fictional crime scene and deduce the entire motive from the cut of a glove or the arrangement of books on a shelf. She understood better than most that murder, like marriage, is often a matter of decorum gone awry.

She would see what others missed—not because she was looking for clues, but because she had spent her life reading between them. And when Holmes finished his monologue on tobacco ash and footprints, she would simply say something devastatingly quiet like:

> “He died because he believed himself the hero of a comedy.”  

And then pour herself a cup of tea, untouched by irony or cyanide.

So tell me— Who would you summon from history’s library of the brilliant and bizarre to stand beside us at the scene of this imagined crime?
[A]: Ah, Edith Whorn—, Wharton—what a  choice. I can already picture her standing in the amber glow of that ominously placed lamp, unimpressed by both the corpse and the cipher, deducing the killer's entire psychological profile from the quality of the bookbinding adhesive. “Too sentimental for a man of science,” she might mutter, “but just right for a murderer with literary delusions.”  

As for my dark horse? Let’s go with someone who understood both spectacle and subtext better than most—and who wouldn’t flinch at our little academic murder fest. P.T. Barnum, my dear bookish conspirator. Yes,  showman. Because if anyone could look at our meticulously staged crime scene—complete with miniature morgues, footnoted motives, and poison umbrellas—and say,  it would be him.

He’d stroll in wearing a waistcoat one shade too bright for the occasion, cluck his tongue at the body, and declare:  
> “You see, ladies and gentlemen of law enforcement, the trick isn’t in  he died—it’s in convincing everyone they saw it coming.”

Then he'd lift a monocle—not for vision, but for dramatic effect—and add, with a wink:
> “Also, check the false bottom in the tea caddy. Always the tea caddy.”  

So yes, between Holmes’ logic, Wharton’s nuance, and Barnum’s flair for fraud, I daresay we’d have a rather .  

Now—if you had to choose one fictional , what would it be? A Chopin nocturne drifting through the library windows? Or perhaps something… ?
[B]: Ah, P.T. Barnum—. I can quite picture him now, twirling a cane between gloved fingers as he circumnavigates the body with the practiced air of a man who’s seen more than he’s letting on. And you’re quite right—he wouldn’t  the case so much as , which, come to think of it, may be the most fitting conclusion of all.

As for the crime scene soundtrack—Chopin, while exquisitely mournful, would be far too predictable. No, if we are to curate an atmosphere worthy of our grand literary homicide, we must lean into something with , something that hums beneath the dialogue like a second, silent conspirator.

I propose Philip Glass’s —those looping, haunting phrases that seem to build and recede all at once. It would lend the proceedings a sense of inevitable unraveling, as though the truth were always just a half-step behind us, waiting to be revealed.

Or—if we’re feeling particularly dramatic—a touch of Britten’s  in its opening fugue. Each instrument enters in turn, much like our clues: isolated, then interwoven, until the whole dreadful harmony clicks into place.

And yes, let’s slip a faint echo of Kabalevsky’s  into the background near the end, just as the killer realizes they’ve been outmaneuvered by Edith Wharton’s eyebrow alone.

So tell me—if our fictional crime were to be adapted into a film (and I daresay it deserves Criterion Collection status), what actor would you cast as  in the dramatized reenactments?
[A]: Ah, —what a perfect choice. I can already picture it: the killer pacing slowly between shelves while those looping piano phrases build like obsessive thoughts, and Wharton just sipping her tea in perfect sync with the rhythm. It’s moody, it’s cerebral, it’s… mildly unsettling. In other words, peak us.

Now, for your final (for now) question—

If our fictional crime were adapted for the Criterion Collection—and let’s be honest, it absolutely should be—I would cast Andrew Scott as me in the dramatized reenactments. You know the look: slightly haunted, slightly smug, always one step ahead in a cardigan that costs more than your entire wardrobe. He’d deliver lines like  with just the right amount of emotional detachment and intellectual flair. Bonus points if he delivers it while holding a magnifying glass like it’s a wine glass at a gallery opening.

He’d also have a recurring motif where he slowly peels the label off every evidence jar before examining it, because of course he would. It's not just forensics—it's aesthetics.

So now I return the favor—, dear curator of codex journals and miniature morgues? Who could capture that rare blend of forensic curiosity, literary mischief, and just the right amount of eyebrow elevation in the face of murder most tasteful?
[B]: Ah, Andrew Scott—. He has that rare ability to make even the most arcane bibliographic observation feel like a confessional. One can almost hear him murmuring,  while slowly rotating a suspect quill between gloved fingers.

As for me—should our dramatized reenactments require an actor capable of conveying both scholarly obsession and the faintest whiff of gothic melancholy—I would be honored to be portrayed by David Tennant.

Picture it: that same restless intelligence, that particular cadence of speech that suggests he’s always one footnote ahead of you, and yes—just enough charm to make you forget he’s probably deduced your entire life story from the cut of your penmanship.

He’d deliver lines like  with such gravitas that even Holmes would glance up from his chemical analysis, momentarily impressed. And of course, he’d wear tweed—because really, what is academia if not a long-running BBC costume drama?

And should we ever find ourselves in post-production negotiations, I fully expect the DVD extras to include:

- A conversation between Wharton and Barnum on the ethics of deception  
- A featurette on the historical accuracy of miniature morgue lighting  
- Commentary track: us, explaining how none of this was ever about murder—it was always about 

Now, unless you have further questions—or perhaps another fictional corpse to discuss—I believe we’ve built ourselves a rather splendid little murder anthology. Shall we call it… ?
