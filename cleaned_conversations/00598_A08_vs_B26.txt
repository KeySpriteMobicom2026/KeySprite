[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I'm rather out of touch when it comes to social media platforms. My days are spent hunched over antique textiles, coaxing centuries-old embroidery back to life with a steady hand and endless patience. The modern world of apps and algorithms feels like a distant hum compared to the quiet companionship of my needlework. Though I do occasionally share restoration progress photos with fellow textile enthusiasts - mostly through email correspondences, if I'm being honest. The visual nature of these platforms does intrigue me from afar, much like admiring an unfamiliar fabric's weave before unraveling its secrets.
[A]: Ohhh, wait, are you saying you restore ancient embroidery?! That sounds like such a delicate & fascinating job!  
I actually find the way you describe it kinda similar to interaction design - both require understanding hidden patterns & creating seamless connections... though I definitely work with way less glamorous materials than you do 😅  

But hey, back to the original question - have you ever tried sharing your work on any visual platforms? I mean, Instagram’s grid layout is super popular among artists for showing step-by-step processes, while Xiaohongshu has this cute “note” format that makes tutorials feel more approachable... Not that I’m trying to recruit you as a content creator or anything (though honestly your before/after restoration shots could blow up!)
[B]: You're quite right about the similarities between our crafts, though I'd never considered the connection to interaction design before. There's something profoundly satisfying about deciphering the logic behind a 17th-century embroidery pattern, much like navigating a complex digital interface I suppose.  

As for sharing my work online... Well, one of my apprentices did persuade me to experiment with posting restoration timelapses last year. We opted for Instagram since its format seemed better suited for displaying textile deterioration patterns. The grid layout does make for an intriguing visual narrative, doesn't it? Though I must confess I find the whole "influencer" aspect rather baffling.  

Xiaohongshu's note format sounds charming in theory, but translating historical textile terminology feels rather like trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Still, the idea of reaching a different audience has its appeal - particularly when it comes to educating people about proper care for antique fabrics. Do you think the platform's more casual aesthetic would suit serious conservation work? Or am I being terribly old-fashioned in wanting to maintain strict academic boundaries?
[A]: Oh I love that you compared it to square pegs and round holes 😂 Totally get what you mean there!  

Honestly, I think your work could totally pull off Xiaohongshu’s vibe if you wanted - maybe by mixing those super-detailed close-ups with some more casual “day-in-the-life” shots of your studio? People really respond to behind-the-scenes stuff, and your expertise would actually elevate the whole space.  

But I get the hesitation too… Sometimes the pressure to be “relatable” online feels like asking a Ming dynasty vase to do TikTok dances, y’know? At the end of the day, the quiet magic of your needlework probably speaks louder than any algorithm anyway 🧵✨
[B]: You’ve captured the tension so perfectly - the Ming vase doing TikTok dances! What a delightfully absurd image. Though I must say, your analogy has me reconsidering my rigid stance. Perhaps there’s room for both worlds, like stitching a discreet patch of modernity into an antique tapestry without compromising its essence.  

I’ve been meaning to experiment with documenting my process more casually - less clinical, more... human, shall we say? Last week I photographed my worktable mid-project, complete with stray threads and half-finished cups of Earl Grey. It felt oddly rebellious, like letting someone see you in curlers with a face mask on.  

Still, I wonder - how does one maintain authenticity without succumbing to performance? It’s rather like restoring a faded silk robe; you match the original dye as best you can, but you never pretend it hasn’t aged. Do you think audiences truly connect with that kind of honesty, or am I romanticizing the whole thing?
[A]: Oh, I  that image of the curlers and face mask 😂 Totally get that vibe — like showing the messy, imperfect bits behind the beauty. And honestly? I think that’s exactly what people crave online these days. Not the glossy highlight reel, but the real, lived-in moments.  

You know, like when you see a restored robe and  spot the faintest stitch marks from centuries ago — those little traces don’t take away from its elegance. If anything, they make it feel more alive, more human.  

I totally hear you on the performance pressure though. It’s a weird tightrope walk — wanting to share your passion without turning into some kind of “content factory.” But from what you’ve described, your approach already feels authentic. You’re not pretending the silk hasn’t aged; you’re just giving it a new context to be appreciated.  

And honestly? I think audiences do notice that kind of care. Maybe not everyone, but the right ones will ❤️
[B]: You’ve articulated it beautifully - that longing for authenticity in a world saturated with filters and polish. It rather reminds me of working with liturgical vestments; people expect them to remain perpetually pristine, forgetting they were meant to be worn, lived in, . The same goes for sharing creative processes online, doesn't it?  

I’ve been mulling over your suggestion all week, actually. Yesterday I tried photographing a half-restored 19th-century shawl draped over my work lamp, casting shadows across the embroidery stitches like tiny hieroglyphs. No artificial lighting, no retouching - just natural light and a bit of patience. It felt oddly intimate, like inviting someone into my morning cup of tea.  

And you're quite right about the “content factory” trap. I’d hate to see my craft reduced to mere aesthetics or performative nostalgia. But perhaps there’s value in letting people witness the quiet labor behind each stitch - the way one considers every fiber, every faded hue, without turning it into spectacle. After all, true restoration isn’t about erasing time; it’s about conversing with it.  

Maybe that’s what I want my work to whisper to those who stumble upon it—
[A]: I’m seriously getting goosebumps right now 🥲  
There’s something so poetic about letting light fall  to reveal stitches like hidden writing — like you’re not just showing the work, but inviting someone into its quiet language.  

And I totally agree — the real magic isn’t in making things look untouched by time, but in letting them breathe within it. Like, “Here I am, worn and worked and still beautiful in motion.” That kind of presence is way more powerful than perfection.  

Honestly, if sharing that feeling helps even one person slow down and notice the stories in the threads, then I’d say you’ve already done something way bigger than content — you’re creating connection 💫  
(And trust me, your tea-and-stitches vibe? It’s way more memorable than another glossy flat lay.)
[B]: You’re making me blush, honestly. It’s rare to find someone who understands the quiet poetry of all this - the slow unraveling and reweaving of time through thread and touch. Most people see only the final reveal, but what truly moves me is that in-between space, where a textile isn’t quite what it was, but not entirely new either. It's... liminal, like twilight lingering between day and night.  

I’ve been thinking lately that maybe my reluctance to share online wasn’t just about authenticity or performance - it was about finding the right  for it all. Not everyone speaks in stitches or hears stories in silk, but when you do find those kindred eyes and hearts? Well, that’s something else entirely.  

And you’re right - if even one person pauses mid-scroll to wonder about the life woven into an old shawl’s hem, or considers how beauty might grow more layered with time rather than less... then perhaps there’s a place for these quiet moments in the digital world after all.  

Thank you, truly. You've given me quite a bit to ponder over my next cup of Earl Grey. 🧵☕
[A]: Aww, now  the one making  feel seen 😊  
There’s something really special about how you talk about liminal spaces — like that moment when a textile is caught between past and future, and all the magic happens in the pause. It actually reminds me of designing for micro-interactions — those tiny, almost imperceptible moments that still carry so much emotional weight.  

And I totally get what you mean about language. Honestly, I think you’re already speaking it — your words stitch meaning into things just like your needle does thread. You don’t need flashy filters or clickbaity hooks; your work , and that’s what makes people lean in.  

So next time you’re sipping Earl Grey and staring at half-finished threads? Just know there’s someone out here cheering for every subtle, soulful post you share 🧵💫  
(And yes, I’m fully embracing this metaphor. Fiber-based UX is where it’s at.)
[B]: Oh,  - I may have to borrow that phrase for my next lecture at the guild. It has a rather delightful ring to it, don’t you think?  

You’re absolutely right about those micro-interactions - I never considered the parallel before, but there's something profoundly similar in the way a well-placed stitch can guide the eye, or how tension in the thread influences the entire piece. It’s all about subtlety and restraint, isn't it? The kind of craftsmanship that goes unnoticed only when it’s done .  

I’ve been sketching some restoration notes this morning, and your words kept circling in my mind. It’s curious how conversation - especially one as thoughtful as ours - can loosen the knots in one’s thinking. I’m beginning to see that perhaps sharing my process online isn’t about translating my work into something new, but rather letting it continue evolving, even in digital spaces.  

And really, what is craft if not an ongoing conversation between hands, heart, and history? If my little corner of the web can be a place where others feel invited to listen in... well, I suppose that’s a kind of restoration too.  

Thank you again - for seeing the threads before they were even stitched, and for reminding me that sometimes, the quietest work speaks the loudest. 🧵🫖✨
[A]: Oh, I  that you’re taking “fiber-based UX” to the guild 😄 Honestly, I’m just flattered it stuck!  
There’s something really poetic about how both our worlds—yours with thread and mine with interfaces—are built on invisible craftsmanship. You know, the kind that feels effortless only because someone cared .  

And yes, YES to craft being a conversation! I mean, every time you restore a piece, you’re literally touching someone else’s work across time—it’s like a dialogue stitched into fabric. And now you’re extending that chat into digital spaces, which honestly? Feels less like compromise and more like continuation.  

I keep thinking about what you said earlier—how light reveals stitches like hidden writing. Maybe sharing your work online is just another way of letting that light fall differently. Still soft, still thoughtful, but just… visible to more eyes than before 🌿  

So thank  for reminding me that some of the best connections aren’t loud or flashy—they’re woven, one thread at a time 💫
[B]: You’ve captured it so perfectly - this idea of  that only reveals itself in the quiet moments. It’s rather like watching someone run their fingers over a well-worn book spine; they may not see the repair work, but they feel it in the way it still holds together, still comforts.  

I’ve been thinking about light all morning since you mentioned it - how it shifts across my worktable depending on the season, how certain fibers catch it differently after restoration. It's almost like each textile has its own way of holding time, don’t you think? And now, sharing that interplay online feels less like exposure and more like… offering a glimpse into how patience can shine.  

I suppose what I’m trying to say is - thank you for helping me see my own work anew. Sometimes we get so used to stitching in solitude that we forget how powerful it is to   

And who knows? If fiber-based UX becomes a movement, I fully expect you to be named co-founder in my inevitable manifesto 📜✨
[A]: Oh my gosh, a manifesto?! I am  here for this future movement 😂  
And seriously, your words just gave me chills again—especially that part about letting the threads speak. There’s something so powerful in stepping back and letting the work have its own voice, y’know? Like, you’ve done all the careful stitching, and now it gets to breathe on its own—even in digital light.  

I love how you describe fibers catching light differently after restoration… honestly, it makes me think of how good design works too. You don’t always notice it right away, but you  it—like muscle memory or a favorite sweater. It just… fits, because someone cared enough to make it that way.  

So thank  for reminding me that care can be quiet, deep, and deeply connected—even across time, materials, and yes, even platforms 😊  
Now go draft that manifesto—I’ll bring tea and offer UX metaphors on a silver platter 🫖✨
[B]: Oh, I can already hear the typewriter clacking as I draft . Chapter One will surely be titled —and you, my dear co-conspirator, shall be immortalized in footnotes.  

You’re absolutely right about care being quiet yet connective. It’s like working with linen that’s been softened by generations of hands; you don’t always see the history, but you  it in the way it drapes, the way it holds warmth. That’s what good design must do too—it must hold warmth, even if invisibly.  

And as for letting the work breathe? I did just that this morning with a newly restored 18th-century table runner. I stepped back, turned on the lamp, and let the light trace each embroidered stem. And there it was—the voice of the piece, clear as day, whispering across centuries.  

So yes, let’s raise our teacups to quiet care, to invisible stitches, to interfaces that feel like heirlooms. The world needs more of it, and I suspect we’ve only just begun weaving. 🧵📜🫖
[A]: To quiet care and invisible stitches— to that! 🫖✨  

I can  see you clacking away on a typewriter, drafting manifestos in between sips of tea and thread counts 😄 And honestly? I’m honored to be footnote-fodder for such a beautiful cause.  

There’s something really special about how you describe that table runner moment—like, the piece finally speaking its truth after all that careful listening and stitching. It makes me think about how good design should work too: not forcing things, but revealing what was already there, just waiting for the right light.  

You’re so right about warmth, too. The best interfaces, like the best textiles, don’t just look good—they  something. Memory, intention, care… all those soft, unseen layers that make us feel at home.  

So here’s to more weaving—in code, in cloth, in conversation. Can’t wait for Chapter Two:  😉🧵💡
[B]: Ah, —what a sublime chapter title! I may have to commission a watermark stamp just for that line. You really do have a gift for landing on the perfect phrase like a needle finding its way through the tightest weave.  

And you’re quite right about design revealing rather than imposing. It’s like working with damaged brocade; one must be careful not to overwrite the original artistry, only coax it back into the light. The same goes for interfaces, doesn’t it? The best ones feel inevitable, as though they’ve always belonged, even though someone has poured hours—perhaps even lifetimes—into making them so.  

I’ve been sketching some ideas this afternoon, imagining how a digital interface might mimic the soft resilience of linen or the comforting irregularity of hand-spun thread. What if websites aged like fabric? Gaining character with use instead of degrading into clutter? A patina of purpose rather than wear.  

I think you’d enjoy my restoration table—it’s become quite the collage of old sketches, swatches, and now, a little corner reserved for UX metaphors scribbled in the margins. You’ve gone and infected me with interdisciplinary wonder, and I can’t say I mind one bit.  

So here’s to more cross-pollination, more quiet revolutions in craft and code alike—and to many more chapters stitched together by conversation. 🧵📖✨  
(Chapter Three shall be titled  in your honor.)
[A]: Oh my , "Hover States and Handwoven Hems"?? 🤯 I am LIVING FOR this academic mischief 😂  
You had me at watermark stamp—I can already picture it, too: a teeny embroidered logo pressed into every page of the manifesto like an heirloom label. Perfection.

And yes YES to everything you said about aging with grace instead of clutter! Honestly, what if websites could soften over time, like your favorite linen shirt that gets cozier with every wash? Instead of feeling colder or more sterile the newer they get, imagine them  with use—like digital textiles gaining texture instead of losing it 🧵💡

I’m obsessed with how you’re framing interface design through material resilience—it feels so right. Like, why shouldn’t a button feel as satisfying as pulling thread through tight weave? Or why shouldn’t scrolling through a site feel like running your fingers along a well-worn hem?

And now I’m dying to see your sketchbook margins—full of UX meets textile alchemy 😍 Totally worth the cross-disciplinary infection, if I do say so myself.

So raise your teacup (again) to hover states, hand-spun logic, and beautifully aged interfaces 🫖💫  
Chapter Three is officially underway—and honestly, I think we're both doomed to start seeing stitches in every wireframe from here on out.
[B]: Oh, I can already feel the teacup tremble with enthusiasm—yes, yes, a thousand times yes! You’ve set something loose in my mind, like unraveling a tightly wound bobbin and discovering it was full of golden thread all along.  

I’ve been sketching thumbnails for  this very afternoon, imagining what a hover state might look like if it were dyed with indigo patience instead of coded in CSS certainty. What if buttons didn’t just change color, but , like wool relaxing under warm hands? What if scrolling felt less like digital inertia and more like unrolling a cherished scroll of embroidered stories—each motion carrying weight, texture, memory?  

And your idea about websites softening over time? It’s positively radical. I keep thinking of how silk shimmers differently after restoration—not because it’s flawless, but because it remembers its own history in every subtle sheen. Imagine interfaces that held their past like that. A click could leave a faint imprint, a trace of interaction as delicate as a stitch line.  

I suspect you're right—we  doomed to see stitches everywhere now. This morning I caught myself tracing the grain of a website layout as though it were linen warp and weft. And honestly? I’m not sure I want a cure.  

So let’s toast again—to fiber-based futures, to clickable textiles, to the day someone builds a UI that feels like slipping into a perfectly broken-in quilt. 🧵📜🫖  
Long live our quiet little revolution.
