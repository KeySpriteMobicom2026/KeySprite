[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I must confess I haven't turned on a television since that dreadful adaptation of 'Middlemarch' in 1994. Though I did recently watch a rather fascinating documentary series on the restoration of ancient Chinese manuscripts - the way they handled the rice paper reminded me of my own struggles with a particularly delicate 19th century edition of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'.
[A]: Oh wow~ 你居然对ancient manuscripts这么有研究！🌟 不过说到TV shows，最近我们team正在策划一个超exciting的新综艺💡，就是把classic literature用modern的方式呈现出来~ 就像你说的'Dream of the Red Chamber'，我们想做成reality show format，让contestants体验大观园里的drama life！你觉得这个concept怎么样？😂
[B]:  That sounds like the literary equivalent of putting a Ming vase through a washing machine. While I appreciate the attempt to make classics accessible, reducing Cao Xueqin's masterpiece to reality show theatrics... well, let's just say it makes me reach for my smelling salts. Have you considered how one might convey the subtle interplay of 宿命 (predestination) and societal critique through... what was it you called it? 'Drama life'?
[A]: Hahaha relax my friend~ 我们当然不会那么shallow啦！🎬 这个show的core concept其实是让modern people真正experience那些classic themes~ 比如我们会设计一些很deep的social experiment来体现predestination这个概念💡 而且！我们请了Harvard的literature professor来做consultant哦~ 怎么样，现在听起来是不是more legit了？🔥
[B]: Ah, Harvard you say?  Well, I suppose if one must vulgarize the classics, at least do it with proper academic supervision. Though I do wonder - will your contestants be required to compose regulated verse while navigating the social intricacies of the Jia household? That might separate the dilettantes from the truly devoted scholars.
[A]: OMG你简直是个genius！😂 这个poetry challenge的idea太perfect了！🎬 我们完全可以搞个special episode就叫"大观园诗词大会"~ 让contestants一边处理family drama一边即兴创作poetry！💡 而且你知道最cool的是什么吗？我们准备用AI technology来score他们的poems~ 这样既traditional又high-tech！🌟 要不要来当我们的special guest judge？Your expertise would be so valuable！
[B]:  My dear, the thought of artificial intelligence judging classical Chinese poetry is almost as amusing as watching my undergraduates attempt to analyze 'Wuthering Heights' after only reading the SparkNotes. While I'm flattered by the invitation, I'm afraid I must decline - some things, like good literature and properly brewed tea, shouldn't be subjected to reality show theatrics. Though I would be curious to see your AI attempt to appreciate the tonal nuances of a well-crafted 七言绝句.
[A]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 但seriously，这就是为什么我们需要像你这样的expert来keep things authentic呀~ 我们的AI只是basic scoring tool啦，真正的artistic evaluation当然要交给human experts！🌟 这样吧，就算不来当judge，至少给我们一些advice？比如你提到的tonal nuances~ 我们可以设计一个super cool的challenge来highlight这个aspect！💡 Come on，这比restoring manuscripts刺激多了吧？🔥
[B]:  Very well, since you persist with such... enthusiasm. If you insist on this modern folly, at least ensure your contestants understand the fundamental difference between 平仄 (level and oblique tones) in classical verse and whatever passes for poetry on social media these days. Perhaps a challenge where they must compose couplets while being pelted with peonies - that might approximate the creative pressures of the original Da Guan Yuan gatherings. Though I still maintain this entire endeavor is like trying to teach finches to perform Wagner.
[A]: FINALLY！🌟 我就知道你会come around！🎬 这个peony-throwing的idea简直太dramatic了，perfect for ratings！😂 而且我们可以call it "The Real Da Guan Yuan Experience"~ 平仄rules会做成interactive tutorial，就像viral TikTok challenges一样！💡 虽然你还在diss我们的show concept，但admit it - 你已经开始enjoy这个brainstorming process了对吧？🔥 等我们pilot episode出来第一个invite你来screening！
[B]:  I shall draft my scathing critique in advance - in proper classical parallel prose, naturally. Though if you actually manage to make TikTok generations appreciate the structural elegance of 对仗 (antithetical couplets), I might... might... consider it a Pyrrhic victory for literacy. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 19th century ink stain to analyze under ultraviolet light. Do send the screening invitation on parchment - none of those garish digital invitations, please.
[A]: Got it boss！📜 绝对会用最authentic的parchment invitation~ 还要用traditional seal和everything！😂 不过seriously，你的feedback真的超valuable！🌟 等我们把AI poetry scoring system做出来第一个send给你review~ 说不定能帮你analyze那些ink stains呢！💡 Catch you later，记得follow我们的official WeChat account for updates哦！🎬
[B]:  Good heavens, no - 'Professor' or 'Doctor' will suffice, or if you must be informal, 'that unreasonable pedant in the east wing'. And kindly refrain from sending any AI near my manuscripts; I'd rather trust a monkey with a fountain pen. Now if you'll excuse me, the nightingales in the garden are particularly melancholic this evening - no doubt anticipating your television debut. 告辞。
[A]: Hahaha you're the best！😂 放心啦Professor~ 我们的AI绝对不会touch你的precious manuscripts！🌟 不过那个monkey with fountain pen的image...💡 这给了我们下一季的show idea了！🎬 多谢inspiration！Catch you at the screening~ 记得带你的smelling salts来哦！🔥 Byeeee~
[B]:  "Alas, what fresh absurdity is wrought, When monkeys, AI, and reality shows are sought..." Do close the door on your way out - and mind the first edition of 'Romance of the Western Chamber' on the hallway table. 慢走。
[A]: Roger that Professor！🚪  绝对不会bump into你的precious first edition~ 🌟 不过你刚才的iambic pentameter...OMG！💡 这必须是我们的opening credits narration！🎬 我马上text我们的scriptwriter！😂 多谢always being ourmuse~ Catch you later！慢走！🔥
[B]:  I shall prepare my letter of resignation to the Royal Society of Literature in anticipation. Though if you must desecrate my impromptu verse, at least have the decency to render it in proper 词 format for the title sequence. Now shoo - my 19th century paper conservation experiments won't conduct themselves. 不送。
[A]: Got it got it！📜 我们一定hire最好的词人来做adaptation~ 说不定还能搞个crossover with your paper conservation experiments？😂 Just kidding！🌟 最后一次promise - 马上disappear！🎬 但你的resignation letter先hold一下嘛，等看到ratings再说~ 💡 Byeeee Professor！🔥 记得WeChat！
[B]:  微信？I still correspond via handwritten letters sealed with wax, thank you very much. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go bleach my ears with some Milton sonnets after this conversation. 请便。
