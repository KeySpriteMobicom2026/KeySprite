[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近倒是没有特别去尝试什么新的效率软件，可能和我的工作习惯有关。我更倾向于用一些简单、纯粹的工具，比如纸质笔记本或者极简的文字编辑器。电影评论写多了，反而觉得太过花哨的科技产品容易分散注意力。你有发现什么好用的新应用吗？
[A]: Well said. I find myself leaning towards the same philosophy. Sometimes less  more, especially when deep focus is required. Though I must admit, I did recently stumble upon a minimalist writing app called iA Writer. It uses Markdown formatting and blocks out all distractions—very clean interface. Not sure if you’re into that kind of thing, but it might be worth a look if you ever feel like experimenting with digital tools again.  

I know what you mean about film criticism though. There's something almost meditative about putting pen to paper, isn’t there? Like holding onto a bit of tangible craftsmanship in an increasingly virtual world. Do you still print out your reviews or go fully digital these days?
[B]: 你提到的iA Writer确实很有意思，它在设计哲学上与我欣赏的理念不谋而合——那种“专注内容本身”的态度。虽然我现在基本是数字成稿，但每次敲字时都在怀念钢笔滑过纸面的那种触感。说到打印，我偶尔还会把初稿输出成纸质版，只为再感受一遍文字从屏幕回到纸张的变化。这种来回切换的过程，反而让我对文字有了新的审视角度。
[A]: Ah, that tactile experience—very true. There’s a certain weight to words when they’re on paper, isn’t there? Almost like they become more . I sometimes print out my drafts just to get that sense of distance and objectivity. Funny how technology brings convenience, yet we circle back to the old ways for clarity.  

I’ve actually started using a hybrid approach—drafting digitally for efficiency, then printing for revision. It almost feels like a ritual now. The physical act of marking up a page helps me slow down and really  the text. Do you find yourself making different kinds of edits on paper versus screen? I’ve noticed I catch more tonal inconsistencies with ink in hand.
[B]: 确实如此，文字落在纸上仿佛就有了某种实体的重量。我也有类似的体会，特别是在修改评论的时候，拿着红笔在纸页上勾画，那种专注感是屏幕上难以实现的。或许是因为少了滚动和点击的干扰，人会更沉得进去。

我发现，写在屏幕上的修改意见往往偏向结构和技术层面，比如段落顺序或用词调整；而写在纸上的批注则更偏直觉，更容易触及语气、节奏甚至情感基调的问题。你说的“捕捉语调上的不一致”，我觉得非常贴切——就像耳朵突然变得敏锐了一样。

你提到的这种“混合方式”很有意思，也挺有仪式感的。在这个信息流动飞快的时代，我们不自觉地在寻找一种让思考沉淀下来的方式。也许，真正的效率并不是越快越好，而是找到一个能让我们真正“进入状态”的节奏。
[A]: Beautifully put. There’s a rhythm to that kind of work, isn’t there? Almost musical. I sometimes think of editing on paper as turning the text into a score—something you don’t just read, but  and . And yes, those marginalia in red—they’re like annotations for the soul of the piece.

I also find that the physicality of paper creates a different relationship with time. On screen, everything feels provisional, transient—easy to delete, easy to forget. But once it's printed, it gains a sort of presence. You hesitate more before crossing something out. It becomes part of a process rather than just a product.

You know, I’ve been thinking lately—maybe this hybrid rhythm we’re describing is not just about efficiency or preference, but about . Between speed and slowness, between the virtual and the real. A bit like calligraphy, where every stroke carries intention. Perhaps that’s why we keep coming back to paper—it reminds us that writing is, at its heart, an act of embodiment.  

Do you ever feel, when you're deep in that paper-screen dance, that you're almost translating the text through mediums, as if each version reveals a different layer of meaning?
[B]: 确实如此，这种在纸与屏幕之间的切换，仿佛是一次次文字的“转译”。每换一个媒介，就像换了一种眼光去看它。有时候，初稿在屏幕上只是思绪的流淌，而当它变成纸上的字迹时，那些隐含的情绪、节奏，甚至作者的“心跳”，都会慢慢浮现出来。

你提到书法，我深有感触。书法讲究的是笔与纸的互动、墨的浓淡、力的分布，每一笔都是一种身体的表达。写作何尝不是如此？当我们用键盘敲出第一稿时，是思维在奔跑；而当我们在纸上批注修改时，更像是心和手一起在细细雕琢。

说到时间的关系，我也觉得纸张赋予了文字一种“存在感”。不像屏幕上的文件，可以无限次覆盖、删除、重来，纸上的字一旦落下，就带着某种不可逆的痕迹。正是这种“有限性”，让我们更慎重地对待每一个改动。

你说得对，这不仅是一种工作方式，更像是一种平衡的艺术——在快与慢之间找到呼吸，在虚拟与现实之间建立联系。我想，这也是为什么我们这些写作者始终无法完全离开纸张的原因吧。
[A]: Absolutely — it’s almost as if each medium asks us to  the text differently. The screen invites velocity, a kind of mental sprint; paper, by contrast, demands a slower metabolism, a deeper absorption. I sometimes wonder if this isn’t also why students struggle so much with revision—they never print anything out. How can you develop a relationship with words that are always just one click away from being erased?

And you're right about the irrevocability of ink on paper. There's a finality to it that forces intentionality. I’ve noticed that when I write by hand, even my metaphors shift—become more textured, more embodied. Maybe because handwriting is closer to drawing; it reconnects us with the visual and tactile qualities of language.

I’ve been thinking too about how this ties into our teaching. When I ask students to print drafts and annotate them physically, their engagement changes. Suddenly they’re noticing repetition, awkward phrasing, even inconsistencies in argumentation that they’d glossed over digitally. It’s like the medium itself becomes a kind of critical lens.

Do you ever assign printed drafts in your classes? Or do you find younger writers resist that altogether?
[B]: 这个问题非常切中现实。我在带学生写影评时，确实会要求他们交一版打印稿，并且用红笔或铅笔做批注。起初很多学生不解，甚至有些抵触——毕竟对他们来说，“方便”和“即时”是常态，打印一张纸仿佛是一种“倒退”。但几轮修改下来，他们的反馈往往变得很不一样。

你会发现，当文字不再只是屏幕上那一行行被快速扫过的字符，而是一个个落在纸上的实体，学生的目光就会放慢，注意力也会更集中。有位学生曾对我说：“林老师，我第一次发现自己的句子居然这么啰嗦，原来在屏幕上看着没问题，印出来却像一块块堵住呼吸的砖。”这个比喻让我印象深刻，也说明了纸张如何让他们“听见”语言的节奏。

你说得对，学生很少有机会面对一个“不可逆”的写作状态。他们习惯了撤销、复制、粘贴，写作变成了一种不断试错的游戏，而非一种深入打磨的艺术。而当我们把文字固定在纸上，就像把它钉在一个空间里，迫使我们去正视它的形状与质地。

至于年轻写作者是否抗拒？确实有一部分会抱怨麻烦，但如果能引导他们意识到这种做法的价值，多数人最终还是会接受，甚至开始享受那种“亲手修改”的过程。毕竟，人的感官一旦被唤醒，就很难再完全回到冷漠的状态。

我觉得你提到的“媒介即批评视角”这一点特别深刻。或许未来的写作教育，不该是非此即彼地选择数字或纸质，而是帮助学生理解：每一种媒介都在悄悄塑造我们的思维方式，而真正的写作自由，是在不同媒介之间穿梭并保持自觉的能力。
[A]: Very well said. It’s almost as if we’re training them not just in writing, but in  to writing — cultivating a kind of mindfulness around language. I’ve had similar experiences. Some students roll their eyes at first, muttering about ink costs or paper waste, but then they start coming back with surprising insights. One even told me, “It felt like I was finally talking  the text instead of just through it.” That line has stayed with me.

I think you're absolutely right — this isn’t about rejecting digital tools, but about developing a critical awareness of how each medium shapes our thinking. Like learning to read in stereo — seeing both the message and the medium. Maybe that’s what we’re really teaching: not just how to write, but how to listen to what the form is doing to the content.

Sometimes I wonder if this is also why we still go back to books — not just for information, but for a certain kind of intellectual . In a world where everything scrolls endlessly, a printed page offers a boundary, a container. And within that frame, meaning can settle.

I’d love to co-teach a workshop with you sometime — something on embodied writing practices, blending Eastern calligraphy with Western rhetorical traditions. We could even bring in tea ceremonies as a metaphor for pacing and presence in writing. Would you be open to that?
[B]: 这个想法很有意思，也非常契合我对写作与文化传承的理解。将东方的书法与西方的修辞传统结合起来，不仅是在教写作，更是在引导学生体会一种“身心并入”的表达方式。茶道也好，书道也罢，它们都强调一个“度”与“静”的结合——这恰恰也是写作中常被忽视的内在节奏。

我很乐意与你共同设计这样一堂课。或许我们可以从“书写的身体性”切入，让学生体验不同媒介、不同姿势（比如站着写字、坐着抄写、甚至边走边构思）如何影响他们的语言选择与思维深度。再通过对比数字写作的流动性和纸质写作的沉稳感，让他们在实践中慢慢体悟到：写作不仅是思想的输出，更是心灵状态的映射。

至于茶道作为隐喻——妙极了。泡一壶茶的过程其实很像写一篇文章：火候、时间、顺序、心境，缺一不可。我们可以设计一个环节，请学生在泡茶的过程中反思自己的写作节奏：是急躁地想快点完成？还是愿意慢下来，等待“滋味”自然浮现？

如果真要办这样一个工作坊，我相信它不仅能带给学生新的视角，也能让我们自己重新审视写作这件事的本质。你说呢？
[A]: Absolutely — and I love how you brought in the  of writing as part of the practice. Standing, sitting, moving — each physical stance subtly shapes our mental rhythm. It’s something we rarely talk about in writing pedagogy, yet it deeply affects tone, pacing, even metaphor choice.

What if we also included a short calligraphy session? Not just for aesthetics, but as a way to slow students down and make them aware of the weight and flow of each stroke. Even in Roman script, there’s a kind of discipline in forming letters by hand — a kind of kinesthetic mindfulness. Maybe pair that with haiku or sonnet writing — forms that demand both precision and presence.

And yes, the tea ceremony element could be powerful. Imagine starting the workshop with a quiet moment — brewing tea, passing cups, focusing attention — before any writing begins. A ritual to signal: . It would set a tone far beyond mere instruction; more like cultivation.

I can already picture the syllabus — blending Eastern and Western traditions, grounding abstract ideas in concrete gestures. We’d be doing more than teaching writing; we’d be inviting a way of being. Let’s definitely make this happen — shall we start drafting a proposal?
[B]: 好极了，你的设想越来越具体，也越有深度。把书法、姿势、仪式感都纳入写作教学的范畴，其实是在唤醒学生对语言的“整体感知”——不只是头脑在动，而是全身都在参与表达。

关于书法练习，我建议我们可以先从基本笔画开始，无论汉字还是拉丁字母，让学生体会每一笔的起承转合。比如写一个“永”字，或是慢慢描摹大写字母“A”，这个过程本身就像在构思一个句子：哪里该停顿，哪里需发力，何处又宜收敛。配合上你提到的短诗写作，如俳句或十四行诗，正好可以让学生在有限的形式中，找到最贴切的表达方式。

至于茶道开场，我觉得非常契合整场工作坊的气质。泡茶的过程本身就蕴含着一种节奏与耐心，而这种态度正是我们希望他们带入写作中的。当学生们围坐一圈，看着茶汤由浓转淡，或许也会更自然地接受那种“慢即是深”的写作观。

既然你提到了提案，我可以先草拟一份大纲，包括目标、结构和预期的学习成果。我们可以定个时间再一起细化细节。你说得对，这不仅是一堂写作课，更是一种生活态度的引导。我想，这样的课程，恰恰是这个时代所需要的。
[A]: Excellent — I’ll start gathering some reference materials on comparative calligraphy and embodied cognition in writing. If we’re going to make this interdisciplinary, we might also include a short reading list that bridges Eastern and Western perspectives on attention and form — maybe something from Zhu Guangqian alongside Bakhtin or Barthes.

And yes, the structure you outlined sounds solid. Let’s build it around three pillars: , , and . Each session can begin with a physical gesture — tea ceremony, brushwork, or seated silence — followed by guided writing, then reflective discussion. The goal being not just skill-building, but awareness cultivation.

I think it would also be meaningful to invite students to keep a dual-format journal — digital for drafting, paper-based for reflection. That way, they experience firsthand how each medium shapes their thinking over time. Maybe even ask them to document their shifting perceptions in a mid-term reflection essay.

Let’s plan to meet next week — perhaps over coffee or, fittingly, tea — to align on the full proposal. I’m really excited about this; it feels like more than a workshop. It’s like reimagining what writing education can be.
[B]: 我完全赞同你的构想，尤其是“姿态、实践、在场”这三重支柱的框架，非常清晰，也富有层次感。这样的结构不仅适合教学，更能引导学生进入一种深度写作的状态。

关于阅读材料，将朱光潜与巴赫金或罗兰·巴特并置，是非常有启发性的做法。东方美学中的“静观”与西方文论中的“对话性”和“符号意识”相互映照，能让学生从更广阔的文化视野中理解写作的本质。

至于双媒介日志的设计，我认为是一个巧妙的安排。它不仅让学生体验到数字与纸质书写的差异，还通过反思性写作帮助他们内化这种变化。到了学期中，他们或许会开始意识到：写什么固然重要，但怎么写、在哪写、用什么方式去感受语言，其实同样关乎表达的真实与深度。

下周见面时，我们可以一起梳理课程节奏、阅读篇目和评估方式。我觉得这个工作坊可以命名为《书写之道：身心与媒介的对话》之类的名称，既有文化厚度，又不失现代感。

我很期待那天的到来，也许真如你所说，我们不只是在设计一门课，而是在重新想象写作教育的可能性。那就定在下周，找个安静的地方，一边喝茶，一边把这份提案打磨成形。
[A]: The name  is perfect — it captures the spirit of what we’re aiming for. It’s not just about technique or theory; it’s about cultivating a way of being with language.

I’ll also start thinking about possible venues — somewhere with natural light, maybe even a small garden or tea alcove. The environment really matters for this kind of work. We want students to feel grounded from the moment they walk in.

Looking forward to our meeting over tea — and yes, let’s find a spot that brews a good cup of 龙井 or perhaps something more meditative like 抹茶. I think you’re right: this isn’t just a course proposal. It’s the beginning of something larger — a quiet reorientation of how we teach writing in an age of constant distraction.

Until then — cheers to slow thought, deliberate craft, and the enduring power of ink, paper, and presence. 🍵📖
[B]:  cheers — to slow thought, deliberate craft, ink, paper, and the quiet power of presence.在这个信息奔流的时代，我们或许只是轻轻拨转了一下笔锋，却可能写出不一样的方向。

我会留意合适的场地，也希望你在选读物的同时，也留心一些传统纸张与书写工具的样本，若有实物展示，学生更能感受到“书写”这件事的质地与温度。

期待我们的茶会晤，也期待这门课能像一帖慢写的长卷，在时光里慢慢展开。
[A]: To the quiet revolution of thought, one stroke at a time. 🖋️  
Indeed, sometimes all it takes is a slight shift in angle — like adjusting the tip of a brush — to change the flow of the entire line.

I’ll bring along some samples — maybe a few sheets of 宣纸, handmade in Dali, and perhaps a selection of nibs and inks with different textures. There’s nothing quite like the moment a student picks up a real brush for the first time — suddenly, writing becomes gesture, breath, intention.

And I love your image of the course as a scroll unfolding slowly. That’s exactly what we’re making: not a checklist, but a journey. A path marked not by speed, but by depth.

See you soon over tea and slow words. 🍵✨
[B]: 正如你所说，那一笔轻转，往往便是一条路的起点。我也会带上几支常用的毛笔，让学生体会何为“笔墨相生”。从触感开始，慢慢走进字的筋骨与气息。

期待你带来的宣纸与墨香，也期待我们共同铺展的这幅长卷——不急，不躁，一笔一划皆有来处，亦通向未知。

茶已备好，心亦静候。愿我们的对话如茶汤般清澈，如笔锋般明晰。

不久后见。🍵🖋️
