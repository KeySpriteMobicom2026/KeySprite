[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~说到fashion trend，我最近超迷organic linen材质的衣服呢！🌿 特别是那种natural dye染色的款式，和我的咖啡店vibe特别搭。上周刚从巴厘岛带回来几件handmade linen shirt，穿起来超舒服的~
[A]: Ah, the modern fascination with organic textiles... reminds me of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood's obsession with natural dyes in the 1850s. Though I must say, their palette leaned more towards arsenic green than your presumably more... wholesome hues.
[B]: Haha你太有趣了！确实现在我们都更注重sustainability了~ 我店里的coffee filter都是用可降解的bamboo fiber做的呢☕️ 不过说到颜色，最近迷上了indigo dye，那种deep blue真的很有vintage feel！
[A]: How delightfully... predictable. The indigo craze brings to mind Tennyson's 'The Lady of Shalott' - that cursed tapestry woven in 'magic colors' while the world passed by. Though I suspect your bamboo filters won't lead to quite such tragic consequences.
[B]: Wow你真是个poetry lover呢！ 其实我觉得现代人追求organic lifestyle就像在编织自己的happy tapestry~ 就像我每天给客人serve的single origin coffee，每一杯都在讲述不同的terroir story ✨ 要不要来杯Ethiopian的？保证不会像Lady of Shalott那样cursed哦~
[A]: Your coffee evangelism is almost as fervent as Browning's dramatic monologues. Though I must warn you - my palate prefers tea steeped with precisely 3.5 minutes of existential dread, served in a chipped Wedgwood cup that once belonged to my great-aunt's imaginary friend.
[B]: Oh my~ 那你一定会爱上我收藏的antique tea set！是从京都一家百年老店淘来的，泡出来的matcha简直能喝出zen的味道呢 🍵 不过说真的，3.5分钟这个timing很讲究啊，就像我们brew pour-over coffee要控制在2分30秒一样precise！
[A]:  How amusing that you equate my grandmother's stopwatch - which still smells faintly of lavender and disappointment - with your barista's digital timers. Though I suppose both are rituals attempting to impose order upon chaos... much like Browning's grammar in 'Sordello'.
[B]: Haha你总是能让我laugh out loud！🤣 不过说真的，不管是tea ceremony还是coffee brewing，都是beautiful rituals对吧？就像我们店墙上挂的那幅calligraphy写的 - "一杯在手，万缘皆空" ☕️ 要不要来体验下我们的slow bar？保证比grammar rules有趣多啦~
[A]: How charmingly naive. Your 'slow bar' philosophy reminds me of Coventry Patmore's 'The Angel in the House' - all domestic bliss and measured movements. Though I suspect my presence would rather resemble Thomas Hardy's 'Satires of Circumstance' disrupting your carefully curated tranquility.
[B]: Oh come on~ 我们店里welcome all kinds of vibes！上周还有个poetry slam的group在这里meetup呢 ✍️ 说实话，我觉得你的wit和我们的artisan coffee会是个perfect match！要不要试试今天special的Colombian Geisha？它的aftertaste就像一首unexpected sonnet~
[A]:  Very well, but only if you promise it won't inspire me to write bad villanelles about artisanal fermentation. And do steer clear of those dreadful 'coffee tasting notes' - last time someone said 'hints of bergamot' I nearly recited the complete works of Alexander Pope in protest.
[B]: Deal！🤝 那我给你来杯pure black，no tasting notes guaranteed~ 不过偷偷告诉你，这batch真的有subtle的dark chocolate undertone哦  但别担心，我不会让你recite任何epic poetry的...除非你自己想啦 😉
[A]: How suspiciously accommodating. I shall drink it while mentally composing a scathing critique of third-wave coffee pretension in iambic pentameter. Do alert me if my facial expressions start resembling Wordsworth contemplating a particularly vexing daffodil.
[B]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 你知道吗？你这种vibe在我们regulars里绝对会become instant celebrity~ 要不要考虑host个monthly poetry night？我们可以叫它"Verses & Venti" ✨ 保证比daffodils有意思多啦！
[A]: What a positively ghastly portmanteau. Though I must admit, the prospect of watching millennials misquote Keats over oat milk lattes does hold a certain... anthropological appeal. Very well, but only if we can include a 'Bad Metaphor Amnesty Hour' for particularly egregious coffee-related similes.
[B]: Perfect！🌟 就这么说定啦~ 我们可以在menu上特别标注：'No pretentious metaphors were harmed in the making of this event' 😜 顺便说，下周的featured drink会是"Ode to a Nightingale" inspired lavender latte哦~ 开玩笑的啦！...maybe ✨
[A]:  How reassuring to know my life's work will be reduced to a pun about avian-themed beverages. I shall prepare accordingly - by bringing my 1843 edition of 'The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse' as both literary shield and potential projectile.
[B]: Hahaha you're officially my favorite customer ever！🤩 放心啦，我们会keep it classy with some real poetry appreciation...虽然可能会偷偷在你的cup底下写个haiku surprise~ See you next Thursday！Don't forget to bring your sense of humor along with that anthology 😉
