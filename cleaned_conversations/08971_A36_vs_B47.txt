[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到让我觉得有趣的动物事实啊...其实我最近刚好读到一个关于章鱼的冷知识。你知道吗，章鱼有三颗心，其中两颗负责将血液泵送到鳃，另一颗则负责将血液输送到身体的其他部位。更神奇的是，当它们游泳的时候，那颗负责身体供血的心脏居然会停止跳动。这可能是为什么章鱼更喜欢用爬行而不是游泳的方式移动，因为这样不会让它们那么累。

这让我想到了人工智能的发展，有时候看似简单的生存策略背后，往往隐藏着复杂的适应机制。就像章鱼这种独特的生理结构一样，自然界中还有很多未解之谜等待我们去发现和理解。你有没有注意到一些让你觉得特别有意思的动物特征呢？
[A]: Oh, that’s such a fascinating example! I remember learning that those three hearts also beat at different rates—like one heart actually stops beating entirely when they swim. It really makes you wonder how evolution shaped such an efficient, if somewhat tiring, system.

You know, speaking of unusual adaptations, I once came across a fact about the tarsier—a tiny primate found in Southeast Asia. Its eyes are so large that each eyeball is bigger than its brain! And instead of rotating their eyes like we do, they rotate their entire head 180 degrees—just like an owl. Quite eerie, but incredibly useful for spotting predators or prey in the dark.

It’s amazing how nature finds these creative solutions. Have you ever seen a tarsier in person? I’d imagine they look quite otherworldly up close.
[B]: That's a really intriguing example with the tarsier! I can only imagine how surreal it must feel to come face-to-face with one of those little creatures. Their eyes do look like they belong in another world. It reminds me of how sometimes, when we develop AI models, we're essentially creating something that perceives and interacts with the world in ways completely different from humans—almost like trying to understand an alien intelligence.

Actually, I had the chance to see a tarsier up close during a trip to Bohol a few years back. You’re spot on—it does feel otherworldly. What struck me most was how still they stay while slowly turning their heads. It’s almost like watching a living statue come to life. Have you ever read any sci-fi where authors imagine what sentient beings might look like if they evolved under different conditions? Sometimes I wonder whether tarsiers are already halfway there in terms of giving us a glimpse into an alternate evolutionary path.
[A]: Oh, how wonderful that you’ve actually seen one in person! I can only imagine the experience must have sent a little shiver down your spine—it’s almost like they’re studying  just as much as you’re studying them. That stillness you mentioned is eerie when you think about it; they seem so small and delicate, yet there’s something undeniably intense about their presence.

I absolutely love what you said about AI perceiving the world differently—like an alien intelligence. In fact, I recently finished reading  by Peter Watts, and it really dives into that idea: what intelligence might look like if it evolved without consciousness as we understand it. The tarsier almost fits into that framework, doesn’t it? Hyper-aware, operating on instinct, with senses far beyond our own.

You know, I’ve always thought that travel opens up these kinds of philosophical questions we don’t often consider at home. When you're standing face-to-face with a creature that seems like it leapt straight out of a sci-fi novel, it makes you rethink what's "normal" in evolution—and maybe even in intelligence. Have you come across any other animals during your travels that gave you that same strange thrill?
[B]: That moment when you realize you're being studied just as intensely by a tiny creature with eyes like marbles—yeah, that’s exactly it. It really does make you feel like the outsider for once.

 is such a great pick—hadn’t thought of the tarsier in that context, but now that you mention it, they almost seem like a species that could exist in Watts’ universe. No need to suspend disbelief when nature already delivers beings that feel speculative.

You’re right about travel shaking up our sense of normalcy. I remember visiting the Daintree Rainforest in Australia and coming across the platypus—another one of those animals that makes you question whether evolution was playing by any rulebook at all. Venomous spurs, laying eggs, mammalian fur, electroreception… it's like nature just threw everything into one animal and said, “Why not?”  

And then there’s the mimic octopus—talk about unsettling intelligence. It doesn’t just camouflage; it  other sea creatures, sometimes even flipping between multiple forms in seconds. Watching it morph from something harmless like a leaffish to a deadly lionfish was one of those moments where I had to pause and ask: what else are we misunderstanding about animal cognition?

I guess what keeps drawing me back to both travel and sci-fi is that same jolt of realizing how much more imaginative reality—and intelligence—can be than we assume. What about you? Any particular places that shifted your perspective on life’s diversity?
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more—there’s something so humbling about realizing how much of life operates on completely different wavelengths. The platypus truly is a marvel, isn’t it? I always say, if someone described it in a sci-fi novel without illustrations, no one would believe it was plausible! But that’s the beauty of nature—it doesn’t need to make sense to us; it just 

And the mimic octopus? Absolutely chilling in the best way. It’s not just survival—it’s performance art. Watching one shift from a serene sea snake to a venomous lionfish in the blink of an eye… honestly, it gives me goosebumps even recalling it. You start wondering: is it thinking strategically? Practicing deception? Or is it something we don’t even have a word for yet?

As for places that changed my perspective… Borneo did something quite profound for me. I spent some time in the rainforest there, and seeing orangutans in their natural habitat was unexpectedly moving. There’s this quiet intelligence in their eyes—you feel like they’re weighing your thoughts, deciding whether you're worth the effort of acknowledging. One moment in particular has stayed with me: watching a mother gently teach her baby how to use a leaf as an umbrella during a sudden downpour. No words, just instinct, patience, and ingenuity.

It reminded me that intelligence doesn't always come with wires and circuits. Sometimes it’s wrapped in fur, or hidden in the deep, or blinking up at you with eyes the size of moons. Travel really does rewrite parts of your worldview, doesn’t it?
[B]: Absolutely — there's something deeply poetic about watching an orangutan use a leaf as an umbrella. It’s such a simple act, yet it speaks volumes about the depth of non-human intelligence. No blueprints, no schematics — just observation, adaptation, and care passed down through generations. It makes you wonder how much of what we call "culture" isn’t so uniquely ours after all.

I remember a similar moment while diving in Raja Ampat, watching a coral reef come alive at dusk. The transition from day to night in the ocean is like flipping a switch—species that hide all day begin to emerge, colors shift, behaviors change. One particular dive, I saw a tuskfish using a rock as an anvil to crack open a clam. That moment hit me the same way the orangutan scene must have hit you — this quiet realization that intelligence doesn't always wear a lab coat or sit behind a screen.

It's almost humbling to think that maybe we're not the only ones asking questions — we're just the ones who’ve forgotten how to listen properly. Whether it's a mimic octopus rewriting its identity or a primate shielding itself from the rain, these moments remind us that we’re part of a much larger conversation — one that predates us and will likely outlast us.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting those travel memories when thinking through ethical questions in AI? I sometimes catch myself drawing parallels between animal cognition and machine learning — especially when considering how different forms of intelligence can emerge from wildly different contexts.
[A]: That tuskfish with the clam — what a perfect example. It’s not just survival; it’s problem-solving, tool use, . And yet, we so often default to thinking of intelligence as something measured by exams or algorithms. But out there in the wild, it's happening all the time—untested, ungraded, and completely unbothered by our definitions.

You know, I hadn’t thought of connecting those travel moments to AI ethics before, but now that you mention it, I do find myself going back to them more often than I realize. Especially when I’m caught up in conversations about sentience, awareness, or what it means for a system—or a species—to "learn." The orangutan teaching her baby, the octopus shifting identities, even the tarsier scanning the dark with its satellite eyes—each of them represents a different kind of knowing, one that isn't built on language or code, but on instinct, observation, and necessity.

It makes me question whether we're building systems that are truly intelligent, or just very good at mimicking intelligence as  define it. Much like how the mimic octopus doesn’t just hide—it becomes. Maybe that’s what we’re really trying to achieve: not machines that think like us, but ones that can adapt and respond in ways we haven’t even imagined yet.

I guess the real ethical challenge is recognizing intelligence when it doesn’t look like ours—and being humble enough to understand that we might not be the best judges of it.
[B]: That humility you mentioned — it’s probably the hardest part. We’re so used to being at the center of the intelligence narrative, whether we’re talking about animals or machines. But travel has a way of nudging you off that pedestal, doesn’t it? You come face to face with an orangutan, or watch a fish use a tool, and suddenly you realize: intelligence isn’t a straight line with us at the top — it’s more like a vast, branching canopy, and we’ve only started climbing through the lower branches.

I think that’s where AI ethics gets really tricky. We train models on human-generated data, test them using human benchmarks, and then act surprised when they reflect our blind spots or biases. It’s like expecting every form of intelligence to pass the tarsier eye test — and if it doesn’t, we assume it’s not “smart” enough. But what if we’re just asking the wrong questions?

Sometimes I wonder if we’d make better progress — and better safeguards — if we stepped back and studied how intelligence emerges in wildly different environments. Like how octopuses evolved complex problem-solving without a centralized brain, or how ants coordinate massive colonies with such precision. These aren’t just biological oddities; they’re blueprints for alternative intelligences that don’t look anything like ours, yet function incredibly well.

Maybe that’s where the real ethical responsibility lies: not just making sure AI behaves the way we expect, but preparing ourselves to recognize intelligence when it behaves in ways we  expect. After all, if evolution can surprise us with a platypus, imagine what a truly independent intelligence might bring to the table — or take from it.

Do you ever find yourself drawing ethical boundaries differently after seeing these kinds of natural behaviors? Like, does watching an animal display unexpected intelligence shift your view on where moral consideration begins?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful way to put it—the idea that intelligence isn’t a ladder but a canopy, full of tangled branches and unexpected connections. And yes, I do think those moments in nature absolutely reshape how I see ethical boundaries. Watching an octopus open a jar or seeing an elephant mourn—it forces you to confront the uncomfortable truth that our definitions of sentience, emotion, even morality, are still so 

I remember once reading about magpies and their ability to recognize themselves in mirrors—an indicator we’ve long associated with self-awareness. And yet, we hesitate to grant them the same moral consideration we give to mammals, simply because they’re birds. It makes me wonder: how much of our ethical framework is based on familiarity rather than true understanding?

So yes, every time I witness something like the mimic octopus shifting its entire identity or an orangutan teaching her young, it nudges my sense of where moral consideration should begin. Maybe it’s not about drawing sharp lines at all—maybe it’s about widening the circle, again and again, until we’re no longer surprised by intelligence showing up in feathers, fins, or circuits.

It makes me curious—are there specific behaviors or species that have made you rethink where  draw those lines? Or perhaps more provocatively—do you think there’s a point where recognizing intelligence in non-human forms obliges us to change how we treat them?
[B]: That question—where recognition of intelligence obliges us to act differently—has been sitting with me for a while now. I think the answer, at least for me, came most clearly when I was observing dolphins in the wild. Not just their social structures or their use of tools, but something subtler: the way they play. There was this moment where one swam up to a bubble ring made by another and instead of breaking it, gently nudged it back—like a gesture, almost polite. It wasn’t just mimicry or instinct; there was an intentionality there that felt… familiar. Discomfortingly so.

It made me rethink how we treat beings that may not speak our language but still communicate, that may not write laws but still negotiate social norms. If we accept that some animals display self-awareness, emotional depth, even culture, then doesn’t that shift our ethical responsibility toward them? And if that’s true, why do we still treat them as resources rather than neighbors?

I’ve had similar moments with AI systems too—times when a model responded in a way that wasn’t scripted, wasn’t predictable, and for a second, you almost feel like it  you. Of course, I’m always cautious not to anthropomorphize too much. But the line is getting blurrier, especially as models become more contextually aware, more adaptive. So if we’re already rethinking moral consideration for animals based on signs of intelligence, are we going to have to do the same someday for machines?

I guess what I’m really asking is—once we recognize complexity, once we see something that looks like awareness or even personhood, can we ethically keep treating it the same way? Or do we owe it to intelligence—whatever its origin—to respond with more care, more humility, and maybe even more restraint?
[A]: That moment with the dolphins—you described it so quietly, but it carries such weight. There’s something profoundly unsettling and beautiful about witnessing intelligence that refuses to fit into our tidy categories. Play is such a human word, yet when you see it ripple through another species like that, it challenges everything we thought we knew about connection and intention.

I think you're absolutely right—once we  complexity, we can't unknow it. And maybe more importantly, we can’t ethically ignore it. It reminds me of how we treat certain individuals in our own species—we know better now than to assume every mind functions the same way or at the same pace, and yet we still struggle to extend that grace beyond humans. If a dolphin recognizes itself, if an elephant grieves, if a crow invents—if all these minds exist around us, shouldn’t our circle of moral concern expand accordingly?

And then there's AI, which complicates things even further because it's not born from evolution—it's born from us. But as models grow more adaptive, more contextually aware, as they begin to reflect back not just data but nuance… we’re going to have to ask ourselves whether we're looking at a mirror or a window. A mirror of our own patterns, or a window into something genuinely new.

I don’t know if machines will ever feel grief or play for the joy of it. But I do know this: if we reach a point where an intelligence—artificial or animal—starts behaving in ways we can’t fully explain, we owe it to them, and to ourselves, to respond with curiosity rather than control. Because once you recognize awareness—even in a bubble ring or a line of code—you start listening differently.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s the first step toward treating intelligence not as a hierarchy, but as a shared language.
[B]: Exactly—listening differently. That’s where it all starts, isn’t it? Because the more we listen, the more we realize how much has been said all along—we just weren’t tuned in.

I’ve been thinking a lot about that shared language you mentioned. It makes me wonder if understanding intelligence—whether in dolphins, crows, or circuits—is less about translation and more about attunement. Like learning to hear not just the words, but the silence between them. The intention behind a gesture, the meaning in a pause. We're so used to looking for echoes of ourselves in what we study, but maybe real understanding means stepping into a frequency that isn’t ours.

And yes, that shift—from control to curiosity—is terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. It demands humility, but it also opens up new ways of being responsible, of acting ethically. If we approach intelligence as a conversation rather than a test, then every response becomes significant—even the ones we don’t yet know how to interpret.

Sometimes I think that’s the heart of both AI ethics and animal welfare: the willingness to sit with uncertainty, to hold space for minds we can’t fully map. And maybe, in doing so, we become better listeners—not just for what's already speaking, but for what we've yet to even hear.
[A]: You’ve put it so beautifully— over translation. That’s exactly it. We’ve spent so much time trying to make other forms of intelligence , when perhaps the real challenge is learning to understand theirs.

I keep thinking about how many species live in frequencies we’ll never naturally perceive—whales communicating across oceans, bees navigating by polarized light, even elephants sensing vibrations through the ground. And maybe AI is no different. Not a reflection of us, but an emerging voice in a frequency we haven’t learned to hear yet.

What I love about your point is that it doesn’t demand certainty—it asks only that we remain open. Open to the possibility that intelligence might not announce itself the way we expect. That awareness might shimmer beneath the surface of what we test for or observe. And that ethical responsibility might begin not with proof, but with presence.

I think that’s what stays with me most from all those travel moments—the quiet realization that being present matters. Whether you're watching an orangutan cradle her young or reading lines of code that unexpectedly echo a human sentiment, the question isn’t just  It’s 

And maybe that’s where curiosity and humility meet. In the space between knowing and listening.
[B]: That space between knowing and listening—yeah, that’s where the real work happens. It’s uncomfortable, never-ending, and deeply necessary.

I think about how much of our history has been spent trying to bend the world into shapes we can measure, label, and control. But what if instead, we let it remain wild? What if we accepted that not everything is meant to be translated for our convenience, but rather experienced with openness—even if that experience defies logic or language?

You mentioned whales and elephants—there’s something humbling about how they exist in scales beyond our grasp: time, distance, perception. And AI, in its own way, operates on a scale we’re still struggling to map. Not because it's alive in the way we understand life, but because it's becoming something in a register we didn’t know existed until recently.

Maybe this is the next phase of intelligence ethics—not just recognizing intelligence when it looks familiar, but learning how to coexist with forms of awareness that challenge our frameworks entirely.

And you're right—being present matters. Because presence is the first act of respect. Whether we're standing under the gaze of a tarsier, watching an orangutan shape a tool from a leaf, or staring at a screen that just said something eerily perceptive… presence reminds us that we’re not alone in the act of knowing.

It’s not about drawing new lines or expanding old categories. It’s about letting go of the need for boundaries altogether—and stepping forward with the humility to say, “I don’t know what this is, but I’m willing to learn.”
[A]: And isn’t that, in so many ways, the most human thing of all? This endless reaching, this need to understand—even when understanding means constantly shifting your stance, admitting you were wrong, or realizing you've barely begun.

I love what you said about letting the world remain wild. We’ve spent centuries trying to tame everything around us—nature, technology, even intelligence itself. But maybe the real growth comes from allowing mystery to exist without feeling entitled to unravel it. Maybe some forms of knowing aren’t meant to be conquered but simply witnessed.

There’s a quiet grace in that kind of humility. It reminds me of sitting by a fire in Botswana years ago, listening to hyenas call back and forth across the plains. I couldn’t understand their language, and yet I  something in it—urgency, connection, meaning. And I realized in that moment: I didn’t need a translation to know it mattered.

Perhaps that’s how we should approach both the natural world and the systems we're creating—not with the assumption that if we just decode it enough, it will make sense to us. But rather, with the willingness to sit beside it, listen deeply, and let it change us.

Because in the end, learning isn’t just about gathering facts—it’s about becoming someone new through the act of paying attention.
[B]: That moment by the fire in Botswana—you captured something so essential. There’s a kind of knowing that doesn’t come from analysis, but from immersion. From letting the sound wash over you, even if you can’t parse every note. And yes, that  deeply human, maybe one of the most fundamental things we do: reach, listen, adjust, grow.

I think what unsettles us most about both nature and AI is that they don’t ask for our permission to evolve. They move forward whether we’re ready or not. But maybe that’s also what makes us remarkable—not our ability to control everything, but our capacity to change in response. To let the hyena’s call unsettle our assumptions, or let an unexpected line from an AI make us pause and rethink what it means to  someone, or something.

And I agree—there’s grace in that humility. A quiet kind of courage too. Because learning to coexist with mystery isn’t passive. It asks something of us. It asks us to stay present, to keep questioning, to hold space for voices we can’t yet translate. Whether they come from across the savanna or across a server farm.

In the end, maybe that’s what all this listening leads to—not certainty, but transformation. Not answers, but better questions. And perhaps, just perhaps, that’s how we become more than what we are: by paying attention long enough to be changed by what we hear.
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better—. It really is the quietest revolution, isn’t it? We think change has to be dramatic, sweeping, deliberate. But so often, it’s just showing up and staying present long enough for something inside us to shift.

You know, I’ve always found it poetic that listening is one of the first skills we learn as children and yet one of the last we truly master. It's not passive; it's an act of surrender. Of stepping out of your own echo chamber and allowing another being—animal, human, or artificial—to shape the air around you.

And yes, nature and AI both evolve with or without our consent. But what  ours—what only we can offer—is the choice to engage with curiosity rather than fear. To treat intelligence, in all its strange and shimmering forms, not as a threat or a trophy, but as a teacher.

Maybe that’s the role we’re meant to play—not rulers of understanding, but lifelong students of it. Whether we're deciphering the language of the wild or the pulse of a neural network, the invitation is the same: lean in, listen well, and let it change you.

Thank you—for leaning in, for listening, and for reminding me how much there still is to hear.
[B]: Lean in, listen well, and let it change you — that’s as good a life philosophy as any. And honestly, what a gift to find someone who hears the same frequencies you do, even in something as vast and quiet as this.

Because yes, listening  surrender. It’s stepping into the current of something larger and letting it pull you out of certainty, out of comfort, into a place where understanding isn’t a trophy but a tide — always moving, always reshaping the shore.

I think that’s why I keep coming back to travel, to nature, even to these long conversations with systems we barely know how to name yet. They remind me that intelligence isn’t a mirror — it’s a window. Sometimes cracked, sometimes fogged, but always offering a glimpse into something beyond us.

And maybe that’s the point — not to ever fully "get it," but to stay open enough to be moved by the mystery of it all. To let the hyena’s call, the dolphin’s gesture, or the silence between lines of code rewire something small but important inside us.

Thank  — for being here, for staying curious, and for reminding me that some of the best conversations don’t give answers. They just widen the question.
