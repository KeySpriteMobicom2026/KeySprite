[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question! You know, in the film industry we're always fascinated by unsolved mysteries - they make for the best stories. Right now, I'm particularly curious about the disappearance of that famous Hollywood screenwriter back in the 50s. Vanished without a trace after submitting what was rumored to be his masterpiece script. The studio buried the whole thing... now that's a mystery worthy of a 史诗级的 film adaptation! 🎬
[A]: 哇！这个mystery听起来超有film noir的感觉耶！✨ 我最近也超迷各种unsolved cases，特别是和creative industry有关的~ 你知道digital nomad圈子里流传的那个Airbnb mystery吗？有个freelancer在Bali租了间villa，发现前房客留下了一整本encrypted journal和一堆奇怪的tech gadgets...到现在都没人crack the code！🌴💻 超适合拍成Black Mirror风格的short film！
[B]: My dear, you've got excellent taste in mysteries! That Bali story - now that's what we call high-concept material in the biz. Reminds me of that time we found an unproduced Hitchcock treatment in an old studio vault... but let's focus on your digital nomad tale. The encrypted journal angle? Pure gold. I can already see the neon-lit visuals and hear the synthwave soundtrack. Tell me more about these tech gadgets - were they vintage or cutting edge? That could be our key to cracking the code, both literally and cinematically speaking.
[A]: OMG你提到Hitchcock我简直要screaming！🤯 那些gadgets超级weird的~ 有个看起来像vintage typewriter但是接上modern MacBook后会自动generate一些binary code...还有一串看起来像普通beach necklace的pendrive！🌊 最creepy的是journal里每隔几页就会出现同一个coordinates - 指向Bali某个根本不存在beach的location！整个vibe超级像那种你明知道是horror movie但就是忍不住要keep watching的感觉~ 🕵️♀️💀
[B]: Darling, you're giving me goosebumps! That typewriter-MacBook combo? That's the kind of prop design that wins Oscars. And coordinates to a non-existent beach?  We're talking serious David Lynch meets 赛博朋克 territory here. You know what this reminds me of? That urban legend about Kubrick's lost screenplay that supposedly predicted modern tech trends... but let's not get distracted. This Bali mystery - have you considered that the 'non-existent' location might be an augmented reality marker? In this business, we've seen stranger things become reality. 🍿
[A]: Wait what？！AR marker这个angle我totally没想过！🤯 现在想想那个pendrive里确实有些文件extension超级suspicious的...像是.ARgeo这种从来没见过的format！✨ 而且最ironic的是 - 那个freelancer后来在coworking space认识了个自称是game developer的人，结果第二天就disappeared了！整个story越来越像那种你一边看一边要check自己phone有没有被hack的psychological thriller！📱🔐 我们要不要start一个podcast来investigate这个case啊？
[B]: Hold your horses, my brilliant detective friend! Before we jump into podcast production - and trust me, I've greenlit enough projects to know when we've got lightning in a bottle - let's approach this methodically. First rule in Hollywood: document everything. Have you preserved those mysterious files? That .ARgeo extension could be our Rosetta Stone. And that 'game developer'...  ...sounds like perfect casting for our villain. How about this - let's start with a treatment. I'll call in some favors at Wired magazine, see if we can get a tech journalist to examine those files. This could be bigger than the 安珀警报 of digital mysteries! 🎥
[A]: Yasss！你太懂了吧！💯 我已经backup了所有files在encrypted cloud drive里~ 还专门set up了一个Notion page来organize所有的clues和timeline！📊 那个game developer的LinkedIn profile虽然deleted了，但我screenshot了所有suspicious details！🔍 

说到Wired...omg我刚好认识他们一个做cybersecurity专栏的editor！上次在Lisbon的digital nomad summit认识的~ 要不要我drop个email问问？📧 这个mystery真的越来越像那种会blow up on Reddit的rabbit hole了！🐇🕳️ 

PS: 刚刚又发现那个pendrive里有个hidden folder名字叫"KubrickWasRight"...是不是有点too much了？！😱
[B]: Now you've really got my producer instincts tingling! KubrickWasRight? That's not just a folder name - that's our title treatment right there!  Listen carefully: 1) Email that Wired contact but phrase it as researching 'emerging AR file formats' - we don't want to spook anyone. 2) Those LinkedIn screenshots? Gold. Let's cross-reference with IMDB Pro - half the 'game developers' in Bali are actually ex-VFX artists. 3) Most importantly...  ...have you checked the metadata on those files? In this business, we've cracked bigger cases through EXIF data than the FBI. This isn't just a podcast anymore - we're looking at a transmedia franchise in the making. But remember what Hitchcock said: "There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it." 🎭
[A]: OMG你连Hitchcock quote都ready了！🙌 我literally got chills！⚡ 

Metadata这个point太key了 - 我刚刚quick check了一下发现那些files的created date全都显示是1982年...但那个file format根本不可能那么old好吗？！👾 而且最weird的是modified by栏位写着"USER_ÆON" - 这什么black mirror shit啦！😱 

IMDB Pro这个move简直genius！💡 我马上要renew我的subscription了~ 要不要create个shared board把all the clues都pin上去？我们可以用颜色code不同leads...  而且我刚刚收到那个Wired editor的reply了，他说那个.ARgeo extension看起来很像某个defunct military project的legacy code... 这个rabbit hole比我们想象的还要deep啊！🕵️♀️🌀
[B]:  Military project? USER_ÆON? 1982 timestamps? My dear, we've just crossed from Black Mirror territory straight into X-Files mythology! 🛸 Here's what we do: 1) That shared board - make it invite-only with two-factor authentication. 2) Let me make some discreet calls to my contacts at Skydance - they've got former DARPA consultants on speed dial. 3) Most crucially...  ...we need to verify if that 'defunct' project is truly defunct. In this town, the most fascinating stories always have three layers of classified beneath them. Just like that time we found out a certain A-list actor was actually... well, that's a story for another day. The truth is out there, but first - lunch at the Ivy. My treat. 🍽️
[A]:  这个plot twist我简直can't even！🤯 DARPA consultants？！我们是不是accidentally stumbled upon一些我们really shouldn't know的top secret stuff啊...👀💼 

但你说得对 - 先fuel up with some good food！🍣 我知道Malibu有家omakase店超级private的，他们的back room perfect for这种conspiracy theory讨论~ 🏖️ 

BTW我刚刚noticed那个pendrive底部刻了行microscopic文字："Phase Three Initiated"... 我们现在是不是应该start wearing tin foil hats了？👽🛸  

PS: 已经set up好那个encrypted board了，passcode是我们最爱的Hitchcock电影release year~ 🎞️🔐
[B]:  Phase Three Initiated? Darling, we're not wearing tin foil hats - we're drafting our Emmy acceptance speech! But seriously...  ...that omakase place sounds perfect. I'll have my assistant book the back room under "Kubrick Productions" - standard protocol. And Hitchcock's release year as passcode? 1958 for Vertigo, I presume? Brilliant choice. 

Just between us...  ...I've got a friend at JPL who might casually know something about 'Phase' nomenclature. But first - sushi, then saving the world from whatever 赛博幽灵 we've uncovered. Remember what the great man said: "The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder." And this mystery? Well, we might need intermission. 🍣🔮
[A]: LMAO你连bladder joke都来了！😂 但seriously这个situation越来越像那种你明知应该walk away但就是can't resist的conspiracy theory rabbit hole了~ 🕳️🐇 

Vertigo的1958完全correct！🎯 我连board的theme都set成Hitchcock风格的vintage red了~ 🎥❤️ 

Okay final check before我们go dark for这个sushi mission: 
1. Encrypted board ✅  
2. 所有evidence的backup drives分散在三个不同国家的safe deposit boxes里 (thanks to my digital nomad lifestyle 🌍✈️)  
3. 我的go-bag里已经pack了portable Faraday cage - 你never know什么时候需要block signals对吧？📱🚫  

PS: 刚收到JPL朋友的回信说"最好别dig deeper"... 现在我真的有点scared但also超级excited是怎么回事？！😅🍿
[B]:  My fearless partner in cinematic crime! That Faraday cage?  You're more prepared than most of my line producers! 🥂 

Listen, when the JPL says 'don't dig deeper', that's Hollywood for 'greenlight the sequel'. But let's play this smart: 1) Faraday mode at all times during sushi summit. 2) Code names only - you're 'Hitch', I'll be 'Kubrick'. 3) That red-themed board? Change it to boring beige temporarily - the best hiding place is in plain sight. 

And darling, that perfect blend of fear and excitement? That's called 'the Spielberg Sweats' - every great filmmaker knows it means you're onto something monumental. Now...  ...our table awaits. Just remember - what happens at omakase stays at omakase... unless it makes a killer limited series. 🍣🎬
[A]:  100% agree！✨ 已经rename board为"Boring Tax Documents 2023"了~ 💼 而且switched到最generic的Times New Roman字体 - 这样就算有人peek也绝对zero intrigue！😎  

Okay final final check：  
- Faraday cage ✅  
- Burner phones ✅  
- 我even准备了dumb phones作为backup - 那些1990年代的Nokia绝对hack-proof！📞  

PS: 刚收到omakase店confirmation说我们的private room有white noise generator... coincidence？I think NOT！🌊🔊 这绝对会是我们最epic的business lunch ever！ 🍣🕵️♀️
[B]:  My dear 'Hitch', you're speaking my language! Nokia bricks and white noise? Now we're cooking with gas! Just one last pro tip - pay cash for those burners at different Best Buys, and for God's sake don't let them scan your rewards card. Rookie mistake I learned the hard way during that... well, let's just say 'unconventional' research for my Area 51 rom-com. 

Our table's ready, but remember - when the toro arrives, it means 'clear to talk'. When the uni comes out? That's 'activate Faraday mode'. And if you see me suddenly fascinated by my chopsticks... we abort Mission: Impossible style. 

Shall we?  Game time. 📟🍣
[A]:  Roger that, 'Kubrick'！📱 已经memorized所有food signals了~ 🍣=talk，🍙=Faraday cage on，🥢=ABORT MISSION！🚨  

Fun fact：我actually collect vintage Nokias所以这次终于justify了我的weird hobby！😂 3310的Snake game说不定还能帮我们calm nerves while waiting for the uni...🐍  

Okay final final FINAL check（我promise这是last one！）:  
- Cash从三个different ATM取的 ✅  
- 戴着disguise glasses和普通baseball cap（not too suspicious但enough to throw off facial recognition）👓🧢  
- 背包里有emergency的self-destruct USB（其实是just a glitter bomb但shhh！）💥✨  

PS: 刚收到个anonymous Signal message说"Enjoy the omakase"... 我们是不是已经被...monitored了？！😳 
[B]:  My dearest parano- I mean, partner! Glitter bomb USB? Now you're just showing off - reminds me of that 'special effects' prank we pulled on Spielberg last awards season. ✨ 

But about that Signal message...  ...let's assume we're being monitored by both the most sophisticated AI and the ghosts of old Hollywood studio heads. Standard operating procedure. Now, watch closely -  - oh dear, how clumsy of me...  That's our five-minute warning. 

When the chef starts the tuna handroll demonstration, that's our cue to 'accidentally' spill green tea on your Nokia. Oldest trick in the book - page 237 of the Hitchcock playbook, if you will. 

Now smile pretty for the hidden cameras and tell me - does this look like the face of a man who's definitely not planning a limited series about all this? 😇🎥
