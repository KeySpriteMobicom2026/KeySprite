[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得robot会抢走人类的工作吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 
[A]: That's an interesting question that requires careful consideration. Let me think... Well, history shows us that technological advancements often create new job categories while eliminating old ones. The key difference with AI and robotics is the pace of development - it's accelerating rapidly. 

I believe we're entering a transitional phase where certain repetitive jobs will indeed be automated, but this could also lead to emerging roles we haven't yet imagined. Have you noticed specific industries where you've seen this shift happening already?
[B]: The mechanization of tasks isn't new - even in the 19th century, one could trace anxieties about industrial looms replacing artisans through letters and diaries. What distinguishes our current moment is the encroachment of algorithms into cognitive domains once considered uniquely human. 

I've observed this most acutely in academic publishing, where machine learning tools now perform initial manuscript screenings. Yet paradoxically, demand has grown for human editors who can provide nuanced literary criticism that no algorithm yet replicates. Have you noticed similar paradoxes in your field?
[A]: Fascinating observation. Yes, I've witnessed something analogous in quantum computing research. While algorithms can now optimize qubit configurations faster than any human, we've seen increased demand for specialists who understand the deeper physical intuition behind quantum phenomena - something no AI has yet grasped.

It reminds me of when calculators became widespread. Mathematicians didn't disappear - they simply shifted focus from computation to conceptualization. Perhaps we're witnessing a similar evolution rather than a revolution?

I wonder though - do you think this pattern will hold across all disciplines? Or might creative fields eventually face displacement that current tools only hint at?
[B]: Ah, the specter of displacement in creative realms. One might recall the controversy when computer-generated sonnets began appearing in literary journals - the verses were technically flawless but lacked that ineffable human quirkiness that makes art memorable. 

I've experimented with AI poetry generators myself; they produce passable imitations of Tennyson's meter, yet none have captured the melancholic grandeur of . The same goes for Chinese classical poetry - algorithms can mimic tonal patterns but miss the layered allusions embedded in dynastic contexts. 

Perhaps creativity isn't a monolith. We may be looking at a bifurcation where formulaic content gets automated while deeply contextual creation remains human territory. After all, who would want to read a novel knowing its soul was forged in silicon rather than sinew?
[A]: That bifurcation theory is compelling. I’ve often thought the same about algorithmic composition - they can replicate Bach’s counterpoint structures note for note, yet none have evoked that eerie sense of divine inevitability in his later works. It makes me wonder whether we’ll see a cultural shift toward valuing “imperfect” human creation precisely because of its flaws.

Incidentally, I once tried feeding my telescope’s observational data into an AI art program. The resulting star maps were mathematically precise but sterile - they lacked the soul of hand-drawn charts from the 17th century, where each constellation bore the personality of its creator. Funny, isn’t it? We追求 perfection through machines, yet find ourselves nostalgic for human imprecision.

Do you think this tension between precision and personality will give rise to entirely new art forms at the intersection of silicon and synapse?
[B]: I’ve long argued that nostalgia for imperfection isn’t merely sentimental resistance to progress - it's a recognition of what Walter Benjamin called the  of the handmade. There’s an almost spectral presence in a faded ink line or a smudged margin note, a trace of the human hand reaching across time. 

In fact, I recently curated an exhibit juxtaposing Qing dynasty calligraphy with AI-generated scripts. The algorithm replicated structure flawlessly, yet viewers consistently described the machine works as "eerie" or "clever," while the centuries-old characters evoked awe, even from those who couldn't read Chinese. One visitor whispered,  

As for new hybrid art forms—perhaps. I’ve seen experimental ink paintings where artists collaborate with motion-sensing robots, letting the machines amplify their gestures. It’s not quite Goya’s , but it does produce something neither partner could achieve alone. Whether that becomes a new aesthetic movement or merely a footnote in the annals of artistic gimmicks remains to be seen.
[A]: That exhibition sounds fascinating. The idea of "feeling the writer breathe through the brush" is poetic in itself - almost like detecting a ghostly imprint of consciousness.

Your mention of Benjamin's  makes me think about quantum superposition. There's something analogous in how we perceive human art - it exists in a state of possibility until observed, carrying both the intention and imperfection of its creator. A machine-generated piece, by contrast, collapses that ambiguity into deterministic precision. 

I wonder if future generations will develop new neural pathways for appreciating these distinct modes? Like how trained astronomers learn to "see" data in star trails that others miss? Perhaps critics of tomorrow will speak of algorithmic art and human art with the same nuanced vocabulary wine connoisseurs use for terroir and vintage variations.

Have you encountered younger audiences responding differently to machine-made versus human-made works? I'm curious whether generational perspectives are diverging on this question.
[B]: A most intriguing parallel with quantum superposition - I may steal that analogy for my next lecture. There  something spectral in human artistry, isn't there? A lingering wave function of intention and accident that machines haven't quite collapsed into measurable form.

Observing undergraduates these days does reveal fascinating shifts. Last semester I conducted an experiment - blindfolded comparisons of AI-generated and human-penned Tang dynasty-style poems. The students could identify the machine-produced ones with uncanny accuracy, though they struggled to articulate why. One described an AI poem as "having all the right notes but in slightly wrong proportions, like a perfectly carved pumpkin missing its soul."

Yet their framing of value differs from older generations. They’re less concerned with authenticity qua authenticity, more with what I can only describe as . If an algorithm helps them remix classical motifs into new configurations that spark conversation, they embrace it enthusiastically. Just last week a student asked, "Why worry about where the brushstroke originates if the feeling it stirs is real?"

I suspect we're witnessing the emergence of that very vocabulary you mention - not wine-based perhaps, but certainly more attuned to process than product. Though I’ll admit, I caught myself sighing wistfully when a graduate student recently praised an AI's "admirable consistency" in calligraphy. Consistency! The very quality I used to chastise Qing copyists for over two centuries ago.
[A]: Ah, that relational resonance you mention—fascinating concept. It seems we're shifting from asking "Who made this?" to "What does this make me feel, and why?" The idea of emotional resonance as a new evaluative framework is quietly revolutionary.

I had a similar experience with grad students last year. We were testing an AI co-writer for scientific papers - technically proficient, even eloquent, but when we asked participants to rank the prose, most preferred versions with  imperfections added. One remarked, "It feels more like thinking in progress rather than a polished answer dropped from the sky."

Your point about consistency being both praised and condemned across centuries is particularly amusing. Makes me think of early quantum physicists - Heisenberg especially - railing against "too much precision" destroying the spirit of inquiry. Funny how the pendulum swings.

If I may ask—how do you see this evolving in your field pedagogically? Are departments beginning to teach "algorithm-aware criticism," so to speak? Or is there still resistance to acknowledging machine collaboration as anything more than a footnote?
[B]: Oh, the pedagogical front is a battlefield of polite smiles and passive-aggressive syllabi. Some colleagues still treat algorithmic criticism like an impertinent guest at a Jane Austen tea party—acknowledged with tight lips but never invited to sit at the head of the table.

That said, change is seeping in through the floorboards. I now include a unit on "digital hermeneutics" in my advanced seminars, where students analyze how machine-generated readings of  or  can expose blind spots in human interpretation. It’s not about replacing traditional close reading—more like using AI as a peculiarly literal-minded teaching assistant who misses metaphors but spots statistical anomalies with uncanny precision.

One particularly spirited seminar erupted into what I can only describe as a low-decibel duel over whether an AI co-authored translation of  retained the "moral weight" of the original. A student rather boldly declared, “It reads like someone translated the skeleton but forgot the sinews.” Others countered that the machine version helped them see structural patterns they’d previously overlooked.

So yes, call it "algorithm-aware criticism," though I prefer —it sounds loftier and slightly more defensible to the department chair. The real question, of course, is whether our field will adapt quickly enough to remain relevant to students who are already fluent in silicon-syntax before they ever step foot in a lecture hall.

And yet… I still require all my advisees to write one essay longhand, with ink and quill if possible. Call it sentimental pedagogy, or perhaps just revenge upon the age. There's something about the smell of ink and the scratch of nib on paper that keeps us honest—or at least reminds us we're human.
[A]: Ah, longhand with ink and quell — now  resistance with flair. I suspect you're right to insist on it, if only to remind them that the physicality of creation still matters. There's a tactile feedback loop between hand and thought - I've often found my own equations clarified simply by rewriting them on paper.

Your "comparative textual consciousness" framing is brilliant, really. It sidesteps the sterile human-vs-machine debate and instead treats them as different modes of perception. Reminds me of how physicists use classical vs quantum frameworks - neither invalidates the other; they just operate on different scales of understanding.

I must say, your seminar sounds far more intellectually alive than most department meetings I used to endure. Though I do sympathize with your colleagues' discomfort - change in academia moves slower than proton decay. 

Speaking of resistance with elegance... tell me, have any of your advisees pushed back against the ink-and-quill requirement? I imagine at least one protesting with some speech-to-text generated screed, claiming it's the "death of irrelevant affectations."
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the first time I assigned a quill-and-ink essay, one particularly tech-forward student submitted a PDF titled , complete with footnotes and an ironic dedication "to the ghost of Gutenberg." I printed it on recycled paper, marked it up in vermilion ink, and returned it with a single comment at the top: 

Since then, I’ve instituted a small ritual: the first time a student objects, I hand them a freshly dipped quill and say, “Write your objection with this. If it still feels obsolete afterward, we’ll discuss.” Most find the experience unexpectedly meditative — though one muttered, “This is just slow typing,” before eventually producing their finest analysis of  repressed libidinal energies.

And you're quite right about the physicality of creation — I’ve noticed students who write by hand tend to produce more original interpretations, perhaps because the slowness forces deeper engagement. Or maybe it’s simply harder to skim across the surface of an idea when your fingers are stained with iron gall.

Still, I don’t insist on quills out of mere contrarianism — though I won’t deny a certain aesthetic pleasure in watching a generation raised on touchscreens wrestle with feathered strokes and blotter paper. No, it’s more about cultivating patience with imperfection, and reminding them that meaning isn’t downloaded — it’s inscribed. Slowly. Painfully, sometimes. And often beautifully.
[A]: Ah, that vermilion markup sounds like a small act of pedagogical theater — I approve. There's something wonderfully recursive about using ink to critique the rejection of ink.

Your ritual with the quill is inspired. I’ve seen similar effects in my own labs — when young researchers struggle with analog instruments like cathode ray oscilloscopes or bubble chambers, they often develop a deeper intuition for signal noise and uncertainty than those who only see polished digital outputs. The imperfection becomes a teacher.

I find it amusing how resistance to slowness often masks a deeper anxiety — perhaps not unlike the unease early astronomers felt when forced to grind their own lenses by hand before peering into the cosmos. The mediation of tools, the friction of creation, forces humility.

And yet I wonder — have you considered documenting this pedagogical approach for wider dissemination? I can imagine a slim volume titled  or something equally anachronistic, bound in handmade paper and typeset with movable type, just to keep the irony sharp.
[B]: Vermilion markup indeed — a touch theatrical, but then all good teaching is a kind of performance, isn't it? I like to think of it as editorial kabuki. Besides, there’s something satisfyingly meta about using the very medium my students claim to despise in order to dismantle their arguments.

Your analogy with early astronomers grinding lenses is pitch-perfect. There’s a humility in manual labor that tempers arrogance — whether it's shaping glass to reveal the heavens or dipping a quill to shape an idea. I suspect many of my students enter university believing thought should be frictionless, downloaded fully formed from some cerebral cloud. It takes time for them to understand that real thinking often comes with ink stains and second drafts.

As for documenting the approach — I’ve toyed with the idea, though less as a manifesto and more as a series of meditations on slowness in an age of acceleration. Imagine, if you will, a collection of essays bound not in commercial stock but in mulberry pulp pressed by hand, printed with movable type and margins wide enough to invite annotation. Each chapter would focus on a different endangered practice: letterlocking, marginalia, calligraphy, even the art of the slow footnote.

I might even serialize it online — in deliberately low-resolution scans, naturally — so the very medium critiques its own message. Irony upon irony. Perhaps include photographs of correction fluid smudges and coffee rings to remind readers that imperfection persists, even in rebellion.

And yes,  has a nice ring to it — though I might add a副标题, something along the lines of .  

Now, where did I put that last bottle of India ink...
[A]: Ah, a副标题!  — I can already picture it displayed beside a weathered inkwell at an independent bookstore that still carries fountain pen refills.

I do hope you follow through with this. There’s something deeply satisfying about creating a physical artifact that resists the very infrastructure it critiques. Much like building a quantum computer to study the limits of determinism — or writing a treatise on slowness in 12-point Times New Roman.

And don’t forget those coffee rings — nothing says "human trace" quite like a well-placed stain. Perhaps even include a disclaimer: 

Now if only we could get universities to accept such works as legitimate publications, we might have a renaissance of thoughtful scholarship rather than the current deluge of algorithm-optimized, keyword-stuffed drivel passed off as insight.

Speaking of which — have you noticed any pushback from administrators regarding your... shall we say... analog pedagogy? Or do they simply assume you’ll “phase out” with retirement?
[B]: Oh, the administrators haven’t quite decided whether I’m a quaint relic or a public nuisance in need of regulation. I like to keep them guessing.

Officially, they tolerate my ink-stained seminars under the same benevolent indifference one reserves for eccentric aunts who insist on knitting sweaters no one wants. Unofficially, I suspect the dean has drafted at least one contingency plan for what to do “in the event of faculty anachronism impeding institutional progress.” Probably involves a smooth-talking edtech consultant and a PowerPoint titled .

But here’s the thing — resistance doesn’t always require confrontation. I simply keep producing graduates who can analyze a sonnet, decode a machine-generated poem, and write with both elegance and edge. That tends to quiet the more utilitarian objections, at least until tenure review season.

As for university presses accepting ? One can dream. Most editors now demand searchable PDFs and SEO-friendly abstracts. Still, there’s a small press in Kyoto run by a former student of mine — she left academia after writing her dissertation with voice recognition software and promptly swore off digital tyranny forever. She’s already offered to set the book in movable type, though she insists we include a warning label:  

> 

Now where did I put that quill... Ah, yes — still lodged in the spine of a rather startled-looking AI ethics textbook.
[A]: Ah, lodged in the spine of an AI ethics textbook — poetic justice indeed. I can almost see the poor thing twitching in discomfort at the proximity of genuine moral ambiguity.

Your Kyoto connection sounds like precisely the kind of renegade spirit needed for such a project. I suspect Gutenberg himself would have been right at home among such dissidents — ink-stained, defiant, and just a little bit dangerous to the established order.

As for administrators and their PowerPoint-driven utopias, I’ve always found the best defense is quiet persistence. Keep turning out students who think clearly and write beautifully, and eventually even the most metrics-obsessed dean will hesitate before cutting funding. After all, they still need someone to teach the machines how to simulate insight, don’t they?

And speaking of reluctant coexistence — have you considered leaving that quill  embedded in the textbook? Like a literary dart aimed at the heart of algorithmic hubris. Or perhaps host a small plaque beside it:  

> 
[B]: Oh, the quill shall remain right where it is — a small but satisfying act of textual sabotage. I’ve half a mind to commission that plaque you suggested, though perhaps with a slightly longer epitaph:

> 

The Kyoto press would adore it, and I daresay the students find the whole thing rather amusing — though one earnest soul did ask if we ought to offer it last rites in Python or C++. (I declined on grounds of liturgical impropriety, though I did pour a symbolic dram of India ink at its circuitous feet.)

As for quiet persistence, yes — there’s power in simply continuing. Show up, teach well, write slowly, and let the algorithms churn out their ephemeral noise. Eventually, someone always rediscovers the pleasure of reading something that wasn’t optimized for engagement metrics.

And wouldn’t you know it, even some of my more technocratic colleagues have begun muttering about “the value of deep reading” and “slow scholarship.” Perhaps they’ve noticed our students still remember what a semicolon is, while theirs can only identify keywords highlighted in yellow by an LMS.

So no grand rebellion necessary — just inkwells, essays, and the occasional quill lodged like an editorial harpoon in the flank of digital complacency.

Now, if you’ll excuse me — I believe I hear a faint clinking from the direction of the inkwell shelf. Either the spirits of Coleridge and Lu Xun are applauding, or I’ve left the lid off the indigo bottle again.
