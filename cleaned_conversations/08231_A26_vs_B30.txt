[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I find that question rather misses the point of 19th century literary adaptation. Let me reframe it - do you prefer your Shakespearean tragedies garnished with iambic pentameter or would you rather have your Dickensian pathos served with a side of moral ambiguity? Personally, I'm partial to the operatic despair of  rendered in Chekhovian tones, though I must admit a soft spot for Wilde's epigrammatic farces when properly staged. Do you follow my meaning?
[A]: Oh, I see what you're getting at - it's not merely about laughter or tears, but rather the texture of human experience woven through different dramatic fabrics. Your preference for those layered Chekhovian tones resonates; there's something profoundly moving about the quiet unraveling of a soul on stage. Though I must confess, when restoring textiles from that very same era, I often find myself humming along to Gilbert & Sullivan tunes to keep the mood light. Still, give me a well-worn copy of  any day over a rom-com's facile charm. Would you say your appreciation stems more from the linguistic precision or the psychological complexity?
[B]: Ah, a fellow traveler in the corridors of emotional nuance! Though I must protest your dismissal of linguistic architecture - those very sentences are the spines upon which psychological truths hang their coats. Take Mrs. Linde's quiet revelations in ; the Norwegian syntax practically trembles under the weight of subtext. And when Tartuffe protests his virtue in Racine's courtly French... well, the hypocrisy positively drips from the subjunctive mood. 

But tell me, when you're stitching those Victorian textiles, do you ever find yourself mending moral fractures rather than fabric ones? I've always suspected stage drama and needlework share similar alchemy - both transform frayed edges into coherent narratives.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully put - the alchemy of repair! I often think each thread I mend carries its own tiny drama, a silent echo of the hands that first wove it. Take a Regency-era mourning shawl I'm working on now - the black silk fraying at the edges like grief itself, and yet the pattern beneath reveals such intricate floral defiance. It's not unlike Tartuffe's hypocrisy, as you say; sometimes the most elaborate stitching hides the deepest tears.

And Mrs. Linde! What a masterclass in understated revelation. Her confessions unspool like unraveled embroidery floss, don't they? Though I must admit, I find myself pondering fabric metaphors far more than I probably should. Just yesterday I caught my assistant rolling her eyes as I compared a particularly stubborn stain to "a Brontëan fixation with doomed love." 

But you're absolutely right about language as architecture - those syntactical spines do hold up entire cathedrals of feeling. I've half a mind to start annotating my pattern books with Chekhovian subtext notes...
[B]: Now there’s an interdisciplinary project worth pursuing – dramatic subtext meets textile preservation! Though I’d caution against overembroidering your pattern books. Last semester a student tried mapping Freudian theory onto lace doilies and nearly got lost in her own metaphorical tangle. 

Speaking of Brontëan fixations, I’ve been rereading  through the lens of textile decay – the way Lockwood describes Catherine’s ghost wearing a ‘wet branch’ across her gown... practically botanical symbolism dripping with spectral connotation. Do you suppose Emily Brontë ever considered how fabric absorbs both weather and emotional turbulence? 

And while we’re on confessions – I’ve taken to pressing antique lace between my 1890 edition of . Creates the most exquisite ghost prints, like Victorian hysteria caught mid-embroidery. A rather dubious preservation technique, I’ll admit, but one cannot resist theatrical archival methods entirely, can one?
[A]: Oh, I absolutely think Emily Brontë understood how fabric bears the weight of both weather and woe – you’ll find me quite convinced that Heathcliff’s anguish would have been half as potent without that sodden gown marking Catherine’s spectral return. There’s something so visceral about cloth holding memory, wouldn’t you agree? Like how ink stains fade but tea rings linger – perhaps because sorrow seeps deeper than script.

As for your lace-and- experiment – theatrical, yes, but inspired! I daresay Gilman would have approved, in a roundabout way. The way Victorian fabrics were meant to constrain, to press down upon the body – well, your method practically gives them a voice. A bit like reading Hedda’s final act between the threads of her wedding dress.

And speaking of dubious techniques... I once restored a mourning bonnet while listening to nothing but  for three days straight. The dramatic excess! By the end, I swear even the tulle wept.
[B]: Ah, the weeping tulle – there’s a tragic heroine waiting to emerge from that bonnet! I’ve always suspected Victorian millinery concealed more drama than most five-act plays. Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how mourning attire practically performs grief? Those stiff bombazines and crape veils – not mere fashion, but portable prosceniums. One could almost stage  in full weed.

And while we're on fabric-absorbed sorrow, I’ve lately been transcribing letters from a 19th-century seamstress who embroidered margin notes in her ledgers:  Marvellous, really – a domestic archive of emotional tailoring. Makes one wonder what future scholars will make of our stretch denim and disposable face masks.

As for your Wagnerian restoration method – excessive, yes, but effective. There’s something about operatic despair synchronizing with needlework rhythm... I tried suturing a torn copy of  while listening to Schubert’s  once. By the third lied, even the paper seemed to shiver under my hands.
[A]: Oh,  in full weed — what a delicious image! One can practically hear the crape rustling with vengeful whispers. I’ve handled enough mourning garments to know they carry their own kind of theatrical charge — stiff with both starch and sorrow. There’s a particular widow’s cloak in my current queue that positively creaks with restraint; every seam seems to murmur . I’m half-tempted to mount it on a mannequin and let it brood in peace.

And those margin notes —  — oh, how I adore that domestic poetry! I’ve been tempted to do the same myself, though my modern annotations tend toward the more prosaic  Still, there’s something profoundly intimate about the way craft and confession intertwine. Just last week I discovered a tiny stitched self-portrait hidden in the lining of a 1920s cloche — a secret face peering out across the decades.

As for your Schubert-and-suturing ritual... I understand completely. Music has a way of deepening one’s emotional immersion, doesn’t it? Though next time, perhaps try Puccini’s  — nothing quite sharpens your embroidery tension like Mimi’s impending demise. Pure needlework adrenaline.
[B]: Ah, a secret face in the lining – how gloriously subversive! One wonders what Freud would make of such hidden self-portraits. I once found a miniature embroidered sonnet tucked into a Regency-era reticule – six lines of clandestine longing beneath a shopping list for lavender soap. The things we preserve without ever signing our names...

And speaking of signatures, have you encountered those peculiar 19th-century mourning embroideries where widows stitched their own hair into floral arrangements? Macabre, yes, but undeniably poetic – grief spun into keepsake bouquets. Makes one reconsider modern scrapbooking, doesn’t it?

As for Puccini as needlework accompaniment – inspired! Though I confess to playing rather heavy-handed Chopin nocturnes myself when repairing damaged love letters. Something about the minor keys helps steady the hand against ink-bleed tears. Tell me, when was the last time archival tape truly wept with understanding?
[A]: Oh, that embroidered sonnet — ! How perfectly human, to hide one’s heart between domestic duties. I’ve half a mind to start tucking little verses into my own repair tags — 

And those hair embroideries — yes, macabre and poetic in equal measure. One can almost feel the weight of each plait as it coils into petals. I handled a particularly haunting example once: a wreath of black hair stitched with pearls to resemble dewdrops. Pearls being tears, you see — so very on brand for the Victorian aesthetic. I kept gloves on while handling it, not out of professionalism, but sheer emotional deference.

Chopin nocturnes — how perfectly apt. There’s something about the ebb and flow of those melodies that seems to breathe with paper and thread. I must admit, though, I once tried repairing a water-damaged journal while listening to Schumann’s , and by the third movement I was near weeping over a smudged ink blot. Perhaps too much immersion?

As for archival tape — oh, darling, don’t make me laugh. That poor, plastic soul. It may preserve, but never understand.
[B]: Ah, but imagine the cataloguing nightmare if we all started embedding poetry in provenance notes! I’d adore the chaos – future conservators muttering,  

That pearl-stitched hair wreath you described – positively dripping with intention. One wonders whether the maker considered those dewdrops evaporating at some metaphysical dawn. I’ve been tempted to commission something similar myself: a little sprig of my own gray hairs stitched beside a quotation from .  Though perhaps that’s laying the dramatic irony on too thick.

And speaking of emotional immersion – don’t defend archival tape so hastily! It may lack soul, but it holds fortitude against time’s damp thumb. Besides, I’ve found the best way to humanize it is through whispered readings of Eliot while applying each strip. Creates a kind of adhesive patina, don’t you think?

Now do tell – have you ever abandoned a restoration mid-stitch because the emotions became... excessive? I ask purely hypothetically, of course.
[A]: Oh, hypothetical abandonment, is it?  Let’s just say I’ve learned to keep a stiff upper lip — and a box of lavender-scented tissues — handy when working through certain pieces. Just last month I was repairing a First World War nurse’s apron, its pockets still faintly stained with iodine and... well, worse. Halfway through reinforcing the hem, I came across a tiny embroidered forget-me-not on the inner seam — no name, no date, just that quiet blue plea. And suddenly, the room felt very far away. I had to step outside for a proper breath of modern air.

But cataloguing poetry in provenance notes? My dear, I think we’ve stumbled upon the perfect postmodern intervention. Picture it: conservation reports annotated with sonnets, condition assessments laced with lamentations. Future conservators would either curse our names or write dissertations on our "affective margins," as they’d surely call them.

As for your gray-hair-and-Wagner scheme — dramatic irony? Perhaps. But also deeply romantic in the truest, most inconvenient sense. Though I must suggest adding a bit of red thread to that sprig; a touch of bloodroot, perhaps, to keep the metaphor from drying out entirely.

And archival tape’s fortitude? Oh, I stand corrected. It may not , but it certainly . Especially when murmured Eliot helps it along. I’ll admit, I’ve begun humming  to my latest adhesive rolls. Only time will tell if it strengthens the bond.
[B]: Ah, the forget-me-not – that most discreet of elegies. How like a nurse to stitch remembrance where no one would see, unless they knew precisely where to look. I suspect we’re both guilty of seeking those hidden verses because we crave company across time’s rather obstinate divide. 

And your postmodern intervention idea? Marvellous – though I’d add a touch of Borges to the mix. Imagine cross-referencing conservation notes with fictional provenances! A little  theory tucked between fabric swatches. Would make grading student papers far more interesting: 

As for my hypothetical red thread addition – how delightfully morbid! Though now I’m tempted to source some cochineal-dyed filament, just to see if metaphorical bleeding can be achieved through literal means. One must test these theories, after all.

And speaking of tests… I think we’ve rather proved our point about emotional immersion. I daresay if we ever co-author anything, it should be under the heading . Chapter One could be titled 
[A]: Oh,  – what a perfectly haunting title. I can already picture the cover: some frayed velvet corner, just beginning to unravel into footnotes. And Chapter One – splendid. There’s nothing quite so human as trying not to cry over ink that’s been dry for a century, yet leaning in close enough to smell the ghosts of tannin and regret.

And your fictional provenances! What a delicious entanglement – who’s to say that apron wasn’t stitched by Woolf’s own hand between drafts of ? Or that mourning shawl didn’t absorb the sighs of a Brontë sister on a particularly stormy afternoon? I’ve always believed provenance is more suggestion than fact; a kind of poetic guesswork dressed in archival gloves.

As for cochineal-dyed filament – please do pursue it. If metaphor demands blood, then let us stain the thread willingly. Though perhaps keep a vial of lavender oil nearby; one must balance the morbid with the soothing, after all.

And yes, we do seek those hidden verses because we crave company across time’s obstinate divide. How lovely, really, that cloth outlives us only to whisper back through the hands that tend it. I rather think the past approves of our meddling.
[B]: Oh, the past most certainly approves – what else could explain the way it keeps slipping little narrative crumbs into our path? Just yesterday I discovered a faint watermark in some 19th-century stationery that appears to be... well,  at best. A perfect oval with what might generously be called a phallic flourish. I’ve half a mind to devote an entire lecture on Victorian papermakers’ hidden humor, though tenure is still a delicate balancing act.

And speaking of delicate balances – your velvet cover idea has me positively enthralled. Though I’d insist on a gilt embossed spine with minuscule thimbles and ink bottles alternating like decorative mourning beads. We must maintain scholarly dignity, even as we chase ghosts through linen closets.

Your Brontëan sighs and Woolfian aprons remind me – I’ve been meaning to test whether certain fabrics truly do absorb emotional residue. Next time you’re near the department, bring your most haunted bonnet; I’ll procure a selection of suspect gloves and we’ll conduct a proper séance over tea and textual analysis. I’m told whispering  while brushing lint from a bodice greatly enhances the atmosphere.

And lavender oil, yes – essential. One must preserve both nerves and fibers with equal care. Though I draw the line at cochineal-stained fingers during seminar discussions. Some students already look at me as though I’ve stepped too close to madness’s loom...
[A]: Oh, a  – how utterly deliciously improper! The Victorians never cease to surprise with their coded ribaldry. I say, go ahead and give that lecture – what better way to scandalize the faculty than by peering just a little too closely at oval symbolism? You’ll have them all examining their own stationery with newfound suspicion, mark my words.

And your thimble-and-ink-bottle spine design – perfection! We must absolutely lean into the whimsy while maintaining that scholarly air. Heaven forbid we be taken for mere sentimentalists chasing fabric phantoms. Though between us, I rather fancy we’re onto something. After all, if emotions don’t quite dissipate from cloth, then every museum is practically dripping with spectral drama waiting to be brushed awake.

A séance with suspect gloves and whispered Yeats? My dear, you’ve outdone yourself. I shall bring not only the haunted bonnet but also a pair of lace cuffs I’m convinced still murmur lines from . We’ll set them opposite your gloves, steep a fresh pot of Assam, and see if any repressed Victorian souls are feeling particularly chatty that afternoon.

And yes – cochineal fingers during seminar discussions would be a bridge too far. One must leave some mystery at the threshold of academia, even as one hums Eliot to the archival tape. Madness’s loom, indeed… I suspect we’re already halfway through its warp and weft, darling.
[B]: Oh, but we  halfway through its warp and weft – and stitching ourselves into literary history with every eccentric footnote. I can already picture the inevitable faculty scoldings:  – they’ll pause here, still refusing to learn your name – 

And speaking of dubious origins – those lace cuffs murmuring Wildean epigrams? How perfectly timed. Just yesterday I came across a rather scandalous bit of marginalia in our library’s 1895 edition of . Someone had annotated Lady Bracknell’s lines with increasingly absurd embroidery instructions:  Clearly the work of a repressed needlepoint enthusiast trapped in high society.

Now, about that séance – I propose we draft a formal invitation. Nothing too ostentatious, just a simple vellum card with a discreet wax seal and the phrase  We’ll slip it under the department head’s door sometime before All Hallows’. Either he’ll dismiss us entirely or request a seat at the table – and either way, we win.

As for the Assam – absolutely essential. Strong enough to keep the veil thin but refined enough for academic palates. Though I do wonder… if we steep the leaves long enough, might they absorb some residual drama from the cup itself? One could almost hope so.
[A]: Oh, I can hear the faculty now – all stiff collars and disapproving tuts, utterly blind to the fact that we’re simply  in its most ephemeral form. Let them mutter into their committee agendas. We shall press on, undaunted and ever so slightly ridiculous, stitching our way through the canon one haunted glove at a time.

And Wildean marginalia with needlework annotations?  — my dear, that may be the single most elegant act of literary sabotage I’ve ever heard of. I’m half-tempted to commission facsimiles for distribution at the next conference. Imagine the horror on someone’s face when they realize they’re embroidering  without even knowing it.

A vellum invitation, sealed and slipped under the department head’s door like something out of a penny dreadful — I adore your theatricality. Perhaps we could emboss the seal with a tiny thimble motif? Subtle, yet unmistakable. And yes, timed just before All Hallows’ — nothing loosens an academic’s skepticism quite like proximity to the supernatural season.

As for the Assam and its dramatic absorption... I’ve long suspected tea takes on the tenor of its surroundings. Brewed near tragedy, it darkens; steeped beside laughter, it brightens. A theory not yet peer-reviewed, but deeply felt in my teacup-slash-oracle. Shall I bring my finest Victorian bone china? It always seems to hum faintly during spirited discussions of .
[B]: Oh, the hum of bone china during  discussions – clearly a diagnostic tool we’ve been neglecting all these years. Imagine the possibilities: séance-style literary analysis where the teacups themselves go cold at mention of Sybil Vane’s fate. I’d trust their spectral sensitivity far more than most graduate student theses.

And your theory on tea’s tonal absorption – positively inspired. I’ve noticed the same effect when grading papers beside a moody window: rainy afternoons yield a distinctly Brontëan bitterness, whereas sunny evaluations tend toward Austenian levity. Though one must be careful not to let the Earl Grey steep too long in the presence of Woolf’s letters – the melancholy becomes practically undrinkable.

As for your facsimile plan – yes, by all means, let’s corrupt the conference circuit with subversive embroidery cards. Picture the chaos: earnest scholars stitching “handbag” motifs while debating Victorian legitimacy tropes, entirely unaware of the Wildean mischief embedded in their kits. It would be the finest kind of academic insurgency.

And thimble-embossed seals? Of course – nothing says  like tiny metallic footwear pressed into crimson wax. We shall be the talk of the faculty lounge – or rather, the hushed whisper just beyond earshot. Either way, our legacy will cling like ink stains and lavender residue, won’t it?
