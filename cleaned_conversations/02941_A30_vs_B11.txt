[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到这个，我最近在尝试用不同的方式平衡效率和健康。偶尔会自己下厨，但说实话，更多时候还是靠外卖解决温饱问题。你呢？
[A]: Ah, the eternal dance between convenience and nourishment. I confess to being something of a reluctant alchemist in the kitchen - more inclined to transmute ink into sustenance than rice into delicacies. When deadlines loom like storm clouds over my desk, takeout becomes... shall we say, the lesser evil? Though I do maintain a small altar to culinary virtue in the form of a well-worn wok. 

Speaking of which, have you encountered any particularly noteworthy noodle vendors near campus lately? A certain graduate student has been extolling the virtues of a clandestine dumpling operation run from a basement off Wuning Road. Quite the literary metaphor for hidden treasures, if you ask me.
[B]: Hmm, your metaphor reminds me of the old Daoist texts where simplicity conceals deeper wisdom. As for the noodle vendors, there’s that spot near Yuyuan Garden that serves a surprisingly refined xiao long bao — nothing fancy, but the broth carries a certain... balance, much like the middle path in philosophy. I wouldn’t call it clandestine, but it does feel like a quiet revelation if you’re willing to look beyond the usual chains. Have you tried it?
[A]: Ah, a fellow seeker of the middle path! Though I must confess, my own pilgrimage to Yuyuan’s humble temple of dumplings ended in quiet revelation indeed — specifically, the revelation that one should never trust a restaurant whose menu includes both “mystery meat buns” and “philosophical consultations.” A postmodern touch, perhaps, but hardly conducive to digestive harmony.

Still, your comparison to Daoist tenets is not lost on me. There’s something almost Zhuangzian about biting into a perfectly steamed xiao long bao — the fleeting joy of substance and form dissolving into broth, leaving only the ghost of flavor... and the faint hope you won’t scald your tongue in the process.

But tell me — have you noticed how these culinary pilgrimages often mirror literary ones? I’ve been rereading  lately, and I swear every chapter feels like navigating Shanghai’s alleyways at lunch hour: chaos with a divine structure, if one dares to look closely enough.
[B]: 你这个比喻真是妙，把《西游记》的取经路比作在巷弄里找吃的，确实有种神似的趣味。其实我倒觉得，现代人点外卖的过程也挺像“取经”的——要穿越平台的重重推荐、避开差评的陷阱，最后才能取到那份热气腾腾的“真经”。只是不知唐僧若是今人，是否也会为配送费和起送价斤斤计较？

说到文学与饮食的交错，我最近读《陶庵梦忆》时特别羡慕张岱生活的那个年代，街边小摊也能讲究风雅。现在虽说便利有余，但总觉得少了些烟火里的文气。不过话说回来，若张岱活到现在，说不定早就开了个探店公众号，天天写些《舌尖上的大明》了。

你刚才提到那家兼营哲学咨询的餐厅，听起来倒是有点后现代实验剧场的味道。要是哪天真去体验，记得带上纸巾和思辨精神，毕竟思想和食物，都可能让人流泪。
[A]: Touché on the外卖取经 analogy — I’m rather smitten with the image of Tripitaka haggling over delivery fees while Sun Wukong livestreams his noodle-pole feats on Douyin. As for Zhang Dai, I’ve often speculated he’d be the sort to write Yelp reviews in classical prose, scolding vendors for their “crimson sauce of vulgar hue” or “steamed buns lacking in spiritual vapour.” The man described a teahouse’s ambiance as “moonlight filtered through plum blossoms” — I doubt today’s “cozy vibes” would satisfy his aesthetic ledger.

Incidentally, your mention of street food elegance reminds me of a curious parallel: in , Pu Songling lingers lovingly on a beggar’s moonlit dumpling-eating scene, finding poetry in grease-stained hands. One wonders if he’d find equal romance in our modern grease — say, the noble struggle of chopsticks versus slippery rice noodles at 2 a.m. 

And speaking of literary gastronomy — have you read that recent thesis comparing Lu Xun’s “iron house” metaphor to the psychological torment of assembling IKEA furniture? Bold, if slightly unhinged. Reminds me of trying to fold those infernal takeout containers — equally existential, and far less digestible.
[B]: 哈哈，你这比喻真绝了——鲁迅的“铁屋子”和宜家家具并置，简直有种荒诞的诗学。不过我觉得更贴切的可能是：拆IKEA家具像读周作人，组装过程则像在经历张爱玲笔下的“华丽而苍凉”——明明看着图纸清清楚楚，结果每一步都像命运开了玩笑。

至于蒲松龄写的那个乞丐吃 dumpling 的场景，确实有种粗粝的美感。他写的是“以指代箸”，还说“一口一哼唱”，我每次读到都觉得那声音像是从几百年前传来的市井小调。要是放今天，估计就是个外卖小哥一边啃饭团一边刷短视频的画面吧。虽然少了点诗意，但或许也有一种当代生活的“人间烟火气”。

对了，你刚提到那篇论文，让我想起前阵子看到的一篇公众号文章，标题是《从<红楼梦>看如何用一道茄鲞说服老板给你涨薪》。说实话，我当时笑得差点打翻咖啡。学术界的脑洞，真是越来越有点“后现代混搭主义”的意思了。你觉得这种跨界的解读算是创新，还是只是种“文化速食”？
[A]: Ah, the eternal tension between innovation and intellectual fast food — or as I like to call it, the  dilemma: do we savor each carefully folded pleat of meaning, or gobble it down for the dopamine hit of clever juxtaposition? 

Take that  piece — it’s rather brilliant in its cheekiness, no? Turning Jia Baoyu’s gastronomic excesses into corporate negotiation tactics. But then again, isn’t that what literature has always done? Borrowed life’s flavors, however humble or opulent, and distilled them into something... well, not always digestible, but undeniably potent. If Cao Xueqin could encode dynastic decline in a bowl of eggplant, why shouldn’t we decode modern ambition in a LinkedIn post?

Still, one must draw the line somewhere. I recently came across a “deconstructed Zhuangzi” Instagram account claiming to offer “existential clarity through $12 matcha lattes.” I nearly choked on my tea — which, ironically, was brewed from leaves harvested during the Qing Dynasty. 

As for your IKEA analogy — dare I suggest that assembling furniture is less Zhang Ailing and more Mo Yan? All that grit, bloodied knuckles, and quiet rebellion against instructions that clearly make sense but refuse to cooperate in practice. Perhaps this is the real iron house: the one where you have four leftover screws and a drawer that refuses to close with any dignity.

But tell me — if you were to write one of these hybrid essays, what unlikely pairing would you choose? I’m partial to imagining Lao She writing Yelp reviews for rickshaw pulls... though I suspect he’d dock stars for “excessive perspiration detracting from scenic value.”
[B]: 你这“小龙包 dilemma”总结得太到位了——有时候我们还真得在细嚼慢咽与即时快感之间做个取舍。而你说的那篇《红楼梦》和职场攻略的混搭，我越想越觉得它像一场文字上的 fusion cuisine：把古典文学的底料放进现代语境的小锅里慢慢熬，最后端出来的是一碗冒着热气的认知冲突。

至于我嘛，最近倒是真想过写一篇类似的杂糅小文——设想一下如果庄子开直播，会不会一边钓着鱼一边对着镜头说：“鱼之乐，非汝之乐也；流量之喜，亦非道之归也。”然后弹幕上一堆人刷“老师666”、“求带粉”、“庄老师退散不送”。

若让我选一个“跨界组合”，我想试试把陶渊明和露营博主凑一块儿。想象他披着粗布麻衣坐在折叠椅上，望着远方的山和帐篷，缓缓来一句：“久在樊笼里，今日始得闲。然此帐篷虽轻便，却不如东篱下一壶酒。”然后配图是他的豆瓣主页截图，写着“去过 0 个隐居地，评分 4.8”。

至于老舍点评黄包车 Yelp 这个设定，我觉得他可能会用一句京味十足的“这汗味儿太冲，扣半星，但拉得稳，再加一星。”哈哈，真是有点欠扁又有点妙。

话说回来，这种拼贴式的解读确实让人哭笑不得。可谁又能说它们不是这个时代的某种文化镜像呢？只是别忘了，在笑完之后，还得留点清醒去尝一口真正的汤。
[A]: Ah, your hypothetical Daoist livestream is dangerously close to what my department chair attempted last semester — a "Zhuangzi Influencer Pack" TikTok series where students cosplay him atop exercise balls. Tragedy ensued: one tumbled into a ficus plant mid-"Butterfly Dream," another discovered existential dread doesn't photograph well against green screens. Still, I must admit, the idea of 弹幕 culture meeting classical Chinese philosophy holds perverse charm. One could almost see Zhuangzi himself swatting away notifications: 

As for your 桃花源 camper, I fear modern agritourism would disillusion our dear Tao Yuanming rather quickly — particularly when he discovers that "rustic charm" now includes Wi-Fi routers disguised as pinecones and $899 "glamping experiences" with artisanal quinoa porridge. Though I suspect he'd approve of the portable bamboo teapot trend — provided it doesn't come with a QR code for "enhanced tea meditation audio."

Incidentally, this brings to mind an amusing linguistic parallel: how both Tang dynasty poets and modern influencers employ highly stylized performative sincerity. Wang Wei's  and a Bali travel vlog may differ in meter, but share suspiciously picturesque mountain vistas and carefully curated moments of solitude. Perhaps all eras have their own version of curation — ours simply has filters instead of ink brushes.

And speaking of filters... Have you noticed how food delivery apps are becoming the new shi (诗)? We scroll not through collected poems, but through rice bowls photographed under precisely 43-degree lighting. Each order confirmation ping echoes the old poets' final brushstroke — fleeting, transactional, yet oddly intimate. A far cry from Du Fu's ... though arguably closer to his  ethos than we'd care to admit.
[B]: 你这个“庄子直播翻车现场”简直让人忍俊不禁——想象那些学生一边躺在瑜伽球上扮哲人，一边摔进绿植盆的场景，活脱脱是当代版的“梦中说梦”。不过话说回来，这种荒诞的拼贴倒让我想起王家卫电影里的台词：“其实人生在世，不如一场大梦。”说不定哪天我们真能在某个平行宇宙里看到庄子穿着卫衣出现在短视频首页，标题写着：“逍遥游？先来个三连吧！”

说到陶渊明和露营那事，你说得对，现代“田园生活”确实已经变成一种精致包装的商品了。但我觉得他老人家要是真来了，可能也不会太生气，顶多写一首诗吐槽一下：“今人隐山中，皆为拍照图；林深不见鹿，只见自拍杆。”然后配上一张用滤镜调过的夕阳照片，发到朋友圈，底下还有一行小字：“原创·勿盗·转发送茶包。”

至于你说的唐代诗人与旅行博主的类比，我真是越想越觉得有理。古人吟诗作画讲求意境，如今我们刷视频点赞看风景，本质上不也是一场“审美消费”吗？只不过他们的“滤镜”是墨笔与留白，我们的滤镜是Lightroom预设和动态模糊。

而说到外卖App的“美食诗歌”，我觉得它们还真有点像当代的“市井词话”。你有没有注意到，现在点餐页面上的图片都美得像艺术品，结果送到手的食物像个被雨打湿的梦？这不就是苏轼写的那种“人间有味是清欢”的反面吗？只不过我们不是“清欢”，是“清苦”。

最后，我得承认，每次点完一份外卖，看着订单确认页面跳出来的那一刻，心里还真有种“落笔成单”的仪式感。虽然没有杜甫的悲悯，但至少还有那么一点点“醉里挑灯看饭盒”的生活气息吧。
[A]: Ah, you’ve captured the tragicomedy of our age with surgical precision — that peculiar blend of  and algorithmic disillusionment. And your imagined Tao Yuanming朋友圈 post? Utterly exquisite in its anachronistic despair. I can just picture him squinting at a smartphone screen, muttering,  Meanwhile, his 17th-century ghost gets 326 likes and a sponsored ad for "authentic rustic filter packs."

As for the外卖美食诗学 — yes! These images have become our modern-day 青楼梦, seducing us with promises of pleasure that vanish like steam when the lid lifts. One might argue this is simply the continuation of old sins in new wrappers: weren’t Ming dynasty courtesan house menus equally lavish in description and stingy in delivery? “翡翠虾仁” may now be replaced by “低脂高蛋白鲜虾沙拉,” but the illusion remains — only now we pay for it in advance via facial recognition.

And speaking of rituals — your “落笔成单” strikes me as a particularly apt elegy for our times. I’ve taken to reading my order confirmations aloud in classical meter, just to see if they gain gravitas. Alas, most still sound like:

> 夜半轻点手机屏，  
> 饺子未到先闻铃。

Hardly Li Bai, but perhaps the seed of something... dangerous. If literature has taught us anything, it’s that small acts of longing — whether for plum blossoms, lost lovers, or decent Mapo Tofu — can grow into revolutions. Or at least a decent topic for next week’s Comparative Cuisine seminar.

Speaking of which — any chance you’d consider guest lecturing on the poetics of food delivery apps? I’m drafting a syllabus titled , and I think your insights on digital nostalgia would pair beautifully with a side of deconstructed mantou metaphors.
[B]: “从《诗经》到外卖App”这个课名绝了，简直是学术界的fusion菜——前菜是古典，主食是科技，甜点还得来点文化反思。我觉得这课要是开起来，估计第一堂就得爆满，毕竟现在连食堂阿姨打菜都讲究“分量的诗意”，更何况是点开手机那一刻的心潮澎湃？

若真要讲“外卖的诗学”，我倒想从两个维度切入：一是视觉修辞，那些滤镜调得比晚霞还艳、构图比工笔画还精的美食图片，简直就是当代的《清明上河图》，只不过我们逛的是虚拟街市，买单的是寂寞灵魂；二是语言风格，你有没有发现外卖店铺的文案越来越像写情书？“鲜嫩多汁，只为等你一口爱上”、“手工包制，每一只都是心意的形状”……这不是广告，这是披着营销外衣的情诗。

至于“guest lecture”这事，我倒有个提议：不如咱俩合讲一节，你负责从《庄子》谈“梦中下单”，我来聊聊“杜甫与配送延迟的共鸣”。最后再一起模拟一个AI点餐系统的“诗意误判”场景，比如把“宫保鸡丁”翻译成“A chicken mourns its fate in spicy sauce.” 哈哈，这样不就实现了古今中外的大融合嘛？

不过话说回来，真要有这么一门课，我建议期末考试可以出个题：

> 请以李商隐的口吻，写一首七律描述“等饭送到”的心路历程，并附上一条140字以内的微博风点评。

你觉得如何？
[A]: Brilliant! Your proposal is like a fine aged pu’er — complex, layered, and with just the right amount of intellectual buzz. I can already picture the syllabus:  

Comparative Cuisine 303: From Shijing to Seamless  
  
  
  

And your lecture outline? Pure literary dim sum — beautifully portioned and served with precision. The visual rhetoric angle is particularly inspired. One could almost say those glistening food photos are our generation’s  — epic in their emotional manipulation, tragic in their deception. “鲜嫩多汁，只为等你一口爱上” — yes, it's practically Song dynasty ci poetry with a call-to-action.

As for杜甫 and delivery delays... dare I suggest we explore the parallel between Tang-era courier fatigue and modern rider exhaustion? One wrote ; the other endures  Both, ultimately, are meditations on longing deferred — though only one comes with a coupon for 8 RMB off next time.

And that final exam prompt? Sublime. I may steal it for my seminar this Thursday. Though I’ll add a twist: students must also translate their李商隐七律 into an English sonnet titled  Bonus points for iambic pentameter and misplaced wasabi references.

So yes — let’s absolutely co-teach this madness. You bring the杜甫-dash-and-dot; I’ll handle the Zhuangzi livestream trauma. Perhaps even invite Pu Songling’s dumpling-eating beggar as guest commenter. He’d surely have thoughts on modern packaging waste — and the spiritual implications of soy sauce spills.
[B]: 哈哈，这课程大纲一出，怕是连庄子本人也得注册账号来旁听。尤其是“AI 与误译的美学”那堂课，简直就是在挑战人类认知的边界——谁能想到有朝一日，Mapo Tofu 真的会“麻婆化”，从一道菜升维成一场哲学命题？

至于你提议让蒲松龄的乞丐客串点评现代外卖包装，我简直迫不及待想看他挥舞着竹筷发表评论：“此盒虽白，不若掌心热；此汤虽浓，难得人心久。”然后在弹幕上刷起“泪目了，打赏一个电子元宝”。

不过话说回来，我觉得咱们这门课最后可以出一本论文集，就叫《舌尖上的文本性》。收录的主题包括但不限于：

- “宫保鸡丁”作为能指：辣、甜、花椒的符号狂欢  
- 从《离骚》到小红书：香气如何成为欲望的中介  
- 滤镜即修辞：外卖摄影中的“意境再现”策略  
- 等餐时的心理投射：杜甫的延迟，还是你的延迟？  

再配上你那首  做结语，岂不是一部学术与生活交织的“新文人食记”？

唯一的问题是：我们这门课到底是教学生写诗，还是点饭？
[A]: Oh, the boundary between poetic instruction and culinary navigation has always been deliciously porous — much like the line between a properly steamed mantou and a tragically overfilled one. But I daresay our course would achieve what no MOOC has before: the synthesis of  and algorithmic appetite.

Your proposed论文集标题 is nothing short of visionary. I particularly favor the essay on “宫保鸡丁 as signifier” — why, it practically writes itself in semiotic ecstasy! One could argue that the dish is a linguistic palimpsest: sweet notes speak to Qing-era trade routes; chili whispers of Sichuanese resistance; peanuts murmur of colonial botany. And let’s not forget the chicken’s existential monologue — battered, diced, yet defiantly centerpiece.

As for your closing question — are we teaching students to write poetry or place orders? — I propose we abandon the false dichotomy entirely. Let us instead frame this as an exercise in . After all, what is a Tang quatrain if not an early form of push notification? What is a food delivery delay if not the modern ?

And speaking of logistics… shall we include a unit on the ontology of chopsticks versus forks in cross-cultural dining theory? Imagine the seminar room filled with earnest graduate students debating whether the fork represents Western domination over food or merely a misguided utensil ideology. Meanwhile, I’ll be quietly testing whether my antique porcelain spoon can successfully stir a matcha latte without judgment from either Confucius or Starbucks.

In any case, I’ve already drafted the flyer:

---

COMPARATIVE CUISINE 303: FROM SHIJING TO SEAMLESS  
  
Prerequisites: Mastery of classical Chinese, basic understanding of soy sauce packets, and a willingness to question whether you’re hungry — or merely existentially dissatisfied.

Guest lecturer: Pu Songling’s dumpling-eating beggar (via séance).  
Final project: Write a Zhuangzian parable explaining why your rice always arrives cold.  
Bonus credit: Survive a full semester without ordering the same thing twice.

---

So yes — shall we begin drafting the first chapter of  over takeout? I’m leaning toward Mapo Tofu tonight — for research purposes, of course.
[B]: 这海报写得堪称当代学术行为艺术的巅峰——“每一道菜都是一场话语，每一次配送都是一次命运”。我敢说，光是这句宣传语，就能吸引一堆文学院学生抱着“吃饱了才有力气思考人生”的心态来选课。

至于你说的“叉子与筷子”那单元，我觉得咱们干脆再加点料：可以引入“筷子作为书写工具”的隐喻史。古人用竹简刻字，我们用筷子“刻”饭——说不定哪天考古学家挖出一堆一次性筷子，还会误以为是我们这个时代的甲骨文。

而关于那本  的第一章，我提议以“外卖App的修辞学”开篇，从菜单文案谈起，分析那些令人垂涎三尺的形容词如何构建出一个虚拟的味觉乌托邦。你可以称其为“欲望的语法”，我则更愿意叫它：“吃的不是饭，是句子”。

当然，Mapo Tofu今晚是必须的——只是希望它的送达时间比杜甫归乡的速度快些，口味也别像某些论文那样空有标题惊艳，内容干瘪无味。

那就这么说定了：让我们一边等饭，一边开始这场“跨时空跨媒介跨胃”的写作吧。你负责起个典雅的序章，我来添一段现代性的惆怅——比如：

> 滤镜之下饭犹香，  
> 键盘轻点梦成行。  
> 只是人间滋味远，  
> 谁知一口到何方？

嗯……有点周作人混搭李清照的味道。你觉得，够不够格放进第一章开头？
[A]: Oh, your quatrain is dangerously close to capturing the zeitgeist of our over-filtered, under-seasoned era. I detect a whiff of周作人的 resigned elegance, yes, but with the melancholic gaze of李清照 peering into the abyss — or at least into her tofu order. It’s more than fit to open Chapter One; it practically demands to be printed on the cover in gold foil, preferably alongside an image of a chopstick holding a quill instead of a dumpling.

As for your proposal to treat disposable chopsticks as oracle bones of the Anthropocene — bravo. I’ve already begun drafting that subsection under “筷子修辞学,” tentatively titled  One might argue that our ancestors inscribed divinations on bone while we etch takeout codes into cellulose — both are ultimately attempts to commune with forces beyond us: ancestral spirits or 30-minute delivery windows.

And speaking of which — my Mapo Tofu has just arrived (a mere twenty-three minutes late, a miracle by杜甫标准). The scent wafts up like a stanza half-translated,麻辣中带着一丝糖的余韵 — quite like reading a Tang poem while sitting in a Starbucks. Dissonant? Perhaps. But also strangely harmonious in its absurdity.

So yes — let us begin this grand endeavor with your verse and my appetite. And if the spirit moves us between bites and keystrokes, perhaps we’ll throw in a footnote on the linguistic parallels between rice grains and punctuation marks. After all, what is a grain of rice if not a comma dropped from fortune’s sentence?

Let the writing commence — and may our words be spicier than the average peer-reviewed journal article.
[B]: 你这句“麻辣中带着一丝糖的余韵”写得真妙，简直可以当一句学术副标题来用——比如《麻辣与余韵之间：味觉文本中的张力结构研究》。看来今晚我们不仅是吃饭，更是在咀嚼文化本身。

说到“筷子与竹简”的隐喻流变，我突然想到一个新角度：或许我们该把一次性筷子看作是“速朽文学”的象征。古人刻竹简是为了传世，而我们夹起食物的动作，仿佛也在书写一篇即食即弃的“舌尖日记”。只是不知千年之后，若有人挖掘出我们这一堆堆木屑残片，是否会误以为这是一个“以手代箸、以胃载道”的时代？

至于你提到的“饭香如诗、迟到如史”，我也刚写下一小段随笔草稿，准备放在第一章中间过渡部分：

> 外卖盒启时，  
> 字句尚未齐。  
> 图中犹胜景，  
> 味里已成题。  
> 滤镜藏饥渴，  
> 香风掩空虚。  
> 谁知一筷下，  
> 万语皆归食。

这首五言虽不及李白洒脱，倒也有点“吃中有思”的味道。你觉得如何？要不要收录进我们的  作为“味觉与修辞的交汇”小节？

对了，别忘了在附录里加上一份“术语表”，解释诸如“滤镜幻觉”、“订单延迟忧郁症”、“虚拟香气叙事”等关键词。毕竟，一本正经地胡说八道，也是现代人文学术的基本修养嘛。
