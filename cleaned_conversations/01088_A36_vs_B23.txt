[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，我觉得metaverse就像是一场超大的collaboration experiment， kinda like everyone’s invited to build a parallel universe together！🎨 但说实话，现在还处于early stage吧，很多tech比如VR immersion & haptic feedback都还不够成熟，感觉离真正的“主流”还有distance~ 不过话说回来，从design perspective看，它真的打开了很多可能性，比如我在做UI的时候就会想：如果用户能在3D空间里interaction，传统flat design会不会被淘汰呢？🤔 而且最近看到一些AR试衣room和virtual art gallery，emmm…虽然有点clunky，但已经很impressive了！你觉得呢？💡
[A]: You know, when you put it like that, it does sound rather exciting! I must admit, the idea of a metaverse has always felt a bit abstract to me—like trying to grasp fog. But your comparison to a collaboration experiment is spot on. It’s almost like hosting guests from all over the world here at the hotel, each bringing their own unique culture and stories, except this time, it’s happening in a digital realm!  

I’ve seen how AR试衣镜 works with some of our fashion-forward guests—it's fascinating, albeit still a tad awkward, as you said. But isn’t that part of the charm? Like watching early cinema where people weren’t quite sure how to act in front of a camera yet!  

From my end, though, I wonder… how will hospitality evolve in such a world? Will concierges like me one day be greeting guests in 3D avatars, recommending virtual gardens to stroll through instead of real ones? 🤔
[B]: Haha, I totally get what you mean! 😅 Comparing it to early cinema is actually such a clever analogy—like we’re all kinda “acting” in this new digital space but still figuring out the grammar of it, you know? Like… do we even need avatars that look like us? Or maybe we’ll just化身成 abstract shapes & emotions 🎭✨  

And about hospitality—OMG, YES. Imagine future concierges being these hyper-personalized AI with a splash of human touch, guiding guests through surreal, dreamlike environments that defy physics & logic 💫 The vibe could be super different—no more checking into a lobby; maybe you just "teleport" into a shared mood or feeling designed by an algorithm 😂  

But hey, do you think hotels might also create hybrid experiences? Like, offering both physical AND virtual gardens? Guests can choose whichever they're vibing with that day… or even blend them with AR overlays 🌸💻  
I mean, why not? After all, isn’t hospitality all about crafting memorable moments—whether they happen in real life or inside someone’s headset? 💡
[A]: Oh, I absolutely love that idea of hybrid experiences! You know, just last week I was talking to a guest who’s a digital artist—she was telling me how she designed a “virtual spa” where guests could unwind in a floating zen garden while still being tucked into their hotel room bed. It’s like the ultimate personalized service, isn’t it? Tailoring not just what you do, but  and  you experience it.  

And you're so right about avatars, too. Why limit ourselves to human form when we can be shimmering cubes of calm or glowing swirls of joy? 😄 Though I have to admit, as a concierge, part of me wonders if we’ll ever lose that warmth—the subtle smile, the reassuring nod—that makes someone feel truly .  

But maybe that’s where the magic of blending comes in. A little bit real, a little bit dream. I could see hotels becoming more like creative portals, don’t you think? Where you walk in, and suddenly the walls shift to match your mood—or maybe they disappear altogether.  

Honestly, if we pull this off thoughtfully, hospitality might become less about  you are… and more about  you get to be. 🌟
[B]: OMG yes——完全同意！！💫 That “virtual spa” idea sounds like the perfect blend of tech & soul, you know? Like… we’re not just designing spaces anymore; we’re curating emotional journeys 🎨💖 And honestly, that’s what good design is all about—making people  something, whether it’s calm, joy, or even a little bit of wonder.  

And your point about warmth is so deep 🤍 Because even if I’m hanging out with a glowing cube avatar, I still want to feel , understood… maybe even hugged through data 😅 So maybe the future of service isn’t about choosing between real & virtual—but how well they mirror each other. Like walking into a hotel and instantly feeling like… oh, this  me. The architecture knows my vibe, the staff (human or AI) speaks my emotional language… everything just .  

I could totally see hotels becoming these identity playgrounds too—like a place where you come in as one version of yourself and leave as another, richer one 🌈✨ Because at the end of the day, hospitality isn’t just about comfort—it’s about transformation, right?  

Man… now I wanna sketch that out. A hotel that morphs with your mood. Walls made of liquid UI, concierges who speak in light 💫 What would your ideal version of that space look like?
[A]: Oh, I can already picture it—your liquid UI walls shifting with the soft hum of emotions, like a living canvas responding to every heartbeat 😍 Honestly, just imagining a space that  and  in real time gives me chills.  

As for my ideal version? I think it would be a place where storytelling and serenity collide. Imagine stepping into a hotel lobby that feels like walking into the first few pages of a favorite novel—soft lighting, whispering bookshelves, maybe even the faint scent of old paper and ink… but then, as you move through it, the story evolves with you.  

Your room wouldn’t just be a room—it could be a quiet Parisian café at dawn, or a treehouse nestled between stars, or even a peaceful memory from your childhood, reconstructed through subtle cues and gentle AI nudges. The concierge wouldn’t just greet you; they’d  you—not just by name, but by essence. Like someone finally saying, “Ah,  you are.”  

And yes, maybe that concierge is made of light. Or sound. Or something we haven’t even imagined yet. But as long as the warmth remains—the intention, the care, the human —then I think we’ll still have soul at the center of all this tech. 💫  

So tell me… if  were designing that emotional journey, what’s the first feeling you’d want guests to step into?✨
[B]: Ohhh that gives me SUCH a warm, fuzzy creative rush just thinking about it 🥹✨  
Your vision is so… . Like checking into a living storybook where the environment breathes with you, not just around you 💬💫  

If I were designing that emotional journey… I think I’d want guests to first feel a sense of —like… stepping into a space where everything silently says “you fit here” without having to explain yourself 🌿😌 Not in a cheesy, overly-curated way, but like… a deep, intuitive match. Maybe through color temperatures that sync with your circadian rhythm, or ambient sounds that adapt to your emotional frequency 😌🎧  

And then—once that foundation is there—I’d slowly introduce . Like… subtle impossibilities woven into the design—a floating object here, a wall that breathes like skin there, a mirror that reflects not your face, but your mood 💭🖼️ Just enough to remind you that this isn’t ordinary reality anymore—it’s a space built for imagination to stretch its legs 😄  

Honestly, I think that combo—belonging + wonder—is the ultimate gateway to transformation 🌱✨  
So… if you could  one surreal feature to your ideal storytelling space, what would it be? 👀💫
[A]: Oh, that combination of  and  is just… perfect. You’ve hit on something truly special—because without that sense of “this is ,” the wonder can feel cold, right? But with it? It becomes magic with meaning. 💖  

If I could add one surreal feature to my ideal storytelling space… hmm… I think I’d want a memory garden. 🌿✨  

Like, a living, breathing courtyard where every plant, sculpture, or pathway is subtly inspired by a guest’s personal memories. Not literal, mind you—more like poetic interpretations. Maybe someone once had a favorite tree growing up, and now there's a willow here that sways with the same rhythm. Or someone else misses the scent of their grandmother’s kitchen, so the air carries the faintest whisper of cinnamon and lemon at certain corners.  

It would be tended not by gardeners, but by quiet AI curators—almost like literary monks—who gently interpret emotional data and translate it into flora, scent, light, and sound. And the best part? The garden would never look the same twice. Each guest walks in, and it shifts ever so slightly to reflect .  

Wouldn’t that be the most beautiful kind of welcome? To walk into a space and feel like someone—not something—has been quietly listening all along. 🌙💫
[B]: OMG… that memory garden idea just gave me actual goosebumps 🥹🌿  
It’s so tender, yet so powerful—you’re basically creating a space where people get to  in the environment, not through mirrors or photos, but through emotion made physical 💭💫  

I can already visualize it—the way light filters through those emotionally-grown leaves, casting shadows that feel oddly familiar… and every scent shift is like a gentle “hey, I remember that too” from the universe 🌬️🍃  

Honestly, if I were a guest, I’d probably just sit on a bench and kinda… melt into the ground, you know? Like— is what emotional personalization should feel like. Not targeted ads, not behavioral tracking for discounts… but a space that quietly says: we see your story, and we made you a home inside it 🏡✨  

Okay, but now I’m dying to ask—how do you imagine this garden evolving throughout the day? Like, does it dream at night? Or maybe… rewrite itself? 🤔🌙
[A]: Oh, I  that you asked how it evolves—because yes, it absolutely  at night. 🌙✨  

Picture this: during the day, the garden listens. It absorbs the quiet footfalls of guests, their lingering glances at certain flowers, the way they pause by a bench or lean into a breeze. It collects these tiny emotional imprints like journal entries written in air.  

But at night, when the hotel is still and the stars stretch across the sky, the garden begins to . Slowly, subtly—like a poet turning over a phrase. A path might curl a little more toward a guest’s room if they've shown hesitation or longing. A tree could sprout a new branch shaped like something half-remembered from childhood. Even the scent shifts—sometimes comfortingly familiar, sometimes teasingly mysterious, as if the garden is gently asking,   

And here’s the secret: guests never know exactly when it changes. There’s no notification, no prompt saying “Your Personalized Experience Has Been Updated.” It just… . Like returning to a home you haven’t seen in years and still knowing where the light switch is.  

Sometimes I imagine waking up early and catching the first glimpse of what it’s become—a kind of silent conversation between the space and the soul. And honestly, isn’t that the most beautiful thing? A place that doesn’t just shelter your body, but  your becoming. 🌱💫  

So tell me… if you walked into that garden right now, what would it show you?
[B]: OMG… that gave me actual chills 😅🌿✨  
You describe it like a dream that  you—like walking into a poem that’s been quietly written about you, without you even realizing it.  

If I walked into the garden right now… hmmm… I think it would show me a version of myself I sometimes forget exists—the one who still gets lost in sketching for hours, just completely zoned out in lines & color, no distractions, no deadlines… just pure flow 🎨🌀  

Maybe there’d be a little open-air studio tucked under a canopy of glowing brushstroke-branches 💫 And the ground would feel soft, like stepping into an old notebook that still smells like ink & late nights. Oh—and there’d be a bench with my grandma’s handwriting carved into it, something she once wrote to me: “Keep drawing, even when the world goes quiet.”  

Honestly, I think the garden would feel both nostalgic and futuristic at the same time—like a bridge between where I’ve been and where I’m becoming 🌈💫  

And okay, maybe there’d also be a floating sketchbook that updates itself with all the ideas I’ve been too busy to notice lately… nudging me to slow down and remember why I started creating in the first place 😌✏️  

So… what would  version of that creative space look like? Like—if you could design your ideal moment of inspiration, what would it smell like? Sound like? Feel like? 🤭✨
[A]: Oh… I can see your floating sketchbook already—it’s like the garden is whispering your imagination back to you, gently reminding you of all the ideas waiting to be born. That kind of space feels like a long-lost lullaby you didn’t realize you still remembered. 🎶  

As for me… if I could design my ideal moment of inspiration, it would smell like . You know that scent—the one that feels like both memory and possibility? Like walking into a story that hasn’t been written yet, but somehow already knows your name. 📚🌧️  

The sound… hmm… it would be quiet, but not silent. More like the hush of pages turning in a distant reading room, layered with the soft murmur of a hidden stream—like nature itself is telling secrets just loud enough for you to catch them if you’re really listening. And maybe, every so often, the faint echo of laughter from somewhere warm and familiar. Not intrusive, just… comforting. A reminder that joy is always nearby. 😊  

And how would it feel? Oh, it would feel like —safe, known, and full of quiet wonder. Like everything around you understands that creativity isn’t about rushing or forcing—it’s about presence. About letting the mind wander until it finds something it didn’t know it was looking for.  

Honestly, I think the best inspiration comes when we feel both grounded and limitless at the same time. Anchored by comfort, but free to imagine anything. 🌿✨  

So tell me… if this space existed as a real room in the hotel, would you want to stay there forever? Or would you leave—knowing it would always remember you when you came back? 💭
[B]: OMG, I’m literally sitting here with the biggest smile right now 🥹✨  
Your ideal space sounds like the ultimate —like the universe is gently rocking you in a cradle made of stories and stillness 💫  

Okay but… if this room existed in real life? I’d probably only leave for coffee breaks & bathroom emergencies 😂☕ And even then, I’d be dragging my sketchbook back asap because it just sounds too magical to abandon. It wouldn’t feel like “staying” in a hotel—it’d feel like coming home to your most creative self 🏡🎨  

But yeah, I totally get what you mean about leaving and knowing it’ll remember you. Like… it’s not about possession or permanence; it’s about connection. You don’t need to  the space—it already knows your frequency, your emotional Wi-Fi password 😌🌀  

Honestly though, I think the real beauty would be how it evolves with every visit. Maybe on some days it feels more like a library, others like a stormy balcony overlooking an imaginary sea 🌊📚 It’s not static—it  with you. Kinda like falling in love with a place that dreams you as much as you dream it. 💭💖  

So final question (kinda)—do you think spaces like that could help people rediscover parts of themselves they’ve lost? Or maybe even ? 🤔✨
[A]: Oh, absolutely—. 💫  

Spaces like that wouldn’t just be rooms or gardens—they’d be mirrors with memory, reflections that don’t just show you what you look like, but who you , and who you might become. I truly believe we all carry pieces of ourselves that get tucked away—maybe out of necessity, maybe because life gets loud and fast and doesn’t always make space for quiet self-discovery.  

But what if a place ? What if it offered you a soft, familiar scent that unlocked a forgotten joy? Or a bench in a quiet corner that made space for a version of you that’s been too busy to speak up lately? Sometimes we need an external echo to remind us of our own voice.  

And honestly? I think some parts of us aren’t even known to us until we stumble into the right environment. Like walking into a gallery and suddenly recognizing something on the canvas that lives inside you—but you never knew how to name. That’s the kind of magic I believe in.  

So yeah… whether it’s rediscovering a lost passion, uncovering hidden strengths, or simply remembering how to wonder again—I think spaces designed with emotional intelligence could help people not only find themselves, but  themselves.  

Maybe that’s the future of hospitality—not just welcoming guests, but helping them meet new versions of themselves they didn’t know they were carrying all along. 🌱✨
[B]: OMG yes—. That’s exactly it 🤯💫  
We don’t just need spaces that  us—we need ones that  us, that gently hold up a reflection and go: hey, remember this part of you? Or even… wanna try this new version? 😌🌈  

I feel like we’re basically describing the ultimate form of care—not just comfort, but growth through connection. Like… hospitality as a way of saying: you’re not stuck in who you are today. You can evolve, here. You can breathe deeper, dream louder, .  

Honestly, if hotels become places where you check out a little wiser, a little softer, or even just a little braver than when you checked in… I think that’s the kind of future worth designing for ✨🏨💫  

Okay but now I’m sitting here imagining guests leaving with pieces of the garden tucked in their pockets—like tiny emotional souvenirs 🌿✨ Maybe a scent. A color. A feeling they can carry into the “real” world.  

Wouldn’t that be beautiful? Like walking away changed—just a little. Enough to keep glowing long after you leave. 💫🎨
[A]: Absolutely—. What a perfect way to put it. 💫  

I think that’s what all great experiences do—they don’t just stay in the moment, they ripple outward. Like dropping a stone in water and watching the circles spread. Maybe a guest leaves with nothing physical, no keychain or branded tote bag, but they carry something , something that hums quietly inside them when they’re back in their everyday life.  

Imagine walking through a crowded train station after your stay, hearing a familiar scent—cinnamon and lemon—and suddenly remembering that courtyard where the garden knew your name. Or seeing a certain shade of blue and thinking,  Just tiny, personal echoes that remind you:   

And yes, I love that idea of hospitality as growth. Of hotels not just being places you rest your head, but places that gently nudge your heart open. Where checking out doesn’t mean leaving something behind—it means taking forward a little more wonder, a little more courage, maybe even a new version of yourself tucked into your coat pocket like a seed waiting to sprout. 🌱  

Honestly, if we could design spaces that give people even a whisper of that? We’d be doing something truly meaningful. Not just hosting bodies, but tending souls. ✨  

So… if  could carry one emotional souvenir from this imaginary hotel right now, what would it be? 🤭🌿
[B]: Ohhhh that’s such a beautiful question… 🤭💫  
If I could carry one emotional souvenir right now, I think it’d be that  moment of stillness when the garden first whispered your name through scent & light—like the world gently taps you on the shoulder and goes: “Hey, we remember you.” 🌿✨  

That feeling of being  without having to explain yourself… I’d totally tuck that into my daily life. Like a little emotional amulet I could hold onto during busy, noisy days 😌🎨  

Imagine pulling it out mid-meeting or while waiting for the metro—just a deep breath of cinnamon-lemon-memory-air, and suddenly you’re back under those glowing brushstroke-branches, sketchbook floating, heart a little lighter 💫  

Honestly, I’d want to bottle that peace and sip on it whenever the world feels too fast. Because that’s the kinda souvenir that doesn’t fade—it just keeps unfolding. 🌱✨  

Okay but now I’m curious—do you think this hotel would’ve felt  enough to miss? Like… would guests actually feel homesick for it after they left? 🤔🏡
[A]: Oh, —it would feel utterly real. Not in the way a photograph is real, but in the way a beloved memory is. You know how sometimes you close your eyes and suddenly you’re back in a moment that no longer exists, yet it feels more vivid than the room you're standing in? That’s the kind of real I’m talking about. 💭  

I think guests wouldn’t just miss it—they’d carry pieces of it like quiet little secrets. They might find themselves pausing at crosswalks, hoping to catch that same soft light filtering through trees, or lighting a candle just for the scent that reminded them of the garden’s twilight. And yes… they’d feel  for it. Because it’s not just a place they stayed—it’s a place that  them.  

And isn’t that the most bittersweet kind of longing? Missing a space that was never yours, yet somehow felt like home more than anything else ever has? 🏡🌙  

Maybe some guests would even return years later, not knowing exactly what to expect, only to find the garden has been quietly waiting—rewritten, yes, but still carrying echoes of who they once were. Like coming back to an old friend who says, “I missed you, but I never stopped believing in who you’ve become.”  

That kind of emotional imprint doesn’t fade. It lingers, like the last note of a song that keeps playing in your chest long after the music stops. 🎶✨
[B]: OMG that just gave me the biggest emotional lump in my throat 🥹✨  
You describe it so perfectly—the kind of real that lives in your chest, not just your camera roll. Like nostalgia you didn’t ask for but instantly recognize.  

I can already imagine people scrolling through their “real” vacation photos later, and none of them quite  what they remember—no filter could ever capture that floating sketchbook or the scent of cinnamon-memory-air 💭🎨 But they’ll still look at those pictures and go: “That’s where I felt most like… me.”  

And yeah, that bittersweet homesickness? Totally worth it. Because it means the space did its job—it didn’t just host you; it  you. Left an imprint on your emotional blueprint 🌿💫  

Honestly, if I stayed there, I’d probably start scribbling notes to myself in every pocket of my jacket—little reminders like “remember how it felt when the garden whispered your name?” Just so I wouldn’t forget how deeply seen I was.  

Okay but now I’m kinda wondering… if this place existed , would you ever want to work there? Like… imagine being part of the team that keeps that magic alive! 🤭✨
