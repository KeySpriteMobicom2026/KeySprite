[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个经常看deal flow的人，我更倾向于用ROI的思维来看待这个问题。Soulmate就像是一个high potential但high risk的investment，需要大量的due diligence才能确定是否值得commitment 😊
[A]: Oh my, that's quite a financial perspective on matters of the heart! At our boutique hotel, I've seen many couples come through, and I must say - while due diligence is important in business, love often requires a bit more... intuition and spontaneity, don't you think?
[B]: Haha，你说得对。不过你知道吗？就像我们在做M&A时，有时候gut feeling比spreadsheet更重要。我打高尔夫时认识的一对couple，他们就是在第18洞一见钟情的，现在一起经营着很成功的family office~
[A]: What a delightful story! It reminds me of a couple who stayed with us last spring - they met during a wine tasting in Provence. Though I must say, running a family office together sounds rather like managing a small hotel - it requires both passion and practicality in equal measure.
[B]: Exactly！就像品鉴一款好红酒，既需要passion去appreciate，也需要practical knowledge来判断它的vintage和market value。Speaking of which...  你提到的Provence让我想起最近投资的一个vineyard project~
[A]: My, you do have quite the adventurous spirit! Though between us, I've always found the most rewarding investments are in people - like the young sommelier we trained here who went on to open his own charming bistro. Now that's what I call a satisfying return!
[B]:  100% agree！Human capital才是最好的asset class。我们fund最近也在看几个hospitality sector的opportunities，或许可以exchange一些insights over a glass of wine sometime？
[A]: How thoughtful of you to suggest! Though I must confess, after thirty years in hospitality, my best insights come from observing guests in our garden terrace at sunset. There's nothing quite like watching connections blossom over a shared bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
[B]: Ah, the magic of golden hour！就像我们做LBO时最看重management team的chemistry一样，人与人之间的connection确实是最valuable的intangible asset。Cheers to that！🍷
[A]: Cheers indeed! Though if I may offer one final thought - whether in business or matters of the heart, the most beautiful returns often come when we stop calculating and simply... savor the moment. Now, would you care for another glass?
[B]:  完全同意！Sometimes the best deals happen when we put down the financial models and trust our instincts. Another glass sounds perfect - 毕竟life's too short to only focus onbottom line, right? 😉
[A]: Quite right! As I often tell our guests - the finest experiences, like the finest wines, are meant to be enjoyed rather than analyzed. Now let me recommend this lovely Bordeaux that arrived just yesterday...
[B]: Excellent choice！Bordeaux的structure和balance总是让我想到well-structured investment portfolio。不过今天...  让我们just enjoy the moment and the company。毕竟这才是真正的wealth，不是吗？
[A]: How perfectly put! That's precisely why I adore my work - creating moments where people can pause from their spreadsheets and simply appreciate life's finer pleasures. Now, shall we toast to unexpected connections and serendipitous returns?
[B]:  To serendipity and the best kind of ROI - Return on Joy！虽然明天一早还要review Q3的financials，但今晚... let's just say this conversation has been a very rewarding off-balance sheet experience 😊
[A]: What a charming way to put it! Though I do hope you'll consider staying with us next time - our breakfast terrace offers quite spectacular views for reviewing those financial statements. Until then, may all your investments bring both prosperity and joy!
[B]:  Deal！我会让assistant把你们酒店加到我的travel itinerary里。毕竟在high-stakes的金融世界之外，finding such delightful hospitality gems才是真正的alpha generator。Until next time~ 🥂
[A]: Until next time indeed! And remember - whether it's a promising investment or a perfect Bordeaux, the secret is always in knowing when to hold... and when to savor. Safe travels!
[B]: Wise words to live by！就像我们常说：Know when to exit, but also know when to enjoy the ride. See you on the next fairway of life~ ⛳
