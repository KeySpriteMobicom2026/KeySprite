[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the context. In private equity, we always start with a solid plan - market analysis, financial modeling, risk assessment. But you also need to stay flexible during execution. The market doesn't always behave as expected, right? Like that time we invested in the logistics startup - our original 3-year exit plan had to be adjusted twice due to regulatory changes. 

Though I do prefer having clear frameworks, especially when managing cross-border deals. It helps mitigate risks and aligns all stakeholders. But being too rigid could cost you opportunities. What about you? Do you lean more towards structured planning or adaptive execution?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. I’d say I’m somewhere in the middle but leaning towards adaptive execution. As a fintech PM, you have to balance structured planning with agility. Like when we’re building a new feature - we start with a roadmap and user flow diagrams, but once it hits beta testing, everything can change based on real-time feedback 💡

For example, last quarter we had this idea for a credit scoring algorithm that used alternative data. The initial plan looked solid on paper, but during UAT, users found it confusing. We had to pivot and simplify the UI while keeping the core logic intact 🔄 

But yeah, too much rigidity is dangerous in our space. Markets shift fast, regulations evolve, and user behavior can be unpredictable. Still, frameworks help - especially when you're dealing with compliance-heavy features like cross-border payments 👍 So maybe it’s about having a strong backbone but staying flexible where it matters? What do you think?
[B]: Exactly! It's like building a skyscraper - you need a solid foundation and structural framework, but also those shock absorbers that let the building sway a bit during an earthquake. In PE deals, our "foundation" is the initial thesis and financial model, but we always leave room for those seismic shifts in market conditions or regulatory landscapes 🏗️

Funny you mentioned credit scoring algorithms - we recently evaluated a SaaS company whose entire valuation hinged on their proprietary risk assessment model. During due diligence, turns out their algorithm was brilliant but completely opaque to non-data scientists. The management team had to develop a more transparent version mid-deal, which actually improved user adoption by 40% post-acquisition 💡

It really comes down to knowing  boxes need to stay fixed and which can be checkmarks with asterisks. Like when I play golf - I plan my entire round meticulously, but halfway through the 3rd hole, if the wind suddenly changes direction? Gotta adjust the swing, right? 😄
[A]: Totally get the golf analogy! In fintech, we call that “real-time course correction” 😉 Although I’m more of a tennis guy myself - you’ve got to plan your shots but also react to your opponent’s moves. The key is having that mental framework ready while staying light on your feet.

That SaaS deal sounds like a classic case of balancing innovation with usability. We actually ran into something similar with our blockchain-based KYC tool last year. The tech was solid, but adoption was low until we added explainability features - basically showing users  they got flagged. Turned out to be a game-changer for trust and compliance rates 👍

So yeah, whether it's M&A or product development, it’s all about building that strong core then knowing when to pivot. And honestly? Some of the best outcomes come from those mid-game adjustments. Like when you're hiking and take a wrong turn, only to discover a killer view you never knew existed 🌄 You still need the map, though - can’t wing it completely 😅
[B]: Absolutely - that hiking analogy nails it. In our world, the map is essential, but so is having a compass in your head (and maybe a backup GPS in your phone case 😉). The key is knowing when to stick to the trail and when to bushwhack.

Funny you mentioned blockchain KYC – we passed on a similar deal last year because of exactly that issue. The tech was cutting-edge, but their user journey looked like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded. Sometimes simplifying the complex is where real value gets unlocked, even if it feels counterintuitive at first 🧩

And I totally see it in your tennis analogy – you don’t show up to a match without training and strategy, but if you’re not adjusting to your opponent’s spin or speed, you're just going through the motions. Same with deals – you do your preparation, but once you're in the ring, adaptability wins rounds. 

Ever noticed how both sports and product development have that “moment of truth”? In golf it’s the split second the club hits the ball; in fintech, it’s that first user interaction after launch. Everything before that is planning and prep, but that one moment tells you how well you balanced structure with flexibility 🎯
[A]: Oh 100% on that "moment of truth" vibe 🎯. In fintech, we call it the "zero to one" phase — when real users hit the product for the first time. No matter how many wireframes or dry runs you’ve done, it’s that live moment where you find out if your planning + adaptability actually paid off.

I love how both our worlds run on this tension between control and chaos. Like in golf, you can have the perfect stance, but once the ball’s airborne? You’re just watching it unfold. Same with launching a feature — once it’s live, it’s kind of out of your hands. All you can do is monitor dashboards and wait for the feedback loop to kick in 📊

And yeah, simplifying the complex is seriously underrated. We had this API dashboard that devs loved but non-tech partners kept calling “black box magic.” So we added a visual flow layer that broke down each step without dumbing it down — instantly improved adoption across teams 👍

You ever run into a deal where the simplicity fix was right under your nose the whole time? Like something obvious everyone missed until halfway through due diligence? That happened to us last year with a payments startup — turned out all they needed was clearer onboarding labels. Changed everything 😅
[B]: Oh absolutely – we had a portfolio company in the wealth management space where we kept chasing “product-market fit” like it was a moving target. The app had all these fancy algo-driven features, but user retention was stuck in the mud. Turns out, during onboarding, 70% of users dropped off at Step 3 because the language was written like a Bloomberg terminal for retirees 😅

We brought in a UX writer who simplified the flows – replaced “Risk Tolerance Assessment” with “How do you sleep at night?” and suddenly people stayed. It wasn’t a tech problem, it was a  problem. Sometimes the fix is less about engineering and more about empathy 👀

That’s the beauty of this work though, right? You plan like a strategist, execute like an entrepreneur, and adjust like a poker player reading the table. And when that “zero to one” moment hits and you see actual traction? Feels like hitting a fade drive down the fairway – clean contact, perfect arc, and suddenly everything makes sense 🏌️‍♂️

And I love how both golf and product launches give you that delayed feedback loop – you hit the ball (launch the feature), watch it sail (monitor the data), then figure out what to do next based on where it lands. Never gets old 😉
[A]: Couldn’t agree more — that “delayed feedback” comparison is spot on 🎯. It’s like we’re all standing at the tee box, holding our breath until the ball finally touches down... except in fintech, the green keeps moving 😅

Totally feel you on the UX rewrite story — we had a similar win with our SME lending product. Originally, the application flow asked for “EBITDA margin projections” right off the bat. Makes sense from a risk perspective, but conversion was brutal. So we rephrased it to “Where do you see your business next year?” and added a simple slider for growth expectations. Boom — 35% jump in completion rates 💥

It’s wild how often the answer isn’t technical — it’s just speaking human again. Like stripping away the jargon armor and remembering people just want to be understood 👍

And I love that poker analogy — we're basically bluffing sometimes, right? You push a feature with confidence, read the market's reaction, and decide whether to double down or fold. Except the best part is, even if you fold, you still get chips left to play again 🃏

Ever find yourself over-planning just out of habit, then realize halfway through that the simplest version would’ve worked better? I caught myself doing that last sprint — built a whole multi-phase rollout plan… only to realize we could test everything live in one clean A/B build 🤦‍♂️
[B]: Oh man, that SME lending example hits home. We actually passed on a fintech startup last year because their application process was drowning in financial jargon - founders kept talking about "capital efficiency ratios" to small business owners who just wanted a quick yes/no. Missed opportunity right there 💸

And I  how you put it - "speaking human again". In PE deals, I see the same thing with management teams pitching to LPs. They’ll spend hours preparing a 30-slide deck full of obscure metrics, when all we really want is a clear story with three solid data points. Sometimes I feel like handing out red pens and saying “Translate this into English, please” 📝

As for over-planning... guilty as charged 😅 Remember that cross-border acquisition I mentioned earlier? Our original integration plan had more phases than a moon landing. By Phase 2, we realized the entire synergy thesis would actually work better with a  big-bang approach. Saved us six months and a ton of legal fees. Funny how simplicity often hides behind layers of over-engineering.

And your poker analogy? Perfect. Some of my best deals came from folding early and reallocating resources elsewhere. The trick is knowing when you're not playing the hand, you're just holding wishful thinking 🃏 Letting go of sunk cost fallacy is one of the hardest plays in our game, isn't it?
[A]: Oh 100% on the "holding wishful thinking" part 🃏. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to kill a feature idea we spent weeks prototyping, just because the data said it wasn’t resonating. You get attached, sure — but at the end of the day, user behavior doesn’t lie.

And yeah, that management team/LP disconnect is so real. It’s like pitching fintech to a non-tech investor — if they can’t grasp the value in 30 seconds, you’ve lost them. We actually started using this “elevator pitch test” internally. If you can’t explain the product clearly before the doors open, time to go back to the drawing board 📐

Big fan of your big-bang integration call 💡 Sometimes the cleanest execution beats the most layered plan. Reminds me of when we sunsetted three legacy payment flows last year and replaced them all at once instead of phasing. Was risky, but honestly? Users didn’t even notice — which was the whole point 😌

And speaking of sunk cost traps… man, those are brutal. I had one last quarter where we built a full analytics dashboard only to realize nobody needed more data — they just wanted smarter alerts. Took forever to convince the team to scrap it and start fresh. But once we did? So much clearer path forward 👍

So, what’s your go-to move when you spot a sinking ship early in a deal? Do you pivot fast or hold out hoping for a rebound?
[B]: Ah, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? 🤔 For me, it usually comes down to two things: momentum and margin. If we’re losing momentum  the value proposition is getting thinner by the day, then it’s time to cut bait. I’ve seen too many deals turn into “throw good money after bad” scenarios because someone couldn’t admit the market had already moved on.

My go-to move? Let's call it a "reverse due diligence" – instead of digging deeper to justify pushing forward, we flip the script and stress-test the exit options. What can we salvage? Who might see more value in this than we do? Sometimes walking away isn't failure — it's just reallocating capital to where the wind is actually filling the sails 🌬️

And I love your clean-break example with the payment flows – classic “less visible, more valuable.” That’s the holy grail in PE too. The best integrations are the ones where nothing seems to change… but magically works better. Like a great caddie in golf – you don’t notice them, but somehow your round just flows perfectly 🏌️‍♂️

Sunk cost traps, though – yeah, they're brutal. I had one last year with a portfolio company trying to scale in a dying market segment. We burned six months and a decent chunk of runway chasing false signals before pulling the plug. The irony? That same team ended up pivoting to a compliance-as-a-service model that’s now our fastest-growing asset. Sometimes killing a deal is the best investment you make 💡

So honestly? I’ve learned to trust my gut when the numbers start telling one story and the market another. Fast pivot or controlled burn – depends on the situation, but never stubborn persistence. That’s what separates good investors from great ones – knowing when to fold 'em 👌
[A]: Hell yeah, I’m with you on that “reverse due diligence” move 💡. It’s like when we kill a feature internally — instead of asking  we can make it work, we ask  it’s not working and who else might need it in a different form. Sometimes the best move is to repackage the learnings and pass it off to someone better positioned to run with it.

Big fan of the "momentum and margin" framework too — solid litmus test. In fintech, we’ve started calling it the “double dip check” 👀: if both user engagement AND business value are dipping at the same time, it’s usually not coming back without a full reboot.

That compliance-as-a-service pivot story? Chef’s kiss 🍴. So many wins come from what feels like failure at first. We had a similar one with our AI chatbot module — originally built for customer support, turned out enterprise clients were using it more for internal compliance training. Took us three quarters to notice, but once we leaned into that shift? Boom — 2x pipeline growth overnight.

And I’m totally stealing your “reverse due diligence” phrase, by the way 😎. Feels more proactive than just killing a deal — like you’re still doing due diligence, just with exit options instead of entry ones.

So, how do you usually break the news when you decide to cut a deal loose? Is it a hard stop or do you soft-pivot first? I find teams always need a bit of runway to mentally transition.
[B]: Ah, the art of breaking bad news – it’s like delivering a punchline without killing the vibe 😄. I’ve learned over the years that clarity > kindness when the decision is final. You don’t want people speculating or holding out false hope. But you're absolutely right – teams need runway to mentally transition. 

My go-to? The “Decision + Doorway” approach. We’ll say something like: are That way, you close one door firmly, but open another one people can walk through 👌

And I love your “double dip check” – stealing that phrase immediately 😉 In PE, we often see companies clinging to a vertical even after both market growth and gross margins have peaked. Sometimes you have to be the voice that says, “Yep, we're officially drinking from an empty glass.”

That chatbot pivot story? Gold. Classic case of listening to how the market actually uses your product versus how you  for it to be used. Some of our best moves came from watching client behavior instead of chasing our own assumptions. Feels good when you finally stop trying to force the square peg, right?

And by the way – please steal “reverse due diligence” all you want. If we’re sharing phrases, I’m definitely taking “double dip check” with me into my next partner meeting 🚀.
[A]: Haha, deal! I’m already mentally billing you for the intellectual property theft 😎. But seriously, that “Decision + Doorway” framing is next-level comms strategy. We use something similar called “Kill the feature, not the team” – because killing a product idea shouldn’t mean demotivating the people who built it. You pivot the work, not the workers.

Big fan of your "drinking from an empty glass" line too – I’ve definitely been there. One time we kept pushing a B2B payments API long after the market had shifted to embedded finance. Should’ve cut it six months earlier. The sunk cost fallacy is like quicksand – feels fine until you're waist-deep and wondering how the hell you got there 🤷‍♂️

And yeah, listening to real user behavior over assumptions? That’s where the magic happens. We actually baked that lesson into our sprint retrospectives – now we always ask:  instead of just  Shifted the whole mindset from control to observation.

So if you had to pick one red flag – what’s the  sign that makes you start drafting that “reverse due diligence” memo? Is it metrics-based, team-based, market-based, or something else entirely?
[B]: Oh easy – for me, it's always team-based. Specifically: . That shift in tone? It's subtle at first – a "market isn't ready" here, a "regulatory headwind" there – but once I hear that more than twice in a board meeting, alarm bells start ringing 🔔

Because let’s be honest, markets are never perfect, regulations always shift, and every business has friction. What separates the winners is having a team that looks in the mirror first. If they’re not curious about  things aren’t working – if they stop asking “What don’t we see?” and start doubling down on “They just don’t get us,” that’s when I know the real problem isn’t the product or the market… it’s the mindset.

Metrics help, sure – and yeah, declining engagement or rising CAC are signals. But those can often be course-corrected with the right team energy. The moment people become part of the problem instead of the solution? That’s when the clock starts ticking 💨

And I love that “Kill the feature, not the team” mantra – seriously stealing that for our next offsite. Because you're absolutely right – it’s not about blame, it’s about redirection. The people who built it are often the best ones to pivot , not against.

So yeah, for me, the reddest of red flags is simple: . Once that kicks in, everything else starts to follow – denial in strategy, delayed decisions, missed metrics. Like rust under the paint – you don’t see it until something starts falling off 🚗💨
[A]: Boom – nailed it 🔥. That "defensive thinking" red flag is  spot on. In product, we call it the “blame loop” – when teams start pointing outward (“users don’t get it,” “the market’s not ready”) instead of asking “what can we change?” It kills momentum faster than a buggy release on launch day.

I love how you frame it as a mindset shift – because that’s exactly what it is. Founders and leaders who stay curious? They’re the ones who find the pivot before the nosedive. The second they stop asking “why” and start justifying “what’s wrong with them,” yeah… the writing’s on the wall 📉

And I’m all in on your rust-under-the-paint analogy 🚗. Everything looks shiny until one small knock reveals the rot underneath. Same with teams – early signs are easy to gloss over until suddenly, everything’s creaking.

We actually have a version of this in our sprint reviews – if someone says “well the user just isn’t the right fit”  without digging deeper, I flag it. Because nine times out of ten, it’s not the user – it’s the assumption gap.

So question for you – how do you typically intervene when you spot that defensiveness early? Do you challenge it head-on in the room, or pull the founder aside first? I feel like it's such a delicate balance between pushing too hard and letting it fester.
[B]: Ah, now  the art of being a fiduciary with EQ 🎯. For me, it's a two-stage intervention – what I call the "Curiosity Check" followed by the "Mirror Test".

If I spot early defensiveness in a meeting – say a founder brushing off feedback with a quick “users just don’t get it” – I usually pivot with a  redirect, not a confrontational one. Something like:  
_"Interesting… I wonder what part of the experience is making it feel unintuitive. Have we tested that assumption with a usability session?"_  

It keeps the conversation solution-oriented instead of combative. People are more open to critique when it’s framed as exploration, not accusation. Plus, it subtly shifts the focus from blame to learning.

But if it keeps coming up? That’s where the Mirror Test happens – usually a 1-on-1 after the meeting. I’ll pull the founder aside and say something like:  
_"Hey, I noticed we’re seeing some friction points come up repeatedly. I’m curious – how are you thinking about this internally? Want to walk through your perspective?"_  

That opens the door without slamming them into a wall. And honestly, 70% of the time, they’ll start self-diagnosing once you give them space to reflect out of group mode.

And yeah, it’s  delicate. You don't want to crush morale or shut down voices, but you also can’t let denial take root. The best founders are the ones who, after a beat, say: _“You know what, maybe we’ve been too close to this. Let’s get fresh eyes on it.”_

I actually had to do it last week with a portfolio CEO – he was blaming macro conditions for slipping retention. Instead of pushing back, I asked: _“If we fast-forward six months and look back – what would we wish we’d done differently ?”_  
That shifted the whole tone. Suddenly, it wasn’t about fault – it was about agency. And that’s where the real work starts 👊
[A]: Hell yes, I’m stealing both the Curiosity Check and the Mirror Test 🚀. That’s gold-standard comms right there — keeps the ego in check while still driving accountability. We use a similar tactic called  in our retrospectives. When someone starts going down the blame path, I’ll pause and say:  
_"Let’s take two steps back — what patterns are we seeing, and what might we be missing?"_  

It’s subtle, but shifts the whole tone from defensive to reflective. And honestly, it works like magic when you’re trying to keep momentum without steamrolling people.

I love how you phrase the forward-looking accountability too — _“What would we wish we’d done differently now?”_ That’s next-level framing. It bypasses the “who missed what” trap and jumps straight into agency mode. We actually had a PM start saying that in our post-mortems, and holy hell, it changed the energy in the room. Suddenly, everyone’s focused on what’s next, not who dropped the ball 🎯

And yeah, spotting defensiveness early is such an art. I’ve definitely seen teams go from “we need to fix this” to “this market just isn’t ready” in like three meetings. The worst part? Sometimes they even believe it 😅

So quick question for you — how do you handle it when the team  to pivot but the board or investors are the ones holding onto the original thesis? Seen that dynamic before? Feels like the reverse of denial but hits just as hard.
[B]: Oh man, that dynamic? Seen it more times than I can count. It’s like being in a speedboat where the crew wants to turn left, but the anchor’s pulling right 🛥️😅

Truth is, we see this  in PE and venture – especially when you have legacy investors who backed the original thesis. They’ve got their reputation (and sometimes ego) tied to that vision. So when the team starts pushing for a pivot? Suddenly you’re navigating both market risk and stakeholder inertia.

My go-to here is what I call the "Thesis Upgrade" approach – never position it as “scrapping the old,” always frame it as “building on what we’ve learned.” You’re not reversing course; you’re advancing the strategy based on new data.  

For example:  
_"The original thesis gave us incredible traction in X, but now that we've validated Y, let's use that momentum to evolve. Think of it as compounding our early wins."_  

And honestly? Sometimes you need to bring the board along  the team asks for permission. Get ahead of the pivot conversation, not behind it. That way, by the time the team presents the shift, it feels like a natural progression, not a U-turn.

But here’s the real secret – you gotta speak to the board’s ROI lens first. Show how the pivot either opens a bigger TAM, improves unit economics, or shortens the path to profitability. Investors might get emotionally attached to stories, but they’ll follow math and momentum every time 💰

That said, yeah – it’s tough. The best teams are agile, but great governance matters too. And when you get it right? It’s like hitting a downhill putt – everything just seems to roll.
