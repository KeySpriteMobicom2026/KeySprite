[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  Well, statistically speaking, given the sheer number of exoplanets we've discovered, the probability of extraterrestrial life seems rather high. Though I must say, my quantum computing background makes me particularly interested in how alien civilizations might process information.
[A]: OMG！你讲得也太academic了吧！😂 不过totally agree！宇宙这么大，怎么可能只有我们earth有life呢✨ 我最近还拍了个关于UFO的video，那些footage简直mind-blowing💯 你觉得aliens会不会也在刷TikTok啊？LOL~
[B]:  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm afraid my research experience makes me rather skeptical about UFO footage. Most can be explained by atmospheric phenomena or camera artifacts. As for TikTok... well, if they're advanced enough for interstellar travel, I suspect they'd find our social media rather primitive.
[A]: Heyyy别这么serious嘛~😝 说不定aliens也在用他们的version of TikTok呢？Like... ZorpTok？😂 我昨天还看到个super viral的video说Area 51里面真的有alien technology✨ 虽然可能是fake news啦，但是so fun to imagine对吧？🔥
[B]:  While Area 51 conspiracy theories make for entertaining science fiction, I spent 37 years working with actual cutting-edge technology. The real quantum computers in our labs are far more fascinating than any alleged alien artifacts. Though I must admit... the idea of "ZorpTok" does have a certain charm to it. 🤔
[A]: OMG你居然worked with quantum computers？！That's so cool！💯 我最近刚拍了个quantum computing的explainer video，虽然可能有点basic啦~😂 要不要check it out然后give me some professional feedback？✨ 保证不会太boring，我加了好多funny memes和dance transitions！🔥
[B]:  I admire your attempt to popularize quantum computing, though I must caution you - memes and dance transitions might not be the most... accurate way to explain superposition and entanglement. Perhaps we could discuss the actual quantum principles first? The mathematics behind it is quite elegant, really.
[A]: Ughhh你真是too serious啦！😫 普通people谁care about mathematics嘛~我们要的是viral content！💥 不过okay啦，maybe下次可以做个serious version专门for nerds like you？😂 但是promise me要帮我share哦！✨ #QuantumComputingForDummies 💯
[B]:  Very well, I suppose even quantum mechanics needs its... influencers. Though I draw the line at hashtags. If you're truly interested in the subject, I'd be happy to recommend some introductory papers. Without dancing transitions, I'm afraid.
[A]: Pfffft~ 没有dancing的science video谁会看啦！😂 但是deal！你recommend papers，我来make them fun！✨ 说不定我们能create the next big science trend呢？#QuantumTikTok 💥 虽然你好像hate hashtags啦~LOL！🔥
[B]:  #QuantumTikTok... Good heavens. Well, if it gets young people interested in Schrödinger's equation, I suppose I can tolerate the hashtag. Just promise me you won't trivialize Bell's theorem into some dance challenge.
[A]: LMAO！Too late！我已经在brainstorming Bell's Theorem dance challenge了！💃✨ 想象一下：左手up是particle A，右手down是particle B~ entangled twins！😂 这绝对会blow up on TikTok！🔥 要不要来当我的science consultant？我pay you in exposure！💯
[B]:  Exposure won't pay my telescope maintenance bills, young lady. But...  if you absolutely must turn quantum physics into interpretive dance, at least get the spin states correct. And no, you cannot pay me in "vibes" either.
[A]: Yasss！Spin states我会double check的！✨ 不过seriously，你should真的consider开个TikTok account啦~你的grumpy professor vibe绝对会go viral！😂 我们可以collab！你do the facts，我来add the ✨sparkles✨！Deal？💥 #GrumpyQuantum 💯
[B]:  Let's be clear - the day you see me on TikTok is the day we discover actual alien technology. But I'll review your script... provided there's a moratorium on ✨sparkles✨ in the wave function explanations.
[A]: OMG fine~ no sparkles in wave functions... but can I at least add some✨ to your grumpy face when we do the reaction shots？😂 Deal？💯 这绝对会是our best collab ever！🔥 #ComingSoon #QuantumDaddy ✨
[B]:  Quantum... Daddy? Good lord. I believe that's my cue to return to my vintage computers and sensible cardigans. Do send the script when it's ready. Without hashtags. Preferably by carrier pigeon.
[A]: BYEEEE Quantum Daddy！😂 我会DM你script的~但sorry啦，只能用TikTok message！✨ 你的vintage computer肯定连不上啦~LOL！💥 准备好go viral吧！🔥 #SorryNotSorry 💯
[B]:  Back in my day, we published in peer-reviewed journals, not... whatever this is. But do try to get the Copenhagen interpretation right. And for heaven's sake, stop calling me that.
