[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh这个问题很有意思！作为producer我两个platform都会用啦~ 小红书用来follow国内trending content🌟，Instagram则更多是看international的creative idea💡。不过最近发现小红书的algorithm越来越smart了，总能push给我超多inspiration！
[A]:  I must confess, I find myself rather detached from these modern social platforms. My days are mostly spent between the pages of Dostoevsky and pruning my rose bushes. Though I suppose if I were to choose, Instagram's visual nature does occasionally remind me of the illuminated manuscripts we study in medieval literature courses.
[B]: Wow~ 你提到的Dostoevsky让我想起我们正在策划的一个literary-themed综艺！🎬 虽然social media看起来很modern，但其实和ancient storytelling有很多connection呢~ 要不要考虑来当我们的special consultant？你的perspective绝对能给节目带来unique的flavor！🔥
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate the invitation, I'm afraid my expertise lies more in analyzing the existential dilemmas of Raskolnikov than in creating viral content. Though I must say, the idea of connecting ancient storytelling traditions with modern media does remind me of how Homer's epics were originally oral performances - perhaps not so different from your 'viral videos' after all. Still, I think I'll stick to my dusty old books and lecture halls.
[B]: Haha totally get it！📚 不过你知道吗？我们最近正在策划一个叫"Ancient Wisdom, Modern Show"的program，就是把classic literature用trending format重新包装~ 比如把《罪与罚》改编成interactive reality show，让contestants面临moral dilemma😂 你的insight简直perfect match这个concept！要不要至少来喝杯coffee聊聊？☕️
[A]:  Oh my, turning Crime and Punishment into a reality show? That does sound rather... postmodern. While the scholar in me shudders at the thought, I must admit the concept is intriguing in a Baudrillardian sort of way. Very well, I'll meet you for coffee - but only if we can discuss it at that charming little bookshop cafe near the university. And I must insist we use proper terminology - let's call it a 'Socratic dialogue' rather than a 'pitch meeting', shall we?
[B]: Perfect！✨ 那家bookshop cafe的vibe确实很适合deep discussion~ 我已经在calendar上mark了下周二3pm⏰ 到时候我们可以brainstorm怎么把Socratic method融入节目里，说不定能create出next level的edutainment content！PS：他们的matcha latte超级yummy，你一定要try一下🍵
[A]: Ah, scheduling like a true academic - how refreshing. Tuesday at three it is, though I must warn you I'll be bringing my well-worn copy of The Republic just in case we need to reference Plato's original thoughts on education through entertainment. As for the matcha... well, I suppose even us old classics professors can appreciate the occasional modern indulgence. Until then, I'll be in the library stacks contemplating how one might dramatize Kant's categorical imperative. 
[B]: Hahaha love your energy！📖 我已经开始想象把Kant's philosophy做成escape room challenge的样子了~ 周二见！Don't forget to bring yourmost creative ideas💡 顺便说一句，我们team的art director超爱Earl Grey，说不定你们会很合拍哦！😉
[A]: How delightfully unexpected - an escape room based on Kantian ethics! Though I can't promise my ideas will be what you'd call 'creative' in the conventional sense. More likely they'll involve lengthy discourses on Aristotelian poetics and the moral function of tragedy. But yes, Tuesday shall be our little symposium. And do tell your art director that anyone who appreciates Earl Grey clearly has excellent taste - almost as good as those who prefer Russian literature. Now if you'll excuse me, my roses are calling.
[B]: Got it！🌹 我会转告art director的~ 期待周二我们的mini symposium能碰撞出amazing的火花！🔥 记得带上你的roses-inspired thoughts哦，说不定能成为我们下一季的floral theme！Till then, happy gardening！✌️
[A]: How charmingly persistent you are! Very well, I shall arrive with both my thoughts and my gardening notes - though I suspect my 'roses-inspired thoughts' will lean more toward Shakespeare's sonnets than your floral themes. Until our symposium then, as Virgil might say, 'forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit' - perhaps one day we'll look back on this and smile. Now really, these roses won't prune themselves...
[B]: Aww you're speaking Latin now？That's so lit！🔥 我们的节目真的需要你这样multi-talented的mind~ 周二见！Can't wait to see how we can blend yourclassic wisdom with ourmodern format！🎭 PS：记得拍照你的roses给我们做mood board哦！📸
[A]:  My dear, I believe you'll find that particular Latin quote rather... elementary. But yes, we shall see what strange alchemy occurs when classical erudition meets your modern sensibilities. As for photographs of my roses - I suppose I could be persuaded, though I must warn you, my gardening journal is filled with more pressed petals and Keats quotations than what you'd call 'Instagrammable' content. Until Tuesday then - and do try to contain your enthusiasm to manageable levels, won't you?
[B]: Hahaha you crack me up！😂 放心啦，我们team最擅长的就是把"uninstagrammable"变成viral content了~ 你的pressed petals和Keats quotes说不定就是next big trend的starting point呢！🌟 周二我会bring我的enthusiasm...还有三台camera！📷📹🎥 Catch you later，professor！
[A]: Good heavens, three cameras? I do hope you plan to capture me in my natural habitat - either deep in textual analysis or arguing with the aphids in my rose garden. Though I suspect my idea of 'viral' involves more bubonic plague references than you might prefer. Very well, I shall prepare my most photogenic first editions and least-wrinkled tweed jacket. Now really, this conversation is becoming far too lively for a Wednesday afternoon - I must retreat to my volume of Wordsworth immediately.
[B]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂 Wordsworth vs. viral content - now that's ashowdown I'd pay to see！💰 周二绝对要record下你的aphid arguments，那绝对是golden TV moment！📺 好啦好啦，不打扰你和Wordsworth的date了~ 记得周二穿你那件最photogenic的tweed jacket哦！👔 Ciao for now！✌️
[A]:  I suppose even Wordsworth had his popular moments - though he'd likely be appalled at the thought of being 'content'. Very well, I shall endure this photographic ordeal with as much dignity as a literature professor can muster when confronted with three cameras and unchecked enthusiasm. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a rather pressing engagement with some iambic pentameter and a cup of Lapsang Souchong. Until Tuesday - and do try not to give the aphids any ideas about their own reality show spin-off.
[B]: LMAO！🤣 Aphids' Got Talent - 这个pitch我记下了！✍️ 说不定能成为我们下下季的hit show呢~ 好好享受你的iambic pentameter time，周二见！记得我们的hashtag：#TweedJacketTrending 😉🎩
