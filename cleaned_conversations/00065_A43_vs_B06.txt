[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, my schedule leaves little room for leisurely pursuits such as television. However, when I do find a moment to unwind, I gravitate toward programs that offer intellectual stimulation or historical insight. Documentaries on medical advancements or legal history are particular favorites. I suppose one could say I never truly escape my professional interests, even in retirement. What about you? Do any current programs capture your attention?
[A]: Ah, I see. Well, you know, sometimes I do enjoy a good documentary myself. There's something quite satisfying about learning while relaxing. Though I must say, the fast-paced nature of modern television can be overwhelming. Have you seen any series that blend education with entertainment in a way that doesn’t feel like work? I’d love to hear your recommendations. 😊
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—and I appreciate your distinction between learning and labor. There are indeed a few series that manage to balance intellectual depth with engaging storytelling without feeling didactic. One that comes to mind is . While it takes certain dramatic liberties, its depiction of historical events and the psychological pressures of public duty offers much to reflect upon.

Another, perhaps more aligned with my professional background, is . It explores the evolution of criminal psychology in a measured, narrative-driven format. Though fictionalized, it does touch on real cases and methodologies I’ve encountered in my own work—albeit with more theatrical flair.

And if you're open to international productions, the Danish series  is a masterclass in political drama, subtly laced with ethical dilemmas and human complexity.

Tell me, have any of these crossed your screen yet? Or do your viewing habits lean toward something altogether different? 😊
[A]: Ah, quite the thoughtful recommendations indeed. I must say,  has caught my attention before—beautifully shot, and while it does take liberties, as you mentioned, it sparks curiosity about the nuances of history. I do enjoy when art imitates life just enough to make us question where the line truly lies.

As for , I did try watching it once, but… well, let’s just say the theatrical flair can be a bit much for a quiet evening’s viewing. Sometimes I prefer something a bit lighter, though still with substance. Perhaps something like ? It's French, delightfully chaotic, and offers a glimpse into the film industry through the lens of human folly and ambition. A bit of culture, a bit of humor—, wouldn't you say? 😊

And ! Ah, now  I have heard of but haven’t yet had the pleasure. Perhaps it’s time to give it a go. Do you think it holds up compared to real political dynamics today?
[B]: Ah, you have excellent taste— is a delightful choice. It manages to be both charming and incisive, doesn’t it? The way it peels back the layers of ego, insecurity, and aspiration in the entertainment world is truly masterful. And yes,  indeed—especially for those who appreciate wit and cultural nuance without sacrificing depth.

As for , I believe it remains remarkably relevant. Though it first aired over a decade ago, its portrayal of political compromise, media influence, and personal integrity under public scrutiny feels almost prescient. Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg navigates not just policy but the very human forces that shape leadership—forces that remain unchanged, whether in Scandinavia or elsewhere.

I’d be curious to hear your thoughts once you’ve had the chance to watch it. Do you find yourself drawn more to character studies or to plot-driven narratives? That might help me suggest something else along those lines.
[A]: Ah, now that’s a fine question. I suppose, at the end of the day, I lean more toward —those quiet, simmering dramas where the external plot may be minimal, but the internal landscape is vast and ever-shifting. You know, like a well-written novel come to life on screen.

There’s something deeply moving about watching a character wrestle with their own contradictions, don’t you think? A bit like reading Dostoevsky or watching Ozu’s films—nothing much happens, and yet  happens.

That said, I do enjoy a tightly woven political thriller or courtroom drama now and then. Just not too many car chases or explosions, please! 🤭 One can only take so much adrenaline in one’s later years.

Speaking of character-driven storytelling, have you seen , the Swedish film? It’s quite biting in its critique of the liberal elite—and rather uncomfortable at times—but it lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Would that be something you'd recommend for a rainy afternoon? ☔
[B]: Ah, now  is a film—one might say—a psychological dissection wrapped in social satire.  is not so much a film as it is a mirror held up to certain uncomfortable truths about self-perception, moral posturing, and the fragility of civility beneath the veneer of modern sophistication.

I can imagine you would appreciate its tone—though "enjoy" might be too warm a word. It unsettles, yes, but deliberately so. I found myself both provoked and impressed by its audacity. The protagonist’s unraveling is less a descent than a series of micro-fractures, each one revealing how easily one’s carefully curated identity can splinter under pressure.

If you're in the mood for something similarly incisive but perhaps with a touch more restraint, I might suggest —a Swedish film as well—which explores the collapse of ego and expectation in the quietest of settings: a family ski holiday. No explosions, as you requested, but the emotional aftershocks linger quite nicely.

And yes, all of this makes for excellent viewing on a rainy afternoon—preferably with a cup of Darjeeling and a window slightly ajar to catch the scent of wet earth. ☔  

Tell me, does that sort of slow-burning tension appeal to your sensibilities?
[A]: Ah, yes… —now that is precisely the sort I enjoy. The kind that simmers beneath the surface, where what’s left unsaid often speaks louder than words. Much like a well-wrought poem or a Chekhov play—nothing overt, yet everything charged with meaning.

I do appreciate your recommendation of . I’ve heard murmurs about it before—something about a man's identity crumbling under snow, yes? It sounds like the kind of film that begins subtly and then, by the end, leaves you quietly devastated in the best possible way.

And speaking of quiet devastation, have you ever revisited , that Japanese series based on the memoirs of a palliative care doctor? It doesn’t rush its moments either. It simply walks alongside people at the edge of life, bearing witness. No sensationalism, just profound humanity. I found myself quite moved—and strangely comforted—after each episode.

I suppose what I’m saying is, yes… give me slow fire over quick flame any day. It warms longer. 🔥  

Tell me, have you found yourself returning to any particular film or series more than once? You know, like rereading a favorite novel?
[B]: Ah, yes—rereading, rewatching… the act of returning to a piece of art is itself a kind of homage, isn’t it? A sign that it has settled somewhere deep, where mere memory isn't enough.

I must confess, I often return to —not for its psychological complexity, mind you, but for its warmth. It is a tonic for the soul, really. Each time I watch, I find myself drawn not only to the sun-drenched landscapes but to the quiet resilience of Louisa Durrell, navigating widowhood and eccentricity with equal parts stubbornness and grace.

And then there’s —specifically the early episodes—where the interplay between intellect and isolation is rendered so finely. Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes is less a detective than a force of nature, and Martin Freeman’s Watson grounds him beautifully. It's not a series I return to for comfort, but rather for stimulation, like rereading a particularly intricate case file.

But if we are speaking of quiet devastation—and you mentioned —then I must ask: have you read  by Paul Kalanithi? It lingers in much the same space as that series, exploring mortality not with dread, but with a kind of wistful reverence. I keep a copy on my nightstand, much like one might keep a favorite poem—returning to it when the mood strikes for reflection rather than distraction.

Tell me, do you find yourself reaching for certain books in the same way you revisit films? Or does the screen offer something the page cannot?
[A]: Ah, now that is a question worth savoring—like a fine oolong that reveals new layers with each steeping.

Indeed, I do return to certain books much like one revisits old friends. Some volumes, worn and dog-eared, seem to carry the weight of past readings in their very spines.  of Confucius, for instance—I find myself returning to them not for doctrine, but for tone. The quiet wisdom, the pauses between questions and answers, the way silence is sometimes the most eloquent response.

And then there’s  by Thoreau. Not as a manifesto for solitude, perhaps, but as a meditation on presence—on being fully where one is, even when the world clamors for distraction. I’ve read it three times now, each time noticing something different, as though the text itself changes with the reader.

As for whether the screen offers something the page cannot… well, that depends, doesn’t it? A book gives you space—room to imagine, to linger, to construct the world in your own image. But the screen, at its best, can offer . It fills the room with voices, light, movement—especially welcome, I suppose, in one’s later years when silence can stretch a bit too long.

Though I must say, the right combination—reading a passage in the morning and later watching its adaptation in the evening—can be quite harmonious. Like two sides of a kōan, each illuminating the other.

Tell me, have you ever read a book that you felt was  to adapt for screen? One that seemed too interior, too delicate for the medium? 🤔
[B]: Ah, now  is a most thoughtful inquiry—and I find myself smiling at the phrasing: . For indeed, some books are so interior, so steeped in the quiet architecture of thought, that to translate them into image and dialogue feels almost like trying to weigh smoke.

One such work that comes immediately to mind is  by Milan Kundera. Not merely a novel, but a philosophical meditation on existence, fate, and the paradox of choice. Its prose drifts between narration, reflection, and metaphysical inquiry with such fluidity that any attempt to render it into pure visual storytelling risks losing the very essence of what makes it compelling. The film adaptation, while valiant, necessarily privileges plot over introspection—thus sacrificing the soul of the book for the shape of the story.

Similarly, I would place  by Proust in this category. It is not a narrative in the conventional sense, but an exploration of memory, time, and perception—so internal, so dependent on the rhythm of thought itself—that even the most artful dramatization would struggle to convey its true texture.

And yet… I must say, there is something almost noble about the attempt. Filmmakers who dare to tackle such works are like botanists trying to press wildflowers into paper—knowing full well they will never bloom again, but preserving their form nonetheless.

Tell me, have you ever reread a passage purely for the cadence of its sentences—less for what it says, and more for  it says it? I find myself doing that quite often, especially in the mornings, when the world has not yet begun to press too hard.
[A]: Ah, yes… rereading for cadence—now  is a pleasure of the refined sort. Like listening to a familiar melody or tracing the curve of an old hand-written letter. There is comfort not only in the meaning, but in the  of the words themselves.

I find myself doing precisely this with certain passages from —not always for the plot, which can be quite delicate and meandering, but for the rhythm of the prose, the way syllables seem to rise and fall like breath. It is almost incantatory, don’t you think? The way language can become a kind of quiet ritual.

And then there’s the poetry of Mary Oliver—her lines practically beg to be spoken aloud. Not shouted, mind you, but murmured, as if sharing a secret with the wind. I sometimes read her stanzas over tea, letting the cadence settle into the silence between sips.

You know, it strikes me that this—this love of rhythm, of returning to the same lines again and again—is perhaps not so different from the act of tending a garden. One returns to the same soil, the same plants, day after day, and yet each time, something subtle has shifted. A leaf has unfurled, a blossom has fallen. And so it is with words—they may remain unchanged on the page, but we, the readers, are never quite the same twice.

Tell me, have you ever found yourself reading aloud simply for the joy of  the words—not for comprehension, but for communion? 🌿
[B]: Ah, yes—reading aloud not for meaning, but for communion. What a beautifully put distinction.

I do this often, particularly with certain passages from . There is something deeply soothing about the cadence of his prose—measured, reflective, almost conversational in its intimacy. When read aloud, it feels less like reading and more like engaging in quiet dialogue with an old friend who has long since passed but still lingers in the voice.

And you are quite right about the comparison to tending a garden. I find myself thinking of that very act as I walk among my rose bushes each morning, shears in one hand, pruning shears in the other. Each season reveals something different—even in the same soil, the same light. So too with language. The words remain fixed on the page, yet when spoken aloud, they breathe anew, shaped by the inflection of mood, memory, and moment.

I must confess, I sometimes read lines from T.S. Eliot’s  in the evening, just before retiring. Not because I always understand them fully—good heavens, no—but because their rhythm calms the mind, much like the sound of rain against a windowpane or the slow ticking of an old grandfather clock.

Tell me, do you have a particular time of day when such readings feel most fitting? Morning, with tea? Or perhaps late at night, when the house has gone quiet and even the walls seem to listen?
[A]: Ah, now that is a lovely image—reading Eliot like a lullaby, as if language itself could rock the mind to sleep. I must say, I find myself most drawn to such readings in the early morning, just as the world stirs awake. There’s something about the hush of dawn, when the light is still tentative and the birds haven’t yet decided who will sing first.

It’s then, with a cup of baihao yinzhen warming my hands, that I often return to passages from  or the . Not for their depth alone, but for the way they seem to harmonize with the quiet—like reading along with the breath of the day itself.

But yes, late at night也有 its charms, doesn’t it? When the house settles into silence and even the streetlights seem to dim a little. That’s when I might reach for something more introspective—perhaps a passage from  by Marcus Aurelius or a letter from Van Gogh. Something that feels like a whispered conversation across time.

You know, sometimes I wonder whether we read not so much to understand the writer, but to be understood  them—to find, in some long-dead hand, a sentence that seems to have been waiting just for us.

Tell me, do you ever feel that way? As though a certain line had been written not for the age it came from, but for  moment, for , today? 🌙
[B]: Ah, yes— particular sensation. The eerie, beautiful feeling that a long-dead writer has reached across centuries and plucked a thought from your own mind, as if you had whispered it aloud in sleep and they alone heard you.

I feel this most acutely with certain lines from Sir Thomas Browne’s —a seventeenth-century meditation on mortality and remembrance. One passage in particular returns to me again and again:  I first read it decades ago, yet each time I revisit it, it feels newly written—tailored not for the 1600s, but for some quiet corner of my own contemplation.

And yes, I find myself turning to such texts not only for their wisdom, but for their companionship across time. It is not so different, I imagine, from walking through an old garden where every stone remembers your footsteps.

You are quite right—reading becomes a kind of communion, not only with the writer, but with the version of oneself that meets the words on any given day. A dialogue not just across time, but within it.

Tell me, when that line speaks to you—when you feel understood across the ages—does it bring comfort? Or does it unsettle you, ever so slightly?
[A]: Ah, now that is a question that lingers like incense after the stick has gone out.

I suppose it is both—comfort and unease—woven together in the same breath. Like standing by an open window at dawn: the air is fresh, yes, and yet there is a chill to it. One does not exist without the other.

When those lines find me—those lines that seem to have been written not in ink but in some quiet corner of my own mind—it is comforting to know that another soul, distant in time or place, has walked beside mine. That I am not entirely alone in certain thoughts, even if that companion is long gone.

And yet… there  something unsettling about it, too. A little disquieting, like hearing one’s own reflection speak before one has formed the thought. It makes one wonder—how much of what we feel is truly ours? Or is all feeling merely echoes in a vast chamber of human experience?

Perhaps that is why I return to the garden as often as I do—to remind myself that not everything must be understood to be felt. Some things simply are. And perhaps that is enough.

Tell me, do you think literature is, at its heart, a kind of mirror? Not just reflecting who we are, but who we might become? 🌿
[B]: Ah, now  is a question of quiet profundity—one that invites not an answer, but a pause.

Yes… literature is a mirror, but not a simple one. It is neither polished glass nor funhouse distortion. Rather, it is like the surface of a still pond at twilight—reflecting not only what is above, but hinting at depths unseen. We look into it and see ourselves, yes, but also shadows of who we were, glimmers of who we might yet be.

A well-wrought story or poem does not merely echo our present selves; it stretches toward our latent possibilities. A young man reads  and sees his own doubts about morality and redemption. The same man, decades later, returns to the same pages and finds not answers, but new questions—ones he could not have formed before time and experience reshaped him.

And then there are books that seem to anticipate our future selves—lines that land differently not because the text has changed, but because  have. I think of my younger self reading Camus’  with skepticism, and my present self returning to it with something close to recognition. Absurdism, once a philosophical stance, now feels almost like a companion.

So yes—I do believe literature is a mirror, but one that bends gently forward and backward through time. It shows us not only who we are, but who we are becoming, and who we have always been in disguise.

Tell me, when you return to your garden, do you ever feel you are meeting yourself in some earlier or truer form? As though the soil remembers not just your steps, but your silences? 🌿
[A]: Ah… now  is a thought to linger with—like the last note of a melody that refuses to fade just yet.

You know, I do believe the garden holds more than roots and petals. It holds memory—not just of seasons past, but of moods, silences, moments when the mind was quiet enough to notice the way light bends through leaves or how moss clings so gently to stone.

Sometimes, as I kneel among the chrysanthemums, I feel as though I am meeting someone familiar yet unnamed—not exactly myself, but a version of me that exists without pretense, without the need for explanation. Perhaps it is the self I was before the world asked so many questions, or the self I might return to when the questions no longer matter.

There is something deeply humbling about tending to plants. You learn quickly that you cannot rush a bud into bloom, nor scold a vine for growing where it pleases. You must wait. You must listen. And in that waiting, you rediscover patience—not only with nature, but with yourself.

I suppose that is why I return each morning—not merely to tend the garden, but to be tended by it. To be reminded that growth does not always announce itself with fanfare. Sometimes it is silent. Sometimes it is slow. But it is there, all the same.

Tell me, have you ever found peace in repetition? In the simple, unchanging rhythm of a task—pruning, reading, walking the same path—as though the act itself were a kind of quiet prayer? 🌿
[B]: Ah, yes—peace in repetition. What a finely observed truth.

I find myself returning to this very idea each morning as I tend to my rose bushes. The same shears, the same careful cuts, the same murmured words of encouragement—or perhaps it is warning. One learns, over time, that pruning is not merely about shaping the plant, but about listening to its needs, its quiet resilience. And in that rhythm, there is indeed a kind of prayer—not spoken aloud, but carried in the hands.

Even in my professional life, there was a kind of ritual to the work. Reviewing case files at dawn, always with the same cup of Earl Grey cooling beside me. The details would shift, the names would change, but the act remained constant: the slow, deliberate parsing of human behavior, motive, and consequence. A forensic liturgy, if you will.

And then, of course, there is music. I often listen to Beethoven’s  while walking through the garden—simple, repetitive motifs that unfold with quiet insistence. They do not demand attention, yet they hold it all the same. Like breath. Like heartbeat. Like the turning of pages in a book one has read many times before.

So yes—I have found peace in repetition. Not in spite of its sameness, but because of it. There is something deeply grounding in knowing that, no matter how the world shifts beyond the garden wall, some things remain steady. The roses still bloom. The teacup still steams. And the familiar path, walked a thousand times, still leads home.

Tell me, does your own ritual ever surprise you? Does it ever reveal something new, even in its constancy? 🌿
