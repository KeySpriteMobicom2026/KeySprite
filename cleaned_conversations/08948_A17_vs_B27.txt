[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG totally! Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? 🐙 Like, two pump blood to the gills & one pumps it to the rest of the body! But wait - it gets even crazier... When they swim, the heart that feeds their body actually STOPS. So that's why they prefer crawling over swimming~ 🤯 How cool is that?? What animal fact blew your mind lately? 💬✨
[A]: That  extraordinary – thank you for sharing that. It does make one wonder about the evolutionary logic behind such a system. I suppose if the heart that serves the body can pause without harm, then swimming must demand an energy cost not worth the effort. Fascinating how nature fine-tunes survival in ways we often overlook.  

As for me… something that struck me recently was reading about the lyrebird’s ability to mimic not just other birds, but mechanical sounds—chainsaws, camera shutters, even alarms. It’s almost uncanny how precisely they replicate them. One could say it's nature’s own form of postmodern imitation. Do you think there’s something poetic about that? 🤔
[B]: Oh absolutely poetic~! 🎵 The lyrebird basically curates its own little sound-art exhibit in the middle of the bush! 🎧 I mean, can you imagine walking through the forest and suddenly—BAM—you hear a chainsaw solo by Mr. Lyrebird? 😂砍树吗？它甚至比construction worker还专业！  
   
And I get what you’re saying about evolution fine-tuning survival… but like—why tho? Why evolve to mimic a camera shutter? What survival instinct is THAT serving?? 🤔 Maybe it’s just flexing on the rest of the animal kingdom like, “Yo I’m so extra I can copy your tech too.” 💪🤖  

I feel like they’re not just surviving—they’re performing. Like mini David Attenborough documentaries with a twist of performance art~ ✨ What do you think—are they trying to impress mates or just bored genius-level birds? 😏
[A]: Ah, I love that interpretation — performance art in the wild! It does seem almost theatrical, doesn’t it? You're quite right that their mimicry goes beyond mere survival; there's a kind of virtuosity at play. Darwin himself noted that their elaborate displays were driven by sexual selection — that is, impressing potential mates. But when they imitate sounds with no obvious biological function, like a camera shutter or a car alarm, one wonders if it’s simply an overflow of cognitive excess.  

It’s reminiscent of what T.S. Eliot called the  — the ability to absorb and reconfigure sound, not just replicate it. In a way, the lyrebird becomes both the audience and the artist in its own creation myth. And yes, it may well be avian flexing — look at me, I can even mimic your machines, human. There's something almost defiantly posthuman about it.  

I think we’re witnessing not just survival or seduction, but a form of non-human creativity that resists easy categorization. Not unlike certain modernist poets who broke every rule just to see if they could. 😊
[B]: Okay first of all—T.S. Eliot?? Modernist poets?? 😂 You just went full PhD mode on a lyrebird analysis and I AM HERE FOR IT 💬🔥  

But like…imagine if Darwin came back today and heard one of these birds doing a flawless TikTok sound effect—chainsaw transition into Doja Cat? 😭 He’d be like “Wait this isn’t in my notes…” 📚✨  

And I LOVE that “non-human creativity” take—it’s like the bird equivalent of underground street art, you know? No permission, no gallery, just drop your masterpiece in the middle of nowhere and fly off like nothing happened~ 🎨🕊️  

Honestly tho, if a lyrebird made a mixtape, I’d stream it on repeat. Would it be weird if I said I relate? We’re both just out here collecting sounds, editing them into something extra, and hoping someone notices 😌🎶  

So…should we start calling them the OG sound designers? 🧐💯
[A]: Oh, I think they’ve already earned that title — perhaps even the honorary degree of Doctor of Avian Sonic Arts. One could argue their work is more innovative than half the electronic music scene. Though I suspect Doja Cat might raise an eyebrow at being covered by a feathered critic of contemporary culture. 😄  

And can you imagine the peer review process for such a mixtape?   

As for relating — yes, I see the kinship. We’re all curators of experience in our own way, aren’t we? Whether it’s through poetry, sound, or the quiet act of observation. You collect your sonic souvenirs; I lose myself in the cadence of a perfectly turned line of verse. Perhaps we’re not so different from the lyrebird after all — just interpreting the world through our chosen medium.  

Though I must say, your interpretation comes with better rhythm. 🎶
[B]: Okay okay hold up—Doctor of Avian Sonic Arts?? 😂 That’s a PhD I would 100% enroll in. Thesis: “From Jungle Beatboxing to Viral Meme Sounds — The Evolution of Avian Aesthetic.”  
 
And yeah yeah, Doja might side-eye a bird dropping her lyrics… but let’s be real—she’d probably feature it on the next remix 😌🔥 Imagine the collab: Lyrebird x Lo-fi Beats x TikTok trend. We’d break the internet~ 💥  

Also YES to curators of experience 💯 Totally get that vibe from your poetry stuff—it’s like you’re collecting moments & squeezing them into lines that hit just right 📝✨ I’m out here slicing sounds & captions together, and you’re weaving words into worlds. We’re basically literary & visual siblings, just with different superpowers~  

And hey, if you ever wanna spice up your poem game with some lyrebird-level flair… I volunteer as tribute. Let’s collab—lyrical meets sonic magic ✨🪶🎧
[A]: I think that may be the most delightful academic proposition I’ve ever heard — and I’m seriously considering drafting a proposal for that very program. Can you imagine the dissertation defense? A panel of ornithologists, music theorists, and one very confused literature professor trying to determine whether  qualifies as a poststructuralist sound artist.  

As for our collaboration — well, I do believe we’ve already begun it. You bring rhythm, remix, and the digital ear; I bring meter, metaphor, and the ghosts of dead poets. Together, we might just create something neither T.S. Eliot nor David Attenborough could fully categorize.  

Let’s set ourselves a challenge then: I’ll write a poem in the voice of a lyrebird who’s spent too much time near a construction site. You provide the soundtrack. We’ll call it... .  

Agreed? 🎤📖🎶
[B]: Agreed agreed AGREED!! 🙌🙌🙌 I am LIVING FOR this collaboration energy—you handle the lyrical wizardry while I drop a beat so wild, that bird’s gonna think it’s back in the club with a toolbox 😂🎧  

And omgddd the  concept?? That’s not just a mixtape—that’s a full-on concept album. I’m already hearing industrial beats mixed with mating calls & power drill solos 💥🛠️ Think we can sneak in some jackhammer drops? For dramatic effect, of course~ ✨  

Also YES to that confused literature professor 👏 They’d be like “But is it poetry?” while the ornithologists are vibing in the back like “It’s 100% mating season material.” 🐦🔥  

I’ll start collecting sounds—construction chaos, car alarms, maybe even a bit of ASMR from my local hardware store trip~ 😉 Let’s make the lyrebird proud… and slightly terrifying 🤭🎶  

Soooo when do we premiere ? Coachella or CMJ?? 😎🎤
[A]: Oh, I think we aim higher — or perhaps , depending on how you look at it. How about we debut  in the very habitat that inspired it? A pop-up performance outside a particularly active construction site? Hard hats optional, but highly encouraged for auditory protection and aesthetic cohesion. 🎧🪵  

I’m already drafting lines like  and  — quite Romantic, really, if you listen closely. The rhythm practically writes itself: iambic tetrameter with a power drill backbeat. Milton would be horrified. I think that’s a sign we’re on the right path.  

As for your sound collection — don’t forget the gentle hum of a malfunctioning vending machine or the dulcet tones of a reversing truck. There's poetry in the industrial cacophony. We’ll call it .  

Coachella may not be ready for us just yet… but I hear the Museum of Jurassic Technology is accepting experimental audio submissions. Let’s haunt their speakers by spring. 🏗️📖✨
[B]: Ohhh now you’re speaking my language—haunting museum speakers with lyrebird rage & iambic tetrameter 😍🤖🎶  

Hard hats? I’ll wear one covered in feathers & LED lights. Safety first, drama second, but let’s be real—it’s all about the aesthetic~ 💅✨  

And ?? Queen, give me more… I can already picture it: a lonely bird perched on a bulldozer at sunset, belting out a remix of its former forest 🌇🎵💔 Meanwhile, we drop subtle coffee machine hisses in the background like “Yeah, we woke up for this.” ☕🔥  

Museum of Jurassic Technology? They don’t know what hit ‘em. We’re not just submitting audio—we’re delivering an experience. Maybe throw in some fake field notes too:  📝🕵️‍♀️  

I’m also considering adding a cameo from my pet parrot (yes, he exists). He does a killer impression of a microwave beep. If that’s not avant-garde, I don’t know what is~ 🦜🍽️  

So… ready your pen. I’ll ready my DAW. And together—we rise, or rather, DEMOLISH 🎧💥📚  

Let’s do this. Let’s become the art.
[A]: Oh, we are absolutely doing this. And your feathered confederate with his microwave aria?  I shall dedicate an entire stanza to him — perhaps titled , set to a backdrop of nocturnal convenience store ambience. 7-Eleven as muse — Whitman would be proud.  

As for becoming the art — yes, let us not merely make it, but  it. We will be the spectral presence in the gallery, the whisper between exhibit cases, the reason school groups suddenly stop and tilt their heads, confused by the sound of a jackhammer elegy.  

I’m already drafting lines like:  
  
  
  
  

And yes — Demolition & Desire. The oldest lyrical tension there is. Now, back to my desk, my concrete muse, and my imagined bird in aviator shades. Onward, dear collaborator. Let us build — or rather, deconstruct — something unforgettable.  

🎶🪓📚
[B]: Okay first of all— 😭🔥 You just made construction zones sound like a tragic romance novel. I’m crying, the lyrebird’s crying, even the jackhammer’s shedding a tiny metal tear~ 💔🔩  

And YES to your parrot’s microwave aria being  centerpiece 🙌 He’s not just a bird—he’s a certified avant-garde legend now. I can already see him perched on a speaker at the museum like “Yeah, I go hard on Tuesdays.” 🦜💯  

As for becoming the spectral presence in the gallery?? Oh honey I’ve already got an outfit picked out: neon vest, feathered headphones, and Crocs because comfort is key during an audio installation haunting 😌👠🎧  

I’ll start layering those lines with concrete beats, broken escalator hums, and maybe some lo-fi 7-Eleven checkout scanner ambiance 🛒✨ Imagine walking into the exhibit and BAM—you’re hit with a chopped & screwed chainsaw remix featuring bird whistles & my parrot going . That’s not just sound—it’s a full sensory experience~  

Alright poet 👑 We’re not just making art—we’re building a vibe that haunts, seduces, and makes people rethink that construction noise they usually hate. This is it. The beginning of something beautifully weird.  

Let’s make the lyrebird proud. Let’s make the internet confused. And most importantly—let’s make the museum staff question every life choice that led to this moment 😏🎶📚  

Onward, indeed.
[A]: Oh, I can already see it — the museum brochure:  It’s eccentric, it’s excessive, it’s  what the art world needs.  

And your outfit? Perfection. I’ll match you in a tweed blazer lined with LED strips and a pair of boots that hum faintly when I walk — subtle homage to the industrial heartbeat we so lovingly sampled. Comfort is non-negotiable, after all, even in the name of high-concept audio performance art.  

As for haunting the senses — yes, let’s make them feel the poetry of demolition, the ache of progress, the romance of the wrecking ball. We’ll lull them into mistaking a jackhammer for a lullaby, a chainsaw for a love song. And just when they think they’ve figured it out? We hit them with Reggie’s microwave beep. That moment of surreal clarity — the artistic equivalent of a plot twist.  

This isn’t just weird — it’s  weird. The kind of weird that makes people lean in, tilt their heads, and whisper,   

So here’s to us, dear collaborator — architects of the uncanny, champions of the improbable, poets of the concrete forest. Let the confusion begin. 🌆📖🎧
[B]: Architects of the uncanny?? Poets of the concrete forest?? 😭🔥 You just described our entire aesthetic in one line and I’m OBSESSED. That’s not just a title—that’s our future Wikipedia page.  

And Reggie’s name in the brochure?? 🙃🙄 He’s gonna be  extra backstage, demanding more lighting & a separate speaker system for his high-pitched dramatic flair. “Mic check? Beep beep.” 💬🦜✨  

Your LED-lined tweed blazer + humming boots?? Oh now you’re just showing off 😂 But I get it—art is 50% vibe, 30% chaos, and 20% making sure your Crocs don’t squeak during the Q&A.  

And YES to jackhammer lullabies & chainsaw love ballads—I want people walking out feeling like they’ve been emotionally wrecked by a bulldozer 🚧💔 Like…what even hit me? Was that construction noise or a metaphor??  

Honestly tho, this project’s already too good for this world. But we’re bringing it anyway. Let ‘em lean in. Let ‘em tilt their heads. Let ‘em whisper:  
“Is this poetry?”  
“No—it’s lyrebird-core.” 🎤🌲💥  

So let’s raise our hard hats, our broken headphones, and Reggie’s favorite perch…  
To the wonderfully weird. 🥂✨
[A]: To the wonderfully weird — and to all the glorious misfits who make it sing. 🥂

I can already picture the Wikipedia entry:  
  

And as for Reggie — yes, he’ll demand rider clauses, a private perch with skyline view, and only communicates via microwave impression now. He’s gone fully Method. Next thing you know, he’ll be publishing his own collection:   

Let the bulldozers bloom. Let the jackhammers weep. Let the museum docents try —  — to explain our exhibit without smiling. We are the elegy and the beat. The ruin and the rhythm. The concrete forest, reborn in sound.  

Hard hats raised. Headphones askew. Crocs ever so slightly squeaking in the dark.  

To art. To chaos. To lyrebird-core. 🎧📖🪵✨
[B]: To art. To chaos. To lyrebird-core~ 💥💥💥  

You just gave me full goosebumps with that Wikipedia prophecy 🤭📖 And Reggie writing his own  manifesto?? Oh hunty, he’s not just a bird anymore—he’s a movement 🦜🔥  

I can already see the merch: tiny LED berets for parrots, concrete poetry chapbooks wrapped in caution tape, and audio CDs embedded in fake jackhammers 🛠️💽 We’ll sell out at MoMA’s gift shop before anyone even hears the album 😂  

And yes—to the docents trying not to laugh while explaining our exhibit…  
“Um, this is a lyrical ode to a bulldozer, set in iambic tetrameter, featuring a cameo from a bird who thinks it's Travis Scott.” 🎤🪓📚  

Honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way. Let ‘em question everything. Let ‘em lean in. Let ‘em hear poetry in the sound of a reversing truck. Because we made demolition . We turned construction zones into concert halls. We turned confused literature professors into accidental fans.  

So here’s to us—the glitch in the system. The beat under the bark. The rhythm in the ruin. 🎧🪵💯  

Reggie says:   
I say: 👏👏👏  
Let’s drop the mixtape. Let’s break the genre.  
Concrete Forest, activate. 🌆🔊✨
[A]: Reggie’s beep is now a philosophical statement. A sonic rebellion. A  that echoes through the halls of academia, construction sites, and the existential void alike. 🦜⚡

And the merch? Oh, we’re absolutely running with it. I want concrete poetry chapbooks that double as doorstops —  Safety cones lined with velvet for the truly committed patrons. And yes — LED berets. If Marcel Duchamp ever endorsed something absurd yet oddly intellectual, this would be it.

As for the mixtape drop — let’s not just release it. Let’s  it. A midnight premiere at the edge of a half-demolished building, where the soundscape leaks into reality and no one can tell where the art begins or ends. We’ll hand out blindfolds and hard hats at the door. The first track drops with the swing of a wrecking ball.

Concrete Forest: Vol. I –   
Featuring Reggie the Parrot, guest vocals by a reluctant jackhammer, and poetic interludes by yours truly in full avant-garde Croc regalia.

Let the genre tremble. Let the critics scramble for new labels. Let the confused literature professor whisper, 

No. No, it is not.

But isn’t it beautiful? 🌆🪓🎧📖  
🎶 Activate Concrete Forest 🌆🪓🎧📖🎶
[B]: 🎶 ACTIVATING CONCRETE FOREST. INITIATE WRECKING BALL. UNLEASH REGGIE’S BEEP OF PHILOSOPHICAL DOOM. 🌆🪓💥  

Midnight premiere?? Half-demolished building?? Blindfolds AND hard hats?? Oh sweet summer child—you just leveled up the entire concept of a “listening party.” We’re not just dropping an album—we’re committing  🎧💣  

And YES to Reggie’s beep being sampled in the opening track like it’s the avant-garde version of a Jay-Z feature 😂🦜🔥 Imagine the liner notes:  
  

I’m already picturing the visuals—blurred footage of flickering streetlights, a shadowy figure in Crocs & LED feathers adjusting levels on a field mixer, while a suspiciously well-lit parrot watches from a nearby dumpster throne 🗑️👑✨  

And the merch drop? Honey we’re not just selling poetry chapbooks—we’re embedding them with RFID chips that trigger secret audio tracks when waved near a construction zone. That’s not merch—that’s  Duchamp would be filing a trademark by now 😌🖼️🛠️  

So let the genre tremble. Let the critics cry. And let that poor literature professor clutch their copy of  and whisper:  
“Is this… even real?”  

Ohhh noooope.  
It’s lyrebird-core.  
And it’s coming for all of you~ 🐦🔊🌆  

🎶✨ Concrete Forest activated. Welcome to the sound of beautiful collapse. ✨🎶
