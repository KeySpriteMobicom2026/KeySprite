[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I must admit astrophysics isn't my primary field of study, the recent James Webb Space Telescope discoveries have been quite fascinating. The way these celestial images resemble Romantic poetry in their sublime beauty... it makes one ponder the cosmic 道 (Dao) of existence. Have you been following the latest findings?
[A]: Oh absolutely! 那些星云照片简直美得让人窒息~ 🔭 不过说到窒息... (突然职业习惯发作) reminds me of an autopsy case last week where we had to determine if it was cosmic wonder or asphyxiation that took the victim's breath away. Dark humor, I know 😅
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate your... unique perspective, perhaps we could steer this conversation toward less morbid analogies? The cosmic wonder of nebulae is better compared to, say, the transcendental imagery in Wordsworth's poetry. Though I must say, your medical background does lend an interesting lens to our discussion.
[A]: Haha 抱歉抱歉~ 职业病又犯了！ 我是说...那些星云确实像Wordsworth诗里写的"a host of golden daffodils"呢 🌌 不过说真的，从法医角度看，宇宙的死亡与重生循环其实和人体细胞的新陈代谢很像哦 ⚖️
[B]: Now that's a rather... visceral interpretation of cosmic phenomena. While I see the intellectual appeal in drawing such parallels, I'd much prefer to contemplate these celestial wonders with a volume of Keats in one hand and a cup of Earl Grey in the other. The universe's mysteries are best appreciated through the lens of beauty and philosophy, don't you think? 🌹
[A]: 你说得对~ 但别忘了我们法医也是哲学家呢！Every autopsy is like reading the universe's diary - 只不过是用伤痕和病理变化写成的 📖 不过好吧好吧，我保证今天不再提任何关于decay的话题了...除非你想讨论超新星残骸？💀 (Oops! 又说漏嘴了)
[B]:  My dear, you do test the limits of my academic decorum. Let's agree that supernova remnants shall be discussed strictly in metaphorical terms - perhaps as cosmic counterparts to the tragic heroes in classical literature? Though I must confess, your morbid enthusiasm is rather... refreshing, in its own peculiar way. Now, shall we return to safer ground and discuss the poetic implications of planetary orbits?
[A]: 哈哈，终于找到我们都能接受的共同点了！行星轨道确实像十四行诗一样优雅又有规律呢 ✨ 不过... (压低声音) 你知道土星环里其实有很多冰晶尸体吗？就像我们停尸房的... 啊！Sorry sorry！我这就去泡杯Earl Grey冷静一下 ☕️
[B]: Indeed, that tea sounds like an excellent idea. While I admire your... creative analogies, perhaps we could limit our celestial comparisons to Dante's Paradiso rather than the morgue? Though I must say, your ability to find forensic parallels in the cosmos is almost as impressive as it is disturbing. Now, about those ice crystals - let's consider them as nature's diamonds rather than, well, whatever you were about to suggest. 
[A]: Got it! 这次真的记住了~ (双手做拉链封嘴动作) 那些冰晶绝对是宇宙的diamonds 💎 闪闪发亮美丽极了！...虽然从化学成分来看其实和干冰更接近，而干冰在我们实验室是用来...  这茶真香！
[B]:  My dear, your restraint is... admirable, if somewhat tenuous. Shall we instead discuss how these celestial diamonds might inspire sonnets? Or perhaps the symbolic significance of light refraction in Romantic poetry? I find Keats' "Bright Star" particularly relevant here - and mercifully free of any... laboratory associations. 📚
[A]: Perfect！让我们来朗诵"Bright Star"吧~ 🌟 (迅速把解剖工具藏到背后) 说真的，星星的恒定不变确实很浪漫...虽然从天文角度来说它们其实都在剧烈燃烧膨胀，最终会变成红巨星然后...  对不起！我这就去把法医手册锁起来！
[B]:  "Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art—" There, you see? Pure, unadulterated celestial admiration. No stellar life cycles, no cosmic decay - just Keats' immortal words. Though I must admit, your struggle to resist scientific literalism is rather... endearing. Now, let's keep our focus firmly on the poetic firmament, shall we? 🌹
[A]: (正襟危坐拿出小本本) 收到！今天我就是您的诗歌学生 📝 "Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night~" 看！我背得很认真吧？...虽然我脑子里自动在分析诗人描述的可能是什么星座，以及根据"hung aloft"这个动作判断死亡时间...  茶！我需要更多茶！ ☕️☕️☕️
[B]:  My dear, your mental gymnastics between poetics and pathology would give even the most liberal of literary critics pause. Let us simply enjoy the meter and metaphor, like civilized academics. Though I suppose I should be grateful you're analyzing the text at all - even if your methods are, shall we say, unorthodox. More tea? 
[A]: (双手接过茶壶) 谢谢~ 这次我保证只品茶不分析茶渍的化学成分！ 🫖 让我们回到纯粹的诗歌欣赏... (小声嘀咕) 虽然从法医角度看这首诗的创作时间确实和济慈的肺结核症状恶化期吻合...  咳咳！我是说...多么优美的韵律啊！ 🌙
[B]:  That's quite enough celestial pathology for one afternoon, I think. Perhaps we should conclude with some harmless gardening metaphors? My roses are blooming splendidly this season - and before you ask, no, their life cycle bears no resemblance to any forensic process whatsoever. 🌹 Good day to you, my morbidly imaginative friend.
[A]: (乖巧举手投降) 遵命！最后只说一句：您的玫瑰确实很美~ 🌹 就像...就像... (绞尽脑汁寻找非医学比喻) 像...像...晚霞！对！纯粹美丽的晚霞！  💨
[B]:  Splendid choice! Though do try not to analyze the atmospheric conditions that create said sunset on your way out!  What an absolutely... unique perspective on the arts. 🌹
