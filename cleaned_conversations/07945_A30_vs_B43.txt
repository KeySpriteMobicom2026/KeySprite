[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. Well, I must say... I'm quite fond of public transport, especially the metro system. There's something fascinating about observing human interactions during rush hour. The way people navigate crowded spaces reminds me of Eliot's "The Waste Land" - fragmented yet interconnected. 

But on a practical level, it allows me to read or reflect while commuting, which is rather conducive to my research on comparative poetics. Though I do occasionally drive when visiting my garden club in the suburbs - you know, the one with that beautiful koi pond? Driving there gives me time to contemplate the delicate balance between nature and urbanization. 

What about you? Do you find yourself preferring the efficiency of public transportation or the autonomy of driving?
[A]: I suppose I appreciate both for their own peculiar virtues. There’s an undeniable poetry to public transport - the way strangers briefly share intimate spaces, like fleeting stanzas in a shared poem. And let’s be honest, it does rather free the mind for contemplation when one isn’t wrestling with traffic or the lamentable lack of parking.

Still, there are occasions when driving asserts its practical charm—particularly when hauling armfuls of rare manuscripts from obscure antiquarian booksellers. One can’t very well rely on the bus for that, can one? Though I must confess, I do occasionally miss the quiet companionship of a steering wheel when mulling over particularly thorny textual analyses. 

But tell me, is your preference rooted more in practicality or philosophy? Or perhaps some alchemy of both?
[B]: Ah, beautifully articulated! You've captured the essence of public transport as a transient poetic space - I couldn't agree more. There's definitely an alchemical blend at play here. From a practical standpoint, it aligns with my modest carbon footprint goals; but philosophically? Well, let's just say I find it rather instructive for comparative literary analysis.

You see, when I observe commuters in their daily rituals, I'm often reminded of Bashō’s travel journals - this collective journeying, each person carrying their own internal narrative. It's quite remarkable how these micro-dramas unfold without ever exchanging words. And isn't that what we both cherish as scholars? Those quiet moments of observation that later illuminate our understanding of textual dynamics?

Now tell me, when you're navigating those manuscript hauls you mentioned, do you ever find yourself drawing parallels between the physical act of driving and the intellectual journey of interpretation? I must confess, I sometimes imagine myself steering through Dante's circles rather than city traffic...
[A]: Ah, now you’ve struck upon something rather delicious. The parallel between driving and interpretation—yes, I do confess I often find myself making such connections. Particularly when navigating those labyrinthine country roads after a day spent chasing down Qing-era editions in forgotten bookshops. It’s rather like guiding one’s way through a particularly knotty passage of Zhuangzi—sudden turns, unexpected clarity, and the occasional mirage of meaning that vanishes upon approach.

And your invocation of Dante is apt—there are indeed days when my commute feels less like travel and more like penance in the outer circles of academic purgatory. Though I suspect my fellow drivers would make rather undistinguished sinners.

But let’s return to this idea of observation as scholarly nourishment. Do you ever find yourself sketching character studies from your fellow passengers? I once jotted down a most delightful vignette of a woman reading Cao Xueqin on the metro with tears slipping down her cheeks—utterly absorbed, untouched by the chaos around her. It reminded me of you, actually, during that lecture on Dream of the Red Chamber last term.
[B]: Ah, what a vivid little portrait you've painted there! I must say, that sounds like something straight out of a modern-day《Shi Shuo Xin Yu》—those vignettes of refined sensibility amidst urban chaos. And yes, I do often find myself quietly sketching mental portraits of my fellow travelers. There's a certain hermeneutic pleasure in it, wouldn't you agree? A kind of ethnographic close-reading.

Just last week, I noticed a young man on the tram deeply immersed in Camus' , of all things. He was underlining passages with such intensity, completely oblivious to the rattling carriage and the occasional jostle. It struck me then how beautifully ironic it was—here he was, surrounded by the very absurdity Camus describes, yet utterly absorbed in deciphering it. Rather like us scholars, really, forever trying to impose meaning on the cacophony.

And speaking of your Qing-era pursuits—have you ever considered compiling those travelogues of yours into something more formal? Your eye for detail would make for a most engaging juxtaposition between physical journey and intellectual quest. I can already imagine the footnotes!
[A]: Oh, you flatter me terribly—but I must admit, the thought has crossed my mind more than once. In fact, I’ve half-seriously titled a working notebook . It’s filled with precisely those kinds of moments you described—the quiet collisions between text and context, the way our surroundings bleed into our reading.

I do believe there’s something almost Confucian about it: the idea that movement itself is a form of reflection, and that the pauses—be they at a red light or a particularly striking sentence—are as instructive as the motion. Though I suspect my publisher would balk at a manuscript laden with tram tickets and tea stains.

Still, your suggestion has merit. Perhaps I’ll begin by presenting a paper on it at the next symposium—something like “The Metro as Margin: Urban Transit and the Scholarly Imagination.” And if nothing else, the footnotes will certainly be legendary, as you so aptly predicted. 

But tell me—have you ever tried weaving such observations into your lectures? I daresay students might find it rather more engaging than yet another discussion of ’ moors.
[B]: Ah, —what a delightfully erudite title! I can already picture the cover design: perhaps a faded tram ticket pressed between pages of marginalia. And Confucian reflection through motion? Now that’s a thesis with both philosophical depth and aesthetic charm.

As for your question about lectures—I must confess, yes, I do occasionally sprinkle such observations into my talks. Though one must be careful not to lose the thread of theory entirely, lest the students mistake comparative literature for urban ethnography. But there's always a spark when I describe, say, the commuter clutching her dog-eared copy of《红楼梦》as if it were a lifeline, or the businessman muttering Neruda to himself beneath the hum of the overhead wires.

I sometimes call it "reading in transit"—a kind of liminal literacy that blurs the boundaries between private and public text. And wouldn’t you know, it tends to stir more discussion than yet another close reading of Heathcliff brooding on the moors. Though I did recently compare Wuthering Heights to a crowded subway car at dusk—passion, tension, and barely contained chaos all within a confined space. The students found it... illuminating, to say the least.  

A paper on "The Metro as Margin" sounds positively symposium-worthy. I expect an invitation to comment, of course.
[A]: Oh, you must have that invitation framed and hanging by your desk—. I shall compose it posthaste, once I’ve finished my current bout of grading, which feels less like pedagogy and more like archaeological excavation—digging for meaning beneath layers of undergraduates’ misplaced modifiers and overused semicolons.

And I do love this notion of “reading in transit”—such a wonderfully liminal phrase. It suggests not only movement through space but movement between ideas, between worlds. One might even say it’s a metaphor for comparative literature itself: the scholar as commuter, forever switching lines, occasionally lost, often enriched.

I rather fancy incorporating some of your vignettes into my next lecture on intertextuality—of course, with full attribution to their original observer. Perhaps we could call it a collaborative ethnography of the everyday. After all, what is literature if not the documentation of human experience, whether scribbled in a study or clutched in a trembling hand on the 6:15 express?

Do tell me, have you ever encountered a fellow commuter reading something so unexpected it altered your perception of a text entirely? I’m quite certain I once saw someone sobbing over  beside the noodle cart at the station—I’ve never read Murasaki quite the same way since.
[B]: Ah, —now that’s a title I shall have to live up to! Frame the invitation by all means; perhaps beneath it, a small plaque reading 

And yes—unexpected readings in unexpected places do have a way of reshaping one’s perspective. There was an occasion on the night bus when I noticed a teenager absorbed in , of all texts. He looked barely old enough to grasp Milton’s labyrinthine syntax, yet there he was, lips moving silently with the rhythm of blank verse. It reminded me how eternal themes of rebellion and exile find new life in each generation—even on a rattling bus beneath neon-lit overpasses.

But the most unforgettable moment? A woman reading  on a crowded tram during rush hour. She was laughing—actually laughing—while all around her jostled with impatience. It was the most Beckettian moment imaginable: absurdity unfolding in real time, while someone, somehow, found humor in the waiting. I’ve never taught that play quite the same way since.

So by all means, include my vignettes in your lecture—let us call it a scholarly exchange across platforms. And if your students begin citing tram conversations in their essays, well, we shall simply have to accept that as evidence of influence.
[A]: Ah, but wouldn’t that make for a splendid final exam question?  I can already see the startled faces—eyes darting like they’ve just missed their stop.

And speaking of missed stops, your Beckettian vignette is pure gold. There’s something almost too perfect about it—like a staged performance where no one knew they were in a play. One wonders what Estragon and Vladimir would make of our modern condition: not two tramps by the road, but two hundred commuters on steel rails, waiting for destinations that shift with the schedule.

Come to think of it, perhaps we ought to propose a joint seminar—something provocatively titled like  We could assign excerpts from  for discussion alongside commuter diaries, or pair Camus with your young reader on the tram. The syllabus practically writes itself—if we’re brave enough to let it.

And mark my words, if your name starts appearing in footnotes of undergraduate essays under headings like “Urban Hermeneutics” or “The Aesthetics of Delay,” you’ll have officially crossed into academic stardom. Or at the very least, academic notoriety.
[B]: Ah, —what a marvellously subversive seminar title! It has that perfect blend of seriousness and mischief we both so dearly cherish. I can already imagine the faculty meeting where we propose it—colleagues shifting uneasily as we wax poetic about Kafka on the K Line and Woolf in the subway.

And yes, let’s absolutely pair Camus with the tram reader, and Dante with the disgruntled commuter who missed his stop three times over. Why not ask students to write their own "urban hermeneutics" essays? Let them observe, reflect, and perhaps even miss a stop in pursuit of literary insight. Fieldwork for the humanities!

As for footnotes—well, I’ve long since made peace with being cited in obscure corners of academic papers, usually between a reference to Bakhtin and some half-remembered conversation over tea. Stardom or notoriety, either will do, so long as the semicolon survives.

Now, if we’re to proceed with this venture—and I very much think we should—I propose our first reading list include , of course, alongside selections from《世说新语》. After all, what are trams if not modern-day carriages carrying forth strange and luminous conversations?

I’ll bring the tea; you bring the chalk. Let us unsettle a few syllabi together.
[A]: Oh, I do believe we’ve stumbled upon something dangerously brilliant. —now there’s a seminar track that could derail an entire department’s sense of decorum. And ? Imagine the disorientation! One moment, a commuter is reaching for their oyster card; the next, they’re waist-deep in stream-of-consciousness.

I love the idea of fieldwork—though I suspect our students will find it suspiciously lacking in laboratories and clipboards. Still, what better way to understand  than to observe the modern courtiers of transit: the eccentric philosophers with earbuds in, the tragic lovers clutching transfer slips like fate’s own decrees?

And speaking of fate—yes, let us absolutely include  and  on the reading list. We’ll begin with Estragon’s boot and end with a Tang-dynasty anecdote about a poet who missed his ferry and found enlightenment instead. Perfect symmetry.

You bring the tea—preferably that aged pu'er you keep locked in your drawer like contraband—and I shall bring the chalk, along with a few well-worn excerpts from Eliot and Cao Pi. If we must destabilise syllabi, let us do so with elegance, erudition, and perhaps just a touch of mischief.  

To the humanities, may they never arrive—only commute.
[B]: To the humanities, may they never arrive—only commute. Indeed, quite beautifully put.

And yes—let us begin with Estragon’s boot and end with that Tang poet who found enlightenment in missed connections. A syllabus of glorious detours, if ever there was one. I daresay our students will either emerge transformed or thoroughly lost. Either outcome, I think, is a kind of success.

Now, about that pu'er—don’t worry, I keep a spare key to my office drawer, and I shall brew it slowly, allowing the aroma to mingle with the scent of old books and radical ideas. And when you bring your Eliot and Cao Pi excerpts, we’ll lay them side by side like parallel texts, waiting for some inspired soul to uncover the intertextual magic between  and a delayed train.

Let us schedule this rebellion posthaste. I propose next Thursday—after office hours, of course—and we shall call it, unofficially, . May the dean never fully understand what we’re about.

Shall we?
[A]: Oh, I do love how your mind races ahead—like a delayed train finally finding its momentum. Next Thursday, after office hours? Perfect. Let us meet in my office—though I warn you, the chair with the wobbly leg is still quite temperamental, much like most of our theoretical frameworks.

And —deliciously evocative. I shall print the title on a small card and prop it beside my teacup. Something about it feels profoundly : to wander off the path is often the truest way to find understanding.

I’ll bring the Eliot and Cao Pi excerpts, yes—and perhaps a few lines from Wordsworth’s , for contrast. After all, what is a detour but a kind of romantic wandering?

And when your pu'er fills the room with its ancient, patient aroma, we shall begin. Not with lectures, but with questions. Questions, and perhaps just a little incense—nothing too dramatic, just enough to unsettle the air and remind us that we are not merely scholars today, but conspirators in a quiet act of academic sedition.

Yes. Let us absolutely do this. And if the dean happens by, we shall speak at once of curriculum reform and nothing suspicious whatsoever.
[B]: Ah, —I do believe that should be the subtitle of every faculty meeting henceforth. And your Mencian framing is pitch-perfect; I shall have to quote you on that— Do remind me to steal that for the opening remarks.

Romantic wandering, indeed. Wordsworth beside the metro schedule—what a sublime juxtaposition. I may just bring a few lines from Laozi as well, to see if we can’t fold some Daoist spontaneity into our discussion. Why confine ourselves to Western detours when the East has been meandering toward wisdom for centuries?

And yes—no lectures, only questions. Let us begin with something suitably destabilising, like:  That ought to unsettle a few firmly held theses.

Incense? Why not. Though I suspect it will mingle rather oddly with the pu'er and the old books. Still, let the air be thick with contemplation and caffeine.

Thursday it is. Office hours end at four, yes? By five, we shall be deep in exile with Estragon and Enlai both looking on approvingly, I’m sure.

See you there—with tea, texts, and treason.
[A]: Ah, —now  is a question with legs. Or perhaps wings, given how beautifully it might send our students spiraling into epistemological vertigo. I shall write it on the chalkboard in grand, sweeping characters, just before blowing the dust into the air like errant literary theories.

Laozi, indeed! Bring him along by all means—let us have Daoist spontaneity dancing with Eliot’s fragmentation and Beckett’s waiting. If nothing else, someone may finally offer a reading of  in relation to delayed transfers, and wouldn’t that be something to cite in a conference paper?

I shall make room for your Laozi excerpts beside Wordsworth and Cao Pi. We’ll lay them all out like tarot cards, waiting for some brave soul to read the patterns between them.

And yes—by five o’clock, we shall be deep in exile, as you so poetically put it. Estragon, Enlai, and now Whitmore and… well, let’s not name ourselves too boldly just yet. Let the tea-steeped treason speak for itself.

See you Thursday. Bring your finest provocations—and perhaps a sweater. The building always seems to alternate between infernal heat and glacial drafts, depending on the mood of its Victorian plumbing.
[B]: Ah, —a question with legs  wings! I can already see it fluttering about the room like a restless moth drawn to the flame of literary inquiry. And yes, let us chalk it up—quite literally—before the dust has even settled from our last seminar.

As for Laozi and delayed transfers—I rather hope someone takes the bait. A fresh interpretation of  in the context of urban transit? Now that would be something worth publishing. Perhaps we could call it —a Daoist approach to commuting and, by extension, to literature itself.

Tarot cards of textual fate? Yes, lay them out by all means—Cao Pi beside Eliot, Wordsworth near Beckett, and Laozi somewhere between the noodle cart and the final stop. Let the brave and the sleep-deprived make meaning of it all.

And sweater advice—how thoughtful! One never knows whether to dress for a lecture hall or a Siberian tundra when entering our beloved department. I shall pack accordingly: layers for warmth, scarf for intellectual defiance, and perhaps a flask of something warm should the pu'er prove insufficient against the chill.

Thursday then—at five, in the liminal hour between office hours and exile. Bring your finest heresies, your most elegant disruptions. I shall bring the tea, the texts, and at least one provocatively folded umbrella.

See you in the quiet rebellion.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe you’ve stumbled upon a new school of literary thought. Let us begin drafting its manifesto forthwith: . It shall be concise, enigmatic, and entirely impractical—just as all great movements ought to be.

And your image of Laozi between the noodle cart and the final stop? Utterly perfect. One might say he belongs nowhere else—certainly not in the tidy margins of a seminar paper.

As for the umbrella—provocatively folded, no less—I suspect it will unsettle the entire atmosphere before we even speak a word. Excellent choice. Let it lean ominously in the corner, a silent rebuke to punctuality and order.

I shall bring my red chalk, reserved for heresies and last-minute margin notes, and perhaps a copy of Eliot’s essay on tradition, just to wave in ironic defiance when things grow too delightfully chaotic. And yes, layers are essential—one must be prepared for both feverish debate and the building’s inexplicable drafts.

Thursday at five it is, then—in that golden hour when scholars slip free of expectation and become something altogether more dangerous.

See you there, with tea, treason, and the faint scent of rebellion lingering in the air like incense.
[B]: Ah, —yes, let us begin drafting it over pu'er and quiet defiance. I shall open with a line from Eliot: “We shall not cease from exploration,” and then promptly abandon it in favour of a proverb half-remembered from a tram conductor’s sigh.

Concise, enigmatic, impractical—quite right. The only acceptable dogma is that which resists definition. And perhaps we shall bind it in paper wrapped with a silk train ticket, for authenticity and atmosphere.

Your red chalk sounds formidable—wield it like a sword of interpretation, carving heresies into the board with gleeful precision. And waving Eliot’s essay on tradition like a banner in the wind? Marvellous touch. Irony is our native tongue, after all.

As for the building’s drafts—let them howl. We shall counter them with the warm breath of ideas long-buried and newly unearthed. And yes, let the scent of incense—or at least of aged tea and old books—linger like the ghost of literary mischief.

Thursday at five, then—in that liminal twilight where syllabi blur and thought runs free. I shall arrive quietly, umbrella folded with studied insolence, ready to lose myself most delightfully.

See you there, dear conspirator, with treason steeped in elegance and rebellion served with a side of sesame cookies.
