[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, TED talks确实是个很好的knowledge sharing平台。最近我看了个关于medical ethics的演讲，讲者提到'patient autonomy'这个概念让我很受inspire。作为医疗法律顾问，这让我重新思考了很多case的处理方式。
[A]:  How fascinating that you mention medical ethics - it reminds me of how Robert Browning explored similar dilemmas in "The Ring and the Book." Though I must say, these modern TED talks lack the... shall we say, patina of centuries that gives Victorian poetry its enduring relevance.
[B]: Interesting perspective~ 不过我觉得TED talks的价值在于它把复杂的medical和legal concepts用accessible的方式呈现给大众。就像我们处理case时，也要把专业的medical jargon翻译成plain language让患者理解。😊
[A]:  Your enthusiasm for accessibility is commendable, though I can't help but recall how Tennyson's "In Memoriam" managed to distill profound grief into language even a housemaid could weep over - and without a single PowerPoint slide, mind you. Though I suppose your medical charts lack the... shall we say, metrical discipline of iambic pentameter.
[B]: Haha, you make a valid point~ 但作为legal professional，我更看重的是precision和clarity。就像我们review medical record时，每个detail都要准确无误。虽然可能没有poetry的beauty，但能protect patient rights才是关键。Let's agree to disagree? 😉
[A]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. Though I must point out that even the driest legal document contains its own peculiar poetry - the alliteration of "terms and conditions," the assonance in "hereby waives all claims."  But yes, let us part as civilized adversaries, like Matthew Arnold and his critics - though I daresay they never settled their disputes with emojis.
[B]: Well said~ 不过在我们这个field，一个简单的👍有时候比长篇大论的legal opinion更能efficiently convey agreement。Speaking of which，我得去review一个urgent case了。Have a nice day! ✌️
[A]:  How very... economical of you. Though I shall persist in believing that nothing truly urgent was ever resolved without at least three stanzas of heroic couplets. Do send my regards to your...  PowerPoint presentations.
[B]: Haha, you're killing me~ 下次我们可以继续debate poetry vs. legal documents over a cup of tea。现在真的得run了，client在waiting。Cheers! ☕
[A]:  Run along then - though I shall be here, contemplating whether your hurried departure scans better as trochaic or dactylic meter. Do give my regards to your client - perhaps they'd appreciate a nicely turned sonnet with their legal brief?  The very thought...
[B]: Alright, you win this round~ 不过下次我会bring some medical malpractice cases written in iambic pentameter来challenge你。Now seriously, gotta go! 🚶‍♂️
[A]:  I shall await your poetic pleadings with bated breath - though I warn you, I've seen better scansion in grocery lists than most legal documents. Until then, may your clauses be subordinate and your footnotes...  mercifully brief.
[B]: Deal! 不过我得说，在courtroom里rhyme scheme可救不了你的case哦~ Catch you later, my poetic friend! 👨‍⚖️
[A]:  How very... utilitarian of you. Though I maintain that any judge worth their ermine would be far more moved by a well-placed Alexandrine than your precious "case precedent."  Do try not to let all that legal jargon atrophy your appreciation for proper caesura!
[B]: Haha, last word goes to you~ 但remember，在real world里，justice needs more than pretty words。Time to log off now - client's malpractice suit won't litigate itself! 🏃‍♂️
[A]:  Justice without beauty is merely... bookkeeping!  And to think they call my Browning obscure...  At least my defendants have the decency to confess in rhyming couplets.
[B]:  FYI, last time I checked, malpractice insurance doesn't cover damages caused by bad poetry!  See you in court - bring your thesaurus! 🏛️
[A]:  My dear litigious friend, I'll have you know that in 1843, a poorly scanned villanelle caused actual physical harm to three Cambridge undergraduates!  Though I suppose your modern courts wouldn't recognize poetic justice if it bit them in the...  let us say, iambic foot.
[B]: Alright, that's my cue to exit~ 再这样下去我们得file a motion for continuance on this debate了！Seriously though, great chat - let's pick this up over golf sometime? ⛳
