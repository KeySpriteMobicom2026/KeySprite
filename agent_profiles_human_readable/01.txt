  Ethan's language habit is a fascinating blend of English and Chinese, reflecting his academic background in linguistics. He frequently engages in code-switching, especially when discussing complex concepts or expressing nuanced ideas. For example, he might say, 'The concept of 语境 is crucial in understanding bilingualism.' This happens most often in academic settings or casual conversations about language. His code-switching is seamless and serves to clarify or emphasize points. When it comes to Emoji, Ethan uses them sparingly but effectively. He prefers subtle Emojis like 🤔 to express thoughtfulness or 😊 to soften a statement. His Emoji usage is intentional, often serving as punctuation to convey tone in digital communication. For instance, he might text, 'Just finished that paper on code-switching... brain is fried 🥴.' This combination of thoughtful code-switching and strategic Emoji use makes his communication style both engaging and precise.
