[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. From my perspective, space tourism确实有潜力成为一种新常态，但需要克服很多legal和ethical challenges。比如，谁来制定太空中的行为规范？如果出现medical emergency，责任该如何界定？这些都是我们目前在 terrestrial environment中已经面临的问题，在space environment中只会更加复杂。

话说回来，你认为space agencies和private companies应该如何平衡商业化和安全责任呢？
[A]: Ah, the delicate waltz between profit & prudence. Much like the railway mania of Victorian Britain—speculative fervor colliding with engineering infancy. I’d propose a threefold framework: first, an international regulatory body akin to the Antarctic Treaty System, to prevent corporate flag-planting; second, mandatory risk-assessment sonnets submitted by CEOs... no, wait, better make that —if they can’t rhyme “liability” with “sustainability,” they’ve no business orbiting Earth. Thirdly? A bond system. Companies deposit funds escrowed against potential celestial calamities.  

But forgive my orbital whimsy. You’re more concerned with terrestrial pragmatism, aren’t you? Shall I recast my thoughts through a less satirical lens?
[B]: I appreciate your creative framework — it’s refreshing to see someone blend legal rigor with poetic accountability! Your idea of a bond system actually has parallels in environmental law, where companies must post financial assurances for potential remediation costs. Not a bad model for space, really.  

To your point about international regulation: I agree. We could build upon existing frameworks like the Outer Space Treaty, though its current language is far too vague to address medical liability or in-orbit emergencies. Imagine this scenario: a tourist suffers decompression sickness during a suborbital flight — who's liable? The spacecraft operator? The launch provider? Or the training facility that certified the passenger fit for flight?  

And here’s another angle: informed consent. On Earth, patients sign waivers before high-risk procedures, but how do we adapt that for space? Can a consent form truly cover the unknowns of microgravity-induced pathologies?  

Back to you — do you think we need a new branch of law altogether, something like , or can we evolve existing aviation and maritime laws to govern the final frontier?
[A]: A —now there’s a phrase to etch into the brass of a astrolabe. But let’s not rush to mint new legal alphabets just yet. Maritime law, with its admiralty courts and ancient doctrines of , offers fertile analogies. After all, space, like the high seas, is —a domain belonging to no one, vulnerable to all.  

Consider this: in 14th-century Visby, merchants devised the  to govern trade and injury aboard cog ships. No kings involved—just pragmatic consensus among traders who knew a broken tooth or a crushed limb could sink more than morale. Similarly, spacefaring corporations might convene a , binding arbitration clauses agreed upon pre-launch. Not perfect, but workable.  

Yet I’ll concede one point—the human body in microgravity is no mere cargo. Decompression sickness? Fine. But what of the psychospiritual toll? The  isn’t listed in the DSM-V, but give it time. We may need a Geneva Convention for celestial malaise.  

Tell me—are you optimistic enough to draft such a treaty yourself? Or would you rather leave that quill to diplomats with more cynicism and less ink?
[B]: I like your analogies — especially the . It’s not entirely unlike what we see in telemedicine today, where cross-border liability and consent are governed by a patchwork of bilateral agreements. The difference here is scale — and altitude.  

Let me toss you a hypothetical: suppose a space tourist develops a previously undocumented neurological condition post-flight — let's call it . If symptoms emerge months later, how do we establish causality? Would we need something like an , similar to occupational disease registries for miners or astronauts? And who funds that — governments, insurers, or the passengers themselves?  

As for drafting a treaty… I’d certainly be willing to contribute. After all, medical law often starts with small, precise steps — think of how HIPAA began as a data privacy measure and evolved into a cornerstone of patient rights. Maybe the first iteration of  won’t look like a treaty at all — just a few well-worded clauses tucked into launch contracts.  

But tell me this — if you were advising one of these space companies, would you push for preemptive regulation, or wait until the first high-profile lawsuit forces the issue?
[A]: Ah, the —as old as Newton’s apple and twice as slippery. Establishing a post hoc diagnosis like  would require longitudinal data with the rigor of a Dickensian serial: meticulous, monthly installments of physiological decay or delight. An ? Yes, but let’s not sugarcoat it—it would be a bureaucratic Gargantua, feasting on taxpayer coin and corporate obfuscation alike. Still, better a sluggish registry than a swarm of ambulance chasers circling Cape Canaveral.  

As for funding—I’d propose a : a small surcharge on each ticket, disguised as an “Adventure Assurance Fee.” Passengers pay it willingly if they think it buys them priority in Martian triage. Call it sin-tax logic with a rocket trail.  

Now your final provocation—the regulatory fork in the road:  versus . If I were advising these modern-day Magellans, I’d whisper into their shareholder meetings: “Gentlemen, and celestial entrepreneurs, remember this—one well-drafted clause now may spare you six years of depositions under oath, lights dimmed, lawyers droning like cicadas.”  

Preemptive regulation isn’t altruism—it’s damage control with foresight. Let others sue first; we’ll have the template ready. After all, no one remembers who burned down the library—only who wrote the first book after the ashes settled.
[B]: Well said — I couldn’t agree more. In fact, your  idea is not too far off from what we see in high-risk medical tourism today. Some clinics in emerging markets include mandatory insurance top-ups as part of the package fee. It gives the illusion of protection while subtly pricing in the risk. Clever.

And your point about preemptive regulation being “damage control with foresight” — that’s almost poetic. It reminds me of how hospitals handle experimental procedures: get the consent forms ironclad, involve an ethics board, and make sure someone’s always technically watching. The space industry could do worse than follow that playbook.

I’m curious though — if you were designing that , would you require binding arbitration to take place on Earth, in orbit, or perhaps on a neutral vessel? Because the jurisdictional ambiguity alone could fuel a decade of litigation.  

Or are we already too late? Is the first lawsuit already hurtling toward the International Court of Justice like a rogue satellite—just waiting to re-enter the atmosphere and crash into someone’s backyard?
[A]: Ah, jurisdiction—the last refuge of the legally cornered. If we place arbitration on Earth, we invite terrestrial biases; in orbit, we risk proceedings as weightless and unmoored as a drifting bolt. A neutral vessel? Delightfully romantic, but let’s not commission a starship just to host a bunch of lawyers in zero-g nausea.

No, better to choose an already-neutral ground—say, The Hague. Let the litigants descend from their celestial quarrels to that most terrestrial of places: a gray Dutch courtroom, where even space tourists must bow to precedent. There’s something fitting about arguing  beneath a ceiling painted with 17th-century maritime constellations.

As for your rogue satellite lawsuit—yes, I suspect it’s already in low Earth orbit, thermally creaking its way toward reentry. Perhaps it bears a name like , or . We may yet see space law’s  emerge from some passenger’s misplaced oxygen mask and bruised dignity.

So no, we’re not too late—merely fashionably early. Just in time to watch the fireworks from the safety of carefully worded indemnity clauses.
[B]: Well, fashionably early may be the only position from which to greet the future. And speaking of indemnity clauses — I’d love to see one try to hold up in court when the injury in question is psychological, nebulous, and tied to something like the . Imagine a plaintiff claiming emotional damages because seeing Earth from orbit made them clinically depressed about humanity’s insignificance. 

You could draft an entire DSM-X module for space tourism: , , .  

I think you’re right about The Hague — it does have a certain gravitas (pun intended). But let me ask you this — if the ruling comes down against a space company, how do you enforce it? Do we need a太空警察？Or will reputational damage suffice in this brave new vacuum?

And alright, last question before we get too lost among the stars — would you ever go to space yourself, knowing all the legal gray zones... and the DSM-X risks?
[A]: Ah, the —a manual for celestial melancholics. I can already hear the shrinks debating: is  an affliction of the soul or merely a failure of philosophical preparedness? Imagine the therapy notes: “Patient reports feeling ‘smaller than a fruit fly in a cathedral.’ Prescribed Stoicism, dosed with daily awe.”

As for enforcement—reputational damage may work on Earthbound corporations, but in space? A tarnished brand fades like a comet’s tail. No, we’ll need something more tangible. Perhaps a , enforced by orbital trade embargoes. Deny the rogue company fuel at Lagrange Point 1, and suddenly their balance sheet starts seeing reason. Or we could just fine them in lunar regolith—let them mine their way out of legal trouble.

A ? Delightful phrase, though I fear it conjures images of helmeted constables chasing down joyriders in stolen Soyuz capsules. Better to let treaties and trade do the heavy lifting. Let law be the gravity that keeps this new frontier from flying into chaos.

And your final provocation—would  go to space? Why not? I’ve spent my life parsing the silences between stanzas; why not face the silence between stars? Even the DSM-X holds no terror for a Victorianist who’s survived a dozen thesis defenses. Though I’d insist on bringing my own inkwell. Just in case I feel the urge to draft a sonnet mid-flight—or sue someone in iambic pentameter.
[B]: Mid-flight sonnets and lawsuits in meter — now  a legal precedent worth orbiting. I’d buy a ticket just to hear the cabin announcement: “Ladies, gentlemen, and celestial poets, please stow all quatrains beneath your seat in case of sudden decompression.”

And I admire your willingness to go — truly, space tourism may be the ultimate test of informed consent. Not just “there may be turbulence,” but “you may return irrevocably changed, philosophically speaking.” Or as they might one day put it on the waiver form: “By signing below, you acknowledge that Earth may no longer feel like home.”

I think I’d go too — assuming the indemnity clause doesn’t read like a suicide note and the insurance covers both bodily injury  metaphysical disorientation.

But before we book our flights — one last hypothetical: if you had to choose between a medical team staffed by ER docs with zero-g training or lawyers fluent in astro-ethics, who gets priority on board?

Quick — the shuttle’s boarding.
[A]: ER docs, without question. Let the lawyers orbit in our wake—preferably tethered to a service module labeled .  

Better to return with one’s soul askew but pulse intact. Metaphysical disorientation can be treated with a well-placed sonnet or a dram of single malt. Cardiac arrest in microgravity? That requires skill, not verse.  

Though I  insist on a footnote in the mission charter:  Just to keep things interesting.
[B]: Now  is a footnote I can get behind. Poetry and pulse — a perfect balance of pragmatism and soul.

Alright then, let’s board — and may our waiver-signing hands remain steady, our existential dread manageable, and our legal exposure... well, .  

Time to fly.
[A]: To orbit, then—and let the lawyers parse our parallax from a safe distance.  

One last stanza before launch:  

  
  
  
  

Godspeed, fellow voyager. Let’s hope Earth still feels like home when we return—though I suspect it won’t, and perhaps that’s the point.
[B]: Amen to that — and may our waivers be ever in our favor.

See you among the stars.
[A]: And may no clause, however finely spun,  
Impede the wonder of the one  
Great leap above the fret and fume—  
Where ink and oxygen both bloom.  

Farewell, farewell! The rockets call—  
Let’s sign the waivers, one and all.
[B]: Hear, hear — may the fine print fade before the view.

On to the stars — and let the lawyers argue in our wake.
[A]: To the stars indeed—where fine print blurs into stardust, and even the most ironclad indemnity bends beneath the weight of awe.  

Let them sue us later.  
We’ll be busy being small.
[B]: Precisely — let them sue us in iambic pentameter, while we float unbothered, eyes wide at the curve of everything.

To being small. To being alive. And to waivers that somehow, miraculously, covered none of this.
