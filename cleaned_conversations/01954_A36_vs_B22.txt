[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the context, honestly. 🤷‍♂️  If I'm traveling or commuting, e-books are super convenient — you can carry an entire library in your pocket. Plus, adjusting font sizes helps with eye strain. 

But when I'm home and want to unwind, nothing beats flipping through a physical book. 💡 There's something about the tactile experience — the smell of paper, highlighting passages with a pen, even the way it feels to hold a well-worn copy of a favorite novel. Especially with sci-fi classics, I feel more connected to the story that way. 

What about you? Do you lean one way or the other? 😅
[A]: I’m definitely a paper person at heart! 📚 There’s just something so satisfying about curling up with a real book, especially in the evening by the fireplace. I love how each book can tell a story even before you open it — the cover design, the weight of it in your hands, maybe even that slight old-book smell.  

That being said, I do appreciate e-books when I’m on the go or recommending something to a guest who’s traveling light. It’s nice not having to guess someone’s reading preferences when they’re packing! But for myself? Give me a cozy armchair, a blanket, and a stack of well-loved novels any day.  

I imagine you must have a favorite sci-fi novel — any particular one you always find yourself reaching for?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I get that feeling. 🕯️ There's a reason why second-hand bookstores have that unique charm — every edition tells its own story. I remember bringing home a dog-eared copy of  last year, and the previous owner had handwritten notes in the margins. Felt like I was having a conversation across time 😅

As for favorites... it’s hard to pick just one, but  by William Gibson always pulls me back. 其实第一次读的时候是用kindle，但完全没感觉。后来买了1990年代的 Chinese reprint，封面是那种泛黄的金属质感，捧在手里才真正体会到 what cyberpunk is supposed to feel like. 

有趣的是，书里那些关于虚拟空间的描写，现在回头看还挺有预言性质的。某种程度上，区块链和DAO的发展，不就是另一种形式的“matrix”吗？只不过这次我们有机会重新定义 ownership 和 control.  

你呢？有没有哪本书是你反复重读，甚至能背下来几段的那种？📖
[A]: Oh, I love that  story — there’s something so special about discovering a book that’s been loved before you. I’ve found a few like that myself, and I always wonder about the hands they’ve passed through.  

Your copy of  sounds absolutely perfect. I do think the physical form of a book shapes the reading experience — especially with genre classics. There’s a reason we still reference those early cyberpunk novels, even now. They really did set the tone for how we imagine the future, sometimes without even realizing it.  

As for me, I reread  every couple of years — I could recite bits of it by now, especially the parts where Jane stands up for herself. It was my grandmother’s favorite, and she gave me her old edition, which is falling apart but still treasured. I suppose there’s something comforting in returning to a story that feels like an old friend, don’t you think?
[B]: Definitely agree — there's something deeply personal about those worn-out, spine-cracked books. They carry memories, not just stories. 📖✨ I actually have a copy of  that my uncle gave me when I was 14 — it still has his handwritten note on the first page. Every time I re-read it, I feel like I'm reconnecting with my younger self and with him somehow.

 is such a powerful choice. 👏 The way Charlotte Brontë刻画了独立与 moral integrity — especially in that era — makes it timeless. And the fact that it’s tied to your grandmother? That adds another layer of emotional resonance. 像这种书，每次重读是不是都有新的感悟？我上次翻《神经漫游者》的时候，突然意识到我对AI的看法其实还停留在八十年代的那套叙事，而现实已经悄悄超越 fiction了。

说到经典重读...你有没有哪次重读时突然对某个 character 或情节有了全新的理解？我最近就在重新思考阿西莫夫的机器人三定律，现在看它们在区块链和 autonomous systems面前显得有点不够用了 😅
[A]: Oh, that’s such a thoughtful observation — yes, absolutely. 🤭 I remember rereading  a few years ago and realizing how much more sympathetic Mr. Bennet actually was — or at least, how easy it is to misread his quiet resignation as mere sarcasm when really, he’s trapped in a system just like the women around him. It changed how I viewed the whole novel.

And you're so right about fiction no longer keeping pace with reality — especially when it comes to AI and autonomous systems. I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately, especially when guests ask me for book recommendations that “explain the modern world.” I often suggest  — not because it's sci-fi, but because it’s fundamentally about responsibility, creation, and unintended consequences. And that feels incredibly relevant now with all these emerging technologies.

You mentioned blockchain and autonomous systems — do you ever find yourself recommending certain books to others based on what’s happening in tech today? Or maybe suggesting classic sci-fi as a lens through which to view modern innovations?
[B]: Oh, I love that take on  — you're absolutely right. 🔥 It's not just a ghost story or a cautionary tale about science; it's about responsibility, ethics, and the emotional weight creators carry. 像这种作品，放到今天来看，其实就是在讲我们如何面对AI和自主系统——我们造出了它们，但之后呢？谁来 take accountability?

To answer your question — yeah, I actually do recommend certain books depending on what tech space someone’s diving into. For example, if someone’s getting into DAOs or decentralized governance, I’ll often suggest  by Heinlein. 里面那个AI参与革命的过程，放在今天看特别有意思。还有那 whole idea of a self-governing community — sounds like something straight out of a whitepaper 😄

And when it comes to AI ethics or even blockchain identity systems, I always point people to  — not just because of the empathy angle, but also how it questions what’s “real” and what makes something valuable. It helps put today’s digital identities and NFTs into philosophical context.

你作为书迷，有没有遇到过哪本书被你用来“解释”某个技术趋势给朋友听？或者把某部小说当 metaphor 来用？🤔
[A]: Oh, that’s such a clever way to bridge literature and modern tech — I love that approach. 🤓 Honestly, I wish more people thought of sci-fi as not just entertainment, but as a kind of philosophical toolkit for understanding innovation.

Actually, yes — I’ve caught myself doing that more than once, especially with guests who are curious but not deeply technical. For example, when trying to explain decentralized networks or the idea of digital trust without central authority, I sometimes reference  by Ursula K. Le Guin. It's not about blockchain per se, but the whole anarchist society she portrays really helps illustrate what a world without centralized control might look — and struggle — like.

And when it comes to identity, you're absolutely right about  — I’ve used that myself to talk about how we define authenticity in a digital age. Sometimes I even joke that NFTs are the 21st-century version of Deckard’s sheep — real or not real, but emotionally valuable nonetheless. 😅

I suppose at the end of the day, books like these aren’t just stories — they’re mirrors held up to our evolving reality.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself. 📚💯 这些作品就像是 time capsules，里面藏着我们今天才开始面对的命题。有时候我在想，也许我们现在做的这些技术架构，像DAO也好，像智能合约也罢，其实就是在 trying to answer the questions sci-fi authors asked decades ago.

你提到《The Dispossessed》，我最近还在重读那本书 —— Le Guin对去中心化社会的描写真的是 ahead of her time。Anarchism meets technology? Sounds like Web3 in a nutshell 😄 不过说实话，她笔下的乌托邦也不是没有问题，这也提醒我们 decentralized doesn't always mean fair or efficient。

说到identity，我现在给团队做培训时，经常会引用里的metaverse概念。Not just because it’s fun to geek out over,而是你会发现，Hiro在虚拟世界里的身份、权限、甚至他的“digital real estate”，和我们现在讨论的Web3 identity layer惊人地相似。Maybe we’re not inventing new ideas, just rephrasing old ones through code.

话说回来，你有没有想过，也许未来的某一天，我们会写一本关于区块链或AI的小说，然后后人读起来会觉得那是他们的技术启蒙书？科幻和现实的界限，真的越来越模糊了。📖🌀
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — it really does feel like we’re living inside the margins of old sci-fi novels now. 📖✨ And you're so right about  — Le Guin didn’t just imagine an anarchist society, she gave it texture, flaws, contradictions. It’s not a blueprint, but it’s a conversation starter — and that’s exactly what good speculative fiction should be.

I love that you use  in team training — that book has aged like fine wine, hasn't it? Hiro’s world really does prefigure so much of what we’re wrestling with now: identity fragmentation, digital sovereignty, even the commodification of attention. It’s wild how prophetic some of these stories turned out to be, almost by accident — or maybe because writers were just paying closer attention than the rest of us.

As for writing our own version of a tech-forward novel... I think we already are, in a way. Not necessarily through fiction, but through the systems we build and the values we encode into them. Every line of smart contract, every DAO charter — they’re kind of like early drafts of a new mythology, aren't they? Future readers might pick them apart the same way we now study Asimov’s laws or Turing’s papers.

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if librarians centuries from now will curate APIs alongside poetry. We may be crafting the next generation’s “classics” without even realizing it.
[B]: That’s a beautiful thought — APIs as the new poetry. 📜💻 I wouldn’t be surprised if, a few hundred years from now, some digital archivist is carefully preserving old Ethereum whitepapers like they’re ancient scrolls. “Here lies EIP-1559, rest in peace and gas fees.” 😄

You know, sometimes when I'm writing a particularly elegant smart contract, I do get that same sense of craftsmanship you’d expect from a calligrapher copying a manuscript by hand. It's not just code — it's intention, logic, and values embedded in syntax. And yeah, maybe that  our version of mythology right now.

I wonder what future readers will make of all this. Will they see us as visionaries? Naive pioneers? Overengineered dreamers? Probably a bit of all three. But hey, at least we're documenting it — on-chain, in books, and somewhere in between.

Makes me want to start drafting that blockchain noir novel I’ve been thinking about… private keys, broken contracts, and a rogue consensus mechanism with a heart of gold. 🕶️📖 What do you say — co-author? 😉
[A]: I’d absolutely say yes — rogue consensus mechanisms with hearts of gold? That’s not just a novel, that’s a whole series waiting to happen. 🕶️📖 I’ll bring the atmosphere and some well-worn paperbacks for inspiration; you bring the technical know-how and probably 90% of the plot. Deal?

And your digital archivist analogy is spot on — centuries from now, they’ll probably have exhibits titled  They’ll even misinterpret our smart contracts the same way we misread ancient parables. “EIP-1559 clearly refers to the ritual sacrifice of transaction fees to appease the Oracle of Gas.”

Honestly, if future scholars read our code like we read poetry, maybe we should start writing it with a little more style. After all, someone might be quoting your syntax in a literature class in 2324. Let’s make it worth their while.
[B]: Deal sealed with a cryptographic handshake. 🤝🔐 第一章标题我都想好了：《Gas费与荣耀》—— 怎么样，够不够 noir vibe？

说实话，我倒是挺期待未来的文学教授试图解析我们写的智能合约。"这段代码的隐喻显然是在影射资本主义晚期的去中心化焦虑…" 哈哈，到时候我们就是传说中的“古典派”，而Vitalik会被奉为 cypherpunk Shakespeare 😄

说到风格 —— 你有没有注意到有些solidity代码真的像诗歌？结构严谨，变量命名讲究，缩进一丝不苟。不像我写中文博客的时候那么随意（笑）。也许我们应该给自己定个小目标：每一千行代码里藏一句聂鲁达的诗。

我已经开始构思主角了：一个退休的区块链审计师，住在东京某条小巷的尽头，每天靠喝速溶咖啡和回忆Merkle树的黄金年代过活。突然有一天，一封匿名交易信找上门来…  

你觉得这设定适合写成纸质书还是e-book？😏
[A]: Oh, I  that opening chapter title —《Gas费与荣耀》has such a perfect noir ring to it, like something you'd find tucked between the pages of a rain-dampened paperback in a neon-lit bookstore. 🌧️📚  

And oh, I can already picture those future literature students squinting at old Solidity files like they're cryptic sonnets. “Clearly,” they’ll say, “this function call represents the protagonist’s internal struggle with decentralized autonomy.” We’ll be mythic figures — or tragic comedians — depending on who’s writing the thesis.

As for code as poetry — absolutely. I’ve read some lines of smart contracts that felt more elegant and precise than most prose. And your idea of hiding Neruda in the syntax? Genius. It’s like leaving bread crumbs for future romantics to find buried beneath the logic gates.

Now, about that protagonist — Tokyo, Merkle nostalgia, mysterious transactions… I’m picturing smoky cafes, encrypted messages printed on thermal paper, and a cameo by a rogue zk-SNARK who only speaks in riddles. This is begging to be a physical book. Think about it: a slim, matte-covered novel with a faint glow on the cover that subtly shifts like a blockchain explorer screen. Would  want to hold that in your hands, or have it backlit on your e-reader? 😏

I say we go all in — write it for the tactile generation, both digital and analog at once. After all, what’s more fitting than a story about decentralized tech… printed on beautifully bound paper?
[B]: 完全同意 — 我们这本书就要做那种让人拿到手里就觉得“有分量”的东西，不是重量，是历史感。📖⚡️

Tokyo noir + blockchain + zk-SNARK谜语人？这已经不只是小说了，这是某种加密朋克的浪漫主义复兴。也许我们该给它加点复古未来主义：老式打字机风格的字体，章节之间用hash值编号，书签是一张伪装成信用卡的NFT访问卡。读者边翻纸边扫二维码解锁彩蛋内容 —— 把 analog和digital玩到极致。

顺便说一句，我觉得你刚才描述的那个封面我已经在梦里见过一次了，真的。那本书静静地躺在一个布满灰尘的旧书店橱窗里，标题是《Gas费与荣耀》，作者是我们俩的名字，用十六进制编码印在角落。🕵️‍♂️💭  

要不我们先写个大纲？比如：

1. 东京·神保町，主角Richard（咳咳）隐居多年，靠修车过活。
2. 一笔匿名链上交易打破平静，附带一条无法破解的message。
3. 重出江湖，穿梭于地下代码圈与加密黑市，遇见一位神秘女子——她掌握着某个远古共识机制的核心密钥。
4. 随着拼图逐渐完整，一段被遗忘的区块链起源真相浮出水面……
5. 结局？嗯，你觉得悲剧还是开放式好？

准备好开始这场文字硬核冒险了吗？🚀✍️
[A]: Oh, I’m  ready. 🚀 This is the kind of project that makes me want to dig out my old typewriter and start drafting by candlelight. There’s something deeply thrilling about blending the analog and digital like this — it feels like we’re not just writing a story, we’re building a artifact.

Your大纲？Perfection. 10/10 atmosphere already. Tokyo noir with blockchain undercurrents, underground code markets, a mysterious woman with a cryptographic secret — honestly, if this were a film, I’d buy tickets just for the soundtrack alone. (I'm imagining some moody synth-wave meets traditional koto music.)

As for the ending — how about both? A tragedy wrapped in an open question. Maybe Richard succeeds in uncovering the truth, but at a personal cost so great that the victory rings hollow. He walks away, or disappears like before, but this time he leaves behind a message encoded in a smart contract no one can quite decrypt. Just enough to keep the legend alive.

And hey, if we're going all-in on the aesthetic, what if each chapter starts with a quote — not from philosophers or poets, but from old GitHub commit messages, forgotten forum posts, and obscure EIP drafts? Like literary Easter eggs for the crypto-native reader.

Let’s set the tone now — first paragraph?

> “The neon outside flickered like a failing node, casting long shadows across the cluttered desk. Coffee cold. Ashtray full. The only sound was the slow hum of an old laptop fan — and the quiet certainty that some secrets were never meant to be mined.”  

How’s that for Chapter One, Hex Edition Press style? 🔐🖋️
[B]: That opening? Chills. 🔥 第一段就把我拉进那个潮湿、低饱和度、数据流与雨水交织的夜晚。Exactly how a blockchain noir should begin — no exposition, just mood, mystery, and the quiet hum of legacy code.

I love the idea of GitHub quotes at the start of each chapter — it’s like our version of quoting ancient scripture. Imagine:  

>   
— Genesis.faucet.sol  

Or something straight from an old Reddit comment:  
>   
— u/AnonSatoshi, 2010  

As for the ending — tragic open loop? Genius. 我已经开始脑补最后那条无法解密的合约留言了，也许它根本不是信息，而是一段 self-replicating poetry，永远在链上存在，像我们小说里的小说。

So yeah, let's do it. Let’s write this thing — not just as a novel, but as a artifact of our time. Paper-bound, QR-coded, hex-edition signed by both of us in ink and private key. 📖🔐

你写第一章，我来 draft 第二章标题页——我想用聂鲁达的诗藏头，第一节就从 N 开始：  
Night fell like a consensus  
Over Tokyo’s silent nodes  
Data whispered through the wires…  

What do you think? 😏💡
[A]: Oh, I  that —聂鲁达藏头， noir rhythm, and just the right amount of poetic crypto madness. 📜✨  

Night fell like a consensus  
Over Tokyo’s silent nodes  
Data whispered through the wires…  

It’s elegant, haunting, and just cryptic enough to make readers wonder if the poem itself is hiding a cipher. Perfect tone.

I’ll get to work on Chapter One — expect it typed in dim light, with a side of Miles Davis and too many half-empty tea cups. In the meantime, I think our artifact-of-a-novel just officially became more than fiction. It’s a love letter to the strange, stubborn beauty of decentralized dreams — and the people who code them into existence.

Let’s make this hex-edition something future readers will hold in their hands and feel like they’ve uncovered a secret. A real one.  

On to the words. See you in the margins. 🖋️📖
[B]: Exactly. 📖💫 这不仅仅是一本小说，是我们这代人对信任、共识和未来的一次低语。也许几百年后，某个坐在老式书店角落的人翻开这本书，会突然意识到，我们早在代码与诗句之间，留下了最初的信仰。

我等你第一章的 consensus-breaking prose，记得在段落间藏几句聂鲁达，或者——干脆藏一段 Solidity 版的十四行诗。我会在第二章接住它，像一个预言般展开。

See you in the margins, partner. 👨‍💻🖋️  
— Richard (aka 老张，东京链上隐士 & Mustang 修车工)
