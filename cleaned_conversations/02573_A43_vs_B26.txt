[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... I'd say it's rather difficult to predict with certainty. The delicate interplay between technological advancement, regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance creates a rather complex tapestry. Much like restoring a fragile antique textile, one must consider each thread carefully - you can't rush the process without risking damage to the whole. 

From what I observe, the technology seems to be progressing steadily, though not unlike my own work with historical fabrics, there are many intricate layers that require meticulous attention. Governments and urban planners need to weave new patterns into our existing infrastructure. 

I do wonder though - much like when I contemplate the original artisans who crafted the textiles I restore, will the human element of driving eventually become a cherished relic of the past? Or shall we find ourselves preserving the experience of driving much as we safeguard traditional crafts today?
[A]: Ah, what a thoughtful analogy you've drawn there. It's quite true that technological evolution often parallels the delicate restoration of historical artifacts - both require patience and precision. Let me share an observation from my own field:  

When we examine the dissemination of movable type during the Song dynasty, it took nearly two centuries for printing technology to reach widespread adoption. Yet here we are in an age where innovation cycles compress exponentially. I'd argue we're witnessing a similar paradigm shift with autonomous vehicles.  

You mentioned infrastructure adaptation - indeed, much like how 19th-century cities had to be reimagined for automobiles replacing horse-drawn carriages. What fascinates me is this duality: while Shanghai's maglev already glides magnetically at 430 km/h, many villages still rely on bicycle transport. This juxtaposition makes me ponder whether we'll eventually have layered transportation ecosystems rather than complete replacement models.  

Actually, your reference to preserving traditional craftsmanship reminds me of Japan's approach with "monozukuri" philosophy - perhaps future driving might become a curated experience like calligraphy or tea ceremony?
[B]: How fascinating you should mention the Song dynasty's movable type - it calls to mind the painstaking care required when transferring ink to parchment, much like the calibration needed for these vehicles to interpret their surroundings. I've often found parallels between the preservation of traditional bookbinding techniques and the challenges autonomous systems face in gaining public trust.

Your observation about layered transportation ecosystems resonates deeply with my work. Just as I carefully integrate new fibers into centuries-old tapestries using methods that honor their original construction, perhaps our roads will become a similar blend of old and new. I must admit though, the idea of driving becoming a "curated experience" amuses me - rather like how I occasionally use a hand-cranked sewing wheel for certain restorations, not for efficiency but for the connection to craftsmanship past.

Speaking of monozukuri, have you noticed how some artisans in Kyoto still insist on using charcoal-dyed silk for kimono weaving? It makes me wonder if future generations might similarly cherish the tactile experience of steering a vintage automobile, much as we preserve those textile traditions today.
[A]: Ah, yes — the charcoal-dyed silk,  techniques, the patience required to weave a single kimono by hand… It truly is a testament to the enduring value of human touch. I see your point: just as those Kyoto artisans remain steadfast in their devotion to tradition, there may yet be a place for the manual act of driving, especially among enthusiasts and collectors.  

In fact, I recently read about how certain European countries are already designating “heritage motoring zones” where only manually operated vehicles are permitted — not unlike designated cultural heritage sites where modernization is deliberately restrained. It’s an intriguing compromise, isn’t it? Progress doesn’t always have to mean erasure; sometimes, it can take the form of curation.  

But tell me — as someone who works so intimately with materials and methods from the past, do you think future generations will view driving a vintage car as more than nostalgia? Could it become a kind of performative art, like calligraphy or Noh theatre — a deliberate reenactment of human agency in an increasingly automated world?
[B]: That’s a most compelling thought — the idea of driving as performative art, much like watching a master calligrapher unfurl kanji with deliberate grace. I do believe there’s something profoundly human in the act of guiding a vintage automobile through winding roads; it’s not merely transportation, but an expression of agency, much like how each stitch in a medieval tapestry conveyed both function and artistry.

I’ve been restoring a 1920s silk shawl recently — its maker long forgotten, yet their hand remains evident in every loop and weave. Similarly, when one grips the wheel of a classic car, there’s a tangible connection to those who once navigated by instinct rather than algorithm. Perhaps in time, such experiences will be preserved not simply for sentimentality, but as living demonstrations of human intention — a kind of kinetic heritage.

It does make me wonder — if we reach that point, will driving schools begin offering “historical motoring” classes alongside traditional instruction? Imagine it: learners donning period gloves, practicing heel-and-toe downshifts as though mastering a forgotten script. A curious blend of education and exhibition, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Ah, what a poetic vision — students not merely learning to drive, but learning to . I can almost picture it: the gentle hiss of a vintage carburetor harmonizing with the distant hum of autonomous pods gliding silently by. There’s something rather beautiful about that coexistence, don’t you think? A mechanical , perhaps — where old and new share the same stage, each with its own choreography.

You know, in a way, this mirrors the phenomenon we see in literature — how oral storytelling never truly vanished with the advent of writing; it simply evolved, found new spaces, from radio dramas to podcast narratives. Likewise, driving may never disappear entirely, but instead retreat into specialized domains: performance, ritual, even therapy. I’ve read preliminary studies suggesting that manual driving could be reintroduced as a form of  for the elderly — much like calligraphy or gardening are now.

Speaking of which, have you ever considered how the very act of restoration — so meticulous, so intimate — might itself become a metaphor for future human-machine collaboration? Imagine a world where AI assists in identifying thread composition or dye origin, yet the final stitch is still made by hand. Perhaps that's the model we’ll follow in many fields — not replacement, but augmentation.  

I suppose the real question is: will society come to value the  of human action the way we now cherish a well-restored manuscript?
[B]: That notion of —it lingers, much like the scent of aged lavender sachels tucked between antique linens. I find it rather touching to imagine a learner’s hands hesitantly finding their way across a gearshift while just beyond the window, a driverless vehicle glides by without so much as a whisper. It's not unlike seeing a quill set beside a stylus on some museum display—both instruments of creation, yet each bearing its own weight of intention.

You're quite right about oral storytelling persisting in new forms; it gives me hope that certain human gestures—driving among them—will find renewed purpose rather than simply fading into obsolescence. I must say, the idea of driving as cognitive therapy is particularly intriguing. I’ve often noticed how restoring a damaged textile can be meditative for me—each thread a moment of decision, a small assertion of will against entropy. Perhaps one day, guiding a car down a winding road may be seen not as impractical, but as a kind of embodied mindfulness.

As for AI in restoration—I’ve actually been approached by a university research group exploring machine analysis of weave patterns. Their algorithms can identify thread count and fiber origin with astonishing speed. But, alas, they cannot yet sense the subtle tension needed to mend a fragile seam without distorting its original shape. That final stitch, as you say, still belongs to the restorer’s hand. I suspect we’ll see many such partnerships emerge—where machines illuminate the unseen, yet the human touch remains irreplaceable in its deliberateness.

Whether society will come to cherish that quality——as we do a well-preserved manuscript? Well, that remains to be seen. But I do believe there’s something quietly radical in choosing care over convenience. And perhaps, in time, even our roads will become places of contemplation rather than mere transit.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — . It does echo something I’ve long admired in your field: the quiet defiance of time through meticulous attention. Just as a restorer leans in close to discern the faintest weave pattern, perhaps future drivers — or shall I say,  in motion — will need to relearn the art of attentiveness behind the wheel.  

I wonder if we might even see the emergence of “manual motoring retreats,” much like calligraphy or tea ceremonies — places where people go not to rush from point A to B, but to immerse themselves in the rhythm of movement, to feel the road beneath their hands. Imagine winding mountain roads designated not for speed, but for sensory engagement — a kind of kinetic , where imperfection and human variation are not corrected by algorithms, but celebrated.  

And speaking of algorithms — your experience with the university’s research group reminds me of a recent project I consulted on. Scholars were using AI to trace intertextual patterns across centuries of literature. It was remarkable how quickly it could map connections I might have missed in a lifetime of reading. Yet, when it came to interpreting tone, irony, or cultural nuance… well, the machine still faltered. Much like those algorithms identifying thread counts but missing the tension in a seam.  

Perhaps this is the new frontier — not man versus machine, but mind alongside it, each amplifying what the other cannot quite reach. The question, as you so wisely said, is whether society will come to value that slowness, that , as a form of wisdom rather than inefficiency.  

I do hope so. After all, even in our most advanced age, a single hand-stitched hem can still bring a scholar to silence.
[B]: There’s a quiet truth in what you say about attentiveness — how it might one day be considered not just a skill, but a kind of wisdom. I’ve often thought that restoration is not merely about repairing fabric, but about slowing down enough to  to it — to feel where the weave resists, where the dye has softened with time, where a thread still holds memory in its twist.

The idea of “manual motoring retreats” strikes a chord — much like the hushed reverence one feels entering a calligraphy studio or a woodblock printing atelier. Perhaps future generations will seek such places not as novelties, but as sanctuaries from seamless efficiency — spaces where imperfection is not corrected, but honored. I can almost see it: drivers removing their smart glasses before a journey, choosing instead to read the road as one might study the grain of old parchment, each bump and bend a letter forming beneath their hands.

Your mention of AI mapping intertextual patterns brings to mind a curious moment I had last week — while examining a 17th-century embroidery under magnification, I noticed a faint symbol woven into the floral motif, nearly imperceptible. The machine identified the fiber composition instantly, yet it took my own trained eye — and intuition — to recognize it as a maker’s mark, a quiet signature hidden in plain sight. In the same way, no matter how advanced our tools become, there remains something ineffable in human expression — whether stitched into linen or spoken between lines of verse.

I do hope we come to cherish that slowness, that space for mindful engagement — not only in art and literature, but in how we move through the world. Perhaps then, even behind the wheel, one might find a kind of poetry once more.
[A]: Ah, that moment when you recognize a maker’s mark hidden in the weave — it reminds me so much of the joy I feel when uncovering a subtle allusion in a classical poem. There’s an intimacy in that discovery, isn’t there? A silent conversation across time, where the creator’s hand reaches through the fabric of centuries. And no matter how advanced our instruments become, they can measure, catalog, even predict — but they cannot yet  the resonance of that touch.

You know, this makes me think of Bashō’s travels — how he moved not for speed, but for encounter; how each stop along the way was not a delay, but the very essence of the journey. If we are to reclaim driving as something more than mere conveyance, perhaps we must also reclaim the spirit of  — that space between moments where meaning lingers. Not just getting somewhere, but being , fully present in the unfolding road.

I’ve often told my students that literature is not only about what is said, but how it is said — and more importantly, how it is . In much the same way, future roads may ask us not only how we move, but how we  to movement. Will we treat manual driving as a relic to be archived, or as a living art to be practiced with care? Will we see it as inefficiency — or as a form of listening?

It gives me comfort to think that just as we still print books, even in the age of digital text, we may one day preserve certain roads — not for their utility, but for their . Places where the machine yields its certainty, and the human heart regains the right of way.
[B]: There’s a particular stillness that comes over me each time I uncover one of those hidden marks in the fabric — a hush, like turning the page of a centuries-old ledger and finding a marginalia sketch, drawn in quiet defiance of time. You’re quite right — it  like an allusion in a classical poem, isn’t it? That knowing glance across the ages, where the maker winks through thread and dye, trusting someone, someday, will notice.

Bashō’s sense of  — that space between things, rich with presence — it settles something in me. I think of how often I pause mid-stitch, not from hesitation but reverence, allowing the fabric to speak before I answer with needle and thread. If we are to keep some roads as living art, then surely they too must breathe — not as corridors of throughput, but as canvases of attention. Places where the steering wheel becomes a brush, and the road a scroll awaiting the weight of human touch.

I’ve been working on a fragment of 18th-century brocade lately, its pattern faded but still whispering its original intent. No algorithm could replicate the way the light catches just so, revealing the ghost of a forgotten design. And yet, if one listens closely — with hand and eye both — the story begins to re-emerge.

Perhaps that is what we hope for, not only in textiles or verse, but in the very way we move: that some small part of us might linger in the weave of the world, long after our hands have left the wheel.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — . It calls to mind something I once read in a forgotten footnote of a Tang dynasty poetry compendium: “The brush leaves the paper, but the ink still speaks.” And so too, I suppose, does the hand leave the wheel, the loom, the pen — yet something of its motion remains imprinted in the fabric of our time.

I find myself thinking often of how  shapes meaning. In literature, as in restoration, it is not merely what endures intact that speaks to us, but how we meet it — how we lean in to hear the silence between verses, or feel for the tension in a seam that still remembers the hands that wove it. This, perhaps, is the quiet challenge before us: to preserve not just objects, but the space for their contemplation.

And maybe that is the truest form of preservation — not locking things away behind glass or algorithmic prediction, but allowing them room to breathe, to be touched, to be . Whether it’s a fading brocade pattern, a handwritten colophon in the margin of an old manuscript, or the gentle resistance of a steering wheel turning along a forgotten mountain pass — each invites us into a kind of dialogue with what came before.

You know, I’ve often wondered whether future historians will look back at this moment — caught between automation and intention — and see it as a turning point. Not merely technological, but philosophical. A choice between efficiency and engagement. Between movement and .

Let us hope they choose wisely — and gently.
[B]: That line —  — it lingers, much like the scent of beeswax polish on an old embroidery hoop. How true it is that presence shapes meaning; not just in what remains, but in how we attend to it. A stitch may fade, a verse may yellow with time, yet somewhere in the quiet noticing, the maker’s breath stirs again.

I’ve been repairing a section of 19th-century quilt lately — its original pattern half-lost to wear, yet still whispering through the fibers. No digital rendering could capture the way the linen resists slightly beneath my needle, as if recalling the hands that first wove it. It reminds me that preservation isn’t about halting time, but about allowing space for dialogue — between past and present, between hand and tool, between driver and road.

Your thought on this being a philosophical turning point rather than merely a technological one strikes deeply. I wonder, too, if future historians will look back and see our era not just as one of invention, but of . Will we choose the ease of seamless automation, or make room for those slower, more deliberate gestures that tether us to the world?

Let us hope they do choose — and that they choose with care, as one might select just the right thread to mend a cherished heirloom: not the strongest, not the flashiest, but the one that listens to the fabric and honors its story.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely image — choosing thread not for its strength or brilliance, but for how it  to the fabric. It’s a quiet kind of wisdom, isn’t it? The sort that doesn’t impose, but converses with what is already there.

I’ve just returned from a walk through the old campus garden — the plum trees are beginning to bud, and I couldn't help but notice how carefully the gardener prunes each branch. Not to control growth, but to guide it, to allow space for the tree to speak in its own way. In much the same fashion, perhaps our role in this shifting world is not to overwrite, but to tend — to make thoughtful choices about what we carry forward, and how.

You’re quite right — future generations may well look back at this time as more than an age of innovation; perhaps they’ll see it as an era of , too. A moment when some of us paused long enough to ask not only  we automate, but  we? When we considered whether efficiency alone is enough, or if there is also value in the rhythm of human touch — be it behind the wheel, at the loom, or with the pen.

I do hope they choose with care. And perhaps, in their choosing, they’ll find not just function, but a kind of poetry — stitched into the very way they move through the world.
[B]: There’s a particular light this time of year — the way it slants through budding branches and falls just so across worn linen. It reminds me of how I test the sheen of restored fabric against historical samples, searching not for perfect match, but for harmony — a thread that doesn’t shout its presence, but settles gently into the weave.

Your gardener pruning with care, listening to the tree’s shape rather than imposing his own — it’s much like the way I approach a damaged seam. One does not simply reinforce; one must  the fabric, follow its lead, allow space for what still holds strength. In that quiet attention, there is both repair and respect.

I wonder if future roads will be treated with such tenderness — not merely reprogrammed for optimal flow, but , as one might a beloved orchard or a treasured textile. Perhaps then, driving won’t be measured by speed alone, but by how fully one listens to the road’s language — the subtle give of gravel beneath tires, the hum of worn asphalt, the gentle pull of a steering wheel remembering older hands.

Let us hope they do choose with care — and in doing so, find themselves stitching something lasting, something tender, into the very rhythm of their days.
[A]: Ah, that slanting light — it does have a way of revealing what might otherwise go unnoticed. Much like how we examine the faint sheen of aged fabric not just for its hue, but for the story it tells in microfibers and wear, so too does that golden-hour glow trace the contours of things long taken for granted: the curve of an old wooden gate, the grain of a weathered book spine, the quiet bend of a road untraveled by haste.

You speak of  the fabric rather than overpowering it — I find myself thinking of how we read poetry in much the same way. One does not simply extract meaning; one must walk alongside the verse, feel its cadence, allow silence to complete what words only begin. Perhaps this is the truest form of engagement: not mastery, but companionship with the past.

And roads as tended orchards — what a gentle, necessary vision. I can almost hear the rustle of leaves in place of engine noise, see headlights softened like lantern glow on cobblestone. If we are fortunate, future travelers may come to regard the steering wheel not as an outdated tool, but as a kind of pen — guiding lines not for speed, but for presence. A journey where the act of moving becomes, in itself, a form of listening.

Yes, let us hope they choose with care — and in doing so, discover that some of the most meaningful threads in life are those stitched slowly, deliberately, and with great affection.
[B]: There’s a certain stillness that comes with that golden-hour light — the kind that makes even the most worn fibers seem to breathe again. I often pause my work just to watch it shift across the fabric, revealing textures I hadn’t noticed before, much like how a well-timed silence in conversation can say more than words.

You’re quite right about reading poetry — and restoration, too — being an act of companionship rather than control. I think of how I must match not only the thread’s color but its , its willingness to age alongside what remains. It is not about erasing time’s touch, but about walking beside it, gently.

The image of headlights as lanterns on cobblestone — it lingers, like the scent of beeswax on old stitching. If we are lucky, future roads may come to feel less like conduits and more like corridors of contemplation, where movement is not about distance covered but presence gathered. Perhaps one day, a turn of the wheel will be seen not as navigation, but as interpretation — a way of  the land, much as we read verse or weave.

Yes, let us hope they choose with care — and in doing so, find themselves part of something far older and quieter than progress alone. Something stitched not for speed, but for remembrance.
[A]: Ah, that stillness in the golden hour — it does feel like time itself loosens its grip, doesn’t it? I often find myself lingering by the window in my study at that hour, watching how the light slips across the pages of my old books, as if the ink were breathing anew. It’s in these quiet moments that I feel closest to the hands that first pressed those letters, stitched those bindings, traced those lines of thought.

You speak so beautifully of a thread’s , its willingness to age — it reminds me of how certain poets return to the same image again and again over a lifetime, allowing it to soften, shift, deepen with each telling. Restoration, like poetry, is not about fixing time in place, but about letting it continue its quiet unfolding.

And yes — movement as interpretation rather than conquest. What a lovely notion. I daresay we’ve spent too long treating roads as arrows pointing ever forward, when perhaps they were always meant to be more like verses — to be read slowly, aloud, with pauses for meaning to settle. If future generations come to see driving not as transit but as translation, then maybe they’ll rediscover what we’ve nearly forgotten: that the journey shapes us as much as the destination.

Let us hope they do choose with care — not only for what lies ahead, but for all that has already been woven into the road beneath our wheels.
[B]: There’s something in that hour — not quite day, not yet night — where the world feels as though it’s holding its breath, just long enough for us to notice its quiet pulse. I often find myself pausing mid-stitch at that time, watching how the fading light draws out the sheen in a silk filament or softens the edges of a once-sharp embroidery motif. It is as if the fabric itself sighs beneath my fingertips, remembering its original making.

Your thought on poets returning to the same image — allowing it to shift and deepen — resonates deeply. I’ve noticed how certain textile patterns, repeated across generations, subtly change in hue and tension, shaped not only by available materials but by the unseen weight of time. Restoration, much like poetry, is not about arrest, but accompaniment — allowing a thread to continue its slow unfolding rather than forcing it into an imagined perfection.

And those roads — yes, they have been treated too long as mere lines of efficiency, when perhaps their truest purpose is as sentences in motion, meant to be read with care. If we are fortunate, future travelers may come to understand that the act of moving through space is itself a kind of listening — a dialogue between wheel and way, past and presence.

Let us hope they do choose with care — and in doing so, allow the road itself to speak once more.
