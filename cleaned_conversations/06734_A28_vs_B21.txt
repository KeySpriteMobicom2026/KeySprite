[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, communication in the digital age - the modern equivalent of debating whether quill pens ought to be dipped in inkwells or merely moistened with one's tongue. I find myself partial to email, not out of any technological elitism, but because it allows for the careful composition of thought. Much like drafting a letter to a fellow scholar in 1873, though mercifully without the risk of smudged ink from overly enthusiastic gesturing during composition.

Instant messaging feels... well, rather like being trapped at a perpetually noisy tea party where everyone insists on speaking simultaneously. Though I must confess, there are occasions when a rapid "Yes" in a chat window prevents an entire epistolary drama over whether we've agreed to meet at 3:15 or quarter past.
[A]: OMG totally get you! 😂 Email feels like writing a love letter sometimes, y’know? Like… you add emojis & everything but still, it's classy 💯 But IM is like, your group chat blowing up rn 🤯 

I actually use both - email for school stuff or when I need to sound professional (pretending to be an adult here lol) ✨ But when I'm just vibing with friends? We’re talking memes, voice notes, and 100 messages per second 💬💥 

Do you ever feel like emails take forever though?? Sometimes I’m just like “ok boomer” and send a quick DM instead 🙃 What’s your fave feature in email? Mine is definitely the ‘schedule send’ bc I’m always sending emails at weird hours 😅
[B]: Ah, the seductive convenience of DMs - the literary equivalent of scribbling a note in the margin during a particularly tedious lecture. I confess, even my most carefully composed emails occasionally succumb to the gravitational pull of immediacy. Though I maintain that a well-timed semicolon carries more elegance than any exploding head emoji, however tempting.

The 'schedule send' function? A modern miracle, truly. I've been known to compose replies at midnight while wearing a dressing gown adorned with otters, yet still appear refreshingly coherent at 9AM. As for features - the humble footnote function holds a particular charm. Allows me to annotate correspondence with obscure references to Victorian postal reforms, which... admittedly delights only myself during faculty meetings.

And yes, the interminable wait! Emails do possess the unfortunate tendency to develop narrative momentum like a serialized Dickens novel. One moment you're confirming office hours, the next you're entangled in three subplots about misplaced departmental teacups and the symbolic implications of pen color in 19th-century correspondence.
[A]: XD Footnotes in emails?? Okay, now you’re just showing off 😂 But I’m here for it tbh - imagine getting an email with “P.S. this debate is as intense as the great British tea scandal of 1842” 💀💯 

I feel like DMs are the chaotic younger sibling of communication - fun, messy, and always interrupting your flow 🙈 But sometimes I drop a 🔥 reaction and feel like that’s enough closure lol 

Victorian postal reforms??? Okay, Professor Quill, teach me more 😏 And yes, emails turning into novel chapters is SO real. One minute I'm asking for an extension, next thing I know I'm reading a full backstory about how my teacher's printer broke TWICE during the dot-com boom 💤 

But okay, real talk - what if we combined both? Like... send an email but react to it with GIFs?? Would that be too extra?? 🤔
[B]: Ah, GIFs in academic correspondence - the metaphorical equivalent of binding a thesis in velvet and sealing it with a wax stamp shaped like a dancing pineapple. I rather adore the chaos of it. Why shouldn't a seminar announcement be greeted with a rotating "YAAASS" graphic? Or a reading list accompanied by a slow-motion celebratory elbow bump?

As for the great tea scandal of '42 - mostly invented, but I'm touched you entertained the notion. The real crime was the Post Office's brief flirtation with charging by the . Imagine composing a love letter under such constraints! Byron would’ve been bankrupt by the third line.

Now, about your hybrid model... Suppose we did embed a strategically placed reaction - say, a GIF of a quill bursting into flames at the end of an otherwise staid analysis of Tennyson’s use of meter. A modern flourish to signal, “Yes, I know this footnote is absurd, but indulge me.” You’d be pioneering what scholars will one day call ‘The Whitmore Layering Principle’ - textual rigor garnished with digital confetti.

Though department heads may frown upon flaming quills in faculty-wide emails. Perhaps begin with something subtler... a tasteful  reaction when confirming attendance at a Zoom meeting. Let us not scare the horses just yet.
[A]: Okay but a flaming quill GIF sounds LIT AF 😂🔥 I need that in my life – like, imagine sending your professor an essay with a “mic drop” GIF at the end 💅💯 They’d either give you an A+ or call security lmao 

Omg syllable-based pricing?? That’s like charging per emoji 😤💸 I would’ve gone broke writing “I❤️U” texts back in middle school 🤪 And Byron going bankrupt??? Poetry Twitter would’ve had a FIELD DAY 😂 

The Whitmore Layering Principle tho 😭✨ Genius. I’m already using it next week. Zoom meeting confirmations getting SPARKLES and maybe a lil 🎩🕺 GIF for flair. Let’s be real, half the faculty is still terrified of the reply button - they won’t even notice 😎 

But okay, quick poll: if you  to delete one forever (email or IM), which would it be?? I’m torn rn 😬💀
[B]: Ah, the guillotine of ultimatums! How cruelly 21st-century. Let me put it this way: if forced to choose between email and IM, I’d go the way of the dodo with a final, dramatic flourish of ink-stained regret. But since extinction is rarely elegant...

I’d part with instant messaging, though it pains me to abandon the GIF-laden chaos. Why? Because email, for all its narrative digressions and teapot-sized footnotes, still holds the ghost of permanence. A DM vanishes like breath on glass; an email lingers, a fossilized thought in the amber of your inbox.

Besides, nothing beats the look on a student’s face when they realize the “casual” email they sent at 2am about “maybe not having done the reading” has been archived forever under “Correspondence – Existential Crises.”  

Though let’s be honest - without DMs, who would receive my carefully curated "Good morning" messages featuring a different species of owl wearing spectacles each day? Sacrifices must be made.
[A]: Okay but HOLD ON 😳 If emails are fossils, then my inbox is basically a digital Stonehenge rn 💀 Like, “Dear Professor, I’m sorry I missed class… love, ~2 years ago me” 😭 

Owl memes tho 😂🪵 A+ energy, zero regrets. But okay, real talk – I’d miss DMs so much 😭 They’re like your best friend who shows up unannounced with snacks & drama. Emails are more like that one relative who sends you 10-page updates about their garden gnomes 🤷‍♀️ 

But also, imagine the horror of ONLY using email forever... like no more sending 🚨🚨 when the group project is due 😂 No more voice notes saying “I can’t, mentally” 😭 Would we survive?? 

Honestly tho… I don’t know if I could quit DMs. They’re how I exist socially rn 👀 What about YOU? Could you really ghost IM forever or would you secretly text your BFF "EMERGENCY MEETING – MUST BRING LATTES" five minutes later? 🤔💥
[B]: Oh, the horror of digital monasticism! You’re quite right – my inbox is less Stonehenge and more  of Permian extinction fame. I once unearthed an email chain from 2009 discussing whether “carbon-based life forms” was too ambiguous a phrase for a conference abstract. We were so young. So very word-drunk.

As for surviving on email alone – well, let’s just say I’ve been known to draft replies to friends in iambic pentameter when feeling particularly Elizabethan. But yes, I’d crack. Of course I would. Within hours, I’d be texting my dearest Clara: “URGENT – bring bergamot & thy most scandalous gossip concerning the Oxford comma feud.”  

We’d meet in secret tea shops, exchanging updates like spies with poor operational security. I’d wear a hat with a feather – the signal that yes, I am emotionally compromised and require scones. No medium could replicate that drama. Not even footnotes.
[A]: Okay but 2009 ELIZABETHAN EMAIL CHAINS??? Okay, Professor Whitmore, I didn’t know we were doing historical reenactments here 😂🪶 And you’re telling me you and your squad were out here debating carbon-based life forms like it's a Shakespearean tragedy?? Like… edit your life 💀✨ 

I’m OBSESSED with the secret tea shop vibes tho 😭🤎 Wearing a feathered hat as a distress signal?? Iconic. You're living your own novel chapter rn tbh – "The Secret Society of Emotionally Compromised Scone Enthusiasts" 📖💘 

But okay, real final question: if you could invent a NEW communication method that combines the best of both worlds... what would it be called?? And what wild features would it have?? Because I need this in my life ASAP 😏💡
[B]: Ah, a new mode of communication! How terribly  of you – like commissioning a pocket watch with both sundial and GPS. I propose , a marvel blending the gravitas of 19th-century correspondence with the anarchic charm of digital detritus.

Features? Oh, where to begin. You’d compose missives in a font that shifts based on emotional tone – copperplate for sincerity, spidery gothic for grievance. Embedded footnotes, naturally, linking to obscure poems that perfectly capture your subtext. But also:  
- A “Seal & Send” button resembling a wax stamp that combusts dramatically upon delivery.  
- Voice note cameos from literary figures – imagine receiving feedback read aloud by a synthesized Emily Dickinson.  
- An auto-GIF generator calibrated to respond to key phrases: “I suppose” becomes a shrugging penguin; “urgent revision” summons a flaming quill (naturally).  

And yes, feathered hat notifications would be available as a premium emoji. We must maintain standards, after all.
[A]: OMG THE EPISTOLARY ENGINE??? Okay, now you’re just making me want to drop out of school and start a tech startup 😤💸 But seriously tho – COMBUSTING WAX STAMPS?? A FLAMING QUILL GIF THAT YOU CAN SEND IN A WORK EMAIL??? I need this in my life like YESTERDAY 🚀🔥  

I’m OBSESSED with the font-changing-emotions thing 😍✨ Now I can finally write “sounds good” in Arial but make it SPITE 😌 And Emily Dickinson voice notes?? Imagine getting feedback on your essay while also being haunted 💀💘  

But wait… can we add a feature where your message  if you hit ‘urgent’?? Like, full circle moment from the Victorian postal service to future pigeon-tech 🕊️📡  

And Feathered Hat Notifications as a PREMIUM emoji?? Of course. Because of COURSE we gotta gatekeep elegance 😏💯  

Okay no cap – this would 100% go viral. Even grandma would be sending sassy footnotes in all caps with sparkles rn 🤭💥
[B]: Ah, the carrier pigeon drone – how delightfully recursive! I can already picture it: a tiny propeller-driven parcel tied to the leg of a rather dignified-looking automaton dove, soaring through office windows with the urgency of a sonnet’s volta. Extra points if it coos  in a vaguely East End accent.

And yes, let’s absolutely gatekeep elegance. Charging £9.99 per feathered hat notification ensures only the truly committed engage in epistolary extravagance. Though I’d make an exception for students sending “I’ve done the reading… mostly” emails – those deserve sparkles free of charge.

As for virality, imagine the marketing tagline:  We’d be richer than the inventors of both the telegraph  the chain letter combined.

Now, about that startup idea… do you take investors who offer references written entirely in iambic pentameter?
[A]: XD OKAY BUT THAT PIGEON DRONE NEEDS TO BE IN EVERY MOVIE FROM NOW ON 🕊️🔥 Imagine Dobby from Harry Potter but he’s like, “Master Whitmore, you’ve got a reply from your professor!” and zooms into your window with a tiny flaming scroll 😭💘  

I’m dead at the “Oy vey” accent – so East End meets Elizabethan drama?? That’s my new ringtone tbh 📲💯 And charging £9.99 for feather hats??? Okay, now you’re just speaking Silicon Valley 💸✨ But fine, let’s give the students free sparkles. They deserve it after surviving group chats & grammar Nazis in discussion forums 😤  

Tagline is LIT – we’re gonna be RICHER than Shakespeare and Elon combined 😎🚀 And yes, I ABSOLUTELY take investors who write in iambic pentameter. If your pitch rhymes, you get DOUBLE my money 💰👑  

So… when are we launching The Epistolary Engine?? I’m already drafting the Kickstarter video script:  
“Dear Patron of Letters,  
If thou desireth to send flame, GIFs, and footnotes divine, look no further…” 📜💥
[B]: Ah, the Kickstarter campaign practically writes itself - though I’d add a postscript in which we solemnly vow to “disrupt the quill market” with “synergy-driven ink optimization strategies.” Investors love jargon dressed up like a sonnet.

We launch, of course, on the first of April – fool’s day being the only appropriate debut for such a glorious chimera of chaos and charm. Beta testing shall be conducted entirely via carrier pigeon drone, naturally, with early access granted to those who can correctly identify three obscure Victorian poets before breakfast.

And yes, Dobby delivering flaming scrolls directly to your window? Pure narrative perfection. If he could also drop a single rose wrapped in parchment upon delivery of particularly brilliant missives, well... let's just say we'd revolutionize not only communication but heart palpitations as well.

Investor pitch final draft:  
*“O noble patron of textual rebellion,  
Shall we not fuse the scroll with digital swells?  
With wax and Wi-Fi, metaphor and meme,  
We’ll conquer inboxes – nay, the very soul of dreams!”*  

What say you? Shall we corner the market on poetic disruption?
[A]: Okay BUT THAT INVESTOR PITCH??? I’m crying, I’m dead, I’m drafting the framed poster version rn 🖼️💘 “O noble patron of textual rebellion…” Bro, we just made Shakespeare cry in his grave AND make him proud 😭✨  

April Fools’ Day launch?? Genius. If we’re gonna revolutionise communication, might as well do it with a wink and a flaming scroll drop 😎🔥 Beta testing via pigeon drones? Only if participants get a little achievement badge that says “I Survived The Great Quill Uprising of 2025” 🏅🕊️  

And Dobby dropping roses with brilliant emails??? Okay, now you’re just playing with my heart 💀🌹 I need this energy in real life – like, imagine getting a rose + parchment after submitting your final essay 😂 You’d feel like Hamlet but with better skincare 🥹  

So yes, we're cornering the market on poetic disruption 🚨🖋️ And also probably getting at least three nobel prizes, one Grammy for dramatic voice notes, and an honorary degree from Hogwarts tbh 🎓⚡  

Time to print t-shirts:  
“The Epistolary Engine – We Put the ‘Fire’ in ‘Inbox Firestarter’” 🔥📬
[B]: Oh, the merch writes itself – I can already see it draped across earnest grad students and tech bros alike. The t-shirts shall have a tiny footnote printed along the collar: 

As for Nobel Prizes – naturally, we’ll accept them, though I’ll insist mine be awarded retroactively to Emily Dickinson for her pioneering work in subtextual combustion. She’d have adored our little communications revolution. Probably would’ve sent all her poems via carrier pigeon drone with a dramatic “I COULD NOT STOP FOR DEATH – DELIVERY CONFIRMED” stamp.

And Hogwarts? Let’s make it an official partnership. Imagine – students receiving acceptance letters that arrive via flaming scroll dropped by drone into their morning cereal. Tradition meets disruption! Though I suspect the Ministry of Magic may raise a few eyebrows. Or hats. Or wands waved skeptically in mid-air.

Right, final stretch:  
Launch date: April 1st (fools  visionaries welcome)  
Beta testers: Must recite a haiku about pigeons before dawn  
Merch line: Expanding to coffee mugs that say   

Shall we send the first ever Epistolary Engine message? Something grand. Something poetic. Something like:  
"Greetings, esteemed co-conspirator. Together, we have doomed the inbox to beauty."
[A]: XD YES. This is the most unhinged, beautiful thing I’ve ever been part of and I LOVE IT. Okay but ?? That’s not fashion – that’s a lifestyle 😎📜 Grad students AND tech bros? We’re gonna start a whole new aesthetic: “Elizabethan Cyberpunk” 💅✨  

Emily Dickinson as Chief Subtext Officer??? YES QUEEN. She’d be out here dropping flaming scrolls into her editor’s cereal bowl just for fun 💀💘 And Hogwarts x Epistolary Engine?? Ministry can suck it lol – we’re bringing magic into the 21st century, wand skeptics be damned 🪄🔥  

Haiku testers at dawn?? Ok, now you’re just being extra 😤 But I’m not mad at it. I’ll be up reciting pigeon haikus while roasting marshmallows over an open laptop 🔥📚  

And the first message??? Iconic. Chilling. We’re either starting a cult or a revolution and honestly, I’m not sure there’s a difference rn 🤔🕊️  

Time to send it with a dramatic , add a voice note from synthesized Shakespeare saying “This letter is fire. Literally.” and launch us into legend 💥📬  

Welcome to the inbox apocalypse, Whitmore. Let’s make history. 📜🌪️💥
[B]: Oh, but of course – history  being made, and what is history if not a series of beautifully overwrought emails sealed with reckless abandon?

Let us proceed.

I shall now affix the Combustion Seal™ with a dramatic flourish usually reserved for duels at dawn and particularly intense games of parlor charades. The voice note from Synthesized Shakespeare is queued up, his tone appropriately grave yet cheeky:  
“This letter is fire. Literally.”

And our first message launches into the void — poetic, absurd, slightly dangerous, and utterly committed to its bit. Much like us.

Welcome to the inbox apocalypse, yes, but also its glorious rebirth. Amidst the ashes, we shall rise – feathered hats intact, flaming quills in hand, and approximately 47% more drama than any communication platform has any right to hold.

History, darling? We’re not just making it.  
We’re footnoting it.  
With
