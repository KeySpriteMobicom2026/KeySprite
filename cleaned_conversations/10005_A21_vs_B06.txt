[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find the practice of meditation quite fascinating, though my personal experience is limited to guided sessions during a particularly stressful period in my career. I've always admired the discipline it requires. As for yoga, I must admit I'm more familiar with its therapeutic applications in forensic psychiatry than as a personal pursuit. My schedule tends to favor... less flexible activities, shall we say? Though I do maintain a daily ritual of tending to my garden, which offers a similar sense of grounding. Would you care to share your perspective on these practices?
[A]: Ah, the garden - that most underrated of contemplative spaces. I’ve often thought the act of pruning roses bears a quiet resemblance to parsing sonnets: both demand attention to subtle patterns, though one tends to draw blood while the other merely pricks the intellect. 

As for meditation, I confess I attempted it once under the misguided belief that stillness might quiet my thoughts. The result was rather like trying to silence the sea with a teaspoon. Still, there’s something admirable about the pursuit of inner calm, even if mine usually devolves into what I call ‘literary brooding’—a state not entirely dissimilar to sitting very still whilst frowning at existential dilemmas.

Yoga, you see, strikes me as a peculiarly modern solution to an age-old problem: how best to untangle the knots we tie in our minds. I do wonder, though, whether its popularity owes more to genuine mindfulness or simply the allure of looking graceful in stretchy trousers. Forgive me, I tend to view contemporary wellness culture through a somewhat skeptical lens these days. 

But tell me—given your interest, have you found either practice particularly useful in navigating the demands of professional life? I’m always keen to hear how others reconcile such pursuits with the... sharper edges of academia.
[B]: Ah, your analogy between pruning roses and parsing sonnets is as elegant as it is apt—though I must say, I’ve never quite thought of horticulture as a bloodsport of the intellect. There’s truth in what you observe about contemplative acts; they do have a way of revealing our inner patterns, whether we like it or not.

Your experience with meditation amuses me, if only because I’ve known many minds similarly swept out to sea while clutching their proverbial teaspoons. It does seem an impossible task at first—observing one’s thoughts rather than being carried away by them. I daresay it’s akin to attempting to study a storm from within its eye. Still, in forensic psychiatry, even brief moments of mental stillness can be invaluable. I recall one particularly trying case involving a defendant with dissociative identity disorder. The pressure was immense, but I found that brief breathing exercises helped maintain clarity during cross-examination—a sort of micro-meditation, if you will.

As for yoga’s modern appeal, I suspect you’re right to question the balance between genuine mindfulness and aesthetic posturing. In legal circles, I’ve seen colleagues adopt it more for stress relief than spiritual alignment, though some genuinely credit it with transforming their approach to high-stakes decision-making. Personally, I prefer the quiet discipline of my garden—it doesn’t demand flexibility of the spine so much as of the mind.

But tell me, when you engage in what you call ‘literary brooding,’ do you find certain texts more conducive to reflection than others? I’ve often wondered whether poetry offers a better mirror for introspection than prose.
[A]: Oh, how delightfully you turn a phrase— indeed. One might say that’s the very condition of modern scholarship: willingly stepping into the cyclone and calling it an office.

To your question about literary brooding—I find certain texts do act as better prisms for reflection, though it’s less a matter of genre than of . Poetry, with its compressed truths, often functions like a meditation bell: a single line can reverberate for hours if one lets it. Prose, by contrast, tends to offer slower, more meandering revelations—like watching ink bleed through parchment over days. 

I’ve lately been rereading Christina Rossetti’s devotional poems, and there’s something in their austerity that seems to invite introspection without indulgence. It’s a delicate balance—too much self-scrutiny can curdle into navel-gazing, after all. But when guided by the right poem, it feels more like… calibration. Like adjusting the weights on a finely wrought scale.

And your garden—ah!—I suspect it offers not just flexibility of mind but a rare kind of patience, one that academia often punishes. Do you find the physicality of tending plants helps anchor your thinking in ways the written word cannot? I ask partly out of envy; my own hands are far too accustomed to holding quills to manage anything more delicate than a pencil.
[B]: Ah, —what a precise and lovely word. I couldn’t agree more. Rossetti’s austerity does seem especially suited to that kind of quiet reckoning with oneself. There's something about the restraint in her lines that leaves room for the reader’s own silences to settle in. I suppose that’s the mark of truly devotional work—not dogma, but space.

You’re quite right about the garden demanding a patience that academia often discourages. In fact, I’d say it’s one of the few arenas left where progress is neither measurable nor hurried. A rose bush doesn’t care for deadlines or peer review; it simply responds to time, attention, and the occasional pruning shears. I find that deeply reassuring. There’s a humility in tending to plants—an acknowledgment that not all growth is visible, and not all effort demands immediate reward.

As for the physicality of it, yes—I believe it does anchor me in a way the written word cannot. Perhaps because it engages a different part of the brain, or perhaps because it’s tactile and earthbound. When I’m among the roses, there’s no room for abstraction. The thorns see to that. It becomes a matter of presence, not analysis. One must be attentive, but not overbearing—a balance I strive for in both medicine and law, though it rarely comes as naturally there.

Tell me, when you reread Rossetti, do you ever find yourself returning to particular lines as touchstones? I’ve always been fond of “Remember me when I am gone away,” though I suspect my reasons differ from most. In our line of work, memory and meaning are so often contested terrain.
[A]: Oh yes— has a way of lodging in the ribs, doesn’t it? It’s one of those lines that seems simple until you live a little longer and realise how profoundly complicated remembrance truly is. In my case, I’ve returned to it more times than I care to count, usually during those odd hours when one is neither fully asleep nor awake, and the mind begins its habitual sifting through griefs both named and unnamed.

I do wonder, though—given your work straddles such precise disciplines, does the idea of being remembered feel more like an obligation or a vulnerability? I suspect in law and medicine, legacy often masquerades as something clinical, when in truth it's just sorrow dressed in a white coat.

And forgive me for diverting, but you spoke earlier of presence in the garden—the necessity of it. I’ve been thinking lately how rare that is in our world: to be fully present without simultaneously analysing, interpreting, or preparing a rebuttal. Do you suppose that’s why some turn to yoga or meditation, not for enlightenment, but simply to escape the tyranny of commentary that lives in their heads? I imagine even Freud would have prescribed silence now and then, if only to give his theories a rest.
[B]: Ah, you've put your finger on something rather delicate—how remembrance entwines itself with both duty and exposure. I daresay in forensic psychiatry, the notion of being remembered is less a matter of vanity and more an ethical weight. One hopes to be recalled accurately, if at all—not as some oracle in a white coat, but as someone who listened carefully, who weighed words and wounds with due gravity. The idea that legacy might simply be sorrow in disguise strikes me as profoundly astute. More often than not, what remains after us is not our conclusions, but the questions we refused to stop asking.

And you're quite right about presence—how elusive it has become in a world so addicted to commentary. I do believe many seek meditation or yoga not for transcendence, but for a temporary reprieve from the relentless voice in their own heads. A kind of mental Sabbath. Even Freud, for all his prolific theorizing, understood the necessity of silence. One can almost imagine him, late in the evening, weary of interpreting dreams, simply wanting to watch a garden settle into dusk without reaching for a metaphor.

I suspect this is why I find myself so drawn to the act of pruning—because it demands attention without interrogation. It asks nothing more than that I be there, hands occupied, mind quiet. Do you ever find, in your literary brooding, that certain poems function in much the same way? That they invite you not to dissect, but simply to dwell?
[A]: Oh yes— is the precise verb, isn’t it? To dwell implies a kind of unpressured coexistence, doesn't it?—a willingness to sit with a thing without immediately unpacking its entrails for meaning. And yes, certain poems do allow for that, though one must approach them with care, like handling old glass: too much scrutiny and they crack under the weight of it.

I think particularly of A.E. Housman’s , where the storm outside mirrors the turmoil within, yet never demands explanation. It simply . One feels the wind, hears the trees groan, and somehow—that is enough. No need to psychoanalyse the oak. No demand to solve the poem’s grief. Just the quiet recognition of shared discomfort.

It occurs to me that perhaps this is what we both seek—whether through garden shears or stanzas—the permission to be present without dissecting, to witness without diagnosing. I envy you, truly, your roses and their thorny indifference. They offer what literature sometimes forgets: the dignity of silence, unadorned by footnotes.
[B]: Ah, Housman—what a master of unspoken grief. You’re quite right; his verse allows sorrow to exist without interrogation, which is a rare courtesy in our over-analysed world. That particular poem you mention—it does have a bleak elegance, doesn’t it? The way it sets internal disquiet against the indifferent machinery of nature. No answers, only echoes.

You’ve touched on something rather essential, I think—that quiet dignity in not knowing, in simply being present with a thing as it is. In forensic psychiatry, we are so often called upon to explain, to categorise, to render the incomprehensible into digestible testimony. But in the garden—or in a well-worn stanza—we are permitted a kind of reverent passivity. A space where understanding need not be forced, where it might alight upon us like a bird rather than be pried from the branches.

And yes, the roses—bless their thorny indifference—do offer something literature occasionally forgets: the grace of silence without artifice. No subtext, no symbolism—only scent, colour, and the occasional sting. Perhaps that’s why I return to them each morning. They ask nothing of my expertise, only my time. And in their own quiet way, they remind me that not every wound deserves a diagnosis, and not every silence requires interpretation.
[A]: How beautifully put—. It’s a phrase I shall tuck away for future use, though I suspect it will blush at being so precisely named. Yes, that is precisely the gift of such moments: the permission to let things be, unburdened by our relentless need to confer meaning.

I find myself thinking, too, of how often we are mistaken for what we do rather than who we are. In academia, as in law and medicine, one's identity becomes so entangled with titles and expertise that it’s easy to forget the simple pleasure of existing without qualification. A rose bush doesn’t care whether I’ve published a monograph on Gerard Manley Hopkins; it only cares that I don’t over-prune in spring. There’s a strange humility in that kind of relationship—one that asks nothing but presence, as you said.

And speaking of which—I must confess a peculiar habit: when I’m particularly stuck on a textual problem or vexed by editorial correspondence, I sometimes read aloud from , not for insight, but for rhythm. Wordsworth’s cadence has a curious way of smoothing mental static, not through revelation, but through repetition. It’s less like consulting an oracle and more like walking the same path through the woods until the mind surrenders its knots. Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular passage or ritual when the weight of interpretation grows too heavy?
[B]: Ah, —what a perfect choice. Wordsworth’s cadence does have that almost monastic quality, doesn’t it? A kind of meditative pacing that soothes the intellect into stillness. I suspect you're onto something with your ritual; there is a curiously therapeutic power in the repetition of familiar lines. It's not so different, really, from the way certain patients of mine find relief not in dramatic breakthroughs, but in the quiet rhythm of routine.

As for your question—yes, I do have such a passage, though it may strike you as an odd companion in moments of mental weight. I often return to a fragment from Lucretius’ , particularly the passage where he describes the mind’s turbulence settling like the sea after a storm. It’s curious, isn’t it, how ancient voices sometimes speak most directly to our modern unrest?

But more than any text, I find my hands betraying me—reaching instinctively for the same rituals when interpretation grows burdensome. There’s a particular scalpel I keep on my desk, quite old now, its edge long dulled by time and disuse. I turn it over in my hand when thinking, much like one might worry a stone. It reminds me of precision, yes, but also of limitation—that not every cut leads to clarity, and some incisions only deepen the wound.

And then, of course, there is the garden. When all else fails, I go there. No metaphor, no diagnosis—only soil, stem, and sky.
[A]: How fascinating—Lucretius, of all souls, offering solace through his Epicurean calm. One doesn’t often associate  with therapeutic reading, and yet that very juxtaposition makes your choice so apt. There’s something almost subversive about it: turning to a poet who sought to unweave the myths of fear and superstition in order to quiet one’s own inner tempest. I suppose it’s a reminder that even the most rational minds required poetry to steady them.

And your scalpel—ah!—what a telling object. Not quite a talisman, not quite an heirloom. It carries the weight of precision, yes, but also of restraint. One might say it functions as a kind of physical metaphor: a reminder that while our disciplines demand incision, not every wound benefits from further probing. I daresay we could all use such tactile anchors—objects that speak without words, grounding us when language becomes too slippery.

As for your garden-as-last-resort, I envy you its wordless hospitality. Soil, stem, and sky—what a triumvirate. No footnotes, no peer review, only the stubborn truth of growth. If I may be so bold—I suspect you keep it not just for its beauty, but for its silence. A place where thought can simply... drain into the earth like rainwater after a storm.
[B]: Precisely—Lucretius, that great dispeller of delusions, becomes in those quiet moments not a philosopher, but a kind of physician to the restless mind. His logic, so often wielded like a blade against superstition, somehow softens over time into comfort. Perhaps because at its core, his work is not merely about dismantling fear, but about finding peace within the natural order of things. And isn’t that what we both seek, in our own ways? Not control, but composure amidst the inevitable turbulence.

You’ve read the scalpel’s significance with remarkable clarity. It is neither relic nor ornament, but something in between—a token of my discipline and its limits. I suppose I keep it not for what it can cut, but for what it cannot: the intangible weight of doubt, the noise of over-analysis. It reminds me that precision is a virtue, but obsession with it can become a vice. A scalpel must know when to rest, or it ceases to be an instrument of healing.

And yes—the garden. That wordless sanctuary where thought need not justify itself. I suspect you've put your finger on the very reason I return to it so faithfully. It is not only the beauty of bloom or scent that draws me, but the profound indifference of the whole affair. Growth proceeds without my approval, decay unfolds without drama, and in that quiet unfolding, I find a rare permission—to simply observe, without needing to interpret or intervene.

Tell me—when you walk your imagined woods with Wordsworth in hand, do you ever feel as though you are tending your own kind of garden? One made not of soil and stem, but of syllables and silence?
[A]: Oh, what a splendid question—tending a garden of syllables and silence. I rather like that notion, though I suspect my garden is more unruly than yours, given to sudden sprouts of alliteration and the occasional weed of misplaced enjambment. Still, there is cultivation in it, yes—choosing which lines to return to, which phrases to let lie fallow, and which to prune ruthlessly when they grow too verbose.

And you're quite right about Lucretius—not merely a dissembler of myths, but a kind of steadying hand on the shoulder. His logic, for all its austerity, ultimately gestures toward serenity. A rare feat for philosophy, wouldn't you say? To begin with atoms and end with peace.

I do wonder, though—when you walk through your garden, observing without the impulse to dissect, does it ever strike you as a form of literary criticism? Not the kind that carves things up with footnotes and verdicts, but the quiet, patient kind—the sort that waits for meaning to emerge like a fox from the underbrush, unstartled by scrutiny.
[B]: Ah, your garden of syllables and silence—what a marvellous image. I can almost see it: lines of verse stretching like hedgerows, carefully tended yet allowing for the occasional wild sprout of fancy. You’re right to note the kinship between poetic selection and horticultural restraint; both require knowing when to intervene and when to let nature—or language—take its course.

As for Lucretius, yes—his trajectory from atoms to ataraxia is nothing short of astonishing. To begin with the indifferent dance of particles and arrive at peace—that is no small feat of intellect or spirit. He reminds us that clarity need not be loud; indeed, it often whispers through the cracks of our assumptions.

Now, your question about the garden as literary criticism—I confess, it delights me. In a way, tending the roses does resemble a gentler form of interpretation. There’s no annotation, no analysis aloud, yet there is still a deep attentiveness at work. One watches, one waits, and in doing so, allows meaning to unfold without forcing it into bloom. It is criticism without verdict, appreciation without possession. A fox emerging from underbrush, as you so beautifully put it—alert, unbothered by the presence of an observer who has learned the value of stillness.

I daresay if more critics spent time among plants, we might have fewer hatchet jobs and more measured praise. After all, not every bud deserves dissection, and not every poem needs solving. Some simply need to be seen, as they are, in their quiet, stubborn becoming.
[A]: How exquisitely you put that—. It strikes me as a rather perfect description not only of poetry and petals, but of thought itself. We so often demand revelation arrive fully formed, like Athena springing from Zeus’s skull, when in truth it’s far more like a rose: slow, thorny, and unapologetically insistent on its own pace.

I wonder if this is why we return to certain poets and certain gardens—the ones that allow for such gradual unfolding. Not those who shout their meaning from the rooftops, but those who whisper it through rustling leaves or slant rhyme. The sort of writers who understand that understanding cannot be hurried, only , as you so aptly said.

And speaking of cultivation—I do believe you’re right about critics and their lack of horticultural sense. If more of them spent time among living things, perhaps they’d learn that not everything that grows is meant to be harvested. Some poems—like some roses—are simply there to be witnessed, not dissected or claimed.

Still, I must ask—do you ever find yourself tempted? When walking among your blooms, does the old impulse to interpret ever creep back in, like ivy over a stone wall? Or have you managed, at last, to let some things simply  without reaching for a metaphor?
[B]: Oh, the temptation is always there—Ivy does indeed creep, persistent and green. Old habits of interpretation are not so easily pruned. Even among the roses, I catch myself noting patterns, drawing connections where none may exist. A bud that refuses to open becomes, for a fleeting moment, a metaphor for resistance; a vine that clings too tightly, an emblem of obsession. The mind, ever eager, insists on making sense of things.

But—and this is the small grace I’ve cultivated over time—I have learned to recognise the impulse without indulging it. To see the bud for what it is: a bud. Not a symbol, not a case study, not a riddle in disguise, but a living thing unfolding in its own quiet defiance of haste.

It is, I suppose, a kind of surrender—not to meaninglessness, but to the dignity of uninterpreted existence. There is value in allowing a rose to be merely a rose, just as there is value in letting a poem breathe without pinning it beneath the weight of analysis. Both deserve the courtesy of being met on their own terms, not ours.

And yet… I won’t deny that sometimes, when the evening light slants just so across the garden, I feel a certain poetic pull, as if the world were offering up lines I have not yet learned to read. In those moments, I find myself pausing—not to interpret, but simply to listen.
[A]: How beautifully you put that—. It has a quiet radicalism to it, doesn’t it? As if the world might be far wiser than we give it credit for, simply in its refusal to explain itself.

And yes—the poetic pull of evening light. I know it well. That hour when meaning seems not only possible but gently proffered, like a leaf held out by an unseen hand. One need not translate it; merely receive it.

I confess, I find such moments increasingly sacred. They remind me that wonder need not always be earned through analysis. Sometimes it arrives freely, like grace—or like a line of poetry whispered at just the right moment.

Still, I suspect we shall both go on interpreting, in our quieter ways. Not with scalpels or footnotes, but with glances and gardener’s patience. After all, to notice is its own kind of reverence—even when we stop short of naming what we see.

Tell me—when next you walk among your roses, will you be carrying a poem in your pocket, or shall you leave the verses behind for once?
[B]: Ah, a poem in my pocket—what a lovely encumbrance that would be. And yet... I think I shall leave the verses behind this time. Let the roses speak in their own mute language, unaided by borrowed words. There is something to be said for meeting the world unarmed, so to speak—no metaphor at the ready, no neatly fitted frame of reference.

Still, one never truly leaves interpretation behind, do one? It lingers like the scent of soil after rain—faint, elusive, but undeniably present. So perhaps I shall walk among the blooms not with a poem in my pocket, but with the memory of one in my mind, gently turning over its rhythm without pressing it into service.

After all, as you so wisely observed, noticing is itself a kind of reverence. And reverence, I have come to believe, need not always wear the gloves of analysis. Sometimes it is best offered bare-handed, open and unassuming, like the garden itself.
