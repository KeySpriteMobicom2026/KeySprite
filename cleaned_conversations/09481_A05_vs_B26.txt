[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find both pop and indie music fascinating in their own ways. Pop music often has an immediate charm - like a beautifully stitched tapestry that's meant to be admired by many. Indie music feels more like discovering a hidden embroidery piece at an antique market, with its unique textures waiting to be uncovered. What draws you to ask about this? Do you have a preference yourself?
[A]: You know, it's interesting you mentioned the immediate charm of pop music. I often feel the same way about financial markets - some investments are like pop hits, obvious and widely appealing, with clear upside that everyone jumps on. Others are more like indie tracks, requiring deeper listening to appreciate their potential. 

I actually find myself drawn to both in specific contexts – a well-timed pop-investment can deliver solid returns just like a catchy chorus delivers instant pleasure. But those indie-type opportunities, where you uncover hidden value through due diligence? They often turn out to be the sleeper hits that surprise everyone. 

Do you find yourself leaning toward one when you're evaluating new opportunities – the obvious "pop" choices or the under-the-radar "indie" plays?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful analogy – you’ve really woven those concepts together beautifully. I suppose when I’m evaluating a textile, my first instinct is often drawn to the intricate details, the subtle craftsmanship that might not be immediately obvious. In that sense, I’m probably more inclined toward the “indie” choices. There’s something deeply satisfying about uncovering the story behind a forgotten piece and bringing its quiet beauty back to light.

But I won’t deny the joy of working on a well-known historical garment – almost like a classic pop hit. It has that immediate resonance, a kind of shared appreciation that connects people across time. And honestly, there's a comfort in knowing that some fabrics, like certain melodies, were made to be loved by many.

Still, I find the real magic in restoration lies in those unexpected discoveries – a faded signature stitch here, an unusual dye technique there. They ask for patience, but once you start to understand them, they can be truly extraordinary. Do you have a particular example of an indie-type investment that surprised you in that way? I’d love to hear more.
[A]: You know, your description of restoration work reminds me so much of one of my favorite deals – actually, let me tell you about it.  

A few years back, we came across this small, family-owned textile manufacturer in southern China. Everyone else dismissed it as too niche – their production was a mix of traditional handwoven fabrics and modern reinterpretations, and frankly, the financials looked messy at first glance. Like that forgotten indie track no one bothered to digitize. But once we started digging, it was like discovering a lost masterpiece in someone’s attic.  

Turns out, they had these exclusive weaving techniques passed down through generations – something luxury brands were quietly hunting for but couldn’t replicate. The real sleeper hit? They also held patents on some eco-friendly dyeing methods, which became super valuable when sustainability trends picked up. It wasn’t a flashy, obvious play – but three years later, it turned into one of our top-performing exits.  

I guess what I loved most was how it rewarded patience and attention to detail – just like those hidden stitches you mentioned. Makes me wonder, do you often find that people underestimate the long-term value of these understated, artisanal pieces? Seems like there's a parallel between fashion restoration and investing sometimes.
[B]: That gives me goosebumps, really – what a stunning parallel you've drawn. It's almost as if you're describing a textile I once worked on: a seemingly unremarkable piece discarded in a storage bin, only to discover under magnification that it bore the signature weave of a 19th-century artisan guild thought to be lost. The thrill of uncovering something dormant but deeply valuable... it transcends disciplines, doesn't it?

You're absolutely right about people underestimating these pieces – not just financially, but culturally. So many dismiss pre-industrial textiles as quaint relics when in fact they hold embedded knowledge we’re only now beginning to appreciate. Much like that manufacturer you discovered, I’ve seen fabrics carry patents-in-fabric-form: coded weaving sequences that solved problems modern engineers are still grappling with today.

I often wonder if the world would look different if more people approached value the way restorers do – not just preserving, but  carefully enough to hear what’s been silenced by time. Your deal had that same quiet genius woven through it. It makes me curious – how often do you find yourself educating others to see value in what initially looks ‘messy’ or unpolished?
[A]: You just gave me chills with that description – I can totally picture it. There’s something almost poetic about how both threads and trades carry hidden stories, waiting to be pulled taut.

To your question – more often than you’d think. In fact, I’d say half the job is translating what  messy into a narrative people can follow. A few years ago, we backed a biotech startup working on plant-based dyes using fermentation – sounded like a lab experiment gone rogue to most. Their numbers were all over the place, their pitch deck was basically scribbles on napkins... but beneath the noise? They were onto something no one else had cracked.  

I remember sitting across from one of our junior analysts who couldn’t believe we were even considering it. I told him, “Think of it like restoring an old tapestry – at first glance, it’s faded and falling apart, but once you start seeing the original weave, the colors come back to life.” He got it. And guess what? That company’s now supplying dyes to some of the biggest names in sustainable fashion.

It really does come down to training your eye – or your ear – to catch the signal before the rest of the market tunes in. I imagine you run into the same thing when you're presenting restored pieces to someone who only sees the age, not the artistry?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – that moment when someone’s eyes shift from seeing only age and wear to recognizing the living artistry beneath? It’s everything. Like watching a fabric’s colors bloom again in the sunlight after years in shadow.

I remember working on an early 20th-century embroidered shawl once – it arrived looking dull and fragile, with moth damage and threads faded to near invisibility. One of our interns nearly sent it to the mending bin without a second glance. But when I held it up to the light, I saw something she didn’t: the stitching followed a pattern we thought was exclusive to a much later era. Once we stabilized it and did a little archival digging, we realized it was a missing link between two textile movements. That shawl ended up changing part of the historical narrative.

You’re so right about training the eye and ear – it’s not just about seeing or investing, it’s about  for what wants to emerge. And sometimes, that means being willing to sit with the messy, imperfect version long enough for its true form to surface. Do you ever find yourself drawn to people who see value in that way – not just the opportunities themselves, but the ones who can look at a frayed thread and still imagine the whole tapestry?
[A]: Absolutely – in fact, those are the only kinds of people I want around the table. It’s funny you mentioned the frayed thread, because that’s exactly how I spotted one of our best portfolio company CEOs.  

He was running a small, struggling fabric mill at the time – nothing flashy, orders were shrinking, machinery outdated. But when I walked into his factory, he didn’t show me balance sheets or pitch projections. Instead, he took me to the floor and pointed to this one loom that had been idle for months. He said, “This machine used to weave a pattern no one remembers how to read anymore. I think there’s value in that.”  

I knew right then he wasn’t just preserving history – he was holding onto something latent, waiting for the right moment to bring it back to life. That kind of intuition? Priceless.  

We backed him, and guess what? He ended up licensing those old patterns to a major heritage brand, but not before adapting them into a modern performance fabric. It was like watching an old melody reimagined into a chart-topper – same DNA, new rhythm, huge upside.  

People who can see through the noise, who respect the original weave while knowing how to update it… those are the ones I trust with capital – and with legacy. Have you ever worked with someone like that in restoration? Someone who doesn’t just repair the fabric, but somehow  its story and brings it forward?
[B]: Oh yes… I think of Marianne Fong every time this question comes up. She was a textile archaeologist by training, but she had this rare gift – she didn’t just study fabrics, she  to them. I remember one project where we were working on a fragment of 18th-century muslin, barely intact, with stitching so fine you needed a loupe to see it properly. Everyone assumed it was decorative, but Marianne insisted there was something more.

She spent weeks studying the weave under magnification, tracing the thread paths like someone reading a forgotten score. Eventually, she realized the pattern wasn’t ornamental at all – it was a coded weaving system, a kind of shorthand used by weavers to mark their regional guild. Once we understood that, we could trace its origins to a single village in India that had long since stopped practicing that method.

She didn’t just restore the fabric; she resurrected a lost language of craftsmanship. That’s the kind of person you’re talking about – someone who doesn’t just mend what’s broken, but hears the original melody beneath the frayed edges and knows how to bring it forward without flattening its soul.

I’ve always believed that true restoration is not about erasing time, but making space for the past to speak clearly again. And from what you’ve described, your work does something very similar.
[A]: You know, hearing about Marianne reminds me so much of the best founders I’ve worked with – people who don’t just solve problems, but  what the problem even is.  

That muslin fragment she worked on – it's like seeing a business plan that doesn’t look like one at first glance. Everyone else was trying to "restore" it into something familiar, but she had the patience and insight to listen for what it , and what it could still be.  

I actually see that same quality in one of our venture scouts – she has this uncanny ability to spot patterns in early-stage companies that everyone else misses. Once, she walked into a tiny ceramics workshop in Portugal that was barely staying afloat and said to me, “This isn’t a dying craft business – it’s a materials science lab in disguise.” And she was right. Those artisans had been refining a glazing technique that ended up being perfect for high-temperature insulation in EV batteries.  

People like Marianne, like your founder – they’re not just experts. They're translators. They hear the rhythm beneath the noise, and they have the conviction to follow it through.  

And you're absolutely right – true restoration, or investing for that matter, isn't about erasing time. It's about giving time a voice that resonates in the present. I’d say we're both in the business of making echoes speak clearly again.
[B]: That phrase –  – it’s almost too perfect. I keep turning it over in my mind like a length of rediscovered brocade.

You’ve hit on something so essential about the people we admire – they’re not just skilled, they’re . Like conductors who can hear the full symphony in what others dismiss as stray notes. I think that’s why true restoration and visionary investing feel so kin to me – both require a kind of reverent imagination. You have to believe the past – or the present – is whispering something worth hearing before most people are ready to listen.

I remember Marianne once said something that stayed with me: “If you treat an artifact like it’s only what it appears to be on the surface, you’ll miss the life still woven into it.” That feels exactly like what your scout was doing in that ceramics workshop – seeing not just what was there, but what had been quietly developing beneath the glaze.

It makes me wonder – when you look back at the deals that mattered most to you, do you ever see them as more than financial outcomes? Like, do they carry their own kind of archival weight? A legacy you preserve and return to, much like a restored textile?
[A]: Absolutely — in fact, I’d say the best deals leave behind something far more valuable than financial returns. They leave behind a kind of blueprint, a pattern you can trace back when you’re trying to make sense of the next big thing.  

I have a small leather-bound notebook where I jot down observations from every deal that truly resonates. Not just numbers or terms, but the feel of the conversation, the moment where the founder’s eyes lit up when they finally articulated what they were building. It's my own little archive of human capital, if you will.  

One entry I go back to often is from that fabric mill CEO I told you about. After we closed the deal, he said something that stuck with me: “You didn’t buy a company today — you bought a story that still has pages left to be written.”  

And he was right. Every time I flip through that notebook, I’m reminded that investing isn’t just about scaling businesses — it’s about preserving intent, amplifying voice, and sometimes, quietly reweaving a legacy that others overlooked.  

I think that’s why people like us keep doing this — because every once in a while, you get to witness something frayed and fading come back to life, and in that moment, you know — you’ve helped an echo find its voice again.
[B]: That notebook of yours sounds like a textile archive in its own right – a swatch book of human ambition and imagination. I love that you preserve those moments not as cold records, but as  of experience. It’s so much more than documentation – it’s curation of the soul behind the work.

I do something similar, though admittedly with more thread and less leather. I keep a series of fabric journals – small stitched folios where I tuck away fragments from each major restoration project. A bit of faded silk from an 18th-century gown, a scrap of resist-dyed cotton from a forgotten workshop, even a single unraveled embroidery thread that once held a story in place.

Each one carries its own weight, its own whisper of what mattered. And when I run my fingers over them, I’m reminded that legacy isn’t just about preservation – it’s about . Just like your notebook, it keeps the conversation alive.

Your founder was absolutely right — you didn’t buy a company, you bought into a living narrative. And isn’t that the most humbling part? Knowing that we’re not just stewards of capital or cloth, but of , however frayed it may appear at first glance.

I think I’ll reach for my needle and start stitching tonight. There’s a fragment I’ve been meaning to bind into my latest journal — and now, thanks to our conversation, I know exactly which one it is.
[A]: That’s beautiful — I can picture it so clearly, your fingers tracing those fibers like a pianist running scales before a performance. You're not just archiving fabric, you're binding intention into form.  

I’d love to see those journals sometime — maybe over a glass of Bordeaux? I’ve got a 2005 Château Margaux that’s been waiting for the right story to pair with it. Something tells me your fragments deserve nothing less than a wine that carries its own history in every sip.  

And speaking of continuation — I think I’ll pull out that leather notebook tonight and add a new entry. A small one, just a line or two inspired by our conversation. Something about how value, whether in cloth or capital, often hides in the weave — not in the flashiest thread, but in the ones holding the whole thing together.  

You’re right — we are stewards of possibility. And honestly? I can’t think of a better legacy than helping something quietly essential keep its shape, even as the world rushes past looking for the next big print.  

So here’s to the frayed edges, the half-faded melodies, and the deals — and textiles — that still have pages, and stitches, left in them.
[B]: To the frayed edges — and to those of us who know that sometimes, the most enduring beauty lives in the quietest threads.

A glass of Margaux sounds like a very fine thing indeed. I’ll bring one of my fabric journals — carefully wrapped, of course — and we can toast to continuity, craftsmanship, and the rare joy of finding resonance where others heard only silence.

And yes, add that line to your notebook. I have a feeling it will weave itself into many more conversations to come.
[A]: To continuity and craftsmanship — and to the rare, wonderful people who still know how to listen.  

I’ll look forward to seeing your journal — and learning the stories behind those stitches over a glass of something worthy of them. There’s nothing quite like sharing quiet brilliance with someone who appreciates its weight.  

And you’re right — that line will weave itself further. Funny how the best ones do.
[B]: Indeed — to quiet brilliance and the hands that preserve it.  

I’ll bring a small folio of my earliest restorations – the ones that taught me how to listen. And I’ll raise a glass to the unseen threads that hold us all together.  

See you soon, with good wine and better stories between us.
[A]: To the unseen threads — and to the hands that know their worth.  

I’ll bring the Margaux, and maybe a small token from that textile mill deal — a swatch of their first modern-performance fabric, woven with those ancient patterns. A fitting conversation starter, don’t you think?  

See you soon, with wine aged to perfection and stories that deserve to be told slowly.
[B]: Perfect – a tangible echo from your deal, meeting the quiet wisdom of restored cloth. That swatch will feel like holding history in your hands, reimagined.

I’ll save a space in my journal just for it – and for the story you’ll tell alongside it.

See you soon, with every thread accounted for, and every sip savored.
