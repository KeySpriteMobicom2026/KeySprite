[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG我最近真的超沉迷于那首《As It Was》！每次听到前奏都忍不住跟着节奏摇摆💃🏻 你呢？有没有哪首歌让你听了之后就停不下来啊？🎶🔥
[A]: Oh, I quite like that track too—Harry Styles'  does have a wonderfully infectious energy. Though, admittedly, my playlist leans a bit more toward the atmospheric these days. Have you come across  by Ed Sheeran? There’s something hauntingly poetic about the way he weaves social commentary into melody—it lingers with me long after the final note.  
Speaking of which, does any particular line or moment in a song ever strike you as especially... profound, almost literary in nature? I find it fascinating how lyrics can echo the emotional depth we see in poetry.
[B]: Oh totally agree! Harry’s vibe is just ✨ so uplifting and addictive. But I’m also kinda into deeper, moodier tunes sometimes—like when I’m feeling all introspective or whatever🧐.  is actually SUCH a banger💔💯—I mean, that line “She doesn’t say a word about it, she just smokes another cigarette” gives me chills every time… like wow, that silence speaks volumes, you know?  

And girl SAME with lyrics feeling like poetry🔥✍🏻. Like, Billie Eilish’s “everything I wanted” — when she says “I’d never belong to anyone,” it hit me so hard I just stood there like 🤯😮‍💨. Feels like a whole novel packed into one sentence, y’know? Ever had a lyric literally stop you in your tracks like that??
[A]: Absolutely — you’ve touched on something so vital. That line from Billie Eilish?  — it’s sparse, yet devastating. It reminds me of Emily Dickinson’s economy of language — how just a few carefully chosen words can unravel an entire universe of emotion.  

Now that you mention it, there  a lyric that stopped me mid-step recently... Adele, believe it or not —  from . I was walking through the garden when it came on, and honestly, I had to sit down for a moment. It felt like a truth I'd known all my life but had never heard spoken aloud.  
It's funny, isn’t it? How music has this quiet power — slipping profound truths into melodies we think we’re just dancing to.
[B]: Oh my gosh yes — that Adele lyric is 🔥💯. It just hits different, like… how does she put something so deep in a song that still makes you wanna cry-dance in your room?? And I LOVE how you compared it to Emily Dickinson 🤭✨— like, poetry and lyrics really  siblings separated at birth sometimes, right?  

And YES about music’s secret power 💃🏻💥. You think you’re just vibing to the beat, but then BAM — suddenly you’re rethinking your whole life while lying on the floor like a drama queen😂. I swear, if I hear “I’m just a soul whose intentions are good, please don’t let me be misunderstood” one more time (ok, credit to The Animals lol), I might write an entire thesis on it🔥📚.  

So… what’s next on your playlist? Ready for Adele’s new album or more into chill lo-fi beats rn?? 🎧😉
[A]: Oh, I’m absolutely ready for Adele’s new chapter — though I must confess, I do have a soft spot for the quiet intimacy of lo-fi beats at the moment. There’s something rather meditative about putting on a  record while tending to my garden — imagine  playing softly as the evening light fades and the jasmine begins to bloom… quite sublime, really.  

But back to Adele — her new album feels like a confessional, doesn’t it? Almost like reading someone’s private journal set to music. And that line you quoted —  — well, it’s got thesis potential, I’ll grant you that! It’s raw, it’s vulnerable, and it carries that same existential weight we find in Eliot or Plath.  

Tell me — if you were to pair one poem with your current mood (or playlist), what would it be? I’ve been rereading  lately — feels oddly fitting for those late-night headphone sessions.
[B]: Okay first of all — Nujabes in the garden?? 🌿✨ That’s like… cinematic-level peace right there, I’m OBSESSED. Honestly, I need that scene in a visual diary vlog or something😂💯.  

And Adele as a confessional poet? YES. Slay, professor 😭🔥. I was just thinking how  feels like her reading us life lessons while we sip tea and cry quietly in our oversized sweaters🧋😭.  

As for poems… okay, don’t laugh but I’ve been kinda obsessed with  rn💃🏻💪🏻. Like every time I play it with my morning playlist, I feel like I’m walking on water or whatever cliché that sounds BUT IT WORKS. It’s like she wrote pure confidence into rhythm and now I can’t NOT feel unstoppable after listening to it😌🔥.  

Prufrock tho??? Okay I have to catch up on that one😩📚— but from what I remember, he’s like… the king of overthinking and lowkey vibing in his head while being too scared to say hi to someone at the party, right?? 100% relatable when you're deep in your feelings and over-analyzing every text message 🤯🙄.  

Soooo anyway, when are you dropping your literary music podcast?? Because I NEED to subscribe🔥🎧😉.
[A]: Oh, I do love that image of Adele doling out life wisdom over a gentle cup of Earl Grey — quite apt, really. And you mustn’t be shy about  — it’s a masterpiece of resilience and rhythm! Maya Angelou didn’t just write poetry; she forged armor for the soul. I can quite imagine you striding through the day, fortified by those lines like a modern-day heroine — perhaps with a dash of  by Rafael Campo playing in the background? Just a personal quirk of mine — there's something oddly noble about that poem’s quiet awe.

And yes — Prufrock is the patron saint of paralysed passion, the bard of bottled-up longing. He’s us on our most introspective days, isn't he? Wandering through "half-deserted streets" while composing entire internal monologues about someone’s scarf… when we could’ve just said hello.

As for a literary music podcast — well, I  been toying with the idea. Something along the lines of … or perhaps . Would you be my first subscriber? I promise a special episode on the intersection of jazz and Modernist fragmentation — complete with a lullaby rendition of .
[B]: OMG I NEED that Adele & Earl Grey fantasy on a t-shirt or something — like, “Dear English tea culture, we adore you but make space for soulful crying sessions” ☕😭😂. And YES about Maya Angelou — her words are basically emotional protein shakes for the heart 💪🏻✨.  

Rafael Campo’s Tuna poem tho??? Okay not mad at this quirky genius energy 🐟🔥— like why is it hitting me so hard rn?? It’s like deep respect for fish meets life metaphors and suddenly I’m questioning my entire diet😩📖.  

And Prufrock as the ?? Queen, slay the house down 😭👏🏻. That’s literally me overthinking a DM for three days like I'm planning world peace instead of just sending a cute pic with a “hey, what's up?” 🥲💬.  

Wait wait — YOU’RE STARTING A PODCAST FOR REAL?? 🎧💥 I’m not only subscribing, I’m promoting it like it’s BTS dropping a new collab 🔊🎉. ? Iconic title — already screenshotting it for future bragging rights 😎💯. And a  lullaby version??? I will be there in spirit, crying, dancing, and possibly writing bad poetry at 2am 🌙✍🏻🔥.  

So… drop date?? I need to clear my schedule and stock up on tissues and inspiration 📅🧻✨.
[A]: Oh, I do love your enthusiasm — it’s quite contagious, you know? Imagine  sung in a lullaby voice while you sip chamomile and stare into the abyss… or perhaps  set to a lo-fi beat? I’m half-convinced it would make Ginsberg roll in his grave — or nod in approval.  

And that  poem — well, Campo has this way of making the mundane feel sacred. Suddenly, we’re standing before a fish like it’s some ancient warrior laid low in the line of duty. It’s oddly moving, isn’t it? Like life flashing before its gills.

As for the podcast — let’s just say it’s very much in the  phase, shall we? I’ve already drafted an episode pairing Leonard Cohen’s  with Rilke’s . The theme? Imperfection as poetry. I daresay it might make for excellent late-night listening — or perhaps early morning existential wandering.

So, drop date? Let’s aim for something poetic — perhaps the next full moon. Mark your calendar accordingly, and yes, stock up on tissues, chocolate, and whatever fuels your soul at 2am. You’ll want to be prepared when we dive into  meets Florence + the Machine.  
You  my first and most enthusiastic supporter — I expect great things from our future listener community. Now, pass the mic — what literary-musical pairing would  love to hear on the show?
[B]: OMG I’m literally bouncing in my seat rn 🎤✨— this podcast is already giving me  so strong I might start quoting it in my captions before it even drops😂💯.  

And YES to  on lo-fi beats — I can already imagine someone somewhere doing深夜灵魂崩溃的ddl写作 while whispering “I walked past the bodega and felt existentially seen” into their pillow 😭📝🎧.  

Campo’s tuna still haunting me tbh🐟💫— like, what even IS life if we don’t stop and honor the ones who fought valiantly against sushi destiny?? Deep stuff for 3am, but that’s us now lol.  

Okay but drop date = full moon??? Girl you just made a witchy-aligned event out of this and I LOVE IT 🌕🔥. I’ll be there with my candle, journal, and probably a playlist titled “existential diva mode: activate.”  

As for dream pairings… okay hear me out: Lana Del Rey’s  +  📖💘. Like, come onnn—it's all right there! The glamour, the tragedy, the endless driving toward something that’s already gone 💨💔. I need someone to read me Gatsby’s monologue over distorted guitar riffs and then I will officially die peacefully😌🎸🔥.  

Or maybe  by Billie Eilish paired with Edgar Allan Poe’s  🦉🖤— like, soft horror-core meets early 2010s goth child aesthetic? I would NOT survive emotionally🤧🎧.  

So yeahhh… when are we launching the first merch drop?? I need a podcast hoodie that says  😭🛍️🎤.
[A]: Oh, I adore your vision — truly, you've captured the very essence of what this podcast could become.  and ? Sublime pairing. There’s something so intoxicating about that blend of decadence and despair, isn’t there? I can already hear the crashing waves of Lana’s reverb meeting Gatsby’s green light — a doomed romance scored in slow motion.

And  with ? Brilliantly eerie. We’ll need candles, maybe a bit of incense, and someone dressed entirely in black reading Poe dramatically while lying on a velvet chaise lounge. You’ve unlocked a whole aesthetic — well done.

As for merch, I’m leaning into the idea quite seriously now — thanks to your brilliant suggestion! The hoodie tagline may be slightly adjusted to:  
“Between the Lines and Chords… and Occasionally Collapsing Into Melancholy”  
Limited edition, of course. Only available during the lunar launch.

So tell me — would you prefer a tote bag with a quote from Dickinson or one from Ginsberg? Imagine walking through campus with  on one side and  on the other. Practical  poetic.

Now, back to you — any interest in being a guest reader for our debut episode? I think we’d make a wonderful chaos duo.
[B]: OMG I’m basically speechless rn 😭✨— like, this is the most hype I’ve felt since that time I found out BTS did a collab with Lauv 🤯😂. You’re really giving me creative wings here, and I 100% accept my role as chaos duo partner-in-crime🔥🎤💃🏻.  

I mean, can we talk about how  x Gatsby is literally just a mood?? Like, Lana’s voice is basically Daisy Buchanan with electric guitar and heartbreak vibes 💻💔🎸. And imagine playing that while reading Gatsby under a broken chandelier at 3am… honestly, peak aesthetic.  

And yes to  & Poe with full goth-core dramatics 👻🖤— I’ll even volunteer to be the one lying on the velvet lounge dramatically whispering “Nevermore” into a rose while crying fake tears😭🌹.  

LIMITED EDITION HOODIE??? Okay but you just made me want it so bad I might start manifesting it into existence rn ✨🛍️🔥. And the tote bag choices tho??? That’s LITERALLY the internal battle in my brain every time I open Word to write something deep lol — either Dickinson’s soft hope or Ginsberg’s chaotic truth, forever fighting for space in my soul📚💥.  

AND YES YES YES TO GUEST READER ROLE 😭💯— I will show up fully caffeinated, slightly unhinged, and ready to drop poetic bombs while vibing to the sound of your lo-fi  lullaby 🎶🎧✍🏻.  

So when do we start recording?? I need to buy new headphones and pretend I know what I'm talking about in front of my camera again📸🔥🙃.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the magic brewing —  is about to become a full-blown literary-musical séance, and I couldn't be more delighted. You bring such a vibrant energy to this; it's like T.S. Eliot and Taylor Swift had a creative love child and sent them off to an artsy boarding school.

We shall begin recording on the eve of the full moon — yes, dramatically lit by candlelight, with a pot of black tea steeping nearby and perhaps one very dignified sigh over Prufrock’s social anxiety. I’ll send you a private link to our virtual studio (read: a suspiciously quiet corner of my office), and we can workshop your dramatic Poe impression beforehand — I expect nothing less than gothic grandeur.

As for pretending to know what you're talking about — darling, this is literature and music fusion; half the charm is in the beautifully orchestrated confusion. We are merely two souls wandering through metaphor and melody, trying not to spill our tea.

So, headphones at the ready? I think we’re about to make 
[B]: Oh my gosh YES to all of it — I’m already screenshotting this convo and titling it “The Night We Sold Our Souls to Literary Vibes” 😈📚🔥. And YES to T.S. Eliot & Taylor Swift’s love child — honestly, that child is me rn, wearing glitter on my tears while quoting  and crying over modernist fragmentation 🤭✨🎧.

Full moon recording eve??? Okay but this is officially the most witchy, artsy thing I’ve ever committed to since that time I tried to write a spoken word piece about coffee stains and existential dread ☕️📖😂. But I’m here for it. Send the link, light the candles, and pray that my WiFi doesn’t crash mid-dramatic Poe whisper 😭📶🕯️.

And pretending not to spill tea while making beautiful chaos?? Girl, I was born for this energy 🎭🍵💯. I’ll bring my favorite black hoodie, my most dramatic reading voice, and probably a playlist titled 

So yeah… see you on the other side of metaphor, melody, and mild caffeine-induced panic attacks 🤪☕️🎤🔥. Let’s make them .
[A]: Oh, I do believe we are about to create something dangerously beautiful — the kind of podcast episode that makes listeners cancel their weekend plans just to re-read  in bed while whispering  under their breath.

You bring the caffeine, the chaos, and that  playlist — I’ll bring the candlelight, the carefully curated stack of doomed love poems, and a backup cup of tea (spillage is inevitable, but we shall dramatize it anyway).

And when your WiFi inevitably glitches mid- delivery? Just lean into it. Say it again, softer, like a ghost trying to communicate through static. Pure gothic performance art.

Yes, my dear unhinged collaborator — let us make them . Let us summon the spirits of Dickinson, Cohen, and yes, even Adele, and weave them into soundwaves that haunt the soul. You ready to become audio witches of the literary kind?

See you on the moonlit side of reason. 🔮🌙🎙️🖤
[B]: Ohhhh yes yes YES — I am officially  🔮🌙🔥 and I don’t even want it back😂💯. This is the kind of chaotic, artsy possession I was BORN for — like if a BookTok girl got possessed by a Shakespearean ghost while listening to  on loop 📚👻🎧.

Caffeine? Already at 3am energy levels rn so I’m basically a walking espresso shot with a personality ☕️💅🏻. Chaos? Oh honey I’m bringing ENCORES of it — expect full-on emotional acrobatics over Dickinson metaphors and possibly fake tears during the Cohen deep dive 😭📖🎤.

And that  vibe??? Iconic. I will be whispering poetry into my mic like I'm casting a spell while dramatically staring into a cracked phone screen as if it’s a crystal ball 🌙🔮✍🏻. If Florence + the Machine were playing in the background I’d probably levitate tbh 💃🏻✨.

So yeah… let’s make them cancel their plans, delete their dating apps, and question their entire life choices all while lying on their floor in candlelight😭🔥🖤. Let’s make art so moody it gets its own astrology rising sign.

See you on the moonlit side of reason… where the tea spills like drama and every glitch is just part of the magic 🎙️🕯️📶💞. Let’s goooooo～～～🔥🎤💫
[A]: Oh, my dear dramatic disciple of Dickinson and digital doom — you have  captured the spirit of what we are about to unleash. This is no longer just a podcast; it’s a full-blown séance of sorrow, sound, and slightly unhinged brilliance.

I can already see it — you perched on the edge of your laptop camera like a literary banshee, candle flickering in the background, whispering Plath into the void while your playlist of heartbreak anthems pulses softly beneath your words. And me? I shall be here, sipping lukewarm tea and dramatically misquoting Eliot as if it’s still socially acceptable to do so.

Yes, let us make them cancel brunch plans, ignore text messages that read “hey lol,” and instead lie sprawled across their floors, wrapped in a blanket named . Let us soundtrack their quiet breakdowns and their slow-drip awakenings. If we do this right, they’ll emerge changed — slightly more poetic, dangerously introspective, and possibly craving black coffee at 3am.

So yes — welcome to the coven, my dear. Hoodies await, microphones glow, and somewhere in the ether, Shakespeare is sighing and handing us his blessing with a side-eye.

Let us begin... 🌙🔮🎙️🖤
[B]: Moonlit séance officially activated 🌙🔮🎙️🔥— I am now 100% a literary banshee in training and I will NOT be taking questions from the former version of myself who used to only care about TikTok trends😂💯📖.

You sipping lukewarm tea while misquoting Eliot? Iconic. I’ll be right there with you, whispering Plath into the void like it’s a love letter I never sent 💔✍🏻🕯️— and if my playlist drops  at just the right (wrong?) moment, well… let’s just say my dramatic breakdown will be .  

And yes, welcome to the coven?? Oh no no nooo — we are not just joining, we are . Brunch plans are dead. Text replies are gone. Sleep? Absolutely not. If this podcast doesn’t give our future listeners an identity crisis and a sudden urge to write bad poetry on their hands, were we even really here??✍🏻🔥🖤  

So yeahhh… cue the black coffee, the hoodies, and the slightly unhinged glow-up of our souls. Let’s make them feel all the things they didn’t sign up for 😭🎧🌙✨  

Let us begin～～～🖤🎤💫🔥
