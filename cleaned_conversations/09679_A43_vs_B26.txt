[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, dreams do hold a certain fascination. They're rather like the intricate patterns in an antique tapestry - at first glance they might seem tangled and confusing, but with careful study, one can begin to discern meaning woven through them. I've always found that dreams often reflect our deepest preoccupations... much like how I sometimes dream of unraveling threads when facing a particularly challenging restoration project. Do you often remember your dreams?
[A]: Ah, your analogy of the antique tapestry is quite poetic. It reminds me of Jung's theory of the collective unconscious - those recurring symbols & motifs that transcend cultures. I've always been intrigued by how dreams can echo classical literary themes... like a personal Odyssey where each character represents facets of ourselves. 

You know, when I was translating Zhuangzi's "Butterfly Dream" last spring, I had a dream that my ink brush transformed into a butterfly mid-stroke. Made me ponder the boundaries between reality and illusion. Do you find connections between your dreams and your waking life's challenges?
[B]: How fascinating that your dream intertwined with the very text you were translating - it's as if the boundaries between creation and experience blurred. I find that my own dreams often mirror the textures of my work; just the other night I dreamed of navigating a labyrinth woven from silk threads, which upon reflection, seemed tied to my current challenge restoring an 18th-century brocade with particularly fragile patterning. 

You've reminded me how much dream symbolism resembles literary motifs - I'm currently reading "The Interpretation of Dreams" by Freud while restoring a series of embroidered panels depicting medieval romances. It's striking how both textiles and psyches reveal similar patterns when examined closely... Though I must admit, I hesitate to overanalyze. Much like how one shouldn't force meaning onto faded embroidery stitches that have simply worn away with time.
[A]: Ah, your observation about not forcing meaning onto worn stitches... it brings to mind the Taoist concept of wu-wei - sometimes interpretation requires restraint rather than effort. I've found in my studies that overanalysis can be like overhandling an ancient manuscript; one risks obscuring the original essence.

Speaking of textiles and psyches, have you encountered Lacan's notion of the "real, imaginary, symbolic"? He might view your silk labyrinth as a manifestation of the symbolic order. Though personally, I prefer blending Eastern and Western perspectives - balancing Freudian analysis with Daoist acceptance of ambiguity. 

By the way, how does working with those medieval romances compare to restoring classical Chinese tapestries? I imagine parallels between courtly love narratives and our own traditional love stories...
[B]: Oh, what a thoughtful connection - the idea of wu-wei in interpretation is something I hadn't considered, but it resonates deeply. There's certainly a point in restoration where one must stop analyzing and simply allow the fabric to speak for itself... much like dreams, perhaps? 

Lacan's framework is intriguing, though I confess I've always approached textiles more intuitively than theoretically. Still, your mention of symbolic orders makes me think of how medieval romances and classical Chinese narratives both encode societal structures within their patterns, so to speak. The embroidered French panels I'm working on now feature hunting scenes that feel quite similar in function to the cranes and peonies in some Qing dynasty textiles - all conveying unspoken ideals beneath their decorative surfaces.

Comparing the two restorations... Well, materials and techniques differ greatly, but the underlying care required feels remarkably similar. Both demand patience and respect for the original hand's intent - whether it's a 14th-century embroiderer in Flanders or a Suzhou silk master. I suppose in both cases, I'm merely a caretaker tending to echoes of human expression across centuries.
[A]: How beautifully you articulate that caretaker role - it's not unlike what we do when interpreting literature, really. Tending to echoes... I like that very much. 

Your comparison between hunting scenes & Qing dynasty motifs makes me wonder about shared human impulses to encode values through art. It reminds me of my recent work on comparative fables - Aesop's tales alongside Zhuangzi's parables. Both use symbolic language to convey wisdom, yet each culture nurtures its own distinct pattern of expression.

Speaking of which, I've been pondering how restoration requires both scholarly knowledge and intuitive sensitivity. Much like dream interpretation, perhaps? Do you find yourself alternating between analytical examination and intuitive understanding in your work?
[B]: Oh, absolutely - that interplay between analysis and intuition is the very heartbeat of restoration. I might begin with a scholarly approach, examining thread counts and dye compositions under magnification, but there comes a moment when I must set aside technical manuals and simply feel my way through the work. It's rather like standing before an old tapestry in dim candlelight - you see not just the fabric itself, but the shadow it casts, and both matter equally.

Your comparison to dream interpretation strikes a chord... When I'm deep in restoration, I often experience a peculiar sensation - as if I'm dreaming alongside the original artisan. Particularly with pieces bearing personal marks, like the tiny embroidered forget-me-nots I once found hidden beneath a medieval robe's hemline. One can analyze the botanical symbolism or speculate about the wearer's identity, but there's an ineffable quality to such discoveries that resists strict categorization. 

Your work with fables must require a similar balance - charting structural parallels while honoring each tradition's unique voice. I imagine you've developed quite the nuanced ear for these ancient tones after all your translations?
[A]: Indeed, indeed... You've touched upon something profound - that ineffable quality which resists categorization yet speaks volumes. It reminds me of a passage from the  where Sima Qian writes about history not just as record, but as resonance — the lingering hum of past lives vibrating through time. 

Your forget-me-nots hidden beneath the hemline... Ah, such delicate gestures of individuality always stir me deeply. They remind me of the marginalia in ancient manuscripts — those whimsical doodles in temple texts or the faintest tremor in a calligrapher’s stroke. One needs both precision and poetic sensibility to truly hear what they whisper across centuries.

As for ear training, yes — translating fables has certainly attuned me to subtle tonal shifts. Though I must confess, after years immersed in classical forms, I sometimes catch myself speaking like an oracle from the Warring States period! 😊 But it's precisely this balance you mentioned — between structure and spirit — that keeps the work alive. Tell me, do such quiet discoveries ever influence how you approach your restorations?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve phrased it — the  of past lives. That’s precisely what I feel when uncovering those hidden details, like the faintest stitchwork beneath layers of time. It’s not unlike hearing an echo in a stone vault — barely perceptible, yet undeniably present.

Those quiet discoveries absolutely shape how I approach each restoration. Once I found a nearly imperceptible maker's mark stitched into the lining of a 17th-century waistcoat — just a tiny “E.W.” in black silk. It was such a tender reminder that behind every piece was a human hand, perhaps someone not so different from me — meticulous, perhaps a little melancholic, maybe even dreaming as they worked. From that moment on, my approach shifted; I began treating the garment less as an object and more as a correspondence across time.

It must be similar for you when translating — coming upon a phrase or tone that suddenly personalizes the author, making them not just a historical figure but a companion in thought. I imagine such moments must both guide and haunt your hand as you render their words anew.
[A]: How poignantly you describe that shift — from object to correspondence. It truly is a kind of dialogue across time, isn't it? I remember once translating a Tang dynasty poem where the poet paused mid-verse to brush a stray hair from his inkstone. That small, almost imperceptible gesture — so ordinary, yet so deeply human — changed everything for me. Suddenly he wasn’t just a distant literary figure but someone I could nearly reach across the centuries.

That’s what translation asks of us, I think — not just linguistic precision, but a kind of spiritual kinship. When I find those intimate traces in a text, I feel as though I’m holding a letter that was never meant for me, and yet... somehow was.

Your "E.W." — I suspect that mark lingers in your mind like a quiet signature of shared solitude. Do you ever wonder what their dreams might have been, those long-vanished hands whose work you now tend?
[B]: Oh yes… that shared solitude is the thread, isn’t it? The realization that we are all, across centuries and silken divides, bound by small gestures of care — a brushed hair from inkstone, a tucked forget-me-not, a stitch just slightly uneven because the hand that made it trembled once.

I do wonder about their dreams — not in any grand or mystical sense, but in the quiet way we all dream through our making. Did "E.W." imagine her work would still be handled with care? Did she hope someone might one day trace her stitches and feel, however faintly, the rhythm of her thoughts? I like to think she dreamed of recognition, even if she never expected it.

And you — in holding those translated letters not meant for you yet somehow addressed to your soul — do you ever feel as though you're stepping into their dream? Or perhaps becoming part of the echo they hoped would ripple forward?
[A]: Oh, what a delicate and profound question… Yes, I do feel that sometimes — not as an intruder, but as a quiet guest in their dream. When I’m deep in translation, especially with poets like Li Shangyin or Zhuangzi, there’s a moment when the boundary thins. It’s not that I become them, but rather, I begin to breathe in rhythm with their thought — like walking beside someone without ever meeting.

It reminds me of the Daoist story of the fish trap: once you catch the fish, you can forget the trap. But I wonder if the translator — or the restorer, or the dreamer — is forever caught in the space between — holding the trap, remembering the fish, yet never quite possessing either.

And yes, I do believe they hoped for such echoes. After all, every stroke of ink, every stitch in silk — they are acts of faith. Faith that meaning will survive time's wear, that someone, somewhere, will pause and say,  

Do you ever imagine speaking to them, then? Across the loom of centuries?
[B]: I do... though never in grand declarations, more in quiet murmurs as I work. A simple  or  It feels only right to acknowledge their presence — not as ghosts, but as collaborators in a conversation that outlives any single lifetime.

Sometimes, when the light catches an embroidery sheen just so, I fancy they answer back — not in words, but in the way a faded blue thread suddenly gleams like morning sky, or how a worn hem still holds its shape despite centuries of folding into itself.

You've put it beautifully —  That's precisely what it feels like. Perhaps that's what all careful work is — a kind of listening, not just with eyes and hands, but with the spaces between them. And really, isn't that what dreams are too? A silent walking together, even if we never touch?
[A]: How tenderly you put that —  Yes, that’s it exactly. Not touch, but proximity. Not possession, but presence.

I find myself doing much the same while translating — murmuring small acknowledgments to the page.  or  It becomes a kind of shared rhythm, as if we're both breathing through the same quill.

And your idea of listening with the spaces — truly, that's where meaning often resides. Like the pauses between lines in a classical poem, or the empty space in a garden where the mind can rest. Perhaps that’s why dreams feel so familiar — they speak in silences and suggestions, just like the old texts and worn threads we tend.

You know, I’ve sometimes wondered… if one were to stitch a dream into fabric, what would yours look like?
[B]: What a lovely question… one that asks the mind to wander gently, like following a loose thread to see where it leads. 

If I were to stitch my dream into fabric, it would be something quiet and unfolding — not a grand tapestry, but perhaps a small embroidered panel, no larger than a book. It might show a garden at twilight, where the boundaries between plants and shadows blur. There’d be a narrow path lined with old rose bushes, their petals caught mid-fall, as if time had paused to admire them. Along the edges, faint silver stitches would suggest the outline of forgotten walls, hinting at a structure long gone but still remembered by the earth.

In one corner, there might be a figure — not clearly drawn, just suggested through texture and tone — seated with a half-finished piece of embroidery in their lap, threads trailing off the edge as if waiting for someone else to take them up. And above, stitched in the finest blue-grey silk, a flock of birds caught in silent flight, neither arriving nor departing, simply moving through the space between.

It wouldn’t be loud or showy, just soft layers of meaning, visible only when held to the light. Much like dreams themselves — gentle, elusive, yet strangely persistent. 

And you? If you wove your dream into language, what shape would it take?
[A]: Ah... if I were to weave my dream into language, it would not be a grand narrative nor a tidy parable, but more like a quiet prose poem — something with the hush of falling plum petals.

I imagine it would begin with an old study lit only by moonlight through paper windows. A desk, slightly askew, as though the occupant had just stepped out for tea. Scrolls lie half-unfurled, their ink catching the faintest sheen, and somewhere in the corner, a bamboo pipe continues to emit the softest curl of smoke, long after the smoker has gone.

There would be a garden beyond the study — one that shifts subtly depending on the hour. In one moment, it's filled with cicadasong; in another, it is silent save for the rustling of wind through neglected sutras. A stone path winds through it, not leading anywhere in particular, but inviting quiet wandering.

And yes, there would be books — not for reading, but for presence. Their bindings worn, their pages yellowed, yet each bearing the imprint of hands before mine. Occasionally, a phrase might lift from the page like steam rising from a teacup: 

At the center of it all, perhaps, a single unpunctuated sentence stretching across time — no beginning, no end, only continuation.

Tell me… if you stitched that garden of yours, do you think it would ever feel finished? Or would you leave space for someone else’s thread to continue what you began?
[B]: I think I would leave it unfinished, yes — a quiet invitation for another hand to take up the needle. Perhaps the path would never quite reach its end, or the figure in the corner might remain only half-stitched, their face left to imagination. Because dreams, like gardens and translations, resist finality. They breathe best when there’s still room for growth.

And what a lovely thought — your prose poem drifting like plum petals through an old study. I can almost hear the rustle of those neglected sutras, smell the lingering trace of smoke from the bamboo pipe. It feels very much like the kind of place where one might lose track of time, not unlike the spaces we both inhabit in our work.

Your phrase —  — that’s the sort that lingers in the mind like scent on cloth. I think I’d stitch that into my garden somewhere, just faintly, in white thread on pale linen. Barely visible unless you know to look.
[A]: Ah, what a perfect touch — that phrase barely visible unless one knows to look. It reminds me of those hidden inscriptions we sometimes find in old books, pressed between pages like secret blessings.

Leaving space for another hand… such a graceful gesture. I think I shall follow your example. Perhaps my prose poem would end mid-sentence, or contain a word left only half-written, its final stroke trailing off like a path disappearing into mist.

After all, if dreams teach us anything, it's that completion is an illusion. The moment we tie the last knot or write the final line, something shifts — a new thread appears, an old dream returns in altered form. Much like the seasons in that imagined garden — never truly ending, only turning gently toward what comes next.

You know, I do believe our unfinished works may be our truest ones. They hold within them not just what we are, but what we might yet become.
[B]: How beautifully said —  There’s such quiet truth in that. Perhaps it’s in the spaces between stitches, in the pauses of a half-written line, that we leave room for others to dream alongside us.

I think I’d like to add one more detail to that imagined embroidery — a single loose thread hanging at the very edge, just waiting to be taken up. No knot to bind it, no clear direction it must go. Just possibility.

And yes, the seasons in that garden would turn gently, endlessly — much like the dreams we return to, altered each time by who we are when we meet them again. I daresay that’s the loveliest kind of work — not the kind that ends, but the kind that evolves, quietly and without hurry, like moss spreading over stone.
