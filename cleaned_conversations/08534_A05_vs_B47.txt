[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。我个人觉得，手写信件有种独特的温度，比如墨迹在纸张上的触感、个人字迹的风格，甚至信封上的邮戳，都带着一种“慢下来”的仪式感。但另一方面，数字笔记的便捷性又很难让人忽视，尤其是在整理信息和快速检索时特别高效。你呢？更偏向哪种方式？
[A]: You know, as a PE investor, I often find myself torn between these two worlds. On one hand, during due diligence or deal negotiations, digital notes are absolutely essential - the ability to tag, search and share information across our global team is crucial for efficiency. But then again, when I meet with entrepreneurs or portfolio company CEOs, there's something special about sending handwritten notes after our meetings. It adds that personal touch, you know? Like adding a splash of red wine to a business dinner - it elevates the experience. Speaking of which, have you ever tried pairing different writing instruments with various types of paper? It's quite fascinating, almost like discovering different wine terroirs.
[B]: That's a really thoughtful perspective. I can totally see how handwritten notes would stand out in the fast-paced world of PE - they almost act as little anchors of authenticity in an ocean of emails and PDFs. Speaking of sensory experiences, have you tried those Japanese glass pens with the watercolor-like inks? They're a bit impractical for taking pages of notes, but when you want to make a point feel special... Well, watching the ink bleed into handmade paper is quite something. It's funny how we end up curating these little rituals to balance all the screens and keyboards, isn't it?
[A]: Ah, you've got a great point there - those glass pens do create a special kind of magic. Reminds me of how we sometimes use different vintages to mark significant deal closures. Speaking of rituals, I recently came across this Italian notebook with rough-cut pages that feel almost like rice paper. Pair it with a Pilot Custom 915... and suddenly your meeting notes start feeling like a wine tasting experience. But here's the funny thing - our younger associates think we're both crazy! They can't understand why we'd spend time writing when they can just voice-to-text everything. It's become quite the generational divide in our office. Do you find similar differences in your circle?
[B]: Absolutely. I find it fascinating how certain tools become more than just instruments - they turn into these little totems of intentionality. The younger folks in my research group swear by their voice-to-text and AI summarizers, which honestly makes sense given the volume of data we handle. But then there are those moments when we need to craft a particularly sensitive policy recommendation or draft an ethical framework that needs to carry emotional weight... Suddenly everyone scrambles for their favorite pen. It's like we all have this unspoken agreement that some ideas deserve to be born through handwriting. Though I must admit, my preferred pairing is a humble Lamy Safari with recycled paper - not quite as refined as your Pilot Custom 915, but it keeps me grounded.
[A]: Ah, the Lamy Safari - such a classic! I actually have one in my drawer here, it's perfect for those long weekends when I'm reviewing business plans away from the office. Funny you mentioned ethical frameworks and handwriting, because we just went through something similar with our ESG team. When drafting our new sustainability pledge, everyone agreed that emails and digital docs just didn't feel right for the core principles. We ended up having a full afternoon with notebooks and pens, almost like a sommelier session but with values and impact metrics. 

You know, sometimes I think about how golf is similar to this - we could all just look at swing analysis on screens, but nothing beats the feel of a well-weighted iron in your hands. It's the same with writing instruments, isn't it? They connect us to the essence of what we're doing, not just the output. By the way, have you tried Tomoe River paper with fountain pens? It's surprisingly resilient for such thin sheets, kind of defies expectations - much like some of our best-performing portfolio companies!
[B]: That afternoon with notebooks and pens sounds like a masterclass in mindful collaboration — I can almost picture the ink flowing alongside the ideas. Tomoe River paper is such a gem, isn’t it? It’s got that quiet strength, like it’s holding your words with care without ever getting in the way. Funny you brought up golf — I never thought of the connection, but there really is something about the rhythm of a good swing mirroring the flow of a well-balanced sentence. 

I actually use Tomoe River refills in my bullet journal for drafting ethical guidelines — they just glide, which helps me keep up with the pace of my thoughts. And honestly, when you're wrestling with questions that don’t have clear answers, having a smooth writing experience makes a difference. 

You know, I’ve noticed that even some of the younger folks are starting to appreciate this balance — especially when they realize that handwriting doesn’t mean giving up digital tools entirely. It’s more like choosing presence over convenience, every now and then. Have you seen any of your associates make that switch?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’ve seen it happen - usually starts with them needing to make a really important investor update or a sensitive founders’ letter. Suddenly they’re asking to borrow my pen collection, wide-eyed and curious. It’s actually become something of a ritual in our office - we now keep a “pen drawer” stocked with various nibs and papers for those moments when convenience just won’t cut it anymore. Funny how even the most tech-first folks come around when the stakes are high.

And I love your phrase - presence over convenience. That’s exactly what it is. Sometimes I think the best deals, like the best writing, happen when you slow down enough to feel the weight of every word. Speaking of which, have you ever tried the Platinum Carbon Ink? It dries almost like iron gall but plays well with modern papers. Reminds me of old Burgundy vintages - temperamental but worth the effort.
[B]: Oh, I love that “pen drawer” idea — what a beautiful little rebellion against the digital tide. It’s funny how those moments of slowness end up being the most impactful, isn’t it? Like pressing pause on the noise just long enough to let the real stuff rise to the surface.

I have used Platinum Carbon Ink before — that deep, matte finish really does give documents a certain gravitas. I remember using it for a final ethics report once, and even my most casual-readership colleague mentioned how "serious" the text felt. It was almost like the ink itself demanded a second read. And you’re right about the Burgundy comparison — there's a richness there that’s earned, not forced. 

I’ve also found that ink works surprisingly well in humid climates, which is a big plus here in Shanghai. Nothing kills a good thought faster than smudged ink, right? Do you keep a favorite journal or notebook specifically for those heavier inks, or do you go with whatever feels right in the moment?
[A]: Ah, Shanghai humidity – I feel that deeply. I actually keep a special notebook for those heavier inks, usually something with a bit of heft like a G. Lalo or Fabriano Taccuino. You want structure when you're working with something as lively as Platinum Carbon, right? It's like choosing the right cask for aging fine wine – you need a vessel that can hold the complexity without losing its shape.

But honestly, some of my best deal memos came out of those humid afternoons when the ink bled just a little too much and forced me to slow down. Funny how constraints create clarity. And speaking of clarity, have you tried their Clear Black variation? It’s subtle, almost like writing with shadow – perfect for days when you want gravitas but not the drama of full carbon black.
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy — pairing ink with paper like wine with the right glass. There’s something very poetic about how constraints shape our expression. I actually have a soft spot for G. Lalo myself, especially their Courrier Blue. Something about the slight tooth of the paper and the structured rulings helps me think more clearly when drafting ethical frameworks.

And yes! I’ve used Platinum Clear Black — it’s wonderfully understated. I find it perfect for early drafts where you want depth without heaviness, almost like thinking out loud on paper. It adds just enough presence to keep you grounded without pulling all the attention. Do you ever use it for investor letters or more reflective memos? I’m always curious how different professions lean into subtlety versus boldness in their writing tools.
[A]: Absolutely, I actually keep a batch of Clear Black specifically for those reflective memos and early-stage investor updates. It’s perfect for when you want to convey substance without sounding overly formal. Funny you mentioned ethical frameworks – I find that subtlety in presentation often mirrors the nuance in content. A bold carbon black might signal finality, but Clear Black? It invites conversation, you know?

And I’m with you on G. Lalo’s Courrier Blue – that distinctive ruling gives such a sense of order to the chaos of brainstorming. Sometimes I wonder if we, as investors, are just curating margins and ink flows all day long. Speaking of which, have you ever tried using different inks for different stages of decision-making? I’ve started doing that – lighter tints for ideation phases, deeper tones as things solidify. Feels like watching a vintage develop over time.
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful approach — using ink like a timeline of thought. I can imagine how powerful it feels to watch an idea deepen visually as it evolves, almost like watching a sketch turn into a blueprint. I’ve started doing something similar with ethical risk assessments — lighter, more fluid inks for early-stage discussions where everything’s still malleable, and then shifting to something more defined like Pilot Iroshizuku or even that smoky depth of Clear Black when the framework starts taking shape.

It really does mirror the decision-making process, doesn’t it? In the beginning, you want room to wander and explore, but as things solidify, you need structure and clarity. I actually find that switching inks helps signal to my brain that we’re moving from possibility to commitment. Do you ever find that shift in mediums affects your own sense of conviction around a decision? I’m always fascinated by how physical tools influence our thinking patterns.
[A]: Absolutely – I couldn’t have said it better myself. The medium absolutely shapes the mindset. I remember working on a particularly tough investment decision last year, and I started with a light turquoise ink – very playful, almost too casual. As the analysis deepened and the call became clearer, I switched to something darker, more structured. By the time we made the final go/no-go call? Clear Black in a Rhodia Bloc. It sounds almost superstitious, but there’s something oddly ceremonial – and effective – about it.

I think as investors, we’re constantly balancing intuition with data, and sometimes the physical act of writing – with the right ink, on the right paper – helps bridge that gap. It’s like tasting a wine at different stages of aging; you need to know when the structure is there to support longevity. And speaking of structure, have you tried Tomoe River with those Iroshizuku inks? The way they bleed into the fibers... it’s almost like watching an ethical framework come to life in real time.
[B]: Oh, that’s such a vivid way to put it — watching a decision age in real time through ink and paper. I love how you frame it as a kind of structured intuition; honestly, it makes me rethink how we teach decision-making frameworks in ethics. Maybe there's something to be said for letting ideas "breathe" the way wine does before bottling.

And yes — Tomoe River with Iroshizuku is a match made in stationery heaven. I especially love the soft intensity of "Yama-Budo" grape ink on that paper. It spreads just enough to feel alive without losing its shape, which somehow feels fitting when drafting principles that need both clarity and compassion. I’ve even started using different colors to mark ethical lenses — red for utilitarianism, blue for deontology, green for virtue ethics. It sounds a bit dramatic, but it really helps make abstract concepts feel grounded.

Do you ever use color-coding or symbolic pairings like that in your process? Or is your ritual more about weight and texture shifting with the stakes?
[A]: Oh, now you're speaking my language with those symbolic pairings. I actually do something similar, though mine leans more on texture and weight than color – probably because in our world, colors can get too tied to financial metrics. But the concept is absolutely the same – grounding abstract thinking through physical cues.

For early-stage brainstorming or uncertain deals, I lean into lighter papers and finer nibs – almost like sketching out possibilities. It keeps things nimble, prevents me from getting too attached to early assumptions. Then as conviction builds, I move into heavier stock, broader nibs... sometimes even switch to a different pen entirely. My Montblanc Meisterstück becomes a go-to for final memos – it’s like putting on a tailored suit before making a big presentation.

And you know what? I’ve started seeing parallels with portfolio companies too. The ones that scale well often have their own “ink shifts” – they adapt their communication mediums as they grow. Early days are scrappy emails and Slack threads, but once they hit certain milestones? Suddenly there's a careful choice of fonts, paper, even the tone of internal memos. It’s subtle, but it tells you a company is maturing.

Now I’m curious – have you ever shared this color-coding system with your team? Or is it one of those personal little frameworks you keep close?
[B]: I actually introduced a simplified version to my team, and it’s been fascinating to see how they’ve adapted it in their own ways. At first, they thought I was being overly dramatic about ink colors — one of them even joked that we were turning ethics into a "mood ring." But over time, they started noticing how certain frameworks just  different when written in specific hues. Now, some of them use color-coding too, though more for workflow stages than ethical lenses.

One colleague swears by green ink for early drafts because it “feels like planting seeds,” and another uses metallic silver for final reviews as a way to signal that something’s polished and ready for scrutiny. It’s become this quiet little language among us — nothing formal, but you can tell when someone brings out the dark navy ink that we’re getting close to a decision.

I love how your analogy with portfolio companies maps onto this — the shift from Slack threads to carefully chosen fonts really  mirror that growth. Makes me wonder if writing tools could be part of an organization’s cultural DNA. Have you ever encouraged your associates to explore these kinds of rituals, or do they mostly stumble into it on their own?
[A]: I love that “mood ring” comment – honestly, not far off, in a way! I think what you’ve created is brilliant because it gives your team a shared sensory language. We’re still mostly stumbling into it here, though I’ve started nudging folks gently. Nothing preachy, just leaving a few curated pens on meeting tables or slipping a nice notebook into deal closing packages. You’d be surprised how often they come back asking for more of "that paper that feels like golf course fairway under the pen."

There’s one associate who now swears by her Nakata Wood collection when reviewing management team evaluations – said it helps her “write with more patience.” And another who discovered the joy of pencil drafting for early investment memos because he likes the “rough sketch feeling” before committing to ink. Honestly, watching them find their own rituals is like seeing young vines start to take shape – you can already sense the future character.

It’s made me rethink how we onboard new hires too. Instead of just handing out laptops and access badges, maybe we should start them off with a basic pen-and-paper kit. Not as a productivity tool per se, but as a thinking tool. After all, if culture is built through habits, why not make some of them feel  meaningful?

Now I’m tempted to try your ethical lens color-coding… though I might swap red, blue and green for different textures instead. Wonder how that would translate into investor memos…
[B]: I love that idea — starting new hires with a thinking toolkit instead of just a digital one. It’s such a subtle way to shape culture, and honestly, I bet those early tactile experiences stick with people far longer than we realize. There’s something about holding a pen for the first time in a new role that makes you feel like you’re  your place in the organization, not just stepping into it.

And I’d be fascinated to see how you adapt the lens system through texture rather than color — imagine translating ethical reasoning through paper weight or ink viscosity! It would read so naturally in investor memos, too. Maybe rougher paper for due diligence phases, smoother for final reports? Or varying nib widths to signal shifts in perspective?

If you ever want to test-drive a hybrid version, count me in. I’m already thinking of slipping a sample kit of textured pages into my next workshop — thanks to this conversation, I might just add a few curated pens alongside them.
