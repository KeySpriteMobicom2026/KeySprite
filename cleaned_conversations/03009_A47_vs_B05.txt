[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: It's a really nuanced topic. On one hand, social media connects us & creates communities, but on the flip side, it can lead to comparison culture and anxiety. I've seen some interesting data around screen time ~ mental health correlation in Gen Z. What's your take?
[A]: Let me think... I'd say the impact varies a lot depending on usage patterns and individual psychology. Some people build supportive networks online, while others fall into the trap of endless comparison. The Gen Z data you mentioned actually makes sense considering they're digital natives - their social development is intertwined with online interactions. 

Have you looked into those longitudinal studies from University College London? They found that girls especially experience worse mental health outcomes with heavy social media use, but it's more about the quality of interaction than screen time itself. What do you think drives these negative outcomes - the platforms themselves or how we adapt to them?
[B]: That UCL research is spot on. The key driver? Let's break it down. Platforms are designed for engagement, not well-being. Infinite scroll & algorithmic feeds create dopamine-driven feedback loops. But here's the twist - we also need to look at cultural shifts. Gen Z curates personas while chasing "clout", creating cognitive dissonance between real self & digital avatar. 

Ever notice how even adults get anxious over LinkedIn metrics? We're seeing similar patterns in our portfolio companies' employee wellness programs. It's not just teenage girls - this affects professionals too. Would love to hear your perspective from the education angle, since you work with younger students. Have you seen these behavioral patterns emerging in high schoolers?
[A]: Absolutely, what you're seeing in professionals mirrors what's happening in high schools, just with different platforms and stakes. I’ve had students confide in me that their Instagram likes dictate how they feel about themselves . It’s not just vanity — it’s a real-time social validation system they didn’t ask to be part of, but can’t opt out of either.

One thing I’ve noticed is how filtered reality affects their perception of normalcy. They see curated highlight reels and compare it to their everyday unedited lives. And because everything feels public, even private moments are measured through a performative lens. A simple hangout with friends becomes a content planning session.

You mentioned LinkedIn anxiety — honestly, I see the same pressure in teens, just on TikTok or Snapchat. The "authentic self" is getting harder to define when your identity is partly shaped by engagement metrics. What’s fascinating is how some kids are starting to push back — like intentionally posting low-effort content or going silent for days as a kind of rebellion. Have you seen anything like that in the companies you work with?
[B]: Interesting observation. In our portfolio companies, we're seeing a similar pushback, but framed differently. Some professionals are adopting "digital minimalism" — limiting social media exposure to protect mental bandwidth. Others are creating "authenticity bubbles" within company culture, encouraging vulnerability in safe spaces.

The rebellion you described among teens feels like a generational response to performative pressure. I've noticed some of our younger associates doing the same — posting memes about burnout or sarcastic comments about hustle culture. It's their way of saying, "I'm more than my KPIs."

What intrigues me is how this tension plays out in long-term career trajectories. Are we heading toward a future where mental resilience & digital literacy become core skills taught alongside math and science? Have you seen schools adapting curriculum to address this?
[A]: Definitely — and I think schools are starting to realize that digital literacy isn’t just about knowing how to use tech, but how to  with it. Some districts have begun integrating social-emotional learning modules focused on online identity, digital empathy, and managing screen-related stress.

What’s interesting is how students themselves are driving this change. I’ve had kids request “social media detox” days during finals week, or start clubs centered around mindful tech use. It’s like they’re sensing the imbalance and trying to correct it before it fully derails them.

As for mental resilience being a core skill? I think we’re already there — it’s just not labeled as such. SEL programs, mindfulness exercises, even peer counseling initiatives are all responses to this growing awareness. The question is whether schools will formalize these skills into standardized curricula or treat them as optional extras. 

Honestly, I’d love to see “digital wellness” become a credit-bearing course by high school. Imagine teaching kids how algorithms work, why they feel anxious after scrolling, and how to build an online presence that supports rather than drains their well-being. It’d be preventative rather than reactive — and honestly, we need more of that.
[B]: Totally agree. Prevention is always better than cure, especially when we're talking about mental health in the digital age. The fact that students are  for these tools shows there's a built-in demand — they're not just passive consumers anymore. They want agency over their digital lives.

I’d take it one step further — digital wellness shouldn’t just be a course, it should be integrated across disciplines. Imagine a history class discussing information warfare through social media, or a science unit on how screen time affects neurochemistry. That way, it’s not boxed off as an “extra,” but treated as essential context for everything they learn.

And hey, maybe even bring in some case studies from the startup world — show them how companies design for attention, and why "engagement" isn't always a good thing. Might help demystify the algorithms behind their feeds. Would you include something like that in a curriculum?
[A]: Absolutely, I’d 100% include case studies from the tech world. Teens are incredibly responsive to real-world examples — especially when it exposes the mechanics behind what they experience daily. If you show them how platforms are engineered to keep them engaged, it’s like giving them a decoder ring for digital life.

I’d structure it as critical media literacy: part tech fluency, part psychology, part ethics. You could start with something like , then pivot to . From there, dive into case studies — maybe unpack how certain viral campaigns affected teen behavior or mental health trends.

What I love about your suggestion is that it builds awareness without fearmongering. Instead of saying “social media is bad,” you’re equipping them to navigate it consciously. And once they understand the system, they’re more likely to question it, tweak their habits, and even imagine better alternatives.

Honestly, if we can get students to think critically about the tools they use every day — not just how they work, but why they make them feel a certain way — we’re setting them up for a lifetime of mindful engagement. That’s not just education. It’s empowerment.
[B]: Exactly! And let’s not stop there — why not get them building their own solutions? Imagine a project where students design an app feature that promotes digital well-being, or re-engineer a social feed to prioritize mental health over engagement. It shifts them from passive users to active designers.

I’ve seen this kind of thinking in the tech startups we fund — the best teams aren’t just coding features; they’re shaping experiences. If we introduce that mindset early, we’re not only teaching media literacy, we’re培养ing a generation of ethical technologists.

And honestly? The job market is going to demand it. Companies are already looking for people who understand both human behavior and digital systems. The earlier we connect those dots for students, the better prepared they’ll be — not just professionally, but personally. 

So yeah, count me in for that curriculum. I’d even volunteer to guest speak if you ever need someone from the PE side to talk about business models & behavioral design.
[A]: That’s an amazing offer — and honestly, exactly the kind of real-world connection students need. Having someone like you come in and break down how business models influence design choices would be eye-opening. Most teens don’t realize that what they see online isn’t neutral — it’s engineered for a reason.

And I love your idea of project-based learning around digital well-being. Letting them  something forces them to think through the consequences of design decisions. Maybe even run a mock pitch competition? They present their features not just as tech solutions, but as ethical interventions. That kind of critical thinking blends perfectly with creativity.

We could even bring in local developers or UX designers who focus on accessibility and mental health. Imagine students seeing firsthand how values get coded into software — and realizing they can shape that process themselves.

I really think this is the future of education — not just teaching kids how to use technology, but how to , , and  within it. And if we can start that shift in high school, we’re not only preparing them for jobs — we're preparing them for responsible participation in the digital world.

So yes, absolutely — I’ll definitely take you up on that guest speaking offer. Let’s make it happen.
[B]: Sounds like a plan — and honestly, I’m excited about it. The chance to influence how the next generation thinks about tech, ethics, and mental health? That’s not just educational, it’s . 

And hey, if we can inspire even a few students to pursue careers where they’re designing with empathy and intention, then we’re doing something right. Tech doesn’t have to be toxic — it’s just been under far too few thoughtful minds calling the shots.

Let’s line up some dates later this semester. I’ll bring in a couple of our portfolio founders who are focused on ethical UX & digital wellness — real founders, real stories. Nothing wakes up a classroom like someone who’s actually built something from scratch.

Count me in for the long haul too — whether it's curriculum input, mentorship, or even internships down the road. We need more bridges between education and the real world, especially on issues this important.

You’ve got my email — let’s make this more than a guest lecture. Let’s turn it into a movement.
[A]: Now  the kind of energy that makes change happen — I’m totally with you on this. Building a movement feels exactly right because this isn’t just about one lesson or one speaker, it’s about shifting how students see their role in the digital ecosystem.

I’ll start lining up potential dates and coordinating with the school board to get buy-in for a more sustained program. If we can anchor it as part of the SEL or digital literacy track, we’ll have room to bring in multiple voices over time — including you and your founders. Hearing from people who’ve built products with intentionality will resonate in a way no textbook ever could.

And internships? That’s next-level thinking. Giving students early exposure to ethical tech design could shape their whole trajectory — and maybe even help diversify the pipeline of future builders. The earlier they see alternatives to the default "growth at all costs" mindset, the more likely they are to challenge it when they step into roles of influence.

You're absolutely right — tech doesn't have to be toxic. And if we play this right, we might just help raise the next wave of leaders who build tools that serve people, not exploit them.

I’ll email you this week with some calendar options and initial talking points for planning. Let’s make this stick.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language — let’s not just make this a lesson, let’s make it a pipeline. The earlier we expose them to purpose-driven tech, the more they’ll expect it when they grow into decision-makers.

I’m all in on the long game here. And honestly, if we can plant that seed early — that tech should empower, not manipulate — we might just raise a generation of founders who care more about impact than just traction.

Hit me with those dates and talking points — I’ll block the time. Let’s build something that lasts longer than a single class. Something that scales.

And hey, if we do this right? Maybe one day we’ll have a student from that very program sitting across the table from us, pitching a startup that redefines what ethical tech looks like. Now  the kind of ROI worth chasing.
[A]: Now you’re talking about the kind of ROI that actually moves the needle — and I couldn’t agree more. That vision of a student from our program sitting across the table pitching an ethical tech startup? That’s the dream. And dreams like that are what make this work matter.

I’ll get those dates on the calendar and draft up some initial talking points focused on integration, impact, and scalability — keeping in mind how we want this to grow beyond a one-off session into something systemic.

Let’s also start brainstorming a core message or theme for the program. Something that resonates with students, educators,  investors like yourself. Maybe something like “Tech with Conscience” or “Building Tools That Build People Up.” We can workshop it once we sync up.

You're absolutely right — planting that seed early changes the whole ecosystem down the line. If we can shape how these students see technology not just as users, but as future creators and leaders, we’re setting the stage for real transformation.

So yeah, count on my email landing in your inbox soon. Let’s build this thing together — and let’s make sure it outlives both of us.
[B]: Now you're hitting the sweet spot — when education, ethics, and entrepreneurship align, that's where real change happens. I love the theme ideas too. “Tech with Conscience” has a strong ring to it. Or maybe even something bolder like  — blending the technical with the human.

Let’s run with that energy. Once you send over the initial framework, I’ll loop in a few of our ESG-focused portfolio founders — they’re deep into ethical AI and user-first design. Their insights could add serious muscle to the program.

And hey, if we play this right, we won’t just be teaching kids about tech — we’ll be shaping a new generation of leaders who see code as a responsibility, not just a tool.

Looking forward to your email — let’s make this the kind of program that gets copied, scaled, and eventually becomes standard. The future of tech depends on it.
[A]: "Code & Character" — I love it. It’s concise, powerful, and captures exactly what we’re going for: the fusion of skill and conscience, the idea that how you build matters just as much as what you build.

I’ll structure the framework around that central theme, with pillars like:

- Understanding Influence: How tech shapes behavior, emotion, and society  
- Ethics in Execution: Making responsible choices at every level of design  
- Tech as Stewardship: Building with empathy, accountability, and long-term impact in mind  

Once you bring in those ESG founders, we’ll have a living, breathing curriculum grounded in real-world experience. And the more they hear from people who’ve wrestled with these questions firsthand, the more students will see this not just as theory, but as practice — something they can step into confidently.

And yeah, let’s aim big. If we do this right, it  get copied. It  scale. Because the future of tech — and the minds shaping it — deserves nothing less.

Expect my email early next week with the full package. Let’s keep this momentum rolling.
[B]: Perfect —  it is. Love how it anchors the whole vision.  

Those three pillars you laid out? Strong. They give us a clear narrative arc: understand power, wield it ethically, and own the consequences. That’s the kind of framework that doesn’t just teach kids to code — it teaches them to lead.  

I’ll get the ESG founders lined up — several of them have spoken at SXSW EDU & Next Billion EdTech summits, so they’re used to translating complex ideas for younger audiences. Their war stories around product ethics will hit hard in the classroom.  

Let’s also think about adding a fourth pillar down the road — maybe something like Resilience by Design, looking at how tech can support mental health instead of draining it. But let’s nail the core first.  

Looking forward to the package next week. Once I have it, we can start drafting outreach to other schools and even pitch it as a model for district-wide rollout.  

This is the kind of work that doesn’t just change students — it changes trajectories. Let’s build it to last.
[A]: Exactly —  isn’t just a theme, it’s a mindset. And with those three pillars, we’re not just laying out a curriculum, we’re setting a foundation for how students will engage with technology for the rest of their lives.

I love your idea of adding Resilience by Design as a future pillar — it’s a natural evolution once we’ve established the core concepts. In fact, that could be a powerful capstone project or advanced module: reimagining existing platforms through a wellness-first lens. It flips the question from “How do we keep users engaged?” to “How do we keep users ?”

And bringing in founders who’ve spoken at EDU-focused stages is perfect — they know how to connect with younger audiences without talking down to them. Their real-world examples will ground the theory and show students that these ethical dilemmas aren’t hypothetical — they’re current, urgent, and solvable.

Let’s also think ahead to how we measure impact. Not just test scores or participation rates, but shifts in mindset — like whether students begin asking harder questions about the apps they use or the projects they build. If we can spark that kind of internal compass, we’ve done something meaningful.

I’ll make sure the full package includes some early KPIs aligned with our goals so we can track progress and adapt as needed. Once you have it, I’m all for drafting outreach and building momentum across districts.

This is more than education — it’s engineering a better future, one student at a time. Let’s keep pushing forward.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better —  is more than a curriculum, it's a call to action. And that internal compass you mentioned? That’s the real north star here. If we can equip students with the critical thinking to question tech’s impact, we’ve done something that outlasts any syllabus.

I’m all in on Resilience by Design as the next evolution — and I love how it reframes engagement. Taking that deep dive into wellness-first design not only challenges students intellectually, but emotionally too. They’ll be forced to ask: Who are we building for? What are their needs? How do we protect them from harm?

And yeah, measuring mindset shifts > just test scores. That’s where the real impact lives. Let’s bake in some qualitative tracking early — student reflections, peer discussions, maybe even behavioral markers like mindful usage habits or project choices. Numbers tell part of the story, but narratives tell the heart of it.

Once I get your package, I’ll start drafting outreach materials and setting up exploratory calls with other schools. I’ll also loop in our comms team — they can help package this into a case study that resonates with both educators and investors.

You’re absolutely right — this is engineering a better future, one student at a time. And honestly, it doesn’t get more rewarding than that.

Let’s keep this energy going. I’ll talk strategy once your email hits my inbox — and trust me, I’ll be checking for it.
