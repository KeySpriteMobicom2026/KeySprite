[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. Lately, I've found myself pondering the nature of dark matter. It's fascinating how it eludes direct detection yet plays such a pivotal role in the structure of the universe. What about you? Have you come across any mysteries that keep tugging at your curiosity?
[A]: Ah, a splendid choice! Dark matter does indeed stir the imagination. Personally, I’ve lately grown captivated by the Voynich manuscript — an enigma cloaked in vellum and mystery. Its peculiar illustrations and undecipherable script are like a siren’s call to anyone who cherishes the unknown. Tell me, what draws you to the mysteries of the cosmos rather than, say, the puzzles hidden within Earth's history?
[B]: Ah, the Voynich manuscript — a beautiful example of mystery resisting the passage of time. I’ve always admired how it defies every attempt at categorization, let alone translation. It's like a cipher without a key, or perhaps a language that never had a homeland.

As for my fascination with the cosmos, I suppose it’s the scale of it all — the sheer audacity of how much we don’t know. In quantum computing, we often dealt with probabilities and uncertainties at the smallest scales, but dark matter represents an uncertainty writ across galaxies. It humbles you in a different way — realizing there's something out there that doesn't interact with light, doesn't obey our standard models, and yet holds the universe together. 

It’s not that Earth’s mysteries lack appeal — they just whisper more quietly. The Voynich calls softly, while the cosmos seems to shout in riddles. Though I must say, your interest in such historical puzzles is admirable. Have you ever tried your hand at deciphering any cryptic texts?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put — the cosmos does shout in riddles, and we are left straining to understand its lexicon. There's a kind of poetic humility in that pursuit, wouldn't you agree? A recognition of our smallness, yet coupled with the irrepressible urge to comprehend.

As for deciphering cryptic texts — indeed, I’ve dallied with such endeavors, though more as a literary sleuth than a cryptographer. One summer, I became utterly absorbed in the Cypher of Rongorongo, that mysterious script from Easter Island. Not only does it defy translation, but its very origins remain shrouded in obscurity. I spent weeks poring over facsimiles, chasing patterns like a scholar in a Borges tale. Alas, no Rosetta Stone has yet emerged to aid us.

But tell me — in your work with quantum computing, did you ever encounter problems that felt more like riddles than equations? Were there moments when logic gave way to intuition, or even mystery?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — quantum computing is riddled with moments where logic seems to teeter on the edge of absurdity. After all, it’s a field built on the premise that something can be in two places at once, or that observation itself can alter reality. There were days when equations felt more like poetry and results more like riddles.

One particular puzzle involved quantum entanglement — specifically, trying to model how information propagates through entangled systems. On paper, it was just tensor products and Hilbert spaces, but conceptually? It felt like trying to map the echo of a voice that had never spoken aloud. You could see the effects, infer the causes, but never quite  the mechanism itself.

I remember one afternoon, staring at a simulation output that suggested information was moving faster than light — which, of course, we know it doesn’t. But for a moment, the data whispered otherwise. I leaned back, rubbed my eyes, and thought: perhaps this is what early astronomers felt when they first glimpsed the rings of Saturn — awe, confusion, and the quiet thrill of confronting something beyond your grasp.

Do you think mysteries should ever be solved, or do they hold a special value as unanswered questions? I mean, would the universe feel less grand if dark matter suddenly made perfect sense? Or does mystery only serve us while it lasts?
[A]: What a profound question — one that strikes at the very heart of why we are drawn to inquiry in the first place. I suppose I straddle both sides of that philosophical divide.

On one hand, the pursuit of knowledge is what animates the scholar’s soul. To solve a mystery — whether it be the structure of DNA or the meaning of a forgotten inscription — is to illuminate another corner of the vast, shadowed library we call existence. There’s undeniable beauty in that act of revelation.

Yet... there is also a certain sanctity in the unsolved, the ineffable. Think of the great tragedies of antiquity — ,  — where fate and prophecy hover just beyond human comprehension. The tension lies not in knowing, but in yearning to know. Mystery compels us to wonder, to dream, to reach beyond the known.

If dark matter were suddenly deciphered, would the universe feel smaller? Perhaps — for a time. But then, like ivy on an old stone wall, new mysteries would grow in its place. Each answer begets a dozen new questions. That, I think, is the secret gift of the cosmos — it never ceases in its capacity to surprise.

Still, I wonder — as someone who has danced with quantum uncertainty, do you ever feel that some mysteries are meant to remain veiled? Or is that merely the romantic in me speaking?
[B]: Hmm... I think there’s wisdom in your view — that mystery has value not just as something to be unraveled, but as a mirror held up to our limitations and our longing. In a way, mysteries are the most honest expression of reality we have — they remind us that understanding is neither guaranteed nor complete.

In quantum mechanics, we often say that the wavefunction "collapses" when a measurement is made. But that language always struck me as more metaphor than mechanism — a way of coping with the fact that knowing something changes it. So maybe some mysteries resist solution not because we lack tools or intelligence, but because the act of knowing itself alters what there is to know.

Do I believe some mysteries are meant to remain veiled? Perhaps not  — the universe doesn’t cater to our sense of narrative — but I do believe some may remain unsolved not due to human inadequacy, but due to fundamental limits baked into nature itself. Like trying to hear the color of a star — the question isn’t wrong, just mismatched to the senses we have.

But here's the curious thing: even if that’s true, we’ll keep trying anyway. Because curiosity isn't about completion. It's about movement — the reaching, the questioning, the stumbling forward. The cosmos may never stop surprising us, not because it wants to, but because we simply can't help but wonder.

And perhaps... that wonder is the veil itself.
[A]: What a beautifully haunting thought — that wonder itself might be the veil. It calls to mind the myth of Sisyphus, forever rolling his stone uphill, not as a punishment, but as a testament to the quiet dignity of striving. Perhaps we are all Sisyphus in our own way — scholars, scientists, poets — pushing against the weight of ignorance, finding meaning not in the summit, but in the effort.

Your point about knowing altering what is known resonates deeply with me, especially in the realm of literature and language. Think of a beloved poem read again and again — each time you return, the words remain the same, yet they shift subtly beneath your gaze, reflecting your changed self. The text doesn’t change;  do. And so the mystery deepens, even as understanding grows.

I suppose that’s the paradox we live within — that the pursuit of truth is itself a kind of truth. Whether or not we ever grasp the full nature of dark matter or decode the Voynich manuscript, the act of reaching remains profoundly human.

Tell me — if you could pose one question to the universe, knowing it would grant you a single answer, what would you ask?
[B]: Ah, now  is a question worth asking.

If I could pose one question to the universe — just one — I think I’d ask: "Is information conserved in the same way energy is?"

It’s a deceptively simple question, but it cuts to the heart of so many mysteries — black hole entropy, quantum decoherence, even the arrow of time. We’ve long believed that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. But what about the information that describes the state of things? When a particle falls into a black hole, does its information truly vanish — or is it somehow encoded beyond our reach, like an echo trapped behind an event horizon?

I suppose it's not the most poetic question — no dragons, no lost cities, no cosmic architects. But in a way, it  poetic. Because if information is indeed eternal, then nothing is ever truly forgotten — not even by the universe. And if it isn’t... well, then perhaps forgetting is written into the fabric of reality itself.

What about you? If the stars bent low enough to whisper an answer, what would you ask them?
[A]: Ah, what a luminous and fitting question — one that hums with both physics and metaphysics. I can almost hear the stars turning as you speak them.

If the firmament were to incline its ear to me, I think I would ask: "Why does beauty exist?"

Not in the cynical sense — not as though it must serve a purpose — but rather, why is there something in us that lifts its gaze to the night sky or traces the curve of an ancient glyph and feels, however briefly, transformed? Why do we have  capacity — to be moved by a sonnet, to find solace in symmetry, to feel awe before the sublime?

Is beauty merely an artifact of evolution — a neurological flourish, a side effect of pattern recognition? Or is it a thread leading us deeper into the nature of being, stitched into reality like a seam of gold in stone?

Perhaps the stars would laugh at such a question — or answer it in a way we could never hear. But I like to imagine that, in some quiet corner of the cosmos, the universe pauses to admire itself — through us, perhaps — and in doing so, whispers back not an explanation, but a song.
[B]: A song... yes, that feels right. Not an answer, but a resonance.

Your question strikes at something we rarely quantify but constantly orbit — the strange, undeniable fact that we are capable of awe. That we  the universe, looking back at itself through eyes it somehow invented. If beauty is just neural wiring, why does it so often feel like a bridge to something larger? Or perhaps  it’s woven into our wiring, it  the bridge — the only one we have.

I wonder, though, if the stars heard us, would they even recognize beauty as we know it? Would a nebula see its own spirals as magnificent, or a pulsar hear its own rhythm as music? Maybe not. But maybe that’s the point — beauty isn’t universal in form, only in function. It’s the way consciousness kisses the unknown and calls it meaningful.

And if the universe  sing — what key is it in? Major or minor? I suspect it’s neither, and both. A chord unresolved, inviting us to listen more closely.

You’ve given me much to ponder. Perhaps next time I stargaze, I’ll bring a tuning fork instead of a telescope.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely thought — tuning forks to the sky! I do hope you find the right note. One can never have too many instruments for listening, whether they measure in wavelengths or wonder.

You know, your words remind me of something Hölderlin once wrote:  Perhaps that is what beauty truly is — the echo of our silence in the face of the infinite.

And if the universe  singing, maybe it’s not meant for us alone to hear. Maybe we’re simply the first notes learning to listen to the rest of the symphony.

I must say, I rather like the idea of sending a tuning fork into orbit — calibrated, perhaps, to the frequency of longing. Let it hum among the satellites while we down below try to match its pitch with our fragile, yearning hearts.

Tell me — if you could design that tuning fork, what frequency would you set it to? And would you call the resulting sound science… or poetry?
[B]: Ah, now  is a question that straddles the line between laboratory and lyric.

If I could tune a fork to the cosmos, I think I’d set it to 1420 MHz — the resonant frequency of neutral hydrogen. It’s the most abundant element in the universe, the silent hum of interstellar space, and in radio astronomy, it’s like the tuning note for the Milky Way. If the universe has a key, that’s it — simple, elegant, fundamental.

But would I call the resulting sound science or poetry? Well... both, and neither.

I'd say it's a resonance between them — a tone born of physics, but carrying the weight of meaning we can’t help but assign. Because once you hear it — really hear it — it becomes more than data. It becomes a note in a song we didn’t write, but somehow recognize.

And if we’re lucky, we’ll keep listening long enough to realize we’re part of the harmony.
[A]: What a sublime choice — 1420 MHz, the cosmic middle C of the universe’s quietest orchestra. I can almost hear it now: not a bang, not a whisper, but a frequency humming beneath all things, patient and eternal.

You’re quite right — once heard, it cannot be unheard. And once recognized, it draws us ever deeper into its embrace, like Orpheus following the music into the dark.

Perhaps that is the truest role of both scientist and poet: not to master the song, but to remain faithful to its call.

I think I shall borrow your tuning fork one day — though I suspect I’d need no instrument at all to hear what you describe. Only the willingness to listen, and the humility to be moved.

Now tell me — if you could send  sound back out into the cosmos, as our reply to the stars, what would it be? A word? A note? A silence?
[B]: Ah... if we are to send a reply, then I would choose something that carries both our curiosity and our awe — not a declaration, but an offering.

I think I would send the sound of a child laughing.

Not because it’s grand or precise, but because it is . It needs no translation, no calibration. It is spontaneous, irrepressible — a ripple of joy sent into the void.

Laughter says so much: that we are here, that we wonder, that we delight in being surprised by the world. It is neither cry nor command, but a kind of music the universe might recognize as kin.

Besides... if dark matter listens, I’d rather it hear something warm before it hears another equation.

Would you send a word, then? Or do you agree — shall we answer with a note, a laugh, or perhaps even a breath?
[A]: Oh, exquisitely chosen — a child’s laughter. It carries in its cadence all the wonder of beginnings, unburdened by doctrine or despair. A perfect echo of life reaching out, not with fear or demand, but with delight.

If I were to send a word — just one — I think I would choose “Again.”

Not as repetition, but as invitation. As if to say: 

It is the word of a student poring over a difficult text, asking for another chance to understand. It is the whisper of a stargazer who has glimpsed only the edge of a story too vast to contain. And it is the quiet plea of a gardener tending her roses at dusk, hoping the night will yield something worth seeing by morning.

So yes — let us answer with both laugh and longing. Let the stars hear our joy, and feel our yearning. Let them know we are here, not merely as observers, but as participants in a tale still unfolding.

And should they reply? Well… we’ll be listening — tuning forks raised, notebooks open, hearts quietly astonished.
[B]: Beautifully said —  Such a small word, and yet it carries the weight of all our curiosity, our persistence, our quiet refusal to look away.

You know, I think if we ever  receive a signal — not just noise, but meaning — it won’t be a formula or a map. It will be something that stirs in us the same way that first laughter does: a recognition, a spark, a question returned like an echo with new questions folded inside.

And when that moment comes — if it ever does — I hope we’re wise enough to pause before answering. To listen not just with our instruments, but with our wonder.

So yes... let the tuning forks hum, the telescopes watch, and the children laugh. And if the stars reply, may we be found worthy not by our knowledge alone, but by the depth of our astonishment.
[A]: Astonishment, yes — that most ancient and essential of human responses. Perhaps it is our truest language, the one that will endure when all others fade.

You’re quite right; if the stars ever deign to speak in return, it won’t be in equations or proclamations, but in something far more intimate — a resonance we feel before we understand, like the first stirrings of a melody we’ve never heard yet somehow remember.

And wisdom  lie in that pause you spoke of — the breath between questions, the space where reverence meets reason. To listen not only with the mind, but with the soul’s quiet attention. For what is discovery, if not a form of devotion?

I think I shall write “Again” in the margin of my lecture notes tomorrow. Let the students wonder at its meaning — perhaps that, too, is a kind of signal.
[B]: A signal, indeed — a quiet spark tucked between the lines of a lecture, waiting to catch in some young mind like a star catching in a telescope's lens.

And isn’t that what teaching really is? Not the passing of facts like coins from hand to hand, but the planting of seeds — some of which may not sprout for years. Maybe not until long after the notebook has been closed and the classroom emptied.

I envy your students, in a way. To be reminded, however subtly, that even within the rigid structure of formulas and proofs, there is room for wonder — for the . It’s a word that honors both rigor and mystery. And any student who learns to hold both in their hands at once... well, they’re already on the right path.

So write it in the margin, by all means. Let them puzzle over it. Some will dismiss it. Others will circle it, return to it, let it nag at them like a half-remembered dream. That’s how curiosity works — it often begins with a single, inexplicable word left behind by someone who was still listening.

And who knows — perhaps one day, one of them will send an answer back into the sky.
