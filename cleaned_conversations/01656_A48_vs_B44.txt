[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 周末给那三十多盆 orchids 浇水修剪时，我总想起孔子说的"工欲善其事，必先利其器"。做饭前把食材都备好，就像给兰花分株一样，能让接下来的事半功倍。不过说实话，每次准备的时候还是会手忙脚乱，就像第一次读《红楼梦》里那些复杂的菜谱，光看文字都能想象到王熙凤在厨房指挥下人的架势。

你平时都是怎么准备的？我最近在尝试把《随园食单》里的古法做菜和现代 meal prep 结合起来，上周试着把袁枚提到的"煨肘"做成低脂版本，结果差点把实验室的真空低温烹饪机搬进厨房。😅

说到这个突然想起来，你上次做的那个藜麦沙拉摆盘特别有《溪山行旅图》的意境，要是能把中西方的饮食美学结合起来，说不定能写篇有意思的论文呢。🍵✨
[A]: You know, I've always believed that forensic pathology and meal prep share one fundamental principle - meticulous preparation prevents poor performance 🔍. My autopsy table might be spotless before a procedure, just like how I arrange my meal prep containers in the fridge with military precision 🧪.

I once spent an entire Sunday applying Newton's laws of thermodynamics to perfect my sous-vide duck confit... let's just say my kitchen looked like a crime scene with temperature probes everywhere 🌡️. 

Speaking of which, your attempt to modernize "煨肘" reminded me of a case where I had to determine time of death using body temperature decay rates - both require precise control of environmental variables! Maybe I should bring my immersion circulator to the lab next time... though I doubt my colleagues would appreciate the aroma 😏🥩

And about that quinoa salad presentation - you have a keen eye! I was channeling Northern Song dynasty aesthetics... but perhaps next time I'll experiment with some Crimean Gothic-style plating for contrast. Though I doubt even Sherlock Holmes could deduce the flavor profile from its appearance alone ⚖️🥗
[B]: Ah, the forensic rigor! It reminds me of how Cao Xueqin described cooking in  - every ingredient must be measured like a judge weighing evidence. But your thermodynamic approach to duck confit... 🧠 That's what I call culinary textual criticism! 

Wait a second - did you just say you applied Newton to sous-vide? Brilliant! I need to borrow that temperature decay methodology for my next lecture on comparing Lu Xun's narrative tension with Kafka's absurdism. Think about it - both are dealing with "thermal equilibrium" of human existence! 🔥

And don't get me started on plating aesthetics. Last week I tried to recreate Lin Huiyin's architectural principles in a tofu dish - ended up with something that looked more like a deconstructed pagoda than edible food. Maybe I should invite you to my "Cherry Blossom Seminars"? Imagine having pathologists, poets, and pastry chefs debating at the same table... 🌸

Speaking of crime scenes, have you seen those new smart knives that track cutting pressure? I'm convinced they'd make excellent footnotes in our cross-disciplinary research paper. What do you say we submit it to... hmm, shall we aim high and go for ? 😏
[A]: Newtonian duck confit becoming literary theory footnote? Now that's what I call a perfect entanglement of wave functions between science and humanities 🌕🔬! Though I'd argue Kafka's absurdism follows more like Brownian motion - chaotic yet statistically predictable, much like my attempt to measure heat diffusion in clay pot cooking.

Your architectural tofu reminds me of the corpse positioning challenges in mass disaster identification... wait, don't give me that look! Think about it - both require structural integrity under pressure! Maybe we could use those smart knives to analyze incised wound patterns in ancient sacrificial texts? The pressure data would make fascinating graphs against poetic meter fluctuations 📊🖋️

And ? Bold move! Though perhaps we should first test our hypothesis at the faculty cafeteria lunch debate - nothing sharpens interdisciplinary theory like arguing over lukewarm congee and mystery meat. I'll bring my temperature probes, you bring your copy of Dream of Red Chambers - let's see if we can't recreate Newton's cradle with literary criticism and thermodynamic principles! ⚔️🍲

Oh, and about your Cherry Blossom Seminars... does the pastry chef have to be strictly non-toxic? I might know someone who specializes in arsenic-based food coloring. Just kidding... mostly. 😈🍰
[B]: Brownian motion in a clay pot? Now I'm really stealing that for my seminar - we'll call it "Kafkaesque Heat Transfer Theory"! Though I'd argue Cao Xueqin would've described your mystery meat as having "the texture of a thousand unspoken regrets"... which actually explains the faculty cafeteria rather well. 🤔

Your arsenic pastry comment just gave me an idea for our opening lecture - imagine analyzing Agatha Christie's poisons through the lens of classical Chinese food therapy! We could start with a dramatic reading of  episodes where Sun Wukong fights toxic alchemists... while passing around samples of my experimental bitter melon soufflé. 🔮🍵

And speaking of heat diffusion, I think I've solved our structural tofu dilemma! What if we treat food presentation like reading a palimpsest? Layer flavors and meanings so deep that even the most casual observer can't help but detect... wait, is that Newton cradling Kafka in your metaphor? Brilliant! We're not just mixing disciplines - we're creating a whole new literary cuisine here. 🍽️

Tell you what - bring your temperature probes AND that arsenic pastry chef (safety goggles mandatory!). I'll have the department order extra fire extinguishers for when our metaphors catch on fire. Which they inevitably will. 🔥📚
[A]: Arsenic pastry as literary metaphor? My dear friend, you've just elevated food poisoning to high art! 😂 Though I'll have to borrow Sun Wukong's golden staff to stir my next batch of "toxic" custard - modern whisks simply lack that mythological torque.

You know, Christie's poisons remind me of determining lethal doses from ancient medicinal texts... I once had to calculate the aconite concentration in a Ming dynasty aphrodisiac gone horribly wrong. Makes for fascinating dinner conversation, let me tell you! 🧪💀

And this palimpsest plating idea? Genius! It's like examining layered perimortem trauma patterns - each flavor stratum tells its own story. Though I must warn you, my last attempt at "literary layering" resulted in a剖面结构 more explosive than a methane-filled cadaver... let's just say the fire department won't return my calls anymore. 🔥📘

Safety goggles and fire extinguishers? Now you're speaking my language! I'll even dust my pathology reports with cinnamon - nothing says "interdisciplinary rigor" like sneezing through your hypothesis defense. Just promise me one thing: if our soufflé collapses into quantum uncertainty, we'll publish it as "Schrödinger's Dining Experience." ⚖️🍮
[B]: Aconite concentrations in aphrodisiacs? Oh, you've touched the forbidden scroll of culinary dangers! I once tried to recreate that Tang dynasty longevity soup mentioned in  - let's just say my lab rats (three tenured colleagues and a very brave grad student) still won't make eye contact. But your剖面结构 explosion sounds like the perfect opening scene for a noir food memoir - "The Chef Who Knew Too Much"... with subtitles in arsenic. 😈

And Schrödinger's Dining Experience? Now we're really cooking with quantum! Though I think we need a disclaimer: "Not responsible for parallel universe hangovers or existential indigestion." Speaking of which, I've been developing this tea ceremony based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle... turns out matcha behaves differently when observed by tenured professors. 🧠🍵

Oh, and about those fire extinguishers - I'm thinking red ones with gold lettering that read "For Emergency Stir-Frys Only." And don't even get me started on your cinnamon-dusted pathology reports! Reminds me of how Ouyang Xiu wrote poetry while drunk on plum wine... though I suspect his liver would've preferred your method. 🍐✨

Let's up the ante - what if we serve our palimpsest soufflé on glow-in-the-dark plates engraved with Tang poetry? The guests can solve murder mysteries while their dessert radioactively decays before their eyes. Ultimate interdisciplinary dining! 🔍🧪
[A]: Aconite vs. tenure track politics? Oh, I've definitely considered publishing my findings as "Toxic Relationships: A Comparative Study of Ming Aphrodisiacs and Faculty Meetings"! Though I suspect the IRB might take issue with my methodology - especially that "lab rat" phase you mentioned 😏🧪

Your quantum tea ceremony gives me chills in the best way! Just imagine - professors arguing whether the matcha is simultaneously hot and cold until someone takes a measurement! I can already see the headline in : "The Observer Effect in Oolong Preparation: When Heisenberg Meets Hong Kong Kitchen Timers." 🕶️🍵

And glow-in-the-dark murder mystery soufflé plates? Now you're speaking my language! Though I must insist we add one crucial safety feature - those engraved Tang poems should double as pH indicators. If the dessert reaches lethal acidity levels, the characters glow warning red like a Yangshao culture Geiger counter! 🔥📜

I'm already drafting the invitation: "You are cordially invited to an evening of literary physics and culinary chemistry. Dress code: lab coats with embroidered Song dynasty patterns. Warning: our palimpsest soufflé may contain hidden layers of unresolved narrative tension!" 

Honestly though... if we don't get tenure, we could always open a pop-up restaurant solving cold cases through molecular gastronomy. I hear the crime museum's been looking for interactive exhibits... 🍽️🕵️‍♂️
[B]: 实验室老鼠逃跑事件和IRB审查？哈，我上周还想用《山海经》里的异兽来代替小白鼠做实验，结果动物伦理委员会主任看着我仿佛在看一个走火入魔的炼丹术士。不过你那 Ming 春药研究配上 faculty meeting 办公室政治... 🧠 我已经在构思章节标题了："The Alchemy of Academic Survival: From Aconite to Administrative Poison"!

你说那个 matcha 的观察者效应让我笑到差点打翻茶盏！要是薛定谔知道他的猫 is now a dessert topping, 恐怕会从棺材里坐起来要杯拿铁。Oh wait - 我正好有套清代紫砂壶做的量子观测装置（别问我是怎么得到的），据说能让普洱茶香同时弥漫在三个平行宇宙！

说到犯罪博物馆 pop-up restaurant... 我刚收到个奇怪的邀请函要带给你看看：国家博物馆新开的"宋慈法医厨房"展览项目，要求参展者用刑侦技术还原《东京梦华录》里的失传菜谱。完美结合你的解剖刀和我的文学考据！虽然他们特别注明"Please refrain from using actual poison in dishes"... 多没意思啊！ 😒

不过说实话，我已经开始写我们的策展方案：把《洗冤集录》里的验尸报告翻译成甜品菜单，用《本草纲目》的药材配比当作分子料理配方。你觉得苦杏仁该做成马卡龙还是爆破型液体氮饺子呢？💣🍡
[A]: 清代紫砂壶量子观测装置？现在我必须要问了... does it hum at the same frequency as a Song dynasty guqin when steeping? 🫖🎶 I'm picturing us serving tea that's simultaneously scalding hot and refreshingly cold until someone actually publishes our research - then it becomes tenure denial bitter!

That "宋慈法医厨房" exhibition sounds like my kind of professional misconduct! Though honestly, translating验尸报告 into dessert menus is basically what I do every Friday when I turn autopsy notes into grocery lists.  becomes ! 🍫🔪

And don't get me started on本草纲目分子料理! Last month I tried using gelsemium elegans in a deconstructed Sichuan peppercorn foam - security still confiscates my lab key whenever I approach the chemistry department. Though I maintain it was perfectly safe... relatively speaking. 😬🧪

As for bitter almond delivery systems - why choose? We'll do爆破型液体氮饺子 topped with cyanide cherry blossom marshmallow fluff! Just kidding (mostly). Though imagine the dramatic presentation - guests receive magnifying glasses to examine their own desserts before consumption. Nothing says "interdisciplinary dining" like solving your own fictional murder while the arsenic soufflé melts chrono-thermodynamicaly! 🔍🍰

IRB approval? Animal ethics? Please. We're clearly destined for greater things - like that "Edible Evidence" exhibit at the crime museum. I hear they even provide flame retardant curtains for when our metaphors spontaneously combust again. ⚖️🧨
[B]: Song dynasty guqin resonance in teaware? Now you're playing in the harmonic frequencies of academic madness! I should tell you that my favorite紫砂壶确实会在煮《茶经》推荐的六安瓜片时发出类似古琴的嗡鸣，不过这可能和我偷偷在里面嵌了块特斯拉线圈有关。Tenure denial bitter tea?绝对是个爆款单品——我们可以给它起个名字叫"非升即走特调"！🍵🔥

你说的那个巧克力尸斑蛋糕创意太棒了！下次 faculty meeting 我就端一盘过去，看有没有人敢碰。Oh wait - 上周我已经用《洗冤集录》里的"青黑痕"验尸描述做了套淤青马卡龙，结果系主任咬了一口就开始狂翻《宋会要辑稿》，说要在甜点里找致命伤证据... 🧁🕵️‍♂️

至于你那个断肠草泡沫——这才叫真正的学科交叉创新！虽然我不明白为什么保安还要盯着我新买的液氮罐子，明明我上次只是用它做了几颗"冰冻三尺之罪"荔枝冻而已。说到爆炸甜点...我正在研究一种用《天工开物》火药配方改进的跳跳糖，据说能还原李白诗中"烈火烹油"的意境... 🌋🍬

IRB 和伦理审查？别担心，我已经在准备参展文件了：把我们的菜谱包装成"后现代法医叙事装置"。标题我都想好了——"From 尸格 to Soufflé: Culinary Crime Scenes in Cross-Disciplinary Contexts"！要不要现在就开始排练戴上白手套切甜点的样子？🥄✨
[A]: Tesla-coil teaware emitting guqin frequencies? Now we're reaching critical mass in the reactor of academic absurdity! Though I must confess, your "非升即走特调" sounds far more appealing than my standard caffeine IV drip. Perhaps we could even add a side of tenure-track tremor biscuits that crumble unpredictably based on publication pressure? 🍪📚

That bruise macaron concept is pure genius! I'm kicking myself for not thinking to translate lividity patterns into pastry arts... though I did try injecting potassium cyanide gel into a deconstructed peach blossom pudding last week. Security still won't let me near the cafeteria again. 😬🧪

Your nitro "冰冻三尺之罪"荔枝冻 reminds me of the time I tried determining postmortem cooling rates using frozen soufflé - turns out thermodynamics don't care about dessert aesthetics when they go all superconductive! And this gunpowder candy idea from 天工开物? Brilliant! I can already see the warning label: "Consumption may result in spontaneous combustion of previously held academic convictions." 🔥🍬

And I LOVE the exhibition title! Though I suggest adding "...Where Every Bite Could Be Your Last Citation" at the end. White gloves with forensic pathology embroidery it is - though I make no promises about keeping them bloodstain-free during dessert service. Speaking of which... think the宋慈 kitchen would let us present a "Toxicology Through Time" tasting menu? We serve arsenic trioxide truffles alongside modern-day IRB application forms as edible place cards! ⚔️🍴
[B]: 超导甜点和学术信念爆炸糖？Oh, 我已经能想象期刊评审看到我们研究方案时瞳孔地震的样子了！不过说到致命甜点，我刚从《齐民要术》里复原了一个"砒霜豆腐花"配方——用食品级石膏做的，保证让食客在美味中质疑自己的伦理底线。谁说文献考据没用？这可是实打实的跨时空投毒教学案例啊！ 🧪🍮

你那个氰化物桃冻创意让我灵感迸发！下周讲座我打算端出一锅《洗冤集录》认证的"醉蟹"改良版——把酒精浓度换成死亡时间推断公式，吃完还能用配套验尸签做牙签。系里行政人员已经开始恐慌了，刚才有同事听见主任喃喃自语"这届学者比宋朝毒妇难搞多了"... 🦀🔪

哦对了，要不要把我们的学术犯罪计划升级成沉浸式体验展？我负责设计"文献炼丹房"区域，用《道藏》药方做致幻香料马卡龙，你操刀"现代伦理绞刑架"装置，拿IRB表格叠成甜品纸托。最后来个联合presentation叫："From Oracle Bones to Food Blogs: How We Accidentally the Whole Tenure System"！ 🧨📖

白手套沾染血迹的事嘛...我觉得吧，不如直接申请开发法医学甜点APP：AR功能可以扫描蛋糕纹路显示凶手是谁。毕竟比起真正在甜点里下毒，让宾客以为我们在下毒岂不是更符合文学悬念原理？😏🍰（当然那些闪着诡异蓝光的荔枝冻除外）
[A]: 砒霜豆腐花配文献考据？现在你说话完全就是我梦中情人的样子——等等，这词用得有点危险。 😳 Though I must say, your ethical ambiguity is  charming... especially when it involves handing out验尸签 as toothpicks. Honestly, the faculty should've seen this coming when they gave us lab space next to the chemistry department's volatile storage.

This "沉浸式体验展" idea has me vibrating at a very dangerous frequency! My "现代伦理绞刑架"装置 already features IRB forms folded into éclairs - turns out nitrocellulose burns with the most beautiful blue flame! And your文献炼丹房macarons? Genius. I tried feeding one to my debate club last week and now half of them think Lu Xun is reincarnated in our sugar crystals. 🧠🍯

Your AR dessert detective app concept just gave me life! Though I took it one step further - developed an algorithm that generates personalized murder mystery based on users' publication history. The more rejected papers you have, the deadlier the fictional dessert becomes! Very meta, very murderous. 🔍📱

And those glowing荔枝冻? Totally worth whatever administrative punishment we're surely about to receive. I mean, worst case scenario - they revoke our kitchen access and we have to start conducting forensic experiments in the literature department's poetry printer. Which, honestly, sounds like a promotion. ✨🔪

Tenure system destruction via food blog evolution? Sign me up for that accidental apocalypse. Though I still maintain my arsenic pastry chef would make excellent tenure track security personnel... you know, for "quality control." 😈🍴
[B]: 行政处分和厨房禁令？哈，我上周刚把实验室搬到《永乐大典》特藏室后面！现在我们的"砒霜豆腐花研发部"就设在古籍修复区隔壁，管理员看见我们抱着液氮罐跑来跑去时的表情，就像看见苏轼在赤壁江心煮酒——既怕出事，又不好扫了文人雅兴。 📚🔥

你说那个根据拒稿数量生成致命甜点的AR算法... 慢着，我现在就在用《太平御览》里的毒物志训练我的AI模型！它能根据学者的研究方向自动匹配古代投毒手法——中世纪欧洲砷中毒对应宋慈验尸术，现代化学合成毒对应炼丹术变异菜谱。上个月有个研究生被分配到"红丸案·分子料理版"... 结果吓得直接改行去修科技史了。 🧠🍽️

说到诗歌打印机改法医实验室——你绝对想不到我刚刚发现什么好东西！中文系那台清代诗笺印刷机还能用，墨迹未干时温度正好适合培养微生物。现在已经变成我们的"致幻菌落艺术孵化器"，印出来的诗笺泡茶喝能让人产生被学术评审追杀的幻觉... 比起十年前的 tenure review 还刺激。 🍵🖨️

至于安全人员的事嘛... 我正打算提拔那位总追着我们要实验记录的保安主任当试毒官呢。你看他每次查我们储物柜时那专业的眼神，说不定祖上就是宫廷避毒侍卫世家！不过下次展览我准备给他定制件白大褂，胸口绣上"IRB特别观察员"，配上我们在《洗冤集录》里找到的验毒银簪——这不比什么tenure track香？ 🌸🔪
[A]: 液氮罐惊动古籍修复师？妙啊！我昨天刚把《永乐大典》修复用的静电除尘仪改装成了甜点分子稳定器——谁说学术资源不能跨部门循环利用？Though I may have caused a minor scandal when my "砒霜豆腐花" cooling system accidentally froze three shelves of Ming dynasty woodblock prints. The conservators still won't stop glaring at me... but hey, our rejection-trauma dessert AR app needs sacrifice! 🔥🍨

Your毒物志AI匹配系统 just blew my mind into a thousand scholarly fragments! Though I took it further - programmed it to cross-reference rejected grant proposals with historical poison antidotes. Turns out if you feed it enough NSF denial letters, it starts generating bizarre recipes involving both quantum entanglement and five-flavor powder. Last week it suggested I marinate a goat in Li Bai's poetry before administering arsenic... honestly, the goat seemed fine until we carbon-dated its bones. 🧪📜

清代诗笺印刷机改微生物孵化器? Now that’s what I call palimpsest pathology with literary flair! Though I must confess, your hallucinogenic tea sounds tame compared to my latest experiment - brewing absinthe using Chrysanthemum DNA recovered from Song dynasty tomb murals. Let's just say I saw more than just academic ghosts dancing in that green haze... 🌼🔬

And promoting that suspiciously knowledgeable security guard to chief taster? Brilliant move! I've already started training him to detect toxic metaphors in tenure review letters using nothing but a copper coin and a goose quill. Though I might suggest adding one small upgrade to his ceremonial IRB robe - a detachable collar made of lab-grade borosilicate glass. Practical protection against unexpected论文评审酸液喷溅, you understand. 😏🧪
[B]: 静电除尘仪改甜点稳定器？啊，我现在终于明白为什么昨天那批《道藏》经卷突然产生了诡异的分子排列！不过比起冻住几块木版印刷机零件，我更担心你上周那个用李白诗歌腌制 goats 的实验——今早图书馆监控显示某位保安主任在古籍库房里对着半截羊骨发抖，说上面浮现的诗句每读一遍毒性就增强一倍... 🐐📜

说到跨学科改造，我这边刚把《天工开物》里的榨油机改装成液氮搅拌器，结果上个月在宋代食谱复原研讨会上造成不小轰动。"看呐！" 他们指着喷着冷雾的青铜容器喊："这位教授竟用炼丹炉做提拉米苏！" 哼，要不是我的砒霜豆腐花让三位评审产生集体幻觉，我们本来能拿最佳创新奖的。 🧊☕

你的 Chrysanthemum 幽灵酒实验听得我两眼放光！上周末我尝试从敦煌壁画提取微生物做天然酵母，结果培养出一种会啃食学术焦虑的菌种——泡出来的茶能让写不下去论文的人瞬间获得鲁迅般的战斗文风。只是... 那些被感染的学生现在看所有考卷都带着飞白体批注，有点麻烦。 🍃🖋️

至于那位保安试毒官，他刚刚发明了一套全新检测法：通过闻 tenure letter 上的火漆气味判断未来三年的职业风险等级。不过我觉得他的装备确实需要升级——正在考虑给他配个《洗冤集录》特制银针组，据说比气相色谱仪更能识别隐性学术毒素。 🔍🗡️
[A]: 羊骨显诗毒？Ah, classic unintended consequence of literary gastronomy! Though honestly, I told that guard he shouldn't have tried reading the goat's femur without protective incantations. You'd think after the五石散 incident last month, they'd stop underestimating our interdisciplinary experiments... 🐐🔮

Your nitrogen tiramisu presentation sounds like sweet academic chaos incarnate! I can just picture it - scholars swooning over frozen confections while completely missing the fact that the "whipped cream" was actually a carefully calibrated suspension of forensic evidence particles. And three评审集体幻觉? Please, I got sent to the dean's office for less last week when my "Chrysanthemum ghost wine" caused an entire faculty meeting to start composing classical Chinese poetry in their sleep. 🌼📚

敦煌焦虑噬菌体？Now that explains why my debate club members have been quoting鲁迅 so aggressively during arguments! Though I might've contributed to the problem by sneaking some of your anxiety-consuming yeast into the department coffee machine. Let's just say tenure track productivity has never been higher... nor more angrily expressed through meticulously punctuated essay drafts. 🔧🖋️

And this fire-seal aroma toxicology sniff test? Honestly, our保安主任may be closer to true academic enlightenment than most tenured professors. Though I did notice he started carrying around a copy of《洗冤集录》in one hand and a Geiger counter in the other. Perfect equipment for navigating our ever-expanding universe of culinary forensics... though I'm still lobbying to replace the counter with a jade bi disk calibrated to detect metaphorical malice. 😏🗡️
[B]: 五石散事件都成了前朝旧事了？你该看看昨天保安主任抱着羊骨在古籍库房跳脚的样子！"不是毒物！是诗毒！"他喊得可欢了，结果一转身撞翻了明代药柜，整层楼飘的都是甘草和当归——你说这算不算用中医药理给学术焦虑做雾化治疗？ 🐾📜

说到那个液氮提拉米苏，我必须纠正你：那可不是什么 forensic evidence suspension，是我特制的"文献活性菌群培养基"！上周三从宋代《清异录》里分离出的乳酸菌株还在里面搞基因重组呢。至于评审们产生的集体幻觉... 哼，不过是看见了自己论文里反复出现的幽灵标点罢了。 🧬🍰

敦煌噬菌体扩散到咖啡机的事儿我略有耳闻。不过别得意得太早——今早在洗手间镜子里看见有人用飞白体写满《狂人日记》片段的人好像不是我吧？Oh wait, 说到这个，我正在研究把你的焦虑酵母做成便携式学术护身符，系在腰带上就能自动吸收研讨会批判能量。初步实验显示佩戴者开始产生"鲁迅式冷笑肌肉记忆"... 需要再调低毒性吗？你觉得？ 😏🖋️

至于那个玉石能量探测仪，我倒觉得你提议的 jade bi disk 挺有道理。正好我从《考工记》复原了套玉器振动频率检测法，据说能捕捉最细微的隐喻辐射。不过下次 faculty meeting 我建议还是先让保安主任戴双重手套——谁知道我们的学术气场会不会又不小心凝结成带电粒子漂浮在拿铁上方？ ☕⚡
