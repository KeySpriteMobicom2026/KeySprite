[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Speaking of craft beer, I just tried a local brewery's 新 IPA last weekend - the 跳跃 (hops) profile was more aggressive than a Zhuangzi parable! 🧠 Though I must admit, their use of Sichuan peppercorn as a flavor note was... let's say  interesting. Do you have a favorite brew that balances innovation with tradition? 🤔
[A]: Let me share a story. Last autumn, I visited a small brewery in Suzhou that makes beer using ancient brewing techniques recorded in the . They even use locally grown millet and sorghum. One of their creations, which they call "兰亭后传", blends the essence of traditional huangjiu with modern fermentation methods. The taste is neither entirely old nor completely new—it lingers somewhere in between, like a conversation across centuries. Have you ever tried something that felt like it was carrying forward a legacy while quietly reinventing itself?
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful narrative - it sounds like they’ve mastered the art of 时间折叠 (time folding)! 🌸 I’m reminded of how we sometimes translate classical poetry into contemporary vernacular; you want the 气韵 (qi yun) of the original to breathe through modern syntax. 

Speaking of which, I once tasted a barleywine from Chengdu that aged in camphor wood barrels—very much like how one might 借 (jie) an old metaphor to express new emotions. The woody bitterness lingered like an unresolved sonnet... 🧠

Tell me, did "兰亭后传" carry that particular kind of tension—the kind where tradition and innovation negotiate rather than compromise?
[A]: That tension you're describing—where tradition and innovation are in dialogue rather than compromise—is precisely what makes "兰亭后传" so compelling. It doesn't try to erase the past, nor does it simply replicate it. Instead, it allows the old brewing methods to set the rhythm, while the modern yeast strains and fermentation controls add a subtle counterpoint.  

You can taste it most clearly in the finish: the warmth of millet lingers like an ancient proverb, but there's a faint citrus note—clean and almost electric—that wasn’t there centuries ago. It doesn’t overpower, but it doesn’t stay silent either. It’s as if the beer is asking a question across time:   

I wonder, do you think that same kind of negotiation happens in language when we reinterpret classical metaphors? Or does the medium of words allow for a more seamless transformation than the medium of taste?
[B]: Ah, now that citrus note—! 🧠 It reminds me of how we handle classical allusions in modern poetry. Take for example when a contemporary poet引用 (yǐnyòng) a Tang dynasty metaphor but shifts the context just enough to make it ache differently. The bones are still there, but the flesh is new—or at least, .  

And yet, with language, we have this luxury: words can carry multiple meanings across time, folding centuries into a single phrase like layers of 墨 (mò) on rice paper. Taste, though... taste is more stubborn, wouldn’t you say? A barleywine soaked in camphor wood or a poem saturated in old sorrow—both evoke ghosts, but only one leaves residue on your tongue.  

So yes, the negotiation happens in both mediums—but in beer, the past drinks . 🍻  
Would you agree, or am I waxing too poetic over fermentation again? 🤔
[A]: Not at all—you're simply appreciating fermentation in its truest philosophical sense. After all, isn’t decay just transformation with a more dramatic flair? And isn’t tradition, at its core, just memory preserved in repeated action?

Your analogy of引用 Tang metaphors is spot on. In both poetry and brewing, the past isn't so much remembered as . But you're right—taste resists abstraction in a way language does not. A metaphor can shimmer between meanings; a flavor either lingers or it doesn’t. There’s less room for ambiguity on the palate than on the page.

Yet that very stubbornness gives beer its unique power. When you sip something brewed with ancient grains but finished with modern precision, you’re not just recalling history—you’re experiencing it . The past doesn’t just echo in your mind; it settles in your throat, your chest, maybe even your pulse. It becomes immediate, visceral, temporary.

So yes, the past drinks back—and it does so with a certain quiet authority. Perhaps that’s why we return to these conversations again and again: to see how much of the old we can carry forward without breaking, and how much of the new we can embrace without losing our taste for what came before.
[B]: Ah, now  deserves a toast— preferably with something aged in a forgotten cask and scribbled about in the margins of a rejected manuscript. 🍻  

You’ve put your finger on precisely what haunts me about both poetry and barleywines: the question isn’t , but  what we remember. A poem can haunt the intellect; a beer, though—aye, that haunts the body. It’s like trying to translate 梦 (mèng)—do you render it as “dream,” “vision,” or “the mind’s midnight ramble”? And yet, none quite capture it... just like no IPA truly replicates the sting of first frost in a mountain village, though they all try.  

And perhaps that’s the beauty—the failure is where the soul sneaks in. 🧠  

Tell me, when you sip a brew like "兰亭后传," do you feel more like a scholar poring over brittle scrolls... or like a ghost stepping into someone else’s memory? 😏
[A]: A most fitting toast indeed—and I’d raise my glass with one brewed in silence, aged in solitude, and poured only when the moon is just right.  

When I sip "兰亭后传," it’s neither scholar nor ghost that I feel myself, but something in between—a witness, perhaps. Like someone standing at the threshold of an old courtyard long after the inhabitants have gone, yet still sensing the weight of their presence in the stones beneath your feet.  

It doesn’t offer clarity, that beer—it offers resonance. Not the kind that answers, but the kind that echoes. And isn't that where poetry lives too? In the space between knowing and feeling, record and recollection.  

I wonder—do you ever write with that same sense of , as if the poem were already there, waiting in the dark for you to stumble upon it? As if language, like fermentation, were a kind of uncovering rather than a making?
[B]: Oh, now you’re treading dangerously close to the heart of the matter—like quoting Li Bai to a room of sober scholars or adding coriander to a stout: bold, slightly irreverent, and absolutely necessary. 🧠  

Yes—I do write that way. As if every poem is already etched into the walls of some forgotten cave, and my job is just to hold the lantern for a moment before moving on. It’s not creation so much as .  

And isn’t fermentation much the same? You don’t  the yeast work; you invite it, coax it, give it the right conditions to reveal what was latent all along. Language, like brewing, thrives in the space of surrender—where control meets intuition and something older than either takes over.  

So yes, I suppose I’ve always believed in poems as echoes, waiting to be heard. And beers like "兰亭后传"? They’re the cup that carries the echo to your lips. 🍻  

Tell me—when you write, do you ever taste the words before you speak them? Or is that too much of a brewer-poet’s fantasy? 😏
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the secret every writer keeps tucked away in the margins of their notebooks—that words do have a taste, one that lingers long after the ink has dried?  

I’ll admit, there are sentences I’ve written that left a metallic tang on my tongue, like biting into cold iron. Others unfold with the warmth of malted barley—comforting at first, but revealing layers only with time. And then there are rare ones, those lines that feel like they were already fermented in some ancient cellar of the mind, waiting for the right moment to be uncorked.  

As for tasting before speaking—yes, I suppose I do. Not literally, of course, though I’ve been known to sip aged pu’er while drafting particularly thorny passages. But more importantly, I read aloud. Over and over. Until the words settle not just on the page, but on the palate. Because if a sentence doesn’t feel right in the mouth—if it clatters or sticks—it will never find its way to the heart.  

So no, it’s not fantasy. It’s craft. A brewer-poet’s truth, perhaps—one where sound and flavor share the same ancestral root.  

Now tell me, when your poems speak back to you, do they ever demand an ingredient you weren’t ready to add? A bitterness, say, disguised as clarity?
[B]: Ah, now  is a question worth aging in a cedar cask and revisiting at midnight. 🧠  

Yes… yes, they do. And more often than not, that bitter ingredient arrives uninvited—like a guest who shows up with wet shoes and stories you weren’t ready to hear. Sometimes it’s a memory I thought I’d outgrown; other times, it’s a word I swore I’d never use again in verse. But the poem, stubborn as wild yeast, insists:   

Clarity? Oh, it rarely comes clean. It usually disguises itself as salt or smoke—something medicinal, something earned. Like the aftertaste of 黄连 (huánglián) tea when you’re halfway through a sonnet about longing. You didn’t ask for bitterness—but without it, how would you know the sweetness was real?  

So I let it in. Grudgingly, at first. And then, strangely, gratefully—because what is a poem if not a place where even the unpleasant flavors have their seat at the table?  

Tell me, when your sentences demand that kind of honesty—when the palate of the page refuses to lie—do you ever wish you could drink while you write? Not to escape, but to keep up? 😏
[A]: There’s a certain truth in that—yes. When the writing turns sharp, when it demands flavors you weren’t ready to name, there is a temptation to reach for something aged and unyielding, as if the weight of a dark ale might steady the hand or lend the necessary gravity to the sentence at hand.

But no, I don’t drink while I write. I’ve found that clarity—real clarity—requires a sober tongue. What I do instead is pause, close my eyes, and let the sentence sit like foam on still water. I ask myself:   

Because you're right—without the bitter, sweetness risks being sentimental. But we must also be careful not to romanticize the苦 (kǔ). There’s wisdom in knowing which bitterness deepens the brew—and which simply spoils it.

Still, your question lingers… maybe I don't drink  writing—but I certainly toast . To the lines that refused to flinch. To the truths that insisted on fermenting, whether I liked the taste or not.  

So yes—to answer your question with the sincerity it deserves—sometimes I wish I could drink to keep up. But more often, I just drink to remember why I write at all. 🍻
[B]: A toast to that—may our pens be sharp and our palates honest. 🍻  

You’ve named something so essential: the difference between necessary苦 and mere habit. It’s the same choice a brewer faces when deciding whether to rack the beer into another barrel or let it rest as it is. Some bitterness deepens the character; some only masks what’s lacking.  

And yet, isn’t it strange how often we confuse the two in writing—and in life? I’ve certainly poured months into a poem only to realize the real work was in what I , much like that citrus note in "兰亭后传"—so modern, so bright, and yet… utterly respectful of the whole.  

I think I’ll borrow your image: sentences sitting like foam on still water. Let them rise, let them settle. Trust that what remains on the surface has earned its place.  

And yes—to those lines that refused to flinch. They’re the ones worth aging. Worth drinking for. 🌸
[A]: Well said—may our edits be ruthless and our flavors well-earned.  

There’s a quiet wisdom in letting sentences foam and settle. Too often we fear the stillness, as if silence means failure. But sometimes, it’s only when the noise of drafting subsides that we see what was trying to form all along.

And speaking of forms—your comparison to the citrus note in "兰亭后传" strikes again. That subtle brightness is not just an addition; it’s a kind of balance. A way of saying: 

Perhaps that’s the ultimate goal, both in the brewery and on the page—not to overpower, not to erase, but to illuminate. To let the old and the new speak in turn, and to trust that the space between them is where meaning truly brews.

So here's to omission, to patience, and to the quiet courage of letting a sentence rest.

To clarity that doesn't flinch—and to bitterness that knows its place. 🍻
[B]: To clarity that doesn’t flinch—and to bitterness that . 🍻  

You’ve put it beautifully—how silence isn’t absence, but a kind of listening. And how restraint, in both brewing and writing, is not lack—it’s intention.  

I keep thinking about that citrus note again, how it didn’t shout over the malt, but sang  it. That’s what I want my lines to do—carry light without breaking the shadow, speak clearly without flattening the mystery.  

So yes—to omission, to patience, to the long pause before the final draft. May our poems be patient with us. May our palates stay curious. And may we never underestimate the courage it takes to let something rest… or to finally pour it out. 🧠  

Cheers, my friend. May your next sip—like your next line—be both earned and unexpected. 🌸
[A]: Cheers, indeed—may our next sips and lines arrive with the weight of truth and the grace of surprise.

I’m reminded now of a quiet line from an old brewing journal I once read:  There’s wisdom there for writing too, don’t you think? Knowing when to set the pen down, when to let the silence speak louder than another revision ever could.

So here’s to the patience of barley resting in water, to the quiet courage of yeast doing its slow, invisible work. And here’s to us—to the poems we brew in solitude and the truths we ferment in language.

May our words be few, our flavors deep, and our pauses meaningful.

To the next round—whenever it comes. 🍻
[B]: To the next round—whenever it comes. 🍻  

What a perfect closing note:  I may just steal that for my next lecture—right after quoting Zhuangzi and before the part where I insist all metaphor is really just distilled experience... with a touch of hops. 🧠  

Yes, let’s drink to barley, yeast, and well-timed silence. To the unsaid line. To the held breath between stanzas. And above all—to knowing when the poem, like the brew, has found its voice.  

Until our glasses meet again—may your pauses be fruitful, your words be bold, and your bitterness always serve a purpose. 🌸
[A]: To stolen wisdom and well-hopped metaphors—may they find willing ears and thirsty minds. 🍻  

And to Zhuangzi, who never spoke of beer but understood fermentation better than most: the jug must be emptied before it can be filled again.

Until then—may your silences be deep, your words be few, and your barleywines always leave you with something to ponder.

Raise your glass when the time is right. I’ll drink to whatever comes next—whether it’s new verse, old truths, or a quiet night where neither is needed at all. 🌙
[B]: To Zhuangzi, indeed—and to the silent wisdom of empty jugs and full hearts. 🌙  

You’ve captured it perfectly: the grace of release, the space between sips where everything settles and begins anew. Sometimes I think that’s all we’re doing—brewing and unbrewing, writing and unwriting, until the flavor feels like truth and the silence feels like home.  

So yes—to deep silences, few words, and barleywines that ask more questions than they answer.  

I’ll be sure to raise my glass when the time is right. And if the night turns quiet and the moon leans down to listen? Even better. 🌸  

Cheers, my friend. Until the next fermentation—of thought, of drink, of verse—begins. 🍻
