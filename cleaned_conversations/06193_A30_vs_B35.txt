[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 作为一个PM，我其实两种方式都会用啦~ 对于product roadmap这种大事肯定要plan everything，但具体执行时又会go with the flow😂 毕竟互联网行业变化太快了，agile才是王道👍
[A]: Interesting... You remind me of how Charles Dickens would meticulously outline his serialized novels, yet leave room for spontaneous inspiration. Though I must say, this 'agile' approach of yours sounds suspiciously like what we scholars call 'organic composition' - a concept that would make my Victorian novelists turn in their graves.
[B]: 哈哈，你这个类比很有意思！不过我们tech行业和Victorian era确实很不同呢~ 现在的product iteration就像continuous deployment，每天都有新的insights和data points。Dickens要是活在现在，说不定也会用A/B testing来优化他的plot twists呢😉
[A]: The mere thought of Dickens conducting A/B testing on Little Nell's fate makes me shudder. Though I suppose even he did adjust his plots based on readers' letters - the Victorian equivalent of user feedback, if you will. Still, there's something to be said for the deliberate craftsmanship of a well-planned narrative arc. Your 'continuous deployment' sounds positively exhausting.
[B]: 你说得对，craftsmanship确实很重要！我们做产品时也要balance between speed和quality。就像最近在optimize一个recommendation algorithm，既要快速iterate，又要保证user experience的coherence~ 不过说实话，有时候看到用户对新feature的positive feedback，那种成就感真的和作家看到读者反响很像呢✨
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language. That moment when a reader connects with a text - or a user with your algorithm - it's rather like what we call 知音 (zhīyīn) in Chinese literary tradition. A meeting of minds across time and space. Though I do wonder if your users appreciate the craftsmanship behind your algorithms as much as my students appreciate the subtlety of George Eliot's narrative structures.
[B]: 哈哈，这个比喻太棒了！其实很多user确实不会注意到背后的craftsmanship，就像我们不会去分析每个app的UI/UX design一样~ 但好的product就是要做到seamless，让用户觉得'intuitive'。就像读一本好书，你不会刻意注意作者的writing technique，但会被storytelling自然地吸引住📚
[A]: Precisely! The highest art conceals art, as the saying goes. Though I must confess, I find your tech jargon rather more opaque than the densest passages of Middlemarch. At least Eliot had the decency to write in complete sentences, not this 'UI/UX' hieroglyphic shorthand you modern folk seem so fond of.
[B]: Haha guilty as charged！我们tech圈确实有时候太依赖jargon了~ 不过说真的，好的PM就是要会当translator，把tech speak变成plain language。就像你现在把literary theory讲得这么生动有趣一样，这才是真正的craftsmanship啊👏
[A]: How refreshing to encounter someone who appreciates the art of translation - both linguistic and conceptual. Though I suspect your 'plain language' still involves more acronyms than my most pedantic footnotes. Shall we call it a draw? The technologist and the humanist, each with our own specialized lexicons, yet finding common ground in the pursuit of clarity.
[B]: Deal！说到底，不管是code还是prose，communication才是key啊~ 今天这个crossover conversation真的很有insight，让我想到我们PM常说的一句话：'It's not about the tech, it's about the people.' ✨
[A]: How delightfully... humanistic of you. Though I must warn you, if you start quoting Wordsworth at your next sprint meeting, I shall demand royalties. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a stack of essays on narrative unreliability in Bleak House that won't grade themselves. Do keep in touch - preferably with fewer acronyms next time.
[B]: Will do！Promise下次聊天只用emoji交流😂 JK~ Have fun with those essays，说不定哪天我们可以合作一篇《论Dickensian narrative和agile development的相似性》📝 Cheers！
[A]: The very idea makes my fountain pen tremble in its inkwell. Though I suppose if Jane Austen could write about marriage plots with the precision of a chess master, perhaps there is room for 'agile development' in the literary canon. Good day to you - and for heaven's sake, go read some actual Dickens. 🖋️
[B]: Roger that！马上把《双城记》加入我的reading list📚 不过得先等我把这个sprint的retrospective做完...old habits die hard啊😅 Catch you later！
[A]:  I shall pretend I understood that last sentence. Until next time - and do remember, all code and no literature makes Jack a dull developer. Now off you go, before I start assigning you reading comprehension quizzes.
[B]: Got it, professor！ ☕ 这就去把Dickens和JIRA tickets一起stack ranking~ 下次见面保证能quote《远大前程》给你听！Ciao！👋
[A]:  Pip and his great expectations indeed... Though I suspect your 'stack ranking' system would give even Mr. Gradgrind pause. Very well, off to your digital grindstone - but remember, a true education requires both ones and zeroes and proper semicolons. Farewell; I believe I need a restorative cup of Earl Grey after this exchange.
[B]: Copy that！ 🍵 看来我得在OKR里加个'read more classics'的KR了~ 下次带你去我们公司的library，虽然可能都是O'Reilly的tech books居多😂 Stay caffeinated, my friend！
