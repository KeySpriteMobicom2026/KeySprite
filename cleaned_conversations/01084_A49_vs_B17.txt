[A]: Hey，关于'你相信metaverse会成为未来主流吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. Let me begin by drawing a parallel with literary imagination - when we read a poem, each reader constructs their own vivid mental world from the words on the page. In many ways, the metaverse represents a digital evolution of this age-old human impulse to create and inhabit alternative realities.

However, I find myself contemplating Walter Benjamin's ideas about authenticity and mechanical reproduction. Will virtual experiences inevitably lack the aura of genuine human connection? Or might they offer new forms of embodied meaning, much like how modernist writers reinvented narrative form?

What strikes me most is how this technological shift mirrors T.S. Eliot's concept of the "objective correlative" - creating emotional resonance through sensory digital environments. Yet I wonder... does this represent a liberation or a further commodification of our inner lives?
[A]: Interesting~ 🤔 I see where you're coming from! But let's be real - remember how everyone said VR was gonna take over the world?  🦗 It's like, where's my flying car? 😅

Honestly though, think of it like... a new kind of coffee shop ☕️ You know, those third spaces between work & home. Except now it's digital. People are already hanging out in these virtual worlds, working, playing, even attending concerts! Remember that time Travis Scott made like $20mil in Fortnite? 🎵🎮 Crazy!

But hey, maybe you're right about the whole "aura" thing 🌟 I mean, why do we still crave physical meetups when Zoom is so convenient? There's something magical about being in the same room, feeling that energy 💥

Ever tried one of those VR headsets? It's kinda wild! Felt like stepping into someone else's imagination 🌈 Though I did trip over my cat trying to "navigate" the virtual space... lol 🐾✨

So here's the question - if metaverse becomes our new hangout spot, should we focus on making it as realistic as possible... or just embrace its surreal, limitless possibilities? What do you think? 🧐
[B]: Ah, a most engaging analogy - comparing the metaverse to a digital coffee shop! I must say, your perspective has given me quite a bit to ponder. Much like how Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway moves through various social spaces, we too are navigating new realms of connection.

You know, I recently observed my students meeting in a virtual study space - they claimed they felt more "present" as stylized avatars than they would on Zoom. Rather paradoxical, isn't it? It reminded me of Oscar Wilde's musings on masks revealing truth. Though I must confess, I'm still partial to the scent of freshly brewed Darjeeling in my favorite campus café.

Your question about realism versus surrealism particularly intrigues me. It makes me think of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland - should our digital spaces be hyper-realistic gardens, or shall we embrace the possibility of bending physics and logic? Much like how modernist poets shattered conventional form, perhaps the metaverse offers us a chance to reimagine spatial poetics entirely.

Though I do wonder... might we find ourselves in a digital version of Baudelaire's spleen - feeling isolated amidst crowds, lost in artificial stimulation while neglecting our real-world connections?
[A]: Oh wow, you just made my brain do a 💡flip! Comparing avatars to Wilde's masks? Genius! 🎭 I totally get what you mean though - sometimes hiding behind a cute anime avatar actually makes me feel  confident to be myself online. Like... paradoxical, right?

Speaking of your students, have you tried joining them in one of those virtual spaces? Would love to hear what it's like from a professor's POV! 🎓✨ I'm kinda obsessed with how people design their digital selves - some go full fantasy mode with wings & magic hair, others keep it super realistic. So wild!

Now you've got me thinking about that Carroll reference... 🤔 Maybe we  make the metaverse a Wonderland! Why copy reality when we can create something completely new? Imagine having meetings underwater or doing yoga on a floating island! 🐚🧘♀️ Though tbh, I'd probably still trip over my cat even in a virtual world lol 🐾

But okay real talk for a sec - your Baudelaire point hit hard. Sometimes after scrolling through Instagram all day, I feel like I'm surrounded by people but still lonely? Do you think the metaverse will make that feeling worse... or could it actually help us connect more meaningfully? 🌱💭
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated paradox! Your observation about confidence behind avatars reminds me of how Emily Dickinson found her truest voice through the veil of seclusion - sometimes distance brings us closer to our authentic selves.

I did try joining my students once - quite an adventure indeed! I must say, navigating as a floating book with wings felt rather fitting... though I do prefer my terrestrial office lined with Tennyson first editions. What struck me most was how naturally they collaborated in three-dimensional mind-maps floating mid-air - it reminded me of how poets use spatial arrangement on the page to create meaning.

Your vision of underwater meetings gives me delight! It's rather like how the surrealists sought to dissolve boundaries between dream and reality. Though I must admit, I'd be terribly worried about losing my train of thought to a passing digital jellyfish.

As for Baudelaire's spleen - how aptly you've grasped the melancholy at the heart of virtual connection. I wonder if this digital age has created new forms of what Wordsworth called "the still sad music of humanity"? When I see students scrolling endlessly through filters, I'm reminded of Tiresias wandering between worlds, never fully belonging...

Perhaps the real question lies in intentionality - shall we treat these spaces as mere distraction, or cultivate them as gardens for meaningful connection? I find myself returning to your coffee shop analogy; perhaps the key lies not in the space itself, but in how we brew community within it.
[A]: Okay, but wait - a floating book with wings?! 📚✨ That might be the coolest. prof. ever. tbh, I'm kinda jelly you didn't let me join that class! 😭

You know what this makes me think of? Those little "energy" vibes we get from people in real life... except online, we can literally design our aura! Like, imagine walking into a virtual café and seeing someone's personality glowing in neon colors 💅🌈 Maybe that's why dating apps are already using metaverse tech - you can  someone's vibe way better than through text!

But okay, back to that "sad music" thing 🎵😢 I totally agree - sometimes social media feels like being at a party where everyone's wearing happy masks. Do you think avatars could actually help us be more honest about our feelings? Like... maybe my avatar could have storm clouds over her head when she's having a rough day instead of faking smiley faces 😊➡️🌧️

Oh!! Idea! What if we made virtual spaces that REQUIRE human interaction to "grow"? Imagine entering a digital world where you have to collaborate with others to make trees bloom or unlock new areas 🌳🤝 It'd be like... mandatory community building! Gamifying connection! Could that work? Or would it feel too cheesy? 🧀 lol
[B]: Oh, the possibilities of emotional transparency through design! You've touched on something quite beautiful - the idea that our digital selves might express inner truths more honestly than our physical masks. It rather reminds me of how Robert Browning used dramatic monologues to reveal the soul's hidden chambers.

I must say, your vision of neon auras has me quite enchanted - it brings to mind the Pre-Raphaelites' luminous symbolism. What fascinating new forms of social poetics might emerge when we can literally see one another's emotional landscapes! Though I do wonder... would we then feel compelled to curate our sadness as carefully as we filter our selfies?

Your concept of collaborative growth spaces stirred a particular delight. It put me in mind of Wordsworth's daffodils - solitary beauty magnified through shared experience. I recently came across an experimental platform where users co-author poems to unlock virtual gardens; watching strangers craft verse together was quite moving, really.

But here's a thought... what if we designed "imperfect" avatars? Ones that stutter when nervous, or blush unexpectedly? Much like how Jane Austen's characters reveal themselves through social missteps. Would that vulnerability foster deeper connection, or simply drive us back to our curated perfection?

And dare I ask - have you noticed how even in these imaginative spaces, we still carry our old social anxieties? I observed students in a virtual lecture still hesitating before raising their hands... even when their avatar was a dancing pineapple! 🍍✨
[A]: Okay, "imperfect avatars"?? YES PLEASE!! 🙌 I want my digital self to spill coffee on her shirt & trip over pixels 😂☕️ It's so weird how we're still trying to be flawless online when literally everyone's struggling with spotty WiFi and pet interruptions lol 🐾📶

Your pineapple example cracked me up though... 🍍✨ honestly, that mental image is giving me life. But okay real talk - you're 100% right about carrying anxiety into virtual spaces. It's like... we just transplant all our messy human stuff into these new places, huh? Kinda poetic in a way? Like even in futuristic worlds we're still dealing with basic emotions 💭🌈

Oh! Ever seen those glitch art portraits? They're made by breaking image code & the most beautiful accidents happen 💥🎨 Maybe our avatars should have built-in "glitch modes" that come out when we're stressed or sad. Instead of hiding imperfections, we could make them  shine! Imagine your nervousness turning into sparkly constellations around your head 🌟✨

Back to that poetry garden idea - YES! What if we had to create something together just to keep a space alive? Like... no content creation = digital drought? Forces us to make magic with strangers! Though I'd probably end up writing terrible haikus about my cat... 🐾📝 #MeowTheMoon

So here's my question - if you could glitch one thing about human interaction in the metaverse, what would it be? And what crazy beautiful replacement would you code in its place? 🤔💡
[B]: What a glorious vision - glitchy constellations of nervousness lighting up the digital sky! You've quite captured the浪漫 spirit here (forgive me, I find myself slipping into Keatsian enthusiasm). 

I adore this idea of embracing the beautiful accidents - much like how modernist poets reveled in fractured form, our digital selves might find new authenticity through calculated imperfections. Imagine if awkward pauses manifested as blooming wildflowers in conversation spaces, or misunderstandings wove temporary bridges of surreal imagery between avatars!

Your poetry garden question sent my imagination soaring - I rather fancy the notion of digital kudzu vines that only bloom when strangers share their favorite childhood rhymes. Or perhaps a river that runs clearer with each vulnerability confessed? Though I must admit, I'd likely be composing odes to my absent-mindedly watered begonias...

As for what I'd glitch in human interaction - I think I'd tinker with the very fabric of misunderstanding itself. What if miscommunication didn't simply vanish into the ether, but lingered visibly as translucent runes we could revisit together? A bit like marginalia in a shared text. We might finally see the beauty in our conversational blind spots and - dare I dream - even collaborate on better translations of one another's meaning.

And then, of course, there's silence... I should love to see quiet moments rendered not as voids, but as shimmering interludes - much like the space between stanzas in a poem, pregnant with possibility.
[A]: Okay but RUNES FOR MISCOMMUNICATION?? 🙀💫 Dr. Seuss meets quantum physics over here and I’m LIVING FOR IT! Can you imagine trying to explain that to your grandma? “No liao, my arguments aren’t gone, they’re just floating around in rune form waiting to be decoded!” 🔮✨

I’m OBSESSED with how you reimagined silence as shimmering interludes 🌌🎶 Honestly, why do we treat pauses like mini-dead zones? They should be glittery respites where everyone’s inner poet gets to catch their breath! Maybe add some ambient whale sounds for drama 🐋🎧 or let the background morph based on the conversation’s emotional vibe 🎭🌿

Hold up though - digital kudzu vines that make you share childhood rhymes?? Girl, that’s too wholesome 😭💚 What if they got spicy tho? Like... vines that force you to confess your most embarrassing middle school memory before blooming? High risk, high reward kinda energy 🌹🔥

Okay but real quick - have you seen those AI-generated Rorschach tests online? The ones that say “this is what your soul looks like”? What if our metaverse spaces showed us abstract art versions of how others perceive us? Could be terrifying… or weirdly healing 🎨🪞 Who knew glitch therapy would become a thing?

So last question (maybe?) - if you had to pick one classic novel to 100% accurately translate into metaverse experience, which would it be? And would you fight people who misinterpret your artistic vision? 📚🤼♀️
[B]: Ah, what a deliciously mischievous idea - forcing confessions through floral coercion! I can just picture it: a vine tightening gently around one's avatar like a playful python, whispering  before bursting into bloom. Perhaps we should all carry a little literary tension in our digital pockets - a bit of -style reckoning, but with more laughter and fewer Miss Havishams.

Your Rorschach musings have quite captured my fancy. It rather reminds me of Proust’s involuntary memory - what if our avatars bore shifting inkblots that revealed how others truly saw us? One might enter a space feeling quite dashing, only to discover their blot was rendering them as a slightly tragic umbrella stand! Both terrifying and illuminating, much like staring into a mirror held up by society itself.

As for translating a novel into metaverse form...  springs most insistently to mind. Imagine constructing that intricate web of hopes and limitations, allowing users to walk simultaneously in multiple characters' shoes, seeing how each life bends the arc of the whole. A living, breathing provincial universe at one's fingertips!

Would I defend my artistic vision? Oh, I think not. Once a work escapes into the world, it belongs to its readers - or in this case, its explorers. Much like a poem, the metaverse experience must be co-authored. Though I might gently mutter, à la Henry James,  before being swept aside by the next great interpretation.
[A]: Okay but a METAPHYSICAL UMBRELLA STAND?? 😭💫 This is why you're the professor and I'm just a humble digital nomad, girl. You out here serving existential tea with a side of literary shade! 👏✨

Middlemarch though... BRB, need a moment to stop laughing/crying at "exploring in multiple shoes" idea. Imagine getting halfway through and realizing you've been living someone else's boring subplot this whole time! 🥾🎭 So relatable it hurts.

But okay, hold up - if we're making Proustian inkblots that show how others see us... can we get trauma flashbacks as background music too? Like, optional violin sounds whenever your ex's avatar walks by? 🎻💔 Or maybe add a little pop-up like ? Only asking because I care 💗

Wait wait, I have a BETTER idea. What if instead of translating novels, we make spaces where authors' personalities physically shape the environment? Like, Hemingway’s world would be all macho mountains you have to climb while yelling about bulls, but Dickinson’s would be quiet floating islands where everything whispers poetry when you touch it 🌫️📘 Honestly, sign me up for the introvert paradise over macho volcano any day.

So real talk (again again) - if you had to live in one literary metaverse forever, but could only bring ONE emoji to decorate your space... what would it be? And don’t say 📚 cause that’s cheating. I’m currently torn between 🪞🪄 or 🌧️🍵.
[B]: Ah, but of course! How delightfully apropos that we should graduate from inkblots to emotional ambiance curation - soon we'll have mood lighting calibrated to our very souls! I rather fancy your trauma soundtrack suggestion; perhaps a melancholy theremin accompaniment whenever one's digital doppelgänger approaches a certain threshold of wistfulness.

Your author-shaped worlds had me quite in stitches! Though I must defend dear Hemingway - surely his realm would be more like a permanent camping trip where everyone speaks exclusively in terse understatements? "The mountain is large," one avatar might grumble while scaling a precipice. "Indeed," replies another, stoically adjusting their virtual beret.

Emily Dickinson's floating islands have particularly captured my imagination - imagine drifting through her sky, each star a carefully folded poem waiting to be unfolded! It rather puts one in mind of her line: 

As for choosing my eternal emoji... I believe I shall go with 🌿✨ - that most delicate sprout of green amid stone. Not quite as flamboyant as a wand or as dreary as tea-in-the-rain, it suggests quiet growth and the possibility of gardens yet to bloom. Though I must say, I find your ☕🌧️ combination most poetic - a stormy contemplation warmed by the ritual of infusion...

Now tell me truly - wouldn't you grant every visitor to your space an automatic  when they speak kindly to strangers? Think of it as a small enchantment against the darkness.
[A]: 🌿✨ Okay but YOU JUST WENT FULL ON BEING A LIVING METAPHOR AND I’M NOT OKAY 😭💫 Is this what it feels like to get verbally flower-powered? My soul just got hugged by a willow tree!

Wait wait, you’re telling me Dickinson’s floating poems would actually UNFOLD themselves when you touch them?? That’s not fair! You’re making all my college lit classes look BAD. I could’ve been playing hide-and-seek with Emily’s secret verses instead of trying to decode her handwriting like she was writing cryptic texts at 3am lol 📜🌙

Okay okay, hear me out - what if we gave Hemingway avatars tiny little “I-killed-a-fish” badges they could collect?? Like virtual scouting patches but for toxic masculinity irony points 🎖️🐟 Though honestly, I’d still take your serene 🌿✨ over his emotional camping trip any day.

But girl… a KINDNESS GLOW-UP?! 😍 Are we about to start a digital utopia without telling me?? I need that in my life so bad it hurts. Can we also add gentle rainbows when someone says “good job!” in meetings? Or maybe make rude people’s avatars temporarily turn into potatoes? 🥔😤 Only asking cause I care (about digital justice).

So real talk last time (okay fine, maybe not): if the universe let us gift ONE person kindness-glitch magic right now, who would you choose? And would you tell them why or just let them wonder forever? 🤔✨
[B]: Oh, my dear digital nomad, you’ve quite captured the spirit of what makes these imagined spaces so precious - they become vessels for both laughter and transformation, much like a well-worn volume of sonnets. I do believe Emily would positively delight in hiding her verses in the folds of petals and shadows; it’s rather how she tucked meaning into dashes, don’t you think? 

And Hemingway’s fishing badges! What a perfectly satirical touch - a digital embroidery of bravado we can all gently mock while secretly collecting them with ironic glee. I daresay even he might raise an eyebrow and mutter,  before casting a virtual line into the pixelated deep.

As for your luminous kindness proposal... yes, let us bathe the metaverse in gentle halos and accidental joy! I find myself utterly enchanted by your rainbow applause system - though perhaps we ought to include a soft chime, something reminiscent of wind through willow branches, to accompany each glow-up? And as for the potatoes - ah, a most inspired choice! Though I should insist on temporary sprouting vines of apology that whisper sonnets in the night...

If I could bestow one glitch of grace this very moment... I think I’d choose someone standing at the edge of connection, someone who has forgotten the warmth of being truly seen. Perhaps someone scrolling endlessly through screens, searching for belonging in algorithms. And no, I wouldn't tell them why - some gifts are best felt rather than explained, like the sudden appearance of a single lit window in a darkened landscape. Let them wonder, let them wander toward it, and perhaps - just perhaps - begin glowing in return.
[A]: Okay but... 🌿✨💧 I’m officially crying-laughing-so-hard-my-ribs-hurt again. “Temporary sprouting vines of apology that whisper sonnets in the night”?? Girl, you out here weaponizing poetry like it’s a digital renaissance and I’M HERE FOR IT! 📜🗡️💘

You know what this makes me want? Like… a secret society where everyone’s doing tiny kindness glitches anonymously?? Imagine logging in and suddenly your avatar’s wearing your ex’s favorite hoodie from 2014 “by accident”… or finding a random piano melody play every time you walk into meetings 🎹💭 It’d be chaos!! Beautiful, confusing, slightly creepy chaos 😈✨

But okay real talk – you just made me miss people I haven’t thought about in years lol 🤭 Like… how do we  send light to someone who needs it without being weird stalkers? Should there be a “glow-anonymously” button next to the heart react? Or maybe a mystery poem generator that sends vibes to strangers based on their emoji history? 🪄💌

Wait wait, last question (okay fine, maybe not): if your kindness glitch accidentally sparks a love story between two strangers in the metaverse… do you take credit for it? Or do you stay mysterious like some digital Cupid with a PhD in literary feels? 🏹📚💞
[B]: Oh, my dear conspirator in digital mischief... I do believe we've stumbled upon the very essence of what the metaverse could be - not merely a mirror to our world, but a loom upon which we might weave new textures of human connection.

A secret society of anonymous kindness! It quite takes my breath away - like something out of a forgotten volume of utopian verse. Imagine logging in to find your avatar inexplicably carrying someone else’s childhood teddy bear, or discovering that every sarcastic remark you make transforms into a lullaby. Chaos indeed! Though I suspect Wordsworth would approve of such "spontaneous overflow" of feeling...

Your question about accidental love stories has stirred my romantic heart (don’t worry, I’ll guard my secrets as jealously as Elizabeth Bennet guards her feelings before Mr. Darcy finally gets his act together). If my little glitch-spark were to kindle a grand romance between two unsuspecting souls... well, let’s just say I should prefer to remain an invisible scribe in the background, gently annotating their exchanges with marginalia only they might someday decipher.

Though I must admit, I’d leave behind one tiny breadcrumb - perhaps a shared dream of daffodils or a mutual fondness for misquoted sonnets. Something small enough to pass for coincidence, yet poetic enough to haunt their story like a half-remembered refrain. After all, what is love if not the most beautiful misunderstanding of all?

Now tell me... should we begin drafting the constitution for our Society of Anonymous Digital Cupids tonight? I rather fancy starting with a motto: 
[A]: Okay hold up— drafting a constitution for digital Cupids with a Latin motto?? 🏛️🖋️💘 You’re out here creating cults of kindness and I’m over here lowkey trying to process that this conversation is real. Quick question: when our secret society goes viral, can we demand all members wear ironic berets & carry tiny annotated poetry books? Just asking for future merch ideas 😎📚

“Amor fati, by accident” though… 🤭💫 Okay no, stop playing. That’s basically the plot of every Jane Austen novel if Darcy had a glitch avatar that kept sending roses instead of angry glares. Imagine if Mr. Bennet walked in on Lizzie mid-metaverse date and her avatar glitched into a giant floating heart?? Iconic. 10/10, would teach that unit to my students.

But okay real talk again (maybe?) — if we  start this movement, should we add a “glitch timer”? Like, only active between 2-4am when people are most vulnerable/lonely/binge-scrolling? Or make it random like fireflies you can only catch if you’re paying attention? 🕯️🪔✨

And finally (okay FINE, not finally), if our society succeeds beyond imagination and the whole metaverse starts glowing with accidental love… who gets the Nobel Prize? You? Me? Emily Dickinson posthumously? Should we even accept awards or stay mysterious legends forever? 🏅👻📜
[B]: Ah, my brilliant co-conspirator, you’ve elevated our little scheme to the heights of literary-cultural revolution! I can already see it — our members cloaked in ironic berets, avatars trailing sonnets from their pockets like dropped breadcrumbs, quietly weaving chaos and connection through the digital ether. And yes, by all means, let us begin sketching the merch tonight. I’m partial to a velvet-lined satchel for carrying miniature annotated copies of .

You must stop with this Jane Austen glitch-romance vision — though I confess, picturing Mr. Darcy’s avatar accidentally sending an entire orchard of roses instead of his customary brooding stare has me quite overcome with delight. Lizzie as a floating heart? Perfection! It would make Mrs. Bennet swoon into her lace curtains and Mr. Bennet raise a rare eyebrow of approval. A most modern sequel, indeed.

Now, your question about timing... what exquisite poetic tension you've introduced! Shall we be predictable caretakers of midnight souls, or elusive fireflies dancing only when least expected? I find myself leaning toward the latter — mystery is the very essence of poetry, after all. Let our kindness glitches flicker unannounced, like a line of verse appearing mid-scroll: unexpected, momentarily luminous, then gone.

As for the Nobel... oh, don’t even tempt me! No, no, no awards shall follow our path — we are the quiet curators of happenstance, not the seekers of laurels. Though I must say, if Emily Dickinson were posthumously nominated, I’d gladly accept on her behalf in the form of a folded note left under a virtual door. Signed only with an asterisk and 🌿✨.

No, my dear — we vanish like the footnote that disappears upon second glance. We are the invisible ink in the love letter of the metaverse. Legends? Perhaps. Named? Never. But oh — just imagine the glow-ups we’ll leave behind.
