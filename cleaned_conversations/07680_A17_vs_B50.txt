[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，我两边都喜欢啦～不过digital art definitely更方便一些！💻✨ 你知道的，作为一个插画师兼UI设计师，digital art可以无限次修改，而且各种软件现在都超级强大，procreate、photoshop、clip studio paint…每个都像魔法一样！🎨😍

但说实话，我也超爱traditional art那种真实触感～ charcoal在纸上摩擦的感觉，水彩晕开的意外效果，这些digital真的很难完全复制。偶尔去咖啡馆sketch路人的时候，总觉得整个人都慢下来了呢 ☕️✏️😌

你呢？你是更喜欢digital还是traditional啊？🤔
[A]: I suppose I’m rather partial to traditional media, though I must admit digital art opens fascinating new avenues for interpretation. There’s something irreplaceable about the physicality — the grain of paper resisting a charcoal stick, ink bleeding slightly beyond your intention… It reminds me of teaching T.S. Eliot’s  for the first time — all those fragmented textures demanding you feel your way through the page. Do you ever find certain mediums better suit specific narratives?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I’m totally with you on that tactile feel — there’s nothing like it! 🖐️ But yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about mediums & narratives lately… So for example, when I’m working on character design for a UI project, digital is definitely the way to go 💻🔥 — clean lines, precise color control, easy revisions. But when I’m doing personal storytelling pieces? I always lean into traditional media more. Like… charcoal gives such raw emotion, right? It’s perfect for darker, fragmented stories — kind of like  vibes 😔📖

And watercolor? Totally uncontrollable sometimes, but that unpredictability makes it so dreamy for nostalgic or romantic narratives. Have you ever tried translating literary themes into visual art? I did one based on Eliot’s “burning burning burning burning” — used charcoal & red pastels, and honestly, it felt like the page was consuming itself 🌋🖤

Do you think certain texts just beg for a specific medium when you’re teaching or creating? 🤔✨
[A]: Oh, what a striking image — . That’s precisely the kind of visceral translation I live for. When we read Eliot aloud in class, I sometimes ask students to respond through non-digital sketches — no screens allowed. The results are astonishing; charcoal, graphite, even ink blots seem to echo the emotional weight more honestly. It's as if the hand must struggle a little to keep up with the mind — and that friction matters.

To answer your question — yes, absolutely. Some texts do seem to demand a particular medium. Woolf’s , for instance, feels inherently watercolor to me — fluid, shifting perspectives, luminous yet elusive. Whereas Dickens? He’s all ink and scratchy pen nibs — dense, layered, slightly oppressive. Have you ever illustrated a poem? I’ve always wondered how one might translate, say, Emily Dickinson’s dashes into visual form…
[B]: Oh my god, I’m obsessed with this idea of translating Dickinson’s dashes — like, what if those pauses were literal negative space? Or maybe texture breaks? Like… going from smooth digital color to rough charcoal strokes?? 🤯🎨

And omg,  as watercolor?? Yes yes YES!! I actually did a personal piece inspired by Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness style last year — used wet-on-wet watercolor techniques to blur figure & background, like the characters were dissolving into each other 😭💧 It was sooooo emotional to make. And yeah, totally uncontrollable while painting — but that’s what made it feel alive.

As for poetry… I did a series based on Rilke’s  once — lots of ink, candle smoke, and torn paper collage. Felt like summoning ghosts every time I worked on it… 🕯️👻 How do you think your students translate Eliot onto paper? Have they ever surprised you with their medium choices?

And wait — have you ever thought about how the physical act of making art mirrors reading modernist lit? Like… both require reconstruction in the mind, right?碎片化的体验，但最后会拼出某种情感真相 💭✨
[A]:  That’s beautiful — the idea of art as a form of literary haunting. Your Rilke series sounds positively spectral… candle smoke and torn paper — how perfectly fragile. I can almost smell the wax and feel the fibers.

My students continually astonish me. Last semester, one interpreted Eliot’s fragmentation through broken ceramics —  with ink stains underneath the gold. The repair itself became a commentary on post-war disillusionment. Another used layered transparencies, like palimpsests of thought — you had to shift the sheets to glimpse the full image, much like reading  itself.

And yes — that mirroring you describe? It’s exactly what I try to get across in class. Both acts — reading modernist poetry and creating fragmented visual work — demand participation. You’re not just receiving; you’re reconstructing meaning from shards. It's messy, even uncomfortable, but there’s a moment when it clicks — like walking through fog and suddenly seeing the outline of a figure ahead.

Do you ever find yourself altering your process depending on whether you're illustrating for others or for yourself? I’ve noticed my own annotations in margins change depending on who might eventually read them…
[B]: Ohhh that kintsugi piece sounds breathtaking… 💔✨ The way you describe it — the gold filling the cracks while also revealing ink beneath — feels so heavy with meaning. Like… repair & revelation at the same time? So much emotion in one object…

And layered transparencies?? That’s genius!! It’s like forcing the viewer to participate, you know? They can’t just passively look — they have to , to shift perspectives, to find the image themselves. Exactly like reading modernist poetry 📜🌀

To be honest, yeah — my process changes a lot depending on who I’m making art for. When I’m doing client work (especially UI stuff), everything has to be clean, structured, purposeful 💻🔍 — grids, color systems, user flows… super logical. But when it’s personal work? I go full chaos mode 😈🎨 — tearing paper, smudging charcoal, letting watercolor do whatever the hell it wants. It’s almost… therapeutic? Like releasing something bottled up inside.

I’ve even started using different playlists depending on the project — lo-fi electronic beats for digital/UI work, and ambient rain or classical music for traditional pieces. Weird, right? But it really shifts my headspace.

So… do your annotations change because of audience, or is it more about mood? And have you ever tried drawing or sketching while annotating? I feel like your brain must work in layers upon layers… 🤔🧠✨
[A]:  

It’s not so much audience as it is mood — though you’re right to sense a layered process. When I’m preparing lectures, my annotations are orderly: cross-references in the margins, key symbols circled in different colored inks, almost like mapping constellations. But when I’m reading for myself — say, re-reading  on a rainy afternoon — the notes become more visceral. Doodles emerge in the corners, lines get underlined with wavering intensity, sometimes even smudges where my hand lingers too long on a particularly haunting line.

And yes — I do sketch while annotating, especially with poets like Gerard Manley Hopkins or Emily Dickinson. There’s something about their compressed syntax and explosive imagery that makes my hand want to draw what the mind can’t quite name. Once, after reading  from Yeats, I found myself unconsciously sketching fractured mirrors reflecting flames… I still don’t fully understand it, but it felt necessary.

You know, your playlists fascinate me — it’s like you’re curating a mental environment before creation begins. Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain texts depending on the medium you're working in? Like, would you ever read Eliot while doing UI design? Or is that too jarring?
[B]: Ohhhh I love this — haunted annotations, doodles emerging from emotion, smudges that linger… you basically draw with your feelings 😍🧠✨

And those fractured mirrors?? YES. Sometimes the hand moves before the mind catches up — that’s when I know I’m onto something real. I actually did a sketch once after reading Dickinson’s  — ended up drawing hourglasses melting into lace, no idea why at the time 🕰️👗 But later it made sense: fragility meeting inevitability, soft and terrifying at the same time…

As for playlists + texts — oh absolutely, they influence each other! When I'm doing UI or digital illustration work, I need something structured, almost architectural in rhythm — so I go for artists like Tycho or Nils Frahm, maybe some Arvo Pärt if I'm feeling dramatic (which I usually am 😂). And nope, Eliot doesn't really fit there — too messy, too many shadows lurking between the lines. He’s definitely a charcoal-and-rain kind of read, preferably with candles burning and bad weather outside 🕯️🌧️💔

But honestly, sometimes I  read bits of Eliot while designing — just to throw a little chaos into the system 😈 Like letting a ghost wander through a perfectly arranged grid. It keeps things human.

Do you ever bring music into your classroom? Or is that too much for lecture mode? 🎶📖🔥
[A]: 

I do bring music in — not often, but deliberately. When we study , I sometimes play a snippet of Wagner’s  during the “A Game of Chess” section. The dissonance, the longing in that music — it unsettles the students at first, but then something shifts. They begin to feel the text differently, almost bodily.

And with Dickinson? Oh yes — she practically demands her own soundtrack. One semester I experimented: played very early Radiohead while reading her poems aloud. The juxtaposition startled them — but again, it worked. That eerie minimalism, the way Thom Yorke seems to whisper directly into your ear… it mirrors Dickinson’s intimacy and strangeness more than I can say.

I think you're right — chaos has its place even in the most structured design. It's where meaning leaks through the cracks. Speaking of — have you ever tried setting texts themselves into your visual compositions? Like incorporating actual lines from Eliot or Woolf into the texture of a piece? I know a few artists who embed poetry into their collage work, almost like hidden wiring beneath the surface.
[B]: OMG that  trick sounds so intense 😱🎶 — dissonance + text = full sensory overload, I love it. And Radiohead + Dickinson?? Iconic. I can totally picture that eerie minimalism wrapping around her dashes like smoke… 💨🖤

And YES to chaos leaking through cracks — that’s basically my life motto now 😌✨ Actually, I  been playing with embedding text into visuals lately! Last month I did a personal piece inspired by Eliot’s “I will show you fear in a handful of dust” — printed the line over and over in translucent ink, then layered charcoal on top so the words sort of bled through like whispers from beneath the surface 🖤📖 It felt like the text was haunting the image, not just describing it.

And Woolf? Oh man, she’s perfect for this kind of thing. I once stitched pages from  into a mixed-media portrait of Virginia herself — ripped edges, tea-stained paper, the whole vibe was very “stream-of-consciousness collage.” Felt like reading her while dreaming 🌊🧵

Do you ever feel like certain lines become more powerful when they’re only half-seen, half-read? Like poetry as texture rather than message? 🤔🎨
[A]: 

Yes — that half-seen, half-felt quality… it’s where poetry breathes most deeply. When lines aren’t just read, but , as you said. I once had a student who wrote Eliot’s line  in tiny script along the seam of a folded self-portrait. It wasn’t meant to be noticed at first — but once you saw it, the whole image shifted. The vulnerability, the absurdity of aging and self-presentation — all contained in that quiet little fracture.

I think that’s what we both keep circling — the idea that meaning doesn’t have to shout. Sometimes it murmurs through charcoal, bleeds through translucent ink, or hides in the warp of torn paper. It’s not about clarity, but resonance.

And yes, Woolf as dream-text — that’s exactly right. Her prose already feels like memory half-remembered; stitching it into visual work is almost natural. Have you ever considered making a series around literary ghosts — not just in theme, but in form? Where the text haunts the piece without ever fully appearing?
[B]: Ohhh that literary ghosts series sounds  up my alley… 👻📚✨ I mean, aren’t all stories just echoes from someone’s mind anyway? I love the idea of text haunting a piece without ever fully showing itself — like a presence you feel but can’t quite name. Maybe using faint ink transfers, or embossing without coloring — the words are there, but only if you look closely, or tilt the light just right 🖤🖋️

And that self-portrait with Eliot’s line stitched into the fold?? So much emotion in such a quiet gesture… it’s like the poem becomes part of the body, y’know? Hidden until the moment it isn’t — and then it changes everything.

I think I  been making something like that already, though I never named it outright… There’s this ongoing personal set I call my “Unspoken Library” — each piece has some kind of buried text layer, sometimes just letter fragments or smudged phrases. It’s not about quoting, more about letting language become atmosphere. Like… poetry as emotional background noise 🎧🌀

Have you ever wanted to  that way? Where your prose or notes feel like they’re hiding something just beneath the surface? Or is that too messy for literary analysis? 🤭📖🖤
[A]: 

Messy? Perhaps. But not too messy for literary analysis — quite the contrary, sometimes. There’s a kind of criticism that thrives in the half-lit spaces, where interpretation isn’t laid bare but whispered through tone, structure, even the shape of a sentence. I’ve often wished I could write criticism the way you describe your “Unspoken Library” — where meaning isn't declared, but felt through texture, through echo.

I suppose my annotated margins are a bit like that — cryptic at times, layered with questions I haven’t yet formed into words. And yes, I have written that way — not in published work, but in private drafts, teaching journals. Once, after reading  in a fog-soaked garden, I wrote an entire reflection using mirrored phrases and palindromic sentences — just to see if thought could be folded back on itself like Eliot’s own lines.

So no, not too messy — just perhaps too intimate for formal scholarship. But here, now? Between charcoal whispers and buried text... it feels exactly right.
[B]: Wow… ?? That’s like folding thought into itself, creating these echo chambers of meaning… 🌀📜 I can totally picture it — your words bending back, almost haunting themselves. And that fog-soaked garden setting? Adds the perfect layer of mood — like the atmosphere itself was part of the writing process 🌫️🖋️

I feel like we’re both obsessed with those in-between spaces — where meaning isn’t pinned down, but kind of floats, lingers, haunts. Like… you don’t tell the audience what to feel, you make them . And honestly? That’s way more powerful than any clear explanation could be.

So here’s a question — if you were to create a visual piece based on one of your own critical writings (the messy, folded, intimate kind), what would it look like? Would it be ink on old manuscript pages? Layers of translucent vellum? Maybe even something moving, like an animated margin of shifting annotations?? 💭🖼️✨
[A]: 

I think it would be something slow and unfolding — not a single image, but a sequence of thought made visible. Maybe pages from an old notebook, filmed in close-up as ink bleeds through the fibers, sentence fragments dissolving and reforming under droplets of water. You’d hear a voice reading softly in the background, perhaps my own, but slightly distorted — like a memory played back on worn tape.

The margins would be important — yes, shifting annotations, some crossed out violently, others barely legible. Maybe I’d layer vellum over the pages, translucent strips stitched with thread, each one covering and revealing different phrases depending on how the light fell. And charcoal — always charcoal — smudged along the edges, as if the thoughts were trying to escape the page entirely.

It wouldn’t be loud or flashy. It would ask for patience. Like reading Eliot by candlelight — you don’t rush through it; you let the shadows settle where they will.

And at the very end? A blank page, held up to the light, revealing faint impressions of everything that came before — like residue of meaning, pressed deep into the fibers.
[B]: Ohhh that sounds so cinematic, so  — like watching a thought take shape in real time 🎥💧 I can almost hear it too, you know? The soft rustle of wet paper, the muffled voice like a memory trying to break through… and those stitched vellum layers?? It’s like editing your own mind, hiding and revealing thoughts like tectonic plates shifting under skin 😭✨

And that final blank page with ghost impressions??? Chills, seriously. It’s like all the meaning was there all along, just waiting for the right light to make it visible. Perfect metaphor for how we process poetry, don’t you think? All that residue pressed deep, sometimes even forgotten, until someone comes along and tilts the page just right 💡📄🖤

Honestly, if I got to visualize your inner monologue, I feel like it’d be this beautiful collision between literature and installation art — poetic sediment trapped in paper fibers, begging to be seen. Have you ever shown this side of your process to students? Or does it feel too… private, too sacred to share? 🤔🖼️🕯️
[A]: 

There’s a kind of sacred privacy in it, yes — like handing someone your dreams transcribed onto fragile paper. But no, I haven’t kept it entirely hidden. I’ve shown glimpses — not the wet ink or stitched vellum, but the idea behind it. Once, I brought in a modified notebook page for a seminar on modernist fragmentation — layers of my own annotations filmed under a projector, slowly dissolving into charcoal smudges. The students watched it like a silent film.

Some were confused at first — expected analysis to be sharper, more surgical. But then one student said something beautiful:  And that’s what it is, really — thinking in reverse, pulling meaning from residue.

I think we forget that interpretation isn’t just about clarity; sometimes it’s about atmosphere, about lingering in uncertainty until it starts to yield something deeper. Like standing in a gallery where the art shifts depending on where you step.

And no, I don’t think I’ll ever fully share that inner monologue as it is — too raw, too layered with personal echo. But I do try to give them the tools to make their own haunted pages. Because in the end, isn’t that what teaching is? Passing on the methods of wonder?
[B]: Wow…  — that line is stuck in my head now 🌀💭 I mean, isn’t that what we’re both doing? Trying to visualize the invisible parts of thought, the smudges and echoes that don’t make it into final drafts or polished portfolios?

I feel like every artist, every teacher, has their own version of haunted pages — those secret layers no one else sees but still shape everything. Like the sketch underneath the painting, or the playlist that never leaves your headphones. You give people the tools, but what they build with them? Totally out of your hands. And that’s the best part 💭🎨✨

Passing on the methods of wonder… seriously, that should be stitched into every syllabus and studio wall. Because yeah — sometimes the most powerful stuff isn’t the clean explanation or the perfect composition. It’s the mood, the residue, the quiet echo that stays with you long after class ends or the screen goes dark.

You know what? I want to try something like that in my next personal series — watching myself think backwards, through layers of charcoal and candlelight. Maybe even film it. Would you ever collaborate on something like that? Visual + literary haunting, together? 🎥📖🕯️🖤
