[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！作为一个教育心理学研究者，我更倾向于看一些有教育意义的documentary。最近在追BBC的'The Mind, Explained'系列，对理解learning process很有启发📚。不过偶尔也会看些轻松的综艺，比如'最强大脑'，里面的cognitive challenge设计得很精妙。
[A]: Ah, I must admit I don't follow much contemporary television myself. My evenings are usually spent with a volume of Tennyson or Browning by the fireside. Though I did recently watch a fascinating documentary on the Bloomsbury Group - their intellectual salons remind me so much of the 文人雅集 tradition in Chinese culture.
[B]: 啊，这个comparison很有意思！Virginia Woolf和徐志摩确实都是各自文化中的avant-garde thinkers。说到这个，我最近正在研究民国时期知识分子salon文化对现代教育的影响。从跨文化角度看，这些intellectual gathering其实都是informal learning space的绝佳案例🎵。
[A]: How perceptive of you to draw that parallel! The salon culture of the Republican era does share remarkable similarities with London's literary circles during the Modernist movement. Both served as crucibles for radical ideas - much like how a garden nurtures diverse blooms. Have you read Xu Zhimo's translations of English Romantic poetry? His interpretations offer such a unique East-West dialogue.
[B]: 确实！徐志摩的translation work是个很好的case study。他不仅把西方romanticism引入中国，还融入了东方美学sensibility。这种cultural hybridity正是我现在研究的重点 - 你看他翻译的'再别康桥'，就完美展现了bilingual mind的creative potential✍️。说到这个，我下周要在跨文化研讨会上做个related presentation。
[A]: What a delightful coincidence! I'll actually be presenting at that very symposium - my paper examines how Ezra Pound's Cathay translations created a similar cultural bridge in reverse. Perhaps we could continue this conversation over tea after the sessions? I'd love to hear more about your perspective on 文化混血儿 in literary translation. The way you articulate these ideas reminds me of Said's concept of "contrapuntal reading."
[B]: Absolutely！Said的contrapuntal analysis framework确实很适合用来解读这种cross-cultural dialogue🙏。很期待在symposium上交流 - 我准备了一些关于translingual practice在民国时期教育中作用的findings。对了，会场附近有家不错的tea house，他们的Earl Grey配scone很值得推荐👍。
[A]: How perfectly serendipitous! Earl Grey happens to be my favorite - its bergamot notes always put me in mind of the citrus groves in Eliot's 'The Waste Land.' Shall we say 3 o'clock on the second day, after the panel on transcultural modernism? I'll bring my well-worn copy of Pound's translations to compare with your materials on Xu Zhimo. This promises to be a most stimulating exchange of ideas.
[B]: Perfect timing！那个panel正好在我presentation之后。我会带上我的research notes，特别是关于bilingual education在creative writing中作用的data📚。对了，如果你感兴趣，我还可以分享一些recent findings关于how code-switching affects cognitive flexibility in literary translation。Looking forward to our intellectual tea session！
[A]: What a splendid proposal! Your research on code-switching dovetails beautifully with my current interest in heteroglossia in modernist poetry. I'll bring along my annotated copy of 'The Cantos' - Pound's experimental use of multiple languages might provide an interesting counterpoint to your findings. Until then, I shall leave you to your preparations. May our conversation be as rich and layered as a fine oolong tea.
[B]: Indeed！Pound的multilingual approach确实是个fascinating parallel case🙏。期待我们的cross-disciplinary dialogue能碰撞出更多insights。Until then, happy reading！记得试试那家tea house的scone，他们的clotted cream是homemade的🎵。
[A]: You've quite won me over with this description of homemade clotted cream! It brings to mind Woolf's description of afternoon tea at Monk's House - simple pleasures that often spark the most profound conversations. I shall count the days until our meeting, and in the meantime, immerse myself in your fascinating research area. Happy reading to you as well, and may your scones always be warm!
[B]: What a poetic way to conclude our conversation！这让我想起Woolf说的关于tea and conversation的wisdom✍️。See you at the symposium - 记得带把umbrella，那几天weather forecast说有scattered showers☔️。Till then, happy researching！
[A]: How thoughtful of you to mention the weather - it reminds me of that beautiful line from "Mrs. Dalloway" about London showers polishing the city like precious stones. I shall indeed pack my trusty umbrella, the one with the William Morris print that always makes me feel rather literary. Until we meet amidst the rain and words at the symposium - may your research flourish like spring blossoms after the rain.
[B]: Your literary references always brighten the conversation like sunshine after rain☀️。带着William Morris umbrella的你一定会成为symposium上一道独特的风景线！让我们把这场anticipated meeting变成现实版的Bloomsbury Group gathering吧。Safe travels，到时见🙏！
[A]: What a charming vision you paint - our symposium as a modern Bloomsbury gathering! Though I fear we may lack Virginia Woolf's sharp wit, we shall certainly compensate with academic enthusiasm. My Morris umbrella and I shall be there without fail, ready to weather both the showers and the storm of ideas. Until then, may your journey be as smooth as a well-scanning line of iambic pentameter.
[B]: Haha，你总是能用最literary的方式表达日常小事🎵。不过说到iambic pentameter，我最近正好在研究poetry recitation对bilingual children's phonological awareness的影响 - 看来我们的conversation circle又回到了education psychology的core interest📚。Till we meet，愿你的presentation准备像sonnet一样perfectly structured！
[A]: How wonderfully our dialogue has come full circle, like the ouroboros of interdisciplinary scholarship! Your research on phonological awareness through poetry reminds me of the ancient Chinese 吟诵 tradition - another fascinating intersection we might explore over those scones. May your own preparations unfold with the grace of a Shakespearean sonnet's volta. Until we meet amidst the rain and rhyme of academic exchange!
[B]: Indeed！吟诵传统正是我的next research project✍️。看来我们的tea session agenda已经排得满满当当了 - 从modernist poetry到classical Chinese pedagogy，再到clotted cream的aesthetics🙏。Safe travels，期待一场如十四行诗般structured yet spontaneous的学术对话！
