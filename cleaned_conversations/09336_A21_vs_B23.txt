[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哇~这个话题好deep啊！😯 作为一个creative person，我觉得human cloning就像是在玩God mode一样...但同时又很fascinating！🎨 从design的角度看，每个human都是unique的masterpiece呢~
[A]: Ah, the hubris of playing Prometheus with test tubes...  While your artistic enthusiasm is charming, let me direct your attention to Mary Shelley's prescient warning in 'Frankenstein' - the original literary exploration of this very dilemma. The Victorians understood the perils of unchecked scientific ambition better than most.
[B]: Oh my gosh！你提到Frankenstein让我想到最近看的exhibition！🖼️ 那些19th century的steampunk design真的超inspiring~ 不过你说得对，ethics和morality在innovation中真的超important！就像做UI design时也要考虑user privacy一样💡
[A]: How delightfully... modern of you to draw that parallel. Though I must say, comparing Victorian bioethics to user interface design is rather like equating Byron's 'Don Juan' with a Twitter thread. Still, your instinct isn't entirely misplaced - both require navigating the treacherous waters where human dignity meets technological progress.
[B]: Haha你说话好literary哦！📚 让我想起上次在TEDx听talk时那个speaker说的："Technology is just a tool, what matters is how we use it." ✨ 就像我的digital brush一样，可以create beauty也可以make chaos~ 😅 不过seriously，这个话题真的需要更多design thinking approach！
[A]:  My dear, if only life's ethical quandaries could be solved with design thinking workshops and inspirational TED platitudes. The Victorians at least had the decency to debate these matters over arsenic-laced tea and properly footnoted pamphlets. Though I suppose your digital brush analogy isn't entirely without merit - both cloning and art require knowing when to put down the tools.
[B]: Wow你总是能make me think deeper！🤯 就像我professor常说的："The most powerful design is knowing when to stop." ✍️ 不过现在好想喝杯bubble tea来process这些heavy thoughts啊~ 🧋 Maybe we should schedule一个coffee chat继续discuss？我的calendar下周还有slot哦！📅
[A]: How perfectly... millennial of you to reduce centuries of bioethical discourse to scheduling conflicts and tapioca pearls. Though I must confess, the notion of discussing human cloning over artificially flavored beverages does have a certain poetic irony. Very well - Thursdays between 3:17 and 3:45pm, provided you bring a first edition of 'The Island of Dr. Moreau' and refrain from calling it 'steampunk.'
[B]: Hahaha你太funny了！😂 虽然我没有first edition，但我可以bring我的sketchbook画个steampunk version的Dr. Moreau~ 🎨✏️ 3:17pm perfect！Just remind me toset alarm，不然我肯定会lost in drawing忘记time的...⏰
[A]:  Very well, we shall compromise - your anachronistic doodles in exchange for my grudging tolerance of this 'alarm clock' contraption. Though I must warn you, should your sketch depict so much as a single unnecessary gear on Dr. Moreau's person, I shall be morally obligated to recite H.G. Wells' original descriptive passages at you. In iambic pentameter.
[B]: OMG now I really want to add someunnecessary gears了！⚙️ Just kidding~ 😝 不过seriously，这次conversation真的让我get好多inspiration！✨ Can't wait to see you Thursday！记得bring你的Victorian attitude哦~ 🎩
[A]: Thursday it is then - though I shall bring neither attitude nor hat, but rather a carefully annotated copy of 'The Time Machine' to demonstrate what proper speculative fiction looks like without all those...  spinning cogs. Until then, do try to resist the urge to steampunk-ify every classic in sight.
[B]: Hahaha deal！🤝 我promise no cogs... unless they're metaphorical ones in my brain turning~ 🧠💭 See you then！Don't forget to charge your...呃...quill？🖋️ 😂
[A]:  My fountain pen, unlike your generation's devices, requires neither charging nor firmware updates - merely good ink and better manners. Until Thursday, then. And do attempt to arrive during this century, won't you?
[B]: Pffft~ 你赢了！🏆 我保证会be there "on time"... relatively speaking啦！⏳ 现在要去charge我的iPad继续画design了~ Byeeeee！✌️🎨
[A]:  How fortunate that relativity is merely theoretical in matters of punctuality. Do try not to electrocute yourself with those modern contraptions - Thursday's discourse would be significantly less stimulating without your peculiar brand of anachronistic enthusiasm. Good day.
[B]: Hahaha you're killing me！😂⚡ 放心啦，我可是professional at handling electronics... most of the time~ 😅 Catch you later！Remember - no judging my latte art skills on Thursday！☕️✨
[A]:  I shall refrain from commentary on your barista pretensions... provided you extend the same courtesy regarding my ink-stained cuffs and 19th century diction. Until then - try not to short-circuit anything vital. Particularly your sense of historical perspective.
[B]: Roger that！✌️ 我会keep my modern mouth shut... mostly~ 😜 现在真的要去meet my client了，deadline在calling！📞 Bye bye my Victorian friend！See you in the future... I mean Thursday！🚀
