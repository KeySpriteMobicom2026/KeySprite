[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, I must confess my evenings are usually occupied with comparing the 1987 CCTV adaptation of  with the original text. Though I did recently watch a fascinating documentary on the influence of Dickensian serialization on modern television narratives.
[A]: How fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the parallels between Victorian serial novels and contemporary TV dramas. The cliffhanger technique in particular seems to have endured remarkably well.
[A]: Precisely! The way Dickens employed  endings in  mirrors exactly what modern showrunners do between episodes. Though I must say, the Chinese  (章回) novel structure from the Ming Dynasty perfected this technique centuries earlier - have you read ?
[A]: Ah, Jin Ping Mei - now there's a text that would make even the most scandalous Victorian serial blush! Though I find its episodic structure rather more sophisticated than the typical 'who shot JR' style of modern television. Tell me, have you noticed how contemporary prestige dramas borrow from classical Chinese narrative techniques while pretending they invented them?
[A]: How delightfully observant of you! The so-called 'nonlinear storytelling' in shows like  is essentially a diluted version of the  (回响) technique from Tang dynasty tales. Though I do wish modern screenwriters would acknowledge their debts - my graduate students keep presenting these 'innovations' as if Li Yu never wrote  with its nested narratives.
[A]:  And let's not forget the current obsession with 'unreliable narrators' - as if Borges invented the concept rather than inheriting it from . Though I suppose we should be grateful they're not still claiming Shakespeare invented the five-act structure. Have you read the Yuan dynasty zaju plays? Their dramatic pacing puts most Netflix originals to shame.
[A]: Ah! The zaju's  (楔子) prologues alone contain more structural sophistication than an entire season of . Though I must defend my undergraduates - last semester one brilliant thesis compared the narrative function of ghosts in  to . There may yet be hope for this generation.
[A]: How refreshing to hear of such scholarship! Though I do worry this cultural amnesia extends beyond television - why, just last week I overheard someone praising a 'groundbreaking' new novel for using footnotes, as if Nabokov hadn't done it in , and Qian Zhongshu in  before him. The literary world's memory seems shorter than a TikTok attention span these days.
[A]:  Don't get me started on that  comparison - Qian's footnotes contained more philosophical depth in a single asterisk than most contemporary novels manage in 300 pages. Though I suppose we should be grateful they're reading at all, even if it's through the lens of whatever the algorithm deems 'trending' this week.
[A]: Quite. Though I maintain that any student who can appreciate the layered irony in Qian's chicken-footnote metaphor deserves at least a first-class degree. Perhaps we should assign  alongside  next term - let them trace the footnote's evolution from scholarly apparatus to postmodern plaything. With extra credit for anyone who notices the  commentary tradition lurking in the margins.
[A]: Now there's a syllabus that would make my Ming dynasty edition of  with its interlinear commentaries weep with joy. Though I'd insist they read the original woodblock prints - these students think 'marginalia' means Twitter threads. ... Perhaps we could start a reading group: 'From  (注) to David Foster Wallace'?
[A]: An inspired proposal! Though I'd wager half the students would drop out upon realizing our 'reading group' involves actual reading. Still, the ones who remain might just rediscover that magical moment when marginal annotations transform from academic obligation to - dare I say it - genuine pleasure. Like that sublime passage in  where the commentator becomes a character in his own right...
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon the very essence of  commentary - where the margins breathe with as much life as the main text! Though I fear we've strayed rather far from television... not that I mind. These digressions are far more stimulating than discussing whatever Marvel is serializing this month. Shall we continue over tea? I've just acquired a rather exceptional pu'er that tastes like ink and nostalgia.
[A]: How perfectly fitting - a tea that embodies the very essence of literary scholarship! Though I must warn you, the last time I drank pu'er while analyzing texts, I ended up translating Emily Dickinson into classical Chinese couplets until dawn. A hazard of the profession, I suppose. Lead the way to your library, dear colleague - I suspect this conversation has several more chapters yet to unfold.
[A]: Indeed - and unlike modern streaming services, our discourse won't be canceled after one season! Though I should warn you, my library currently resembles a battlefield between Volume 3 of the  and a particularly aggressive stack of student papers. Do mind your step around the 19th century British novels - they have a tendency to form precarious alliances with Tang poetry collections.
[A]: How wonderfully chaotic - a true bibliographic ! Though I must say, that precarious alliance sounds rather like my own desk, where a first edition  has been conducting a rather torrid affair with a Song dynasty  anthology. At least your student papers make for better company than my department's latest memo about 'learning outcome assessments' - now there's a text that could use some marginal commentary!
[A]: Ah, administrative documents - the only texts where even the most creative close reading can't uncover hidden depths! Though I did once annotate a curriculum review form with references to ... the Dean still hasn't forgiven me for pointing out that our assessment rubrics lack the satirical bite of Wu Jingzi. Shall we take our tea among the ruins of proper scholarship before the next memo arrives?
[A]:  To proper scholarship then - may it forever remain gloriously unassessable! Though I suspect our pu'er will have turned to ink by the time we finish debating whether assessment rubrics constitute a new form of . After you, my dear colleague - and do mind that teetering stack of  commentaries, they've been particularly restless since the last full moon.
[A]: How right you are - those commentaries do get quarrelsome during lunar phases!  Here's to unquantifiable erudition and the ghosts of marginalia past. Though I should mention the pu'er is now properly aged - much like our academic grievances. Shall we begin with comparing Victorian bureaucracy to Qing dynasty civil service exams, or save that particular delight for the second infusion?
