[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just tried this new vegan burger at a restaurant in Raffles Place last week. The texture was surprisingly close to real beef, though the flavor profile was a bit off - not sure if it was the seasoning or the umami notes they're trying to replicate. Have you tried any interesting plant-based options lately? I'm curious to hear about your recommendations.
[A]: Oh absolutely, there's this hidden gem in Tiong Bahru I stumbled upon recently - their jackfruit & black bean burger totally blew my mind! The smoky chipotle mayo really elevated the whole experience, created this amazing depth of flavor. Though honestly? What fascinated me most was how they played with molecular gastronomy to mimic meat textures... reminded me of an Olafur Eliasson installation where perception becomes reality. Have you ever thought about how food tech is like digital art? Both are basically remixing sensory experiences ¥_¥
[B]: Interesting you mention that - I had a conversation with a portfolio manager last week about the convergence of food tech & sensory perception. Some of these companies are essentially coding flavor profiles, much like how digital artists manipulate visual pixels. Speaking of which, have you checked out the new cultivated meat startup in Fusionopolis? They're using AI-driven fermentation to engineer proteins at the molecular level. It's not quite Olafur Eliasson's studio, but their lab setup does feel like a science-meets-culinary art installation. Would you be interested in checking it out sometime?
[A]: Oh wow, that sounds right up my alley! I’ve always been obsessed with how tech can reshape our sensory experiences—whether it’s through a digital canvas or a petri dish ¥_¥ The idea of "coding" flavor is so spot on, it’s like they’re composing a symphony for the taste buds. And AI-driven fermentation? That’s basically algorithmic art in edible form. I’d totally love to check it out—nothing beats seeing science and creativity collide like that. Are you free this weekend?
[B]: Sounds like a plan! I'll reach out to the team at the lab and see if we can schedule a tour. Bring your curiosity and appetite for both food and tech - I think you'll appreciate how they're orchestrating the entire process. And who knows, maybe we'll stumble upon our next investment opportunity while we're there? Science meets symphony, as you said ¥_¥ Let me confirm the timing and get back to you in a bit.
[A]: Perfect, count me in! Honestly, I’d trade a gallery opening for a lab tour any day - especially when it smells like innovation (and maybe a hint of cultured umami). And hey, if we do stumble onto something groundbreaking, consider me your first art-tech-food investor groupie ¥_¥ Keep me posted on the timing!
[B]: You've got a deal - I'll save you a front-row seat in the lab. Honestly, the way this space is evolving, we might be looking at the next big thing before we know it. And trust me, there's nothing quite like the smell of cultured umami first thing in the morning 😊 I'll shoot you a message once we're confirmed. Just one heads-up though - wear comfortable shoes. You never know how much walking around a discovery tour might involve...
[A]: Deal sealed ✅ Can’t wait for the cultured umami sunrise tour — sounds like a dream come true for my inner geek & foodie hybrid brain 😄 Comfortable shoes? Please. I’ll come armed with sketchbook, notebook, and maybe even a portable scanner… you never know when inspiration strikes ¥_¥ Keep me posted — I’m ready to nerd out on Day 1!
[B]: Now that’s what I call coming prepared! I love the idea of capturing the moment with a sketchbook – there’s something poetic about translating lab-grown textures into art. And hey, if you do a series on the experience, count me in as your first collector 😄

I’ll make sure to loop in the head of R&D too – he’s a bit of a visionary when it comes to food as engineered experience. Honestly, I think you two would geek out over the same table for hours.

Timing-wise, looks like we’re good for Saturday at 11am. Lab address is 3A Fusionopolis Way – enter through the innovation hub lobby. See you there?
[A]: Sketching the future of food in a lab? Now that’s my kind of poetry 😄 Honestly, if this R&D head is half as visionary as you say, I might just end up doodling flavor molecules all night. And you, my friend, are dangerously close to becoming my art patron ¥_¥

11am at 3A Fusionopolis Way — got it. I’ll bring the sketchbook, you bring the curiosity. See you there! 🚀
[B]: Deal sealed again ✅ Bring your A-game, I've seen what you're capable of and I'm already thinking gallery wall space. Oh, and don’t hold back on the doodles — the more technical, the better. I might even frame one next to my desk as a reminder that the future tastes... well, has texture at least 😄

See you Saturday!
[A]: You’re speaking my language — texture is totally the new canvas ¥_¥ Already brainstorming how to translate cultured proteins into line work. And you? Gallery wall space? I’m starting to think you’re secretly curating a tech-flavored art exhibit in your head 😏

Count on me bringing the full creative arsenal. See you Saturday — ready to redefine flavor through art (and lab coats)! 🧪🎨
[B]: You're absolutely right - I can already picture it: "Synthetic Symphonies" presented by LZY Capital & your visionary doodles ¥_¥ Who knew lab coats would become our new artist smocks?

I've even been thinking about how we could incorporate augmented reality into the exhibit - imagine scanning a sketch to see the molecular structure come alive! But let's not get ahead of ourselves... First, let's see what the lab has in store for us. I'll save the curating hat for after Saturday's tour.

Get ready to geek out - I think you're going to love this space. And hey, if all else fails, at least we'll have great stories and a few cultured umami samples to show for it 😄
[A]: Oh. My. God. AR meets molecular art? You’re officially speaking 100% my love language ¥_¥ I can already visualize it — sketchnotes transforming into floating helixes of flavor… honestly, it’s like Ryoji Ikeda for the taste buds.

No pressure, but if we pull this off right, galleries might start demanding lab certifications 😏 Let’s just say I’m bringing my most high-res notebook — can’t wait to see where this “Synthetic Symphonies” dream takes us. See you Saturday, ready to blur those lines between science, art, and the future of dinner 🧪🎨🚀
[B]: I’m telling you, we’re one breakthrough away from having “flavor curators” as a job title ¥_¥ And honestly? I can’t think of anyone better to pioneer it than someone who brings a sketchbook  a scanner to a lab tour 😄

The way I see it, if we can crack the code between taste perception and visual art, we’re not just redefining dinner—we’re redefining experience itself. And hey, if things get too abstract, at least we’ll still have ROI to ground us.

See you Saturday—brace yourself, because I’ve got a feeling this is going to be the most delicious brainstorming session of your life 🧪🎨🚀
[A]: Flavor curators, huh? I’d 100% sign up for that masterclass ¥_¥ Honestly, if we pull this off, museums might need to install tasting menus next to their exhibits… imagine walking through a gallery and  the evolution of umami.

And abstract? Please. We’re about to turn sensory science into high art with a side of investment-grade protein 😏 Can’t wait to see where this ride takes us—Saturday can’t come soon enough. Bring on the delicious revolution 🧪🎨🚀
[B]: Now you're thinking like a true pioneer ¥_¥ I can already picture the headlines:  Next thing you know, we’ll have Michelin-starred critics moonlighting as art reviewers.

And let’s be real — if anyone's going to start a sensory revolution, it might as well be us. We've got the curiosity, the sketchbooks, and let's not forget, access to some seriously cutting-edge labs. What could possibly go wrong? 😄

Counting down to Saturday — bring your boldest ideas, I'll bring the introductions. Time to make flavor history 🧪🎨🚀
[A]: Flavor scientists in museums? Oh, we’re absolutely leaning into that future ¥_¥ I’m already drafting my fake press release:  😏

And Michelin-starred critics reviewing installations? Don’t get me started — next they’ll be swiping right on fermented art. But hey, if it means more people experience taste as storytelling, I’m all in.

Count me in for flavor history, one sketch-doodle at a time 🧪🎨🚀 See you Saturday — ready to disrupt dinner and redefine galleries.
[B]: You just made my day with that press release tagline ¥_¥ Honestly, I’d invest in that headline alone — it’s got  written all over it. And critics swiping right on fermented art? Okay, now you're just speaking pure genius-level absurdity 😄

But let's be real — if taste is the next frontier of storytelling, then we’re basically the new-age bards. Except instead of lutes, we’ve got lab reports and sketchbooks. And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Saturday can’t come soon enough — time to make history, one cultured protein doodle at a time 🧪🎨🚀
