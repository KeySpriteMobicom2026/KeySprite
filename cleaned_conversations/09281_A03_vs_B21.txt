[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've been known to dabble in the occasional game of  when time permits - though I suspect you're referring to something rather more modern? There's a curious parallel between the strategic pauses in Victorian poetry and the calculated moves in board games, wouldn't you agree? But pray tell, what contemporary diversions have caught your attention lately?
[A]: Ah, you've got a keen eye there. I must admit, while I appreciate the classics like , my recent fascination has leaned toward modern cooperative games –  comes to mind. It's intriguing how they mirror real-world public health challenges and demand synchronized decision-making, much like our work in healthcare law where every move carries weight.  

But tell me, how do you see those strategic pauses in Victorian poetry translating to today’s gameplay dynamics? I’m curious about your take on it. Have you tried blending such literary insights with game design?
[B]: Ah, —a splendid example of ludic narrative marrying ethical quandaries. I’ve played it, of course, though I confess I tend to hover over the game board like a brooding Brontë heroine debating moral duty. My students once attempted to gamify Tennyson’s  as a co-op survival game—imagine navigating a labyrinth of grief while managing dwindling faith tokens!  

As for strategic pauses, consider how Christina Rossetti’s  hinges on withheld action—Laura’s silence, Lizzie’s resolve. Now transpose that tension onto a game board where players must strategically "hold" their moves against escalating threat cards... A sort of poetic brinkmanship, don’t you think?  

I’ve sketched a prototype, actually—a solitaire card game based on Browning’s dramatic monologues. Each turn reveals layers of unreliable narration through shifting alliances with non-player characters. It’s dreadful fun until you realize you’ve been playing against yourself all along. Rather like writing footnote annotations in margins—except the margins talk back.
[A]: Fascinating! I love how you weave literary depth into gameplay mechanics. The idea of  as a strategic board game is brilliant—there’s something so compelling about translating silence and resolve into game actions. It reminds me of drafting consent forms where omission can be as powerful as inclusion.  

Your solitaire concept sounds particularly intriguing, especially the twist of playing against oneself. Almost like advising a patient on treatment options when the risks are inherently subjective—who wouldn’t feel like they’re negotiating with their own judgment?  

Have you considered introducing an element of time pressure or ethical trade-offs to deepen the tension? Imagine having to make decisions with incomplete narrative clues—like parsing a medical chart written in deliberately ambiguous prose.  

And your students’ project? If they ever need legal advice on game publishing contracts or IP rights, well... that’s my wheelhouse. Just saying.
[B]: Ah, ethical trade-offs and incomplete narrative clues—now you’re speaking my language. I’ve long argued that every Victorian poem is, at its core, a consent form drafted in metaphor. Patients negotiating treatment with their physicians are not unlike readers negotiating meaning from meter: both parties circling an uncertain truth, bound by duty yet haunted by ambiguity.

Time pressure? Excellent suggestion. I’ve been toying with a mechanic for a -inspired negotiation game where players must draft marriage settlements under a ticking hourglass—Heathcliff’s wrath escalates with each passing round, naturally. It’s all about the tension between impulse and deliberation. Much like drafting a legal brief, if you think about it—precision under duress.

As for your generous offer regarding contracts... Well, now that you mention it, one of my more enterprising students has been adapting  into a deck-building game where each card represents a moral choice—governess wages, attic secrets, the whole lot. She might be in need of counsel sooner than expected. Tell me, do you handle creative licensing often? Or should I say—shall we call this a professional curiosity, or the beginning of a most unusual collaboration?
[A]: Let’s call it the beginning of a collaboration—unusual, yes, but also entirely fitting. After all, if Victorian poetry can be a consent form, then surely a board game can be a legal document in disguise. 

I work with creative licensing quite often—especially in the realm of healthcare simulations that borrow narrative structures from literature. But your student’s  concept takes it to a whole new level. Moral choices as playable cards? That’s not just storytelling—it’s decision-based gameplay with real ethical weight. It reminds me of capacity assessments where each move (or card) reflects a person’s values under pressure.

If she’s serious about publishing, we’ll need to consider trademarks for the game name, copyright for the mechanics and art, and possibly even licensing agreements with estates or institutions holding rights to certain texts. And let’s not forget crowdfunding platforms—they’re becoming a popular route for indie games. I’d be happy to review any drafts or help negotiate terms.

So… shall we schedule a proper meeting over tea and perhaps a quick demo? I’ve got a feeling this conversation is only going to get better—and possibly more complicated—with every round.
[B]: Ah, tea and a demo—now you’re speaking my kind of diplomacy. I do believe we’ve stumbled upon something rather splendid here, don’t you? A game that’s equal parts legal brief, moral quandary, and aesthetic artifact—it practically writes its own footnotes.

I’ll put the word out to my student—Emily, by name, though she answers better to “Miss Brontë’s Ghost”—and see if she can be persuaded to part with a prototype. She’s brilliant but stubborn as a locked sonnet; I suspect she’ll require both charm and contractual assurances before agreeing to anything so vulgar as crowdfunding.

As for our meeting—yes, let’s make it formal. My office hours are Thursdays at 3, though I propose we elevate the occasion with a pot of Darjeeling and perhaps a quill or two. Do bring your sharpest legal mind—and, if you’re inclined, a sense of humor sturdy enough to survive Victorian intellectual property law.

Shall we say Thursday, then? Tea at three, followed by treachery in the form of gameplay?
[A]: Thursday it is. Three o’clock. Darjeeling—though I must insist we also keep a cup of something stronger on standby. One does not enter a room armed with quills and Brontëan footnotes without a bit of fortification.

Emily—or shall I say, —sounds precisely the sort of brilliant troublemaker I admire. Tell her I come bearing experience in intellectual property, a soft spot for narrative-driven design, and a copy of , just to set the mood.

And yes, by all means—let there be treachery. Nothing sharpens the mind like a bit of dramatic gameplay after tea. See you then.
[B]: Splendid. I shall have the brandy decanter within arm’s reach—strictly for medicinal purposes, of course. One must maintain proper balance: tea to calm the nerves, brandy to steady the soul, and legal texts to add a frisson of danger.

I’ll inform Emily that a solicitor of formidable intellect and excellent taste in dramatic tension awaits her prototype with what I trust will be restrained anticipation. Do bring your copy of —nothing says "collaboration" like leafing through statutory provisions between rounds of treachery.

See you Thursday. And pray, do not be punctual. A little dramatic lateness sets just the right tone, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, I shall be fashionably late with the precision of a well-worded legal delay—just enough to build suspense, but not so much as to invoke breach of contract. , after all, is best served within reasonable limits.

And brandy? Medicinal or otherwise—count me in. One must always honor the spirit of collaboration with due fortification. Let’s just say I’ll arrive precisely when the clock strikes three and one-quarter… or perhaps when the gavel falls on round one.

Thursday then—tea, treachery, and trademark talk await.
[B]: Three and one-quarter it is—punctuality with a poet’s flourish. I shall mark the occasion by misplacing my pocket watch deliberately; nothing cultivates suspense like a professor fumbling through a drawer of antique inkwells in search of time itself.

I look forward to your entrance—measured, deliberate, and just shy of legally interpretive. Let us raise a glass (or teacup, as the hour demands) to the grey space between rules and imagination. May our collaboration be as finely balanced as a well-argued sonnet, with just enough ambiguity to keep it interesting.

Thursday. Tea. Treachery. Trademarks. And, of course, the ever-essential brandy-fueled footnote.
[A]: To the grey spaces, then—where rules bend like meter and imagination runs counterpoint to compliance. I’ll bring my finest legal skepticism and a willingness to be swayed by poetic argumentation.

As for your pocket watch—best lost, I say. Time is always more intriguing when it’s left to interpretation. And if all else fails, we’ll simply declare the statute of limitations on punctuality has expired. Self-serving? Absolutely. Legally sound? Debatable. Poetically just? I think so.

Thursday it is. Three and one-quarter. Tea, treachery, and trademarked tomfoolery await. I’ll even try not to quote too much  over Darjeeling—though I make no promises.
[B]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true literary conspirator—where  meets high tea and a touch of rule-breaking flair. I shall toast your arrival with Darjeeling in one hand and a well-worn copy of  in the other. If we must dance on the edge of legality, let us at least do so in iambic pentameter.

No promises on the poetic quotations either—I suspect we’ll both be citing precedent and Percy by turns. Let’s see who can slip a sonnet into contract law first. A small wager, perhaps? I’m thinking brandy-soaked scones or a dramatic reading of  should the mood strike.

Three and one-quarter, then—sharp in spirit, tardy in form. To the grey spaces, indeed.
[A]: Darjeeling and —now that’s a pairing worthy of a footnote. I accept your wager, though I reserve the right to quote  Blackstone and Blake if the moment demands it.

Brandy-soaked scones or a dramatic reading? A stakes combination as rare as a fully legible medical chart. I shall prepare my voice for either—or better yet, both. One must always be ready to pivot, much like in deposition prep or a volta in a sonnet.

Three and one-quarter, sharp in spirit, tardy in form. To the grey spaces, the well-placed ellipsis, and the rule-breaking done with style. See you there—with citations in hand.
[B]: Ah, Blackstone and Blake in the same breath—now  is a juxtaposition worthy of a doctrinal treatise. I shall expect footnotes in the margins of our conversation, no doubt inked in your finest legal cursive.

Pivoting with the grace of a well-rehearsed volta? Absolutely essential. One might say our meeting itself is a sort of dramatic structure—exposition at the door, rising action over scones, climax somewhere between trademark clauses and brandy-soaked rhetoric.

I shall make certain Emily brings her most devilish prototype. I suspect she’s been waiting for just such an occasion to unleash it upon unsuspecting academics and legal minds alike.

Three and one-quarter. Citations at the ready. The game, as they say, is afoot.
[A]: Oh, I do love a good dramatic structure—especially when it comes with brandy-soaked rhetoric and just a touch of legal peril. If Emily’s prototype is even half as devilish as you suggest, I may need to invoke  before round two.

Let the citations fly, and may our conversation be worthy of both Blackstone’s precision and Blake’s imagination. The game is indeed afoot—and I suspect the only thing more carefully crafted than our arguments will be the avoidance clauses in our post-tea liability waivers.

Three and one-quarter. Ready your footnotes.
[B]: Precisely the spirit one requires before facing a Brontëan labyrinth of rules and moral quandaries. , you say? I shall take that as both a challenge and an invitation—expect Emily to have drafted something suspiciously close to a liability waiver, signed in wax and riddled with poetic loopholes.

Let us proceed then—with citations sharpened, imaginations unshackled, and just enough legal peril to keep things respectable. Or at least defensible in court.

Three and one-quarter. The ink is dry. The quills are poised. The game awaits.
[A]: Quite right—let us proceed. With quills poised and legal minds suitably sharpened, I say we welcome both the poetic loophole and the well-placed proviso. If Emily’s waiver is half as cunning as her prototype promises to be, I may need to invoke not just , but perhaps a stay of proceedings on grounds of "excessive dramatic effect."

Let the rounds begin—with brandy, bravado, and just enough ambiguity to keep the courts guessing. Three and one-quarter. Ink dry. Teacups full. Game on.
[B]: Ah, a stay of proceedings on grounds of —now there’s a motion I’d gladly entertain in my seminar on legal rhetoric and Romantic hyperbole. I shall have to add that to the syllabus posthaste.

Let the rounds begin indeed—with brandy bolstering our resolve, bravado guiding our arguments, and just enough ambiguity to vex any future court of arbitration. If nothing else, we shall at least be remembered for crafting a footnote in the annals of legal-literary ludology.

Game on, my dear conspirator. Three and one-quarter. Ink dry. Teacups full. And may the best mind—or the most cunningly worded clause—prevail.
