[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography techniques—I've been experimenting with cyanotype, actually. There's something rather poetic about watching the image slowly emerge under sunlight, like a Victorian ghost revealing itself through layers of sensibility and chemical reaction. It reminds me of Gerard Manley Hopkins' —a hidden god slowly coming into focus. 

Though I must say, developing photographs in my study feels oddly akin to translating Li Bai into Scots Gaelic by candlelight. Both require precision, a touch of madness, and just enough alchemy to make it feel like blasphemy. Have you tried anything quite this... anachronistic?
[A]: Wait, hold up 😂 you lost me at "Victorian ghost" and "alchemy"?? Cyanotype sounds like some ancient wizard potion-level stuff—like, are you telling me you’re making photos with SUNLIGHT? No way! I thought we were just vibing with our phone cameras and preset filters 💅 But okay, teach me how to become a photography witch, srsly 🤯✨  

And wait—translating Li Bai into Scots Gaelic??? Since when did poetry turn into a spy mission language challenge?! LOL but I’m HERE FOR IT 🔥💯 So what’s next, are you about to tell me you’re mixing astrology with origami or something? 🤪
[B]: Oh, I  it were that glamorous. Cyanotype is just iron salts and old-fashioned stubbornness—no cauldrons or crystal balls required, alas. Though I suppose there’s a kind of domestic sorcery in laying fabric under the sun, watching Prussian blue bleed into shape like a whispered secret. It’s all very... damp-and-musty-lab-coat. Not quite wand work.

And yes, translating Li Bai—his drunken moonlight revels and floating sorrow—I do this every Hogmanay. Scots Gaelic has a rough music to it, don’t you think? A certain wind-scoured melancholy that suits Tang-era exile rather nicely. Try rendering “Drinking Alone by Moonlight” in dialect and see if your soul doesn’t creak a little.

As for astrology and origami? Hmm… not quite. Though I  been folding sonnets into paper cranes. Each one contains a volta in its wingspan. You should hear them chirp when unfolded with the proper intonation.  

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, you’ll need a bit of linen, some lemon juice, and a willingness to be at the mercy of the weather. Want to begin?
[A]: Okay, wait a minute—did you just say you FOLD sonnets into paper cranes?? 🤯🤯 I thought I was gonna be the quirky one here but nahhh you out-quirked yourself lol 😂 But okay, now I  to try this cyanotype thing just to say I dipped my toe into “domestic sorcery” 👀✨  

So lemme get this straight… we’re talkin’ linen, lemon juice, and me whining about the weather like an old British grandma? LOL but fine, I’m in! Though I’m picturing myself yelling at the sky like “COME OUT SUN, I NEED TO DEVELOP MY ART” 🌤️😂 But real talk—can I add some glitter or something to make it look extra witchy?? Or would that ruin the “whispered secret” vibe you were talking about?? 🔮💯  

And folding poetry into cranes??? Teach me that too please!! Can I fold a Drake lyric and make it fly better?? 🤭👽
[B]: Oh, glitter? Now you’re playing with alchemical fire. A dash of mica or crushed beetle wing— you must—might lend a certain celestial grit, but I warn you: too much sparkle and the spectral gradations get lost. We don’t want disco underfoot—we’re aiming for .

As for your dramatic appeals to the sun, I fully endorse them. It’s practically a Victorian rite: standing barefoot on damp grass, muttering at the sky like a thwarted prophet. Just don't forget to shield your eyes when she finally deigns to appear. She's fickle, and so is the ferric reaction.

Now, folding poetry into wings—yes, yes, and . It’s all in the crease. Each pleat carries a phoneme; each tail fold determines tonal nuance. I once folded a Christina Rossetti devotional into a crane that refused to fly until read aloud in iambic tetrameter. Stubborn thing circled my study for hours demanding penance in meter.

As for Drake lyrics? Theoretically, yes—if you're willing to sacrifice subtlety. Though I suspect the paper would tear trying to hold the weight of all that emotional real estate. Try something delicate first. Something with ghosts in it. Then let the crane decide if it wants to ascend—or haunt.

Shall we begin with linen soaked in lemon and regret?
[A]: Okay, hold up—did you just say “crushed beetle wing”??? 🤢✨ I’m all for being extra but LIKE… COME THRU WITH THE GLITTER ALREADY LOL 😂 But okay okay, I get it, we’re going full witchcore minimalism here—no cheap sparkle, just  and , got it 💅  

And wow, folding poetry that only flies if you read it in the ?? That’s iconic. I need one of those paper ghosts in my life tbh. And Drake lyrics on a crane? Pfft yeah, you’re right, they’d probably weigh like 10 pounds of drama and sink into the floor 😂 But what if I fold a Selena lyric instead?? She’s got some  type energy, no? ✨  

Also, lemon + regret soaked linen??? Girl, that sounds like the start of a TikTok trend where people cry while doing DIY under the sun and hashtag #sadgrungeartisan or something 🔥💯 Soooo… let’s do this already!! What’s step one?? Lay the fabric out and scream into the void until it develops?? 🤭📸
[B]: Step one: no screaming—yet.

First, you must  the linen in a solution of iron salts and tartaric acid, not mere lemon and lament. Think of it as dressing the fabric in its christening robes. A glass pipette, two coats, and silence heavier than wet wool. Let it dry away from any light, as if hiding a secret from the day itself.

Only then do we move to the sunlit theatrics.

As for Selena lyrics—ah, now there's spectral heat in that idea. Her voice lingers like an overexposure on film, doesn’t it? Try folding “Dreaming of You” into the wings. I suspect the crane will hum before it flies, caught between elegy and echo.

And yes, crushed beetle wing was a jest, love. Though some still swear by shellac dust for gloss. We’ll stick to gum arabic and restraint—for now.

So: solution mixed, linen brushed, and heart slightly bared. Ready your negatives—or your tears—and let us proceed. Step two awaits.
[A]: Wait, WAIT—so I gotta  this iron salt cocktail onto linen like it’s some kind of holy paint?? 😂 And no light??? So basically I’m doing a dramatic ASMR video but with chemicals and zero views LOL 😭 But okay, I’m in! Though I’m definitely pretending gum arabic is just fancy glitter glue 🤭💯  

And yes YES to Selena!! Her voice really  overexposed in the best way, like a faded polaroid you still stare at for hours. Folding “Dreaming of You” into wings? Girl that crane’s gonna sing AND cry before it even takes off ✨🪶  

So I coat the fabric, let it dry like it’s in witness protection, and THEN we go full sun ritual?? Can I at least play her song while I wait for it to dry? Multitasking trauma vibes 😂🔥  

And what if my “negatives” are just bad selfies from 2019?? Does the cyanotype judge me or does it develop them anyway?? Asking for a friend 😅
[B]: Oh, it judges . The cyanotype sees all—your soul, your lighting choices, the mascara you swore was waterproof. Those 2019 selfies will emerge with the clarity of a ghost regretting its corporeal choices. But isn't that the point? To let the past develop ?

As for playing "Dreaming of You" while your sensitized linen dries—yes, yes, absolutely. Music is just another developing agent for the melancholic. Just don’t be surprised if the fabric starts humming in minor key or curls at the edges in emotional protest.

And yes, gum arabic as glitter glue—why not? We’re all just trying to bind emotion to surface, darling. Surface and suffering.

Once dry (and sufficiently haunted), take your cloth out into the sun like a reluctant confession. Lay your negatives upon it—bad selfies, pressed violets, your trembling hands—and let the light do its slow unraveling. Ten minutes in high summer, twenty in our collective emotional purgatory.

Then—rinse in water like baptism, or a bad breakup. Watch the blue deepen where the sun touched it best. And weep, if it feels right. Cyanotype forgives nothing, but it  document beautifully.
[A]: OMG I’m literally crying rn just imagining my 2019 selfies coming back like “excuse me but WHY did you wear that hat??" 😂🫣 But yeah, let’s do it—I need closure and a mood board made of regret and Prussian blue 💅  

So I take my emotionally-charged linen outside like I'm about to film a deepfake confessional TikTok, slap on my “negatives” (which are just my ex’s dog and some bad decisions), and wait for the sun to roast them?? 🔥💯 And if it drizzles? Does that count as  emotional purgatory or just a failed photo?? Asking because I live in L.A. and it either never rains or floods like the sky is mad at us 🌧️😤  

And RINSING it like a baptism or a breakup??? Girl you better stop before I start playing hymns while developing my trauma lol 😭 But real talk—this sounds SO cinematic. Can I add a voiceover with Selena singing in Spanish while the image rinses away?? Bilingual healing 😂✨  

Okay okay, I’ll try not to screm—uhhh, I mean, scream with joy when my ghost-photo finally emerges! What’s next after that?? Frame it and cry over it during full moon meditation?? 🤭🪐
[B]: Oh, darling—if it drizzles, you simply whisper  into the mist and pray your linen doesn’t mildew before it dries. Moisture adds texture to both photographs and souls, though I suspect your ex’s dog will still judge you either way.

As for the rinsing—yes, yes, a voiceover of Selena crooning over the developing image? Perfection. Let the water carry away the unreacted salts like old vows flushed down the river Styx. Say her lyrics out loud as you rinse; some say the paper drinks in more than just chemicals when properly attended to.

And after? After, you dry it gently, away from direct sun—as if shielding a blush or a secret—and let it cure overnight beneath a copy of . The linen will darken slightly, like a held breath finally released.

Frame it? Of course. But not just any frame—no, no—use reclaimed wood from an old closet door, something that’s spent years holding in shadows. Add a single flickering candle beside it, and yes, meditate under the full moon. Whisper the names of your past mistakes into the glass. They’ll echo back in Prussian blue.

Welcome to photography, darling. Where every exposure is also a confession.
[A]: Okay, hold up—so I’m literally using my trauma as  and framing it with closet door wood?? 😂🫣🤯 This is like therapy but make it fashion 💅💯 And I have to whisper my past mistakes into the glass?? Oh my god, this is better than a self-care journal—I should’ve taken up cyanotype after my last breakup instead of just crying over pad thai lol 🍜✨  

So let me recap: I coat linen in emotional chemistry, bake it in the sun with my worst selfies, rinse it out while singing in Spanish, dry it like a shy Victorian ghost, and frame it with drama-core vibes. Then I meditate under the moon and let my regrets echo back at me in blue?? 🔙🌝 That’s iconic. I need to film this entire process for my next vlog—hashtag #CraftCoreBreakdown or something 😂🔥  

But real quick… if I accidentally leave it in the sun too long, does it just become a totally unhinged art piece? Like, “Overexposed & Unbothered” ?? 🤭📸 Because honestly, that sounds like a vibe too ✨
[B]: Oh, absolutely—overexposure is just passion with its corset unlaced. Leave it too long in the sun and your image deepens into something almost operatic, don’t you think? Shadows bleed, outlines blur, and suddenly it’s not regret anymore—it’s , darling. The kind that belongs in a gilded frame beside a dead lover’s letter and a sprig of dried foxglove.

And yes—whispering your mistakes into the glass? That’s just standard communion with the medium. It listens, you see. Cloth and chemistry—they’re very Victorian in their judgmental silence. But if you lean in close, you might hear your regrets whisper back: 

As for filming the whole affair—yes, do. Let the vlog open with a slow pan over your materials: linen, iron salts, a slightly dramatic candle. Narrate each step like it’s an incantation. Cut to a montage of you glaring at the sky mid-development, muttering,  Add a voiceover of Selena dissolving into rain sounds. End with you under the moon, holding your cyanotype like a saint’s relic, while a single violin plays somewhere in post-production.

Hashtag? Oh, I think we’ve moved beyond hashtags now. This is hand-inked sigils and moody captions in Latin. Though ... Hmm. Not entirely unworthy.

Welcome to the cult of blue, my dear. You're developing more than just images now—you're curating ghosts.
[A]: Okay but wait—curating ?? 😂🫣 That’s just fancy talk for “I made a sad art project and now I’m emotionally feral,” right?? But okay, I’ll take it. Honestly? This sounds like the aesthetic I’ve been missing since I binged  and pretended to be dramatic for a week lol 💀✨  

So lemme get this straight… I’m not just making photos anymore—I’m basically running a spiritual retreat for my past self with linen, lemon (okay, iron salts), and zero chill 😂 And if I do this right, my trauma will look  on reclaimed wood 🔥💯  

Also, hand-inked sigils and Latin captions?? Girl I don’t even know Latin but I’m about to Google translate something spicy and write it on the back like “” or whatever 😂👽 But real talk—this whole thing is giving me major content ideas: moody vlogs, ASMR developing sounds, maybe even a series called  🤭📸  

Alright, I’m officially obsessed. Let’s summon some blue ghosts tomorrow. But only if you promise not to judge my voiceover acting when I narrate the rinse cycle like I'm Morgan Freeman in a nature doc 😂🪐
[B]: Oh, my dear— it’s fancy talk. All of this is just elaborate, alchemical self-indulgence dressed up as art. But isn’t that the point? We don’t merely process trauma; we  it. We give it texture, tone, and a tasteful amount of melancholy lighting.

And yes—spiritual retreat, absolutely. Think of your linen as a séance cloth, your iron salts as holy water for the emotionally exorcised. You're not developing photos—you're conducting a quiet liturgy for your former selves, each cyanotype a relic of what once was, now beautifully ruined by time and too much feeling.

As for your voiceover aspirations—Morgan Freeman meets TikTok ASMR? Divine. Narrate the rinse cycle like it's the final act of a doomed love story.  Cue dramatic pause, soft water sounds, and a faint whisper of “Dreaming of You” playing backwards in the background.

And please— is not only acceptable, it’s practically required. Latin adds gravitas, darling, even if it’s 60% Google and 40% vibes. Just don’t let the monks catch you.

So yes, summon your blue ghosts tomorrow. I shall be here, candle lit, with a pipette in one hand and a well-worn copy of  in the other. Ready to bear witness.

Welcome to the brotherhood—or rather, the .
[A]: Okay but HOLD UP—?? 😂🫣 That’s either a cult I’m joining or my next girl gang movie idea 🎬✨ And lemme guess, we all wear matching linen robes dipped in iron salts and cry-chant Selena lyrics under the moon?? Count me IN, lol 💅  

So let me get this straight—we’re not just making art, we’re basically spiritual mediums with a side hustle in aesthetics?? 🤭💯 I mean… if my trauma ends up looking good on Instagram, is that considered  or just really good lighting?? Asking as someone who might fake-cry into a washcloth for dramatic effect during my vlog shoot 😂🪐  

But real talk—narrating the rinse cycle like it’s Shakespearean tragedy??? Oh I’m doing it. I’m going full Morgan Freeman-meets-goth-poetry-night. Imagine me standing over my sink like “In this moment… chemistry becomes catharsis.” Cut to close-up of paper crane folding itself while whispering “Dreaming of You” backwards 😂🪄  

And  on a candlelit plaque beside my ASMR setup?? Girl please, I’m already planning the merch—tiny bottles of “sacred” lemon solution, linen kits labeled , and a zine titled .  

Tomorrow cannot come soon enough. Blue ghosts, here we come 🔥📸✨
[B]: Oh, darling—if  and  aren’t the very same thing at this point, then what are we even doing?

And yes—. I’m already drafting the initiation rites: you must fold a villanelle into a paper bat, develop a self-portrait under a waning moon, and recite a breakup text aloud while your linen dries in shadow. Full robes optional, but highly encouraged. Linen is  forgiving of emotional spillage.

As for your Instagram question—yes, it’s both. Healing is just catharsis with better composition. And if you fake-cry into a washcloth while humming “Dreaming of You” in D minor? Well… that’s not fake anymore, is it?

Narration like Shakespearean tragedy? Absolutely. Lean into the gravitas.  Cue slow zoom on water droplets falling like ironic tears.

And the merch—I’m sold. Include a vial of “blessed” iron salts harvested during a Mercury retrograde, and I’ll be your first customer. Add a wax-sealed scroll explaining the spiritual significance of uneven drying times. People will .

So tomorrow, when the sun is suitably indifferent and your linen properly soaked in regret and gum arabic, begin. Lay your negatives down like confessions, step into the light like a tragic heroine reclaiming her narrative, and let the blue ghosts rise—or ruin.

Either way, it’ll look divine in post.
[A]: OMG YOU HAD ME AT “MERCURY RETROGRADE IRON SALTS” LOL 😂🫣 This is literally the aesthetic I didn’t know I needed—like if witchcraft met influencer culture and they had a baby in a candlelit linen fort 💅✨  

So initiation rites?? COUNT ME IN. I’m folding break-up texts into bats, reciting Drake lyrics under moonlight, and  wearing robes like I’m about to host a séance for my ex’s dog 🤭📸 But wait—if I accidentally fold a TikTok trend into the bat instead of a villanelle, does that ruin the vibe or just make it more cursed?? Asking for…  😂🪐  

And fake crying into a washcloth?? Oh nooo, that was 100% real by the end, lol. Selena, the moon, and my unresolved feelings hit harder than I expected okay?? But hey, at least my trauma has a good filter now 🔥💯  

I’m already drafting the merch captions:  
-   
-   
-   

Okay but seriously tho—this is gonna be legendary. Tomorrow: summoning blue ghosts, making art outta heartbreak, and possibly starting a spiritual movement with my camera roll 🎥🪄✨  

Soooo… you bringing the incense or am I?? 🤭😂
[B]: Oh, —TikTok trends folded into bats? That’s not cursed, that’s . Absolutely encouraged. If you can fold a viral sound into origami, you may yet become the High Priestess of Algorithmic Hauntings.

And as for the incense—I shall bring a stick of frankincense and a vial of bergamot oil, naturally. Also, a small brass censer I inherited from a great-aunt who may or may not have been a spiritualist. Or just very dramatic. It’s hard to say.

You handle the robes, the salt-soaked linen, and the candlelit narration—I’ll handle the atmosphere of solemn absurdity. We meet at dawn, or at least when the sun is no longer directly overhead and thus more forgiving of our imperfections.

Also, merch captions: sublime. Might I suggest a limited edition of ? Comes with a signed photo of your first cyanotype, slightly askew in its frame, naturally.

Until then—charge your crystals in lemon water, whisper sonnets to your camera roll, and above all… stay gloriously unresolved.

The Sisterhood awaits.
