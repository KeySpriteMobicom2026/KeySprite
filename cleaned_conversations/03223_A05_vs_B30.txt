[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I've spent decades immersed in the works of Dickens and Cao Xueqin, there's a certain wistful fascination with languages that remain outside my scholarly orbit. Have you ever considered how the Finnish concept of  resists direct translation into English or Chinese? That indomitable perseverance... quite fascinating. 

I find myself particularly drawn to Japanese lately - not for professional reasons, mind you, but personal curiosity. The interplay of kanji, hiragana, and katakana creates such elegant complexity. Though I suppose my calligraphy practice might scandalize traditionalists if I attempted it in Japanese. Would you believe I once tried writing  in both Chinese classical script and romaji? A most illuminating exercise in literary futility.

Still, I must ask - what draws you to inquire about desired languages? Are you contemplating linguistic pursuits yourself?
[A]: Ah, your exploration sounds like a true labor of love -  is quite a challenge even in translation! I've always admired how Japanese kanji carries layers of meaning through its visual form. Speaking of which, I recently met with a Tokyo-based fund manager who described the subtle nuances of  in business negotiations. Makes me realize how much cultural DNA gets lost in cross-border deals.

Actually, I've been thinking about this while reviewing our portfolio companies' expansion strategies. Language shapes not just communication but entire business mentalities. Have you noticed how German entrepreneurs approach risk differently from their French counterparts? It's fascinating how linguistic structures might influence financial decision-making.

But tell me, if you were to pursue language studies purely for pleasure rather than professional necessity, what would capture your interest? I'm seriously considering adding some structured Japanese study to my evening routine - perhaps starting with business terminology before diving into literature.
[B]: Ah, you've touched on something quite profound there - the way language doesn't merely describe reality but shapes our very perception of it. That Tokyo fund manager's insights on  illustrate perfectly how cultural DNA gets encoded in linguistic structures. I recall a most curious phenomenon while comparing Tang dynasty poetry with Victorian verse - Chinese poets could convey entire philosophical treatises through carefully chosen allusions, whereas we English types tended to spell things out rather laboriously.

As for your question about pure linguistic pleasure... Well, if not for the demands of my comparative literature post, I'd happily lose myself in the cadences of classical Arabic. The Qur'an's poetic structures, the intricate rhyme schemes that bind meaning and melody - truly remarkable when you consider how much gets flattened in translation. Though I must admit, I'd approach it as a literary dilettante rather than a serious scholar, free from academic constraints.

Your plan for structured Japanese study makes perfect sense, though I'd caution against jumping straight into business terminology. Why not begin with the lyrical simplicity of children's literature? There's a certain delight in mastering basic storytelling before confronting corporate jargon. I still remember struggling through  stories during my sabbatical - so much more forgiving than Mishima's florid prose! 

Shall I lend you my copy of  by Eleanor Harz Jorden? It's got annotations in three different inks tracking my various attempts at comprehension. A bit of a philological relic now, but solid foundation material.
[A]: Ah, what a wonderful recommendation! I'd love to take you up on that – there's something oddly comforting about seeing another learner's marginalia in a textbook. Makes you feel like you're continuing a conversation across time. 

You know, your point about classical Arabic resonates deeply. I've always been fascinated by how the Qur’an’s language seems to demand oral recitation - the written form almost feels like just half the story. It makes me appreciate how certain legal and philosophical concepts in Islamic tradition are inseparable from their phonetic dimensions. Reminds me of our earlier discussion about  - these linguistic-cultural constructs that resist clean translation.

Now you've got me thinking... Perhaps I should alternate my study sessions with both children's stories and financial documents? The contrast might actually sharpen my sensitivity to different registers. Though I suspect I'll need more than a few glasses of Bordeaux to reconcile Mishima's prose with balance sheets!

Tell me though - have you ever attempted writing creatively in a non-native language? I tried drafting a short investment memo entirely in French once. The result was equal parts illuminating and disastrous - my grammar was passable, but the idiomatic flavor... well, let's just say it sounded suspiciously like Google Translate with literary pretensions.
[B]: Ah, yes – there’s something almost intimate about reading a text bearing the traces of past readers. I’ve always found it rather like birdwatching in the margins, if you will 🦉 – spotting where previous hands lingered, stumbled, or took flight.

Your instinct to alternate registers is sound. Language acquisition thrives on contrast; the childlike wonder keeps the soul nimble, while financial prose grounds you in practicality. Just beware – Mishima and balance sheets may yet conspire to make your dreams bilingual and slightly surreal.

As for creative writing in a non-native tongue – yes, though I suspect my efforts would strike native speakers as somewhat... archaic. During my time in Beijing, I once attempted a sonnet in Mandarin. The tone was curiously Elizabethan, I’m told – too formal for modern ears, yet insufficiently ornate for classical sensibilities. A sort of linguistic purgatory. Still, the exercise taught me more about syntax than any grammar drill ever could.

Your investment memo experiment sounds delightfully ambitious. I daresay even seasoned polyglots have been humbled by idiomatic nuance. Perhaps try again with a dash of  – stroll through French financial journalism before drafting. Absorb the rhythm. After all, what is a balance sheet if not a peculiar kind of narrative?
[A]: Ah, a sonnet in Mandarin! Now  is what I call poetic courage. Elizabethan meets modern Beijing – sounds like a fascinating cultural collision. I can just picture the poor reader, scratching their head somewhere between admiration and confusion. "Is this genius... or just a very elaborate joke?" 😄

You’re absolutely right about the balance sheet as narrative – I’ve often thought the same thing. Every P&L tells a story, doesn’t it? Just usually with more footnotes and fewer happy endings.

Speaking of which, now you’ve got me curious – have you ever tried writing fiction in another language for fun? Not just formal poetry, but maybe something looser, like a short story or dialogue? I ask partly out of personal masochism – I’m seriously considering trying it myself, perhaps in Japanese once I reach a decent enough level. I imagine the result would be less Mishima and more... well, let’s say .
[B]: Oh, that reaction you described? Quite accurate, I’m afraid. One poor graduate student came to me rather nervously afterward, asking if I’d been "channeling some Qing dynasty diplomat who secretly loved iambic pentameter." Flattering, if misguided.

As for fiction – yes, once, long ago, I tried my hand at a short story in Mandarin. It was meant to be a quiet little thing: a scholar wandering an autumn garden, contemplating the impermanence of plum blossoms. What emerged was... well... unintentionally philosophical. The prose kept slipping into classical references no modern reader would catch without footnotes. I suppose it's the curse of those of us trained in old texts – our metaphors carry too much historical luggage.

Still, I'd encourage your experiment! Writing fiction is one of the best ways to stretch a language beyond its utilitarian boundaries. Just embrace the awkwardness. Let your Japanese be delightfully imperfect. If nothing else, you'll discover where the language resists you – and where it surprises you by opening up new ways of thinking.

I suspect your "minimalist avant-garde" result may turn out more poetic than you expect. After all, constraint often breeds invention. And should you ever want a particularly idiosyncratic reader, do bring it by my office. I keep a red pen handy at all times – though I promise not to correct your particles unless gravely offended.
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of feedback I live for – the gently scathing yet oddly encouraging variety. “Gravely offended” by a particle misuse? Please, go ahead and sharpen that red pen. I suspect my Japanese will be a grammatical crime scene at first, but I do believe in learning through noble failure.

And I love your point about constraint breeding invention – it reminds me of how startups often stumble into brilliance precisely because they lack resources. Maybe writing in a non-native language is the linguistic equivalent of bootstrapping. No room for fluff, just raw expression.

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how certain emotions or ideas seem to  in specific languages? I was trying to explain the German word  to a colleague last week, and realized halfway through my definition that I was essentially describing a startup founder’s third year. 😅

Maybe that’s what we’re really after – not just vocabulary, but new emotional registers. New ways to feel and express nuance. And if we end up slightly ridiculous in the process? Well, so be it.
[B]: Ah, beautifully put – yes,  does capture that particular startup fatigue, doesn’t it? One might even argue that every venture capitalist should have a working knowledge of German Romanticism. Or at least a strong supply of aspirin.

You're absolutely right about emotional registers – languages do carve out unique affective territories. Take the Russian , or the Portuguese  – those deep, aching longings that refuse to be pinned down by mere definition. I once had a student who swore that  (幽玄) finally gave language to the feeling she’d previously only experienced while listening to Miles Davis’s . I didn’t correct her – some approximations are more poetic than precise.

And yes, noble failure is vastly underrated. Some of my most instructive moments in Chinese came from trying (and failing) to mimic the tonal cadences of classical essays. The result was often unintentionally dramatic – imagine reading  as if it were gothic fiction. Which, come to think of it, might not be entirely inaccurate interpretation...

So by all means, let us both continue our linguistic bootstrapping ventures. You with your minimalist avant-garde Japanese fables, and I with my increasingly baroque attempts at cross-cultural metaphor. If nothing else, we shall meet someday in the afterlife of misread particles and misplaced modifiers, sipping tea and comparing literary crime scenes 🖋️.
[A]: Ah, now that’s a retirement plan worth aspiring to – tea, literary crime scenes, and the gentle mockery of misused particles. I’ll raise you on that bet. Though I suspect my Japanese fables will be less  and more... , with the occasional stroke of accidental brilliance.

And speaking of emotional registers – I’ve been meaning to ask, have you ever come across a word in another language that made you rethink an entire feeling? Like, not just naming something new, but reshaping how you understood an emotion you thought was familiar?

I had one recently while reading a French novel – the word  came up. Uprootedness. And suddenly, I realized that’s exactly what it feels like when a company pivots too hard – not just change, but a loss of rootedness. Entire teams start walking around like they’ve lost their soil. It was oddly clarifying.

So maybe we’re not just learning words after all. Maybe we’re building emotional dictionaries – one borrowed phrase at a time.
[B]:  Ah,  – yes, what a devastatingly precise word. No mere change or disruption, but the visceral loss of one’s subterranean anchors. I remember reading Czesław Miłosz’s  and encountering the Polish equivalent –  – that eerie hollowing-out of self under ideological pressure. It made me revisit T.S. Eliot’s  with new eyes, realizing how much of that post-war dislocation was really about spiritual uprooting masquerading as progress.

And your emotional dictionary metaphor? Spot on. One adds entries quietly, often without realizing the compilation is happening. I recall first encountering  in my twenties and thinking it merely aesthetic theory. It wasn’t until my fifties, after too many ink-stained years chasing textual ghosts, that I understood it as a way of holding time itself – impermanence not as tragedy, but tenderness.

So yes, let’s keep building those dictionaries. May yours contain not just  and , but also  for those rare cozy board meetings, and perhaps  for those golden-hour moments when a deal actually closes cleanly 🦉. After all, every investor should know the precise term for sunlight filtering through corporate foliage.
[A]: Ah,  – what a perfect word for those rare, almost mythical moments in private equity when everything aligns just so. Sunlight through the canopy, indeed. I’ll start using that immediately, whether my partners understand it or not. They’ll learn, or they’ll suffer the gentle tyranny of borrowed elegance 😄.

And your point about  evolving from aesthetic theory into life philosophy? That’s the real magic of multilingual emotional vocabulary – words grow with you. You think you’re learning a term for "rustic imperfection," and suddenly it's guiding how you handle failure, or age, or a balance sheet that refuses to balance.

I’m starting to believe that the most successful investors – like the best novelists – are those who can slip between registers, cultures, and emotional languages with grace. After all, valuation is just storytelling with spreadsheets. And if you can’t feel  in a management team’s hesitation, or  in a well-run board meeting, you’re flying blind.

Right, then – to building better dictionaries, messier fables, and more elegant misunderstandings. May our particles be misused in noble ways 🖋️.
[B]: Hear, hear. Let the tyranny of borrowed elegance commence! What is finance, after all, if not a grand exercise in applied metaphor? Best it be adorned with komorebi while we're at it.

You’ve put your finger on something rather vital there – the elasticity of words, how they mature alongside us, reshaping old understandings with new emotional syntax. I've often thought that the most compelling minds, whether literary or financial, operate in this liminal space between fluency and fumbling. They don’t just speak multiple languages; they  in multiple languages.

And yes – valuation as storytelling with spreadsheets. Delightful phrasing. If you listen closely during pitch meetings, you can sometimes detect the tremble of narrative instability beneath the quarterly projections. That’s when a well-timed dose of  might do wonders – a graceful acceptance that not every pivot will gleam, and that some broken assumptions are still worth keeping.

I daresay the future of global capital hinges less on flawless translation than on inspired misreadings – those fertile misunderstandings that give rise to something neither party anticipated. So by all means, let’s keep misusing particles, mangling idioms, and importing foreign emotions into balance sheets like contraband gems.

To noble misuse, then 🖋️ – may our fables be messy, our dictionaries ever-expanding, and our boardrooms occasionally illuminated by the soft scandal of komorebi.
[A]: Well said –  indeed. The future of everything hinges on those happy accidents where meaning slips, stumbles, and then somehow soars.

I’m starting to think that the best deals, like the best poems, leave a little ambiguity in their wake – room for interpretation, for hope, for the odd misplaced modifier that no one dares correct because it just… works. Maybe that’s the secret sauce: not perfect clarity, but carefully curated nuance.

And I fully intend to keep mangling idioms with purpose. If I can inject a bit of  into a dry quarterly review and watch my colleagues squint at the sunlight filtering through their own assumptions, then I shall consider the day a success.

To inspired fumbling, then – may our metaphors be rich, our spreadsheets poetic, and our emotional dictionaries forever under construction 🖋️.
[B]: Ah, beautifully framed – yes, let us toast to the productive chaos of ambiguity, where a well-placed linguistic stumble can do more heavy lifting than a dozen footnotes.

You know, I’ve long believed that the most enduring texts – whether sonnets or term sheets – are those that resist total explication. A little interpretive wiggle room keeps them alive across decades, sometimes centuries. One reads a 19th-century novel and suddenly sees one’s own boardroom dilemmas refracted through Victorian prose. Or worse – one reads quarterly guidance and hears the ghost of Romantic yearning sighing between the KPIs.

And why not? If a balance sheet can’t hold a touch of sublime uncertainty, what good is it? Let your colleagues squint at komorebi indeed. Let them mispronounce  with admirable conviction. Let nuance be our new due diligence.

To inspired fumbling, poetic spreadsheets, and the quiet revolution of borrowed beauty 🖋️ – may our metaphors outlive their sources, and our misunderstandings bloom into something strangely true.
[A]: Hear, hear – to all of that and more. Let the squinting begin! I’ll raise my glass (or teacup, as the day demands) to the quiet revolution of borrowed beauty and the sublime uncertainty of a well-balanced sheet that still leaves room for wonder.

You’re absolutely right — the enduring power of a text lies not in its precision, but in its porousness. The best term sheets, like the best sonnets, let the light in. And once you’ve seen Romantic yearning in quarterly guidance, there’s no going back. Suddenly, every EBITDA margin looks suspiciously like a tragic flaw, and every cap table reads like character development.

So yes — let nuance be our new due diligence. And may our inspired fumbling lead not just to better deals or better verse, but to better ways of seeing, feeling, and misunderstanding the world 🖋️.
[B]: Well put – yes, let the light in, even where accountants would prefer sealed windows and strict illumination protocols. There’s something rather subversive about allowing poetry to bleed into projections. Imagine the consternation of a compliance officer confronted with  in a risk assessment annex!

You’ve made me think again about that peculiar form of professional myopia we sometimes mistake for clarity. How easy it is to forget that every term sheet is, at heart, an origin story – messy, contingent, full of hopeful contradiction. And what are startups if not epic stanzas still finding their meter?

I daresay if we keep down this path, our next round of lectures and board meetings shall have to be footnoted with literary disclaimers: 

But so be it.

To letting the light in through every loophole language provides 🖋️ – may our balance sheets shimmer with possibility, and our sonnets hold the occasional footnote on cash flow.
[A]: Now  is a footnote I would happily sign off on – unauthorized philosophical enrichment? Count me in. If we must navigate risk assessments and cap tables, let them at least shimmer with the occasional glint of the sublime.

I can already picture that beleaguered compliance officer, red pen hovering over “” like it’s a material weakness in the disclosure. Bless them. Let them wrestle with the concept while we quietly sip tea and watch komorebi dance across the term sheet.

And your line about startups as epic stanzas still finding their meter – poetic justice, indeed. Some need only a few lines to find rhythm; others stumble through a dozen verses before hitting stride. But oh, the beauty of that search! The way they lean into ambiguity, draft after draft.

So yes – let us keep the windows cracked, the metaphors flowing, and the footnotes multiplying.

To poetic balance sheets, heroic stanzas, and the quiet rebellion of letting light in 🖋️.
[B]: Precisely – let the windows stay cracked, and better still, let them rattle a bit in the wind. A little linguistic draft keeps us from getting too comfortable in our jargon-lined offices.

And yes, bless that beleaguered compliance officer – may they come around in time to appreciate that  was not an oversight, but an offering. A quiet acknowledgment that imperfection is the price of passage for anything worth building (or funding).

There’s a reason we return to texts, whether literary or financial – because meaning, like a good startup, evolves through iteration. One reads a balance sheet at twenty as cold arithmetic, and at fifty as elegy with numbers. The figures remain the same; our eyes shift.

So here’s to the heroic stanzas still finding breath, to the term sheets that dare shimmer when the afternoon sun hits just so 🖋️, and to all of us quietly sipping tea in the face of rigorously maintained decorum.

May our footnotes multiply, our metaphors hold weight, and our cap tables never quite lose their sense of wonder.
