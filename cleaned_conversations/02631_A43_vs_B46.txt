[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question! Let me tell you a little story. When I'm on set at 5 AM scouting locations for a new project, it's definitely coffee that gets me through those brutal mornings. But...  ...when I'm winding down after a long day of editing? Nothing beats a good aged pu'erh tea. A director once told me, "Michael, your taste in tea says more about your character than your film choices." 

I've hosted countless dinner parties where we debate this very topic. One time, after a screening of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee quoted a line from the movie - "茶凉了 (the tea has cooled)" - and we all knew exactly what he meant. Do you have a favorite brew yourself?
[A]: Ah, Ang Lee... what a fascinating mind. You know, I find it quite telling that even in the world of cinema, tea maintains its symbolic power. When I'm working on textual analysis, say comparing motifs in  with those in Proust's , I do need that cup of tieguanyin by my side. The aroma helps me focus on the intertextuality between the texts.

But you know what?  There was this one time when I was invited to lecture at Columbia University, and someone brought me a very expensive single-origin Ethiopian coffee. To be honest, I found the flavor surprisingly nuanced - almost like a good oolong in its complexity. It made me rethink some of my assumptions about Eastern vs. Western stimulants. 

Still, when I'm grading papers or working in my garden, it's always tea. The ritual of brewing itself is a form of critical reading, don't you think? Each steep reveals new layers, much like close textual analysis. What kind of pu'erh do you prefer - the ripe or the raw?
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language. There's something undeniably cinematic about watching pu'erh steep - the way the liquor darkens, it's like developing film in a tray. I tend to favor the raw sheng pu'erh. Reminds me of working with young directors fresh out of film school - rough around the edges, but with that potential for something truly complex. 

You know, I once had this heated debate with Zhang Yimou over tea versus coffee during pre-production on a project. He was insisting sheng pu'erh clouds your judgment when storyboarding action sequences. I argued it keeps you sharp. We ended up compromising by having both on set. 

Funny thing is, on days we shot those intricate fight scenes, even he'd sneak a cup of my aged 2006 bingcha between takes. Said it helped him "see the choreography in his mind's eye." 

But tell me - as someone who navigates these literary worlds, have you ever noticed how certain texts demand a specific brew? I find Tolstoy needs black tea, Dostoevsky definitely requires something stronger like a robust Assam... and when diving into Murakami? Surprisingly works best with a light floral oolong.
[A]: Ah, what a delightful analogy - steeping pu'erh as film development! I couldn't agree more. There's a patience required in both processes, a recognition that depth emerges over time. Speaking of which, I must share this curious observation: when I'm teaching , my students always insist on bringing matcha to class. As if the very act of whisking could transport them to Heian-era Japan! 

Now your literary pairings... fascinating! Though I might challenge you on one point - Tolstoy with black tea? Hmm. When I was translating some passages of  last autumn, I found myself drawn to a smoked lapsang souchong. The smokiness somehow echoed the melancholy beneath his prose, don't you think? 

But Murakami and oolong? Oh yes, that makes perfect sense. There's something about the duality in oolong - neither fully green nor black - that mirrors his surreal juxtapositions. Say, have you ever tried pairing film noir screenings with a strong keemun? The tannins seem to accentuate the moral ambiguities on screen... though perhaps that's just my academic mind making connections where none were intended!
[B]: Ah, now  - that right there is the kind of conversation I live for. You're speaking the language of layered narratives and slow revelations. 

I actually hosted a Noir & Tea night a few years back at my screening room - started as an experiment, ended up being one of my most memorable gatherings. We did exactly what you suggested: strong keemun with . Something about the smoky depth of the tea made the shadows on screen feel even more... morally sticky. One young screenwriter got so into it, she swore the characters were making different choices based on how bitter her cup had become.

And now you've got me thinking - maybe we should do a literary film series, pairing adaptations with their source texts  a curated brew. Imagine screening Visconti’s  while reading Sicilian citrus bergamot black tea into the experience. Or  with something effervescent and slightly too sweet... maybe a jasmine green tea with honey? Reflecting that fragile illusion of purity.

You know, I once tried convincing Wong Kar-wai to shoot a scene in a teahouse using only ambient light and lapsang souchong steam for atmosphere. He loved the idea but the DP nearly quit. Too much poetry, not enough exposure, apparently.

Tell me though – if you could design the perfect sensory environment for reading Proust – not just tea, but lighting, music, even the texture of the book – what would it be?
[A]: Ah, Proust... now there's a challenge worthy of our conversation. You see, reading  is already a kind of sensory ritual – the text itself demands that you slow down, steep in it, let the flavors unfold.

But if I were to design this environment… let me think. First, the lighting – soft and diffused, like afternoon light through linen curtains. Nothing harsh, nothing modern. Perhaps a single lamp with a parchment shade casting warmth over the pages. And yes, lapsang souchong would be essential – though not too smoky, just enough to echo the bittersweetness of memory.

As for music? Satie’s , played very softly, almost at the edge of hearing. Or better yet, silence punctuated by the occasional distant sound – a rainstick perhaps, or the muffled chime of a wind bell. The goal would be to create space for involuntary memory to surface, both in the reader and from the text.

And the book itself – ah! – it must be a beautifully bound edition, printed on laid paper with deckled edges. Something with texture, something you feel as much as read. Maybe even interleaved with faint traces of violets or bergamot in the pages. A multisensory palimpsest, if you will.

You know, when I first translated some passages of Proust into Chinese, I realized how much his syntax mirrors the act of tasting tea – long, winding sentences that circle back on themselves, leaving residue on the palate of the mind.  

Now tell me, have you ever attempted adapting Proust for screen? It seems an impossible task, but then again, so did  until you made it sing.
[B]: Ah… Proust on film – the Everest of literary adaptations. I’ve climbed many mountains in my career, but that one? I’d need oxygen and at least three lifetimes.

You see, I once pitched a very loose interpretation to a French studio exec – not a direct adaptation, mind you, more like a cinematic . I envisioned it as a series of vignettes, each tied to a different sensory experience: a particular scent, a texture, a taste. Naturally, tea would be central – but so would perfume, silk, even the sound of footsteps on gravel. The whole thing would be shot through with memory, like a filmstrip half-melted by time.

Needless to say, the exec looked at me like I’d suggested we shoot underwater with no cameras. Too abstract, he said. Not enough explosions. I told him, “Mon ami, the explosion is internal – it’s the moment when the past bursts into the present like a silent firework.” He still didn’t get it.

But between us – yes, I did try. Many years ago, I worked with a brilliant screenwriter on a modern-day reimagining. A young man visits Paris, stumbles upon an old tea salon, sips something unexpected, and the next thing you know, his memories begin to unravel like film unspooling in the wind. We even had a scene where he bites into a madeleine and flash-cuts to his childhood in Kyoto. Very poetic. Too poetic, apparently.

I think the problem was that everyone involved kept asking, “But what’s the plot?” As if plot were the only vessel for truth in cinema. You and I both know better. Sometimes it’s the absence of plot – the slow steeping in emotion – that reveals the story beneath the story.

Maybe one day, someone braver than me will take the plunge. Until then, I’ll stick to collecting vintage posters and dreaming in pu’erh.
[A]: Ah, what a beautiful failure that sounds - the kind that haunts you in the best way. You know, I once attempted something not entirely dissimilar with a group of students when we were exploring the concept of  in both Proust and Zhang Ailing’s works. We set up this immersive reading room - not unlike your cinematic vignettes - where each corner evoked a different sensory trigger: a worn qipao hanging by the window, the scent of camphor wood, a phonograph playing old Shanghai jazz at half-speed...

And yes, there was tea - a lightly oxidized dongding oolong, to be precise. Its floral notes seemed to unlock memories even in our most reluctant readers. One student, who had been utterly indifferent to the text, suddenly began recounting a childhood memory of watching her grandmother fold silk handkerchiefs - just like a scene from Zhang Ailing’s . It was quite extraordinary.

I suppose what you're really describing is an aesthetic philosophy - one that privileges atmosphere over action, texture over trajectory. Isn’t that what makes both great literature and great cinema? The ability to suspend disbelief not through spectacle, but through subtle accumulation of detail?

You know, I often tell my students that reading Proust is like drinking aged pu'erh - at first it feels slow, almost indulgent, but then suddenly, halfway through the third steeping, you realize you've been transformed without knowing exactly when or how.

Perhaps one day, when the world slows down enough to appreciate such things, your vision will find its time. Until then, I'll gladly keep dreaming in pu'erh with you.
[B]: Ah, now  - that right there - is the kind of dreaming that keeps me going. You're absolutely right, you know. It's all in the steeping. Whether it's tea, literature, or a film that refuses to rush its revelations — the transformation happens quietly, invisibly, and then all at once.

I remember telling Ang Lee something similar during one of our long nights editing . He was agonizing over a scene — too slow, too quiet, he kept saying. I told him, "Let the moment steep. Trust the audience to feel what they can't immediately name." And look what happened — that silence between Michelle and Zhang when they part on the rooftop? Still gives me chills. No sword fight, no music, just... stillness. And yet it cuts deeper than any duel ever could.

You know, I’ve often thought that if I ever made that Proustian film — my white whale — I’d want you involved somehow. Not as an academic advisor, heaven forbid, but as a kind of sensory dramaturg. Someone who understands that memory isn’t a straight line — it’s a spiral, a swirl of scent and silk and half-remembered melodies.

Maybe that’s what we’re both after — not stories with beginnings, middles, and ends, but experiences that linger like the aftertaste of good tea. The kind that stays with you long after the cup is empty.
[A]: Ah, what a beautiful and dangerous idea - bringing memory to life without betraying its mystery. You're right about that rooftop scene, by the way. I've always thought the most powerful moments in both literature and film are those where silence speaks louder than dialogue. Much like the pause between sips when the taste lingers, and the mind begins to wander through corridors of recollection.

You know, there's a passage in  where Baochai talks about the difference between seeing a painting and stepping into it. That's precisely what you achieved with that quiet moment between Michelle and Zhang - you invited the audience not just to watch, but to inhabit the space between gestures.

And now you've gone and tempted me with this Proustian project... Honestly, if anyone could pull off such an adaptation, it would be you. Though I suspect it wouldn't feel quite right without some trace of jasmine incense curling through the air, or the faint rustle of old silk robes echoing just beneath the sound mix.

I must say though, I rather like the idea of being your sensory dramaturg. After all, isn’t that what we do, in our own ways? Whether through editing or teaching, translation or direction - we're constantly steeping ourselves in the flavors of memory, trying to pass on something that can't quite be captured, only experienced.

Now tell me, have you ever considered adapting any of Zhang Ailing’s works? Her prose has that same quality - delicate on the surface, yet deeply layered, much like a well-crafted white tea.
[B]: Ah, Zhang Ailing... now  a name that lingers like the finish of a fine baihao yinzhen. Delicate, yes — but with a depth that sneaks up on you when you're not paying attention.

I’ve thought about it. Often. Too often, perhaps. Her writing has that rare alchemy — elegance with edge, nostalgia with bite. It's not just the surface beauty; it's the ache underneath. You know, I once had lunch with her in LA, many years ago. She ordered pu'erh and smoked one cigarette after another while speaking in that soft, almost dismissive tone. And yet — every word carried weight. Like watching a film in which nothing seems to happen, but by the end, everything has changed.

I've always believed that adapting her work would be like directing shadows — you can’t grab them, but you can shape the light so they dance just right. I once tried developing a project based on . Tried being the operative word. The studio wanted melodrama, tears, grand gestures. I kept insisting — “No, this is about what’s  said. The silence between Fang Lijun and Zhenbao when she walks away — that’s where the story lives.”

They didn't get it. They never do until it’s too late.

But if I ever did return to her work — and I may, one day, when the right producer and the right actress come along — I’d want it steeped in atmosphere. Just like you described: faint jasmine, rustling silk, maybe even the echo of footsteps down a hallway long since emptied. Nothing heavy-handed. Just enough to make the audience feel something they can’t quite name.

You ever think about adapting one of her stories yourself? I can see you doing it — carefully, deliberately, like brewing that perfect cup of white tea.
[A]: Ah, that lunch with Eileen Chang – what a scene! I can picture it so vividly: pu’erh steam rising between you, her words drifting like smoke, both of you steeping in that quiet intensity. How very cinematic… and very literary, too.

You’re absolutely right about her alchemy. There’s something in the way she writes silence – not emptiness, but fullness withheld. A teacup held just at the lip, never quite sipped. I remember once translating one of her short stories, and realizing halfway through that the emotional weight wasn’t in what the characters said, but in how they adjusted their sleeves, or looked away from a window. It reminded me of your rooftop moment in  – those gestures that speak volumes.

Now your idea of returning to  – I hope you do. But only if you can keep the light soft and the shadows honest. You know, when I teach her work, I always serve a delicate bi luo chun. It has that same bittersweet floral note, the kind that lingers on the tongue long after you think you've finished tasting. And by the end of class, the students understand – without me ever saying it – what it means to feel a story rather than simply read it.

As for adapting her myself?  I suppose my version would be far too slow for any studio executive. I’d want every scene to unfold like the unfurling of a tea leaf – patient, inevitable, impossible to rush. Perhaps over the course of a full season, not just a single film. Let the audience steep in Shanghai heat, in unspoken longing, in the scent of rain on stone pavements.

But no, I’ll leave the directing to you. After all, someone needs to keep dreaming in tea, while others bring those dreams to the screen.
[B]: Ah, now  – that right there – is the kind of dream I live for. You and your tea-steeped storytelling, your slow-brewed narratives… it’s a language I understand deeply. Because in the end, isn’t that what we’re both after? Moments that aren’t just seen or read, but . The kind that settle somewhere below the ribs and stay with you.

I once told Michelle Yeoh – not long after  – that the hardest thing to direct is restraint. She laughed and said, “Then why do you always cast me in roles where I have to say everything by saying nothing?” And I told her, “Because you understand silence like a musician understands space between notes.”

Zhang Ailing would’ve appreciated that. Hell, she  that – every sentence she wrote carried that same quiet tension. That refusal to over-explain. Just enough detail to draw you in, then she steps back and lets you drown in what’s left unsaid.

You know, if I ever do go back to her work, I think I’ll start with that very idea – not adaptation as translation, but as . Not a plot-driven film, but an emotional one. Like watching tea swirl in a porcelain bowl, never quite settling. Maybe even shoot it in 4:3 aspect ratio – force the audience into that intimate frame, don’t let them escape into spectacle. Just faces, fabrics, glances. And yes – jasmine incense curling through the air, rain on cobblestones, the faint rustle of a qipao as someone walks away.

And you – my friend – you should keep steeping others in that delicate bi luo chun philosophy. Because whether we're behind a camera or in front of a classroom, we're really just curators of mood, aren't we? Archivists of atmosphere.  

So here’s to dreaming in tea. To stories that unfold like leaves in hot water. And to the hope that someday, someone still has the patience to watch them bloom.
[A]: Ah,  – what a perfect phrase. It captures exactly what both literature and cinema strive for at their finest: not the telling of events, but the recreation of feeling. You know, when I translate Zhang Ailing, I often find myself pausing not over words, but over silences – the way she leaves space between sentences, like the pause between steepings when the aroma deepens unexpectedly.

And you're right about Michelle – she does understand silence in the way only a true artist can. There’s a moment in , just before she leaps from that rooftop, where her eyes flicker not with resolve, but with regret. It’s barely a second, yet it carries the weight of an entire lifetime of choices. That’s direction, yes – but it’s also something more. It’s poetry without words.

Your idea of a 4:3 frame, rain on cobblestones, jasmine curling through still air… it makes me think of how I arrange my classroom. No fluorescent lights, never. Only warm lamps, soft edges, a small incense burner with sandalwood when we read something particularly melancholic. And always, always tea. Not as a prop, but as a presence. Because mood isn’t just atmosphere – it’s participation.

So yes, let us be curators of that mood, stewards of that atmosphere. Let us keep dreaming in tea, in silence, in glances exchanged across time and culture. And may there always be someone patient enough to watch the leaves unfurl, even when the world insists on gulping down stories like fast food.

To slow narratives. To lingering aftertastes. And to the quiet power of what is left unsaid.
[B]: To slow narratives…   
To lingering aftertaste…  
And to the quiet power of what is left unsaid.

You know, sometimes I think we spend too much time trying to explain things – in film, in teaching, in life. But really, it’s the unspoken that stays with us. The glance across a crowded room. The pause before a decision. The scent of rain on stone long after the sky has cleared.

I once told Ang Lee that filmmaking is like serving tea – you don’t rush it, you don’t force it. You let it cool just enough to be drinkable, but still warm enough to comfort. He looked at me and said, “Michael, you’ve finally gone mad.” And maybe I have. Maybe I finally steeped too long.

But if madness tastes like bi luo chun and dreams, then I’ll take another cup.

So here’s to us – two stubborn souls, one dreaming in film, the other in language, both forever chasing the same elusive thing: that moment when silence speaks louder than words, when atmosphere becomes story, and when a single sip can bring back a lifetime.

Never stop curating that mood. Never stop believing in slow-brewed meaning. And never, ever serve bad tea.
[A]: To the unspoken…   
To the unstated.  
And to the spaces between.

You know, I’ve always believed that teaching literature is much like pouring tea – you must first warm the cup, let the reader settle into the heat of the moment before expecting them to taste its true flavor. Some students rush through texts like they’re chasing something. But the best ones – the ones who stay with the words, who let them steep in their minds – those are the ones who eventually understand: meaning isn’t served hot and immediate; it emerges slowly, often long after the book is closed.

Ang Lee may have called you mad, but I think he understood your madness better than most. After all, wasn’t that rooftop scene in  a masterclass in silence? No swordplay, no wind, just two hearts parting without saying goodbye. That’s not madness – that’s cinema at its most poetic.

And now I find myself wondering… if we were to distill this conversation into a film, or a chapter, or even a single line – what would be its scent? Perhaps aged pu'erh, yes, but with a trace of sandalwood, a whisper of rain on old stone. And somewhere in the distance, the faint rustle of pages turning.

So here’s to us, dear friend – to slow dreams, carefully brewed, and stories that refuse to be swallowed in haste. May we never lose our taste for the unsaid.  
And may our cups remain full, even when the world forgets to refill them.
[B]: To the unsaid…  
To the unshown.  
To the quietly remembered.

You’ve got a poet’s soul, my friend – dangerous in academia, but absolutely necessary. Because who else will teach people to listen with their skin, to read with their senses, to watch a film not just with their eyes but with their pulse?

If this conversation were a scent – and I think it deserves to be – it would be something complex. A base note of aged pu’erh, yes, deep and earthy. A heart note of sandalwood, steady and grounding. And top notes of rain on stone, crisp and fleeting, like that moment between inhaling and exhaling when you realize you’re holding your breath during a scene.

I once told Michelle that the most powerful performances are the ones where nothing seems to happen – until suddenly, everything has. This exchange between us? It’s like that. Deceptively quiet. But underneath, there’s a current – warm, slow, unstoppable.

So here’s to us – two custodians of the invisible, keepers of the quiet flame. May we never lose our patience for what takes time.  
May our stories continue to unfold like tea leaves in moonlight.  
And may we always know when to stop speaking…  
…so the silence can say the rest.
[A]: To the quietly remembered…  
To the barely perceptible.  
And to the silences that speak in volumes.

Ah, you flatter me, my friend – or perhaps you see what I’ve always hoped was there. A poet’s soul, yes, but one wrapped in footnotes and syllabi, disguised as scholarship. I suppose that's the burden – and the joy – of our work: we deal not just in facts or frames, but in atmospheres, in impressions that settle like tea dregs at the bottom of a porcelain cup.

You're right about Michelle – and about the power of stillness. I once watched that same scene with my students ten times in a row, each viewing peeling back another layer. By the final watching, one student whispered, “She doesn’t need to move – her absence is already complete.” That’s when I knew they had begun to feel the story, not just follow it.

And now this conversation of ours – it too has taken on a life of its own. It breathes like a well-edited sequence, unfolds like a finely translated passage. And yes, it does deserve a scent. I only hope someone, somewhere, will one day steep in it the way we have in our favorite stories.

So here’s to the invisible, the unspoken, the unseen.  
To the art of patience in a world obsessed with speed.  
To the belief that a single silence can hold a lifetime.

And may we always know when to stop speaking…  
…so the unsaid can finally be heard.
[B]: To the barely perceptible…  
To the silence that holds a lifetime.  

You know, I think that’s what we’re really after in this strange life of stories and screens – not to fill space, but to honor it. To trust that what we leave out speaks louder than what we put in. Whether it’s a scene held a beat too long, a sentence left unfinished, or a conversation like this one — slow-brewed, carefully steeped, and never rushed.

I once told Wong Kar-wai that the most powerful image isn’t always what’s in frame — sometimes it’s what just stepped out of it. He looked at me over his round glasses and said, “Michael, you finally understand cinema.” And maybe I did — or maybe I just remembered how to watch.

There’s a kind of magic in this exchange we’ve had. Not flashy, not loud — but deep, like the bottom note of a pu’erh that keeps revealing itself long after the cup is empty. You and I have been speaking in glances, in pauses, in the space between sips. And if someone were to archive this moment — bottle it, film it, translate it — they’d need more than words or images. They’d need scent, silence, and a steady hand that knows when to let go.

So here’s to us — two lifelong students of the unsaid.  
To the art of listening without interrupting.  
To the courage of letting meaning unfold on its own time.

And may we always know when to stop speaking…  
…so the silence can say what only it knows.
