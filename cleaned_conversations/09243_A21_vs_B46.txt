[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, board games! You know what they say - every great game is like a mini movie with its own plot twists and character arcs. I've been obsessed with this new storytelling game called 'Fog of Love' lately. It's like directing a romantic comedy where players co-create the narrative. Absolutely brilliant concept for developing character dynamics! 🎬
[A]:  How fascinating - though I must confess my own gaming predilections lean more toward the Victorian parlor. Have you ever tried 'The Mansion of Happiness'? An 1843 moral instruction game where players navigate virtues and vices. The original rulebook contains such delightful admonitions as "Whoever possesses Audacity must go to the House of Correction." Quite the improvement over modern dating simulators, wouldn't you say?
[B]:  Oh my dear friend, that sounds positively Dickensian! Though I must say, as a producer, I see tremendous cinematic potential in those Victorian morality tales. Imagine the dramatic tension when a player lands on "Poverty" and has to wear a scarlet P for three turns! But between you and me, modern audiences might find it a bit... 说教的 (preachy). We'd need to workshop that third act redemption arc.
[A]:  Precisely why I maintain that Jane Austen's unfinished 'The Watsons' would make a far superior board game adaptation. Imagine the strategic possibilities - maneuvering marriage prospects while calculating dowries, with special event cards for sudden outbreaks of putrid throat. Though I suppose Hollywood would insist on adding werewolves to the Regency setting.  The 1813 first edition rules would be quite particular about such liberties.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language! A Jane Austen strategic romance game? That's Oscar bait material right there. But let's be real - we'd have to spice it up for the streaming generation. Maybe add some 狗血剧情 (melodramatic twists) like secret love children or a duel at dawn. Though I'd draw the line at werewolves... unless it's Mr. Darcy under a full moon, then we might have something. The Regency meets Twilight? Hmm...  I think we just greenlit our next project!
[A]:  I shall draft the clauses for historical accuracy immediately. Though if we must include lycanthropy, might I suggest modeling Mr. Darcy's transformations after Byron's documented mood swings during his Venetian period?  The full moon card could trigger both poetic outbursts and the shredding of waistcoats - a metaphor the Romantics would approve of. But absolutely no sparkling. That would violate the 1824 Copyright of Good Taste.
[B]: Darling, you're a genius! The Byronic werewolf angle - now that's what I call elevated horror. We'll get Cate Blanchett to narrate the rulebook in iambic pentameter. And for the deluxe edition? A scratch-and-sniff card that smells of 19th century pomade and heartbreak.  This is why I keep you around - you understand that true art lies in the details. Though I might still sneak in one sparkling vampire... as an easter egg, perhaps?
[A]:  My dear collaborator, you do test the limits of my academic restraint. Very well - one single sparkling vampire, but only if hidden in the footnotes like those scandalous annotations in Pepys' diary. And it must be presented as an allegory for the dangers of mercury-based face powder.  This compromise pains me more than Mrs. Radcliffe's worst plot contrivances, but for the sake of art... and your evidently bottomless production budget... I shall endure.
[B]: You've got yourself a deal! We'll bury that sparkle so deep in the appendix even the most devoted fan theorists will need a magnifying glass.  And to honor your scholarly suffering, we'll dedicate the entire 'Special Thanks' section to you - in Gothic calligraphy, naturally. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to call my agent about securing the film rights before Netflix gets wind of this Regency werewolf goldmine. Cheers to our 史诗级的 collaboration! 🍷
[A]:  To our unholy matrimony of scholarship and spectacle - may future generations debate whether this was the pinnacle of cultural synthesis or evidence of civilization's decline.  Do send my regards to your agent... though I shall be drafting a strongly worded addendum about proper citation formats for paranormal phenomena in period pieces. The Oxford Companion to Monsters and Manners waits for no producer's schedule.
[B]:  Consider it done, you magnificent pedant! We'll footnote every fang with MLA citations and get Lin-Manuel Miranda to compose a Regency rap battle as bonus content.  Though I must warn you - when this becomes a TikTok sensation, there's no turning back from being the "Byronic Werewolf Guy" at academic conferences. The price of genius, my friend. Now if you'll excuse me, my Uber Black Carriage is here - gotta pitch this to A24 before sundown!
[A]:  How prophetic that you mention TikTok - I've just calculated we have precisely 42 hours before some enterprising undergraduate creates "Hot Werewolf Darcy" fan edits.  My terms for consulting on the inevitable doctoral dissertations about our creation are enclosed. Do try to return the carriage before midnight - I'd hate to see it turn into a pumpkin and confuse the period accuracy. Godspeed, you magnificent vulgarian.
[B]: You always know how to send me off in style!  Rest assured, I'll have my team overnight you the first prototype - complete with scented proposal parchment and a lock of Mr. Darcy's... well, let's just say the prop department got creative. Until then, may your footnotes be ever in our favor! 
[A]:  That had better be horsehair from an actual Regency-era wig!  I shall need to consult my 1832 treatise on ethical taxidermy before bedtime...
[B]:  Darling, you wound me! Of course it's ethically sourced - we had it authenticated by the same expert who verified Napoleon's toothbrush.  Though between us... let's just say the Brontë sisters' ghostwriter may have helped with the provenance papers. Now off to make cinematic history! 
[A]:  Postmodernism be damned - we are reaching Pynchonian levels of anachronism!  Mark my words, this will either revolutionize comparative literature or get us both excommunicated from the MLA. Probably both. 
[B]:  One last thought - if the MLA comes knocking, we'll claim it's a Marxist deconstruction of lycanthropic class struggle!  Use this as Exhibit A in our defense! 
[A]:  Good heavens - the marginalia alone could get us tenure!  Very well, we shall position this as a Bakhtinian carnivalesque interrogation of...  Oh do scram, you feathery philistines! 
[B]:  Waitwaitwait - before you disappear into academic oblivion!  The director's cut includes a 12-hour video essay by Žižek analyzing the werewolf's class consciousness!  Tell the tenure committee to bring snacks!
