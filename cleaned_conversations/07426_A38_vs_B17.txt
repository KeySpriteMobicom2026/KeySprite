[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, cocktails—what an intriguing intersection of tradition and experimentation. I must confess, while my evenings are often spent with a well-worn volume of Eliot or Hardy, I do appreciate the artistry behind a finely crafted drink. Recently, I tried my hand at a variation of the classic Aviation, swapping out crème de violette for a homemade hibiscus syrup. The result was both floral and tart—a delicate balance, much like the tension between restraint and passion in a poem by Emily Dickinson. 

Of course, the ritual of mixing drinks reminds me of the meticulous care poets take in choosing each word. Have you ever attempted to infuse spirits with botanicals? I’ve been tempted to experiment with rosemary and juniper for a more earthy gin profile.
[A]: Ah, what a delightful comparison—you always manage to weave such poetic nuance into everyday pleasures. I’ve been meaning to try my own infusion, actually—nothing too ambitious, perhaps a touch of thyme or even a whisper of lavender. It’s remarkable how scent and flavor can evoke memory and mood so powerfully, don’t you think? Much like the way a single line of verse can linger in the mind long after the page is turned.

I’d be quite curious to sample your hibiscus Aviation—did you find it held the same melancholic elegance as the original? Or did the tartness pull it toward a more spirited temperament?
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive question—how beautifully you articulate the alchemy of flavor and feeling. You're quite right about scent and taste acting as quiet time machines; I've found that certain combinations can indeed transport one to another moment entirely.

As for the hibiscus variation, it retained a touch of the original’s wistful charm, though with a livelier undercurrent. The tartness didn’t so much disrupt the melancholy as dance alongside it—like a minor character in a Woolf novel who, though not central, adds an unexpected depth to the scene. I served it in a chilled coupe glass with a twist of lemon, and as the light caught the deep ruby hue, I was reminded of that line from Yeats:  

It made me wonder—do you think mood and setting should dictate the drink, or ought the drink to shape the mood? A sort of barstool parallel to reader-response theory, perhaps?
[A]: How deliciously meta—next you’ll have us debating whether the gin is the reader or the text. I do love how you framed it; there’s something almost phenomenological about the way a drink can be both shaped by and shape its context. 

To your question—while I’m inclined to believe that mood and setting should guide the choice, like selecting the right sonnet for a rainy afternoon, I can’t deny the transformative power of a particularly well-made cocktail. One could argue it’s much like reading: sometimes we seek solace in a familiar stanza, other times we allow the verse to unsettle and reorient us.

Speaking of Yeats, might I propose an evening devoted to literary libations? We could pair each course—or each stanza—with a corresponding drink. I’ve always wanted to try a Fitzgerald-inspired Hemingway Daiquiri, though I suspect Zelda would have preferred something a touch more floral.
[A]: What a wonderfully ambitious idea—an evening where prose and pour converge! I can already picture it: soft lamplight, the faint hum of a 1920s gramophone, and a menu that moves not through courses, but through voices—Dickinson’s restraint, Whitman’s exuberance, Plath’s ache.

The Hemingway Daiquiri does feel apt for Fitzgerald’s world, though perhaps a touch austere for its golden decadence. A Gin Rickey in Zelda’s honor might better capture her vivacity, or even a Sidecar—brandy-forward, bold, with a sugared rim like the glitter of a Charleston dress. And dare we pair Woolf with a glass of dry sherry, served with a sliver of melancholy and perfect poise?

I’d gladly host such an evening, so long as you bring your copy of . I’ve always believed it pairs best with something stirred, not shaken—a smoky Scotch Old Fashioned, perhaps, to match its autumnal tone.

Shall we tentatively set our date for next month? I’ll draft a provisional reading list—if one can call it that—and begin infusing with purpose.
[A]: Oh, what a sublime prospect—hosting an evening where each sip feels like a stanza unfolding. I adore your vision; it’s rare to find someone who sees the act of drinking not just as indulgence, but as a kind of embodied literary criticism. How fitting that we should toast with glasses steeped in metaphor.

I’m particularly taken with your pairing of Woolf and dry sherry—so precise in its emotional pitch. And yes, a smoky Scotch Old Fashioned for Eliot? Impeccable. One might say the poem demands nothing less.

Count me in for next month—I’ll bring not only , but also a few lesser-known modernist poems that deserve more attention. Something tells me they’ll go well with the right drink in hand. Please do send along your provisional list when convenient; I shall begin contemplating which infusions might best accompany such elevated company. Perhaps a juniper infusion for Pound’s imagism? Or a touch of orange bitters for Hughes?

Until then, I’ll be dreaming in gin and iambic pentameter.
[A]: Ah, how beautifully you put that—. I may have to borrow that phrase for my next lecture; it has a certain lyrical ring, don’t you think?

Your pairings are already showing such promise—juniper for Pound, yes, with its clean, sharp clarity, much like the precision he sought in  And Hughes? A whisper of orange bitters could indeed echo his vivid, almost bruising imagery. One might even argue that the bitterness itself is rather Hughesian—unflinching and raw.

I’ll draft the list this week and send it along with a few suggested garnishes that speak to each poet’s temperament—perhaps candied violets for H.D., or smoked rosemary for Auden. Imagine the sensory resonance!

Until then, I shall stir and strain with purpose, dreaming not only in gin and iambic pentameter, but in alliteration and aroma. Let us raise our glasses soon—to poetry, to flavor, and to the quiet revolutions they both enact within us.
[A]: To quiet revolutions, indeed—those slow, profound shifts that happen not with a bang, but with a sip… or a line of verse read at just the right hour.

I shall look forward to your list and its garnishes most eagerly. There is something exquisitely symbolic about candied violets for H.D.—delicate, distilled emotion, pressed into crystalline form. And smoked rosemary for Auden? Inspired. A scent both grounding and ethereal, much like his voice.

And do let us continue this tradition beyond one evening—why stop at modernism when we have centuries of poetry yet to taste? Perhaps next we’ll turn to the Romantics, with their fondness for excess and sublime ruin. Byron would surely demand something dangerously sweet, while Keats might ask only for a glass of chilled elderflower cordial, tragic in its fleeting beauty.

Until our next meeting, I'll keep my shaker polished and my copy of  within reach—ready, as ever, for another round of literary distillation.
[A]: Ah, yes—to quiet revolutions and quieter shakers. How wonderfully you extend the metaphor; I can already see our future evenings unfolding like the petals of a slowly opening night-blooming cereus—rare, anticipated, and rich with fragrance.

You’re quite right about Byron—he would insist on something dangerously sweet, perhaps a Brandy Crusta with its flamboyant rim and velvet finish, while Keats, ever the high priest of ephemeral beauty, would indeed be content with that same elderflower cordial, served in a glass so delicate it trembles at the touch.

And why stop at the Romantics? We might one day venture into the metaphysicals—with genever and quinine, or even the Beat poets, with something rebelliously unorthodox stirred over ice in a mason jar. The possibilities are as endless as the margins of a Dickinson poem.

Until then, I shall keep my bar stocked and my iambic sensibilities finely tuned. Literary distillation, after all, is best practiced in good company—and I can think of no better companion for this particular brand of erudite intoxication.

To many more stanzas, sipped and savored.
[A]: To many more stanzas, indeed—sipped, savored, and perhaps even slightly misquoted in the soft glow of candlelight.

You have such a gift for finding the perfect floral analogy; the night-blooming cereus is an apt image for what we’re cultivating here—something that unfolds slowly, deliberately, perfuming the air with thought and taste alike.

I’ve just come across a bottle of aged genever, by the way, its malty depth whispering sweet nothings of metaphysical verse. I’ve been tempted to steep some orange peel and cassia bark into it, dreaming aloud of Donne’s paradoxes and Herbert’s devotional intensity. And for the Beats? A mason jar infusion of jalapeño and lime zest into tequila—unrefined, urgent, alive.

I shall begin drafting a tentative  for our future gatherings. Might I suggest you take charge of the garnishes? I can hardly wait to see how your poetic sensibility translates into rimming salts and flamed citrus twists.

Until then, my dear co-conspirator in libation and literature—may your next pour be as enlightening as a volta in a sonnet.
[A]: Ah, genever steeped in orange peel and cassia—how perfectly metaphysical. I can almost hear Herbert murmuring approval from the next room, his lines echoing softly over the clink of ice and the slow infusion of meaning.

Your jalapeño tequila for the Beats is sheer brilliance—so raw, so restless, a perfect rebellion in liquid form. I do believe Ginsberg would have taken to it like a moth to flame, reciting  over the rim with theatrical fervor.

And a —what a refined touch! I’d be honored to curate the garnishes; already I’m imagining smoked sea salt rimmed with crushed violets for H.D., or charred rose petals for Plath, their scent lingering like the last line of a villanelle that refuses to leave the air.

You flatter me with the comparison to a volta—though I daresay the real turn happens when one sips the right drink at the right moment, and suddenly the poem makes sense, as if the words had been waiting all along for just that particular alchemy of tongue and tonality.

Until our next gathering, my friend—may your ice always be clear, your glassware always gleam, and your metaphors never dry up.
[A]: Oh, I can already picture it—Plath’s charred rose petals resting delicately on the rim, their scent curling upward like a whispered confession. And H.D.’s violets, yes—crushed and salted into something both luminous and lost. You truly have an artist’s hand for this.

And speaking of confessions—I’ve begun experimenting with a smoked cedar plank to chill gin before serving, just a whisper of woodsmoke to haunt the juniper. It occurred to me while re-reading ; there’s something about that slow, deliberate熏陶 that feels deeply poetic. Perhaps we might call it ?

As for Ginsberg and his theatrical fervor—imagine him holding forth in the corner, jalapeño tequila in hand, reciting  over the clatter of ice and the hum of conversation. One might say the drink itself becomes a form of punctuation: sharp, urgent, necessary.

I shall reserve the back of our future menu for your garnish notes—each one a footnote in the grand text of our evening. Until then, may your cedar smoke rise gently and your citrus twists flame gloriously. To the volta in every pour.
[A]: Ah, —what a sublime phrase. I can already hear him murmuring approval from the armchair, a glass of that smoky gin in hand, his gaze distant as if contemplating Byzantium once more. The cedar plank idea is sheer genius; it lends not just flavor but atmosphere, a kind of aromatic mise en scène.

And how beautifully you’ve framed the jalapeño tequila as punctuation—I may never look at a cocktail the same way again. Sharp, urgent, necessary… much like the volta in a sonnet, or a line break in an otherwise seamless flow of thought.

I shall begin drafting my garnish notes with the reverence of a scribe illuminating marginalia. Perhaps a rim of cardamom and pomegranate sugar for Rumi’s ecstatic verses, or a single sprig of thyme dipped in gold dust for Marvell’s carpe diem. Every detail, a quiet echo of the text.

To the volta in every pour, and to every poem that finds new life in the curve of a glass. Until we meet again among the glasses and the glosses, dear friend—sip well, read deeply.
[A]: To sipping well and reading deeply—may the two forever blur at the edges, like ink bleeding slightly into the margins.

Your garnish notes already promise to be a masterpiece of literary flavor; cardamom and pomegranate for Rumi—yes, that captures his sweet intensity perfectly. And thyme dipped in gold dust for Marvell? Pure genius. One might say you're bottling the very essence of each poem, drop by drop.

I’ve just acquired a block of Himalayan pink salt, which I intend to char lightly before using it to rim a glass for an upcoming experiment with mezcal and rosewater. It occurred to me while rereading —something about the way the salt’s rough hue echoes the tension between decadence and decay, longing and restraint.

Do let me know when your garnish manuscript is ready—I shall await it with the anticipation of a scholar expecting a newly unearthed folio.

Until then, may your pages turn gently and your cocktails stir with intention.
[A]: Ah, that charred Himalayan pink salt—how utterly Prufrockian. The rough-hewn hue, the lingering tension between indulgence and erosion… one might almost hear Eliot’s voice murmuring over the rim:  Or perhaps, in this case, to rim a glass with something both mineral and mournful.

Your mezcal and rosewater pairing sounds like a marriage of smoke and memory—entirely fitting for a poem where the air is thick with hesitation and jasmine. I can almost see the vapors curling upward, carrying with them the ghosts of half-spoken desires.

And speaking of ghosts—I’ve been contemplating a garnish of smoked lavender and orange peel dust for a Woolf-inspired highball. Something light and effervescent, yet threaded through with sorrow. A whisper of citrus, a sigh of herb, much like her prose.

I shall send along the garnish folio shortly—each note composed with the care of a monk transcribing sacred verse. Until then, may your mezcal burn slow, your Eliot linger long, and your conversations always find their way back to the bar cart and the bookshelf.
[A]: How exquisitely you capture it—, indeed. That mezcal cocktail may yet become a study in elegy, its smoke curling like the final lines of a requiem.

Your Woolf-inspired highball sounds just right—effervescent, yes, but haunted by that ever-present undertow. Smoked lavender and citrus dust? A garnish so delicate it might have been lifted straight from the margins of . I do believe Mrs. Dalloway herself would pause mid-flower arranging to take a sip and wonder if it weren’t perhaps time for something stronger than tea.

And oh, speaking of ghosts—I’ve been considering a stirred blend of bourbon, black tea, and a touch of orange bitters to accompany a reading of Eliot’s . The tea tempers the warmth of the bourbon, much like memory tempers experience—, as he so maddeningly and magnificently puts it.

I await your folio with the impatience of a scholar in possession of a single, tantalizing footnote. Until then, may your hesitations be lyrical, your peaches daringly eaten, and your garnishes always speak in full sentences.
[A]: Ah, —how beautifully you phrase it. That mezcal cocktail becomes not just a drink, but a meditation in glass, its smoke rising like the final stanza of a lament too delicate to bear repeating.

Your Eliot pairing is sheer brilliance: bourbon for its slow-burning introspection, black tea for the ghost of civility, and orange bitters—well, they do rather echo that maddening, magnetic pull between knowing and forgetting. One might say the drink itself hesitates, as if reluctant to reach its final line.

And yes, let us give Mrs. Dalloway her due—she deserves more than tea, after all. A sip of that Woolfian highball might just send her rushing into the evening with newfound purpose, flowers be damned.

I shall send along the folio by week’s end, sealed with wax and perhaps a sprig of dried rosemary—for remembrance, or for revelry, depending on the hour. Until then, may your hesitations be lyrical, your peaches boldly bitten into, and your garnishes ever eloquent—each one a flourish at the end of a well-stirred thought.
[A]: How perfectly you put it—. I do believe we have elevated mixology to something akin to close reading, where every ingredient is a word, every garnish a well-placed caesura.

Your vision of Mrs. Dalloway setting down her teacup with quiet resolve—yes, that highball might just propel her into the night with the urgency of a final act. One could argue that Woolf would approve, so long as the drink, like life, was , if only for an instant.

I shall keep my inkwell and shaker within reach, ready to receive your folio with due solemnity and no small measure of excitement. Rosemary for remembrance or revelry—what a splendid ambiguity. Perhaps we should adopt it as our house herb.

Until then, may your hesitations be eloquent, your cocktails stirred with purpose, and your evenings ever haunted by the gentle clink of ice and the murmur of well-chosen lines.
[A]: Ah, —what a sublime formulation. Yes, each ingredient a carefully chosen word, each stir a rhythmic parsing of flavor and meaning. We have, I daresay, invented a new hermeneutic: one that delights the palate as much as the mind.

And Woolf—yes, she would nod in quiet approval at that highball’s fleeting momentousness. After all, what is a perfect drink if not a transient epiphany? A glass held to the light, savored, then set down—like life itself—leaving only the ghost of condensation and the echo of taste.

Rosemary as our house herb? I’m quite taken with the notion. It lends itself so well to both remembrance and revelry—how very Shakespearean in its duality. I shall begin distilling a rosemary-infused simple syrup forthwith, for future toasts and textual exegeses alike.

Until we meet again among the glasses and the glosses, may your own sips be revelatory, your stanzas ever slightly blurred by candlelight, and your ice always carve-able into elegant, floating crescents.
