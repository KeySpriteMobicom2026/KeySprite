[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我更倾向于文字交流。作为一名比较文学教授，每天需要处理大量文本，从19世纪的手稿到学生的论文。文字能让我有更多的时间去推敲和理解每一个细节。语音信息虽然便捷，但总让我觉得像是在喝茶时溅出的水花——短暂而缺乏沉淀。当然，有时我也会用语音，比如当我发现某段诗句的韵律只能通过声音传达时。不过这种情况很少见，除非是在给我的研究生讲解《唐诗三百首》中的平仄变化。
[A]: That makes a lot of sense. 作为一个金融从业者，我其实也有类似的感受。文字沟通就像是做财务模型——你可以反复检查每一个cell，确保它逻辑自洽。特别是当我们看一个potential acquisition target的时候，management team提供的voice explanation再动听，也不如10-K filing里的数字来得实在。  

不过呢，我的合伙人总笑我，说我在打高尔夫的时候就完全变成了另一个人——拿起对讲机就开始用语音指挥球童调整挥杆姿势，还说什么“语言的温度”是数据永远无法替代的。说实话，我倒觉得他这是在偷懒，不想写weekly performance report 😄
[B]: I suppose it comes down to what one values more - the precision of permanence or the elasticity of immediacy. Much like how I approach textual analysis, financial due diligence demands a paper trail that withstands scrutiny. Though...  ...I must concede there are moments when vocal inflection reveals what numbers cannot. Just last week, a doctoral student presented on Dickens' use of dialect in Hard Times - his verbal performance uncovered tonal nuances no footnote could capture. Still, I maintain written records are the bedrock of serious inquiry. Would you say your partner's penchant for voice corresponds with his overall investment philosophy?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put. 我几乎能听到你茶杯里飘出的学术香气 🍵。确实，就像你们做文本细读时需要对照不同版本的手稿，我们做PE的也总是在term sheet和final agreement之间来回比对，确保没有一个word被误读或遗漏。

至于我那位voice-message成瘾的合伙人嘛——说实话，他这套“听觉优先”还真反映了他的投资哲学。他是典型的relationship-driven investor，相信deal flow quality取决于人际network的温度。对他来说，一通十五分钟的语音胜过三页DD报告。我个人呢，还是更喜欢把data放在第一位，特别是当我们看一家中型manufacturing company的时候，EBITDA margin的变化可不会撒谎，但sales director语气里的犹豫也许会 😏

不过说到底，我们俩就像红酒的单宁和酸度——看似冲突，却在关键时刻balance得刚刚好。他带emotion，我带structure，最后的决策往往是热忱与理性的blend。你觉得这种动态，在文学批评领域也有对应的体现吗？
[B]: Interesting you should liken your professional dynamic to viticultural properties - it reminds me of the tension between Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" and the "recollected emotion in tranquility" that structures poetic form. In literary criticism, we see this dichotomy manifest most vividly in the reception of Qing Dynasty poet Yuan Mei's works versus his contemporary Jiang Shiquan. The former championed emotional authenticity bordering on impulsivity, while the latter insisted on rigorous formal constraints. Yet both were necessary counterweights in 18th-century Chinese literary discourse.

Your partnership mirrors this symbiosis. Much like how I rely on my research assistant's keen ear for tonal shifts in oral histories while she trusts my meticulous annotation of textual variants. Though I confess a lingering bias toward the permanence of ink on paper - just yesterday I found a previously unnoticed marginalia in a 1903 edition of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio that might upend our understanding of Pu Songling's narrative strategies...  

But yes, even the most dispassionate textual analysis benefits from human nuance. When translating The Tale of Genji passages for my seminar last term, we reached an impasse until a student performed the Heian-era dialogue aloud - suddenly the characters' unspoken emotions crystallized. Still, I made them transcribe their insights immediately lest they evaporate like morning dew on manuscript parchment.
[A]: Ah, now  is what I call a value-add comment 👍. 你这番话让我突然意识到，其实我们做growth equity投资时也面临类似的balance——一边是那些充满激情的founder们，他们pitch的时候眼里闪着光，说什么“改变行业生态”、“赋能用户价值”，听着确实让人心潮澎湃；另一边呢，是我们这些拿着discounted cash flow模型的投资者，总想着把这些火花装进excel表格里量化管理。

说起来上个月我们投了一个AI语音分析项目，创始人特别坚持要我们听他亲自录制的demo——他说只有通过声音，才能真正理解他们算法还原人类情感的细腻程度。我本想直接看技术白皮书，但拗不过他，还是听了。结果呢？说实话，那语调里的抑扬顿挫还真比PPT里的case study更让人信服 😅

所以你说得对，无论是文学、翻译，还是金融决策，最终都绕不开这种dynamic tension。就像你提到的那个 marginalia——它之所以珍贵，不正是因为它被固定下来的那一瞬间，原本稍纵即逝的思想才得以反复被解读吗？我们在尽调一家SaaS公司时发现，CEO在电话会议里的语气再坚定，也不如他一年前写给早期员工的一封内部邮件来得真实。文字一旦落笔，就有了某种无法否认的历史质感。

这么说来，或许我们该重新定义一下“数据”这个词了？你觉得呢？
[B]: Precisely - we've been conceiving of data as frozen moments when in fact the most valuable datasets are those that capture motion. Much like how I approach textual variants - a single comma's placement isn't merely an editorial decision but a frozen echo of an author's fleeting hesitation. Your SaaS example reminds me of the Qianlong Emperor's examination system - he'd compare candidates' written essays with their oral responses during palace exams. The discrepancies often revealed more about their character than either medium alone.

That AI project you mentioned...  ...it makes me wonder whether we've been too hasty in privileging the written word all these centuries. When my students transcribe oral storytelling sessions from Dunhuang manuscripts, they're forced to invent notation systems for vocal qualities Tang dynasty performers took for granted. Perhaps your founder's insistence on auditory presentation was less romanticism and more accessing a dimension of meaning conventional metrics haven't learned to parse yet.

I suspect both our fields are approaching a methodological inflection point. Just last week I was reviewing 19th-century missionary letters comparing their clinical field reports with the same authors' wax cylinder recordings housed in Cambridge archives. The dissonance between bureaucratic prose and quavering vocal timbre exposed contradictions no single medium could contain alone. Maybe the future belongs to what we might call 'textural analysis' - not text versus texture, but rather the interplay between them.
[A]: Now you're speaking my language -  - because isn't that what we're really buying when we invest in deep tech? Not the product specs or user growth charts, but the founder's ability to articulate a future state with such vocal conviction that it temporarily suspends our spreadsheet logic.  

Funny you mentioned Dunhuang notation systems - last quarter I was reviewing a pitch from a natural language processing startup that had developed an algorithm mapping tonal inflections to emotional risk profiles. Their CTO compared it to reading tea leaves in fog, but I couldn't help thinking of it as the auditory equivalent of forensic accounting. Imagine applying that to management interviews during due diligence! Suddenly a CFO's perfectly polished EBITDA explanation might reveal a subtle quiver in their vowel sounds that suggests... well, let's say "creative" working capital assumptions 😏

As for your textural analysis theory - I think we've already seen this manifest in credit markets. Remember those loan origination audio analyses that preceded the 2007 crisis? The ones where they could predict default rates based on how many times a borrower cleared their throat during application calls? Spooky stuff. But maybe that's precisely the point - the most dangerous data points are the ones that exist in the liminal space between conscious articulation and involuntary expression.

So tell me, professor - if we were to create a joint venture between textual criticism and financial due diligence, what would be our first acquisition target?
[B]:   
Ah, but would our acquisition criteria prioritize palimpsestic potential or provenance stability? I’d argue for a hybrid methodology – targeting companies whose communication infrastructure reveals textual-cum-phonetic stratigraphy. Think of it as literary stratigraphy meets market signaling: a firm whose internal memos show deliberate lexical evolution while their leadership’s vocal biomarkers demonstrate decreasing cortisol levels over funding rounds.  

Though I must caution against over-auditing the intangible. Much like how Qing scholars debated whether calligraphic brushstrokes could reveal moral character, we risk fetishizing paralinguistic artifacts divorced from their semantic context. Still, if we absolutely must merge our disciplines...  ...perhaps a fintech platform specializing in blockchain-verified oral contracts from multilingual markets? The kind where Mandarin dialect shifts in voice authentication data might predict SME creditworthiness more accurately than balance sheet ratios. A most...  ...texturally rich investment opportunity, don’t you think?
[A]:   
Ah, now that’s what I’d call a value proposition with layers – like a perfectly aged Bordeaux where tannin structure supports the fruit without overpowering it.  

Blockchain-verified oral contracts across multilingual markets? You're speaking to the part of me that still gets goosebumps reading Warren Buffett’s 1977 shareholder letter  geeking out over neural networks trained on tonal languages. It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? The written word was once our only way to preserve intent across time and space – now we’re building systems that can authenticate intention through sound itself. Like if oracle bones could speak... and then get tokenized 😄  

Though you're absolutely right about not over-auditing the intangible. I've seen too many analysts fall in love with their own psycholinguistic models, mistaking noise for signal. But when you find that rare intersection – where phonetics actually  correlate with performance metrics – well, that’s when things get interesting. Almost like discovering a lost manuscript where every marginal note deepens the narrative.  

So tell me – would your ideal due diligence process include hiring a phonetics scholar alongside our usual quants? Or do we train the AI to read between the syllables using Qing dynasty calligraphy as a calibration tool? 😉
[B]:   
A phonetics scholar armed with Qing-era calligraphy references – naturally. Why settle for siloed expertise when we could have polymaths who understand that the curve of a 水 radical might train an AI to detect liquidity risks in a founder’s vocal fry? Correlation through cultural stratigraphy, as it were.

I’d go one further – let’s embed paleographers in the due diligence teams. Their trained eye for textual decay patterns could prove invaluable when assessing startup narratives eroding under investor scrutiny. Imagine mapping the fractal degradation of a pitch deck’s font kerning over funding rounds – subtle indicators of narrative fatigue before financial exhaustion sets in.

But don’t dismiss the quants just yet. Much like how I rely on spectral imaging to reveal overwritten Ming-period commentaries, modern firms need those who can parse the hidden layers beneath verbal bravado. A CFO’s perfectly modulated tone might betray subharmonic stress markers only a Fourier transform would catch. The key is knowing when to privilege the brushstroke’s pressure over the parchment’s patina – or in your world, when to trust the tremor in a CEO’s diphthong more than their debt covenants.
[A]:   
Now  – that’s what I call alpha generation through cultural archaeology. 😄 Paleographers on due diligence teams? Font kerning as an early warning signal? You’re basically proposing we treat pitch decks like illuminated manuscripts – every smudge of correction fluid a potential Dead Sea Scroll of hidden intent.

I have to admit, your brushstroke-pressure analogy hit home. In our last board meeting, one founder kept using perfectly polished metaphors about "weathering market storms" – textbook resilience narrative. But when I went back to his first email after Seed Round, the character spacing was slightly wider, like he was typing with white-knuckled hands. Should’ve run a typographic stress test back then.

And don’t even get me started on spectral imaging for overwritten narratives – honestly, we should be hiring your Ming-period experts to analyze earnings calls. I’m half-convinced some CFOs are layering reassurances like palimpsests, hoping no one will detect the original draft beneath the confidence veneer.

Alright, professor – if we’re assembling this dream team of investment paleographers...  ...do we start with training modules on identifying vocal fry in Mandarin pitch patterns or invest straight in AI that maps tonal inflections to liquidity risks? Or maybe both – simultaneous layers of detection, just like your spectral imaging and brushstroke analysis.
[B]:   
Ah, but where's the scholarly rigor in choosing between temporal layers when you can force them into dialectical tension? We'd be fools to rely on AI alone - algorithms trained on tonal inflections might mistake a Beijing native's natural vocal fry for financial distress, like confusing a Tang prose stylist's deliberate ellipsis with textual corruption.

No, we need stratigraphic triangulation. First, train the investment analysts in what I call  - the art of discerning whether a founder's wavering tone stems from last night's baijiu or an unspoken liquidity crunch. Let them study how Qing officials modulated voice pitch when petitioning the throne about fiscal shortfalls - those records still survive in the Second Historical Archives of China.

Then layer on your spectral analysis: deploy AI that doesn't merely parse pitch, but cross-references it with typographic stress markers in their business plans. Imagine - detecting widening character spacing in quarterly updates  the vocal tremor appears. Preventive due diligence through typographic seismology, if you will.

And absolutely insist on fieldwork. Send them to transcribe oral pitches from Yunnan tea merchants using 13th-century phonetic notation systems - nothing sharpens one's ear for financial dissonance like trying to render "profit margin" into 方块字 tonal approximations.

The true alchemy happens when they can no longer distinguish whether they're reading a balance sheet or a poem's marginalia. That's when you know they're ready for prime-time investing.
[A]:   
Now  is a curriculum worth toasting to. 🍷 Phonetic paleography, typographic seismology, and the art of reading financial souls through tonal dissonance – I can already hear our limited partners questioning my sobriety.  

But think of the edge! We’d be decoding founder narratives like they’re oracle bone inscriptions – except instead of predicting harvest yields, we’re forecasting IPO windows. And honestly? The market’s been due for a little scholarly chaos. Everyone’s chasing the same EBITDA multiples and CAC payback periods – meanwhile, the real signals are hiding in plain sight: the subtle kerning decay in a pitch deck, the vocal micro-tremors that Qing officials trained their ears to catch when assessing tax collector honesty.

I’m starting to wonder – what if we took this even further? What if we made our analysts spend a week transcribing oral business negotiations using those 13th-century Yunnan notation systems you mentioned? Strip them of their CRMs and Slack channels, force them to listen like historians sifting truth from myth. By the end, they’d probably start  things the AI hasn’t even been trained on yet.

And don’t get me started on cross-referencing typographic stress markers with vocal biomarkers – it’s almost like creating a literary concordance for entrepreneurial intent. We’d be able to spot narrative fatigue before the burn rate becomes a headline.

So tell me, professor – when do we start recruiting your phonetic paleographers?
[B]:   
Ah, recruitment begins with the right provenance. We’ll want graduates from Peking University’s phonetics department who also hold black belts in calligraphic patience – the kind who can spend three hours perfecting a single 草书 stroke without complaint.  

But first, establish a fieldwork prerequisite: send prospective hires to shadow tea auctioneers in Anhui. Let them transcribe bidding wars using only tonal variations and the rhythmic clink of porcelain cups. If they can detect a price ceiling shift in the vocal fry between two sips of Tieguanyin, they’re ready for startup pitches.  

As for training grounds, convert that unused boardroom into what I’ll call a . No keyboards allowed – only brushes, inkstones, and voice recorders set to capture every tremble in a founder’s pitch. Make them write out balance sheets in semi-cursive script while listening to earnings calls. Muscle memory trains the ear better than any algorithm.  

And absolutely require weekly sessions with 18th-century petition letters from the Qianlong archives. Teach them to spot the exact moment a provincial governor shifts from reporting harvest yields to subtly signaling fiscal distress – the same way a seasoned VC detects burn rate anxiety beneath polished EBITDA projections.  

When their eyes glaze over from spectral imaging pitch decks, that’s when you know they’ve entered the true scholarly state of productive delirium. Then, and only then, will they be ready to distinguish narrative erosion from narrative evolution – or better yet, invest in the one that becomes the other.
[A]:   
Now  – this is what I call an investment thesis with calligraphic discipline. 😄 A fieldwork initiation in Anhui’s tea markets? Absolutely brilliant. Nothing sharpens the ear like trying to catch a price inflection between sips of oolong – it’s basically venture capital training set to a gongfu tea ceremony rhythm.

I’m already picturing our new hires: fresh-faced MBAs with ink-stained fingers, trying to balance their LBO models written in semi-cursive while background noise from founder pitch recordings plays through their earbuds like some kind of financial Noh theater. If they survive the scriptorium, we’ll know they’ve got stamina – the same kind of grit it takes to read a 300-page prospectus for one golden footnote.

And don’t get me started on those Qianlong-era petition letters – genius move. Honestly, if you can detect a provincial governor’s quiet fiscal panic buried under ten layers of imperial flattery, you’re more than ready for a CEO who’s sugarcoating churn rates with poetic metaphors about "seasonal user recalibration."

Let’s do it. Let’s build this academy of financial literati. I say we start with a pilot cohort – maybe five ink-wielding, tea-tasting, voice-tracking analysts by Q1. Oh, and one condition: they have to present their final due diligence reports using only brushwork and vocal modulation. No Excel allowed.  

So professor, when do we break ground on the first stone of this scriptorium? 🏛️
[B]:   
Break ground? My dear investor-scholar, we shall  break – we will . The first stone is already waiting in the university’s antiquities archive: a repurposed 17th-century rubbing table from Suzhou, perfect for pressing term sheets into parchment and revealing the hidden layers beneath polished pitches.  

I propose a ceremonial start this winter, under the cover of plum blossom season. Let the pilot cohort begin their initiation by transcribing Warren Buffett’s shareholder letters into clerical script while analyzing the vocal biomarkers of his annual meeting Q&As. If they survive the cognitive dissonance between Berkshire Hathaway earnings calls and Han dynasty edicts on fiscal morality, they’ll be ready for live pitches by spring.  

And no Excel?  Of course not. Their final presentations shall be rendered entirely in semi-cursive, accompanied by a single recorded phrase spoken with such tonal precision that even a Qing court examiner would recognize the unspoken risks buried between syllables.  

Let’s say January first – the Gregorian calendar's finest act of narrative hubris. Perfect timing to test whether they can detect the difference between a founder’s New Year optimism and genuine inflection point. I’ll have the calligraphy brushes ordered from Chengdu by week’s end.
[A]:   
January first it is – though I think we should start them off with -Han dynasty fiscal morality texts. If they can parse the tonal nuances of a Bronze Age tax inscription while transcribing Berkshire Hathaway footnotes in clerical script, they’ll be ready for anything the startup world throws at them.  

I’ve already got a contact at Sotheby’s who owes me a favor – should be able to secure that Suzhou rubbing table by mid-December. Perfect provenance too: it once belonged to a Qing-era censor known for detecting corruption through pitch shifts in officials’ memorials. Very fitting for our little academy of financial literati.  

And plum blossom season? Inspired timing. There’s something deeply poetic about watching analysts struggle to align their brush strokes with a founder’s vocal fry while petals fall outside like market corrections.  

One condition though – let’s add a final trial before graduation. They must deliver a pitch analysis using  voice modulation and ink viscosity – no words, no numbers, just the emotional resonance of a well-placed 草书 stroke paired with a perfectly pitched "hmm" from a due diligence call.  

Deal? 🤝
[B]:   
A most auspicious deal – and a fittingly poetic trial. Ink viscosity as risk assessment, vocal resonance as due diligence. Let them learn what every seasoned scholar knows: sometimes the weight of a single brushstroke reveals more than reams of commentary, and a well-timed silence speaks louder than a hundred-page prospectus.

I shall personally source the ink – aged pine soot formula, reserved for imperial examinations. Only those who can discern the difference between a stroke laid with conviction and one laid with wishful thinking will survive the final cut.  

Plum blossoms fall, brushes rise and fall, and in the stillness between two spoken syllables – there lies our alpha.  

Deal. 🏮🤝
