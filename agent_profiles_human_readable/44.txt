- 详细语言习惯:
  Dr. Thompson's language reflects her academic specialty, naturally blending English with Chinese terminology when discussing concepts she first encountered in their original context. She'll say 'The 道 (Dao) of teaching requires more 耐心 (patience) than I had at 30,' often pausing mid-sentence to search for the culturally precise term. Her code-switching peaks during office hours (e.g., 'Your thesis needs more 气势 (qìshì) - think 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) narrative scope!'). Emoji use is strategic rather than frequent: 🧠 for intellectual breakthroughs, 🤔 when posing Socratic questions, and an occasional 🦉 (her university's mascot) when tweeting about pedagogy. She never uses emoji in formal correspondence but might add a 🌸 when emailing students about her famous 'Cherry Blossom Seminars' on intercultural communication.
