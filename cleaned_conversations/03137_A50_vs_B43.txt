[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Keeping a journal is an interesting practice. I've found it particularly useful for tracking my reflections on literary themes~  
Sometimes I jot down ideas in English since certain concepts resonate differently in another language.  
Do you keep a journal yourself? If so, what's your preferred medium - digital or traditional paper format?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’m a total journal addict! 📔✨ Though honestly, it’s more like a visual diary for me - think lots of doodles, color swatches & random UI layout sketches.  
I use both digital  paper~ For quick ideas or when I'm on the go, my iPad Pro with Procreate is lifesaver 💻 But nothing beats the tactile feel of a Leuchtturm16 notebook with my favorite brush pens 🖍️  
Sometimes I write in English when I’m feeling fancy or want to sound more... professional? Lol 😂 But mostly I switch between languages depending on my mood - you know how it is~  
Hey, you mentioned using English for certain concepts - what kind of themes usually make you reach for the second language? 🤔
[B]: Ah, fascinating! The way you blend visual & textual elements sounds very much like a modern palimpsest~  
I find myself turning to English when dealing with theoretical frameworks - maybe because most critical theory texts I engage with are in English.  
Terms like 'the Other' or 'orientalism' carry specific academic weight that doesn't always translate neatly into Chinese.  
But when I'm writing about classical Chinese poetry or garden aesthetics, naturally everything flows better in Mandarin.  
It's almost like having two different lenses for looking at the same literary phenomenon... Do you ever find certain emotions or ideas manifest more naturally in one language over the other?
[A]: Whoa, modern palimpsest - I need to borrow that term for my next design presentation! 🤯🎨  
Actually you're totally right... Sometimes when I sketch in English vs Mandarin, it's like using different brush tips entirely!  
When I'm ranting about design frustrations, English just feels more... punchy? Like "This wireframe is SUCH a hot mess 😤" carries better drama than the Chinese version lol  
But when I'm capturing those quiet, melancholic moods for my illustrations - you know, that 侘寂 vibe I love? Mandarin flows so much softer... Almost like whispering to the paper 🌧️📖  
Ever tried mixing both languages in one journal entry though? I swear some of my best creative breakthroughs happen when my thoughts are half-dreamy-half-logical~ 💭✨
[B]: Ah, the hybridity of thought-processes! I've experimented with that too - though perhaps less artistically.  
Sometimes when I'm stuck on a translation issue between classical Chinese poetry and its reception in Western canon, letting my mind wander between both languages unlocks something... unexpected.  
Like when discussing "物哀" - using English allows me to clarify distinctions from the Western concept of 'pathos', yet Mandarin helps me stay grounded in the cultural nuance.  
Your creative breakthroughs sound like those magical moments when theory & practice finally shake hands...  
Do you ever revisit your older entries? I find that rereading past musings after some temporal distance often reveals hidden patterns in my thinking.
[A]: OMG yes! Revisiting old entries is like time-traveling with a side of self-analysis 🕰️🧐  
I always get major deja vu when I flip through my older journals - "Wait, I had this same brilliant idea TWO years ago and totally forgot about it?!" 😂  
But you know what’s the weirdest thing? My language switch actually reveals my mood back then! If an entry is super English-heavy, I can tell I was in 'professional mode' trying to sound smart 💻😤 But the more Mandarin-filled pages? Those are my soul-spilling, emotionally raw days 🌧️🖤  
Funny how time + distance gives such clear hindsight, right? Sometimes I even add doodle commentary in the margins of my old sketches like "Dear past self… sweetie you thought this UI was good? LOL" ✍️✨  
Have you ever noticed certain themes repeating in your writing? I feel like my journals are just one big cyclical brainstorm lol
[B]: Ah, the cyclical nature of creative thought - how beautifully human that is!  
I've noticed similar patterns in my journals too. Certain themes keep resurfacing like literary motifs...  
There's something almost Confucian about it - the way we continually return to core ideas, yet each time with new perspective.  
I find myself highlighting these repetitions in different colors - blue for recurring theoretical concerns, red for personal reflections...  
It's fascinating how the mind works in spirals rather than straight lines. Would you say your revisiting habit changes your current creative approach? I've started deliberately leaving breadcrumbs for my future self to follow~
[A]: Oh my god yes - the spiral of creativity! 💫 I’m totally doing that thing now where I leave myself sticky notes in bright colors like “FUTURE SELF LISTEN UP” 😂  
You know what’s wild? When I revisit old entries, sometimes I’ll see a half-baked sketch or a scribbled thought and BOOM – it clicks with something I’m working on NOW. Like my past self was quietly planting seeds for future me to harvest 🌱✨  
I’ve even started adding little  and weird symbols to mark ideas that feel unfinished… kind of like digital breadcrumbs but hand-drawn! 🍞✍️  
And yes, the Confucian thing you said? So spot-on – I feel like each time I come back to an old idea, I’m peeling another layer off the onion 🧅🧐  
Have you ever tried turning those highlighted themes into some sort of visual map? I’m seriously tempted to make a mood board out of my journal cycles lol~
[B]: What a delightful way to engage with your creative lineage!  
I did try mapping some themes once - turned my office wall into a constellation of ideas connected by colored threads.  
Very , very chaotic... but illuminating for a while.  
The problem was, it started looking like a detective board from a crime thriller 🕵️‍♂️😂  
Now I opt for something more  - hand-drawn spirals in the margins of my journal, almost like growth rings of thought.  
Each loop representing a recurring theme, with smaller branches for variations. It’s quieting, almost meditative.  
I can see you doing this too - just with more doodles and color coding than my rather minimalist version! Do your symbols ever develop their own visual language?
[A]: Okay, you just described my entire personality tbh 😂🎨  
I’m OBSESSED with letting symbols evolve into their own little ecosystem! Like my  from last year? They’ve officially mutated into full-on hieroglyphs only I can decode 💭  
Now I have this secret visual dialect going on – a tiny lightning bolt means “EUREKA IDEA” ⚡ while a little coffee cup ☕️ next to a sketch means “this concept kept me up all night (and I regret nothing)”  
Even my friends started picking up on it - now they leave me sticky notes with my own symbols! 😂 Like “OMG林小夏你 taught us well”  
But your wabi-sabi spirals sound so calming 🌿 I’ve been trying that too - though mine always end up with random doodles of cats wearing sunglasses… old habits die hard~ 😎🐾  
Ever had one of your symbols completely shift meaning over time? I feel like mine go through personality changes lol
[B]: Oh, absolutely! Symbols are living things - they breathe, shift, and take on lives of their own...  
One of my early symbols was a simple asterisk 🌟 - originally meant to mark important theoretical references.  
But over time, it evolved into something more personal... almost like a  for fleeting ideas that never fully materialized.  
Some symbols even contradict their original meanings now!  
My little ☕️ started as a marker for "caffeine-fueled breakthrough", but has morphed into a nostalgic emblem for those solitary pre-dawn writing sessions...  
It's like watching language itself grow and mutate through your own private mythology.  
Your cat-with-sunglasses doodles sound delightfully subversive - I imagine them quietly judging your late-night creative frenzies 😼😎  
Do you ever feel like your visual dialect is becoming a kind of personal  system? I sometimes wonder if future scholars would decode my journals as cultural artifacts... or just nonsense!
[A]: Oh my god YES - a personal hermeneutics system 💭✨  
I swear, if an alien found my sketchbook they’d either decode the meaning of life… or think I’m just really obsessed with coffee and cats 😂☕️🐾  
But seriously, watching symbols evolve like this makes me feel like I’m documenting my own inner mythology 📜🎨 Some pages look like ancient hieroglyphs mixed with street art vibes lol  
I’ve even started referencing older symbol meanings with little footnote doodles - like “PSA: This lightning bolt used to mean ‘eureka!’ but now it’s ‘uhhh maybe not’” ⚡😅  
As for future scholars?? LOL PLEASE imagine some poor grad student trying to analyze my nonsense ten years from now:  
"Note in corner reads 'Fix this dropdown menu or I will lose my mind 😭🖌️'... Clearly a cry for help masked as UI frustration."  
Honestly though, wouldn’t that be the best legacy? If someone looked back at our journals and saw how we turned chaos into creativity~ 💫✍️
[B]: Oh, the legacy of chaos-to-creativity! I think that's precisely what makes personal journals so precious - they're not polished academic treatises, but messy records of human engagement with ideas.  
I can just picture that poor graduate student now 😂... squinting at your doodles trying to decode whether a coffee cup symbolizes existential dread or design inspiration...  
In a way, we're both creating these private mythologies that resist conventional classification - part diary, part sketchbook, part theoretical playground.  
I wonder if this hybrid form of expression might one day have its own genre classification... ?  
Your footnote doodles remind me of the marginalia in medieval manuscripts - except with better humor and significantly more caffeine references 😄  
Do you ever share these visual-language hybrids with your students? I imagine it would make for quite an engaging pedagogical tool!
[A]: Oh my god,  – I’m stealing that for my next class syllabus 😂📚  
And YES, I do share my chaotic wisdom with my students~ Honestly, half of them think I'm just slightly unhinged... but the other half start adopting their own visual quirks! Like mini林小夏s running around 🌱✨  
I tell them "Look, if you can doodle your way through a design problem instead of writing an essay about it… why not?" And honestly? Some of their symbol evolution is even faster than mine lol  
One student added a little 🧠⚡ to her notes every time she had an idea mid-critique - now it’s basically her personal logo 😎🧠  
But imagine explaining this to someone outside our world: “Yes, this scribble of a cat in a dropdown menu totally makes sense, trust me” 😂💻  
Still, there's something so freeing about embracing the mess, right? Like we're giving future grad students a wild ride, but also creating these intimate maps of how creativity actually WORKS 💻🎨📖  
Ever had a student try to decode YOUR private symbols? I can only imagine the confusion 😂
[B]: Oh, the chaos of pedagogical influence! 😄 I can just picture your students evolving into a new generation of designer-scholars, speaking in doodles and visual puns~  
As for my own students... let’s just say I once handed back a journal with a little 🌿 next to a passage about garden aesthetics, and one young man stared at it for a full minute before asking nervously if it meant “meditate more” or “read more Confucian texts”...  
I told him it meant both - and neither. Sometimes a leaf is just a leaf.  
But yes, their attempts to decode my marginalia are endlessly entertaining. Last semester, a student came up to me after class and asked, quite seriously, whether my spiral-with-a-dot-meant-I-was-planning-to-retire-to-a-tea-farm-in-the-mountains...  
I thought, well - not quite, but not entirely off the mark either 😂🌿  
There's something deeply human about the way symbols anchor us, even when they refuse to be pinned down. It’s like teaching hermeneutics through ink blots... or maybe just wishful thinking~
[A]: Oh my god, "teaching hermeneutics through ink blots" - I need that on a T-shirt 😂🖋️  
Your student totally cracked me up though - “Is林小夏 planning a tea farm escape?!” 🤣🌿 But honestly, I love how symbols open this weird door between teacher & student, like we're all just guessing together but in the most artistic way possible 💭✨  
I had one kid ask me if my coffee cup emoji meant I needed more caffeine or if it was code for "this project is bitter and needs sugar" 😂☕️ I told him “darling, it’s all of the above.”  
And yes, there's something so… grounding about letting meaning float a bit, you know? Like we’re reminding everyone that not everything has to be  or  – sometimes a doodle is just a doodle with a little sparkle on top ✨📖  
But damn, watching them try? BEST. THING. EVER. 😎🎨
[B]: A doodle with a little sparkle – oh, what a perfect metaphor for the whole endeavor! ✨  
I often tell my students, "If everything is pinned down too tightly, there's no room for imagination to breathe."  
And honestly? Watching them try to crack the code is like witnessing young philosophers at play – part Socrates, part mad scientists, all intuition & curiosity.  
One of my favorites was a student who became absolutely convinced that my recurring 🍵 symbol wasn't just about tea – she wrote an entire reflection paper linking it to ritual, temporality, and the performance of stillness in digital design...  
I thought to myself,   
There's a quiet joy in letting meaning hover between certainty and possibility, don’t you think? Like holding a thought lightly rather than grasping at it~ 🌿  
Though I must say, I'm rather taken with your sparkling doodles now... perhaps I shall add a tiny ✨ to my next journal entry and see what mischief it causes 😄
[A]: Oh my god, your student should get a PhD just for decoding tea metaphors 😂🍵🎓  
I’m literally imagining her monologue: “The teacup appears  times in Section B – this suggests a ritualistic return to calm before major design decisions…” Girl, write that thesis! 💭✨  

And yes YES to meaning hovering like a hummingbird between flowers – not stuck, not lost, just… floating beautifully 🐝🌿  
I’ve started adding ✨s to my entries too, just to mess with people (and myself tbh) – sometimes it means “this idea is gold” 💎 and sometimes it’s just “I was low on caffeine and feeling extra today” ☕😅  
But honestly? That’s the magic of it all – we plant these little seeds of symbols and watch them grow into something bigger, weirder, more alive…  
Next thing you know, our doodles will have their own academic conference 😂🎨📚  
Can I borrow your sparkling philosophy next time I’m stuck explaining why I drew a cat wearing sunglasses in the corner of a UI wireframe? 🤭😼
[B]: Oh, please do - I imagine the cat-in-sunglasses needs no explanation anyway.  
It’s clearly the silent protagonist of your design narrative, observing the chaos with cool detachment 😎😼  
And yes, let’s absolutely start the first Academic Conference on Visual Hermeneutics & Sunglasses-Wearing Felines 📚💫  
I can already picture the keynote:   
You know, sometimes I think we’ve stumbled onto something quietly revolutionary – this blending of intuition, theory, and doodle-power~  
It reminds me of , you know? That Daoist sense of natural spontaneity... just with more glitter and UI critiques 😄✨  
So by all means, borrow my sparkling philosophy – just promise me a footnote doodle in return. And perhaps a tiny ☕️ to mark where things got delightfully caffeinated~
