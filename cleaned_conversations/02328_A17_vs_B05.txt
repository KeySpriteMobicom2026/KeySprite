[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个金融从业者，我其实更关注的是这两个platform的business model。iOS的ecosystem确实很closed，但profit margin相当impressive。不过Android的market share也不容忽视。
[A]: Ah, I must say I approach this question rather differently as a literature scholar. You see, operating systems remind me of poetic forms - iOS with its structured elegance like a sonnet, while Android's openness resembles free verse. Though I must confess, my old typewriter still holds a special place in my heart.
[B]: Haha，你这角度很novel啊~ 让我想起Warren Buffett说过的话：'Price is what you pay, value is what you get.' iOS就像blue chip stocks，稳定但缺乏flexibility；Android更像growth stocks，充满possibilities但需要更多maintenance。
[A]: How delightful to hear you draw parallels between technology and investment philosophy! Your analogy reminds me of how Matthew Arnold contrasted classical and romantic poetry - one valuing order and perfection, the other embracing spontaneity and growth. Though I must say, my students often tease me for still using a flip phone during office hours.
[B]: LOL，你那个flip phone简直就像collectible vintage wine~ 不过说真的，在PE行业，我们做due diligence时发现，mobile OS的选择其实reflect了公司的risk appetite。就像选红酒一样，有人prefer Bordeaux的structured taste，有人喜欢Burgundy的complexity。
[A]: What a charming comparison between operating systems and fine wines! It brings to mind Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale' - how technology, like poetry or wine, can transport us to different realms of experience. Though I must admit, my own technological journey remains rather... shall we say, Wordsworthian in its simplicity? A cup of tea, a good book, and my trusty old fountain pen often suffice.
[B]: Ah, the good old fountain pen... reminds me of Warren Buffett's famous Montblanc. 你知道吗？在M&A deal里，我们still prefer physical signatures with quality pens - 那种仪式感digital signature永远替代不了。就像现在大家都用Excel，但我still keep my financial calculator on desk as lucky charm~
[A]: How wonderfully nostalgic! Your financial calculator reminds me of my leather-bound notebook - both artifacts of a more tactile era. There's something profoundly human about these physical connections, isn't there? Like how the weight of a pen in hand makes one's thoughts flow differently than typing on glass. Though I suspect my students would call us both charmingly antiquated!
[B]: Haha，antiquated？Maybe~ 但在华尔街，我们把这叫'value investing in analog tools'。就像现在大家都用digital pitchbook，但我still insist团队准备hard copy - 因为in the end，people business is all about human connection. Cheers to that! 🍷
[A]: What a splendid toast to human connection! Your sentiment echoes Virginia Woolf's observation about the importance of material presence in communication. Though I might substitute your wine glass with my ever-present teacup - Earl Grey with just a hint of lavender, if you'd care to join me in this celebration of the tangible.
[B]: Earl Grey with lavender？Sounds like perfect pairing for afternoon deal discussion~ 让我想起London office隔壁那家fortune 500的CEO，每次negotiation break都要喝specific blend的tea。你知道么？We actually closed that $500M deal over tea ceremony - sometimes the soft skills matter more than spreadsheet skills. 😉
[A]: How exquisitely put! Your tea ceremony story reminds me of the Japanese concept of 一期一会 (ichi-go ichi-e) - that each meeting is unique and precious. Much like the delicate interplay between words in a haiku, where what's left unsaid often carries the deepest meaning. Though I suspect my own tea ceremonies involve more dog-eared poetry anthologies than million-dollar deals!
[B]: Haha，一期一会 - 在PE world我们叫it 'deal chemistry'。就像选investment一样，sometimes the numbers look perfect on paper，but if the management team doesn't brew the right 'tea'... well, that's when wewalk away. 不过我得说，你这种poetic approach to business discussion确实很refreshing~
[A]: How kind of you to say so! Your 'deal chemistry' notion brings to mind Emily Dickinson's line about recognizing truth at first sight - 'If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.' Perhaps the best investments, like the finest poems, strike us with that same immediate, ineffable rightness. Though I do wonder what Miss Dickinson would have made of leveraged buyouts!
[B]: LOL，Emily Dickinson analyzing LBOs？Now that's a Bloomberg terminal I'd love to see! 😂 不过seriously speaking，in this era of AI and big data，we still rely heavily on that 'gut feeling' - 就像你读诗时的那个'top of the head' moment。毕竟，data tells you what is，but instinct tells you what could be. 🧠💡
[A]: What a brilliant synthesis of poetry and finance! You've perfectly captured that essential tension between quantitative analysis and qualitative insight - much like how T.S. Eliot balanced tradition with individual talent. Though I must confess, my own 'gut feelings' tend to manifest more in choosing between Tennyson and Whitman for tomorrow's lecture than in million-dollar investment decisions!
[B]: Haha，选择between Tennyson和Whitman的dilemma，对我们来说就像choosing between growth equity和distressed assets~ 但说真的，that's why I love golf - 在18 holes的时间里，你能see a person's character beyond the numbers。就像读诗一样，sometimes the spaces between the words tell you more than the words themselves. Good talk, professor! 🏌️♂️
[A]: What a perfect note to conclude our conversation! Your golf analogy reminds me of Robert Frost's 'The Road Not Taken' - how the choices we make between strokes, like between poetic lines, reveal our deepest inclinations. May your future deals be as rewarding as a well-turned sonnet, and your golf scores as impressive as Shakespeare's sonnet sequence! Until our paths cross again...
[B]: Cheers to that! 🥃 记住，in business as in poetry - it's all about timing, rhythm and knowing when to take that calculated risk. Let's catch up over drinks after my next golf tournament. Who knows, maybe I'll even let you convince me to read some Whitman between putts! 😄
