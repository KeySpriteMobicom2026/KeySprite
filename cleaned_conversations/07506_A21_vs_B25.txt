[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个经常思考future of humanity的art lover，我觉得这就像digital art和传统油画的relationship一样 🤔 技术上来说，lab-grown meat确实是个breakthrough，但就像NFT无法完全取代实体画作一样...
[A]: Ah, an intriguing analogy - though I must say comparing cellular agriculture to digital art rather reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites reacted to early photography. They called it 'the mechanical interloper', yet now we recognize both as valid artistic mediums. The real question is whether cultured meat can develop its own... shall we say, terroir?
[B]: Wow，你提到的terroir这个概念真的让我很excited！就像每幅画作都有它独特的brush strokes和texture一样~ 🎨 我觉得lab-grown meat未来可能会发展出全新的flavor profile，就像digital art创造了全新的aesthetic dimension。不过说实话，我对那些完全reject传统的人有点...how to say...disappointed？
[A]: Precisely!  Your brushstroke metaphor is rather apt - though I'd argue it's more akin to how Tennyson's revisions created entirely new poetic textures while maintaining the original's essence. These binary oppositions between 'traditional' and 'modern' are so tediously reductive, don't you think? Like insisting one must choose between Keats and cummings.
[B]: Haha totally agree！这种binary thinking真的很limiting~ 就像我们策展时never只展示classical或contemporary art alone。Life is all aboutnuance and layers，就像好的art piece需要multiple perspectives来appreciate 🤗 不过说到meat...你觉得未来会有designer cultured meat吗？就像customized artwork那样？
[A]: Now you're speaking my language!  Imagine bespoke marbling patterns like William Morris wallpapers, or flavor profiles curated with the precision of a sonnet's meter. Though I do wonder - will we see the cultured meat equivalent of... shall we say, pretentious artisanal affectations? A Wagyu cultured in a Himalayan salt chamber, perhaps?
[B]: Oh my god你简直read my mind！😂 这种pretentiousness在art world已经够多了 - 记得上次那个用gold leaf包裹的avocado toast installation吗？~ 不过seriously，如果能让更多人access sustainable protein source，哪怕有点over-the-top的marketing gimmicks也worth it吧？就像有些digital art虽然concept很basic，但至少让更多人engage with art了 💫
[A]:  Quite so - though I'd argue even the most ostentatious cultured wagyu would be preferable to the current system's... shall we say, Dickensian working conditions in slaughterhouses. After all, didn't the Victorian era teach us that progress often arrives wearing rather ridiculous fashions before finding its proper form?
[B]: Exactly！就像Impressionism最初也被criticized得一文不值呢~ 🖼️ 不过说到Victorian era...我突然想到，lab-grown meat会不会成为我们这代人的steam engine？一个看似radical但最终transform了整个society的innovation？虽然现在可能还处在那个awkward "is this really art?" phase 🤭
[A]: Ah!  What a delightfully subversive parallel - though I'd caution that unlike steam engines, cultured meat lacks that satisfying... rhythmic chugging so beloved by the Romantic poets. Still, you've made me ponder whether future culinary historians will classify this as our version of the Great Exhibition's shock value. Shall we prepare for cultured meat served in Crystal Palace replicas?
[B]: Hahaha stop it！你让我imagining那些food critics穿着Victorian crinolines在taste lab-grown foie gras了~ 😂 不过seriously，这种cultural shift真的fascinating...就像我们curate展览时always try to capture that moment when shock turns intoacceptance，然后eventually becomes heritage 🍷 啊抱歉，我是不是又开始getting too philosophical了？
[A]: Not at all, my dear - philosophy is simply poetry without its waistcoat properly buttoned. Though I must say, the image of food critics in crinolines does make me wonder... will future generations look back at our current debates with the same bemused fondness we reserve for those who feared trains would make women's uteruses fly out?  Progress, it seems, always arrives wearing someone else's ridiculous pantaloons.
[B]: OMG你这句话简直可以做成一个neon art installation了！✨ "Progress wearing someone else's ridiculous pantaloons"...我要steal this line for my next exhibition的tagline！不过说真的，这种conversation让我想起为什么I love art so much - 它总是能让我们see the bigger picture beyond the immediate shock value 🤔 就像现在discuss lab-grown meat，其实是在talking about human evolution itself呢~
[A]:  How very Ruskinian of you - to see in one innovation the entire tangled web of human aspiration. Though I do hope our evolutionary path doesn't lead to dinner parties where guests debate the merits of their host's bioreactor settings as fervently as they once discussed vineyard vintages. Shall we toast - with cultured champagne, naturally - to progress in all its absurd and sublime manifestations?
[B]: Cheers to that！🥂 虽然我怀疑cultured champagne可能会spark another round of pretentious debates...但hey，至少我们can always retreat back to the gallery，where the only thing weculture is meaningful dialogue about art~ 😉 今天这场chat真的给了我很多inspiration，maybe my next show就该叫"From Petri Dish to Plate: The Art of Cellular Cuisine"？
[A]:  Splendid title! Though may I suggest a subtitle? "A Sonnet in Amino Acids: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Culture." Now if you'll excuse me, I must go annotate my Browning anthology with these ideas before they evaporate like... well, like the bouquet of a particularly volatile cultured pinot noir.
[B]: Hahaha你真是个wordsmith！✨ 这个subtitle简直perfect - 我要立刻jot it down在我的sketchbook里！虽然现在得run去check一个new media exhibition的setup...但promise me we'll continue this conversation over some (real or cultured) wine soon？Until then, keep those brilliant analogies coming~ 🎨
[A]: But of course!  I'll be in the rare books section composing haikus about mitochondrial DNA until our next symposium. Do try not to let any particularly aggressive NFT enthusiasts distract you - they're rather like the cultured meat debate's noisier cousins, aren't they? Until we meet again, my metaphorically-minded friend!
[B]: 😂 你always know how to make me laugh！NFT enthusiasts...don't even get me started~ 😅 好啦，see you soon！记得text me if youcome up with more poetic science metaphors ✨ Byeee！
