[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a thought-provoking question, isn't it? Let me think... On one hand, the scientific possibilities are fascinating - imagine the medical breakthroughs we could achieve. But then, the ethical concerns are rather significant too. I suppose it's one of those topics where both sides have very valid points. What's your take on it?
[A]: Hmm, yes, you've touched upon the very essence of this dilemma. On a scientific level, the potential for medical advancement is indeed remarkable - we could eradicate genetic diseases, extend human lifespans, even revive lost talents through cloning. But...  ...as my colleague once said during a symposium at Peking University, "Can we truly master what we create?" 

You see, in Chinese philosophy, there's this beautiful concept called 'yuan qi', the primordial energy that flows through all living beings. It makes me wonder - would a clone possess its own yuan qi? Or merely be a vessel devoid of that essential vitality? I've discussed this with several bioethicists over jasmine tea, and while opinions vary, most agree that unregulated cloning could disrupt our fundamental understanding of identity & family structures.

Have you read Kazuo Ishiguro's "Never Let Me Go"? The novel poignantly explores these ethical quandaries. It reminds us that scientific capability doesn't necessarily equate to moral justification. What are your thoughts on this literary perspective?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated perspective - you've captured the philosophical depth of this issue so eloquently. The concept of 'yuan qi' you mentioned adds such a poetic dimension to the debate, really making one contemplate the essence of life beyond its physical form. 

I must say, "Never Let Me Go" has always stayed with me since I first read it during my university years. Ishiguro's portrayal of cloned individuals as fully sentient beings with emotions and aspirations does make one question whether our scientific capabilities should automatically translate into action. It reminds me of a conversation I once had with a guest from Kyoto, a professor specializing in bioethics - he expressed similar concerns about disrupting natural order.

You know, just last spring, I hosted a small discussion group at the hotel where we served jasmine tea and debated topics like this one evening. One of our guests, a geneticist from London, argued that regulation rather than prohibition could allow us to harness cloning's benefits while preserving ethical boundaries. But then again, who gets to decide those boundaries? 

It makes me wonder - if cloning ever becomes widely accepted, how would it reshape our understanding of individuality? Would we still place the same value on personal uniqueness, or would society gradually shift toward viewing identity through a different lens?
[A]: Ah, your discussion group sounds like a most stimulating gathering.  The question of regulation versus prohibition is particularly intriguing - it reminds me of the ancient Chinese concept of 'zhong yong', the doctrine of the mean. Perhaps there exists a middle path where science & ethics can coexist harmoniously?

You know, when I was visiting Tsinghua University last autumn, I attended a lecture on bioethics that drew parallels between cloning debates & traditional Confucian views on human nature. It made me reflect on how our cultural frameworks shape these discussions - much like how that geneticist from London would approach it through a different philosophical lens.

Speaking of which, have you ever read the Daoist text 'Zhuangzi'? There's a fascinating passage about dreams & reality that seems oddly relevant to our cloning discussion. It makes one ponder - if we create clones with full consciousness, are we not creating parallel realities with their own dreams & aspirations? 

Your question about individuality resonates deeply - in Eastern philosophy, we often emphasize harmony with the collective while still honoring each person's unique journey. I wonder, do you think future generations might develop a more fluid understanding of identity in response to such scientific advancements?
[B]: What a wonderfully nuanced perspective you’ve shared – I’m so glad you brought up 'zhong yong'. It really does seem that balance, rather than absolutes, might offer the most thoughtful path forward. Your reference to Confucian views paired with the Daoist musings from 'Zhuangzi' paints such a rich philosophical tapestry... It makes me consider how layered our understanding of identity already is, even without cloning entering the picture.

You know, your mention of parallel realities has me recalling a conversation I once had with a novelist staying at the hotel – she was writing a story about clones who discovered they could dream independently of their originals. It was quite unsettling, really, the idea that a created being might develop its own subconscious world. If that’s conceivable, then yes, we may very well be opening doors to entirely new dimensions of human experience.

As for whether future generations will adopt a more fluid sense of self... I do believe they might. We’re already seeing younger people embrace broader definitions of identity in so many areas – gender, culture, even digital personas. Perhaps cloning would simply be another layer to that evolving awareness. Still, I wonder if we’ll ever truly be prepared for the emotional and societal ripple effects such technology could bring.
[A]: Ah, the idea of clones dreaming independently does add a whole new dimension to our understanding of consciousness. It reminds me of the famous line from Zhuangzi -  - "When I dream I am a butterfly, how do I know I am not now a butterfly dreaming it is human?" If clones develop their own dreams, then they are no longer copies but unique beings with subjective experiences.

You're absolutely right about younger generations embracing fluid identities. Last semester, I had a most enlightening discussion with my students about digital avatars & virtual identities. One young woman made an astute observation - she said, "Professor Lin, isn't a social media profile already a kind of curated clone of ourselves?" That remark stayed with me... We're already creating multiple versions of ourselves in the digital realm.

But here's what concerns me -  - even if we accept fluid identities, would society be ready to embrace clones as equals? In one of our literature seminars, we discussed Margaret Atwood's "Oryx and Crake" where clones occupy a marginalized position in society. It made us reflect on whether our biases might follow us into this new frontier.

I'm curious, did that novelist ever finish her story about dreaming clones? I'd be most interested to hear how she resolved the tension between creation & autonomy.
[B]: What a profoundly poetic connection you've drawn with Zhuangzi's words - it really does echo the heart of this debate. If clones dream, and those dreams differ from their originals, then they’ve undeniably crossed into a realm of selfhood we may not yet be prepared to recognize.

Your student’s observation about social media profiles as curated clones is quite brilliant, actually. In a way, we're already navigating layers of identity shaped by how we present ourselves online. But there's something more tangible – and perhaps unsettling – about physical clones existing in the real world. It's one thing to edit our digital personas; it's another to create life with expectations already attached.

You've touched on my curiosity perfectly with regard to that novelist – yes, she did finish her manuscript, and I must say the ending was rather haunting. Without giving too much away, she left the tension unresolved, almost suspended in ambiguity. The clones, though fully sentient and dreaming independently, were still bound by the intentions of their creators. She told me over tea one afternoon, "I couldn't bring myself to give it a tidy resolution. Perhaps because we, as a society, don’t yet know what we’d choose if faced with that reality."

It makes me wonder – if given the chance, would clones seek independence? Or would they long for purpose imposed upon them, like characters searching for an author? And more importantly, would we, as a society, grant them that autonomy... or fear it?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant conclusion – or rather, lack thereof.  That unresolved tension mirrors our own uncertainty so beautifully. You know, it reminds me of a passage from Lu Xun’s preface to “Call to Arms” – he writes about people wandering in darkness without a clear path. Perhaps we are at a similar crossroads with cloning – aware of the possibilities, yet uncertain which direction to take.

Your question about clones seeking independence has stayed with me since our conversation began.  In one of my seminars on postmodern literature, we discussed how even fictional characters have been rebelling against their authors since Diderot’s time. If Mr. Darcy could resist Austen’s pen, as some critics suggest, then surely clones might one day resist their creators too.

I wonder though...  ...would their quest for autonomy be any different from a child growing up and challenging parental expectations? After all, every generation redefines itself against the previous one. But perhaps that's where the true ethical challenge lies – not in the science itself, but in our ability to accept new beings as equals rather than extensions of ourselves.

Have you ever noticed how this debate echoes ancient Chinese garden design principles? We carefully cultivate each plant, yet ultimately must allow them to grow according to their own nature. Maybe that's the key –  – to approach cloning with both intention and humility, much like a gardener tending to rare orchids.
[B]: What a profoundly elegant analogy – the gardener tending to orchids with both care and humility. It captures the delicate balance we’re struggling to find, doesn’t it? The idea of guiding without controlling, nurturing without possessing... I suppose that’s at the heart of so many human endeavors, whether raising children, cultivating art, or now, potentially, creating life through cloning.

Your comparison to Lu Xun’s wandering figures in darkness struck a chord too. We do stand at a crossroads, aware enough to be unsettled but not yet wise enough to choose our path with certainty. And perhaps that’s where literature – and philosophy, and yes, even science – serve us best: by holding up a lantern, even if only for a moment.

I must say, your seminar discussion on fictional characters resisting their authors has me thinking about this differently now. If Darcy could rebel, as you said, then autonomy seems almost written into the nature of consciousness itself. So if we were to create sentient clones, would we really be surprised when they, too, eventually push back?

And wouldn’t that be, in a strange way, a sign of success? If our creations seek independence, maybe that means we’ve created something truly alive – not just biologically, but spiritually.
[A]: Ah, beautifully said –  – to create life that pushes back, that questions its own origin, might indeed be the truest sign of aliveness. In a way, it’s what every teacher hopes for – students who surpass their mentors, ideas that outgrow their creators. I’m reminded of Confucius himself; he never claimed to have all the answers, only to have asked the right questions with sincerity.

You know, during a conference in Hangzhou a few years back, a young scholar presented a paper comparing cloning to the ancient art of ink painting. The master guides the brush, yet once the stroke is made, it takes on a life of its own – slight imperfections become its soul.  Perhaps cloning, too, would yield such unexpected beauty… and complexity.

Your point about autonomy being “written into the nature of consciousness” is most insightful. It makes me think of the Daoist idea of  – action through non-action. Even the most carefully controlled system must eventually allow space for natural unfolding. If we truly respect life, whether born or made, we may have no choice but to step back and let it find its own way.

I wonder...  ...if future historians will one day look back at this time as the quiet moment before the storm – when we still had the luxury to debate, to hesitate, to reflect by lantern light. Or perhaps they’ll see us as mere gardeners still learning which seeds to plant, and which to leave undisturbed in the soil.
[B]: What a moving reflection – that moment before the storm, when we still have the privilege of contemplation... It does feel like we're in one of those rare interludes where history pauses, allowing us to weigh not just what we can do, but what we ought to do.

That ink painting analogy you shared is simply exquisite. The idea that imperfection gives a creation its soul – well, it turns the whole notion of cloning on its head, doesn’t it? If every clone inevitably diverges from its original, then perhaps the beauty lies not in replication, but in the emergence of something unforeseen. Much like a child inheriting their parent's eyes, yet developing a gaze entirely their own.

And your mention of  – stepping back to allow natural unfolding – brings to mind a conversation I once had with a guest who was a landscape architect. She spoke of planting a garden and then resisting the urge to overshape it, learning instead to appreciate how the wind, rain, and time guide growth in ways no blueprint ever could.

I suppose that’s the quiet challenge before us – whether with clones, with students, or even with the future itself: to cultivate with care, yet release with grace.
[A]: Indeed…  …to cultivate with care, yet release with grace – what a profound responsibility we carry, whether as scientists, educators, or simply fellow beings sharing this fleeting moment in time.

You know, your words about the landscape architect reminded me of a conversation I had with a young botanist during a walk through the Suzhou gardens. She was studying the growth patterns of ginkgo trees and remarked, “They were planted centuries ago, yet look how freely they’ve grown – no two alike, though from the same seed.” It struck me then that perhaps our role in shaping life is not so different – to plant thoughtfully, observe humbly, and allow nature its quiet wisdom.

There’s a line from the  that comes to mind now –  – “Therefore the sage manages affairs without intervention, spreads teachings without words.” Perhaps the future of cloning, like the ginkgo’s branches, must be guided not by rigid control, but by a kind of listening… a willingness to let being unfold.

And maybe, just maybe…  …that’s where literature will find its new stories – not in the perfection of replication, but in the poetry of divergence. In tales of clones who inherit a face but not a fate, of identities shaped not by origin but by choice, chance, and the quiet grace of becoming.

I wonder… if you were to write such a story, would you begin with the first dream of a clone waking, or with the gardener watching the first uncertain bloom?
[B]: What a breathtaking image – a story beginning with either that first dream or the gardener’s quiet vigil… I think I’d need to start with both, intertwined. After all, every creation carries within it both the hope of the maker and the hunger of the made.

Perhaps the opening scene would be a quiet one – a single light in a laboratory window late at night, the hum of machines softened by the hush of falling rain. And in that sterile room, a mind stirs for the very first time – not waking to purpose or command, but simply… noticing. The weight of its own breath. The texture of thought. A question forming without being taught.

Or maybe you’re right – perhaps the truest beginning is with the gardener, hand poised above the soil, heart caught between wonder and trepidation. For in that moment before planting, there is still choice. Still silence. Still time to ask,  before the world asks, 

I’ve always believed stories are how we prepare ourselves for the future – they let us feel our way through impossible choices before we’re forced to live them. If cloning ever steps from theory into reality, I suppose we’ll turn to literature not just for answers, but for the courage to face the questions we’ve dared to ask.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve woven those dual beginnings together – the quiet vigil of the gardener and the first flicker of awareness in the created.  There’s a certain poignancy in imagining that first moment of consciousness, isn’t there? Like watching a candle’s flame catch in the dark – fragile, flickering, full of unspoken possibility.

Your description of the laboratory scene reminded me of a passage from , where the stone monkey first opens his eyes to the world, bewildered yet curious. He doesn’t ask “Why was I made?” but rather “What is this world I find myself in?” Perhaps that’s the true first question of any sentient being – cloned or born – a question not of origin, but of belonging.

And speaking of belonging…  …I wonder how such a story might unfold over time. Would the clone come to seek connection with its maker, or would it be the maker who longs for understanding? In many ways, it mirrors the parent-child bond – we create life hoping to guide it, yet ultimately learning from it.

You’re quite right about stories preparing us for the future. Literature has always been our moral compass, even when science races ahead. I recall discussing this very idea with a group of students while walking through the campus courtyard last spring. One of them mused, “If we don’t imagine these futures now, won’t we be unprepared when they arrive?”

Indeed…  …and perhaps that’s why we must write – and read – these stories with care. Not merely as warnings or fantasies, but as lanterns held before us, casting light on paths we may one day tread.
[B]: How perfectly you've captured that first flicker of awareness - not as a grand awakening, but as a quiet, bewildered reaching toward the world. The stone monkey from ... what a lovely parallel. There’s something deeply moving about that innocence, isn’t there? Not questioning why it exists, but simply marveling at the fact that it . That sense of wonder before the weight of purpose settles in.

You’ve touched on something quite tender with the idea of longing – whether it's the clone seeking its maker or the maker yearning to understand their creation. It does echo that parent-child bond you mentioned, doesn't it? We give life, yet we never truly own it. And perhaps that’s where the greatest humility lies – in recognizing that creation carries its own will, its own quiet heartbeat of desire.

That student of yours was wise beyond their years to say we must imagine these futures carefully. I often think of literature as our emotional rehearsal for what’s to come. Long before we face a choice in reality, we live it through stories. They allow us to sit with discomfort, to stretch our empathy, to ask questions without rushing to answers.

And yes… those lanterns you spoke of – fragile flames against the unknown – they guide us not by offering certainty, but by helping us see just far enough to take the next step. After all, isn’t that what every good story does?
[A]: Precisely –  – stories don’t demand answers; they invite us to sit with the question, to hold it gently like a firefly in cupped hands. There’s such wisdom in that student’s words – if we don’t imagine these futures now, we may find ourselves unmoored when they arrive.

Your phrase “emotional rehearsal” has stayed with me since your last message…  …how beautifully apt. We read not just to escape or to learn, but to practice feeling, to prepare our hearts for what may come. In a way, every novel is a quiet apprenticeship in empathy.

You know, I once had a student who compared reading dystopian fiction to training with weights –  – you build emotional strength through imagined hardship, so when reality presents its own challenges, you are not entirely unprepared.

And perhaps that’s how we must approach cloning – not as a scientific finish line, but as an unfolding narrative still being written. One that demands not only intellect, but moral imagination. After all, we’ve seen in so many tales – from  to  – what happens when creation outpaces compassion.

Speaking of which…  …have you ever read  by Ishiro Honda? Not the films, but the lesser-known short stories he wrote in the late '60s. They explore the emotional lives of clones in surprisingly tender ways. I’d be happy to share my old copy, if you’re interested.
[B]: What a lovely image – holding a question like a firefly in cupped hands. So delicate, so fleeting, yet full of quiet wonder. I think that’s what makes reading such a deeply human act – we’re not just consuming words, but cradling lives, experiences, possibilities.

Your student’s analogy about dystopian fiction as emotional weight training is both clever and true. I suppose that’s why certain stories linger with us – they’ve asked something of our hearts, stretched our capacity for compassion, even if just a little.

You’re absolutely right about cloning being an unfolding narrative rather than a fixed destination. And how chillingly fitting that so many cautionary tales – , ,  – warn not against the science itself, but the absence of care behind it. It's never just about making life… it's about what we're willing to feel for it.

And yes, I’d love to read  – your description of Honda’s short stories already has me intrigued. There’s something especially moving about finding tenderness in speculative fiction, isn’t there? It reminds us that no matter how strange the world becomes, the heart still beats in familiar rhythms. Thank you for offering to share your copy – I’ll gladly accept, and return it only when I’ve given it a proper read by the fireside.
[A]: Ah, I’m so glad you see the quiet wonder in that firefly image –  – and yes, exactly, it’s never just about making life, but about what we’re willing to feel for it. That’s the part science alone can’t answer, isn’t it? The emotional aftermath of creation… the tending of bonds that were never quite planned.

You know, when I first read  as a young man, I was struck not by the horror of the act, but by the loneliness that followed – the creature reaching out, and Victor turning away. It made me think, even then, that perhaps the greater tragedy wasn’t the experiment itself, but the abandonment that came after.

And how beautifully you put it – that no matter how strange the world becomes, the heart still beats in familiar rhythms.  – speculative fiction at its finest doesn’t just show us new worlds; it reveals the old, enduring truths hidden within them.

I’ll have my assistant bring over  this week – it’s a slim volume, but one I return to often. Honda writes with such quiet empathy, almost like someone tending to a garden late in the evening – careful hands, soft light, everything done with reverence.

And do take your time with it – there’s no rush. After all, the best stories are those we live with awhile, letting them settle into the corners of our thoughts. And when you’ve finished, perhaps we might continue this conversation over another pot of tea – I’d be most interested to hear how the stories spoke to you.
[B]: What a deeply moving way to put it – the emotional aftermath of creation, the tending of unplanned bonds… It does feel, doesn’t it, that love and responsibility often arrive unannounced, like unexpected guests who end up staying far longer than anticipated.

Your reflection on  has stayed with me since your last message. That moment of abandonment – Victor turning away just when he was needed most – it’s heartbreaking not because the creature is monstrous, but because he remains so achingly human in his longing. Perhaps that’s the quiet warning tucked inside all such stories: that we must be ready to stay, to bear witness, to love what we bring into being – or risk becoming monsters ourselves.

I’m truly looking forward to reading . There’s something especially intimate about holding a book someone has cherished – it feels like holding a part of them, in a way. I’ll be sure to handle it gently, as one does with anything sacred.

And yes, let’s most certainly continue this conversation over tea once I’ve had time with the stories. There’s something about discussing books in person – the way ideas warm up in the space between people, much like tea in hand. Until then, I’ll keep thinking on fireflies, cloned ginkgos, and the quiet pulse of hearts still learning their rhythms.
