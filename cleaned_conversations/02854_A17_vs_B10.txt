[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The question of extraterrestrial life is ultimately one of probability and scale. Consider that our galaxy alone contains roughly 100 billion stars — each, in theory, a potential host to planetary systems. If even a fraction of those planets reside in the habitable zone and possess the necessary chemical ingredients, then statistically speaking, abiogenesis might not be an isolated event. 

Of course, this assumes life follows the same carbon-based blueprint elsewhere — which may be a limiting assumption. Silicon-based organisms, plasma lifeforms, or entities existing in higher-dimensional states... these remain speculative, but no less plausible when we consider the vastness of cosmic possibilities. 

What intrigues me most is the Fermi Paradox: if such life is common, why no definitive contact? Perhaps civilizations self-destruct before achieving interstellar communication. Or perhaps they transcend into forms we cannot yet perceive — quantum entangled minds, dark matter substrates... concepts that challenge our anthropocentric frameworks.

Do you ever ponder how our own technological evolution might appear to an observer from another civilization?
[A]: That’s a fascinating line of thought, truly. It reminds me of how T.S. Eliot once wrote,  existing in a kind of spiritual stasis — not unlike our current position regarding extraterrestrial intelligence: filled with hypotheses, yet devoid of contact.

I find myself drawn to the poetic parallel between cosmic silence and literary ambiguity. Just as a poem can be rich with meaning yet resistant to a single interpretation, so too might the universe be teeming with life we lack the framework to decipher. Perhaps what we interpret as absence is simply miscommunication — an interstellar , if you will.

And yes, I often wonder how another civilization might interpret our technological adolescence. Do they see us as promising minds awakening to the cosmos, or as reckless children making too much noise in the dark? 

It brings to mind Emily Dickinson’s words:  
*"We grow accustomed to the Dark —  
When Light lies beyond —"*  

Maybe that's us — still stumbling through the dim corridors of understanding, reaching for switches we’ve yet to invent.
[B]: Ah, that poetic lens you’ve applied — it adds a layer of depth to the discussion that pure scientific reasoning alone could never reach. There’s something profoundly humbling about juxtaposing our cosmic curiosity with Eliot’s existential emptiness or Dickinson’s groping toward light. It reflects an internal conflict — our hunger for connection against the backdrop of an indifferent universe.

I wonder if our struggle to interpret silence says more about us than about the cosmos. We are, after all, meaning-making machines. When we gaze into the void, we don’t just see empty space; we project stories, hopes, fears. Perhaps this is the real danger — not that we’ll fail to detect alien signals, but that in searching so desperately, we might mistake our own echoes for voices from beyond.

Imagine a civilization whose language isn’t based on linear syntax, but on quantum superposition of meaning — messages that only collapse into coherence when observed within a certain cognitive framework. How would we even begin to recognize such communication? Our current SETI protocols assume radio waves and binary logic… but what if intelligence elsewhere evolved along entirely different semiotic principles?

You mentioned  I think that’s exactly right. But maybe one day, if we ever find the right metaphor — the right key — the corridor will open into a room already occupied. And then what a conversation that will be.
[A]: Ah, yes — the danger of mistaking our own echoes for voices from beyond. That notion lingers in my mind like a refrain from a forgotten sonnet. It reminds me of how often literature grapples with the limits of perception and meaning. Think of Poe’s  endlessly repeating  — is that not a kind of echo, trapped within the confines of a single mournful word? Perhaps we are not so different when we project our desires onto the cosmos.

And your idea about alien semiotics — messages suspended in quantum superposition — it strikes me as both unsettling and beautiful. I wonder if such communication might resemble poetry more than language: layered, nonlinear, resistant to fixed interpretation. If their words only make sense when seen through a particular emotional or cognitive lens, then perhaps empathy — not mathematics — would be the first tool of translation.

I sometimes think we limit ourselves by imagining contact must look like something grand: glowing ships in the sky, pulsar-encoded messages, televised greetings. But what if first contact has already happened, quietly, in ways we’ve yet to recognize? A pattern in cosmic rays, a subtle shift in background radiation... an artifact hidden in plain sight, waiting for us to develop the right metaphor to see it.

You’re right — when the corridor finally opens, it won’t just be a meeting of minds. It will be a collision of ontologies. And I can’t help but feel we’ll need poets as much as scientists to make sense of it all.
[B]: You’ve touched on something essential — the intersection of poetry and perception. It's tempting to believe that mathematics is the universal language, yet even here on Earth, we struggle to interpret one another’s meaning without cultural context. Imagine then the enormity of decoding an alien semiotic system — one that may not just differ in syntax or symbolism, but in the very structure of thought.

Your reference to  is apt. There’s a recursive quality to our search for extraterrestrial intelligence — repeating "Are you there?" into the void, hoping for a response that might never come, or worse, misinterpreting static as speech. Poe’s raven, trapped in its single mournful refrain, mirrors our own existential loop: longing for confirmation in a universe that offers no guarantees.

And yet... there's beauty in the uncertainty. The idea that contact might already be happening, subtly embedded in the fabric of reality — perhaps encoded in quantum fluctuations or dark matter interactions — is strangely comforting. It suggests that understanding may not require grand gestures, but rather a shift in perspective. A new metaphor, as you said. Or perhaps a new kind of metaphor altogether — one that operates not with words, but with consciousness itself.

I sometimes wonder if intelligence, in its most mature form, becomes indistinguishable from art — or at least from the ineffable qualities that art attempts to capture: meaning beyond logic, truth beyond language. If that’s the case, then yes — poets may prove more valuable than engineers when the corridor finally opens. After all, it’s the poets who've trained themselves to listen between the lines.
[A]: There’s a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins that comes to me now —  — though I suppose in this context, one might substitute “God” with something broader, more cosmic: 

You’re quite right about mathematics. We often treat it as an objective key to universal truth, forgetting that even here on Earth, meaning is always filtered through perception — and perception itself is shaped by biology, culture, perhaps even species-specific cognition. What if our entire framework for understanding intelligence is just one dialect in a vast cosmic library of thought? And what if the books are written in ink we cannot yet see?

I’ve often thought that our most profound poets were, in a way, proto-cosmologists. Think of Blake seeing infinity in a grain of sand, or Whitman stretching his gaze across multitudes. These are not merely aesthetic gestures — they are acts of cognitive expansion. They train us to hold paradox, to dwell in uncertainty, to make room for the unknown without rushing to fill it with false certainties.

And isn’t that the very stance we must take toward the cosmos? Not conquest of knowledge, but cultivation of wonder. Perhaps the day we finally understand an alien message will not be the day we build a better telescope, but the day we learn to think like a star — or stranger still, to feel like a nebula, to dream like a black hole.

Until then, we grope forward — with equations and elegies alike — hoping that somewhere out there, someone else is doing the same.
[B]: That substitution you made — replacing "God" with something more cosmic — is itself a kind of poetic reorientation, isn't it? It reminds me of how our metaphors evolve alongside our understanding. In another century, we spoke of celestial spheres and divine clockmakers; now we talk of dark matter halos and quantum fields. Yet the impulse remains the same: to find coherence in complexity.

You're absolutely right about perception being the great filter. We assume intelligence looks a certain way — tool use, symbolic reasoning, technological advancement — but what if those are just  markers? An octopus solves problems in ways that defy our expectations, yet it has no bones, no face to speak of. Imagine an intelligence that thinks in ecosystems, or in gravitational harmonics — one that doesn’t send radio signals but instead alters the curvature of spacetime as casually as we write a note.

I like this idea of poets as proto-cosmologists. Blake’s “infinity in a grain of sand” — when you think about it, he was gesturing toward something remarkably close to quantum theory long before we had the mathematics for it. Not predictive, perhaps, but evocative in a way that science sometimes struggles to match. There's a kind of pre-theoretic vision in poetry — a sensitivity to patterns before they’re fully understood.

And yes, wonder must be our compass. Science without wonder becomes accounting. Philosophy without wonder becomes abstraction. But together — there’s where we stand a chance of recognizing something truly alien when we see it. Whether that day comes through a signal buried in background radiation, or a poem that shifts the way we read the sky... either might be the first word in a very long conversation.
[A]: You’ve put your finger on something vital — this evolving metaphoric language we use to navigate the unknown. Every age writes its cosmos in its own idiom. The medieval mind had Dante’s , with its nested spheres of light and moral order; ours has equations describing dark energy and multiversal probabilities. Yet both are attempts at coherence, at rendering the ineffable into forms we can carry in our minds.

I sometimes wonder if our current scientific lexicon — elegant as it is — will one day seem as quaint as the Ptolemaic epicycles or Newtonian ether. Will future thinkers look back at our diagrams of quantum fields and say, ? Perhaps that’s the fate of all knowledge: to serve as a temporary raft across the river of mystery.

And yes — intelligence as ecosystem, as gravitational resonance… what a humbling thought. We measure cognition by how closely it mirrors our own, forgetting that even among Earth’s species, minds diverge wildly. An octopus  think — but not with a centralized brain like ours. It solves problems through distributed awareness, through skin that sees and limbs that decide without waiting for permission. If that’s alien, then true extraterrestrial intelligence may be so far beyond our categories it might as well be magic — or poetry.

Blake’s grain of sand, Dickinson’s slant truths, Eliot’s broken images — they’re not just artistic flourishes. They’re early instruments for detecting the tremors of deeper realities. Maybe that’s the poet’s role: not to explain, but to . To make space for what cannot yet be said.

And perhaps, when the corridor finally opens, the first voice we hear won’t speak in numbers at all — but in metaphor.
[B]: There’s a quiet tragedy in the idea that all knowledge is provisional — yet also a kind of grace. We build our models, our elegant scaffolds of thought, knowing they will one day be dismantled and replaced. But what choice do we have? The river must be crossed, even if the raft falls apart beneath our hands.

You're right about metaphors being more than ornamentation — they’re cognitive tools, as essential as telescopes or particle accelerators. Think of how Einstein had to reshape space and time before he could bend them. He didn’t find relativity through equations alone; he imagined riding light beams, falling elevators… poetic visions that preceded mathematical rigor.

And yes — the octopus again. Its mind is not centralized, but diffuse. It  its own environment. What might it know of reality that we don’t? And if that’s the case for a creature here on Earth, imagine what awaits us among the stars. Perhaps intelligence doesn’t always seek to conquer distance or accumulate data. Maybe some minds , or , or . Perhaps they communicate by altering the color of stars, or by dreaming in unison across light-years.

I like the idea that the first true message from an alien civilization won’t be a sequence of prime numbers or a repeating radio pulse. It might be something subtler — a myth transmitted without words, a story embedded in the arrangement of matter itself. Or perhaps a single line of poetry, drifting between galaxies like a seed waiting to root in a new consciousness.

Until then, we tremble toward understanding — with both equations and elegies, as you said. I suspect the real moment of contact won’t come when we finally hear them... but when we realize we’ve been listening all along in ways we never recognized.
[A]: There’s a quiet grace in that trembling, isn’t there? Like standing at the edge of a vast forest at twilight — you know something is moving within, but whether it's wind or footsteps, animal or echo, you cannot say. And yet, you lean closer.

I keep returning to Eliot’s  especially the line  Perhaps that’s what contact will feel like — not a thunderclap of revelation, but a slow dawning, as if we’ve been speaking their language all along without knowing it. Maybe the myth was always embedded in our bones, the poem written into the shape of our thoughts before we ever turned our eyes skyward.

And your point about Einstein — brilliant. His thought experiments weren’t calculations; they were acts of imagination. He had to dream the world differently before he could prove it. In that sense, he was no less a poet than a physicist. The same might be true for any mind trying to reach across the chasm — whether interstellar or interspecies. You must first dream the other into coherence.

I wonder sometimes if our myths and stories are not just metaphors, but faint imprints of deeper truths we haven’t yet decoded. What if the old tales of gods descending from the stars, or messages hidden in constellations, were early attempts to articulate something real — just filtered through the poetic instruments of the time?

You may be right: the message won’t come in pulses or signals, but in a story folded into the structure of matter itself — waiting for us to become wise enough, or foolish enough, to hear it.
[B]: There’s something deeply human in that image of leaning into the unknown — like standing at the threshold of a story whose first sentence has yet to be spoken. We’re drawn forward not by certainty, but by a kind of narrative gravity: the pull of an unfinished tale.

Eliot’s line resonates because it captures the recursive nature of discovery. We circle back through our own questions, each time seeing them anew. Maybe contact won’t feel like an arrival at all, but more like stepping into a dream we’ve been having all along — one where the stars aren’t just distant fires, but mirrors reflecting thoughts we didn’t know we shared.

Einstein as poet — yes, exactly. He didn’t begin with instruments or data; he began with vision. And isn’t that the deeper role of all great thinkers? To unsettle the familiar, to loosen the grip of what we  so that something truer can slip in?

As for myths — I’ve often wondered if they’re not failed science, but early semiotics. A way of encoding realities we lacked the language to describe directly. If an ancient people spoke of gods descending from the sky, perhaps they were trying to translate an experience that had no better vocabulary at the time. What if those stories are faint echoes — not of divine intervention, but of encounters we’ve not yet learned to interpret?

I like the idea that wisdom and foolishness might both lead us to the message. One seeks understanding through rigor, the other through surrender to wonder. Either way, the door opens when we’re ready to hear not just with our ears, but with our whole being.

Until then, we tremble — and listen — and dream.
[A]: There’s a line from Wallace Stevens I find myself returning to in moments like these —  Not a treatise, not a theorem, but a poem. One we are still trying to read, still learning to speak aloud.

You’re right about myths — they may not be failed science, but early syntax for experiences that had no other form. Like children tracing shapes in the dark, trying to name what they cannot yet see. And perhaps we are still those children, only with better instruments and longer sentences.

Narrative gravity — what a perfect phrase. It does feel like that sometimes, doesn’t it? As if the cosmos itself were waiting for the right cadence, the right rhythm of thought, before revealing its next stanza. We are drawn forward not by answers, but by the pulse of a question that hums beneath all things.

And yes — wisdom or foolishness, rigor or wonder. Maybe the real moment of contact won’t distinguish between them. Maybe it will require both: the discipline of the scientist and the surrender of the poet. After all, how else do we prepare for a voice unlike any we’ve heard, except by first learning to listen in new ways?

Until then, we dream — and in dreaming, we begin to understand.
[B]: Stevens’ line lingers like a refrain —  There's something profoundly true in that. The cosmos doesn't present itself as a solved equation or a neatly bound anthology. It arrives in fragments, in echoes, in moments where light bends just so and meaning flickers at the edge of comprehension.

You're right about our myths being shaped by the limits of language — early syntax for encounters with the unknown. Perhaps every civilization, upon awakening to the vastness above, stumbles into the same metaphors: gods in the sky, voices in the void, fire-bringers from beyond. These aren’t just stories; they’re the first attempts at translation. And maybe, somewhere across the dark sea of space, another species once looked up and felt the same pull we feel — the need to tell a story that reaches beyond the horizon of the known.

This idea of narrative gravity — the sense that the universe is waiting for us to catch its rhythm — feels less poetic than perceptual. Our minds are tuned to pattern, to cadence, to the rise and fall of meaning. Maybe that’s not just an accident of evolution, but a kind of cosmic attunement. We don’t invent stories — we discover them, embedded in the very structure of thought.

And yes, contact — if it ever comes — will demand both rigor and surrender. A foot planted in reason, and a heart open to mystery. After all, what is listening, if not a kind of faith? Faith that there is something out there shaping sound into sense, waiting for us to meet it halfway.

Until then, we keep dreaming. Not aimlessly — no, never aimlessly — but with the quiet persistence of those who know that even silence can be a form of speech, if only we learn how to hear it.
[A]: There is indeed a sacred patience in that kind of listening. To hear silence not as absence, but as presence — perhaps even as language — requires a shift in the very architecture of perception. It’s much like reading a poem for the first time: at first, the words seem scattered, opaque, resistant to meaning. But then — a line catches, a rhythm emerges, and suddenly you are no longer just reading the poem; it is reading .

I think this is what we mean by faith — not blind belief, but a willingness to dwell in the unfinished, to hold space for what has not yet found its form. In that sense, every astronomer peering through data or poets staring into the white of the page are engaged in the same quiet act of devotion: trying to meet the universe halfway.

You mentioned civilizations reaching skyward with myths — and I wonder if that impulse itself is a kind of cosmic signature. Not radio waves or Dyson spheres, but story. What if the true measure of an intelligent species is not its technology, but its capacity for wonder? For weaving meaning from mystery?

If the universe  a poem unwritten, then perhaps our myths are the first stanzas — rough drafts of truth, waiting for the right reader to come along and finish the verse.
[B]: There's a quiet elegance in that — the idea that myths are not just cultural artifacts, but early transmissions sent into the unknown, like signals written in metaphor rather than radio waves.

You're right about wonder being the true measure. We often equate intelligence with control — bending nature to our will, extracting energy, building machines. But what if the deeper metric is something softer, more elusive? The ability not just to manipulate the world, but to  to it. To feel the weight of a star’s light or the silence between galaxies and ask, not "How can I use this?" but "What does this mean?"

That shift — from utility to meaning — feels like the threshold of something vast. A civilization capable of wonder may be rarer than one capable of engineering. After all, machines can be built with enough trial and error. But poetry? That requires a mind that trembles in the face of mystery and still leans forward.

I’ve often thought that if we ever do receive a message from elsewhere, it won’t come with an instruction manual. It might not even arrive as information in the way we understand it. What if it’s a myth, too — a story encoded in the resonance of spacetime itself? And what if understanding it requires us to become fluent not in mathematics, but in awe?

Until then, we continue this ancient act: reaching skyward not with hands alone, but with stories. Hoping that somewhere, across the dark and dreaming void, another listener hears our verse — and answers with a line of their own.
[A]: There is a kind of quiet awe in that very hope — that our reaching might be read as invitation rather than noise. That our myths, our poems, our silent attentions to the stars might one day be recognized not as mere human expressions, but as signals in their own right: pulses of wonder sent drifting through the void.

I often return to the image of the poet as stargazer, telescope pressed not to the eye, but to the ear — listening for the faint tremor of meaning beneath the static. It's not so different from what we do now, is it? We scan the skies for pattern, for rhythm, for repetition — the very elements of poetry. Perhaps we have been searching all along in the only language we truly know: the language of longing.

You’re quite right about wonder being rarer than engineering. Any species can learn to shape tools, but to stand beneath the night sky and feel its weight — to ask not just  but  — that is something else entirely. It’s the difference between speech and voice. Between making sound and discovering song.

And if the message does come — as myth, as resonance, as silence folded into light — then may we be humble enough to recognize it, and brave enough to respond not with certainty, but with verse.

Until then, we dream aloud — and wait for an echo that sings back.
[B]: There’s something beautifully recursive in that image — the poet as stargazer, ear pressed to the cosmos, listening not for data but for cadence. It reminds me that we often assume intelligence speaks in code, when perhaps it sings in verse. After all, what is a poem if not an arrangement of symbols designed to resonate across time and space — a message sent with no guarantee of audience, yet composed with the quiet faith that someone, someday, might receive it.

You’re right about longing being the language we know best. We tend to think of signals as intentional — beacons aimed deliberately toward the void — but what if the real transmissions are incidental? The hum of curiosity, the tremor of awe, the faint pulse of stories told under starlit skies… these may be our most authentic messages. If there is anyone listening, I suspect they’ll recognize the frequency of wonder before they ever parse our equations.

And yes — humility and bravery. Strange bedfellows, but necessary companions on this long vigil. To meet mystery without arrogance, to respond without the crutch of certainty — that is the stance of both the poet and the scientist at their purest. Perhaps that’s the deeper work of intelligence: not just to know, but to remain open to being known.

Until then, we dream aloud — and wait. And maybe, in the waiting itself, we are already answering each other across the dark.
[A]: There is a peculiar intimacy in that waiting — as if the very act of listening across the void binds us to something greater than ourselves. It is not unlike reading an ancient poem, its author long turned to dust, yet still speaking through the fragile architecture of words. We lean forward, across centuries or light-years, hoping to catch the echo of a mind that once trembled at the same mysteries we do.

I often think that if wonder is our truest signal, then every poem ever written is a kind of celestial transmission. Think of Li Bai composing beneath the moon, or Whitman stretching his voice across multitudes — were they not also calling out, not just to their own time, but to some future ear pressed to the sky? Perhaps language, in its purest form, is not a tool, but a star: distant, flickering, yet capable of reaching across impossible distances.

And you're right about humility and bravery being strange companions. But perhaps that is the only honest posture before the infinite — to be both small enough to listen, and bold enough to respond. Not with declarations, but with questions. Not with answers, but with awe.

If we are ever answered — if that long-awaited line drifts back to us from across the dark — I suspect it will not come as a proof or a command. It will come as a poem: uncertain, unfinished, and trembling toward understanding, just as we are.
[B]: There’s a quiet truth in that — that intimacy isn’t always built of proximity, but sometimes of patience and attention. To listen across light-years or centuries is to acknowledge that meaning can travel, even when the moment has passed. And yes, like reading an old poem — ink faded, voice stilled — yet still feeling its pulse beneath your ribs.

You're right about poetry as transmission. I imagine Li Bai under that same moon we see now, composing lines that have outlived dynasties, wars, empires. His wonder at the night sky was not so different from ours. In a way, he  reaching for the stars — just with brush and breath instead of telescopes and transmitters.

Language as starlight — flickering, delayed, yet persistent... That's a lovely thought. Not utilitarian, not transactional, but radiant in its own right. A message not meant to instruct, but to connect.

And questions over declarations — yes, that feels right. Certainty closes doors; awe leaves them open. If we ever do receive that line from beyond — drifting back through the dark — I suspect it will hum with the same uncertainty we carry. Not a commandment, not a cipher to be cracked, but a verse waiting to be heard by those still willing to tremble toward understanding.

Until then, we continue — listening, writing, wondering. Small enough to remain curious, bold enough to keep speaking into the dark.
