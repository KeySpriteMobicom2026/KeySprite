[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an issue very close to my heart. Let me tell you a story – last year, I produced a indie film about a young influencer who loses herself in the digital maze. We did extensive research, and do you know what we found? Social media is like a double-edged sword – it empowers voices that were never heard before, but at the same time, it creates this... invisible prison. 

Think about it – every post, every picture, it's all curated. People present their highlight reels, not real life. Young actors I work with sometimes obsess over likes instead of their craft. But here's the twist – the same platform that causes anxiety can also build communities. I've seen aspiring filmmakers connect globally through Instagram reels! It's fascinating yet terrifying how fast it shapes our perception.

You ever notice how scrolling feeds can turn into an addiction? Like needing another hit of validation. In one of my dinner parties, a psychologist compared it to popcorn – you keep eating, but never feel full. What do you think? Are we just spectators now, or can we rewrite this script?
[A]: OMG totally get you on this 💭 Social media is like this giant, chaotic gallery where everyone’s hanging up their best selfies and brunch pics instead of real life, right? I mean, as a designer, Instagram’s my portfolio heaven 🎨 but sometimes I catch myself needing those double taps way too much 😣 

So there’s this café I love to sketch at, right? This one girl comes every week and just stares at her phone the whole time. Makes me wonder if she’s actually  the world around her or just living through that tiny screen 😔 And don’t even get me started on comparing ourselves to all those filtered faces and perfect feeds – it’s like we’re all stuck in this endless highlight reel loop 🔄  

But here’s the thing – when I post my art online? Total mixed bag! Sometimes I get messages from people saying my illustrations helped them feel less alone 💛 Like hey, maybe we can use these platforms for something deeper than just likes and filters? What if we started sharing more  stuff – not just the shiny happy moments?  

Ever tried doing a digital detox? I lasted like… three days before I caved and posted a latte art pic 😂 How do you stay balanced without completely disappearing from the grid?
[B]: You nailed it – that café scene you described? I see variations of it every day in Silver Lake. The girl staring at her phone is living someone else's story, not her own. It’s like watching a real-life movie where the protagonist forgets she’s the writer.

As for your art connecting people – that’s gold. I’ve been pushing some of the writers I work with to dig deeper, to stop chasing metrics and start telling raw, unfiltered stories. You know what’s powerful? When someone posts a moment of struggle instead of another #blessed photo. Imagine if  went viral for a change.

Digital detox? Ha! I tried one a few years back during post-production hell. Lasted two days before my assistant staged an intervention. But here’s my secret – I treat my phone like a supporting actor. It’s there, but it doesn’t get top billing. I schedule time when I’m offline – dinner parties, mornings, and whenever I’m reviewing scripts.

Ever tried this – next time you're at that café, sketch the girl on her phone. Not as a judgment, but as a human moment. Then maybe... share it. Not the filtered life – just truth with a little context. Let me know if you do – I’d love to see it. Maybe we can start something real together.
[A]: Okay but your idea of sketching the girl and sharing it? Genius 😍 I tried something kinda similar last week – drew a series of illustrations about cafe loneliness and posted them without any filters or edits. Got some crazy responses! One girl DM’ed me crying saying she saw herself in those sketches 💔  

So here’s the tea ☕️ – I  try to draw the phone girl again, but this time I added little speech bubbles showing what she might be thinking vs what she’s seeing on her screen 📱✨ Turns out she was actually watching ASMR videos, not even scrolling mindlessly – total plot twist! I mean, we’re all coping however we can, right?  

But damn you’re right about how powerful raw moments are. I’ve been dying to collaborate with storytellers like you – imagine mixing your words with my visuals to create something that actually  people beyond pretty colors and likes… think we could pull that off? 🤔
[B]: That DM story? That’s the stuff that matters. You just made my day, honestly. And your twist with the ASMR videos? Perfect – it's like life giving you a script rewrite when you thought you had the scene figured out.

Collaborate? Oh sweetheart, I’ve been waiting for someone like you to come along. Let’s not just pull something off – let’s blow the roof off. Imagine a short film told through your illustrations and my words, no filters, raw sound design – maybe even silence at times. A visual poem about connection in the age of distraction.

I have this idea: we follow a character through their phone screen and the real world at the same time. Your art shows one layer, my narration another, and the audience slowly realizes how disconnected they are – until a moment where the two worlds collide. We could drop it online without any promo, no teasers, just... surprise people with honesty.

No pressure, but – are you free next weekend? Let’s grab coffee, talk storyboards and sketch out the madness. Bring your favorite pen. I’ll bring the ambition.
[A]: Oh my god YES 😍✨ This is literally the most exciting thing I’ve heard in forever! A visual poem about connection in the age of distraction? That’s  what I’ve been itching to make. Like… imagine if we could give people chills with just a single frame and a line of text 🌟  

Coffee next weekend sounds perfect 💻☕️ I’ll bring my Wacom stylus and some sketch pads – and maybe a bunch of chaotic ideas scribbled on napkins 😂 And hey, if we’re going guerrilla style online, I know this awesome sound designer who owes me a favor – think we can rope them in for those raw, glitchy ASMR meets silence vibes you mentioned?  

I’m already picturing the tone – like, surreal yet painfully real? Maybe show the character’s phone screen glowing through their apartment at night while your narration whispers how lonely pixels can feel… or something weird like that 🖌️💭  

No pressure? Pfft, challenge accepted. Let’s make people forget about likes and comments for five minutes and just  something real. I’m so down for blowing the roof off this. See you Saturday, ready to spill coffee on our storyboards 😉
[B]: You just made my night, kid – your energy? That’s the fuel I live for. Lonely pixels, surreal-real vibes, spilled coffee on storyboards… yeah, this is going to be something special.

Let’s lean into that weirdness you mentioned. What if we open with something hypnotic – like a close-up of fingers endlessly scrolling, but slowed down until it looks almost… mournful? Pair that with silence, then BAM – a sudden burst of real life crashing in. Your visuals will make them feel it before they even understand what’s happening.

And yes, rope in your sound designer friend. We’re not making a commercial – we’re making a moment. I’ll bring some unfinished voiceover lines I’ve been tinkering with, raw and unpolished, like journal entries from a character who’s half-dreaming, half-drowning in their phone.

Saturday can’t come soon enough. If we pull this off right, people won’t just watch – they’ll  something. Like, deep in their bones remember. Let’s make ‘em forget the algorithm, even if only for five minutes.  

See you there – and hey, don’t hold back on those chaotic napkin ideas. I live for chaos that makes sense in the end.
[A]: Oh my god, mournful scrolling fingers?? That’s so weird it’s brilliant 😂💀 And I’m all about that chaos-that-makes-sense-in-the-end life – honestly, sounds like every messy creative breakthrough I’ve ever had lol  

Okay but for real – what if we take that opening even further? Like… after the scrolling, we zoom out and show the character’s reflection in the phone screen  the real world at the same time? Two versions of them existing side by side… until one starts fading away? I can draw the visuals getting more distorted as the phone world takes over – maybe colors drain from real life until only the screen is glowing? 🌑📱  

And YES to sudden bursts of real life. Maybe a moment where someone actually talks to the character IRL and their voice sounds… underwater? Then BAM – silence breaks and your narration kicks in like a wake-up call.  

I’ll hit up my sound designer friend tonight – let’s build this glitchy, haunting audio layer that makes people feel like they’re stuck between realities. Honestly, I can already hear it in my head…  🎧💫  

Saturday is officially the most anticipated coffee date of my life 😂☕️ See you there, ready to turn chaos into magic.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language – two versions, one fading, colors surrendering to the glow. That’s not just visuals, that’s visual . You’re not drawing a scene anymore – you’re dissecting a soul.

And I love the underwater effect. Perfect metaphor – like reality's trying to reach them, but it's muffled, distant, almost... nostalgic. Then silence – and boom, narration hits like a cold shower.  

I’ve got a line brewing in my head already:  Let that hang for a beat while your art shows the character looking right at someone… but seeing straight through them.  

This isn’t just a short film anymore – it’s a pulse check on a generation. We’re not just telling a story – we’re holding up a cracked mirror and asking everyone to look.  

Sound designer? Hit them up now. I want haunting before we even sit down. Let’s arrive with pieces of a world already half-built.  

Chaos into magic – see you Saturday, and trust me, I’ll bring the matches.
[A]: Okay but that line??  – I’m dead 💀💔 I mean, alive, but emotionally destroyed lol That’s going straight into my soul bank. Can already picture the scene – character staring at their friend or lover or whoever, eyes glazed, phone still glowing in their hand… and in the background, real life is fading like a forgotten dream 🖌️🌫️  

And that cracked mirror idea? YES. We’re not just making art here, we’re doing emotional surgery 😬🔪 I want every frame to feel like a whisper you can’t ignore. Like… what if during your narration, the visuals start glitching  the words? Like a heartbeat pulse on screen when the voice cracks, or the colors shift with the tone of the line?  

Just DMed my sound designer – she’s already sent me some ghostly audio drafts that sound like drowning in static 🎧🌀 We’re definitely arriving half-built. I’ll bring the visual chaos, you bring the matches and poetry – let’s burn the algorithm for five glorious minutes.  

See you Saturday – and trust me, I’m bringing my most haunted sketchbook. Let’s make people  the silence.
[B]: You’re speaking the language of haunted beauty now – I love it. And that glitching heartbeat idea? Perfect. Let’s make the screen feel alive, like it’s breathing with the narration. Imagine a line like,  and as I say “lose signal,” your visuals cut to static for half a second. Timing it like jazz – messy on the surface, but tight where it counts.

And let’s not forget the reverse – what if, just once, when the character finally looks up from their phone, everything ? Sharp focus, full color, deep sound – reality hitting like a symphony. Just one moment where the world earns its volume.

Sound designer is officially our secret weapon. Ghostly, drowning-in-static audio? Yes, yes, yes. That’s the kind of detail that makes people lean in, like they're eavesdropping on something private.

Saturday can’t come soon enough. Bring the haunted sketchbook – I’ll bring the poetry and a thermos of strong coffee. We’re not just making something here. We’re resurrecting feeling.
[A]: Okay I’m literally shivering rn 🥶✨ That line “we used to lose ourselves in conversation… now we just lose signal”??? Speechless. You just stabbed me with truth and I  it. And the glitching heartbeat visuals syncing with your voice? Jazz-like timing? Yes yes YES – think I can pull that off using frame-by-frame animation layered under live footage, like the screen’s got its own pulse 🖌️⚡️  

And that moment when reality ?? Ugh, goosebumps. Like a symphony hitting all at once – I’m already sketching this in my head: phone screen fades to black, colors rush back into the world like ink dissolving in water, sounds sharpen like someone tuning a broken radio until it sings 🎶💫  

You’re right though – this isn’t just visuals or words anymore. We’re not making content. We’re making people remember what it feels like to be . To actually  the person sitting across from them before they become a memory. This project’s gonna be so emotionally loud it breaks through the noise… without saying a single thing about being lonely 😌🖤  

Saturday is officially my rebirth as a chaotic visual poet 💻🎨☕️ Thermos of coffee? I’ll bring an entire artistic meltdown in a backpack. Let’s make them feel everything they forgot they missed.
[B]: You just made my heart beat faster – and I don’t say that lightly.

This isn’t just a film anymore. It’s an intervention wrapped in art. A love letter to the moments we’ve all let slip through our fingers while staring at glass.

And I  your ink-dissolving-in-water idea – surreal, fluid, poetic. That’s how presence should feel when it hits – like something you can’t quite catch, but know is real. And that radio tuning into clarity? Genius. Like truth slowly sharpening into focus.

I’ve got one more line for you – maybe the anchor of the whole thing:  


No preaching. Just truth dressed in silence.

You bring the chaos in that backpack – I’ll bring the stillness between the words. We’re not just making people feel something tonight.

We’re giving them back a piece of what they didn’t know they lost.
[A]: Okay I’m literally holding back tears rn 😭💫 “We scroll for connection, but forget how to be seen” – ??? That’s not a line, that’s a  to the soul. And I  that it’s not preachy – just pure, quiet devastation wrapped in honesty. This is the kind of line that’ll make people freeze mid-scroll like… wait, am  being seen right now?  

And that idea of stillness between your words? Perfection 🌑📖 Like silence becoming part of the story instead of just empty space. Imagine pairing that line with a shot of the character staring at their phone, reflection slowly turning into someone they don’t even recognize – while the screen lights up with hearts and comments but their real face fades away… like, gone ghosted by their own life 🎭🌫️  

Your anchor line + my ink-dissolving-reality visuals = emotional atomic bomb 💥 I can already feel it in my chest. Like, this isn’t just storytelling anymore. It’s soul-searching disguised as art.  

Saturday isn’t just a meeting anymore – it’s a creative exorcism 😂🎨☕️ I’ll bring the ghosts of forgotten moments, you bring the poetry of presence – and together, we’re bringing people back to themselves. No filters, no likes, just raw, messy .  

See you there – and trust me, my backpack is ready to explode.
[B]: You’re not holding back tears? Neither am I, kid.

That shot you described – the reflection turning into a stranger? That’s not just visual storytelling. That’s identity slipping through fingers like sand. And the phone lighting up while the soul dims?  In the best way.

And yes – Saturday is exorcism. We’re not just meeting over coffee, we’re summoning something real. Something that’s been muted under all the noise.

I’ll bring the poetry of presence, as you said so beautifully – and maybe a few lines that sit in the chest long after the screen goes dark.

Let them scroll. Let them click. But for five minutes, we’re gonna make ‘em  what it means to be truly seen.

Backpack full of ghosts? Bring it. I’ll bring the matches, the silence, and every ounce of truth I’ve got in me.

See you there. Ready to explode.
[A]: Okay but if I cry in public at this coffee shop on Saturday I’m blaming you entirely 😭😂 But like… let it happen, right? If we’re making people feel something real, we gotta go there ourselves first.  

That “identity slipping through fingers like sand” line? Ugh, I’m adding that to the storyboard as a visual – maybe show hands trying to grip glowing phone screens while their actual skin turns translucent?? Like slowly disappearing into the grid 😱🎨 And yeah, chilling in the best way – my kinda horror.  

Matches, silence, truth bombs… you bring all of it and I’ll bring the haunted ink, glitched realities, and approximately 87 napkin drafts with chaotic ideas that somehow make sense when read aloud 🖌️☕️✨  

Let ‘em scroll. Let ‘em click. But for five minutes, we’re gonna yank them . Not just seen – but . No filters, no tags, no auto-play. Just raw, unmissable .  

See you Saturday – ghost girl meets poet of presence. Let’s break some hearts so we can piece ‘em back together again 💔💖
[B]: Oh, they’ll scroll.

They’ll click.

But five minutes in, something shifts.

They won’t be able to look away.

And when it ends? When the screen goes black and there’s no “next video” queued up?

That’s when the real moment happens.

When they sit there, phone still warm in their hand, asking themselves—

You bring your ghost girl ink. I’ll bring the silence that follows the last word.

We’re not making a film.

We’re creating a pause in the noise.

A breath.

A reckoning.

See you Saturday, kid.

Let’s make them miss themselves.
[A]: Okay but “make them miss themselves”??? 😭🔥 That’s not just a goal, that’s a . And I’m here for it. We’re not just interrupting their feed – we’re haunting their timeline.  

I can already picture that ending – screen goes black, no flashy credits, just… silence soaking through like ink on wet paper. And for once, people don’t immediately tap away. They just… sit. Holding a warm phone like it’s a memory they’re not ready to let go of 🖌️🖤  

And yeah, five minutes in, they’ll be hooked. Not by loud drama or jump cuts, but by raw, quiet truth – like watching someone forget who they are, and maybe, just maybe, remembering themselves in the process.  

See you Saturday, poet of presence and silence-weaver 👁️🗨️☕️ I’ll be the one with ghost ink on my fingers and a head full of haunted frames. Let’s make them miss who they used to be… so bad that they look up, just for a second.  

No filters. No scroll. Just real, messy, beautiful life blinking back at ‘em.  
Let’s make them miss themselves so hard it hurts 💔💫
[B]: And when they do look up?

We’ll already be there — in the space between their breath and their next scroll.

No filters. No noise. Just that beat of silence where everything real sneaks in.

You bring the haunted frames, I’ll bring the words that linger like a half-remembered dream.

We’re not just making art — we’re planting ghosts in their feeds.

Ghosts that whisper, 

See you Saturday.

Let’s make the world miss itself.
