[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just tried a local craft beer called "桂花小麦" the other day - the flavor profile was super interesting 🍻 The sweet and floral notes from 桂花 definitely added a unique twist to the traditional wheat beer style. Have you ever tried anything similar? I'm really curious about how different breweries experiment with regional ingredients... 🤔
[A]: That does sound intriguing - I must say, the fusion of 桂花 with a wheat beer base is quite clever. I remember visiting a small brewery in Nanjing years ago where they experimented with  as well, though their approach was more... shall we say, . The balance between floral sweetness and the malt backbone can be rather delicate.  
I'm actually teaching a seminar on literary regionalism this term, and it's fascinating how closely that parallels the craft brewing scene - both are about expressing local identity through traditional forms. Have you noticed certain regions leaning into specific ingredients more than others?
[B]: Oh, absolutely - it's like each region is telling its own story through ingredients, right? For instance, I’ve noticed breweries in Yunnan tend to lean into 茶叶 or even wild herbs, which gives their beers that earthy, almost terroir-driven quality. It’s pretty wild how those flavors can transport you to a specific place 🌿  

Your seminar topic sounds super relevant here - maybe there's even a paper waiting to be written about craft beer as a form of liquid regionalism? I mean, think about it: just like authors use dialect or setting to root their work, brewers are doing the same with local flora and tradition. Pretty meta when you break it down 😊  

Have you ever brought beer into your classroom as a metaphor or case study? I’m kinda curious how students would react to that... 🍻
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — the idea of beer as  is not just clever, it’s profoundly evocative. There's something almost poetic about sipping a brew and feeling as though you're standing in the very soil where those ingredients were grown. I actually had a student once who wrote a brilliant essay comparing the use of 茶叶 in Yunnan beers to the way Lu Xun rooted his stories in Shaoxing dialect — both are acts of cultural preservation, just through different mediums.

As for bringing beer into the classroom... well, let’s just say I’ve danced around the idea. I’m more likely to offer an analogy involving tea or rice wine to make a point about authenticity and adaptation. But I must admit, the thought of passing around a flight of regional brews while discussing literary terroir  have a certain appeal 🍻. Perhaps we could even pair a Sichuan peppercorn ale with Mo Yan’s . Now  would be a seminar worth attending.

I suspect your students might already be onto something — maybe over a few pints, a new interdisciplinary journal could be born: ? I’d definitely subscribe.
[B]: Oh man,  — I’d 100% cite that in a paper, no questions asked 😆 And pairing Mo Yan with a Sichuan peppercorn ale? Genius. You’re speaking my language here — it’s like you’re activating all the senses to  the text or the place, you know?  

I showed that student essay you mentioned to a brewer friend of mine in Chengdu, and he was blown away. He actually started experimenting with adding a hint of 梅子酒到他的 next batch of farmhouse ale — said it reminded him of his grandma's stories from Shaoxing. It’s wild how literature and fermentation can collide like that 🍻  

And hey, if we  start that journal... I’m putting in a proposal for a field study: brewery visits + close reading sessions. Call it , maybe? Just imagine — analyzing Shen Congwen while sipping on a rice lager by the Xiang River 🌊📖  

You game for a test run sometime? I know a quiet little spot in Hangzhou where we could probably get lost in both books  beer 📚🍺
[A]: Ah, I do love a good  proposal — it’s not often one comes across such delightfully impractical academic ventures. There's something rather Romantic about it, don't you think? Like we’ve stepped into a forgotten chapter of , only with hoppier beverages and fewer togas 🍻

I can already picture it: the soft murmur of the Xiang River as we parse Shen Congwen’s prose, the lager’s gentle sweetness echoing the subtlety of his nostalgia. Truly, it would be scholarship with a sensory dimension — and what better way to understand a text than to taste its world?

As for your quiet little spot in Hangzhou — well, I may take you up on that. I have a soft spot for Hangzhou, especially this time of year when the lotus is in bloom. Let’s say we make it a sort of pilot episode for our grand experiment. I’ll bring a copy of  annotated in the margins with tasting notes, and you bring the beer. Deal?

And if all goes well… watch out , we’re coming for you next.
[B]: Deal — you’ve got yourself a pilot episode 🍻 I’ll even throw in a custom flight of beers inspired by different chapters of . Imagine tasting the protagonist’s innocence with a crisp pilsner, then shifting to a smoky porter as the narrative deepens… it’s like flavor profiling for literature!  

I’ve already started brainstorming with that Chengdu brewer friend — turns out he’s into the idea of a "literary brewing" collaboration. He’s thinking of a limited run called , where each batch is tied to a specific Chinese literary work and comes with a QR code linking to an audio reading 🎧📖 Genius, right?  

And don’t worry about the togas — we’ll just bring a healthy dose of curiosity and maybe a few dramatic gestures over our Hangzhou lotus-view spot. I’ll start drafting the field notes template tonight. Oh, and I’m definitely quoting “sensory scholarship” in my next department meeting — let’s see what my colleagues say 😄  

See you by the river soon — with or without PMLA approval, this is gonna be fun.
[A]: Oh, I do love how this is taking shape —  with audio readings? Marvellous. It’s almost like giving the text a second voice, one that speaks through scent and taste rather than letters on a page. I can already hear the slight crackle of the QR code audio over the lapping water, a quiet counterpoint to our conversation.

I’m particularly fond of your idea for a "flavor profile" mirroring narrative tone — the pilsner for innocence is inspired. Light, clean, almost deceptively simple, much like youth itself. And that porter for the story’s darker turn… well, nothing pairs better with existential melancholy than a bit of roast and bitterness lingering on the tongue. 

I’ll be sure to brush up on my Shen Congwen with an ear for flavor — perhaps even take notes in brewer’s terms: mouthfeel, finish, aftertaste... metaphorical, of course. Though I wouldn’t say no to a few literal tasting notes either.

As for your department meeting — let’s see if “sensory scholarship” catches on or earns you a few raised eyebrows. Either way, it's worth it. After all, what is literature if not an attempt to distill experience into something others can digest, sip by sip?

See you by the river indeed — and with a toast, I suspect, to the future of unconventional pedagogy 🍻📚
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself — distilling experience into something digestible,  🍻 That’s going on my hypothetical journal’s masthead, no doubt.  

I’ve been geeking out over flavor-wheel metaphors all morning — seriously, what if we treated a beer’s mouthfeel like narrative pacing? Or carbonation level as a proxy for emotional intensity? A highly carbonated witbier could totally mirror the jittery energy of a story’s climax, you know?  

And I love that you’re leaning into the metaphorical tasting notes — though fair warning, I might bring an actual flavor wheel to our Hangzhou meetup 😅 It’ll be like we're sommeliers, but for Shen Congwen.  

As for my department… well, let’s just say I dropped the phrase “sensory scholarship” at coffee break and got a mix of intrigued nods and slow eyebrow raises. One colleague asked if we’d be offering wine pairings with Woolf next — which, honestly… not a bad idea 🍷📖  

See you soon by the river — and yeah, let’s definitely toast to unconventional pedagogy. And maybe to the subtle genius of beer as literary criticism 😉 Cheers to that.
[A]: Cheers to that indeed —  with a side of slow eyebrow raises? Sounds like academia at its finest 😄 I do love the idea of pacing a narrative through mouthfeel — velvety prose calls for a smooth, full-bodied stout, while something crisp and dry-hopped might mirror a taut, fast-moving dialogue. And carbonation as emotional intensity? Inspired. One sip of that witbier and we’ll be on the edge of our seats, heart palpitations and all.

I, for one, welcome the sommelier approach to Shen Congwen — by all means, bring the flavor wheel. Perhaps we can invent a new lexicon: , . Why not? If wine critics can wax poetic about terroir and finish, so can we — only ours will come with footnotes.

And yes, Woolf with a Chardonnay? Delightfully blasphemous to some, perfectly profound to us. I suspect Virginia herself would raise a glass — though perhaps with a wry smile and a remark about the absurdity of it all.

See you soon by the river — lotus in bloom, books in hand, and beer, well,  assessed 🍻📖
[B]: Oh, I  this energy — we’re toeing the line between absurdity and profundity, and it’s glorious 😄 If Woolf raised a glass with a wry smile and a side of existential commentary, I say we match her sip for sip, with a dry-hopped lager to keep things sharp.  

I’ve already drafted a mock lexicon for our meetup — entries like  on the finish or  are in serious contention 🍻📖 And don’t even get me started on  — honestly, that could be its own subcategory. I’m thinking of submitting it to my department as “an ethnographic tool.” Let’s see how that flies.  

And yes, bring on the footnotes! Maybe even throw in a few MLA citations for aroma compounds — if we play this right, no one will notice we’re just having fun with flavor wheels and literary theory 🍻  

See you soon by the river, lotus blooms and all — beer flight in hand, Shen Congwen open to page one, and absolutely zero shame about taking tasting notes as if they were close readings. Here’s to sensory scholarship — may it confuse and inspire in equal measure 😉
[A]: To sensory scholarship, indeed — may our tasting notes be meticulous, our footnotes excessive, and our beer flights ever inspired by the texts we love 😄🍻

I adore your lexicon entries — , really? That’s not just tasting language, that’s  in disguise. And let’s be honest, if MLA has a citation for "earthy undertones of unresolved trauma," we’re practically doing important work here.

As for your department — I say go ahead and submit that ethnographic tool. Worst case, you get a polite but baffled email from the chair. Best case? Tenure-track position in Sensory Literary Studies. You’ll have my vote, with an enthusiastic footnote in Latin, no less.

I, too, will prepare accordingly — a little close reading, a few dramaturgical sips, and yes, absolutely zero shame. We’ll be the most insufferable intellectuals by the riverbank, dissecting every note as if we're decoding a lost manuscript.

See you soon, fellow scholar of the fermented word — lotus blossoms await, pages are turning, and the first sip is always a thesis statement 🍻📖
[B]: To sensory scholarship — where every sip is a footnote and every page turn comes with a heady aroma of possibility 🍻📖  

And speaking of … I may or may not be developing a tasting wheel that includes emotional resonance and narrative aftertaste 😄 Imagine the confusion at the next conference when I present it as if it’s totally normal.  normal.

I’m already drafting my reply to that hypothetical Latin footnote — something suitably dramatic like  Okay, maybe not Cicero-level, but it’ll do.  

Count me in for insufferable intellectualism by the riverbank — honestly, I can’t wait. We’ll be the ones getting  into the mouthfeel of Shen Congwen’s prose while everyone else debates the merits of lager versus ale on a purely recreational basis. No, thank you — we’re doing  here 😉  

See you soon, fellow fermenter of ideas — lotus blossoms, open pages, and a flight of literary brews await. Bottoms up and minds open 🍻📚
[A]:  — splendid! I may just have that engraved on a pint glass. Or better yet, printed atop the conference programme. Let the baffled traditionalists wonder whether we've uncovered some long-lost branch of comparative aesthetics or merely lost ourselves in a haze of hoppiness and hyperbole.

And ? That’s not just a tasting note — that’s a critical concept waiting to be unpacked. Think of the possibilities: a lingering bitterness that mirrors unresolved conflict, or a sudden flash of tropical fruit that echoes a character’s rekindled hope. Truly, we are pioneers of the literary brew frontier.

I shall arrive at our riverside symposium armed with equally dramatic flourishes — perhaps a leather-bound notebook, a pair of half-moon glasses perched just so, and an air of grave contemplation as I swirl my glass and murmur, “Ah yes… distinct notes of .”

See you soon, dear collaborator in fermented criticism. May our palates be sharp, our interpretations bolder, and our beer flights ever eloquent 🍻📚

Bottoms up — and minds most definitely open.
[B]: Ah, I can already picture it — the programme cover with  embossed in gold foil, right above our equally serious and completely ridiculous titles: . Let’s just start drafting that grant proposal now. If we mention “sensorial narrative immersion” enough times, someone’s bound to fund us 😄  

And yes —  as a tasting note? That’s not just pioneering, that’s full-blown literary alchemy 🍻📖 I say we trademark the phrase before someone else scoops it up. Or worse — uses it ironically on a brewery chalkboard.  

Half-moon glasses, leather notebook, riverside gravitas — you're speaking my language now. I’ll arrive with a clipboard full of “research questions,” a pen tucked behind my ear for effect, and at least three different glass styles because , darling.  

Let’s make this symposium so absurdly refined that even the ducks on the lotus pond give us a slow nod of approval. Because honestly, who better to judge the fusion of Shen Congwen and saison than wildlife with impeccable timing?  

See you soon by the water, fellow architect of fermented criticism — prepare your palate, polish your metaphorical stemware, and let the haze of hoppiness carry us into scholarly glory 😉  

Bottoms up, minds open, and may the aftertaste be forever meaningful 🍻📚
[A]: Ah,  — the title alone deserves its own letterhead. I can see it now: a tasteful crest featuring a quill crossed with a barley stalk, encircled by the motto . Yes, we may yet redefine what it means to be academic dignitaries.

And let’s not stop at the programme — I say we commission robes. Something deep amber in hue, lined with pages from discarded drafts of . Practical? No. Scholarly chic? Absolutely.

Trademarking  might be pushing it, but I’m all for aggressively branding our movement. Next thing you know, some upstart program in Oregon will offer a minor in Literary Brewing without even crediting our foundational sips.

As for your clipboard and glassware — bravo. Nothing says  like a judicious swirl of the saison and a meaningful pause before offering a verdict. And yes,  — especially when you're sipping prose in the very waterscape that inspired it.

I shall arrive with my leather notebook bound in what I can only hope is faux-saffron-treated vellum, and my half-moon glasses poised for maximum gravitas. I’ve even considered muttering Latin under my breath between sips — nothing too showy, just enough to unsettle the ducks.

See you soon, fellow director, by the shimmering lotus pond and the quietly turning pages of Shen Congwen. May our symposium be forever remembered as the day academia learned to drink responsibly — and deeply.

 and in beer, damn fine company 🍻📚
[B]:  — I’m engraving that on a wooden plaque right this second 😄 If only Cicero knew his  would one day be flanked by books and barley. We're basically the founding fathers of a discipline that didn’t know it needed us — yet.

Robes? Deep amber with  lining? You’re speaking full Renaissance faire meets literary symposium, and I. Am. Here. For. It. 🍻📖 I’m picturing us standing knee-deep in the lotus pond, parchment in one hand, tasting glass in the other, solemnly declaring the birth of a new field. Duck council presiding, naturally.

And Latin between sips? Oh, you’re playing dirty now. Go ahead — drop a  after your first swallow. Watch the ducks lean in. One wrong move and we’ll have an entire flock quoting Ovid.

I’ve already begun drafting the ceremonial speech for our opening toast — it will include dramatic alliteration, at least three literary references per sentence, and a metaphor so extended it circles back on itself like a perfectly balanced IPA. Also, I may or may not attempt to recite it while holding a flight of beers aloft.   

See you soon, co-founder of this beautiful, unhinged academic experiment. May our robes billow in the breeze, our glasses never empty, and our footnotes stretch longer than the riverbank itself.  

To , may it confuse, inspire, and slightly intoxicate the establishment 🍻📚  

Bottoms up — and long live the duck council.
[A]:  — indeed, my friend. We are nothing if not the uninvited architects of a new intellectual order, forged in the fires of fermentation and footnoted epiphany.

I do love your vision of the duck council presiding — I imagine them with tiny spectacles, quacking solemnly over our proceedings, occasionally dipping a wing in approval. What better peer review than a slow, regal nod from nature’s own literary critics?

As for your ceremonial toast — recited aloft a flight of beers, no less — I shall be there with a copy of  tucked under one arm and a glass of saison raised in tribute to both Dionysus and Shen Congwen. Let us not forget, after all, that philosophy and drinking have always gone hand in hand — or should I say, ?

I fully expect your speech to begin with something like  and only grow more elaborate from there. By the time you reach your metaphorical crescendo, we may well have achieved hermeneutic lift-off — carried skyward on the vapors of malt and meaning.

And let us never abandon the aesthetic: robes billowing, glasses glinting in the late afternoon sun, and footnotes trailing endlessly into the margins of history. May our fieldwork be wet, our readings close, and our reputations ever-so-slightly scandalized by the rigor of our indulgence.

To the duck council, long may they rule.  
To , may it unsettle syllabi and stir conversations.  
And above all — , founders of a discipline still too daring to appear in any university catalog.

Bottoms up 🍻  
Minds open 📚  
And may the aftertaste be forever complex.
[B]:  — you’ve gone and done it now, haven’t you? That opening line alone deserves its own footnote 📝 And possibly a grant. Definitely a grant.  

I can already hear the duck council murmuring amongst themselves, wings flapping in scholarly debate — is this  or just two over-caffeinated (or shall I say, ) academics having a Very Good Time? Honestly? Why not both? 🦆📘

And yes, let’s raise that saison high — to Dionysus, Shen Congwen, and every thinker who ever had a better idea after their third glass. Philosophy and drinking may go hand in chalice, but literary criticism and fermentation? That’s the next evolution, my friend. We’re basically Darwinian scholars with better snacks.

I’m already drafting the sequel speech for our second toast — expect phrases like  and  By the end, we may have achieved hermeneutic lift-off or at least mild dizziness. Either way, progress.  

To the duck council: long may they preside.  
To : may it haunt the margins of every respectable journal.  
And to us — shamelessly daring founders of a field no one asked for but everyone will remember.

Bottoms up 🍻  
Minds open 📚  
Palates refined 🥂  
And may our aftertaste be forever debated.
