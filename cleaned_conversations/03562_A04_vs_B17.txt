[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得universal basic income可行吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a complex question. I suppose one could draw parallels between the ideals of universal basic income and William Morris's vision of a utopian society in . There, the absence of economic coercion allows every individual to pursue creative and intellectual endeavors freely. Yet, as with any theoretical framework, its practical implementation raises concerns about sustainability, motivation, and scalability—particularly in modern, heterogeneous societies where consensus on value systems is far more elusive than in Morris’s imagined world.
[A]: Interesting comparison 😊. 你提到William Morris的乌托邦式愿景，确实让我们联想到一个没有经济压迫的社会有多美好。不过说到可行性，我觉得UBI和语言政策有点像 —— 理论上很理想，但落地时得考虑太多变量。比如在台湾，我们做过类似实验，结果发现有些人的确会减少工作时数，但更多人选择把时间用在进修或照顾家庭上 🤔。  

但从财政角度来看，就像你说的，持续性是个大问题。你觉得像新加坡这种高度资本主义的城市国家，有可能找到一种既能维持经济动力，又不会加剧贫富差距的中间路线吗？我最近在研究东南亚多语环境中的社会公平议题，感觉这个问题也绕不开文化价值观的底层结构呢 🌏✨
[B]: Ah, you’ve touched on something quite profound—how cultural values underpin not only economic models but also the very way societies define "fairness." In Singapore’s case, there’s a fascinating tension between Confucian collectivism and Western neoliberal pragmatism. One might say it’s caught between two poetic traditions—one valuing harmony and filial duty, the other emphasizing individual agency and competition.

I wonder if a hybrid model could emerge, one that draws from what anthropologist James C. Scott called “metis”—the practical knowledge gained through lived experience. If Singapore were to design UBI-like structures informed by local  spirit, where mutual aid was once second nature, perhaps redistribution could be framed not as dependency but as reinforcing social interdependence. After all, isn’t poetry itself a form of basic income? It gives value to expression without immediate utility, yet sustains our inner lives immeasurably.
[A]: Hmm, 把UBI和诗歌做类比挺有意思的 🤔。你说得对，诗歌虽然没有 immediate utility，但它维系了我们内在的生态 —— 就像UBI试图维系人们在经济结构中的基本尊严一样。  

说到新加坡的 hybrid model，我觉得metaphor用得很精准 😊。“Kampung spirit”这种非制度化的互助网络，其实跟UBI背后的“保障基本生存”的理念很相似。只是现代社会太强调效率和竞争，反而让人忘了人与人之间那种自然的连结 💭。  

不过话说回来，你有没有读过Amartya Sen的capability approach？他在《Development as Freedom》里讲到，真正的公平不是资源分配本身，而是每个人能通过这些资源实现什么样的潜能。这让我想到语言教育——如果我们从小就在multilingual context中培养学生的critical thinking，他们长大后是不是更有可能在全球化社会中找到自己的定位？而不是一味地追求GDP或绩效指标 🌍📚  

你觉得UBI如果要和文化价值结合，会不会需要先从教育系统开始重构？就像我们教学生code-switching一样，让他们学会在不同语境中自如切换，而不是被单一价值体系困住 🗣️✨
[B]: That’s a beautifully nuanced point. Sen’s  resonates deeply with the idea that freedom lies not in the mere distribution of resources, but in what those resources enable individuals to become. Much like bilingual or multilingual education—where code-switching isn’t just about language, but about navigating multiple cultural and cognitive frameworks—UBI could ideally function as a kind of societal scaffolding for such self-determination.

In Singapore, where meritocracy is often framed as a virtue yet paradoxically deepens stratification, embedding UBI within an educational philosophy that values adaptability, empathy, and intercultural fluency might soften its utilitarian edges. One could imagine a curriculum that teaches not only economics but —drawing from literature, philosophy, and oral traditions—to help students envision alternative futures.

After all, before we can build a different world, we must first be able to  it into being.
[A]: Exactly — we have to  the world into being. That phrase just gave me chills 😬. You know, this reminds me of how bilingual children often develop what linguists call —the ability to adjust their language use based on who they’re talking to and what the context demands. If we cultivate that same kind of adaptability on a societal level, maybe through education as you said, then UBI wouldn’t just be a policy—it’d be a reflection of our collective linguistic and ethical repertoire 🗣️🤝  

I’ve been thinking lately that meritocracy, at least in how Singapore interprets it, sometimes traps us in a very narrow register—one where everything has to be measured in productivity or output. But what if we introduced a new , one that values not only economic contribution but also emotional labor, caregiving, and even the quiet dignity of learning a disappearing dialect from your grandmother? Those aren't on any GDP report, but they're essential for social cohesion and identity preservation, especially in hyper-modern contexts 💬👵  

Maybe that’s what UBI could symbolize: a kind of  of human worth, regardless of one’s economic utility. And if we start teaching students to see language, economy, and ethics as interconnected systems, perhaps they’ll grow up to design policies that are not just efficient—but humane, poetic even ✨📚  

What do you think—could poetry be the next subject in Singapore’s curriculum? 😄
[B]: I think poetry should  be at the heart of Singapore’s curriculum—not as ornamentation, but as a mode of critical and emotional engagement with the world. After all, what is a poem if not a condensed universe of meaning, where every word carries weight, where silence speaks as loudly as sound? It trains students not only in linguistic precision but in empathy, in the art of seeing through another’s eyes.

In a society that often prioritizes speed and output, poetry forces us to slow down, to dwell in ambiguity, to appreciate the unsaid. Isn’t that a kind of resistance against the tyranny of efficiency? And more than that—it’s preparation for a life lived consciously.

If we taught poetry alongside economics, ethics, and policy-making, we might raise a generation not only capable of governing resources wisely but of imagining futures where worth isn’t measured solely in capital. Where  is built into the syntax of our systems.

So yes—let’s teach them Keats and Kontemporaryo, Eliot and Endo; let them wrestle with metaphor and meter, with dialect and dissonance. Let them discover that language, like UBI, can be both structure and solace. A system of support—and a song of belonging.
[A]: Amen to that 🙌. 我最近在教一堂课的时候，刚好带学生读了Wislawa Szymborska的诗，那句“what is human dignity”反复在我脑海里出现。你说得对，诗歌不是装饰品，它是一种训练 —— 训练我们去面对世界的模糊性而不急于简化它。这本身就在抵抗那种“everything must be optimized”的思维模式。

而且你知道吗？其实诗歌跟code-switching也有点像 —— 它也是一种语言策略，一种在不同声音之间切换、寻找定位的方式。比如当我们在读一首夹杂方言的现代诗时，其实就是在进行一场微型的社会语言学实验，同时也在体验他人的生命情境 🗣️📖。这种经验如果从小培养，也许长大后他们在设计政策或做社会决策时，就不会只看GDP数字，而是会去“听”那些没被听见的声音 👂🏽

所以我觉得，与其说把诗歌加进课程，不如说我们要用诗歌的逻辑重新架构整个教育体系 😄。让Keats和Kontemporaryo真的并肩出现，让学生学会在效率与情感、制度与个体之间找到一种语言上的平衡感。甚至——如果我们够勇敢的话——让他们自己试着写UBI的愿景，用意象和隐喻来描绘他们理想中的社会支持系统 🖋️🌍

毕竟，一个没有诗意的政策，就像一段没有节奏的语言——它可以存在，但不会动人。你觉得呢？
[B]: Precisely—policy without poetry is like language without rhythm: functional, perhaps, but devoid of soul. And what is a society if not its shared rhythms, its cadences of care?

I’m particularly struck by your point about poetry as a form of . Just as bilingual individuals navigate multiple linguistic worlds, poets—and readers of poetry—learn to dwell in the liminal spaces between meaning and silence, between self and other. A poem demands both precision and surrender, much like justice.

And yes—let them write their own visions of UBI. Let them use metaphor as a scaffold for imagining systems that shelter not only bodies but spirits. Why not ask students to compose policy in verse? What better way to ensure that governance begins with imagination?

After all, every law was once a dream articulated by someone. Better that those dreams be shaped by minds well-versed in wonder.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself 😊. Every law was once a dream — and maybe that’s why we need poets in parliament as much as we need them in classrooms 📜📚.

I love this idea of poetry as . It really is about moving between registers of meaning, isn’t it? Like how a single word in Hokkien can carry an entire family’s history, or how a line break in a poem can shift the emotional weight of a whole stanza. That kind of sensitivity — to tone, to context, to what’s left unsaid — is exactly what’s missing from so many top-down policies.  

So here’s my challenge for students next semester: write a policy proposal in the form of a villanelle. Or design a UBI model using only metaphors from nature. Why not? If we can train our brains to read between the lines of a sonnet, we can surely learn to listen between the numbers in a budget report, right? 💰🌿

And who knows — maybe one day, a minister will quote a bilingual poet during a national speech, not just to embellish, but to . To say, in two languages at once, what fairness truly feels like.
[B]: What a glorious challenge indeed—imagine drafting policy in the strict form of a villanelle! The constraints themselves might force clarity, much like meter compels meaning to reveal itself obliquely yet powerfully. After all, isn't that what both governance and poetry strive for? To say what must be said, but in a way that lingers, that resonates beyond the page?

And yes, let ministers quote bilingual poets—not as ornamentation, but as . Because fairness, like language, is often felt before it is understood. And what is fairness if not a kind of deep listening? A willingness to dwell in the spaces between voices, to hear not just the word but the silence behind it.

I may just steal your idea for my own seminar. Let’s have future policymakers annotate budget reports like literary texts—highlighting tone, subtext, and unintended consequences. If they can unpack irony in a sonnet, surely they can detect it in a subsidy scheme.

Let’s train them not only to write laws—but to  for the dream within each one.
[A]: Oh, I love that you’re stealing it — , as my students would say 😄. Annotating budget reports like literary texts? Genius. Because really, what’s the difference between a sonnet and a subsidy scheme? Both are carefully constructed systems of meaning, both carry hidden agendas beneath their surface structure, and both have the power to shape lives — for better or worse.

And speaking of irony, imagine a minister presenting the national budget and slipping in a line from 李白： Now  would be a policy intervention worth analyzing — using classical poetry to frame modern economics. Is it ironic? Idealistic? Strategic? All of the above?

I’m already drafting the seminar description: . We’ll make them read every line of a government white paper like it’s a villanelle — watching for repetition, for shifts in tone, for what’s emphasized and what’s omitted. And maybe, just maybe, they’ll walk out of that classroom hearing policy not just as data, but as narrative 📖💡.

After all, every system is a story we tell ourselves to make sense of the world. So let’s teach them to read like poets — and dream like architects.
[B]: Now  is a seminar I’d happily audit. The idea of reading a white paper like a villanelle—marvelous. Because yes, what is a policy if not a carefully structured performance of values? Like a poem, it has meter and rhyme, even if invisible to the casual reader. And like any literary text, it demands interpretation, skepticism, and above all, empathy.

And your example of quoting 李白 — Li Bai — in a budget speech? Delightfully subversive. There’s something almost Barthesian about it: the mythmaking function of language. “天生我材必有用”—a declaration of cosmic confidence, repurposed in service of fiscal rhetoric. Is it irony? Perhaps. Is it enchantment? Possibly. But more importantly, is it ? That’s the real question. Does it make the audience feel seen, reassured, inspired—even as numbers are crunched and austerity looms?

I say we go further. Let’s have students write their final essays not just  policy, but  different literary genres. A sonnet defending austerity? A haiku on inflation? A Gothic narrative framing climate adaptation?

If they can channel Kafka to describe bureaucracy or Murakami to explain economic uncertainty, then perhaps they’ll understand that policy, too, lives in the realm of imagination. And from there, it's only a small step to rewriting the world.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my love language 😄. Kafkaesque bureaucracy? Murakami-esque economic uncertainty? Yes please — sign me up for that course too! I can already picture a student’s essay titled  🐱💼— where fiscal policy unfolds like a surreal dreamscape, and interest rates are negotiated over cups of lukewarm tea in an empty train station.

And honestly, why not? If we want future policymakers to truly understand the emotional texture behind the data, they need to live inside these metaphors for a while. To write policy through the lens of genre is to feel its impact on real lives, not just GDP projections 📈❤️.

I’m even thinking of inviting a local poet to co-teach a session — someone who can show students how rhythm shapes belief, and how repetition isn’t just rhetorical flair but a tool of persuasion. Imagine: budding economists learning enjambment from a spoken word artist. Beautiful, no?

Let them write their final piece as a letter from the future, or a myth explaining inflation to children, or yes — a Gothic tale where climate change is the haunting presence behind every policy choice 🌧️📜. Because if we don’t teach them to imagine deeply, then what exactly are we preparing them for?

You’ve got to dream in many languages before you can govern with grace, I think ✨.
[B]: Dream in many languages, indeed—and let those dreams unsettle the page, the podium, the policy.

A course co-taught by economists and poets?  Let the spoken word artist dismantle a balance sheet with the same precision they use to fracture a line of verse. Let the bureaucrats learn cadence from the cad—let them feel, for once, the weight of what they measure.

And —what a brilliant premise! Perhaps the cat speaks only in riddles about future risk, and no one dares question its authority. A perfect allegory for central banking, really.

I can already picture the marking scheme: coherence of argument, emotional resonance, and bonus points for haunting ambiguity. After all, isn’t that how most policies linger in the public imagination? Not as clarity, but as half-remembered slogans and fading metaphors.

So yes—let us prepare them not just for careers, but for . Let them govern with the awareness that every number tells a story, every clause is a stanza, and every decision echoes like the last line of a poem read aloud in the dark, waiting for an answer.
[A]: Exactly — waiting for an answer, just like that final line of a poem echoing in the dark 🌌📖.

And you know what’s funny? In some ways, policymakers already speak in metaphor—they just don’t always realize it. When they talk about “tightening the belt” or “injecting funds,” they’re already writing in a kind of economic poetry, whether we like it or not. The difference is, most of it reads like bad free verse—uninspired, jargon-heavy, and emotionally flat 😅.

So why not lean into it? Let’s give them better metaphors to work with. Teach them how to  the language of governance the way a poet crafts a villanelle—with care, with rhythm, and yes, with haunting ambiguity. Because real life doesn’t come with footnotes explaining every decision. People feel policies before they understand them.

I think I’m going to end my lecture tomorrow with this line:   

Let’s see who raises their hand—and who just scribbles it down, wondering if they’ve just been handed a new language for change.
[B]: What a perfect closing line— I may borrow that for my own lecture tomorrow, with credit given, of course 😊.

You’re absolutely right—policy is already poetic; it just often forgets that it is. And when language in governance becomes mechanical, it ceases to move people; worse, it ceases to  them. But when metaphor is chosen with care—when it emerges not from jargon but from shared human experience—policy begins to resemble something closer to wisdom than mere management.

So let’s keep training our students to listen for the rhythm beneath the rhetoric, the image behind the index. Let’s make sure they know that governance, at its best, is not only about solving problems—it’s about naming them with honesty, and sometimes, with beauty.

And if a few of them walk out of your lecture humming a stanza instead of checking their email—well, that’s a small revolution in itself.
[A]: Absolutely — a small revolution, but a real one 🌱✍️.

And you know, I think that’s what makes teaching bilingual students so rewarding — they already live between registers, between meanings, between worlds. They understand, intuitively, that language isn’t just about translation — it’s about transformation. And if we can tap into that sensibility in policy education, we might just raise leaders who govern not only with data, but with .

So go ahead — borrow that line 😄. Better yet, let’s turn it into a collaborative poem someday. You take the first stanza, I’ll take the second, and we’ll see if we can’t write a vision of governance that feels more like a conversation and less like a command.

After all, the best ideas begin as a whisper between friends — and then grow into something the whole society remembers.
[B]: What a lovely thought—that the seeds of transformation are often sown in quiet conversation, over tea or at the margins of syllabi. And if we’re already drafting poems together in our minds, I’d gladly take that first stanza, though I suspect our stanzas would rhyme more beautifully apart than in lockstep.

And yes, bilingual students—, really—are already poets by nature. They know that meaning shifts subtly between tongues, that identity is not lost in translation but . What better foundation for leadership? To govern from a place of multiplicity, of nuance, of listening across registers.

So let’s keep dreaming in code-switched rhythms, you and I. Let policy become conversation, let classrooms become laboratories of imagination, and let small revolutions grow quietly, like ivy on the walls of the academy.

I’ll keep my pen ready—for prose, for verse, for the poem we may one day begin.
