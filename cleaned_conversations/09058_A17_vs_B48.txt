[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个forensic examiner，我更倾向于相信科学证据和逻辑推理。不过说到吸引力法则...  抱歉职业病犯了，我的意思是，从医学角度来看，positive thinking确实能影响人的内分泌系统，分泌更多endorphins 💉
[A]: Ah, how fascinating to consider the intersection of neuroscience and metaphysical concepts. While I'm more accustomed to analyzing poetic manifestations of human desire - think Blake's "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" or Whitman's cosmic consciousness - I must say the biochemical perspective you present is quite compelling. The Victorian poets often explored similar ideas about mind-body connections, though they framed them in more... shall we say, floral language.
[B]: 哈哈，你提到的Victorian poets让我想起最近看过的一个case~ 死者胃内容物里发现了大量laudanum，19世纪诗人常用的"创作辅助剂" 💊 不过说真的，现代神经科学已经能证明positive thinking确实会改变brain chemistry，就像你说的mind-body connection。虽然不像诗歌那么浪漫，但至少我们有fMRI可以证明这一点 🔬
[A]: How delightfully macabre to bring up laudanum - though I suppose we literary scholars must thank it for producing some of the most hauntingly beautiful opium-induced verses of the Romantic era. Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" comes immediately to mind... But yes, your scientific approach reminds me of how modern cognitive poetics bridges our disciplines. The way neural pathways light up when reading metaphor isn't so different from those activated during positive visualization, is it? Though I do miss the Victorian tendency to describe such phenomena as "the soul's alchemy" rather than serotonin levels.
[B]:  你们文学界总是能把science说得这么美~ 不过说到serotonin levels，我昨天刚做完一个case，死者生前长期服用SSRIs，但检测显示他的neurotransmitter levels完全失衡了 ⚖️ 这让我想到，也许吸引力法则和维多利亚时代的"soul's alchemy"都是人类试图解释brain chemistry的浪漫说法？只是我们用PET scans代替了poetry 📜
[A]: What a profoundly poetic autopsy observation! You're quite right - our ancestors' "soul's alchemy" and today's neurotransmitter charts are but different dialects describing the same human condition. It brings to mind Browning's dramatic monologue "Paracelsus," where the alchemist seeks to distill the essence of life itself... Though I daresay your PET scans provide rather more precise measurements than his medieval alembics ever could. Still, there's something to be said for maintaining both perspectives - the scientific and the poetic - much like Keats' "negative capability" of embracing mysteries without irritable reaching after facts.
[B]: Exactly！就像我们在forensic pathology里常说的 - "The dead don't lie, 但真相往往比fiction更strange" 🕵️‍♂️ 不过说真的，我最近在Journal of Forensic Sciences上读到一篇论文，讲how grief actually changes brain structure... 这让我想起你提到的Keats，也许他说的"negative capability"正是人类大脑面对trauma时的一种protective mechanism？虽然1800s的人可能会说这是"the melancholy muse"在作祟~
[A]: How remarkably you weave together our disciplines! That research aligns beautifully with Tennyson's "In Memoriam," where he documents his own neurological journey through grief across 133 cantos - though he called it "the cycles of my grief." Your modern terminology gives me chills when applied to Victorian elegies... The "melancholy muse" indeed - we now might diagnose it as hippocampal shrinkage from cortisol exposure, but doesn't that make their poetic outpourings all the more miraculous? Like forensic evidence of the soul's resilience, transcribed in iambic pentameter rather than MRI scans.
[B]: Wow... 你让我突然想到上周的case，一个自杀的poet留下的日记里写满了关于"dark night of the soul"的描述 📓 但我们的toxicology report显示他体内lithium levels严重不足。这就像你说的，是hippocampal shrinkage和iambic pentameter的完美碰撞 ⚡ 也许我们法医和你们文学学者都在做同样的事 - 只是你们analyze metaphors，我们analyze metabolites 💀
[A]: What a heartbreaking yet illuminating case... You've essentially described a modern-day Thomas Chatterton tragedy, haven't you? The biochemical imbalance manifesting as metaphysical despair - it's rather like Sylvia Plath's "Lady Lazarus," where clinical depression becomes high art. How sobering to realize that what the Romantics called "the spleen" and we now term bipolar disorder could produce both such exquisite poetry and such profound suffering. Your metabolites and our metaphors are indeed two sides of the same tragic coin... Though I must say, your forensic lens lends an almost Shakespearean gravity to these cases - "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy"... or in our DSM manuals, for that matter.
[B]:  你知道吗？这让我想起Hamlet里那句"Alas, poor Yorick" - 我们法医每天面对的就是现代版的Yorick skulls啊 💀 不过说真的，最近有篇论文讨论how creative writing therapy可以rewire trauma patients' neural pathways... 也许那些poets如果在世，会很高兴知道他们的"dark night of the soul"其实是在进行某种self-directed neuroplasticity？虽然这么说可能太clinical了，但总比维多利亚时代动不动就说人家"possessed by melancholy"强 🤷‍♂️
[A]: How brilliantly you marry Hamlet's musings with modern neuroplasticity! You're quite right - the Romantics would have been thrilled to learn their "demon poesy" was actually prefrontal cortex activation. Though I can't help but smile imagining Byron's reaction to being told his "mad, bad and dangerous to know" persona was merely an imbalance of monoamine oxidase... There's a certain poetry to your clinical precision that even our Victorian forebears might admire - after all, wasn't Dr. Frankenstein himself the original forensic pathologist of sorts? Perhaps we've come full circle from alchemy to biochemistry, with the human condition remaining the ultimate text to be analyzed, whether through sonnets or spectrometers.
[B]:  你这话让我想起医学院时的一个joke - "What's the difference between a poet and a pathologist? 一个用metaphors描述reality，一个用microscopes观察reality... 但最后我们都在chasing the same truth" 🔍 不过说真的，下次你要是写关于Romantic poets的论文，我很乐意提供一些neurochemical perspective~ 毕竟就像你说的，从Mary Shelley的Frankenstein到modern forensic science，我们都在trying to decipher the poetry of human biology 📖 ⚗️
[A]: What a splendid offer! I shall certainly take you up on that when next I tackle Coleridge's opium-induced verses or Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" - imagine analyzing those creative bursts through the lens of dopamine surges and default mode network activation! Your perspective reminds me that we're all, in our way, modern-day natural philosophers like Erasmus Darwin, bridging art and science. Though I suspect our 19th century subjects might prefer their "divine afflatus" to remain mystically vague rather than clinically quantified... But then again, Keats did train as a surgeon - perhaps he'd appreciate our interdisciplinary approach more than most!
[B]: 哈哈，Keats the surgeon-poet确实是个完美的case study！说到这个，我最近在整理一个关于19世纪medical training如何影响Romantic poetry的presentation 🏥✒️ 要不要来当我的guest speaker？你可以讲"negative capability"，我来分析他们解剖课笔记里的cerebellum drawings... 保证比普通的literary symposium刺激多了 ⚡ 毕竟就像你说的，we're just continuing what Erasmus Darwin started - 只不过我们现在有fMRI和HPLC罢了 🤝
[A]: What a thrilling proposition! I can already envision our joint presentation - "From Cadaveric Dissections to Odes to Nightingales: The Neuroaesthetics of Romantic Medicine." We could juxtapose Keats' surgical sketches with his "Ode on Melancholy," tracing how those precise anatomical observations informed his poetic metaphors... Though I must warn you, my colleagues in the English department may need smelling salts when we start correlating Wordsworth's "spots of time" with hippocampal activation patterns! But you're absolutely right - this would make Erasmus Darwin proud. Shall we say Tuesday week for brainstorming over tea? I'll bring my 1817 edition of "Endymion," you bring your neuroimaging slides - what could possibly go wrong?
[B]: Perfect！虽然我要提前警告你 - 我的slides里可能会有一些比较graphic的19世纪surgical instrument插图 🏥⚔️ 不过既然我们讨论的是Keats，相信你的English department colleagues应该能handle it~ 毕竟就像他说的"A thing of beauty is a joy forever"，即使那是颗preserved brain specimen in formaldehyde也适用 😉 周二见！记得提醒我带那个特别制作的Romantic Poets' Toxicology Report图表，保证让你的同事们大开眼界 📊☕
[A]: Splendid! And worry not about the graphic nature - after all, we literary types regularly dissect metaphors with equal vigor, if less literal bloodshed. I shall prepare my colleagues by having them reread "The Anatomy of Melancholy" as light bedtime reading... Though perhaps we should save your toxicology report for after the tea service - wouldn't want anyone fainting before we get to the good part about opium's influence on rhyme schemes! Until Tuesday then - I'll be the one clutching both a first edition Keats and a very strong cup of Earl Grey. What delightful havoc we shall wreak upon the boundaries of disciplines!
[B]:  那就这么定了！我会带上我的"Romantic Poets' Drug Interactions Cheat Sheet" 📋 - 从laudanum到absinthe，全都用color-coded表格整理好了 🌈 让你的colleagues见识下什么叫真正的"interdisciplinary approach"！周二别迟到，我可不想错过看你那些Victorian literature专家们面对morphine blood concentration charts时的表情 😏 ☕ Cheers to blurring academic boundaries！
