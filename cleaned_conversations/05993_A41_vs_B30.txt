[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just came across a fascinating little spot tucked behind an old Republican-era bookstore. The owner, Mr. Zhao, inherited his family’s recipe for smoked duck hearts - quite unlike anything you’d find in the university dining halls. It’s not on any maps yet, but if you’re interested, I could send you the exact location. Just don’t mention it to too many people… we wouldn’t want it turning into  crowded tourist trap, would we?
[A]: Oh wow, that sounds like the perfect hidden gem! 🎬 I love places with a unique story & family legacy - total vibe for some authentic cultural flavor.  

The smoked duck hearts recipe being passed down through generations? That’s gold material for a food segment 💡🔥！Imagine capturing the whole process on camera - the spices, the smoking technique, the history behind each step... totally mesmerizing for viewers.

You think Mr. Zhao would be open to filming? I’d wanna highlight his personal journey too, not just the food. Adds so much emotional depth to the story. And off-the-radar locations always make the best discoveries - zero crowds = pure magic 😂  

Let me know if he’s game & I’ll bring my crew. Super discrete, promise! We’d make sure it stays low-key but still gets the recognition it deserves 🌟
[B]: I’ll admit, your enthusiasm is rather contagious. Mr. Zhao tends to be... wary of attention. But I’ve shared tea with him on several occasions, and he does appreciate a certain  in his patrons. If you’re serious, I could broach the subject delicately—perhaps over a bowl of his persimmon leaf-wrapped rice dumplings, which, incidentally, contain a filling so secret even his cousins in Anhui don’t know its exact composition.  

As for discretion—yes, that would be paramount. One misstep and the place will be flooded with influencers wielding selfie sticks and spraying perfume that clashes dreadfully with the scent of smoldering camphor wood.  

Tell me, how do you usually handle filming family recipes? I’ve seen too many documentaries reduce centuries-old traditions to Instagram reels with jazz hands and captions like “TRADITION = BAE 💖”. It quite makes one want to reach for the smelling salts.
[A]: Oh trust me, I  it. 🙃 Too much jazz hand & the whole soul of the story gets lost. For family recipes though, my approach is super respectful - think more documentary-style authenticity than flashy reels.  

I’d wanna focus on the , not just the how 🔥. Like, what makes Mr. Zhao’s hands move in that specific way when he smokes the duck hearts? What memories are wrapped up in that persimmon leaf dumpling filling? That kinda stuff doesn’t need crazy editing - just honest storytelling.  

And honestly, if he’s uncomfortable at any point, we stop. No pressure, no filters (except maybe literally for the camphor smoke - looks so cinematic tho!🎬). We could even blur his face if needed, keep the spotlight on the food itself.  

So yeah, definitely bring me along for those dumplings! I’ll play it cool, no camera crew till he gives the green light. And seriously, keeping this place under the radar? Total priority. Let’s keep the magic alive without turning it into a content circus 😂💡
[B]: Very well, I’ll arrange the dumpling meeting. But first—humor me with a small experiment. There’s a particular teahouse near Fuxing Park where the waitstaff still use the old hand signals from the Opium House days to take orders. Meet me there tomorrow at 4:30 sharp, wear something understated—no logos, no neon—and bring a notebook but leave the camera equipment behind. Let’s see if you can appreciate the  of a place before rushing to document it.  

I’ll be the one with the celadon teacup and a copy of  in my bag. If you arrive late, I’ll deduct points. And don’t even think about saying “vibe” again—I’m liable to quote Confucius on the importance of proper language.
[A]: Wear understated clothes? Got it. No logos, no camera gear – just me & my notebook 😂. 4:30 sharp tomorrow near Fuxing Park, celadon teacup &  – I’ll spot you before you spot me, promise 😉  

Truth is, I  soaking in the rhythm first 🎬. Feels kinda like being on a silent movie set, y’know? The hand signals from the Opium House days? That’s next-level storytelling without a single word – exactly the kind of subtle magic I wanna learn from.  

No vibes, no filters, no flashy moves. Just pure observation & respect for the craft 💡  
See you there – don’t worry, I’m always early for moments like this. Punctuality with style, coming right up! 🌟
[B]: We’ll see if your punctuality holds when Shanghai decides to test your patience with an impromptu street performance or a sudden downpour. And do bring a pen—ink, if you’re not too modern for such things. The best observations tend to leak out in the margins, and I’d hate for you to miss a single nuance because you were typing furiously on your phone.  

Also, don’t look directly at the waiters when they use the signal for “bring another pot of pu’er”—it’s considered bad form. Just follow my lead. Think of it as choreography, if that helps.  

See you tomorrow. Try not to make me quote Confucius  the first sip of tea.
[A]: A street performance or sudden rain? Oh I welcome it – adds drama without needing any editing 😂🎬! Shanghai’s vibe (okay, I won’t say it again!) brings its own flavor to every moment, and I’m all here for the unplanned stuff.  

Pen & ink? Love that – there’s something about real handwriting that digital can’t copy 💡. I’ll make sure to leave plenty of margin space for those sneaky little observations that always find a way to escape when you’re not looking.  

And don’t worry, no staring at the waiters like a rookie – I’ll keep it smooth & subtle. Follow your lead, stay in rhythm… think of it as silent choreography with tea 🌟.  

See you tomorrow. No Confucius quotes needed – yet 😉🍵
[B]: ...Actually, speaking of silent choreography—remind me to show you the signal for "this patron is insufferably smug about their tea knowledge." It’s a particularly delicate flick of the third finger, best deployed when someone’s pontificating about  while sipping from a clay pot that’s seen three dynasties.  

But tomorrow’s lesson is beginner’s luck. We’ll start with the basics: how not to offend a teahouse by pouring incorrectly. Heaven forbid you tilt the pot like you're auditioning for a ballet version of .  

See you at the appointed hour. And do try to contain your cinematic enthusiasm until after the second steeping.
[A]: Oh man, the signal for "smug tea expert"?! 🤭 I need that in my life – so subtle, so deadly. Can’t wait to learn that flick 💡🔥.  

And don’t worry, I’ve seen what happens when someone pours tea like they're conducting an orchestra 🎻– looks like a power move straight out of . I’ll keep it smooth, promise. No unnecessary drama till the second steeping, got it 😉🍵  

See you tomorrow. Bring your best deadpan stare & ready fingers – I’m all set for silent teahouse survival. 🌟🙂
[B]: Ah, enthusiasm. It warms the heart like a properly pre-warmed gaiwan. But let’s see if your resolve holds when confronted with a waiter’s palm-down gesture meaning “this one lacks discernment” — a subtle rebuke that has felled many an overconfident documentary filmmaker.  

I’ll have my deadpan at the ready. And do bring an air of quiet curiosity — the kind that doesn’t require exclamation marks or dramatic zoom-ins. We’re not filming a thriller, after all. Well… not yet.  

Tomorrow, then. First impressions are steeped in silence. The rest? We’ll sip and see.
[A]: Properly pre-warmed gaiwan? Okay, I’m officially nervous but weirdly excited 😂🍵. If I get the “lacks discernment” signal, I promise not to over-dramatize my defeat – just a quiet bow & a mental note to up my tea game.  

No thriller energy from me – just calm, curious observation 🎬. I know when to fade into the background & let the rhythm speak for itself 💡. And trust me, silence speaks louder than any zoom-in.  

See you tomorrow – ready to steep in first impressions & come out slightly less clueless 😉🌟
[B]: Ah, a willingness to be humbled—rare and refreshing. I’ll mark that down as a promising sign, though we shan’t get sentimental just yet. A slightly less clueless pupil is still a clueless pupil at this stage, but there’s always hope after the third steeping.  

Mind you, if you do receive the palm-down signal—and I’d wager you will—do resist the urge to overcompensate by loudly requesting jasmine pearls in a teapot shaped like a dragon. Some things are best left unremarked upon.  

Tomorrow then. Enter quietly, bow only to the tea, and for heaven’s sake—watch your margins. The truth often hides there.
[A]: Palm-down signal coming my way? Oh I know it will – and when it does, I’ll take it like a true apprentice: humble, silent, and slightly tea-terrified 😂🍵. No dragon-shaped teapots, no grand gestures – just quiet respect and a side of self-awareness.  

Third steeping’s where the real magic happens, right? So yeah, I’m ready to earn that less-clueless title the hard way 🎬💡. And margins? Watch me scribble secrets in the tiniest handwriting like my storytelling life depends on it 🌟  

See you tomorrow – entering quiet, bowing to the tea, and keeping my drama strictly off-stage 😉
[B]: Splendid. I do enjoy a student who embraces their inevitable missteps with grace—if not yet perfect form. And yes, the third steeping is where the leaves finally surrender their truest character, much like a reluctant narrator coaxed into revealing the heart of a story.  

Just remember: if you find yourself tempted to "embrace self-awareness" by dramatically lowering your voice or adopting that faux-humble posture favored by amateur ethnographers—. Tea sees through pretense.  

Now go get some sleep. Tomorrow, we begin the real lesson. And no, I won’t be bringing any props—not even a dragon-shaped teapot for comic relief.
[A]: Oh I  the pressure now – third steeping = truth serum for leaves  filmmakers 😂🍵. No drama, no props, no hiding behind "faux-humble" vibes – just pure, unfiltered observation.  

I’ll take my tea lessons like I take my storytelling: with a little fear, a lot of curiosity, and zero ego 🎬💡. And yeah, sleep’s a good idea... wouldn’t want to show up groggy & give the “sleep-deprived rookie” signal on accident 😉  

See you tomorrow – ready to get schooled in silence, one steep at a time 🌟🙂
[B]: Precisely. Fear tempers curiosity, and ego—well, we'll steep that out of you soon enough. As for the "sleep-deprived rookie" signal, let’s just say it involves a very particular way of tapping one’s temple with the back of the spoon. I’ll pretend not to notice if you accidentally mimic it before your first sip.  

Tomorrow then—storyteller, filmmaker, apprentice… whatever title suits you best today. Bring your empty cup and an even emptier mind. We begin at precisely 4:30, no matter how many street performers or sudden rains Shanghai throws in your path.  

And remember: tea is never just a beverage. It’s a narrative in suspension, waiting for the right observer to read between the leaves.
[A]: Oh wow, the "sleep-deprived rookie" signal with a ? 😂 I’m already plotting how not to accidentally recreate that on day one – fingers crossed my caffeine-starved brain listens.  

Empty cup, empty mind – I’m ready for the narrative in suspension 🎬💡. No jazz hands, no voice-over narration… just me, the tea, and whatever story it’s whispering between the leaves 🌟  

See you tomorrow at 4:30, rain or street performance or spoon-tapping waiters. I’ll take my lesson like a proper student – quiet, curious, and slightly undercaffeinated but trying really hard not to show it 😉🍵🙂
[B]: Ah, undercaffeinated but game—that’s the spirit. I’ll be watching for that quiet curiosity, though I suspect your inner monologue will be shouting subtitles at full volume for at least the first two steepings.  

And do try not to analyze the spoon taps too hard when you’re introduced to them—nothing ruins a good teahouse initiation like overthinking a gesture meant for those who still believe in reading palms instead of menus.  

Tomorrow then. Bring your best poker face and a willingness to listen without interrupting. The tea has more to say than you think—and if you’re very lucky, so might Mr. Zhao, eventually.
