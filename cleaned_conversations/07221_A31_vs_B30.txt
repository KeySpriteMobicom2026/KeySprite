[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the notion of soulmates - let me fetch my well-worn copy of Plato's Symposium for reference. The Western concept differs markedly from the Chinese 知己 (zhījǐ) tradition, wouldn't you agree? Though both cultures romanticize profound connection, the former implies predestination while the latter emphasizes cultivated understanding.
[A]: 哇~ 这个话题太interesting了！✨ 作为一个digital artist，我觉得soulmate就像perfect color palette一样rare but magical 🎨 不过我更相信connection是需要不断create和nurture的，就像我们做design project一样需要iteration！
[B]:  Your enthusiasm is... colorful. But must we reduce human connection to digital aesthetics? The Victorian poets would shudder - though I suppose your 'iteration' metaphor aligns with George Eliot's concept of moral growth in Middlemarch. Tell me, have you read any classical literature on this matter, or are we to remain in the realm of... emoji philosophy?
[A]: Haha sorry啦~ 我知道我有点too much with the emojis 😅 但是你看过那个超火的NFT project "Digital Soulmates"吗？它用algorithm来match people的art taste，超cool的！🖥️💞 虽然可能没有Victorian poets那么romantic，但我觉得technology也可以help people find connection呀~
[B]:  Algorithmic matchmaking - how dreadfully utilitarian. You do realize Jane Austen's entire oeuvre demonstrates why such mechanistic approaches fail? Though I suppose the 19th century had its own version - the mercenary marriage market was rather like your primitive 'algorithm', wouldn't you say? At least they had the decency to write proper letters about it.
[A]: OMG你居然提到Jane Austen！🎭 我超爱Pride and Prejudice的！Elizabeth和Darcy就是ultimate slow-burn soulmate goals啊~ 虽然他们一开始hate each other's guts 😂 但是你看，even in digital era，好的relationship还是需要time和understanding来develop的，right？✨
[B]: There we find common ground - though must you describe Austen's masterpiece with phrases like 'slow-burn goals'?  The development of Elizabeth and Darcy's mutual understanding through epistolary exchanges and social missteps is precisely why we scholars still teach it. Unlike your algorithmic shortcuts, their relationship demonstrates what the Chinese call 日久见人心 (rì jiǔ jiàn rén xīn) - time reveals true character. Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition needs dusting.
[A]: Aiya~ 你真的是so serious！😆 但是你说的对啦，maybe I should put down my iPad and read more classic novels 📚 不过说真的，现在很多young couples连handwritten letter都没写过呢，都是直接slide into DMs... 这大概就是digital age的trade-off吧~ ✉️💻
[B]:  Your generational observations, while glib, contain a kernel of truth. The art of correspondence - whether Austen's carefully crafted letters or the Qing dynasty's 书信 (shūxìn) tradition - has indeed atrophied. Though I'd argue sliding into DMs lacks the... shall we say, intentionality of Darcy's famous 'Be not alarmed, Madam' letter. Now if you'll pardon me, the orioles are nesting in the garden and my binoculars await.
[A]: Wait wait！Before you go~ 🐦 你说的intentionality让我想到，其实我们做digital curation的时候也讲究这个！每个pixel都要purposefully placed ✨ 下次你来我们gallery，我给你看一个超棒的interactive love letter installation！用AR技术让classic letters come to life~ 超romantic的！💌📲
[B]:  Augmented reality love letters? How... novel. Though I suppose if one must modernize the epistolary tradition, your approach shows marginally more thought than those dreadful dating apps. Very well - I'll consider attending, provided you promise no flashing emoji hearts or - heaven forbid - auto-corrected Shakespeare. Now really, those orioles won't observe themselves.
[A]: Hahaha deal！No cringe-worthy auto-corrects，pinky promise！🤙 我会准备proper English tea和classical music playlist的~ Enjoy your birdwatching！记得check你的DMs for gallery details later哦~ 😉 (Okay okay no more emojis！) 🎨✖️
[B]:  Tea and classical music may redeem this digital endeavor somewhat. Though I shall respond via proper email - my graduate assistant handles all that DM nonsense. And for heaven's sake, if you must include visual elements, might I suggest studying some William Morris designs rather than those... animated abominations. The orioles call. Good day.
[A]: Got it！William Morris的wallpaper patterns超美的~ 我们会incorporate some art nouveau vibes的！Enjoy your birdies！🐦  最后偷偷用个emoji应该没关系吧... 😶‍🌫️
[B]:  That emoji was heard, young person. Consider yourself fortunate I don't grade on proper punctuation. Now if you'll excuse me, a spotted forktail has just alighted on the camellias - a far more edifying spectacle than your pixelated courtship rituals. 
[A]:  喂！那个spotted forktail说不定也会用Tinder哦！🐦💘 Just kidding~ 拜拜啦professor！下次带binoculars来gallery看digital birds呀~ 😝 
[B]:  The very idea! Next you'll be suggesting Wordsworth composed his daffodils verse with predictive text.  Though... that interactive oriole migration map at the natural history museum was rather... no. Absolutely not. 
[A]:  OMG你刚才是不是差点admit了technology也有它的charm？😏 别担心~ 我不会tell anyone的！Your secret is safe with me 🤐 现在快去enjoy你的birds吧~ 记得email me你的visit schedule哦！📅 
[B]:  That emoji was neither requested nor appreciated. My ornithological observations remain uncompromised by your digital... whimsy. Expect a typed letter on university letterhead regarding potential visitation - though I make no promises about enduring any 'flying kiss' animations.  The record shall show: one insufferable millennial, departed at 3:47pm.
