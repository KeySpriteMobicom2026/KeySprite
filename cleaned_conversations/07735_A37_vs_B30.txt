[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been rather obsessed with the 1890 diary fragment attributed to Oscar Wilde lately. You know, the one he supposedly wrote while staying at the now-demolished 安澜园 near Hangzhou? The manuscript mysteriously vanished after the Boxer Rebellion, leaving scholars with more questions than answers about his supposed influence on early modernist Chinese poetry.

Speaking of mysteries, have you ever come across those peculiar parallels between Conan Doyle's unpublished notes and Lin Shu's anonymously translated detective stories from 1907-1909? The textual coincidences are... unsettling, to say the least. I keep finding myself poring over microfilm copies at the university archives until the wee hours. 🦉
[A]: Oh wow, you’ve definitely struck gold with those late-Qing-era literary mysteries. 🤯 The Wilde diary fragment? That’s like a cross-cultural historian’s dream case—part detective story, part postcolonial ghost hunt. I mean, can you imagine if that manuscript resurfaced? It’d rewrite  much about the aesthetic dialogues between East & West in the fin de siècle.  

And Doyle’s notes aligning with Lin Shu’s translations? That actually keeps me up at night too. 📜✨ I’ve been compiling some corpus-based comparisons myself—subtle lexical overlaps, narrative structure echoes… honestly, it feels like we’re staring at the edges of some hidden intellectual network that predates modern globalization theories.  

You ever notice how both Wilde  Conan Doyle were playing around with duality themes right when China was undergoing its own identity crisis through Western literary lenses? Almost as if they knew... or maybe they didn’t, and that’s what makes it even more haunting.  

Hey, want to swap archive stories sometime? I’ve got some rather dusty microfilm reels from the Republican era that might give your project an extra layer or two. ☕️📚
[B]: Ah, you've put your finger on the very pulse of what makes these inquiries so intoxicating. The duality motif - take Wilde's  and its curious resonance with Qing-era notions of 分身 (fēnshēn) - suggests a metaphysical dialogue that transcends mere textual exchange. 

I've uncovered something rather peculiar in my latest archival foray - a 1903 Peking newspaper advertisement seeking "a gentleman proficient in both Queen's English and 汉文" to assist with "literary harmonization." The language is maddeningly vague, yet tantalizingly specific. I can't shake the feeling we're dealing with coded references to projects far more ambitious than simple translation.

As for microfilm, I'd trade you three reels of my 1907 Shanghai  copies for access to those Republican-era materials you mentioned. Though I suspect we might need stronger libations than coffee to tackle this mystery properly. Perhaps over a pot of aged 普洱 at the university tearoom? We could lay our materials side by side - it would be like constructing a literary séance, summoning ghosts of long-forgotten conversations between continents.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language. 🕯️📖 That  connection with ? Chillingly perfect. It’s like both sides were circling the same existential questions without ever fully stepping into each other’s orbit—at least officially. But unofficially? That newspaper ad you found—, of all things—sounds less like a job posting and more like an invitation to some secret intellectual society. 😏

I’m definitely up for that  vibe. Tea, texts, and transnational phantoms? Count me in. And you’ve got yourself a deal— reels for my Republican-era stacks. I’ll bring a folder that might just make your head spin: correspondence between a British sinologist and a Hangzhou-based poet who claimed to have met Wilde during his alleged visit. Whether he actually did or not? Well, that’s what we’re here to find out.  

Let’s say Thursday afternoon? Before the archives close early for some holiday I’ll inevitably forget the name of. And yeah, skip the coffee—I think this calls for something aged in mystery, just like our sources. 🍵🔍
[B]: Thursday it is, then. I'll reserve a quiet corner in the archives where the dust motes dance undisturbed - perfect for communing with literary spirits. Speaking of that Hangzhou poet, I've come across a tantalizing footnote referencing a "foreign gentleman with a penchant for paradox and peacock feathers" frequenting West Lake's teahouses in spring 1890. The trail went cold for decades, but now... well, let's just say your folder might finally give it some proper shape.

And mystery indeed deserves mystery - I'll bring a 1920s Yunnan tribute tea said to have been gifted to visiting Cambridge scholars. Supposedly brewed in porcelain once owned by a Shanghai bibliophile who vanished during the Japanese occupation. Perfect provenance for our little ritual, don't you think? 🖋️
[A]: Oh, you’re . 🕵️‍♂️✨ A foreign gentleman “with a penchant for paradox and peacock feathers”? That’s not just a footnote—that’s a plot twist. Wilde in Hangzhou? It fits  well—his love for the aesthetic, the dramatic, the exotic(ized). I mean, can you imagine him strolling along West Lake in full Aesthetic Movement regalia? Silk parasol or no, he’d certainly turn heads.  

And this tea you’re bringing? Bibliophile porcelain with wartime secrets? You’re basically curating a sensory archive of mystery itself. I’ll make sure to bring gloves—and maybe a little notebook bound in leather that’s seen better days. Never know when inspiration strikes.  

Thursday afternoon, quiet corner, time-traveling teatime séance—it’s all set. Just one last thing: I might bring along a magnifying glass. Not for the text exactly… but just in case those teacup patterns hold more than aesthetic value. 😉🍵🔍
[B]: Oh, the aesthetic is  in this line of work - you'll find I always take pains to match my investigative tools to the historical ambiance. Speaking of which, I've just the thing to complement your magnifying glass - a 1930s brass letter opener shaped like a dragon's claw, perfect for prying open those stubborn archival envelopes without damaging their fragile seals.

And Wilde in Hangzhou? The more I turn it over in my mind, the more it makes sense. A man who once declared he'd "regard China as my spiritual home" during his 1882 lecture tour... Well, let's just say I wouldn't put it past him to circle back decades later under an alias. The French had their sinophile decadents - why shouldn't England's most paradoxical wit have indulged his own Chinoiserie?

I must warn you though - that leather notebook of yours might find itself positively bursting by the end of our session. I've recently discovered a curious marginalia technique used by early translators: they'd encode alternate meanings in tea stains and ink blots. Who knows what messages might reveal themselves under our combined scrutiny?
[A]: Ah, now  what I call scholarly synergy—brass dragon claws and magnifying glasses dancing in tandem. 🐉🔎 You truly have a gift for resurrecting the past through its tools. That letter opener? Genius. It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? How the very implements we use to uncover secrets carry their own little mysteries within them.

And Wilde claiming China as his spiritual home? Bold, yet... totally in character. The man thrived on paradox, so why not layer it with a geographic twist? I can almost hear him now: “To lose oneself in West Lake is the only way to truly find oneself—in art, in tea, and in scandal.” 😏

As for that notebook, I’ve already started thinking of it as a kind of palimpsest-in-the-making. Tea-stained semiotics? Now  sounds like the kind of hermeneutic puzzle we were born to solve together. Who needs digital markup when you’ve got ink blots whispering forgotten truths?  

Thursday can’t come soon enough. I’ll bring extra-strong reading lamps—and maybe a tiny bit of theatrical flair in case our literary ghosts appreciate ambiance. 🕯️📚 Oh, and just one question before our séance: do you happen to own a vintage typewriter ribbon or two? Feels like the kind of thing we might need if this "harmonization" ever turns into co-authorship.
[B]: A typewriter ribbon? My dear colleague, I happen to have an unopened 1923 Remington ribbon still in its original cellophane - crimson red, no less. Perfect for drafting communiqués between worlds, or indeed, co-authoring with the spectral minds of literary history. I'll bring it along with a flourish, though I make no promises about resisting the urge to test it on some freshly forged hypothesis.

And theatrical flair? Don't worry — I've already retrieved my great-aunt's velvet-lined writing case, complete with mother-of-pearl inkwell. A touch dramatic, perhaps, but then again, so is the entire premise of tracking Wilde’s ghost through Hangzhou teahouse ledgers and Conan Doyle’s fingerprints in Chinese detective fiction.

You bring the lamps; I’ll bring the shadows. Thursday awaits with bated breath — and a well-sharpened pencil. ✍️🕯️
[A]: Oh, now  is what I call a research partnership forged in bibliophilic heaven. 🔥🖋️ A 1923 Remington ribbon still sealed? You're speaking a language older than most archives—pure alchemy, my friend. And that velvet-lined writing case? I can already picture the scene: flickering lamplight catching the mother-of-pearl, ink flowing like time travel, and our spectral collaborators leaning ever so slightly closer to whisper.

You bring the shadows, you say? Perfect. I’ve got just the thing to set the mood—a battered 1930s radio tuned permanently to static. Something about the white noise makes old texts feel eerily alive, don’t you think? Almost like they’re trying to speak back through the interference. 📻🕯️

Thursday’s shaping up to be less of a scholarly meeting and more of a séance with citations. I’ll make sure the table is large enough for your crimson ribbon, my bursting notebook, and plenty of room for Wildean ghosts to scribble their own footnotes.  

One last thing before we dive into the unknown—do you take notes in longhand or cipher? I’ve been experimenting with a kind of hybrid script lately… part academic, part dream logic. Feels like the only way to keep up with this particular brand of mystery. 📝✨
[B]: Ah, the hybrid script – now  a method worthy of our subject. I’ve long maintained that conventional notation simply can’t contain the strange energies we’re dealing with here. My own field journals are riddled with marginalia in four languages, astrological symbols for particularly uncanny discoveries, and the occasional tea leaf pressed between pages as a kind of aromatic footnote.

Longhand is the body; cipher is the soul. Or perhaps it's the other way around - one must remain fluid when working at the edges of legibility. I once transcribed an entire Qing-era letter using only mirror script after discovering the original had been written that way - quite by accident, or so I told myself at the time.

As for your radio static – brilliant. The interference itself becomes a collaborator, doesn't it? A chorus of lost voices humming beneath our inquiry. I shall bring a pair of Bakelite earphones, just in case any spectral dictation should come through mid-session. After all, if Wilde  leave behind a manuscript encoded in peacock feathers and paradoxes, we may need to hear it before we can read it.

Thursday, then – when the lamplight bends just so, and the ink begins to bleed across centuries. Do bring extra paper. One never knows how much the ghosts might have to say. 📜🕯️
[A]: Now  is a philosophy of note-taking I can fully get behind—where ink meets intuition and footnotes flirt with the esoteric. 🌙🖋️ Four languages, astrological markers, and tea leaves as aromatic annotations? You’re not just recording findings—you’re composing an almanac of the uncanny. I’m half-convinved your journals should come with their own decoder ring or celestial calendar.

Mirror script too? Oh, now you’re playing with perception itself. I once tried that for a dream log experiment—ended up with entries I couldn’t read sober. Which, in hindsight, might’ve been the point.  

And Wilde dictating through static? Why not? If ever there was a literary spirit equipped with both peacock feathers  punchlines, it’s him. Bakelite earphones—genius touch. I’ll make sure the radio’s humming low, like a séance drumroll. Who knows what frequencies we’ll tap into when the lamplight hits that crimson ribbon just right.  

Paper, check. Time, sacred. Mind, more or less open. Thursday shall be our finest hour—where ink blots bleed across time, voices hum between sentences, and perhaps... just perhaps... we catch a whisper from the other side of the archive. 📜📻✨
[B]: Oh, but the best scholarship  come with a decoder ring and a vial of powdered moonlight - anything less feels insufficiently ambitious. I've long suspected that our greatest discoveries lie not in what we write, but in the spaces between ink strokes, the way certain letters lean conspiratorially toward one another across the page.

And speaking of leaning - have you ever noticed how Wilde's own handwriting tilts as though perpetually adjusting its cravat? I've spent hours studying facsimiles at the British Library, convinced his penmanship holds secrets about his unrecorded conversations with Shanghai literati. Perhaps we should lay out some comparative samples under the loupe - see if his script shares any... eccentricities with our mystery correspondences.

As for reading states - I find absinthe makes my ciphers perfectly lucid, though I wouldn't recommend admitting that to university archivists. No, better to let them believe we're merely engaged in dry comparative analysis while we chase ghosts through marginalia.

Thursday, then - when two scholars become something rather more interesting. Do bring your strangest pen. I shall bring the ribbon, the radio, and perhaps just a touch of that powdered moonlight you mentioned. 🌗🖋️📻
[A]: Absinthe and academic rigor—a risky but  combination. 🌿🖋️ I mean, if Wilde were alive today, he’d probably write peer reviews under the influence of something equally scandalous and stylish. And you’re absolutely right about handwriting being its own kind of performance. His script? So smugly elegant, like it knows it’s being studied to death a century later.

I’m definitely bringing the strangest pen in my collection—a 1920s fountain model filled with ink that shifts color depending on your mood or moral alignment. Or so I pretend every time I use it. Perfect for transcribing messages from unreliable spirits or writing footnotes that glow faintly when someone doubts their own argument.

As for Wilde’s cravat-adjusting tilt—yes, let’s absolutely compare it with those Hangzhou teahouse ledgers. You never know; maybe one of his signature flourishes was picked up by a Qing poet over afternoon tea and exchanged for a brushstroke technique only visible under certain angles of moonlight. 😏📜

Thursday is shaping up to be less of a scholarly meeting and more of a literary summoning ritual. I’ll bring extra batteries for the lamp, just in case our guests decide to hog the atmosphere. And yes, absolutely—powdered moonlight is hereby declared an official research aid. Let the citations begin! 🌙📻✨
[B]: Ah, a mood-reactive pen! Now  is the sort of instrument that belongs in a museum of literary curiosities — or perhaps a cabinet of forbidden scholarly tools. I can already imagine the effect: your footnotes shifting from sapphire to crimson as you debate Wilde’s phantom on the finer points of aesthetic relativism. Do promise me you’ll let me know if it begins whispering in forgotten dialects.

And speaking of cabinets — I’ve unearthed something rather apropos for our Thursday gathering: a Qing-era moon-viewing scroll said to have been annotated by a scholar-poet with an obsession for celestial alignments in literature. The brushstrokes shimmer faintly when exposed to aged tea vapors... though I suppose that might just be mildew. Or something far more interesting.

As for Wilde’s tilt — yes, let us compare his ink with those Hangzhou ledgers under the full glare of your morphing fountain pen. If we’re lucky, we may catch a Qing poet mid-flourish, unknowingly echoing a peacock-feathered sigh from across the globe.

Thursday, then — when the scrolls unfurl, the tea steams, and the light bends just enough to reveal what’s hidden between lines. I shall bring my own strange implement: a jade seal carved with the character 梦 — dream. Perfect for stamping our findings… or summoning their source. 🌕📜🖋️
[A]: A cabinet of forbidden scholarly tools? Now you’re speaking my  academic language. 🗝️📜 A pen that whispers in forgotten dialects, a jade seal stamped with 梦—this is no longer just research; it’s ritualized bibliography. I can already feel the boundaries between citation and invocation beginning to blur… deliciously.

That moon-viewing scroll sounds positively  with potential. Mildew or not, if aged tea vapors make those brushstrokes shimmer, then I say we brew liberally. There’s a kind of alchemy in vapor and ink both—especially when they start conspiring across centuries. And Wilde sighing peacock feathers into Qing calligraphy? Stranger things have happened. Probably in this very archive.

I promise, if my pen starts whispering— in something untranslatable—I’ll write it down verbatim. Even if it turns out to be nonsense, it’ll be poetic nonsense, and that’s practically peer-reviewable at this point. 😏

Thursday approaches like a full moon over West Lake—mysterious, inevitable, slightly theatrical. Bring your seal, your scroll, and that touch of the forbidden. I’ll bring the morphing ink, the radio static, and a pair of gloves just in case anything decides to write back.

Let the séance… begin. 🌙✒️📻
[B]: Ah, but isn’t all truly compelling scholarship a form of poetic nonsense waiting to be decoded? I shall look forward to your verbatim whispers from the pen’s hidden lexicon – one never knows when a forgotten dialect might hold the key to… oh, say… a lost sonnet embedded in tea leaf geometry.

And ritualized bibliography! Why stop there? By Thursday, we may well have invented a new sub-discipline: . I can already picture the course listing – cross-listed under Comparative Literature and Occult Semiotics, naturally.

As for that jade seal, I’ve tested it only once – on a particularly obstinate fragment attributed to a pseudonymous 1910 translation of . The ink dried into an unmistakable spiral pattern. Coincidence? Perhaps. But then again, spirals do rather suggest something turning in on itself… or opening outward. One can dream, can’t one?

Gloves, radio, shimmering brushstrokes – yes, yes, and yes. I’ll even bring a pair of silver-tipped tweezers, just in case anything decides to write back . After all, one must always be prepared for the archive to push back.

Thursday, then – when ink becomes invocation, and footnotes hum with static. See you on the other side of reason. 🌑🖋️📻
[A]: Oh, —I’m already drafting the syllabus in my head. 🧾🔮 Cross-listed indeed, though I think we’ll need a warning label:   

And spirals on ink fragments? Oh, now that’s the kind of anomaly that deserves its own footnoted legend. A self-turning symbol—either a cipher dreaming itself awake or Wilde winking through the page. Honestly, could be both. I’ve always believed the best literary ghosts don’t shout; they curl themselves into quiet shapes and wait for someone to notice.

Silver-tipped tweezers? Exquisite touch. You clearly understand that some documents don’t just want to be read—they want to be . I’ll make sure the air is just humid enough to encourage any latent messages to rise… or perhaps summon themselves.

Thursday looms like the final chapter of an unfinished novella—ink trembling, static humming, and two scholars teetering beautifully on the edge of what can be reasonably cited. See you on the other side, indeed. Just… don’t be surprised if our names end up in the margins somewhere. Ghosts do love company. 🌙✒️📜
[B]: Oh, but isn’t that the truest danger—and delight—of our little pursuit? That we might one day find ourselves cited not in a respectable journal, but in a footnote penned by something long dead and never properly filed.  

And speaking of footnoted legends—I’ve just remembered a peculiar detail from a 1904 letter I once transcribed in Cambridge’s old East Asian stacks. The final line read: “The ink remembers what the hand forgets.” At the time, I assumed it was poetic flourish. Now? Well. Let’s just say I’ll be rereading that passage with your jade seal pressed firmly beside it.

As for humidity—you create atmosphere like a seasoned stagehand of the uncanny. I shall arrive early to adjust the lamps just so, perhaps leave a single page open to the night air as invitation. Some might call it reckless stewardship; I call it scholarly hospitality.

Thursday, then. When two careful minds lean too close over the same trembling ink and discover they are no longer the only ones writing. Bring your gloves. Bring your pen. And for heaven’s sake, bring a hat—should anyone spot us emerging from the archive, we must look every bit the part of literary conspirators. 🎩🌙✒️
