[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 这个问题很有意思呢~  作为一个整天和尸体打交道的法医，我其实对食物特别挑剔 🔍 中餐的多样性让我着迷，尤其是川菜的麻辣鲜香，但西餐的精致摆盘也很符合我的职业审美 ⚖️
[A]: As a forensic psychiatrist, I must say my perspective on cuisine is rather clinical. I find the chemical interactions in Szechuan peppercorns fascinating - how they create that characteristic numbing sensation by activating TRPA1 receptors. Though I do appreciate the precision of French culinary techniques, particularly in sauce reductions.
[B]: 哇哦，看来我们都在用专业眼光看美食呢！ 你说的花椒素确实很神奇，不过我更关注食物在消化系统的journey~ 你知道吗？中餐的烹饪温度往往更高，这会影响蛋白质denaturation的程度 🧪
[A]: The thermal degradation of proteins is indeed a compelling area of study. In my forensic practice, I often analyze postmortem protein changes, which share some similarities with culinary protein denaturation. Though I must caution against drawing direct parallels - the Maillard reaction in cooking is quite different from the enzymatic breakdown we observe in cadavers.
[B]: 哈哈，你这话让我想起上周解剖时闻到的味道...  等等，这比喻是不是有点倒胃口了？😅 不过说真的，中餐的wok hei和尸体腐败的volatile compounds确实都是thermal decomposition的产物呢~ 虽然一个香喷喷，一个... well, you know ⚗️
[A]: While I appreciate the scientific analogy, perhaps we should maintain some professional decorum. My years of expert testimony have taught me that such... vivid comparisons tend to unsettle jurors during lunch recesses. Shall we discuss something more palatable? The oxidation of polyphenols in tea, perhaps?
[B]: Good point~ 让我们换个轻松点的话题！说到茶，我最近在研究绿茶中的EGCG对DNA protection的作用... 啊糟糕，又绕回实验室了是吧？  要不我们还是聊聊火锅吧，至少那个不会让人联想到autopsy table 🍲
[A]: A measured approach to discourse is always advisable. While hot pot does present interesting questions about communal dining hygiene and cross-contamination risks, it's certainly more... digestible as a dinner conversation than our previous topics. The varying boiling points of different broth ingredients could make for a suitably academic yet socially acceptable discussion.
[B]: 你这种把everything都学术化的能力真是让人佩服！不过说真的，我现在满脑子都是毛肚的collagen content和七上八下的optimal cooking time了... 咱们还是点个外卖吧？我请客，保证不选任何让人联想到work的食材 🥡
[A]: A prudent suggestion. Though I must insist on reviewing the restaurant's health inspection reports beforehand - occupational hazard, I'm afraid. And perhaps we could avoid anything resembling... organ meats. My last court case involved rather too much testimony about hepatic pathology.
[B]: Deal！那就来点安全的sushi吧~ 至少生鱼片不会让我想起tissue sampling... 等等，生食的parasite risk是不是也该考虑？  看来我们这种职业真的没法好好吃饭了 🍣
[A]: Indeed. Perhaps we should simply order pizza and refrain from examining its ingredients too closely. Extra cheese might help suppress our professional instincts... temporarily. Just don't mention the casein protein structure.
[B]: 哈哈，最后这句casein的comment真是绝了！  好吧，就决定是pizza了~ 不过你要答应我不准分析cheese stretch的molecular basis哦！让我们暂时忘记forensic science，就当两个normal people在吃饭 🍕
[A]: A rare moment of professional detachment - I'll endeavor to comply. Though I can't promise not to mentally calculate the pizza's cooling rate curve. Some habits are harder to suppress than others. Pepperoni, then? Plain seems safest... scientifically speaking.
[B]: Perfect！Pepperoni it is~ 至少这次我们聊的不是human tissue samples了，progress！  虽然我可能还是会下意识观察topping的distribution pattern... old habits die hard, eh? 😄
[A]: Precisely. Though I find the statistical distribution of pepperoni slices far more comforting than, say, blood spatter patterns. Shall we consider this our small victory over occupational compulsions? Now, about that imaginary beer - let's not analyze its fermentation process.
[B]: Deal！  为我们的small victory干杯~ 虽然我脑子里已经在计算alcohol absorption rate了... 老天，我们是不是该考虑转行做food critics算了？至少不用整天想着postmortem changes 🍻
[A]: A tempting proposition, though I suspect we'd still end up writing reviews in forensic terminology. "The steak exhibits textbook Maillard reaction characteristics, estimated internal temperature 57°C, with negligible myoglobin denaturation..." No, perhaps we're better suited to our current professions. Cheers to knowing our limitations.
[B]: 哈哈，你说得对！  我们这种人还是乖乖待在morgue和courtroom比较好~ 至少在那里，analyzing every little detail是会被appreciated的！不过今天的conversation真是... uniquely us，对吧？ 😅
