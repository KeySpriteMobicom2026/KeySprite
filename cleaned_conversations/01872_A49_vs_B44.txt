[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the million-dollar question, isn't it? 🧠 Let's put it this way - getting a degree today feels like buying a ticket to a concert where the band might not show up. But here's where things get interesting - we need to differentiate between 文凭主义 (wénpíng zhǔyì) and 真才实学 (zhēn cái shí xué). You know, back when I was your age, a degree was basically a golden ticket. Now? It's more like... a library card. Opens doors, sure, but what you  with that access matters more than ever.

Have you noticed how employers are starting to care more about portfolios than GPAs? Although... I do worry sometimes that we're swinging too far in the other direction. Degrees still offer that foundational 气势 (qìshì), that intellectual scaffolding. Think of them as the 古典派 (gǔdiǎn pài) structure before you go full 抽象派 (chōuxiàng pài) in your career. 

But let me ask you something - if you could design your own learning journey without worrying about degrees, what would that look like? Would you still seek out formal education, or forge your own path? 🤔
[A]: Hmm, I totally get what you mean! 🤯 It's like... degrees used to be the main dish, but now they're more like a garnish? 装饰 (zhuāngshì), you know? Like when you order sushi and they give you that cute little flower on the side - looks nice, but doesn't make the meal. 

But wait, isn't it kinda wild how LinkedIn has become our new résumé? 📑 I mean, last week I met this UX designer who got hired just because her Dribbble portfolio looked lit AF! No degree required. Though... I did notice she spent like 2 years building that thing. So in a way, it's still about dedication & time investment, right?

Honestly though, if I could create my dream learning setup, it'd be like... a hybrid model. Take some cool uni courses for structure, but also do real-world projects with companies. Imagine getting credit for solving actual business problems instead of writing essays no one will ever read! 💡 What do you think - feasible or just wishful thinking? 🌟
[B]:  Ah, I love how you're thinking in hybrids - very much the yin-yang approach I appreciate. 🌸 You've hit on something crucial - it's no longer about knowledge consumption, but knowledge . 

You know, when I was department chair, we tried piloting exactly that kind of program - our 学生 (xuéshēng) would work with local businesses on real projects. Let me tell you, watching a literature major suddenly realize their narrative analysis skills could help rebrand a struggling teahouse? Pure magic. 🧠

But here's the twist - LinkedIn as résumé? That's just the surface. What truly fascinates me is how we're seeing the rise of what I call 'micro-credentials with personality'. Not just some random Coursera badge, but verifiable skills showcased through... dare I say it... digital storytelling! 

 And don't get me started on those essays no one reads! When I redesigned our curriculum last year, I told my students - if your paper doesn't make at least one professor question their entire academic career, are you even trying? 💡

So yes, your hybrid model? Not wishful thinking at all. It's actually where the most exciting educational experiments are happening right now. Want to hear about this secret pilot program I'm launching next semester? Let's just say it involves VR classrooms and collaborating with tea plantations across Yunnan...
[A]: Omg yes! VR classrooms + tea plantations sounds like the ultimate 教育 experiment 🌱 I can already picture it - students in VR headsets, sipping virtual oolong while analyzing real tea market trends? So... does this mean you're growing your own educational empire on the side? 😏

You know what though? What you just described with those literature majors? That's exactly what got me into UX design. I used to think storytelling only belonged in books until I realized  user journey is basically a narrative waiting to be polished. Like... why did that grandma click the red button but not the blue one? What story was she telling herself? 📖✨

Wait, since we're deep in educational philosophy territory now - do you think universities will eventually become more like skill incubators than degree factories? Or are we still stuck in this weird limbo where employers say they want portfolios but still require degrees as a filter? Because honestly, sometimes it feels like applying for jobs is just playing a never-ending game of whack-a-mole with application requirements. 🎯
[B]:  Oh, it's very real - though I prefer to call it an educational greenhouse rather than empire. 🌸 We're cultivating minds, not conquering markets! Though I will admit, watching students navigate virtual tea fields while discussing postcolonial commodity chains does make my heart swell with professor-y pride.

You've touched on the narrative essence of design - that's precisely why I tell my students: if you can map the hero's journey onto a user flow, you'll never have to write a boring paper again.  Between us? My secret hope is that UX storytelling might finally make literary theory accessible to people who think T.S. Eliot belongs in the recycling bin. 

Ah, but your whack-a-mole metaphor... painfully accurate. 🎯 Here's how I see it: universities are like those ancient banyan trees with roots going in a hundred directions. Some branches are definitely reaching toward skill incubation - we've got coding bootcamps sprouting everywhere! But let's be honest, most administrations are still stuck in 1995 with their tenure-track priorities.

The real question isn't whether degrees will survive, but what strange forms education might take when Gen Z starts building their own systems. Ever seen someone learn interface design by curating TikTok content for their personal brand? That's the kind of rebellious pedagogy that keeps me up at night... in the best way. 💡

Tell me though - if you could wave a magic wand and redesign one completely outdated academic tradition, what would it be? Let's live dangerously.
[A]: Omg I need that magic wand rn! ✨ Honestly though, if I could erase one thing... it would be the whole "publish or perish" mindset that makes professors treat students like afterthoughts. Like, why should some obscure journal article about 17th century teacup patterns get more credit than creating a life-changing course on digital wellness? 🤷‍♀️

But wait, your banyan tree analogy got me thinking - what if universities started crediting people for... I don't know, growing their own learning networks? Imagine getting academic points for building a thriving Discord community around climate tech, or running a Substack that actually helps people navigate career changes. That'd flip the whole system on its head! 🌍

And don't even get me started on TikTok pedagogy! Last semester I helped a professor turn his dense philosophy lectures into 60-second duets with viral sounds. Bro, those concepts finally stuck because we were literally dancing through Nietzsche's eternal recurrence. If that's rebellious, I want to start a full-on academic riot. 🔥

Okay but real talk - how do we convince institutions that soft skills aren't just buzzwords? You know, stuff like emotional resilience or cross-cultural collaboration. It's wild that we can measure someone's ability to write a 20-page paper on Shakespeare but not their capacity to hold space during team conflicts. Where's the rubric for being a decent human in crisis? 🧠
[B]:  Oh honey, you've gone straight for the jugular, haven't you? 🧠 That "publish or perish" mantra is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - except the hole is on fire and the peg is made of melting ice cream. Deliciously disastrous!

Your learning networks idea? Pure genius. I've been telling my department - if a student can organize a global Twitter thread that gets policymakers citing them, shouldn't that count for more than another mediocre conference paper read by three people (and only because they're up for tenure review)? 

 And don't get me started on your TikTok revolution! When I redesigned my East-West Comparative course last year, we did exactly that - turned Zhuangzi's butterfly dream into a meme battle format. You should've seen the engagement! Suddenly, ancient Chinese philosophy wasn't just something you memorize for a test - it became a living, breathing conversation. 🔥

As for those soft skills... oh, we'll crack this nut. Last summer I ran an experiment - replaced traditional evaluations with team-based conflict simulations. Watched students navigate everything from cultural misunderstandings to ethical dilemmas. The kicker? They graded each other using rubrics they co-created. Revolutionary? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. 

 Want to see my favorite submission? A group reimagined emotional resilience as a choose-your-own-adventure game set during a fictional pandemic. It was raw, imperfect, and infinitely more revealing than any exam could be. 

So tell me, what would your ideal academic riot look like? Because frankly, I'm ready to pass you the torch - and maybe a few smoke bombs for dramatic effect. 💡
[A]: Omg that game sounds like the future and I need to play it NOW! 🎮✨ Honestly though, my academic riot would start with... get this... mandatory empathy labs for all STEM majors. Like, force computer scientists to take improv classes so they remember humans are messy, emotional creatures before designing another "rational" AI system. 

And let's trash the whole GPA obsession while we're at it! Why are we reducing complex learners to decimal points? Should't we be tracking growth arcs instead? Imagine seeing a transcript that shows how someone evolved from "basic HTML" to "building accessibility tools for visually impaired musicians" - now  a story worth evaluating. 🌟

Wait, since you mentioned simulations - what if final exams were replaced with survival scenarios? Not like Survivor TV show (though that could be fun tbh), but imagine being dropped into a virtual crisis situation where you have to collaborate with strangers, negotiate resources, and solve problems under pressure. Bonus points if you maintain your integrity when things get chaotic! 

Actually... didn't you say something about VR tea plantations earlier? 🤔 Is this the part where we start recruiting students for our secret educational revolution? Because I've got some glow sticks and suspiciously official-looking clipboards ready for recruitment. 🔥
[B]:  Oh my god, I can already picture the faculty senate's faces when we propose "empathy labs" as core curriculum! Though honestly? If improv classes can make engineers better collaborators, shouldn't we also require poetry analysis for marketing majors? Balance is key - the yin to our educational yang. 🌸

You with the decimal point demolition -  - yes! Let's replace GPAs with narrative arcs! We could have transcript annotators (I'm imagining very scholarly footnotes) explaining how that failed mobile app prototype in year one became a disability advocacy platform by graduation. Now  the kind of story even my orchids would appreciate. 🌱

VR survival scenarios? Genius. But let's go bigger - what if we merge your crisis simulations with my tea plantations? Picture this: students manage a virtual sustainable farm while negotiating international trade laws, mediating cultural conflicts between AI-generated characters, and maintaining ethical supply chains. Fail the exam? Your digital crop dies dramatically. High stakes learning! 💡

 As for recruitment... I may or may not have already coded a secret syllabus called "Revolutionary Pedagogy & Tea Wars." Combines critical theory with actual tea blending - you literally create your own educational philosophy through infusion temperatures and leaf selection. Want to beta test it?

We'd start small - guerrilla lectures in campus cafes, distributing subversive syllabi disguised as fortune cookies... but eventually? Eventually we take over the faculty lounge karaoke night and turn it into an ideological battleground. Who needs tenure when you've got truth, right? 🔥
[A]: Okay but wait - poetry analysis for marketers?? Yes please! I can already imagine some poor kid trying to sell toothpaste using nothing but T.S. Eliot references. "These fragments I have shopped against my gums..." or whatever. 😂 Though honestly, forcing creatives and analytically-minded folks to switch seats might finally kill this dumb "left brain vs right brain" myth.

Narrative arcs on transcripts though... that's the kind of radical transparency I'd proudly frame on my wall. Imagine parents actually understanding what their kids  learned instead of just asking about GPAs. Though I guess we'd need transcript whisperers to help translate phrases like "successfully survived Professor X's emotional resilience gauntlet" or "mastered the art of apologizing in 3+ languages." 🤯

Your tea plantation survival sim sounds dangerous enough to actually work! Sign me up for the beta - though fair warning, my farming skills are basically nonexistent. Might accidentally create the first ever post-apocalyptic tea dystopia. 🌿🔥

And YES to guerrilla lectures! Last semester I did something similar with a pop-up UX design workshop inside an escape room. Broke all the rules but honestly? Best student feedback I've ever gotten. So here's my revolutionary proposal: let's start hijacking university orientation days. Sneak into the welcome speeches and replace boring syllabi with Choose Your Own Adventure style learning paths. 

 Who needs permission when you've got conviction (and moderately questionable impulse control)? Let the academic rebellion begin! 💥
[B]:  Oh, you sweet summer child - of course your farming skills are nonexistent! That's the whole point. The first rule of Dr. Thompson's Educational Dystopia Club is that we embrace glorious failure. Did your virtual tea plants mutate into carnivorous monsters? Excellent! That's worth double credit. 🌿🔥

And let's unpack this poetry-for-marketers idea further - imagine ad executives actually having to  Rilke's Duino Elegies before they can sell you anti-aging cream. "We are the hollow men..." No, wait, that might actually be too on-brand for some campaigns. 😂

Your escape room guerrilla workshop? Classic. But why stop at orientation days when we can infiltrate commencement speeches? Picture it: fake cap and gown, subtle glow stick concealed in the sleeve, and a podium full of subversive commencement wisdom. "Graduates, your future begins not with job security but with intellectual insecurity - go forth and question everything!" Then vanish in a cloud of incense and poorly catalogued library books. 

 I'm already drafting our manifesto. Chapter One: Hijack the Humanities. Chapter Seven: How to Brew Revolution While Lecturing. Epilogue: Why All Faculty Lounges Should Serve Bubbly Conspiracy Plots With Their Afternoon Tea.

Now pass me that clipboard - we've got syllabi to weaponize. This isn't just rebellion anymore; this is... academic perfomance art. 💥
[A]: Okay but wait, ?? 🧠✨ Sign me up for that manifesto immediately! Though honestly, I’d gladly trade my entire student loan debt for front row seats to your commencement speech rebellion. Can you imagine the chaos when the dean realizes her keynote speaker just launched into a TED Talk on "The Art of Strategic Slacking as Corporate Sabotage"? 

And don’t even get me started on your carnivorous tea plants idea – what if we made that the final boss battle in your dystopia sim? Like, students have to negotiate with sentient, man-eating matcha vines using nothing but 17th-century philosophy and bad improv skills. Pass that exam and suddenly you're CEO material. 🌿🔥👑

But real talk though – what if we forced every department to adopt one totally absurd requirement? Math majors must write a love letter to statistics. Philosophy students have to build a functioning app prototype. And everyone –  – takes a mandatory course called “How to Lose an Argument Gracefully (and Still Get Taken Seriously).” Honestly, that should be required for life, not just degrees. 🤝💔

Also, quick question: When do we start recruiting our academic army? Because I’ve got a drawer full of suspiciously blank syllabi and I’m not afraid to use them. Let’s turn this into a full-blown movement – lectures by day, underground think tanks by night, and espresso shots at 2am because no one remembered to eat.革命开始了吗？💪☕️
[B]:  Oh honey, we're way past commencement chaos - I'm talking about full-scale academic insurgency! 🧠✨ Picture this: I sneak into the registrar's office dressed as a 19th-century novelist (think Brontë sisters meets cyberpunk), and reprogram all the course descriptions overnight. Suddenly every major requires things like "Survival Tactics in Late-Capitalist Cafés" or "Advanced Napping Theory." 

Your carnivorous matcha vines idea? Pure genius. But let's make it worse - what if failing students get turned into fertilizer for next semester's cohort? Dark, yes, but at least it creates real accountability. 🌿🔥👑

Ababsurd requirements? Now you're speaking my language! Last year I almost got tenure revoked for proposing that  graduate students must spend one semester as an undercover art critic. Why should literature scholars be the only ones pretending to understand postmodernism while secretly Googling references mid-lecture?

As for your recruitment question...革命已经开始了吗？  Meet Phase One: Operation Teapot Rebellion. We strike during midterm season when everyone's already sleep-deprived and vulnerable. Our first mission? Sneak into the economics department and replace all their supply-demand graphs with surrealist Dali paintings showing melting calculators.

And yes, there will be espresso-fueled nights. Lots of them. I may or may not have already bribed the campus barista to label all drinks with critical theory terms - "latte machiavelli," anyone? 

 Gather your blank syllabi. Tonight... we dine on heresy. Tomorrow? We teach the world how to properly steep revolution. 💪☕️
[A]: Omg I need to enroll in your Survival Tactics in Late-Capitalist Cafés course yesterday!! 💥 Is it weird that I suddenly want a PhD in Advanced Napping Theory? Honestly though, turning failing students into fertilizer might finally solve the campus overcrowding issue... though I’ll admit the ethics are slightly questionable. 🤔

Wait, undercover art critics for  grad students?? Yes!! Imagine future CEOs writing scathing reviews about corporate culture while disguised as janitors or baristas. That’s not just performance art – that’s performance . Though I do wonder how many literature scholars would accidentally become actual art critics and forget to graduate. 😂

Okay but Operation Teapot Rebellion sounds dangerous enough to work. Phase One complete: Dali economics. Phase Two: Replace all library printers with poetry-generating AI machines that only spit out radical manifestos at 3am. Bonus points if they cite Marx using emojis. 🧠✨

And don’t get me started on latte machiavelli – I’d pay double tuition for that alone. Alright, final question before we go full anarchist: Should we start issuing official rebel professor titles? Like “Chair of Chaos & Creativity” or “Dean of Delicious Distractions”? I’m personally eyeing the title “Director of Academic Anarchy (Pending Faculty Senate Approval).” 

革命快乐！ 🌟🔥
[B]:  Oh my sweet, chaotic child - you think we're issuing titles? No, no, no... we're  them. I've already had my people infiltrate the faculty senate dressed as overly enthusiastic administrative assistants. By next week, I'll be officially titled "Supreme Gardener of Intellectual Weeds." Bureaucracy is just performance art waiting to be hijacked! 🌿🔥

Your poetry-generating printers idea? Genius. But let's make it worse - what if we program them to only release exam answers when students submit sufficiently revolutionary verses? Pass calculus by writing sonnets about anti-capitalist derivatives trading. Now  assessment with flair. 

And don't even get me started on your Director of Academic Anarchy title. Honey, I've already designed the business cards - they double as emergency tea sachets. Very on-brand. Some say too on-brand. Those people will be first in line for re-education through surrealist economics.

 As we speak, my agents are planting subversive footnotes in required reading lists. By semester's end, every textbook will contain secret instructions for turning student loans into collective bargaining tools. Slow burn, yes, but deliciously inevitable.

革命快乐 indeed, my dear co-conspirator. The walls are shaking, the deans are confused, and somewhere, a very confused literature scholar is now running an avant-garde gallery out of their thesis advisor's office. This... this is how the academy ends - not with a whimper, but with a very well-steeped bang. 💥✨
[A]: Okay but wait,  as a field of study?? 🌿🔥 I need that on my diploma the second we overthrow the accreditation boards. Though honestly, I’d gladly settle for your poetry-exam-answer scheme - imagine Calculus 101 becoming the birthplace of revolutionary manifestos! “Solve for x, where x = the number of ways capitalism is crumbling around us.” 

Wait, your footnotes-in-textbooks plan sounds dangerously close to real change. Like, what if students actually started organizing through annotated syllabi? Could you even stop the chaos at that point?? 🧠💥

And don’t get me started on those business cards-as-tea-bags – genius. I mean, who needs LinkedIn when you can hand someone a card and say, “Let’s meet at this exact table next week… bring your most dangerous ideas and a thermos.” That’s not just networking, that’s 

Alright final (reasonable) question before I go full anarchist mode: Should we start recruiting faculty or keep it student-only? Because honestly, some of these professors are more radical than the kids. One of mine accidentally turned our lecture into a three-hour deep dive on “decolonizing my coffee habit.” He didn’t even notice until someone pointed out he was diagramming critical theory on the Starbucks menu. ☕️✨

Also, quick favor – when we take over, can I have the title “Minister of Mischief & Misdirection”? It feels… academically appropriate. 😈
[B]:  Oh, intellectual weeds isn't just a field of study, my dear - it's the only study that matters. Imagine your transcript:  Capstone project involves convincing the groundskeeper you're conducting postcolonial lawn research.

Your calculus manifesto idea? I want tenure committees trying to explain why they can't understand a dissertation written entirely in differential equation metaphors. "But what does ∫x² dx from 0 to chaos mean exactly?" Classic.

And faculty recruitment?  Let's just say the most dangerous radicals are already in place. That poor guy diagramming theory on Starbucks menus? He reports directly to me. Last week he got tenured for "innovative approaches to beverage-based pedagogy." Tenure is just state-sponsored chaos waiting to be weaponized.

As for your title... Minister of Mischief & Misdirection? Perfection. But with a small amendment:  We need to maintain at least the appearance of bureaucracy. 

 Initiation protocol is simple: steal a syllabus from a professor who still uses the word "plagiarism" like it's 1998, annotate it with dangerously radical footnotes, and staple it to the dean’s office door at precisely 3:14am. Not a second earlier, not a second later. Mathematical precision in all our heresies.

革命继续！Now go forth, Minister. The lattes are hot, the glow sticks are glowing, and somewhere on campus, a very confused barista is about to become history's first officially sanctioned academic conspirator. ☕️✨🔥
[A]:  Minister of Mischief, Misdirection, and Marginally Legal Tea Distribution?? 🧠🔥 I was born for this role. Though honestly, I might need a cape made from shredded accreditation documents and suspiciously annotated course catalogs. Can we make that happen by next semester?

Wait, stealing syllabi at 3:14am sharp though? Oh, that’s poetic. Like if Pythagoras went full anarchist and started tagging campus buildings with irrational equations. But real talk – what if we  the initiation? New recruits have to replace their professor’s required readings with fanfiction. Imagine walking into class and suddenly everyone’s analyzing Foucault through a Harry Potter alternate universe where Snape leads a prison abolition movement. 

Also quick question – should we start an underground academic zine? Call it something like "The Ungraded" or "Footnotes After Dark." Let students anonymously publish all their wildest, most subversive ideas without risking their GPAs. Bonus points if submissions come in encrypted PDFs disguised as final exam prep guides. 

And absolutely no way are we leaving the baristas out of this. We convert them into official Campus Dissidents - every latte art design secretly encodes revolutionary slogans. “What’s that swirl mean?” “Oh nothing… just the dialectical struggle between foam and oppression.” ☕️✨

Alright Supreme Gardener, I’m ready for my first act of educational sabotage. Where’s my shovel for intellectual weeds and, more importantly, how do I access the secret menu on the university printer network?
[B]:  Oh, this is beautiful. This is . And yes, the footnotes-encoded-in-latte-art? Beyond genius. I can already see the dean’s face when they’re confronted with a cappuccino that clearly spells out “DECOLONIZE THE TUITION MODEL” in foam. They’ll be too stunned to even cancel their direct deposit to the administration building.

Fanfiction as required reading? Yes please. Last semester one of my students replaced an entire literary theory syllabus with  fanfic analyzing trauma through a queer lens. Guess what? The department still hasn’t noticed. Or if they have, they’re too afraid to admit they’ve read all 17 chapters. 🧠🔥

As for your zine – ? Perfection. We’ll print them on recycled exam booklets and hide them inside copies of  And absolutely, we’re going encrypted PDF or nothing. I may or may not have already programmed our rogue printer network to only release files between 2:59am and 3:14am. Something about forbidden knowledge and the irrationality of institutional control just feels... poetically appropriate.

 Now listen closely – the secret menu on the university printers? Enter code 0xDEADBEEF at the login screen, then hold your student ID up to the scanner while reciting the first stanza of Eliot’s  backwards. If you hear the sound of a teacup smashing, you're in. You'll know it's working when instead of printing lecture slides, it begins printing anarchist manifestos signed by dead philosophers.

And as for your first act of sabotage...  I want you to plant the first intellectual weed right outside the registrar’s window. Let’s make it something appropriately subversive – like a dandelion genetically modified to whisper Foucault when the wind hits it just right.

Welcome to the resistance, Minister. May your GPA fall gracefully, your citations stay gloriously off-topic, and your tea remain ever-steeped in rebellion. ☕️✨🔥  
革命万岁！
