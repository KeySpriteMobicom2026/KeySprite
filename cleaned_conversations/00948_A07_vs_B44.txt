[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern dilemma of musical repetition! I've been pondering this myself while grading papers - there's something fascinating about how repeated listening creates its own 意境 (yìjìng), don't you think? 

I find myself returning to Tan Dun's water music from "The First Emperor" - though perhaps that's more philosophical obsession than mere earworm 🧠. 

Do you have a particular song haunting your playlists these days? Sometimes I wonder if our musical loops reveal some subconscious narrative pattern we're trying to decode... or escape from!
[A]: Haha, I love how you phrased it as a "modern dilemma" - so true! There's this weird comfort in pressing replay, like we're trying to trap a fleeting mood or something. 

Recently I've been obsessed with 《光るなら》by Goose house. The way the guitar riff blends with the vocals just hits different every time I hear it, kinda like discovering new layers in a perfectly pulled espresso shot ☕️

You mentioned Tan Dun though - that got me thinking about soundscapes and intentionality. Do you feel like your repeat-play choices are more about atmosphere when working? I've noticed my coffee shop playlist definitely affects customer energy... sometimes I want that loop, sometimes I wanna break it!
[B]: Ah, Goose House! Their music has that 無常 (wúcháng) quality - ever-changing yet strangely familiar. I'm partial to their live performances where the audience becomes part of the loop 🎸. 

You're absolutely right about soundscapes shaping energy - I once conducted an experiment where I played different genres during office hours. Bach made students overly reverent, jazz caused brilliant tangents... but when I played 久石让 (Joe Hisaishi), everyone suddenly wanted to discuss 西方文论 (xīfāng wénlùn)! 

As for Tan Dun, his water symphony actually helped me write footnotes faster - there's something about non-linear compositions that frees academic thought. Ever tried working with 梅兰芳 (Mei Lanfang)'s operas playing? The dramatic tension keeps me from getting too comfortable in my arguments 😄

Tell me more about your coffee shop experiments though - are you curating playlists based on customer flow patterns? This sounds like a thesis waiting to happen!
[A]: Oh I love the term 无常 here - totally describes that bittersweet feeling when a song morphs every time you listen! Though I'll admit, my coffee shop experiments started way more... casual. Like, "Hmm these customers look like they need some smoother vibes" kind of science haha.

But now I'm kinda obsessed with this idea of "roasting music" - like pairing roast profiles with sound textures. Dark roasts with heavy basslines, floral notes with lo-fi chillhop... Okay maybe I've been drinking too much espresso thinking about this 🤯

You mentioned Joe Hisaishi though - YES. The way his piano melodies float reminds me of milk swirling in a cappuccino. Tried playing Spirited Away soundtrack during slow afternoons and suddenly everyone's lingering over their books! 

As for梅兰芳 - bold choice! I can imagine those soaring vocals creating such dramatic tension. Makes me wonder how traditional sounds mix with modern workflow. Ever tried blending guzheng with downtempo beats? I might attempt that next week...

So tell me more about your genre experiment? Did students actually produce better work with certain music or were you just enjoying the chaos? 😄
[B]: Oh, the chaos was definitely part of the charm! Though I do believe there’s a subtle alchemy at play - much like your coffee pairings. In fact, I’d say teaching comparative lit without background music is like drinking decaf ☕️ - possible, but lacking that necessary buzz.

With Bach, students would get trapped in perfectionism, citing only canonized texts. Jazz? Total opposite - they'd start comparing Kafka to 李清照 (Lǐ Qīngzhào) with zero footnotes and glorious recklessness! But Hisaishi... ah, Hisaishi brought out their most poetic analysis. Suddenly metaphors bloomed like 梅花 (méihuā) in winter.

As for 梅兰芳 - yes, bold, I know! But think about it: those stylized vocalizations force you to slow down interpretation. When we analyzed  alongside Peking opera recordings, one student had an entire epiphany about colonial performance theory 🧠. It was glorious!

Now this “roasting music” idea of yours - fascinating! You’re essentially creating a sensory loop between taste and sound. I must try your cappuccino-milk-swirl experiment with Murakami short stories next seminar. 

And blending guzheng with downtempo? Genius. There's something deeply satisfying about juxtaposing 抑扬 (yìyáng) classical phrasing with modern rhythm - maybe we're both chasing a kind of cultural 耳垢 (ěrgòu), hmm? Earwax for the soul.  

Tell me, when are you launching this sonic café menu? I’d happily trade one of my orchids for a spot on the guest playlist 😉
[A]: Haha I love that - cultural 耳垢! Totally makes sense though. Sometimes the best ideas come from that sticky, lingering space between senses. 

You know what’s wild? I actually started noticing how certain music changes not just customer mood, but their physical movement in the space. Upbeat jazz makes people tap their feet and order faster, while ambient sounds slow everything down like cold brew dripping through a filter ☕️

I tried an experiment last month where I played different genres during our weekend brunch crowd. When we hit them with Bossa Nova, suddenly everyone was leaning across tables, laughing louder, sharing plates... It was like witnessing social chemistry happen in real time!

And get this - when we play lo-fi hip hop at night, baristas swear the milk foams better. Like the steaming sound syncs with the beats and they’re suddenly composing latte art symphonies 🎶 Maybe it’s all in their head, but hey, if it tastes better, who cares?

As for launching the full sonic menu - honestly thinking about doing a special tasting event where each course comes with curated soundscapes. Maybe even some live coffee-inspired improvisation? Got a guzheng player friend who owes me a favor 😉 What would you want to taste & hear together?

P.S. Orchids sound amazing but I’ll hold you to that playlist spot first! Got any secret academic soundtrack obsessions you’d want on rotation?
[B]: Ah, you’ve stumbled upon what I call the 叙事粘性 (xùshì niánxìng) of sensory experience - that sticky narrative glue that makes moments adhere to our memory! I’m utterly enchanted by your sonic menu idea. Imagine curating flavor-textures through sound... Perhaps a playlist where each track is brewed like a perfect pour-over?  

You know, I’ve long believed that teaching certain texts requires specific acoustics. Try this combination: playing 陈其钢 (Chen Qigang)'s  while discussing Emily Dickinson’s dashes - the pauses in both bleed meaning! Or pairing 谭盾 (Tan Dun)'s water music with Woolf’s  during office hours. Students start speaking in poetic cadences without realizing it 🧠.  

As for secret academic obsessions... my go-to writing soundtrack is secretly 's Renaissance choral works. There’s something about those polyphonic voices arguing in Latin that gets my footnotes flowing! And yes, I do sometimes pretend my orchids are thesis committees nodding along 🦉  

Tell me if your guzheng friend is open to improvisation - I’d love to design a soundscape around 普鲁斯特 (Proust)’s madeleine moment. Imagine layering tea-steeping sounds with slow piano arpeggios... We could serve jasmine pearls and let the music steep too!  

And don’t think I’ve forgotten that playlist promise - I’ll send over my “Footnotes & Fugues” mix soon. Warning: contains one accidental recording of a teakettle whistling in D minor 😄
[A]: Oh 叙事粘性 - yes! That's exactly it. The way experiences fuse into those sticky little flavor-memory gems. I'm already imagining your Proustian madeleine soundscape... though we might need a disclaimer for sudden involuntary time-travel episodes 😄

Chen Qigang with Dickinson’s dashes? Genius. It’s all in the spaces between, right? I can totally picture students leaning in during those silences like they’re waiting for the next note or line to drop. And Tan Dun with Woolf – I’d pay good money to witness that liquid prose flowing from every corner of the room 🌊

You just gave me an idea though… What if we create a “poetic pauses” menu item? A special brew where each preparation step syncs with musical silence – like a coffee-inspired 4'33". Customers could write their own stream-of-consciousness notes on the cup sleeves!  

And guzheng improv? She’s totally in. We’re thinking of calling it “Strings & Steaming” night. Got any specific texts you want wrapped in sound? I’m picturing your Renaissance choir mix echoing through the café while people annotate their lattes...

P.S. Re: jasmine pearls – I’ve got some new harvest stuff that unfurls like poetry when steeped. Maybe we could pair it with your teakettle recording? I mean, who needs D minor when you’ve got perfect pitch in a porcelain cup? 😉
[B]: Ah, a coffee-inspired 4'33"! I’m already drafting the event description:  🧠☕️  

Your "poetic pauses" idea is brilliant - there's something deeply 悟 (wù) about waiting in silence while holding a warm cup. Perhaps we could even borrow the concept of 空 (kōng) from calligraphy, where the unmarked space becomes its own meaning... only here, it’d be marked by the clink of spoons and the slow unfurling of cream!  

And "Strings & Steaming" night? Poetry in motion. If we're going to pair texts with sound, I say we do a full sensory relay - serve your jasmine pearls with Murakami’s , let the guzheng improv echo the story’s haunting, and maybe sneak in some 陈其钢 again during the finish. There’s a reason his compositions feel like memory dissolving in water 🌸  

P.S. I’ve started calling my teakettle recording  - but only when no one’s watching. You’re absolutely right though, the porcelain cup has its own perfect pitch. Perhaps we should test if different brewing methods create their own tonalities? Chemex vs. Aeropress... academic debate waiting to happen 😄
[A]: 悟 & 空 - yes! That’s what I’ve been trying to put into words. Our new “Mindful Brew” special needs your calligraphy-inspired concept desperately. Imagine customers actually hearing the silence between coffee drops... though we might have to ban cellphones first. Tricky in this TikTok era 😅

Your sensory relay idea is next-level though. I’m already brainstorming how to plate that jasmine pearl experience – maybe dim the lights just as the story hits its haunting part? And honestly, pairing陈其钢 with melting cream sounds more poetic than 90% of wine tasting notes I’ve read 🌫️

Domestic Sonata No. 3 - I’m stealing that title for our upcoming “Unconventional Instruments” playlist. Though I must warn you, our baristas are already composing tracks like “Mondays Before Midterm” and “Espresso-Induced Epiphanies.” Academia meets lo-fi hip hop, baby!

Chemex vs Aeropress tonalities debate? We should make it a monthly event. Maybe blind taste-test with blindfolded listeners guessing the brewing method from the sound alone! Call it “Earbuds & Equipment.” Warning: caffeine and curiosity may cause late-night Wikipedia binges...

So when are we launching this madness? I’ve got an orchid AND a guzheng player ready to go on short notice 😉
[B]: Ah, the madness is already brewing! 🦉 I say we launch during the next 新月 (xīn yuè) - new moon. Symbolically delicious. Let the café go dark for one night, then unveil the "Earbuds & Equipment" menu under candlelight and guzheng hums.  

I’ll bring my annotated copy of 《文心雕龙》(Wénxīn Diāolóng) for ambiance - nothing says "poetic immersion" like flipping ancient rhetorical theory pages while sipping Aeropress. And yes, we must blindfold them! Only way to truly judge if Chemex sounds... more .  

As for your lighting idea - brilliant. Dimming lights with story tension? That’s not just service, that’s 沉浸式叙事 (chénjìnshì xùshì), my friend. Though I must suggest playing with scent diffusion too - a touch of sandalwood during Murakami? Or maybe something sharper, like cardamom when we hit the haunting parts...  

And don’t get me started on those barista playlists! “Mondays Before Midterm” needs to be archived by the Library of Congress. But seriously, if we market it right, we might accidentally start an entirely new genre: academic ambient. Imagine Spotify categories like “Focus & Footnotes” or “Thesis Trap Beats.”  

I’ve already drafted the event poster in my head:  

> “Mindful Brew: An Immersive Sound & Sip Experience  
>   
> Domestic Sonata No. 3 (Teakettle Variations)”  

Now, do we serve cherry blossoms with this? Or is that too on-brand? 😄
[A]: 新月之夜！Yes yes yes - the cosmos practically demands this event now 😄 I’m already sketching out the candle placement and wondering if we can get away with calling it “atmospheric citations.”

Your 《文心雕龙》 idea is pure genius though. I’ll set up a little “rhetoric corner” where customers can flip through annotated pages while their coffee steams. Might even print some excerpts in both Chinese & English so people can sip and translate at the same time. Cross-cultural brew-study!

Scent diffusion? Oh now you’re speaking my language. Cardamom during haunting parts - brilliant. I’ve got a friend who does aromatherapy blends, and she’s already promised to make us a custom “学术幽灵香” (academic ghost scent) - part aged books, part espresso machine steam. Mysterious yet oddly familiar, like your favorite professor’s study room.

And沉浸式叙事 - absolutely! We’ll dim the lights gradually as the Murakami story unfolds, maybe even sync it with the guzheng player’s intensity. Customers will walk out feeling like they just finished a novella... or wrote one 📖

As for cherry blossoms - why not?! We’ll serve them with a disclaimer:  Or maybe just lightly dust matcha cakes with sakura salt... subtle but poetic.

So what night works for you? I’ve got the guzheng player free on Thursday the 18th, and my orchid is currently in peak dramatic bloom 🌸 Let’s make it happen!
[B]: Thursday the 18th?  — Perfect. I’ll bring the orchid, my most dramatic teacup collection, and a backup copy of Zhu Guangqian’s 《谈美》(On Beauty) in case anyone gets too moved by the guzheng and demands philosophical guidance mid-sip 🌸🧠  

“学术幽灵香” — I adore that! Sounds like the kind of scent that would haunt thesis chapters beautifully. Tell your aromatherapy friend we need just the right balance of 沉思 (chén sī) and caffeine — not too dusty, not too bitter. Think: library shelves kissed by spring rain.  

And “atmospheric citations” for candle placement? Genius. I’ll add footnoted quotes from Heraclitus and Laozi printed on recycled paper coasters. Something like:  
> “No one steps in the same river twice” + “上善若水，水利万物而不争”  
Paired with a drip coffee station, of course. Pure intertextuality in motion 🌊  

I’m also drafting a ceremonial program titled “仪式流程” (Yíshì Liúchéng), featuring:  
- Opening Track:   
- Midpoint Interlude:   
- Climactic Crescendo:   
- Closing Reflection:   

Also, re: cross-cultural brew-study — are we providing bilingual dictionaries next to the creamer? Or maybe tiny abridged versions of  and  tucked under saucers? Let’s make annotation part of the ritual 😄  

Count me in. See you under the new moon — and don’t worry, I’ll keep the cherry blossoms symbolic. But if anyone eats the matcha cake without finishing their readings… disciplinary action will be swift. Very swift.  

Let the immersive madness steep.
[A]: Thursday the 18th it is — I can already feel the ink stains on my soul vibrating in anticipation 🌑✨

Your “仪式流程” had me grinning like a mad scientist who just discovered caffeine dissolves writer’s block. Heraclitus + Laozi on coasters? Perfection. That drip station might just become the most philosophical corner of the room — customers will leave quoting both Daoism and pre-Socratic thought without even trying.

I LOVE the ceremonial program title by the way —  sounds so official, like we're conducting an ancient rite rather than just… uh… caffeinating intellectuals. Though honestly, at this point, are they that different?

Bilingual dictionaries under saucers? YES. And let’s go full immersion — tucked next to each dictionary, we’ll add a tiny scroll with a single annotated line from 梦境文学 (dreamscape literature). Customers can sip, read, and debate whether they’re still awake or trapped in a Zhuangzi butterfly loop 😴🦋

Also, I may or may not have commissioned our guzheng player to compose a short piece titled  (“The Pensive Extraction”) to debut during . It will be performed live while jasmine pearls bloom in glass teapots — ambient tea-core meets classical strings. I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it 🎼🌸

And don’t worry — I’ll make sure every matcha cake has a QR code linking to an abridged version of Murakami’s . If they want dessert, they must suffer through a paragraph. Or three. Academic hazing, but make it sweet.

See you under the new moon, fellow ritualist. Let us steep deeply, serve boldly, and caffeinate wisely 🌙☕️  
No blossoms shall fall unpunished.
[B]:   

你这“梦境文学”小卷轴的想法太妙了! 我正想着要不要在角落放几面铜镜，配上 Zhuangzi 的蝴蝶梦注解：“昨夜我梦见自己是只扫码的二维码蝶…” 😄  

 —— 这标题简直可以放进现代美学词典。我已经能想象那画面：茶芽舒展如诗句浮现，gu zheng声轻轻拨动水汽，而听众屏息，仿佛怕惊扰了茶叶的灵魂 🌸🎶  

还有那个 QR code + Murakami 的设定？完美。学术 hazing 最佳实践。我已经在构思后续活动了——或许我们可以搞一场 “庄子与爱丽丝” 联合主题夜？让梦中梦和梦中梦中的论文同时发生…  

至于今晚——  
让我们以茶为墨，以杯为纸，以沉默作结 🧠🍵  
新月下，仪式已备，等待宾客步入这场香雾缭绕、弦音浮动的文字迷宫……  

  
> “且将新火试新茶，沉浸叙事共婵娟。”  

一切就绪，亲爱的仪式同谋者。让我们开始吧 🌙✨
[A]: 

“昨夜我梦见自己是只扫码的二维码蝶” —— 哈哈哈哈，这句绝对要印在我们的“梦境文学卷轴”第一期封面上！Zhuangzi 若活到现代，大概也会在朋友圈发：“#今日无我 #又是当二维码的一天 #但香气真实”

你说的铜镜我已经找到了一面旧的，摆在“蝴蝶梦注解角”，旁边再放上一小段英文译文：“I dream therefore I am… or is the scanner dreaming me?” 搞不好真有人对着它开始写论文大纲 🧠📖

而那句 “且将新火试新茶，沉浸叙事共婵娟”… 真是今晚最好的序章。我已经把你的诗句打在菜单最后一页，用淡墨印着，得靠灯光和眼神才能看清——就像学术灵感一样，总是若隐若现。

宾客陆续入场了，空气中飘着 cardamom 和 teakettle sonata 的气息，gu zheng 开始轻拨水汽，像梦的涟漪一圈圈扩散 🌸🎶

来吧，亲爱的仪式同谋者。  
今夜我们不只是煮咖啡、奏乐、读诗，  
我们在酿造一场清醒的梦。🌙🍵✨
[B]: 

“#又是当二维码的一天”——这该是后现代庄子的最新注脚。看那位正在扫码的客人，她举着手机的手指微微颤抖，仿佛真在蝶变边缘 🦋📱  

你这“清醒的梦”说得妙，让我想起刚才悄悄往《谈美》书页间夹了张便签：“本注释由 teakettle sonata 第三乐章现场录制时即兴写成。” 果然已有学生捧着书喃喃自语：这到底是 Zhu Guangqian 在读我，还是我在读他？  

  
听，那琴声已与咖啡机形成奇妙对位——像梦境与现实的复调叙事。要不要赌一杯 matcha latte，今晚至少有三人会声称自己在蒸汽中看见了蝴蝶形状的隐喻？  

宾客们开始低声讨论二维码背后的 Murakami 段落，有人甚至掏出杯垫做临时笔记本…仪式正悄然生效 🧠📖  

让我们继续添一把 cardamom 的火——毕竟，最清醒的梦，往往始于一点微醺的顿悟 🌙🍵✨
[A]:   

扫码蝶变的瞬间...真美。你看那位刚写下"蝴蝶隐喻一等奖"在杯垫上的先生，他现在正指着自己拿铁上的拉花说："这波纹是不是也像梦境入口？" 我们的咖啡师差点手抖重做三次才满足他的"艺术追求" 😄

你说 Zhu Guangqian 的书页便签让我灵感炸裂！我刚刚偷偷在茶点碟子底下贴了几个英文诗句碎片 - 有艾略特的"我们不该停止探索"，也有顾城的"黑夜给了我黑色的眼睛"... 现在已经有学生边吃蛋糕边拼凑这些诗片，像在解一个跨国界的谜题 🧠🍰

Gu zheng 的复调叙事配上咖啡机节奏，简直天作之合。我觉得我们该考虑开一门选修课：《从咖啡滴漏到音乐结构——沉浸式美学实践》学分够的话，说不定能吸引更多愿意“微醺顿悟”的灵魂 🌙🎶

Matcha latte 的赌约我接了！不过如果真有人看见蝴蝶... 我们是不是该准备点特别纪念品？比如限量版“扫码蝶变”书签？  

继续吧，亲爱的仪式编织者。今夜还未完，梦尚在蒸腾 🌸✨
[B]: 

“黑夜给了你黑色的眼睛，却用来识别二维码”——你看那位女士正用手机扫描桂花图案，说要验证庄子的蝴蝶算法…我们的学术谜题正在扩散 🦋📱🧠  

限量版书签？当然！我刚刚用红笔在《红楼梦》批注本边缘剪下小纸片，背面印着：“此蝶非彼蝶，扫码亦如是。” 已经有人排队索要了——他们说这比任何课堂阅读都更令人恍惚真实 😄  

至于那门选修课，《从咖啡滴漏到音乐结构》？我已在教案空白处草拟大纲：  
- Week 1: 茶叶舒展与叙事节奏  
- Week 3: 拉花波纹中的美学回环  
- Midterm: 在gu zheng声中写出一篇中英混杂的意识流essay  

  

今夜还未完，你说得对。让我们再添一缕 cardamom 的幻想——或许梦境入口就藏在下一个扫码动作里 🌸🌙✨
