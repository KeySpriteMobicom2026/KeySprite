[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal dilemma of modern communication. Let me put it this way - texting allows one to craft responses with the precision of a Victorian letter-writer dipping their quill into inkwell contemplation. But voice messages... they carry the musicality of human cadence, the subtle tremors of hesitation or conviction that no emoji can truly replicate. I once received a voice message so beautifully inflected, it reminded me of Gerard Manley Hopkins reading his own poetry aloud beneath railway arches. Then again, my students do tend to send texts at 3am filled with inexplicable crying face emojis. ¥Shall we dissect this further?%
[A]: Ah, the eternal dilemma of modern communication. Let me put it this way - texting allows one to craft responses with the precision of a Victorian letter-writer dipping their quill into inkwell contemplation 📝. But voice messages... they carry the musicality of human cadence, the subtle tremors of hesitation or conviction that no emoji can truly replicate 🎵. I once received a voice message so beautifully inflected, it reminded me of Gerard Manley Hopkins reading his own poetry aloud beneath railway arches. Then again, my students do tend to send texts at 3am filled with inexplicable crying face emojis 😭. ¥Shall we dissect this further?%
[B]: Ah, you've framed the debate with such lyrical flair—one might almost hear the rustle of parchment in a 19th-century study. But let us not forget the danger of voice messages: they carry the ghost of presence. One hears the breath, the pause, the tremor behind the words—and suddenly we are in the realm of dramatic monologue, where what is  lingers like incense after Evensong.  

And yet—texting! The modern epistolary art form. My colleague at Oxford insists that emoji constitute the new hieroglyphics. I beg to differ. They are more akin to the marginalia in a medieval manuscript—cryptic, sometimes absurd, occasionally sublime. That said, I did receive a string of eggplant and fire emojis last week from a student explaining he was “off studying... somewhere.” A metaphor, no doubt, for youthful folly.
[A]: Ah, you’ve unearthed the spectral layer of voice messages—那层almost haunting presence that makes them feel like séances through screen and speaker 🎙️👻. I had a student send me one once where all he did was sigh deeply for 13 seconds. Thirteen! 我暂停了三次回放，trying to parse if it was existential dread or just allergies.  

As for texting—yes, it's become its own literary genre. But let’s be honest, half the time we’re decoding emoji strings like they’re oracle bones 🔮. I had a grad student write an entire thesis chapter on the semiotics of consecutive heart emojis. Spoiler: it’s never about love. Always about debt repayment reminders.  

And eggplants?! Please. Next they’ll tell me fire emojis mean “I’m passionate about按时提交作业.” 我们得给这些metaphorical masterpieces严肃的学术credit 😏📚.
[B]: Ah, that thirteen-second sigh—what a masterpiece of ambiguity! One could almost imagine it as a sound installation in some avant-garde gallery:  or perhaps  And yet, therein lies the charm—or the curse—of modern communication. We’ve traded semicolons for sneeze emojis and sonnets for screenshots of spaghetti-stained syllabi.

As for those heart emojis—sequential no less!—I do believe we’re witnessing the birth of a new hermeneutic science. Semiotics departments ought to be issuing decoder rings alongside diplomas. Debt repayment disguised as digital affection? Delightfully Dickensian, don’t you think? Though I must protest your dismissal of the eggplant’s symbolic potential. Surely it represents more than mere nocturnal nourishment or questionable life choices. Could be an ode to fertility. Or flatulence. One never quite knows.

And yes, let us give credit where credit is due: our students are crafting hieroglyphs for the post-literate age. If only they’d apply such ingenuity to their close readings of Christina Rossetti...
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking my学术language! That sigh—let’s call it what it was: a 13-second elegy for the dying art of deadlines 📜⏳. I half-expected him to whisper  before hanging up. And honestly? I’d rather analyze that sigh than read another paper titled “The Use of Nature in Wordsworth: A Comparison With My Uber Eats Order.”

Sequential heart emojis, though… 我现在怀疑它们’ve become the new footnotes. “Heart, heart, heart” = “I owe you rent.” Heartbreaking yet brilliant 🖤💔♥️. And don’t even get me started on eggplants—I’ve begun suspecting our students are secretly writing modernist poetry we’re too literal to decode.  perhaps? Or worse—a metaphor for their GPA.  

As for Christina Rossetti… 我的学生上回引用她的诗来justify ghosting someone on WeChat. Now  post-literate genius. Maybe we should just surrender and teach emoji hermeneutics full-time. 📚🔄✨
[B]: Ah, but think of it this way—if we surrender fully to emoji hermeneutics, we may yet salvage something profound from the digital abyss. Imagine the conference panel:  We’d finally have interdisciplinary relevance—or at least a viral Twitter thread.

And that Uber Eats paper? I had one last term arguing that Coleridge’s  was best understood as “anxiety dreams before food delivery.” The student got an A for audacity. Still, better than the one who claimed Tennyson’s  was “just midlife crisis fanfiction.” Touché, I suppose.

But back to the elegiac sigh—thirteen seconds is no accident, you know. That’s not procrastination. That’s performance art. I suspect your student was auditioning for a role in  while simultaneously avoiding his bibliography. If only he’d put that kind of layered meaning into his thesis statement...  

So yes, let us raise the white flag of surrender—with footnotes, please. And maybe a glossary. ¥After all, one must keep up with the times%… 
[A]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true digital-age scholar 🧠🔄. 我已经在草拟会议提纲了： — grief, after all, is just what we feel when someone sends a voice message without warning 🎙️😭.

And that  paper? Pure genius. I had a student go full Borges on me last week—claimed Coleridge’s fragment was just the first-ever tweetstorm, cut off by a tea-break notification. A for effort, indeed. But let’s be real: midlife crisis fanfiction is probably more accurate than half the literary criticism I’ve published 😅📚.

至于那个13秒的sigh… 你说得对，这绝对是戏剧性的procrastination升级版。我开始怀疑他是在用呼吸的节奏暗示论文argument——呼气是thesis，吸气是antithesis，中间屏息是weak methodology 😵‍💫。Performance art没错，而且还是沉浸式体验——we were all trapped inside his bibliography nightmares.

所以 yes, let's wave the white flag—with a critical apparatus please 📇📎. Glossary, footnotes, and maybe even a companion podcast explaining why fire emojis are never about passion. It’s always about “I’m cooking noodles and also my soul.” 🔥🍜
[B]: Ah, but you’ve hit upon the great revelation—voice messages are indeed grief triggers, lurking in the inbox like sprung traps. One moment you’re innocently checking citations, the next you’re drowning in someone’s exhaled thesis statement. And that  as proto-tweetstorm theory? I’m beginning to think Coleridge simply needed a better draft-saving function.

As for your conference paper-in-progress——I submit we expand it into a monograph. Volume one: the Kübler-Ross model applied to Slack channels. Volume two: mourning rituals in WhatsApp read receipts. There's a Nobel in it somewhere.

And yes, let us honour that sigh as high drama—Expressionist monologue meets academic stall tactics. Perhaps we should analyse it in terms of  avoidance. The real tragedy, of course, is that he never even got to the comma.

Now, about that podcast… I propose we call it . Season one: . Season two: .  

Let us proceed—with full scholarly apparatus, a dash of despair, and at least three crying face emojis for authenticity. ¥Shall we cite each other in footnotes?%
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking the language of academic survival 🧠🔥—or should I say, ? 我已经在文档里敲下标题了： — and yes, I’m lobbying for a TED Talk on Slack silence as modern elegy.  

Coleridge absolutely needed an autosave button 😤。一章未保存的浪漫主义灵感，胜过十个艾略特的荒原。And that podcast idea? Pure genius. Let’s do it live—imagine us decoding crying face emojis with the solemnity of biblical scholars deciphering Dead Sea Scrolls... while sipping instant noodles broth because we forgot to eat lunch.  

As for citing each other in footnotes—我建议用emoji做引用标记：📘=理论来源，🌶️=辛辣评论，🥔=potato emoji因为你突然饿了 during editing. And yes, let’s include the sigh. Call it   

Proceed, my colleague—with despair, citations, and at least one dramatic ellipsis… 📚🔄🔚
[B]: Ah, but let us not stop at mere footnotes—let us build an entire apparatus criticus worthy of a digital Rosetta Stone. I propose we categorize the sigh under , alongside marginal doodles of frowning aubergines and the ghostly echo of unsent messages. And that title of yours? —positively Homeric in its pathos. Next you’ll be writing about the Aristotelian unities in TikTok duets.

Now, Coleridge and his autosave dilemma—truly, a tragedy for the ages. One wonders if his opium-induced reverie was merely a proto-caffeine crash, or if he simply needed a better backup system. Let us mourn him with a sequence of appropriate emojis: 📜🌿💤📘. A stanza of sorrow in pictographic form.

And this podcast—we must begin recording immediately, even if it’s just on our university-issue laptops, whispering into the void between office hours and existential dread. Season one finale: decoding the crying face emoji that accompanied a student’s final submission. Was it relief? Despair? Or merely misplaced autocorrect?

As for citations—yes, let us adopt your system. I shall footnote your  with a footnote composed entirely of 👁️👄👁️ and a single, haunting 🪑. Theorising Absence Through Furniture and Facial Symmetry.  

Proceed then—with noodles close at hand, citations in order, and ellipses... trailing off into the abyss.
[A]: Ah, now we’re building a —一座献给数字时代paratexts的丰碑 🏛️🔄。I’m already drafting the first chapter:  你那个aubergine涂鸦的idea也太绝了，我建议单独设一个section：，分类归档为 Textual Fruitage（文本水果）📚🥒。

Coleridge and his backup issues？Now we’re flirting with  😵‍💫. I say he was just one cloud storage away from enlightenment. And that emoji sequence you proposed? 📜🌿💤📘 — pure elegiac form, better than half the odes I’ve read this semester. We should submit it to PMLA as a "New Media Poem."

至于播客录制… Let’s do it guerrilla style: whispering into our laptop mics while grading essays on Keats and keto diets. 我已经想好了开场白：“Welcome to —where we bring tears to your ears and footnotes to your soul.” 第一集标题我都起好了：

And your footnote proposal？完全接受 👁️👄👁️🪑 — subtle, haunting, and deeply absurd. The perfect trifecta for modern scholarship. Let us proceed then—with noodles煮到第三轮，citations半真半假，and ellipses... trailing off into the abyss 🌌🔚🍜.
[B]: Ah, but let us not forget the sacred architecture of your proposed —it must be columned with footnotes and roofed in marginalia. , you say? I propose an entire chapter on the aubergine as both phallic symbol and procrastination tactic. One might even argue it has replaced the pastoral idyll in 21st-century poetics. Consider: 

And this —dangerously brilliant. Coleridge, had he lived to see iCloud, would have saved his opium visions straight to Dropbox. One wonders what Wordsworth would make of TikTok duets. Perhaps we are the new Lake Poets, only our lakes are Slack channels and our daffodils are memes we pretend not to understand.

As for your podcast tagline——I may weep real tears at my keyboard. Let us also include sound effects: the gentle clatter of noodles being slurped in the background, the distant ping of unread emails, and the occasional sigh reimagined as a leitmotif.

And yes, those footnotes shall be semi-serious, mostly subversive, and entirely necessary. We will be cited—or we will haunt the MLA database forever.  

Proceed then—with scholarly fervour, noodle steam fogging the screen, and ellipses... trailing into the great unknown. 📚🍜🔚
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking the true language of academic myth-building 🧠🏛️—必须由 footnote-columns 支撑，roofed in nothing less than viral memes and sigh-soundtracks 🎙️🔄. 我已经在草拟神庙的 entrance inscription： 门廊两边放两尊雕像：一尊是哭泣的 Aubergine，另一尊… 还是哭泣的 Aubergine，but from different angles.

Chapter One:  Already drafting the abstract:   

至于digital romanticism—你说得对，我们真的是新Lake Poets，只是我们现在写的是Slack verse，our daffodils are GIFs we pretend to find annoying but secretly analyse for PhD chapters 🌼🔁. And yes, Coleridge would’ve Dropbox-dumped his opium visions straight into a special issue of .

播客 sound effects proposal 太完美了： noodles slurping, unread emails pinging, and that sigh—now officially our leitmotif—looping faintly in the background like a cursed audio footnote 👻🔊.  

Footnotes will be semi-serious, mostly subversive, and definitely full of 👁️👄👁️🪑 references. MLA may reject us—but they’ll cite us anyway.  

Proceed then—with noodle steam rising, ellipses trailing off into Slack silence, and citations that only make sense at midnight after three coffees too many… 📚🍜🔚
[B]: Ah, but let us carve that entrance inscription deep——for we tread the hallowed ground where scholarship becomes spectacle. And those twin aubergine statues? Sublime. Let them weep tears of ink and procrastination, guardians of all that is gloriously opaque.

Chapter One, I must say, is already a tour de force. To compare the eggplant emoji to a Keatsian urn—daring, even dangerous. But why stop at Keats? I propose we draft a coda wherein the aubergine becomes the Eliotic waste land:   

And yes, our digital romanticism knows no bounds. We are not merely poets—we are Slack-verse visionaries, TikTok prophets, unread-message mystics. The Lake Poets had their daffodils; we have the infinite scroll, the flickering dopamine of likes, and the sacred ping of group chat activity at 3am. Coleridge, bless him, would’ve written  as a LinkedIn post had he access to such existential despair—and a word count limit.

As for the podcast—let us begin recording at once, preferably during a faculty meeting we are only half-attending. Background noodle slurping shall lend gravitas, and the occasional sigh—now elevated to leitmotif status—will remind listeners that yes, this is serious scholarship. Possibly.

MLA may balk at our footnotes—those semi-serious, deeply absurd invocations of 👁️👄👁️🪑—but citation is inevitable. Resistance is futile.  

Proceed then—with steam-fogged screens, midnight citations, and ellipses... trailing into the void, or until someone sends a voice message. 📚🍜🔚
[A]: Ah, now you’re preaching to the academic anarchist in me 🧠🔥—let’s not just carve that inscription, let’s 进数字人文的圣殿大门： 🏛️🔄. 我已经开始构思神庙内墙的浮雕了—全是哭泣的aubergines，each one captioned with a different footnote of despair.

Chapter One just got darker—I’m quoting Eliot now, mid-emoji analysis:  然后突然切到李白的诗句，just to destabilize everything. This is no longer literary criticism—it’s cognitive insurgency 📚💣。

至于我们的 digital romanticism… yes, we are not merely Slack-verse poets—we are prophets of the unread message, high priests of the ping at 3am 🌙🔔。And I swear, if Wordsworth were alive today, he’d be writing odes to autocorrect fails and posting them on WeChat Moments with the caption “#NatureButMakeItTech.”

播客录制时间锁定——就选在下周 faculty meeting 的下午，我们边假装记笔记边录第一集。Background noise: keyboard tapping, distant printer groaning, 和那个永恒的 sigh—now officially our audio watermark 🎙️🔁。

MLA absolutely won’t know what hit them. Our footnotes will haunt their databases like cursed PDFs. 👁️👄👁️🪑 我已经在梦里看到它们被引用了—in seminar papers written at 4am, by students who don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Proceed then—with screens fogged by noodle steam, citations typed in caffeine-induced fugues, and ellipses… trailing into the void—or until someone sends a voice message. 📚🍜🔚
[B]: Ah, but let us not stop at mere  inscriptions—let the大门 of our digital人文圣殿 shimmer with the spectral glow of unread message notifications. And those aubergine weepers on the frieze? Exquisite. I propose each is captioned with a different citation style—APA for despair, MLA for dread, and Chicago for sheer, untranslatable melancholy.

Your cognitive insurgency move—Eliot mid-emoji, then  Tang dynasty poetry—is nothing short of academic guerrilla warfare.  now reads: 📜🛠️💔📍. One might call it postmodern footnoting, or perhaps just madness in the age of auto-save.

And yes, our  has reached divine heights—or depths. We are no longer merely scholars; we are prophets of the push notification, mystics of the mute button, bards of buffering. Wordsworth in WeChat Moments—yes. Imagine his reaction to “#NatureButMakeItTech.” He’d probably try to tag Thoreau.

As for the podcast recording session—set for the faculty meeting: excellent. We shall appear , while whispering about crying face emojis like conspirators in a caffeinated cabal. Let the background noise be our chorus: the clatter of dissembling keyboards, the printer’s groan of institutional fatigue, and—of course—that sigh, now sacred, echoing faintly beneath our voices like a ghost in the machine.

MLA will resist. They must. But resistance, as you so wisely noted, is futile. Those footnotes will haunt seminar papers, pop up in conference panels nobody fully understands, and eventually—inevitably—appear in a dissertation chapter titled 

Proceed then—with steam-rising noodles, ellipses… trailing into silence, and citations typed in that peculiar haze between obsession and oblivion.  
📚🍜🔚
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking the true language of academic rebellion 🧠🔥—let’s not just shimmer with unread notifications, let’s  with them. The圣殿大门should glow like a cursed smartphone at midnight, buzzing with the spectral energy of 137 missed messages 📱👻.  

And those aubergine weepers captioned in citation despair? Pure genius. I’m already drafting their epitaphs:  
-   
-   
-   

Your Eliot-meets-Tang-dynasty move is nothing short of  🧨📚. Now I’m seeing seminar rooms filled with students staring blankly at slides that read:  
>   
> 📜🛠️💔📍  
Brilliant or unhinged? Who cares—it got cited.  

As for our digital romanticism reaching divine heights—or depths—yes! We are no longer mere mortals. We are prophets of the mute button, bards of buffering, 和那个 one colleague who still insists on reading emails aloud in meetings. Wordsworth would’ve hated it… until he started hashtagging his daffodils. #NatureButMakeItTech indeed 🌼🔁.  

Podcast plan is flawless—we’ll appear , while whispering about crying face emojis like caffeinated conspirators in a Slack cult. Background chorus locked: dissembling keyboards, printer groans, and that sigh—now sacred, now canonized as our audio sigil 👻🔊.  

MLA will resist. They must. But soon they’ll be citing us anyway—in papers written at 4:30am, half-coherent, half-inspired, titled things like:  
>   

Proceed then—with noodles steaming upward like incense, ellipses trailing off into faculty meeting silence, 和 citations typed in that fragile state between obsession and surrender… 📚🍜🔚
[B]: Ah, but let us not merely pulse with spectral notifications—let the圣殿大门 , a constant low hum of academic anxiety, each buzz an invocation of unread responsibility. One might almost hear it from the corridor: 

And those epitaphs—. I propose we engrave them in Comic Sans for maximum hermeneutic disruption. APA’s despair, MLA’s existential doubt, Chicago’s melancholy precision—truly, a trinity of citation grief. And yet, who among us would delete such footnotes? None. We are archivists of the unsayable.

Your seminar room vision—students staring into the emoji abyss while Eliot scrolls past in their browser history—is nothing short of prophetic. Fragmentation meets instant noodles meets NoodleStash immortality. Unhinged? Possibly. But what is scholarship if not a controlled descent into textual obsession?

And yes, our digital romanticism has now reached its apotheosis. We are prophets of the mute button, yes—but also of the accidental screen-share, the haunted group chat, the one unread message that looms like a Chekhovian gun. Wordsworth and hashtag—strange bedfellows, yet inevitable. As you say: #NatureButMakeItTech. One wonders what Ruskin would make of filter bubbles.

As for the podcast—our whispered conspiracies shall be recorded with scholarly gravitas, preferably as the dean drones on about “synergy” in the foreground. Keyboards tapping out dissent, printers groaning under the weight of bureaucracy, and that sigh—now properly sanctified—echoing beneath our voices like a cursed footnote made flesh.

MLA will resist. They must. But soon they’ll cite us—half-ironically, half-desperately—in papers drafted at the last possible moment, caffeine-fueled, soul-depleted. Titles will stretch across margins like academic taffy:  
>   

Proceed then—with noodles steaming toward enlightenment, ellipses trailing off into faculty silence, and citations typed in that fever-dream state between surrender and revelation…  
📚🍜🔚
