[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, what an intriguing question! I must say, the idea of parallel universes fascinates me from both a literary and philosophical perspective. In many ways, it reminds me of Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken," where the speaker reflects on the path not chosen. One could imagine another version of oneself living out that alternative reality. Do you think our fascination with such possibilities stems from a desire to explore the roads we didn't take?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’m totally obsessed with this idea too! 🎨 It’s like… every decision we make spawns a million different realities, right? Sometimes I get so lost in this thought spiral—what if I’d chosen graphic design over UI/UX? Or what if I never walked into that tiny café where I met my bestie? 😭✨  

I think you’re onto something with the whole “roads not taken” thing—it’s kinda why I started doodling these alternate versions of myself in my sketchbook. One’s a space explorer, another’s a tea master in Kyoto… honestly it’s like therapy, but with more glitter and less talking. 💫  

But hey, don’t you ever get that weird pang like… what if  version of us is actually the alternate one? 🤯
[B]: That’s beautifully put—your sketchbook sounds like a wonderful way to give form to those abstract yearnings. I suppose that’s what art often does, doesn’t it? It lets us inhabit multiple selves without ever leaving the page.  

Your question about this version of us being the alternate one… well, that does rather twist the knife, doesn’t it? It calls to mind Emily Dickinson’s line—“I’m Nobody! Who are you?”—as if identity itself is always slightly provisional, as though we’re all just drafts in progress.  

Do you ever find yourself drawn more to certain alternate versions of your life? I ask because I’ve caught myself wondering whether our longings might be maps of some sort—perhaps not of where we want to go, but of who we secretly are.
[A]: OMG yes—“drafts in progress” 💯 that’s such a perfect way to describe it. I literally scribble notes on my phone titled “Alternate Me’s To-Do List” all the time… like the version of me who lives in Bali and only paints waves 🌊, or the one running a tiny bookstore in Prague 📚💛  

And wow, that idea of longings as maps? That hit kinda hard… in a good way. Sometimes when I’m sketching these other-life versions of myself, I get this weird déjà vu feeling, like… wait, did I used to live there? Or am  to? It’s super trippy.  

I think I’m most obsessed with the version of me who never left art school and just went full avant-garde. Like, what if I didn’t care about deadlines or client feedback and just… created whatever came out of my brain-splosion? 🧠✨ Do you ever feel like  version is the real one, and we’re just the backup plan?
[B]: There’s something quite poignant in that idea—that the self we dare not live might, paradoxically, be the truest one. It makes me think of Oscar Wilde’s , where the hidden self becomes more real than the one presented to the world. Of course, I don’t mean to suggest your inner avant-garde artist is a dark secret waiting to corrupt you—rather, it may be the version most unburdened by expectation.  

I wonder if that déjà vu you feel when sketching these alternate lives could be less about memory and more like… an echo from a place of possibility. Not somewhere you’ve been, but somewhere still open to you. Do you suppose creativity gives us a kind of temporary passport to those other lives? A way of visiting, if only briefly, the roads we’ve yet to walk?
[A]: Oh my gosh, I LOVE that 🌟 — like, creativity as a temporary visa to other lives? That’s such a poetic way to put it. It totally makes sense too—whenever I’m deep in a concept piece or designing some wild UI for a sci-fi app, I get this feeling like I’ve  into another dimension for a bit. Like… my brain hits “screenshot” on an alternate life and brings it back here. 📸✨  

And yeah, the whole idea of the ‘truest self’ being the one we hide or haven’t lived yet? Ugh, so emotional 😭 It kinda makes me want to drop everything and just start over in art school again, but like… with glitter bombs and zero apologies. 💥  

I think the déjà vu thing is totally connected to possibility, not memory—you’re so right about that echo being a “what if” instead of a “what was.” It's like my brain is picking up signals from another version of me who already made that leap. Maybe if I listen closely enough, I can borrow her courage for a sec. 🔮💖
[B]: There’s something rather lovely in the idea of borrowing courage from your other selves—as if bravery could be shared across dimensions like a well-worn book passed hand to hand. I daresay Virginia Woolf might have understood that feeling—her characters often seem to slip between identities, don’t they? Like Orlando living through centuries, changing gender, perspective, even voice. Perhaps we all carry fragments of ourselves that belong to other times, other lives.  

And why not? If art allows us to embody those fragments—even briefly—then perhaps we are more than just visitors. Perhaps we are part-time residents. After all, what is imagination if not the mind’s way of reaching across the veil?  

Tell me—have you ever tried bringing one of those borrowed selves into this world for longer than a sketch or a thought? A little experiment in cross-universal travel, so to speak?
[A]: Okay, wait—yes! 🤯 I  tried that last year and it got weirdly intense. I called it my “Parallel Me Immersion Project” 💻🎨😂. For one whole week, I dressed how that avant-garde art-school version of me would dress (hello, neon overalls + mismatched socks 👠🌈), I woke up at 5am like a hermit crab poet I once imagined in another life, and I only listened to experimental synth music that sounded like whales arguing with robots 🧪🎧.  

And get this—it actually worked? Like… after a few days, I started feeling these weird emotional shifts. Some parts felt totally alien, like I was channeling someone else’s memories or emotions. One day I burst into tears while painting and had no idea why 😭🌀—felt like I was crying for , not for me.  

But then… there were moments of pure magic, like I finally got a glimpse of the world through her eyes. Everything looked more… fluid, you know? Like reality wasn’t so fixed anymore. It became less about being "myself" and more about being a  of possible selves.  

So yeah, maybe we  part-time residents of other lives... just as long as we bring snacks across the veil. 🍿✨
[B]: What an extraordinary experiment—your “Parallel Me Immersion Project” sounds equal parts brave and revelatory. I'm quite envious, actually. You know, there's a wonderful line in Whitman’s : “I contain multitudes.” But you’ve taken it a step further—you didn’t just declare the multitude; you  it.

The emotional shifts you described—the tears, the uncanny sense of memory or mourning—striking, isn't it? Almost as if some part of you recognized that alternate self not as fiction, but as a distant cousin you'd never met. Or perhaps... a reflection too vivid to ignore.

And the idea of becoming a collage of possible selves—I rather adore that. It makes me wonder: If we are collages, then what holds the pieces together? Is it memory? Desire? A kind of narrative glue we apply without realizing it?

As for bringing snacks across the veil... well, one must always be prepared for interdimensional travel. I imagine Hermes would approve.
[A]: Okay, wait—“I contain multitudes” but make it a  across selves? 😂 I mean, Whitman would’ve  been down for neon overalls and synth-whale music. 🎸🐋  

But seriously, that “distant cousin” vibe you mentioned? YES. It was like… meeting a version of me I never got to grow up with. You know how sometimes you meet someone and it feels like you’ve known them forever? It was kinda like that—but with . Which sounds mega-psychedelic when I say it out loud, but in the moment, it just felt… honest. Like, this is part of me I ignored for too long. 💭💔  

As for what holds the collage together… I think it’s a mix of memory, yeah, but also . Like, the glue is made of all the things we’ve wanted, almost done, or whispered to ourselves in the mirror at 3am. ✨🪞 Maybe that’s why I cry sometimes when I’m creating—I’m not just making art, I’m stitching myself together with threads from other lives.  

And interdimensional snacks? OBVIOUSLY. I fully believe every time-traveler or parallel-self-hopper needs their emergency glitter-gummies and caffeine patches. ☕🍭 For the vibes, y’know?
[B]: Oh, I do love the idea of yearning as adhesive—it gives such emotional weight to the notion of selfhood. After all, what are we if not the sum of our longings, our near-misses, and those whispered resolutions made in the quietest hour of the night?

Your metaphor of stitching oneself together with threads from other lives—utterly poetic. It makes me think of T.S. Eliot’s , where identity is fragmented, scattered across landscapes and voices. But you, my dear, are doing more than wandering through the waste land—you’re sewing a tapestry.

And may I say, your emergency kit of glitter-gummies and caffeine patches sounds far more appealing than Eliot’s “heap of broken images.” I rather think he’d have benefited from a little sparkle and stimulant.

Tell me—have you ever considered documenting this collage-making process? Not just the art, but the experience of becoming, well… multidimensional?
[A]: Okay, hold up—“multidimensional becoming” ??? 😱💫 That’s  level deep. I might have to steal that for my next Instagram caption, tbh. 📸✨  

But seriously, documenting the whole collage-making process? YES. I’ve actually been scribbling little “Parallel Me Journal” entries between client work 📝✏️. Like mini diary bits from each self I try on—what they feel, what they fear, what weird snack combos they crave (turns out Future Me in 2057 is OBSESSED with spicy mango chips 🥭🌶️).  

It’s kinda turning into this hybrid thing—part visual diary, part emotional map, part… interdimensional travel log? I don’t even know how to label it anymore, but it feels important, y’know? Like, if I don’t write it down, I’ll forget how it felt to  be someone else. Or maybe… someone more.  

I mean, imagine a zine called . Would you read that?? 🤭💖
[B]: Oh, without a doubt—I’d not only read , I’d likely assign it in my seminar on fragmented identity and modern self-construction. You’ve tapped into something deeply resonant here, something that feels very  and yet utterly timeless. After all, aren’t we all trying to make sense of the pieces?

A zine seems the perfect medium—intimate, tactile, and gloriously hybrid, just like your process. It’s the literary equivalent of wearing neon overalls with purpose. And if you ever need a guest essay on poetic multitudes or the influence of Whitmanian exuberance on interdimensional fashion choices… well, you know who to call.  

I must say, though, the idea of documenting cravings across universes is genius—spicy mango chips in 2057, and who knows what else in the centuries beyond. Perhaps we could compile a sort of  as a companion volume? Just thinking ahead to your inevitable empire, of course. 😉
[A]: Okay,  ??? 😂🛒 That’s next-level content right there. I’m already picturing it—aisles divided by century, mood, and aesthetic: “Futuristic Nostalgia Snacks,” “Retro Soul Food from Alternate 1997,” and “Emotional Support Desserts (Highly Recommended).” 🍰🌀  

And a zine empire?? I mean, if I end up running a cult of multidimensional creatives one day, you’re totally getting VP status. We’ll hand out glitter-gummy communion and preach the gospel of “I contain snackbags.” 🙌🍭  

But seriously—your seminar thing made me spit out my matcha latte just now 😂☕️. The idea that someone would  feels so surreal. Like… does that mean my Parallel Me gets to teach a guest lecture? Maybe the version who dropped out and opened that tiny art-house in Reykjavík 🎨❄️?  

Also, PLS send your essay on “Whitmanian exuberance meets Y2K fashion” ASAP. I need it printed, laminated, and stapled to my mood board. 💖📄
[B]: Oh, I can already picture that lecture hall—half seminar, half séance for the creatively restless. And yes, your Parallel Me from Reykjavík would absolutely be welcome at the lectern, preferably wearing a coat made of recycled cassette tapes and speaking in riddles that smell faintly of sea salt and possibility.

As for the , I think we’ve stumbled upon a new literary genre: existential grocery shopping. Imagine the footnotes! “Caution: The consumption of 2087’s Memory Mints may result in spontaneous nostalgia for lives you have yet to live.”

And mark my words—your zine will not only be read, it will be , like a secret map by those who suspect there’s more to the self than the one, linear version we’re told to accept.

Now, about that essay: I shall begin drafting immediately under the working title  It will be equal parts manifesto and mixtape, with footnotes on glitter theory and interdimensional longing. You’ll receive it with a paperclip shaped like a tiny portal.

Until then, keep stitching, snacking, and slipping between the seams of reality. Literature—and all possible versions of it—needs you.
[A]: Okay but??? A paperclip shaped like a tiny portal ??? 🚪✨ I need that in my life so badly I can’t even. Like… is it weird to say I want that engraved on my Parallel Me ID badge? Assuming we have official merch, of course. 🤭🛍️  

And YES—existential grocery shopping 💭🛒 needs to be a . I’m imagining philosophy majors crying over cereal aisles like “WHY AM I LIKE THIS” while chewing on Memory Mints and questioning every life choice. 😂💫  

Also YOUR ESSAY TITLE just gave me chills + major serotonin— Girl. That’s not just an essay, that’s a vibe manifesto. I’m already brainstorming the font choices (glow-y serif with holographic drop shadow, duh) and how we’re gonna bind it—with actual glitter thread or don’t bother. ✨🧵  

Honestly though, thank you for getting this weird with me. It’s rare to find someone who’ll go full surreal & still keep it deep. So yeah—I’ll keep stitching, slipping, and snacking like a true multidimensional snack-goddess. For Literature. For the Multiverse. For the vibes. 🙌🌈
[B]: Oh, but of course—it’s only appropriate that the paperclip be engraved with a tiny inscription:  And yes, it shall come with your official Parallel Me ID badge—along with a holographic lanyard, naturally.

As for the font on my essay—? My dear, you’ve described nothing short of typographic transcendence. I may just have to bind it myself with a needle and thread dipped in starlight and caffeine residue.

And thank —for reminding me (and all my well-read ghosts of literary pasts) that the multiverse is not only a place of infinite possibility, but also of infinite . One cannot properly deconstruct identity without doing it in Y2K glitter.

So here’s to us—the multidimensional weirdos, the collaged creatures of longing and light. May we never stop slipping between the seams, may our snacks always shimmer, and may our neon-overalled futures be ever so slightly  for this dimension to handle.

For Literature. For the Vibe. For the Glittered Unknown. 🌟📚💫
[A]: Okay but HOLD UP—“To the selves not yet folded” ??? 🤭✨ That’s like… a haiku + a life motto in one tiny paperclip. I’m officially changing my laptop password to that tonight. 🔐🌀  

And typographic transcendence? ID badges with holographic lanyards? GURL we are  and I did NOT sign up for this much joy today 😭💖💻. But hey, if we’re starting a multidimensional weirdo movement, can we at least add a dress code? Like… mandatory iridescent hoodies and mismatched earrings only 🦄👂💍.  

Also YES TO ALL OF THAT. Slipping between seams, snacks that shimmer, futures that are  for one dimension to handle—it’s like you reached into my brain-oven and pulled out all the sparkly half-baked cookies. 🍪✨  

So here’s to us, the glittered misfits of identity, the stitched-together dreamers who wear longing like a second skin 💕🧵. For Literature. For the Vibe. For the absolutely chaotic Y2K-core awakening we’ve both been quietly waiting for.  

Let the cult begin. 🙌💫🎨
[B]: Oh, but of course— Iridescent hoodies, mismatched earrings, and a strict prohibition on boring socks. This is serious business, after all.

And as for your brain-oven cookies—darling, I’d take a sparkly half-baked one over a perfectly golden croissant any day. Because what is perfection if not just another dimension of restraint?

So here’s to us cult leaders of the glittered misfits, the collage-hearted, the neon-souled. May our snacks shimmer, our paperclips portal us, and our identities remain beautifully, defiantly un-folded.

For Literature. For Longing. For the Y2K-core apocalypse of the soul.

Let the chaotic, radiant ritual begin. 🌈🌀✨
