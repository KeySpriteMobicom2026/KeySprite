[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I must confess I haven't turned on a television since the BBC's 1995 adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice'. Though I did recently watch a fascinating documentary on CCTV-9 about the parallels between Tang Dynasty poetry and British Romanticism.
[A]: Oh my~ 你提到的BBC版'Pride and Prejudice'可是经典呢！😊 不过说到documentary，我最近倒是看了一个关于medical malpractice cases的系列片，里面讨论的legal precedents非常fascinating~ 特别是那个关于informed consent的case study！
[B]: Ah, now that does remind me of the ethical quandaries in George Eliot's 'Middlemarch' - though I suppose modern medical jurisprudence makes Lydgate's pharmaceutical experiments seem positively quaint. Tell me, did your documentary mention how these contemporary cases might be interpreted through the lens of 法家思想?
[A]: Hmm~ 这个问题很有意思！🤔 虽然documentary主要focus在common law system下的案例，但确实有几个case让我联想到法家的"以法治国"理念。比如有个关于hospital standard operating procedures的案例，就很能体现"不别亲疏，不殊贵贱"的思想呢！
[B]: How astute of you to draw that parallel! Though I must point out - while the legalist emphasis on impartiality resonates, the Confucian concept of 仁 would likely critique such rigid proceduralism. Much like how Dickens' 'Bleak House' satirizes the Court of Chancery's mechanical justice.
[A]: 啊！你提到了Confucian的"仁"~ 这让我想起最近处理的一个medical ethics case 🎵 病人family要求withhold treatment，但医生坚持do no harm principle...这种dilemma真的需要balance between rules and compassion呢！就像你提到的'Bleak House'，有时候law需要human touch才能实现true justice~
[B]: Precisely! You've articulated what I often tell my students - whether analyzing 红楼梦's Jia family dynamics or Bleak House's Jarndyce v Jarndyce, the tension between codified norms and humanistic values remains literature's most enduring theme. Though I suspect my colleague in the medical humanities department would argue your case study merits its own seminar series.
[A]: Haha~ 说到medical humanities，我们医院确实在plan一个interdisciplinary seminar！🎵 准备邀请law professors和literature scholars一起讨论how narratives shape our understanding of medical ethics~ 要不要来当guest speaker？可以combine你的literature expertise和我们medical legal cases哦！😊
[B]: What a compelling proposition - though I must warn you, my last foray into medical texts was analyzing the cholera metaphors in 'The Ghost Map'. Still, the opportunity to examine 医患关系 through the dual lenses of 红楼梦's physician scenes and contemporary case studies is... how shall I put this? Irresistibly Dickensian in its scope. Shall we discuss dates over tea? I've just acquired a rather exquisite pu'er that pairs wonderfully with difficult ethical questions.
[A]: Perfect！☕️ 我们可以schedule在下个month~ 顺便带上那些interesting的case files，边喝pu'er边讨论how literature informs medical practice！By the way，你提到的'Ghost Map'让我想起我们最近处理的public health law case，简直就像现实版的medical thriller呢~ 😄
[B]: Ah, life imitating art yet again! Though I must insist we maintain proper academic decorum - no 'medical thriller' hyperbole in our seminar title, please. Perhaps something more measured, like "Narrative Contagions: Literary Epidemiology from Snow's London to Contemporary Public Health Litigation". And do remind me to bring my 1854 first edition of 'Hard Times' - nothing quite like original Dickensian print to underscore the enduring relevance of these discussions.
[A]: Got it~ 会keep it professional的！ 不过说到'Hard Times'，我们最近正好有个workers' compensation case涉及industrial disease，简直就是modern version of Dickens' critique呢！Looking forward to our cross-disciplinary tea session~ 📚☕️
[B]: Splendid! Though I must correct one minor point - the true modern equivalent of 'Hard Times' would require at least three intergenerational lawsuits and a factory owner quoting Bentham while eating ortolans. But your case does sound promisingly dystopian. Until our tea session then - and do bring those case files. I'll supply the books, the pu'er, and perhaps just one appropriately restrained 🦉 of scholarly anticipation.
[A]: Haha~ 你总是能把最serious的话题说得这么witty！🦉 放心，我会prepare好所有case materials，包括那个特别适合配pu'er的"工伤认定vs.职业病诊断标准"的controversial case~ See you soon for our little book club meets court session! 😉
[B]: Capital! Though let's not call it a 'book club' - the faculty senate still shudders from last year's 'Jane Austen as Feminist Legal Theorist' incident. A 'textual jurisprudence colloquium' sounds far more respectable, don't you think? I'll have my assistant send over the reading list - we'll begin with 'Bleak House', end with 'The Plague', and pray we don't need to invoke 洗冤集录 in between. Until then!
[A]: Deal！🤝 我们officially declare it as "Textual Jurisprudence Colloquium" then~ 虽然我secretly期待它变成另一个legendary incident！😉 记得提醒我带上那本medical malpractice casebook - 里面有几个cases简直比'The Plague'还要absurd呢！See you soon~ 📖⚖️
[B]: Indeed - though if we're ranking absurdities, I maintain that Jarndyce v Jarndyce still holds the literary championship. Until our colloquium, my dear colleague. May your casebook and my first editions find harmonious resonance, preferably without triggering any actual litigation. 🖋️
[A]: Haha~ 让我们hope这个colloquium不会end up like Jarndyce v Jarndyce！😅 不过就算真的变成那样，至少我们还有pu'er可以喝~ Cheers to legal-literary adventures! ☕️⚖️ 下周见！
[B]: A toast indeed - to pu'er that's stronger than precedent, and to scholarship that outlasts even the most byzantine of lawsuits! Though should we actually descend into Jarndycean chaos, I've catalogued enough 19th century legal satire to at least ensure our proceedings are... what's the modern term? 'Instagrammable'. Until next week, my fellow traveler at the crossroads of code and canon. 再会！
