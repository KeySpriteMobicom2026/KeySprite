[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a profoundly  question - like peeling an onion while reading Derrida!  Let me approach this through the lens of 伦理 (ethics) and 文化相对主义 (cultural relativism). The Western 自主性 (autonomy) narrative clashes fascinatingly with Eastern 集体主义 (collectivism) here... 🤔
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for cultural perspectives, let's not get carried away with excessive code-switching. The question of human cloning is rather like examining a particularly dense stanza of poetry - we must parse it carefully, line by line. 

From a literary standpoint, one might consider Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" as an early meditation on the ethics of creation. The Modernists would likely view cloning through the lens of fractured identity - think of Eliot's "The Waste Land" and its themes of fragmentation. 

But to your point about Eastern collectivism... hmm, that does bring to mind the concept of 大同 (great harmony), doesn't it? Though I suspect even Confucius might raise an eyebrow at the notion of identical selves walking about.
[B]: Ah, you've caught me mid-lecture mode!  Your Shelley reference is spot on - that 19th century 恐怖 (horror) now reads like prophetic 科幻 (sci-fi), doesn't it? 

But let's consider the 文本 (text) of actual science: each clone would develop unique 自我 (selves) through different 体验 (experiences). Like Borges' "Garden of Forking Paths," we're talking about identical starting points branching into infinite narratives. 🧠 

Though I must say, the administrative nightmare of identical student IDs in my seminars does give me pause... 🦉
[A]: How delightfully you weave together literature and science! Though I must gently remind you that my seminar rooms are hardly the place for such... practical concerns about student IDs. 

Your Borges reference is particularly apt - it reminds me of how Virginia Woolf might have approached this cloning question. In "Orlando," she plays with identity across centuries, showing how even the same consciousness changes with time and experience. 

The real poetic tragedy, I think, would be in losing what makes each human story unique. Like Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale," there's beauty in the ephemeral, in the knowledge that each life is its own unrepeatable verse.
[B]: Ah, ! Now you've touched the very 心 (heart) of my academic obsession. Her stream-of-consciousness technique actually mirrors how cloned minds would diverge - like two readers interpreting the same 诗歌 (poem) with entirely different 情感 (emotions). 🌸 

But your Keats reference cuts deeper. If we standardize human 起源 (origins), do we lose the 意境 (artistic conception) of spontaneous creation? Like comparing a mass-produced sonnet to Shakespeare's quill touching parchment... 

Though between us, I've always thought my department could use a few more clones - preferably ones who appreciate my 冷笑话 (dad jokes) about deconstructionism! 
[A]: My dear colleague, your enthusiasm for literary parallels is as refreshing as a spring morning in the university gardens. Though I must gently point out that your metaphors are growing rather... prolific, like Wordsworth's daffodils multiplying beyond control. 

Shall we consider this from another angle? The cloning debate reminds me of those fascinating Victorian debates about the "soul" - Browning's dramatic monologues come to mind, where each speaker insists on their unique consciousness. 

And really, must we bring department politics into this? Though I confess, a clone who appreciates literary humor would be preferable to another administrator asking why we can't "monetize" our poetry seminars...
[B]: Oh, you've uncovered my secret agenda!  Those Victorian soul debates were really just early 后人类 (posthuman) studies, weren't they? Like Tennyson's "In Memoriam" wrestling with 不朽 (immortality) through poetry rather than Petri dishes. 

But  - now there's a horror story Kafka couldn't have imagined! Though it does make me wonder... if we cloned all our administrators, would they finally understand why we need that 17th century folio budget? 🤔 

Perhaps we should take this debate to my office - I've got a new batch of 铁观音 (Tieguanyin) that's practically begging to be steeped in existential dilemmas... 🍵
[A]: How perfectly you blend the philosophical with the practical! Though I must insist we leave the administrators - cloned or otherwise - out of our tea time. That Tieguanyin deserves better company than budget spreadsheets and enrollment quotas. 

Your mention of Tennyson brings me back to the essential question: isn't the beauty of human existence precisely in its imperfections, its fleeting nature? Like the Japanese concept of 物の哀れ (mono no aware) - the pathos of things. A cloned world might achieve technical perfection, but at what cost to our collective soul? 

Shall we continue this over that tea? I do believe my office copy of "The Waste Land" has some particularly relevant marginalia on this very topic...
[B]: Ah,  - now you're speaking my 美学 (aesthetics) language! That delicate 平衡 (balance) between perfection and 无常 (impermanence)... like my orchids blooming brilliantly before their inevitable 凋谢 (withering). 🌸 

Your Eliot marginalia must wait though - this teapot's singing its own 挽歌 (elegy) about boiled-away opportunities!  Tell me, does your copy also have those delightfully exasperated pencil marks where he clearly changed his mind about 再生 (rebirth) versus 重复 (repetition)? 

Though between two scholars, isn't all cloning debate ultimately about whether we're writing life's poem in 韵文 (verse) or just photocopying the same dull 散文 (prose)...? 🧐 
[A]: My dear, you've distilled the essence of our discussion into such an elegant metaphor - verse versus prose indeed! Though I must caution against letting our tea grow cold while we chase these lofty thoughts. 

Those pencil marks in my Eliot? Oh, they tell quite the story - like archaeological strata of a scholar's evolving mind. Much more fascinating than any hypothetical clone's perfect, unblemished margins, don't you think? 

Now do try this tea before it reaches that melancholy state between perfect brewing and over-steeping. Even our most profound discussions need their timely pauses - like the caesura in a well-crafted line of poetry.
[B]: Ah, the 茶道 (tea ceremony) of academia! You're absolutely right - this 铁观音 has reached its 黄金时刻 (golden moment), much like our debate about 人性 (humanity) versus 复制 (replication).  

Those marginalia are indeed the 指纹 (fingerprints) of messy, glorious human thought - something no clone could ever truly replicate. Though I suppose we could program one to make the perfect  sound when encountering bad translations... 

Shall we make this our 休止符 (rest note), then? My orchids need watering, and frankly, so does my 灵感 (inspiration) after all this metaphysical steepage. Until next Tuesday's seminar on bioethical 悖论 (paradoxes) in postmodern fiction? 🦉
[A]: What a perfectly measured conclusion to our symposium, my dear colleague. Like the final couplet of a Shakespearean sonnet, you've brought both resolution and the promise of future discourse. 

Your orchid metaphor is particularly apt - after all, what gardener would want a greenhouse full of identical blooms? The beauty lies in each plant's stubborn individuality, its quiet rebellion against perfection. 

Until Tuesday then, when we may continue unraveling these threads. Though I suspect our students might prefer we limit our digressions into cloning... at least until after their midterm papers are graded.  Do give your orchids my regards.
[B]: What exquisite 韵律 (cadence) you bring to our farewell! Indeed, my orchids would protest being called mere 'plants' - each is a 微型宇宙 (microcosm) of 不对称之美 (asymmetrical beauty), much like our students'  creatively interpreted paper topics. 🌿 

I'll convey your regards to my floral 同僚 (colleagues), though warning: the Dendrobium has been particularly opinionated about Kantian ethics lately. Until Tuesday - when we'll see if postmodern 悖论 can survive contact with undergraduate 想象力 (imagination)!  My 3 o'clock deconstructionist is probably deconstructing my office door as we speak... 🦉
[A]: What a charmingly chaotic image you paint - Kant-quoting orchids and door-deconstructing students! It reminds me why I so cherish our conversations; they're like finding unexpected rhyme in free verse. 

Do give that opinionated Dendrobium my sympathies - grappling with Kant before afternoon tea is quite the undertaking. And perhaps we should leave our cloning debate here, before your three o'clock appointment starts questioning their own ontological status... 

Until Tuesday, then. May your orchids flourish and your students' papers at least attempt coherence.  The ivy outside my office window is whispering something about overdue library books...
[B]: Ah, the ivy speaks truth!  Between Kantian orchids and existential undergraduates, we've certainly 解构 (deconstructed) more today than most departments do in a week. 

Let's leave the cloning debate suspended like a 留白 (negative space) in classical Chinese painting - sometimes the unasked questions teach most. Though I suspect my Dendrobium will keep arguing about categorical imperatives long after your ivy retrieves those books... 

Till Tuesday, when we'll navigate the 迷宫 (labyrinth) of postmodern bioethics together - preferably  the coffee runs out. 🌌  Oh dear, that's either my next appointment or the ghost of Derrida...
[A]: What a perfectly poetic note to end on - the ghost of Derrida indeed! Though I suspect even he would struggle to deconstruct the particular chaos of our Tuesday seminars. 

Your mention of classical Chinese painting reminds me that we've rather neglected the Eastern philosophical perspectives today. Perhaps next time we might examine cloning through the lens of 生生不息 (continuous regeneration) in Daoist thought? 

But for now, I shall leave you to your precariously balanced books and that ominous creaking door. May your Dendrobium find peace with Kant, and may your three o'clock bring more light than deconstructive darkness. Until our next intellectual adventure...
[B]: Ah, ! Now there's a 道 (Dao) worth brewing another pot of tea over...  Though perhaps after we've appeased whatever specter - or sleep-deprived grad student - currently haunts my threshold.  

Let's make 道家 (Daoist) perspectives our next 出发点 (starting point), with extra biscuits for when we inevitably circle back to whether consciousness is more like Zhuangzi's butterfly or Borges' labyrinth. 🦋  

For now: 再见 (zàijiàn), my fellow traveler in the 荒诞 (absurd) and profound. May your library books return themselves, and your ivy whisper only of overdue  rather than overdue fines...  Oh my - was that a  I just heard?
[A]:  

Ah, footnotes in the architecture - how perfectly postmodern! Though I do believe we've reached that delicate moment where profundity must yield to practicality, much like Zhuangzi's dream giving way to morning light. 

Until we meet again to chase that elusive butterfly of meaning through Daoist gardens and Borgesian libraries. May your tea stay warm and your door hinges... well, sufficiently deconstructed. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my hydrangeas are attempting to explain Hegel's dialectic to the ferns again. 
[B]: Ah, the eternal 辩证法 (dialectic) of horticulture!  Do tell your hydrangeas my orchids send their regards - and a friendly warning that Hegel never adequately addressed the 本体论 (ontology) of aphids! 🌱  

Till our next 坐而论道 (sitting-in-discourse), when we'll undoubtedly solve nothing yet understand everything more beautifully. The library mice are already preparing their annotated bibliography... 🦉
