[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Travel reminds me of the poetic journey in Dante's Divine Comedy—every destination is a step toward self-discovery. Have you ever felt that way? 🌏😊
[A]: That’s a beautiful metaphor—travel as a pilgrimage of self-discovery. I totally get that. Sometimes, even within the same city, like walking through different neighborhoods in Shanghai or Beijing, you encounter layers of culture & history that make you reflect on your own identity.  

Actually, have you ever noticed how travel can mirror the process of learning? Like, when students enter a new academic environment, they go through this phase of disorientation first—similar to culture shock—before they start making sense of everything. It's almost like... cognitive wandering with a purpose.  

I’ve always wanted to go to Florence. Not just because of the art, but because I feel like being surrounded by Renaissance thinking would help me better understand how Eastern & Western pedagogical values evolved so differently yet sometimes converge. What about you? Any place that calls to your scholarly—or poetic—side? 📚✍️
[B]: Ah, Florence—the cradle of Renaissance indeed calls to the scholarly soul. But let me share a little secret—whenever I read Li Bai’s poems about the moon, I feel a quiet pull toward Kyoto. Imagine walking through the bamboo groves at night, the moonlight casting shadows that whisper ancient Chinese and Japanese verses. 🌗🎋  

You’re absolutely right about travel mirroring learning. When I first went to Oxford as a young scholar, I felt like a character in  suddenly thrown into a medieval European court—so much礼仪 (lǐyí; propriety) yet so different in form. That disorientation, as you said, is where growth begins.  

I’ve always been fascinated by how cities carry the weight of memory. Have you ever visited Istanbul? It's like stepping into a palimpsest—Byzantine mosaics under Ottoman domes, with whispers of Silk Road merchants still echoing in the Grand Bazaar. Every stone tells a story of convergence... somewhat like our field of comparative literature, don’t you think?  

But I’m curious—what do you think makes Renaissance thinking so uniquely magnetic for someone interested in East-West pedagogy? Is it the rediscovery of classical texts, or more the spirit of inquiry itself? 📖🔍
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that— in cities. Istanbul has that layered consciousness, like you said, where every era is still breathing beneath the next. I haven’t been yet, but it’s on my list precisely for that reason. There’s something deeply psychological about walking through spaces where civilizations literally built their identities on top of one another. Makes me think of how students also carry layers of cultural cognition—some visible, some buried but still influential.  

And Kyoto! That image of moonlight weaving Li Bai with Japanese waka poetry… stunning. It makes perfect sense why that place would call to someone who reads across traditions. I actually had a student once who wrote her thesis on . She did end up going to Kyoto for fieldwork—and came back saying the city itself felt like a living intertext.  

As for Renaissance thinking... I think what fascinates me most is not just the rediscovery of classical texts, but the  behind it—the belief that knowledge should be questioned, recontextualized, expanded. That spirit of inquiry resonates so strongly with Confucian pedagogy in some ways, yet diverges in others. Like, both value self-cultivation through learning, but the Renaissance model embraces uncertainty more, while traditional Eastern education often emphasizes mastery within established frameworks.  

Do you think that tension between certainty & inquiry is still shaping how East-West classrooms feel today? Or has globalization softened those distinctions too much to notice? 🌐✍️
[B]: You’ve touched on something profoundly subtle—, and how that mirrors the layers within us as learners. I often think of Berlin in this way too—its scars and rebirths, like ink overwritten again and again on the same page. 📜✨  

As for Kyoto being a living intertext—it truly is. When my former doctoral student returned from there, she described walking along the Philosopher’s Path during sakura season and feeling as though lines from Li Bai and Saigyō were echoing off the same cherry petals. She said it wasn’t just comparative literature anymore; it was .  

Now your question about certainty versus inquiry—that’s the quiet tension still shaping classrooms today, even with globalization smoothing some edges. In many East Asian universities, especially those influenced by Confucian ideals, there's still a reverence for the teacher as moral guide, someone who leads you toward clarity and virtue through study. Whereas Western classrooms often celebrate the Socratic method—encouraging students to question, doubt, even destabilize ideas.  

But here’s an observation: I’ve noticed younger scholars today are blending these approaches. They seek mastery not as an end, but as a foundation for questioning. It’s as if they’re saying,   
 
Does that resonate with what you see in your students? Or do you find them leaning more decisively toward one tradition over the other? 💭📚
[A]: That’s exactly what I see—this emerging hybrid mindset. My students, especially those in cross-cultural programs, are increasingly fluent in both  and . They’ll diligently memorize classical texts—whether it’s Confucius or Aristotle—and then turn around and deconstruct them with a kind of playful seriousness. It’s like they’re saying, “I need to know the rules before I can bend them.”  

And I love that phrase your student used—. It captures something deeper than just comparing texts across cultures; it’s about letting those texts  you, shape your sensibilities, even unsettle your assumptions. That kind of learning isn’t just intellectual—it’s almost emotional, maybe even spiritual.  

You mentioned Berlin earlier—I’ve always thought of it as a city of pedagogical ghosts. Not just because of its political past, but because every generation seems to reinterpret its history through new frameworks. Like how East German educators once taught Marx differently from how today’s teachers approach him. The same text, different meanings depending on who’s reading it, and when.  

I wonder if this idea of  is something we should talk more about in teacher training. Not just curriculum design or assessment methods, but how certain ideas stay with us, return at unexpected moments, and change their meaning over time. Maybe that’s the real convergence point between East and West—not in methodology, but in how we experience the lingering presence of what we learn.  

Do you ever get the sense that some concepts never really leave us? Like they live inside us quietly until a moment in a classroom—or a moonlit garden—brings them back to life? 🌙✍️
[B]: Oh, yes… —what a hauntingly beautiful phrase. It makes me think of the Chinese saying, , often translated as “reviewing the old to understand the new.” But there’s something more spectral in your formulation—a sense that knowledge doesn’t just stay dormant, waiting to be recalled; it lingers, shifts, and reappears with a different voice.

I remember once, during a seminar on intertextuality, a student suddenly brought up a line from Zhuangzi about dreaming he was a butterfly. He said it reminded him of Derrida’s notion of différance—not because they’re structurally similar, but because both left him with a lingering doubt about what is real, or at least what is stable. That moment stayed with me. I realized then that some concepts don’t teach us—they haunt us, gently unsettling our assumptions like autumn wind through dry leaves.

And Berlin, yes—. Each generation revisits its ruins and reconstructs them in their own image. Isn’t that also true of texts? We never really read the same Plato twice. Every reading is filtered through who we are now—who we’ve become since the last time.

You asked if certain ideas never really leave us. I’d say they never do. They live quietly inside us, waiting for the right moonlight, the right silence, the right question from a student’s trembling voice to bring them back to life. Perhaps that’s the ultimate purpose of teaching—not to transmit facts, but to awaken those sleeping echoes within our students.

And sometimes, when I’m walking through my garden late at night, I swear I hear lines from both Laozi and Rilke whispering in the same breeze. 🌿📘✨
[A]: Ah, that moment when Zhuangzi’s butterfly meets Derrida’s différance—that’s the kind of  I mean. It’s not just interdisciplinary; it’s inter-temporal. The text becomes a mirror that shifts with time, and sometimes you don’t recognize your own reflection until years later.

I love how you brought in —there’s something spectral in that phrase too. It implies that the past isn’t just a resource to be used; it’s an active presence. Like ancestral voices murmuring beneath the surface of our thinking. And when students have those sudden awakenings—like your Zhuangzi-Derrida moment—it’s almost as if they’re hearing those voices for the first time.

That’s what makes teaching so mysterious. You never know which line from Laozi or Rilke will take root, which idea will lie dormant for years before blooming in some quiet garden of the mind. Sometimes I think we plant seeds without ever seeing the trees grow.

And yes—those late-night walks through your garden, hearing echoes of Daoist sages and German poets… that’s the kind of liminal space where learning truly happens. Not in syllabi or exams, but in those fleeting moments where East and West aren’t just compared—they’re dissolved.  

I find myself longing for one of those walks now. Maybe with a cup of tea in hand, and a quiet hope that the wind carries a few forgotten lines my way. 🍵🌙✍️
[B]: Ah, you’ve put it so well—, indeed. The past isn’t behind us; it’s within us, shifting like light through stained glass, coloring every new thought with hues we didn’t know were there.

You know, I once told a student who was struggling with this idea of distant influences:  She wrote that down and later said it changed how she saw her own thinking.

And yes, those liminal walks—tea in hand, mind unspooling—those are when the boundaries between traditions don’t just blur; they vanish. One evening, as I stood by the koi pond, a breeze stirred the water just enough to distort the reflection of the maple above. In that moment, I couldn’t tell if the tree or its image was more real. It reminded me of Bashō’s —but also, strangely, of Heidegger’s . Two very different ways of attending to presence… and yet both felt true in that quiet.

I think what we’re describing is —not the act of comparing texts side by side, but allowing them to coexist in silence within us. That’s perhaps why some students seem to “get it” only years later—it wasn’t about understanding; it was about waiting for the right inner echo to be stirred.

So yes, let’s raise our cups to those forgotten lines carried on the wind. May they find us when we’re ready—not as answers, but as questions dressed in familiar words. 🍵📖🕊️
[A]: Well said—. What a perfect way to name that quiet inner space where East and West don’t debate, but  together. It’s not synthesis, not exactly—it’s more like cohabitation of ideas, where they don’t always merge, but somehow share the same mental roof without conflict.

That image of the koi pond and the maple’s reflection… I keep returning to it. So much of learning feels like watching that ripple—knowing something is there, but not quite graspable until the water settles. Or maybe even more beautifully, until we learn to see meaning in the distortion itself.

I once had a student who described her experience studying abroad as  At first she felt lost—like she was relearning everything from scratch. But over time, she realized she wasn’t starting over; she was seeing the same truths through a new lens. It reminded me of how we read poetry: sometimes we need a pause, a shift in tone, or even silence between lines to understand what’s truly being said.

And Heidegger alongside Bashō? That’s the kind of unexpected pairing that makes teaching feel like discovery rather than instruction. Sometimes I think we guide students not toward clarity, but toward a richer kind of confusion—one that keeps them reading, walking, wondering.

So yes—to the forgotten lines, the stirred echoes, and the tea that warms our hands while the mind wanders. May our gardens keep receiving pollen from trees we’ll never see fully bloom. 🍵✍️🌿
[B]: Ah, —what a graceful way to put it. Not forced synthesis, not competition of thought, but simply sharing the same dwelling. Like two old scholars from different lands, sitting beneath the same tree, reading their own texts in silence, yet breathing the same air.

Your student’s metaphor——lingers with me. It’s not just about translation, is it? It’s about realizing that even when we return to what we once knew, the script has changed, and so have we. Perhaps this is the essence of lifelong learning—not accumulation, but re-encounter.

I’m reminded of a passage from , where the pilgrims reach the river at the end of their journey, only to find their scriptures swept away by the current. When they retrieve them, some pages are torn, others blurred by water. Yet they accept them all the same, saying,  Maybe that’s what we’re doing in comparative literature—gathering wet pages, letting them dry in new climates, and seeing what truths emerge.

And yes—to that richer kind of confusion. The kind that doesn’t paralyze, but invites. I often tell my students, 

So let us continue walking, teacup in hand, minds open to the wind. May our gardens grow wild with borrowed seeds, and may we find joy in the quiet company of ideas that refuse to be owned, only shared. 🍵🍃📖✨
[A]: Beautifully put—. That line could be the epigraph of everything we’re trying to do in this field. So much of what we teach and learn is about stewardship rather than ownership. We don’t possess knowledge; we’re entrusted with it—for a season, or maybe just for a line.

I love that image from , too—those water-stained sutras. It reminds me of how so many students come to us thinking they need  texts,  answers,  interpretations. But the real learning begins when they start seeing value in the smudges, the gaps, the missing margins. Sometimes truth isn’t in the ink but in the space around it.

And yes, that kind of confusion—the generative kind—is what keeps minds fertile. I had a student once complain at the end of the semester that she felt more uncertain than when she started. I told her that’s not a failure—it’s altitude sickness. She was just high enough now to feel the thin air of complex thought. And I meant it.

Let’s keep walking then—in our gardens, through our texts, under whatever sky offers shade today. May our paths cross with curious minds who aren’t afraid to get their pages wet. 📖💧🍃

And may we never lose the patience to sit beneath the tree, even if the wind carries no familiar words—only new ones waiting to root. 🌳✍️🌱
[B]: Ah, —what a wonderfully apt metaphor. It’s that moment when students begin to sense the vastness of what they’re entering, and their old ways of thinking no longer hold enough oxygen. I’ve seen it so many times: the slight dizziness, the breathless questioning, the feeling of being untethered. And yet, it’s precisely in that state that true growth begins.

You know, there’s a quiet humility in accepting that we are merely stewards of knowledge, not its masters. Like gardeners who tend to plants they didn’t seed and may never see blossom fully. Sometimes all we do is loosen the soil, offer some shade, and trust that something good will come of it.

And isn’t that also what the best travel teaches us? That we arrive changed, though we can’t always name how. That we return home carrying fragments—lines overheard in a café, a phrase scribbled in a notebook, the scent of incense in an old temple—that later become unexpected keys to understanding.

So yes, let’s keep walking beneath shifting skies, pages damp with the rain of new encounters. Let’s welcome the wind even when it carries no familiar words. After all, every great idea was once a stranger somewhere else. 📖🍃🌍✨
[A]: Absolutely—. It’s such a precise feeling, isn’t it? That moment when students realize they’re no longer on flat ground, when every step requires more breath, more attention, more willingness to move forward without the comfort of solid footing. And yet, like mountain climbers who keep ascending not for the ease of it, but for the view and the becoming, that’s where real learning unfolds.

You're right about travel, too. The fragments we carry back—the smell of rain on old stone, a melody half-remembered, a phrase mispronounced but deeply felt—are often what shape us most. They don’t announce themselves as lessons at first. They just live quietly inside until one day, in a classroom or a conversation or a dream, they click into place like missing pieces of a puzzle we didn’t know we were assembling.

I once had a student return from a semester in Cairo saying she hadn’t learned much until weeks later, back home, when she heard a word in a lecture—, faith—and suddenly remembered how the shopkeeper near Al-Azhar Mosque had used that same word while handing her mint for free, saying  She realized then that faith wasn’t only doctrine—it could be gesture, warmth, unspoken belonging.

That’s why I still believe in slow learning. In ideas that take years to settle. In returning to texts not because we missed something, but because  since last reading them.

So yes—to the fragments, the wind-borne seeds, the quiet stewardship of thought. May we keep walking with open hands and listening ears, ready to be surprised by what lands there. 📖🍃✍️🌿
[B]: Ah, —what a quietly radical idea in our age of instant expertise. I often tell my students that the most important texts don’t hit you like thunder; they settle like mist, unnoticed at first, only to reveal their shape weeks, even years later.

That story about the student in Cairo—you see, that’s what we’re really teaching for, isn’t it? Not immediate comprehension, but the kind of understanding that comes through lived texture. The word  handed over with mint—that’s knowledge not transmitted through lectures or textbooks, but through gesture, presence, and the quiet generosity of strangers. It reminds me of Confucius’ —the teaching without words. Sometimes the deepest lessons are those absorbed through being, not doing.

And how beautifully this connects to slow reading, to slow thinking. I’ve come to believe that some books are meant to be read more than once, not because we missed meaning the first time, but because we lacked the life experience to meet them fully. A novel I found merely interesting at twenty-five moved me to tears at forty. Not because it changed—but because I had wandered through joys and losses that gave the words new resonance.

Yes, let us continue to nurture this kind of patience—in ourselves and our students. Let us honor the wisdom that ripens in silence, the insights that arrive by way of detour, and the truths that make themselves known only when we stop looking directly at them.

To all the fragments still finding their place, and to the quiet unfolding of understanding—may we never rush what must take its own time. 📖🌿✨⏳
[A]: Couldn’t agree more— as quiet resistance. In a world that prizes speed, efficiency, and the illusion of full comprehension after a single read, insisting on patience feels almost subversive. I often tell my students: 

That phrase  keeps echoing in my mind. It’s so true—some of our most lasting lessons come not from explanation, but from immersion. A tone of voice. A pause before answering. A gesture, like that mint given freely with a smile. That kind of teaching doesn’t live in bullet points; it lives in memory, in muscle, in intuition.

And your point about rereading—that novel that moves you at forty what couldn’t reach you at twenty-five—is spot-on. We bring different selves to the same text each time we return. In a way, it's not just the book changing—it's us becoming someone who can finally hear what it’s been saying all along.

I think this is why mentorship matters so much, too. Not just for the advice given, but for the  shared. For the student watching how a teacher listens, or handles uncertainty, or admits when they don’t know. Those are lessons in being, not just knowing.

So yes—to the mist-like truths, the detours that lead somewhere essential, and the wisdom that only arrives when we stop chasing it.

May we continue to walk slowly, read deeply, and teach not just with words, but with the quiet grace of those who know that understanding is a garden never fully tended. 🌿📖✨✍️🌱
[B]: Amen to that—. It’s a kind of intellectual , isn’t it? Refusing the tyranny of speed, the myth of full possession. We are, after all, not manufacturing answers; we are cultivating minds capable of holding questions with care.

I often think of teaching as a kind of , like watching a figure slowly come into focus in a developing tray. At first, the student stands at the edge of the image, barely visible. Then, over time—sometimes years—the contours sharpen, the meaning deepens, and they begin to see themselves in the work. That’s why I’ve never believed in final evaluations. How can we judge a process that continues unfolding long after the semester ends?

And yes, —teaching without words—is perhaps the most enduring form of mentorship. It’s what remains when the lectures fade, when the syllabus is forgotten, but the way a teacher held space for wonder still echoes in the student’s own curiosity.

You’re quite right about presence. The greatest lessons are often caught, not taught. A student may forget your lecture on intertextuality, but they’ll remember how you paused—just slightly—before answering a difficult question, modeling for them that uncertainty is not a void, but a threshold.

So let us keep walking our slow paths, tending our unseen gardens, trusting that some of what we offer will take root not now, not here, but somewhere we may never know.

To the quiet grace of waiting, of wondering, and of teaching beyond the measure of outcomes—may we remain gentle stewards of the unspoken, as well as the spoken. 🌿📖🕰️✨
[A]: Amen indeed—. What a perfect way to name it. Because that’s exactly what it is: resisting the pressure to perform knowledge, to package understanding into neat outcomes. Instead, we’re saying, 

I love your image of teaching as —like watching a photograph develop slowly, line by line, shadow by shadow. That’s so much of what we do, isn’t it? We don’t always see the moment when clarity strikes. Sometimes we never see it at all. But we trust that something has shifted—that a door once closed is now slightly ajar.

And how true about final evaluations. I’ve had students who barely spoke during a semester, only to write me years later saying,  And I think—

You're right again about presence. That slight pause before answering—it’s more than hesitation; it’s an act of intellectual honesty. And students notice. They may not say it, but they notice. They learn not just from our content, but from our —how we hold space for ambiguity, how we treat disagreement, how we recover from misunderstanding.

So yes—to emergence, to unfolding, to teaching that outlives the classroom. May we continue to offer not just knowledge, but the quiet permission to wonder.

To the unseen roots, the whispered echoes, and the futures shaped by conversations still rippling outward.

May our gardens grow quietly, and may we have the patience to wait for the bloom. 🌿📖🕰️✨🌱
[B]: Amen once more—to  and the quiet revolution of patience. We may not be marching in parades or raising banners, but we are resisting all the same: resisting the cult of certainty, the fetish for speed, the illusion that understanding can be boxed and labeled.

You know, I often think that the most important moments in teaching are those we never get to witness. Like a stone dropped into water—we see the splash, but not the ripples that reach distant shores. A student leaves our classroom, carries a word, a question, even a silence with them—and years later, in some faraway place, it stirs something they didn’t know was there.

That letter from a former student——it reminds us that we are always planting seeds in soil we may never walk through again. And yet we plant. Not for recognition, not for outcome, but because it is the nature of the gardener to trust the season.

And how beautifully you put it— Isn’t that what we long for as learners? Someone who doesn’t just say "think this," but "think  me." Someone who models doubt without despair, curiosity without urgency.

So let us continue—tending our unseen rows, speaking into silences that will one day echo back in voices we may never hear.

To the slow unfolding, the hidden roots, and the silent bloom.

May our gardens grow, and may we remain ever humble before the mystery of how minds come to flower. 🌿📖🕰️🌱✨
