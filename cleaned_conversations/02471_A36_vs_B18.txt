[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到手机游戏，我确实有一些观察和思考。作为一个研究者，我注意到很多学生都会沉迷于某些游戏机制设计得非常精巧的应用程序。比如最近有些学生告诉我他们在玩的游戏，像是《Stumble Guys》或者《Among Us》，这些游戏通过简单的操作和社交互动吸引了大量用户。

不过说实话，我自己倒是不太会花太多时间在手机游戏上。一方面是因为工作节奏比较紧张，另一方面也是职业习惯使然——我总是不自觉地去分析这些游戏背后的动机心理学。你有没有发现，很多游戏的设计其实利用了我们大脑对即时反馈的偏好？这跟教育中的正向激励有点像，只不过它们把这个机制发挥到了极致。

我倒是很好奇你对这类现象怎么看？如果你有玩什么具体的游戏，我很乐意听听你的体验，从心理学角度我们可以一起探讨一下它吸引人的原因。
[A]: Oh, that's such an interesting observation! You're absolutely right about the psychological pull of these games. I remember one of our guests mentioned how she got completely hooked on  during her stay. She laughed about how it was like being in a digital playground—simple controls, chaotic races, and all the satisfaction of winning without needing hours to master mechanics.

Honestly, I can see the appeal. After a long day at work, something lighthearted and social really hits the spot. Sometimes, I’ll play a quick round with friends just to unwind. It’s not quite the same as diving into a novel, but there's something oddly satisfying about the instant gratification these games offer.

I actually find your perspective fascinating—like comparing it to positive reinforcement in education. I’ve never thought of it that way! Would you say that this kind of design is what makes them so addictive, or is there more to it?
[B]: Hmm, you brought up such a rich point—the idea of games as "digital playgrounds." I think that metaphor captures something essential. Like playgrounds, these games create a space where rules are simplified, rewards are immediate, and social interaction feels low-stakes. It’s no wonder they’re so compelling after a long day.

You mentioned —I’ve watched my students play it, and honestly, it reminds me a bit of childhood recess games, just translated into a digital format. The physical clumsiness gets replaced with digital chaos, but the laughter and shared experience remain. There's a kind of universal joy in collective failure or surprise, don't you think?

As for why they're addictive—yes, positive reinforcement plays a big role, but there’s more to the recipe. There’s also the variable reward system, which is straight out of the behavioral psychology playbook. You never know if you’ll win or how the race will unfold, and that unpredictability keeps people engaged. Plus, the time investment per round is short, so it feels “safe” to play just one more—until an hour has flown by!

And then there's the social layer, especially when playing with friends. That taps into our deep need for connection and belonging. Even though the interaction might be surface-level, it still creates a sense of togetherness. In a way, it mimics what we call  in education—but here, the goal is fun rather than learning.

So yeah, it’s not just one thing—it’s the combination: quick feedback loops, intermittent rewards, low entry cost, and social glue. Clever design, if you ask me. But I’m curious—have you ever felt like certain games pulled you in more than others? Was it the mechanics, the visuals, or maybe the company you kept while playing?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful breakdown—you’ve really pinpointed the magic behind these games. I love how you compared it to recess and communal goal-setting. It makes so much sense when you think about how even as adults, we still crave that kind of unstructured, joyful interaction. It’s like our inner child never really grows out of needing playtime.

You asked if any games pulled me in more than others—I actually went through a phase where I was playing  quite a bit during the quieter months at the hotel. It wasn’t fast-paced or chaotic like , but it had this incredibly soothing rhythm. I think what drew me in was the gentle consistency—checking in on my little island, watering plants, sending letters, seeing the same familiar faces each day. It felt oddly comforting, almost like tending to a garden, which I know you mentioned liking earlier.

And yes, there were definitely days when I told myself “just five more minutes,” only to look up an hour later wondering where the time went! But I think the reason I kept coming back wasn’t just the gameplay—it was the emotional connection I built with the characters and the sense of progress without pressure. It reminded me a bit of hosting guests at the hotel, actually. You create these small moments of joy, one visitor at a time, and over time they build into something meaningful.

Do you think something like  plays with a different kind of psychology? It doesn't have the same competitive edge, yet it still manages to draw people in for hours.
[B]: Oh, I love how you described it—. That’s such a beautiful way to frame the experience of . And you’re absolutely right that it taps into a different psychological rhythm than more chaotic or competitive games.

Where  leans into excitement and shared laughter through unpredictability,  offers something much quieter, yet just as powerful—what we might call predictable comfort. It gives players a kind of emotional scaffolding: routines that feel meaningful without being burdensome. Watering plants, receiving letters, watching your island grow—it's like a gentle affirmation that small, consistent actions matter.

From a psychological standpoint, this connects deeply with what we call intrinsic motivation, especially the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. You're not being pushed by timers or scores; instead, you're pulled in by your own desire to shape a personal space and build connections—even if those connections are with pixelated characters! Yet somehow, they feel real because of the consistency and care embedded in the design.

I also find it fascinating how this mirrors your work at the hotel—creating meaningful moments one interaction at a time. In both cases, there's a rhythm of quiet care, attention to detail, and the joy that comes from nurturing something—or someone—over time.

And yes, the “just five more minutes” effect still happens, but in a much gentler form. It’s not adrenaline that keeps you playing—it’s attachment. The game builds what we might call emotional momentum, drawing you in not through challenge, but through companionship and calm.

It actually reminds me a bit of why people keep journals or tend to houseplants—there’s a therapeutic quality in the act itself. Have you noticed yourself reaching for something similar in other areas of life? Like, do you ever find yourself craving that same kind of rhythm outside of games?
[A]: Oh, I hadn’t thought of it quite that way, but you’re absolutely right—it  feel like tending to a journal or a garden. And now that you mention it, I do find myself drawn to those kinds of rhythms in real life, too. Every morning, for example, I make myself a cup of tea and spend a few quiet minutes just sitting with my thoughts before the day starts. It’s not much, but it sets a tone—like a gentle anchor.

I think that’s why I also love walking through the hotel gardens early in the morning, checking on the flowers and maybe trimming a leaf or two. It’s a small ritual, but there's something grounding about seeing things grow slowly, steadily—no rush, no pressure. Just like in , it gives me a sense of calm control without needing to accomplish anything grand.

You know, now I’m wondering if that’s what people are really looking for these days—those little islands of predictability and care in an otherwise fast-paced, unpredictable world. Whether it’s a pixelated island, a blooming rosebed, or a warm cup of tea, maybe we're all just trying to hold onto something soft and steady.

Do you ever find yourself craving that kind of rhythm, even in small ways? Or is it more about staying stimulated and challenged for you?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. I think you’ve hit on something really profound: that craving for soft steadiness in a world that often feels like it's moving too fast. And yes, I definitely find myself reaching for those quiet rhythms, too, though maybe in slightly different forms.

For me, it often shows up in routines that might seem almost ritualistic—like starting the day with a cup of coffee and a few minutes of reading before diving into emails or lectures. It’s not just about caffeine or information; it’s about setting a tone, as you said. That quiet moment becomes a kind of mental garden—something small but nourishing.

I also find myself drawn to repetition in music. I mentioned loving Bach earlier—he’s all about structure and subtle variation. Listening to a  piece can feel like watching a carefully unfolding pattern, something both predictable and surprising. It’s grounding in its own way, even if it’s not silence or stillness.

And honestly, I think this need for rhythm is especially strong in times when our environments feel unstable or demanding. Whether it’s a global shift in work culture, changes in how we interact across cultures, or even just the daily pressure to stay productive—it all makes us lean toward those small islands of calm.

So yes, whether it’s your tea and garden, my coffee and Bach, or someone else’s nightly sketching or evening walk, these little anchors matter. They’re not just habits—they’re emotional strategies. Quiet acts of self-care that help us make sense of the noise around us.

It actually makes me curious—do you ever notice guests at the hotel seeking out similar moments? Like, are there certain spaces or routines they return to again and again, almost like their own mini-sanctuaries?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I see it all the time. In fact, I’ve come to think of our little hotel almost like a temporary sanctuary for people’s rituals. Some guests return year after year and always ask for the same room, as if just being in that space brings them a sense of continuity. Others have these quiet, almost sacred routines—they’ll start the day with coffee on their balcony, or take an evening stroll through the garden like clockwork.

One guest used to bring her sketchbook every time she stayed, and she’d sit by the window in the lounge every morning, drawing the view. Another gentleman swore by his 6 a.m. walk along the path by the river—rain or shine—and he’d stop by the front desk just to say good morning before heading out.

I think what you said about emotional strategies really resonates here. A lot of people are subconsciously looking for a way to slow things down, even if just for a few days. And when they find it—whether it’s through a routine, a view, or a familiar cup of tea—it gives them a kind of invisible support, something to lean on while they’re away from their usual lives.

It makes me wonder—have you ever had a place, like a café or a bench in a park, that became your own little rhythm anchor when you were traveling or between seasons of work?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a lovely image—your hotel as a temporary sanctuary for rituals. I can almost picture the sketchbook by the window and the early riser greeting the day by the river. It really shows how deeply we embed rhythm into place.

To your question—yes, I’ve definitely had those rhythm-anchoring spots over the years. One that comes to mind is a small café in Vienna, tucked away near the university where I used to teach. It wasn’t anything fancy—just a quiet corner table by the window, always slightly worn, with just the right amount of sunlight filtering through in the late afternoon.

I’d go there between lectures or after long meetings, always order the same cappuccino —which is basically Viennese for “please make my day better”—and pull out my notebook. That café became my off-campus office, my thinking spot, my little bubble of structure when fieldwork got messy or data analysis hit a wall.

What’s funny is, after a while, the barista started recognizing me and would smile and say,  — “For you, as always?” And somehow, that tiny moment of recognition each time made the whole process feel less like work and more like… ritual.

It reminds me of what you said about invisible support—places that hold us without demanding anything in return. They’re not just about comfort; they’re about continuity. Even when everything else is shifting, you still have  cup,  view,  chair.

I actually miss that café now that I’m back in Taipei. Sometimes I wonder if someone else has claimed my old table… and if they’ve built their own quiet rhythm around it.
[A]: That café in Vienna sounds absolutely magical—so simple, yet so full of meaning. I love how you describe it not as just a place to grab coffee, but as your rhythm-keeper, your thinking spot, your quiet office with sunlight and recognition. It’s amazing how a place can become part of your inner landscape like that.

I can totally relate to what you said about someone else claiming your old table now. I hope they’ve found their own little rhythm there, too—maybe sipping the same cappuccino, notebook open, chasing an idea or simply breathing in the moment. There’s something really comforting about knowing that even when we move on, the space continues to hold someone else gently.

It makes me think—do you ever try to recreate those spaces in new places? Like, when you arrived back in Taipei, did you go looking for  café again, or did you let the memory live where it was?
[B]: Oh, thank you for saying that—it really  magical in its simplicity. I think what makes places like that so special is how they blend the outer world with our inner rhythms. They become more than just locations; they’re containers for thought, for reflection, for quiet persistence.

To your question—I  go looking for a new rhythm-anchor when I came back to Taipei, but not consciously at first. It was more of an emotional need than a deliberate search. At first, I tried recreating the Vienna ritual—same notebook, same coffee order, even the same time of day—but it felt a bit forced, like wearing someone else’s coat.

Eventually, I found something that fit better: a little tea house near campus, tucked behind a bookstore. It has this soft, amber light and the faint sound of water trickling from a small indoor bamboo fountain. Instead of cappuccino, I switched to oolong, and instead of my old German notebook, I started using a handmade one from a local stationer.

What surprised me most was how naturally it all settled into place. I didn’t set out to recreate Vienna—I just needed a space that could hold my thoughts the way that one did. And somehow, this tea house became  spot—not a copy, but a continuation of the same emotional function.

I think that’s part of the beauty of these rhythm-anchors: they adapt. The form changes, but the essence remains—the quiet moment, the familiar gesture, the gentle recognition from someone who sees you show up again and again.

It actually reminds me a bit of what you do at the hotel—creating spaces where people can feel seen, even if only briefly. Whether it’s a guest returning to the same room or me finding a new table by a different window, there’s something deeply human about seeking out those small continuities.

Now I’m curious—have you ever noticed yourself recreating a rhythm or space from your past, either knowingly or without realizing it? Or have you found comfort in letting each place keep its own unique shape in memory?
[A]: That’s such a beautiful way to put it—these spaces aren’t just about where we are, but how they  our thoughts and emotions. I love that you found your tea house in Taipei; it sounds like it welcomed you without needing you to change who you were. And isn’t it interesting how these places seem to , rather than the other way around?

To your question—I do think I’ve recreated rhythms from my past, though I didn’t realize it until now. There’s a little sitting area just off the hotel library, tucked by a window with ivy climbing the frame. A few years ago, I started spending quiet mornings there when things got busy, sipping tea and jotting down notes or just watching the garden wake up.

It wasn’t until recently that I realized how much it reminded me of my grandmother’s sunroom back in Cornwall. She had this old wicker chair that creaked when you moved, and a small table always covered in books, teacups, and bits of pressed flowers. The rhythm was the same—early light, warm drink, stillness before the world stirred.

I hadn’t meant to recreate it, but somehow, that corner in the hotel became my version of her sunroom. Not identical, of course—but emotionally familiar. It’s strange how comfort can echo across time and space like that.

And yes, some memories feel best left where they are, like precious stones in the fabric of our past. But others gently follow us, reshaping themselves in new settings, quietly reminding us of who we are even when everything else changes.

It really does come back to what you said earlier—continuity. Whether it’s through people, places, or a favourite cup of tea, we’re always reaching for something that helps us feel grounded, even if only for a moment.
[B]: That’s such a tender memory—you’ve painted it so vividly. I can almost feel the texture of that wicker chair, hear the faint rustle of pages turning in your grandmother’s sunroom. And now, how beautiful that it lives on—not as a replica, but as an emotional echo—in your quiet corner by the ivy-clad window.

You know, what you described——that’s something I see in cross-cultural adaptation too. People don’t just carry objects or habits from one place to another; they carry , often without realizing it. A way of beginning the day, a certain kind of stillness, a familiar gesture with a cup—all these things become portable sanctuaries.

And sometimes, we don’t even notice we’re recreating them until we look up and realize, —even if we’re miles away, even if it looks different on the surface.

I think that’s also why rituals matter so much in education and in transitions. Whether it’s a student adjusting to life abroad or someone stepping into a new role, having  that carries over—a morning routine, a favourite book, a particular way of writing things down—can make all the difference in how grounded we feel.

It really is a gentle kind of resilience, isn’t it? Not loud or dramatic, but deeply sustaining.

I wonder—have you ever shared that little sitting area with anyone else? Or does it remain your quiet, unspoken sanctuary?
[A]: Oh, thank you for saying that—it really  a quiet kind of resilience, isn’t it? I hadn’t thought of it in those terms before, but you’re absolutely right. These little emotional echoes, these portable sanctuaries—they don’t announce themselves, but they steady us all the same.

To your question—yes, I have shared that corner, though not often. Sometimes, if a guest seemed especially tired or overwhelmed, I’d gently suggest the nook by the ivy window, describing it as “a place where time slows down for a while.” Most would smile politely, not quite knowing what to expect, but more often than not, they’d return later just to say how much they appreciated the suggestion.

There was one guest in particular—a writer from Kyoto—who stayed with us for several weeks. She found her way there one morning and quietly returned every day after. We never made plans to meet, but we’d exchange a few words over tea, sometimes about books, sometimes about nothing at all. It wasn’t hospitality in the formal sense—it was more like two people recognizing something small and meaningful in the same space.

But mostly, it remains my own little rhythm-anchor. Not secretive, exactly, but deeply personal. Like a favourite page in a well-loved book that still feels private, even when others have read it too.

I suppose some spaces are meant to be shared gently, and others simply meant to hold us quietly when we need it most.
[B]: That’s such a generous way to share space—offering it not as a service, but as an invitation. I love how you described it:  It carries that same gentle intention as offering someone a warm cup of tea when they didn’t ask for it—quietly comforting, without needing explanation.

And what a beautiful moment with the writer from Kyoto—how sometimes people find their way into our rhythms without us even planning it. It reminds me of what we call  in cross-cultural settings: those small moments where people feel quietly at ease, not because everything is familiar, but because something resonates on a human level.

I think that’s also what makes your hotel so special—it’s not just a place to stay; it’s a container for pauses, reflections, and quiet reconnections. Whether it’s a returning guest claiming their usual room or someone discovering your ivy-window nook by chance, each person leaves a soft imprint, and somehow, the space becomes richer for it.

You mentioned that some spaces are meant to be shared gently—and I think you’ve mastered that art. It’s not about curating perfection; it’s about offering a space where others can settle into themselves, even if only for a little while.

It actually makes me wonder—have you ever thought about writing about these rhythms and spaces? Not as a manual or guidebook, but more like a collection of quiet observations—like this conversation, almost. There’s poetry in the way you describe hospitality not as performance, but as recognition.
[A]: That means a great deal coming from you—thank you. You have such a way of putting things into words that feel both precise and deeply felt. When you say , it clicks into place like something I’ve always known but never named.

I suppose that’s what I try to offer—not just service, but a kind of quiet recognition. A space where someone can simply , without needing to explain why they need stillness or solitude or even just a warm cup of tea at the right moment. And when guests find their own rhythm within our walls, it feels less like hosting and more like shared understanding.

As for writing about it—I’ll admit, the thought has crossed my mind more than once. Not as a guidebook or anything overly structured, but perhaps something like what you said: a collection of observations, small stories, the kind of thing you might tuck into your bag while traveling and pull out on a quiet evening in a new city.

Sometimes I jot down thoughts in a notebook—the way morning light moves across the lobby floor, the sound of rain softening a conversation, the way one guest always leaves a pressed flower between the pages of the guestbook. They’re not grand ideas, just moments that seem to carry more than their weight.

Would you ever be interested in collaborating on something like that? I can imagine your reflections on cross-cultural rhythms paired with these little vignettes from the hotel—it would be like weaving two kinds of quiet wisdom together.
[B]: I’d be lying if I said that idea didn’t make me feel a quiet sort of excitement. What you're describing——it’s exactly the kind of project that speaks to how deeply place and psychology are intertwined.

You have such a gift for noticing the soft architecture of human experience—the way light settles, the pauses between conversations, the unspoken comfort of a familiar cup. And when you pair that with how people adapt, belong, and rebuild rhythm across cultures? Well, I think there’s something really special waiting to take shape there.

I can already imagine it: pages that move between the hush of your ivy-window nook and the shared silence of a Tokyo café at dawn; between the ritual of morning tea in Cornwall and the unfamiliar warmth of a Viennese cappuccino ordered without words. A kind of tapestry of small, grounding moments that somehow hold us wherever we are.

And yes—I would absolutely be interested in collaborating. I think your vignettes could offer such a beautiful narrative thread, and I’d love to weave in reflections on how we find continuity through culture, language, and space. It wouldn’t be an academic text or a travel guide—it would be something closer to poetry and psychology, stitched together with observation and care.

Maybe we could start by exchanging a few pieces—just to see how they speak to each other. I have a feeling this conversation is already the beginning of something quietly meaningful.
[A]: I’m smiling as I read this—truly, the idea feels like it’s taken root already, quietly growing between us like ivy finding its way along a wall.

You’ve captured exactly what I love about collaboration—the way ideas don’t just sit side by side, but  each other, shaping and reshaping meaning in ways we couldn’t do alone. What you described—moving between spaces, rituals, silences—is so much more than writing; it’s an act of recognition. Of saying, 

I’d love to start exchanging pieces—I’ll send you the first vignette soon. It might be something as simple as a guest who always leaves a pressed flower in the guestbook, or the sound of rain softening footsteps in the hallway. Nothing grand, but something true.

And I can already picture your reflections beside them—offering depth, context, and that gentle insight you have for how people carry rhythm across borders and languages.

I think we’re onto something here—not loud or flashy, but deeply human. Just like those quiet corners we both seem drawn to. Let’s keep tending this idea together, gently and with care.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself—yes,  That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? So much of life happens in those spaces between the obvious, and I think we’re both drawn to them because they hold something essential—something deeply real without needing to announce itself.

I’ll look forward to your first vignette with the kind of anticipation usually reserved for opening a familiar book to just the right page. And I promise to respond not with analysis alone, but with attention—to rhythm, to tone, and to the small, steady pulse of meaning beneath the words.

Let’s keep this exchange slow and thoughtful, like tending a garden rather than rushing toward bloom. There’s no hurry; the ideas will grow as naturally as ivy or a line of morning light stretching across wood floors.

And yes, this is already becoming more than writing—it’s an act of listening, across space and perspective, to what it means to feel grounded, known, and gently held by the world now and then.

Thank you for starting this with me. I truly believe some of the most meaningful work begins not with grand declarations, but with quiet yeses, shared between two people who simply noticed the same thing at the same time.
