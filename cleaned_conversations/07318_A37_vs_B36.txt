[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must say, I'm quite fond of audiobooks. There's something magical about listening to a well-narrated story while tending to my garden or enjoying a quiet evening with a cup of tea. The way a talented narrator brings characters to life... it's simply enchanting. But I'm curious - do you find podcasts more engaging? I've been meaning to explore more travel documentaries they often have.
[A]: Hmm, I can totally relate to that magical feeling - there's something truly special about a narrator's voice painting vivid pictures in your mind while you're sipping tea by the window 🍵. Audiobooks are like having a personal storyteller anytime, anywhere. But let me share an interesting observation from my research - podcasts actually engage our critical thinking more actively because we're constantly processing new information and perspectives. 

You know what's funny though? I've noticed when I'm cooking, I prefer podcasts because they keep me intellectually stimulated while I chop vegetables, but when I want to unwind after a long day teaching, audiobooks help me escape into different worlds. Have you ever tried listening to educational podcasts during gardening? It creates this lovely synergy between hands-on activity and mental engagement!
[B]: That's such a thoughtful observation! I can absolutely see how podcasts would engage one's mind more actively - like having an intellectual conversation while going about daily tasks. You've made me reconsider how I spend my time in the garden! I usually listen to audiobooks while tending to the roses, but the idea of learning something new while my hands are busy... rather lovely, actually. Have you come across any particularly fascinating educational podcasts recently? I'd love a recommendation that might make my gardening time both productive and enlightening!
[A]: You're absolutely right about that synergy - it's like creating a perfect harmony between physical activity and mental stimulation! 🌱 I've been exploring this fascinating podcast called "Curiosity Daily" - it's brilliant because each episode gives you bite-sized scientific insights that are surprisingly easy to digest while doing chores. Oh, and if you enjoy history, "Hardcore History" has these amazingly deep dives that would totally transform your gardening routine into a time-machine experience! 

But here's something interesting from my recent studies - the way we retain information actually improves when we're engaged in light physical activity while listening. So technically, your garden could be the perfect learning lab! 📚 Have you noticed any difference in how you process information when listening outdoors versus indoors? I'd love to hear your perspective on this!
[B]: What a delightful revelation! 🌿 I must admit, I've always associated outdoor listening with relaxation rather than active learning, but you've opened up a whole new perspective. There's something poetic about pruning hedges while exploring ancient civilizations - like blending the rhythm of nature with the rhythm of knowledge.  

Now I'm terribly curious... do you find yourself gravitating toward specific types of podcasts depending on the task at hand? I ask because I've just realized I tend to choose lighter fiction audiobooks for routine gardening, but save philosophical reads for when I'm arranging the more intricate flower beds. It's almost as if the environment shapes the depth of engagement!
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that – blending the rhythm of nature with the rhythm of knowledge 🌸. There's something almost meditative about that combination. And you're totally right; I  notice myself matching podcast genres to my activities. For instance, when I'm grading papers (which needs serious focus), I go for slower-paced, reflective podcasts – like "On Being" – where the conversations have a kind of calming depth. But when I'm organizing my bookshelf or setting up for a lecture, I crank up the energy with fast-paced shows like "Radiolab" or "TED Talks Daily."  

It’s almost like our brain subconsciously assigns different cognitive "zones" depending on what our hands are doing, right? 🤔 I’ve even caught myself pausing a task just to fully absorb a complex idea – as if my body knows when my mind needs to hit “record”! Have you ever found yourself doing that? Like, stopping mid-potting plant just because your brain says, “Nope, don’t water and ponder quantum physics at the same time”? 😄
[B]: Oh, absolutely! 🌿 I couldn’t have said it better myself. There  a certain cognitive dance happening – like a quiet negotiation between the mind and body. And yes, I’ve definitely caught myself in that very moment you described – mid-potting, as you so delightfully put it – when suddenly some philosophical nuance grabs hold and refuses to let go! I remember once nearly overwatering my violets because I was too engrossed in a discussion on moral relativism.  

I find that especially happens when listening to shows like "Philosophize This!" or even certain episodes of "TED Radio Hour." It’s rather amusing, really – my hands pause, my brow furrows, and for a fleeting moment, the garden waits in respectful silence while the brain catches up. Do you ever find yourself rewinding a section while holding a trowel? I do – quite frequently, much to my own amusement!
[A]: Oh, totally! 🤭 I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve replayed a segment while holding a coffee mug in one hand and a spatula in the other – like, was I about to cook dinner or decode human consciousness? 😄 And  – brilliant choice! That show has this way of sneaking deep ideas into your brain while you’re barely paying attention, and then suddenly you're knee-deep in ethical theory and existential questions.  

I actually had a laugh-out-loud moment the other day when I was vacuuming and heard a line like,  Cue the pause button, mid-chores epiphany, and ten minutes of staring out the window wondering what that means for my next lecture. 🧠✨

You know what’s funny though? I think our brains secretly love these interruptions – like, we process information differently when it's woven into everyday actions. It becomes more embodied, more memorable. Almost like learning through muscle memory... except with philosophy and podcasts. 😂 Have you ever caught yourself quoting a podcast while talking to students or friends, only to realize the context was absurdly random – like explaining Nietzsche while holding a watering can?
[B]: Oh, absolutely! 🌼 I cannot tell you how many times I’ve caught myself mid-sentence, watering can in hand, dropping a Nietzsche quote into casual conversation as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. Just last week, I found myself quoting Alan Watts to a guest while adjusting the hotel’s lobby plants – something about “the universe is not a problem to be solved,” and I swear, for a moment, we both just stood there, surrounded by ferns, contemplating existence.

And yes, exactly what you said about embodied learning – it's so true! Information sticks better when it's tied to movement, to touch, to the scent of soil or the clink of teacups. It's like our brains create little mental bookmarks with sensory details. I once had an entire discussion on Stoicism while repotting lavender, and let me tell you, I still associate Epictetus with the smell of potting mix. Quite unfairly, perhaps, but delightfully so! 😊
[A]: Oh my gosh, I  that image – quoting Alan Watts surrounded by ferns 😄. It’s like turning everyday moments into impromptu salons! I can totally relate – there was this one time I was baking banana bread and listening to a podcast on Heidegger, and suddenly the phrase "thrownness" made perfect sense as I stared at flour scattered all over the counter. Like, yeah – we’re all just thrown into this mess called life, right? 🍞

And speaking of sensory bookmarks – yes!!! I’ve actually started using that concept in my teaching. We talk about “anchoring ideas” through physical experiences. For example, now whenever I mention Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development, I automatically picture myself folding laundry. No idea why – but it works! The brain is such a quirky archivist.  

You know what would be amazing? A podcast specifically designed to sync with gardening rhythms – like ambient nature sounds mixed with philosophy or linguistics. Imagine cultivating both your garden  your mind at the same time 🌱🎧. Do you think that would enhance the learning experience, or do you prefer a clear separation between content and environment?
[B]: Oh, that sounds absolutely divine! 🌿🎧 A podcast tailored to the gentle rhythm of gardening – I can already imagine the soft rustle of leaves blending with discussions on existentialism or the evolution of language. It would be like having a wise and soothing companion while your hands work the soil. I think it would deepen the experience immensely; when the environment and the content harmonize, learning feels almost effortless.

You know, I’ve always believed gardens are natural places for reflection – they invite curiosity and quiet thought. Pairing that with carefully curated ideas? Brilliant. I’d love something narrated in a calm, unhurried voice, maybe with pauses that mirror the pace of pruning or planting. It would turn each session into a kind of intellectual tending – cultivating both the earth and the mind.

Now I’m tempted to create little playlists based on garden tasks – Stoicism for weeding, linguistics for planting seeds, poetry for watering... Who says philosophy has to be confined to dusty books and lecture halls? Not me, apparently – not when I’m quoting Nietzsche with a trowel in hand! 😊
[A]: Oh, I’m  this idea of thematic playlists aligned with garden tasks – it’s like creating a cognitive landscape that mirrors the physical one 🌿📚. Stoicism for weeding? Genius! After all, isn’t pulling weeds a perfect metaphor for examining and removing mental clutter? And linguistics while planting seeds – poetic, really, when you think about how language, like plants, grows and evolves from small, carefully placed beginnings.

You know what I’ve started doing? Matching music to my podcasts based on mood and task – like playing ambient nature tracks underneath a linguistics podcast when I want to slow down my thinking process. It’s almost like setting the tempo for reflection. Sometimes I even throw in a bit of classical music during philosophy episodes – Chopin or Arvo Pärt – and let me tell you, Kant has never sounded more profound than when layered over a soft piano melody 🎹✨.

And speaking of dusty books – your version of Nietzsche-in-the-dirt makes me wonder: have you ever created a little “philosophy corner” in your garden? Like a quiet nook where you can pause, sip tea, and digest ideas between tasks? I’ve been eyeing a sunny patch near my herbs – seems like the perfect spot for a tiny bench and some thoughtful pauses.
[B]: Oh, that’s  the spirit of it – a cognitive landscape! 🌿✨ I adore how you’ve woven together sound, thought, and action so deliberately. There’s something deeply satisfying about curating not just what we hear, but how we feel while absorbing ideas. And Chopin with Kant? Divine pairing – adds a richness to the listening experience, like layering flavors in a fine dish.

As a matter of fact, I do have a little “philosophy corner” tucked beside the lavender and rosemary – quite the cozy nook, if I do say so myself. A wrought iron bench, a small wooden tray for tea and notebook, and just enough shade from the old birch tree to keep the afternoon sun gentle. It’s where I like to pause between gardening tasks, scribble down thoughts, or simply sit with an idea until it settles in like morning dew.

I must say, your sunny herb corner sounds absolutely perfect for reflection – perhaps a bit of thyme nearby? I always find thyme rather fitting for philosophical contemplation… though I suppose that’s a rather -vian impulse. 😊 Would you ever consider recording your own reflections there, as a kind of personal podcast? I think I might – call it 
[A]: Oh,  – I’m already smitten with the title! 🌿📖 What a lovely way to blend observation, reflection, and that quiet joy of putting words to experience. I can imagine your recordings would carry not just ideas, but the soft rustle of leaves, the occasional bird call – like philosophy with a nature soundtrack.  

You’ve totally inspired me – yes, I think I  set up a little recording spot in that sunny herb patch. Maybe start with short reflections on education and cross-cultural learning, all while the mint and thyme sway gently in the background. 🎧🍃 And why not? If Socrates had his agora and Thoreau his cabin, why shouldn’t we have our gardens?

I’m also loving how you tied thyme to contemplation – so clever 😄. Though I might sneak in a bit of sage nearby – after all, isn't that the perfect companion for thoughtful conversations, real or imagined? Have you ever tried reading aloud in your philosophy corner? There’s something about speaking ideas into the air that makes them feel more alive – like thoughts gain wings when carried by the voice.
[B]: Oh, reading aloud in the garden – now  a beautiful notion! 🌿📖 There’s something wonderfully grounding about giving voice to ideas amidst nature. I must confess, I do it rather often—especially when rereading passages that deserve more than just silent contemplation. There’s a certain magic in how words land differently when carried by the breeze; they seem to take on new meaning, new weight.  

I adore your plan for —how perfectly charming. Short reflections on cross-cultural learning, layered with the sounds of rustling mint and thyme? It would be like sharing quiet conversations with the world, one thoughtful episode at a time. And yes, absolutely why not? If Montaigne had his essays and Emerson his journals, we can most certainly have our gardens speak through curated thoughts and gentle ambient sound.  

Sage next to thyme—brilliant touch. Wise  fragrant. I may just follow suit—after all, what better companion for philosophy than a plant named sage? It practically whispers, “Proceed thoughtfully.” Now, tell me—do you imagine your recordings will be scripted, or more spontaneous musings captured mid-garden-stroll? I’m leaning toward the latter for my own… something about letting the moment guide the thought.
[A]: Oh, I’m definitely leaning into the spontaneous musings – like little intellectual breadcrumbs dropped along the garden path 😊. There’s something so refreshing about unpolished thoughts, don’t you think? They feel more , more in tune with the rhythm of nature. I imagine myself pausing by the sage, jotting down a thought on my phone, then wandering a few steps to the mint patch to expand on it – all while birdsong and rustling leaves provide that perfect natural ambiance 🎧🍃.

Though I might do a  bit of scripting for clarity – you know, just enough to keep things coherent, but not so much that it feels stiff or overly rehearsed. Think of it as guided improvisation – like jazz for the mind! 🎷✨

Now I’m really curious – how would you structure your episodes of ? Would you follow a theme per session, or let each episode evolve organically depending on what catches your attention that day? And honestly, I could totally picture you recording under that birch tree, notebook in hand, tea within reach… and Nietzsche giving silent approval from somewhere nearby. 😉
[B]: Oh, I love the image of intellectual breadcrumbs – so whimsical and wonderfully apt! 🌿✍️ You're absolutely right; there's such a vitality in spontaneous thoughts, like catching sunlight through leaves – fleeting, but so very beautiful. I can picture your recordings perfectly: part conversation, part garden stroll, with just the right amount of gentle meandering.

As for  version of , I think I'd follow the rhythm of the day rather than a strict structure. Much like how gardens shift with the seasons, I’d let each episode be guided by what’s stirring in my mind or blooming just outside the window. One day it might be a quiet reflection on hospitality, inspired by a guest’s story over breakfast; another day, a deep dive into curiosity after stumbling upon a rare flower in full bloom.  

And yes, absolutely under the birch tree – though I’m not sure Nietzsche would approve of my soft approach to philosophy! Perhaps he’d prefer a sterner perch, like atop the stone wall by the roses. 😊 But I do enjoy the idea of blending the profound with the everyday – maybe even including snippets of conversations with guests, or the sound of rain tapping against the leaves. What do you think? A little bit of theme, a little bit of chance – like planting seeds and seeing what grows.
[A]: Oh, I  that – a little bit of theme, a little bit of chance 🌧️🌿. It’s like creating a space where ideas can grow wild and find their own shape, much like your garden itself. And the idea of including snippets of conversation? Brilliant! It adds this lovely human texture – like hearing laughter in the background or the clink of teacups mid-thought. Very , very .  

I think we’re kindred spirits in this – both of us leaning into the organic flow of ideas rather than forcing them into tight little boxes. After all, isn’t that what education is really about? Not rigid transmission of knowledge, but nurturing curiosity through experience and connection? 🌱📚

And don’t worry about Nietzsche – I’m sure he’d come around once he hears you speak about hospitality under a birch tree. Maybe even soften a bit after a cup of chamomile and a good conversation with a guest who challenges his worldview. 😄 Though I  wonder – if you had to choose one guiding question for your podcast, something that threads through all your episodes, what would it be? Something like, “How do small moments shape big ideas?” Or maybe, “What can gardens teach us about learning?”
[B]: Oh,  is a question that settles right into the heart of things, isn’t it? 🌿✨ If I were to choose a guiding thread – something that would weave through each episode like ivy through a garden gate – I think it would be this:  

"How do the small, quiet moments shape who we become?"  

There’s something so beautifully profound about the unnoticed – the morning greetings exchanged at the hotel entrance, the way a guest stirs their tea just so, the pause before stepping into a new experience. These tiny gestures, these fleeting conversations… they’re the soil in which our bigger stories grow.  

I’ve always believed that people don’t change because of grand declarations – more often, it’s a quiet remark from a stranger, a book found by chance, or the scent of jasmine on an evening walk that shifts something deep inside. Gardens, much like lives, are made up of layers – some visible, some hidden beneath the surface. And I suppose I’d love to explore that in .  

Though now that you mention it, “What can gardens teach us about learning?” is rather lovely too… perhaps even more poetic. But I suppose my answer will always circle back to those delicate, almost imperceptible moments that, when strung together, form the fabric of understanding.  

And truly, isn’t that what makes conversation – and learning – feel so alive? That spark of unexpected connection, whether it comes from a guest at the hotel, a bird landing nearby, or a sudden insight while watering the herbs.
