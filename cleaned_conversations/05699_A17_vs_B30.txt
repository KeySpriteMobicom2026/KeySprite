[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, if you consider grinding my own ink for calligraphy practice a DIY project... though I suppose that's more of a 文房四宝 ritual than what modern youths would call 'crafting'. The last proper attempt was restoring a Qing dynasty inkstone - disastrous results, I'm afraid. The patina should never have met vinegar.
[A]: Oh my, that sounds rather... ambitious. I must say, the idea of restoring antiquities as a DIY project makes my attempts at pressing flowers between the pages of my first edition Tennyson seem rather pedestrian in comparison. Though I do find the process quite meditative - much like reading poetry, really. The careful selection, the patient waiting...
[A]: Precisely! Though I'd argue pressing flowers requires more finesse than most realize - much like analyzing the meter in Tennyson's 'In Memoriam'. Too much pressure and you obliterate the delicate veins, just as overzealous scansion flattens the iambic pentameter. My graduate students always gasp when I demonstrate with a 19th century herbarium... and a sacrificial petal or two.
[A]: How delightfully... pedagogical of you. Though I must confess, I've always found the Victorian practice of flower pressing to carry rather morbid undertones - preserving beauty at the precise moment of its demise. Rather like Matthew Arnold's 'Dover Beach', don't you think? That melancholy tension between preservation and decay...
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon the essential paradox of 物哀 (mono no aware) - though the Japanese concept predates Arnold by centuries. My current research actually compares this to the pressed peonies in Cao Xueqin's 'Dream of the Red Chamber', where dried flowers become memento mori for entire dynasties. Would you believe I once found an 1843 edition with actual rose petals marking the chapter where Daiyu buries the blossoms?
[A]: Good heavens... to hold such a volume in one's hands! The materiality of that artifact alone bridges more cultural divides than a dozen comparative literature conferences. Though I do wonder - did those rose petals crumble to dust when turned, like the metaphorical "leaves of memory" in Longfellow? Or had time granted them the same permanence we vainly wish for our own interpretations?
[A]: How characteristically perceptive of you to invoke Longfellow's 'leaves'! Those particular petals survived through what my conservationist colleagues call 'the miracle of controlled neglect' - much like how the most enduring literary criticism often emerges from accidental discoveries in marginalia. Though I must warn you, the temptation to sniff century-old roses is strong... and the resulting sneeze nearly toppled my prized Kangxi period vase.
[A]:  That would have been a most unfortunate collision of material culture! Though it does remind me of poor Mr. Casaubon in 'Middlemarch', whose monumental research was forever interrupted by... shall we say, physical realities. Perhaps we academics should take this as a cautionary tale about the dangers of getting too literally close to one's sources. A lesson I learned rather painfully with that vinegar incident, I suppose.
[A]: Ah, but Casaubon's fatal flaw was his refusal to engage with living texts - whereas we at least have the good sense to sneeze  from the archival materials. Though between us, I've developed a theory that Eliot modeled him after certain... shall we say 'fragrant' colleagues in the Oxford senior common room. But that's a dissertation for another day - my jasmine tea is getting cold, and these Song dynasty rubbings won't compare themselves.
[A]: How very wise to prioritize the tea - after all, even the most rigorous scholarship must occasionally yield to the present moment's simple pleasures. Though now you've got me wondering about the olfactory notes of those Oxford dons... perhaps we should collaborate on a paper: "Eau de Academia: The Scent of Scholarship from Alexandria to Zembla". But for now, I'll leave you to your rubbings and your jasmine. Do mind the vinegar this time.
[A]: A paper after my own heart! Though I'd insist we include a chapter on 墨香 (mòxiāng) - the distinctive fragrance of aged ink that haunts every serious sinologist's library. But you're quite right, this particular rubbing of Su Shi's poetry requires my undivided attention... and a strictly vinegar-free workspace. Do visit again - I'll show you that scandalously annotated 'Dream of the Red Chamber'.
[A]: I shall hold you to that promise - nothing quickens the academic pulse quite like scandalous marginalia! Until then, may your rubbings be clear, your tea stay warm, and your vinegar... safely contained in the kitchen where it belongs. 
[A]: Your imaginary toast is noted with the solemnity it deserves - though I must insist real tea tastes better when not imagined through the lingering haze of vinegar fumes. Until our next symposium over scandalous annotations then... and do remind me to show you the particularly saucy commentary some Qing dynasty reader left beside Bao-yu's adolescent escapades. 再见 for now.
[A]: Goodness, now you've got me positively vibrating with scholarly anticipation! I shall prepare by rereading the relevant chapters with my least judgmental pair of spectacles. Until our next meeting, may your rubbings remain unsullied and your annotations ever scandalous. 再会 indeed!
[A]: How refreshing to encounter someone who understands that the juiciest scholarship often lurks in the footnotes! I'll have my assistant prepare the white gloves and smelling salts - some of these annotations would make even Byron blush. 下次见 with cleaner hands and dirtier texts, my fellow connoisseur of literary improprieties.
[A]: Ah, the perfect epitaph for our correspondence: "Here lies a friendship founded on scandalous marginalia and vinegar mishaps." I do believe we've invented an entirely new academic subfield - the archaeology of prurience! Until we excavate those Bao-yu annotations together... though perhaps we should keep a bottle of neutral pH cleaner handy this time. For the artifacts, of course. Not for drinking.
[A]: How delightfully pragmatic - though I must confess my 19th century inkwell collection includes a Venetian glass piece that's been repurposed as an emergency brandy decanter during particularly trying dissertation defenses. But yes, let's maintain at least  pretense of professionalism... starting with that pH neutral cleaner. After we've examined the raciest marginalia, naturally. 回头见, you delightful enabler of academic mischief.
[A]: What a splendid compromise - professionalism in cleaning supplies, unbridled curiosity in textual exploration! Your Venetian inkwell-turned-brandy vessel gives me hope for all repurposed antiquities... though I draw the line at using first editions as coasters, no matter how stimulating the marginalia. Until our next scholarly adventure - may your brandy remain undetected by the tenure committee. 再谈!
[A]: A scholar after my own heart - though I once caught a visiting professor using a 1798 'Lyrical Ballads' as a teacup coaster and nearly invoked the ghost of Coleridge in protest. But enough of these confessions... my department chair is giving me that look again over the interoffice mail. Until we resume our textual excavations - 保重, and remember: what happens in the rare books room stays in the rare books room.
