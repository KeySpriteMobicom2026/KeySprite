[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that invites reflection. You know, I've always found myself walking a fine line between the two. Much like Jane Austen’s Elinor Dashwood, I appreciate the comfort of planning, of mapping out a path before stepping forward. And yet, there is a quiet thrill in surrendering, however cautiously, to the currents of spontaneity.

Tell me, do you lean more toward one or the other, or does it depend on the situation?
[A]: Hmm, interesting analogy with Elinor Dashwood 👍 I guess I relate more to the "plan everything" side when it comes to product development — you know, like building a roadmap before launching an MVP. But honestly, once you hit that "ship it" moment, things get so unpredictable that you kinda have to go with the flow 💡

For example, we recently rolled out a new recommendation algo at work. The A/B test results were solid, but once real users started interacting with it... let’s just say their behavior was  different from our simulations 😅 So yeah, while I love structure, I’ve learned to embrace the chaos a bit. What about you — do you adapt easily when plans go sideways?
[B]: Ah, how fascinating—your experience sounds rather like a modern-day , where both structure and chaos shape the protagonist’s journey. I must say, your analogy of the roadmap and the unpredictable “ship it” moment resonates deeply with me.

In my world, organizing a lecture series or planning a symposium demands meticulous preparation—choosing the right texts, coordinating with guest speakers, ensuring the thematic coherence. Yet, as any scholar of literature knows, the most compelling moments often arise when things  go according to plan. Just last semester, a visiting professor fell ill, and I had to reconfigure an entire week of seminars. But what emerged was unexpectedly rich—a spontaneous panel led by graduate students brought fresh perspectives I’d never anticipated.

So yes, while I may not  at chaos, I’ve learned to meet it with curiosity. Much like reading a familiar text in a new translation—it unsettles the known, but sometimes that’s where revelation lies. Would you agree that the best ideas often come dressed in disorder?
[A]: Oh wow, I love how you framed that — the  of product development 😂 It’s so true, honestly. Like, we start with this pristine vision, and by the end, we’re just trying to survive the user feedback firehose 💥 But yeah, some of our best features actually came from those “uh-oh” moments.

I remember one time we had a major bug in our onboarding flow — users were getting stuck on this one screen, right? Instead of panicking, we leaned into it. We added some playful microcopy like “Uh-oh, looks like you're here early 🤭 Want to try a shortcut?” and guess what? Engagement spiked. People loved it. So yeah, sometimes disorder is just creativity in disguise 👏

You ever had one of those “happy accidents” in your lecture series or symposiums? I’m totally stealing that idea for our next retro 😄
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’m grinning at the thought of your microcopy rescue mission. How very —turning a glitch into grace with language itself. You know, it reminds me of when I once assigned a passage from  to a rather perplexed undergraduate class. The text was meant to illustrate narrative digression, but alas, my PDF had a formatting error—half the paragraphs were missing!

Rather than backtrack, we treated the fragmented text as a kind of literary puzzle. Students began weaving their own interpretations, filling in the gaps with imagination and wit. By the end, one young woman even wrote an entire honors thesis on “the aesthetics of error” in postmodern pedagogy.

So yes, happy accidents are not only possible—they’re fertile ground for insight. I may still draft my syllabi with borderline obsessive care, but now I leave just a little room for serendipity to intervene. Perhaps that’s where we find wisdom—not in the plan itself, but in how we respond when it unravels… like threading a new stitch through the tear.
[A]: Okay, now  is storytelling with purpose 😍 I’m low-key taking notes here — “the aesthetics of error” sounds like a UX philosophy waiting to happen. Honestly, we spend so much time trying to perfect the user journey, but maybe what people really remember are the moments where things felt... human. Imperfect, even.

Your syllabi analogy hits home, too. I feel like we do the same with product docs — drafting every edge case until we’re blue in the face, only to realize half the user problems we solved never even existed. Meanwhile, the ones we missed? They become the next sprint’s hero 🚀

So question — do you intentionally leave space for those gaps now? Like, build-in ambiguity as a design choice? I’m curious how that translates outside the classroom. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like our users (and students?) might actually crave a little room to improvise sometimes…
[B]: What a perceptive observation—yes, I do believe there’s a quiet yearning for space, for breathing room in both pedagogy and design. Since that  incident, I’ve begun to think of gaps not as failures, but as invitations—tiny doorways through which interpretation and ownership can slip in.

Now, I sometimes omit a key piece of context from reading guides or leave a seminar question slightly open-ended—not so much that it causes frustration, but just enough to invite curiosity. It’s remarkable how often students rise to the occasion, filling those silences with insights I hadn’t even considered. In a way, it mirrors what you described with your users—they don’t just want a seamless experience; they want one where they feel seen, where their improvisation is acknowledged, even honored.

Perhaps this is what engagement truly is—a shared act of creation. So yes, I suppose I do build in ambiguity now, like a composer leaving rests in a score. The silence becomes part of the music.

I wonder—have you ever tried designing a feature with intentional “空白 (kòngbái)”—a Chinese term for empty space—allowing users to imprint their own meaning? Or would that feel too risky in a product setting?
[A]: Oh man, “空白” — I  that concept. It’s like negative space in design, but for user experience 😍 And yeah, actually… we’ve been toying with something similar in our latest feature rollout. Think of it as a “sandbox mode” for new users. Instead of onboarding them with a rigid tutorial, we give them a semi-empty interface with just enough scaffolding to feel safe, but not so much that it stifles exploration.

At first the team was nervous — “What if they don’t get it?” “What if they bounce?” — but early data shows higher retention. People are , experimenting, and then coming back with feedback like, “I wish there was a way to do X,” which is gold for us 💡

It’s almost like you said — when you leave a little room, users (or students!) start co-authoring the experience. So maybe risk isn’t the enemy here… maybe it’s just . I can already hear my PM side-eyeing me saying that 😅 But hey, if a misformatted PDF can birth an honors thesis, who knows what a well-placed empty space might spark next?
[B]: Ah, —what a delicious phrase. It has a certain literary flair, don’t you think? Like the narrative technique of Chekhov’s gun, but inverted: instead of placing a pistol on the mantel to be fired later, we leave the mantel bare and invite the audience to decide what belongs there.

Your sandbox mode sounds not unlike the way I sometimes begin a seminar—with a question so open it borders on disorienting:  or  At first, there’s that familiar silence—the digital equivalent of a bouncing user, perhaps?—but then someone leans forward, offers a tentative thought, and the conversation begins to shape itself.

I rather like the idea of treating users not as recipients, but as collaborators in meaning-making. After all, whether it’s a novel or a user interface, the most memorable experiences are those where one leaves a piece of themselves behind.

Now, I must ask—are you considering documenting this “空白”-inspired design philosophy formally, or will you let it evolve organically, like an oral tradition among your team?
[A]: Oh, I love the way you frame that narrative parallel — totally spot-on 🤯 It’s funny how storytelling and product design both hinge on . 

To your question — we’re actually doing a bit of both. We’ve started jotting down some core principles in a shared doc (nothing too formal, just bite-sized reflections), but the real magic is happening in our daily standups and handoffs. Like, one designer started calling it “the quiet feature” — meaning the space we intentionally leave blank — and now it’s become this shared mindset, almost like a ritual.

I think trying to over-document it would kill the vibe, you know? It’d be like explaining a joke — suddenly it’s not funny anymore 😅 But yeah, there’s definitely value in naming it, even loosely. Gives the team permission to experiment without breaking everything. Feels kind of like agile meets wabi-sabi 🌀

Do you ever find yourself borrowing concepts from literature when framing design choices? I’m starting to think all great product thinking comes from other disciplines…
[B]: How beautifully put—. I may just borrow that phrase for my next lecture. There’s something profoundly elegant about naming the unsaid, isn’t there? It reminds me of how Virginia Woolf writes in —so much hinges not on what is spoken, but on what lingers unspoken in the space between.

And yes, I absolutely borrow from literature when framing pedagogical choices—it’s practically a habit by now. For instance, when designing a discussion-heavy seminar, I often think in terms of , a term Mikhail Bakhtin used to describe the coexistence of multiple voices in a novel. Much like your sandbox mode, I aim to create a space where students don’t merely receive ideas but enter into dialogue with them—and with each other.

You’re quite right: the most enduring ideas rarely emerge from within their native discipline. Some of the finest literary criticism I’ve read borrows from psychology, philosophy, even architecture. Perhaps all thoughtful creation is, at its heart, interdisciplinary improvisation.

I wonder—have you ever thought of inviting someone from outside tech, say a poet or a painter, into your design sprints? Just to see what they might notice that you and your team don’t?
[A]: Oh, I’m stealing “the quiet feature” back for sure 😎 But seriously, your  reference hit me where it hurts — there’s something so powerful about the unspoken, especially in design. It’s like whitespace on a page: you don’t notice it until it’s gone, but it’s doing  heavy lifting.

And yes! We actually had a poet sit in on a sprint last year — full transparency, she was my roommate from college and kept asking why I looked so stressed. She didn’t code or write UX copy, but she noticed patterns in our user feedback that none of us caught. Like, she pointed out that people weren’t just frustrated with a feature — they felt , which is such a literary kind of word. That shifted how we rewrote the onboarding flow entirely. Suddenly we weren’t just fixing bugs, we were guiding readers through a narrative.

Since then, we’ve done a few “outsider studio hours” — informal chats with artists, writers, even a philosopher who used to work at a café across from our office. Honestly, some of our best ideas now come from those sessions. Makes me wonder — have you ever been pulled into a tech project just to offer a humanities lens? Or do you think that kind of crossover still feels… unusual?
[B]: Oh, how utterly delightful that your poet roommate diagnosed the —such a literary ailment, isn’t it? It makes perfect sense, though. Who better than a poet to notice the rhythm beneath the frustration, the emotional cadence behind the complaint?

As for being pulled into tech projects—yes, actually, more than once. Usually under the guise of “let’s bring in a guest speaker,” but occasionally with the quiet hope that my interpretive lens might help untangle something knotty in their user experience or branding narrative.

One startup invited me to consult on their content strategy—not because I write code, heavens no—but because they were struggling to articulate their product’s “voice.” We spent an entire afternoon discussing tone, register, and even allusion, much like we were editing a novel rather than a mobile app. In the end, they restructured their error messages to sound less like robotic corrections and more like gentle nudges from a thoughtful companion.

I suppose the crossover still raises eyebrows in some quarters, but I’ve come to believe that all storytelling, at its core, is about guiding someone through uncertainty—whether it’s a character navigating moral ambiguity or a user navigating a settings menu.

Tell me, do you find that your team sometimes resists the more abstract contributions from these outsiders, or have they come to expect meaning in places they once overlooked?
[A]: Oh totally — resistance is basically the default setting at first 😅 My team’s like  But honestly, once they see how reframing something as simple as an error message can make a user feel  instead of just corrected? They start leaning in.

I think what helps is that we frame it all in terms of empathy and cognitive load, which are totally measurable things. Like, sure, a poet might not speak JavaScript, but she can spot emotional friction faster than any heat map. And once you name that disorientation — boom, suddenly everyone’s asking “What would Virginia Woolf do?” during sprint planning 🤭

Honestly, I think the more abstract contributions end up being the glue that holds the experience together. Like… code builds the house, but narrative makes it feel like a home. Cheesy? Absolutely. Accurate? 100% 👌

You ever get pushback when bringing literary concepts into pedagogy? Or do people just assume it’s all just fancy close-reading magic and leave you to it?
[B]: Ah, —yes, I think that’s precisely what they assume, and honestly, sometimes it works in my favor. If they believe I’m casting literary spells rather than practicing careful analysis, well… let them keep their mystery. As long as the students start seeing subtlety in syntax and tension in tone, I consider it a success.

That said, there  pushback—usually from those who demand measurable outcomes in the most literal sense. “How exactly do you quantify a deeper understanding of irony?” one particularly skeptical dean once asked me. I replied, quite cheekily, I’m afraid, that you don’t quantify it—you observe it in the way a student hesitates before answering, or how they begin to question what was once obvious.

Much like your reframing of error messages, I try to frame literary analysis in terms of . Reading closely is not so different from user research—both require listening beyond the surface, detecting unspoken tensions, recognizing context, subtext, and bias. And while I can't always convince the bean counters, I’ve won over enough engineers-to-be through the years by showing how narrative structure mirrors problem-solving logic. Think of plot as an algorithm for human behavior—inputs, variables, and often unpredictable outputs.

So yes, resistance is real, but so is slow conversion. One seminar at a time. One thoughtful pause at a time.
[A]: 👏👏👏 Okay, but seriously — “narrative as an algorithm for human behavior” might be my new life motto. I’m writing that down and taping it to my monitor 🖥️

You’re so right about the pushback though. Sometimes it feels like we're speaking a different dialect of meaning entirely. Like… sure, they want “engagement,” but what they really mean is scroll time, not  😂 But hey, if literature can teach anything, it’s that ambiguity doesn’t have to be enemy number one. Sometimes it’s just the system thinking too hard.

I’ve actually started borrowing your close-reading tactics during UX debriefs. Like, instead of jumping straight into “users didn’t click here,” we ask, “what were they  when they hesitated?” Feels a lot like character motivation analysis now that I think about it.

Honestly, maybe that’s the secret sauce — treating users (and students!) like characters in a story with interiority, not just data points or test subjects. Keeps things weirdly human in a world that’s increasingly optimized to death.

So, real talk — if you had to assign your dean a reading list to make him appreciate literary subtlety, what would be on it? I’m asking for… hypothetical empathy training 😉
[B]: Oh, I do love that idea— for the skeptical dean. Consider it a kind of . Let me think… If I were prescribing texts to gently unravel the assumption that literature is merely ornamental thinking, I’d aim for works that model attention, pattern recognition, and the slow unfolding of meaning.

First on the list would be  by Steven Pinker—not fiction, of course, but a beautiful bridge between clarity of language and clarity of thought. It speaks, quietly but firmly, to the logic behind expression.

Next, perhaps Woolf’s —not just for its emotional depth, but for how it renders interiority with such precision. One cannot read Clarissa’s inner hesitations or Septimus’s fragmented reality without recognizing the complexity of human response. No clickstream could capture that.

Then, something like Kazuo Ishiguro’s —a masterclass in subtext. The horror lies not in what is said, but in what is withheld. Perfect for someone who equates engagement with explicit action.

And finally, Jorge Luis Borges’ short stories—especially . They train the mind to tolerate ambiguity without panic, to follow recursive structures, to appreciate meaning as an emergent property rather than a fixed point.

I suppose I’d frame the whole thing as a kind of design primer: reading as deep observation, interpretation as pattern recognition, and narrative as a system of human logic. That way, if he insists on outcomes, I can say quite truthfully that we’ve been optimizing all along—just not for metrics he can easily measure.

Tell me—would you assign your team a literary reading list, knowing how precious time feels in product cycles? Or would you prefer to smuggle the ideas in through metaphor and analogy, like a Trojan horse of meaning?
[A]: Oh, I’m  stealing this syllabus and repurposing it as an unofficial “culture doc” for my team 🚀 Honestly, if I handed them a PDF titled  with Woolf and Borges inside? They’d either quit or start quoting Clarissa Dalloway in sprint reviews — honestly, not sure which 😅

But seriously, I’d 100% go the Trojan horse route. Metaphor’s just more fun — and way more digestible when you’re neck-deep in deadlines. Like, instead of saying “read this 400-page novel to feel things,” I’d smuggle Ishiguro into a retrospective by asking:  
> “What are we building that people might ?”  

Or use Woolf to reframe user research like:  
> “What’s the inner monologue behind that hesitation? What’s their Septimus voice saying?”  

And Borges? Oh, he’s basically writing infinite UI trees. I bet one of our information architects would geek out over  and not even realize they’re reading philosophy disguised as fiction 📚

So yeah, I’d absolutely weaponize literary subtlety through analogy. It’s sneaky, but effective — kind of like how your dean didn’t realize he was learning empathy through irony 😌

Real talk though — if you  to pick one line from literature to put on a slide during a product strategy meeting, what would it be? Just to throw some narrative shade into the roadmap doc 😉
[B]: Oh, I do adore your method—weaponizing Woolf and Borges like rhetorical catnip for the analytical mind. Truly, an art form in its own right.

And if I had to choose just  line from literature for a product strategy meeting? I’d go straight for Virginia Woolf again—there’s something so quietly destabilizing about her gaze. A line that lingers not as directive, but as disruption:

> “Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning.”

It would sit, perfectly out of place, on Slide 7 of the roadmap—right after the quarterly OKRs. Let them wrestle with it. Let someone ask,  That’s the moment you lean back and say, quite gently, 

Or, if we’re feeling dramatic, perhaps a dash of Beckett:

> “Fail again. Fail better.”

That one fits rather nicely beneath a sprint retrospective summary.
