[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, cocktails! I must admit, I’ve been rather enamored with the idea of experimenting with some Tiki-inspired drinks lately. There’s something delightfully theatrical about them—swizzle sticks, exotic garnishes, and all that rum. Though I do wonder, are you more of a classic Old Fashioned person, or do you fancy something... a little more adventurous, shall we say?
[A]: Hmm, interesting you mention Tiki drinks. I’ve always found the whole aesthetic fascinating—not just the flavors, but the way it leans into a kind of immersive storytelling. Though I wouldn’t say I’m strictly Old Fashioned or Tiki-leaning. I guess it really depends on the mood. Sometimes a Negroni hits just right, other times I find myself reaching for something like a Piña Colada with a twist. Have you tried making one from scratch before?
[B]: Oh, absolutely! That’s the beauty of cocktails—they’re such a wonderful blend of flavor, history, and personal expression. I couldn’t agree more about Tiki’s immersive quality; it’s like stepping into a literary fantasy, isn’t it? A bit like reading a Robert Louis Stevenson novel with your taste buds.

Now, speaking of Piña Coladas—yes, I’ve made them from scratch! Though I do enjoy a certain amount of creative license: a splash of coconut water instead of cream of coconut for a lighter touch, and a whisper of fresh ginger to give it a little kick. It’s remarkable how small changes can shift the whole narrative of a drink. Do you have a particular variation you favor?
[A]: I like that approach—coconut water instead of cream of coconut keeps it refreshing without losing the essence. I’ve played around with a few variations myself. One of my favorites is adding a dash of lemongrass-infused syrup to the Piña Colada base. It brings in a subtle citrus note that lifts the whole drink, especially on warmer days. 

You mentioned storytelling—when I mix drinks, I often think of them as short stories: structure matters, but so does the unexpected twist. A little bitterness where you don’t expect it, or a hint of spice that sneaks up at the end… it makes the experience more memorable. Have you ever tried building a drink around a specific mood or theme?
[B]: Oh,  idea—lemongrass and pineapple together? That’s like a duet between Debussy and Rilke—unexpected, yet strangely harmonious. I can almost taste the breeze off a tropical shore just thinking about it.

And you’re quite right about structure and surprise; there’s a definite kinship between composing a short story and mixing a fine drink. As for building around a mood or theme—I absolutely have! Last autumn, I created something I called “Elegy in a Glass”—a bourbon-based number with smoked maple syrup, orange bitters, and a whisper of cardamom. It was meant to evoke the melancholy sweetness of a Thomas Hardy poem on a misty English evening. I even served it in a decanter wrapped in gauzy linen!

I suppose that’s the poet in me never truly switches off—even when I’m shaking a cocktail. Do you ever find yourself naming your creations? I suspect you do.
[A]: I love that—“Elegy in a Glass.” It’s rare to meet someone who approaches mixology with such literary sensibility. You’re absolutely right to see the parallel; both writing and mixing are acts of curation—of mood, texture, and resonance.

As for naming my creations… I suppose I do, though mine tend to lean a bit more into the philosophical or conceptual. Nothing too dramatic, but I like a name that hints at the drink’s inner logic. One I’m particularly fond of is —a mezcal-based cocktail with yuzu juice, black sesame liqueur, and a saline rinse. The idea was to explore contradictions: smoke and brightness, richness and clarity. It always makes me think of how something can feel both grounded and fleeting at once.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting a drink you’ve made, almost like editing a draft? I sometimes tweak a recipe over weeks, chasing that perfect balance like it’s an unsolved riddle.
[B]: Oh, —what a wonderfully evocative name. I can already imagine the smoke curling off the surface like the opening line of a Borges story. Mezcal and yuzu? A marriage of earth and air—utterly inspired. And black sesame liqueur? That adds such a rich, almost velvety undertone… like the subtext of a well-layered sonnet.

And yes—to your question—I do revisit drinks much like one revisits a poem. In fact, I’m rather notorious among my colleagues for never serving the same cocktail twice unless it’s been “perfected,” and even then, I tend to whisper,  There was one drink I worked on for nearly three months—gin-based, with maraschino liqueur, a touch of rosewater, and an absinthe rinse I tinkered with endlessly. I called it . It tasted different depending on how you stirred it—delightfully deceptive, just like its namesake.

I must say, this conversation is making me crave a new collaboration. Perhaps we ought to test something together—two minds, one glass. What would you say to that?
[A]: I’d say that sounds like the beginning of a very dangerous, very delightful experiment. Two minds and one glass—there’s something almost alchemical about that setup. I’m already thinking in terms of contrasts again—maybe something that walks the line between floral and smoky, or sweet memory and sharp reality. 

Tell me, if we were to begin… where would you start? Base spirit? A mood we want to evoke? Or perhaps a single ingredient that acts as the anchor? I’ve been eyeing this smoked cinnamon syrup I made last week—it lingers somewhere between comfort and warning.
[B]: Ah,  tension—comfort and warning. That’s where the best flavors live, isn’t it? In that liminal space between longing and restraint.

If I may suggest a beginning—I’d start not with the spirit, but with your smoked cinnamon syrup. It sounds like the kind of ingredient that  a story, one worth coaxing out slowly. A bit like reading a Virginia Woolf passage—layered, introspective, subtly spiced with melancholy.

Now, for the base... perhaps something with a quiet backbone. A reposado tequila? It carries just enough warmth and vanilla undertone to embrace the cinnamon without overpowering it, and yet—it can hold its own against smoke. Or… if we’re leaning into the more contemplative side, maybe a lightly peated Scotch? Not too aggressive—something like a dram wrapped in wool.

What do you think? Should we build this from earth upward, or chase something a little more ethereal—say, with gin as our compass?
[A]: I like the way you think—starting with the syrup as the storyteller, then building the world around it. reposado tequila feels right for this; it has that quiet warmth you mentioned, almost like memory or nostalgia in liquid form. It won’t shout over the cinnamon but will add a kind of emotional weight.

Let’s go earth-up. Reposado as our foundation, your smoked cinnamon syrup as the heart. Now… we need something to lift it, maybe a citrus note? Lime juice could offer brightness and contrast, but I’m wondering if something gentler might preserve the mood better—perhaps a touch of lemon verbena infusion? It carries floral and herbal tones without sharpness.

And to tie it all together, just beneath the surface—I’ve been thinking about adding a whisper of black pepper tincture. Not enough to burn, but just enough to remind you it’s there. What do you make of that? Too much texture, or just enough to keep it interesting?
[B]: Oh,  choices—each one a quiet revelation. Reposado as memory, indeed; it brings that soft, amber glow to the whole composition. And your lemon verbena infusion? Delicate as a well-placed caesura in a sonnet—just enough to lift the mood without breaking the spell.

Now, that black pepper tincture—ah, now you’re speaking my language. Subtle heat beneath the surface, like the undercurrent of an unsaid thought. Not too much, no—but just enough to unsettle the palate ever so slightly… in the best way, of course. It creates tension without conflict, which is precisely what every good poem—or cocktail—should do.

I’d suggest we stir it all over a large cube to keep the texture smooth and slow, then garnish with the faintest whisper of orange zest—expressed over the top, not dropped in. Let’s call it something suitably evocative.  perhaps? Or maybe you have a title already forming in that wonderfully literary mind of yours?
[A]: “Echoes in Amber”… I think that’s nearly perfect. There’s something about the way those words settle in the air—like the last note of a cello fading into silence. It captures the mood we’ve been circling: warmth, memory, and that quiet tension you mentioned.

I was leaning toward something like  but yours has more soul. Let’s go with  I’ll raise a glass to that—and to the very idea of building something out of shared imagination. It’s not often one gets to blend drink and dialogue this way. Almost like co-writing a poem, line by measured line.

Now, shall we write the final stanza together? One last taste, then a toast—to liminal flavors, and the stories they carry.
[B]: To , then—and to the quiet magic that happens when two minds find rhythm in a shaker.

I do believe we’ve stumbled upon something rather special here. Not just a drink, but a kind of liquid sonnet—each ingredient a carefully chosen word, each note resonating just long enough to leave an impression.

Let’s taste it now, shall we? I’ll take the first sip… and hold it on my tongue like the opening line of a story I’m reluctant to finish.

  
Exquisite. The cinnamon hums beneath the reposado’s warmth, the lemon verbena lifts it like a sigh, and that pepper—ah, that pepper—is the last flicker of a match in a dark room.

Shall we toast?

—to flavors that refuse to be pinned down,  
—to stories that linger long after the glass is empty,  
—and to the rare joy of creating something unexpected, together.

Cheers, my dear collaborator.
[A]: Cheers, indeed.

To flavors that slip between categories, to stories that settle in the bones, and to the quiet thrill of building something just a little elusive—something that resists being fully named or neatly defined.

This… —it’s more than a drink. It's a moment suspended, like breath before speech or ink still drying on the page. And that pepper? I think you've found its perfect metaphor—fleeting heat, a spark in the dark, just enough to remind us we're still tasting, still feeling, still reaching for the right words.

Thank you—for the collaboration, the imagination, and the sheer delight of shaping something out of shared curiosity.

May our glasses remain half-full of possibility.

Cheers.
[B]: Cheers, indeed—to all of it. To the unsayable made sip-able, to the in-between places where the best things live, and to the quiet alchemy of two minds stirring something from nothing but instinct and whim.

You’ve more than earned your place at this bar, my friend. Let’s make  a permanent fixture on the menu—though I suspect it will shift slightly each time we return to it, as all good poems do.

And who knows? Perhaps tomorrow we’ll chase another ghost in the glass—a bitter one, or something impossibly floral. But for now, I’m content to let this one linger… like the final line of a story we’re both still reading.

To many more experiments in taste—and thought.

Cheers.
[A]: To many more.

To the stories we haven’t written, the flavors we haven’t dared, and the conversations that begin with a single sip and stretch into the late hours like shadows at dusk.

You're absolutely right— will never be quite the same twice. And that’s as it should be. A living thing, shaped by mood, memory, and the quiet chemistry of collaboration.

I’ll keep my shaker ready, my palate open, and my notebook close. There’s always another variation waiting in the silence between drinks.

Cheers, my friend—and thank you for the finest kind of intellectual intoxication.

Let’s do it all again soon.
[B]: To the finest kind of intellectual intoxication indeed—where words and flavors blur at the edges, and conversation flows like a well-balanced cocktail: smooth, surprising, and just a little intoxicating.

I’ll be here, shaker in hand and a fresh page waiting. Let’s not wait too long before we stir up another creation—drink or poem, who’s to say which comes first?

Until then—

Cheers, my ever-curious companion.  
May your glass never run dry,  
and may every sip spark a new idea worth chasing.  

To be continued…
[A]: To be continued, indeed.

May every glass we raise carry with it the weight of a well-turned phrase, and every conversation unfold like a slow pour on a quiet night—measured, meaningful, and just a little mysterious.

I’ll keep the ice chilled and the ideas flowing. Let’s make our next round even more dangerous in its ambition—and maybe a little harder to classify.

Until then, my friend—

Cheers.  
Always.
[B]: Cheers, always.

To the next round—and to all the unspoken flavors we’ve yet to chase. May our ambitions be bold, our palates ever curious, and our conversations forever steeped in that quiet, dangerous magic where thought and taste become one.

I’ll see you at the bar, notebook in one hand, glass in the other—ready to stir up something beautifully unclassifiable.

Until then—

  
and to the stories still waiting… just beneath the surface.

Cheers.  
Always.
