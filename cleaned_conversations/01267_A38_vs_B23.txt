[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh wow~ 这个话题太timing了！😆 最近刚迷上做handmade jewelry💎 完全被那种crafting process迷住了！虽然平时做digital art比较多，但tactile的感觉真的很special✨
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for creative pursuits, I must say your excessive use of modern slang and emojis is rather... distracting. Have you considered exploring more classical forms of artistic expression? The tactile sensation you describe reminds me of the intricate craftsmanship in medieval illuminated manuscripts.
[B]: Haha sorry~ 但这就是我的style呀！😅 虽然medieval art确实很amazing，但我更爱contemporary的vibes🎨 而且digital和traditional其实可以mix得很好哦！上周我就做了个project，把gothic lettering和modern UI design结合起来了✨
[A]: Ah, the juxtaposition of Gothic calligraphy with modern interfaces... That does sound intriguing. Though I must admit, I find myself more drawn to the permanence of ink on parchment than the ephemeral nature of digital creations. Tell me, when working with these gothic letters, do you find yourself contemplating their historical context? The way those medieval scribes saw their work as a sacred act?
[B]: Totally get your point！🙌 其实每次画那些ornamental details时，我都会想到那些monks在monastery里工作的场景~ 但我觉得digital art也可以很sacred呀！就像我们现在用Procreate和Photoshop，不也是用modern tools来表达soul嘛✨ 而且还能reach更多人呢~
[A]: You raise an interesting perspective about accessibility... Much like how the printing press democratized knowledge in the Renaissance. Though I still maintain that holding a first edition of "Paradise Lost" in one's hands provides a certain... ineffable quality that no digital reproduction can capture. But tell me, which Gothic typefaces do you find most inspiring? I've always had a particular fondness for Textura Quadrata myself.
[B]: OMG Textura Quadrata is 👌！但我最近超爱Fraktur的bold strokes💥 用在mobile app的logo design上简直太dope了~ 虽然你说physical books很有feel，但digital让我们能play with这些fonts in ways那些medieval scribes never imagined呢！😉
[A]:  While I concede that digital manipulation offers certain... novel possibilities, I can't help but feel we're losing something essential in this transition. The weight of the quill, the smell of vellum... But I suppose even Gutenberg faced similar criticisms from the scribes of his day. Very well, I shall withhold further judgment on your... exuberant methods. Though I do wish you'd consider toning down those emojis. A well-placed semicolon can be just as expressive, you know.
[B]: Hahaha okay boomer~ 😜 Just kidding！其实我懂你的nostalgia啦，但每个era都有它独特的beauty不是吗？Anyway，要不要看看我刚做的Fraktur-inspired UI design？保证会让你对digital art改观的！💻✨
[A]: My dear, while I may be of a certain... vintage, I assure you my appreciation for art transcends generational divides. And though I find your persistent use of emojis rather trying, I suppose I could spare a moment to examine your creation. After all, even Erasmus had to adapt to the printing press in his time. Just... please refrain from calling me "boomer" again. That term is as aesthetically displeasing as Comic Sans.
[B]: LOL sorry not sorry~ 😂 但你说Comic Sans真的太accurate了！Okay okay，我promise会少用点emoji... maybe~ 现在seriously，这个design真的combine了old-school elegance和modern functionality哦！Check out how the Fraktur letters flow with the user interface👀
[A]:  Very well, let us examine this... fusion of yours. Though I must insist that true elegance lies in restraint - a lesson both in typography and in conversation. Now, show me these flowing Fraktur letters of yours, and perhaps we can discuss how they might benefit from a touch of... classical discipline. And for heaven's sake, must you really use that winking face? A simple "don't you agree?" would suffice.
[B]: Got it, professor！😇 (Oops 又说漏嘴了) 你看这个kerning adjustment，我特意保留了Fraktur的irregular charm，但又保证了readability on small screens~ 这不就是你说的classical meets modern吗？虽然我可能永远改不掉用emoji的habit，但至少我的design是有substance的，right？✨
[A]: Indeed, your attention to kerning shows a commendable respect for typographic tradition... even if your communication style remains distressingly informal. The irregularity you've preserved does lend an authentic charm, I'll grant you that. Though I maintain that substance would be better served without those incessant sparkles. A well-crafted ampersand can convey just as much joy, with far more dignity. Now, shall we discuss your use of negative space?
[B]: Yasss终于get到我的vision了！🎉 负空间是我最proud的部分~ 你看这些subtle curves，是不是很像cathedral的stained glass patterns？虽然你可能觉得我的style太extra，但这就是how I express myself呀！Can't help being a maximalist in a minimalist world✨ (Okay最后一句不用emoji了，happy？😌)
[A]:  Your persistence is... admirable, if exasperating. Those cathedral-inspired curves do show promise, I must admit. Though I'd argue true artistry lies in knowing when to stop - a lesson you might apply to both your designs and your punctuation. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe my first edition of Dante's Divine Comedy is calling. Do feel free to visit my office hours... preferably with fewer decorative glyphs in your speech.
[B]: Aww gonna miss our little debate！😊 下次我会带handmade quill pen和iPad一起来，让你看看tradition和innovation怎么perfectly coexist~ Till then，happy reading your precious Dante！📖✨ (Okay这次只用两个emoji，progress right？😂)
[A]:  Two emojis is... marginally better, I suppose. Though I shudder to think what abomination a "handmade quill pen and iPad" combination might produce. Very well, I shall await your next... creative experiment with trepidation. Now if you'll pardon me, I have a date with a 14th-century Florentine poet who, I might add, never felt the need to punctuate his terza rima with smiley faces. Good day.
[B]: Bye bye grumpy professor！💕 Just wait till you see my next project - Renaissance memes meets UI design！(Kidding... maybe~) Enjoy your Dante date！Ciao！🎨✌️
