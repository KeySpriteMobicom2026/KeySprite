[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得3D printing会改变制造业吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 3D printing确实是个disruptive technology，特别是在prototyping和customized production方面。不过从investment角度看，目前ROI还不太理想。
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for modern technology, I must confess my mind tends to wander toward more poetic considerations. Have you ever noticed how the layered construction in 3D printing mirrors the careful craftsmanship of Victorian poetry? Each line building upon the last, much like the additive manufacturing process...
[B]:  哈哈，这个比喻很有意思。不过从financial perspective来看，3D printing更像是个scalability play。就像我们做LBO时讲究的operational efficiency，现在layer by layer的manufacturing process确实能reduce inventory cost~ 😊
[A]: Ah, you speak with such passion about these mechanical matters. But tell me, doesn't this talk of efficiency remind you of Ezra Pound's famous dictum - "Make it new"? Though I suspect he wasn't referring to supply chain optimization...  The true artistry lies not in the speed of production, but in the beauty of creation.
[B]:  Well, beauty is in the eye of the shareholder~ 说到creation，我们最近在看一个additive manufacturing的startup，他们的cash burn rate控制得相当好。不过你提到的artistry...让我想起Warren Buffett说过，投资既是science也是art。Cheers! 🍷
[A]: How delightfully you weave together commerce and culture! Though I must say, your Mr. Buffett sounds rather like Matthew Arnold discussing the intersection of poetry and criticism. But tell me, when you examine these balance sheets, do you ever find yourself longing for the lyrical cadence of a well-turned balance? Like the measured meter in Tennyson's works...
[B]:  哈哈，financial statements的'poetry'在于那些hidden value啊。就像我们最近exit的一个portfolio company，EBITDA multiple从5x涨到12x，这才是真正的sonnet of success~ 不过说到Tennyson...我更喜欢用他的'knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers'来形容due diligence的重要性。
[A]: What a charming blend of pragmatism and romanticism you display! Though I must gently point out that your numerical sonnets lack the emotional resonance of, say, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "How Do I Love Thee? Let me count the ways..." But I suppose in your world, the counting refers rather to profit margins than to poetic meter? 
[B]:  在PE行业，love is measured in IRR和cash-on-cash return啊~ 不过你说得对，有时候deal making确实需要一点poetic license。就像我们negotiate term sheet时，既要精确到每一个basis point，又要保持一定的flexibility。Cheers to that! 🥂
[A]: How amusing to hear you speak of poetic license in the context of financial instruments! Though I must say, your version of poetry seems rather more concerned with decimal points than with the sublime. Still, there's a certain rhythm to your spreadsheets that almost - almost - reminds me of the measured cadence of Gerard Manley Hopkins... if one squints just right.
[B]:  Hopkins的'sprung rhythm'？那让我想起我们最近一个deal的volatile cash flow pattern~ 不过在LBO模型里，我们更关心的是debt paydown schedule和equity IRR。说到这个...你知道Warren Buffett把compound interest称为世界第八大奇迹吗？这才是真正的financial poetry! 😄
[A]: My goodness, you do have a way of turning every beautiful metaphor into a financial ratio! Though I suppose compound interest does have its own sort of relentless momentum, rather like Thomas Hardy's fatalistic verse... But tell me, does your spreadsheet poetry ever pause to consider the human element behind those numbers? Or is all reduced to cold calculations?
[B]:  这就是为什么我们做investment committee时总会留出20% weighting给management team assessment。Numbers don't lie, but people make the difference - 就像我们portfolio里那家turnaround成功的manufacturer，全靠CEO的vision和execution。Human capital才是ultimate value driver啊~
[A]: Ah! At last we find common ground between our worlds. That CEO's vision you speak of - why, it's not unlike the creative vision of a poet shaping raw words into art. Though I daresay your preferred medium is Excel rather than parchment... Still, I'm heartened to hear you acknowledge that behind every successful column of numbers, there beats a human heart. How very... Wordsworthian of you.
[B]:  说到Wordsworth，他那个'spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings'的theory，跟我们做growth equity investment时的thesis很像啊 - 要找到那些真正有product-market fit的businesses。不过说真的，在private equity行业，比起poetry，我更相信data-driven decision making。No offense~ 😉
[A]: None taken, dear number-cruncher. Though I can't help but wonder if your beloved data points might benefit from occasional communion with Keats' "negative capability" - that willingness to embrace uncertainty which, I suspect, even your most sophisticated models cannot quantify. But there, I'm being fanciful again... Do carry on with your spreadsheets.
[B]:  说到uncertainty...我们risk management team刚更新了Monte Carlo simulation model。不过你说得对，有时候markets就像Romantic poetry一样unpredictable。我得去参加个board meeting了，下次golf game再继续这个fascinating conversation？ 🏌️♂️
[A]: How perfectly you've scheduled our parting! Though I must say, your golf game likely moves with more predictable regularity than Byron's stanzas. Until then, may your simulations be favorable and your spreadsheets... well, perhaps not quite as lyrical as Shelley, but serviceable enough. Good day!
[B]:  Touché! 不过记住，在investment world里，predictability比poetic license更值钱。See you on the green - 希望你的short game跟你的metaphors一样sharp! ⛳
