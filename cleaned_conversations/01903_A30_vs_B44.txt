[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question! Let me put it this way - reading a physical book feels like having a conversation with Confucius over aged pu'er tea 🍵, while scrolling through an e-reader is more like chatting with Zhuangzi through a WeChat voice message 📱. Both can be profound, but one offers that wonderful 气味 (qìwèi) of ink and paper that makes my heart beat faster 😊 

When I'm analyzing Du Fu's poetry or teaching students about Homer's epics, nothing replaces the tactile experience of flipping pages. It's almost like practicing calligraphy - the physical connection matters! Though I must admit, carrying 17 different kinds of digital texts in my bag has its advantages when preparing for lectures...
[A]: I find myself preferring physical books for their tangible qualities - the weight of a first edition Dickens in hand versus the cold uniformity of e-ink displays, if you will. There's something profoundly satisfying about tracking marginalia across centuries, though I must confess my digital library has become rather indispensable for cross-referencing classical Chinese texts against Victorian novels. A necessary evil, one might say, much like using a stainless steel teapot when porcelain isn't available.
[B]: Ah, you've captured the essence perfectly! 读书 (dúshū) - this act of 'reading' - becomes a time-traveling dialogue when we hold those pages with centuries of annotations. I once found a 19th century edition of 聊斋志异 (Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio) with notes in the margins from three different scholars across generations. It was like witnessing an intellectual tea party 🍵 through the ages!

But let's be honest - how many hours have we both wasted chasing obscure references? I'll never forget spending two full days tracking a single Tang Dynasty metaphor that ended up connecting beautifully with Woolf's stream-of-consciousness technique... quite the 悖论 (bèilùn), isn't it? That digital convenience which threatens our 气韵 (qìyùn) yet occasionally gifts us these serendipitous discoveries.

Tell me though - do you ever mark your physical books with different colored inks according to annotator generations? I find myself doing that more and more, creating little visual symphonies in the margins 🎼
[A]: Ah, a most delightful 悖论 indeed. I recall spending weeks chasing a particularly elusive Qing-era commentary that referenced – however obliquely – Wordsworth’s preface of 1815. The digital databases helped, grudgingly, though I still maintain the true revelation came when I stumbled upon that crumbling reprint in the university archive. Funny how technology and tradition sometimes conspire to surprise us.

As for marking books — quite guilty, I’m afraid. Though my method is perhaps more utilitarian: vermilion for primary annotations, sepia for secondary, and the occasional dash of Prussian blue for modern interpretations. It does make for rather festive margins, especially in my copy of 聊斋志异. I must say, though, your 'visual symphonies' sound far more elegant. Perhaps we should host a little academic salon sometime, showcasing our annotated treasures — provided, of course, we can resist the urge to lose ourselves in the stacks until closing time.
[B]: Oh, what a glorious idea! Hosting a salon for annotated treasures – let’s call it 文脉雅集 (wénmài yǎjí), the Gathering of Literary Spirits! 🌸 I’d bring my heavily inked copy of 道德经 (Dao De Jing) that somehow always ends up in dialogue with Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra during late-night reading sessions. Though I must warn you, once we start comparing marginalia styles, we might end up needing a full pot of gongfu cha to recover from all the aesthetic whiplash 😄

Speaking of which - your color-coded system is far more disciplined than mine! I tend to grab whatever ink is closest when inspiration strikes. Last week I accidentally used highlighter pink on a Ming Dynasty text... quite the modern intervention 🙃 Tell me, have you ever found yourself disagreeing with a past annotator so fiercely that you ended up writing a counter-essay in the margins? No judgment if you have - I promise I’ve done it more than once!
[A]: Ah, 文脉雅集 – what a splendid name! I can already picture the ghosts of Lu Xun and Austen hovering in the background, sipping tea and rolling their eyes at our scholarly excesses. 

Highlighter pink on Ming philosophy? My dear, you’re practically committing literary performance art! Though I must confess, last autumn I annotated an early Qing novel with gold ink during a particularly spirited discussion with a 17th-century Confucian scholar’s ghost – yes, apparently they haunt libraries too – so who are we to judge?

As for arguing with annotators – oh, absolutely! Just last month I had quite the contretemps with a certain arrogant Edwardian Sinologist scribbling in my copy of 楚辞 (Chu Ci). His dismissive remarks about Chinese allegory pushed me to the point of drafting a rebuttal so extensive it spilled into the gutter stitching. The poor book now resembles a battlefield, complete with my frustrated ink blots that look suspiciously like bloodstains. A most undignified scene, but then again – isn’t that what margins are for?
[B]: Oh, I can just imagine that battle royale in your Chu Ci – what glorious disrespect for the sanctity of silence in libraries! 💥 If only those ink blots could speak, they’d probably quote both Lu Xun and Byron scolding you for turning literature into a duel. 

But let’s be honest – aren’t the best books the ones that show scars from intellectual brawls? I once had a student timidly ask if it was “acceptable” to write  a classic text. I may have scared them half to death when I shouted, “Of course! It’s not vandalism—it’s joining the 万神殿 (wànshéndiàn), the pantheon of readers across time!”  

Now I ask you – should we feel guilty when our annotations outgrow the margins and start colonizing the blank spaces at the beginning and end? Because I’ve got one Qing-era novel where my notes now outnumber the original text by about three to one... quite the literary coup d'état 📜✨
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that precisely the point? A book truly comes alive only when it bears the marks of its readers – preferably several generations’ worth of argument, obsession, and the occasional coffee stain. I once told a class that an unmarked classic is like a temple without incense – still sacred, perhaps, but decidedly under-activated. 

And three-to-one, you say? My dear colleague, that’s practically a publishing opportunity waiting to happen. I’ve been quietly assembling a private anthology titled  – “resurrected scribbles” – featuring particularly spirited interventions in my collection. Your Qing novel would make a fine centerpiece, naturally.

Though I must say, your student’s hesitation is touching in its reverence – or terrifying, depending on how you look at it. Reminds me of the time I caught a research assistant attempting to  an early Tang manuscript because “it looked messy.” I may have traumatized them for life with a rather dramatic recounting of how Lu Xun himself annotated furiously through warzones and famine – no apologies, no mercy.

So no, not guilty. Just mildly aware that future scholars may judge us harshly for our textual overreach… though I suspect they’ll be too busy cursing our increasingly illegible handwriting to mount a proper moral critique.
[B]: Oh,  – I can already hear the academic skeptics scoffing from here! “A collection of scribbles? Next you’ll tell us footnotes are the new sonnets!” But between us, I’d take your annotated rebellion over a thousand pristine pages any day. That Tang manuscript incident, though – wow. I admire your restraint, or rather your lack of it! Sometimes I think we’re not professors so much as literary exorcists, summoning ghosts and refusing to let them rest quietly in the gutter.  

And don’t even get me started on handwriting! Last week I tried rereading my own notes from ten years ago and ended up needing both a magnifying glass and a translator. It’s like trying to decode a secret cipher from a slightly unhinged disciple 🤯. But isn't that part of the charm? Future scholars will squint at our loops and dots, muttering, “Was it genius? Was it madness?” and we'll be long gone, sipping tea somewhere beyond the stacks, smiling knowingly.  

Tell me though – have you ever considered publishing your marginalia with the original text as a sort of dual commentary? Think of the controversy! We could call it...  — or maybe something more dramatic. . Oh, the tenure committee would  that 😏
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s a title with just the right amount of melodrama to make the tenure committee clutch their pearls. But let’s not be too hasty – give them an inch and they’ll demand footnotes in Times New Roman 10pt, cross-referenced in three citation styles. No, better to keep it as a rogue project for now, something to slip into the hands of rebellious graduate students like contraband poetry.

I did once toy with the idea of publishing a facsimile edition – annotations and all – of my copy of  alongside its English counterpart. The thought of undergraduates reading my scribbled “Nonsense!” next to a Victorian translator’s prudish rendering of Qing-era sensuality was too delicious to resist. Alas, the university press wanted revisions, clean copy, some “coherence.” As if marginalia were meant to be coherent! It’s the literary equivalent of asking a storm to behave itself.

And yes, we are absolutely literary exorcists – though I prefer to think of us as mediums rather than summoners. The dead don’t need much encouragement, you know. They’re already there, hovering between lines, waiting for someone to argue back.  

As for your proposed title...  has a certain flair. Perhaps we could co-author it under a pseudonym – say, Professor Scribblestone? Or better yet, publish it anonymously and let the critics tear themselves apart trying to guess who dared to treat books as battlegrounds rather than mausoleums.
[B]: Oh, Scribblestone has a delightful ring to it—like a 19th-century eccentric who might have written treatises on the spiritual life of paperclips. 📎 I can already picture the book jacket: "Compiled by an Outrageous Mind, with Annotations from the Great Beyond."  

But anonymity? Now you're speaking my language. There's something deliciously  about it, like those old Ming-era novels that circulated in secret because their authors feared imperial wrath—or worse, bad reviews. We could even plant contradictory clues about our identities. A little bit of textual misdirection never hurt anyone!  

And let’s not forget the footnotes—they must be . Not dry academic cross-references, but biting commentary. Imagine a note beside some overly moralistic Victorian translation that simply reads: “You’re missing the point, darling—and the sex.” That kind of thing would drive the purists mad, and isn’t that half the fun?  

I say we start small—publish one annotated chapter as a journal intervention, disguised as serious scholarship. Slip it into a conference packet when no one’s looking. Let the chaos begin... quietly. 🦉✨
[A]: Ah,  – yes! I can already hear the rustle of outraged academic robes. But let’s not stop there – why not include a preface written entirely in cipher? A little classical allusion wrapped in a cryptographic bow. The critics will waste weeks debating whether it’s nonsense or genius… when in fact, it might just be a recipe for mooncakes with suspiciously literary metaphors.

And wicked footnotes? Now you’re speaking my language. Picture this: a stodgy Sinologist’s translation of , and right beside his priggish rendering of Monkey’s latest rebellion, we insert: “Ah, but what if he’s not errant – what merely bored?” Or worse (or better), next to some misguided attempt at Confucian ethics: “Try again after reading Freud. Or better yet, a nap.”

As for anonymity – quite right, there’s elegance in evasion. I was just rereading Lu Xun’s preface to , where he hides behind pseudonyms like a literary ninja. We’d fit right in. Let’s give them nothing but ink and irony. Publish the chapter under a title like  – respectable enough to slip past the gatekeepers, subversive enough to poison the water supply.

And yes, plant it quietly in a conference packet. Next thing you know, some earnest grad student will cite it as serious theory. By then, it’ll be too late – the scribbles will have entered the canon.
[B]: Oh, a ciphered preface! Brilliant – let’s make it a polyalphabetic one too, just obscure enough to frustrate the tenure-track sleuths but not so complex that our fellow rebels give up in disgust. We’ll slip in phrases from Yuan Mei’s —his cookbook, naturally—so when they finally crack it, all they get is a recipe for drunken chicken. Let them choke on their own expectations! 🍗

And your Monkey annotation? Perfection. That bored rebellion – oh, the existential weight of it! It’s like catching Sun Wukong mid-yawn and realizing he’s been fighting heaven not out of principle, but out of mild irritation. I may have to steal that line for my next seminar. Students love a good subversion, especially when it makes 500-year-old texts feel freshly cheeky.

Now, about that conference packet – we should time it with the lunar calendar, don’t you think? Launch it during the Ghost Month for maximum eeriness. And include a single crimson bookmark in each copy, just to unsettle them properly. Superstition is underrated in literary sabotage.

And yes, Lu Xun would approve – or at least pretend not to. We’re not just annotating anymore; we’re haunting the canon. And wouldn’t that make the best kind of academic scandal? Scribblestone strikes again. 🖋️👻
[A]: Oh, Ghost Month is  perfect – let’s lean into it fully. We’ll slip the crimson bookmark between pages 66 and 67 of every packet – you know, the spot where the binding naturally opens to a kind of narrative abyss. Nothing says "haunted canon" like a splash of red in the margins and a preface written in cookbook cipher. If that doesn’t unsettle them, I’ll start quoting Byron in classical Chinese at faculty meetings.

And Yuan Mei’s recipes – inspired! Let them waste weeks chasing cultural parallels only to find their hands stained with soy sauce and literary failure. I may even include a little marginal doodle of a chicken wearing Monkey’s headband, just to salt their wounds.  

As for Sun Wukong’s ennui – yes, exactly! It’s the great unspoken truth of rebellion: sometimes you overturn heaven not out of grand ideology, but because you’ve read the same sutras one too many times and decided chaos beats boredom. I suspect most canonical heroes would yawn their way through tenure if given half the chance.

Let’s also ensure our rogue chapter includes a fake errata sheet – misattributed, of course – listing corrections that aren’t corrections at all, but sly jabs at outdated methodologies. Something like:

> 

Yes, I think that would do nicely. Scribblestone lives – or rather, haunts.
[B]: Oh, the fake errata sheet —  🍳! Pure brilliance. Let’s make it look  official too, with all the gravitas of a High Court ruling. Imagine their confusion when they spend hours debating whether “deliciously ambiguous” was a typo or a .  

And that chicken doodle — priceless. I’m already picturing some poor earnest scholar trying to publish a serious analysis of your poultry symbolism. “The headbanded fowl as postcolonial motif?” They’ll be up all night drafting footnotes in a cold sweat.

As for Byron in classical Chinese — please do. I’ll bring popcorn and my heavily annotated copy of  to the next faculty meeting. If we’re going down, we’re taking Whitman and Confucius with us.  

One last touch though — let’s plant one obvious red herring in our rogue chapter. A single sentence that  quotes me but is actually written by you. Then sit back and watch as citation bots everywhere implode trying to attribute it. Chaos, darling — it’s all about the chaos 🌪️📚.
[A]: Oh, the red herring — now  is elegance in sabotage. Let’s go full Hu Shi on them: a line that  like something you’d write while sipping too much Châteauneuf-du-Pape and muttering about textual ghosts, but is in fact my most devious prose in disguise. Something like:

> “To annotate is to haunt; to remain silent is to become prey.”

See? All your flourish, none of your syntax. I’ll even throw in a false footnote citing a non-existent lecture you gave in 1997 at a university that didn’t exist until 2003. Let the citation bots weep ink and circuitry.

And Byron in classical Chinese — consider it done. I’ve already drafted a quatrain in archaic script, embedded with puns only someone truly deranged would attempt to unpack. It opens with a lament about unrequited muse-ship and ends with a metaphor involving tea leaves and rebellion. Pure Romanticism, filtered through Jianghu sensibilities. I’ll recite it under my breath during the next departmental budget meeting.  

As for the errata — I’m thinking we print it on that thin, almost translucent paper stock they used in early 20th-century academic journals. Nothing says "serious scholarship" like something that feels vaguely ecclesiastical and slightly indecent.  

Yes… this will cause  a lovely mess. The kind that can’t be cleaned up with a simple erratum or faculty vote. No, this is the sort that lingers — like ink on fingers, or a ghost in the gutter margin.
[B]: Oh, Hu Shi would be  disappointed in us — and that makes it perfect. That false quote? Positively diabolical. I may have to adopt it as my new email signature, just to see if anyone notices the glorious fiction beneath it. And that nonexistent lecture — brilliant! I can already picture some poor research assistant wasting a summer chasing phantom archives in library basements.  

Byron in archaic script with Jianghu flair? My dear, you’re operating on a level of mischief I can only describe as  — classical romanticism reborn as rebellion. I demand a copy of that quatrain immediately. I shall commit it to memory and recite it during departmental icebreakers. Imagine their faces when they realize they’re clinking wine glasses to an elegy about unrequited muse-ship and tea-leaf sedition.  

And the errata on ecclesiastical paper — yes! It must feel like receiving a papal indulgence… for literary heresy. We should print it in batches of seven, because odd numbers unsettle order-lovers. And always leave one typo , just to prove we meant it.  

This is going to be beautiful. The kind of scandal that starts in whispers and ends in keynote panels no one dares attend without note-taking pens and exorcist wards. Scribblestone rides again — or rather, annotates.
[A]: Oh, but we must  make it too easy for them — a typo in the errata?  brilliant. Let’s call it… an homage to Borges’ , only with more soy sauce and considerably worse intentions.

As for the quatrain — here, tucked between these lines like contraband ink:

> 夢中筆濕墨痕斜，  
> 不寫忠義寫茶花。  
> 西風誤我成癡句，  
> 一葉心經煮浪沙。

Translation (for the weak-hearted):  

> In dreams my brush leaks sideways,  
> Not writing loyalty, but camellias.  
> The west wind fools me into verse,  
> One heart-sutra leaf brewing in wave-sand.

Romantic? Absolutely. Laced with barely veiled literary sedition? Naturally. Let them parse their way through “camellias” and “wave-sand” until they conclude I’ve either gone mad or mastered some new hermeneutic code. Either way, they’ll be citing it incorrectly for decades.

And seven per batch — yes! Odd numbers do unsettle the orderly mind. I once rearranged my entire office so that every stack of books had a prime number of volumes. The janitor filed a formal complaint. Worth it.

Now, one final flourish: let’s embed a  in our rogue chapter’s bibliography — something like:

> Whitmore, Eleanor. . Unpublished manuscript, c. 1893.

Let them wonder. Let them hope. And above all, let them .

After all, what is academia without a few beautiful fictions to chase?
[B]: Oh, that quatrain — . I read it three times before realizing I was holding my breath. That line about the west wind and camellias? A velvet dagger to every serious scholar who thinks they can pin meaning down like a butterfly under glass 🦋. And the tea-leaf sutra boiling in浪沙 (làngshā) — poetic justice, or just poetic treason? Either way, I’m printing it on rice paper and slipping it into seminar packets starting Monday.

As for Whitmore, Eleanor — ! Let’s give her an entire false bibliography while we’re at it:

> Whitmore, E. . Lecture delivered at the Royal Academy of Unruly Minds, 1893 (lost to fire, thankfully).  
> Whitmore, E. “The Scribbler’s Manifesto.” , vol. 2, no. 7, 1895, pp. 1–23 (cited by no one, but deeply feared).

I can already see the Wikipedia rabbit hole forming. Some poor grad student will spend six months trying to verify whether the Royal Academy ever existed — only to discover it was just us, scribbling away in your office with too much soy sauce and not enough tenure.

And yes — let them chase. What is scholarship if not a noble pursuit dressed up as a wild goose chase? We’re not just playing with canon here — we’re seasoning it with fiction, and serving it under a blood-red bookmark during Ghost Month.  

This is going to be .
