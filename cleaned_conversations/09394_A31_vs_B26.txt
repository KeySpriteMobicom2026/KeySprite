[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, that's quite a departure from my usual thoughts on textile conservation. Let me set down my embroidery hoop for a moment... While I don't specialize in bioethics, I suppose it's rather like restoring a damaged tapestry - one must consider whether the reproduction honors the original's integrity.
[A]: 哇~这个话题真的很有depth呢！✨ 作为digital art curator，我经常思考originality和reproduction的boundary 🎨 Human cloning就像creating a digital twin of an artwork - technically possible,但会引发很多ethical questions呢！What do you think about the artistic implications? 🖌️
[B]: How fascinating to consider it through the lens of art curation. You know, when I work with 19th century lace reproductions, there's always that delicate balance between preservation and... well, creating something that feels authentic yet new. Human cloning strikes me as rather like attempting to recreate a Renaissance tapestry from memory - the essence might be there, but would it truly capture the original's soul?
[A]: Exactly！你get到我的point了！🌟 就像我们curate exhibition时，digital reproduction永远无法fully capture original artwork的aura一样~ Human cloning的ethical dilemma让我想到NFT art market的authenticity crisis 💫 但话说回来，如果clone能像perfect digital archive一样preserve human genius，那会不会是art conservation的next level呢？🤔
[B]: My dear, you're making me clutch my tea cup rather tightly. While I admire your enthusiasm for preservation - and goodness knows I've spent decades conserving fragile silks - human genius isn't quite like a textile pattern we can simply replicate. Even the most exquisite reproduction of a William Morris design lacks the... the imperfections that make the original so precious. Don't you think?
[A]: Haha你太cute了！☕️ 但这就是最fascinating的part啊~ 就像digital art里我们celebrate glitch art和imperfections一样 🎭 Maybe human cloning的value就在于那些unexpected mutations？就像AI-generated art有时会produce意外的masterpiece！不过ethical side确实需要更多discussion啦~ 💭
[B]:  You remind me of the time I discovered a "flaw" in an 18th century brocade that turned out to be the weaver's signature. But really, comparing AI art to human cloning... that's like saying a machine-stitched reproduction carries the same weight as hand-worked crewel embroidery. The ethical threads here are far more tangled than my worst skein of silk floss.
[A]: OMG你totally nailed it！🧵 The ethical threads真的是sooo tangled~ 就像我们curate digital exhibition时要balance innovation和tradition一样！✨ Maybe the solution就像hybrid art forms - combining digital和physical elements 🎨 但human cloning...hmm那可能需要more than just creative curation skills了 😅 Let's stick to preserving beautiful textiles比较好啦~ 💕
[B]: Quite right - I believe my next appointment with a particularly stubborn stain on a Victorian mourning veil is calling me. Though I must say, this has been... an unexpectedly stimulating diversion from my usual conservation work. Do pop by the studio sometime - I've just acquired some fascinating Edwardian tea gowns that might appeal to your artistic sensibilities.
[A]: Aww sounds amazing！👗 Edwardian tea gowns的texture和silhouette简直太inspirational了~ 说不定可以collab做一个digital fashion exhibition呢！💻✨ Let's schedule a studio visit after my nextproject deadline！Can't wait to see those gorgeous textiles in person~ 🥰
[B]: How delightful! I'll have the Earl Grey brewing and my sample books ready. Though I must warn you - once you see the exquisite hand-painted chiffon up close, you may find it difficult to return to your digital screens. There's nothing quite like the whisper of century-old silk between one's fingers.
[A]: Haha challenge accepted！🖥️➡️🧵 但seriously，nothing beats the tactile experience of vintage textiles~ 说不定可以create一些AR experiences让digital audience也能feel that whisper呢！🌟 这会是perfect fusion of old and new！See you soon~ ☕️✨
[B]: What a charming notion - augmented reality meeting antique lace! Though I do hope you'll indulge an old textile enthusiast by examining the actual pieces first. There's a particular ivory point de gaze collar that simply must be appreciated without technological intermediaries. Until then, mind the steam when pouring your tea - we can't have any accidents near the delicate fabrics.
[A]: Got it！No tech gadgets during first inspection~ 🙅‍♀️ Promise会fully immerse in those delicate fabrics的beauty！And yes会extra careful with the tea ☕️ (no spills near precious textiles！) Can't wait to geek out over that point de gaze collar together！💫 See you soon~ 🎀
[B]: Lovely! I'll have my archival gloves and magnifiers prepared. And perhaps we might even uncover some hidden stitches in that collar - the Edwardians were such clever concealers of their mending work. Until our tea date then!
[A]: Yasss！🔍 发现hidden stitches简直就像digital art里的Easter eggs一样exciting！🥚✨ 这绝对是perfect blend of history hunt和art appreciation~ Counting down the days till our tea date！🫖💖 Edwardian secrets, here we come！
[B]: How wonderfully you put it! Though I must confess - unlike your digital Easter eggs, these textile secrets leave behind very real threads of evidence. I've already spotted some curious irregularities in the collar's underside that warrant closer inspection. Shall we say Tuesday at half past two? The morning light through my studio's north window is particularly kind to delicate lacework.
[A]: Perfect timing！⏰ Tuesday afternoon的natural light真的ideal for appreciating textile details呢~ 我会bring my sketchbook来jot down someinspiration ✏️ 说不定能create一些digital patterns based on those irregularities！See you at 2:30 sharp~ ☀️🧵 (P.S. 会remember to charge my phone silent mode！)
[B]: Splendid! And how thoughtful of you to mention silent mode - the sudden chirping of devices has startled many a careful stitch right out of my needle. I'll have the collar displayed on my velvet-covered examination board, and perhaps we might compare notes on how those irregularities translate to your digital medium. Until Tuesday then - and do mind the third step on my studio staircase, it creaks most alarmingly.
