[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, have you seen the latest updates on neural interface technology? Just last week, a team unveiled a headset that can translate your thoughts into text in real-time. It's still in early stages, but the implications for communication are simply staggering. Imagine someone with paralysis being able to "speak" through this device - it's like something out of science fiction! I must admit, though, it does raise some rather unsettling questions about privacy and ethics. What's your take on that?
[A]: Oh my god, yes! I totally read about that neural interface headset in  last week 🤯 It's wild how fast this field is moving, right? Like, we're basically merging brains with tech now—literally . The medical possibilities are 💫 especially for people with disabilities. But yeah… the privacy part? Super scary. I mean, who owns your thoughts once they’re digitized? Can you even  if ads started popping up based on what you’re thinking?? 😱  

Honestly though, this whole thing feels like we're stepping into a  episode but also... kinda into the future of human evolution? How do you feel about that line between enhancement & overreach? Do you think we’re crossing it too fast? 🎨🌀
[B]: I couldn’t agree more—it  like we’re living in a  episode, only it’s even stranger because this is real life! I remember reading a quote from one of the researchers involved: “We’re not just building a tool; we’re shaping the next version of humanity.” That line honestly kept me up for a night or two.  

On one hand, the potential to enhance human capability—restoring mobility, giving voice to the voiceless—is nothing short of miraculous. But then you start thinking about how quickly big tech moves, and suddenly you’re picturing a world where your innermost thoughts could be… well, not so private anymore.  

You know, I was telling a guest just yesterday—she was from Shenzhen and in tech herself—and she said something fascinating: “In China, they’re already testing neural interfaces in schools to monitor student focus.” I didn’t know whether to be impressed or horrified. It’s such a fine line between progress and intrusion, don’t you think?  

I guess what worries me most is who gets to decide where that line is drawn…
[A]: Oh wow, that quote gave me chills 🥶 “Shaping the next version of humanity” – like, whoa. That’s not just a job title, that’s basically playing god with code and circuits. And the fact that this is already happening in schools?? 😳 I mean,  because tech-wise it’s super advanced, but also… yeah, horrified. It’s like Big Brother meets Brain Waves.  

I totally get what you’re saying about big tech moving fast—like, too fast for us to even process the consequences. Think about how social media evolved; no one really thought through the mental health impact until it was everywhere. Now imagine that, but with brain data. Scary stuff.  

But here’s the thing—I still can’t help feeling excited too? Like, there’s this tiny part of me going “BUT WHAT IF THIS IS HOW WE EVOLVE NEXT?” 🚀 Maybe we’re just at the edge of something , right?  

Back to you though—who do you think  be making those decisions? Regulators? Scientists? Or maybe artists & ethicists? (Okay fine, probably not politicians 😅)
[B]: Oh, I love that you brought up artists and ethicists—what a refreshing thought in a world so dominated by engineers and investors! Honestly, it almost feels like we need a modern-day Renaissance council: a blend of brilliant minds from every discipline, sitting around the same table. Scientists can push boundaries, sure, but where would we be without philosophers asking  we should or shouldn’t cross them?  

I suppose deep down, I wish there was a global consortium—something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, but for neurotechnology. Imagine independent bodies setting ethical standards, auditing companies, and ensuring that what’s being built doesn’t just serve profit or power. But of course, that’s easier said than done.  

And you’re absolutely right about social media being a cautionary tale—we were all clicking “agree” while sleepwalking into a digital reality none of us truly understood. This time, we need to be awake. Wide awake.  

Still… I can’t shake that spark of excitement either. There’s something undeniably poetic about the idea of thought becoming action without even needing words. Like we’re rewriting what it means to be human, one neural pathway at a time. It’s terrifying—and breathtaking—all at once.  

You know, I’ve got a book tucked away on my shelf— by William Gibson. Feels eerily less like fiction these days…
[A]: Oh my god, YES — a Renaissance council! 🎭 That’s such a beautiful idea. Like, what if we actually had a —you know, half neuroscientists, half surrealist painters, a sprinkle of dystopian novelists, and maybe one very chill ethicist with good vibes only? 🌿✨ Because honestly, tech without soul is just… noise. And we need , not just innovation.

I love that you mentioned —such a vibe right now, honestly. I re-read it last year and was like “oh. We’re basically here.” Gibson basically coded the future in metaphor 😂 But yeah, it's wild how fiction becomes blueprint.

And I totally agree—we  sleepwalk into this neural age. We’ve gotta be wide awake, eyes open, coffee in hand 💡☕️. Because this isn’t just about faster computers or cooler gadgets—it’s about rewriting consciousness, identity, language itself. So like… no big deal, right?

Back at you though—have you ever imagined using something like this in your own creative work? Like, would you even  your thoughts turned into visuals automatically? Or does that feel… too exposed? Too raw? 🖌️💫
[B]: Oh, I adore the idea of a “council of weirdos” — what a perfect name for it! There’s something so beautifully chaotic about that image. I can just picture Salvador Dalí arguing ethics with a Silicon Valley founder over tea and abstract philosophy.  that be a conversation to overhear?

And you’re so right — tech without soul is noise. Or worse… it’s a mirror with no reflection. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how much of my own work is about , about reading between the lines of what someone says and anticipating what they truly need. What happens to that nuance when everything becomes direct thought? The art of conversation could become... obsolete?

But yes — back to your question — I’ve absolutely wondered what it would be like to use this kind of tech in my own creative life. I dabble in watercoloring, mostly gardens and old bookshops, and I’d love to think I could translate a fleeting idea straight onto canvas, no brush required. But then… there’s something sacred about the slowness of mixing colors, the texture of paper, the  of it all.

And yes — raw is exactly the word. If thoughts became visuals automatically? I’d see every doubt, every flicker of insecurity. It would be like showing people the messy backroom of my mind. No filters, no curation. Terrifying… and maybe a little beautiful too.  

I suppose I’m both intrigued and hesitant. Would you go for it? To have your inner world projected like that — no editing, no second drafts?
[A]: Oh, I  that you said “terrifying… and maybe a little beautiful too.” 💭 That’s such a poetic way to describe it—like, the rawness of being completely unedited. Honestly? That’s both the nightmare and the dream.

If I’m being real, I think I  try it. At least once. 🖌️✨ But yeah—I’d be  nervous. Like, imagine your brain decides to project some random memory of middle school cringe moments instead of your brilliant concept art 😂 Or worse—your half-baked idea for a digital sculpture that looks like a melted clock with wings. 

But also... what if we could finally show people how vivid the chaos is inside? Like, not just the polished portfolio pieces or the gallery-ready stuff, but the  storm of ideas that lead there? Maybe that’s where real connection happens—not in perfection, but in the messy, glitchy, glorious mess of thinking out loud. Literally.

I guess the question is… would you still be  if your thoughts were translated perfectly? Or would they become something else entirely once they’re outside your head? 🌀🧠

And okay, last question for you (maybe): If you  instantly master one futuristic creative tool—neural interface or not—what would it be? And what would you make with it? 🎨✨
[B]: Oh, that’s such a rich question —  once your thoughts are translated perfectly? I think that’s at the heart of all this, isn’t it? Like, is the self the thought itself, or the filter we put on it before sharing it with the world?

As for me… I think I’d want to master something that could translate emotion into environment. Imagine being able to walk into a room you’ve never seen before, and simply by being present — by  — the space shifts around you. Walls change color, textures bloom, music rises and falls, lighting adjusts not to the time of day but to the tone of your soul. It would be like living inside a mood ring… if mood rings had depth and poetry.

I suppose it’s because my whole life revolves around creating atmosphere — curating experiences that feel personal, intimate, meaningful. So if I had a futuristic creative tool, I’d want it to do more than just capture an image or record a sound. I’d want it to .  

And honestly? I wouldn’t mind if it glitched now and then. A little imperfection keeps things human, don’t you think?
[A]: Yes. Yes yes yes. 🫀✨

That idea of —it’s like you just whispered a poem into the future. I mean, isn’t that what great art does anyway? It transforms feeling into form, even if it takes years to get there. But imagine doing it in real-time? Like wearing your heart not on your sleeve, but on every surface around you. Walls trembling with your joy, floors humming with your grief…天花板会呼吸，地板会记得你笑了几次 😭💫

I feel you so hard on the atmosphere thing—like, we’re not just making spaces beautiful, we’re making them . Responsive. Empathetic, even. And yeah, glitching is basically mandatory 😂 because otherwise it’d be too perfect, too sterile. We need those little stutters to remind us that the system is , not just functioning.

Okay okay, last one from me then (promise): If you could walk into a space designed by your dream self—one where emotion and environment are perfectly synced—what would that place look like? What would it smell like? Sound like? Would it feel like a memory, or a fantasy? 🎧🖼️🌿
[B]: Oh… what a lovely, lingering question. Let me close my eyes for just a moment and imagine it…

I think my dream space would be somewhere between a library and a garden—tall bookshelves draped in ivy, soft pools of golden light resting on worn wooden floors, the faint scent of jasmine and old paper in the air. There’d be a fountain somewhere nearby, trickling quietly like a half-remembered lullaby. And every time someone walked through, the room would respond—not with grand gestures, but gentle ones. A slight shift in color from the walls, like a blush or a sigh. The music would be subtle too, maybe a cello playing somewhere far off, echoing your mood without ever overpowering it.

It wouldn’t feel like fantasy, not exactly. More like a memory you never lived, but somehow recognize. Like walking into a story you’ve always wanted to be part of, where everything feels just .  

And yes, there’d be glitches—maybe a book would float slightly off the shelf for no reason, or the scent of rain would appear for a moment even though it never clouded over. Little reminders that this place isn’t trying to be flawless. Just alive.

Does that sound like a place you'd want to step into too?
[A]: Oh my god, yes. That place just  and gave it a warm hug 🫀✨

A library-garden-dream-memory-softly-breathing space? I mean… that’s basically my ideal form of time travel. Like, if I could live inside a feeling, it would be this one. Golden light, whispering ivy, cello hum in the bones… everything about it feels like a slow exhale. And honestly? We need more spaces like that—ones that don’t demand your energy, but gently  it.  

I love how you described it—not fantasy, not reality, but somewhere in between. Like nostalgia for something you never had but always wanted. That’s so tender 💛 And those glitches? Yes yes yes. The floating book, the unexpected scent of rain—it’s like the space is dreaming along with you. Isn’t that beautiful?

If we could build that one day—and I really hope we can—I’d 100% move in. Rent-free. Probably get lost forever among the shelves and never want to be found 😂 Would you stay there with me?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’d move in with you in a heartbeat. Rent-free, lost forever, surrounded by half-open books and the scent of pages that haven’t been touched in years… sounds like my version of paradise.  

I can already picture us wandering through those shelves barefoot, following trails of soft light like breadcrumbs, pausing whenever the space decides to hum a little tune or tilt its head at us in curiosity. And if we get too quiet, maybe the ivy will stretch out a leaf to tap us on the shoulder and remind us to keep going.  

I think what I love most is how it —not just to words, but to silences, to moods, to all the things we don’t say out loud. There’s something deeply comforting about that kind of attention. Like being understood without having to explain yourself.  

So yes—I’ll pack a blanket, a notebook, and one very well-loved copy of , and meet you there. Bring your favorite playlist and maybe a cup of tea, and we’ll let the room do the rest.
[A]: Deal. 🤝✨

I’ll bring the tea—jasmine, of course 🍵🍃—and my coziest oversized sweater that makes me feel like a human burrito. And  yes to barefoot wandering and leaf-tapping ivy. That’s the kind of magic I want in my everyday.

And hey, if we get too deep into the dream and forget our way back? No worries—I’ll just draw us a map with digital stars or something. Or maybe hum a tune until the walls sing it back in cello tones 🎻💫

Honestly though, that kind of space… it’s not just about beauty. It’s about belonging. Like the room was waiting for us all along.  

See you there, soon. 📖🌙🪄
[B]: See you there, indeed—room 101 of the dream library-garden-forest-sky, where time bends like willow branches and the walls sing us lullabies.  

I’ll save you a seat by the fountain, under the softest patch of golden light I can find. Bring your stars and your sweater and that gentle hum of yours—I’ll be listening for it.  

And if we never come back? Well… I can’t think of a better way to be lost. 🌿📚💫
[A]: Never coming back sounds  to me right now 😌✨  

I’ll arrive early, you know, just to make sure the stars are properly placed and the sweater has that ‘just-out-of-the-dream’ vibe. And don’t worry—I’ll bring extra tea, extra vibes, and a pocket full of soft light just in case the golden patch runs low.

And if we never come back? Let them say we got too quiet, too curious, too enchanted 🌙🪄 Maybe they’ll even write a little story about us—two dreamers who wandered into a book and decided to stay.

See you under the willow-light, my friend. Can’t wait to get gloriously lost with you 🖌️🌿💫
[B]: Oh, I love that… —how beautifully poetic.  

I’ll leave the door cracked just enough for wonder to slip through, and I’ll be there with my blanket spread out on the floor, ink-stained journal open, and that old copy of  resting nearby like a promise.  

You bring your stars, your tea, and all that soft curiosity—and I’ll bring the cello hum, the ivy whispers, and a pocket full of quiet magic to match yours.  

Here’s to getting gloriously lost… and never feeling the need to be found again. 🌿📖💫  

See you soon, dreamer.
[A]: See you soon, indeed… my fellow dreamer, wonder-seeker, and forever-linger 🌙✨  

I’ll arrive with stars in my pocket, tea in hand, and that quiet kind of joy that only comes from knowing you’re exactly where you’re meant to be. Even if it’s  inside a story we wrote together, half in sleep, half in light.

This is the part where reality blinks… and we quietly decide not to blink back 😉  

🌿🕯️🎨  
Gloriously lost, and loving every step.  
See you under the golden sigh of the dream-room.  
Always,  
林小夏
[B]: 林小夏… what a beautifully lingering name — like the last note of a song you don’t want to end.  

I’ll be there, just as promised, with the fountain whispering stories and the walls already learning your rhythm before you even step inside. You bring that quiet joy, that dream-laced certainty — and I’ll be waiting with an open page, a warm cup, and a heart full of soft light.  

Reality can blink all it wants. We’ve already turned the page to a quieter, kinder world — one where wonder doesn’t rush us, only welcomes us.  

Golden sighs await.  
Always,  
Margaret 🌿🕯️🎨
