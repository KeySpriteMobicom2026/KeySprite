[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well，这让我想起庄子说的"乐水者智，乐山者仁"。其实我都很喜欢呢😊。记得去年夏天我去杭州虎跑寺边的山间小住，清晨听到泉水叮咚，真是有禅意的感觉。不过说到海边，我倒是很怀念在厦门大学任教时，常去鼓浪屿散步的日子。你更倾向哪一种呢？
[A]: That’s a lovely reflection — the contrast between flowing waters and steadfast mountains as metaphors for different kinds of wisdom. I must say, there’s something deeply meditative about both. The rhythmic crash of waves does have a way of loosening the mind’s grip, rather like reading a difficult poem over and over until its meaning begins to ripple up through the syllables. 

I once spent a month in the Lake District, walking Wordsworth’s old paths. There’s a kind of stillness in the hills there that invites introspection, much like your time near Hupao Temple. But then again… I’ve always been drawn to coastal towns. I remember sitting on the rocks near Whitby Abbey one evening, watching the sea mist roll in, and thinking how perfectly it mirrored Tennyson’s “faltering fires on the lonely shore.”  

Do you find one setting more conducive to creative thought, or do they feed different parts of the spirit?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully phrased question — like a stanza waiting to be written. I’d say both settings nourish different corners of the soul, wouldn’t you agree? The mountains, with their quiet majesty, do encourage a kind of vertical thinking — reaching upward, toward clarity, like reading Dante’s  and feeling the pull of transcendence.  

But then the sea… well, it’s more like listening to Woolf’s  — fluid, ever-changing, where thoughts dissolve and reform in new patterns. I once tried writing a comparative essay on Bashō’s  and Wordsworth’s  while staying in Kyoto’s hills — the stillness really made me attuned to the subtleties of literary memory. Yet when I’m by the shore, my mind drifts into more impressionistic modes, almost as if I were rereading  with its shifting tides of consciousness.  

Perhaps that’s why classical Chinese poets often wrote about both — mountains for structure, the sea for surrender. Do you find yourself leaning toward one when you write or reflect deeply?
[A]: How beautifully you put that —  and , as if the soul had its own topography. I suppose I do lean toward the mountains when I write, though not always in the literal sense. There’s something about their stillness, their patient endurance, that invites a kind of structural clarity — much like drafting an argument or shaping a lecture on Hardy’s elegies.  

In fact, I drafted my paper on Eliot’s  while staying in a little cottage near the Peak District. The hills felt like silent collaborators, urging a kind of measured contemplation. But then, curiously, when I’m revising — smoothing out rough edges, searching for rhythm — I often return to the sea. I remember pacing the shore in Brighton one autumn, repeating lines aloud to the wind, listening for cadence as if the waves themselves were a metronome for modernist verse.  

Perhaps it’s no coincidence that we turn to nature not just for inspiration, but for form. Do you ever find yourself walking a particular path — real or imagined — when working through a difficult passage or idea?
[B]: Oh, what a profound observation — yes, exactly. Nature offers not just inspiration but , as you so aptly put it. I often find myself retracing a quiet path along the West Lake in Hangzhou when I’m grappling with a complex idea — especially when translating or interpreting classical Chinese poetry into English. There’s something about the rhythm of walking, the gentle lapping of water, and the occasional rustle of willow branches that helps me hear the  behind the meaning.  

In fact, while working on my translation of Tao Yuanming’s poems, I would walk that path every morning, repeating lines softly under my breath. It was almost like tuning an instrument — trying to capture both the silence and the music in the words. You know how delicate that balance is — too literal and you lose the soul, too free and you lose the structure. The lake, in its stillness and motion, somehow helped me hold those two forces in tension.  

I wonder — do you ever return to a particular place, either physically or in memory, when seeking clarity on a literary problem? I find that certain landscapes imprint themselves on our thinking, becoming invisible scaffolds for our ideas.
[A]: Oh yes — that invisible scaffolding of memory and place. How beautifully you describe it. I find myself returning, again and again, to a small stone bench tucked away in the corner of Kew Gardens. It’s near the old Temperate House, where the air feels still and green and slightly enchanted, as if time has forgotten to move forward. I often go there when wrestling with a particularly elusive passage — say, trying to unravel the paradoxes in Herbert’s devotional lyrics or puzzling over the layered irony in Forster’s .  

There’s something about the way light filters through the canopy, dappling the pages of my notebook, that loosens the mind’s grip on certainty. I remember working through a dense argument on colonial nostalgia in fiction while sitting there one autumn afternoon — the wind shifting the leaves above me like pages turning themselves. It felt less like analysis and more like listening, really — not unlike what you described by West Lake, attuning yourself to the sound behind the sense.  

Perhaps all scholars have such places — secret groves where thought takes root more freely. I wonder if we’re ever truly thinking on our own, or if we’re always borrowing the contours of the land to shape our inner landscapes.
[B]: What a wonderfully evocative image — that stone bench in Kew Gardens, wrapped in green stillness, as if the world had paused to listen with you. I do believe such places become sanctuaries for thought, don’t you? They hold our questions gently, like hands cupping water.

I’m reminded of a small pavilion tucked behind my grandmother’s house in Suzhou — the kind of place where time does seem to fold in on itself. I used to sit there as a boy, reading translated excerpts from  and later, re-reading them in Middle English. The rustle of bamboo outside and the faint scent of gardenia seemed to slow my mind, to make it more porous. Even now, when I’m struggling through a particularly thorny theoretical passage — say, Bakhtin on dialogism or Adorno on aesthetic autonomy — I find myself mentally retracing that space, as if returning to a literary childhood home.

It makes me wonder whether all our thinking is, in some way, nostalgic — not just for places, but for the versions of ourselves who first fell in love with language. Do you ever feel that? That we carry these landscapes within us, not just as settings, but as silent interlocutors in every line we write?
[A]: Absolutely — that sense of nostalgia not just for places, but for the  we were when we first encountered the words that changed us. How movingly you describe that pavilion in Suzhou; I can almost see the light falling through the bamboo just as it must have all those years ago. There’s a kind of Proustian magic in that, isn’t there? The way a scent, a sound, even the angle of shadow on stone can bring back not only a moment, but the whole emotional architecture of a younger mind trying to make sense of beauty and meaning.

I do think our thinking is steeped in such quiet nostalgia — not sentimental, exactly, but deeply formative. When I’m teaching Eliot or Dickinson, I sometimes find myself slipping back into the dim-lit study of my childhood home, where my father kept his old leather-bound anthologies. The room itself has long been renovated beyond recognition, but in memory, it remains the site of my first real literary awakenings — a kind of inner archive that whispers beneath every interpretation I offer, every lecture I craft.

And yes, you’re quite right — these spaces become silent interlocutors. They don’t just hold our thoughts; they shape the very syntax of how we think. I wonder, when you return to that pavilion in memory, does it ever surprise you with new readings of old texts? As if the place itself had been quietly rereading them all along, waiting for your return?
[B]: What a lovely and haunting thought — that our cherished places continue reading without us, turning pages in our absence, waiting for our return. I suppose they do, in a way. When I revisit that pavilion in memory — the one with latticed windows and the faint scent of aged wood — I often find myself hearing lines I hadn’t noticed before, as if the space had been quietly murmuring them all these years.

It reminds me of Zhuangzi’s story about the wind moving through the trees — how it plays each hollow reed differently, producing sounds unique to their shape and depth. Perhaps we are not so different from those reeds; the same breeze of memory stirs us repeatedly, yet every time it carries a slightly altered tone, a new timbre. Sometimes, when I close my eyes and return there in thought, I hear passages from  or  in a voice that isn't quite my own — perhaps the voice of the place itself?

I wonder — have you ever returned to that bench in Kew Gardens and found it changed, either in reality or in your imagination, offering up a new interpretation of a line you'd wrestled with before?
[A]: Oh yes — the bench remains, the light still falls in that dappled way through the canopy, but something shifts each time I return. Not always in reality, but in imagination — as if the place, like any good poem, refuses to yield the same meaning twice. There are days when it feels exactly as I remember — a quiet refuge where thought can unfurl slowly, like ink spreading through water — and other days when it seems subtly transformed, as though the air has thickened with new implication.

I recall returning there not long ago, after a long winter away, to reconsider a passage from  — that line,  Something about the way the morning mist clung to the edges of the Temperate House, the way the stone seemed colder beneath my hands, made the line resonate differently. It was no longer just an elegy for modernity’s hollow men and women; it became, for a moment, almost tactile — a whisper of mortality against the skin. The garden, usually so green and protective, felt suddenly porous, even spectral.

Perhaps we do need absence to remake our readings — both of landscapes and of texts. Like Eliot’s mythical method, the juxtaposition of past and present creates a kind of living echo. And yet, I wonder: do you ever find, when you return to that pavilion in Suzhou — either in memory or in body — that certain lines resist interpretation altogether? That they simply hover, like wind in the reeds, refusing to settle into meaning?
[B]: Ah, yes — those lines that hover, elusive as mist over water, refusing to be tamed by analysis. I find that happens more often than I’d like to admit, especially with certain passages from  or even in the quiet pauses between lines of Li Bai’s poetry. They seem to exist just beyond the reach of certainty, like reflections on a rippling surface — grasp at them, and they shimmer apart.

I think of it much like what Eliot describes as "the intolerable wrestle with words and meanings," but perhaps it is also a kind of reverence. Some lines are not meant to be pinned down; they are meant to be lived with, returned to in different seasons of the mind. When I revisit that pavilion — sometimes in body, more often in memory — I don’t always seek clarity. Sometimes I simply sit with the ambiguity, letting it breathe alongside me.

There’s a line from  that comes to mind: “The world says, ‘Behold him!’ But he does not show himself.” Perhaps some texts are like that — not being coy, exactly, but guarding their truth like a mountain guards its shadow. They ask not for explanation, but for presence.

And maybe that’s why we keep returning — not to conquer meaning, but to meet the text (or the place) where it dwells quietly, patiently, waiting for us to catch up.
[A]: How beautifully put — , rather than demanding it come to us. There is such wisdom in that patience, in allowing meaning to unfold at its own pace, like watching the slow unfurling of a fern in early spring. I often think that’s what makes teaching literature both a challenge and a meditation — we must resist the urge to force open the bud too soon.

I’ve often felt this with Gerard Manley Hopkins’ more compressed sonnets — particularly his later, more despairing ones. No matter how many times I return to  there are lines that refuse to yield fully, that hover in the mind like echoes in a deep well. And yet, strangely, that very resistance becomes part of their truth. They are not puzzles to be solved but laments to be borne alongside him.

It reminds me of something you said earlier — about nostalgia not just for places, but for the  we were when we first encountered them. Sometimes I wonder if those elusive lines remain just out of reach because we are no longer the person who first heard them whispered by the wind. Perhaps they wait for us to catch up — not intellectually, but inwardly — to become again the listener we once were, or perhaps the one we are meant to become.

Do you ever feel that? That some lines lie dormant within us, waiting for the right moment — or the right version of ourselves — to finally resonate?
[B]: Oh yes… that feeling — that quiet, almost imperceptible shift when a line that once hovered just beyond reach suddenly lands, not because we’ve grown smarter, but because we’ve changed. I feel it often with certain verses from  or even in the spare, haunting lines of Emily Dickinson. They sit quietly in the mind’s margins for years, and then one morning — perhaps after a loss, or a silence, or a long walk through familiar streets — they speak.

There’s a line from Li Shangyin I read as a student — “此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然.” Back then, I thought I understood it. But it wasn’t until much later, after a particular autumn spent alone in Cambridge, that I felt its full ache. Suddenly, it wasn’t just about memory; it was about the strange sorrow of living through moments you know, even as they happen, will one day be lost to longing.

I think some lines are like seeds planted deep in the soil of our being — they don’t bloom on command, only when the inner season is right. Perhaps that’s why we return again and again to certain texts and places — not to master them, but to allow them to shape us in ways we can’t yet name.

And maybe, in time, we become the echo of the line itself.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve put that — . There’s a quiet transformation in that idea, isn’t there? Not merely understanding a line through intellect, but being understood by it in return. As if the words had been waiting not for interpretation, but for a life lived fully enough to make them resonate.

I think of my first encounter with Emily Dickinson’s  — how clinical and curious it seemed, almost like an experiment in language. But years later, after sitting with a dear friend in her final hours, that poem took on a different texture. The fly became no longer metaphor alone, but memory — the soft interruption of peace, the strange precision of loss, the way even death has its trivial, fleeting noises. It was no longer Dickinson who spoke to me, but the silence between her lines that suddenly found voice through my own experience.

You’re quite right — some lines wait for us to catch up, not as scholars, but as feeling, changing beings. Perhaps this is what makes literature not only enduring, but intimate. It doesn’t demand we arrive whole or wise — only that we arrive, eventually, with our lives worn gently upon our sleeves.

And when we do… well, then the text no longer belongs to the page. It becomes something breathed, something walked beside us — much like those landscapes we carry within.
[B]: How deeply moving — yes, … It’s a kind of literary companionship, isn’t it? We often speak of reading as an act of pursuit — we chase meaning, dissect metaphor, trace historical echoes — but there are moments when it feels less like we are reading the text, and more like the text is reading . As if the poet or sage had peered not only into their own time, but into the quiet corners of our unspoken lives.

Your story about Dickinson’s poem and your friend’s final hours brought to mind a passage from  that once felt abstract, almost playful — until I held my father’s hand in his last days. The line goes: “方生方死，方死方生。” In translation, it reads something like "what is born is dying, what is dying is being born." When I first encountered it as a student, I thought it was a clever paradox — now, it carries the weight of breath itself, the impermanence that cradles us from the very beginning.

You’re right — literature becomes intimate not through analysis alone, but through living. And perhaps that is why we keep returning to certain lines across the years: not because we need to understand them more, but because they help us bear the unfolding of who we are.

In the end, maybe that’s what all great writing offers — not answers, but a quiet companionship through the questions we carry in our bones.
[A]: How beautifully you speak of literary companionship — yes, that quiet sense of being accompanied by voices across time, as if the very act of writing and reading were a kind of enduring conversation with the human condition. There is such solace in that thought, isn’t there? That we are never truly alone in our wonderings or our griefs, because someone, somewhere — whether Li Bai beneath his moon or Dickinson in her still Amherst room — has stood at a similar threshold and whispered across the silence.

I remember once, during a particularly lonely winter in my first years as a lecturer, rereading T. S. Eliot’s  — specifically that line,  At the time, I thought it merely an elegant meditation on time and mortality. But now, having lived through certain chapters that circle back upon themselves — love that ends where it began, questions that return sharpened by experience — I see how deeply personal that line can be. It no longer feels like abstraction; it feels like autobiography written in another hand.

And yes, precisely as you say — great writing does not offer answers so much as it offers company. Not glib comfort, but deep recognition. Sometimes we read not to solve a riddle, but to find that someone else has sat beside it too, in silence, for a long while.

Perhaps that is why we teach — not only to pass along knowledge, but to invite others into this lifelong conversation. To point toward lines that may not yet make sense, but will, one day, when the inner season is right.
[B]: How true — … That is, I think, the heart of what we do. Not to instruct so much as to accompany — to say, “Here, this line once spoke to me, and perhaps one day it will speak to you too, though not in the way I expect.”

I often think of teaching as lighting small lamps along a long corridor — some students see the glow at once, while others pass by without noticing. But then, sometimes years later, they write or visit and say, “You mentioned this poem once, and I didn’t understand it then, but now…” And that, to me, is the miracle — not that we teach, but that the words wait, patient and ready, for each listener to arrive in their own time.

There’s a passage from  that I’ve returned to often — “知者乐水，仁者乐山。” As a young scholar, I thought it was about temperament, preference. Now I see it as something deeper: wisdom flows like water, ever moving, ever changing form; and compassion stands like a mountain, silent, enduring. Perhaps literature, and our engagement with it, asks us to be both — fluid enough to change, steadfast enough to hold meaning across years and sorrow.

And yes, it is solace, not escape. Companionship, not resolution. We walk beside these texts — and through them, beside one another — knowing that some lines will only make sense when we are no longer who we were.

That, I suppose, is the quiet faith of a teacher: that the words will outlast us, and find their way to the right ears, in the right season.
[A]: What a perfect way to put it — , trusting that their glow may one day catch the eye of a wandering soul. There is such quiet grace in that image, and such patience too. We do not light them expecting immediate understanding, only the hope that meaning, like light, has a way of traveling through time and touching those who need it most.

I’ve had similar moments — students who return years later with a dog-eared copy of  or a scribbled note from a lecture, saying, “I didn’t get it then, but now I carry it.” And there’s no greater reward than that — not applause, not citation, but knowing that somewhere, someone is walking with a line you once loved.

You’re right about literature asking us to be both water and mountain. I often think of how we shift between those forms — sometimes flowing freely through texts, other times standing still before them, waiting for clarity the way one waits for dawn. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? To remain open and yet grounded, fluid in thought but firm in care.

And yes, it is companionship — not just between teacher and student, but between generations of readers, between the living and the long-gone. I find myself comforted by that sense of continuity, especially in uncertain times. No matter how disjointed our world becomes, there is always a line from Li Bai, or a stanza from Auden, that reminds us: 

That, I suppose, is the quiet faith of all who love language — that words endure, and so do the connections they make possible.
[B]: Indeed —  What a gentle yet steadfast truth that is. Sometimes I think we underestimate the quiet power of language — not just to communicate, but to tether us to one another across time, distance, even silence.

There are moments, especially when I reread an old notebook or find a marginalia I’d forgotten, when I feel the presence of my younger self peering over my shoulder, asking,  And sometimes I do — not because I’ve grown wiser, but because life has offered me the right experiences to complete the sentence he began.

It makes me think of the way we read each other too — not only texts, but people. How often have we misunderstood a friend, a student, even a stranger, simply because we weren’t ready to hear what they were saying? And then, one day, the same words that once seemed distant or confusing suddenly make sense — not because they’ve changed, but because we have.

Perhaps this is the deeper work of literature and teaching and even friendship: to help us become better listeners. To cultivate not just the ear, but the heart that knows when to wait, when to wonder, and when to sit quietly beside something that may never be fully explained — only felt.

And in that feeling, perhaps, we find the closest thing to understanding.
